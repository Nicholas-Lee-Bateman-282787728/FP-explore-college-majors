1323095,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0034G4P30,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 7]","For a film that is over two and a half hours long, there are so many plot holes in &#8216;Prisoners&#8217; I&#8217;m almost tempted to wish that it was three hours in length, and then again, maybe I just wish that it had never been made.  Watching the film in the first place took inner strength, since the subject matter is one that I have a very strong reaction to, but I expected to at least be rewarded with a thought provoking film that tested my inner calm but delivered a strong impact.Instead, I was left with confusion, frustration and indifference.Honestly, it was like screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski and director Denis Villeneuve thought that if you throw enough unnecessary details into a pot and stir them, the audience won&#8217;t notice the plot holes because they&#8217;ll be as distracted as Detective Loki by a bunch of stuff that makes no sense and means absolutely nothing.The premise of &#8216;Prisoners&#8217; is a relatively simple one.  The Dover&#8217;s and the Birch&#8217;s are neighbors and friends.  They hang out a lot, apparently.  One day, while they are socializing at the Birch residence, their young daughters leave to find a lost whistle and wind up missing.  They search to no avail and then the police are brought in and despite having a lead, there is nothing solid and no real evidence that they can get their hands on and Keller Dover soon feels the need to take matters into his own hand.  In a move that many fathers in this position would contemplate but never actually act out, Keller kidnaps the prime suspect, locks him in an abandoned building, and tortures him for answers he won&#8217;t divulge.  Keller just KNOWS that this young man (who is obviously mentally handicapped) has the answers to where these little girls are and so he continues to beat and torture him despite getting nothing out of him.  The Birch family becomes involved, but they remain at a distance (or at least as much as possible).  In the meantime, Detective Loki becomes consumed with unraveling the mystery of these vanished girls and follows up on the few leads he gets only to find himself preoccupied by the suspicious activity of Keller himself.As the days tick by, the prospect of finding these girls alive grows slim.I have SO MANY issues with this film that discussing them would almost take an entire day, but I&#8217;ll try and just sputter.  It really all boils down to a film about complete incompetence.  First off, these parents are kind of dense.  You let your little girls leave the house to wander down the street in search of a whistle, and despite the fact that you make it clear you never let them wander off alone you forget they ever left until hours have gone by, even with the knowledge of a creepy van on the street?  That doesn&#8217;t make sense to me at all.  Be attentive!  Next, Loki seems to be the ONLY person on the police team to be remotely interested in seeing these girls reunited with their families.  Despite having a suspect, they drop the ball and don&#8217;t even tail him, allowing him to be kidnapped and have the police be none the wiser.  Next, you have a suspect with a creepy van parked outside of his Aunt&#8217;s home, and she admits that he does that all the time, and yet you don&#8217;t investigate her house or her property for clues?  How is that?  Shouldn&#8217;t that have been the FIRST thing you did, even if you didn&#8217;t suspect her of anything?  Then you have Keller, who does what every man in that situation is thinking, and yet you allow yourself to become a complete monster by brutally assaulting a man who is three shades away from going full retard?  I mean, how does that solve anything?  This is an issue with me because you basically have a man beating on a child to get answers as to what he supposedly did with a child.  Maybe this is the moral dilemma we are supposed to face, but the film seems so uninterested in making Keller anything more than the savior of his children.Incompetence, both in character and in filmmaking.But let&#8217;s get into that incompetent filmmaking for a minute.  What about all those &#8216;details&#8217; that are all over the place?  You can spin your wheels all you want and color in every surface and draw those mazes all over the place, but at the end of the day it all feels like a waste of time.  Let&#8217;s have this creepy guy buy kid&#8217;s clothes and sneak into the victim&#8217;s homes that so the audience will think he had something to do with it only to have him off himself before he explains anything to anyone and then just drop it without really explaining anything (yes, I know who he was&#8230;but what was he doing in the Dover and Birch residence?).  Let&#8217;s throw mazes all over the walls and then shows a flashback with a book of mazes and a creepy message and then&#8230;not explain what the mazes have to do with anything!  Let&#8217;s give the kidnapper this ridiculous backstory and then never talk about it past a solitary comment.Let&#8217;s spend two and a half hours doing absolutely nothing but giving the impression that we are doing a LOT!And don&#8217;t even get me started on the ending.  This is what I mean about these holes in plot that just don&#8217;t add up.  Keller discovers the truth, but instead of informing the police and rushing to the rescue with Loki, he runs FROM the police and goes there alone, only to dig himself into a very deep hole (literally) and then, when all is said and done it takes quite a bit of time before the police do anything about investigating the area in which the crime took place (once again, wouldn&#8217;t that be the FIRST thing you did?).That stupid whistle.But the ensemble is great, right?  Sort of.  They all work to an extent, but the only one who really does a lot with what he&#8217;s given is Jake Gyllenhaal.  He actually works to flesh out Loki and his obsessions, while the others tend to give a glossed over variation of a solitary emotion.  Jackman yells and glares and then prays.  Davis cries.  Howard awkwardly holds his mouth in shock and looks like he wants to pee in his pants.  Maria Bello kind of disappears from the whole movie only to reappear as a loon.  Paul Dano doesn&#8217;t have the chance to do much but look scared and scream.  Melissa Leo gets saddled with a ridiculous character, and while she sells it I&#8217;m not quite sure I care for what she&#8217;s selling.Conceptually, &#8216;Prisoners&#8217; had promise.  As a father (of two young girls about the age of the ones kidnapped here), I was not looking forward to watching this.  My biggest fear is something like this.  Abuse is bad enough, but not knowing where and what is happening to your children is the WORST feeling in the world, and I have to admit, I was totally TEAM KELLER for the first half of this film, but &#8216;Prisoners&#8217; doesn&#8217;t know how to develop this concept in a way that feels authentic or even intelligent.  It all just feels so stupid.",1,Someone doesn&#8217;t know how to make a movie&#8230;,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,6982,"['film', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'long', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'plot', 'holes',

And homemade hillbilly knuckle tats. I have hillbilly blood in my genes, so this character could have been a member of my family. Or even myself.Detective Loki is no ordinary cop. This dude is a super sleuth. With slicked back trailer trash hair and an oxford shirt that's buttoned up all the way to the top, Loki looks more like a sleazy born-again Bible salesman than effective 5-0. Hugh Jackman is ultra-realistic as the dad who is beside himself when his daughter goes missing. Keller Dover uses father's intuition to track down the S.O.B. he thinks is responsible for his kid's disappearance. Then he lays the smack down on his dirty ass.Paul Dano plays the prime suspect, Alex Jones. Dim-witted, soft-spoken, with dorky glasses, this guy is definitely chester material. Jones is the type of individual who would orbit your child's playground during recess in a windowless cargo van with the words ""free candy"" spray-painted on the side. Instead, this character stereotype gets a convenient upgrade and drives a beat-up RV. Jones and his prehistoric wheels are the only witness to the freak disappearance of 2 young girls. Times a-ticking away when Dover decides to take matters into his own hands and relapses into a booze-fueled game of cat-and-mouse.You would think this movie's subject matter would be depressing, but it features enough scenery-chewing and action to keep this flick from making your heart sink. The characters are both bizarre and very memorable. The ending was neither overly optimistic nor sappy tearjerker. The 2 hour and 30 minute run time is a perfect length, and moves along at an optimized pace. Give this a shot.

He seems unsatisfied after talking to her though and knows she is hiding something and cant be trusted.  He then returns for a second visit to the house, where the plot gives us a surprising twist and Jackman becomes a hostage himself!the other stand-out performance is given to us by Jake G., who plays the cool tempered ever-persistent detective (who comes equipped with excellent instincts) investigating the case. throughout the film he is annoyed by a fumbling police chief and people who want to tell him how to do his job. he draws us in as he pursues the leads and clues. Frustrated with bad results and no solid leads, WE follow Jake G. to the house where Jackman was last scene and he engages the woman living there in an intense bloody scene where he gets a nasty blow to the head that leaves him loopy and disoriented, he nonetheless forces himself to keep going and finds the missing girl(who has been drugged heavily and is unconscious), bleeding profusely and knocked silly he then picks her up and runs to his patrol and throws her in the back, he knows he has to get her to the the hospital as fast as possible and he races through traffic driving like a madman wiping blood from his eyes the whole way barely holding on to consciousness himself trying to save the little girl!  these scenes are some of the best the movie has to offer, delivering on the suspense, tension, and emotions as mother and little girl are finally reunited. but we are left wandering what happened to Jackman who is now missing.  we follow the freshly bandaged up Jake G. whose instincts are  in high gear now as he begins searching for the missing father and we return (yet again) to the house where Jackman was last seen.  he looks around for a while and we hear the sound of a whistle (which was left by his daughter when she was a captive in the same hole) and then.....nothing...that's it!this ending is obvious, we know he is going to find the missing Jackman, but the suspense is not comparable to the other scenes in the movie as we are left hanging!  the movie for the most part is great, but the ending is a dud, and it leaves you disappointed wanting something more!",3,prisoners ending leaves you disappointed,1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,2723,"['film', 'very', 'typical', 'compared', 'other', 'kidnapping', 'movies', 'were', 'not', 'scenes', 'were', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Terence', 'Howard', 'fathers', 'two', 'missing', 'girls', 'torture', 'brutally', 'beat', 'suspected', 'retarded', 'kid', 'who', 'was', 'last', 'see', 'would', 'almost', 'be', 'exactly', 'majority', 'other', 'kidnapping', 'movies', 'surprisingly', 'plot', 'thicken', 'say', 'Jackman', 'shine', 'when', 'investigating', 'own', 'go', 'house', 'where', 'retarded', 'kid', 'talk', 'lady', 'also', 'there', 'unsatisfied', 'talking', 'though', 'hiding', 'something', 'cant', 'be', 'trusted', 'then', 'second', 'visit', 'house', 'where', 'plot', 'surprising', 'twist', 'Jackman', 'hostage', 'other', 'stand-out', 'performance', 'given', 'Jake', 'G.', 'who', 'cool', 'tempered', 'ever-persistent', 'detective', 'who', 'equipped', 'excellent', 'instincts', 'investigating', 'case', 'film', 'annoyed', 'fumbling', 'police', 'chief', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'tell', 'how', 'do', 'job', 'leads', 'clues', 'Frustrated', 'bad', 'results', 'solid', 'leads', 'WE', 'follow', 'Jake', 'G.', 'house', 'where', 'Jackman', 'was', 'last', 'scene', 'woman', 'living', 'there', 'intense', 'bloody', 'scene', 'where', 'nasty', 'blow', 'head', 'loopy', 'disoriented', 'nonetheless', 'keep', 'going', 'missing', 'girl', 'who', 'been', 'drugged', 'heavily', 'unconscious', 'bleeding', 'profusely', 'knocked', 'silly', 'then', 'up', 'patrol', 'back', 'get', 'hospital', 'as', 'fast', 'possible', 'traffic', 'driving', 'madman', 'wiping', 'blood', 'eyes', 'whole', 'way', 'barely', 'holding', 'consciousness', 'trying', 'save', 'little', 'girl', 'scenes', 'are', 'best', 'movie', 'offer', 'delivering', 'suspense', 'tension', 'emotions', 'mother', 'little', 'girl', 'are', 'finally', 'reunited', 'are', 'left', 'wandering', 'what', 'happened', 'Jackman', 'who', 'now', 'missing', 'follow', 'freshly', 'bandaged', 'up', 'Jake', 'G.', 'instincts', 'are', 'high', 'gear', 'now', 'searching', 'missing', 'father', 'return', 'yet', 'again', 'house', 'where', 'Jackman', 'was', 'last', 'seen', 'while', 'hear', 'sound', 'whistle', 'was', 'left', 'daughter', 'when', 'was', 'captive', 'same', 'hole', 'then', '..nothing', 'ending', 'obvious', 'know', 'going', 'find', 'missing', 'Jackman', 'suspense', 'not', 'comparable', 'other', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'left', 'hanging', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'great', 'ending', 'dud', 'disappointed', 'wanting', 'something', 'more']",N/A

The angry father feels imprisoned as does his family since they can't find their missing daughter, the missing daughter could be interpreted as a prisoner, the cop would fit the bill as well since he's on the case but getting nowhere most of the time... even the bad guys!  Yes, ""Prisoners"" is an interesting title for the movie.Anyway without a DOUBT the number one reason Prisoners is such a great film is due to the extraordinary acting of Hugh Jackman.  When I say he's awesome in his role as the parent who desperately wants to find his missing daughter, I wasn't expecting him to basically turn into a possessed monster!  He will do absolutely *anything* to find her and can be deliberate, intense, angry, vengeful... you name it!  I knew Hugh Jackson was a fantastic actor- I think most of us knew that already going into Prisoners, but I guess I either had a lapse of judgment and forgot or just didn't realize how powerful he can be in the roles he plays, especially given the very frightening and realistic material he has to work with here.Hugh Jackson is so believable in his role that he should be winning best actor of the year for a role this good.  Maybe I just got caught up in the mystery and the suspense of the film so much that I'm simply blinded with bias so I apologize if it sounds like I'm exaggerating a bit, but he deserves *some* kind of accolade for his role.  Let's get to the movie instead of all this Hugh Jackman gushing shall we? :)I don't want to spoil what happens for a good chunk of the film but I might have to since not mentioning it is almost unavoidable.  This is a minor spoiler however, this next part.  Hugh finds and captures a mentally disturbed man who has the mindset of a 10-year old.  Hugh believes this man is responsible for the kidnapping of not only his daughter, but his friends daughter as well.  Hugh even hears the man singing a song that his daughter was singing the day she disappeared, sending distinct warning signs that he's the guilty one.  Hugh basically kidnaps and tortures the man, and keeps the body hidden in an old rundown and abandoned apartment building.  When Hugh's done torturing for the day, he returns the next day and keeps going without remorse.  Don't try to reason with Hugh either- he already thought the situation out clearly and won't let a simple disagreement that what he's doing is wrong stop him from processing with the torturing.  Basically Hugh's absolutely crazy in the head and proves he's willing to do anything to find his daughter.  He takes it to a whole new level!However the other major chunk of storytelling is about the cop (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) who ALMOST ruins the movie in my opinion due to his poor acting, nonchalant attitude, total disinterest in doing his job and finding the two daughters, feeling inconvenienced whenever Hugh Jackman expresses rage and accuses him of not trying hard enough (which is correct, the cop's NOT trying hard enough to find the two daughters- at least for a while).  Now some of this can be attributed to the storytelling- the writers wanted a laidback and lazy cop to search for clues in this small town.  However some of it is completely unintentional.  Jake just doesn't possess the right kind of emotions depending on the situation at hand.  He often comes across more like a rookie unaware how to react in certain situations.  Not sure if intentional or not.  I think someone else should have played the cop role instead.This movie even shows the mother/wife of Hugh Jackman, and how distraught and unable she is to cope with the disappearance of her daughter in believable fashion so she stays in bed depressed all the time.  While a good chunk of this movie is slow-moving, mystery-related drama, there's clearly *another* chunk of the writing that is suspenseful concerning how Hugh Jackman responds to the man he captures.  This is a mighty fine movie regardless of Jake Gyllenhaal almost dragging it down.  The only problem is the end of the film.  It doesn't provide the kind of closure that it clearly COULD have.  The movie needs at least one more minute to wrap everything up.  I mean they were *so* close!  Just one more minute would have done it!  Anyway the final 20 minutes are downright AWESOME despite the ending.  Several twists and turns.

So, if you're looking for a lighthearted film that makes you feel happily satisfied, you should stay away.It suspensefully and skillfully depicts that people are not what they seem to be. Just like in reality, people cannot detect killers by judging their appearances. People were shocked when they found out the killers were the people they thought they knew well.What makes it unsettling is the tunnel vision of one of the characters that brings tragic consequences.  This strikes a chord with me because I've seen it repeated many times in real life as shown on Dateline NBC shows. Hugh Jackman's acting convincingly increases the unsettling of the picture. His grief and actions, most of the time, reflects those of a father whose child was kidnapped.The atmosphere is heavy and very depressing. Usually, the outdoor scenes are in gray or dark colors. They amplify the depression.It contains many twists that make it more suspenseful. For example, the ending is different than most of the others of the same genre.According to box office mojo dot com, below are the financial figures of this picture:Production Budget: $46 millionDomestic:  $60,604,828+ Foreign:  $52,400,000= Worldwide:  $113,004,828So, it took in 67 million dollars more than its production cost.

I am a fan of crime dramas and with this type of plot I'm always hoping for something different and surprising.  Unfortunately, although the movie throws in a couple of twists in an attempt to mislead the viewer, I thought the ultimate outcome was predictable and similar to movies/TV shows I've seen in the past.The movie has a big name cast and I felt that Jake Gyllenhaal (as Detective Loki) was very edgy and the most  interesting.  Paul Dano (the prime suspect) and Melissa Leo (the suspect's aunt) were very good.  Hugh Jackman (as Keller Dover, one of the missing girl's father) had the lead role in the movie and I was not overly impressed by his acting.  He was basically a vigilante type father and I didn't like his character and didn't sympathize with his plight.The length of the movie (at 2 hours 33 minutes) was overly long.  It seemed to me that High Jackman was given a lot of screen time to vent his anger at the detective and prime suspect.  *Possible Spoiler Alert Follows*.  The filmmakers must have thought that Jackman's  kidnapping and torture of the prime suspect was a highlight of the film and warranted more screen time.

Veteran Coen Brothers cinematographer Roger Deakins lends his expertise to newcomer writer Aaron Guzikowski and Director Denis Villeneuve.  You can certainly see the influence of Deakins throughout the film and his beautiful take on reality in a chaotic situation.This is one of those films that you don't want to know a thing about before you go. You don't even want to hear people brushstroke over it because even that is something you don't want to hear. For that matter, I won't even go close to going there. I will give you a brief introduction to what you should expect. Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and his wife Grace (Maria Bello), walk down the street to their neighbors, Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) and Nancy (Viola Davis). They each have a daughter and along the course of the evening, those two daughters disappear without a trace.""Prisoners"" is a gut-wrenching and fast running two and a-half hour movie. It is filmed in such a way that the events that unfold could involve you, your neighbor, somebody across town and on your local news.  Along with the way the movie is filmed and told, it is gifted with phenomenal actors that bring the reality of the situation to the surface.It is an exhausting an emotionally filled movie from top to bottom and its subject matter will have your stomach in knots until the credits roll.  This, quite simply, is what movies are all about. Too often these days, movies make you feel nothing. Too many directors and writers are concerned with what you see and forget that first and foremost, what makes great cinema and long lasting cinema, is the feeling it leaves in your stomach and soul. At one point, Keller Dover's sadness effected me so much that I felt as if I was actually him or in the least, one of his family members or a great friend.""Prisoners"" is the kind of movie we should be flocking to the theaters to see until Hollywood gets the message that we want to feel something.  Sure, dazzle us with visuals, but until you relay empathy in your audience members, you have wasted millions of dollars and time.  ""Prisoners"" is tremendous filmmaking.

1323158,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B0034G4P30,C. Sawin,"[5, 6]","The cast for ""Prisoners"" may be the most impressive ensemble of any film released in 2013. Hugh Jackman plays a father who is so committed to finding his daughter that he pushes himself beyond any sort of physical or mental limits any ordinary person may have had in the same situation. Jackman's performance is passionate, unstable, and driven. In fact, Jackman has never been better. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a remarkable performance, as well. Detective Loki will stop at nothing to solve whatever case he's put on and he completely submerges himself in the investigation. The one thing that may stick out from Gyllenhaal's performance is the extreme way he blinks in certain situations. It may be an attribute of his character not getting enough sleep (his eyes appear really bloodshot at times, as well), but it's more than a little noticeable nevertheless.The rest of the cast seems to pick and choose their moments. Paul Dano's part is rather small, but the sleaziness Dano has become notorious for comes right along with him. Viola Davis portrays a mother at her wit's end perfectly. She has a fantastically emotional scene with Paul Dano that is superb. However, Maria Bello and Terrence Howard are a little disappointing. Bello mostly just whines and stays drugged up the entire film while Howard seems to repeat the same three lines of dialogue every time he opens his mouth. Howard has chosen some less than stellar projects to be a part of the past two years. It feels like he's still shaking off the absurd behavior and overall terribleness he was a part of in films like ""Red Tails"" and ""Dead Man Down.""Denis Velleneuve's crime thriller may seem exhausting looking at its 153-minute duration and it is in actuality a little long, but its pace is also very controlled. Think David Fincher's ""Zodiac."" It may be lengthy, but the performances are outstanding and the journey is never not intriguing. It's as if the viewers are attempting to piece together the clues that Detective Loki uncovers right as he discovers them and you're kept guessing until the very end.Other than the film's emphasis on mazes, religion is also an important factor of ""Prisoners."" Keller mutters The Lord's Prayer as his son Ralph (Dylan Minnette) shoots his first deer in the opening moments of the film and you also learn that Holly Jones (Melissa Leo), the aunt and current guardian of Alex Jones, used to be a devout Christian. ""Waging a war on God,"" is something you find yourself pondering long after the film is over. After discussing the film with others, some may think the film focuses on torture a little too much. Truth be told, ""Prisoners"" would be completely different without the torture element. Alex Jones is the only lead anyone has for nearly the entire film, so naturally doing whatever it takes to make him talk seems reasonable. That doesn't mean it's not taken too far, but the reasoning is sound.""Prisoners"" is one of the most contemplative and fulfilling films of the year. While the film does leave you with a handful of questions, you'll find yourself thinking about the film days after you see it. Unpredictable and extraordinary, ""Prisoners"" throws you right into an unsolvable investigation that takes several unexpected turns.",5,"Pray for the best, but prepare for the worst",1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,3247,"['cast', 'Prisoners', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'impressive', 'ensemble', 'film', 'released', '2013', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'father', 'who', 'so', 'committed', 'finding', 'daughter', 'sort', 'physical', 'mental', 'limits', 'ordinary', 'person', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'same', 'situation', 'Jackman', 'performance', 'passionate', 'unstable', 'driven', 'fact', 'Jackman', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'Detective', 'Loki', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'solve', 'case', 'put', 'completely', 'investigation', 'one', 'thing', 'may', 'stick', 'out', 'Gyllenhaal', 'performance', 'extreme', 'way', 'certain', 'situations', 'may', 'be', 'attribute', 'character', 'not', 'getting', 'enough', 'sleep', 'eyes', 'appear', 'really', 'bloodshot', 'times', 'well', 'more', 'little', 'noticeable', 'nevertheless.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'pick', 'choose', 'moments', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'part', 'rather', 'small', 'sleaziness', 'Dano', 'become', 'notorious', 'right', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'mother', 'wit', 'end', 'perfectly', 'fantastically', 'emotional', 'scene', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'superb', 'However', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'are', 'little', 'disappointing', 'Bello', 'mostly', 'just', 'whines', 'stays', 'drugged', 'up', 'entire', 'film', 'Howard', 'repeat', 'same', 'three', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'time', 'mouth', 'Howard', 'chosen', 'less', 'stellar', 'projects', 'be', 'part', 'past', 'two', 'years', 'still', 'shaking', 'off', 'absurd', 'behavior', 'overall', 'terribleness', 'was', 'part', 'films', 'Red', 'Tails', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Down', 'Denis', 'Velleneuve', 'crime', 'thriller', 'may', 'seem', 'exhausting', 'looking', '153-minute', 'duration', 'actuality', 'little', 'long', 'pace', 'also', 'very', 'controlled', 'Think', 'David', 'Fincher', 'Zodiac', 'may', 'be', 'lengthy', 'performances', 'are', 'outstanding', 'journey', 'never', 'not', 'intriguing', 'viewers', 'are', 'attempting', 'piece', 'together', 'clues', 'Detective', 'Loki', 'uncovers', 'right', ""'re"", 'kept', 'guessing', 'very', 'end.Other', 'film', 'emphasis', 'mazes', 'religion', 'also', 'important', 'factor', 'Prisoners', 'Keller', 'Lord', 'Prayer', 'son', 'Ralph', 'Dylan', 'Minnette', 'shoots', 'first', 'deer', 'opening', 'moments', 'film', 'also', 'learn', 'Holly', 'Jones', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'aunt', 'current', 'guardian', 'Alex', 'Jones', 'used', 'be', 'devout', 'Christian', 'Waging', 'war', 'God', 'something', 'find', 'pondering', 'long', 'film', 'discussing', 'film', 'others', 'may', 'think', 'film', 'torture', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'Prisoners', 'would', 'be', 'completely', 'different', 'torture', 'element', 'Alex', 'Jones', 'only', 'lead', 'anyone', 'nearly', 'entire', 'film', 'so', 'naturally', 'doing', 'make', 'talk', 'reasonable', ""n't"", 'mean', 'not', 'taken', 'too', 'far', 'reasoning', 'sound', 'Prisoners', 'one', 'most', 'contemplative', 'fulfilling', 'films', 'year', 'film', 'leave', 'handful', 'questions', ""'ll"", 'find', 'thinking', 'film', 'days', 'see', 'Unpredictable', 'extraordinary', 'Prisoners', 'right', 'unsolvable', 'investigation', 'several', 'unexpected', 'turns']",N/A

1323167,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B0034G4P30,DanD,"[0, 0]","Don't let the big-name stars fool you: PRISONERS has the trappings of a low-budget, independent character study, the kind that rarely finds its audience via the big screen.  Yet, thanks to word-of-mouth and Hugh Jackman, PRISONERS actually became something of a hit.  Goes to show you that occasionally, Hollywood gets it right.The film follows the Dover and Birch families, whose young daughters go missing over Thanksgiving.  The police quickly find a suspect, but don't have enough evidence to hold him.  Keller Dover, one of the grieving fathers, decides to take matters into his own hands, while determined police detective Loki follows up all possible leads.  The two stories frequently overlap, as suspects are eliminated and the case spirals ever onward.Let's get one thing straight: PRISONERS is about half an hour, maybe forty-five minutes too long.  There's a lot of padding here; granted, it's meant to be realistic (&#34;hey, coincidences exist&#34;), but it comes off as fluff meant to make this journey last a little longer.  That being said, the story here is a doozy, a solid script elevated by stellar acting.  As Dover, Hugh Jackman delivers a performance that slowly builds on itself.  His character's actions are never fully justified, but Jackman still gives the role a level of intensity that is both fantastic and off-putting (in a good way).  Paul Dano, as the prime suspect, disappears into his role, as he tends to do; every performance he gives is entirely different and captivating.  Viola Davis, Maria Bello, Terrence Howard, and especially Melissa Leo give fantastic turns.  But it is the film's other lead, Jake Gyllenhaal, who comes off as the true stand-out.  His performance is Oscar-worthy, at times over-the-top, yet on other occasions subtle and nuanced.  In a film filled with good actors doing great work, Gyllenhaal manages to stand out from the rest.A disclaimer, though: PRISONERS is not easy to watch.  Not because it's about child abduction, though that will upset some.  More so, it's the fact that PRISONERS doesn't shy away from moral complexities.  There are some thoroughly disturbing images (thanks to master cinematographer Roger Deakins) that will upset many viewers.

Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[6, 16]","""Prisoners"" 2013 Fine Performances, Evocative Direction, Screwball ScriptI wanted to see ""Prisoners"" after I saw the trailer. Alas, the trailer contains all the best parts of the movie. Suburban parents celebrating Thanksgiving slowly come to realize that their two daughters are missing. The trailer featured quiet, dark scenes of increasing menace and despair, shot in realistic, autumnal, suburban settings. The trailer promised big, big stars: Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello as one set of parents and Viola Davis and Terence Howard as the other, Jake Gyllenhaal as the police detective, Paul Dano as the suspect and Melissa Leo as the suspect's adoptive parent. The trailer promised an intelligent thriller that would interrogate how far an ethical person could go in attempting to rescue his daughter from an abductor. The trailer also seemed to suggest an examination of how law enforcement responds, for better or worse, in child abduction cases.The first twenty minutes of ""Prisoners"" delivered what I'd hoped for based on the trailer, but I was hyper-aware that I was watching scene after scene I'd already seen in the trailer.Around the time that an unlikely body was found in an unlikely spot, and a fist met a face several times more than was necessary to make any point, but certainly enough times to satisfy a filmgoer's sick, sadistic bloodlust, the movie went off the rails for me, abandoned all its seriousness and intelligence, and became sensational gore and commercial pap. I was so let down I wanted to leave the theater, but I stayed because I'd roped two friends into seeing this with me.""Prisoners"" is a whodunit so there's a limit to what I can say without revealing any spoilers. I can say this. Jake Gyllenhaal powerfully performs a dedicated police detective. Hugh Jackman exercises his neck veins a lot, and his American accent is wobbly but okay. Terence Howard, Viola Davis, and Maria Bello are given criminally little to do. Viola Davis has one of the most interesting scenes in the movie. This scene is only a minute or two long and it is not developed at all. That is a shame because the scene is the moral crux of the film. And the film does nothing with it; the filmmakers went with implausible sensationalism and sadism rather than substance. Paul Dano, as the suspect, and Melissa Leo, as his adoptive mother, both give powerhouse performances in very challenging roles.Denis Villeneuve's direction is flawless. He avoids explosive stunts and theatrics with his camera. His moves are slow and quiet, even while filming ugly violence. I'd like to see his work on a better script.There are many attempts to make the movie deeper than it is. There are many scenes initially shot through dirty glass. ""Through a glass darkly"" is a line from the Bible. Ooo big symbolism. Wow. There are many crosses, including one hanging from the rearview mirror in Keller - Hugh Jackman's - truck. Wow. Heavy. I just may think something ... no, I'd rather watch snakes. Oh, yes. There are snakes. Some understand Satan as taking snake form in Genesis. Heavy. Profound! Yeah, not really. Just bizarrely implausible. There are strange character names. Hugh Jackman's first name is ""Keller"" which brings to mind the blind and deaf Helen Keller, or maybe the word ""Killer."" Jake Gyllenhaal is Detective Loki. Loki is the trickster God of Norse mythology. This is all pretty high school.There are two scenes and one character treatment in this film that I found completely implausible. The two scenes are essential to the plot. I can't describe these two scenes but I can say that one is utterly implausible because of surveillance. The action of the film takes place within hours and days of a child abduction. Not only police, but also media and neighbors would be keeping an eagle eye on all suspects. Another scene is implausible because it demands that we forget everything we've been told about a key character. One character treatment is unbelievable to me because a very unlikely character is depicted as being as heroic, in his way, as John McCain. Not plausible. I also found the final resolution of the crime to be something that would only occur in a writer's imagination, and the ending to be pointlessly cute.Again, the opening scenes of the dawning awareness that a child has been abducted are powerful, but the film totally lost me with its comic book sensationalism, sadism, and - I have to say it - stupidity.",2,"Fine Performances, Evocative Direction, Screwball Script",1379808000,"09 22, 2013",2013,4439,"['Prisoners', '2013', 'Fine', 'Performances', 'Evocative', 'Direction', 'Screwball', 'ScriptI', 'wanted', 'see', 'Prisoners', 'saw', 'trailer', 'Alas', 'trailer', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'Suburban', 'parents', 'celebrating', 'Thanksgiving', 'slowly', 'come', 'realize', 'two', 'daughters', 'are', 'missing', 'trailer', 'featured', 'quiet', 'dark', 'scenes', 'increasing', 'menace', 'despair', 'shot', 'realistic', 'autumnal', 'suburban', 'settings', 'trailer', 'promised', 'big', 'big', 'stars', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'one', 'set', 'parents', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'Terence', 'Howard', 'other', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'police', 'detective', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'suspect', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'suspect', 'adoptive', 'parent', 'trailer', 'promised', 'intelligent', 'thriller', 'would', 'interrogate', 'how', 'far', 'ethical', 'person', 'could', 'go', 'attempting', 'rescue', 'daughter', 'abductor', 'trailer', 'also', 'seemed', 'suggest', 'examination', 'how', 'law', 'enforcement', 'responds', 'better', 'worse', 'child', 'abduction', 'cases.The', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'Prisoners', 'delivered', 'what', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'based', 'trailer', 'was', 'hyper-aware', 'was', 'watching', 'scene', 'scene', ""'d"", 'already', 'seen', 'trailer.Around', 'time', 'unlikely', 'body', 'was', 'found', 'unlikely', 'spot', 'fist', 'met', 'face', 'several', 'times', 'more', 'was', 'necessary', 'make', 'point', 'certainly', 'enough', 'times', 'satisfy', 'filmgoer', 'sick', 'sadistic', 'bloodlust', 'movie', 'went', 'rails', 'abandoned', 'seriousness', 'intelligence', 'became', 'sensational', 'gore', 'commercial', 'pap', 'was', 'so', 'let', 'down', 'wanted', 'leave', 'theater', 'stayed', ""'d"", 'roped', 'two', 'friends', 'seeing', 'Prisoners', 'whodunit', 'limit', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'revealing', 'spoilers', 'can', 'say', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'powerfully', 'dedicated', 'police', 'detective', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'neck', 'lot', 'American', 'accent', 'wobbly', 'okay', 'Terence', 'Howard', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'are', 'given', 'criminally', 'little', 'do', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'movie', 'scene', 'only', 'minute', 'two', 'long', 'not', 'developed', 'shame', 'scene', 'moral', 'crux', 'film', 'film', 'nothing', 'filmmakers', 'went', 'implausible', 'sensationalism', 'sadism', 'rather', 'substance', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'suspect', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'adoptive', 'mother', 'give', 'powerhouse', 'performances', 'very', 'challenging', 'roles.Denis', 'Villeneuve', 'direction', 'flawless', 'explosive', 'stunts', 'theatrics', 'camera', 'moves', 'are', 'slow', 'quiet', 'even', 'filming', 'ugly', 'violence', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'work', 'better', 'are', 'many', 'attempts', 'make', 'movie', 'deeper', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'initially', 'shot', 'dirty', 'glass', 'glass', 'darkly', 'line', 'Bible', 'Ooo', 'big', 'symbolism', 'Wow', 'are', 'many', 'crosses', 'including', 'one', 'hanging', 'rearview', 'mirror', 'Keller', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'truck', 'Wow', 'Heavy', 'just', 'may', 'think', 'something', ""'d"", 'rather', 'watch', 'snakes', 'Oh', 'yes', 'are', 'snakes', 'understand', 'Satan', 'taking', 'snake', 'form', 'Genesis', 'Heavy', 'Profound', 'Yeah', 'not', 'really', 'Just', 'bizarrely', 'implausible', 'are', 'strange', 'character', 'names', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'first', 'name', 'Keller', 'mind', 'blind', 'deaf', 'Helen', 'Keller', 'maybe', 'word', 'Killer', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Detective', 'Loki', 'Loki', 'trickster', 'God', 'Norse', 'mythology', 'pretty', 'high', 'school.There', 'are', 'two', 'scenes', 'one', 'character', 'treatment', 'film', 'found', 'completely', 'implausible', 'two', 'scenes', 'are', 'essential', 'plot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'describe', 'two', 'scenes', 'can', 'say', 'one', 'utterly', 'implausible', 'surveillance', 'action', 'film', 'place', 'hours', 'days', 'child', 'abduction', 'Not', 'only', 'police', 'also', 'media', 'neighbors', 'would', 'be', 'keeping', 'eagle', 'eye', 'suspects', 'scene', 'implausible', 'forget', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'been', 'told', 'key', 'character', 'One', 'character', 'treatment', 'unbelievable', 'very', 'unlikely', 'character', 'depicted', 'as', 'being', 'heroic', 'way', 'John', 'McCain', 'Not', 'plausible', 'also', 'found', 'final', 'resolution', 'crime', 'be', 'something', 'would', 'only', 'occur', 'writer', 'imagination', 'ending', 'be', 'pointlessly', 'cute.Again', 'opening', 'scenes', 'dawning', 'awareness', 'child', 'been', 'abducted', 'are', 'powerful', 'film', 'totally', 'lost', 'comic', 'book', 'sensationalism', 'sadism', 'have', 'say', 'stupidity']",N/A

1323176,A2Q42ON9CEHR4O,B0034G4P30,David R. Eastwood,"[2, 4]","THE PRISONERS (2013) is basically well acted by both its stars (Hugh Jackman and Jake Gylllenhaal) and its supporting cast (Maria Bello, Terrence Howard, Viola Davis, and Paul Dano), BUT from the very outset its IMPLAUSIBLE SCREENPLAY goes from one huge plot hole to another.Following the opening scene in which a teenage boy is forced to shoot a deer by his RW survivalist father (played by Hugh Jackman), we see fresh venison being taken to the survivalist's BEST FRIEND'S big house for a two-family dinner ... after everyone in each family has hugged and kissed everyone else. Amazingly, and without any explanation, Jackman's wife and son and little daughter are ALL BEST FRIENDS with this other family, which just happens to be the only black family shown in the semi-rural small town in the entire movie. Given my own seven-decade experience of racism in America in New England, in the South, in the Midwest, and in the Northwest, I found this incredible as a story premise.HERE BE A FEW SPOILERS - The first two of four prisoners referred to by the title are the two young daughters of Jackman and Howard (one white; one black) who within a very short time are kidnapped in broad daylight. (Later, two adults are held as prisoners by people NOT associated with the police.) Within minutes of the kidnapping, however, a super detective (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) apprehends a suspect, a retarded young man (Paul Dano), who seems to have been living with his elderly aunt, but (apparently) the police have the wrong man in custody and have to release him. This does NOT sit well with Hugh Jackman's macho, take-charge self-image: he decides to do some ""enhanced interrogation"" of his own, with the very reluctant help of his beloved black buddy (Terrence Howard). Prolonged GRAPHIC TORTURE SCENES ensue.HERE BE A FEW MORE SPOILERS - Meanwhile Det. Gyllenhaal, who has never taken on a case without solving it, begins to suspect that a SERIAL KILLER is involved and tracks down an alternative suspect who has more than a few screws loose ... and while engaged in his own ""enhanced interrogation,"" Det. G. goofs up and brings about the death of that new suspect.BUT WAIT, IT GETS WILDER - Just when there seems to be a dead end, as LUCK would have it, the little black girl CONVENIENTLY is able to escape her captor and reunite with her family! And somehow she puts Hugh Jackman on to a new trail ... which has a very bad outcome for him - besides him being shot. (At this point the audience knows for certain WHO the perverted serial killer is - and that ""answer"" is LITERALLY unbelievable.)But of course there is MORE to come. Det. Gyllenhaal also discovers who that pervert is, and he too is shot (in the head) but keeps on ticking and SAVES not one but TWO prisoners of the pervert ... but not (tweet) at the same time (tweet).The audience (tweet) expects Det. Gyllenhaal (who has NOT been suspended for causing the death of a suspect in custody and who immediately is released from the hospital and NOT kept under observation) to achieve some sort of additional unbelievable SUCCESS despite his head wound (tweet), and he (tweet) does so ... in exactly the (tweet) way that any eight-year-old who is halfway paying attention to this film will (tweet) easily (tweet) guess fifteen minutes before it (tweet, tweet) ends.If I were giving this film a letter grade, in my judgment it deserves a ""D-"".

But seeing &#34;Prisoners&#34; put the entire genre in a whole new realm.Here's the scoop. Set in rural Pennsylvania, two families are celebrating Thanksgiving when their two youngest daughters go missing. The police are called and the investigation begins. But the one father, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) has his own ideas of what happened and pursues his own line of investigation. Both his work and that of the detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) take some surprising turns.It's difficult to express how incredibly good this film is. Famed d.p. Roger Deakins lensed it and keeps the sheen off. This does not have the gloss of a Hollywood production. This is middle class America and you feel as though you are there with these people. The mud, rain, snow and budget furniture are things most of us have experienced. And the relationship between Gyllenhaal and his Captain is peculiar to say the least. Let's look at Gyllenhaal's Loki. First, he's named after the Norse God. He's great at what he does, But this is no slick, college educated guy. He looks as though he came up from the street. He's got a big tattoo on his neck. Others on his hands and knuckles (I'd love to know what those symbols represent). His clothes don't fit well and he seems to have no family or close friends. What an interesting character. And Hugh Jackman. I'm not a big fan of his because I just don't think he's that good, but he does a real stand-up job here. Far better than I've ever seen him. Same with Terrence Howard. This, for my dollar, is his best work. But Maria Bello, Paul Dano, Viola Davis, Melissa Leo all turn in great performances.What really shines here is the script. You think you have things nailed down but it keeps twisting up to the end. And these aren't cheap plot turns. Though at first you might be scratching your head, all the loose ends come together in a very realistic fashion. The hand of God does come down in one crucial scene and part of the climax is a bit Hollywood but the rest is so outstanding it's easy to forgive it its weaknesses. And the ending. What a total creepfest.If you liked &#34;Gone Baby Gone&#34; or &#34;Mystic River&#34; this is a must see.",4,"Move Over ""Gone Baby Gone""",1381708800,"10 14, 2013",2013,2328,"['stuff', 'good', 'film', 'great', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'elusive', '34', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', '34', 'kidnap', 'based', 'plot', 'one', 'favorites', 'seeing', '34', 'Prisoners', '34', 'put', 'entire', 'genre', 'whole', 'new', 'realm.Here', 'scoop', 'Set', 'rural', 'Pennsylvania', 'two', 'families', 'are', 'celebrating', 'Thanksgiving', 'when', 'two', 'youngest', 'daughters', 'go', 'missing', 'police', 'are', 'called', 'investigation', 'one', 'father', 'Keller', 'Dover', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'own', 'ideas', 'what', 'happened', 'pursues', 'own', 'line', 'investigation', 'work', 'detective', 'Loki', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'take', 'surprising', 'turns.It', 'difficult', 'express', 'how', 'incredibly', 'good', 'film', 'Famed', 'd.p', 'Roger', 'lensed', 'sheen', 'off', 'not', 'have', 'gloss', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'middle', 'class', 'America', 'feel', 'are', 'there', 'people', 'mud', 'rain', 'snow', 'budget', 'furniture', 'are', 'things', 'most', 'have', 'experienced', 'relationship', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Captain', 'peculiar', 'say', 'least', 'Let', 'look', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Loki', 'First', 'named', 'Norse', 'God', 'great', 'what', 'slick', 'college', 'educated', 'guy', 'came', 'up', 'street', 'got', 'big', 'tattoo', 'neck', 'Others', 'hands', 'knuckles', ""'d"", 'love', 'know', 'what', 'symbols', 'represent', 'clothes', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'well', 'have', 'family', 'close', 'friends', 'What', 'interesting', 'character', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'good', 'real', 'stand-up', 'job', 'here', 'Far', 'better', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Same', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'dollar', 'best', 'work', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'turn', 'great', 'performances.What', 'really', 'shines', 'here', 'script', 'think', 'have', 'things', 'nailed', 'down', 'twisting', 'up', 'end', 'are', ""n't"", 'cheap', 'plot', 'turns', 'first', 'might', 'be', 'scratching', 'head', 'loose', 'ends', 'come', 'together', 'very', 'realistic', 'fashion', 'hand', 'God', 'come', 'down', 'one', 'crucial', 'scene', 'part', 'climax', 'bit', 'Hollywood', 'rest', 'so', 'outstanding', 'easy', 'forgive', 'weaknesses', 'ending', 'What', 'total', 'creepfest.If', 'liked', '34', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', '34', '34', 'Mystic', 'River', '34', 'must', 'see']",N/A

1323202,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B0034G4P30,FNDNreview,"[34, 45]","Hugh Jackman continues to be a huge draw and a well-respected A-list actor in Hollywood.  Even though he earned his popularity as the comic book character, Wolverine, in the X-Men films, it would appear his comic book drawing power isn't what it used to be.  Jackman's most recent film, The Wolverine, was a bit of a disappointment and prompted questions about whether or not his tenure of playing the character might be coming to an end in the not so distant future.  While this might disappoint comic book fans, it might not be the worst news since Jackman continues to thrive in dramatic roles.  Within the last year alone, Jackman has been nominated for an Academy Award and won a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy for his portrayal of Jean Valjean in Les Mis&eacute;rables.  Now, Hugh Jackman is back in a dramatic role once again for the mystery thriller, Prisoners.Directed by Denis Villeneuve (Incendies), Prisoners stars Hugh Jackman as Keller Dover, a parent that is severely distraught after the sudden disappearance of his young daughter, Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) and her friend, Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons).  The local police quickly become involved as Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), a detective that has yet to leave a case unresolved, quickly targets Alex Jones (Paul Dano), as the potential kidnapper, despite a lack of evidence.  Regardless of the fact that Jones is a mentally challenged man and appears to be innocent, Keller decides to kidnap him and torture him anyway, believing he's the one holding the girls.  As the days pass and time continues to run out, Loki focuses on a variety of different possible suspects, all the while Dover and Joy's father, Franklin (Terrence Howard), continue their abusive attempts to make Jones reveal the whereabouts of the girls.  Viola Davis, Maria Bello, and David Dastmalchian also star in supporting roles.First and foremost - as far as the story goes, Prisoners is an enjoyable thrill-ride from start to finish.  At no point does this story ever feel slow or lack entertainment value.  There is enough happening within this story that it will keep you guessing about which one of the characters is guilty, all the while wondering to what the extent the main characters will go to find out where their daughters are being held.  However, there is a bit too much story than there really needs to be - often spending too much time introducing new characters with no other purpose than to throw viewers off about whom the real guilty party turns out to be.  Naturally, the introduction of these characters causes the plot to balloon out to the point that the film might have some moviegoers checking their watch.  But, if the biggest complaint is about the movie being 15 minutes too long, that's usually a good sign for the overall quality of the flick.Co-starring alongside Hugh Jackman is another Academy Award nominee, Jake Gyllenhaal.  Playing a relentless detective, Gyllenhaal most certainly shines in this role, although no more or less than in his most recent endeavors, such as End of Watch, Love & Other Drugs, and Zodiac.  Gyllenhaal has become a household name himself and although his scenes are not as emotionally involved as Jackman's scenes, he still gives a standout performance.  His slicked-back hair, nervous ticks, and tattoos depict him to be a hard-nosed, overzealous law enforcer that pushes the laws to the limit to retrieve vital information. In one particular scene, his character goes nose-to-nose with one of the potential kidnappers, which eventually ends with a needlessly bloody outcome - due to his character's lack of patience.  Clearly, Detective Loki (which feels like an Avengers plug) is the type of detective any parent would want on the street looking for their missing child.While Jake Gyllenhaal is just as much of a main player as Hugh Jackman, he is easily outshined by Jackman's role of the emotionally distraught father.  It's unimaginable how it must feel to have you child kidnapped, but Jackman does a commanding job in the role as he goes through the periods of being fearful, angry, and eventually vengeful - nearly to the fullest extent.  He presses the relevant question, how far would you go as a father to find your kidnapped child?  The emotions flowing through Jackman's character makes for some extremely intense scenes, including a film scene-stealing in which Jackman's character faces off with Gyllenhaal's character outside a liquor store.  Even though Jackman's portrayal is absolutely flawless throughout the course of this mystery flick, this particular scene is a prime example of what drives people to go to movies in the first place.  This is dramatic acting at its absolutely finest.The supporting cast of Prisoners follows the coattails of Jackman and Gyllenhaal closely.  The portrayals by Paul Dano as suspected kidnapper Alex Jones and Terrence Howard as parent Franklin Birch are both noteworthy, but are easily overshadowed and play second fiddle to A-list stars, not to mention the film's captivating storyline - written by Aaron Guzikowski.  Each interaction between the film's characters is better than the last as the film progresses, and as the scenes become tenser, it becomes abundantly clear that Guzikowski's feel for these characters is spot-on.  The writing and dialogue are obviously one of the main contributing factors in the overall success of this film.Overall, Prisoners is gripping, mysterious, and a complete joy to witness, regardless of its traumatic nature.  Hugh Jackman gives the performance of a lifetime, and while it's difficult to say it's the best role of his career, it certainly includes one particular scene that will go down as one of his all-time most memorable moments.  Honestly, there isn't enough praise for the cast of this film, but it really is the plot that makes this such a unique and ambitious film.  And, the best part of this film is the end.  If you think you can see this film's outcome long before it happens, you'll be dead wrong.  You may guess who the ""bad guy"" turns out to be, but the last scene is completely unpredictable.  While the film might not have the most desirable ending for some, it absolutely has the proper ending.  Prisoners should quickly be added to the top of every must-see movie list and is easily one of the most recommended films of the year.

Sisti ""ftt meditator""","[0, 1]","I was looking forward to the movie based on the normal quality of the work by such actors as Jackman but....I assume that the director was adhering to the written screenplay but that was actually the poor choice in the movie's rendition.Normally, if there can ever be a &#34;normality&#34; associated with such a terrible event as a child abduction, the decent into the hell of panic, frustration and hate/revenge by the parents (Jackman, et. al.), would help to raise the clarity of the characters and their own failings and foibles. Not so in this case. Additionally, the characterization of the detective does not &#34;normally&#34; exacerbate the spiraling of the parents.In this case, the writer decided to provide the audience with what I would characterize as &#34;snippets&#34; rather than a cohesive flow. These &#34;snippets&#34; may help pander to the grisliness of the &#34;reflective abduction and torture&#34; of the supposed child abductor and help to hold the audience in a tension centered around the choices we might make between what is right and wrong. However, it was at this point that the movie became tedious because once the characters were in this horrific dilemma the piece goes from &#34;searching&#34; to &#34;revenge&#34; to &#34;sadism&#34; in quick order.Fortunately for writers in hollywood, they can merely construct a way out of the contrived dilemma by making the decision to wreak revenge, the actual right/wrong/right decision flow. This construct then leaves the movie with some needed way to reflect the ultimate karma on Jackman's character by placing him in a &#34;hole&#34; - literally! Moreover, the audience is then left hanging at the end of the movie with the detective looking wistfully into the night wondering why he is hearing a whistle at which time the screen goes to final credits.Way too tedious (centering on the questions of right and wrong), and way too glib (centering on the &#34;superman&#34; capabilities of the abductors and the &#34;foolishness/bumbling&#34; of the everyman parents and detective). The movie production values cast by the dreariness of the Pennsylvania winter-scape does place a &#34;nice&#34; pall on the movie throughout, by-the-way. Having spent many a winter in Pennsylvania I can attest to the dreariness!Child abductions will always be horrific and affected parents will always attempt anything they can in order to find their children but to make them &#34;mock&#34; revengers does a disservice to the real men and women who attempt to rectify real child abduction situations, in my opinion.I finished the movie wondering why Jackman and the rest of the cast allowed themselves to be associated with the screenplay but I suppose money does the talking.",2,Grew Tedious,1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,2740,"['was', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'based', 'normal', 'quality', 'work', 'such', 'actors', 'Jackman', 'assume', 'director', 'was', 'adhering', 'written', 'screenplay', 'was', 'actually', 'poor', 'choice', 'movie', 'rendition.Normally', 'can', 'ever', 'be', '34', 'normality', '34', 'associated', 'terrible', 'event', 'child', 'abduction', 'decent', 'hell', 'panic', 'frustration', 'hate/revenge', 'parents', 'Jackman', 'et', 'al', 'would', 'help', 'raise', 'clarity', 'characters', 'own', 'failings', 'foibles', 'Not', 'so', 'case', 'Additionally', 'characterization', 'detective', 'not', '34', 'normally', '34', 'exacerbate', 'spiraling', 'parents.In', 'case', 'writer', 'decided', 'provide', 'audience', 'what', 'would', 'characterize', '34', 'snippets', '34', 'rather', 'cohesive', 'flow', '34', 'snippets', '34', 'may', 'help', 'pander', 'grisliness', '34', 'reflective', 'abduction', 'torture', '34', 'supposed', 'child', 'abductor', 'help', 'hold', 'audience', 'tension', 'centered', 'choices', 'might', 'make', 'what', 'right', 'wrong', 'However', 'was', 'point', 'movie', 'became', 'tedious', 'characters', 'were', 'horrific', 'piece', '34', 'searching', '34', '34', 'revenge', '34', '34', 'sadism', '34', 'quick', 'order.Fortunately', 'writers', 'hollywood', 'can', 'merely', 'construct', 'way', 'contrived', 'dilemma', 'making', 'decision', 'wreak', 'revenge', 'actual', 'right/wrong/right', 'decision', 'flow', 'construct', 'then', 'movie', 'needed', 'way', 'reflect', 'ultimate', 'karma', 'Jackman', 'character', 'placing', '34', 'hole', '34', 'literally', 'Moreover', 'audience', 'then', 'left', 'hanging', 'end', 'movie', 'detective', 'looking', 'wistfully', 'night', 'wondering', 'why', 'hearing', 'whistle', 'time', 'screen', 'final', 'credits.Way', 'too', 'tedious', 'centering', 'questions', 'right', 'wrong', 'way', 'too', 'glib', 'centering', '34', 'superman', '34', 'capabilities', 'abductors', '34', 'foolishness/bumbling', '34', 'everyman', 'parents', 'detective', 'movie', 'production', 'values', 'cast', 'dreariness', 'Pennsylvania', 'winter-scape', 'place', '34', 'nice', '34', 'pall', 'movie', 'by-the-way', 'Having', 'spent', 'many', 'winter', 'Pennsylvania', 'can', 'attest', 'dreariness', 'Child', 'abductions', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'horrific', 'affected', 'parents', 'will', 'always', 'attempt', 'anything', 'can', 'order', 'find', 'children', 'make', '34', 'mock', '34', 'revengers', 'disservice', 'real', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'attempt', 'rectify', 'real', 'child', 'abduction', 'situations', 'opinion.I', 'finished', 'movie', 'wondering', 'why', 'Jackman', 'rest', 'cast', 'allowed', 'be', 'associated', 'screenplay', 'suppose', 'money', 'talking']",N/A

Though the film is quite long (153 minutes) the tension is sustained making the viewer not so much an observer but a member of this funky little cold town where so much evil happens.The time is the present (the location shooting was Georgia but any small town across the country could well substitute), it is Thanksgiving and two close families are gathered in their neighborhood for the feast; the Dovers - father Keller (Hugh Jackman, mother Grace (Maria Bello), daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) and son Ralph (Dylan Minnette) and the Birches - father Franklin (Terrence Howard), mother Nancy (Viola Davis), daughters Eliza (Zoe Borde) and Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons). Joy and Anna disappear and panic strikes. The only lead is a dilapidated RV that had earlier been parked on their street. Heading the investigation, Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) arrests its driver, Alex Jones (Paul Dano), but a lack of evidence forces his release. As the police pursue multiple leads and pressure mounts, knowing his child's life is at stake the frantic Keller Dover decides he has no choice but to take matters into his own hands. His methods involve capturing and torturing Alex with Franklin's help, but neither is sure of the outcome of their interrogation. Twists and turns occur involving a drunken sicko priest (Len Cariou) and the aunt/mother of Alex (Melissa Leo) - both leading to very surprising endings.The cast is as first rate as they come. Everyone is strong by Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are brilliant. Viola Davis, Melissa Leo, and Maria Bello involve with their usual excellent acting abilities. But in the end credit must go to director Denis Villeneuve for his superb sculpting of this terrifying film. Highly recommended.

While the climax of the movie seems a bit forced, and the attempt by the filmmakers to make the plot like the labyrinth that holds the key to the kidnapped girls' location begins to get a bit tiresome, what sticks with me are the performances.  I've never been a huge fan of Hugh Jackman, but he more than rises to the occasion here as the obsessed father whose own suppressed demons begin to resurface.  It's a terrifying and sensitive performance that finally convinced me of his talent.  Paul Dano, who first caught my attention for his brilliance in &#34;There Will Be Blood,&#34; is pitiable as the mentally challenged young man who seems like the prime suspect.  His torture as the hands of Jackman's character happens mostly off-screen (thankfully), but he remains a sad, lost, sympathetic figure even when he's clearly hiding something.  My favorite performance, though, is Jake Gyllenhaal as the taciturn Det. Loki.  The &#34;defective detective&#34; has become a clich&eacute; in modern procedural drama, but what makes Loki an intriguing character are the qualities only hinted at: the tattoos, the nerdy/hipster clothes and hair, the Freemasons ring, the involuntary blinking especially when stressed.  These all hint at a dark past that is never dragged into the spotlight and add to the character's mystery.  When Loki finally explodes, it's as if he's releasing everything he's repressed since before the events of this movie.  Brilliant acting and super backstory building by Gyllanhaal, who has impressed me since &#34;Donnie Darko.&#34;Unfortunately, other terrific actors get short shrift due to the trio of outstanding performances already mentioned.  Terrance Howard in particular is tragically underserved in his role as Jackman's friend and attempted voice of consciousness.  Viola Davis is onscreen even less, and poor Maria Bello is given almost nothing to do.  With the almost two-and-a-half running time, more insight into the grieving/coping of the mothers could have been powerful, but we don't get to see much of it.

The ending took me completely by surprise, and before we find out who the Big Bad is, there are a number of red herrings thrown in our path.  On my second viewing, I was happy to see that the ending held up, and the clues, which I'd managed to overlook, were there all along.Prisoners is a dark story that covers many unpleasant topics: child abduction, pedophilia, and vigilante justice.  When two young girls disappear, the abductor seems clear: the creepy, mute guy, hanging out in a van nearby.  He's quickly captured by the police, but they don't have enough evidence to hold him.  Hugh Jackman, as one of the fathers, decides to take matters into his own hands.  He kidnaps and tortures the suspect, desperate for information.  Terrence Howard and Viola Davis, playing the parents of the other girl, are a bit more conflicted, but they're reluctant to stand in Jackman's way.

We share the anguish of the parents whose daughters have gone missing and the woman whose nephew is suspected of taking them. At one point I thought I had seen so many MacGuffins I could open a shop, but then, Lo and Behold, each of those little devices became big ones, so pay attention!With a script by Aaron Guzikowski (""Contraband"") and directed by Canadian Denis Villeneuve (""Incendies""), we are wrung out by the frantic action and the heartfelt misery that unfolds before our unwilling eyes. The most outstanding feature is authenticity: The family interactions and the locations. I would have changed some of the dialogue and completely eliminated one ""Gotcha"" moment.Here is the sterling cast:* Hugh Jackman (""Wolverine"") is Keller Dover, a building contractor who lives with his wife and two children in a pleasant middle-class neighborhood. It is his frantic quest to find his daughter that is central to the plot. He says, ""Pray for the best, prepare for the worst.""* Maria Bello (""The Company Men"") is Keller's wife, Grace. As one empty day follows another, she begins to lose hope.* Jake Gyllenhaal (""Source Code"") is Detective Loki, a weary, relentless investigator who hasn't lost a case yet. The girls' parents are frustrated by his unhurried pace.* Viola Davis (""The Help"") is Nancy Birch, mother of the second missing girl. She has to examine her own principles and humanity when confronted by the evidence.* Terrance Howard (""Red Tails"") is her husband Franklin, Keller's unwilling collaborator.* Melissa Leo (""The Fighter"") is Holly Jones, a resourceful widow who has raised her mentally impaired nephew.* Paul Dano (""Ruby Sparks"") is her nephew Alex. He has the mental age of a ten year old.Three things I should mention: 1) This takes place in a chilly, damp locale; take a sweater. 2) This runs 153 minutes; limit your liquids. 3) This is an R-rated thriller; expect explosive action and a LOT of profanity.The DVD will have captions, which I sorely needed a few times.

1323258,AVWU1O6TH3SXG,B0034G4P30,"J. McGinn ""HUNTSMAN""","[0, 0]","Sacrifice is a common theme in Prisoners from the opening scene in the forest Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) recites a prayer while his son Ralph Dover (Dylan Minnette) kills his first deer to the climax where the kidnapper explains that god is the reason why he or she is doing what they are doing and the reasoning behind all the violence her or she has committed, and it both benefits and hurts Prisoners making it a gripping yet an overly long and flawed mystery thriller.As with any good mystery thriller there has to be tension to keep the viewer guessing what will happen next, and suspense as to keep the viewer guessing as whom the murderer is, but first we must take a step back. Keller Dover is down on his luck carpenter whom is struggling, but still able to provide for his family. Keller a deeply spiritual man and his family head to his friend Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) home for Thanksgiving. The two families eat, drink and have fun until their daughters Anna Dover (Erin Gerasimovich) and Joy Birch (Kyla Drew Simmons) head off on their own, and never return to the Birch's home. With the tension rising as the parents call the police and search the neighborhood for the strange RV Ralph had spotted earlier, and this is where Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) makes his appearance when he gets the call about the RV arresting Alex Jones (Paul Dano).The tension and suspense really ratchets up in Prisoners from this point on as Loki and the CSI's find no evidence that Alex took the two girls, and is forced to let Alex go free yet Keller after a confrontation with Alex is sure the man knows where his daughter is and takes matters into his own hand. Director Denis Villeneuve and writer Aaron Guzikowski do a good job keeping up the drama and suspense as they keep hinting that Alex might be the kidnapper yet at the same time throwing in more suspects along the way to keep the viewer guessing until close to the end of the film. Besides the theme of sacrifice another theme Villeneuve and Guzikowski throw in a moral one as well, and try to get the viewer to understand Keller's decisions he has made like how far would you go to find your daughter, what sacrifices would you make to find your daughter, and for the majority of the film director Villeneuve and writer Guzikowiski succeed in doing so.While I really enjoyed Prisoners I had some issues with the story, and the characters as well with the biggest issue being the climax of the film. You wanted to see if the parents were worth of god's love? I know I can't read the minds of serial killers and kidnappers, but the reasoning just didn't match the tone of the film, and where the story was headed. I expected a better thought out payoff than the one I got in Prisoners. Along with the reasoning behind the kidnapping leads to another issue I had with the final act of Prisoners in that the kidnapper could have easily gotten away with it if he or she had just answered the door for Loki. They had plenty of time to hide the evidence, and Loki had no reason or a warrant to search the home. That scene just took me out of what was supposed to be a tension filled scene. Finally there is the scene with Grace Dover (Maria Bello) and detective Loki where she explains that everything her husband did was justified and without him doing what he did Loki wouldn't have found their daughter, which is just crap. I can't believe the writers trying to justify what Keller did forced the character Grace to say that, and I know she's Keller's wife, but Grace can't honestly believe that even if she won't voice it out loud. It was simply laughable moment, because what Keller did was all for nothing. Nothing he did helped find his daughter in fact he was hindering the investigation as Loki had to look into the disappearance of Alex taking time away from searching for the missing children. Director Villeneuve and writer Guzikowiski nearly let everything they achieved in Prisoners fall apart in the final act with plot holes, poorly written dialogue, and out of character decisions made by certain characters. The other problem I had with the Prisoners was the length of the film. The film I watched didn't justify a length of two hours and a half. With some smart editing the film could have been cut down to around two hours and fifteen minutes, and I believe those cuts would have added to the tension and suspense of the film.While the final act of Prisoners faltered the performances by the actors didn't. Hugh Jackman gives his best performance since the Prestige if not his career as Keller. The emotion Jackman gives to Keller brings to life the character and the decisions he has made, and the price Keller has paid making theme. Jake Gyllenhaal also gives an outstanding performance as Detective Loki who has chosen the job over having a family. Gyllenhaal really should stay away from the blockbuster films like Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and the Day After Tomorrow, because Gyllenhall is a far better actor in dramatic roles than action roles as he has proven in Donnie Darko, End of Watch, and Brokeback Mountain. Maria Bello doesn't have much to do in Prisoners as the distraught Grace Dover, but she gives a believable performance as a mother who has lost her daughter cutting herself off from the outside world. Like Mario Bello, Terrence Howard doesn't have much to do in his role as Franklin Birch as he is relegated to Keller's accomplice, but the experienced actor Howard gives his all in the role displaying the conflicting emotions when is morality is tested as he helps Keller in his quest to find their daughters.If not for the faulty final act, and climax Prisoners would go down as one of the great mystery thrillers like Memento, The Silence of the Lambs, and L.A. Confidential, but even with its flaws Prisoners is a riveting engrossing thriller with a quality moral story that will keep you guessing nearly to the end, outstanding performances by Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, and the rest of the cast that helps to turn Prisoners into enthralling, nerve-racking and thoughtful thriller, and one of the better films of the year.",4,Prisoners is a masterful

1323267,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B0034G4P30,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[1, 2]","***This review may contain spoilers***The movie ""Prisoners"" simply starts with two families, the Dovers and the Birches, in a nondescript, blue-collar town, sharing a Thanksgiving dinner.  Then the two youngest members of both families, Anna Dover (Erin Gerasimovich) and Joy Birch (Kyla Drew Simmons) go to play outside supposedly under Anna's older brother Ralph's supervision.  They get close to a next-door neighbor's RV, but quickly leave when a pair of ominous eyes stare at them from inside.  Soon after, both nine-year old girls are missing and apparently kidnapped.  Methodical, persistent Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), with a perfect case-solving record, strives to find out who abducted the children and why.  There are a few suspects, but the most prominent one is Alex Jones (Paul Dano), a child-like young man who lives with caretaker aunt Holly (Melissa Leo) and who is arrested after violently trying to flee Loki and the police in the same RV. So now it's simply a matter of getting Alex to confess to the crime and reveal where the two girls are - isn't it?Perhaps it's not so simple.  ""Prisoners"" spins an elaborate, deliberate, and intelligent mystery with its share of clues, red herrings, and frustrating dead ends.  But I believe the movie's primary focus IS reflected in its nuanced title and how the characters react to it.  Both families, including Grace Dover (Maria Bello), Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard), and Nancy Birch (Viola Davis) are understandably psychologically imprisoned by anxiety, suspense, tension, and horror at their loss - almost to the point of inertia.  However, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) is not so passive.  He is imprisoned by more than just fear; he seethes with vengeance and wrath.  He is not satisfied with what he sees as cursory treatment of primary suspect Alex by Loki and the police and is enraged by Alex's release from custody due to insufficient evidence.  Insufficient evidence, hell! Keller, a home renovator, has his own ways of making Alex talk...As the mystery progresses, ""Prisoners"" takes the time to explore Keller's struggle between justice and revenge and the viewer's attitude toward his actions.  As Keller retaliates with his own kidnapping and subsequent torture of Alex, I think many viewers will simultaneously sympathize with and be repelled by Keller's behavior.  If we lost a child, of course many of us would rage, and swear, and be spurred to some kind of action.  But would we do the things Keller does to Alex, things that begin to border on the sadistic?  As it winds toward the kidnapping resolution, the revelation of the culprit, Alex's fate, and, surprisingly, Keller's ironic fate,  ""Prisoners"" reminds us that no situation, even a kidnapping and possible torture, justifies letting ourselves being imprisoned by mindless and perhaps misguided vengeance.  In this regard, Detective Loki provides contrast.

Prisoners is one such film. The movie focuses on two families whose daughters disappear on Thanksgiving day, and the subsequent search for them. Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), the father of one of the little girls, takes matters into his own hands when the police fail to make any progress in the search. He becomes more and more rash and irrational, his methods more and more extreme. This is not Taken with Liam Neeson. This is a man who prepares for every situation and disaster, and loses it when he's faced with a crisis he never thought to prepare for. Hugh Jackman's Keller is frantic, angry and above all, desperate. His is a loud, red hot, full blooded performance that fully conveys the sense of anguish, rage, and fear that someone in his position would endure. The film asks the audience to consider how far is too far when it comes to your children's well-being. What would you do? Jake Gyllenhaal, in an interesting turn, plays the detective assigned to the case. Where Jackman's performance is showy (in a good way), Gyllenhaal turns in a layered, subtly nuanced performance. He is the long-suffering force that everyone in the film turns to for help, as well as to lay blame. But my favorite part of the movie is the cinematography. Its gorgeous. Every frame of the film is considered and precise. It is one of the most well filmed movies I've ever seen. It looks incredible on bluray, and I sometimes put the film in just to see some of the beautiful photography in it.With intricate and engaging writing, intentional editing, arresting cinematography and powerful performances, I can't for the life of me figure out how this film flew under the radar this Oscar season. But either way, this is a thrilling and powerful piece of cinema. It has its issues, mostly concerning some possible plotholes and a line or two of only passable dialogue, but the film is so engrossing that they are easy to overlook, and even easier to forgive. At the end of the day, this is a layered and intense near- masterpiece.

Prisoners is a good, maybe even great movie. It is a 2 hour + movie, but I guarantee you will not get bored watching this film. Every emotion, whether it be anxiety, loneliness, hope, and even sadness, you feel it with each character in the movie. That is mainly due to the acting, but also to the intensity of the story. Time does not feel like a factor watching the movie. Because in the end, everyone wants the same outcome.As a whole, Prisoners scores high due to the Intense acting by both main/supporting actors. It succeeds even better with the emotional, drama-ridden storytelling that it brings to the table. Oscar buzz has been around Hugh Jackman's name as of late, and I gotta say rightfully so. The fearlessness and determination is unlike anything I've seen not just this year in in a movie, but in quite a while. I will definitely buy Prisoners on dvd.

1323281,AJNW2SVETWAW1,B0034G4P30,kacunnin,"[10, 15]","PRISONERS, Denis Villeneuveis's gritty thriller about the kidnapping of two young girls in suburban Pennsylvania, is definitely compelling.  But it's also totally over-the-top and laden with ridiculous coincidences that defy credibility.  The screenplay, by Aaron Guzikowski (CONTRABAND), gives us a number of interesting characters, including harried police detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), who is called in to investigate the disappearance of two girls on Thanksgiving Day.  The father of one of the girls, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), goes from being cooperative with the police to full-on vigilante after the prime suspect -- Alex Jones (Paul Dano), a disturbed young man whose RV was seen parked in the Dovers' neighborhood - is released for lack of evidence.  Dover's wife Grace (Maria Bello) spends most of the movie in a semi-catatonic state, waiting for word of her missing child.  And the other girl's parents, Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrance Howard and Viola Davis), are little more than background characters.  So what we get is two-and-a-half hours of unrelenting tension as Loki tries to unravel the case and Dover goes abu ghraib on hapless Jones.  How far is it permissible to go to save a child?  And are we all prisoners, trapped by circumstances beyond our control into behaving in ways that destroy us?The biggest problem with the film, aside from its over-the-top sensationalism, is the number of coincidences that confound credibility.  [SPOILERS AHEAD -- proceed with caution!] Loki questions a priest who's on the sex offender list, and he finds a decomposed body in the basement.  Then there's a guy in a hoodie seen lurking around a candlelight vigil for the missing girls, and then later sneaking into their houses - turns out he's obsessed with mazes and has a thing for snakes and kids' clothes.  Loki also interviews the mother of a young boy who was kidnapped decades earlier under similar circumstances, a cute little boy seen riding his bike in videos.  Prime suspect Jones, who's described as having the IQ of a ten-year-old, lives with his aunt, whose husband disappeared five years before and hasn't been seen since.  All of these seemingly random events are ultimately connected like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle, fitting together to create an insidious picture of a world gone mad.  It's beyond soap opera, beyond anything that could pass for possible, and it undermines whatever impact the film ultimately delivers - or doesn't.There are definitely hints in PRISONERS of other films with similar themes, like THE VANISHING (1993), A SIMPLE PLAN (1998), IN THE BEDROOM (2001), and MYSTIC RIVER (2003).  In all of them, there are kidnappings, misunderstandings, vigilante actions, and twisted endings.  Innocent people die in these films, and ostensibly good people do very bad things.  The point of MYSTIC RIVER seems to be that when we play vigilante, even with the best of motives, we become the monsters we seek to destroy.  PRISONERS never goes quite that far, as if Guzikowski and Villeneuveis aren't quite willing to take a stand on the horror they splash across the screen.  Is Jackman's Keller Dover a monster of his own making, or just a father doing everything he can to find his missing daughter?  In other words, is he channeling Liam Neeson from TAKEN (2008), or Sean Penn from MYSTIC RIVER?  Because it makes a difference, and those are two very different film.I wish I had liked PRISONERS more, since it's one of the few films released this year that isn't about superheroes, comic books, or boob jokes.  For that reason alone, I hope it does well enough to encourage studios to continue producing adult films with intelligent scripts.  But I also wish the script were a bit more intelligent and a bit less sensational.  This isn't a bad film so much as a disappointing one.  With a cast like that it should have been amazing.  It isn't.  And that's a shame.  Watch it for the performances, for the bleak and unrelenting setting, and for the level of tension that never relents.  But be prepared for loose ends, over-the-top behavior (especially from Jackman's character), and enough coincidences to make the whole thing seem ultimately ridiculous.  It's worth talking about, though, and that's a good thing.

You'll have to find your own way to learn how the movie ends.I like really good suspense movies. &#34;Prisoners&#34; looked dark enough. Good cast, decent ratings, what could go wrong?&#34;Prisoners&#34; serves up plenty of suspense. It's got a good storyline, if you can follow it ... or stay awake while it meanders down a long and twisted path. It's about madness and mayhem, saints and sinners, the lost and forgotten, the found and forgiven, Nearly each character is a whack job. And Hugh Jackman can really scream in bass.I'm often disappointed when a movie I want to see is a mere 90 min. I feel cheated. That won't happen again. With &#34;Prisoners,&#34; I got what I longed for - a story with some meat behind it. Two and a half hours worth. Yeah!

Near the end, I stopped caring if the children were dead or alive. I just wanted to put a cap on it. When the denouement comes, you'll wake up awash with an emotion: anger. You'll want to kill the screenwriter, the producers, the actors. Ultimately, we are its last victim as the ending we so waited for washes away like a bad roll in the sack, unsatisfied.I can't recommend it.

Heading the investigation, Detective Loki arrests its driver, Alex Jones, but a lack of evidence forces his release.

I had only known it was some sort of revenge thriller involving a kidnapping. So while that is a sparse summary of the plot, it fails to capture the magnitude, gravitas, and power of this film.This movie is not so easy to watch. From the actors' many fine performances to its somber tone, there is a heavy and real sense of dread that is likely off-putting for more sensitive viewers. You may have seen hundreds of films and shows where the heroes' lives are in peril, but they are all so cozy and trite by comparison. This film is the very rare exception where you become truly immersed in the story and empathize with its various gut-wrenching emotions of fear, doubt, sanity and rage. I honestly can't remember the last time I cared so much about a group of characters. From the outset, it's obvious that this is a serious and adult movie, one where nobody is safe, and a happy ending is hardly guaranteed after so many clever turns in the story. There is a darkness throughout even the heroes which can qualify the film as a neo-noir, despite its gloomy Northern country setting.There are many other superb elements to this movie beyond its engaging plot. The film looks absolutely amazing thanks to multi-Oscar-nominated cinematographer Roger Deakins, who's also shot Shawshank and a half-dozen of the Coen brothers' films. The score is perfectly simple but wonderful. The actors all give astoundingly heartfelt performances too.If you can handle this movie's intensity, it will haunt you with its elegance.

The script was suspenseful [ I actually had to close my eyes during some frightening parts] and had some nice twists and turns.Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as the policeman, Loki,  was wonderful. His background was just hinted at, a youth spent at a boys' home, but his lack of affect, impenetrable solitude and street tattoos spoke volumes. Viola Davis, Terrence Howard and Maria Bello were fine though a bit underutilized in smaller roles, and Paul Dano was credible as the suspect in a Thanksgiving kidnapping.However, the character played by Hugh Jackman was so cliched and over the top, that for me, the movie was marred by it [and  I am  a Northern urban dweller, neither Christian nor right wing].  One the one hand, I'm happy the otherwise talented screenwriter broke through to the big time and is now living his dream, on the other, his depiction of  a ' redneck ' father who becomes a vigilante and takes justice into his own hands is stereotypically New York/ Hollywoodish : a snarling, deer hunting survivalist upholder of the second amendment, who is drunk, violent and prays before committing heinous acts.The motivation for the latter day gun toting Bloody Mama - waging a war on God to make parents lose their faith is fairly absurd [ generally people who kidnap and kill children have far more heinous motivations]  and the dog torturing intellectually disabled suspect is named Alex Jones, like the conspiracy mongering talk show host,  which should give you a clue where the scriptwriter is coming from.Consequently, the movie, which was set up as a moral examination of the events depicted, falls short of that goal and becomes more of a twisty -turn scare fest.

1323322,A129YBX5BVNW2,B0034G4P30,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[4, 5]","Young parents Keller and Grace Dover walk over to the suburban home of Franklin and Nancy Birch in the November cold for a Thanksgiving Dinner involving neighbours, laughter and bad trumpet playing (Hugh Jackman, Maria Bello, Terence Howard and Viola Davis). Their respective daughters of 7 and 6 Anna and Eliza happily play upstairs with a pet while the adults below drink and reminisce. That is until both children go outside to play - and unaccompanied - addle up to the back of a muddied RV parked suspiciously by the kerb in broad daylight...Although I thoroughly despise material that uses children being hurt as entertainment - ""Prisoners"" beats the pants off so many supposed thrillers because it reeks of intelligence (a fantastic and clever script) and has a cast that emotionally rivets you to the screen every second they're up there. It's also prepared to be silent - ordinary even - thereby making some scenes disturbingly close to how real life actually is. It's unnerving, creepy and stomach churning in places too (there are monsters out there).In order for this to work you need major league actors - and lots of them - and right down to a repentant Paedophile Priest - even the small parts are perfectly cast. Hugh Jackman plays Keller Dover - a redecorator/builder and a 'prepare for the worst' deer-shooting survivalist - while his wife Grace believes she'll and her family will be 'safe' with him. Mild-mannered neighbours and friends Franklin and Nancy Birch have the opposite dynamic - the wife is the boss while her husband is more reflective.  But when a local simpleton Alex Jones is found singing in the front seat of the squalid RV and arrested but won't talk - both sets of parents have their patience and nerves tested. Frustrated by the cops lack of progress and working to the letter of the law - and with the days passing and time running out for their abducted daughters - Alpha Male Keller decides to take matters into his own hands...Into this emotional cauldron comes Detective Loki who's solved every case he's ever been given. He may at times seem too detached from the parent's pain and rage - but he's a man who spots things and sees through the lies in people (a mesmerizing Jake Gyllenhaal). Obsessive yet law-abiding - he instinctively feels that spaced out Alex Jones who can't say much but can still drive an RV easily - is lying - sickly concealing the whereabouts of the girls and enjoying the cat and mouse game too (an Oscar performance yet again from Paul Dano - the preacher in ""There Will Be Blood""). But is he? And what about his heart-broken mother (subtle brilliance from Melissa Leo) who has defended this social outcast all her life - despite her religion-obsessed husband leaving years back and abandoning them both. Keller even goes after her. In the meantime Grace Dover (a ragged looking Maria Bello) simply breaks at the enormity of her child being lost - while the stoical Nancy folds her arms, grits her teeth and reconciles herself to what both fathers must do - go over demarcation lines you really shouldn't cross...The genius of Aaron Guzikowski's script and Dennis Villeneuve's Direction is that one whole hour in - and you're absolutely none the wiser as to who is the bad guy and who isn't. And it has to be said that some of the violence is horrible and cringing. But what keeps you watching is the sheer visceral power of the actors. The dance between Jackman and Gyllenhaal is fantastic cinema - both men barely holding on to any humanity or faith as the frustration mounts and suspicions arise (exactly the sick kind of mental torture the abductor wants to inflict on them). And you also sit there questioning just how far a determined parent would go to get their child back (abusing a man who may or may not be an innocent).Special mention has to be made of the picture quality of the BLU RAY. Defaulted to Full Aspect (which fills up the whole screen) - ""Prisoners"" is starkly gorgeous and truly beautiful throughout. Often without any music - the blunt and stainless steel cold angles ratchet up the tension to unbearable levels (fear of what is happening to the children). It's the Cinematography genius of ROGER DEAKINS (""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""True Grit""). Scene after scene is filled with it: casing a house in the pouring rain at night - Jones walking his dog as Keller spies on him from a nearby truck - the decaying body tied to a chair in the basement of a suspect's house - Detective Loki interviewing a sex offender you can't see behind a filthy pane of glass - Loki's tired bulging eyes and unkempt stubble (hasn't slept for days) as he leans forward into a computer monitor scouring the screen for any detail that will help - closing in on the jagged bark of a tree... The framing of everything is the unsung hero of the movie - adding unbelievable depth and genuine unease that serves right up until the superb and clever ending.There are two Extras - the short ""Every Moment Counts"" and the more extensive ""Powerful Performers"" which features enthusiastic interviews with all the principal actors, Director Dennis Villeneuve and Producers Kara Davis and Broderick Johnson. But don't watch ""Powerful Performers"" before you watch the movie - it rather clumsily gives away far too much in terms of the twisting plot.The brilliant and unsettling ""Prisoners"" had my wife and I on the edge of our seats unable to press the pause button to desperately go to the loo. Now that's how you put the 'thrill' in thriller.Job done I'd say...",5,"""...He Knows Where They Are!"" - Prisoners on BLU RAY",1397001600,"04 9, 2014",2014,5530,"['Young', 'parents', 'Keller',

1323324,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B0034G4P30,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[1, 1]","Prisoners is a compelling drama/thriller about two families that are forced to deal with the loss of their young daughters. When the girls go missing over the course of a seemingly normal afternoon, multiple lives are thrown into chaos in the ensuing struggle not just to find the children but also to deal with the cold reality of a world where things like this usually only happen to other people.The plot of the movie is deceptively straightforward, but the performances and the underlying message of the film are so thickly layered that the film is a deeply engaging experience, in spite of the harsh, disturbing story it tells. This is probably the best acting I've ever seen from either Jackman or Gyllenhaal, not to mention the rest of the cast, including the remarkably talented Paul Dano as the movie's primary suspect in the kidnapping.For a movie that has so much going on under the surface, there's very little that can be said about it without marring the amazing depth and complexity that it sets up in so many of the characters. Suffice it to say that, by the film's final moment, the title seems to have half a dozen different interpretations, the movie less about what it takes to get justice or right wrongs than it is about the many ways people can find themselves trapped by their own hearts, minds, or actions. Although the movie doesn't have a lot of action in the traditional sense, there is a whole world of turmoil and energy boiling beneath the paper-thin layers of nearly every character, even when they're just sitting and staring into space.The best example of a movie that takes silence and stasis and turns into something that is nearly impossible to ignore, PRISONERS is one of the best dramas I've seen in a long time, and not the least because it makes absence and doubt into something so riveting and tumultuous.",5,Best Drama of the Year,1386720000,"12 11, 2013",2013,1847,"['Prisoners', 'compelling', 'drama/thriller', 'two', 'families', 'are', 'forced', 'deal', 'loss', 'young', 'daughters', 'When', 'girls', 'go', 'missing', 'course', 'seemingly', 'normal', 'afternoon', 'multiple', 'lives', 'are', 'thrown', 'chaos', 'ensuing', 'struggle', 'not', 'just', 'find', 'children', 'also', 'deal', 'cold', 'reality', 'world', 'where', 'things', 'usually', 'only', 'happen', 'other', 'people.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'deceptively', 'straightforward', 'performances', 'underlying', 'message', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'thickly', 'layered', 'film', 'deeply', 'engaging', 'experience', 'spite', 'harsh', 'disturbing', 'story', 'probably', 'best', 'acting', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Jackman', 'Gyllenhaal', 'not', 'mention', 'rest', 'cast', 'including', 'remarkably', 'talented', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'movie', 'primary', 'suspect', 'kidnapping.For', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'surface', 'very', 'little', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'marring', 'amazing', 'depth', 'complexity', 'up', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'Suffice', 'say', 'film', 'final', 'moment', 'title', 'have', 'dozen', 'different', 'interpretations', 'movie', 'less', 'what', 'get', 'justice', 'right', 'wrongs', 'many', 'ways', 'people', 'can', 'find', 'trapped', 'own', 'hearts', 'minds', 'actions', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'action', 'traditional', 'sense', 'whole', 'world', 'turmoil', 'energy', 'boiling', 'paper-thin', 'layers', 'nearly', 'character', 'even', 'when', ""'re"", 'just', 'sitting', 'staring', 'space.The', 'best', 'example', 'movie', 'silence', 'stasis', 'something', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'ignore', 'PRISONERS', 'one', 'best', 'dramas', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'not', 'least', 'absence', 'doubt', 'something', 'so', 'riveting', 'tumultuous']",N/A

It takes the most terrifying idea that a parent has, your child being abducted, and tosses it about in a fashion unseen before on screen. Is that a good thing? Yes.The film opens with two families living in the same neighborhood getting together for Thanksgiving. One is Keller and Grace Dover (Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello), the other Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terence Howard and Viola Davis). After dinner the Dover's daughter wants to run home with the Birch's daughter to look for a whistle she can't find. Terror soon follows.The two girls can't be found and the older kids they were supposed to ask go with them never knew that they left. From an earlier walk Dover's son remembered an RV parked down the road that his sister tried to climb. A manhunt follows with everyone searching for the girls and that RV.As it so happens Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhall) gets the call about a sighting of the RV. He gets to the scene only to have the driver speed into a tree and then be captured. What they find is a young man named Alex Jones (Paul Dano) with some mental issues who either can't or won't answer their questions. Keller can't believe the police are as helpless as he is when it comes to finding answers and holds them accountable.The search continues and eventually Jones is released. Keller confronts him in the parking lot and Jones whispers something to him that makes Keller believe he knows what happened to the girls. Intent on finding his daughter, even if the police have their hands tied with legalities, Keller kidnaps Jones and takes him to an abandoned apartment building he owns. With the reluctant help of Franklin he systematically tortures Jones to get information. It's brutal but not over done considering what's on the screen these days.As Keller seeks information his way Det. Loki follows clues of his own. With a record of solving every case he's been assigned he doggedly pursues each lead that comes his way. Some go nowhere but a few turn up a suspect other than Jones, one who turns up at a candle light vigil for the two girls and who escapes Loki when he pursues him on foot. This doesn't stop him from continuing his search as well as his looking at Keller as a possible suspect as well.Do they find the girls? Are they still alive? And just who really kidnapped them if anyone? If you want to know what happens rent or buy the movie, don't expect me to give it away. The twists and turns in this plot bounce back and forth more than Mullholland Drive if it were ice covered and foggy. The movie does a great job of making you think one way then convincing you that you should look another only to toss in a third concept before making you think you were right to begin with. Got that? Well that's the sort of back and forth I'm talking about. In the end everything fits in place and the result is an ending that makes sense. I won't say you'll be happy with it, but it makes sense.As seems to be the case with many films these days there isn't a bad performance on screen here. Jackman and Gyllenhall take center stage when it comes to outstanding performances, both exercising their acting muscles by playing parts different than we've seen them in before. Howard is given far too small a part to play here but does it well. Bello and Davis feel more like supporting roles than leads here and that's a shame. Dano once more plays that misunderstood character and does a fine job.Don't let the 153 minute length scare you away. Time flies when you're watching this one and there isn't a boring moment. And when you get to the last 30-40 minutes you'll be wringing your hands waiting to see what happens next.

1323331,A205C7VCSDVARI,B0034G4P30,Meatwad,"[0, 0]","Director: Denis Villeneuve.Writer: Aaron Guzikowski.Staring: Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Viola Davis, Terrence Howard, Maria Bello, Melissa Leo and David Dastmalchian.Running Time: 153 minutes.Rating: R for Disturbing Violent Content including Torture, and Language throughout.Let's get this right out of the way for Prisoners: It is not a happy a movie. If you're expecting a good time or to come out with a smile on your face, this is not your type of movie. You would be much better off popping in something like Pacific Rim or seeing if Frozen is still playing where you live. But even if a film is horribly depressing, that doesn't mean you shouldn't watch it if given the chance. Far from it with something like Prisoners, the English language debut of Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (Incendies). While its grueling content and odd plot points may cause some contention with viewers, Prisoners delivers on damn near every cylinder you should expect to see in a good mystery: Excellent performances, a plot that keeps you guessing till the very end, haunting cinematography and some interesting debates on morality and what one would do and how far they would go to save a loved one.One day, somewhere in Pennsylvania, a small get together with two families is going on. Set sometime around Thanksgiving, the two families The Dovers (Hugh Jackman playing Keller and Maria Bello playing Grace) and The Birches (Viola Davis playing Nacy and Terrence Howard playing Franklin) are having a nice get together. Everybody's laughing, chowing down tasty food, just having a good time together. The teens hang out while the youngsters, Anna Dover and Joy Birch, are off playing around in the neighborhood.A few hours latter, the two youngest disappear. An investigation is soon kicked into motion and headed by Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) to find out who it is Eventually, the find a suspect in the form of mentally handicapped Alex Jones (Paul Dano). But due to the fact there is a lack of evidence on whether he did it or not, he winds up being released. The father of one of the families, Keller Dover, however, becomes increasingly unstable over the course of the investigation, resorting to his own (brutal) methods to find out if Alex actually did it or not.So yes, as one can tell from that synopsis up top, Prisoners isn't what one would call a ""feel good movie"". On top of that, it isn't one that goes by quick. It fully expects you to sit down and watch as it takes you on a long journey of what its like to have a child taken from you. Whether you have or haven't had kids, you feel steeped in the misery and horror of what the parents go through in the film. Hell, the film was originally slapped with an NC-17 rating before it got re-edited with a R. Frankly, after watching the film itself, it doesn't surprise me that it almost got the former.Another interesting note to make is that in addition to being a Drama-Mystery-Thriller, the film is also a play on morality. Most of the characters never stay clean for long, especially High Jackman's character, who pulls some especially dickish things to find his kid. As seen in the trailers (don't worry; this all happens in the first half hour), he winds up kidnapping Alex to find out where the children are, but what he does will make your stomach churn. Even as the film went as on, I found myself conflicted with his character, wanting him to find his kids but I wished he'd stop being such an ass in trying to find his kid. The film itself and its characters are even asking themselves if what they're doing is justified or not.What I found interesting about the film is that you never really know who's who or what till the end. For the majority of the film's running time, it keeps you guessing on whether Alex did it or not. Is he playing stupid? Does he genuinely not know what happened to the kids? Was he manipulated into doing what he did? It's like being in a maze, a nightmarish labyrinth from where there is no escape from until the very end.The film's performances are uniformly excellent, with Hugh Jackman showing us a scary side of his acting abilities that we haven't seen before. His character shows a broad range of anger, ruthlessness and regret. The performance as Dover is so good, it outright makes his iconic Wolverine role look downright pathetic by comparison. I can also safely say that thanks to this role, Jackman's was able to partially redeem himself after being in last year's blunderpiece Movie 43. He's not quite there yet, but I hold him in much higher regard than I did after 43. The rest of the supporting cast also give great performances as well. Jake Gyllenhaal continues to be one of the best actors working today, with an almost equally compelling side role as the determined Detective Loki. One scene in particular that stands out for me with him is when flips out in his office. I won't say what happens in regards to that part in what triggers him, but damn, he really lost it in a big way.Terrence Howard and Paul Dano bring their goods to the table as well, as does Maria Bello and Viola Davis. Melissa Leo also shows up as Alex Jones' mother, Holly, and while she doesn't have that many scenes in the film, she is compelling enough to keep an admirable presence on-screen. Even the kids who play Joy and Anna (Kyla Drew Simmons and Erin Gerasimovich, respectively) do their roles without some kind of saccharine or sickly-sweet kind of way that one would usually expect from kids in movies.Shot by famous cinematographer Roger Deakins (Skyfall, No Country For Old Men, The Shawshank Redemption), Prisoners looks unsurprisingly beautiful in its imagery. Damn near every frame looks downright perfect, with scenes that look like they were molded by a paint brush than a camera. Denis and Deakins obviously know what they're doing, and I hope that they collaborate more in the future. Then there's the score by J&oacute;hann J&oacute;hannsson, who achieves haunting yet minimalist work that help establish the mood of the picture quite excellently.If there were any problems I had with the film, I'd say it would be some plot elements. There's something that happens to Paul Dano's character in which he ends up disappearing from the public eye and it doesn't really get addressed until the last 30 minutes of the movie. Arguably, due to the investigation of the girls, I can see how their disappearance could be held in higher regard than Dano's but it was still a little something that bothered me.Then there's how the film handles its clues, foreshadowing and red-herrings, in which it maybe just a little too clever for its own good. It's great to see a film keep its audience guessing all the way through and then pull the rug under their feet when they least expect it, but it felt like the movie was getting a little overly complicated. Not that it was a major hindrance to the film's quality, but I can see how some would be fed up with the plot twists and the loopty loops the film pulls from time to time.It's a shame that the film was missed at the Oscar season. It was a big contender in the first couple of weeks it came out but due to being swarmed by a mountain of other films (Gravity, 12 Years A Slave, The Wolf of Wall Street), it sadly got overlooked and wound up with only a nom for Best Cinematography. Yet, in spite of that, its more than worth checking out. Its imagery, performances and plot won't leave you for a while and it will keep you engaged all the way through its long running time.",5,Hugh Who Fights With Monsters,1390608000,"01 25,

He made a conservative Christian survivalist a sympathetic character - not the easiest job in this culture.Jake Gyllenhaal is so interesting. The older he gets the better he gets. There was clearly a huge back story to the cop he played and it was used skillfully to add to the present movie not distract from it. From the tattoos to the facial ticks, this mat be his best acting job ever.I love it when actors get their teeth in and really master a character to the point that we BELIEVE everything that is happening on screen.

I was scared that I was going to have to watch her version of bullish post feminism that she brings to nearly every role she plays.

1323343,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,B0034G4P30,mitchell5954,"[1, 2]","Prisoners is yet another installment in the crime/abduction movie genre starring Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal.  Prisoners is not really my type of movie.  I&#8217;m not generally into crime dramas whether it be crime/abduction movies or the few dozen crime dramas on television like CSI, Criminal Minds, NCIS, Law and Order, etc.  I would not have seen this film had it not have starred Hugh Jackman or Jake Gyllenhaal.I am a big fan of Hugh Jackman.  He is the perfect Wolverine.  No one could have played Wolverine better.  I have also seen many of his other films as well like the Fountain, Les Miserable, Real Steel, etc.  While some of his movies I do not care for like the Fountain, I still loved his performance in them.  He is a very talented actor and deserves an Oscar at this point.  Hopefully he gets one for his performance in this film.  I also like Gyllenhaal as an actor.  I thought he was good in the Day After Tomorrow and I thought he was great in Zodiac.  Without these two this movie would not have been as good.  They were both amazing in this film.I knew the film would at least be decent because those two actors were in it and the film is getting pretty good reviews so far on Rotten Tomatoes.  I saw the film and I liked it.  I will say that out of all the crime drama films that I have seen I would that this is one of the better ones.  It is well acted by everyone in the cast, not just by Jackman and Gyllenhaal.  The story was also good and fairly well executed.  I will also admit that this film does something a little bit different than most crime dramas that I have seen.The story is fairly simple.  It is very much like it was advertised in the trailers.  You have two families.  One family consists of a man named Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), his wife Gracie Dover (Maria Bello), his son Ralph, and his daughter Anna.  The other family consists of a man named Franklin (Terrence Howard), his wife Nancy (Viola Davis), his eldest daughter Eliza, and the youngest daughter Joy.  The two children, Anna and Joy, end up being abducted by an unknown individual.  An investigator named Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) to investigate the case.  They have the primary suspect named Alex in custody.  However, they cannot find anything on him and release him.  Dover obsessed with getting his daughter back and takes the law into his own hands.The movie is very good, but it is not a movie that can be watched casually.  It is very depressing and does not end the best.  The characters do some pretty messed up things that make you like them less, but you do see where they are coming from.  This movie is very much like films like the Departed, Seven, Gone Baby Gone, Mystic River, etc.  They are well-done films, but they leave you depressed and are not films you can really re-watch.  I do like prisoners more than most of those films though.This film at least did not have an entirely depressing ending.  It is not really a happy ending, but more bittersweet.  To be honest that is really the only way this movie could have ended though.  I usually prefer triumphant endings, but this one could not really end happily.  From what occurs in the movie and certain actions the main character takes, if the film ended happily it would have felt like a cop out.Overall, Prisoners is a well-done crime drama.  I will say that this, Zodiac, and The Dark Knight (yes I count it as a crime drama) are my favorite films in this particular genre.  It is well-acted well plotted and well executed.

There may be spoilers.Director Denis Villeneuve (""Incendies"") asks the question, ""What would you do if your child disappears?""  Hugh Jackman takes his Wolverine and Jean Valjean character's anger to a new level in this horrifying film.  He plays Keller Dover, a middle class Pennsylvanian who does work renovating houses.  His wife, Grace (Maria Bello) is a perfect companion.  Together they have 2 children.  Six year old Anna and teenage Ralph (Dylan Minnette).  They are having dinner at their neighbor and best friend's house.  Viola Davis and Terrence Howard are Nancy and Franklin Birch who have similar aged kids.  Young Eliza and teen daughter, Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons).After dinner, the two younger kids want to go back to the Dover house to retrieve a doll or something.  Nobody's paying much attention until everyone realizes they never came back.  The search is on and after checking the neighborhood, the police are called.  Jake Gyllenhaal plays Detective Loki who heads up the search.  The police quickly track down a suspect who had been mysteriously parked in front of a vacant house in the neighborhood.  Alex Jones (Paul Dano) is the prime suspect, but he isn't talking.  Primarily because he has the mind of a 10 year old.  In addition, his RV that the girls had been playing on earlier, produced no evidence that the girls were ever there.The two families, Keller in particular, are convinced that Jones knows where the girls are and are frustrated that he is released by the police.  As days past, Loki follows other clues while still focusing on Jones.  This doesn't satisfy Keller who eventually takes matters into his own hands and kidnaps Jones, holding him captive in an old apartment building he owns.  Villeneuve doesn't hold back as Keller beats Jones to a bloody pulp, later moving him to a small closet for some old fashion water torture.  While all this is going on, Loki finds another suspect unbeknownst to Keller.  So is Jones innocent after all?Melissa Leo plays Holly Jones, Alex's adoptive aunt.  She's critical to the investigation, providing background to Alex's upbringing.  Her own background is a bit of a mystery, but both Loki and Keller continue to probe.  This movie is difficult to watch, not only because of the subject matter and torture scenes, but because it makes the viewer realize that there is an inner animal in all of us.  The writing is excellent, the cinematography is superb.  Strong performances by all but especially Jackman as Keller and Davis in her supporting role.  Dark and foreboding but a strong piece of filmmaking that will keep you talking well after the final credits roll.",4,4 1/2 stars:  Dark and foreboding but a strong piece of filmmaking,1379894400,"09 23, 2013",2013,2667,"['Theatrical', 'Review', 'may', 'be', 'spoilers.Director', 'Denis', 'Villeneuve', 'Incendies', 'question', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'child', 'disappears', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Wolverine', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'character', 'anger', 'new', 'level', 'horrifying', 'film', 'Keller', 'Dover', 'middle', 'class', 'Pennsylvanian', 'who', 'work', 'renovating', 'houses', 'wife', 'Grace', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'perfect', 'companion', 'Together', 'have', '2', 'children', 'Six', 'year', 'old', 'Anna', 'teenage', 'Ralph', 'Dylan', 'Minnette', 'are', 'having', 'dinner', 'neighbor', 'best', 'friend', 'house', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'are', 'Nancy', 'Franklin', 'Birch', 'who', 'have', 'similar', 'aged', 'kids', 'Young', 'Eliza', 'teen', 'daughter', 'Joy', 'Kyla', 'Drew', 'Simmons', '.After', 'dinner', 'two', 'younger', 'kids', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'Dover', 'house', 'retrieve', 'doll', 'something', 'Nobody', 'paying', 'much', 'attention', 'everyone', 'never', 'came', 'back', 'search', 'checking', 'neighborhood', 'police', 'are', 'called', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Detective', 'Loki', 'who', 'up', 'search', 'police', 'quickly', 'track', 'down', 'suspect', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'mysteriously', 'parked', 'front', 'vacant', 'house', 'neighborhood', 'Alex', 'Jones', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'prime', 'suspect', ""n't"", 'talking', 'Primarily', 'mind', '10', 'year', 'old', 'addition', 'RV', 'girls', 'had', 'been', 'playing', 'earlier', 'produced', 'evidence', 'girls', 'were', 'ever', 'there.The', 'two', 'families', 'Keller', 'particular', 'are', 'convinced', 'Jones', 'where', 'girls', 'are', 'are', 'frustrated', 'released', 'police', 'days', 'Loki', 'other', 'clues', 'still', 'focusing', 'Jones', ""n't"", 'satisfy', 'Keller', 'who', 'eventually', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'kidnaps', 'Jones', 'holding', 'captive', 'old', 'apartment', 'building', 'Villeneuve', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back', 'Keller', 'Jones', 'bloody', 'pulp', 'later', 'moving', 'small', 'closet', 'old', 'fashion', 'water', 'torture', 'going', 'Loki', 'suspect', 'unbeknownst', 'Keller', 'So', 'Jones', 'innocent', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'Holly', 'Jones', 'Alex', 'adoptive', 'aunt', 'critical', 'investigation', 'providing', 'background', 'Alex', 'upbringing', 'own', 'background', 'bit', 'mystery', 'Loki', 'Keller', 'continue', 'probe', 'movie', 'difficult', 'watch', 'not', 'only', 'subject', 'matter', 'torture', 'scenes', 'viewer', 'realize', 'inner', 'animal', 'writing', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'superb', 'Strong', 'performances', 'especially', 'Jackman', 'Keller', 'Davis', 'supporting', 'role', 'Dark', 'foreboding', 'strong', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'will', 'keep', 'talking', 'well', 'final', 'credits', 'roll']",N/A

Prepare yourself for a very emotional, suspenseful, anxiety ridden maze-like trip through a parent's worst nightmare- this movie hits home hard for those of us with children but it's breathtaking raw emotion, keep-you-guessing type plot, and fantastic acting makes it well worth the heartache.The acting is fantastic all around but Jake Gyllenhaal, Hugh Jackman, and Paul Dano steal the show! By the end of the movie, I was left especially hungry to learn more about Gyllenhaal's ""Detective Loki."" The details of his character are incredibly interesting and fitting for his role. Jackman was intense... and I do mean INTENSE. His visceral desperation and anger are felt more than just seen. And Dano brings something to the screen that I have never before seen. We are told he is a mentally disadvantaged man with an intellect no greater than a ten year old and the way this plays out on screen is just brilliant. I'll leave it at that for this non-spoiler part of the review. The rest of the cast does very well also, particularly Terrence Howard and Viola Davis as Franklin and Nancy Birch though the movie does not center around their characters quite as much.The cinematography was brilliant. There were some scenes that could easily have been movie posters, I won't spoil them for you. Overall the movie was beautifully shot.As far as music and sound go, I have to say I don't remember any of the music from the film. This is not necessarily a bad thing as I would prefer it not be memorable in a bad way so as to distract from what is being portrayed but it also means that it wasn't amazing. The sound, however, is a different story. There were moments of complete silence in the movie where the silence itself was a sound effect. There were intense moments that were accented by incredibly clear and poignant sound that fit the scene.Plot, oh boy was there plot! A great, edge of the seat, thrilling plot that just smacked me in the face every couple of minutes! The movie goes on for about 2.5 hours and the whole time I was glued to the screen. What an incredible story!********WARNING: HUGE SPOILERS BELOW, don't read any further unless you have seen the movie or for some reason just want to destroy the experience of watching this film for yourself.*******************************************************************************************************************Ok, just so we are all on the same page, I am going to go through the plot and piece things together since there seems to be a bit of confusion on Who Bobby Taylor was, how joy escaped, and what the Leo's were actually doing to children.We start off being introduced to Keller Dover and his son , Ralph. Keller recites the Lord's Prayer and his son lines up a shot for a deer. This scene is blatantly metaphorical for ""doing what is necessary"" in Keller's perspective. It also shows how Ralph is becoming a man. This plays well against Alex Jones because it shows you what Alex never had and why he isn't a ""man"" but rather still a 10 year old boy. (Obviously abuse and drugs/snake venom had something to do with it too). This is how Keller works, he doesn't enjoy killing the deer but it is necessary to him and the ends justify the means. The prayer shows us that he doesn't ""shoot the deer"" for his own enjoyment, it is a means by which he can get what he needs for his family. This foreshadows the exact sentiment felt when he tortures Alex.We can now skip ahead to the children disappearing. We meet Detective Loki. He has tattoos but he hides them constantly. He clasps his hands to hide his knuckle tattoos and he buttons his shirt to the top button to hide his neck tattoos. He wears a masonic ring, His tattoos and his opening lines indicate that he has an interest in Zodiac signs and astrology- all information we are given throughout the film indicates that he had a rough past and was possibly a criminal turned cop. Loki is a prisoner of his past.Keller becomes a prisoner to his desperation, doing things he would never have done under normal circumstances, likewise his wife becomes a prisoner to her medication as a way of dealing with the tragedy of losing her daughter. Ralph becomes a prisoner of the house, his father the jailor. He is told to watch over his mother and stay home. Alex becomes Keller's prisoner in a very literal sense.  The children are obviously prisoners- I could go on. Everyone in the movie is a prisoner to something by this point.The RV is gone over CSI-Miami style and nothing is found- this is because Alex merely let the kids in, let them play and sing while he drove them to his ""aunt's"" house. This is what he meant when he said ""They didn't cry until I left them."" It also explains Ms. Leo's later comment that he only played with the children. Loki continues tracking down leads by visiting local sex offenders and happens upon a body in the creepy as f*** basement/crawl-space/nightmare-dungeon under the Priest's house. This body is wearing a necklace with a  circular maze etched on it, hmmmmm. It is also explained that the man has kidnapped and killed at least 16 children. This man is Ms. Leo's husband that she said disappeared after a fight. He is also the ""invisible man"" that the book in Bobby Taylor's house is about.Speaking of Bobby Taylor, aka ""The Snake Guy,"" he was a former abductee, taken by the Leo's when he was  just a boy. He escaped somehow, it isn't ever explained, but he is now damaged and seeks to recreate the efforts of his captors to try and understand their motives. He is obsessed with it, going as far as stealing abducted children's clothes, spattering them with pigs blood and claiming to have killed them. He buries child-manikins in his yard after bashing in their heads. He is a mixture of a victim with Stockholm syndrome, a child, and a copycat killer. He too, is a prisoner to his past, he even goes so far as to wear the same jacket as Ms. Leo does (more on that later).So the Leo's have had a process that is now continued only by Ms. Leo since Mr. Leo is dead. By the end of the movie, we should be able to conclude that The Leo's had a son who died of cancer. They were religious prior to this and afterward, unable to reconcile the tragedy with their religion, they reject their religion and begin to ""wage war on god"" by abducting other people's children, creating ""demons"" aka the broken, parents of the abducted children. They do this alone at first and later by having Alex find and pick up children. The children are then delivered to the Leo's house where they are given Kool-Aid laced with ketamine and LCD and told that they can leave when they have solved a book fool of mazes. The catch is, the last maze, the same one that Mr. Leo wore around his neck, is unsolvable. Eventually the children are injected with snake venom and buried. This is exactly what happened to Joy and Anna but Joy was able to get away before she was injected. (Some might argue that there is a different order to it but this is the gist. All these things happen, it may be done in a different order depending on the kid)How did Joy get away? The movie tells you but it is a bit difficult to piece it together. We see Joy's flash backs when she is in the hospital room and it shows a person wearing a jacket carrying Anna in the right arm and reaching for Joy (who is running away) with her left. It also shows two bottles of the laced Kool-Aid, one full and one half empty. We can deduce that it was Ms. Leo in the Jacket, and that Joy did not drink her Kool-Aid. This fits with what Ms. Leo said about having to move the girls inside after Detective Loki was snooping around the car outside. Thus when Ms. Leo was moving them inside, Joy ran away and was picked up by a passing motorist.All this is pieced together when Keller visits Joy in the hospital and she says ""You were there. She put tape on our mouths!"" Keller thinks back and realizes the only place he has gone where there was a female suspect was the Leo's home. Joy must have heard his voice through the thin walls. He gains entry by half-heartedly pretending to offer assistance fixing up the house and ignores the obviously hidden weapon in her hand. This is the only part of the plot that made me cringe. We all knew she had a gun, and Keller should have too.So he gets drugged, shot,  and thrown in the pit- Loki finds Alex in Keller's old apartment building, in pretty bad shape assumingly. He is tasked with telling Ms. Leo they found Alex. Detective Loki lets himself in, finds Ms. Leo injecting Anna with venom and a firefight ensues, in which Loki gets grazed on the head and Ms. Leo gets gunned down. The scene where Loki drives Anna to the hospital was amazing. The lighting, the blurry eyes, the rain, the anxiety... MAN! PERFECT!The end of the movie wraps up pretty neatly. Loki hears Keller blowing the whistle and we know that he finds Keller, and we know that Keller goes to Jail (based on previous comments made by Loki in the hospital).This movie used the maze as a theme constantly. Think about how you would solve a maze on a piece of paper, following one trail until it dead ends and having to backtrack and pick a different branch, sometimes overlooking the right path until it is the only one left. That is how the plot played out, that is how each prisoner felt inside their prison.

It starts off like one of those typical &#8220;I must find my daughter!&#8221; films. I was afraid it would be boring.3. It eventually turns out to be closer to &#8220;Silence of the Lambs&#8221;. It wasn&#8217;t even close to being boring.4. Hugh Jackman plays one of the fathers and Jake Gyllenhaal plays the detective. Each of them follows different leads to find the girls, with different results. The audience is left to decide for themselves which man &#8211; if either of them &#8211; is doing the right thing.5. I&#8217;ve always been a fan of Gyllenhaal, and he is right on point here. He&#8217;s intense, layered, and commands the screen every time he&#8217;s on.6. I&#8217;ve always been kind of &#8220;meh&#8221; about Jackman, but he surprised me with this. He has a fiercely raw emotion that makes you believe the lengths to which he&#8217;ll go to find his daughter. This is the best, most mature role I&#8217;ve ever seen him in.7. The movie is almost two-and-a-half hours long, which gives plenty of time for the story and characters to marinate and come together. It repeatedly takes turns that I wasn&#8217;t expecting.8. It is well written, not only as a thriller, but as a psychological examination of two complicated men and the demons who drive them.9. It was originally rated NC-17 for being extremely violent.

This is  movie making at it's most dramatic and breathtaking. Like films of the past with a similar style and story such as Zodiac and Seven, it's the stuff legends are made of. At the time I am writing this, the Oscar contenders have not yet been announced. That being said, it would be a miracle if this film is not nominated for numerous Oscars and does not win. everything about this movie is top notch, the direction is superb, the pace is electrifying, the music is foreboding and haunting. And most of all the acting is incredible. Hugh Jackman gives a performance that has to be seen to be believed. I predict he will be nominated for best actor and likely will win the Oscar. Performances this intense, believable and this raw and lifelike are rare in cinema. This is a performance of a lifetime. I'm simply astonished at Jackman's performance. And Terrence Howard also turns in what I think is the best performance of his career. I have never much cared for him all that much until now. In fact I always find him rather annoying. I don't know why. But I have a refreshed opinion of Howard after seeing this movie. His performance here is brilliant. It's understated and to his credit it is absolutely beautiful acting. One of the best supporting performances I have ever seen. This movie never goes where you expect and never ends up where you think it will. The mood of the film is grim and haunting. It never let go of me and sucked me in until the very end. It's been awhile since I have been this enthralled with any movie no matter what the genre.

I must mention that there are some scenes that are intensely difficult to watch... you are basically seeing a man being tortured.  I am not one for gratuitous violence, but I can honestly say that I don't believe the violence in this film was gratuitous.  It was disgusting and painful, but it was far from disingenuous.The entire time that Hugh Jackman's character, Keller Dover, is torturing who he is absolutely certain has something to do with his missing daughter - Jackman plays crazy-obsessive so well that you begin to ask yourself, &#34;Did this guy really do it, or is Keller torturing the wrong man?&#34;  Especially when the tortured man whispers, &#34;Help me,&#34; to Nancy Birch (the mother of the other missing daughter; and supremely played by Viola Davis).It is a very intense movie.  The writer (Aaron Guzikowski) and director (Denis Villeneuve) plotted out such a well-structured story, with actors who are incredibly believable.  There isn't a parental reaction that you can't empathize with:  Keller Dover/Hugh Jackman's obsessive need to defend and protect.  Franklin Birch/Terrence Howard willingness to find his daughter, but constantly questioning his own morality at torturing another human being.  Nancy Birch/Viola Davis just wants her daughter back; she supports Jackman's actions if there is even the slightest possibility of getting their children back.  Grace Dover/Maria Bello who is comatose with grief, but propels the story along for the detective (my favorite part of the movie was Jake Gyllenhaal).And then there's Jake Gyllenhaal character Detective Loki; who is just as obsessed with finding the missing girls as Jackman, but he doesn't lose sight of the law or his place in the justice system.  As I said, this was a masterfully crafted movie.  It used the plot and characters to move it along and tell the story.  When was the last time that happened in a movie?  There is no over the top CG, just great acting and superb story telling.  I loved it!This is the kind of movie where you have to pay attention because everything is a clue.  As I watched Jake Gyllenhaal interview Mrs. Millard, I kept thinking &#34;how does a child abduction over ten years old have anything to do with the suspect who barely looks twenty?&#34; ... but it was an integral part of discovering the culprit.Also, I&#8217;ve seen some reviews mention the language/cursing and I couldn&#8217;t help but think, this is a movie about a man who decides to torture another human being who may or may not have had anything to do with his daughter&#8217;s abduction, and the one thing that bothered you is the cursing&#8230; really??Watch this movie, but I don&#8217;t recommend this on a family movie night (too intense for the kiddies).  Prepare to yell at the TV (especially at the incredible ending), and cringe with frustration and hope.  I hope more movies rely on plot and characters.

1323395,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0034G4P30,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Prisoners (Denis Villeneuve, 2013)I'll be up front with you: I am writing the first sentences of this review, which I expect will be a very long one, without knowing what rating I will actually be giving Prisoners. I believe that somewhere over the course of the thousands of reviews I have written (Amazon is home to over six thousand of them as of this writing, on October 5, 2013, and I had been reviewing steadily for longer before I started posting there than I have been since I started, so you can do the math...) that has probably happened before...but I can't remember it, if it has. I have a great deal to mull over before figuring that out, I think. I liked it, overall; there is a great deal to like about it. It is surprisingly well-paced for having come out of a film culture where directors are actively encouraged to make their films about half as long as this one (this is the only film I have seen made in the last fifteen years that is this long that is not either (a) a musical, (b) a Shah Rukh Khan vehicle, or (c ) both of the above), it is unflinching in its examination of violence, its script is intelligent and multi-layered (though it does overplay its hand now and again), it is impeccably-cast, and I could keep going like this all night without really digging into the film at all. But it is not perfect, and while I admit I finished watching it less than an hour and a half before I am writing the opening words of this review, the more I think about the nagging questions I walked out of the theater with, the more they nag at me. Time will tell (and probably will, before I finish writing this review, which will probably be a few weeks from now&#8212;if I follow standard operating procedure with it, anyway) if they continue to nag, but the biggest thing that bothered me, and my first impression is that much of this comes from Jake Gyllenhaal being one of the male leads, is that I saw a lot of Zodiac in this movie. I also saw a lot of Snowtown, which is harder to explain away. That made some of what unfolded on the screen before me more predictable than, I think, it should have been; almost certainly more than screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband) intended. But we shall see after I keep mulling it over; I'm going to go do some more of that right now.Plot: Keller Dover (X-Men's Hugh Jackman) and Frankin Burch (Hustle and Flow's Terrence Howard) are friends in the suburbs. They get together for Thanksgiving; their daughters go out, saying they're heading over to the other house to do whatever it is that preteen girls do away form the prying eyes of their parents. They never make it. Suspicion is immediately cast on a broken-down old camper that has been seen in the area; when the police track it down in the dark corner of a convenience store parking lot, they find its driver to be young mentally-challenged Alex Jones (The Good Heart's Paul Dano). The police, in the form of one Detective Loki (The Day After Tomorrow's Jake Gyllenhaal), interrogate Jones, but do not have enough evidence to go anywhere with it; he is ultimately released, leading Dover to take matters into his own hands. Initially, Burch goes along with Dover's plan for extracting information, but the longer things go one, the more Dover pulls away not only from Burch, but from the rest of his life. Eventually, people start noticing that Alex has gone missing, and Detective Loki's focus hones in on Dover.And now back to my initial paragraph, which I wrote five months before this one. About 80% of this movie is phenomenal, a thought-provoking journey into the motivations and actions of people who are driven to desperation. The other 20% feels as if it were tacked on for a commercial audience who would not be satisfied with that and needed some sort of conventional mystery to resolve. It's trite, relies on plot twists you've seen in half a hundred other movies of its ilk, and while it is as well-presented as the rest of the movie&#8212;these are all fine actors turning in fine performances, Villeneuve (Incendies) certainly knows his way around a camera, and  Roger Deakins was nominated for an Oscar for his chilling cinematography (he lost to, of course, Gravity)&#8212;it still feels kind of like the old Irving Pichel trick of &#8220;hey, we finished shooting a week early and have some extra stock, let's make another movie!&#8221;...except this time they stitched the two together, and the graft didn't quite take. The straight mystery at the end is watchable, but in juxtaposition to the drama/thriller/horror film that comes before it, it pales. Should you see it? Absolutely. Is it, as IMDB would have us believe as I am writing this in March 2014, one of the 250 best movies ever made (it is sitting at #249)?

1323398,A21VR7M8O55EF6,B0034G4P30,Robin Friedman,"[3, 5]","Directed by Dennis Villeneuve, this crime thriller received a poor review in the local paper, but a strong recommendation from a friend prompted me to see it.  The movie played at the Toronto Film Festival before its release. It was the top box office draw the first weekend after its release on September 20.At over 2.5 hours, ""Prisoners"" is long and begins slowly. The tension builds throughout, however, as the tangled plot develops. The film held my attention. In noting the commercial success of the movie, the ""Los Angeles Times"" aptly described it as a ""head spinning hybrid combining elements that are rarely combined."" These elements include noir and murder together with meditations on violence, vigilantism, religion, and parenting.The two lead characters, Keller Dover and Detective Laki are played respectively by Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhall.  Dover is a home repair contractor and a fundamentalist Christian. Laki is a tight-lipped, hardbitten, and successful tattooed detective. Gyllenhall's portrayal is a highlight of the movie.Dover and his wife visit their friends and neighbors, the Birches, for Thanksgiving, and the two daughters of the couples are mysteriously abducted. The movie involves a search for the perpetrator with Laki the lead detective assigned to the case. Attention focuses on a young man, Alex Jones, (Paul Dano) who it turns out has the I.Q. of a boy of ten. When the police release Jones, Dover takes the law into his own hands and kidnaps and brutally beats him as the suspected abductor. The Birches back off from the cruelty but don't report Dover to the police. The convoluted plot develops through many twists as Laki works with determination to save the girls and find the kidnapper.There are several ""prisoners"" to give the movie its title, including the two abducted girls and Alex. Possibly the chief ""prisoner"" is Dover, who is an internal prisoner of his fear, anger and thirst for vengeance.The movie includes substantial and somewhat ersatz religious symbolism. Besides Dover's fundamentalism, (the hymn ""What a Friend we have in Jesus"" plays ironically throughout) the movie features a priest who is a sexual predator as well as characters who lose their religious faith when their young son dies of cancer.

1323435,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B0034G4P30,Stephanie De Pue,"[5, 8]","PRISONERS, (2013). This crime drama/thriller, set in contemporary smalltown Pennsylvania, USA, examines the responses of  parents of kidnapped children to their desperate situation.  As written by Denis Villeneuve and directed by Aaron Guzikowski, this is one star-spangled suspenser.To summarize the plot, let me quote from Warner Bros. Pictures, the releasing studio, as printed at IMDb:How far would you go to protect your family? Keller Dover is facing every parent's worst nightmare. His six-year-old daughter, Anna, is missing, together with her young friend, Joy, and as minutes turn to hours, panic sets in. The only lead is a dilapidated RV that had earlier been parked on their street. Heading the investigation, Detective Loki arrests its driver, Alex Jones, but a lack of evidence forces his release. As the police pursue multiple leads and pressure mounts, knowing his child's life is at stake the frantic Dover decides he has no choice but to take matters into his own hands. But just how far will this desperate father go to protect his family?Hugh Jackman, (WOLVERINE), as Keller Dover, turns in a towering performance that carries the picture.  Jake Gyllenhaal, (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN), as Detective Loki, holds his own and then some, no easy thing.  Admired actor Terrence Howard (CRASH) plays Franklin Birch, father of Joy, the other missing girl.  Oscar-winning Viola Davis, (THE HELP), plays Nancy Birch, mother of Joy;  the Pennsylvania-born Maria Bello (A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE)  plays Grace Dover, mother of Anna.  Paul Dano plays Alex Jones, Oscar-winner Melissa Leo, (THE FIGHTER), plays Holly Jones, the aunt with whom he lives.  Dylan Minnette, who pops up everywhere playing teenage sons, plays Ralph, the Dovers' son.  Broadway favorite Len Cariou plays Father Patrick Dunn, an important supporting role.The film is long, at 153 minutes, and I sometimes thought it could be cut by at least 30-45 minutes, particularly in some distasteful scenes apparently designed to illustrate techniques of `enhanced interrogation.'  It also seems some of us are meant to hate Keller Dover from the opening, in which he encourages his son to shoot a deer.  It is the first day of the state approved hunting season, Thanksgiving, no less.  Dover seems an illustration of the perceived-in-some-quarters gun-toting survivalist politics of the rural, poor mountainous Appalachian spine of the state, sandwiched between the richer and more liberal Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. I hated Dover throughout the picture, only to realize when I thought it over later that he was on to something all along.  Which is quite a feat of script-writing.  The presence of Melissa Leo in a supporting part is another illustration of the DePue dictum of casting: the presence of an actor more important/expensive than the part seems to require is a tipoff that the part's going to be more important than you think.  The squeamish might want to close their eyes sometimes, but thriller lovers will not want to miss this one.",5,"A Chilller to the End, and Then Some",1382745600,"10 26, 2013",2013,3013,"['PRISONERS', '2013', 'crime', 'drama/thriller', 'set', 'contemporary', 'smalltown', 'Pennsylvania', 'USA', 'responses', 'parents', 'kidnapped', 'children', 'desperate', 'situation', 'written', 'Denis', 'Villeneuve', 'directed', 'Aaron', 'Guzikowski', 'one', 'star-spangled', 'suspenser.To', 'summarize', 'plot', 'let', 'quote', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'Pictures', 'releasing', 'studio', 'printed', 'IMDb', 'How', 'far', 'would', 'go', 'protect', 'family', 'Keller', 'Dover', 'facing', 'parent', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'six-year-old', 'daughter', 'Anna', 'missing', 'together', 'young', 'friend', 'Joy', 'minutes', 'turn', 'hours', 'panic', 'sets', 'only', 'lead', 'dilapidated', 'RV', 'had', 'earlier', 'been', 'parked', 'street', 'Heading', 'investigation', 'Detective', 'Loki', 'driver', 'Alex', 'Jones', 'lack', 'evidence', 'forces', 'release', 'police', 'pursue', 'multiple', 'pressure', 'mounts', 'knowing', 'child', 'life', 'stake', 'frantic', 'Dover', 'choice', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'will', 'desperate', 'father', 'go', 'protect', 'family', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'WOLVERINE', 'Keller', 'Dover', 'towering', 'performance', 'picture', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'BROKEBACK', 'MOUNTAIN', 'Detective', 'Loki', 'own', 'then', 'easy', 'thing', 'Admired', 'actor', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'CRASH', 'Franklin', 'Birch', 'father', 'Joy', 'other', 'missing', 'girl', 'Oscar-winning', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'THE', 'HELP', 'Nancy', 'Birch', 'mother', 'Joy', 'Pennsylvania-born', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'A', 'HISTORY', 'OF', 'VIOLENCE', 'Grace', 'Dover', 'mother', 'Anna', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'Alex', 'Jones', 'Oscar-winner', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'THE', 'FIGHTER', 'Holly', 'Jones', 'aunt', 'whom', 'Dylan', 'Minnette', 'who', 'up', 'everywhere', 'playing', 'teenage', 'sons', 'plays', 'Ralph', 'Dovers', 'son', 'Broadway', 'favorite', 'Len', 'Cariou', 'Father', 'Patrick', 'Dunn', 'important', 'supporting', 'role.The', 'film', 'long', '153', 'minutes', 'sometimes', 'thought', 'could', 'be', 'cut', 'least', '30-45', 'minutes', 'particularly', 'distasteful', 'scenes', 'apparently', 'designed', 'illustrate', 'techniques', 'enhanced', 'interrogation', 'also', 'are', 'meant', 'hate', 'Keller', 'Dover', 'opening', 'son', 'shoot', 'deer', 'first', 'day', 'state', 'approved', 'hunting', 'season', 'Thanksgiving', 'less', 'Dover', 'illustration', 'perceived-in-some-quarters', 'gun-toting', 'survivalist', 'politics', 'rural', 'poor', 'mountainous', 'Appalachian', 'spine', 'state', 'sandwiched', 'richer', 'more', 'liberal', 'Philadelphia', 'Pittsburgh', 'hated', 'Dover', 'picture', 'only', 'realize', 'when', 'thought', 'over', 'later', 'was', 'something', 'all', 'along', 'Which', 'quite', 'feat', 'script-writing', 'presence', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'supporting', 'part', 'illustration', 'DePue', 'dictum', 'casting', 'presence', 'actor', 'more', 'important/expensive', 'part', 'require', 'tipoff', 'part', 'going', 'be', 'more', 'important', 'think', 'squeamish', 'might', 'want', 'close', 'eyes', 'sometimes', 'thriller', 'lovers', 'will', 'not', 'want', 'miss', 'one']",N/A

The girls have wandered outside to play and go unnoticed for some time while the families enjoy one another's company.  Eventually, people begin to notice their absence and then, very quickly, panic sets in and the two fathers (Hugh Jackman and Terrence Howard) run off to look for them.  In the meantime Jackman's son remembers that, earlier, the girls were fascinated by a motorhome parked a little way down the street when they had gone out prior to dinner.  He tells his father and they go to look for the motorhome, which is now gone.Enter the police, primarily in the form of Jake Gyllenhaal, who quickly locate the motorhome and its sole occupant and bring him into custody.  However, when they try to interrogate him they find that he has the mental age of a 10 year old and are forced to release him after a forensic search shows no physical evidence of the missing girls in the vehicle.This incenses Jackman's character who decides to take matters into his own hands with grim consequences!  This film examines the obvious toll on all the members of a family whose child has been abducted and we witness the harrowing aftermath for all concerned as the tragedy unfolds before our eyes.  The movie seems more to have echoes of `Dead Zone' rather than `Taken', as it scrutinizes the almost Gothic weirdness of small town America beneath the Norman Rockwell homespun, 'apple pie' type images that we are often fed.And it's all the more disturbing in the wake of the recent revelations, in Austria, America and elsewhere of kidnappings, imprisonment and even the enslavement of abducted children who seem simply to disappear into thin air and the twisted logic of the individuals who perpetrate this evil, often seeking to mitigate their actions in religious terms!The whole cast puts in very convincing performances and this, together with an intelligent script, makes for horribly compelling viewing but one you probably won&#8217;t want to repeat any time soon!",4,"Thought provoking but, be warned, deeply disturbing!",1394496000,"03 11, 2014",2014,2095,"['Two', 'young', 'girls', 'are', 'abducted', 'Thanksgiving', 'meal', 'where', 'two', 'families', 'are', 'celebrating', 'home', 'one', 'girls', 'have', 'wandered', 'play', 'go', 'unnoticed', 'time', 'families', 'enjoy', 'one', 'company', 'Eventually', 'people', 'begin', 'notice', 'absence', 'then', 'very', 'quickly', 'panic', 'sets', 'two', 'fathers', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'run', 'off', 'look', 'meantime', 'Jackman', 'son', 'remembers', 'earlier', 'girls', 'were', 'fascinated', 'motorhome', 'parked', 'little', 'way', 'street', 'when', 'had', 'gone', 'out', 'prior', 'dinner', 'father', 'go', 'look', 'motorhome', 'now', 'gone.Enter', 'police', 'primarily', 'form', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'who', 'quickly', 'locate', 'motorhome', 'sole', 'occupant', 'bring', 'custody', 'However', 'when', 'try', 'interrogate', 'find', 'mental', 'age', '10', 'year', 'old', 'are', 'forced', 'release', 'forensic', 'search', 'physical', 'evidence', 'missing', 'girls', 'vehicle.This', 'Jackman', 'character', 'who', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'grim', 'consequences', 'film', 'obvious', 'toll', 'members', 'family', 'child', 'been', 'abducted', 'witness', 'harrowing', 'aftermath', 'concerned', 'tragedy', 'eyes', 'movie', 'more', 'have', 'echoes', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'rather', 'Taken', 'almost', 'Gothic', 'weirdness', 'small', 'town', 'America', 'Norman', 'Rockwell', 'homespun', 'pie', 'type', 'images', 'are', 'often', 'fed.And', 'more', 'disturbing', 'wake', 'recent', 'revelations', 'Austria', 'America', 'elsewhere', 'kidnappings', 'imprisonment', 'even', 'enslavement', 'abducted', 'children', 'who', 'seem', 'simply', 'disappear', 'thin', 'air', 'twisted', 'logic', 'individuals', 'who', 'perpetrate', 'evil', 'often', 'seeking', 'mitigate', 'actions', 'religious', 'terms', 'whole', 'cast', 'very', 'convincing', 'performances', 'together', 'intelligent', 'script', 'horribly', 'compelling', 'viewing', 'one', 'probably', 'won', '8217', 'want', 'repeat', 'time', 'soon']",N/A

Yawn. I really liked the ""Dirty Harry"" version of this genre. Go ahead. Compare the dialog. Make my day.

1323454,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B0034G4P30,The People's Critic,"[1, 2]","Prisoners is an outstanding new mystery/thriller that manages to sustain its tension right to the last second.If you have seen the trailer, you know quite a bit about Prisoners.Hugh Jackman plays Keller Dover, a construction worker who lives in a quiet New England suburb with his wife (Maria Bello), teenage son, and six year old daughter. While spending Thanksgiving with the family of his life-long friend and neighbor, Franklin Birch (Terrance Howard), Keller and Franklin discover that both of their daughters are suddenly missing.After frantically searching the area, the only lead they have is a strange RV that was parked in the area.With the help of Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) and the police, they are able to track down the RV and apprehend a suspect (Paul Dano), but due to his mental incapacity and lack of evidence, he is released.This sends Prisoners in a harrowing new direction as Keller and Franklin wade through some ethically murky waters in the search for their daughters.Prisoners does a phenomenal job of keeping its cards close to the vest.In its transition from drama to revenge thriller, director Denis Villenuve and writer Aaron Guzikowski do not force the film in any one direction continuously playing with the audience's sensibilities.Villenuve and Guzikowski are relative newcomers to the scene, although Villenuve did helm the 2010 Best Foreign Film Oscar nominee, Incendies.This is also a very smart movie in that it is not a run of the mill type of thriller.Several nuanced touches and motifs present themselves that allow the film to be absorbed to a deeper level, resulting in a film that stays with you long after you leave the theater.Take special note of the film's opening scene and revisit it after having seen the movie for a taste of what I'm talking about.ImageHoly smokes! Look at all of those awards...sorry Paul Dano.The film manages the gripping tone of films like Silence of the Lambs or Zodiac.The film also looks great.It was shot by Roger Deakins, known for his work with the Coen Brothers on most of their projects.With Prisoners, Deakins uses his static and deliberate camera movements to enhance every suspenseful opportunity.It's a tremendously well-crafted picture and a finely acted one as well.The film boasts Academy Award winners and nominees aplenty, and all of them are looking for more in this film.Gyllanhaal is especially good at elevating the traditional detective character to something more relatable, raw, and grounded.This is, however, Jackman's movie in every way.He takes the audience on a wild ride of emotion bringing just the right amount of crazy to keep us from judging his choices too harshly.Prisoners is not just a good start to the fall movie season, it sets the bar.Few films offer such chilling emotion, engrossing action, and captivating performances, especially with running times of 158 minutes!This is truly an excellent film.APrisoners is rated R an has a running time of 2 hours and 38 minutes.Use the restroom before you start it because you won't want to miss a second of it.",5,Prisoners is Intense!,1382572800,"10 24, 2013",2013,3072,"['Prisoners', 'outstanding', 'new', 'mystery/thriller', 'sustain', 'tension', 'right', 'last', 'second.If', 'have', 'seen', 'trailer', 'know', 'quite', 'bit', 'Prisoners.Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Keller', 'Dover', 'construction', 'worker', 'who', 'quiet', 'New', 'England', 'suburb', 'wife', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'teenage', 'son', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'spending', 'Thanksgiving', 'family', 'life-long', 'friend', 'neighbor', 'Franklin', 'Birch', 'Terrance', 'Howard', 'Keller', 'Franklin', 'discover', 'daughters', 'are', 'suddenly', 'missing.After', 'frantically', 'searching', 'area', 'only', 'lead', 'have', 'strange', 'RV', 'was', 'parked', 'area.With', 'help', 'Detective', 'Loki', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'police', 'are', 'able', 'track', 'down', 'RV', 'apprehend', 'suspect', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'due', 'mental', 'incapacity', 'lack', 'evidence', 'released.This', 'Prisoners', 'harrowing', 'new', 'direction', 'Keller', 'Franklin', 'wade', 'ethically', 'murky', 'waters', 'search', 'daughters.Prisoners', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'keeping', 'cards', 'close', 'vest.In', 'transition', 'drama', 'revenge', 'thriller', 'director', 'Denis', 'Villenuve', 'writer', 'Aaron', 'Guzikowski', 'do', 'not', 'force', 'film', 'one', 'direction', 'continuously', 'playing', 'audience', 'sensibilities.Villenuve', 'Guzikowski', 'are', 'relative', 'newcomers', 'scene', 'Villenuve', 'did', 'helm', '2010', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Incendies.This', 'also', 'very', 'smart', 'movie', 'not', 'run', 'mill', 'type', 'thriller.Several', 'nuanced', 'touches', 'motifs', 'present', 'allow', 'film', 'be', 'absorbed', 'deeper', 'level', 'resulting', 'film', 'long', 'leave', 'theater.Take', 'special', 'note', 'film', 'opening', 'scene', 'revisit', 'having', 'seen', 'movie', 'taste', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'about.ImageHoly', 'smokes', 'Look', 'awards', 'sorry', 'Paul', 'Dano.The', 'film', 'gripping', 'tone', 'films', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'Zodiac.The', 'film', 'also', 'great.It', 'was', 'shot', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'known', 'work', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'most', 'projects.With', 'Prisoners', 'static', 'deliberate', 'camera', 'movements', 'enhance', 'suspenseful', 'opportunity.It', 'tremendously', 'well-crafted', 'picture', 'finely', 'acted', 'one', 'well.The', 'film', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winners', 'nominees', 'aplenty', 'are', 'looking', 'more', 'film.Gyllanhaal', 'especially', 'good', 'elevating', 'traditional', 'detective', 'character', 'something', 'more', 'relatable', 'raw', 'grounded.This', 'however', 'Jackman', 'movie', 'way.He', 'audience', 'wild', 'ride', 'emotion', 'bringing', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'crazy', 'keep', 'judging', 'choices', 'too', 'harshly.Prisoners', 'not', 'just', 'good', 'start', 'fall', 'movie', 'season', 'bar.Few', 'films', 'offer', 'such', 'chilling', 'emotion', 'engrossing', 'action', 'captivating', 'performances', 'especially', 'running', 'times', '158', 'minutes', 'truly', 'excellent', 'film.APrisoners', 'rated', 'R', 'running', 'time', '2', 'hours', '38', 'minutes.Use', 'restroom', 'start', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'second']",N/A
1323455,A1Y2GZGBMICFG8,B0034G4P30,The Separator,"[1, 2]","Denis Villeneuve&#8217;s Prisoners is way better than it looks in the trailer. The trailer seems to give away all the secrets of the film upfront; it portrays the film as lacking depth, but in reality, it&#8217;s just the trailer that misleads. There is much more to Prisoners than one may anticipate.The film stars Hugh Jackman (surprise, surprise) as Keller Dover. Jackman is having an over-exposure problem at this moment in his career. As the actor seems to appear in every other film released these days, this creates questions that shouldn&#8217;t exist like, &#8220;What is the Wolverine doing in this movie Prisoners?&#8221; Nonetheless Jackman delivers a solid, if not dimensional performance. His energy keeps the movie constantly driving forward.The film opens with two working class families getting together to celebrate Thanksgiving. Festivities abound, but while the responsible adults of the film have their attentions focused elsewhere, their two little girls run outside to play, unchaperoned. By the time the girls&#8217; absence is noticed, it&#8217;s too late. The girls are gone. They have been taken. The major conflict of the film then is how to get the girls back alive.This job falls on Detective Loki, (Jake Gyllenhaal) but when Loki fails to produce results quickly enough, Keller Dover decides to take the search for the girls, and for civil justice, into his own hands. Performance-wise, Gyllenhaal as Loki is the highlight of the film. He maintains a subtle, calm composure, which contrasts Keller&#8217;s (Jackman&#8217;s) constant flying-off-the-rails. Loki shows a certain vulnerability while still being able to pull off fast-pace action sequences in an authentic, belivable way. He is very enjoyable to watch.The actual visual experience of Villeneuve&#8217;s films is very important. His 2010 film Incendies made full use of wide and vast cinematography applied in exotic landscapes. This visual imagery captivated, but all the technique was there to serve the story, the plot developments, the characters. Incendies is a masterfully crafted tragedy and Villeneuve&#8217;s commanding technique is evident too throughout Prisoners.Like Incendies the filters and tones that are applied to the film, as in the actual visual images on screen, are gloomy and sepia-toned. There&#8217;s not a single sunny sky, a warm day, an orderly room. Sets are designed to feel dark and empty, the best scenes use sets that play with space, showing both the abundance of vacant space for some characters, while still emphasizing the feeling of enclosure felt by others. The use of light and dark, order and disorder, space, all things that cradle the actors performances, are created by Villeneuve, expertly.The suspense of the film continues all the way to the very end as Keller Dover&#8217;s untamed compulsion to find the missing girls leads to a perfectly executed, nail biter of an ending.Get more at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com",5,Exceeded expectaions,1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,2952,"['Denis', 'Villeneuve', '8217', 's', 'Prisoners', 'way', 'better', 'trailer', 'trailer', 'give', 'away', 'secrets', 'film', 'upfront', 'film', 'lacking', 'depth', 'reality', '8217', 'just', 'trailer', 'much', 'more', 'Prisoners', 'one', 'may', 'anticipate.The', 'film', 'stars', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'surprise', 'surprise', 'Keller', 'Dover', 'Jackman', 'having', 'over-exposure', 'problem', 'moment', 'career', 'actor', 'appear', 'other', 'film', 'released', 'days', 'questions', 'shouldn', '8217', 'exist', '8220', 'What', 'Wolverine', 'doing', 'movie', 'Prisoners', '8221', 'Nonetheless', 'Jackman', 'solid', 'not', 'dimensional', 'performance', 'energy', 'movie', 'constantly', 'driving', 'forward.The', 'film', 'two', 'working', 'class', 'families', 'getting', 'together', 'celebrate', 'Thanksgiving', 'Festivities', 'abound', 'responsible', 'adults', 'film', 'have', 'attentions', 'focused', 'elsewhere', 'two', 'little', 'girls', 'run', 'outside', 'play', 'unchaperoned', 'time', 'girls', '8217', 'absence', 'noticed', '8217', 's', 'too', 'late', 'girls', 'are', 'gone', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'major', 'conflict', 'film', 'then', 'how', 'get', 'girls', 'back', 'alive.This', 'job', 'falls', 'Detective', 'Loki', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'when', 'Loki', 'produce', 'results', 'quickly', 'enough', 'Keller', 'Dover', 'take', 'search', 'girls', 'civil', 'justice', 'own', 'hands', 'Performance-wise', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Loki', 'highlight', 'film', 'subtle', 'calm', 'composure', 'Keller', '8217', 's', 'Jackman', '8217', 'constant', 'flying-off-the-rails', 'Loki', 'certain', 'vulnerability', 'still', 'being', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'fast-pace', 'action', 'sequences', 'authentic', 'belivable', 'way', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'watch.The', 'actual', 'visual', 'experience', 'Villeneuve', '8217', 's', 'films', 'very', 'important', '2010', 'film', 'Incendies', 'made', 'full', 'use', 'wide', 'vast', 'cinematography', 'applied', 'exotic', 'landscapes', 'visual', 'imagery', 'captivated', 'technique', 'was', 'there', 'serve', 'story', 'plot', 'developments', 'characters', 'Incendies', 'masterfully', 'crafted', 'tragedy', 'Villeneuve', '8217', 'commanding', 'technique', 'evident', 'too', 'Prisoners.Like', 'Incendies', 'filters', 'tones', 'are', 'applied', 'film', 'actual', 'visual', 'images', 'screen', 'are', 'gloomy', 'sepia-toned', '8217', 'not', 'single', 'sunny', 'sky', 'warm', 'day', 'orderly', 'room', 'Sets', 'are', 'designed', 'feel', 'dark', 'empty', 'best', 'scenes', 'use', 'sets', 'play', 'space', 'showing', 'abundance', 'vacant', 'space', 'characters', 'still', 'emphasizing', 'feeling', 'enclosure', 'felt', 'others', 'use', 'light', 'dark', 'order', 'disorder', 'space', 'things', 'cradle', 'actors', 'performances', 'are', 'created', 'Villeneuve', 'expertly.The', 'suspense', 'film', 'way', 'very', 'end', 'Keller', 'Dover', '8217', 'untamed', 'compulsion', 'find', 'missing', 'girls', 'perfectly', 'executed', 'nail', 'biter', 'ending.Get', 'more', 'getthebonesaw.blogspot.com']",N/A

1323457,A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S,B0034G4P30,Thomas E. Davis,"[8, 12]","""Prisoners"" is a bleak, gripping mystery thriller that stays with you. It's a long and involving tale of two rural Pennsylvania families devastated by the theft of their young daughters on Thanksgiving Day and of a man so driven by the loss that he is willing to do almost anything to rescue them, consequences be damned. Comparisons to the films ""Mystic River,"" ""Gone Baby Gone,"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"" are inevitable, but don't let the fact that it's a genre picture deter you. The twists and turns of this confidently plotted drama will have you riveted to your seat, and the final scenes will give you more than one shock.The film's running time of two-and-a-half hours is fully justified; there isn't a wasted moment on screen. I won't give away any details (if you want a plot synopsis, there's always Wikipedia), but be prepared to be put through an emotional wringer. The film, set in the late fall, is suffused with a wintery aura of dread and menace. The deliberate pace never lets us forget the seemingly endless wait that families of kidnapping victims must endure. Every clue that is dropped pitches us from hope into despair and back again. And a warning is in order: there are brutal scenes of torture that are deeply disturbing.""Prisoners"" is filled with searing performances by an A-list of Hollywood's finest actors, led by Hugh Jackman as a desperate father who becomes a frightening mirror image of the monsters he pursues and Jake Gyllenhaal as a dogged detective who confronts a labyrinthine web of horror and depravity. The other anguished parents are heartbreakingly played by Maria Bello, Terrence Howard, and Viola Davis, while Oscar-winner Melissa Leo appears as the mother of a disabled man, portrayed by Paul Dano, who is a prime suspect in the girls' disappearance. All of these actors, together with the film, director Denis Villeneuve, and screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski, will earn consideration for Academy Awards in 2014.",5,"A dark, complex, challenging film with a superb cast",1384646400,"11 17, 2013",2013,1958,"['Prisoners', 'bleak', 'gripping', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'long', 'involving', 'tale', 'two', 'rural', 'Pennsylvania', 'families', 'devastated', 'theft', 'young', 'daughters', 'Thanksgiving', 'Day', 'man', 'so', 'driven', 'loss', 'willing', 'do', 'almost', 'anything', 'rescue', 'consequences', 'be', 'damned', 'Comparisons', 'films', 'Mystic', 'River', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'are', 'inevitable', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'fact', 'genre', 'picture', 'deter', 'twists', 'turns', 'confidently', 'plotted', 'drama', 'will', 'have', 'riveted', 'seat', 'final', 'scenes', 'will', 'give', 'more', 'one', 'shock.The', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'two-and-a-half', 'hours', 'fully', 'justified', ""n't"", 'wasted', 'moment', 'screen', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'details', 'want', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'always', 'Wikipedia', 'be', 'prepared', 'be', 'put', 'emotional', 'wringer', 'film', 'set', 'late', 'fall', 'suffused', 'wintery', 'aura', 'dread', 'menace', 'deliberate', 'pace', 'never', 'forget', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'wait', 'families', 'kidnapping', 'victims', 'must', 'endure', 'clue', 'dropped', 'pitches', 'hope', 'despair', 'back', 'again', 'warning', 'order', 'are', 'brutal', 'scenes', 'torture', 'are', 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'Prisoners', 'filled', 'searing', 'performances', 'A-list', 'Hollywood', 'finest', 'actors', 'led', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'desperate', 'father', 'who', 'frightening', 'mirror', 'image', 'monsters', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'dogged', 'detective', 'who', 'labyrinthine', 'web', 'horror', 'depravity', 'other', 'anguished', 'parents', 'are', 'heartbreakingly', 'played', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'Oscar-winner', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'mother', 'disabled', 'man', 'portrayed', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'who', 'prime', 'suspect', 'girls', 'disappearance', 'actors', 'together', 'film', 'director', 'Denis', 'Villeneuve', 'screenwriter', 'Aaron', 'Guzikowski', 'will', 'earn', 'consideration', 'Academy', 'Awards', '2014']",N/A

The French Canadian director leads an all star cast in this crime thriller; which gained the attention of many moviegoers.. Already Prisoners is getting praise from critics everywhere; but does the crime thriller live up to the early reviews?The story of Prisoners centers around a case of two missing girls. When Anna and Joy disappear on Thanksgiving, their families do everything in their power to look for them. It comes to the point where Keller Dover, played by Hugh Jackman, abducts and torture suspect Alex Jones. With Detective Loki, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, on the case, everyone involved will discover there is more going on then just a mere kidnapping.Prisoners features a compelling plot that's not hard to follow. You will be guessing all the way through the 2 hour and 33 minute run time.  As a crime story goes, Prisoners is straight forward; but that does work for the movie. Nothing in the story feels it takes you out of the film; nor is there a twist there for the sake of being a twist. Everything in the plot fits, giving Prisoners a story fitting of the genre.While Prisoners has a massive ensemble, the show-stealers are the leads: Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllehaal. While I can't say Hugh Jackman had a ground breaking performance, he still brought his charisma to Keller; creating one dynamic role for the actor. The same applies for Gyllenhaal's Detective Loki; though this is definitely one the actor's best roles in sometime. While the rest of the cast did not have monumental performances, they still fit and gave Prisoners a ensemble to be proud of.What got my attention was the world of the movie. Denis Villenueve's direction in  the cinematography was perfect, giving Prisoners a realistic tone. That and the direction in some of scenes was awe-inspiring. The sequence of Detective Loki driving through traffic was tense and quite possible one of the best shot car scenes I've seen in a while.Prisoners is everything a fan of crime films can hope for. The movie is tense and it keeps you guessing all the way through. Even if you are not shock by the twists in the film, you will be impressed by the movie's execution. Yes , Prisoners did commit a crime, and that crime was capturing this critic's approval.You can also see the review here: [...]",4,A Thrilling Time at The Movies,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,2356,"['crime', 'been', 'committed', 'culprit', 'Denis', 'Villeneuve', 'Prisoners', 'French', 'Canadian', 'director', 'star', 'cast', 'crime', 'thriller', 'gained', 'attention', 'many', 'moviegoers..', 'Already', 'Prisoners', 'getting', 'praise', 'critics', 'everywhere', 'crime', 'thriller', 'live', 'up', 'early', 'reviews', 'story', 'Prisoners', 'centers', 'case', 'two', 'missing', 'girls', 'When', 'Anna', 'Joy', 'disappear', 'Thanksgiving', 'families', 'do', 'everything', 'power', 'look', 'point', 'where', 'Keller', 'Dover', 'played', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'abducts', 'torture', 'suspect', 'Alex', 'Jones', 'Detective', 'Loki', 'played', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'case', 'everyone', 'involved', 'will', 'discover', 'more', 'going', 'then', 'just', 'mere', 'kidnapping.Prisoners', 'compelling', 'plot', 'not', 'hard', 'follow', 'will', 'be', 'guessing', 'way', '2', 'hour', '33', 'minute', 'run', 'time', 'crime', 'story', 'Prisoners', 'straight', 'forward', 'work', 'movie', 'Nothing', 'story', 'film', 'there', 'twist', 'there', 'sake', 'being', 'twist', 'Everything', 'plot', 'fits', 'giving', 'Prisoners', 'story', 'fitting', 'genre.While', 'Prisoners', 'massive', 'ensemble', 'show-stealers', 'are', 'leads', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Jake', 'Gyllehaal', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'had', 'ground', 'breaking', 'performance', 'still', 'brought', 'charisma', 'Keller', 'creating', 'one', 'dynamic', 'role', 'actor', 'same', 'applies', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Detective', 'Loki', 'definitely', 'one', 'actor', 'best', 'roles', 'sometime', 'rest', 'cast', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'monumental', 'performances', 'still', 'fit', 'gave', 'Prisoners', 'ensemble', 'be', 'proud', 'got', 'attention', 'was', 'world', 'movie', 'Denis', 'Villenueve', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'was', 'perfect', 'giving', 'Prisoners', 'realistic', 'tone', 'direction', 'scenes', 'was', 'awe-inspiring', 'sequence', 'Detective', 'Loki', 'driving', 'traffic', 'was', 'tense', 'quite', 'possible', 'one', 'best', 'shot', 'car', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while.Prisoners', 'everything', 'fan', 'crime', 'films', 'can', 'hope', 'movie', 'tense', 'guessing', 'way', 'Even', 'are', 'not', 'shock', 'twists', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'impressed', 'movie', 'execution', 'Yes', 'Prisoners', 'did', 'commit', 'crime', 'crime', 'was', 'capturing', 'critic', 'approval.You', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'review', 'here', '[', ']']",N/A
1323459,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B0034G4P30,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","Prisoners is a prime example of why I will never understand Hollywood. You've got a truly great story, an all-star cast, and a world renowned Director, making his American debut. Prisoners was considered to be an Oscar caliber film before it was even released, yet for some reason they had to make it nearly three hours long. If there was enough story for a three hour film, then I'd be all for it, but Prisoners has a good 45 minutes worth of repetitiveness, that does nothing to help the movie, in fact, it takes something away from the film. The story begins on Thanksgiving, when two little girls go outside to play and disappear. Feeling that the police aren't doing enough to find the kids, one father (Hugh Jackman) decides to take matters into his own hands. Hugh Jackman stars in a role I wouldn't have imagined him playing in a million years. Based on his other roles and what I know about the man, this doesn't even seem like the kind of role he'd be interested in, but he gives one of the strongest performances I've seen all year, I really didn't know he had that in him. Jackman is paired by Jake Gyllenhaal, another guy who I couldn't see playing a tough as nails police detective, but he too surprised, giving a very strong performance. The cast isn't the problem and the story isn't the problem, what bothered me about this film was how much of it was unnecessary. Did we really need dozens of scenes with Jackman and Dano or all the talk and sadness amongst the families? This was a great all-around movie, but it was so long, that by the end, I'd stopped caring about what was happening and just wanted it to be over. Don't get me wrong, I highly recommend this film for a unique twist on classic story, great performances from an unlikely cast, and the work of a Director who his known around the world for his signature style, but just a word of caution. Prisoners is a very long film, that at many points seems to go around in circles. When they eventually do get to the point, it's outstanding, but it takes a while to get there.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1401062400,"05 26, 2014",2014,2052,"['Prisoners', 'prime', 'example', 'why', 'will', 'never', 'understand', 'Hollywood', ""'ve"", 'got', 'truly', 'great', 'story', 'all-star', 'cast', 'world', 'renowned', 'Director', 'making', 'American', 'debut', 'Prisoners', 'was', 'considered', 'be', 'Oscar', 'caliber', 'film', 'was', 'even', 'released', 'yet', 'reason', 'had', 'make', 'nearly', 'three', 'hours', 'long', 'was', 'enough', 'story', 'three', 'hour', 'film', 'then', ""'d"", 'be', 'Prisoners', 'good', '45', 'minutes', 'repetitiveness', 'nothing', 'help', 'movie', 'fact', 'something', 'away', 'film', 'story', 'Thanksgiving', 'when', 'two', 'little', 'girls', 'go', 'outside', 'play', 'disappear', 'Feeling', 'police', 'are', ""n't"", 'doing', 'enough', 'find', 'kids', 'one', 'father', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'role', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'imagined', 'playing', 'million', 'years', 'Based', 'other', 'roles', 'what', 'know', 'man', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'kind', 'role', ""'d"", 'be', 'interested', 'one', 'strongest', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'had', 'Jackman', 'paired', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'guy', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'playing', 'tough', 'nails', 'police', 'detective', 'too', 'surprised', 'giving', 'very', 'strong', 'performance', 'cast', ""n't"", 'problem', 'story', ""n't"", 'problem', 'what', 'bothered', 'film', 'was', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'Did', 'really', 'need', 'dozens', 'scenes', 'Jackman', 'Dano', 'talk', 'sadness', 'amongst', 'families', 'was', 'great', 'all-around', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'long', 'end', ""'d"", 'stopped', 'caring', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'just', 'wanted', 'be', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'unique', 'twist', 'classic', 'story', 'great', 'performances', 'unlikely', 'cast', 'work', 'Director', 'who', 'known', 'world', 'signature', 'style', 'just', 'word', 'caution', 'Prisoners', 'very', 'long', 'film', 'many', 'points', 'go', 'around', 'circles', 'When', 'eventually', 'do', 'get', 'point', 'outstanding', 'while', 'get', 'there']",N/A

His 2011 'Incendies' was interesting but ultimately full of too many scenes which forced the viewer to suspend one's disbelief, one too many times. 'Prisoners' also has some questionable plot points but it's eminently more entertaining than Incendies.Villeneuve proffers up an interesting protagonist, Keller Dover (played by an intense Hugh Jackman), a survivalist type, who has no compunctions about teaching his son how to shoot a deer, on a hunting trip, depicted at the beginning of the film. While Jackman has a lot to work with depicting the hot-head Keller, Terrence Howard has little to do playing Franklin Birch, Keller's exact opposite: a passive (and thinly drawn) middle class black professional. The break into Act II occurs when Keller's and Birch's daughters are abducted after disappearing from the Birch family home.Since an RV was parked right near where the girls disappeared, the driver ends up as the number one suspect. The police soon track the driver down at a rest stop and he tries to escape by eluding a police blockade with his RV. The driver turns out to be Alex Jones, who on the surface appears to be mentally feeble. When Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) can find no evidence linking Alex to the girls' abduction and concludes he doesn't have the mental capacity to kidnap the girls, he's forced to release him, and allow him to return to the residence of Holly Jones, his aunt, a creepy senior, expertly played by Melissa Leo.A good deal of 'Prisoners' revolves around Keller's abduction and subsequent imprisonment of Alex, who he believes knows where the kidnapped girls are. Keller insists that Alex told him ""they didn't cry until I left them,"" when Keller tries to choke him at the time he's released by the police, in front of a multitude of TV news reporters (no one else hears what Alex says to Keller).Before discussing the issue of Alex's refusal to talk, there are two red herrings in the plot, designed to throw you off track. Both involve Detective Loki's interaction with two suspects. The first is a priest who's on parole for a sex crime--out of the blue Loki finds a bound, deceased man in the priest's basement. The priest claims that he was forced to kill the man after he revealed (during confession) that he was a serial killer, who would kill again. Later, Loki chases after a suspicious man seen at a vigil for the missing girls, in front of the Birch's home. He turns out to be a wannabe serial killer, Taylor, who breaks into the family houses of real serial killer's victims and steals their clothes. Loki, who supposedly has solved all of his cases, blows this one, after Taylor grabs one of Loki's deputy's guns and shoots himself in the mouth.Even if you believe in both these incredible turn of events, one is hard pressed to believe in the film's main premise--that Alex would refuse to talk, despite being tortured for days by Keller. SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD. One of the arguments that Alex doesn't talk is because he is mentally handicapped. But that's debunked by the points Keller raises--he knew about the girls and told Keller; he tried to escape from the police in his RV and had a driver's license and was able to drive.Another reason (which seems to be suggested by the filmmakers) is that he's under the spell of Aunt Holly and is either a) afraid of her, b) evil like her, or c) both. He seemingly is given a free pass at film's end, despite Keller's statement that he confessed that he basically knew where the girls were (the free pass may be due to the fact that Keller's credibility was completely suspect, by breaking the law by abducting him). Still, while possible, I still think it's unlikely that Alex would never have turned against the old lady. Think of the child abduction case of Steven Stayner. He was imprisoned for seven years but when given the opportunity, he escaped and saved a newly abducted child. Alex was the first child abducted by Holly and her husband and the filmmakers would like us to believe he was psychologically beholden to his captor. But in real life, the Stayner case proves the opposite. I would like to think the desire for freedom would still burn in Alex's breast and his abduction by Keller would have been the perfect opportunity for him to spill the beans about his aunt. By confessing, he's smart enough to know that Aunt Holly would immediately be taken into custody and he would not have to be afraid of her anymore.Prisoners represents a critique of those who embrace the survivalist mentality and act as vigilantes. We expect Keller to save his daughter but actually Detective Loki does so after racing to the hospital and saving Keller's daughter from poisoning (Loki's big car race is not that exciting, since the outcome is pretty much expected). Instead, Keller underestimates Holly who turns out to be responsible for the girls' abduction as well as numerous other serial killings. Keller ends up in that hole and my interpretation of the abrupt (but clever) ending, is that he WILL rescue Keller, and let him face the music.'Prisoners' indeed will drag you into its electrically-charged story and keep you at the edge of your seat to the end. The supporting players, those who play the wives and children of Keller and Franklin, do quite well, but are saddled by underdeveloped parts. Ultimately, you will have to overlook the red herrings and the main premise that the feeble (or perhaps not so feeble) Alex, will not crack under torture. I prefer to believe that he would, as most people would in that situation.",3,An exciting serial killer thriller but I had trouble believing torture victim wouldn't crack,1396137600,"03 30,

You were duped by the 5 star reviews.The only actor who partially survives this debacle is Maria Bello -- because her character takes tranquilizers and heads to bed, not to be seen for most of the movie, therefore she has no character development, no great dialog, and does not contribute in any way to story development -- and certainly not the climax of the film.And what's with Jake Gyllenhaal's raccoon eye make-up and nervous eyeball twitching?

It had been a long time since I'd seen a movie that battered my emotions quite as much as this one.For a basic plot summary, ""Prisoners"" opens on a typical Thanksgiving day in what just might be your (the viewers') neighborhood.  Instead of the normal revelry and family cheer, however, the daughters of Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) are kidnapped.  When detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) finds a very strange suspect (Paul Dano), it jump-starts the case in a terrifying direction that goes further into the realm of gritty reality than most films will show.I consider ""Prisoners"" to be one of the best films I've ever seen (I don't even want to put a genre to it, as that would be such a disservice to its breadth) because it is so perfect on both the plot and character levels.Plot-wise, it is a simple kidnapping story (one that has been utilized numerous times in cinema), yet director Dennis Villeneuve pushes its boundaries to the very max.  Just when you think you have the film pinned down, it manages to surprise you and go in another direction.  Yet, everything makes logical sense and feels ""real"" at the same time.That being said, the kidnapping plot itself (while brilliant) is not even the primary focus of the film.  Instead, it is the characters reactions to the events, making viewers ponder how we would react in similar situations.  The main focus here is on Dover and Loki, but each character adds a very specifically nuanced emotion to the overall mix.  The result is drama the likes of which is rarely seen (and sustained for nearly two and a half hours) on the big screen.I rarely watch a movie twice within the span of a year, but when ""Prisoners"" comes out to home video I will be snapping it up in an instant to watch with others who I know will appreciate the eerie genius of the experience.  I know that many, many more movies will be released between now and ""awards season"" (aka Academy Awards), but it would be a crying shame if this masterpiece isn't highly represented.  For the rest of the year, I'll be hard-pressed to see one better.",5,"A Simple Premise, Yet Oh So Complex Emotionally",1379721600,"09 21, 2013",2013,2300,"['viewing', 'Prisoners', 'opening', 'night', 'theater', 'couple', 'friends', 'turned', 'closing', 'credits', 'said', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'just', 'been', 'ten', 'round', 'prize', 'fight', 'had', 'been', 'long', 'time', ""'d"", 'seen', 'movie', 'battered', 'emotions', 'quite', 'as', 'much', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Prisoners', 'typical', 'Thanksgiving', 'day', 'what', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'viewers', 'neighborhood', 'Instead', 'normal', 'revelry', 'family', 'cheer', 'however', 'daughters', 'Keller', 'Dover', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Franklin', 'Birch', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'When', 'detective', 'Loki', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'very', 'strange', 'suspect', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'case', 'terrifying', 'direction', 'further', 'realm', 'gritty', 'reality', 'most', 'films', 'will', 'show.I', 'consider', 'Prisoners', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'put', 'genre', 'would', 'be', 'such', 'disservice', 'breadth', 'so', 'perfect', 'plot', 'character', 'levels.Plot-wise', 'simple', 'kidnapping', 'story', 'one', 'been', 'utilized', 'numerous', 'times', 'cinema', 'yet', 'director', 'Dennis', 'Villeneuve', 'boundaries', 'very', 'max', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'have', 'film', 'pinned', 'down', 'surprise', 'go', 'direction', 'everything', 'logical', 'sense', 'feels', 'real', 'same', 'being', 'said', 'kidnapping', 'plot', 'brilliant', 'not', 'even', 'primary', 'focus', 'film', 'Instead', 'characters', 'reactions', 'events', 'making', 'viewers', 'ponder', 'how', 'would', 'react', 'similar', 'situations', 'main', 'focus', 'here', 'Dover', 'Loki', 'character', 'very', 'specifically', 'nuanced', 'emotion', 'overall', 'mix', 'result', 'drama', 'likes', 'rarely', 'seen', 'sustained', 'nearly', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'big', 'screen.I', 'rarely', 'watch', 'movie', 'twice', 'span', 'year', 'when', 'Prisoners', 'out', 'home', 'video', 'will', 'be', 'snapping', 'up', 'instant', 'watch', 'others', 'who', 'know', 'will', 'appreciate', 'eerie', 'genius', 'experience', 'know', 'many', 'many', 'more', 'movies', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'now', 'awards', 'season', 'aka', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'would', 'be', 'crying', 'shame', 'masterpiece', ""n't"", 'highly', 'represented', 'rest', 'year', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hard-pressed', 'see', 'one', 'better']",N/A

Everything is done well.  The acting is perfect.  The character actions are realistic, believable, and enthralling.  The story just keeps piling on tension and mystery, making you wonder how facets fit together until the very end.Very disturbing.  Very creative.  With an excellent ending and a few nice twists.Sometimes, extreme measures are the right measures.  Especially when dealing with these types of criminals.  You will get a satisfying dose of violence--unfortunately tempered by the realities of our justice system and the ingenuity of evil human beings.This movie is a winner.  SEE IT NOW.  You will NOT regret it.",5,"Incredibly Moving, Incredibly Horrifying",1399852800,"05 12, 2014",2014,811,"['best', 'type', 'father', 'best', 'type', 'cop', 'worst', 'evil', 'plaguing', 'humanity', 'movie', 'three', 'together', 'heart-wrenching', 'tense', 'intelligent', 'thrilling', 'story', 'Everything', 'done', 'well', 'acting', 'perfect', 'character', 'actions', 'are', 'realistic', 'believable', 'enthralling', 'story', 'just', 'piling', 'tension', 'mystery', 'making', 'wonder', 'how', 'facets', 'fit', 'together', 'very', 'end.Very', 'disturbing', 'Very', 'creative', 'excellent', 'ending', 'few', 'nice', 'twists.Sometimes', 'extreme', 'measures', 'are', 'right', 'measures', 'Especially', 'when', 'dealing', 'types', 'criminals', 'will', 'get', 'satisfying', 'dose', 'violence', 'unfortunately', 'tempered', 'realities', 'justice', 'system', 'ingenuity', 'evil', 'human', 'beings.This', 'movie', 'winner', 'SEE', 'IT', 'NOW', 'will', 'NOT', 'regret']",N/A

I know of a lot of people who don't want to see it (my niece being one, because she's a new mom, and her daughter also named &#34;Anna.&#34;  So I don't blame her in the least).  But I loved everything about this movie.  Hugh's performance was gripping, heart wrenching, powerful, and very believable!  I loved the scene with him, and &#34;Loki&#34; in the car.  You can feel Hugh's rage when he starts yelling and pounding on the dashboard.  That alone, should win him an Oscar.",5,If this movie doesn't win an Oscar....,1389484800,"01 12, 2014",2014,561,"['movie', 'was', 'incredible', 'kept', 'guessing', 'edge', 'seat', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'niece', 'being', 'one', 'new', 'mom', 'daughter', 'also', 'named', '34', 'Anna.', '34', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'least', 'loved', 'everything', 'movie', 'Hugh', 'performance', 'was', 'gripping', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'powerful', 'very', 'believable', 'loved', 'scene', '34', 'Loki', '34', 'car', 'can', 'feel', 'Hugh', 'rage', 'when', 'yelling', 'pounding', 'dashboard', 'alone', 'should', 'win', 'Oscar']",N/A
