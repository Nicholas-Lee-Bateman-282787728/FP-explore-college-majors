Each time I see this movie I pick up something that I had not noticed before, a fact which makes this movie even more exciting.Angie Harmon is especially beautiful in this movie.  She adds a lot to the movie with her beauty and tremendous acting ability.  She has true talent, making the movie even more believable than it already is.  All the other actors add a tremendous amount of excitement and believability to the movie through their own efforts and tremendous talents.I do have to say that the acting pool for ""Video Voyeur"" is perfect.  No better actors could have been chosen to create this movie or to make it the great work that it is.  For the talent alone in this movie I would recommend it to anyone old enough to watch it.  It is a must!  Buy this video if you can, folks!  It is definitely worth your time!",5,One of the most interesting movies I have ever watched.,1280275200,"07 28, 2010",2010,933,"['have', 'idea', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'single', 'time', 'do', 'watch', 'time', 'see', 'movie', 'pick', 'up', 'something', 'had', 'not', 'noticed', 'fact', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'exciting.Angie', 'Harmon', 'especially', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'lot', 'movie', 'beauty', 'tremendous', 'acting', 'ability', 'true', 'talent', 'making', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'believable', 'already', 'other', 'actors', 'add', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'excitement', 'believability', 'movie', 'own', 'efforts', 'tremendous', 'talents.I', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'acting', 'pool', 'Video', 'Voyeur', 'perfect', 'better', 'actors', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'chosen', 'create', 'movie', 'make', 'great', 'work', 'talent', 'alone', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'old', 'enough', 'watch', 'must', 'Buy', 'video', 'can', 'folks', 'definitely', 'worth', 'time']",N/A

Her &#34;oh-so-friendly&#34; church-going neighbor has major boundary issues that reach far beyond his drop-by visits!  Although a well-respected elder in his church, this man has a dark side, and Susan finally realizes what is going on behind closed doors.  A wonderful movie with excellent actors.

The man accross the road and his wife were perverts and scum who spied on their neighbors using video camera's.

Susan was not going to sit there and do nothing, she stood up and made people who are doing these crimes accountable for them. This is a true story about a women who changed the law about video Voyeurs. And for those who may not know what Video Voyeur is it is the tapeing of your life, personal moments, sexual moments, and things to that effect with out your permission.

I think that most of us can relate to the main character and empathize with her family. It's horrible what happened to her and awful that she didnt have the community support that she deserved from the start of her attempts to get justice. Its sad that things like this have to happen before policymakers get certain laws on the books.

He hangs around and helps and is perhaps a little too fond of Susan Wilson (Angie Harmon). Eventually he develops that Eric Roberts creep to him as he plays his hand too soon. The first rule of peeping Tom is to pretend you know less about the victim than you do. Steve screws up and gets caught. What is fortunate for him is that the law is on his side, although it would seem filming children would come under child pornography even back in the 1990s.With the advent of micro and cell phone cameras, the voyeur tendency or ""visual rape"" as it is called has gotten out of control, with people being arrested in shopping malls standing at the escalators. Where does it end when people are given the technology to be voyeurs without being caught?It is an interesting film to say the least. It opens up a can of worms that society has trouble dealing with, that is, ourselves. Temptation and the ability to do wrong and get away with it will always lead to controversy and trouble.Parental Guide: Made for TV film. No nudity.
