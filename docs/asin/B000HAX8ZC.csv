But when the action happens, they don't hold back.  An interesting part of character development is Sunwoo's realization that he has to learn to use guns in order to take down his enemies.  For the first half of the movie he is all about fists until he is forced to pick up firearms when the number of his enemies greatly increases.  The ""love"" story was the only negative point for me.  He becomes infatuated with his boss' girlfriend, but she doesn't give him anything more then a glance and a smile during the whole movie.  His love for her was his downfall but she never reciprocated.  I would have liked to know more about Sunwoo's past. Maybe that would have given some insight as to why he was so taken by this girl.",3,"Violent, but with some thought to it.",1229472000,"12 17, 2008",2008,859,"['would', 'actually', 'give', '3.5', 'stars', '5', 'pretty', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'beat', 'head', 'violence', 'time', 'when', 'action', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back', 'interesting', 'part', 'character', 'development', 'Sunwoo', 'realization', 'learn', 'use', 'guns', 'order', 'take', 'down', 'enemies', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'fists', 'forced', 'pick', 'up', 'firearms', 'when', 'number', 'enemies', 'greatly', 'love', 'story', 'was', 'only', 'negative', 'point', 'infatuated', 'boss', 'girlfriend', ""n't"", 'give', 'anything', 'more', 'then', 'glance', 'smile', 'whole', 'movie', 'love', 'was', 'downfall', 'never', 'reciprocated', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'know', 'more', 'Sunwoo', 'past', 'Maybe', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'insight', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'taken', 'girl']",N/A
1011647,AYG1U47VFZ165,B000HAX8ZC,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[3, 3]","I knew I'd seen Byung-hun Lee before.  He starred as ""Storm Shadow"" in G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA, and, with what little he was given in that tent-pole summer film from director Stephen Sommers, he did a masterful job, so much so that I knew I'd see him again.  Little did I expect that it would be in a film he had done before G.I. JOE, back in 2005's A BITTERSWEET LIFE.Despite its more popular conventions, LIFE is a bit of a puzzle.  It's one part gangster film (if you learn anything from reading this review, I beg you to please take away from it the fact that many Eastern nations do gang films exceedingly well).  It's equal part suspense/thriller.  It's two parts romance (Eastern films about gangs tend to treat gangsterism with a high degree of romantic images, and LIFE is no different, but the backstory involves as unique a love triangle as you'll see in any genuine period piece).  It's cinematic eye candy with deep dark noir visuals and stark images of violence and brutality.  It's good versus evil in a kind of funny ""evil versus more evil"" way.  Also, to my surprise, it's a bit of existential melancholy, a rumination on life and how one gets to the dynamic crossroads one faces given the choices we make, and that I didn't expect.So, the real question is, ""Does it all mesh well?""There's no doubt in my mind that LIFE's writer/director Jee-woon Kim does fascinating work.  All one need do is take a look at his 2003 film, A TALE OF TWO SISTERS (while I found parts of it a bit uneven, it's as great as a modern ghost story as you'll find anywhere on film); his use of character and images move the story along in a way few directors grasp.  Also, if you can get your hands on a copy of THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE WEIRD, you'll be as stunned and as shocked as I was to see what a visually commanding grasp of a Western (that's right! A rip-roaring, shoot-`em-up Wild Western! Done by a Korean!) as you'll see on screens anywhere ever.  Jee-woom Kim has exceptional skills as a storyteller, and A BITTERSWEET LIFE, while a bit uneven like I found his TWO SISTERS film, is a handy addition to the man's resume as an artist.  He puts a unique, crisp stamp on visuals, and he directs actors and actresses in such a way as to groom only the best contributions out of their work.Still, the question remains, ""Does it all mesh well?""In my opinion, LIFE is not Jee-woon Kim's best work to date - I think that distinction really stands, by far, with THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE WEIRD - but it's a very close second.  The film feels very much like two distinctly identifiable pieces, broken in half by the violence the main character unwittingly brings upon himself.  The first half the film is a slick gangster saga sprinkled with hints of a romance, and the second half is that existential meditation on the lives lived by the corrupt cast of characters.  Imagine, if you can, that the blazing gunfights are snapped up with meditative introspection wherein the gunmen stop, turn to the camera, and ask, ""Why are we using guns?"" or ""Why did we decide to shoot at each other?""  It's a jarring moment of realization, especially for a film predicated on violence and the exploration of its consequences, but it's clearly what the writer/director wanted.  (Take heed: it never literally happens in such an obvious fashion.  If you've seen the film, I think you can understand the metaphor.  If you haven't seen the film, then you may not find it as obvious or as borderline distracting as I did.)This isn't to say that it's a bad or lesser technique.  I think it all goes to a matter of taste, that I can describe better with my dislike for the Spider-man films.  Those flicks by Sam Raimi are lovingly made, but my problem with them comes with the fact that, for my tastes, they spend too much time with the mildly whiney Peter Parker.  When I go to the movies, I want a hero who's going to save the day, not a hero who's going to spend 45 minutes ruminating over how life is unfair and why can't anyone else rise up and save the damsel and why does it always have to me?  There are hints of that same characterization tied in to LIFE's central character, Sun-woo, but under Jee-woon Kim's direction, they are far subtler than a mainstream superhero action picture would allow.With Eastern influences being what they are in film, there's equal strength to some of the unstated conflict; as these films are clearly made outside of the Americanized studio system where every element is scrutinized beyond necessity.  As a consequence, I find that these particular foreign films maintain a truer sense of purpose because they can be more `raw' in style and treatment.  (No, I'm not talking about buckets of blood!  I'm talking about the thematic approach employed by the director.)  They have greater complexity because some of what these characters do may NOT be in their own best interest.  Everyone trapped within A BITTERSWEET LIFE is living two lives, really.  One is the public face that everyone else believes they are, but then, when the lights are dimmed, they're someone slightly different, and it's when these less public images surface that the fires ignite, the guns are pulled, and the real drama begins.Cleverly, LIFE follows that same structure: what you think you're getting is not necessarily what you find yourself with at the end ... and I think that's the most `bittersweet' moment of them all.",4,"A Genuinely ""Bittersweet"" Film",1302480000,"04 11, 2011",2011,5413,"['knew', ""'d"", 'seen', 'Byung-hun', 'Lee', 'starred', 'Storm',

This is one of them, but I plan on buying this particular DVD. After reading several reviews of this film, I decided to rent it at my local video store. Some of the reviewers such as Jenny J.J.I, K. Jones and Woopak have given excellent reviews of this film, and I would recommend others to take a look at those reviews. I have recently run the gamut in viewing different genres of film as of late. From the Korean drama ""The Way Home,"" to the Japanese romantic comedy ""Train Man,"" and now this very violent, but highly recommended revenge film from Korea.""A Bittersweet Life,"" was directed by Kim Ji-woon, and stars (Lee Byung-hun) as the character Sun-woo. Sun-woo is one vicious killer, and as the right hand man of a mob boss named Kang, (Kim Yeong-Chul) his job is to make those who displease his boss vanish. And he is very effective as the bosses enforcer. The life of Sun-woo is one of a world of violence. And in this life of violence where Sun-woo lives in there can be no mistakes. There are no second chances. Moreover, the consequences of making one can be fatal. However, we all make mistakes, and as such, so does Sun-woo. I don't wish to spoil this film for you, however, I will write that Lee Byung-hun gives a riveting performance in his role, and this is an excellent film.Mr. Kang, has sent Sun-woo on an important mission: Find out if his mistress is cheating on him, and if so, take care of things. Does he? I won't give out details of the film that will ruin it for you, however, expect a lot of violence, as Sun-woo refuses to bend to Mr. Kang, and must endure one hell of an ordeal. End of film? No way! Sun-woo's revenge after what he endures at the hands of his Mr. Kang's minions veers the film into one violent crime drama. [But then it already was in the beginning] This is a dark world Sun-woo lives in, and so is his occupation, and as such the film delivers more than its share of violent scenes. I thought the film was great, and especially the cinematography. The ending as pointed out by others is different, but effective I believe. Sun-woo's life truly is bittersweet! This is a very good crime-noir film. Highly recommended.

""A New Yorker""","[16, 17]","In the same vein as ""Oldboy"" comes ""A Bittersweet Life,"" a movie so good it shocked me when watching it for the first time. It's a violent revenge movie with a gripping story with some fantastic actors such as Byung-hun Lee. He stars as Seon-woo, an enforcer for President Kang, a very dangerous man and if he wants to get rid of people, Seon-woo is the one taking care of it. The most interesting thing about this movie besides the story being so great is Seon-woo himself. The way Byung-hun Lee has captured the character sure tells that he's a great actor and what's keeping the movie alive from beginning to end. Seon-woo seem to know nothing about what it's like to have a ""normal"" life, as the world he lives in is only filled with evil and violence. He has a hard front, can be violent and nasty without remorse, but its fairly easy to see through all that and see that he has a gentle side as well, and that makes him interesting.For instance with all the violence going on in the movie it sometimes seems like he has no conscience and couldn't care less about what happens to other people. His face is like stone with no expressions to reveal what he really feels, if anything. But at the same time you know that there's something more underneath it all, like when he's around the mistress you really get to see that there's more than one side to him, and that makes him a really likable character. Actually, the further the movie goes, the more likable he becomes and you can't help but feeling sorry for him which is a really effective part of the overall experience.As reviewer K. Jones has put it, this movie does mixes violence and emotions in an excellent way, and even if the violence is a bit too brutal at times, you still have a lot of ""nice"" things to fall back on. There are a lot of action elements and the movie is quite stylish to say the least, but the most important thing is that it's not the least bit shallow and while its entertaining eye candy at times; you still really care about the characters and what's going on. This is easily one of the best Korean movies I've seen this year, and a movie that I will probably enjoy watching many times in the future. If you're a fan of ""Oldboy,"" you're most likely to find ""A Bittersweet Life"" to be pretty sweet, both dealing with the concept of revenge but very different from each other.

I'm Kind Of A ...","[5, 7]","I just can't get enough of these Korean revenge films because they're just so different and unique from your normal revenge plot. Now of course a film like this or one of the films from Park Chan-wook's ""Vengeance trilogy"" won't be appreciated by all simply because some may think they go to far with the amount of violence. It really depends on what your limit is but I had no problem with any of these films.Sun-woo is a mob enforcer and a darn good one, as you'll see in the beginning. While eating desert in the restaurant he manages Sun-woo is alerted that there is a disturbance downstairs. Sun-woo quickly grabs someone (Min-gi) to help handle the situation. Three men are refusing to leave so Sun-woo tells them they have three seconds to leave and starts counting down. When he gets to 1 he tells Min-gi to lock the door. It's a little hard to explain what happens after the door is locked but let's just say Sun-woo handles the situation.  Sun-woo has been working for his boss Kang for seven years and has not made a mistake in all those years but everyone makes a mistake at least once in their life. Being in the mob he knows that he can't mess up but what happens is something that he couldn't help.Come to find out the three men Sun-woo beat up were men from a rival mob family. This was not Sun-woo's only problem; actually this situation only provides half of the story's plot. While avoiding to talk to the boss of the rival family Sun-woo is asked to do something important for his boss. Kang has a mistress (Hee-soo) and suspects that she is seeing another man. Because of the age difference Kang believes that she is tired of him and is seeing a younger man. He asks Sun-woo to watch her for three days while he is away on business. Not only does he have to watch her but also he has to drive her and basically be attached to her hip. If he does find that she is seeing someone else Sun-woo is to either call Kang or take care of it himself. Sun-woo starts to fall for the girl and when he finds that she was unfaithful he can't finish the job.After all this Sun-woo is caught by the rival family and that's when the good stuff starts. The film just goes crazy, after a few events I won't tell cause I don't want to spoil the film but after them Sun-woo goes on a revenge spree. No matter how bad the pain gets Sun-woo refuses to say sorry or show any remorse for any of the things he's done. He won't stop until he sees the situation to the end and let me tell you he definitely does. For the rest of the film it gets very nasty and bloody for Sun-woo and the men that have wronged him.I was amazed to see Lee Byung-Hun (Addicted, Everybody Has Secrets) in this film, he did great fight sequences and just an overall perfect performance. The acting in this film was great, very realistic and believable but not over the top. The settings and picture were beautiful, great camera work and very good sound quality. I liked that Sun-woo felt like a real person. At the end when he confronts everyone he seems like a person that has been very hurt and insulted over the reasons he's been attacked. I didn't really see any flaws in A Bittersweet Life but some people will for their own reasons, which I do understand. I do hope that nobody takes this film as trying to bite off of Chan-wook's trilogy because you'll miss out. It's definitely not as complex as the trilogy but at the same time it has its own style and feel to it. Anyone that just wants to see a good film with a simple plot then I definitely encourage you to see this.",5,His Life Really Is Bittersweet,1175126400,"03 29, 2007",2007,3552,"['just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'Korean', 'revenge', 'films', ""'re"", 'just', 'so', 'different', 'unique', 'normal', 'revenge', 'plot', 'Now', 'course', 'film', 'one', 'films', 'Park', 'Chan-wook', 'Vengeance', 'trilogy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'appreciated', 'simply', 'may', 'think', 'go', 'far', 'amount', 'violence', 'really', 'what', 'limit', 'had', 'problem', 'films.Sun-woo', 'mob', 'enforcer', 'darn', 'good', 'one', ""'ll"", 'see', 'beginning', 'eating', 'desert', 'restaurant', 'Sun-woo', 'alerted', 'disturbance', 'downstairs', 'Sun-woo', 'quickly', 'grabs', 'someone', 'Min-gi', 'help', 'handle', 'situation', 'Three', 'men', 'are', 'refusing', 'leave', 'so', 'Sun-woo', 'tells', 'have', 'three', 'seconds', 'leave', 'counting', 'down', 'When', '1', 'Min-gi', 'lock', 'door', 'little', 'hard', 'explain', 'what', 'door', 'locked', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'Sun-woo', 'handles', 'situation', 'Sun-woo', 'been', 'working', 'boss', 'Kang', 'seven', 'years', 'not', 'made', 'mistake', 'years', 'everyone', 'mistake', 'least', 'once', 'life', 'Being', 'mob', 'ca', ""n't"", 'mess', 'up', 'what', 'something', 'could', ""n't"", 'help.Come', 'find', 'out', 'three', 'men', 'Sun-woo', 'beat', 'up', 'were', 'men', 'rival', 'mob', 'family', 'was', 'not', 'Sun-woo', 'only', 'problem', 'actually', 'situation', 'only', 'half', 'story', 'plot', 'avoiding', 'talk', 'boss', 'rival', 'family', 'Sun-woo', 'asked', 'do', 'something', 'important', 'boss', 'Kang', 'mistress', 'Hee-soo', 'seeing', 'man', 'age', 'difference', 'Kang', 'tired', 'seeing', 'younger', 'man', 'Sun-woo', 'watch', 'three', 'days', 'away', 'business', 'Not', 'only', 'have', 'watch', 'also', 'drive', 'basically', 'be', 'attached', 'hip', 'find', 'seeing', 'someone', 'else', 'Sun-woo', 'call', 'Kang', 'take', 'care', 'Sun-woo', 'starts', 'fall', 'girl', 'when', 'was', 'unfaithful', 'ca', ""n't"", 'finish', 'job.After', 'Sun-woo', 'caught', 'rival', 'family', 'when', 'good', 'stuff', 'starts', 'film', 'just', 'crazy', 'few', 'events', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'cause', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'film', 'Sun-woo', 'revenge', 'spree', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'pain', 'Sun-woo', 'refuses', 'say', 'sorry', 'show', 'remorse', 'things', 'done', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'situation', 'end', 'let', 'tell', 'definitely', 'rest', 'film', 'very', 'nasty', 'bloody', 'Sun-woo', 'men', 'have', 'wronged', 'him.I', 'was', 'amazed', 'see', 'Lee', 'Byung-Hun', 'Addicted', 'Everybody', 'Has', 'Secrets', 'film', 'did', 'great', 'fight', 'sequences', 'just', 'overall', 'perfect', 'performance', 'acting', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'very', 'realistic', 'believable', 'not', 'top', 'settings', 'picture', 'were', 'beautiful', 'great', 'camera', 'work', 'very', 'good', 'sound', 'quality', 'liked', 'Sun-woo', 'felt', 'real', 'person', 'end', 'when', 'everyone', 'person', 'been', 'very', 'hurt', 'insulted', 'reasons', 'been', 'attacked', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'flaws', 'A', 'Bittersweet', 'Life', 'people', 'will', 'own', 'reasons', 'do', 'understand', 'do', 'hope', 'nobody', 'film', 'trying', 'bite', 'Chan-wook', 'trilogy', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'out', 'definitely', 'not', 'as', 'complex', 'trilogy', 'same', 'time', 'own', 'style', 'feel', 'Anyone', 'just', 'see', 'good', 'film', 'simple', 'plot', 'then', 'definitely', 'encourage', 'see']",N/A

Do they even give them a chance? Personally I don't mind watching a subtitled movie - it combines two of my favourite things, reading and movies, what's not to like? Most of the time you don't even realise you're reading, you get so used to it.Bittersweet Life is the latest subtitled movie I've watched, and I spent most of it wincing, turning away from the screen, or holding my breath.The story revolves around a young man, Sun-Woo, who is manager of his restaurant, but is also an errand boy it seems for an underworld boss, with lots of fingers in pies. When the boss goes away for a week, Sunwoo is given the task of making sure the boss' much younger girlfriend isn't cheating. If she is, she's to die, as is her bit on the side. Of course, she's cheating, but Sun-Woo can't bring himself to kill her, as he has a little crush on her. So he lets her escape, on the promise she won't see the guy again.From here, it escalates, and I did lose it for quite a while, but I was still drawn into the dark world, where everyone is backstabbing everyone else. Obviously the boss finds out she was cheating, and that Sun-Woo did not do as he was instructed, and the film just goes into scene after scene of endless, brutal violence, which will leave you breathless. And each scene is worse than the previous. If you think you've seen violence up until now, you ain't seen nothing yet.Bittersweet Life is one of those amazing movies, that has to be seen, and the twist at the end is on the one hand a brilliant ending, but on the other end a very disappointing ending. You have to watch it, and I did need it explained to me (ooops, sorry!), but once I realised what was going on, I did find it quite disappointing. But it's still an amazing ending, I think my jaw did actually drop on the floor!This definitely needs to be picked up and if you're one of those annoying people who doesn't watch subtitled movies because you have to ""read"", start.

1011654,A2BON03VAFS1SZ,B000HAX8ZC,Michael Fishman,"[3, 3]","When I finished watching Dalkomhan Insaeng one of my first thoughts was where are the American filmmakers who are making movies like this? If this movie had been made here, which it never would/could, my guess is there would have been a dozen cars blown up, a city destroyed, a billion additional bullets fired, a gratuitous sex scene, a blazingly loud techno-rock score, an eye toward high fashion and merchandise tie-ins and an ending that was overly sentimental and unrealistic. When it was over people would have commented that Bruce Willis was getting a little too old for these types of roles and life would go on and the movie would be forgotten. Life still goes on, but hopefully A Bittersweet Life will get wider recognition and notice.Sun-woo is an enforcer for the mob who receives a simple assignment from his boss: watch his much younger girlfriend while he leaves town because he's suspicious that she might be seeing someone else. If Sun-woo discovers that the girlfriend is cheating, his instructions are to kill both the girlfriend and her lover. In the meantime, a rival gang is trying to move in on Sun-woo's boss' territory and its Sun-woo's job to deal with that. Sun-woo finds himself enjoying the company of the woman he's been told to watch and maybe kill. A master of martial arts, Sun-woo soon finds himself in need of a gun. That's a very, very small thumbnail sketch; the plot is much deeper and intricate than that.The writer and director filled the movie with obvious nods to Taxi Driver, Kill Bill, Sam Peckinpah and probably others that I didn't get, but what sealed the fact in my mind that this was a magnificent crime drama was the character depth of Sun-woo. Maybe I'm wrong, but in a lot of movies we have heroes who are bad guys doing bad things for good reasons and because they're doing something good it's all okay. Dalkomhan Insaeng we have a hero who's a bad guy doing bad things for pretty much bad reasons and you can't help but care for him and feel for him because he wants to do the right things, but, for reasons, can't. In many movies characters seek revenge for a wrongdoing, but never that I've ever seen on the level of this movie, and I don't mean physically, but emotionally.I think the ending of the movie was just brilliant icing on a flawless cake and about as close to a perfect ending as I can imagine for the movie. Even the movie's imagery (stuff that usually goes over my head) worked and didn't seem forced or pretentious and it added to the overall beauty. Add to all of that a wonderful acting job by Byung-hun Lee and this is top-notch movie-making and entertainment.The movie is in Korean with English subtitles.

Pretty well, as it turns out.The film is about a mob enforcer who has to watch after his bosses young lover, while he is away. He is informed that he must kill her, and her other lover, if she is found to have one.Well, she does have one, and the enforcer can't bring himself to off her. Which sets in motion a lot of bad things to happen to him. Of course, being an unstoppable mob enforcer, he's not going to take that lying down, now is he?You get the picture. The film starts up pretty slow paced, and somewhat artsy. It did remind me of ATOTS, and I was wondering if this guy had it him to make a more hard edged film. Well, obviously he was just setting a mood, because things do get quite violent, and action packed. There's also a moderate amount of humor(normal and dark).I found the film to be quite good, and I was very impressed with it. It really impresses me how some of these South Korean films I have seen, such as The Host and Oldboy, will take a pretty cliched concept, and really take an artistic spin on it.

1011659,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B000HAX8ZC,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[11, 11]","A  BITTERSWEET LIFE is a dazzling neo-noir gangster film from director Kim Jae-woon(A Tale of Two Sisters).  It is a pretty much a perfect example on how to follow the basics in making an entertaining gangster film, like the old adage goes: "" If it ain't broke, don't fix it"". It may not have the most original plot in existence, but believe me; it works. The film is terrific; Revenge has never looked so darned Good!Sun-woo(Lee Byung Hun, J.S.A.) is an impeccably dressed enforcer for a notorious crimelord called Kang(Kim Yeong-Chul). Sun-woo is instructed to to watch over his mistress Hee-Soo( Beautiful Shin Min-ah, Volcano High) to find out if she's making whoopee with another man. His orders are crystal clear: if he catches her cheating on Kang with another man, he is to contact Kang at once or finish them off himself.The plot takes off when Sun-woo does catch her with her lover and as an act of mercy, he decides to let them both live. (On the condition they stop their affair) This gesture of pity brings a world of pain onto Sun-woo as the entire organization sets its goals to punishing him for his ""act of betrayal"". Beaten, bloodied and kicked out of the gang, Sun-woo survives the brutal ordeal. Sun-woo embarks on a brutal, bloody trail of vengeance from which no one is likely to survive, each kill brings him closer to a final confrontation with Kang. But a strange fact remains; Sun-woo has been a faithful servant to Kang for years, why would he suddenly have a change of heart? (it wasn't something as simple as love or lust, although lust may have played a small part at their meeting )""A Bittersweet Life"" is a beautiful, wholly engaging cinematic masterpiece. It blends the ""hardboiled cool"" of classic film noir with highly stylized action reminicent of a John Woo film. (But not overly stylized like Woo's films)Before Sun-Woo decides to ignore his boss's orders we watch as he slowly comes to an epiphany. However, we're not quite privy to the depth of this realization until the final scene of the film, in which everything that has come before soon makes simple, perfect sense.  The film becomes a visceral, wall-to wall action film when Sun-woo goes against Kang; the carnage goes to overdrive. The movie is also very cool and fresh; with nice touches, like a quiet moment wherein Sun-woo placidly savors a slice of chocolate cake before `going to work', adds a load of style, at the same time sets a moody atmosphere.As brutally, violent this film is, it's quite refreshing that the filmmakers didn't lose their sense of humor.  To its credit, the film pitches in its share of comedic moments in the screenplay with all the blood and gore. A Bittersweet Life can be oddly funny at times with its share of cleverly paced moments of black humor.Lee Byung-hun does a very convincing job in his portrayal of Sun-woo's character. The actor brings a certain depth and dynamic charisma to his anti-hero role, which is very impressive when we consider that a fully-realized characterization of Sun-woo hampered by the fact that his motivations MUST NOT be revealed until the film's climax. Even so, Lee conveys a sense of his character's life, even if it isn't something readily apparent by the script. Viewers will have to also take into account that the film is a (Sunwoo's)character study (of sorts) of a person who lived most of his life in the shadow of violence which in turn may make one an empty shell. The things that most people may take forgranted may be considered so ""fulfilling"" to someone with Sun-woo's life.I have the (Region-3, Korean release) 2- DISC Director's cut of  A Bittersweet Life that clocks in at about 122 minutes. I cannot make a statement how it differs from the Theatrical cut since I haven't seen the ""shorter"" cut of the film in theaters.PICTURE: 2.35 Anamorphic Widescreen. The transfer is very decent but not without a few flaws. There is a small amount of grain in some scenes and some heavy edge enhancements. On the plus side, it does have nice colors, accurate skin tones and strong (but detailed)black levels. Overall, still a good transfer.AUDIO: Korean 6.1 DTS-ES, 6.1 Dolby Digital, 2.0 surround language mix. If you're equipped, the DTS track is the way to go as it provides intense and immersive listening experience that really brings the action and gunplay to life. The 6.1 Dolby digital is not bad, but it does have a lower bass level. The English subtitles are clean and clear, very easy to read.EXTRAS; COMMENTARIES/Interviews, Making of feature, Set/production designs, ""CANNES Film Festival Footage""..many more.IN CLOSING:A Bittersweet Life is a visual and aural feast for its audience. Beautifully shot, some folks may find it superficial. Thankfully, that impression actually seems to be based on how the film is made, as everything is meant to build towards the film's conclusion in which the TRUE  motivation behind Sun-woo's quest for revenge is revealed. Quite visceral, sometimes lyrical and even comical, ""A Bittersweet Life"" is a complete cinematic experience and contains a climax to bring it to a ""bittersweet"" close. To sum it up, it is magnificent!A BITTERSWEET LIFE is among my top 25 favorite films. ( I have 600 dvds)HIGHEST Possible RECOMMENDATION!!
