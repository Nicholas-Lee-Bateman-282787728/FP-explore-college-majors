Suzanne Cook is an easy to follow instructor and if you listen to her cues and get the form down, you WILL feel the results of these exercises. It's definitely a wonderful supplement to an existing cardio routine, or even by itself, every day or every other day. The great part is the alternate levels for all of the moves, based on your needs, to get the most challenge for your ability. I highly recommend Lotte Berk. While I've heard commentary that it's not a difficult enough workout, if done properly, has even better results than you'd ever expect. Even more cool, is the fact that ALL of their routines can be done barefoot, with no equipment, in a minimum of time.

If you concentrate on truly holding your abs in, your breathing, and your form, this DVD is truly amazing.

While none of them have the scary 6 pack abs found on female body builders, they all have shapes to be envious of, and Barbara? The woman held the plank pose the entire time! I was shaking the first time I did it after 30 seconds.  If you want the streamlined dancer's look, and the sleek, hard abs of someone with core strength, this is for you.

739073,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00008DDVP,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[35, 37]","The Lotte Berk Method is a form of exercise developed by Russian dancer Lotte Berk and brought to America by Lydia Bach. Drawing from dance and other similar disciplines, many of the exercises require the use of a ballet barre, and the focus is on making small, precise movements to facilitate the development of long, lean muscles. Unlike the other videos in this series, however, the movements in Hip Hugger Abs, which work the abdominal area, are performed entirely on the floor without the use of a barre.Like all of the Lotte Berk videos, this workout begins with high knee lifts to warm up. Instructor Suzanne Cook leads two other Lotte Berk instructors, one of whom shows modifications.  Also included in the warm up are push-ups: 2 sets of 10 on your knees, and then 2 sets of 10 ""reverse"" push-ups, performed with your hands behind you and your chest up to switch the work to the triceps. After the warm up, the workout moves to the floor.  Starting in a seated position with your knees bent, you lean back, tilting your pelvis, pulling in your abdominals, and holding a sort of isometric contraction.  You perform several repetitions and also several variations, such as holding one leg in the air.  By the end of this segment, I could definitely feel my abs working!Next comes a series of Pilates inspired movements.  Beginning on your back, you lift your bent legs in the air and dip your toes to the ground; you then perform the same movement with straight legs.  Moving on to your side, you do a single set of side leg lifts, and to finish, it's on to your stomach for a few brief holds of elbow plank.  Although all of the above are effective movements, I don't think that enough time was devoted to the individual exercises, and I didn't feel very worked out after this segment.  The workout ends as all the LBM videos do with a ""Shape by Stretch"" section in which you perform several different stretches to finish at a total of 26 1/2 minutes.  While there are certainly some merits to this video, better abs and Pilates workouts are available.",3,"Small, isolated movements target the abdominal area",1110844800,"03 15, 2005",2005,2061,"['Lotte', 'Berk', 'Method', 'form', 'exercise', 'developed', 'Russian', 'dancer', 'Lotte', 'Berk', 'brought', 'America', 'Lydia', 'Bach', 'Drawing', 'dance', 'other', 'similar', 'disciplines', 'many', 'exercises', 'require', 'use', 'ballet', 'barre', 'focus', 'making', 'small', 'precise', 'movements', 'facilitate', 'development', 'long', 'lean', 'muscles', 'other', 'videos', 'series', 'however', 'movements', 'Hip', 'Hugger', 'Abs', 'work', 'abdominal', 'area', 'are', 'performed', 'entirely', 'floor', 'use', 'barre.Like', 'Lotte', 'Berk', 'videos', 'workout', 'high', 'knee', 'lifts', 'warm', 'up', 'Instructor', 'Suzanne', 'Cook', 'two', 'other', 'Lotte', 'Berk', 'instructors', 'one', 'whom', 'shows', 'modifications', 'Also', 'included', 'warm', 'up', 'are', 'push-ups', '2', 'sets', '10', 'knees', 'then', '2', 'sets', '10', 'reverse', 'push-ups', 'performed', 'hands', 'chest', 'up', 'switch', 'work', 'triceps', 'warm', 'up', 'workout', 'floor', 'Starting', 'seated', 'position', 'knees', 'bent', 'lean', 'back', 'tilting', 'pelvis', 'pulling', 'abdominals', 'holding', 'sort', 'isometric', 'contraction', 'perform', 'several', 'repetitions', 'also', 'several', 'variations', 'such', 'holding', 'one', 'leg', 'air', 'end', 'segment', 'could', 'definitely', 'feel', 'abs', 'working', 'Next', 'series', 'Pilates', 'inspired', 'movements', 'Beginning', 'back', 'lift', 'bent', 'legs', 'air', 'dip', 'toes', 'ground', 'then', 'perform', 'same', 'movement', 'straight', 'legs', 'Moving', 'side', 'do', 'single', 'set', 'side', 'leg', 'lifts', 'finish', 'stomach', 'few', 'brief', 'elbow', 'plank', 'above', 'are', 'effective', 'movements', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'enough', 'time', 'was', 'devoted', 'individual', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'very', 'worked', 'out', 'segment', 'workout', 'LBM', 'videos', 'do', 'Shape', 'Stretch', 'section', 'perform', 'several', 'different', 'stretches', 'finish', 'total', '26', '1/2', 'minutes', 'are', 'certainly', 'merits', 'video', 'better', 'abs', 'Pilates', 'workouts', 'are', 'available']",N/A

739080,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00008DDVP,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[5, 5]","Three instructors guide you through an intermediate workout complete with modifications for three levels of fitness. Beginners and intermediate exercisers will enjoy this the most and advanced students may feel like they are taking too many breaks between repetitions. This is because the workout is set up in two segments. The first section is simply the ""method"" or training session.The real workout begins when you look under the ""special features."" This is the workout at a speed where you will burn calories and workout at an intermediate to advanced level. So, this is truly for all fitness levels after the first workout.The exercises are based very simply on Pilates and Yoga and you will enjoy this the most if you are intermediate in both. Push ups are normal, but it is the challenging plank where your arm strength will be tested.The stretching session at the end isn't quite long enough so you might want to follow this with a yoga practice that focuses on stretching and relaxing. The exercises are all very structured and you can feel these exercises mostly in the abdominal/hip area with some exercises focusing on the arms and legs along with the abs. Unlike most strict Pilates routines, you won't be doing an extended side series and the Yoga postures are uncomplicated.If you are intermediate, you may want to walk or bike for over 30 minutes before starting this routine. I felt like I burned more calories when I was already warmed up and this workout then presented more of a challenge.The reason I think this is intermediate is because of the strength I know it takes to get to the exercises they expect you to complete. The plank is held for quite some time and the roll ups take quite a lot of time to master. This is a little beyond beginner, but you can work your way into intermediate over time.~The Rebecca Review",3,Intermediate Lotte Berk Method,1155600000,"08 15, 2006",2006,1843,"['Three', 'instructors', 'guide', 'intermediate', 'workout', 'complete', 'modifications', 'three', 'levels', 'fitness', 'Beginners', 'intermediate', 'exercisers', 'will', 'enjoy', 'most', 'advanced', 'students', 'may', 'feel', 'are', 'taking', 'too', 'many', 'breaks', 'repetitions', 'workout', 'set', 'up', 'two', 'segments', 'first', 'section', 'simply', 'method', 'training', 'session.The', 'real', 'workout', 'when', 'look', 'special', 'features', 'workout', 'speed', 'where', 'will', 'burn', 'calories', 'workout', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'level', 'So', 'truly', 'fitness', 'levels', 'first', 'workout.The', 'exercises', 'are', 'based', 'very', 'simply', 'Pilates', 'Yoga', 'will', 'enjoy', 'most', 'are', 'intermediate', 'Push', 'ups', 'are', 'normal', 'challenging', 'plank', 'where', 'arm', 'strength', 'will', 'be', 'tested.The', 'stretching', 'session', 'end', ""n't"", 'quite', 'long', 'enough', 'might', 'want', 'follow', 'yoga', 'practice', 'stretching', 'relaxing', 'exercises', 'are', 'very', 'structured', 'can', 'feel', 'exercises', 'mostly', 'abdominal/hip', 'area', 'exercises', 'focusing', 'arms', 'legs', 'abs', 'most', 'strict', 'Pilates', 'routines', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'doing', 'extended', 'side', 'series', 'Yoga', 'postures', 'are', 'uncomplicated.If', 'are', 'intermediate', 'may', 'want', 'walk', 'bike', '30', 'minutes', 'starting', 'routine', 'felt', 'burned', 'more', 'calories', 'when', 'was', 'already', 'warmed', 'up', 'workout', 'then', 'presented', 'more', 'challenge.The', 'reason', 'think', 'intermediate', 'strength', 'know', 'get', 'exercises', 'expect', 'complete', 'plank', 'held', 'quite', 'time', 'roll', 'ups', 'take', 'quite', 'lot', 'time', 'master', 'little', 'beginner', 'can', 'work', 'way', 'intermediate', 'time.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A

She gently chided you if she suspected you were getting sloppy: ""Keep the integrity of your form, because they're not sloppy.""Uhm, this ab work leaves Burr Leonard (The Bar Method) in the dust. I've never seen some of the exercises and my abs let me know it right away. These are incredible. Some are just plain freaking scary ... *cry* but I loved every minute of it. If you buy the 4-pack, this one alone is worth the price of the pack. I do this one every day after whatever workout I do in the pack. I alternate Lotte Berk with Bar Method but I make sure either this workout or the HHA Bonus Blast is done every day and I have people in my office coming over to touch my abs. They are ROCK HARD. It's that wonderful. There are 3 modifications shown for the workouts here and each one could be done by us, depending upon how strong we're feeling or crampy or ambitious we are.Barbara (the most advanced instructor) is really scary in this one. She kept the plank held even through the rests and she never trembled once. Perfect form, perfect posture, strong and muscular body.I'll say the easiest exercise was the Lotte style situps and that's saying something.The Bonus Blast is going to be humbling if you're not extremely fit. Be warned. It is grit tough and maddeningly horrifying, lol. At first, you just collapse and stare at her as if she's some kind of demon woman. But somehow, you force yourself back up into position and pick it up and keep going. Your legs won't be as high as hers, your back won't be as straight but each time you do it, your form will improve to the point at which you smile happily when you realize, ""OMG, I'm DOING IT!""The Bonus Blast is only about 10 minutes, but you're working hard the entire time. Again, there is no easing in, especially on the Bonus Blasts. You get straight to business and isn't that what you want when you don't have a lot of time for chatter in DVDs?I love these kinds of exercises and am happy that I bought the 4-pack because there are 4 DVDs -- I have a very nice rotation now and am even more motivated now to keep pushing forward! Hooray!One other thing: If you've been doing The Bar Method or Callanetics, you will be very well prepared for the Lotte Berk  workouts. If you don't have that background, don't worry. There is a beginner DVD/tape. If you start with this one, you just may collapse from the shaking, trembling and sweating. LOL! And strangely you'll feel really good about it because every muscle in your body will feel worked and you'll also be strangely relaxed.The abs are notoriously difficult to sculpt and they resist overtraining but if you're watching your diet and you are religious with your workouts, you will see them begin to appear. You really will.
