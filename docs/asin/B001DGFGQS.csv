I didn't realize how badly they'd been screwed over by unscrupulous management, but not surprising as it seemed pretty common back in those days.

1180319,A3FHN6AIATT19K,B001DGFGQS,James Zinn,"[13, 14]","This video is a documentary of The Animals and Eric Burdon's bands after the Animals broke up, up to and including War.There are quite a few interesting interviews and commentary but all the music contained herein is all just short clips.At least they mostly interview people relevant to the story, mostly Eric Burdon in a really laid back way.  There are also interview clips with Chas Chandler, Alan Price, etc., but the appearances of Sammy Hagar is awkward & out of place.  I guess since he says he saw them at Monterey it has some relevance.Very interesting stories about the Animals days, especially touring England on one bus with Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry, who apparently were not very compatible touring partners, to put it nicely.  That story is a hoot.  Also who knew that ""House Of The Rising Sun"" was done in one take, and their management (Michael Jeffries of Jimi Hendrix fame)and producer Mickey Most resisted even doing it.  The story about Eric meeting Nina Simone was also very interesting.  Interesting views about Jimi Hendrix, too, of whom Eric was supposedly a good friend of.You could tell that early R&R; management, producers, touring, etc. took its toll on musicians, even when they were strong and young.  The Animals just got screwed from the get-go.  No wonder why they didn't last.All in all, a good documentary for Animals, Eric Burdon (and the Animals), and War fans.  My main gripes are a lack of identification of people being interviewed (at least do it on their first appearance), and music clips that only last a minute or two.  Come on documentary makers, many of us want to see the ENTIRE song, not just a short clip.  At least make it a menu item to watch the entire performances separately, if possible.  Warning - if you must have a performance clip of the song ""Sky Pilot"", it does NOT appear here.Sound quality varies (stereo and mono) but is acceptable considering the sources.",3,Three and 1/2 stars: Interesting but lacking full music performances,1234310400,"02 11, 2009",2009,1929,"['video', 'documentary', 'Animals', 'Eric', 'Burdon', 'bands', 'Animals', 'broke', 'up', 'up', 'including', 'War.There', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'interesting', 'interviews', 'commentary', 'music', 'contained', 'herein', 'just', 'short', 'clips.At', 'least', 'mostly', 'interview', 'people', 'relevant', 'story', 'mostly', 'Eric', 'Burdon', 'really', 'laid', 'back', 'way', 'are', 'also', 'interview', 'clips', 'Chas', 'Chandler', 'Alan', 'Price', 'etc.', 'appearances', 'Sammy', 'Hagar', 'awkward', 'place', 'guess', 'saw', 'Monterey', 'relevance.Very', 'interesting', 'stories', 'Animals', 'days', 'especially', 'touring', 'England', 'one', 'bus', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'who', 'apparently', 'were', 'not', 'very', 'compatible', 'touring', 'partners', 'put', 'nicely', 'story', 'hoot', 'Also', 'who', 'knew', 'House', 'Rising', 'Sun', 'was', 'done', 'one', 'take', 'management', 'Michael', 'Jeffries', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'fame', 'producer', 'Mickey', 'Most', 'resisted', 'even', 'doing', 'story', 'Eric', 'meeting', 'Nina', 'Simone', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'interesting', 'Interesting', 'views', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'too', 'whom', 'Eric', 'was', 'supposedly', 'good', 'friend', 'of.You', 'could', 'tell', 'early', 'R', 'R', 'management', 'producers', 'touring', 'etc', 'took', 'toll', 'musicians', 'even', 'when', 'were', 'strong', 'young', 'Animals', 'just', 'got', 'screwed', 'get-go', 'wonder', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'last.All', 'good', 'documentary', 'Animals', 'Eric', 'Burdon', 'Animals', 'War', 'fans', 'main', 'gripes', 'are', 'lack', 'identification', 'people', 'being', 'interviewed', 'least', 'do', 'first', 'appearance', 'music', 'clips', 'only', 'last', 'minute', 'two', 'Come', 'documentary', 'makers', 'many', 'want', 'see', 'ENTIRE', 'song', 'not', 'just', 'short', 'clip', 'least', 'make', 'menu', 'item', 'watch', 'entire', 'performances', 'separately', 'possible', 'Warning', 'must', 'have', 'performance', 'clip', 'song', 'Sky', 'Pilot', 'NOT', 'appear', 'here.Sound', 'quality', 'varies', 'stereo', 'mono', 'acceptable', 'considering', 'sources']",N/A

1180321,A3CSDBDV77Z0VI,B001DGFGQS,lily t.,"[2, 2]","If you already know a lot about Eric Burdon and the Animals, then you will be happy with this very short documentary, which is billed at two hours but in reality runs for one hour then repeats. To compensate for the lack of musical performances we then are subjected to the interjected musings of the smarmy Sammy Hagar [ I had no idea who he was or what he was doing there] talking about Eric Burdon and the Animals as if he [ or any other fan who was not present] had anything of relevance to contribute.Burdon is both intelligent and a fine storyteller, and his memories of some of the musical legends he had met and worked with are fascinating and delightful. His recollections of the appalling mismanagement and outright thievery of The Animals earnings are tempered by the fact that his love of making music outweighs any consideration of money and ego. And, although his career after the Animals is glossed over, it was interesting to me, since I had either forgotten or never knew about his association with War [ ! ].Several reviewers have mentioned being perplexed by the the fact that Burdon remains underrated. As someone who is  non-musical and female, I'll suggest that despite his powerful voice and amazing output, he lacked the physical prettiness that so many fans look for in a lead vocalist. I read an interview with Burdon afterward, where he mentions, in a different context, that people went to see bands and not hear them, and those bands that understood that fact, like The Stones, made the most of it. Interesting stuff.
