1430800,A1F93NA8HQ47IU,B004WO9OS4,"Reconnecting To My Childhood ""Time Won't Let ...","[11, 14]","The second last season of this classic 90's/2000's sitcom is finally going to be made available on DVD. There will once again be no special features but fans will be happy to at least own the episodes in decent quality. While the show does seem to trek along a more outlandish route than the coming of age relatability of earlier years, it nevertheless maintains a feeling of family and a sense of heart. These are the college years.It begins where season four left off. Topanga has proposed to Corey and he says yes, when their friends and family have mixed feelings it leads the pair to elope. Topanga then has trouble saying some very important words. At the same time, Eric and Jack get a new roommate, and the writers get new story possibilities, with the addition of (new main castmember) Rachel. Many stories this season involve Eric and Jack fighting for Rachel's attention in various ways.In the more relatable stories: Corey tries to take on more than he can handle at college. Shawn and Angela break up. Corey is concerned to find out that Angela doesn't consider him a friend. Corey worries he is mediocre. Corey worries that Shawn and Topanga might have feelings for eachother. Corey has issues with his engangement ring while out with the boys. Corey betrays Shawn's trust by publicly reading a poem he wrote about Angela. Eric gets a job as a mall Santa and gets everyone into the true spirit of Christmas while Corey and Topanga try to get Shawn and Angela back together. Topanga and Corey live together to test married life. Eric has an arc with an orphan named Tommy that helps him mature.In some serious stories: Shawn and Jack's father (Chet) comes back to town but has a heart attack. Shawn and Corey head off on a soulsearching road trip in the aftermath of the heart attack. When the new Matthews baby is born premature the entire family faces a crisis, a touching moment finds Corey wanting the old free spirited Topanga back (in reference to earlier seasons).On the sillier side: Mr. Feeny goes to college! Mr. Feeny, not long after, begins teaching college! Eric decides to broadcast his life from a camera in his apartment (a reference to a Jim Carey movie that many viewer's probably won't remember). Corey throws his mother (Amy) a baby shower that more closely resembles a bachelorette party. Corey and Shawn try to help Feeny win Dean Bolander's affection over her impressive world traveller ex-husband. Corey and Topanga's honesty pact begins to upset people. Corey has dreams about killing Shawn that have deeper meaning. The gang crashes a lavish wedding and Corey is offered a million dollars to marry the bride.There is also the classic episode where seemingly cool Professor Stuart (Fred Savage) makes a move on Topanga, a move which prompts Corey to make one of his own. It all leads to a campus hearing debating Corey's explusion in which everyone tries to determine what really happened and Mr. Feeny realizes the kids are growing up and need to learn to fend for themselves.Finally everything comes back around to Corey, Topanga and marriage. As Feeny and the Dean Bollander tie the knot, in the Matthew's living room of all places, Topanga's parents reveal they are getting divorced which throws Corey and Topanga's own wedding plans onto an uncertain path.One more season left. Hopefully LionsGate delivers it as quickly as they did the fourth and fifth!",5,Walking Down This Road That We Call Life (2),1303171200,"04 19, 2011",2011,3397,"['second', 'last', 'season', 'classic', ""90's/2000"", 'sitcom', 'finally', 'going', 'be', 'made', 'available', 'DVD', 'will', 'once', 'again', 'be', 'special', 'features', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'least', 'own', 'episodes', 'decent', 'quality', 'show', 'seem', 'trek', 'more', 'outlandish', 'route', 'coming', 'age', 'relatability', 'earlier', 'years', 'nevertheless', 'feeling', 'family', 'sense', 'heart', 'are', 'college', 'years.It', 'where', 'season', 'four', 'left', 'off', 'Topanga', 'proposed', 'Corey', 'yes', 'when', 'friends', 'family', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'pair', 'elope', 'Topanga', 'then', 'trouble', 'saying', 'very', 'important', 'words', 'same', 'time', 'Eric', 'Jack', 'get', 'new', 'roommate', 'writers', 'get', 'new', 'story', 'possibilities', 'addition', 'new', 'main', 'castmember', 'Rachel', 'Many', 'stories', 'season', 'involve', 'Eric', 'Jack', 'fighting', 'Rachel', 'attention', 'various', 'ways.In', 'more', 'relatable', 'stories', 'Corey', 'take', 'more', 'can', 'handle', 'college', 'Shawn', 'Angela', 'break', 'up', 'Corey', 'concerned', 'find', 'out', 'Angela', ""n't"", 'consider', 'friend', 'Corey', 'mediocre', 'Corey', 'Shawn', 'Topanga', 'might', 'have', 'feelings', 'eachother', 'Corey', 'issues', 'engangement', 'ring', 'out', 'boys', 'Corey', 'Shawn', 'trust', 'publicly', 'reading', 'poem', 'wrote', 'Angela', 'Eric', 'job', 'mall', 'Santa', 'everyone', 'true', 'spirit', 'Christmas', 'Corey', 'Topanga', 'try', 'get', 'Shawn', 'Angela', 'back', 'together', 'Topanga', 'Corey', 'live', 'together', 'test', 'married', 'life', 'Eric', 'arc', 'orphan', 'named', 'Tommy', 'mature.In', 'serious', 'stories', 'Shawn', 'Jack', 'father', 'Chet', 'back', 'town', 'heart', 'attack', 'Shawn', 'Corey', 'head', 'off', 'soulsearching', 'road', 'trip', 'aftermath', 'heart', 'attack', 'When', 'new', 'Matthews', 'baby', 'born', 'entire', 'family', 'crisis', 'touching', 'moment', 'Corey', 'wanting', 'old', 'free', 'spirited', 'Topanga', 'back', 'reference', 'earlier', 'seasons', '.On', 'sillier', 'side', 'Mr.', 'Feeny', 'college', 'Mr.', 'Feeny', 'not', 'long', 'teaching', 'college', 'Eric', 'broadcast', 'life', 'camera', 'apartment', 'reference', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'movie', 'many', 'viewer', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'remember', 'Corey', 'mother', 'Amy', 'baby', 'shower', 'more', 'closely', 'bachelorette', 'party', 'Corey', 'Shawn', 'try', 'help', 'Feeny', 'win', 'Dean', 'Bolander', 'affection', 'impressive', 'world', 'traveller', 'ex-husband', 'Corey', 'Topanga', 'honesty', 'pact', 'upset', 'people', 'Corey', 'dreams', 'killing', 'Shawn', 'have', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'gang', 'lavish', 'wedding', 'Corey', 'offered', 'million', 'dollars', 'marry', 'bride.There', 'also', 'classic', 'episode', 'where', 'seemingly', 'cool', 'Professor', 'Stuart', 'Fred', 'Savage', 'move', 'Topanga', 'move', 'Corey', 'make', 'one', 'own', 'campus', 'hearing', 'debating', 'Corey', 'explusion', 'everyone', 'determine', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'Mr.', 'Feeny', 'kids', 'are', 'growing', 'up', 'need', 'learn', 'fend', 'themselves.Finally', 'everything', 'back', 'Corey', 'Topanga', 'marriage', 'Feeny', 'Dean', 'Bollander', 'tie', 'knot', 'Matthew', 'living', 'room', 'places', 'Topanga', 'parents', 'reveal', 'are', 'getting', 'divorced', 'Corey', 'Topanga', 'own', 'wedding', 'plans', 'uncertain', 'path.One', 'more', 'season', 'left', 'Hopefully', 'LionsGate', 'delivers', 'as', 'quickly', 'did', 'fourth', 'fifth']",Boy Meets World: Season 6

1430805,A3BZ06T8L9LV8C,B004WO9OS4,XZero,"[8, 8]","Following very quickly after the release of Season 5, Lionsgate put out Season 6 of Boy Meets World. These episodes are a bit strange compared to the more relatable stories of season 2-5, but they're still enjoyable. Some of the memorable moments include Rachel joining the permanent cast, Chet Hunter's death, Joshua Matthews' birth, and Cory's experiences in college.Packaging is basically the same as the other 5 seasons as released by Lionsgate. There are 5 screenshots on the back of the box along with a basic summary of the season in text. As you can also tell from looking at the cover image, this season is the first to include more than Cory, Shawn, Topanga, and Eric on the cover. Jack, Angela, and Rachel join the others, and the picture is a nice image for this season. There is no episode listing anywhere on the set besides the DVD menus. Also note that this season has 22 episodes, which is a bit shorter than other seasons.The discs have the same yellow-green background color as the main packaging insert and feature Cory, Topanga, and Shawn on discs 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The menus continue to feature the Season 4 theme song in the background, which is odd for this set since seasons 5-7 use a different opening song.The episodes look great. This season was filmed in the late 1990s. It ran from 1998-99 on ABC's TGIF block. The transfer is as good as one would expect. The audio quality is also very good (again, keeping things in perspective).The set loses 1 star for its lack of extras. I debated that because it's great to finally get this series out on DVD, and Lionsgate deserves tremendous credit for releasing seasons 4-6 in a 6-month timeframe (with 7 apparently looking at a September launch window). But as a standalone DVD product, release context notwithstanding, it does fall a bit short for its lack of extras.Overall, by this point you're either buying these or you're not. If you fondly remember this series (which you likely do by the fact that you're bothering to look at this page on Amazon), this is a great set. If you never watched Boy Meets World, it's still a fun series to watch, but the real joy was watching it in the 1990s and literally growing up with Cory and the gang. For anyone who grew up in the 1990s, this is a fantastic piece of nostalgia that you should definitely pick up.And as a final note, one of the last episodes on this set, ""The Truth About Honesty,"" has the characters being honest with each other and exploring the ramifications of Cory's excessive honesty (at one point, he tells Topanga that whoever arranged her hair in the way she had it should be tied down and made to look at it). Eric brings a date to a party and he hasn't been honest with her about literally anything since the beginning of their brief relationship. Then, at the very end of the episode, he makes the outrageous and bizarre statement, ""I'm Batman."" This is the only truthful thing he tells her the entire time, as he was recently cast to play Terry McGinnis in WB's Batman Beyond animated series. Terry is the new Batman and replacement for Bruce Wayne. Thus, Eric, or more precisely, Will Friedle IS in fact Batman.",4,Cory in College,1309564800,"07 2, 2011",2011,3165,"['Following', 'very', 'quickly', 'release', 'Season', '5', 'Lionsgate', 'put', 'out', 'Season', '6', 'Boy', 'Meets', 'World', 'episodes', 'are', 'bit', 'strange', 'compared', 'more', 'relatable', 'stories', 'season', '2-5', ""'re"", 'still', 'enjoyable', 'memorable', 'moments', 'include', 'Rachel', 'joining', 'permanent', 'cast', 'Chet', 'Hunter', 'death', 'Joshua', 'Matthews', 'birth', 'Cory', 'experiences', 'college.Packaging', 'basically', 'same', 'other', '5', 'seasons', 'released', 'Lionsgate', 'are', '5', 'screenshots', 'back', 'box', 'basic', 'summary', 'season', 'text', 'can', 'also', 'tell', 'looking', 'cover', 'image', 'season', 'first', 'include', 'more', 'Cory', 'Shawn', 'Topanga', 'Eric', 'cover', 'Jack', 'Angela', 'Rachel', 'join', 'others', 'picture', 'nice', 'image', 'season', 'episode', 'listing', 'anywhere', 'set', 'DVD', 'menus', 'Also', 'note', 'season', '22', 'episodes', 'bit', 'shorter', 'other', 'seasons.The', 'discs', 'have', 'same', 'yellow-green', 'background', 'color', 'main', 'packaging', 'insert', 'feature', 'Cory', 'Topanga', 'Shawn', 'discs', '1', '2', '3', 'respectively', 'menus', 'continue', 'feature', 'Season', '4', 'theme', 'song', 'background', 'odd', 'set', 'seasons', '5-7', 'use', 'different', 'opening', 'song.The', 'episodes', 'look', 'great', 'season', 'was', 'filmed', 'late', '1990s', 'ran', '1998-99', 'ABC', 'TGIF', 'block', 'transfer', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'audio', 'quality', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'again', 'keeping', 'things', 'perspective', 'set', '1', 'star', 'lack', 'extras', 'debated', 'great', 'finally', 'get', 'series', 'out', 'DVD', 'Lionsgate', 'tremendous', 'credit', 'releasing', 'seasons', '4-6', '6-month', 'timeframe', '7', 'apparently', 'looking', 'September', 'launch', 'window', 'standalone', 'DVD', 'product', 'release', 'context', 'notwithstanding', 'fall', 'bit', 'short', 'lack', 'extras.Overall', 'point', ""'re"", 'buying', ""'re"", 'not', 'fondly', 'remember', 'series', 'likely', 'do', 'fact', ""'re"", 'bothering', 'look', 'page', 'Amazon', 'great', 'set', 'never', 'watched', 'Boy', 'Meets', 'World', 'still', 'fun', 'series', 'watch', 'real', 'joy', 'was', 'watching', '1990s', 'literally', 'growing', 'up', 'Cory', 'gang', 'anyone', 'who', 'grew', 'up', '1990s', 'fantastic', 'piece', 'nostalgia', 'should', 'definitely', 'pick', 'up.And', 'final', 'note', 'one', 'last', 'episodes', 'set', 'Truth', 'Honesty', 'characters', 'being', 'honest', 'other', 'exploring', 'ramifications', 'Cory', 'excessive', 'honesty', 'one', 'point', 'Topanga', 'whoever', 'arranged', 'hair', 'way', 'had', 'should', 'be', 'tied', 'made', 'look', 'Eric', 'date', 'party', ""n't"", 'been', 'honest', 'literally', 'anything', 'beginning', 'brief', 'relationship', 'Then', 'very', 'end', 'episode', 'outrageous', 'bizarre', 'statement', ""'m"", 'Batman', 'only', 'truthful', 'thing', 'entire', 'time', 'was', 'recently', 'cast', 'play', 'Terry', 'McGinnis', 'WB', 'Batman', 'Beyond', 'animated', 'series', 'Terry', 'new', 'Batman', 'replacement', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Thus', 'Eric', 'more', 'precisely', 'Will', 'Friedle', 'IS', 'fact', 'Batman']",Boy Meets World: Season 6
