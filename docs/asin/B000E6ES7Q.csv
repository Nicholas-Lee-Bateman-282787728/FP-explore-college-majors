969440,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B000E6ES7Q,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[37, 37]","I was entranced watching this short (just under 1 hour) film, which traces some of the major events in the life of Christian apologist and author C.S. Lewis. The story is told in flashbacks from the memory of an elderly Lewis, and the exquisite script is mostly culled from his writings. It makes one marvel at the beauty of the English language, and how descriptive it is. The scenes flow well, and though it is a mere sketch of a very complex and full life, one gets the sense of who Lewis was, how he lived, and the friends he knew, like J. R. R. Tolkien. He met Joy Davidman, an American mother of 2, in his later years, and this relationship brought Lewis love, as well as a crisis of faith, which is expressed with depth and sensitivity.Anton Rodgers as Lewis, and Diane Venora as Joy give remarkable performances. There is an intimacy and realism to their portrayals that make the biography come alive, and stir our emotions. The direction by Norman Stone is excellent, and the production gives one the feel of what the first half of the 20th century in England was like. Co-produced by Faith and Values Media for the Hallmark Channel, and filmed in locations where Lewis worked and lived, ""Beyond Narnia"" is a gentle film that will be appreciated by anyone who admires his books, or those who enjoy literate scripts and good acting.",5,A Captivating Biographical Film,1159401600,"09 28, 2006",2006,1340,"['was', 'entranced', 'watching', 'short', 'just', '1', 'hour', 'film', 'major', 'events', 'life', 'Christian', 'apologist', 'author', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'story', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'memory', 'elderly', 'Lewis', 'exquisite', 'script', 'mostly', 'culled', 'writings', 'one', 'marvel', 'beauty', 'English', 'language', 'how', 'descriptive', 'scenes', 'flow', 'well', 'mere', 'sketch', 'very', 'complex', 'full', 'life', 'one', 'sense', 'who', 'Lewis', 'was', 'how', 'lived', 'friends', 'knew', 'J.', 'R.', 'R.', 'Tolkien', 'met', 'Joy', 'Davidman', 'American', 'mother', '2', 'later', 'years', 'relationship', 'brought', 'Lewis', 'love', 'as', 'well', 'crisis', 'faith', 'expressed', 'depth', 'sensitivity.Anton', 'Rodgers', 'Lewis', 'Diane', 'Venora', 'Joy', 'give', 'remarkable', 'performances', 'intimacy', 'realism', 'portrayals', 'make', 'biography', 'come', 'alive', 'stir', 'emotions', 'direction', 'Norman', 'Stone', 'excellent', 'production', 'one', 'feel', 'what', 'first', 'half', '20th', 'century', 'England', 'was', 'Co-produced', 'Faith', 'Values', 'Media', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'filmed', 'locations', 'where', 'Lewis', 'worked', 'lived', 'Beyond', 'Narnia', 'gentle', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'appreciated', 'anyone', 'who', 'books', 'who', 'enjoy', 'literate', 'scripts', 'good', 'acting']",C.S.

969444,A3QAQUUPFIARWB,B000E6ES7Q,"Gord Wilson ""alivingdog.com""","[7, 7]","I was prepared not to like this DVD, as it seemed to be yet another attempt to tie into Lewisania and the recent film of the Chronicles of Narnia. After all, what could be the point of a DVD that lasts only an hour, and what could be said that hasn't already been said?  But this film instantly drew me in and quickly disarmed me. It's not a documentary in the general sense of the word, but is built around Anton Rogers, as C. S. Lewis, recalling his life, and segues into various scenes.Anton Rogers plays Lewis far better than Anthony Hopkins, and instead of sets, the shots are on location at Oxford, including the Eagle and Child pub where Lewis met with ""Tollers"" (J.R.R. Tolkien), Charles Williams and the other writers and friends known as the Inklings. My title comes from one of the numerous great lines Rogers says throughout the film, which seems largely drawn from Lewis' two autobiographies, Surprised By Joy and All My Road Before Me, as well as A Grief Observed, which he wrote after his wife Joy's death, and originally published under a pseudonym.The last was a difficult time for Lewis, and the handling here, while necessarily telegraphic in such a brief film, is better than in Shadowlands, where it was played solely for effect. I found the ending somewhat unsatisfactory, but it's probably difficult to tie up at that point when in fact Lewis wrote more books and lectured for some time after. This film assumes one has read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, and refers to it as the first Narnian Chronicle, which it originally was, having been written in 1950. The recent reordering of the books to follow chronological events in Narnia has caused some confusion, but of course, all one needs to do is read them in the old order. That said, this DVD is like opening the wardrobe again, as it takes one further up and further in, beyond Narnia.",5,Imagination Reflects Heavenly Truth,1175731200,"04 5, 2007",2007,1872,"['was', 'prepared', 'not', 'like', 'DVD', 'seemed', 'be', 'yet', 'attempt', 'tie', 'Lewisania', 'recent', 'film', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'point', 'DVD', 'only', 'hour', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'said', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'said', 'film', 'instantly', 'drew', 'quickly', 'disarmed', 'not', 'documentary', 'general', 'sense', 'word', 'built', 'Anton', 'Rogers', 'C.', 'S.', 'Lewis', 'recalling', 'life', 'segues', 'various', 'scenes.Anton', 'Rogers', 'Lewis', 'far', 'better', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'instead', 'sets', 'shots', 'are', 'location', 'Oxford', 'including', 'Eagle', 'Child', 'pub', 'where', 'Lewis', 'met', 'Tollers', 'J.R.R', 'Tolkien', 'Charles', 'Williams', 'other', 'writers', 'friends', 'known', 'Inklings', 'My', 'title', 'one', 'numerous', 'great', 'lines', 'Rogers', 'film', 'largely', 'drawn', 'Lewis', 'two', 'autobiographies', 'Surprised', 'Joy', 'All', 'My', 'Road', 'Me', 'as', 'well', 'A', 'Grief', 'Observed', 'wrote', 'wife', 'Joy', 'death', 'originally', 'published', 'pseudonym.The', 'last', 'was', 'difficult', 'time', 'Lewis', 'handling', 'here', 'necessarily', 'telegraphic', 'such', 'brief', 'film', 'better', 'Shadowlands', 'where', 'was', 'played', 'solely', 'effect', 'found', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'unsatisfactory', 'probably', 'difficult', 'tie', 'up', 'point', 'when', 'fact', 'Lewis', 'wrote', 'more', 'books', 'lectured', 'time', 'film', 'one', 'read', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'refers', 'first', 'Narnian', 'Chronicle', 'originally', 'was', 'having', 'been', 'written', '1950', 'recent', 'reordering', 'books', 'follow', 'chronological', 'events', 'Narnia', 'caused', 'confusion', 'course', 'one', 'needs', 'do', 'read', 'old', 'order', 'said', 'DVD', 'opening', 'wardrobe', 'again', 'one', 'further', 'up', 'further', 'Narnia']",C.S.

There are cuts back and forth from the autobiographical narrator and those acting out the scenes.Over the years I have seen several videos about C. S. Lewis. I have read many hundreds of pages. And here are all the facts told in an orderly way. The film is easy to understand and very engaging. The sets and costumes help tell the visual story as the narrator talks.This movie is recommended for all those who want to understand the live of C S Lewis both as the writer of the Narnia Chronicles as well as his many other books.

969448,A2OCXCD2GALADH,B000E6ES7Q,Michael Dalton,"[82, 83]","It's remarkable how ordinary and seemingly insignificant events prove pivotal, and in God's economy part of his grand design.  Such is the case in the life of C.S. Lewis.  He wrote, ""I always believed that miracles can happen.  You just have to be at the right place at the right time.""The tragic loss of his mother led to a cruel English boarding school experience.  Begging to leave, he came out into the spacious freedom of a demanding but beloved tutor, who inspired a love of learning and knowledge.  It served as preparation for Oxford University.His education was interrupted by what was called ""The Great War.""  Did the tragedy and horror of it confirm his atheism?  Wounded in battle, he returned to his studies and Christian friends like J.R.R. Tolkien, who challenged his atheistic assumptions.His defenses began to crumble when he realized that not only were his best friends Christian, his favorite books were written by Christian authors.  He could no longer deny God's existence and felt the pressure of God's pursuit.He had been filled with trepidation at the thought of becoming a believer, but in 1929 he reluctantly surrendered.  It was anything but joyous.But years later, after a career in writing had emerged, he agreed to meet with an American woman who had written him.  This seemingly insignificant event would forever change his life.  He was at the right place at the right time.  Joy Gresham would become his friend, and later to make it possible for her to stay in England, Lewis agreed to a hasty ""paper"" marriage.It was the tragedy of Joy's cancer that brought their love to the surface, which led to a real marriage before God.  At last Lewis would know the joy in his sixties that he had been denied in his twenties.  This pleasure would prove to be fleeting, as Joy's recovery was only temporary.She eventually succumbed leaving Lewis to question the faith he had espoused and defended.  In back of all the twists and turns in his life, stood the God who helped Lewis and his stepchildren carry on.All of these scenes and more are beautifully depicted in this dramatic presentation.  Amazingly, it condenses into 54 minutes all the periods and highlights of his life.  The pacing is even and relaxed; it never feels rushed.This is not a documentary.  An assortment of actors, including a man who looks like an older Lewis, vividly and expertly recreate his life.The promotional DVD copy opens with an advertisement for this production and did not have any of the bonus features listed on the box.  This includes Lewis and Narnia trivia, information about Lewis and a few other items related to the Narnia books.The presentation opens with Lewis as a child exploring an old cottage.  Then it flashes forward to 1963 with the older Lewis narrating his story.  The different episodes are played out in between narration and commentary.  Lewis serves as a guide; everything comes to us from his perspective.As you might expect, this is more realistic and less dramatic than ""Shadowlands,"" the popular Hollywood version of his life.  It also has a warmth and production that exceeds the PBS story.  This may be the best and is probably the most concise depiction of Lewis on film.Those who know his story may not learn anything new, but this works because it's well-done, entertaining and realistic.  It's a loving depiction that serves as a great follow-up to the ""Narnia"" movie.  It takes us beyond Narnia to show us the miracle of the life behind it.",4,"""I always believed that miracles can happen.

Lewis that you would assume would be far beyond a child's understanding and yet at a young age, this writer captured my heart. His Narnia books birthed in me a love for reading and his life is an interesting study in soul growth and maturing through life's complexity.In this brief dramatized introduction to his life, we enter a world where C.S. Lewis talks about his life while sitting by a fireplace. This has the feeling of a fireside chat with portrayals of C.S. Lewis' discovery of true love, his life as a writer and his struggles to accept the reality of God's existence, all while he says he was angry at God for not existing. There are some great moments of humor throughout.If you have read the work of C.S. Lewis, especially ""A Grief Observed,"" then ""Beyond Narnia"" presents a deeper understanding of how C.S. Lewis lost the woman he loved. I found myself caught up in the tragic romance, the intimacy of the conversations and the stories of his life in Oxford.The filming locations are beautiful, libraries and historic settings add intrigue. I suppose the only thing I felt a little distracted by was how C.S. Lewis' beliefs about God were presented. While most of the aspects of his conversion from atheism to Christianity seem correct, I think at the point at which he would have been telling his story, he would have been less critical of God. Reading Mere Christianity gives a much more in depth look at his true feelings.It seems true to say that the more you learn about C.S. Lewis, the more fascinated you become. This docudrama doesn't really address the Chronicles of Narnia in detail, nor does it really explore any of C.S. Lewis' writing. This is more about his childhood, his personal relationship with God and his understanding of grief. When you think about, how many authors could so influence a life? Not only are his children's books completely fascinating, his writings on spirituality are some of the most profound literary moments I've ever encountered. Each time I take time to study more about C.S. Lewis, I find myself even more curious about this fascinating author who has so influenced my life.So, I can recommend this to you if you are studying C.S.

Lewis, this will introduce them in very well done intro to the life that produced this wonderful series.  It is filmed in many of the actual locations where he lived and wrote, and is historically very accurate.For those of us who are familiar with this background material already, I also commend this video, as it was great to see the actual footage and the portrayal by Anton Rogers is hauntingly good.The final scene is especially poignant, from the Final Battle entering into eternity there are chapters that only get better and better.The bonus features accessible by personal computer with DVD capabiblity are good also.",5,Behind Narnia Peek,1197849600,"12 17, 2007",2007,787,"['exceptionally', 'good', 'DVD', 'two', 'classes', 'potential', 'viewers', 'first', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'heard', 'much', 'background', 'Narnia', 'genius', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'will', 'introduce', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'intro', 'life', 'produced', 'wonderful', 'series', 'filmed', 'many', 'actual', 'locations', 'where', 'lived', 'wrote', 'historically', 'very', 'accurate.For', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'background', 'material', 'already', 'also', 'commend', 'video', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'actual', 'footage', 'portrayal', 'Anton', 'Rogers', 'hauntingly', 'good.The', 'final', 'scene', 'especially', 'poignant', 'Final', 'Battle', 'entering', 'eternity', 'are', 'chapters', 'only', 'get', 'better', 'better.The', 'bonus', 'features', 'accessible', 'personal', 'computer', 'DVD', 'capabiblity', 'are', 'good', 'also']",C.S.

I have never read anything by Lewis that I didn't like and I always learn something from reading his writings. He forces you to think.  But who was the man behind the writings?  That's what BEYOND NARNIA explores.  This short DVD (about 55 minutes) examines key experiences from Lewis' life by having Lewis himself (portrayed by an actor) tell us through a series of reenacted scenes from his life.  The idyllic early years of his childhood, the death of his mother, his years at boarding school, the tutelage under the Great Knock, the Great War, his years of teaching, his friendship with J.R.R. Tolkien, and his relationship with his eventual wife, Joy, are all discussed.  More time is spent on some of these areas than others, but each of them provides insight who Lewis was. Even though I knew most of the information and had read most of the stories, I really enjoyed BEYOND NARNIA. It's short, but quite accurate.  It's educational and entertaining without being dry.

Most of the lines delivered by the actor portraying Jack were right out of his written works. Only one puzzle hit me and that was the abreviated approach to his conversion. It seemed to skip over which books and discussions had a great influence on him. It suggested his change of mind occurred in his room while I have often heard it happened while traveling one day, but maybe this was a different issue. Overall, this is a nice summary of his life.",4,Well made and on location,1196035200,"11 26, 2007",2007,563,"['was', 'professionally', 'made', 'footage', 'be', 'mostly', 'locations', 'where', 'CS', 'Lewis', 'lived', 'worked', 'Most', 'lines', 'delivered', 'actor', 'portraying', 'Jack', 'were', 'right', 'written', 'works', 'Only', 'one', 'puzzle', 'hit', 'was', 'abreviated', 'approach', 'conversion', 'seemed', 'skip', 'over', 'books', 'discussions', 'had', 'great', 'influence', 'suggested', 'change', 'mind', 'occurred', 'room', 'have', 'often', 'heard', 'happened', 'traveling', 'one', 'day', 'maybe', 'was', 'different', 'issue', 'Overall', 'nice', 'summary', 'life']",C.S.
