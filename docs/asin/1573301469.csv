188321,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,1573301469,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[13, 13]","I absolutely adore Charlotte Church.  However much some people belittle her talent or claim she is being manipulated by people who are going to ruin her voice, she is a star of stars in my eyes.  She truly does have the voice of an angel; it's the most beautiful voice I've ever heard.  This DVD is a special treat indeed because it allows us to hear and see Charlotte at the very beginning of her professional career.  She had already topped the classical charts with her debut album, and now, mere days after her thirteenth birthday, she gave her first true concert, backed up by the London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus - and we can all be there time and again with the 5000 or so fans physically in attendance that night.  The music is fantastic, Charlotte is as charming as she can be, and an inside look at her life at home and her preparation for the concert show us a perfectly normal child who just happens to have a magical voice.After a short introductory piece, Charlotte walks out on stage with no sign of nerves whatsoever.  She brings a couple of friends with her, a white stuffed bear and a shaking critter whom she likens to her Dad before the show (as he was obviously more nervous than Charlotte was about her big night).  Every trace of the adorable little child disappears once she stands before the mike, though.  She leads off with Panis Angelicus, and the transformation from excited youngster to world-class soprano is amazing; while Charlotte always shows her love for what she does, she also reveals her serious commitment to each song in her whole demeanor.  After each song, her youthful nature shines forth in smiles and laughs, but her seriousness never relents until the orchestra plays the final note of each song.  She sings eleven songs in all in this concert performance, ten of which come from her Voice of an Angel CD, backed up by a huge orchestra and sizeable chorus.  Her delivery of The Lord's Prayer is impeccable and soul-stirring, even more so in the light of the attack on 9/11 and another singer's moving rendition of the song during the national memorial service following the tragedy.  Danny Boy is also a beautiful song; Charlotte's version of this song is respectfully somber but not quite as mournful as most renditions I have heard.The Welsh songs are particularly lovely, possessing a nature that really draws me into each song even though I have no idea what Charlotte is singing about.  My Lagan Love, Suo-Gan, and Y Gylfinir (The Curlew) - one of the Three Welsh Bird Songs from her debut album - are quite magical.  Her friend Gwilym Evans joins her for two songs: Charlotte's signature song Pie Jesu and When at Night I Go to Sleep; his high voice blends well with Charlotte's, but he appears far more nervous than Charlotte was.  Charlotte's final song of the evening closes the night out in grand, exciting style, as the London Welsh Male Voice Choir joins her in a stirring rendition of Men of Harlech (the one song here that you won't find on her debut CD).The concert is fairly short, but it is followed by a wonderful look at the real Charlotte Church.  We get visions of both her family and school life, showing Charlotte trying to juggle homework in between interviews for television, newspapers, and magazines from all over the world.  She and her mother look to have a loving and fun relationship, and Charlotte is as proud of her family as they are of her.  The little girl in her is clear to see, as evidenced by a huge stuffed animal collection and her innocent zest for life, and it is reinforced by her mother's descriptions of her sulking prowess.  Charlotte is refreshingly normal and down-to-earth, and she makes it clear that she is singing and performing because that is what she loves and wants to do forever; in no way is anyone manipulating her into doing anything she doesn't want to do.The Voice of an Angel DVD is essentially Charlotte Church's coming-out party; she had proved to the world that she could sing like an angel, and with this concert she proved that she could perform in front of a large audience and not only blow the audience away with a voice of the rarest beauty but also display all the charms and poise of a true star while doing it.  I don't see how anyone could watch this DVD and not love Charlotte Church.",5,Charlotte Church is divine in her first solo concert,1070323200,"12 2, 2003",2003,4314,"['absolutely', 'Charlotte', 'Church', 'However', 'much', 'people', 'belittle', 'talent', 'claim', 'being', 'manipulated', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'ruin', 'voice', 'star', 'stars', 'eyes', 'truly', 'have', 'voice', 'angel', 'most', 'beautiful', 'voice', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'DVD', 'special', 'treat', 'indeed', 'hear', 'see', 'Charlotte', 'very', 'beginning', 'professional', 'career', 'had', 'already', 'topped', 'classical', 'charts', 'debut', 'album', 'now', 'mere', 'days', 'thirteenth', 'birthday', 'gave', 'first', 'true', 'concert', 'backed', 'up', 'London', 'Symphony', 'Orchestra', 'Chorus', 'can', 'be', 'there', 'time', 'again', '5000', 'so', 'fans', 'physically', 'attendance', 'night', 'music', 'fantastic', 'Charlotte', 'as', 'charming', 'can', 'be', 'inside', 'look', 'life', 'home', 'preparation', 'concert', 'show', 'perfectly', 'normal', 'child', 'who', 'just', 'have', 'magical', 'voice.After', 'short', 'introductory', 'piece', 'Charlotte', 'out', 'stage', 'sign', 'nerves', 'whatsoever', 'couple', 'friends', 'white', 'stuffed', 'bear', 'shaking', 'critter', 'whom', 'Dad', 'show', 'was', 'obviously', 'more', 'nervous', 'Charlotte', 'was', 'big', 'night', 'trace', 'adorable', 'little', 'child', 'disappears', 'once', 'mike', 'though', 'Panis', 'Angelicus', 'transformation', 'excited', 'youngster', 'world-class', 'soprano', 'amazing', 'Charlotte', 'always', 'love', 'what', 'also', 'serious', 'commitment', 'song', 'whole', 'demeanor', 'song', 'youthful', 'nature', 'shines', 'forth', 'smiles', 'laughs', 'seriousness', 'never', 'orchestra', 'final', 'note', 'song', 'sings', 'eleven', 'songs', 'concert', 'performance', 'ten', 'come', 'Voice', 'Angel', 'CD', 'backed', 'up', 'huge', 'orchestra', 'sizeable', 'chorus', 'delivery', 'Lord', 'Prayer', 'impeccable', 'soul-stirring', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'light', 'attack', '9/11', 'singer', 'moving', 'rendition', 'song', 'national', 'memorial', 'service', 'following', 'tragedy', 'Danny', 'Boy', 'also', 'beautiful', 'song', 'Charlotte', 'version', 'song', 'respectfully', 'somber', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'mournful', 'most', 'renditions', 'have', 'heard.The', 'Welsh', 'songs', 'are', 'particularly', 'lovely', 'possessing', 'nature', 'really', 'draws', 'song', 'even', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'Charlotte', 'singing', 'about', 'My', 'Lagan', 'Love', 'Suo-Gan', 'Y', 'Gylfinir', 'Curlew', 'one', 'Three', 'Welsh', 'Bird', 'Songs', 'debut', 'album', 'are', 'quite', 'magical', 'friend', 'Gwilym', 'Evans', 'two', 'songs', 'Charlotte', 'signature', 'song', 'Pie', 'Jesu', 'When', 'Night', 'Go', 'Sleep', 'high', 'voice', 'blends', 'well', 'Charlotte', 'far', 'more', 'nervous', 'Charlotte', 'was', 'Charlotte', 'final', 'song', 'evening', 'night', 'out', 'grand', 'exciting', 'style', 'London', 'Welsh', 'Male', 'Voice', 'Choir', 'stirring', 'rendition', 'Men', 'Harlech', 'one', 'song', 'here', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'debut', 'CD', '.The', 'concert', 'fairly', 'short', 'followed', 'wonderful', 'look', 'real', 'Charlotte', 'Church', 'get', 'visions', 'family', 'school', 'life', 'showing', 'Charlotte', 'trying', 'juggle', 'homework', 'interviews', 'television', 'newspapers', 'magazines', 'world', 'mother', 'look', 'have', 'loving', 'fun', 'relationship', 'Charlotte', 'proud', 'family', 'are', 'little', 'girl', 'clear', 'see', 'evidenced', 'huge', 'stuffed', 'animal', 'collection', 'innocent', 'zest', 'life', 'reinforced', 'mother', 'descriptions', 'sulking', 'prowess', 'Charlotte', 'refreshingly', 'normal', 'down-to-earth', 'clear', 'singing', 'performing', 'what', 'do', 'forever', 'way', 'anyone', 'manipulating', 'doing', 'anything', ""n't"", 'want', 'do.The', 'Voice', 'Angel', 'DVD', 'essentially', 'Charlotte', 'Church', 'coming-out', 'party', 'had', 'proved', 'world', 'could', 'sing', 'angel', 'concert', 'proved', 'could', 'perform', 'front', 'large', 'audience', 'not', 'only', 'blow', 'audience', 'away', 'voice', 'rarest', 'beauty', 'also', 'display', 'charms', 'poise', 'true', 'star', 'doing', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', 'watch', 'DVD', 'not', 'love', 'Charlotte', 'Church']",Charlotte Church - Voice of an Angel in Concert
188322,A12MWZLH2ROH4Y,1573301469,James C. Meese,"[7, 8]","Charlotte Church will hopefully remain one of the voices of the future. She is a remarable talent proving that today's young people are capable of great things besides hip hop and rap. Without seeing her perform, it would be hard to realize that such a magnificent voice came out of someone so young. She is the essence of youth untouched by the drugs, booze, and sex emulating from today's modern music culture. She is a refreshing change from the stale, everybody sounds alike music of our supposedly dominate society.",5,An Angel Indeed,1080950400,"04 3, 2004",2004,520,"['Charlotte', 'Church', 'will', 'hopefully', 'remain', 'one', 'voices', 'future', 'remarable', 'talent', 'proving', 'today', 'young', 'people', 'are', 'capable', 'great', 'things', 'hip', 'hop', 'rap', 'seeing', 'perform', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'realize', 'magnificent', 'voice', 'came', 'someone', 'so', 'young', 'essence', 'youth', 'untouched', 'drugs', 'booze', 'sex', 'emulating', 'today', 'modern', 'music', 'culture', 'refreshing', 'change', 'stale', 'everybody', 'alike', 'music', 'supposedly', 'dominate', 'society']",Charlotte Church - Voice of an Angel in Concert
188323,A281NPSIMI1C2R,1573301469,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[7, 8]","Charlotte's voice is even more spectacular when she is singing in concert. And who could not love a singer who introduces her Teddy Bear to the audience? It was so cute and made you realize how young she actually was when she sang at her first solo concert. Here she takes center stage for the first time, makes jokes that the audience loves and declares that various songs are of unknown origin.She is quite the personality and I had to just laugh when she declared that the Men of Harlech were looking so ""posh"" in their matching suits.By watching her in concert you will be able to see the contrast between her teenage personality and her angelic and almost adult presence when singing for an audience. It is as if an angelic force pervades her very being. She could be as ancient an angel as one who first sang for God at the beginning of time.Within her is a beautiful soul which radiates throughout her being when she is on a stage. I noticed how while practicing her songs she seems much more shy, but she comes alive completely onstage. There are times when she does seem under the spell of her own voice.Not only does Charlotte take on some complex songs for her age, she sings each song as if she has always known these songs. In fact, she started singing at a very young age and has a very musical family. The beauty of her voice has the power to bringa grown man to tears.Songs in this Concert which are also from the Voice of an Angel CD include:Panis AngelicusThe Lord's PrayerMae Hiraeth yri y MorIn TrutinaPie JesuDanny BoyMy Lagan LoveSuo-GanY GylfinirWhen at Night I Go to SleepIn this DVD, you get to see behind-the-scenes footage and glimpses of her life. Everyone in her life seems to just come alive in a new way when they are around her. It is as if the light in her being also flows to everyone around her.Of course, she was also a very young Welsh schoolgirl at the time who was known to pout and have disagreements with her mom. She is very human and yet has been blessed with an amazing talent. We forget all about how human she is when hearing her sing her signature tune, Pie Jesu. Especially while surrounded by candles and an amazing orchestral accompaniment. The sheer confidence everyone places in Charlotte was part of what impressed me.Part of the beauty of her voice is the innocence. She is truly a natural. In a way, it is unfair to compare her to anyone else. She is unique. This is a child who took charge of her own future at a very early age. In this DVD you will see how she actually started her career by her own actions. It is not her mother pushing her, but rather encouraging her to be the best she can be. They show Charlotte and her mother laughing and it does seem they have a very good relationship.""I was watching Richard and Judy and they said they were looking for talented kids. No one was around so I phoned up."" ""The producers said I had to sing down the phone. So I did 'Pie Jesu,' and that was it. I was invited on the show! Mum and Dad were the last to find out!"" -Charlotte ChurchI look forward to seeing her acting in the 2003 release of ""I'll be There,"" which is a comedy. She actually made her acting debut in the UK TV drama 'Heartbeat'.Charlotte's biggest ambition is to sing in her favorite opera - Madame Butterfly -at La Scala in Milan. You know, this Welsh soprano might just do it one day. After all, she has already had a concert at The Megaron in Athens.At 17, she has seen so much success. I can only imagine a wonderful future for this motivated young star. She was born Feb. 21, 1986.Also look for:Charlotte Church - Enchantment (From Cardiff, Wales) (2001)Charlotte Church - In Jerusalem (2001)Dream a Dream: Charlotte Church in the Holy Land (2000)Christmas Glory from Westminster (2000)Charlotte Church: Prelude - The Best of Charlotte Church (2002)EnchantmentVoice of an AngelI'll be There CDVoice of an Angel AudiobookVoice of an Angel: My Life (So Far)Sometimes in this world where we live with tragedy and sorrow day after day, God does something miraculous.
