796585,AQSNJ8HQ3WHMS,B0001907BC,cyclista,"[38, 39]","I loved the book and the movie.  I never miss the series.  Even reruns are tremendous.  In this season, several episodes are standouts.  ""Deja Voodoo"" and ""The Hunt"" were dynamite episodes  worth watching over and over again. ""The Hunt"" shows remote viewing, which is the ability to ""see"" things from a distant location. I had read about government use of remote viewing some 15 years ago!  What they showed in this episode was similar to what I had read.Here is a brief episode guide, which I hope will be helpful.1. Valley of the Shadow:  The kidnapper of a CEO's son is obsessed with Johnny.2. Descent(1): Several teenagers are lost in an abandoned mine owned by Johnny's grandfather.3. Ascent (2): Johnny psychically enters Walt's coma.4. The Outsider:  Johnny has a vision that a skin cream is responsible for severe birth defects in the future.5. Precipitate:  After Johnny is given a blood transfusion from 6 donors, he has visions of their lives.6. Scars:  Stillson's political rival is a war veteran.  Guest star (gs): Gerald McRaney7. Misbegotten:  Three women kidnap Johnny and take him to a house where a family was killed.8. Cabin Pressure:  Johnny has a vision that the jet he is on will crash.9. The Man Who Never Was:  After a delivery person leaves an item belonging to a shut-in, Johnny gets a vision that he is disappearing.  gs: Robert Culp.10. Dead Men Tell Tales:  Johnny saves the life of a mob boss and ends up in the middle of a mafia dispute.11. Playing God:  Johnny has a vision that a friend will die in a car accident.  Every vision shows a worse outcome, whenever Johnny tries to save her.  gs: Ally Sheedy.12. Zion:  Bruce's father has died and Bruce comes face to face with an unresolved past.  gs: Louis Gossett, Jr.13. The Storm:  While Bruce is trying to bring Johnny to an intervention, Johnny has visions of a massive storm.14. Plague:  Johnny ""sees"" a high school science fair during which a deadly illness spreads to the children.15. Deja Voodoo:  Johnny has a vision of a romantic encounter with a beautiful woman that ends in her death.  (Especially good and unpredictable.)16. The Hunt:  Johnny participates in remote viewing sponsored by the CIA.  Osama Bin Laden as a target is implied but never spoken.  (Gripping episode.)17. The Mountain:  Johnny has a vision that a plane with valuable cargo had crashed in the mountains.18. The Combination:  Johnny's vision is that a boxer will die during a fight.19. Visions:  A man from the future asks for Johnny's help.",5,Another gripping season,1076889600,"02 16, 2004",2004,2506,"['loved', 'book', 'movie', 'never', 'miss', 'series', 'Even', 'reruns', 'are', 'tremendous', 'season', 'several', 'episodes', 'are', 'standouts', 'Deja', 'Voodoo', 'Hunt', 'were', 'dynamite', 'episodes', 'worth', 'watching', 'over', 'again', 'Hunt', 'remote', 'viewing', 'ability', 'see', 'things', 'distant', 'location', 'had', 'read', 'government', 'use', 'remote', 'viewing', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'What', 'showed', 'episode', 'was', 'similar', 'what', 'had', 'brief', 'episode', 'guide', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'helpful.1', 'Valley', 'Shadow', 'kidnapper', 'CEO', 'son', 'obsessed', 'Johnny.2', 'Descent', '1', 'Several', 'teenagers', 'are', 'lost', 'abandoned', 'mine', 'owned', 'Johnny', 'grandfather.3', 'Ascent', '2', 'Johnny', 'psychically', 'Walt', 'coma.4', 'Outsider', 'Johnny', 'vision', 'skin', 'cream', 'responsible', 'severe', 'birth', 'defects', 'future.5', 'Precipitate', 'Johnny', 'given', 'blood', 'transfusion', '6', 'donors', 'visions', 'lives.6', 'Scars', 'Stillson', 'political', 'rival', 'war', 'veteran', 'Guest', 'star', 'gs', 'Gerald', 'McRaney7', 'Misbegotten', 'Three', 'women', 'kidnap', 'Johnny', 'take', 'house', 'where', 'family', 'was', 'killed.8', 'Cabin', 'Pressure', 'Johnny', 'vision', 'jet', 'will', 'crash.9', 'Man', 'Who', 'Never', 'Was', 'delivery', 'person', 'item', 'belonging', 'shut-in', 'Johnny', 'vision', 'disappearing', 'gs', 'Robert', 'Culp.10', 'Dead', 'Men', 'Tell', 'Tales', 'Johnny', 'life', 'mob', 'boss', 'up', 'middle', 'mafia', 'dispute.11', 'Playing', 'God', 'Johnny', 'vision', 'friend', 'will', 'die', 'car', 'accident', 'vision', 'worse', 'outcome', 'whenever', 'Johnny', 'save', 'gs', 'Ally', 'Sheedy.12', 'Zion', 'Bruce', 'father', 'died', 'Bruce', 'face', 'face', 'unresolved', 'past', 'gs', 'Louis', 'Gossett', 'Jr.13', 'Storm', 'Bruce', 'trying', 'bring', 'Johnny', 'intervention', 'Johnny', 'visions', 'massive', 'storm.14', 'Plague', 'Johnny', 'sees', 'high', 'school', 'science', 'fair', 'deadly', 'illness', 'spreads', 'children.15', 'Deja', 'Voodoo', 'Johnny', 'vision', 'romantic', 'encounter', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'death', 'Especially', 'good', 'unpredictable.', '16', 'Hunt', 'Johnny', 'remote', 'viewing', 'sponsored', 'CIA', 'Osama', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'target', 'implied', 'never', 'spoken', 'Gripping', 'episode.', '17', 'Mountain', 'Johnny', 'vision', 'plane', 'valuable', 'cargo', 'had', 'crashed', 'mountains.18', 'Combination', 'Johnny', 'vision', 'boxer', 'will', 'die', 'fight.19', 'Visions', 'man', 'future', 'Johnny', 'help']",The Dead Zone - The Complete Second Season

796587,A298D6BLPSPGHI,B0001907BC,Fantasy Lore,"[4, 6]","After I'd finished watching the entire first season DVD set and started reading people's opinions here of this 2nd-season set, I paid no attention to the negative reviews because I loved the first season so much, but for me the second season is definitely a mixed bag, more so than the first at least. The majority of the episodes are good and there are even a few really outstanding episodes (i.e. Precipitate/The Man Who Never Was/Deja Voodoo/The Hunt), but there are also some very average, if not really uninspired episodes too.The first 3 episodes in particular do no justice to the over-all quality of the season- it's not that they don't follow on from the season 1 cliffhanger (armageddon), as that is satisfactorily drawn-out across the entire season- it's more that these episodes just feel direction-less and don't make enough of a statement about Jonny's gift or people's reaction to his now-renowned supernatural dead zone. Where this season really shines though is in the guest appearances, which are so brilliantly cast and also add a great deal to their respective episodes- Robert Culp and Reiko Aylesworth are my personal favorites of the many guest-actors and are in my favourite episodes of this season too. And both of these episodes again prove how well this show can do drama and science-fiction, personal stories and action, equally well.The season finale episode 'Visions', although entertaining and an advance of the continuing armageddon story, is a bit of a dissappointment after it was alluded to for so long running up to the finale. It doesn't leave us knowing anything more than we knew already and also is cut ridiculously short, which made me mad, although I guess also wanting more, which is a good thing. In summary this is the dead zone we know and love, and while I loved having 19 episodes rather than 13, some episodes could easily have been cut from the season without disrupting the flow of Jonny's on-going story. But as the final credits rolled of the final episode, I admit I was feeling more than ever a great admiration for this high-quality show that continues to surprise...",4,The Dead Zone continuing into greatness...,1104364800,"12 30, 2004",2004,2123,"[""'d"", 'finished', 'watching', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'set', 'started', 'reading', 'people', 'opinions', 'here', '2nd-season', 'set', 'paid', 'attention', 'negative', 'reviews', 'loved', 'first', 'season', 'so', 'much', 'second', 'season', 'definitely', 'mixed', 'bag', 'more', 'so', 'first', 'least', 'majority', 'episodes', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'even', 'few', 'really', 'outstanding', 'episodes', 'i.e', 'Precipitate/The', 'Man', 'Who', 'Never', 'Was/Deja', 'Voodoo/The', 'Hunt', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'average', 'not', 'really', 'uninspired', 'episodes', 'too.The', 'first', '3', 'episodes', 'particular', 'do', 'justice', 'over-all', 'quality', 'season-', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'season', '1', 'cliffhanger', 'armageddon', 'satisfactorily', 'drawn-out', 'entire', 'season-', 'more', 'episodes', 'just', 'feel', 'direction-less', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'enough', 'statement', 'Jonny', 'gift', 'people', 'reaction', 'now-renowned', 'supernatural', 'dead', 'zone', 'Where', 'season', 'really', 'shines', 'though', 'guest', 'appearances', 'are', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'cast', 'also', 'add', 'great', 'deal', 'respective', 'episodes-', 'Robert', 'Culp', 'Reiko', 'Aylesworth', 'are', 'personal', 'favorites', 'many', 'guest-actors', 'are', 'favourite', 'episodes', 'season', 'too', 'episodes', 'again', 'prove', 'how', 'well', 'show', 'can', 'do', 'drama', 'science-fiction', 'personal', 'stories', 'action', 'equally', 'well.The', 'season', 'finale', 'episode', ""'Visions"", 'entertaining', 'advance', 'continuing', 'armageddon', 'story', 'bit', 'dissappointment', 'was', 'alluded', 'so', 'long', 'running', 'up', 'finale', ""n't"", 'leave', 'knowing', 'anything', 'more', 'knew', 'already', 'also', 'cut', 'ridiculously', 'short', 'made', 'mad', 'guess', 'also', 'wanting', 'more', 'good', 'thing', 'summary', 'dead', 'zone', 'know', 'love', 'loved', 'having', '19', 'episodes', 'rather', '13', 'episodes', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'season', 'disrupting', 'flow', 'Jonny', 'on-going', 'story', 'final', 'credits', 'rolled', 'final', 'episode', 'admit', 'was', 'feeling', 'more', 'ever', 'great', 'admiration', 'high-quality', 'show', 'surprise']",The Dead Zone - The Complete Second Season

796591,A1ESB50QBN4KT8,B0001907BC,Jean-Luc,"[7, 18]","Previously I reported on this site that Season 2 was sub-par. Well it starts out that way, but it gets better. And thanks to Amazon.com's neat new ""Edit/Delete Review"" function, I can right my wrong. So anyway, the price was right so I bought the DVD set, and now I can sing a different tune and say that it's an ""O.K."" season. However there are definitely some bad episodes, many more than in the stellar, nearly flawless first season which I highly recommend picking up.THE DVD:Widescreen is awesome. The picture is great, and so is the sound. The extras are phenomenal, just like the first season. Commentaries on every episode, 5.1 sound, widescreen, movie-like transfers, what more can you ask for? And affordably priced, too. :)THE SHOW:Season 2 is a mixed bag. Unlike Season 1, which was consistently good, the only thing consistent about this season is its inconsistency. But there are 19 episodes this time around, beating out Season 1's mere 13. In this regard, bad episodes in Season 2 can be forgiven. So without further adieu, on to the episodes.SEASON 2 EPISODE MINI-REVIEWS AND RATINGS:2.01 Valley of the Shadow- The ""Millenium/Seven"" episode of Dead Zone. Very boring. A lousy way to start the season. Talk about turning away new viewers, I mean, I loved the first season, but this was just plain bad.GRADE: 3/102.02 Descent (1)- The first of a two-parter, another bad episode. Johnny and Walt have a boring adventure in a mine looking for trapped kids. I mean ""Little House On The Prairie"" did this better. Wow, the first two eps of the season and they're barely watchable.GRADE: 4/102.03 Ascent (2)- We're getting better, folks. This episode is OK, however it is a clear rip-off of a ""Star Trek: Voyager"" episode. Fans know what I'm talking about.GRADE: 5.5/102.04 The Outsider- This is the ""Earth: Final Conflict"" episode of Dead Zone. Not bad.GRADE: 5/102.05 Precipitate- Terrible, just terrible. Johnny gets blood and has visions of the donors, and he takes Bruce along for the pointless ride. This episode is so lame you will swear Dead Zone off your TV diet forever.GRADE: 2/102.06 Scars- A very good episode. It's about time, too. This season was a total write-off up to this point. In this episode Johnny helps one of the Simon&Simon; brothers come to terms with his murderous past in Vietnam.GRADE: 8/102.07 Misbegotten- This is the ""Blair Witch"" episode of Dead Zone. It's decent.GRADE: 6/102.08 Cabin Pressure- Excellent. Airplane disaster episodes are always great, just like the one on FOX's ""John Doe"" (a spectacular but cancelled show by the way). One of the best episodes of the series.GRADE: 9.5/102.09 The Man Who Never Was- Awful, simply awful. A lonely old man turns out to be a retired James Bond.GRADE: 1.5/102.10 Dead Men Tell Tales- The ""Godfather"" episode of Dead Zone. Not great, not bad either. Fa-get about it.GRADE: 5/102.11 Playing God- This is the ""Breakfast Club Reunion Special"" episode of Dead Zone. Mostly boring.GRADE: 4.5/102.12 Zion- This is the Bruce episode. Bruce finally gets his own episode and it's lousy beyond words. Oh well.GRADE: 1/102.13 The Storm- After waking up from your Zion nap, you're in for a treat with this mostly entertaining episode about a tornado or wind storm or whatever sent by God apparently to follow around and eventually kill Johnny -- or teach him an important lesson or something. Or both, I forget which.GRADE: 7.5/102.14 Plague- The ""SARS"" episode of Dead Zone. Alternatively it is the ""Outbreak"" episode of Dead Zone. A good episode.GRADE: 8/102.15 Deja Voodoo- This is the ""Groundhog Day"" episode of Dead Zone, in which we learn that Johnny, with his powers, can never lose or be beaten and can cheat his way out of anything. This episode also taught us that Johnny is never in any real danger because his powers are far too god-like. A great episode!GRADE: 9/102.16 The HuntThis is the Osama episode of Dead Zone. It is also the single worst episode I have ever seen ever on any show ever. EVER. Additionally this episode is a ripoff of a ST: Deep Space Nine episode, at least in its idea of pairing Johnny (Dr. Bashir) with three freaks like himself.GRADE: 0/10 (that's right, ZERO -- it's THAT bad)2.17 The Mountain- This is the ""Cliffhanger"" (Stallone movie) episode of Dead Zone. It's pretty good.GRADE: 7.5/102.18 The Combination- This is the ""Rocky"" episode of Dead Zone, in which the Apollo Creed of this episode is facing sure defeat, likely death, at the hands of the Drago of this episode. A mediocre episode.GRADE: 4.5/102.19 Visions- A nice season finale (nothing spectacular). Still, it has its moments. In it we finally find out who the mysterious hooded man is that kept appearing in Johnny's visions throughout the season. It turns out it's that guy from ""Career Opportunities"" (with Jennifer Connelly) back for revenge. Haha. ;)GRADE: 8/10OVERALL:Even though the second season was far from perfect, it is still light years better than most of the crap on television. Plus it's widescreen, loaded with extras, and cheap. So BUY IT. :)",4,"GET IN THE ZONE WITH DEAD ZONE  (Great DVD, O.K.

796593,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B0001907BC,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[1, 1]","If you never saw season 2 of the Dead Zone, I strongly recommend it. It's even more engaging and intriguing than  the first season. Anthony Michael Hall is even better than he was in the first season. When the part calls for him to throw out a funny line, he's hilarious. Like when a man accuses him of trying to grab his wife he says ""I didn't try to grab her, I tried to touch her, big difference"". Also he's wonderful in serious scenes as well. I don't know why he or this show weren't nominated for emmys because it's an excellent show.There's not one bad episode in this season either. Even when one starts off slow and you think ""ok I'm gonna skip this one"". By the middle of that episode you're hooked and can't wait to see where it's gonna go and how it's gonna end. This is just one gripping show and Anthony Michael Hall does his best work period. Also look for an appearence from fellow Breakfast Club  star Ally Sheedy. She's in a good one where if she dies in a car accident, her heart will save her brother and also Hall's friend.

Not only did it satisfy viewers with plots from the book and original movie, it gave us a killer cliff-hanger.When season two debuted I was somewhat dissapointed. The premier wasn't that great of an episode, and I heard ratings were low. But by the time the first 6-7 episodes had aired, I knew this season was going to be the best. Some of the episodes hit you hard, like ""Playing God"", where no matter what Johnny does, he must choose the life of one of two friends. There is no winner. The ""Sexy Summer Seven"", including the originally deleted episode, ""The Hunt"", were also some of my favorites. The season finale of season two not only surpassed season one's, it set up the plot for season three.

796596,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0001907BC,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[26, 27]","The one thing definitely established by the second season of &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; is exactly how great of a job Michael Piller and Shawn Piller did of turning Stephen King's novel into a television series.  The climax of the novel was Johnny Smith's desperate act to derail the future of political candidate Greg Stillson, an act which succeeds but at the cost of Johnny's life (although Johnny had an inoperable brain tumor at that point).  In the series Johnny (Anthony Michael Hall) is still plagued by visions of the nuclear destruction of Washington, D.C., because of something Stillson (Sean Patrick Flanery) does in the future, but the moment of crisis has yet to come and by the end of the second season Johnny has serious doubts about his own role in the disaster to come.  This may well be the climax of the series, but the Pillers have made that a future encounter, adding key elements to the developing situation (&quot;Scars&quot;).Equally important is that Stillson is no longer a thug turned populist demagogue but more of a traditional corrupt politician.  This represents the attention paid to developing the key supporting characters.  In this version Sarah (Nicole de Boer) is still married with a child, but the child is Johnny's and she is married to Sherrif Walt Bannerman (Chris Bruno), now spared from a fatal encounter of his own with a rabid St. Bernard named Cujo.  What would have been a mandatory soap opera love triangle has been avoided, and indeed the two-part &quot;Ascent&quot;/&quot;Descent&quot; near the start of this second season resolves a lot of the inherent tensions in these relationships by bringing them into the open.  In this season episodes start focusing on the relationship between Johnny and his son (&quot;Plague,&quot; &quot;The Mountain&quot;).The series also takes advantage of three created characters.  As Bruce Lewis (John L. Adams), Johnny's physical therapist turned friend, our hero has not only a sidekick (&quot;Precipitate&quot;) but a willing ear for exposition and explanation.  Then there is Dana Bright (Kristen Dalton), a reporter who becomes interested and then enamored with Johnny, providing another convert in the inner circle who can provide help.  Finally, from Johnny's evangelical mother in the novel the series transmutes the Reverend Gene Purdy, who served as a villain at the beginning of the series before Stillson arrived, but now becomes both an ally (&quot;Cabin Pressure,&quot; &quot;Plague&quot;) and a voice of conscience (&quot;Playing God&quot;).The other key thing about this series is that it deals with a world in which Johnny Smith has a reputation in what can be considered a rather realistic manner.  This means dealing with people who are out to get him in various ways (&quot;Valley of the Shadow,&quot; &quot;Misbegotten&quot;) as well as those who consider him to be a curiosity (&quot;The Storm&quot;).  It also provides an interesting episode in which Johnny works with the government to try and &quot;find&quot; Osama Bin Laden (&quot;The Hunt&quot;).  We also find &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; playing creatively with Johnny's powers when he has a blood transfusion (&quot;Precipitate&quot;) and an interesting encounter with a woman in a bar (&quot;Deja Voodoo&quot;), and shares his visions with not only Bruce (&quot;Zion&quot;) but a figure that has been haunting his life (&quot;Visions&quot;).  These are probably the episodes that best indicate that this is a show that is both creative and intelligent.  I thought the first season was pretty good, but the second is even better.There are two things to know about the production schedule for the second season.  First, the episode &quot;The Hunt&quot; was originally scheduled to be the 12th episode of the season and air on March 30, 2003 but was delayed until July 27 because of the outbreak of the war with Iraq.  Second, &quot;Zion&quot; was supposed to be the final episode of the second season but the USA network asked for another six episodes starting with &quot;The Storm.&quot;  Called by fans &quot;Season 2.5&quot; this includes my favorite episode of the season, &quot;Deja Voodoo,&quot; and a pivotal story arc involving the &quot;Burned Man&quot; (Frank Whaley).  Good thing the Third Season is on right now because who wants to wait for the next DVD set for anything more than the great extras (even though they are undoing a couple of the points I praised above big time in the first half-dozen episodes).Indeed, this set has some great extras because one additional thing that makes this DVD a class act is the high involvement of Anthony Michael Hall and others in the commentary track.  Every episode has such a track and Hall is on most of them, as are most of the major guest stars, such as Hall's fellow alumni from &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; Ally Sheedy (&quot;Playing God&quot;), Academy Award winning actor Louis Gossett, Jr. (&quot;Zion&quot;), and Reiko Aylesworth (&quot;Deja Voodoo&quot;) from &quot;24.&quot;  There are several examples of storyboard comparisons with the finished episode and interviews with notable guest stars.  In terms of fan friendly DVD extras &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; sets the standard for others to follow.",5,&quot;The Dead Zone&quot; gets even better in the Second Season,1088208000,"06 26,

796602,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B0001907BC,Mitch Weaver,"[40, 43]","Up until very recently, I was extremely skeptical about this show for two different reasons. The first and most obvious reason was because Anthony Michael Hall played the lead character. Most people including myself have only seen Anthony play nerdy characters in John Hughes movies, and other roles in unknown &quot;B&quot; films. The second reason why I was always skeptical, was because I figured that there was no way that a weekly television show could be made dealing with the characters from Stephen King's book and the film, because it is a story that is pretty specific and hard to stretch out. However, after I finished watching the first season of The Dead Zone, I became instantly hooked. But, going into the second season, I never could have prepared myself for how much better the show could get.Once again, the second season of The Dead Zone lets Anthony Michael Hall show that he is a very decent actor that deserves to be taken seriously. He does such a wonderful job as Johnny Smith. Anthony makes the character extremely believeable and easy to connect with. The show also features a great mix of romance, drama, and suspense with all of the visions that Johnny receives, as well as Johnny trying to deal with the fact that the woman he loves is married to someone else. It is also great to see Johnny try and connect with his son, who has no idea that Johnny is his father. In the first season, Johnny's son would not even talk to him. Season two has Johnny and his son starting to become friends and bond more. The second season also manages to be even better than the first season in terms of episode quality and overall storytelling. In the second season, there is 19 episodes and there was only one episode that I could not get into. Every other episode grabbed my attention from the beginning and did not let go until the end credits. The second season of the show establishes that The Dead Zone is the most addictive and well done science fiction show since The X-Files. The second season of The Dead Zone is so addictive in fact, that I went through all 19 episodes over the span of two days.Overall, the second season of The Dead Zone offers a fantastic array of quality episodes and wonderful performances from all the actors involved. This set offers one of the best seasons I have ever seen from any television program. It also offers outstanding picture and sound quality as well as tons of great extras. My favorite feature was definately the interviews with all the guest stars. It was very interesting to hear their take on the show and their roles. You also get deleted scenes and more.A solid 5 stars...",5,Flat out amazing!!,1087516800,"06 18, 2004",2004,2640,"['Up', 'very', 'recently', 'was', 'extremely', 'skeptical', 'show', 'two', 'different', 'reasons', 'first', 'most', 'obvious', 'reason', 'was', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'played', 'lead', 'character', 'Most', 'people', 'including', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'Anthony', 'play', 'nerdy', 'characters', 'John', 'Hughes', 'movies', 'other', 'roles', 'unknown', 'quot', 'B', 'quot', 'films', 'second', 'reason', 'why', 'was', 'always', 'skeptical', 'was', 'figured', 'was', 'way', 'weekly', 'television', 'show', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'dealing', 'characters', 'Stephen', 'King', 'book', 'film', 'story', 'pretty', 'specific', 'hard', 'stretch', 'out', 'However', 'finished', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'became', 'instantly', 'hooked', 'going', 'second', 'season', 'never', 'could', 'have', 'prepared', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'show', 'could', 'get.Once', 'again', 'second', 'season', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'show', 'very', 'decent', 'actor', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'wonderful', 'job', 'Johnny', 'Smith', 'Anthony', 'character', 'extremely', 'believeable', 'easy', 'connect', 'show', 'also', 'great', 'mix', 'romance', 'drama', 'suspense', 'visions', 'Johnny', 'as', 'well', 'Johnny', 'trying', 'deal', 'fact', 'woman', 'married', 'someone', 'else', 'also', 'great', 'see', 'Johnny', 'try', 'connect', 'son', 'who', 'idea', 'Johnny', 'father', 'first', 'season', 'Johnny', 'son', 'would', 'not', 'even', 'talk', 'Season', 'two', 'Johnny', 'son', 'starting', 'become', 'friends', 'bond', 'more', 'second', 'season', 'also', 'be', 'even', 'better', 'first', 'season', 'terms', 'episode', 'quality', 'overall', 'storytelling', 'second', 'season', '19', 'episodes', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'episode', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'other', 'episode', 'grabbed', 'attention', 'beginning', 'did', 'not', 'let', 'go', 'end', 'credits', 'second', 'season', 'show', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'most', 'addictive', 'well', 'done', 'science', 'fiction', 'show', 'X-Files', 'second', 'season', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'so', 'addictive', 'fact', 'went', '19', 'episodes', 'span', 'two', 'days.Overall', 'second', 'season', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'fantastic', 'array', 'quality', 'episodes', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'actors', 'involved', 'set', 'one', 'best', 'seasons', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'television', 'program', 'also', 'outstanding', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'as', 'well', 'tons', 'great', 'extras', 'favorite', 'feature', 'was', 'definately', 'interviews', 'guest', 'stars', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'hear', 'take', 'show', 'roles', 'also', 'get', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'more.A', 'solid', '5', 'stars']",The Dead Zone - The Complete Second Season

796608,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,B0001907BC,Wayne C. Rogers,"[1, 1]","The second season of The Dead Zone has proved even better than the first.  All the actors are now more comfortable in their roles and the basic story line is running smoothly.  There are nineteen episodes in Season Two, rather than the thirteen that made up Season One, the twelve on Season Three, and the twelve on Season Four.  All of the episodes are excellent, but a few really raise the standards for network television as far as touching the heart and soul of its characters.On Disc One is a two-part episode in which Johnny Smith (played by Anthony Michael Hall) and Sheriff Bannerman (played by Chris Bruno) go into a copper mine to save some trapped teenagers.  During the attempted rescue, Bannerman is severely injured when a cave-in occurs.  If Bannerman dies, the door will be open for Johnny to finally be with Sarah and his son.  Johnny, however, chooses to fight for Bannerman's life by going into his mind and giving him a reason to live.  On Disc Two, there's an episode where Johnny has the opportunity to stop Greg Stillson's bid for Congress by supporting the opposing candidate, Harrison Fisher (played by guest star, Gerald McRaney).  The only problem is that when Johnny shakes Fisher's hand, he sees Fisher as part a Navy Seal team in Vietnam destroying a village of innocent women and children.  Fisher immediately senses what Johnny saw and doesn't know what to do.  The thing is that Fisher's a good man and he can beat Stillson in the election.  What to do is the question.  Another episode on Disc Two deals with an elderly man (played by Robert Culp) that Johnny befriends.  The man used to be a spy for the American government.  Now, he's kept under a kind of house arrest because of the knowledge that's inside his head.  When Johnny gets too involved with the man, the government starts putting pressure on him to back off or else, not to mention moving the man to a different location.  On Disc Three, there's an episode where Johnny unintentionally causes the death of a low level mobster who was planning to murder his boss in order to protect the woman he loved.  When Johnny finally discovers the hidden reasons behind the mobster's actions, he decides to put his life on the line and to do what the man was unable to accomplish.  In still another episode, Johnny finds out this his best friend is dying from a heart disease, but that he will receive a donor's heart at the last minute.  The catch here is that it will be from his friend's sister (played by Ally Sheedy), who dies in an unexpected car accident.  The sister is in love with Johnny and wants to begin a relationship with him.  Johnny tries to change the outcome so that both will live, but in the end it finally comes down to whether or not Johnny allows his friend to die, or his friend's sister to live and what that will set in motion.  On Disc Four, a particular episode has Johnny seeing a vision of himself kissing the beautiful woman that he's sitting next to in a restaurant bar and then the both of them being murdered by a would-be mugger.  Everything he attempts to do to change the future causes a different, but equally fatal outcome.  He also finds himself attracted to this lady and realizes that it could affect her decision about accepting a marriage proposal.  Last, but not least, on Disc Five is an episode that will lead you into Season Three.  A man from the future (played by Frank Whaley) warns Johnny about the death of his wife and daughter and wants Johnny to save them.  In return, he'll tell Johnny what happens when Armageddon arrives.  What he shows Johnny will have you running out to buy the boxed set of Season Three.These were just a few of the great episodes in the second season of The Dead Zone.  All the guest stars played their roles to the hilt and made you care about the finale.  You either wanted them to live or to die, depending of their character.  The episodes also show you just how difficult it would be for a man of Johnny's ability to help those that he comes into contact with.  Most of the people he tries to help don't believe in his visions and distrust him.  That, however, doesn't deter him in his efforts to help.  There was one episode in which the airplane that he and the Reverend Purdy were flying on was going to crash.  When Johnny attempted to warn the captain of the plane, the Air Marshall on board arrested him.  What would you do if you were him in this situation?  Or, if you were a passenger on the plane, wouldn't you think the strange-acting guy was nuttier than a fruitcake?  There were a number of times when watching the various episodes that I would've held back on what I'd seen in my visions if I were Johnny, keeping my mouth shut and allowing nature to take its course.  No, not Johnny!  He jumps right into the dilemma with both legs kicking.  And, of course, every action has a reaction.  You can't always change the future of something without creating a worse scenario.  I will say that Anthony Michael Hall deserves a Golden Globe Award or something for his magnificent performance in every single show.  Talk about a hard-working actor.  This man is in just about every scene in every show.  Mr. Hall also has the character down perfectly.  This is a very talented actor who deserves a lot of credit for making this television series work.  No brag, just fact.  As far as the extras go, all five of the discs in the set have bonus features on them that deal with the making of a particular episode, how the whole show is produced and how they try to stay within the budget, not to mention numerous interviews with the guest stars.  Now, if only Season Three and Season Four are as good as Season Two, I'll be one happy camper.",5,This television series keeps getting better and better!!!,1175299200,"03 31,

796609,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0001907BC,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[4, 4]","""The Dead Zone"" pulled in viewers and critics with its rich storytelling, great performances and direction. Unfortunately, the audience is small by network standards which means that the rest of the world is focusing on a fine series called ""Medium"" (but which can't hold a candle to ""The Dead Zone"") or they will be focusing on the remake of the inspiration for ""The X-Files"" ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" (with Stuart Townshend). That's too bad because, however fine ""Kolchak"" turns out to be (and I have no doubt it'll be exceptionally good with ""Files"" writer/producer Frank Spotnitz at the helm), ""The Dead Zone"" deserves a lot more attention than its getting.Johnny Smith went into a 6 year coma after a car accident. His girl married another man, his son doesn't know him and he has the ability to see both what could happen and what has happened because of his time in the zone. He's helping the police solve crimes and learning quite a lot about the darkness of the human soul (even his own).Every frame of the second season, like the first, has the quality of a feature film (much like ""The X-Files"")but the storytelling arc (established in King's original novel)focusing on politican Greg Stillson and the potential disaster he may bring to the world is what sets this series apart from other shows of its type. Stillson shows up during the second season as Johnny's opposite--a perfect foil to Johnny Smith. The second season consists of 19 episodes with a commentary for every single episode. The picture quality is exceptional (and the packaging meager to begin with has improved with a sleeve for the boxed set).I'd suggest digging in with the first season to see if it interests you. If it doesn't grab you within the first three episodes, you're truly in ""The Dead Zone"" yourself. Sure the second season had some episodes that weren't quite up to the high standard of the best produced during season two--that doesn't matter as every episode has its filler episodes. I'd argue there's very little filler here. Producer/writer/creator Michael Piller (and his son Shaun)worked on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" and the early years of ""Deep Space Nine"" making those series exceptional dramas. They've done the same here.
