Now, that doesn't help a person who hasn't seen the movie for himself yet. Here's the middle ground:NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VEGAS VACATION, or just plain VEGAS VACATION, was released 14 years after VACATION. This one is by no means as good, however, by itself, it is a laugh riot!Again, Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo are back as Mr. and Mrs. Griswold, off on a family vacation, this time off to...you guessed it-Las Vegas! Randy Quaid tags along again this time as Cousin Eddie, but why the same kids as in the first movie couldn't be used here is beyond me! It seems like keeping the same cast together would help the film. However, it is good enough. Wallace Shawn as a Vegas dealer is as funny as always. Sid Caesar has a great cameo at the end as a Mr. Ellis, who gives the Griswolds his winning lottery ticket. Ironically, in the first film, Imogene Coca (Caesar's partner in his SHOW OF SHOWS back in the late 40's and early 50's) was cast as Aunt Edna. Here's Sid Caesar this time, and it's a pity he couldn't have lent his talents more to the rest of the film.This is one of those films that, despite its flaws, it seems to have a certain touch that makes it funny. It's a pleasure watching. And the whole thing was shot on location, so you get some great glimpses of Vegas throughout the film.Highlights include the Hoover Dam sequence, and the scene at Cousin Eddie's house.See this one when you get a chance. Don't expect quite the same as VACATION, but this really does come pretty close. A bit less offensive than the first film-it's rated PG instead of R, so it might be better for the family.",5,"Not as funny as the first, but still a classic!",1377129600,"08 22, 2013",2013,1756,"['Okay', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'seen', 'reviews', 'here', 'say', '34', 'Vegas', 'best', 'Vacation', 'ever', '34', 'then', '34', 'Vegas', 'worst', 'Vacation', 'ever', '34', 'Now', ""n't"", 'help', 'person', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'yet', 'Here', 'middle', 'ground', 'NATIONAL', 'LAMPOON', 'VEGAS', 'VACATION', 'just', 'plain', 'VEGAS', 'VACATION', 'was', 'released', '14', 'years', 'VACATION', 'one', 'means', 'good', 'however', 'laugh', 'riot', 'Again', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'Beverly', ""D'Angelo"", 'are', 'back', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Griswold', 'off', 'family', 'vacation', 'time', 'guessed', 'it-Las', 'Vegas', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'along', 'again', 'time', 'Cousin', 'Eddie', 'why', 'same', 'kids', 'first', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'used', 'here', 'keeping', 'same', 'cast', 'together', 'would', 'help', 'film', 'However', 'good', 'enough', 'Wallace', 'Shawn', 'Vegas', 'dealer', 'as', 'funny', 'always', 'Sid', 'Caesar', 'great', 'cameo', 'end', 'Mr.', 'Ellis', 'who', 'Griswolds', 'winning', 'lottery', 'ticket', 'Ironically', 'first', 'film', 'Imogene', 'Coca', 'Caesar', 'partner', 'SHOW', 'OF', 'SHOWS', 'back', 'late', '40', 'early', '50', 'was', 'cast', 'Aunt', 'Edna', 'Here', 'Sid', 'Caesar', 'time', 'pity', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'lent', 'talents', 'more', 'rest', 'film.This', 'one', 'films', 'flaws', 'have', 'certain', 'touch', 'funny', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'get', 'great', 'glimpses', 'Vegas', 'film.Highlights', 'include', 'Hoover', 'Dam', 'sequence', 'scene', 'Cousin', 'Eddie', 'house.See', 'one', 'when', 'get', 'chance', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'quite', 'same', 'VACATION', 'really', 'come', 'pretty', 'close', 'bit', 'less', 'offensive', 'first', 'film-it', 'rated', 'PG', 'instead', 'R', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'family']",N/A

What makes it even more disappointing is that it came off the great, hilarious classic that is ""Christmas Vacation"". Clark Griswald takes his family(including kids who haven't aged since 1983)to that great vacation town of all time : Las Vegas!. Now, that has the ingredients of something really funny, but the filmmakers didn't exploit it enough. They didn't really use the silliness of the town for great comedy. It just kind of flounders. There is a scene with Christie Brinkley reprising her role from the original, which is a nice little touch. Randy Quaid returns as Cousin Eddie. He has a few good lines, but is not the great comedic relief he was in ""Christmas Vacation"". Chevy Chase does his best with a weak, flimsy script, but even he couldn't save this dead dog. As I've stated before in other ""Vacation"" reviews, the actual road trip to the destination, like in the original, is what makes it work. Hopping on the plane and getting there in 2 minutes doesn't help things. It should always be a road trip adventure. Oh well, that's just me. I do have to admit that this fourth actress to play Audrey is really hot!. If all else fails, you got that. If there's a fifth film, I think the kids need to be their real age(early 30's), and the Griswalds take the grandkids to Disneyland or something. Just a thought. Let's hope there isn't another 'Vacation' movie, unless they can get their act together and give us something as fun and memorable as the first and third.

Although on the low end of hilarity when compared to Vacation, European Vacation, and Christmas Vacation, the film is nonetheless a non-stop, belly-laughing comedy in its own right. After all, how can we expect anything to live up to the genius of a perfect comedy like Christmas Vacation? Complete with a brand new set of children, Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo once again form an onscreen comedy duo that is simply magical...When Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) gets a large bonus as a company reward for inventing a new food preservative, he and his wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) decide that the money would best be spent on a good old-fashioned family vacation. But when kids Rusty (Ethan Embry) and Audrey (Marisol Nichols) bicker over the destination, the only place that gets unanimous reviews from the family is a Las Vegas vacation.Flying to Vegas, the family experiences a series of pitfalls that threatens to tear them apart forever. Clark becomes a gambling addict (even gambling on rock-paper-scissors and a guy doing a ""I'm thinking of a number between one and ten"" routine at a low-rent casino), Ellen becomes the target of Wayne Newton's seduction, underage Rusty becomes a gambling superstar under the false identity of Nicholas Pappagiorgio, and Audrey tries her hand in exotic dancing after a rendezvous with her stripper cousin Vicki... Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) makes another show-stealing performance as the redneck, dumber-than-a-doorknob relative, and he shadows Clark around the casinos generously imbibing his beverage of choice - a thirty-ounce can of Busch Light.The funniest scenes in the film involve Eddie (as always) and his trailer trash family, now living in a trailer on a parcel of land Eddie purchased cheap because it's a burial ground for nuclear waste. And Rusty's various exploits under the alias of Nic Pappagiorgio are extremely amusing. Meeting up with a group of quasi-mafia, professional gamblers, Rusty enjoys the massages, comp suites, and various frills associated with the biggest names in the business. Vegas Vacation is just downright funny. If you liked the earlier films, don't miss this one...Continuing the stellar reputation of the Vacation film series, Vegas Vacation is pure entertainment fun from beginning to end. Chevy Chase is up to his usual antics, and Wayne Newton turns in a classic performance in his role as Griswold home-wrecker. Family friendly, Vegas Vacation is a comedy made for both parents and children alike. And its role as yet another show-stopper in the long-line of Griswold comedies makes Vegas Vacation a definite must-see...The DVD Report",4,Hilarious!,1114041600,"04 21, 2005",2005,2775,"['One', 'funniest', 'movies', '1997', 'Vegas', 'Vacation', 'up', 'high', 'standard', 'comic', 'relief', 'expected', 'ongoing', 'series', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'low', 'end', 'hilarity', 'when', 'compared', 'Vacation', 'European', 'Vacation', 'Christmas', 'Vacation', 'film', 'nonetheless', 'non-stop', 'belly-laughing', 'comedy', 'own', 'right', 'how', 'can', 'expect', 'anything', 'live', 'up', 'genius', 'perfect', 'comedy', 'Christmas', 'Vacation', 'Complete', 'brand', 'new', 'set', 'children', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'Beverly', ""D'Angelo"", 'once', 'again', 'form', 'onscreen', 'comedy', 'duo', 'simply', 'magical', 'When', 'Clark', 'Griswold', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'large', 'bonus', 'company', 'reward', 'inventing', 'new', 'food', 'preservative', 'wife', 'Ellen', 'Beverly', ""D'Angelo"", 'decide', 'money', 'would', 'best', 'be', 'spent', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'family', 'vacation', 'when', 'kids', 'Rusty', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'Audrey', 'Marisol', 'Nichols', 'bicker', 'destination', 'only', 'place', 'unanimous', 'reviews', 'family', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'vacation.Flying', 'Vegas', 'family', 'series', 'pitfalls', 'tear', 'apart', 'forever', 'Clark', 'gambling', 'addict', 'even', 'gambling', 'rock-paper-scissors', 'guy', 'doing', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'number', 'one', 'ten', 'routine', 'low-rent', 'casino', 'Ellen', 'target', 'Wayne', 'Newton', 'seduction', 'underage', 'Rusty', 'gambling', 'superstar', 'false', 'identity', 'Nicholas', 'Pappagiorgio', 'Audrey', 'hand', 'exotic', 'dancing', 'rendezvous', 'stripper', 'cousin', 'Vicki', 'Cousin', 'Eddie', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'show-stealing', 'performance', 'redneck', 'dumber-than-a-doorknob', 'relative', 'Clark', 'casinos', 'generously', 'imbibing', 'beverage', 'choice', 'thirty-ounce', 'can', 'Busch', 'Light.The', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'film', 'involve', 'Eddie', 'always', 'trailer', 'trash', 'family', 'now', 'living', 'trailer', 'parcel', 'land', 'Eddie', 'purchased', 'cheap', 'burial', 'ground', 'nuclear', 'waste', 'Rusty', 'various', 'exploits', 'alias', 'Nic', 'Pappagiorgio', 'are', 'extremely', 'amusing', 'Meeting', 'up', 'group', 'quasi-mafia', 'professional', 'gamblers', 'Rusty', 'massages', 'comp', 'suites', 'various', 'frills', 'associated', 'biggest', 'names', 'business', 'Vegas', 'Vacation', 'just', 'downright', 'funny', 'liked', 'earlier', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'one', 'Continuing', 'stellar', 'reputation', 'Vacation', 'film', 'series', 'Vegas', 'Vacation', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'fun', 'beginning', 'end', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'up', 'usual', 'antics', 'Wayne', 'Newton', 'classic', 'performance', 'role', 'Griswold', 'home-wrecker', 'Family', 'friendly', 'Vegas', 'Vacation', 'comedy', 'made', 'parents', 'children', 'alike', 'role', 'yet', 'show-stopper', 'long-line', 'Griswold', 'comedies', 'Vegas', 'Vacation', 'definite', 'must-see', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

Personally, I thought this one wasn't nearly as funny as any of the other three. In fact, it felt to me like Vegas Vacation was really, really trying to live up to the reputation the past films in the series had made for itself. Basically, it was trying too hard to be funny. This is not to say the film wasn't good - it was, but it was so-so. I do commend the makers of the movie for showing how the average person can be seduced and pulled into gambling by the pretty lights and loud noises in a casino. I'd safely bet a hardcore gambler who watches this film could relate to Clark blowing the family's nest egg in the casino.Honestly, I wouldn't suggest buying this film unless you find it in a bargain bin somewhere. It's not horrible, but it's nowhere near as gut-bustingly funny as Christmas Vacation, European Vacation, and Vacation. And it probably didn't help that this movie was made about eight years after Christmas Vacation - Chevy still has it talent-wise, but he had clearly aged and looked so much different while his wife's actress seemed to age much more gracefully. Not to mention the other films were made in the 80s and just had more of a softer, classic feel to them while this one seemed like it didn't belong.

The Griswold trilogy ended on a high note with 1989's CHRISTMAS VACATION.  Unfortunately this production is as robust as using the same coffee grounds repetetively.By the title alone you already know the story.  Almost every movie or television show that has an episode in Las Vegas has the same basic plot.  You saw it with Elvis Presley, the Flintstones, the Saved by the Bell gang, and films like Honeymoon in Vegas and Indecent Proposal and so on.  It's no surprise the Clark is going to gamble away more than he should, put stress on his family, and win it all back at the end.It was great to see Clark, Ellen, and Cousin Eddie again together again. They could have scripted a better cinematic vehicle for them.  Forget the side stories about the kids.  The Griswold kids in this film are virtual strangers.  Wayne Newton and Beverly D'Angelo intially show promise in what what could have been a satire of INDECENT PROPOSAL, but that subplot never really goes anywhere. Randy Quaid is the sole redeeming feature of this film.There are brief flickers of the Griswold magic, but never enough to carry the whole film.

97728,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,0790731878,L.A. Scene,"[14, 16]","Usually when a movie series becomes a ""franchise"" (i.e. produces multiple sequels), it loses much of the momentum that launched the ""franchise"" to begin with.  Such is not the case with ""Vegas Vacation"" - the fourth installment of the ""Vacation"" franchise (the others being ""Vacation"", ""European Vacation"", and ""Christmas Vacation"").  1997's ""Vegas Vacation"" was the first ""Vacation"" movie in 8 years (the previous one being 1989's ""Christmas Vacation"") and it makes it well worth the wait.  The nice thing about this movie is that it basically continues a very successful formula that had been adopted for the previous three movies - and makes it work well.There is one big change for ""Vegas Vacation"" -  John Hughes is not back as the head writer.  Hughes was the head writer for the previous three ""Vacation"" movies.  Hughes was also one of the most successful writers and producers of the 1980s - involved with such hits as ""The Breakfast Club"", ""Pretty in Pink"", ""Ferris Beuller's Day Off"", ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"",  ""Weird Science"", and the ""Home Alone"" movies.  I was skeptical at first a ""Vacation"" movie could work without Hughes. However, Elisa Bell and Bob Ducsay don't drop the ball at all.  They are able to keep to the integrity of the ""Vacation"" franchise.  They are able to do this by continuing to work with the nucleus of actors that made this movie what it is - Chevy Chase (Clark Griswald), Beverly D'Angelo (Ellen Griswold), and Randy Quaid (Cousin Eddie).  Despite using the fourth different set of actor/actresses to play the Griswold Children, nothing seems to miss a beat as we immediately come to accept Rusty and Audrey Griswold early in the movie.The premise for the film is that Clark gets a big bonus and extra-time off from work for patent on a food preservative.  As a result, he decides to once again embark on a family vacation - this time to Las Vegas.  Clark touts the marketing line that was very popular during the mid 1990s - ""Las Vegas as the Family Vacation Destination"".  After some initial resistance, the family agrees to go to Vegas with him.  The trip to Vegas is the main plot, but four subplots evolve while the family is in Vegas.  Each plot focuses on one of the four Griswolds.  For Clark, he gets hooked on Gambling - and will soon rapidly rack up a very amount of Gambling losses.  For Ellen, she becomes the object of Wayne Newton's (played by himself) attention and affection.  For Rusty, after he gets a fake id - he goes on an incredibly lucky gambling streak and soon is hanging out with the high rollers.  As for Audrey, she hooks up with Cousin Eddie's wild daughter Vickie, starts to take on some of Vegas' party life and soon ends up as a Club Dancer.  Of the four subplots, the Audrey subplot is probably the weakest, but it is not all bad.  On the flipside, perhaps the best plot is the one involving Rusty.  Rusty's alter ego ""Nick Pappagiorgio"" - the High Roller provides some of the best moments in the movie.Cousins Eddie (Quaid) and Catherine (played by Miriam Flynn) are back as well.  The writers find a very good way to weave them back into the story as this time Eddie, Catherine, and their large family are living outside Las Vegas in the middle of the desert.  I like how the character of Cousin Eddie has evolved in the ""Vacation"" movies.  In the first movie, Eddie had a harder edge.  In ""Christmas Vacation"" (the producers made a foolish mistake of not finding a way to include Eddie and Catherine in ""European Vacation""), the character of Eddie began to get more loveable.  This trend continues in ""Vegas Vacation"".  I do think that the character of Eddie comes full-circle in this movie.  When Clark blows all of his money, it is Eddie that not only provides emotional support to Clark - but even finds a way to help him out financially as well.  This is a great turnaround because in the previous films, it was Clark that was usually helping Eddie out.Another notable performance comes from a little known actor named Wallace Shawn.  Wallace plays ""Marty"" who is a dealer in the Casino.  Clark begins to engage in a war of wills with Marty throughout the movie - and it's Marty who always seems to get the best of him.  It is also worth noting that Christie Brinkley, who was in the original ""Vacation"" movie is back for a brief cameo - reprising her role from the original movie.For the most part, the movie was filmed within Las Vegas.  The majority of the scenes take place in The Mirage Hotel (including a performance by Sigfried and Roy in which Clark manages to find his way into the act).  There are some other scenes that take place at the MGM, Riviera, Golden Nugget, and O'Shea's Casino.  There are plenty of scenes of the strip.  One inaccuacy is when the Griswolds go to visit Eddie and Catherine's place just North of Las Vegas, they actually drive southbound on the strip - just past the Luxor.There are two drawbacks to the movie.  I do think there is less physical comedy in this movie than in previous ""Vacation"" films - particularly of Clark.  Clark's best physical comedy scenes come before they leave for the Vegas trip.  The other drawback is I do think the movie has a weak ending (despite a small appearance by Sid Caesar).  In general while I have always enjoyed the ""Vacation"" movies, the endings have been disappointing in each of them.There is some excellent music in this movie and it is used very well with the scenes - including a combination of some contemporary tunes with some ""Vegas"" style tunes.  Overall, this is still probably one of the better ""Vacation"" movies - definitely one worth getting and watching over and over.",4,Another Solid Outing with the Griswolds,1111276800,"03 20,

I haven't. Nowhere NEAR infact. But the person I was watching it with was actually saying he'd sat at this bar, and been there, and done that etc. So it would be easier if you'd been there before. But it kept my attention for most of the film. Which makes it a whole lot better than Christmas Vacation 2!Two of my favourite scenes in this is where Audrey's dancing on top of that big sign, just cos she's so funny, and although it's corny dancing, it looks like fun! Also, the little in-joke where Clark tells Rusty and Audrey that he hardly recognises them anymore, a reference to having different actors play the Griswold children in each of the four movies. I actually GOT that bit, so I was quite proud of myself. In this movie Rusty and Audrey are twins (making them the same age) in the first two Vacation movies Rusty is the older sibling and in Christmas Vacation Audrey is the older sibling.If you're a fan of Friends (I'm a sucker for spotting these people!), look out for Larry Hankin right at the end, when Clark & Ellen get re-married, he marries them. Who's he again? He was Mr Heckles in the early series' of Friends!What really shocked me about this movie was how much Chevy Chase has aged.

In typical Clark Griswold fashion, all of the disasters turn into better fortune in the end, this time being on the winning end of a keno ticket. Clark gambles away the family savings, only to get it back, while Rusty has unbelievable luck as an underage first-time gambler. Ellen falls for Wayne Newton (a tad quirky side story) while Audry works as a dancer. Of course, what would a movie like this be without cousin Eddie? By exaggerated and inaccurate dealer etiquette, Clark is belittled and simultaneously influenced to gamble more, and loses the money and dignity of his family, only to run into a lonely man who wishes he had a family, and dies moments after winning the keno jackpot, but tells Clark to take the winning ticket.

Although it is funny when Ellen falls for Wain Newton, and when Clark goes to Hoover Dam with the rest of the family, AND when Rusty (their son) wins 4 cars,- it just can't beat those hilariously laugh-making 'Vacation' films that appeared in theatres about.. what?-  15 YEARS AGO?! I mean, if you are going to make a 4th one, make it a little better,...'cause people need it to be pretty darn good if you make a 4th 'Vacation'.  Starring: Chevy Chase (as usual), Beverly D'Angelo, and Randy Quaid.  I give it a B.  Check out my other reviews for: 'National Lampoon's Vacation', 'The Family Man', 'Romy and Michelle's Highschool Reunion', 'CON AIR', 'Finding Forrester', 'SCREAM 3', and many many more!",3,"Funny, but it doesn't have that hilarious '80s formula",980467200,"01 26, 2001",2001,920,"[""Vacation'-"", 'movie', 'made', '8', 'years', '3rd', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'quot', 'Vacation', 'quot', 'Christmas', 'Vacation', '1989', 'just', 'NOT', 'have', 'funny', 'original', 'stupid', ""'80s"", 'humor', 'other', '3', 'are', 'filled', 'funny', 'when', 'Ellen', 'Wain', 'Newton', 'when', 'Clark', 'Hoover', 'Dam', 'rest', 'family', 'when', 'Rusty', 'son', '4', 'cars', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'hilariously', 'laugh-making', ""'Vacation"", 'films', 'appeared', 'theatres', 'about..', 'what', '15', 'YEARS', 'AGO', 'mean', 'are', 'going', 'make', '4th', 'one', 'make', 'little', 'better', ""'cause"", 'people', 'need', 'be', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'make', '4th', ""'Vacation"", 'Starring', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'usual', 'Beverly', ""D'Angelo"", 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'give', 'B', 'Check', 'other', 'reviews', ""'National"", 'Lampoon', 'Vacation', 'Family', 'Man', ""'Romy"", 'Michelle', 'Highschool', 'Reunion', ""'CON"", 'AIR', ""'Finding"", 'Forrester', '3', 'many', 'many', 'more']",N/A
