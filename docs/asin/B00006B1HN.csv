710790,A2GZVA22WYG95I,B00006B1HN,J. Olsen,"[0, 0]","The movie opens with a young boy rescued from a fall from a tree by what appears to be a flying reindeer. He never forgets this experience, becoming fascinated with flight and eventually becoming a pilot.Flash forward to this boy as an adult. Richard Thomas plays the part and is a college professor up for tenure. Things are riding on a paper he is to present on the flying squirrel, about which he is an expert. However, as he works on the paper late one night a student brings him a gift as a thank you for all the help he has given her. It is a book from a century before written by one of her ancestors about his research on flying reindeer. It has a strange attraction for him and he becomes obsessed with completing the research and proving that reindeer can indeed fly, neglecting his work for tenure and spending night after night at his office--even forgetting Thanksgiving. Just days before his paper is due (and also just days before Christmas) his wife discovers his deception. She is hurt by his lying and letting her believe he had been working all this time on the ""flying squirrel"" paper. She takes their daughter, with whom he had a very close relationship, and goes to live with her mother.He goes to Alaska and charters a plane to try and find the location of the flying reindeer, based on the information in the book he had been given. His search seems fruitless, and just as he is about to turn around due to low fuel, he spots a reindeer flying in front of him. He follows it, running out of fuel and crashing in the frozen wasteland.*Spoiler Alert*He is rescued by an elf who takes him to Santa's village. He is thrilled with the discovery that reindeer can fly and that Santa is real. He begins taking photos and documenting what he sees. Then his camera disappears and he finds he is basically a captive of St. Nick and the elves--he is free to move about the village, anywhere except the ""True believer's room,"" but they can't let him go back for the very fact that he would try to prove to the world that they exist.He misses his wife and daughter and is determined to do anything he can to get back home. He is also determined to get into the one room forbidden him. In the process of both quests he jeopardizes Santa's secrets.All the while he is trying to get home, his wife and daughter are in Alaska trying to find him. With some help from Santa and in spite of the U.S. Air Force, things are resolved nicely.Though obviously a Christmas fantasy (in the spirit of ""The Night They Saved Christmas"" and ""One Magic Christmas"") nothing is played in an over-the-top manner. The acting is well done, and it is a very family-friendly, entertaining Christmas journey.",4,Surprisingly good,1287619200,"10 21, 2010",2010,2692,"['movie', 'young', 'boy', 'rescued', 'fall', 'tree', 'what', 'be', 'flying', 'reindeer', 'never', 'experience', 'becoming', 'fascinated', 'flight', 'eventually', 'becoming', 'pilot.Flash', 'forward', 'boy', 'adult', 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'part', 'college', 'professor', 'up', 'tenure', 'Things', 'are', 'riding', 'paper', 'present', 'flying', 'squirrel', 'about', 'expert', 'However', 'paper', 'late', 'one', 'night', 'student', 'gift', 'thank', 'help', 'given', 'book', 'century', 'written', 'one', 'ancestors', 'research', 'flying', 'reindeer', 'strange', 'attraction', 'obsessed', 'completing', 'research', 'proving', 'reindeer', 'can', 'indeed', 'fly', 'neglecting', 'work', 'tenure', 'spending', 'night', 'night', 'office', 'even', 'forgetting', 'Thanksgiving', 'Just', 'days', 'paper', 'due', 'also', 'just', 'days', 'Christmas', 'wife', 'deception', 'hurt', 'lying', 'letting', 'believe', 'had', 'been', 'working', 'time', 'flying', 'squirrel', 'paper', 'daughter', 'whom', 'had', 'very', 'close', 'relationship', 'live', 'mother.He', 'Alaska', 'charters', 'plane', 'try', 'find', 'location', 'flying', 'reindeer', 'based', 'information', 'book', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'search', 'fruitless', 'just', 'turn', 'around', 'due', 'low', 'fuel', 'spots', 'reindeer', 'flying', 'front', 'running', 'fuel', 'crashing', 'frozen', 'wasteland', '*Spoiler', 'Alert*He', 'rescued', 'elf', 'who', 'Santa', 'village', 'thrilled', 'discovery', 'reindeer', 'can', 'fly', 'Santa', 'real', 'taking', 'photos', 'documenting', 'what', 'Then', 'camera', 'basically', 'captive', 'St.', 'Nick', 'elves', 'free', 'move', 'village', 'anywhere', 'True', 'believer', 'room', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'back', 'very', 'fact', 'would', 'try', 'prove', 'world', 'exist.He', 'wife', 'daughter', 'determined', 'do', 'anything', 'can', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'also', 'determined', 'get', 'one', 'room', 'process', 'quests', 'Santa', 'secrets.All', 'while', 'trying', 'get', 'home', 'wife', 'daughter', 'are', 'Alaska', 'trying', 'find', 'help', 'Santa', 'spite', 'U.S.', 'Air', 'Force', 'things', 'are', 'resolved', 'nicely.Though', 'obviously', 'Christmas', 'fantasy', 'spirit', 'Night', 'Saved', 'Christmas', 'One', 'Magic', 'Christmas', 'nothing', 'played', 'over-the-top', 'manner', 'acting', 'well', 'done', 'very', 'family-friendly', 'entertaining', 'Christmas', 'journey']",N/A

It has been one of my favorites since I saw it. I waited and waited for it to come out in DVD. I ordered it when it came out with a copy for USA. I could hardly wait till it arrived(quicker than I expected). I sat down and went to watch the same day it arrived. It didn't work in the player or my husband's laptop. I contacted seller and explained the situation. It was solved very quicklyand I was very pleased with my purchase. The attitude of the seller was excellent towards solving the problem.
