They together starred in SILVER STREAK(1976) and STIR CRAZY(1980). Wally Carou(Pryor) is blind. David Lyons(Wilder) is deaf. Wally applies for a position as a sales associate in David's magazine stand. After a customer,Wally's bookie,is threateningly shot to death by a beautiful woman named Eve(Joan Severance),Wally and David witness the customer's dead body and are framed for the murder which they were not responsible for. There are many silly scenes in this film.One where David and Wally fake foreign accents. Also,when eating ice cream on cones in the park,Wally crowns David with his(Wally's) cone and in the last scene,in that same park,David does the same to Wally. It was so funny when David labeled Wally in another scene as a &quot;blind egotistical ---hole who denies he can't see s--t&quot;. David and Wally end up framing Eve with the help of Wally's sister Adele(Kirsten Childs). Gene Wilder met his current wife while filming this movie in 1988. He was then married to comedienne Gilda Radner who died of ovarian cancer at age 42 in May 1989,the month this film was theatrically released. Stewart Copeland of the rock band The Police wrote the soundtrack music for this film. There's also a scene where Wally and David &quot;go on a cable ride&quot;.

Wilder plays a deaf man, while Pryor plays a blind man.  The pair meet and become unwittingly involved in a criminal enterprise over a rare and valuable gold coin.  The main bad guys are played by Kevin Spacey and Joan Severance.  Spacey is modestly good as a villain.  However, Severance, despite her knock-out body and a nice nude scene, is lackluster and almost drone-like in her portrayal of the vixen.

It is highly UN PC but never actually offensive and at time highly uproarious! With a great soundtrack by Stewart Copeland of 'Police' fame and expert direction from Arthur Hiller (Silver Streak) 'See No Evil, Hear No Evil' is an above average comedy that is in many ways just as good as 'Stir Crazy'. Give it a chance, it is bound to grow on you!With that said, this review is going to focus on the video and audio quality of this Blu ray presentation and not the film itself.'See No Evil, Hear No Evil' is simply GORGEOUS on Blu ray. I own hundreds of BD discs and this is without a doubt one of the best catalog transfers I have ever seen. Crystal clear, great color w/ original color timing, no motion artifacts, almost perfect contrast, and no DNR or edge enhancement. For this type of release you will just never see a better looking transfer. A nice healthy 32 Mbits average bit rate and an uncompressed 2.0 sound track that sounds great decoded to Dolby Pro Logic II.Honestly, I am blown away by the quality of the video here. If all my 80's films looked this good I would be in 7th Heaven. Easily outshines 95% of all the BD's I own. Hats off to whoever scanned this one! GREAT JOB!!!OK, I am blown away by the picture quality, how about the audio?Again, another winner here folks. Granted, we are only given the original stereo track, but it is 16 bit LPCM and uncompressed and sounds great. Music, effects and dialogue are all top notch. Nothing but quality here folks. What a welcome treat after many ""dud"" discs that cost an arm and a leg.Honestly, this Blu Ray presentation is a text book case for how to do it RIGHT on these minor catalog titles. REALLY GREAT!There are no special features of any kind, no trailers either. Subtitles ARE included.'See No Evil, Hear No Evil' is not likely to ever win any awards, but it is solid comedy and the chemistry between Richard and Gene is UNDENIABLE in this one folks.  Yes, it is very VERY UN PC, but it is a refreshing change and holds up to repeated viewings.  For the current asking price of well under 10 bucks this Blu ray is a real deal. It's a shame 'Stir Crazy' can't come close to the picture quality provided here.Marty G's most highest recommendation for fans of the actors, the film or both.
