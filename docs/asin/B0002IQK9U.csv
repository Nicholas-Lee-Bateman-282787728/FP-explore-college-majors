836139,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0002IQK9U,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[17, 42]","This was a horrible film.  I do not mean to come right out and say that, but it honestly is the most jumbled mess of ideas, conspiracies, and logic to ever be called a documentary.  When I watch these types of films, I expect them to be similar to a college thesis paper.  I want to see a riveting introduction, a powerful THESIS statement followed by some strong supportive points to back up the thesis, and finally a gut-wrenching conclusion.  I want to sit in my couch and be able to pick my jaw off the floor and be in awe of the brilliance of the reporting.  That was not the case with The Hunting of the President.  I don't even think that filmmakers Nickolas Perry and Harry Thomason knew what they were doing.  They had this idea, they had the clips and interviews done, now all they had to do was put the film together ... and they failed.To begin, this film assumes (and you know what happens when you assume) that you know most of the facts about White Water and the Lewinsky trial.  It assumes that you know the key players; that you were one of the thousands glued to your televisions during all of this public embarrassment.  Strangely, it even assumes that you know the people behind the scenes.  That you know most of the points already, this film just gives you a platform to watch them without commercials.  This is way too much assuming for me.  I did not keep up with the Clinton debacle that much because it was his personal business.  I was more interested about what our leader had to say about issues like ... terrorism and foreign policy than worry about who he was sleeping with.  If Hillary was willing to forgive him, then I think the American public should do the same.  But ... I digress, I promised I wouldn't go too far into personal beliefs.  Nonetheless, this film does a horrible job of bringing the facts out into the open, and the little facts that they do they do not go too deeply into detail because they (again) assume that we already know it.  This was my first issue with this documentary.My second issue was their choice of filler.  Throughout this film there were snippets of films and filmed moments to help bring some humor and levity to the thesis.  While some may consider this a bandwagon jump onto what Michael Moore tries to do in his film, I saw it as something my college Professor would have called ""fluff"".  These directors were avoiding, or trying to make light of a very powerful subject.  If they were serious about this film, they would have either chosen to use different clips or dropped them all together.  They were annoying and a waste of time ... maybe it was symbolic for this film?Next, was the time.  This film ran just short of 90 minutes.  That is not enough time to fully develop your points and make bold statements.  Through some issues we were forced to run through to cover enough ground.  I continually had to check my remote to make sure that it wasn't on fast forward.  For a majority of this film, I felt as if I was running through a maze with some clippers.  Whenever I came to a dead end in this maze, instead of backtracking and using logic to get me through the puzzle, I would just use the clippers to make my own path.  That is exactly what this film did.  When it got caught in a trap, it just clipped its way out and started a different path.  Nothing was coherent, substantial, or knowledgeable in this film.  I wanted meat, and all I got was soup.There were only two points in this film that I found interesting.  The first was everything that happened to Susan McDougal.  It was sad and devastating to hear and see a woman who went through hell after doing nothing-wrong what so ever.  This was one of the points that I thought the Republicans could not back out on.  They wronged this woman, and owe her so much of her life.The second point that was interesting to watch was when the media decided to release the impeachment trial on Clinton ironically on the same day as Clinton was to give a speech to the UN about ... well ... terrorism.  I think that it is only now that we see that perhaps this man knew more about our future than our current President and wanted to be proactive instead of reactive.Outside of these points, this was a pretty poor documentary even during this time when we, the film community, are being blasted by more and more political documentaries.  It was obvious that they had plenty of money to spend on Morgan Freeman, I only wish they had budgeted more towards the basics of the film.Overall, a waste of time.Grade: * out of *****",1,The ten-year campaign to destroy Bill Clinton.,1096848000,"10 4, 2004",2004,4555,"['was', 'horrible', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'mean', 'come', 'right', 'say', 'honestly', 'most', 'jumbled', 'mess', 'ideas', 'conspiracies', 'logic', 'ever', 'be', 'called', 'documentary', 'When', 'watch', 'types', 'films', 'expect', 'be', 'similar', 'college', 'thesis', 'paper', 'want', 'see', 'riveting', 'introduction', 'powerful', 'THESIS', 'statement', 'followed', 'strong', 'supportive', 'points', 'back', 'up', 'thesis', 'finally', 'gut-wrenching', 'conclusion', 'want', 'sit', 'couch', 'be', 'able', 'pick', 'jaw', 'floor', 'be', 'awe', 'brilliance', 'reporting', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'Hunting', 'President', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'Nickolas', 'Perry', 'Harry', 'Thomason', 'knew', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'had', 'idea', 'had', 'clips', 'interviews', 'done', 'now', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'put', 'film', 'together', 'failed.To', 'begin', 'film', 'know', 'what', 'when', 'assume', 'know', 'most', 'facts', 'White', 'Water', 'Lewinsky', 'trial', 'know', 'key', 'players', 'were', 'one', 'thousands', 'glued', 'televisions', 'public', 'embarrassment', 'Strangely', 'even', 'know', 'people', 'scenes', 'know', 'most', 'points', 'already', 'film', 'just', 'platform', 'watch', 'commercials', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'assuming', 'did', 'not', 'keep', 'up', 'Clinton', 'debacle', 'much', 'was', 'personal', 'business', 'was', 'more', 'interested', 'what', 'leader', 'had', 'say', 'issues', 'terrorism', 'foreign', 'policy', 'worry', 'who', 'was', 'sleeping', 'Hillary', 'was', 'willing', 'forgive', 'then', 'think', 'American', 'public', 'should', 'do', 'same', 'digress', 'promised', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'far', 'personal', 'beliefs', 'Nonetheless', 'film', 'horrible', 'job', 'bringing', 'facts', 'out', 'open', 'little', 'facts', 'do', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'too', 'deeply', 'detail', 'again', 'assume', 'already', 'know', 'was', 'first', 'issue', 'documentary.My', 'second', 'issue', 'was', 'choice', 'filler', 'film', 'were', 'snippets', 'films', 'filmed', 'moments', 'help', 'bring', 'humor', 'levity', 'thesis', 'may', 'consider', 'bandwagon', 'jump', 'what', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'tries', 'do', 'film', 'saw', 'something', 'college', 'Professor', 'would', 'have', 'called', 'fluff', 'directors', 'were', 'avoiding', 'trying', 'make', 'light', 'very', 'powerful', 'subject', 'were', 'serious', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'chosen', 'use', 'different', 'clips', 'dropped', 'together', 'were', 'annoying', 'waste', 'time', 'maybe', 'was', 'symbolic', 'film', 'Next', 'was', 'time', 'film', 'ran', 'just', 'short', '90', 'minutes', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'fully', 'develop', 'points', 'make', 'bold', 'statements', 'issues', 'were', 'forced', 'run', 'cover', 'enough', 'ground', 'continually', 'had', 'check', 'remote', 'make', 'sure', 'was', ""n't"", 'fast', 'forward', 'majority', 'film', 'felt', 'was', 'running', 'maze', 'clippers', 'Whenever', 'came', 'dead', 'end', 'maze', 'instead', 'backtracking', 'using', 'logic', 'get', 'puzzle', 'would', 'just', 'use', 'clippers', 'make', 'own', 'path', 'exactly', 'what', 'film', 'did', 'When', 'got', 'caught', 'trap', 'just', 'clipped', 'way', 'started', 'different', 'path', 'Nothing', 'was', 'coherent', 'substantial', 'knowledgeable', 'film', 'wanted', 'meat', 'got', 'was', 'soup.There', 'were', 'only', 'two', 'points', 'film', 'found', 'interesting', 'first', 'was', 'everything', 'happened', 'Susan', 'McDougal', 'was', 'sad', 'devastating', 'hear', 'see', 'woman', 'who', 'went', 'hell', 'doing', 'nothing-wrong', 'what', 'so', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'points', 'thought', 'Republicans', 'could', 'not', 'back', 'out', 'wronged', 'woman', 'owe', 'so', 'much', 'life.The', 'second', 'point', 'was', 'interesting', 'watch', 'was', 'when', 'media', 'decided', 'release', 'impeachment', 'trial', 'Clinton', 'ironically', 'same', 'day', 'Clinton', 'was', 'give', 'speech', 'UN', 'well', 'terrorism', 'think', 'only', 'now', 'see', 'perhaps', 'man', 'knew', 'more', 'future', 'current', 'President', 'wanted', 'be', 'proactive', 'instead', 'reactive.Outside', 'points', 'was', 'pretty', 'poor', 'documentary', 'even', 'time', 'when', 'film', 'community', 'are', 'being', 'blasted', 'more', 'more', 'political', 'documentaries', 'was', 'obvious', 'had', 'plenty', 'money', 'spend', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'only', 'wish', 'had', 'budgeted', 'more', 'basics', 'film.Overall', 'waste', 'time.Grade', '*', '*****']",N/A

Less a vindication of Clinton than an indictment of the press, ""Hunting"" provides a timely commentary on the excesses of journalistic zeal that almost brought down a presidency.  I was especially moved by the story of Susan McDougal, aka Joan of the Ozarks, who was treated like a serial killer during her near-two years in prison, after she ran afoul of nasty-minded Ken Starr and his minions.  I also liked the brave and witty portrait of ex-Arkansas Governor Riley's wife, Claudia.

""The Hunting Of the President"" unseats the word ""theory"" with ""evident"".  The neo-conservatist attack on Bill Clinton by GOP Republicans found nothing but sex stains; no illegal activity whatsoever.  Their invasion of Clinton's privacy resembles the attack of the White Witch of ""The Lion, the Witch, And the Wardrobe"" where Aslan, the lion, sacrifices himself to the queen to protect the four children of that C.S. Lewis story.  The lion is sacrificed, but comes back because he was innocent.  Clinton, too, was exonerated from a legislative impeachment to which I can't even remember the accusation.  He didn't argue with the legislature (unlike President George W. Bush who, like a Nixon failing, continues to cite executive priveledge to Congress without any legal basis).  President Clinton submitted because the law asked him (or required him).  He didn't run for cover and camouflage (unlike President G.W. Bush).  Can anyone guess why?  He didn't run because he wasn't guilty (also unlike G.W. Bush).I tell you what I see in history.  I see a bunch of these GOP neo-conservatives falling into guilty sentences in courts of law, and so many more investigations of Republicans and Republican affiliates.  Then, on the other side, I rarely see ANY court convictions.  Maybe saying this makes me look like I must be partisan to make this claim, but no.  Why do I have to be partisan to notice that most of the people conducting illegal activity are neo-conservatives of or affiliating to the Republican party?  Gee, I guess it's because that's a RAP THEY EARN!  If I'm biased, I'm being fair!Let's see, um...  Oliver North, Republican ballot of Virginia.  Nixon, Republican.  Newt Gingrich, Republican speaker.  Kenneth Lay, friends of Republicans like G.W. Bush.  The bin Ladens, friends of Republicans like G.W. Bush.  Jack Abramoff, friends of Republican legislators.  Harry Whittington, an intoxicated Dick Cheney shot him with a 28-gauge shotgun while quail hunting.Dick Cheney later told everyone he would like to accept the blame as an irresponsible hunting accident, but if he wasn't running around with a shotgun, he wouldn't have shot anyone.  He would like to say his blame came from his misuse of a shotgun.  (Well, everyone already gathered that, Dick!)  To paraphrase George Carlin, the animals don't think it's a sport.Michael Moore?  Enemy of the state.

836142,A2C27IQUH9N1Z,B0002IQK9U,audrey,"[71, 82]","This expose by Harry Thomason, friend of Bill Clinton, is biased but authoritative -- believable primarily because it is filled with first-person accounts of the efforts to bring down the Clinton presidency.  We hear from former right-wing hatchet man David Brock, Arkansas residents familiar with the disreputable sources who would say anything to hurt Clinton or get a stay in a fancy hotel, Paula Jones' lawyers, participants in the Arkansas Project, editors and journalists, and many others.Remember that this was a twice-elected president, and taxpayers had to foot the bill for multiple investigations that lasted over 5 years and cost over $50 million, and NOTHING WAS FOUND AGAINST CLINTON EXCEPT LYING ABOUT AN AFFAIR.  We should be outraged, not at Clinton's behavior (as bad as it was), but that conservatives tried to impeach an elected president!  This happens in banana republics, NOT in America, right?!The film also gives Susan McDougal her due.  A victim of heartless ideologues, she was told she would go to prison unless she cooperated and made statements against Clinton THAT WOULD BE SUPPLIED FOR HER.  They put her in death row garb so that she would be abused by the other inmates, and disobeyed a judge's order to move her to another prison; in the meantime, Ken Starr went on to become president of Pepperdine Law School, funded by Richard Mellon Scaife, the fanatic who financed much of the vile anti-Clinton campaign.  Who is more corrupt here?Amazingly, in the disk's only extra (other than a trailer), a 43-minute talk by Clinton at the film's premiere, he tells supporters that we should not use the same techniques, that we should not try to personalize attacks, but that we should insist on a civil debate of the issues, because we will prevail.  As in the 90s, the Clintons show more class than the conservative ideologues could ever dream of having.The film can be heard in English and subtitled in English or Spanish.",5,expose of the 'vast right wing conspiracy',1096588800,"10 1, 2004",2004,1952,"['expose', 'Harry', 'Thomason', 'friend', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'biased', 'authoritative', 'believable', 'primarily', 'filled', 'first-person', 'accounts', 'efforts', 'bring', 'down', 'Clinton', 'presidency', 'hear', 'former', 'right-wing', 'hatchet', 'man', 'David', 'Brock', 'Arkansas', 'residents', 'familiar', 'disreputable', 'sources', 'who', 'would', 'say', 'anything', 'hurt', 'Clinton', 'get', 'stay', 'fancy', 'hotel', 'Paula', 'Jones', 'lawyers', 'participants', 'Arkansas', 'Project', 'editors', 'journalists', 'many', 'others.Remember', 'was', 'twice-elected', 'president', 'taxpayers', 'had', 'foot', 'bill', 'multiple', 'investigations', 'lasted', '5', 'years', 'cost', '50', 'million', 'NOTHING', 'WAS', 'FOUND', 'AGAINST', 'CLINTON', 'EXCEPT', 'LYING', 'ABOUT', 'AN', 'AFFAIR', 'should', 'be', 'outraged', 'not', 'Clinton', 'behavior', 'as', 'bad', 'was', 'tried', 'impeach', 'elected', 'president', 'banana', 'republics', 'NOT', 'America', 'right', 'film', 'also', 'Susan', 'McDougal', 'due', 'victim', 'heartless', 'ideologues', 'was', 'told', 'would', 'go', 'prison', 'cooperated', 'made', 'statements', 'Clinton', 'THAT', 'WOULD', 'BE', 'SUPPLIED', 'FOR', 'HER', 'put', 'death', 'row', 'garb', 'would', 'be', 'abused', 'other', 'inmates', 'disobeyed', 'judge', 'order', 'move', 'prison', 'meantime', 'Ken', 'Starr', 'went', 'become', 'president', 'Pepperdine', 'Law', 'School', 'funded', 'Richard', 'Mellon', 'Scaife', 'fanatic', 'who', 'financed', 'much', 'vile', 'anti-Clinton', 'campaign', 'Who', 'more', 'corrupt', 'here', 'Amazingly', 'disk', 'only', 'extra', 'other', 'trailer', '43-minute', 'talk', 'Clinton', 'film', 'premiere', 'supporters', 'should', 'not', 'use', 'same', 'techniques', 'should', 'not', 'try', 'personalize', 'attacks', 'should', 'insist', 'civil', 'debate', 'issues', 'will', 'prevail', '90s', 'Clintons', 'show', 'more', 'class', 'conservative', 'ideologues', 'could', 'ever', 'dream', 'having.The', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'English', 'subtitled', 'English', 'Spanish']",N/A

How the media goes with the hype and looks at stories more as red meat rather than media worthy. The movie opened this week in Sacramento, CA at the Crest Theatre, and I hope it comes to Stockton CA which is easier for me to get to for a return showing. And its a college town.It is also a cautionary tale of a movie (read the book for more in-depth reasoning) of how special interests can have a seek and destroy at any cost mentality.  Whitewater being the case in point. According to the General Accounting Office (GAO) the cost of the independent counsel's 4 1/2-year inquiry of the president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton came to $39.2 million. And they got nothing.Susan McDougal, is shown (correctly) as being targeted by right wing extremists who assumed that being from Arkansas that she could be brought down easily, and that it must have come as a surprise when she stood her ground and being innocent was willing to go to jail for contempt rather than hell for lying.And the movie shows both sides fairly in my opinion, with the main focus being on the evils of what actually happened and a warning IMO that if it could happen to the Clintons, beware it could happen to anyone.

And during most of his years, he was forced to fight back against his countless political enemies. This documentary, based on the book of the same name, details some of the people and the organizations who were dead set against Bill Clinton and were on a mission to stop him by using any available means.Many prominent people speak on this documentary. Longtime Clinton associates like Paul Begala, Susan McDougal, and others come to his defense, showing how the Clinton bashers misled the public and went on a smear campaign to bring Clinton down. One scandal after another was created in the hope that the American people and the world would despise Clinton as much as his enemies did.The main weapon of choice used by the anti- Clinton crusaders was sex. The documentary talks about the different allegations of sexual misconduct, but it never gets into an analysis as to why sex was the chosen area to target with Clinton. It was known that Clinton loved the ladies and that he was often surrounded by ""groupies"" due to his political popularity. But still, using sex seems an unlikely choice because it has nothing to do with the president's job performance as president. I think the enemies chose sex because most of the organizations were socially conservative in nature and they knew that this type of allegation would infuriate their members more than any other. It would have been nice to hear a deeper analysis of this issue.Some key Republicans are mentioned in this documentary, but they don't say much. I think the director could have driven his point home better if he had included actual statements from actual Republicans, allowing them to incriminate themselves right on camera. This missing element, and the fact that there are no facts presented from the other side, makes this documentary a little less appealing than it would otherwise be.Another thing missing here is an element of humor. Michael Moore has produced many documentaries and, even though I don't always agree with the stands he takes, the added humor makes them more enjoyable. With this documentary, the mood remains serious throughout. And the only ""star"" in this documentary is Morgan Freeman, who narrates. Other than him, there is little here that would qualify this as a major Hollywood production and for this reason, some viewers will not like it due to its limited entertainment value.Overall, this is a good documentary but it could have been better with a few changes and enhancements. Ninety minutes isn't really long enough to tell a story like Clinton's, but this documentary at least gives the viewer something to think about. Clinton was far from perfect, but the constant onslaught from his political enemies bordered on obsession and this documentary does a decent job explaining the deceptive tactics used by the anti- Clinton forces to bring Bill's reign to an end.",3,Bill Clinton's Non- Stop Political Fight,1111536000,"03 23, 2005",2005,2919,"['Bill', 'Clinton', 'spent', 'many', 'years', 'public', 'office', 'most', 'years', 'was', 'forced', 'fight', 'back', 'countless', 'political', 'enemies', 'documentary', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'details', 'people', 'organizations', 'who', 'were', 'dead', 'set', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'were', 'mission', 'stop', 'using', 'available', 'means.Many', 'prominent', 'people', 'speak', 'documentary', 'Longtime', 'Clinton', 'associates', 'Paul', 'Begala', 'Susan', 'McDougal', 'others', 'come', 'defense', 'showing', 'how', 'Clinton', 'bashers', 'misled', 'public', 'went', 'smear', 'campaign', 'bring', 'Clinton', 'down', 'One', 'scandal', 'was', 'created', 'hope', 'American', 'people', 'world', 'would', 'despise', 'Clinton', 'as', 'much', 'enemies', 'did.The', 'main', 'weapon', 'choice', 'used', 'anti-', 'Clinton', 'crusaders', 'was', 'sex', 'documentary', 'talks', 'different', 'allegations', 'sexual', 'misconduct', 'never', 'analysis', 'why', 'sex', 'was', 'chosen', 'area', 'target', 'Clinton', 'was', 'known', 'Clinton', 'loved', 'ladies', 'was', 'often', 'surrounded', 'groupies', 'due', 'political', 'popularity', 'still', 'using', 'sex', 'unlikely', 'choice', 'nothing', 'do', 'president', 'job', 'performance', 'president', 'think', 'enemies', 'chose', 'sex', 'most', 'organizations', 'were', 'socially', 'conservative', 'nature', 'knew', 'type', 'allegation', 'would', 'infuriate', 'members', 'more', 'other', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'hear', 'deeper', 'analysis', 'issue.Some', 'key', 'Republicans', 'are', 'mentioned', 'documentary', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'think', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'driven', 'point', 'home', 'better', 'had', 'included', 'actual', 'statements', 'actual', 'Republicans', 'allowing', 'incriminate', 'right', 'camera', 'missing', 'element', 'fact', 'are', 'facts', 'presented', 'other', 'side', 'little', 'less', 'appealing', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be.Another', 'thing', 'missing', 'here', 'element', 'humor', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'produced', 'many', 'documentaries', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'agree', 'stands', 'added', 'humor', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'documentary', 'mood', 'serious', 'only', 'star', 'documentary', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'who', 'Other', 'little', 'here', 'would', 'qualify', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'reason', 'viewers', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'due', 'limited', 'entertainment', 'value.Overall', 'good', 'documentary', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'few', 'changes', 'enhancements', 'Ninety', 'minutes', ""n't"", 'really', 'long', 'enough', 'tell', 'story', 'Clinton', 'documentary', 'least', 'viewer', 'something', 'think', 'Clinton', 'was', 'far', 'perfect', 'constant', 'onslaught', 'political', 'enemies', 'bordered', 'obsession', 'documentary', 'decent', 'job', 'explaining', 'deceptive', 'tactics', 'used', 'anti-', 'Clinton', 'forces', 'bring', 'Bill', 'reign', 'end']",N/A

Therefore a more 'condensed' version is an important part of spreading the truth about what went on in this country in the late nineties when the Republicans found they had twice been voted out of the Oval Office where they believe they have inherited rights.  It puts more of their current behavior into historical perspective, and explains why many Republicans of good faith could not support George II on his second run.Second of all, it's important to support this type of documentary no matter what your politics if you want some sort of independent voice to survive in America.  It's true that the movie cannot cover in detail all of the abuses documented both in the Conason/Lyons book or in the Jeffrey Toobin book.  However, the interviews and story of Susan MacDougall alone are  worth the time and the price of the  film.  MacDougall's sincerity and good faith come through starkely in this movie in a much more powerful fashion than through the written word.Some of the pictures of the individuals involved speaking in interviews or on newsreels are much  more powerful than on the printed page....a  picture is definitely worth a thousand words, and this is a VERY convincing  documentary with a great deal of power for those interested in the future of our democracy.Even many who think they know a lot about politics will be surprised by much of the testimony in this documentary.

836150,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0002IQK9U,Ed Uyeshima,"[39, 45]","Overlooked among the plethora of anti-Bush DVDs currently on the market before the election, this documentary takes an intriguing look at the purported plot to destroy the career of Bill Clinton by what Hillary claimed was a ""vast right-wing conspiracy"".  Given that this was co-directed by famous ""Friend of Bill"" Harry Thomason, along with Nickolas Perry, one can hardly expect a completely impartial view of its subject. Consequently, it is unlikely to change the minds of any staunch Republicans out there already critical of the Clinton presidency. At the same time, the film does provide important context for a lot of the more unsavory details surrounding his case than some of the more conservative media would have you believe. The result is an intriguing examination of a President scrutinized with unprecedented zeal.Although the film begins with Clinton's early days in Arkansas state government, its focus is on two of the more damaging episodes in his political career, the Whitewater scandal and the attempted impeachment trial based on his sexual escapades before and during his White House years. Many of those involved in both scandals are featured here through news clips with a few of them newly interviewed. Surprisingly the events do not reflect an overly biased perspective, thus showing a warts-and-all portrait of a flawed man though a reconstruction of sorts. Whether or not you agree with what is presented, the filmmakers do a convincing job of backing up their portrayal with some less than flattering footage of the Clinton years. The use of dramatic re-creations and clips from a variety of Hollywood movies sometimes undermines the film's seriousness, but they don't minimize the points raised. Some of the higher profile personalities in the anti-Clinton camp come off poorly but according to the evidence presented, justifiably so - Paula Jones is seen as a fame-seeking narcissist, while Kenneth Starr is portrayed as a ruthless opportunist obsessed with his agenda and indifferent to the damage his tactics incur upon his duty in serving the public trust. On the other side, former Clinton advisor James Carville sums up accurately the documentary's main question, i.e., how much money should be spent on a clearly partisan effort to pull a virtual ""coup d'&eacute;tat"" against an elected American president? Probably the most telling moments belong to Susan McDougal, whose refusal to cooperate with Starr on the Whitewater case led to her serving two years in a maximum-security prison. She recounts her prison experiences with piercing and often horrifying detail.Unfortunately, the Monica Lewinsky affair is given short shrift in the film, a sad omission, as this was the one development that expedited Clinton's fall from grace. Nevertheless, the film also illustrates his amazing resilience in rising above the political fray. In fact, Clinton himself provides clear evidence of this in an interesting supplement to the DVD, a videotaped segment that shows him introducing the documentary on stage at its premiere. For 45 minutes, he discusses with candor and a sense of humor, the historical context of the events that take place in the film as well as their impact on him. Highly recommended as a fascinating record of a most unusual presidency.",4,The Importance of Being Bill...a Lesson in Political Survival,1098748800,"10 26, 2004",2004,3289,"['Overlooked', 'plethora', 'anti-Bush', 'DVDs', 'currently', 'market', 'election', 'documentary', 'intriguing', 'look', 'purported', 'plot', 'destroy', 'career', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'what', 'Hillary', 'claimed', 'was', 'vast', 'right-wing', 'conspiracy', 'Given', 'was', 'co-directed', 'famous', 'Friend', 'Bill', 'Harry', 'Thomason', 'Nickolas', 'Perry', 'one', 'can', 'hardly', 'expect', 'completely', 'impartial', 'view', 'subject', 'Consequently', 'unlikely', 'change', 'minds', 'staunch', 'Republicans', 'there', 'already', 'critical', 'Clinton', 'presidency', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'provide', 'important', 'context', 'lot', 'more', 'unsavory', 'details', 'surrounding', 'case', 'more', 'conservative', 'media', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'result', 'intriguing', 'examination', 'President', 'scrutinized', 'unprecedented', 'film', 'Clinton', 'early', 'days', 'Arkansas', 'state', 'government', 'focus', 'two', 'more', 'damaging', 'episodes', 'political', 'career', 'Whitewater', 'scandal', 'attempted', 'impeachment', 'trial', 'based', 'sexual', 'escapades', 'White', 'House', 'years', 'Many', 'involved', 'scandals', 'are', 'featured', 'here', 'news', 'clips', 'few', 'newly', 'interviewed', 'Surprisingly', 'events', 'do', 'not', 'reflect', 'overly', 'biased', 'perspective', 'thus', 'showing', 'warts-and-all', 'portrait', 'flawed', 'man', 'reconstruction', 'sorts', 'Whether', 'not', 'agree', 'what', 'presented', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'convincing', 'job', 'backing', 'up', 'portrayal', 'less', 'flattering', 'footage', 'Clinton', 'years', 'use', 'dramatic', 're-creations', 'clips', 'variety', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'sometimes', 'undermines', 'film', 'seriousness', 'do', ""n't"", 'minimize', 'points', 'raised', 'higher', 'profile', 'personalities', 'anti-Clinton', 'camp', 'come', 'off', 'poorly', 'according', 'evidence', 'presented', 'justifiably', 'so', 'Paula', 'Jones', 'seen', 'fame-seeking', 'narcissist', 'Kenneth', 'Starr', 'portrayed', 'ruthless', 'opportunist', 'obsessed', 'agenda', 'indifferent', 'damage', 'tactics', 'incur', 'duty', 'serving', 'public', 'trust', 'other', 'side', 'former', 'Clinton', 'advisor', 'James', 'Carville', 'sums', 'up', 'accurately', 'documentary', 'main', 'question', 'i.e.', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'should', 'be', 'spent', 'clearly', 'partisan', 'effort', 'pull', 'virtual', 'coup', 'd', 'eacute', 'tat', 'elected', 'American', 'president', 'Probably', 'most', 'telling', 'moments', 'belong', 'Susan', 'McDougal', 'refusal', 'cooperate', 'Starr', 'Whitewater', 'case', 'led', 'serving', 'two', 'years', 'maximum-security', 'prison', 'prison', 'experiences', 'piercing', 'often', 'horrifying', 'detail.Unfortunately', 'Monica', 'Lewinsky', 'affair', 'given', 'short', 'shrift', 'film', 'sad', 'omission', 'was', 'one', 'development', 'expedited', 'Clinton', 'fall', 'grace', 'Nevertheless', 'film', 'also', 'amazing', 'resilience', 'rising', 'political', 'fray', 'fact', 'Clinton', 'clear', 'evidence', 'interesting', 'supplement', 'DVD', 'videotaped', 'segment', 'introducing', 'documentary', 'stage', 'premiere', '45', 'minutes', 'candor', 'sense', 'humor', 'historical', 'context', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'impact', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'fascinating', 'record', 'most', 'unusual', 'presidency']",N/A

Pauzer,"[2, 3]","If you are looking for an uplifting story of the human condition and character, this may put you into a depression, as it describes how both can sink far below the crush depth of common decency. This story describes the abyss of vindictiveness, meaness, chicanery, and manipulation.  It is a reminder that politics is not just mean or ugly, but brutal, and it can be brutal even when the stakes are inconsequential and petty.So it was in Arkansas, when Larry Case, a private investigator attempted to gain anything on Governor Bill Clinton to be used against him. Larry Nichols, an employee fired by the governor, wanted it to get even.  Larry Case didn't care if what he found was real or phony, but he did find a jingle singer, Jennifer Flowers who could embarrass the governor. Two piqued Arkansas State Troopers decided to give up the governor's dalliances after he failed to deliver on jobs he promised them after his presidential election.  Another flower would come out of the woodwork to claim a sexual harassment suit against the President. Her name is Paula Jones.  With an IQ resembling a bra size, she is egged on by three attorneys who are working on this unbeknownst to their law firms.  The elves, as they are called, Ann Coulter, George Connery, and Jerome Marcus, persuade Jones that a settlement of $700,000 is not enough without an apology, and the Supreme Court, for the first time, gives the okay to depose a sitting President of the United States in a civil matter. She gets rid of kinder, gentler attorneys, Gill Davis and Joe Canumarata.  The trap is set to get Bill Clinton under oath where he might make a false statement that can then be turned into a criminal matter. That would involve high crimes and misdemeanors and impeachment. For the first time in our history, impeachment is used not to punish wrongdoing, but as a politcal weapon.In the meantime, the Rutherford Institute and Jerry Falwell, a man of the cloth is also a man of the Holy DVD. He promotes scripture in the form of ""Citizens for Honest Government,"" which accuses Clinton of being a drug smuggler, embezzler and murderer. It is narrated by--Larry Nichols. (In Jesus' name, we pray)!This story goes into a second part, called the Arkansas Project which is engineered by archconservative, Richard Mellon Scaife, who bankrolls a full-time, all-out smear campaign against the Clintons. This is Whitewater.  It will involve David Hale, a lawyer, judge, and sleaze lending-meister who is indicted in September 1993 and is sentenced to 28 months in jail.  Willing to do anything to get less time, he claims that his shady dealmaking involved Bill Clinton.  A former Reagan appointee, Ed Olsen unsuccessfully attempts to tie the Clintons to Hale's illegal mischief.  Robert Fisk is appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the Clinton's financial past. He is not only the President of the American Bar Association, but is one of the most respected attorneys in the country.  When it looks like Fisk is going to exonerate the Clintons of any wrongdoing, he is replaced by Ken Starr a Republican hack appointed by a three-judge panel of Jesse Helms appointees. (Helms hates Clinton from his viscera). Ken Starr is also a former Solicitor General who lost his job, thanks to--Bill Clinton.  Starr will go after failed banker Jim McDougall who is willing to make any kind of deal to stay out of jail.  He is willing to say that the Clintons were involved in shady loan receiving.  There is only one problem. His wife, Susan is unwilling to go along.  The independent investigators make it clear that she will go to jail unless she gives them a ""proffer"" against Bill Clinton.  She refuses.  Not only does she end up in jail, but she is given a red jumpsuit to wear, which indicates that she is a child killer.  This puts her near the bottom of the inmate food chain.  She will also be accused of being Bill Clinton's lover.William Jefferson Clinton will be charged with two counts of high crimes and misdemeanors.  He will be tried and found not guilty by the Senate, thus infuriating even more those who were out to get him.The so-called liberal press are sent to Little Rock, to be taken in by hayseed locals, known for lies and scams, who provide monumental exaggerations about Clinton.  Those that investigate their information and find it questionable are told by their editors to come back with something on the Clintons.  The news that Bill Clinton had nothing to do with Whitewater, receives barely a mention in the media.With Morgan Freeman's superb narration, and a story so, literally unfathomable, you cannot help watching this with a morbid curiosity for not just how it could happen, but the depths to what people will do for slights real or imagined, or because they just didn't like someone's political party or election.  It revealed how stunning politics can be for things so devoid of issues, ideology, or justice.  It is not hard to see Susan McDougall as a forerunner of Jose Padilla. Having already thought Ann Coulter was one of the most miserable excuses for a human being and a possible sociopath, I was surprised that I still had room to lower her even more, as well as Ken Starr.  I am now convinced that both are certifiable sociopaths.This is the kind of story you watch, and almost hold your breath until it is over. I strongly recommend you see this after the Christmas season.In the meantime, peace on earth and goodwill to all men.Follow-up:Paula Jones ends up with just $200,000 and her husband divorces her.  She sports a nosejob and debases herself by posing nude in Penthouse and going on Fox's Celebrity Boxing where former Olympic iceskater, Tanya Harding cleans her clock. She will complain on a TV talk show that she was used by Clinton and the Republicans while ""Ann Coulter's done books.""Jim McDougall dies in prison.A number of Republican politicians appointed to investigate Clinton's affairs will discover that female skeletons will be found in their own closets of infidelity.Unable to prove anything after an investigation that costs the government approximately $40,000,000, Senator Alfonse D'Amato (R-NY) announces that even though there was not one indictment, that ""something stinks.""Ken Starr says that he is willing to talk things over with Susan McDougall, over lunch.

836159,A140XH16IKR4B0,B0002IQK9U,Jean E. Pouliot,"[0, 0]","Elected in 1992, Bill Clinton was a target of the right from the moment the news of his election was announced. ""The Hunting of the President"" describes a smear attack on Clinton by a gaggle of an unlikely Arkansas lowlife characters that ballooned into Ken Starr's $50 million ""investigation"" that led to Clinton's impeachment.What is so stunning about the film is that Clinton was nearly done in by some of the lamest and strangest folks in the land. To see Paula Jones absolutely exulting in the attention she was receiving says a lot about the motivation behind her charges. Interviews with many of the principal actors - Paul Begala, James Carville, Susan McDougall, Jerry Falwell and others -- brings a level of depth that the media of the time didn't come near. In fact, that the media allow this lame circus to continue --and that our elected representatives piled on without constitutional backing to bring down a duly elected US President -- is dispiriting and enraging. Serious journalists who investigated  the charges on their own knew there was no wrongdoing involved in Whitewater, Troopergate and all the other ""gates"" that became the hallmark of the Clinton administration. But the public, convinced of Clinton's weaknesses, ate up every whisper and innuendo fed to it by a self-interested media, and lost its collective mind -- unaware and evidently uncaring that ensnaring a President in an ongoing soap opera might not be in the public interest.I disagree with other reviewers who loved the extra showing Bill Clinton speaking for 43 minutes after the film's premiere showing. Good Lord, the man could drone on! But frankly, I don't care that he portrays himself as a hapless victim of his political enemies, and I pin some of this mess on him. Clinton's sin was less his indiscretion with ""that woman, Miss Lewinsky,"" than in his inability to shut down the small time, small-minded super-partisan attacks that paralyzed the nation. ""The Hunting of the President"" showed me how insignificant and easily deflected was Clinton's opposition. Between the troopers' self-interested pique and Ken Starr's partisan sanctimony, there were many, many stories the media and public could have followed. A weakness of the film is that it doesn't delve much into the context that allowed the lunatic right to define the story. It would have been helpful, for instance, to describe how the expansion of the cable news channels allowed more and more beautiful-yet-brainless journalists keep the 24-hour news spotlight focused on Clinton's supposed ""corruption.""Though ""The Hunting of the President"" made me want to read the book, the images of the participants was priceless. Watching serial-liar Jerry Falwell unctuously distance himself from the notorious ""Clinton Chronicles"" -- a mendacity-packed video promoted and disseminated by his own Moral Majority -- because he never *personally* claimed that Clinton was a drug-dealer and murderer is to see where the true corruption of the Clinton era lay, and was worth the price of the film.

How can the film documentary version be such a failure?It's a complex narative that doesn't really lend itself to a nicely packaged video format. There's an entire section of the film that deals with the media's pack mentality. That mentality exists due to the need to tell a story within a 2:00 minute TV segment or 30 column inches. There is far too much meat in this topic (almost 9 years of history) to boil it down in just over 90 minutes.The editing is amature at best. Why do we see a still photo of an Arkansas Clinton antagonist no fewer than 7 times, occasionally when his actual role in the hunting is not the topic? Why, whenever the FBI investigation in Arkansas is discussed, are we shown old '40s g-men movie footage? (Sure, the FBI helped in a witch hunt and the resources would have been better spent tracking Mohamad Atta, but does the footage imply that the entire bureau are &quot;jack booted thugs?&quot;)Eventually, the persuasiveness of the topic is lost among the utter stupidity of the video editorial choices.A warning for political operatives with powerful books.

Although the film starts by indicating that it is based on the book, this is only very loosely true.  A great deal contained in the book is left out in the film, and the film contains a surprising amount of content that is not in the book.  In the end, they complement one another marvelously.The film begins with a shot of the United States Capitol with former Senator Dale Bumpers memorably defending Pres. Clinton during his impeachment trial.  When he asks how it was that the president was being impeached for lying about what was merely a private wrongdoing the film cuts back to the earliest days of the Clinton administration, and goes through the various trumped up and absurd charges made against Clinton during the nineties, from Whitewater to the ridiculous charge of the murder of Vince Foster to Troopergate to the allegations of Paula Jones (which not even her lawyers believed).  Like the book, the movie excells because it shows in great detail the lack of concern with truth that the Right displayed throughout all of this, and the extraorinarily organized and partisan nature of all the opposition to Clinton.As an Arkansan, I especially appreciated the way in which the film explains the various Arkansas characters involved in the story.  As a former student of Ouachita Baptist University, I knew Bob Riley (one of the finest and most fascinating individuals in Arkansas history, as highly decorated war hero, professor, and politician), whose widow is interviewed extensively in the film.  I did not know Jim McDougal.  His wife, Susan, emerges in the film as one of the great symbols of the affair, as she is crushed by Kenneth Starr's inhuman prosecution machine because she refuses to lie about either Bill Clinton or Hillary.  Her dedication to truth is so great that she goes to prison (where she is housed with child murderers instead of the general prison population, by Starr's orders) rather than lie.  She emerges as one of the few heroes in the tawdry persecution of Clinton, and one of the most innocent victims.Like the book, this documentary is essential viewing for anyone wanting the understand the Clinton years.  It is also a cautionary tale, because the Right wing machine that mindlessly and irrationally attack a moderate Democratic president in 1993 will unquestionably do the same with a new Democratic president in 2005.

Since we live in a democracy, the idea that somebody (particularly the president and First Lady) could be hunted outside the bounds of the law was admittedly difficult to handle.It is important to remember that difficult is not the same thing as impossible however. Where there was a will, there was a way to track and attempt trapping the Clintons.From the 1970's, many well organized and well funded people on the far right have sought to stop the Clintons specifically because they represent the triumph of the 'counterculture' over the political status quo.The 1992 campaign results (where Clinton defeated the elder Bush) had only intensified their efforts to slander Bill Clinton. Even Bill's moderate politics were too much for these people who still remembered trivia like Bill and Hillary had been among the law school students who helped draft impeachment articles against Richard M. Nixon before his resignation over Watergate.A public who sees them before these hatchet jobs and slander campaigns also discovers that the Clintons had generally tried to do the right thing for the good of this country. Coincidentally, the far right's numerous investigations were interfering with Clinton's ability to govern the country, ironically being aided by the so-called 'liberal' mass media.No matter how ridiculous the allegation, the mass media complied with the `investigation'. By ignoring obviously partisan motives for the numerous investigations and an ever-expanding area of investigation, the media ironically veered away from it's ""Watergate era"" heyday.Based on Joe Conason and Gene Lyon's book (2001), this film is definitely a political thriller. In order to overcome the sham investigation and impeachment proceedings which dogged the administration, both Clintons had to stay one step ahead of their persecutors at all times.The question is: Can they beat the clock?",5,Hillary was right,1109203200,"02 24, 2005",2005,2092,"['claiming', ""'vast"", 'right', 'wing', 'conspiracy', 'was', 'attacking', 'president', 'Hillary', 'Clinton', 'became', 'vilified', 'media', 'making', 'up', ""'wild"", 'stories', 'only', 'presumably', 'draw', 'attention', 'live', 'democracy', 'idea', 'somebody', 'particularly', 'president', 'First', 'Lady', 'could', 'be', 'hunted', 'bounds', 'law', 'was', 'admittedly', 'difficult', 'handle.It', 'important', 'remember', 'difficult', 'not', 'same', 'thing', 'impossible', 'however', 'Where', 'was', 'will', 'was', 'way', 'track', 'attempt', 'trapping', 'Clintons.From', '1970', 'many', 'well', 'organized', 'well', 'funded', 'people', 'far', 'right', 'have', 'sought', 'stop', 'Clintons', 'specifically', 'represent', 'triumph', ""'counterculture"", 'political', 'status', 'quo.The', '1992', 'campaign', 'results', 'where', 'Clinton', 'defeated', 'elder', 'Bush', 'had', 'only', 'intensified', 'efforts', 'slander', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'Even', 'Bill', 'moderate', 'politics', 'were', 'too', 'much', 'people', 'who', 'still', 'remembered', 'trivia', 'Bill', 'Hillary', 'had', 'been', 'law', 'school', 'students', 'who', 'helped', 'draft', 'impeachment', 'articles', 'Richard', 'M.', 'Nixon', 'resignation', 'Watergate.A', 'public', 'who', 'hatchet', 'jobs', 'slander', 'campaigns', 'also', 'Clintons', 'had', 'generally', 'tried', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'good', 'country', 'Coincidentally', 'far', 'right', 'numerous', 'investigations', 'were', 'interfering', 'Clinton', 'ability', 'govern', 'country', 'ironically', 'being', 'aided', 'so-called', ""'liberal"", 'mass', 'media.No', 'matter', 'how', 'ridiculous', 'allegation', 'mass', 'media', 'complied', 'investigation', 'ignoring', 'obviously', 'partisan', 'motives', 'numerous', 'investigations', 'ever-expanding', 'area', 'investigation', 'media', 'ironically', 'veered', 'away', 'Watergate', 'era', 'heyday.Based', 'Joe', 'Conason', 'Gene', 'Lyon', 'book', '2001', 'film', 'definitely', 'political', 'thriller', 'order', 'overcome', 'sham', 'investigation', 'impeachment', 'proceedings', 'dogged', 'administration', 'Clintons', 'had', 'stay', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'persecutors', 'times.The', 'question', 'Can', 'beat', 'clock']",N/A

The reason I cannot give this film five stars is that a film is NEVER as good as the book. If nothing else, there are no footnotes, and critics can easily say that much in the film is false.That aside, I was pretty impressed with this (though recommend the book for those who have the time to read it. It's available from Amazon.com--read it!) As indicated in the book, the hunt for Bill and Hillary Clinton started before Bill decided to run for president. There were PIs and others of dubious merit trying to pry a buck or two out of allegations of Clinton's sexual indiscretions. They came up with Paula Jones. Then Falwell released a film suggesting Clinton's collaboration in everything short of the Kennedy Assassination and the Reichstag fire. From there, downhill, if you can believe it.Ken Starr's blatantly partisan motives were so transparent from the beginning; the name Richard Mellon Scaife, who funds many of the right wing ""movements"" came up, like it did in the book, several times.Then there was Whitewater. Starr brought down the house on an ill-advised real estate deal in which Clintons lost money and broke no laws--as even Starr had to concede. In the meantime, they found a young woman by the name of Monica.As I indicated some time ago in my review of the book, I wonder what Clinton may have been able to accomplish had he not been hunted down ruthlessly through his term. And I still think Starr and his associates should be tried for an insidious sedition, trying to disrupt the work of an elected government when the only questionable activity he could find after a couple hundred million tax-paid dollars worth of harrassment was a minor sexual  offense. And that was NOT a threat to national security.One of the film's hilights was the case against Susan McDougal. In their pursuit of something to hang Clinton for, the Starr bunch offered her a deal to free herself of potential jail time, a ""proffer"" as the screen defined. Her husband had lost everything in the Whitewater deal, dreaded the prospect of dying in prison, and encouraged her to take the deal. She refused and spent a couple of years in prison. (For that alone, the prosecutors should be disbarred and imprisoned for a long, long time!) She's a real heroine to me; she could have taken the easier way out. But, as one of her lawyers advised her, ""Susan, if you lie now, you'll be lying for the rest of your life."" Like those who jailed her...There was a fair amount of honesty in the film too, by the way. Many of Clinton's aides indicated how furious they were with him for that sexual activity.Another highlight of the film is that the ""mainstream"" media fueled the investigation! Some interviewed during the film said they'd go to their editors after the reporter had nothing to report. The editors accused them of being Clintonphiles and dismissed the nothing they found! So much for the ""left wing"" media of which the right incessantly pouts.As to film structure, I have one concrete criticism: The director tried to pull a Michael Moore. He slipped in ostensibly comical  clips from old films relevant to what was going on in the narrative. But, frankly, Moore is much more talented at that, at the choice of clips and the timing. In fact, in this film, they were a little distracting, and I regret that.Oh, and this is one film in which it's important to pay attention to the credits at the end. Among those listed are the many ""mainstream"" reporters who wouldn't be interviewed for the film. One name, from a prominent news weekly, stands out to me because of his comments on a recent Michael Moore film. Critics of THAT critic have accused him of being an apologist for anything Reagan or the Bushes have ever done. Interesting that he refused to be interviewed for this film. And there were several others.An additional highlight of this film is a speech by Clinton after  the film's release. As usual, he didn't free himself from responsbility for the activity with Monica. On the contrary, he admitted to it. And he acknowledged that what the prosecutors had done to McDougal was ""abuse of power,"" something for which new laws must be devised to eliminate! He was more confident than I, frankly, in his appraisal that things DO get better despite right wing slander campaigns, and he gave a number of historical examples.Overall I recommend the film despite its weaknesses. Many don't read, or don't have the time to do so. This will at least open the door to some questions we all should have on the events of the last decade and more.And, again, my kudos to Susan McDougal. May we all exercise such integrity.",4,Needs to be seen,1102636800,"12 10, 2004",2004,4684,"['DVD', 'based', 'ultimately', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'reason', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'film', 'NEVER', 'as', 'good', 'book', 'nothing', 'else', 'are', 'footnotes', 'critics', 'can', 'easily', 'say', 'much', 'film', 'false.That', 'aside', 'was', 'pretty', 'impressed', 'recommend', 'book', 'who', 'have', 'time', 'read', 'available', 'Amazon.com', 'read', 'indicated', 'book', 'hunt', 'Bill', 'Hillary', 'Clinton', 'started', 'Bill', 'decided', 'run', 'president', 'were', 'PIs', 'others', 'dubious', 'merit', 'trying', 'pry', 'buck', 'two', 'allegations', 'Clinton', 'sexual', 'indiscretions', 'came', 'up', 'Paula', 'Jones', 'Then', 'Falwell', 'released', 'film', 'suggesting', 'Clinton', 'collaboration', 'everything', 'short', 'Kennedy', 'Assassination', 'Reichstag', 'fire', 'there', 'downhill', 'can', 'believe', 'it.Ken', 'Starr', 'blatantly', 'partisan', 'motives', 'were', 'so', 'transparent', 'beginning', 'name', 'Richard', 'Mellon', 'Scaife', 'who', 'funds', 'many', 'right', 'wing', 'movements', 'came', 'up', 'did', 'book', 'several', 'times.Then', 'was', 'Whitewater', 'Starr', 'brought', 'down', 'house', 'ill-advised', 'real', 'estate', 'deal', 'Clintons', 'lost', 'money', 'broke', 'laws', 'even', 'Starr', 'had', 'concede', 'meantime', 'found', 'young', 'woman', 'name', 'Monica.As', 'indicated', 'time', 'ago', 'review', 'book', 'wonder', 'what', 'Clinton', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'accomplish', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'hunted', 'down', 'ruthlessly', 'term', 'still', 'think', 'Starr', 'associates', 'should', 'be', 'tried', 'insidious', 'sedition', 'trying', 'disrupt', 'work', 'elected', 'government', 'when', 'only', 'questionable', 'activity', 'could', 'find', 'couple', 'hundred', 'million', 'tax-paid', 'dollars', 'harrassment', 'was', 'minor', 'sexual', 'offense', 'was', 'NOT', 'threat', 'national', 'security.One', 'film', 'hilights', 'was', 'case', 'Susan', 'McDougal', 'pursuit', 'something', 'hang', 'Clinton', 'Starr', 'bunch', 'offered', 'deal', 'free', 'herself', 'potential', 'jail', 'time', 'proffer', 'screen', 'defined', 'husband', 'had', 'lost', 'everything', 'Whitewater', 'deal', 'dreaded', 'prospect', 'dying', 'prison', 'encouraged', 'take', 'deal', 'refused', 'spent', 'couple', 'years', 'prison', 'alone', 'prosecutors', 'should', 'be', 'disbarred', 'imprisoned', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'real', 'heroine', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'easier', 'way', 'one', 'lawyers', 'advised', 'Susan', 'lie', 'now', ""'ll"", 'be', 'lying', 'rest', 'life', 'who', 'jailed', 'was', 'fair', 'amount', 'honesty', 'film', 'too', 'way', 'Many', 'Clinton', 'aides', 'indicated', 'how', 'furious', 'were', 'sexual', 'activity.Another', 'highlight', 'film', 'mainstream', 'media', 'fueled', 'investigation', 'interviewed', 'film', 'said', ""'d"", 'go', 'editors', 'reporter', 'had', 'nothing', 'report', 'editors', 'accused', 'being', 'Clintonphiles', 'dismissed', 'nothing', 'found', 'So', 'much', 'left', 'wing', 'media', 'right', 'incessantly', 'film', 'structure', 'have', 'one', 'concrete', 'criticism', 'director', 'tried', 'pull', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'slipped', 'ostensibly', 'comical', 'clips', 'old', 'films', 'relevant', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'narrative', 'frankly', 'Moore', 'much', 'more', 'talented', 'choice', 'clips', 'timing', 'fact', 'film', 'were', 'little', 'distracting', 'regret', 'that.Oh', 'one', 'film', 'important', 'pay', 'attention', 'credits', 'end', 'listed', 'are', 'many', 'mainstream', 'reporters', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'interviewed', 'film', 'One', 'name', 'prominent', 'news', 'weekly', 'out', 'comments', 'recent', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'film', 'Critics', 'THAT', 'critic', 'have', 'accused', 'being', 'apologist', 'anything', 'Reagan', 'Bushes', 'have', 'ever', 'done', 'Interesting', 'refused', 'be', 'interviewed', 'film', 'were', 'several', 'others.An', 'additional', 'highlight', 'film', 'speech', 'Clinton', 'film', 'release', 'usual', 'did', ""n't"", 'free', 'responsbility', 'activity', 'Monica', 'contrary', 'admitted', 'acknowledged', 'what', 'prosecutors', 'had', 'done', 'McDougal', 'was', 'abuse', 'power', 'something', 'new', 'laws', 'must', 'be', 'devised', 'eliminate', 'was', 'more', 'confident', 'frankly', 'appraisal', 'things', 'DO', 'get', 'better', 'right', 'wing', 'slander', 'campaigns', 'gave', 'number', 'historical', 'examples.Overall', 'recommend', 'film', 'weaknesses', 'Many', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'do', 'so', 'will', 'least', 'open', 'door', 'questions', 'should', 'have', 'events', 'last', 'decade', 'more.And', 'again', 'kudos', 'Susan', 'McDougal', 'May', 'exercise', 'such', 'integrity']",N/A
836171,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,B0002IQK9U,William Hare,"[28, 32]","Based on the New York Times bestseller of the same name by Gene Lyons and Joe Conason, ""The Hunting of the President"" is an explosive DVD telling the incredible story of how a coup d'etat by highly financed right wing operatives launched against a popular American president almost succeeded.Reclusive Pittsburgh billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife, whose $1 million donation to President Richard Nixon and Vice President Spiro Agnew was the largest of the 1972 campaign, combines a natural propensity for Republican candidates with rightist agendas alongside a seething hatred for Bill Clinton that knows no bounds.As noted in this documentary, Clinton, a governor from the small southern state of Arkansas, was considered an outsider by Washington power brokers.  Many for this reason resented him.  A second reason for the burning resentment against Clinton was breaking what Republican activists believed was a stranglehold on the presidency as the party won all but one election, the sole Democratic exception being President Jimmy Carter, between Nixon's first victory in 1968 and that of George Herbert Walker Bush in 1988.Money was no object to Scaife and his motivation was strong to get Clinton.  Money was spent in droves in Arkansas as a band of junior college dropout country boys used the opportunity to outslicker invading reporters from the big cities lying northward.  They were supplied with great motivation as the money poured in and the talk flowed.  Scaife was able to get things rolling in The American Spectator, the right wing publication he bankrolled, while Reverend Moon's Washington Times also generated support.All it took was some publicity whipped up in right wing journalistic circles and the city slickers in the designer suits wearing Guccis descended on Arkansas with word processors in hand.  As Democratic Party consultant Paul Begala said, ""I used to watch the Andy Griffith Show and noticed the way that city slickers would come into Mayberry and get taken by country folk.  This is what happened in Arkansas.""The stories were told and the well-financed effort gathered enough momentum to generate attention in mainstream publications such as the New York Times and Washington Post.  It then became a question of time before a major effort was undertaken to remove the president the right wing ideologues loathed.After the creation of the Special Counsel's Office headed by staunch Republican attorney and former judge, Kenneth Starr, moved into action, created through major impetus from controversial right wing Senator Jesse Helms from North Carolina, it was full speed ahead.  When the Whitewater land investigation and alleged harassment against former Arkansas government employee Paula Jones failed to generate the necessary impetus to move toward an impeachment action, the ultimate lightning struck.The lightning came in the form of a brief White House affair between Clinton and a young White House intern from California named Monica Lewinsky.  The $80 million effort of the Starr Committee spun toward a new success as the House of Representatives ultimately impeached Clinton before he was acquitted in a trial before the United States Senate.Washington personalities such as Paul Begala, Dan Moldea, James Carville and Sidney Blumenthal decry the expensive vindictiveness of the Scaife movement and how it diverted the country from serious business such as the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.  The taxpayers bore an ultimate bill of $80 million for a right wing coup attempt, which came perilously close to succeeding.  There was no figure available on how much the bloodthirsty Richard Mellon Scaife spent in the blindly partisan endeavor.In arguing on Clinton's behalf in the Senate trial, Senator Dale Bumpers of Arkansas soberly revealed that an extramarital affair compounded with lying about it in an affidavit in a civil action hardly constituted an impeachable offense.  His source was Alexander Hamilton in Federalist Paper 65, not Ann Coulter.",5,An Expensive Coup d'Etat Attempt,1098403200,"10 22, 2004",2004,4006,"['Based', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'bestseller', 'same', 'name', 'Gene', 'Lyons', 'Joe', 'Conason', 'Hunting', 'President', 'explosive', 'DVD', 'telling', 'incredible', 'story', 'how', 'coup', ""d'etat"", 'highly', 'financed', 'right', 'wing', 'operatives', 'launched', 'popular', 'American', 'president', 'almost', 'succeeded.Reclusive', 'Pittsburgh', 'billionaire', 'Richard', 'Mellon', 'Scaife', '1', 'million', 'donation', 'President', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'Vice', 'President', 'Spiro', 'Agnew', 'was', 'largest', '1972', 'campaign', 'natural', 'propensity', 'Republican', 'candidates', 'rightist', 'agendas', 'seething', 'hatred', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'bounds.As', 'noted', 'documentary', 'Clinton', 'governor', 'small', 'southern', 'state', 'Arkansas', 'was', 'considered', 'outsider', 'Washington', 'power', 'brokers', 'Many', 'reason', 'resented', 'second', 'reason', 'burning', 'resentment', 'Clinton', 'was', 'breaking', 'what', 'Republican', 'activists', 'believed', 'was', 'stranglehold', 'presidency', 'party', 'won', 'one', 'election', 'sole', 'Democratic', 'exception', 'being', 'President', 'Jimmy', 'Carter', 'Nixon', 'first', 'victory', '1968', 'George', 'Herbert', 'Walker', 'Bush', '1988.Money', 'was', 'object', 'Scaife', 'motivation', 'was', 'strong', 'get', 'Clinton', 'Money', 'was', 'spent', 'droves', 'Arkansas', 'band', 'junior', 'college', 'country', 'boys', 'used', 'opportunity', 'outslicker', 'invading', 'reporters', 'big', 'cities', 'lying', 'northward', 'were', 'supplied', 'great', 'motivation', 'money', 'poured', 'talk', 'flowed', 'Scaife', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'things', 'rolling', 'American', 'Spectator', 'right', 'wing', 'publication', 'bankrolled', 'Reverend', 'Moon', 'Washington', 'Times', 'also', 'generated', 'support.All', 'took', 'was', 'publicity', 'whipped', 'up', 'right', 'wing', 'journalistic', 'circles', 'city', 'slickers', 'designer', 'suits', 'wearing', 'Guccis', 'descended', 'Arkansas', 'word', 'processors', 'hand', 'Democratic', 'Party', 'consultant', 'Paul', 'Begala', 'said', 'used', 'watch', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Show', 'noticed', 'way', 'city', 'slickers', 'would', 'come', 'Mayberry', 'get', 'taken', 'country', 'folk', 'what', 'happened', 'Arkansas', 'stories', 'were', 'told', 'well-financed', 'effort', 'gathered', 'enough', 'momentum', 'generate', 'attention', 'mainstream', 'publications', 'such', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'Washington', 'Post', 'then', 'became', 'question', 'time', 'major', 'effort', 'was', 'undertaken', 'remove', 'president', 'right', 'wing', 'ideologues', 'loathed.After', 'creation', 'Special', 'Counsel', 'Office', 'headed', 'staunch', 'Republican', 'attorney', 'former', 'judge', 'Kenneth', 'Starr', 'moved', 'action', 'created', 'major', 'impetus', 'controversial', 'right', 'wing', 'Senator', 'Jesse', 'Helms', 'North', 'Carolina', 'was', 'full', 'speed', 'ahead', 'When', 'Whitewater', 'land', 'investigation', 'alleged', 'harassment', 'former', 'Arkansas', 'government', 'employee', 'Paula', 'Jones', 'failed', 'generate', 'necessary', 'impetus', 'move', 'impeachment', 'action', 'ultimate', 'lightning', 'struck.The', 'lightning', 'came', 'form', 'brief', 'White', 'House', 'affair', 'Clinton', 'young', 'White', 'House', 'intern', 'California', 'named', 'Monica', 'Lewinsky', '80', 'million', 'effort', 'Starr', 'Committee', 'new', 'success', 'House', 'Representatives', 'ultimately', 'impeached', 'Clinton', 'was', 'acquitted', 'trial', 'United', 'States', 'Senate.Washington', 'personalities', 'such', 'Paul', 'Begala', 'Dan', 'Moldea', 'James', 'Carville', 'Sidney', 'Blumenthal', 'decry', 'expensive', 'vindictiveness', 'Scaife', 'movement', 'how', 'diverted', 'country', 'serious', 'business', 'such', 'crisis', 'former', 'Yugoslavia', 'taxpayers', 'bore', 'ultimate', 'bill', '80', 'million', 'right', 'wing', 'coup', 'attempt', 'came', 'perilously', 'close', 'succeeding', 'was', 'figure', 'available', 'how', 'much', 'bloodthirsty', 'Richard', 'Mellon', 'Scaife', 'spent', 'blindly', 'partisan', 'endeavor.In', 'arguing', 'Clinton', 'behalf', 'Senate', 'trial', 'Senator', 'Dale', 'Bumpers', 'Arkansas', 'soberly', 'revealed', 'extramarital', 'affair', 'compounded', 'lying', 'affidavit', 'civil', 'action', 'hardly', 'constituted', 'impeachable', 'offense', 'source', 'was', 'Alexander', 'Hamilton', 'Federalist', 'Paper', '65', 'not', 'Ann', 'Coulter']",N/A
