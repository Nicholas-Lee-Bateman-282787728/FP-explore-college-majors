1072801,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B000PQZYC8,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[3, 3]","Kinamand is a subtle romance that begins with a pro forma marriage, in other words, arranged to deceive the immigration department.  Expect a slow-paced love story with subtle humor.The Danish film  (2005)  Kinamand which means (Chinaman) begins with a 25 year marriage dissolving to the point where the wife leaves.  Keld is a boring husband, quiet, reserved man, and also a plumber.  When his wife decides to leave, the plumbing blusiness is neglected, he sold much of the furniture and he appears lonely and lost.  He begins to eat at the local Chinese grill every evening, ordering the meals by the number.  Slowly he gets to know Feng, the owner and his family.When a plumbing problem occurs at the restaurant, Feng propositions Keld to work on the plumbing in exchange for meals.  Then Feng has another proposition, for Keld to marry his sister for benefit of immigration. With the marriage, comes an attempt at communicating with one another, understanding the cultural differences to a very subtle romance.The film does not rely on a lot of action, but more on images, facial expressions, body language.  The subtitles are clear to read, and I like that they are white letters with a black background.  You will hear nice Chinese music intermittently throughout the film as it defines the Chinese culture in other country, Denmark.Bjarne Henriksen who plays the role of Keld is convincing in his role; he seems a very reserved man, who suddenly is thrust into the unknown.  The character of his son plays the antagonist role very well.  There is sadness and humor.  This is my first film with director  Henrik Ruben Genz, whose film Terribly Happy, (2009) a black comedy, thriller has garnered some attention; it seems a departure from Kinamand......Rizzo",5,Something sweet in Denmark,1268524800,"03 14, 2010",2010,1763,"['Kinamand', 'subtle', 'romance', 'pro', 'forma', 'marriage', 'other', 'words', 'arranged', 'deceive', 'immigration', 'department', 'Expect', 'slow-paced', 'love', 'story', 'subtle', 'humor.The', 'Danish', 'film', '2005', 'Kinamand', 'Chinaman', '25', 'year', 'marriage', 'dissolving', 'point', 'where', 'wife', 'Keld', 'boring', 'husband', 'quiet', 'reserved', 'man', 'also', 'plumber', 'When', 'wife', 'leave', 'plumbing', 'blusiness', 'neglected', 'sold', 'much', 'furniture', 'lonely', 'lost', 'eat', 'local', 'Chinese', 'grill', 'evening', 'ordering', 'meals', 'number', 'Slowly', 'know', 'Feng', 'owner', 'family.When', 'plumbing', 'problem', 'restaurant', 'Feng', 'propositions', 'Keld', 'work', 'plumbing', 'exchange', 'meals', 'Then', 'Feng', 'proposition', 'Keld', 'marry', 'sister', 'benefit', 'immigration', 'marriage', 'attempt', 'communicating', 'one', 'understanding', 'cultural', 'differences', 'very', 'subtle', 'romance.The', 'film', 'not', 'rely', 'lot', 'action', 'more', 'images', 'facial', 'expressions', 'body', 'language', 'subtitles', 'are', 'clear', 'read', 'like', 'are', 'white', 'letters', 'black', 'background', 'will', 'hear', 'nice', 'Chinese', 'music', 'intermittently', 'film', 'Chinese', 'culture', 'other', 'country', 'Denmark.Bjarne', 'Henriksen', 'who', 'role', 'Keld', 'convincing', 'role', 'very', 'reserved', 'man', 'who', 'suddenly', 'thrust', 'unknown', 'character', 'son', 'antagonist', 'role', 'very', 'well', 'sadness', 'humor', 'first', 'film', 'director', 'Henrik', 'Ruben', 'Genz', 'film', 'Terribly', 'Happy', '2009', 'black', 'comedy', 'thriller', 'garnered', 'attention', 'departure', 'Kinamand', 'Rizzo']",Chinaman [Region 2]

His wife leaves him to start a new life but not before telling him that life with him was being in a funeral. Alone, he starts frequenting a Chinese restaurant and befriends the owner Feng (Lin Ku Wu) when there is a plumbing problem. The Chinese man gives him a offer that for money he should marry his sister Wen (Vivian Wu) so that she can stay in the country and not have to go back to China. Taken aback, he goes to the divorce meeting and his wife demands $8000 as settlement from the divorce. Now Keld who does not have any money considers the offer of the friend and decides to take up on it and ends up marrying again this time to the Chinese girl and thus is christened Kinamand or Chinaman by a fellow patron.This is a simple story of love in the most unexpected places and how simple gestures can change a person and make him fall in love again. I thought the movie was very sensual without any nudity because the camera lingers on Wen whilst she is practicing Tai Chi or preparing food for the newlywed Keld. The relationship between them is shown as initial curiosity but then as growing love.  The scene when the immigration officer comes for a routine check to Kelds apartment for evidence of cohabitation and Kelds face as he reminisces Wen is one of the best scenes in this heartbreaking and romantic movie. Acting is superb form all the cast members especially the lead Bjarne Henriksen as Keld. Direction is first rate especially with such a minimal sparse story line. I absolutely loved.

Danish actor Bjarne Henriksen is the 'Chinaman' in question - its title taken from a dig thrown at his character, Keld, from a fellow patron at the local Chinese restaurant.  Keld has taken to hanging out there for dinner each night after a split from his wife.  Keld is literally working his way though the menu, number by number.  The restaurant's proprietor, Feng, has a funny line about this:  ""Keld, we have a problem.  You've reached Number 22.  There are no more items on the menu.  What are we going to do now?""  They jointly agree to go back and start with #1.Feng is portrayed by Lin Kun Wu, who IMDB tells me ""worked as a bus driver when he was cast for the role of Feng.""  You'd never know the guy had never acted before getting this part.  He's got an engaging, relaxed presence on the screen.  He's a natural.  He got a Best Supporting Actor nomination from Denmark's ""Bodil Festen,"" an influential critics' event.The movie - both its depiction of its Denmark-based Chinese community and in Lin Kun Wu's casting off the streets of Copenhagen - really says a lot about the breadth of the Chinese diaspora.

1072806,AYCJSA9HR7TKO,B000PQZYC8,Kerry Walters,"[0, 0]","This isn't a great film, but it is a very enjoyable one.  The plot is simple.  Keld, a middle-aged, not-so-ambitious plumber, finds himself a single guy after his wife leaves him.  He strikes up an acquaintance with the Chinese owner of a cafe where he regularly eats, who coaxes Keld into marrying his sister Ling so that she can stay in Sweden.  Rather formulaically, what begins as a marriage of convenience blossoms into romance--but with a bittersweet ending.Vivian Wu plays Ling.  She speaks Chinese throughout the film, and so is neither the audience nor Keld understands what she actually says.  But Wu, one of the best Asian actresses going and sadly underused since her starring role in Peter Greenaway's ""Pillow Book,"" wonderfully conveys Ling's meaning through facial expressions and voice intonations.  Bjarne Hendriksen puts in an admirable performance as Keld.  Keld speaks very little in the film--one of the problems of his marriage is that he seemed silently locked inside of himself--so Hendriksen, like Wu, must rely heavily on acting rather than dialogue.  Finally, Lin Kun Wu's portrayal of Feng, the cafe owner, is heartwarming--and all the more remarkable in that Wu, a busdriver, had never acted before this film.Well worth seeing, ""Kinamand"" is pretty sure to make you feel good and make you cry too.

I do hope the movie is made available on a Region 1 DVD soon as I would love to purchase it.The story is simple enough, but the way it plays out engages the viewer, drawing one into the lives of the characters and making one care about what happens to them. Middle-aged Danish plumber Keld [Bjarne Henriksen] faces a personal crisis when his wife of many years leaves him, presumably for another man. She files for divorce, and insists that Keld admit to adultery so that they can have a quick divorce. Keld finds himself a lost soul, and drifts to the Chinese grill across the street for his evening meals. The jovial restaurant owner Feng [Lin Ku Wu] happily helps Keld work his way through the menu options [which include interesting, eyebrow raising dishes such as ""6 with chicken""]. Eventually,a friendship of sorts develops, and Feng asks a favor of Keld, i.e. to marry his younger sister Ling [Vivian Wu of the ""Pillow Book""]so that she can remain in Denmark and get a visa. Initially Keld is reluctant but he eventually agrees when money is offered due to financial obligations he has to fulfill to his ex-wife.The rest of the movie unfolds in an almost poetic manner, complete with classic Chinese ballads playing in the background, the sumptuous array of Chinese dishes prepared by Ling for Keld, even the gentle Tai-Chi movements practised by Ling every morning. The movie's plot may be somewhat predictable, but the actors put so much into their roles that nothing seems artificial here. Bjarne Henriksen's Keld is mellow and understated, a sort of gentle giant who is just the kind of mild-mannered guy a viewer empathises with. The beautiful and elegant Vivian Wu is perfect in her role as the genteel Chinese bride who seems almost ethereal yet very much aware of what is going on. The relationship between these two souls unfolds in a tender and credible manner.Another highlight performance is Lin Ku Wu's role as Feng - his role provides most of the comic element and I was quite surprised to learn he wasn't a veteran actor, he appears so at ease in front of the camera.Lyrical and bittersweet - recommended for fans of relationship and human dramas.",5,A bittersweet love story,1242864000,"05 21, 2009",2009,2328,"['Kinamand', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'available', 'purchase', 'Region', '1', 'DVD', 'was', 'only', 'thanks', 'Netflix', 'was', 'able', 'watch', 'lovely', 'Danish', 'movie', 'do', 'hope', 'movie', 'made', 'available', 'Region', '1', 'DVD', 'soon', 'would', 'love', 'purchase', 'it.The', 'story', 'simple', 'enough', 'way', 'out', 'viewer', 'drawing', 'one', 'lives', 'characters', 'making', 'one', 'care', 'what', 'Middle-aged', 'Danish', 'plumber', 'Keld', '[', 'Bjarne', 'Henriksen', ']', 'personal', 'crisis', 'when', 'wife', 'many', 'years', 'presumably', 'man', 'divorce', 'Keld', 'admit', 'adultery', 'so', 'can', 'have', 'quick', 'divorce', 'Keld', 'lost', 'soul', 'drifts', 'Chinese', 'grill', 'street', 'evening', 'meals', 'jovial', 'restaurant', 'owner', 'Feng', '[', 'Lin', 'Ku', 'Wu', ']', 'happily', 'Keld', 'work', 'way', 'menu', 'options', '[', 'include', 'interesting', 'eyebrow', 'raising', 'dishes', 'such', '6', 'chicken', ']', 'Eventually', 'friendship', 'sorts', 'develops', 'Feng', 'favor', 'Keld', 'i.e', 'marry', 'younger', 'sister', 'Ling', '[', 'Vivian', 'Wu', 'Pillow', 'Book', ']', 'can', 'remain', 'Denmark', 'get', 'visa', 'Initially', 'Keld', 'reluctant', 'eventually', 'when', 'money', 'offered', 'due', 'financial', 'obligations', 'fulfill', 'ex-wife.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'almost', 'poetic', 'manner', 'complete', 'classic', 'Chinese', 'ballads', 'playing', 'background', 'sumptuous', 'array', 'Chinese', 'dishes', 'prepared', 'Ling', 'Keld', 'even', 'gentle', 'Tai-Chi', 'movements', 'practised', 'Ling', 'morning', 'movie', 'plot', 'may', 'be', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'actors', 'put', 'so', 'much', 'roles', 'nothing', 'artificial', 'here', 'Bjarne', 'Henriksen', 'Keld', 'mellow', 'understated', 'sort', 'gentle', 'giant', 'who', 'just', 'kind', 'mild-mannered', 'guy', 'viewer', 'beautiful', 'elegant', 'Vivian', 'Wu', 'perfect', 'role', 'genteel', 'Chinese', 'bride', 'who', 'almost', 'ethereal', 'yet', 'very', 'much', 'aware', 'what', 'going', 'relationship', 'two', 'souls', 'unfolds', 'tender', 'credible', 'manner.Another', 'highlight', 'performance', 'Lin', 'Ku', 'Wu', 'role', 'Feng', 'role', 'most', 'comic', 'element', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'learn', 'was', ""n't"", 'veteran', 'actor', 'so', 'ease', 'front', 'camera.Lyrical', 'bittersweet', 'recommended', 'fans', 'relationship', 'human', 'dramas']",Chinaman [Region 2]
