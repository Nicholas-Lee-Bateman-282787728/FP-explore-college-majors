I have been a fan of Jeff Dunham for a few years now and have seen his previous DVDs numerious times. All of Jeffs' regulars are here, Walter, Peanut, Achmed and my favorite Jose Jalapeno on a steeeeeek! The usual set up is in place like his previous shows starting with him along on stage with his solo stand up comedy. After that one by one his puppets we all have come to know and love come out for their own particular routine. As is usual with Dunhams' humour it is very politically incorrect which is what makes Jeff so funny. Especially since more of the humour is directed at himself. Having said that I do have to also say while I enjoyed this show it doesn't quite compare to his past shows. The jokes lack a certain something to it and they are a bit too raunchy. I really can't put my finger on it but there is just something missing from Jeffs' performance. The unedited act is not for young children, old people or those easily offended.

But he's a ventriloquist with a wide range of characters that seem almost real and he does some comedy too and has managed to now make several movies and even had his own tv show for awhile.  This is the latest of those movies.Controlled Chaos brings back Jeff's most beloved puppets, Achmed the Dead Terrorist, Jose Jalapeno on a Stick, Peanut, and Walter.  It also features two new puppets, Achmed's son and Little Jeff.  Each has their own personality and Jeff does a skit with one or two of them at a time, interacting with himself, each other, and the audience.  At the beginning, he also does a comedy routine without the puppets as well.As said before, each of the puppets has its own personality.  Walter is a grouchy old man who really isn't afraid of saying anything to anybody.  He likes to lament his marriage and the youth today as well as anything else he happens to think is frivolous.  Achmed is fond of trying to kill people, and claims to harbor a relationship with other terrorists.  In this particular movie he interacts with his son which adds a whole new dimension to him.  Jose Jalapeno uses few words but they always seem to get many laughs.  Being that he is on a stick he doesn't move around much, but he isn't required too, unless someone mentions Mexican food.  Peanut is probably the oddest of Jeff's characters.  I'm not really sure what he is but he looks funny and tends to be real goofy and childlike and loves to get on Jeff's nerves.While this particular movie had its funny moments, I didn't find it near as good as his other movies.  The new characters weren't that compelling and I wish he would have just stuck with his regular four or some of the other side characters he's used in the past.  The jokes sometimes fell flat for all the characters though and there were even a few uncomfortable silences in the mix.  Which is something that is not usual for a Jeff Dunham show.  I felt myself looking at the clock a few times to see when it would be over.  I did appreciate that it was mostly new material, as Jeff has reused material in the past, but it just wasn't the normal Jeff Dunham hilariousness that I'm used to.I'll continue watching Jeff Dunham movie and shows because they are usually uproariously funny, but this one isn't one I'd recommend unless you're a die hard fan.Review by M.

Yes, even though he is rightly thought of as a ventriloquist, it is his great COMEDIC talents that stand out to me.  That is not to minimize his talents as a ventriloquist, as technically he is very, very impressive here too.  Dunham's interactions with his puppets are so complex and realistic that Peanut, Achmed and company really seem to come to life in his hands!  In this show, my 2nd favorite Dunham DVD next to 'Spark of Insanity', he is on a real roll for basically the whole show!  (Any mistakes are redone and edited out, so the whole show flows seamlessly).  His humor is adult, but he is not excessively crude.  Jeff's interactions with the audience are quite amusing.  Dunham's humor would normally be considered offensive, but is not really perceived as such, since it is his dummies who make the offending remarks.  Interesting is how politically incorrect the humor often is, but he gets away with it because it seems like it is the puppets who make the non-PC jokes while Jeff gets 'upset' at them and apologizes for 'their' bad behavior.  Fascinating, as if a regular comedian made some of the same jokes, he/she would likely get booed off the stage, while Jeff's puppets get riotous laughter.
