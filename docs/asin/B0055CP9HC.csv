1442528,A3PDEBNKX9DVF6,B0055CP9HC,"Anthony R. Crain ""Mayor of Oldtown""","[1, 1]","This had all the potential to be great.1. I love norse mythos.2. The vocabulary and grammar style is perfect asgard.3. Loki and Thor are excellent characters.4. An excellent match between music and mood.5. The animation style is bizarre. With a fantastic production, a bizarre style can be incredible. With a bad production, a bizarre animation style is a disaster. There are parts that don't move that should.  There are parts that move more than you would ever expect. There are foreground/background details vs abstract cartoons that are too disparate, and yet, that makes it intriguing.But in the end, the story just bored the crap out of me.Unending dialog and little action. We hear how much Loki hates himself and how much everyone else hates him too. He even makes a great leap saying that everyone else created him, but that he has found a way to beat fate, to be better than the pathetic thing fate wants him to be and that everyone else has helped him to become, even himself.If he was even a little evil, he would have killed every disgusting character that told him how pathetic he was in almost every scene, instead of listening to their words and deciding what they might really mean.The ending was just sad. Was that supposed to be cool or thought provoking? Maybe. I didn't like it at all. I predicted it and it was just sad.Since it is Marvel Knights, I assume this was a comic before it was a show? If so, fans of the comic will likely love the show. But not I.So I give it 3 stars. 1 star for the boring pace and predictable and sad ending. 4 stars for creating this big of an emotional response in me.  Average that out, you get 2.5, so I rounded up.",3,"Sad, Boring, but artistic enough to inspire an emotional response",1346544000,"09 2, 2012",2012,1671,"['had', 'potential', 'be', 'great.1', 'love', 'norse', 'mythos.2', 'vocabulary', 'grammar', 'style', 'perfect', 'asgard.3', 'Loki', 'Thor', 'are', 'excellent', 'characters.4', 'excellent', 'match', 'music', 'mood.5', 'animation', 'style', 'bizarre', 'fantastic', 'production', 'bizarre', 'style', 'can', 'be', 'incredible', 'bad', 'production', 'bizarre', 'animation', 'style', 'disaster', 'are', 'parts', 'do', ""n't"", 'move', 'should', 'are', 'parts', 'move', 'more', 'would', 'ever', 'expect', 'are', 'foreground/background', 'details', 'vs', 'abstract', 'cartoons', 'are', 'too', 'disparate', 'yet', 'intriguing.But', 'end', 'story', 'just', 'bored', 'crap', 'me.Unending', 'dialog', 'little', 'action', 'hear', 'how', 'much', 'Loki', 'how', 'much', 'everyone', 'else', 'too', 'even', 'great', 'leap', 'saying', 'everyone', 'else', 'created', 'found', 'way', 'beat', 'fate', 'be', 'better', 'pathetic', 'thing', 'fate', 'be', 'everyone', 'else', 'helped', 'become', 'even', 'himself.If', 'was', 'even', 'little', 'evil', 'would', 'have', 'killed', 'disgusting', 'character', 'told', 'how', 'pathetic', 'was', 'almost', 'scene', 'instead', 'listening', 'words', 'deciding', 'what', 'might', 'really', 'mean.The', 'ending', 'was', 'just', 'sad', 'Was', 'supposed', 'be', 'cool', 'thought', 'provoking', 'Maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'predicted', 'was', 'just', 'sad.Since', 'Marvel', 'Knights', 'assume', 'was', 'comic', 'was', 'show', 'so', 'fans', 'comic', 'will', 'likely', 'love', 'show', 'not', 'I.So', 'give', '3', 'stars', '1', 'star', 'boring', 'pace', 'predictable', 'sad', 'ending', '4', 'stars', 'creating', 'big', 'emotional', 'response', 'Average', 'out', 'get', '2.5', 'so', 'rounded', 'up']",Marvel Knights: Thor & Loki Blood Brothers
1442529,AKV4KNED39L68,B0055CP9HC,"Bradley P. Valentine ""Ears picking up the sla...","[36, 47]","I have been aware of motion comics for a few years now, mostly from the Watchmen motion comic put together when that film came out.  Like a lot of people, I was really put off by it.  It wasn't good.  Didn't do justice to the story and it didn't do justice to the comics medium.  My thought was ""why does this exist?""  The answer seemed to be it existed as an alternative to the ""effort"" of reading.This is the prejudice I carried as other motion comics appeared as tie ins for shows like Spartacus: Blood and Sand, Inception, and Sucker Punch.  These grew a little better, but I wasn't moved.That is not until a few months ago when I saw other Marvel and DC efforts with motion comics.  I got really excited and began seeing the possibilities for motion comics as a genre.  I believe the first one to really get me was IRON MAN: Extremis.After that, I devoured everything else I could find, going from X-Men: Gifted to the Spider-Woman motion comic to Thor & Loki when that appeared on i-Tunes.  There were also some black and white Batman motion comics as well as some for Batgirl that were less inspiring but still excellent.However my excitment still lies chiefly with the Marvel efforts because they were the most involved, the most exciting and atmospheric.  Textured.  Artistic.  All of those descriptions come together in the drama Thor & Loki, which finally produces Motion Comics' first strong DRAMA.  It's worth a look.And I truly hope readers share my excitement and help support the medium, as I think it is and will be the most supportive and respectful to comic artists and painters that is likely to come along bridging the gap to video screens.It certainly shows the potential for artists who wish to produce pictorial or photographic narratives.",5,Another great example of an emerging medium,1310169600,"07 9, 2011",2011,1763,"['have', 'been', 'aware', 'motion', 'comics', 'few', 'years', 'now', 'mostly', 'Watchmen', 'motion', 'comic', 'put', 'together', 'when', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'lot', 'people', 'was', 'really', 'put', 'off', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'Did', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'comics', 'medium', 'thought', 'was', 'why', 'exist', 'answer', 'seemed', 'be', 'existed', 'alternative', 'effort', 'reading.This', 'prejudice', 'carried', 'other', 'motion', 'comics', 'appeared', 'tie', 'ins', 'shows', 'Spartacus', 'Blood', 'Sand', 'Inception', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'grew', 'little', 'better', 'was', ""n't"", 'moved.That', 'not', 'few', 'months', 'when', 'saw', 'other', 'Marvel', 'DC', 'efforts', 'motion', 'comics', 'got', 'really', 'excited', 'began', 'seeing', 'possibilities', 'motion', 'comics', 'genre', 'believe', 'first', 'one', 'really', 'get', 'was', 'IRON', 'MAN', 'Extremis.After', 'devoured', 'everything', 'else', 'could', 'find', 'going', 'X-Men', 'Gifted', 'Spider-Woman', 'motion', 'comic', 'Thor', 'Loki', 'when', 'appeared', 'i-Tunes', 'were', 'also', 'black', 'white', 'Batman', 'motion', 'comics', 'as', 'well', 'Batgirl', 'were', 'less', 'inspiring', 'still', 'excellent.However', 'excitment', 'still', 'chiefly', 'Marvel', 'efforts', 'were', 'most', 'involved', 'most', 'exciting', 'atmospheric', 'Textured', 'Artistic', 'descriptions', 'come', 'together', 'drama', 'Thor', 'Loki', 'finally', 'Motion', 'Comics', 'first', 'strong', 'DRAMA', 'look.And', 'truly', 'hope', 'readers', 'share', 'excitement', 'help', 'support', 'medium', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'most', 'supportive', 'respectful', 'comic', 'artists', 'painters', 'likely', 'come', 'bridging', 'gap', 'video', 'screens.It', 'certainly', 'potential', 'artists', 'who', 'wish', 'produce', 'pictorial', 'photographic', 'narratives']",Marvel Knights: Thor & Loki Blood Brothers

1442531,A3V3CTB2Y7UKRG,B0055CP9HC,Christopher Pelletier,"[0, 0]",Magnetic Dreams get it and I think they made some of the best motion comics Marvel has released.  Not sure why they stopped but their approach was better then what we have been getting more recently.  While the 3D models don't always work the care taken to making sure everything plays out more like a film and less like an experimental animation make it flow better then most motion comics.The voice acting might be the best in any of the Marvel Knights series I have seen yet and the story quite strong.  Loki's voice actor in particular is really good.  The story plays out like a Shakespeare play and it has a lot of good character moments.My only complaint is there are no chapters so you can't skip the intro and the episodes are longer then most other motion comics.  So if you have to turn it off in the middle you have to fast forward through it.

If this at all adheres to legend it seems like an interesting story. It doesn't really come out well here though.Here's the scoop. Loki has defeated Thor in combat. He now rules over the kingdom. He has Thor imprisoned in a dungeon (as he does others who he feels have wronged him) and plans to execute Thor at morning's light.What this has going for it is the art and language. There is almost no real animation here. Physical movement is kept to a minimum. But the design is pretty cool. The characters and their get-ups are designed well. The women are mostly voluptuous warrior types. Veritable wet dreams for adolescent boys. The language is of a near Shakespearean sound with very eloquent, flowery passages. Some of the thoughts run deeper that one might expect in this sort of outing.For my money the story was where it all fell apart. It goes fine for most of the running time then just sort of stops. The climax is not very....climactic. Loki comes to a realization quietly, and when he tries to right things he's treated to a big dose of irony. I did like certain things. Loki's entire focus is on beating Thor and grabbing the kingdom. But, once he has it, he doesn't really want it. He wants the kingdom without the responsibility of running it. And I liked his feeling of persecution. He confronts all number of people he feels slighted him over the years. He never seemed to know when people were nice to him.This isn't a bad watch.

My first one was a good one (now if I had started off with Iron Man: Extremis it would have been less so).  The story here is an enjoyable one as it focuses on the god of mischief who manages to enslave his brother and is bothered by the burdens of rule.  It's a hoot to watch the trickster slink off in the shadows to avoid the demands of Karnilla as if he's a simpering child avoiding his mother who he knows is going to demand that he mow the lawn!  The art, lifted from the comics and still credited to Esad Ribic, gives to a vainglorious Asgardian feel with plenty of tormented, tried, tired, and stretched faces slowly playing out over the screen.  The action is breakout in short moments, and few, but the story by Robert Rodi carries the weight.
