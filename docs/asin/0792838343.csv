140518,A3ONKRWEZMJJUV,0792838343,"Adrian Duran Sanchez ""Conductista""","[2, 5]","To begin with, Last Tango in Paris is a landmark in film history, it's Bertolucci's most psychological film, and a breakthrough conventional censorship, banned for almost ten years, Last Tango is brooding and sensual, raw and miserable, Maria Schneider appears here so voluptuous and everlasting, can't blame Brando's character (Paul), to become mad, she is both a child and a woman, a combination no one can resist (your sex doesn't matter), the ultimate object of sexual Catharsis, becoming wrath. This is a chamber piece, a conceptual story in the minds of its two protagonist, enters Marlon Brando; Paul's construction couldn't be more close to Brando's psychological truth, it is his most alike character, and Brando just exudes all of his unlimited potential, skills, and mastery of the acting art, delivering one of the most perfect performances in all movie history, a must for every student of acting and for any aspiring director in much concern of his or hers actor's performance. Complex, incomprehensible, silent in sorrow and in much pain, but completely lost in a duel because of his dead wife, this is Paul, egoist, manipulative, the world moves because of him, even at his lowest hour of pathetic self indulgent anal ways, Paul is everything inside the Apartment, and nothing outside of it. Enters Maria Schneider; Jeanne a French beauty (just in her early twenties), cast in a child like role with the sweetness and seduction of a Lolita, only this time is both voluptuous and dependent of a real man's love, Schneider is just unforgettable in this seductive character, and her performance is first class, a woman of its time: unbreakable, untouchable, daggling in distress, from there to discipline, all the complicated self-destructive bound,  because she's nothing, an object of animation, a subjective mannequin, beaten into submission, raping again and again.The apartment is the metaphor to their relation, un-scout even approaching the movie's end, it stands in much need of human candor, but the human condition won't let this happen, and Paul and his beauty will be forced to crash against one another, it's pure ruin and misery, and Bertolucci cages this and much more that doesn't meets the eye, with that masterful direction that only exist in the very best. Alas, it resembles the relation of a father with his daughter, with that daddy's care for her, and her Oedipus lust that can't be ignore, but doomed to die, shackled Paul's princess, Jeanne is here to carry with the burden of a long gone will to just be in comfort when the moment of excitement, that's why they don't need names inside the apartment; Frantic or Therapeutic?The photography is achieved with smooth and cold colors that only the erotic European films possessed in the 70's and 80's, Vittorio Sttoraro gives and unforgettable atmosphere to the story, he knew it by heard, and so Bertolucci, you will always remember the Tango Dance Contest Mad Scene, it is the very essential way of photography, direction, and real acting, all in one, based in a perfect and sensible raw script. The beautiful and haunting music score, adds more atmosphere and strength to the already powerful images.The DVD edition comes with an excellent transferring of the film, surely it looks as good as the day it was released, but the lack of additional material makes you want to know more about this mythical movie (the edition comes with a very illustrative eight page booklet, with inside information about the film's history, but a full length documentary would have give a much entertaining and depth view of the film), again the transferring is a fine work of good visuals and sounds, and the best of all, it is the uncut and uncensored version, as Bertolucci originally intended to be shown in Theaters back in the middle 70's, when everything was still uptight for such a film, there was no problem at all with the nude scenes, the problem was about the moral violence that the picture depicted in a way that no one had dare before to showed in the big screen, from there it came its heavily censorship, the psychological alternation of the most devastating loneliness and the filth and stink of the Human Insight Tremors, shown here with the intention to shock, not to move.

Tross,"[3, 4]","This is certainly a flawed film, not great in its totality, but Brando's monologue over his dead wife's flower strewn body is one of the greatest most affecting pieces of acting ever put on film and lifts the whole film to one that must be seen. Paris itself is a main character here and the choice of shots, the cinematography in general is absolutely superb, reason enough to see the film. Maria Schneider is stunning in a way no longer popular I'm afraid, and is well cast in this role though her acting skills show their weakness in comparison to Brando's (whose don't?). Her subsequent unhappiness with the way this film played out in her too short life does cast somewhat of a pall over the experience, and her complaints cannot be dismissed. There is an unwholesome voyeuristic aspect to this film that is somewhat squirm inducing at times. It is not that some scenes may or may not be pornographic, it is that they are much creepier and malign than most porn.Of course its hard to separate that quality from the bones of the story, that of a man seeking oblivion and connection simultaneously. He is Punishing his dead wife for the ultimate rejection of her suicide through the enforced obliterative anonymity he imposes on a much younger and vulnerable lover.He awakens at last from his dark psychological exile to realize that his nameless masturbatory object is in fact a lifeline, a fabulouslyattractive, and inexplicably devoted young woman. By this time of course she has become terrified of this man's obliterative power over her and flees in a panic to liberate herself ....I don't want to give away the end for those who haven't seen it.

140521,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0792838343,Andrew Ellington,"[8, 10]","Let me fist say this; if this film has offended you or left you thinking it nothing more than a pointless perversion then you've clearly missed this entire point and have misunderstood this films purpose.I felt that was important because I've seen this film get unfairly targeted by some who refuse to truly embrace it for what it is.  Yes, there was a lot of controversy that surrounded it upon its release; and that NC-17 rating doesn't help matters, immediately drawing the viewer to the obvious reasons for its harsh rating; but underneath the layers of sensuality lies a very poignant portrayal of a mans guilt and grief and how he chooses to free himself of it.  If you strip away the gratuitous love scenes you will begin to see into the deep pools of Marlon Brando's phenomenal performance and begin to understand why this film had to be made the way that it was.`Ultimo Tango a Parigi' follows Paul, a widower, shortly after his wife's suicide.  Still grieving and obviously searching to separate himself from the whole situation, Paul looks into renting himself an apartment.  It just so happens that young Jeanne is also there looking herself to rent the apartment.  In a spontaneous and completely anonymous moment of passion the two fall into one another and form a curious relationship that serves as a way out for Paul, a way for him to remove himself from all that is crashing in around him.Paul sets ground rules for the continuance of their relationship; first and foremost being that there is to be no names exchanged.  Writer/director Bernardo Bertolucci mentioned that the idea for this film stemmed from his fantasy of making love to woman without ever knowing her name; but what he created with `Ultimo Tango a Parigi' is a film that fully explores why that fantasy happens to be one every man desires.  He exposed the draw to such an encounter, allowing the audience to understand why a relationship with absolutely no strings is desirable yet disastrous.The one facet of this film that ultimately elevates it is the acting, all of which leaves me speechless.  Maria Schneider is marvelous as Jeanne; truly crawling inside of her and delivering a heartbreaking performance.  We are able to understand two sides of this tryst by comparing how Jeanne reacts versus Paul.  Schneider gives Jeanne enough humanity to create an honest portrayal of a woman confused and guilty for her own love and affection.  She wants to give herself fully to Paul but he refuses to accept her.  She is being pursued by her longtime boyfriend Tom yet she can't bring herself to be happy about it.  As the film spirals to its close we see the layers of this beautiful soul strip away to reveal a woman scorned by the seemingly selfish actions of a man.And yet still...The term `tour-de-force' was created for performances like Brando's.  His portrayal of Paul is seriously why the concept of `awards for acting' was though up.  One of the greatest compliments any actor can receive is that of being compared to Marlon Brando.  Why do you think his name is so rarely used when describing another actor's work?  Marlon Brando was incomparable.  What strikes me so hard about this particular performance is that it is fearless, and honestly there are so few fearless performances these days that when one like this comes along you are forced to take notice.  The performance isn't fearless because of the taboos his character is forced into, nor because of the dialog he is asked to say but because of the sheer dedication and veracity in which he attacks this role head on, delivering each word and confronting each taboo in a way that no other actor would dare.  Paul ultimately because a beautifully fleshed out variation of our own male psyche (or if you happen to be female then the psyche of your male counterpart).  His grief upon the sudden and abrupt loss of his wife is written all over his face yet effectively masked by his pursuit of young Jeanne and his complete and total domination of her.  One scene in particular, where he asks her to violate him, is truly breathtaking (and precisely the reason why I call his performance `fearless') for it allows us, in a not so pretty fashion, to see all that his wife's suicide has reduced him to.`Ultimo Tango a Parigi' is a marvelous film, a masterpiece at that, and rests firmly at the top of my list of greatest films ever made.  This is a film that is often misunderstood, true, but it is a film that is vitally important for it helps us to see the truth behind our own facades and confront the deeper meanings to the actions we so boldly take.",5,A tragically misunderstood masterpiece...,1212969600,"06 9, 2008",2008,4603,"['Let', 'fist', 'say', 'film', 'offended', 'left', 'thinking', 'nothing', 'more', 'pointless', 'perversion', 'then', ""'ve"", 'clearly', 'missed', 'entire', 'point', 'have', 'misunderstood', 'films', 'purpose.I', 'felt', 'was', 'important', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'get', 'unfairly', 'targeted', 'who', 'refuse', 'truly', 'embrace', 'what', 'Yes', 'was', 'lot', 'controversy', 'surrounded', 'release', 'NC-17', 'rating', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters', 'immediately', 'drawing', 'viewer', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'harsh', 'rating', 'layers', 'sensuality', 'very', 'poignant', 'portrayal', 'mans', 'guilt', 'grief', 'how', 'free', 'strip', 'away', 'gratuitous', 'love', 'scenes', 'will', 'begin', 'see', 'deep', 'pools', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'phenomenal', 'performance', 'begin', 'understand', 'why', 'film', 'had', 'be', 'made', 'way', 'was.', 'Ultimo', 'Tango', 'Parigi', 'Paul', 'widower', 'shortly', 'wife', 'suicide', 'Still', 'grieving', 'obviously', 'searching', 'separate', 'whole', 'situation', 'Paul', 'renting', 'apartment', 'just', 'so', 'young', 'Jeanne', 'also', 'looking', 'rent', 'apartment', 'spontaneous', 'completely', 'anonymous', 'moment', 'passion', 'two', 'fall', 'one', 'form', 'curious', 'relationship', 'way', 'Paul', 'way', 'remove', 'crashing', 'him.Paul', 'sets', 'ground', 'rules', 'continuance', 'relationship', 'first', 'foremost', 'being', 'be', 'names', 'exchanged', 'Writer/director', 'Bernardo', 'Bertolucci', 'mentioned', 'idea', 'film', 'stemmed', 'fantasy', 'making', 'love', 'woman', 'ever', 'knowing', 'name', 'what', 'created', 'Ultimo', 'Tango', 'Parigi', 'film', 'fully', 'why', 'fantasy', 'be', 'one', 'man', 'exposed', 'draw', 'encounter', 'allowing', 'audience', 'understand', 'why', 'relationship', 'absolutely', 'strings', 'desirable', 'yet', 'disastrous.The', 'one', 'facet', 'film', 'ultimately', 'acting', 'speechless', 'Maria', 'Schneider', 'marvelous', 'Jeanne', 'truly', 'crawling', 'delivering', 'heartbreaking', 'performance', 'are', 'able', 'understand', 'two', 'sides', 'tryst', 'comparing', 'how', 'Jeanne', 'versus', 'Paul', 'Schneider', 'Jeanne', 'enough', 'humanity', 'create', 'honest', 'portrayal', 'woman', 'confused', 'guilty', 'own', 'love', 'affection', 'give', 'fully', 'Paul', 'accept', 'being', 'pursued', 'longtime', 'boyfriend', 'Tom', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'be', 'happy', 'film', 'spirals', 'close', 'see', 'layers', 'beautiful', 'soul', 'away', 'reveal', 'woman', 'scorned', 'seemingly', 'selfish', 'actions', 'man.And', 'yet', 'still', 'term', 'tour-de-force', 'was', 'created', 'performances', 'Brando', 'portrayal', 'Paul', 'seriously', 'why', 'concept', 'awards', 'acting', 'was', 'up', 'One', 'greatest', 'compliments', 'actor', 'can', 'receive', 'being', 'compared', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Why', 'do', 'think', 'name', 'so', 'rarely', 'used', 'when', 'describing', 'actor', 'work', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'was', 'incomparable', 'What', 'so', 'hard', 'particular', 'performance', 'fearless', 'honestly', 'are', 'so', 'few', 'fearless', 'performances', 'days', 'when', 'one', 'are', 'forced', 'take', 'notice', 'performance', ""n't"", 'fearless', 'taboos', 'character', 'forced', 'dialog', 'asked', 'say', 'sheer', 'dedication', 'veracity', 'role', 'head', 'delivering', 'word', 'confronting', 'taboo', 'way', 'other', 'actor', 'would', 'dare', 'Paul', 'ultimately', 'beautifully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'variation', 'own', 'male', 'psyche', 'happen', 'be', 'female', 'then', 'psyche', 'male', 'counterpart', 'grief', 'sudden', 'abrupt', 'loss', 'wife', 'written', 'face', 'yet', 'effectively', 'masked', 'pursuit', 'young', 'Jeanne', 'complete', 'total', 'domination', 'One', 'scene', 'particular', 'where', 'violate', 'truly', 'breathtaking', 'precisely', 'reason', 'why', 'call', 'performance', 'fearless', 'not', 'so', 'pretty', 'fashion', 'see', 'wife', 'suicide', 'reduced', 'to.', 'Ultimo', 'Tango', 'Parigi', 'marvelous', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'firmly', 'top', 'list', 'greatest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'film', 'often', 'misunderstood', 'true', 'film', 'vitally', 'important', 'see', 'truth', 'own', 'facades', 'confront', 'deeper', 'meanings', 'actions', 'so', 'boldly', 'take']",N/A

It's not Brando. It's not the girl. It's not the vision. It's not the direction. The story, along with the dialogues, is what killed the movie. It is so boring that I feel I could have thought of an extreme film that did it up with such a style: Pink Flamingos. Last Tango in Paris literally let me down because it was going nowhere. There is nothing to like about it although I longed for thoughtful insights in the characters which never occurred. Rather, everything about Last Tango in Paris becomes drab and melancholy, me wishing the movie would've ended sooner. The nudity isn't much of a shock factor. Meanwhile, I read somewhere that Marlon Brando stated that he had absolutely no idea what was the movie all about. And neither do I. This film is not of Brando's kind, but he does an admirably nice job of holding himself up amidst the chaotic and meaningless story. All in all, the almost total freedom granted to Brando to express himself seems to have undermined the overall shape of Last Tango in Paris.8/13: Giving Last Tango in Paris another chance, I remain inconstant in my opinion of the film. It's just not a good picture. Marlon Brando has his moments, but he seems to have recycled a lot of mannerisms left over from The Godfather. So many times it is quite obvious when he is looking up or down, he is reading the cue cards. Other than that, there isn't much to go on about it. There is no story, and the pacing is dreadfully awful. The butter scene is the tipping point where I've tuned out. It's all about degradation of the female sex. What's so potent about that?

Too gifted, too successful, too soon; not quite enough struggle in the early years, I guess. All downhill, really, from the beginning, and a slide, finally, into endings as colossal flesh-mountains. Disintegration from self-indulgence. This is a difficult film to sit through, and, frankly, I admit to fast-forwarding it frequently. I've tried to watch it non-stop all the way, two or three times, but I don't think I've succeeded, although I've picked up most of the material by piecing it together in retrospect. It must be almost universally true that untouched improvisation properly never works. Art MUST consider the spectator. Actors, performers, are in the entertainment business: they that live to please should please to live.

One of the highlights that makes this movie great is without a doubt Maria Schneider's revealing nude scenes (...). She is also very pretty, however getting serious for a moment this film was in 1973 when it was release and still today a milestone in filmmaking largely due to Marlon Brando's outstanding performance. He really was one of the greatest actors of all times and his performance in Last Tango in Paris more than proves it. I really like the chemistry that both Brando and Scheneider had together through out the movie but especially in their key scenes together. Marlon Brando sadly enough passed away on July 1, in Los Angeles due to lung failure he was 80. Lucky for all of the people (myself included) who admired and appreciated his great talent as an actor, he left us a thrilling and fantastic collection of wonderful performances that are forever capture on film for all of us to enjoy time and time again.

It hasn't budged from that spot whenever I periodically see it again. Marlon Brando is simply incredible and this surpasses all of his other films, which is saying a lot. Director Bernardo Bertolucci let Brando improvise a great deal of the script and Brando fell back upon his own life to do it, including memories that dated back to his life with his own parents.  He wound these memories into the fictional life of Paul, who at middle age finds himself in a time of madness following his wife's suicide.  Paul attracts a young woman by his very unhingedness and she immediately becomes obsessed with him, both romantically and sexually, while he becomes sexually obsessed with her.  There are some brilliant soliloquies in the film, which Brando delivers, the best being the one he delivers sitting beside the open casket of his wife.  Brando was in his late '40s when he played Paul.  He was paunchy, his hair was thinning, he was crazy and you don't doubt for a moment this woman in her 20s falling madly for him.  Yes, it is sexually explicit but you will never mistake this for a porno film as it had to be one of the most serious films ever made about love, sex, death, loss and the human condition.  If you've missed it up until now, don't let another day go by without seeing it! Maria Schneider plays the young woman well throughout but was never seen much after this movie.

Colt ""It Just Doesn't Matter""","[7, 15]","I agree with the central theme of &quot;Last Tango&quot; and enjoyed some of the acting but overall I felt it was a very weak film and certainly not what I would expect from great masters such as Bertolucci and Brando.The film is about an American man named Paul (Brando) who cannot come to terms with his wife's suicide. He has a debauched and somewhat sadistic affair with a woman named Jeanne (Maria Schneider) whom he meets in an empty apartment. The lovers agree to meet each other as long as they adhere to Paul's insistence that they not reveal anything about each other's identity including their names and personal histories. They continue their torrid love affair for an unspecified period of time with several notable episodes. At one point with the assistance of some globs of butter, Paul pokes Jeanne in the posterior while making her recite some church liturgy. But in a moment of fair play, he subsequently insists that she clip her nails and provide him with a dual-digit rectal probe. All of this was scandalous in the early seventies but barely raises an eyebrow today, which is probably one reason why a lot of reviewers can't understand all the hype about the film's daring, revolutionary nature. Eventually Paul comes to terms with his wife's suicide and decides to pursue a conventional relationship with Jeanne. But as Jeanne correctly surmises, the two of them can only coexist under the conditions of anonymity that previously governed their relationship.Thematically, I am in complete agreement with the film. A relationship with emotional and sexual honesty can only take place in an environment that is free of obligations, identities and personal histories. But such a relationship is bound to be short lived. This theme was explored with much greater artistic depth and insight in &quot;Hiroshima Mon Amour&quot;.The acting left much to be desired. Brando being Brando has a few wonderful moments but generally comes across as grisly, semi-articulate slab of meat. This film could have been truly great if Bertolucci had paid attention to structure and dialogue and developed the story more around the anonymous sexual relationship. Instead, he simply threw the film's components together and declared it to be dangerous.

I guess it was Maria Schneider's bod that got me through the thing. Things like that matter a lot more when your hormones are gushing like some Parisian fountain instead of like a fine wine being decanted.  Yes, I'm aware that that's some pretty hokey mixing of metaphors. I'm just trying to say that Mlle. Schneider was hot then, and is hot now, but it takes more than that to get a viewer through this movie these days.The good news for my fellow geezers is that, after 30 years, my memories of the movie were almost gone.  It was like watching a new movie, so there's an upside to those senior moments.  I stopped saying, ""I don't remember this!"" after a while.There's a lot wrong with this flick, but the core of the plot is not without interest.  The main characters test each others love to the max.  Timing of their actions also comes into play, and has a great deal to do with the outcome of these lover's fates.  I see what the director/writer was trying to do, and if Brando had been controlled a bit more, the film wouldn't have come off as being a bit silly in so many scenes.I'm giving this movie 4 stars instead of the 2 it deserves because it's fun to watch Brando any place in the world, and Marlon Does Paris is much more fun if he wasn't in this one.  I think a lot of his dialogue must have been improvised, and his choice of words gives an insight into the mind and upbringing of this Nebraska boy.  I can't imagine that the Europeans came up with some of the earthy language that sounds like it came from a feed store in the good old USA rather than a Paris bistro.

Maybe it's Maria Schneider, one of the worst actress  I've had the opportunity to admire. Maybe it's the screenplay, so  perfect.THE LAST TANGO IN PARIS was a huge success in 1972, considering  the fact that Bernardo Bertolucci was at that time more appreciated by the  european marxist intelligentsia than by the common saturday night's  moviegoer. But Marlon and very explicit sex scenes provoked scandal and  success. It's fair to admit now that the majority of the audience was more  interested in Marlon and Maria's naked bodies than in the anarchic and  iconoclastic substance of the movie.One can like the symmetry of these  stories treating of the relations between symbolic fathers, mothers, sons,  daughters who could be symbols for society, death and I don't know what !

140544,A27CFNHYZG6WS8,0792838343,darragh o'donoghue,"[14, 22]","In 'Last Tango In Paris', Marlon Brando gives a performance that renders superlatives and previous notions about acting redundant.  In fact, replace the bland phrase 'gives a performance' with 'gropes' or 'bleeds'.  The film is at its best when content to simply follow Brando, his silent screams of anguish, his profane riffing, his bizarre improvisations, his anecdotal rambles and jazzy clowning, his desire and despair, his laughter and violence.  The most celebrated example of this is in a one-sided dialogue with his dead wife, quite but brutal sneers and obscenities collapsing into a terrifying grief, lonelines, incomprehension, need, loss.  The not uncomic juxtaposition of this emotional torrent, and its insentient, beflowered, mummified recipient adds a grotesqueness that only underlines the scene's power.  The film's brilliant coda, like a 70s cop show directed by de Sade, in which bathos and pathos are indistinguishable, is driven by Brando's reckless bravura (that English accent!) and inspired control.  Laugh?  Cry?  I nearly shot myself.A first viewing of 'Last Tango' can be one of the most gruelling and shattering experiences in the cinema, and one can completely understand why Pauline Kael flipped for it.  But this first viewing operates on an obscurantist level that scrapes the senses and emotions, but bypasses the mind.  You get caught up in everything that colours Brando's soulbaring - the grimy Francis Bacon aesthetic, with its ugly, predominantly brown monochrome mise-en-scene; the murky, claustrophobic interiors; the dismally ironic splashes of colour in blood red; the circus-ring arena in which the sexual affair between Paul, an American exile whose rich wife has just killed herself, and the young bourgeois Jeanne, daughter of a late, high-ranking military-officer, is played out, complete with poses, props, colours and creases from Bacon paintings that are supposed to express  internal traumas.  The title dance and the initial set-up - widower tries to find escape in anonymous sex - inextricably links sex and death, and determines a compositional style contesting absence and presence, darkness and light; as well as the atmosphere of sterility, depletion, disintegration and decadence that hangs over the film like a fashionable painting.Subsequent viewings reveal how far the director betrays his star.  It's as if there are two movies - the psychodrama Brando is intuitively feeling out, shot in tight, inescapable, long-take close-ups; and an arty intellectual exercise that flaunts its own technique and theoretical interests - the obsession with mirrors, reflections and shards to fragment the body; the doubling of characters; the psychological framework; the Godardian use of slushy music and composition as alienation effects; the sub-plot tripe involving Jeanne and her film-maker fiancee, with all its ideas about 'representation', 'the body', 'subjectivity' blah blah; the Marxist infusion of class and race etc.  This intellectual guff is like a prison from which Brando's flayed spirit tries to escape, just as the decor (more enterprisingly) is forever blocking characters from each other.  The tension makes for a fascinating movie - although the misogynistic scene in which a gummy granny putting her false teeth watched by the ripe young mini-skirted Jeanne, whose body the camera eyes up and down, unfortunately sets the tone - but for Bertolucci, the irreversible rot starts here.",3,A real experience that only works once.,1015200000,"03 4, 2002",2002,3453,"[""'Last"", 'Tango', 'Paris', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'performance', 'superlatives', 'previous', 'notions', 'acting', 'redundant', 'fact', 'replace', 'bland', 'phrase', 'performance', ""'gropes"", ""'bleeds"", 'film', 'best', 'when', 'content', 'simply', 'follow', 'Brando', 'silent', 'screams', 'anguish', 'profane', 'riffing', 'bizarre', 'improvisations', 'anecdotal', 'rambles', 'jazzy', 'clowning', 'desire', 'despair', 'laughter', 'violence', 'most', 'celebrated', 'example', 'one-sided', 'dialogue', 'dead', 'wife', 'quite', 'brutal', 'sneers', 'obscenities', 'collapsing', 'terrifying', 'grief', 'lonelines', 'incomprehension', 'need', 'loss', 'not', 'uncomic', 'juxtaposition', 'emotional', 'torrent', 'insentient', 'beflowered', 'mummified', 'recipient', 'grotesqueness', 'only', 'scene', 'power', 'film', 'brilliant', 'coda', '70s', 'cop', 'show', 'directed', 'de', 'Sade', 'bathos', 'pathos', 'are', 'indistinguishable', 'driven', 'Brando', 'reckless', 'bravura', 'English', 'accent', 'inspired', 'control', 'Laugh', 'Cry', 'nearly', 'shot', 'myself.A', 'first', 'viewing', ""'Last"", 'Tango', 'can', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'gruelling', 'shattering', 'experiences', 'cinema', 'one', 'can', 'completely', 'understand', 'why', 'Pauline', 'Kael', 'flipped', 'first', 'viewing', 'obscurantist', 'level', 'senses', 'emotions', 'mind', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'everything', 'Brando', 'soulbaring', 'grimy', 'Francis', 'Bacon', 'aesthetic', 'ugly', 'predominantly', 'brown', 'monochrome', 'mise-en-scene', 'murky', 'claustrophobic', 'interiors', 'dismally', 'ironic', 'splashes', 'colour', 'blood', 'red', 'circus-ring', 'arena', 'sexual', 'affair', 'Paul', 'American', 'exile', 'rich', 'wife', 'just', 'killed', 'young', 'bourgeois', 'Jeanne', 'daughter', 'late', 'high-ranking', 'military-officer', 'played', 'out', 'complete', 'poses', 'props', 'colours', 'creases', 'Bacon', 'paintings', 'are', 'supposed', 'express', 'internal', 'traumas', 'title', 'dance', 'initial', 'set-up', 'widower', 'tries', 'find', 'escape', 'anonymous', 'sex', 'inextricably', 'sex', 'death', 'compositional', 'style', 'contesting', 'absence', 'presence', 'darkness', 'light', 'as', 'well', 'atmosphere', 'sterility', 'depletion', 'disintegration', 'decadence', 'film', 'fashionable', 'painting.Subsequent', 'viewings', 'reveal', 'how', 'far', 'director', 'star', 'are', 'two', 'movies', 'psychodrama', 'Brando', 'intuitively', 'feeling', 'out', 'shot', 'tight', 'inescapable', 'long-take', 'close-ups', 'arty', 'intellectual', 'exercise', 'own', 'technique', 'theoretical', 'interests', 'obsession', 'mirrors', 'reflections', 'shards', 'fragment', 'body', 'doubling', 'characters', 'psychological', 'framework', 'Godardian', 'use', 'slushy', 'music', 'composition', 'alienation', 'effects', 'sub-plot', 'tripe', 'involving', 'Jeanne', 'film-maker', 'fiancee', 'ideas', ""'representation"", 'body', ""'subjectivity"", 'blah', 'blah', 'Marxist', 'infusion', 'class', 'race', 'etc', 'intellectual', 'guff', 'prison', 'Brando', 'flayed', 'spirit', 'tries', 'escape', 'just', 'decor', 'more', 'enterprisingly', 'forever', 'blocking', 'characters', 'other', 'tension', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'misogynistic', 'scene', 'gummy', 'granny', 'putting', 'false', 'teeth', 'watched', 'ripe', 'young', 'mini-skirted', 'Jeanne', 'body', 'camera', 'down', 'unfortunately', 'tone', 'Bertolucci', 'irreversible', 'rot', 'here']",N/A

The Gato Barbieri musical soundtrack is great, if you like jazz, and the reproductions of the great paintings by Francis Bacon establish the mood of the piece as the opening credits roll. It's all very artful. The film's soul, however, is not upbeat, the ending is a downer, as we say, and the relationship is a joyful, but confining dead end. The American bohemian played by Brando is seeking to achieve a love that is pure and free, but in the end his lover cares very much about status and class and will not be possessed by a nobody. The film either speaks to you or it doesn't. I have felt moved and affected in one showing, and then turned off in another. The relationship of an large, sexually cruel man with a young 'chick' has far less appeal these days, so one may find the film dated for its sexual dynamic. It is not so much that such relationships no longer exist, but that one may no longer find them exhilarating.

140548,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,0792838343,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[9, 11]","In 1972, a film titled ""Last Tango in Paris"" became one of the most controversial films of all time.Written and directed by Bernardo Bertolucci (""The Conformist"", ""The Last Emperor"", ""The Dreamers""), co-written with Franco Arcalli (""Once Upon a Time in America"", ""1900') and a French adaptation by French New Wave director Agnes Varda (""Cleo from 5 to 7', ""Vagabond""), the film would shock viewers at the time for its sexual violence and emotional turmoil.The MPAA gave the film an X rating and later revised 25-years later to receive an NC-17 rating.  But while the film would become a cover story in ""Time"" and ""Newsweek"" and receive notoriety, film critics such as Pauline Kael would say that the film ""has made the strongest impression on me in almost twenty years of reviewing.  This is a movie people will be arguing about, I think, for as long as there are movies"" (Pauline Kael, ""For Keeps, 30 Years at the Movies"", pg. 455).  Her review was so popular that it was used as a double-page ad in the Sunday New York Times and film critic Roger Ebert would describe Kael's lengthy review as ""the most famous review ever published"".Meanwhile, internationally the film would be sold out at various theaters, receive positive reviews from French publications and many would travel far just to watch the movie in France due to censorship.  Unfortunately, in Bertolluci's country of Italy, he was put on trial for ""obscenity"" as the Italian prosecutor called the film ""self-serving pornography"".  Bertolucci would serve a four month suspended sentence in prison and his civil rights revoked for five years, making him ineligible to vote.And now this controversial film receives its Blu-ray release in America in its original, uncut and uncensored version.""Last Tango in Paris"" revolves around two individuals.Paul (played by Marlon Brando, ""The Godfather"", ""The Fugitive Kind"", ""On the Waterfront"", ""A Streetcar Named Desire"") is a man who is mourning the suicide of his wife Rosa.  He can be seen looking disheveled walking around Paris with tears streaming down his eyes.Jeanne (played by Maria Schneider, ""The Passenger"") is a young 20-year-old who awaits her boyfriend, a young TV director and a filmmaker named Tom (played by Jean-Pierre Leaud, ""The 400 Blows"", ""Masculin Feminin"", ""Love on the Run"", ""Made in U.S.A."") to come home.  For the meantime, she is looking for an apartment to rent.Both individuals frequent similar areas but not one time did they look at each other.When Jeanne does find an apartment to look at, she notices that the man, Paul is there.  It appears that both are looking at the same apartment and it is not known who will get the apartment first.  But yet, she stays knowing he is there and is not afraid of him.  When she thinks he does leave, he just closed the door, goes up to her and immediately starts kissing her and both have sex in the apartment.After they have sex, the two don't have much communication but they go on their separate ways.For Jeanne, she is to meet Tom at the train and next thing you know, the whole interaction is being filmed by her boyfriend who wants to capture their love on 16mm, as cinema.As for Paul, when he arrives back home, he sees the woman cleaning the bath tub that is still filled with blood after his wife's suicide (she cut herself with a blade).The next day, we find out that Paul has rented the apartment for several days and both he and Jeanne will have anonymous sexual relationship.  The rules are simple, no names, no talking about anything of their personal life because none of it matters in the apartment.  The apartment is for them to have sex.Each time the two are together, Jeanne wants to know who he is but Paul reminds her to not talk about anything personal as the apartment is only for them to have sex.  They will not see each other outside of the apartment.With Paul, we see how much sexual anger that he has when he does things to Jeanne in the apartment, whether she wants to or not, she submits.  Outside of the apartment, Paul is a much different person.  As his wife's mother comes to visit their flop-house hotel (which Paul runs and originally belonged to his deceased wife's parents) in preparation for her daughter's funeral.  Paul treats her badly as she wants her daughter to be mourned in church, something he does want because she killed herself and the church does not respect those who kill themselves.  He is very condescending towards his mother-in-law and if anything, he is unsure of why his wife killed herself.  He has isolated himself in the hotel, no friends, just talking to those who stay at the hotel, including the man that his wife had an affair with.As for Jeanne, we learn that she is the daughter of a deceased colonel, living in a nice apartment with her mother and with her boyfriend Tom who is back, he wants to marry her by the end of the week.But while Paul and Jean have this secret sexual encounter for the next few days, how will they treat each other when they stop and see each other outside of the apartment and get to know each other for real?VIDEO:""Last Tango in Paris"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1 widescreen). First, its important for note that this is a 1972 film and for the most part, I was expecting to see some aging of the film.  Surprisingly, ""Last Tango in Paris"" looks fantastic on Blu-ray compared to its older DVD counterpart.  I think those who watch this film will be surprised to see the amount of detail and clarity that they will see while watching this film on Blu-ray.You can see the tears flowing through Paul's eyes, you can see the detail of his hairy arms, right down to the blood splattered after his wife's suicide.  There were details that I didn't recognize at first.  Such as the messy spotting on the mirrors and for the most part, I feel this is a pretty awesome upgrade on Blu-ray.But the picture quality is not entirely perfect.  I did notice a few debris but otherwise, the blacks are deep, skin tones are natural looking and overall, a pretty solid transfer.  And I just have to say that the cinematography for this film, courtesy of Vittorio Storaro (""Apocalypse Now"", ""Bullworth"", ""The Last Emperor"", ""Dick Tracy"") is magnificent!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Last Tango in Paris"" is presented in English Mono DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish Mono and French Mono.  The film is primarily dialogue-driven and features a score by Gato Barbieri.  But because it is a mono-track, don't expect immersive sounds coming from the surround channels.  But I will say that the dialogue is clear and that the film does showcase dialogue in English and French.  I detected no problems with the audio.Subtitles are presented in English SDH and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Last Tango in Paris"" comes with the original theatrical trailer.JUDGMENT CALL:One of the most controversial films of all time has received its Blu-ray release that is uncut and uncensored.Back in 1972, the film received an X rating, while now, it's rated NC-17.  Reading a summary or synopsis of ""Last Tango in Paris"" really doesn't give the film much justice.  For one, the efficacy of this film is in Bertolucci's filmmaking style of giving his actors a chance to bring out the character without guidance.For Marlon Brando, this is where he excels.  Call it improvisational, this is a man who took on the character of Paul and brought him to life.  And for many cinema fans at the time, many were clamoring for more Brando the year after ""The Godfather"", so needless to say, many were shocked to see him in such a film.As for actress Maria Schneider, you can tell that she fed off the energy of Marlon Brando.  Her character of Jeanne is a woman that has spunk.  She seems like a strong-willed individual but when she's at the apartment alone with Paul, she seems to crave this domination sexually by Paul.  She doesn't know what will happen and she definitely does not like the anonymity but she feels herself drawn to him or the danger of having sex with someone you don't know and will never know.There is no doubt about it, the character of Paul is about sexual domination.  Because of their anonymity, Paul feels he can do what he want, get what he wants and for Jeanne, she submits but she also does what she wants when she's in the apartment.  There is no love between Paul and Jeanne, it's literally a film about two people engaging in poisonous sex.You may be reading this and wondering ""what makes this film so controversial""?  Although there have been films since ""Last Tango in Paris"" that have gone even further such as Nagisa Oshima's ""In the Realm of the Senses"", you just don't get a magnificent actor such as Marlon Brando to be in such a film.  But it happened.You will see scenes where Paul gets a stick of butter that Jeanne has brought to the apartment and shoves it up her and sodomizes her while she cries in pain.  Another scene features Paul directing Jeanne to cut her nails and then to shove her fingers up him.These are just a few of those sexual scenes shown through the film.  But watching it now, especially in compared to Oshima's ""In the Realm of the Senses"", while we do see Jeanne completely nude throughout the film, for Brando, he is always seen wearing clothes when he has sex with Jeanne.  I often wonder if that was by choice of the director/Brando to show his domination while in clothes and then unzipping his zipper whenever he wants to partake in sex or was it because Brando didn't feel comfortable showing off his own skin.  Who knows?But I do know that for 1972, this type of content for a film was shocking.  Not only do you get a film that features spectacular cinematography, wonderful direction and excellent performance by Marlon Brando, it's very creative and artistic of how the sex was such a big part of this film but how the characters were portrayed.And it's quite interesting to see what happens when Paul stops going to the apartment and both individuals meet each other in reality.  I don't want to spoil the film but it was quite intriguing.Pauline Kael wrote ""Realism with terror of actual experience still alive on the screen - that's what Bertolucci and Brando achieve"".  She is absolutely right.  Despite Brando wearing his clothes during the act of sex, it's just the nature of how this film was shot and how Brando transforms to this immoral being, he brings out the self-centeredness of the character.  We are drawn to his personal view of society but at the same time, repulsed by him.  It's the efficacy of Brando's acting that made ""Last Tango in Paris"" work.  Without him, I don't even think this film would have registered as a blip on anyone's radar.Marlon Brando is one of the better examples of a method actor, one who takes on the persona of the character and somehow manages to live and breath that character and I wanted to know more about this.And this is where it comes down to the Blu-ray release and my feelings that I wish there was some post-interview or special feature included. I enjoyed the Blu-ray but the fact that its devoid of any special features (especially knowing how Bertolucci ""The Last Emperor"" was heavy on special features), you just felt that there should have been more to this Blu-ray.  But all one is going to find on this Blu-ray release is a trailer.Granted, this is the best looking and sounding version of the ""Last Tango in Paris"" to date.  It's a no-brainer that this Blu-ray release is a wonderful upgrade but at the same time, I just wished there was more to it, in terms of special features content.Overall, ""Last Tango in Paris"" is a film that definitely had an impact on cinema and for many, they consider it a Bertolucci masterpiece and perhaps Brando's greatest acting achievement.  The late Pauline Kael has said that some people will be very angry, some will feel disgusted.  Or like her, feel that the film is not only important but resonate strongly as a film with a major impact.Does this 1972 film still have impact on those of us today?  Probably not as much as it did back then, but if you are able to put yourself in the shoes of those who watched this film back in 1972, you can realize how bold and scandalous this film was at the time.  Will you love it or hate it?  I'll leave that up to you.",4,Blu-ray: One of the most controversial films of all time receives its Blu-ray release...uncut/uncensored but lacking any extras.,1300233600,"03 16,

140549,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0792838343,Dennis Littrell,"[7, 8]","On the cover of the paperback edition of my novel A Perfectly Natural Act there is the blurb: ""As compelling as Last Tango in Paris!""  (This is not a shameless plug since my novel is long out of print.)  When your work is touted as being ""like"" some earlier, successful work, you can be sure what is really being said is your work is not all that good and needs some hype to move it off the shelves.So it took me 33 years to finally get around to watching ""Last Tango..."" and that is all to the good because if I had watched it when I was young, the barbarous sexuality would have sorely distracted me.  Well, Maria Schneider (Jeanne) would have.  She is very sexy and is shown complete (""she comes complete""!) in a number of scenes.  Her acting ability has been challenged by some, but I thought she did a nice job in a difficult role.Problem was she was paired opposite Marlon Brando (Paul) who was busy giving one of his greatest performances.  Brando said some time afterwards that he never wanted to do anything like this again.  Presumably he was referring to the depressing nature of human sexuality portrayed in the film.  This is ironic since most of the raunchy and degrading lines are spoken by Brando who improvised them himself!  He later commented that some of the lines written by director Bernado Bertolucci were not to his liking.  What I think happened is Bertolucci wanted to live out as a director one of his youthful fantasies (raw, anonymous sex with a young beauty) and Brando, with his ultra sophistication about such matters, played his part with a brutal satirical edge, perhaps making fun of Bertolucci's fantasy, turning it into an unpleasant, hard reality.But the ""reality"" was a bit over the top for everybody.  The infamous ""Get the butter"" scene, which was improvised by Brando and Bertolucci (to Schneider's dismay), made it clear that Paul considered Jeanne an animal that you used and nothing more.  The dead rat scene and all the pig talk, ditto.  Brando was also projecting his own feelings.  He was 48-years-old when the film was released and was getting a paunch and losing his muscle tone.  All the sex scenes but one are filmed with Brando clothed so as not to make the decline of his physical prowess obvious.  He projected his own feelings about the decline of his body by referring derisively to his hemorrhoids, his prostate, and his paunch.What Brando does so very well here is become that animalistic, but thinking brute who has his way with women because they cannot resist his alpha male prowess regardless of the gray in his hair.  The early scene in the apartment when the nameless Brando just takes the nameless Schneider without so much as a spoken word or a caress might make women say ""if only more men could be so commanding,"" and men say ""I wish I had that kind of confidence.""  I am reminded of Brando's Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) except that here little is left to the imagination.  The Brando that was Kowalski at twenty-seven (with an I.Q. upgrade) could easily be the Brando that was Paul at forty-eight.Almost all the discussion about this movie is about Brando, and that is certainly understandable since, despite all the ugliness of the film, it featured one of Brando's greatest performances.  However, the movie was and is Bertolucci's.  He wrote it and directed it.  His original cut runs something like four hours.  The version here rated NC-17 runs 136 minutes.  The problem is that just about everything in the movie that does not included Brando is a bit of an anticlimax or an irrelevancy.  Jean-Pierre Leaud (Tom) of Truffaut's The Four Hundred Blows (1959) fame plays a film maker and Jeanne's intended.  He was possibly chosen for the film because his boyish style and demeanor would contrast so sharply with Brando's commanding style.  Two lovers had Jeanne: one was easy and boring, the other was scary and exciting.  But I think Bertolucci was also having some fun with the French cinema and especially with Francois Truffaut.  Perhaps it is only a coincidence that a year later Truffaut would release Day for Night (1973) (La Nuit americaine) in which Truffaut plays a director directing Leaud in a kind of pleasing but lightweight film contrasting sharply with the dark psychosis of Last Tango.I don't think I could sit through the four hour version but it might be a good learning experience for young film makers.  At any rate, perhaps some of the seeming illogic of the film might become reasonable, including the all too easy and not entirely explicable ending.  I rate this film very highly because it was innovative (rather shocking for its time), with a fine jazz score, but mostly because of Brando's stellar performance and the sensual beauty of a 20-year-old Maria Schneider.  By the way, the film is in French and English with subtitles.  Brando's French is amusing, and whoever dubbed Schneider's English has a cute and witty voice.Another excellent (and very beautiful) film by Bertolucci is The Conformist (1970) starring Jean-Louis Trintignant, Stefania Sandrelli, and Dominique Sanda.  Interestingly enough Sanda was originally picked for Last Tango, as was Trintignant, and she would have given some needed depth to Jeanne's character, but she declined I guess because of all the nudity.  Ironically a few years later Schneider was tabbed to play the lead in Luis Brunuel's That Obscure Object of Desire (1977) but dropped out during the filming reportedly because of a nude scene!  Maybe she was afraid of becoming typecast.I guess the bottom line on Last Tango is that it is an uncomfortable film illuminated by a veracious Parisian feel and a truly stunning performance by one of the greatest actors to ever grace the silver screen.",5,Stunning performance by Brando,1181433600,"06 10, 2007",2007,5758,"['cover', 'paperback', 'edition', 'novel', 'Perfectly', 'Natural', 'Act',

Like a famous painting, we've heard of it, but  hardly understand what the fuss is about.

Director, Bernardo  Bertolucci, is reputed to have spurred him on by relating, &quot;This film  is about your psychoanalysis... and mine!&quot; Brando responded by  offering us a chillingly realistic portrayal, of a man who's scraping the  bottom of the emotional barrel. Among other parts, the infamous &quot;pig  scene,&quot; and the delirious finale, will -- yet again -- convince you of  Brando's monolithic acting talent.It's regrettable that this film has so  many dead spots, and that the tale is too flat.

Terhune ""Ed T.""","[11, 13]","It's been said, by a reviewer whose name escapes me at the moment, that this is the last film where Marlon Brando looked good. Truth is, it's also probably the last film where Brando demonstrated why he was considered one of America's best actors. It's most definitely a flawed film. The scenes where Brando does not appear are pretentious and fairly boring. I tend to agree with the assessment of Ingmar Bergman, who opined that the storyline of this film actually would have made more sense if the 2 main characters had been played as gay men. Perhaps. Maria Schneider is very sexy, but she's just not a really good actress. And yet, when Brando is on screen, he's absolutely dynamic, enthralling, electric. Never before, and probably never again, will you witness a performance so raw, so unadorned, so revealing. Forget the sexual scenes that earned the film its notoriety. Check out Brando's soliloquy beside his suicidal wife's coffin. Or his ironic blend of tenderness and misogyny in his scenes with Schneider. Or when he weeps for...what? the impossibility of his romance with Schneider? His lost, blighted past? Or his silent, agonized finale when he sees for the final time the magnificent skyline of Paris. It's easy to become jaded by the films of today, watching as modern Hollywood's so-called stars perfunctorily perform their bland roles by rote, gearing their performances to the lowest common denominator possible. Watching Brando in his blistering and towering performance here reminds one of why acting can be considered an awe-inspring art form and why it was that I used to love going to the movies.",4,"A Great Performance, A Flawed Film",1087776000,"06 21, 2004",2004,1622,"['been', 'said', 'reviewer', 'name', 'moment', 'last', 'film', 'where', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'looked', 'good', 'Truth', 'also', 'probably', 'last', 'film', 'where', 'Brando', 'demonstrated', 'why', 'was', 'considered', 'one', 'America', 'best', 'actors', 'most', 'definitely', 'flawed', 'film', 'scenes', 'where', 'Brando', 'not', 'appear', 'are', 'pretentious', 'fairly', 'boring', 'tend', 'agree', 'assessment', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'who', 'opined', 'storyline', 'film', 'actually', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'sense', '2', 'main', 'characters', 'had', 'been', 'played', 'gay', 'men', 'Perhaps', 'Maria', 'Schneider', 'very', 'sexy', 'just', 'not', 'really', 'good', 'actress', 'yet', 'when', 'Brando', 'screen', 'absolutely', 'dynamic', 'enthralling', 'electric', 'Never', 'probably', 'never', 'again', 'will', 'witness', 'performance', 'so', 'raw', 'so', 'unadorned', 'so', 'revealing', 'Forget', 'sexual', 'scenes', 'earned', 'film', 'notoriety', 'Check', 'out', 'Brando', 'soliloquy', 'suicidal', 'wife', 'coffin', 'ironic', 'blend', 'tenderness', 'misogyny', 'scenes', 'Schneider', 'when', 'what', 'impossibility', 'romance', 'Schneider', 'lost', 'blighted', 'past', 'silent', 'agonized', 'finale', 'when', 'final', 'time', 'magnificent', 'skyline', 'Paris', 'easy', 'become', 'jaded', 'films', 'today', 'watching', 'modern', 'Hollywood', 'so-called', 'stars', 'perfunctorily', 'perform', 'bland', 'roles', 'rote', 'gearing', 'performances', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'possible', 'Watching', 'Brando', 'blistering', 'towering', 'performance', 'here', 'one', 'why', 'acting', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'awe-inspring', 'art', 'form', 'why', 'was', 'used', 'love', 'going', 'movies']",N/A

But, while working my way though the ""25 most controversial movies"" I decided to watch ""Last Tango"" over a period of two days.  At first, it left me confused, unimpressed, and repulsed by Brando, but not enough to stop watching.  The sex really isn't the draw to this movie, it's a film that is 'adult' in the most honest sense of the word.  I often find dealing with adult emotions messy, complex and contradictory, and this movie conveys that experience so well and in so many ways. The viewer is asked to confront things that go way beyond just two people having sex and talking dirty. Paul's feelings over his wife's suicide, dealing with his mother-in-law and his wife's lover would be enough to drive anyone over the edge!After just one viewing, I am not convinced this is a genuinely great film, but I do think there are some fine performances showcased here.  I really found the interaction between Paul and Jeanne fascinating, not the sex, but their conversations.  I found Tom and Jeanne's interactions to be snooze-worthy.  I know many people don't find Jeanne's performance to be that exceptional, but I really did.  She was very enchanting, innocent, but not nave.Frequently I write in my reviews here that I was not shocked or impressed by things that other people are shocked about in films.  Even though, I had read enough about the movie before watching it, I will say that the infamous ""butter"" scene did surprise me a little.  It's difficult to watch and there is nothing erotic about it for sure.The colours are appropriately subtle and compliment the feelings in the movie well.  Some of the film is in French with English subtitles.  Other parts are in English and it kind of goes back and forth.  I didn't find this to be a problem.  In fact the sound on the DVD I have is so low, that I almost prefer the subtitles, so I could get everything they were saying.  The music tends to be a little stridently loud in places as well.In the end, I kind of got my hopes up that these two were going to ""make it work"" or that Jeanne would save him.

The two meet by chance in an empty apartment--and immediately embark upon an anonymous affair in which Brando seeks to both purge and renew himself through Schneider.Both stars offer intense performances, and director Bertolucci invests the film with numerous poetic and symbolic flourishes.  The cinematography is elegant; the score is quite interesting.  But when everything is said and done, LAST TANGO IN PARIS is extremely thin stuff that relies on sexual shock to generate tension--and what was once shocking is now passe.  At the time TANGO was made, it was unthinkable that a major Hollywood star would appear in such a film... Yet by today's standards, the nudity involved is quite mild, the sex scenes are surprisingly discreet, and the script is oddly niave.  It all seems very tame.Moreover, the film's subplots slow the action to a crawl and the film as a whole has a self-concious, faintly pretentious tone.

140559,A1N40I9TO33VDU,0792838343,Grant A Thompson,"[25, 38]","Few films are as remarkable as ""Last Tango In Paris"" (1972) for having achieved so little with the immense possibilities of its concept, director, production crew and cast, or its romantic  location--Paris.Pauline Kael surely blushes at the pull quote attributed  to her on the DVD case, ""The most powerfully erotic movie ever  made!"". To be sure, we see that the gamin young Maria Schneider is a  fine figure of a woman, but her character, Jeanne, portrays the kind of femininity mythologised in machismo--a preparedness, even a desire, to be sexually humiliated, unmitigated even by the emphatic terms on which the relationship ends. The word ""love"" is used, here and there, in  extraordinarily barren circumstances. Paul (Marlon Brando's character) mumbles through the film with a degree of self-absorption approaching autism. There are widely separated good scenes, such as the tango  competition. The dialogue hardly ever gets better than Paul saying, ""I have a prostate like an Idaho potato, but I'm still a good stick man"".The claim of the film to have been ""the most controversial film of its era"" (fewer blushes, perhaps, for Leonard Maltin) rests not so much on its explicitness, but its emotional shallowness combined with uses of butter which could never be embraced by the dairy industry.So why see this film at all? Perhaps, to see how even a great chef, with excellent ingredients, may sometimes produce a flopped souffl&eacute;. To consider the question, ""What is (not) erotica?"". To study the career of Marlon Brando. Also, perhaps, to examine our own emotional development and to feel good comparatively about ourselves. Almost anyone will have deeper understanding and experience of love, or obsession, between men and women than is displayed here.For classy erotica, look elsewhere. Many better and more erotic and romantic films are based on similar themes of troubled characters in cross-cultural sexual obsession--such as Wayne Wang's ""Chinese Box"" (1997). As for making good use of Paris, check out Stanley Donen's ""Charade"" (1963), with Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, which is erotic only by suggestion, as well as having a sparkling and funny script, and enjoyable over-acting.Director Bernardo Bertolucci is far better than ""Last Tango"". So, even he has made a far better film about cross-cultural sexual obsession. He returns to the theme in his 1999 film, ""Besieged"". This makes wonderful use of one of the most photogenic and stagelike settings in Rome, the Spanish Steps and the Piazza di Spagna.

I can understand the shock waves that this film caused back in 1972, especially the casting of Brando in an X rated film.  It has a lot to like about it.  It has great performances (especially by Brando), great cinematography by Vittorio Storaio, a great music score (an underrated part of this film), and good supporting performances.  Jean Pierre Leaud is hilarious as a pretentious poser filmmaker, and Catherine Breillat, the great French filmmaker, plays the sound person in Leaud's crew.  She has one line ""dogs are more faithful than people"".  She might have written it herself.But I watched it recently, and while I still like a lot of it, it wasn't as shocking or as fresh the first time I saw it, which made me a little sad.  I am glad, however, that Bertolucci had a hit with this, as he got to make his incredibly ambitious epic, 1900.  Bertolucci has made many better films than this one, like The Conformist, 1900, and The Last Emperor.

Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[13, 15]","Since I don't have a copy of A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, I watched again for the fifth or sixth time this fine film to remember Marlon Brando on the day of his death. Every time I see this movie I'm amazed all over again at how good it is. Brando, nominated for an academy award for best actor for his performance here, is simply stunning. As always he takes over and commands any scene he is in. When the film was first released, most of the media attention was about the extremely naturalistic sex scenes between Brando, who plays a 45-year-old whose wife has just committed suicide, and Maria Schneider, a beautiful 20-year-old beauty about to be married. Then there was all the hoopla about the episode with the stick of butter, the fingernail trimming scene, etc. What many reviewers and critics overlooked-- as I recall it now-- was at its core this movie is not just another movie bordering on soft porn but makes extremely serious and profound statements about life: who of us can really know anyone else, love can be found in very unlikely places, the undercurrent of violence often connected with sex, all the ramifications of sex with a stranger, and what happens when lust turns into love, for instance.While Maria Schneider is certainly no slouch-- and a beauty both naked and clothed-- this film ultimately is Brando's. Kaleidoscopically he goes from the comic to rage to uncontrollable anguish and back again. The story is that he improvised many of his lines, giving his performance a very fresh, natural feel.The film is beautifully filmed and very visual. There are many images repeated-- the overground Metro shots for instance-- and scenes between Brando and Schneider lead into similar frames between Schneider and her young fiancee.This film is directed by another genius, Bernado Bertolucci and is like nothing else Brando did. He certainly gives one of his finest performances here.",5,A Bravura Performance by Brando,1088726400,"07 2, 2004",2004,1904,"['do', ""n't"", 'have', 'copy', 'A', 'STREETCAR', 'NAMED', 'DESIRE', 'watched', 'again', 'fifth', 'sixth', 'time', 'fine', 'film', 'remember', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'day', 'death', 'time', 'see', 'movie', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'over', 'again', 'how', 'good', 'Brando', 'nominated', 'academy', 'award', 'best', 'actor', 'performance', 'here', 'simply', 'stunning', 'always', 'scene', 'When', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'most', 'media', 'attention', 'was', 'extremely', 'naturalistic', 'sex', 'scenes', 'Brando', 'who', '45-year-old', 'wife', 'just', 'committed', 'suicide', 'Maria', 'Schneider', 'beautiful', '20-year-old', 'beauty', 'be', 'married', 'Then', 'was', 'hoopla', 'episode', 'stick', 'butter', 'fingernail', 'trimming', 'scene', 'etc', 'What', 'many', 'reviewers', 'critics', 'overlooked', 'recall', 'now', 'was', 'core', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'movie', 'bordering', 'soft', 'porn', 'extremely', 'serious', 'profound', 'statements', 'life', 'who', 'can', 'really', 'know', 'anyone', 'else', 'love', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'very', 'unlikely', 'places', 'undercurrent', 'violence', 'often', 'connected', 'sex', 'ramifications', 'sex', 'stranger', 'what', 'when', 'lust', 'love', 'instance.While', 'Maria', 'Schneider', 'certainly', 'no', 'slouch', 'beauty', 'naked', 'clothed', 'film', 'ultimately', 'Brando', 'Kaleidoscopically', 'comic', 'rage', 'uncontrollable', 'anguish', 'back', 'again', 'story', 'improvised', 'many', 'lines', 'giving', 'performance', 'very', 'fresh', 'natural', 'feel.The', 'film', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'very', 'visual', 'are', 'many', 'images', 'repeated', 'overground', 'Metro', 'shots', 'instance', 'scenes', 'Brando', 'Schneider', 'lead', 'similar', 'frames', 'Schneider', 'young', 'fiancee.This', 'film', 'directed', 'genius', 'Bernado', 'Bertolucci', 'nothing', 'else', 'Brando', 'did', 'certainly', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', 'here']",N/A

If you're a teenager (like me in 1973 I was 18) it became a shocking experience, but through the years, this film witha remarkable trio (Moravia, Bertolucci and Brando) altogether inscrbed their names and melt the real essence of the existencialism (beyond the stranger from Camus) , exposes with no estetic considerations the nakeness of the human being. Loneliness , hopeless, desesperation, two persons existing before living each one to their own way, sharing an apartment where they can be true for a while. And surrounded by a silence`s veil. The story is told by a shy camera, who spies like a peeping tom, all the corners of the room.And that finale in the dancerroom is an antology. The huge scream of pain couldn`t be told in a more dramatic style. The tango that certainly represents the hopeless and the blooded memory of that tha could have been and wasn`t, and the contrast with the nuance and touch of class that Paris means top us, it can be too heavy and awful for many viewers.

It was something totally different from anything I had ever seen, taking risks and using techniques never before used in any film I had seen.  One is reminded of some of the other cinema greats -- Fellini, for example, who weren't afraid to risk ridicule for their art.  The cinematography, the music, the script, were unlike anyting I had ever seen.  The idea that two people could meet in an apartment in Paris and have the most intimate of relationships, yet know nothing significant about each other -- the thought of this was fascinating.  Of course, all is bathed in the lurid light of the French apartment.Now that I am older and more jaded, I see this for what it is -- groundbreaking, and thus, dated.  Like ""Saturday Night Live"", nothing like it had been attempted before, so it seemed better than it really is.  I am sure it has been done better since.  However, a few things remain untouched and absolutely stellar:  1)  Brando's performance, which is incomparable in its pain and absolute believability 2) the musical score (by the great Gato Barbieri 3) the cinematography, only surpassed by Fellini.One must own this as one must own any classic.",4,A Watershed for the Provacateur,1158192000,"09 14, 2006",2006,1476,"['saw', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'very', 'limited', 'release', 'might', 'add', 'least', 'Maryland', 'was', 'age', 'Jeanne', 'insouciant', 'young', 'French', 'woman', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Maria', 'Schneider', 'so', 'sad', 'life', 'ended', 'so', 'young', 'tragically', '.I', 'was', 'completely', 'dazzled', 'obsessed', 'film', 'was', 'something', 'totally', 'different', 'anything', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'taking', 'risks', 'using', 'techniques', 'never', 'before', 'used', 'film', 'had', 'seen', 'One', 'reminded', 'other', 'cinema', 'greats', 'Fellini', 'example', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'risk', 'ridicule', 'art', 'cinematography', 'music', 'script', 'were', 'anyting', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'idea', 'two', 'people', 'could', 'meet', 'apartment', 'Paris', 'have', 'most', 'intimate', 'relationships', 'yet', 'know', 'nothing', 'significant', 'other', 'thought', 'was', 'fascinating', 'course', 'bathed', 'lurid', 'light', 'French', 'apartment.Now', 'am', 'older', 'more', 'jaded', 'see', 'what', 'groundbreaking', 'thus', 'dated', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'nothing', 'had', 'been', 'attempted', 'seemed', 'better', 'really', 'am', 'sure', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'However', 'few', 'things', 'remain', 'untouched', 'absolutely', 'stellar', '1', 'Brando', 'performance', 'incomparable', 'pain', 'absolute', 'believability', '2', 'musical', 'score', 'great', 'Gato', 'Barbieri', '3', 'cinematography', 'only', 'surpassed', 'Fellini.One', 'must', 'own', 'one', 'must', 'own', 'classic']",N/A
140566,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,0792838343,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[223, 231]","Marlon Brando's recent death affected me deeply. He has always been one of my favorite actors and I truly admire him for his extraordinary talent. During the last few weeks I have rented many of Brando's films and am still amazed, after all these years, at the force of his acting in ""Last Tango In Paris."" I believe that some of his best work was done in this film.Paul, (Brando), an aging American expatriate in Paris, comes home to discover that his marriage has ended. His French wife, Rosa, had slit her veins, leaving bloody bath water and spattered walls behind. She didn't leave much else - no good-bye note or explanation for her husband, parents or lover, a guest in the fleabag hotel she owned and managed. She did bequeath the hotel, and it's seedy occupants, to Paul. Overwhelmed with grief, Paul walks the streets and finds himself looking at an apartment for rent. He finds Jeanne, (Maria Schneider), a girl-woman, barely out of her teens, looking at the same apartment. She is to be married in a few weeks to her bourgeois, filmmaker fiancee. Paul and Jeanne circle each other warily in the empty flat, each contemplating the rental, (and each other), and wondering who will take it. Suddenly, they grab each other and have hard, fast sex against the apartment wall. Thus begins a most bizarre relationship.Paul makes the rules. Jeanne must follow them or she will not see him again. Their purely carnal relationship must remain anonymous, emotionless, and exist only within the walls of the apartment, which Paul rents for this purpose. There are to be no sexual taboos between them. He does not want to know her name or anything about her and refuses to give her any information about himself. They are not to see each other outside the apartment confines, nor even leave together. It seems as if Paul wants to bury his pain, his sense of betrayal and hurt in the mindless, sometimes brutal, act of sex. Director Bernardo Bertolucci's camera perfectly captures the impersonal nature of their coupling. The shots are blunt, without sensuality or eroticism, but an enormous sexual energy is captured. I think Jeanne is fascinated by the mystery that is Paul. She is bored, perhaps, and looking for something, maybe excitement. She is certainly intrigued by Paul's dominant role, and seems to enjoy playing the passive partner most of the time. She is clearly not happy with her boyfriend, who relates to her as the object of his latest film. He talks at her, not to her. And he does not listen. However, I do not see Jeanne as merely an object here, as do some others. The film focuses on Paul, not Jeanne.It is unfortunate that Ms. Schneider's career fizzled after this movie. She is excellent as Jeanne and perfectly captures her character's capriciousness, playfulness, bewilderment, vulnerability, anger, frustration, seductiveness and curiosity. Brando is simply superb. There are times, when he and Jeanne are together, that it appears as if he is extemporizing. He acts as if there is no camera filming him - as if he is not acting at all. There is one scene, where he is alone with his wife's body - she is layed-out in a coffin. Brando begins to speak to her and just loses it. His remarkable outpouring of guilt and grief is probably the best acting I have ever seen.Towards the end of the film there is a surreal ballroom scene where couples are dancing the tango. It is both haunting and memorable. The end is a bit of a letdown, but in a Brandoesque moment the actor comes to the rescue.Bertolucci was very effected by the work of painter Frances Bacon, considered to be one of the best artists of the 20th century. He chose Brando after seeing a Bacon painting ""of a man in great despair who had the air of total disillusionment."" The ""Last Tango In Paris,"" defined as ""the most controversial film of an era,"" brought Bertolucci to international attention. It was nominated for two Academy Awards. Vittorio Storaro's cinematography adds to the cold, remote ambiance.

Munson,"[6, 7]","Marlon Brando and Maria Schneider star in this powerful film about an older American man, a younger French woman, and the heights of sexuality and seduction.Brando stars as Paul, a 45-year-old American widower who's coming to grips with his wife's suicide.  His wife slit her wrists in the bathroom, leaving no note behind for Paul.  All that she left him was the ownership of the seedly flop-house motel she had owned.  Forced to deal with this bizarre change of events in his life, Paul goes out searching for an apartment.Schneider stars as Jeanne, a young 20-year-old Parisian girl.  She's sexy, vivacious, flirtatious, innocent, and adventerous all at the same time.  She's engaged to be married to her filmmaker boyfriend.  She, too, is looking for an apartment.By chance, Jeanne and Paul end up looking at the same apartment.  Both are intrigued; not just by the apartment, but by each other as well.  Soon, they are having rough sex up against the wall.  What begins after this encounter is a bizarre yet meaningful relationship which exists only inside the apartment.  No names are exchanged, no pasts discussed.  Only the present matters for these two tortured souls.  Their apartment has become a sanctuary where they can come together as one.As the movie progresses, it becomes apparent that Paul and Jeanne are truly falling for each other, but neither is sure how to proceed with the next step.  Unsure, Jeanne returns to the arms of her ""boyfriend"", while Paul struggles with his feelings for Jeanne.  Finally, he reveals his true feeling outside of the apartment, professing his love for Jeanne.  Will she believe it, or will something happen to shake up the ending?When this film was originally released in 1973, it drew the dreaded ""X"" rating for the sexuality and language.  Somehow, it was reduced to NC-17 for the DVD version.  Despite the rating, the movie is still very good.  Brando and Schneider are simply marvelous in their roles as Paul and Jeanne.  Brando's performance won him an academy award nomination.  I had a slight problem with the English subtitles, but it in no way affected how I felt about the movie overall.  The plot is extremely well-developed, and the characters fit perfectly into the story.  I highly recommend this great film.

140570,A2TAJ7OQD1P5I8,0792838343,Jenks,"[18, 22]","In this movie Brando gives, what was arguably the best performance of his career, as the widowed, distraught Paul, plunging into the very depths of nihilism and despair. However, what I did not like about this movie was the lack of character development for Jeanne (Schneider), the young Parisian, in which Paul (Brando) has his no names tryst with. I didn't understand why she fell for Paul, or why she was such a willing participant in these sexual escapades with him, was it low-self esteem, boredom, curiousity, what was it? I didn't really understand her.  Nor did I connect with her character, and in fact, felt less than sympathetic for her and at times found her to be quite annoying. Also I was disappointed with the movie's ending. I didn't mind him being killed, because he wanted to die--he simply didn't have the guts or the will to pull the trigger. But what I didn't like, was that all of a sudden, Paul falls for Jeanne...out of nowhere--WHY?! What was the turning point, it just didn't make sense. I felt it was contrived, unrealistic and somewhat partronizing and unfair to the two main characters in the film. There needed to be some justification for this sudden change of behavior.  I would have preferred Paul (Brando), after having his last ""encounter"" with Jeanne to simply disapear, and to have the audience along with Jeanne wondering, what had happened to him. Or perhaps would have preferred him becoming so delusional and broken from reality that he begins to see Jeanne as his dead wife Rose.  I even think there is a part where Paul (Brando) calls her Rose--this was only hinted at, but it should have been more fully developed but unfortunately it was not. So instead we are left with him, overnight metamorphisizing from a nihilist to a jubiliant fop who miraculously falls in love with Jeanne and madly pursues her and wants to build a life with her, yet still, without even knowing her name.Despite these flaws, however, I feel this movie is still magnificient, giving a look into the psychology and depth of grief, anger, nihilism and despair, which more than makes up for its flaws.  I found myself, deeply moved by Brando's performance. And realized he put alot of his own personal experiences into this movie, which for a Brando admirer, only heightened my appreciation for this movie.Visually this film has great coloration and is wonderfully shot, thanks to great cinematography by Vittorio Storaro. And the music by Gato Barbieri, is at times sultry as it is haunting.After watching this movie I was left feeling depressed, deeply moved, captivated and confused (because of the ending). Admittedly, in order to appreciate this movie, I had to be very open-minded. It's not a movie for everyone, nor is it a movie to gather the whole family around and eat popcorn and be entertained.  But if you are willing to be open-minded, which is key, and put yourself in someone else's shoes--who finds his own unconventional and disturbing way to deal with his own grief, then you may find, like me, that Last Tango in Paris, is a flawed masterpiece with empty pieces to the puzzle, but is still a masterpiece nontheless.",5,Depressive Disappointing and Remarkable all at the same time,1093046400,"08 21, 2004",2004,3153,"['movie', 'Brando', 'what', 'was', 'arguably', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'widowed', 'distraught', 'Paul', 'plunging', 'very', 'depths', 'nihilism', 'despair', 'However', 'what', 'did', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'was', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'Jeanne', 'Schneider', 'young', 'Parisian', 'Paul', 'Brando', 'names', 'tryst', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'fell', 'Paul', 'why', 'was', 'such', 'willing', 'participant', 'sexual', 'escapades', 'was', 'low-self', 'esteem', 'boredom', 'curiousity', 'what', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'did', 'connect', 'character', 'fact', 'felt', 'less', 'sympathetic', 'times', 'found', 'be', 'quite', 'annoying', 'Also', 'was', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'being', 'killed', 'wanted', 'die', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'guts', 'will', 'pull', 'trigger', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'sudden', 'Paul', 'Jeanne', 'nowhere', 'WHY', 'What', 'was', 'turning', 'point', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'felt', 'was', 'contrived', 'unrealistic', 'somewhat', 'partronizing', 'unfair', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'needed', 'be', 'justification', 'sudden', 'change', 'behavior', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'Paul', 'Brando', 'having', 'last', 'encounter', 'Jeanne', 'simply', 'disapear', 'have', 'audience', 'Jeanne', 'wondering', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'becoming', 'so', 'delusional', 'broken', 'reality', 'see', 'Jeanne', 'dead', 'wife', 'Rose', 'even', 'think', 'part', 'where', 'Paul', 'Brando', 'Rose', 'was', 'only', 'hinted', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'fully', 'developed', 'unfortunately', 'was', 'not', 'So', 'instead', 'are', 'left', 'overnight', 'metamorphisizing', 'nihilist', 'jubiliant', 'fop', 'who', 'miraculously', 'love', 'Jeanne', 'madly', 'build', 'life', 'yet', 'still', 'even', 'knowing', 'name.Despite', 'flaws', 'however', 'feel', 'movie', 'still', 'magnificient', 'giving', 'look', 'psychology', 'depth', 'grief', 'anger', 'nihilism', 'despair', 'more', 'up', 'flaws', 'found', 'deeply', 'moved', 'Brando', 'performance', 'realized', 'put', 'alot', 'own', 'personal', 'experiences', 'movie', 'Brando', 'admirer', 'only', 'heightened', 'appreciation', 'movie.Visually', 'film', 'great', 'coloration', 'wonderfully', 'shot', 'thanks', 'great', 'cinematography', 'Vittorio', 'Storaro', 'music', 'Gato', 'Barbieri', 'times', 'sultry', 'haunting.After', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'left', 'feeling', 'depressed', 'deeply', 'moved', 'captivated', 'confused', 'ending', 'Admittedly', 'order', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'had', 'be', 'very', 'open-minded', 'not', 'movie', 'everyone', 'movie', 'gather', 'whole', 'family', 'eat', 'popcorn', 'be', 'entertained', 'are', 'willing', 'be', 'open-minded', 'key', 'put', 'someone', 'else', 'shoes', 'who', 'own', 'unconventional', 'disturbing', 'way', 'deal', 'own', 'grief', 'then', 'may', 'find', 'Last', 'Tango', 'Paris', 'flawed', 'masterpiece', 'empty', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'still', 'masterpiece', 'nontheless']",N/A

The two lovers know nothing of each other, not even their names... Their affair is purely physical, and the barren apartment becomes, as Bertolucci intended, a world of debauchery on which is explored a catalog of behavior that seems more childish than kinky...Jeanne is a child-woman... She asks what she should call Paul, and they proceed to give themselves names brought only out of grunts, growls and screeches... Paul's cruelty is not justified and perhaps this is what attracts the modish girl... Some scenes emotionally are so provocative that you experience a wide range of feelings... Paul never asks Jeanne a direct question, but is constantly framing her for his next experiment, besides he assaults her, humiliates her and pushes her over the edge... There is one great moment for the heroine when she refuses Paul's power play and is equally unimpressed by his new declarations of love... She insists: 'It's over!' Brando delivers a stunning performance and Maria Schneider is quite convincing in what must have been a very demanding role.This isn't a flawless film but it is very good and offers more than just the average ""t&a;"" the genre has come to be known for. The film's subplots slow's the action to a crawl and the film as a whole has a self-conscious, faintly pretentious tone which I find myself drifting off at times.

Remington ""John Remington""","[63, 93]","Perhaps I may be speaking blasphemy to all the serious devotees of this prententious film ( I do respect you all though), but &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot; gets my vote as the most overrated film in cinema history (with &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; running a very close second.)Like &quot;2001&quot;, Last Tango did break new ground cinematically and for that reason these two films do deserve at least some respect. For its time, &quot;Tango&quot; was in its own way a cultural milestone in terms of its frankness and explicit sexuality. And because &quot;2001&quot; and &quot;Last Tango&quot; broke down many barriers, they did allow for many superior films to follow in their respective wakes. But I do agree with the other reviewers who place &quot;Hiroshima Mon Amour&quot; as far more complex and revealing work. &quot;Woman in the Dunes&quot; is also a superior film dealing with very similar subject matter.However, like the another &quot;X&quot; rated pioneer &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;, I just don't think &quot;Tango&quot; has aged well. Although &quot;Cowboy&quot; does hold up to better scrutiny.I find &quot;Tango&quot; neither illuminative, profound, original, erotic, or really compelling as a narrative. I found myself not connected in any way, or really caring at all for any of the characters. Many critics have continued to laud the film as brave. I'm sorry, I see nothing brave in photographing two hours of gravenous self pity.Stories ultimately are about the audience and not the characters, and no, I am not in denial when I say this film is not about me. &quot;American Beauty&quot;, a far superior film (which even contains humour- something this film doesn't know exists!) on all levels speaks to many of the same issues here and in a far more compelling (and entertaining!) manner.Marlon Brando grunts and sweats under his weary life as though everything is terribly important. In doing research on the film, I discovered that most of the dialouge is (not suprising considering its painfull meandering) mostly improvised. Marlon as &quot;Paul&quot; is really talking about &quot;Marlon&quot; the actor and dredging up an endless barrage of psycho-babble. It is no wonder that Marlon has turned his back on acting after this mess. I'm afraid far too many impressionable artists have tried to emmulate what passes as &quot;emotional truth&quot; here and therby destroyed their God given talent as Marlon did. What we get to see here really amounts to nothing more than a filmed therepy session. When the &quot;shocking&quot; ending finally unspooled, I found myself cheering that my ordeal was over.That really is sad for Brando certainly is (or whatever the appropriate tense)the single most influential actor of the 20th Century.The world does need a mature examination of the politics of sexuality and the high stakes carnality plays for. Since this film earned world wide critical acclaim and cult status, it set a crude sort of benchmark for taking things to the extreme sexually on screen. This isn't always a good thing.Besides &quot;American Beauty&quot; other films which deal with the same themes but far more successfully are &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot; and the tragic science fiction classic &quot;Seconds&quot;. This film  unfortunately doesn't reach the humanity of those other pieces.It certainly is worth watching though, so you can form your own opinion and gain a sense of pop cultural literacy, but for purchase?

Now that I'm older than Brando was when he made the film, much of that still seems true, but almost doesn't matter compared to the brilliance and depth of Brando's performance as a man trying to put the pain of his wife's suicide behind him by having a nameless, sexually adventurous fling with a much younger woman. I've also come to feel that Bertolucci was &#8211; at times &#8211; making fun of his own style as a film-maker (Jean-Pierre Leaud as Maria Schneider's more age appropriate boyfriend plays a somewhat vacuous wanna be auteur trying to capture life on film).

I have heard all the critics talk about Brando's signiture rolls namely as Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire, Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront, and Don Vito Corleone in The Godfather as his top performances. Of coarse they are all amaming, I own all three films and have watched them many times, but somehow Last Tango gets left out. Not all the time but most of it. In Paul, under Berolucci's direction, I think Brando created his most amazing and difficult performance. Most people wouldn't agree, but people who have really studied the actor as I have might. This movie is not so much about the characters in it or the simple plot that it follows, it is about Brando himself. Perhaps no other actor in history has fascinated people with his amazing talent only to have to watch him throw it away on low bugget films and cameo performances for big bucks. !I believe this is Brando's greatest performance because it is Brando. Watch him, listen to him, Paul is Brando. I think the defining moment for me was when he says to Maria Schnieder ""I been called by a thousand names, I would be better off being call by a grunt or a groan."" Likewise at the end of the film after he has been shot Schneider says ""he was a stranger, I didn't even know his name."" To me this is how the world perceives Brando himself. What do we really know about him? Everything or nothing. Brando to the public is like Paul to Schneider's character, he is an enigma. And he will stay that way. Brando has given some of the finest performances ever printed on film, but they were performances all the same. In Last Tango in Paris Brando stripped the method act and gave us the man. It is truely an amazing thing to see. After this film Brando did not perform for three years, and when he did start acting again it was only for the pay.

Erotic, however, is not a great word to use for this movie. Probably best known now as being the film in which Brando had to utter some of his more distasteful dialogue, the movie is, in final analysis, a rather memorable love story. While you might be able to boil its plot down to dead rats and casual sex, there is a lot more going on underneath the surface of the adult themes in this movie, with two of the most emotionally aloof characters you will ever meet in the movies. While I think that Pauline Kael might have been a little too embracing in her initial review, &#34;The Last Tango in Paris&#34; is something unique in movie history, distressing, weird, profane, bitter, and heartbreaking.The DVD itself features a passible print of the film, but it has not been restored or cleaned up one bit (but, actually, the gritty look of the image seems to match the gritty interior lives of these characters). I really wish an audio commentary would have been included (either by a film historian, or by Bertolucci himself--I have no idea as to why one was not included), but that would have been suffice.

140589,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,0792838343,Linda Linguvic,"[4, 7]","When this film first came out in 1972 it caused a sensation. Some of this was because of explicit intimate scenes which had never before been portrayed on a conventional movie screen . But it was also because it was an experimental art film which showcased incredibly fine acting and  the unique and the exceptional viewpoint of Bernardo Bertolucci, the writer and director.  I vaguely remember seeing in when it first came out but it is only now, almost 40 years later, that I can appreciate the artistic endeavor of the filmmakers.  This was a unique film in its day.  It was expected to usher in a new kind of dark and explicit filmmaking but it never did.  So it now it stands alone as an historical memory of an art film that upset and confused the public but never won their hearts and minds.The film is set in Paris and the language is mostly French.  Marlon Brando, a middle-aged American man is grieving for his wife who has just committed suicide.  Maria Schneider, then just 19 years old with the kind of fresh young beauty that pulls in the viewer in every scene she's in, first encounters Brando in a empty apartment when she is apartment hunting for her forthcoming marriage.  What follows is a torrid affair with the most explicit romantic scenes ever seen in a mainstream movie at the time.  Schneider is often nude and the object of Brando's rather perverted needs and these scenes are more sordid than titillating.The acting is over-the-top excellent, especially in a scene where Brando has a long monologue over the corpse of his dead wife.  The script is tight and there is not a wasted word even though it is hard to see exactly where it is going.  The atmosphere  is melancholy, the intimate scenes strong, explicit and somewhat upsetting as Brando dominates and the willing Schneider accepts this.  I was completely absorbed in it all, kept my eyes glued to the screen and quickly realized that this film is a small work of art that has been misunderstood.  Time has not diminished it and it stands alone as an experiment which provoked emotions that the public was not able to handle then and probably cannot handle now.",5,Time has not diminished the impact of this artistic experiment in filmaking,1310860800,"07 17, 2011",2011,2144,"['When', 'film', 'first', 'came', 'out', '1972', 'caused', 'sensation', 'was', 'explicit', 'intimate', 'scenes', 'had', 'never', 'before', 'been', 'portrayed', 'conventional', 'movie', 'screen', 'was', 'also', 'was', 'experimental', 'art', 'film', 'showcased', 'incredibly', 'fine', 'acting', 'unique', 'exceptional', 'viewpoint', 'Bernardo', 'Bertolucci', 'writer', 'director', 'vaguely', 'remember', 'seeing', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'only', 'now', 'almost', '40', 'years', 'later', 'can', 'appreciate', 'artistic', 'endeavor', 'filmmakers', 'was', 'unique', 'film', 'day', 'was', 'expected', 'usher', 'new', 'kind', 'dark', 'explicit', 'filmmaking', 'never', 'did', 'now', 'alone', 'historical', 'memory', 'art', 'film', 'upset', 'confused', 'public', 'never', 'won', 'hearts', 'minds.The', 'film', 'set', 'Paris', 'language', 'mostly', 'French', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'middle-aged', 'American', 'man', 'grieving', 'wife', 'who', 'just', 'committed', 'suicide', 'Maria', 'Schneider', 'then', 'just', '19', 'years', 'old', 'kind', 'fresh', 'young', 'beauty', 'viewer', 'scene', 'first', 'encounters', 'Brando', 'empty', 'apartment', 'when', 'apartment', 'hunting', 'forthcoming', 'marriage', 'What', 'torrid', 'affair', 'most', 'explicit', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'ever', 'seen', 'mainstream', 'movie', 'time', 'Schneider', 'often', 'nude', 'object', 'Brando', 'rather', 'perverted', 'needs', 'scenes', 'are', 'more', 'sordid', 'titillating.The', 'acting', 'over-the-top', 'excellent', 'especially', 'scene', 'where', 'Brando', 'long', 'monologue', 'corpse', 'dead', 'wife', 'script', 'tight', 'not', 'wasted', 'word', 'even', 'hard', 'see', 'exactly', 'where', 'going', 'atmosphere', 'melancholy', 'intimate', 'scenes', 'strong', 'explicit', 'somewhat', 'upsetting', 'Brando', 'dominates', 'willing', 'Schneider', 'was', 'completely', 'absorbed', 'kept', 'eyes', 'glued', 'screen', 'quickly', 'realized', 'film', 'small', 'work', 'art', 'been', 'misunderstood', 'Time', 'not', 'diminished', 'alone', 'experiment', 'provoked', 'emotions', 'public', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'handle', 'then', 'probably', 'can', 'not', 'handle', 'now']",N/A

140592,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,0792838343,magellan,"[13, 16]","This is one of those movies where reading the negative reviews is far more interesting and even funnier than reading the positive ones. The positive ones usually gush about what a groundbreaking movie it was, and its unvarnished portrayal of a completely carnal relationship lacking any other redeeming qualities. Brando is usually thought to have done a remarkable job portraying a depressed man who is trying to lose himself in an orgy of erotic self-indulgence after the suicide of his wife. Another common complaint is that the movie, although perhaps great for its time, hasn't held up very well.Amazingly, I had never seen the movie until a few days ago, and felt this was a huge lacunae in my cinematic education so I decided to watch it. While I'm not as negative as the other negative reviews, I have to admit that they have some validity. It was a ground and pathbreaking movie for its time, and it deserves some credit for that, which is why I give it at least two stars.Unfortunately, I have to agree with many of the other negative reviews here that the movie just hasn't aged well. I also agree with many of the other comments that in ad libbing much of the dialog, the script, or lack of one, suffers and it just sounds like Brando on some analyst's couch engaging in sophomoric psycho-babble much of the time. But one must remember that this was the inner-space obsessed and psychedelic 60s and things like psychotherapy were all the rage, which is why the movie just sounds like Brando on the couch free-associating much of the time. It was also a time of supposed sexual liberation, and in that sense the movie accurately reflects its milieu but attempts to ratchet up the shock value on the carnal side, from which the movie's notorious and vaunted reputation mostly seems to stem.While all of that is fine, and I'm certainly no prude, a movie whose main attraction is its portrayal of a steamy, nihilistic, and exploitative sexual relationship but which lacks any other redeeming qualities may be a good candidate for the most sexually and sensually daring and controversial movie of its time, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's a great movie, either. There is no character development, and no story arc beyond that of a dissipated, depressed, middle-aged man indulging his sexual fantasies with an ingenue.The dialog is mediocre at best, and except for the very emotional early scene by Brando, he spends most of the rest of the movie walking around like he's in a Quaalude-induced haze, although that drug was 15 years in the future. And by today's standards the movie wouldn't be considered sexually shocking at all. But then this was also the era of Leave it to Beaver which was considered a realistic portrayal of an American family. It's also one unremitting, humorless downer from beginning to end, as Brando wallows in his narcissistic world of grandiose and bottomless self-pity. This might have been okay for 15 minutes, but 2 hours of it is too much.So while I'm not as negative as many of the reviewers here, I can give it only 2 or maybe 2.5 stars. It certainly deserves some credit for breaking new ground in its portrayal of a sexually explicit and kinky relationship, there are one or two scenes in which Brando truly is great, and as one negative reviewer here said, it's something of an achievement to manage to make Paris look ugly.And last but not least, I hear the Cornhole Review rates it ""5 sticks of butter."" :-)",2,Overrated classic,1257552000,"11 7, 2009",2009,3458,"['one', 'movies', 'where', 'reading', 'negative', 'reviews', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'even', 'funnier', 'reading', 'positive', 'ones', 'positive', 'ones', 'usually', 'gush', 'what', 'groundbreaking', 'movie', 'was', 'unvarnished', 'portrayal', 'completely', 'carnal', 'relationship', 'lacking', 'other', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'Brando', 'usually', 'thought', 'have', 'done', 'remarkable', 'job', 'portraying', 'depressed', 'man', 'who', 'trying', 'lose', 'orgy', 'erotic', 'self-indulgence', 'suicide', 'wife', 'common', 'complaint', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'great', 'time', ""n't"", 'held', 'up', 'very', 'well.Amazingly', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'felt', 'was', 'huge', 'lacunae', 'cinematic', 'education', 'decided', 'watch', ""'m"", 'not', 'as', 'negative', 'other', 'negative', 'reviews', 'have', 'admit', 'have', 'validity', 'was', 'ground', 'pathbreaking', 'movie', 'time', 'credit', 'why', 'give', 'least', 'two', 'stars.Unfortunately', 'have', 'agree', 'many', 'other', 'negative', 'reviews', 'here', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'aged', 'well', 'also', 'agree', 'many', 'other', 'comments', 'ad', 'libbing', 'much', 'dialog', 'script', 'lack', 'one', 'suffers', 'just', 'like', 'Brando', 'analyst', 'couch', 'engaging', 'sophomoric', 'psycho-babble', 'much', 'time', 'one', 'must', 'remember', 'was', 'inner-space', 'obsessed', 'psychedelic', '60s', 'things', 'psychotherapy', 'were', 'rage', 'why', 'movie', 'just', 'like', 'Brando', 'couch', 'free-associating', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'also', 'time', 'supposed', 'sexual', 'liberation', 'sense', 'movie', 'accurately', 'milieu', 'attempts', 'ratchet', 'up', 'shock', 'value', 'carnal', 'side', 'movie', 'notorious', 'vaunted', 'reputation', 'mostly', 'stem.While', 'fine', ""'m"", 'certainly', 'no', 'prude', 'movie', 'main', 'attraction', 'portrayal', 'steamy', 'nihilistic', 'exploitative', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'other', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'candidate', 'most', 'sexually', 'sensually', 'daring', 'controversial', 'movie', 'time', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'mean', 'great', 'movie', 'either', 'character', 'development', 'story', 'arc', 'dissipated', 'depressed', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'indulging', 'sexual', 'fantasies', 'ingenue.The', 'dialog', 'mediocre', 'best', 'very', 'emotional', 'early', 'scene', 'Brando', 'most', 'rest', 'movie', 'walking', 'around', 'Quaalude-induced', 'haze', 'drug', 'was', '15', 'years', 'future', 'today', 'standards', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'considered', 'sexually', 'shocking', 'then', 'was', 'also', 'era', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'was', 'considered', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'American', 'family', 'also', 'one', 'unremitting', 'humorless', 'downer', 'beginning', 'end', 'Brando', 'narcissistic', 'world', 'grandiose', 'bottomless', 'self-pity', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'okay', '15', 'minutes', '2', 'hours', 'too', 'much.So', ""'m"", 'not', 'as', 'negative', 'many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'can', 'give', 'only', '2', 'maybe', '2.5', 'stars', 'certainly', 'credit', 'breaking', 'new', 'ground', 'portrayal', 'sexually', 'explicit', 'kinky', 'relationship', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'scenes', 'Brando', 'truly', 'great', 'one', 'negative', 'reviewer', 'here', 'said', 'something', 'achievement', 'manage', 'make', 'Paris', 'look', 'ugly.And', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'hear', 'Cornhole', 'Review', 'rates', '5', 'sticks', 'butter']",N/A

That apartment becomes basically a place to have sex and nothing else.  He will only agree to meet on the condition that they never reveal their names or anything about their lives, and never see each other outside of the apartment.  For most of the movie she wants more, trying to get him to open up and keeps coming back despite his cruelty.  In the end Brando's character chasing her, which leads to the finale of the movie.The movie will definitely not appeal to everyone.  I thought the pacing was kind of slow (hence knocking it down a star).  I think it could have easily had 15-20 min cut out and still told the same story.  I think the acting was good, but not great.  I am not an aficionado of Brando as some are, so I can't say I followed all his work, but personally I thought he was better in The Godfather than in this movie.  There is definitely a 1970s era feel to the movie, so if you are generally not a fan of movies from that time you probably want to skip it.

Even if you're a total Brando fanatic, you shouldn't have to subject yourself to this torturously slow film, which has no discernable point outside of its supposed shock value elements, which are only shocking because they're so tastelessly crass and boring, making the film utterly dated.  Brando's character in the film feels miserable throughout, and I think I felt at least twice as miserable while watching.  Even more annoying though are the laughably unconvincing scenes between Maria Schneider and Jean-Pierre L&eacute;aud, the latter of whom turns in an utter ham act.  After sludging through the first hour of this film, which drags on listlessly and at a snail's pace, you find that you just don't give a damn anymore what happens.  Although I can't exactly give Brando a thumbs up for taking on this role, I place the blame for this atrocity squarely on Bernardo Bertolucci, who directed and co-wrote the screenplay--having seen a bit of Bertolucci's other work as well, it seems that this guy should have his filmmaking license revoked.  About the best that can be said is that the picture quality of the film really is stunning, but even that ends up not being an advantage because it just makes the whole thing seem even more annoyingly 'arty' and pretentious.

Last Tango in Paris is my pick. Brando and the almost unforgivably beautiful Maria Schneider (also the first choice to play the lead in Bunuel's That Obscure Object of Desire) scorch the screen in this amazing film.Oddly, for the first fifteen minutes, I thought I was going to hate it. Jeanne (Schneider) is looking for an apartment. Very, very slowly. She encounters Paul (Brando) in one of them, and the two begin a torrid affair for no real reason we can discern (she is engaged but lonely; his wife recently committed suicide). He ends up taking the apartment, and the two continue their affair over the following days before Paul's wife's funeral, while Jeanne's fiance shoots a documentary film about her.Aside from the overly leisurely opening, Bertolucci mixes in the details of the two lives with their affair masterfully. The dynamics of their relationship, of course, change based on what's going on around them, and the whole thing meshes into an almost-perfect look at the dynamics of passion. The icing on the cake is Brando's monologue to his dead wife close to the end of the film; this is the scene that tabbed Brando for an Oscar nomination and won him a number of more minor awards for the film; it should also be noted that this remains the final X-Rated film to receive Oscar nominations, and was the only film rated NC-17 to have received them until Requiem for a Dream.

Needless to say, we both found it beyond shocking, truly horrible in its angst and rage and cruelty.  Brando, a damaged and unhappy man whose life is in ruins, meets an empty and inexperienced girl, who submits to his sado-masochistic ""numbers"" with incomprehensible passivity.  Perhaps she is bored, perhaps she wants relief from her bourgeois life - a clinging mother and unbearably insipid boyfriend - or wants to experience something raw and new, it is impossible to say.  It is like she is an empty vessel, an object, for the horrible things he does to her.  There is plenty of nudity, some iconic scenes like the butter one, but few normal human emotions.  The Brando character is pure despair and loneliness in an extraordinary performance.He sets the rules:  they meet in an empty apartment for sexual experimentation.  They are to tell eachother nothing of their outside lives, not even their names.  Their brutal meetings are interspersed with scenes from their lives, he in despair over the suicide of his wife, she on the path to a life with a filmmaker of the most idiotic pretension, filming their life yet afraid of any honest emotion with her.  They are both empty and lost.  It is pathetic.Gradually, they begin to learn about the other, in particular in descriptions by Brando of his unhappy childhood.  She is an innocent, too inexperienced to understand how Brando is using her and why, merely going along for the ride.  Schneider is beautiful, but her character is shallow, perhaps because of her acting she is not at all interesting beyond being a pleasure object.  When he tries to take it to another step, to meet outside the apartment, the ending didn't quite ring true to me, except for the casual indifference he felt towards his impending death.Seeing it again as a man older than Brando and after so many imitations and overly brainy conversations about it, I thought that the film was still quite good.  I didn't ""freak out"" the way I did at the first viewing, but the sadness of it all remains deeply affecting.  Sex and despair are no longer shocking to filmgoers as they were when I was young, but it is great art house cinema and worth a viewing for any film buff who is interested in the history of the medium.Recommended.

The frank dialog, the nudity, and the simulated sex were not gratuitously employed but were integral to the theme of the film, and if the picture was not totally successful, it was certainly unforgettable...Marlon Brando appears as a middle-aged American--but not the kind of American in Paris glorified by either George Gershwin or Ernest Hemingway... This is a man tormented by inner conflict... Brando's Paul between self-hatred over his wife's suicide and his feelings for Maria Schneider's Jeanne, she between her adoring documentary filmmaker fianc&eacute; (based wittily on Godard) and the taboo-breaking Paul...The stark, empty flat that is the lovers' retreat from conventional society, and the cold, windy pavement where Paul screams his loathing for the world against the din of a passing train--connects us with the mood of the film...Eager to escape the oppressive walls of his dark life, Paul embarks on a very complete sexual experience with a willing young woman in which there is no history spoken, no promises of future liaisons, no ties of any kind with the outside...The two lovers know nothing of each other, not even their names... Their affair is purely physical, and the barren apartment becomes, as Bertolucci intended, a world of debauchery on which is explored a catalog of behavior that seems more childish than kinky...Jeanne is a child-woman... She asks what she should call Paul, and they proceed to give themselves names brought only out of grunts, growls and screeches... Paul's cruelty is not justified and perhaps this is what attracts the modish girl... Some scenes emotionally are so provocative that you experience a wide range of feelings... Paul never asks Jeanne a direct question, but is constantly framing her for his next experiment, besides he assaults her, humiliates her and pushes her over the edge... There is one great moment for the heroine when she refuses Paul's power play and is equally unimpressed by his new declarations of love... She insists: 'It's over!'The film is beautifully shot... The cinematography is unique, somber, shadowy and painterly... It presents despair, and the music reinforce the despairing mood... The movie is also intensely erotic, intensely realistic, immensely disturbing... The extreme frankness makes faintly uncomfortable viewing, not only because of its sexual material but because of its exploration of our inner nature with true perspective... Hopefully, younger viewers can turn their minds back to a time when sex was mysterious and beautiful; dangerous and daring; not just easy and transitory... Sex nearly always implies intimacy, but doesn't always provide it...'Last Tango in Paris' is one of the great explorations of cinema's visual possibilities...

A product of the times, Brando is a nihilistic middle-aged widower who indulges - some say, forces - an anonymous sexual encounter with Jeanne, a young girl -- a total stranger -- in an empty Parisian apartment. Rather explicit in its sexuality and nudity, it was rated X.  It is still shocking.Maria Schneider is Jeanne and she sears her sensuality, vulnerability and innocence into the minds and hearts of viewers then and now.  The sex in the film is indulgent but not really shared by the characters.  That anonymity triggers a surprising feeling of victimization.  Whether intended or not, watching the film is more unsettling than arousing.The ""butter scene,"" a flash-point of conversation, was not even in the script, but something Brando suggested just before filming.  Although the sex was simulated, Schneider's tears were real.The world-wide attention to this landmark film brought instant fame and celebrity to young Maria Schneider.  It was not welcome.  She felt as if raped by Brando, Bertolucci and the audience.  ""Bertolucci is more of a gangster than a movie director.

He starts out by insulting her using the most degrading words possible.  He displays his confusion, hopelessness and abandonment and ends with an outpouring of his own unspecified...guilt.  There is a moment when we fear that Paul might attempt an act of necrophilia on the dead woman.In his 'relationship' with Jeanne we perhaps learn something of the nature of Paul's guilt.  He's a sado-masachist and, Jeanne, despite her beautiful body, is a child.  Therefore, there is a strong pedophilic component of the diseased relationship.  Jeanne reacts, not as an abused woman, but as an abused child.Paul forces the girl to drink the deepest dregs of sexual humiliation, depravity and degradation.  Sex is not for love but for hate....and the more hateful the better.  Jeanne, reacting as a child, comes back for more and more and the ending is predictable.  The very sick Paul is a sexual psychopath and Jeanne will die, either by her own hand, or by Paul's hand following or during an act of sexual perversion and torture.If there is any question about it, there is the last tango.  Jeanne tries to break free but, showing her conflict, performs an act of oral humiliation.  She runs but Paul pursues like a cat toying with a helpless mouse.  She runs, he runs.  She slows, he slows.  She flees up an elevator, he keeps pace on the stairs.  She escapes into her mother's apartment and Paul breaks in.Now all that is left is for the delicate, beautiful, completely confused Jeanne to die terribly.  But noooooo....After watching the film, and appreciating the fine acting, I searched for a redeeming feature of this excruciating and difficult film.  I think it's there but am not sure whether the writers, directors and producers of this film realized it.  For certain, none of the reviewers here--most of whom seem to have been dazed by Brando's fine acting and the girl, Jeanne's, perfect body--caught it.This is the intimate portrait of a sexual psychopath.

Before director Bernardo Bertolucci would hit his stride with emotionally and cinematically vibrant films like ""1900"" and ""The Last Emperor,"" he operated on a much smaller scale, preferring introspective dramas like this one.  Brando plays a skulking widower who throws himself into an increasingly disturbed fling with the sexually free young woman (Schneider) who falls for him.  As emotions boil to the surface, the two find themselves on a collision course with disaster.  The thin plot--made thinner by Brando's sometimes hokey ad-libbing--is just an excuse to watch these two performers, and this is where the film shines.  Brando has rarely been better; his Paul is a fascinating amalgam of rage, grief, and lust, driven mad by forces he can't control.  Schneider is stunning, both in portraying the conflicted sensibilities of a young woman who is simultaneously worldly and innocent and for just being downright gorgeous, undressed and otherwise.  The two have genuine chemistry onscreen, and in the handful of trysts they perform, are entirely believable as a couple.  That Bertolucci photographs them in warm light against squalid backgrounds adds an air of eroticism to a film that is more about the dangers of desire than the joys of romance.  As with ""Monster's Ball,"" though, its willingness ultimately to allow the performances to take center stage is both an asset and a liability for ""The Last Tango in Paris.""",4,Tremendous Performances/Thin Story,1118534400,"06 12, 2005",2005,1638,"['Marlon', 'Brando', 'tortured', 'performance', 'Maria', 'Schneider', 'sumptuous', 'beauty', 'drive', 'Last', 'Tango', 'Paris', 'otherwise', 'straightforward', 'arthouse', 'film', 'made', 'infamous', 'time', 'graphic', 'sex', 'scenes', 'director', 'Bernardo', 'Bertolucci', 'would', 'hit', 'stride', 'emotionally', 'cinematically', 'vibrant', 'films', '1900', 'Last', 'Emperor', 'operated', 'much', 'smaller', 'scale', 'preferring', 'introspective', 'dramas', 'one', 'Brando', 'skulking', 'widower', 'who', 'increasingly', 'disturbed', 'fling', 'sexually', 'free', 'young', 'woman', 'Schneider', 'who', 'emotions', 'boil', 'surface', 'two', 'find', 'collision', 'course', 'disaster', 'thin', 'plot', 'made', 'thinner', 'Brando', 'sometimes', 'hokey', 'ad-libbing', 'just', 'excuse', 'watch', 'two', 'performers', 'where', 'film', 'shines', 'Brando', 'rarely', 'been', 'better', 'Paul', 'fascinating', 'amalgam', 'rage', 'grief', 'lust', 'driven', 'mad', 'forces', 'ca', ""n't"", 'control', 'Schneider', 'stunning', 'portraying', 'conflicted', 'sensibilities', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'simultaneously', 'worldly', 'innocent', 'just', 'being', 'downright', 'gorgeous', 'undressed', 'otherwise', 'two', 'have', 'genuine', 'chemistry', 'onscreen', 'handful', 'trysts', 'perform', 'are', 'entirely', 'believable', 'couple', 'Bertolucci', 'photographs', 'warm', 'light', 'squalid', 'backgrounds', 'air', 'eroticism', 'film', 'more', 'dangers', 'desire', 'joys', 'romance', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'willingness', 'ultimately', 'allow', 'performances', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'asset', 'liability', 'Last', 'Tango', 'Paris']",N/A

We talked about how this is a ""male-eyed"" film, about how Schneider's character is never as fully developed, etc., etc.  (Frankly, I think a character who can utter the lines ""You treat me like a woahr,"" is pretty well-developed.)Almost 20 years later, I realize there's no way a class of 20-somethings could have appreciated what we were seeing, and thus the true greatness of the film eluded young, high-minded college students more interested in Maria's nipples than in Brando's angst.  For not once did any of us talk about the shattering scene where Brando confronts his dead wife.  If there's anything from Last Tango In Paris I took with me, it's that, and the amazing acting therein.  I really don't care about Schneider's boobs, which honestly aren't all that great anyhow.What makes this film great for me is the structure of an old(er), beaten down cynical man going through grief, who bumps into a young, fresh woman who doesn't really know who she is or why she wants what she wants.  Schneider has said that Bertolucci kept her in the dark during much of the filming.  One hopes it was to evoke this pure, almost wide-eyed performance from her and not out of any disrespect or cruelty, although Schneider late said she'd never work with him again.  Her performance here is effortless.  More importantly, there's a chemistry between her and Brando that works.  It may seem strange to talk about chemistry in a movie where the male lead rapes and bullies the female lead, but it's there.  Watch the scene in the bathroom, where he's shaving, and marvel at the spontaneous-sounding dialogue and the feeling that a real relationship is there.Brando is perfect for his role.  The story unfolds slowly (they'd never make a film with this kind of pacing today), and Brando becomes at least somewhat more sympathetic (and complex) as it goes on.  This isn't brute Brando but rather complex, deeply wounded Brando who brings out the brute in him only to keep the world at bay.  After his catharsis he shows another side of himself, probably a more typical side, to Schneider and she just can't cope--it's hard for me to tell, even after repeated viewings, if it's because she's getting married to someone else (how happy she'll be remains in serious doubt to me), because she's afraid of a three-dimensional Brando who really seems now to want her for more than casual sex, or what.  In some ways the ending was arbitrary, but it still struck me as more plausible and organic than similar sudden endings in The Night Porter and The Marriage of Maria Braun.Throughout, Bertolucci shoots most of the interior scenes between Schneider and Brando at sunset.  Bathed in orange, they have a stillness and yet an intensity the other scenes lack.  It seems orange is the color Bertolucci set aside for deep revelations and realizations.  The film is distrubing, but somehow also cathartic.  The feeling of wanting to say ""F--- the world"" is one many of us can relate to, something Brando himself did many times in his career.The print is scratched and the soundtrack somewhat tinny.  There are numerous times where dirt or fuzz in the gate can be seen on the top or bottom edge of the frame for whole scenes.  This is a film that cries out for a full-blown restoration.  The DVD contains nothing else but the trailer, and a strange trailer it is.  You'd think a DVD of a movie this famous would feature commentaries, documentaries, where-they-are-now type of featurettes, etc.  This classic has been short-changed.But *do* many people today see Last Tango In Paris as a classic?  This is somehthing I wondered as I read reviews online after seeing the DVD.  Heralded as a masterpiece and a turning point in cinema when it was released, it is now clear that it was anything but.  Rather than continue with personal films that sometimes disturbed the psyche and questioned the soul of the moviegoer, Hollywood and then other filmmakers turned to empty spectacle as the 70s waned, trading boobs for lightsabers.  Last Tango was hailed in 1972 as a beginning of a new cinema, but it was also the end of it.  With a few exceptions (The Unbearable Lightness of Being comes quickest to mind) this sort of film would never be made again, and Last Tango has become in some ways anachronistic.  Just reading the online reviews, most of them probably written by people in their 20s for whom Terminator 2 is an ancient movie, it becomes clear that we don't really understand this sort of picture anymore, and are made uncomfortable by it.  There's no simple line of action.  There's no ""plot.""  There are long stretches with no dialogue, or at least where the characters don't tell you in dialogue what they are doing.  As television and movies have merged in style, technique and subject matter, Last Tango and other films from the period become more like museum relics than living, breathing cinema.Perhaps that's one reason why we haven't seen a restoration.  Unless Criterion gets its hands on this film, I don't have much hopes.  Too bad, because Last Tango represents a whole type of filmmaking that's largely unknown today, even to film ""students,"" and if it is known it's becoming more of a curiosity than, as I said, living, breathing cinema.  All the more reason to rent this, then, and witness a whole approach to movie-making that no longer exists--certainly not in the USA.",5,One-of-a-kind film with a one-of-a-kind actor,1172448000,"02

140626,AV5G37VFE5NVD,0792838343,Tom Benton,"[18, 20]","The reputation of Bernardo Bertolucci's LAST TANGO IN PARIS precedes it.  Film critic Pauline Kael famously proclaimed it to be ""the most powerfully erotic movie ever made"", while the NC-17 rating and a few sour reviews led some to believe that the film was nothing more than high-class pornography.  This is one of the greatest tragedies in film history, because, you see, LAST TANGO IN PARIS is one of the very finest films ever made.True, the film does have four or five scenes of sexuality, some of it a little intense, but nowadays it seems rather tame.  The NC-17 rating is silly.  Were the film released today, I believe it would grab an R.  My point is that, contrary to what reviewers, the MPAA, and even the plotline may tell you, this film is not about sex.Marlon Brando plays a 45-year-old American living in Paris.  His wife recently committed suicide.  At the start of the film, Brando goes for a walk through Paris to escape from the confines of his blood-splattered apartment.  He happens to be walking the same path as Jeanne (Maria Schneider), a young Parisian dating a filmmaker.  The two unknowingly follow each other, as though commanded by fate, to an apartment building, where an apartment has recently been put up for sale.  Jeanne, overjoyed, looks the apartment over - only to find Brando sitting in the corner silently.  Their brief encounter ends with the strangers having passionate sex against the wall, beginning a relationship that will have an extraodinary effect on each of their lives.  The two strangers decide that they will meet regularly at the apartment, but that their relationship will be based strictly on sex.  Brando emphasizes that there will be no names mentioned in their time together; the outside world will simply cease to exist.Brando's character, it turns out, is named Paul.  Paul resembles a somewhat kinder Stanley Kowalski from A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE.  Whether due to his wife's suicide or simply his nature, Paul acts a little eccentricly.  He is usually in a good and playful mood around Jeanne, even when - especially when - Jeanne is not.  He always manages to cheer her up.  However, outside of their apartment, Paul is often angry, clearly on the edge, torn apart inside by his wife's death.  I do not exaggerate when I say that no one but Marlon Brando could play this character.  Brando puts equal emphasis on both sides of the character, and in typical Brando fashion he BECOMES the character.  I would say that, without a doubt, this is one of the very finest - if not THE finest performance - of Brando's entire career.Schneider deserves a lot of credit as well.  She does a marvelous job of bringing out the confusion and youthful innocence in the character of Jeanne.  Ultimately, we sympathize as much with her - perhaps more so - than we do with Brando's character.  Schneider also has some wonderful on-screen chemistry with Brando.Remember when I said that LAST TANGO IN PARIS is not about sex?  Well, what it is really about is life and relationships.  Through her sexual encounters with Paul, Jeanne becomes closer to him than she does to her own fiance.  Paul learns many surprising facts about his wife after her suicide.  In what is possibly the film's most moving scene, Paul talks to his wife's body.  ""Even if a husband lives 200 f-----g years, he'll never discover his wife's true nature,"" he says.  ""I may be able to understand the secrets of the universe, but ... I'll never understand the truth about you.""I feel that Bernardo Bertolucci, who directed and co-wrote the film with Franco Arcalli, has not received the credit that he deserves.  His directing, in particular, is extraodinary.  He gets the greatest performances possible from his cast.  He knows the perfect angles to shoot the scenes at, which results in some wonderful cinematography from Vittorio Storaro.  There are times when LAST TANGO IN PARIS seems like a very cold film, but through every moment it is bursting with life and vitality.Much of the film's vigor comes from Gato Barbieri's magnificent music.  It's an utterly beautiful score led by dazzling saxophone solos performed by Barbieri himself.  It is entirely without flaw.  Barbieri's score is undoubtedly one of the greatest in movie history.My purpose in this review has been to convince you that LAST TANGO IN PARIS is not what it seems.  It is such a great pity that the film has become only a minor classic, its reputation made foul by the controversy which emerged after the film's release in 1972.  The truth is that LAST TANGO IN PARIS is the reason cinema was invented.  It is true art, and in my humble opinion one of the very finest films ever made.  Viewing it is a profoundly emotional experience.  All I can say to you is to ignore everything you've heard about the film, and to simply watch it.  From the opening to the shocking conclusion, LAST TANGO IN PARIS is a true cinematic masterpiece.",5,A beautiful cinematic experience without flaw,1155513600,"08 14, 2006",2006,4925,"['reputation', 'Bernardo', 'Bertolucci', 'LAST', 'TANGO', 'IN', 'PARIS', 'Film', 'critic', 'Pauline', 'Kael', 'famously', 'proclaimed', 'be', 'most', 'powerfully', 'erotic', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'few', 'sour', 'reviews', 'led', 'believe', 'film', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'high-class', 'pornography', 'one', 'greatest', 'tragedies', 'film', 'history', 'see', 'LAST', 'TANGO', 'IN', 'PARIS', 'one', 'very', 'finest', 'films', 'ever', 'made.True', 'film', 'have', 'four', 'five', 'scenes', 'sexuality', 'little', 'intense', 'rather', 'tame', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'silly', 'Were', 'film', 'released', 'today', 'believe', 'would', 'grab', 'R.', 'My', 'point', 'contrary', 'what', 'reviewers', 'MPAA', 'even', 'plotline', 'may', 'tell', 'film', 'not', 'sex.Marlon', 'Brando', '45-year-old', 'American', 'living', 'Paris', 'wife', 'recently', 'committed', 'suicide', 'start', 'film', 'Brando', 'walk', 'Paris', 'escape', 'confines', 'blood-splattered', 'apartment', 'be', 'walking', 'same', 'path', 'Jeanne', 'Maria', 'Schneider', 'young', 'Parisian', 'dating', 'filmmaker', 'two', 'unknowingly', 'follow', 'other', 'commanded', 'fate', 'apartment', 'building', 'where', 'apartment', 'recently', 'been', 'put', 'up', 'sale', 'Jeanne', 'overjoyed', 'apartment', 'only', 'find', 'Brando', 'sitting', 'corner', 'silently', 'brief', 'encounter', 'strangers', 'having', 'passionate', 'sex', 'wall', 'beginning', 'relationship', 'will', 'have', 'extraodinary', 'effect', 'lives', 'two', 'strangers', 'decide', 'will', 'meet', 'regularly', 'apartment', 'relationship', 'will', 'be', 'based', 'strictly', 'sex', 'Brando', 'will', 'be', 'names', 'mentioned', 'time', 'together', 'outside', 'world', 'will', 'simply', 'cease', 'exist.Brando', 'character', 'out', 'named', 'Paul', 'Paul', 'somewhat', 'kinder', 'Stanley', 'Kowalski', 'A', 'STREETCAR', 'NAMED', 'DESIRE', 'due', 'wife', 'suicide', 'simply', 'nature', 'Paul', 'little', 'eccentricly', 'usually', 'good', 'playful', 'mood', 'Jeanne', 'even', 'when', 'especially', 'when', 'Jeanne', 'not', 'always', 'cheer', 'up', 'However', 'apartment', 'Paul', 'often', 'angry', 'clearly', 'edge', 'torn', 'apart', 'wife', 'death', 'do', 'not', 'exaggerate', 'when', 'say', 'one', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'could', 'play', 'character', 'Brando', 'equal', 'emphasis', 'sides', 'character', 'typical', 'Brando', 'fashion', 'character', 'would', 'say', 'doubt', 'one', 'very', 'finest', 'not', 'THE', 'finest', 'performance', 'Brando', 'entire', 'career.Schneider', 'lot', 'credit', 'as', 'well', 'marvelous', 'job', 'bringing', 'out', 'confusion', 'youthful', 'innocence', 'character', 'Jeanne', 'Ultimately', 'sympathize', 'much', 'perhaps', 'more', 'so', 'do', 'Brando', 'character', 'Schneider', 'also', 'wonderful', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'Brando.Remember', 'when', 'said', 'LAST', 'TANGO', 'IN', 'PARIS', 'not', 'sex', 'Well', 'what', 'really', 'about', 'life', 'relationships', 'sexual', 'encounters', 'Paul', 'Jeanne', 'closer', 'own', 'fiance', 'Paul', 'many', 'surprising', 'facts', 'wife', 'suicide', 'what', 'possibly', 'film', 'most', 'moving', 'scene', 'Paul', 'wife', 'body', 'Even', 'husband', '200', 'f', '-g', 'years', ""'ll"", 'never', 'discover', 'wife', 'true', 'nature', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'understand', 'secrets', 'universe', ""'ll"", 'never', 'understand', 'truth', 'feel', 'Bernardo', 'Bertolucci', 'who', 'directed', 'co-wrote', 'film', 'Franco', 'Arcalli', 'not', 'received', 'credit', 'directing', 'particular', 'extraodinary', 'greatest', 'performances', 'possible', 'cast', 'perfect', 'angles', 'shoot', 'scenes', 'results', 'wonderful', 'cinematography', 'Vittorio', 'Storaro', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'LAST', 'TANGO', 'IN', 'PARIS', 'very', 'cold', 'film', 'moment', 'bursting', 'life', 'vitality.Much', 'film', 'vigor', 'Gato', 'Barbieri', 'magnificent', 'music', 'utterly', 'beautiful', 'score', 'led', 'dazzling', 'saxophone', 'solos', 'performed', 'Barbieri', 'entirely', 'flaw', 'Barbieri', 'score', 'undoubtedly', 'one', 'greatest', 'movie', 'history.My', 'purpose', 'review', 'been', 'convince', 'LAST', 'TANGO', 'IN', 'PARIS', 'not', 'what', 'such', 'great', 'pity', 'film', 'become', 'only', 'minor', 'classic', 'reputation', 'made', 'foul', 'controversy', 'emerged', 'film', 'release', '1972', 'truth', 'LAST', 'TANGO', 'IN', 'PARIS', 'reason', 'cinema', 'was', 'invented', 'true', 'art', 'humble', 'opinion', 'one', 'very', 'finest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'Viewing', 'profoundly', 'emotional', 'experience', 'can', 'say', 'ignore', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'film', 'simply', 'watch', 'opening', 'shocking', 'conclusion', 'LAST', 'TANGO', 'IN', 'PARIS', 'true', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece']",N/A

Is this maybe Loehengrin and not a Bertolucci film?Of course this makes tremendous sense. Marlon is middle aged and not to attractive. Maria is 20 something and drop dead gorgeous. Marlon also comes across as a self pitying dope who cannot string two words together. In another scene he violently sodomizes Schiender. The plot of this film could only exist as a fantasy of a middle aged man.The climax of the film (an expression one hesitates to use for a range of reasons) is when the Brando character falls in love and wants to continue the relationship. Schnieder rejects him rather forcefully end of film.The film has sparse dialogue, Marlon looks dreadful overacts continually and one wonders how anyone took it seriously.
