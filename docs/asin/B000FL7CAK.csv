992419,AORXL977W3KI7,B000FL7CAK,Aging  Boomer,"[10, 109]","The first season of ""Veronica Mars"" was refreshingly free of politically correct cant.  The second season continues the first season's fine acting and production values, but the scripts, alas, are much more conventionally ""Hollywood"" than those of the first season.  Race, class, religion and sex get the standard Left Coast treatment; there is even an inept homage to ""Twelve Angry Men"" in which wise Hispanic and black jurors (and, needless to say, Veronica) overcome prejudiced middle-class whites.  The lowest blow is the depiction of Meg Manning's Christian parents.  I'm only halfway through Season 2 on DVD, but I half expect it will turn out that the Mannings blew up the bus.  Of course, in Hollywood's view, to be a believing Christian is per se to be a neurotic, sexually repressed, child-abusing, life-hating menace.  And guess what, that's what Meg's parents are!  They lock their youngest daughter in a closet after making her write ""The path to God is paved with righteousness"" hundreds of times. (How these folks raised such a nice girl as Meg is unclear.)  In typical fashion, these characters are never described as ""Christians,"" only as ""religious.""  Hollywood is arrogant but not courageous; it likes plausible deniability.  But the Mannings show little resemblance to Jews or Muslims; it's not hard to guess the precise nature of their ""religiosity"".  I hope, when he's a bit older, to watch this show with my son, and explain how it illustrates the bigotry and prejudice with which those of our faith are depicted by the Rob Thomases of the world.  Then perhaps I'll also explain to him how the path to God is indeed paved with righteousness, both Christ's and (imperfectly) ours.

992420,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000FL7CAK,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 4]","Sleuthing teen outwits both adults and intellects alike, while continually maintaining the highest GPA at Neptune High?  Is this feasible?  For those unfamiliar with this series would probably shrug this off as being just another colorful pre-teen drama that explores impossibility and stretches both the intelligence and believability of the viewer.  As an avid first season watcher (twice watched continuously all the way through), I am here to tell inform those reading this that Veronica Mars is possibly the most genuine, well written, developed television series to be released in years.  It has that potential to even out-impress the network poster-program Lost.  From the extended openings that pull you into each episode willingly or unwillingly, completely to the end of the episode that makes you salivate for more or question the theories that are rummaging through your mind, Veronica Mars (in this critics eyes) is the best that television has to offer.  Wit, charm, engrossing storylines, and characters that leave us with a craving for more is just scratching the surface of this program.  I began this series with mediocre expectations, but came out a die-hard fan.  While this second season boasted more complexity, I still found myself back at home in a little California town called Neptune.To begin, I need to get out into the open that I loved both released DVD seasons of Veronica Mars to the utmost extent.  I thought both brought a strong and epic struggle between evil and good to a small town in America, but I must admit there are some vast differences between the first and second season that may sour some avid viewers.  The second season is less tight with its storyline, yet somehow (and not to be too confusing) more complex.  It is obvious that creator Rob Thomas had a bigger idea than what the season would allow, OR he is building upon the idea that the third season would be further complex thus needing two full seasons to completely develop each and every storyline.  I only mention this because the only gripe I have of season two is the huge leaps and bounds that some stories seem to take.  Without giving too much away, the Duncan Kane story seemed too big for just the season alone, the underdeveloped Kendall Casablancas' story that was interesting but needed more, or the entire Dick/Cassidy story that teetered on a more sinister note than what we were shown in this season.  There was quite a bit happening in season two that left unfinished while the bigger story about the bus seemed to be a smaller piece than what it needed to be.  Alas, I guess that is what happens when you try to outgrow from the first, most amazing, opening season ever!I wanted to get that out of the way because it was the only issue that I had with this season of Veronica Mars.  The characters are what keep you coming back for more and more in this illustrious television series, and this second season doesn't let you down.  The development of the brother due, Bea...I mean Cassidy and Dick Casablancas was phenomenal.  Like I mentioned before, there is a darker story happening here and I hope that it only grows with the third season.  I enjoyed the development of our characters further.  I loved seeing Veronica struggle with both the pressures of high school as well as solving the mini-crimes around the neighborhood.  I loved the fact that for a couple of episodes in this season we obviously paid homage to Twin Peaks (doesn't every television show?) with a sinister development of the parents of Neptune.  Again, I think we are growing into a darker story that may erupt with season three ... mark my word.  I also enjoyed the newfound celebrity involvement with this second season.  Kevin Smith, Joss Wheton, Steve Guttenberg, ""The Todd"" from Scrubs, and even Harry Hamlin was back in full swing.  It just created a richer atmosphere for the show.  It was as if they had taken the strong elements of the first season, developed further, and brought us a superb contrast between characters and story.  It was a strong blend that needed to happen for this second season, and while we may have lost audiences due to the complexity (as well as if you missed an episode in this season you missed quite a bit), I think it pulled together well.  I just think we will be stronger satisfied with the third season.Overall, even with the slight downfalls mentioned above, I thought Veronica Mars did a fabulous job of uniting us with old friends and new acquaintances.  This is a powerful show that continues to be both (I apologize) fast and furious.  The writing is immaculate; Veronica's use of wit and language is amazing.  It is a show that forces you to become involved with what is happening, not just sit and be a viewer.  Veronica Mars pulls you deeply into the world of Neptune and will put a smile on your face while challenging your mind.  Up until the very end, you may have an idea of the truth, but until it is revealed, you are left with only ""I think...I think...I think"".  This show is pure brilliance and needs to be continued throughout many seasons to come.  Proudly I state, I am a Veronica Mars fan!!Grade: ***** out of *****",5,I wish I had a yellow Nissan X-Terra ...,1157760000,"09 9, 2006",2006,5177,"['Sleuthing', 'teen', 'outwits', 'adults',

The show is full of multi-dimensional characters who all contribute to the world of Neptune, California, while the show's mysteries are well thought out and executed.  So it's a wonder as to why so few people watch the show.Minor spoilers belowThree months after almost losing her life to the killer of her best friend, Veronica Mars' (Kristen Bell) life has settled down for the most part.  She has left the private investigation business to become a waitress at a coffee bar called Java the Hut (did I mention that the show loves to play around with names?), and is once again dating Duncan Kane (Teddy Dunn).  She left Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) after he was put through numerous trials and tribulations throughout the summer dealing with the death of a biker gang member.  Logan's inability to avoid trouble eventually drove Veronica away.  As the school year is ready to start, she is comfortable with her life.  Then she is pulled right back into the P.I. world when her best friend Wallace Fennel (Percy Dags III) fails his mandatory athletic drug test.  In addition, a few other non-09er (Neptune is a very rich town, and the rich kids are known as 09ers because their zip code is 90909) kids fail, as does Meg Manning (Alonna Tal), an 09er and ex-friend of Veronica.  The twist is that Meg was a friend to Veronica during their junior year; perhaps Veronica's only 09er friend.  However, Duncan and Meg dated in the previous season, and Meg blames Veronica for her break-up.  Needless to say Veronica finds the truth about the drug tests, but her victory is short-lived when a terrible bus crash takes the lives of 6 students (including Meg), a teacher, and the driver.Although the crash is originally thought to be the fault of a suicidal driver, evidence soon comes to light that indicates that someone sabotaged the bus.  Meanwhile, Weevil (Francis Capra), the leader of the biker gang with the member that died, is trying to get to the bottom of his friend's death.  While Logan seems to be the prime suspect, the pair both need to find the truth in order to save themselves.  Also, something from Wallace's past comes to Neptune after his mother accompanies Keith Mars (Enrico Collantoni) to Chicago.  Dick (Ryan Hansen) and Cassidy ""Beaver"" Casablancas (Kyle Gallner) also get expanded roles this year when their rich father marries a gold-digging step-mom, played by the wonderful (and hot) Charisma Carpentar.The side mysteries are all entertaining, but the bus crash is the most interesting and entertaining, and there are numerous new characters brought in to expand the mystery.  Woody Goodman (Steve Guttenberg) is the owner of the Neptune baseball team who is now running for mayor.  He hosted a field trip at the stadium, and the bus was returning from the stadium when it went over the cliffs.  Terrence Cook (Jeffrey Sams) is a former ballplayer who was present at the stadium.  His daughter Jackie (Tessa Thompson) provides for an interesting character study.  She begins the season as a typical 09er who is spoiled and bratty.  After getting some help from Wallace, they begin a relationship that drives Veronica nuts.  But when her father is implicated in the crash, the students of Neptune turn on her, much like what happened with Veronica prior to the beginning of the series.  It's interesting to actually see the character's fall from grace that was only described when Veronica told her story in the series' pilot.All of the actors deserve a lot of credit for their characters.  Bell and Dohring especially are able to breathe such convincing life into their characters.  Veronica and Logan are two of the most complex characters I've ever seen.  Veronica is still sarcastic and pessimistic, but she is beginning to let people like her again.  Logan displays more emotions in single episodes than some characters do in the entire run of their series.  Sometimes he is a brazen jerk, other times he is sensitive and sad.  Wallace's role increases from the sidekick he was in season 1 to a full-fledged character this year.  Keith, Weevil, and Duncan are all as great as they were in the first season, and all of the newcomers do very well.  Of note are Jackie, whose character expertly adapts to the twists of the series, and Cassidy, whose emotions are almost as ranged as Logan's.Most of the recurring guest stars from the first season return and get even more screen time this time.  Mac (Tina Majorino) and Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) are given expanded roles, and Mac starts a relationship with Cassidy.  Madison Sinclair (Amanda Norret), Cliff McCormack (Darran Norris), and Vinnie VanLowe (Ken Marino) all get their share of comedic moments, and many new characters show up, played by actors like Kevin Smith, Joss Whedon (of Buffy, Angel, and Firefly/Serenity fame!), Michael Cera and Alia Shawkat (of the wonderful Arrested Development), and Lucy Lawless.If there is one thing to nit-pick, it would have to be the resolution of the bus crash mystery.  Fans are very divided on the issue; some loved it and thought that it seemed very natural, while others hated the finale, claiming that it moved too quickly and created some plot holes.  Personally, I still don't know where I stand on the issue.  I will say that I was upset because it retconned something from the first season that I thought worked much better the way it originally ended up.  Still, despite a polarizing ending, the season as a whole is amazing and is deserving of your attention.Sadly, despite the great acting and excellent writing, the ratings for Veronica Mars were still fairly low.  They got picked up for the new CW network at the last minute (and there was a great Arrested Development-style in joke reference in the last episode of the season).  It's amazing that shows so great (hey, mainstream critics love the show, so it must be doing something right) can struggle so much while mediocre and formulaic shows thrive.  If you love good television, you will love Veronica Mars, so please check it out if you haven't yet and keep Veronica and the rest of Neptune around for years to come.",5,"Veronica Excels In Her

992437,AZKXH0J59TK11,B000FL7CAK,"Ben Dugan ""Ben Dugan""","[7, 7]","It is quite possible that ""Veronica Mars"" is the greatest show on television. It is the rare show that is infinitly watchable but rewards you if you watch it every week. It can be alternatingly funny and heartbreaking, clever and straight. The writting is consistantly the strongest on any television show currently on the air, and the show has a style all its own.For those who have yet to watch this second season when it was on the air on the UPN last year(I have actually met a few people who refused to watch it just so they could get this DVD and take it all in in one compacted week), let me just say that you are in for a treat. Multiple mysteries unravel each week, with at least three season long arcs and plethora of multiple episode arcs competing for attention. It is too the credit of the writers that the show never feels convuluted or complicated, probably because the writers always keep the focus of every story exactly where it should be, on the principal charactors. It also doesn't hurt that this season features the three best episodes of the show thus far: ""Donut Run"", the postively brilliant ""Plan B"" and the flawless, twisty finale ""Not Pictured"", where even a few lingering doubts are answered once and for all from season one. Where are the Emmy nods for this writting staff?Speaking of non-existant award nominations, ""Mars"" has, now that ""Arrested Development"" has gone the way of the buffalo, the best ensemble cast of any show currently on the air, anywhere. Not enough praise can be given to Kristen Bell and Enrico Colantino, who belong in a ""Thin Man"" movie thanks to their flawless delivery and timing, but the rest of the cast is equally good and underrated to the point of confusion. Francis Capra, who plays biker Weevil on the show, emits cool from his every pore, while Percy Daggs III, as Veronica's best friend Wallace, is the shows secret weapon, for lack of a better phrase. His cool, easy going charisma is the perfect counterpart to Bell's quickwitted charactor. The show wouldn't be half as good without the amazing Jason Dohring, as poor little rich boy Logan Echolls, an actor who never feels forced and seems to be having a great time playing the questionable Logan. Newcomer to the show Kyle Secor is also excellent in a key role. Only Teddy Dunn as Duncan fails to impress on the level of his co-stars, though playing a charactor who is on anti-depressants as a straight laced, slightly monotone cat may just be the greatest acting job ever. I have yet to make up my mind. And the litay of supporting charactors, most notably Harry Hamlin, who fans will recognize as Aaron Echolls from season one, Charisma Carpenter and the Gute himself, Steve Guttenberg(you read that right), are all excellent in important recurring roles.""Veronica Mars"" is a rare treat on television, a show that rewards you for paying attention and demands you have an attention span greater then that of a two year old.

Will it be able to match the genius of the first season? How can the new 'big mystery' even compare to the one we saw in the first season? Among others. However, there were a lot of questions left hanging once last season ended so if you took the time to watch it there's no way you're not going to watch the second season if you're seeking answers.What are the big mysteries this season? Here's only a sneak-peak:A bus crash.A murder.An unfolding drug ring.After a bit of a shaky first episode (there was A LOT of explaining to do which results in A LOT of flashbacks), everything else flows just as easily and perfectly as it did before. Veronica is still that sassy teen detective we all love. Wallace, thankfully, gets a much better and more detailed background. Keith continues his wonderful father role and digs his teeth into a couple juicy cases. Logan is still that 'love him or hate him' kind of guy, but we can start to understand why he is the way he is. Then there's Duncan. I'm still not big on him but he seems considerably less wooden this time around.Whether it's the mysteries that keep you coming back or it's the humor, just know that both those ingredients--and the seldom talked about intense emotional moments--are there in full force. Season two of Veronica Mars only solidifies why we love the show.

992462,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000FL7CAK,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 2]","You know, I got a confession to make: I hate these kind of shows. Not that they're bad, of course not. Well-written enthralling dramas with likable characters and it's that reason why I hate it: you get so wrapped up in it that I was watching it on DVD going ""...okay, just ONE more episode"" and sure enough I figure I'm only 2 discs away from finishing the season so why not just finish it off. Be warned: if shows like 24, Alias or Lost got you hooked, well this show is certainly gonna get you hooked deep.I haven't watched Season 1 yet(stupid stores don't even carry it for rent, let alone sale anymore) but essentially it's like this: the killer of Lilly Kane has been found but that's not all. Apparently, Logan is the prime suspect in the murder of a latino gang member, a PCHer and it only gets worse. Missing a bus ride back home from a field trip, she actually discovers the bus careened off the road, killing eventually everyone on board. Suicidal driver? Lost control? Or did someone cause it to crash?One thing I remember hearing about the first season was that the main storyline arc, the murder of Veronica's best friend Lilly Kane, gave the show an emotional resonance, a kind of drive. A bus accident, while it's more ambitious, has a detached feeling at times, almost like it's just a big long mystery to solve rather than a need to. However, the season is packed with other mysteries and little cases Veronica takes that helps the show along. One complaint was that when the suspect is outed and brought out into the open, you kinda felt like...""uh, him/her/them?""(I'm not spoiling who it is of course so might as well use all of those). While it's not a horrible whodunnit, and it does make sense, you almost feel like all that work was done by....um, the suspect(s). It's hard not to spoil this thing when you're writing it.What ultimately keeps the show together, apart from its characters, are the actors and luckily we have Kristen Bell as the titular sleuth. Sassy, funny, and showing a surprising pathos, she injects the character with a lovable quirkiness that even falls apart and breaks down. Yes, we all love our Jack Bauer bad***es but now and then, we fall for those characters with humanity. Then of course there's Enrico Colantini who is arguably the coolest dad who's likable and non...""dad""-like while still being tough and protection without being that strict militant dad. And what would a top rated show be without guest stars and we got lots, from Kevin Smith to Joss Whedon to Alyson Hannigan to Charisma Carpenter providing a season long role(and getting the Buffy fans riled up) with the last 3.Is there any complaints? Well one, the severe disappointment in the extras. Granted it is a season set show so you're not expecting something full-blown like a Lord of the Rings EE release but you get absolutely no commentaries, 2 sketchy featurettes and an admittedly funny gag reel and deleted scenes. Obviously wanting to be rushed before the third season starts, you get the feeling they just said hell with any substantial extras and just went for it. My Samurai Jack discs had more extras than this.If you're into these kind of shows you are going to get hooked easily. The problem though is that replayability isn't as kind. Shows like Smallville, Simpsons or X-Files were great because you could watch them out of order and still be enthralled while Alias, 24 and this show deserve to be seen from start to finish. So keep in mind while it will enthrall the first time, it's hard to watch them again without that captivation that had you the first time.",5,Unbelievably compelling TV,1156809600,"08 29, 2006",2006,3599,"['know', 'got', 'confession', 'make', 'hate', 'kind', 'shows', 'Not', ""'re"", 'bad', 'course', 'not', 'Well-written', 'enthralling', 'dramas', 'likable', 'characters', 'reason', 'why', 'hate', 'get', 'so', 'wrapped', 'up', 'was', 'watching', 'DVD', 'going', 'okay', 'just', 'ONE', 'more', 'episode', 'sure', 'enough', 'figure', ""'m"", 'only', '2', 'discs', 'away', 'finishing', 'season', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'finish', 'off', 'Be', 'warned', 'shows', '24', 'Alias', 'Lost', 'got', 'hooked', 'well', 'show', 'certainly', 'gon', 'get', 'hooked', 'deep.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'Season', '1', 'yet', 'stupid', 'stores', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'carry', 'rent', 'let', 'alone', 'sale', 'anymore', 'killer', 'Lilly', 'Kane', 'been', 'found', 'not', 'Apparently', 'Logan', 'prime', 'suspect', 'murder', 'latino', 'gang', 'member', 'PCHer', 'only', 'worse', 'Missing', 'bus', 'ride', 'back', 'home', 'field', 'trip', 'actually', 'bus', 'careened', 'off', 'road', 'killing', 'eventually', 'everyone', 'board', 'Suicidal', 'driver', 'Lost', 'control', 'did', 'someone', 'cause', 'crash', 'One', 'thing', 'remember', 'hearing', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'main', 'storyline', 'arc', 'murder', 'Veronica', 'best', 'friend', 'Lilly', 'Kane', 'gave', 'show', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'kind', 'drive', 'bus', 'accident', 'more', 'ambitious', 'detached', 'feeling', 'times', 'almost', 'just', 'big', 'long', 'mystery', 'solve', 'rather', 'need', 'However', 'season', 'packed', 'other', 'mysteries', 'little', 'cases', 'Veronica', 'show', 'One', 'complaint', 'was', 'when', 'suspect', 'outed', 'brought', 'out', 'open', 'kinda', 'felt', 'uh', 'him/her/them', ""'m"", 'not', 'spoiling', 'who', 'course', 'so', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'horrible', 'whodunnit', 'make', 'sense', 'almost', 'feel', 'work', 'was', 'done', '.um', 'suspect', 's', 'hard', 'not', 'spoil', 'thing', 'when', ""'re"", 'writing', 'it.What', 'ultimately', 'show', 'together', 'apart', 'characters', 'are', 'actors', 'luckily', 'have', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'titular', 'sleuth', 'Sassy', 'funny', 'showing', 'surprising', 'pathos', 'character', 'lovable', 'quirkiness', 'even', 'apart', 'breaks', 'down', 'Yes', 'love', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'bad***es', 'now', 'then', 'fall', 'characters', 'humanity', 'Then', 'course', 'Enrico', 'Colantini', 'who', 'arguably', 'coolest', 'dad', 'who', 'likable', 'non', 'dad', '-like', 'still', 'being', 'tough', 'protection', 'being', 'strict', 'militant', 'dad', 'would', 'top', 'rated', 'show', 'be', 'guest', 'stars', 'got', 'lots', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'providing', 'season', 'long', 'role', 'getting', 'Buffy', 'fans', 'riled', 'up', 'last', '3.Is', 'complaints', 'Well', 'one', 'severe', 'disappointment', 'extras', 'Granted', 'season', 'set', 'show', ""'re"", 'not', 'expecting', 'something', 'full-blown', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'EE', 'release', 'get', 'absolutely', 'commentaries', '2', 'sketchy', 'featurettes', 'admittedly', 'funny', 'gag', 'reel', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Obviously', 'wanting', 'be', 'rushed', 'third', 'season', 'starts', 'get', 'feeling', 'just', 'said', 'hell', 'substantial', 'extras', 'just', 'went', 'My', 'Samurai', 'Jack', 'discs', 'had', 'more', 'extras', 'this.If', ""'re"", 'kind', 'shows', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'hooked', 'easily', 'problem', 'though', 'replayability', ""n't"", 'kind', 'Smallville', 'Simpsons', 'X-Files', 'were', 'great', 'could', 'watch', 'order', 'still', 'be', 'enthralled', 'Alias', '24', 'show', 'be', 'seen', 'start', 'finish', 'So', 'keep', 'mind', 'will', 'enthrall', 'first', 'time', 'hard', 'watch', 'again', 'captivation', 'had', 'first', 'time']",N/A

992469,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B000FL7CAK,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[119, 132]","Thank you Warner Home Video, for releasing the second season of my favorite television series in August instead of waiting until October as you did for Season 1.For those looking for the true heir to Buffy the Vampire Slayer in terms of a sharp script and snappy dialogue look no further than the UPN show Veronica Mars. Not since Sunnydale dropped into a deep chasm has television seen such a fabulous ensemble of talented young actors deliver such inventive dialogue in intelligent, darkly humorously directed fare.For me Tuesday nights became the most anticipated TV night of the week and I could not get enough of the show or its hot star Kristen Bell. It quickly shot up the rankings on my TiVo season pass where it now sits at number one and my Kristen Bell TiVo wish-list was set to auto-record so I would not miss any program in which she was featured. I remember the anger when my local UPN station decided to air a baseball game instead of one episode - never have I felt more like putting pen to paper to express my displeasure with a programming decision.So what is this show that induces such passion? It's a detective show, no it's a romantic drama, or is it a dark comedy? Well, in reality it is all of this and more. Set in the California city of Neptune, it paints the picture of a society split between the have's such as the rich Kane family or movie star Aaron Echoll's children and the have-nots (notably title character Veronica Mars and her friends Wallace and Weevil).Veronica is the daughter of Keith Mars, the former Sheriff, who is now a private detective. The first season centered around the investigation into the murder of Veronica's best friend Lilly and  Veronica's rape and the second  season centers on the investigation into a bus crash that sent a group of students over a cliff to their deaths - a bus that Veronica was supposed to be riding. In addition a second mystery that is not resolved until later in the season is who was responsible for the death of Weevil's cousin Felix.But, as Veronica continues her investigation each episode involves the investigation into a lesser mystery. From who was responsible for the death of a classmates dog to the blackmail of gay studentsVeronica (with the help of Wallace, Mac and assorted other friends) must navigate a world of pirate radio stations, Irish gangs and still vie for the Kane scholarship, which would allow her to make her dreams of attending Stanford a reality.In addition to the great script the other strength of the show is in assembling a wonderful ensemble of young actors. Led by Kristen Bell who as Veronica outdo's Buffy in the dry humor department, and ably supported by Canadian actor Enrico Colantoni as Keith Mars, the two really display a true father-daughter affection for each other which apparently was true off-screen as well. In addition to this dynamic there is also Percy Daggs III as Veronica's best friend (and cohort in her investigations) Wallace and Jason Dohring appears as Logan, the bad-boy rich kid son of Aaron (played by Harry Hamlin of ""Clash of the Titans"" fame).Completing the talented young cast is Francis Capra as biker bad-boy Weevil and new to this season is the very appealing and spunky Tessa Thompson as Wallace's girlfriend Jackie. She was disliked initially by fans though as the season went on she became more popular - personally I had liked her from her first scene.This show needs to be seen to be believed. Sure I am a diehard fan of the show, but I defy any viewer not to became charmed by the drama, romance, humor and well drawn characters. Yes, the mysteries are solved but a lot of the fun comes in the journey towards those last episodes of the season. The season finale aired just last night and I was blown away by it. I was shocked and drawn in to every emotionally powered minute of it and fans across the internet are raving about it. Season 3 simply cannot come soon enough for me.On this DVD set of six discs we are promised a behind the scenes featurette, gag reel and deleted scenes which would be a vast improvement on the relatively bare-bones season 1 release. Warner Bros. was apparently surprised by the fan following that VERONICA MARS had developed during season 1 so they did not prepare adequately for that season's DVD release. Thankfully they were better prepared this time around.",5,Season 2 of the best show on television comes to DVD,1147219200,"05 10, 2006",2006,4354,"['Thank', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'releasing', 'second', 'season', 'favorite', 'television', 'series', 'August', 'instead', 'waiting', 'October', 'did', 'Season', '1.For', 'looking', 'true', 'heir', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'terms', 'sharp', 'script', 'snappy', 'dialogue', 'look', 'further', 'UPN', 'show', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'Not', 'Sunnydale', 'dropped', 'deep', 'chasm', 'television', 'seen', 'fabulous', 'ensemble', 'talented', 'young', 'actors', 'deliver', 'such', 'inventive', 'dialogue', 'intelligent', 'darkly', 'humorously', 'directed', 'fare.For', 'Tuesday', 'nights', 'became', 'most', 'anticipated', 'TV', 'night', 'week', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'show', 'hot', 'star', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'quickly', 'shot', 'up', 'rankings', 'TiVo', 'season', 'pass', 'where', 'now', 'number', 'one', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'TiVo', 'wish-list', 'was', 'set', 'auto-record', 'would', 'not', 'miss', 'program', 'was', 'featured', 'remember', 'anger', 'when', 'local', 'UPN', 'station', 'decided', 'air', 'baseball', 'game', 'instead', 'one', 'episode', 'never', 'have', 'felt', 'more', 'putting', 'pen', 'paper', 'express', 'displeasure', 'programming', 'decision.So', 'what', 'show', 'such', 'passion', 'detective', 'show', 'romantic', 'drama', 'dark', 'comedy', 'Well', 'reality', 'more', 'Set', 'California', 'city', 'Neptune', 'picture', 'society', 'split', 'have', 'such', 'rich', 'Kane', 'family', 'movie', 'star', 'Aaron', 'Echoll', 'children', 'have-nots', 'notably', 'title', 'character', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'friends', 'Wallace', 'Weevil', '.Veronica', 'daughter', 'Keith', 'Mars', 'former', 'Sheriff', 'who', 'now', 'private', 'detective', 'first', 'season', 'centered', 'investigation', 'murder', 'Veronica', 'best', 'friend', 'Lilly', 'Veronica', 'rape', 'second', 'season', 'centers', 'investigation', 'bus', 'crash', 'sent', 'group', 'students', 'cliff', 'deaths', 'bus', 'Veronica', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'riding', 'addition', 'second', 'mystery', 'not', 'resolved', 'later', 'season', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'death', 'Weevil', 'cousin', 'Felix.But', 'Veronica', 'investigation', 'episode', 'investigation', 'lesser', 'mystery', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'death', 'classmates', 'dog', 'blackmail', 'gay', 'studentsVeronica', 'help', 'Wallace', 'Mac', 'assorted', 'other', 'friends', 'must', 'navigate', 'world', 'pirate', 'radio', 'stations', 'Irish', 'gangs', 'still', 'vie', 'Kane', 'scholarship', 'would', 'allow', 'make', 'dreams', 'attending', 'Stanford', 'reality.In', 'addition', 'great', 'script', 'other', 'strength', 'show', 'assembling', 'wonderful', 'ensemble', 'young', 'actors', 'Led', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'who', 'Veronica', 'outdo', 'Buffy', 'dry', 'humor', 'department', 'ably', 'supported', 'Canadian', 'actor', 'Enrico', 'Colantoni', 'Keith', 'Mars', 'two', 'really', 'display', 'true', 'father-daughter', 'affection', 'other', 'apparently', 'was', 'true', 'off-screen', 'well', 'addition', 'dynamic', 'also', 'Percy', 'Daggs', 'III', 'Veronica', 'best', 'friend', 'cohort', 'investigations', 'Wallace', 'Jason', 'Dohring', 'Logan', 'bad-boy', 'rich', 'kid', 'son', 'Aaron', 'played', 'Harry', 'Hamlin', 'Clash', 'Titans', 'fame', '.Completing', 'talented', 'young', 'cast', 'Francis', 'Capra', 'biker', 'bad-boy', 'Weevil', 'new', 'season', 'very', 'appealing', 'spunky', 'Tessa', 'Thompson', 'Wallace', 'girlfriend', 'Jackie', 'was', 'disliked', 'initially', 'fans', 'season', 'went', 'became', 'more', 'popular', 'personally', 'had', 'liked', 'first', 'scene.This', 'show', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'Sure', 'am', 'diehard', 'fan', 'show', 'defy', 'viewer', 'not', 'became', 'charmed', 'drama', 'romance', 'humor', 'well', 'drawn', 'characters', 'Yes', 'mysteries', 'are', 'solved', 'lot', 'fun', 'journey', 'towards', 'last', 'episodes', 'season', 'season', 'finale', 'aired', 'just', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'was', 'shocked', 'drawn', 'emotionally', 'powered', 'minute', 'fans', 'internet', 'are', 'raving', 'Season', '3', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'come', 'soon', 'enough', 'me.On', 'DVD', 'set', 'six', 'discs', 'are', 'promised', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'gag', 'reel', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'would', 'be', 'vast', 'improvement', 'relatively', 'bare-bones', 'season', '1', 'release', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'was', 'apparently', 'surprised', 'fan', 'following', 'VERONICA', 'MARS', 'had', 'developed', 'season', '1', 'did', 'not', 'prepare', 'adequately', 'season', 'DVD', 'release', 'Thankfully', 'were', 'better', 'prepared', 'time', 'around']",N/A

Comparing the seasons leads me to rate this one a little lower, but believe me when I say this is still one of the best shows on television.Season 1 used a brilliant format. Mystery starts, plot twists along the way, cliffhangers galore, mystery solved, and another cliffhanger leaving us eagerly anticipating season 2. Possibly trying to shake things up a bit, you learn from the first few episodes of season 2 that its gonna be a busy season. The cliffhanger from last season gets wrapped a little too quickly for my liking, and opens up a whole box of new mysterys. It all leaves you slightly confused.More storylines wouldn't be a bad thing, but I found myself through the whole season expecting one to continue to build as they worked on the others, but most of the time you get a several episode delay before the other story is worked off of again. It leaves you almost forgetting what the other major plot twist was. They all wrap up by seasons end, but I was very underwhelmed when compared to last years fantastic finale.Kristen Bell continues to shine as she adds layer and layer of substance to this great character. Even if the storylines disappoint (which they do not, just a little cluttered) she could carry this show to be good anyway. The rest of the cast does an excellent job but Bell is the star of this show, and would be even if she wasn't the main character.Was this a good season? Yes. Was it as good as season 1? No. That won't stop you from enjoying this show. Within the first minute of season 2 I was smiling just seeing Bell work her wit, and I think I kept in on until the last episode. As I said there's a lot going on with this one. The characters are going through transitions, and they leave you with yet another top notch cliffhanger.

Also, we've moved past the unexplored romantic tensions between Veronica and Logan that provided so much kick to the mid-to-late parts of the first season, and are stuck instead in a bizarre love pentagon with Veronica, Logan, Meg, Duncan and Kendall.Some characters, so central to the series initially, leave for a while and sometimes come back (and sometimes, not). While the final few episodes find a spark, again, and provide worthy thrills and chills, it isn't as fulfilling or meaningful as the season that came before it.Not that this is a crime. The Second Season of Veronica Mars is still well-written, and beautifully acted by most of its regulars. The emergence of ""Beaver"" as a main character and his fledgling romance with always-endearing Mac is one of the highlights, as is the continued stunt-casting brilliance, finding roles (among others) for Kevin Smith and Joss Whedon.On the whole, Veronica Mars is one of the recent bright spots in all of television, and these episodes are no exception to that.

The only development that saddened me was the abrupt end to the romance between Veronica's dad & Wallace's mom - surely a show with such creative writers could have featured a classy break-up segment to give viewers some closure.This season's arcs were Veronica solving the mystery of the bus accident that killed the driver and several classmates and who killed Weevil's cousin.

Keith Mars, Veronica's dad, is still a private eye, but, now, he's written a New York Times bestseller (95th on the list) regarding the Lilly Kane Murder, and he's also running for Sheriff. He's hired by a prominent pro baseball player who fears he may be implicated in a serious crime. He also becomes buddies with the Neptune mayor, who, like all politicians, begin asking for favors. But never mind that. Suffice it to say, Keith Mars remains the coolest, most understanding dad ever on TV. Veronica, our wry and prickly 18-year-old heroine, seems to be a bit more content nowadays. She's survived and moved on from last year's ostracism, though she still navigates the vicious morass of teenage social politics, often finds herself embroiled in the class wars between the haves and the have-nots, and, of course, suffers thru that old reliable youthful malady: teen angst. But, now, she's got a normal gig waitressing at a restaurant and even finds time to have a romantic life every now and then. And, being Veronica Mars, she still solves cases. As usual, she is aided and abetted by her best friend Wallace (who goes thru his own set of rough times here) and Mac, the nerdy computer hack.And just because Lilly Kane's murder has been solved, and the murderer imprisoned, that doesn't mean that there isn't a season-long mystery to mull over. In fact, we are treated to two season-long mysteries, as well as further ramifications of the slaying of Lilly Kane. The first big mystery involves a school bus which careens over a cliff and kills everyone on board, most of whom were Neptune High students. Veronica is compelled to get to the bottom of this case; she had an ex-friend on that bus, and also suspects that she herself was the one targeted by the saboteur (she was supposed to be on that bus). The second mystery, which actually begins in Season One's final episode, revolves around who killed Felix, a cousin and crony member of Weevil Navarro's PCH bike gang. Throughout the season, we also witness Ms. Mars take on cases involving student athletes flunking their drug tests, pizza boy muggings, gay website blackmailing, tracking down the identity of an abused child, Wallace being framed for a hit and run, the theft of a school cash box, a missing bride-to-be, a disgruntled custodian, etc. My favorite mystery of the day may have been when Veronica goes to jury duty and enacts her own version of 12 ANGRY MEN. Add to all that the trial of Aaron Echols, which requires the testimonies of the Mars family, and you could see how full Veronica's plate is this season.The cast is great, as ever. The regulars' acting performances maintain the high standards set with last season's debut. This show has been compared to BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, DAWSON'S CREEK, and even HEATHERS in terms of its portrayal of teenage sensibilities, its showcasing of wit and charm, and the relevance of its topical issues. Charisma Carpenter (the slutty but muy caliente Kendall Casablancas) comes on board semi-regularly to further bolster the Buffy connection. Alyson Hannigan shows up now and then as Logan Echoll's flighty sister, and even Joss Whedon does a cameo. More new blood surfacing are Steve Guttenberg (Woody Goodman) and Tessa Thompson (Jackie Cook), while Kevin Smith and Lucy Lawless show up for one episode each. But the standouts continue to be Enrico Colantoni (Keith Mars), Jason Dohring (Logan Echolls), and, of course, Kristen Bell as Veronica. The relationship between Veronica and her dad (which is tested this season) continue to produce emotionally rich and satisfactory moments on television. Jason Dohring? Well, he's got that tortured, bad boy image down and he's really good with the caustic remarks, as he steadily turns biting sarcasm into an elevated artform.So, as you may have guessed, Season 2, like Season 1, is chock full of humorous one-liners and witty observations delivered with inspired dryness. I don't know if high school kids are actually this off-the-cuff funny and erudite, but I'll take it. The best line, for me, though, came from an adult, Keith Mars, who, upon photographing a potential troublemaker, warns him: ""The next time I shoot you, it won't be digitally. Unless I hit you in the finger; then, we'll have a laugh about it.""Not much to speak of with regards to special features. There are additional scenes, a gag reel, and 2 featurettes: ""A Day on the Set with Veronica Mars"" (Kristen Bell breaks down a typical shooting day) and ""Veronica Mars: Not Your Average Teen Detective."" The dvd package also comes with a booklet with episode guides.VERONICA MARS remains one of the best - and certainly one of the most addictive - shows on television and is a top fixture on my must see list. Veronica Mars, thanks to Kristen Bell's scintillating performance, is well on her way to becoming an iconic, pop culture figure. This season has the trademark plot twists and misdirections and is guaranteed to keep the viewer guessing and coming back. The final episode of this season truly CANNOT be missed. There, don't say I didn't give you a heads up.",5,"""A PONY!!""",1161475200,"10 22, 2006",2006,5375,"['****SPOILERS', 'ALERT*****So', 'here', 'VERONICA', 'MARS', 'THE', 'COMPLETE', 'SECOND', 'SEASON',

As I progressed through the season, though, there was a little cattiness and sneering amid the love.  Why?  Ah, just some small things...A coffee house?  Veronica now works in a freakin' coffee house?  It just felt like a cheesy attempt to make the show feel a little more like all the other youth dramas out there.  The development wasn't totally horrible, but we could have lived without it.Some choppiness.  Characters and situations were introduced and dropped with little or no explanation.  Why exactly did Wallace have to leave for several episodes to be with his dad if little was done with the idea?  And was there ANY explanation for Veronica's dad and Wallace's mom suddenly not seeing each other anymore?  If the explanation was there it was REALLY quick.Though still compelling, the bus crash and the ""Is Logan guilty of murder"" season-long plotlines weren't as immediately dramatic as the ""Who Killed Lilly Kane?"" plot from the previous year.  But I guess what plot arcs COULD match that great first year?Okay, enough ranting about the quibbles.  What was great about the season?  Lots of stuff.  Here's a sampling:The show was as clever as always.  I loved one episode where Veronica was suddenly acting all soap opera-ish and heartbroken over Duncan, making me yell at the screen about how the quality of the writing had suddenly dropped into the basement.  But then we learn that there was a REASON Veronica was acting like a bad piece of melodrama from ""90210"".  They got me!Once again, the creators give us credit for being smart enough to keep up.  As in season one, the solutions to the individual stand-alone episodes are quickly rattled off and not spoon fed to us.  You have to pay attention.Though I felt there was more of a ""making it up as they went along"" feel to this season, I have to admit that the exciting and well-organized last episode once again neatly wrapped things up.  If things WERE created more on the fly during the course of this season, the writers certainly brought all the strands together in the end.In the end, I guess I feel that the first season of ""Veronica Mars"" easily leaped over the wall into ""excellent show"" territory and this second season had to work a little to pull itself over that wall to get into that same territory.  Hence the four-star rating instead of the five stars I gave season one.  But four stars is still nothing to sneeze at.  In other words, bring on season three.",4,Great to get back to Neptune High for another season of dark doings,1165881600,"12 12, 2006",2006,2530,"['loved', 'first', 'season', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'ultimately', 'loved', 'season', 'two', 'as', 'well', 'progressed', 'season', 'though', 'was', 'little', 'cattiness', 'sneering', 'love', 'Why', 'Ah', 'just', 'small', 'things', 'A', 'coffee', 'house', 'Veronica', 'now', 'freakin', 'coffee', 'house', 'just', 'felt', 'cheesy', 'attempt', 'make', 'show', 'feel', 'little', 'more', 'other', 'youth', 'out', 'there', 'development', 'was', ""n't"", 'totally', 'horrible', 'could', 'have', 'lived', 'it.Some', 'choppiness', 'Characters', 'situations', 'were', 'introduced', 'dropped', 'little', 'explanation', 'Why', 'exactly', 'did', 'Wallace', 'have', 'leave', 'several', 'episodes', 'be', 'dad', 'little', 'was', 'done', 'idea', 'was', 'ANY', 'explanation', 'Veronica', 'dad', 'Wallace', 'mom', 'suddenly', 'not', 'seeing', 'other', 'anymore', 'explanation', 'was', 'was', 'REALLY', 'still', 'compelling', 'bus', 'crash', 'Is', 'Logan', 'guilty', 'murder', 'season-long', 'plotlines', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'immediately', 'dramatic', 'Who', 'Killed', 'Lilly', 'Kane', 'plot', 'previous', 'year', 'guess', 'what', 'plot', 'arcs', 'COULD', 'match', 'great', 'first', 'year', 'Okay', 'enough', 'ranting', 'quibbles', 'What', 'was', 'great', 'season', 'Lots', 'stuff', 'Here', 'sampling', 'show', 'was', 'as', 'clever', 'always', 'loved', 'one', 'episode', 'where', 'Veronica', 'was', 'suddenly', 'acting', 'soap', 'opera-ish', 'heartbroken', 'Duncan', 'making', 'yell', 'screen', 'how', 'quality', 'writing', 'had', 'suddenly', 'dropped', 'basement', 'then', 'learn', 'was', 'REASON', 'Veronica', 'was', 'acting', 'bad', 'piece', 'melodrama', '90210', 'got', 'Once', 'again', 'creators', 'give', 'credit', 'being', 'smart', 'enough', 'keep', 'up', 'season', 'one', 'solutions', 'individual', 'stand-alone', 'episodes', 'are', 'quickly', 'rattled', 'off', 'not', 'spoon', 'fed', 'have', 'pay', 'felt', 'was', 'more', 'making', 'up', 'went', 'feel', 'season', 'have', 'admit', 'exciting', 'well-organized', 'last', 'episode', 'once', 'again', 'neatly', 'wrapped', 'things', 'up', 'things', 'WERE', 'created', 'more', 'fly', 'course', 'season', 'writers', 'certainly', 'brought', 'strands', 'together', 'end.In', 'end', 'guess', 'feel', 'first', 'season', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'easily', 'leaped', 'wall', 'excellent', 'show', 'territory', 'second', 'season', 'had', 'work', 'little', 'pull', 'over', 'wall', 'get', 'same', 'territory', 'Hence', 'four-star', 'rating', 'instead', 'five', 'stars', 'gave', 'season', 'one', 'four', 'stars', 'still', 'nothing', 'sneeze', 'other', 'words', 'bring', 'season', 'three']",N/A

And still we wound up confused and bewildered by some of what we were watching, for every episode is so rich and dense the mind cannot hold all the information we needed to remember from show to show.  At first we felt stupid.  OK, I feel still stupid, but surely there has never been a TV show so packed with incident and action, not to mmention so many script pages and pages of sharp, witty, incisive dialogue.  I wonder if even leading actress Kristen Bell understands the nuances of everything she's been led through.  At first, we told ourselves that Season 2 isn't as compelling as Season 1, for it lacked the intriguing and heartbreaking circumstances which led Veronica, when first we met her at the beginning of her junior year, to be the pariah and punching bag of the whole school.  First an ""O-Niner,"" then a nothing.  And in season two, the case of the school bus tumbling into the sea didn't seem that it would mean as much of Veronica as the death of her best girlfriend, Lily Kane.Yet soon it became clear that Veronica feels just as much guilt about not being on that schoolbus on the way home from the Sharks game, as she did about not being able to save Lily from being murdered.  The school bus thing is a vivid symbol of how much Veronica, by the tyranny of class, belonged on that bus, and how she's been whoring herself out by dating first Duncan, then Logan.  ""Rich dude kryptonite,"" Dick Casablancas calls her, and the insult cuts her both ways.By the way, did the actor who plays Wallace have something else to do for the second quadrant of the season?  And the actor who plays Duncan--he also must have been filming a movie or taking a vow of celibacy in a monastery.  Cause he just disappears, which is great for Logan lovers.  Logan Echolls, the boy you love to hate, gets more and more of a chance to shine in Season Two and after awhile, you just give in.  He and Veronica seem born to be together.  When they're apart, it's like magnets being ripped out of their respective fields.Not even THE WIRE has a plot so rich and multilayered.  Minor characters from season one pop up in season two and expand their performances in exciting, sometimes comical ways.  In fact characters from other shows (e.g. Willow and Cordelia from BUFFY and ANGEL) show up on VERONICA MARS in roles that seem like Shakespearean variations on the selves they used to inhabit.  If you stick it out to the end, Season 2 has a shocking finale you will never guess beforehand, and it's one that wraps up one of the mysteries of Season One you didn't even suspect invented.  From what we hear, Season Three of VERONICA MARS, on its new hybrid network the ""CW,"" is slated to be dumbed down with smaller narrative arcs and more ""stand-alone"" episodes.

Veronica is a high school student who works for her dad who happens to be a former sheriff but now works as a private detective. The relationship between parent and child is complicated but always loving. Neither Veronica or her dad are perfect. Veronica bends the rules to achieve results that she feels are morally right. As a high school student she is shown studying for exams but her world is so much more complicated than being a student. She has to deal with her first love and how she handles that relationship. She encounters so many dramatic situations but it is how she manages to deal with her life that makes this series engrossing. The rest of the young cast are not classed solely as bratty or perfect. The supporting cast is just as complicated so that there are many surprises when a character does not act as expected but shows more depth to a response.

She was going to relax and enjoy her senior year.  In fact, she's got a boring job serving coffee.  Just your typical high schooler.Unfortunately, just when she thinks she's out, she's pulled back in.  Firstly, on again off again friend Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) is accused of killing a PCHer.  Then best friend Wallace (Percy Daggs III) is part of the group of starting athletes accused of steroid use.But worst of all is the bus crash.  After a routine field trip, the bus the kids were riding in plunges over the side of a cliff, killing all on board.  The rich kids had gotten off, so once again social status plays an issue.  But worse yet, Veronica thinks it was intended to kill her.  Was she the target or was there another sinister purpose?This show started off with a strong first season and only improved with this one.  The writing is as sharp as ever.  Not only did the season long storylines keep me guessing from start to finish, but the individual mysteries that only last one episode were full of twists and turns as well.  In addition to the great plotting, the dialog is fast moving.  Veronica's sarcasm, both in dialog and her voice over narration consistently cracks me up every week.Building on the great writing is equally strong acting.  All of the actors take the wonderful words they are given and nail it every week.  Kristen Bell receives lots of praise for her work here, and it is well deserved.  She consistently hits all the peaks and valleys the role demands, and makes it look effortless.  Equally praise worthy is Enrico Colantoni in his role as Veronica's Dad.  Their scenes together are the heart of the show, and I love watching the two of them together.While the first season set contained little in the way of extras, this one does include some.  There are 22 minutes of deleted scenes, a gag reel, and two behind the scenes featurettes.  All this is on top of wide screen picture and surround sound.  If you are a fan of this show, this set is not to be missed.And if you aren't a fan of this show, what's wrong with you?

Knowing that, the writers managed to give us even more exitement than before. You can look to other reviews for the plot details, I'm just a big VM fan who's voicing the fact that season two deserves a second look, and has more to it than meets the eye.

992580,A2KEKPMI3WQMPA,B000FL7CAK,"pancake_repairman ""pancake_repairman""","[1, 22]","I was totally looking forward to watching the second season of Veronica Mars but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. I think you really need to watch it twice to understand most of what's going on because the writing doesn't direct your attention to a lot of the things that you're supposed to take note of that become relevent later on. It's more immediately concerned with having Veronica always following dead-end leads to keep the mystery going, so by the time she actually gets on the right track you don't know what pieces of information are still relevent. Like in episode 1 when Veronica asks her dad to look up the shareholders of Boatloads Of Fun Corp, I had no idea where she got that name from or why she thought they were involved. Watching it a second time I realised that one of the athletes who was framed for drug use mentioned earlier to Veronica that the company was sueing her parents, but it didn't register as a pertinent piece of information because at the time there didn't seem to be any reason to think they were a suspect.There are also moments of lazy writing that has characters behavior serving to progress a plot point without having any internal logic. Like the part in episode 1 where the cop shows up at Veronica's door to arrest Logan like he knows Logan is there and Veronica is harbouring him. If the cop thinks Logan is guilty of murder why would he assume Logan told Veronica anything about what happened on the bridge, and why would he assume Logan would more likely be at Veronica's than have just left town or even the country?Then there's the ipod switch in episode 3. Seemingly Veronica had the ipod she gave Kendall rigged to take pictures, but there's so much there that goes unexplained, like how Kendall wouldn't have immediately realised the music on the ipod wasn't hers and chased Veronica down to get hers back before she even left the gym, or why Kendall would have the ipod out in the open all day for it to take all those pictures when she was meeting with people, rather than putting it in a bag or her pocket or something.Then there's some things that just never make sense, like in episode 5 the sheriff is trying to blackmail Jackie's dad into buying 1000 tickets to an annual fundraiser. Apprently Terrence has gambling debts, but how exactly the sheriff or cop was using this against him remains unclear. It seems like the sheriff was threatening to tell his creditors his wherabouts, but if Terrence was hiding out from his creditors in Neptune why would he make a public appearance at the baseball stadium to talk to the students? And didn't his creditor later turn out to be the owner of a local casino? So if his debts were local anyway obviously he wasn't hiding out in Neptune. Maybe the cop was threatening to arrest him for illegal gambling, but if that was that case shouldn't the cop have shown what evidence he had?The characters even seem duller this time around. Veronica's Buffyesque sarcastic lines are still in effect, but in this season she's more conservatively righteous than the first season where her moral compass seemed to allow her more freedom to get the job done. Weevil looks about 30 and the kid who plays Wallace is about the least charismatic actor to ever disgrace tv screens.If you have an explanation for any of the things I've said don't make sense, post it.",2,Please enter a title for your review,1160352000,"10 9, 2006",2006,3360,"['was', 'totally', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'second', 'season', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'think', 'really', 'need', 'watch', 'twice', 'understand', 'most', 'what', 'going', 'writing', ""n't"", 'direct', 'attention', 'lot', 'things', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'take', 'note', 'become', 'relevent', 'later', 'more', 'immediately', 'concerned', 'having', 'Veronica', 'always', 'following', 'dead-end', 'leads', 'keep', 'mystery', 'going', 'so', 'time', 'actually', 'right', 'track', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'pieces', 'information', 'are', 'still', 'relevent', 'episode', '1', 'when', 'Veronica', 'dad', 'look', 'up', 'shareholders', 'Boatloads', 'Fun', 'Corp', 'had', 'idea', 'where', 'got', 'name', 'why', 'thought', 'were', 'involved', 'Watching', 'second', 'time', 'realised', 'one', 'athletes', 'who', 'was', 'framed', 'drug', 'use', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'Veronica', 'company', 'was', 'sueing', 'parents', 'did', ""n't"", 'register', 'pertinent', 'piece', 'information', 'time', 'there', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'reason', 'think', 'were', 'suspect.There', 'are', 'also', 'moments', 'lazy', 'writing', 'characters', 'behavior', 'serving', 'progress', 'plot', 'point', 'having', 'internal', 'logic', 'part', 'episode', '1', 'where', 'cop', 'up', 'Veronica', 'door', 'arrest', 'Logan', 'Logan', 'there', 'Veronica', 'harbouring', 'cop', 'Logan', 'guilty', 'murder', 'why', 'would', 'assume', 'Logan', 'told', 'Veronica', 'anything', 'what', 'happened', 'bridge', 'why', 'would', 'assume', 'Logan', 'would', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'Veronica', 'have', 'just', 'left', 'town', 'even', 'country', 'Then', 'ipod', 'switch', 'episode', '3', 'Seemingly', 'Veronica', 'had', 'ipod', 'gave', 'Kendall', 'rigged', 'take', 'pictures', 'so', 'much', 'unexplained', 'how', 'Kendall', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'immediately', 'realised', 'music', 'ipod', 'was', ""n't"", 'hers', 'chased', 'Veronica', 'down', 'get', 'hers', 'back', 'even', 'left', 'gym', 'why', 'Kendall', 'would', 'have', 'ipod', 'out', 'open', 'day', 'take', 'pictures', 'when', 'was', 'meeting', 'people', 'rather', 'putting', 'bag', 'pocket', 'something.Then', 'things', 'just', 'never', 'make', 'sense', 'episode', '5', 'sheriff', 'trying', 'blackmail', 'Jackie', 'dad', 'buying', '1000', 'tickets', 'annual', 'fundraiser', 'Apprently', 'Terrence', 'gambling', 'debts', 'how', 'exactly', 'sheriff', 'cop', 'was', 'using', 'unclear', 'sheriff', 'was', 'threatening', 'tell', 'creditors', 'wherabouts', 'Terrence', 'was', 'hiding', 'out', 'creditors', 'Neptune', 'why', 'would', 'make', 'public', 'appearance', 'baseball', 'stadium', 'talk', 'students', 'did', ""n't"", 'creditor', 'later', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'owner', 'local', 'casino', 'So', 'debts', 'were', 'local', 'anyway', 'obviously', 'was', ""n't"", 'hiding', 'out', 'Neptune', 'Maybe', 'cop', 'was', 'threatening', 'arrest', 'illegal', 'gambling', 'was', 'case', 'should', ""n't"", 'cop', 'have', 'shown', 'what', 'evidence', 'had', 'characters', 'even', 'seem', 'duller', 'time', 'around', 'Veronica', 'Buffyesque', 'sarcastic', 'lines', 'are', 'still', 'effect', 'season', 'more', 'conservatively', 'righteous', 'first', 'season', 'where', 'moral', 'compass', 'seemed', 'allow', 'more', 'freedom', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'Weevil', '30', 'kid', 'who', 'Wallace', 'least', 'charismatic', 'actor', 'ever', 'disgrace', 'tv', 'screens.If', 'have', 'explanation', 'things', ""'ve"", 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'post']",N/A

My fianc&eacute; is getting to a big Veronica Mars fan and I really wanted to watch the second season with her.As I knew, we weren't let down. The second season is amazing. From the cameos (Kevin Smith, Joss Whedon - it was like a ""geekgasm"" for me), to the great storylines (stand-alones and season-long arcs), to the characters (Logan, even better in this season than last, Duncan, who I actually liked, Kendall (and that great scene when Allyson Hannigan and Charisma Carpenter get all bitchy with each other - it was like old Buffy times!) and even Beaver! Kristin Bell's acting is unbelievable and why she doesn't get nominated for an Emmy is beyond me!One of the best things has been to watch it with her and see her discover all the great things about the second season with her. All the twists and fantastic character moments. All the heartbreaks and laughs. God this show is amazing!A word about the DVD packaging itself: nice. It's a more tight system and the extras are packed with stuff. A lot better than the first set. Not to mention the sound and the transfer look great! Good DVD job!So, to sum it up: Veronica Mars is the best show no one but us diehard VMers are watching!

992588,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000FL7CAK,Robert Moore,"[23, 24]","NEWS UPDATE -- May 16, 2006:  Mike Ausiello of TV Guide has just posted that Rob Thomas e-mailed him that VERONICA MARS has been renewed for a third season and a full 22-episode order, that can be cut back to 13 if the ratings are low.  So get this DVD box set if you are a fan!  Lend it to friends!  Recruit new viewers!  Keep this great show alive!In its first season, VERONICA MARS established itself as one of the best new shows on TV and while it didn't attract many viewers, it nonetheless managed to gain a surprising amount of critical acclaim. First, Salon.com, in its annual salute on the best show neglected by the Emmys, awarded the Buffy (named for the most unjustly Emmy-neglected show of all time) to VERONICA MARS. Then, BUFFY's creator, Joss Whedon, wrote a review in Entertainment Weekly of the DVD release of VM. His memorable three-word summation: ""Best. Show. Ever."" Finally, at the end of 2005 a host of TV critics gave their lists of the Top Five or Top Ten or just Top shows on TV. Right there among shows like LOST and ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT was that Veronica show. And it deserved all the praise. As great as it had been in its first season, its second represented a great leap forward in the complexity of its narrative and the development of its characters.Unfortunately, what VERONICA MARS did not get was viewers. Despite the fact that pretty much the same people who would love VERONICA were those who love the mega-hit LOST, the geniuses at UPN decided to put this lovely show, which was still attempting to build an audience, against one of the highest rated shows on TV, targeted at much of the same group of people. There have been some astonishingly dumb decisions in the history of TV programming, but this definitely ranks up there. The results were predetermined: very few people watched VERONICA MARS. My two favorite shows on TV are VERONICA MARS and LOST. Weekly I was left with a dilemma. But let me confess this: after the halfway point in the season and before they moved VERONICA to Tuesdays, I found myself watching VERONICA MARS instead of LOST.Season Two largely centered around the mystery of what caused a bus crash in the very first episode, a bus crash that killed several of Veronica's classmates and a bus that Veronica would have been on except by sheer accident. Though there are a host of story arcs throughout the season, this is the central one around which the season as a whole is built. What delighted me was the wonderful complexity that evolved during the course of the year. One plausible culprit after another was introduced, one new clue after another, so that one week it seemed definite that one person was responsible for the crash, but another the following week. All the way up to the end I was concerned that perhaps things were getting too complex, but in the end things were resolved in wonderful fashion.In particular I want to praise two episodes. The finale, ""Not Pictured,"" was one of the finest season finales I have ever seen. There was a new shocker of some sort every five minutes to go with some of the most gut wrenching moments I have ever witnessed on TV. There were many moments that were almost too horrible to watch, so intense they were. The episode no only resolved the major plot arcs of Season Two, but also some unresolved ones from Season One. All in all, it was a thing of glory. I was also amazed by the episode ""Donut Run,"" in which Veronica matches wits with not only Sheriff Lamb (who is supposed to be an opening credits character in Season Three) but with two FBI agents, one of whom was portrayed by none other than Xena herself, Lucy Lawless. I indicated that I was going to keep this relatively spoiler free so I won't go into details, but I found this one of the most moving, exciting, delightful, and heart breaking episodes I've seen on TV. And it ends with a nod to its competitor in the same time slot, LOST, by ending with a close up of a note from a fortune cookie, which has just below the fortune Hurley's numbers: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. On a similar note, two of my favorite shows had nods towards one another this season. On one of the final episodes of the comic masterpiece ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, George Michael asks Maebe if she would like to go watch [BLEEP] on TV. A subtitle explains that FOX had censored the name of a show on another network about a teen female detective. A few weeks later, on the episode ""The Grapes of Graff,"" Michael Cera, who played George Michael, appeared as a college tour guide, while Alia Shawkat, who played Maebe, portrayed a girl who was raped and had her head shaved, and who Veronica helps find her rapist.VERONICA MARS is the latest in a string of shows to appear in the past ten years to present female heroes. This is no longer as novel as it once was, which is a testimony to how effective these shows have been. Although the early part of the nineties saw Dana Scully on THE X-FILES and Xena on the show of the same name, it wasn't until BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER that girl heroes really began to be accepted in a big way. Compare this to the entire prior history of TV. Prior to Dana Scully, once you tick off Emma Peel (who still stands up as one of the great female heroes of all time) and Wonder Woman and the Six Million Dollar Woman (who do not), you have pretty much exhausted the list. But after BUFFY you get Aeryn Sun on FARSCAPE, Max Guevera on DARK ANGEL, Sydney Bristow on ALIAS, and River Tam on FIREFLY and SERENITY (we actually see in the latter what she would have become on the former). These women all do the things that male heroes can do, and it is irrelevant that it is unrealistic to have women doing super empowered things. We overlook that what male heroes are just as unrealistic. It is simply a convention that we buy Superman and Batman and the Green Hornet and Caine, and merely a bias that women doing similar things were unacceptable. I cracked up reading about a female anti-feminist philosophy professor who expressed outrage that feminists might want Wendy and not Peter Pan fighting Captain Hook, as if a boy who could fly and fight a pirate were somehow more lifelike. After Buffy, Wendy was free to take on Hook.Then came Veronica. Unlike Buffy, she is not super powered. Unlike Sydney and Aeryn, she wasn't trained from earliest childhood to be a super warrior. Unlike River and Max, she isn't genetically altered. She is just a girl. What is her super power? Her wits. She does what she does simply by being smarter better than anyone else. These female heroes (I am intentionally avoiding using ""heroine,"" which I think usually is employed to indicate less of a hero than a male version) have helped alter popular imagery about what women can and cannot do. Before Buffy and Max and Veronica, maybe popular culture could promulgate myths about a woman's proper place being in the home taking care of her kids, but not now. Or, stealing the title from one of Season Two's best episodes, now ""Nobody Puts Baby in a Corner."" Veronica is the ultimate 3rd Wave Feminist.What can you say about Kristen Bell? I honestly feel she deserves an Emmy nomination for Best Actress. She is an immensely gifted individual, and she doesn't even get to employ her singing and dancing skills (her background is in musical theater) on the show. She is a very tiny girl (I've read 5'1 in more than one place), but she is able to project so marvelously that it is almost impossible to believe that she is that small. She projects, ""Tough chick."" She makes you believe that she can take on an entire motorcycle gang and somehow come out on top. Or the combined forces of a sheriff's department and the FBI. Yes, she is as cute as a button, but it is her toughness and resilience that you love about her character. No matter how many terrible things happen to Veronica, she is like a cork that just pops back to the surface. She is backed by a great supporting cast. You have to love Jason Dohring as Logan Echols, one of the more complex, hard to predict characters on TV. He is also great at delivering the one-liners the writers give him. For instance, in one episode this season Veronica, wearing her restaurant uniform, rushes to get on an elevator, only to find Logan on it (this is at one of the periods where she and Logan are fairly hostile to one another).Logan: Hi ho.Veronica (mildly shocked): What?Logan: Hi ho, its off to work we go.The show contains reams of great dialogue like that. Another supporting character I want to mention is Enrico Colantoni, who excels as Veronica's father Keith. The two exhibit a rare father-daughter chemistry and comprise one of the great such relationships on TV. One character as hard to read as Logan is Weevil, played by Francisco Capra. Though he plays the ultimate outsider, Capra is the ultimate Hollywood insider, the grandson of studio exec Frank Capra Jr. and the great grandson of Hollywood legend Frank Capra.The BUFFY connections multiplied this season. Charisma Carpenter joined the show as a frequent guest star, playing Kendall Casablancas, a gold digger who seems a lower-class Cordelia Chase. It is certain that she will be back for Season Three (that is only a mild spoiler). Alyson Hannigan returned as Logan's sister Trina. There was even a moment when Kendall and Trina had an encounter. Hosts of fans were flashing on Willow and Cordy in the Sunnydale library. Finally, Joss Whedon himself did a cameo as an obnoxiously self-important rental car manager. Whedon wasn't the only celebrity to make a cameo. Early in the season director Kevin Smith played a fast food clerk, while the lead singers for both the Dandy Warhols (who perform ""We Used to Be Friends"") and Spoon sang on karaoke night in the restaurant where Veronica works (with Britt Daniel of Spoon appropriately singing along to Elvis Costello's ""Veronica"").On May 18th the CW-the result of a merge of UPN and the WB-will announce their new schedule. Though VM's ratings were terrible, the critical raves and the quality of the show seem certain to make this magnificent show one of the flagship shows on the new network.

992622,AAEYVYQO0131X,B000FL7CAK,William Gray,"[0, 0]","Season two was a let down for me after the first season.  The stories were disjointed and ludicrous even by high school sit-com standards.  The first season was choppy, but there was a sense of theme and episode story lines felt complete if often simplistic.  I was hoping for similar if not better in the second season, but instead there was a dramatic drop off in story quality.Kristin Bell, Enrico Colantoni, and Jason Dohring continue to perform admirably.  They make this season watchable and provide the few stellar moments. But other actors turn in sketchy to downright lame performances.I found Percy Daggs' character to be much less interesting as a basketball star and would-be stud, but maybe he threatened to quit the show if they didn't let him ""grow up"".  He's okay, but just not very interesting.  Teddy (just another pretty face) Dunn turns in a weak performance as Kristin's heart throb, Duncan.The strength of the show is Veronica's wisecracking personality and her abilities as a detective.  The high school drama plotlines are necessary given the setting, but whereas the first season used the high school scenarios as a backdrop for the detective stuff, season two reverses that process.  Detective stuff takes a back seat to vapid high school melodrama that goes nowhere and makes little sense.In short, it's a disappointing sequel to the first season.  I start on season three soon, and while I hope for the best, I fear the worst.  Despite all the shortcomings of the show, I still watch because Kristin Bell is just so good.  Not because she's cute (which of course she is), but because she has a real ""star presence"" and she makes me care what's happening to her character.  If only they'd given her better scripts to work with.Too bad the producers and writers for this show didn't see Freaks and Geeks, a true masterpiece achieved in the same high school setting with similar high school dramas (minus the detective stuff).  Veronica Mars as done by the Freaks and Geeks people would have been one for the ages!",2,Some great moments but as a whole a weak effort,1397779200,"04 18, 2014",2014,2039,"['Season', 'two', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'first', 'season', 'stories', 'were', 'disjointed', 'ludicrous', 'even', 'high', 'school', 'sit-com', 'standards', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'choppy', 'there', 'was', 'sense', 'theme', 'episode', 'story', 'lines', 'felt', 'complete', 'often', 'simplistic', 'was', 'hoping', 'similar', 'not', 'better', 'second', 'season', 'instead', 'was', 'dramatic', 'drop', 'off', 'story', 'quality.Kristin', 'Bell', 'Enrico', 'Colantoni', 'Jason', 'Dohring', 'continue', 'perform', 'admirably', 'make', 'season', 'watchable', 'provide', 'few', 'stellar', 'moments', 'other', 'actors', 'turn', 'sketchy', 'downright', 'lame', 'performances.I', 'found', 'Percy', 'Daggs', 'character', 'be', 'much', 'less', 'interesting', 'basketball', 'star', 'would-be', 'stud', 'maybe', 'threatened', 'quit', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'grow', 'up', 'okay', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'Teddy', 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'Dunn', 'weak', 'performance', 'Kristin', 'heart', 'throb', 'Duncan.The', 'strength', 'show', 'Veronica', 'wisecracking', 'personality', 'abilities', 'detective', 'high', 'school', 'drama', 'plotlines', 'are', 'necessary', 'given', 'setting', 'first', 'season', 'used', 'high', 'school', 'scenarios', 'backdrop', 'detective', 'stuff', 'season', 'two', 'reverses', 'process', 'Detective', 'stuff', 'back', 'seat', 'vapid', 'high', 'school', 'melodrama', 'nowhere', 'little', 'sense.In', 'short', 'disappointing', 'sequel', 'first', 'season', 'start', 'season', 'three', 'soon', 'hope', 'best', 'fear', 'worst', 'shortcomings', 'show', 'still', 'watch', 'Kristin', 'Bell', 'just', 'so', 'good', 'Not', 'cute', 'course', 'real', 'star', 'presence', 'care', 'what', 'happening', 'character', 'only', ""'d"", 'given', 'better', 'scripts', 'work', 'with.Too', 'bad', 'producers', 'writers', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'achieved', 'same', 'high', 'school', 'setting', 'similar', 'high', 'school', 'dramas', 'detective', 'stuff', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'done', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'ages']",N/A

I suggest you rent Veronica Mars Season Two on Amazon.com on Demand, Netflix, or The Playstation Network.  If you don't care keep reading.The season picks up three months after the ending of season one when it is discovered Aaron Echolls murdered Lily Kane.  Much like the pilot episode there are a lot of flashbacks to went on during the three months after the solving of Lily's murder.  We find out Logan Echolls was the mystery person behind Veronica's door at the season one finale.  We also find out that Weevel's cousin Felix was stabbed by someone and throughout the season Logan is the assumed killer.  Another thing that season one and season two share is the big event.  Like the murder of Lily Kane which dominated season one as Veronica's huge case to crack (which actually gets wrapped up in a big way at the end of the season.)  Season Two's big event involves a school bus crash which takes the lives of seven people including Veronica's close friend Meg Manning who plays a bigger role than ever thought possible when we met her in season one.Veronica's love life gets into a Triangle ... like we didn't see that coming at the end of season one.  The two men fighting over her friends Logan Echolls and Duncan Kane.  This not being a pivitol arc I won't spend too much time with this for this reason.  It seems like filler, Veronica Mars has never been a series likeBuffy The Vampire Slayer - Collector's Set (40 discs)where the title characters' love life is so important to the seasonal arc.What is important to Season Two's arc is the addition of new characters and or characters we met back at the tail end of season one.  Dick Casablancas (the name fits his character) who doesn't go through that many changes but has a small part to the bigger picture of Season Two.  Cassidy ""Beaver"" Casablancas (Dick's younger brother) who goes through a huge character growth in Season Two and actually becomes a huge player in the end of the season.  The new mayor Woody Goodman played by Steve Guttenberg ofPolice Academy (20th Anniversary Special Edition)plays a character so different than the man most people knew from the 1980's.  Then there is Jackie Cook daughter of Neptune Shark's icon Terrence Cook who eventually becomes Wallace's on again off again girlfriend.  Her role in Season Two is very minor, who only role really was to be a love interest for Wallace.The biggest guest star of the season is probably Charisma Carpenter better know to audiences as Cordelia Chase onAngel - Seasons 1-5 30-Disc DVD Set.  In the second season she plays Dick and Cassidy's gold digging yet very fine young stepmother Kendall Casablancas a character that Charisma says is like a sexier, more evil Cordelia think of Cordelia fromAngel - Season One (Slim Set)is a little more selfish and more evil.All and all Veronica Mars Season Two left me speechless.  But unlike Season One's finale Season Two's finale almost told the audience there will be a season three.
