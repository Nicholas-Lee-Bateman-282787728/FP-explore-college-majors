Taylor's acting was OK -- she was sexy in a kind of lush, overheated way. But the rest of the acting was so-so at best.

I mean!This is such an under-rated film! I don't know why. The acting is very subtle and realistic, there isn't a whole lot of action or special effects or anything crazy going on, so I guess it's not exciting enough for modern audiences who are used to excess. I frequently hear that the acting is 'wooden' for them or that the movie is 'boring'. I could not disagree more.Elizabeth Taylor is amazing. This role done by anyone else then or now would have made the movie into just another picture. Elizabeth Taylor's acting made this a classic. I loved it!I felt like I could identify with every single character, especially Gloria. I could even identify with Ligget's wife and Steve's girlfriend.In a way the ending scene is a little anti-climatic, in the way that you kind of never know what might have happened and I didn't feel resolved in the end... but isn't that the way life is sometimes? I think the point was to leave it up to the viewer's interpretation. Which is so frustrating... but if you don't get frustrated then you weren't emotionally involved. If you didn't emotionally involved, then it wasn't a good movie.I think some of the viewers who have given this a bad rating have not seen enough of Elizabeth Taylor's films, for one, and also aren't understanding the views about women and sex at the time or how this was a provocative piece at the time in which is was made. Now we see sex sex sex sex sex all over the place and people don't care for subtle. Apparently subtle acting is &#34;wooden&#34; now, since people don't throw themselves all over the screen like actors do these days.

(""Pretty Woman"" it ain't). What could have been a crackling adaption of  John O'Hara's tragic novel is instead a trashy, dramatically uneven, clich&eacute;-riddled film with a tacked-on (and ludicrous) happy ending that completely undermines the source material. Granted, Hollywood's censors would not have allowed a really faithful adaption of O'Hara's sexually charged novel, but even with the necessary trimming it should have been better. Taylor's bittersweet performance as Gloria Wandrous is by far the best thing about the film, though most of the cast acquits themselves well, particularly Lawrence Harvey as her lover, Weston Leggett. Eddie Fisher, cast only because he was Liz`s then-husband, sleepwalks through the film. Even with its flaws, it's worth seeing once, though, because Liz is simply commanding, dominating every scene she's in. Her performance edges alarmingly close to campy overacting at times, but she always knows when to reign it in, and she gives Gloria far more depth than the dreadful script could have hoped for. For those who only know Liz from her frequent tabloid headlines, here is a chance to get to know the versatile and dynamic actress who once took Hollywood by storm (though I recommend starting with ""National Velvet""). Ironically, Liz says she hates this film, possibly due to being forced (blackmailed is more like it) into it by her contract at MGM.",3,Liz is awfully good in awfully trashy  film,1030147200,"08 24, 2002",2002,1645,"['Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Oscar-winning', 'turn', 'prostitute', 'otherwise', 'average', 'film', 'emotionally', 'troubled', 'prostitute', 'who', 'go', 'straight', 'when', 'love', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'boozy', 'lawyer', 'stuck', 'miserable', 'marriage', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'ai', ""n't"", 'What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'crackling', 'adaption', 'John', ""O'Hara"", 'tragic', 'novel', 'instead', 'trashy', 'dramatically', 'uneven', 'clich', 'eacute', '-riddled', 'film', 'tacked-on', 'ludicrous', 'happy', 'ending', 'completely', 'source', 'material', 'Granted', 'Hollywood', 'censors', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'allowed', 'really', 'faithful', 'adaption', ""O'Hara"", 'sexually', 'charged', 'novel', 'even', 'necessary', 'trimming', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Taylor', 'bittersweet', 'performance', 'Gloria', 'Wandrous', 'far', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'most', 'cast', 'well', 'particularly', 'Lawrence', 'Harvey', 'lover', 'Weston', 'Leggett', 'Eddie', 'Fisher', 'cast', 'only', 'was', 'Liz', 's', 'then-husband', 'sleepwalks', 'film', 'Even', 'flaws', 'worth', 'seeing', 'once', 'though', 'Liz', 'simply', 'commanding', 'dominating', 'scene', 'performance', 'alarmingly', 'close', 'campy', 'overacting', 'times', 'always', 'when', 'reign', 'Gloria', 'far', 'more', 'depth', 'dreadful', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'hoped', 'who', 'only', 'know', 'Liz', 'frequent', 'tabloid', 'headlines', 'here', 'chance', 'get', 'know', 'versatile', 'dynamic', 'actress', 'who', 'once', 'took', 'Hollywood', 'storm', 'recommend', 'starting', 'National', 'Velvet', 'Ironically', 'Liz', 'film', 'possibly', 'due', 'being', 'forced', 'blackmailed', 'more', 'contract', 'MGM']",Butterfield 8 VHS

This isn't American style at all but it's so specific a character study and really really ugly character at that that American audiences were attracted to the novelty of it. Is this a terrible movie or just a good solid movie about terribleness.  When I was too young to see it for the first time, I just thought it was a terrible story and what a waste of Elizabeth Taylor but now that I am older and having just watched Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds after watching the English language newsmagazine programs by German television, I recognize how well done the dialogue was for the German male characters in Basterds and I think the characterization of Lawrence Harvey character is about that - a kind of overly mannered unchecked male behavior that could only exist in an unfair and illogical society.

You would not care about these people if not for the strong performances by the two central actors who imbue their characters with qualities that are not present on the written page.  Elizabeth Taylor as few actresses in history elevates otherwise mundane material into something other than.  It's debatable whether she deserved the Oscar she won for playing Gloria Wondrous but there's no debating that she earned it.  She had me won over in the film's opening scene where she awakens in another man's bed surveying the damage after another one night stand.  Taylor outwardly was probably the most beautiful woman in the world.  Her carriage in this scene suggests dissipation and internal decay and turmoil.  Laurence Harvey's Weston Liggett is Wondrous' soulmate in the sense that he is a self-loathing Park Avenue type who married well and vents his angst through booze and indiscriminate affairs.  It's inevitable when these two get together that sparks would fly but it's questionable whether you want to call it love.  Like Taylor, Harvey imbues Liggett with enough pathos that you feel empathy for an unlikable character.  I have mixed feelings about this film because it's not a pleasant viewing experience.

As the promiscuous model that finally fell in love, Taylor was the best thing in the dated, overly melodramatic, often ridiculous movie that was adapted from the John O'Hara's novel (written in 1935). I did not read ""Butterfield 8"" but I can't believe that the author of ""Appointment in Samarra, and ""The Lockwood Concern"" wrote the stuff the cheap soap-operas are made of. Liz was big and she deserved her first Oscar but there are so many bad things about the movie - uninteresting characters, uninspired acting by the male protagonists, horrible irritating musical score - just a few of them.

Taylor ""GFT""","[51, 54]","In the normal scheme of things, lofty MGM wouldn't have touched John O'Hara's novel with a ten foot pole--but shortly before her contract was to end, MGM star Elizabeth Taylor besmirched her image by running off with Debbie Reynolds' husband Eddie Fisher.  With her reputation in shreds and one foot outside the studio gate any way, MGM decided to capitalize on the bad press by casting Taylor as BUTTERFIELD 8's bad-girl-from-hell... and then, to add insult to injury, tucked Eddie Fisher into a supporting role and cast Debbie Reynolds look-alike Susan Oliver in the role of Eddie's girl friend, who feels threatened by Liz's manhungry ways.  Liz fought the project tooth and nail, but MGM was adamant: she owed them another film, and she wasn't leaving until she made it.BUTTERFIELD 8 is the story of Gloria Wandrous (Taylor), a hard-drinking, sexed-up, bed-hopping dress model who gets her kicks by seducing and then dumping men according to whim--until she encounters an unhappily married man just as hard and disillusioned as she in Weston Liggett (Laurence Harvey.)  Although the production code was still somewhat in force, it had loosened up quite a bit since the days of NATIONAL VELVET, and while scenes stop short at the bedroom door they have plenty of sizzle while they walk up to it; moreover, every one in the film talks about sex so much you'd think it had just been invented.  Taylor is on record saying that she considers the film a piece of trash, and she swears she has never actually seen it, that she would rather die than ever see it.But something weird happened as the camera rolled.  Taylor, doubtlessly driven by her fury at having to do the movie, gives a throw-away, over-the-top performance--but perversely, this is precisely what the role requires, and her performance was successful enough to earn her an Oscar.  The supporting cast follows her lead, all of them performing in broad colors and bigger-than-life emotions, and again they too are quite successful, with Laurence Harvey and Dina Merrill (as his long suffering wife) particularly effective. Ultimately, of course, Elizabeth Taylor is quite right when she says the film is a piece of trash.  But it is the best kind of trash because it is so completely trashy: BUTTERFIELD 8 doesn't just dive into the trash pile, it wallows in it with considerable conviction.  Modern films of the same type may show more skin and more sex, but for sheer authority BUTTERFIELD 8 remains a standard against which most of them pale.

This movie dealt with a different moral code of the time and Mrs Taylor was brave to take on the issues. Understanding the underdog and making them look in a positive light from a different perspective is something Elizabeth Taylor did in her life too.

279308,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6301967690,Lawyeraau,"[11, 14]","Based upon the John O'Hara novel of the same name, this film won Elizabeth Taylor an Oscar in 1960 for Best Actress. Not bad, considering that this, her last film for MGM,  was a film in which she had not wanted to act.Ms. Taylor plays a beautiful young woman, Gloria Wandrous, with serious self-esteem problems that lead her to live of life of cheap thrills. By day a dress model, by night a bon vivant, Gloria is a professional escort gotten by dialing Butterfield 8, loving and leaving so many men that she is regarded as being nothing more than a tramp. She is outwardly a bad girl with a good girl buried inside. Her childood friend, Steve (Eddie Fisher), is supportive of her and believes that she has more to offer the world than pure, unadulterated sex, while her mother (Mildred Dunnock) is in serious denial about her daughter's escapades.When Gloria meets Weston Liggett (Laurence Harvey), an unhappily married attorney who has his own issues, she undergoes a change of heart as she falls in love with him. He, too, falls in love with her. Alas, the path of true love never seems to run smoothly. Their romance is no exception.Laurence Harvey does a good job as Liggett, a man who struggle with his pride for having married his wealthy wife, Emily (Dina Merrill), whose family has him on a golden leash . Dina Merrill is good as Emily, but her role is terribly dated. She plays it as if she were a Stepford wife, a good little wife who will patiently wait until her husband stops boozing it up and whoring around. Her scene with her mother on this very issue, in which her mother congratulates her on her wisdom, is enough to make the viewer laugh.Eddie Fisher, who was cast as Steve by means of being married to Liz Taylor, displays zero talent as an actor. In fact, so uncharismatic is he on screen that he leaves the viewer wondering what it was that Elizabeth Taylor ever saw in him in real life. Susan Oliver, who credibly plays the role of Steve's girfriend, is made up to resemble Debbie Reynolds in order to capitalize on the Hollywood scandal that saw Eddie Fisher leave his wife and children for Elizabeth Taylor. In fact, I took a double take when I first saw Ms. Oliver come on screen, so obvious was it that she was made to look like Ms. Reynolds. Talk about bottom feeding!This is a film that is a curiosity piece at best, filled with what passed at the time as sophisticated repartee. While Ms. Taylor does a decent job with the role of Gloria, the film is so dated as to be almost laughable. Still, fans of Ms. Taylor will enjoy seeing her at her most beautiful.",3,DIAL AT YOUR OWN RISK...,1026259200,"07 10, 2002",2002,2589,"['Based', 'John', ""O'Hara"", 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'film', 'won', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Oscar', '1960', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Not', 'bad', 'considering', 'last', 'film', 'MGM', 'was', 'film', 'had', 'not', 'wanted', 'act.Ms', 'Taylor', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'Gloria', 'Wandrous', 'serious', 'self-esteem', 'problems', 'lead', 'live', 'life', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'day', 'dress', 'model', 'night', 'bon', 'vivant', 'Gloria', 'professional', 'escort', 'gotten', 'dialing', 'Butterfield', '8', 'loving', 'leaving', 'so', 'many', 'men', 'regarded', 'being', 'nothing', 'more', 'tramp', 'outwardly', 'bad', 'girl', 'good', 'girl', 'buried', 'inside', 'childood', 'friend', 'Steve', 'Eddie', 'Fisher', 'supportive', 'more', 'offer', 'world', 'pure', 'unadulterated', 'sex', 'mother', 'Mildred', 'Dunnock', 'serious', 'denial', 'daughter', 'escapades.When', 'Gloria', 'Weston', 'Liggett', 'Laurence', 'Harvey', 'unhappily', 'married', 'attorney', 'who', 'own', 'issues', 'change', 'heart', 'love', 'too', 'love', 'Alas', 'path', 'true', 'love', 'never', 'run', 'smoothly', 'romance', 'exception.Laurence', 'Harvey', 'good', 'job', 'Liggett', 'man', 'who', 'pride', 'having', 'married', 'wealthy', 'wife', 'Emily', 'Dina', 'Merrill', 'family', 'golden', 'leash', 'Dina', 'Merrill', 'good', 'Emily', 'role', 'terribly', 'dated', 'were', 'Stepford', 'wife', 'good', 'little', 'wife', 'who', 'will', 'patiently', 'wait', 'husband', 'boozing', 'whoring', 'around', 'scene', 'mother', 'very', 'issue', 'mother', 'wisdom', 'enough', 'make', 'viewer', 'laugh.Eddie', 'Fisher', 'who', 'was', 'cast', 'Steve', 'means', 'being', 'married', 'Liz', 'Taylor', 'zero', 'talent', 'actor', 'fact', 'so', 'uncharismatic', 'screen', 'viewer', 'wondering', 'what', 'was', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'ever', 'saw', 'real', 'life', 'Susan', 'Oliver', 'who', 'credibly', 'role', 'Steve', 'girfriend', 'made', 'up', 'resemble', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'order', 'capitalize', 'Hollywood', 'scandal', 'saw', 'Eddie', 'Fisher', 'leave', 'wife', 'children', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'fact', 'took', 'double', 'take', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'Ms.', 'Oliver', 'come', 'screen', 'so', 'obvious', 'was', 'was', 'made', 'look', 'Ms.', 'Reynolds', 'Talk', 'bottom', 'feeding', 'film', 'curiosity', 'piece', 'best', 'filled', 'what', 'passed', 'time', 'sophisticated', 'repartee', 'Ms.', 'Taylor', 'decent', 'job', 'role', 'Gloria', 'film', 'so', 'dated', 'be', 'almost', 'laughable', 'Still', 'fans', 'Ms.', 'Taylor', 'will', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'most', 'beautiful']",Butterfield 8 VHS
279309,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,6301967690,Lee Armstrong,"[1, 2]","It may be because of Elizabeth Taylor's Oscar for this film that it remains an important work.  Taylor's performance as Gloria Wandrous is very strong as she goes from the heights of romantic bliss and peace to the depths of despair and shame.  It was a demanding role; and played to Taylor's strengths.  That the film capitalizes on her beauty is reflected in her awakening at the beginning in the film without evidence of a hangover on her face, makeup perfect and every hair in place.  The film also won an Oscar for cinematography.It is a fair criticism that the film is dated; but to expect that it wouldn't be after 50 years is unrealistic.  I love John O'Hara's work, although he wasn't regarded overly highly in literary circles, perhaps for his willingness to explore basic desires.  The hole in the screenplay comes as a communication error where Weston believes Gloria has stolen a coat.  With a bit stronger communication skill set, she could have explained her dressed was ripped and she needed to cover up.  I could imagine alternative scenarios about sending it off to the cleaners or something that would not have led to the burning conclusion.  So that aspect of the writing plays as a bit contrived.Laurence Harvey's performance as Weston Liggett was good.  At times it seems a bit stagey compared to trailblazers of the era like Marlon Brando.  But Harvey has the good looks and convincingly plays a guy with a chip on his shoulder despite his good fortune.  Of the other supporting players, Mildred Dunnock as Gloria's mother does a particularly good job as the wimpy mom whose parental permissiveness has consequences.  Eddie Fisher, Dina Merrill and Susan Oliver did strong work, but the characters are rather flat and the performances don't sparkle next to Taylor.Overall, ""Butterfield 8"" is a film well worth watching for Elizabeth Taylor's star power and acting chops.

She's being honest.  This movie is trash.  It's a joke that some people actually give it more than one star.  She knew what she was talking about.It is a moral play.  The moral is that bad girls get bad things happen to them.  The moral is that promiscuous sex is bad.  Gee.  America in 1960.  Bad girls can't get married.  The only thing for a bad girl to do is drive off a cliff and die, so keep those legs together, girls.The writing is so bad it's funny.  It is like The Seagull by Chekhov, a really bad melodrama.  A loves B.  B loves C.  Chekhov labeled The Seagull a comedy, despite its constant misery, or because of it.  Perhaps he was saying that we aren't supposed to suffer along with these characters; we are supposed to laugh our heads off at them.The writing is so bad that there were several times in the movie that I actually said the line before the actor did.  It was so obvious, that the next line would be such and such, that I said it before the actor said it.  When that happens in a movie, you know you are dealing with incompetent writers.One of the funniest things about this garbage is the acting of Eddie Fisher.  He disappears in the role.  He is simply not on screen.  His voice is so soft, and he has absolutely no stage presence.  He is the opposite of an actor.  His performance has the opposite of charisma.  Putting him next to an actor is like putting matter against anti-matter.  I'm surprised that he and Liz didn't explode and obliterate each other, because her stage presence is so strong and his is nonexistant.They feed you the old garbage about a poor husband complaining that his wife is too rich and that his wife's family got him a job.  Oh poor thing.  He must escape his marriage and find some pride.  What planet is this on?  That old stupid cliche.  Hey, idiot, why don't you find some pride working in a car lot, or driving a cab, instead of accepting a responsible position taking advantage of an opportunity that your mother in law set up for you.  What idiocy.  The old bull, re-wrapped again.Nothing about the writing of this trash is original.  It is just 1960 America showing off its cliches.  There are no real people in this movie.  It is utter garbage, and anyone who is impressed by it has no taste at all.  I totally agree with Liz.  Just goes to show that you can package any old trash and find some people to rave about it.She did the movie to fulfill a contract obligation, so she could be freed up to do Cleopatra.  She always hated this trash.

Later, they embark on a hot romance which ends tragically, but not before Liz gets to wear some gorgeous outfits and have a few scenes with Eddie Fisher, her real-life boyfriend at the time, cast as her platonic friend.

But that's okay: this is one of those &quot;torn from today's headlines&quot; kind of movie where things like that are commonplace. Liz plays Gloria Wandruss, a wild sex kitten who  may or may not be a call girl. I mean, why is the movie named after a phone number otherwise? Yet Liz gets steamed when Laurence Harvy leaves her money after their night together, so steamed that she uses her lipstick to scrawl across the living room mirror, &quot;No Sale!&quot; Wow, is this trash or what?  Yes, &quot;Butterfield 8&quot; is a type of trash movie, in spite of its garnering Liz an Oscar. Why trash? There's a lot of meaningless sexy talk between everyone imaginable, for one thing. Another thing is the terrible acting of Laurence Harvey--he comes across as a sicko and I'm not sure that's where they were going with this one. He has the requisite long-suffering wife, Dina Merrill; not much to say about her performance--she knows that for some reason he's troubled, but she expects him to find himself one day.  Really bad too is Liz's real-life husband of the year, Eddie Fisher, as her childhood friend who may or may not be in love with her. She keeps going over to his apartment and annoying him as he tries to compose music at his piano. From time to time his angry girlfriend Susan Oliver stops in to say jealousy-tinged things to Liz. I couldn't help but notice that Susan Oliver's hair and clothing style are suspiciously familiar--hey, she looks like Debbie Reynolds!  I wonder why.  I understand the original book by John O'Hara has the sexy Gloria leave her lover's apartment wearing nothing but a mink coat she &quot;borrows&quot; from his wife's closet, because during their wild night he ripped her dress off her body.  Well, Hollywood allowed us to see the ripped dress on the floor, but Liz traipses around Laurence Harvey's apartment in her tight tight slip and spike heels before heading out under the mink. What I'd like to know is, If he was so passionate that he ripped her dress, why is this tight slip intact? Seems to me that something that form hugging would have offered more protection than a chastity belt.  &quot;Butterfield 8&quot; is not a fine film, but it does offer us much in the way of humor, however inadvertently.

279315,A22TQMQ4TQGW43,6301967690,Marcco99,"[8, 8]","This is my favorite Elizabeth Taylor performance.Writer Paul Monette refers to this film as being one in a 'trilogy' of bad girl roles for Elizabeth Taylor--the other two being ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof""(1958) and ""Suddenly,Last Summer""(1959). These three films should be in every DVD collection. Certainly they present Taylor at her absolute physical peak, but they also show the dark side of her sexuality, which is quite riveting.Taylor loves to refer to this movie as ""trash"", even though she won an Oscar for the role. Maybe she felt she was being exploited by the studio with this film's content  due to her highly publicized love affairs at the time. However, SEX SELLS, and as a beautiful, voluptuous, and semi-amoral model, Taylor has never been better. She simply smoulders in this film, especially in the 'morning after' scenes in the beginning. Taylor in her tight slip, drink in hand, is now an iconic Hollywood image. Also, she and Laurence Harvey make a VERY HOT team, SCORCHING, something we've never seen with Taylor and Richard Burton.There's one scene in the film, in a nightclub, where Taylor and Harvey are at a table... and although Taylor is approached by a number of admirers, she continually looks over at Harvey, plays with her pearls, and smiles so shyly, SOOOO sweetly at him...a beautiful, glowing moment.Contrast that with their final meeting in a diner: Harvey suprises Taylor there, and the frozen look of shock & awe on her face! Another wonderful moment...interestingly, this film is FILLED with many wonderful moments from Elizabeth the actor. She has many difficult scenes to play with no dialog--- she begins AND ends the film in long scenes with very little dialog--- yet she has created here a believable, complex 'sixties' heroine.The movie is really a TAYLOR STAR VECHICLE, it's all about HER, with a great leading man, and some excellent supporting players. A great showcase.  And Elizabeth does do some good acting, very moving in the confession scene and in her last scene with Harvey as she tries to escape him. Her acting here is certainly Oscar-worthy to me.Also interesting is the fact that this may be the first American film to link child molestation with promiscuity, or even talk about such subjects. Remember this was made in 1960.For me this film is part of another trilogy... one of three Best Actress Oscar-winning roles of women gambling with their sexuality to find happiness, with each one losing--- Elizabeth here, Simone Signoret in ""Room at the Top"" (1959), and Julie Christie in ""Darling"" (1965)... and Laurence Harvey was in all THREE films!!",4,Taylor at her Sexiest,1138579200,"01 30, 2006",2006,2603,"['favorite', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'performance.Writer', 'Paul', 'Monette', 'refers', 'film', 'being', 'one', ""'trilogy"", 'bad', 'girl', 'roles', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'other', 'two', 'being', 'Cat', 'Hot', 'Tin', 'Roof', '1958', 'Suddenly', 'Last', 'Summer', '1959', 'three', 'films', 'should', 'be', 'DVD', 'collection', 'Certainly', 'present', 'Taylor', 'absolute', 'physical', 'peak', 'also', 'show', 'dark', 'side', 'sexuality', 'quite', 'riveting.Taylor', 'loves', 'refer', 'movie', 'trash', 'even', 'won', 'Oscar', 'role', 'Maybe', 'felt', 'was', 'being', 'exploited', 'studio', 'film', 'content', 'due', 'highly', 'publicized', 'love', 'affairs', 'time', 'However', 'SEX', 'SELLS', 'beautiful', 'voluptuous', 'semi-amoral', 'model', 'Taylor', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'simply', 'smoulders', 'film', 'especially', ""'morning"", 'scenes', 'beginning', 'Taylor', 'tight', 'slip', 'drink', 'hand', 'now', 'iconic', 'Hollywood', 'image', 'Also', 'Laurence', 'Harvey', 'make', 'VERY', 'HOT', 'team', 'SCORCHING', 'something', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Taylor', 'Richard', 'Burton.There', 'one', 'scene', 'film', 'nightclub', 'where', 'Taylor', 'Harvey', 'are', 'table', 'Taylor', 'approached', 'number', 'admirers', 'continually', 'over', 'Harvey', 'pearls', 'smiles', 'so', 'shyly', 'SOOOO', 'sweetly', 'beautiful', 'glowing', 'moment.Contrast', 'final', 'meeting', 'diner', 'Harvey', 'Taylor', 'there', 'frozen', 'look', 'shock', 'awe', 'face', 'wonderful', 'moment', 'interestingly', 'film', 'FILLED', 'many', 'wonderful', 'moments', 'Elizabeth', 'actor', 'many', 'difficult', 'scenes', 'play', 'dialog', 'film', 'long', 'scenes', 'very', 'little', 'dialog', 'yet', 'created', 'here', 'believable', 'complex', ""'sixties"", 'heroine.The', 'movie', 'really', 'TAYLOR', 'STAR', 'VECHICLE', 'HER', 'great', 'leading', 'man', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'players', 'great', 'showcase', 'Elizabeth', 'do', 'good', 'acting', 'very', 'moving', 'confession', 'scene', 'last', 'scene', 'Harvey', 'escape', 'acting', 'here', 'certainly', 'Oscar-worthy', 'me.Also', 'interesting', 'fact', 'may', 'be', 'first', 'American', 'film', 'link', 'child', 'molestation', 'promiscuity', 'even', 'talk', 'such', 'subjects', 'Remember', 'was', 'made', '1960.For', 'film', 'part', 'trilogy', 'one', 'three', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar-winning', 'roles', 'women', 'gambling', 'sexuality', 'find', 'happiness', 'one', 'losing', 'Elizabeth', 'here', 'Simone', 'Signoret', 'Room', 'Top', '1959', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'Darling', '1965', 'Laurence', 'Harvey', 'was', 'THREE', 'films']",Butterfield 8 VHS

Taylor and Lawrence Harvey were A* in their performances.  Elizabeth was really riveting, especially since, SUDDENLY, LAST SUMMER, her last film, at that time(1959). Betty Field, Mildred Dunnick and Dina Merrill were excellent as supporting Elizabeth's acting, but the true surprise was EDDIE FISHER!

279318,ATZONTF6SUZEP,6301967690,Matthew Patton,"[2, 2]","The first few minutes are the best; icy strings and saxophones and Liz Taylor waking up in what is obviously a strange bed.  She crawls out, dons a slip, brushes her teeth with bourbon and takes a tour of her pick-up's Park Avenue digs.  It doesn't quite match the combination of doom and sour comedy with which John O'Hara began the novel of the same title, but it gets close.  And as in the book, Taylor, as Gloria Wandrous, steals a mink coat and heads home.And then everything goes wrong.  O'Hara's novel was a bit trashy at times, but it was in no way a soap opera.  The script, by Charles Schnee and John Michael Hayes, all but drowns in suds and overwrought dialogue.  Taylor, although really too old to be playing Gloria, got at the character's wit and self-destructive streak and even made some of the god-awful talk compelling.  As Weston Liggett, the human sewage who helps to send Gloria to her doom, Laurence Harvey is very good as long as he's being rotten and predatory; he tries manfully to convince us that Liggett has some sort of humanity benath his tailored scales, but fails.  And Dina Merrill isn't even given a chance to play his pathetic wife, who in the book is tied by emotional needs and sexual attraction to a man she knows is destroying her bit by bit.  She changes shirtwaists every few scenes and smiles through her tears.  Eddie Fisher does what he can with the role of Gloria's platonic friend, who narrates the book in flashback, and he's actually not all that bad, just sort of irrelevant in this version of things.  One could also talk about the film's absurd ending and the attempt to elevate the ghastly Wandrous-Liggett liaison to a tale of doomed and forbidden love, but it's sheer waste of breath, as would be any words about Daniel Mann's mostly non-existant direction--he made sure the actors hit their marks and let the crew do the rest.The crew knew what they were doing; Joseph Ruttenburg did nice location photography in New York and lit the interiors to within an inch of their life.  Helen Rose made Taylor look gorgeous and Dina Merrill appropriately WASPy.

So trumpeted the posters of this, Elizabeth Taylor's first Oscar winning performance. The film is a modernization of the 1935 novel by John O'Hara, which was based on the real life of the 1920's New York City call girl Starr Faithful.Miss Taylor was dead set against playing Gloria Wandrous. She felt was a deliberate play by M.G.M. to capitalize on her recent notoriety in the Liz-Eddie-Debbie scandal. Also, she was anxious to move on to her first ever million-dollar role in Fox's Cleopatra. She was told by M.G.M that if she did not fulfill her contractual obligation to her home studio for one final film on her eighteen year contract that she would be kept off the screen for two years and miss making Cleopatra all together. She swore to the producer Pandro S. Berman that she would not learn her lines, not be prepared and in fact not give anything more and a walk through. Mr. Berman knew her better than she suspected. In the end Elizabeth Taylor turned in a professional, classic old style Hollywood performance that ranks at the top with the best of her work. She brings a savage rage to live to her searing portrait of a lost girl soaked through with sex and gin. A woman hoping against all hope to find salvation in yet one last man. Weston Leggett, a man who is worse off than she is in the self-esteem department. In her frantic quest for a clean new life Gloria finds that the male establishment will not allow her to step out of her role as a high priced party girl. She is pigeon holed by her past and the narrow mores of the late 50's are not about to let her fly free. Not the bar-buzzards of Wall Street, not her best friend Steve who abandons her at his girlfriend's insistence. Not even her shrink Dr. Treadman believes in her. The three women in her life are blind to who she really is. Her mother will not admit what Gloria has become. Mrs. Thurber will not believe she can ever change and Happy, the motel proprietor is too self involved in her own past to care who Gloria is She is the dark Holly Golightly and this is the lurid red jelled Metro-Color Manhattan that is the flip side of Billy Wilder's The Apartment (also 1960). Wilder's New York is cynical. Liz's tony East Side phone exchange rings only one way, the hard way. This New York is dammed. The film concludes in a melodramatic blaze that Douglas Sirk might have envied in place of his usually unsettling, unconvincing happy endings. In the end we have a bravura performance by the last true star of the old system. Yes she deserved the Oscar more for `Cat'. Yes it was given to welcome her back from the brink of death in London. And even Shirley MacLaine's lament on Oscar night, `I lost the Oscar to a tracheotomy.' can not diminish this must see performance by Miss Taylor.In what one could call a perfect example of what an `Oscar scene' is all about she says it all. `I loved it! Every awful moment of it I loved. That's your Gloria, Steve. That's your precious Gloria!'

Elizabeth Taylor plays Gloria, a booze-guzzling, ... promiscuous young woman who becomes involved with an unhappily married businessman (Laurence Harvey). The opening scenes well establish the film's vibe: the story is saturated with cigarettes, alcohol, money, expensive fur, sex, and fury.That said, I found B8 to be a wonderfully entertaining and surprisingly moving film. The delicious dialogue is full of memorable lines (like the one I used for the title of this review). The characters zap each other with some biting insults. A typical exchange between two characters: ""Oh mother, don't be vulgar."" Response: ""Vulgarity has its uses.""The entire cast is solid, but this is undeniably Taylor's film. She takes what could have been a campy caricature and instead gives Gloria real depth and humanity. By the end of the film I was really engrossed in Gloria's personal journey.

No one could deny that nature gifted her in many ways, even giving her a compassionate heart. Although much has been said and written about her destructive living (in real life), it is also well known that when she was a friend, she was truly a genuine friend. She loved deeply and passionately, but was much more than a ""thing"" of beauty and decoration. Her acting spoke for itself, although many have allowed her beauty to overshadow her ability to say much even with a few words. It is interesting, too, to observe her fullness of figure, and compare that to today's actresses who want total firmness in arms, legs, shoulders -- Elizabeth's figure was real, and to me (an old man) it spoke volumes in sexuality and splendor not equalled today. I was quite saddened to see the last images of her shortly before her death, but it was obvious that age had taken hold -- as is the course of nature. She herself said that she never liked to watch herself on film and did not like her voice or anything about herself. We are much the richer, however, that others did. I think, though, that she was truly a sad individual. I always wanted to say something to her, but was never allowed that opportunity. She always struck me as someone who needed just an understanding touch of one's hand, to make her know that she was not really unlike so many more who are imperfect but still adored.

I wanted to see what Elizabeth Taylor won an Oscar for and she does deliver as kind of a Holly Golightly gone darkly tragic.  The great part of her character is that she's somewhere between a prostitute and a mistress and she doesn't let anyone else define the line for her.  That was nice.  It would've been easy to make her the prostitute with the heart of gold but it was more interestign to have Eddie Fisher as her best friend/unrequited lover and a Debbie Reynolds lookalike as his fiancee who is disgusted with his relationship with her.There was some criticism of Fisher's part in the film, him not being the super actor that everyone else in the film is, I disagreed.  The dark irony of them playing out their real life affair in the film, packing movei houses I'm sure and also his lack of sophistication, his lack of dazzle to interest her as anything but a safe space was really a nice twist on their real life relationship.I hail Virginia Wolf as one of the best films of all time but this one has a nice dark humor to it and Taylor is strog as a woman who is literally chased by her life to the ends of her life.Prostitutes and dying at the end, along with disabilities was a shoe in for winning Oscars for awhile, even though Taylor comes off as immoral.  And by the time she decides to reveal herself as a caring person circumstance destroys her shakey reputation and eventually even her psyche.Her lover, who decides to leave his diletante lifestyle comes off as insanely intense and Taylor does a nice turn as going from shark to being sympathetic as she's pushed to the edge of love and identity.",4,A fun film,1047254400,"03 10, 2003",2003,1685,"['bought', 'film', 'so', 'liked', 'Who', 'Afraid', 'Virginia', 'Wolf', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'won', 'Oscar', 'deliver', 'kind', 'Holly', 'Golightly', 'gone', 'darkly', 'tragic', 'great', 'part', 'character', 'somewhere', 'prostitute', 'mistress', ""n't"", 'let', 'anyone', 'else', 'line', 'was', 'nice', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'easy', 'make', 'prostitute', 'heart', 'gold', 'was', 'more', 'interestign', 'have', 'Eddie', 'Fisher', 'best', 'friend/unrequited', 'lover', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'lookalike', 'fiancee', 'who', 'disgusted', 'relationship', 'her.There', 'was', 'criticism', 'Fisher', 'part', 'film', 'not', 'being', 'super', 'actor', 'everyone', 'else', 'film', 'disagreed', 'dark', 'irony', 'playing', 'out', 'real', 'life', 'affair', 'film', 'packing', 'movei', 'houses', ""'m"", 'sure', 'also', 'lack', 'sophistication', 'lack', 'dazzle', 'interest', 'anything', 'safe', 'space', 'was', 'really', 'nice', 'twist', 'real', 'life', 'relationship.I', 'hail', 'Virginia', 'Wolf', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'time', 'one', 'nice', 'dark', 'humor', 'Taylor', 'strog', 'woman', 'who', 'literally', 'chased', 'life', 'ends', 'life.Prostitutes', 'dying', 'end', 'disabilities', 'was', 'shoe', 'winning', 'Oscars', 'awhile', 'even', 'Taylor', 'off', 'immoral', 'time', 'reveal', 'caring', 'person', 'circumstance', 'shakey', 'reputation', 'eventually', 'even', 'psyche.Her', 'lover', 'who', 'leave', 'diletante', 'lifestyle', 'off', 'insanely', 'intense', 'Taylor', 'nice', 'turn', 'going', 'shark', 'being', 'sympathetic', 'pushed', 'edge', 'love', 'identity']",Butterfield 8 VHS

Most actresses would enjoy the chance to play a B-girl, but Liz never coveted the showy roles, she never played whores or drunks or nuns or aspiring actresses... Her audience wanted to see her in sensational roles, but she preferred being proper...Rewritten, the edge taken off, John O'Hara's Gloria Wandrous emerges somewhat undefined... The movie is so cautious that it's never clear exactly how the girl makes her living... She models, apparently, but does she get paid for sleeping with men, or does she sleep with men simply because she likes to?At the height of a family argument, Gloria confesses to her mother that she was the slut of all time, but there is no evidence of this on screen... As in ""The Last Time I Saw Paris,"" Liz--as girl-about-town--is pallid, almost prissy... She doesn't have the freedom to portray amoral characters... She doesn't have the manic self-destructiveness the part requires... The script makes the character another of Taylor's tragic roles: Gloria Wandrous is a woman, mistreated by her man, who dies of unrequited love...Like the conception of its heroine, the movie is infected with an enervating morality: once a sinner, the message goes, always a sinner... Deep down, this MGM Gloria feels that her indelible history of nights on the town has disqualified her for the likes of a respectable man... Self-convicted as a bad girl, she knows she's doomed... Much more than the novel, the film emphasizes Gloria's lust for respectability... Weston Liggett (Laurence Harvey), the wealthy Yale man, is her one big chance for graduation to the classy life of yachts and weekends in the country... It's as if the character wants to enter the world a younger Taylor so ably embodied in ""A Place in the Sun."" O'Hara's tough, precise, lovingly detailed novel has been transformed into Metro soap, a lament about a sort of hooker with a persistent desire for suburbia...But there are moments: the wordless opening scene, Gloria stained and rumpled after a night with Liggett; Gloria trading cracks with her mother's sardonic friend, and with her best friend's girlfriend; Gloria convulsed in tears during an argument with her meek mother (Mildred Dunnock).Taylor and Laurence Harvey mix like oil and water, but her scenes with Eddie Fisher, who plays her platonic, disapproving buddy are strongly build... Eddie gives her quiet support, the way Montgomery Clift always gave her strength on screen...Her big scene is her confession to Eddie about how she got started in the life: she was seduced by a house guest when she was thirteen, and she liked it (very wide-eyed, very high-pitched and piercing here), she has always 'liked' it! The confession scene is a Taylor trademark during this period: in ""Raintree County,"" ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,"" ""Suddenly, Last Summer,"" and here, confessions dramatically lit and photographed are the local points of her performances...Liz gets the character's self-pity, her sentimentality, her loneliness; she can do the smart answers, the head lifted in defiance... She plays, in short, with an authority that had deepened since ""Giant.""

279336,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6301967690,Simon Davis,"[11, 12]","Despite the thoughts of some critics and indeed Elizabeth Taylor herself at times about this film, I've always admired it and firmly believe it is an unfairly maligned production with many interesting elements. It really represents the last breath of old style Hollywood moviemaking at MGM, a studio famed for displaying its female stars to best advantage in glossy productions. In my belief Elizabeth Taylor delivers good work as high class call girl Gloria Wanderous who despite being in her own words ""The slut of all time"", actually reeks sophistication and a rare beauty not seen in movies nowadays. Even in decline MGM was still capable of surrounding their star with the best in supporting players, costumes and opulent settings,which helped make ""Butterfield 8"", their biggest grossing film for 1960.""Butterfield 8"" stands for the telephone answering service used by Gloria's ""customers"" when they want her services. Supposedly working as a model and ""hostess"", or so her trusting mother (Mildred Dunnock) would like to believe, Gloria is actually a high class prostitute catering to bored and wealthy married men. One such man Weston Liggett (Laurence Harvey) comes into her life and for the first time Gloria finds herself falling in love with a client who previously would have been one of the faceless men she encounters in her work. Liggett has married into an old money background and Gloria is made very aware of her real status  when after an all night lovemaking session Weston leaves her money for her ""troubles"" beginning for Gloria a downward spiral to a tragic ending. Along the way we see the other parts of Gloria's shabby life from best friend Steve (Taylor's real life husband Eddie Fisher), who is like an older protective brother and who has a disapproving girlfriend  Norma (Susan Oliver). Norma resents Gloria's continued intrusions into their lives and sees her as a threat to their future happiness together. Gloria travels a rocky road in her relationship with Weston as he married his aristocratic wife Emily (Dina Merrill) solely for the money and position that came with it. Emily plays the patient wife who looks the other way in regard to his infidelities and she realises that Weston is having an affair when one of her Mink Coats is taken by Gloria after she spends a night in the apartment with Weston. Seeing that Weston will never be able to break away from the grip of Emily's family and his ties to her money, Gloria tries to break off the romance and leaves to begin a new life in Boston. Weston however finds he cannot overcome his passion for her and goes off in pursuit where after an aborted chase Gloria wrecks her car and is killed on an unmade freeway. Weston then returns to his dull life that he knew before the excitment of the girl at ""Butterfield 8"".Passed off as sensationalist magazine fiction, ""Butterfield 8"", was in fact based on a novel by John O'Hara that created a few sparks itself due to it's ""illicit"" subject matter. Elizabeth Taylor was highly resistant to playing the role of Gloria despite it being the last film in her long running contract with MGM. It was responsible for holding her up from accepting the lead role in ""Cleopatra"" being planned by Twentieth Century Fox for which she was being paid a record One Million dollars. Also she felt that the studio was unfairly trying to cash in on her recent notoriety surrounding her controversial marriage to Eddie Fisher. Despite her clashes with director Daniel Mann Elizabeth I believe has rarely been more exciting on screen and turns in a multi layered performance that has elements of glamour, tragedy and passion. Rarely has she looked more beautiful in a film and the often elaborate settings play up the glamourous side of the story that reeks old Hollywood. Laurence Harvey registers well as the bored man facing the crisis of his life over whether to follow his heart or stay in his ""safe"" zone. He has a great chemistry with Elizabeth Taylor and would be reteam with her 13 years later in the excellent, seldom seen thriller ""Night Watch"". Eddie Fisher is the one weak link in the story as Gloria's friend Steve. In a role originally intended for David Janssen, Fisher reveals his lack of real acting talent however Susan Oliver as girlfriend Norma excels in her few scenes, in particular in her catty exchanges with Gloria which are among the most meaty in the story. Another standout is Kay Medford in a heartbreaking performance as the sad ""seen it all"" owner of the seedy motel where Weston and Gloria often have their rendezvous.""Butterfield 8"", is real old style filmmaking with a production full of beautiful clothes, lush settings with well heeled people emeshed in heartbreaking situations. The moralistic tone of the early sixties demanded that ""bad girl"", Gloria ultimately pay for her sins but this doesn't detract from the films great entertainment value. Should Elizabeth Taylor have won the 1960 Best Actress Oscar? It's open to debate however I for one admire her performance here greatly and it undoubtedly shows Taylor in all her movie queen splendour. Beginning a decade where her main leading man would repeatedly be Richard Burton, her teaming with Laurence Harvey is an interesting one that works well.

279337,A14HHOT9999Z22,6301967690,"Stephen M. Moser ""The Austin Chronicle""","[16, 17]","""She's catnip to every cat in town,"" a bartender says of Gloria Wandrous, call girl and Party Girl #1, who is boozing it up, surrounded by a dozen men. Waking up in Wes Liggett's Fifth Avenue penthouse, she discovers he's left her a wad of money and a note saying, ""Is $250 enough?"" She hurls the money away, scrawling ""No Sale"" on the mirror with her lipstick. But she seems to forget that she is a call girl, and call girls accept money for services rendered. Unfortunately, Gloria is in love with Liggett, her ""john"", but he is married to someone else - a society matron poorly played by the cold, patrician beauty, Dina Merrill. As Gloria is leaving, she steals Ligget's wife's $7000 fur coat and starts all kinds of trouble. It certainly would have caused trouble today - the entire film is a PETA nightmare, as Gloria can be clocked wearing suede, lynx, coyote, mink, sable, beaver, and something that looks like skunk. The whole movie has Liz in her last fading bloom of youth, girded-to-the-gills and at the peak of her ""eyebrows-of-death"" period. Her Gloria-ously voluptuous figure is beginning to bulge and sag, but she is decked out to the nines in drop-dead stylish early-60s glamour. At the time, Liz and Jackie Kennedy were neck-and-neck in the glamour department, and the Jackie look is unmistakably present in Liz's styling. Though Jackie's never would be, Liz's cleavage is on abundant display. Cleavage was such a powerful metaphor for sex, then - a set-piece whose effectiveness would be impossible now (you practically have to show actors rutting on the floor to satisfy the modern taste). Liz was also at the peak of her Eddie Fisher period - playing a harlot on screen after stealing Fisher away from his real-life wife, Debbie Reynolds, only added to Liz's plummeting reputation. Fisher plays Gloria's friend who loves her but is not taken seriously by her. He's such a drip onscreen, that you can't help wondering how in real life this guy managed to attract one of the most glamorous women in the world. The suave and very continental Harvey is equally dull, especially as he commandeers that last 20 minutes of the film.The part of Gloria won an Oscar for Liz Taylor - mysteriously, since the work is far inferior to many of Liz's previous films. Liz has proclaimed that this is the least favorite film she ever made - she was simply fulfilling the requirements of her contract. But when Liz is good, she's very, very good, but when she's bad, she gives it all she's got. Director Daniel Mann definitely had a way with leading-ladies. In addition to guiding Liz towards her Oscar, he did the same for Shirley Booth in *Come Back, Little Sheba* and Anna Magnani in *The Rose Tattoo*. Also directing Susan Hayward in *I'll Cry Tomorrow*, Mann certainly excels in these heavy-handed soapers. Based on the racy John O'Hara novel, the dialogue is dreadful. At one point Gloria tells her shrink, ""I don't need you any more. I have no problems. I'm in love,"" as well as, ""Someday Wes is going to find himself, and I want to be there.""  The script was so bad my sister and I veered off into a conversation about the Austin yogurt shop murders, and missed a scene full of lots of drinking, ultimatums and arched eyebrows, but we were riveted to the screen as Gloria is screaming, ""Mama, face it! I was the slut of all time!"" But even when shrieking, Liz is irresistible. And like Gloria says in the movie, ""I loved it - every awful moment of it, I loved!""",3,"""I loved it - every awful moment of it, I loved!""",1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,3472,"['catnip', 'cat', 'town', 'bartender', 'Gloria', 'Wandrous', 'call', 'girl', 'Party', 'Girl', '1', 'who', 'boozing', 'up', 'surrounded', 'dozen', 'men', 'Waking', 'up', 'Wes', 'Liggett', 'Fifth', 'Avenue', 'penthouse', 'left', 'wad', 'money', 'note', 'saying', '250', 'enough', 'hurls', 'money', 'away', 'scrawling', 'Sale', 'mirror', 'lipstick', 'forget', 'call', 'girl', 'call', 'girls', 'accept', 'money', 'services', 'rendered', 'Unfortunately', 'Gloria', 'love', 'Liggett', 'john', 'married', 'someone', 'else', 'society', 'matron', 'poorly', 'played', 'cold', 'patrician', 'beauty', 'Dina', 'Merrill', 'Gloria', 'leaving', 'Ligget', 'wife', '7000', 'fur', 'coat', 'kinds', 'trouble', 'certainly', 'would', 'have', 'caused', 'trouble', 'today', 'entire', 'film', 'PETA', 'nightmare', 'Gloria', 'can', 'be', 'clocked', 'wearing', 'suede', 'lynx', 'coyote', 'mink', 'sable', 'beaver', 'something', 'skunk', 'whole', 'movie', 'Liz', 'last', 'fading', 'bloom', 'youth', 'girded-to-the-gills', 'peak', 'eyebrows-of-death', 'period', 'Gloria-ously', 'voluptuous', 'figure', 'beginning', 'bulge', 'sag', 'decked', 'nines', 'drop-dead', 'stylish', 'early-60s', 'glamour', 'time', 'Liz', 'Jackie', 'Kennedy', 'were', 'neck-and-neck', 'glamour', 'department', 'Jackie', 'look', 'unmistakably', 'present', 'Liz', 'styling', 'Jackie', 'never', 'would', 'be', 'Liz', 'cleavage', 'abundant', 'display', 'Cleavage', 'was', 'such', 'powerful', 'metaphor', 'sex', 'then', 'set-piece', 'effectiveness', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'now', 'practically', 'have', 'show', 'actors', 'rutting', 'floor', 'satisfy', 'modern', 'taste', 'Liz', 'was', 'also', 'peak', 'Eddie', 'Fisher', 'period', 'playing', 'harlot', 'screen', 'stealing', 'Fisher', 'away', 'real-life', 'wife', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'only', 'added', 'Liz', 'plummeting', 'reputation', 'Fisher', 'Gloria', 'friend', 'who', 'not', 'taken', 'seriously', 'such', 'drip', 'onscreen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wondering', 'how', 'real', 'life', 'guy', 'managed', 'attract', 'one', 'most', 'glamorous', 'women', 'world', 'suave', 'very', 'continental', 'Harvey', 'equally', 'dull', 'especially', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'film.The', 'part', 'Gloria', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Liz', 'Taylor', 'mysteriously', 'work', 'far', 'inferior', 'many', 'Liz', 'previous', 'films', 'Liz', 'proclaimed', 'least', 'favorite', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'was', 'simply', 'fulfilling', 'requirements', 'contract', 'when', 'Liz', 'good', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'when', 'bad', 'got', 'Director', 'Daniel', 'Mann', 'definitely', 'had', 'way', 'leading-ladies', 'addition', 'guiding', 'Liz', 'Oscar', 'did', 'same', 'Shirley', 'Booth', '*Come', 'Back', 'Little', 'Sheba*', 'Anna', 'Magnani', '*The', 'Rose', 'Tattoo*', 'Also', 'directing', 'Susan', 'Hayward', '*I', ""'ll"", 'Cry', 'Tomorrow*', 'Mann', 'certainly', 'heavy-handed', 'soapers', 'Based', 'racy', 'John', ""O'Hara"", 'novel', 'dialogue', 'dreadful', 'one', 'point', 'Gloria', 'shrink', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'more', 'have', 'problems', ""'m"", 'love', 'as', 'well', 'Someday', 'Wes', 'going', 'find', 'want', 'be', 'there', 'script', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'sister', 'veered', 'off', 'conversation', 'Austin', 'yogurt', 'shop', 'murders', 'missed', 'scene', 'full', 'lots', 'drinking', 'ultimatums', 'arched', 'eyebrows', 'were', 'riveted', 'screen', 'Gloria', 'screaming', 'Mama', 'face', 'was', 'slut', 'time', 'even', 'when', 'shrieking', 'Liz', 'irresistible', 'Gloria', 'movie', 'loved', 'awful', 'moment', 'loved']",Butterfield 8 VHS
