I just adore this coming- of-age film, this was Witherspoon's first major movie and boy you could tell way back then she was gonna be a huge star.

311170,A3IRBCCB3I5PPD,6302413737,"Anastasia McPherson ""Bibliophile""","[1, 1]","The Man in the Moon is as good today as it was almost twenty years ago when I saw it in the theatre. The story, the acting, the setting and the themes of forgiveness and familial love are as timeless today as they were then. The story centers around Dani, a fourteen year old who becomes smitten with the older boy next door. The two explore their relationship, but three years is a big gap at that age and Dani isn't ready for what Court, a young man suddenly responsible for a farm and the well-being of his mother and yournger brothers, needs in a relationship. Court then meets Dani's older sister Maureen who has been longing for a love that is real. The sisters experience betrayal, tragedy and rapprochement in the course of the story and the message of forgiveness and love is affecting.A few others have criticized this film for being overly earnest - as a sometime cynic myself I have to criticize this view and find it very sad indeed that sincerity is taken for saccharine in a film where the former overwhelms the later. See this film with your children or to remember your own youth or to remember that we must all strive for goodness and the blessing of love.",5,A Perfect Little Jewel-Box of a Movie,1272326400,"04 27, 2010",2010,1174,"['Man', 'Moon', 'as', 'good', 'today', 'was', 'almost', 'twenty', 'years', 'when', 'saw', 'theatre', 'story', 'acting', 'setting', 'themes', 'forgiveness', 'familial', 'love', 'are', 'timeless', 'today', 'were', 'then', 'story', 'centers', 'Dani', 'fourteen', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'smitten', 'older', 'boy', 'door', 'two', 'explore', 'relationship', 'three', 'years', 'big', 'gap', 'age', 'Dani', ""n't"", 'ready', 'what', 'Court', 'young', 'man', 'suddenly', 'responsible', 'farm', 'well-being', 'mother', 'yournger', 'brothers', 'needs', 'relationship', 'Court', 'then', 'Dani', 'older', 'sister', 'Maureen', 'who', 'been', 'longing', 'love', 'real', 'sisters', 'experience', 'betrayal', 'tragedy', 'rapprochement', 'course', 'story', 'message', 'forgiveness', 'love', 'affecting.A', 'few', 'others', 'have', 'criticized', 'film', 'being', 'overly', 'earnest', 'sometime', 'cynic', 'myself', 'have', 'criticize', 'view', 'find', 'very', 'sad', 'indeed', 'sincerity', 'taken', 'saccharine', 'film', 'where', 'former', 'later', 'See', 'film', 'children', 'remember', 'own', 'youth', 'remember', 'must', 'strive', 'goodness', 'blessing', 'love']",Man in the Moon VHS
311171,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302413737,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","When I was dating my now wife, she made me watch this movie.  I was not thrilled.  I was sixteen.  This looked like a chick flick, and even more so, this looked like a little girl's movie.  I will admit, I spaced out through most of it anyways.  It held no interest with me.Years later, I have a very different reaction to this film.`The Man in the Moon' tells the coming of age story of a young fourteen year old girl named Dani, living in Louisiana during the 1950's.  Dani has an older sister, Maureen, who has captured the eye of Court, a young man who Dani happens to have a severe crush on.  As Dani makes herself a `friend' of Court, she becomes supremely jealous of his affections toward her sister, but it isn't as easy has `first crush syndrome'.  No, `The Man in the Moon' gets a little deeper than that.Watching this as an adult, I am drawn to the beautiful way in which Dani is fleshed out as a real, true, complete character.  Reese Witherspoon delivers quite possibly her finest performance to date (seriously, she is outstanding here).  The way she pulls out of Dani so much passion is remarkable.  The rest of the cast, from Sam Waterston to Jason London is exception in their roles, but it is Witherspoon that carries this film on her shoulders and does so with such commanding ferocity.This is not a mere kid's movie (in fact, certain scenes take this out of that `genre' entirely) and this is not just for the girls.

311173,A1UX6GTMKEH98J,6302413737,"Anne ""Eclectic Bookworm""","[0, 0]","This was Reese Witherspoon's first movie role, she was 14 and already shows remarkable talent.  I have always loved both Tess Harper and Sam Waterston and their roles in this movie are wonderful as was Emily Warfield and newcomer Jason London.  This is a beautiful movie set in an era when times were simpler.The story is set in 1957 in rural Louisiana, in a time where family values were prevalent and children were brought up with manners.  The Trant's are loving parents, but they expect their children to follow their rules, which include doing chores and using words like, mam and sir when addressing them or other adults and saying please and thank you.  At 14, Dani is on the cusp of being a young woman, but she has a tendency to run to the pond on hot summer days instead of helping with more of the chores.  Mother, Abigail is pregnant with what her husband prays is his long awaited son to join their three daughters. Maureen the eldest daughter is 17 and she is both beautiful and smart.  This is her last summer at home, as she has an academic scholarship to attend Duke in the fall.One of my favorite scenes occurs early in the movie.  Maureen is going to a dance, her father wants her to put a sweater over her dress, and she tells him, ""I don't have anything that goes with my dress.""  He then tells her to change dresses, but lets her wear the dress when he sees his wife shaking her head and mouthing the word no.  He then proceeds to tell her date that he is responsible for his daughter for the time they are out, he expects her home on time, and no excuses will be acceptable.  Neither teen makes any objections, plead to be allowed to stay out later or act unhappy of disapproving about the restrictions placed on their date.  Parents were obeyed without questions or arguments.  Dating was a privilege and young men were expected to follow the rules your parents set and to treat you with respect.When the Foster family moves back to their farm after their father dies they resume the friendship that started when the adults were teenagers.  Court is the oldest at 17 and the 2 other twin boys are 9 (I think).  Court is struggling trying to work the farm while his mother works in a factory to support the family.  The pond that Dani swims in is part of the Foster family's property and they first meet when Court jumps in and surprises Dani, who is skinny-dipping.  They immediately start fighting and Dani leaves after making Cort turn around so he will not see her as she retrieves her clothes.  She has no idea that he is part of the family that will be joining them for dinner later that evening.  What follows is a beautiful, heart-warming story of a young girl experiencing her first love only to find that not only does he not feel the same way but he has fallen in love with her sister.  Maureen has not just been a sister to Dani; she has been her best friend. Both girls will have their first experience with both love and broken hearts.  In the end, it is their strong sense of family and its love that allows Dani to forgive what she feels as Maureens's betrayal as they comfort and support each other.I am not sure why this movie wasn't better received when it was released but I am happy that we can buy it to watch and enjoy.  I first saw this film when it appeared on one of the cable channels and loved the movie.  The next time I convinced my teenage daughter to watch it with me and she loved it as much as I did.  It became one of our favorite movies.  It was the only movie besides Titanic that she watched more than once.  Miranda did not like watching TV she considered it a waste of time and would rather have been doing things with her friends instead.  Watching this movie with her is one of my cherished memories.",5,A BEAUTIFUL HEART-WARMING STORY WITH AN EXCELLENT CAST  (SOME SPOILERS),1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,3765,"['was', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'first', 'movie', 'role', 'was', '14', 'already', 'remarkable', 'talent', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'Tess', 'Harper', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'roles', 'movie', 'are', 'wonderful', 'was', 'Emily', 'Warfield', 'newcomer', 'Jason', 'London', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'set', 'era', 'when', 'times', 'were', 'simpler.The', 'story', 'set', '1957', 'rural', 'Louisiana', 'time', 'where', 'family', 'values', 'were', 'prevalent', 'children', 'were', 'brought', 'up', 'manners', 'Trant', 'are', 'loving', 'parents', 'expect', 'children', 'follow', 'rules', 'include', 'doing', 'chores', 'using', 'words', 'mam', 'sir', 'when', 'addressing', 'other', 'adults', 'saying', 'please', 'thank', '14', 'Dani', 'cusp', 'being', 'young', 'woman', 'tendency', 'run', 'pond', 'hot', 'summer', 'days', 'instead', 'helping', 'more', 'chores', 'Mother', 'Abigail', 'pregnant', 'what', 'husband', 'prays', 'long', 'awaited', 'son', 'join', 'three', 'daughters', 'Maureen', 'eldest', 'daughter', '17', 'beautiful', 'smart', 'last', 'summer', 'home', 'academic', 'scholarship', 'attend', 'Duke', 'fall.One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'early', 'movie', 'Maureen', 'going', 'dance', 'father', 'put', 'sweater', 'dress', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'dress', 'then', 'change', 'dresses', 'wear', 'dress', 'when', 'wife', 'shaking', 'head', 'mouthing', 'word', 'then', 'tell', 'date', 'responsible', 'daughter', 'time', 'are', 'out', 'home', 'time', 'excuses', 'will', 'be', 'acceptable', 'teen', 'objections', 'plead', 'be', 'allowed', 'stay', 'out', 'later', 'act', 'unhappy', 'disapproving', 'restrictions', 'placed', 'date', 'Parents', 'were', 'obeyed', 'questions', 'arguments', 'Dating', 'was', 'privilege', 'young', 'men', 'were', 'expected', 'follow', 'rules', 'parents', 'set', 'treat', 'respect.When', 'Foster', 'family', 'back', 'farm', 'father', 'resume', 'friendship', 'started', 'when', 'adults', 'were', 'teenagers', 'Court', 'oldest', '17', '2', 'other', 'twin', 'boys', 'are', '9', 'think', 'Court', 'struggling', 'trying', 'work', 'farm', 'mother', 'factory', 'support', 'family', 'pond', 'Dani', 'part', 'Foster', 'family', 'property', 'first', 'meet', 'when', 'Court', 'surprises', 'Dani', 'who', 'skinny-dipping', 'immediately', 'start', 'fighting', 'Dani', 'making', 'Cort', 'turn', 'around', 'so', 'will', 'not', 'see', 'clothes', 'idea', 'part', 'family', 'will', 'be', 'joining', 'dinner', 'later', 'evening', 'What', 'beautiful', 'heart-warming', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'experiencing', 'first', 'love', 'only', 'find', 'not', 'only', 'not', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'fallen', 'love', 'sister', 'Maureen', 'not', 'just', 'been', 'sister', 'Dani', 'been', 'best', 'friend', 'girls', 'will', 'have', 'first', 'experience', 'love', 'broken', 'hearts', 'end', 'strong', 'sense', 'family', 'love', 'Dani', 'forgive', 'what', 'Maureens', 'betrayal', 'comfort', 'support', 'other.I', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'better', 'received', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'am', 'happy', 'can', 'buy', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'when', 'appeared', 'one', 'cable', 'channels', 'loved', 'movie', 'next', 'time', 'convinced', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'watch', 'loved', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'became', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'was', 'only', 'movie', 'Titanic', 'watched', 'more', 'once', 'Miranda', 'did', 'not', 'watching', 'TV', 'considered', 'waste', 'time', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'things', 'friends', 'instead', 'Watching', 'movie', 'one', 'cherished', 'memories']",Man in the Moon VHS

311177,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,6302413737,Bobby Underwood,"[46, 48]","This poignant and tender coming of age story is a small but beautiful film many have not had the opportunity to see. It is set in rural Louisiana during the 1950's and is beautifully photographed and filled with love and tenderness. The focal point of director Robert Mulligan's fine film is a very young Reese Witherspoon. The story of first love and the tragedy that follows will touch you in a way you'll remember for a long time.Sam Waterson is the kind and gentle husband and father who knows his two daughters are growing up faster than he can blink and has one more on the way. Tess Harper has another fine turn as his loving wife Abigail. There is a very human and peaceful feel to this film that works its way into your heart slowly and remains there long after the closing credits.Dani (Reese Witherspoon) is the spunky but tender-hearted 14 year old younger sister who is beginning to cross the waters from child to young womanhood. Her adolescent crush on Elvis Presley changes to something real when 17 year old Court Foster (Jason London) enters the picture. They both like to swim in the lake and become something more than friends but something less than a couple. Their relationship is handled in such a sweet and thoughtful manner you find youself embracing this film with your heart early on.But as much as Court cares about her she is too young for him and when chance brings he and her older sister Maureen (Emily Wakefield) together nature takes its course and someone's heart is bound to break. This is a good and loving family and Dani and her older sister Maureen are close. They bicker as sisters do but Dani secretly worships Maureen and wants to be like her. Maureen loves Dani just as much but can't pass up the love of her life no matter how hard she might try.Court is also portrayed as a very decent kid with the weight of the world on his shoulders who is trying to do the right thing and still be happy. Everthing about this feels real, as there are no good guys and bad guys, just a truthful portrait of young love and growing up. Witherspoon is amazing and you can truly feel her heart breaking as she begins to disappear, only her memories of the lake and her first kiss to comfort her.It will take even more than a tragedy to bring Dani and Maureen back together and it is the wise and gentle father who takes Dani fishing and talks to her in a way every father hopes he will talk to his daughter under similar circumstances. Everyone is wonderful in this fine film and I am amazed it is not more widely known. It is truly something special.I will not reveal what happens in the last part of this film but at the beginning we find Dani and Maureen talking on their front porch about ""The Man in the Moon."" Their mother always told them when they were young to tell their troubles to him and just keep talking untill they were all gone. Both Dani and Maureen discover when things are bleakest that ""The Man in the Moon"" is truly each other.This film is bittersweet and heartrending. It is a wonderful find and different from just about anything else you will see on the subject matter. It is a film you'll want to own and watch over and over.",5,A Tender Story,1116806400,"05 23, 2005",2005,3179,"['poignant', 'tender', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'small', 'beautiful', 'film', 'many', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'opportunity', 'see', 'set', 'rural', 'Louisiana', '1950', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'filled', 'love', 'tenderness', 'focal', 'point', 'director', 'Robert', 'Mulligan', 'fine', 'film', 'very', 'young', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'story', 'first', 'love', 'tragedy', 'will', 'touch', 'way', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'long', 'time.Sam', 'Waterson', 'kind', 'gentle', 'husband', 'father', 'who', 'two', 'daughters', 'are', 'growing', 'up', 'faster', 'can', 'blink', 'one', 'more', 'way', 'Tess', 'Harper', 'fine', 'turn', 'loving', 'wife', 'Abigail', 'very', 'human', 'peaceful', 'feel', 'film', 'way', 'heart', 'slowly', 'long', 'closing', 'credits.Dani', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'spunky', 'tender-hearted', '14', 'year', 'old', 'younger', 'sister', 'who', 'beginning', 'cross', 'waters', 'child', 'young', 'womanhood', 'adolescent', 'crush', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'changes', 'something', 'real', 'when', '17', 'year', 'old', 'Court', 'Foster', 'Jason', 'London', 'picture', 'swim', 'lake', 'become', 'something', 'more', 'friends', 'something', 'less', 'couple', 'relationship', 'handled', 'such', 'sweet', 'thoughtful', 'manner', 'find', 'embracing', 'film', 'heart', 'early', 'on.But', 'as', 'much', 'Court', 'too', 'young', 'when', 'chance', 'older', 'sister', 'Maureen', 'Emily', 'Wakefield', 'together', 'nature', 'course', 'someone', 'heart', 'bound', 'break', 'good', 'loving', 'family', 'Dani', 'older', 'sister', 'Maureen', 'are', 'close', 'bicker', 'sisters', 'do', 'Dani', 'secretly', 'Maureen', 'be', 'Maureen', 'Dani', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pass', 'up', 'love', 'life', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'might', 'try.Court', 'also', 'portrayed', 'very', 'decent', 'kid', 'weight', 'world', 'shoulders', 'who', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'still', 'be', 'happy', 'Everthing', 'feels', 'real', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'just', 'truthful', 'portrait', 'young', 'love', 'growing', 'up', 'Witherspoon', 'amazing', 'can', 'truly', 'feel', 'heart', 'breaking', 'disappear', 'only', 'memories', 'lake', 'first', 'kiss', 'comfort', 'her.It', 'will', 'take', 'even', 'more', 'tragedy', 'bring', 'Dani', 'Maureen', 'back', 'together', 'wise', 'gentle', 'father', 'who', 'Dani', 'fishing', 'talks', 'way', 'father', 'will', 'talk', 'daughter', 'similar', 'circumstances', 'Everyone', 'wonderful', 'fine', 'film', 'am', 'amazed', 'not', 'more', 'widely', 'known', 'truly', 'something', 'special.I', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'what', 'last', 'part', 'film', 'beginning', 'find', 'Dani', 'Maureen', 'talking', 'front', 'porch', 'Man', 'Moon', 'mother', 'always', 'told', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'tell', 'troubles', 'just', 'keep', 'talking', 'were', 'gone', 'Dani', 'Maureen', 'discover', 'when', 'things', 'are', 'bleakest', 'Man', 'Moon', 'truly', 'other.This', 'film', 'bittersweet', 'heartrending', 'wonderful', 'find', 'different', 'just', 'anything', 'else', 'will', 'see', 'subject', 'matter', 'film', ""'ll"", 'want', 'own', 'watch']",Man in the Moon VHS

311182,A2364DJDJWF5LO,6302413737,Chase Leon,"[1, 1]","Director Robert Mulligan sure has a gift when it comes to capturing emotional realism on film. He demonstrated this with previous films like ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" and ""Summer of 42."" Of course there are many talents behind a successful story that's told with film, but ultimately it all falls on the director to combine all the elements and make it work, and this man is extraordinary in that capacity.As with ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" Mulligan has extracted an exceptional ""ensemble performance"" from a gifted cast. The small roles are just as important as the larger ones, and every word in every scene really counts. The cast in ""The Man in the Moon"" clearly understood this, so every character here matters. This particular cast had amazing chemistry, and were utterly believable and convincing from first scene to the last. Five minutes into the film and you, the viewer, have been pulled into this family's world and are invited to stay for awhile and experience life with them. This is not an easy task to accomplish, yet Mulligan makes it all so seem so effortless. This film rolls along at such a perfect pace, and every scene is so immaculately shot, that it literally puts you there and you truly become emotionally involved.The entire cast are incredibly splendid, but I really must single out Reese Witherspoon. Just as Mary Badham became 'Scout' in To Kill a Mockingbird, here Reese becomes Dani Trant. This child's performance is simply natural, believable and hugely impressive.Mulligan must have supernatural gifts when it comes to directing children and teens,  because his resume boasts some of the best young performances ever committed to film.Also of note are the small nuances of the characters and the painfully accurate attention paid to the smallest details all throughout the film.The actual story here is a true slice-of-life tale. It's fun, funny, warm, sad, heartbreaking, inspiring .... again, it's about life, and it's beautifully served to you on a platter by a wonderful director who keeps it real.If you like believable cinema about life, then I would highly recommend this gentle masterpiece. I refuse to call it a ""hidden gem"" or an ""over-looked good film,"" because it is truly a flat-out masterpiece of realism in cinema. These type of films are rare, especially at this level of perfection, so do give it a try.If you enjoy this type of film, which concerns strong and realistic stories about family and friends, then I would also highly recommend ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" ""The Station Agent,"" ""Stand By Me,"" ""The Sandlot,"" ""Sling Blade,"" and ""Raggedy Man"" for starters.",5,"A ""Coming of Age"" masterpiece",1375833600,"08 7, 2013",2013,2617,"['Director', 'Robert', 'Mulligan', 'sure', 'gift', 'when', 'capturing', 'emotional', 'realism', 'film', 'demonstrated', 'previous', 'films', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'Summer', '42', 'course', 'are', 'many', 'talents', 'successful', 'story', 'told', 'film', 'ultimately', 'director', 'combine', 'elements', 'make', 'work', 'man', 'extraordinary', 'capacity.As', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'Mulligan', 'extracted', 'exceptional', 'ensemble', 'performance', 'gifted', 'cast', 'small', 'roles', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'important', 'larger', 'ones', 'word', 'scene', 'really', 'cast', 'Man', 'Moon', 'clearly', 'understood', 'so', 'character', 'here', 'matters', 'particular', 'cast', 'had', 'amazing', 'chemistry', 'were', 'utterly', 'believable', 'convincing', 'first', 'scene', 'last', 'Five', 'minutes', 'film', 'viewer', 'have', 'been', 'pulled', 'family', 'world', 'are', 'invited', 'stay', 'awhile', 'experience', 'life', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'accomplish', 'yet', 'Mulligan', 'so', 'seem', 'so', 'effortless', 'film', 'along', 'perfect', 'pace', 'scene', 'so', 'immaculately', 'shot', 'literally', 'truly', 'become', 'emotionally', 'involved.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'are', 'incredibly', 'splendid', 'really', 'must', 'single', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Just', 'Mary', 'Badham', 'became', ""'Scout"", 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'here', 'Reese', 'becomes', 'Dani', 'Trant', 'child', 'performance', 'simply', 'natural', 'believable', 'hugely', 'impressive.Mulligan', 'must', 'have', 'supernatural', 'gifts', 'when', 'directing', 'children', 'teens', 'resume', 'best', 'young', 'performances', 'ever', 'committed', 'film.Also', 'note', 'are', 'small', 'nuances', 'characters', 'painfully', 'accurate', 'attention', 'paid', 'smallest', 'details', 'film.The', 'actual', 'story', 'here', 'true', 'slice-of-life', 'tale', 'fun', 'funny', 'warm', 'sad', 'heartbreaking', 'inspiring', 'again', 'life', 'beautifully', 'served', 'platter', 'wonderful', 'director', 'who', 'believable', 'cinema', 'life', 'then', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'gentle', 'masterpiece', 'refuse', 'call', 'hidden', 'gem', 'over-looked', 'good', 'film', 'truly', 'flat-out', 'masterpiece', 'realism', 'cinema', 'type', 'films', 'are', 'rare', 'especially', 'level', 'perfection', 'so', 'do', 'give', 'try.If', 'enjoy', 'type', 'film', 'strong', 'realistic', 'stories', 'family', 'friends', 'then', 'would', 'also', 'highly', 'recommend', 'What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'Station', 'Agent', 'Stand', 'Me', 'Sandlot', 'Sling', 'Blade', 'Raggedy', 'Man', 'starters']",Man in the Moon VHS

This is the style of film that harkens back to the days when a good script, solid acting, and inspired direction was all any studio needed to have a great film.  This film has a fantastic coming-of-age tale set in 1950s Louisiana and is so often absolutely believable that I felt transported, even nostalgic for a time in which I was never even alive.  Director Robert Mulligan, most famous for directing &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird,&quot; has such a light, fluid touch with camera angles and complex panning sequences that it feels almost organic.  The movie practically flows through you as you watch it.  Then there are the splendid acting performances.  Sam Waterston, a favorite actor of mine since &quot;The Killing Fields,&quot; gives the whole package here from wit and strength to fear and being at a total loss for words when intense situations occur.  Tess Harper has a more limited role, serving as a strong foundation as the mother and wife, but when the scene calls for it she shines accordingly.  Jason London has some splendid scenes, particularly with both Reese Witherspoon and Emily Warfield who play sisters who both fall in love with the young man.  Reese Witherspoon is very impressive here for being so young.  Oftentimes, young actors are so mature for their ages that they have forgotten how to behave like a kid.  Reese is exceptional here!  Then there is Emily Warfield.  Let me just quote Reese's character by saying, &quot;You're so pretty that it hurts!&quot;  She is amazingly beautiful and uses so much subtlety in her performance that when she has to completely breakdown near the end it is truly visceral.  There is so much said by all these character actors with exceptional facial expression and outstanding emotional rapport with one another, that by the time the story takes a tragic turn leaving the viewer stunned and wiping away tears, one cannot help but care about every character that remains.  Most of the scenes leading up to the emotional ending are light-hearted and endearing, which in turn adds to the impact of an incredibly sad ending.  Have some tissues handy.  I've seen this film four times and even though I am prepared in mind for what I know will happen, I am blinking away tears and wiping my face repeatedly every time.  But no ending in any character film I've ever seen can be sad if the viewer doesn't care about the characters and what they are doing througout the story.  The price for this sparkling gem is spectacular!  If you have a penchant for great acting and all around solid filmmaking then look no further than this endearing and ultimately heartwrenching film.

And yes, it will bring tears to your eyes.  For those who are already heading for the hills, you'll be making a huge mistake.  After all, it's directed by the same man (Robert Mulligan) who gave us ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and ""The Summer of 42"".""The Man in the Moon"" is a small film that came out in 1991 and I, among millions of others, missed its theatrical release.  Heck, most missed its video release.  This is really a shame because these movie treasures come far too infrequently.  They get pigeon-holed and lumped together with all the other Hollywood-style attempts to depict family drama (which runs from the banal to okay, and even to pretty good).  So I'm here to ""unlump"" it.This marvelous story centers around two teenage sisters, Dani and Maureen (age 14 and 17 respectively) and their attraction and love for the same boy (Court Foster, played nicely by Jason London).  Set in the 1950s on a rural Louisiana farm, this film richly depicts the setting and ambience of this era.  Much like ""Stand by Me"", it shows us the unfettered freedom that children had in a small, rural community in those days...a freedom sadly lacking today.Wonderfully acted throughout, special attention should go to Sam Waterston (the father), Tess Harper (the mother), and Reese Witherspoon (Dani).  This is not, let me repeat, not an overblown melodrama.  This movie knows exactly where it is going and it pin-points the target at every turn.  Today, where ""coming of age"" films mean boy gets girl, this film takes a fresh and absolutely honest approach, catapulting it far above the others of this genre.  Between 1 and 10, ""The Man in the Moon"" gets the highest mark, a 10.  When one looks at the jacket, you'll see over-used words such as ""poignant"" and ""bittersweet"".

311197,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,6302413737,Gregor von Kallahann,"[14, 15]","This much admired 1991 sleeper is noteworthy for several reasons.  It introduced the remarkable young actress Reese Witherspoon to the viewing public--or at least that portion of the viewing public that bothered to see it.  It also made a for a successful (de facto) ""coming of age"" trilogy for director Robert Mulligan, among whose previous successes were TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD and THE SUMMER OF '42.  It also had beautiful, evocative cinematography by Freddie Francis.And it gets its 1950s feel just about right (although I did find myself asking, ""Did 14 year olds really say 'WHATEVER' in 1957?"")The story is simple and sweet.  Young girl meets slightly older boy, who in turn falls for her older sister.  Sibling rivalry for the affections of a third party is a tale older than Childe Ballads, but the intelligent script and sensitive direction makes MAN IN THE MOON something special.  For the first hour or so, the film hits nary a false note.And then it did--at least for me.  I don't like to second guess any narrative development, but I found the film's ending a bit of a let-down.  (SPOILER WARNING!)  The fact that the girls' heated rivalry for their neighbor's affection is interrupted by tragedy, a tragedy that ultimately leads to their reconciliation, seems almost too easy dramatically.  Or maybe it's just too rushed.  Fourteen year old Dani's flirtation with the older neighbor Court proceeds almost languidly, but his torrid romance with older sister Maureen takes up maybe 15 minutes of screen time.  Court's demise is premature in more ways than one.I would have preferred to see the older teens' relationship detailed more.  Maureen's loss might have ultimately have seemed more profound then.  One can argue of course that at 17, a brief relationship can have all the force and drama of longstanding affair.  Agreed, but how long did the two star crossed lovers actually have.  A day and a half?  The dramatic possibilities of their love and the sisters' rivalry are ultimately curbed.It's an arguable point, and knowing me, should I re-view this film in a month or so, I'll likely find that it flows perfectly and wonder what the heck I was complaining about.  Still I hope other admirers of this movie will understand when I say that I probably just a bit frustrated because I wanted the movie to be a little longer.  I think they might agree that it would be nice to get to know these wonderful characters a little better.While Reese Witherspoon deserves the attention her debut role brought her, it should probably be mentioned that ALL the performances are spot on.  You expect as much from veterans Tess Harper and Sam Waterston, but the other young actors are also remarkable.  Jason London projects both the ease and the awkwardness of a seventeen year old just growing into his own body.  Emily Warfield, who unfortunately seems to have no screen credits since 1995, is equally good as the remarkably self-aware and poised Maureen.And if they ever wanted to make a sequel, I'd recommend following up with the story of Court's mom played beautifully by Gail Strickland.  She's one character I wanted to know more about.  Losing both her husband and her son in separate farm accidents within a short span of time would, of course, be devastating.  But Strickland projects such strength and steely reserve that one can only imagine that her continuing story would be fascinating.",4,"Wonderful Witherspoon, Waterston, Warfield...et al.",1099440000,"11 3, 2004",2004,3409,"['much', 'admired', '1991', 'sleeper', 'noteworthy', 'several', 'reasons', 'introduced', 'remarkable', 'young', 'actress', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'viewing', 'public', 'least', 'portion', 'viewing', 'public', 'bothered', 'see', 'also', 'made', 'successful', 'de', 'facto', 'coming', 'age', 'trilogy', 'director', 'Robert', 'Mulligan', 'previous', 'successes', 'were', 'TO', 'KILL', 'A', 'MOCKINGBIRD', 'THE', 'SUMMER', 'OF', ""'42"", 'also', 'had', 'beautiful', 'evocative', 'cinematography', 'Freddie', 'Francis.And', '1950s', 'feel', 'just', 'about', 'right', 'did', 'find', 'asking', 'Did', '14', 'year', 'olds', 'really', 'say', ""'WHATEVER"", '1957', 'story', 'simple', 'sweet', 'Young', 'girl', 'meets', 'slightly', 'older', 'boy', 'who', 'turn', 'falls', 'older', 'sister', 'Sibling', 'rivalry', 'affections', 'third', 'party', 'tale', 'older', 'Childe', 'Ballads', 'intelligent', 'script', 'sensitive', 'direction', 'MAN', 'IN', 'THE', 'MOON', 'something', 'special', 'first', 'hour', 'so', 'film', 'false', 'note.And', 'then', 'did', 'least', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'second', 'guess', 'narrative', 'development', 'found', 'film', 'ending', 'bit', 'let-down', 'SPOILER', 'WARNING', 'fact', 'girls', 'heated', 'rivalry', 'neighbor', 'affection', 'interrupted', 'tragedy', 'tragedy', 'ultimately', 'reconciliation', 'almost', 'too', 'easy', 'dramatically', 'just', 'too', 'rushed', 'Fourteen', 'year', 'old', 'Dani', 'flirtation', 'older', 'neighbor', 'Court', 'almost', 'languidly', 'torrid', 'romance', 'older', 'sister', 'Maureen', 'up', 'maybe', '15', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'Court', 'demise', 'premature', 'more', 'ways', 'one.I', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'see', 'older', 'teens', 'relationship', 'detailed', 'more', 'Maureen', 'loss', 'might', 'have', 'ultimately', 'have', 'seemed', 'more', 'profound', 'then', 'One', 'can', 'argue', 'course', '17', 'brief', 'relationship', 'can', 'have', 'force', 'drama', 'longstanding', 'affair', 'Agreed', 'how', 'long', 'did', 'two', 'star', 'crossed', 'lovers', 'actually', 'have', 'day', 'half', 'dramatic', 'possibilities', 'love', 'sisters', 'rivalry', 'are', 'ultimately', 'curbed.It', 'arguable', 'point', 'knowing', 'should', 're-view', 'film', 'month', 'so', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'find', 'perfectly', 'wonder', 'what', 'heck', 'was', 'complaining', 'about', 'Still', 'hope', 'other', 'admirers', 'movie', 'will', 'understand', 'when', 'say', 'probably', 'just', 'bit', 'frustrated', 'wanted', 'movie', 'be', 'little', 'longer', 'think', 'might', 'agree', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'get', 'know', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'little', 'better.While', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'attention', 'debut', 'role', 'brought', 'should', 'probably', 'be', 'mentioned', 'performances', 'are', 'spot', 'expect', 'much', 'veterans', 'Tess', 'Harper', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'other', 'young', 'actors', 'are', 'also', 'remarkable', 'Jason', 'London', 'projects', 'both', 'ease', 'awkwardness', 'seventeen', 'year', 'old', 'just', 'growing', 'own', 'body', 'Emily', 'Warfield', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'have', 'screen', 'credits', '1995', 'equally', 'good', 'remarkably', 'self-aware', 'poised', 'Maureen.And', 'ever', 'wanted', 'make', 'sequel', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'following', 'up', 'story', 'Court', 'mom', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Gail', 'Strickland', 'one', 'character', 'wanted', 'know', 'more', 'Losing', 'husband', 'son', 'separate', 'farm', 'accidents', 'short', 'span', 'time', 'would', 'course', 'be', 'devastating', 'Strickland', 'projects', 'such', 'strength', 'steely', 'reserve', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'continuing', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'fascinating']",Man in the Moon VHS

With Robert Mulligan, the director of 'To Kill A Mockingbird' and 'The Summer of 42' at the helm, and a 14 year old Reese Witherspoon as Dani, who shines in the role of a coming of age teenage girl in love for the first time, the film certainly starts out on the right foot.IN A NUTSHELL: A TALE OF 2 SISTERS [some plot spoilers below]Its roughly the summer of 1957 in rural Louisiana. Maureen Trant, 17, [Emily Warfield] and Dani Trant, 14, [Reese Witherspoon] are sisters. Very close bonds hold them together, but this summer will put a strain on their relationship. The strain comes in the form of Mr. Right appearing without warning as the boy next store. His name is Court Foster [Jason London] and he is 17 years old.The trouble is, Dani saw him first, or more correctly he saw her. The family knows that Dani has an older friend next store who happens to a boy, but owing to the age differences and the boy's character nobody is worried -- except Court. He's got a little girl following him around and he has to admit it too himself that he wants her around -- and perhaps more -- too much more?!THEN THE PLOT THICKENS: [more plot spoilers below]Maureen never sees Court until we're about halfway through the summer, since she was out on a date when his family returned to the farm and they had dinner at the Trants. When she does see him, he has come to their house to visit Dani, but then something happens.Court and Maureen are obviously taken with each other and Dani can't believe it. How could her sister betray her like this? From this point on the movie is about the strain between the two sisters when Mr. Right appears to both of them as the perfect man.Robert Mulligan - DirectorSam Waterston  - Matthew TrantTess Harper  - Abigail TrantGail Strickland  - Marie FosterReese Witherspoon  - Dani TrantJason London  - Court FosterEmily Warfield  - Maureen TrantBentley Mitchum  - Billy SaundersABOUT THE DVD: EXCELLENT WIDESCREEN TRANSFERSPECIAL FEATURES: THEATRICAL TRAILER & SCENE SELECTIONS - WISH THERE WERE MOREBOTTOM LINE: THIS IS A 'REEL' SLICE OF LIFE THAT WON'T DISAPPOINTThis is quite a little story with a big punch.

But there's another part of her that longs to be grown up, to wear makeup and have boys stare at her admiringly -- just the way they do at Dani's 17-year-old sister Maureen (Emily Warfield).Then a new boy comes to town and changes everything. Court Foster (Jason London) is quickly befriended by both Trant sisters. Yet it's Maureen that's closer to Court in age, and thus the one he'd seriously consider as girlfriend.Naturally, Dani is furious -- and beneath that, hurt and jealous. Why does Maureen get *everything*?! She gets along well with their parents, she's so beautiful, and she's about to go off to college (not so common for a rural Southern girl in 1957). For all that anyone cares about Dani, she may as well be an equal of their toddler sister Marie.Yet as the summer progresses -- and tragedy rocks their quiet complacent life -- that Dani truly begins to understand a little about life. No matter what may appear on the surface, there is no one without questions or suffering on the inside, and the further into adulthood she goes, the worse it will get. But, as Dani also begins to see, the true hallmark of adulthood is how a person chooses to react to what happens in her life, and how she supports those around her as they experience their own hardships.Tess Harper and Sam Waterston also star as the girls' parents, Abigail and Sam Trant.While the story being told here is simple and in no way extraordinary, it somehow manages to become complex for just those reasons. Like real life, this quiet summer of 1957 has the power to change a family's lives forever, just by a single event and the ripples of the events that churn out from it. Whether viewers are currently struggling with the transition from child to young adult like Dani, or reminiscing on years past, all are guaranteed to enjoy this thought-provoking film.",4,A refreshingly simple yet complex coming of age story,1390694400,"01 26, 2014",2014,2133,"['Fourteen-year-old', 'Dani', 'Trant', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'awkward', 'age', 'female', 'must', 'go', 'Part', 'Dani', 'still', 'joys', 'always', 'known', 'such', 'running', 'family', 'rural', 'Louisiana', 'farm', 'ragged', 'shorts', 't-shirts', 'going', 'swimming', 'old', 'quarry', 'part', 'be', 'grown', 'up', 'wear', 'makeup', 'have', 'boys', 'stare', 'admiringly', 'just', 'way', 'do', 'Dani', '17-year-old', 'sister', 'Maureen', 'Emily', 'Warfield', '.Then', 'new', 'boy', 'town', 'changes', 'everything', 'Court', 'Foster', 'Jason', 'London', 'quickly', 'befriended', 'Trant', 'sisters', 'Maureen', 'closer', 'Court', 'age', 'thus', 'one', ""'d"", 'seriously', 'consider', 'girlfriend.Naturally', 'Dani', 'furious', 'beneath', 'hurt', 'jealous', 'Why', 'Maureen', 'get', '*everything*', 'along', 'well', 'parents', 'so', 'beautiful', 'go', 'off', 'college', 'not', 'so', 'common', 'rural', 'Southern', 'girl', '1957', 'anyone', 'Dani', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'equal', 'toddler', 'sister', 'Marie.Yet', 'summer', 'tragedy', 'rocks', 'quiet', 'complacent', 'life', 'Dani', 'truly', 'understand', 'little', 'life', 'matter', 'what', 'may', 'appear', 'surface', 'one', 'questions', 'suffering', 'inside', 'further', 'adulthood', 'worse', 'will', 'get', 'Dani', 'also', 'see', 'true', 'hallmark', 'adulthood', 'how', 'person', 'react', 'what', 'life', 'how', 'experience', 'own', 'hardships.Tess', 'Harper', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'also', 'star', 'girls', 'parents', 'Abigail', 'Sam', 'Trant.While', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'here', 'simple', 'way', 'extraordinary', 'somehow', 'become', 'complex', 'just', 'reasons', 'real', 'life', 'quiet', 'summer', '1957', 'power', 'change', 'family', 'lives', 'forever', 'just', 'single', 'event', 'ripples', 'events', 'churn', 'out', 'viewers', 'are', 'currently', 'struggling', 'transition', 'child', 'young', 'adult', 'Dani', 'reminiscing', 'years', 'are', 'guaranteed', 'enjoy', 'thought-provoking', 'film']",Man in the Moon VHS

This film takes you by surprise, and engages you in a candid, fresh and  charming way.  Reese Witherspoon is guileless, and perfect as the heroine;  Sam Waterston, in his usual well-crafted way, gives the father a gravity,  dignity and grace that Atticus Finch, the lawyer father in Mockingbird,  would be proud of.  The love story, which provides the film its core plot,  tenderly examines from nearly every viewpoint -- familial and otherwise --  the joys and heartaches of that first rush of emotion that overtakes us all  at some point in our youth.  The watering-hole sequences have such a simple  yet intense quality that you are transported back to your own fumblings  with affection and those crushes that crippled your vision of the world for  as long as they lasted.  This movie deserved a much wider audience when it  first appeared, but I have kind of loved the fact that it remains one of  those special gifts you can give that will continue to give once its viewer  takes the time to unlock its secrets.

311229,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,6302413737,Sean Pasek,"[0, 0]","Everyone can remember that one moment in time from which we despised the opposite sex and viewed them as ""gross"" or ""disgusting"" to the moment when we fall hopelessly in love.  Often, this occurs so quickly that we don't realize or even understand what has just happened.  There is no rational explanation for a young teenager who suddenly finds him/herself in love.  The body reacts in new ways that are foreign, exciting, and confusing.  Young teens often resist these feelings at first because they are now in completely new territory.Dani is a 14-year-old girl (brilliantly played in her debut role by Reese Witherspoon) who lies in bed listening to the man of her dreams on a record player: Elvis.  She has posters of Elvis all over her side of the bedroom.  She is at that viable age when she's asked to take on more responsibilities around the house, but runs off to her favorite swimming hole on hot summer days.  It is at this age that Dani is in the transition of moving from a young girl to a young woman.  It is a confusing time that brings more questions than answers.Dani looks up to her older sister, Maureen, who is seventeen.  She often asks Maureen about the future.  Maureen is an attractive young woman who is planning to take her academic talents to Duke.  Maureen is also confused, but she is more worried about the unknowns that loom in the future.  Maureen is a romantic.  She has had limited experience with boys, who all have eyes for her, but she is waiting for that one boy to come in and sweep her off of her feet.  She views life and love through her windows of idealism.The irony with both girls is that while Maureen tries her best to explain to Dani what being in love is like, what the strange feelings are, how to kiss a boy, etc., she, herself, has never really been in love either.  It is likely she has had infatuations and crushes, but with boys who just never live up to her expectations.  Billy Sanders, her current date, is borderline despicable in the way he treats her, or rather, mistreats her.Enter Court Foster, a young boy who is Maureen's age, who moves into a neighboring farm with his widowed mother and two little brothers.  He is a hard-working boy who has more or less assumed the fatherly role.  He works at the run-down farm all day trying to get it repaired and up-and-running.  Court inadvertently runs into Dani while she is skinny-dipping at her swimming hole.  At first, they don't like each other much, but it isn't long before Dani can't think of anyone else.  However, the three-year gap is more than enough for the viewer to realize that, while Court is very fond of Dani, it is hard to conceive of anything ever growing from it.Dani suffers from being nave and inexperienced, which is natural for her age.  Court finally meets Maureen, and from the get-go, it is clear much to Dani's dismay, that they are attracted to each other.  Dani doesn't take it well, and she views it more of a betrayal on Maureen's part than Court's.  After all, Maureen knew of Dani's feelings toward Court, even though Court explains to Maureen that he just doesn't feel the same way, even though he is very fond of Dani.  Before long Maureen and Court are falling deeply in love.The story takes place in the late 50s, when minding and obeying your parents was the way of life.  Matthew and Abigail Trant are strict but loving parents.  Matthew does not tolerate any kind of back-talk or questioning from his children.  The kids have jobs and chores to do, and they are expected to do them without complaint.  Even communication holds a strict d&eacute;cor as the kids are expected to always address their parents as ""sir"" or ""ma'am.""Sam Waterston is simply magnificent as Matthew Trant.  This is my favorite role of his.  He portrayed Matthew as a complex, discipline-minded father who also loves his children.  Tess Harper is equally effective as Abigail.Robert Mulligan, the director, is known for taking on realistic projects, often involving some kind of teen angst in which a teen is growing and experiencing new feelings for the first time.  He also directed ""Summer of `42"" which was also a story about a young boy falling in love with a woman who was older than he was.  As with that film, we find that as a teen, there is no explanation for these feelings.  They happen, and it doesn't matter how illogical or irrational those feelings may be.  Most people, I have found, have experienced this at some point.  Dani also falls into this category.  She is too young to date, as her father points out, and she often has no idea how to effectively express her feelings toward Court, but she tries nonetheless.Something occurs within the realm of the story that I will not divulge here for anyone who has not seen this film.  It is important that the viewer's reaction be genuine.  While the story may appear to be about young love (and much of the story is about that), the heart is actually in the power and the bond between sisters.  Matthew Trant points out to Dani, ""You and Maureen are going to be sisters for a long time.""  Young love can often test the bonds of any other relationship because within the eyes of the beholder, nothing else matters, and no one else matters as much as the object of your affection.  Remember those high school days when a friend began a relationship with someone and you hardly ever heard from the person again?  Young love, especially first-time love, is often so overwhelming that you cannot think of anyone else.The Man in the Moon handles the relationships aspects with frightening realism and accuracy.  Perhaps that is why so many people can relate to the characters in this film because most of us have been there and experienced what these two sisters experience from the standpoint of first love.",5,Power and Angst of Teen Love in This All Too Realistic Depiction,1342483200,"07 17, 2012",2012,5793,"['Everyone', 'can', 'remember', 'one', 'moment', 'time', 'despised', 'opposite', 'sex',

The best scene in the film is one between the two of them, when she apologizes to him for his ""taking the strap"" to her and he, her father, comes around to the other side of the car and takes her in his arms even though he cannot make eye contact. Wow -- only an iceberg would not have a tissue in hand here.Unfortunately, the film milks the melodrama a little too vigorously. The first half is interesting, restrained if sentimental, but it raises serious questions about the loyalty to family in the arena of passion. In the second half, the film-makers simply pull out all the stops and to a fault. I don't want to spoil the plot, but let me just say that the final scene -- which ""unites"" two estranged characters prone over a grave -- is simply too much.The film has potential, but gives it over to emotionalism. Hey, even we chicks have our standards!Still, worth renting.",3,The Moon goes over the Top,1142208000,"03 13, 2006",2006,973,"['Sam', 'Waterston', 'wonderful', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'later', 'brilliant', 'film', 'career', 'best', 'scene', 'film', 'one', 'two', 'when', 'taking', 'strap', 'father', 'around', 'other', 'side', 'car', 'arms', 'even', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'eye', 'contact', 'Wow', 'only', 'iceberg', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'tissue', 'hand', 'here.Unfortunately', 'film', 'melodrama', 'little', 'too', 'vigorously', 'first', 'half', 'interesting', 'restrained', 'sentimental', 'serious', 'questions', 'loyalty', 'family', 'arena', 'passion', 'second', 'half', 'film-makers', 'simply', 'pull', 'out', 'stops', 'fault', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'plot', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'final', 'scene', 'unites', 'two', 'estranged', 'characters', 'prone', 'grave', 'simply', 'too', 'much.The', 'film', 'potential', 'emotionalism', 'Hey', 'even', 'chicks', 'have', 'standards', 'Still', 'worth', 'renting']",Man in the Moon VHS
