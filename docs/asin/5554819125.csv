The most obvious potential drawback in the movie is the age difference between the two main characters. However, in spite of this there ends up being a good deal of romantic spark and the movie ends up being pretty good. This is a fairly standard romantic movie in which two characters who seem to loathe each other at the beginning end up being forced to work together because of circumstances and end up falling in love. The circumstances in this case are that the two end up briefly marooned on an uninhabited island with pirates chasing them. There are a number of humorous scenes involving the main characters and the girl's fianc&eacute;e, David Schwimmer of Friend's fame, who stays behind on the main island and a few dramatic action scenes.

Dalton,"[3, 8]","I saw this movie for the first time on the USA channel, and I missed the beginning of it, but the last half seemed interesting enough, so I bought this DVD, to see the uncut version of the movie.  I must say I felt rather disappointed by this limp and tepid PG-13 presentation.Harrison Ford is getting a bit long in the tooth to play these romantic leading man roles, but he&#8217;s still fun to watch, anyway.  Here he&#8217;s a South Seas beachcomber/bush pilot, who hires out to fly tourists from island to island in a decrepit plane (a deHaviland Beaver, which ceased production in 1967) that&#8217;s almost as old as he is.  Fashion magazine editor Anne Heche hires him to fly her to a magazine shoot on another island, interrupting her vacation with her fiancee, and bad weather causes them to crash-land on the beach of a deserted island.How the 56 year old Ford and the 29 year old Heche survive and eventually fall in love is the crux of the story.  There are some amusing moments in this Robinson Crusoe-girl Friday adventure, such as a small aquatic creature swimming into Heche&#8217;s underwear while she&#8217;s standing waist-deep in a waterfall-fed lake, and Ford, to the rescue, has to feel around for it, as she tells him, &#8220;I better not catch you smiling!&#8221;  And later, when she demands her money back, because he didn&#8217;t get her to her destination, he only gives her half of it, saying, &#8220;I figure I got you halfway!&#8221;Still, the chemistry between Ford and Heche isn&#8217;t really there, and the entire sequence with the band of pirates is totally out of place and unbelievable.  It should have been deleted and some ... scenes of Heche and the delightful Jacqueline Obradors added to spice up this tropical soap-opera.  And this DVD should have been spiced up with some decent bonus features, too!  All you get here are the standard features: the movie trailer and a scene index.  Not much for the money!

195973,AK6MY2AQUMLTR,5554819125,Brandon Cutro,"[7, 7]","Randy Edelman continues to impress me scoring hit after hit and this one is a perfect example of that. Edelman goes hawaiian with this score (due to the setting of the film) and throws in an impressive orchestral sound to accompany it. The theme first appears in ""Into the Mist"" and has that trademark Edelman sound with soaring strings and cymbal crashes that put the icing on the cake. The theme itself is the love theme of the film and is pretty. It occurs a lot throughout the score in various places, but is not overused. The other motif is a hawaiian dance tune, complete with guitars, synthesizers, orchestra, and lots of percussion. It makes you want to get up and dance like an idiot (I wouldn't try it). This thematic material occurs most noticeably in ""Maketea"", ""Pink Kawala"", ""Fixing the Old Beaver"", and the odd sounding ""Lunching with Peacocks"", which I read somewhere sounds like ""Lunching with Alka-Seltzer"" (listen to the beginning of the track to see what I mean). The other tracks to point out are ""Crashdance"" and ""Pirates"" which has the same percussion work as ""The Race"" in ""The Skulls"" soundtrack also composed by Edelman. Tailing off the soundtrack is a song by Taj Mahal which is one of the dumbest songs i've ever heard. Your best bet is to stop after track 20 and skip track 21, unless off-beat music with lyrics that you cannot understand are your thing.

But from the very  moment she met Ford as a bumbling, seeminly-inept island-hopper pilot,  I  saw some chemistry beginning to happen and the cloud of her personal life  slowly dissipated and cleared away.  Ford has already established himself  as an actor with many sides, and probably called upon his Indiana Jones'  days to pull off the same goofy, scatter-brained act as Quinn.  Heche has  got comic, inept and klutz written all over her from the moment she takes  the Xanax in that turbulent, storm-tossed ride in the deHavilland Beaver  (which still is one of the best  bush planes ever made).  You could ask  many questions about the reality of the events that occur in this movie,  but I think you'd be missing the point.  This is a movie made for laughter,  romance and Ford and Heche's acting capabilities. Heche captivated me with  her oh-soooo-blue eyes and drew me in with her acting ability.  She really  is very good and I hope others see that. Ford is always fun to watch,  whether in dramatic or comic roles.  David Schwimmer pulls of being, well,  David Schwimmer from 'Friends'. He's got a lot of work to do to make  himself believable as anyone else. Final assessment: Ford, 2 thumbs and 2  big toes up; Heche, 2 thumbs and 1 big toe up (You are great!); Schwimmer,  1 thumb up for almost making himself believable.

It might not be so bad if the film wasn't so 90s. The dated presentation and production design really is quite distracting in the present day.Anne Heche and the wooden David Schwimmer play a couple in love who take a quick vacation to the South Pacific. Harrison Ford plays the grouchy pilot who flies them to their island resort. But a mishap leads to a plane crash leaving Ford and Heche stranded while Schwimmer has to mourn his lost love, leading to the not-so-shocking revelation that he the experience had revealed no character to him whatsoever. A fact that the writer tries to cover-up by not-so-cleverly working it into the dialogue.The dialogue and humor is cheap, simply, and easy. The music generic and dated. All this film really has going for it is some pretty scenery. They try to liven things up by introducing pirates 30 minutes from the end, but they seem unnaturally shoehorned in. None of them are given names, have barely 5 minutes screen time, and hardly any dialogue.The trailers promised an old-fashioned island adventure movie. What they actually gave us was more of a romantic comedy. There were action scenes featured in the trailer that are not in the movie. The running time of 101 minutes and the very abrupt resolution gives the impression that there was more action and plot before someone ordered it to be cut out.What's left is just an okay movie. It is neither original nor clever and has no spark, no edge, and no bite. David Schwimmer once more proves he can only do one character (Ross Geller) and can't even do it very well.Six Days, Seven Nights is hardly groundbreaking but is an enjoyable time-waster.

L LaRegina ""Jim LaRegina""","[4, 8]","The poster for SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS made me think it's an action picture, with Harrison Ford and Anne Heche in the wilderness, looking scared. When I read the video package, I  learned it is a comedy-adventure.If it shows up on cable TV or if you can borrow a copy, SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS nicely kills a couple of hours. Lead actor Ford is in top form, playing the tough/funny guy he played so well in the INDIANA JONES movies.Lead actress Anne Heche, playing a combination of Lucille Ball, Liza Minelli and Shelly Long, holds her own alongside the great Ford.  Someday, perhaps she will blossom even more elsewhere.SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS director Ivan Reitman seems to specialize in comedy-adventures, having made GHOSTBUSTERS, TWINS and STRIPES. In SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS, Ford and Heche are stranded on a small island, fighting starvation, pirates and their attraction to each other.Sometimes you can tell when a film is written by a man. In SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS, we have yet another 50-plus leading man hooking up with an under-30 woman. At least Heche, while attractive, is no knockout, so that gives it a little credibility. So does the fact that Ford is in better shape than a lot of men thirty years his junior.Before he has even gotten to know Anne Heche in SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS, Harrison Ford makes a couple of remarks about her anatomy that, in real life, would have turned off any woman no matter how much she had liked him. But this is the movies (movies written by men), so instead Heche wonders if she looks good enough. Sigh.Most ridiculous: at one point in the film Ford and Heche are hiding from pirates, yet they light a fire. Sigh.But between the man's world mentality and movie cliches, SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS delivers enough fun for one hour, forty-two minutes.",2,"One hour, forty-two minutes",991094400,"05 29, 2001",2001,1789,"['poster', 'SIX', 'DAYS', 'SEVEN', 'NIGHTS', 'made', 'think', 'action', 'picture', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'wilderness', 'looking', 'scared', 'When', 'read', 'video', 'package', 'learned', 'comedy-adventure.If', 'up', 'cable', 'TV', 'can', 'borrow', 'copy', 'SIX', 'DAYS', 'SEVEN', 'NIGHTS', 'nicely', 'couple', 'hours', 'Lead', 'actor', 'Ford', 'top', 'form', 'playing', 'tough/funny', 'guy', 'played', 'so', 'well', 'INDIANA', 'JONES', 'movies.Lead', 'actress', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'playing', 'combination', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'Liza', 'Minelli', 'Shelly', 'Long', 'own', 'alongside', 'great', 'Ford', 'Someday', 'perhaps', 'will', 'blossom', 'even', 'more', 'elsewhere.SIX', 'DAYS', 'SEVEN', 'NIGHTS', 'director', 'Ivan', 'Reitman', 'specialize', 'comedy-adventures', 'having', 'made', 'GHOSTBUSTERS', 'TWINS', 'STRIPES', 'SIX', 'DAYS', 'SEVEN', 'NIGHTS', 'Ford', 'Heche', 'are', 'stranded', 'small', 'island', 'fighting', 'starvation', 'pirates', 'attraction', 'other.Sometimes', 'can', 'tell', 'when', 'film', 'written', 'man', 'SIX', 'DAYS', 'SEVEN', 'NIGHTS', 'have', 'yet', '50-plus', 'leading', 'man', 'hooking', 'up', 'under-30', 'woman', 'least', 'Heche', 'attractive', 'knockout', 'little', 'credibility', 'So', 'fact', 'Ford', 'better', 'shape', 'lot', 'men', 'thirty', 'years', 'junior.Before', 'even', 'gotten', 'know', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'SIX', 'DAYS', 'SEVEN', 'NIGHTS', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'couple', 'remarks', 'anatomy', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'turned', 'off', 'woman', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'had', 'liked', 'movies', 'movies', 'written', 'men', 'so', 'instead', 'Heche', 'wonders', 'good', 'enough', 'Sigh.Most', 'ridiculous', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'Ford', 'Heche', 'are', 'hiding', 'pirates', 'yet', 'light', 'fire', 'Sigh.But', 'man', 'world', 'mentality', 'movie', 'cliches', 'SIX', 'DAYS', 'SEVEN', 'NIGHTS', 'delivers', 'enough', 'fun', 'one', 'hour', 'forty-two', 'minutes']",N/A

He picks up a charter to fly Robin Monroe from her holiday idyll to a meeting in Tahiti. Robin is sad to be leaving her fiancee Frank (Shwimmer) behind on the island. Quinn is not sad to be leaving his voluptuous assistant Angelica (Obradors) as he has been hitting on Robin during her holiday.So, Quinn and Robin fly off to Tahiti but, en route, they encounter a storm and, with the aircraft damaged by a lightning strike, they make a forced landing on an otherwise deserted island. Then they have to survive the snakes and earth tremors, dodge the pirates, repair the aircraft with bits rescued from a crashed Japanese WWII fighter and make a daring escape in order that they can return to civilisation and fall in love properly.OK, it is not much of a plot but then &quot;The African Queen&quot; had little plot and that became a classic because of the interaction between Bogart and Hepburn. So, how do Ford and Heche do?Harrison Ford does very well indeed. It helps that he has a real &quot;Harrison Ford&quot; character and script. Quinn has just the right mix of faults and redeeming attributes to be believable and likeable. Ford acts just as well as always when given a sympathetic character and the script really gives him the chance to shine.If Ford gets close to Bogart level as Quinn, Heche is some way short of Hepburn as Robin. The character comes over as shallow and uninteresting and not particularly likeable. In part that is the nature of the character and the opportunities afforded by the script, but it is also the way that Heche and her director interpret the character.Shwimmer and Obradors have minor characters who exist merely to enable the plot. The roles are not very demanding and the acting is not that good.So, the movie mostly depends on the strength of Harrison Ford and he does the job. The film is worth watching for his performance alone.",3,Harrison Ford fans will not be disappointed.,973468800,"11 6, 2000",2000,2454,"['film', 'clearly', 'cross', 'African', 'Queen', 'something', 'else', 'something', 'else', 'could', 'be', 'one', 'dozens', 'films', 'Bogart', 'amp', 'Hepburn', 'classic', 'was', 'clearly', 'source', 'setting', 'characters.The', 'aim', 'plot', 'arrange', 'Ford', 'Heche', 'be', 'isolated', 'semi', 'hostile', 'environment', 'where', 'Ford', 'earthy', 'get-it-done', 'character', 'can', 'slowly', 'chip', 'away', 'revulsion', 'Heche', 'sophisticated', 'newly', 'engaged', 'big', 'city', 'girl.Harrison', 'Ford', 'Quinn', 'Harris', 'pilot', 'mould', 'Antoine', 'de', 'Saint', 'Exupery', 'plying', 'islands', 'South', 'Seas', 'up', 'charter', 'fly', 'Robin', 'Monroe', 'holiday', 'idyll', 'meeting', 'Tahiti', 'Robin', 'sad', 'be', 'leaving', 'fiancee', 'Frank', 'Shwimmer', 'island', 'Quinn', 'not', 'sad', 'be', 'leaving', 'voluptuous', 'assistant', 'Angelica', 'Obradors', 'been', 'hitting', 'Robin', 'holiday.So', 'Quinn', 'Robin', 'fly', 'Tahiti', 'route', 'encounter', 'storm', 'aircraft', 'damaged', 'lightning', 'strike', 'make', 'forced', 'landing', 'otherwise', 'deserted', 'island', 'Then', 'have', 'survive', 'snakes', 'earth', 'tremors', 'dodge', 'pirates', 'repair', 'aircraft', 'bits', 'rescued', 'crashed', 'Japanese', 'WWII', 'fighter', 'make', 'daring', 'escape', 'order', 'can', 'return', 'civilisation', 'fall', 'love', 'properly.OK', 'not', 'much', 'plot', 'then', 'quot', 'African', 'Queen', 'quot', 'had', 'little', 'plot', 'became', 'classic', 'interaction', 'Bogart', 'Hepburn', 'So', 'how', 'do', 'Ford', 'Heche', 'do', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'very', 'well', 'indeed', 'real', 'quot', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'quot', 'character', 'script', 'Quinn', 'just', 'right', 'mix', 'faults', 'redeeming', 'attributes', 'be', 'believable', 'likeable', 'Ford', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'always', 'when', 'given', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'script', 'really', 'chance', 'shine.If', 'Ford', 'close', 'Bogart', 'level', 'Quinn', 'Heche', 'way', 'short', 'Hepburn', 'Robin', 'character', 'over', 'shallow', 'uninteresting', 'not', 'particularly', 'likeable', 'part', 'nature', 'character', 'opportunities', 'afforded', 'script', 'also', 'way', 'Heche', 'director', 'character.Shwimmer', 'Obradors', 'have', 'minor', 'characters', 'who', 'exist', 'merely', 'enable', 'plot', 'roles', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'demanding', 'acting', 'not', 'good.So', 'movie', 'mostly', 'strength', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'job', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'performance', 'alone']",N/A

196032,A152C8GYY25HAH,5554819125,Matthew Horner,"[6, 14]","Traditionally, a romantic story, or one that sweeps the audience away with Hollywood emotions, appears in the summer and is a boxoffice smash. Critics often give it their grudging approval. In the 1990s we have had Sleepless in Seattle, While You Were Sleeping, and My Best Friend's Wedding. Hope Floats and Six Days, Seven Nights were 1998's contenders. Both were reviewed poorly. They did okay at the ticket boxes, but comments I heard implied that they did so almost by default.Six Days, Seven Nights was the heavyweight entry. Harrison Ford returned to a romantic lead. Anne Heche got a chance to prove she could be a femme fatale. Ivan Reitman had directed many hits. Corporate giant Walt Disney was behind the project. The setting, a tropical paradise, seemed fool proof.Perhaps all the powerful players got complacent. A key element called a script seems to have been overlooked.There's a story line that tries to pass for a plot. I have a theory that people who like movies don't often go in with the attitude that that they won't enjoy the show. In fact, we want to be swept away and to be entertained. Unfortunately, we sometimes see holes too large ignore. These diminish our pleasure greatly. We may not be able to verbalize the experience, but we don't recommend the movie to our acquaintances. The best we can say - glumly - is that it was all right.Anne Heche plays a New York stereotype. She has a top management job on a woman's magazine. We never know exactly what it is she does there, just that she looks and acts successful. Her boyfriend is played by David Schwimmer, whose character is no better defined than hers. If she is a stereotype, he is a cartoon. He is the male of the species portrayed as barely domesticated. Left alone with any woman under sixty, he sees the situation only in a sexual way. That's just the way all guys are, we are told.Off they go to paradise. After arriving in Tahiti, they find that their scheduled chartered flight has been canceled. They are expected to fly in a leaky, broken down four seat plane, piloted by Harrison Ford's character. The implication is that air safety stops at America's borders. Ford brings along a beautiful native girl, who he says is the flight attendant. She isn't. He's just a guy, remember.They arrive at their destination. Reggae music plays until someone remembers that this is the South Pacific, not the Caribbean. Soon Heche's boss says she must go back to Tahiti on business. This gives the movie an excuse to maroon Heche and Ford on a deserted island. Only in the movies could an island so large, so lush and so close to Tahiti be uninhabited. If it looks like part of the Hawaiian Islands, it's because the movie was filmed there.This part is where the movie could have soared, but Heche's brittle, worldly character gives in far to soon to Ford's laid back, peaceful guy. There turns out not to be much to tame in this woman. Perhaps the film makers were trying to be politically correct, but in the old romantic comedies, the girl tamed the guy as often as he corralled her. They have an affair, while her boyfriend and his island girl do the same back at the resort. This, too, could have been clever and funny, but it's wasted here.Randy Edelman contributes one of the best film scores of 1998. He must have been inspired by what the movie should have been, not by what it is.",2,Uninspired romantic movie,1017273600,"03 28, 2002",2002,3372,"['Traditionally', 'romantic', 'story', 'one', 'audience', 'away', 'Hollywood', 'emotions', 'summer', 'boxoffice', 'smash', 'Critics', 'often', 'give', 'grudging', 'approval', '1990s', 'have', 'had', 'Sleepless', 'Seattle', 'Were', 'Sleeping', 'My', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Wedding', 'Hope', 'Floats', 'Six', 'Days', 'Seven', 'Nights', 'were', '1998', 'contenders', 'were', 'reviewed', 'poorly', 'did', 'okay', 'ticket', 'boxes', 'comments', 'heard', 'implied', 'did', 'so', 'almost', 'default.Six', 'Days', 'Seven', 'Nights', 'was', 'heavyweight', 'entry', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'returned', 'romantic', 'lead', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'got', 'chance', 'prove', 'could', 'be', 'femme', 'fatale', 'Ivan', 'Reitman', 'had', 'directed', 'many', 'hits', 'Corporate', 'giant', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'was', 'project', 'setting', 'tropical', 'paradise', 'seemed', 'fool', 'proof.Perhaps', 'powerful', 'players', 'got', 'complacent', 'key', 'element', 'called', 'script', 'have', 'been', 'story', 'line', 'pass', 'plot', 'have', 'theory', 'people', 'who', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'go', 'attitude', 'wo', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'show', 'fact', 'want', 'be', 'swept', 'away', 'be', 'entertained', 'Unfortunately', 'sometimes', 'see', 'holes', 'too', 'large', 'ignore', 'diminish', 'pleasure', 'greatly', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'verbalize', 'experience', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'acquaintances', 'best', 'can', 'say', 'glumly', 'was', 'right.Anne', 'Heche', 'New', 'York', 'stereotype', 'top', 'management', 'job', 'woman', 'magazine', 'never', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'there', 'just', 'successful', 'boyfriend', 'played', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'character', 'better', 'defined', 'hers', 'stereotype', 'cartoon', 'male', 'species', 'portrayed', 'barely', 'domesticated', 'Left', 'alone', 'woman', 'sixty', 'situation', 'only', 'sexual', 'way', 'just', 'way', 'guys', 'are', 'are', 'told.Off', 'go', 'paradise', 'arriving', 'Tahiti', 'find', 'scheduled', 'chartered', 'flight', 'been', 'canceled', 'are', 'expected', 'fly', 'leaky', 'broken', 'down', 'four', 'seat', 'plane', 'piloted', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'character', 'implication', 'air', 'safety', 'America', 'borders', 'Ford', 'beautiful', 'native', 'girl', 'who', 'flight', 'attendant', ""n't"", 'just', 'guy', 'remember.They', 'arrive', 'destination', 'Reggae', 'music', 'someone', 'remembers', 'South', 'Pacific', 'not', 'Caribbean', 'Soon', 'Heche', 'boss', 'must', 'go', 'back', 'Tahiti', 'business', 'movie', 'excuse', 'maroon', 'Heche', 'Ford', 'deserted', 'island', 'Only', 'movies', 'could', 'island', 'so', 'large', 'so', 'lush', 'so', 'close', 'Tahiti', 'be', 'uninhabited', 'part', 'Hawaiian', 'Islands', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'there.This', 'part', 'where', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'soared', 'Heche', 'brittle', 'worldly', 'character', 'far', 'soon', 'Ford', 'laid', 'back', 'peaceful', 'guy', 'out', 'not', 'be', 'much', 'tame', 'woman', 'Perhaps', 'film', 'makers', 'were', 'trying', 'be', 'politically', 'correct', 'old', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'girl', 'tamed', 'guy', 'as', 'often', 'corralled', 'have', 'affair', 'boyfriend', 'island', 'girl', 'do', 'same', 'back', 'resort', 'too', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'clever', 'funny', 'wasted', 'here.Randy', 'Edelman', 'one', 'best', 'film', 'scores', '1998', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'inspired', 'what', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'not', 'what']",N/A

The days of Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Witness,  Bladerunner, and American Graffiti, seem long behind us.  He is still the  consummate action hero, and his portrayals are always watchable (a la Sean  Connery who seems to elevate any film he's in above what it otherwise would  be).  But in the past few years, Ford's films have been, on the whole,  disappointingly average.  That is why Six Days, Seven Nights is such a nice  surprise.  It is a romantic comedy which seamlessly blends action, humour  (Ford is very funny in his portrayal of Quinn), and romance (yes, despite  Anne Heche's well-publicized real life sexual orientation, there is a real  chemistry between the two).  Throw in some beautiful locales and a subplot  involving the two's significant others, and what you've got is a nice rainy  Sunday afternoon film, reminiscent of the old black and white Cary Grant /  Katherine Hepburn comedies.  It's not Indiana Jones, unfortunately, but  thank goodness it's not Random Hearts either.  The DVD itself contains no  extras whatsoever.

196059,AJDYDG7YZY9QL,5554819125,Stephen A. Haines,"[1, 3]","Castaway movies are fun.  They have to be or no-one would watch them.  Given transparent  plots and inevitable circumstances, characterization is all that remains to redeem them.  The  choice of Harrison Ford as lead was inspired in this film.  Too many Ford roles  seem below  abilities exhibited elsewhere, but he carries this one well.  As his foil Anne Heche was a  pleasant surprise.  She displays an exceptional talent, even in a role nearly doomed by the  trite story.  They make a great castaway team, bringing some engrossing subtleties to play.Ford's an island hopping pilot in the Western Pacific, ferrying passengers and cargo as  opportunity arises.  It's not an easy life, nor financially rewarding, but there are benefits.  There's the scenery, including the human type.  There's freedom.  And there's flying.  Ford as  the pilot of a DeHavilland Norseman brilliantly takes on the role every pilot, even of only a  four seater, must assume - he's &quot;the captain&quot;.  Inevitably, that brings him into conflict with  Heche's part as the modern, corporate, self-assertive woman.  It's a beautifully portrayed  clash, fully liberating this film from the mundane.  In the best scene in the  film, Ford's actually invisible as he tries to regain control over events.Survival, however, means teamwork and the pair do settle down to the business of escape or  rescue.  Heche's arrogance virtually eliminates the second option, and the arrival of some  unwelcome visitors nearly obviates the first.  But the team is now functional and they evade  an unhappy fate through cooperative effort.  The suspense builds nicely until that situation is  resolved.  The collective action reaches a fever pitch [when do they eat?] as they strive to  engineer an escape.  The mechanism of their return to the resort might be considered  contrived if some astute producer hadn't settled on the choice of the Norseman as Ford's  aircraft.  No other airplane could have survived the indignities this film bestows on it.There's really only one other meaningful character in this film.  David Schwimmer is a perfect  Frank Martin as Heche's fiancee.  And why not?  He's simply playing himself with no acting  involved.  He doesn't need to develop any skills if the directors continue to run him in similar  roles.  Schwimmer's typecasting was done in an iron foundry.  Fortunately, the role is needed,  so we can't argue that he detracts from the film or story.  The fine job done by Ford and Heche  nearly make Schwimmer superfluous, but Heche needs him to set her character properly.This film seemed pretty lightweight at first look, but is well worth repeats.  It's entertainment  value has few peers in the type and the scenery alone is worth review.  It's still a mystery,  however, as to why Bob Marley was chosen for the closing music.  Perhaps the producer,  having shot his bolt in selecting the Norseman, thought the story takes place in the Caribbean.",4,A flight into fantasy,985132800,"03 21, 2001",2001,2956,"['Castaway', 'movies', 'are', 'fun', 'have', 'be', 'no-one', 'would', 'watch', 'Given', 'transparent', 'plots', 'inevitable', 'circumstances', 'characterization', 'redeem', 'choice', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'lead', 'was', 'inspired', 'film', 'Too', 'many', 'Ford', 'seem', 'abilities', 'exhibited', 'elsewhere', 'one', 'well', 'foil', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'exceptional', 'talent', 'even', 'role', 'nearly', 'doomed', 'trite', 'story', 'make', 'great', 'castaway', 'team', 'bringing', 'engrossing', 'subtleties', 'play.Ford', 'island', 'hopping', 'pilot', 'Western', 'Pacific', 'ferrying', 'passengers', 'cargo', 'opportunity', 'arises', 'not', 'easy', 'life', 'financially', 'rewarding', 'are', 'benefits', 'scenery', 'including', 'human', 'type', 'freedom', 'flying', 'Ford', 'pilot', 'DeHavilland', 'Norseman', 'brilliantly', 'role', 'pilot', 'even', 'only', 'four', 'seater', 'must', 'assume', 'quot', 'captain', 'quot', 'Inevitably', 'conflict', 'Heche', 'part', 'modern', 'corporate', 'self-assertive', 'woman', 'beautifully', 'portrayed', 'clash', 'fully', 'liberating', 'film', 'mundane', 'best', 'scene', 'film', 'Ford', 'actually', 'invisible', 'regain', 'control', 'events.Survival', 'however', 'teamwork', 'pair', 'do', 'settle', 'down', 'business', 'escape', 'rescue', 'Heche', 'arrogance', 'virtually', 'second', 'option', 'arrival', 'unwelcome', 'visitors', 'nearly', 'first', 'team', 'now', 'functional', 'evade', 'unhappy', 'fate', 'cooperative', 'effort', 'suspense', 'nicely', 'situation', 'resolved', 'collective', 'action', 'fever', 'pitch', '[', 'when', 'do', 'eat', 'strive', 'engineer', 'escape', 'mechanism', 'return', 'resort', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'contrived', 'astute', 'producer', 'had', ""n't"", 'settled', 'choice', 'Norseman', 'Ford', 'aircraft', 'other', 'airplane', 'could', 'have', 'survived', 'indignities', 'film', 'really', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'meaningful', 'character', 'film', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'perfect', 'Frank', 'Martin', 'Heche', 'fiancee', 'why', 'not', 'simply', 'playing', 'acting', 'involved', ""n't"", 'need', 'develop', 'skills', 'directors', 'continue', 'run', 'similar', 'roles', 'Schwimmer', 'typecasting', 'was', 'done', 'iron', 'foundry', 'Fortunately', 'role', 'needed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'argue', 'film', 'story', 'fine', 'job', 'done', 'Ford', 'Heche', 'nearly', 'make', 'Schwimmer', 'superfluous', 'Heche', 'set', 'character', 'properly.This', 'film', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'lightweight', 'first', 'look', 'well', 'worth', 'repeats', 'entertainment', 'value', 'few', 'peers', 'type', 'scenery', 'alone', 'worth', 'review', 'still', 'mystery', 'however', 'why', 'Bob', 'Marley', 'was', 'chosen', 'closing', 'music', 'Perhaps', 'producer', 'having', 'shot', 'bolt', 'selecting', 'Norseman', 'thought', 'story', 'place', 'Caribbean']",N/A

196069,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,5554819125,trebe,"[1, 2]","""Six  Days, Seven Nights"" is a light, romantic, comedy adventure, that follows a familiar formula.  A crusty older man, and a younger woman, who come from different worlds, are brought together by circumstances, and then something special ""happens"".Harrison Ford plays ""Quinn Harris"", a no frills free lance pilot operating his small plane between tropical islands in the South Pacific.  Anne Heche is ""Robin Monroe"" a magazine writer from NY, on vacation with her fianc&eacute; Frank (David Schwimmer), on the island of Makatea.  When she unexpectedly needs transportation to Tahiti to get an interview, she reluctantly hires Ford to fly her there.  Running into bad weather, the plane is forced down, and crash lands on the beach of the proverbial ""uncharted island"".Surviving the crash, the pair begin the task of survival, getting on each other's nerves while exploring their lush surroundings.  Much of this film was shot on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, and we are treated to some truly beautiful topical scenes.  Pirates unexpectedly appear offshore, breaking their solitude and forcing them into a different kind of survival mode.  Finding the wreckage of a plane in the jungle, gives Quinn the material he needs for a dangerous attempt at a return to civilization.The movie finishes in a predictable fashion, but could it ever be any other way?  Logical or not, love will find a way, at least according to Hollywood.  This formula works again, because of the charm and chemistry of the two stars.  When this was released, it was already common knowledge that Heche and Ellen DeGeneres were a couple.  This may influence how you view her performance.  I found Anne Heche totally convincing, charming, and cute to boot.  Heche's and Harrison's acting styles complement each other, and they really benefit from some very clever dialog, and the direction of Ivan Reitman.  There is no denying that Ford (56 when this was made), is slowing down a bit, but though a bit grizzled, he still has the ability to take command of the screen, either with his physical presence, or his boyish charm.If a sappy romance between an older stud and an intelligent young woman doesn't turn you off, by all means give this a chance.",4,"Predictable, but still fun...",1020211200,"05 1, 2002",2002,2220,"['Six', 'Days', 'Seven', 'Nights', 'light', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'adventure', 'familiar', 'formula', 'crusty', 'older', 'man', 'younger', 'woman', 'who', 'come', 'different', 'worlds', 'are', 'brought', 'together', 'circumstances', 'then', 'something', 'special', 'happens', '.Harrison', 'Ford', 'Quinn', 'Harris', 'frills', 'free', 'lance', 'pilot', 'operating', 'small', 'plane', 'tropical', 'islands', 'South', 'Pacific', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'Robin', 'Monroe', 'magazine', 'writer', 'NY', 'vacation', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Frank', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'island', 'Makatea', 'When', 'unexpectedly', 'transportation', 'Tahiti', 'get', 'interview', 'reluctantly', 'Ford', 'fly', 'there', 'Running', 'bad', 'weather', 'plane', 'forced', 'down', 'crash', 'lands', 'beach', 'proverbial', 'uncharted', 'island', '.Surviving', 'crash', 'pair', 'begin', 'task', 'survival', 'getting', 'other', 'nerves', 'exploring', 'lush', 'surroundings', 'Much', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Hawaiian', 'island', 'Kauai', 'are', 'treated', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'topical', 'scenes', 'Pirates', 'unexpectedly', 'appear', 'offshore', 'breaking', 'solitude', 'forcing', 'different', 'kind', 'survival', 'mode', 'Finding', 'wreckage', 'plane', 'jungle', 'Quinn', 'material', 'dangerous', 'attempt', 'return', 'civilization.The', 'movie', 'finishes', 'predictable', 'fashion', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'other', 'way', 'Logical', 'not', 'love', 'will', 'find', 'way', 'least', 'according', 'Hollywood', 'formula', 'again', 'charm', 'chemistry', 'two', 'stars', 'When', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'already', 'common', 'knowledge', 'Heche', 'Ellen', 'DeGeneres', 'were', 'couple', 'may', 'influence', 'how', 'view', 'performance', 'found', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'totally', 'convincing', 'charming', 'cute', 'boot', 'Heche', 'Harrison', 'acting', 'styles', 'complement', 'other', 'really', 'benefit', 'very', 'clever', 'dialog', 'direction', 'Ivan', 'Reitman', 'denying', 'Ford', '56', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'slowing', 'down', 'bit', 'bit', 'grizzled', 'still', 'ability', 'take', 'command', 'screen', 'either', 'physical', 'presence', 'boyish', 'charm.If', 'sappy', 'romance', 'older', 'stud', 'intelligent', 'young', 'woman', ""n't"", 'turn', 'off', 'means', 'give', 'chance']",N/A
