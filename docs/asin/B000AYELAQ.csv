935070,A19W1SLGRZPN77,B000AYELAQ,,"[3, 3]","Backstairs At The White House is a Joy to watch from start to finish, the casting is superb and all the characters are believable.  I love history - but for those who don't - this is an easy way to learn about the past while enjoying a good film.  Leslie Uggams and Olivia Cole play the mother and daughter who work at the White House - they watch what occurs across the years as Presidents come and go (William Howard Taft - Woodrow Wilson - Warren G. Harding - Calvin Coolidge - Herbert Hoover - Franklin D. Roosevelt - Harry Truman - Dwight Eisenhower) It is surprising how much we learn about each President and his family - we share the joy and the sorrow of events that effect the various Presidents, we begin to understand them and feel sympathy for them.  The video is excellent and the sound is very good - you don't have to keep readjusting it. When Backstairs at the White House ends - you wish it could go on and on - to Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon etc.  All the Presidents are played by well known actors - don't miss this one!",5,Backstairs At The Whitehouse,1276387200,"06 13, 2010",2010,1036,"['Backstairs', 'White', 'House', 'Joy', 'watch', 'start', 'finish', 'casting', 'superb', 'characters', 'are', 'believable', 'love', 'history', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'easy', 'way', 'learn', 'past', 'enjoying', 'good', 'film', 'Leslie', 'Uggams', 'Olivia', 'Cole', 'play', 'mother', 'daughter', 'who', 'work', 'White', 'House', 'watch', 'what', 'years', 'Presidents', 'come', 'go', 'William', 'Howard', 'Taft', 'Woodrow', 'Wilson', 'Warren', 'G.', 'Harding', 'Calvin', 'Coolidge', 'Herbert', 'Hoover', 'Franklin', 'D.', 'Roosevelt', 'Harry', 'Truman', 'Dwight', 'Eisenhower', 'surprising', 'how', 'much', 'learn', 'President', 'family', 'share', 'joy', 'sorrow', 'events', 'effect', 'various', 'Presidents', 'begin', 'understand', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'video', 'excellent', 'sound', 'very', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'keep', 'readjusting', 'When', 'Backstairs', 'White', 'House', 'wish', 'could', 'go', 'Kennedy', 'Johnson', 'Nixon', 'etc', 'Presidents', 'are', 'played', 'well', 'known', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'one']",BACKSTAIRS AT THE WHITE HOUSE

In 1909, Maggie Rogers is hired at the White House as a maid to the Presidents family. She is the first African-American woman to hold this key position. Not much of a job considering the long hours, low wages and primadonna like behaviour of some of the President's and their families. The cast is superb and you come to care about each individual staff member as they endure personal tragedies while trying to maintain their jobs. The timeframe is 1909-1961 so there are two world wars, the depression and many other significant events of our history that are covered. Leslie Uggams, is brilliantly cast as Maggie's daughter Lillian who is proud, headstrong and sassy, traits that often drive her poor mother crazy but they love and support one another through life's tribulations in this turbulent era of war and poverty. Lillian starts working at the White House in 1931 because of her incredible skills as a seamstress. She had polio as a child and is left using a crutch for the rest of her life. As each President comes and goes we are treated to glimpses of their personalities. The Hoover's and the Eisenhower's are  my least favorite inhabitants due to their vain and rather vapid approach to dealing with the staff.

935096,A2EW64WI4R74Z8,B000AYELAQ,RestlessBoomer,"[2, 2]","Backstairs at the White House is a very good 70's era miniseries of White House life as seen through the eyes of the staff.  It covers a lot of ground so some details are a little sketchy but I did end up learning some things about lesser-known presidents Taft, Wilson, Harding, Coolidge and Hoover.  I've seen a number of movies about FDR and Truman so I was much more familiar with them.  Dwight Eisenhower and his wife, Mamie, were shown in a less than favorable light and didn't seem to have the rapport with their staff that the other presidents ended up having.At any rate, this is a good miniseries with a lot of well-known actors and actresses including Olivia Cole (excellent at Maggie Rogers), Cloris Leachman (as the snarky Mrs. Jaffrey), Louis Gossett, Jr. and Robert Hooks as Levi Mercer and Mays (two good friends of Maggie's) and countless other stars representing the First Families.  If you can get past Leslie Uggams' constant grinning (which really gets on your nerves after a while), she does a good job of portraying Lillian Rogers Parks on whose memoirs the series was based.This is a good investment in the kind of TV miniseries that are, for the most part, sadly missing from today's television productions.  What makes it even better, there's no gratuitous sex, nudity or bad language and it still--surprise, surprise--manages to be an exceptional series.

Robert Hooks (and his son Kevin), Lou Gossett,and Bill Overton lead of cast of the most handsome black servants ever seen on screen.
