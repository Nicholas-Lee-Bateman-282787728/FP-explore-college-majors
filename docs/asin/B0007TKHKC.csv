This little show only lasted for two lousy seasons, why oh why did the network unfairly yank this show so quick? I never felt this show was preachy or silly. The storylines were strong and well-written. Yes, Joan talks and sees God through various different people but there is always a lesson to be learned at the end of each episode. It really upsets me when quality and thought-provoking shows never get the respect they deserve. Anyways I highly recommend checking out Season One on DVD.

This first season is excellent.  There are so many moments that make you stop and think.  One scene I love is when ""God"" is talking to Joan and makes a comment she doesn't like.  Her response is ""Oh, God.""  To which he says, ""Yes?"" and she says, ""Nothing, I was just... taking your name in vain, actually.""  It makes you realize just how many times we go against what we know is right without even thinking about it.But the show doesn't preach to you.  In fact, it asks more questions than it answers.  There is much to appreciate even if you are not religious.  I love all the times where we see how Joan's actions affect those around her.  Sometimes just her presence where she might not otherwise have been causes good things to happen.  It's good to be reminded how much we all depend on each other.The characters are believable, too.

889608,A47OISX4AV8I,B0007TKHKC,AngelosOne,"[15, 16]","Well, this show is truly something.  It's rather surprising a show of this quality is being put out, considering that many networks are opting to release a constant string of -hurl- reality tv shows.  This show would stand out, even if that were not the situation, but because it's surrounded by reality TV, it makes you appreciate the show even more since all you have for comparison is lame reality tv.Anyhow, Joan of Arcadia at first will make people think of that other Joan who talks to God; Joan of Arc.  However, while it has eluded to be a sort of paralell to that story, the show itself is centered around a believable family and life of teenager Joan.  We are not quite sure exactly why God is talking to Joan (I assume this will be played out throughout the seasons) but like her name sake, we assume she's going to do some major stuff in the future.  The show doesn't show you what she does (in the future) but rather, the path she took to get there.God appears to Joan in many shapes and forms, that surprisingly works for the show.  At first, it was probably used to portray God as everyone's God, since this show makes the point that he is ""real.""  By having him be every race and sex, the show becomes inclusive, as opposed to them having used the common idea of God as an old man.  Or even the femminist view that God is a She.Unfortunately, I did not start watching Joan of Arcadia right away, mostly because I was thinking- blah, another Joan of Arc story copy.  However, I eventually caught an episode (there was nothing else on) and I must say, I was hooked.  I have since tried to watch as much of Joan as possible, even though schedule and life does tend to get in the way.That's one of the reasons why I would recommend buying this DVD release.  For one thing, if you are like me, then you probably missed a lot of the Joan of Arc episodes- well, this is your chance to watch the first season in its entirety.  If you have seen all of Joan on TV, I still recommend this, because now you will always have a copy that you can watch- even down the road, years from now, when the show is over.

""Joan of Arcadia"" is simply one of the best written and most truly human shows on television-- Ever.The Girardi family has a very realistic dynamic, neither syrupy-sweet nor sociopathic. All the characters are smart, funny, varied and individual, sympathetic, and three-dimensional. The show respects its characters and rarely, if ever, resorts to mere stereotypes and oversimplifications. The show asks difficult philosophical and religious questions without descending into cutesy, schmaltzy, sentimentalistic answers-- in fact, it asks more questions than it ever attempts to answer. The writers respect their audience rather patronizing & spoon-feeding.

They have been looking for something comforting and the TV show Joan of Arcadia came along to fulfill this need. In some respects, it is the My So Called Life for the new Millennium. Both shows feature a young, teenage girl as the protagonist dealing with the trials and tribulations of growing up: boys, doing well in school, trying to have some semblance of a social life and, oh yeah, talking to God.If you read the fine print on the back of the box, you will notice that some of the show's music has been changed. Apparently, they couldn't secure the rights to music by Avril Lavigne, Sinead O'Connor, The White Stripes and others. This is a glaring omission and one that takes away from the enjoyment of these episodes.On the first disc is an audio commentary for the ""Pilot"" episode by the show's creator, Barbara Hall and episode director James Hayman. This is a chatty, engaging track as Hayman focuses on the more technical aspects while Hall talks about the show's themes.There are five deleted scenes that include Will laying down the law with a subordinate in the ""Pilot"" and Joan butting heads with Principal Price in ""The Fire and the Wood.""The second disc features three deleted scenes with Joan and her mom having a heart-to-heart in ""Just Say No."" There is more of Kevin getting sick of the special treatment he receives because of his wheelchair in ""The Devil Made Me Do It"" that just feels redundant.The third disc features an audio commentary on ""Jump"" by Hall, Hayman and writer Hart Hanson. Hall points out that the early episodes establish what God can and can't do while Hanson talks about his script and the changes it underwent.There are four deleted scenes that include Will meeting more resistance from a bureaucrat in ""St. Joan"" and an uncomfortable moment between Luke and Glynis in ""The Uncertainty Principle.""On the fourth disc there is an audio commentary on ""Recreation"" by the Girardi family: Amber Tamblyn, Mary Steenburgen, Michael Welch, Jason Ritter and Joe Mantegna. This is something of a let-down as they spend the entire track joking around with each other and commenting on how different they looked back then.There are two deleted scenes that include Joan standing up to Principal Price in ""Double Dutch.""The fifth DVD features three deleted scenes with Kevin screwing up at work and then facing the ramifications of it in ""No Bad Guy.""The sixth disc features an audio commentary on ""The Gift"" by writers Tom Garrigus, David Grae, Joy Gregory and Stephen Nathan. They point out that this is the episode where the Joan-Adam relationship peaks and that they wanted to examine the whole teen sex issue in a non-clich&eacute; way.Hall and Hayman return for the audio commentary on ""Silence."" They deliver another strong track explaining their intentions with this episode. These two are the guiding creative forces on the show and speak very eloquently about it.""The Creation of Joan of Arcadia"" takes a look at how the show came together. The idea for it came to Hall while working on Judging Amy as contemporary take on Joan of Arc.""Joan of Arcadia - A Look at Season One"" is a substantial 18-minute overview. Hall talks about how she picked the show's writers and goes through the casting of the Girardi family and the actors talk about their characters.""God Gallery"" takes us through six reoccurring incarnations of God in the first season, identifies who plays them and why God looks like them. This is an enjoyable extra that provides insight into the casting of God.Finally, there are two deleted scenes that feature little bits of business between characters that was rightly cut.At times, like My So Called Life, Joan of Arcadia gets a little too touchy feely liberal for its own good but, surprisingly, it doesn't try to ram religion down our throats. Ultimately, the show deals with human frailties and notions of tolerance and compassion in a compelling and entertaining way that is comforting in these dark and uncertain times.",4,"Beautiful transfers, good extras...so where's the music?",1115942400,"05 13, 2005",2005,4075,"['9/11', 'secret', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'anxious', 'asking', 'questions', 'feeling', 'unsafe', 'have', 'been', 'looking', 'something', 'comforting', 'TV', 'show', 'Joan', 'Arcadia', 'came', 'along', 'fulfill', 'need', 'respects', 'My', 'So', 'Called', 'Life', 'new', 'Millennium', 'feature', 'young', 'teenage', 'girl', 'protagonist', 'dealing', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'growing', 'up', 'boys', 'doing', 'well', 'school', 'trying', 'have', 'semblance', 'social', 'life', 'oh', 'yeah', 'talking', 'God.If', 'read', 'fine', 'print', 'back', 'box', 'will', 'notice', 'show', 'music', 'been', 'changed', 'Apparently', 'could', ""n't"", 'secure', 'rights', 'music', 'Avril', 'Lavigne', 'Sinead', ""O'Connor"", 'White', 'Stripes', 'others', 'glaring', 'omission', 'one', 'away', 'enjoyment', 'first', 'disc', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Pilot', 'episode', 'show', 'creator', 'Barbara', 'Hall', 'episode', 'director', 'James', 'Hayman', 'chatty', 'engaging', 'track', 'Hayman', 'more', 'technical', 'aspects', 'Hall', 'talks', 'show', 'are', 'five', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'include', 'Will', 'laying', 'down', 'law', 'subordinate', 'Pilot', 'Joan', 'butting', 'heads', 'Principal', 'Price', 'Fire', 'Wood', 'second', 'disc', 'features', 'three', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Joan', 'mom', 'having', 'heart-to-heart', 'Just', 'Say', 'No', 'more', 'Kevin', 'getting', 'sick', 'special', 'treatment', 'wheelchair', 'Devil', 'Made', 'Me', 'Do', 'just', 'redundant.The', 'third', 'disc', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Jump', 'Hall', 'Hayman', 'writer', 'Hart', 'Hanson', 'Hall', 'out', 'early', 'episodes', 'establish', 'what', 'God', 'can', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'Hanson', 'talks', 'script', 'changes', 'are', 'four', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'include', 'Will', 'meeting', 'more', 'resistance', 'bureaucrat', 'St.', 'Joan', 'uncomfortable', 'moment', 'Luke', 'Glynis', 'Uncertainty', 'Principle', 'fourth', 'disc', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Recreation', 'Girardi', 'family', 'Amber', 'Tamblyn', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'Michael', 'Welch', 'Jason', 'Ritter', 'Joe', 'Mantegna', 'something', 'let-down', 'spend', 'entire', 'track', 'joking', 'other', 'commenting', 'how', 'different', 'looked', 'back', 'are', 'two', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'include', 'Joan', 'standing', 'up', 'Principal', 'Price', 'Double', 'Dutch', 'fifth', 'DVD', 'features', 'three', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Kevin', 'screwing', 'up', 'work', 'then', 'facing', 'ramifications', 'No', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'sixth', 'disc', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Gift', 'writers', 'Tom', 'Garrigus', 'David', 'Grae', 'Joy', 'Gregory', 'Stephen', 'Nathan', 'point', 'out', 'episode', 'where', 'Joan-Adam', 'relationship', 'peaks', 'wanted', 'examine', 'whole', 'teen', 'sex', 'issue', 'non-clich', 'eacute', 'way.Hall', 'Hayman', 'return', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Silence', 'deliver', 'strong', 'track', 'explaining', 'intentions', 'episode', 'two', 'are', 'guiding', 'creative', 'forces', 'show', 'speak', 'very', 'eloquently', 'Creation', 'Joan', 'Arcadia', 'look', 'how', 'show', 'came', 'together', 'idea', 'came', 'Hall', 'working', 'Judging', 'Amy', 'contemporary', 'take', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'Joan', 'Arcadia', 'Look', 'Season', 'One', 'substantial', '18-minute', 'overview', 'Hall', 'talks', 'how', 'picked', 'show', 'writers', 'casting', 'Girardi', 'family', 'actors', 'talk', 'characters', 'God', 'Gallery', 'six', 'reoccurring', 'incarnations', 'God', 'first', 'season', 'identifies', 'who', 'plays', 'why', 'God', 'enjoyable', 'extra', 'insight', 'casting', 'God.Finally', 'are', 'two', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'feature', 'little', 'bits', 'business', 'characters', 'was', 'rightly', 'cut.At', 'times', 'My', 'So', 'Called', 'Life', 'Joan', 'Arcadia', 'little', 'too', 'touchy', 'feely', 'liberal', 'own', 'good', 'surprisingly', ""n't"", 'try', 'ram', 'religion', 'throats', 'Ultimately', 'show', 'human', 'frailties', 'notions', 'tolerance', 'compassion', 'compelling', 'entertaining', 'way', 'comforting', 'dark', 'uncertain', 'times']",N/A

This wonderful allegorical series is attractive to all of us with a Higher Power (that's all of us).I was having lunch one day with three of my male friends, one of whom is RC, one Jewish, and one Muslim (and all devout and practicing their respecive faiths).  Interestingly, we discovered that we all watch this show (and we are adults and they are guys!!). Unlike some of the soppy tv shows of the Fifties, this one does not ram a particular 'religious' point of view down your throat.I believe 12th-steppers, Joseph Campbell fans and ""fallen-away"" Catholics-turned Episcopalian-Wiccan"" can find something to like about JOAN (I am all of the above). My 76-year old husband finally watched an episode with me and now he is hooked. My granddaugters ages 10-17 watch JOAN  faithfully (I'm getting the set for my 10-year old granddaughter for her birthday, she has a framed autographed photo of Amber hanging in her bedroom).Lest you think this is ""right-wing"" propaganda, let me assure you I am as ""left"" as they come and I identify with Joan. I am a feminist, a liberal, and I believe in women's rights, and I love JOAN. My granddaughters were very excited as we watched the Democtatic convention which nominated John Kerry and spotted Amber in the audience.We love you Amber and we want you to keep on keeping on!!",5,The Goddess is everywhere.......,1114214400,"04 23, 2005",2005,1464,"['JOAN', 'OF', 'ARCADIA', 'God', 'black', 'female', 'janitor', 'punk', 'youth', 'little', 'child', 'who', 'really', 'good', 'jump', 'rope', 'older', 'woman', 'bus', 'wonderful', 'allegorical', 'series', 'attractive', 'Higher', 'Power', '.I', 'was', 'having', 'lunch', 'one', 'day', 'three', 'male', 'friends', 'one', 'whom', 'RC', 'one', 'Jewish', 'one', 'Muslim', 'devout', 'practicing', 'respecive', 'faiths', 'Interestingly', 'discovered', 'watch', 'show', 'are', 'adults', 'are', 'guys', 'soppy', 'tv', 'shows', 'Fifties', 'one', 'not', 'ram', 'particular', ""'religious"", 'point', 'view', 'throat.I', 'believe', '12th-steppers', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'fans', 'fallen-away', 'Catholics-turned', 'Episcopalian-Wiccan', 'can', 'find', 'something', 'like', 'JOAN', 'am', 'above', '76-year', 'old', 'husband', 'finally', 'watched', 'episode', 'now', 'hooked', 'granddaugters', '10-17', 'watch', 'JOAN', 'faithfully', ""'m"", 'getting', 'set', '10-year', 'old', 'granddaughter', 'birthday', 'framed', 'autographed', 'photo', 'Amber', 'hanging', 'bedroom', '.Lest', 'think', 'right-wing', 'propaganda', 'let', 'assure', 'am', 'left', 'come', 'identify', 'Joan', 'am', 'feminist', 'liberal', 'believe', 'women', 'rights', 'love', 'JOAN', 'granddaughters', 'were', 'very', 'excited', 'watched', 'Democtatic', 'convention', 'nominated', 'John', 'Kerry', 'spotted', 'Amber', 'audience.We', 'love', 'Amber', 'want', 'keep', 'keeping']",N/A

Not one of THOSE people!), who say they like the show. It makes me wonder if I missed something -- am I wrong to like this show?If ""religious right"" means believing in the laws of the Bible, then I am a member. But a good TV show is a good TV show, regardless. One cannot expect something produced in Hollywood for a mass audience to cater to every doctrinal belief or whim of conservative Christians. I could quibble with the details, the allusions, the ""new age-y"" aspects of Joan of Arcadia (JoA), but in important respects it gets many things about God right.Beyond that, it is simply one of the best-written and -acted shows on TV. At least the first season is without compare. There was a falloff in consistency and a confusion of direction in the second season, but I can recommend season one with a whole heart.Oh, let me quibble about one thing. It is amazing how Amber Tamblyn can cry with seeming genuine-ness and zero effort. She's apparently a natural and gifted actress. In spite of the fact that she doesn't look like a Kate Moss anorexic model-type, I hope she has a long career in all sorts of movie and TV projects. But does she have to burst into tears in EVERY DANGED SHOW? That's a bit much.Teh supporting cast is great, and the fact that Joan's brother (who is played by a teen) has the hots for a classmate who is played by a woman of 29 is of endless amusement, and amazement, to me. Talk about robbing the cradle.The drama is gripping, the human conflict is real and convincingly painful, and this team pulled off 22 shows that stand up to repeated viewing without the quality flagging.

I'm right now watching the first season and my wife and I both love it.1) Yes, it is mostly a teen soap opera. But great situations are written and acted out to believability, making the viewer laugh out loud, cry and care for all the characters.2) Does this show state any absolutes? No. Does it state that there is ONE religious path to God? No. If you can deal with that then you can look past this HUGE missed point and still catch all the words of wisdom that are passed along. Things like, ""Think before you act because your actions have consequences,"" and ""I'm God. I don't exist because people believe in me, I simply exist."" These are things all teens should be exposed to in learning to be intelligent thinkers and in making the life decisions they are dealing with day-to-day.3) If the show had the ""messenger"" angel vs. God himself showing up to Joan then I think a lot of mainstream protestants wouldn't have a beef with the show. But it doesn't so I understand how this throws up red flags to some as promoting the wrong message of who God is and how he interacts with the world and people.4) Did I mention acting is well done, and the macro plots and sub-plots are well written and combined with great dialogue that it makes for some of the best TV out today?! Its is very well constructed and doesn't feel forced. Hats off to the writers and cast.5) And the best point of all is that not all the actors are models. They really look ""normal"" and we even care about them all. I love have it has a greater sense of ""reality"" by not making everyone super attractive like some shows feel they need to attempt to do.Overall, based on the first 8 episodes I've seen so far I'd love to own this and show it off to people. Now that I've found that it may be cancelled things have become a sad, sad situation.

What a great show!  Joan of Arcadia stars former soap actress Amber Tamblyn in the lead role of Joan Girardi, a 16-year-old high school student.  A typical teen, she just wants to fit in, be cool - and figure out how to reconcile that with the fact that God appears to her in different guises and has ""assignments"" for her.Joan of Arcadia is kind of like ""My So-Called Life"" meets a sassy ""Touched by an Angel.""  Season One focuses on Joan and her family as they deal with settling into the town of Arcadia and with the eldest son's accident which has left him paralyzed and wheelchair-bound.  Joan begins to ""see"" God, and as she gets to know Him better, He gives her assignments to do that have (usually) a positive effect on her life and those around her.  Delaying obedience or choosing to ignore His leading could and does have disastrous outcomes.The show brings up interesting questions about morality, faith and religion.  Joan's not some robot operating on blind faith.  Every step of the way she questions God's requests, and it's usually not until the end of the episode that she sees the impact of carrying out His wishes.  While she may believe in God (hey, she's talking to Him in person, after all!) she's not some overtly religious person.  Her father is unsure of where he stands on the whole faith issue, her mother has a love/hate relationship with God, and faith doesn't seem to matter too much to her siblings.The producer and creator of the show is Catholic, so Catholicism is the main religion you'll see in Joan of Arcadia.  The show tends to stay away from absolutes and focuses mainly on Joan's personal relationship with God and the effect it has on her family and friends as she acts upon that relationship.Religion aside, it's also got some great writing as it portrays a girl and her friends in typical high school situations.  If you've ever been a teenager (and who hasn't?), you can relate to the things Joan goes through.Overall, a great show, with great writing and music.

Amber Tamblyn's acting is amazing and the ensemble cast works well together as a family struggling to love each other despite trials. But about episode nine, the writing loses the magic. The plots become preachy and predictable, and Joan begins responding to god sarcastically even as she goes to great lengths to follow his directions, and that just doesn't make sense. One doesn't suffer discomfort, embarrassment and danger to follow the direction of someone one holds in contempt.Another  problem is the original police part of the plot was the dad struggling with moral issues at least somewhat related to Joan, not action scenes, which this director does poorly. Too bad they didn't stick with what they did well, rather than trying to be everything to every viewer.The final cause of the series falling apart midseason is that all the original conflict was basically wrapped up in the eighth episode: The son comes to terms with paralysis, Joan accepts her role as tool of god, Adam is cured, the father vanquishes all corruption and the mother solves the money issues by becoming a teacher.

889624,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B0007TKHKC,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[16, 16]","I like my movies dark and edgy, preferably Indies, which is why I am so surprised at my addiction to the TV series ""Joan Of Arcadia."" It's about as hard-boiled as ""Little House on the Prairie,"" which, oddly enough, I also watched avidly. Perhaps it is the excellent writing and outstanding cast which sets this program apart. All time favorites Joe Mantegna, (lots of noir under his belt), and Mary Steenburgen  team up with talented young Amber Tamblyn, (Joan), Jason Ritter, (son of John Ritter), and Michael Welch to play members of the Girardi family, who recently relocated to the small town of Arcadia.Joan Girardi, a pretty, (not glamorous...interesting), precocious teen, is experiencing adolescence Bigtime. She adores her family, BUT, they are a continual source of embarrassment. Her dad, Will Girardi, (Mantegna) is the town's new police chief, and a loving, moral man. He is not religious, however. Mom, Helen, (Steenburgen), works at the high school as an administrator, and is a spiritual, creative person. Handsome older brother, Kevin, (Ritter), is a recent paraplegic due to a terrible car crash. And younger brother Luke, (Welch) is a brilliant, but geeky guy.What's interesting here is the show's concept. Joan talks to God. On a daily basis. And He talks back. I know, sounds either zealous or corny...but it works! And I say this from the perspective of one who likes her entertainment separate from all things religious. As Joan grows up, physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, God advises her. This is not God of burning bush fame...nor  the omniscient booming voice from stage left. Joan's God is played by the average man/woman/girl/boy on the street. His voice and all-knowingness can come out of the mouth of the mailman, a bag lady or a cute guy. He appears in each episode and asks Joan to perform a seemingly innocuous task. The instructions are usually opaque, and Joan rarely sees their relevance. It is up to her to work out how her actions resonate within her family and the community at large. The point is that Joan is only asked to do something small, like join the chess club, or volunteer at a high school art show. The results usually have a far ranging impact. They act as a catalyst which trigger events in the lives of others. Joan's constant realization of how significant the ""little things"" one does are, teaches her that she doesn't have to save the world to make a difference. This idea is one of the many reasons Joan of Arcadia is so special.There is nothing preachy or saccharine-like about the program.  If I didn't know that God was in the cast, I wouldn't think the show had anything to do with Him at all. The show's approach is one accessible to people of all religions, although based on the Judeo-Christian tradition. Even agnostics would enjoy Joan and company -  the Girardi family certainly questions their beliefs and faith at times.Season One introduces the family as a unit and as individuals. They are all adjusting to life in a new town, new school, new job. God works with Joan on becoming an achiever, as opposed to an underachiever. Kevin has to cope with his rage and his disability. Wheelchair bound, he is no longer the top athlete he used to be, and his life has changed drastically. He hasn't really begun to internalize all this yet. Luke is an extremely gifted kid, but really geeky in an adorable way. He'll cope. Helen is struggling with her belief in God, after her sons traumatic accident. She was also a talented artist at one time, but has not painted in years and must deal with the reasons she stopped. And Will's work as chief cop is fascinating. There are mini-police dramas in almost every episode. He is caught up in some ethical dilemmas at work also, which also make for interesting watching. There is tremendous chemistry within the cast. Mantegna and Steenburgen make a believable and loving couple and the kids interact effortlessly, like siblings. Joan's best friend Grace Polk, (Becky Wahlstrom), and boyfriend Adam Rove, (Chris Marquette) are wonderful characters. There's not a dud in the group.I don't know a single person who thought they'd like this show when they heard about it. They watched, and they were happily surprised. Goes to show the importance of keeping an open mind!This DVD feature all 23 episodes on six discs. Deleted scenes are included from almost all episodes.

In the form of a cute teenage boy on the street, of an elderly woman volunteering at her school, or of someone on television, Joan keeps getting messages from God, telling her what she needs to do.It's about the last thing Joan needs. She's just moved to Arcadia, where her dad Will is the new police chief, and she and her geeky younger brother Luke have to get used to a new school. Meanwhile, Joan's older brother Kevin has his own struggles since becoming a paraplegic in a car wreck just after high school graduation -- struggles which have drastically changed the entire family.Although Joan doesn't understand the directions that God gives her, she does her best to obey...even when it causes misunderstandings and sometimes arguments between herself and those around her. Ultimately, she tends to see that whatever God tells her to do ends in a positive change reaction, such as when she befriends a classmate named Adam, whose father is a janitor for the police department, and knows of an impounded handicapped accessible car that could help Kevin put his life back together.This was, quite unexpectedly, one of my all-time favorite television shows.

When it went off the air, my family and I were very said but then we found out that they were coming out with Joan of Arcadia.  So we watched a few epoisodes and we fell in love with the characters.Joan's cynical attitude makes her an amazing character to watch, she's the kind of character that America hasn't seen since Heathers.  Joan struggles to make friends and make it through some rough scraps with her friends Grace and Adam, who she met when God told her to take AP classes.The family surrounding Joan is also an interesting one.  For example, you have Luke, the smart kid who over explains everything.  Then theirs Kevin, Joan's older brother who used to be a basketbal star but is now paralyzed after a car accident.  Then you have Joan's mother who in the middle of season one reveals that she likes to paint.  And then there's Joan's father who us cop with the Arcadia PD.  Both of ther parents don't believe in god so that deeps the storyline right there.The storylines are complex too.  For example in one epoisode god tells Joan to study for a history exam in which Joan of Arc is a subject. Joan studies and gets an A.  But being a 'C' student the teacher and principal think that she cheated.

889647,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B0007TKHKC,Todd Smith,"[2, 2]","Joan of Arcadia is an amazing show that didn't make it, because of bad marketing, and a bad time-slot. Think about this show, what do you know about it? A high school girl sees God and speaks to him, in his many different forms. That's it right? That's because that's how CBS choose to advertise this show, but it's so much more! Joan's father, Will (Joe Mantenga), is the Arcadia Chief of Police and there were many episode and background stories involving, crime, corruption, and the police. Her brother, Kevin (Jason Ritter), was in a horrible accident and is dealing with being paralyzed. That's just two of the many things about this show that you didn't know about. There are probably about ten other things I could mention, that could, alone, be the basis for a good TV show or film. Amber Tamblyn is amazing as Joan Girardi. Normally when you hear teen drama and young unknown cast, you expect the acting to be sub-par, but Tamblyn is exactly the opposite. She makes the show and gives energy and meaning to the other actors working with her. Take Chris Marquette, who plays her boyfriend, Adam Rove. I've seen him in many things and didn't like him. Working with Tamblyn makes all the difference for him here. He grows from a guest star into one of the most engaging and mysterious characters in the show! I cannot stress to you how good this show is and how it's so much more than what was advertised. There are so many stories and side angles, twists and turns, and while not a minor thing, Joan talking to God is not the focus of the show, many times it's just a scene or two, defiantly not the basis for the show. This show is the story of the Giardi family moving to a new location, following Kevin's accident, and dealing with all the struggles that come along with it and adolescents. It shows how there are still good people in this world, that not every teenager drinks, and while it sounds corny, watching it has actually cheered me up during some rough times I've had recently. It really is a great show and I can't possibly recommend it enough!",5,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,2065,"['Joan', 'Arcadia', 'amazing', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'bad', 'marketing', 'bad', 'time-slot', 'Think', 'show', 'what', 'do', 'know', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'sees', 'God', 'speaks', 'many', 'different', 'forms', 'right', 'how', 'CBS', 'choose', 'advertise', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Joan', 'father', 'Will', 'Joe', 'Mantenga', 'Arcadia', 'Chief', 'Police', 'were', 'many', 'episode', 'background', 'stories', 'involving', 'crime', 'corruption', 'police', 'brother', 'Kevin', 'Jason', 'Ritter', 'was', 'horrible', 'accident', 'dealing', 'being', 'paralyzed', 'just', 'two', 'many', 'things', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'about', 'are', 'probably', 'ten', 'other', 'things', 'could', 'mention', 'could', 'alone', 'be', 'basis', 'good', 'TV', 'show', 'film', 'Amber', 'Tamblyn', 'amazing', 'Joan', 'Girardi', 'Normally', 'when', 'hear', 'teen', 'drama', 'young', 'unknown', 'cast', 'expect', 'acting', 'be', 'sub-par', 'Tamblyn', 'exactly', 'opposite', 'show', 'energy', 'meaning', 'other', 'actors', 'working', 'Take', 'Chris', 'Marquette', 'who', 'boyfriend', 'Adam', 'Rove', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'Working', 'Tamblyn', 'difference', 'here', 'guest', 'star', 'one', 'most', 'engaging', 'mysterious', 'characters', 'show', 'can', 'not', 'stress', 'how', 'good', 'show', 'how', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'was', 'advertised', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'stories', 'side', 'angles', 'twists', 'turns', 'not', 'minor', 'thing', 'Joan', 'talking', 'God', 'not', 'focus', 'show', 'many', 'times', 'just', 'scene', 'two', 'defiantly', 'not', 'basis', 'show', 'show', 'story', 'Giardi', 'family', 'moving', 'new', 'location', 'following', 'Kevin', 'accident', 'dealing', 'struggles', 'come', 'adolescents', 'how', 'are', 'still', 'good', 'people', 'world', 'not', 'teenager', 'drinks', 'corny', 'watching', 'actually', 'cheered', 'up', 'rough', 'times', ""'ve"", 'had', 'recently', 'really', 'great', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'recommend', 'enough']",N/A

889650,A2QXO2X84ZIR0E,B0007TKHKC,"W. J. Mullen III ""Jack from Minnesota""","[7, 42]","I have seen all the episodes in this series several times each and it clearly has moments of brilliance despite the fact that the writers are scared to death of religion.  One has to watch an episode several times to really get all the messages out of it, but it is difficult to put up with writers who despise organized religion while speaking for God.The Gerardi family is supposed to be Catholic, but none of them go to Church unless someone dies on the show.  The father was raised Catholic, but is an avowed athiest despite the fact that his daugther is having daily visits from God and miraculous events occur in almost every episode.  Somehow the Mother is confused about her Faith and does not go to church either and the kids wouldn't even think of going to church.  This theme is too stupid for words to describe, but the show rebounds from a nosedive to the floor because the writers do a great job with the socialistic theme of the series of ""we all need to help one another in times of need in order to make the world a better place"".This is all a little disappointing, because the show could do a lot to get people to go Church and pray more, but instead, it potrays the Catholic priest as an unreligious intellectual and the ex-Nun, who appears in the second season, as a foul mouthed biker chick with tatoos, cigarettes and an addiction to coffee. God appears to Joan several times in every episode, but never mentions any of the Ten Commandments or the importance of going to Church. This has the effect of diminishing the stature of the show from being great like a ""Ben Hur"", ""The Ten Commnadments"" or even the Star Wars Series to the much lower level of a modern day ""God Knows Best"" version of the 1960's ""Father Knows Best"" TV series.My advice is to try to overlook the writers; 1)hostility toward Christianity and religion, and 2)preoccupation with the importance of sex in everyone's life to the detrimant of everything else, and instead, imagine a different kind of a God than the real God, and you should enjoy the show a great deal.The God of Joan of Arcadia asks for nothing from the world, but is always trying to either help people out of a difficult situation or teach us a lesson about life.  However, this God says he does not work miracles, because that would be unfair to those who didn't receive them.  Sounds totally rediculous if you consider all the miracles that Jesus worked, but this position enables the writers take a non-Christian approach to God.  In this way, the God of ""Joan of Arcadia"" never says anything about our sins or the possibility suffering eternal damnation if we misbehave. Instead, the purpuse of life is solely to fulfill our true nature, whatever that means for each person on Earth.This ""no miracles"" God makes the show too superficial in it's portrayal of the wonderous power of God.  We know for sure that the ""real"" God works many miracles in our time because of events such as the 66 documented miraculous healings that have occured in Lourdes, France from the sick and the lame being healed from contact with the water from the spring That St Bernadette discovered (as shown on the DVD movie; ""The Song of Bernadette"").In summary, The ""God Knows Best"" title is the best description of what the show is about.  Watch each episode several times or you will miss out on some of the harder to find messages from the God of Joan of Arcadia.  It's engaging, but quite a bit off target on its portrayal of the star of the series, God.",5,Joan of Arcadia is afraid of being religous but is about God,1112227200,"03 31, 2005",2005,3497,"['have', 'seen', 'episodes', 'series', 'several', 'times', 'clearly', 'moments', 'brilliance', 'fact', 'writers', 'are', 'scared', 'death', 'religion', 'One', 'watch', 'episode', 'several', 'times', 'really', 'get', 'messages', 'difficult', 'put', 'up', 'writers', 'who', 'despise', 'organized', 'religion', 'speaking', 'God.The', 'Gerardi', 'family', 'supposed', 'be', 'Catholic', 'none', 'go', 'Church', 'someone', 'show', 'father', 'was', 'raised', 'Catholic', 'avowed', 'athiest', 'fact', 'daugther', 'having', 'daily', 'visits', 'God', 'miraculous', 'events', 'occur', 'almost', 'episode', 'Somehow', 'Mother', 'confused', 'Faith', 'not', 'go', 'church', 'kids', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'going', 'church', 'theme', 'too', 'stupid', 'words', 'describe', 'show', 'nosedive', 'floor', 'writers', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'socialistic', 'theme', 'series', 'need', 'help', 'one', 'times', 'need', 'order', 'make', 'world', 'better', 'place', '.This', 'little', 'disappointing', 'show', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'get', 'people', 'go', 'Church', 'pray', 'more', 'instead', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'unreligious', 'intellectual', 'ex-Nun', 'who', 'second', 'season', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'biker', 'chick', 'tatoos', 'cigarettes', 'addiction', 'coffee', 'God', 'Joan', 'several', 'times', 'episode', 'never', 'mentions', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'importance', 'going', 'Church', 'effect', 'diminishing', 'stature', 'show', 'being', 'great', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'Ten', 'Commnadments', 'even', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Series', 'much', 'lower', 'level', 'modern', 'day', 'God', 'Knows', 'Best', 'version', '1960', 'Father', 'Knows', 'Best', 'TV', 'series.My', 'advice', 'try', 'overlook', 'writers', '1', 'hostility', 'Christianity', 'religion', '2', 'preoccupation', 'importance', 'sex', 'everyone', 'life', 'detrimant', 'everything', 'else', 'instead', 'imagine', 'different', 'kind', 'God', 'real', 'God', 'should', 'enjoy', 'show', 'great', 'deal.The', 'God', 'Joan', 'Arcadia', 'nothing', 'world', 'always', 'trying', 'either', 'help', 'people', 'difficult', 'situation', 'teach', 'lesson', 'life', 'However', 'God', 'not', 'work', 'miracles', 'would', 'be', 'unfair', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'receive', 'totally', 'rediculous', 'consider', 'miracles', 'Jesus', 'worked', 'position', 'writers', 'take', 'non-Christian', 'approach', 'God', 'way', 'God', 'Joan', 'Arcadia', 'never', 'anything', 'sins', 'possibility', 'suffering', 'eternal', 'damnation', 'misbehave', 'Instead', 'purpuse', 'life', 'solely', 'fulfill', 'true', 'nature', 'person', 'Earth.This', 'miracles', 'God', 'show', 'too', 'superficial', 'portrayal', 'wonderous', 'power', 'God', 'know', 'sure', 'real', 'God', 'many', 'miracles', 'time', 'events', 'such', '66', 'documented', 'miraculous', 'healings', 'have', 'occured', 'Lourdes', 'France', 'sick', 'lame', 'being', 'healed', 'contact', 'water', 'spring', 'St', 'Bernadette', 'discovered', 'shown', 'DVD', 'movie', 'Song', 'Bernadette', '.In', 'summary', 'God', 'Knows', 'Best', 'title', 'best', 'description', 'what', 'show', 'about', 'Watch', 'episode', 'several', 'times', 'will', 'miss', 'out', 'harder', 'find', 'messages', 'God', 'Joan', 'Arcadia', 'engaging', 'quite', 'bit', 'off', 'target', 'portrayal', 'star', 'series', 'God']",N/A

I quit watching the series after that.  It never moved or inspired me much anyhow, not like shows like ""Little House"", ""The Waltons"" or ""Touched by and Angel"".  I watched this entire DVD set which I rented from the video store through in one week....some episodes were excellent, some were good, some mediocre.  The downfall of this series was the tepid finale at the end of the season (the one where Joan contracts Lyme Disease) and the show never recovered after that.  The audience stayed away in droves in the second season and the show was cancelled.  This is probably the fault of Les Moonves (the CBS network president) who decides which direction the series are to go.  I'm tired of television teen age soap operas and shows with plotslines that continue on and are never resolved within an hour.  I know real life is not like this but I get enough of real life daily and I want some escapism now and then.  Les Moonves is not a good judge of direction.  I'm sorry the series was cancelled but it was inevitable the way it was headed.  It started off great but quickly went downhill.  I also find Amber Tamblyn annoying.  She doesn't make Joan a very likeable character.
