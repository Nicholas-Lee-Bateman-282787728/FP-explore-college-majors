I loved the first three seasons, the character development, humor and plots were all top drawer. Then came Season Four:  Katie McGrath's transformation into dark Morgana was a bit unconvincing, then  we had the inevitable loss of Uther, admittedly needed for Arthur to become the king he needs to be.Then came Season Five... I realize the Merlin takes a lot of artistic license with the Arthur legend, but: 1.  Camelot is barely touched upon. 2. The romance between Lancelot and Guinevere is barely even depicted, then Lancelot, Arthur's greatest knight, dies before he and Guinevere are even unfaithful.  3. No build-up of Excalibur as the sword of kings, it's not even talked about. 4. No search for the Holy Grail, or Galahad, for that matter. 5. No romance whatsoever between Arthur and Guinevere after all that build up for the first three seasons. A personal gripe is that Arthur never even becomes noble, he's still giving Merlin crap while he lays dying about not telling him he was a sorcerer even though it is obvious by this point that Merlin has saved him many times over.I realize that the producers got told in December that they had to wrap things up quickly, but come on, its like there is a whole season, or two missing! This show does not exactly give one closure, which is a pity because it had so many original ideas in it at one point. I get the feeling that the creators had a different plan to end the show before this rushed one was put in the works. Perhaps one day we'll be allowed to see how they originally planned to marry the modern Merlin/Smallville elements with the more traditional Arthur mythos someday, but this ending leaves one feeling a bit cheated.",3,Feels a Little Rushed,1370563200,"06 7, 2013",2013,1757,"['Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'am', 'as', 'big', 'Merlin', 'fan', 'anyone', 'there', 'loved', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'character', 'development', 'humor', 'plots', 'were', 'top', 'drawer', 'Then', 'came', 'Season', 'Four', 'Katie', 'McGrath', 'transformation', 'dark', 'Morgana', 'was', 'bit', 'unconvincing', 'then', 'had', 'inevitable', 'loss', 'Uther', 'admittedly', 'needed', 'Arthur', 'become', 'king', 'be.Then', 'came', 'Season', 'Five', 'realize', 'Merlin', 'lot', 'artistic', 'license', 'Arthur', 'legend', '1', 'Camelot', 'barely', 'touched', '2', 'romance', 'Lancelot', 'Guinevere', 'barely', 'even', 'depicted', 'then', 'Lancelot', 'Arthur', 'greatest', 'knight', 'Guinevere', 'are', 'even', 'unfaithful', '3', 'build-up', 'Excalibur', 'sword', 'kings', 'not', 'even', 'talked', '4', 'search', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'Galahad', 'matter', '5', 'romance', 'whatsoever', 'Arthur', 'Guinevere', 'build', 'up', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'personal', 'gripe', 'Arthur', 'never', 'even', 'noble', 'still', 'giving', 'Merlin', 'crap', 'dying', 'not', 'telling', 'was', 'sorcerer', 'even', 'obvious', 'point', 'Merlin', 'saved', 'many', 'times', 'over.I', 'realize', 'producers', 'got', 'told', 'December', 'had', 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'quickly', 'come', 'whole', 'season', 'two', 'missing', 'show', 'not', 'exactly', 'give', 'one', 'closure', 'pity', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'original', 'ideas', 'one', 'point', 'get', 'feeling', 'creators', 'had', 'different', 'plan', 'end', 'show', 'rushed', 'one', 'was', 'put', 'works', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'day', ""'ll"", 'be', 'allowed', 'see', 'how', 'originally', 'planned', 'marry', 'modern', 'Merlin/Smallville', 'elements', 'more', 'traditional', 'Arthur', 'mythos', 'someday', 'ending', 'one', 'feeling', 'bit', 'cheated']",N/A

When that change occurred I can't be certain. Not inappropriate considering Colin Morgan's 27 years old. He was a New Year's baby if you didn't know. Season 5 begins 3 years later. Uther is dead though his spirit is restless, and Arthur is King and married to Gweneviere. Morgana still haunts the shadows and Modred becomes a knight of Camelot. Arthur's Bane is Arthur himself sowing the seeds of his own downfall. Otherwise little seems to have changed. Merlin still lives in the room off Gaius' Lab, still wears the same clothes he was dressed in walking into Camelot, he's still Arthur's servant, and sorcery is still banned though with Modred on the scene more people are aware and able to practice it.One of the strengths of the series and BBC Productions in general is the attention to detail as seen in the hazing that goes on when Modred sets out with the knights on his first mission--he is asked to ride seated backward on his saddle and subjected to other ignominities. Such extras add a sense of reality to a show that also features dragons and unicorns.Morgana inhabits a dark tower not unlike those seen in Lord of the Rings though one suspects this one is CGI produced. This final season has a darker tone. Arthur is king so his carefree days are behind him though we see little of the tedious duties that must attend such a position. Plotlines centre around attempts to cause the king harm and Morgana appears at the centre of most. The relationship between Merlin and Arthur is still the central theme of the series.Arthurian Legend has been reworked and re-imagined countless times in the last millennial. This series is yet another in the long line. The mythic bits are all in place though the round table looks rather cramped in Pierrefonds Throne Room.

The bond between Merlin and Arthur is as strong as ever this series, and it is because of that bond that Merlin has to make some of the hardest decisions he has ever made. My only complaint about this season is the torment and weight of Merlin's destiny weighs him down quite heavily in this season. To see Colin Morgan sad always breaks my heart!Cannot tell you how much I adore Colin Morgan. He is truly a phenomenal actor. He brings so many layers to Merlin and provides you with so much emotion even with one look. He pulls you in! It is through Merlin this journey has been told and because of Colin Morgan that we fell in love with Merlin. Not only does he play Merlin, but he is able to play more than on character (i.e. Dragoon, and prepare yourself for one of his more hilarious characters to date) with such vitality and life! Katie McGrath is even more deliciously evil in this new series. To see her journey from the strong headed young woman from the 1st season to this bone chilling priestess who borders on the edge of madness is a true testament to Katie McGrath's genius. Bradley James plays Arthur with so much more drive this season, noble to the core you can see why Merlin would risk his life for Arthur. It's not beause of his destiny. It is because of his friend. Bradley James brings so much nuance and vulnerability to Arthur, yet under it all is steely resolve. It's little details that can be hard to miss, but he plays them so well you are truly caught up in the story. You believe in him. You believe in Arthur.Break out the tissues folks, cause the end is nigh.",5,Oh How I LOVE Merlin,1368144000,"05 10, 2013",2013,2110,"['season', 'Merlin', 'just', 'gettiing', 'better', 'better', 'writing', 'strong', 'acting', 'phenomenal', 'core', 'cast', 'have', 'grown', 'more', 'roles', 'turning', 'back', 'season', 'darkest', 'one', 'yet', 'stakes', 'are', 'even', 'higher', 'Ending', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'had', 'anticipated', 'have', 'been', 'Merlin', 'fan', 'beginning', 'are', 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'need', 'watch', 'final', 'epic', 'season', 'Tagging', 'characters', 'seeing', 'end', 'heartbreaking', 'so', 'fulfilling', 'bond', 'Merlin', 'Arthur', 'as', 'strong', 'ever', 'series', 'bond', 'Merlin', 'make', 'hardest', 'decisions', 'ever', 'made', 'only', 'complaint', 'season', 'torment', 'weight', 'Merlin', 'destiny', 'down', 'quite', 'heavily', 'season', 'see', 'Colin', 'Morgan', 'sad', 'always', 'breaks', 'heart', 'Can', 'not', 'tell', 'how', 'much', 'adore', 'Colin', 'Morgan', 'truly', 'phenomenal', 'actor', 'so', 'many', 'layers', 'Merlin', 'so', 'much', 'emotion', 'even', 'one', 'look', 'Merlin', 'journey', 'been', 'told', 'Colin', 'Morgan', 'fell', 'love', 'Merlin', 'Not', 'only', 'play', 'Merlin', 'able', 'play', 'more', 'character', 'i.e', 'Dragoon', 'prepare', 'one', 'more', 'hilarious', 'characters', 'date', 'such', 'vitality', 'life', 'Katie', 'McGrath', 'even', 'more', 'deliciously', 'evil', 'new', 'series', 'see', 'journey', 'strong', 'headed', 'young', 'woman', '1st', 'season', 'bone', 'chilling', 'priestess', 'who', 'edge', 'madness', 'true', 'testament', 'Katie', 'McGrath', 'genius', 'Bradley', 'James', 'Arthur', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'drive', 'season', 'noble', 'core', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Merlin', 'would', 'risk', 'life', 'Arthur', 'not', 'beause', 'destiny', 'friend', 'Bradley', 'James', 'so', 'much', 'nuance', 'vulnerability', 'Arthur', 'yet', 'steely', 'resolve', 'little', 'details', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'miss', 'so', 'well', 'are', 'truly', 'caught', 'up', 'story', 'believe', 'believe', 'Arthur.Break', 'tissues', 'folks', 'cause', 'end', 'nigh']",N/A
1622227,A2L64BVSRA9O4Z,B00B5A9FLY,Janalyn Robnett,"[3, 5]","First off a friendly warning:Disc 3 only has 3 eps on it, though it's labeled Episodes 9-12. Do not worry. The last disc, 4, has the missing ep... the final two parter, though it is labeled Episode 13. Have no clue how this happened, but it's the only thing I had a problem with.*SOME SPOILERS: BEWARE!*The final series of Merlin, in my opinion, left very few questions to be answered, namely the fate of the younger dragon Aithsu. Did Merlin ever go back to Camelot after sending Arthur's body on its way? (Of course there's really no spoiler here, we all know how the legend ends, it's just 'how' it ended for this show that's the mystery, and I'll keep it as such, with the exception of saying keep a box of Kleenex or even a paper towel by your side. I should have used a paper towel. The Kleenex did little to absorb all the tears I shed. Colin and Bradley's performances in their final scenes was what defines the word 'Bromance'. This relationship, above all others in the story line, was the central focus and remained so until the very end. Be prepared. If you are wrapped up in this series, you WILL sob your eyes out.)I have not been so involved in a television show in a very, VERY long time. It was the Bromance that drew me in and kept me riveted. As the producers/creators said, ""It is a love story"", but obviously between two clearly straight men. Merlin's love for Arthur is incredibly profound, Arthur's changing from a king who will not listen to his servant into a king that finally does, is as beautiful and breathtaking as the final battle scene when the sorcerer Dragoon makes his appearance. (For those who do not know who Dragoon is, watch the series from start to finish. Trust me, Colin has fun with this version of himself and it's quite evident. ;D)I am very sorry there will be no more of this story-line, but all good legends must come to an end, and sometimes it's as gut-wrenching an ending as it is satisfying (clue here: any show that brings me to a sobbing point is worthy of the 5 star rating I give it).Others who complain about the ending I know are only doing so because of the sorrow it caused. Others who have dissected this series and offered their complaints have missed certain elements within the plotting. I had the advantage of watching the series from start to finish within the span of 2 months, not five years, so I was able to keep fresh all the former hints and clues that were given to us. Watch it again straight through and you'll see what I mean.My only two complaints with the writing and acting was 1) Katie's bad habit of dropping her last syllables during her dialogues. Her acting was superb aside from that, but it was that little annoyance that, from the beginning,kept niggling at me and continued to do so throughout the series. Also her inability to maintain the British accent. She fell into and out of it more times than I would bother to count. Other than her speech/vocal mishaps, she played a fantastic Morgana. Her expressions were spot on, her sense of betrayal, even her compassion for Aithsu was compelling. Just wish she'd had a vocal coach to keep her on track.And 2) Gaius's constant pulling his knowledge of 'the Old Religion' out of his hat, as though he were a walking encyclopedia of all things mystical, and his constant refusal to accept Merlin's misgivings at his word. After 10 years of being at the boy's side, and having Merlin's 'funny feelings and suspicions' constantly verified, Gaius still cannot seem to grasp it that Merlin may just know what he's talking about. Arthur's (supposed) inability to do that is understandable... he has no idea Merlin is a sorcerer(Or does he??? see my view on this below), and looks upon him as just a servant. But Gaius? However, that being said, I love the character dearly as when he finally sees Merlin has grown up, he comes across as a father figure who doesn't want to see that happen. Those two things were my only complaints with the series. As for Arthur's being oblivious to Merlin's sorcery, I choose to believe on the side of 'plausible deniability'. He 'knows' Merlin is special, hence his constant need to keep his servant at his side, but if he allows himself to believe that Merlin is of magic he would be forced to deal with him. Yes, in the final magic reveal he shuns Merlin, but only for a while as he tries to wrap his head around the fact. Of course, this is all supposition on my part, nothing to really base it on fact, but I've been a victim of denial myself, so I keep wondering, does Arthur suspect anything at all about Merlin and is he just going into severe denial about it? It's possible. Then again, I'm a hopeless 'bromantic' and never want to see the boys at odds to the point of ripping their relationship apart. So I choose to believe for the best. It's my nature, sue me. ;DI will no doubt watch the entire series again and again. Bromances of this quality are hard to come by, and I seek them everywhere.

Unfortunately, it was the last of the 5 series that will be aired and to say I am disappointed is also an understatement.  So it is only natural that I would buy the last of the series on DVD.  Of course it goes well with my Merlin Series 1-4 DVDs.This season is the best of the group.  All the episodes are exciting and leaves you wanting it to go longer than the scheduled times for that episode.  Each of the 13 episodes tie in all the loose ends from previous seasons and it is done well.Although, I wanted to have Merlin reveal who he is to Arthur right from the get go in this series, it doesn't happen until later.  Too late if you ask me.  The first 2 episodes are action packed.  Episode 3 was terrific with Anthony Head coming back to this show.  Episode 4 and 10 brought back some previous actors/actresses. Episode 5, to me, was the turning point and fates were sealed.  It's one of my favorite episodes.  These fates will be shown in episodes 11-13.  The only sorta slow episodes were 6-9, but they tied in Morgana's/Gwen's parts according to the legend.  They are still great episodes.  The last three are where the real action comes in.  It completes the story line of the great legend of King Arthur and Camelot.  Note to oneself... store lots of Kleenex to use for the final episode.The entire cast should be very proud of their accomplishments because each and everyone of them delivered their best this season.  Colin Morgan (Merlin) has set the bar for one of the best young actors, worldwide...IMHO.  To say he is anything less than brilliant would be gross misjudgment on anyone's part.  To prove my point, Colin earned the best actor award for 2013 beating out all other highly favorite British actors.  An accomplishment that was not suppose to happen...but did.  He has come so far and it is so good to see someone who deserves the best get the best acknowledgement.  Colin IS the main reason I watched Merlin for 5 years straight.  Bradley James (Arthur) was magnificent and without his presence, the show wouldn't have reached it's full potential.  Katie McGrath was perfect to play the part of Morgana.  She really portrayed the evil, high priestess well.  Richard Wilson (Gaius), never better as he was in this series.  So glad to see they kept him a constant in the 5 series.  The newcomer, Alexander Vlahos (Mordred), was perfect in his role.  He (to me) was the one character who was so vital in this series and Alex contributed so much to his part.  Very talented and not to mention he has such stunning blue eyes.As I write this review, I realize that it should be on the product (DVD) itself, but for some reason, I feel it's more important to write about the series.  I will add that the DVD was shipped fast and I bought it at a good price ($29.99).  I definitely got my money's worth and then some.  There is no other show, TV or DVD I would rather watch.  I will continually watch Merlin, starting from Series 1, episode 1 all the way to Series 5, episode 13.  It never gets boring and re-watching it, I pick up more each time.  Classic legend with a relatively modern twist, makes this show the #1 show...ever (to me)!!I will miss this show deeply and pray that the cast will come back at some point to make a movie or a TV show...even if it is for one night.  The cast and crew from England made one terrific legend into a five year brilliant TV show.  BBC, you outdid yourself and I am so glad I was able to enjoy Merlin each airing week.Thank you Merlin cast, creators, producers, and all involved for making the last 5 years the best ever TV entertainment for this US citizen.Well done Merlin, well done.",5,"Merlin, Series 5 is the best of the series.",1368835200,"05 18, 2013",2013,3744,"['say', 'am', 'fan', 'show', 'understatement', 'down', 'best', 'show', 'there', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'last', '5', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'aired', 'say', 'am', 'disappointed', 'also', 'understatement', 'only', 'natural', 'would', 'buy', 'last', 'series', 'DVD', 'course', 'well', 'Merlin', 'Series', '1-4', 'DVDs.This', 'season', 'best', 'group', 'episodes', 'are', 'exciting', 'wanting', 'go', 'longer', 'scheduled', 'times', 'episode', '13', 'episodes', 'tie', 'loose', 'ends', 'previous', 'seasons', 'done', 'wanted', 'have', 'Merlin', 'reveal', 'who', 'Arthur', 'right', 'get', 'go', 'series', ""n't"", 'happen', 'later', 'Too', 'late', 'ask', 'first', '2', 'episodes', 'are', 'action', 'packed', 'Episode', '3', 'was', 'terrific', 'Anthony', 'Head', 'coming', 'back', 'show', '4', '10', 'brought', 'back', 'previous', 'actors/actresses', 'Episode', '5', 'was', 'turning', 'point', 'fates', 'were', 'sealed', 'one', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'fates', 'will', 'be', 'shown', 'episodes', '11-13', 'only', 'sorta', 'slow', 'episodes', 'were', '6-9', 'tied', ""Morgana's/Gwen"", 'parts', 'according', 'legend', 'are', 'still', 'great', 'episodes', 'last', 'three', 'are', 'where', 'real', 'action', 'story', 'line', 'great', 'legend', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Camelot', 'Note', 'oneself', 'store', 'lots', 'Kleenex', 'use', 'final', 'episode.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'should', 'be', 'very', 'proud', 'accomplishments', 'everyone', 'delivered', 'best', 'season', 'Colin', 'Morgan', 'Merlin', 'set', 'bar', 'one', 'best', 'young', 'actors', 'worldwide', 'IMHO', 'say', 'anything', 'less', 'brilliant', 'would', 'be', 'gross', 'misjudgment', 'anyone', 'part', 'prove', 'point', 'Colin', 'earned', 'best', 'actor', 'award', '2013', 'beating', 'other', 'highly', 'favorite', 'British', 'actors', 'accomplishment', 'was', 'not', 'suppose', 'happen', 'did', 'come', 'so', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'see', 'someone', 'who', 'best', 'get', 'best', 'acknowledgement', 'Colin', 'main', 'reason', 'watched', 'Merlin', '5', 'years', 'straight', 'Bradley', 'James', 'Arthur', 'was', 'magnificent', 'presence', 'show', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'reached', 'full', 'potential', 'Katie', 'McGrath', 'was', 'perfect', 'play', 'part', 'Morgana', 'really', 'portrayed', 'evil', 'high', 'priestess', 'well', 'Richard', 'Wilson', 'Gaius', 'never', 'better', 'was', 'series', 'So', 'glad', 'see', 'kept', 'constant', '5', 'series', 'newcomer', 'Alexander', 'Vlahos', 'Mordred', 'was', 'perfect', 'role', 'was', 'one', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'vital', 'series', 'Alex', 'contributed', 'so', 'much', 'part', 'Very', 'talented', 'not', 'mention', 'such', 'stunning', 'blue', 'eyes.As', 'write', 'review', 'realize', 'should', 'be', 'product', 'DVD', 'reason', 'feel', 'more', 'important', 'write', 'series', 'will', 'add', 'DVD', 'was', 'shipped', 'fast', 'bought', 'good', 'price', '29.99', 'definitely', 'got', 'money', 'worth', 'then', 'other', 'show', 'TV', 'DVD', 'would', 'rather', 'watch', 'will', 'continually', 'watch', 'Merlin', 'starting', 'Series', '1', 'episode', '1', 'way', 'Series', '5', 'episode', '13', 'never', 'boring', 're-watching', 'pick', 'up', 'more', 'time', 'Classic', 'legend', 'relatively', 'modern', 'twist', 'show', '1', 'show', 'ever', 'will', 'miss', 'show', 'deeply', 'pray', 'cast', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'point', 'make', 'movie', 'TV', 'show', 'even', 'one', 'night', 'cast', 'crew', 'England', 'made', 'one', 'terrific', 'legend', 'five', 'year', 'brilliant', 'TV', 'show', 'BBC', 'outdid', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'was', 'able', 'enjoy', 'Merlin', 'airing', 'week.Thank', 'Merlin', 'cast', 'creators', 'producers', 'involved', 'making', 'last', '5', 'years', 'best', 'ever', 'TV', 'entertainment', 'US', 'citizen.Well', 'done', 'Merlin', 'well', 'done']",N/A

Instead what we get is Arthur does not learn of Merlin's abilities until it's too late to appreciate them. Arthur only learns of them after he has been fatally wounded by Mordred.

Arthur has been king for 3 peaceful years, but now an expedition to the frozen lands of Ismere has lead to the disappearance of Gwaine, Percival & others, they have been captured by Morgana & Ruadan a fellow sorcerer but why? Arthur & Merlin must undertake a dangerous mission into the unknown to find out. Arthur & Merlin arrive in a village that has been attacked & a dying druid tells Merlin of 'Arthur's Bane' a battle where the young king will be slain. Morgana is trying to locate a mystical key sending her captives deep into the mines below the fortress she aims to find it at all costs. Arthur intends to travel through Queen Annis' lands in order not to be detected but is betrayed by Sefa - Guinevere's maid to her father Ruadan. Arthur & Merlin are trapped by Mordred, whom Merlin recognizes from the prophecy as being Arthur's killer. Merlin & Arthur are close to exhaustion, but are shown some kindness by Mordred but what is his motive? However Merlin & Arthur escape & get into the fortress via the mines & find that Gwaine after being attacked by his captors has been protected by a spirit called the Euchdag who is herself the Diamar, the 'Key' which Morgana is seeking. Mordred saves Arthur from Morgana's attempt to kill him & is rewarded with a Knighthood on returning to Camelot. Only one thing is now certain: The Great Trial for Albion has finally begun.Arthur rescues an old woman accused of sorcery, as she lays dying she gives him a horn with which he can summon the dead, unable to resist temptation he seizes the chance to speak to the person he misses most, his father, but the spirit world is a dark & dangerous place. His father berates him for marrying a servant girl, knighting ordinary young men on merit & his lack of cruelty to instill fear into his subjects. Arthur does not realize he has released his father's poltergeist, Uther starts to wreak havoc in Camelot - injuring Percival & trying to kill Guinevere. When Gauis tells Arthur that only he can return his father to the spirit world, he & Merlin set out to find Uther, when Uther finds & tries to kill Merlin, Merlin tells him that there has been magic at the heart of Camelot for years & just as Uther is about to tell Arthur about Merlin, Arthur blows the horn to return his father to the spirit world. Princess Mithian arrives in Camelot asking Arthur to help rescue her father King Rodor who is hiding from Odin the man who killed Uther, but Rodor is actually Odin's prisoner & the elderly woman who travels with Mithian is Morgana in disguise who is controlling Mithian with an enchanted bangle. Mithian is able to tell Merlin about Morgana whilst they are traveling but it's too late & Merlin is knocked out by Morgana. The knights leave Gaius & Gwaine to look after Merlin, while they carry on to their impending doom. With Arthur & his knights now captives it falls to Merlin & Gwaine to rescue them & then for Merlin to encourage Arthur to make peace with Odin. In the inky depths of an ancient pool, three soothsayers cast a dark judgement upon the king of Camelot. Osgar gives Arthur a rune mark from the Disir telling him that he must allow magic or face the consequences. Arthur & his men go to the caves to seek out the Disir, when they attack Mordred is fatally wounded trying to protect Arthur, who begs for the life of Mordred only to be told that in return for his life Arthur must allow magic to return to Camelot & he himself must embrace the Old Religion. Advised by Merlin who knows about the prophecy of the Druid boy & his part in Arthur's death tells Arthur to refuse which he does, but when they return to Camelot there is an unwelcome surprize waiting for Merlin on the steps of the castle.After visiting her father's grave with Elyan, Guinevere is captured by Morgana who then takes her to the Dark Tower which is haunted by ghostly visions & screams designed to send the prisoner mad. Arthur & his men set out to rescue her little knowing that one of them will not live to fight another day. When Guinevere returns to Camelot she seems to be a changed woman but why? Darkness steals into the very heart of Camelot as Morgana & her puppet queen hatch a sinister plan to murder the king. When Arthur is thrown from his horse his saddle has been tampered with & the stable hand Tyr is blamed & imprisoned, he tells Merlin that he knows who tampered with the saddle but they threatened to kill his mother if he talked. When he is found dead the following morning Arthur realizes he was wrong but his fate has already been sealed. Guinevere poisons Arthur's wine & there is little time for Merlin to save him, but Guinevere blames the poisoning on Merlin to divert suspicion from herself to ensure she will be made Queen in her own right after Arthur's death. Merlin has to escape from the cells to help the dying Arthur but can he get there in time.... In the dead of night a young druid boy seeks out Merlin begging him to go with him to his village to save his dying sister, Merlin leaves with Daegal but soon realizes he has made a terrible mistake, the boy has lead him into a trap laid by Morgana who poisons him leaving him to die a slow & painful death. Meanwhile Arthur is preparing to host the ruthless Sarrum of Amata hoping to form an alliance with him. Guinevere meets the Sarrum & makes a bargain with him, if he kills Arthur they could share power together, but the Sarrum has other ideas he plans to kill them both & take Camelot for himself. Daegal is guilt ridden & returns to the dying Merlin, after helping Merlin to recover the pair of them race back to Camelot to stop the assassination attempt. Merlin is more determined than ever to find out the cause of Guinevere's strange behavior. Guinevere meets Morgana in the dead of night, but unbeknown to them both they are being watched by Merlin & a disbelieving Arthur who now sees the reason for Guinevere's strange behavior. Emrys seeks out the Dochraid to find out how Morgana's spell can be broken, only to be told that the queen must enter the Cauldron of Arianrhod of her own will to have the spell broken. Arthur & Merlin drug Guinevere & head for the lake but are followed by a suspicious Mordred. When they reach the lake Merlin disappears but then reappears as the Dolma, asked by Arthur as to where Merlin is she replies 'Oh the gangly boy' saying she is holding him as surity, Arthur persuades Guinevere to enter the lake by getting her to remember their love for each other, the Dolma recites her incantations to lift the curse. A grateful Arthur can't thank her enough but the Dolma says all she wants in recognition is for Arthur to realize that magic can be used for good as well as evil, Mordred tells Merlin he knows the true identity of the Dolma but he will not tell Arthur.Morgana captures Alator to make him say who Emrys is. Merlin meets a woman who tells him The Great Battle is nearing & if he values his King he must meet her at the Temple of Erui. Merlin tells Gaius about her, to protect him Gaius tells Arthur there is a sorceress working in Camelot & where to find her. Mordred leads a party to capture her while she is meeting Merlin, but the pair escape. Morgana finds a note on Alator sent by Finna & sets out to find her. Merlin follows marks left on trees by Finna but is found by Percival & is made to stay in camp but Mordred lets him slip away during the night, he goes to meet Finna but they are ambushed & Merlin is hit by an arrow, they make it to an Old Watch Tower but are followed by Morgana, Finna sends Merlin to the roof for safety & gives him a small box telling him it will help him in the dark days to come & Alator said not to trust the Druid boy, she asks Merlin to give her his sword & to protect Merlin's identity she sacrifices her life. Merlin who is near death calls Kilgharrah who takes him to safety & heals his wound. Merlin & Gaius open the box which reveals a dreadful prophecy that will take place on the Plains of Camlann. Mordred finds himself torn between loyalty & love, but doesn't realize the path he is about to take will define Camelot forever.... Mordred meets Kara a fellow Druid with whom he was once in love, she is injured & needs his help. Merlin finds out about Kara but agrees to keep Mordred's secret. When Arthur & Merlin find her in the cave she tries to kill Arthur & is sentenced to death, Mordred pleads for mercy for her but Arthur refuses. Mordred helps Kara escape but they are soon recaptured & thrown into the cells & Kara is executed. Mordred's powers become all consuming & he escapes from his cell, Merlin fears this will tip him over the edge & the prophecy of the Druid boy killing Arthur will finally come true, sure enough Mordred goes to Morgana & in his anger reveals the true identity of Emrys.Morgana & Mordred are preparing for war to destroy Emrys, Arthur & Camelot once & for all. Morgana sends the Gean Canach to Camelot to rob Merlin of his powers. Merlin knows he cannot help Arthur without them so he tells him this time he cannot go into battle with him as he has another mission to fulfil, Arthur is amazed, just at the time he needs his friend the most he deserts him. Merlin knows that to regain his powers he must go to the Crystal Cave. So as Arthur leaves for Camlann, Merlin heads to the cave. Morgana finds out & follows him, when they get to the cave Morgana traps Merlin inside knocking him unconscious, when he wakes he sees an vision of his father who tells him not to give up hope. Merlin goes deeper into the cave, in one of the crystals he sees Morgana planning a surprize attack, & tells Arthur via a dream. The Crystal Cave restores his magic & he becomes more powerful than ever. Arthur tells his Knights the battle will help create the United Kingdoms. As the battle rages Arthur is heavily outnumbered, & it seems he is fighting a losing battle. When all seems lost a sorcerer suddenly appears & turns the battle in Arthur's favor, Arthur & Mordred duel, Mordred says 'You gave me no choice' as he wounds Arthur but Arthur has the strength to kill Mordred before passing out. When Arthur wakes Merlin is by his side & reveals it was him on the battlefield as the sorcerer, Arthur is hostile towards him, but advised by Gaius he allows Merlin to take him to the healing Lake of Avalon. On the journey Arthur comes to appreciate everything Merlin has ever done for him & sees him with a new found respect, even softening his attitude to magic. Morgana is pursuing them, thinking that at last her brother is dying she will now become the rightful Queen of Camelot, but Merlin has other ideas & kills her with Excalibur. Knowing that Arthur is dying Merlin calls Kilgharrah to take them to Avalon, but they are too late & Arthur dies in Merlin's arms. Kilgharrah tells Merlin that Arthur is the 'Once & Future King' & when Albion's needs are greatest he will rise again. Merlin sends Arthur's body to the island & returns Excalibur to the lake. The next time we see Emrys is in the present day as he passes the Lake of Avalon, Arthur's Eternal Resting place.Will we ever need Arthur & Merlin again? Only time will tell.",5,The Dawn of a New Golden Age ....

1622261,A4FX5YCJA630V,B00B5A9FLY,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[168, 180]","For casual fans of ""Merlin"", the fifth and final season may feel like a rousing send-off, with fine performances from its four leads, a host of returning characters, and a ""full circle"" quality to its finale that certainly doesn't pull any punches. For long-time fans that have gotten invested in the characters and storylines, it's an immensely frustrating experience, simply because said characters and storylines have been sacrificed for a tired old formula. With only two exceptions (Mordred and Queen Guinevere) there is nothing in this season - NOTHING - that the audience has not seen a million times before.""Merlin"" began as a prequel, intending to explore the lives of Arthur, Merlin, Morgana and Guinevere before they became their famous legendary selves. Essentially, it was to Arthurian legend whatSmallvillewas to the Superman mythos. Yet by this point, the show is not a prequel anymore, but a retelling: Arthur is king, Guinevere is queen, Morgana is their enemy and the Knights of the Round Table have been established. The prequel aspect of the show is over, yet despite all this, nothing has changed for our main character.The unique idea that these particular writers brought to the Arthurian source material is that Merlin has to keep his powers a secret due to a law banning magic throughout the kingdom, resulting in him protecting Arthur whilst pretending to be a lowly manservant. It worked well enough for the first two or so seasons, but by this point, it's been TEN in-show years since Merlin first came to Camelot, and Merlin is still not any closer to revealing his secret than he was at the very start of the show. The writers/producers' point-blank refusal to go ahead with this revelation and capitalize on all the character development and exciting new storylines that could have emerged from it is enough to make you tear your hair out in frustration.As it is, every single episode has only three variations. 1. A good character is kidnapped or injured, requiring Arthur, Merlin and the knights to ride out and rescue them. 2. An assassin infiltrates Camelot and tries to kill Arthur. 3. Morgana comes up with an evil plan (invariably based on either #1 or #2) only to be thwarted by Merlin's magic. I defy anyone to name me an episode this season that does not fall under one of these three categories. The plots are all EXACTLY THE SAME, and the only thing that changes are which parts the characters play (for instance, this season the role of the ""traitor in our midst"" goes to a brainwashed Guinevere - the year before it was Agravaine, and before that, Morgana).As well as being repetitive, the stagnant plots completely decimate any intelligence or momentum that these characters ever had. It's hard to see how somehow as foolish and oblivious as Arthur could ever be considered the greatest king of all time (especially since the show has spent the last five years demonstrating that it was Merlin - not Arthur - who was the real power behind the throne) or why we should consider Morgana any sort of dangerous adversary when her plans are so ridiculously convoluted and her motivation so obscure. Equally confusing is how Merlin is renowned as a great wizard. He spends a lot of his time saving Arthur's life and waiting on him hand-and-foot, but he does very little (virtually nothing in fact) to guide Arthur toward being a wise, just, tolerant king. In fact...SPOILERS...he ends up completely failing in what he initially set out to do. From the very start of this show it was stated repeatedly that several things were destined to happen: that Arthur would lift the ban on magic, that he would unite the kingdoms of Albion, and that he would rule over the Golden Age of Camelot with Merlin by his side as his wizardly advisor. Well...none of that ever happens. I repeat: IT NEVER HAPPENS. Arthur is killed by Mordred at the tender age of twenty-nine after reigning as king for only five short years, and without doing anything in that time that justifies his status as the Once and Future King. By the finale, all the prophecies, visions, symbols, and Arthurian references that promised Arthur and Merlin would build a better world together were summarily destroyed.Frankly, it's bizarre. How could the writers actually forget about their own central premise? What exactly has Merlin been striving for all these years? What was the point of any of it? It's hard not to end this show thinking that Merlin didn't just waste ten years of his life doing menial labour for a man who never treated him with much respect for the sake of a destiny that never actually happened. Perhaps Merlin should have been focusing on Guinevere all this time, for if anyone is going to legalize magic, unite the realm and reign over a peaceful kingdom, it's her. (And as an added bonus, she doesn't throw heavy objects at the back of his head while calling him a worthless idiot).As it is, Arthur *does* eventually find out that Merlin has magic - but by the time the confession is made, it's too late to do anything about it.END SPOILERSIt's not all bad, I suppose. Even though the actors are clearly ready to move on to greener pastures, they're still charismatic and likable enough to make you care about their characters. The casting agent knows what he/she is doing, as the addition of Alexander Vhalos to the ensemble was a master-stroke, taking over from Asa Butterfield as a now-teenaged Mordred. An ambiguous figure who sends Merlin into a paranoid frenzy over his supposed destiny to kill Arthur, this blue-eyed youth keeps the audience wondering as to his true loyalties and what - if anything - could induce him to kill a king he is seemingly in awe of.Several popular guest-stars return (Annis, Mithian, Balinor, Alator, Uther) for memorable reappearances, and though the other three leads (plus a now utterly superfluous Gaius) are caught in a state of never-ending inertia, Guinevere manages to step up in order to demonstrate how effective she is as Camelot's reigning Queen. The visual and technical aspects of the show (costuming, locations, set-design, special effects) are always beautifully rendered, and there are several highly emotional scenes, especially as the show begins to head toward its grand finale.Still, it's difficult not to get depressed by the possibilities that were squandered. Just imagine if Arthur had discovered Merlin's powers back in season three. There could have been a period of disbelief and recrimination, perhaps even exile. They could have reconciled in a time of trouble, and finally worked openly together as king and wizard. Merlin could have taken his well-earned place at the Round Table. The difficult task of reintegrating magic into the kingdom could have begun, with Morgana attempting to sabotage their efforts by aligning herself with those either skeptical of Arthur's intentions or unwilling to submit to his rule. There could have been a better exploration of Morgana's reasons for turning on Camelot (for some inexplicable reason, her abrupt switch from a compassionate young woman to a one-dimensional evil witch happens entirely off-screen) and more of Guinevere displaying her common sense and political savviness in uniting the kingdoms. The backgrounds of the knights could have been explored (I'm still astonished that they never capitalized on the story ofGwaine and the Loathly Lady), Arthur could have discovered the truth about his mother's death, and there could have been a complex and sophisticated conflict between sympathetic villains and morally ambiguous heroes, each portrayed in varying degrees of grey.Perhaps it still could have ended with tragedy - but at least we would have felt that Arthur and Merlin actually achieved something in their lifetimes instead of just treading water for ten years.",3,"""Even as

The plots are either outrageous or repetitive. The knights are men, but Arthur and Merlin still aren't. Arthur keeps talking about how he's such a great king, but he still seems like a man/boy grasping for maturity. Morgana is a joke. She does the same thing over and over and looks horrible. She's completely lacking in motivation and is nonsensical. The love story between Arthur and Guinevere is pretty much dead. There are some interesting pivot points surrounding magic, Mordred, and the story winding it's way around the legend.
