308132,AZSN1TO0JI87B,6302332729,A. Estes,"[0, 0]","Directed by Wes Craven, ""The People Under the Stairs"" is a fun and energetic, if a bit dated, horror flick that stars Brandon Quintin Adams (of ""The Mighty Ducks"" fame) as Fool, a street-smart and spunky 13 year-old kid living in the ghetto. When his mother falls ill and the evil landlord hits them with an eviction notice, he hatches a plan with a family friend (Ving Rhames) to break into the landlord's house and rob him of his riches. Unfortunately, Fool finds himself trapped in the house which turns out to be a fortress and uncovers a disturbing discovery about the inhabitants lurking in the basement.Full of stunning visuals, slapstick humor and colorful performances by its cast, ""The People Under the Stairs"" is perhaps the best '80s movie made in the '90s. Yeah, that's right, this movie looks and feels like something that belongs in the eighties, from the outfits the characters wear to the oddball hip-hop song that closes out the movie. It helps, though, that Craven is in top form with delivering some truly nightmarish visuals, aided by one great big set-piece in the house that the film spends ninety-five percent of its run-time within.Adams is a rarity in that he is a kid in a horror movie that isn't annoying. Quite the opposite, Fool is likable and real enough that you can't help but cheer him along as he gives the landlord some payback by throwing a brick at him -- ""Home Alone 2"" style -- and by sucker-punching his vicious guard-dog when it gets too close. The film is more fun than it is scary, with plenty of witty one-liners, awkward moments and situational humor. Horror fans will recognize Kelly Jo Minter (of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 5 - The Dream Child"" fame) in a supporting role and will get a kick out of the funhouse trip that ""The People Under the Stairs"" ultimately is. Despite looking even more dated than it should, it's a film that still holds up as simply a good time.",4,"""It's nice to see the rich folks got rats, too.""",1300492800,"03 19, 2011",2011,1917,"['Directed', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'People', 'Stairs', 'fun', 'energetic', 'bit', 'dated', 'horror', 'flick', 'Brandon', 'Quintin', 'Adams', 'Mighty', 'Ducks', 'fame', 'Fool', 'street-smart', 'spunky', '13', 'year-old', 'kid', 'living', 'ghetto', 'When', 'mother', 'ill', 'evil', 'landlord', 'eviction', 'notice', 'plan', 'family', 'friend', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'break', 'landlord', 'house', 'rob', 'riches', 'Unfortunately', 'Fool', 'trapped', 'house', 'out', 'be', 'fortress', 'uncovers', 'disturbing', 'discovery', 'inhabitants', 'lurking', 'basement.Full', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'colorful', 'performances', 'cast', 'People', 'Stairs', 'perhaps', 'best', ""'80s"", 'movie', 'made', ""'90s"", 'Yeah', 'right', 'movie', 'feels', 'something', 'eighties', 'outfits', 'characters', 'wear', 'oddball', 'hip-hop', 'song', 'out', 'movie', 'though', 'Craven', 'top', 'form', 'delivering', 'truly', 'nightmarish', 'visuals', 'aided', 'one', 'great', 'big', 'set-piece', 'house', 'film', 'ninety-five', 'percent', 'run-time', 'within.Adams', 'rarity', 'kid', 'horror', 'movie', ""n't"", 'annoying', 'opposite', 'Fool', 'likable', 'real', 'enough', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'cheer', 'along', 'landlord', 'payback', 'throwing', 'brick', 'Home', 'Alone', '2', 'style', 'sucker-punching', 'vicious', 'guard-dog', 'when', 'too', 'close', 'film', 'more', 'fun', 'scary', 'plenty', 'witty', 'one-liners', 'awkward', 'moments', 'situational', 'humor', 'Horror', 'fans', 'will', 'recognize', 'Kelly', 'Jo', 'Minter', 'A', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', '5', 'Dream', 'Child', 'fame', 'supporting', 'role', 'will', 'get', 'kick', 'funhouse', 'trip', 'People', 'Stairs', 'ultimately', 'looking', 'even', 'more', 'dated', 'should', 'film', 'still', 'up', 'as', 'simply', 'good', 'time']",N/A

Well, explain this to me: when a guy shoots his shotgun repeatedly like..100 times in a day, aren't there any people around the neighborhood to hear it loud enough and call the cops? Let's talk about the house for a second. Going inside the walls and seeing how everybody had so much room to roam around, it must be the Louvre, yes? It's obvious from the looks of the picture, Wes Craven got inspired by stories of families locking up children inside of the houses and never letting them out, sort of like Flowers in the Attic. What went wrong in The People Under the Stairs was that Wes decided to add more and more elements into the mix until it got out of hand. Then, it became a ridiculous picture shortly after Ving Rhames' character got killed about half hour mark. At that point, the movie was no longer interesting to watch. In a way, the film became manipulative, racist, stupid, over-the-top, and cartoonish.

308137,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,6302332729,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[1, 1]","I have been on a Wes Craven kick here recently. After having re-read the book on his career, I have started to pull out the old tapes I have of some of his films and re-watched them, after reading about them again in the ""Screams And Nightmares"" book. I originally saw this film when it was released in theaters in 1991, and saw only a few times since then. After re-discovering this film and seeing it for the first time in years and as an adult, I can honestly say that it was a nice surprise. The movie is a lot better and more fun than I remembered. This effort from Craven harkens back to his earlier 70's work like ""The Last House On The Left"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes"", mainly because it's a little seedier, darker, and more brutal than other stuff he has done in the 80's and today. Craven also wrote the script and it's a pretty tight and convincing tale he has weaved. The movie centers around a young boy of 13 named Fool(Brandon Adams),who is worried about the financial and living situation of his pverty stricken family who live in the slums in the ghetto. To make matters worse, the family's rent is due and his mother is very ill. To help his family, he agrees to go with his sister's boyfriend(played by Ving Rhames in a very early role),to attempt to rob the very wealthy landlords of the building they live in. The landlords are people who are only referred to as Man(Everett McGill), and Woman(Wendy Robie). Two very creepy and obviously unstable people. Once Fool and Ving are in the house, they quickly learn that once you get in, you aren't getting out. This sets off the real terror and fun of the film. Young Fool is stuck in these people's house of horror that come with booby traps, secret panels, hideaways, torture devices, a killer dog, and some really interesting occupants under the stairs. Who are they and what exactly is their story?. Well, I will let you find out when you see the film. All watched over by the deranged couple who call themselves ""Mommy"" and ""Daddy"". A.J. Langer, who plays their daughter was in""My So Called Life"" and ""Three Sisters"". She co-stars in the film as Alice, the unfortunate daughter of the loony couple locked up in the house and mistreated. This may be one of Craven's best and most overlooked films. The world he has created under the roof and within the halls of this house and thr story of the man and woman, is frighteningly real. He makes it seem as if you are in the house yourself running for your life and trying to get out. The details and the photography is so vivid and engrossing, it really makes it one of Wes' biggest audience participation type films. McGill and Robie are a sight to behold. McGill, known for baddie roles in films like ""Licence To Kill"" and ""Under Siege 2"", really makes a three dimensional character out of his role of ""Man"". Same goes with Robie in her role of ""Woman"". She really makes this lady cold and evil. They are a lot of fun to watch. I also heard rumors years ago that Wendy Robie was actually a man. I never thought much of it, but after seeing the film recently, I can see it. It may not be true, but I heard a rumor. See for yourself and come to your own conclusions. Brandon Adams is also a talented young kid who, like everyone else in the film, makes his character real. He was quite good. The films has a great balanc of dark and peverse humor that fits well. The movie also, and obviously, was hitting on some issues like the big man beating down the little people and the little people taking a stand. As well as how normal looking houses in nice, normal looking neighborhoods can sometimes house the most horiffic things that nobody would ever think. Wes did a really nice job with the characterization with this film, and it is one of the tighest films he has directed. It's not a classic, but it's a lost little film that sets out to do a job and gets the job done.",3,"""Don't Bruise Her Face....""",1072396800,"12 26, 2003",2003,3889,"['have', 'been', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'kick', 'here', 'recently', 'having', 're-read', 'book', 'career', 'have', 'started', 'pull', 'out', 'old', 'tapes', 'have', 'films', 're-watched', 'reading', 'again', 'Screams', 'Nightmares', 'book', 'originally', 'saw', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', '1991', 'saw', 'only', 'few', 'times', 'then', 're-discovering', 'film', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'years', 'adult', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'was', 'nice', 'surprise', 'movie', 'lot', 'better', 'more', 'fun', 'remembered', 'effort', 'Craven', 'back', 'earlier', '70', 'work', 'Last', 'House', 'Left', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'mainly', 'little', 'seedier', 'darker', 'more', 'brutal', 'other', 'stuff', 'done', '80', 'today', 'Craven', 'also', 'wrote', 'script', 'pretty', 'tight', 'convincing', 'tale', 'weaved', 'movie', 'centers', 'young', 'boy', '13', 'named', 'Fool', 'Brandon', 'Adams', 'who', 'worried', 'financial', 'living', 'situation', 'pverty', 'stricken', 'family', 'who', 'live', 'slums', 'ghetto', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'family', 'rent', 'due', 'mother', 'very', 'ill.', 'help', 'family', 'go', 'sister', 'boyfriend', 'played', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'very', 'early', 'role', 'attempt', 'rob', 'very', 'wealthy', 'landlords', 'building', 'live', 'landlords', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'only', 'referred', 'Man', 'Everett', 'McGill', 'Woman', 'Wendy', 'Robie', 'Two', 'very', 'creepy', 'obviously', 'unstable', 'people', 'Once', 'Fool', 'Ving', 'are', 'house', 'quickly', 'learn', 'once', 'get', 'are', ""n't"", 'getting', 'out', 'off', 'real', 'terror', 'fun', 'film', 'Young', 'Fool', 'stuck', 'people', 'house', 'horror', 'booby', 'traps', 'secret', 'panels', 'hideaways', 'torture', 'devices', 'killer', 'dog', 'really', 'interesting', 'occupants', 'stairs', 'Who', 'are', 'what', 'exactly', 'story', 'Well', 'will', 'let', 'find', 'out', 'when', 'see', 'film', 'watched', 'over', 'deranged', 'couple', 'who', 'call', 'Mommy', 'Daddy', 'A.J', 'Langer', 'who', 'daughter', 'was', 'My', 'So', 'Called', 'Life', 'Three', 'Sisters', 'film', 'Alice', 'unfortunate', 'daughter', 'loony', 'couple', 'locked', 'up', 'house', 'mistreated', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'Craven', 'best', 'most', 'overlooked', 'films', 'world', 'created', 'roof', 'halls', 'house', 'thr', 'story', 'man', 'woman', 'frighteningly', 'real', 'seem', 'are', 'house', 'running', 'life', 'trying', 'get', 'out', 'details', 'photography', 'so', 'vivid', 'engrossing', 'really', 'one', 'Wes', 'biggest', 'audience', 'participation', 'type', 'films', 'McGill', 'Robie', 'are', 'sight', 'behold', 'McGill', 'known', 'baddie', 'roles', 'films', 'Licence', 'Kill', 'Siege', '2', 'really', 'three', 'dimensional', 'character', 'role', 'Man', 'Same', 'Robie', 'role', 'Woman', 'really', 'lady', 'cold', 'evil', 'are', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'also', 'heard', 'rumors', 'years', 'ago', 'Wendy', 'Robie', 'was', 'actually', 'man', 'never', 'thought', 'much', 'seeing', 'film', 'recently', 'can', 'see', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'true', 'heard', 'rumor', 'See', 'come', 'own', 'conclusions', 'Brandon', 'Adams', 'also', 'talented', 'young', 'kid', 'who', 'everyone', 'else', 'film', 'character', 'real', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'films', 'great', 'balanc', 'dark', 'peverse', 'humor', 'well', 'movie', 'also', 'obviously', 'was', 'hitting', 'issues', 'big', 'man', 'beating', 'down', 'little', 'people', 'little', 'people', 'taking', 'stand', 'As', 'well', 'how', 'normal', 'looking', 'houses', 'nice', 'normal', 'looking', 'neighborhoods', 'can', 'sometimes', 'house', 'most', 'horiffic', 'things', 'nobody', 'would', 'ever', 'think', 'Wes', 'did', 'really', 'nice', 'job', 'characterization', 'film', 'one', 'tighest', 'films', 'directed', 'not', 'classic', 'lost', 'little', 'film', 'out', 'do', 'job', 'job', 'done']",N/A

I really want to say it's hilarious but... every time a supposed funny segment comes on the humor quickly switches into horror and I sit there totally shocked at the sudden change, haha.It's about a little boy who stumbles upon a house where a girl around his age is forced to be locked inside her bedroom thanks to her strict parents.  REALLY strict parents is probably an understatement- more like strict to the point of being obsessed with torturing their daughter and punishing her for even the *smallest* thing she does wrong (such as losing a dinner fork).  What a crazy, creepy family!Anyway the little boy learns more about this unusual house the more he explores it.  He has to battle dogs, traps, mazes, weird people... and his biggest obstacle being the parents who make it their own personal mission to capture the boy once they realize he's roaming the rooms of the house.  There's supposed to be a storyline involving gold coins that can be found in the house, but it's honestly unimportant and pointless.  It's about the boy becoming friends with the adorable girl and escaping the house alive... but it's sort of half-comedy, half-horror.Well eventually the boy stumbles across these people living INSIDE the walls of the house.  The people have even created pathways that lead to an assortment of other areas.  You know I used to have dreams ALL the time that my house was a huge, neverending maze... and I seriously wonder if the movie writers had the same dreams and were inspired to create this storyline as a result.Anyway the people/creatures living inside the walls are FAR from normal, but eventually they learn to side with the boy when it's discovered the parents are trying to capture and kill the boy.  It's funny that these ""wall creatures"" have flashlights, and many times we witness segments where several of them are standing next to each other like zombies and shining the flashlights through the cracks of the walls, haha.  It's definitely low budget.It's also very weird to me how *aggressive* the parents were in trying to kill the boy.  Actually I'm not really sure if the man was supposed to be the father or an older brother.  I can't remember if this was even explained.  Anyway he's definitely not shy about blowing holes through his walls in a weak attempt to blast the little boy to smithereens!  A little too graphic there!  Then again, it just adds more to the mystery of ""Is this comedy or horror?""  haha.Anyway I LOVE the mother character.  Her facial expressions were classic and she was totally believable in her demented character.Just a highly enjoyable, ultra bizarre, different type of film the People Under the Stairs is.",5,what a weird movie!,1328832000,"02 10, 2012",2012,2757,"['People', 'Stairs', 'one', 'strangest', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'really', 'want', 'say', 'hilarious', 'time', 'supposed', 'funny', 'segment', 'humor', 'quickly', 'horror', 'sit', 'totally', 'shocked', 'sudden', 'change', 'haha.It', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'house', 'where', 'girl', 'age', 'forced', 'be', 'locked', 'bedroom', 'thanks', 'strict', 'parents', 'REALLY', 'strict', 'parents', 'probably', 'understatement-', 'more', 'strict', 'point', 'being', 'obsessed', 'torturing', 'daughter', 'punishing', 'even', '*smallest*', 'thing', 'wrong', 'such', 'losing', 'dinner', 'fork', 'What', 'crazy', 'creepy', 'family', 'Anyway', 'little', 'boy', 'more', 'unusual', 'house', 'more', 'battle', 'dogs', 'traps', 'mazes', 'weird', 'people', 'biggest', 'obstacle', 'being', 'parents', 'who', 'make', 'own', 'personal', 'mission', 'capture', 'boy', 'realize', 'roaming', 'rooms', 'house', 'supposed', 'be', 'storyline', 'involving', 'gold', 'coins', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'house', 'honestly', 'unimportant', 'pointless', 'boy', 'becoming', 'friends', 'adorable', 'girl', 'escaping', 'house', 'alive', 'sort', 'half-comedy', 'half-horror.Well', 'eventually', 'boy', 'people', 'living', 'walls', 'house', 'people', 'have', 'even', 'created', 'pathways', 'lead', 'assortment', 'other', 'areas', 'know', 'used', 'have', 'dreams', 'time', 'house', 'was', 'huge', 'neverending', 'maze', 'seriously', 'wonder', 'movie', 'writers', 'had', 'same', 'dreams', 'were', 'inspired', 'create', 'storyline', 'result.Anyway', 'people/creatures', 'living', 'walls', 'are', 'FAR', 'normal', 'eventually', 'learn', 'side', 'boy', 'when', 'discovered', 'parents', 'are', 'trying', 'capture', 'kill', 'boy', 'funny', 'wall', 'creatures', 'have', 'flashlights', 'many', 'times', 'witness', 'segments', 'where', 'several', 'are', 'standing', 'next', 'other', 'zombies', 'shining', 'flashlights', 'cracks', 'walls', 'haha', 'definitely', 'low', 'budget.It', 'also', 'very', 'weird', 'how', 'parents', 'were', 'trying', 'kill', 'boy', 'Actually', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'man', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'father', 'older', 'brother', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'was', 'even', 'explained', 'Anyway', 'definitely', 'not', 'shy', 'blowing', 'holes', 'walls', 'weak', 'attempt', 'blast', 'little', 'boy', 'smithereens', 'little', 'too', 'graphic', 'there', 'Then', 'again', 'just', 'more', 'mystery', 'comedy', 'horror', 'haha.Anyway', 'LOVE', 'mother', 'character', 'facial', 'expressions', 'were', 'classic', 'was', 'totally', 'believable', 'demented', 'character.Just', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'ultra', 'bizarre', 'different', 'type', 'film', 'People', 'Stairs']",N/A

Wes Craven returns with another traditional fairy tale turned sour in THE PEOPLE UNDER THE STAIRS, from 1991. Craven lends an urban edge to the classics of storytelling, tying the deep-rooted theme of racial discrimination into the plot. The character archetypes of classic literature are ever present, as described in Fool's tarot card reading at the beginning of the film. Our villains are purposefully designed to be over-the-top and outrageously evil. They are sadists, cannibals, AND incestuous lovers. We ae told that each generation from this family became greedier and greedier, and with that greed, they grew more and more insane. The division between the rich white family and the poor, oppressed minorities is evident from the very beginning, but the racial discrimintation only grow more severe as the film presses onward. Everett McGill and Wendy Robie are truly a twisted pair as the crazed landlords, as they willingly lose themselves in the wild-eyed characters. Brandon Quintin Adams quickly wins over the audiences' effections as well as the smart-mouthed but courageous young hero, Fool. Although light on scares, THE PEOPLE UNDER THE STAIRS provides a thrilling adventure that falls closer in line with films like THE GOONIES than any of Craven's other pictures.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",4,The People Under the Stairs,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,1537,"['Fool', 'help', 'Leroy', 'break', 'landlord', 'creepy', 'mansion', 'order', 'help', 'momma', 'pay', 'rent', 'quickly', 'become', 'trapped', 'twisted', 'owners', 'other', 'lost', 'children', 'keep', 'locked', 'cellar', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'traditional', 'fairy', 'tale', 'turned', 'sour', 'THE', 'PEOPLE', 'UNDER', 'THE', 'STAIRS', '1991', 'Craven', 'urban', 'edge', 'classics', 'storytelling', 'tying', 'deep-rooted', 'theme', 'racial', 'discrimination', 'plot', 'character', 'archetypes', 'classic', 'literature', 'are', 'ever', 'present', 'described', 'Fool', 'tarot', 'card', 'reading', 'beginning', 'film', 'villains', 'are', 'purposefully', 'designed', 'be', 'over-the-top', 'outrageously', 'evil', 'are', 'sadists', 'cannibals', 'AND', 'incestuous', 'lovers', 'ae', 'told', 'generation', 'family', 'became', 'greedier', 'greedier', 'greed', 'grew', 'more', 'more', 'insane', 'division', 'rich', 'white', 'family', 'poor', 'oppressed', 'minorities', 'evident', 'very', 'beginning', 'racial', 'discrimintation', 'only', 'grow', 'more', 'severe', 'film', 'onward', 'Everett', 'McGill', 'Wendy', 'Robie', 'are', 'truly', 'twisted', 'pair', 'crazed', 'landlords', 'willingly', 'lose', 'wild-eyed', 'characters', 'Brandon', 'Quintin', 'Adams', 'quickly', 'audiences', 'effections', 'as', 'well', 'smart-mouthed', 'courageous', 'young', 'hero', 'Fool', 'light', 'scares', 'THE', 'PEOPLE', 'UNDER', 'THE', 'STAIRS', 'thrilling', 'adventure', 'closer', 'line', 'films', 'THE', 'GOONIES', 'Craven', 'other', 'pictures.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A

The gore is startling in a couple of scenes but isn't overpowering. The acting is outrageously over the top but also is endearing.Thirteen-year-old Fool (Brandon Ames) finds himself in a large suburban house owned by the two slum lords who are about to evict his sick mother and others from a ghetto tenement. He's in the house because he agreed to help two burglars make a score on treasure they heard was hidden there. Unfortunately for Fool (and his two grown-up accomplices), the owners are a brother and sister who call each other Mommy and Daddy. The man (Everett McGill) is a homicidal maniac who goes in for head-to-toe, studded, black leather bondage suits and pump action, single barrel shotguns. His sister (Wendy Robie) is just as looney and just as murderous, a screaming dominatrix. They also have a large vicious dog you wouldn't want to hand feed...that is, unless you had a hand to feed it.Fool finds hidden in the house a young girl, Alice, who he thinks is the pair's daughter. He also finds a number of boys, stolen when they were children and a few perhaps the product of Mommy and Daddy themselves. They've had their tongues cut off and ears chopped. Seems they were part of Mommy and Daddy's deep need for a perfect child...and when they didn't measure up, off with the tongues so they couldn't shout for help, and down they were put to the basement. They seem to have been fed by Daddy on the butchered parts of unfortunate salesmen and meter readers. It becomes a race for Fool to find a way out, rescue Alice and the people under the stairs, locate the treasure and see that Mommy and Daddy get what's coming to them. And after him is a relentless Daddy, with Mommy urging Daddy on.What makes this movie work for me are three things. First, the set-up in which the hero is a kid, and the horror is what has happened to other kids. Second, Brandon Adams' performance as Fool. He does an excellent job playing a fast-thinking, brave, resourceful young boy. And last, there is the Grand Guignol performances of Everett McGill and Wendy Robie. They are so over the top, so demented and so murderous that I never know whether to laugh or sit stunned at their doings.Once the premise is established and the characters are known, the movie does become one long set of narrow escapes through the house, and the house appears to have an infinite number of secret openings, narrow passages, sliding stair cases and slamming doors. Still, the movie works for me.The DVD's picture is very good; so's the sound.",4,"Funny, Over-The-Top Horror",1113868800,"04 19, 2005",2005,2629,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'gotten', 'kick', 'movie', 'story', 'line', 'original', 'least', 'so', 'gore', 'startling', 'couple', 'scenes', ""n't"", 'overpowering', 'acting', 'outrageously', 'top', 'also', 'endearing.Thirteen-year-old', 'Fool', 'Brandon', 'Ames', 'large', 'suburban', 'house', 'owned', 'two', 'slum', 'lords', 'who', 'are', 'evict', 'sick', 'mother', 'others', 'ghetto', 'tenement', 'house', 'agreed', 'help', 'two', 'burglars', 'make', 'score', 'treasure', 'heard', 'was', 'hidden', 'there', 'Unfortunately', 'Fool', 'two', 'grown-up', 'accomplices', 'owners', 'are', 'brother', 'sister', 'who', 'call', 'other', 'Mommy', 'Daddy', 'man', 'Everett', 'McGill', 'homicidal', 'maniac', 'who', 'head-to-toe', 'studded', 'black', 'leather', 'bondage', 'suits', 'pump', 'action', 'single', 'barrel', 'shotguns', 'sister', 'Wendy', 'Robie', 'just', 'looney', 'just', 'as', 'murderous', 'screaming', 'dominatrix', 'also', 'have', 'large', 'vicious', 'dog', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'hand', 'feed', 'had', 'hand', 'feed', 'it.Fool', 'finds', 'hidden', 'house', 'young', 'girl', 'Alice', 'who', 'pair', 'daughter', 'also', 'number', 'boys', 'stolen', 'when', 'were', 'children', 'few', 'perhaps', 'product', 'Mommy', 'Daddy', ""'ve"", 'had', 'tongues', 'cut', 'off', 'ears', 'chopped', 'were', 'part', 'Mommy', 'Daddy', 'deep', 'need', 'perfect', 'child', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'off', 'tongues', 'could', ""n't"", 'shout', 'help', 'were', 'put', 'basement', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'fed', 'Daddy', 'butchered', 'parts', 'unfortunate', 'salesmen', 'meter', 'readers', 'race', 'Fool', 'find', 'way', 'rescue', 'Alice', 'people', 'stairs', 'locate', 'treasure', 'see', 'Mommy', 'Daddy', 'get', 'what', 'coming', 'relentless', 'Daddy', 'Mommy', 'urging', 'Daddy', 'on.What', 'movie', 'work', 'are', 'three', 'things', 'First', 'set-up', 'hero', 'kid', 'horror', 'what', 'happened', 'other', 'kids', 'Second', 'Brandon', 'Adams', 'performance', 'Fool', 'excellent', 'job', 'playing', 'fast-thinking', 'brave', 'resourceful', 'young', 'boy', 'last', 'Grand', 'Guignol', 'performances', 'Everett', 'McGill', 'Wendy', 'Robie', 'are', 'so', 'top', 'so', 'demented', 'so', 'murderous', 'never', 'know', 'laugh', 'sit', 'stunned', 'doings.Once', 'premise', 'established', 'characters', 'are', 'known', 'movie', 'become', 'one', 'long', 'set', 'narrow', 'escapes', 'house', 'house', 'have', 'infinite', 'number', 'secret', 'openings', 'narrow', 'passages', 'sliding', 'stair', 'cases', 'slamming', 'doors', 'Still', 'movie', 'me.The', 'DVD', 'picture', 'very', 'good', 'sound']",N/A

When one of the family friends decides to pull off a Robin Hood stunt, stealing from a local wealthy family to give to the poor (namely themselves), Fool sees this as a quick solution to his family's problems.  However, Fool and his friends find that this is by no means an ""ordinary"" family, and succeeding in their task will be more difficult than they had imagined.This family has a dark secret that they have kept for quite some time now.  They have a hungry horde of cannibalistic boys locked in their basement, strange torture and security devices throughout the house, and an evil man-eating dog patrolling the house. The twisted wealthy owners of the house (Everett McGill and Wendy Robie) lock Fool in their home and are out for blood.  Fool must trust one girl, Alice (A.J. Langer), living in the house, in addition to one of these ill-treated boys in order to attempt his escape.This was a seemingly interesting premise that was executed poorly.  The plot was severely lacking, and the poor acting certainly didn't help.  The odd couple housing the boys in their basement become particularly irritating.  I understand that some of their actions were meant to be seen as humorous (...), but it wasn't pulled off very well.  All characters, with the one exception of Fool, were severely under-developed.  In addition, much of this film was extremely cliche.  For example, the wealthy couple who owns the home is approached by the police one night.  When they bring out hors deouvres and drinks for their interrogators, all seems forgotten and the police indulge themselves and then leave.  How could this nice, polite, high-society couple be involved in anything questionable?  Furthermore, why exactly these people have boys living under their stairs is never fully explained, they are merely there.Buy this movie only if you are a huge Wes Craven fan, but otherwise leave it for a lonesome Friday night rental.

308150,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6302332729,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 4]","The People Under the Stairs was written and directed by Wes Craven, a fact which necessarily raised my expectations going in.  It's a perfectly good horror film, but it just never really grabbed me by the throat.  The plot definitely has a few holes in it, and the ending holds no real surprises.  Beyond that, I expected a lot more blood and gore than I got, and even the heralded people under the stairs were not quite as bedraggled and horrific as I expected.  Basically, this is the type of film I would recommend to newbies taking their baby steps into horror.  It lets you dip your feet into the pool of gory goodness, but your full baptism will have to take place elsewhere.The unlikely hero of the story is Fool (Brandon Quintin Adams) a thirteen-year-old boy who agrees to take part in a burglary - not because he wants to, but because his mother needs a cancer operation and his entire family is about to be evicted from its home.  His sister's boyfriend has learned that the evil landlord has a collection of solid gold coins, and he talks Fool into helping him and his partner steal them.  The plan falls apart pretty quickly, and it's not too long before Fool is trapped in the house alongside the violent landlord (Daddy) and his evil sister (Mommy), a killer dog, a gaggle of freaks in the cellar, and - fortunately for him - a mysteriously helpful teenaged girl.  Escape seems impossible, as the whole house is designed to lock people in as well as out, and there are nifty little traps all over the place.  The only safe haven is between the walls, but Fool's not alone there, as one of the scary ""children"" from the cellar travels these narrow spaces - nor is he truly safe, for Daddy isn't afraid to shoot up the whole house whenever he hears movement behind a wall.Young Brandon Quintin Adams is likeable and effective as Fool, although he does more reacting than acting.  Twin Peaks' Everett McGill and Wendy Robie play Daddy and Mommy; between his death fetish and penchant for donning a black cat suit and her 1940s Fraulein hairstyle, they look as if they might have just crawled out of Hitler's bunker.  A. J. Langer fills the role of Alice, the innocent, abused daughter who has never been allowed outside the house.  She's quite good here, as is Sean Whalen as Roach, our first real contact with the motley crew of tortured individuals living like animals beneath the stairs.Craven supposedly got the idea for The People Under the Stairs after hearing a news report about some parents keeping their children locked up inside the house.  That might lead you to think this is a pretty serious movie, but it isn't.  There is almost a Home Alone feel to the action as Fool tries to outwit the psychotic Mommy and Daddy and find a way to escape.  I wouldn't agree with those who describe the film as a dark comedy, but it was certainly less disturbing and, thanks to McGill and Robie, more over-the-top than I expected.  I think it's also safe to say that the film doesn't offer much in the way of scares, either.  Horror fans will be entertained by The People Under the Stairs, but I daresay few of them will be genuinely impressed by this Wes Craven effort.",4,A Fool with someone else's gold may soon be dearly departed,1147996800,"05 19, 2006",2006,3181,"['People', 'Stairs', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'fact', 'necessarily', 'raised', 'expectations', 'going', 'perfectly', 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'just', 'never', 'really', 'grabbed', 'throat', 'plot', 'definitely', 'few', 'holes', 'ending', 'real', 'surprises', 'Beyond', 'expected', 'lot', 'more', 'blood', 'gore', 'got', 'even', 'heralded', 'people', 'stairs', 'were', 'not', 'quite', 'bedraggled', 'horrific', 'expected', 'Basically', 'type', 'film', 'would', 'recommend', 'newbies', 'taking', 'baby', 'steps', 'horror', 'dip', 'feet', 'pool', 'gory', 'goodness', 'full', 'baptism', 'will', 'have', 'take', 'place', 'elsewhere.The', 'unlikely', 'hero', 'story', 'Fool', 'Brandon', 'Quintin', 'Adams', 'thirteen-year-old', 'boy', 'who', 'take', 'part', 'burglary', 'not', 'mother', 'cancer', 'operation', 'entire', 'family', 'be', 'evicted', 'home', 'sister', 'boyfriend', 'learned', 'evil', 'landlord', 'collection', 'solid', 'gold', 'coins', 'Fool', 'helping', 'partner', 'steal', 'plan', 'apart', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'Fool', 'trapped', 'house', 'violent', 'landlord', 'Daddy', 'evil', 'sister', 'Mommy', 'killer', 'dog', 'gaggle', 'freaks', 'cellar', 'fortunately', 'mysteriously', 'helpful', 'teenaged', 'girl', 'Escape', 'impossible', 'whole', 'house', 'designed', 'lock', 'people', 'as', 'well', 'out', 'are', 'nifty', 'little', 'traps', 'place', 'only', 'safe', 'haven', 'walls', 'Fool', 'not', 'alone', 'there', 'one', 'scary', 'children', 'cellar', 'travels', 'narrow', 'spaces', 'truly', 'safe', 'Daddy', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'shoot', 'up', 'whole', 'house', 'whenever', 'movement', 'wall.Young', 'Brandon', 'Quintin', 'Adams', 'likeable', 'effective', 'Fool', 'more', 'reacting', 'acting', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'Everett', 'McGill', 'Wendy', 'Robie', 'play', 'Daddy', 'Mommy', 'death', 'fetish', 'penchant', 'donning', 'black', 'cat', 'suit', '1940s', 'Fraulein', 'hairstyle', 'look', 'might', 'have', 'just', 'crawled', 'out', 'Hitler', 'bunker', 'A.', 'J.', 'Langer', 'role', 'Alice', 'innocent', 'abused', 'daughter', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'allowed', 'house', 'quite', 'good', 'here', 'Sean', 'Whalen', 'Roach', 'first', 'real', 'contact', 'motley', 'crew', 'tortured', 'individuals', 'living', 'animals', 'beneath', 'stairs.Craven', 'supposedly', 'got', 'idea', 'People', 'Stairs', 'hearing', 'news', 'report', 'parents', 'keeping', 'children', 'locked', 'up', 'house', 'might', 'lead', 'think', 'pretty', 'serious', 'movie', ""n't"", 'almost', 'Home', 'Alone', 'feel', 'action', 'Fool', 'outwit', 'psychotic', 'Mommy', 'Daddy', 'find', 'way', 'escape', 'would', ""n't"", 'agree', 'who', 'describe', 'film', 'dark', 'comedy', 'was', 'certainly', 'less', 'disturbing', 'thanks', 'McGill', 'Robie', 'more', 'over-the-top', 'expected', 'think', 'also', 'safe', 'say', 'film', ""n't"", 'offer', 'much', 'way', 'scares', 'either', 'Horror', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'entertained', 'People', 'Stairs', 'daresay', 'few', 'will', 'be', 'genuinely', 'impressed', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'effort']",N/A
308151,A3GP4UPSW1OYXL,6302332729,"""Dark tower fan"" ""Aaron""","[1, 1]","Not the masterpeice you feel it could've been, but still a quality horror film from a director who has been shocking audiences for a very long, long time. And think about it- John Carpenter, Dario Argento; it is with sadness that i watch their recent films, for although I enjoy and love many of them, I am conscious of the fact that the movie's influence upon popular cinema- is very limited. Unlike their earlier works... Craven however, he has rejuvinated the horror genre at least three times throughout his career. 1st- Last House on the Left, (just think about all the films that owe credit to this movies release),  then in the 80's- A Nightmare on Elm Street (just think...) and then in the 90's with Scream (i dont even need to go into it). People Under the Stairs fits into the middle section of his career, at a time when his works, allthough competent- all seemed to fall short of what they could have been. This film unevenly mixes horror, humour, satire and social commentary in a manner which dosen't really work as a serious film, yet works very well as a horror romp... and for this i am most grateful. Some wonderful, scary ideas, backed by some wonderful design and some insane, wacky performances (Mother and Father are great, a post Twin Peeks Ma and Pa Kettle, who love home-made foods and stringing up carcasses in the basement)... A nice return for Craven, who again indulges in the horrors of the househould after a decade of working in his head and it is here that Craven succeeds best; Under the Stairs, in the last house on the left, in campervan- lost in a dessert where the hills have eyes and in Casey Becker's house as she quizzes for her life in Scream... Don't get me wrong, his other films are great, but it is his comentary of the savagery of family politics that works best and it is this that makes this film shine, even through the smoke...",4,cool movie,1111795200,"03 26, 2005",2005,1879,"['Not', 'masterpeice', 'feel', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'still', 'quality', 'horror', 'film', 'director', 'who', 'been', 'shocking', 'audiences', 'very', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'think', 'it-', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Dario', 'Argento', 'sadness', 'i', 'watch', 'recent', 'films', 'enjoy', 'love', 'many', 'am', 'conscious', 'fact', 'movie', 'influence', 'popular', 'cinema-', 'very', 'limited', 'earlier', 'works', 'Craven', 'however', 'rejuvinated', 'horror', 'genre', 'least', 'three', 'times', 'career', '1st-', 'Last', 'House', 'Left', 'just', 'think', 'films', 'owe', 'credit', 'movies', 'release', 'then', ""80's-"", 'A', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'just', 'think', 'then', '90', 'Scream', 'i', 'dont', 'even', 'need', 'go', 'People', 'Stairs', 'middle', 'section', 'career', 'time', 'when', 'works', 'competent-', 'seemed', 'fall', 'short', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'unevenly', 'mixes', 'horror', 'humour', 'satire', 'social', 'commentary', 'manner', 'dose', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'serious', 'film', 'yet', 'very', 'well', 'horror', 'romp', 'i', 'am', 'most', 'grateful', 'wonderful', 'scary', 'ideas', 'backed', 'wonderful', 'design', 'insane', 'wacky', 'performances', 'Mother', 'Father', 'are', 'great', 'post', 'Twin', 'Peeks', 'Ma', 'Pa', 'Kettle', 'who', 'love', 'home-made', 'foods', 'stringing', 'up', 'carcasses', 'basement', 'nice', 'return', 'Craven', 'who', 'again', 'horrors', 'househould', 'decade', 'working', 'head', 'here', 'Craven', 'best', 'Stairs', 'last', 'house', 'left', 'campervan-', 'lost', 'dessert', 'where', 'hills', 'have', 'eyes', 'Casey', 'Becker', 'house', 'life', 'Scream', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'other', 'films', 'are', 'great', 'comentary', 'savagery', 'family', 'politics', 'best', 'film', 'shine', 'even', 'smoke']",N/A
308152,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,6302332729,Dave. K,"[7, 7]","Wes Craven has had quite an odd career when you really break down his filmography. He's made so many classics, but he can also be very uneven and make some very weak movies. At times it seems Wes Craven is very hit or miss from one movie to the next. But his status as an Icon of the horror genre is very deserved for all he has done for horror movies. And in my opinion The People Under the Stairs is one of Craven's best of his career.It took Wes a long time before he broke the big time while Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes are seen as classics; they weren't mainstream when first released. It wasn't until 1984 with A Nightmare on Elm Street when he really had big success and after that it seemed he was hit or miss. Bad deals and studio politics did play a part in that, but here everything that makes Wes Craven great is presented in this movie.I love the idea of the backwoods killers only not set in the backwoods The People Under the Stairs is set in an average neighborhood over-looking the ghetto. This isn't a straight up horror movie it's also a comedy and even in some bizarre way a twisted fairy tale. While this isn't my favorite Craven movie hands down in my top 3 of his movies. Despite the comedy the movie is sort of creepy at times. And even in the comedic scenes that is also what elevates to being creepy.While a movie like The People Under the Stairs isn't the most realistic something like this is sort of possible. Craven apparently got the idea from reading a newspaper about a couple of people who kept their children locked up and never allowed to leave the house. And how many times how we heard about a person or in this case a couple who were seemingly normal that did these terrible things behind closed doors? So in that regard this movie is sort of possible, but of course it plays out differently in cinema.The script was written by Wes Craven and it was excellent; the characters are great even the ones with lesser screen time are well written for and his villains are great. Craven is a good writer for the most part the only problem that can be seen is some of his dialogue is dated based on certain words he uses, but I always thought Craven had a really good grasp on his characters when writing and I loved what he did here. He took a basic concept we've seen done so many times since the 60s and put a nice spin on the idea.As director Craven creates a great deal of suspense and tension and was able to mix the comedy in and not ruin the atmosphere of his movie, which often happens when a filmmaker tries to mix the two together. More often than not it breaks up the tension. A lot of the running time takes place inside a house and to Craven's credit he manages to always keep it interesting and never lets the pace slag at all. He creates a great nightmarish world with some excellent suspense and tension and again with some good touches of comedy that work very well in the movie.The cast is excellent and is filled with many known actors, while some of them you may not know by name, but you know by face. The acting is very solid. Some are serious and some a bit campy, it's tough in this kinda flick. Too serious might hurt, but too campy can as well, but the actors all are excellent and play their roles perfectly.Brandon Adams delivers an excellent performance as Fool, normally I dislike kids in horror movies I can actually count on one hand how many horror films with a child was in the lead that I felt worked. And Brandon Adams is one of those kids that is the exception. He delivers a solid performance and was quite likeable as well in the role of the young hero trapped in the house and trying to stay alive.The villains were played by Everett McGill credited only as Man and Wendy Robie credited only as Woman. Both actors are brilliant. They manage to be both really creepy and really funny at the same time and never once does it not work. They are a little silly at times and over the top, but it's very believable. I think the fact at times they're kinda funny and over the top only add to their creepiness. I really loved both performances and they both help really elevate this movie so much.A.J. Langer in I believe her first feature film is excellent as Alice. She's quite sympathetic and really provides a top notch performance and Ving Rhames delivers a fun performance as Leroy. Kelly Jo Minter best know to horror fans from A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child gives a solid performance as Ruby and Bill Cobbs is solid in the small role of Grandpa Booker. But it's Sean Whalen as Roach who simply steals the show.What I love about The People Under the Stairs is that there is actually a lot of social commentary and not just some horror flick. It deals with child abuse, racism and how the poor are treated in the United States. There really is a lot more happening than you might think. Some of this might be lost on some viewers, but The People Under the Stairs is a much smarter horror movie than its given credit for.While The People Under the Stairs is a popular flick in Craven's career I also feel it's quite often over-looked. I rarely give 5-stars, even movies I love and consider all time favorites I often give 4-stars. But I really think this movie is deserving of the 5-star treatment. It's a little creepy, a little funny and a strong social message delivered. The People Under the Stairs is Wes Craven at his best.",5,Classic Wes Craven flick,1201996800,"02 3, 2008",2008,5429,"['Wes', 'Craven', 'had', 'quite', 'odd', 'career', 'when', 'really', 'break',

Yes, at times it is hokey and humorous, but, it deals with very real and serious issues at it's core.  The story is a black boy who's just turned thirteen finds his family is soon to be evicted from their ghetto home.  He hooks up with two thieves who plan to rob his landlord and finds more than they bargained for in the process.  Child abduction, abuse and death.  People did not seem to understand stand this is about a child of thirteen who goes against the odds to fight and defeat abductors, abusers and more or less the criminally insane.  I love this film and think it was due time to deal with child abduction and abuse in the horror genre.  In truth, when speaking with the survivors of these crimes it is impossible to imagine it any other way but a horror story.  This film is generously made with subtitles in English for the deaf.

And miracle, this is also his best film, and one of his most personal! It's a fine and hard mixing of the most repulsive 'gore' images we can see on the screen, and the funniest humor we can hear. And it's also a social and racial pamphlet.Like in ""The last House on the Left"" or ""Hills have Eyes"", Craven describes a family of degenerate people, actually a white couple who get rich by using the misery of the L.A. black ghetto, who steal babies (the movie could have been titled ""Baby Snatchers"") and feed themselves and also their ferocious dog with human flesh. If I add that the 'couple' is actually a brother and his sister, the last ones of a generation of definitely insane folks, then you'll see better what I'm talking about. About to be evicted with his mother and sister, a young black boy from the ghetto (Brandon Quintin Adams, seen before in ""Moonwalker"" with Michael Jackson) gets in their big house, looking for gold coins, and soon gets trapped in what is to be a real fortress and hell. Unceasingly chased by the crazy, savage man of the house, in his leather suit, he manages to escape thanks to the help of two kids among those who were kidnapped (especially a young, still fresh girl). But he'll come back to rescue her and all the others rotting under the stairs, along with a real treasure... millions of dollars, taken from the ghetto.For the first - and last? - time, Craven includes a social message in a personal work and this makes this movie much better and interesting to the others. This exercise is perfectly conducted from the beginning to the ending, the humor never misses, neither does the horror. Once again, the mixing is very successful. The artistic result is a total success, along with the casting, including the powerful and too rare Everett McGill (""Quest for Fire""), hilarious as the nutcase among all - BURN IN HELL! -, Ving Rhames, two years before ""Pulp Fiction"", and Alice J. Langer - as Alice -, the main actress in John Carpenter's ""Escape from L.A."", four years later - remember, she's the President's rebel daughter.

Fools lives in the ghetto and has just found out his family is going to get evicted from their run down apartment. Fool is persuaded by family friend, Leroy, to sneak into the landlords' home (the husband/wife, etc) to steal a prized coin collection rumored to be in their home. Desperate to help save his Mother's life and the family from being thrown into the streets, Fool goes with Leroy and Leroy's friend, Spenser, to the house.Once they force their way into the house, they realize they got a lot more than they were looking for. After Spenser and Leroy are tragically killed, Fool tries to escape. Running for his life, he bumps into the landlords' daughter, Alice, a young abused girl full of nothing but scars and fear.

It is a mix of real horrors,dark comedy,and fairytale.When I got this movie my expectations were very high, and I was glad they weren't let down. I expected alot from this movie, I had heard it was VERY scary, and I'm into horror movies VERY MUCH!!! The bad reviews on here, don't listen to them, see the movie yourself!!!So Adam is a boy with his family living in some rundown tennant houses, his momma's dying of cancer. Well the kid hears about a treasure, locked up in the bottom of the basement of the house. The sad thing is no one ever comes out of this house alive, and unfortenately for him its not just a myth its the truth!!! Getting in may be a pain, but getting out is 10x's the fun!!! &quot;Hear no evil,speak no evil,and see no evil&quot; is a saying of the mother. Which holds to secret of the basement inhabitants.There is a girl hidden upstairs though, and is violently abused. The scenes where she is abused truely terrified me, my friend was asking what was wrong with me. Abusive scenes always get me like that. Violent abuse, and I mean angry abuse. And on top of those ingredients there is a man running screaming through the house shooting at the walls in a black&amp;spiked leather suite.The acting is wonderfull, especially for those playing the parents, they play the rules perfectly and make them two truely terrifying characters to see on flm!!!This is maybe an uneven film, but it is still one of the best horror movies I've come across.

At that point, the brother ""takes out"" whatever is wrong with the child and locks them in the basement.Our main character 'Fool', a 13 year old boy, who aids his friend Leroy(Ving Rhames) in an attempt to rob the house, which alos supposedly has a rare gold coin collection.  In fact, the brother-sister duo are also the landlords of the building that 'Fool' lives in and his family has just been made aware that they are to be evicted.Let's just say that Rhames and 'Fool' find a lot more in this house than they had anticipated.  There is a child running through the walls, constantly being chased by the Brother.  There is a locked cage in the cellar where all of the 'unwanted' children roam(and are fed flesh).  There is a killer dog.  And, there is a young girl named Alice, whom the brother-sister duo have yet to find anything wrong with.  Alice is played by a young AJ Langor(My-So-Called-Life) and gives a really good performance.I don't want to blow the ending or anything else that goes on in this movie, but I will say that this is very entertaining.

What I don't want to do is expose them to seriously frightening movies that will give them nightmares, or really gory movies, or movies with lots of swearing and sex.

I think it's a good introductory movie to the horror genre for tweens and teens because the plot revolves around two characters who are probably around 12 or 13 years old -- a girl and a boy.  So, kids this age should be able to relate to it.  There is a little bit of swearing, but not very much.  There is no sex/nudity -- although one of the &#34;evil&#34; characters gets dressed in a leather S&M outfit, it lends more creepiness to the movie than sensuality.

When a young boy accompanies two thiefs to the home of the slumlords who are about to evict him and his cancer-riddled mother, he finds greed is not the only evil that the insane duo possess.There's homicidal tendencies, domestic and child abuse, kidnapping and madness all around.  An extremely twisted view on religious zeal accompanying a leather bound-shotgun toting madman who shoots holes in the walls in vain attempts at killing a mute escapee!  A rottweiler who's very good at chewing arms, a very determined youth with more lives than a caffeinated cat and some very chilling scenes that must have done some serious psychological damage to the young actors in this movie.  Catch Ving Rhames (pre-Pulp Fiction and Rosewood) getting filleted and fed to the People Under the Stairs and pay close attention to the sadistic &quot;parents&quot; as their performances are what makes this such a funny and disturbing film.  Not a movie to watch under the influence of mind altering drugs or cough medicine with alcohol in it.

One thing he can't do inThe People Under the Stairs is make comedy out of an otherwise tense situation.It's Fool's (Brandon Adams) 13th birthday and his family is being evicted from their rat infested hell hole apartment in the Ghetto. The landlord's rules are: 3 days late=triple the rent and Fool's family cannot afford it. His sister, Ruby (Kelly Jo Minter) barely makes enough money for her kids, his mother is sick from a cancer that she cannot afford to get taken out and he has no job. But when Ruby's boyfriend, LeRoy (Ving Rhames) discovers a treasure map from the liquor store he and his buddy in crime Spencer (Jeremy Roberts) knocked over the previous sunday they get an idea to rob the house that the map belongs to.Things get stranger when the map actually belongs to the crazy landlords (Everett McGill and Wendy Robie) who seem to be more sinister than anything imaginable. With a couple of tricks up their sleeves, the trio sets out to the house using various disguises such as a plumber (Spencer) and a Little Bear Trooper (Fool). Only Spencer is allowed inside and even he doesn't make it out alive. Fool and LeRoy decide to sneak in after the couple leave their house, making LeRoy and Fool wonder if Spencer made it to the gold. The bad news is-while sneaking around and attempting to avoid the pet pitbull, Prince the landlords come home to find LeRoy searching the house. The man and woman assume that he's the only one there so they kill him and feed him to the &quot;people under the stairs&quot;. Meanwhile, Fool meets Alice (A.J. Langer) the &quot;daughter&quot; of the couple who's abused and all she'll do is sew little dolls of the people who have tried to get the money.After a daring escape from the house with gold coins given to Fool by Roach (Sean Whalen)-one of the people under the stairs who has escaped into the walls. Fool finds out that he has enough money to pay rent for a few years and for his mother's operation but there's one thing he's gotta do: go back to the house and rescue Alice.The People Under the Stairs is an enjoyable horror flick whether you like the dark humor or not is up to you. I personally found it out of place. A scene would get really scary but then a joke is flown in and destroys the atmosphere. There's some nice gore including LeRoy's upside-down gutting. There's also overtones to incest and S&amp;M but that's not what the film focuses on.RECCOMENDED TO FANS OF:Flowers in the Attic (1987)The Stepfather (1987)A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)CAST:Brandon Q.

Sitting around with a ton of snacks and a lot of joke cracking we were having the time of our lives. As Santa slipped into a bear like slumber sweating all over the title towel, Joe Bobb was giving us the drive in totals for The People Under the Stairs. It was a great time in life. From what we could remember it was a pretty cool movie. However when you're talking roughly 16 years ago it becomes a little hard to remember the specifics. Since that day it's always remained of of our back burner flicks just waiting to be finished off. We finally slid out of the tiny seat and told The People Under the Stairs to ""get down on the floor baby."" Once we did we can finally say that it was pretty damn good. Not really scary but truly entertaining on many levels.The People Under the Stairs a about a young kid named fool that's being evicted from his project apartment with his sister and dying mother. That's what it's like when you're living in the ghetto...hmmm nothing, what's wrong with these wops, that's gold! With very little hope he gets talked into robbing their overly wealthy landlords. What appears to be a simple job turns out to be something out of your worst nightmare...I wouldn't know where to begin. How about the beginning? So these landlords are just your regular uptight folks. These people are total nutjobs. They have a basement full of kids they've kidnapped over the years and spend their days terrorizing their daughter trapped in her bedroom.  The Dad is obsessed with killing one of the basement dwellers that's been crawling around through the walls, even chases him dressed in full leather dominatrix gear with a shotgun. Too bad perverted justice wasn't around back then. Long story short, the kid fool gets stuck in the house and devotes his efforts to saving the girl and people under the stairs. Oh by the way the landlords are brother and sister and totally want to watch a movie with their hand down their pants.Despite our bizarre distorted synopsis on the film, we fully advise you check The People Under the Stairs out. There's actually way to much going on in this flick to sum up in one paragraph. In the end it's a very satisfying demise for the bro and sis physco convention. When thinking back on the film it is somewhat disturbing but really more comical then anything else. Very similar to watching the elf. At first you're thinking, what's this? What's happening right now? Is that a midget in that stocking? Then all of a sudden your cracking up with your buddy for the next 20 years about it. It somewhere in that ball park. Plus getting to watch the brother lunatic run around in full leather garb was hilarious.

308195,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,6302332729,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[1, 1]","Wes Craven's The People Under the Stairs presents a unique idea for a horror film, but isn't quite able to pull it off. Phenomenal acting by the damnable ghetto owners and an unlikely 13-year-old hero add to the singularity, but the repetitious hunting through the walls of the prison-like house of horrors and the lack of victims makes the film more of an adventure than nail-biting horror. It's a fun little film, but not nearly ambitious enough to rank amongst the best of Craven's works.13-year-old Poindexter (Brandon Adams), nicknamed ""Fool"" by his friends, is looking for an uncomplicated way to help his family pay for rent and his mother's operation. When older accomplice Leroy (Ving Rhames) and his buddy Spenser hatch a plan to rob the house of the seldom seen family that owns the entire ghetto area where they all reside, Fool is in for more than he bargained.Dressed in electrician's garb, Spenser manages to con his way into the mysterious home of ""Mom"" and ""Dad"" to look around. But when he doesn't come back, Leroy and Fool break in - only to discover that the sadistic parents have stored away dozens of zombie-like tortured captives in their enormous basement. Battling Prince, the ravenous guard dog, the shotgun-toting Dad and the knife-wielding Mom proves to be the horror of a lifetime as Fool and a young prisoner girl named Alice struggle to escape the fortress of fright.The highlights of the film are Everett McGill and Wendy Robie who embody the terrifying Mom and Dad with such over-the-top depravity that audiences can't help but laugh and shiver. Dad parades around in bondage gear yelling up a storm, claims to serve a greater good, and allows little Alice to live provided she stays mute and blind to the atrocities around her. In his attempt to nab the perfect boy child, he keeps the lobotomized rejects locked away in the basement - but one has escaped, and now clambers through the crumbling walls of the house, aiding Fool and Alice in their plight. Mom is equally crazy, intent on killing anyone who sets foot in the house, and making sure the doorknobs are electrified, metal shutters are sealed, windows are barred and deadly booby-traps are in place.The People Under the Stairs is a combination of a grand escape adventure and a slasher flick; there are moments of bloody violence, but ultimately Craven has chosen to stick with suspense and mystery to keep the viewer glued to the edge of the seat. Although much of the film is too exaggerated and over-the-top to be scary, the suspense garnered from helpless children trying to elude armed adults is undeniably effective (think of Misery, in which James Caan is reduced to a defenseless nature). It may not stand out as the best of Wes Craven's body of horror films, but it's grown on audiences over the years - enough to coerce Hollywood into making a sequel, tentatively set for 2010.- Mike Massie",3,The People Under the Stairs Review from The Massie Twins,1225411200,"10 31, 2008",2008,2894,"['Wes', 'Craven', 'People', 'Stairs', 'unique', 'idea', 'horror', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'Phenomenal', 'acting', 'damnable', 'ghetto', 'owners', 'unlikely', '13-year-old', 'hero', 'add', 'singularity', 'repetitious', 'hunting', 'walls', 'prison-like', 'house', 'horrors', 'lack', 'victims', 'film', 'more', 'adventure', 'nail-biting', 'horror', 'fun', 'little', 'film', 'not', 'nearly', 'ambitious', 'enough', 'rank', 'best', 'Craven', 'works.13-year-old', 'Poindexter', 'Brandon', 'Adams', 'nicknamed', 'Fool', 'friends', 'looking', 'uncomplicated', 'way', 'help', 'family', 'pay', 'rent', 'mother', 'operation', 'When', 'older', 'accomplice', 'Leroy', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'buddy', 'Spenser', 'hatch', 'plan', 'rob', 'house', 'seldom', 'seen', 'family', 'entire', 'ghetto', 'area', 'where', 'reside', 'Fool', 'more', 'bargained.Dressed', 'electrician', 'garb', 'Spenser', 'con', 'way', 'mysterious', 'home', 'Mom', 'Dad', 'look', 'around', 'when', ""n't"", 'come', 'back', 'Leroy', 'Fool', 'break', 'only', 'discover', 'sadistic', 'parents', 'have', 'stored', 'away', 'dozens', 'zombie-like', 'tortured', 'captives', 'enormous', 'basement', 'Battling', 'Prince', 'ravenous', 'guard', 'dog', 'shotgun-toting', 'Dad', 'knife-wielding', 'Mom', 'be', 'horror', 'lifetime', 'Fool', 'young', 'prisoner', 'girl', 'named', 'Alice', 'struggle', 'escape', 'fortress', 'fright.The', 'highlights', 'film', 'are', 'Everett', 'McGill', 'Wendy', 'Robie', 'who', 'embody', 'terrifying', 'Mom', 'Dad', 'such', 'over-the-top', 'depravity', 'audiences', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'laugh', 'shiver', 'Dad', 'bondage', 'gear', 'yelling', 'up', 'storm', 'serve', 'greater', 'good', 'little', 'Alice', 'live', 'provided', 'mute', 'blind', 'atrocities', 'attempt', 'nab', 'perfect', 'boy', 'child', 'lobotomized', 'rejects', 'locked', 'away', 'basement', 'one', 'escaped', 'now', 'clambers', 'crumbling', 'walls', 'house', 'aiding', 'Fool', 'Alice', 'plight', 'Mom', 'equally', 'crazy', 'intent', 'killing', 'anyone', 'who', 'foot', 'house', 'making', 'sure', 'doorknobs', 'are', 'electrified', 'metal', 'shutters', 'are', 'sealed', 'windows', 'are', 'barred', 'deadly', 'booby-traps', 'are', 'place.The', 'People', 'Stairs', 'combination', 'grand', 'escape', 'adventure', 'slasher', 'flick', 'are', 'moments', 'bloody', 'violence', 'ultimately', 'Craven', 'chosen', 'stick', 'suspense', 'mystery', 'keep', 'viewer', 'glued', 'edge', 'seat', 'much', 'film', 'too', 'exaggerated', 'over-the-top', 'be', 'scary', 'suspense', 'garnered', 'helpless', 'children', 'trying', 'elude', 'armed', 'adults', 'undeniably', 'effective', 'think', 'Misery', 'James', 'Caan', 'reduced', 'defenseless', 'nature', 'may', 'not', 'stand', 'out', 'best', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'body', 'horror', 'films', 'grown', 'audiences', 'years', 'enough', 'coerce', 'Hollywood', 'making', 'sequel', 'tentatively', 'set', '2010.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",N/A

The people under the stairs are pale because they don't see the sun. This was made possible with make-up which is missing from necks and chest. The area inside the walls and under the stairs was unbelievably huge. The numbers of the people who live under the stairs was too large to be possible. The idea these were all kids they had adopted is unfathomable. The skeleton prop hanging up was cliche and fake looking. There are numerous plot problems and film continuity issues, i.e. position of items and blood from scene to scene.

Langer, Ving Rhames, Sean Whalen, Bill Cobbs, Kelly Jo Minter, Jeremy Roberts.Running Time:  102 minutesRated R for violence, language, and gore.""The People Under the Stairs"" is of the horror genre but is surprisingly funny. It is gory and bloody in the traditional Wes Craven sense but you will find a lot of this inexplicably humorous. It's almost a black comedy.  The tale is about a young African-American boy named Fool (Brandon Quintin Adams) who, along with some unworthy role-models (including Ving Rhames), breaks into the wrong house. He and his hapless friends break into the house of the local psychos, an odd couple who are rumored to have millions of dollars along with a valuable coin collection stashed away in their large suburban house. However, the would-be-thieves find that their intended victims are a little bit more than merely eccentric and that to say they have one or two skeletons in their closet would be an understatement.  The Fool and his friends choose the couple because they are the rich landlords over-pricing their families into the ghettos. However, the couple turns out to be completely insane and the young lads soon find themselves trapped in a suburban nightmare.  The house is a giant height-tech, booby-trapped prison and ""Mommy"" and ""Daddy"" (Wendy Robie and Everett McGill) have been spending years kidnapping children and ""cutting out the bits that were bad"" and locking them in the cellar when the boys displeased them. Only two of the children have escaped this fate: their only ""daughter"", an angelic girl named Alice (A.J. Lander), deeply scarred by a lifetime locked in hell, and a tongue less escapee from the cellar called Roach (Sean Whalen), who moves about the house inside the walls pursued by his ""Daddy"", wearing a gimp-costume and brandishing a shot-gun and blowing holes in the walls.Director Wes Craven (""A Nightmare on Elm Street"", ""Scream"") turns an innocent-looking suburban household into a frightening maze filled with traps, tunnels and secret passages. Add to this an absolutely terrifying killer dog, which good ole' Ma and Pa have been rearing on human flesh, and you have a recipe for real suspense. ""The People Under the Stairs"" has that certain feeling to it that makes you want to see it again to know what it was that made you feel that way. The film has a certain charm to it that provides the viewer that those involved had a good time it the film.  The two characters, McGill and Robie, give you the impression as such monsters that the real ones in the film, the kidnapped children, don't seem as threatening.  For a youngster, Adams pulls off the incredible in that he gives a good performance. He has an innocence to him that shows off his apparent sinful nature of a sneak and thief. The house is also cleverly designed and is actually scarier than some haunted house movies. It has hidden booby traps; deadly secrets in its walls, and its dark, never ending corridors have a real spooky nature towards them. Craven also develops some suspense in the beginning with the strange noises coming from inside the walls. It comes before you know what they actually are, and then gives several big pay-offs at the end. It was also good seeing a younger Ving Rhames in this movie as Fool's father.  This is one of the films where you have to develop a taste for. Like French food, it's good if you can actually develop a taste for it. It's not a film for everyone to enjoy. Craven fans should check this one out, as it demonstrates why he is the modern master of horror.",3,The People Under the Stairs  (1991),1136764800,"01 9, 2006",2006,3630,"['Director', 'Wes', 'CravenCast', 'Brandon', 'Quintin', 'Adams', 'Everett', 'McGill', 'Wendy', 'Robie', 'A.J', 'Langer', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'Sean', 'Whalen', 'Bill', 'Cobbs', 'Kelly', 'Jo', 'Minter', 'Jeremy', 'Roberts.Running', 'Time', '102', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'violence', 'language', 'gore', 'People', 'Stairs', 'horror', 'genre', 'surprisingly', 'funny', 'gory', 'bloody', 'traditional', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'sense', 'will', 'find', 'lot', 'inexplicably', 'humorous', 'almost', 'black', 'comedy', 'tale', 'young', 'African-American', 'boy', 'named', 'Fool', 'Brandon', 'Quintin', 'Adams', 'who', 'unworthy', 'role-models', 'including', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'wrong', 'house', 'hapless', 'break', 'house', 'local', 'psychos', 'odd', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'rumored', 'have', 'millions', 'dollars', 'valuable', 'coin', 'collection', 'stashed', 'away', 'large', 'suburban', 'house', 'However', 'would-be-thieves', 'find', 'intended', 'victims', 'are', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'merely', 'eccentric', 'say', 'have', 'one', 'two', 'skeletons', 'closet', 'would', 'be', 'understatement', 'Fool', 'friends', 'choose', 'couple', 'are', 'rich', 'landlords', 'over-pricing', 'families', 'ghettos', 'However', 'couple', 'out', 'be', 'completely', 'insane', 'young', 'lads', 'soon', 'find', 'trapped', 'suburban', 'nightmare', 'house', 'giant', 'height-tech', 'booby-trapped', 'prison', 'Mommy', 'Daddy', 'Wendy', 'Robie', 'Everett', 'McGill', 'have', 'been', 'spending', 'years', 'kidnapping', 'children', 'cutting', 'out', 'bits', 'were', 'bad', 'locking', 'cellar', 'when', 'boys', 'displeased', 'Only', 'two', 'children', 'have', 'escaped', 'fate', 'only', 'daughter', 'angelic', 'girl', 'named', 'Alice', 'A.J', 'Lander', 'deeply', 'scarred', 'lifetime', 'locked', 'hell', 'tongue', 'less', 'escapee', 'cellar', 'called', 'Roach', 'Sean', 'Whalen', 'who', 'house', 'walls', 'pursued', 'Daddy', 'wearing', 'gimp-costume', 'brandishing', 'shot-gun', 'blowing', 'holes', 'walls.Director', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'Scream', 'innocent-looking', 'suburban', 'household', 'frightening', 'maze', 'filled', 'traps', 'tunnels', 'secret', 'passages', 'Add', 'absolutely', 'terrifying', 'killer', 'dog', 'good', 'ole', 'Ma', 'Pa', 'have', 'been', 'rearing', 'human', 'flesh', 'have', 'recipe', 'real', 'suspense', 'People', 'Stairs', 'certain', 'feeling', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'made', 'feel', 'way', 'film', 'certain', 'charm', 'viewer', 'involved', 'had', 'good', 'time', 'film', 'two', 'characters', 'McGill', 'Robie', 'give', 'impression', 'such', 'monsters', 'real', 'ones', 'film', 'kidnapped', 'children', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'threatening', 'youngster', 'Adams', 'incredible', 'good', 'performance', 'innocence', 'apparent', 'sinful', 'nature', 'sneak', 'thief', 'house', 'also', 'cleverly', 'designed', 'actually', 'scarier', 'haunted', 'house', 'movies', 'hidden', 'booby', 'traps', 'deadly', 'walls', 'dark', 'never', 'ending', 'corridors', 'have', 'real', 'spooky', 'nature', 'Craven', 'also', 'suspense', 'beginning', 'strange', 'noises', 'coming', 'walls', 'know', 'what', 'actually', 'are', 'then', 'several', 'big', 'pay-offs', 'end', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'seeing', 'younger', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'movie', 'Fool', 'father', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'have', 'develop', 'taste', 'French', 'food', 'good', 'can', 'actually', 'develop', 'taste', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'enjoy', 'Craven', 'fans', 'should', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'why', 'modern', 'master', 'horror']",N/A

A lovely little story about a young man who breaks into his landlords mansion, only to find that he and his wife are crazy. They have a habit of punishing their children, by cutting out the bad parts and holding them prisoner under the basement stairs. It's a very original story, unfortunately the cast is so bad, that the film becomes more of a farce than a horror film. Brandon Adams plays Fool, the lead, and he is just plain bad. The parents on the other hand were completely hilarious, but I'm not sure it was done on purpose. There are a few funny lines thrown in, but I found them to be hilarious throughout the entire movie.

In it Dexter, who friends call Fool, lives in poverty, with his sick mother. A few of his older ""friends"" tell him the only way they can get some money is to steal it. So he goes with them to a house of two rich people who own all the homes in the ghetto where Dexter lives. But when they arrive they find out how sick these two are. The house has a full lock and electrical system to trap them inside. There have been dozens of people trapped inside for a long time. They are kept under the stairs. Can Dexter survive, and save the young girl Alice, as well as the people under the stairs?This film reminds me a lot of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, as how people come to a house, only to be met by a crazy murderous family. While Texas is more serious, and scarier, this film is very campy, and has a lot of funny moments. Wes Craven surely knows how to direct a horror film, as he does here. If your a fan of horror, or camp, I'd recommend this. You should definitely watch with friends, as you will be laughing a lot.
