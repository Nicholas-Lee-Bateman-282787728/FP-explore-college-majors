1053381,A9TG2NFA614S9,B000N4RAR4,John F. Rooney,"[1, 3]","""What Dreams May Come"" (1998) for most of its length is a downer. Be prepared for some melancholy stuff. There are at least two Robin Williams personas; one is the comic, another is the tear-jerker sentimentalist. We certainly don't get the comic in this one. Robin, a doctor, loses his two children in an automobile accident. He was able to endure the grieving process and go on with his life, but his wife was not. They were soul mates. From their first meeting theirs was a magic love affair. But from the start viewers had the feeling that they, the couple, and yes, the viewers were going to have bad luck. The morning his two children took off on the fateful trip, we had the feeling tragedy was impending.Then Robin gets killed in an automobile accident, and he goes to Heaven. It's a beautiful place with impressionistic paints and colors that are spectacular. They are visualizations of his wife's work. The movie has really stunning special effects with surreal scenes that make you feel as if paintings have come to life. We see a ghastly and distressing Hell that may shake you up. I saw this in Blue-ray which added to the experience.In Heaven Robin is given two guides at different times, one Cuba Gooding, Jr. and the other played by Rosalind Chao. His wife is distraught over first the death of the children and then her husband.The trouble is that the two children are perfect, and Robin, against all odds seeks to do the impossible while in Heaven. As viewers our journey through the glorious world of special effects is memorable, but somehow we may have the feeling we've been taken and we've undergone some manipulation. The movie is spiritual without being religious. If you've seen this movie once, I don't think you'll want to return to it.I'll be reviewing ""Patch Adams"" shortly.",3,"""You're in Heaven""",1248912000,"07 30, 2009",2009,1804,"['What', 'Dreams', 'May', 'Come', '1998', 'most', 'length', 'downer', 'Be', 'prepared', 'melancholy', 'stuff', 'are', 'least', 'two', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'personas', 'one', 'comic', 'tear-jerker', 'sentimentalist', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'comic', 'one', 'Robin', 'doctor', 'two', 'children', 'automobile', 'accident', 'was', 'able', 'endure', 'grieving', 'process', 'go', 'life', 'wife', 'was', 'not', 'were', 'soul', 'mates', 'first', 'meeting', 'theirs', 'was', 'magic', 'love', 'affair', 'start', 'viewers', 'had', 'feeling', 'couple', 'yes', 'viewers', 'were', 'going', 'have', 'bad', 'luck', 'morning', 'two', 'children', 'took', 'off', 'fateful', 'trip', 'had', 'feeling', 'tragedy', 'was', 'impending.Then', 'Robin', 'killed', 'automobile', 'accident', 'Heaven', 'beautiful', 'place', 'impressionistic', 'paints', 'colors', 'are', 'spectacular', 'are', 'visualizations', 'wife', 'work', 'movie', 'really', 'stunning', 'special', 'effects', 'surreal', 'scenes', 'make', 'feel', 'paintings', 'have', 'come', 'life', 'see', 'ghastly', 'distressing', 'Hell', 'may', 'shake', 'up', 'saw', 'Blue-ray', 'added', 'experience.In', 'Heaven', 'Robin', 'given', 'two', 'guides', 'different', 'times', 'one', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'other', 'played', 'Rosalind', 'Chao', 'wife', 'distraught', 'first', 'death', 'children', 'then', 'husband.The', 'trouble', 'two', 'children', 'are', 'perfect', 'Robin', 'odds', 'do', 'impossible', 'while', 'Heaven', 'viewers', 'journey', 'glorious', 'world', 'special', 'effects', 'memorable', 'somehow', 'may', 'have', 'feeling', ""'ve"", 'been', 'taken', ""'ve"", 'undergone', 'manipulation', 'movie', 'spiritual', 'being', 'religious', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'once', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'want', 'return', 'it.I', ""'ll"", 'be', 'reviewing', 'Patch', 'Adams', 'shortly']",N/A
