Jones,"[1, 1]","Terrific fun cult film about a night at the drive in where Hard Rock Zombies is screening, what you haven't seen Hard Rock Zombies?No need to get that film because the best of er being the worst of is shown in this film so you really are getting two films in one.I thought this film was a fun nostalgic trip and got a real kick out of it, it made me laugh.Highlights being: The two elderly ladies, one with a hearing problem ( I think she is the elderly lady in The Wedding Singer) trying to make out the films plot.The overweight family who use the night at the drive in as a pig out night.The scene where some guy swaps the sound on screen to a couple making out (this scene is such a laugh) plus others but what's up on the screen is funny too as Hard Rock Zombies is made fun of here and fittingly so.Give it a watch, you'll either love it or hate it.I love it, it's fun.",5,"The Tackiest Drive-In Movie Ever Made, Making It One Of The Best",1299542400,"03 8, 2011",2011,875,"['Terrific', 'fun', 'cult', 'film', 'night', 'drive', 'where', 'Hard', 'Rock', 'Zombies', 'screening', 'what', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Hard', 'Rock', 'Zombies', 'No', 'need', 'get', 'film', 'best', 'er', 'being', 'worst', 'shown', 'film', 'so', 'really', 'are', 'getting', 'two', 'films', 'one.I', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'fun', 'nostalgic', 'trip', 'got', 'real', 'kick', 'made', 'laugh.Highlights', 'being', 'two', 'elderly', 'ladies', 'one', 'hearing', 'problem', 'think', 'elderly', 'lady', 'Wedding', 'Singer', 'trying', 'make', 'out', 'films', 'plot.The', 'overweight', 'family', 'who', 'use', 'night', 'drive', 'pig', 'out', 'night.The', 'scene', 'where', 'guy', 'swaps', 'sound', 'screen', 'couple', 'making', 'out', 'scene', 'such', 'laugh', 'others', 'what', 'up', 'screen', 'funny', 'too', 'as', 'Hard', 'Rock', 'Zombies', 'made', 'fun', 'here', 'fittingly', 'so.Give', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'it.I', 'love', 'fun']",N/A

The whole film takes place at a drive in, there is a story line, or vignettes rather switching back and forth between cars for reactions, sexual hyjinx, and general mischief, as well as a gang that hangs out at the drive in, looking for and causing trouble, but over all unless you are really into super cheese 80's or really love the movie Hard Rock Zombies this film really wont appeal to most people. I love films in this era and genera but this is really watered down and slapped together.

845808,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0002V7S5C,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 3]","American Drive-In is a really strong contender for worst movie ever made, and no movie I have ever seen tries harder to claim that ignominious crown.  Not content to merely torture us with its own painfully unbearable presentation, the movie injects itself with heavy doses of director Krishna Shah's earlier monstrosity of a movie, Hard Rock Zombies.  I see this in one of two ways.  Either Krishna Shah was the most evil, despicable director to ever live, or else Shah thought that American Drive-In would not seem nearly so bad as it obviously is compared to Hard Rock Zombies.  There really and truly ought to be a law against movies this bad.There's really no story to speak of, but I'll mention some of the things that happen here.  Basically, every disgusting and insane person (not to mention bad actor) in a five hundred mile radius come to the drive-in to watch the dreadful Hard Rock Zombies.  There is a city boy and country girl who seem to think the movie is about them because they alone actually attempt to act at one point (big mistake).  A gang of hoodlums spend the night terrorizing people and attempting to grab and rape the country girl.  A mayoral candidate is trying to catch the local drug dealer in town, but the film his son records of him nabbing the bad guy ends up being a film of him doing something else entirely.  Let's see.  There's also a guy trying to make his girlfriend perform a little service for him, a clueless geek who pontificates on the deep philosophical aspects of Hard Rock Zombies while his hot and randy date fumes.  You have a couple of middle-aged gay men trying to be funny, two old women who have a hard time figuring out modern cinema, some rambunctious kids, an insane projectionist, a dwarf trying to enjoy his own performance in Hard Rock Zombies, and a few other characters I am desperately trying to forget.Other than a scene in which one of the more annoying characters gets the stuffing kicked out of him, there's almost nothing to enjoy here, folks.  When all is said and done, however, one character does deserve special kudos.  A young man takes it upon himself to add some actual comedy to this movie by planting a microphone on a certain van that's a rockin' and somehow rigging it up so that the activities in the van play over the sound system in place of the movie soundtrack.  Thanks heavens for such enterprising youth; without that fine young man, I have to wonder if I could have come out of American Drive-In with my sanity intact.",1,"An excruciatingly horrible, horrible movie",1064793600,"09 29, 2003",2003,2506,"['American', 'Drive-In', 'really', 'strong', 'contender', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'tries', 'harder', 'claim', 'ignominious', 'crown', 'Not', 'content', 'merely', 'torture', 'own', 'painfully', 'unbearable', 'presentation', 'movie', 'heavy', 'doses', 'director', 'Krishna', 'Shah', 'earlier', 'monstrosity', 'movie', 'Hard', 'Rock', 'Zombies', 'see', 'one', 'two', 'ways', 'Krishna', 'Shah', 'was', 'most', 'evil', 'despicable', 'director', 'ever', 'live', 'else', 'Shah', 'thought', 'American', 'Drive-In', 'would', 'not', 'seem', 'nearly', 'so', 'bad', 'obviously', 'compared', 'Hard', 'Rock', 'Zombies', 'really', 'truly', 'ought', 'be', 'law', 'movies', 'bad.There', 'really', 'story', 'speak', ""'ll"", 'mention', 'things', 'happen', 'here', 'Basically', 'disgusting', 'insane', 'person', 'not', 'mention', 'bad', 'actor', 'five', 'hundred', 'mile', 'radius', 'come', 'drive-in', 'watch', 'dreadful', 'Hard', 'Rock', 'Zombies', 'city', 'boy', 'country', 'girl', 'who', 'seem', 'think', 'movie', 'alone', 'actually', 'attempt', 'act', 'one', 'point', 'big', 'mistake', 'gang', 'hoodlums', 'spend', 'night', 'terrorizing', 'people', 'attempting', 'grab', 'rape', 'country', 'girl', 'mayoral', 'candidate', 'trying', 'catch', 'local', 'drug', 'dealer', 'town', 'film', 'son', 'records', 'nabbing', 'bad', 'guy', 'up', 'being', 'film', 'doing', 'something', 'else', 'entirely', 'Let', 'see', 'also', 'guy', 'trying', 'make', 'girlfriend', 'perform', 'little', 'service', 'clueless', 'geek', 'who', 'deep', 'philosophical', 'aspects', 'Hard', 'Rock', 'Zombies', 'hot', 'randy', 'date', 'fumes', 'have', 'couple', 'middle-aged', 'gay', 'men', 'trying', 'be', 'funny', 'two', 'old', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'figuring', 'out', 'modern', 'cinema', 'rambunctious', 'kids', 'insane', 'projectionist', 'dwarf', 'trying', 'enjoy', 'own', 'performance', 'Hard', 'Rock', 'Zombies', 'few', 'other', 'characters', 'am', 'desperately', 'trying', 'forget.Other', 'scene', 'one', 'more', 'annoying', 'characters', 'stuffing', 'kicked', 'almost', 'nothing', 'enjoy', 'here', 'folks', 'When', 'said', 'done', 'however', 'one', 'character', 'deserve', 'special', 'kudos', 'young', 'man', 'add', 'actual', 'comedy', 'movie', 'planting', 'microphone', 'certain', 'van', 'rockin', 'somehow', 'rigging', 'up', 'so', 'activities', 'van', 'play', 'sound', 'system', 'place', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'Thanks', 'heavens', 'such', 'enterprising', 'youth', 'fine', 'young', 'man', 'have', 'wonder', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'American', 'Drive-In', 'sanity', 'intact']",N/A

845810,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,B0002V7S5C,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[4, 4]","Hard Rock Zombies is playing at the local drive-in, and an assorted cast of characters are all there to watch it one evening.  There are too many oddball characters to go through, but some highlights are a film snob who continuously refuses his date's advances to critique the film, a nerd who has seen the film numerous times and shouts out the dialogue, a guy trying to get his girlfriend to go down on him, two little old ladies, a prostitute operating out of her trailer, mischievous children, a drunk projectionist, and a guy trying to make a drug bust to become mayor.  Horror fans will recognize Phil Fondacaro starring as one of the stars of Hard Rock Zombies(which he is) who comes to the drive-in to watch and praise his performance in the film.Most of the film shows these characters engaged in a bunch of pranks and shenanigans, but a plot unfolds as Jack and his girlfriend Bobby Ann are continuously harassed-and later assaulted-by a gang of four thugs.  Numerous attempted rapes and beatings by these thugs kinda offset the comedy aspect.I'm obviously in the minority here, but I really enjoyed this movie.  Even with all it's cliched characters and situations, and it's juvenile attempts at humor, I found myself not so much laughing out loud(which I did do though a time or two), but pleasantly grinning often.Makes me wanna watch Hard Rock Zombies again, and I never thought I'd say that!",4,This Is Why We Need Drive-Ins To Come Back!,1241827200,"05 9, 2009",2009,1406,"['Hard', 'Rock', 'Zombies', 'playing', 'local', 'drive-in', 'assorted', 'cast', 'characters', 'are', 'there', 'watch', 'one', 'evening', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'oddball', 'characters', 'go', 'highlights', 'are', 'film', 'snob', 'who', 'date', 'advances', 'critique', 'film', 'nerd', 'who', 'seen', 'film', 'numerous', 'times', 'out', 'dialogue', 'guy', 'trying', 'get', 'girlfriend', 'go', 'down', 'two', 'little', 'old', 'ladies', 'prostitute', 'operating', 'trailer', 'mischievous', 'children', 'drunk', 'projectionist', 'guy', 'trying', 'make', 'drug', 'bust', 'become', 'mayor', 'Horror', 'fans', 'will', 'recognize', 'Phil', 'Fondacaro', 'starring', 'one', 'stars', 'Hard', 'Rock', 'Zombies', 'who', 'drive-in', 'watch', 'praise', 'performance', 'film.Most', 'film', 'characters', 'engaged', 'bunch', 'pranks', 'shenanigans', 'plot', 'Jack', 'girlfriend', 'Bobby', 'Ann', 'are', 'continuously', 'harassed-and', 'later', 'assaulted-by', 'gang', 'four', 'thugs', 'Numerous', 'attempted', 'rapes', 'beatings', 'thugs', 'kinda', 'comedy', 'aspect.I', ""'m"", 'obviously', 'minority', 'here', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Even', 'cliched', 'characters', 'situations', 'juvenile', 'attempts', 'humor', 'found', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'did', 'do', 'time', 'two', 'pleasantly', 'grinning', 'often.Makes', 'wan', 'na', 'watch', 'Hard', 'Rock', 'Zombies', 'again', 'never', 'thought', ""'d"", 'say']",N/A
