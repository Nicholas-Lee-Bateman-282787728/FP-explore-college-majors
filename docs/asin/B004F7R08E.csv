I thought it would be a religious movie, but there is no religious themes in it but a more common humanitarian theme. The main character of the movie stars as an angel (Molly), who try to get others to see how life is in other people's shoes and how others lives are not as simple as we make it out to be.A great movie for children today.

This movie takes a look into the lives of two different families and reiterates the importance of not judging others, as found in Matthew 7:1.The acting in A Walk in My Shoes was strong and believable and the characters likeable. We also enjoyed the upbeat music throughout. The important lessons learned in this movie gave us good discussion starters. ""Molly"" in the movie was a little bit odd, but still likeable.
