1452877,AAZRWLML88IZK,B005BUA1JY,A kids review,"[2, 3]","Barney Miller is an excellent series.  It is one of the best from the 70's and that's saying something.  Those that missed the show when it originally aired or didn't manage to catch in on reruns on TV will now have the chance to see one of the really good series from TV's past.  Shout! Factory has done an amazing job with this package.  They really went above and beyond the call of duty by including the first season of Fish as a bonus.  It's very reasonably priced too.  At this writing, the collection is less than $100 shipped from Amazon.  For a total of nine seasons of TV?  That's a deal.  Even if you have the earlier Sony releases of seasons 1-3, it's worth the money to get this complete series.

1452880,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B005BUA1JY,Annie Van Auken,"[14, 15]","ABC-TV's BARNEY MILLER aired 170 episodes between 1/23/75 and 5/20/82. For three consecutive seasons ('76, '77, '78) it was in Nielsen's Top 20 and in 1979 it reached #21. Cast changes, especially the departure of Abe Vigoda (Det. Sgt. Philip K. Fish) for his own spinoff series and the death of Jack Soo (Det. Sgt. Nick Yemana) to esophogheal cancer in early 1979, may have caused the show's decline in viewership. CBS's airing ofMAGNUM P.I.opposite Barney probably had an effect as well, or after eight seasons the series may have just run its natural course.The most troubling departure for this Miller fan has always been that of Gregory Sierra, who played Det. Sgt. Chano Amenguale. His character vanished without explanation after Season Two (Sierra went on to his own short-lived series), and when ""Roz"" (Mari Gorman) briefly came aboard over two years later, she was tersely described as Chano's replacement.Two regular cast members in later years, Steve Landesberg and Ron Carey, had their first Miller spots as men in the holding cell. Landesberg played a phony priest and Carey a nabbed cat burglar (Mari Gorman also debuted as an arrestee, a streetwalker). Early on, Linda Lavin (as Det. Janice Wentworth) had a hot and heavy thing with Max Gail (Det. Stan ""Wojo"" Wojciehowicz), but then she left to star in CBS-TV'sALICE. Liz, Barney's wife, was played sporadically by Barbara Barrie in the first two seasons, and then got reduced to someone he occasionally mentioned or spoke to on the phone. (In the Xmas show of Season 3, Barney (Hal Linden) turns down a chance at an affair in favor of his 19 year marriage.)Of the familiar cast, only Hal Linden and Abe Vigoda appeared in BM's half-hour pilot episode, which ABC aired in summer 1974. (Abby Dalton played Liz M.) This script was recycled with a retooled cast for the sitcom's official debut, as a mid-season replacement, the following January.Peripheral and regular characters came and went, but the core of Linden, Gail and Ron Glass (as foppish clotheshorse and would-be author Det. Ron Harris) remained constant. For eight seasons, writing and performances were consistently above average, making BARNEY MILLER arguably the best-ever cop show and one of TV's finest sitcoms..A COMPLETE EPISODE LIST THAT INCLUDES VIEWER RATINGS, ORIGINAL AIRDATESAND GUEST ACTORS IS LOCATED ON COMMENTS #1 and #2, ACCESSIBLE FROM BELOW.",5,Includes a complete and detailed episode list,1317340800,"09 30, 2011",2011,2389,"['ABC-TV', 'BARNEY', 'MILLER', 'aired', '170', 'episodes', '1/23/75', '5/20/82', 'three', 'consecutive', 'seasons', ""'76"", ""'77"", 'was', 'Nielsen', 'Top', '20', '1979', 'reached', '21', 'Cast', 'changes', 'especially', 'departure', 'Abe', 'Vigoda', 'Det', 'Sgt', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Fish', 'own', 'spinoff', 'series', 'death', 'Jack', 'Soo', 'Det', 'Sgt', 'Nick', 'Yemana', 'esophogheal', 'cancer', 'early', '1979', 'may', 'have', 'caused', 'show', 'decline', 'viewership', 'CBS', 'airing', 'ofMAGNUM', 'P.I.opposite', 'Barney', 'probably', 'had', 'effect', 'as', 'well', 'eight', 'seasons', 'series', 'may', 'have', 'just', 'run', 'natural', 'course.The', 'most', 'troubling', 'departure', 'Miller', 'fan', 'always', 'been', 'Gregory', 'Sierra', 'who', 'played', 'Det', 'Sgt', 'Chano', 'Amenguale', 'character', 'vanished', 'explanation', 'Season', 'Two', 'Sierra', 'went', 'own', 'short-lived', 'series', 'when', 'Roz', 'Mari', 'Gorman', 'briefly', 'came', 'aboard', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'tersely', 'described', 'Chano', 'replacement.Two', 'regular', 'cast', 'members', 'later', 'years', 'Steve', 'Landesberg', 'Ron', 'Carey', 'had', 'first', 'Miller', 'spots', 'men', 'holding', 'cell', 'Landesberg', 'played', 'phony', 'priest', 'Carey', 'nabbed', 'cat', 'burglar', 'Mari', 'Gorman', 'also', 'debuted', 'arrestee', 'streetwalker', 'Early', 'Linda', 'Lavin', 'Det', 'Janice', 'Wentworth', 'had', 'hot', 'heavy', 'thing', 'Max', 'Gail', 'Det', 'Stan', 'Wojo', 'Wojciehowicz', 'then', 'left', 'star', ""CBS-TV'sALICE"", 'Liz', 'Barney', 'wife', 'was', 'played', 'sporadically', 'Barbara', 'Barrie', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'then', 'got', 'reduced', 'someone', 'occasionally', 'mentioned', 'spoke', 'phone', 'Xmas', 'show', 'Season', '3', 'Barney', 'Hal', 'Linden', 'down', 'chance', 'affair', 'favor', '19', 'year', 'marriage', 'familiar', 'cast', 'only', 'Hal', 'Linden', 'Abe', 'Vigoda', 'appeared', 'BM', 'half-hour', 'pilot', 'episode', 'ABC', 'aired', 'summer', '1974', 'Abby', 'Dalton', 'played', 'Liz', 'M.', 'script', 'was', 'recycled', 'retooled', 'cast', 'sitcom', 'official', 'debut', 'mid-season', 'replacement', 'following', 'January.Peripheral', 'regular', 'characters', 'came', 'went', 'core', 'Linden', 'Gail', 'Ron', 'Glass', 'foppish', 'clotheshorse', 'would-be', 'author', 'Det', 'Ron', 'Harris', 'remained', 'constant', 'eight', 'seasons', 'writing', 'performances', 'were', 'consistently', 'above', 'average', 'making', 'BARNEY', 'MILLER', 'arguably', 'best-ever', 'cop', 'show', 'one', 'TV', 'finest', 'sitcoms..A', 'COMPLETE', 'EPISODE', 'LIST', 'THAT', 'INCLUDES', 'VIEWER', 'RATINGS', 'ORIGINAL', 'AIRDATESAND', 'GUEST', 'ACTORS', 'IS', 'LOCATED', 'ON', 'COMMENTS', '1', '2', 'ACCESSIBLE', 'FROM', 'BELOW']",Barney Miller: The Complete Series

1452884,AMX6OVOXFDL5Q,B005BUA1JY,Ben Masters,"[0, 0]","This 1975-82 ABC police comedy starring Hal Linden is much funnier than Hogan's Heroes or McHale's Navy. The title track has helped immensely too in my enjoyment.Know what else helps? The way this release is packaged. Many complete releases are packed with each disc in a separate cardboard holder (like M*A*S*H for instance). With M*A*S*H, all 36 discs of that one were in cardboard sleeves that wore deep scratches on the discs (and as such, there have been many justified complaints about how the discs were unwatchable because of the scratches). This Barney release does not do that; the 25 discs (23 for the 8 seasons, and 2 for the first season of Fish) are in 5 slipcases (one with 5 for Nos. 1-2, three more with 6 apiece for Nos. 3-8, and one with 2 for Fish). All 5 cases are in a sturdy gloss box that is meant to represent Barney's office door. There is even a booklet inside labeled ""Squad Room: Detectives"" that has a tribute and episode guide.All in all, through the first season and into #2 (I'm planning on seeing it all over time), I think that I may have found a sitcom that is actually funny and that I am really enjoying.",5,"So far, an excellent comedy (packaging helps too)",1405123200,"07 12, 2014",2014,1142,"['1975-82', 'ABC', 'police', 'comedy', 'starring', 'Hal', 'Linden', 'much', 'funnier', 'Hogan', 'Heroes', 'McHale', 'Navy', 'title', 'track', 'helped', 'immensely', 'too', 'enjoyment.Know', 'what', 'else', 'way', 'release', 'packaged', 'Many', 'complete', 'releases', 'are', 'packed', 'disc', 'separate', 'cardboard', 'holder', 'M*A*S*H', 'instance', 'M*A*S*H', '36', 'discs', 'one', 'were', 'cardboard', 'sleeves', 'wore', 'deep', 'scratches', 'discs', 'such', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'justified', 'complaints', 'how', 'discs', 'were', 'unwatchable', 'scratches', 'Barney', 'release', 'not', 'do', '25', 'discs', '23', '8', 'seasons', '2', 'first', 'season', 'Fish', 'are', '5', 'slipcases', 'one', '5', 'Nos', '1-2', 'three', 'more', '6', 'apiece', 'Nos', '3-8', 'one', '2', 'Fish', '5', 'cases', 'are', 'sturdy', 'gloss', 'box', 'meant', 'represent', 'Barney', 'office', 'door', 'even', 'booklet', 'inside', 'labeled', 'Squad', 'Room', 'Detectives', 'tribute', 'episode', 'guide.All', 'first', 'season', '2', ""'m"", 'planning', 'seeing', 'time', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'found', 'sitcom', 'actually', 'funny', 'am', 'really', 'enjoying']",Barney Miller: The Complete Series

1452888,A2OTT4J4JLCL1G,B005BUA1JY,"C. Gregory ""C. Gregory""","[3, 4]","I have the first season on dvd, I never saw the second on third seasons in the store, but after a bunch of shows that I have already bought started showing up in comlete sets, I assumed this one would too, so I waited. It looks like a good thing that I did. I loved Barney Miller back when I would watch it after school or in reruns. I don't remember much of when I saw it in first run since I was a bit young at the time, but I remember laughing at it. As I got older i started to appreciate the more subtle nuances of the show. You actually care about these characters. Everyone had a life outside of the precinct, and when they'd come together, we'd hear about it, some shows always seem as if the characters have no life unless they are in front of the camera, in this show everyone had their own little backstory and story arch. Harris wanted to be writer, Wojo couldn't pass the exam he needed to be promoted, Barney seemed like he had a lot of pressures both from home and from higher ups, but everyone seemed to genuinley care about each other. It seemed very close to a real job, and how real people acted. Though they had quite a few cast changes, all contributed greatly to the success and humor of the show. Plus, to be able to get Fish in the same collection is a plus, and considering how many seasons this had (plus fish) the price is more than reasonable. Like others have said, I will just give my older copy to someone else who might want it. I don't remember it being very pricy at the time. So no big loss. Besides I am starting to like the idea of how they are boxing seasons now. it takes up less room on the shelf. and I have quite a collection now. So I will definitely be making room for this one...and if anyone is upset about how this show was released, contact the company that put out the original series and ask them what the hell was their problem. but don't just point your animosity at a new company and a newer release, that's just trying to make up for the mistakes of the original company. I think if a company begins to release a series they should release the whole series. But that will never happen cause the studios are all about the money, even when they have a classic quality show, they'd rather release trash if it brings in the dough. So don't blame shout factory or criticise this release. Otherwise companies may decide just not to release certain series at all.update, the packaging is great, a strong sturdy slip cover, booklet and regular sized dvd cases (holding six discs each, except seasons 1 & 2 because of the short first season only has five discs) There are two seasons to a case, and season one is mislabled. they had nine episodes on disc one but only four on disc two, this could be due to the fact that they probably just copied what was out there already, and then continued on where the studio stopped before...I assume they weren't releasing anymore) The booklet is nice and has a small intro with little notes on each episode. the packaging is great, and for the most part it looks great too (probably as good as you can expect a series of it's age to look..if not a bit better). I thoroughly enjoy this show and highly recommend it. One thing I don't understand though, is if they are going to include fish, to give this a more complete feel, then why not release both seasons? There were only two seasons of Fish, so why tease us by giving us season one and not two?

1452897,A1FW37K0DKH5M9,B005BUA1JY,David Seaman,"[3, 3]","""Barney Miller"" (with Hal Linden, Barbara Barrie, Abe Vigoda, Ron Glass, Max Gail and countless others) premiered in January of 1975 and ran for eight seasons. It remains one of the few half hour sit-coms that takes place in a police station. The set is simple- like ""All In The Family""- and the writing is superior. We find ourselves laughing at the continuous parade of criminals who come through the 12th precinct, which is located acorss the street from McDougall Alley in Greenwhich Villlage. The writers make us laugh but also manage to give us much to think about.It's amazing to see the difference in the world in the late 70's to now. To begin with, crime is different. The issues with which they deal are very different than today. The New York they live in is very different from today; New York City was a filthy garbage can in 1976 and we're constanly reminded of this. Now, of course, it is poossible to swim in Long Island Sound. It's been decade4s since raw sewage washed up on the shores and of course, the threat of nuclear war has changed to the threatr of buiological warfare or- God forbid- another tragedy such as Nine- Eleven.The cast is top notch and in some, we have veteran actors (Hal Linden, Abe Vigoda, Barbara Barrie) with a lot of stage experience (Barrie was still riding high from her performance in Sondheim and Furth's world changing musical, ""Company"") while actors such as Linda Lavin, who would go on to win multiple Tony Awards, Emmy Awards and be considered a golden property on the Broadway stage, can be seen in guest roles, young and gifted. Max Gail is a brilliant actor-still working strongly today. Ron Glass has plahyed every part from this one to a space traveling shepard for Joss Weadon. Doris Roberts makes an appearance.Some of the views are archane: homosexuality is seen as a condition, but at least they address it and they do so with respect Women's rights are evident. Mandeatroy retirement looms constantly at only age 62, and there are far too many jokes about Sgt Yamana, the Japanese-American born in Omaha.The bigots are dealt with by making their characters fools. I like it.The 12th precinct is ehtnically blanced, Linden does a wonderful job leading his team while showing compassion and being a good husband and father. (We see his home only during the pilot, which is one of the finest sit-com pilots I've ever seen) and we see this man, accept what he must while loving those around him.The entire series is available for less than ninety bucks and it includes the only season of Fish. I'd say it's well worth it. And iut's something to do while we wait for the contract disputes so the rest of ""Newhart"" can come out. (Is it Duffy or Scolari holding things up?) This make4s the list of top seven best series, in my book: right up there with MASH, MAry Tyler Moore, Cheers, Will & Grace, Frasier and Friends.Great Writing, great acting and beautifully directed and produced.

Pawl ""Dani""","[3, 3]","I wasn't sure if the full series of BARNEY MILLER would ever be released, especially after Sony decided to scrap releasing any more seasons after #3. Gratefully, I learned that SHOUT FACTORY decided it was worth it, and went ahead to release this wonderful (complete) boxed series, in a great container, resembling the door to the precinct. In addition to all episodes in seasons one through eight, there are Bonuses, like interviews with the writers from the show, an excerpt from YOU DON'T KNOW JACK, about the life of Jack Soo, who played Sargent Nick Yemana, the plain clothes officer who made dry wit, bad coffee and racing slips look like an art form, and also, the original, unaired pilot THE LIFE AND TIMES OF BARNEY MILLER. This earlier pilot featured a different cast - that includes another wife for Barney, a character that was a prelude to Wojciehowicz (Max Gail) and a slightly different ""feel."" Gregory Sierra (Chano) and Ron Glass (Harris) were welcome additions, the second go around. What's more, believe it or not, Fish (Abe Vigoda) came off as almost ""perky"" in the first serving of the pilot. All episodes from season one of FISH, the spin off series, are also part of the collection - this was done after Fish (Abe Vigoda) retired from the ""Old 1-2"" and ended up living in a group home with a pack of foster kids and his wife. An interesting concept, but, understandably not the same as his contribution to BARNEY MILLER.The laughs are fast and furious, here. The subject matter intelligently examines a range of topics - prostitution, drug addiction, terrorism, racism, relationships, homophobia, and language barrier (to name a few). I can honestly say that I missed the presence of Chano (Gregory Sierra), the witty, charismatic and hilarious Puerto Rican plain clothes Sargent, who left the series much too quickly after season two. I wish Wentworth (Linda Lavin) would have stuck around longer - but, her role as female plain clothes Sargent, and her romance with Wojo were not to last. Thankfully, a slew of madcap criminals, victims, scenarios and other members of police force came through the doors, to enlighten, entertain and educate.BARNEY MILLER is one of the funniest show I have ever seen, aired on television.

1452911,A3VNNI6PFNK901,B005BUA1JY,J. Gibson,"[1, 1]","I love classic television.  Everything from westerns to the old cop shows and even some cartoons.  Barney Miller was one of those shows that was unique.  It was a half-hour comedy that was also a cop show.  Sure, there have (and still are) a lot of those but this series had something that none of the others did.  This series wasn't afraid to tackle tough subjects along with making you laugh.One of the finest episodes is the first season finale &#34;The Hero&#34;.  In this episode, Sergeant Miguel &#34;Chano&#34; Amangual (Gregory Sierra) kills two bank robbers.  In most cop shows this would be handled one of two ways:  the detective would take the &#34;they were just two criminals&#34; attitude or he wouldn't give it a seconds thought because it was part of his job and move on.  Not Chano.  It was the first time he had ever shot anyone in the line of duty and he felt it.  Despite being applauded for his actions by Inspector Luger (James Gregory), Chano isn't pleased.  Comforting and understanding Captain Miller (Hal Linden) even visits Chano at home to try and make him feel better.  Chano puts on the brave face until Barney leaves then breaks down in tears.  That's an incredibly powerful and moving scene--especially for a show that is a comedy.  Even police dramas of the day didn't focus on the impact of a police shooting to the officer in a realistic way.  Not many modern police dramas have, for that matter.When the brilliant Jack Soo (Sergeant Nick Yemana) passed away on January 11, 1979, Barney Miller did something extraordinary.  Rather than just putting up a dedication message at the end of an episode, the sitcom dedicated an entire episode to Jack Soo.  The actors broke character and were no longer Barney Miller, Ron Harris or Stan Wojciehowicz.  They were Hal Linden, Ron Glass and Max Gail.  They were Jack Soo's friends and co-workers.  They shared their favorite Yemana moments and, when the half hour was finished, raise their coffee cups in a final salute to their beloved friend.  It was an emotionally charged half hour that broke your heart and made you smile as you remembered just how great Jack Soo was at his job.Departures such as this set Barney Miller apart from others shows of its day and shows since.  You saw the human side of the detectives working the run-down, and often crazy, 12th Precinct.  You saw them for all their strengths, weaknesses and many flaws.  You were introduced to their families and even got to say a heartfelt goodbye to them.  You are introduced to some of the extremely colorful characters the 12th Precinct Detectives come in contact with every day and, some of them, you get to see more than once.  You loved the characters for how human they were.  Sometimes they made you laugh, sometimes they made you cry but they always entertained you.In this set you have all eight seasons of this amazing and ground-breaking show.  There are four cases each containing two seasons.  The first season of the 1977 spin-off &#34;Fish&#34; is also included as a two disc set bringing the final DVD total of this set to 25.  There is a wonderful 39-page booklet included with the set that not only gives you a complete episode guide but has a wonderful 5-page &#34;Salute to Barney Miller&#34; essay by Howard Rosenberg with a comment by award-winning author and former LAPD Detective Sergeant Joseph Wambaugh.This set is very well worth the price and is something that should be part of any television enthusiasts collection.  The packaging is sturdy and the cases make accessing the DVD's easy and protects them from potential damage.  If you enjoy great comedy that is sometimes off-the-wall but always funny, you shouldn't pass this complete series package up.  Buy it, pop the corn, chill the soda, order or bake a pizza and kick back, relax and let the personalities of the 12th Precinct take you away from whatever might be getting you down.

No matter what the video and audio quality grades are that one may assign this item, it doesn't change the fact that it is very unlikely that another `digitally enhanced' or `high definition' version of this series will ever be released.  Most distributors and studios are decreasing the amount of physical videos made each year as they turn their attention to streaming internet content.  The bottom line is this is a solid DVD collection and should satisfy fans of this outstanding comedy series.  [ Note the special features include a couple of good retrospective documentaries and season 1 of the spin-off `Fish' (which is below average, but will appeal to viewers seeking family-friendly entertainment). ]TECHNICAL GRADES:Season 1:  This season needs substantial remastering as the video goes back and forth between levels of clarity.[ Video:  D+;  Audio:  C ]Seasons 2-3:  These two seasons surprisingly have the best video quality in this set.  Clarity does vary episode to episode, however.  [ Video:  B;  Audio:  B ]Season 4:  Uneven clarity all season long.  [ Video: C-;  Audio:  C ]Seasons 5-6, 8:  These seasons have consistent video quality, except for occasional tint issues.[ Video:  B-;  Audio:  B- ]Season 7:  While it has decent video quality, the audio experiences some inconsistencies on a few episodes.[ Video:  B-;  Audio:  C+ ]SERIES REVIEW:Season 1-3:  The first three seasons are really the glory period for this show.  Sgt. Chano's energy was an underrated component and it is a shame the producers were not able to keep actor Gregory Sierra on the show.  It is no accident that the best episode of `Barney Miller' called ""The Hero"" features Chano.  The original cast chemistry was wonderful and sadly never equaled in the latter seasons.Season 4:  The show is clearly in transition as the same running gags are found on episode after episode.  Also, the departures of actors Abe Vigoda and Gregory Sierra are painfully noticeable as Steve Landesberg and Ron Carey's characters are not able to hold their own this season.  It wasn't a good idea to have three droll and dry witted characters on at the same time (namely Yemana, Dietrich & Levitt).  One of the lesser seasons to be sure.Season 5:  The series returns to top form as social issues are tackled in frank yet humorous manner.  Actor Ron Glass is given more to do and he rises to the task.  Sgt. Dietrich loses his stoic posture and reveals that he is quite the passionate progressive.  After seasons 3 & 4, one is happy to see actor Steve Landesberg passionate about anything!  The last great season of this show.Season 6:  Another solid season that is memorable for giving Officer Levitt finally something more to do than suck up to everyone.  Unfortunately, the worst `Barney Miller' episode (""Uniform Days"") appears this season.  Sgt. Harris crosses the line with Barney in a manner that is neither humorous nor realistic.  However that episode, for better or worse, begins a two season long story arch that takes Harris to some dark places.  Actor Hal Linden is terrific in the season finale, ""Fog.""Season 7:  A mean spirited tone permeates throughout the worst season of `Barney Miller.'  This declaration doesn't change the fact that it is still good overall - just simply the least of the eight seasons.  A real surprise that two of the best episodes this season feature Officer Levitt (namely ""Field Associate"" & ""Stormy Weather"").  Oddly, actors Max Gail and Steve Landesberg have diminished roles as Ron Glass and Ron Carey are frequently center stage this season.  This is probably due to the writers' challenge of creating stories in what is essentially a two-set sitcom.  Wojo was featured often in seasons 1 through 5, while Dietrich was featured often in seasons 4 through 6.  So, in the writers' minds, Harris and Levitt were obviously viewed as characters ripe for exploration.Season 8:  This season is a fitting close to a great show that was able to mix satire, farce and social commentary into an endearing dish of comedy.  While Hal Linden playing the straight man to his wacky associates goes unnoticed at times throughout eight seasons, it must be said that this show wouldn't have worked without him.  From seasons 5 to 8, it is incredible the number of the same supporting actors that appear in multiple episodes.  The producers apparently used the same veteran actors they could rely on that didn't mind the long shooting schedules.  Season 8 does try to return the show to its roots by focusing more on adventures at the precinct and less on the detectives' personal lives.  (See ""Examination Day"" & ""The Clown"" for episodes reminiscent of the early seasons.)  This back-to-basics approach is a welcome change after the much darker season 7.TOP 10 EPISODES:1)  ""The Hero""  [Season 1, episode 13]2)  ""The Architect""  [Season 6, episode 124]3)  ""The Harris

1452923,A2XRZV63X79YSJ,B005BUA1JY,"Movie Mania ""DVD Collector""","[9, 26]","Barney Miller was a great series.  Well the first three seasons were fantastic.  The next two were great and the last three were just okay.Now that said.  I have to agree that it is terrible that Shout is only releasing the entire set and not the remaining seasons individually.  Many people had the same feelings about Mary Tyler Moore (the first 4 seasons were released by 20th and then Sony was to release the complete series.) but there was an uproar and the remaining sets were released over a year.  So for those who do not want repay for sets they already have, then don't and wait it out.On the good side, is that Shout has priced this reasonably this set at about $20 a season MSRP.  Less than that if you include the season of Fish.  And if you are willing to wait a little, someone (probably Amazon) will have it on sale over the holidays for at least 50% off.Lastly, don't trust Shout to provide complete episodes.  About half the episodes in the first season of Rhoda were the edited syndicated episodes.  I am not blaming them because they can only release what they are given.

1452925,AI0PV0FQLGEAY,B005BUA1JY,Natalie Dressed,"[5, 5]","I've read that Barney Miller's appeal was limited to a select audience -- mostly guys in police, fire and military work -- but this female viewer loved it too and did so from the start. So what if it had predominately male characters, very few (and mostly unattractive) women, and almost never left its dingy squad room set? This award-winning TV series also had terrific writing; a pitch-perfect cast playing ""real"" detectives who guzzled bad coffee and did a lot more paperwork than stakeouts; a slew of old-pro character actors who played the quirky victims and perps they processed; and cool-jazz title and credit tracks I never got tired of listening to. It was street-smart and funny as hell -- and (surprise!) it never got cancelled. The series ended on its own, before any shark-jumping ruined it.Barney Miller still holds up well. Having just watched all eight seasons, I see how prescient the series was in addressing issues like the environment, city politics and budget cuts, hiring women for the job and getting promotions. It was also unusually daring in featuring stories about race, gender and religious discrimination; the homeless and street people; cops' relationships with prostitutes; sexual orientation (BM writers consulted with a gay support group to create its recurring gay characters; and people with disabilities. It was comedy with a conscience.I'm glad I got this handsome box set edition. It includes all eight seasons; the first and only season of Fish (the spin-off series for Abe Vigoda's character); a descriptive booklet about the series and title listings; and a bonus DVD featuring the main writers and most of the cast in recent interviews, and the original pilot. The writers also narrate commentary tracks for the last three episodes of the show. The video images and audio are in decent shape. The DVDs are packaged in plastic jewel box cases (unlike M*A*S*H with those awful disc-damaging cardboard slots). IMO the extras alone are worth the price, which isn't outrageous.So if like me, you've missed the ole one-two for decades, put your peg back in the roster board with this box set.

1452934,A413ABZIU3RBS,B005BUA1JY,Robert J. Keil,"[74, 77]","Looks like I am the first reviewer here on Amazon to have actually viewed these discs, so hopefully people will find my initial reactions useful.So much has been said about the series itself I won't repeat any of it here. Just be assured that Barney Miller is one of the best written, best acted sitcoms (or any TV series for that matter) ever. I've seen every episode multiple times and have been collecting recordings of this show on commercially available VHS tapes, broadcast sources, and DVDs for many years. So I was very glad to see Shout Factory pick up the baton where Sony left off and release the show as it should have been from the beginning, as a complete series set.I have not seen all the episodes in this set yet, but the ones I have seen run about 25 minutes instead of the 22-minute syndicated versions most often seen on TV since the show's original run. The picture quality is great for a TV series shot on video in the 1970s. About as good as it possibly can look, I'm sure. Sound quality is excellent. The packaging is very well done, tasteful, and discs are NOT stacked on top of each other on a single spindle as many of these mega-sets have been packaged recently. The 40-page book has a nice few pages of intro but the rest is essentially an episode guide for each season and disc.The extras and supplements are great. There are about an hour and a half worth of shorts featuring Hal Linden, Max Gail, Abe Vigoda, and two of the writers. These are well worth watching. For me the real treat in the extras was the unaired pilot episode of ""The Life and Times of Barney Miller"" which is quite different from the show we know as Barney Miller. The pilot was shot on film, first of all, and looks very different from the ""real"" show for that one reason alone. The sets are almost exactly the same, but Linden and Vigoda are the only cops who play the same roles in the actual series. The show focused much more on Barney's home life and was split about 50/50 between the 2 sets.There are several very insightful commentaries by the writers on some of the episodes. I learned a lot about the series that I did not know. Particularly fascinating were the ""rules"" of scriptwriting for Barney Miller, the unique way of shooting that was employed, and the unusual relationship (or lack of it) that Danny Arnold and the writing staff had with ABC. Really worthwhile and interesting stuff. The first season of Fish is a nice bonus but I have not gotten into viewing those discs.If I have one complaint about this set it is that the first three seasons are absolutely identical to the previous Sony releases. Basically the Sony discs have been re-labeled with new artwork but the entire content of those discs (including the menus) are Sony's previous releases, manufactured again for this set. Ideally, Shout would have made new menus that matched their treatment of seasons 4-8, which in my opinion is better than what Sony did. This one gripe makes me wish Shout would have not just ""ported over"" the old discs into their set. But when you look at the massive amount of great stuff you get in this set, that is an imperfection well worth putting up with.If you like Barney Miller, do not hesitate to buy this set. I sold my old single-season sets of the first 3 seasons on ebay to subsidize this purchase and when you look at Amazon's price which is currently in the $100 range you are talking about less than a dollar an episode for an absolutely top-notch show. This set was a tremendous undertaking by Shout Factory to produce and I must give kudos to them for all their work in preserving this deserving series for the digital age. You will not be disappointed by the results of that effort.",5,"One of the Best Sitcoms Ever, Great DVD set",1319587200,"10 26, 2011",2011,3713,"['Looks', 'am', 'first', 'reviewer', 'here', 'Amazon', 'have', 'actually', 'viewed', 'discs', 'so', 'hopefully', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'initial', 'reactions', 'useful.So', 'much', 'been', 'said', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'here', 'Just', 'be', 'assured', 'Barney', 'Miller', 'one', 'best', 'written', 'best', 'acted', 'sitcoms', 'TV', 'series', 'matter', 'ever', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'episode', 'multiple', 'times', 'have', 'been', 'collecting', 'recordings', 'show', 'commercially', 'available', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'broadcast', 'sources', 'DVDs', 'many', 'years', 'So', 'was', 'very', 'glad', 'see', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'pick', 'up', 'baton', 'where', 'Sony', 'left', 'off', 'release', 'show', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'beginning', 'complete', 'series', 'set.I', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'episodes', 'set', 'yet', 'ones', 'have', 'seen', 'run', '25', 'minutes', 'instead', '22-minute', 'syndicated', 'versions', 'most', 'often', 'seen', 'TV', 'show', 'original', 'run', 'picture', 'quality', 'great', 'TV', 'series', 'shot', 'video', '1970s', 'as', 'good', 'possibly', 'can', 'look', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Sound', 'quality', 'excellent', 'packaging', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'tasteful', 'discs', 'are', 'NOT', 'stacked', 'top', 'other', 'single', 'spindle', 'many', 'mega-sets', 'have', 'been', 'packaged', 'recently', '40-page', 'book', 'nice', 'few', 'pages', 'intro', 'rest', 'essentially', 'episode', 'guide', 'season', 'disc.The', 'extras', 'supplements', 'are', 'great', 'are', 'hour', 'half', 'worth', 'shorts', 'featuring', 'Hal', 'Linden', 'Max', 'Gail', 'Abe', 'Vigoda', 'two', 'writers', 'are', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'real', 'treat', 'extras', 'was', 'unaired', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Life', 'Times', 'Barney', 'Miller', 'quite', 'different', 'show', 'know', 'Barney', 'Miller', 'pilot', 'was', 'shot', 'film', 'first', 'very', 'different', 'real', 'show', 'one', 'reason', 'alone', 'sets', 'are', 'almost', 'exactly', 'same', 'Linden', 'Vigoda', 'are', 'only', 'cops', 'who', 'play', 'same', 'roles', 'actual', 'series', 'show', 'focused', 'much', 'more', 'Barney', 'home', 'life', 'was', 'split', 'about', '50/50', '2', 'sets.There', 'are', 'several', 'very', 'insightful', 'commentaries', 'writers', 'episodes', 'learned', 'lot', 'series', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'Particularly', 'fascinating', 'were', 'rules', 'scriptwriting', 'Barney', 'Miller', 'unique', 'way', 'shooting', 'was', 'employed', 'unusual', 'relationship', 'lack', 'Danny', 'Arnold', 'writing', 'staff', 'had', 'ABC', 'Really', 'worthwhile', 'interesting', 'stuff', 'first', 'season', 'Fish', 'nice', 'bonus', 'have', 'not', 'gotten', 'viewing', 'discs.If', 'have', 'one', 'complaint', 'set', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'are', 'absolutely', 'identical', 'previous', 'Sony', 'releases', 'Basically', 'Sony', 'discs', 'have', 'been', 're-labeled', 'new', 'artwork', 'entire', 'content', 'discs', 'including', 'menus', 'are', 'Sony', 'previous', 'releases', 'manufactured', 'again', 'set', 'Ideally', 'Shout', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'new', 'menus', 'matched', 'treatment', 'seasons', '4-8', 'opinion', 'better', 'what', 'Sony', 'did', 'one', 'gripe', 'wish', 'Shout', 'would', 'have', 'not', 'just', 'ported', 'old', 'discs', 'set', 'when', 'look', 'massive', 'amount', 'great', 'stuff', 'get', 'set', 'imperfection', 'well', 'putting', 'up', 'with.If', 'Barney', 'Miller', 'do', 'not', 'hesitate', 'buy', 'set', 'sold', 'old', 'single-season', 'sets', 'first', '3', 'seasons', 'ebay', 'subsidize', 'purchase', 'when', 'look', 'Amazon', 'price', 'currently', '100', 'range', 'are', 'talking', 'less', 'dollar', 'episode', 'absolutely', 'top-notch', 'show', 'set', 'was', 'tremendous', 'undertaking', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'produce', 'must', 'give', 'kudos', 'work', 'preserving', 'deserving', 'series', 'digital', 'age', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'results', 'effort']",Barney Miller: The Complete Series

What made these shows great was the writing and character development. Barney Miller is arguably one of the best (and possibly under-rated) sitcoms ever produced for television. What made it different from other cop shows was that it depicted more of the every day reality of police work rather than the usual, shoot-'em up, and ""glamorous"" portrayal of police officers/detectives that you see on the majority of cop shows. So far, I have watched about a half a dozen episodes. As another reviewer wrote, the picture quality (and sound) is pretty decent for a tv show from the 1970's considering that it was videotaped.

1452948,A1SDPA1J98UP4L,B005BUA1JY,"THE AUTISTIC WEREWOLF ""Wolf""","[2, 2]","Ok so many people have already told you how great the BARNEY MILLER series was and they are ALL ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!  Barney Miller just had a sense of realism to it because; none of the cops were anything other than good men and occasional ladies trying to protect and serve all of New York City's odd ball citizens.  I see reading some reviews that a few people are upset or feel ill used because; the boxed set includes the first three seasons that schlub's like me brought.  Yeah I brought the first three seasons soon as they were available so I paid dearly for each one. If I had it to do again I'd buy each of the first three seasons again!!!!  I truly loved Barney Miller especially the gentleman who felt he was a werewolf.  The sporadically recurring two gay effeminate felons was also a hoot as well!  My favorite quote was when one of the two gay gent's told a hardened felon type locked in the cell with them, ""I have candy up at my place!""However lets get back to the people who feel bad for buying the first three individual series box sets.  Why don't I feel ill used you might ask.  I brought the first three seasons and I had them years earlier to enjoy before this complete series set was released.  I figure that the sales of the first three seasons did not gross the kind of money needed to make it profitable for a main line media company to release.  So the release was farmed out to a small quality outfit that had smaller overhead.  A smaller overhead means that smaller sales numbers brings a profit faster when your production costs are much less.  The price for the overall Barney Miller Set is not unrealistic when you compare it to the truly outrageous prices sought by Paramount Studios for almost anything it sells. All eight seasons for Barney Miller while not a steal is a value especially if you truly love the unique Barney Miller Comedy team.  As an black autistic man I was never a big fan of police officers growing up.  Watching Barney Miller taught me a grudging respect for the finer true officers of the law who try to treat citizens with respect.Also the opening or intro music on some of the DVD's has been jazzed up a bit.  The original Barney Miller theme had a more laid back blues feeling to it that is gone in the new openings.  Again some Barney Miller purists might be miffed.  Some may say the repackaging went too far.  Unfortunately many times the original music is owned or co-owned by others who might want wild amounts of money to use ""their original version of the Barney Miller Theme Music!""  Paying super inflated prices for original music would add cost to the final price of the DVD's so rightly to contain costs new music is used.  Yeah it might make some Barney Miller purist's mad because; the original music is gone BUT, you get to enjoy all the Barney Miller episodes in their original glory.  As Lt Detrick would say or maybe not.  Anyway you slice it, I'm just glad to have the entire Barney Miller Series on DVD uncut and of good basic video quality.  Life is about compromises you can live with.  This Barney Miller Complete series is a compromise I'll gladly live with and LOVE IT!Best of all Barney Miller taught me with laughter.  Barney Miller was one of the true joys of my childhood years and having all 8 seasons to watch will make me feel like an old dear friend has come home to visit me, I can't remember a time when $99.00 brought me so much joy!

Notice, I did not say sit-com because that, more often than not, denotes an insipid, full of laughter and little else, program.  Barney Miller managed to put together shows which had laughter, tears, social relevance, traumatic events and camraderie which left you with ideas to think about...not just laugh and then forget.  It was about the building of a team through friendships and hardships; good times and bad times; people you'd live with and people you'd die for.  Television comedies have nothing like this today...nothing like this or Maude or All in the Family which were able to tackle pertinent social issues with both laughter and tears.

(""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" is brilliant, but not excruciatingly funny.) Among these, ""Barney Miller"" is primum inter pares.Not only is ""Barney Miller""'s wit dry -- dry enough to mop up the Johnstown flood -- but largely based on ordinary conversation, rather than a setup/punchline format. The ensemble cast -- an odd mixture of actors and stand-up comics -- is one of the best ever assembled for a TV series. Though the characters are stereotypes, they're sufficiently fleshed-out that we can find a plausible humanity in them.Surprisingly, ""Barney Miller"" remains strikingly un-dated. Crime, criminals, and people's reaction to crime have changed very little.There are at least two classic episodes -- an early one in which Chano is forced to kill a bank thief, and the (in)famous one in which the squad consumes hash-laced brownies.This set is an absolute must for any classic-TV collector. Or anyone who appreciates great comic writing and acting.TECHNICAL STUFFShout! Factory promised to fix all the technical problems that have existed from the beginning. They did not, as it would have taken too long and cost too much money.These problems include color fringing and blooming (which persisted throughout the series), and variations in brightness, color, and saturation among the cameras. * ""Landmark I"" and ""Landmark II"" are particularly bad, (invalid) examples of why NTSC was said to stand for ""never twice the same color"". One of the 7th season's episodes has muffled, slightly ""phasey"" sound.* This is not only incomprehensible, but inexcusable, showing either extreme incompetence or an utter lack of concern on the part of ABC's technicians.",5,Best...

I hope younger viewers won't get lost, but I think they'll manage and for some it may be a motivator in studying history as my Dad's stack of 1950s MAD MAGAZINEs were for me.And I promise you, there is not one bad episode in the bunch - not even a weak plot, nor are the principals ever written ""out-of-character"" (think Kirk berating Spock every other episode third season 'Star Trek:TOS').In fact, they actually grow as the series progresses through it's eight season run, something even M*A*S*H* characters barely did, if believably.""Barney Miller""?Best TV series, ever.",5,Best TV Comedy Ever!,1317513600,"10 2, 2011",2011,2321,"['Just', 'brief', 'word', 'who', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'been', 'tricked', 'paying', 'twice', 'Normally', 'too', 'am', 'furious', 'kind', 'deception', 'case', 'are', 'receiving', 'individual', 'seasons', 'less', '14.00', 'MUCH', 'less', 'could', 'ever', 'hope', 'pay', 'were', 'released', 'individually', 'likely', '24.99', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'single', 'seasons.So', 'do', ""n't"", 'hem', 'haw', 'long', 'grab', 'Amazon', 'discounted', 'price', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'recall', 'what', 'problem', 'was', 'SHOUT', 'Factory', 'have', 'treated', 'BM', 'fans', 'well', 'more', 'fairly', 'are', 'be', 'commended', '**************************************************************************BM', 'time', 'favorite', 'TV', 'show', 'Hoorah', 'last', 'complete', 'set', 'not', 'just', 'actors', 'are', 'great', ""'m"", 'love', 'dirty', 'New', 'York', 'youth', 'not', 'over-priced', 'Disney', 'Theme', 'Park', 'become', 'BM', 'taste', 'mood', 'feel', 'mid-Seventies', 'more', 'expressive', 'ethnicities', 'persuasions', 'once', 'dominated', 'city', 'daily', 'life.BM', 'also', 'most', 'honestly', 'human', 'humane', 'humor', 'ever', 'comitted', 'videotape', 'film', 'amusingly', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'sometimes', 'outrageous', 'racy', 'tone', 'never', 'becoming', 'actually', 'offensive.The', 'plot', 'episode', 'up', 'truth', 'most', 'dwellers', 'Greater', 'Metropolitan', 'Area', 'know', 'few', 'others', 'even', 'suspected', '9/11', 'gruff', 'rude', 'occasionally', 'criminal', 'exterior', 'average', 'New', 'Yorker', 'when', 'chips', 'are', 'down', 'spirits', 'are', 'up', 'kindness', 'humanity', 'are', 'found', 'even', 'hardest', 'hearts.On', 'dry', 'side', 'BM', 'also', 'documents', 'emotions', 'attitudes', 'era', 'NYC', 'history', 'topical', 'Daily', 'News', 'Page', 'One', 'plots', 'hope', 'younger', 'viewers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'lost', 'think', ""'ll"", 'manage', 'may', 'be', 'motivator', 'studying', 'history', 'Dad', 'stack', '1950s', 'MAD', 'MAGAZINEs', 'were', 'me.And', 'promise', 'not', 'one', 'bad', 'episode', 'bunch', 'not', 'even', 'weak', 'plot', 'are', 'principals', 'ever', 'written', 'out-of-character', 'think', 'Kirk', 'berating', 'Spock', 'other', 'episode', 'third', 'season', 'Trek', 'TOS', '.In', 'fact', 'actually', 'grow', 'series', 'eight', 'season', 'run', 'something', 'even', 'M*A*S*H*', 'characters', 'barely', 'did', 'believably', 'Barney', 'Miller', 'Best', 'TV', 'series', 'ever']",Barney Miller: The Complete Series
