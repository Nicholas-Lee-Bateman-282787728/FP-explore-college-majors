She plays the defiantly lesbian Allegra who can't seem to commit. When her girlfriend Samantha walks out, Allegra quickly meets two attractive strangers -- philosophy prof. Phillip and glass blowing banker Grace. What she doesn't know is that Phillip and Grace are a long-standing and unhappy couple.Before long, Allegra is cavorting with both (separately), surprised to be enjoying a physical relationship with a man, still trying to work out her commitment issues. Of course, it's only a matter of time until the distraught couple realize they are both sleeping with Allegra. (I'm not giving anything away here -- it's all laid out in the opening scene of the movie.)There's nothing very profound about this film but the acting is good and there are some witty moments, all of which makes it  pleasant entertainment.",3,Amusing comedy of manners,1282348800,"08 21, 2010",2010,902,"['Elizabeth', 'Reaser', 'attractive', 'star', 'amusing', 'New', 'York', 'comedy', 'manners', 'defiantly', 'lesbian', 'Allegra', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'commit', 'When', 'girlfriend', 'Samantha', 'out', 'Allegra', 'quickly', 'two', 'attractive', 'strangers', 'philosophy', 'prof.', 'Phillip', 'glass', 'blowing', 'banker', 'Grace', 'What', ""n't"", 'know', 'Phillip', 'Grace', 'are', 'long-standing', 'unhappy', 'couple.Before', 'long', 'Allegra', 'cavorting', 'separately', 'surprised', 'be', 'enjoying', 'physical', 'relationship', 'man', 'still', 'trying', 'work', 'out', 'commitment', 'issues', 'course', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'distraught', 'couple', 'realize', 'are', 'sleeping', 'Allegra', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'here', 'laid', 'out', 'opening', 'scene', 'movie', 'nothing', 'very', 'profound', 'film', 'acting', 'good', 'are', 'witty', 'moments', 'pleasant', 'entertainment']",N/A

The story revolves around an undecided young woman who can't decide whether she is really a lesbian, whether she loved the last girlfriend who dumped her for her inability to commit, whether she is now in love with a man or maybe with his... ex-girlfriend. As you can imagine, the situation will get complicated very quickly, giving rise to fairly trite situations.Acting is mostly mediocre, and would be just fine for a TV sitcom. Tina Benko and Justin Kirk save the day a bit, but the main character, played by Elizabeth Reaser, is very forgettable, rather silly, and not even very attractive.

1052173,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B000N2H8XC,barry,"[2, 2]","This movie is a very enjoyable, thought provoking romantic comedy.  It comes across as lighter than it actually is.  But its lightness makes it a joy to watch and it will linger in your thoughts after with the messages it puts across.PUCCINI FOR BEGINNERS tells the story of a lesbian who keeps having short lived romantic relationships due to her fear of commitment.  The film begins with yet another girlfriend breaking up with her and then our main character settles for living life alone.  Of course at that point she meets two people with whom she becomes involved - a man and a woman.  And the added twist is they are a couple themselves.The film is not a statement movie about homosexuality but rather a film where all the characters accept each other for who they are.  Allegra, our main character is indeed a lesbian, but she does not hate men.  She develops feelings for the man with whom she gets involved but she knows it is a rarity.  She is most comfortable with women.  He also accepts her and does not question why a lesbian is being with a man.  As he says TO ME YOU ARE JUST ALLEGRA.The story unfolds with solid acting and comic situations mixed in as Allegra goes on a deep journey of self discovery.  Believe it or not, I must disagree with some other reviewers.  I do believe some peoples lives are as straightforward and carefree as our characters here.  For this movie requires a deeper examination.  Their outer lives seem satisfying yet all of them are going through inner emotional struggles.  They are all good people who are learning about themselves and sometimes good is rewarded.it is a joy to see a gay film that is not an issue film but merely a film about believable, very real characters on realistic journeys.  I highly recommend you travel with them.  You will laugh, may have a tear or two and it will linger with you after.  You will certainly be inspecting the way you yourself feel about true commitment and acceptance.Very enjoyable.

1052176,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000N2H8XC,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 3]","Directed and written by Maria Maggenti (The Incredibly True Adventures of Two Girls in Love), this disheveled 2007 romantic triangle comedy has several likable elements, but it never seems to coalesce into something more resonant. The chief problem is that the protagonist, a neurotic, opera-loving lesbian writer appropriately named Allegra, is so perpetually self-absorbed that her dilemma never elicits much sympathy. Elizabeth Reaser (superb inSweet Land - A Love Story) is an appealing character actress but frankly not charismatic enough to get away with the commitment-phobic shenanigans that Maggenti throws her way in the acerbic script. The gap causes an odd imbalance with her more intriguing co-stars Justin Kirk and Gretchen Mol. Kirk, who soared as Prior Walter in Mike Nichols' epic 2003 adaptation of Tony Kushner'sAngels in America, harnesses his quirky persona effectively to play Philip, a bored philosophy professor who becomes attracted to Allegra.In turn, Allegra finds herself drawn to Philip but is still reeling from a break-up with her conflicted girlfriend of nine months. Meanwhile, Mol (refreshingly frank asThe Notorious Bettie Page) seems to be channeling a bit of Meg Ryan's flaky self-righteousness in playing Grace, a pert glass-blower who just broke up with Philip. Grace meets Allegra, and the standard complications ensue. Even with the lesbian angle, which Maggenti handles with aplomb, the indie movie feels more like a throwback to a 1930's screwball farce, especially seen in a hectic party scene where all three principals converge in a most haphazard way. Emotional isolation is a worthy theme to explore, but Maggenti can't make the film snap with the strength of her witty observations. One would have also expected a reference to Puccini, in particular, his tragic operaTurandot, to be reflected more fully than it does here through the plodding plot structure. The 2007 DVD has an insightful commentary track from Maggenti and editor Susan Graef, as well as a couple of deleted scenes.",3,Likable Romantic Triangle Comedy Hamstrung by a Lackluster Lead and Plodding Pacing,1184630400,"07 17, 2007",2007,2032,"['Directed', 'written', 'Maria', 'Maggenti', 'Incredibly', 'True', 'Adventures', 'Two', 'Girls', 'Love', 'disheveled', '2007', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'comedy', 'several', 'likable', 'elements', 'never', 'coalesce', 'something', 'more', 'resonant', 'chief', 'problem', 'protagonist', 'neurotic', 'opera-loving', 'lesbian', 'writer', 'appropriately', 'named', 'Allegra', 'so', 'perpetually', 'self-absorbed', 'dilemma', 'never', 'much', 'sympathy', 'Elizabeth', 'Reaser', 'superb', 'inSweet', 'Land', 'Love', 'Story', 'appealing', 'character', 'actress', 'frankly', 'not', 'charismatic', 'enough', 'get', 'away', 'commitment-phobic', 'shenanigans', 'Maggenti', 'way', 'acerbic', 'script', 'gap', 'odd', 'imbalance', 'more', 'intriguing', 'co-stars', 'Justin', 'Kirk', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', 'Kirk', 'who', 'soared', 'Prior', 'Walter', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'epic', '2003', 'adaptation', 'Tony', ""Kushner'sAngels"", 'America', 'quirky', 'persona', 'effectively', 'play', 'Philip', 'bored', 'philosophy', 'professor', 'who', 'attracted', 'Allegra.In', 'turn', 'Allegra', 'drawn', 'Philip', 'still', 'reeling', 'break-up', 'conflicted', 'girlfriend', 'nine', 'months', 'Meanwhile', 'Mol', 'refreshingly', 'asThe', 'Notorious', 'Bettie', 'Page', 'be', 'channeling', 'bit', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'flaky', 'self-righteousness', 'playing', 'Grace', 'pert', 'glass-blower', 'who', 'just', 'broke', 'up', 'Philip', 'Grace', 'Allegra', 'standard', 'complications', 'ensue', 'Even', 'lesbian', 'angle', 'Maggenti', 'aplomb', 'indie', 'movie', 'feels', 'more', 'throwback', '1930', 'screwball', 'farce', 'especially', 'seen', 'hectic', 'party', 'scene', 'where', 'three', 'principals', 'converge', 'most', 'haphazard', 'way', 'Emotional', 'isolation', 'worthy', 'theme', 'explore', 'Maggenti', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'snap', 'strength', 'witty', 'observations', 'One', 'would', 'have', 'also', 'expected', 'reference', 'Puccini', 'particular', 'tragic', 'operaTurandot', 'be', 'reflected', 'more', 'fully', 'here', 'plodding', 'plot', 'structure', '2007', 'DVD', 'insightful', 'commentary', 'track', 'Maggenti', 'editor', 'Susan', 'Graef', 'as', 'well', 'couple', 'deleted', 'scenes']",N/A
1052177,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,B000N2H8XC,Hikari,"[1, 4]","This movie is about as subtle as a meat-tenderizing hammer as it's beating us around the head with its pro-gay agenda.  But appealing performances keep it from being just a self-conscious film school project.  The luminous Elisabeth Reaser stars as Allegra, our prickly, sexually-confused heroine.  After a breakup with her longtime girlfriend (Julienne Nicholson), Allegra finds herself carrying on a flirtation (and soon much more) with a man (Justin Kirk) who happens to be quite nearly engaged to someone else (Gretchen Mol).  In a turn of events that could only happen in a Manhattan-based sex comedy, Allegra is soon introducing her male lover's clueless girlfriend to the joys of Sapphic love as well.  Juggling booty calls from two lovers, one of each gender, proves exhausting, not to mention morally ambiguous (!).  So when Allegra's lovers find that they have two-timing each other with Allegra, both Allegra and the audience are quite relieved. In another twist that could only happen in a Manhattan-based sex comedy, this disclosure happens at a swank catered party, with Allegra wearing catering duds.  I'm not sure, but I'd wager that Woody Allen's been there done that already.  Reaser is a quirky rising talent who we should be seeing a lot more from.  She played Diane Keaton's eldest daughter in ""The Family Stone"" and with good reason--she strikingly resembles the young Keaton.  She has a wry way of delivering her lines through her teeth, almost as if she's delivering them as asides.  ""Can you believe this dreck?"" she seems to say as she grits out lines like ""Marriage is slavery.""  Kirk (recently of ""Angels in America"") seems to be an odd vehicle for helping Allegra to discover her latent heterosexuality; he is not nearly as appealing as the women in this film, which is probably the whole point.  Gretchen Mol is charming and I'd chose her over Justin Kirk, too, and I'm straight.  This is a highly stylized, picture-postcard Manhattan, where it never rains, the streets aren't crowded and nobody ever works or has to wait for a table . . .they just have a lot of sex in their fabulous apartments, have arguments in fab restaurants and attend glossy parties, at which they fight some more.

This is a very deep philosophical question. Even a spiritual question.Perhaps the various experiences that these people went through was a necessary part of that discovery for them.I think movies like this can be educational if they make people think about the implications, complexities, and possible outcomes of getting involved in intimate relationships.  She perhaps underestimated the feelings that her two friends still had for each other.The two main female characters in this movie are bisexual but this is not a graphic movie.

1052179,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000N2H8XC,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 8]","Allegra (Elizabeth Reaser, ""The Family Stone"" but probably more recognizable as ""Jane Doe"" from last season of ""Grey's Anatomy"") has commitment issues, which explains why her girlfriend, Samantha (Julianne Nicholson, ""Little Black Book""), has dumped her.  However, she ends up questioning both her sexuality and her sanity when she falls for Philip (Justin Kirk, ""Weeds"").  Yes, he is a man, but he is a college professor capable of engaging in verbal sparring and he actually likes opera.  If that were not enough complication in her life, Allegra, begins a relationship with another woman, Grace (Gretchen Mol, ""The Notorious Bettie Page""), who has just broken up with her boyfriends of six years and never been with a woman before.  But, wait, there is more.  Grace's ex-boyfriend is Philip and as the ""Prologue"" of this 2006 film makes clear, yes, everything is going to hit the fan for Allegra in a big way.Actually, there is not a lot of Puccini in ""Puccini for Beginners,"" although some of the characters go to a production of ""Turandot"" at the beginning.  Philip takes Allegra to see ""Don  Giovanni,"" but that is Mozart.  In one of the deleted scenes the violinist on the street near the end was playing ""Nessun dorma,"" but that got gut at the end.  But then in the trailer the opera music is from ""La Donna e Mobile"" from ""Rigoletto,"" which is written by Verdi (I do not really think the aria's rant about the fickleness of women really fits the character, but the music is recognizable), which only goes to prove that you do not need to know a lot about Puccini to appreciate this screwball comedy.  To the extent that ""Turandot"" is an apt metaphor for what takes place (the way Richard Gere takes Julia Roberts to see ""La Traviata"" in ""Pretty Woman""), Allegra tells you all you need to know when she says the opera is about having to pass a test for the sake of love, with dire consequences if you fail.Yes, ""Allegra"" is the brand name of an antihistamine drug, the name of the heiress to the fashion house Versace, and the name of the illegitimate daughter of Lord Byron and Claire Clairmont (Mary Shelley's step-sister), but it is also an Italian name for a female meaning ""gay"" or ""happy.""  Such meanings have meaning for this movie because by thinking she is not the former our heroine may be ruining her chances to be the latter.  The name is also related to the musical tempo ""allegro,"" which means ""quick and lively"" or, literally, ""cheerful.""  That would also provide an ironic encapsulation of our heroine who has to be quick to juggle the two relationships, but does not have the time to be all that cheerful.Many viewers will be reminded more of Woody Allen movies that Puccini operas anyway, especially ""Annie Hall,"" what with the New York City location, the use of comic subtitles, strangers getting involved in commenting on the proceedings, and the idea that Allegra is not as smart as she thinks.  Fortunately, Reaser is not channeling Allen and her restrained performance keeps this one grounded as the complex situation drives towards its inevitable and painful collapse.  There are just a pair of deleted scenes and the original theatrical trailer included in the DVD extras, but the commentary track with director Maria Maggenti (""The Incredibly True Adventures of Two Girls in Love"") and editor Susan Graef does an above average job of focusing on how the film was made in terms of cutting, rewriting, and all the thousand natural decisions that making a film is heir to, especially when you only shoot for 18 days and have 8 weeks to edit  Final Note: I would not think of ""Holiday"" as being a screwball comedy, certainly not in the same league as ""Bringing Up Baby,"" and if you were going to reference a Katharine Hepburn film in this movie I would think ""Sylvia Scarlett"" is the (perhaps too) obvious choice.",4,What if a lesbian was to not only date a guy but also his ex-girlfiend?,1183593600,"07 5, 2007",2007,3843,"['Allegra', 'Elizabeth', 'Reaser', 'Family', 'Stone', 'probably', 'more', 'recognizable', 'Jane', 'Doe', 'last', 'season', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'commitment', 'issues', 'why', 'girlfriend', 'Samantha', 'Julianne', 'Nicholson', 'Little', 'Black', 'Book', 'dumped', 'However', 'up', 'questioning', 'sexuality', 'sanity', 'when', 'Philip', 'Justin', 'Kirk', 'Weeds', 'Yes', 'man', 'college', 'professor', 'capable', 'engaging', 'verbal', 'sparring', 'actually', 'opera', 'were', 'not', 'enough', 'complication', 'life', 'Allegra', 'relationship', 'woman', 'Grace', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', 'Notorious', 'Bettie', 'Page', 'who', 'just', 'broken', 'up', 'boyfriends', 'six', 'years', 'never', 'been', 'woman', 'wait', 'more', 'Grace', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Philip', 'Prologue', '2006', 'film', 'clear', 'yes', 'everything', 'going', 'hit', 'fan', 'Allegra', 'big', 'way.Actually', 'not', 'lot', 'Puccini', 'Puccini', 'Beginners', 'characters', 'go', 'production', 'Turandot', 'beginning', 'Philip', 'Allegra', 'see', 'Don', 'Giovanni', 'Mozart', 'one', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'violinist', 'street', 'end', 'was', 'playing', 'Nessun', 'dorma', 'got', 'gut', 'end', 'then', 'trailer', 'opera', 'music', 'La', 'Donna', 'e', 'Mobile', 'Rigoletto', 'written', 'Verdi', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'think', 'aria', 'rant', 'fickleness', 'women', 'really', 'character', 'music', 'recognizable', 'only', 'prove', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'know', 'lot', 'Puccini', 'appreciate', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'extent', 'Turandot', 'apt', 'metaphor', 'what', 'place', 'way', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'see', 'La', 'Traviata', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'Allegra', 'need', 'know', 'when', 'opera', 'having', 'pass', 'test', 'sake', 'love', 'dire', 'consequences', 'fail.Yes', 'Allegra', 'brand', 'name', 'antihistamine', 'drug', 'name', 'heiress', 'fashion', 'house', 'Versace', 'name', 'illegitimate', 'daughter', 'Lord', 'Byron', 'Claire', 'Clairmont', 'Mary', 'Shelley', 'step-sister', 'also', 'Italian', 'name', 'female', 'meaning', 'gay', 'happy', 'Such', 'meanings', 'have', 'meaning', 'movie', 'thinking', 'not', 'former', 'heroine', 'may', 'be', 'ruining', 'chances', 'be', 'latter', 'name', 'also', 'related', 'musical', 'tempo', 'allegro', 'quick', 'lively', 'literally', 'cheerful', 'would', 'also', 'provide', 'ironic', 'encapsulation', 'heroine', 'who', 'be', 'quick', 'juggle', 'two', 'relationships', 'not', 'have', 'time', 'be', 'cheerful.Many', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'reminded', 'more', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movies', 'Puccini', 'operas', 'anyway', 'especially', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'what', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'location', 'use', 'comic', 'subtitles', 'strangers', 'getting', 'involved', 'commenting', 'proceedings', 'idea', 'Allegra', 'not', 'as', 'smart', 'Fortunately', 'Reaser', 'not', 'channeling', 'Allen', 'restrained', 'performance', 'one', 'grounded', 'complex', 'situation', 'inevitable', 'painful', 'collapse', 'are', 'just', 'pair', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'included', 'DVD', 'extras', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'Maria', 'Maggenti', 'Incredibly', 'True', 'Adventures', 'Two', 'Girls', 'Love', 'editor', 'Susan', 'Graef', 'above', 'average', 'job', 'focusing', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'terms', 'cutting', 'rewriting', 'thousand', 'natural', 'decisions', 'making', 'film', 'heir', 'especially', 'when', 'only', 'shoot', '18', 'days', 'have', '8', 'weeks', 'edit', 'Final', 'Note', 'would', 'not', 'think', 'Holiday', 'being', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'certainly', 'not', 'same', 'league', 'Bringing', 'Up', 'Baby', 'were', 'going', 'reference', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'film', 'movie', 'would', 'think', 'Sylvia', 'Scarlett', 'perhaps', 'too', 'obvious', 'choice']",N/A

1052182,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000N2H8XC,Roland E. Zwick,"[13, 18]","**1/2Written and directed by Maria Maggenti, ""Puccini For Beginners"" is a tres chic romantic comedy set in a movie-spawned Manhattan where virtually everyone we meet is Caucasian, trendily upscale and sexually conflicted.The strained setup lands somewhere between a labored screwball sex farce and a recycled Woody Allen angst-fest:  Allegra (Elizabeth Reaser) is an opera-loving, afraid-of-commitment lesbian who finds herself inadvertently and simultaneously dating both a man (Justin Kirk) and his longtime girlfriend (winningly played by Gretchen Mol).  As Allegra bounces back and forth between her two oblivious paramours, the characters talk out the issues of their relationships as if they were channeling left-over bits from ""Annie Hall"" or ""Manhattan.""""Puccini for Beginners"" is one of those small-scale independent features that thinks it's being smarter and more insightful about romantic relationships than it really is.  Actually, after all those really sharp Woody Allen exposes on the same subject, very little in this film feels like fresh observation.  To be truthful, with the exception of Mol's winsome Grace, most of the characters here are more annoying than they are appealing.  Not only are the plotting and much of the writing too cutesy by half, but so is Maggenti's directorial style, which relies heavily on smart-alecky narration, freeze-framing, and dopey fantasy sequences to generate laughs.""Puccini for Beginners"" offers a few genuinely funny moments within its blessedly short 81-minute running time, but throughout we're plagued by the nagging and irreverent suspicion that the film might have been more accurately entitled ""Puccini for Idiots.""",2,Woody Allen for Beginners,1187308800,"08 17, 2007",2007,1680,"['**1/2Written', 'directed', 'Maria', 'Maggenti', 'Puccini', 'Beginners', 'tres', 'chic', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'set', 'movie-spawned', 'Manhattan', 'where', 'virtually', 'everyone', 'meet', 'Caucasian', 'trendily', 'upscale', 'sexually', 'conflicted.The', 'strained', 'setup', 'lands', 'somewhere', 'labored', 'screwball', 'sex', 'farce', 'recycled', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'angst-fest', 'Allegra', 'Elizabeth', 'Reaser', 'opera-loving', 'afraid-of-commitment', 'lesbian', 'who', 'inadvertently', 'simultaneously', 'dating', 'man', 'Justin', 'Kirk', 'longtime', 'girlfriend', 'winningly', 'played', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', 'Allegra', 'back', 'forth', 'two', 'oblivious', 'paramours', 'characters', 'talk', 'issues', 'relationships', 'were', 'channeling', 'left-over', 'bits', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Manhattan', 'Puccini', 'Beginners', 'one', 'small-scale', 'independent', 'features', 'being', 'smarter', 'more', 'insightful', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'really', 'Actually', 'really', 'sharp', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'same', 'subject', 'very', 'little', 'film', 'feels', 'fresh', 'observation', 'be', 'truthful', 'exception', 'Mol', 'winsome', 'Grace', 'most', 'characters', 'here', 'are', 'more', 'annoying', 'are', 'appealing', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'plotting', 'much', 'writing', 'too', 'cutesy', 'half', 'so', 'Maggenti', 'directorial', 'style', 'heavily', 'smart-alecky', 'narration', 'freeze-framing', 'dopey', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'generate', 'laughs', 'Puccini', 'Beginners', 'few', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'moments', 'blessedly', 'short', '81-minute', 'running', 'time', ""'re"", 'plagued', 'nagging', 'irreverent', 'suspicion', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'accurately', 'entitled', 'Puccini', 'Idiots']",N/A
