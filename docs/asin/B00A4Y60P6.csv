Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","Someday the Hallmark Channel will broadcast a movie that's not in the least family-inclusive, and that'll be a sign that the end times are upon us. But no worries for now. Hallmark still keeps it family-oriented. There's a comfort in knowing that the network's there for when I'm jonesing for something clean and wholesome and for when my nana comes visiting. PUPPY LOVE, which aired in 2012, is a fine example of Hallmark cinema. It doesn't chop you at the knees with an influx of coarse or seedy elements. It doesn't have foul language or violence for violence's sake. PUPPY LOVE is predictable, yeah, but amiable and fun in an uncomplicated way.Megan Nolan (Candace Cameron Bure) is a single mother and also a professor who's landed a job at the Roanfield University. But her 10-year-old daughter Caitlin (Katie L. Hawkins) is desolate over their having to relocate to Roanfield.Minor league baseball player Ben Fuller (Victor Webster) lives in Roanfield. When not playing on the road, Ben hangs out with his rambunctious dog Jake. The plot properly kicks off when Jake negotiates his way thru a door and out the house. He ends up impounded at the animal shelter just as Megan decides to get Caitlin a pet to hopefully spring her from her sad mopes. Now, can the baseball player and the professor (and her daughter) share custody of Jake without driving each other bananas?No surprise, much of the humor comes from the messes that Jake, that undisciplined dog, gets into. See, Ben is an easy-going sort who treats his dog more like a person than a pet. Meanwhile, Megan's real big on making sure that Jake receives proper behavioral training. And, now, look, she's got an obedience clicker and all. So it's the expected personality clash between our two grown-up leads. How can romance possibly come out of this? But it will if only the writers stick to the Hallmark playbook. Candace Cameron Bure is likable as the ""grown-up"" of the lot. The love story's okay. But Victor Webster's interactions with the kid actress, Katie L. Hawkins, are what make the movie work for me. The dog is shaggy and adorable. Expect mayhem with shoes and sudsy doggy bathtub dips and the hazards of leaving meat unattended on the chopping table.

1605891,A3LNU3T5H9OMWC,B00A4Y60P6,P. Romance,"[4, 4]","Megan Nolan's daughter, Caitlin, was struggling to adjust to their new home.  With a spur of the moment decision, Megan decided to get her a dog.  What she didn't expect that her daughter would go towards the most unruly, biggest dog at the shelter.  Ben Fuller had return home from a baseball game when he found that his dog, Jake, had run away.  When he found that his dog was adopted to Megan, he was determine to get his friend back.  But Caitlin loved Jake as much as Ben.  Maybe joint custody was the best way to go.Okay.  I'm going to ignore the fact that the animal shelter did not make the normal effort to search for Jake's owner before just putting him up for adoption.  And I'm also going to overlook the fact that the shelter gave a stranger the address of their adopter, instead of calling her to return of said dog.  Once I got passed the set up for their meeting, I found this movie to quite cute and charming.  I will admit the plot was pretty predictable.  It's pretty much like watching a gentle romance book.  But sometimes, I like the fact that I know what's going to happen.  This was a pretty straightforward movie.  There were no bad guys.  No unnecessary misunderstandings.  Not a lot of drama.  However, you will have plenty of humor (the 'heel' scene was a riot) and sweet scenes.The casting was spot on.  Especially our hero.  Jake, played by Victor Webster, is a total hottie and sweetie.  When a man loves his dog that much and good with kids, dare I say drool-worthy.  Hallmark knows how to create heroes.  Megan, played by Candace Cameron Bure, is good in her role as well.  But the side characters - Megan's best friend, Jake's best friend, Caitlin and Jake the dog - really kept this movie going.  Without them, things would definitely be at a standstill.  The acting was not cheesy or over the top.If you are a fan of sweet romances and don't mind predictability, this is the movie for you.  Great casting, good acting and a simple plot were major points in its favor.  And since the movie is clean and wholesome, the entire family can watch.  The most you will get is kissing near the end.  However, if you are looking for something with drama, different and/or with action, pass this one by.  It might be a little boring for you.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because as much as I like it, this isn't a movie I would watch over and over again.  But definitely, a good movie that deserves a spot on my shelf.",4,Puppy Love.
