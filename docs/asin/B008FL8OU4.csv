1551839,A1DS5AROCQZ4L6,B008FL8OU4,40yo Average American White Guy,"[1, 2]","There's something here, almost: lots of good ideas are toyed with in the first half, and it kept my attention. The premise, a neighborhood that lives in fear of its paperboy, is way creepier than you would think. The way the ""kid"" seems to be able to be everywhere, flickering around, there and gone, all that works: I found myself really wanting to grab ahold of that slippery little punk. There's even a character, the boyfriend, who acts out that frustration for us. And it does a good job of letting you consider on whether the paperboy is just a sociopath, or something darker, something evil and intangible, that collects your personal nightmares and then inflicts them on you...It's going well, until every character becomes... horror-movie stupid. Cops who refuse to believe, even when there's plenty of evidence. Heroes who confront bad-guys with no plan. Heroines who decide to stay in the cursed house and... take a shower before running for their lives. On and on. By the time it's almost over, I was wondering whether the police were somehow in on it all, they were acting so stupid.The ""twist"" ending probably does explain the movie, if I cared enough to think about it, but who cares? By the end, I didn't. A shame: somebody could rework this into something actually scary.",3,Effectively Creepy.

Victor Salva establishes a tolerable main character in Rose McGowan and the paperboy was bizarre and creepy.  His black eyes made for a strange and lasting image.  However, once the premise is set up (McGowan moves back into her old neighborhood to discover that the paperboy is regarded as an evil local figure), the movie moves distressingly into thriller movie cliches.  There is no explanation as to the nature of the paperboy (where he comes from, what his motivations are, if he's even human).  I didn't really mind this, as I like a bit of ambiguity in films like this.  However, the plot of the film after the initial set-up, failed to hold my interest.  The film becomes redundant and murky in its plot and we don't really even get any good B-Movie kills or scares.  I will admit, however, that I did enjoy the film for its mysteriousness and atmosphere.

1551845,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B008FL8OU4,Doug Park,"[2, 2]","Though the plot is a half-baked mess from start to finish, ""Rosewood Lane"" is well-filmed and fairly well-acted with a good script. Rose McGowan aptly plays Dr. Sonny Blake, a famous psychiatrist and radio talk show host who also, though it never really comes into play and doesn't serve much purpose in the film, leads a support group for troubled teens. Daniel Ross Owens adequately plays Derek Barber, the sinister, apparently superhuman paperboy in the neighborhood where Dr. Blake has just moved into her childhood home after her abusive alcoholic father dies from an ""accidental"" fall down the stairs to the basement.The first hour teeter-totters between being truly suspenseful and truly laughable. The biggest problem is that Barber appears way too often: The creators seem to have forgotten that what is NOT shown (particularly when it comes to boogeymen) is often more important than what is. More back-story on Dr. Blake's childhood would be helpful, as would some hint or nuance of who or what Barber really is and what his motivations are for harassing and sometimes injuring or even killing certain people. (Is he REALLY haunting Dr. Ross simply because she declined to buy a 'paper subscription from him?)The tension increases toward the end, even though it would appear that the directors and writers were a little unclear on the best way to end this film. There are many other loose ends: e.g., Can't they at least attempt to trace Derek's phone calls and webposts?I keep waiting for a someone to put out a totally new, well-developed and destined-for-classic horror-suspense film.

1551846,A3942G0XBGQHRW,B008FL8OU4,Greg Johnson,"[0, 0]","This is an entertaining movie and I liked it.  The movie is simple on one level.  There is only the one evil, not a million screaming zombies, and I appreciated that.  Finally a film that is focused down.  But on another level this movie remains a mystery.  Unlike your standard story that establishes introductions first, conflict in the middle, and resolution in the end.  This movie for me leaves a lot of questions.  But I think Victor Salva intends that.  Many situations we run into in real life are never resolved.  We just get bits, pieces,and clips of what really happened. That must be what he wanted in Rosewood Lane.Rose McGowan (Sonny Blake) does a really cool radio talk show.  Her voice is low and soothing, and you can just picture her at 11:00 pm musing over the radio.  I just didn't appreciate her voice until this movie.  I was always more distracted by how she looks, so I forgot to listen.  Good job Rose.But then there is Derek Barber the kid without Irises.  He seems obsessed with Sonny and we're pretty sure he killed her father. What of him?.  I have watched this movie about four times and can't answer the question Derek Barber.  Did he have superhuman speed, strength and agility?.  Could he duplicate himself?  Did he bury Barret alive or possess his body? Where does he live? Parents? I need a sequel for this one.

After her alcoholic father's death, she decided to move back to her childhood home, but once she got back in her old neighborhood, she was immediately warned by her neighbor about the local paperboy who seemed to be a strange young sociopath with supernatural abilities. Unfortunately, the boy immediately took a special interest in her; and when he started calling her show, reciting eerie nursery rhymes, an unnerving game of cat-and-mouse begins. As the game dangerously escalated, she suddenly found herself in a terrifying all-out war, one that forced her to redefine her perception of sanity and had her fighting for her life.This is not a movie with pails of blood pouring out or tons of gore spewing about, but I thought it was a nice mild suspense thriller that reminded me of the Twilight Zone days. If you're into stories like that, then this is definitely one you wouldn't want to miss.This actually got a lot of negative review, but I thought it was quite nice. Something you'd love seeing on TV on a slow weekend, sort of thing. One of the many complaints made was the actor who played the antagonist and his being inappropriate to be cast as a paper boy. Granted, he doesn't look like a boy, but take into account his acting skills here, I thought he made a pretty good job on his role.The story itself isn't perfect, and yeah, some choices the characters made were a bit questionable, but isn't that how movie people have always been?

I wanted to like this film and I wish I could tell you that's different from all the other stalking films out there, but it's really not. The only things I found interesting about this film were the tremendous performance by Charmed's Rose McGowan, and it's unique ended, that really threw me for a loop. Normally when a film has an ending that surprises me, I love it, it makes the whole film for me, and while the curve at the end of Rosewood Lane was interesting, it wasn't enough to make up for a slow moving film that resembled half a dozen other movies. The story follows Radio Psychiatrist, Dr. Sonny Blake, and her move back into the old house she grew up in. The house holds many personal demons for her, so when she claims that someone is stalking her, the people close to her find it difficult to believe. As I said earlier, Rose McGowan was terrific and was really the only person of note in this film. It's a story you want to like, but things progress so slowly and are just so dull, that when the surprise ending happens, you're reaction is that it's kind of cool, but it doesn't make up for the predictability of the rest of this film. Stalker films are supposed to be the scariest form of Horror films, because it's a real thing that happens every day, unfortunately, Rosewood Lane doesn't have the writing or the performances to pull it off.

There is a lot of bad acting but the psychopath kid saves the movie and still keeps you on the edge of your seat. Sonny is a talk-show/psychiatrist who likes to state the obvious for people who like to be told what to do and do not think for themselves. She moves in her father's house who just died under mysterious circumstances, and according to the script was alcoholic and used to mistreat her when she was young. She works on her show every day until midnight. She has a boyfriend that lives in the city and comes to live with her. A paper boy shows up and becomes really annoying at the beginning. After a few minutes it becomes clear that the paper boy is really a psychopath and that he is after her. Her boyfriend is incapable of protecting her because he is to timid and to tentative. The cops are contacted but are really incompetent too. The paper boy's parents are covering for him.Many questions left unanswered. What happened to her boy friend? Where was he buried? How the kid on a bike can move him (assuming he is dead) so fast and so far? How come the psycho kids multiply at the end? The cops told Sony that they contacted the paper boy's family. Where are they? Why Sony didn't hit him with the baseball bat until his head exploded? Is he dead up there in the tree?  Who are the two kids at the funeral? Are they brothers, are they clones? In addition, she gets hit by an arrow in the back and she can still run, swing a baseball bat three times, and drive. Hum?!!!The film just ends and we are left scratching our heads. Did they run out of money? Finally, just a quick note on the facial expressions of Rose McGowan (...or the absence of). I never understood why people go through plastic surgery. But if you do and you spend all the money, make sure you end up being capable of moving your facial muscles. Her facial expressions throughout the movie are non-existent.
