902114,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00096S2TQ,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[15, 15]","I was really looking forward to trying Sexy Legs, as I tend to enjoy dance-inspired cardio as well as barre moves.  The outside of the DVD case does a nice job of breaking down the workout, listing time durations for each chapter as well each bonus segment.The main workout is 37 minutes long, and it begins with a 5-minute warm up.  In this section, instructor Leisa Hart introduces some of the ballet moves that will be used in the workout.  Next, there are two segments of ""Ballet Dance,"" each 10 minutes long.  I really liked the types of movements that Leisa was doing--eg, I love doing plies, knee lifts, kicks, and leg extensions--but overall, I did not enjoy this section of the workout.  Specifically, I thought that Leisa moved much too quickly, and as a result, the exercises felt both rushed and jerky.  In addition, Leisa did not cue very well and often failed to adequately explain the ballet terms she was using; the poor camera angles utilized further exacerbated this problem.  In each 10-minute segment, she introduces several different moves and then combines them into a longer routine, which she repeats several times from the top; each segment has a total of two longer routines.  Surprisingly, I did get a good cardio workout trying to keep up with the pace of the moves, but I did not find the dance work to be at all enjoyable; ""fussy"" seems like the best word to describe it.Following the dance segment, there is a 7-minute bar work section.  I expected this to be more focused on toning, but again, the pace was quite brisk, making it seem more like continued cardio work.  Leisa was difficult to follow here as well; even the background exercisers obviously were confused at several points.  The workout ends with a nice 5-minute stretching segment at the bar for a total of 37 minutes.The DVD bonus features included several additional workout segments.  There is a 5-minute ""scarf dance,"" which is a slower ballet dance segment incorporating use of scarves; a 5-minute ""intense stretch"" which contains many of the same stretches from the main workout but without the bar this time; and an additional 5 minutes of bar work which is slower and thus has more of a toning emphasis.  Other DVD features include a sneak peak of the class from a camera at the back of the stage, brief bios on Leisa and each of the four background exercisers, a music only workout option, and a photo gallery (why would I want to look at poses of Leisa in various outfits?).One final important thing to note about this workout is that Leisa and crew are wearing ""character shoes,"" a sort of heeled dance shoe that seems more appropriate to modern or jazz dance.  Leisa recommends that those at home do the workout in fitness sneakers, which is what I did, but this felt awkward with some of the ballet moves.  I really WANT to like this video, as I did feel it in my legs and thought that I got a good cardio workout overall--but after trying it only once, I don't think that I'm ever likely to do it again.  If you are already familiar with basic ballet moves and have a preference for quickly moving, complex cardio, you may like this workout, but otherwise, I am unable to recommend it.",3,"A ballet-inspired, mostly cardio workout to tone your lower body",1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,3195,"['was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'trying', 'Sexy', 'Legs', 'tend', 'enjoy', 'dance-inspired', 'cardio', 'as', 'well', 'barre', 'moves', 'outside', 'DVD', 'case', 'nice', 'job', 'breaking', 'down', 'workout', 'listing', 'time', 'durations', 'chapter', 'as', 'well', 'bonus', 'segment.The', 'main', 'workout', '37', 'minutes', 'long', '5-minute', 'warm', 'up', 'section', 'instructor', 'Leisa', 'Hart', 'ballet', 'will', 'be', 'used', 'workout', 'Next', 'are', 'two', 'segments', 'Ballet', 'Dance', '10', 'minutes', 'long', 'really', 'liked', 'types', 'movements', 'Leisa', 'was', 'doing', 'eg', 'love', 'doing', 'plies', 'knee', 'lifts', 'kicks', 'leg', 'extensions', 'overall', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'section', 'workout', 'Specifically', 'thought', 'Leisa', 'moved', 'much', 'too', 'quickly', 'result', 'exercises', 'felt', 'rushed', 'jerky', 'addition', 'Leisa', 'did', 'not', 'cue', 'very', 'well', 'often', 'failed', 'adequately', 'explain', 'ballet', 'terms', 'was', 'using', 'poor', 'camera', 'angles', 'utilized', 'further', 'exacerbated', 'problem', '10-minute', 'segment', 'several', 'different', 'moves', 'then', 'combines', 'longer', 'routine', 'several', 'times', 'top', 'segment', 'total', 'two', 'longer', 'routines', 'Surprisingly', 'did', 'get', 'good', 'cardio', 'workout', 'trying', 'keep', 'up', 'pace', 'moves', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'dance', 'work', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'fussy', 'best', 'word', 'describe', 'it.Following', 'dance', 'segment', '7-minute', 'bar', 'work', 'section', 'expected', 'be', 'more', 'focused', 'toning', 'again', 'pace', 'was', 'quite', 'brisk', 'making', 'seem', 'more', 'continued', 'cardio', 'work', 'Leisa', 'was', 'difficult', 'follow', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'background', 'exercisers', 'obviously', 'were', 'confused', 'several', 'points', 'workout', 'nice', '5-minute', 'stretching', 'segment', 'bar', 'total', '37', 'minutes.The', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'features', 'included', 'several', 'additional', 'workout', 'segments', '5-minute', 'scarf', 'dance', 'slower', 'ballet', 'dance', 'segment', 'incorporating', 'use', 'scarves', '5-minute', 'intense', 'stretch', 'many', 'same', 'stretches', 'main', 'workout', 'bar', 'time', 'additional', '5', 'minutes', 'bar', 'work', 'slower', 'thus', 'more', 'toning', 'emphasis', 'Other', 'DVD', 'features', 'include', 'sneak', 'peak', 'class', 'camera', 'back', 'stage', 'brief', 'bios', 'Leisa', 'four', 'background', 'exercisers', 'music', 'only', 'workout', 'option', 'photo', 'gallery', 'why', 'would', 'want', 'look', 'poses', 'Leisa', 'various', 'outfits', '.One', 'final', 'important', 'thing', 'note', 'workout', 'Leisa', 'crew', 'are', 'wearing', 'character', 'shoes', 'sort', 'heeled', 'dance', 'shoe', 'more', 'appropriate', 'modern', 'jazz', 'dance', 'Leisa', 'home', 'do', 'workout', 'fitness', 'sneakers', 'what', 'did', 'felt', 'awkward', 'ballet', 'moves', 'really', 'WANT', 'like', 'video', 'did', 'feel', 'legs', 'thought', 'got', 'good', 'cardio', 'overall', 'trying', 'only', 'once', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'m"", 'ever', 'likely', 'do', 'again', 'are', 'already', 'familiar', 'basic', 'ballet', 'moves', 'have', 'preference', 'quickly', 'moving', 'complex', 'cardio', 'may', 'like', 'workout', 'otherwise', 'am', 'unable', 'recommend']",Sexy Legs with Leisa Hart

The workout is fairly challenging ( the moves may seem difficult for someone who never tried dancing ) and it will definitely take some time before I can move thru the routine as gracefully as the instructor does.. One thing was particularly important for me - after completing the workout, I could feel my muscles, but my knees were not hurting ( as they usually do after a ballet-inspired class - I have several DVDs on my shelf that I cannot use because of that ).The only problem I had were my shoes - I used my trainers but I found they gave me too firm grip in some of the sliding moves.",5,love it!,1151452800,"06 28, 2006",2006,676,"['third', 'DVD', 'Leisa', 'Hart', ""'m"", 'glad', 'say', 'am', 'not', 'disappointed', 'workout', 'fairly', 'challenging', 'moves', 'may', 'seem', 'difficult', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'tried', 'dancing', 'will', 'definitely', 'take', 'time', 'can', 'move', 'thru', 'routine', 'as', 'gracefully', 'instructor', 'One', 'thing', 'was', 'particularly', 'important', 'completing', 'workout', 'could', 'feel', 'muscles', 'knees', 'were', 'not', 'hurting', 'usually', 'do', 'ballet-inspired', 'class', 'have', 'several', 'DVDs', 'shelf', 'can', 'not', 'use', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'were', 'shoes', 'used', 'trainers', 'found', 'gave', 'too', 'firm', 'grip', 'sliding', 'moves']",Sexy Legs with Leisa Hart

You can choose whether or not to do additional hops etc for extra burn.  The toning section is all standing barre work (you may need a good sturdy chair).

You'll begin each new move with her telling you the name but you spend all your time trying to learn the moves that you might forget the names.
