I have been watching seasons 1-5 over and over.Waiting.......I am getting a little annoyed when I invest in a season (s) of DVDs with the intention of making a full set and they stop!!!! Frankly, it is BS! Why bother releasing the first season of a show and stop? Money yes????? I am sure Sony/Shout or whoever would know ahead of time that there would be difficulty with a certain season but they tease fans anyway.I am waiting to complete my series of The Facts of Life (and from the sounds of it, that will never happen). I bought the first season of Who's the Boss years ago and have never seen season 2. I just purchased the first season of Maude and now am reading that season 2 may never be released.I am thinking this is just wrong!
