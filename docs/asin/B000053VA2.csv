565512,A2I17T9XB6LSGW,B000053VA2,Andrew McCaffrey,"[7, 8]","Set Three of A&amp;E's The Prisoner series features three episodes of the television program and an interesting interview with the production manager for the show, Bernie Williams.  I won't spend too much time talking about the individual episodes.  If you've seen the series before, then you know exactly how good they are.  If you haven't seen them, then you owe it to yourself to view them.  The transfer to DVD was very well done with nice little touches added in the menu pages.  The video is excellent and the sound is superb; Number Six has never looked better.The three episodes here are a great representation of the series.  In THE SCHIZOID MAN, the Prisoner is confronted by an agent sent to test his own sense of identity. This episode is excellent and mind-bending; it definitely deserves several viewings on its own.The interview with Bernie Williams may be a bit light for the hardcore fanatics, but as a casual fan of the series I found it to be quite enlightening and interesting.  Williams goes over the creation of some of the classic show elements such as Rover and the various Number Twos.",5,Television's best,988156800,"04 25, 2001",2001,1110,"['Set', 'Three', 'A', 'amp', 'E', 'Prisoner', 'series', 'features', 'three', 'episodes', 'television', 'program', 'interesting', 'interview', 'production', 'manager', 'show', 'Bernie', 'Williams', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'talking', 'individual', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'series', 'then', 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'good', 'are', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'then', 'owe', 'view', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'nice', 'little', 'touches', 'added', 'menu', 'pages', 'video', 'excellent', 'sound', 'superb', 'Number', 'Six', 'never', 'looked', 'better.The', 'three', 'episodes', 'here', 'are', 'great', 'representation', 'series', 'THE', 'SCHIZOID', 'MAN', 'Prisoner', 'confronted', 'agent', 'sent', 'test', 'own', 'sense', 'identity', 'episode', 'excellent', 'mind-bending', 'definitely', 'several', 'viewings', 'own.The', 'interview', 'Bernie', 'Williams', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'light', 'hardcore', 'fanatics', 'casual', 'fan', 'series', 'found', 'be', 'quite', 'enlightening', 'interesting', 'Williams', 'creation', 'classic', 'show', 'elements', 'such', 'Rover', 'various', 'Number', 'Twos']",N/A
565513,A36RRLVEBABY5Z,B000053VA2,"Axel Law ""The Happy Seizure Kid""","[2, 2]","Back in 1967, an allegorical television show emerged that has yet to be topped by any other English television series. The show: The Prisoner. Starring Patrick McGoohan, he plays the role of No. 6, a former secret service agent who resigned for unknown reasons and then finds himself knocked unconscious and trapped in a seemingly peaceful place called &quot;the Village.&quot; Each episode features a new No. 2 (with a few exceptions), who watches his every move and strives to find out why he resigned. The only superior is the unseen No. 1, the supposed ruler of the Village. The only other characters that reoccur are The Supervisor (also called Controller), played by Peter Stanwick, and The Butler, played by Angelo Muscat.In &quot;The Schizoid Man,&quot; Number 6's behavorial patterns are altered and he's convinced that he's Number 12 impersonating as Number 6.  An interesting story that tests Number 6's individuality is among the best in the series.  My favorite part: Number 2 tells him the &quot;password&quot; is Gemini.  When he's confronted by street thugs and they ask for the password, he defiantly tells them &quot;Jiminy.&quot;In &quot;Many Happy Returns,&quot; the Village is seemingly deserted.  He escapes, only to find that his superiors don't trust his motives.  Still, a surprising plot twist makes his escape seem irrelevant... ah well, watch it and see for yourself.In &quot;It's Your Funeral,&quot; Number 6 learns of a plot to assassinate a former Number 2.  He doesn't believe it, thinking they're at him again as to why he resigned.  Is it a trap, or the work of &quot;jammers&quot;?  This one's pretty complex when it comes to the murder plot, but it unravels nicely in the end.The DVDs include an interview with Bernie Williams, the series' production manager and line producer.  It's pretty insightful, as he stated that Patrick McGoohan had total control of the show (just because the show got weirder as it went along DOES NOT mean he had little control to begin with...) and it's comforting to know that most people involved with the show didn't even know what it was all about (Bernie said that it was &quot;all in Patrick's head.&quot;).Here is where I agreed with A&amp;E's episode placement.  You can tell the Village administration growing desperate overtime and since the two aforementioned episodes are back to back episodes, it would only seem logical.  Also, we're halfway through the series and the original airdate had &quot;Many Happy Returns&quot; BEFORE &quot;Checkmate,&quot; which in the episode, Number 2 says &quot;the early recruit.&quot;  EARLY EPISODE, peoples.When Number 6 escaped from the Village, the world that we know that exists outside of the Village seemed not all that different... which goes to show you that the Village could be ANYWHERE, even the place that you live in.  Perhaps this was to instill the idea into Number 6's head that he might be better off in the Village?  Nevertheless, his individuality remained intact and still yearned to be free.Many people have compared Number 6 to John Drake (Secret Agent Man).  Sure, they're both played by Patrick McGoohan and act similar, but are they the same?  I don't believe so.  As I have stated in my review for Set 1, I believe McGoohan meant for us to &quot;fill Number 6's shoes.&quot; In other words, we too are prisoners in society, caught in a social order that we can't break from.I give every episode a 5 star rating, but I HIGHLY recommend you get the megaset instead of the individual volumes.  This show is one that must be seen to believe.",5,&quot;Smith.  Peter...

565515,A24VVTYRN7BBI3,B000053VA2,David H. Downing,"[3, 3]","If you're not familiar with THE PRISONER, it concerns a secret agent who resigns his position, and is immediately transported to a most unusual prison camp known as The Village, where he is designated ""No. 6.""  His captors go to increasingly drastic measures to find out why he resigned, as he struggles to find out who they are, where he is, and how he can escape. There is a resolution, but of a surrealistic, allegorical nature that you must be prepared for.I'd first like to mention that it was my mother who introduced me to Patrick McGoohan's enigmatic television classic, and who got me the original MPI VHS edition.  I'm saying this in memory of her, since she passed away in April 2004, and her interest in THE PRISONER belongs in her eulogy.Fortunately, she got to see the interview with production manager Bernie Williams in this third installment of the A&E; DVD release.  Williams candidly discusses many aspects of the show, including what McGoohan was like to work with, the origin of Rover, and the various ordeals of filming. This bonus feature also includes the Prisoner theme music in surround sound -- unlike the episodes themselves, which are presented in their original mono mix.  My only complaint is the absence of footage to illustrate  Wilson's points.  For this, you must watch the ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette in set #5, narrated by Williams.  I wish that featurette and this interview had been combined.""Schizoid Man"" is one of my favorite episodes, even though it's not one of the ""essential"" seven, as defined by McGoohan.  It's also a good example of a key point Williams makes during the interview; you can't watch THE PRISONER with half your mind on something else.  I got royally confused by this episode the first time around because I wasn't paying close enough attention during the first several minutes.  The reigning No. 2 attempts to break No. 6 by confronting him with a double -- No. 12 (also played by McGoohan) -- who does a better job of being him than he does.  But No. 2 doesn't merely send this Doppelganger to haunt No. 6.  The Doppelganger is only part of a master plan that involves brainwashing No. 6 while altering both his appearance and his environment.  The idea is to trap No. 6 in both an internal and external illusion that HE is the impostor brought in to destroy the sanity of the real thing.I find the episode interesting because it indirectly foreshadows the  ultimate resolution of the series -- if you can can call it that.  Unfortunately, I can't say any more, lest I give too much away.  If you're familiar with the series, you know what I'm getting at.  This episode also seems to suggest that Rover is a sentient life form, rather than just a machine.  After all, it seems capable of getting confused.  Or DID it get confused?  Did it perhaps decide to betray its masters for some reason?  (BTW, this is the only episode where Rover actually gets called by name.)Alas, this is one place where I feel A&E;'s revised order causes problems.  Placing ""Schizoid Man"" AFTER ""Dance of the Dead,"" in which No. 6 suffers much abuse at the hands of women, makes it almost impossible to believe that he would befriend and trust Alison. Furthermore, I don't completely agree that ""Schizoid Man"" must come after ""The General.""  Yes ""The General"" includes another No. 12, who has been in The Village a long time, so it can't come IMMEDIATELY after ""Schizoid Man,"" but if enough episodes separated these two, it wouldn't be a problem.But I also had two intrinsic problems with ""Schizoid Man.""  First, it's hard to believe that No. 6's captors would have let him keep that photograph that clues him in to what they've done to him.  In fact, it's hard to believe that photograph wouldn't have simply gotten lost in the shuffle.  Second, it's hard to believe No. 12 would have fallen apart so easily at the end.  Still one of my favorite episodes, though.At one point, I mistakenly believed that ""Many Happy Returns"" was one of the ""essential"" episodes, as defined by McGoohan.  It has a bit of the surrealistic feel of those episodes, and it introduces an idea that comes back in the final episode -- that No. 6 may be able to leave the Village, but will never truly escape it for reasons that I can't elaborate on, again lest I give too much away.  There's even an appearance of that mysterious black car driven by the man who originally gassed No. 6.  The surrealism lies in the fact that No. 6 wakes up one morning to find The Village mysteriously deserted and with all utilities turned off.  How this was managed overnight is never explained.  Of course, No. 6 takes advantage of this strange turn of events to escape -- and actually makes it back to England.  Since the series is less than half over at this point, it goes without saying that he doesn't stay free.  But I am left feeling that he COULD HAVE stayed free if he had been willing to forget about the ""why"" of it all and simply enjoy his freedom.  But he HAS to investigate ...""It's Your Funeral"" is one of the episodes I think of as ""side trips.""  No. 6 neither tries to escape nor endures any further attempts by his captors to find out why he resigned.  The episode concerns an elaborate plot to assassinate a No. 2 who's outlived his usefulness -- and to discredit No. 6, whose warning is the only one that the intended victim might have taken seriously.  This isn't one of my favorite episodes because it's too much of a digression, but even my least favorite PRISONER episodes have much more of my respect than most what you find on commercial television.",5,What was Patrick McGoohan really like?

565516,A9MAUO67ABVOB,B000053VA2,"F. Behrens ""Frank Behrens""","[9, 13]","You had best watch the second offering on the first DVD of Set 3 of &lt;The Prisoner&gt; to get the shocking news that none of us original fans could figure out what was going on because Patrick McGoohan himself began filming before he could figure it all out! Still what fun we had back in the 1960s when this Kafka-cum-Orwell series first came to our US tellies. All this and more is revealed in an all too short interview with Bernie Williams, the Production Manager for the series. Thank you, A&amp;E, for including that.The first section of that DVD treats us to the popular episode titled &quot;The Schizoid Man&quot; in which Number 6 gets to fight with himself in several excellently handled sequences as the nasty Number 2 (Anton Rodgers) tries to convince him the other Prisoner is really Number 6 while he is the specially prepared Number 12 (double six, get it?). Even the Rovers are confused at this one. Good fun all around here.&quot;Many Happy Returns&quot; has no logic whatsoever. The Village is deserted entirely solely to let Number 6 escape by raft. He is nearly murdered by two Germans who find him after 18 days of exposure (are they part of the plan? and if not why did the Village risk his being killed?), gets back to London and finds his house there occupied and car driven by a very friendly middle-aged woman (Georgina Cookson). The twist ending makes no sense whatsoever because we are never told the purpose of the exercise other than the usual &quot;You see once again you can never escape us.&quot;&quot;It's Your Funeral&quot; actually involves two Number 2s, one of whom is planning to assassinate the outgoing one, thereby putting Number 6 in the strange situation of trying to save the latter to prevent punishment being dealt out to the innocent Villagers. One of the more interesting episodes.Set 4 begins with &quot;A Change of Mind&quot; with a particularly revolting Number 2 (John Sharpe), a most attractive Bad Girl (Angela Browne), and an all too pat reaction from the Villagers at the end that is simply out of touch with what has gone before it.  In &quot;Hammer into Anvil,&quot; we have a Number 2 (Patrick Garghill) who is so paranoid that he cannot see through the very obvious reign of terror that Number 6 perpetuates--and again the script stretches our credulity too far.The next two episodes, however, are both the most clever and completely different ones before &quot;The Girl Who Was Death,&quot; which holds its own special place in the series. In &quot;Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling,&quot; we have our star appear only in flashbacks and at the very end. In order to find a Scientist who has perfected a mind-transfer device right out of the old sci fi flicks of the 30s (not to mention an exceptional entry in &quot;The Avengers&quot; series), they put Number 6's mind into the body of a Bad One (Nigel Stock). Therefore it is Stock who plays the main character here--but with The Prisoner's mind, mind you--who eventually leads Number 2 and company to the scientist. (This plot was made necessary when McGoohan had to be away to film &quot;Ice Station Zebra.&quot;)Possibly the most talked-about episode (with the possible exception of the last two) is &quot;Living in Harmony.&quot; Here Number 6 has been translated into a sheriff resigning his position at the beginning in an alternate-universe version of the expected opening, and turns to violence only to save a beautiful woman. In short, his virtue is turned into a vice by his Wardens. This episode contains the first of two appearances by Alexis Kanner, who will share star billing in the very last episode.

No matter. It's fun to sometimes be confused by this one and to see how #6 will once again outsmart his enemies.  ""Many Happy Returns"" is another crafty episode with absolutely no dialogue coming for several minutes into the show. With a deserted village is this now #6's chance to escape?  Finally, ""It's Your Funeral"" has #6 ironically on the side of #2 after he learns of a conspiracy to assassinate his top nemesis in the village. But is it legit or is #6 the one being outsmarted?  As usual, it's fun to watch every little detail unfold.  On video, it just wouldn't be the same.

565519,A3ADJVRAPJC6KZ,B000053VA2,Michael Meunier,"[2, 2]","There are a few reasons why this set could stand on its own without the entire series. It lands the viewer squarely in the middle of the drama, it contains an interview about the series from production manager Bernie Williams, and the episodes explain more about the community environment of the village...The Schizoid Man, the first of these episodes, is a great episode because it pits No. 6 against his most irritating foe yet- himself! Their sparring (both physically and mentally) is hilarious, as the doppelganger gives No. 6 a taste of his own self-righteous medicine.Many Happy Returns, the next episode on the set, may be my personal favorite (except for maybe Fallout). It takes the main action away from The Village and shows No. 6 at the peak of his skills. I don't want to give anything away, but the ending is a real stinker for No. 6 ;)It's Your Funeral is, in my opinion, one of the weaker offerings of the series- but it makes a good finale for this set. However, the introduction to and ending of the story are well handled and the fellow who plays No. 2 is a riot. He thinks he sooo smart, and he is... but smarter than No. 6? Don't count on it...Although the set only has three episodes, the final one detracting somewhat from the epic scope of the show- it still earns its five stars for The Schizoid Man and Many Happy Returns. And It's Your Funeral still deserves four to four and half stars anyhow.
