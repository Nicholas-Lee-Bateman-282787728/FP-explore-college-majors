I selected it because I could view it free (Prime) and I wanted to watch something before I went to sleep. I thought it might be a sort of a throw-away if I fell asleep while watching. But it grabbed me from the beginning with characters you wanted to learn more about. I also thought it might be a little smarmy or maybe even a little too rough, based on reviews, but I found it to be touching without going overboard and, though the old man is a bit salty, nothing he said or did was shocking. Maybe you wouldn't want to explain a couple of things to very young kids but for kids of about the same age as the young hero, I didn't see anything that raised my hackles. There are many worse movies with young protagonists. If they've got a grandfather or uncle who is sometimes a bit saltier than the norm, they've already been exposed to worse.

Great characters:  There's the kid who wants to climb a neighborhood tower about to be dismantled to see what nobody else can see; his father, who didn't serve in WWII and is considered a coward by some;  the super-patriotic next-door neighbor who did serve, suffers from shell shock (PTSD) and gets drunk regularly and shoots off his guns; the garrulous, agnostic old man dying of cancer who's trying to help the kid climb the tower in return for getting a gun to kill himself with.  Even the secondary characters are sketched beautifully, and the acting is virtually flawless.  The movie is basically about what real courage means, and who has it.I had a little problem with John Hurt, who played the dying old guy brilliantly except that his British accent kept bleeding through.
