I bought all his early 45s and then the LPs, and by now have collected the best CD masterings of all his good songs (not the movie filler).Some of his movies were mildly entertaining fluff (Follow That Dream, Kid Galahad); some were talky bores (Wild in the Country, Love Me Tender, King Creole); and Blue Hawaii spawned a dozen copycat color travelogues with thin plots and often thinner songs. In many of his movies, it was obvious that the producers couldn't decide whether they were presenting an actor or a singer. Eventually, Elvis sank to making sitcom-level, low-budget dreck like Kissin' Cousins and Harum Scarum.""Change of Habit"" is perhaps Elvis' worst movie: a shallow, confused, clich&eacute;-ridden, cardboard attempt to be ""relevant."" Virtually every scene is sickeningly bad, and that is coming from a lifelong admirer of Elvis Presley's talent.I guess the movies made a lot of money, but overall they were a detriment to the man's career.

Mary Tyler Moore is one of a trio of nuns who arrive in plainclothes to work undercover in Elvis' clinic. Much romance and social consciousness ensues, all of it presented so clumsily and wrongheadedly that it sometimes made my jaw drop in disbelief.A shy romance ensues between Moore and Elvis (who doesn't know that she is a nun), leading to the film's unbelievable concluding scene, in which...SPOILER!...Moore returns to the neighborhood's Catholic church. Unlike before, it is now a thriving center of worship led by Elvis singing and playing ""Let Us Pray"" (or something like that) on his guitar.

493130,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0000065M3,Ed Uyeshima,"[6, 11]","Rarely has there been as odd a coupling in the history of cinema as the one on exhibit here - Elvis Presley and Mary Tyler Moore - two more polar opposite personas could not have shared the screen in 1969 when this movie was released. In what turned out to be his last dramatic role, Presley looks fit as he was then riding the momentum from his legendary'68 Comeback Special, while Moore - looking very Mary Richards-like, at least in Season One - was floundering in cheap Universal movies (like this one) after her salad days as Laura Petrie onDick Van Dyke's classic sitcomand still a year away from her ownepochal TV series. Yet, Presley obviously felt the seasoned Moore (versus his standard gallery of vacuous starlets) would give him credibility as a more serious actor in a film that dealt with social issues albeit in a most unbelievable manner.Directed in journeyman TV-movie fashion by William A. Graham, the contrived story concerns three nuns, undercover as nurses in civilian clothing, who are sent on a mission to an inner city neighborhood to help the groovy Dr. John Carpenter, who runs a free clinic there when he's not singing and playing his guitar. Complications ensue as each sister finds it difficult to assimilate themselves into the community no thanks to a belligerent local pastor against their mission from the outset. The giggly Sister Barbara attempts to confront the local grocer to change his price-gouging ways, while the sullen Sister Irene feels conflicted about being a black woman amid the racial inequity of the real world. Sister Michelle, however, has the most palpable dilemma - should she remain faithful to the church or succumb to the charms of the doctor? If any of this could be taken seriously, there might have been a chance toward a grittier examination of social services to the marginalized. In an effort to stay topical, there is a discomfiting rape scene and an oversimplified treatment for autism called Rage Reduction.But all this effort is secondary since this is Elvis after all, and he has no facility as an actor to play anyone but himself. With his aggressive sideburns and skintight white jeans with matching shoes, he does not slip into any character that would be credibly living in the ghetto. However, he does sing four songs, of which only ""Rubberneckin'"" is worthy of a second listen. As Sister Michelle, Moore is overly earnest without her trademark irony - the Mary we love only shows up briefly during a touch football scene in the park. Singer Barbara McNair, deglamorized and barely cracking her famous smile, plays Sister Irene, while future soap opera villainess Jane Elliot plays Sister Barbara. Look for Ed Asner playing a progressive cop but sadly no scenes with Moore are offered. The only noteworthy extra on the 2002 DVD is the original theatrical trailer.

Who ever would have thought she'd be on Elvis' hot babe list?!! I miss the nuns of yesteryear in their habits, especially the ones at St Anthony's and the large hats of St Vincent de Paul nuns. Now you have slave women walking around in burkas all over the place instead!!! Not Christian nuns! The world's upsidedown! Thanks a lot, brain dead Ted! The murderer and blood sucking leech of the Senate that road into politics on the coattails of death and prospered much ever since! This movie brings back times of chaos and soul searching. Finding out who we were and changing times of very selfish people. We could have done without the songs in the film though. I do recommend this movie. It shows those who were not born to see the 60's & 70's what it was like, somewhat.

Before taking their vows, the novices have been ordered to take a walk on the wild side, late-Sixties style, with all the trite social commentary and mild sexual titillation a G rating will allow. As comely, full-lipped Sister Michelle, MTM joins the short list (with Julie Andrews and Sally Field) for the title of Hollywood's Most Wholesomely Hot Sister. Naturally, El is smitten with her and can't figure out why she would choose a life of poverty, chastity and obedience over his funky world of howlingly cartoonish ethnic stereotypes, perverts and other fun types.After this one, Elvis had the good sense to rip up his Screen Actors Guild card. Everybody say ""Amen!"" But seriously, it's a shame El's last feature film came a cropper. Buoyed by the success of his 1968 comeback special, the Big E looked fitter, less stoned and more handsome (sideburns notwithstanding) than he had in years. Elvis reportedly valued credibility as a serious actor over his natural gifts as a singer/entertainer. Instead of giving him a challenging role worthy of his born-again confidence, ""Change of Habit"" remains infamous for miscasting Elvis at a time when he was primed and ready to prove himself as an actor. Too bad.The flick IS watchable for its gallery of familiar faces, among them porcine character actor Robert Emhardt (immortal as blustery businessman Malcolm Tucker in ""The Andy Griffith Show's"" most essential episode, ""Man in a Hurry"") hamming it up as a crime kingpin. And the cop that looks remarkably like Ed Asner really is him. How both Asner and MTM managed to escape from the abyss of one of Elvis's most misguided films, only to achieve nirvana in a certain Minneapolis newsroom just a year later, is impressive and miraculous.This being one of Presley's ""serious"" movies, the soundtrack is lean, but there is one bizarro musical highlight: a piano-pounding Elvis jamming with MTM, self-consciously fingering a classical guitar like a doe caught in the spotlight, on what sounds like ""Lawdy Miss Clawdy.""

Strangely enough, ""Elvis Week"" played before Elvis was dead. The Beatles were the week before. I fell in love with both.I am now pushing 50 and I still love my Beatles and Elvis movies. I must have seen ""Change of Habit"" 50 times since I was a kid, and the more I see it, the better I like it. It is true some parts are ridiculous, including my pet beef that the nuns are wearing make-up, specifically eye-shadow, in the convent, prior to being ""released"" into the general population. I consider criticisms such as this ""chump change"" -- the kind of thing I can accept as long as the ""premise"" of the movie is reliable.Serious critics can pick apart many ""credibility"" moments in this movie. Much might appear ""dated."" But for me, I look for the ""soul"" of the movie; the serious intent of the characters -- and the actors behind the characters -- who put their soul into this movie to put forth ideals in ways they were not allowed in their mainstream professional lives.Elvis (privately) rated this one of the best movies he'd ever done, but, because it was his last movie and was not backed by a soundtrack, was considered by Col. Parker a failure, and therefore did not ""exist"" as a record of accomplishment financially or through social impact. People who ""study"" Elvis know he never cared about the ""bottom line"" dollar-wise; he always cared about people. In this movie, it shows.Lastly, and this may be a ""technical"" point, but this is the only movie I've ever seen that even remotely deals with what was called the Ecumenical Movement. I am not Catholic, or religious, but it seems to be that this movie takes on even a sliver of social and human rights issues that were taking place in the late 1960s that really weren't addressed at all until prior to the turn of the century, and is poised to be an issue under the current Papal administration, as I write this.This movie is not for everybody.

493152,A2Y1D4PNZ1G7IH,B0000065M3,Mike Kurosky,"[5, 6]","Ending his days in Hollywood with the type of dramatic role he always craved, Elvis gives an ironic twist to his movie career. Though it is not a particularly profound film , Change Of Habit does represent a change of pace for Elvis. A drama instead of a comedy, this film featured only three songs. Elvis stars a Dr. John Carpenter, a professional man for the first time in his career. Dr. Carpenter heads a clinic in a ghetto area of a major metropolitan area. He is suprised to be offered assitance by three woman. Unknown to him, the three are nuns in street clothing who are on a ""secret"" mission to aid the community but are afraid the local residents might be reluctant to seek hekp if their true identities were known. Dr. Carpenter falls in love with Sister Michelle Gallagher (Mary Tyler Moore) but her true vocation remains unknown to him. Sister Michelle also has feelings for Dr. Carpenter but is reluctant to leave the order. The film concludes with Sister Michelle entering a church to pray for guidance to make her choice - the church or Dr. Carpenter.Unfortunately, by this time, Elvis had lost his lack of interest in pursuing a film career and had let his film contracts expire. He was eagerly awaiting his freedom to return to live performances.It's interesting to note the cast in this film. Mary Tyler Moore who had success in the Dick Van Dyke show and her own series The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Ed Asner who co-stared on The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Jane Elliot (Sister Barbara Bennett) is now a well know soap opera star.

Can you really see Elvis Presley taking a medical exam? Better casting would be Fabian Forte as a nuclear scientist, or Frankie Avalon as a U.N. diplomat, or Sandra Dee solving the world hunger problem. (Then again, Frank Sinatra once played a Catholic priest.) Three happening nuns--Mary Tyler Moore, Jane Elliot and Barbara McNair--venture out into the Real World and it doesn't take long before horny Puerta Rican men with drinking problems try to feel them up. If that weren't bad enough, cranky old Causcasian women looking out of windows make snaps like: ""She's black as the ace of spades!"" It's 1969 and America has REAL PROBLEMS--and our ladies with their exquisite bone structures are ready to get down and funky with the street. They volunteer at a free clinic presided over by King Elvis, slimmed down and in the middle of his 1968-1970 prime. Still high from his '68 Comeback Special and a few months away from his Vegas revival, Big E is obviously just getting this contractual obligation out of the way. He fidgets around in every scene, like he can't wait for the director to yell ""Cut-Print"" so he can horse around with his Memphis Mafia. It's the usual Presley screen persona, surly, unpleasant, condescending, peeved at every little thing. (Hardly acting, Elvis hated these movies.) Elvis would tell MTM that she was the first of his leading ladies he never shacked up with. (One thing's for certain, though, their hair dye came out of the same bottle.) There's some ludicrous symbolism involved in this turkey. Elvis plays John Carpenter. Get it? JC? John Carpenter? Jesus Christ? Jesus was a carpenter? Jesus was the King? So was the Man from Memphis? Cough-cough. Dr. Elvis comes on to Sister Mary Tyler Moore and in the last scene of the movie her gaze goes from Elvis to Jesus to Elvis to Jesus and we're forever left wondering which one she chooses. (Considering how E became a fat druggie, let's hope she made the right decision.)

My &quot;mama always used to say that&quot; Elvis was a better actor than most people believed, but from watching films like BLUE HAWAII, I thought she was just couldn't face the truth that Elvis couldn't act his way out of a paper bag.  After seeing CHANGE OF HABIT (and learning more about how Colonel Parker ran the King's life) I realized my Mom was right, Elvis was a decent actor. It's just that he was never allowed many opportunities to display his talent and grow as an actor.  This is unfortunate.CHANGE OF HABIT is a good movie. It has an interesting plot, most of the characters aren't just paper mache blowing in the wind, and the movie deals with social issues that are still relevant even today.  Many people suggest that Mary Tyler Moore is miscast in this film, but I found her believable in her role as a nun. Also, the supporting cast does a good job given their limited screen time.As is the case in all Elvis' movies, there are tunes. However, unlike the other Elvis' films I have seen, the movie isn't structured around the songs. The songs that you actually see Elvis singing appear more natural than staged and a couple of them are really memorable, e.g. &quot;In the Ghetto&quot;.I haven't seen very many Elvis' films, but out of the ones I have viewed, this is the best.  I wish Elvis would have been allowed to make more films like this. He could have ended up being remembered as much for his acting as his singing and that would have really been a change of habit.",4,"&quot;A good movie, not just an Elvis movie.&quot;",983318400,"02 28, 2001",2001,1700,"['When', 'was', 'younger', 'anytime', 'parents', 'other', 'adults', 'talked', 'Elvis', 'movies', 'what', 'came', 'mind', 'were', 'lame', 'movies', 'very', 'little', 'plot', 'structured', 'way', 'Elvis', 'could', 'sing', 'quot', 'new', 'quot', 'tunes', 'My', 'quot', 'always', 'used', 'say', 'quot', 'Elvis', 'was', 'better', 'actor', 'most', 'people', 'believed', 'watching', 'films', 'BLUE', 'HAWAII', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'face', 'truth', 'Elvis', 'could', ""n't"", 'act', 'way', 'paper', 'bag', 'seeing', 'CHANGE', 'OF', 'HABIT', 'learning', 'more', 'how', 'Colonel', 'Parker', 'ran', 'King', 'life', 'realized', 'Mom', 'was', 'right', 'Elvis', 'was', 'decent', 'actor', 'just', 'was', 'never', 'allowed', 'many', 'opportunities', 'display', 'talent', 'grow', 'actor', 'unfortunate.CHANGE', 'OF', 'HABIT', 'good', 'movie', 'interesting', 'plot', 'most', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'paper', 'mache', 'blowing', 'wind', 'movie', 'deals', 'social', 'issues', 'are', 'still', 'relevant', 'even', 'today', 'Many', 'people', 'suggest', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'miscast', 'film', 'found', 'believable', 'role', 'nun', 'Also', 'supporting', 'cast', 'good', 'job', 'given', 'limited', 'screen', 'time.As', 'case', 'Elvis', 'movies', 'are', 'tunes', 'However', 'other', 'Elvis', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', ""n't"", 'structured', 'songs', 'songs', 'actually', 'see', 'Elvis', 'singing', 'appear', 'more', 'natural', 'staged', 'couple', 'are', 'really', 'memorable', 'e.g', 'quot', 'Ghetto', 'quot', '.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'very', 'many', 'Elvis', 'films', 'ones', 'have', 'viewed', 'best', 'wish', 'Elvis', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'allowed', 'make', 'more', 'films', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'remembered', 'much', 'acting', 'singing', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'change', 'habit']",Change of Habit VHS

It's offensive in its stereotypes (Elvis utters, ""The last 3 nurses that worked here couldn't take it.  Two of them got raped.  One even against her will."")  Perhaps, at the time, it was meant to be funny, but time has revealed every flaw of this movie and made it utterly irrelevant.  It's very obviously shot on a backlot and not in NY which, at the time, would have added a gritty realism to this saggingly artificial film.In many ways it reminded me of ""Sister Act"" except that ""Sister Act"" was a comedy and everyone was ""in on the joke"".  This movie would have us believing that autism can be cured by hugs in one office visit.  Mary Tyler Moore is her usual self...playing a bit uptight but well-intentioned.  Elvis, if it weren't WIDELY known before this movie, is no actor.  He delivers the lines in this film as casually and ""throw-away"" as he would deliver a line about a coconut in Hawaii.  A talented man.
