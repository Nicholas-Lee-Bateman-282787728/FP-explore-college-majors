Not a lot of zombies, only a few. Only a few roles or actors actresses on this story. My only complaint was there were two male key roles in this show, and there was too much time spent on camera with the two of them close to one another, staring at each other's face, and the cameras were too close to their faces. Other than that it was a great film. It was not a life style film at all, in fact, the two male characters each had their own girl friends, it was just a surprise, possible error by the directors or producers. Good quality story, plot, acting. However when I saw it on Amazon download, in the middle of the film, it kept stalling, frezzing, it took me a whole extra hour just to see this film, I almost contacted Amazon for a refund. That was not fault of creators of this film.

1602254,A2Y67ZQE0V2AE3,B009TR7A08,bd2999,"[0, 2]","I typically watch these lower budget zombie flicks and find them to generally be horrible. This is one of the few ""gems"". The acting is passable and actually pretty decent at other times (in other words some actors are better than others) and the camera work looks professional. State of Emergency does a pretty good job with atmosphere maintaining the isolated cut-off feeling of some of the better zombie films. The story is fairly engaging. Some might find it dull at times, as there are not zombies running around every five seconds but they are used effectively and the heroes never become super zombie smashing characters, keeping them somewhat realistic.I do wish they used more practical FX and less CGI. And the zombies are runners and scream like jungle cats. So it is like the Dawn of the Dead remake or 28 Days later sort of thing. So if you hate those sorts of zombies be prepared. IT really is a good movie and worth checking out. Ignore some of the more negative reviews. I will not spoil the plot to much, but one of the reviewers is outright wrong. The lead does not fall in love with a new woman after 6 days. They become friends but that is really as far as it goes. Maybe a hint that she is interested in him, but really she is not used to others caring about her in the least, so it is really just friends through the movie. The relationships between the characters are fine but really the two male leads steal the show, the females do not have that much involvement at times, at least Julie. Anyway, good movie so check it out.",4,Surprisingly good...,1366934400,"04 26, 2013",2013,1549,"['typically', 'watch', 'lower', 'budget', 'zombie', 'flicks', 'find', 'generally', 'be', 'horrible', 'one', 'few', 'gems', 'acting', 'passable', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent', 'other', 'times', 'other', 'words', 'actors', 'are', 'better', 'others', 'camera', 'work', 'professional', 'State', 'Emergency', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'atmosphere', 'maintaining', 'isolated', 'cut-off', 'feeling', 'better', 'zombie', 'films', 'story', 'fairly', 'engaging', 'might', 'find', 'dull', 'times', 'are', 'not', 'zombies', 'running', 'around', 'five', 'seconds', 'are', 'used', 'effectively', 'heroes', 'never', 'become', 'super', 'zombie', 'smashing', 'characters', 'keeping', 'somewhat', 'do', 'wish', 'used', 'more', 'practical', 'FX', 'less', 'CGI', 'zombies', 'are', 'runners', 'scream', 'jungle', 'cats', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'remake', '28', 'Days', 'later', 'sort', 'thing', 'So', 'hate', 'sorts', 'zombies', 'be', 'prepared', 'IT', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'Ignore', 'more', 'negative', 'reviews', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'plot', 'much', 'one', 'reviewers', 'outright', 'wrong', 'lead', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'new', 'woman', '6', 'days', 'become', 'friends', 'really', 'as', 'far', 'Maybe', 'hint', 'interested', 'really', 'not', 'used', 'others', 'caring', 'least', 'really', 'just', 'friends', 'movie', 'relationships', 'characters', 'are', 'fine', 'really', 'two', 'male', 'leads', 'steal', 'show', 'females', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'that', 'much', 'involvement', 'times', 'least', 'Julie', 'Anyway', 'good', 'movie', 'so', 'check', 'out']",State of Emergency
1602255,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B009TR7A08,blackaciddevil,"[1, 1]","After an explosion unleashes the contents of a military bio-weapons plant, the population of a county is transformed into an army of flesh-eaters. Trapped in the quarantine zone, Jim finds himself cut off from everyone else and fighting for his own survival. Contacted by a small group of survivors unaffected by the toxins, Jim sets out to reach them. Taking charge and becoming their leader, he struggles to keep order as they hunker down, fortify their stronghold and arm themselves against the flesh-eaters. Radio reports from outside the county hint that a last-ditch government rescue plan is being put together. But can he & the survivors hold out until help arrives?What amazes me about the film is the fact that, with the cover to the DVD like it is, you'd expect this movie to be something akin to Zombieland or Shaun of the Dead...when, in fact, it is anything but that kind of film. It was on that fact, alone, that I almost didn't buy the film as I figured it as something of the former or, at the very least, an even lower-budget zombie movie that would be a decent time-waster while throwing back a few brews. So, I take a quick look online on my phone and see what everyone else had to say about the movie. Considering it was mostly favorable things about the film, I decide to buy it. Getting it home, I pop it in my DVD player and press play...and came away amazed. State of Emergency rocked! It, too, reminded me of another chapter of The Crazies. Shot on Red One cameras, the film looks astounding. These cameras are blurring the lines between low-budget and high budget efforts. I'm seeing more and more films being made with them(Death Race 3:Inferno, for example). I see a time, in the near future, when these cameras will be the standard issue camera to use to make your low-budgeter look big-budget. Production was good, acting was good. No complaints...except for two things. First and foremost, State of Emergency got off to a pretty slow start. Then, once it got to rolling good, it was over. Second, which is my biggest complaint, is the ending. &lt;Spoiler Alert(?)> Jim actually reunites with his friends at the end and all is good? No surprise at the end? No hint to a sequel? Just hugs and smiles. &lt;Yawn> Come on! I set through a 90 minute movie for that? Please!At any rate, State of Emergency delivered on all other counts and that's all that mattered to me. It's a zombie film that rise above the others by making things more personal. You can tell Director Turner Clay put some thought into this zombie film.The zombie genre might be a sea that's been well-swam in but State of Emergency stands out amongst them all. I do hope this is one zombie film that sees a sequel happen.",4,State of Emergency.....,1367971200,"05 8, 2013",2013,2717,"['explosion', 'contents', 'military', 'bio-weapons', 'plant', 'population', 'county', 'transformed', 'army', 'flesh-eaters', 'Trapped', 'quarantine', 'zone', 'Jim', 'cut', 'off', 'everyone', 'else', 'fighting', 'own', 'survival', 'Contacted', 'small', 'group', 'survivors', 'unaffected', 'toxins', 'Jim', 'out', 'reach', 'Taking', 'charge', 'becoming', 'leader', 'keep', 'order', 'hunker', 'down', 'fortify', 'stronghold', 'arm', 'flesh-eaters', 'Radio', 'reports', 'county', 'hint', 'last-ditch', 'government', 'rescue', 'plan', 'being', 'put', 'together', 'can', 'survivors', 'hold', 'out', 'help', 'arrives', 'What', 'film', 'fact', 'cover', 'DVD', ""'d"", 'expect', 'movie', 'be', 'something', 'akin', 'Zombieland', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'when', 'fact', 'anything', 'kind', 'film', 'was', 'fact', 'alone', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'film', 'figured', 'something', 'former', 'very', 'least', 'even', 'lower-budget', 'zombie', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'decent', 'time-waster', 'throwing', 'back', 'few', 'brews', 'So', 'take', 'quick', 'look', 'online', 'phone', 'see', 'what', 'everyone', 'else', 'had', 'say', 'movie', 'Considering', 'was', 'mostly', 'favorable', 'things', 'film', 'decide', 'buy', 'Getting', 'home', 'pop', 'DVD', 'player', 'press', 'play', 'came', 'away', 'amazed', 'State', 'Emergency', 'rocked', 'too', 'reminded', 'chapter', 'Crazies', 'Shot', 'Red', 'One', 'cameras', 'film', 'astounding', 'cameras', 'are', 'blurring', 'lines', 'low-budget', 'high', 'budget', 'efforts', ""'m"", 'seeing', 'more', 'more', 'films', 'being', 'made', 'Death', 'Race', '3', 'Inferno', 'example', 'see', 'time', 'near', 'future', 'when', 'cameras', 'will', 'be', 'standard', 'issue', 'camera', 'use', 'make', 'low-budgeter', 'look', 'big-budget', 'Production', 'was', 'good', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'complaints', 'two', 'things', 'First', 'foremost', 'State', 'Emergency', 'got', 'off', 'pretty', 'slow', 'start', 'Then', 'got', 'rolling', 'good', 'was', 'over', 'Second', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'ending', 'lt', 'Spoiler', 'Alert', '>', 'Jim', 'actually', 'friends', 'end', 'good', 'surprise', 'end', 'hint', 'sequel', 'Just', 'hugs', 'smiles', 'lt', 'Yawn', '>', 'Come', 'set', '90', 'minute', 'movie', 'Please', 'rate', 'State', 'Emergency', 'delivered', 'other', 'counts', 'mattered', 'zombie', 'film', 'rise', 'others', 'making', 'things', 'more', 'personal', 'can', 'tell', 'Director', 'Turner', 'Clay', 'put', 'thought', 'zombie', 'zombie', 'genre', 'might', 'be', 'sea', 'been', 'well-swam', 'State', 'Emergency', 'out', 'do', 'hope', 'one', 'zombie', 'film', 'sequel', 'happen']",State of Emergency

But it was not the full-bore Zombie flick I was hoping it would be judging by the deceptive DVD cover art.  Nor was it even remotely like the synopsis printed on the back cover.  There was no ""roaming army of flesh-eating zombies.""  As for ""the small band of others,"" that our lone, so-called hero Jim (Jay Hayden) joins up with, just 3 people in an enormous factory.  They do not ""fortify their stronghold"" against the occasional zombie, they just sit there and yap and bond with one another.  Calling this isolated incident an ""undead apocalypse"" is stretching things mightily.  This is zombie-lite.  This is amateur theatrics in the same vein as a bunch of kids getting together to put on a show.  Sadly, somewhere along the line they forget to invite the zombies.Yes, it is very stylish looking.  But the acting was marginal and the dialog hopelessly prosaic.  The FX was sparingly used to some effect.  Instead, they relied heavily on the overuse of sound, trying to make every footstep operatic in scope.  This is definitely the noisiest suspense thriller I've ever watched.  Unfortunately, the pacing was off, there were far too many scenes that involved long static pauses.  And with dialog like ""I've got a gun and I'm not afraid to use it!""

1602266,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B009TR7A08,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[3, 3]","In a day and age where zombie movies are a dime a dozen, filmmakers have to do something in order to stand out from the crowd. It's not enough to just show the walking dead running or lumbering toward victims and then eating them. There's only so many times you can be shocked by a flesh-eater getting plugged in the head with a rifle. George Romero, Danny Broiled, and countless other directors have already given us those moments hundreds of times over. Unfortunately, ""State of Emergency"" is another in a long line of films that brings nothing new to the table at all.A chemical plant explodes outside a small town. The residents soon show signs of contamination and become ravenous animals with an appetite for flesh. The government closes off the town, leaving any survivors in the area to fend for themselves. Four people holed up in a warehouse must find a way to stay alive and keep the rabid mutants at bay as they await rescue by the military.There's really not much to say about ""State of Emergency."" It's a fast-moving zombie movie where they have bloodshot eyes, growl, and attack people ferociously. The whole film is forgettable and gives us little to nothing to get excited about. You get mentally and emotionally numb after seeing dozens of these with the same basic set-ups.Another of my complaints is that we get one zombie at a time in ""State of Emergency."" There's never a ferocious pack of them attacking anyone. One at a time they come out the grassy fields and attack one of the four survivors. It was as if the filmmakers were trying to save money on make-up by only showing one mutant at a time. Granted, the make-up looked good. It should have. There was only one person to apply it to at a time.Now that I've completely trashed the film, let me give some positive feedback. There are a few moments of genuine suspense when you're waiting for something to jump out from behind or beside a character. The scenes of various mutants standing alone in the distance are also strangely disturbing.Special features included deleted scenes and two featurettes. One highlights the visual effects and the other is entitled ""The Making of 'State of Emergency.'"" It's very short and consists of several clips of different scenes being shot.""State of Emergency"" is the type of movie you watch when you've ran out of all other options. If you're a zombie fan, it will temporarily satisfy you're hunger on a boring Saturday night. However, chances are you're not going to remember it in a week. You're definitely not going to remember it after seeing just the trailer for ""World War Z.""",3,"DVD Review: ""State of Emergency""",1367625600,"05 4, 2013",2013,2598,"['day', 'age', 'where', 'zombie', 'movies', 'are', 'dime', 'dozen', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'do', 'something', 'order', 'stand', 'out', 'crowd', 'not', 'enough', 'just', 'show', 'walking', 'dead', 'running', 'lumbering', 'victims', 'then', 'eating', 'only', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'shocked', 'flesh-eater', 'getting', 'plugged', 'head', 'rifle', 'George', 'Romero', 'Danny', 'Broiled', 'countless', 'other', 'directors', 'have', 'already', 'given', 'moments', 'hundreds', 'times', 'Unfortunately', 'State', 'Emergency', 'long', 'line', 'films', 'nothing', 'new', 'table', 'all.A', 'chemical', 'plant', 'small', 'town', 'residents', 'soon', 'show', 'signs', 'contamination', 'become', 'ravenous', 'animals', 'appetite', 'flesh', 'government', 'town', 'leaving', 'survivors', 'area', 'fend', 'Four', 'people', 'holed', 'up', 'warehouse', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'stay', 'alive', 'keep', 'rabid', 'mutants', 'bay', 'await', 'rescue', 'military.There', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'say', 'State', 'Emergency', 'fast-moving', 'zombie', 'movie', 'where', 'have', 'bloodshot', 'eyes', 'growl', 'attack', 'people', 'ferociously', 'whole', 'film', 'forgettable', 'little', 'nothing', 'get', 'excited', 'get', 'mentally', 'emotionally', 'numb', 'seeing', 'dozens', 'same', 'basic', 'set-ups.Another', 'complaints', 'get', 'one', 'zombie', 'time', 'State', 'Emergency', 'never', 'ferocious', 'pack', 'attacking', 'anyone', 'One', 'time', 'come', 'out', 'grassy', 'fields', 'attack', 'one', 'four', 'survivors', 'was', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'trying', 'save', 'money', 'make-up', 'only', 'showing', 'one', 'mutant', 'time', 'Granted', 'make-up', 'looked', 'good', 'should', 'have', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'apply', 'time.Now', ""'ve"", 'completely', 'trashed', 'film', 'let', 'give', 'positive', 'feedback', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'genuine', 'suspense', 'when', ""'re"", 'waiting', 'something', 'jump', 'out', 'beside', 'character', 'scenes', 'various', 'mutants', 'standing', 'alone', 'distance', 'are', 'also', 'strangely', 'disturbing.Special', 'features', 'included', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'two', 'featurettes', 'One', 'visual', 'effects', 'other', 'entitled', 'Making', ""'State"", 'Emergency', 'very', 'short', 'several', 'clips', 'different', 'scenes', 'being', 'shot', 'State', 'Emergency', 'type', 'movie', 'watch', 'when', ""'ve"", 'ran', 'other', 'options', ""'re"", 'zombie', 'fan', 'will', 'temporarily', 'satisfy', ""'re"", 'hunger', 'boring', 'Saturday', 'night', 'However', 'chances', 'are', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'remember', 'week', ""'re"", 'definitely', 'not', 'going', 'remember', 'seeing', 'just', 'trailer', 'World', 'War', 'Z']",State of Emergency

This one looked great based on the DVD cover, which of course usually means a bad movie. So when I got back home I called up my brother [an even bigger zombie fan] and told him to come on over with the drinks. Once he arrived we started this flick up and&#8230;..The story follows a young man trying to survive in a small town that had a factory explode. In doing so the contents of said building turned everyone in the area into zombies. Stuck in the quarantined zone he must survive on his own or try to find other survives that are not infected. It just so happens that those people find him. The only problem is he has to make his way to them once they make themselves known.This is a slow moving film that builds to its end showcasing its human characters more so than the zombies on the outside. I actually really liked that and thought the characters and the actors portraying them were interesting enough. There are some tense moments throughout the film but like I said this is mostly about the people and how they live with one another.Writer/director Turner Clay did a good job here as the film plays out smoothly and that opening scene alone is excellent. I am looking forward to more films from him and will be looking into the one he made before this. This is a cool little flick over all with some behind the scenes stuff on the DVD.

1602277,A2XCFRKYV6GAOJ,B009TR7A08,J.M.,"[5, 6]","This review will contain some spoilers. I'll do my best to keep them to a minimum, but in order to properly review this ""zombie"" movie, there has to been some specifics.First off, I wanted to watch this because I'm a huge fan of zombies and the 4th Season of ""the Walking Dead"" just had its mid-season finale and won't return until Feb 2014, so I thought this movie might hold me over until then. I have to admit, that I'm not really a fan of a fast and athletic zombie variety. I like the more traditional, ""Night of the Living Dead"" or more currently, ""The Walking Dead"" type of zombies. The zombies in this film are more like the zombies from ""28 Days/Weeks Later"". This trend of fast and athletic zombies seems to be the norm these days, so I'll let this one slide, although I REALLY wanted to see the traditional style zombies.Ok, one of the major problems with this movie is that it is one of those movies that shows you the end of the movie at the beginning and then the rest of the movie is about all the events that led up to that moment. Well this really sucks for a zombie flick, because it GREATLY takes away from the drama. Think about it: if you see all of the characters at the beginning/end, and the entire movie is a flash-back leading up to that point, then what does that tell you about the characters? You already know you don't have to worry about any one of them, because no matter how dicey things seem to get, you know that they simply can't die! This was a huge mistake in my opinion.Also, let's talk about the cover of the movie, it is highly deceptive. Based on the cover, you'd expect these to be undead zombies, but they aren't. These zombies seem more like regular humans that have lost their mind, and in fact, in one scene, one of these zombies is shown to be clearly speaking (yes, actually talking and carrying on a bit of a conversation!) to the main protagonist. Also, in another scene a ""zombie"" is shot in the leg and it seemed to clearly respond to the pain. I wouldn't even really call these things zombies in the traditional sense.Another way that the cover is deceptive is that the main protagonist, Jim, is surrounded by a dozen or so undead zombies... well at no point in this movie do any of the character ever encounter more than one zombie at a time.

1602278,AVR1TVB3NKTFO,B009TR7A08,Johnny Goodwin,"[4, 5]","State of Emergency is a perfect example of a budget movie that breaks out of the budget confines and delivers a great movie. What makes it so good to me is the fact that this movie had a damn good writer, one that took time to think out a believable story that flowed and allowed the characters to have some development as well as believable dialogue, instead of constant f-bombs! State of Emergency used great actors that took their role seriously and could act! And lastly, this movie had a crew of high quality film makers that knew and did their job, wither it be special effects, make-up or post production C.G.I. effects. They took their time, gave it their all and it really shows!Now there were a few areas of the story that I had a little trouble with. One was the fact that one of the infected talked while the others just made guttural noises and stood around like they were in a trance. Seems like more could have been brought out about the infected... were they evolving the longer they were infected, or where they becoming more animal like? Another problem I had was the fact that James seemed to bond a little to soon and really tightly with his new found friends, especially the single woman, seeing as how he has just lost his only friend / girlfriend of 2 years who he was fixing to pop the big question to. There was also a few lulls in dialogue at times, dialogue that seems just a little stiff. But over all, the characters seemed to do pretty much what I would expect folks to do in their situation.If you are looking for a gore feast, then State of Emergency is not for you! State of Emergency is not a global ""zombie"" infection or a non stop action packed thriller full of hoards of infected cannibals and non-stop shoot um up bloody gore and guts.  It's mainly about the relationship that develops between a group of survivors. I kept feeling like there should be just a tad more ""something"" to this movie. A lot of the bonding that the survivors share was edited out and put in the deleted footage. I think it would have added a little more character development if we had been able to see more interaction between the survivors; a little more of their day to day life. A little more ""zombie / infected"" interaction would have also added a few more moments of tension and the survivors' fight for survival too.Over all, I give high praise to State of Emergency as well as all involved in the making of it! I enjoyed it for what it was just as much as for what it wasn't. If I were to ever make an infected / zombie movie, I would like to think it would be a little something like State of Emergency!",4,It's nice to see thought and time put into making a zombie film,1366588800,"04 22, 2013",2013,2626,"['State', 'Emergency', 'perfect', 'example', 'budget', 'movie', 'budget', 'confines', 'delivers', 'great', 'movie', 'What', 'so', 'good', 'fact', 'movie', 'had', 'damn', 'good', 'writer', 'one', 'took', 'time', 'think', 'out', 'believable', 'story', 'flowed', 'allowed', 'characters', 'have', 'development', 'as', 'well', 'believable', 'dialogue', 'instead', 'constant', 'f-bombs', 'State', 'Emergency', 'used', 'great', 'actors', 'took', 'role', 'seriously', 'could', 'act', 'lastly', 'movie', 'had', 'crew', 'high', 'quality', 'film', 'makers', 'knew', 'did', 'job', 'wither', 'be', 'special', 'effects', 'make-up', 'post', 'production', 'C.G.I', 'effects', 'took', 'time', 'gave', 'really', 'Now', 'were', 'few', 'areas', 'story', 'had', 'little', 'trouble', 'One', 'was', 'fact', 'one', 'infected', 'talked', 'others', 'just', 'made', 'guttural', 'noises', 'stood', 'were', 'trance', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'brought', 'out', 'infected', 'were', 'evolving', 'longer', 'were', 'infected', 'where', 'becoming', 'more', 'animal', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'fact', 'James', 'seemed', 'bond', 'little', 'soon', 'really', 'tightly', 'new', 'found', 'friends', 'especially', 'single', 'woman', 'seeing', 'how', 'just', 'lost', 'only', 'friend', '/', 'girlfriend', '2', 'years', 'who', 'was', 'fixing', 'pop', 'big', 'question', 'was', 'also', 'few', 'lulls', 'dialogue', 'times', 'dialogue', 'just', 'little', 'stiff', 'characters', 'seemed', 'do', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'folks', 'do', 'situation.If', 'are', 'looking', 'gore', 'feast', 'then', 'State', 'Emergency', 'not', 'State', 'Emergency', 'not', 'global', 'zombie', 'infection', 'non', 'stop', 'action', 'packed', 'full', 'hoards', 'infected', 'cannibals', 'non-stop', 'shoot', 'up', 'bloody', 'gore', 'guts', 'mainly', 'relationship', 'group', 'survivors', 'kept', 'feeling', 'should', 'be', 'just', 'tad', 'more', 'something', 'movie', 'lot', 'bonding', 'survivors', 'share', 'was', 'edited', 'out', 'put', 'deleted', 'footage', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'little', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'see', 'more', 'interaction', 'survivors', 'little', 'more', 'day', 'day', 'life', 'little', 'more', 'zombie', '/', 'infected', 'interaction', 'would', 'have', 'also', 'added', 'few', 'more', 'moments', 'tension', 'survivors', 'fight', 'survival', 'too.Over', 'give', 'high', 'praise', 'State', 'Emergency', 'as', 'well', 'involved', 'making', 'enjoyed', 'what', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'what', 'was', ""n't"", 'were', 'ever', 'make', 'infected', '/', 'zombie', 'movie', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'something', 'State', 'Emergency']",State of Emergency

1602283,AAPT0IT4F8ABH,B009TR7A08,Matthew Scott Baker,"[32, 37]","I have to confess:  when I first saw the DVD cover for this film, I thought it was going to be a comedy.  I'm not sure why, but the expression of the character on the cover gave me the impression that he was in a funny situation.  Thus, my expectations weren't very high when I started watching it.  But wow...I'm glad I did give it a chance; STATE OF EMERGENCY is a top-notch zombie flick that delivers on many levels.I had never heard of STATE OF EMERGENCY before I got the press release, but I would wager that horror fans will definitely be hearing about this one soon.  While it does not really bring anything new to the table, it is a taut, thrilling survival story that will have you squirming in your seat and hiding your eyes.One major aspect of this film that jumped out at me is the way it looks.  I saw in the closing credits that it was shot on a Red One camera, and you can certainly tell; the picture is crystal clear and the quality of the imagery is beautiful.  This clarity lets the audience see every blood-splattered detail of zombie head-shots as they occur.Aside from the look, STATE OF EMERGENCY is shot well and the acting is great.  The production value seems high, which would fit since IMDB.com estimates the budget at $1.3 million.  Even so, that's still not much for a movie, and it appears the production team made excellent use of the money they had.My sole complaint about this film is a very minor one; I don't like the fact that the zombie head-shots were computer generated.  Don't get me wrong...they are very well done, but they are still ""off"" enough to stand out.  The rest of the effects are practical, though, and look fantastic.STATE OF EMERGENCY is a great zombie film, and it will definitely generate buzz in regard to slow-moving-zombies-versus-fast-ones (the creatures in this film run).  I highly recommend giving it a shot.  It not only looks good, but it's haunting and entertaining as well.

1602290,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B009TR7A08,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","State of Emergency (Clay Turner, 2011)The best of the movies I watched this week was, surprisingly, not watched on Tuesday. (A glimpse into the life of Your Favorite Goat: I work from home every Tuesday, so for eight and a half blissful hours, when I am not on the phone with users, I am able to watch movies back to back, and I can usually get through four or five on any given Tuesday.) I was home alone on Wednesday night and on the verge of falling asleep&#8212;I'd been awake all Tuesday night thanks to a medication change that brought on a severe bout of insomnia&#8212;and so I did what I often do, trolled the bottom of my sorted-by-star-rating Netflix queue to find a crappy horror movie to which I could blissfully drift off until the family got home. I chanced on State of Emergency, pulled out the pillow, and prepared to pass out cold. Ten minutes later I was bolt upright, glued to the screen, and I realized that this was one of those wonderful times when the public had gotten it wrong, wrong, wrong, and I was seeing a minor, overlooked gem.To be fair, I went into the movie with expectations even lower than that paragraph conveys; somehow I had gotten the Clay Brothers (Turner wrote and directed, while John Will produced; if you are truly unlucky, you may remember seeing John Will Turner in front of the camera in Hannah Montana: The Movie)  mixed up with the Cole brothers, Derek and Shane, who directed a godawful 2006 no-budget snoozefest called Human Behavior. So I was pretty much expecting &#8220;Human Behavior with zombies.&#8221; Oh, no. No, no, no. State of Emergency wears its horror-loving heart on its sleeve, drawing liberally from 28 Days Later..., The Crazies, Night of the Living Dead, and a handful of other horror films (and, as much as I hate to say it given how much I despised the movie, Cast Away), but they do it well enough, and with enough tender loving care, that I am more than comfortable calling this an homage, not a rip-off.Plot: Jim (The House Bunny's Jay Hayden) is just about to propose to his girlfriend Emilie (Overnight's McKenna Jones) when the world ends. No, really. He doesn't have all that much in the way of details, but thanks to a TV station outside his area he can pick up with rabbit ears (talk about a Crazies throwback!), he discovers there was an explosion at a nearby chemical plant, and the military have quarantined the area. As we open, Jim is carrying Emilie through a field; she has been mortally wounded. We do not know how. (Minor spoiler alert/plothole: we never find out. Doubtful she was attacked by zombies, since we don't see one for a while. Flying shrapnel? He would have known about the explosion before finding a TV. And why didn't he just go home? Note that I cared about none of this while actually watching the movie.) She dies in his arms. Dead weight is heavy, so he finds a horse barn&#8212;seemingly abandoned, but with working water, power, and phone&#8212;and goes about setting himself up a defensible position. (Which leads to the conclusion that, okay, she was attacked by a zombie. But... you know, one more script rewrite would have (a) solved all this and (b) kicked this movie's review up at least a half a star.) Jim finds an industrial barn in which to hole up; it's pretty defensible, but it's also large, which leads to the inevitable &#8220;hey, there's a zombie or two hiding out in here.&#8221; The phones are still working, and a small group of survivors holed up in a warehouse just over the hill gets in touch with Jim; he heads over there, meets them (there's husband and wife Scott [Fading of the Cries' Scott Lilly] and Julie [Kathryn Todd Norman in her first screen appearance], as well as Ix [Desert of Blood's Tori White, whom they found in a state of deep shock and brought back to the compound), and the bunch settle in for a siege with the hope, ubiquitous in zombie movies, that this is a local problem and the government will eventually drop in and rescue them.It would be one hell of a spoiler to tell you one of my favorite things about this movie, since it's the final sequence, but as soon as that sequence started, I was waiting for the other shoe to drop...and eventually it dawned on me that the Bros. Clay were actually going to play that final sequence straight. I don't think I have ever seen that in a zombie movie before. Even if the rest of the movie had been barely competent, that last sequence would push this over the line into recommend territory. However, this is not barely competent; this is well-thought-out, paced like an art-cinema talk piece (which will probably not sit well with some horror fans, but those who have the patience for it will be amply rewarded), acted well enough for government work, and with a surprisingly satisfying resolution. I'm not a huge fan of one of the twists the story takes (there's an obvious romance subplot being set up between Jim and Ix that just doesn't ring true given that Jim's almost-fiancee has just died a few days previous), but that ends up being a minor complaint in an otherwise very pleasant surprise. Well worth the time if you stumble across it. *** ",4,In the Web of a Modern Girl...,1383696000,"11 6, 2013",2013,5153,"['State', 'Emergency', 'Clay', 'Turner', '2011', 'best', 'movies', 'watched',

No news on a release, no news on production, etc. Honestly I had forgotten about the film until recently we were asked about giving away a couple copies in a contact. Score! Not only was it back on but a slew of trailers and a review copy showed up on my doorstep. After a few years of waiting how did the film hold up?Well this one isn&#8217;t your typical zombie film. While the plot isn&#8217;t too original the execution and focus on build up instead of gore and mass zombies was a nice change of pace. Most of the indie undead films that have been out as of late have been too fill of both so it was a nice change of pace.The film opens with Jim (Jay Hayden) watching the madness of an outbreak that is the result of a chemical explosion that is decimating Montgomery County. As he finally decides to get the hell out of dodge he&#8217;s pretty much ignored by the military whose attention he tried to get for help. Unsure of what to do and thinking he will be out on his own he conveniently is contacted by a group whose taken refuge in a nearby warehouse that is full of supplies.There he meets with the group and he and Scott (Scott Lilly) become the two leads with the rest of the cast really feeling either weakly written or just there as the background. I&#8217;m not saying that the acting was bad there just didn&#8217;t feel to be a focus on the rest or that there was any real connection to be made with them. That being said Jim truly is a normal guy you can get behind and root for. Honestly from near the beginning I really wanted him to be able to survive the entire film.So yes you&#8217;ll be expecting to want to see how this group of humans survives the infection, other humans and how they get along with one another. It&#8217;s a good mix of drama, suspense, with a touch of horror mixed in.As the area they are in is secluded you don&#8217;t have to worry too much about the zombies in the film. Let&#8217;s be realistic here we&#8217;re really talking about infected over undead. They are suffering from an infection that makes them very classic zombie feeling though aren&#8217;t going to be coming back from beyond the grave. The lower budget probably showed up the most here as those that were infected looked to have been done in CGI for head shots in a way that didn&#8217;t fit with the quality from the rest of the film. That complaint was in the minority though as the rest of the film though really did look great. Desolate location shoots, minimalistic scenes, I loved the visuals from the rest of the movie.While this would fall into the indie category for zombie movies it&#8217;s one of the more enjoyable ones I&#8217;ve seen in awhile. It&#8217;s a character driven piece so don&#8217;t expect hordes of the undead and gore being up in every scene. It&#8217;s really more of a slow burn but one that fans of the genre who are looking for something with some build up should be able to get behind.",4,one of the more enjoyable ones I&#8217;ve seen in awhile,1392681600,"02 18, 2014",2014,3068,"['had', 'first', 'heard', 'Turner', 'Clay', '8217', '8216', 'State', 'Emergency', '8217', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'then', 'fell', 'off', 'radar', 'news', 'release', 'news', 'production', 'etc', 'Honestly', 'had', 'forgotten', 'film', 'recently', 'were', 'asked', 'giving', 'away', 'couple', 'copies', 'contact', 'Score', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'back', 'slew', 'trailers', 'review', 'copy', 'showed', 'up', 'doorstep', 'few', 'years', 'waiting', 'how', 'did', 'film', 'hold', 'up', 'Well', 'one', 'isn', '8217', 't', 'typical', 'zombie', 'film', 'plot', 'isn', '8217', 't', 'too', 'original', 'execution', 'focus', 'build', 'up', 'instead', 'gore', 'mass', 'zombies', 'was', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'Most', 'indie', 'undead', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'out', 'late', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'fill', 'was', 'nice', 'change', 'pace.The', 'film', 'Jim', 'Jay', 'Hayden', 'watching', 'madness', 'outbreak', 'result', 'chemical', 'explosion', 'decimating', 'Montgomery', 'County', 'finally', 'get', 'hell', 'dodge', '8217', 's', 'pretty', 'much', 'ignored', 'military', 'attention', 'tried', 'get', 'help', 'Unsure', 'what', 'do', 'thinking', 'will', 'be', 'out', 'own', 'conveniently', 'contacted', 'group', 'taken', 'refuge', 'nearby', 'warehouse', 'full', 'supplies.There', 'group', 'Scott', 'Scott', 'Lilly', 'become', 'two', 'leads', 'rest', 'cast', 'really', 'feeling', 'weakly', 'written', 'just', 'there', 'background', '8217', 'not', 'saying', 'acting', 'was', 'bad', 'there', 'just', 'didn', '8217', 'feel', 'be', 'focus', 'rest', 'was', 'real', 'connection', 'be', 'made', 'being', 'said', 'Jim', 'truly', 'normal', 'guy', 'can', 'get', 'root', 'Honestly', 'beginning', 'really', 'wanted', 'be', 'able', 'survive', 'entire', 'film.So', 'yes', '8217', 'be', 'expecting', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'group', 'humans', 'infection', 'other', 'humans', 'how', 'get', 'one', '8217', 's', 'good', 'mix', 'drama', 'suspense', 'touch', 'horror', 'mixed', 'area', 'are', 'secluded', 'don', '8217', 't', 'have', 'worry', 'too', 'much', 'zombies', 'film', 'Let', '8217', 'be', 'realistic', 'here', '8217', 're', 'really', 'talking', 'infected', 'undead', 'are', 'suffering', 'infection', 'very', 'classic', 'zombie', 'feeling', 'aren', '8217', 'going', 'be', 'coming', 'back', 'grave', 'lower', 'budget', 'probably', 'showed', 'up', 'most', 'here', 'were', 'infected', 'looked', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'CGI', 'head', 'shots', 'way', 'didn', '8217', 'fit', 'quality', 'rest', 'film', 'complaint', 'was', 'minority', 'rest', 'film', 'really', 'did', 'look', 'great', 'Desolate', 'location', 'shoots', 'minimalistic', 'scenes', 'loved', 'visuals', 'rest', 'movie.While', 'would', 'fall', 'indie', 'category', 'zombie', 'movies', '8217', 'one', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'ones', '8217', 've', 'seen', 'awhile', '8217', 's', 'character', 'driven', 'piece', 'so', 'don', '8217', 'expect', 'hordes', 'undead', 'gore', 'being', 'up', 'scene', '8217', 'really', 'more', 'slow', 'burn', 'one', 'fans', 'genre', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'build', 'up', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'get']",State of Emergency

1602295,A1N3ICO0066BS6,B009TR7A08,"Utterly Undead Reads (and sometimes more) ""Re...","[0, 0]","Over all, a pretty decent zombie flick. It was worth the watch but not one I would watch again and again.The good:-The infected, and the scenes with them, were very well done. One aspect I really enjoyed was that these zoms are smart. Not just doorknob-turning, I-know-he's-in-the-closet smart, but they're able to problem solve on a much higher level. This touch made it a far more dangerous situation for the survivors than if the zoms had just been mindless chomping machines.-The explanation. The backstory is detailed enough to be plausible, but not a lot of time is wasted on it. I hate zombie movies or stories where no explanation for the outbreak is given, so I was glad to have one here.-The acting/characters. In general, the acting was decent, save for one minor character who was too busy trying to play Holly Hostess during the crisis, though that's the writing, not the actress, I suppose. The characters' actions are mostly believable for the situation, nothing too far-fetched here.The bad:-Not enough zom action. While the parts with the infected were extremely well done, there weren't enough of them. There are also no big hordes of zoms as pictured on the cover and generally expected in this type of movie. The parts that had them were fantastic, there were just less scenes with zoms, and less zoms, than one might expect.-Some things were a bit unrealistic. In one scene, a character takes down zom after zom with long range head shots, hitting his target every time. Without a backstory of some sort of history in shooting, this made his success in this scene highly unlikely as shown.-One character is the stand-offish outsider, initially. We never learn her story or why she's so nasty to everyone- she just is.
