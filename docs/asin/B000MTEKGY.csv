Saint John Bosco was a wonderful surprise!  Firstly, this film is beautifully acted by people who radiate joy and love!  Don't even think about using the English dubbing!  The characters are in their voices and you'll love them right away.  Second, we watched this film over several evenings because we wanted to savour the wonderful story.  We couldn't wait to continue again the next night!  Finally, this was a wonderful example of Christian principles lived out.  We were completely inspired!  This movie is a must for youth groups and families.  Anyone older who has lost their zeal for the faith will get a lot out of it as well!  Enjoy!",5,A moving experience and a new friend...,1190505600,"09 23, 2007",2007,735,"['purchased', 'several', 'Catholic', 'themed', 'films', 'last', 'year', 'were', 'okay', 'were', 'very', 'dull', 'Saint', 'John', 'Bosco', 'was', 'wonderful', 'surprise', 'Firstly', 'film', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'people', 'who', 'radiate', 'joy', 'love', 'Do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'using', 'English', 'dubbing', 'characters', 'are', 'voices', ""'ll"", 'love', 'right', 'away', 'Second', 'watched', 'film', 'several', 'evenings', 'wanted', 'savour', 'wonderful', 'story', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'continue', 'again', 'next', 'night', 'Finally', 'was', 'wonderful', 'example', 'Christian', 'principles', 'lived', 'out', 'were', 'completely', 'inspired', 'movie', 'must', 'youth', 'groups', 'families', 'Anyone', 'older', 'who', 'lost', 'zeal', 'faith', 'will', 'get', 'lot', 'well', 'Enjoy']",Saint John Bosco Mission to Love
1050670,A1I1GC24YNZJO2,B000MTEKGY,A. Ryan,"[39, 40]","St. John Bosco has always had a great appeal to me ever since I was a boy. And this films just captures the man's real, profound love for God, for people, and for life. Especially his true compassion and empathy for outcast youth, tough street kids in Turin, Italy. Bosco had no father himself growing up, and it no doubt helped him have a special understanding of the pain these outcast kids felt as he did everything he possibly could to help them build lives that were happy, productive and closer to God. John Bosco had a lot of opposition from secular society and even within the Church in his efforts to build a facility to house and educate these kids. But he had a very creative mind, a great talent & imagination for inspiring youth, tireless devotion to their needs, and a deep, unshakable trust in the love & mercy of God. Flavio Insinna does a fabulous job in portraying all these unique qualities of St. John Bosco, and this film has a very authentic feel for the period with the sets, locations, costumes. The rest of the acting is uniformly excellent, including performances by Charles Dance and Lina Sastri. The kids in the film also do a fine job, and the overall result is a captivating epic film on the life and mission of one of the most appealing saints in the history of the Church, St. John Bosco.",5,"A Saint with  Great Imagination, Faith & Love",1175558400,"04 3, 2007",2007,1320,"['St.', 'John', 'Bosco', 'always', 'had', 'great', 'appeal', 'ever', 'was', 'boy', 'films', 'just', 'man', 'real', 'profound', 'love', 'God', 'people', 'life', 'Especially', 'true', 'compassion', 'empathy', 'outcast', 'youth', 'tough', 'street', 'kids', 'Turin', 'Italy', 'Bosco', 'had', 'father', 'growing', 'up', 'doubt', 'helped', 'have', 'special', 'understanding', 'pain', 'kids', 'felt', 'did', 'everything', 'possibly', 'could', 'help', 'build', 'lives', 'were', 'happy', 'productive', 'closer', 'God', 'John', 'Bosco', 'had', 'lot', 'opposition', 'secular', 'society', 'even', 'Church', 'efforts', 'build', 'facility', 'house', 'educate', 'kids', 'had', 'very', 'creative', 'mind', 'great', 'talent', 'imagination', 'inspiring', 'youth', 'tireless', 'devotion', 'needs', 'deep', 'unshakable', 'trust', 'love', 'mercy', 'God', 'Flavio', 'Insinna', 'fabulous', 'job', 'portraying', 'unique', 'qualities', 'St.', 'John', 'Bosco', 'film', 'very', 'authentic', 'feel', 'period', 'sets', 'locations', 'costumes', 'rest', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'including', 'performances', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'Lina', 'Sastri', 'kids', 'film', 'also', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'overall', 'result', 'captivating', 'epic', 'film', 'life', 'mission', 'one', 'most', 'appealing', 'saints', 'history', 'Church', 'St.', 'John', 'Bosco']",Saint John Bosco Mission to Love

1050672,A1BATHNY2QAZI2,B000MTEKGY,"Jaime Contreras ""donjaime""","[0, 0]","This Italian-made movie about Father John Bosco (Giovanni Melchiorre Bosco), known as Don Bosco is brought to life by a wonderful performance by Flavio Insinna. Don Bosco was an Italian Roman Catholic priest in 19th century Torino (Turin)who lovingly and unselfishly dedicated his life to the treatment, education and support of street children, juvenile delinquents, and other disadvantaged and abused youth.  The movie sheds light on Bosco's early life, family and struggles with the governmental prefect (Charles Dance) who was envious of him and his social work.  The film also sheds light on the role that Don Bosco had in assisting Countess Maria Domenica Mazzarello in founding the Institute of the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians, a religious order of nuns dedicated aiding and housing poor and homeless girls. In the movie, Don Bosco is confronted with so many roadblocks from the government, the church and rich society that he made his own way to serve and educate society about the plight of these children.  Where no organization or resources existed, Father Bosco founded the Association of Salesian Cooperators, with laity to serve the poor, published the Salesian Bulletin that has grown into an international publication, and trained men and women to carry on his work after his death.  I found this movie to be reverent and touching because of the manner in which paid homage to a man without an ego.  Don Bosco employed love where only harsh discipline had been used before. His method was based on Saint Francis De sales teachings became known as the Salesian Preventive System.  This is a warm and beautifully-acted film of piety, humility and service.",4,Educating and saving the youth,1374192000,"07 19, 2013",2013,1678,"['Italian-made', 'movie', 'Father', 'John', 'Bosco', 'Giovanni', 'Melchiorre', 'Bosco', 'known', 'Don', 'Bosco', 'brought', 'life', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Flavio', 'Insinna', 'Don', 'Bosco', 'was', 'Italian', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'priest', '19th', 'century', 'Torino', 'Turin', 'who', 'lovingly', 'unselfishly', 'dedicated', 'life', 'treatment', 'education', 'support', 'street', 'children', 'juvenile', 'delinquents', 'other', 'disadvantaged', 'abused', 'youth', 'movie', 'sheds', 'light', 'Bosco', 'early', 'life', 'family', 'struggles', 'governmental', 'prefect', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'who', 'was', 'envious', 'social', 'work', 'film', 'also', 'light', 'role', 'Don', 'Bosco', 'had', 'assisting', 'Countess', 'Maria', 'Domenica', 'Mazzarello', 'founding', 'Institute', 'Daughters', 'Mary', 'Help', 'Christians', 'religious', 'order', 'nuns', 'dedicated', 'aiding', 'housing', 'poor', 'homeless', 'girls', 'movie', 'Don', 'Bosco', 'confronted', 'so', 'many', 'roadblocks', 'government', 'church', 'rich', 'society', 'made', 'own', 'way', 'serve', 'educate', 'society', 'plight', 'children', 'Where', 'organization', 'resources', 'existed', 'Father', 'Bosco', 'founded', 'Association', 'Salesian', 'Cooperators', 'laity', 'serve', 'poor', 'published', 'Salesian', 'Bulletin', 'grown', 'international', 'publication', 'trained', 'men', 'women', 'carry', 'work', 'death', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'reverent', 'touching', 'manner', 'paid', 'homage', 'man', 'ego', 'Don', 'Bosco', 'employed', 'love', 'where', 'only', 'harsh', 'discipline', 'had', 'been', 'used', 'method', 'was', 'based', 'Saint', 'Francis', 'De', 'sales', 'teachings', 'became', 'known', 'Salesian', 'Preventive', 'System', 'warm', 'beautifully-acted', 'film', 'piety', 'humility', 'service']",Saint John Bosco Mission to Love

And, for just these reasons, this is the movie that you should see!You have a young man growing up in Italy in 1800s.  He does farm labor, does not have a lot of money, but seems to have a talent for school and all things intellectual.  He decides to study for the preisthood.  Once he becomes a preist, he has a rare selflessness about him.  His sole interest, is helping the poor boys of the street, which were quite plentiful during this time period in Italy.  He forgives those who are viewed as criminals by society and is the sole voice of those who nobody cares about.  He puts his own reputation and position on the line time and time again, he teaches the Christian faith and the gift of literacy to the impoverished children who were often seen as outcasts and criminals.  It was very hard for him to secure any support or resources to help these children, and he faced obstacle and obstacle.  These obstacles even included the hierarchy of the Catholic Church at times.  But he never gave up.This movie can be quite striking.  Its rare that we pay any attention to this kind of man anymore.  In modern society, we have become so pampered that it is strange to see the tale of someone who is willing to do anything to help those around him.  John Bosco is the kind of role model that our society needs, but rarely comes across.  Those who made this movie should be thanked for telling this tale and giving the world a well-made film about such an inspiring man!",5,A Rarity:  A positive movie that is not boring,1276128000,"06 10, 2010",2010,1587,"['kind', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'rarely', 'make', 'kind', 'story', 'rarely', 'hear', 'days', 'just', 'reasons', 'movie', 'should', 'see', 'have', 'young', 'man', 'growing', 'up', 'Italy', '1800s', 'farm', 'labor', 'not', 'have', 'lot', 'money', 'have', 'talent', 'school', 'things', 'intellectual', 'study', 'preisthood', 'Once', 'preist', 'rare', 'selflessness', 'sole', 'interest', 'helping', 'poor', 'boys', 'street', 'were', 'quite', 'plentiful', 'time', 'period', 'Italy', 'who', 'are', 'viewed', 'criminals', 'society', 'sole', 'voice', 'who', 'nobody', 'cares', 'own', 'reputation', 'position', 'line', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'Christian', 'faith', 'gift', 'literacy', 'impoverished', 'children', 'who', 'were', 'often', 'seen', 'outcasts', 'criminals', 'was', 'very', 'hard', 'secure', 'support', 'resources', 'help', 'children', 'faced', 'obstacle', 'obstacle', 'obstacles', 'even', 'included', 'hierarchy', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'times', 'never', 'gave', 'up.This', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'striking', 'rare', 'pay', 'attention', 'kind', 'man', 'anymore', 'modern', 'society', 'have', 'become', 'so', 'pampered', 'strange', 'see', 'tale', 'someone', 'who', 'willing', 'do', 'anything', 'help', 'John', 'Bosco', 'kind', 'role', 'model', 'society', 'needs', 'rarely', 'who', 'made', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'thanked', 'telling', 'tale', 'giving', 'world', 'well-made', 'film', 'inspiring', 'man']",Saint John Bosco Mission to Love

I was a bit worried about a St. John Bosco film because he is always tauted as an anti-corporal discipline and more liberal Saint, but my fears were not fulfilled. It is an excellent story of a wonderful priest who had a great love in his heart for teenage boys and girls on the street. It is VERY well done, not cheesy at all, the acting is wonderful, and I would say it's one of my favorite Saint movies at the moment. Is extremely family friendly even though it deals with some tough items. For that reason you will have to explain a few things to your younger children, but I had no issues with my toddlers and 5 year old watching the film. If you are real particular about violence than you may not like it, but it is not gratuitous, it is necessary to the film, and it's not explicit. The light romances between some of the boys and girls are light and are not focused on, and the story of redemption and love in this film is one that will remain with you for a few days.
