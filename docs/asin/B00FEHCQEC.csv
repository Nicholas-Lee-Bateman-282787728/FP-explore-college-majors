Well, it plays like an unlikely blend of ""Fight Club"" and ""The Wizard of Oz,"" but if you like chopsocky, this is for you. The action sequences feature a minimum of wire-Fu, and the fight scenes are shot in such a way that you see all the kicks and blows. There's a minimum of blood, but I didn't mind that, especially given that the last film I saw (the abysmal ""No One Lives"") was awash in it. In addition to being kickass, ""Man"" is also a meditation on old and new Hong Kong,  and traditional versus contemporary values, especially as they apply to the gentle art of Tai Chi--and did I mention that it's kickass?Star Keanu Reeves has been toying with this project since he first met stuntman Tiger Chen on the set of ""The Matrix,"" and the film was five years in development, with a budget of $25 million. Keanu not only stars in but also directs ""Man of Tai Chi,"" and he acquits himself admirably on both counts. He plays a reclusive billionaire (is there any other kind?), who collects Lamborghinis and Bugattis (not to mention a Bentley or two), but who is lacking the one thing in life that would make him happy: a soulless fighter who doesn't object to killing his defeated opponents.Enter the Tiger!Great locations in Beijing, Hong Kong, and Macau.

What I got was a brilliantly choreographed, stylishly filmed, brutally hard-hitting martial arts film with a surprising moral fiber.But to be honest, I went in for the fights. Keanu advertised over 45 minutes of action scenes, and they did NOT disappoint. Choreographed by the *legendary* Yuen Woo-Ping, of Drunken Master, The Matrix, and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon fame, these fights are realistic, violent, gripping, and surprisingly brutal. Each fight has a different tone and style, and the real highlight for me was to view all the different styles - Tai Chi, Wing Chun, karate, boxing, and more - come together into one glorious flurry of fists, knees, elbows, and feet. Tiger Chen (Chen Hu) has got badassery and style, and in his stunning two-on-one fight in a secret fighting ring on a freighter ship, he showed he has all the skills to become the next Jet Li or Donnie Yen. I see this guy going places.The supporting cast includes the *fantastic* Iko Uwais (sadly underused), Karen Mok, who exudes control and determination, and a plethora of famous Hong Kong actors that you in the west wouldn't know, but to those living in China (like me), are the equivalent of an all-star Hollywood cast. They act like all Hong Kong actors act - over the top, almost caricaturing themselves, but hey, they get the job done.Keanu Reeves is over the top in the finest possible way, exuding the kind of villainery that would make a Bond villain jealous. This, if I dare say it, is one of Reeves's best performances. He is a worthy foe, releasing his inner animal brilliantly, into a suave, dangerous, unpredictable baddo. His final fight with Chen should go down in the annals of kung-fu fights as one of the most stunning ever choreographed.The cons of Man of Tai Chi, however, are too glaring and jarring to ignore. They include that phony type of dialogue and acting that is so popular in Hong Kong soap opera, a lack of emotion, a simpleminded screenplay, and some rote acting from some competitors. But let's face it, we're here for the fights, and director Reeves delivers in spades.If you like action films, kung-fu films, martial arts movies, or all round stylish, fast-paced, and badass films, you will most likely love Man of Tai Chi. If you are looking for the next The Raid or Drunken Master, look somewhere else. But DON'T give this a miss. 4.5 elbow jabs! Er, stars.P.S. Did anyone notice the *fantastic* use of music during the fight scenes by Keanu Reeves?

1671197,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00FEHCQEC,C. Sawin,"[2, 2]","""Man of Tai Chi"" begins with two men pummeling each other to his heart's content as the authorities raid a warehouse. One man refuses to ""finish"" the other as another masked man enters and deals with the matter himself. Donaka then confronts disappointment the only way he knows how and puts on the search for a new contestant as the authorities realize they've followed yet another false lead.The Chinese-American martial arts film has this simple story that feels effortless, but is also fairly flawed in its execution. The short and sweet version is that it's the struggle between yin and yang; two opposites attempting to overthrow the other after being brought together by a common thread. Tiger is in this never ending battle between properly releasing his chi and letting power overcome him while Donaka drags Tiger to hell where he taints his soul and it's up to Tiger to choose whether or not to continue going down that path or the one his master has always trained him for. As Master Yang puts it, ""Man of Tai Chi"" is about perfecting the ""harmony of form and spirit"" and finding your true path.The rest of the story is familiar in the sense that it's about an infected individual cleansing himself of the regrettable actions he's recently partaken in. The disappointing factor lies within how quickly and easily Tiger is able to switch gears. There really is no time for atonement for the character. He doesn't really seem to suffer all that much and he's able to conquer his demons seemingly with the flick of a switch or a turn of the page of the script. There's such importance given to clearing your mind and meditating, but as Tiger begins to doubt the purpose of them both he's never seen doing them again yet miraculously becomes the hero of the picture.Keanu Reeves is so purposely stiff and cold that you can't help but enjoy the Donaka Mark character. He seems to have taken lessons from Nicolas Cage's over the top acting methods and even channels ""Ghost Rider"" as he points at his TV and loudly proclaims, ""Innocent!"" He does this reverberating growl at one point that is memorable for all the wrong reasons. Donaka has this undying passion of corrupting innocent individuals that is both fascinating and baffling.The camera work is quite excellent, especially during the action sequences. The camera usually rotates around the two opponents during a fight scene and features intimate perspectives and fairly dynamic angles. The shots representing passing time are extraordinary, too; the ones that chronicle entire days and nights that seem to wander through the city, duck through telephone wires, sidestep buildings, and finally float through windows.

Keanu Reeves, 2013, 102 minutes) is the slick-looking-oil-spill disaster that is Keanu Reeves' directorial debut ... and I see there is a down-voting conspiracy against all critical reviews. Shame! Also shame on Amazon for even allowing the shills to come and vote. This is a lousy, time-wasting film. This ""watch-now-before-it's-in-theaters"" stupidity is a big red flag, but I watch them anyway.Hu ""Tiger"" Chen, a simultaneously sweet-looking and geeky ""Tai Chi"" student, gets himself involved in some weird underground fighting. The Hong Kong police badly want the responsible culprit, a weird billionaire (Reeves), and everyone suspects there is more than underground fighting occurring.In fact there isn't anything new, with Reeves' character hungry to see the winner murder the opponent. That's new? That's profound? Hell, that's not even interesting. When Reeves first spots footage of Tiger, he points at the screen and says, ""Innocent!"" ~ and I almost expelled my tea from laughing so hard. At least Stallone's ROCKY series tried to keep an understandable moral position.This film is exactly what you might imagine: some idiot with THE MATRIX on his simple mind, making his own simple-minded version of it. It's an insult to martial arts films and students.There are several other big problems with this film, starting with the stupid, mind-numbing violence. Don't start telling me Reeves has suddenly turned profound and is sending a message here. It's 'cop-out kung fu', pure and simple. The martial arts are ridiculous: I saw a supposed T'ai Ch'i Ch'uan student rolling around on the floor like a dog, fighting in some caged-MMA-looking crap-fighting.That's what Tiger Chen has to offer, I'd rather watch something Chinese, like one of those bad 1970s cheapie flicks. At least they tried to look like they were really fighting. Among the newer films, I recommend anything from the mid-1990s onward.In Reeves' sad mess, they even made up a martial art, of which Tiger and his old master are the last successors (the grandmaster is played by my old brother Hai Yu, a/k/a Yu Hai, lately seen in the beautifulShaolin (English Subtitled)as the abbot, see my review).They name this fictitious art: ""Ling Kong Tai Chi"" ~ which essentially means ""empty"". A bit like Keanu's head and this entire film. It's always a saving grace when you have a sweet, very gay-looking young hero who studies under a super-cool wise master ~ but that with horrid violence thrown in does not make a good film at all. It isn't even good eye candy.As to the fictitious art, they need only have chosen one of two paths for Tiger: either he's a T'ai Ch'i Ch'uan student or he's a Ling Kong Jing student. Heck, they may as well have made him a tough little Tae Kwon Do green belt.It is all 100% laughable. I wish I could recommend this; I just can't. Sorry, Brother Yu Hai: you always bring class to any movie you do, but this one is unsalvageable. It will be fruitless to list some good new martial arts films here for you, Amazon readers. Just pick anything other than this, and you'll be right as rain.The 2nd star I awarded to this glop is for my brother Yu Hai, but also because I know a lot of Amazon readers ignore 1-star reviews for no good reason.",2,"Sorry, no real 'Man' (except Master Yu Hai) and no 'T'ai C'hi' to be found in this sour pickle of a movie",1380412800,"09 29, 2013",2013,3256,"['MAN', 'OF', 'TAI', 'CHI', 'Dir', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', '2013', '102', 'minutes', 'slick-looking-oil-spill', 'disaster', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'directorial', 'debut', 'see', 'down-voting', 'conspiracy', 'critical', 'reviews', 'Shame', 'Also', 'shame', 'Amazon', 'even', 'allowing', 'shills', 'come', 'vote', 'lousy', 'time-wasting', 'film', ""watch-now-before-it's-in-theaters"", 'stupidity', 'big', 'red', 'flag', 'watch', 'anyway.Hu', 'Tiger', 'Chen', 'simultaneously', 'sweet-looking', 'geeky', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'student', 'involved', 'weird', 'underground', 'fighting', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'police', 'badly', 'want', 'responsible', 'culprit', 'weird', 'billionaire', 'Reeves', 'everyone', 'suspects', 'more', 'underground', 'fighting', 'occurring.In', 'fact', ""n't"", 'anything', 'new', 'Reeves', 'character', 'hungry', 'see', 'winner', 'murder', 'opponent', 'new', 'profound', 'Hell', 'not', 'even', 'interesting', 'When', 'first', 'spots', 'footage', 'Tiger', 'screen', 'Innocent', '~', 'almost', 'expelled', 'tea', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'least', 'Stallone', 'ROCKY', 'series', 'tried', 'keep', 'understandable', 'moral', 'position.This', 'film', 'exactly', 'what', 'might', 'imagine', 'idiot', 'THE', 'MATRIX', 'simple', 'mind', 'making', 'own', 'simple-minded', 'version', 'insult', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'students.There', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'big', 'problems', 'film', 'starting', 'stupid', 'mind-numbing', 'violence', 'Do', ""n't"", 'start', 'telling', 'suddenly', 'turned', 'profound', 'sending', 'message', 'here', ""'cop-out"", 'kung', 'fu', 'pure', 'simple', 'martial', 'arts', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'saw', 'supposed', ""T'ai"", 'Ch', 'i', ""Ch'uan"", 'student', 'rolling', 'around', 'floor', 'dog', 'fighting', 'caged-MMA-looking', 'crap-fighting.That', 'what', 'Tiger', 'Chen', 'offer', ""'d"", 'rather', 'watch', 'something', 'Chinese', 'one', 'bad', '1970s', 'cheapie', 'flicks', 'least', 'tried', 'look', 'were', 'really', 'fighting', 'newer', 'films', 'recommend', 'anything', 'mid-1990s', 'onward.In', 'Reeves', 'sad', 'mess', 'even', 'made', 'up', 'martial', 'art', 'Tiger', 'old', 'master', 'are', 'last', 'successors', 'grandmaster', 'played', 'old', 'brother', 'Hai', 'Yu', 'a/k/a', 'Yu', 'Hai', 'lately', 'seen', 'beautifulShaolin', 'English', 'Subtitled', 'abbot', 'see', 'review', '.They', 'name', 'fictitious', 'art', 'Ling', 'Kong', 'Tai', 'Chi', '~', 'essentially', 'empty', 'bit', 'Keanu', 'head', 'entire', 'film', 'always', 'saving', 'grace', 'when', 'have', 'sweet', 'very', 'gay-looking', 'young', 'hero', 'who', 'studies', 'super-cool', 'wise', 'master', '~', 'horrid', 'violence', 'thrown', 'not', 'make', 'good', 'film', ""n't"", 'even', 'good', 'eye', 'candy.As', 'fictitious', 'art', 'need', 'only', 'have', 'chosen', 'one', 'two', 'paths', 'Tiger', ""T'ai"", 'Ch', 'i', ""Ch'uan"", 'student', 'Ling', 'Kong', 'Jing', 'student', 'Heck', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'made', 'tough', 'little', 'Tae', 'Kwon', 'Do', 'green', 'belt.It', '100', '%', 'laughable', 'wish', 'could', 'recommend', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Sorry', 'Brother', 'Yu', 'Hai', 'always', 'bring', 'class', 'movie', 'do', 'one', 'unsalvageable', 'will', 'be', 'fruitless', 'list', 'good', 'new', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'here', 'Amazon', 'readers', 'Just', 'pick', 'anything', 'other', ""'ll"", 'be', 'right', 'rain.The', '2nd', 'star', 'awarded', 'glop', 'brother', 'Yu', 'Hai', 'also', 'know', 'lot', 'Amazon', 'readers', 'ignore', '1-star', 'reviews', 'good', 'reason']",N/A

1671219,AZ505YQE7561U,B00FEHCQEC,"J. Maines ""Web developer""","[2, 4]","I've seen so many underground fight movies in the past few years.  The most mundane and least spectacular but also my favorite of the bunch was Fight Club.  This is not like that movie.  Man of Tai Chi is fairly straightforward, not really about anything other than inner peace and kung fu fighting.  It has a hint of supernatural elements, as well, but it only really uses those elements toward the end of the plot and uses them in a very laid back fashion that does not take away from the story.As far as martial arts films go, this is nowhere near the best in my opinion, but that is just an opinion.  This movie has a lot to offer martial arts fans.  It shows off a lot of spectacular stunts without going into the ridiculous building climbing or wire work.  Of course, I would not be surprised if wire rigs were used for some of the stunts in this film, because there are a lot of flips and turns, some of which are done in slightly slow motion, and some supernatural energy-based attacks which probably required some way of dragging bodies across the scene.  That said, everything was fairly realistic and down-to-Earth for the bulk of the film.What this movie lacks is emotion.  You never quite feel at one with the main character, because you barely know anything about him.  He seems like a nice guy who was suckered into kung fu training by an old man who claims it will benefit him.  That would be the appropriate assumption, but here's the golden question: Why is he training in Tai Chi?  This question is not answered.  I was a bit disappointed by the oversight in the plot, but I was also a little relieved, because I prefer to leave some questions unanswered so my mind has something to be creative with.  I like to think about what may have happened to set him on the path he takes in the movie.  Chances are his life wasn't very interesting before the events taking place in the film's plot, but you do not know that, and that is a good thing.  This movie leaves some room for imagination.Keanu Reeves plays his part as an evil business man brilliantly.  I never quite felt that he was Neo from The Matrix in this film.  He really shows he has some acting skills in this film, that's for sure!  Fortunately, the other actors and actresses play their roles equally well, and there was really only one scene that bothered me throughout the entire movie.  Since describing the scene in any way may spoil part of the plot, I will avoid talking about it, but I must say that it did not take away from the enjoyment of the film.I bought this movie.  I did not rent it.  I say this to give you some perspective on how committed I was to seeing this movie from the start.  I went into the experience expecting something and get what I expected.  I rated this movie a 4/5 to be fair.  It is not a perfectly crafted film and has a few plot holes that bother me, but it is enjoyable as a fight movie.  You can't really expect much else.  If you're looking for good fight scenes, look no further.  This movie has some great choreography and realism while also offering a bit of classic kung fu movie elements, and it all mixes quite well.",4,"Underground fight movies are nothing new, but this is a very good one.",1380326400,"09 28, 2013",2013,3143,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'underground', 'fight', 'movies', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'most', 'mundane', 'least', 'spectacular', 'also', 'favorite', 'bunch', 'was', 'Fight', 'Club', 'not', 'movie', 'Man', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'not', 'really', 'anything', 'other', 'inner', 'peace', 'kung', 'fu', 'fighting', 'hint', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'really', 'elements', 'end', 'plot', 'very', 'laid', 'back', 'fashion', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'story.As', 'far', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'go', 'nowhere', 'best', 'opinion', 'just', 'opinion', 'movie', 'lot', 'offer', 'martial', 'arts', 'fans', 'off', 'lot', 'spectacular', 'stunts', 'going', 'ridiculous', 'building', 'climbing', 'wire', 'work', 'course', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'wire', 'rigs', 'were', 'used', 'stunts', 'film', 'are', 'lot', 'flips', 'turns', 'are', 'done', 'slightly', 'slow', 'motion', 'supernatural', 'energy-based', 'attacks', 'probably', 'required', 'way', 'dragging', 'bodies', 'scene', 'said', 'everything', 'was', 'fairly', 'realistic', 'down-to-Earth', 'bulk', 'film.What', 'movie', 'emotion', 'never', 'quite', 'feel', 'one', 'main', 'character', 'barely', 'know', 'anything', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'suckered', 'kung', 'fu', 'training', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'benefit', 'would', 'be', 'appropriate', 'assumption', 'here', 'golden', 'question', 'Why', 'training', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'question', 'not', 'answered', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'oversight', 'plot', 'was', 'also', 'little', 'relieved', 'prefer', 'leave', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'so', 'mind', 'something', 'be', 'creative', 'like', 'think', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'happened', 'set', 'path', 'movie', 'Chances', 'are', 'life', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'interesting', 'events', 'taking', 'place', 'film', 'plot', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'room', 'imagination.Keanu', 'Reeves', 'part', 'evil', 'business', 'man', 'brilliantly', 'never', 'quite', 'felt', 'was', 'Neo', 'Matrix', 'film', 'really', 'acting', 'skills', 'film', 'sure', 'Fortunately', 'other', 'actors', 'actresses', 'play', 'roles', 'equally', 'well', 'there', 'was', 'really', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'bothered', 'entire', 'movie', 'describing', 'scene', 'way', 'may', 'spoil', 'part', 'plot', 'will', 'avoid', 'talking', 'must', 'say', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'enjoyment', 'film.I', 'bought', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'rent', 'say', 'give', 'perspective', 'how', 'committed', 'was', 'seeing', 'movie', 'start', 'went', 'experience', 'expecting', 'something', 'get', 'what', 'expected', 'rated', 'movie', '4/5', 'be', 'fair', 'not', 'perfectly', 'crafted', 'film', 'few', 'plot', 'holes', 'bother', 'enjoyable', 'fight', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'expect', 'much', 'else', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', 'fight', 'scenes', 'look', 'further', 'movie', 'great', 'choreography', 'realism', 'also', 'offering', 'bit', 'classic', 'kung', 'fu', 'movie', 'elements', 'mixes', 'quite', 'well']",N/A
1671220,AVWU1O6TH3SXG,B00FEHCQEC,"J. McGinn ""HUNTSMAN""","[0, 0]","Keanu Reeves through his long career from Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure to the upcoming 47 Ronin has developed a love for martial arts especially with his experience in the Matrix films, so no surprise that Reeves has chosen a martial arts film has his directorial debut. Plus the Man of Tai Chi isn't a safe risk for the actor turned director with the film having nothing extravagant in story telling or effects, and it pays off for Reeves as the Man of Tai Chi is a fun enjoyable martial arts film.The Man of Tai Chi opens with Donaka Mark (Played wonderfully by Reeves whom I enjoyed as a playing a villain.) viciously stabbing, and killing his own fighter who refused to finish off his opponent he had defeated, and telling his associate to find another fighter. Enter Tiger Chen Linhu (Tiger Chen) a delivery man who has no direction in life outside of Tai Chi. Tiger's desire to prove himself, and show the world that Tai Chi is more than just meditation and defense which is at odds from his master's teachings as he forbids Tai Chi to be used in violence. Entering a tournament Tiger Chen proves himself, and catches the eye of Mark who offers Chen money, and the chance to prove himself in real fights with no referees or rules. Through the brutal fights Mark turns Chen from a rudderless nave delivery man into an emotionless fighting machine on the verge of becoming a heartless killer, which was Donaka Mark's plan all along as his only desire was turning, and watching an innocent man being turned into a killer.Man of Tai Chi's script written by Michael G. Cooney simplistic basically verging on a B level film in storytelling, and it shows with the side plot of Hong Kong detective Sun Jing Shi's (Karen Mok) quest to capture Mark, but the script is effective in the type of film Reeves is directing. With nothing complex or any real deeper meaning with the story Reeves could have fun with the Man of Tai Chi, and Reeves does playing Donaka Mark with glee, and it was entertaining to see Reeves play a villain with dialog like &#34;&#34;You owe me a life!&#34;. Through the Matrix films Reeves became a good friend to fight chorographer Tiger Chen who has been involved in many films fights from the Kill Bill films to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and I can understand that Reeves wanted to showcase his friend's skill on film, but he charisma or screen presence. Outside of the martial arts scenes Tiger Chen is an emotionless robot, and it is understandable as Man of Tai Chi is his first starring role, but the lack of emotion especially in the scenes that require Tiger Chen to show genuine emotion lack it taking away need depth to the film and character. While I know that Tiger Chen is a skilled martial artist I think another actor should have been cast in the leading role.The star of Man of Tai Chi is obviously the martial arts on display, and Reeves displays he eye for detail and understanding of martial arts films. With martial art films the fighting can get repetitive and stale with one fight scene resembling the one before. This happens to almost all martial art films, director Reeves does a good job keeping the fights riveting and fresh with his eye for detail, and his knowledge of the type of films, and of course the advice of his friend Tiger Chen. Reeves keeps the fights generally fresh changing fight locations as well as different types of fights including an exciting two on one battle on a freighter, and bringing in skilled martial art actors including Iko Uwais who many will recognize from The Raid: Redemption, and whom I think would have fit better in the leading role than Chen.Through his career Reeves has been criticized for bland acting ability and facial expressions as the actor works best in action roles like the Matrix films, and Speed or the Bill and Ted films playing characters who are dimwitted or characters with no emotional complexities or depth, so maybe Reeves can more acclaim as a director, much like Ben Affleck has in transforming an average and criticized acting career into an acclaimed career as a director. Whether Reeves can mimic Affleck or not the Man of Tai Chi is a quality start for actor turned director. While the story is very flawed as well as the acting from Tiger Chen, director Reeves does a very good job acting himself, and directing complex martial art scenes to create a film that celebrates Tai Chi, and is entertaining to boot.",3,You owe me a life!,1389052800,"01 7, 2014",2014,4432,"['Keanu', 'long', 'career', 'Bill', 'Ted', 'Excellent', 'Adventure', 'upcoming', '47', 'Ronin', 'developed', 'love', 'martial', 'arts', 'especially', 'experience', 'Matrix', 'films', 'surprise', 'chosen', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Man', 'Tai', 'Chi', ""n't"", 'safe', 'risk', 'actor', 'turned', 'director', 'film', 'having', 'nothing', 'extravagant', 'story', 'telling', 'effects', 'Reeves', 'Man', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'martial', 'arts', 'film.The', 'Man', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'Donaka', 'Mark', 'Played', 'wonderfully', 'Reeves', 'whom', 'enjoyed', 'playing', 'villain', 'viciously', 'stabbing', 'killing', 'own', 'fighter', 'who', 'refused', 'finish', 'off', 'opponent', 'had', 'defeated', 'telling', 'associate', 'find', 'fighter', 'Enter', 'Tiger', 'Chen', 'Linhu', 'Tiger', 'Chen', 'delivery', 'man', 'who', 'direction', 'life', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'Tiger', 'desire', 'prove', 'show', 'world', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'more', 'just', 'meditation', 'defense', 'odds', 'master', 'teachings', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'be', 'used', 'violence', 'Entering', 'tournament', 'Tiger', 'Chen', 'eye', 'Mark', 'who', 'Chen', 'money', 'chance', 'prove', 'real', 'fights', 'referees', 'rules', 'brutal', 'fights', 'Mark', 'Chen', 'rudderless', 'nave', 'delivery', 'man', 'emotionless', 'fighting', 'machine', 'verge', 'becoming', 'heartless', 'killer', 'was', 'Donaka', 'Mark', 'plan', 'all', 'along', 'only', 'desire', 'was', 'turning', 'watching', 'innocent', 'man', 'being', 'turned', 'killer.Man', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'script', 'written', 'Michael', 'G.', 'Cooney', 'simplistic', 'basically', 'verging', 'B', 'level', 'film', 'storytelling', 'side', 'plot', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'detective', 'Sun', 'Jing', 'Shi', 'Karen', 'Mok', 'quest', 'capture', 'Mark', 'script', 'effective', 'type', 'film', 'Reeves', 'directing', 'nothing', 'complex', 'real', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'story', 'Reeves', 'could', 'have', 'fun', 'Man', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'playing', 'Donaka', 'Mark', 'glee', 'was', 'entertaining', 'see', 'Reeves', 'play', 'villain', 'dialog', '34', '34', 'owe', 'life', '34', 'Matrix', 'films', 'Reeves', 'became', 'good', 'friend', 'fight', 'chorographer', 'Tiger', 'Chen', 'who', 'been', 'involved', 'many', 'films', 'fights', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'can', 'understand', 'Reeves', 'wanted', 'showcase', 'friend', 'skill', 'film', 'screen', 'presence', 'martial', 'arts', 'scenes', 'Tiger', 'Chen', 'emotionless', 'robot', 'understandable', 'Man', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'first', 'starring', 'role', 'lack', 'emotion', 'especially', 'scenes', 'require', 'Tiger', 'Chen', 'show', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'lack', 'taking', 'away', 'need', 'depth', 'film', 'character', 'know', 'Tiger', 'Chen', 'skilled', 'martial', 'artist', 'think', 'actor', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'leading', 'role.The', 'star', 'Man', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'obviously', 'martial', 'arts', 'display', 'Reeves', 'eye', 'detail', 'understanding', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'martial', 'art', 'fighting', 'can', 'get', 'repetitive', 'stale', 'one', 'fight', 'scene', 'resembling', 'one', 'before', 'almost', 'martial', 'art', 'films', 'director', 'Reeves', 'good', 'job', 'keeping', 'fights', 'riveting', 'fresh', 'eye', 'detail', 'knowledge', 'type', 'films', 'course', 'advice', 'friend', 'Tiger', 'Chen', 'fights', 'generally', 'fresh', 'changing', 'fight', 'locations', 'as', 'well', 'different', 'types', 'fights', 'including', 'exciting', 'two', 'one', 'battle', 'freighter', 'bringing', 'skilled', 'martial', 'art', 'actors', 'including', 'Iko', 'Uwais', 'who', 'many', 'will', 'recognize', 'Raid', 'Redemption', 'whom', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'fit', 'better', 'leading', 'role', 'Chen.Through', 'career', 'Reeves', 'been', 'criticized', 'bland', 'acting', 'ability', 'facial', 'expressions', 'actor', 'best', 'action', 'roles', 'Matrix', 'films', 'Speed', 'Bill', 'Ted', 'films', 'playing', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'dimwitted', 'characters', 'emotional', 'complexities', 'depth', 'maybe', 'Reeves', 'can', 'more', 'acclaim', 'director', 'much', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'transforming', 'average', 'criticized', 'acting', 'career', 'acclaimed', 'career', 'director', 'Whether', 'Reeves', 'can', 'mimic', 'Affleck', 'not', 'Man', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'quality', 'start', 'actor', 'turned', 'director', 'story', 'very', 'flawed', 'as', 'well', 'acting', 'Tiger', 'Chen', 'director', 'Reeves', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'acting', 'directing', 'complex', 'martial', 'art', 'scenes', 'create', 'film', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'entertaining', 'boot']",N/A

Starts strong and and ends with the question &#34;What was the point of that?&#34; The main plot is at least consistent, but the incentives and the subplots are so muddled that they make no sense.The Good stuff:The premise: This was actually pretty cool. I was hoping for more, but the idea behind the movie was actually a good one. However, it loses focus about halfway through and the end leaves you with some questions about character's incentives.The martial arts: There are some ridiculous scenes, but it's good when they are doing legitimate martial arts. The pace is fast and the moves are very impressive.In Summary:I liked the trailers for this movie and bought it against my better judgement. I regret the purchase because I will probably never see this movie again. If you are extremely curious about this film, then I would suggest renting it at Redbox. In my opinion it's not worth the money to purchase. However, this does show a promising start for Reeve's career as a Director. The filming is done better than you would expect, and while it seems like the first draft of a production that got rushed to its final stages of editing, it shows that if Reeve's takes Directing seriously he can produce some worthwhile films..

1671230,A3QTB346UKG6TV,B00FEHCQEC,Mantis,"[2, 2]","It seems that for years, fans of kick-flicks (like myself) had to import movies from Hong Kong in order to see good fights and stunt work, especially without that awful shaky-cam rock-video editing.  Since prolific fight choreographer Yuen Woo Ping (serving here as action director) made it possible for non-martial-artist-Hollywood-actors like Keanu Reeves (serving here as director) to look proficient in kung fu (with 1999's ""The Matrix""), China has essentially fallen off the map in the world of exciting movie fights, mostly from insisting that nearly every scene of martial arts since 2000 be done with either ridiculous wires, artsy slow motion, or both (yes, I know there are exceptions).  So a dozen years later the very same American actor who symbolized Chinese movie-fight downfall would come into China to film his own directorial debut and ironically deliver fight scenes that were more competently filmed and traditional than any I'd seen in Chinese cinema in several years.  What the hell?Reeves plays Donaka, a wealthy man in Hong Kong who hosts a closed-circuit reality show involving fighters he selects.  He soon chooses a seemingly docile Tai Chi practitioner named Tiger (Tiger Hu Chen, ""House of Fury"", who's very good) as his next prospect.  Tiger has been studying for a long time and is the last descendent of Master Yang (the always awesome but seldom seen Yu Hai, ""Yellow River Fighter"") and the Ling Kong Temple, which is currently being threatened by developers, which causes Tiger to eventually accept Donaka's offer.  Complicating things further is officer Sun Jingshi (Karen Mok, ""Black Mask""), who's after Donaka, but has been ordered off the case.Thematically, this is the kind of movie that Nicolas Winding Refn (""Drive"") might make if he tackled kung fu and made busier films.  It wasn't until my 2nd viewing that I really noticed the dualistic struggle within Tiger.  In the presence of Master Yang (who is concerned about Tiger's ""chi""), he is calm yet impatient.  While fighting for Donaka, Tiger is ferocious yet compassionate, noticeably more principled than those he's surrounded by.  He has a choice to make.  One method gets results, the other doesn't require them, and it's difficult to see what's better long term from a dualistic (yin & yang) point of view.  Good form, Reeves!Of the dozen-or-so fights, all but one are 1-on-1's, and all but two are pretty decent.  Reeves and his crew used a new type of steadicam that aids in the fluidity of filming from different angles in tight spaces with continuous flow, so there's a unique look to much of the fisticuffs here.  Editing's more of an asset than a liability, too.  That being said, there's still something missing from the fights.  Lacking impact, I suppose.  I enjoyed them well enough, except for the two aforementioned brawls, where the crew completely forgot that they were trying to make good fight scenes and threw in some unnecessary strobe lights and wires.  Oh, well, I can overlook that.  What I can NOT overlook, however, is their handling of the cameo appearance by Iko Uwais (""The Raid""), his first outside of his native Indonesia.  His presence is brief and adds absolutely nothing to the film.  Bad form, Reeves!The DVD from Anchor Bay has a nice widescreen picture with 2.40:1 aspect ratio and a 105 minute run-time.  The only available language track has English, Cantonese, and Mandarin with English subtitles.  Additional subtitles available in English (for the hearing impaired) and Spanish.  I would definitely recommend this movie to either fans of fu-flicks, or to students of martial arts or Eastern philosophy.  While the fights are not great, they're far from bad, and the story is interesting and well done.  With just a bit of tightening up, this might've been a classic.2013",4,the mutuality of opposites,1402617600,"06 13, 2014",2014,3807,"['years', 'fans', 'kick-flicks', 'had', 'import', 'movies', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'order', 'see', 'good', 'fights', 'stunt', 'work', 'especially', 'awful', 'shaky-cam', 'rock-video', 'editing', 'prolific', 'fight', 'choreographer', 'Yuen', 'Woo', 'Ping', 'serving', 'here', 'action', 'director', 'made', 'possible', 'non-martial-artist-Hollywood-actors', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'serving', 'here', 'director', 'look', 'proficient', 'kung', 'fu', '1999', 'Matrix', 'China', 'essentially', 'fallen', 'off', 'map', 'world', 'exciting', 'movie', 'fights', 'mostly', 'insisting', 'nearly', 'scene', 'martial', 'arts', '2000', 'be', 'done', 'ridiculous', 'wires', 'artsy', 'slow', 'motion', 'yes', 'know', 'are', 'exceptions', 'So', 'dozen', 'years', 'later', 'very', 'same', 'American', 'actor', 'who', 'symbolized', 'Chinese', 'movie-fight', 'downfall', 'would', 'come', 'China', 'film', 'own', 'directorial', 'debut', 'ironically', 'deliver', 'fight', 'scenes', 'were', 'more', 'competently', 'filmed', 'traditional', ""'d"", 'seen', 'Chinese', 'cinema', 'several', 'years', 'What', 'hell', 'Reeves', 'Donaka', 'wealthy', 'man', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'who', 'closed-circuit', 'reality', 'show', 'involving', 'fighters', 'soon', 'seemingly', 'docile', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'practitioner', 'named', 'Tiger', 'Tiger', 'Hu', 'Chen', 'House', 'Fury', 'who', 'very', 'good', 'next', 'prospect', 'Tiger', 'been', 'studying', 'long', 'time', 'last', 'descendent', 'Master', 'Yang', 'always', 'awesome', 'seldom', 'seen', 'Yu', 'Hai', 'Yellow', 'River', 'Fighter', 'Ling', 'Kong', 'Temple', 'currently', 'being', 'threatened', 'developers', 'Tiger', 'eventually', 'accept', 'Donaka', 'offer', 'Complicating', 'things', 'further', 'officer', 'Sun', 'Jingshi', 'Karen', 'Mok', 'Black', 'Mask', 'who', 'Donaka', 'been', 'ordered', 'off', 'case.Thematically', 'kind', 'movie', 'Nicolas', 'Winding', 'Refn', 'Drive', 'might', 'make', 'tackled', 'kung', 'fu', 'made', 'busier', 'films', 'was', ""n't"", '2nd', 'viewing', 'really', 'noticed', 'dualistic', 'struggle', 'Tiger', 'presence', 'Master', 'Yang', 'who', 'concerned', 'Tiger', 'chi', 'calm', 'yet', 'impatient', 'fighting', 'Donaka', 'Tiger', 'ferocious', 'yet', 'compassionate', 'noticeably', 'more', 'principled', 'surrounded', 'choice', 'make', 'One', 'method', 'results', 'other', ""n't"", 'require', 'difficult', 'see', 'what', 'better', 'long', 'term', 'dualistic', 'yin', 'yang', 'point', 'view', 'Good', 'form', 'dozen-or-so', 'fights', 'one', 'are', '1-on-1', 'two', 'are', 'pretty', 'decent', 'Reeves', 'crew', 'used', 'new', 'type', 'steadicam', 'fluidity', 'filming', 'different', 'angles', 'tight', 'spaces', 'continuous', 'flow', 'unique', 'look', 'much', 'fisticuffs', 'here', 'Editing', 'more', 'asset', 'liability', 'too', 'being', 'said', 'still', 'something', 'missing', 'fights', 'Lacking', 'impact', 'suppose', 'enjoyed', 'well', 'enough', 'two', 'aforementioned', 'brawls', 'where', 'crew', 'completely', 'forgot', 'were', 'trying', 'make', 'good', 'fight', 'scenes', 'threw', 'unnecessary', 'strobe', 'lights', 'wires', 'Oh', 'well', 'can', 'overlook', 'What', 'can', 'NOT', 'overlook', 'however', 'handling', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Iko', 'Uwais', 'Raid', 'first', 'outside', 'native', 'Indonesia', 'presence', 'brief', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'film', 'Bad', 'form', 'DVD', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'nice', 'widescreen', 'picture', '2.40:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', '105', 'minute', 'run-time', 'only', 'available', 'language', 'track', 'English', 'Cantonese', 'Mandarin', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Additional', 'subtitles', 'available', 'English', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'Spanish', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'movie', 'fans', 'fu-flicks', 'students', 'martial', 'arts', 'Eastern', 'philosophy', 'fights', 'are', 'not', 'great', ""'re"", 'far', 'bad', 'story', 'interesting', 'well', 'done', 'just', 'bit', 'tightening', 'up', 'might', ""'ve"", 'been', 'classic.2013']",N/A

1671237,A20DRRKAN5Z9Q,B00FEHCQEC,Moviedude,"[0, 0]","Keanu Reeves is infamous among movie fans for his dual nature: his mainstream career is built on a foundation of 1-note dudebro heroes, yet he spends almost all his free time, and vast piles of his own cash, on indie efforts that his most vocal detractors never even see. He is, in other words, unafraid to invest himself back in filmmaking. So the news that he was taking his stuntman buddy Tiger Chen, going to China, and making a movie actually didn't seem totally weird.Man of Tai Chi is thankfully less like Reeves' past vehicles and more a synthesis of his indi work and Chinese crime thrillers of the early 2000s. Tiger Chen plays a character named Tiger Chen, a courier by day and Tai Chi practitioner on the weekends. Chen is the sole inheritor of his unique Tai Chi style and plans to represent its power as a martial art in an ongoing televised tournament, to the displeasure of his master who feels that philosophy, not fighting, is the important part of Tai Chi.Chen is courted by the mysterous Donaka Mark, played by Reeves, the wealthy and saturnine president of a powerful private security firm. Mark hires Chen to fight a series of underground martial arts matches for a private audience. At first reluctant, Chen enjoys the money the fights bring, as well as the chance to test his growing martial arts prowess without limits. However, the fights  become more brutal, and Chen becomes violent and distant, alienating his friends and being expelled from his tournament. After Chen's newfound brutality forces his master to repulse him with a painful chi strike during sparring, he walks away from his school and becomes a full-time underground fighter. Predictably things go South, and it all wraps up with Mark and Chen facing off in a battle not just of fists but of ideology.Thematically, the film walks familiar ground but it does so very competently. The cinematography and East-meets-West feel are similar to the Wachowski's Ninja Assassin, but while that was a fantasy movie with a few scattered real elements, MoTC is a realistic movie with a few carefully applied fantastic elements. Reeves makes for a bad guy who is sharklike, heartless, and physically intimidating- the perfect foreign devil antagonist to Chen's boyish easygoing Chinese everyman. Special attention also goes to the location shots which pick out modern China in its gigantic, smoggy, sprawling glory and further the latter-day Hong Kong blockbuster feel. And of course Chen is a professional martial artist and stuntman, so all the fights are top notch.Overall Man of Tai Chi is an amazingly solid first directorial effort supported by a capable cast that will scratch many a cinematic itch, from old-school Hong Kong crime thriller, to classic brawler action, to new-wave martial-arts art cinema. Of the many films emerging from the new era of US/Chinese film collusion, this one easily makes the best of its heritage, producing a movie with a truly international feel and top notch values in all production areas.PROS-Tiger Chen does amazing stuff with just a little fun fluff thrown in-Shot like a BAWS-Old-meets-new directorial feel (kind of like Iron Man 3 really)CONS-Final fight between Reeves and Chen kind of has to stretch to make Reeves seem like a match for Chen-Some plot loops come in and just don't matter",5,Worth your time as a modern martial arts classic,1391990400,"02 10, 2014",2014,3316,"['Keanu', 'Reeves', 'infamous', 'movie', 'fans', 'dual', 'nature', 'mainstream', 'career', 'built', 'foundation', '1-note', 'dudebro', 'heroes', 'yet', 'almost', 'free', 'time', 'vast', 'piles', 'own', 'cash', 'indie', 'efforts', 'most', 'vocal', 'detractors', 'never', 'even', 'see', 'other', 'words', 'unafraid', 'invest', 'back', 'filmmaking', 'news', 'was', 'taking', 'stuntman', 'buddy', 'Tiger', 'Chen', 'going', 'China', 'making', 'movie', 'actually', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'totally', 'weird.Man', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'thankfully', 'less', 'Reeves', 'past', 'vehicles', 'more', 'synthesis', 'indi', 'work', 'Chinese', 'crime', 'thrillers', 'early', '2000s', 'Tiger', 'Chen', 'character', 'named', 'Tiger', 'Chen', 'courier', 'day', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'practitioner', 'weekends', 'Chen', 'sole', 'inheritor', 'unique', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'style', 'plans', 'represent', 'power', 'martial', 'art', 'ongoing', 'televised', 'tournament', 'displeasure', 'master', 'who', 'philosophy', 'not', 'fighting', 'important', 'part', 'Tai', 'Chi.Chen', 'courted', 'mysterous', 'Donaka', 'Mark', 'played', 'Reeves', 'wealthy', 'saturnine', 'president', 'powerful', 'private', 'security', 'firm', 'Mark', 'Chen', 'fight', 'series', 'underground', 'martial', 'arts', 'matches', 'private', 'audience', 'first', 'reluctant', 'Chen', 'money', 'fights', 'bring', 'as', 'well', 'chance', 'test', 'growing', 'martial', 'arts', 'prowess', 'limits', 'However', 'fights', 'become', 'more', 'brutal', 'Chen', 'violent', 'distant', 'alienating', 'friends', 'being', 'expelled', 'tournament', 'Chen', 'newfound', 'brutality', 'master', 'repulse', 'painful', 'chi', 'strike', 'sparring', 'away', 'school', 'full-time', 'underground', 'fighter', 'Predictably', 'things', 'go', 'South', 'up', 'Mark', 'Chen', 'facing', 'off', 'battle', 'not', 'just', 'fists', 'ideology.Thematically', 'film', 'walks', 'familiar', 'ground', 'so', 'very', 'competently', 'cinematography', 'East-meets-West', 'feel', 'are', 'similar', 'Wachowski', 'Ninja', 'Assassin', 'was', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'few', 'scattered', 'real', 'elements', 'MoTC', 'realistic', 'movie', 'few', 'carefully', 'applied', 'fantastic', 'elements', 'Reeves', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'sharklike', 'heartless', 'physically', 'intimidating-', 'perfect', 'foreign', 'devil', 'antagonist', 'Chen', 'boyish', 'easygoing', 'Chinese', 'everyman', 'Special', 'attention', 'also', 'location', 'shots', 'pick', 'out', 'modern', 'China', 'gigantic', 'smoggy', 'sprawling', 'glory', 'further', 'latter-day', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'blockbuster', 'feel', 'course', 'Chen', 'professional', 'martial', 'artist', 'stuntman', 'fights', 'are', 'top', 'notch.Overall', 'Man', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'amazingly', 'solid', 'first', 'directorial', 'effort', 'supported', 'capable', 'cast', 'will', 'scratch', 'many', 'cinematic', 'itch', 'old-school', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'crime', 'thriller', 'classic', 'brawler', 'action', 'new-wave', 'martial-arts', 'art', 'cinema', 'many', 'films', 'emerging', 'new', 'era', 'US/Chinese', 'film', 'collusion', 'one', 'easily', 'best', 'heritage', 'producing', 'movie', 'truly', 'international', 'feel', 'top', 'notch', 'values', 'production', 'areas.PROS-Tiger', 'Chen', 'amazing', 'stuff', 'just', 'little', 'fun', 'fluff', 'thrown', 'in-Shot', 'BAWS-Old-meets-new', 'directorial', 'feel', 'kind', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'really', 'CONS-Final', 'fight', 'Reeves', 'Chen', 'kind', 'stretch', 'make', 'Reeves', 'seem', 'match', 'Chen-Some', 'plot', 'come', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'matter']",N/A

1671260,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,B00FEHCQEC,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[0, 1]","I'm a big Keanu Reeves fan from way back, long before The Matrix movies. Partly because he was so handsome in his youth and is still very attractive as a middle aged man, partly because he chose interesting and different stories when he first started out and even after The Matrix franchise hit big he still chose interesting and sometimes supporting roles in small films, and partly because he can act; his strength has always been under-acting, perfect for film, which captures every nuance. His directorial effort is a decent debut, though I didn't particularly care for the slow motion fight scene at the end or the music throughout. And the villain and his organization needed to be re-evaluated and more effectively presented.Keanu gives us the man of Tai Chi, a young, humble, modest, nice guy (Tiger), a good son who has a great Tai Chi master but is manipulated into fighting for money to help his family/master. He comes to the attention of the evil Keanu Reeves character and is pulled into a faux villainous fight club franchise, all hot air stereotypes with rich, bored people. There are so many truly evil people, governments, etc., that films needn't give us these unbelievable villains, but likely those with power wouldn't really like to be shown as dastardly in movies so films give us cartoon villains that are laughable stereotypes. ugh. The weakness in this story by far are the villains, which Keanu represent: ultra rich and bored, who apparently want more dead people in a world already swimming in death, which makes absolutely no sense at all.Tiger, though, is a decent hero, someone you can root for, and his master tries to help him and eventually Tiger gets it, and wins the ultimate battle.This is a fight movie so there are many fights. I don't care for fights so I pretty much fast forwarded past them. It's just lots of fake movie fighting, with obvious gravity-defying wire work. When this type of fighting first appeared in movies, it was interesting, now it is not. The fights aren't poorly done here, it's just that after you've seen a few of them they all look alike to me.The acting is good. The man playing Tiger is good, the man playing his master is good. Keanu makes a decent villain, though as I said, the villain and his group don't really work for me. How Tiger defeats Keanu, using some sort of magic (Tai Chi) isn't explained well. Perhaps it is understandable to people who practice Tai Chi but as most audience members wouldn't know Tai Chi, writer needed to do more work showing what it is and demonstrating it's advantages over other types of fighting. In other words, as this is a fight movie, then really show the nuts and bolts of fighting: explain the different styles, why people are interested and what it does for them. This film is analogous to a cooking film where there are lots of cooks competing for a prize (their lives) but we don't see them buying the ingredients, prepping or cooking, we just see the finished products, with the judge awarding the prize, but not explaining why. Now in this example, cooks in the audience might be able to follow the action, but non-cooks would be lost. That's what The Man of Tai Chi feels like to me. As someone who knows nothing about different fight styles, and as this film insists on being a fight movie, would've been very nice if the writer and filmmaker had taken the time to explain the core of the movie. Not knowing about fighting, it's like the film is in a language I do not understand.It was nice seeing modern China, even down to the smog and traffic jams. Wish more of the movie had shown how ordinary Chinese people live; wish they'd shown Tiger's apartment, it would've been nice to see what Tiger could afford in modern day China on a courier's salary; also would've been nice to see his parents home, and what they were able to achieve by late middle age. Action does take place on some of those sets (we see the family sitting down for dinner), but the sets are not really shown. Would've loved to see their bathrooms or kitchens, to compare the differences in my country and theirs. would've loved to see Tiger's mom shop for, prepare and cook the evening meal for her family, instead of having them all sit down and eat it. Would've been nice to see a Chinese market, something most world citizens would never expect to visit themselves because of the high cost of travel. Women's work gives basic information as to how a society functions, and had the mother's simple preparation of a meal been shown, the audience would've been provided alot of information about modern Chinese society.Tiger at his day job is believable, with his hop-to-it boss.Stereotypical villain: slick, uber luxurious toys including cars, a jet, a helicopter, no real sense of the villain's life or the lives of the customers paying to see these fights: they are presented superficially as stereotypical rich, bored people. With so much going on in the world, could've presented a much more frightening and relevant group of villains.The police are presented pretty typically with a dedicated officer versus her corrupt supervisor. With over a billion people in a society and no doubt lots of criminal activity, kinda hard to believe an officer would fixate on an underground millionaire fight club. It begs the question why? The story shows that the officer had promised the victim she'd deal with the problem and then he disappears. Why does the officer feel such a strong desire to focus on this fight club? Would've been good had the writer shown a connection between the officer and the man who disappeared. Made him a long time family friend perhaps. Anything that explained her dedication to this particular case. Merely that she promised him to solve the case is not strong enough motivation, especially considering that she is going against her direct supervisor's orders and therefore risking her job, something many people would not do. Why then is she willing to do so?Because the hero is sympathetic, is fighting for a good cause, and has a demonstrable skill set; and because the villain murders with impunity [(though I found it odd and somewhat unbelievable that the Keanu character stabs the first guy to death, which would be very messy: would he, the top guy, risk getting his suit bloody? wouldn't he delegate the stabbing to an underling?)], puts out a hit on an officer, and corrupts another, the story works on a basic level of good versus evil, but pretty creakily, as the villains are so poorly developed.  The lead's acting is solid, and everyone else's acting is solid, so give film 2 and 1/2 stars. Fans of oriental fight films are the audience most likely to enjoy the story I think.P.S. How to fix the problems in this movie.Major problem: villains. Okay, alot more time needed to be spent storywise on the Keanu Reeves character and his fight club. Why in the world would a handsome, forty something, obviously very wealthy man spend his time operating an exclusive fight club? Is the club the source of his wealth? Is he addicted to violence? Is he on drugs? If he's into bringing this type of programming to rich people, what motivates him? Is he the sole owner? What does he get out of it? Does he have family? What do they think? Is he insane? How does he run his business? How does he get more customers? What do the customers get? How much do they pay to view the action? Why would they pay anything to watch this type of programming? Answering these questions would've provided a depth and richness to the story, not to mention providing basic information which would've helped the story make sense, and was sorely missing. Answering these questions would have made this film an entirely different and superior viewing experience than was presented.The filmmakers could've cut half the fight scenes and concentrated on the business side of the fight club, the nuts and bolts, and if the writer explained it logically, at least the villains would not have been stereotypes. Stereotypes just mean the writer failed to give enough believable and relateable information about these particular villains.In my opinion, a story belongs to the villain, but it is sold to the audience through the hero/heroine. The villain's villainy must be a recognizable threat in the audience's reality, and this film meets that criteria by having Keanu arrange a hit on a cop and unnecessarily murdering several fighters, merely because they lost a battle. If the villain's motivation isn't shown/explained, the story makes no sense, no matter how sympathetic the hero. This story should've been approached entirely differently. It could still have been called The Man of Tai Chi, but by properly showing who the villains are and the depths of their evil, Tiger's killing their leader would've been a real achievement instead of the superficial success presented here. Why the villains make the specific choices they do in this particular story must seem logical to the audience. So a certain amount of time must be set aside in the story to show/explain their goals and who is frustrating them and why they are willing to go the extra mile of murder to get what they want. What do these murders mean to them? What do they hope to achieve by murdering their own fighters? Showing bizarre behavior, without explaining it in a comprehensible manner, doesn't help your audience understand your story.The approach to the story needed to be re-evaluated. If the writer had just shown why the villains behaved the way that they do, in a way that made sense to the audience, it would've boosted this story from slightly below average to B+.  Presenting the fight club as a business would've strengthened the story.To illustrate what I mean, look at the film Taken. We have evil slavers kidnapping young women, but the movie focuses on the nuts and bolts of the kidnapping ring as a business: we are shown several ways the kidnappers snatch their victims, and by extension, we can infer that any young, slim, attractive woman in the real world would be at risk if she crossed these monsters's path; we see how the slavers control the slaves, i.e., drugs, chains and violence; we are shown the various levels of their business model: the street walker, the drugged women rented to men at a construction site - the slaves there are an employee perk for the male workers and these ordinary construction employees know the women are strung out, but these modern men do not care enough to report this evil to the authorities; no, instead there is a long line of men waiting their turn to rape with impunity. This shows how strong the demand is. We are shown high end virgin slaves going to the highest bidder. And the police allowing all this to happen, even though the young women and/or their parents are tax payers and pay the police to protect society, and by extension, their daughters. But the police in this story can get more money from the slavers, so they disavow their duty and are corrupted.A story is a proof. In Taken we see supply and demand, and total disrespect/devaluation of women sex slaves and the men who take advantage of them for profit and pleasure. This is the business model and it is proven in Taken. The story demonstrates how the villains capture slaves, how they are able to get away with it (drugging victims, corrupting officers), and why they do it (demand). What is the business model of The Man of Tai Chi? Why are the villains doing what they are doing? How does it benefit them to murder fighters who lose their battles?In The Man of Tai Chi the villains make no sense. Their business, their organization, is not clearly shown, and showing it is the responsibility of the writer and filmmakers. The audience cannot make it up for them.To improve this story, the writer/filmmakers needed to understand who their villains are and what motivates them. After that, they needed to give this information in dramatic form to us. Had the film team done so, they would've significantly increased the quality of their story. You can't ignore your villain. He/she drives almost everything in the story - they are the engine. The hero/heroine basically does clean up, aka stopping the villain(s). The hero/heroine gets the glory, but without an understandable villain doing vile things, the hero/heroine has nothing to do. In this story, the villain does vile things, but why, and to what end, isn't demonstrated, and so the Keanu character makes no sense, and Tiger's defeat of him means little. Hopefully in Keanu's next directing project the villain will be developed more fully.",2,not bad for a first directorial effort (SPOILERS)...,1397952000,"04 20, 2014",2014,12612,"[""'m"", 'big',

Tiger Chen plays the sole student of the last master of a highly potent form of martial arts Tai Chi, who is lured by a businessman/ultra-elite underground fight tournament owner Keanu Reaves (who also directed) into a path of increasingly dangerous contests and increasing personal darkness  Reaves's character's legitimate business is security, and so he has tie-ins to all kinds of personal, corporate and government-owned surveillance cameras, security systems, electric eyes, etc.; they even have devices planted in the televisions, etc. of persons thet're interested in, such as Chen, and their family members.  All this gives the organization a really sinister, 'omnipresent' feel, which helps lead in to a running undercurrent I'll get to in a minute.The action is outstanding, even by the high norms of Asian action movies, and the production is sleek and visually powerful.  There are good subplots involving the growing estrangement between Chen and his mentor, and involving the Chinese police's efforts to crack the organization, who they know of in detail but can prove nothing, and can't move against with so many powerful, big-money people involved.It's in the organization and in Reaves's character that we find possibly the most intriguing subplot.  Aside from it being obvious that it has far more money and resources than you'd expect from your average mob-run fight club, the true motivations beyond what they're doing seem to go deeper than just the fights, and deeper than the explanation given before one of the big events about three quarters of the way in.  Buried between the lines are, to my interpretation, clues that the organization's hierarchy is looking for a lot more than just the next big draw to their shows, and also (I hope I'm not giving anything away, but this seemed evident to me from early on) that there seems to be a strange, even inhuman aspect to Reaves and at least one of his higher henchmen.  It's a fascinating angle with lots of possibilities, but even without it this is a first-rate, dramatic modern-day Chinese martial arts movie, deserving of a far bigger audience than what it seems to have gotten so far, and surpassing my expectations.",5,Great Action Movie With Very Unusual 'Between-The-Lines' Undercurrents,1393113600,"02 23, 2014",2014,2334,"['Man', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'superior', 'criminal', 'underworld/undergroud', 'fighting', 'club', 'action', 'movie', 'also', 'unusual', 'undercurrents', 'going', 'Tiger', 'Chen', 'sole', 'student', 'last', 'master', 'highly', 'potent', 'form', 'martial', 'arts', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'who', 'lured', 'businessman/ultra-elite', 'underground', 'fight', 'tournament', 'owner', 'Keanu', 'Reaves', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'path', 'increasingly', 'dangerous', 'contests', 'increasing', 'personal', 'darkness', 'Reaves', 'character', 'legitimate', 'business', 'security', 'so', 'tie-ins', 'kinds', 'personal', 'corporate', 'government-owned', 'surveillance', 'cameras', 'security', 'systems', 'electric', 'eyes', 'etc', 'even', 'have', 'devices', 'planted', 'televisions', 'etc', 'persons', 'thet', ""'re"", 'interested', 'such', 'Chen', 'family', 'members', 'organization', 'really', 'sinister', ""'omnipresent"", 'feel', 'lead', 'running', 'undercurrent', ""'ll"", 'get', 'minute.The', 'action', 'outstanding', 'even', 'high', 'norms', 'Asian', 'action', 'movies', 'production', 'sleek', 'visually', 'powerful', 'are', 'good', 'subplots', 'involving', 'growing', 'estrangement', 'Chen', 'mentor', 'involving', 'Chinese', 'police', 'efforts', 'crack', 'organization', 'who', 'know', 'detail', 'can', 'prove', 'nothing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'move', 'so', 'many', 'powerful', 'big-money', 'people', 'involved.It', 'organization', 'Reaves', 'character', 'find', 'possibly', 'most', 'intriguing', 'subplot', 'Aside', 'being', 'obvious', 'far', 'more', 'money', 'resources', ""'d"", 'expect', 'average', 'mob-run', 'fight', 'club', 'true', 'motivations', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'seem', 'go', 'deeper', 'just', 'fights', 'deeper', 'explanation', 'given', 'one', 'big', 'events', 'three', 'quarters', 'way', 'Buried', 'lines', 'are', 'interpretation', 'clues', 'organization', 'hierarchy', 'looking', 'lot', 'more', 'just', 'next', 'big', 'draw', 'shows', 'also', 'hope', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'seemed', 'evident', 'early', 'be', 'strange', 'even', 'inhuman', 'aspect', 'Reaves', 'least', 'one', 'higher', 'henchmen', 'fascinating', 'angle', 'lots', 'possibilities', 'even', 'first-rate', 'dramatic', 'modern-day', 'Chinese', 'martial', 'arts', 'movie', 'deserving', 'far', 'bigger', 'audience', 'what', 'have', 'gotten', 'so', 'far', 'surpassing', 'expectations']",N/A
1671263,A21S5SVCEPCZNC,B00FEHCQEC,steve,"[0, 0]","The basic story elements are there for a good story, but the execution falls flat.  The basic story is a modern take on 80's kung fu movies.  A young expert martial artist (Chen Lin-Hu) is torn between two masters.  One master is good and one is evil (Reeves).  Reeves wants to corrupt young Tiger into an underground fight club killer.  The problem for me is that I didn't quite believe Tiger's descent into temptation because the movie did an inadequate job setting up need, doubt, and desire in Tiger to start the movie.  We see he lives a quiet and frugal life, but not that he is discontent with it or that he desires something more.  Reeve's only leverage into corrupting Chen is through the temple Chen studied in.  The movie doesn't do enough to delve into Chen's inner conflicts.  That could have made a huge difference in the movie.  Further, Reeves character is flat and uninteresting.  He isn't an archetype villain, he is a stereotype.  I expected so much more from an actor of his caliber.  Ultimately, the central crisis that Chen must make falls flat and thus the climax falls flat. I think that is mainly because the lack of internal character development in Chen.  This movie could have been so much deeper if they had taken a few more minutes to develop Chen's conflict, Reeve's character, and perhaps a direct confrontation between masters (Darth Vader vs. Obi Wan type thing).That said, there is much to enjoy.  The fight sequences are fun and I thought it did a good job of mixing Chinese and English.

1671269,A2W8H62ICF3OHJ,B00FEHCQEC,"T. Hunt ""wasabi crush""","[3, 3]","Man of Tai Chi is a 2013 Chinese-American martial arts film directed by Keanu Reeves.  Starring Keanu's real-life trainer Tiger Chen, it tells the story of a Tai Chi student bent on proving this style is more than just exercise - it's combat capable.The storyline is a little tired.  Tiger initially is working his way through the tournament circuit to showcase his theory but is soon approached by Donaka, the proprietor of an elegant, spectator-driven blood sport, and is offered a position in this world.  Tiger's first reaction is to decline, advising that fighting for money isn't the Tai Chi way, but quickly changes his tune once the government threatens to commandeer his master's training temple in the mountains over its fire danger from disrepair.  He has thirty days to get it fixed and this, you understand, is expensive.  Cue the fight contract.  I don't need to see anymore films where people have x-amount of days to come up with x-amount of funds.  There are better ways to invoke heroics and passion in a protagonist, especially in the martial arts genre.  That being said, the relationship between Tiger and his master played out well and for that I'll give the writers a little credit.The cinematography is solid and enjoyable.  This is a crisp film and houses some neat little bursts of original Chinese cityscape shots and environment ambiance, especially the fight locations - they were gorgeous.  Were it not for the camerawork, I'd have spent the duration of Keanu's project staring off listlessly in between fight scenes.  This carried a lot of the slack left behind by this shrug of a script and I was thankful for it.The acting performances were so-so.  I think Tiger did a fine job and I look forward to seeing his future works, but Keanu was dead weight and it made the movie awkward.  Per usual, this is just another Keanu performance where Keanu is being Keanu and it was dissatisfying from top to bottom.  He's stony and surly here, glaring throughout every scene and pushing his lines out as if they've some resistant MASS to them.  This is obviously my amateurish opinion - I'm only a basement den movie watcher - but the dude reads one note and it's been that way for a long time.  But some folks love Keanu and they'll probably love him here, too.  He's just not my cup of tea.The fight scenes were good.  Not great, but worth watching, no doubt.  Tai Chi is beautiful on its own and the sparring sessions between Tiger and Master Yang were invigorating to watch.  As the film progresses the fights, of course, become incrementally more difficult for Tiger and he's tasked with sorting out a variety of styles to succeed against.  Paralleling this climb is a slight nudge in the superhuman elements of martial arts.  The bodies thrown start showing that wire-line, in-air loft and it becomes a bit unrealistic, but not egregiously so.  I'd have preferred that it not dip into that realm of unbelievability but again, it didn't go too far.  I'd recommend the film on these battles alone - they're absolutely worth a rental.  Good stuff.In the end, though, as a whole, I was underwhelmed.  Man of Tai Chi is pushing two hours and a good chunk of that is spent following arcs that didn't excite me.  There's some quiet semblance of a romance and we follow a detective, (Karen Mok - haven't seen her in awhile), as she pursues the sport criminally, neither of which threw hooks at me.  But this is, at the end of the day, a fight film and in THAT arena, I think it does enough to garner a sit-down.  I wouldn't recommend buying the film as the replay value, for me anyway, wasn't there.  I'd rent it first.And I thank you for your time.",3,"""He used soft style but in a hard way.""",1396828800,"04 7, 2014",2014,3669,"['Man', 'Tai', 'Chi', '2013', 'Chinese-American', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'directed', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Starring', 'Keanu', 'real-life', 'trainer', 'Tiger', 'Chen', 'story', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'student', 'bent', 'proving', 'style', 'more', 'just', 'exercise', 'combat', 'capable.The', 'storyline', 'little', 'tired', 'Tiger', 'initially', 'working', 'way', 'tournament', 'circuit', 'showcase', 'theory', 'soon', 'approached', 'Donaka', 'proprietor', 'elegant', 'spectator-driven', 'blood', 'sport', 'offered', 'position', 'world', 'Tiger', 'first', 'reaction', 'decline', 'advising', 'fighting', 'money', ""n't"", 'Tai', 'Chi', 'way', 'quickly', 'tune', 'government', 'commandeer', 'master', 'training', 'temple', 'mountains', 'fire', 'danger', 'disrepair', 'thirty', 'days', 'get', 'fixed', 'understand', 'expensive', 'Cue', 'fight', 'contract', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'anymore', 'films', 'where', 'people', 'have', 'x-amount', 'days', 'come', 'up', 'x-amount', 'funds', 'are', 'better', 'ways', 'invoke', 'heroics', 'passion', 'protagonist', 'especially', 'martial', 'arts', 'genre', 'being', 'said', 'relationship', 'Tiger', 'master', 'played', 'out', 'well', ""'ll"", 'give', 'writers', 'little', 'credit.The', 'cinematography', 'solid', 'enjoyable', 'crisp', 'film', 'houses', 'neat', 'little', 'bursts', 'original', 'Chinese', 'cityscape', 'shots', 'environment', 'ambiance', 'especially', 'fight', 'locations', 'were', 'gorgeous', 'Were', 'not', 'camerawork', ""'d"", 'have', 'spent', 'duration', 'Keanu', 'project', 'staring', 'off', 'listlessly', 'fight', 'scenes', 'carried', 'lot', 'slack', 'left', 'behind', 'shrug', 'script', 'was', 'thankful', 'it.The', 'acting', 'performances', 'were', 'so-so', 'think', 'Tiger', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'future', 'Keanu', 'was', 'dead', 'weight', 'made', 'movie', 'awkward', 'Per', 'usual', 'just', 'Keanu', 'performance', 'where', 'Keanu', 'being', 'Keanu', 'was', 'dissatisfying', 'top', 'bottom', 'stony', 'surly', 'here', 'glaring', 'scene', 'pushing', 'lines', 'out', ""'ve"", 'resistant', 'MASS', 'obviously', 'amateurish', 'opinion', ""'m"", 'only', 'basement', 'den', 'movie', 'watcher', 'dude', 'one', 'note', 'been', 'way', 'long', 'time', 'folks', 'love', 'Keanu', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'love', 'here', 'too', 'just', 'not', 'cup', 'tea.The', 'fight', 'scenes', 'were', 'good', 'Not', 'great', 'worth', 'watching', 'doubt', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'beautiful', 'own', 'sparring', 'sessions', 'Tiger', 'Master', 'Yang', 'were', 'invigorating', 'watch', 'film', 'fights', 'course', 'become', 'incrementally', 'more', 'difficult', 'Tiger', 'tasked', 'sorting', 'out', 'variety', 'styles', 'succeed', 'Paralleling', 'climb', 'slight', 'nudge', 'superhuman', 'elements', 'martial', 'arts', 'bodies', 'start', 'showing', 'wire-line', 'in-air', 'loft', 'bit', 'unrealistic', 'not', 'egregiously', 'so', ""'d"", 'have', 'preferred', 'not', 'dip', 'realm', 'unbelievability', 'again', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'far', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'film', 'battles', 'alone', ""'re"", 'absolutely', 'rental', 'Good', 'stuff.In', 'end', 'though', 'whole', 'was', 'underwhelmed', 'Man', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'pushing', 'two', 'hours', 'good', 'chunk', 'spent', 'following', 'arcs', 'did', ""n't"", 'excite', 'quiet', 'semblance', 'romance', 'follow', 'detective', 'Karen', 'Mok', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'awhile', 'sport', 'criminally', 'threw', 'hooks', 'end', 'day', 'fight', 'film', 'THAT', 'arena', 'think', 'enough', 'garner', 'sit-down', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'buying', 'film', 'replay', 'value', 'anyway', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', ""'d"", 'rent', 'first.And', 'thank', 'time']",N/A
