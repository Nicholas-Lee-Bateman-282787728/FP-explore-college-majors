So I won't talk about it as a dvd.As a film, this is one of my favorite movies. Overlooking some of the problems it has with being realistic, it is one of Slater's stronger roles, and the type of role he plays well. The film attempts to tackle many issues, foremost being censorship. Whether or not it does a good job, I leave that you to decide. The movie also tries to be the 'voice' of a generation. And while it has a lot to say, has become a cult classic, and is full of great sound bites, I don't think the film achieved all the filmmakers set out to do. But it is an entertaining movie that gives you a lot to think about.",4,talk hard,1028160000,"08 1, 2002",2002,697,"['dvd', 'am', 'bit', 'disapointed', 'extras', 'commentary', 'nothing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'talk', 'dvd.As', 'film', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'Overlooking', 'problems', 'being', 'realistic', 'one', 'Slater', 'stronger', 'roles', 'type', 'role', 'well', 'film', 'attempts', 'tackle', 'many', 'issues', 'foremost', 'being', 'censorship', 'not', 'good', 'job', 'leave', 'decide', 'movie', 'also', 'be', ""'voice"", ""'"", 'generation', 'lot', 'say', 'become', 'cult', 'classic', 'full', 'great', 'sound', 'bites', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'achieved', 'filmmakers', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'lot', 'think']",Pump Up the Volume VHS

It is too juvenile and superficial. There are too much close-ups on people's faces throughout the film. Thinking that when they are listening, I am being forced to follow the steps. Spoken words of Hard Harry were useless because there are clear alternatives to combat the problem. It seems like 95%-100% of the students at that high school in this movie face the same dilemma. To me, the figure is actually much lower. Allan Moyle didn't present the conflict of the story clearly until way in the end of the film. Finally when the message was showed, it left me saying, ""That's all? That's why?"". Lacking strength in the acting department for almost everybody, only Slater did a great job of carrying on.

Scribe ""trekviewer""","[8, 11]","It's funny how the years can alter your view of the world...A dozen years ago I was a freewheeling do-as-I-wish dissenter of society and I loved the spirit of the kids in this film.  My how the times have changed!Christian Slater stars as Mark Hunter a shy and introverted studious teenager by day who is harboring a secret identity from everyone else. Hunter has recently moved to the Arizona city of Paradise Valley and is attending the local high school Hubert Humphrey High, where all the students are at odds with the hardnosed bully of a principal. To combat both his own awkward attempts at conversations with fellow students (especially girls) and the intensely disliked principal, Mark becomes a pirate DJ using his short-wave radio his parents gave him for a gift. Behind the microphone and closed doors Mark becomes 'Hard Harry' who lives and breathes his motto ""Talk Hard"" nightly beginning at 10 sharp. His alternately bellicose and sanguine rants become 'a voice crying in the wilderness' for the students at HHH and overnight 'Hard Harry' becomes a hometown celebrity that has everyone at the high school talking about him. Suddenly the teenagers that were growing complacent and resigned to the rules, regulations and restrictions enforced upon them begin to liberate themselves. Students play their recorded tapes of his broadcast on boom boxes during the school lunch hour and they become the bane of the teachers who dislike the uncensored monologues, especially the putdowns of the teachers and principal who are named on the broadcasts. But when one of the callers to 'Hard Harry' commits suicide, the high school's core of leadership blame him for provoking the incident. The students naturally rebel against this unjust condemnation of their ""hero of the airwaves"" and begin expressing their indifference to the school officials. When it becomes a full-blown anarchy the local authorities and the FCC are called in to track 'Hard Harry' down and get him off the air leading to a final confrontation between the teenagers and the adults.Slater is cast perfectly as 'Hard Harry' and he steals the entire proceedings, far outshining any of the others in the movie. All of the teenagers are well cast and are entirely believable throughout the picture, but they remain mostly undefined with the exception of Samantha Mathis who plays Slater's love interest. Still director Allan Moyle ('Empire Records') creates an honest portrait of teen life as less than idyllic and somewhat cold. Teens are shown as being trapped within believable personal hells, problematic circles of existence and strained family relationships. While these seem like expected clich&eacute;s in movies about teen angst Moyle gets his cast to bring them off with conviction. This practical approach doesn't get carried over to the adults however. Instead the student's rebellion is shown to be against an abhorrent and corrupt school administration run by heartless teachers and frigid officials wielding a cruel authority. At one point a school official (depicted in one-dimensional and unintentional hilarity) beats an expelled student who has come by the school to say he has the right to an education. Of course this happens in front of the entire student body during lunch hour and this incident sets off a riot at the school and results in the police and eventually the FCC getting involved. Why has Moyle created such an obvious juxtaposition of forces? The answer is simple...Hollywood doesn't take on 'the system'.  Anti-establishment films are the forte of independent filmmakers and there are many such fine films out there worth searching out. In New Line Entertainment's 'Pump Up The Volume' Moyle is able to push the envelope only so far before he is forced to feel the constraints of an authority figure telling him ""NO!"" - ironically in much the same way the teens in the movie do!Another small problem with the film has to do with the character of 'Hard Harry'. Early on he rants on-air about the 60's radicals and the protests they incited, their collective disillusionment and anger against ""the system"" and how ""they were gonna' change the world."" He observes that they weren't anything but a lot of wind and that in fact nothing has changed. Yet 'Hard Harry' is so obviously a composite of Lenny Bruce and Abbie Hoffman that this sentiment is improperly placed here; during the early part of the film Slater reads Bruce's 'How To Talk Dirty And Influence People' and he sounds, acts and expresses himself exactly like a 60's radical. He's supposedly raving like this because of his personal disappointment with his parents, former 60's radicals now Ma & Pa 'yuppie'. Logically I suppose an inexperienced and wet-behind-the-ears teen would make such outlandish statements while being exactly what he is condemning but it still seems false and insensible.Still the film is well worth seeing for Slater's terrific star-making performance; when he urges the students to buck the societal conventions being pressed down upon them and suggests alternatives to conformity, he does so in such an honest, rational, likable - albeit profane - way that it's a genuine crowd pleasing moment. And despite my misgivings about some of the content of this film I still recommend a viewing because of it's stance against the oppression of censorship and also the great upbeat and fist-pumping ending - and Slater has one of the best closing lines in any film you'll see. 80's music aficionados will also appreciate the well-chosen songs that make up the superb soundtrack.",3,Christian Slater

We can all concur for the most part that Christian Slater just stinks in almost every film, but in this role, it was as if the script God's were looking down upon him and well they gave him his crown jewel. Arguably the best film Slater has been in, perhaps saving 'Interview With a Vampire', however I think even Billy Boyd would have been good in that role, so enough said.Anytime I need some uplifting strides, or I hear the call for inspiration in one form or another, I will throw Pump Up The Volume in, and even though it can be a bit over the top in some areas, there are moments of exceptional purity and realism in Slater's character, nevermind countless memorable quotes, to pronounce one of my favorites that opens the film if you will so let me:""You ever get the feeling that everything in America is completely ***** up. You know that feeling that the whole country is like one inch away from saying 'That's it, forget it.' I mean think about it. Everything is polluted. The environment, the government, the schools you name it. Speaking of schools, I was walking the hound halls the other day and I asked myself, ""Is there life after high school?"" Because I can't face tomorrow, let alone a whole year of this sh**. Yeah, you got it folks. It's me again with a little attitude for all you out here in Whitebread Land. All you nice people living in the middle of America the beautiful. Lets see, we're on er 92 FM tonight and it feels like a nice clean little band so far. No one else is using it. The price is right. Heh, heh. And yes folks you guessed it. Tonight I am as horny as a ten peckered owl, so stay tuned because this is Happy Harry Hardon reminding you to eat your cereal with a fork and do your homework in the dark.""Crisp voice, surreal opening, haunting even. Slater is surely endearing in this role. I really can't see anyone doing this except him. There are so many younger folks I give this to and they simply consider it one of the best movies ever, and why not?

She was ""strange"" but strong. She tracked down this elusive underground DJ and made him hers. She just seemed pretentious and overbearing to me. I appreciate the sentiment of the film. Christian Slater is good as the underground DJ running an independent radio station, but of course, things get out of hand and his advice triggers some rather unfortunate events. The escalation of events is so unrealistic and silly, though, that I have to wonder about why this was so popular. I guess it was popular with young people because they like to feel like they have power or a voice. Or they like to be portrayed as though they do.

In a lot of ways, I was a lot like Mark.  I couldn't talk to people, either.  I felt really connected with the character and marvelled at the guts the film had in portraying serious subject matter and dealing with it in an intelligent, believable manner.  When I look at the so-called teen films of today, I miss the real edge of films like ""Pump Up the Volume"" and ""The Breakfast Club.""  These were the teen films that truly mattered...the ones that had something important to say.  ""Pump Up the Volume"" personifies that genre, as far as I'm concerned...even moreso than ""The Breakfast Club,"" which, despite its brilliance, occasionally (though not frequently) lapsed into unbelievable situations.  And to the reviewer who asked what was wrong with Hubert H. Humphrey High School, just look at the actions of the principal...that should clear it up.  Students were being expelled on specious grounds simply because she considered them ""unfortunate.""  This is why she was eventually (and thankfully) suspended from her administrative position.  The school was an absolute travesty.  It was this, coupled with Mark's feelings of alienation and isolation, that drove him to such extremes in his all-too-perceptive rants.  Mark invented Hard Harry so that he could say all of the things he truly felt, but felt unable to say himself.  I did the same thing in school, inventing an alter-ego for myself who could stand up for himself and say whatever was on his mind.  I didn't use pirate radio, of course...I just went out into the world in my new persona and found that people actually started to listen...just like they listened to Mark when he became Harry.  All in all, this film made a serious impact on my life and has many important things to say to people of any age...and especially to teens.  The performances are stunning all around, particularly Christian Slater (in his finest role) and Samantha Mathis (who is equally capable and absolutely perfect in the role of Nora).  This film will make you laugh, make you think, and may even make you cry.

Schweitzer ""zohoe""","[8, 9]","Pump Up The Volume is probably one of the first of the ""Gen X"" movies to appear in the wake of the John Hughes classics of the early and mid-80s.  This film, released in 1990, touches on a myriad of issues that effect teens today as then.  They don't seem to make movies like this anymore, movies that touch on serious issues as isolation, alienation, sexuality, education reform, freedom of speech, censorship, suicide, the failure of mandatory standardized scholastic testing, etc etc.  This movie has got it all.  The story revolves around a quiet student at Hubert Humphrey High, a large suburban school in Arizona.  His parents are sell-out former hippies who have produced in him a resentment of the failed idealistic values of the 60s generation which have created a fallout whose repercussions are still felt today.  Mark is a loner who cannot communuicate with his teachers or his peers.  He is an intelligent and creative recluse who eats his lunch alone, reading a book, while the problems of high school life swirl around him.  It is only as his secret pirate radio alter-ego Hard Harry that he finds his voice and is able to speak to those diseffected peers who share his fate at a school that reflects the flawed and conformist society at large that has not only overlooked the problems of his generation, but continues to add to them by treating the kids as second-class citizens.  The school princial, who is obsessed with standardized test scores and the prestige of her school, flags ""problem"" students who threaten to tarnish school image and pull down test scores and has them expelled rather than try to help these kids who truly need help, while the school councelor rats out these same students to the corrupt administration when he should be the one providing them with the guidance they need.  And to make matters worse, the one concerned teacher who dares to stand up for her students is fired for insubordination.  As Hard Harry begins to make an impact, other afflicted students begin to open up with their problems to an outlet thatn is genuine and not some contrived school-sponsered joke.  Harry confronts a isolated over-achiever who takes his own life rather than face another day at his ""award-winning"" school.  Another caller describes an incident of homophobic violence commited by the school jocks.  In the end, Harry finds he must face his problems without his mask of anonyimity and face up to being the icon of hope that he has become.  Pump Up the Volume is a fine movie with a great soundtrack and speaks to alot of the issues that plauge us in this post-Columbine age.

384503,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,6303675034,Michael Butts,"[4, 26]","Having been a teenager once, I can certainly understand the inner turmoil and angst teens experience.  However, in PUMP UP THE VOLUME, the movie's attempt to martyrize teens and make all adults look like uncaring morons only serves to underscore why so many adults look with disdain on teens.  The teens in this movie seem to have little respect for authority and their assignation as to being tortured and misunderstood is vanquished in their juvenile behavior.  Even our hero (well played by Christian Slater) cannot communicate with people on a one to one level; he instead decides to become some kind of salvation to his teens by using his pirated radio shows to cause some kind of uprising among them.  As a proponent of truth, he is a vapid antithesis of truth: he fakes masturbation to arouse the youths; he doesn't use his real name or voice; and on a call with a potential suicide victim, he treats the caller as someone who isn't serious and never really offers any kind of consolation.  The suicidal teen says he is lonely and we automatically assume he is lonely within his familial structure, but isn't he just as lonely with the peers who mourn him after his demise?

384514,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,6303675034,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[2, 5]","Christian Slater is Mark Hunter, a nerdy Eastern transplant to an Arizona school.  Completely overlooked by his easy-going parents and everybody else, Hunter runs a pirate radio station under the name ""Hard Harry"".  Every night, the hordes of students who think nothing of Hunter, listen for every syllable of Harry's voice.  Hunter laces his subversive radio with mixtures of Lenny Bruce and the likes of ""Concrete Blond"", and everybody loves it.  Everybody that is but the stern,  authoritarian and uptight nerds who live for nothing but make life miserable for everybody younger than they are.  Hunter is a man with ideas, but he can only express them through Harry - he alters his voice for radio, and uses an anonymous mail box to collect fan mail - keeping his double life a secret.  Unfortunately, Nora (Samantha Mathis), an introverted intellectual teen who works the library at Hunter's school, pieces together the clues of Hunter's &amp; Harry's shared ID.Until then, ""Pump"" is sheer fun, an equal opportunity offender that doesn't strain your sense of morality.  The adults are easy targets (even Hunter's parents are out  to lunch - they never realize that their son's got enough electronic equipment to be the ""Hard Harry"" that everybody is talking about; the rest of the adults fail to consider Harry's message as a wake-up call).  But the teens are also pretty wasted - for all of their energy, they never convert their power into a cause (the script wakes up near the end, and crafts a genuine cause involving manipulation of student scores - a revelation hit on by a ""friendly"" teacher played by Ellen Greene of ""Little Shop of Horrors"" fame).  Instead of rising up against some perceived evil, Hunter's fellow teens merely become louder versions of the same annoying and cliquish high schoolers that we've seen in countless flicks (typically starring Corey's Feldman &amp; Haim, and Larry Linville or Mary Woronov as the evil principal).  Even after essentially telling his listeners what kind of person he really is, none seek him out.  They're not after Hunter's reality, only Harry's wicked construction.  It's good clean fun, and Harry's rants are so irresistible, you'd be willing to sit through about 2 hours of it.  Though Hunter/Harry talks to the disaffection of Teen-America, little in the surrounding setting bears out how much trouble we're in (clue: though a bastion of adult-managed conformity, Hunter's school still keeps the library stocked with Lenny Bruce).Unfortunately, in true shock-jock tradition, Harry/Hunter's words become entangled with tragedy when a local teen commits suicide shortly after calling in.  Faster than you can say ""Good Morning Vietnam"", Hunter dumps than resurrects Harry's persona - only now he's on a mission, and ""Pump"" becomes more serious than it proves to deserve.  Still missing the genuine story underneath the story, the teens become louder, and the adults more repressive (one of the teens is brutally assaulted by one of the school's employees) and the script more satisfied with how it delivers Harry's message than how it can convincingly craft one.  At that point, ""Pump"" transforms from an engaging comedy into a weighed-down message movie, one that spoils the fun of both halves.  By the end, you feel like you've been watching less of a movie, than a really long and loud &quot;After School Special&quot;.",3,shallow teen flick weighed down by self-awareness,1088121600,"06 25, 2004",2004,3383,"['Christian', 'Slater', 'Mark', 'Hunter', 'nerdy', 'Eastern', 'transplant', 'Arizona', 'school', 'Completely', 'overlooked', 'easy-going', 'parents', 'everybody', 'else', 'Hunter', 'pirate', 'radio', 'station', 'name', 'Hard', 'Harry', 'night', 'hordes', 'students', 'who', 'think', 'nothing', 'Hunter', 'listen', 'syllable', 'Harry', 'voice', 'Hunter', 'subversive', 'radio', 'mixtures', 'Lenny', 'Bruce', 'likes', 'Concrete', 'Blond', 'everybody', 'Everybody', 'stern', 'authoritarian', 'uptight', 'nerds', 'who', 'live', 'nothing', 'make', 'life', 'miserable', 'everybody', 'younger', 'are', 'Hunter', 'man', 'ideas', 'can', 'only', 'express', 'Harry', 'voice', 'radio', 'anonymous', 'mail', 'box', 'collect', 'fan', 'mail', 'keeping', 'double', 'life', 'secret', 'Unfortunately', 'Nora', 'Samantha', 'Mathis', 'introverted', 'intellectual', 'teen', 'who', 'library', 'Hunter', 'school', 'together', 'clues', 'Hunter', 'amp', 'Harry', 'shared', 'ID.Until', 'then', 'Pump', 'sheer', 'fun', 'equal', 'opportunity', 'offender', ""n't"", 'strain', 'sense', 'morality', 'adults', 'are', 'easy', 'targets', 'even', 'Hunter', 'parents', 'are', 'lunch', 'never', 'realize', 'son', 'got', 'enough', 'electronic', 'equipment', 'be', 'Hard', 'Harry', 'everybody', 'talking', 'rest', 'adults', 'fail', 'consider', 'Harry', 'message', 'wake-up', 'call', 'teens', 'are', 'also', 'pretty', 'wasted', 'energy', 'never', 'convert', 'power', 'cause', 'script', 'up', 'end', 'genuine', 'cause', 'involving', 'manipulation', 'student', 'scores', 'revelation', 'hit', 'friendly', 'teacher', 'played', 'Ellen', 'Greene', 'Little', 'Shop', 'Horrors', 'fame', 'Instead', 'rising', 'up', 'perceived', 'evil', 'Hunter', 'fellow', 'merely', 'become', 'louder', 'versions', 'same', 'annoying', 'cliquish', 'high', 'schoolers', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'countless', 'flicks', 'typically', 'starring', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'amp', 'Haim', 'Larry', 'Linville', 'Mary', 'Woronov', 'evil', 'principal', 'Even', 'essentially', 'telling', 'listeners', 'what', 'kind', 'person', 'really', 'none', 'seek', 'out', ""'re"", 'not', 'Hunter', 'reality', 'only', 'Harry', 'wicked', 'construction', 'good', 'clean', 'fun', 'Harry', 'rants', 'are', 'so', 'irresistible', ""'d"", 'be', 'willing', 'sit', 'about', '2', 'hours', 'Hunter/Harry', 'talks', 'disaffection', 'Teen-America', 'little', 'surrounding', 'setting', 'bears', 'out', 'how', 'much', 'trouble', ""'re"", 'clue', 'bastion', 'adult-managed', 'conformity', 'Hunter', 'school', 'still', 'library', 'stocked', 'Lenny', 'Bruce', '.Unfortunately', 'true', 'shock-jock', 'tradition', 'Harry/Hunter', 'words', 'become', 'entangled', 'tragedy', 'when', 'local', 'teen', 'commits', 'suicide', 'shortly', 'calling', 'Faster', 'can', 'say', 'Good', 'Morning', 'Vietnam', 'Hunter', 'resurrects', 'Harry', 'persona', 'only', 'now', 'mission', 'Pump', 'more', 'serious', 'deserve', 'Still', 'missing', 'genuine', 'story', 'story', 'teens', 'become', 'louder', 'adults', 'more', 'repressive', 'one', 'teens', 'brutally', 'assaulted', 'one', 'school', 'employees', 'script', 'more', 'satisfied', 'how', 'Harry', 'message', 'how', 'can', 'convincingly', 'craft', 'one', 'point', 'Pump', 'transforms', 'engaging', 'comedy', 'weighed-down', 'message', 'movie', 'one', 'fun', 'halves', 'end', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'less', 'movie', 'really', 'long', 'loud', 'quot', 'School', 'Special', 'quot']",Pump Up the Volume VHS
