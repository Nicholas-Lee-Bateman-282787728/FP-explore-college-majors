Biker""","[13, 14]","In a nutshell: this flick has all the shortcomings of late night cable tv soft-core porn, with none of the advantages.The long form: everything about this movie screams ""BUDGET!"": hack writing [seriously, I could've written better dialog, & I'm as Wonderbread as they come!], super tight camera angles (to disguise the fact that they were shooting all the exteriors on the same street w/o having to hassle w/ permitting perhaps?), mid-70s monoaural sound quality, casting unknowns, etc. etc.As far as I'm concerned, the only reason to own this movie is so you can see how far Tiffany Hines outshines the material she was given; I expect to see her become a big star! All the other talent turn in decent performances too, but they're really held back by the material they were given: Ms. Hines has the ability to take what she's given & run with it, regardless.The only way to save this dog would be if there'd been more skin, as it is, the story & characters aren't very believable, the pacing is poor, and the direction is so marginal it intrudes upon the story.",2,So much wasted potential..,1281830400,"08 15, 2010",2010,1063,"['nutshell', 'flick', 'shortcomings', 'late', 'night', 'cable', 'tv', 'soft-core', 'porn', 'none', 'advantages.The', 'long', 'form', 'everything', 'movie', 'BUDGET', 'hack', 'writing', '[', 'seriously', 'could', ""'ve"", 'written', 'better', 'dialog', ""'m"", 'as', 'Wonderbread', 'come', ']', 'super', 'tight', 'camera', 'angles', 'disguise', 'fact', 'were', 'shooting', 'exteriors', 'same', 'street', 'w/o', 'having', 'hassle', 'w/', 'permitting', 'perhaps', 'mid-70s', 'monoaural', 'sound', 'quality', 'casting', 'unknowns', 'etc', 'etc.As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'only', 'reason', 'own', 'movie', 'so', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'Tiffany', 'Hines', 'material', 'was', 'given', 'expect', 'see', 'become', 'big', 'star', 'other', 'talent', 'turn', 'decent', 'performances', 'too', ""'re"", 'really', 'held', 'back', 'material', 'were', 'given', 'Ms.', 'Hines', 'ability', 'take', 'what', 'given', 'run', 'only', 'way', 'save', 'dog', 'would', 'be', ""'d"", 'been', 'more', 'skin', 'story', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'believable', 'pacing', 'poor', 'direction', 'so', 'marginal', 'story']",Perfect Combination

I really like the movie the cast is potent, it has star power The script had bite but needed more tweaking by the director...

The actors came, the conquered.., But the picture quality of movies like love & basketball, Brothers,Soul food has set the bar real high... One scene, the club or party was to dark.., The shower scene was smoking but the set looked B-list...
