893917,A2UKC6QFG9L5GV,B0007XG4FA,Anton Ilinski,"[1, 3]","Ebola Syndrome is for the die-hard exploitation movies fans who like gratuitous violence and sick fun of such films. Herman Yau, the director of this masterpiece, previously worked with Danny Lee on the set of The Untold Story and took two things from that film into his new opus. First - lots of gore, second - Anthony Wong, who brilliantly managed the role of a psycho killer as well as in The Untold Story. Actually Anthony Wong is the only worthwhile reason to see Ebola Syndrome, he plays one of the most deranged characters that I've seen in movies. All other aspects of this film - whether it's cinematography or story-line are just stupid. But you may still like it if you enjoy sleazy flicks. After all it's funny to a certain extent.Kai is sleeping with his boss's wife. Being caught red-handed and bullied by the boss he goes completely nuts (as he already was mentally unstable as it seems), kills both his mistress and her husband and flees Hong Kong. He finds himself in South Africa, working in a restaurant. One day he rapes a Zulu girl who obviously was ebola infected and contracts this lethal desease. But he turns out to be one in a million that can spread it without getting sick himself. So the epidemic starts.Gorehounds will find everything for their pleasure here: blood, killings, dismemberment, rape, lots of nudity, frog vivisection, masturbation with meat chunks, grisly deaths etc. As I said Ebola Syndrome is very stupid, and the second star goes only for Herman Yau's ability to compile all these exploitation attributes in one place, because at first this task seems impossible - you'll literally find anything to your liking here. And if it's more important to you than a story-line and common sense, you'll enjoy this piece immensely.",2,EXPLOITATION FAN'S DREAM,1172793600,"03 2, 2007",2007,1769,"['Ebola', 'Syndrome', 'die-hard', 'exploitation', 'movies', 'fans', 'who', 'like', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'sick', 'fun', 'such', 'films', 'Herman', 'Yau', 'director', 'masterpiece', 'previously', 'worked', 'Danny', 'Lee', 'set', 'Untold', 'Story', 'took', 'two', 'things', 'film', 'new', 'opus', 'First', 'lots', 'gore', 'second', 'Anthony', 'Wong', 'who', 'brilliantly', 'managed', 'role', 'psycho', 'killer', 'as', 'well', 'Untold', 'Story', 'Actually', 'Anthony', 'Wong', 'only', 'worthwhile', 'reason', 'see', 'Ebola', 'Syndrome', 'one', 'most', 'deranged', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', 'other', 'aspects', 'film', 'cinematography', 'story-line', 'are', 'just', 'stupid', 'may', 'still', 'like', 'enjoy', 'sleazy', 'flicks', 'funny', 'certain', 'extent.Kai', 'sleeping', 'boss', 'wife', 'Being', 'caught', 'red-handed', 'bullied', 'boss', 'completely', 'nuts', 'already', 'was', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'mistress', 'husband', 'flees', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'South', 'Africa', 'working', 'restaurant', 'One', 'day', 'Zulu', 'girl', 'who', 'obviously', 'was', 'ebola', 'infected', 'contracts', 'lethal', 'desease', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'million', 'can', 'spread', 'getting', 'sick', 'epidemic', 'starts.Gorehounds', 'will', 'find', 'everything', 'pleasure', 'here', 'blood', 'killings', 'dismemberment', 'rape', 'lots', 'nudity', 'frog', 'vivisection', 'masturbation', 'meat', 'chunks', 'grisly', 'deaths', 'etc', 'said', 'Ebola', 'Syndrome', 'very', 'stupid', 'second', 'star', 'only', 'Herman', 'Yau', 'ability', 'compile', 'exploitation', 'one', 'place', 'first', 'task', 'impossible', ""'ll"", 'literally', 'find', 'anything', 'liking', 'here', 'more', 'important', 'story-line', 'common', 'sense', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'piece', 'immensely']",N/A

Once the public becomes aware of this syndrome, There is an attempt by the police to capture him for murder and to stop the spread of the Ebola syndrome.This film is very similar to the director's previous film ""The Untold Story"", Mostly because of the use of the same actor and the subject matter of using people for food.

893919,A26PEFWHKUHN7O,B0007XG4FA,Captain Insanity,"[4, 5]","Because Herman Yau & Anthony Wong are at it again!!!!The team responsible for ""The Untold Story"" are back in the kitchen.And this time, they're cooking up human pork buns in South Africa.The only difference is these Pork Buns are chock full of the Ebola Virus!!!Pretty much the same premise as ""The Untold Story""but without the police investigation angle, and twice the mayhem.While ""The Untold Story"" was a more frightening, more believable story,Ebola Syndrome is much more fun.It has twice the amount of depravities as ""Untold Story""though they're not as viscious.That was until I discovered that 99% of the deleted scenes were extended gore scenes. (Much like The Untold Story, the actual violence tends to take place offscreen)I was a little upset to say the least.You still get to see all the carnage taking place onscreen,which is grotesquely beatifuldont't get me wrong,but the camera doesn't dwell nearly as long as it should,which you'll see quite clearly in the deleted scenes.Each gore scene was supposed to be a a few seconds longer.In fact,one scene involving a chewed eye-ball was missing entirely.So in all honesty you might want to find a different version.(if there is one, which I'm pretty sure there isn't)Despite the fact that this version is alledgedly unrated.SYNOPSIS:(With almost no spoilers)Kai gets caught in the act with his boss's wife.His boss, furious, beats Kai about the apartment,This confrontation ends in a triple homicide,with their daughter as the only witness.12 years later, Kai is working in a kitchen in South Africa,for a frugal businesman, who, to save a little money,decides to buy his pork from an african tribe infected with the Ebola Virus.During their excursion Kai becomes infected, but as it turns out,he's one of 10 million who are immune to the virus,which makes him a carrier.Which means anyone coming in contact with any of his bodily fluid is infected.When they return to work, ownership of the restaurant, violently changes hands.And the previous owners are now on the menu.But someone recognizes Kairemembers him from Hong Kong,remembers what he did.Half the movie is spoken in Chinese,& the other half is spoken in bad english,Which makes for quite an unintentionally hilarious combination.It's painfully obvious that the director doesn't speak english.Because every actor not speaking chinese, was just downright awful,pure cardboard, like they were reading lines off an intelligible cue-card.Their acting, to say the least, seemed out of place.Anthony Wong however was great, in a gross kind of way.The Depravities include:- a severed tongue,- ebola rape- decapitaion- mutilation- cannibalism- toothpicks to the eye- facial urination- porkchop masturbation- chewed eye-ball- child murderetc, etc.MORAL OF THE STORY:If you can't beat 'em.........cut 'em up, and turn 'em

893921,A1VRKFWG82C3EC,B0007XG4FA,Eyes and Teeth,"[4, 4]","I have no frame of reference as to how much this film was cut from the actually originally HK release. However after doing some serious research, I have come to the conclusion that this film is only missing 3 minutes from the original disease infested masterpiece. It appears that all current DVD versions of this film came from the same print (which is actually the only print known to be in existence). Therefore, this is the best version any of us are likely to ever have the pleasure of viewing...That being said, I found this film to be incredibly entertaining and highly amusing. Once again, director Herman Yau and Cat III Master, Anthony Wong have teamed up for an exploitative winner. The first film I had the pleasure of viewing from this winning team was the amazing 'The Untold Story'. That film was based on a true story and was much more serious in tone. This little gem was much more exploitative and over-the-top...I absolutely love the plot of this masterpiece. The movie starts out with a bang (literally). Anthony Wong is caught having sex with his bosses wife. He then quickly and violently dispenses with both of them. Now of course he needs to disappear so he heads to South Africa where he obtains work in a filthy restaurant. The price of meat becomes too much for him and his boss to handle so they head into the bush to acquire some 'bush-meat'. On the way back to the city he rapes one of the natives. This woman happened to have the Ebola Virus...Luckily for us, Mr. Wong is a rare one-in-a-million case of individual who will carry the Ebola Virus without succumbing to it's terrible deadly side-effects. The rest of the film is a joy to watch as Mr. Wong careless spreads the disease to the terrified populations of South Africa and Hong Kong in various entertaining ways...Anthony Wong is pitch perfect as the perverted psychopath and Herman Yau once again provides the deft direction needed to please use gore & sleaze fiends...I don't want to give away too much of the plot (like it matters), but as a fan of sleaze, explotation, and gratuitous entertainment I can wholeheartedly reccomend this sweet little film.

He suddenly gets infected by the Ebola virus but it doesn't kill him as he becomes a carrier of the virus, he goes mad as he butchers some people to make them into special hamburgers that satisifies the costumers cravings. Unknown to them, the burgers are also contaminated with Ebola and soon Sang goes back to Hong Kong after he has found his boss's hidden money pile. Now he starts to spread the virus to some people in the city and the police with the contamination unit are on his trail.Entertaining and gory horror comedy from director Herman Yau who made the infamous Hong Kong extreme horror cult fave ""The Untold Story"" as this was a nice follow-up to his disgusting masterpiece. While not as over the top as the other film but it does offer plenty of good gore such as skin ripping, cannibalism, eye gouging and others including some sleaze abound, there is some eye pleasingly beautiful Asian girls in this movie.  It does have some dark humor to spice up the film with a dark sense of atmosphere, i recommend this to fans of horror comedies and Asian cinema.This DVD contains excellent picture and sound with the original Cantonese Language with accurate Subtitles with some fine extras like trailers to this and other titles, audio commentary, an interview with the director and Deleted Scenes.Also recommended: ""Ichi The Killer"", ""The Untold Story"", ""Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky"", ""Maniac (1980)"", ""Battle Royale"", ""Cannibal Ferox"", ""Hell of the Living Dead (aka Night of the Zombies, Virus, Zombie Creeping Flesh)"", ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre part 2"", ""Grindhouse"", ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"", ""Men Behind The Sun"", ""Bloodsucking Freaks"", ""The New York Ripper"", ""Inferno"", ""Tenebre"", ""Deep Red"", ""Hostel 1 & 2"", ""Silence of the Lambs"", ""The Crazies"", ""I Drink Your Blood"", ""The Devil's Rejects"", ""House of 1000 Corpses"", ""Hannibal"", ""Jungle Holocaust (a.k.a.

I was researching more Anthony Wong movies and found this one.I sometimes start to think I have uncovered all the great movies there are but I have found a true gem when I watched this with low expectations (due to another Amazon review stating how cut it was and thinking this would be more of a drama on the ebola virus).We have Anothony Wong back again and he is basically the same character as he is in the Untold Story.  He is a psycho restaurant worker who kills those who enrage him and end up being served to the patrons.In this story, Anthony Wong is Kai the restaurant worker who is always complaining to himself about ""being bullied"" by everyone he encounters and eventually kills three people.  This time he goes to South Africa before he gets caught.In Africa, he does a whole lot more complaining to himself about ""being bullied"" until he kills again.  Yet again, Kai goes on a killing rampage and his victims are served as tasty ""African Burgers"".  But only after going on a pig shopping trip for the restaurant where he rapes a dying African woman infected with ebola.Kai however is a one in 10 million type who can become a carrier of ebola but doesn't die from it.He soon realizes his new crimes will be discovered and escapes back to Hong Kong (10 years after leaving).  Of course, his deviant lifestyle and various altercations start him spreading his disease and leaving a trail of victims.This is all as intense as it was in the Untold Story and constantly had me laughing as well.  It may even be a little more fun than Untold Story as it has more of an adventure than Untold Story.There are plenty of scenes of Kai's misuse of meat and extreme violence that will make this a new favorite with you as well.There is another review here that discouraged my from seeing this movie further.  I believe this review is wrong.  If there is more to see, I certainly agree that all should be shown but this movie is excellent and pretty severe throughout.  It does not appear to have the intense content cut-out.  If so, I of course, would like to see what was cut out, but there is plenty exceptional content left.  Some research on my part and the stated research of the other reviewer indicates probably 3 minutes is missing and is missing due to it no longer being in existense rather than censored for this version.I don't believe this is anywhere near as known as 'the Untold Story'.  If you found this movie while searching for movies similar to it as I was and I believe will probably be the case with others as well, don't worry about the bad review here, this is a great movie and almost like having 2 more hours of Untold Story to watch.",5,Like having an Untold Story 2 made as well as the first.,1169424000,"01 22, 2007",2007,2763,"['Untold', 'Story', 'starring', 'Anthony', 'Wong', 'directed', 'Herman', 'Yau', 'one', 'top', 'favorite', 'movies', 'was', 'researching', 'more', 'Anthony', 'Wong', 'movies', 'found', 'one.I', 'sometimes', 'start', 'think', 'have', 'uncovered', 'great', 'movies', 'are', 'have', 'found', 'true', 'gem', 'when', 'watched', 'low', 'expectations', 'due', 'Amazon', 'review', 'stating', 'how', 'cut', 'was', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'drama', 'ebola', 'virus', 'have', 'Anothony', 'Wong', 'back', 'again', 'basically', 'same', 'character', 'Untold', 'Story', 'psycho', 'restaurant', 'worker', 'who', 'who', 'enrage', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'served', 'patrons.In', 'story', 'Anthony', 'Wong', 'Kai', 'restaurant', 'worker', 'who', 'always', 'complaining', 'being', 'bullied', 'everyone', 'eventually', 'kills', 'three', 'people', 'time', 'South', 'Africa', 'caught.In', 'Africa', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'complaining', 'being', 'bullied', 'again', 'again', 'Kai', 'killing', 'rampage', 'victims', 'are', 'served', 'tasty', 'African', 'Burgers', 'only', 'going', 'pig', 'shopping', 'trip', 'restaurant', 'where', 'dying', 'African', 'woman', 'infected', 'ebola.Kai', 'however', 'one', '10', 'million', 'type', 'who', 'can', 'become', 'carrier', 'ebola', ""n't"", 'die', 'it.He', 'soon', 'new', 'crimes', 'will', 'be', 'discovered', 'back', 'Hong', 'Kong', '10', 'years', 'leaving', 'course', 'deviant', 'lifestyle', 'various', 'altercations', 'start', 'spreading', 'disease', 'leaving', 'trail', 'victims.This', 'as', 'intense', 'was', 'Untold', 'Story', 'constantly', 'had', 'laughing', 'as', 'well', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'fun', 'Untold', 'Story', 'more', 'adventure', 'Untold', 'Story.There', 'are', 'plenty', 'scenes', 'Kai', 'misuse', 'meat', 'extreme', 'violence', 'will', 'make', 'new', 'favorite', 'review', 'here', 'discouraged', 'seeing', 'movie', 'further', 'believe', 'review', 'wrong', 'more', 'see', 'certainly', 'agree', 'should', 'be', 'shown', 'movie', 'excellent', 'pretty', 'severe', 'not', 'appear', 'have', 'intense', 'content', 'cut-out', 'so', 'course', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'cut', 'out', 'plenty', 'exceptional', 'content', 'left', 'research', 'part', 'stated', 'research', 'other', 'reviewer', 'probably', '3', 'minutes', 'missing', 'missing', 'due', 'no', 'longer', 'being', 'existense', 'rather', 'censored', 'version.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'anywhere', 'near', 'as', 'known', ""'the"", 'Untold', 'Story', 'found', 'movie', 'searching', 'movies', 'similar', 'was', 'believe', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'case', 'others', 'as', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'bad', 'review', 'here', 'great', 'movie', 'almost', 'having', '2', 'more', 'hours', 'Untold', 'Story', 'watch']",N/A
893926,APIW11UEPKIC2,B0007XG4FA,"morgoth ""we lamas are traditional enemies of ...","[2, 2]","Anthony Wong plays the bigget a-hole alive.  He's a murderer, a thief, a big time sicko, and overall he is just really really mean.  The story is actually pretty good, but I'll just give a very shortened summary.  Wong gets infected with a virus called the Ebola Syndrome.  You die within 3 days after you have been infected.  But some people get infected, then they get sick, but then they recover and become virus carriers.  Wong is a carrier, and he seems to know all about this virus.  This is where the problems begin in the movie.  There are so many holes in the story that I actually found it pretty funny.  For instance, after Wong has had the virus for awhile, the director decides to have him all of a sudden start accidentaly infecting everyone he comes into contact with.  It is so exaggerated that you can't help but laugh.  And just wait until you get to the ending.  I seriously couldn't stop laughing.  Cops are running around in E.T. protection suits and shooting guns while Anthony Wong spits blood on everyone.So as long as you don't expect a great movie, just pure disgusting fun, then you should enjoy this.  There is some really sick stuff in this movie.  Gore fans should be happy.3.5/5The Universe DVD has good picture and good subtitles.  And for people looking for an uncut version, I don't know what version is best.  All I can tell you is that the Universe disc is exactly 98 minutes long.",4,Ebola!
