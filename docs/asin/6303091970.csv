Jack Lemmon arrives in Italy to get his father's corpse back to the US in time for the funeral to be viewed by 200,000 people on closed circuit TV (black and white in Puerto Rico).  The jokes reference the time (1972) as the pilot in flight tells a State Department guy, ""Greece is on the far left"" ""Not while I'm in the State Department"".  And Jack Lemmon's earily relevant gripe: ""Goddamn Ralph Nader"".But what really makes this film is Juliet Mills who just came off the show, ""Nanny and the Professor"" and proves herself here as the weight-conscious lass who wins Lemmon's heart...and ours.  It seems her mother and Lemmon's father had a 10 year affair at the hotel whose manager played by Clive Revill takes care of all the arrangements (What would Lemmon do without him).  Meanwhile the porter is trying to blackmail Lemmon with compromising photos.  Lemmon can no longer resist Mills charm.""Permesso?""

I consider myself a film buff, but I'd never heard of this film until I came across it searching for Jack Lemon movies. When I noticed that Juliet Mills costarred and read the positive reviews I had to buy it, and I'm glad I did. I've owned the movie for a month and I've watched it three times. It's surprising,not only, how quickly 140 minutes goes by, but also that, at the end of the film, I wish it would last longer. Of course, you have to like this type of film. It's a character driven piece, and that's where its humor comes from, the various eccentricities, physicalities and foibles of its characters, not from slapstick and one-liners.

355369,A132O2LX94WY9P,6303091970,Claude Lambert,"[3, 3]","What does ""Avanti!"" have in common withSabrinaandVertigo (Collector's Edition)? The three plays were written by the same author: Samuel Taylor.You might like to see this movie several times, because it plays on several levels.Level 1: A busy industrialist (Jack Lemmon) comes to Italy to bring back the body of his father to Baltimore. Once in Italy, he is confronted to an insane bureaucracy, the sudden discovery that his father was unfaithful and the attractive daughter of his father's mistress (Juliet Mills). It makes a grown-up entertainment very pleasant and beautifully photographed. The best part (the hotel manager) goes to an outstanding Clive Revill. It is light and funny without cynicism. It is what I saw the first time I watched this movie. I laughed so much I missed the other points.Level 2: Here are compared two cultures, the laid-back attitude of southern Italy in the 70s and the hyper-efficiency of the United States. Mocking gently these two cultures without being offensive is always difficult, it makes of a the movie a tour-de-force. I think it is successful because it is not judgmental.Level 3: Here you get into many small political comments. The State Department is shown a bit as it was, I think, before the fall of the Berlin wall, with a mix of arrogance and ignorance. But it is played in minor, and the first time you might not notice it. As an example, the American side criticizes the justice system in Italy, the Italian side asks about Sacco and Vanzetti. It is just 2 sentences in the film. Another sentence reminds you that Mussolini still had admirers in Italy. The touches are extremely light, they do not interfere with the main theme.Finally there is the genius of Billy Wilder. At one moment, for instance, there are 20 nuns in queue to see the movie ""Love Story"" You notice it or you don't, but the movie is more complex and rich than it appears at first sight.I think this is as good as Moliere, Bernard Shaw or Oscar Wilde.

You can enjoy this film as a thoroughly sympathetic, funny, moving romantic comedy, achieving a difficult balance of wit and sentiment.  Or you could watch it as a typically caustic Wilder satire about American hypocrisy, about learning, from Dad, how to be better at it - there are some very dark insinuations here (about American industrial practice, for a start) that cannot be overridden.Being a nice person, Wilder allows us to enjoy both.  You can throw all the flaws you like at 'Avanti' - too theatrical, too much trading in stereotypes etc. - because the good things are imperishable: extraordinary acting (especially Clive Revill as Carlucci), subtle visual patterning, unpredictable incident and funny dialogue, and a lovely, unabashedly sentimental score.

""Avanti!"" is paced leisurely which is a blessing but a little bit of a curse.  The movie is fine but the material doesn't warrant a running time of 2 hours 20 minutes.  That quibble aside I like this movie alot.  Jack Lemmon effortlessly contributes another fine performance as the industrialist who goes to Italy to claim his father's body only to find he died with his mistress in a car accident.  Juliet Mills is equally fine as the mistress' daughter.  Another quibble I had was the film portrays Mills as fat(?!) but she looked alright to me.  The blossoming romance between Lemmon and Mills is not only believable but compelling.  Clive Revill is an absolute delight as Lemmon's father's confidante.  No Oscar nom for Clive(for the movie for that matter).  Italy naturally looks great.

It combines the look and feel of a lush romantic drama of the 50's and 60's with modern, less judgemental sensibilities about sex and relationships.  It's also pretty frank in its depiction of adult behavior and the male and female form, but- again- it's all done with the kind of sweetness and kindness prevalent in earlier films covering similar romantic subject matter. Not that there isn't some biting wit throughout.""Avanti!"" is really quite unique in that regard:  You get an old-style lush Technicolor romance laced with gorgeous Italian scenery and light comedy, but without the silly production code elements that prevented the depiction of true romantic heat and adult affection; or, looked at another way, you get a frank 70's romantic drama, which matter of factly depicts nudity, sex, and other adult behavior in a non-judgemental manner (trusting audience members to make their own judgements if they care to), but one that refuses to wallow in the cynicism, coldness, and generally dismissive attitude toward traditional romance that many 70's movies embraced.Put more concisely, you get an old-movie flavor with newer-movie sensibilities, with the negative baggage of each left behind.  And it's all done in the service of two great comedic performances by Jack Lemmon and Juliet Mills; a number of cute and funny subplots set in the Italian hotel where the two leads are staying (involving several entertaining supporting characters, especially the ""man to see about anything"" hotel manager played by Clive Revill); and even a good dose of romantic suspense (we genuinely care how things will turn out for the two lovers).If, like me, you enjoy discovering terrific movies that had somehow gotten by you over the years, you're in for a treat if ""Avanti!"" crosses your path.",5,"Strangely, a great Billy Wilder comedy/drama that many film fans haven't seen",1322784000,"12 2, 2011",2011,1864,"['recent', 'discovery', 'enjoyed', 'Billy', 'Wilder', '1972', 'film', 'Avanti', 'lot', 'look', 'feel', 'lush', 'romantic', 'drama', '50', '60', 'modern', 'less', 'judgemental', 'sensibilities', 'sex', 'relationships', 'also', 'pretty', 'frank', 'depiction', 'adult', 'behavior', 'male', 'female', 'form', 'but-', 'again-', 'done', 'kind', 'sweetness', 'kindness', 'prevalent', 'earlier', 'films', 'covering', 'similar', 'romantic', 'subject', 'matter', 'Not', ""n't"", 'biting', 'wit', 'throughout.', 'Avanti', 'really', 'quite', 'unique', 'regard', 'get', 'old-style', 'lush', 'Technicolor', 'romance', 'laced', 'gorgeous', 'Italian', 'scenery', 'light', 'comedy', 'silly', 'production', 'code', 'elements', 'prevented', 'depiction', 'true', 'romantic', 'heat', 'adult', 'affection', 'looked', 'way', 'get', 'frank', '70', 'romantic', 'drama', 'matter', 'factly', 'nudity', 'sex', 'other', 'adult', 'behavior', 'non-judgemental', 'manner', 'trusting', 'audience', 'members', 'make', 'own', 'judgements', 'care', 'one', 'wallow', 'cynicism', 'coldness', 'generally', 'dismissive', 'attitude', 'traditional', 'romance', 'many', '70', 'movies', 'embraced.Put', 'more', 'concisely', 'get', 'old-movie', 'flavor', 'newer-movie', 'sensibilities', 'negative', 'baggage', 'left', 'behind', 'done', 'service', 'two', 'great', 'comedic', 'performances', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Juliet', 'Mills', 'number', 'cute', 'funny', 'subplots', 'set', 'Italian', 'hotel', 'where', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'staying', 'involving', 'several', 'entertaining', 'supporting', 'characters', 'especially', 'man', 'see', 'anything', 'hotel', 'manager', 'played', 'Clive', 'Revill', 'even', 'good', 'dose', 'romantic', 'suspense', 'genuinely', 'care', 'how', 'things', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'two', 'lovers', '.If', 'enjoy', 'discovering', 'terrific', 'movies', 'had', 'somehow', 'gotten', 'years', ""'re"", 'treat', 'Avanti', 'path']",Avanti VHS

355383,A2KSU7OOJ5C479,6303091970,"Loren D. Morrison ""amateur_reviewer""","[34, 35]","There's nothing too complicated about the plot.  A rich American businessman played by Jack Lemmon has to make a sudden trip to Italy to claim the body of his father who was killed in an auto accident.  He meets a young English woman, played by Juliet Mills, who has come to Italy to claim the body of her mother who, it turns out, died with Lemmon's father.  It seems that these two were in the midst of their annual month long tryst.  For many years they had been meeting at exactly the same date at exactly the same Italian resort for what was obviously their raison d'etre.Strait-laced Lemmon is shocked that his father could possibly behave in such a manner.  Life loving Mills is thrilled that her mother had found love and happiness.  The rest of the plot consists of the complications of dealing with Italian bureaucracy and the evolution of Lemmon's character from cold efficient American businessman to a warm loving human being.  Mills has &quot;just a bit&quot; to do with these changes in Lemmon.There was a running gag throughout the movie that exactly reflected my own experiences in Italy.  The morgue was closed until 4:00 because it was lunch time.  There were no taxis because it was lunch time.  A helicopter was told not to land at a local airport because it was lunch time.  In my own experience, when attempting to cash some travelers' checks in Rome, I was made to wait at a bank window for over 30 minutes while the cashier finished his sandwich and looked at a newspaper.  No, no other window cashed travelers' checks and yes, he'd take care of me when he was ready, but he wasn't ready yet.  I think that the feeling of &quot;been there, done that&quot; really added to my enjoyment of AVANTI, and the jokes built around the Italian inefficiencies did a lot to create the atmosphere of the whole movie.You don't have to have been there, however, to enjoy this movie.  It's warm and funny on its own.  Lemmon and Mills seem destined for one another, and the hotel manager, played by Clive Revill, who is obviously in love with love, adds another dimension of humor.  No great drama, but loving good-natured comedy is what you can expect from AVANTI.",4,SAME TIME NEXT YEAR,976406400,"12 10, 2000",2000,2175,"['nothing', 'too', 'complicated', 'plot', 'rich', 'American', 'businessman', 'played', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'make', 'sudden', 'trip', 'Italy', 'claim', 'body', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'auto', 'accident', 'young', 'English', 'woman', 'played', 'Juliet', 'Mills', 'who', 'come', 'Italy', 'claim', 'body', 'mother', 'who', 'out', 'died', 'Lemmon', 'father', 'two', 'were', 'midst', 'annual', 'month', 'long', 'tryst', 'many', 'years', 'had', 'been', 'meeting', 'exactly', 'same', 'date', 'exactly', 'same', 'Italian', 'resort', 'what', 'was', 'obviously', 'raison', ""d'etre.Strait-laced"", 'Lemmon', 'shocked', 'father', 'could', 'possibly', 'behave', 'such', 'manner', 'Life', 'loving', 'Mills', 'thrilled', 'mother', 'had', 'found', 'love', 'happiness', 'rest', 'plot', 'complications', 'dealing', 'Italian', 'bureaucracy', 'evolution', 'Lemmon', 'character', 'cold', 'efficient', 'American', 'businessman', 'warm', 'loving', 'human', 'being', 'Mills', 'quot', 'just', 'bit', 'quot', 'do', 'changes', 'Lemmon.There', 'was', 'running', 'gag', 'movie', 'exactly', 'reflected', 'own', 'experiences', 'Italy', 'morgue', 'was', 'closed', '4:00', 'was', 'lunch', 'time', 'were', 'taxis', 'was', 'lunch', 'time', 'helicopter', 'was', 'told', 'not', 'land', 'local', 'airport', 'was', 'lunch', 'time', 'own', 'experience', 'when', 'attempting', 'cash', 'travelers', 'checks', 'Rome', 'was', 'made', 'wait', 'bank', 'window', '30', 'minutes', 'cashier', 'finished', 'sandwich', 'looked', 'newspaper', 'No', 'other', 'window', 'cashed', 'travelers', 'checks', 'yes', ""'d"", 'take', 'care', 'when', 'was', 'ready', 'was', ""n't"", 'ready', 'yet', 'think', 'feeling', 'quot', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'quot', 'really', 'added', 'enjoyment', 'AVANTI', 'jokes', 'built', 'Italian', 'inefficiencies', 'did', 'lot', 'create', 'atmosphere', 'whole', 'movie.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'have', 'been', 'there', 'however', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'warm', 'funny', 'own', 'Lemmon', 'Mills', 'seem', 'destined', 'one', 'hotel', 'manager', 'played', 'Clive', 'Revill', 'who', 'obviously', 'love', 'love', 'dimension', 'humor', 'great', 'drama', 'loving', 'good-natured', 'comedy', 'what', 'can', 'expect', 'AVANTI']",Avanti VHS

355385,A129YBX5BVNW2,6303091970,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[6, 6]","When ""Avanti!"" was released in 1972, the world and its cinema had changed irrevocably. This gentle, slightly slow moving romantic-comedy about not-so-hip people had no real place in a film world gripped by gritty realism, escalating cursing and the depiction of ultra-violence. Still ""Avanti!"" (it means ""forward"") was nominated for 6 Golden Globes and won one - Best Comedy Actor for Jack Lemmon.Produced and Directed by the incomparable Billy Wilder, it featured a fabulously inventive and witty script from the dynamite duo of Wilder and his long-time writing buddy I.A.L. Diamond. Check this out. Clive Revill (Nominated as Best Comedy Supporting Actor) is in the Hotel bus on route with Lemmon from the airport telling the busy executive of Armbruster Enterprises (his father's company) that all of Italy closes for lunch between one o'clock and four o'clock in the afternoon. The incensed and jittery Wendell is agog.Jack Lemmon: ""Three hours for lunch!""Clive Revill: ""Here we take our time...we cook our pasta...we drink our wine...we make our love...""Jack Lemmon: ""What do you do in the evening?""Clive Revill: (Frowns) ""We go home to our wives!""""Avanti!"" is full of stuff like this!The story goes as so. Millionaire Wendell Armbrewster from Baltimore USA arrives in a hurry and ill-prepared in Italy to pick up the body of his father, killed in a car accident on the slopes of Naples. What he doesn't bargain for is that his bastion-of-morality father William was not alone in the car as it crashed into a vineyard. He was with his mistress Kate. In fact he'd gone to the beautiful and picturesque resort for 10 years to be with her. Both were in their late Sixties but giddily in love like kids.On route (on the plane, boat and train) Wendell keeps meeting the prim and proper Penny Pritchett (a delightful and lovely Juliet Mills) from London, England. She seems to be everywhere he goes - and when she turns up at his hotel room too - Wendell works it out - she is the daughter of Kate, his father's mistress and there to pick up her mother's body! Italian shenanigans follow one after another to stave off the funeral in Baltimore the following Tuesday - the crafty Hotel staff trying to keep the scandal at bay, the ludicrous legal paperwork, no one works the weekends, missing bodies, more triplicate paperwork, blackmailing porters and vineyard guys, swimming naked to the rock their parents used to frequent and giving the local randy fishermen an eyeful (Mills has lovely breasts which Lemmon suddenly notices). And, of course, they slowly succumb to the magic of the place and fall in love themselves.The humour is constant and the dialogue the same. For instance. Two zinc-lined coffins are needed from out of town before the bodies can be released, but the bodies get nicked by the vineyard guys who want compensation for their grapes ""poisoned by death""! Lemmon listens to Hotel Owner's crafty and constant updates on their progress with increasing American uptightness. ""Great! First we have two bodies and no coffins, now we have two coffins and no bodies!""The two leads are of course part of the secret. As the years pass, your admiration for Jack Lemmon only grows. His range, his subtlety, the way he made it look easy - you realise how truly great an actor he was. He could do witty like no-one, crazy, charming, sensitive, uptight - but all the time with that everyman humanity that Jimmy Stewart had. Juliet Mills too - lovely, sexy in her way, sweet. She has a running joke about weight all through the film which she milks with subtlety and skill and provides exactly the right kind of gentle counter that Lemmon's character needs. Throw in a cast of brilliantly funny Italian locals, romantic locations and silly set-ups and you have a fantastic Sunday afternoon warmer. The print is also in beautiful shape.This is the kind of film that makes me want to put a framed picture of Billy Wilder and his mischievious grin on the wall. And every time I pass it by, I'll look up at his beautiful lived-in face and I'll smile deep down inside. God bless you mate wherever you may be!Do yourself a favour and check out this forgotten gem - or better still - buy it and keep it for that day you need a lift.Arrivederci!

Matter of fact, so much so, that when my dad died back in 1995, I wrote Jack, and told him how many fond memories I had of us, sitting at home, or at the cinema, watching his work. Just a month later, I got a smashing, signed black & white photo, where Jack wished me all the best and thanked me for a lovely letter.Jack's The Apartment is among my top 5, desert island films. It could just as easily be this one.Avanti is one of those movies that can only be a Billy Wilder/Jack Lemmon production. Anyone else just wouldn't do. The plot is neither naff, nor ropey, and everyone does a splendid job. The vistas and views of Italy are smashing and spot on, even though the story has that stage feel to it.As is often the case with Jack Lemmons work, the humour is gut busting at times, without being forced. I can think of no other american actor with such an understaded dry wit as Jack, and that's one of the main reasons I love him. The other reason is easy to spot. He was such a loveable, everyman. Someone you would want as a friend, in part because you want to feel superior to someone, part because you want a friend you feel a need to take care of.And, aside from anything else, for those of us who love that early 1970's look to movies, this really is a treat.

I just saw this film on cable, and thoroughly enjoyed it for a variety of reasons. I give the film 4 stars because I don't think the script was Wilder/Diamond's best. Their best, of course, are among the all-time greatest movies--no need to mention names. Avanti is a cute little romantic comedy, set in gorgeous Ischia and the Amalfi Coast(my next door neighbor is from Ischia, and I called him about the film while I was watching it). It has the scenery, some fine acting by Lemmon, Juliet Mills and especially Clive Revill, an amusing story line (see other reviews), a great song (Senzo Fine), and, finally, Jack Lemmon and a chubby but shapely Juliet Mills skinny dipping in the Mediterranean in their semi-youthful prime.

Once there he comes to know about the long kept secret of his father of having a relationship with some woman. This woman's daughter Pamela Piggott (Juliet Mills) a delightful Brit also comes to Italy to pick her mother's dead body. Wendell, a hyperactive & uptight fellow and Pamela, a loving & carefree person happen to share the same hotel and share the same reason for their Italy visit. After not-so many instances, both of them find themselves in their parent's shoes. As if their assets of love have been passed on to their offspring. At the end, the bodies of the dead are not taken back to their respective country, but buried where their love once bloomed!Amidst all the tough & good times there is one character that is distinctly noticeable is of Carlo Carlucci(Clive Revill) an efficient,clever and very helpful hotel manager. He is shown to be know-it-all and handle-it-all kinda guy.One gets a sneak peek at the Italian culture of long lunch hours, mafia ruling,a general laid back attitude of people,etc..Although the movie could have done without the nude scenes and the vineyard brothers & their unreasonable demands from Wendell.The true meaning of 'Avanti' is revealed when Piggot says it in response to Wendell's asking 'Permesso?' to kiss her. This truly is a magical moment!! The lilting music, the wit of the characters played and the locales add to the magic of this enchanting experience.I'm glad that a film picked by chance turned out to be such a pleasure and it belongs to my favourite genre of movies!",4,Leisurely Romantic Comedy,1089590400,"07 12, 2004",2004,2082,"['one', 'was', 'not', 'thoughfully', 'picked', 'caught', 'eyes', 'one', 'channel', 'surfing', 'routines..', 'where', 'just', 'few', 'seconds', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'other', 'channels', 'anything', 'else..The', 'English', 'translation', 'Italian', 'word', ""'Go"", 'Ahead', 'usually', 'used', 'response', ""'Permesso"", 'asked', 'hotel', 'staff', 'knocking', 'door', 'room.Released', '1972', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'yet', 'light', 'comic', 'offering', 'where', 'American', 'businessman', 'Wendell', 'Armbruster', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Italy', 'pick', 'father', 'dead', 'body', 'Once', 'know', 'long', 'kept', 'secret', 'father', 'having', 'relationship', 'woman', 'woman', 'daughter', 'Pamela', 'Piggott', 'Juliet', 'Mills', 'delightful', 'Brit', 'also', 'Italy', 'pick', 'mother', 'dead', 'body', 'Wendell', 'hyperactive', 'uptight', 'fellow', 'Pamela', 'loving', 'carefree', 'person', 'happen', 'share', 'same', 'hotel', 'share', 'same', 'reason', 'Italy', 'visit', 'not-so', 'many', 'instances', 'find', 'parent', 'shoes', 'assets', 'love', 'have', 'been', 'passed', 'offspring', 'end', 'bodies', 'dead', 'are', 'not', 'taken', 'back', 'respective', 'country', 'buried', 'where', 'love', 'once', 'bloomed', 'Amidst', 'tough', 'good', 'times', 'one', 'character', 'distinctly', 'noticeable', 'Carlo', 'Carlucci', 'Clive', 'Revill', 'efficient', 'clever', 'very', 'helpful', 'hotel', 'manager', 'shown', 'be', 'know-it-all', 'handle-it-all', 'kinda', 'guy.One', 'sneak', 'peek', 'Italian', 'culture', 'long', 'lunch', 'hours', 'mafia', 'ruling', 'general', 'laid', 'back', 'attitude', 'people', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'nude', 'scenes', 'vineyard', 'brothers', 'unreasonable', 'demands', 'Wendell.The', 'true', 'meaning', ""'Avanti"", 'revealed', 'when', 'Piggot', 'response', 'Wendell', 'asking', ""'Permesso"", 'kiss', 'truly', 'magical', 'moment', 'lilting', 'music', 'wit', 'characters', 'played', 'locales', 'add', 'magic', 'enchanting', 'experience.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'film', 'picked', 'chance', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'such', 'pleasure', 'favourite', 'genre', 'movies']",Avanti VHS

In AVANTI! Jack Lemon plays Wendell Armbruster Jr, of Armbruster Industries who must go to Italy to retrieve his father's body in time for a big funeral back in the States but hits more than one snag in his plan because of the secret of his vacation paramour who died in the car crash with him and her daughter is there in Italy to perform the same task with her mother's body,  Englishwoman Pamela Piggot, played by Juliet Mills. Wendell's main concern is to get his father's body back home without any scandal but Pamela seems more interested in furthering a relationship with the younger Armbruster.So the story goes on to its conclusion with the uptight male trying to convince the  free thinking female to do things his way. And with the contrasting personality types exhibited by the two leads there is quite an opportunity for much humor helped along by the rather casual work methods employed by the Italian hotel employees. AVANTI! is something short of the continental romp it probably was intended to be but at 140 minutes it's still a pretty fair piece of entertainment.Misters Wilder & Diamond had been at it a long time and the age begins to show in some of the dialogue and situations in AVANTI! but it's certainly worth seeing and  enjoying at least once.I give AVANTI!
