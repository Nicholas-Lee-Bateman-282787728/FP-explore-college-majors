Unfortunately, while the movie has some intrigue and has visual appeal, it lacks the warm humor that made Nadesico the hit that it was. While there are some light-hearted moments, they seem to have been added almost as afterthoughts. This movie is decidedly darker than the original series, and some of the characters from the original show suffer quite a bit in this incarnation.In some ways, it almost appears that we were being prepared for a second series that never materialized.",4,An Unfortunate Ending,1095379200,"09 17, 2004",2004,598,"['movie', 'interesting', 'characters', 'came', 'love', 'Martian', 'Succesor', 'Nadesico', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'intrigue', 'visual', 'appeal', 'warm', 'humor', 'made', 'Nadesico', 'hit', 'was', 'are', 'light-hearted', 'moments', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'almost', 'afterthoughts', 'movie', 'decidedly', 'darker', 'original', 'series', 'characters', 'original', 'show', 'suffer', 'quite', 'bit', 'incarnation.In', 'ways', 'almost', 'were', 'being', 'prepared', 'second', 'series', 'never', 'materialized']",N/A

777207,A34JAXR0W215IP,B0000D9PNI,Das Book,"[2, 2]","There's just so much wrong with this movie that I don't know where to begin, except to say that if you watched and enjoyed the original series, you should seriously consider avoiding this movie completely, because I can more or less guarantee that you're going to be disappointed.For one thing, ""Prince of Darkness"" was written as a direct sequel to a video game that never saw release outside of Japan, ""Nadesico: The Blank of Three Years.""  As a result, anybody who never played the game--meaning bloody near everyone in the US, I'd wager--will end up watching ""Prince of Darkness"" having missed the entire middle of the story.  Why on Earth did the studio release the movie in the US, knowing full well that the vast majority of US viewers wouldn't have a prayer of following it?  I haven't the slightest idea, and since the original series stands up just fine on its own, I wish they hadn't.I could forgive that, though, if it weren't for the fact that virtually everything that made the series great has been either truncated or removed completely in the movie.  Gekigangar III, for instance, the ""meta-anime"" series, is almost completely ignored, aside from a brief shot of a Gekiganger III keychain and a line or two of dialogue.  Almost all of the series' humor has been removed, except for one or two scenes (particularly the ones involving Mizumi and Hikaru--I have to admit, I did laugh pretty hard at those).  Worst of all, though, is the characters themselves, all of whom seemed to have undergone a personality transplant.  Tenkawa Akito, the original series' protagonist and comic relief, is granted a cameo appearance in the movie, appearing as a brooding, unlikeable emo kid with a weird penchant for Green Hornet eyewear; and Hoshino Ruri, child prodigy and fan favorite from the series, is instead hideously misused in her new role as captain of the Nadesico-B and subject of a particularly insulting--both to the character and to the viewer--fanservice shot.  Misamaru Yurika's role is almost nonexistent; she spends most of the movie in a fossilized state, and if it weren't for the fact that she was such a vital part of the series, her role in the movie wouldn't be worth mentioning.To be fair, the movie's not a complete loss; there are a few honest laughs to be had, and some genuine drama, and occasionally the movie seems just on the verge of recapturing the spirit that made ""Martian Successor Nadesico"" so great in the first place.  These moments are so few and far between, though, that the movie can't help but leave a bad taste in your mouth, like a cup of your favorite coffee with a healthy dash of vinegar mixed in.  I can't in all honestly recommend this movie unless you're the kind of completist who has to have EVERYTHING, and even then, I'd highly recommend you buy a used copy.  Or just stick with the series.",2,I wish things had been different...,1186185600,"08 4, 2007",2007,2850,"['just', 'so', 'much', 'wrong', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'say', 'watched', 'enjoyed', 'original', 'series', 'should', 'seriously', 'consider', 'avoiding', 'movie', 'completely', 'can', 'more', 'less', 'guarantee', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'disappointed.For', 'one', 'thing', 'Prince', 'Darkness', 'was', 'written', 'direct', 'sequel', 'video', 'game', 'never', 'saw', 'release', 'Japan', 'Nadesico', 'Blank', 'Three', 'Years', 'result', 'anybody', 'who', 'never', 'played', 'game', 'meaning', 'bloody', 'everyone', 'US', ""'d"", 'wager', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'watching', 'Prince', 'Darkness', 'having', 'missed', 'entire', 'middle', 'story', 'Why', 'Earth', 'did', 'studio', 'release', 'movie', 'US', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'vast', 'majority', 'US', 'viewers', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'prayer', 'following', 'have', ""n't"", 'slightest', 'idea', 'original', 'series', 'up', 'just', 'fine', 'own', 'wish', ""hadn't.I"", 'could', 'forgive', 'though', 'were', ""n't"", 'fact', 'virtually', 'everything', 'made', 'series', 'great', 'been', 'either', 'truncated', 'removed', 'completely', 'movie', 'Gekigangar', 'III', 'instance', 'meta-anime', 'series', 'almost', 'completely', 'ignored', 'aside', 'brief', 'shot', 'Gekiganger', 'III', 'keychain', 'line', 'two', 'dialogue', 'Almost', 'series', 'humor', 'been', 'removed', 'one', 'two', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'ones', 'involving', 'Mizumi', 'Hikaru', 'have', 'admit', 'did', 'laugh', 'pretty', 'hard', 'Worst', 'characters', 'whom', 'seemed', 'have', 'undergone', 'personality', 'transplant', 'Tenkawa', 'Akito', 'original', 'series', 'protagonist', 'comic', 'relief', 'granted', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'movie', 'appearing', 'brooding', 'unlikeable', 'emo', 'kid', 'weird', 'penchant', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'eyewear', 'Hoshino', 'Ruri', 'child', 'prodigy', 'fan', 'favorite', 'series', 'instead', 'hideously', 'misused', 'new', 'role', 'captain', 'Nadesico-B', 'subject', 'particularly', 'insulting', 'character', 'viewer', 'fanservice', 'shot', 'Misamaru', 'Yurika', 'role', 'almost', 'nonexistent', 'most', 'movie', 'fossilized', 'state', 'were', ""n't"", 'fact', 'was', 'such', 'vital', 'part', 'series', 'role', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'worth', 'mentioning.To', 'be', 'fair', 'movie', 'not', 'complete', 'loss', 'are', 'few', 'honest', 'be', 'had', 'genuine', 'drama', 'occasionally', 'movie', 'just', 'verge', 'recapturing', 'spirit', 'made', 'Martian', 'Successor', 'Nadesico', 'so', 'great', 'first', 'place', 'moments', 'are', 'so', 'few', 'far', 'though', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'leave', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'cup', 'favorite', 'coffee', 'healthy', 'dash', 'vinegar', 'mixed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'honestly', 'recommend', 'movie', ""'re"", 'kind', 'completist', 'who', 'have', 'EVERYTHING', 'even', 'then', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'buy', 'used', 'copy', 'just', 'stick', 'series']",N/A

I knew the characters as they were in the series before seeing them in this film, and yes, I was rather thrown as well as to what the heck was going on.  The movie takes place two years or so after the series ended and a LOT has happpened and the audience is, for the most, left on its own to piece together what it's missed.  It's much darker than the series and many of the characters have changed - namely Akito.  Oh, dear Akito.  His change astounded me.  ;.;However, I loved the movie.  It just took a second viewing.  The initial viewing was basically a &quot;WTF?&quot; run-through, but I was brought back to view it again by the lovely visuals.  (Personally, I loved the music too)  Once you've seen it more than once, it has this mysterious, fantastic quality that keeps it interesting.  A lot of questions are, again, left unanswered while only a couple of those left over from the series were resolved.  There are some writing faults to it - there are too many holes.  However, I still found it enjoyable and imaginative - it leaves you to ponder what happens next.  Maybe the creators were going for the sort of thing where you just don't see the end, like Akito avoided the end of Gekiganger III/V for years.  :P  That's just a lame, fan's opinion.So, I really enjoyed it personally, despite its flaws, and I think that if a fan is willing to let go of most of the original wacky humor to see the characters go through some psychological changes (which make sense, considering the situation), it's more than worthy to own. :3",4,"So it's not what I expected, but still...",1080950400,"04 3, 2004",2004,1630,"['Let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'yes', 'have', 'seen', 'Martian', 'Successor', 'Nadesico', 'series', 'knew', 'characters', 'were', 'series', 'seeing', 'film', 'yes', 'was', 'rather', 'thrown', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'heck', 'was', 'going', 'movie', 'place', 'two', 'years', 'so', 'series', 'ended', 'LOT', 'happpened', 'audience', 'most', 'left', 'own', 'piece', 'together', 'what', 'missed', 'much', 'darker', 'series', 'many', 'characters', 'have', 'changed', 'namely', 'Akito', 'Oh', 'dear', 'Akito', 'change', 'astounded', 'However', 'loved', 'movie', 'just', 'took', 'second', 'viewing', 'initial', 'viewing', 'was', 'basically', 'quot', 'WTF', 'quot', 'run-through', 'was', 'brought', 'back', 'view', 'again', 'lovely', 'visuals', 'Personally', 'loved', 'music', 'too', 'Once', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'more', 'once', 'mysterious', 'fantastic', 'quality', 'interesting', 'lot', 'questions', 'are', 'again', 'left', 'unanswered', 'only', 'couple', 'left', 'series', 'were', 'resolved', 'are', 'writing', 'faults', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'holes', 'However', 'still', 'found', 'enjoyable', 'imaginative', 'ponder', 'what', 'next', 'Maybe', 'creators', 'were', 'going', 'sort', 'thing', 'where', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'end', 'Akito', 'avoided', 'end', 'Gekiganger', 'III/V', 'years', 'P', 'just', 'lame', 'fan', 'opinion.So', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'personally', 'flaws', 'think', 'fan', 'willing', 'let', 'go', 'most', 'original', 'wacky', 'humor', 'see', 'characters', 'go', 'psychological', 'changes', 'make', 'sense', 'considering', 'situation', 'more', 'worthy', 'own', ':3']",N/A
777209,A26O0T192IBKY1,B0000D9PNI,J. Alford,"[0, 0]","Most of the time, when a movie is a continuation of an anime TV series, its either a remake like Escaflowne, or it takes place during the show like Naruto. However, alot of times the movie will act as a conclusion for a series that has already run its course, such was the case in Evangelion and Fullmetal Alchemist. The Nadesico anime(also known as Martian Successor Nadesico)was a 26-episode TV series that was billed as being a ""space opera"", but at the same time was one of the first shows that actually riffed on anime fandom, specifically the outer space and giant robot genres. There were numerous references and jokes used throughout it which spoofed/honored the whole mecha theme in anime, even to the point where the opposing alien army had based their entire culture on a 70s super robot show. It was also a harem anime with the main antagonist had at least 2-3 girls vying for his attention, even during the middle of a space battle. So, mix Star Trek with Gundam and mix in a Love Hina sense of humor, this is what you'll get.The movie itself takes place about three years after the series ended, where fan-favorite Ruri who was an ensign when we last left her is now a full-fledged captain with her own ship, the Nadesico-B. The war between Earth and the Jovians(who're really outcasted humans from Jupiter)has ceased, and the original Nadesico-A crew has split up, most of which left the military altogether. Three of their numbers were killed though during an accident: the main character Akito, Captain Yurika, and the over-explaining Inez. It might seem a little disheartening to have some of the major characters murdered offscreen, but this comes into play later on. Ruri and her crew go to inspect the main station involved in the Hidalgo Plan which combines several warpgates using Boson Jumping linking parts of space into one big junction. The station suddenly gets taken over by a rogue new faction calling themselves the Martian Successors made up of people from the Jovian and Earth governments. They are utilizing the alien artifact found on Mars at the end of the TV series to capture the entire Boson Jump network, which is being controlled by an unconcious Yurika who is not as dead as rumored. Akito is not so dead either, and acting on his own in a dark Aestvalis mecha trying to stop the rebels. Ruri is given command of the new Nadesico-C to head to Mars and confront the Martian Successors, so she has to get the old Nadesico-A crew back to man it. Her officer Hari teleports to Mars with another A-class Boson Jumper, the also not-dead Inez, and prepare the new Nadesico for the final battle. Akito has a last duel with the commander of the Successors who caused him and Yurika to have their deaths faked in the first place, and then takes off into space leaving Yurika finally awakened by Ruri and the others. This leaves room for a sequal where Akito and Yurika are reunited, which unfortunately never happened.As a followup to the TV show, this was fairly good. Given the extensive original cast, they managed to give most of them some decent screentime, although the two main ones are either now tragically emo or unconcious for the whole movie. This was really a chance for the supporting characters to shine, especially Ruri who had been thrust into the captain's chair to make the fanboys happy. The animation took a serious upgrade from the series to the movie, mainly in the space battles and mecha fights which were downplayed quite a bit on the TV show. I'd mainly only advise this be watched by fans of the original anime, even though the ending leaves you wanting for there to be more.",3,"Viva, Geknganger!",1292284800,"12 14, 2010",2010,3635,"['Most', 'time', 'when', 'movie', 'continuation', 'anime', 'TV', 'series', 'remake', 'Escaflowne', 'place', 'show', 'Naruto', 'However', 'alot', 'times', 'movie', 'will', 'act', 'conclusion', 'series', 'already', 'run', 'course', 'such', 'was', 'case', 'Evangelion', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'Nadesico', 'anime', 'also', 'known', 'Martian', 'Successor', 'Nadesico', 'was', '26-episode', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'billed', 'being', 'space', 'opera', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'actually', 'riffed', 'anime', 'fandom', 'specifically', 'outer', 'space', 'giant', 'robot', 'genres', 'were', 'numerous', 'references', 'jokes', 'used', 'spoofed/honored', 'whole', 'mecha', 'theme', 'anime', 'even', 'point', 'where', 'opposing', 'alien', 'army', 'had', 'based', 'entire', 'culture', '70s', 'super', 'robot', 'show', 'was', 'also', 'harem', 'anime', 'main', 'antagonist', 'had', 'least', '2-3', 'girls', 'vying', 'attention', 'even', 'middle', 'space', 'battle', 'So', 'mix', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Gundam', 'mix', 'Love', 'Hina', 'sense', 'humor', 'what', ""'ll"", 'get.The', 'movie', 'place', 'three', 'years', 'series', 'ended', 'where', 'fan-favorite', 'Ruri', 'who', 'was', 'ensign', 'when', 'last', 'left', 'now', 'full-fledged', 'captain', 'own', 'ship', 'Nadesico-B', 'war', 'Earth', 'Jovians', 'who', ""'re"", 'really', 'outcasted', 'humans', 'Jupiter', 'ceased', 'original', 'Nadesico-A', 'crew', 'split', 'up', 'most', 'left', 'military', 'altogether', 'Three', 'numbers', 'were', 'killed', 'accident', 'main', 'character', 'Akito', 'Captain', 'Yurika', 'over-explaining', 'Inez', 'might', 'seem', 'little', 'disheartening', 'have', 'major', 'characters', 'murdered', 'offscreen', 'play', 'later', 'Ruri', 'crew', 'go', 'inspect', 'main', 'station', 'involved', 'Hidalgo', 'Plan', 'several', 'warpgates', 'using', 'Boson', 'Jumping', 'linking', 'parts', 'space', 'one', 'big', 'junction', 'station', 'suddenly', 'taken', 'over', 'rogue', 'new', 'faction', 'calling', 'Martian', 'Successors', 'made', 'people', 'Jovian', 'Earth', 'governments', 'are', 'utilizing', 'alien', 'artifact', 'found', 'Mars', 'end', 'TV', 'series', 'capture', 'entire', 'Boson', 'Jump', 'network', 'being', 'controlled', 'unconcious', 'Yurika', 'who', 'not', 'as', 'dead', 'rumored', 'Akito', 'not', 'so', 'dead', 'acting', 'own', 'dark', 'Aestvalis', 'mecha', 'trying', 'stop', 'rebels', 'Ruri', 'given', 'command', 'new', 'Nadesico-C', 'head', 'Mars', 'confront', 'Martian', 'Successors', 'get', 'old', 'Nadesico-A', 'crew', 'back', 'man', 'officer', 'Hari', 'Mars', 'A-class', 'Boson', 'Jumper', 'also', 'not-dead', 'Inez', 'prepare', 'new', 'Nadesico', 'final', 'battle', 'Akito', 'last', 'duel', 'commander', 'Successors', 'who', 'caused', 'Yurika', 'have', 'deaths', 'faked', 'first', 'place', 'then', 'off', 'space', 'leaving', 'Yurika', 'finally', 'awakened', 'Ruri', 'others', 'room', 'sequal', 'where', 'Akito', 'Yurika', 'are', 'reunited', 'unfortunately', 'never', 'happened.As', 'followup', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'fairly', 'good', 'Given', 'extensive', 'original', 'cast', 'managed', 'give', 'most', 'decent', 'screentime', 'two', 'main', 'ones', 'are', 'either', 'now', 'tragically', 'emo', 'unconcious', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'chance', 'supporting', 'characters', 'shine', 'especially', 'Ruri', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'thrust', 'captain', 'chair', 'make', 'fanboys', 'happy', 'animation', 'took', 'serious', 'upgrade', 'series', 'movie', 'mainly', 'space', 'battles', 'mecha', 'fights', 'were', 'downplayed', 'quite', 'bit', 'TV', 'show', ""'d"", 'mainly', 'only', 'advise', 'be', 'watched', 'fans', 'original', 'anime', 'even', 'ending', 'leaves', 'wanting', 'be', 'more']",N/A

I was sad to see it end that way, like with any other series end. I (my brother actually) recently bought the Essential Collection volumes 1 to 3 (whole series, plus cheaper but as my friend says it's like the Greatest Hits of PS2 for ADV).This movie was like they pulled out of the manga (I'm guessing) chronologically in the manga two years ahead. I was told the Japanese had the manga/novel prior to this movie, having them understand but the majority of us US mainstream fans left in the dark. I rented it, got progessively pissed off not knowing what the hell was going on. Prince of Darkness was and is like a complete stranger to me...kinda like the relationship between Yurika and Akito in begining of the series...as if we only have good memories of the series. I just felt more nostalgic and empty at the end. WHICH PROMPTED ME TO (eventually) BUY THE WHOLE SERIES instead TO GET A FIX like an otaku junkie.Friends commented it was basically for those Ruri Hoshino fans out there. The only connection I saw between the series and this motion picture is the fact that since Ruri has grown physically (she can't get more mature intellectually than she was in the series) SHE'S ALSO NOW CHASING AKITO.

Unfortunately, with my knack for getting everything backwards, it's where I began.  It took me a while to sort out my confusion about what was happening, and when I finally did I still didn't find the story all that interesting.This film comes after the original series Akito and Yurika, the original main characters, are gone and presumed dead.  In their stead, Hosino Ruri is now the captain, but for the most part the old cast is gone.  A series of Hisago Plan space colonies have come under attack and the Class A boson jumpers keep vanishing.  The solution - call in the Nadesico B.  As you might expect, nothing quite works out as planned.On top of the competition between space based and earth based forces there are third and fourth interests at work.  Once the Nadesico returns to earth after witnessing an attack the decision is made to unleash the experiment Nadesico C.  At this point the film falters while Ruri suddenly goes on a hunt for a crew that can be trusted.  And finally on to the climactic battle.While the film is nicely done, it never seems to catch fire, despite its large number of battles.  The characters don't seem to gel or develop anything beyond rudimentary relationships.  With its large number of new characters, the film even puts off those viewers who are familiar with the original story.I've survived looking at endings before beginnings before, so my over all dissatisfaction is the this film offers very little story in it's strange combination of violence and cuteness.

Originally released in Japan in 1998 after the phenomenal success of the 1996 Martian Successor Nadesico TV show. Based on the continuing events of Kia Asamiya's manga of the same name, ""The Prince of Darkness"" picks up the story several years after the events in the TV show. The movie is heavily centered around Ruri Hoshino, now the captain of the Nadesico B (and the Nadesico C later on). With revamped and enhanced character designs by Keiji Gotoh, the movie bursts onto the screen with amazing color and sound. Amazingly, even with a far much more serious tale to tell, its still told in the same jovial manner that made TV show so much fun to watch.

777213,A2Y1D9287MGNQ4,B0000D9PNI,Steven Myers,"[5, 6]","To be quite plain, whether judged as an independent movie or as the capstone of the Nadesico TV series, the Nadesico movie fails.  It fails because it is a mismash, hoping to cram in every character from the TV series without giving many of them anything to do--and worse, it feels like 30 minutes of the actual story were cut to cram more cameos in.The story takes place several years after the TV series ends, with Ruri now captain of the Nadesico B.  Akito and Yurika, the leads from the series, were lost in a shuttle accident two years before.  A new enemy has appeared, trying to wipe out the united Earth and Jovian forces.  While it's far from the world's most original story, that's not the problem.  The story is disjointed, moving in leaps and bounds.  It's as if the story were written via boson jumping (the teleport technology featured in the series and this movie), with people popping up almost randomly here and there to give speeches.  Perhaps fittingly, the ending is a nice and tidy deus ex machina, totally unexplained.So why three stars?  Despite its many faults, Ruri and Ryoko, the returning characters who get the most screen time, manage to be enjoyable (if you liked them in the series).  Since I liked those characters, several of the disjointed snippets were enjoyable, even if they didn't add up to a real movie.  Don't get this if you aren't a big Nadesico fan, and even if you are, don't get this expecting anything approaching the enjoyment you got from the series.",3,A disjointed succession of character cameos,1068336000,"11 9, 2003",2003,1498,"['be', 'quite', 'plain', 'judged', 'independent', 'movie', 'capstone', 'Nadesico', 'TV', 'series', 'Nadesico', 'movie', 'mismash', 'hoping', 'cram', 'character', 'TV', 'series', 'giving', 'many', 'anything', 'do', 'worse', '30', 'minutes', 'actual', 'story', 'were', 'cut', 'cram', 'more', 'cameos', 'in.The', 'story', 'place', 'several', 'years', 'TV', 'series', 'Ruri', 'now', 'captain', 'Nadesico', 'B.', 'Akito', 'Yurika', 'leads', 'series', 'were', 'lost', 'shuttle', 'accident', 'two', 'years', 'new', 'enemy', 'appeared', 'trying', 'wipe', 'out', 'united', 'Earth', 'Jovian', 'forces', 'far', 'world', 'most', 'original', 'story', 'not', 'problem', 'story', 'disjointed', 'moving', 'leaps', 'bounds', 'story', 'were', 'written', 'boson', 'jumping', 'teleport', 'technology', 'featured', 'series', 'movie', 'people', 'popping', 'up', 'almost', 'randomly', 'here', 'there', 'give', 'speeches', 'Perhaps', 'fittingly', 'ending', 'nice', 'tidy', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'totally', 'unexplained.So', 'why', 'three', 'stars', 'many', 'faults', 'Ruri', 'Ryoko', 'returning', 'characters', 'who', 'get', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'manage', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'liked', 'series', 'liked', 'characters', 'several', 'disjointed', 'snippets', 'were', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'real', 'movie', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'are', ""n't"", 'big', 'Nadesico', 'fan', 'even', 'are', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'expecting', 'anything', 'approaching', 'enjoyment', 'got', 'series']",N/A
