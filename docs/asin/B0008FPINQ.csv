If strange and weird Japaneses films are your delight, however, this one will definitely sate your appetite. My wife usually puts up with many of my films, especially my Japanese films, but this one was the cake for her a few years back. She actually left the room. Now, I don't blame her. Afterall, she has put up with quite a few of my Foreign films. And as the reviewer below has written: ""This film won't win any Oscars."" The director of this particular film, Shinya Tsukamoto, is also the director of the TETSUO films.Without giving away too much in the film, the main character, Hieda Reijirou (Kenji Sawada) is an archaeologist who likes inventing things from kitchen utensils. As the film begins, he has made an archaeological discovery [a mound over a school house]. The film then moves to the other characters named Takashi Yabe (Naoto Takenaka) and Tsukishima Reiko (Megumi Ueno) who are both exploring a cave when some unseen force chases after them. Apparently, a Goblin inhabits the cave, and Heida must attempt to seal off the mound before this Goblin makes people saw off their heads. It [the Goblin] has a head for a body and spider-like legs.To make a long story, of a pretty bad film short, both Heida Reijouro and Masao Yabe [the son of Takashi Yabe from the earlier cave scene] get together to try and solve this mystery. There is plenty of gushing blood and gore in the film, if these are the types of films you like. However, if you are looking for complex characters or a good plot, you will find yourself at a loss. This is not a very good film, however, I have seen worse. Recommended only if like me you love Japanese films, and refuse to take advice from friends when it comes to viewing Japanese films, and therefore must watch it yourself. I must admit however, it is a very weird and strange film. [Just don't expect too much from the film, however].",2,Not One Of Japan's Better Horror Films!,1169596800,"01 24, 2007",2007,1982,"['Hiruko', 'Goblin', 'director', 'Shinya', 'Tsukamoto', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'fact', 'pretty', 'bad', 'strange', 'weird', 'Japaneses', 'films', 'are', 'delight', 'however', 'one', 'will', 'definitely', 'sate', 'appetite', 'wife', 'usually', 'up', 'many', 'films', 'especially', 'Japanese', 'films', 'one', 'was', 'cake', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'actually', 'left', 'room', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Afterall', 'put', 'up', 'quite', 'few', 'Foreign', 'films', 'reviewer', 'below', 'written', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'Oscars', 'director', 'particular', 'film', 'Shinya', 'Tsukamoto', 'also', 'director', 'TETSUO', 'films.Without', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'Hieda', 'Reijirou', 'Kenji', 'Sawada', 'archaeologist', 'who', 'inventing', 'things', 'kitchen', 'utensils', 'film', 'made', 'archaeological', 'discovery', '[', 'mound', 'school', 'house', ']', 'film', 'then', 'other', 'characters', 'named', 'Takashi', 'Yabe', 'Naoto', 'Takenaka', 'Tsukishima', 'Reiko', 'Megumi', 'Ueno', 'who', 'are', 'exploring', 'cave', 'when', 'unseen', 'force', 'chases', 'Apparently', 'Goblin', 'cave', 'Heida', 'must', 'attempt', 'seal', 'off', 'mound', 'Goblin', 'people', 'saw', 'off', 'heads', '[', 'Goblin', ']', 'head', 'body', 'spider-like', 'legs.To', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'pretty', 'bad', 'film', 'short', 'Heida', 'Reijouro', 'Masao', 'Yabe', '[', 'son', 'Takashi', 'Yabe', 'earlier', 'cave', 'scene', ']', 'get', 'together', 'try', 'solve', 'mystery', 'plenty', 'gushing', 'blood', 'gore', 'film', 'are', 'types', 'films', 'like', 'However', 'are', 'looking', 'complex', 'characters', 'good', 'plot', 'will', 'find', 'loss', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'however', 'have', 'seen', 'worse', 'Recommended', 'only', 'love', 'Japanese', 'films', 'refuse', 'take', 'advice', 'friends', 'when', 'viewing', 'Japanese', 'films', 'therefore', 'must', 'watch', 'must', 'admit', 'however', 'very', 'weird', 'strange', 'film', '[', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'however', ']']",Hiruko the Goblin

898891,A2N36BMH61DZSM,B0008FPINQ,Jay Stone,"[0, 0]","In a filmed interview, director Shinya Tsukamoto was asked why this film was so different from his previous ones.  He stated he just wanted to make a film like some of the films he loved as a child.  This was the same stupid question most interviewers ask any creative artist:  Why did you paint, write, compose, direct, etc. a work that's different from your other works? The real answer is:  Because I wanted to!  Why would any real artist want to be strait-jacketed or pigeon-holed?I think most viewers just don't get it.  Hiruko the Goblin is not an art-house movie.  It isn't symbolic or multi-layered:  it's just a lot of fun!  The director paints a humorous, occasionally nostalgic look at early teen age life.  The youths in Hiruko are still innocent, but no longer 100% so, adults for the most part are too serious and VERY boring, and strange and mysterious things can still happen to the young.  This affectionate idealized view is paired with the appearance and bloody antics of the all-too-nasty goblin, Hiruko.  Enter the disgraced professional anthropologist who is more like a grown-up teenager than one of ""them"" (i.e., boring adults), and the adventure begins:  Hiruko must be stopped!Another criticism leveled against this movie is the ""low budget"" special effects.  Guess what, folks? This is a horror comedy about young people (and the young at heart).  Do you remember what is was like watching cheesy horror movies that scared the crap out of you when you were young, but seem laughable when you view them now?  Well the horror effects in Hiruko are far better than most of those, but still imbued with affection and just enough cheesiness to satisfy the whole tone of the movie.  I think the actors do a great job as well.In my view, the only other movie that bears comparison to Hiruko the Goblin is Re-animator.  Both have an unbelievable, outrageous sense of humor, although Re-animator certainly isn't nostalgic.  With both films, you just have to let go and let the movie entertain you - and it will.Enjoy!",4,"Take A Deep Breath, Exhale, Relax, Watch and Enjoy!",1381795200,"10 15, 2013",2013,2035,"['filmed', 'interview', 'director', 'Shinya', 'Tsukamoto', 'was', 'asked', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'different', 'previous', 'ones', 'stated', 'just', 'wanted', 'make', 'film', 'films', 'loved', 'child', 'was', 'same', 'stupid', 'question', 'most', 'interviewers', 'ask', 'creative', 'artist', 'Why', 'did', 'paint', 'write', 'compose', 'direct', 'etc', 'work', 'different', 'other', 'works', 'real', 'answer', 'wanted', 'Why', 'would', 'real', 'artist', 'want', 'be', 'strait-jacketed', 'pigeon-holed', 'think', 'most', 'viewers', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Goblin', 'not', 'art-house', 'movie', ""n't"", 'symbolic', 'multi-layered', 'just', 'lot', 'fun', 'director', 'humorous', 'occasionally', 'nostalgic', 'look', 'early', 'teen', 'age', 'life', 'youths', 'Hiruko', 'are', 'still', 'innocent', 'no', 'longer', '100', '%', 'so', 'adults', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'too', 'serious', 'VERY', 'boring', 'strange', 'mysterious', 'things', 'can', 'still', 'happen', 'young', 'affectionate', 'idealized', 'view', 'paired', 'appearance', 'bloody', 'antics', 'all-too-nasty', 'goblin', 'Hiruko', 'Enter', 'disgraced', 'professional', 'anthropologist', 'who', 'more', 'grown-up', 'teenager', 'one', 'i.e.', 'boring', 'adults', 'adventure', 'Hiruko', 'must', 'be', 'stopped', 'criticism', 'leveled', 'movie', 'low', 'budget', 'special', 'effects', 'Guess', 'what', 'folks', 'horror', 'comedy', 'young', 'people', 'young', 'heart', 'Do', 'remember', 'what', 'was', 'watching', 'cheesy', 'horror', 'movies', 'scared', 'crap', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'seem', 'laughable', 'when', 'view', 'now', 'Well', 'horror', 'effects', 'Hiruko', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'most', 'still', 'imbued', 'affection', 'just', 'enough', 'cheesiness', 'satisfy', 'whole', 'tone', 'movie', 'think', 'actors', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'well.In', 'view', 'only', 'other', 'movie', 'comparison', 'Hiruko', 'Goblin', 'Re-animator', 'Both', 'have', 'unbelievable', 'outrageous', 'sense', 'humor', 'Re-animator', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'nostalgic', 'films', 'just', 'have', 'let', 'go', 'let', 'movie', 'entertain']",Hiruko the Goblin

898893,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0008FPINQ,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[6, 6]","Hiruko the Goblin (Shinya Tsukamoto, 1991)Sometimes it seems like every Shinya Tsukamoto fan on the planet hates Hiruko the Goblin. Now that I've actually seen it, I'm not entirely sure why. I get it in context-- Hiruko, Tsukamoto's second film, was nothing at all like his first, Tetsuo: The Iron Man-- but now that we have sixteen years of hindsight and know that it was Tetsuo and not Hiruko that was the odd man out, perhaps it's time for some of the movie's harsher critics to revisit it. It's silly, and it's dumb, but it's quite funny and not nearly as awful as I'd been led to believe.The story concerns a school that was built atop a burial mound containing a trapped goblin named Hiruko. An archaeological expedition unwittingly frees Hiruko, who gets up to his old tricks again pronto. (These tricks consist of things like beheading people and possessing attractive young women.) A goblin-hunter shows up and works with the son of one of the folks who's disappeared to try and figure out what's going on.Hiruko was made with a slightly larger budget than Tetsuo, but it's still pretty obvious Tsukamoto was working in the basement for this one. To me, that just adds to its charm; this isn't a lavish production like Tsukamoto's more recent films, so you get cheap special effects and an amateurish patina over everything. But to balance it out, the film is earnest without ever taking itself at all seriously; every time it has a chance to go for the laugh, it does. (Note that the American equivalent would not be an Adam Sandler or Chris Farley movie; early-period Peter Jackson is a bit closer to the mark.)A very fun and unjustly neglected movie. Well worth checking out. ***",3,Seems I liked it better than most.,1206403200,"03 25, 2008",2008,1691,"['Hiruko', 'Goblin', 'Shinya', 'Tsukamoto', '1991', 'Shinya', 'Tsukamoto', 'fan', 'planet', 'Hiruko', 'Goblin', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'seen', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'why', 'get', 'context', 'Hiruko', 'Tsukamoto', 'second', 'film', 'was', 'nothing', 'first', 'Tetsuo', 'Iron', 'Man', 'now', 'have', 'sixteen', 'years', 'hindsight', 'know', 'was', 'Tetsuo', 'not', 'Hiruko', 'was', 'odd', 'man', 'perhaps', 'time', 'movie', 'harsher', 'critics', 'revisit', 'silly', 'dumb', 'quite', 'funny', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'awful', ""'d"", 'been', 'led', 'believe.The', 'story', 'concerns', 'school', 'was', 'built', 'burial', 'mound', 'containing', 'trapped', 'goblin', 'named', 'Hiruko', 'archaeological', 'expedition', 'unwittingly', 'Hiruko', 'who', 'up', 'old', 'tricks', 'again', 'pronto', 'tricks', 'consist', 'things', 'beheading', 'people', 'possessing', 'attractive', 'young', 'women', 'goblin-hunter', 'up', 'son', 'one', 'folks', 'who', 'disappeared', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'on.Hiruko', 'was', 'made', 'slightly', 'larger', 'budget', 'Tetsuo', 'still', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'Tsukamoto', 'was', 'working', 'basement', 'one', 'just', 'charm', ""n't"", 'lavish', 'production', 'Tsukamoto', 'more', 'recent', 'films', 'get', 'cheap', 'special', 'effects', 'amateurish', 'patina', 'everything', 'balance', 'out', 'film', 'earnest', 'ever', 'taking', 'seriously', 'time', 'chance', 'go', 'laugh', 'Note', 'American', 'equivalent', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'movie', 'early-period', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'bit', 'closer', 'mark', 'very', 'fun', 'unjustly', 'neglected', 'movie', 'Well', 'checking', 'out', '***']",Hiruko the Goblin
