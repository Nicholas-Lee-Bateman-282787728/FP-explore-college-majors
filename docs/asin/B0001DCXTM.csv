Our ten year old is already using the adult yoga dvds, having outgrown children's yoga videos.  This is a wonderful dvd to add to your collection and the instructor is really good.  I agree with the other reviewer who said she doesn't talk down to the children...this is important.  I once had to get rid of a kids exercise video because our daughter felt insulted by the instructor!Also, I feel it is important to note that WE also are a Christian family, and find no offense with the use of OM and NAMASTE at all.  This video certainly isn't out to convert anyone to Hinduism!  There is nothing at all wrong with having children learn the value of quiet relaxation, no matter what your religious convictions.  Some of the content found in today's supposedly Christian dvds and stories is far more offensive.  Give this one a try.

This video is a bit to Eastern for my taste with my three year old.However, that's not my biggest complaint.  It's stupid. Boring.  And doesn't come close to resembling anything similar to yoga.  There's far too much ""junk"" in between segments, and I understand you have to keep segments short to keep kids interested, but the segments in between poses either get the child totally distracted or totally bored, and she then doesn't want to do the next pose.My daughter hated it.

So happy I stumbled upon this dvd! It is great and keeps his attention (which is rare for him) and gets his crazy toddler energy out. There are a few moves he can't do just yet, but for the most part it is fairly easy for him to follow.
