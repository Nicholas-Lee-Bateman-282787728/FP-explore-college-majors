748447,AUHG8KSHI529U,B00008WJBG,Craig Matteson,"[41, 46]","There is a group of people who love to feel superior by disdaining things that everyday people enjoy.  One of those things is a John Wayne movie.  I am one who really enjoys John Wayne movies.  He had a great screen presence, even when he was older, as he was here, in the Rooster Cogburn movies, and especially in the great movie ""The Shootist"".This movie is really about fathers and sons, and particularly absent fathers and sons who find the wrong path and try to get back to the right way.  Wayne plays the title character, J. D. Cahill.  The opening scene is him on the road taking on a band of five bad guys in a shootout that ends the way you would expect the hero to play in a John Wayne film.Cahill is an older man and we learn that he has young sons, one, Danny, a young teen and the other, Budger, a young boy.  Their mother died.  In a touching conversation with Danny, regretting his not being around for them, he acknowledges that he has focused too much on his job.  He does note that when Danny's mother (Cahill's dear wife) was dying her last words to Cahill were, ""Go Get `Em!"".  And so, he has been ever since.George Kennedy plays one of his best and menacing bad guys, Abe Fraser.  I don't want to get into the plot, but he does suck Danny and Budger into his plans.  And it is the boys trying to extricate themselves without letting their father in on their problems that ends up causing most of the problems.  The crisis comes when some innocent men are facing death for the crimes the boys know they and Abe's gang committed and they have to get things right in time.You expect things to turn out a certain way in a film like this.  There aren't any big surprises, but there are some funny and some touching moments along the way.  And Wayne is still quite good as he holds the screen with his unique presence.  And Neville Brand as Lightfoot provides some very fine moments in the film.I don't think it is one of the best things Wayne did, but it is still better then most films and suitable for families.  It can provide some good discussion with your kids, as well.And it is a John Wayne film.",5,A pretty darn good late John Wayne film,1139875200,"02 14, 2006",2006,2119,"['group', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'feel', 'superior', 'disdaining', 'things', 'everyday', 'people', 'enjoy', 'One', 'things', 'John', 'Wayne', 'movie', 'am', 'one', 'who', 'really', 'John', 'Wayne', 'movies', 'had', 'great', 'screen', 'presence', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'older', 'was', 'here', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'movies', 'especially', 'great', 'movie', 'Shootist', '.This', 'movie', 'really', 'fathers', 'sons', 'particularly', 'absent', 'fathers', 'sons', 'who', 'find', 'wrong', 'path', 'try', 'get', 'back', 'right', 'way', 'Wayne', 'title', 'character', 'J.', 'D.', 'Cahill', 'opening', 'scene', 'road', 'taking', 'band', 'five', 'bad', 'guys', 'shootout', 'way', 'would', 'expect', 'hero', 'play', 'John', 'Wayne', 'film.Cahill', 'older', 'man', 'learn', 'young', 'sons', 'one', 'Danny', 'young', 'teen', 'other', 'Budger', 'young', 'boy', 'mother', 'died', 'touching', 'conversation', 'Danny', 'regretting', 'not', 'being', 'focused', 'too', 'much', 'job', 'note', 'when', 'Danny', 'mother', 'Cahill', 'dear', 'wife', 'was', 'dying', 'last', 'words', 'Cahill', 'were', 'Go', 'Get', 'Em', 'so', 'been', 'ever', 'since.George', 'Kennedy', 'one', 'best', 'menacing', 'bad', 'guys', 'Abe', 'Fraser', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'plot', 'suck', 'Danny', 'Budger', 'plans', 'boys', 'trying', 'extricate', 'letting', 'father', 'problems', 'up', 'causing', 'most', 'problems', 'crisis', 'when', 'innocent', 'men', 'are', 'facing', 'death', 'crimes', 'boys', 'know', 'Abe', 'gang', 'committed', 'have', 'get', 'things', 'right', 'time.You', 'expect', 'things', 'turn', 'out', 'certain', 'way', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'big', 'surprises', 'are', 'funny', 'touching', 'moments', 'way', 'Wayne', 'still', 'quite', 'good', 'screen', 'unique', 'presence', 'Neville', 'Brand', 'Lightfoot', 'very', 'fine', 'moments', 'film.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'Wayne', 'did', 'still', 'better', 'then', 'most', 'films', 'suitable', 'families', 'can', 'provide', 'good', 'discussion', 'kids', 'well.And', 'John', 'Wayne', 'film']",N/A

It succeeds on a few levels, but fails on so many others that makes it nowhere near one of the best films of John Wayne. The script is a horror to behold (such a pity too, because the writer for this was also the writer for ""BIG JAKE"", one of the Duke's better outings), the action is near perfect, the performances are great. The main plot is of U.S. Marshal J.D. Cahill (John Wayne) trying to get his sons out of a gang of outlaws alive. His oldest son Daniel (Gary Grimes) being in an outlaw gang is believable, because he is very rebellious. But not his youngest son Billy Joe (Clay O'Brien). Billy Joe is basically a good kid who loves his pa. The audience assumes that Billy Joe threw in with the outlaws because he followed his brother, but the film never shows or says that. Not to mention that the sight of little O'Brien holding that shotgun that is bigger than he is not at all convincing. However, films that have the ""unbelievability factor"" are usually appealing to me. But those films know they are unbelievable and just move along with an amazing pace - that's why they are so enjoyable. Not this movie. It is unbelievable, but it never decides if it knows that or not. It just seems to stay in the same gear the whole time and as a result, is bogged down in mediocrity the entire film. There is no bad acting, just bad acting choices. The film casts several veterans of movies and television, such as Jackie Coogan, Harry Carey Jr., Marie Windsor, Royal Dano, Denver Pyle, and Paul Fix, but the script unfortunately only gives them unimportant roles. Their acting is not at all bad, but the characters are unnecessary. It looks like the director cast these roles based on their talent, not on their significance to the script. On the positive side, the other actors are great in their roles, like George Kennedy as Fraser. Also, the action scenes are almost perfect, and the script seems to pick up the slightest bit in the last half hour. Overall, a fair movie, but if it was not for The Duke, it would have been a complete disaster.SPECIAL FEATURESFeature-length audio commentary by Director Andrew V.

But in a youthful, rebellious spirit, his boys throw their lot in with some real outlaws. And it spells trouble. Big trouble.

In Cahill, United States Marshal he plays a lawman hunting a bad-guy army of bank robbers.  What makes this a somewhat unusual western tale is that J.D. Cahill is a widower raising two sons, both of which are also suspects in  a bank robbery and two killings.Even though I did not like this John Wayne western as much as others I have seen; nevertheless, the story moves along at a good  pace.  There is also some drama and conflict in this film.  There is plenty of action as Cahill attempts to balance being a father of two boys while rounding up the bad guys at the same time.In conclusion, this is a film that lovers of John Wayne westerns may want to check out.Rating:  4 Stars.

748474,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00008WJBG,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[9, 13]","The tagline for the 1973 western &quot;Cahill U.S. Marshal&quot; declares: &quot;Break the law and he's the last man you want to see. And the last you ever will.&quot;  But we know that because the title character is played by John Wayne, so it really goes without saying that he is as good as it gets.  But this is the Duke near the end of his career and while he made a pretty good western the year before with &quot;The Cowboys,&quot; he was now just coasting (e.g., &quot;The Train Robbers,&quot; &quot;Brannigan&quot;) before he actually had some fun making a movie with Katharine Hepburn (&quot;Rooster Cogburn&quot;) and found an excellent coda to his legendary acting career with &quot;The Shootist.&quot;Wayne is J.D. Cahill, a tough U.S. marshal who is always on the trail of someone and never at home, which is why his sons Danny (Gary Grimes) and Billy Joe (Clay O'Brien) decide to teach the old man a lesson they go off with Abe Fraser (George Kennedy) and his gang to rob a bank.  Actually they have a fairly complicated plan which involves being locked up in jail during the robbery so they have an alibi.  Fraser promises no one will get hurt, but of course the sheriff and deputy are gunned down.  The younger Cahill hides the loot and if either brother talks, Fraser will kill them both.  With the sheriff dead, daddy shows up to track down the bank robbers and takes Danny along with him.  They even capture a group of outlaws, who are sentenced to hang for the murders and the robbery.The pivotal character in the film is actual Danny Cahill, who has to get the hidden loot to Fraser, avoid having four innocent men hung, and try and pray that his father never gets everything to add up.  Of course he does, although how the dots get connected is not exactly clear.  There was an opportunity for a really good scene here at the big moment, but it just is not there and then Wayne's efforts to make the best of a bad situation kind of gets lost in the film's end game.  Basically whatever you think Cahill should do in that situation, he is not going to make you happy, which ever of the two opposing approaches you want him to take.&quot;Cahill United States Marshall&quot; has an above average number of old familiar faces in supporting roles with Denver Pyle as the boy's caretaker, Royal Dano as a hermit, Jackie Coogan as Charlie the town drunk, and Harry Carey, Jr. as Hank the jailer.  Neville Brand has a nice turn as Lightfoot, a half Comanche tracker, but Kennedy is not that memorable as a villain, which is rather surprising.  Wayne has more than his fair share of bad lines in this one (e.g., &quot;If a buzzard bites you, he'd never eat meat again&quot;), and the fault here has to be with the script that sets up a fairly interesting situation and then really does not know what to do with it, which is why this becomes a pedestrian John Wayne film.",3,An interesting idea for a western that does not pan out,1090022400,"07 17, 2004",2004,2883,"['tagline', '1973', 'western', 'quot', 'Cahill', 'U.S.', 'Marshal', 'quot', 'declares', 'quot', 'Break', 'law', 'last', 'man', 'want', 'see', 'last', 'ever', 'will.', 'quot', 'know', 'title', 'character', 'played', 'John', 'Wayne', 'really', 'saying', 'as', 'good', 'Duke', 'end', 'career', 'made', 'pretty', 'good', 'year', 'quot', 'Cowboys', 'quot', 'was', 'now', 'just', 'coasting', 'e.g.', 'quot', 'Train', 'Robbers', 'quot', 'quot', 'Brannigan', 'quot', 'actually', 'had', 'fun', 'making', 'movie', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'quot', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'quot', 'found', 'excellent', 'coda', 'legendary', 'acting', 'career', 'quot', 'Shootist.', 'quot', 'Wayne', 'J.D', 'Cahill', 'tough', 'U.S.', 'marshal', 'who', 'always', 'trail', 'someone', 'never', 'home', 'why', 'sons', 'Danny', 'Gary', 'Grimes', 'Billy', 'Joe', 'Clay', ""O'Brien"", 'decide', 'teach', 'old', 'man', 'lesson', 'go', 'off', 'Abe', 'Fraser', 'George', 'Kennedy', 'gang', 'rob', 'bank', 'Actually', 'have', 'fairly', 'complicated', 'plan', 'being', 'locked', 'up', 'jail', 'robbery', 'have', 'alibi', 'Fraser', 'one', 'will', 'get', 'hurt', 'course', 'sheriff', 'deputy', 'are', 'gunned', 'down', 'younger', 'Cahill', 'loot', 'brother', 'talks', 'Fraser', 'will', 'kill', 'sheriff', 'dead', 'daddy', 'up', 'track', 'down', 'bank', 'robbers', 'Danny', 'even', 'capture', 'group', 'outlaws', 'who', 'are', 'sentenced', 'hang', 'murders', 'robbery.The', 'pivotal', 'character', 'film', 'actual', 'Danny', 'Cahill', 'who', 'get', 'hidden', 'loot', 'Fraser', 'avoid', 'having', 'four', 'innocent', 'men', 'hung', 'try', 'pray', 'father', 'never', 'everything', 'add', 'up', 'course', 'how', 'dots', 'get', 'connected', 'not', 'exactly', 'clear', 'was', 'opportunity', 'really', 'good', 'scene', 'here', 'big', 'moment', 'just', 'not', 'there', 'then', 'Wayne', 'efforts', 'make', 'best', 'bad', 'situation', 'kind', 'lost', 'film', 'end', 'game', 'Basically', 'think', 'Cahill', 'should', 'do', 'situation', 'not', 'going', 'make', 'happy', 'ever', 'two', 'opposing', 'approaches', 'want', 'take.', 'quot', 'Cahill', 'United', 'States', 'Marshall', 'quot', 'above', 'average', 'number', 'old', 'familiar', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Denver', 'Pyle', 'boy', 'caretaker', 'Royal', 'Dano', 'hermit', 'Jackie', 'Coogan', 'Charlie', 'town', 'drunk', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'Jr.', 'Hank', 'jailer', 'Neville', 'Brand', 'nice', 'turn', 'Lightfoot', 'half', 'Comanche', 'tracker', 'Kennedy', 'not', 'that', 'memorable', 'villain', 'rather', 'surprising', 'Wayne', 'more', 'fair', 'share', 'bad', 'lines', 'one', 'e.g.', 'quot', 'buzzard', ""'d"", 'never', 'eat', 'meat', 'again', 'quot', 'fault', 'here', 'be', 'script', 'up', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'situation', 'then', 'really', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'why', 'pedestrian', 'John', 'Wayne', 'film']",N/A

Below, more of my impressions with some limited SPOILERS.Made in 1973 ""Cahill, US Marshal"" is one of the last films in John Wayne's career. He was going to make only four films after this one: two crime movies, ""McQ"" in 1974 and ""Brannigan"" in 1975, before going back to westerns and turning ""Rooster Cogburn... and the Lady"" (a quite honest sequel to the legendary ""True Grit"") in 1975 and his great finale and last hurrah, ""The shootist"" in 1976.J.D. Cahill is the toughest US Marshal in history (OK, maybe after Rooster Cogburn). Once he catches a trail and smells blood, there is no escape - he always brings in his man, either vertically or horizontally positioned... And he certainly produces many memorable one liners, like the one in the title of this review...)))But his job didn't allow him much time to take care of his sons, Danny and Billy Joe, even after his wife died. The boys miss him greatly and terribly resent his absences - and therefore they will be an easy prey for a bad man willing to use them for his own sinister purposes. Nothing more will be said about the story.It pains me to say that, but this is not a very good film. Oh for sure it is a honest watch, with some humour, many very ""macho"" moments, some good shootouts and a nice soundtrack - but a masterpiece it isn't. In fact, in many moments it seems like this film was somehow made more for young adults and/or teenagers rather than for grown ups. The best secondary character, a half-breed Comanche called Lightfoot (Neville Brand) is not really optimally used, the ""bad guy"" character and his henchmen are ultimately not very well conceived and the ending is not as good as should be.Therefore I recommend this film mostly for Duke's true blue fans, like me - for our kind this is still a very watchable thing.

He would not make many more films after this. Of the 69 Westerns he eventually made, this is not one of his better ones, but it is still very good and I'd certainly put it in the top half. This film is part tongue-in-cheek Western comedy and part serious horse opera. There are plenty of gunfights and other action, but also plenty of comic relief. Wayne plays a U.S. Marshal in a style reminiscent of the Marshal Rooster Cogburn persona in &#34;True Grit&#34; and &#34;Rooster Cogburn (and the Lady)&#34;. Although he was always an imposing film presence and played himself most of the time, he was no slouch as an actor and could play serious drama and comedy equally well. He had perfect comic timing and you see it on display in this film, especially in his repartees w/Neville Brand. In addition to Wayne and Brand, the support acting is quite good too. If you've watched many of Wayne's Westerns, you will note and identify many of the stock character actors than appeared in many of his films...Harry Carey, Jr., Hank Worden, Royal Dano, Denver Pyle; etc. The two young actors who play Cahill's sons (Gary Grimes and Clay O'Brien) also do quite well. If you're a fan of Wayne's and/or frontier Westerns, this is one you'll want to see.

748502,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,B00008WJBG,T O'Brien,"[1, 3]","Late in his career, John Wayne did a handful of westerns that while not classics, were and are always reliable entertainment for his fans.  Cahill US Marshal is one of those westerns, almost like comfort food in movie form.  JD Cahill is a tough as nails US Marshal who always get his prey and isn't afraid to go up against a gang all by himself. But returning home after a long time on the trail, Cahill finds out the local bank has been robbed, but there's no tracks anywhere in or out of the town that the robbers left.  As he begins to investigate, Cahill begins to wonder exactly what's going on and who's involved.  At the same time, the Marshal is trying to reconnect with his sons who since his wife died have almost raised themselves.  Nothing too different here, but it's a quality western with some good action and beautiful locations around Durango.  The town location from The Train Robbers has been expanded to a much bigger town.  All in all, a worthwhile pick for John Wayne fans and westerns in general.The Duke stars as U.S. Marshal J.D. Cahill, the peace officer trying to right a wrong with his sons while also bringing a gang of four bank robbers to justice.  John Wayne late in his career was still a great presence, and his role here as a bigger than life US Marshal doesn't disappoint.  Gary Grimes is good as Cahill's 17-year old son, Danny, who angry at his father for not being around gets caught up in the wrong crowd, bringing his 13-year old brother, Billy Joe (Clay O'Brien), into the mix as well. Neville Brand has some good moments as Lightfoot, a half-breed Comanche who tracks for Cahill and serves as a sidekick of sorts.  George Kennedy may be remembered as a great character actor who played sidekicks and supporting roles, but he's very good here as the villian, Fraser, the gang leader who knocks off the bank with some special help.  Morgan Paull as Struther and Dan Vadis as Brownie are members of the gang.  With a Wayne western, there's got to be some stock company appearances and there's a plenty, including Paul Fix, Harry Carey JR, Royal Dano, Denver Pyle, Hank Worden, and Chuck Roberson to round out the cast.Along with a very nice looking widescreen presentation, the DVD offers some pretty cool features, including a director commentary from Andrew V. McLaglen, a director who worked with Wayne many times in the actor's later years.  Also added on is an 8-minute featurette, The Man Behind the Star, about peace officers in the west and how the movie portrays them, a trailer, some cast and crew info, and a little recap of Wayne's later westerns.  So overall, this isn't a classic western like The Searchers or Liberty Valance, but Cahill US Marshal is an enjoyable western from Duke's later years that fans will like.
