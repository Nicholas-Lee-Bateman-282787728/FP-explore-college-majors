654905,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00005JPOE,Alfred Johnson,"[10, 10]","Amazing graceA movie about the ending of the slave trade and the eventual ending of slavery in Britain is a worthy subject in this year of the celebration of the 200th anniversary of its abolition. One should note that this was done, unlike in the United States, by mainly democratic means rather than civil war. Would that all our victories could be won in such a manner but history is replete with many more examples of the necessity for bloody social struggles, win or lose.The core of this film is however a little disquieting as to its fidelity to historic facts or at least the way they are presented on the screen. In my youth I believed that Wilberforce's parliamentary fight was the key to abolition. While it is impossible to ignore his contribution to the struggle against slavery time and more study have revealed many other factors, not the least the push from below by the working class and other oppressed strata of British society, in contributing to that result. Based solely on the film one would never get the impression that those efforts from below counted and once again we are treated to that timeworn premise that the `great man' was decisive.Commercial films are not obliged by their nature to be paragons of historical correctness. An informative article in a recent New York Review of Books (June 14, 2007) discusses in greater detail the historical problems than I wish to do here.  While I encourage everyone to see this film (if for not other reason that the magnificent perform by Albert Finney) one should use that as a starting point to investigate the other details about this great struggle to end a heinous crime against blacks and against humanity.",4,"The fight against slavery, up close",1192492800,"10 16, 2007",2007,1685,"['Amazing', 'graceA', 'movie', 'ending', 'slave', 'trade', 'eventual', 'ending', 'slavery', 'Britain', 'worthy', 'subject', 'year', 'celebration', '200th', 'anniversary', 'abolition', 'One', 'should', 'note', 'was', 'done', 'United', 'States', 'mainly', 'democratic', 'means', 'rather', 'civil', 'war', 'Would', 'victories', 'could', 'be', 'won', 'such', 'manner', 'history', 'replete', 'many', 'more', 'examples', 'necessity', 'bloody', 'social', 'struggles', 'win', 'lose.The', 'core', 'film', 'however', 'little', 'disquieting', 'fidelity', 'historic', 'facts', 'least', 'way', 'are', 'presented', 'screen', 'youth', 'believed', 'Wilberforce', 'parliamentary', 'fight', 'was', 'key', 'abolition', 'impossible', 'ignore', 'contribution', 'struggle', 'slavery', 'time', 'more', 'study', 'have', 'revealed', 'many', 'other', 'factors', 'not', 'least', 'push', 'working', 'class', 'other', 'oppressed', 'strata', 'British', 'society', 'contributing', 'result', 'Based', 'solely', 'film', 'one', 'would', 'never', 'get', 'impression', 'efforts', 'counted', 'once', 'again', 'are', 'treated', 'timeworn', 'premise', 'great', 'man', 'was', 'decisive.Commercial', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'obliged', 'nature', 'be', 'paragons', 'historical', 'correctness', 'informative', 'article', 'recent', 'New', 'York', 'Review', 'Books', 'June', '14', '2007', 'greater', 'detail', 'historical', 'problems', 'wish', 'do', 'here', 'encourage', 'everyone', 'see', 'film', 'not', 'other', 'reason', 'magnificent', 'perform', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'one', 'should', 'use', 'starting', 'point', 'investigate', 'other', 'details', 'great', 'struggle', 'end', 'heinous', 'crime', 'blacks', 'humanity']",Amazing Grace [Theatrical Release]

It's about human decency. Young William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) was a student of John Newton (played by Albert Finney), who wrote ""Amazing Grace"" after having been a slave ship captain, and estimated that he had the ghosts of 20,000 slaves to keep him company. Wilberforce was also close friends with William Pitt (Benedict Cumberbatch) long before he became prime minister.This is basically the story of the fight to abolish the slave trade in Great Britain, but the relationship to the American trade is tied into it. Wilberforce just kept pounding away at the Parliament until they gave in, but of course the story is far more complicated than that. He used a variety of tactics to bring home the issue of the cruelty of slavery, including inviting a group of MPs and their wives to an outing on board a boat in the harbor which stopped beside a slave ship where they could smell the stench of blood, sickness and death.Barbara Spooner (Romola Garai) was a beautiful abolitionist whom Mr. and Mrs. Pitt tried to set up with Wilberforce, which of course made them both a bit put off. However, years later they did marry. (Oh, dear, am I giving too much away here?)Two faces in this movie, and especially the two voices, may seem very familiar, although I had to look them up on Wikipedia to be sure I was right.

654922,A25HYPL2XKQPZB,B00005JPOE,Bill Garrison,"[4, 4]","AMAZING GRACE is a historical film about William Wilburforce, a member of the British House of Commons, that leads the fight to eliminate the slave trade in the British Empire. Wilburforce is an amazing person and this film really doesn't do his life's work justice. But it does tell a good story and is a good starting point if you want to learn more about Wilburforce and the era in which he lived. At a young age, Wilburforce has a religious conversion and became an evangalical Christian. He felt called to serve God, and others convinced him that he could serve God by pushing for change in Parliment. A group of men, including ministers and an ex-slave met with Wilburforce and convinced him to take up their cause in Parliment to abolish the slave trade in the British Empire.Wilburforce faces an uphill battle because the economy of Britian is very dependent on the slave trade. He tries to gather evidence to support his cause while speaking to the House of Commons. He has chains, drawings of slave ships, eyewitness accounts and replicas of sleeping quarters. While all of this evidence is very persuasive to characters in the movie, I found it very uninspiring to me. I realize director Michael Apted's goal in the film was to make a movie about the legislative battles it took to abolish the slave trade (actual slavery was already illegal in England). The movie has very few black characters. I realize the horror of the slave trade could not be captured in such a brief moment in this film, but after hearing the descriptions of the way the slaves were treated and seeing a few reenactments of their treatment, I believe a few scenes depicting the horror of life on a slave ship would have been very effective and showing why Wilburforce was so motivated to abolish the slave trade.This movie had a top notch cast, great acting, and was very intellectually stimulating. Yet it failed to capture my heart. The flashback mode of storytelling seemed confusing and unneccessary, and as mentioned earlier, I never felt the true horror and suffering of the cause Wilburforce sacrificed so much of his life for. If anything, this is a movie to watch if you're interested in slavery and William Wilburforce. There is nothing too offensive in the movie, yet children would probably be bored to tears.  This is a movie that does a great job telling the story of how the slave trade was abolished in the British Empire. If you're looking for a movie about slavery and its affect on millions of Africans, you won't find it here.

If you watch this expecting a movie about a Christian and how his faith informs and directs his life and his work, you'll probably be greatly encouraged.Amazing Grace tells the story of William Wilberforce, a member of the British parliament in the late 18th and early 19th century, who worked to abolish Britain's involvement in the slave trade. Wilberforce's co-MPs posed quite the opposition, both because of prejudices and economic factors (the livelihood of many who voted them into office depended on the slave trade).Although strongly interested in abolition early in his career, he began to wonder if a newly redisovered faith demanded that he abandon politics and dedicate himself full-time to ""the Lord's work"". He consulted with many -- even John Newton, a former slave ship captain and writer of the eponymous hymn -- all of whom recommended that he remain in politics.While still wrestling with the decision, Wilberforce encountered Thomas Clarkson and several other abolitionists who convinced him that he could marry the two concepts -- by pushing hard for abolition in the political arena in which he found himself, he would be doing ""the Lord's work"".And therein lies the crux of the story for the Christian who is watching this film. While God certainly calls some to abandon a ""secular"" career for a ""sacred"" one, there is work to be done in the secular world in which we live. And Wilberforce did not stop wrestling with which way to go until God gave him a clear sign through Clarkson and company.How the story ended is obvious -- when's the last time you saw a British slave ship? But how it gets there, and the lives of those involved, is what is so compelling. I'm not really one for historical movies about 18th century Brits -- my dad rolls his eyes at my mom's enjoyment of what he calls ""stiff neck-ed"" movies -- but I was pulled in quite quickly. People from a distant land and even more distant time come alive as regular people.William Wilberforce was a man extraordinarily used by God in a ""secular"" profession.

654932,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,B00005JPOE,Chris Luallen,"[21, 21]","This film is focused on the little known, at least in America, but historically important William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) who played a vital role in putting an end to the African slave trade in Great Britain. The slave trade was abolished there in 1807, over 50 years before it was ended in the United States. This was especially significant because it was, to the best of my knowledge, the first time a political movement had succeeded in stopping the slave trade throughout an entire nation. It also went on to serve as an impetus and inspiration for the abolition of slavery throughout much of the world. Slavery, of course, being an oppressive practice that dates back to the earliest days of humananity and that has existed throughout world history, including today in parts of Africa, such as the Sudan.Director Michael Apted does a beautiful job of accurately portraying this important era in British history, with a fascinating set of characters that include Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger (Benedict Cumberhatch), Wilberforce's wife Barbara Spooner (Romola Garai) and former slave and abolitionist writer Olaudah Equiano (Youssou N'Dour). I especially enjoyed the character of John Newton (Albert Finney), the ex-slave trader turned abolitionist preacher who wrote ""Amazing Grace"".The movie is passionate without being self-righteous. It also manages to add some depth and nuance to it's characters, especially Wilberforce himself. He is depicted, later in life, as being disillusioned with politics and addicted to the opiate laudanum before his relationship with the young, idealistic Barbara manages to revive his hope and give him the energy to return to Parliament and eventually help pass the legislation that outlawed the British slave trade. An additional nice touch is that it shows how Christian evangelicalism has not always dominated by right wing Republicans. But instead were once leaders in the movement for progressive social change.This is a very fine film worthy of a large audience. I hope especially that young people and African-Americans turn out to see this movie because, as Bob Marley once sang, ""If you don't know your history, then you don't know where you're coming from"".

654933,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B00005JPOE,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[10, 142]","The target audience for this Michael Apted directed sleeper, best I can tell, are probably any reluctant conservatives out there who are in the market for the experience of, for just once, being on the side of something right and just. ""Look honey, not only are they against slavery, but they are for free education! I'm lovin' this being a liberal thing."" As I've stated before, anybody can beat up on a conquered issue but it takes one brave soul to go after a pressing issue of the day. We need more movies like ""Road to Guantanamo"" and fewer movies like this. And there really is no mistaking who this film is aimed at. It is a throwback to the early 90's art house, when they were filled almost exclusively with little old ladies and proper entertainment like this. So as we wait around to see if slavery is actually abolished we get to watch rich white people enjoying their mansions. Our hero William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) flirts with a girl two times just so that they can justify throwing a wedding up on screen. We get death bed scenes that spew the virtue of faith. And we get a happy ending that is happy because it results in procreation. Yeehaw!I pick on my dad a lot because he refuses to see costume dramas (""Take and adventure"" I say) but he does have a point, these things always tend to be stale. At the center of the story is William, who we learn led the charge in England to do away with the grand tradition of forced labor. It is a whitewash as Williams appears as saintly as can be which means that he is not a character but an ideal. He builds a coalition, collects signatures, and battles a very neutered opposition led by Ciaran Hinds and Toby Jones (or Julius Caesar and Truman Capote if you prefer). There is no drama because we know how history turns out, and since the characters are either bad or good we can't turn to them for excitement either. There is some sly humor mixed in, but unfortunately most of the jokes were duds (although I'm sure the gag where he pops out of the slave box killed with those aforementioned little old ladies). So there I was, stuck watching a movie that had no interest in doing anything so as not to offend anybody.I do find it disheartening that this film did so much better at the box office than Apted's last film ""49 Up"" ($19 million to $240,000) because that one was so much more intelligent than this one. Of course viewing habits in this country are disgraceful and the people only seem interested in showing up if you pander to them. In the middle of the film William tricks a bunch of stuffy pro-slave types into listening to his speech by promising them one thing and then delivering another. This gave me hope that, maybe possibly, Apted would pull a similar trick and deliver an unforeseen shot to the audience. But no such luck. On the plus side it does take a loving look at a true act of bravery in the campaign for equal rights for all. And Ciaran Hinds is always a welcome face. Still, those who are unseasoned in the art of sitting quietly through something of this type should stay home because it is exactly what the preview makes it out to be. I have no doubt that Apted's intentions were pure when he sat down to make ""Amazing Grace"" I just feel that somewhere along the way it turned into one big back patting session for Americans everywhere. **1/4",2,For Anybody Who Demands Nothing From Their Movies,1176508800,"04 14, 2007",2007,3343,"['target', 'audience', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'directed', 'sleeper', 'best', 'can', 'tell', 'are', 'probably', 'reluctant', 'conservatives', 'who', 'are', 'market', 'experience', 'just', 'once', 'being', 'side', 'something', 'right', 'just', 'Look', 'honey', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'slavery', 'are', 'free', 'education', ""'m"", 'lovin', 'being', 'liberal', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'stated', 'anybody', 'can', 'beat', 'up', 'conquered', 'issue', 'one', 'brave', 'soul', 'go', 'pressing', 'issue', 'day', 'need', 'more', 'movies', 'Road', 'Guantanamo', 'fewer', 'movies', 'really', 'mistaking', 'who', 'film', 'aimed', 'throwback', 'early', '90', 'art', 'house', 'when', 'were', 'filled', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'little', 'old', 'ladies', 'proper', 'entertainment', 'So', 'wait', 'around', 'see', 'slavery', 'actually', 'abolished', 'get', 'watch', 'rich', 'white', 'people', 'enjoying', 'mansions', 'hero', 'William', 'Wilberforce', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'girl', 'two', 'times', 'just', 'so', 'can', 'justify', 'throwing', 'wedding', 'up', 'screen', 'get', 'death', 'bed', 'scenes', 'spew', 'virtue', 'faith', 'get', 'happy', 'ending', 'happy', 'results', 'procreation', 'Yeehaw', 'pick', 'dad', 'lot', 'see', 'costume', 'dramas', 'Take', 'adventure', 'say', 'have', 'point', 'things', 'always', 'tend', 'be', 'stale', 'center', 'story', 'William', 'who', 'learn', 'led', 'charge', 'England', 'do', 'away', 'grand', 'tradition', 'forced', 'labor', 'whitewash', 'Williams', 'as', 'saintly', 'can', 'be', 'not', 'character', 'ideal', 'coalition', 'signatures', 'very', 'neutered', 'opposition', 'led', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'prefer', 'drama', 'know', 'how', 'history', 'out', 'characters', 'are', 'either', 'bad', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'turn', 'excitement', 'either', 'sly', 'humor', 'mixed', 'unfortunately', 'most', 'jokes', 'were', 'duds', ""'m"", 'sure', 'gag', 'where', 'slave', 'box', 'killed', 'aforementioned', 'little', 'old', 'ladies', 'was', 'stuck', 'watching', 'movie', 'had', 'interest', 'doing', 'anything', 'so', 'not', 'offend', 'anybody.I', 'do', 'find', 'disheartening', 'film', 'did', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'box', 'office', 'Apted', 'last', 'film', '49', 'Up', '19', 'million', '240,000', 'one', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'intelligent', 'one', 'course', 'viewing', 'habits', 'country', 'are', 'disgraceful', 'people', 'only', 'seem', 'interested', 'showing', 'up', 'pander', 'middle', 'film', 'William', 'bunch', 'stuffy', 'pro-slave', 'types', 'listening', 'speech', 'promising', 'one', 'thing', 'then', 'delivering', 'gave', 'hope', 'maybe', 'possibly', 'Apted', 'would', 'pull', 'similar', 'trick', 'deliver', 'unforeseen', 'shot', 'audience', 'such', 'luck', 'plus', 'side', 'take', 'loving', 'look', 'true', 'act', 'bravery', 'campaign', 'equal', 'rights', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'always', 'welcome', 'face', 'Still', 'who', 'are', 'unseasoned', 'art', 'sitting', 'quietly', 'something', 'type', 'should', 'stay', 'home', 'exactly', 'what', 'preview', 'out', 'be', 'have', 'doubt', 'Apted', 'intentions', 'were', 'pure', 'when', 'sat', 'down', 'make', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'just', 'feel', 'somewhere', 'way', 'turned', 'one', 'big', 'back', 'patting', 'session', 'Americans', 'everywhere', '**1/4']",Amazing Grace [Theatrical Release]

Unfortunately it did not receive a whole lot of attention, and had a fairly short theatrical run.  But I'm hoping it will do well on DVD.This is the true story of William Wilburforce, the man who stood alone in the English Parliament, working tirelessly to end the terrible slave trade in England.  It is an uplifting film, dramatically demonstrating how one man with a few loyal supporters can win the hearts of a nation and change the world.The message of Christ rings clear and true throughout the film, never descending to syrupy sentimentalism or beating the viewer over the head with preachy dialog.  One feels the moral conviction that drove Wilburforce to put his faith into action instead of being content to sit on the side and gaze and spiderwebs.I watched the film again this weekend after buying it on DVD.  And I was struck with the relevance it bears, especially this year.  With upcoming elections in the United States, many are tempted to look for ""electablility"" first and principle second.  We would do well to learn from William Wilburforce.  He was one man fighting the representatives of an entire nation for what he knew was right.I don't want to get too political here, but this is a political film in a political world.  To me, Ron Paul is a modern American Wilburforce.  He is one man standing for right in a Congress full of men molded by the establishment, just as Wilburforce stood against the whole of Parliament when slavery was accepted as the status quo.  They said Wilburforce was crazy.  An idealist whose morals could never work practically in the real world.So this next year I'll be voting for Ron Paul for President of the United States.",5,Amazing Grace for today,1195603200,"11 21, 2007",2007,1772,"['was', 'able', 'view', 'film', 'prescreening', 'few', 'weeks', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'Unfortunately', 'did', 'not', 'receive', 'whole', 'lot', 'attention', 'had', 'fairly', 'short', 'theatrical', 'run', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'will', 'do', 'well', 'DVD.This', 'true', 'story', 'William', 'Wilburforce', 'man', 'who', 'stood', 'alone', 'English', 'Parliament', 'working', 'tirelessly', 'end', 'terrible', 'slave', 'trade', 'England', 'uplifting', 'film', 'dramatically', 'demonstrating', 'how', 'one', 'man', 'few', 'loyal', 'supporters', 'can', 'win', 'hearts', 'nation', 'change', 'world.The', 'message', 'Christ', 'rings', 'clear', 'true', 'film', 'never', 'descending', 'syrupy', 'sentimentalism', 'beating', 'viewer', 'head', 'preachy', 'dialog', 'One', 'moral', 'conviction', 'drove', 'Wilburforce', 'put', 'faith', 'action', 'instead', 'being', 'content', 'sit', 'side', 'gaze', 'spiderwebs.I', 'watched', 'film', 'again', 'weekend', 'buying', 'DVD', 'was', 'struck', 'relevance', 'especially', 'year', 'upcoming', 'elections', 'United', 'States', 'many', 'are', 'tempted', 'look', 'electablility', 'first', 'principle', 'second', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'learn', 'William', 'Wilburforce', 'was', 'one', 'man', 'fighting', 'representatives', 'entire', 'nation', 'what', 'knew', 'was', 'right.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'too', 'political', 'here', 'political', 'film', 'political', 'world', 'Ron', 'Paul', 'modern', 'American', 'Wilburforce', 'one', 'man', 'standing', 'right', 'Congress', 'full', 'men', 'molded', 'establishment', 'just', 'Wilburforce', 'stood', 'whole', 'Parliament', 'when', 'slavery', 'was', 'accepted', 'status', 'quo', 'said', 'Wilburforce', 'was', 'crazy', 'idealist', 'morals', 'could', 'never', 'work', 'practically', 'real', 'world.So', 'next', 'year', ""'ll"", 'be', 'voting', 'Ron', 'Paul', 'President', 'United', 'States']",Amazing Grace [Theatrical Release]
654937,AUHG8KSHI529U,B00005JPOE,Craig Matteson,"[10, 11]","This is a good movie whose story is so important that it raises the movie above its quirks and flaws.  Simply, you should see this movie.  Better, you should read the book ""Amazing Grace"" and learn about the real life of William Wilberforce.  However, this movie is a fine place to start.  Yes, the nitpickers can find flaws (starting with the star being much taller than the character he is playing), but they really don't matter so much.William Wilberforce was the son of a very wealthy merchant family from Hull (northern England).  He was an orator of genius and very charismatic.  He had health issues with his bowels for which opium was the only remedy in his time.  His friends were the worldly types such as William Pitt the Younger and the very religious of the dissenter variety such as Isaac Milner and others.  When Pitt was converted and became a committed Christian he felt God had two important missions for him: To lift the lives of the poor and to free the slaves.This movie is not a biography of the life of William Wilberforce nor does aim to tell the whole story of the abolishment of slavery.  It is a picture that tells the story of that part of Wilberforce's life in Parliament that, over a generation, overthrew the slave trade.  While the movie is very impressionistic with the history of the Parliamentary battle, it does get the sense of opposition and hatred across to the viewer.  I found the jumping between the past and the movie's present time and bit confusing because the star, Ioan Gruffudd, doesn't age in any consistent way even though the last triumphant scene took place in 1833 when Wilberforce was out of Parliament and is a conflation of many successes along the way.  There was no single triumph that ended slavery once and for all.Charles Fox was never a Lord and had died in 1806.  John Newton was never the crazed hermit depicted in the movie.  The fiction created to represent him is well played by Albert Finney and captures the anguish and guilt felt by so many in the abolitionist movement for the society that had enslaved so many humans beings, but in no way captured the real life public activism of the former slave ship captain.Still, with the conflations, anachronisms, and outright fictions, you really should learn the name of William Wilberforce.  He was a great and good man who gave his life and fortune to the betterment of mankind.  But don't stop with the movie.  Your life will be enriched by getting to know the real life human being with all his complexity and struggles.Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI",4,"While not a great movie, it is a movie about a great man and you should see it.",1195689600,"11 22, 2007",2007,2579,"['good', 'movie', 'story', 'so', 'important', 'movie', 'quirks', 'flaws', 'Simply', 'should', 'see', 'movie', 'Better', 'should', 'read', 'book', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'learn', 'real', 'life', 'William', 'Wilberforce', 'However', 'movie', 'fine', 'place', 'start', 'Yes', 'nitpickers', 'can', 'find', 'flaws', 'starting', 'star', 'being', 'much', 'taller', 'character', 'playing', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'matter', 'so', 'much.William', 'Wilberforce', 'was', 'son', 'very', 'wealthy', 'merchant', 'family', 'Hull', 'northern', 'England', 'was', 'orator', 'genius', 'very', 'charismatic', 'had', 'health', 'issues', 'bowels', 'opium', 'was', 'only', 'remedy', 'time', 'friends', 'were', 'worldly', 'types', 'such', 'William', 'Pitt', 'Younger', 'very', 'religious', 'dissenter', 'variety', 'such', 'Isaac', 'Milner', 'others', 'When', 'Pitt', 'was', 'converted', 'became', 'committed', 'Christian', 'felt', 'God', 'had', 'two', 'important', 'missions', 'lift', 'lives', 'poor', 'free', 'slaves.This', 'movie', 'not', 'biography', 'life', 'William', 'Wilberforce', 'aim', 'tell', 'whole', 'story', 'abolishment', 'slavery', 'picture', 'story', 'part', 'Wilberforce', 'life', 'Parliament', 'generation', 'overthrew', 'slave', 'trade', 'movie', 'very', 'impressionistic', 'history', 'Parliamentary', 'battle', 'get', 'sense', 'opposition', 'hatred', 'viewer', 'found', 'jumping', 'past', 'movie', 'present', 'time', 'bit', 'confusing', 'star', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', ""n't"", 'age', 'consistent', 'way', 'even', 'last', 'triumphant', 'scene', 'took', 'place', '1833', 'when', 'Wilberforce', 'was', 'Parliament', 'conflation', 'many', 'successes', 'way', 'was', 'single', 'triumph', 'ended', 'slavery', 'once', 'all.Charles', 'Fox', 'was', 'never', 'Lord', 'had', 'died', '1806', 'John', 'Newton', 'was', 'never', 'crazed', 'hermit', 'depicted', 'movie', 'fiction', 'created', 'represent', 'well', 'played', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'anguish', 'guilt', 'felt', 'so', 'many', 'abolitionist', 'movement', 'society', 'had', 'enslaved', 'so', 'many', 'humans', 'beings', 'way', 'captured', 'real', 'life', 'public', 'activism', 'former', 'slave', 'ship', 'captain.Still', 'conflations', 'anachronisms', 'outright', 'fictions', 'really', 'should', 'learn', 'name', 'William', 'Wilberforce', 'was', 'great', 'good', 'man', 'who', 'gave', 'life', 'fortune', 'betterment', 'mankind', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'movie', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'enriched', 'getting', 'know', 'real', 'life', 'human', 'being', 'complexity', 'struggles.Reviewed', 'Craig', 'Matteson', 'Ann', 'Arbor', 'MI']",Amazing Grace [Theatrical Release]

It was easy to smell the lush English countryside, the dim old churches, and the stench of the slave ships. It plunges the viewer into late eighteenth, early nineteenth century England.I must admit, however, that I was a bit confused by the portrayal of the Duke of Clarence, the future William IV, as an unappealing midget. Did the prince, whom I have always thought of as a very handsome man, really spend that much time lounging around the House of Commons? I thought Clarence was usually to be found with the navy, or with Mrs. Jordan and their ten children. But then I do not really know that much about him.The story pivots around the first encounter of politician William Wilberforce with the lovely, idealistic young lady who was to become his wife. Barbara encouraged Wilberforce to persevere in his struggle to outlaw the slave trade in the British Empire, in spite of his many health problems. The wealthy merchants and their representatives in parliament stood against him. It is interesting that in autocratic France, slavery had long been abolished; a former slave, the Chevalier de Saint-Georges, held an exalted post at the court of Versailles.Wilberforce, a devout Christian, gained popular support for the cause through education, boycotts, and skillful political maneuvering. His character, portrayed by Ioann Grufudd as an eccentric English country gentleman, in love with God, is utterly captivating.

654949,A2LRWMHJ1ZK36M,B00005JPOE,e. verrillo,"[2, 2]","Amazing Grace chronicled the story of William Wilberforce, a key figure behind the British Abolition movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The film had an unfortunate tendency to hop around from ""the past"" to ""the present"" (which was also the past--dates would have been helpful). But basically, it was a tale well told--nicely filmed, well acted, and with a stirring soundtrack.Like John Newton (the man who wrote the hymn, ""Amazing Grace""), Wilberforce was primarily motivated by a conversion to Evangelical Christianity. Although little is made of his conversion in the film, this epiphany continued to inspire him throughout his life and provided the basis for many of the social reforms he championed.While Amazing Grace was true to the spirit of the times, there were some significant inaccuracies. Departures from real history are expected in films, and I wouldn't normally point them out. However, in this case, the discrepancies tended to detract from the film rather than enhance it. First, John Newton, Wilberforce's friend and religious model, was an Anglican priest, not a rag-clothed penitent. It was not until late in his life that Newton repented of his earlier slave-trading days, and by then he had a congregation. Depicting Newton as someone who scrubbed floors in a burlap sack lent a distinctly melodramatic, off-key note to the story.The second major discrepancy is that Wilberforce was in his seventies when the act to abolish slavery throughout the British Empire was finally passed. (He died a mere three days later.) In the movie he was shown as middle-aged, which, while better for the love story, really didn't capture the dedication of a man who literally spent his entire adult life devoted to the abolitionist cause.Although I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for a high school class (students need to get their facts straight), Amazing Grace was a good, solid introduction to the history of the abolitionist movement. One can only imagine the course American history would have taken if the Revolution had occurred after the passage of the anti-slavery acts, rather than before.",4,"Not quite accurate, but a decent film nonetheless",1257897600,"11 11, 2009",2009,2125,"['Amazing', 'Grace', 'chronicled', 'story', 'William', 'Wilberforce', 'key', 'figure', 'British', 'Abolition', 'movement', 'late', '18th', 'early', '19th', 'centuries', 'film', 'had', 'unfortunate', 'tendency', 'hop', 'around', 'past', 'present', 'was', 'also', 'past', 'dates', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'helpful', 'basically', 'was', 'tale', 'well', 'told', 'nicely', 'filmed', 'well', 'acted', 'stirring', 'soundtrack.Like', 'John', 'Newton', 'man', 'who', 'wrote', 'hymn', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'Wilberforce', 'was', 'primarily', 'motivated', 'conversion', 'Evangelical', 'Christianity', 'little', 'made', 'conversion', 'film', 'epiphany', 'continued', 'inspire', 'life', 'provided', 'basis', 'many', 'social', 'reforms', 'championed.While', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'was', 'true', 'spirit', 'times', 'were', 'significant', 'inaccuracies', 'Departures', 'real', 'history', 'are', 'expected', 'films', 'would', ""n't"", 'normally', 'point', 'out', 'However', 'case', 'discrepancies', 'tended', 'detract', 'film', 'rather', 'enhance', 'First', 'John', 'Newton', 'Wilberforce', 'friend', 'religious', 'model', 'was', 'Anglican', 'priest', 'not', 'rag-clothed', 'penitent', 'was', 'not', 'late', 'life', 'Newton', 'repented', 'earlier', 'slave-trading', 'days', 'then', 'had', 'congregation', 'Depicting', 'Newton', 'someone', 'who', 'scrubbed', 'floors', 'burlap', 'sack', 'lent', 'distinctly', 'melodramatic', 'off-key', 'note', 'story.The', 'second', 'major', 'discrepancy', 'Wilberforce', 'was', 'seventies', 'when', 'act', 'abolish', 'slavery', 'British', 'Empire', 'was', 'finally', 'passed', 'died', 'mere', 'three', 'days', 'later', 'movie', 'was', 'shown', 'middle-aged', 'better', 'love', 'story', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'capture', 'dedication', 'man', 'who', 'literally', 'spent', 'entire', 'adult', 'life', 'devoted', 'abolitionist', 'cause.Although', 'would', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'recommend', 'high', 'school', 'class', 'students', 'need', 'get', 'facts', 'straight', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'was', 'good', 'solid', 'introduction', 'history', 'abolitionist', 'movement', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'course', 'American', 'history', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'Revolution', 'had', 'occurred', 'passage', 'anti-slavery', 'acts', 'rather', 'before']",Amazing Grace [Theatrical Release]

Ioan Gruffudd was better than I expected as Wilberforce. My beef is with Michael Apted the director for giving such a blatantly unhistorical drama. I do not have time to list the errors but the two most blatant ones are to do with John Newton. The present tune we sing to Amazing Grace was unknown in England at that time so Wilberforce would never have sung it. Newton was not a monk plagued by guilt for being a slave captain. He was a vicar who knew God's grace and forgiveness, hence the hymn. Right from the start when a screen caption told us the British Empire was built on the back of slaves one sensed that present day (erroneous) judgment may be evident. Wilberforce was not bothered by his addiction to opium. It was the one analgesic available and he controlled, not increased, his dosage throughout his life. I do though doubt that he would have been alone with an unmarried lady, unchaperoned through the night. The production is so inaccurate I thought that the director must be American, but no, to our shame he is British, portraying a royal duke in the House of Commons, Fox erroneously ennobled and still there to give the econium on Wilberforce in the hour of triumph though Fox died before 1807.It was not merely the historical inaccuracy that disappointed me. The flash backs were confusing and took away from the whirlwind nature of Wilberforce's courtship. I found the whole thing rather dull and not a patch on say, Chariots of Fire for an inspirational Christian theme. It was sympathetically done but could have been so much better.

654956,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005JPOE,Grady Harp,"[35, 40]","AMAZING GRACE  is a beautifully mounted, well-scripted, powerful film that reminds us that there were heroes in the late 1700s who vehemently fought the fight for abolition of slavery. Benefiting from a tight intelligent script by Steven Knight and directed with great sensitivity and fluidity by Michael Apted, the film captures the flavor of the turn of the 18th century into 19th century in England when slavery was a commodity the wealthy could ill afford to lose, and how the courage and perseverance of William Wilberforce created probably one of the first human rights movements on record.William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) witnessed the horrors of transporting slaves from Africa to be sold around the world to wealthy plantation owners and to serve as cheap and disrespected servants to the British populace.  Encouraged by a previous slave dealer John Newton (Albert Finney) turned contrite priest, his friend Prime Minister William Pitt (Benedict Cumberbatch), and the informed woman of his life Barbara Spooner (Romola Garai), Wilberforce bonds with a band of abolitionists including Thomas Clarkson (Rufus Sewell) and Oloudaqh Equiano (Youssou N'Dour) and begins long years of battling for abolition in the Parliament where cads such as Lord Tarleton (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) and the Duke of Clarence (Toby Jones) fight his every word.One of the hallmarks of this fine film is the dignity it sustains: in a film that could have easily focused on depictions of slave abuse to make its point, it instead elects to keep the focus on the heart of the struggle against the inhumanity by subtle yet powerful means.  The title of the film, of course, comes form the song the reformed John Newton wrote as he had a life altering experience to end his slave trading to fight for human rights.  It is a haunting reminder that is used throughout the film in the score by David Arnold.  The cast is uniformly excellent with not only first class performances by each of the leads, but also by superb cameos from such fine artists as Michael Gambon, Nicholas Farrell, Sylvestra Le Touzel, Jeremy Swift, and Stephen Campbell Moore.

While I am certainly an admirer of Wilberforce, who also created the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (which in this country is known as the ASPCA) and his story is well worth telling, This film does not do him full justice.To look at it is a lovely film with amzaing details to set, costuming and the like. It is the true story of an amazing man who stood up for years to fight injustice. He opposed the powerful slave owning and slave trading lobbys and took them on, sometimes standing alone as the one voice of human dignity against the reek of money and inhumanity. but the one question the film never answers is 'why?"" Why does he do it. In the 21st century I'm sure this would not be an issue. We now all see slavery as the abominationm that it is, but this was a most uncommon view in the late 17th century, so:Why did Wilburforce take up the banner?Why did this one one have vision that no one else did?What, if anything, did he suffer for this unpopular stand?One comes away from the film feeling like you missed the first 1/3rd of the story, the part in which this one couragous man is inspired to take up the cause. The audience have been shown worse scenes of slaver treatment in ""Roots"" a generation ago.Even the trip to the slave ship is sanitized. If we are to believe it was at a dinner where some churchmen call on him, then he is portrayed as very pliable, not something which his life or the rest of the film would imply.Without this momment of revealation the film plays out like a pagent. Individual scenes are excellent but there is a lacking overall sense of expectation or risk. In the penultimate scene where the anti-slavery bill is passed, the speaker reads out the votes 'yay' and 'nay' but since we had not heard any such vote totals in the past this lacks the excitemnt of the victory the true vote must have had. You know he's going to win.The very last scene is a British military band, lead by a lone piper playing Amazing Grace, possibly one of the most beautiful hymns ever written, made more so if you know the tale behind it. The man who wrote it was not a slave owner. He was a slave trader who brought ship loads of people into bondage. Then, in one Atlantic crossing, in a terrible storm he had an epiphany and did not just give up the trade, he turned the ship around and released the people in his hold already.""Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me.""He dedicated the rest of his life to atoning for his sins but in the terms of the movie, the military band makes absolutely no sense. A chruch choir would have been far more fitting.My poor review is not of Wilberforce or his achievments, but of this film about them. It is a tale of a man with vision and compassion far beyond his time. Wonderful to look at ""Amazing grace"" does him a disservice by short selling his character, his life and his accomplishments.",2,Does not do justce to an Amazing tale,1195948800,"11 25, 2007",2007,2978,"['fear', 'will', 'be', 'lone', 'saying', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'am', 'certainly', 'admirer', 'Wilberforce', 'who', 'also', 'created', 'Society', 'Prevention', 'Cruelty', 'Animals', 'country', 'known', 'ASPCA', 'story', 'well', 'worth', 'telling', 'film', 'not', 'do', 'full', 'justice.To', 'look', 'lovely', 'film', 'amzaing', 'details', 'set', 'costuming', 'like', 'true', 'story', 'amazing', 'man', 'who', 'stood', 'up', 'years', 'fight', 'injustice', 'opposed', 'powerful', 'slave', 'owning', 'slave', 'trading', 'lobbys', 'took', 'sometimes', 'standing', 'alone', 'one', 'voice', 'human', 'dignity', 'reek', 'money', 'inhumanity', 'one', 'question', 'film', 'never', 'answers', ""'why"", 'Why', 'do', '21st', 'century', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'issue', 'now', 'see', 'slavery', 'abominationm', 'was', 'most', 'uncommon', 'view', 'late', '17th', 'century', 'Why', 'did', 'Wilburforce', 'take', 'up', 'banner', 'Why', 'did', 'one', 'one', 'have', 'vision', 'one', 'else', 'did', 'What', 'anything', 'did', 'suffer', 'unpopular', 'stand', 'One', 'away', 'film', 'feeling', 'missed', 'first', '1/3rd', 'story', 'part', 'one', 'couragous', 'man', 'inspired', 'take', 'up', 'cause', 'audience', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'worse', 'scenes', 'slaver', 'treatment', 'Roots', 'generation', 'trip', 'slave', 'ship', 'sanitized', 'are', 'believe', 'was', 'dinner', 'where', 'churchmen', 'call', 'then', 'portrayed', 'very', 'pliable', 'not', 'something', 'life', 'rest', 'film', 'would', 'imply.Without', 'momment', 'revealation', 'film', 'out', 'pagent', 'Individual', 'scenes', 'are', 'excellent', 'lacking', 'overall', 'sense', 'expectation', 'risk', 'penultimate', 'scene', 'where', 'anti-slavery', 'bill', 'passed', 'speaker', 'out', 'votes', ""'nay"", 'had', 'not', 'heard', 'such', 'vote', 'totals', 'past', 'excitemnt', 'victory', 'true', 'vote', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'know', 'going', 'win.The', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'British', 'military', 'band', 'lead', 'lone', 'piper', 'playing', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'possibly', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'hymns', 'ever', 'written', 'made', 'more', 'so', 'know', 'tale', 'man', 'who', 'wrote', 'was', 'not', 'slave', 'owner', 'was', 'slave', 'trader', 'who', 'brought', 'ship', 'loads', 'people', 'bondage', 'Then', 'one', 'Atlantic', 'crossing', 'terrible', 'storm', 'had', 'epiphany', 'did', 'not', 'just', 'give', 'up', 'trade', 'turned', 'ship', 'released', 'people', 'hold', 'already', 'Amazing', 'grace', 'how', 'sweet', 'sound', 'saved', 'wretch', 'dedicated', 'rest', 'life', 'atoning', 'sins', 'terms', 'movie', 'military', 'band', 'absolutely', 'sense', 'chruch', 'choir', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'fitting.My', 'poor', 'review', 'not', 'Wilberforce', 'achievments', 'film', 'tale', 'man', 'vision', 'compassion', 'far', 'time', 'Wonderful', 'look', 'Amazing', 'grace', 'disservice', 'short', 'selling', 'character', 'life', 'accomplishments']",Amazing Grace [Theatrical Release]

654962,A192KEPM0HW6AC,B00005JPOE,"Interplanetary Funksmanship ""Swift lippin', e...","[14, 15]","Every decade or so, a motion picture comes along that captures its subject's heroic essence so perfectly that the film becomes its subject. Such is the case with British director Michael Apted's superb biopic on abolitionist William Wilberforce, passionately portrayed by Welsh actor Ioan Gruffudd.Though Wilberforce is largely unknown to Americans today, this movie is an excellent introduction to the great English parliamentarian who devoted twenty years of his life to eradicating the slave trade throughout the British Empire. (All slavery had been abolished in Great Britain itself by a judicial decision in 1772.) A devoutly religious though thoroughly skeptical man, Wilberforce figured prominently during both the Enlightenment and Britain's Evangelical Revival.The movie opens as the eighteenth century draws to a close, with Wilberforce not at the beginning of his crusade to end the barbaric practice of slavery, but at what seems to be its most hopeless point. Once one of the youngest members of the House of Commons and a powerful orator, he's now gaunt and dejected, having nearly exhausted his fortune and health in service of his fight.Riding in a carriage along the muddy road in the rain, he happens upon a driver whipping his fallen horse. Moved to the animal's defense (he was a founding member of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals), Wilberforce uses simple logic to persuade the driver to cease his brutal flogging, explaining that the horse would more likely regain its strength if left to recover for an hour. This simple exchange, in which he achieves his ideals through practical persuasion, reveals his forceful personality and unyielding integrity, traits that would serve him so well throughout his career as a legislator.Wilberforce is on his way to the resort town of Bath, There, he hopes, the famous mineral springs will heal his body from the ravages of colitis and addiction to laudanum, an opiate prescribed by his doctors. When he arrives, however, his friends, economist Henry Thornton (Nicholas Farrell) and his wife Marianne (Sylvestra Le Touzel), have a different sort of tonic in mind to cure what ails him. They slyly maneuver their friend into a ""chance"" meeting with a ravishingly beautiful young abolitionist and social reformer, Barbara Spooner (Romola Garai). Resenting his friends' manipulations, he at first rebuffs her. But the Thorntons are relentless and soon set him up again, bringing Barbara to dinner at Wilberforce's house.This time their chemistry is too powerful to deny. Barbara and William launch a long conversation that extends into the wee hours. The subject turns to his tireless but fruitless efforts to stop the slave trade, a story told in flashbacks that constitute the bulk of the film.Elected to Parliament at twenty-one in 1780, Wilberforce barrels into the House of Commons full of piss and vinegar, taking on all comers with his confrontational debating style and razor-sharp wit. One dewy morning, as he lolls about his lawn, transfixed at the intricacy of God's handiwork in a spider web, he experiences a spiritual epiphany.After his conversion, Wilberforce's interest in the affairs of state evaporates and he ponders a life of religious contemplation. But to those around him--especially William Pitt the Younger (Benedict Cumberbatch), a friend in Parliament who's angling to become Britain's youngest Prime Minister--Wilberforce's divine spark would be better put to practical use. Pitt asks him, ""Do you intend to use your beautiful voice to praise the Lord, or to change the world?""Wilberforce isn't convinced until a group of Quaker abolitionists visit one evening. They bring along a liberated slave from the New World, Olaudah Equiano (Youssou N'Dour), whose memoirs about his horrific passage from Africa would soon spark public outrage against the peculiar institution. He is shocked by the brand on Equiano's chest (""to let you know you no longer belong to God, but to a man,"" the former slave explains) and by his iron shackles.""We understand you're having problems choosing whether to do the work of God, or the work of a political activist,"" says radical abolitionist Thomas Clarkson (Rufus Sewell). Another guest (Georgie Glen) finishes the thought: ""We humbly suggest that you can do both.""Taking up the battle, Wilberforce introduces a bill every year to abolish the slave trade--and every year the bill is defeated. Yet he perseveres. In a nation where slavery is largely out of sight and mind, he constantly contrives ways to force it into the faces of polite society. He launches petition drives and sponsors meetings where Equiano lectures and sells copies of his book. At a gathering of MPs and their wives aboard a tour boat, the captain weighs anchor alongside a slave ship just returned from a run between Africa and Jamaica. Wilberforce notes that only a third of the original six hundred passengers survived the journey, and exclaims, ""That smell is the smell of death. Slow, painful death. . . .Breathe it deeply. Take those handkerchiefs away from your noses! There now, remember that smell.""Wilberforce ends his painful reminiscing, too taxed to go on. Barbara is clearly moved, finding inspiration in his struggle. The two passionately talk of their ideals, while the sexual tension silently builds between them. If Barbara's fiery red tresses, flawless peaches-and-cream complexion, and corseted, heaving cleavage weren't sufficient to bag the man, nothing would have stirred him. Without a word spoken of love (not to mention sex), romance blossoms instantly and inevitably.As morning breaks, the two announce their engagement to their friends.I like this little touch, coming as it did from out of left field. This is old-fashioned moviemaking at its best, with courtship scenes far more erotically charged than the crassly explicit sex in most movies nowadays.Their marriage and Barbara's pregnancy become a beautifully simple metaphor for Wilberforce's own regeneration of health and will. He heads back to Parliament to fight the good fight once more. Political intrigue moves front and center as Tories Wilberforce and Pitt, along with the abolitionist Clarkson and Whig MP Charles Fox (Michael Gambon, best known as the Headmaster in the Harry Potter series), put their heads together to plot the end of the slave trade. What follows is the best depiction of political machinations that I've seen since Otto Preminger's political thriller Advise & Consent, based on Allen Drury's novel. Witnessing Wilberforce's ultimate triumph left me nearly breathless.Costume dramas usually leave me yawning, but not this time. Production designer Charles Wood's painstakingly researched and designed sets lends the movie period authenticity, while Remi Adefarasin's factual cinematography downplays idiosyncratic camera angles and lets the actors and the settings predominate. Writer Steven Knight and director Apted's deft balance of gravitas and levity give the whole business a timeless feel befitting its hero's stature, but without clumsy signposting.The only drawback, I felt, was that Albert Finney, in an otherwise bravura performance, seemed underused--especially considering his pivotal role as John Newton, the former slave-ship captain who later repented and penned the moving hymn for which the film is named. While the scenes depicting his influence on Wilberforce were succinct and heartrending, they also felt somewhat truncated.Amazing Grace, whose release was timed to coincide with the 200th anniversary of Wilberforce's legislative victory, February 23, 1807, has been well received by faithful and secular, conservative and liberal. Still, it generated some criticism on the pages of the Wall Street Journal, where guest columnist Charlotte Allen found a ""cover-up"" of Wilberforce's evangelical Christianity. But the film was not about his religious motives per se; it was about his campaign to end slavery. I think she missed the forest for the trees: The slave-trade abolition was Wilberforce's apotheosis, and that is exactly what Apted put up on the screen.In a recent interview, producer Patricia Heaton (herself an outspoken, religiously motivated opponent of abortion) described Amazing Grace as an inspiring biography of ""the Abraham Lincoln of England"" and as an antidote to our ""age of such cynicism and despair, particularly about politics and religion.""I agree. William Wilberforce is historically significant for his courageous actions in stopping an inhuman evil. While religion played no small part in motivating those actions, I really doubt that so many talented people would have assembled such an unabashed labor of love as this movie had Wilberforce decided to spend his days contemplating God's grandeur, while ignoring his own potential for personal greatness.",5,Grace Under Pressure,1189814400,"09 15, 2007",2007,8829,"['decade', 'so', 'motion',

Spoken by the brilliant Margaret Mead, never were truer words spoken. And this grand film is a testimonial to them.Amazing Grace tells the story of England's attempt to banish slavery from its kingdom. Hurting after the loss of those rapscallion colonies, the British Parliament is debating whether or not to end the African slave trade. One William Wilberforce, a devoted social rights advocate (evidenced by his fondness for animals and the poor), takes up the cause after a particular confrontation with a group of abolitionists one night at dinner. It turns out the journey to end the slave trade begins to wreck his health, and despite some clever ploys to get people to side with him, he ends up strung out on laudanum. Enter Barbara Spooner, herself an advocate for the many social causes that Wilber himself believes in, begins to rejuvinate his devotion and ardor.The performances of Ioan Gruffudd and Romola Garai carry this film throughout. As Wilber, Ioan is passionate and deeply committed to his performance. Early on, we discover that he finds God (or does God find him, he ponders). Rather than being overwrought and preachy, Gruffudd's sense of joy is palpable. Albert Finney's turn as the former slave ship captain that reforms and writes the title song is brief but glorious, making me wish he was in more films.Nothing, the stirring music nor the wonderful performances, can overcome the raw emotion this film has. As the people struggle against great odds, there passion and sense of justice only grows. Somehow, from somewhere, they only get stronger in their search for emancipation. This culminates in a final scene that swells with emotion without ever being melodramatic; with fervor without ever being harried.And as the final scene with the bagpipe and band playing the infamous tune ""Amazing Grace"" becomes even more than this.

Because the song refers to God's grace, poured out on the undeserving. Wilberforce's faith was not a component of his life; it was what drove his every action. But this movie was clearly made by people who see religious belief as a quaint custom from the past. It exemplifies a very modern sensibility: Christianity, if it must exist at all, should be a social club dedicated to doing good works. ""Oh how nice it was when those nice religious folks did such nice things,"" say, I suppose, the Hollywood folk who created this pap. But the lyrics to Amazing Grace are not about doing good things. Even worthy good things. They show how God rescues us from sin and despair and gives us new life. ""I was blind, but now I see."" Despite the droning bagpipes and funereal pace that conclude the film, it is a happy song. We have received a priceless gift. Wilberforce is never shown as either blind or seeing. And his faith is a jolly willingness to enjoy nature, but little more.So, the drive that came from unshakable faith is missing. We see a driven man, but driven because he's a softy, not because he loves God. And how did a whole culture change its mind in just a few years? Slavery had been the way of the world since the beginning of time (and still is in many places.) The English, the owner of the seas, making a good living transporting this human cargo, stopped. And gave up an immensely profitable practice. That is an astounding, nearly unparalleled, accomplishment. How did this happen? One man? No, there was much more going on during this time, and we witness precious little of that. It's as if Wilberforce was working in a vacuum (sure we see the petitions, though why a body generally elected by a very tiny percentage of the populace would care about them I cannot say.)And, I suppose, as a sop to feminists, his wife is portrayed as a fiery believer, capable of an all-night discussion (which would never have happened between two unmarried people such as these) not the happy stay-at-home mom she apparently was.Not a bad film, with superlative performances all around, but one that downplays what was important to its protagonists and focuses on what is important to a contemporary audience.",3,Ran the half mile in a mile race,1195084800,"11 15, 2007",2007,2326,"['Amazing', 'Grace', 'silly', 'title', 'film', 'designed', 'assume', 'capture', 'conservative', 'Christian', 'audience', 'Why', 'song', 'refers', 'God', 'grace', 'poured', 'out', 'undeserving', 'Wilberforce', 'faith', 'was', 'not', 'component', 'life', 'was', 'what', 'drove', 'action', 'movie', 'was', 'clearly', 'made', 'people', 'who', 'see', 'religious', 'belief', 'quaint', 'custom', 'past', 'very', 'modern', 'sensibility', 'Christianity', 'must', 'exist', 'should', 'be', 'social', 'club', 'dedicated', 'doing', 'good', 'works', 'Oh', 'how', 'nice', 'was', 'when', 'nice', 'religious', 'folks', 'did', 'such', 'nice', 'things', 'say', 'suppose', 'Hollywood', 'folk', 'who', 'created', 'pap', 'lyrics', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'are', 'not', 'doing', 'good', 'things', 'Even', 'worthy', 'good', 'things', 'show', 'how', 'God', 'sin', 'despair', 'new', 'life', 'was', 'blind', 'now', 'see', 'droning', 'bagpipes', 'funereal', 'pace', 'conclude', 'film', 'happy', 'song', 'have', 'received', 'priceless', 'gift', 'Wilberforce', 'never', 'shown', 'blind', 'seeing', 'faith', 'jolly', 'willingness', 'enjoy', 'nature', 'little', 'more.So', 'drive', 'came', 'unshakable', 'faith', 'missing', 'see', 'driven', 'man', 'driven', 'softy', 'not', 'God', 'how', 'did', 'whole', 'culture', 'change', 'mind', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'Slavery', 'had', 'been', 'way', 'world', 'beginning', 'time', 'still', 'many', 'places', 'English', 'owner', 'seas', 'making', 'good', 'living', 'transporting', 'human', 'cargo', 'stopped', 'gave', 'up', 'immensely', 'profitable', 'practice', 'astounding', 'nearly', 'unparalleled', 'accomplishment', 'How', 'did', 'happen', 'One', 'man', 'No', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'going', 'time', 'witness', 'precious', 'little', 'Wilberforce', 'was', 'working', 'vacuum', 'sure', 'see', 'petitions', 'though', 'why', 'body', 'generally', 'elected', 'very', 'tiny', 'percentage', 'populace', 'would', 'care', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'suppose', 'sop', 'feminists', 'wife', 'portrayed', 'fiery', 'believer', 'capable', 'all-night', 'discussion', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'happened', 'two', 'unmarried', 'people', 'such', 'not', 'happy', 'stay-at-home', 'mom', 'apparently', 'was.Not', 'bad', 'film', 'superlative', 'performances', 'around', 'one', 'what', 'was', 'important', 'protagonists', 'focuses', 'what', 'important', 'contemporary', 'audience']",Amazing Grace [Theatrical Release]

The love story, although it was a minor part of the movie, was done well. The story needed to be told and the movie told it well. One of the bad points was the movie jumped around in Wilberforce's life quite a bit. Following the time shifts was confusing at times. As the movie went along, the plot was easier to follow.I read a short biography of Wilberforce and I heard a talk on Newton. I can't claim any expertise on these men, but what little I know of them made me question the movie's historical accuracy. Newton had a congregation. He was not a hermit mopping up a church. He was a popular Anglican preacher. Finney did a great job in the part, but I don't think it represented Newton very well. Wouldn't a better charactorization have been a more historic portrayal of Newton who was a slave trader that became a slave of Christ by serving and preaching to all? Rather than a guilt-ridden old man?I also wished the movie spent more time on Wilberforce's conversion and beliefs. Wilberforce was a thoughtful Christian who wrote books on what he believed. Wilberforce's stamina according to Wilberforce was his reformed faith. The movie just had him studying nature in a worshipful manner in his garden.In summary, I liked the movie and I enjoyed it. The message needed to be told and it was told well. How England avoided a bloody civil war because of this issue and resolved the issues through a peaceful process was instructive.

If that is true, then it is the best reason of all for the abolition of slavery then......and now.And the film is worth watching for one other piece of history. William Pitt the younger still holds the record as the youngest Prime Minister in the history of England. He bacame Prime Minister at the age of 24. One year too young to run for the House in the US. And eleven years to young to run for president.

654974,A2B0DPQK20LYYJ,B00005JPOE,J. Michael,"[5, 12]","This movie romantically dramatizes the Parliamentary efforts of bleeding-heart nabob William Wilberforce to abolish slavery in the British Empire. It is well made liberal hagiography with good production value and some well known actors, but the Manichean simplicity of such agitprop is becoming very tiresome to me as I get older. The slave holders are all evil and the abolitionists are all saints (that's literally what they were known as, which demonstrates the lunatic boundlessness of liberal arrogance). We are even shown Wilberforce taking on the role of ""alter Christus"" as he undergoes another Passion through his physical ailments and the stress of his abolitionist crusade. There's just no gray areas in this movie, no deeper questions about an issue that still haunts us to this day.Even if one holds slavery to be a human rights injustice, it's pretty hard for someone to turn that into a sinful offense against the Christian God, as the abolitionists claimed, considering that the Lord Jesus Himself never saw fit to address the issue while He was on earth and His own Scriptures condone the institution in the clearest terms, even going so far as to enjoin slaves to obey their masters. Why then do we still accept the demonization of slave owners that abolitionists engaged in? In the 1750 years or so between the ministry of Christ and the birth of the abolitionist movement, should we not ask why so minuscule a number of Christians, who read the same Bible and worshipped the same God as Wilberforce and his ""saints"", came to the same conclusions about slavery as they did? Slavery, after all, was an ancient and venerable tradition in every part of the world, especially Africa, whose role in the Atlantic slave trade goes unacknowledged in this movie. Without the help of the Africans themselves, there would have been no slave trade for Wilberforce to rail against. Instead, this film leads the ignorant to heed the fictional tale of an African ""prince"" who was captured by marauding White men. It's a horrible thought, but is it perhaps nature's law that the strong and advanced will ever rule the weak and primitive, that a part of humanity is born with saddles on their back, ready to be ridden by those born booted and spurred? Will slavery be seen again in history, once the relatively brief and artificial interlude of Anglo-American liberalism is overcome by the inexorable forces of nature and its own degenerative qualities? What does it portend when recent news reports quote several Africans, disgusted by the universal failure of their liberated continent, as openly expressing a desire for the return of European colonialism?While Wilberforce had a legitimately charitable heart and may not have been as bad as many of his compatriots, who bewailed the fate of the African slaves, while scorning the cries of five-year-old White children who went to their early graves working 16 hours a day in mines and factories, his sympathies often did not extend to his own people's horrific conditions. He opposed the right of workers to organize for better conditions and pay, and was described by one notable Englishman as someone who ""who preaches vital Christianity to untutored savages, and tolerates its worst abuses in civilised states"". Another activist told Wilberforce that ""Never have you done one single act, in favour of the labourers of this country."" Where is the movie about the White serfs of the British Empire, who often lived in worse conditions than slaves? Why are we not incessantly reminded about the White blood that fueled the Industrial Revolution?Another uncomfortable question this movie raises is why American abolitionists had to resort to bloody civil war to free the slaves, when Great Britain achieved the same goal legally and peacefully with financial compensation for slave owners. Slavery would have withered and died within a few decades even had there not been a Civil War. Without favoring slavery, perhaps our northern abolitionists should be cursed as Jacobin fanatics who sacrificed 600,000 Americans on the altar of their revolutionary mania.Another unexamined issue in this movie is the fate of the liberated. In order to prove the equality of Africans, Wilberforce and his people set up the free colony of Sierra Leone, which was populated by starry-eyed Whites and freed blacks, and liberally funded by wealthy friends. Wikipedia says ""The dream was of an ideal society in which races would mix on equal terms; the reality was fraught with tension, crop failures, disease, death, war and defections to the slave trade."" Today, Sierra Leone ""is the lowest ranked country on the Human Development Index and seventh lowest on the Human Poverty Index, suffering from endemic corruption, suppression of the press and the HIV/AIDS pandemic."" (also from wikipedia). The history of every single other black society on earth reflects the same attributes. This movie makes it seem like the Africans' troubles were over once some White men passed a bill in London. Wilberforce's abolition bill was indeed significant, but by no means got to the root of the problem, and in most ways it seems like African quality of life has only declined since the 19th century.I'm not defending slavery and I do think Wilberforce accomplished a good thing with the abolition of slavery. I just think the issue isn't as cut and dried as Hollywood History for Dummies would lead us to believe.",3,Saint Wilberforce's crusade,1209254400,"04 27, 2008",2008,5439,"['movie', 'romantically',

Not only is this film a fantastic one that will capture every once of your attention, but it can also be used as a great teaching tool for classrooms. I don't recall ever knowing who Wilberforce was, let alone what he did to mark his place in history during my days in the classroom? An ensembled cast of fantastic actors make this film what it is, and perhaps what I found to be one of the most powerful and sad ones at the same time was Newton, played by the great Albert Finney. Newton was a reformed slave ship captain. He, who both wrote the hymn ""Amazing Grace"" and provides the title to this film, gave up his wretched ways as a peddler of human souls to ""God"" to repent for his years in the trade. Feeling both haunted and guilty of his past, Newton helps provide the passion Wilberforce requires to pursue his long efforts to abolish slavery throughout England once and for all. His struggle to peruse the bill to rid England of slavery was a long one, and took a terrible toll on his health through the years until his victory. Wilberforce not only abolished slavery, but also reformed prisons, education and health care in the UK. This is a film to watch and appreciate. Not all political films bore you into a coma; this certainly is one that does not. I highly recommend this film to not only watch, but to learn from and to see how far we have come, but to also see how much further we as a human race still need to go.

I did not really know what to expect with the exception that I was told it was about the abolition of slavery in England.  What a great story for all to learn that it was the Anglos in England who were amongst the first to abolish slavery.  It is not a story we hear much about.  Wilberforce got religion as they say.  His mentor, John Newton, who wrote the hymn 'Amazing Grace,' taught him about what slavery was.  In the theatrical version of the story, Wilberforce wanted to go into the ministry.  Newton suggests to him his calling is to free the slaves, to make that his life's work.Oh that we had such passion for the things of this life today.  I liked it becaused it showed about the potential in man to accomplish great things if he has a heart.  I am a believer in God, yet, not a religionist.  Religion, sometimes, causes more difficulty because it is so much like men and not like the God that it is attached to.  Wilberforce lived his religion.  Who knows though, maybe he was an enlightened soul, who really was against the crown, or maybe he really saw the commonalities between himself and the Jacobites in France.  He was able to hold forth in his battle in the Parliament.It is a story like no other in recent times.  I hope that more come to see it, that it gets its time in the media.  We never really heard much about it.  It is a story for everyone.  Historical, with a strong ethic for the love of mankind.  Wilberforce and his story will inspire people to stand for what they believe.  In the times we live in today, it is rare for people to stand up for what is right.  Wilberforce is an example of almost unwavering commitment to a cause.The world was better for his efforts, I think you will be better for seeing, Amazing Grace.

One of the reasons might be because I only watched it once but some movies, such as Amistad, take only one viewing to really leave an impression.  For me, I think one of the things that disappointed me was the lack of African-American actors and also, not enough was spent on the terrible aspects of the slave trade. I don't mean by that to say, horror filled scenes of the slave trade in action should have been shown except for maybe an example or two to give the audience somewhat of a feel for how horrible it really was. I know the movie was about William Wilberforce and his efforts to abolish the slave trade and, therefore, the story focused on him and rightly so.

654991,ATXL536YX71TR,B00005JPOE,"KerrLines ""&#34;Movies,Music,Theatre&#34;""","[24, 25]","36 of 37 people found the following review helpful: April 6, 2007Anyone who has seen AMISTAD or ROOTS needs to see the Michael Apted directed AMAZING GRACE which predates and fills in so much of the political and humanistic tug of war that existed concerning the awful dirty business of the African Slave Trade.Hollywood could not have conjectured a more true film than the actual true and inspiring life of William Wilberforce,a revered heroic figure in England,who,with the help of other abolitionists and political sympathizers,takes on the English Parliament and wins legislation to finally end the Slave Trade in 1807.This movie is SO significant because it is this piece of history that leads other European nations to follow suit in subsequent years and eventually to abolish the trade worldwide.Michael Apted has skillfully rescued this story from being another biopic,and has turned it into a sweeping epic that rings historically true.No finer actor could have been chosen to play Wilberforce than the Emmy Award winning Welsh marvel Ioan Gruffudd,pronounced YO-an Griffith( HORATIO HORNBLOWER,SOLOMON AND GAENOR,VERY ANNIE MARY).Gruffudd positively understands the heart and soul of Wilberforce,and delivers a tender yet dynamic knockout performance of this absolutely giant among men whose inner convictions and powerful and persuasive rhetoric eventually win over Parliament in a nearly twenty year life-and-death struggle.This film brings tremendously true and historical understanding of the political machine that was (and frankly still is) in place from 1785 to 1807.Historical figures argue and debate their opposing views while the lives of millions of innocent Africans and the fortunes and supremacies of national pride hang in the balance.The film moves swiftly and is not preachy or at all heavy-handed in any direction.It simply tells and honest and riveting true-to-life story.Some characters and events are combined together to compact the screenplay,but no truth is lost in the outcome.The film takes it's name from the famous 18th-century renowned hymn AMAZING GRACE,written by the Anglican minister John Newton,who had,years earlier,himself been an active and ardent participant in the selling of African flesh.John Newton is portrayed (a bit much like a crazy old celibate monk) by veteran actor Albert Finney in one of the smaller supporting supporting roles.Though much of what Newton says in the film is directly from his own memoirs,he was a married man,who,historically,valued his wife as his best friend.Now in his declining years,Newton,who has in later years been Rector of a London Church,is sought out by Wilberforce,who sat under Newton's pulpit as a child,to have the old minister help him in the cause of exposing the Slave Trade in all of it's ugliness.As was true in Newton's real life,Finney shows that this is the singlemost painful event in Newton's life thus making it next to impossible to discuss.The film directs Newton and Wilberforce over the course of the twenty years in order for the awful truth to come forth.Proof was necessary to persuade Parliament, and Newton was a key piece to passing the abolitionist legislation.Up and coming actor Benedict Cumberbatch accurately conveys William Pitt The Younger,in his boyhood friendship with Wilberforce and his subsequent rise to Prime Minister of England.What is inspiring about their relationship is that all of their political idealism comes to fruition showing the power and perseverance that these two young men had in fighting an age old institution that threatened to destabilize all of England.Other historical figures in this film such as Lord Tarlton (the ever amazing Ciaran Hinds)and Equiano (Youssou N'dour),Toby Jones as Lord Clarence (this actor seems to be able to play EVERYTHING!!!) and actors Michael Gambon as Sir Charles Fox do the utmost to bring this film to the heart and consciences of the world today.This film is simply NOT just another period piece drama or an ""inspirational"" film;rather it is an artfully scripted,deftly acted and directed and compelling piece of historical drama that all will benefit from viewing.Again,5 *****'s is not sufficient.May there be more films of such quality and substance made like this!Excellent companion films would be A RESPECTABLE TRADE,THE MIDDLE PASSAGE,AMISTAD,THE VOYAGE OF LA AMISTAD, MANSFIELD PARK (1999) and somewhat ROOTS.",5,The Amazing Battle to

654992,AYCJSA9HR7TKO,B00005JPOE,Kerry Walters,"[9, 18]","There are certain cinematic moments so absolutely perfect that they remain in one's memory, even if the film in which they occur isn't much to write home about.  So it is with ""Amazing Grace,"" a movie that manages to take a magnificent story--Wilberforce's long struggle to end slavery in Great Britain--and transform it into a rather tedious and unconvincing script.  Albert Finney's performance as John Newton, the slavetrader turned clergyman and hymn writer, and Michael Gambon's brilliant portrayal of Charles Fox, salvage the film.  Finney has only two scenes (plus a third silent walk-on), and Gambon, although in several scenes, probably has no more than 5 total minutes of speaking time.  But their performances are breath-taking:  Finney as the conscience-tortured ex-slaver, and Gambon as the cynical but wise legislator.Other performances in the film fall short, some of them because the script, written by Stephen Knight is so bad.  Veteran character actor Nicholas Farrell, for example, does his best in his role as Dr. Henry Thorton, but the scriptwriter doesn't give him much to go on.  Benedict Cumberbatch puts in a decent performance as William Pitt, but even he can't pull off the bathetic death scene with which the script encumbers him.Sadly, however, the very worst performance must go to Ioan Gruffudd, who plays Wilberforce.  Gruffudd's talents in the film veer toward loud melodrama rather than subtlety (a surprise, because he's given quite admirable performances in other movies).  In his hands, Wilberforce comes across as both unsympathetic and implausible.In short, a bad, sometimes mawkish script; lackluster performances; and miscasted leading man.  The film had the potential, given its inspiring story, to be as great as (for example) ""Chariots of Fire.""  But it fell far short of that.

Sadler""","[3, 3]","Amazing Grace was a superb depiction of one man's over 30 year struggle to end the British Empire's lucrative slave trade. William Wilberforce was a young man who came to his own understanding of the immorality of the ongoing practice of enslaving other people. He was raised in a rich trade family, and had no need to work himself. He was exposed to the best of everything; the best food, the best clothes, opportunities for schooling including Oxford, continual parties and entertainment. Yet in the midst of growing up, he was exposed by a Methodist uncle and aunt to the great religious speakers (and practitioners) of that faith. Wilberforce came to the realization of the need to devote his life to something good. His friends including William Pitt Jr. encouraged him to spend his life in Parliament fighting for a cause, rather than retiring his place in Parliament to become a preacher or a religious hermit. Wilberforce had always been a kind young man who hated to see the mistreatment of animals and other human beings of all classes, so when his friends showed him the ugly side of the British Empire's wealth, that was based on the enslavement of people from Africa who were then sent to the Americas, he quickly chose to devote his life and time to ending this horrific trade.This movie eloquently demonstrates not only the many obstacles Wilberforce had to contend with, but also the length of time it took him to achieve his goal...the passage of a bill that made the trade of shipping slaves illegal in Great Britain. Thirty years of work by Wilberforce and those who work with him took its toll on his health. This movie above all is a testament to the need to endure to the end that this great man demonstrated so well.I had read the book on this man, and wanted to see the movie. My husband had not been interested in this though I had told him about this man and his great efforts. During the course of the movie, my husband went from paying attention to his photography work, to paying attention to the movie. Afterwards he exclaimed that this was one of the best historial dramas he had ever seen. This from a man who prefers Dirty Harry movies and war movies. The acting was impeccable as always from known British actors, many of who performed in small but great support roles. Iaon Gruffudd, who most Americans know from the commercial 'Fantastic Four' series, was outstanding as Wilberforce.Don't think that a historical drama has to be dry and boring. This one is anything but. For one thing, Wilberforce was known to be one of the best, if not the best, political speaker of his time. His eloquence on the floor of Parliament and in his own writings, made him required reading over here in the U.S. by Franklin, Jefferson, LIncoln, and other well-known men of our own. They considered his acts, acts of supreme courage (which they were). He also had a huge sense of humor and timing, and was quick on his feet and could put down the highest ranking Lords (one of which was the King's own fat son). He and William Pitt complemented one another to great effect in Parliament, and they were practical joke players who would aid and abet in setting up those who needed to be taken down a few pegs.

654995,A26KIF01GEUXBT,B00005JPOE,Kyle Pratt,"[10, 10]","While there is romance in this movie, it is not a romance, nor is it a cute costume drama.  William Wilberforce came to be known as the keeper of the Britain's conscience.  This movie shows us his struggle against slavery in the British Empire.The title of the movie comes from John Newton's famous hymn, Amazing Grace. Newton was a slave trader early in his life but when confronted by God turned his ship around and released the slaves he held.  While Newton was a friend of Wilberforce and is a part of this movie, the focus of the movie is William Wilberfore, (Ioan Gruffudd) who, when confronted by that same God, spent years working to abolish slavery and improve the life of man and beast.One reviewer has argued at length that Wilberforce was not a saint.  All who follow the call of God are saints, but they are also human and imperfect.  Wilberforce was both saint and sinner, but because he was not afraid to follow the call of God countless humans and animals had better lives.  In addition to his struggle against slavery Wilberforce worked to establish charity schools for children and also founded the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which continues to this day as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Britain.A few reviewers have stated the movie should have had more Africans or dealt more with the African experience, but the movie was not about Africa or Africans, it was about the parliamentary fight of William Wilberforce to make slavery illegal in the British Empire.Recommendation: As I mentioned in the title of this review the movie has history, drama and even a bit of romance.

In this film, Albert Finney plays the former slave trader who once carried slaves across the sea. After turning from the slave trade, he became a minister in Britain. William Wilburforce grew up in his congregation and became a member of the British Parliament where he would contend for the abolition of slavery for 20 years.The film Amazing Grace is based on a true story and was released on the bicentennial anniversary of the abolition of slavery in Britain. The movie depicts the passion and diligence of those who sought freedom and an end to injustice for those who could not speak for themselves. Albert Finney portrays a humbled man who is haunted by the 20,000 human souls that he harmed.The movie also has a touch of romance for Wilburforce. His friends try their hand at matchmaking and introduce him to a pretty redhead who is also an abolitionist. In spite of their initial resistance to the idea, the two find common ground and marry. The movie switches back and forth from different times in the life of Wilburforce, from youth to when he is older, which can get a little confusing at times. On a historical note, the close friend of Wilburforce, William Pitt, still holds the record as being the youngest Prime Minister in Britain's history.

655008,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B00005JPOE,Mark Baker,"[6, 6]","The title of this movie threw me.  When I first heard about this movie, I figured it would be about John Newton who wrote the famous hymn.  Instead, it tells the story of William Wilberforce, the man who led the fight to end slavery in England.  The hymn of the title is William's favorite hymn and shows up a few times in the soundtrack.  Still, I don't completely get why the movie got this title.  Either way, that's my only complaint.William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) was a member of Parliament during the late 1700's.  He hadn't been in politics too long when God got a hold of him.  While he was good at politics, he felt pulled to devote his life to God.  But through the encourage of his friends, especially Prime Minister to be William Pitt (Benedict Cumberbatch) and preacher John Newton (Albert Finney), he found another calling for his life - leading the fight to end slavery in the British Empire.This movie begins in 1797, and in a series of flashbacks, tells the story of William beginning his struggle to end slavery.  In 1797, his poor health and constant defeats lead him to almost give up his calling.  Will he stop or keep fighting?William Wilberforce was a deeply committed Christian, and that influenced much of his life.  But don't let that fact scare you away from this wonderful film.  Christianity is an ever present part of the story, but the movie never preaches.  And, unlike many Christian movies, this one is well written, acted, and produced.I often have a hard time getting into period movies, and this one was no exception.  But once I figure out who everyone was, I got lost in the story.  The movie brings in the larger historical context, making it that much richer.  And the costumes and sets are wonderful.  Everyone in the cast does a great job.  Obviously, the movie is mostly series, but a few comic moments help lighten the mood.  They really took me by surprise and made me laugh out loud.Mainly through words, this movie depicts the harsh realities that were the slave trade.  Frankly, this made the horror all the more real to me.  There are two uses of the ""n"" word.  They are jarring.  While historically accurate, I think their use was intended to jar us.As I watched the story unfold, I couldn't help but notice how little has changed in politics in the last 200 years.  Frankly, this gave me hope that some of the issues of today will eventually be resolved despite how it looks from year to year.This is an inspiring movie.  We need more men like William Wilberforce today who will fight, not because it is politically expedient, but because it is right.",5,What One Person Can Do,1194912000,"11 13, 2007",2007,2608,"['title', 'movie', 'threw', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'movie', 'figured', 'would', 'be', 'John', 'Newton', 'who', 'wrote', 'famous', 'hymn', 'Instead', 'story', 'William', 'Wilberforce', 'man', 'who', 'led', 'fight', 'end', 'slavery', 'England', 'hymn', 'title', 'William', 'favorite', 'hymn', 'up', 'few', 'times', 'soundtrack', 'Still', 'do', ""n't"", 'completely', 'get', 'why', 'movie', 'got', 'title', 'way', 'only', 'complaint.William', 'Wilberforce', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'was', 'member', 'Parliament', 'late', '1700', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'politics', 'too', 'long', 'when', 'God', 'got', 'hold', 'was', 'good', 'politics', 'felt', 'pulled', 'devote', 'life', 'God', 'encourage', 'friends', 'especially', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'be', 'William', 'Pitt', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'John', 'Newton', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'found', 'calling', 'life', 'leading', 'fight', 'end', 'slavery', 'British', 'Empire.This', 'movie', '1797', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'story', 'William', 'beginning', 'struggle', 'end', 'slavery', '1797', 'poor', 'health', 'constant', 'defeats', 'lead', 'almost', 'give', 'up', 'calling', 'Will', 'stop', 'keep', 'fighting', 'William', 'Wilberforce', 'was', 'deeply', 'committed', 'Christian', 'influenced', 'much', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'fact', 'scare', 'away', 'wonderful', 'film', 'Christianity', 'ever', 'present', 'part', 'story', 'movie', 'never', 'preaches', 'many', 'Christian', 'movies', 'one', 'well', 'written', 'acted', 'produced.I', 'often', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'period', 'movies', 'one', 'was', 'exception', 'once', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'everyone', 'was', 'got', 'lost', 'story', 'movie', 'larger', 'historical', 'context', 'making', 'much', 'richer', 'costumes', 'sets', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Everyone', 'cast', 'great', 'job', 'Obviously', 'movie', 'mostly', 'series', 'few', 'comic', 'moments', 'help', 'lighten', 'mood', 'really', 'took', 'surprise', 'made', 'loud.Mainly', 'words', 'movie', 'harsh', 'realities', 'were', 'slave', 'trade', 'Frankly', 'made', 'horror', 'more', 'real', 'are', 'two', 'uses', 'n', 'word', 'are', 'jarring', 'historically', 'accurate', 'think', 'use', 'was', 'intended', 'jar', 'us.As', 'watched', 'story', 'unfold', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'how', 'little', 'changed', 'politics', 'last', '200', 'years', 'Frankly', 'gave', 'hope', 'issues', 'today', 'will', 'eventually', 'be', 'resolved', 'how', 'year', 'year.This', 'inspiring', 'movie', 'need', 'more', 'men', 'William', 'Wilberforce', 'today', 'who', 'will', 'fight', 'not', 'politically', 'expedient', 'right']",Amazing Grace [Theatrical Release]

655010,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00005JPOE,Mark Turner,"[10, 10]","Many believe that the stories conceived by writers offer compelling tales that take us on journeys unimagined. There is some truth in this idea. But at the same time, there are journey's that men have taken in the past that offer themselves to compelling tales as well, offering more drama than imaginable. Such is the story of William Wilberforce.Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) was a 19th century politician whose views in Parliament were a bit unconventional for the times. As the tale beings, William has just lost his greatest political battle, an attempt to abolish the slave trade in the whole of the British kingdom. Succumbing to ill health, he has retreated to his cousin's home to recuperate. Along the way his cousin (and his wife) introduce William to a young woman who has similar viewpoints to his and who has been a staunch supporter of his beliefs. It is through their short courtship that William tells her the story of how he came to this point in his life.As his political career was beginning, Wilberforce hit a snag in the road. He was touched with a profound belief in God and considered a life as a minister turning his back on politics altogether. His friendship with one time classmate William Pitt the Younger (Benedict Cumberbatch) leads Pitt to coerce Wilberforce to learn more about the slave trade. Meeting in secret with those who have strived to have the cruelty of slavery brought into the public eye, Wilberforce is overcome with a belief that not only is it wrong but that it must be stopped.At one point in the story, The Duke Of Clarence (Toby Jones) offers to put up one of his slaves to offset a bet during a card game with Wilberforce. While he turns down the offer, he is encouraged by his friend to sing for fellow members of Parliament in the club where the game was taking place. The song he chooses is ""Amazing Grace"" which was written by a man Wilberforce is familiar with, an ex-sea captain named John Newton (Albert Finney) who has since retired and who wrote the song while overpowered with grief for the atrocities he had seen with the slaves.The story continues, showing the ups and downs of politics in the 19th century and the battles that Wilberforce and his followers went through in their attempts to change a system in place for many years, an economic whirlwind that brought money into the country but at what cost. It is the drama of mans inhumanity to man and one mans attempt to change what is accepted and make it unacceptable.Gruffudd does a wonderful job as Wilberforce, making him not only a noble person to look up to but a human one as well. The character is filled with passion for his beliefs and Gruffudd brings this out in each and every scene. The supporting cast is equally adept at bringing the story off of the pages of history and making it an inviting trip into history that many are unaware of.The song ""Amazing Grace"" may be only a starting point for many, bringing them round to the truth behind it. But the movie ""Amazing Grace"", while touching on a depressing subject, is an uplifting tale of a man who changed history for the better. It's a movie that's worth watching with the whole family.",4,TRUTH BEHIND THE WORDS,1200700800,"01 19, 2008",2008,3171,"['Many', 'believe', 'stories', 'conceived', 'writers', 'offer', 'compelling', 'tales', 'take', 'journeys', 'unimagined', 'truth', 'idea', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'journey', 'men', 'have', 'taken', 'past', 'offer', 'compelling', 'tales', 'as', 'well', 'offering', 'more', 'drama', 'imaginable', 'Such', 'story', 'William', 'Wilberforce.Wilberforce', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'was', '19th', 'century', 'politician', 'views', 'Parliament', 'were', 'bit', 'unconventional', 'times', 'tale', 'beings', 'William', 'just', 'lost', 'greatest', 'political', 'battle', 'attempt', 'abolish', 'slave', 'trade', 'whole', 'British', 'kingdom', 'Succumbing', 'ill', 'health', 'retreated', 'cousin', 'home', 'recuperate', 'way', 'cousin', 'wife', 'introduce', 'William', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'similar', 'viewpoints', 'who', 'been', 'staunch', 'supporter', 'beliefs', 'short', 'courtship', 'William', 'story', 'how', 'came', 'point', 'life.As', 'political', 'career', 'was', 'beginning', 'Wilberforce', 'hit', 'snag', 'road', 'was', 'touched', 'profound', 'belief', 'God', 'considered', 'life', 'minister', 'turning', 'back', 'politics', 'altogether', 'friendship', 'one', 'time', 'classmate', 'William', 'Pitt', 'Younger', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'Pitt', 'coerce', 'Wilberforce', 'learn', 'more', 'slave', 'trade', 'Meeting', 'secret', 'who', 'have', 'strived', 'have', 'cruelty', 'slavery', 'brought', 'public', 'eye', 'Wilberforce', 'overcome', 'belief', 'not', 'only', 'wrong', 'must', 'be', 'stopped.At', 'one', 'point', 'story', 'Duke', 'Clarence', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'put', 'up', 'one', 'slaves', 'offset', 'bet', 'card', 'game', 'Wilberforce', 'down', 'offer', 'encouraged', 'friend', 'sing', 'fellow', 'members', 'Parliament', 'club', 'where', 'game', 'was', 'taking', 'place', 'song', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'was', 'written', 'man', 'Wilberforce', 'familiar', 'ex-sea', 'captain', 'named', 'John', 'Newton', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'who', 'retired', 'who', 'wrote', 'song', 'overpowered', 'grief', 'atrocities', 'had', 'seen', 'slaves.The', 'story', 'showing', 'ups', 'downs', 'politics', '19th', 'century', 'battles', 'Wilberforce', 'followers', 'went', 'attempts', 'change', 'system', 'place', 'many', 'years', 'economic', 'whirlwind', 'brought', 'money', 'country', 'what', 'cost', 'drama', 'mans', 'inhumanity', 'man', 'one', 'mans', 'attempt', 'change', 'what', 'accepted', 'make', 'unacceptable.Gruffudd', 'wonderful', 'job', 'Wilberforce', 'making', 'not', 'only', 'noble', 'person', 'look', 'up', 'human', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'character', 'filled', 'passion', 'beliefs', 'Gruffudd', 'out', 'scene', 'supporting', 'cast', 'equally', 'adept', 'bringing', 'story', 'pages', 'history', 'making', 'inviting', 'trip', 'history', 'many', 'are', 'unaware', 'song', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'starting', 'point', 'many', 'bringing', 'round', 'truth', 'movie', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'touching', 'depressing', 'subject', 'uplifting', 'tale', 'man', 'who', 'changed', 'history', 'better', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'whole', 'family']",Amazing Grace [Theatrical Release]

That is exactly what Amazing Grace is. Amazing Grace is a moving, inspirational, true story of what one man and a righteous cause can accomplish. Add on to the story itself some terrific acting and excellent production values and you get one of the best films of 2007.Ioan Gruffudd gives an outstanding (for which he should have been Oscar worthy) performance as William Wilberforce. He is intense in the scenes where he is passionate and he is just as believable in the scenes where he is disgruntled. Not to mention him and Romola Garai share chemistry as a romantic couple and that he also is highly believable as the best friend of the Prime Minister. This is Grufford's best work to date and I hope to see more work of this caliber in the future.The supporting cast is top-notch as well. Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent as Prime Minister Pitt and, as I wrote above, he shares a lot of chemistry with Gruffudd. The same is true of Romola Garai who plays the wife of Wilberforce. She is convincing as a figure whose passionate views could make Wilberforce fall in love and continue a struggle he has lost faith in. Albert Finney makes a few dabbles into the film as the man behind the song, John Newton. He is excellent as the guilt ridden slave ship captain turned preacher. Michael Gambon is also excellent as one of Wilberforce's biggest supporters in Parliament. Roundign out this amazing cast is the villains: Ciar&aacute;n Hinds and the ever excellent Toby Jones.The film's script is near perfect. The story is a true one which proves that fact is, as always, better then fiction. The story never delves too deeply into sentimentally but keeps the story's emotional power in firm check. The scenes of debate are tense and even at times frustrating. The only fault of the writing is the lack of a point of view from the slaves themselves. We are given only a few brief glimpses into their world and the basis of the film is given to us only in those glimpses and some of the dialog. Yet the writing supplements the acting and by the end of the film the viewer(at least the audience I saw this film with in theatres when it came out)cheering and applauding the final vote in Parliament.The production values of the film are high and impressive. The film manages to take you in and bring back to a distant and gone time and place. The world as it was then comes alive in a way that few other films manage to do. This is evident throughout the sets and costumes. Also there is the score by David Arnold who creates a score that captures all the emotional power of the story and is the composers best work to date.It is a shame that other, lesser films hovershadowed this film in both box office dollars and in the minds of audiences while it was in theatres. This a film that leaves you believing that with the right cause and a passionate person to back it and nurture it, anything is possible.

Like ""Gandhi"", the compelling and noted dates and happenings are melded to represent, with as much dramatic interest as possible, the essence of the man and the fight.  The want for abolition of slavery has caused conflict all over the world, between many cultures, since the beginning of time and this particular effort by Wilberforce stands out because the time and country it took place.  The English were a much more powerful colonial power than today and the suppression of the native peoples of the countries they ruled was harsh and bordered on indenture more than actual until WWII.  But this could have been so much worse had Wilberforce not sought to permanently outlaw the trade and profit from the enslavement of human beings, regardless of origin.  The law, like the US Emancipation Proclamation, had little teeth until the 20th century whereas they lost a great majority of their colonies and we had the Civil Rights movement.This movie is hearfelt and dramatic and does justice to the facts enough to get the meaning and story across.What impresses Metaldiva is the irony of the hymn ""Amazing Grace"" being a sort of funeral anthem for the rebel south/secessionists and racial terrorists to this day in the US. But all through the years, it was actually an anthem written by a parson (and former slave trader) to express his change in heart and mind for the respect and freedom of those enslaved persons, in his case Africans.Metaldiva Sez: Entertainment and learning can go hand in hand, in this case it is a lovely historical telling of a subject that is more in the minds of people today than has been in many way.

He faced numerous obstacles in his quest and suffered the strains in body, mind, and spirit, yet ultimately succeeded.Unfortunately, the script writers chose to scimp on events in Mr. Wilberforce's life that gave his life depth. Three examples should suffice.Under the orders of his physician, he used opium for years to combat ""colitis."" Opium addiction, like modern narcotic addiction, can be devastating. Yet the only effect the script writers felt important to highlight was Mr. Wilberforce's desire to give up opium in order to keep his mind clear for the coming battles over the slave trade. His mind was clouded? The movie never showed this effect. Was his life or relationships affected in any other way? The movie is silent.The scenes showing Mr. Wilberforce's friendship with Mr. Pitt early in their careers are wonderful. Showing them race through the gardens like young lads before Mr. Pitt rose to the post of Prime Minister was a stroke of brilliance. However, simply noting that they had become estranged, as they remarked each other at Mr. Wilberforce's wedding, did not do justice to the depth of their friendship.Why would Lord Tarleton have taken excpetion to Mr. Wilberforce's use of the term ""the people"" when he presented his anti-slave trade petition to parliament? The movie only hints at the reason, and it was much more complex than Lord Tarleton having fought in the Revolutionary War against the Americans and having lost two fingers. Since the movie presents Lord Tarleton as the principal person who thwarted Mr. Wilberforce's attempts to abolish the slave trade, presenting his complex character as a simple caricature diminished Mr. Wilberforce's achievement.In summary: A wonderful story about an extraordinary man.

M Simon ""El Simon Asombroso""","[5, 5]","Actually, let's give Michael Apted's ""Amazing Grace"" 4.5 stars and let's look at the strengths of the film first.First, when you start with a plot about the abolition of slavery in the British Empire, and intertwine, accurately, historic characters such as Fox, Pitt the Younger, Tarelton, and the Duke of Clarence, you are starting with a strong story.  Focus on the main character--MP William Wilberforce and his indefatigable efforts, and you have a winner.Next, work with the copious records and documents to stay historically faithful.  Throw in Wilberforce's strong relationship with John Newton, a former slave ship captain turned cleric, and author of the title hymn.  How can you miss?This film's greatest virtue besides the great historic tale is the fine acting. Ioan Gruffudd as Wilberforce is supplemented by many of the finest talents of British Cinema including Albert Finney as Newton, Rufus Sewell, Nicholas Farrell, and Toby Jones. The script crackles, allowing them all to display their talents.If the film has a technical weak point, it is it's odd use of flashbacks, flash forwards and strange ""two years later"" time increments.  It's a little hard to follow, but not unwatchable at all.If there is a historic weak point of the film, it has to be ""Where's Wesley?""  John Wesley, founder of the Methodist Church was mainly remembered when he died in 1803 as a premier fighter against slavery in the UK.  Living contemporaneously with Wilberforce, not even giving him a mention seems a major historic omission.But, otherwise, great, inspirational entertainment.

Lane,"[0, 0]","I was familiar with the story of William Wilberforce from what I read of him in Peter Marshall's From Sea to Shining Sea, and remember thinking at the time that Mr. Wilberforce should be better known for the incredible work he did to abolish the slave trade in England. It was a story of courage and sacrifice, and it seemed strange that I had never heard it before. The character of William also fascinated me. So when I saw this yesterday I literally pounced on it, knowing it had to be great. It was great, though it focused more on what Williams faith produced than on his faith itself. Beautifully filmed and thouhtfully written, the little known story of a compassionate and strong-willed young man who changed history was brought to life with an all British cast. The settings and costumes were good, and the acters were well chosen. The array of eccentric characters made it seem a bit like Dickens. Wilberforce himself was an odd man, with poor people he didn't know crowding his dining room at lunch time and all kinds of animals running around. His friend Thomas Clarkston caught my eye every time he came on screen. He didn't have many lines and never changed his expression, but Rufus Sewell can do more with a wistful, stoney glare than most actors can do with a dozen speeches. An intrigueing, dark character, greying, sandy hair swaying in the breeze beneath a scare-crow hat . . . And Pitt, another friend of Wilberforce, is convincing in a quiet way. Would watch it again just to hear his accent. The special features are as rich as the movie. Actor interviws, a music video by Chris Tomlin, and a section where a young modern-day abolitionist speaks out on slavery today. Politics often stand in the way of justice, now, as then, and this movie reminds us not to quit fighting for what's right when the tide of political sway is against you. ""If not you, who?

655051,A1XZJ32DJS8YV2,B00005JPOE,"R. M. Williams ""just an avid reader""","[2, 4]","On the surface it is a historical movie about the work of William Wilberforce against the English participation in the African slave trade at the turn of the 19th century.But i think that the writer's had much more to say about English society than this, things that are still important and ought to be considered.Their deeper criticism is about the hierarchical nature of English society, the rulers and the ruled, the elite landowning and servant owning class and the masses of people toiling in the farms, fields and factories. There are several places where this criticism breaks the surface of the movie: the scene where the servant steps over the fence and sits in the field with Wilberforce and together contemplate spider webs, the scene in Parliament where the Whig opposition leader asks Wilberforce ""the people?"", and the analogy of America opening the bottle of revolution and France pouring it out.The defenders of America slavery in the 19thC took the issue of the hierarchical nature of society very much to heart, Robert Dabney in defense of virginia, stated boldly that without a natural hierarchy and an elite of rulers, and an underclass of slaves, Christian society was doomed to a radical equalitarianism stemming from the French revolution's atheistic call of arms.Wilberforce himself was an independent, but he supported wholeheartedly the Tory administration of his friend William Pitt, elements of this friendship make up a substantial thread in Amazing Grace. It is the Tory flurtation with French revolutionary thought that gets Wilberforce and others in trouble during the war years with France. The movie firmly takes a stand not only against the slave trade, for the moral improvement program of Wilberforce, but for the gradual flattening of English society into a meritocratic democracy rather than the traditional Whiggish view of elitism, as the movie so aptly sums it up near the end in the term-""Nobilis oblige"".What i find curious is that only one review here hints at the larger criticism of society that this movie attempts. Slavery is not a burning issue in our society, but wage-slavery (as the wobblies pointed out) is much the same thing, elitism and a heritary hierarchy without reference to individual achievement is a big problem in England and an increasing problem in Western culture in general and the US in particular. If you look at the movie in this way it becomes not so much a criticism of a form of economics which rightly died in the mid 19thC, but part of an ongoing struggle for genuine participation in political and social life for all people, not only the ruling classes.I think that the writers avoided strongly pursuing this theme because the current climate of the natural audience of the movie, Christians are far more aligned with Whiggish theories of history and economics then classical liberal Tory type views and they really couldnt sell the movie to this group if they had made the elements stronger. but the fact that in Christ there is no Jew nor Gentile, no rich or poor, the theme of the field scene about spider webs and such, is one of the greatest criticisms of a hierarchical society that mankind has ever believed.It is a good movie, just look a bit deeper than a historical piece about Wilberforce and the ending of the british slave trade. it is an amazing and productive period of history and i'm glad someone was able to make a somewhat popular movie about a few of the pieces of the puzzle that is the Whig-Tory 18-19thC dance.",5,more than a simple historical movie,1195516800,"11 20, 2007",2007,3512,"['surface', 'historical', 'movie', 'work', 'William', 'Wilberforce', 'English', 'participation', 'African', 'slave', 'trade', 'turn', '19th', 'century.But', 'i', 'think', 'writer', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'say', 'English', 'society', 'things', 'are', 'still', 'important', 'ought', 'be', 'considered.Their', 'deeper', 'criticism', 'hierarchical', 'nature', 'English', 'society', 'rulers', 'ruled', 'elite', 'landowning', 'servant', 'owning', 'class', 'masses', 'people', 'toiling', 'farms', 'fields', 'factories', 'are', 'several', 'places', 'where', 'criticism', 'surface', 'movie', 'scene', 'where', 'servant', 'steps', 'fence', 'sits', 'field', 'Wilberforce', 'together', 'contemplate', 'spider', 'webs', 'scene', 'Parliament', 'where', 'Whig', 'opposition', 'leader', 'Wilberforce', 'people', 'analogy', 'America', 'opening', 'bottle', 'revolution', 'France', 'pouring', 'out.The', 'defenders', 'America', 'slavery', '19thC', 'took', 'issue', 'hierarchical', 'nature', 'society', 'very', 'much', 'heart', 'Robert', 'Dabney', 'defense', 'virginia', 'stated', 'boldly', 'natural', 'hierarchy', 'elite', 'rulers', 'underclass', 'slaves', 'Christian', 'society', 'was', 'doomed', 'radical', 'equalitarianism', 'stemming', 'French', 'revolution', 'atheistic', 'call', 'arms.Wilberforce', 'was', 'independent', 'supported', 'wholeheartedly', 'Tory', 'administration', 'friend', 'William', 'Pitt', 'elements', 'friendship', 'make', 'up', 'substantial', 'thread', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'Tory', 'flurtation', 'French', 'revolutionary', 'thought', 'Wilberforce', 'others', 'trouble', 'war', 'years', 'France', 'movie', 'firmly', 'stand', 'not', 'only', 'slave', 'trade', 'moral', 'improvement', 'program', 'Wilberforce', 'gradual', 'flattening', 'English', 'society', 'meritocratic', 'democracy', 'rather', 'traditional', 'Whiggish', 'view', 'elitism', 'movie', 'so', 'aptly', 'sums', 'up', 'end', 'term-', 'Nobilis', 'oblige', '.What', 'i', 'find', 'curious', 'only', 'one', 'review', 'here', 'hints', 'larger', 'criticism', 'society', 'movie', 'Slavery', 'not', 'burning', 'issue', 'society', 'wage-slavery', 'wobblies', 'pointed', 'out', 'much', 'same', 'thing', 'elitism', 'heritary', 'hierarchy', 'reference', 'individual', 'achievement', 'big', 'problem', 'England', 'increasing', 'problem', 'Western', 'culture', 'general', 'US', 'particular', 'look', 'movie', 'way', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'criticism', 'form', 'economics', 'rightly', 'died', 'mid', '19thC', 'part', 'ongoing', 'struggle', 'genuine', 'participation', 'political', 'social', 'life', 'people', 'not', 'only', 'ruling', 'classes.I', 'think', 'writers', 'avoided', 'strongly', 'pursuing', 'theme', 'current', 'climate', 'natural', 'audience', 'movie', 'Christians', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'aligned', 'Whiggish', 'theories', 'history', 'economics', 'then', 'classical', 'liberal', 'Tory', 'type', 'views', 'really', 'couldnt', 'sell', 'movie', 'group', 'had', 'made', 'elements', 'stronger', 'fact', 'Christ', 'Jew', 'Gentile', 'rich', 'poor', 'theme', 'field', 'scene', 'spider', 'webs', 'such', 'one', 'greatest', 'criticisms', 'hierarchical', 'society', 'mankind', 'ever', 'believed.It', 'good', 'movie', 'just', 'look', 'bit', 'deeper', 'historical', 'piece', 'Wilberforce', 'ending', 'british', 'slave', 'trade', 'amazing', 'productive', 'period', 'history', 'i', ""'m"", 'glad', 'someone', 'was', 'able', 'make', 'somewhat', 'popular', 'movie', 'few', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'Whig-Tory', '18-19thC', 'dance']",Amazing Grace [Theatrical Release]
655052,A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ,B00005JPOE,Robert Blake,"[16, 50]","""Amazing Grace"" is not the story about the classic hymn as the ads and title lead you to believe, it instead attempts to tell the story of English abolitionist William Wilberforce. Wilberforce's struggle to dismantle the horrific slave trade in Britain is a story worthy of a film, but unfortunately ""Amazing Grace"" plays more like a crawling, unfocused costume drama that comes across more as a bad TV movie than a serious motion picture. It also unsuccessfully juggles multiple story arcs, creating a fractured narrative that makes the film lose any real power or punch. There are good scenes in this movie, and some decent production values, but it never fully engages the viewer. The film also makes the mistake of forgetting a crucial element of the story: The slaves.The movie begins with a fascinating scene where Wilberforce shows his compassion for all of God's creatures by stopping a man on a side of the road who whips a black horse, the narrative then jumps to some of Wilberforce's colleagues trying to make a love connection between Wilberforce and a pretty English girl who has followed his abolotinist work for years. It is here where the jumping back and fourth begins as the film decides not to keep a focused narrative and instead employ a flashback technique where the resolutions of certain story arcs are revealed before they even begin. We meet some interesting characters, including a former slave ship captain who wrote the hymn ""Amazing Grace"" and is haunted by the memories of his former trade. He gets the best dialogue in the movie, and you wonder, indeed, why the movie isn't about him.Director Michael Apted, best known for the 007 film ""The World Is Not Enough,"" surprisingly exchanges power and impact for cheesy romance and cornball scenes between friends. Like the films ""Luther"" and ""Alexander,"" Apted here shows a lot but tells too little. There are some good, intense scenes where the British MPs debate the issue of slavery and the economic importance it held at the time, but the very issue of slavery itself feels pushed back in a film which decides to be timid and safe about the subject. Wilberforce tours a slave ship, and we see a few chains on the roof, but we never meet the slaves, we never actually see their plight as in Steven Spielberg's ""Amistad."" There is only one major black character in the film, and he's only given a few lines in two scenes and then we simply discover he died after publishing his memoirs. After that, the African slaves Wilmberforce is fighting for have no identity, they are, as with the former captain, ghosts.The character of Wilmberforce is also never treated like a flesh and blood person, a brilliant man pushing against the status quo. Oh there are classic moments of fist clenching and shouting, but Wilmberforce is reduced to a cardboard character, a cartoon who only says what we expect him to say. Even his faith, a major theme in a film obviously meant to cater to Christian audiences (Chris Tomlin even sings the title song), is never explored or even convincingly portrayed. How Wilmberforce really find God? We never know, it's all summed up in one corny scene where he sits in a field looking at the sky and observes the beauty of a spider-web, after that the rest of the movie reduced the importance of Wilmberforce's faith to just a few, typical lines like ""we are all equal in the eyes of God."" Can't disagree with the notion, but we're never convinced of the passion or fever of this man's beliefs. Instead of exploring where Wilmberforce's faith comes from, the script feels as if it just had to randomly throw in the word ""God"" in every few lines just to remind viewers this is a religious-friendly movie. But those seriously interested in Christian ideas in the fight against slavery will find nothing deep or profound. Valuable space is given to a very unconvincing love story between Wilmberforce and the woman he eventually marries. Their dialogue is suitable for a bad soap opera and we never feel as if these are actually two connected people bound together by anything. Even the films villains have little to no identity, they are simply qeued for every Parliament scene and then disappear in the background.We shouldn't expect movies to be historical guides, those who really want to inform themselves should go to the local public library instead, but the best historical films also take history seriously and with at least some detail. ""Amazing Grace"" simply skips around themes and events without showing their impact or importance. The American Revolution is mentioned and glorified (of course), but it never goes beyond that. Did Wilmberforce have any opinions on America's own slave culture? The Haitian Revolution is at least mentioned in one quick line, but you never know what Wilmberforce thought about it. Thomas Jefferson himself was terrified of the Haitian Revolution because it symbolized the ability of the slaves to rebel and even take power, Jefferson is only mentioned in passing in the film as suspected of corresponding with Wilmberforce eventhough they had completely different ideas of freedom for the slaves. The ending of the film is also a little tricky, I understand Apted has to give the audience what they want, a heroic, triumphant ending for the hero, but the way slavery is abolished is explained in a rapid, muddled narrative. Of course the screenwriters had to find a way around the fact that Britain abolished slavery more for the purpose of hitting the French and American economies hard, not because Wilmberforce convinced the government of his moral battle.In the end ""Amazing Grace"" is a bad exercise in anglophile cinema, this is the kind of movie directors like Spike Lee and actors like Danny Globver must feel frustrated about. Glover himself has been trying to launch a film on the Haitian Revolution for years, but whenever he pitches the script around Hollywood, the answer according to him, is always the same: ""Where are the white characters?"" That is not to say ""Amazing Grace"" is some sort of racist film, it has too much of a good heart for that, but in trying to reduce Wilmberforce's struggle to a soapy message movie, the film loses sight of its subject and even its spiritual content. Even the title is not done justice, because the real story of ""Amazing Grace"" is surely a film worth making.

655057,AJV5NWT37PA7Z,B00005JPOE,Roger Boon,"[4, 4]","I would place this film amongst the most powerful I have ever seen in a long life of cinema going.The script was brilliantly tight and barely a word was wasted. The sets were very authentic and cost I heard a reported 30 million. Beyond the walls of Wilberforce's home the world of London was presented in a dark and brooding manner which reinforced the sense of the legitimised evil that Wilberforce and his associates were fighting.The mainly ensemble British acting was of the highest order. Outstanding performances amongst others were given by Ioan Gruffudd who superbly conveyed the complexities of Wilberforce's character, Michael Gambon,Rufus Sewell,Benjamin Cumberbatch, and Romola Garai with a superb cameo of the reformed and redeemed slaver, John Newton, by Albert Finney.Balance was given by recognition of the important role of Oloudaqh Equiano played by Youssou N'Dorr.However, some historical license was taken in order to create dramatic effect.This included the Duke of Clarence sitting in the House of Commons and James Fox,one of the greatest orators and reformers of the day, giving the final paean of praise to Wilberforce when in history he had already died.Never mix politics and religion we are told, yet the film does it successfully by embellishing the issue with a real wit and humour.The power of the film lies to a great extent in its understatement which makes it very British and it will be interesting to see how well it does in the States.The deliberately diverted visit of MP's and their consorts to the moored slave ship was a metaphor of this. The power of the misery was conveyed without it being completely thrust in the face. The final tribute to Wilberforce was another notable example of the power of the use of a few chosen words rather than many.The film was both moving and inspirational. In this era of the quick fix, it reminded us, as do the lives of Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu,of the importance of never giving up in the fight for a more just and humane world. Evil prospers when good men and women do nothing -but we need to do it again and again and again. There are more slaves in the world today than there were at the time of abolition and I trust this film will inspire another generation to continue the struggle.For those who want a more politically correct revisionist view of history and who cry paternalism, it needs to be emphasised that Wilberforce and his supporters took on the might of the political and economic establishment of the day and won. Yes he was a compassionate man but he was also a great champion of justice and justice above all requires that we see those who we are trying to help as equals.This is an outstanding piece of film making that does justice to the achievement of Wilberforce and his associates",5,A truly inspirational film,1259193600,"11 26, 2009",2009,2791,"['would', 'place', 'film', 'most', 'powerful', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'long', 'life', 'cinema', 'going.The', 'script', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'tight', 'barely', 'word', 'was', 'wasted', 'sets', 'were', 'very', 'authentic', 'cost', 'heard', 'reported', '30', 'million', 'Beyond', 'walls', 'Wilberforce', 'home', 'world', 'London', 'was', 'presented', 'dark', 'brooding', 'manner', 'reinforced', 'sense', 'legitimised', 'evil', 'Wilberforce', 'associates', 'were', 'fighting.The', 'mainly', 'ensemble', 'British', 'acting', 'was', 'highest', 'order', 'Outstanding', 'performances', 'amongst', 'others', 'were', 'given', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'who', 'superbly', 'conveyed', 'complexities', 'Wilberforce', 'character', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'Benjamin', 'Cumberbatch', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'superb', 'cameo', 'reformed', 'redeemed', 'slaver', 'John', 'Newton', 'Albert', 'Finney.Balance', 'was', 'given', 'recognition', 'important', 'role', 'Oloudaqh', 'Equiano', 'played', 'Youssou', ""N'Dorr.However"", 'historical', 'license', 'was', 'taken', 'order', 'create', 'dramatic', 'effect.This', 'included', 'Duke', 'Clarence', 'sitting', 'House', 'Commons', 'James', 'Fox', 'one', 'greatest', 'orators', 'reformers', 'day', 'giving', 'final', 'paean', 'praise', 'Wilberforce', 'when', 'history', 'had', 'already', 'died.Never', 'mix', 'politics', 'religion', 'are', 'told', 'yet', 'film', 'successfully', 'embellishing', 'issue', 'real', 'wit', 'humour.The', 'power', 'film', 'great', 'extent', 'understatement', 'very', 'British', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'States.The', 'deliberately', 'diverted', 'visit', 'MP', 'consorts', 'moored', 'slave', 'ship', 'was', 'metaphor', 'power', 'misery', 'was', 'conveyed', 'being', 'completely', 'thrust', 'face', 'final', 'tribute', 'Wilberforce', 'was', 'notable', 'example', 'power', 'use', 'few', 'chosen', 'words', 'rather', 'many.The', 'film', 'was', 'moving', 'inspirational', 'era', 'quick', 'fix', 'reminded', 'do', 'lives', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'Desmond', 'Tutu', 'importance', 'never', 'giving', 'up', 'fight', 'more', 'just', 'humane', 'world', 'Evil', 'prospers', 'when', 'good', 'men', 'women', 'do', 'nothing', '-but', 'need', 'do', 'again', 'again', 'again', 'are', 'more', 'slaves', 'world', 'today', 'were', 'time', 'abolition', 'trust', 'film', 'will', 'inspire', 'generation', 'continue', 'struggle.For', 'who', 'want', 'more', 'politically', 'correct', 'revisionist', 'view', 'history', 'who', 'cry', 'paternalism', 'be', 'emphasised', 'Wilberforce', 'supporters', 'took', 'might', 'political', 'economic', 'establishment', 'day', 'won', 'was', 'compassionate', 'man', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'champion', 'justice', 'justice', 'see', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'help', 'equals.This', 'outstanding', 'piece', 'film', 'making', 'justice', 'achievement', 'Wilberforce', 'associates']",Amazing Grace [Theatrical Release]
655058,A2BIAR1V0PWO27,B00005JPOE,"Roger Kennedy ""International Military Music S...","[3, 3]","This is a fine film with a good cast.  Anything with Ioin Gruffudd is usually good.  He was great in the Hornblower series.  This film deals with the issue of abolition, and how it started in England long before it was ever known in the States.  Fortunately this film does not become too preachy on a topic which is normally quite moralistic in tone.  The perspective here is more on the inner-workings of politics and how Wilberforce had to work the English parliamentry system to achieve his goal.  One must give the English system credit for passing such a measure without bloodshed, something which required a bloody Civil War in this country some 60 years later!The main interest for me in this film however is the massed band sequence at the end just before the credits.  The sight and sound of the bands is quite fascinating, even if not historically accurate. The tune ""Amazing Grace"" has long been associated with the Scottish pipes, although it is doubtful that it was played in the fashion shown here.  For one, pipers in the Scottish regiments were generally not known to play together until sometime later in the 19th century where they eventually combined with the drums to produce the sight and sound we know so well today.The military bands shown also would not likely have combined to play in this manner at that time.  The modern assocation we have today with the bands and pipes combination must come from the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards who made their version of ""Amazing Grace"" so famous in 1972.  The legend of that recording which those two bands of the regiment produced lives on today and even gets picked up in movies like this!  Still, the sight and sound of these bands in period unifroms, and with period instrumentation is fascinating for the true student of military music like myself.British military bands of the period rarely combined in larger ensembles than their own band, and on the rare occasions they did the results were often not promising.  We are reminded of the famous incident from the Crimean War where all the regimental bands tried playing ""God Save The Queen"" and did so in different keys and arrangements!  The resulting noise drove the Duke of Cambridge to create the Royal Military School of Music at Kneller Hall in 1857.  This venerable institution is now celebrating its 150th anniversary where it continues to turn out polished musicians for the remainig few British military bands of today.  Those wanting to catch a glimpse of the original ""Amazing Grace"" as made famous in 1972 should catch the 2008 USA Tour of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards and the Band of the Coldstream Guards.",4,The True Amazing Grace,1198022400,"12 19, 2007",2007,2640,"['fine', 'film', 'good', 'cast', 'Anything', 'Ioin', 'Gruffudd', 'usually', 'good', 'was', 'great', 'Hornblower', 'series', 'film', 'issue', 'abolition', 'how', 'started', 'England', 'long', 'was', 'ever', 'known', 'States', 'Fortunately', 'film', 'not', 'become', 'too', 'preachy', 'topic', 'normally', 'quite', 'moralistic', 'tone', 'perspective', 'here', 'more', 'inner-workings', 'politics', 'how', 'Wilberforce', 'had', 'work', 'English', 'parliamentry', 'system', 'achieve', 'goal', 'One', 'must', 'give', 'English', 'system', 'credit', 'passing', 'measure', 'bloodshed', 'something', 'required', 'bloody', 'Civil', 'War', 'country', '60', 'years', 'later', 'main', 'interest', 'film', 'however', 'massed', 'band', 'sequence', 'end', 'just', 'credits', 'sight', 'sound', 'bands', 'quite', 'fascinating', 'even', 'not', 'historically', 'accurate', 'tune', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'long', 'been', 'associated', 'Scottish', 'pipes', 'doubtful', 'was', 'played', 'fashion', 'shown', 'here', 'one', 'pipers', 'Scottish', 'regiments', 'were', 'generally', 'not', 'known', 'play', 'together', 'sometime', 'later', '19th', 'century', 'where', 'eventually', 'combined', 'drums', 'produce', 'sight', 'sound', 'know', 'so', 'well', 'today.The', 'military', 'bands', 'shown', 'also', 'would', 'not', 'likely', 'have', 'combined', 'play', 'manner', 'time', 'modern', 'assocation', 'have', 'today', 'bands', 'pipes', 'combination', 'must', 'come', 'Royal', 'Scots', 'Dragoon', 'Guards', 'who', 'made', 'version', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'so', 'famous', '1972', 'legend', 'recording', 'two', 'bands', 'regiment', 'produced', 'lives', 'today', 'even', 'picked', 'up', 'movies', 'Still', 'sight', 'sound', 'bands', 'period', 'unifroms', 'period', 'instrumentation', 'fascinating', 'true', 'student', 'military', 'music', 'myself.British', 'military', 'bands', 'period', 'rarely', 'combined', 'larger', 'ensembles', 'own', 'band', 'rare', 'occasions', 'did', 'results', 'were', 'often', 'not', 'promising', 'are', 'reminded', 'famous', 'incident', 'Crimean', 'War', 'where', 'regimental', 'bands', 'tried', 'playing', 'God', 'Save', 'Queen', 'did', 'so', 'different', 'keys', 'arrangements', 'resulting', 'noise', 'drove', 'Duke', 'Cambridge', 'create', 'Royal', 'Military', 'School', 'Music', 'Kneller', 'Hall', '1857', 'venerable', 'institution', 'now', 'celebrating', '150th', 'anniversary', 'where', 'turn', 'out', 'polished', 'musicians', 'remainig', 'few', 'British', 'military', 'bands', 'today', 'wanting', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'original', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'made', 'famous', '1972', 'should', 'catch', '2008', 'USA', 'Tour', 'Royal', 'Scots', 'Dragoon', 'Guards', 'Band', 'Coldstream', 'Guards']",Amazing Grace [Theatrical Release]

The unlikely songwriter was reformed and repentant Christian ex-slave trader, John Newton, who, like Wilberforce, was a prime example of the liberal abolitionist Christians of the 18th and 19th centuries.  These great men provide a stark contrast between the conservative pseudo-Christians of today, who march in near total lockstep with the conservative business and political agenda, with the real Christian progressives (i.e., liberals) of yesteryear and today.  As accurately portrayed in the movie, the Christian liberal abolitionists squared-off in a David vs. Goliath mismatch against the united conservative business and political juggernaut of their time, in this case united behind the fortunes being made in the slave trade.  Instead of a civil war ending slavery, the British experienced the ending of this abomination due almost 100% to the determined efforts of the Christian abolitionists portrayed in the movie.The movie does a great job of capturing and portraying the dogged determination, principled perseverance, and ultimate victory of as unlikely a group of successful and inspirational protagonists as could be imagined.

Standing for justice in an unjust world is swimming against the tide of current cultural norms at times but the end is sure as long as one stands.  As with so many, there were unfortunate liberties taken with historical fact with this film but the overall affect was true, at least in spirit.  Mr. Wilberforce's faith rings authentic in the film and the results on his life and political views were unmistakable.  The message is loud and clear, good does indeed triumph - at times it seems slow in coming but the end is inevitable when we are firm.The cultural norms of the Mr. Wilberforce's day seem foreign and unthinkable to us today.  One wonders what norms of today will be obvious moral and civil rights issues tomorrow.  Will history record that we were on the right side of those issues or will it find us with a majority that resists what is right?  Each must examine their own conscience.  May we, like Wilberforce, find the courage to be on the side of political right rather than political expediency.

It is highly accurate historically (with a few very minor exceptions - for example, I'm told that they were a little off in how long John Newton was a slave trader), has a very engaging and inspiring true-life story about a great Christian statesman, and was very well done artistically. This isn't your low-budget B movie that many associate with the Christian film genre; unlike films like ""Left Behind,"" the production values of this film are great (in fact, it was produced by one of the major Hollywood studios and has production values comparable to other major Hollywood films). To make a long story short, it has everything you could want from a truly great, possibly even classic, movie. The acting was great, the sets were great, the writing was great, the cinematography was great, and the editing and all the other technical aspects were right on target too.My only minor complaint was I'm not sure I agree with how they portrayed John Newton. They portray him as being plagued by guilt about his past. I'm not sure if that was a historical reality that they had to portray or a decision they made about how to portray it.With that said, I thought this was a wonderful movie.

655080,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B00005JPOE,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[4, 4]","Ioan Gruffudd gives an invigorating performance as William Wilberforce, the sharp-witted, determined supporter of abolition in Amazing Grace, the true story of one man's struggle against a kingdom. With impressive performances from an equally impressive cast, this epic battle is one fought not with blood and steel, but of intelligent words and cunning linguistics. Brimming with intricate character development, pertinent morals, and thematic gusto, Amazing Grace is a period piece not confined by its period or the piece of history it so masterfully depicts.In 18th century England, William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) fought tirelessly in Parliament to end slavery and the slave trade throughout the British Empire. Amazing Grace chronicles his successes and defeats and also delves deeper into the life of the remarkable idealist and the events that shaped and influenced his extraordinary career. Forced to contend with debilitating illness as well as the ruthlessly powerful and deviously manipulative lords supporting the slave trade, Wilberforce overcame adverse odds and managed to construct a diverse and unexpectedly strong movement for abolition. Comprised of a flashback structure that relates his many tribulations, Amazing Grace also reveals a poignant tale of love, friendship, and the unending efforts that led to his monumental achievements.Based on the true story of William Wilberforce and his endeavors in Parliament to abolish slavery, Amazing Grace utilizes flashbacks to connect the arcing storyline that traverses several years nonsequentially. At once both an engaging courtroom drama and a whimsical love story, the carefully structured film remains assertively paced throughout and the mood is seldom as grim as its subject matter would expectedly afford. Combined with compelling characters and subsequently affecting character development, Amazing Grace boasts a surprisingly epic feel for a film devoid of any gladiators or soldiers dying on the battlefield.Though its themes are powerfully presented, Amazing Grace would not have achieved its pronounced conviction were it not for the overwhelming talent of its cast. Ioan Gruffudd magnificently portrays the brazen speaker with rebellious charm and heartfelt sincerity from his stunning accomplishments to his tragic defeats. Aiding him in his ceaseless crusade are Pitt (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Clarkson (Rufus Sewell) who both give strong performances; Pitt as a figurehead working behind the scenes and Clarkson as his resolute right-hand man. Michael Gambon effortlessly scene steals as the cynically droll Lord Fox, ever ready with his sharp tongue and comedically commanding presence. Albert Finney also turns in a bold portrayal of John Newton, the former slave ship captain who wrote the title song and sought forgiveness for his sins. The antagonistic Lord Tarleton (Ciaran Hinds) and Duke of Clarence (Toby Jones) add a refined touch of villainy to their characters, creating a far more satisfying conclusion when they finally fall to the band of ingenious heroes. Not a dull performance exists in this graceful drama, and even the rather expected love interest is handled refreshingly by the lovely Romola Garai.Perhaps a bit over sentimental at times, Amazing Grace still captivates with its diverse cast of exceptional talent, often movingly witty dialogue, magnificent recreations of 18th century costumes and sets, and the incredible true story of one man's unceasing quest for justice. Thankfully relinquishing any long-winded speeches, Amazing Grace allows the actions of the dauntless Wilberforce and his followers to do what they do best - speak for themselves.- Joel Massie",4,Amazing Grace Movie Review,1195084800,"11 15, 2007",2007,3679,"['Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'invigorating', 'performance', 'William', 'Wilberforce', 'sharp-witted', 'determined', 'supporter', 'abolition', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'true', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'struggle', 'kingdom', 'impressive', 'performances', 'equally', 'impressive', 'cast', 'epic', 'battle', 'one', 'fought', 'not', 'blood', 'steel', 'intelligent', 'words', 'cunning', 'linguistics', 'Brimming', 'intricate', 'character', 'development', 'pertinent', 'morals', 'thematic', 'gusto', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'period', 'not', 'confined', 'period', 'piece', 'history', 'so', 'masterfully', 'depicts.In', '18th', 'century', 'England', 'William', 'Wilberforce', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'fought', 'tirelessly', 'Parliament', 'end', 'slavery', 'slave', 'trade', 'British', 'Empire', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'successes', 'defeats', 'also', 'deeper', 'life', 'remarkable', 'idealist', 'events', 'shaped', 'influenced', 'extraordinary', 'career', 'Forced', 'contend', 'debilitating', 'illness', 'as', 'well', 'ruthlessly', 'powerful', 'deviously', 'manipulative', 'lords', 'supporting', 'slave', 'trade', 'Wilberforce', 'overcame', 'adverse', 'odds', 'managed', 'construct', 'diverse', 'unexpectedly', 'strong', 'movement', 'abolition', 'Comprised', 'flashback', 'structure', 'many', 'tribulations', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'also', 'poignant', 'tale', 'love', 'friendship', 'unending', 'efforts', 'led', 'monumental', 'achievements.Based', 'true', 'story', 'William', 'Wilberforce', 'endeavors', 'Parliament', 'abolish', 'slavery', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'flashbacks', 'connect', 'arcing', 'storyline', 'several', 'years', 'nonsequentially', 'once', 'engaging', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'whimsical', 'love', 'story', 'carefully', 'structured', 'film', 'assertively', 'paced', 'mood', 'seldom', 'as', 'grim', 'subject', 'matter', 'would', 'expectedly', 'afford', 'Combined', 'compelling', 'characters', 'subsequently', 'affecting', 'character', 'development', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'surprisingly', 'epic', 'feel', 'film', 'devoid', 'gladiators', 'soldiers', 'dying', 'battlefield.Though', 'themes', 'are', 'powerfully', 'presented', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'achieved', 'pronounced', 'conviction', 'were', 'not', 'overwhelming', 'talent', 'cast', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'magnificently', 'brazen', 'speaker', 'rebellious', 'charm', 'heartfelt', 'sincerity', 'stunning', 'accomplishments', 'tragic', 'defeats', 'Aiding', 'ceaseless', 'crusade', 'are', 'Pitt', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'Clarkson', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'who', 'give', 'strong', 'performances', 'Pitt', 'figurehead', 'working', 'scenes', 'Clarkson', 'resolute', 'right-hand', 'man', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'effortlessly', 'steals', 'cynically', 'droll', 'Lord', 'Fox', 'ever', 'ready', 'sharp', 'tongue', 'comedically', 'commanding', 'presence', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'also', 'bold', 'portrayal', 'John', 'Newton', 'former', 'slave', 'ship', 'captain', 'who', 'wrote', 'title', 'song', 'sought', 'forgiveness', 'sins', 'antagonistic', 'Lord', 'Tarleton', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'Duke', 'Clarence', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'add', 'refined', 'touch', 'villainy', 'characters', 'creating', 'far', 'more', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'when', 'finally', 'fall', 'band', 'ingenious', 'heroes', 'Not', 'dull', 'performance', 'graceful', 'drama', 'even', 'rather', 'expected', 'love', 'interest', 'handled', 'refreshingly', 'lovely', 'Romola', 'Garai.Perhaps', 'bit', 'sentimental', 'times', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'still', 'diverse', 'cast', 'exceptional', 'talent', 'often', 'movingly', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'magnificent', 'recreations', '18th', 'century', 'costumes', 'sets', 'incredible', 'true', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'unceasing', 'quest', 'justice', 'Thankfully', 'relinquishing', 'long-winded', 'speeches', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'actions', 'dauntless', 'Wilberforce', 'followers', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'best', 'speak', 'themselves.-', 'Joel', 'Massie']",Amazing Grace [Theatrical Release]

655083,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00005JPOE,Turfseer,"[1, 1]","Amazing Grace is the story of William Wilberforce, a Member of Parliament chiefly responsible for the abolition of slavery in the British Empire in the latter part of the 18th century and beginning of the 19th. Focusing on the political struggle as opposed to the individual stories of slaves themselves, the film's creators have crafted a moving and highly entertaining story of a now mostly forgotten period in world history.We begin with an introduction to the 'ordinary world' of Wilberforce. Right away he's depicted as someone who is compassionate toward animals after he alights from his coach and prevents two men from beating a horse (it's one of Blake Snyder's 'Save the Cat' moments: according to screen writing guru Snyder, a good screenplay always has a moment early on where the protagonist does a good deed, creating audience sympathy). After Wilberforce arrives at his cousin's estate, he dreams of smashing glasses during a banquet held by high society people, foreshadowing his struggle with pro-slavery forces throughout the movie. We're also introduced to Barbara Spooner, the woman he eventually marries. No sparks fly between them during their first meeting and Wilberforce appears disinterested with the prospect of hooking up with her. Wilberforce is depicted as a complex character from the outset. But his moral compass is always firm (as he looks in the mirror, images of slaves in chains appear--these flashbacks to the actual scenes of slavery are never overdone).Before we break into Act 2 of the story, there's always some kind of 'inciting incident' or catalyst which gets the action moving. In Amazing Grace, the flashback to 15 years earlier, marking Wilberforce's early career as a politician, is the actual inciting incident. We see the extremely articulate and witty Wilberforce as a young man in Parliament, debating with conservatives over the course of the war with America. There's a great scene where the Duke of Clarence (brilliantly played by Toby Jones) shocks our modern day sensibilities with his request to ""fetch my n-gger""--his black servant is brought in and offered by the Duke as a wager during a card game with Wilberforce. While Wilberforce does walk out in disgust, he doesn't hold a grudge against his fellow MP's (Members of Parliament). He realizes he needs to work with these people and movingly sings 'Amazing Grace' to show them just where his sentiments lie. Wilberforce's internal conflict is dramatized as he communes with nature on his country estate. He's conflicted about whether he should pursue a solitary spiritual life as opposed to continuing his career in politics. His servant who quotes Francis Bacon, points out that serving God and pursuing political ends in the cause of justice are not incompatible. Wilberforce's eccentric personality is also depicted: his mansion is overflowing with animals and beggars who he can't say no to--bent on obtaining a free lunch.We break into Act 2 when the a group of abolitionists visit Wilberforce. The key moment is when Henry Clarkson, one of the more radical abolitionists, displays the actual chains at the dinner table used by slave traders and when former slave Olaudah Equiano opens his shirt to reveal how he was branded during the time of his captivity. The first half of Act 2 of Amazing Grace involves the initial successes of the abolitionists. We skip forward to the 'present time' and a series of events unfold including Wilberforce's developing relationship with Barbara Spooner, introduction of the principal antagonist, Lord Tarleton, the defection of Charles Fox, the pro-slavery MP who joins the small group of anti-slavery MPs, and Wilberforce dramatically forcing upper crust Londoners (partying on a boat) to take in the ""smell of death' from a slave ship docked in the Harbor. The midpoint of the story is usually a 'false victory' for the protagonist and his allies. In Amazing Grace, the abolitionists' publicity campaign is working. Fifty thousand copies of Equiano's book have been sold in two months and Wilberforce remarks (in a voice-over), ""our message was everywhere.""The second half of Act 2 usually leads to a temporary defeat for the protagonist. Despite collecting 390,000 signatures on a petition and presenting it to Parliament, the war with France has turned public opinion against the abolitionists. Slavery is seen as necessary to the economy and the public now believes its abolition will undermine the war effort. Prime Minister Pitt can no longer support Wilberforce given the changed political realities. The end of Act 2 usually features a 'dark moment of the soul' for the protagonist. Members of the public walk out on an anti-slavery deacon's sermon and Wilberforce has another attack of his 'colitis', symbolizing the effect of the pro-slavery forces' counterattack.At the beginning of Act 3, the protagonist must regroup and once again attempt to battle his opponents. Wilberforce's wedding to Barbara Spooner serves as a brief respite before he goes into battle once again. This time, the abolitionists are aided by James Stevens, a lawyer who devises a plan to seize French ships sailing under neutral American flags. Since 80% of slave ships are under the American flag, removing the protection of the neutral flags, will effectively end the slave trade. The climax occurs when Wilberforce and his allies give free racetrack tickets to MPs who aren't there for the crucial vote regarding the French ships.Wilberforce now returns to his 'ordinary world' which has been transformed. His life has been renewed--he's now able to cope with his crippling colitis and his wife has given him six children. Finally, he lives to see an 283 to 16 vote in Parliament abolishing slavery throughout the British empire. Amazing Grace is not only a great history lesson. The casting and performances are superb and the story is inspirational. This is a film that should be viewed multiple times.",5,Exceptional history lesson and inspirational drama,1236988800,"03 14, 2009",2009,5948,"['Amazing', 'Grace', 'story', 'William', 'Wilberforce',

It's the kind of historical knowledge that more people should become familiar with.I was impressed with WW's commitment to social justice, more compassion for animals, and improvements in health care and education.  Ioan Gruffudd does a nice job in the role of WW, as does Albert Finney, who plays his mentor, John Newton.  Ciaran Hinds and Toby Jones are at the top of their game as the main opposition in the House of Commons.It would have been more effective to have more slaves featured so we could hear their point of view; as it is, only one former slave gets to say anything about his horrific experiences.Overall, however, this is a story worth getting to know.",4,A story more people should become familiar with,1196121600,"11 27, 2007",2007,829,"['must', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'William', 'Wilberforce', 'was', 'saw', 'film', 'did', 'know', 'composer', 'John', 'Newton', 'had', 'once', 'been', 'slave', 'trader', 'kind', 'historical', 'knowledge', 'more', 'people', 'should', 'become', 'familiar', 'with.I', 'was', 'impressed', 'WW', 'commitment', 'social', 'justice', 'more', 'compassion', 'animals', 'improvements', 'health', 'care', 'education', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'nice', 'job', 'role', 'WW', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'who', 'mentor', 'John', 'Newton', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'are', 'top', 'game', 'main', 'opposition', 'House', 'Commons.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'effective', 'have', 'more', 'slaves', 'featured', 'could', 'hear', 'point', 'view', 'only', 'one', 'former', 'slave', 'say', 'anything', 'horrific', 'experiences.Overall', 'however', 'story', 'worth', 'getting', 'know']",Amazing Grace [Theatrical Release]
