1424157,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B004QIG7CW,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[3, 4]","In 2007, Mark Peter Hughes wrote a fictional novel titled ""Lemonade Mouth"" about five teenagers who meet in detention and form a band despite the personal problems that these kids are experiencing in their personal lives.Sure enough, a loosely-based film adaptation in 2011 was written by April Blair (""Monte Carlo"", ""Christmas Caper"") and directed by Patricia Riggen (""Under the Same Moon"") and premiered on the Disney Channel on April 15, 2011.The film was watched by 5.7 million viewers and the soundtrack for the film debuted at #18 on the Billboard 200 chart and the following week, jumping up to #4.""Lemonade Mouth"" is a film that revolves around five teenagers, each with their own personal quirks and have their own issues that they are trying to overcome.  One day, each of them got into trouble and had to serve a day in detention.  While together in detention, Miss Reznick (played by Tisha Campbell-Martin, ""Martin"", ""My Wife and Kids"", ""Rita Rocks""), she has the kids cleaning the basement in order to make it a music room.While she gives principal Brenigan (played by Christopher McDonald, ""Thelma & Louise"", ""Happy Gilmore"", ""Requiem for a Dream"") a piece of her mind, for moving extracurricular activities (such as clubs, music and art) tot he basement of the school in order to make room for a gymnasium.While the kids are cleaning up the music room, sure enough, the five start playing their instruments and perform with each other.  Each do a magnificent job that Mizz Reznick wants them to continue their music and form a band.These five individuals at first are reluctant but because they all have their own personal issues, they all become good friends and form the band known as Lemonade Mouth.But while they try to make Lemonade Mouth a success, the popular band in school, Mudslide Crush want to make sure there is no room for another band on campus.  How will the members of Lemonade Mouth respond?""Lemonade Mouth: Extended Edition"" will be released on DVD and will come with a DVD and digital copy version of the film.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Lemonade Mouth"" is presented in widescreen (1:78:1 - enhanced for 169 televisions).  The picture quality of the DVD is very good.  As expected with DVD, you can see some artifacting but for the most part, picture quality is good.As for audio, ""Lemonade Mouth: Extended Edition"" is presented in English and Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1.  The soundtrack features a front and center-channel driven soundtrack with crowd ambiance being utilized through the surround channels.  While the dialogue is clear, the highlight of ""Lemonade Mouth"" is the film's music.As one would expect from a Disney Channel film driven by its musical soundtrack, you can definitely expect catchy pop tunes, especially the song ""Determinate"" which is a pretty solid song and I don't know of which members really did sing for the soundtrack but if it was the actual cast, especially the female members of the group, they did a pretty solid job.  Also, for the guys of Mudslide Crush.Once again, another Disney Channel film with a pretty solid musical soundtrack!SPECIAL FEATURES:""Lemonade Mouth: Extended Edition"" comes with the following special features:Rock-Along - Rock with the band to all your favorite songs while watching the film.  During the music scenes, karaoke style subtitles are displayed on screen.Exclusive Scene - (5:31) The band members of Lemonade Mouth is interviewed for a television show.EXTRAS:""Lemonade Mouth: Extended Edition"" comes with a slipover cover case and a digital copy of the feature film which works with iTunes and Windows Media Player.JUDGMENT CALL:""Lemonade Mouth"" is another exciting and catchy Disney Channel film that showcases teenagers and music.While the novel focused on a story told by a freshman and some storylines being changed for the film adaptation, for the majority of the story, ""Lemonade Mouth"" still manages to contain the positive vibe of the film.  What one can expect is a group of friends taking on their own personal problems.  At first, these individuals had issues but when they get to know each other, they realized that they all have issues and together they manage to grow, become friends and each of them are able to take on their own personal challenges.And these are stories that can easily relate to teens.  With Stella, being an activist and trying to fit in; Mo, is a girl who has a strict father and because of culture, she is unable to do the things that she wants to do; Charlie is a guy who constantly gets compared to his athletic brother and is expected to perform at that same level, even if he's not athletic; Olivia, being the shy girl who doesn't have her parents around and struggles with that, while Wen does have a family but can't stand his father dating a young woman.  These are problems that teenagers face and the film does take on themes of honesty, empowerment and expressionism but most of all, each of them overcoming adversity.Sure, it's a musically-driven film like many Disney Channel teen films that came out but in this case, it was fun to have this ""Breakfast Club"" type of storyline  but to see these teens form a band and have fun together.  The musical soundtrack is very good and if there is one thing that I wished was included on the ""Extended Edition"", was the fact that it should have come out with a soundtrack like last year's Disney Channel film ""StarStruck"".  But you do get a digital copy of the film which you can watch on your laptop, iPhone, iPod or iPad via iTunes or Windows Media Player.I do feel that ""Lemonade Mouth"", similar to ""High School Musical"" has the potential to grow and have its own sequel.  It's a fun series and because there are a good amount of characters to focus on, it would be cool to see the group move on to the next level and performing for larger audiences (as hinted on the ""extended music scene"" that was featured at the end of the credits and on the special features) and tackling a whole new set of fears and challenges.  And also, there are potential romantic situations that can easily be focused on in this film.Overall, ""Lemonade Mouth: Extended Edition"" is another solid Disney Channel music-driven teen film.  The story was good, characters were fun and I enjoyed the musical soundtrack.If you loved the film  or you missed it on the Disney Channel, definitely give it a chance!",4,"""Lemonade Mouth"" is a fun and enjoyable teen film with good music and a positive message.",1306195200,"05 24, 2011",2011,6363,"['2007', 'Mark', 'Peter', 'Hughes', 'wrote', 'fictional', 'novel', 'titled', 'Lemonade', 'Mouth',

1424158,A3MNJL4ROH6LRW,B004QIG7CW,Don R. Holloway,"[0, 0]","This is a movie about a group of high school students who meet in detention after school. They discover they have two things in common: they all see themselves as outcasts and they all have a love of music. After some discussion, they decide to form a band. It's interesting how they come up with the name Lemonade Mouth for their band's name. Watch the movie and find out.I want to point out that while I do enjoy seeing a Disney movie now and then, that is not what attracted me to this movie. The thing that did attract me to this movie was the fact that it was directed by Patricia Riggen. Her name alone was enough to make me watch the movie. And Riggen didn't disappoint me. There is a certain central theme or thread that runs through Riggen's movies. And that is that she likes to take a group of people who are looked down upon by others and she gives them a face and a voice and she makes them human. Then she makes us care about these people. She did this to perfection in her film ""Under the Same Moon"" which is one of my all time favorite films.If you watch Lemonade Mouth, be aware that the movie does start out a little slow. But don't let that deter you from watching. The movie gets better and better as it progresses. I loved the diverse background of each of the students and how they stood up for each other and for their own beliefs. I'm not really big on musicals, that's the main reason I gave this movie 4 stars instead on 5, but this one is a winner. If you haven't seen it on TV, get the DVD and watch it.

1424161,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,B004QIG7CW,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[2, 2]","It might be easy for the jaded among us to dismiss Lemonade Mouth as a TV movie attempt to launch another Hannah Montana franchise, this time with a full group, or to make the High School Musical lightning strike again. That may all be true to a degree; surely Disney Channel would welcome a new vein of gold, especially since so many of their series (Hannah, Jonas, Zack and Cody, Wizards of Waverly) are now in the rearview mirror.But Lemonade Mouth is actually a solid little teen drama with music. The songs are more or less incidental to the story. Each of the leads has his or her own cross to bear and the film is about their journey through acceptance of their situations, not simply easy, Brady Bunch style solutions. They that also launch a successful rock band is perhaps preposterous, but their cohesion as a group is really the focus, not the showbiz glitz. It's not the dazzling Barbie-playset fantasy of Hannah or the recent Sharpay film.And these young people are actually given roles to play, some rather complex. It is a credit to the actors and the director that they don't take the easy route of teenage overacting so common in teen dramas that it almost becomes self-parody (and was actually skewered on Sonny With a Chance, another Disney Channel series that has ended, albeit retooled as a sketch series called So Random).I like this film much more than I expected to and so did my wife. My 13-year-old daughter adored it and watched it multiple times. But parents be warned -- this is not your usual pratfall-but-good-natured goofball Disney Channel fare. One girl is asserting her question of authority, a very natural course for the age group but still uncommon in this venue. But though these kids have fairly dark and realistic problems, it's all done with taste and restraint.Ably heading the cast is Bridgit Mendler, skillfully carrying off a much deeper characterization than she is allowed to do on the broad sitcom, Good Luck Charlie. She reminds me of a young Audrey Meadows, or perhaps Victoria Tennant.Christopher McDonald really should apply for a patent for the role he once again plays -- an insufferable, narcissistic glory seeking bureaucrat -- this time as a principal on wheels. His performance is a nice example of comic timing and lightens the mood as well as providing a foil.And Mel's Lemonade looks like something I would want to buy if I could find it in a vending machine.",5,Lemonade Mouth shoots from the hip,1307318400,"06 6, 2011",2011,2422,"['might', 'be', 'easy', 'jaded', 'dismiss', 'Lemonade', 'Mouth', 'TV', 'movie', 'attempt', 'launch', 'Hannah', 'Montana', 'franchise', 'time', 'full', 'group', 'make', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'lightning', 'strike', 'again', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'degree', 'surely', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'would', 'welcome', 'new', 'vein', 'gold', 'especially', 'so', 'many', 'series', 'Hannah', 'Jonas', 'Zack', 'Cody', 'Wizards', 'Waverly', 'are', 'now', 'rearview', 'mirror.But', 'Lemonade', 'Mouth', 'actually', 'solid', 'little', 'teen', 'drama', 'music', 'songs', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'incidental', 'story', 'leads', 'own', 'cross', 'bear', 'film', 'journey', 'acceptance', 'situations', 'not', 'simply', 'easy', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'style', 'solutions', 'also', 'successful', 'rock', 'band', 'perhaps', 'preposterous', 'cohesion', 'group', 'really', 'focus', 'not', 'showbiz', 'glitz', 'not', 'dazzling', 'Barbie-playset', 'fantasy', 'Hannah', 'recent', 'Sharpay', 'film.And', 'young', 'people', 'are', 'actually', 'given', 'roles', 'play', 'rather', 'complex', 'credit', 'actors', 'director', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'easy', 'route', 'teenage', 'overacting', 'so', 'common', 'teen', 'dramas', 'almost', 'self-parody', 'was', 'actually', 'skewered', 'Sonny', 'Chance', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'series', 'ended', 'albeit', 'retooled', 'sketch', 'series', 'called', 'So', 'Random', '.I', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'expected', 'so', 'did', 'wife', '13-year-old', 'daughter', 'adored', 'watched', 'multiple', 'times', 'parents', 'be', 'warned', 'not', 'usual', 'pratfall-but-good-natured', 'goofball', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'fare', 'One', 'girl', 'asserting', 'question', 'authority', 'very', 'natural', 'course', 'age', 'group', 'still', 'uncommon', 'venue', 'kids', 'have', 'fairly', 'dark', 'realistic', 'problems', 'done', 'taste', 'restraint.Ably', 'heading', 'cast', 'Bridgit', 'Mendler', 'skillfully', 'carrying', 'off', 'much', 'deeper', 'characterization', 'allowed', 'do', 'broad', 'sitcom', 'Good', 'Luck', 'Charlie', 'young', 'Audrey', 'Meadows', 'perhaps', 'Victoria', 'Tennant.Christopher', 'McDonald', 'really', 'should', 'apply', 'patent', 'role', 'once', 'again', 'plays', 'insufferable', 'narcissistic', 'glory', 'seeking', 'bureaucrat', 'time', 'principal', 'wheels', 'performance', 'nice', 'example', 'comic', 'timing', 'mood', 'as', 'well', 'providing', 'foil.And', 'Mel', 'Lemonade', 'something', 'would', 'want', 'buy', 'could', 'find', 'vending', 'machine']",Lemonade Mouth

1424167,A18HHKM6WGEF9D,B004QIG7CW,"L. Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[0, 0]","This is one of the most recent Disney musical movies, ala High School Musical and Camp Rock. This one centers on 5 high schoolers - 2 girls and 3 boys - that meet up in detention (all for minor infractions or misunderstandings), and end up forming a band. The way the band forms, and their instant musical chemistry, completely defies reality, but that's musicals for you. They end up competing against an existing popular high school band, and have to fight through the usual doubts and ostracization, as well as each having parental difficulties to overcome. As is typical in these movies, most of the adults are either cruel or clueless or both, which always bothers me a bit, but of course this is how tweens and teens often view adults, so that's partly a play to the target demographic. I do wish Disney would consider including some truly kind, engaged, insightful adults, so there was some model of kids turning to adults for help with their problems, but that may be too much to ask (it's one of the reasons I gave this 4 rather than 5 stars however.)The music is more rock than others, and there is a 'question authority/stand up for what's right' theme that some parents might object too, although I personally felt it was handled fine.

I love the friendship, be strong, be proud, stand up for what you believe in theme.The movie starts out with Stella, a new girl who is angry about moving and starting a new school a month into the semester.  She finds herself in detention where she meets four other freshman students. They seem to have nothing in common until, they start putting together a beat, each one bringing something different to the sound. Before you know it, they are a band.With the help of a Lemonade Machine, a spirited music teacher played by Trisha Campbell Martin, and Stella with a penchant for being heard, the group play in front of their peers and are actually really good.I loved the building of the friendships between the kids and how their problems seemed very real and not contrived. There is someone everyone can relate to; whether you are the ignored kid, the quiet kid, the overachiever, you will find someone who resonates with you.Another surprised was that the songs were actually good!
