1456112,A3EHIGO4FNILXP,B005DU58QS,.fgd,"[13, 14]",Monica de Carmen kept my attention despite many scenes without a lot of action. There is a sense of a woman who maintains and sustains her self like her own horse in a stable. Even though much footage of Carmen going about the course of her domestic activities it is satisfying to watch her somehow. She ticks off all the boxes but there is a  blind spot in her sexual personal emotional life although she is not lonley in family life. It could also be not blind but a known tragic cause that she is too stoic to admit to.  We never find out. In a jaded yet methodical way she makes herself look nice ...smile and try to find a new man to fill in the gap inside her. Patience pays off. One night she meets a sado-masochist who prompts her to think and feel out side the box I became saddened and impatient half way through it seemed as though after one liberating orgasm she quickly traded sexual satisfaction for token affectionin a pathetic way.. Pain escalates and intensifies her inner landscape.In a blind clumsey and quirky way it finely tuned her real needs wherein they were resolved in a surprising way that made this a satisfying film to have watched.I had to re-watch the end because I missed the clincher which is a quiet enigmatic sentence to her brother which I wont print as its a spoiler. But in a surprisingly calm way the box was finally ticked on that which was missing inside her life. A surprising optamistic film then. Loneliness or kinkyness can metamorphose into an unhealthy even dangerous state if left to stew overtime. Strangely pain can also take the bull by the horns.,5,suprisingly good,1334620800,"04 17, 2012",2012,1598,"['Monica', 'de', 'Carmen', 'kept', 'attention', 'many', 'scenes', 'lot', 'action', 'sense', 'woman', 'who', 'self', 'own', 'horse', 'stable', 'Even', 'much', 'footage', 'Carmen', 'going', 'course', 'domestic', 'activities', 'satisfying', 'watch', 'somehow', 'boxes', 'blind', 'spot', 'sexual', 'personal', 'emotional', 'life', 'not', 'lonley', 'family', 'life', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'not', 'blind', 'known', 'tragic', 'cause', 'too', 'stoic', 'admit', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'jaded', 'yet', 'methodical', 'way', 'look', 'nice', 'smile', 'try', 'find', 'new', 'man', 'fill', 'gap', 'Patience', 'off', 'One', 'night', 'sado-masochist', 'who', 'think', 'feel', 'side', 'box', 'became', 'saddened', 'impatient', 'half', 'way', 'seemed', 'one', 'liberating', 'orgasm', 'quickly', 'traded', 'sexual', 'satisfaction', 'token', 'affectionin', 'pathetic', 'way..', 'Pain', 'escalates', 'inner', 'landscape.In', 'blind', 'clumsey', 'quirky', 'way', 'finely', 'tuned', 'real', 'needs', 'wherein', 'were', 'resolved', 'surprising', 'way', 'made', 'satisfying', 'film', 'have', 'watched.I', 'had', 're-watch', 'end', 'missed', 'clincher', 'quiet', 'enigmatic', 'sentence', 'brother', 'wont', 'print', 'spoiler', 'surprisingly', 'calm', 'way', 'box', 'was', 'finally', 'ticked', 'was', 'missing', 'life', 'surprising', 'optamistic', 'film', 'then', 'Loneliness', 'kinkyness', 'can', 'metamorphose', 'unhealthy', 'even', 'dangerous', 'state', 'left', 'stew', 'overtime', 'Strangely', 'pain', 'can', 'also', 'take', 'bull', 'horns']",Leap Year

1456115,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B005DU58QS,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[13, 14]","I came across this movie and being that this year is the leap year, I decided to see it.  It is a foreign movie, made in Mexico and it may not be readily acceptable by the American audiences.  The reason I say that is because this is not a fast moving film.  Director takes his time to explain the main character, Laura.  The entire film, with exception of the very first beginning of it is filmed inside the apartment.Laura is a journalist.  Her days are spent in front of her computer.  Even her interviews with her subjects are conducted over the phone.  She talks to her editor and her family on the phone,she never sees them face to face.  In her spare time, Laura quietly observes her neighbors who live in her apartment complex.  She dares not approach them.  It becomes obvious, very early in the movie that Laura lives in the fantasy world.  If she does not have enough action, she makes it up and shares it with her mother during phone conversations and her brother who occasionally visits her in her apartment.Laura goes out and seems not to have any difficulty picking up dates. Her encounters are brief and most guys she meets are one night stands.  Until one evening, she finds a seemingly perfect date.  She finds a guy who satisfies all her fantasies and they hit it off fine.  Soon enough, it becomes obvious that Laura has obsessions with the February 29th date.  It is through her relationship with her last lover that we learn that her father died four years ago, on February 29th.  What really touched me is that for a person who is a pathological liar and who seems to numb her emotional pain with sex, Laura is sincerely grieving the death of her father.  It is heartbreaking that after four years, her longing for her father did not diminish and her grief is intensified with time.I loved the ending.  When a fatal day comes, Laura has made a decision on how she wants to end her mourning.  It is on that very day that her fate changes and she finally finds her purpose.  But to find out what happens, you must see this movie.  Be patient and with some intense search for truth inthis very emotional story about loneliness and search for purpose, one will actually like this movie very much.",3,Human condition,1329091200,"02 13, 2012",2012,2215,"['came', 'movie', 'being', 'year', 'leap', 'year', 'decided', 'see', 'foreign', 'movie', 'made', 'Mexico', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'readily', 'acceptable', 'American', 'audiences', 'reason', 'say', 'not', 'fast', 'moving', 'film', 'Director', 'time', 'explain', 'main', 'character', 'Laura', 'entire', 'film', 'exception', 'very', 'first', 'beginning', 'filmed', 'apartment.Laura', 'journalist', 'days', 'are', 'spent', 'front', 'computer', 'Even', 'interviews', 'subjects', 'are', 'conducted', 'phone', 'editor', 'family', 'phone', 'never', 'face', 'face', 'spare', 'time', 'Laura', 'quietly', 'neighbors', 'who', 'live', 'apartment', 'complex', 'not', 'approach', 'obvious', 'very', 'early', 'movie', 'Laura', 'fantasy', 'world', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'action', 'up', 'shares', 'mother', 'phone', 'conversations', 'brother', 'who', 'occasionally', 'apartment.Laura', 'out', 'not', 'have', 'difficulty', 'picking', 'up', 'dates', 'encounters', 'are', 'brief', 'most', 'guys', 'meets', 'are', 'one', 'night', 'one', 'evening', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'date', 'guy', 'who', 'fantasies', 'hit', 'off', 'fine', 'Soon', 'enough', 'obvious', 'Laura', 'obsessions', 'February', '29th', 'date', 'relationship', 'last', 'lover', 'learn', 'father', 'died', 'four', 'years', 'ago', 'February', '29th', 'What', 'really', 'touched', 'person', 'who', 'pathological', 'liar', 'who', 'numb', 'emotional', 'pain', 'sex', 'Laura', 'sincerely', 'grieving', 'death', 'father', 'heartbreaking', 'four', 'years', 'longing', 'father', 'did', 'not', 'diminish', 'grief', 'intensified', 'time.I', 'loved', 'ending', 'When', 'fatal', 'day', 'Laura', 'made', 'decision', 'how', 'end', 'mourning', 'very', 'day', 'fate', 'changes', 'finally', 'purpose', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'must', 'see', 'movie', 'Be', 'patient', 'intense', 'search', 'truth', 'inthis', 'very', 'emotional', 'story', 'loneliness', 'search', 'purpose', 'one', 'will', 'actually', 'like', 'movie', 'very', 'much']",Leap Year
1456116,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B005DU58QS,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 6]","A&ntilde;o Bisiesto (Leap Year) (Michael Rowe, 2010)I am willing to admit right up front that some of my problems with this movie come from the fact that I'm really, really uncomfortable with some of the material presented here. When the Netflix description said main character Laura (Babel's Monica del Carmen) gets involved in a sadomasochistic relationship, I figured that was probably the Netflix blurbers' much-storied hyperbole kicking into action, and halfway through the movie, when we get to the kind of butt-smacking that causes women in porn films to exclaim &#8220;oh, YEAH!&#8221; in THAT voice, I figured my preconceptions were going to be borne out. But oh, how wrong I was, and like I said, I will admit up front that if you are more comfortable with such things, you might find less to criticize here than I did.But note: I said &#8220;might&#8221;, because the empirical problems with this movie are still there, and they are still mighty.Plot: Laura is a journalist leading a spectacularly unfulfilling life while keeping up appearances for the folks back home. (&#8220;I'm having dinner... I just made steak&#8221;, she says during a phone conversation to her mother, while scooping beans straight out of the can.) Her love life, in particular, is not giving her anything she needs&#8212;it's a series of one-night stands and masturbatory fantasies that leave her no better off than she was before they happened. Until, that is, spurred on by her younger brother (The Ruination of Men's Marco Zapata) finally getting involved in a stable relationship, she decides to go looking for one herself and gets involved with Arturo (Amores Perros' Gustavo S&aacute;nchez Parra), who quickly reveals himself to be a brutal, abusive, overly jealous cad of the sort that would have most people fleeing screaming in terror&#8212;but Laura seems perfectly fine with it.It's impossible to watch any sexual-obsession drama from Mexico these days and not compare it to Batalla en el Cielo, Carlos Reygadas' confusing, but accomplished, debut. In short, there is no metric by which you can compare this movie to that one in which this does not fall short. Rowe's faux-cinema-verite camerawork is laughable most of the time, used more as an excuse for crappy lighting and sound more than any artistic pretension (though not to say this movie isn't painfully pretentious). The pace is nonexistent in the first half and glacial in the second, and I say this as a huge fan of such slow-film masters as Ozu, Kieslowski, and Tarr. Simply put, there's nothing here; it's a slice-of-life drama with not enough slice for the S&M; fiends and not enough life for anyone else. Half a star because, despite my desperately wanting to, I did not shut it off, persevering to the bitter (and entirely unfulfilling) end.

1456118,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B005DU58QS,Tommy Dooley,"[20, 22]","This is a film that is hard to categorise, described by some commentators as a graphic portrayal of loneliness, it is that but a hell of a lot more. It tells the story of one month, February,  in the life of Laura; played with remarkable sincerity by Monica de Carmen. She is desperately alone; she works from home for a business magazine called -  imaginatively enough -`Your Business'. She fills the emotional void by fantasizing about people she sees, pretending that they are her friends, or by going out and picking up random hombres for sex. They all have one thing in common and that is they like doing a post coital `runner' - before the sheets have dried.Then she meets Arturo and they go at it hammer and tongs as the old saying has it. She seems to be quite imaginative in the experimental sex department and as it develops it starts getting more into the sado masochistic side and the ritual humiliation - like watersports, before going ever darker.This is a directorial debut for Australian director Michael Rowe and to call him ambitious is an under statement. To tackle such themes was always going to be challenging, yet he has done it in a caring yet honest way. There is also no background music at all; this lends itself to the realism he is aiming to create in that all of the emotion evinced from the film is through the on screen performances.This film has garnered many plaudits including one at the Cannes Film Festival but whilst it should be praised for its high `art' value, it will not be every bodies cup of tea, actually it could very well put most people off their tea with some of the scenes. This is also not pornographic as it is filmed in such a straightforward fashion, that it lacks all sense of eroticism as this is a study of someone actually losing it, but at the same time being very loving. Convincing performances all round but especially from Monica de Carmen. The language is Spanish (Mexican) with excellent sub titles and a run time of 92 minutes. So if you want a bit of truly art house, original, world cinema this will be one you will want to see.",4,"Mexican Tale of Loneliness, Lies and S & M.",1331856000,"03 16, 2012",2012,2097,"['film', 'hard', 'categorise', 'described', 'commentators', 'graphic', 'portrayal', 'loneliness', 'hell', 'lot', 'more', 'story', 'one', 'month', 'February', 'life', 'Laura', 'played', 'remarkable', 'sincerity', 'Monica', 'de', 'Carmen', 'desperately', 'alone', 'home', 'business', 'magazine', 'called', 'imaginatively', 'Business', 'emotional', 'void', 'fantasizing', 'people', 'pretending', 'are', 'friends', 'going', 'out', 'picking', 'up', 'random', 'hombres', 'sex', 'have', 'one', 'thing', 'common', 'doing', 'post', 'coital', 'runner', 'sheets', 'have', 'dried.Then', 'Arturo', 'go', 'hammer', 'tongs', 'old', 'saying', 'be', 'quite', 'imaginative', 'experimental', 'sex', 'department', 'getting', 'more', 'sado', 'masochistic', 'side', 'ritual', 'humiliation', 'watersports', 'going', 'ever', 'darker.This', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Australian', 'director', 'Michael', 'Rowe', 'call', 'ambitious', 'statement', 'tackle', 'such', 'themes', 'was', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'challenging', 'yet', 'done', 'caring', 'yet', 'honest', 'way', 'also', 'background', 'music', 'realism', 'aiming', 'create', 'emotion', 'evinced', 'film', 'screen', 'performances.This', 'film', 'garnered', 'many', 'plaudits', 'including', 'one', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'whilst', 'should', 'be', 'praised', 'high', 'art', 'value', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'bodies', 'cup', 'tea', 'actually', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'put', 'most', 'people', 'off', 'tea', 'scenes', 'also', 'not', 'pornographic', 'filmed', 'such', 'straightforward', 'fashion', 'sense', 'eroticism', 'study', 'someone', 'actually', 'losing', 'same', 'time', 'being', 'very', 'loving', 'Convincing', 'performances', 'round', 'especially', 'Monica', 'de', 'Carmen', 'language', 'Spanish', 'Mexican', 'excellent', 'sub', 'titles', 'run', 'time', '92', 'minutes', 'So', 'want', 'bit', 'truly', 'art', 'house', 'original', 'world', 'cinema', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'will', 'want', 'see']",Leap Year
