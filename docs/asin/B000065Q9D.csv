Starkey in this exciting documentary complete with Starkey's penetrating presentation, historic locations and wonderful dramatic presentations begins with Elizabeth I's  birth and her perilous childhood as well as her skill since early childhood at speech and diplomacy.We observe the continued danger during the reigns of her brother Edward VI, and particularly her sister Mary I (Bloody Mary) , times in which she came under suspicion of being involved in treasonous plots and was closely watched and kept in semi-captivity.We observe how she was sexually abused by her stepfather Thomas Seymour, and the resultant interrogations  she suffered. this documentary also demonstrates how close she came to the scaffold during her sister Mary's reign.It is an account of how in 45 years she took England from being a weak,impoverished and divided country and with the able assistance of her chief  minister William Cecil she overcame all her difficulties making a religious settlement some way towards satisfying both Protestants and Catholics and fending off England's enemies, particularly Spain and France while building up England into a formidable power and building up that country's navy.Starkey does not spare her criticism and shows her negative qualities of cunning and the ruthlessness which she put down the he Rising of the North of 1569. Good focus on Mary Queen of Scots (played by the very pretty S&eacute;ana Montague) but strangely enough while Elizabeth (Karen Archer) is shown as ageing , the recreation of Mary at her trial 20 years after her captivity at Fotheringham shows her as young and beautiful as the early footage of Seana as Mary.Starkey explains how Mary was trapped by the cunning Francis Walsingham into agreeing to a plot against Elizabeth, and the reluctance with which Elizabeth agreed to execute Mary. She also seemed to be greatly remorseful after she signed Mary's death warrant, but Starkey seems to think some of her anguish was crocodile tears.Powerful footage of England's dramatic victory over the invading Spanish Armada in 1588. Very interesting here is how we see firstly how unpopular Elizabeth was towards the end of her reign and how close Robert Devereaux, erstwhile favourite of elizabeth came to deposing her in his attempted coup de tat.Also great portrayal of Elizabeth's stubborn refusal to take to bead in her last days. At a time when English history is being downscaled in schools and universities in order not to offend certain groups, the English children and young people are being robbed of a central part of their heritage and identity. Series like these are welcome and refreshing.",5,Welcome and compelling,1375228800,"07 31, 2013",2013,2772,"['really', 'consummate', 'compelling', 'journey', 'David', 'Starkey', 'charting', 'amazing', 'life', 'one', 'England', 'greatest', 'monarchs', 'Starkey', 'exciting', 'documentary', 'complete', 'Starkey', 'penetrating', 'presentation', 'historic', 'locations', 'wonderful', 'dramatic', 'presentations', 'Elizabeth', 'birth', 'perilous', 'childhood', 'as', 'well', 'skill', 'early', 'childhood', 'speech', 'diplomacy.We', 'observe', 'continued', 'danger', 'reigns', 'brother', 'Edward', 'VI', 'particularly', 'sister', 'Mary', 'Bloody', 'Mary', 'times', 'came', 'suspicion', 'being', 'involved', 'treasonous', 'plots', 'was', 'closely', 'watched', 'kept', 'semi-captivity.We', 'observe', 'how', 'was', 'sexually', 'abused', 'stepfather', 'Thomas', 'Seymour', 'resultant', 'interrogations', 'suffered', 'documentary', 'also', 'how', 'close', 'came', 'scaffold', 'sister', 'Mary', 'reign.It', 'account', 'how', '45', 'years', 'took', 'England', 'being', 'weak', 'impoverished', 'divided', 'country', 'able', 'assistance', 'chief', 'minister', 'William', 'Cecil', 'overcame', 'difficulties', 'making', 'religious', 'settlement', 'way', 'satisfying', 'Protestants', 'Catholics', 'fending', 'off', 'England', 'enemies', 'particularly', 'Spain', 'France', 'building', 'up', 'England', 'formidable', 'power', 'building', 'up', 'country', 'navy.Starkey', 'not', 'spare', 'criticism', 'negative', 'qualities', 'cunning', 'ruthlessness', 'put', 'down', 'Rising', 'North', '1569', 'Good', 'focus', 'Mary', 'Queen', 'Scots', 'played', 'very', 'pretty', 'S', 'eacute', 'Montague', 'strangely', 'enough', 'Elizabeth', 'Karen', 'Archer', 'shown', 'ageing', 'recreation', 'Mary', 'trial', '20', 'years', 'captivity', 'Fotheringham', 'young', 'beautiful', 'early', 'footage', 'Seana', 'Mary.Starkey', 'how', 'Mary', 'was', 'trapped', 'cunning', 'Francis', 'Walsingham', 'agreeing', 'plot', 'Elizabeth', 'reluctance', 'Elizabeth', 'agreed', 'execute', 'Mary', 'also', 'seemed', 'be', 'greatly', 'remorseful', 'signed', 'Mary', 'death', 'warrant', 'Starkey', 'think', 'anguish', 'was', 'crocodile', 'tears.Powerful', 'footage', 'England', 'dramatic', 'victory', 'invading', 'Spanish', 'Armada', '1588', 'Very', 'interesting', 'here', 'how', 'see', 'firstly', 'how', 'unpopular', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'end', 'reign', 'how', 'close', 'Robert', 'Devereaux', 'erstwhile', 'favourite', 'elizabeth', 'came', 'deposing', 'attempted', 'coup', 'de', 'tat.Also', 'great', 'portrayal', 'Elizabeth', 'stubborn', 'refusal', 'take', 'bead', 'last', 'days', 'time', 'when', 'English', 'history', 'being', 'downscaled', 'schools', 'universities', 'order', 'not', 'offend', 'certain', 'groups', 'English', 'children', 'young', 'people', 'are', 'being', 'robbed', 'central', 'part', 'heritage', 'identity', 'Series', 'are', 'welcome', 'refreshing']",N/A

It is in two parts, with David Starkey narrating it. This documentary is not boring and it uses actors/actresses to act out various points. Of course this should not be taken as a be all end all discussion on Queen Elizabeth but it offers great insight and historical knowledge of the great Queen.

It is not a drama, uses actors primarily without words under narration to tell the life story of Elizabeth.  I have watched this several times over.Similar to other David Starkey narrated histories, there are trace comments which really SHOULD be followed up on, things stated as fact that would be hard to prove outside of conjecture.  Some of today's pasty titled folks are trotted out and one wonders how much of an authority they really are, when they mistranslate simple phrases... but that also brings life and light to the ""mystique"" of station, to see that these really are just people.The actors are well used, and when they do get to speak, they shine.  I especially like that they used two actresses, one for young Elizabeth, another for older.

Schweitzer ""zohoe""","[154, 161]","This History Channel four part documentary on the life of the famous Virgin Queen, Elizabeth I is an excellent addition to any history enthusiast's video library.  Combining commentary with well-done re-enactments, this mini-series chronicles the rise and reign of the most famous queen in history, Elizabeth Tudor, daughter of King Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.  This series follows her life from her childhood, where she was raised as a lady in a man's world, tossed about after the death of her father, to whom she was devoted, and ultimately spending her adolescence trying to fend off the advances of her step-father.  After suffering through the reign on her virulently Catholic half-sister, ""Bloody"" Mary, Elizabeth finally ascends to the throne of England in time to fend off conspiracies, rebellions, and marriage proposals.  We then follow as Elizabeth grows into a powerful and intelligent queen, first by putting down a rebellion instigated by Mary, Queen of Scots, then outmanuevering Spain's Phillip II and defeating his great Armada in the English Channel.  Elizabeth's life is a fascinating and entertaining piece of history and this wonderful DVD series does it great justice.

On-location photography in the United Kingdom and Ireland, well-done reenactments, artwork, and the superb narration of historian David Starkey make it possible for viewers to get a better appreciation for Queen Elizabeth I and the impact of her reign on British, European, and world history.  Starkey clearly explains how Elizabeth Tudor, daughter of King Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, managed to become queen in 1558 C.E. through courage, cunning, and luck.  Starkey also shows with conviction that unlike her cousin Mary Stewart, Queen of Scots, Elizabeth I, a Protestant, was an astute politician both domestically and overseas during her nearly 45-year rule.  England became a major European power under Elizabeth I's reign.  Paradoxically, Mary Stewart, the figurehead of Catholicism, got the last word after her execution for high treason against Elizabeth I in 1587 C.E.  Elizabeth I died heirless in 1603 C.E.  Mary Stewart's son, James VI of Scotland, became King of England and Scotland as James I after the death of Elizabeth I.
