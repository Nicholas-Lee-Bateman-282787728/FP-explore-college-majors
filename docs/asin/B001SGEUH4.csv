I'm a huge slasher movie fan, so usually if others like a slasher movie I will too. Sadly, I didn't like The Last Horror Film. It has three things going for it: Caroline Munro, the awesome music, and a surprise ending. Everyone else from the script to the low body count is a bore.

1234906,A2ZV6W9M5HDPJZ,B001SGEUH4,Ron,"[7, 9]","""The Last Horror Film"" aka ""Fanatic"", is about a taxi driver from New York named Vinny who's obsessed with the famous actress, Jana Bates. He leaves his mother after getting up money to go to the Cannes Film Festival to try and get her into a moie that he wrote, the only problem is he can't get to her. Now what do you do in a situation where you're obsessed with an actress but you can't get close because of heavy security? Go to anyone associated with her. He comes in contact with many people around her including her ex-husband, agent, producer, and others. And wadya know, they all turn up dead, starting with Jana's ex and director, but no one does much about the deaths because they think they're all just part of a joke. Now that everyone around her is dead Jana is free for Vinny's taking and it all comes down to the superior ending!This film is great! It's definantly not your typical independent film. It's more! Alot more! You see the main character Vinny start to slowly crack and descend into complete madness. He calls his mother from time to time and breaks down. This film has less gore but more story than ""Maniac"".

1234909,A2GHH8L0APUT09,B001SGEUH4,"Tomas Rodriguez ""Orange Jester""","[0, 0]","My girlfriend knew I liked cult horror films and picked this film up for me as a Christmas gift. I had seen previews of it and read many positive reviews, but hadn't gotten around to seeing it. I watched it recently and found it to be good, but feel it could have been better.Joe Spinell is amazing in this movie. I don't think anybody can pull of the creepy loner quite like he can. The way Spinell gestures, speaks and moans...a true master at his character. At times you think he really is this person and not playing a part. The gore effects are really good in this as well, classic 80's style. A lot of the ""deaths"" are shots of films being shown at the Cannes Film Festival which is a cool effect.Joe plays Vinny, a man obsessed with a horror film actress named Jenna Bates (played by Caroline Munro) that he wants to put in his movie. He feels that she is being misused and believes he has the perfect part for her to play. He tries to get through to her, but is continually shunned by everyone. The only other person Vinny seems to care about is his mother (who is in fact, played by Joe's real life mother) who he calls often. She tells him to give up on his crazy dreams, but he is determined to show her and everyone else his genius.As the film progresses, it begs the question as to who is the killer. Is it Vinny, who keeps stalking the actress and everyone associated with her, or is it someone else? There are a lot of creepy shots of Vinny stalking her (shown in black and white and accompanied by very sinister heavy breathing) as well as some extremely disturbing shots of Vinny having nervous psychotic breakdowns.There are however, some flaws with this film. The acting (aside from Spinell) is poor even by horror movie standards. Quite a few shots seem to have very little purpose besides making the film a few minutes longer. There are many places where the films slows down and it can get pretty boring. It picks up around the 45 minutes mark and from then on the film really gets exciting. Some of the footage is also very dark, making it hard to see what exactly is going on. I know some of this footage is restored and of poor quality, so I can forgive it since it makes the film complete. I might be nitpicking this, but I really did NOT enjoy the ""twist"" ending.All in all, this is a good cult film that I think many will enjoy this and true horror fans should check out. It's not the best, but it certainly is worth a look.",3,A Pretty Good Horror Film,1303948800,"04 28, 2011",2011,2452,"['girlfriend', 'knew', 'liked', 'cult', 'horror', 'films', 'picked', 'film', 'up', 'Christmas', 'gift', 'had', 'seen', 'previews', 'read', 'many', 'positive', 'reviews', 'had', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'seeing', 'watched', 'recently', 'found', 'be', 'good', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better.Joe', 'Spinell', 'amazing', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anybody', 'can', 'pull', 'creepy', 'quite', 'can', 'way', 'Spinell', 'gestures', 'speaks', 'moans', 'true', 'master', 'character', 'times', 'think', 'really', 'person', 'not', 'playing', 'part', 'gore', 'effects', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'classic', '80', 'style', 'lot', 'deaths', 'are', 'shots', 'films', 'being', 'shown', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'cool', 'effect.Joe', 'plays', 'Vinny', 'man', 'obsessed', 'horror', 'film', 'actress', 'named', 'Jenna', 'Bates', 'played', 'Caroline', 'Munro', 'put', 'movie', 'being', 'misused', 'perfect', 'part', 'play', 'get', 'continually', 'shunned', 'everyone', 'only', 'other', 'person', 'Vinny', 'care', 'mother', 'who', 'fact', 'played', 'Joe', 'real', 'life', 'mother', 'who', 'often', 'give', 'up', 'crazy', 'dreams', 'determined', 'show', 'everyone', 'else', 'genius.As', 'film', 'question', 'who', 'killer', 'Vinny', 'who', 'stalking', 'actress', 'everyone', 'associated', 'someone', 'else', 'are', 'lot', 'creepy', 'shots', 'Vinny', 'stalking', 'shown', 'black', 'white', 'accompanied', 'very', 'sinister', 'heavy', 'breathing', 'as', 'well', 'extremely', 'disturbing', 'shots', 'Vinny', 'having', 'nervous', 'psychotic', 'breakdowns.There', 'are', 'however', 'flaws', 'film', 'acting', 'aside', 'Spinell', 'poor', 'even', 'horror', 'movie', 'standards', 'few', 'shots', 'seem', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'purpose', 'making', 'film', 'few', 'minutes', 'longer', 'are', 'many', 'places', 'where', 'films', 'down', 'can', 'get', 'pretty', 'boring', 'up', '45', 'minutes', 'mark', 'then', 'film', 'really', 'exciting', 'footage', 'also', 'very', 'dark', 'making', 'hard', 'see', 'what', 'exactly', 'going', 'know', 'footage', 'restored', 'poor', 'quality', 'can', 'forgive', 'film', 'complete', 'might', 'be', 'nitpicking', 'really', 'did', 'NOT', 'enjoy', 'twist', 'ending.All', 'good', 'cult', 'film', 'think', 'many', 'will', 'enjoy', 'true', 'horror', 'fans', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'not', 'best', 'certainly', 'look']",The Last Horror Film
1234910,A2VYWLTNR8JORA,B001SGEUH4,what could have been,"[0, 0]","Let me preface by saying that I adore the late Mr. Spinell (Rocky I&II;, Taxi Driver, The Godfather Part II, Taxi Driver, and MANIAC!). And judging by various documentaries on Joe Spinell, he was well loved by many people. His friends speak kindly and fondly of him as an entertainer, person and friend. I have a feeling that he was larger than life in real life; his early passing is a shame.With all of that being said, I have to judge a product fairly. My Spinell bias aside, this is not a fantastic horror film by any means. On the other hand, it's not terrible either. In some ways it actually falls into the ""so bad, it's good"" category, as many beloved cult films do. If you enjoyed Spinell's performance in Maniac, then I highly recommend this (previously obscure) little film. But if you are unfamiliar with his work, I'd say watch William Lustwig's ""Maniac"" first. Is it fair to compare Maniac and The Last Horror Film? I think it is, as Spinell's ""Vinny"" of TLHF is very much in the same vein of Maniac's ""Frank."" Though as much as the characters are similar, there are differences too. It seems that Spinell relishes playing the deranged guy so much that he actually treads the fine line of parody in this film. Maybe it is intentional, as there are comedic elements to TLHF? The meat of what I am trying to convey is that this is basically camp. I do not see it being appreciated by all. Maniac, though uneven in its thematic elements and story-line (The Anna and Frank romance is jarring to the vibe of the film), is a fairly unsettling and frightening film, despite the fact that it was made in 1980. Though The Last Horror Film was made a few years later, it feels far more dated and nonchalant than Maniac. In some ways, The Last Horror Film plays slight homage to the giallo film genre (Argento, Fulci, etc.). There are twists and all in all, I'd call this a ""fun"" horror film; it's nothing to be taken too seriously.I understand that the poor transfer is due to piecing the film together as best as they could in order to deliver the full film to us, but the overall film experience is dulled. Certain scenes are extremely dark (literally) and blurry/GRAINY. And other scenes either feature lines throughout the film or shaking. It's almost as if watching a VHS tape on DVD. If you've ever seen the uncut ""Silent Night, Deadly Night,"" you'll get an idea of what I am speaking of.There are extras included and they are great. ""My favorite Maniac"" is a (very) free form documentary featuring Joe anecdotes via a longtime friend; it's touching and humorous.",4,"A *must* for Joe Spinell fans, but not necessarily a ""must have"" otherwise.",1355961600,"12 20, 2012",2012,2573,"['Let', 'preface', 'saying', 'adore', 'late', 'Mr.', 'Spinell', 'Rocky', 'II', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'Godfather', 'Part', 'II', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'MANIAC', 'judging', 'various', 'documentaries', 'Joe', 'Spinell', 'was', 'well', 'loved', 'many', 'people', 'friends', 'speak', 'kindly', 'fondly', 'entertainer', 'person', 'friend', 'have', 'feeling', 'was', 'larger', 'life', 'real', 'life', 'early', 'passing', 'shame.With', 'being', 'said', 'have', 'judge', 'product', 'fairly', 'My', 'Spinell', 'bias', 'aside', 'not', 'fantastic', 'horror', 'film', 'means', 'other', 'hand', 'not', 'terrible', 'either', 'ways', 'actually', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'category', 'many', 'beloved', 'cult', 'films', 'do', 'enjoyed', 'Spinell', 'performance', 'Maniac', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend', 'previously', 'obscure', 'little', 'film', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'work', ""'d"", 'say', 'watch', 'William', 'Lustwig', 'Maniac', 'first', 'fair', 'compare', 'Maniac', 'Last', 'Horror', 'Film', 'think', 'Spinell', 'Vinny', 'TLHF', 'very', 'much', 'same', 'vein', 'Maniac', 'Frank', 'as', 'much', 'characters', 'are', 'similar', 'are', 'differences', 'too', 'Spinell', 'playing', 'deranged', 'guy', 'so', 'much', 'actually', 'fine', 'line', 'parody', 'film', 'Maybe', 'intentional', 'are', 'comedic', 'elements', 'TLHF', 'meat', 'what', 'am', 'trying', 'convey', 'basically', 'camp', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'being', 'appreciated', 'Maniac', 'though', 'uneven', 'thematic', 'elements', 'story-line', 'Anna', 'Frank', 'romance', 'jarring', 'vibe', 'film', 'fairly', 'unsettling', 'frightening', 'film', 'fact', 'was', 'made', '1980', 'Last', 'Horror', 'Film', 'was', 'made', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'far', 'more', 'dated', 'nonchalant', 'Maniac', 'ways', 'Last', 'Horror', 'Film', 'plays', 'slight', 'homage', 'giallo', 'film', 'genre', 'Argento', 'Fulci', 'etc.', 'are', 'twists', ""'d"", 'call', 'fun', 'horror', 'film', 'nothing', 'be', 'taken', 'too', 'seriously.I', 'understand', 'poor', 'transfer', 'due', 'piecing', 'film', 'together', 'as', 'best', 'could', 'order', 'deliver', 'full', 'film', 'overall', 'film', 'experience', 'dulled', 'Certain', 'scenes', 'are', 'extremely', 'dark', 'literally', 'blurry/GRAINY', 'other', 'scenes', 'feature', 'lines', 'film', 'shaking', 'almost', 'watching', 'VHS', 'tape', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'uncut', 'Silent', 'Night', 'Deadly', 'Night', ""'ll"", 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'am', 'speaking', 'are', 'extras', 'included', 'are', 'great', 'favorite', 'Maniac', 'very', 'free', 'form', 'documentary', 'featuring', 'Joe', 'longtime', 'friend', 'touching', 'humorous']",The Last Horror Film
