1553667,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B008I34Y3K,Brent Butler,"[3, 4]","This was one of my favorite TV series as a kid, and my first substantial exposure to Robert Wagner. He was ""super-cool"" as Alexander Mundy, the master thief co-opted by the ""SIA"". His task: simple. Work for them when and as needed to steal things for US Intelligence, or go back to prison.If you are on this product page, though, I'm guessing you were a fan of the series too, or at least already know enough about it to be interested in this product, so I'm going to focus the bulk of my review on the presentation in this DVD set.First, the picture quality is for the most part pretty sharp. There is a trick here though. Most modern DVD/blu ray players, receivers, and TV sets are going to try to stretch this 4:3 ratio picture to 16:9. If you watch this at 16:9 it is going to look VERY grainy. So take a moment to set your TV to show it in 4:3. You'll be glad you did.Second, even at 4:3, it's going to look somewhat grainy. That's because this was filmed for much smaller TVs in the late 60s and early 70s. You may be watching it on one of the current big screens. Stock footage used by the directors will look especially bad, but there isn't much to do about that.There was little to no restoration from the source material. Film damage is evident in the presence of streaks and spots that occasionally show up.One thing that disappointed me a lot is that they chose to use a version of the pilot that had been chopped up for syndication. Approximately THIRTY-FOUR minutes of the original footage is missing from the pilot shown in this set. And those missing minutes are not inconsequential. Once the cuts start, you really can't follow the details of the story anymore. You don't know how the characters are finding out the next place to be in solving the mystery. They just ""show up"" there. In the real pilot, that is all laid out so that the viewer is not confused. In one spot in this presentation, Noah Bain is presented with a broken window pane that was taped up before it was broken. He remarks that the tape job is classic Mundy style. Well, in the FULL pilot, you get to see Mundy tape the glass, perform the break in, and find the clue that ties his scenes together. Here, he's just in one place, then inexplicably in the next. So if you can find an alternate source for the pilot, do so.Other episodes look to be running 50-51 minutes, so they should be the full episodes. I'm not as familiar with the details of ALL the episodes to the degree I was the pilot movie, but that would have been about the correct running time (less the commercials) for an hour long show at that point in TV history.By the way, the studio went all out for this pilot. It's full of delightful cameos ... if you are a fan of 60s TV. Wally Cox shows up as an airline customer. James Drury and Doug McClure are ticket agents. Leslie Neilsen is a security officer. You'll also see actors such as Raymond Burr and Stuart Margolin. There are a few more, and I don't want to spoil ALL the surprises. :-)My qualms with the chopped up pilot aside, there are plenty of shows AFTER that which are not chopped up. After the pilot, some of the sets get a little bare bones, but that was 60s TV budgeting for you. There are loads of great guest stars, and of course every show has the ultra suave Robert Wagner. There are plenty of entertaining theft sequences, plenty of pretty ladies, and interesting bad guys galore.This series is almost certainly the inspiration for the currently popular USA series ""White Collar"", and the same premise was used for the short-lived Billy D. Williams series ""Double Dare"".Recommended.",4,"Great series, just OK reproduction quality",1370476800,"06 6, 2013",2013,3606,"['was', 'one', 'favorite', 'TV', 'series', 'kid', 'first', 'substantial', 'exposure', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'was', 'super-cool', 'Alexander', 'Mundy', 'master', 'thief', 'co-opted', 'SIA', 'task', 'simple', 'Work', 'when', 'as', 'needed', 'steal', 'things', 'US', 'Intelligence', 'go', 'back', 'prison.If', 'are', 'product', 'page', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'were', 'fan', 'series', 'too', 'least', 'already', 'know', 'enough', 'be', 'interested', 'product', ""'m"", 'going', 'focus', 'bulk', 'review', 'presentation', 'DVD', 'set.First', 'picture', 'quality', 'most', 'part', 'pretty', 'sharp', 'trick', 'here', 'Most', 'modern', 'DVD/blu', 'ray', 'players', 'receivers', 'TV', 'sets', 'are', 'going', 'try', 'stretch', '4:3', 'ratio', 'picture', '16:9', 'watch', '16:9', 'going', 'look', 'VERY', 'grainy', 'So', 'take', 'moment', 'set', 'TV', 'show', '4:3', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'did.Second', 'even', '4:3', 'going', 'look', 'somewhat', 'grainy', 'was', 'filmed', 'much', 'smaller', 'TVs', 'late', '60s', 'early', '70s', 'may', 'be', 'watching', 'one', 'current', 'big', 'screens', 'Stock', 'footage', 'used', 'directors', 'will', 'look', 'especially', 'bad', ""n't"", 'much', 'do', 'that.There', 'was', 'little', 'restoration', 'source', 'material', 'Film', 'damage', 'evident', 'presence', 'streaks', 'spots', 'occasionally', 'show', 'up.One', 'thing', 'disappointed', 'lot', 'chose', 'use', 'version', 'pilot', 'had', 'been', 'chopped', 'up', 'syndication', 'Approximately', 'THIRTY-FOUR', 'minutes', 'original', 'footage', 'missing', 'pilot', 'shown', 'set', 'missing', 'minutes', 'are', 'not', 'inconsequential', 'cuts', 'start', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'follow', 'details', 'story', 'anymore', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'characters', 'are', 'finding', 'next', 'place', 'be', 'solving', 'mystery', 'just', 'show', 'up', 'there', 'real', 'pilot', 'laid', 'out', 'so', 'viewer', 'not', 'confused', 'one', 'spot', 'presentation', 'Noah', 'Bain', 'presented', 'broken', 'window', 'pane', 'was', 'taped', 'up', 'was', 'broken', 'remarks', 'tape', 'job', 'classic', 'Mundy', 'style', 'Well', 'FULL', 'pilot', 'get', 'see', 'Mundy', 'tape', 'glass', 'perform', 'break', 'find', 'clue', 'scenes', 'together', 'Here', 'just', 'one', 'place', 'then', 'inexplicably', 'next', 'So', 'can', 'find', 'alternate', 'source', 'pilot', 'do', 'so.Other', 'episodes', 'look', 'be', 'running', '50-51', 'minutes', 'should', 'be', 'full', 'episodes', ""'m"", 'not', 'familiar', 'details', 'episodes', 'degree', 'was', 'pilot', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'correct', 'running', 'time', 'commercials', 'hour', 'long', 'show', 'point', 'TV', 'history.By', 'way', 'studio', 'went', 'out', 'pilot', 'full', 'delightful', 'cameos', 'are', 'fan', '60s', 'TV', 'Wally', 'Cox', 'up', 'airline', 'customer', 'James', 'Drury', 'Doug', 'McClure', 'are', 'ticket', 'agents', 'Leslie', 'Neilsen', 'security', 'officer', ""'ll"", 'also', 'see', 'actors', 'such', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'Stuart', 'Margolin', 'are', 'few', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'surprises', 'qualms', 'chopped', 'up', 'pilot', 'aside', 'are', 'plenty', 'shows', 'AFTER', 'are', 'not', 'chopped', 'up', 'pilot', 'sets', 'get', 'little', 'bare', 'bones', 'was', '60s', 'TV', 'budgeting', 'are', 'loads', 'great', 'guest', 'stars', 'course', 'show', 'ultra', 'suave', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'are', 'plenty', 'entertaining', 'theft', 'sequences', 'plenty', 'pretty', 'ladies', 'interesting', 'bad', 'guys', 'galore.This', 'series', 'almost', 'certainly', 'inspiration', 'currently', 'popular', 'USA', 'series', 'White', 'Collar', 'same', 'premise', 'was', 'used', 'short-lived', 'Billy', 'D.', 'Williams', 'series', 'Double', 'Dare', '.Recommended']",N/A

1553677,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B008I34Y3K,trebe,"[6, 7]","With Robert Wagner (Hart to Hart, Switch) starring as master thief Al Mundy, the action adventure series It Takes a Thief (1968-70), ran for three seasons on ABC.  Created by Roland Kibbe, the program was a midseason replacement that premiered in January of 1968, producing 16 episodes in its first season.  Hitchcock's classic thriller,To Catch a Thief(1955), supposedly provided the inspiration for Al Mundy, a cool, classy, and handsome gentleman crook and cat burglar.The familiar pattern for the series is established in the 64 minute pilot ""Magnificent Thief"", where Al Mundy is doing time in prison, when Noah Bain (Malachi Throne) of the SIA (Secret Intelligence Agency), a branch of US intelligence, springs him from behind bars, and presents him with a unique proposition.  In return for his release from incarceration, Mundy agrees to carry out missions for the SIA, utilizing his singular talents as a con artist and master thief.  Mundy is placed under house arrest in a residence near Washington D.C., where he is watched on closed circuit TV, and supervised by various female SIA agents.  His first assignment for Bain is to recover a secret list of SIA agents.  The pilot features cameos by Raymond Burr, Wally Cox, James Drury, Doug McClure and Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson.  The episode works up to a point, but the story suffers, because a huge portion was cut, fortunately the full 89 minute version is included as a bonus.The premise of a man living in a gilded cage, while being forced to steal and engage in espionage, to preserve his freedom, is remarkably intriguing.  More so, because Al Mundy not a trained operative, and doesn't like guns or violence.  Appearing at the tail end of the ""spy craze"", following in the wake of programs like Mission Impossible, and The Man From U.N.C.L.E., audiences were already well acquainted with the scenarios found on It Takes a Thief.  The big differences were that rather than a team or organization, the focus was on just one man, and It Takes a Thief brought a comedic spin, to what were supposedly deadly serious missions.Mundy's semi-adversarial relationship with Noah Bain, is also a key element in the series' appeal.  Constantly putting Al in danger, and threatening to send him back to prison, Malachi Throne adroitly plays a character that is sometimes hard to like.  From the start, realism wasn't a serious consideration, as the program was mostly escapist fare, with the dashing and charismatic Mundy operating with great style and daring, harassing Noah when appropriate, and as time permits, stealing the hearts of as many women as possible.Generally featuring outlandish plots, and often set in fictional foreign lands, the series was shot on location, and also on the expansive Universal Studios lot.  Wagner assumed a wide variety of roles, often involving impersonations, disguises, exaggerated accents, or ""hipster"" talk used in completely inappropriate situations.  Cool gadgetry is occasionally featured, but Mundy mostly relied on his unique skills.  While more of a lover than a fighter, Wagner does well enough in action scenes, and performing minor stunts.The series featured an outstanding lineup of guest stars, including a continuous string of devastatingly beautiful women.  It's tough for Al Mundy to get romantic with Bain and his SIA staff around, but when operating in the field, Mundy has more opportunities to employ his charms.  Things rarely go smoothly, as there is usually a bit of friction between Al and his female partners, which typically makes for some really entertaining adventures.  These include ""When Good Friends Get Together"" featuring Rosemary Forsythe, ""A Matter of Royal Larceny"" with a sassy Lynda Day, and ""When Thieves Fall In"" with the fabulous Susan St. James.  Celeste Yarnall has excellent rapport with Wagner in ""Locked In the Cradle of the Keep"", and a pre-Brady Eve Plum guests in one of the best episodes of the season, ""The Radomir Miniature"".The musical theme by Dave Grusin is brilliant, and the show's musical score is lively and fun, and hopefully will be made available someday.  The four disc set contains 16 episodes, plus the extended 89 minute version of the pilot, ""Magnificent Thief"" which features a radical reworking of the plot, and many additional scenes with co-star Senta Berger (The Ambushers,The Quiller Memorandum).  Overall, the image quality for the series varies quite a bit.  Color saturation is generally good, but occasionally appears washed out.  Sharpness is usually decent, but there are times when there is excessive grain, or sharpness suffers.  Unfortunately, the episodes are not subtitled.While it has serious aspects, It Takes A Thief also has a lighter side, that makes for a nice change of pace from other series involving spies and espionage.  Al Mundy is an intriguing and extremely likeable character, and you really get to see Robert Wagner's talents on full display, and the fabulous guest cast, keeps things lively and exciting, in this classic 60's adventure.",4,meet the charming Al Mundy...,1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,5033,"['Robert', 'Wagner', 'Hart', 'Hart', 'Switch', 'starring', 'master', 'thief', 'Al', 'Mundy', 'action',
