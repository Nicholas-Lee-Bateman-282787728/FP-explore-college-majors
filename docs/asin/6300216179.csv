I mean, how many of us have been delayed at the airport, problems with our rental cars, lost/stolen credit cards, etc.This movie reminds me of my own disastrous trip to DC one year (2003), when EVERYTHING WENT WRONG.  I slept in the airport terminal all weekend with no money and the airlines wouldnt put me up on an earlier flight home unless I had the ticket price difference.

His character (as far as I see it) is obviously written to be played way, way over the top. That's what makes it funny. Realistically, we have to know that all 64 (or so) crises and maladies that befall this poor midwestern couple could not ALL happen at once in a million years. So, therefore, I think the viewer must look upon Lemmon as more of a ""caricature"" than a ""character"" in this film.Most of this movie was filmed outdoors, and there's a nice ""Big Apple"" flavor here (circa 1970).Some of my favorite lines of dialogue from ""The Out-Of-Towners"":Lemmon (upon hearing his luggage didn't arrive): ""Well you flew ME through the fog! How come you're now worried about two leather valises?!""Lemmon (after frisking little boy in bushes searching for funds): ""...Explain to the police? What I was doing in the woods with a little boy...with my hands in his pockets?!? They'd give me twenty years!""",5,"""You're Not Gettin' Away With Anything!

In fact, no remake or sequel of any classic movie has ever been better than the original, so it's a huge waste of time quality-wise, done only to rake in a few extra bucks from ignorant young viewers whom the producers hope won't get wise to the scam too soon.The Out-Of-Towners doesn't just illustrate how New York sucks (if you're not rich) but that all big cities suck for the average person. Sure it's done as a dark comedy, but beneath the humor the lesson is still there that cities should stay smaller and more workable; whenever they get too huge they always turn into an unwieldy maze of inefficiency and nightmarish confusion.So if you live in a nice, comfy small town like the Ohio one Lemmon does in this movie, and your company someday decides to give you a corporate pat on the back, tell them thanks for the compliment but that you AIN'T going to any big city to collect it!",3,Vintage sour Lemmon,1070150400,"11 30, 2003",2003,1207,"['Simply', 'put', 'movie', 'one', 'half', 'dozen', 'films', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', '.And', 'modern', 'Hollywood', 'trying', 'grind', 'out', 'remakes', 'such', 'classics', 'one', 'only', 'today', 'studios', 'are', 'so', 'emptied', 'ideas', 'resort', 'robbing', 'graves', 'much', 'better', 'done', 'films', 'fact', 'remake', 'sequel', 'classic', 'movie', 'ever', 'been', 'better', 'original', 'huge', 'waste', 'time', 'quality-wise', 'done', 'only', 'rake', 'few', 'extra', 'bucks', 'ignorant', 'young', 'viewers', 'whom', 'producers', 'hope', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'wise', 'scam', 'too', 'soon.The', 'Out-Of-Towners', ""n't"", 'just', 'illustrate', 'how', 'New', 'York', 'sucks', ""'re"", 'not', 'rich', 'big', 'cities', 'suck', 'average', 'person', 'Sure', 'done', 'dark', 'comedy', 'humor', 'lesson', 'still', 'cities', 'should', 'stay', 'smaller', 'more', 'workable', 'whenever', 'get', 'too', 'huge', 'always', 'turn', 'unwieldy', 'maze', 'inefficiency', 'nightmarish', 'confusion.So', 'live', 'nice', 'comfy', 'small', 'town', 'Ohio', 'one', 'Lemmon', 'movie', 'company', 'someday', 'give', 'corporate', 'pat', 'back', 'tell', 'thanks', 'compliment', 'AI', ""N'T"", 'going', 'big', 'city', 'collect']",The Out-of-Towners VHS
220124,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6300216179,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 2]","Just before tackling the treacle of ""Love Story"", journeyman director Arthur Hiller did a pretty decent job maneuvering this kinetic 1970 Neil Simon-penned comedy. The movie follows the misadventures of the Kellermans, an Ohio couple who journey to New York City because husband George is up for a much anticipated VP promotion in his plastics company. Wife Gwen is supportive but reticent about coming to the big city, and it turns out her hesitations are well founded. First, their flight is rerouted to Boston, and then they are crowded onto a commuter train to Grand Central Station where they are in the midst of a transit strike. The Kellermans get kidnapped in a squad car and then mugged. The Waldorf-Astoria has given away their room, and they have to spend a night in Central Park where they get mugged for a second time. George chips his front tooth on a Cracker Jack while Gwen suffers from weak ankles. The clock continues to click until George's appointment with the company president.In typically manic form, Jack Lemmon has to play a complete jerk as George, and he luckily does not go soft with his character as he faces one indignity after another. It's just that he starts to sound more like a Neil Simon character than a real human being after a while. The shamefully underused Sandy Dennis effectively plays Gwen with cautious subservience from the outset but gradually makes her character funnier by turning her into a whining neurotic. Both actors use their familiar mannerisms maximally here, but more importantly, they are completely credible as a suburban married couple who have to lean on each other throughout. Hiller smartly uses real locations and captures an urban grittiness that makes sense within this story. Quincy Jones provides the jazzy background music here. John Hughes' partial knock-off, the equally hilarious ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" (1987), bears a more than passing resemblance to this film. Unfortunately there are no extras with the 2003 DVD.",4,Urban Nightmare Comes Alive Thanks to Neil Simon's Familiar Pen in Still-Funny Comedy,1159920000,"10 4, 2006",2006,1998,"['Just', 'tackling', 'treacle', 'Love', 'Story', 'journeyman', 'director', 'Arthur', 'Hiller', 'did', 'pretty', 'decent', 'job', 'maneuvering', 'kinetic', '1970', 'Neil', 'Simon-penned', 'comedy', 'movie', 'misadventures', 'Kellermans', 'Ohio', 'couple', 'who', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'husband', 'George', 'up', 'much', 'anticipated', 'VP', 'promotion', 'plastics', 'company', 'Wife', 'Gwen', 'supportive', 'reticent', 'coming', 'big', 'city', 'out', 'hesitations', 'are', 'well', 'founded', 'First', 'flight', 'rerouted', 'Boston', 'then', 'are', 'crowded', 'commuter', 'train', 'Grand', 'Central', 'Station', 'where', 'are', 'midst', 'transit', 'strike', 'Kellermans', 'get', 'kidnapped', 'squad', 'car', 'then', 'mugged', 'Waldorf-Astoria', 'given', 'away', 'room', 'have', 'spend', 'night', 'Central', 'Park', 'where', 'get', 'mugged', 'second', 'time', 'George', 'chips', 'front', 'tooth', 'Cracker', 'Jack', 'Gwen', 'suffers', 'weak', 'ankles', 'clock', 'click', 'George', 'appointment', 'company', 'president.In', 'typically', 'manic', 'form', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'play', 'complete', 'jerk', 'George', 'luckily', 'not', 'go', 'soft', 'character', 'one', 'indignity', 'just', 'sound', 'more', 'Neil', 'Simon', 'character', 'real', 'human', 'being', 'while', 'shamefully', 'underused', 'Sandy', 'Dennis', 'effectively', 'Gwen', 'cautious', 'subservience', 'outset', 'gradually', 'character', 'funnier', 'turning', 'whining', 'neurotic', 'actors', 'use', 'familiar', 'mannerisms', 'maximally', 'here', 'more', 'importantly', 'are', 'completely', 'credible', 'suburban', 'married', 'couple', 'who', 'have', 'lean', 'other', 'Hiller', 'smartly', 'real', 'locations', 'urban', 'grittiness', 'sense', 'story', 'Quincy', 'Jones', 'jazzy', 'background', 'music', 'here', 'John', 'Hughes', 'partial', 'knock-off', 'equally', 'hilarious', 'Planes', 'Trains', 'Automobiles', '1987', 'more', 'passing', 'resemblance', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'extras', '2003', 'DVD']",The Out-of-Towners VHS

220143,A3FE9H5V9RMTQG,6300216179,"Jeff ""familyman""","[1, 1]","This is a throwback to the classic American screwball comedy, and as such, is a coherent sequence true to that art form. This style of film making was popular back in the 1930s-40s, characterized by fast-paced reparte, or wit and intellectual humor. Themes of this genre centered on farce, escapist and love and marriage situations, often depicting characters in positions of social conflict. Another element of this film is the use of the satire genre. Satire focuses on abuses, defects and imperfections. Although satire is disguised as humor, it is, in effect, social commentary, used for the purpose of criticizing society (and the individual) into bettering itself, often using wit, as a tool for the action.Jack Lemmon's over-the-top artistic prowess and pure genius, coupled with Sandy Dennis' renowned proficiency in her supporting role, are the famed characteristics that make this film classic. Jack Lemmon was an amazing talent, including an accomplished pianist! His skilled timing, innate connection to the human condition and relation to being in the moment are what distinguished him from his accomplished veteran acting colleagues. Mr. Lemmon always ""stole the show,"" while simultaneously raising the bar for performances of his fellow actors, some of the best in Hollywood. One is truly missing the essence of this captivating film and Mr. Lemmon's incredible contributions to cinema, if this film does not hold your attention, in my opinion! There really is no actor capable of Jack Lemmon's believability and validity when he commits to his choices of actions. For me, this is what makes this film worth owning!

220152,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6300216179,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[32, 35]","I met Sandy Dennis backstage at a play once and wanting to say something more than the usual remarks of admiration I told her that my father stayed up one night to watch &quot;The Out-of-Towners,&quot; which was of some import because my father never stayed up to watch anything.  She said her father liked that one too and I got an autograph in which she spelled by first name correctly.This 1970 film, the original version of &quot;The Out-of-Towners&quot; for those who say the recent version that is part of Steve Martin's attempt to be in more remakes than any other living actor, is my favorite Neil Simon script, which is rather ironic when you consider that he is primarily a comic playwright.  However this script takes the hapless couple of George (Jack Lemmon) and Gwen Kellerman (Dennis) from their home in Ohio to New York City, where he has a job interview.  However, their plans for a nice dinner at the Four Seasons are dashed when the plan circles the airport for hours before being diverted to Boston.  Instead of eating at one of the best restaurants in the world they end up with her eating peanut butter on white bread and him eating crackers and olives with no drinks.  This actually ends up being the best thing that happens to George and Gwen the rest of that night, which involves a train ride to New York, no room at the inn, a garbage strike, a mugger, and being kidnapped while in the back of a police car.  This is without even mentioning the lost eyelash, the broken heel, and the chipped tooth that resulted from a bad encounter with the prize in a box of Cracker Jacks.Throughout it all, George and Gwen keep up a running dialogue as he gets angrier and take more names while she tries to be the voice of reason and attests that she can verify everything her husband says in his growing list of complaints against the city is true.  Everybody always talks about Lemmon's comic partnership with Walter Matthau, but Dennis comes across as the more perfect foil.  Eventually her pessimism is turned into paranoia as the city takes the out of town couple for everything they have and keeps on grinding them into the rain soaked streets where the garbage is piling up to the sky.  Eventually the idea of being Vice President in a company that has something to do with plastics does not seem like a step up in the world if this is the world in which they have to live.I am surprised that this movie is only 98 minutes long, but I suppose it is because of all those commercials with late night television and the way Simon keeps pouring one misery after another on George and Gwen that makes &quot;The Out-of-Towners&quot; seem a lot longer, but not in a bad way.  The pacing is pretty brisk for a story about two people who have a hard time getting to where they are going, and there are a lot of patented Neil Simon one liners, most of which are true to character and context, although Dennis gets maximum mileage out of repeating the phrase &quot;Oh my, God!&quot; and getting big laughs.Simon won the Writers Guild of America award for Best Comedy Written Directly for the Screen for this script, which was originally going to be one segment of &quot;Plaza Suite,&quot; which came out the next year.  But freeing it from the setting of a hotel room or even a hotel, into the wider expanse of New York City and the surrounding environs was what made this black comedy really work.  Keep your eye out for lots of familiar faces who were relatively unknowns when this film came out: Anne Meara, Graham Jarvis, Ron Carey, Robert Walden, Richard Libertini, Paul Dooley, and Billy Dee Williams.  Final thought: If you want to see a film that takes the exact opposite approach to New York City then that would have to be Woody Allen's &quot;Manhattan,&quot; which would come out at the end of this same decade.",5,George and Gwen go to the big bad city of New York,1073606400,"01 9, 2004",2004,3832,"['met', 'Sandy', 'Dennis', 'backstage', 'play', 'once', 'wanting', 'say', 'something', 'more', 'usual', 'remarks', 'admiration', 'told', 'father', 'stayed', 'up', 'one', 'night', 'watch', 'quot', 'Out-of-Towners', 'quot', 'was', 'import', 'father', 'never', 'stayed', 'up', 'watch', 'anything', 'said', 'father', 'liked', 'one', 'too', 'got', 'autograph', 'spelled', 'first', 'name', 'correctly.This', '1970', 'film', 'original', 'version', 'quot', 'Out-of-Towners', 'quot', 'who', 'say', 'recent', 'version', 'part', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'attempt', 'be', 'more', 'remakes', 'other', 'living', 'actor', 'favorite', 'Neil', 'Simon', 'script', 'rather', 'ironic', 'when', 'consider', 'primarily', 'comic', 'playwright', 'However', 'script', 'hapless', 'couple', 'George', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Gwen', 'Kellerman', 'Dennis', 'home', 'Ohio', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'where', 'job', 'interview', 'However', 'plans', 'nice', 'dinner', 'Four', 'Seasons', 'are', 'dashed', 'when', 'plan', 'airport', 'hours', 'being', 'diverted', 'Boston', 'Instead', 'eating', 'one', 'best', 'restaurants', 'world', 'end', 'up', 'eating', 'peanut', 'butter', 'white', 'bread', 'eating', 'crackers', 'olives', 'drinks', 'actually', 'up', 'being', 'best', 'thing', 'George', 'Gwen', 'rest', 'night', 'train', 'ride', 'New', 'York', 'room', 'inn', 'garbage', 'strike', 'mugger', 'being', 'kidnapped', 'back', 'police', 'car', 'even', 'mentioning', 'lost', 'eyelash', 'broken', 'heel', 'chipped', 'tooth', 'resulted', 'bad', 'encounter', 'prize', 'box', 'Cracker', 'Jacks.Throughout', 'George', 'Gwen', 'keep', 'up', 'running', 'dialogue', 'angrier', 'take', 'more', 'names', 'be', 'voice', 'reason', 'attests', 'can', 'verify', 'everything', 'husband', 'growing', 'list', 'complaints', 'city', 'true', 'Everybody', 'always', 'talks', 'Lemmon', 'comic', 'partnership', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'Dennis', 'more', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Eventually', 'pessimism', 'turned', 'paranoia', 'city', 'out', 'town', 'couple', 'everything', 'have', 'keeps', 'grinding', 'rain', 'soaked', 'streets', 'where', 'garbage', 'piling', 'up', 'sky', 'Eventually', 'idea', 'being', 'Vice', 'President', 'company', 'something', 'do', 'plastics', 'not', 'seem', 'step', 'up', 'world', 'world', 'have', 'live.I', 'am', 'surprised', 'movie', 'only', '98', 'minutes', 'long', 'suppose', 'commercials', 'late', 'night', 'television', 'way', 'Simon', 'pouring', 'one', 'misery', 'George', 'Gwen', 'quot', 'Out-of-Towners', 'quot', 'seem', 'lot', 'longer', 'not', 'bad', 'way', 'pacing', 'pretty', 'brisk', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'where', 'are', 'going', 'are', 'lot', 'patented', 'Neil', 'Simon', 'one', 'liners', 'most', 'are', 'true', 'character', 'context', 'Dennis', 'maximum', 'mileage', 'repeating', 'phrase', 'quot', 'Oh', 'God', 'quot', 'getting', 'big', 'laughs.Simon', 'won', 'Writers', 'Guild', 'America', 'award', 'Best', 'Comedy', 'Written', 'Directly', 'Screen', 'script', 'was', 'originally', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'segment', 'quot', 'Plaza', 'Suite', 'quot', 'came', 'next', 'year', 'freeing', 'setting', 'hotel', 'room', 'even', 'hotel', 'wider', 'expanse', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'surrounding', 'environs', 'was', 'what', 'made', 'black', 'comedy', 'really', 'work', 'Keep', 'eye', 'out', 'lots', 'familiar', 'who', 'were', 'relatively', 'unknowns', 'when', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'Anne', 'Meara', 'Graham', 'Jarvis', 'Ron', 'Carey', 'Robert', 'Walden', 'Richard', 'Libertini', 'Paul', 'Dooley', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'Final', 'thought', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'exact', 'opposite', 'approach', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'then', 'that', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'quot', 'Manhattan', 'quot', 'would', 'come', 'out', 'end', 'same', 'decade']",The Out-of-Towners VHS

220158,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,6300216179,MadMacs,"[3, 3]","Long a favorite, but clearly a divisive film.I've witnessed reactions swing from laughter to frowning serious statements of ""please-change-the-channel"". So obviously this isn't for everyone.Interestingly, this reminds me of another polarizing movie that I recently reviewed - 'Bridesmaids'. And like that moronic ridiculously overhyped disaster, you tend to see a clear divide through the audience. Rarely do you get the 'Eh' shrug. No dithering or sitting on the fence - it's either love or hate. (hated Bridesmaids)For myself - love this flick.I completely understand the hate though, because this production, even though dated, speaks to the unending frustration you face in real life. There's no point where you feel like it's something long gone, a past we don't see any more like horse-driven carriages. In fact, given the downward slide of every known educational standard combined with an ever increasing arrogant general populace - sadly, this movie is as relevant today as when it was released.Idiocracytriumphant.Tells the story of a midwest couple, George and Gwen Kellerman. They're making their first trip to the big city.George has one final perfunctory interview before given the job of regional vice-president of his plastics company. This is everything he's worked for - and he can't wait. More money, more opportunity, the life he's always wanted; though Gwen is less than enthused. A small town girl, she's comfortable with what they've built in quiet Columbus, Ohio. Uprooting their lives and their children's lives is not the ideal choice. Still, she supports her husband's dream. So after a quick flight to New York, a planned fabulous dinner at the Four Seasons, the next day's quickie interview, they're off for a few days scouting NYC's schools and upper middle-class homes.Seems pretty straight forward. But from the get-go everything starts to go haywire. Simple glitches that begin as minor irks and inconveniences, particularly given George's riotous and unyielding sense of 'the right way', quickly snowball into a spectacular disaster of epic proportions as every possible thing that can go wrong - does. Murphy's Law cubed.What follows is twelve hours in Hell. A tortuous journey with multiple twisting pitchforks to the spirit. Can George and Gwen survive the big city - will they even live long enough to make it back home?Again, this film quickly defines who you are as a person. Not so much that it would break apart a couple, but enough to reveal the type of personality you have, and the sheer amount of insanity and indignity you can or are willing to withstand. &lt;g>Movie Note: I saw an interview with Neil Simon where he described a vacation he and his first wife took to the Bahamas and their return trip to New York - which formed the basis for the screenplay. Completely hilarious, as several of the scenes in the film are directly replicated from his account. In particular: Avoiding the unappetizing airline meal in favor of a reservation made to a favorite restaurant, only to have their flight diverted to Boston and the mad rush for the late night trains with only leftover clam juice and green olives to eat.

220170,A2OY590A56XV5H,6300216179,Mr. Christopher L. Cox,"[2, 11]","Having successfully avoided the apparent train wreck of a remake of this starring Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn, I thought I'd rent the original Neil Simon film starring Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis to see what caused such a fuss as to remake it after such a short period of time.Jack and Sandy are on their way to New York city from the suburbs, to see about Jack taking a big job there. Suffice it to say, everything that can go wrong does go wrong, and the two are trapped in hell, trying to survive the night before his interview in the morning.This is considered to be classic dark comedy, that will be annoying to some and funny as heck to others. I think I fell in between the two. Jack Lemmon is such an ass, and his wife such a dunderhead, that it's hard to have much sympathy for either one. As their problems pile up, it's all too obvious that the cause is mainly his own agonizing egotism, being thrown as the small fish into the huge pond.

220174,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6300216179,Reviewer,"[3, 4]","Getting ahead in your career or moving on with your life doesn't necessarily mean moving ""up.""  That promotion or ""golden opportunity"" that comes along may not in reality turn out to be all that it would seem, initially, especially if it involves an unprecedented upheaval in your life, like a transfer to another city.  It's a situation that becomes grist for Neil Simon's humor mill in the comedy-of-errors ""The Out-of-Towners,"" directed by Arthur Hiller.  Jack Lemmon stars as George Kellerman, a Midwesterner who finally gets that ""big chance"" when his company offers him a job in New York City.  It sounds good, and just like that, George and his wife, Gwen (Sandy Dennis), are on a plane headed for the Big Apple to look into this opportunity of a lifetime.When their plane lands in New York, however, it's as if the wheels touching the runway triggers something in the cosmos alerting Murphy (whoever he is), who instantly puts his ""Law"" into effect.  And, as Dinah Washington once said in a song, ""Now it begins--""  In this case, one cliche after another, all falling into place like dominoes during a tournament in the park.  Missing luggage; a problem with their hotel accommodations-- as in, they have no reservation; being taken advantage of by a stranger, a native New Yorker looking for an easy mark; getting mugged; a broken tooth.  Think of anything that could possibly go wrong, and it's in here.  And you know what?  it's funny stuff.Under Hiller's steady, if not too imaginative direction, cliche-ridden as it may be, this comedy works, and the reason can be summed up in two words:  Jack Lemmon.  The whole concept of the story is tried and true, but tired; and this is definitely not one of Simon's best efforts (good as it is).  But Lemmon immerses himself in his character, takes the laughing ball and runs with it, and makes even the most weathered and worn situations seem fresh and new.  And, most importantly, he's going to make you laugh, which in the end is what this movie is all about in the first place.What makes Lemmon so successful is that chameleon-like quality of his that enables him to become whatever character it is that he's creating.  His creations may share that frustrated stammer and that tendency toward animated behavior that is so ""Lemmon,"" but beyond and beneath that, he has the ability to bring a definite sensibility to his characters that makes each of them unique.  Here, you believe that George is a lifelong Midwesterner, and it shows in his entire countenance:  His manner, attitude, body language and approach to everything he encounters in the Big City.  George, however, is not your typical wide-eyed, naive and overwhelmed country-bumpkin-come-to-the-city.  Instead, Lemmon creates a very real sense of an average guy facing a new experience in his life-- one that just happens to go completely awry.  And by developing a character grounded in reality, he makes the humor work; it gives the audience someone to whom they can relate.  It's something that Lemmon does so well, and he makes it look so easy while he's doing it.As Gwen, Sandy Dennis is pointedly droll, so low-keyed in the face of their predicaments, in fact, that it would not have been out of character had George checked for her pulse occasionally.  Her performance is fairly ""theatrical,"" more conducive to the stage than film, but in contrast to Lemmon's antics, it somehow becomes quite viable, and actually turns out to be one of the memorable aspects of the film.  When you think about George later, you're going to have to think about Gwen, too.  Gwen serves as something of a sounding board for George, a mirror in which his frustrations are reflected and enhanced.  Ultimately, her non-expressiveness itself becomes an expression of her character, and though Gwen comes across as more caricature than character, within the context of the material, it works.  And, as Lemmon's counterpoint, she plays it very well, and pulls it off without a hitch.In addition to Lemmon's presence, one of the things that makes this film so funny is the accessibility of the characters; it is so easy to project yourself into their situation, and sharing their misadventures through the magic of film makes it hilarious.  And you can empathize with George and Gwen, because down deep you realize that actually having to live through such an ordeal would be anything BUT funny.  It IS fun, however, to experience it from the comfort of your own living room.The supporting cast includes Sandy Baron (Lenny Moyers), Anne Meara (Woman In Police Station), Robert Nichols (Passenger), Ann Prentiss (Stewardess), Ron Carey (Cab Driver), Philip Bruns (Officer Meyers), Graham Jarvis (Murray), Carlos Montalban (Manuel), Billy Dee Williams (Clifford), Richard Libertini (Railway Porter) and Paul Dooley (Day Porter).  After seeing this movie, who would ever be able to forget George, finally at the end of his rope, standing in the middle of the street, refusing to give up and railing at the city itself, challenging it to take it's best shot at him.  And that's just one of the many moments that makes ""The Out-of-Towners"" such a delight, no matter how many times you watch it.  At times, the humor is a bit acerbic; but in the final analysis, this is a film that's going to connect with just about any audience.  It's the magic of the movies; but more than that, it's the magic of a terrific actor named Jack Lemmon.",4,Meet George and Gwen Kellerman,1011571200,"01 21, 2002",2002,5428,"['Getting', 'ahead',

I saw it first as a movie of the week when I was in high school or there abouts and I saw it as just plain funny and interesting.  Gave me lots of insights into humans and their odd ways but thats all until I had my own first adventure on my own in a big city.I recently had to visit New York City on my own for business after living a very sheltered life.  OyVey the things the Out Of Towners prepared me for.  That movie just means so much to me now that I have personally experienced the full weight of  feelings as the characters in the movie.  Of course I did not have the comedic bad luck at every turn they did thank you but, I sure had my moments.  I guess I am saying once you have traveled this movie is even funnier as life in a new world not your own is a strange experience.The movie is a light hearted fast paced rollercoaster ride of events that occur to a happless but far from helpless midwest couple visiting New York City.  The city never turns a cold shoulder to them but never exactly warms up to them either.  With relative good cheer and true midwest grit the intrepid couple deal with thugs, exploding man hole covers, rude hotel staff and one misunderstanding after another in a way both real and funny.  The husband is just confused you know the way Lemmon plays it.  The wife is just whiney enough to be real but never nerve wracking.  There is lots of physical humor and running jokes throuhout the picture.  The picture is not high art and does not pretend to be.  This is a movie you watch just to laugh at the madcap humor that life sometimes can just spew out to hit the a first time traveler.I loved it so much I brought it and do not regret my selection one bit.

The movie starts off fairly slow and uneventful as George and Gwen Kellerman, from Twin Oaks, Ohio, are flying to New York where George has an interview (just mere formality) for a vice presidency. They are expecting to eat dinner at 8:30pm at the Four Seasons, but they never see the inside of that famous eating establishment. Instead, the plane circles for hours and ends up going to Boston because of fog. Once in Boston their luggage is lost, they miss the train to New York, and catch the train to New York. Once in the Big Apple, they find that the city is in the middle of transit and garbage collectors strikes. In the pouring rain they walk to their hotel only to find that their room wasn't held and has been given away. Later the couple are mugged, kidnapped, and George is mugged in his sleep. Having not eaten for several hours and with no money they chase a stray dog for a breakfast of a half-eaten box of Cracker Jacks. More chases follow and they are even kicked out of praying in a church because of a televised special. George eventually does make his morning meeting, but by then has learned some very important lessons about family and the simple life back home in Twin Oaks, Ohio.Jack Lemmon is great in this movie, but I find it's Sandy Dennis who really steals the film. She plays Gwen perfectly, brilliantly foiling Lemmon's performance as the loud and boistorous George. The &quot;O, my God&quot; line, which signals a major worry by Gwen, keeps me laughing every time I hear it.THE-OUT-OF-TOWNERS is a very witty comedy and one of Neil Simon's finest pieces of writing.

Modern comedies that seem to be spewed out on an assembly line (many of which are bad remakes, INCLUDING this movie which is nowhere NEAR as funny!) rely too much on unseemly gimmicks like nudity, foul language, special effects and horrifically distracting camera angle changes every two seconds in order to keep people watching, but The Out of Towners (rated G!) shows them all how it is done in a tasteful and howlingly funny manner! I recently told my friend about this movie as he had never seen it. I brought over my VHS copy a few days later and he laughed right along with me and now has a new movie to add to his list of favorites! This comedy is truly a hidden treasure of laughs. It's not a widely-known film, but everyone I've introduced it to has loved it!Jack Lemmon has me laughing throughout this entire film! He was a master of comedic talents, from his facial expressions to his eccentric outbursts, and is very realistic as a harried, at-the-end-of-his-rope traveler, and is incredibly funny! I think most people can see a lot of themselves and others in George Kellerman. Sandy Dennis also does a great job as his patient, doting wife Gwen, however she too gets fed up at one point and lashes out in her own unique way.This hilarious film has us laughing at almost all of life's mishaps, from the mildly annoying to the outrageously frustrating. Late-arriving planes, lost luggage, missed trains, getting caught in a rainstorm in downtown NY, broken heels, chipped teeth, and on and on and on. Every couple of minutes is another mishap! It never ends for these poor travelers and it's so exhaustingly funny that the ending is almost anti-climactic, although VERY fitting!I give it 5 stars.
