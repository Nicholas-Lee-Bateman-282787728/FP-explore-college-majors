I got it because it was so cheap and I love buying DVDs. It's been over 4 years so I don't think there's any hope. You never know though.If people buy more we may have a change.

817424,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B0001Z3I1C,andy8047,"[2, 4]","Tony Danza enjoyed extended success with his ABC sitcom Taxi(later owned by NBC) from 1978 to 1983 as Tony Banta,one of the Sunshine Cab Co. drivers. It would only be a year after the demise of Taxi that he would be chosen to play Tony Micelli on the ABC sitcom,Who's The Boss?. Tony is a widowed father who moves with his young daughter Samantha(Alyssa Milano) to Connecticut from New York. He becomes the housekeeper for Angela Bower(Judith Light,late of the ABC daytime serial One Life To Live),an advertising executive who is a single parent as well,and her young son Jonathan(Danny Pintauro). Katherine Helmond,another ABC veteran who is late of Soap,is Mona,Angela's mother. The two families would blend into one without marriage(later in the series Tony proposed marriage to Angela but the wedding never happened). ABC aired this sitcom on Thursday nights from September 1984 to September 1992,just like NBC's The Cosby Show. ABC aired WTB for the very last time on September 10,1992 and NBC aired TCS for the very last time one week later. Both WTB and TCS premiered on September 20,1984. What an awesome coincidence,don't you think? WTB recently premiered on cable television's Nick At Nite. Here's an interesting fact:Danza's Taxi co-star Marilu Henner guest starred in one episode of WTB during the show's run. Milano would later become a teen idol,join the cast of Fox's Melrose Place and WB's Charmed. WTB killed CBS's ALICE,THE JEFFERSONS and THE DUKES OF HAZZARD.",5,Tony's the boss!,1104883200,"01 5, 2005",2005,1478,"['Tony', 'Danza', 'enjoyed', 'extended', 'success', 'ABC', 'sitcom', 'Taxi', 'later', 'owned', 'NBC', '1978', '1983', 'Tony', 'Banta', 'one', 'Sunshine', 'Cab', 'Co.', 'drivers', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'year', 'demise', 'Taxi', 'would', 'be', 'chosen', 'play', 'Tony', 'Micelli', 'ABC', 'sitcom', 'Who', 'Boss', 'Tony', 'widowed', 'father', 'who', 'young', 'daughter', 'Samantha', 'Alyssa', 'Milano', 'Connecticut', 'New', 'York', 'housekeeper', 'Angela', 'Bower', 'Judith', 'Light', 'late', 'ABC', 'serial', 'One', 'Life', 'Live', 'advertising', 'executive', 'who', 'single', 'parent', 'as', 'well', 'young', 'son', 'Jonathan', 'Danny', 'Pintauro', 'Katherine', 'Helmond', 'ABC', 'veteran', 'who', 'late', 'Soap', 'Mona', 'Angela', 'mother', 'two', 'families', 'would', 'blend', 'one', 'marriage', 'later', 'series', 'Tony', 'proposed', 'marriage', 'Angela', 'wedding', 'never', 'happened', 'ABC', 'aired', 'sitcom', 'Thursday', 'nights', 'September', '1984', 'September', '1992', 'just', 'NBC', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'ABC', 'aired', 'WTB', 'very', 'last', 'time', 'September', '10,1992', 'NBC', 'aired', 'TCS', 'very', 'last', 'time', 'one', 'week', 'later', 'WTB', 'TCS', 'premiered', 'September', '20,1984', 'What', 'awesome', 'coincidence', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'WTB', 'recently', 'premiered', 'cable', 'television', 'Nick', 'Nite', 'Here', 'interesting', 'fact', 'Danza', 'Taxi', 'co-star', 'Marilu', 'Henner', 'guest', 'starred', 'one', 'episode', 'WTB', 'show', 'run', 'Milano', 'would', 'later', 'become', 'teen', 'idol', 'join', 'cast', 'Fox', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'WB', 'Charmed', 'WTB', 'killed', 'CBS', 'ALICE', 'THE', 'JEFFERSONS', 'THE', 'DUKES', 'OF', 'HAZZARD']",Who's the Boss? - The Complete First Season

817432,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B0001Z3I1C,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[1, 1]","I liked Tony Danza in ""TAXI,"" but he did seem a little underused. Even if you see the whole series, he doesn't really have a lot of episdoes that revolve around him. This was a nice show in that Tony has more freedom to act.What makes this show interesting is that it is full of contradictions. We have a woman exectutive (Angela) who leaves her house and son in the trust of Tony. And while Tony supposedly just works there, it is really he who runs the house. We have Angela's son who is very proper and neat and we have Tony's daughter Samantha who is rather tomboyish. And to top it off, we have Angela's mother who is on the older side, but she acts convincingly like a teenage girl.I think the biggest mistake on this dvd box is that they call this a dysfunctional family. I don't see how they can call it that. If anything, this family works through everything, helps each other, and operates very smoothly depsite the faults of the characters.Most of the episodes are very good. My only real complaint, and why I am deducting one star is the horrible 2 part episdoe with Angela's x husband. He is a rotton, cruel, totally unlikable monster, and we spend an hour wishing Tony would simply pick him up and throw him out the door. (Something like what he does in ""Protecting the President."")But that said, we get to see how they work through awkward moments like when Tony accidentally 'sees' Angela; even in the early 3rd episode, we see that there is more than a employer/employee relationship between Tony and Angela; we see how they handle true hurt and sadness when Angela's so called friend makes fun of Angela and walks out on Tony after 'using him;' we get to see how Angela tries to teach Samantha not to fight, but then Samantha catches Angela fighting; we get to see Tony and Angela faced with a moral choice vs money; we get to see Angela help Tony stop trying to hide his pain over his father's death; we see Tony help calm problems between Angela and Mona when Mona has to move in for a short while; we see poor Tony and Angela photographed in an awkward moment; we see Tony have to teach John not to imitate all the bad things he did as a child; we see Samantha struggle with having to be in a class where almost everyone is financially above her; and in the final episdoe, we see some tenderness between Tony and Angela. (Sounds like a very functional family to me.)I'll finish with a real signature line from Tony. Mona had to move in for a short while at one point. Angela and Mona simultaneously say: ""It's only temporary."" And Tony comes out with: ""Hey! What is this temporary stuff? You're family! You need a place to stay, you stay as long as you want!""I know many people are wanting more seasons. (Myself included.)

It's visible that the relationship between all the characters is genuine and caring. Tony is always upbeat and true. Mona is a card with an upbeat sense of humor who underneath it all is very caring of her daughter, Angela. Angela is more straight-laced, although funny at times too, however you need that to balance the whole mix of characters. And the kids are cute with their own innocent comedy.

It means my kid can laugh and watch the cheery sitcoms of the 80s and skip the drugs/sex/idiocy/scarcasm of 2007 that's supposed to be a dipiction of 'real life'.You would think by now... I'd be sick of ""Angela's First Fight"" or ""Sorority Sisters"" after over 50x, but, no -- that's got to be the sign of an awesome sitcom. My kids are nuts over Season One of Who's the Boss - I'm going to have to just tape the rest of it off tv. Doesn't look like this winner is every coming out. I've been waiting almost 5 years now. I really have to say, tho, I am surprised what a great sitcom it is.

It's corny, hokey, very 80s, and everything I miss about TV sitcoms to this day.  Tony Micelli is my idea of a real man--ALL man, sports loving and rough around the edges, yet a downhome romantic who isn't afraid to take on nontraditional roles like being the housemaid to a single mother.  It's yuppie meets the Rockie of the baseball world to some extent, which leaves the show plenty of open doors for good comic plots.Alyssa Milano is cute and funny as Tonys semi-sassy daughter Sam, but Danny Pintauro as Angela Bower's son Johnathan is just a bit stiff and annoying at times.  I love the difference between Judith Light's proper Angela and her mother, the wild swinger Mona played with great natural humor by the always likeable Catherine Helmond.  Without her presence, the show wouldn't work quite as well.  The chemistry between Tony and Angela is also as appealing as that of Fran and Max on The Nanny, so you may notice many similarities in the two shows, except the writing of the Nanny is sharper.My favorite episode?  By far, Angela's First Fight.  I laughed so hard, never having seen it before, that I watched it over a few times.
