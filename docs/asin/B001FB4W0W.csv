The death scences of a Vampires are gross when they turn into a mess of blood.  The characters are hard to believe and act like idots most of the time. The love Sookie Stackhouse is supposed to feel for Bill the Vampire is lacking,you don't feel the magic between them.  Their facial expressions don't even show a deeping love.  The secondary characters are a drag on the show i.e., sheriff etc, very poor activng or directing, whichever. Emotion is entirely missing in the acting for the entire cast.  It is definitely not one that I would considering purchasing or rewatching beyond the HBO initial series. Give it One * Star.

Plot lines that are simply stupid (Amy? who the ... is Amy?  who needs Jason in such amounts? Who needs Tara in same amounts and - especially - her alco mom? Lafayette is not bad but again - too much of a good thing in not always wonderful, whatever May West used to say)Books - a heroine one would love to be friends with, tough but gentle and able to laugh at herselfTV series - a hysterical and most of the time dumb blonde.Books - some of the most gorgeous - and different - vampires. Vampires with personalitiesTV series - mostly trashy looking ones (Bill - Moyer actually is an exception and is a very good fit, but same could not be said about the others. For example, Eric described as being gorgeous - here he looks like somebody who just raised from behind a dumpster where he has been sleeping for the last couple of years)Books - a nicely balanced mix of romance, sex and danger which shows the author\s good tasteTV series - a great number of nude bodies and totally unnecessary sex scenes (Harris usually limits it to about one or two steamy scenes per book which makes for a pleasant reading without rolling one's eyes too much but the TV version seems to have been done by a hormone crazy teen and not especially intelligent one)I can go on and on. Mostly I am sorry about the humor that evaporated completely. And I am sorry if some viewers would in the future judge the books by that TV trash.Folk tales say you need a pointed stake to kill a vampire - looks like smth really dull works as well...

Really when I heard this was a vampire series I was skeptical because of twilight but this series gave me a whole new perspective because of its content. In other words if you are worried about not liking this series because of Twilight it is completely different. It is an adult version of Twilight. Lots of sex, violence, action and other things what else can you ask for. I have to say one thing about this TV show is that it leaves you on the edge of your seat.  That is all you can ask for a TV series is it making you want to  come back next week for more. Another advantage of this series is it is really hard to read. When you see the end of the season or the last episode it will really surprise you how everything turns out. Also the way the characters are layed out in this season are perfect. It seems like anyone could identify with one of the characters in this series. You could find one you love and one that you hate. That is key for any movie or TV series if you are able to identify with one or more of the characters you know you got something going for you. Let me say this, there are so many twists and turns in this season alone that it is not predictable and that is a good thing. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and you don't have to worry this is nothing from twilight from what I hear. It is more mature and something that everyone can enjoy if they give it a chance.

Another fantastic drama filled with complex characters, nail-biting storylines, and rollercoaster relationships and romances.  I eagerly anticipate the start of each new season, dread the end of each one, and stay up to date on show developments when it's not on the air.The first season is an absolute necessity for anyone interested in watching this show.  Because of the complexity of the show and the development of plots and characters, True Blood really isn't a show that can be successfully picked up in the middle.  Characters disappear for a season only to reappear in a later season and old stories resurface once you think they've concluded.Personally, I'm not into the new vampire fad.  I barely made it through the first Twilight movie without gagging, and the other vampire shows and books really don't pique my interest.  True Blood grabs me because it is so different from the typical vampire story.To begin with, the vampires in True Blood are not in hiding.  The world knows all about them since their ""Great Revelation"" which was sparked by the invention of synthetic blood that vampires can live on instead of relying on human blood to survive.  In fact, there is a vampire rights movement to give vampires equal footing with humans in modern society.  Of course, there is mixed sentiment among humans about vampires.  Some people are open to their assimilation into society and others are completely opposed to their existence.  But just as many humans dislike vampires, many vampires dislike humans and think that they are inferior beings.Then, of course, there are human/vampire relationships which two protagonists explore.  THAT is very interesting.  Oh, and the human is also telepathic and can hear everyone's thoughts... except her vampire boyfriend.Also, we have a new substance entering the illegal drug trade: vampire blood.  It's got some pretty desirable side effects and is touted to be the best thing out there.  Imagine the conflicts that arise out of that -- how do you think someone gets that, and how much do you think you're gonna have to pay for it?Oh, and in the first season, there's a murderer running around killing fang-bangers (people who sleep with vampires).  You know, just to make things even more exciting.And all of the characters have their own little issues and secrets that are explored.  Don't forget... this is just the first season!  It gets better as you go.A common complaint that I've heard is from people who read the books before watching the show; the show is VERY different from the books and strays from the book A LOT.

Well I did like it but I like most anything with vampires in it, but all in all the show seamed to me to try to hard to be shocking and cool (and doing this by having characters have sex all the time) not that I mind sex or even graphic sex in a TV show or movie but when there is several long sex scenes in about every episode I start wondering why I did not just pick up a porn movie in the first place. However a little bit into the season the show do get better, the storyline and the characters pick up.The show have some very good and interesting characters, and some who are not so much. The premise of the show is that a few years into the future vampires have stepped forward and declared their presence. They have now become a part of society, partly due to the fact that they drink tru blood, artificial blood. Society is in an uproar over the vampires, some welcoming them and some wanting them hunted down and killed. In some way the show is similar to Alienation in that you have these supernatural creatures which try to become a part of society but there is forces working against that both in human society and inside the supernatural society. Now as often happens in these vampire shows one of the undead fall in love with a human girl. In this case a psychic blond redneck named Sookie. The show is about these two and their relationship as well as the pepole around them and their reactions to vampires suddenly being a part of society.I found True Blood to be an enjoyable show. I however do think that it at times is to redneck and try to hard to be trashy. At times I would love to see a character who do not live in a trailer or a house so run down it is surprising it do not fall a part and who actually have a bit off class. But I do not know, perhaps it is just me being snobby.

1188933,A2I4VTPKGSQZ75,B001FB4W0W,Anthony Hand,"[5, 6]","Contains spoilersFrom what I've heard from fans, the Sookie Stackhouse stories have not traveled well to the screen. Having not read any of Charlaine Harris' novels myself, I can't say. But, given what the first season of 'True Blood' has to offer, I am loath to doubt the veracity of such comments.In short, what we have here is a bog standard ""which man will the girl choose"" type of story, intermingled with some OTT Hollywood Sex(tm) and some superfluous vampires and other assorted mythical creatures, all set in some Southern backwater (complete with truly terrible accents). The basic premise of the vampire as ""minority"" coming ""out of the coffin"" is a pretty good one, but it not is elaborated on enough here. There was so much more that could have been done with that idea. But it gets somewhat abandoned, in favor of yet another shot of naked flesh or another sex scene. All of which becomes really tiresome after a while. Don't get me wrong, sex has its place in movies and TV. But, like gore, when it's done just for the sake of it (as it is here) it can become boring and obvious (as it is here). In addition, the obsession with sex and the vampire has lost its umph years ago. Vampires are dead, they can't have sex. It's unbelievably juvenile and renders the vampires ""impotent"" in their fear factor. Put it like this, I doubt anyone would want to get it on with one of the vampires in '30 Days of Night', which is a far superior take on the subject. In that movie, they are scary and something you really don't want to be around. In 'True Blood', they have no scare at all.Also, there's way too much time wasted on characters that really should be incidental, like Jason (sookie's dim witted brother), who is a truly wretched character. I know he's been turned into the prime suspect of a murder case, but the lack of evidence in that is laughable and certainly doesn't warrant the amount of time he's present onscreen. Likewise, for Tara. The standard issue ""angry black person"". What a tired clich&eacute;. although, at least her character has some progress throughout the series. Her alcoholic mother, too, is another un-necessary road trip that I could have done without.Lafayette, on the other hand, works very well. But, I am given to understand that in the books, he is nothing like the character portrayed in the series.The heart of the show...the vampires...are, unfortunately, such a miserable lot. They are the modern day ""feeling sorry for themselves"" neo-goth versions. In other words, extremely irritating. But there are some good moments with them. When people aren't trying to screw them, they are allowed to have their shot onscreen and it can be done well, as in the tribunal held for vampire Bill (ha ha, still laugh at that) at the end of the series. Or, when the scene shifts to ""Fangtasia"", the bar where the vampires hang out. In ""Fangtasia"", we meet Eric, who is a sheriff of sorts for the region and is destined to have some altercation with Bill, after the interesting scene where the vampires use Sookie's telepathy for their own ends. Regrettably, the vampires have few opportunities to be menacing, which ultimately makes their inclusion in the story somewhat pointless.It's not all bad though. I have to say that I was actually interested in where the story went, even if it was nothing more than a love story wrapped up in unusual clothes. There are enough hooks to keep the viewer coming back and enough ""interest"" to justify that extra hour's watching, when you really should be going to bed! However, I doubt I will be watching Season 2.

1188934,A3QC4SG7NA4ULG,B001FB4W0W,A reader,"[26, 54]","Imagine yourself down on your knees, licking the floor of a men's bathroom at a gas station two miles off the interstate at 3 a.m. on a Sunday morning. That would be a gourmet meal compared to what I had to stomach to sit through the first two episodes of ""True Blood.""  Even to last that long took a fair amount of willpower, but I forced myself to keep watching because part of me couldn't believe a really popular t.v. show could be that vile.Maybe I'm just old-fashioned, or lack an edgy sense of humor. But personally I think it means that there's a limit as to how much gratuitous brutality I'm able to tolerate in the name of being entertained.  And that includes the ugly, cheap sex that permeates this series, and which appears to be the underlying reason for all the vampire brouhaha surrounding the sex scenes.The basic premise of the show is clever: a world where an oppressed vampire minority has ""come out of the closet,"" because the invention of artificial blood has eliminated the need for them to hunt humans.  Still, vampires have to deal with their fundamental difference from humans, as well as eons of societal prejudice against them.  Then there's a young human woman whose ability to read minds and other traits make her sympathetic to the vampire cause.  Add a large dose of the sexual attraction that is always part of vampire lore.  This could make for interesting drama in the hands of an imaginative writer.  It's not vampires I find objectionable.  It's ""True Blood"" I find objectionable.Some reviewers have noted that the series is based on books that are better than the show, which is usually the case when books are adapted for the screen. Be that as it may, I saw only offensive stereotypes of Southerners; relentless gore; sex that was more pornographic than erotic; viciousness; and an ongoing series of visual images that left me feeling like I wished I'd been wearing a Haz Mat suit.Consider this review a public service for any other old-fashioned, out-of-touch people who, like me, hadn't paid attention to the show and were curious about it.

The characters are often insanely dumb, to the point where you slap your forehead and think ""You idiot!"". The thing is, it's realistic. People do act this way. People do stupid stuff all the time. They lie, they do drugs despite knowing it's dumb, they hook up with the wrong person and go along with someone else's lead and get into trouble and yes, it's moronic, but it happens every single day. This time it;s just happening on TV with hot people and vampires. These folks aren't acting out some Dracula wannabe plot - it's every possible bad choice and malicious intent and poor desperate act you've ever heard of, on screen, with good skin and a perky figure. It's a beautiful disaster.By the time I'd finished the series, I'd come to the realization that the writers are pure genius. It takes some serious skills to present this level of idiocy accurately and in a fashion that people will want to watch. It's a perfect black comedy, helped by that fact that most of the actors are playing it like it's a drama, and the vampire characters are playing it like it's a horror. It's not doing anything to help combat the stereotype that ""southerners are morons"", but it's certainly entertaining.Yes, I'll watch the second season.

Did I get an eye full...LITERALLY!!  The story of Jason sets off into a porn story and every episode has at least one scene of his debauchery.  I was disgusted.  I spent more time fast-forwarding the series than watching it.Some areas follow the story but it's not filmed in first person as the books are written.  There were so many side stories I would get confused on what was going on (of course I skipped a lot of it too).  This never happened in the books.  The sex scenes were very explicit and should be more of an X rating than an R.  I can't believe that this stuff exists on TV.  Now I'm glad I never wasted the money on HBO.If you like porn, then perhaps you would like this series.  Otherwise, I'd steer clear.  I had ordered the 2nd series at the same time I purchased this one.  As soon as I intermittently watched (fast-forwarding through a lot of it) the first season, I cancelled my order for the second.Don't waste your money.  Read the books again if you love them.

1188942,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B001FB4W0W,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[0, 1]","True Blood is the latest hit show from HBO, and their biggest success since the heyday of The Sopranos. Based on the Sookie Stackhouse Mysteries by Charlaine Harris and developed for television by Alan Ball, creator of Six Feet Under, the show initially appears to be a trashy adult answer to the current craze for vampire books and films: the NC-17 version of Twilight, as it were. However, this is a simplistic analysis of the show, which is actually tackling a number of more interesting ideas and themes underneath its slightly sleazy veneer.The show starts off a little slow, and it has to be said that the dancing around of the will they-won't they relationship between Sookie and Bill is a little tedious after the first couple of episodes. Luckily, the writers clearly aren't interested in keeping that going for the lifetime of the series, so they let the characters get together and see what happens next. This relationship is the core of the show and Anna Paquin and Stephen Moyer (who amusingly first played a vampire in the brilliant Ultraviolet mini-series a decade ago) sell it very well (and they got into a real-life relationship shortly after starting the show as well). Moyer as Bill in particular has some nice moments as he is very much a Southern courtly gentleman from the Civil War era making an effort to go 'mainstream', but he also doesn't have any problems with killing people who have wronged him or tasting human blood as long as he doesn't kill them. This somewhat hypocritical attitude is played well, but he isn't entirely called on it before the end of the season, so it's unclear if it's deliberate or not. Paquin has a much harder role to play, and there are moments where the actress seems to struggle with what's going on in her character's head, but at other times she does an excellent job.Amongst the other cast members, Chris Bauer (Frank Sobotka from The Wire) and William Sanderson (the toymaker from Blade Runner) are superb as the town's ineffectual policemen. Ryan Kwanten has a really tough role as Sookie's quite spectacularly stupid brother, who dodges disaster by the skin of his teeth only to get into an even more spectacular mess later on. He just about manages to retain the viewer's sympathy even as the character's life becomes yet another car crash, which is a tribute to the actor. Rutina Wesley plays Sookie's best friend Tara and is rather tiresome to start off with, coming across a bit too much as a hard-assed, don't-need-no-man, all-attitude character but she rapidly becomes one of the show's strongest assets. The scenes where Tara has to confront her mother's alcoholism are superbly well-acted by both parties. Alexander Skarsgard steals every scene he is in as Louisiana's vampire 'sherrif', Eric, especially when paired with Kristin Bauer as his second-in-command, Pam. Lizzy Caplan also needs a nod as psychopathic hippy Amy, who has to combine two very different sides of her character to make a convincing whole and pulls it off. Nelsan Ellis is also excellent as Tara's highly dubious but charismatic cousin Lafayette (who impressively combines the roles of cook, road-digger, drug-dealer and webcam sex actor).In addition to these characters, there's a vast number of secondary, recurring and guest actors and characters, from Heroes' Zeljko Ivanek as a vampire judge to TNG and BSG actress Michelle Forbes as a very curious new character who appears at the end of the season, and pretty much all of them are great in their roles.The question of what True Blood is actually about is a difficult one to answer. On the surface, it's a simple murder mystery with vampires, a lot of sex and some quite spectacular gore (especially towards the end of the season). Of course, it's Alan Ball and it's HBO, so it can't be as simple as that. The show initially seems to be contrasting vampires and their struggle for acceptance with gay and black people, which is an interesting idea, if a bit superficial. However, our brief glimpses into the vampire society reveals that the vampires' bigotry and dislike of humans is far more ingrained in them than dislike of vampires is in human society, so the comparison seems to shift of one of a clash of completely incompatible cultures. If even Bill, the 'poster boy for mainstreaming', still does reprehensible and disturbing things, that suggests that the vampires may simply not be that interested in joining real human society. If that is true, that raises the question of what actually is their goal in coming out into the open? It'll be intriguing to see if this is a genuine plot point or simply a background premise that you have to go with and ignore the inconsistencies in order to enjoy the show.Other issues are also dealt with in a rather puzzling manner, such as Tara's mother's alcoholism. The character blames her alcoholism on a 'demon' living in her soul and, since this is a show about vampires after all, the viewer is unsure whether to dismiss this as an excuse from a woman living in denial of her own failures or if there really is a supernatural element involved. It takes a surprisingly long time for the truth of this plot point to come out into the open, although it's quite clever when it does emerge. Similarly, the odd behaviour of certain characters is highlighted throughout the series, presumably to make us ponder if they could be the serial killer, so that when it is revealed they are not, the 'real' reasons for their odd behaviour don't seem to entirely explain their odd quirks.On the other hand, the show doesn't seem to entirely take itself too seriously. It also seems to be well aware of the minefield of possible ways it has to offend the viewers, with quite a few black, gay and/or religious characters, and seems to get around the issues by lots of what TV Tropes calls lampshade-hanging (i.e. drawing attention to the issue and almost revelling in it rather than ignoring it). The show also takes what appears to be an overtly anti-Twilight agenda by refusing to have Sookie be rescued out of her predicaments by the various men-folk in her life (probably best-handled in the season finale) and turning her into a proactive character rather than a damsel in distress all the time, which is vital if we are to retain any respect and sympathy for the character.True Blood's first season (****) is solid, enjoyable fun with some deeper ideas and themes running through it than it first appears. It's slightly trashy and sleazy (although never quite fulfilling the promise of its borderline-sordid title sequence) and on that level won't appeal to all viewers, but it's consistently well-written and superbly-acted, and is well worth a look.",4,Excellently written and acted,1253664000,"09 23, 2009",2009,6695,"['True', 'Blood', 'latest', 'hit', 'show', 'HBO', 'biggest', 'success', 'heyday',

The Jason and Tara plotlines were especially hard to rewatch and I found myself fast forwarding through them.As for the blu ray, the picture is fine and the sound is fine, neither is too remarkable. I give the set only a 3 because the interface with the enhanced viewing is not very enjoyable. Rather than having the option of viewing each piece of information (as in the Band of Brothers blu ray), the enhanced viewing is either on or off. This is not too annoying with the popup information window, although some of these had glitches. I enjoyed learning about each vampire's history and even the hints, though I had already figured those out. However, when a pip video comes on, the video itself is silenced so that the pip video is heard. There appears no way to get out of the pip.

If ""SIX FEET"" was a prime rib then this is cotton candy.  And yet when you get past the shaky first 3-4 episodes it is absolutely a guilty pleasure.I am not crazy about the casting Paquin as Sookie.  She didn't deserve the roll, let alone the Emmy she got for it.  I don't get HBO's love affair with her.  Her accent is annoying and she is so clearly ""acting"".  To add to the over-wrought awkward performances is her brother, Ryan Kwantan (who was clearly hired because of how he looks with his shirt off and not because of his acting...eeek) and Bill the Vampire who sounds like Elvis when he says ""Aww Sookie""  Most of the supporting players also look like they're trying WAY too hard to appear southern or the clichet version of ""gay"" but end up coming off as plastic pretty people.I love Vampire anything and while this show definitely feeds that monkey, I still wish it could be even be darker with more poetry and less camp.  Ball's use of the Vampire as an allegory for gay-tolerance is both brilliant in its concept and clunky in its execution.  I was very excited to see this show and like many of my friends was disappointed.As I continued to watch each week, I found some things very entertaining in the series, long after my friends had written it off as mere cheese.  Funny how TRUE BLOOD got a second season ONLY 2 episodes into the first season which I believe happened because HBO needed a hit show so badly (and NEEDS Allen Ball) that they were going to give it a second season despite its obvious growing pains.  We'll see if HBO's unconditional love for Ball pays off in season 2.  I ultimately, think that HBO should hold all of its shows to the highest standard like it used to (when it HAD shows:-(As I said, TRUBLOOD is junk food, a guilty pleasure and though mostly fun to watch, it isn't really as aware as it thinks it is.",3,Eventually finds it's own rhythm but not without hitting some wrong notes....,1235520000,"02 25, 2009",2009,2066,"['First', 'off', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'compare', 'Allen', 'Ball', 'groundbreaking', 'first', 'series', 'SIX', 'FEET', 'UNDER', 'acting', 'writing', 'was', 'shoulder-to-shoulder', 'SOPRANOS', 'made', 'HBO', 'what', 'was', 'peak', 'SIX', 'FEET', 'was', 'prime', 'rib', 'then', 'cotton', 'candy', 'yet', 'when', 'get', 'shaky', 'first', '3-4', 'episodes', 'absolutely', 'guilty', 'pleasure.I', 'am', 'not', 'crazy', 'casting', 'Paquin', 'Sookie', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'roll', 'let', 'alone', 'Emmy', 'got', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'HBO', 'love', 'affair', 'accent', 'annoying', 'so', 'clearly', 'acting', 'add', 'over-wrought', 'awkward', 'performances', 'brother', 'Ryan', 'Kwantan', 'who', 'was', 'clearly', 'hired', 'how', 'shirt', 'off', 'not', 'acting', 'eeek', 'Bill', 'Vampire', 'who', 'Elvis', 'when', 'Aww', 'Sookie', 'Most', 'supporting', 'players', 'also', 'look', ""'re"", 'trying', 'WAY', 'too', 'hard', 'appear', 'southern', 'clichet', 'version', 'gay', 'end', 'up', 'coming', 'off', 'plastic', 'pretty', 'people.I', 'love', 'Vampire', 'anything', 'show', 'definitely', 'monkey', 'still', 'wish', 'could', 'be', 'even', 'be', 'darker', 'more', 'poetry', 'less', 'camp', 'Ball', 'use', 'Vampire', 'allegory', 'gay-tolerance', 'brilliant', 'concept', 'clunky', 'execution', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'see', 'show', 'many', 'friends', 'was', 'disappointed.As', 'continued', 'watch', 'week', 'found', 'things', 'very', 'entertaining', 'series', 'long', 'friends', 'had', 'written', 'off', 'mere', 'cheese', 'Funny', 'how', 'TRUE', 'BLOOD', 'got', 'second', 'season', 'ONLY', '2', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'believe', 'happened', 'HBO', 'needed', 'hit', 'show', 'so', 'badly', 'NEEDS', 'Allen', 'Ball', 'were', 'going', 'give', 'second', 'season', 'obvious', 'growing', 'pains', ""'ll"", 'see', 'HBO', 'unconditional', 'love', 'Ball', 'season', '2', 'ultimately', 'think', 'HBO', 'should', 'hold', 'shows', 'highest', 'standard', 'used', 'when', 'HAD', 'shows', 'said', 'TRUBLOOD', 'junk', 'food', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'mostly', 'watch', ""n't"", 'really', 'as', 'aware']",True Blood: Season 1

I'll leave the synopsis-writing to others and tell you my impressions. First of all, before I knew it took place in Louisiana (didn't know that the first couple of shows) I could have told you that the humidity level was as high as my home state of Florida. I wondered (and still do) why everyone isn't getting attacked by swarms of mosquitos - I'm itchy just watching the show where everyone is walking around in shorts and sleeveless shirts. But from the opening music and steamy scenes, this show is hot and makes me the same....Even though there may not be anything sexual going on in the show at a certain moment, the atmosphere is enough (and it's usually at night) to make you loosen your collar and wonder when your honey is coming home. I'm reminded of the movie Body Heat - the scene where he goes up to her house to see the chimes - the misty night air, the slight, hot, humid breeze making the chimes sound....this is the feeling I get from the atmosphere of the show.  With all this, the acting is excellent. You have Sookie who finds herself being accepted for who she is (a clairavoyant) by all things a gorgeous vampire, Bill.  Both of these actors, in real life, are English (I believe) and if you see them in interviews have lovely English accents and yet do a wonderful lazy southern Louisiana drawl.  On a sociological level, I find it very interesting to think that a subculture like vampirism could be on the verge of acceptance by general society. Some humans, of course, want nothing to do with them.  You can form your own parallels in our own society, I know I have. (And now you have a shapeshifter - makes you wonder who we're sharing the planet with).They can't be all bad if they're willing to drink ""true blood"", a synthetic drink they can drink in public and be out to dinner with friends. There's a lot to like about this show and I'll be buying the DVD of the first season as soon as it's out.

These actors, writers, directors, and everyone else involved in this amazing production obviously care very much about keeping it real in this partially supernatural world, and they succeed.I can't say enough about the acting on this show, this is a very talented group of people who bring the books to life, but also add even more dimension to the characters and stories.The books are told from Sookie's point of view, and that handy little gift/curse she has, being able to hear other people's thoughts. The TV show is able to follow other characters stories as well, and it's wonderful the way they have kept the voice of the author, while expanding the stories to include more details about the other characters lives.  It all feels true to the spirit of the books.It's easy to see if you will like this, just watch a few of the clips included above.The stories have sex, action, adventure, self-reflection, desire, bigotry, prejudice, life and death situations, parental issues, fanatics, despair, relationships of all kinds, friendships, and all of this is set in the ever-present ""world"" of the deep south.  It adds a flavor that is has everything from cajun spice to homemade jam.  It keeps you wondering what will happen next, and caring about all of these people.The DVD commentaries are very good, and it's really fun to hear all of the actors speak in their real voices, and various real accents,  as well as appreciate just how good these actors are.

It's essentially a dressed up well done soap opera. Many shows today suffer from this new format that suck (no pun intended) a viewer in and drag us through but leave us with little else for the experience.I can dig out DVDs of M*A*S*H*, Star Trek, Little House on the Prairie, or even Giligan's Island and find a favorite episode or two or 10 to get me re-engaged all over again, almost like with a good film. Still, for all that season 1 of True Blood was it was not something i will feel compelled to put on again.There was also a level of hokeyness that i did not expect. I was told, and was hoping for 6 feet Under or American Beauty with Vampires. I was hoping for tip top acting and writing and a show that was mature and intelligent. All i wound up with was 12 episodes of a soft core vampire soap opera.6 Feet Under stands out as a great HBO drama that has staying power. I have favorite episodes and own and love that series. Baring some unforeseen change in this shows format and writing I doubt this show will grow much. There is a Dukes of Hazzard silliness to this that I was not expecting and was disappointed by.I will say that i did enjoy it enough to see it through to it's end, or finale. Similarly to Heroes and LOST there is an element that is lacking here that great films and great TV have.

1188982,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B001FB4W0W,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[2, 3]","Alan Ball's True Blood series works largely because he is such an excellent writer.  I really should never have doubted that after he pulled off 6 FEET UNDER and AMERICAN BEAUTY, that he could also pull off this.  He adapted the material from Charlain Harris's popular Sookie Stackhouse novels. There is another reason this succeeds though.  Once again an Oscar winning actress, Anna Paquin, known only as a film actress, came aboard as the lead character, Sookie Stackhouse. a  mind reader.  It makes a huge difference when actors who made it in film, agree to do tv, a previously unheard of crossover. Cary Grant back in the '60s, although he loved tv, would never agree to do it, laying down the edict that ""film actors never do tv"". Film actors followed that advice for decades but, in this decade, that old chestnut was finally put to rest for good. Likewise film actors are now giving super models the permanent axe because they now do advertising and, of course, they do it better.  It is win-win for those of us in the viewing public--of any media.This series has an ideal Southern Goth setting in a rural, swampy Louisiana parrish. There is no doubt vampires exist.  They even have legal rights. Thus, no screen time is wasted on disbelief in vampires, which has already been done countless times. An immediate romantic interest is set up with Paquin and a vampire, played by Stephen Moyer, who was made into a vampire at the end of the Civil War. However, her employer, owner of Merlotte's diner, is also interested in her,  played by Sam Trammell. I enjoy Paquin's brother, played by Ryan Kwanten.  He is an airhead and knows it and is a nice contrast to Pacquin's character.One warning: this is a very gory and sexually graphic tv series.  It is done in a rather campy, over the top manner but if you do not like explicit sex, gore and violence, this is NOT for you.HBO rarely misses and once again it has scored with this series.",5,I DID NOT EXPECT TO LIKE THIS--BUT I DID--VERY WELL DONE,1253923200,"09 26, 2009",2009,1942,"['Alan', 'Ball', 'True', 'Blood', 'series', 'largely', 'such', 'excellent', 'writer', 'really', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'doubted', 'pulled', 'off', '6', 'FEET', 'UNDER', 'AMERICAN', 'BEAUTY', 'could', 'also', 'pull', 'off', 'adapted', 'material', 'Charlain', 'Harris', 'popular', 'Sookie', 'Stackhouse', 'novels', 'reason', 'Once', 'again', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'actress', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'known', 'only', 'film', 'actress', 'came', 'aboard', 'lead', 'character', 'Sookie', 'Stackhouse', 'mind', 'reader', 'huge', 'difference', 'when', 'actors', 'who', 'made', 'film', 'agree', 'do', 'tv', 'previously', 'unheard', 'crossover', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'back', ""'60s"", 'loved', 'tv', 'would', 'never', 'agree', 'do', 'laying', 'down', 'edict', 'film', 'actors', 'never', 'do', 'tv', 'Film', 'actors', 'followed', 'advice', 'decades', 'decade', 'old', 'chestnut', 'was', 'finally', 'put', 'rest', 'good', 'Likewise', 'film', 'actors', 'are', 'now', 'giving', 'super', 'models', 'permanent', 'axe', 'now', 'do', 'advertising', 'course', 'do', 'better', 'win-win', 'viewing', 'public', 'media.This', 'series', 'ideal', 'Southern', 'Goth', 'setting', 'rural', 'swampy', 'Louisiana', 'parrish', 'doubt', 'vampires', 'exist', 'even', 'have', 'legal', 'rights', 'Thus', 'screen', 'time', 'wasted', 'disbelief', 'vampires', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'countless', 'times', 'immediate', 'romantic', 'interest', 'set', 'up', 'Paquin', 'vampire', 'played', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', 'who', 'was', 'made', 'vampire', 'end', 'Civil', 'War', 'However', 'employer', 'owner', 'Merlotte', 'diner', 'also', 'interested', 'played', 'Sam', 'Trammell', 'enjoy', 'Paquin', 'brother', 'played', 'Ryan', 'Kwanten', 'airhead', 'nice', 'contrast', 'Pacquin', 'character.One', 'warning', 'very', 'gory', 'sexually', 'graphic', 'tv', 'series', 'done', 'rather', 'campy', 'top', 'manner', 'do', 'not', 'explicit', 'sex', 'gore', 'violence', 'NOT', 'you.HBO', 'rarely', 'once', 'again', 'scored', 'series']",True Blood: Season 1

Nobody does drama like HBO and nobody can bring those dramas to the small screen like Alan Ball. He knows with uncanny ability how to Cast these shows, you can see no one else inhabiting these characters like the ones he has chosen. Alan also gives us visually the most striking of locations and set designs, he brings them from page to screen and breathes into them life eternal.Trueblood is different than your run of the mill girl meets boy, boy is a vampire, girl falls anyway, chaos ensues. The formula is there but its weaved and curled like a Kudzu vine around a unique and original and spectacular storyline that would make Dracula stake himself with envy. Vampires are now ""out"" in society, no longer hiding under the earth. They want to be citizens again and promise to behave themselves and the Japanese have made that possible with the invention of Trueblood, the synthetic blood in a bottle complete with blood types for the picky fanged ones.Sookie Stackhouse is alone in this world but for her very promiscuous brother Jason and her remarkably open minded grandmother. She is alone also because of her ability to read minds and when Vampire Bill walks into her place of work, he is refreshingly blank paged and instantly she wants to still get into his brain. A whole world opens up to her both sexually and mentally, and her little town of Bon Temps is about to get bigger with  murder ,mystery and more of the supernatural. A persons gift can also be their burden and in this show its true with every character. What other series can explore what its really like to be a vampire? without it being tainted by black capes and angst and stereotypes?Sam the bartender, Lafayette the cook, Tara; Sookies best friend, Eric the vamp club owner, and all the citizens of Sookies small town are woven together, seeking out revenge, redemption, passion, wealth, and answers. What I love about this series is that its not all about Sookie, she is the main character but what would her life be without all of her neighbors and family and friends living thier lives parallel to hers? I know people who are upset that its not the ""sookie show"" I for one am glad that its not, these other characters are so fascinating and gorgeous, I want more and more and more!

What would they change? Who would they cast? Would they alter the plots around in order to make for better watching & would I like the changes? A few episodes down the line, I was hooked.If you haven't heard the plotline of True Blood then you have to have been hiding under a rock somewhere. In other words, I'm not going to bother going over the plotline here like I do in most of my other reviews. I'm just going to skip to what I thought.I love it! True, some of the characters have been changed (Tara is now far more involved than she was in the books & she's now related to Lafayette) but overall I can't help but like the changes, which is saying a lot for someone like me who is such a literary purist! The plotline has also been changed & extended a little. Some things that happened later in the book have been brought to the beginning of the series, but that's just for better plot flow.I adore the casting. I have to admit that I was skeptical of Anna Paquin as Sookie, but I like what she brings to the table. I also adore Lafayette- he's one of the best ones cast in the series. (I'm glad that they fleshed out his character more in the show- he was woefully underdone in the book series.)Over all, I really had nothing to complain about with this series.

Any one of these people can die in in this series and I would keep watching, but not care that they were dead.The fact that I would keep watching should tell you that the writers have done their jobs, because it IS a compelling show. Mostly because Vampires are cool and also because this show seems to cary untapped potential despite its lack of characters I care about. Tara continues to disgust me. In real life I imagine when confronted with someone as obnoxious as she is, I would want to knock her block off and I've never hit another person in my life!Another character that is hard to swallow is Tara's cousin, the gay/bi man. He has that ""I'm gay and I'm gonna throw it in your face whether you're anti-gays or not"" kind of attitude. I'm a teacher and I have gay students. The ones who act like him are accepted by the other studentrs as amusing, but they don't often have many friends. He, like Tara, is a ""guru"" on life kind of character that neither his age nor his life experiences should merrit. In all, the characters of Tara and her gay cousin come across as feeling as though they are more knowing/above all those around them and you get a litany of anti-white sentiment from them continuously. Not one character has treated either of the two black characters (Tara and her cousin) as anything less than equal and they still havbe this ""I don't like whitey"" veneer that begins to wear pretty thin, pretty fast. In one scene from an ealier episode where Bill the Vampire says his father owned two slaves, Tara later comments that, ""He didn't even apologize to me.""

In Season 2, he just looks overage and kind of impotent especially once Eric makes his appearance.  But in Season 1, it's obvious that Bill is no good.  He's a liar.  He's not just a predator looking to exploit a much younger, inexperienced fleshling living a life with no good future prospects.  Bill's a monster but worse than the obvious vampire trash who visit his home, he has career ambitions and he is hyper vigilant about maintaining his cloak of ""mainstreaming.""  Eric sees Bill for what he is.  Bill will do what his elders tell him to do.  Always. Sookie smells him out but when your world opens up its ugly maw and the power shifts from mortals to self-exposed monsters, you surf the wave.  Bill's presence among the mortals in Bon Temps is telling them that he and his ilk are here to stay and to flaunt how good he is at social mores but only the awful passive aggressive grandmother pretends to warm to him.  His appearance in the church was truly offensive.  He took down the AMERICAN FLAG off the cross as a gesture of disdain, contempt and defiance.  It's the same way he flash appears by Sookie's side on her porch or her side of the car.  It's not clumsy.  It's intentional.  It's not chivalry.  It's hunting intimidation.  Not even stalking.  And like a good old Southerner, Sookie knows.  She belongs with Sam but he's not strong enough to protect himself so Sookie blows him off to protect him.  Bill was never in danger in the final episode when he made an effort on Sookie's behalf.  This is no romance.

However, it was better than I imagined it would be. Sookie Stackhouse falls for Bill, who is a vampire that she rescued in the first episode. Her brother Jason is obsessed so to speak with sex and V in the first season. She has her best friend Tara who works with her at Sam's bar. Sam keeps secrets about his real identity from all his friends not wanting them to know.Lafayette I loved his character on the show. I thought he was entertaining to see each episode what he'd be wearing or doing. Sookie meets Eric in season one, which is why i bought the series. I did not find out till after I bought it she is with Bill in season one and most of season two. Near the end of the twelve episode season Bill is punished for taking the life of one of his own kind. As his punishment he is forced to take a life to make another vampire. Jessica is introduced in the last few episodes of this season.

1189017,A9NCQGVV5W8N0,B001FB4W0W,"darklordzden ""darklordzden""","[3, 6]","The Present: After a Japanese corporation announces that it has perfected a synthetic blood substitute for use in emergency trauma surgery, the world is stunned by the revelation of the existence of Vampires who have decided to ""come out of the coffin"" and make their presence known to human society. Now that the synthetic blood (which is bottled like a beverage and sold as ""Tru Blood"") has eradicated the Vampires' need to feed on human prey, they are seeking the same recognition, rights and privileges as their human counterparts. Unsurprisingly, these fanged interlopers are treated with suspicion and fear - and nowhere more so than in the small town of Bon Temps, Louisiana, where the arrival of the town's first resident Vampire coincides with a spate of murders...HBO's ""True Blood"" had the potential to be one of the most intriguing takes on Vampire mythology ever to make it to the small screen, but unfortunately the only accolade it can really claim is that of being distinctly average. The whole thing is really no more than a winsome Vampire romance dressed up as ham-fisted social commentary. I'll be honest, I only made it through five episodes of season one due to the fact that it was so completely derivative and clich&eacute;d. What could have been a fascinating examination of cross-cultural miscegenation (or not) between two mutually suspicious species was eschewed in favour of the usual knuckle-bitingly tedious post Anne Rice/Buffy/Twilight tropes of Vampire bars; Vampire elders dressed like Goths; pale, ambiguously seductive bad boys and crass dream sequences featuring our heroine being ravished in her silky nightie.None of it is remotely original and while plentiful nudity and profanity may be revelatory to any fifteen year olds who are watching, to me it just felt like a cheap tactic designed to make a very silly, juvenile drama appear more adult.Also, in what must be one of the most unoriginal pieces of casting in TV history, British actor Stephen Moyer basically repeats his turn as an ambiguously motivated Vampire from the vastly superior late nineties British Vampire series,Ultraviolet. In fact, if you want to see an intelligent, adult, brilliantly plotted series which doesn't have to rely on onscreen shock tactics, I'd recommend ""Ultraviolet"" over this unreservedly - if only so you can see where ""True Blood"" borrowed the idea of synthetic blood causing Vampires to sue for peace.",2,Truly Bloodless,1259107200,"11 25, 2009",2009,2432,"['Present', 'Japanese', 'corporation', 'announces', 'perfected', 'synthetic', 'blood', 'substitute', 'use', 'emergency', 'trauma', 'surgery', 'world', 'stunned', 'revelation', 'existence', 'Vampires', 'who', 'have', 'decided', 'come', 'coffin', 'make', 'presence', 'known', 'human', 'society', 'Now', 'synthetic', 'blood', 'bottled', 'beverage', 'sold', 'Tru', 'Blood', 'eradicated', 'Vampires', 'need', 'feed', 'human', 'prey', 'are', 'seeking', 'same', 'recognition', 'rights', 'privileges', 'human', 'counterparts', 'Unsurprisingly', 'fanged', 'interlopers', 'are', 'treated', 'suspicion', 'fear', 'nowhere', 'more', 'so', 'small', 'town', 'Bon', 'Temps', 'Louisiana', 'where', 'arrival', 'town', 'first', 'resident', 'Vampire', 'spate', 'murders', 'HBO', 'True', 'Blood', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'intriguing', 'Vampire', 'mythology', 'ever', 'make', 'small', 'screen', 'unfortunately', 'only', 'accolade', 'can', 'really', 'claim', 'being', 'distinctly', 'average', 'whole', 'thing', 'really', 'no', 'more', 'winsome', 'Vampire', 'romance', 'dressed', 'up', 'ham-fisted', 'social', 'commentary', ""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'only', 'made', 'five', 'episodes', 'season', 'one', 'due', 'fact', 'was', 'so', 'completely', 'derivative', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd.', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fascinating', 'examination', 'cross-cultural', 'miscegenation', 'not', 'two', 'mutually', 'suspicious', 'species', 'was', 'eschewed', 'favour', 'usual', 'knuckle-bitingly', 'tedious', 'post', 'Anne', 'Rice/Buffy/Twilight', 'tropes', 'Vampire', 'bars', 'Vampire', 'elders', 'dressed', 'Goths', 'pale', 'ambiguously', 'seductive', 'bad', 'boys', 'crass', 'dream', 'sequences', 'featuring', 'heroine', 'being', 'ravished', 'silky', 'nightie.None', 'remotely', 'original', 'plentiful', 'nudity', 'profanity', 'may', 'be', 'revelatory', 'fifteen', 'year', 'olds', 'who', 'are', 'watching', 'just', 'felt', 'cheap', 'tactic', 'designed', 'make', 'very', 'silly', 'juvenile', 'drama', 'appear', 'more', 'adult.Also', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'unoriginal', 'pieces', 'casting', 'TV', 'history', 'British', 'actor', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', 'basically', 'turn', 'ambiguously', 'motivated', 'Vampire', 'vastly', 'superior', 'late', 'nineties', 'British', 'Vampire', 'series', 'Ultraviolet', 'fact', 'want', 'see', 'intelligent', 'adult', 'brilliantly', 'plotted', 'series', ""n't"", 'have', 'rely', 'onscreen', 'shock', 'tactics', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Ultraviolet', 'unreservedly', 'only', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'True', 'Blood', 'borrowed', 'idea', 'synthetic', 'blood', 'causing', 'Vampires', 'sue', 'peace']",True Blood: Season 1

I hate the Twilight series and how there seems to be a overly large fanbase for vampire romance, but when I saw how popular this show was and also its critical acclaim, I decided to give it a try and see what the fuss was all about. It turns out it is actually a very good show! I like the fact how there is a cliffhanger in every episode so you always feel this need to watch another episode. You don't feel as though it's a chore watching through these episodes too because there are various subplots going on at the same time also. The cast is pretty fantastic and they play their roles effectively, and the dialogue can be laugh-out-loud hilarious (in a good way), especially with Terra. I like the horror genre also, and the show also mixes thriller/mystery elements effectively that make it such an entertaining watch. There are many twists throughout the show also, which are often highly unpredictable. The cast gives off subtle comedy performances also that add to the show, giving it a nice twist. The only problem I have with the show is that I think the actress who plays Sookie was horribly miscast. Sure, she can put on a Southern accent, but she shows one-dimensional characteristics in her acting and she can't get angry or emotional in a convincing manner. I don't know. Maybe in later seasons she'll improve but we'll have to see.WATCH THIS SHOW NOW IF YOU HAVEN'T!",5,Extremely entertaining!,1369353600,"05 24, 2013",2013,1419,"['had', 'doubts', 'True', 'Blood', 'hate', 'Twilight', 'series', 'how', 'there', 'be', 'overly', 'large', 'fanbase', 'vampire', 'romance', 'when', 'saw', 'how', 'popular', 'show', 'was', 'also', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'out', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'like', 'fact', 'how', 'cliffhanger', 'episode', 'always', 'feel', 'need', 'watch', 'episode', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'chore', 'watching', 'episodes', 'too', 'are', 'various', 'subplots', 'going', 'same', 'time', 'also', 'cast', 'pretty', 'fantastic', 'play', 'roles', 'effectively', 'dialogue', 'can', 'be', 'laugh-out-loud', 'hilarious', 'good', 'way', 'especially', 'Terra', 'horror', 'genre', 'also', 'show', 'also', 'mixes', 'thriller/mystery', 'elements', 'effectively', 'make', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'are', 'many', 'twists', 'show', 'also', 'are', 'often', 'highly', 'unpredictable', 'cast', 'off', 'subtle', 'comedy', 'performances', 'also', 'show', 'giving', 'nice', 'twist', 'only', 'problem', 'have', 'show', 'think', 'actress', 'who', 'Sookie', 'was', 'horribly', 'miscast', 'Sure', 'can', 'put', 'Southern', 'accent', 'one-dimensional', 'characteristics', 'acting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'angry', 'emotional', 'convincing', 'manner', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Maybe', 'later', 'seasons', ""'ll"", 'improve', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see.WATCH', 'THIS', 'SHOW', 'NOW', 'IF', 'YOU', 'HAVE', ""N'T""]",True Blood: Season 1

I missed all the hoopla surrounding ""The Sopranos"" initially and finally caught that show on DVD after the finale aired. I've heard about ""True Blood"" on Howard Stern's radio show, as well as from co-workers, but didn't really feel compelled to see a lousy ""Twilight""-like vamp tale dragged out over a season's worth of episodes.When my wife expressed an interest in watching the show, I decided to pick up the box set as a gift for her. She asked if I would watch it with her, and having no interest and very low expectation I agreed as long as she didn't mind if I started to read a book once I lost interest. Once the show began to play out, the book and everything else I had planned to do was forgotten! I got addicted.""True Blood"" is not only a tale of vampires, it's a character driven show, and you really get to love the characters populating Bon Temps, Louisiana! The acting is phenomenal and Anna Paquin as Sookie Stackhouse is just amazing to watch. Sookie's relationship with vampire Bill Compton forms the backbone of the series, but Bon Temps is populated with a wide range of characters that you come to love (and hate), all living side by side with vampires. The overall story arch of this first season is that someone is killing women who have been with vampires (Fang-Bangers). There are so many twists and turns, edge of your seats moments, laughs, chills, scares and jaw-dropping revelations, that you cannot believe you are watching a weekly television series. ""True Blood"" packs more into a single hour long episode than most major theatrical films.Do your best to avoid any spoilers, because even a small spoiler will ruin quite a bit of the fun.

1189021,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B001FB4W0W,David J. Brown,"[2, 5]","I've never read the books that this show was based on.  I don't care how close or how far it strays from the source material, AT ALL.  I don't care to read the books and I never will.  From what I've read regarding the books, it doesn't sound like something I would find to be an entertaining read anyway.  Apparently, the book is told entirely through the Sookie Stackhouse character's perspective with her commentary and female wistfullness to go along with it.  YAWN!Sure, this show is done primarily from Sookie's point of view, but there is no voice overs or inner-monologues conducted from her character.  Thank you.  Sookie is played by Anna Paquin, and I mention her first because she is one of the very major factors in why this show really works so well.  She is charming, charismatic and turns in a multi-layered and totally relatable performance.  She grounds this series, which is way out there in the realm of fantasy.This show was created and written by(with co-writers obviously) by Alan Ball(Ocar winner for writing American Beauty and creator of Six Feet Under).  Admittedly, this show isn't on the same level of greatness as Six Feet Under, but as a horror fan, the addition of vampires gives me a slight bias for it.  Also, it's so addictive and intriguing in its first season that hopefully the only places left for it to go in further seasons is up.  Hope does spring eternal.Vampire lore is instantly turned on its head just by the main premise.  In True Blood vampires are common knowledge.  They co-exist with humans and all are aware of it.  A Chinese company invented a synthetic blood drink called True Blood so vampires don't have to hunt on humans anymore.  So, essentially it's safe for vampires to come out of the closet.  Of course, if you're a versed horror/vampire nut you just know that there are some ornary vamps out there who just aren't down with changing their centurys' old ways.The main storyline comes from an intense and passionate romance between a living woman and a vampire.  Yes, this does sound a lot like Twilight, but unlike that puff piece this show examines the real conflict and danger that comes along with loving one of the undead.  The characters are all likeable or at least intersting, interesting to the level of frustration(Sookie's brother)who is the town's local man-whore and is quite the moron. Without his character's bad judgements this show would have far less conflict.  Plus, the way this season ended, his arch is truly one of the more intersting.Of course with all the show's originality and pure rawness we still have the usual cliche's of the Southern Gothic tale.  Everyone knows each other, but everyone also has many secrets they keep and will of course all come to the surface.  There's tons of southern fried humor and hospitality and great scenery common to this genre.  And of course we get the usual vampire stuff.  They're torn and tormented.  They've had tragic pasts, some of which lead them to their current undead status.  It's all old hat, but this show does us the favor of presenting it in an original way.The DVD is pristine, if light on the special features.  We get a bunch of mock True Blood adds and commercials, and one mockumentary regarding the man and vampire situation around the world.  Thankfully, we get about seven commentary tracks on selected episodes, commentary tracks are the only note-worthy special features on DVDs these days anyway.  Plus, for an HBO show the price is awesome.The only thing I can fault this show for is the political satire.  No, i'm not against it being in the show, I just think in moments it's a little on the nose for my tastes.  Then again, if you know the actual definition of the word 'satire', maybe it should be on the nose.  Anyway, sometimes the somber drama and the political satire come at odds in an uneasy tone shift.  It's not often but it doesn happen on a few episodes.This show is an HBO show so, and thankfully so, it's loaded with violence(of the non-exploitive sort) and kinky sex.  It's all done with the characters' personalities in mind so calling it anything close to soft-core would be ignorant or narrow minded.  It's a show made for grown ups.  Grown ups have sex.  Most grown-ups, well maybe not in this country, enjoy sex and hold it in high regard.  If you can't handle it, then I would suggest you wait for this show to run in syndication on AMC or Bravo, like The Sopranos, and watch it filtered of all the boobies, girating simulated sex acts, blood, and those foul and nasty words, which can't really hurt you and say nothing about your character if you watch, or dare I say, enjoy watching a show with characters that speak them.This show is too good to pass up.  This set is a good price.  At least rent it and taste what I'm talking about here.

1189062,A3A4WQL80WOTMH,B001FB4W0W,Green Manalishi,"[0, 0]","Silly, half-creative, B-movie ""horror"" soap for the modern age. That the story takes itself seriously gives it a faint waft of black humour, a fine line that many HBO shows tend to ride.  This show is just ridiculous and yet I keep watching just to see what new absurdity will crop up.  The story lines are ludicrous, the characters and scenes nearly always have me on the edge of laughter - and yet, they'll come up with some new unseen twist in the story that brings me back in with renewed interest.  OK, of course you don't come to this show for beleivablity, but even within it's own logic, you have to be prepared for a few plot holes and far out plot devices.  It's got the narration style and character depth of a comic book, but it's all in good fun - I'd be lying if I said I haven't come to enjoy it.The first seven episodes are not ""glued to your set"" television moments.  More like you can do other things like surf on-line and only half tune in while characters engage in yet more over-the-top cliched dialogues.  It's a vampire soap with all the key HBO ingredients, sex, drugs, and language.  The whole ""V"" addiction thing was pretty interesting, as were exorcisms, and some other surprises.  Of course this show re-defines for us what a vampire is, and it's cleverness is that their whole race has entered the modern American world of PC and is struggling for an accepted place in mainstream society.  Funny!  By episode 7 I was starting to watch a little closer and with more genuine interest.  I wouldn't put it on par with classier HBO fare ""Six Feet Under"", ""Sopranos"", ""The Wire"", ""Damages"", ""Breaking Bad"" (AMC), or even ""Dexter"" (Showtime).  But as much as I know this show is ridiculous I still find myself watching it and often (but not always) with more than half interest.  This wouldn't be a series I'd recommend first to my friends, and I don't think it warrants the price.  But I accept what the show has become for me - a guilty (half) pleasure.

It is great to have two versions of this great story.I honestly believe nobody should watch this show without reading the books. There is only so much you can tell on the screen, and to really know the characters the best way is to read about them in more depth.The setting, the music, the scenery, the characters....this show creates such a convincing and different world that it draws you in and doesn't let go.In this day of moronic sparkly vampires, isn't it great to have real vampires - real men and women - who do things vampires are supposed to do?! This is a version of vampirism that is dark and sexy. It's fascinating.The cast does a great job. Anna Paquin is nothing like the Sookie of the books, but she's an incredible actress. Stephen Moyer is simply excellent as Bill, as are the actors playing just about every other role. Hopefully we'll get to see Eric doing his thing from season two on.A few minor quibbles I have are not enough for the show to lose a star, but they're quibbles all the same. The sex sometimes detracts rather than adds to the story. One scene in particular - of Jason on his own - was so unnecessarily disgusting I always skip it. And I do not understand the - uh - `medical problem' with his lower area. What was the point in that?Also, I get that Alan Ball wanted to build a love triangle, but Sookie getting it on with Sam while she feared for the life of the man she's supposed to love was just wrong.However, these faults were more than made up for with some wonderful additions to the story that only book readers will be able to fully appreciate.Plus you're never going to see a better opening title sequence!!This is, without a doubt, the best thing on television today.",5,Amazing - but also read the books!!,1244073600,"06 4, 2009",2009,1789,"['True', 'Blood', 'not', 'same', 'book', 'series', 'course', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'great', 'have', 'two', 'versions', 'great', 'story.I', 'honestly', 'believe', 'nobody', 'should', 'watch', 'show', 'reading', 'books', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'tell', 'screen', 'really', 'know', 'characters', 'best', 'way', 'read', 'more', 'depth.The', 'setting', 'music', 'scenery', 'characters', '.this', 'show', 'convincing', 'different', 'world', ""n't"", 'let', 'go.In', 'day', 'moronic', 'sparkly', 'vampires', ""n't"", 'great', 'have', 'real', 'vampires', 'real', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'do', 'things', 'vampires', 'are', 'supposed', 'do', 'version', 'vampirism', 'dark', 'sexy', 'fascinating.The', 'cast', 'great', 'job', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'nothing', 'Sookie', 'books', 'incredible', 'actress', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', 'simply', 'excellent', 'Bill', 'are', 'actors', 'playing', 'just', 'other', 'role', 'Hopefully', ""'ll"", 'get', 'see', 'Eric', 'doing', 'thing', 'season', 'two', 'few', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'have', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'show', 'lose', 'star', ""'re"", 'quibbles', 'same', 'sex', 'sometimes', 'rather', 'story', 'One', 'scene', 'particular', 'Jason', 'own', 'was', 'so', 'unnecessarily', 'disgusting', 'always', 'skip', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'uh', 'medical', 'problem', 'lower', 'area', 'What', 'was', 'point', 'Also', 'get', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'wanted', 'build', 'love', 'triangle', 'Sookie', 'getting', 'Sam', 'feared', 'life', 'man', 'supposed', 'love', 'was', 'just', 'wrong.However', 'faults', 'were', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'wonderful', 'additions', 'story', 'only', 'book', 'readers', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'fully', 'appreciate.Plus', ""'re"", 'never', 'going', 'see', 'better', 'opening', 'title', 'sequence', 'doubt', 'best', 'thing', 'television', 'today']",True Blood: Season 1

I have also read the books (after I saw the series), and I can tell you...the HBO series is much MUCH better.The first season of the HBO series is based upon the first Harris book, but the show has diverged quite a bit from that book, and rightfully so, in my opinion.  The producers astutely decided to veer away from the lightness of the novels towards a darker, edgier vision and in the process gave the story much more depth (MUCH more than is contained within the ""romance-novel"" flavored books).  Let's hope they stay the course!Arguably the best opening credits of any TV show, ever (MADMEN comes in a close second).

Never read any of her books. The market being flooded with tomes about the undead (Rice, Hamilton, etc., etc.), I just couldn/t chisel away enough time to catch up of on one of hers (although I did recently acquire the first three novels in a handy three-in-one anthology from Science Fiction Book Club!)Alas my review will be brief (since many have already seen the series and raved and another rave would just be another drop in the bucket). Praise goes to Alan Ball (the brainchild of another HBO original Six Feet Under) for his take on the south and having the vision to lay on the goth and supernatural extra thick in order to enthrall us with a world resembling ours with all its wonders and imperfections while at the same time never letting us forget that not all monsters have fangs and drink the blood of the living.By now its no mystery the two leads- Anna Paquin and Stephen Moyer- off set are an item. Which probably explains why the screen pops every time those two fill it. Talk about chemistry! Ana/s mind-reading Sookie Stackhouse is tender and painfully vulnerable while Moyer/s Bill Compton provides the dark, brooding undead (who also happens to the only person whose thoughts Sookie can/t read!). With the support of a strong ensemble cast- Tara Thronton (Sookie/s fiery best friend), Sam Trammell (the shape-shifting bar-owner), Ryan Quanten (Sookie/s philandering older brother), Nelsan Ellis (as the hilarious short-order cook), and a host of others, the show draws you into their outrageous lives with all the ease of a child to a sugary treat.Kudos of course goes to Louisiana for the setting of fictional Bon Temps and its atmosphere rife with seduction and plain ordinary charm. It provides the backdrop for which the stage of this explosive original is set.In conclusion, only HBO (with the exception of perhaps Showtime) could bring this very adult, hot-blodded, sexy, violent, compelling drama to the small screen (depending what size HD surround sound TV ya/ll may have!). I myself have no cable so I had to wait for the DVD box set (and will most likely wait for the next one as well). Ladies and gentlemen: this is what TV entertainment is all about.

1189105,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B001FB4W0W,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[0, 2]","I just got into this show on dvd and I strongly recommend it. I have no idea why I never heard more word of mouth about True Blood because it's the best show I have seen in awhile. It's a lot like Twilight...except there's nudity, sex and it's a hell of a lot more violent. It's about a mind reading Waitress named Sookie (Anna Paquin) who falls hard for a vampire named Bill (Stephen Moyer). Vampires are well known to the world, but no one trusts them. Some, prefer just to drink True Blood which is a blood drink sold for them even if it doesn't exactly fill their thirst completely. Bill is a peaceful vampire that drinks True Blood and who has never turned a human into a vampire. Kind of like Bella in Twilight, Sookie can read everyone's mind, except Bill. She likes that about him though, since she hears thoughts of others way too much.While there may be more to her boss Sam (Sam Tremmell) who has a big crush on her. He barks in his sleep and runs around the woods naked. He also isn't supportive to her relationship with Bill. Is he the person killing vampire supporters close to Sookie ? The police think he's a suspect, while her brother Jason (Ryan Kwanten) is also a suspect since he slept with 2 of the victims.Jason also gets hooked on vampire blood which is just called V by it's users. It has a strong trippy effect that he gets hooked to. He gets so hooked though that it starts to put a strain on his relationships with people close to him. His addiction also causes him more trouble than it's worth as the season goes on.True Blood is a smart and well acted show that has a lot going for it. Twilight fans may find it to be a total rip-off from the sound of my review but the books that the show is based on might've been around before Twilight. But am not sure how much the show goes by the books since I never read them. There's not really too much to compare between the 2. Except what I mentioned already. The Twilight books are pretty good but this show is way better than the movie that's extremely over-rated by it's fans. If you haven't started watching it...then start!

Extended View is only available on Blu-Ray.  Digital copy does not include any special features.2. Blu-Ray discs only hold 1-3 episodes each, meaning you will swap discs frequently.3. Hard to read the tiny text on Extended View pop-ups.  Would be nice to have a font size parameter.4. Sometimes the Extended View pop-ups mess up and stay on the screen.5.

Kind of difficult to say, oh well this plot is blablabla when the whole thing is fantasy land. I think that's what it is mostly- fantasy romance land. It's an undisguised, unapologetic, vampire romance. If that's not your thing, you might not like it. If it is your thing, the storyline follows the major principles of the top romance novelists. but why spoil the magic?

Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[0, 0]","This show's blend of horror-flick fervor and soap operatic complexity makes a worthy successor to the 1960s schlock TV classicDark Shadows.  It's boisterous, unsubtle, hilarious, philosophical, and grim all at once.  Loosely based on Charlaine Harris' first supernatural crime novel,Dead Until Dark, this redneck vampire showdown taps common human fears to create a narrative arc which scares more with creeping dread than with startles and jumps.Sookie Stackhouse has no luck with men, even though she looks just like Anna Paquin.  Maybe it's because she hears others' thoughts.  Bill Compton's brain is mercifully silent, since he's a vampire.  But just as Sookie and Bill's romance starts to build real heat, a killer strikes her hickish Louisiana town.  As bodies mount up, vampire evidence becomes hard to ignore, and the violence circles closer to Sookie and her family.Family drama and hard-boiled crime dominate this story; the vampire element (and some other supernatural angles that are pretty poorly concealed) seems almost ornamental.  This story is about characters who fear losing control, and tremble as they see their lives spinning further from their grasp.  We share their fear because we can imagine ourselves all too easily in their situation, struggling to maintain equilibrium while pity dies on the vine before us.The story does occasionally threaten to disappear up its own navel, primarily toward the middle of the series.  Perhaps the writers needed time to recoup their strength.  The characters' exaggerated mannerisms (and accents!) become distracting when the show doesn't give them enough to do.  And the show introduces several plot elements which, I can only imagine, come to fruition in the second season, because they're nonstarters here.But when a series demonstrates this much energy and thought, I shouldn't nitpick.  I don't rattle easily at TV, yet this show had me clutching the arms of my chair as it shot from one bizarre circumstance to another with the ease and restraint of Space Mountain.  It's paced like a rocket, urgent as a heart attack, and spirited as a rodeo clown.

I really liked them.I watched the first season of Blood Ties on DVD, because of the books.  If I had watched this show on HBO, I would never have purchased the set.  I realize that movies and TV shows are usually not as good as the books, but D___.  I only watched the whole season, because it was a little expensive, and I didn't want to watch one or two episodes and declare it a bad show.There was way too much gratuitous sex and violence. The actors were neither attractive or in any way likeable.  The acting was bad.  It was way too much like really bad porn.  It was more like the middle to later books of the Laurell K Hamilton Anita Blake series, all flash and no substance.The fact that Charlaine Harris (from what I could find on a search) seem to think it was just fine, lowers my opinion of her and makes me question my good opinion of the Sookie Stackhouse books.I ended up giving the set to a person with a stronger stomach, and will never no way purchase or watch this show again.

I watched the series on HBO and then bought the DVD set before I ever picked up the books. Now that I've caught up with all of the books, there are drawbacks to each. I can certainly ""see"" the characters better putting a face with the books. I understand that the secondary characters had to be developed to flesh out the rest of the show (i.e., Jason, Tara (who's not even in book one), and Lafayette (who's barely in book one). Bill's ""child"" came totally out of nowhere, but I absolutely loved her character on the show, and looking forward to more of her.I understand that we HAD to see beyond Sookie, I get that, but I hope the development of these secondary characters don't overshadow Sookie. She is the show and for the most part, I like Anna Paquin's portrayal. It will certainly be interesting to see what Alan Ball does with Bill's character  as other contenders for Sookie emerge (she practically has a harem of men). Since he's been cast as a lead, I don't see Stephen Moyer really going anywhere, plus his engagement to Anna Paquin is also setting the stage for more Bill in the TV series. I'm hopeful that Alan Ball will allow Bill's image to get ""dirty"" and I don't mean crawling out the ground covered in dirt dirty. His later actions in the books should even up the playing field for the villification done to Eric Northman's character. Alexander Skarsgard lives fully up to his role as Eric, even though we see so little of him in the first season. His second-in-command, Pam, is also a delight both on the screen and in the books, so I was very excited to see she was pushed up to a cast regular!Anxiously awaiting Season 2 on DVD, and hopeful that I pursuade the hubby to let us get HBO again, so I can stay caught up with Season 3!",5,One of my best buys...,1261612800,"12 24, 2009",2009,1862,"['grew', 'up', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'Buffy', 'was', 'eager', 'watch', 'True', 'Blood', 'when', 'came', 'out', '2008', 'watched', 'series', 'HBO', 'then', 'bought', 'DVD', 'set', 'ever', 'picked', 'up', 'books', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'caught', 'up', 'books', 'are', 'drawbacks', 'can', 'certainly', 'see', 'characters', 'better', 'putting', 'face', 'books', 'understand', 'secondary', 'characters', 'had', 'be', 'developed', 'flesh', 'out', 'rest', 'show', 'i.e.', 'Jason', 'Tara', 'who', 'not', 'even', 'book', 'one', 'Lafayette', 'who', 'barely', 'book', 'one', 'Bill', 'child', 'came', 'totally', 'nowhere', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'character', 'show', 'looking', 'forward', 'more', 'her.I', 'understand', 'HAD', 'see', 'Sookie', 'get', 'hope', 'development', 'secondary', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'overshadow', 'Sookie', 'show', 'most', 'part', 'like', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'portrayal', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'Bill', 'character', 'other', 'contenders', 'Sookie', 'emerge', 'practically', 'harem', 'men', 'been', 'cast', 'lead', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', 'really', 'going', 'anywhere', 'engagement', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'also', 'setting', 'stage', 'more', 'Bill', 'TV', 'series', ""'m"", 'hopeful', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'will', 'allow', 'Bill', 'image', 'get', 'dirty', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'crawling', 'ground', 'covered', 'dirt', 'dirty', 'later', 'actions', 'books', 'should', 'even', 'up', 'playing', 'field', 'villification', 'done', 'Eric', 'Northman', 'character', 'Alexander', 'Skarsgard', 'fully', 'up', 'role', 'Eric', 'even', 'see', 'so', 'little', 'first', 'season', 'second-in-command', 'Pam', 'also', 'delight', 'screen', 'books', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'see', 'was', 'pushed', 'up', 'cast', 'regular', 'Anxiously', 'awaiting', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'hopeful', 'pursuade', 'hubby', 'let', 'get', 'HBO', 'again', 'can', 'stay', 'caught', 'up', 'Season', '3']",True Blood: Season 1

1189158,A2MF2QVSCUI27G,B001FB4W0W,"Luan Gaines ""luansos""","[24, 29]","I was determined to resist HBO's True Blood, a Southern Gothicky romp through Bon Temps, Louisiana, where, thanks to the invention of synthetic blood, vampires have ""come out of the coffin"" to mainstream with humans. One such creature of the night is Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer), a 173 year-old reluctant vampire who has all the candor of a good heart but the physical attributes of the netherworld. Bill is enchanted by Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Pacquin), a waitress at Merlotte's, the town watering hole. Tormented all her life by the ability to read other people's thoughts, Sookie and Bill stare at one another across the crowded bar like Maria and Tony in their memorable scene from West Side Story, the world falling away before the two of them. Hopelessly attracted, yet fearful of Bill's bad boy side (after all, he is a blood-slurping vampire), Sookie vacillates, her heart telling her this is the one, her mind screaming, ""Are you crazy? He's dead!"" But- unexpected joy- she can't read his thoughts! Certainly, these two will never be able to gaze lovingly at one another across the breakfast table.As the opening credits suggest in Alan Ball's clever and ambitious series, the south harbors the gamut of human- and inhuman- behavior, superstition, faith, love, hate, folksiness and generosity, charm and the KKK, all God's children frolicking in a world both dark and light. While vampires lurk in the night, seductive in their dangerous otherness, humans range from good ol' boys to southern belles, a m&eacute;lange of the dramatic and the demure, the cast a surprising mix of eccentric and fascinating personalities: Sookie's brother, Jason (Ryan Kwanten), a relentless sex addict who loves a mirror almost as much as the willing ladies her pursues; the foul-mouthed, yet endlessly appealing Tara (Rutina Wesltey), as unable to govern her emotions as she is to cast out the ""devil"" who inhabits her soul; and Lafayette (Nelsan Ellis), a real scene-stealer, gay short-order-cum-""V""-dealer (the potent and coveted vampire blood) who owns his scenes, his talented barely contained by the small screen.Unfortunately for the incipient romance between virgin and vampire, a series of recent murders has focused the town on the vampires' tendency toward blood lust, although, as Bill informs local law enforcement, ""Surely a vampire would have drained a body of every ounce of her blood."" Still, the residents of Bon Temps are reluctant to cast suspicion on one of their own. Bill's seduction of Sookie drives the series, but the town is filled with such a delightful mix of characters that, like ""V"", there is never enough. Highly addictive, like the one-step-behind law enforcement team who bicker from crime scene to crime scene, there is always another volatile contretemps to charm, amuse and shock the willing viewer.

Yes, vampires are real in this story and have been inhabiting Louisiana for hundreds of years, unbeknownst to the human population.  Now as they can portray themselves as non-threatening to humans, they have decided to mainstream into human society and are demanding equal rights.  Enter a vampire named Bill who purchases a house on Bon Temps, LA.  The same house he lived in during the civil war when he was alive.  A waitress named Sookie serves him True Blood at the local restaurant and it is True Love!  While the story is truly in the fantasy genre and doesn't get much respect, this series is very well made and very enjoyable.  Alan Ball of Six Feet Under fame developed the show and kept much of the same staff working on True Blood.  The actors are excellent and led by Anna Pacquin, the youngest person to win an acting Oscar.  The main story surrounding these two characters are the deaths of a series of women who have been having sexual relationships with vampires.  Sookie's brother, Jason who is very sexually active seems to have had relationships with all of them too.  Is it Jason who is killing the women?  Or are they vampires?  Along the way, we meet a group of interesting human characters and vampires.  This season tells a comprehensible story and well developed characters.

But True Blood is silly and fun and steamy and sexy and if you think a show is good with a couple of memorable characters, you're going to LOVE ""True Blood"" and its cast.  Minor characters make an impression and there are several performers who are near ""star"" status.I haven't read the Sookie Stackhouse Southern Gothic Vampire Novels that serve as the source material for the series, but I find these shows a great hoot.True Blood is set in Bon Temps Louisiana, a fictional parish in a fictional alternate universe where the Japanese have invented a synthetic blood product so good that vampires have been ""out of the coffin"" for two years.  The swampy backwater redneck town of this show would be pretty entertaining even without the vampires, but the setup is a pretty original take on the vampire story.Heroine Sookie Stackhouse (played by Academy Award winner Anna Paquin) is a waitress at Merlotte's diner, where owner Sam not so secretly pines for her and Sookie has to concentrate to not allow her telepathic powers overwhelm her as she ""hears"" the thoughts of the customers. (Since a plot point is what a relief it is for Sookie to NOT be around people and have to ""listen"" to their mental projections it is curious that she purposefully works at this job where she is surrounded by people all the time.  Wouldn't she have been happier as a solitary gardener or something?)Sookie has a brother named Jason, played by Ryan Kwanten.  Jason is all muscle and boiling sexual energy, with scarcely a thought in his head, but he is handsome and muscular and has no shortage of women around Bon Temps willing to satisfy his sexual urges.  (Sookie, by contrast, is a virgin as the show opens, and admonishes people for their actions and language around her.)  Sookie's best friend since childhood Tara is played by Rutina Wesley and although it appears that Tara is an ""angry black woman"" caricature, Wesley brings a tender vulnerability to the role that makes you pull for her, and laugh all the more when her in-your-face-and-in-your-bizness persona goes off on someone being stupid - which happens often in Bon Temps.  Tara has a cousin named LaFayette played by Nelson Ellis.  LaFayette is practically a one man greek chorus.  Flamboyantly gay, he exploits his sexuality and has insights into the nightgames of others.  He also conveniently works on the same construction crew as Jason during the day - and cooks at the same restaurant with Sookie and Tara and Sam, as well as being a freelance drug dealer and male prostitute.In the opening show we're introduced to Bill Compton, a handsome, brooding but gentlemanly vampire played by Stephen Moyer.  We find out that Bill is descended from the Comptons who have long since died out, and lives at the thought deserted old Compton place.  Bill was made a vampire at the end of the Civil War (which Sookie's Aunt, played by Lois Smith, thinks makes Bill an ideal person... er... Vampire... to speak at one of her ""Descendents of the Glorious Dead"" meetings.) Bill has ""gone mainstream"", which makes him something of an outsider to Vampires who think that a life... er.. uh... DEATH... on Tru Blood would be the equivalent of a human living forever on Slim-Fast.  Virgins, we're told, have particularly good-tasting blood, so some Vampires are envious that Bill has laid claim to Sookie.In addition to the new takes on Vampire mythology such as the synthetic ""Tru Blood"" and the fact that Vampire blood (sold by dealers such as LaFayette as ""V"") enhances the senses (in small 1-2 drop doses - one grisly/hilarious episode includes randy Jason greedily drinking a whole tube of ""V"" with a serious case of priapism resulting.)The show is also set up in classic serial format, with a mini cliff-hanger at the end of every episode and beginning at the next moment with the next episode.  You barely get a chance to catch your breath.There are deaths, but there is also love.  There is plenty of fornicatin', but for many characters you get a sense of their yearning for redemption as well.

If I thought all TV were like True Blood, I'd subscribe to cable.Our college-age daughter left the Season 1 DVD set with us when she back to school in September. We finally started watching Friday night, and had finished all 12 episodes by Monday. Sunday night we watched 5 episodes in a row. We probably would have watched them all at one sitting, but we have a 6-year old, and this is NC-17 stuff, so we could only watch after he went to bed.The writing, acting, editing and visual style on True Blood are consistently brilliant. The first episode was a little off-putting. Vampires don't much interest me . I can't stand Anne Rice, haven't tried Twilight, and never even made it through the novel or original Bela Lugosi film of ""Dracula."" My initial reaction was, ""This just looks like an excuse for soft-core porn."" But, we stuck with it, and by the second episode, we were completely hooked. It's done old-fashioned cliff-hanger style, so at the end of each episode, you can't wait for the next one. The characters are well-developed, multi-faceted and engaging. Stephen Moyer's Bill is the sexiest screen character since Harrison Ford in ""Witness."" The casting of Anna Paquin as Sookie perfectly enables the viewer to project himself or herself into the story: she's pretty and a fine actress, but down to earth enough that women can imagine being her and men can imagine being with her. Someone like Angelina Jolie would overwhelm the part of Sookie. The key supporting roles of Sam, Sookie's boss at Merlotte's Bar and Grill, Jason, Sookie's horny imbecile of a brother, Tara, Sookie's hard-case best friend, and Lafayette, Tara's hilarious cousin, are very well played, as are most of the minor and temporary characters. The extremely imaginative scripts are full of suspense, insight and humor, and clever if somewhat obvious political satire if you choose to take it that way. (For example, Sookie's brother Jason bears a startling physical resemblance to Bush II, and gets himself into all kinds of messes by not thinking above his belt.)  The editing is super-tight, with no scene going on too long, and yet no character or situation feeling like it has not been given a chance to develop fully. You can almost feel the swampy Louisiana nights, complete with biting mosquitoes.So, suspend your disbelief, tuck the kids in bed, and get sucked into this intelligent, sexy, extraordinarily well-done Southern Gothic adult entertainment.",5,Wonderful Even if You Don't LIke Bloodsuckers (Vampires or TV),1255392000,"10 13, 2009",2009,2685,"['have', 'not', 'seen', 'TV', 'cable', 'broadcast', '16', 'years', 'going', 'bars', 'friends', 'houses', 'watch', 'things', 'World', 'Series', 'presidential', 'debates', 'occasionally', 'seeing', 'sitcom', 'visiting', 'relatives', 'thought', 'TV', 'were', 'True', 'Blood', ""'d"", 'subscribe', 'cable.Our', 'college-age', 'daughter', 'left', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'set', 'when', 'back', 'school', 'September', 'finally', 'started', 'watching', 'Friday', 'night', 'had', 'finished', 'all', '12', 'episodes', 'Monday', 'Sunday', 'night', 'watched', '5', 'episodes', 'row', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'watched', 'one', 'sitting', 'have', '6-year', 'old', 'NC-17', 'stuff', 'could', 'only', 'watch', 'went', 'bed.The', 'writing', 'acting', 'editing', 'visual', 'style', 'True', 'Blood', 'are', 'consistently', 'brilliant', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'little', 'off-putting', 'Vampires', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'interest', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'have', ""n't"", 'tried', 'Twilight', 'never', 'even', 'made', 'novel', 'original', 'Bela', 'Lugosi', 'film', 'Dracula', 'initial', 'reaction', 'was', 'just', 'excuse', 'soft-core', 'porn', 'stuck', 'second', 'episode', 'were', 'completely', 'hooked', 'done', 'old-fashioned', 'cliff-hanger', 'style', 'so', 'end', 'episode', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'next', 'one', 'characters', 'are', 'well-developed', 'multi-faceted', 'engaging', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', 'Bill', 'sexiest', 'screen', 'character', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Witness', 'casting', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'Sookie', 'perfectly', 'viewer', 'project', 'story', 'pretty', 'fine', 'actress', 'down', 'earth', 'enough', 'women', 'can', 'imagine', 'being', 'men', 'can', 'imagine', 'being', 'Someone', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'would', 'overwhelm', 'part', 'Sookie', 'key', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Sam', 'Sookie', 'boss', 'Merlotte', 'Bar', 'Grill', 'Jason', 'Sookie', 'horny', 'imbecile', 'brother', 'Tara', 'Sookie', 'hard-case', 'best', 'friend', 'Lafayette', 'Tara', 'hilarious', 'cousin', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'played', 'are', 'most', 'minor', 'temporary', 'characters', 'extremely', 'imaginative', 'scripts', 'are', 'full', 'suspense', 'insight', 'humor', 'clever', 'somewhat', 'obvious', 'political', 'satire', 'choose', 'take', 'way', 'example', 'Sookie', 'brother', 'Jason', 'startling', 'physical', 'resemblance', 'Bush', 'II', 'kinds', 'messes', 'not', 'thinking', 'belt', 'editing', 'super-tight', 'scene', 'going', 'too', 'long', 'yet', 'character', 'situation', 'feeling', 'not', 'been', 'given', 'chance', 'develop', 'fully', 'can', 'almost', 'feel', 'swampy', 'Louisiana', 'nights', 'complete', 'biting', 'mosquitoes.So', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'tuck', 'kids', 'bed', 'get', 'sucked', 'intelligent', 'sexy', 'extraordinarily', 'well-done', 'Southern', 'Gothic', 'adult', 'entertainment']",True Blood: Season 1

It's entertaining mainly because it's so freakin' awful to watch. The acting is terrible all around. Stephen Moyer's portrayal of Bill the vampire is marked by intense gazes and deep voices. (""Sookie!"") Anna Paquin plays ditzy, good-for-nothing Sookie, a gullible bimbo twit who gets herself into one scrape after another. (Did this actress seriously win an Academy Award?! The one time she attempts to act in Season 1 is when she grabs onto half of a pecan pie and SCREAMS at the top of her lungs: ""THAT'S GRAN'S PIE!"" Unbelievable. And also, I know it's mean, but girlfriend's gap-toothed mouth drives me absolutely crazy. Ever heard of Invisalign?!)The other thing that amuses me about ""True Blood"" is that a requirement of the show seems to be that someone must be naked in every other scene. I am in no sense a prude, but I have never seen so much gratuitous nudity on television before, even on HBO. There is nothing tasteful or elegant about it, and it does absolutely nothing to further the plot. I think the directors just like to include butt and boob shots whenever possible.I'll admit, there are some decent moments. Most of the characters are incredibly annoying and unlikeable, but Tara and Lafayette are by far my favorites, and I wish they were a more central part of the show instead of Mr. and Mrs. Can't Act Their Way Out of a Paper Bag (I mean Moyer and Paquin). I appreciate the way the show depicts the down and dirty nature of vampires: their pop-up plastic fangs are pretty ridiculous, but when they feed on humans, there's nothing neat and tidy about it. It's the massive bloody mess you'd expect it to be if you were hitting all the major arteries! Also, fans of the book will appreciate that the series sticks pretty close to the plot of the first novel, and the additions to the show are definitely for the better.Overall, ""True Blood"" has nothing on the likes of ""The Sopranos"" or ""Six Feet Under"" in terms of quality.

1189185,A1CDNTB7377YH2,B001FB4W0W,Michael A. Newman,"[0, 0]","Probably inspired by Anne Rice's novels, this new version of vampire lore is far more interesting than Blade, Underworld, Twilight, Buffy, etc.  It takes place in a small town in Louisianna and has a real Cajun feel to it.  The premise is that vampires have admitted their existance so a blood substitute (True Blood) has been developed and sold wherever beverages are sold.The first season centered on a vampire named Bill moving into a Louisianna town and he fascinates Suki who works a Merlot's, a local restaurant.  Probably the main reason for Suki's attraction is that she is a mind reader and when she lets her guard down she usually hears embarassing thoughts from her male suitors.  As Bill is undead, she is not able to read his thoughts and in her mind, she is able to have a ""normal"" relationship with him.The main themes are that the vampires are seeking civil rights and acceptance while a murderer is loose in the town, preying on women that are on friendly terms with vampires.  Suki's brother Jason always seems to be the prime suspect.As the season went on we were introduced to a whole society of vampires who mostly congregate at a bar in a nearby town.  It is always dangerous for humans to enter the bar as the story is they don't get out alive.  Of course Suki makes Bill take her there.  The head of the bar seems to be the local ""Don"" of the vampires and we later find out that he reports to a higher council, which dispenses swift justice with fury.I am really enjoying the show so far and look forward to the new episodes being launched in June!

Unfortunately I don't have HBO, so I purchased the series with the explicit understanding that it would be worth it. Guess what girls and boys it was....it rocked. What was most surprising is that I have read a couple Charlaine Harris novels and did not recognize that it was the same storyline (I must re-read when I get a chance). Anyway, in a nutshell the entire first season is a murder mystery revolving around the deaths of several women who are ""fang bangers"" or willing to have sex with vampires. Let me start over, perhaps I jumped too quickly into the plot and you are lost. I should explain a few things first. The vampires live openly with the rest of society due to a recently manufactured product known as ""True Blood"". This product is synthetic blood which the vamps can drink versus human blood. Of course there are opposing sides, the religious fanatics, the vamps and the rest of the world who are either curious about the entire ""vamp lifestyle"" or scared to death of what living with vampires could mean. Meanwhile, there is a rash of murders in a small Louisiana town that hint to either a vampire killer or a someone who wants to make it look like a vampire.Sookie Stackhouse is the main character and is a waitress at Merlotte's Diner. She also has a secret, she can hear people's thoughts. One night she overhears a couple plotting to harvest a vampire's blood to get ""high"". Apparently vampire blood enhances sexual experiences and fetches a pretty penny on the drug scene. Saving the vampire's life, Sookie begins a relationship with Bill, a hundred something year old vamp. Meanwhile, Sookie's brother, Jason (a simpleton and womanizer) appears to be the prime suspect in the recent murders in town. It seems that every woman he has sex with is turning up dead. Hot on the killer's trail is Officer Andy Bellefleur, who will stop at nothing to get the truth. There are several other characters to love in this series: Tara (her best friend); Sam (Merlotte's owner who has a secret...and it's not just that he has a crush on Sookie although he does); Nelson (a cross dressing/gay cook who sells vamp blood on the side); a gang of cool vamps; some religious fanatics; and a town full of interesting characters. As the plot unfolds, so does the genius writing of the show. What makes this series so wonderful is the build up to future storylines and an expectation of things to come. I definitely feel that I got a deal when I purchased the series. I definitely would recommend it, especially if you like shows like Nip Tuck, Sunny in Philadelphia, HBO's old series OZ or 6th Feet Under, Rescue Me......although True Blood does have more nudity. I think what makes all these series a hit is that they are edgy and offer something new to viewers. However, the challenge will be can the writers maintain the integrity of the show. I hope so and look forward to purchasing Season 2.",5,This series rocks!,1248739200,"07 28, 2009",2009,3005,"['Several', 'friends', 'assure', 'enjoy', 'paranormal', 'genre', 'should', 'watch', 'True', 'Blood', 'Unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'HBO', 'purchased', 'series', 'explicit', 'understanding', 'would', 'be', 'Guess', 'what', 'girls', 'was', '.it', 'rocked', 'What', 'was', 'most', 'surprising', 'have', 'read', 'couple', 'Charlaine', 'Harris', 'novels', 'did', 'not', 'recognize', 'was', 'same', 'storyline', 'must', 're-read', 'when', 'get', 'chance', 'Anyway', 'nutshell', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'murder', 'mystery', 'revolving', 'deaths', 'several', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'fang', 'bangers', 'willing', 'have', 'sex', 'vampires', 'Let', 'start', 'perhaps', 'jumped', 'too', 'quickly', 'plot', 'are', 'lost', 'should', 'explain', 'few', 'things', 'first', 'vampires', 'live', 'openly', 'rest', 'society', 'due', 'recently', 'manufactured', 'product', 'known', 'True', 'Blood', 'product', 'synthetic', 'blood', 'vamps', 'can', 'drink', 'versus', 'human', 'blood', 'course', 'are', 'opposing', 'sides', 'religious', 'fanatics', 'vamps', 'rest', 'world', 'who', 'are', 'curious', 'entire', 'vamp', 'lifestyle', 'scared', 'death', 'what', 'living', 'vampires', 'could', 'mean', 'Meanwhile', 'rash', 'murders', 'small', 'Louisiana', 'town', 'hint', 'either', 'vampire', 'killer', 'someone', 'who', 'make', 'look', 'vampire.Sookie', 'Stackhouse', 'main', 'character', 'waitress', 'Merlotte', 'Diner', 'also', 'secret', 'can', 'hear', 'people', 'thoughts', 'One', 'night', 'couple', 'plotting', 'harvest', 'vampire', 'blood', 'get', 'high', 'Apparently', 'vampire', 'blood', 'enhances', 'sexual', 'experiences', 'pretty', 'penny', 'drug', 'scene', 'Saving', 'vampire', 'life', 'Sookie', 'relationship', 'Bill', 'hundred', 'something', 'year', 'old', 'vamp', 'Meanwhile', 'Sookie', 'brother', 'Jason', 'simpleton', 'womanizer', 'be', 'prime', 'suspect', 'recent', 'murders', 'town', 'woman', 'sex', 'turning', 'up', 'dead', 'Hot', 'killer', 'trail', 'Officer', 'Andy', 'Bellefleur', 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'get', 'truth', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'characters', 'love', 'series', 'Tara', 'best', 'friend', 'Sam', 'Merlotte', 'owner', 'who', 'secret', 'not', 'just', 'crush', 'Sookie', 'Nelson', 'cross', 'dressing/gay', 'cook', 'who', 'vamp', 'blood', 'side', 'gang', 'cool', 'vamps', 'religious', 'fanatics', 'town', 'full', 'interesting', 'characters', 'plot', 'unfolds', 'so', 'genius', 'writing', 'show', 'What', 'series', 'so', 'wonderful', 'build', 'up', 'future', 'storylines', 'expectation', 'things', 'come', 'definitely', 'feel', 'got', 'deal', 'when', 'purchased', 'series', 'definitely', 'would', 'recommend', 'especially', 'like', 'shows', 'Nip', 'Tuck', 'Sunny', 'Philadelphia', 'HBO', 'old', 'series', 'OZ', '6th', 'Feet', 'Rescue', 'Me', 'True', 'Blood', 'have', 'more', 'nudity', 'think', 'what', 'series', 'hit', 'are', 'edgy', 'offer', 'something', 'new', 'viewers', 'However', 'challenge', 'will', 'be', 'can', 'writers', 'maintain', 'integrity', 'show', 'hope', 'so', 'look', 'forward', 'purchasing', 'Season', '2']",True Blood: Season 1

If a show gets enough positive buzz, I make the leap of faith and buy it on DVD or blu-ray for the extras. I enjoyed it so much that I watched the series in record time -- and it would have been faster had I not made a commitment to watch it with my husband. He really enjoyed it too, he just doesn't have my ability to completely OD on a show. True Blood is very good at cliffhangers and that pretty much compels you to watch the next episode right away.The show is definitely adult and every episode is packed with adult themes and activities. (While Sookie and Bill the vampire head towards greater intimacy at a fast pace, the show still milks the slightest reason to break them up, like any show.) It's nice to wrest the vampire them away from children and teenyboppers, although they probably watch this too, yeah? The concept is supposed to be dark, sexy, dangerous, and wrong. The dark humor is also welcome.I've watched the commentary for the pilot featuring Alan Ball -- pretty good -- but no other commentaries so far. The shows also feature an option for enhanced viewer. What this means -- and it is meant for subsequent viewings, but the show is rewatchable -- is that maps pop up to show you where the characters live, facts and hints are given, and Lafayette (a character on the show) pops in to give you some gossip or wisdom. It was an interesting way to make the world seem even more real and to fill in back story.Recommended for fans of the vampire myth, dark humor, the occasionally cringe-worthy moment, and the demented sensibilities of Alan Ball (Six Feet Under.)

True Blood goes off in different directions from the books, leaving (with me) a very different impression, maybe because when one reads, one to some extent creates the emphasis, but TV is more aggressive in emphasizing what it wants.  At first I enjoyed the expanded characters of Lafayette, Jason, and Tara, but I found that about halfway through season 1, these TV plot lines, particularly the endless scenes of Jason having sex and being an idiot, began to pall.  Too much sex, too much  blood, much less humor than the books.  My favorite feature of the books -- Sookie's matter of fact acceptance of vamps and shapeshifters, expecting them to behave according to the rules of civilized society -- is much less evident in the TV show.  Eric, a favorite in the books, isn't much in evidence in Season 1, but he gets off to a very unpleasan start -- hard to see how I could come to like him.  That said, the quality of the script, acting, photography, set, and everything else I notice about the TV show is really excellent, although different from the books.  Anna Paquin is a perfect Sookie, and Bill is so wonderful I can't understand how any fans can still prefer Eric.  I hope later episodes just please cut back on the number of sex scenes.

The Six Feet Under creator and American beauty writer adapted Charlaine Harris' Southern Vampire Series of Sookie Stackhouse novels with spectacular results with True Blood; which presents to us a world in which vampires not only exist, but are public knowledge.  Since I've never read any of the novels, I can't vouch for how faithful True Blood is to the source material, but what I can say is that Ball and co. have crafted a believable take on a tired theme.  Anna Paquin (X-Men, The Piano) plays Sookie: a Louisiana barmaid who just so happens to be able to read people's minds, a trick which both comes in handy and gives her a good share of headaches to boot.  Soon enough, her interest is piqued in Bill (Stephen Moyer), a 137 year old vampire with whom sparks start flying, much to the dismay of her dim-witted sex-addict brother Jason (Ryan Kwanten), her best friend Tara (Rutina Wesley), and her boss Sam (Sam Trammell) who has a few secrets of his own.  Oh yeah, there's also a serial killer running rampant targeting girls who have been with vamps, and soon enough has Sookie targeted as well.  With plenty of twists, turns, standout performances, and an undeniably sexy atmosphere to boot; True Blood makes for one of HBO's most addicting shows in quite some time.  Vets from other HBO shows are abound as well, including William Sanderson (Deadwood) and Chris Bauer (The Wire) as two investigating cops, as well as Lois Smoith as Sookie and Jason's nurturing grandmother.  All in all, even if you aren't a fan of vampire lore, give True Blood a chance, and you'll be quite surprised by what you find here.",5,"A delicious, bloody treat",1229040000,"12 12, 2008",2008,1686,"['Leave', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'put', 'new', 'kind', 'spin', 'old', 'theme', 'Six', 'Feet', 'creator', 'American', 'beauty', 'writer', 'adapted', 'Charlaine', 'Harris', 'Southern', 'Vampire', 'Series', 'Sookie', 'Stackhouse', 'novels', 'spectacular', 'results', 'True', 'Blood', 'world', 'not', 'only', 'exist', 'are', 'public', 'knowledge', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'novels', 'ca', ""n't"", 'vouch', 'how', 'faithful', 'True', 'Blood', 'source', 'material', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'Ball', 'co.', 'have', 'crafted', 'believable', 'take', 'tired', 'theme', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'X-Men', 'Piano', 'Sookie', 'Louisiana', 'barmaid', 'who', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'able', 'read', 'people', 'minds', 'trick', 'handy', 'good', 'share', 'headaches', 'boot', 'Soon', 'enough', 'interest', 'piqued', 'Bill', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', '137', 'year', 'old', 'vampire', 'whom', 'sparks', 'start', 'flying', 'much', 'dismay', 'dim-witted', 'sex-addict', 'brother', 'Jason', 'Ryan', 'Kwanten', 'best', 'friend', 'Tara', 'Rutina', 'Wesley', 'boss', 'Sam', 'Sam', 'Trammell', 'who', 'few', 'secrets', 'own', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'also', 'serial', 'killer', 'running', 'rampant', 'targeting', 'girls', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'vamps', 'soon', 'enough', 'Sookie', 'targeted', 'as', 'well', 'plenty', 'twists', 'turns', 'standout', 'performances', 'undeniably', 'sexy', 'atmosphere', 'boot', 'True', 'Blood', 'one', 'HBO', 'most', 'addicting', 'shows', 'quite', 'time', 'Vets', 'other', 'HBO', 'shows', 'are', 'abound', 'well', 'including', 'William', 'Sanderson', 'Deadwood', 'Chris', 'Bauer', 'Wire', 'two', 'investigating', 'cops', 'as', 'well', 'Lois', 'Smoith', 'Sookie', 'Jason', 'nurturing', 'grandmother', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'fan', 'vampire', 'lore', 'give', 'True', 'Blood', 'chance', ""'ll"", 'be', 'quite', 'surprised', 'what', 'find', 'here']",True Blood: Season 1

Comparing Twilight to True Blood is like comparing a health conscious puritanical breakfast of fruit and oatmeal with a greasy Southern feast of country fried steak, cheese grits and red-eye gravy.  True Blood is so much more satisfying in every way.  The setting is so atmospheric, the music so spellbinding, the sexuality so seductive, the secrets so intriguing and the characters so interesting that they made me go out and buy the first five books.  I read Dead Until Dark (the first book in the Southern Vampire Mysteries) in one day and in all honesty the tv series is better because the characters are more developed and all the extra side stories keep the story line from becoming too linear and rigid.  The creator does loosely follow the plot of the book though, which kept the series from being a sellout.  As for the actors they are superb - each and every one.  Favorites include the haunting Anna Paquin, Stephen Moyer who combines your classic Southern gentleman with an irresistible element of danger, and of course Alexander Skarsgard is absolutely spot on as the Machiavellian Eric.

After her grandmother is murdered, Sookie realy gets together with Bill.Sookie helps Eric and Bill kills another vampire in order to save her.  He goes off for a while and as punishment is forced to turn, Jessica, a young runaway, into a vampire.  Bill asks Sam to look after Sookie.  Sookie finds out that her boss, Sam is a shapeshifter.Sookie seriously starts investigating the murders.  Rene, the murderer, comes after Sookie and Sam realizing that it is him goes after Rene.  Bill wakes up and goes out into the daylight to try ot save Sookie.  She gets knocked out.  Sookie's connection with Bill wakes her up in time to save herself and kill Rene in self-defense.This is the first season of a pretty good series.

1189223,A2RLERHASR0RLP,B001FB4W0W,Peggy Stone,"[5, 8]","I began with four stars but by the time I finished - and I was fast-forwarding through all but the Bill scenes by then - I'd really had it with the gratuitous sex (it IS gratuitous, compared to the Sookie-narrated books, because we really don't need to see what the creepy brother does) and violence, not to mention that the idea of mainstreaming vampires tends to be lost in the cheap thrills and low humor. (Note: yes, the book is violent, but it's the difference between FINDING a dead body and having to watch the murder re-enacted over and over in your face, or having to watch gouts of blood clearly generated by hoses!) I began reading the books after the first two episodes, and they are SO much better in almost every way, other than the inspired casting of Stephen Moyer, who manages to give off a Civil War era vibe quite nicely and has terrific chemistry in his all-too-few scenes (few, since they allowed  supporting and invented minor characters to take over the series; even a major romantic interlude that should have been pure Sookie and Bill is  cross-cut with other characters, destroying the eroticism of the book's comparable scene). Sookie seems to have been dumbed down considerably, and Southern stereotypes abound. The series follows the book to the letter for the first 50 pages, then goes more and more off the rails, much to its detriment. (The vampire trial and its grungy setting was just... idiotic.) I'm going to finish reading the books and give up on the series, though I'm happy to insert Moyer's face and manner into the proceedings.",2,The Book is So Much Better,1243728000,"05 31, 2009",2009,1569,"['began', 'four', 'stars', 'time', 'finished', 'was', 'fast-forwarding', 'Bill', 'scenes', 'then', ""'d"", 'really', 'had', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'gratuitous', 'compared', 'Sookie-narrated', 'books', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'what', 'creepy', 'brother', 'violence', 'not', 'mention', 'idea', 'mainstreaming', 'vampires', 'be', 'lost', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'low', 'humor', 'Note', 'yes', 'book', 'violent', 'difference', 'FINDING', 'dead', 'body', 'having', 'watch', 'murder', 're-enacted', 'face', 'having', 'watch', 'gouts', 'blood', 'clearly', 'generated', 'hoses', 'began', 'reading', 'books', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'are', 'SO', 'much', 'better', 'almost', 'way', 'other', 'inspired', 'casting', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', 'who', 'give', 'off', 'Civil', 'War', 'era', 'vibe', 'quite', 'nicely', 'terrific', 'chemistry', 'all-too-few', 'scenes', 'few', 'allowed', 'supporting', 'invented', 'minor', 'characters', 'take', 'over', 'series', 'even', 'major', 'romantic', 'interlude', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'pure', 'Sookie', 'Bill', 'cross-cut', 'other', 'characters', 'destroying', 'eroticism', 'book', 'comparable', 'scene', 'Sookie', 'have', 'been', 'dumbed', 'considerably', 'Southern', 'abound', 'series', 'book', 'letter', 'first', '50', 'pages', 'then', 'more', 'more', 'rails', 'much', 'detriment', 'vampire', 'trial', 'grungy', 'setting', 'was', 'just', 'idiotic', ""'m"", 'going', 'finish', 'reading', 'books', 'give', 'up', 'series', ""'m"", 'happy', 'insert', 'Moyer', 'face', 'manner', 'proceedings']",True Blood: Season 1

But who would have thought a show involving the romance of a plucky young southern waitress and a vampire would actually keep me glued to the set for an entire week?  The combination of Alan Ball and Charlaine Harris provides one wild, unpredictable, although ultimately exhausting trip that includes just about everything but the kitchen sink--virgins, romance, vampires, serial killers, shapeshifters, rednecks, goths, sex and more sex, drugs, exorcisms, fangbangers, fundamentalist, etc.Yes it does go beyond what the book depicted, but heck it's if you can't bear to see any changes from the books then just stick to them and don't bother with the show!  Personally I think it does a great job in keeping with the plot line of the original, and any addition in the end complement rather than hurt the story (enhancing Tara's and Lafeyette's roles, and bringing in new ones, Jessica and Amy).There was so much going in the entire first season that it was not surprising that it started to lose steam at the end during the last two episodes.  However that was a very minor point considering the superiority of the previous episodes, and in general the quality of the writing and direction was consistently inspired and unflagging in its pacing.  And of course the actors, all too numerous to mention, never struck any false notes: Anna Paquin, Stephen Moyer, Rutana Wesley, Nelson Ellis, Ryan Kwanten, Sam Trammell, Lois Smith, Lizzy Caplan, Adina Porter, etc.However an advisory also needs to be stated that this is not a kids' show by any means with its sexual content, nudity, mature themes, drug use, foul language, and all round gleeful vulgarity.  And especially not for the easily offended!  Furthermore those expecting absolute fidelity to the original or those unable to keep suspension of disbelief please stay far away from this series.

However, kind friends mainline this series two or three shows at a time, and they got me hooked: were I to be completely honest, I might have to admit to giving serious thought to obtaining this by less-than-legal-means.  It actually might be worth jail time.Speaking as someone who was born in America's deep South, this series captures everything about Louisiana that is appealing.  (Spanish Moss, vampires, latent racism and homophobia, the dichotomy between Christian Southern values and patriarchal, brutality-enforced poverty, sassy Southern women who know how to fight with chains, etc.)What it makes it really stand out, though, is the casting:  there isn't a bad actor in the bunch--and they are all believable as Southern archetypes.  Nelsan Ellis as the short order cook/drug dealer Lafayette and Stephen Moyer and Anna Paquin as the romantic leads give mesmerizing performances.True Blood, or possibly the original series of books from which it arose, is an arresting set of stories:  Faulkner says that the only thing really worth writing about (or thinking about, by extension) is the human heart in conflict with itself.  The Southern United States depicted in True Blood is conflict embodied--you are a supposed to be a good Christian, and follow the rules of an established society, but you live in the middle of a swamp so dense and wild that it believably could be home to minions of Satan, like vampires.It's a lot to think about.  If you are one of those artistic/professional types with too much to do, don't start watching this;  it becomes an obsession.And Now:  A Short Review of the Actual DVD--this is the regular, not Blu-Ray version, as my $100.00, cigarette-burned, pawn shop t.v. doesn't do Blu-Ray.Price: $10.00 less than my local electronics store.Extras: There is some very funny stuff here that was not on the original websites for the series:  ads for lawyers for vampires; vampire hotels; vampire dating, all done with the appropriate levels of fake bad acting and camp.Don't be afraid to look at the French language ad as well.  It uses all of six French words which you probably already know.There is also a short video parody of someone like Hugh Downs doing an in-depth report on vampires.  Complete with bad video backgrounds for foreign locales and hokey vampire internet conspiracies, this is a well-done, satirical background take on some of the 'vampire movement's more glossed-over history.One negative:  the commentary tracks play over the original episodes; it's neat to watch for about five minutes, and then it's a little bit like dissecting a romantic relationship--the mystery dies once the magic involved gets out into the bright light of day.However, overall, True Blood Season One is well worth watching again--particularly in the pilot episode, the acting, and the effort the cast and crew put into characterization and detail, is even more obvious the second time around.",5,Completely addictive.

Anna Paquin was the perfect casting choice to play the odd Sookie, who has the rare ability to hear the thoughts of people around her. Paquin also has an unusual virginal sensuality about her that works well with the subject matter. The Vampirism that centralizes the series uses many of the usual cliche's of the historical vampire legends, but it never takes it's subject too seriously, which is why this works so well. It's often very comical in the way it creates sarcasm out of the subject of vampires co-existing with humans, and the series gives the audience the opportunity to experience what the world might possibly be like if Vampires did exist and were attempting to establish themselves among the living as entities that should have all the rights and fair treatment that every american citizen should deserve and expect. The series introduces us to that situation as though it has been a long standing and generally accepted fact of life. It's a normal and acepted part of life reality in Sookie's world, and it makes for some seriously hysterical moments. The wit, humor, and interesting subject matter comes out of the day to day issues of humans living among vampires and how they relate to each other. All the characters in the series are interesting with well cast actors in these roles. Of course there is plenty of graphic language, sex, violence and plenty of blood. Somehow 'True blood' always seems refreshing and compelling even when it does have moments that could be thought of as boring. I especially love Anna Paquin's performace in this series. Not only is she absolutely gorgeous, but her acting is incredible through this entire first season.

1189236,AQR22MPF45M3P,B001FB4W0W,Rachel Ford,"[0, 0]","I had heard much about this series, but hadn't got around to watching it until I happened to see the DVD's at my local library...on a lark, I decided to give it a shot. All in all, I enjoyed it.The main storyline was interesting, if predictable at times, featuring Sookie Stackhouse, her interactions with her two love interests, Bill Compton and Sam Merlotte, and, of course, a series of inexplicable murders. The subplots are generally interesting too. The secondary characters are, perhaps, the jewels of this show. I particularly love Tara (Rutina Wesley) and Lafayette (Nelsan Ellis) -- the former because her character is so human and complex, and the latter because he's just so danged funny. (I seriously hope we see Rutina Wesley in more things in the future -- if her performance in this series is indicative of her overall acting skill, she is a talented actress indeed!) The others were superb as well, though. Her brother, Jason (Ryan Kwanten) is an oft detestable, and generally worthless, wastrel; the other vampires, with one notable exception, are heartless, soulless, and murderous...this is explained, in part, by the persecution they face (racial discrimination 2.0 -- this time, against the vampire ""race""), and, in part, by the newfound power given to otherwise normal human beings. The actors portray this convincingly (if not sympathetically).Now, the above stated, this show is very dark at times. It is gory (to the point of absurdity [think, exploding, gooey vampire sludge]) and full of sex (ranging from bondage/fetish to just plain ridiculous [such as the 'romantic' lovemaking between Bill and Sookie, when -- barebutt naked -- he pops out of the graveyard dirt, and (still covered in dirt) gets passionate...yeah, that's...disgusting...]). I can think of only one sex scene that was actually relevant to the story (and that certainly didn't need to be as graphic as it was); but, some people will like this, some will not. For those interested, it's there; for the rest of us, well, we can always skip it. Of course, everything that I had read about the series indicated that these elements could be expected, so it's hardly shocking...just know that it's there.As I mentioned earlier, one of the themes of this show is discrimination. Vampires are faced with, basically, the same sort of racial prejudice that African Americans faced, only now it's on the basis of ""human race"" versus ""vampire race"", instead of ""white race"" versus ""black race"". Vampires are fighting for civil rights, including owning/inheriting property; it is illegal for humans and vampires to marry; humans who sleep with vampires are thought of as disgusting and immoral traitors to their race; etc. The problem with this analogy, however, is that the only vampires we see, save Bill and one other, are truly detestable; they are cold, murderous, and cruel, and view humans only as prey. How are we supposed to sympathize with the plight of vampires when they themselves profess the views attributed to them by the religious fanatics who oppose them? In the struggle on which this was clearly modeled (the African American civil rights movement), the irrational, unfounded fears of racists were exactly that...irrational and unfounded. In this, the vampires themselves profess the same viewpoints that their opponents accuse them of holding...so, while their opponents are vitriolic and absurd, they are nonetheless what they are accused of being (and happily admit to being). This would have been so much more compelling if they had shown more than two good vampires -- especially when contrasted with so many evil ones. As it is, the romantic hero, Bill, and one lonely old vampire who falls in love with his prostitute, are the only ""human"" vampires we see in the entire thing...the others mercilessly slaughter humans, freely abuse them, and openly profess to viewing humans as naught but servants. Hard to be sympathetic... (Although later seasons may improve this image of vampires...I've only seen season one so far).All in all, I give this 4/5 stars for a generally well done, if trite or silly at times, adult vampire story.",4,"Vampires, shape shifters, killers, and fiends...oh my!",1298160000,"02 20, 2011",2011,4139,"['had', 'heard', 'much', 'series', 'had', ""n't"", 'got', 'around', 'watching', 'happened', 'see', 'DVD', 'local', 'library', 'lark', 'decided', 'give', 'shot', 'enjoyed', 'it.The', 'main', 'storyline', 'was', 'interesting', 'predictable', 'times', 'featuring', 'Sookie', 'Stackhouse', 'interactions', 'two', 'love', 'interests', 'Bill', 'Compton', 'Sam', 'Merlotte', 'course', 'series', 'inexplicable', 'murders', 'subplots', 'are', 'generally', 'interesting', 'too', 'secondary', 'characters', 'are', 'perhaps', 'jewels', 'show', 'particularly', 'love', 'Tara', 'Rutina', 'Wesley', 'Lafayette', 'Nelsan', 'Ellis', 'former', 'character', 'so', 'human', 'complex', 'latter', 'just', 'so', 'danged', 'funny', 'seriously', 'hope', 'see', 'Rutina', 'Wesley', 'more', 'things', 'future', 'performance', 'series', 'indicative', 'overall', 'acting', 'skill', 'talented', 'actress', 'indeed', 'others', 'were', 'superb', 'as', 'well', 'though', 'brother', 'Jason', 'Ryan', 'Kwanten', 'oft', 'detestable', 'generally', 'worthless', 'wastrel', 'other', 'vampires', 'one', 'notable', 'exception', 'are', 'heartless', 'soulless', 'murderous', 'explained', 'part', 'persecution', 'face', 'racial', 'discrimination', '2.0', 'time', 'vampire', 'race', 'part', 'newfound', 'power', 'given', 'otherwise', 'normal', 'human', 'beings', 'actors', 'portray', 'convincingly', 'not', 'sympathetically', '.Now', 'above', 'stated', 'show', 'very', 'dark', 'times', 'gory', 'point', 'absurdity', '[', 'think', 'exploding', 'gooey', 'vampire', 'sludge', ']', 'full', 'sex', 'ranging', 'bondage/fetish', 'just', 'plain', 'ridiculous', '[', 'such', ""'romantic"", 'lovemaking', 'Bill', 'Sookie', 'when', 'barebutt', 'naked', 'graveyard', 'dirt', 'still', 'covered', 'dirt', 'passionate', 'yeah', 'disgusting', ']', 'can', 'think', 'only', 'one', 'sex', 'scene', 'was', 'actually', 'relevant', 'story', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'as', 'graphic', 'was', 'people', 'will', 'like', 'will', 'not', 'interested', 'there', 'rest', 'well', 'can', 'always', 'skip', 'course', 'everything', 'had', 'read', 'series', 'indicated', 'elements', 'could', 'be', 'expected', 'hardly', 'shocking', 'just', 'know', 'there.As', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'one', 'themes', 'show', 'discrimination', 'Vampires', 'are', 'faced', 'basically', 'same', 'sort', 'racial', 'prejudice', 'African', 'Americans', 'faced', 'only', 'now', 'basis', 'human', 'race', 'versus', 'vampire', 'race', 'instead', 'white', 'race', 'versus', 'black', 'race', 'Vampires', 'are', 'fighting', 'civil', 'rights', 'including', 'owning/inheriting', 'property', 'illegal', 'humans', 'vampires', 'marry', 'humans', 'who', 'sleep', 'vampires', 'are', 'thought', 'disgusting', 'immoral', 'traitors', 'race', 'problem', 'analogy', 'however', 'only', 'see', 'save', 'Bill', 'one', 'other', 'are', 'truly', 'detestable', 'are', 'cold', 'murderous', 'cruel', 'view', 'humans', 'only', 'prey', 'How', 'are', 'supposed', 'sympathize', 'plight', 'vampires', 'when', 'profess', 'views', 'attributed', 'religious', 'fanatics', 'who', 'oppose', 'struggle', 'was', 'clearly', 'modeled', 'African', 'American', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'irrational', 'unfounded', 'fears', 'racists', 'were', 'exactly', 'irrational', 'unfounded', 'vampires', 'profess', 'same', 'viewpoints', 'opponents', 'holding', 'so', 'opponents', 'are', 'vitriolic', 'absurd', 'are', 'nonetheless', 'what', 'are', 'accused', 'being', 'happily', 'admit', 'being', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'compelling', 'had', 'shown', 'more', 'two', 'good', 'vampires', 'especially', 'when', 'contrasted', 'so', 'many', 'evil', 'ones', 'romantic', 'hero', 'Bill', 'one', 'lonely', 'old', 'vampire', 'who', 'love', 'prostitute', 'are', 'only', 'human', 'see', 'entire', 'thing', 'others', 'mercilessly', 'slaughter', 'humans', 'freely', 'openly', 'profess', 'viewing', 'humans', 'naught', 'servants', 'Hard', 'be', 'sympathetic', 'later', 'seasons', 'may', 'improve', 'image', 'vampires', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'season', 'one', 'so', 'far', '.All', 'give', '4/5', 'stars', 'generally', 'well', 'done', 'trite', 'silly', 'times', 'adult', 'vampire', 'story']",True Blood: Season 1

1189241,A3C4BVBA22741E,B001FB4W0W,ReaderFanatic,"[1, 4]","I had my reservations about this series. Having seen some of the trailers before the series came out, I was disappointed in what I saw, but still gave the series a chance. The first four episodes were atrocious to me, simply horrible and boring. I had given up hope for the series and didn't bother to watch the rest. A dear friend of mine, who was also disappointed, but continued to watch informed me that the series had gotten better. So I have recently decided to check out the rest of season 1's  last 8 episodes.The Pros: The humor has tickled my funny bone, so that's good. I enjoy Tara's character to a point, as she comes off as realistic, just wish she wasn't so angry, but I do understand why she is. Lafayette is my favorite character at this point, love him. The vamp scenes in the show aren't the best, I do dislike when vampires tend to waste a lot of blood when they should be lapping up every drop simply for the sake of making them look ghoulish,  but they do hold my interest such as the ""Judgment"" scene in which Bill had to face his punishment. That was entertaining to me.The Cons: Still, not a handsome face to be seen amongst these characters. I'm sorry, I don't see how anyone can find the men in this series gorgeous. It had nothing to do with them being pale. Bill looks like a old drunk. Eric has enough bags under his eyes to go to Europe, not to mention he's just not attractive. Which hurts my feelings, cause I love Eric from the books. These are the same ""men"". And I'm so sick and tired of Jason's character all together. He's not cute, though his body is nice, however, that doesn't stretch with me. Not only that, I'm so bored with the sex scenes in this series, especially since so many involve Jason, a character I could care less about. Not too mention, if I wanted to see ugly people having sex, I could watch 70's porn and get the real thing.I've never really liked Sookie that much, but in the series she's kind of psychotic, claiming love for Bill, but kissing Sam, then getting mad at Bill for giving a damn. And it's odd that she's so accepting of vampires, but when Sam reveals who he is, it's just ""too much for her to handle"". Yeah, right. She comes off as stupid too. If you could read ppl's minds, and there's someone in town trying to kill you, she should have braved the negative comments and read everyone's mind every day until she found the killer. So, there was a problem with the plot, it was weak.So tired of Jason and his druggy V trips, I didn't know what to do. I started fast-forwarding past all things Jason, stopping only to view the interaction between him and the vampire he kidnapped.The special effects are just so laughable, I swear, I HATE the sound the fangs make when they come out or go in. Why, WHY do they make that ejector sound as if a tape is ejecting out of a VCR? And watching Eric and Pam ""roll"" away in episode four left me in stitches.And one more gripe. I'm sure Alan Ball thinks he's being so bold and bad with this little series, but I'm not impressed. Why is it, I have great detailed viewing of all the HETERSEXUAL sex in the series, but all HOMOSEXUAL scenes are fade to black? Why is it, we don't get to see Lafayette, (who mind you, is the cutest guy in the whole series,) have sex with men? On both occasions, he left the camera and that was that. Eric is also Bi-sexual too, will we be seeing him get freaky with men. And if memory serves me correctly, Bill and Eric have ""had relations"" before too, is that going to be explored.

They can now come out of the closet (er, coffin) and go mainstream with the mortals.  So far so good.  With this premise HBO weaves a reasonably logical and consistent plot that generally works.But all is not bliss in vampire USA because there are a bunch of idiosyncrasies that might bother some people.  The main location is in some small town in Louisiana, that's filled with 20 or 30 year old, 2% fat, beefcakes and cheesecakes.  And sex, don't forget about sex.  Everybody loves it, including the vampires.Also, the people of this quaint locale are dropping off like flies.  While they haven't had a murder in the last 10 or 20 years, mortals and vampires are now getting bumped off in droves.  And they don't go quietly or cleanly.And did I mention the girl who reads minds and loads of other strange happenings ....As long as the above doesn't stop you from running and screaming out of the room, you will probably like True Blood.  What makes the first season fun is the clever writing from HBO.  There is a feeling of reality to the vampire based situations and often with a sense of humor.  For example, when the main babe meets Bill the vampire, she asks,  ""Bill?  What kind of vampire name is that?  I was expecting Anton or Xavier, but not Bill.""My only real complaint about True Blood is the soap opera feel to it.  Sex, death, and gore has never scared me away from movies, but some of the plot twists in the first season might.  Did he/she/it really do that, have it happen to them, etc. etc.  Perhaps that's what breaks the tension and allows you to not take True Blood too seriously and still come back next week.That said, the first season was good enough to come back for refills of True Blood.",4,HBO's vampire soap,1253491200,"09 21, 2009",2009,1842,"['out', 'nice', 'premise', 'company', 'Japan', 'designs', 'synthetic', 'human', 'blood', 'guess', 'what', 'vampires', 'can', 'use', 'can', 'now', 'come', 'closet', 'er', 'coffin', 'go', 'mainstream', 'mortals', 'So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'premise', 'HBO', 'reasonably', 'logical', 'consistent', 'plot', 'generally', 'works.But', 'not', 'bliss', 'vampire', 'USA', 'are', 'bunch', 'idiosyncrasies', 'might', 'bother', 'people', 'main', 'location', 'small', 'town', 'Louisiana', 'filled', '20', '30', 'year', 'old', '2', '%', 'fat', 'beefcakes', 'cheesecakes', 'sex', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'sex', 'Everybody', 'including', 'vampires.Also', 'people', 'quaint', 'locale', 'are', 'dropping', 'off', 'flies', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'murder', 'last', '10', '20', 'years', 'mortals', 'vampires', 'are', 'now', 'getting', 'bumped', 'off', 'droves', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'quietly', 'cleanly.And', 'did', 'mention', 'girl', 'who', 'minds', 'loads', 'other', 'strange', 'happenings', '.As', 'long', 'above', ""n't"", 'stop', 'running', 'screaming', 'room', 'will', 'probably', 'True', 'Blood', 'What', 'first', 'season', 'fun', 'clever', 'writing', 'HBO', 'feeling', 'reality', 'vampire', 'based', 'situations', 'often', 'sense', 'humor', 'example', 'when', 'main', 'babe', 'meets', 'Bill', 'vampire', 'Bill', 'What', 'kind', 'vampire', 'name', 'was', 'expecting', 'Anton', 'Xavier', 'not', 'Bill', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'True', 'Blood', 'soap', 'opera', 'feel', 'Sex', 'death', 'gore', 'never', 'scared', 'away', 'movies', 'plot', 'twists', 'first', 'season', 'might', 'Did', 'he/she/it', 'really', 'do', 'have', 'happen', 'etc', 'etc', 'Perhaps', 'what', 'tension', 'not', 'take', 'True', 'Blood', 'too', 'seriously', 'still', 'come', 'back', 'next', 'week.That', 'said', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'come', 'back', 'refills', 'True', 'Blood']",True Blood: Season 1
1189253,A1MIFU0YKLG40T,B001FB4W0W,Rick Galati,"[4, 5]","""Must see"" TV for me is defined as watching every episode of ""True Blood"" on Sunday night as originally aired then rewatching and savoring each episode as recorded on demand. We watched the first season of ""True Blood"" over and over again yet highly anticipate the preordered DVD just so we can view each episode with director and cast member commentary. For instance, at the 42 minute mark in the final episode of the season, Ryan Kwantin who plays Sookie's brother Jason comforts his sister recovering  from the brutal beating she suffered and as Jason turns to leave, trips over the coffee table and nearly falls on his face. I personally think that pratfall was an accident. I'm guessing creator Alan Ball decided to retain that scene because it worked so well and so naturally to define  troubled yet likeable Jason's basic humanity. The commentary track normally included with most DVD packages should disclose if my suspicions are correct.  It will be fun to find out either way.Virtually every single cast member in this wickedly funny and at times shockingly graphic series is so believable and so downright likeable that the basic story line of vampires coming out of the closet in Louisiana to openly walk among us while demanding equal rights has an uncommon way of encouraging the casual viewer to examine his or her own personal prejudices in off beat, highly entertaining and altogether unexpected ways.Of course there will always be those who grouse that the storyline does not strictly follow the series of books by Charlaine Harris. Series creator Alan Ball argues there is a very good reason for that. The fact is Anna Paquin, recent Golden Globe winner for her turn as Sookie Stackhouse would be the most overworked actress on the planet if the storyline was strictly adhered to because as the books are written she would dominate virtually every single scene. Whew! Not only that, we would not have become so familiar with several of the wonderful characters we have been introduced to, specifically Tara, Jason and Lafayette as played by Rutina Wesley, Ryan Kwanten, and Nelsan Ellis respectively. These and many, many other gifted actors contribute mightily to making ""True Blood"" the runaway hit it has become. As any ardent fan of the book series knows, Season One barely scratched the surface and plenty of rich material has yet to be mined. If the series continues to be skillfully written, ""True Blood"" can easily air for 3, 4, even 5 or more seasons. We ain't seen nuttin yet!Alan Ball has done it again. Good for him. Good for us.

1189254,A2XAQOWHRPY98K,B001FB4W0W,"Rick R. Reed ""Seattle Book Lover""","[1, 2]","True Blood is based on the Sookie Stackhouse books by Charlaine Harris, which I have read about six of (there are nine or ten in the series so far, I believe). I am completely nuts about these books and find them perfect escapist fiction, filled as they are with a mind-reading bar maid, shapeshifters, werewolves, witches...and lots and lots of vampires. And it's all set in a charming little Louisiana backwater town called Bon Temps. The books are really cool...and way better than those Twilight books.Anyway, I was really excited to see the DVD of the first season of True Blood since it was based on these books I can't get enough of, but also because the series had Alan Ball behind it, the creator of another of my all-time entertainment favorites, Six Feet Under. I (gulp) pre-ordered my DVD set from Amazon months before it was even out because we no longer subscribe to HBO and I was too impatient to wait for the series to come piecemeal via Netflix.So, this week the boyfriend and I hunkered down in front of the HD TV every night and devoured the series in about four sittings, much like a hungry vampire at a hemophiliac's convention.Did it live up to my expectations? Oh yes, and in some ways, even surpassed them. From its opening credits (some of the best I've ever seen), True Blood is a true masterpiece of television. It has just the right southern goth vibe, perfect casting, and a storyline that will keep you guessing right up to the end, provided you haven't read the books. And if you have read the books, you'll enjoy it even more. Ball takes some liberties with Harris's literary territory, but his changes only serve to expand and improve on what Harris wrote.My only dilemma?

1189255,A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5,B001FB4W0W,R. Kyle,"[0, 0]","I've been a fan of Charlaine Harris's mysteries long before the Southern Vampire Series came out.  That being said, I viewed the coming of the series with some mixed emotions. I really needn't have worried, while the series is a loose interpretation of the books, I think the producers and actors depict the heart of the story with grit and humor.This 12-episode disk roughly coincides with the first Sookie Stackhouse novel, ""Dead Until Dark"" which introduces you to Bon Temps Louisiana, Sookie, and her family.  The novel takes place right after the vampires 'come out' since the Japanese have invented a synthetic blood product called ""True Blood"" which meets all their dietary needs without having to feed on humans.  There's a movement to grant vampires full rights of citizenship and of course, the right and left wingers are lining up on either side.  A lot of action occurs in this short span of time. The body count is pretty high, including two waitresses from the local bar, Merlotte's, Sookie's grandmother, three vampires, and one of their fang-bangers. The local police are stymied about who committed the crimes and the anxiety level is near a fever pitch.Meanwhile, people are getting addicted to vampire blood, which turns out to be better than cocaine. ""Drainers"" are killing vamps for their blood and addicts are paying a large chunk of change to get the life-expanding and libido-boosting formula.Sookie herself is learning about love for the first time. A telepath, she's never been able to get close to a man since she knows what they're thinking. The vampire, Bill Compton, is the first individual who she cannot read. This worsens her reputation in the hidebound little town that seems to thrive on gossip.The acting's on-key for the campy, scary, erotic nature of the stories. For me, the cast is very close to the vision I had in my head of the characters. The music's also great, adds the perfect Southern Louisiana touch to the whole story.My one-star deduction is for the video quality.  A couple of the DVDs had long pauses in the middle and the sound quality had slight variances.  Acceptable, but not good enough for a 5-star rating.Rebecca Kyle, August 2009",5,Erotic and campy with a great soundtrack 4.5 stars  (1/2 star deducation for disk quality),1251590400,"08 30, 2009",2009,2190,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Charlaine', 'Harris', 'mysteries', 'long', 'Southern', 'Vampire', 'Series', 'came', 'out', 'being', 'said', 'viewed', 'coming', 'series', 'mixed', 'emotions', 'really', 'need', ""n't"", 'have', 'worried', 'series', 'loose', 'interpretation', 'books', 'think', 'producers', 'actors', 'depict', 'heart', 'story', 'grit', 'humor.This', '12-episode', 'disk', 'roughly', 'coincides', 'first', 'Sookie', 'Stackhouse', 'novel', 'Dead', 'Dark', 'Bon', 'Temps', 'Louisiana', 'Sookie', 'family', 'novel', 'place', 'right', 'vampires', 'out', 'Japanese', 'have', 'invented', 'synthetic', 'blood', 'product', 'called', 'True', 'Blood', 'dietary', 'needs', 'having', 'feed', 'humans', 'movement', 'grant', 'vampires', 'full', 'rights', 'citizenship', 'course', 'right', 'left', 'wingers', 'are', 'lining', 'up', 'side', 'lot', 'action', 'short', 'span', 'time', 'body', 'count', 'pretty', 'high', 'including', 'two', 'waitresses', 'local', 'bar', 'Merlotte', 'Sookie', 'grandmother', 'three', 'vampires', 'one', 'fang-bangers', 'local', 'police', 'are', 'stymied', 'who', 'committed', 'crimes', 'anxiety', 'level', 'fever', 'pitch.Meanwhile', 'people', 'are', 'getting', 'addicted', 'vampire', 'blood', 'out', 'be', 'better', 'cocaine', 'Drainers', 'are', 'killing', 'vamps', 'blood', 'addicts', 'are', 'paying', 'large', 'chunk', 'change', 'get', 'life-expanding', 'libido-boosting', 'formula.Sookie', 'learning', 'love', 'first', 'time', 'telepath', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'get', 'close', 'man', 'what', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'vampire', 'Bill', 'Compton', 'first', 'individual', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'read', 'reputation', 'hidebound', 'little', 'town', 'thrive', 'gossip.The', 'acting', 'on-key', 'campy', 'scary', 'erotic', 'nature', 'stories', 'cast', 'very', 'close', 'vision', 'had', 'head', 'characters', 'music', 'also', 'great', 'perfect', 'Southern', 'Louisiana', 'touch', 'whole', 'story.My', 'one-star', 'deduction', 'video', 'quality', 'couple', 'DVDs', 'had', 'long', 'pauses', 'middle', 'sound', 'quality', 'had', 'slight', 'variances', 'Acceptable', 'not', 'good', 'enough', '5-star', 'rating.Rebecca', 'Kyle', 'August', '2009']",True Blood: Season 1

All the sex and nudity didn't bother me, except that it seemed they threw it in as often as possible so I found it tedious and would fast forward to get back to the story.

1189258,A16QODENBJVUI1,B001FB4W0W,Robert Moore,"[168, 194]","I'm not sure that any good series on the supernatural has ever tried as hard to be simply good fun.  It isn't the masterpiece that BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER was, but I don't think Alan Ball set his sights that high.  While Joss Whedon strove in BUFFY to create an icon and redefine television narrative, Ball just seems to want to tell a compelling story filled with memorable moments.TRUE BLOOD is, of course, based on the series of novels written by Arkansas writer Charlaine Harris.  The series was originally known as the Southern Vampire Mysteries, but has since come to be better known as The Sookie Stackhouse novels.  The premise is that a Japanese corporation has successfully created artificial blood, a product so like the real thing that vampires, previously relegated to feeding off humans in the dark, come ""out of the coffin"" and into society, intent on living off the new fake blood.  The series' title comes from the name of the artificial blood marketed and sold in stores.  The television series wisely does not try to hew too closely to the novels, though for the most part Sookie's story does.  And the way things turn at the end of the season, it is clear that Season Two (the show was renewed very early in the season) is going to pick up with the second novel in the series, though the action most likely will be in Bon Temps and not in Dallas (the second novel is entitled LIVING DEAD IN DALLAS).The major difference between the novels and the TV series is that while the novels focus almost entirely on Sookie, the series has elevated a number of secondary characters and padded out their story.  The focus on Sookie in the books is inevitable given that she is the narrator.  But since few shows attempt to tell a story primarily from one character's point of view (an exception is Season One of VERONICA MARS, in which the title character features in very nearly every scene), elevating several characters was a necessity.  Tara is a very minor character in the books (and white to boot), but on the show she is black and one of the most important characters.  Sookie's brother Jason is a moderately important character in the books, but definitely not as central as Bill, Eric, or Sam.  Tara was promoted on the show partly to balance out the show in terms of race and gender.  I'm not quite sure why Jason was made more important.  The story arcs that are given to these characters are not always successful, but they do give the show some diversity.  Lafayette, Tara's flamboyantly gay cousin and short order cook at Merlotte's, the tavern where Sookie is a barmaid, likewise is a major character on the TV series, but barely makes an appearance in the novels.I'm not always comfortable with the additions the show makes to the story and they usually are the weakest part of the show.  For instance, the long story of Tara's mother and her demon possession is an addition that I feel clutters the show, even as it raises the question of why Tara herself struggles with relationships.  The character of Amy, who is weirdly involved with Jason in the latter half of the season, sits on the rest of the story like a weird, disconnected appendage.  In fact, the entire obsession with V (or vampire blood, which is taken like a drug) is unique to the show and not the books, I think to the show's detriment.  Terry Bellefleur is a slightly more important character in the series, and about 20-30 years younger (and played by Todd Lowe, who played Zack, Lane's band mate/boyfriend/husband in THE GILMORE GIRLS), and a veteran of the Gulf War instead of the Vietnam War.  I don't expect for a show to be especially true to its source material.  I don't look for a scene-by-scene recreation.  But I do think that the additions show actually add something of value to the story.  All in all, I do not think the completely original aspects improved the overall story.There is a lot of controversy on boards where fans of the books linger about Anna Paquin.  Physically she isn't quite like how Sookie is described in the books, where she is far curvier and extremely busty.  I personally love Anna Paquin's performance.  She has a haunted, hunted look that someone who has had to struggle for years of hearing the thoughts of others might have.  She does very much seem to embody ""Crazy Sookie,"" as she is known to everyone in Bon Temps.  I also like all the actors who played the three other major characters from the books, Stephen Moyer as Bill, Alexander Skarsgaard as Eric (who will, given his stature as an actor and the precedent of the books, become a more important character in Season Two -- and let me just add, could anyone have been found more perfect to play Eric?), and Sam Trammell as Sam Merlotte.  My favorite performer to play a major role on the show but a minor one in the books is Nelsan Ellis, who also had a recurring role on the sadly short-lived THE INSIDE and was on an excellent episode of VERONICA MARS, and who on TRUE BLOOD plays Lafayette.  Though I have to add that he is s completely unbelievable character.  I've lived three years in a town not terribly distinct from Bon Temps and I can assert that you simply will not find many if any openly gay people and definitely not one a flamboyant one.All in all I really enjoyed the series TRUE BLOOD, though on the one hand I prefer the books (and I strongly recommend anyone who loves TRUE BLOOD to give the books a try, though I also warn them that the show does seem to be following to a greater or lesser degree the books -- Season Two is already set up to follow many of the second novel's storylines) and on the other I prefer Alan Ball's earlier show SIX FEET UNDER.  Still, it is a good, fun show.And can I just add that this show has my all time favorite opening credits.  It is filled with one astonishing image after another, from a coiled water moccasin to a Holy Ghost inspired preacher doing a 180 jump in church to lasciviously dancing strippers, all to a wonderfully appropriate song by country performer Jace Everett entitled ""Bad Things.""",4,A fun and adventurous take on vampires and the supernatural,1227744000,"11 27, 2008",2008,6056,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure',

1189262,ACRF1U3LAGCQT,B001FB4W0W,Rosie P,"[0, 0]","Fans of the Southern Vampire/Sookie Stackhouse novels will find some overlap as well as some discrepancies between the show and the books.  Both are fun new twists on the old vampire myth, but the show incorporates the artistic vision of Alan Ball into a truly unique production.  True Blood has an amazing ensemble cast, with fantastic performances and deeply nuanced characters.  The show is visually stunning at times, with color, light, and dark complementing the characters on screen. The subtle score, with smooth cello riffs in a minor key forms a stark contrast to the bluesy, twangy, hip songs of the soundtrack, and together make the emotions of the scenes pop. The interaction among the cast brings you into a world where you feel like you know these people, have shared a beer with them in Merlotte's and gone to Bon Temps football games with them.What really stands out - and is also a major theme of the books - is the grey area that exists between good and evil, an area shared by humans, vamps, shapeshifters, and everyone else.  Vampires are not evil, humans are not good.  They all show elements of light and dark through their actions, emotions, and relationships.

1189269,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B001FB4W0W,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[1, 2]","Alan Ball (Six Feet Under - The Complete Series Gift Set) takes on Charlaine Harris's belovedSookie Stackhouse, Books 1-7in True Blood, starring Anna Paquin as Sookie Stackhouse, a telepathic waitress in a small Louisiana parish. Sookie's gift is feared and misunderstood by the superstitious locals, although her boss Sam Merlotte (Sam Trammell) is sympathetic and longs to woo Sookie. Sookie lives with her grandmother Adele (Lois Smith) and her cat and has no romantic life to speak of; being able to read her dates' thoughts is a real turn-off. Her boring life is turned upside-down by the arrival of Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer), a vampire who's lived since the Civil War. In Harris's world, vampires have been ""out of the coffin"" for a couple of years and are seeking their civil rights, although Bill is the first vampire that Sookie's seen in Bon Temps.Rounding out the cast is Tara (Rutina Wesley), an uppity and downright disagreeable young woman with serious issues, Sookie's himbo brother Jason (Ryan Kwanten), who's into kinky sex and lots of it, and Lafayette (Nelsan Ellis), Tara's super-gay cousin who works as a short-order cook with a side of drug dealing. These three characters are given much larger roles than in the original novel, and this is not always an effective choice. Some of the invented side stories meander and eventually become loose ends that don't add to the storyline.One of the sticking points are the ""Southern"" accents; many of the leads aren't American (Paquin is originally from New Zealand, Kwanten is Aussie and Moyer is English), and the rest of the cast hails from various Southern states (Georgia, Tennessee, West Virginia). Generally, the accents don't noticeably distract (at least not for me, but I grew up in the northern US). Eric Northman is played by Swedish actor Alex Skarsgard (Generation Kill), and like in the books, he has a very slight accent that crops up from time to time (Alex also gets to say a few lines in Swedish).Ball and the various writers (including input from Charlaine Harris) useDead Until Dark: A Sookie Stackhouse Novel (Sookie Stackhouse/True Blood)as the basis for the major plot arcs of the first season, which will please fans. Dark humor lightens the tone, but the series is far more blood-drenched and sexed up than the books; nearly every episode features full nudity of Jason in various positions vigorously ""working out."" I could have done without the graphic sex or the constant string of profanity. There's also a lot of gore and violence towards women.  The special effects were generally good, although I disliked the drug trip sequences and thought that it took the series too far from its original destination. The music was spot-on and enhanced scenes with the right tone.The opening credits deserve special mention; the uneasy blend of decomposing animals, maggots, sex and salvation is brilliant. The feel of the series captures a backwoods small town trapped by poverty, steeped in alcohol, and fueled by evangelism. Ball draws several none-too-subtle analogies between vampires coming out and gay bashing; ""God hates fangs"" is a recurring theme, and there's a gay vampire that pleads for understanding. Lafayette's character is also discriminated against by several drunk rednecks who tell him that they don't want his ""AIDS burger."" There are also political statements not present in the original books; the vampire bar Fangtasia has a telling portrait of W. as a vampire greedily draining the neck of the Statue of Liberty, and Terry is an Iraq war vet suffering from PTSD who says that watching politicians on TV ""gives him seizures.""Extras include several tongue-in-cheek (fang in cheek?) parodies of cheesy ads for vampire dating services, True Blood commercials, and short promo pieces that were originally featured as viral videos on the True Blood website, as well as audio commenteries. Overall, True Blood does a good job of capturing the feel of the original novels and should please fans of the series.",4,Bloody good fun,1244246400,"06 6, 2009",2009,4012,"['Alan', 'Ball', 'Six', 'Feet', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Gift', 'Set', 'Charlaine', 'Harris', 'belovedSookie', 'Stackhouse', 'Books', '1-7in', 'True', 'Blood', 'starring', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'Sookie', 'Stackhouse', 'telepathic', 'waitress', 'small', 'Louisiana', 'parish', 'Sookie', 'gift', 'feared', 'misunderstood', 'superstitious', 'locals', 'boss', 'Sam', 'Merlotte', 'Sam', 'Trammell', 'sympathetic', 'longs', 'woo', 'Sookie', 'Sookie', 'grandmother', 'Adele', 'Lois', 'Smith', 'cat', 'romantic', 'life', 'speak', 'being', 'able', 'read', 'dates', 'thoughts', 'real', 'turn-off', 'boring', 'life', 'turned', 'upside-down', 'arrival', 'Bill', 'Compton', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', 'vampire', 'who', 'lived', 'Civil', 'War', 'Harris', 'world', 'vampires', 'have', 'been', 'coffin', 'couple', 'years', 'are', 'seeking', 'civil', 'rights', 'Bill', 'first', 'vampire', 'Sookie', 'seen', 'Bon', 'Temps.Rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'Tara', 'Rutina', 'Wesley', 'uppity', 'downright', 'disagreeable', 'young', 'woman', 'serious', 'issues', 'Sookie', 'himbo', 'brother', 'Jason', 'Ryan', 'Kwanten', 'who', 'kinky', 'sex', 'lots', 'Lafayette', 'Nelsan', 'Ellis', 'Tara', 'super-gay', 'cousin', 'who', 'short-order', 'cook', 'side', 'drug', 'dealing', 'three', 'characters', 'are', 'given', 'much', 'larger', 'roles', 'original', 'novel', 'not', 'always', 'effective', 'choice', 'invented', 'side', 'stories', 'meander', 'eventually', 'become', 'loose', 'ends', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'storyline.One', 'sticking', 'points', 'are', 'Southern', 'accents', 'many', 'leads', 'are', ""n't"", 'American', 'Paquin', 'originally', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Kwanten', 'Aussie', 'Moyer', 'English', 'rest', 'cast', 'hails', 'various', 'Southern', 'states', 'Georgia', 'Tennessee', 'West', 'Virginia', 'Generally', 'accents', 'do', ""n't"", 'noticeably', 'distract', 'least', 'not', 'grew', 'up', 'northern', 'US', 'Eric', 'Northman', 'played', 'Swedish', 'actor', 'Alex', 'Skarsgard', 'Generation', 'Kill', 'books', 'very', 'slight', 'accent', 'time', 'time', 'Alex', 'also', 'say', 'few', 'lines', 'Swedish', '.Ball', 'various', 'writers', 'including', 'input', 'Charlaine', 'Harris', 'useDead', 'Dark', 'Sookie', 'Stackhouse', 'Novel', 'Sookie', 'Stackhouse/True', 'Blood', 'basis', 'major', 'plot', 'arcs', 'first', 'season', 'will', 'please', 'fans', 'Dark', 'humor', 'tone', 'series', 'far', 'more', 'blood-drenched', 'sexed', 'up', 'books', 'nearly', 'episode', 'full', 'nudity', 'Jason', 'various', 'positions', 'vigorously', 'working', 'out', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'graphic', 'sex', 'constant', 'string', 'profanity', 'also', 'lot', 'gore', 'violence', 'towards', 'women', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'generally', 'good', 'disliked', 'drug', 'trip', 'sequences', 'thought', 'took', 'series', 'too', 'far', 'original', 'destination', 'music', 'was', 'spot-on', 'enhanced', 'scenes', 'right', 'tone.The', 'opening', 'credits', 'deserve', 'special', 'mention', 'uneasy', 'blend', 'decomposing', 'animals', 'maggots', 'sex', 'salvation', 'brilliant', 'feel', 'series', 'backwoods', 'small', 'town', 'trapped', 'poverty', 'steeped', 'alcohol', 'fueled', 'evangelism', 'Ball', 'several', 'none-too-subtle', 'analogies', 'vampires', 'coming', 'out', 'gay', 'bashing', 'God', 'fangs', 'recurring', 'theme', 'gay', 'vampire', 'understanding', 'Lafayette', 'character', 'also', 'discriminated', 'several', 'drunk', 'rednecks', 'who', 'tell', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'AIDS', 'burger', 'are', 'also', 'political', 'statements', 'not', 'present', 'original', 'books', 'vampire', 'bar', 'Fangtasia', 'telling', 'portrait', 'W.', 'vampire', 'greedily', 'draining', 'neck', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'Terry', 'Iraq', 'war', 'vet', 'suffering', 'PTSD', 'who', 'watching', 'politicians', 'TV', 'Extras', 'include', 'several', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'fang', 'cheek', 'parodies', 'cheesy', 'ads', 'vampire', 'dating', 'services', 'True', 'Blood', 'commercials', 'short', 'promo', 'pieces', 'were', 'originally', 'featured', 'viral', 'videos', 'True', 'Blood', 'website', 'as', 'well', 'audio', 'commenteries', 'Overall', 'True', 'Blood', 'good', 'job', 'capturing', 'feel', 'original', 'novels', 'should', 'please', 'fans', 'series']",True Blood: Season 1

""The Wire"" was amazing for lots of reasons, but it is my all-time favorite show because it was so deeply rooted in the real-world hell that is modern Baltimore.  This show reveled in its humanity as it indicted virtually every aspect of society, from the political to the religious to the educational system to journalism to the police to the citizens of the city themselves.  No other great HBO series has been so grounded in the real world while offering such riveting entertainment.""True Blood,"" on the other hand, is pure fantasy set in the Bayou Country of Louisiana.  This series, just like ""The Sopranos"" or ""Deadwood,"" is as out-of-this-world as ""The Lord of the Rings"" despite being set in the United States.  The township of Bon Temps, Louisiana, is one of those hole-in-the-wall burgs where, despite a classic Southern diet full of beer and crawfish, most of the leading characters could have just stepped out of a racy lingerie catalog.  Our heroine is Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin of ""The Piano"" and ""X-Man"" fame), a charming Southern belle who is cursed with telepathy - not the best superpower to have when you're a gorgeous waitress slinging pitchers of beer wearing hot pants and a clinging white T-shirt.Sookie's life is already strange enough, what with her telepathy and the fact that vampires now live among humans, allegedly thanks to a Japanese invention of synthetic blood that eliminates the need for vampires to treat humans like cattle.  (Anyone who believes that this has tamed the vampires, well, stand on your head.)  Sookie's brother Jason is the town boy-toy - all muscles and libiido, even when the women he's toying around with start showing up dead.  Her parents are dead (killed years ago in a flash flood) and has been raised by her charming grandmother.And then Bill shows up, and things get really strange.For Bill is a vampire - a Confederate soldier who is now all smouldering sexuality and chiseled physique.  The mutual attraction between Sookie and Bill is palpable, and their soon-torrid romance is the talk of the town between both humans and vampires alike.  (For those of you who first saw Ms. Paquin as an adorable cherub in her earlier films, be advised that this series is as raunchy as anything HBO has ever filmed.)As with all great HBO shows, there are too many intriguing supporting characters to mention.  Just when you think you're getting a handle on the storyline, a new character pops up or an unexpected revelation forces you to see an older character in a whole new light.  Thanks to some excellent writing, this tale of vampirism, voodoo, racism, sex, and that certain mystique that makes Louisiana the most romantic state in the country stays just on the good side of ridiculous.This is not PG-13 stuff, so I cannot say it is fun for the whole family.

Keeping along the lines of 'Six Feet Under' (Ball's first HBO series), death is everywhere, as well as vampires whom have come ""out of the coffin"" and now live amongst humans. Centered on a southern town in Louisiana, Bon Temps,mind reading waitress Sookie Stakehouse falls in love with 173 year old vampire Bill Compton, and the rest as they say is history. Along for the ride are memorable characters like Sookie's best friend, out-spoken Tara, her fabulously trashy gay cousin Lafayette, Sookie's idiotic brother Jason, and Sookie's boss Sam, whom is also in love with Sookie. The cast is all fantastic! Each player gets his/her own special time on screen and everyone of them are worth it.

This show is sex-fueled, comical, and usually unpredictable. These vampires definitely don't shimmer in the sunlight, and the show somehow brings a fresh perspective to one very overdone genre. I am looking forward to digging into season two. And I really never thought I'd be admitting that.Good things having been said though, it isn't all sunshine and the gay undead. There's a fair amount of cheesy acting at times (mostly among the main characters), and you'll find it hard to follow the mentality of certain characters from time to time. Every episode also ends in a cliffhanger. And I do mean EVERY episode. A show this off the wall should at least take the chance from time to time of ending an episode with a mystery solved. This is also one of the only shows I've ever seen that builds mystery upon mystery, while rarely resolving any of them. Personally, I don't think that's a bad thing. But I thought it pertinent to give any newcomer fair warning.This being my first season, I can say that (thus far) things are getting more and more interesting. The writing also seems to be getting stronger with each new episode. If nothing else, there is not another show like this out there to be had.

The Louisiana setting is perfect, what other state so lends itself to spookiness and the occult more than sultry Louisiana.  Really the state is a character, in and of itself, actually probably the most important of the series.  I have to agree with another review that the theme music is not the best, which is so unusual for an HBO series, think of how perfect the music was for Six Feet Under and the Sapranos, I would have perfered if they had used Lynyrd Skynyrds That Smell..like they did at the end of one episode, not that would have fit perfect..anyway, this series, well the few episodes that have aired, have been very good, not great, but I have faith this will be a typical great HBO series..One really annoying thing about the show is how the accents are all over the place, look ive spent time in southern louisana and everybody talks the same, I mean in True Blood, one guy sounds like he lives in the bayou, one girl sounds like she's from deep woods 'Bama, one dude sounds like he's from South Carolina, ..you get the picture, I mean how hard would it have been to have gone down to like New Iberia and sampled the accents and mimiced them, the southern Louisiana accent is very endearing, and that hard to grasp, ask Dennis Quaid...so get it right.  I really like the chemistry between Sookie and Bill, it's very hot and I agree Sam is very creepy, if I were Sookie it would be no contest between the two, even if Bill is part of the undead..i mean he's hot right?..I was sad..spoiler alert!!.that the killed of the grandmother, I always like that actress, she does those roles so well.

Too many snakes, fireants, grassburs, poison ivy, etc.I don't know anything about Alan Ball, but I think many of the changes he's made are not improvements.  I understand why he needed to make some of the characters' parts, especially Tara's, more important since the books are in the first person and from Sookie's point of view.

McKinney,"[0, 1]","Since I've been reading about Sookie and her doings for so many years, she's started to feel like my kid sister, I wasn't sure if I wanted to ever watch HBO's TrueBlood. I just had the feeling that the television show would never be able to measure up to my own imagination combined with Charlaine Harris's inventive storytelling.But I finally cracked, and I'm so glad I did. As so many other reviewers have noted, the television program differs from the books in many ways, but I've watched Season 1 twice through now, and I really think the series, at least in the first season, works really, really well.Anna Paquin's Sookie is brilliantly played, in my opinion. Right down to the gap in her teeth, she is a vulnerable girl in the process of becoming a steel magnolia. Watching her persevere through the hardship her ""disability"" causes is a moving experience, and exactly why the Sookie-of-the-books is so loveable.Many of the other characters in the cast don't disappoint either. Stephen Moyer (who says ""SOOkehhhhhhh"" in a way that absolutely lights my own blood on fire, baby)is a wonderful Bill; Sam's character isn't as he's described by Charlaine Harris, but hey, Sam Trammell, I am NOT complaining. Ryan Kwanten's Jason Stackhouse is so dead-on, I keep feeling like I'm going to run into him at the local Wal-Mart. And Lafayette, whose role in the books was pretty slight (ending up with his death) has completely stolen my heart. Tara, another character whose role in the novels was strongly reprised for the series, adds another storyline, but I'm not completely certain if it's one I'm going to be interested in for too long. Tara already tends to be, as Sookie would say, ""a Weeping Willa.""

1189290,A26A64X86VL1R4,B001FB4W0W,Snowbrocade,"[1, 2]","Prepare to be shocked and surprised by this series in every way. Alan Ball fans, forget his prior writing or you will be dismayed. True Blood is a perverse,tongue-in-cheek portrayal of, not only southern culture, but of vampire movies and literature.  Picture David Lynch's unsophisticated and melodramatic characters from ""Wild at Heart"" to get the flavor of the southern culture in this picture.Blood, sex and perverse aggression characterizes this series. In the first episode we learnt that vampires have only recently been openly recognized due to the manufacture of a synthetic blood drink,True Blood, that releases vampires from the necessity to prey upon humans to survive. The main character, strangely named ""Sookie Stackhouse"" (""Sookie"" with a southern accent sounds almost like ""suckie"")works at a bar set in a dark southern forest. Sookie is able to read people's minds, which causes her to interact strangely as she strives to interact while listening to what people are thinking all around her. One of her customers thinks that the rumors that Sookie is ""retarded"" must be true because of her vague and distracted manner.Then a vampire, Bill, enters the bar. Most of the clientele of the bar is hostile towards him but Sookie is strangely excited and welcoming though she must admit to him they do not carry True Blood. After the bar closes, the vampire is mugged by one of the bar's redneck clientele, Rattray, played by James Parks who previosly portrayed a vampire in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. In this series he plays a human vampire who is addicted to the high from drinking vampire blood.When Sookie leaves the bar she senses something is wrong and grabs a large chain coiled up in the back of a pick-up truck. She comes upon Rattray draining her new vampire friend Bill of his blood. Bill has been made helpless by being draped with silver chains by Rattray's female friend. Sookie beats up Rattray with the chain,nearly strangling him with it (the vampire he portrayed in Buffy was strangled) and releases vampire Bill. Sookie is immediately infatuated with Bill and fascinated that he cannot read her mind.The vampires in True Blood are violent, selfishly perverse and scornful of humans. Despite the fact that they are lobbying for equal rights with humans, their behavior is distinctly inhuman--thought the humans are no better. Sookie's brother is a young man who is constantly in trouble due to his poor judgement and excessive libido. There are frequent shots of him having sex and he rides his partners like he is astride a mechanical bronco.  A series of murders plagues the town and Sookie's brother and Bill the vampire are both prime suspects.This series centers around the romance between Sookie and Bill the vampire, the resulting unwanted attention she receives from both her human community and the vampire community as a result, the mystery of the serial murders, and the personal affairs of Sookie's brother and best friend.Both Anna Paquin, as Sookie, and Stephen Moyer, as Bill are a bit stilted in their roles. Paquin's interpretation of Sookie is as a shallow and brittle ingenue without much intelligence but fairly gutsy--she prances around in pigtails but then blithely nearly beats someone to death with a chain. Vampire Bill is only intermittently attractive and often seems ponderous and wooden-shades of Barnabas Collin's? It is hard to tell if these portrayals are purposeful or just representative of the best these actors have to offer. The supporting cast is much more vital and interesting, particularly Rutina Wesley, as best friend Tara, Nelson Ellis as a cross-dressing entrepreneur, and Michael Raymond-James as the token Cajun. William Sanderson is strangely lack-luster in his role as the sheriff--for such a seasoned and fluid actor this must have been a choice. The question is why? To further the strange atmosphere of this story?Despite the perplexing and cock-eyed strangeness of the characterizations and story, this eccentric and peculiar series grew on me. I was interested to find out the ending and will definitely watch season two. I needed to get over the seemingly unsophisticated script that seemed way out of character for Alan Ball in order to enjoy the torrid and sordid world of True Blood.

After the invention of a Japanese blood product (Tru Blood), the vampires ""come out of the coffin"" and survive without feasting on humans. Survival is one thing though and desire is another. The vampires find it hard to kick the human habit.The creator of True Blood, Alan Ball, also wrote Six Feet Under (Six Feet Under - The Complete Series Gift Set), and the similarities are apparent.  In the same way that Six Feet Under could have just been about a quirky family working in a funeral home or an intense family drama about people confronting their own mortality-depending on how you looked at it-True Blood is either a vampire thriller or a story about an alienated group of people trying to assimilate in a town where crosses are meant for worshipping, not killing.True Blood is the great type of show I've come to expect from HBO. It's lighter than Six Feet Under (but I was ready for that after bawling my eyes out at the end of that series). After wading through the gory sex scenes and rivers of blood, women are going to find the element of romance and relationships in this series appealing and men are going to like the sex and violence.

The style and direction was reminiscent of SFU at times, but generally this has a feel all of it's own. This follows life in Bon Temp, a Louisiana town, after vampires have come out of the closet and live openly amongst humans. The main character is Sookie Stackhouse who is telepathic, falls in love with a Vampire and starts to realise some of the dangers and complications this may bring. There is also another storyline where people are being killed in town and of course the vampires are the main suspects. The other characters are great to watch, whether it be Tara who is hard and cynical, Bill the charismatic vampire love interest, Sam the local bar owner who secretly loves Sookie, Lafayette who is the local drug dealer, short order cook and deliverer of some hilarious one liners or Jason who is Sookies brother and a bumbling ladies man. They are all great characters and there are also a whole host of other town folk who compliment the main cast. Some people criticise this series for it's sexual nature and no doubt this has plenty of nudity and sexual scenes, but this is mainly in the first half, relevant to the story and people seem to forget that the erotic nature of vampires has been a theme of the myth for years. This is a good series and highly watchable and you are soon immersed in the world created for you and as the series progresses plenty of surprises and twists are thrown up. There is a brief mock-u-mentary on the extras, as well as the obligatory commentaries but to be honest the extras are a little sparse overall.

I had customers asking about this since last year so I was interested in what Ball's latest foray was about. I had to spend a fair amount of money to risk having Blu depth on these TV on Blu sets - but this one did not disappoint me in any way. The story has been reviewed plenty here, so I dissected the features and quality.The picture looks very professional, and there was plenty to go wrong with the majority of it being filmed at night. The colors of the outdoors in each night landscape look vivid, and the special effects still appear adequate considering the difficulties of getting it right (darkly lit interiors). There is some sparse grain depending on the location, but it was a pleasure to see everything - plenty of flesh tones (yes there is lots of sex) that all look clear and porous.The sound is what sells this though. The DTS gets used extensively in each episode. Sookie's thought reading can be overwhelming at times, you almost want to isolate one of the channels and listen to that one thought as all five channels are sometimes filled with conflicting voices. Even the low-key scenes had some nice outer channel usage - loved every minute of it.The special features are catered to both the lay True Blood person like myself and the avid followers. Your player has to be enabled appropriately to handle all of the PIP and text boxes that appear in the enhanced viewing. The hints were somewhat corny at times, but I still learned some interesting things about the characters. The PIP is a solid 1080 and appears just little enough to not be that distracting on a first watch. The commentaries from Ball are the best, and provide some decent insight on his creative process while still getting a few slams in there on the critics and story changes.I think it is a great investment for the followers, and might be a worthy rental for those that are sitting on the fence about trying this.

Not because things are changed somewhat--you expect that in film adaptations--but the changes here are often damaging to the very things that made the books so much fun.  Season one, in all of its episodes, deals with the basic plot lines of the first book, ""Dead Until Dark"".First of all, in the books the lead character, waitress Sookie Stackhouse has a wonderful, wry, witty and slightly catty sense of humor.  She's reasonably smart, gracious, sexy, and lots of fun. That's totally gone here--Sookie as played by Anna Paquin is clueless, slutty, and shrewish--as if the entire series is a depiction of PMS.  In the book, although she works as a cocktail waitress, she is definitely a lady.  In the series she becomes trampy white trash.  In the books, Sookie's grandmother is pictured as an elegant, refined, kind if slightly old-fashioned lady.  In the series she dresses like a homeless person and is portrayed as kindly but hardly refined.Second--a lot of time is devoted to side stories involving minor characters whose characterization has been changed for no apparent reason other than to feature lots of sex and nudity.  Sookie's brother Jason is pictured not only as oversexed and not the sharpest tool in the box (as in the book) but as downright stupid, a drug addict and a bigot to boot.  And far too much time is spent on his sexual escapades.  Sookie's friend Tara becomes a major (and rather unpleasant) character here (as well as changing races).  The flamboyantly African-American cook Lafayette (who is portrayed sympathetically in the books) here becomes a dealer of particularly unpleasant drugs.  And Sam, Sookie's boss, who is a shape-shifter and a supernatural creature himself, by his unexplained and unreasoning hostility towards the vampires becomes much less sympathetic than in the book for no discernable reason.Third--there's a lot of gratuitous sex and pointless nudity.  The books have some graphic sex scenes in them--but they are all relevant to the plot or the characters.  This being HBO, you are treated to lots of naked bodies and simulated sex, regardless of the relevance to the story.  While the actors are all very attractive physically, this runs the risk of turning the series into soft-core porn.So in short--it's OK.  But I think you'll enjoy the books more.  They are funnier, more exciting and more interesting than the HBO series.",3,Disappointing Adaptation,1257292800,"11 4, 2009",2009,2726,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'Sookie', 'Stackhouse', 'books', 'Charlaine', 'Harris', 'series', 'based', 'TV', 'series', 'literally', 'OK', 'interesting', 'situation', 'vampires', 'come', 'coffin', 'thanks', 'synthetic', 'blood', 'need', 'attack', 'humans', 'fans', 'books', 'series', 'major', 'disappointment', 'Not', 'things', 'are', 'changed', 'somewhat', 'expect', 'film', 'adaptations', 'changes', 'here', 'are', 'often', 'damaging', 'very', 'things', 'made', 'books', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'Season', 'one', 'episodes', 'deals', 'basic', 'plot', 'lines', 'first', 'book', 'Dead', 'Dark', '.First', 'books', 'lead', 'character', 'waitress', 'Sookie', 'Stackhouse', 'wonderful', 'wry', 'witty', 'slightly', 'catty', 'sense', 'humor', 'reasonably', 'smart', 'gracious', 'sexy', 'lots', 'fun', 'totally', 'gone', 'here', 'Sookie', 'played', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'clueless', 'slutty', 'shrewish', 'entire', 'series', 'depiction', 'PMS', 'book', 'cocktail', 'waitress', 'definitely', 'lady', 'series', 'trampy', 'white', 'trash', 'books', 'Sookie', 'grandmother', 'pictured', 'elegant', 'refined', 'kind', 'slightly', 'old-fashioned', 'lady', 'series', 'homeless', 'person', 'portrayed', 'kindly', 'hardly', 'refined.Second', 'lot', 'time', 'devoted', 'side', 'stories', 'involving', 'minor', 'characters', 'characterization', 'been', 'changed', 'apparent', 'reason', 'other', 'feature', 'lots', 'sex', 'nudity', 'Sookie', 'brother', 'Jason', 'pictured', 'not', 'only', 'oversexed', 'not', 'sharpest', 'tool', 'box', 'book', 'downright', 'stupid', 'drug', 'addict', 'bigot', 'boot', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'sexual', 'escapades', 'Sookie', 'friend', 'Tara', 'major', 'rather', 'unpleasant', 'character', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'changing', 'races', 'flamboyantly', 'African-American', 'cook', 'Lafayette', 'who', 'portrayed', 'sympathetically', 'books', 'here', 'dealer', 'particularly', 'unpleasant', 'drugs', 'Sam', 'Sookie', 'boss', 'who', 'shape-shifter', 'supernatural', 'creature', 'unexplained', 'unreasoning', 'hostility', 'vampires', 'becomes', 'much', 'less', 'sympathetic', 'book', 'discernable', 'reason.Third', 'lot', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'pointless', 'nudity', 'books', 'have', 'graphic', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'relevant', 'plot', 'characters', 'being', 'HBO', 'are', 'treated', 'lots', 'naked', 'bodies', 'simulated', 'sex', 'regardless', 'relevance', 'story', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'attractive', 'physically', 'risk', 'turning', 'series', 'soft-core', 'porn.So', 'short', 'OK', 'think', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'books', 'more', 'are', 'funnier', 'more', 'exciting', 'more', 'interesting', 'HBO', 'series']",True Blood: Season 1

However, once in a blue moon, you find a book-to-film translation, that while different from the book, isn't... horrid.  That's HBO's True Blood.If you're a fan of Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse novels, you'll find familiarity with all of the characters, basic storyline, and location.  However almost immediately the series starts to wander off of Harris' world and into its own.  The plots seem very familiar but foreign at the same time - at which point you start to judge True Blood as a series, not as a book-to-TV translation.As a series True Blood keeps you watching, but it definitely had some stumbling blocks that it had to overcome.  There is a lot of focus on drug addiction-type issues (Jason on Vamp blood) which felt very prolonged and tacked on.  Meanwhile the Vampires really seemed to be used as a plot device rather than focus - if something goes wrong, you blame ""the vampires,"" if someone gets messed up, you blame ""the vampires"".  I felt very little connection to each individual vampire (Bill, Eric, etc) as the more mundane ""human"" problems were taking center stage.  In this way, much of True Blood felt like a gritty version of a soap opera - just one that happened to have supernatural creatures in it.That being said, the non-vampires in the series really grew on you - mostly because they actually had a chance to explore their characters.  Anna Paquin (who as most people have stated, seemed to make an odd choice as Sookie - which seemed to be patterned, physically at least, on more of a Pamela Anderson type) does well as the naive Sookie who quickly gets a whole lot of ""life"" dumped into her lap.  Rutina Wesley as Tara Thornton and Nelsan Ellis as Lafayette Reynolds made an even stronger impression on me than their counterparts in the book series.  Unfortunately Sam Trammell as Sam Merlotte and Ryan Kwanten as Jason Stackhouse both felt very one-dimensional to me - Sam was a one-note ""Shucks, why doesn't Sookie like me?"" puppy dog, and Jason as a sex-crazed, drug addict (well.. I guess he really was this in the first book - the sex part at least).All in all, True Blood isn't a bad series and it sits pretty high in the ""mediocre"" side of the bar, but I'm really hoping it unfolds its wings in season two and develops into a great series.",3,Sookie - HBO's scriptwriters versus Charlaine Harris,1245628800,"06 22, 2009",2009,2408,"['Whenever', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'based', 'favorite', 'book', 'series', 'books', 'usually', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'disappointed', 'right', 'However', 'once', 'blue', 'moon', 'find', 'book-to-film', 'translation', 'while', 'different', 'book', ""n't"", 'horrid', 'HBO', 'True', 'Blood.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Charlaine', 'Harris', 'Sookie', 'Stackhouse', 'novels', ""'ll"", 'find', 'familiarity', 'characters', 'basic', 'storyline', 'location', 'However', 'almost', 'immediately', 'series', 'wander', 'Harris', 'world', 'own', 'plots', 'seem', 'very', 'familiar', 'foreign', 'same', 'time', 'point', 'start', 'judge', 'True', 'Blood', 'series', 'not', 'book-to-TV', 'translation.As', 'series', 'True', 'Blood', 'watching', 'definitely', 'had', 'stumbling', 'blocks', 'had', 'overcome', 'lot', 'focus', 'drug', 'addiction-type', 'issues', 'Jason', 'Vamp', 'blood', 'felt', 'very', 'prolonged', 'tacked', 'Meanwhile', 'Vampires', 'really', 'seemed', 'be', 'used', 'plot', 'device', 'rather', 'focus', 'something', 'wrong', 'blame', 'vampires', 'someone', 'messed', 'up', 'blame', 'vampires', 'felt', 'very', 'little', 'connection', 'individual', 'vampire', 'Bill', 'Eric', 'etc', 'more', 'mundane', 'human', 'problems', 'were', 'taking', 'center', 'stage', 'way', 'much', 'True', 'Blood', 'felt', 'gritty', 'version', 'soap', 'opera', 'just', 'one', 'happened', 'have', 'supernatural', 'creatures', 'it.That', 'being', 'said', 'non-vampires', 'series', 'really', 'grew', 'mostly', 'actually', 'had', 'chance', 'explore', 'characters', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'who', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'stated', 'seemed', 'make', 'odd', 'choice', 'Sookie', 'seemed', 'be', 'patterned', 'physically', 'least', 'more', 'Pamela', 'Anderson', 'type', 'well', 'naive', 'Sookie', 'who', 'quickly', 'whole', 'lot', 'life', 'dumped', 'lap', 'Rutina', 'Wesley', 'Tara', 'Thornton', 'Nelsan', 'Ellis', 'Lafayette', 'Reynolds', 'made', 'even', 'stronger', 'impression', 'counterparts', 'book', 'series', 'Unfortunately', 'Sam', 'Trammell', 'Sam', 'Merlotte', 'Ryan', 'Kwanten', 'Jason', 'Stackhouse', 'felt', 'very', 'one-dimensional', 'Sam', 'was', 'one-note', 'Shucks', 'why', ""n't"", 'Sookie', 'puppy', 'dog', 'Jason', 'sex-crazed', 'drug', 'addict', 'well..', 'guess', 'really', 'was', 'first', 'book', 'sex', 'part', 'least', '.All', 'True', 'Blood', ""n't"", 'bad', 'series', 'pretty', 'high', 'mediocre', 'side', 'bar', ""'m"", 'really', 'hoping', 'wings', 'season', 'two', 'great', 'series']",True Blood: Season 1

1189307,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B001FB4W0W,Terry Mesnard,"[3, 5]","2008 was an interesting year for vampire stories.  Three wildly divergent takes on the vampire mythos came out in that year and, coincidentally, all three touched on love in some capacity.  Twilight with its tween-take on a vampire love story on one (to me, abysmal) end, the brilliant Let the Right One In with its mature look at love, isolation and vampires on the other.  Somewhere in the middle lies True Blood, an unapologetic romance, wrapped in a murder mystery and sprinkled with socio-commentary.Based on the Sookie Stackhouse novels by Charlaine Harris, True Blood's first season was a delightful mix of fantasy, blood and sex that stayed true to the overall story Harris wrote, but added in some usually much needed depth.  Sookie works as a waitress in a bar and has the curse/gift of being able to read minds.  One day, a vampire named Bill enters Merlotte's, the bar, and Sookie finds herself attracted to him as he does to her.  At the same time, someone is killing women in Sookie's town and as the clues start pointing to Sookie's man whore of a brother Jason, she starts to investigate.The biggest difference between the show and the book lies in Alan Ball's (Six Feet Under, American Beauty) take on the subject.  Because the narrative in the book is first person, there's a lot of side stories and information surrounding the other characters that's never brought up.  True Blood attempts to flesh out the other characters, provide them with their own subplots and give them all more screen time.For the most part this works well, though there are some sub stories that felt boring and uninspired.  I got so tired of the mid season possession/not possession story involving Tara that I just wanted the season to progress.  At times, it felt as if the meat of the story wasn't enough to fill an entire season, leaving the writers to try to prolong some twists and plot points by adding padding.  And some of the padding feels more important by the end of the season (like Tara's aforementioned problems) when there is a payoff.  But during the season, I continually thought ""okay, where are we going with this?"" while looking at the clock.Even through the sometimes annoying moments, what kept me watching week after week were the characters and the actors that played them.  Whether it's Anna Paquin's strong take on Sookie or Rutina Wesley's pitch perfect Tara or Ryan Kwanten's hilarious Jason, the actors make the characters their own and they are always interesting to watch, even when the plot drags mid season.Ultimately, Alan Ball and his team of writers pulled it off and True Blood made me excited for the second season (starting June 14th).  It's a fun and funny, gory and sexy vampire story that was made better by the characters and actors.  I personally can't wait for season two to begin and I think Alan Ball has a hit here.Oh and in True Blood?

I never read the books, but plan on it, knowing it's different from the series a bit, according to other reviewers.This show hasn't been released on DVD yet, and people have been reviewing it since the first episode. I've seen them all, especially the 12th one, and am very excited about what's been going on. Alan Ball has another hit on his hands. I have no doubt that the DVD release will have tons of goodies for fans.My only gripe is with the cliffhanger at the end...why do that? CSI did it (as I'm sure many other shows have), andDeadwooddid it too (to be fair, Deadwood was cancelled after the 3rd Season, and a shame too!)! You make people crawl the walls in suspence and then leave them hanging there. I'm sorry, Alan. I blame you for this since you wrote & directed the last episode.Overall, though, it's a really great show that adds a new flavor to the vampire world, something I haven't seen before.

As are all of the other characters in this series, the mystery involved in finding out who is really ""what"" is entwined with a mind holding story that truly brings the books to life.This series may be too risque for many, especially smaller children so it should be previewed before showing it at the family reunion.

1189314,A96JD9312DHWC,B001FB4W0W,"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S""","[1, 2]","Vampires have come out of the coffin and are asking for rights just like everyone else. This sparks one heck of a debate, but vampires are eventually seen as citizens and are given protection under the law. Enter Bill Compton into the fray, the first vampire that the town knows of) to reach a small town in the middle of Louisiana. This sparks quite a bit of anger amongst the people living here, and the protests grow louder as bodies begin to appear with fang marks on their necks. Even more complex are the things shared between Bill and one of the people living in town, who happens to reads minds and finds Bill refreshing because she can't read his. Add to this the fact that Sam, our local bar owner, isn't exactly what we think he is, that one of our cast is something other than the sweet person he appears to be, and that vampire bars seem to be kickin' hang-outs that humans seem to be dying to get into and you have yourself the tip of one gargantuan iceberg. And these little snippets are just small samples of a much bigger puzzle playing out in the Bayou.Of all of the things I have seen on True Blood, the backstory on Bill Compton is the one thing that intrigues me the most. In one of the issues he is asked to give a lecture about the town and what the Civil War period was like, and he tells us so much about himself and that world. He holds out some things, like the story of a soldier that meets his maker, but that also makes for great reading and great drama all around. Combined with that is the way the killings work their way into a story that is not really focused on them, how other things exist besides vampires, what rules apply to them and what rules apply to Christopher Lee, and you have yourself one beautiful paintbrush swirling out the colors of a story. I have to say that I became addicted to the show rather quickly, not really thinking it would be my flavor but finding that it was indeed something that I loved, and that everything from the song in the beginning to the little things hidden in each episode seem to call to me. I have even gotten in the habit of watching it more than twice, and that is because this isn't some disposable commodity. It has the ambiance that can be lovely and can be horrific, a nice way of getting vampires into a story that does not pollute the idea of what a vampire is, and it adds in a dimension to the new vampire shows by having rough edges that are fanged and not afraid to bite. i like this because I like to have the human element and the political reaction of a large stage and the small stage, and i like how things that happen in this season ripple through the storyline later. It is good stuff and it is hard not to become a fan of.If you find vampires appealing, this is obviously for you. The less obvious fans of the show would be people who enjoy political thrillers and even romantic settings, because this has all of that and a little bit more. Hearing Bill talk about love and how someone has touched him after so long is a beautiful thing, and seeing how horrible people are when he comes into town reminds one of what types of monsters really walk around. They don't have to be confined to the night or drink blood, either, or drink synthetic Tru Blood drinks (seeing as how i would be leaving out some vampires like Bill). All in all this is more than just a story with vampires trying to gain a foothold in the society we see, allowing one entry through doors that have been barred and secrets that have been buried. I love the show - i love it a lot - and I know many people would love it if they give it a chance. It isn't without a message or too preachy, isn't the romantic stories we have seen lately and yet it has love, and it isn't all fangs but it still has its bite. give it a chance - daylight isn't all its cracked up to be.",5,Loving you is like Loving the Dead - only leagal,1257724800,"11 9, 2009",2009,3836,"['Vampires', 'have', 'come', 'coffin', 'are', 'asking', 'rights', 'just', 'everyone', 'else', 'one', 'heck', 'debate', 'vampires', 'are', 'eventually', 'seen', 'citizens', 'are', 'given', 'protection', 'law', 'Enter', 'Bill', 'Compton', 'fray', 'first', 'vampire', 'town', 'knows', 'reach', 'small', 'town', 'middle', 'Louisiana', 'quite', 'bit', 'anger', 'people', 'living', 'here', 'protests', 'grow', 'louder', 'bodies', 'begin', 'appear', 'fang', 'marks', 'necks', 'Even', 'more', 'complex', 'are', 'things', 'shared', 'Bill', 'one', 'people', 'living', 'town', 'who', 'reads', 'minds', 'finds', 'Bill', 'refreshing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'read', 'Add', 'fact', 'Sam', 'local', 'bar', 'owner', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'what', 'think', 'one', 'cast', 'something', 'other', 'sweet', 'person', 'be', 'vampire', 'bars', 'seem', 'be', 'kickin', 'hang-outs', 'humans', 'seem', 'be', 'dying', 'get', 'have', 'tip', 'one', 'gargantuan', 'iceberg', 'little', 'snippets', 'are', 'just', 'small', 'samples', 'much', 'bigger', 'puzzle', 'playing', 'out', 'Bayou.Of', 'things', 'have', 'seen', 'True', 'Blood', 'backstory', 'Bill', 'Compton', 'one', 'thing', 'most', 'one', 'issues', 'asked', 'give', 'lecture', 'town', 'what', 'Civil', 'War', 'period', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'world', 'out', 'things', 'story', 'soldier', 'maker', 'also', 'great', 'reading', 'great', 'drama', 'around', 'Combined', 'way', 'killings', 'work', 'way', 'story', 'not', 'really', 'focused', 'how', 'other', 'things', 'exist', 'vampires', 'what', 'rules', 'apply', 'what', 'rules', 'apply', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'have', 'one', 'beautiful', 'paintbrush', 'swirling', 'out', 'colors', 'story', 'have', 'say', 'became', 'addicted', 'show', 'rather', 'quickly', 'not', 'really', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'flavor', 'finding', 'was', 'indeed', 'something', 'loved', 'everything', 'song', 'beginning', 'little', 'things', 'hidden', 'episode', 'seem', 'call', 'have', 'even', 'gotten', 'habit', 'watching', 'more', 'twice', ""n't"", 'disposable', 'commodity', 'ambiance', 'can', 'be', 'lovely', 'can', 'be', 'horrific', 'nice', 'way', 'getting', 'vampires', 'story', 'not', 'pollute', 'idea', 'what', 'vampire', 'dimension', 'new', 'vampire', 'shows', 'having', 'rough', 'edges', 'are', 'fanged', 'not', 'afraid', 'bite', 'i', 'like', 'have', 'human', 'element', 'political', 'reaction', 'large', 'stage', 'small', 'stage', 'i', 'how', 'things', 'happen', 'season', 'ripple', 'storyline', 'later', 'good', 'stuff', 'hard', 'not', 'become', 'fan', 'find', 'vampires', 'appealing', 'obviously', 'less', 'obvious', 'fans', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'political', 'thrillers', 'even', 'romantic', 'settings', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'Hearing', 'Bill', 'talk', 'love', 'how', 'someone', 'touched', 'so', 'long', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'seeing', 'how', 'horrible', 'people', 'are', 'when', 'town', 'one', 'what', 'types', 'monsters', 'really', 'walk', 'around', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'confined', 'night', 'drink', 'blood', 'either', 'drink', 'synthetic', 'Tru', 'Blood', 'drinks', 'seeing', 'how', 'i', 'would', 'be', 'leaving', 'out', 'vampires', 'Bill', 'more', 'just', 'story', 'vampires', 'trying', 'gain', 'foothold', 'society', 'see', 'allowing', 'one', 'entry', 'doors', 'have', 'been', 'barred', 'secrets', 'have', 'been', 'buried', 'love', 'show', 'i', 'love', 'lot', 'know', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'love', 'give', 'chance', ""n't"", 'message', 'too', 'preachy', ""n't"", 'romantic', 'stories', 'have', 'seen', 'lately', 'yet', 'love', ""n't"", 'all', 'fangs', 'still', 'bite', 'give', 'chance', 'daylight', ""n't"", 'cracked', 'up', 'be']",True Blood: Season 1
1189315,A1XOQOW2HJSOIV,B001FB4W0W,"Trekkintheplains ""Take a sad song and make it...","[5, 8]","I have read all of these books and really enjoyed them, especially the first 4 or 5.  I recently started a re-read and after having watched the first season of this show, I just have to note how disappointed I am!  I know the novel series is no great body of literature by any means (the term ""brain-candy"" comes to mind) but it was certainly smarter than this show!WARNING: If you have not read the books or seen this series, this review is filled with spoilers.First of all, Anna Paquin is NO Sookie.  Her expressions and mode of speech (no, I don't mean the obviously faked accent) are not indicative of innate intelligence.  Just the opposite.  While Sookie had never been to college or had any form of higher education, she was smart.  To escape the bombardment of peoples's minds, she spent a lot of time reading and ""storing up"" information for future contemplation.  This Sookie doesn't show any of this.  She's extraordinarily blunt, simple, snappy, has a bad attitude, and is way way way overly dramatic.Secondly, what is with Bill?!  He's supposed to be a Southern gentleman, not a creepy, Ted Bundy-ish flu sufferer!  He's so much colder and withdrawn than the Bill I remember from the books.  That Bill dressed modernly, didn't prefer dark clothing, and was always clean-shaven.  He was respectful and protective, if a bit dense at times.  I could NEVER be comfortable with this Bill.  And he's NOT the one who staked Long Shadow!  Eric did!  And NO penalty was ever shown, let alone a sentence of making a fundamentalist Christian girl into a vampire.  And there is NO such thing as a vampire trial in a junkyard.  Come on, that's totally out of keeping with the feel and intention of the book!  Another gripe - Bill never asked Sam to look after Sookie.  He brought in ""Bubba"" to stay in the woods when he went to get his investigator position, NOT to be punished by a vampire court in a scrapyard...ugh!Sookie's grandmother - she was a well-kept, proper Southern lady who took pride in her house.  She was a tiny, slender, well-spoken woman.  She was NOT meant to be a dumpy, unkempt, loopy, slovenly dingbat!  Sookie DOES NOT clean her blood after she's murdered, her grandmother's friends do that.Jason is even more sex-crazed than in the books.  Come to think of it, there is nothing really sexy about the sex in this series.  It's unnecessarily gratuitous, vulgar, filthy, and prevalent.  I love romantic interaction and great, well-orchestrated sex scenes.  These are just gross.  There's nothing there to pique my interest.  Why do men like women to wear lingerie?  Part of the fun is what they can't see, and what they imagine and anticipate.  AND, where the HELL did Amy the psychotic hippy come from?  Jason had dated an Amy Burley who was killed, but she was barely mentioned as a possible replacement at Merlotte's for Dawn Green.  Jason didn't shack up with her and kidnap a vampire they later stake!  Jason never tried V.  He wasn't a drug user of ANY sort.Lafayette was a minor character.  He was flamboyant and comfortable with himself, and he liked wild parties, but he wasn't violent and deeply enmeshed in various, underground ways of making money.  V was a minor part of the book.  No one was dealing it except the Rattrays, and no one was taking it.  Drugs were a minor part of the book.Eric is unattractive and nothing like a Viking.  His accent is nothing like what an ancient Viking would have sounded like.  He sounds more like a putzy neanderthal.  Plus, he was MUCH more concerned about Sookie in the book than in this show, if for no other reason than he's intrigued by her and needs her psychic abilities.  And Pam is WAY too old!  She's supposed to look like a perky cheerleader and be a ruthless, yet wry, vamp.Where the HELL did Tara come from?  I know Sookie had a friend named Tara who ran Tara's Togs the clothing shop.  She's also a minor character.  Did they decide they just needed someone sassy to the point of *ANNOYING* to spice up an already well-beyond-the-most-extreme-of-Indian-cooking-seasonings-out-there style show?  And WHAT is with the back-woods fake exorcisms and the alcoholic, demonic mother?  This is just WAY out there, even for the book series.Sam should be strawberry blond, a WHOLE lot sweeter and more supportive of Sookie, and genuine competion for Bill.  Sam is attractive, alluring, mysterious, and kind.  He's a good boss, he's patient, and he is NOT violent and creepy!  When he goes home with Sookie, she wakes up the next morning to find him in bed, but she doesn't freak out.  She's always interested in Sam, and they have a good relationship.  Plus, he helps her to clean her house the day she's afraid Bill was burned in the vampire nest.  He's there to support and help her.  When Bill rises that night from the graveyard, Sookie is looking for him, not there to drop flowers on his grave, believing he's dead.Andy Bellefleur isn't so openly antagonistic.  He certainly isn't trying to keep Jason in jail after they find Rene is the killer!  He's a good cop trying to do his job, he is just paranoid about anything supernatural.Rene does not attack Sookie in the bar.  She never gets in a car with him.  In the books, he comes to her house, they run through the woods and the graveyard, and she stabs him after he has inflicted various injuries on her.  Sam doesn't save her, Bill DOES NOT rise in the SUNLIGHT to try to help!!!  She takes care of herself in the books, thank you very much.  She realizes he murdered his sister from his thoughts alone, there is NO investigation of a mystery woman she sees in his head a few days before!Bon Temps is supposed to be way more homey.  It's like people from New York got together and said ""what is your impression of small-town Louisiana?"" and decided it should be dirty, whory, violent, and suspicious.  These people can be vicious and cruel, but some a genuinely nice.  No one in the show is actually a nice person!And the Maenad with the razorback hog is in the SECOND book!  She wants tribute from Eric.  She DOES NOT know Sam, she only makes direct contact with Sookie, and she is not in the habit of appearing as a social worker to take in people who have gone astray!  WHERE did all this junk come from???I know this would be hard, if not impossible to set up, but I missed ""Bubba.""  That's a part of the book I really got a kick out of.  I wanted to see ""the man from Memphis"" in his very bittersweet new ""life.""  And I wanted to see J.B. du Rone too.  Come on, couldn't they find anyone attractive enough who could act that sweet?So many scenes and events from the book are played up to the level of ridiculousness to try to get more of a reaction from the audience.  And shouldn't the show have been produced because people admired the written series?  Ok, so why then do the producers, writers, etc. think they have to throw in SO much extra drama and conflict and so many events that were never even hinted at in the book?!  Have the people of HBO ever, EVER heard of overdoing it?  If not, I refer them back to their own show.  Can they throw any more f-bombs in too?  The f-bomb is the f-bomb because it has impact.  It looses a lot of *oomph* when it's used in every other sentence.  These people are all so violent!  They fly off the handle over EVERYTHING.  Who acts like that, really?  These books were not about sex, drugs, and violence.I just can't relate to any of these people.  I could see things to understand in each person in the series.  I could sympathize, I saw their deeper, nobler sides.  Of course there was violence, depravity, and cruelty, but this show just takes it beyond the limits.  I was told at University while working towards my English major something along these lines: one can write the impossible and get away with it, but not the improbable.I was so excited about this show.  I couldn't wait to watch a series of books I had enjoyed come across my t.v. screen.  I know movies and television can never do literature justice, but this falls well below my standards.  I am terribly disappointed that the world Charlaine Harris's writing built in my head was tainted by watching these.",2,"Overdone, overacted...over it!",1263254400,"01 12, 2010",2010,8161,"['have',

1189332,A188NTJ5LV8LA4,B001FB4W0W,Wm19,"[2, 4]","I've been reading the Southern Vampire series since the first book came out.  I don't get HBO, but I read that this was the most popular HBO series since Sex & the City.  So when Season 1 came out on Blu-ray, I got it.  Season 1 is based on the first book in the series (there are now 9 books in the series).Overall, I love the tv series.  There are minor changes from the books.  The side characters get more screen time, such as Tara, Jason and Lafayette.  Tara was a wonderful, complex, tough and vulnerable best friend.  Jason was the comic relief.  Lafayette was very interesting, as he is now the cook, road crew, drug dealer, prostitute, and friend of Sookie.  Sookie had the scared/nervous grin and the same sweetness and toughness that she has in the books.  I didn't understand why the actors playing Sam and Bill were cast, but once I watched the tv series, I totally understand.  Bill was perfect - hot, a bit scary and cold, but really loving and protective of Sookie.  After watching this, forget about being Mrs. Cullen, I'll be Mrs. Compton.  It really reminded me why Sookie loved Bill in the beginning of the series.  Adele was great.  What really caught my eye was how complex and detailed each scene was.  It really made Bon Temps and Shreveport seem alive and full of individual, real characters.  Dawn, Hoyt, Rene, Arlene, Andy, Mike, Pam, they're all there.What I was really unprepared for and thought was a bit excessive: (1) There is a lot of swearing - lots of b*** and f*** from the cast.  (2) There is a lot of nudity (naked breasts, butts, back views) and vigorous sexual activity in almost every episode.  Jason is usually mostly naked in his scenes and mindlessly banging a mostly naked woman.  In the first episode alone, there is Maudette naked, her arms tied above her head to the ceiling, being violently bounced from behind by a vampire and later Jason.  Very graphic.Other than the 2 things above, I enjoyed the series so much I'd say 5 stars.",5,Amazing,1242864000,"05 21, 2009",2009,1980,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'reading', 'Southern', 'Vampire', 'series', 'first', 'book', 'came', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'HBO', 'read', 'was', 'most', 'popular', 'HBO', 'series', 'Sex', 'City', 'So', 'when', 'Season', '1', 'came', 'out', 'Blu-ray', 'got', 'Season', '1', 'based', 'first', 'book', 'series', 'are', 'now', '9', 'books', 'series', '.Overall', 'love', 'tv', 'series', 'are', 'minor', 'changes', 'books', 'side', 'characters', 'get', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'such', 'Tara', 'Jason', 'Lafayette', 'Tara', 'was', 'wonderful', 'complex', 'tough', 'vulnerable', 'best', 'friend', 'Jason', 'was', 'comic', 'relief', 'Lafayette', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'now', 'cook', 'road', 'crew', 'drug', 'dealer', 'prostitute', 'friend', 'Sookie', 'Sookie', 'had', 'scared/nervous', 'grin', 'same', 'sweetness', 'toughness', 'books', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'actors', 'playing', 'Sam', 'Bill', 'were', 'cast', 'once', 'watched', 'tv', 'series', 'totally', 'understand', 'Bill', 'was', 'perfect', 'hot', 'bit', 'scary', 'cold', 'really', 'loving', 'protective', 'Sookie', 'watching', 'forget', 'being', 'Mrs.', 'Cullen', ""'ll"", 'be', 'Mrs.', 'Compton', 'really', 'reminded', 'why', 'Sookie', 'loved', 'Bill', 'beginning', 'series', 'Adele', 'was', 'great', 'What', 'really', 'caught', 'eye', 'was', 'how', 'complex', 'detailed', 'scene', 'was', 'really', 'made', 'Bon', 'Temps', 'Shreveport', 'seem', 'alive', 'full', 'individual', 'real', 'characters', 'Dawn', 'Hoyt', 'Rene', 'Arlene', 'Andy', 'Mike', 'Pam', ""'re"", 'there.What', 'was', 'really', 'unprepared', 'thought', 'was', 'bit', 'excessive', '1', 'lot', 'swearing', 'lots', 'b***', 'f***', 'cast', '2', 'lot', 'nudity', 'naked', 'breasts', 'butts', 'back', 'views', 'vigorous', 'sexual', 'activity', 'almost', 'episode', 'Jason', 'usually', 'mostly', 'naked', 'scenes', 'mindlessly', 'banging', 'mostly', 'naked', 'woman', 'first', 'episode', 'alone', 'Maudette', 'naked', 'arms', 'tied', 'head', 'ceiling', 'being', 'violently', 'bounced', 'vampire', 'later', 'Jason', 'Very', 'graphic.Other', '2', 'things', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'so', 'much', ""'d"", 'say', '5', 'stars']",True Blood: Season 1

1189334,A3I4XJW0NJROQ2,B001FB4W0W,w.s.,"[0, 0]","In less than about four years, True Blood has managed to become a huge cultural phenomenon. I joined the bandwagon around season three and have became an absolutely obsessed fan since then. I have seen all four seasons, but watched them in a rather backwards way which has given me a different perspective than if I became a fan when this season, the first, aired.Season one is quite possibly the quietest season of all four. We are introduced to the sleepy, small town of Bon Temps, Louisiana and our colorful cast of characters (alive and undead). While my knowledge of the killer's identity from the first episode eliminated much of the suspense, I was still absolutely riveted from the first episode to the season finale. The writing in this season was superb and so much different from the lovably crazy kitchen-sink approach of the later years. It almost made me wonder if they hired different writers (which they didn't; they just introduced many new characters in the third season and had to fit in many different storylines).Due to the more singular focus, the stories have a more intense dramatic weight. This season was also the best at capturing the small-town, Southern feel of the show. The lighting is dark and grainy, the music is slow and country-fried, and everyone's up in everyone's business. Many people believe the ""prejudice"" against the vampires in this world is some sort of Civil Rights metaphor. It could be taken that way, but it's a little insulting to compare make-believe, blood-sucking creatures' bid for equality to the struggles racial minorites and gays have faced (and still do). In my opinion, I see it more as a very clever way of depicting the age old struggle of human vs. vampire, placing it in a much more modern context.All of the characters are at their best in this season; each one very sharply defined, depicted with complex layers. Anna Paquin is brilliant as Sookie. She's all at once endearing, relatable, and a bit irritating; in short a real person. There's an endearing paradox about her that one reviewer I read pointed out: the balance between her sweetness and feistiness. She's kind and sympathetic but outspoken, independent, and unwilling to suffer fools gladly. The fact that she can also read minds just makes her even more fascinating. Paquin won a Golden Globe for her performance in this season and it was well-deserved. Moyer makes a perfect contrast to her light, effervescent energy as the somber, brooding Bill. Their chemistry is most electric in this season, as their unlikely courtship provides some sizzling sexual tension (and release).All those who complain about the focus on the other characters and how that strays from the book, get over it. I, for one, am glad that Alan Ball and his creative team have the inventiveness to branch these other storylines out, as well as change some things from the book. If they didn't, it would require absolutely no creativity on their part and everything would be totally predictable.The supporting cast is superb as well. Rutina Wesley is quite possibly my favorite as Tara. I like her character best in this season. In subsequent seasons, she's more victimized. But, in this season, she's at her best and is absolute dynamite, literally as Tara is a real hothead (to an often hilarious degree). But she's also smart and a survivor. Something about her always made me root for her. Nelsan Ellis is thoroughly entertaining as Lafayette. His character is possibly the most consistent throughout the show, but (like all the other actors) I find his characterization in this season most interesting and colorful. Ryan Kwanten as the horndog with the heart of gold Jason and Sam Trammell as Sam, Sookie's unrequited love interest, also shine. It's nearly impossible to find a bad actor on this show, even in some of the smaller roles.I truly do think this is the best season out of all. The writing, acting, and storylines were all pitch perfect. The only complaint I have is the somewhat flat characterization of Eric (a very important character, who goes on to become much more layered as the show goes on). But, this was just the beginning, after all.",5,"Best Season, By Far",1330041600,"02 24, 2012",2012,4165,"['less', 'four', 'years', 'True', 'Blood', 'managed', 'become', 'huge', 'cultural', 'phenomenon', 'joined', 'bandwagon', 'season', 'three', 'have', 'became', 'absolutely', 'obsessed', 'fan', 'then', 'have', 'seen', 'four', 'seasons', 'watched', 'rather', 'backwards', 'way', 'given', 'different', 'perspective', 'became', 'fan', 'when', 'season', 'first', 'aired.Season', 'one', 'quite', 'possibly', 'quietest', 'season', 'four', 'are', 'introduced', 'sleepy', 'small', 'town', 'Bon', 'Temps', 'Louisiana', 'colorful', 'cast', 'characters', 'alive', 'undead', 'knowledge', 'killer', 'identity', 'first', 'episode', 'eliminated', 'much', 'suspense', 'was', 'still', 'absolutely', 'riveted', 'first', 'episode', 'season', 'finale', 'writing', 'season', 'was', 'superb', 'so', 'much', 'different', 'lovably', 'crazy', 'kitchen-sink', 'approach', 'later', 'years', 'almost', 'made', 'wonder', 'hired', 'different', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'introduced', 'many', 'new', 'characters', 'third', 'season', 'had', 'fit', 'many', 'different', 'storylines', '.Due', 'more', 'singular', 'focus', 'stories', 'have', 'more', 'intense', 'dramatic', 'weight', 'season', 'was', 'also', 'best', 'capturing', 'small-town', 'Southern', 'feel', 'show', 'lighting', 'dark', 'grainy', 'music', 'slow', 'country-fried', 'everyone', 'up', 'everyone', 'business', 'Many', 'people', 'believe', 'prejudice', 'vampires', 'world', 'sort', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'metaphor', 'could', 'be', 'taken', 'way', 'little', 'insulting', 'compare', 'make-believe', 'blood-sucking', 'creatures', 'bid', 'equality', 'struggles', 'racial', 'minorites', 'gays', 'have', 'faced', 'still', 'do', 'opinion', 'see', 'more', 'very', 'clever', 'way', 'depicting', 'age', 'old', 'struggle', 'human', 'vs.', 'vampire', 'placing', 'much', 'more', 'modern', 'context.All', 'characters', 'are', 'best', 'season', 'one', 'very', 'sharply', 'defined', 'depicted', 'complex', 'layers', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'brilliant', 'Sookie', 'once', 'endearing', 'relatable', 'bit', 'irritating', 'real', 'person', 'endearing', 'paradox', 'one', 'reviewer', 'read', 'pointed', 'out', 'balance', 'sweetness', 'feistiness', 'kind', 'sympathetic', 'outspoken', 'independent', 'unwilling', 'suffer', 'fools', 'gladly', 'fact', 'can', 'also', 'read', 'minds', 'just', 'even', 'more', 'fascinating', 'Paquin', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'performance', 'season', 'was', 'well-deserved', 'Moyer', 'perfect', 'contrast', 'light', 'effervescent', 'energy', 'somber', 'brooding', 'Bill', 'chemistry', 'most', 'electric', 'season', 'unlikely', 'courtship', 'sizzling', 'sexual', 'tension', 'release', 'who', 'complain', 'focus', 'other', 'characters', 'how', 'book', 'get', 'one', 'am', 'glad', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'creative', 'team', 'have', 'inventiveness', 'branch', 'other', 'storylines', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'change', 'things', 'book', 'did', ""n't"", 'would', 'require', 'absolutely', 'creativity', 'part', 'everything', 'would', 'be', 'totally', 'predictable.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'superb', 'as', 'well', 'Rutina', 'Wesley', 'quite', 'possibly', 'favorite', 'Tara', 'character', 'best', 'season', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'more', 'victimized', 'season', 'best', 'absolute', 'dynamite', 'literally', 'Tara', 'real', 'hothead', 'often', 'hilarious', 'degree', 'also', 'smart', 'survivor', 'Something', 'always', 'made', 'root', 'Nelsan', 'Ellis', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'Lafayette', 'character', 'possibly', 'most', 'consistent', 'show', 'other', 'actors', 'find', 'characterization', 'season', 'most', 'interesting', 'colorful', 'Ryan', 'Kwanten', 'horndog', 'heart', 'gold', 'Jason', 'Sam', 'Trammell', 'Sam', 'Sookie', 'unrequited', 'love', 'interest', 'also', 'shine', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'find', 'bad', 'actor', 'show', 'even', 'smaller', 'roles.I', 'truly', 'do', 'think', 'best', 'season', 'writing', 'acting', 'storylines', 'were', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'somewhat', 'flat', 'characterization', 'Eric', 'very', 'important', 'character', 'who', 'become', 'much', 'more', 'layered', 'show', 'was', 'just', 'beginning']",True Blood: Season 1
1189335,A2W2E6BPPYZO0T,B001FB4W0W,YA book lover,"[9, 12]","I am one of those people who read and loved Charlaine Harris's books before watching the show. After hearing True Blood's rave reviews, I was excited to see it when it came out on DVD. Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations.Let me start with the positives. The show creators did mostly good casting job. Actors playing Bill, Pam, Arlene, Sam, and even Sookie delivered great performances and looked pretty much like I imagined them. I enjoyed seeing some of my favorite scenes come to life - trips to Fangtasia, Sookie's and Bill's meeting at Merlotte's, etc. Some moments created by writers (for instance, a flashback into Bill's past) were very interesting too.On the other side, it was painful to see what had become of Charlaine's world in this acclaimed TV series. Somehow small Louisiana town of Bon Temps came of as a ""nest"" of sex-crazed low-lives.  Jason instead of a charming womanizer was portrayed as a stupid drug-obsessed man whore, Bill became way too sullen and even violent, Sookie appeared to be a halfwit. I missed chemistry and love between Sookie and Bill. Their relationship unfortunately looked like the one between a fangbanger and a user-vampire. Also, was it necessary to fill the series with so much sex? I am no prude, but I do not think Jason's weekly sexcapades added anything to the story. Made-up side story lines of perpetually whining Tara and male prostitute and drug-dealer Lafayette also only added to the general air of nastiness of the fantasy universe created in the series.In spite of all these negatives, I will still check out season two. Maybe the series will finally take a right direction, lighten up on gratuitous sex and concentrate more on the great material provided by Charlaine Harris.",3,What happened to the characters?,1243209600,"05 25, 2009",2009,1751,"['am', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'read', 'loved', 'Charlaine', 'Harris', 'books', 'watching', 'show', 'hearing', 'True', 'Blood', 'rave', 'reviews', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'Unfortunately', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'expectations.Let', 'start', 'positives', 'show', 'creators', 'did', 'mostly', 'good', 'casting', 'job', 'Actors', 'playing', 'Bill', 'Pam', 'Arlene', 'Sam', 'even', 'Sookie', 'delivered', 'great', 'performances', 'looked', 'pretty', 'much', 'imagined', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'come', 'life', 'trips', 'Fangtasia', 'Sookie', 'Bill', 'meeting', 'Merlotte', 'etc', 'moments', 'created', 'writers', 'instance', 'flashback', 'Bill', 'past', 'were', 'very', 'interesting', 'too.On', 'other', 'side', 'was', 'painful', 'see', 'what', 'had', 'become', 'Charlaine', 'world', 'acclaimed', 'TV', 'series', 'Somehow', 'small', 'Louisiana', 'town', 'Bon', 'Temps', 'came', 'nest', 'sex-crazed', 'low-lives', 'Jason', 'instead', 'charming', 'womanizer', 'was', 'portrayed', 'stupid', 'drug-obsessed', 'man', 'whore', 'Bill', 'became', 'way', 'too', 'sullen', 'even', 'violent', 'Sookie', 'appeared', 'be', 'halfwit', 'missed', 'chemistry', 'love', 'Sookie', 'Bill', 'relationship', 'unfortunately', 'looked', 'one', 'fangbanger', 'user-vampire', 'Also', 'was', 'necessary', 'fill', 'series', 'so', 'much', 'sex', 'am', 'prude', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'Jason', 'weekly', 'sexcapades', 'added', 'anything', 'story', 'Made-up', 'side', 'story', 'lines', 'perpetually', 'whining', 'Tara', 'male', 'prostitute', 'drug-dealer', 'Lafayette', 'also', 'only', 'added', 'general', 'air', 'nastiness', 'fantasy', 'universe', 'created', 'series.In', 'spite', 'negatives', 'will', 'still', 'check', 'out', 'season', 'two', 'Maybe', 'series', 'will', 'finally', 'take', 'right', 'direction', 'up', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'concentrate', 'more', 'great', 'material', 'provided', 'Charlaine', 'Harris']",True Blood: Season 1
1189336,A2T8AS1JCRID98,B001FB4W0W,Yisel,"[9, 12]","I knew about the Sookie Stackhouse books thanks to the buzz about this HBO series. Since I don't have the channel, I decided to buy it on DVD and I bought the books to read them first and I can tell that was a wise decision. I became a big fan of the books, I read them all in 2 weeks and then I watched the series on DVD and one thing I can tell for sure...I'll be buying and reading the future books but I won't be following the other seasons of the series because I'm very disappointed at the many changes they made to the original story.I understand that when you translate a book to a movie or a TV series some things need to be changed, but in this case the changes where so significant that by the final chapters it was a whole different story, an inconsistent one.  A lot of time is spent in some unattractive secondary characters (AKA Jason) and some nice characters of the books (AKA Bubba) are left out entirely and the main story of Bill and Sookie is so short and awkward that I did not feel for a moment the intensity it is supposed to have.I don't want to write a long review about how the book is so different and better, but I do want to say that even if you forget the book and follow the story as it is portrayed in the TV series you find a lot of inconsistencies and flaws. I don't understand why Sookie complains about Bill leaving for the vampire politics when she knows he left to a trial for killing Long Shadow and save her life...she should be concerned about his fate..about the punishment he would face for doing that...since in the book Eric is the one that kills the vampire and faces the punishment without Sookie knowing and Bill in fact left to attend the Vampire elections in New Orleans...it will be understandable that she would be mad and she isn't.  Vampires are proud creatures, at a point in the books Bill confesses that at the beginning he thought it was degrading to have a relationship with a human...vampires and weres don't get along very well either, so the last thing a proud vampire like Bill will do is to ask Sam to protect Sookie...in the book he hires Bubba to protect her (another vampire) and never asks Sam a favor like in the TV series.I don't like the actress that interprets Sookie...physically she doesn't look like Sookie and also I feel like she's overdoing it all the time..at some point I figured if her head would fall to the ground for the way she moves it all the time. I don't see the emotions in her eyes...Sookie is sharp, strong and she constantly talks about how Bill helps her to control the telepathy and how she gets better at that. Sookie looks confused all the time in the series...she looks like someone that doesn't get it.I can keep going on and on....I recommend the books.... read them if you can, they are very good...but if like me you don't have HBO and want to see the series anyway, rent it, don't waste your money buying the DVD that you probably won't want to see twice",2,Disappointed,1245715200,"06 23, 2009",2009,2958,"['knew', 'Sookie', 'Stackhouse', 'books', 'thanks', 'buzz', 'HBO', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'channel', 'decided', 'buy', 'DVD', 'bought', 'books', 'read', 'first', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'wise', 'decision', 'became', 'big', 'fan', 'books', 'read', '2', 'weeks', 'then', 'watched', 'series', 'DVD', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'tell', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'be', 'buying', 'reading', 'future', 'books', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'following', 'other', 'seasons', 'series', ""'m"", 'very', 'disappointed', 'many', 'changes', 'made', 'original', 'story.I', 'understand', 'when', 'translate', 'book', 'movie', 'TV', 'series', 'things', 'need', 'be', 'changed', 'case', 'changes', 'where', 'so', 'significant', 'final', 'chapters', 'was', 'whole', 'different', 'story', 'inconsistent', 'one', 'lot', 'time', 'spent', 'unattractive', 'secondary', 'characters', 'AKA', 'Jason', 'nice', 'characters', 'books', 'AKA', 'Bubba', 'are', 'left', 'out', 'entirely', 'main', 'story', 'Bill', 'Sookie', 'so', 'short', 'awkward', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'moment', 'intensity', 'supposed', 'have.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'write', 'long', 'review', 'how', 'book', 'so', 'different', 'better', 'do', 'want', 'say', 'even', 'forget', 'book', 'follow', 'story', 'portrayed', 'TV', 'series', 'find', 'lot', 'inconsistencies', 'flaws', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Sookie', 'Bill', 'leaving', 'vampire', 'politics', 'when', 'left', 'trial', 'killing', 'Long', 'Shadow', 'save', 'life', 'should', 'be', 'concerned', 'fate..about', 'punishment', 'would', 'face', 'doing', 'book', 'Eric', 'one', 'vampire', 'punishment', 'Sookie', 'knowing', 'Bill', 'fact', 'left', 'attend', 'Vampire', 'elections', 'New', 'Orleans', 'will', 'be', 'understandable', 'would', 'be', 'mad', ""n't"", 'Vampires', 'are', 'proud', 'creatures', 'point', 'books', 'Bill', 'beginning', 'thought', 'was', 'degrading', 'have', 'relationship', 'human', 'vampires', 'weres', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'very', 'well', 'either', 'last', 'thing', 'proud', 'vampire', 'Bill', 'will', 'do', 'ask', 'Sam', 'protect', 'Sookie', 'book', 'Bubba', 'protect', 'vampire', 'never', 'Sam', 'favor', 'TV', 'series.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'actress', 'Sookie', 'physically', ""n't"", 'look', 'Sookie', 'also', 'feel', 'overdoing', 'time..at', 'point', 'figured', 'head', 'would', 'fall', 'ground', 'way', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'emotions', 'eyes', 'Sookie', 'sharp', 'strong', 'constantly', 'talks', 'how', 'Bill', 'control', 'telepathy', 'how', 'better', 'Sookie', 'confused', 'time', 'series', 'someone', ""n't"", 'get', 'it.I', 'can', 'keep', 'going', '.I', 'recommend', 'books', 'read', 'can', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'HBO', 'want', 'see', 'series', 'anyway', 'rent', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'buying', 'DVD', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'twice']",True Blood: Season 1
