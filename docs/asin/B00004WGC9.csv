Not in a so-bad-it's-good way; it's just flat-outone of the best horror films ever. Though billed as a straight-upslasher film, this one has a lot of things going on beneath the surfacethat make it rise beyond the mediocrity of the late-70's-era slashergenre. I believe this should actually be referred to as anunder-the-radar giallo gem rather than lump it in with your FreddyKreugers and Jason Vorhees and other slasher joke characters.A lot of the problem people seem to have with this movie involves thenon-reveal of who the demon is. Well, I'm about to reveal to you allthe startling answer to this question: the demon is, in fact, theDEMON. .. that's the whole point of the movie! That's who he is! He'sthe demon! He's the personification of evil. Questioning his motivationsis silly; it's obvious what he wants to do -- he wants to kill people.The movie never reveals why or where the demon came from, but does itreally matter? Let me just say that he came from Flint, Michigan and heis killing people because Pee Wee Herman drank the last Faygo; doesthat make the movie better for everyone? Anyway, what's interesting tome about this movie is the mood it creates. The movie is very dark, butit's never so dark you can't tell what's going on. It's not like thewhole movie is filmed in the woods with no light or something. Thedarkness is important to the movie and that combined with the musiccreates a mood that is rarely ever seen in horror films. The ""hero"" ofthe film, the character with ESP, is a great actor and it's even moreshocking what happens to him.The kill scenes are great, and I always took the character of the demonseriously. This film isn't played for laughs at all; yet at the sametime, it's not so ridiculously gory, brutal, and mean-spirited that youcan't have any fun watching this. Artfully shot, genuinely creepy, aperfect length, well-acted, full of surprises, great pacing, and a hotteacher running around in just her panties: honestly, what's not tolike?HIGHLY recommended.  For fans of movies like ""Bell from Hell"" and ""Don't Go in the House"".(As a side note, everyone I've ever showed this movie to has liked it. Strange.

I enjoy horror films and I'm a sucker for low grade B horror movies.  The film kept my interest enough but during each of the murder scenes I couldn't see a darn thing. The transfer of the film was decent during scenes that were filmed during the day and when there was a significant light source.  But when it was dark it was almost impossible to watch, and the killer always killed at night and in the dark.  This is a problem that seems to happen often with old horror movies from the 70s and 80s that are not transfered well.  As far a the film itself goes it was not that horrible I've seen worse.

Her mother is found (alive) bound, with a plastic bag over her head. Two months later, the girl's dad calls in a psychic army colonel (Cameron Mitchell) to investigate and do what police can't do in order to find his daughter and her abductor. The colonel gets visions of the madman and contorts his face a lot. Meanwhile, a beautiful pre-school teacher (Jennifer Holmes) keeps seeing an unknown stalker outside her classroom, and at the mall. Said stalker is, of course, THE DEMON, and has already killed a man who picked him up hitch-hiking. This guy's a real freakazoid, complete with black leather razor-blade tipped gloves (sound familiar?), rope, and plastic bags in his murder-kit. He attacks a girl in a dark alley, who's just left ""Boobs Disco"" (?!) only to be interrupted by two goofy bikers. THE DEMON clotheslines them both, leaving the girl to scream, and stand around gawking, before finally realizing she should run away. Another pair of honeys is standing outside of another disco, in another dark alley, being menaced by THE DEMON, when three blokes happen to wander out. The girls point at the weird guy, causing the three men to give chase. THE DEMON kills all three in quick fashion. Later, two boys are playing army in the woods. One falls on his back and sees the missing little girl's skeleton in a tall tree. Yep, THE DEMON is a bit disturbing. It all comes down to a final showdown at the young, pretty schoolteacher's house, where he pursues her and she spends most of the time topless. THE DEMON himself seems to have no face, wearing a mask to give him human features. He has super-human strength and desires only to kill. We get glimpses of him in his apartment, doing push-ups among a clutter of bikini-clad babe magazines. Not much to go on is it?

NO, you will not find FAST-PACED NON-STOP SLASHING AND BUCKETS OF BLOOD!!!!! (Haw!)...the one element I like most about effective 70's horror films is the RESTRAINT applied; music and lighting and ATMOSPHERE provide the chills, and the internal weakness of the protagonists' characters are made to be just as frightening (and aggravating!) as the killer himself.  It can't be passed off as just another Halloween knock-off; white-faced killer aside, the story has little else borrowed from said horror classic. Yes, the print is murky, but you sad young ones who don't remember VHS have just been spoiled! Old films (grainy as they may be) have a certain charm that only TRUE horror fans and romantics can enjoy; they can frighten us decades after their own relevance because we can remember those days or have the imagination to put ourselves in that position, and don't rely on $2 Million dollars worth of SpFX to get a good jolt!",4,Not for Those with Short Attention Spans!

I kept trying to sit through this movie 3 times but I always grew restless. So finally, I decided to fast forward until something happens. All of a sudden you see the dork on the cover of the movie chasing some girl (the lead character??) then that's it! The chase ends prematurely with no violence. Just screaming and running. That's about it, and then the movie ended. I could not believe how bad it was. I have yet to see a movie more worthless than this. Even Legally Blonde is more intellectual than this.
