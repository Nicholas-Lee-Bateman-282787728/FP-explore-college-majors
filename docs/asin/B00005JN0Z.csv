626049,AXJTNYD3UK1BP,B00005JN0Z,"1smileycat ""1smileycat""","[1, 1]","""Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen"" is based on the book by the same name by Dyana Sheldon.  Linsay Lohan plays Mary Elizabeth, or ""Lola"" as she prefers to be called.  Lola has just moved to New Jersey from New York and to a new high school, complete with the ""snob"", Carla (Megan Fox), the ""cute"" and ""nice guy"", Sam (Eli Marienthal) and the ""nobody"", Ella (Alison Pill).Carla and Lola compete for the leading lady role of ""Eliza"" in the school's upcoming musical, directed by the peculiar Miss Baggolli (Carol Kane).  Lola is obviously talented and we get to listen to her audition.  Unfortunately, we do not get to see any of the other auditions, including Carla's audition for the same role.  Lola gets the role of Eliza and is delighted to have won out over Carla!  Her happiness is shadowed however, by the news that her and Ella's favorite band, SidArthur is breaking up and doing only one more concert.SidArthur's farewell concert is being held in New York, with a lavish party afterwards.  Lola and Ella find out that Carla will be there, as her father is the band's attorney, and Lola just MUST make it!  There are plenty of calamities along the way as Lola and Ella attempt to see the concert and attend the party, without tickets or invitations!We get to see parts of the school musical and Lola on stage.  Carla gets hers and Lola shows just how gracious she can be about this.All in all a cute, but predictable movie.  Carla is portrayed as an over the top, egotistical snob, Lola is portrayed to be a drama queen (though not as well as she should have been with the name of the movie being what it is.)  I believe that teenagers will already be past enjoying what this movie has to offer.  I think it will appeal more to the pre-teens.

626051,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JN0Z,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","...much worse.To say that `Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen' mirrors it's subsequently superior proceeding film `Mean Girls' would be a simple yet obvious observation.  Both center around a young teenage girl who winds up in a new school, fitting in nicely with the nerds while trying to outwit the popular girl.  Both also star Lindsay Lohan; but what `Mean Girls' has that `Confessions...' lacks is Tina Fey, among many, many other things.`Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen' follows Lola as she moves from wonderful New York City to New Jersey where she finds herself in a school that just doesn't understand her.  She's your typical teenager who swoons over the frontman for the band Sidarthur, claiming his poetic lyrics to be the second coming of Shakespeare.  Moving to New Jersey has been difficult for her, and so she finds herself spreading lies to make her life all the more exciting in order to gain friendships with anyone, ultimately finding that Ella, the school nerd, is the only one that gets her.  Carla, the school princess, makes Lola her mortal enemy and they find themselves competing for the lead in the school play and also for the affections of a certain Stu of Sidarthur.Where `Confessions...' could have come off as a happy-go-lucky teen comedy it winds up coming off amateur and ridiculous.  The script is ludicrously unoriginal and manages to never flesh itself out to become anything more than an exaggerated sitcom episode.  We never really care about any of the characters and when it all boils down to it we have absolutely no reason to give this movie a second thought, or a first thought.The acting feels so staged and unnatural that it makes the slosh running rampant on `The Disney Channel' seem Oscar caliber.  Lohan has done this much better before (`The Parent Trap') and after (`Mean Girls') and so this offering seems like a really bad hair day for her.  Her acting is on the verge of annoying.  Worse yet though is Megan Fox who is barely able to make her character seem like anything more than a nervous pretty girl.  She's not evil, she's not even commanding.  Look at what Rachel McAdams did with Regina George in `Mean Girls'...I mean that is evil.  Alison Pill is rather bland in a thankless best friend role, and Glenne Headly (whom I still adore from `Mr. Holland's Opus') is forgettable as Lola's mother.  Carol Kane is frighteningly over-the-top and Adam Garcia is decent at best, failing to ever live up to the legend Lola paints of his Stu.In the end I can't say that `Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen' is really even passable entertainment.  I cannot justify ever watching this again, nor can I even justify my decision to watch it in the first place.  If you are over the age of ten then this should never grace your television screen.I wish that I had been smarter before I subjected myself to this mediocrity.",1,"It's like `Mean Girls', only worse...",1219622400,"08 25, 2008",2008,2877,"['much', 'worse.To', 'say', 'Confessions', 'Teenage', 'Drama', 'Queen', 'mirrors', 'subsequently', 'superior', 'proceeding', 'film', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'would', 'be', 'simple', 'yet', 'obvious', 'observation', 'center', 'young', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'up', 'new', 'school', 'fitting', 'nicely', 'nerds', 'trying', 'outwit', 'popular', 'girl', 'Both', 'also', 'star', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'what', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'Confessions', 'lacks', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'many', 'many', 'other', 'things.', 'Confessions', 'Teenage', 'Drama', 'Queen', 'Lola', 'wonderful', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'New', 'Jersey', 'where', 'school', 'just', ""n't"", 'understand', 'typical', 'teenager', 'who', 'frontman', 'band', 'Sidarthur', 'claiming', 'poetic', 'lyrics', 'be', 'second', 'coming', 'Shakespeare', 'Moving', 'New', 'Jersey', 'been', 'difficult', 'so', 'spreading', 'lies', 'make', 'life', 'more', 'exciting', 'order', 'gain', 'friendships', 'anyone', 'ultimately', 'finding', 'Ella', 'school', 'nerd', 'only', 'one', 'Carla', 'school', 'princess', 'Lola', 'mortal', 'enemy', 'find', 'competing', 'lead', 'school', 'play', 'also', 'affections', 'certain', 'Stu', 'Sidarthur.Where', 'Confessions', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'off', 'happy-go-lucky', 'teen', 'comedy', 'up', 'coming', 'off', 'amateur', 'ridiculous', 'script', 'ludicrously', 'unoriginal', 'never', 'flesh', 'out', 'become', 'anything', 'more', 'exaggerated', 'sitcom', 'episode', 'never', 'really', 'care', 'characters', 'when', 'down', 'have', 'absolutely', 'reason', 'give', 'movie', 'second', 'thought', 'first', 'thought.The', 'acting', 'feels', 'so', 'staged', 'unnatural', 'slosh', 'running', 'rampant', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'seem', 'Oscar', 'caliber', 'Lohan', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'Parent', 'Trap', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'so', 'offering', 'really', 'bad', 'hair', 'day', 'acting', 'verge', 'annoying', 'Worse', 'yet', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'who', 'barely', 'able', 'make', 'character', 'seem', 'anything', 'more', 'nervous', 'pretty', 'girl', 'not', 'evil', 'not', 'even', 'commanding', 'Look', 'what', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'did', 'Regina', 'George', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'mean', 'evil', 'Alison', 'Pill', 'rather', 'bland', 'thankless', 'best', 'friend', 'role', 'Glenne', 'Headly', 'whom', 'still', 'adore', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'Opus', 'forgettable', 'Lola', 'mother', 'Carol', 'Kane', 'frighteningly', 'over-the-top', 'Adam', 'Garcia', 'decent', 'best', 'failing', 'ever', 'live', 'up', 'legend', 'Lola', 'paints', 'Stu.In', 'end', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'Confessions', 'Teenage', 'Drama', 'Queen', 'really', 'even', 'passable', 'entertainment', 'can', 'not', 'justify', 'ever', 'watching', 'again', 'can', 'even', 'justify', 'decision', 'watch', 'first', 'place', 'are', 'age', 'ten', 'then', 'should', 'never', 'grace', 'television', 'screen.I', 'had', 'been', 'smarter', 'subjected', 'mediocrity']",N/A

My sister thought it was good, but I don't understand what she saw in it.Basically, the character is not realistic. In a movie, you want to be able to root for the main character, you want them to win. Lola just doesn't do that! She uses her dramatic personality and self-centered wants to put she and her ""friend"" in jeopardy. I must admit, I wasn't rooting for her. In fact, I wanted her parents to find her and take her home.Over all, I don't suggest this movie at all if you want to be entertained.

626059,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B00005JN0Z,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[2, 3]","Teen siren Lindsay Lohan haws certainly come a long way since exploding onto movie screens in the double role of Hallie and Annie in the 1998 big-budget remake of THE PARENT TRAP. In that movie she was a precocious 11-year old with a gangly frame and cute-as-a-button freckled face. Now she is a rising sex symbol with a great figure, fantastic singing voice and a confidence born of a string of hit movies.The past couple of years Lohan has had a series of hits from (another remake) of FREAKY FRIDAY to the dark teen comedy (a modern-day HEATHERS) with MEAN GIRLS.Although she was impressive in all of the above mentioned roles. I would venture a guess however that (with the possible exception of acting alongside herself in her first movie) this film - CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE DRAMA QUEEN - showcases her talent most effectively and gives her a real opportunity to sink her teeth into a role.New York born Lohan finally gets to appear on her ""home turf"" (somewhat) as a New Yorker with ""street smarts"" who is forced to move to suburbia in the shape of Deadwood, New Jersey.Lohan's character, the flashy, exuberant and quirky Mary (who prefers to go under the pseudonym Lola) does not fit into the perfect plastic world of suburbia. And instantly she makes an enemy of the most popular girl in school Carla (played with suitable venom by Megan Fox) and friends with the geeky nerd gal pal Ella (played by Alison Pill). Flashbacks of Buffy's friendship with Willow over Cordelia?!All is not going well for Mary (sorry Lola) and things get worst when her favorite band announces that they are splitting up. The flashy, colorful look of the picture plays up the happy Walt Disney-fied approach to filmmaking and the intercutting to visuals is strongly reminiscent of Hilary Duff's ""Lizzie McGuire"" show in its downright quirkyness.Soon Lola and Ella are on their way to New York determined to get into the farewell concert and crash the following party and show up Carla for the nasty piece of work she really is.What follows is pure zany wierdness in an ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING way.

It stars Lindsay Lohan, Allison Pill, and Oscar nominees Andy Garcia and Carol Kane. Though the chain of events has its creative times, it drags unnecessary in some scenes. The film may have been more entertaining if it wasn't overdramatized or overcomedized in those particular scenes. It seems like the writers were thinking more about the unusual personalities than the overall plot. A few add to the entertainment value wonderfully while most should have been omitted. However, the music was performed and written very well. The songs jumpstart the audiences' attention, keeping them watching for a while longer. Fans of the film &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; will be surprised with Lohan's performance. She didn't act her role as Lola nearly as well as before. In fact, half her lines were highly unconvincing. Maybe it was the director's fault because his job also could have improved. However some actors shined in the roles, namely Garcia as the rocker.

I found Mean Girls to be nearly too cliche to take (despite some bright points), and the Lindsay news I'd heard involved her standing around smoking at the scene of a car accident.So given all that and the typical-teenage-movie commercials, I was expecting Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen to be another disappointment--and it gave me little reason to think it wouldn't be, at first.  The misunderstood overdramatic teenager in a gypsy/hippie outfit was cheesy and overdone.  But that and the traditional overly-snobby in-charge-of-the-school beautiful girl were the low points.  The rest of the movie was fresh and entertaining.  Lola's artistic imagination was charming, as was the genuine respect for Stu that hid under her crush on him.  Even her ability to see Stu's drunken stupor for what it was and to chastise him for it was impressive.The male actors/characters were what really gave the movie its charm, however.  Adam Garcia was intensely likable, entertaining, and human as Stu.  I could have stood to see more of Sam (played by Eli Marienthal) and of Lola's dad (I didn't catch the character's name or the actor's name, but thought he was a cool guy).This movie really did leave me feeling good, and I'm glad I gave it a chance.",4,"Surprisingly, a genuine upper.",1104883200,"01 5, 2005",2005,1404,"['When', 'husband', 'rented', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'like', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'had', 'been', 'disappointed', 'lately', 'on-', 'offscreen', 'found', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'be', 'nearly', 'too', 'cliche', 'take', 'bright', 'points', 'Lindsay', 'news', ""'d"", 'heard', 'involved', 'standing', 'smoking', 'scene', 'car', 'accident.So', 'given', 'typical-teenage-movie', 'commercials', 'was', 'expecting', 'Confessions', 'Teenage', 'Drama', 'Queen', 'be', 'disappointment', 'gave', 'little', 'reason', 'think', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'first', 'misunderstood', 'overdramatic', 'teenager', 'gypsy/hippie', 'outfit', 'was', 'cheesy', 'overdone', 'traditional', 'overly-snobby', 'in-charge-of-the-school', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'were', 'low', 'points', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'fresh', 'entertaining', 'Lola', 'artistic', 'imagination', 'was', 'charming', 'was', 'genuine', 'respect', 'Stu', 'hid', 'crush', 'Even', 'ability', 'see', 'Stu', 'drunken', 'stupor', 'what', 'was', 'chastise', 'was', 'impressive.The', 'male', 'actors/characters', 'were', 'what', 'really', 'gave', 'movie', 'charm', 'however', 'Adam', 'Garcia', 'was', 'intensely', 'likable', 'entertaining', 'human', 'Stu', 'could', 'have', 'stood', 'see', 'more', 'Sam', 'played', 'Eli', 'Marienthal', 'Lola', 'dad', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'character', 'name', 'actor', 'name', 'thought', 'was', 'cool', 'guy', 'movie', 'really', 'did', 'leave', 'feeling', 'good', ""'m"", 'glad', 'gave', 'chance']",N/A

As a teenager I don't think many teens will like this movie or relate to it as they did with Lindsay Lohan in Freaky Friday. This movie was horrible and didn't live up to the book that bares the same name.In this movie Lohan has just been reprooted from her beloved New York City where she had hopes of becoming a star. She must now live in Delwood New Jersey with her potter mother and two younger sisters. Lohan quickly stands out in the suburban community neither being rich, or the abercrombie clones of the rest of the kids seem to be she struggles to fit in. Until she meets Allison Pill who happens to love Lohan's favorite band Sid Arthur -who Lola thinks are they are the greatest poets since shakesphere. When the school decides to have a show Lola quickly jumps at the chance to shine- and even lands herself the lead. Only the worst thing in the world happens Sid Arthur breaks up and Lola needs to go to their last concert in NYC to impress this girl in school only problem getting there, with no money and getting into the after party. Fate turns their way when they run into the lead singer- only problem he's drunk. Before they know it they wind up in a police station- and Lola's father shows up to bail them out-only problem she told everyone that he died in a motorcycle accidrnt to explain why she had a single mother. Before she knows it she has just had the incrediable night of her life and wants to tell everyone about only problem they don't believe her.This movie is a major disappointment for the teenage Lohan fans like myself and I hate to say it but Lohan does a horrible job as the eccentric character.

Her mother had decided to move the family from New York City, the center of everything, to a New Jersey suburb.  Mary just knows she will hate it.The one good thing is she can go around and introduce herself as Lola, the name she feels really fits her.  On her first day, Mary/Lola makes a best friend in Ella (Alison Pill) when they discover they both love the same band, Sid Arthur.  But Lola quickly makes an enemy as well when she auditions for the lead in the school play.  Carla (Megan Fox) has played the lead in every school play and doesn't take kindly to the competition.Then disaster strikes and Sid Arthur announces they are breaking up after one last concert in New York City.  Carla quickly announces she is going, and Lola just as quickly states the same.  Now, can she and Ella get tickets and permission to attend?  How will the play turn out?And will the viewer care?  My guess is, probably not.  The plot is paper thin and predictable.  The problem is that there isn't enough going on to make the viewer truly care about anything.And the characters don't help.  Lola lies about things other than her name for no apparent reason.  While she does see the harm that causes along the way, it didn't really feel resolved to me.  Ella is weak and wishy washy.Finally, the movie ends with highlighting several of the songs from the school musical.  While they certainly tie into the movie thematically, they serve no real purpose.There is nothing worth seeing here.  Pass right by and spend your time on a much better film.",1,Confessions?

626076,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B00005JN0Z,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[11, 12]","Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen is one of the best tween comedies to come out in years. The title is brilliant, the poster is very cute, and Lindsay Lohan does not disappoint with her acting. It's a simple story and the plot is almost nonexistant, but it is told in a unique and very clever away.Overall, I really enjoyed the film, but two things bothered me. It would have been nice for some of the lesser characters to have been fleshed out, especially Lohan's love interest, who is just not given enough to do. I couldn't understand why they liked each other or how they got together at the end. His character had no purpose and only seemed to be there to have the 'needed' love interest. Doesn't work! Also, the musical number near the end of the film seemed to come out of nowhere, and only to promote Lohan's CD. It was a cheap shot and didn't work and ALMOST, but not quite, ruined what is an otherwise top-notch entry in forgettable tween comedies.I think the reason the film ultimately succeeds is because of Lohan's character Lola (Real Name: Mary), who is very fun and likeable. Her view of life is a great one and I am sure the drama queen in all of us can relate to her exaggerated way of thinking. Lohan brings charm and sass to the role and makes her character very special. Lola is one of the most wonderful cinematic characters I have encountered and she truly made the film rise above-average.Add the always wonderful Carol Kane, Glenne Headly, Adam Garcia (Coyote Ugly), and Alison Pill (Pieces of April) to the mix, and you have a winner.

It's disappointing after the greatness of Mean Girls & Freaky Friday, and it's very similar to Lindsay's arch enemy (not including Tara Reid here) Hilary Duff's Lizzie McGuire Movie. The songs are almost exactly the same. (This role was originally offered to Hilary.) I don't understand why Hilary & Lindsay are such arch enemies, especially just over a guy - and Aaron Carter at that! Hello girls, grow up, and get a guy much older, and much sexier, who could teach you two a thing or two.What didn't I get about this movie? It's set in a high school. AGAIN. There are almost no confessions in this. Lindsay's character is not a drama queen. She's just a girl going through adolescence that likes a particular boy band and wants to be popular. She's upset when what she has to wear at a concert isn't perfect and that the whole school might hate her. Tell me a girl that isn't like that! Lindsay hasn't yet expanded her mind, and accepted other roles handed to her on a plate, that aren't Disney movies, or high school flicks. The way her chest is growing, she should be able to pass for much more than a teenager soon enough! And the fact that Lindsay has a fringe in almost every picture on the cover of this DVD, yet she only has a fringe for one scene in the whole movie! She looks really cute with a fringe, but why put her with a fringe on the cover, if she never has one? (Says she, who's still in the process of growing out her fringe, and wants it back!)If you've already seen Mean Girls, then the Plastics reappear in this, in the form of three girls who don't talk very much, and the leader (a brunette this time) just throws evil stares. Megan Fox plays a brilliant Carla, although she can't hold a candle to Regina in Mean Girls. Adam Garcia is practically unrecognisable, unless in close-up, as the idol of the main characters. Alison Pill is also great as the slightly Plain Jane, ""I can't lie to my parents"" Ella, who befriends Lola on her first day at school.The best scenes in the whole movie? Probably any scenes where Lindsay Lohan is dancing/singing, and the dance mat scene, where she competes and wins again Carla. Lindsay Lohan can sing, although I prefer her singing in Freaky Friday to the weak, Hilary Duff cast-off given to her in this. Although the video, in the extras, is pretty basic, but funky. When will we see Lindsay release an album? Probably soon. Lets face it, she can sing, dance, act, have celebrity cat fights, and deny rumours she's had certain assets enlarged. What more do you want?The characters in this are paper thin. The evil staring plastic leader Carla has nothing on Regina from Mean Girls, or Heather Chandler from Heathers, the drama director (Miss Baggoli) is awkward and flaky as Miss Baggoli and Lola's ""love interest"" is hardly shown throughout the movie, and is flat and uninteresting and hardly Mr Hot! At the beginning of the movie, he unsubtly ogles Lola from across the school grounds. She asks her new found best friend, ""Who is that?"" And Ella, ""Oh, that's Sam."" He comes over for no reason, says hello, and walks away grinning like a moron. But the question still remains who is this guy? Nothing is known about Sam except that his name is Sam, and he goes to their high school. They devote approximately two scenes to his character and his crush on Lola - neither of which succeed in winning the audience's hearts. We don't even know who this guy is!The extras are pretty dull actually! There's no trailer (NO trailer!), there's a making of, commentary, and Lindsay Lohan's music video. The making of features way too much of the director, a very scary haired Sara Sugarman.This movie is going to be ridiculed by everyone who sees it, as frankly, it's not Lindsay's best work. Hopefully in a few years, she'll deny she ever appeared in it.

Think Olsen twins and Hilary Duff; or think Elvis. What that means is that the deck is totally stacked in favor of the star, the supporting cast is just hired for supporting purposes, even if they have a lot of talent they will not be allowed to upstage the star. The plot will be boring and predictable, the movie will be bad because it is not really a movie but a star showcase.""But Lindsey Lohan movies are not like that"" you say. Even assuming that is correct, remember that ""Confessions"" was originally written for Duff, Lohan was just plugged in when Duff pulled away from Disney. Which in part explains its almost concurrent release with what at first glance appears to be an identical Lohan effort, ""Mean Girls"".But ""Confessions"" diverges a bit from both the standard star vehicle and from ""Mean Girls"" because at its core it is screenwriter Gail Parent's self-indulgent fantasy about the joys of humiliating the high school queen-bee with whom she still has issues. She did this to a lesser degree in Hilary Huff's ""Cadet Kelly"" but here she is able to carry it to an extreme that should turn on all sadistic viewers. Which is interesting in an abnormal psychology sort or way and is a far more essential element of the story than it was in ""Mean Girls"".Carla the snob is part of a long line of get-their-comeuppance movie characters like from Biff in ""Back to the Future"" and Barbara Mamabolo's character in ""Brave New Girl"". Coincidently Mamabolo plays Carla's friend Robin in ""Confessions"".It is no surprise that Megan Fox was cast as Carla. She played the same role in ""Holiday in the Sun"" (Olsen's) and ""Crimes of Fashion"". Fox has a special talent for this type of role, an almost negative charisma or chemistry that makes you instantly despise her. Unfortunately for her career, her role on ""Hope and Faith"" does not capitalize on this talent, although maybe it was a good idea for her to get away from the type casting. She is physically perfect as the totally hot rich girl we all remember from high school and she has all the mannerisms and nuances of the stereotype down as well. While we all take a guilty pleasure when we learn that our own Carla's (with their curves in all the right places) became fat and dumpy by their late 20's; we still regret that they did not get their comeuppance back in high school.But Parent and Director Sugarman seem to revel in their theme of humiliation and degradation. Everything revolves around Lola (Lohen's character) besting Carla, to the point where any segment not focused on that activity seems to be filler to get the thing up to feature length. Unfortunately Lola is difficult to like. Plus she wins every contest with Carla so by the end we became unsatisfied with the whole situation. Fox steals the movie from Lohen and while you don't exactly champion her, you do look forward to each of her scenes which are a welcome divsersion from the Elvis-like filler that features only Lohen and Alison Pill. Carla's friend Marsha (Ashley Leggat)is an equally welcome change of pace as Leggat is the one member of the ensemble with significant acting talent.When analyzed from this perspective even the ending, where Lola helps Carla out of the water, is played for its humiliation value. Now that Carla has been repeatedly beaten and degraded, Lola's action just rubs salt into the wound as she seems to be saying: ""since you are no longer a factor in our school I will do you a favor and stop tormenting you"". Which is a 180 degree different message than we got in from its clone movie-""Mean Girls"". All of this makes ""Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen"" a pretty sick puppy. Apparently those who get turned on by humiliation were this movie's target audience.Conversely, while the risk taken by incorporating this perverse psychological theme into ""Confessions"" hurt its box office relative to ""Mean Girls, that very uniqueness makes it a more important and ultimately a better film. Movie historians are likely to be kinder to it than contemporary audiences.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",3,It's All About Humiliation,1118361600,"06 10, 2005",2005,4163,"['Disney', 'Confessions', 'Teenage', 'Drama', 'Queen', 'one', 'movies', 'written', 'star', 'Think', 'Olsen', 'twins', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'think', 'Elvis', 'What', 'deck', 'totally', 'stacked', 'favor', 'star', 'supporting', 'cast', 'just', 'hired', 'supporting', 'purposes', 'even', 'have', 'lot', 'talent', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'allowed', 'upstage', 'star', 'plot', 'will', 'be', 'boring', 'predictable', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'bad', 'not', 'really', 'movie', 'star', 'showcase', 'Lindsey', 'Lohan', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'say', 'Even', 'assuming', 'correct', 'remember', 'Confessions', 'was', 'originally', 'written', 'Duff', 'Lohan', 'was', 'just', 'plugged', 'when', 'Duff', 'pulled', 'away', 'Disney', 'Which', 'part', 'almost', 'concurrent', 'release', 'what', 'first', 'glance', 'be', 'identical', 'Lohan', 'effort', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'Confessions', 'bit', 'standard', 'star', 'vehicle', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'core', 'screenwriter', 'Gail', 'Parent', 'self-indulgent', 'fantasy', 'joys', 'humiliating', 'high', 'school', 'queen-bee', 'whom', 'still', 'issues', 'did', 'lesser', 'degree', 'Hilary', 'Huff', 'Cadet', 'Kelly', 'here', 'able', 'carry', 'extreme', 'should', 'turn', 'sadistic', 'viewers', 'Which', 'interesting', 'abnormal', 'psychology', 'sort', 'way', 'far', 'more', 'essential', 'element', 'story', 'was', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'snob', 'part', 'long', 'line', 'get-their-comeuppance', 'movie', 'characters', 'Biff', 'Back', 'Future', 'Barbara', 'Mamabolo', 'character', 'Brave', 'New', 'Girl', 'Coincidently', 'Mamabolo', 'Carla', 'friend', 'Robin', 'Confessions', '.It', 'surprise', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'was', 'cast', 'Carla', 'played', 'same', 'role', 'Holiday', 'Sun', 'Olsen', 'Crimes', 'Fashion', 'Fox', 'special', 'talent', 'type', 'role', 'almost', 'negative', 'charisma', 'chemistry', 'instantly', 'despise', 'Unfortunately', 'career', 'role', 'Hope', 'Faith', 'not', 'capitalize', 'talent', 'maybe', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'get', 'away', 'type', 'casting', 'physically', 'perfect', 'totally', 'hot', 'rich', 'girl', 'remember', 'high', 'school', 'mannerisms', 'nuances', 'stereotype', 'down', 'as', 'well', 'take', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'when', 'learn', 'own', 'Carla', 'curves', 'right', 'places', 'became', 'fat', 'dumpy', 'late', '20', 'still', 'regret', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'comeuppance', 'back', 'high', 'school.But', 'Parent', 'Director', 'Sugarman', 'seem', 'revel', 'theme', 'humiliation', 'degradation', 'Everything', 'revolves', 'Lola', 'Lohen', 'character', 'besting', 'Carla', 'point', 'where', 'segment', 'not', 'focused', 'activity', 'be', 'filler', 'get', 'thing', 'up', 'feature', 'length', 'Unfortunately', 'Lola', 'difficult', 'like', 'contest', 'Carla', 'so', 'end', 'became', 'unsatisfied', 'whole', 'situation', 'Fox', 'movie', 'Lohen', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'champion', 'do', 'look', 'forward', 'scenes', 'are', 'welcome', 'divsersion', 'Elvis-like', 'filler', 'only', 'Lohen', 'Alison', 'Pill', 'Carla', 'friend', 'Marsha', 'Ashley', 'Leggat', 'equally', 'welcome', 'change', 'pace', 'Leggat', 'one', 'member', 'ensemble', 'significant', 'acting', 'talent.When', 'analyzed', 'perspective', 'even', 'ending', 'where', 'Lola', 'Carla', 'water', 'played', 'humiliation', 'value', 'Now', 'Carla', 'been', 'repeatedly', 'beaten', 'degraded', 'Lola', 'action', 'just', 'rubs', 'salt', 'wound', 'be', 'saying', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'factor', 'school', 'will', 'do', 'favor', 'stop', 'tormenting', 'Which', '180', 'degree', 'different', 'message', 'got', 'clone', 'movie-', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'Confessions', 'Teenage', 'Drama', 'Queen', 'pretty', 'sick', 'puppy', 'Apparently', 'who', 'get', 'turned', 'humiliation', 'were', 'movie', 'target', 'audience.Conversely', 'risk', 'taken', 'incorporating', 'perverse', 'psychological', 'theme', 'Confessions', 'hurt', 'box', 'office', 'relative', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'very', 'uniqueness', 'more', 'important', 'ultimately', 'better', 'film', 'Movie', 'historians', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'kinder', 'contemporary', 'audiences.Then', 'again', 'what', 'do', 'know', ""'m"", 'only', 'child']",N/A

I did not find it as bad as other reviewers in amazon.com about this movie. When you see a Disney movie with Lindsay Lohan on the poster of the movie, you should expect to see a teen movie that is unbelievable yet funny, and that is what Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen delivers.It seems like Disney is now putting Lindsay Lohan for every teenage movie that they release, which is good, because she suits the role perfectly for all of them. After acting in other movies such as `The Parent Trap', `Life-Size', `Freaky Friday' and `Mean Girls' she comes back to the big screen with `Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen'.  When I rented this movie, I never really got my hopes up high because I knew what type of a movie I was expecting to see. The story revolves around Lola (Lohan), a teenager living in New York City, who dreams of being a big actress someday. However, she feels her dreams are shattered, when she moves to the suburbs in New Jersey, with her mother and her sisters. Nevertheless, she makes friends with a girl name Ella, as well as makes rivals with the most popular girl in the new school. She makes up stories to her friends to make herself seem more interesting to fit in better. She tries competing with her rival in all the ways that she can, and ends up making a bet, which she cannot live up to. In the way, she realizes that by being truthful to herself and others, she can achieve anything and that is what really matters in the end.Lindsay Lohan plays her role really well as Lola. She is very convincing for her part and delivers perfectly. Some of the scenes in the movie are very funny, but some of them are unnecessary and could be avoided. Some of the songs in the background fit well to this movie, but most of them sound the same. True, this is not AS good as `Freaky Friday', but it is still amusing. On the whole, if you want a really serious, thought-provoking movie, then you should avoid this. However, if you want a casual, lighthearted fun teen movie, then you should rent this movie.",4,Not bad!,1094601600,"09 8, 2004",2004,2128,"['Recently', 'rented', 'Confessions', 'Teenage', 'Drama', 'Queen', 'found', 'be', 'above', 'average', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'as', 'bad', 'other', 'reviewers', 'amazon.com', 'movie', 'When', 'see', 'Disney', 'movie', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'poster', 'movie', 'should', 'expect', 'see', 'teen', 'movie', 'unbelievable', 'yet', 'funny', 'what', 'Confessions', 'Teenage', 'Drama', 'Queen', 'delivers.It', 'Disney', 'now', 'putting', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'teenage', 'movie', 'release', 'good', 'suits', 'role', 'perfectly', 'acting', 'other', 'movies', 'such', 'Parent', 'Trap', 'Life-Size', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'back', 'big', 'screen', 'Confessions', 'Teenage', 'Drama', 'Queen', 'When', 'rented', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'hopes', 'up', 'high', 'knew', 'what', 'type', 'movie', 'was', 'expecting', 'see', 'story', 'Lola', 'Lohan', 'teenager', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'who', 'being', 'big', 'actress', 'someday', 'However', 'dreams', 'are', 'shattered', 'when', 'suburbs', 'New', 'Jersey', 'mother', 'sisters', 'Nevertheless', 'friends', 'girl', 'name', 'Ella', 'as', 'well', 'rivals', 'most', 'popular', 'girl', 'new', 'school', 'up', 'stories', 'friends', 'make', 'seem', 'more', 'interesting', 'fit', 'better', 'competing', 'rival', 'ways', 'can', 'up', 'making', 'bet', 'can', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'way', 'being', 'truthful', 'herself', 'others', 'can', 'achieve', 'anything', 'what', 'really', 'matters', 'end.Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'role', 'really', 'well', 'Lola', 'very', 'convincing', 'part', 'delivers', 'perfectly', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'are', 'unnecessary', 'could', 'be', 'avoided', 'songs', 'background', 'fit', 'well', 'movie', 'most', 'sound', 'same', 'True', 'not', 'AS', 'good', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'still', 'amusing', 'whole', 'want', 'really', 'serious', 'thought-provoking', 'movie', 'then', 'should', 'avoid', 'However', 'want', 'casual', 'lighthearted', 'fun', 'teen', 'movie', 'then', 'should', 'rent', 'movie']",N/A
626088,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JN0Z,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 7]","In ""Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen"" - which hits what is surely a new low in dreadful ""Clueless"" clones - Lindsay Lohan plays a 15-year old girl who suffers what the filmmakers obviously see as a fate worse than death:  being forced to move from New York City to suburban New Jersey (from the way she carries on, one would think her mother were dragging her off to live in Iraq or Afghanistan).  Once she hits school in this alien world, the ditzy teen with dreams of becoming a serious actress makes instant enemies of the requisite Class Bitch, who does everything in her power to sabotage Lola's efforts at taking her rightful place among the snooty ""in"" crowd on campus.  Lola and her straight-as-an-arrow, plain Jane girlfriend also wreak havoc in Manhattan when they attempt to crash a party hosted by a third-rate rock'n'roll band they both idolize (ah for the days of ""The World of Henry Orient"" once again!).It's hard to convey in words just how jaw-droppingly bad this film truly is.  The writing, acting and staging all fall far below even the most minimal standards for rudimentary moviemaking, with all of the characters so ridiculous and overdrawn that they fail to rise even to the level of stereotypes.  In fact, the average high school film class production is superior to this movie in every conceivable respect.I realize that I am not exactly the target audience for this film, but I would never sell teenaged girls in this country so short by suggesting that even they would be amused by this travesty.  One element of the ""plot"" involves Lola starring as Eliza Doolittle in a preposterously bad high school musical version of ""Pygmalion.""

In the high school plot it tries to follow one similar to Mean Girls but fails miserablly. The first hour is a waste but the second half is OK.

626097,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JN0Z,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 5]","Virtually plotless, and pointless to many people except  Lindasy Lohan fans, 'Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen' is all about Lindsay Lohan, Disney's starlet who made a great success in 'Freaky Friday.'  I liked the film, and her acting too, but couldn't finally come to like this new film, which so eagerly tries to present Lohan's character as a likable one.  Sorry, but Disney's misguided idea of 'acting like a teenage drama queen' is all based on the costumes, colors, slapsticks,  and mostly self-centered character(s) and the incredible plot.Lindsay Lohan plays Mary, leaving New York City behind with her mother and sisters.  She starts a new life in the suburb, Dellwood where, she thinks, is 'Deathwood'; where she must abandon all hopes, and say good-bye to all the 'culture' of the city.  However, Mary, or 'Lola' as she prefers to be called, is so keen to be a singer/actor that she joins in the production of school drama (organized Carol Cane), modernized version of Bernard Shaw drama 'Pygmalion' set in New York.  The title goes, 'Eliza Rocks.'In the meanwhile, her favorite rock band announced that they are going to disband, and Mary and her best friend Ella (Alison Pill) decide to go the final concert.  The problem is, Mary rather rashly declares before 'the most popular girl in school' (read 'very mean high school queen') Carla (Megan Fox) that she is going to be there while she doesn't have a ticket.But can you believe this?  I can suspend my disbelief while watching films, but see, these two teenagers actually go to New York City, wearing expensive dress (stealing, or 'borrowing' the stage costume), and they seek for a scalper to get concert tickets!  I cannot write about the following events, but they are all impossible, including a little lecture about alcohol.OK.  I don't care the lame story if the film is fun.  But how can it be when everything is extremely unrealistic, and even off-putting.  For all the energy and charms of Lindsay Lohan, the heroine's personality just doesn't enchant us.  From the Day One she lies about herself when she doesn't have to simply because she wants to impress the people around her.  About her name, her daddy, etc., but when she starts to sing at the school drama's try-out, she warbles like a pro-singer, snatching the lead role.  And we are supposed to like her.  Please, Disney.  Please.Though this is a Disney film (with its castle logo), I find it very offensive.  It's curious, but perhaps that's because the film has a patronizing tone about the teenager's dreams like singing on stage or meeting rock stars.  The film, making everything silly and nonsense, treats these dreams as something really silly and meaningless -- in other words, the whole picture, with its mediocre musical sections, stereotyped characters, and the easy-going attitudes about anything about the teenagers' life, makes those dreams look like a piffle.  Of course, they are not.  But the film suggests the opposite.",1,Complete Mess Despite Lindsay Lohan's Energetic Acting,1117065600,"05 26, 2005",2005,2977,"['Virtually', 'plotless', 'pointless', 'many', 'people', 'Lindasy', 'Lohan', 'fans', ""'Confessions"", 'Teenage', 'Drama', 'Queen', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'Disney', 'starlet', 'who', 'made', 'great', 'success', ""'Freaky"", 'Friday', 'liked', 'film', 'acting', 'too', 'could', ""n't"", 'finally', 'come', 'like', 'new', 'film', 'so', 'eagerly', 'tries', 'present', 'Lohan', 'character', 'likable', 'one', 'Sorry', 'Disney', 'misguided', 'idea', ""'acting"", 'teenage', 'drama', 'queen', 'based', 'costumes', 'colors', 'slapsticks', 'mostly', 'self-centered', 'character', 's', 'incredible', 'plot.Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'Mary', 'leaving', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'mother', 'sisters', 'new', 'life', 'suburb', 'Dellwood', 'where', ""'Deathwood"", 'where', 'must', 'abandon', 'hopes', 'say', 'good-bye', ""'culture"", 'city', 'However', 'Mary', 'be', 'called', 'so', 'keen', 'be', 'singer/actor', 'production', 'school', 'drama', 'organized', 'Carol', 'Cane', 'modernized', 'version', 'Bernard', 'Shaw', 'drama', ""'Pygmalion"", 'set', 'New', 'York', 'title', 'Rocks', 'meanwhile', 'favorite', 'rock', 'band', 'announced', 'are', 'going', 'disband', 'Mary', 'best', 'friend', 'Ella', 'Alison', 'Pill', 'decide', 'go', 'final', 'concert', 'problem', 'Mary', 'rather', 'rashly', 'declares', ""'the"", 'most', 'popular', 'girl', 'school', 'read', 'mean', 'high', 'school', 'queen', 'Carla', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'going', 'be', 'there', ""n't"", 'have', 'ticket.But', 'can', 'believe', 'can', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'watching', 'films', 'see', 'two', 'teenagers', 'actually', 'go', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'wearing', 'expensive', 'dress', 'stealing', ""'borrowing"", 'stage', 'costume', 'seek', 'scalper', 'get', 'concert', 'tickets', 'can', 'not', 'write', 'following', 'events', 'are', 'impossible', 'including', 'little', 'lecture', 'alcohol.OK', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'lame', 'story', 'film', 'fun', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'when', 'everything', 'extremely', 'unrealistic', 'even', 'off-putting', 'energy', 'charms', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'heroine', 'personality', 'just', ""n't"", 'enchant', 'Day', 'One', 'when', ""n't"", 'have', 'simply', 'impress', 'people', 'name', 'daddy', 'etc.', 'when', 'sing', 'school', 'drama', 'try-out', 'pro-singer', 'snatching', 'lead', 'role', 'are', 'supposed', 'Please', 'Disney', 'Please.Though', 'Disney', 'film', 'castle', 'logo', 'find', 'very', 'offensive', 'curious', 'perhaps', 'film', 'patronizing', 'tone', 'teenager', 'dreams', 'singing', 'stage', 'meeting', 'rock', 'stars', 'film', 'making', 'everything', 'silly', 'nonsense', 'dreams', 'something', 'really', 'silly', 'meaningless', 'other', 'words', 'whole', 'picture', 'mediocre', 'musical', 'sections', 'stereotyped', 'characters', 'easy-going', 'attitudes', 'anything', 'teenagers', 'life', 'dreams', 'look', 'piffle', 'course', 'are', 'not', 'film', 'opposite']",N/A
