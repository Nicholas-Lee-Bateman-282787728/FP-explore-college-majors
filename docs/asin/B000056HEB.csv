569240,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B000056HEB,C. B Collins Jr.,"[2, 2]","I am in awe of every aspect of this film. The screenplay is almost beyond compare. The acting by Ms. Bancroft and Miss Duke was of the highest merit. The directing and cinematography were both incredible. This is one of America's great achievements in film making. I will go into detail on a few of these points:The screenplay is superb, getting to the very heart of what is the difference between love and pity, between meeting our dependency needs and encouraging the independence of other.  The struggle between Anne Sullivan and her student, Helen Keller, is only slightly more dramatic than the struggle between Anne Sullivan and Helen's parents. As a young girl with impaired visision Anne and her brother grew up in a state institution with the mentally ill and elderly, playing with the bodies in the morgue. Her brother tragically dies of TB of the pelvis, but Anne convinces the assylum directors to allow her to attend school. After 11 operations she graduates at the top of her class from the Perkins School for the Blind. The achievements of Anne Sullivan must be recognized as being as significant as the achievements of Helen Keller.Even though the film is full of insightful, piercing dialogue, it also is absolutely filled with action, so much action that it wears you out watching it. The battles between Anne Sullivan and Helen are amazing.Ms. Bancroft is super in the role of Anne Sullivan, a semi-blind young woman who is certain of her mission and realizes compassion must not overpower the instinct to foster independence and autonomy of the human spirit. Patty Duke's portrayal of Helen is sensitive and natural, never once giving the impression that she is an actress playing as a blind girl.The drama and movement are heightened by the wonderful choice of black and white with austere sets and scenes. Camera angles and closs-up shots of the characters intensify the emotional charge of the film.What a wonderful combination of exquisite storytelling this film is.

569243,A15IN5H4IATSHQ,B000056HEB,Classic film buff,"[1, 1]","This was the first and best of Anne Bancroft's own ""Triple Crown"" of Oscar nominated performances in the 1960's, followed by ""The Pumpkin Eater"" and ""The Graduate"".  For ""The Miracle Worker"" Ms. Bancroft would win the coveted Best Actress Award and it must have been a sweet vindication to her.  Hollywood had failed to recognize and utilize her blazing talent when she had a studio contract with Twentieth Century Fox in the 1950's, miscasting her in some fairly poor films.  It took a return to her native New York and two smash Broadway hits ""Two for the Seesaw"" and ""The Miracle Worker"" to show Hollywood it's mistake.  Yet even so, Shirley MacLaine was given Ms. Bancroft's part of Gittel Mosca in the film version of ""Two for the Seesaw"".  Producer Fred Coe, director Arthur Penn and author William Gibson the triumvirate responsible for both plays were determined this wouldn't happen when ""The Miracle Worker"" was filmed.  They tenaciously held out for Anne Bancroft over such preferred stars as Audrey Hepburn and Elizabeth Taylor, and were covered with glory as a result.Briefly this is the based on the true-life story of the acclaimed author and lecturer Helen Keller who as an infant in the 1880's was left blind and deaf as a result of a serious illness.  Her parents were unable to control or communicate with her and as a result she ran wild, an uneducated little savage who as she grew older was becoming increasing difficult to handle.  After seeing many doctors unsuccessfully, as a last resort the Kellers turned to the Perkins Institute for the Blind in Boston, Massachusetts.  The Institute sent Annie Sullivan a young half blind woman who was a former student to be Helen's teacher.  ""The Miracle Worker"" is primarily about Annie's arrival and her battle to break through Helen's dark universe by teaching her the alphabet for the deaf, aka sign language.  Once Helen makes the connection that the gestures Annie makes into her hand are words, the names of everything around her, a flame will flare that will light the world for her.  That Annie finally achieves this against incredible odds is the miracle.The Broadway production opened in October 1959 starring Anne Bancroft as Annie Sullivan and Patty Duke as the young Helen Keller.  It was a gratifying critical and financial success, running 719 performances, and thankfully both ladies got to repeat their roles on film.  I could raid Roget's Thesaurus for adjectives to do total justice in describing their performances but I'll settle with three, ""extraordinary"", ""brilliant"" and ""magnificent"".  Although there have been subsequent revivals on television and the theatre, including one where Ms. Duke played Annie, no one has able to touch these original performances and they remain the definitive ones.The centerpiece of the film is the battle royal at the breakfast table where Annie tries to undo the cumulative effects of many years spoiling by Helen's parents, and gets her to eat off a plate using a spoon and a napkin.  Although it's a wordless scene that goes on approximately ten minutes, it's never dull.  Rather it's astonishing and gripping in its power viewing Annie and Helen in their tempestuous skirmish as they tug and wrestle with each fiercely determined to win.  Given this was such a tumultuous, primitive scene both actresses were heavily padded to avoid injuries, yet they inevitably occurred.  However, the final result was worth it, I would have loved to see Bancroft and Duke do this on the stage it must have been mesmerizing.When Annie achieves the miracle and Helen comprehends the correlation between the sign language and the objects around her it provides a exhilarating and emotional climax to the film.  I cried the first time I saw it years ago, and I still find it so extraordinarily moving that watching it will bring tears to my eyes.As stupendous as they are as a team, I'd like to give individual curtain calls to Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke.  For me, this is Anne Bancroft's defining performance as an actress, her crowning glory, and not the glacial Mrs. Robinson in ""The Graduate"", as fine as she was.  Her Annie is in turn fierce, comic, wry, unsentimental, passionate, forthright, courageous, driven by an obsession to rescue Helen from the bleak emptiness that is her life, and a iron willed tenaciousness to make this happen.  Bancroft's Annie is a woman haunted by the early needless death of her younger brother Jimmy from poverty and neglect.  He was about Helen's age, Annie couldn't save him, but she is determined to liberate Helen from her black prison. Yet despite her tough outer shell, Ms. Bancroft reveals little glimpses and sparks of the tenderness and love within her.  She uses her voice as a marvelous instrument with a velvety trace of an Irish brogue.  I believe the real Annie Sullivan would have been honored by her portrayal.  Without the use of speech, Patty Duke had a difficult task as Helen Keller, but she does so much with her facial expressions and body language that it doesn't really matter.  She makes Helen at first a formidable foe for Annie, an ungovernable little animal with a combustible temper.  However, Ms. Duke suggests the dormant intelligence that is there, unrealized, waiting to be released.  Her metamorphosis as she bursts out of the cocoon of her ignorance when Annie finally reaches her is electrifying.  A well-deserved Best Supporting Actress Oscar acknowledged Ms. Duke's excellence.As for the rest of the cast, Inga Swenson and Victor Jory as Captain and Mrs. Keller, Andrew Prine as Helen's older half brother James, Beah Richards as the servant Viney, they all do fine work, but ultimately the film rests on Bancroft and Duke's shoulders, and theirs are the performances you will remember  long after you've viewed the movie.Both director Arthur Penn and playwright William Gibson do superb work in transferring their stage vision to a fluid cinema adaptation.  Penn knows just where to place the camera for maximum effectiveness in both the fight and miracle scenes.  One monologue of Gison's in particular that Annie addresses to Helen after all her efforts to reach Helen's mind have been fruitless and she is at wit's end has flashes of poetry, the title quote is one of the examples.Now as for extras, unfortunately except for the trailer, there aren't any.  This cries out for a commentary by Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke at the least with support by Arthur Penn and William Gibson.  Too late now, sadly Patty Duke is the sole survivor of the quartet.So to conclude I highly recommend this movie, I'd give it six stars if I could.  It is so uplifting, showing how one person can truly make a difference and cause a miracle.  This film opened in 1962, just as the feminist movement was in it's embryo stage, but it's an excellent example of sisterhood, one female helping another.  One final point of interest the term ""the miracle worker"" was coined by Mark Twain who was friends with both women and said approximately ""If Helen is the miracle, then Annie Sullivan is the miracle worker.""",5,"""I wanted to teach you, oh, everything the earth is full of, Helen, everything on it that's ours for a wink and it's gone.""",1308614400,"06 21, 2011",2011,7080,"['was',

569247,A35UNON2GI8C0R,B000056HEB,David Kusumoto,"[135, 136]","The most amazing thing about the film version of ""The Miracle Worker"" is its absolutely timeless quality.  It still holds up beautifully for a film that's more than 50 years old.I've seen ""The Miracle Worker"" probably a dozen times.  And it never gets tiring, boring or unemotional.  In fact, after each viewing, I pick up more details - and the tears still come just as they did when I first saw it many years ago.The Oscar-winning performances by Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke are shattering.  The grainy flashback and dream sequences involving Bancroft's character, Annie Sullivan, are wonderfully spooky - and the fabulously haunting score by Laurence Rosenthal adds a perfect counterbalance to ""The Miracle Worker,"" bringing emotional resonance to an otherwise purposely unsentimental telling of the Helen Keller story.  Yet while I say it's unsentimental, its ending is arguably sentimental, which is why the film's devastating last 10 minutes remain wonderful.  The film covers only the short period leading up to Helen Keller's breakthrough to others as a child of intelligence - instead of a child who's incorrectly believed to be mentally handicapped.Director Arthur Penn, who later went onto to lens his classic, ""Bonnie and Clyde (1967), did a wonderful thing translating William Gibson's play to the visual language of cinema.  There isn't a flaw I can detect with this film, especially his pans, dissolves, double exposures and grainy images with the dream sequences.  It's a remarkable portend of things to come for this director - and frankly, I enjoy ""The Miracle Worker"" a lot more than ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" an acknowledged classic that for me, is more recognized for its counter-culture storytelling style and shocking violence at the time it was released.  That ""Bonnie and Clyde"" made the American Film Institute's ""greatest 100 films ever made list"" - and the ""Miracle Worker"" did not - is the bigger shock.  If you go over the list and see some of the junky films that made it on the basis of ""name"" - instead of quality - you almost retch.Sharing the New York stage with Patty Duke in 1960, followed by the producer's insistence that Bancroft be kept as the lead for the film version of ""The Miracle Worker"" - (over bankable names like Elizabeth Taylor or Audrey Hepburn) - is the stuff Hollywood dreams are made of.  Then of course, Bancroft gets her Oscar and five years later, she lands the role that's as big to film history as Scarlett O'Hara...(Mrs. Robinson in ""The Graduate."")One scene I must comment on...it's the famously long sequence in the dining room where no more than perhaps five lines of dialogue are uttered by Bancroft.  It is relentlessly physical, a dazzling and exhausting battle of wills, so entrancing a show by Bancroft and Duke as they run around the room, spoons thrown, with every object getting trashed.  It is violence in a different form, one with an extremely productive purpose that makes it impossible to avert your eyes.  It's mesmerizing.In sum, this film is a treasure that pops up on television from time to time, but it's also a film that's worth owning in all of its widescreen glory.  The reason many people rent movies instead of buying them - is because so few - are worth watching more than once.  Well, ""The Miracle Worker"" DVD is comparable to what it costs to see a film in a theater, and there's no doubt in my mind that it should be in every person's library.Perhaps my only regret, as an Oscar buff, is that the film wasn't nominated for Best Picture.  I don't mind that ""Lawrence of Arabia"" won that year (another classic), but to see ""The Miracle Worker"" get bumped for a Best Picture nomination by the inferior Brando remake of ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" - makes me wonder, ""what were those voters thinking?""The passage of time will do that to you.  Just ask people who wonder why Judy Garland lost an Oscar in 1954 for ""A Star is Born"" - to the ""dressed down"" performance Grace Kelly gave in ""The Country Girl.""  There's no rhyme or reason for such things.  In the end, you've no choice but to take comfort knowing that awards or no awards - ""The Miracle Worker"" remains one of the greatest American films - ever made.",5,"The Miracle Worker is spectacular, wonderful and wrenching!

569248,A1FDW1SPYKB354,B000056HEB,David Von Pein,"[15, 15]","15-year-old Patty Duke and 30-year-old Anne Bancroft are simply magnificent in 1962's emotion-filled and heart-tugging drama, ""The Miracle Worker"", a film based on the true-life story of Helen Keller, who was both deaf and blind, but far from dumb.Bancroft (Anne ""Annie"" Sullivan) and Duke (Helen Keller) fight tooth-and-nail throughout a goodly portion of ""The Miracle Worker"", which is a movie which was inspired by the real Helen Keller's autobiography ""The Story Of My Life"". It was, indeed, literally a ""tooth""-and-nail battle for Miss Sullivan in parts of the movie, as she attempts to communicate with young Helen, with Annie getting a tooth knocked out of her head at one point thanks to a hearty smack across the face from her student.But through an undying combination of caring, kindness, persistence, and unwavering toughness, Annie finally gets through to Helen, and by the film's final act we can see that Annie has taught Helen more than just the meaning of the words ""water"", ""tree"", and ""key"". Annie has taught her the meaning of the word ""love"" as well -- as we see demonstrated so well and tenderly in the very last moments of this motion picture.Patty Duke's performance as Keller is so realistic and genuine, it's nothing short of awe-inspiring. Not once did I detect even the smallest sign that Patty was ""acting"" here. I would swear she was totally blind throughout this motion picture. And Miss Bancroft is every bit Patty's equal in this 106-minute film. The thick accent and that wonderful pair of ever-present dark glasses help to define the character of ""Annie"", the tough teacher, formerly blind herself, who performs the ""Miracle"" that Helen's family had never thought was possible.Both Duke and Bancroft were justifiably rewarded for their laudable work in ""Worker"", as each received a 1962 Oscar statue when that year's Academy Awards were handed out in early 1963.** = No small accomplishment either, especially in that movie year of '62, which (IMHO) was one of the top years for big-screen entertainment in the history of cinema. ""The Miracle Worker"" shared theater space that same year with such great films as: ""To Kill A Mockingbird"", ""Lawrence Of Arabia"", ""The Longest Day"", ""The Manchurian Candidate"", ""Cape Fear"", ""Mutiny On The Bounty"", ""Days Of Wine And Roses"", ""The Music Man"", ""Birdman Of Alcatraz"", ""Advise & Consent"", and ""How The West Was Won"".Bancroft beat out a pretty impressive foursome of opponents in the ""Best Actress"" category -- Katharine Hepburn, Bette Davis, Geraldine Page, and Lee Remick.While Miss Duke took ""Best Supporting Actress"" of '62 over the likes of Thelma Ritter, Mary Badham, Angela Lansbury, and Shirley Knight. Patty became the youngest person ever to take home an Oscar statue (at age 16, when she won the award).""The Miracle Worker"" made its USA premiere on the 23rd day of May back in 1962 (in New York City). The film, which debuted elsewhere in the United States on July 28, 1962, was nominated for three additional Academy Awards as well, including a nomination going to Arthur Penn for ""Best Director"" (with David Lean ultimately picking up that win for his work behind the camera of ""Lawrence Of Arabia"").For a good ""workout"" (so to speak), without having to get up out of your chair, I'd recommend viewing Chapter #7 of this DVD. That's the chapter that contains one of my favorite scenes from ""The Miracle Worker"" (and one where hardly a single word is spoken) -- that being the dining-room scene with Annie and Helen, during which Annie is, in effect, telling Helen ""You're going to eat your dinner using this spoon if it takes all damn night!"".That extraordinary scene is a 9-minute, non-stop lesson in perseverance and dogged determination, and is also a chance to watch in awe as two gifted actors display their finely-tuned craft. Patty and Anne must have been literally worn to a frazzle at the end of filming that lengthy scene. Heck, I was wrung out just watching it.Inga Swenson, Victor Jory, and Andrew Prine co-star in ""Miracle"", and all do a fine job as the supporting cast to Anne and Patty. Jory's ""Captain Keller"" seems a trifle ""over the top"" at times (maybe a tad more than a trifle actually), but his softer, caring side emerges too, making up for his scenery-chewing moments (IMO).Some of my favorite ""Miracle"" dialogue (from Miss Bancroft) -- ""Mrs. Keller, I don't think Helen's worst handicap is deafness or blindness ... I think it's your love ... and pity. All of ya here are so sorry for her, you've kept her like a pet. Why, even a dog ya housebreak!""----------------A little bit about the real Helen and Annie...........The real-life story of Helen Keller is one of the most remarkable in history. After scarlet fever rendered her blind and deaf at the age of only 19 months, Helen would eventually learn to read (in multiple languages), and she would go on to write more than a dozen books! She also learned to speak. Helen even graduated (with honors) from Radcliffe College in 1904.Helen Adams Keller was born on June 27, 1880, in the small northern Alabama town of Tuscumbia. When she passed away (just weeks before her 88th birthday) on June 1, 1968, Helen was one of the most-admired women in the world, having become friends with ten U.S. Presidents and also having received honorary degrees from several different universities worldwide.Helen was just seven years old when the events depicted in ""The Miracle Worker"" actually took place in the late 1880s. Patty Duke, quite obviously, was much older than that when called upon to portray the 7-year-old Helen, and Patty was almost not cast as Helen for the film. But, despite the discernible age differential, Duke was given the part .... and movie-lovers are all the better for that wise casting decision.A webpage containing an excellent mini-bio on the life of Helen Keller can be found here:[...]The 100th Anniversary (""Centennial Edition"") of Keller's autobiography, ""The Story Of My Life"", is available at Amazon. Here's a quick link:www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451528255/qid=1139542669Anne Sullivan was born Johanna Mansfield Sullivan in Feeding Hills, Massachusetts, on April 14, 1866. In 1886, Anne was named class valedictorian of the ""Perkins Institute For The Blind"". The following year, in March of 1887, she began her work with Helen. Sullivan died in New York at the age of 70 on October 20, 1936.----------------This MGM ""Vintage Classics"" DVD, released in March 2001, sports a very fine-looking version of ""The Miracle Worker"" in its original Widescreen (1.66:1) aspect ratio. The video is not enhanced via the anamorphic process, but the black-and-white film looks quite detailed and sharp nonetheless. A few spots have a slightly washed-out look, but overall it looks great to my eyes. Close-up shots of the actors' faces are especially pleasing and blemish-free. Miss Bancroft looks just fabulous in her screen-filling close-ups here.An example of how good the movie looks on this disc can be obtained by watching the Theatrical Trailer for the film (which is included here as the DVD's lone Special Feature). The 1-minute, 45-second trailer is filled with dirt specks and lacks the crispness of video quality that can be found in the film itself.As far as the audio goes, all of the dialogue is clear and easily understood. MGM Home Entertainment has provided three different Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono soundtracks for this disc -- in English, French, and Spanish. All three of these DVD soundtracks, however, do have quite a bit of background hiss and are a bit scratchy-sounding underneath the dialogue. But this minor audio imperfection didn't keep me from enjoying every last minute of this movie.Given what I can detect on the movie's original English soundtrack, it appears that the filmmakers were forced to do a lot of dubbing of dialogue after several of the outdoor scenes were filmed, in order to make the actors' words more clearly audible. I'm very grateful for this dubbing, too, because I have a feeling that without it the viewer would be left to scratch his or her head in a ""What did he say there?"" manner during some scenes (particularly during the very funny ""ladder"" scene, which features Miss Bancroft being piggybacked to safety by Captain Keller). The dubbed scenes seem to be done quite well, though, in that they don't sound overly artificial, with the end result being bold and clear dialogue during those out-of-doors re-dubbed parts of the film.Other DVD Stats:>> Subtitles are available in French and Spanish (but not English).>> The Chapter count is 16, with four separate Sub-Menus for direct chapter access.>> Menus are simple and non-animated, without music.>> No booklet or insert.>> Keep Case box.---------------""The Miracle Worker"" (1962) is a brilliant and touching character-driven story, featuring two acting performances by Miss Bancroft and Miss Duke that can never be forgotten.

This film  has everything a good film needs, good plot, amazing actors, very compelling moments and above all, a very strong message of faith. Hellen keller was deaf, blind and mute but still, she manage to learn how to communicate and express herself. This is a movie everyone should see at least once.The very first version I've seen of this film was the 1979 remake with Anne Bancroft again, it was about 20 years ago  back in elementary school. I remember being stunned by the power of this film. I think this is why I decided to watched the original version, to see what I think about it now , 20 years later.......The performances by Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke are outstanding! I think one of the comments on the DVD case says something about the film having  some of the most intense action scenes ever caught on film....I think they were right! Some of the scenes in there must've been extremely demanding for Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke. The film also has very funny moments that will make you laugh when you least expect it.I usually like to talk about the cinematography when I review a movie but I guess I'll pass for this one, this was made in 1962 so besides the fact that it's a black and white movie, there's not much to say. I personally found it OK, good quality picture in general, there was also an appropriate use of lights. keep in mind this is 1962 ....so don't be too picky on picture quality....I would definitely recommend it to any Drama fans.

569255,A2VZP50FSYD6CO,B000056HEB,drebbles,"[1, 1]","This touching film is the story of the relationship between Helen Keller and her beloved ""Teacher"", Anne Sullivan. When Anne arrived at Helen's house, Helen, who was blind and deaf from an illness she had as a baby, is a wild child, spoiled rotten by her parents. Anne, newly graduated from The Perkins School for the Blind, is struggling with her own demons - surgery restored her eyesight, but her eyes are very sensitive, and she is haunted by the death of her brother, Jimmy.  The first thing she does is finger spell words to Helen, showing her a doll and spelling the word ""doll"" out in sign language, even though she knows that Helen will not understand what she is trying to do. In one grueling scene, Anne also tries to teach Helen table manners, finally getting her to fold her own napkin. She finally convinces Helen's family to let her go away with Helen for two weeks to teach her discipline. The experiment is a huge success. The experiment is a huge success, but Anne is discouraged that Helen still hasn't grasped the concept of the meaning of words.  She thinks it will take a miracle to reach Helen.""The Miracle Worker"" was a play before it was a movie and at times this movie comes across as a filmed play. This is a bit confining, but it works well in some scenes like when Anne and Helen stay in the cabin by themselves and especially the intense scene where Anne tries to teach Helen to eat from her own plate and not take food from other people's plates. The acting is terrific, both Anne Bancroft as Anne and Patty Duke as Helen deservedly won Oscars for their work.  Although a bit old for the part, Duke is especially brilliant, viewers will really believe she is blind and deaf.There are no extras on this DVD.

Patty Duke, then a prodigious child actress, also recreates her stage performance in the overwhelmingly primal role of the pre-adolescent Helen Keller, the subsequent author and social activist who lost her sight and hearing at nineteen months old. Yet, none of their virtuoso acting overshadows the considerable contributions of director Arthur Penn in making William Gibson's play resonate onscreen in this 1962 film. Using deep focus shadows and compositions and off-kilter camera angles to magnify the intensity of the drama, Penn lends the true-life story even greater emotional impact.Gibson focuses his screen adaptation from the time Keller's condition is recognized by her parents to the moment of revelation at the water pump as Sullivan breaks through to Keller's capacity  for understanding words and their meaning. There are moments of somewhat excessive theatricality, especially at the beginning, but as soon as the plot strips away to just Sullivan and Keller, the drama becomes more propulsive and involving. Speaking with a fey Boston Irish accent and often sporting dark glasses, Bancroft is nothing short of masterful especially in conveying Sullivan's unwavering principles. Duke makes the perfect complement by capturing not only the rawness of her character but also Keller's unabated search for knowledge. I still find many of the supporting performances too overwrought, especially the Keller family portrayed by Victor Jory, Inga Swenson and Andrew Prine. Although this film has been remade at least two times, including a version with Duke as Sullivan, make no mistake that this is still the definitive production. It is impossible not to be moved by the film's last ten minutes.

We're stuck with 2nd-rate sex farce and toilet jokes), to the hit play, to the hit movie, this film displays almost every overdone effort made by Hollywood, starting in the late 50's, to mimick European ""New Wave"" techniques. It's to Bancroft's and Duke's credit that the production doesn't descend into total hysteria from beginning to end. The Playhouse 90 original, which I recall seeing as a teen myself, was somewhat more subdued and, IMHO, more powerful and effective in the final scenes. That said, this is still a remarkable piece of cinema -- despite the fact that there's not a single accurate ethnic speech coloration in the whole movie, and it has some of the laughably worst attempts at Southern accents I've heard since Gone With the Wind and the Tammy movies. It's incredible to think that the movie's imbecilic producers didn't want to import Duke or Bancroft from Broadway to recreate two of the most memorable dramatic roles of the 20th century. The excellent b&w print now seen on DVD is largely the work of Cuban director / photographer Ernesto Caparros who had been involved in cinema since the 1930's. Not only will tv never again give us work like this, but I can imagine how many car chases and napalm bombs Hollywood would have shoved into the script if ""Worker"" were produced today. Thanks to Amazon for including this very good DVD in their free-shipping list.

In the movie finale at the water pump, when Hellen Keller finally understands that ""water"" is a word, the thick shroud of curtains holding her in darkness are opened, letting in the light of understanding. It is a moment that brings tears of joy to the viewer.Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke are absolutely stunning in their portrayals of Anne Sullivan (The Miracle Worker) and Hellen Keller.

Based on the stage play of the same name, it tells the story of how Annie Sullivan brings light into the dark world of Helen Keller.  This is one of the best films of any era.Patty Duke is amazing as Helen Keller.  She is a young girl isolated in a way by her blindness, yet totally controlling of the environment and people around her because of it.  Patty manages to capture the frustration Helen has, that of being an intelligent person unable to fully express herself and grow.  She conveys this all without saying a word until the climatic moment at the end.Anne Bancroft is Annie Sullivan.  Partially blind herself, she is a young woman who has seen and experienced more than her share of poverty and misery in her life.  It is her experience as a child of the institution that shapes the woman she has become and prepares her for the assignment she takes on in teaching Helen.  Anne conveys vulnerability, strength, determination and compassion; and love, as exhibited in the closing scene where she is holding Helen and singing ""Hush Little Baby"" on the porch.  It is a deeply felt and affective performance.It is beautifully shot in black and white, which helps keep the film close to its stage roots.  Victor Jory is the ""Captain,"" Helen's gruff, no nonsense father, who doesn't know what to make of this young ""Yankee"" woman.  Inga Swenson is Helen's younger, fragile mother, hoping for a miracle and reluctantly letting Annie take control of the daughter she loves.  Andrew Prine is Annie's main supporter as Helen's half brother.  They all lend terrific support.I was 12 years old on that Christmas Day in 1972 when I first saw this film.

I found something very intriguing about the plot, the battle of the wills between the firm teacher with the nerves of steel and the stubborn, strong-willed student and how each character learns something at the end. Helen Keller learns how to behave like a civilized person and communicate with the world. Anne Sullivan learns how to work with a blind AND deaf child; before then she had only taught blind students. Arthur and Kate Keller realize they are bad parents because they spoiled Helen and that it&#8217;s not enough to pity a disabled person&#8212;you have to help them overcome their obstacles.Patty Duke and Anne Bancroft give mesmerizing performances in the two leading roles; two of the most deserving Oscar winners I&#8217;ve ever seen. Duke is really just as much a leading role as Bancroft but the reason the judges didn&#8217;t nominate them in the same category is because they didn&#8217;t want to have cancel them out. While Duke&#8217;s performance is mostly moaning, flaying her arms around and throwing things, Bancroft&#8217;s is a marvel of subtlety&#8212;her acting is all done with subtle facial expressions and a low, rich, melodious voice.They are well supported by a trio of truly outstanding performances&#8212;Andrew Prine, the smart-alleck older brother who always has to put his nickel&#8217;s worth in, Victor Jory as the grouchy, cantankerous father with the penetrating voice and best of all Inga Swenson as the fragile, worry-worn mother.Swenson just blew me away with the array of emotions her role required&#8212;she can play nervous and teary-eyed like no other. No matter how many times I&#8217;ve seen this movie I always feel the hairs on the back of my neck stand up and my pulse go up in the beginning at the look on her face when she snaps her fingers at the crib and baby is not responding. Not when she screams&#8212;just THOSE FEW SECONDS before, when the truth slowly dawns on her. I always get choked up at the end at the look on her face when Helen signs &#8216;key&#8217; and she cries for joy now that Helen finally understands the hand signs. Plus having to act beside larger-than-life, theatrical, stagey-styled, booming volcano Victor Jory had to be a BIG challenge.The script crackles with wit and spark and even though there are sections that could have been trimmed that does not deter me from enjoying the overall richness of the dialogue. &#8220;She must be entirely dependent upon me. The clothes she wears the food she eats, fresh air.&#8221; &#8220;The room is a wreck but her napkin is folded.&#8221;The only quibbles I have are:1. Laurence Rosenthal&#8217;s tuneless score. Sometimes it fits the movie well but other times it feels a little disjointed and muddy.2. The overall &#8216;canned&#8217; feel of the film. A lot of times it feels more like a stage play because Arthur Penn doesn&#8217;t use a lot of spacious shots.3. The flashbacks of Anne&#8217;s childhood. They didn&#8217;t need to be fuzzy and grainy because I could tell from the screenplay that they were shadows of the past.Four Stars.",4,Very good with a couple reservations.,1400371200,"05 18, 2014",2014,3415,"['Academy', 'award', 'nominations', 'wins', 'Director-Arthur', 'Penn', 'Screenplay', 'Black', 'White', 'Costume', 'Leading', 'Actress-Anne', 'Bancroft', 'Supporting', 'Actress-Patty', 'Duke.March', 'Boy', 'nominations', 'ScreenplayWins', 'Leading', 'Actress-Patty', 'Duke', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'Supporting', 'Actress-Inga', 'Swenson.The', 'Miracle', 'Worker', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'found', 'something', 'very', 'intriguing', 'plot', 'battle', 'wills', 'firm', 'teacher', 'nerves', 'steel', 'stubborn', 'strong-willed', 'student', 'how', 'character', 'something', 'end', 'Helen', 'Keller', 'how', 'behave', 'civilized', 'person', 'communicate', 'world', 'Anne', 'Sullivan', 'how', 'work', 'blind', 'deaf', 'child', 'then', 'had', 'only', 'taught', 'students', 'Arthur', 'Kate', 'Keller', 'realize', 'are', 'bad', 'parents', 'spoiled', 'Helen', '8217', 'not', 'enough', 'pity', 'disabled', 'person', '8212', 'have', 'help', 'overcome', 'obstacles.Patty', 'Duke', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'give', 'mesmerizing', 'performances', 'two', 'leading', 'roles', 'two', 'most', 'deserving', 'Oscar', 'winners', '8217', 'ever', 'seen', 'Duke', 'really', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'leading', 'role', 'Bancroft', 'reason', 'judges', 'didn', '8217', 'nominate', 'same', 'category', 'didn', '8217', 'want', 'have', 'cancel', 'out', 'Duke', '8217', 's', 'performance', 'mostly', 'moaning', 'flaying', 'arms', 'throwing', 'things', 'Bancroft', '8217', 's', 'marvel', 'subtlety', '8212', 'acting', 'done', 'subtle', 'facial', 'expressions', 'low', 'rich', 'melodious', 'voice.They', 'are', 'well', 'supported', 'trio', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'performances', '8212', 'Andrew', 'Prine', 'smart-alleck', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'always', 'put', 'nickel', '8217', 's', 'worth', 'Victor', 'Jory', 'grouchy', 'cantankerous', 'father', 'penetrating', 'voice', 'best', 'Inga', 'Swenson', 'fragile', 'worry-worn', 'mother.Swenson', 'just', 'blew', 'away', 'array', 'emotions', 'role', 'required', '8212', 'can', 'play', 'nervous', 'teary-eyed', 'other', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', '8217', 'seen', 'movie', 'always', 'feel', 'hairs', 'back', 'neck', 'stand', 'up', 'pulse', 'go', 'up', 'beginning', 'look', 'face', 'when', 'fingers', 'crib', 'baby', 'not', 'responding', 'Not', 'when', 'screams', '8212', 'just', 'THOSE', 'FEW', 'SECONDS', 'before', 'when', 'truth', 'slowly', 'always', 'get', 'choked', 'up', 'end', 'look', 'face', 'when', 'Helen', 'signs', '8216', 'key', '8217', 'joy', 'now', 'Helen', 'finally', 'hand', 'signs', 'having', 'act', 'larger-than-life', 'theatrical', 'stagey-styled', 'booming', 'volcano', 'Victor', 'Jory', 'had', 'be', 'BIG', 'challenge.The', 'script', 'crackles', 'wit', 'spark', 'even', 'are', 'sections', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'trimmed', 'not', 'deter', 'enjoying', 'overall', 'richness', 'dialogue', '8220', 'must', 'be', 'entirely', 'dependent', 'clothes', 'food', 'fresh', 'air.', '8221', '8220', 'room', 'wreck', 'napkin', 'folded.', '8221', 'only', 'quibbles', 'have', 'are:1', 'Laurence', 'Rosenthal', '8217', 'tuneless', 'score', 'movie', 'well', 'other', 'times', 'little', 'disjointed', 'muddy.2', 'overall', '8216', 'canned', '8217', 'feel', 'film', 'lot', 'times', 'more', 'stage', 'play', 'Arthur', 'Penn', 'doesn', '8217', 't', 'use', 'lot', 'spacious', 'shots.3', 'flashbacks', 'Anne', '8217', 's', 'childhood', 'didn', '8217', 'need', 'be', 'fuzzy', 'grainy', 'could', 'tell', 'screenplay', 'were', 'shadows', 'past.Four', 'Stars']",N/A
569279,AAW58LG72PG7I,B000056HEB,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[1, 1]","THE MIRACLE WORKER touches so many nerves that it stands for accomplishing what all want but only a few know how to get.  Before Patty Duke and Ann Bancroft played Helen Keller and Annie Sullivan on Broadway, few ever even thought about the plight of those who were denied sight, sound, and speech, but this movie shook up an unthinking but caring nation enough to realize that help was a function of infinite patience mixed with mental and physical toughness.  There is no need to go into the plot about how one girl denied the use of her senses could rage against everyone and everything until taught by a woman who knew first hand how willpower could overcome disability.  What makes THE MIRACLE WORKER work as a triumph of the human spirit are the many scenes that tested to the limit the ability and vision of Annie Sullivan to somehow penetrate the fog that clouded a mind that in its own way was struggling to reach out for a world of touch and smell that remained only as wisps in a memory before a dread disease robbed her of her senses. There is much face slapping, spoon throwing, and body slamming that stuns the audience with its violence but reaffirms the notion that such extreme actions must be used when nothing else works.  This is a film of desperation.  The Keller family desperately needs help for their daughter Helen whom they do not wish to institutionalize.  Annie Sullivan desperately needs the Kellers not to interfere in a education that will get much worse before it gets better.  And Helen herself desperately needs to find a way to come to grips with a brute world that refuses to allow her a sense of understanding or control. The climax is when Helen has an epiphany.  When she douses her hand with water from the outdoor pump, she suddenly sees a connection between the finger alphabet games she had been idly playing with Annie Sullivan and the real world that she could touch but not internalize.  THE MIRACLE WORKER makes us realize that education goes on all the time for everyone, but for some of us, we must first get our hands wet to know that.",5,To Be Human One Must Feel Human,1247356800,"07 12, 2009",2009,2085,"['MIRACLE', 'WORKER', 'touches', 'so', 'many', 'nerves', 'accomplishing', 'what', 'want', 'only', 'few', 'know', 'how', 'get', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'Ann', 'Bancroft', 'played', 'Helen', 'Keller', 'Annie', 'Sullivan', 'Broadway', 'few', 'ever', 'even', 'thought', 'plight', 'who', 'were', 'denied', 'sight', 'sound', 'speech', 'movie', 'shook', 'up', 'unthinking', 'caring', 'nation', 'enough', 'realize', 'help', 'was', 'function', 'infinite', 'patience', 'mixed', 'mental', 'physical', 'toughness', 'need', 'go', 'plot', 'how', 'one', 'girl', 'denied', 'use', 'senses', 'could', 'rage', 'everyone', 'everything', 'taught', 'woman', 'who', 'knew', 'first', 'hand', 'how', 'willpower', 'could', 'overcome', 'disability', 'What', 'MIRACLE', 'WORKER', 'work', 'triumph', 'human', 'spirit', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'tested', 'limit', 'ability', 'vision', 'Annie', 'Sullivan', 'somehow', 'penetrate', 'fog', 'clouded', 'mind', 'own', 'way', 'was', 'struggling', 'reach', 'out', 'world', 'touch', 'smell', 'remained', 'only', 'wisps', 'memory', 'dread', 'disease', 'robbed', 'senses', 'much', 'face', 'slapping', 'spoon', 'throwing', 'body', 'slamming', 'audience', 'violence', 'notion', 'such', 'extreme', 'actions', 'must', 'be', 'used', 'when', 'nothing', 'else', 'film', 'desperation', 'Keller', 'family', 'desperately', 'help', 'daughter', 'Helen', 'whom', 'do', 'not', 'wish', 'institutionalize', 'Annie', 'Sullivan', 'desperately', 'Kellers', 'not', 'interfere', 'education', 'will', 'get', 'much', 'worse', 'better', 'Helen', 'desperately', 'find', 'way', 'come', 'grips', 'brute', 'world', 'allow', 'sense', 'understanding', 'control', 'climax', 'when', 'Helen', 'epiphany', 'When', 'hand', 'water', 'outdoor', 'pump', 'suddenly', 'connection', 'finger', 'alphabet', 'games', 'had', 'been', 'idly', 'playing', 'Annie', 'Sullivan', 'real', 'world', 'could', 'touch', 'not', 'internalize', 'MIRACLE', 'WORKER', 'realize', 'education', 'time', 'everyone', 'must', 'first', 'get', 'hands', 'wet', 'know']",N/A
569280,A8TZ88OM8YOLW,B000056HEB,MartyHansen,"[0, 0]","The story of Helen Keller is well known.  But how she conquers deafness and blindness bears a powerful message for overcoming other prejudices (racism, sexism) as well.Her teacher, Annie Sullivan (played by the gorgeous Anne Bancroft) is motivated by her own experiences growing up in the dank cruelty of asylums where blind and handicapped children were institutionalized with no chance for education and self fulfillment.  She is driven with a messianic zeal to help her charge who, much like herself, has been similarly deprived.Helen, thought to be dumb, has been relegated by her family's ignorance to the status of a child-like pet; indulged because her infirmities are assumed to be unfixable.By today's standards, the movie's dialog and pacing are a little intense.  And the physical violence (slapping mainly) between teacher and pupil might make some, especially young children, somewhat uncomfortable.  But the performances by both Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke (as Helen) are mesmerizing.Helen, sharp as a tack (which is how she became so manipulative) is starved for knowledge and connection, and Miss Sullivan uses this hunger to bring her out. The story is well paced.

569287,A2JLK1SQ8O03EO,B000056HEB,octobercountry,"[3, 5]","Yesterday I watched The Miracle Worker (1962) for the first time. This is one of those famous films that I've heard about for years, but had never seen before in its entirety. It's also a story that has been dramatized often enough---there have been at least four filmed/televised versions of this picture---but this version is the original theatrical release.When I was young I was interested in the story of Helen Keller (we had a couple of books about her here in the house while I was in grade school), so I was glad to finally view this film of which I had heard high praise. It depicts a very brief period in Helen Keller's life, but the events it shows are basically true to the real story. And I'll agree that both Patty Duke and Anne Bancroft deserved their Oscars (though it was a very tough call in the best actress category, since there were so many outstanding performances that year---Bette Davis, Katharine Hepburn, Geraldine Page, and Lee Remick were the other nominees for the 1963 best actress Oscar).Unfortunately, I was surprised to find that the film overall was not nearly as good as I was led to believe. Several things detracted from my enjoyment of the picture, including very over-the-top and irritating performances by some of the supporting actors. (Man, the opening flashback scenes where Helen's parents find out she's deaf and blind were painful to watch. Now, I heard the histrionics were sort of a comment on how Helen wasn't able to experience this aspect of the world any longer---but I don't know about that. All I know is that it was AWFUL.)Also, the music score is definitely sub-par, in my opinion. It works in a few scenes, but more often than not is wildly intrusive and jarring and serves only to distract one from what's happening on-screen. It really pulls you out of the film, which is precisely what a score SHOULDN'T do. Added to this is the fact that the mix is weird, with the music sometimes sounding like it's playing in a far, echoing distance.The sound is problematic throughout the film, in fact. The tone of the track---dialogue and everything---is very harsh and grating to the ear from beginning to end. There's some bad and obvious looping---a problem with the original mix of the sound elements---and there is a huge amount of hiss and crackle and pop audible on the soundtrack. There's no way a picture from 1962 should sound this bad; I don't know what the problem is, but it definitely needs to be cleaned up. (Though I don't know if the harshness would be softened if the soundtrack were cleaned up; could be that this film would simply sound like crap no matter what.)(Just as a bit of trivia; the film was presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.66:1. I wonder why the director chose to shoot it that way; American films were almost NEVER projected in that aspect ratio----1.85:1 and 2.35:1 were the common American theatrical shapes.)So, not exactly a rave review from me, despite my interest in the story and my admiration for the performances. Oh, I'll recommend a viewing, but this is one that I don't imagine I'd watch very often, if indeed I EVER re-watch it.",3,Not as good as I thought it would be,1347753600,"09 16, 2012",2012,3134,"['Yesterday', 'watched', 'Miracle', 'Worker', '1962', 'first', 'time', 'one', 'famous', 'films', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'years', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'entirety', 'also', 'story', 'been', 'dramatized', 'often', 'enough', '-there', 'have', 'been', 'least', 'four', 'filmed/televised', 'versions', 'picture', '-but', 'version', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release.When', 'was', 'young', 'was', 'interested', 'story', 'Helen', 'Keller', 'had', 'couple', 'books', 'here', 'house', 'was', 'grade', 'school', 'so', 'was', 'glad', 'finally', 'view', 'film', 'had', 'heard', 'high', 'praise', 'very', 'brief', 'period', 'Helen', 'Keller', 'life', 'events', 'are', 'basically', 'true', 'real', 'story', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'deserved', 'Oscars', 'was', 'very', 'tough', 'call', 'best', 'actress', 'category', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'year', '-Bette', 'Davis', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'were', 'other', 'nominees', '1963', 'best', 'actress', 'Oscar', '.Unfortunately', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'film', 'overall', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'led', 'believe', 'Several', 'things', 'detracted', 'enjoyment', 'picture', 'including', 'very', 'over-the-top', 'irritating', 'performances', 'supporting', 'actors', 'Man', 'opening', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'where', 'Helen', 'parents', 'find', 'out', 'deaf', 'blind', 'were', 'painful', 'watch', 'Now', 'heard', 'histrionics', 'were', 'sort', 'comment', 'how', 'Helen', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'experience', 'aspect', 'world', 'longer', '-but', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'know', 'was', 'AWFUL', 'Also', 'music', 'score', 'definitely', 'sub-par', 'opinion', 'few', 'scenes', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'wildly', 'intrusive', 'jarring', 'only', 'distract', 'one', 'what', 'happening', 'on-screen', 'really', 'film', 'precisely', 'what', 'score', 'SHOULD', ""N'T"", 'do', 'Added', 'fact', 'mix', 'weird', 'music', 'sometimes', 'sounding', 'playing', 'far', 'echoing', 'distance.The', 'sound', 'problematic', 'film', 'fact', 'tone', 'track', '-dialogue', 'everything', '-is', 'very', 'harsh', 'grating', 'ear', 'beginning', 'end', 'bad', 'obvious', 'looping', '-a', 'problem', 'original', 'mix', 'sound', 'elements', '-and', 'huge', 'amount', 'hiss', 'crackle', 'pop', 'audible', 'soundtrack', 'way', 'picture', '1962', 'should', 'sound', 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'problem', 'definitely', 'be', 'cleaned', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'harshness', 'would', 'be', 'softened', 'soundtrack', 'were', 'cleaned', 'up', 'could', 'be', 'film', 'would', 'simply', 'sound', 'crap', 'matter', 'what', 'Just', 'bit', 'trivia', 'film', 'was', 'presented', 'original', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.66:1', 'wonder', 'why', 'director', 'chose', 'shoot', 'way', 'American', 'films', 'were', 'almost', 'NEVER', 'projected', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.85:1', '2.35:1', 'were', 'common', 'American', 'theatrical', 'shapes', 'So', 'not', 'exactly', 'rave', 'review', 'interest', 'story', 'admiration', 'performances', 'Oh', ""'ll"", 'recommend', 'viewing', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'imagine', ""'d"", 'watch', 'very', 'often', 'indeed', 'EVER', 're-watch']",N/A

In my childhood, I had read the play and a novel about Anne Sullivan, so I thought we might enjoy this film together.  She asked me to watch it with her, and we sat down and were utterly transported by the story and acting.In a nutshell, it is about an achievement that no one else had ever done, breaking through to communicate with a deaf and blind child, whom her parents had understandably spoilt in their desperation and love.  Sullivan had to get her parents to understand that Helen can put words to objects and thoughts as well as establish authority with her pupil, who is used to getting her way no matter what her behavior.  To do so, Sullivan must fight both Helen and the entire way that the family has adapted to her.  There is the spoilt son from another marriage, the indulgently caring mother at the end of her rope, and her old-south authoritarian father.  This leads, to putit mildly, to a struggle that is existential and entirely believable.  It was so moving that both my daughter and I were reduced to tears of empathy and rage.There is no other film experience like this, with the possible exception of Children of a Lesser God.  Patty Duke is fabulously believable, Bancroft beautifully dogged in her determination to break through the physical and emotional barriers, who must put her own demons to rest while serving the family.  That being said, the spare style of the cinematography is similar to that of the Twilight Zone, which dates the film.Warmly recommended.

This particular production, however, is marred by heavy-handed directing, overly dramatic music, and hamming by everyone but the child actors and Anne Bancroft as Helen Keller's inspirational teacher.

569303,A1ALM6QVPWYS9L,B000056HEB,Stella,"[0, 0]","This movie depicts the story of a woman who loves and appreciates what humans are so much that in front of the whole world she turned a grunting, howling, and mad creature into a dignified, intelligent, and lovely human being. It's a true story and I think that real life transformation is documented extremely well in this telling of The Miracle Worker.Both this and the '79 version (no point in even addressing the 2000 Disney version) achieve the impact of a young girl sealed off from the world (not because of deafness and blindness but through absence of a language to communicate. Keller later even stated that she regrets her speech handicap more than any other limitation) and a woman bound and determined to yank her out of the abyss. The madness and frustration that Keller speaks of in her autobiographical writings I believe is exceptionally represented in both films.It is as raw as I could care to expect without being pretty freaked out and distracted from the overall story. I just so respect how they didn't hold back and that they show Helen as something of a sub-human. I love that Sullivan sees her for the horrible thing she has been let to degrade to and that she demands that she be an Individual human being and that those who don't demand the same couldn't possibly truly care about her becoming something other than a thing that belongs to them whether as their pet or their problem to sigh and feel sorry for themselves over.Anne Bancroft plays Sullivan like a brilliant storm and of course Duke is a storm of equal and opposite force much of the time so it is really perfection. Their relationship is a dance as soon as Sullivan walks up to Helen on the porch. She peers in to her with fascination and obsession from that moment and it never stops. She respects and loves her from the beginning and is in awe of all of the potential. This all leads up to the moment that Helen really comes crashing into our world. This film tells the story that crashing was going to be her only form of entry and that it would involve much tumult and even some violence.I consider this the far superior version and not just because it was ""the first"" since it wasn't the ""first"" to me.

One of our basal reader stories has to do with Laura and Mary Ingall, and to add to the story, we study hand language, samples from the Braille Institute, and as a topper, this movie.  This movie is loved by every kid no matter their attention span or academic level.  Helen is a misfit for most of this movie, and so many kids can relate!  It is also inspirational because of what she did with her life AFTER this episode of her life.  The acting is crazy good--so well cast!  My old VHS tape indicates it's not rated.  Thanks goodness because if it was rated I probably would not be able to show it to my class.  It is not a G rated movie in my opinion because it has yelling, food fights, slapping.  But it is so incrediby powerful.  I watch it once a year with my kids and never get tired of it.  I fast forward the part when Ms. Sullivan mentions asylums and the word ""gonorrhea"" to keep myself out of trouble.

The last time I saw this film, I was a young boy; but I never forgot the story of Helen Keller, her obstacles and how she overcame them with the help of a determined teacher; Anne Sullivan.The film sends a great message to all of us saying that no matter how bad our hand may be that life gives us, there is nothing the human spirit can't overcome, if we simply don't quit. Helen was born blind and deaf. Her parents didn't know how to reach her or teach her; so she grew up in the dark world of her mind.  This was so until a teacher, whose own past was a nightmare to overcome, enters her life to try and bring the light of knowledge and reason into young Helen's dark world.The interplay between Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke is simply Academy Award Winning acting in my book, which this film got; as the two actresses strive to bring forward a well written script sumarizing the war it took to bring light into Helen's mind and who went to become a brilliant teacher in her own right.This is a great film for the entire family and a very spiritually uplifting film when it comes to the battles we all face in life.

Of course, different things appeal to different people, but this resonates with me.  Patty Duke's performance is simply incredible, breathtaking.  The astounding generosity shown by Annie Sullivan... I have studied the lives of Annie & Helen and this movie is just the tip of the iceberg.  Annie was a devil, and Helen is remembered as this a sweet old lady.  Actually, Helen learned to speak & was a socialist, a rabble rouser, and could work crowds into an absolute frenzy.  She was brilliant & beautiful- Mark Twain was in love with her & always trying to get her into bed.  As a child she was fiercely independent and a wild child, ran the countryside alone, deaf and blind.But anyway...for me the wonder of giving a person who is deaf & blind the whole world (language, the means to symbolize, that we take utterly for granted), showing the nuts & bolts of it- no other ending of a film gives me the thrill this one does.
