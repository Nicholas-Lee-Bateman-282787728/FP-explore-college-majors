Amat ""Mugetsu""","[8, 8]","Bought this one for Zombie Hunter Rika(aka: Strongest weapon, High school girl Rika)No point in paying for 1 movie when you can get 3 for the same price.Zombie Self Defence Force.Pretty good movie, tongue in cheek but not slapstick, as the characterstake themselves quite seriously. Gory yes but a bit cheap (as the whole trilogy is)Entertaining? definitely.Attack Girls' Swim Team Vs. The Undead.PINK movie (aka cinemax style soft core)Sexy surgically enhanced lead actress can't really save this movie.The acting is flat and the SFX nearly non existing. Gory yes but super cheap.nonsense plot and lame bad guys.There is about 2 maybe 3 scenes in the whole movie that are worth ogling over.Zombie Hunter Rika.Only movie i really wanted to see, unfortunately only movie I had expectations going in.I really wish this movie was better, as the idea behind it is very cool.But there is just too much lacking with it.I can excuse the cheap SFX if the concept and execution are effective.But I think the problems lies with Rika...She is not portrayed in a MOVIE fashion, she is not sexy or sassy or displays cute but corny bravado.She behaves how a REAL 16 to 17 year old high school girl would in a situation as such...frightened and helpless.Actually Rika is quite vapid, often her allies are slaughtered in front of herwhile she looks on with a look of confoundment  and  horror.By the time her fighting scenes come, the audience is incapable of suspending their disbeliefthat she is the one doing all this zombie butt kicking (which she clearly is not...lol )I really wanted to love ZHR but in the end was mildly entertained by it.",4,Good bang for the buck?,1334448000,"04 15, 2012",2012,1630,"['Bought', 'one', 'Zombie', 'Hunter', 'Rika', 'aka', 'Strongest', 'weapon', 'High', 'school', 'girl', 'Rika', 'point', 'paying', '1', 'movie', 'when', 'can', 'get', '3', 'same', 'price.Zombie', 'Self', 'Defence', 'Force.Pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'not', 'slapstick', 'characterstake', 'quite', 'seriously', 'Gory', 'yes', 'bit', 'cheap', 'whole', 'trilogy', 'Entertaining', 'definitely.Attack', 'Girls', 'Swim', 'Team', 'Vs', 'Undead.PINK', 'movie', 'aka', 'cinemax', 'style', 'soft', 'core', 'Sexy', 'surgically', 'enhanced', 'lead', 'actress', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'save', 'movie.The', 'acting', 'flat', 'SFX', 'nearly', 'non', 'existing', 'Gory', 'yes', 'super', 'cheap.nonsense', 'plot', 'lame', 'bad', 'guys.There', '2', 'maybe', '3', 'scenes', 'whole', 'movie', 'are', 'worth', 'ogling', 'over.Zombie', 'Hunter', 'Rika.Only', 'movie', 'i', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'unfortunately', 'only', 'movie', 'had', 'expectations', 'going', 'in.I', 'really', 'wish', 'movie', 'was', 'better', 'idea', 'very', 'cool.But', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'lacking', 'it.I', 'can', 'excuse', 'cheap', 'SFX', 'concept', 'execution', 'are', 'effective.But', 'think', 'problems', 'Rika', 'not', 'portrayed', 'MOVIE', 'fashion', 'not', 'sexy', 'sassy', 'displays', 'cute', 'corny', 'bravado.She', 'how', 'REAL', '16', '17', 'year', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'would', 'situation', 'such', 'frightened', 'helpless.Actually', 'Rika', 'quite', 'vapid', 'often', 'allies', 'are', 'slaughtered', 'front', 'herwhile', 'look', 'confoundment', 'horror.By', 'time', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'come', 'audience', 'incapable', 'suspending', 'disbeliefthat', 'one', 'doing', 'zombie', 'butt', 'kicking', 'clearly', 'not', 'lol', 'really', 'wanted', 'love', 'ZHR', 'end', 'was', 'mildly', 'entertained']",Nihombie!: The Complete Japanese Trilogy (Zombie Self-Defense Force / Attack Girls' Swimteam vs. the Undead / Zombie Hunter Rika)

All had pretty darn good effects other than the first which had some horrible CG.  Are any of these ""must have"" films?  NO, but Rika and the Swim Team offered your bang for the buck with plenty of gore, and sex to please.  Stories are pretty silly and i just totally had to laugh when you notice they lay cloth on the floors where they are doing the special effects and blood.... LOL.
