1429848,A20E9CQS2ZZZUA,B004V2S4XI,Daryl Wayne,"[0, 0]","Rather than by full season, but I'm guessing this is a low budget show and Nickelodeon is trying to find a way to keep the coffers flowing, even if it means having to buy more discs. The show is well-worth supporting, taking the best bits of the old pre-Elmo Sesame Street conceptually and updating it to be modern and vibrant while still retaining a timeless feel to it. The bitrate of this disc vs. streaming is really odd, though, as it comes across almost like minicams on these DVDs while it seems more &#34;normal&#34; on the streams...",4,Odd way to market this show,1373068800,"07 6, 2013",2013,542,"['Rather', 'full', 'season', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'low', 'budget', 'show', 'Nickelodeon', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'keep', 'coffers', 'flowing', 'even', 'having', 'buy', 'more', 'discs', 'show', 'well-worth', 'supporting', 'taking', 'best', 'bits', 'old', 'pre-Elmo', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'conceptually', 'updating', 'be', 'modern', 'vibrant', 'still', 'retaining', 'timeless', 'feel', 'bitrate', 'disc', 'vs.', 'streaming', 'really', 'odd', 'though', 'almost', 'minicams', 'DVDs', 'more', '34', 'normal', '34', 'streams']",N/A

He watches it nearly every day (28 episodes and counting on the DVR!), so you can imagine how much he squealed with delight when he opened the package. His favorite episode of the four is Circus (and Mommy likes it too because it has Weird Al in it--love him!). Weird Al enlists the Gabba Gang to be part of his circus and they all perform fun circus acts. And the rest of the episodes are just as entertaining too!
