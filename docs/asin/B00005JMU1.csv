621850,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JMU1,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","There are many films about loss released today; films that test the audiences ability to forgive and accept, to condone and condemn.  `The Door in the Floor' is one of those films; a film that never allows room for an easy answer because the questions it asks are as complicated a question as one can find.  While I have never read John Irving's novel `A Window for One Year', of which this film is adapted, I don't feel that the reading of that said novel is necessary to the connection one feels to the film.  I've read that this film is only based on one third of the novel and so one must keep in mind that this story is not over yet (and hopefully it will encourage movie goers to research the novel, as I am in the process of doing myself).`The Door in the Floor' tells the story of Ted and Marion Cole.  Their marriage is rocky at best; slowly deteriorating before their eyes since the death of their two teenage sons crushed their existence.  Since the loss of their sons they have moved and started a new life with their young daughter Ruth (who was not born until after Timothy and Thomas had died).  That life is not one of joy and passion though.  Ted has buried himself in affair after affair if not to shelter himself from the draining depression of his with Marion who doesn't quite seem to function as a person since the death of her boys.  She has drifted away from her former self and has become unable to connect with her husband or even her only daughter.  When Ted decides to hire a young aspiring author to be his helper for the summer he opens the floodgates of his marriage and ultimately his life.Eddie O'Hare is young and nave and reminds both Ted and Marion of the sons they lost.  Marion sees in Eddie a way to connect with her sons once more, by seducing and ultimately sleeping with him.  In this perverse act she has found a sense of solace, allowing herself to physically transcend the boundaries of death and be with her children once more.  Author John Irving said that Marion's curiosity of whether or not her sons died a virgin played heavy in her decision to give herself to Eddie, and in that context one is able to sympathize with this grieving mother even if her heinous crime erodes those sympathies.In the meantime Ted is finding that his life has become railroaded.  His initial reasoning's for hiring Eddie are never made ultimately clear, but it would not be too far fetched to conclude that he knew in a way that the affair was inevitable.  He most likely hoped for it, but as we watch the film we see his fears for what the affair would lead to creep over him.  As the film trickles to its conclusion the audience is given the opportunity to break with these characters, feeling their pain firsthand and ultimately understanding their actions.`The Door in the Floor' would not work if the acting was not above and beyond flawless.  The four main actors all give this film the honesty it needs in order to root itself in our heart.  Young Elle Fanning is, like her sister, born to be a movie star.  Unlike her sister I was able to see a little girl in Ruth as apposed to a little woman.  Their was a hint or glimmer of maturity in her eyes, but that maturity never outweighed the fact that she was only four.  Jon Foster (brother to Ben) delivers a great performance, truly finding the balance between innocent observer and unwilling participant.The real stars here though, are Jeff Bridges and Kim Basinger.  Basinger is not one of my favorite actresses, not by a long shot, but her delivery here is outstanding.  Her character is mentioned throughout the film as `turning to stone' and the dead stare in her eyes emotes that feeling to perfection.  She finds a way of making the hollowness glow with life, for we can read her depression and understand her deterioration.  As good as Kim is though, Jeff Bridges is better.  As Ted, Bridges has the difficult job of making his character understandable, and he does that masterfully.  Ted is charming and likable yet he is repressed in areas that one may not fully grasp.  On the outset it looks as if he has overcome the difficulties of losing a child while his wife has never recovered, but when one studies Ted's actions and, more importantly, Bridges performance one can see the layers of pain that litter his every move.  He wants to be whole again, but Ted not only lost his sons, he lost his wife, and until he gains some of that back he will never be complete.  Ted thrusts himself into his daughter's life (walking up and down the halls telling her stories that are locked away behind glass) creating a way for him to hold onto something, but his grip is waning and Eddie may be the only answer to his growing problem.In the end I have to say that `The Door in the Floor' moved me in ways I cannot fully explain.  I felt deeply touched when the film came to a close, and the final shot of Jeff Bridges descending through that door in the floor has so much more meaning in it than almost any other shot in the film.  Director Tod `Kip' Williams did a masterful job telling this story.  I cannot say how faithful to the novel he was (although John Irving says he was VERY faithful) but I can say that his decision to break the novel down and focus on one section was probably for the best.  This allowed us to really soak in the story and in the end invest ourselves completely into it.Like I said on the outset; there are many films about loss; `The Door in the Floor' is one of the very best.",5,With every door closed another is opened...,1218585600,"08 13, 2008",2008,5496,"['are', 'many', 'films', 'loss', 'released', 'today', 'films', 'test', 'audiences', 'ability', 'forgive',

621851,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00005JMU1,Andy Orrock,"[3, 5]","Jeff Bridges and Kim Basinger are both outstanding in ""Door in the Floor.""  It's like they are inhabiting two completely different movies, a desired effect of writer/director Tod Williams.  Bridges and Basigner are a husband and wife reacting very differently to extreme trauma that has visited their lives within the last two years.  We visit them at the breaking point.Bridges is amazing - through his immense talent and the superb writing/direction of Williams, he is slowly revealed as a cad.  The speed of that revelation is perfect - at the beginning of the film I was left thinking ""Ted Cole (Bridges) seems a bit insufferable and a scoundrel, but I think I'm supposed to like him...how can this be?""  Over the next hour and a half, Williams strips the veneer from Cole layer by layer.  The key moment comes when you realize Basigner has seen it all before.  She lays out in a calm voice the various stages of debasement Bridges puts his muses through.  Sure enough, the next scene between Bridges and Mimi Rogers is a doozy.Tod Williams conceived this movie when he convinced author John Irving to allow him to carve out and film the first section of Irving's ""Widow for One Year.""

621853,AORW1FRF4D4KS,B00005JMU1,azindn,"[7, 8]","The Door in the Floor is a disturbing film. It is a film that examines manipulation, tragedy, marriage, and death. What I found more disturbing are scenes of actor children with actor adult nakedness, a storyline of numerous teen masturbation attempts, and the inevitable older woman/teenage boy sexual relations, with a smearing of ""art is the nude"" in an smarmy, semi-comedic John Irving setting. Based on John Irving's novel, ""A Widow for One Year,"" the story centers on the hedonistic children's book author Ted Cole (Jeff Bridges), his wife, Marion (Kim Bassinger), their four year old daughter, Ruthie (Ellie Fanning), and Eddie (Jon Forester), an Exeter high school student living with the couple as a writer's assistant/chauffeur to Ted. Depicted only in photographs are the dead sons of Ted and Marion, Timothy (age 15) and Thomas (age 17), whose photographs fixate Ruthie, and remain the only evidence of a once happy period in the lives of the parents.The Cole's marriage has disintegrated into a series of eccentricities acted out by Ted a buffoonish celebrity- artist who romps naked across his Long Island estate, is the village debaucher of bored rich housewives with big breasts (Mimi Rogers), and the calculating seducer of mothers and daughters to pose for him. Marion is a cold basket case. A woman so withdrawn she shares an in-town apartment/family home arrangement with Ted and avoids Ruthie, a penance that brings forth the reality of maternal responsibility, a response she judiciously avoids. The thought of her sons and the accident which the family experienced killed more than just their sons as Marion becomes catatonic at the recollection. In this dysfunctional setting Eddie, a young, sexually inquisitive boy is introduced. Marion seduces him and narrates her side of the marriage to Eddie. She also realize the extent she has failed as mother, lover, and wife. Marion is ""difficult"" according to Ted, she is too high maintenance for both Eddie and Ted combined and abandons the home and family as well as her daughter, Ruthie, a point Ted can not fathom.Manipulation of children seem to be the way Ted and Marion communicate: Ted ""gives"" Eddie to Marion because he resembles her dead son, Marion uses Ruthie's neurotic behavior to alienate Ted and underscore his inability to nurture her as a father, and both Ted and Marion use the memory of Timothy and Thomas to destroy everyone in their wake. This is the privilege lifestyle of the Long Island set and it reinforces the role of flanneur which Eddie maintains throughout the film. He is never an insider nor has the morals nor ability to develop them unlike Ruthie whose behavior is already warped and fragile. In a study of classism, privilege, and the disintegration of the family, The Door in the Floor is subtle storytelling unlike the typical American film.Performances by Bridges and Bassinger have the right amount of stop and go, outrageousness and contained rage. Bridges informs young Eddie of his story in the narrative third person, a detachment to his role in the deaths of his sons. As young actors Fanning and the actor who plays Eddie are their victims in another death of the soul, which Eddie fights to salvage. And, while it is a beautiful setting at the surface, the undercurrent of warped values demonstrated by the wealthy Long Island community is not to be admired. With the emphasis on sexuality on display from both adult characters through Bridges and Bassinger, the carnal scenes between adult and children is at times off-putting and far from the pastoral ""Summer of '42"" initiation of youth to adulthood rite of passage. Eddie's initiation is a mental seduction as well as physical molestation by Ted and Marion.All in all, The Door in the Floor requires numerous viewings to grasp the many threads and nuances which make it one of the better movies for thought provoking consideration.",4,Excellent and Enormously Disturbing Adult Film making,1141862400,"03 9, 2006",2006,3901,"['Door', 'Floor', 'disturbing', 'film', 'film', 'manipulation', 'tragedy', 'marriage', 'death', 'What', 'found', 'more', 'disturbing', 'are', 'scenes', 'actor', 'children', 'actor', 'adult', 'nakedness', 'storyline', 'numerous', 'teen', 'masturbation', 'attempts', 'inevitable', 'older', 'woman/teenage', 'boy', 'sexual', 'relations', 'smearing', 'art', 'nude', 'smarmy', 'semi-comedic', 'John', 'Irving', 'setting', 'Based', 'John', 'Irving', 'novel', 'Widow', 'One', 'Year', 'story', 'centers', 'hedonistic', 'children', 'book', 'author', 'Ted', 'Cole', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'wife', 'Marion', 'Kim', 'Bassinger', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Ruthie', 'Ellie', 'Fanning', 'Eddie', 'Jon', 'Forester', 'Exeter', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'living', 'couple', 'writer', 'assistant/chauffeur', 'Ted', 'Depicted', 'only', 'photographs', 'are', 'dead', 'sons', 'Ted', 'Marion', 'Timothy', 'age', '15', 'Thomas', 'age', '17', 'photographs', 'fixate', 'Ruthie', 'remain', 'only', 'evidence', 'once', 'happy', 'period', 'lives', 'parents.The', 'Cole', 'marriage', 'disintegrated', 'series', 'eccentricities', 'acted', 'out', 'Ted', 'buffoonish', 'celebrity-', 'artist', 'who', 'naked', 'Long', 'Island', 'estate', 'village', 'debaucher', 'bored', 'rich', 'housewives', 'big', 'breasts', 'Mimi', 'Rogers', 'calculating', 'seducer', 'mothers', 'daughters', 'pose', 'Marion', 'cold', 'basket', 'case', 'woman', 'so', 'shares', 'in-town', 'apartment/family', 'home', 'arrangement', 'Ted', 'avoids', 'Ruthie', 'penance', 'forth', 'reality', 'maternal', 'responsibility', 'response', 'judiciously', 'avoids', 'thought', 'sons', 'accident', 'family', 'experienced', 'killed', 'more', 'just', 'sons', 'Marion', 'catatonic', 'recollection', 'dysfunctional', 'setting', 'Eddie', 'young', 'sexually', 'inquisitive', 'boy', 'introduced', 'Marion', 'side', 'marriage', 'Eddie', 'also', 'realize', 'extent', 'failed', 'mother', 'lover', 'wife', 'Marion', 'difficult', 'according', 'Ted', 'too', 'high', 'maintenance', 'Eddie', 'Ted', 'combined', 'abandons', 'home', 'family', 'as', 'well', 'daughter', 'Ruthie', 'point', 'Ted', 'can', 'not', 'fathom.Manipulation', 'children', 'seem', 'be', 'way', 'Ted', 'Marion', 'communicate', 'Ted', 'Eddie', 'Marion', 'dead', 'son', 'Marion', 'Ruthie', 'neurotic', 'behavior', 'alienate', 'Ted', 'underscore', 'inability', 'nurture', 'father', 'Ted', 'Marion', 'use', 'memory', 'Timothy', 'Thomas', 'destroy', 'everyone', 'wake', 'privilege', 'lifestyle', 'Long', 'Island', 'set', 'role', 'flanneur', 'Eddie', 'film', 'never', 'insider', 'morals', 'ability', 'develop', 'Ruthie', 'behavior', 'already', 'warped', 'fragile', 'study', 'classism', 'privilege', 'disintegration', 'family', 'Door', 'Floor', 'subtle', 'storytelling', 'typical', 'American', 'film.Performances', 'Bridges', 'Bassinger', 'have', 'right', 'amount', 'stop', 'go', 'outrageousness', 'contained', 'rage', 'Bridges', 'informs', 'young', 'Eddie', 'story', 'narrative', 'third', 'person', 'detachment', 'role', 'deaths', 'sons', 'young', 'actors', 'Fanning', 'actor', 'who', 'Eddie', 'are', 'victims', 'death', 'soul', 'Eddie', 'fights', 'salvage', 'beautiful', 'setting', 'surface', 'undercurrent', 'warped', 'values', 'demonstrated', 'wealthy', 'Long', 'Island', 'community', 'not', 'be', 'admired', 'emphasis', 'sexuality', 'display', 'adult', 'characters', 'Bridges', 'Bassinger', 'carnal', 'scenes', 'adult', 'children', 'times', 'off-putting', 'far', 'pastoral', 'Summer', ""'42"", 'initiation', 'youth', 'adulthood', 'rite', 'passage', 'Eddie', 'initiation', 'mental', 'seduction', 'as', 'well', 'physical', 'molestation', 'Ted', 'Marion.All', 'Door', 'Floor', 'numerous', 'viewings', 'grasp', 'many', 'threads', 'nuances', 'make', 'one', 'better', 'movies', 'thought', 'provoking', 'consideration']",N/A
621854,AR37967IAR6ZT,B00005JMU1,Benjamin,"[11, 16]","&quot;The Door in the Floor,&quot; based upon the first section of John Irving's book, &quot;A Widow for One Year,&quot; is a very faithful, very well-acted adaptation. Since the section of the book was its best, the movie hits all the right notes of both humor and extreme sorrow.Jeff Bridges, in particular, is spectatular as Ted Cole, an alcoholic, adulterous children's author whose marriage was left in shambles by a long-ago accident that killed his two sons. Kim Basinger plays Marion, his detached, shell-shocked wife.The story takes place over the course of the summer that their marriage will end. Marion's distraught and immobile, walking through her life numb while also ignoring her young daughter. Ted, coming up with a way to get himself a driver and perhaps inspire Marion to come out of her funk, hires Eddie, a junior at Exeter, as his &quot;writer's assistant.&quot;Jon Foster plays Eddie, who is supposed to, I fear, be more innately sexy in nature or appealing than Foster plays him. Foster's portrayal captures Eddie's naivete moreso than anything else, and that's the film's chief disappointment, for Eddie is the character who carries the audience through the narrative.Still, there's enough to like in the film that it overcomes its flaws.Mimi Rogers and Donna Murphy also appear in smaller, yet key, roles in the film and are good.

In the same way the overtones change, so does our views and sympathies or prejudices toward the characters.The story is about the interactions between an ""entertainer of children"", Ted Cole(Jeff Bridges), his emotionally catatonic wife Marion(Kim Basinger), their 5 or 6 year old daughter, Ruth(Elle Fanning) and an young aspiring student writer Eddie O'Hare(Jon Foster) that Ted has invited to intern. By the end of the movie we see each of these people differently then we do initially. This takes place at Ted and Marion's beachfront house that they split time occupying as they take turns taking care of Ruth. They are going through a trial separation. Eddie, who has come for the summer to assist with whatever chores or personal needs the couple might place upon him in exchange for Ted's guidance and instruction in becoming a writer, instead gets a big lesson in life. He must interact with these three family members on separate and very different levels. In a sense he becomes a conduit for this increasingly dysfunctional trio. It's last form of communication.The acting by all is terrific. The character development is subtle and at the same time very effective. The interaction is engrossing. The treatment is sensitive and mature. It shows how people are different and how with all their flaws they react differently to the same situations and how those differences make the world go around.

This movie only adds to that weird mystique.In a plot of mostly contained personalities, his character, Ted Cole, is the first to go off kilter and subsequently take everyone along with him. I'm a big proponent of knowing as little about a film outside of the rudimentary plot as is possible and being surprised. Surprised I was.Although some of the scenarios were easily predicatble, many more were original and quirky and stimulating. Also very present is a high sexual tension. If you're looking for smut this is the wrong picture for you. Somes scenes are erotic enough but nothing overtly graphic. And Mr. Bridges walking about in the nude isn't quite my bag (I'm a guy, come on!) but for the most part it is in line with the tight script. The few times it(the nudity and eroticism) was a bit awkward are when the little girl, his daughter, is exposed to it. But I suppose that it was carefully edited and only shocking for it's realism.The cast of characters and actors also were very engaging. From the young man who plays Cole's assistant, to the stoic(stony might be a better word) Kim Basinger (Mrs. Cole) down to Mimi Rogers' supporting act as an unstable debutante.

He finds himself falling into an affair with Marion, the author's wife, and being used as a pawn between the husband and wife.But the story isn't so much about Eddie's loss of innocence, which is of course profound as he becomes the much older woman's lover, as it is about Ted grappling with a dead marriage that fell apart after a car accident that killed their sons.

As soon as I finished watching it, however, I found it to be a really good film. The film tells the story of Ted and Marion Cole, a middle-aged couple who are going through a marital crisis due to the devastating death of their two teenage sons. An aspiring teenage writer named Eddie is hired as their assistant for the summer, and soon he forms a sexual relationship with Marion. Throughout the story, we get to know these people more, and we get to mostly understand why they are the way they are. I believe that's the strongest part of The Door in the Floor: the way these characters develop realistically. But the film overall is very good as well. It has a clever script, beautiful cinematography, and some very nice music. I did have two problems. A few humorous moments are indeed essential to the grim reality of the plot, but there were two moments that made me feel a bit awkward (I won't describe them since they may be considered spoilers). And the other problem I have is the film does slow down in the second half of the film, and a couple of scenes do tend to look very tedious (even if they are relevant to the story). But those are the only bad things about the film, and everything else is made with care. This is a film that gives some fascinating character studies and showcases believable performances from Bridges, Basinger, and Foster.

The babysitter, sure (Bijou Phillips, good but unheralded in an admitedly small part.) But someone's mum? He might think, ""not bad"", but he'd be having a Barclay's over the help. And I didn't buy him getting caught having a Barclay's either. If you were going to do something that risky with someone's underwear, you wouldn't risk it with someone in the house. And if you did, at that the very least you'd find out where they were in the house and be acutely aware of the slightest creak which an old house would have plenty of. Basinger appears like a ghost. Nope.In the special features, John Irving appears unconcerned about the impact of the couple on the young student because he says the young always get over things quickly and move on. This is palpable nonsense. Getting used by selfish and corrupt people at a young age can do lasting and heart felt damage. This sneeking admiration of the repulsive couple and the suggestion that the student is somehow matured and enlightened by the experience, makes Floor in the Door a hard sell.

621870,A39C2BQXZHOUMJ,B00005JMU1,G. Dowling,"[1, 1]","""The Door in the Floor"", based on the first third of John Irving's (The Cider House Rules, The World According to Garp):""A Widow for One Year"", tells the story of a famous children's author Ted Cole(Jeff Bridges) and his wife Marion (Kim Bansinger) who are still coping with the death of their teenage sons and trying to raise a very young daughter Ruth (a wee Elle Fanning from this past summer's ""Super 8"").  Ted hires a prep school student, Eddie O'Hare (Jon Foster) to be his assistant for the summer, although Eddie serves more as Ted's chaffeur as he los his drover's license due to multiple DUIs.  ""The Door in the Floor"" takes a family whom on the surface appear funtional but Eddie offers the audience a closer look at the oles nd the festering rot that is belied by their beautiful Hamptons home and idyllic scenery.  Ted is a narcisstic, alcoholic, who has swallowed his grief and acts it out in a multitude of self-destructive ways.  Marion is soft-spoken, kindly, but is clearly a fragile shell of who she once was, and both of the Cols routinely neglect teir young daughter who tries desperately to connect with tem through a hallway full of photographs of teir dead sons as she has her father take her through each photo daily, demanding to be told the story behind each one.  Eddie is a shy, slim, but handsome boy who is shell-shocked by Ted's gregarious temperment and he falls madly in love with the beautiful Marion.  Ted and Marion are estranged, and take turns staying at an apartment they keep in town.  Eventually, Eddie and Marion begin a sexual relationship as the become emotionally closer to the extent that Marion can connect to anyone.  Marion literally turns catatonic at the mention of the car accident which claimed her sons.""The Door in the Floor"" is largely a character piece focusing on the relationships between these three people and the ensuing events are by turns funny, riveting, an utterly heartbreaking.  It would be a crime for me to reveal the twists and turns and motivations of the characters, but it must be said this is one of the best acted pieces I have ever seen.  I'm not certain why this film did not receive more Oscar attention as this is the kind of film the Academy loves, and Irving's adaptations have traditionally been award magnets.  Bridges yet again creates a fully lived-in performance, imbuing Ted with a humanity many may feel the character may not deserve.  By all accounts, we should despise him given his actions and is self-centeredness and cruelty.  Bridges never attempts to soften the edges, but instead shows us all the facets and flawed, outrageous humanity of the character, who much like Marion, we can see he used to be a different person before the death of his sons.I amnot usually a big fan of Basinger, but she gives the best performance of her career here.  I cannot imagine anyone else playing the part.  She, conversely to Bridges, appears likable at the surface as she speaks in a maternal whisper and says very kind things to young Eddie but sh is every bit as destructive as Ted is, but she internalizes her agony making her hushed tone more like she's choking on her grief like gun that continually fires into her heart every day.  Her affair with young Eddie should also put he audience off, but there is a kind of romantic logic to their relationship as they are both such achingly lonely people.  More devastating is Eddie mistaking Marion's need for solace as love, leading up to the boy's first true heartbreak.  Basinger does this so masterfully, I simply forgot I was watching Kim Basinger.  Having read the book, I can tell you she IS Marion Cole.Newcomer Jon Foster gives a beautiful performance.  He gives Eddie such a naive innocence and a kind of accessibility such that we feel for him and even feel protective of him.  He enters the Cole home a boy but ends up leaving a young man.  Through the Coleshe receives his first true taste of adulthood and the heartbreak and disappointment it often entails.  Foster holds his own very well aginst Bridges, who could hae easily swallowed him whole.Bridgs gives another Oscar worthy performance here as does Basinger.  The film was directedby Tod Williams (who also wrote the screenplay).  Williams is more recently known for his deft direction of ""Paranormal Activity 2"".  Williams made a very smart choice in only telling the story of the first third of the novel.  The book largely focuses on the adult Ruth and the adult Eddie, which in the novel, is the last interesting portion.  The first thrid is the best.  Williams injects a lot of humor into the sory, in fact there are many laugh out loud moments, which is rare for a piecelike this which could have been a true downer.  The humor works so well because it emerges from the characters and the relationships.  ""The Door in th Floor"" earns all of its emotions.The film is beautifully photgrapher, scored and edited.  Williams simply hit evry note spot-on here.  I highly recommend this film for purchase, as I suspect those who enjoy it will want to watch it several times.  ""The Door in the Floor"" may not have received the attention it deserved in its initia theatrical run, but I strongly recommend you discover it now.  You will be glad you did.

While &quot;The Door in the Floor&quot; qualifies on that count (albeit strangely), it fails on so many others that I am not likely to be going back for seconds as I did for the two aforementioned works. The plot unfolds in a far cruder manner in the film than it does in Irving's novel, Bassinger's performance is stale and forced, and there is hardly a single believable character in the entire film. It isn't as though Irving's &quot;Widow For One Year&quot; is the warmest of stories, but while the novel's lack of compromise still manages to engage and draw in the reader, its big screen counterpart just retreats farther and farther from the viewer as it goes on. This is unquestionably the shining moment in Jeff Bridges' career, but the problem, of all things, is that he does his job too well; conveying the brokenness and eccentricity of his character so convincingly that he serves only to expand the distance between story and audience. And if I had to hear him say one more time that he is &quot;an entertainer of children&quot; and &quot;likes to draw,&quot; I would have flung my soda. This is just one of many examples of how the script so desperately strives to achieve the compelling tale Irving wove in the book. There is just no way into these people; not a single passage through which we can get into their minds, hearts or souls to understand where they are coming from. The consequence, ultimately, is that it is difficult to care or even feel for them as they navigate through the pain of their tragic loss: two sons dead in a terrible car accident for which the parents (especially the alcoholic father) blame themselves. One reviewer perceptively noted that this is &quot;a film about child abuse.&quot; I do not disagree, and that fewer people raise this objection amid these scenes of statutory rape (Bassinger's character sleeping with her husband's 16-year old assistant) is troubling. But that is not where the abuse ends: Mr. Cole pruposely pelting the boy in a ferocious game of squash, or how he responds to the family babysitter's sobbing plea for understanding with callous wit and insult, ultimately driving the teenage girl to quit in a teary and helpless fit. Most disturbing is the film's incestuous connotation: Mr. Cole telling the boy that he &quot;gave&quot; his wife to him because he looked like his deceased son.

621874,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005JMU1,Grady Harp,"[4, 5]","John Irving's A WIDOW FOR ONE YEAR was an epic, sprawling story of one woman's crisis, collapse and redemption, and though the story span some 35 years it was tight enough in the novel to make an extraordinary movie.  Director Tod Williams elected to take one summer out of that book, manipulate it into a full length movie, and what results is a story about a man rather than a woman: the results are a mixed bag. If you have read the book, be prepared to see a story that is like a page roughly torn from the whole.Ted (Jeff Bridges) and Marion (Kim Basinger) are a couple in the process of finally separating after a long marriage: Marion has been an emotional paralytic since the accidental death of her their college sons many years ago and Ted has become a scallywag adulterous alcoholic in an attempt to escape the past crisis and the present state of Marion.  Ted, a writer and illustrator of children's books, invites a young Exeter student Eddie (Jon Foster) to their home on Long Island to be his 'driver assistant' (apparently his alcoholism prevents his driving) and to offer a plaything for Marion.  Eddie arrives, finds the family in shreds, including the young daughter Ruth (Elle Fanning) who has failed to fill the hole left by the death of the sons and who is ignored my Marion, and witnesses not only Ted's smarmy affair with an aging wealthy neighbor (Mimi Rogers) whom he 'uses' as a nude model for his illustrations, but also becomes enamored with Marion who will be his first coming of age sexual experience.These are all games people play and the games have consequences.  The manner in which these four people react to the summer of incidents serves as the focal point of this story.The film suffers from a depression that extends into the audience unresolved and that is where this reviewer takes umbrage with the excerpt from a good book. To the DVD's advantage there is an added conversation with John Irving which informs us that he feels this 'adaptation' works better on film then had the entire story been told.  Sounding a bit like a plug for viewers to buy his book to see what happens next is forgivable:  Irving speaks intelligently and cohesively and definitely makes up for the flaws in the film.The acting is good if monochromatic and static.  Oddly, the only one for whom we have concern is Ted - a sad statement given his despicable character.  But the reason for that concern is the portrayal by Bridges who is wholly immersed in this role.  Kim Basinger starts flat and stays there: perhaps casting someone other than Jon Foster as her surrogate son/lover would have helped her plight.  A good film that could have been so much better.

The details of  that tragedy are given more importance than seem necessary and the film ultimately centers on a ""Summer of '42"" plotline and Jeff Bridges'  breezy seasoned performance.",3,BRIDGES,1107648000,"02 6, 2005",2005,457,"['Yes', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'superb', 'Door', 'Floor', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'much', 'Aside', 'bland', 'symbolism', 'title', 'film', 'only', 'romantic', 'drama', 'leaning', 'heavily', 'sadness', 'post-grieving', 'parents', 'adjusting', 'life', 'death', 'teenage', 'sons', 'details', 'tragedy', 'are', 'given', 'more', 'importance', 'seem', 'necessary', 'film', 'ultimately', 'centers', 'Summer', ""'42"", 'plotline', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'breezy', 'seasoned', 'performance']",N/A
621876,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B00005JMU1,Haunted Flower,"[1, 1]","The Door in the Floor DVD Review1 Disc Widescreen Edition (2004)This movie is adapted from John Irving's best-selling novel A Widow for a Year. If you don't remember this author's name, you might remember the movie made from another one of his books, The Cider House Rules. This movie stars Jeff Bridges, Kim Basinger, Jon Foster, and Elle Fanning (yes, Dakota's little sister who often plays the younger version of Dakota in films).Jeff Bridges plays Ted Cole, a cynical but wise children's book writer who is married to Kim Basinger's Marion Cole, but they've grown apart and he makes the decision they should have a trial separation to see if they can work things out. Things have been really hard on the family since their sons, Timothy and Thomas were killed in a car accident and Marion is very depressed and often goes into periods of time where she ""turns to stone"" and just stares off into space at the very thought of what she has lost. This results in a lack of attention towards her young daughter she had after the accident, Ruth (Elle Fanning).Ted hires on Jon Foster's Eddie O'Hare, a teen aspiring to be a writer himself just to work for him for the summer doing various odds and ends but mostly as a driver. Eddie is attracted to Marion and unexpectedly, she responds to him for her own reasons. Being through such traumatic ordeals, however, she is not to be judged for her actions. Ted is completely aware of what is going on and just wants her to be happy. The three of them get very tangled up and it gets to a point where you just know you're watching real people. They have many layers and motives. As a result, you can like all of them and they are spared from judgement.This won't be a film for everyone. Not if you don't like long films or films that are mostly about talking but it has some good comic moments as well as a bit of slapstick in one scene. If you want to be taken in and told a good story, you should see this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The use of muted color with a one or two deviations in each frame really give a feel for the atomsphere and location of the film. I really like it but it didn't blow me away out of my seat.DVD Extras:The making-of documentary really explores how they case the actors. Jon Foster had to lose weight to appear more of a nerd in the beginning of the movie. Kim Basinger had a lot of doubts about taking on such a deep, emotional role but pulled it off beautifully. Jeff Bridges had a lot of influence in the editing process because he had such a great feel for the story.For those who don't know, this movie is only based off the first third of the book, ""A Widow For a Year"". The story was told from little Ruthie's point of view but this movie focused on the beginning so if you want to know the complete story, you can read the whole book. There's a feature starring John Irving called ""From Novel to Screen"" where he goes into detail about differences and similarities between the movie and the book and reveals more about the characters.There is feature commentary with the director Tod Williams and the production team. They talk a lot about the mood of the film, the colors and lighting to get a feel for that beach area and the addition of small things like a $400 block of cheese to throw in the money feel. Also they used a small element of color in each scene in one object to attract attention and kept the rest in muted tones. They explore individual shots and when there's a real slap and when there isn't, etc. It's very interesting for the person who is already a fan of the material.",4,The Door in the Floor DVD Review,1267401600,"03 1, 2010",2010,3580,"['Door', 'Floor', 'DVD', 'Review1', 'Disc', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', '2004', 'movie', 'adapted', 'John', 'Irving', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'A', 'Widow', 'Year', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'author', 'name', 'might', 'remember', 'movie', 'made', 'one', 'books', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'movie', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'Jon', 'Foster', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'yes', 'Dakota', 'little', 'sister', 'who', 'often', 'younger', 'version', 'Dakota', 'films', '.Jeff', 'Bridges', 'plays', 'Ted', 'Cole', 'cynical', 'wise', 'children', 'book', 'writer', 'who', 'married', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'Marion', 'Cole', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'apart', 'decision', 'should', 'have', 'trial', 'separation', 'see', 'can', 'work', 'things', 'out', 'Things', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'hard', 'family', 'sons', 'Timothy', 'Thomas', 'were', 'killed', 'car', 'accident', 'Marion', 'very', 'depressed', 'often', 'periods', 'time', 'where', 'stone', 'just', 'stares', 'off', 'space', 'very', 'thought', 'what', 'lost', 'results', 'lack', 'attention', 'young', 'daughter', 'had', 'accident', 'Ruth', 'Elle', 'Fanning', '.Ted', 'hires', 'Jon', 'Foster', 'Eddie', ""O'Hare"", 'teen', 'aspiring', 'be', 'writer', 'just', 'work', 'summer', 'doing', 'various', 'odds', 'ends', 'mostly', 'driver', 'Eddie', 'attracted', 'Marion', 'unexpectedly', 'own', 'reasons', 'Being', 'such', 'traumatic', 'ordeals', 'however', 'not', 'be', 'judged', 'actions', 'Ted', 'completely', 'aware', 'what', 'going', 'just', 'be', 'happy', 'three', 'get', 'very', 'tangled', 'up', 'point', 'where', 'just', 'know', ""'re"", 'watching', 'real', 'people', 'have', 'many', 'layers', 'motives', 'result', 'can', 'like', 'are', 'spared', 'judgement.This', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'film', 'everyone', 'Not', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'long', 'films', 'films', 'are', 'mostly', 'talking', 'good', 'comic', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'bit', 'slapstick', 'one', 'scene', 'want', 'be', 'taken', 'told', 'good', 'story', 'should', 'see', 'movie', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'use', 'muted', 'color', 'one', 'two', 'deviations', 'frame', 'really', 'give', 'feel', 'atomsphere', 'location', 'film', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'blow', 'away', 'seat.DVD', 'Extras', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'really', 'how', 'case', 'actors', 'Jon', 'Foster', 'had', 'lose', 'weight', 'appear', 'more', 'nerd', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'had', 'lot', 'doubts', 'taking', 'deep', 'emotional', 'role', 'pulled', 'off', 'beautifully', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'had', 'lot', 'influence', 'editing', 'process', 'had', 'such', 'great', 'feel', 'story.For', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'only', 'based', 'off', 'first', 'third', 'book', 'Widow', 'Year', 'story', 'was', 'told', 'little', 'Ruthie', 'point', 'view', 'movie', 'focused', 'beginning', 'so', 'want', 'know', 'complete', 'story', 'can', 'read', 'whole', 'book', 'feature', 'starring', 'John', 'Irving', 'called', 'Novel', 'Screen', 'where', 'detail', 'differences', 'similarities', 'movie', 'book', 'reveals', 'more', 'characters.There', 'feature', 'commentary', 'director', 'Tod', 'Williams', 'production', 'team', 'talk', 'lot', 'mood', 'film', 'colors', 'lighting', 'get', 'feel', 'beach', 'area', 'addition', 'small', 'things', '400', 'block', 'cheese', 'throw', 'money', 'feel', 'Also', 'used', 'small', 'element', 'color', 'scene', 'one', 'object', 'attract', 'attention', 'kept', 'rest', 'muted', 'tones', 'explore', 'individual', 'shots', 'when', 'real', 'slap', 'when', ""n't"", 'etc', 'very', 'interesting', 'person', 'who', 'already', 'fan', 'material']",N/A

Here's the script:  The movie is about people in quirky New England.  You watch them live their lives.  Everything seems sort of normal in the beginning.  There are marital problems between Jeff Bridges and Kim Basinger, but it seems like they are handling it maturely.  Insert here a college boy (hollywood suggests this fellow is your average college duude) to act as our sort of, on-camera witness to this family.  As the movie unfolds, you realize Jeff and Kim do not behave like normal people do.  Finally you find out why they are all screwed up.  And then it ends.  I guess in Hollywood, its OK to be sociopathic if you have a troubled past.  Hollywood rationalizes self-destructive behavior.  So what else is new?Don't try to figure out the door in the floor or what kind of publisher would call ""that"" a childrens story.  There is tragedy in the lives of these rich people and they have difficulty with day to day life.  The way they cope is both humorous and tragic.  Watch this movie for the lighter side.  See it to enjoy attractive naked people (sans Jeff Bridges).  Tom Cruises' ex, Mimi Rogers, bares it all.  Kim, just about all.  Both are still in great shape.  Laugh at the silly situations these addled rich people get themselves into.  Find humor in the college dudes doofusness.That's all your going to get, though, sporadic chortles.  Its a souped-up reality TV show. You get to watch people do stupid things (see Jackass, the Movie), but you don't learn anything.  Except how to wallow in your own misery... with panache.

621880,AI8X8Y6KU7XXK,B00005JMU1,Jason Horsley,"[3, 4]","Jeff Bridges finally has a good, juicy role to sink his enormous acting chops into. Jeff is a funny actor, because if he doesn't have a good part or a solid project to bring out his Herculean talents, he tends to walk through a movie and be indistinguishable from any other actor, becoming a kind of non-entity (as happened with the execrable, New Age slop K-Pax, in which Spacey did his nice guy routine again). But when Bridges gets a role to suit him, such as The Fisher King, The Fabulous Baker Boys, Fearless, American Heart, or to a lesser degree Door, he carries the movie to another plateau altogether.I first saw Jeff in Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, back in my teenage Eastwood-mania days, and I still find it interesting to watch the movie and see how much more likeable and empathic Clint's acting is here than in any of his other films from the same period. From the start, Jeff Bridges had an easy affability, a lazy, laughing spontaneity, that made him both lovable and completely believable, and it's clear in this movie that Bridges' immense appeal rubs off on Clint, and that the relationship between the two men (a young drifter and a hardened criminal who team up on a heist) was reflected by that of the two actors making the movie (Bridges was just starting out, Clint, maybe 15 years older, was by then fully established).My personal favorite Bridges role has got to be Baker Boys, however; in fact it may be my all-time favorite performance by any actor anywhere (De Niro's Travis Bickle and Pacino's Michael Corleone would be two others). Here Jeff, as the Jazz-loving, piano-playing half of a cheesy musical lounge duo, gets to act alongside his real-life brother Beau, and there is such a natural affinity between them (even when fighting) that the movie really flies. (It was written and directed by Steve Kloves, who along with Keith Gordon may be the most underrated American filmmaker around.) When Bridges is at his best, the movie enters into magikal realms of empathy and humor that few other movies even seem aware exist. It doesn't hurt having Michelle Pfeiffer along for the ride, either. She and Bridges make probably the most convincing and achingly doomed lovers ever seen on the American screen.Door in the Floor, directed by Tod Williams (The Adventures of Sebastian Cole) from a book by John Irving (Williams wisely only adapted the first third of the novel), is an original and entertaining work. Though perhaps in the end it is a little removed from its characters and hence slightly less than fully involving, it at least avoids the sentimental pitfalls that some of the other Irving adaptations have fallen into. Above all, it has Jeff Bridges as the eccentric, philandering painter/children's writer, Ted Cole. As Bridges plays him, Cole has hidden reservoirs of pain lurking beneath his abrasive charm. Cole has an irresitable (seeming) indifference to what people think of him, and there are few things more charming in a movie protagonist than not giving a damn about anyone. Although he has been written as something of a fraud and a jerk, Bridges gives Cole the freedom to create his own justification in our minds: he is a law (and a laughter) unto himself.Bridges clearly revels in the task of creating Cole, and the delight he takes in fleshing out an already meaty role and making it his own fills every scene he's in to the brim.

A few recent films have treated the dysfunction attendant upon the death of a child to a loving couple. A movie or two has also touched on the sexual relationship between an older woman and a younger man. `Door in the Floor,' based on John Irving's novel `Widow for a Year,' combines both subjects in a sometimes disturbing, always absorbing screenplay that has a superlative performance by Jeff Bridges and an excellent turn by Kim Basinger.Since `The Graduate,' the possibility in films of a younger man/older woman theme has become as acceptable as the traditional reverse. In writer/director Tod Williams' (`The Adventures of Sebastian Cole') `Door in the Floor,' the young 16-year-old Eddie is played by Jon Foster (`Life as a House') with an annoying lack of charisma and animation. However, Kim Basinger as his love interest, Marion, a mother who has lost 2 sons about his age in an auto accident, for which she feels some responsibility, appropriately lacks animation because of her trauma, a kind of `Stepford' mother exorcising her demon by sleeping with a son's surrogate. That acting is believable even if her `method' may be thinking of her combat with a notorious Baldwin boy. If you are sensitive to such things, the movie deserves its R rating. There is male nudity, from the rear, and full frontal female nudity. The language is about what one would expect from an R rated movie.`The Door In the Floor' is memorable for two big reasons. 1). Jeff Bridges due to his performance and  2).The very last scene, you will realize the full import of Ted Cole's world-view, and you'll see the treatment of his character in the movie in a completely new light.

I know a lot of people give Williams credit for not trying to do too much with the novel and cram it all into a movie, which would have been an impossible challenge.  Still, I like when the movie is somewhat different from the book (The Cider House Rules is a masterpiece of an adaptation because they are two separate stories than can be enjoyed on different levels, but fans can see the similarities).  With this, I felt like I was reading the book, only people who didn't look like Ted, Marion, and Ruth were acting it out.  There was nothing above the basic book storyline to make me look at the plot in a new light.That being said, if you can divorce yourself from the book, as a stand-alone, I think this is probably an excellent movie.

This is the time she realizes the earth exists because of procreation.  In her children, she sees the potential fulfillment of her every hope, her every dream.  No matter how disappointed or confused she is about motherhood, she knows one thing:  She would die for her children.  She loves them endlessly.  She knows these are not just words.Marion (Kim Basinger) is scary because she is so real.  Ask a roomful of mothers what they would do if their children died, and you might be suprised at how many say that would be the end of their life too.(Spoiler warning!)  Marion is the mother who killed herself when her children died -- even though she did not physically take her own life.  She killed herself through deadening her heart.She feels echoes of her husband's love, but he has (spoiler warning!) grabbed more firmly upon the bottle and other women to keep himself afloat and alive after the death of his sons.  These distractions keep his life -- deceptively -- vibrant.  Shallow, cold, distant, but (to cop the title of an old movie) ""an Imitation of Life.""  He believes himself alive, but part of him has died, too.Slowly, the realization of Ted's lifestyle filters through Marion's fog of dispair, giving her the strengh to leave -- completely.This movie vividly expresses the sexual relationship between Marion and a young male assistant (to her husband) who represents both of the deeply powerful aspects of her sons -- popularity and shy wisdom.While the character may seem perverse, I belive that Marion knew that this boy was not a flesh and blood son of hers, but rather a symbol.  A Son.  And she did not want the possibility of death to skew his chances of having the one thing that every teen boy values above all.I can see where a viewer could become disgusted or confused, but I think the movie is rendered delicately enough to communicate its real message.  A mother's mourning never ceases.  Not through any life change, not through hope, not through anything.Fortunately, there is enough sensitively-rendered comedy to help lift the darker moods of this movie.Marion -- in the end -- was the central character.  No other character was as important.  I think it was clear in the sparse way she decorated her house, the sparse way she existed (without any care of pools or lawns or sociializing), that she had taken the role of the living dead.Redeemingly, Kim Basinger added an element to Marion that made me think she loved her living daughter Ruth despite the fact that she (Marion) felt she had no love left in herself.  (Spoiler warning!)  Even when she left Ruth, you felt she loved Ruth, but that she could never acknowledge that love.A painful, mysterious, all too real, then completely unreal movie.

Since the older woman is the spitting image of Kim Bassinger, how lucky can a guy get?Author Ted Cole (Jeff Bridges) and his wife Marion (Bassinger) live on the seashore in the East Hamptons with their daughter Ruth (Elle Fanning). The couple had also had two sons, but they were killed as teenagers in a particularly gruesome auto accident. Since then, Marion has withdrawn emotionally from her husband. It doesn't help that Ted, also a sketch artist, has sordid sexual affairs with his models, mostly local women drawn to his fame as a writer of children's books. So now, Ted and Marion begin a trial separation, the two alternating solo nights at home caring for Ruth with stays at the ""apartment in town"". In the meantime, Ted hires a high school junior, the 16-year old Eddie (Jon Foster, resembling a very young Ryan O'Neal), to help with the editing of his next book. Eddie immediately falls in lust with Marion, who subsequently seduces him with minimal effort, and who, by Eddie's reckoning, has coitus with him 60 times by the film's end.THE DOOR IN THE FLOOR has manipulation as its theme; Ted and Marion manipulate Eddie and each other. Eddie is the innocent party here, though it could be argued that sleeping with another man's wife isn't blameless. For his part, Ted wants custody of Ruth if his troubled marriage leads to divorce, so he hires Eddie, who resembles the oldest, dead son, knowing the attraction he'll have for Marion, and vice versa. Ted wants Marion to have an affair with the boy, thus rendering her judicially unfit to be a guardian. On the other hand, Marion freely admits that having Ruth was a mistake, so perhaps she doesn't want custody anyway; her seduction of Eddie certainly seems calculated. Indeed, she wonders out loud if her oldest son ever had sex before he died, and substitutes the virginal Eddie for the former in her own private Sex Ed class.This film has a superficial resemblance to 2004's CLOSER in that it's about adults assaulting one another using sex as the weapon. While the emotional violence in the latter is more spontaneous and heated, here it seems coldly calculated. The dramatic tone is better maintained in CLOSER, however. THE DOOR IN THE FLOOR includes a slapstick sequence wherein Ted's current mistress comes after him first with a carving knife, than an SUV. While this provides the audience with comic relief, it mars the film's consistency. For that reason, I'm subtracting a star.Ted and Marion are two world-wise grown-ups emotionally exhausted with each other probing the limits of their residual relationship and seeking justification for the ultimate break-up, and Eddie is the means to an end. While I'm not an avid fan of Jeff Bridges, I've seen enough of his screen characters to suggest that this is perhaps his most complex and nuanced role to date. It's a performance worth an Oscar nomination. Bassinger's Marion is perhaps too controlled a character to provide the substrate for a great dramatic performance, but, at 51, Kim is still a Hot Babe, and that's enough for me.",4,Every teenage boy's fevered fantasy,1105401600,"01 11, 2005",2005,3154,"['THE', 'DOOR', 'IN', 'THE', 'FLOOR', 'have', 'older', 'woman', 'seducing', 'sexually', 'exploiting', 'teenage', 'boy', 'older', 'woman', 'spitting', 'image', 'Kim', 'Bassinger', 'how', 'lucky', 'can', 'guy', 'get', 'Author', 'Ted', 'Cole', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'wife', 'Marion', 'Bassinger', 'live', 'seashore', 'East', 'Hamptons', 'daughter', 'Ruth', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'couple', 'had', 'also', 'had', 'two', 'sons', 'were', 'killed', 'teenagers', 'particularly', 'gruesome', 'auto', 'accident', 'then', 'Marion', 'withdrawn', 'emotionally', 'husband', ""n't"", 'help', 'Ted', 'also', 'sketch', 'artist', 'sordid', 'sexual', 'affairs', 'models', 'mostly', 'local', 'women', 'drawn', 'fame', 'writer', 'children', 'books', 'So', 'now', 'Ted', 'Marion', 'begin', 'trial', 'separation', 'two', 'alternating', 'solo', 'nights', 'home', 'caring', 'Ruth', 'stays', 'apartment', 'town', 'meantime', 'Ted', 'high', 'school', 'junior', '16-year', 'old', 'Eddie', 'Jon', 'Foster', 'resembling', 'very', 'young', 'Ryan', ""O'Neal"", 'help', 'editing', 'next', 'book', 'Eddie', 'immediately', 'lust', 'Marion', 'who', 'subsequently', 'minimal', 'effort', 'who', 'Eddie', 'reckoning', 'coitus', '60', 'times', 'film', 'end.THE', 'DOOR', 'IN', 'THE', 'FLOOR', 'manipulation', 'theme', 'Ted', 'Marion', 'manipulate', 'Eddie', 'other', 'Eddie', 'innocent', 'party', 'here', 'could', 'be', 'argued', 'sleeping', 'man', 'wife', ""n't"", 'blameless', 'part', 'Ted', 'custody', 'Ruth', 'troubled', 'marriage', 'divorce', 'Eddie', 'who', 'oldest', 'dead', 'son', 'knowing', 'attraction', ""'ll"", 'have', 'Marion', 'vice', 'versa', 'Ted', 'Marion', 'have', 'affair', 'boy', 'thus', 'rendering', 'judicially', 'unfit', 'be', 'guardian', 'other', 'hand', 'Marion', 'freely', 'having', 'Ruth', 'was', 'mistake', 'perhaps', ""n't"", 'want', 'custody', 'anyway', 'seduction', 'Eddie', 'certainly', 'calculated', 'Indeed', 'out', 'loud', 'oldest', 'son', 'ever', 'had', 'sex', 'died', 'virginal', 'Eddie', 'former', 'own', 'private', 'Sex', 'Ed', 'class.This', 'film', 'superficial', 'resemblance', '2004', 'CLOSER', 'adults', 'assaulting', 'one', 'using', 'sex', 'weapon', 'emotional', 'violence', 'latter', 'more', 'spontaneous', 'heated', 'here', 'coldly', 'calculated', 'dramatic', 'tone', 'better', 'maintained', 'CLOSER', 'however', 'DOOR', 'IN', 'THE', 'FLOOR', 'slapstick', 'sequence', 'wherein', 'Ted', 'current', 'mistress', 'first', 'carving', 'knife', 'SUV', 'audience', 'comic', 'relief', 'film', 'consistency', 'reason', ""'m"", 'subtracting', 'star.Ted', 'Marion', 'are', 'two', 'world-wise', 'grown-ups', 'emotionally', 'exhausted', 'other', 'probing', 'limits', 'residual', 'relationship', 'seeking', 'justification', 'ultimate', 'break-up', 'Eddie', 'means', 'end', ""'m"", 'not', 'avid', 'fan', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'enough', 'screen', 'characters', 'suggest', 'perhaps', 'most', 'complex', 'nuanced', 'role', 'date', 'performance', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Bassinger', 'Marion', 'perhaps', 'too', 'controlled', 'character', 'provide', 'substrate', 'great', 'dramatic', 'performance', '51', 'Kim', 'still', 'Hot', 'Babe', 'enough']",N/A

I've never read the book, but I can barely begin to explain how much I liked this movie. It is a very sad film and is very unique. I watchd the documentary on the DVd where Irving talked about the book and personally (even though i've never read the book) I think this portion is all that needs to be a movie.This movie entranced me in a way that most movies don't. The performances,ALL the performances are great.Kim Basinger in my oppinion gives the very best performance.The pain she expresses in the movie seems real. This is in my oppinion,an Oscar worth performance. As for Jeff Bridges,he also gives a stunning performance. I've not seen a lot of Jeff Bridges movies, I haven't even seen ""Seabiscuit"",""but this film does feature the best performances of the year.The movie,which is stunningly written, is about Ted Cole (Bridges). Ted is a childrens author who writes disturbing stuff that is almost funny in how sickly twisted it is. He lives with his wife Marion (Basinger) and his daughter Ruth (Elle Fanning,who I think is related to Dakota Fanning). Marion is asically an empty shell. Their two sons are dead and Marion is still suffering from it, to such an extent she is not even able to express love for her daughter. Ted has grown tired of this so he suggests a summer separation. A very weird idea,involves them alternating when they stay at the house and when they stay at some apartment. For the summer,Ted hires young Eddie (Jon Foster)as a writing assistant. Eddie falls in love with Marion, and begins masturbating to her clothes and such.Eventually Eddie andMarion begin an affair, which Ted both encourages but also resents. The film which is truly a sad film features some hidden jokes. Like a scene where Ruth wakes up crying and Ted tries to find out whats wrong. Marion and Eddie eventually come in and this is what happens:Marion:What's wrong?Ted: She heard banging noises.Marion:What kind of...banging noises?The ending which is the type of ending I would typically hated, is weirdly perfect.

A selfish arrogant author seperates from his selfish clueless wife who has begins sleeping with a selfish and naive college student.  All of the characters are exquisitely self-absorbed and the ultimate victim is the couple's young daughter whom they have no thought or concern for.  Wouldn't be a bad movie if there were some sort of point to it.  No, there are no lessons, no insight, no growth...just pure solipsistic nihilism foisted upon the viewer.  Its as if the author didn't really see any problem with the characters' behavior...somehow the loss of two other children is supposed to give insight into their actions. If that were all, it might make for a mildly interesting excersise in voyeurism.  The real crime, however, isn't the narcissistic characters, its the painfully boring pacing, characterization, and plot.

621889,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00005JMU1,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[7, 10]","The title alludes to a book created by Ted Coles (Jeff Bridges), an artist and writer, which tells a tale for children in regards to a woman that has a child and secretive door in the floor.  The door is not to be opened under any circumstances, but can one ask such a thing from an innocently curious child?The Coles' live in a prolonged twilight of sorrow, as the wife, Marion (Kim Basinger), does not seem able to cope the loss their two teenage sons.  The husband, Ted, seems to be the only one who provides love and care for the daughter, Ruth (Elle Fanning), while Marion struggles internally.  Ruth desires her mother's affection, however, through her father she has learned that she is suffering.  This is explained through lengthy nighttime conversations between Ruth and her father while they look at old photos of her two deceased brothers.In the beginning of the film, Ted receives a letter that inquires if he needs an assistant.  A student, Eddie O'Hare (Jon Foster), from the prestigious boarding school Exeter where the Coles' two sons once attended, desires to become a writer and wants to do an assistantship to learn the tool of the trade.  Amidst this difficult time Ted wants to separate from Marion.  Eddie is forced to face difficult issues of the Coles' and awkwardly he fumbles in the emotional disarray to which he has arrived.  Ted on the other hand requires a driver, as he has recently lost his drivers license and Eddie is this license.The melancholic atmosphere that director Tod Williams generates remains hanging throughout the film, which provides insight to how Marion might feel.  This is a very crucial part of the film, as she seems to shut herself as tightly as a clam.  Despite Marion's difficulty to express how she feels, it becomes painfully evident how she might be feeling through Kim Basinger's excellent performance and the cinematography that captures the cold environment.  Short, interrupted, and meaningless dialogues provide further notions to the introverted sorrow that remains in the air, which leaves the audience in an emotional no man's land.Eddie surrenders to this melancholic atmosphere, as he has a very difficult time finding something to hold on to while spending his summer on this Atlantic seaside island.  Other teens seem to get along while Eddie remains an outsider.  The socioeconomic status of Eddie seems to build boundaries between him and the other teens on the island, as he could only have attended Exeter through his father who is a teacher at the school.  In Eddie's search for someone he discovers the beauty of Marion, whom he secretively pursues.There is a strong sense of detachment among the characters that furthers the melancholy, yet all that are involved long for closeness and tender affection.  However, this affection is different when the audience examines the adults, Ted and Marion, compared to the warmth that Ruth and Eddie desire.  The adults seem to have been severely hurt by something in the past while the two younger characters innocently wander in the presence of the adults trying to find a way into their lives.  Ted escapes reality through his art and an erotically loaded relationship with a woman who models for him, yet it does not provide what he seeks.  Suffering and sorrow cut Marion off from her family, as she dwells on her painful memories deep within herself.  This generates a silence between all parties, which Ruth and Eddie attempt to crack due to their innocence to the cruelties of the world.Door in the Floor illustrates all the visual details in a relationship between a few individuals and what keeps them apart.  Iciness and self-loathing breaks any possibility for affectionate connection between individuals, yet within this detached environment affections thrives when innocence breaks the self-contempt.  This notion is visually symbolized through the seasonally cold summer where leaves and flowers insist on remaining in hiding.  Williams' tale of bereavement and culminating grief brings a heartfelt experience to the audience that will follow the suffering to the end.",4,A Heartfelt Cinematic Experience...,1110844800,"03 15, 2005",2005,4102,"['title', 'book', 'created', 'Ted', 'Coles', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'artist', 'writer', 'tale', 'children', 'regards', 'woman', 'child', 'secretive', 'door', 'floor', 'door', 'not', 'be', 'opened', 'circumstances', 'can', 'one', 'ask', 'thing', 'innocently', 'curious', 'child', 'Coles', 'live', 'prolonged', 'twilight', 'sorrow', 'wife', 'Marion', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'not', 'seem', 'able', 'cope', 'loss', 'two', 'teenage', 'sons', 'husband', 'Ted', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'love', 'care', 'daughter', 'Ruth', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'Marion', 'internally', 'Ruth', 'mother', 'affection', 'however', 'father', 'learned', 'suffering', 'explained', 'lengthy', 'nighttime', 'conversations', 'Ruth', 'father', 'look', 'old', 'photos', 'two', 'deceased', 'beginning', 'film', 'Ted', 'letter', 'assistant', 'student', 'Eddie', ""O'Hare"", 'Jon', 'Foster', 'prestigious', 'boarding', 'school', 'Exeter', 'where', 'Coles', 'two', 'sons', 'once', 'attended', 'become', 'writer', 'do', 'assistantship', 'learn', 'tool', 'trade', 'Amidst', 'difficult', 'time', 'Ted', 'separate', 'Marion', 'Eddie', 'forced', 'face', 'difficult', 'issues', 'Coles', 'awkwardly', 'emotional', 'disarray', 'arrived', 'Ted', 'other', 'hand', 'driver', 'recently', 'lost', 'drivers', 'license', 'Eddie', 'license.The', 'melancholic', 'atmosphere', 'director', 'Tod', 'Williams', 'hanging', 'film', 'insight', 'how', 'Marion', 'might', 'feel', 'very', 'crucial', 'part', 'film', 'shut', 'as', 'tightly', 'clam', 'Marion', 'difficulty', 'express', 'how', 'painfully', 'evident', 'how', 'might', 'be', 'feeling', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'excellent', 'performance', 'cinematography', 'cold', 'environment', 'Short', 'interrupted', 'meaningless', 'dialogues', 'provide', 'further', 'notions', 'introverted', 'sorrow', 'air', 'audience', 'emotional', 'man', 'land.Eddie', 'surrenders', 'melancholic', 'atmosphere', 'very', 'difficult', 'time', 'finding', 'something', 'hold', 'spending', 'summer', 'Atlantic', 'seaside', 'island', 'Other', 'teens', 'seem', 'get', 'along', 'Eddie', 'outsider', 'socioeconomic', 'status', 'Eddie', 'build', 'boundaries', 'other', 'teens', 'island', 'could', 'only', 'have', 'attended', 'Exeter', 'father', 'who', 'teacher', 'school', 'Eddie', 'search', 'someone', 'beauty', 'Marion', 'whom', 'secretively', 'strong', 'sense', 'detachment', 'characters', 'melancholy', 'yet', 'are', 'involved', 'long', 'closeness', 'tender', 'affection', 'However', 'affection', 'different', 'when', 'audience', 'adults', 'Ted', 'Marion', 'compared', 'warmth', 'Ruth', 'Eddie', 'desire', 'adults', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'severely', 'hurt', 'something', 'past', 'two', 'younger', 'characters', 'innocently', 'wander', 'presence', 'adults', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'lives', 'Ted', 'reality', 'art', 'erotically', 'loaded', 'relationship', 'woman', 'who', 'models', 'yet', 'not', 'provide', 'what', 'Suffering', 'sorrow', 'cut', 'Marion', 'family', 'painful', 'memories', 'deep', 'silence', 'parties', 'Ruth', 'Eddie', 'attempt', 'crack', 'due', 'innocence', 'cruelties', 'world.Door', 'Floor', 'visual', 'details', 'relationship', 'few', 'individuals', 'what', 'apart', 'Iciness', 'self-loathing', 'breaks', 'possibility', 'affectionate', 'connection', 'individuals', 'yet', 'detached', 'environment', 'affections', 'thrives', 'when', 'innocence', 'self-contempt', 'notion', 'visually', 'symbolized', 'seasonally', 'cold', 'summer', 'where', 'leaves', 'flowers', 'insist', 'remaining', 'hiding', 'Williams', 'tale', 'bereavement', 'culminating', 'grief', 'brings', 'heartfelt', 'experience', 'audience', 'will', 'follow', 'suffering', 'end']",N/A

I had never heard of the John Irving novel on which it was based.  So, I started out with a clean slate and with no expectations whatsover.The first fifteen minutes of this movie did not enthrall me in any particular way.  I wasn't sure if the characters would be interesting to live with or not.  But I wanted to be patient.  I just waited and watched.Very gradually, I began to wake up to the subtle and twisted dynamics that were unfolding between the three main characters.  I slowly become aware of the unfathomable depths of pain that the long-married and long-suffering couple (Jeff Bridges and Kim Basinger) were experiencing.  I learned that the newcomer, a handsome 16 year-old boy (Jon Foster), was actually a sexual gift from one spouse to the other.  I was very surprised. I was very intrigued.There are many sexual encounters presented in this story.  Some people might see this as a ""bawdy"" escapade, but it isn't that type of movie at all.  This is a film that is concerned with the infliction of pain upon the human soul and the crazy, weird attempts that human beings make to cope with the pain and to possibly heal from it.  All in all, this is a hopeful story.  It is also a helpful story.  We can learn something from it.  We might be able to help ourselves heal someday.The acting in this film is at Academy Award levels.  The Long Island summer scenery is poignant and elegant.

His caracter is witty, charming, and comical, while enduring the slow death of his marriage, and his unyielding love for his daughter, along with his struggle to write his next childrens novel. The plot has already been hatced over, so I wont bore you with it. You should know that the author of the book this film was base on, actually served as an advisor in making the film, which gives it credibility.  The direction is excellent, the acting impressive, especially that of the daughter, who turned 5 while making this film.  One sideline I should note here that some may not appreciate is the ageless grace the characters seem to have.  Bridges, Basinger, and Mimi Rogers, are not young teen actors anymore,  but even the nude scenes show a mature grace and attractiveness that many films would exploit in a vulgar way.

621892,A2T049UQONS0OY,B00005JMU1,Larry VanDeSande,"[6, 10]","This is a movie full of losers that is plaintively based on someone's novel that is a mimic of the 1980 film, ""Ordinary People"". It is the only relationship to the movie that won four Oscars two and a half decades ago, however. That movie had perspective and related family dynamics that could actually happen. It's a stark contrast to this film, which is more fantasy than reality.In a nutshell, it's a flick about a marriage breaking apart because of infidelity and tragedy. There are many undercurrents in the plot that seem to indicate other things got in the way. But, by way of the action, it is the inappropriate activities of the lead actors that cause their demise.I had a good laugh at the Amazon.com description that said, ""Jeff Bridges demonstrates once again that he is one of the finest actors in film."" That's funny, ranking Bridges up there with Daniel Day-Lewis, Robert DeNiro and Dustin Hoffman!Bridges is the same in this movie that he has been in his better efforts (including ""White Squall"" and ""Tucker""). He is good five by five wide and not so good five by five deep. In other words, he is effective within the constraints of playing Jeff Bridges as a leading man. When it comes to acting out a convincing role as a method actor, he is no good.The cliches in this flick are many and not varied. Bridges is a writer-artist wit peculiar habits (Cliche No. 1); his wife (Kim Basinger) is a damaged woman seeking companionship elsewhere after a family tragedy (Cliche No. 2); enter Bridges' new ""assistant"", a young college boy that ... Guess what?! ... is going to fulfill some of the interest Bridges more and more estranged wife needs (Cliche No. 3). Their daughter seems to be the only one centered in reality (Cliche No. 4).With these cliches in hand, this film moves in a decidedly ugly and desperate direction. The main male is perverse and thinks he is a great father. The principal female is unattractive and about as convincing an actor as Male No. 1. The college boy adds some flash doesn't do anything to save No. 1 or No. 2. The other actors do little to help, either, except possibly for Mimi Rogers' full frontal nude scene. I guess that was to show she is still a sexpot in advancing age.I'd like to say something better about this film but, the longer it went on, the uglier it got. There is no reason to feel sorry for anyone in the cast, nor is there any reason to have any optimism for anybody. Finally, near the end, something good happens to the most inconsequential cast memeber, a handyman, but it's a case of way too little far too late.If you want to be confused, depressed and sullen over the situations of some people that are rich, successful, living glamorously and still can't keep it together, then rent this movie.",3,Everyone loses in this one,1121990400,"07 22, 2005",2005,2766,"['movie', 'full', 'losers', 'plaintively', 'based', 'someone', 'novel', 'mimic', '1980', 'film', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'only', 'relationship', 'movie', 'won', 'four', 'Oscars', 'two', 'half', 'decades', 'ago', 'however', 'movie', 'had', 'perspective', 'related', 'family', 'dynamics', 'could', 'actually', 'happen', 'stark', 'contrast', 'film', 'more', 'fantasy', 'reality.In', 'nutshell', 'flick', 'marriage', 'breaking', 'apart', 'infidelity', 'tragedy', 'are', 'many', 'undercurrents', 'plot', 'seem', 'indicate', 'other', 'things', 'got', 'way', 'way', 'action', 'inappropriate', 'activities', 'lead', 'actors', 'cause', 'demise.I', 'had', 'good', 'laugh', 'Amazon.com', 'description', 'said', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'once', 'again', 'one', 'finest', 'actors', 'film', 'funny', 'ranking', 'Bridges', 'up', 'there', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Bridges', 'same', 'movie', 'been', 'better', 'efforts', 'including', 'White', 'Squall', 'Tucker', 'good', 'five', 'five', 'wide', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'five', 'five', 'deep', 'other', 'words', 'effective', 'constraints', 'playing', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'leading', 'man', 'When', 'acting', 'out', 'convincing', 'role', 'method', 'actor', 'good.The', 'cliches', 'flick', 'are', 'many', 'not', 'varied', 'Bridges', 'writer-artist', 'wit', 'peculiar', 'habits', 'Cliche', 'No', '1', 'wife', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'damaged', 'woman', 'seeking', 'companionship', 'elsewhere', 'family', 'tragedy', 'Cliche', 'No', '2', 'Bridges', 'new', 'assistant', 'young', 'college', 'boy', 'Guess', 'what', 'going', 'fulfill', 'interest', 'Bridges', 'more', 'more', 'estranged', 'wife', 'needs', 'Cliche', 'No', '3', 'daughter', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'centered', 'reality', 'Cliche', 'No', '4', 'cliches', 'hand', 'film', 'decidedly', 'ugly', 'desperate', 'direction', 'main', 'male', 'perverse', 'great', 'father', 'principal', 'female', 'unattractive', 'convincing', 'actor', 'Male', 'No', '1', 'college', 'boy', 'flash', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'save', 'No', '1', 'No', '2', 'other', 'actors', 'do', 'little', 'help', 'either', 'possibly', 'Mimi', 'Rogers', 'full', 'frontal', 'nude', 'scene', 'guess', 'was', 'show', 'still', 'sexpot', 'advancing', 'age.I', ""'d"", 'like', 'say', 'something', 'better', 'film', 'longer', 'went', 'uglier', 'got', 'reason', 'feel', 'sorry', 'anyone', 'cast', 'there', 'reason', 'have', 'optimism', 'anybody', 'Finally', 'end', 'something', 'good', 'happens', 'most', 'inconsequential', 'cast', 'memeber', 'handyman', 'case', 'way', 'too', 'little', 'far', 'too', 'late.If', 'want', 'be', 'confused', 'depressed', 'sullen', 'situations', 'people', 'are', 'rich', 'successful', 'living', 'glamorously', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'together', 'then', 'rent', 'movie']",N/A
621893,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JMU1,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[77, 87]","John Irving's ""A Prayer for Owen Meany"" is my favorite contemporary novel, and it was clear when I read the book that it would never be made into a movie because the title character could never survive the transition.  Indeed, all writer-director Mark Steven Johnson could do was be inspired to turn the first chapter of the novel into the film ""Simon Birch.""  Irving himself did the screenplay for ""The Cider Holes Rules"" and had to condense and restructure the story to come up with a movie version.  Even ""The World According to Garp,"" which captures the high points of the comic novel, leaves out so much of the depth and detail.  Of course, this is true of any adaptation of a novel.  Things are always added and subtracted, changed and replaced, with any novel, but it seems that with Irving's novels filmmakers are painfully aware of the difficulties.Such was the case with ""A Widow for One Year,"" and writer-director Tod Williams gives himself a fighting chance by restricting himself to the first third of the novel in ""The Door in the Floor.""  In doing so he at least creates a new market for the novel, since there is most of the story of these four people to be told.  The situation is that Ted Cole (Jeff Bridges), who writes and illustrates stories for children, decides to hire an assistant for the summer, and hires a 16-year-old Exeter student, Eddie O'Hare (Jon Foster), who wants to be a writer when he grows up.  The Cole family consists of wife Marion (Kim Basinger), their four-year-old daughter, Ruth (Elle Fanning), and the dozens of photographs on the wall of Tom and Tim, the two sons who died when they were teenagers.Eddie does not know that he has walked into on going tragedy until it is way too late.  Marion takes Eddie to bed, not just because Ted no longer touches her and the boy becoming a man has a crush on her, but because Ted wants to build a swimming pool.  Ted and Marion have decided that the pain they feel needs to be inflicted on the other, but the tacit agreement is that they will not do it directly.  If you pay attention, there are only a few scenes in which Marion and Ted appear together: Eddie becomes their go between, even when there are not any explicit messages.  Eddie is the final nail in the coffin of this marriage, although only one of the three realizes this first and uses it to their advantage.Although hired to help Ted, who needs to be driven around because he has lost his license, Eddie realizes he is there more for Marion and Ruth.  For the little girl the most important thing in the world are the pictures of Tom and Tim on the walls.  Each one has a story, and pity the poor nanny who does not know the story behind a particular photography.  Ruth knows the stories by heart, but she likes to hear them being told to her again (and again).  Ted thinks that Marion's indiscretions mean he can win guardianship of Ruth when the inevitable divorce happens, but never realizes he is playing the wrong game here.When you see Basinger and Foster together their sexual relationship seems too hard to accept, but this would not be a problem if Williams did not choose to show us some of their more intimate moments.  This is a mistake, not just because you are suddenly doing the math on the age difference between the actress and actor, but more importantly because the importance of the relationship is best seen from Ted's perspective.  He never sees it (although Ruth does), but he knows about it and is bent on using that fact to his advantage.  Both Basinger and Bridges bring an economy to their characters that brings a sharpness to their pain; for her it is the dead look in her eyes, for him it is the sound of what is missing in his voice.""The Door in the Floor"" is more forgiving of both Ted and Marion than the novel is by the end of that first section.  Ted does not simply have affairs, but engages in calculated seductions using his talent and reputation.  His current conquest, Evelyn Vaughn (Mimi Rogers), is in the final stages of the sordid relationship, where degradation becomes the name of the game.  But Williams uses the sequence where Evelyn tries to take her revenge as the most comic moment in the film, and reduces his despicable treatment of the woman to a joke on a windshield.  The film's sympathies are clearly with Marion, who is reduced to catatonia by thoughts of her dead sons.  When she comes to her decision as to what is to be done, we believe it is the right one, even though the consequences are going to be devastating.  But then Williams mutes the impact considerably.As someone who read ""A Widow for One Year,"" watching ""The Door in the Floor"" certainly hit the high points and brought back vivid memories of the best parts of the novel.

621896,A2TBMX78M7PD5T,B00005JMU1,"Malvolio ""scott15724""","[17, 21]","The Door in the Floor is a film adaptation of part of John Irving's novel A Widow For One Year. It relates one summer in the lives of Ted Cole (Jeff Bridges), a writer of children's books; his wife Marion (Kim Basinger) and their four-year-old daughter Ruth (Elle Fanning); and Eddie O'Hare (Jon Foster), a prep school student and would-be writer who comes to intern with Ted. Marion and Ted are a long-married couple whose relationship foundered when their teenage boys were killed in a car accident. It also doesn't help that Ted is an aggressive philanderer who specializes in going after mother/daughter pairs. By the time Eddie arrives, at the start of the film, Ted and Marion are gingerly working out a trial separation.Though much of the film's action is seen through Eddie's eyes, it is clear from the outset that The Door in the Floor is Jeff Bridges' movie. His embodiment of Ted is unerringly right, through all the character's shifts from breeziness to pompous false modesty to querulousness and bluster. Studiedly scruffy and yet charming, he is solicitous to Marion, raffish with numerous female admirers, and a devoted (if unconventional) father. His range is so effortless as to seem completely artless.The other performers pale by comparison - partly, one suspects, because the script gives them less fleshed-out characters to play. The film's most tragic character, Marion is a lost soul since the death of her sons, wandering through life with melancholy inattention. Eddie's appearance revives her slightly, but at the film's end, though she rouses herself to act, one suspects that the act will bring her no solace. It seems like Kim Basinger could give even the wooden Mrs. Cole a little more winsomeness. But that's a quibble; she fulfills the demands of the script well enough.Jon Foster's monochromatic earnestness as Eddie is a bigger problem for the film. When he arrives at the Coles' place, Eddie finds that life as Ted's intern is hardly educational - at least, in any of the ways he would expect. His primary occupations involve re-typing miniscule corrections in Ted's stories, entertaining Ruth, and chauffering Ted to his various social commitments and liaisons. (Ted has lost his driver's license to a DUI conviction.) Of course, since this is partly Eddie's coming-of-age saga, he also embarks on a summer-long affair with Marion, leading to lots of interesting complications with Ted, as well as one hilarious episode involving Ruth. In all of this, it seems there would be plenty of grist for humor, mortification, and mischief in Foster's portrayal of the young intern. Unfortunately, he gets no further than his initial earnestness, unless you count a late foray into peevishness. By the end of the film, Eddie is just as much a cipher as he was when he arrived.Outside of Bridges', the most pungent portrayals in the movie come from minor characters: Mimi Rogers, wonderfully volatile as one of Ted's conquests; and Louis Arcella as her longsuffering gardener.In the end, The Door in the Floor is a good movie, worth the entry fee and an evening's time. Director Tod Williams imbues his tale with sufficient emotional depth, humor, and human familiarity to make us care about these people and their misadventures. But with a little stronger script, and performances from the other principles to match Mr. Bridges', it could have been very special indeed.A word about the title, by the way. The film takes its name from one of Ted's children's books, and it is an image that takes on more and more resonance as the story proceeds. It is only in the last moments of the movie, though, that ""the door in the floor"" takes on its final, unexpected and rather wonderful meaning.

This is a true adult film if there ever was one, full of wonderful, complicated, and real characters going through true everyday emotions that anyone can relate to.Alternately tragic and comic, the film is an exploration of the complexities of love in both its brightest and darkest moments. Adapted from the first half of John Irving's best-selling novel 'A Widow for One Year,' the film is set in the privileged beach community of East Hampton, New York and chronicles one pivotal summer in the lives of famous children's book author Ted Cole (an Oscar-worthy performance by Jeff Bridges) and his beautiful wife Marion (Kim Basinger reminding us once again why she IS an Oscar-nominated actress). The couple's once-wonderful marriage has been strained by a family tragedy and neither one is or will ever be the same again.Marion's resulting depression and Ted's subsequent infidelities have prevented the couple from facing a much-needed change in their relationship. They aren't divorced but they don't like together anymore either, taking turns staying in the house to care for their daughter (played by the adorable Elle Fanning, Dakota's sister). Then, Ted hires Eddie O'Hare, a 16 year old who wants to be a writer, to work as his summer assistant, changing the couple's lives forever. The boy becomes the couple's unwitting yet willing pawn - and, ultimately, becomes the catalyst in the transformation of their lives.The Door in the Floor is a film of deep, devastating power - a film where you, as an audience member, actually share space with its two main characters. We inhabit their crumbled world, from the inside, not just as observers. By the end, we feel as if we have gone through their tragedy with them, and when I left the theatre, I felt as if my life had been changed by sharing with them what I just shared - as if time itself had stopped and left me suspended in there, with them.The entire cast is very convincing and the film sparkles with dynamic performances. At first I felt Mimi Rogers was wasted in her almost silent role, but she has one of the most memorable scenes in the film, which came toward the end, and truly delivers a wonderful comedic portrayal. Elle Fanning amazed me. She is a gifted young talent and I look forward to seeing more of her. Like her sister Dakota, she did everything right. Jon Foster as Eddie is terrific, bringing out his character's innocence and confusion, and Bijou Phillips was great in her very small role.The film is very explicit, but for anyone with an open mind and an open heart, it is THE film to see this summer.

621902,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00005JMU1,mirasreviews,"[8, 10]","""The Door in the Floor"" has been adapted from the first third of John Irving's novel ""A Widow for a Year"". Screenwriter and director Tod Williams has chosen to dramatize one act of the novel, which seems a perfect story in itself, and has moved the story to the present day. Ted Cole (Jeff Bridges) is a novelist and successful author of children's books. He and his wife Marion (Kim Basinger) share a home in the Hamptons that has become a shrine to their teenaged sons, who died a few years previously. Marion is still paralyzed by grief, overcome with the loss of her sons, and unable or unwilling to care for the couple's young daughter Ruth (Elle Fanning). Ted copes by drinking and philandering. In need of a driver, he hires Eddie (Jon Foster), an aspiring young writer from Exeter Academy, as his assistant for the summer. Eddie's presence awakens the maternal and sexual instincts in Marion, and they have an affair -with results that Ted did not anticipate.Every year, there are a few good character dramas. I give them favorable reviews and then forget about them. I just don't get very excited about relationship stories. But ""The Door in the Floor"" astonished me. I don't think I've ever seen a more affecting drama of loss and love. The Cole's loss and their love for their children seem very real, which is rare. And nothing can overcome the repercussions of that loss. There isn't any melodrama. The characters are dysfunctional and unlikable in some ways, but actually not as neurotic as I've come to expect in modern drama. They know themselves and each other very well. They understand their situation, yet they can't change it. Marion Cole is the first really good performance I've seen from Kim Basinger. I used to think she couldn't act; now I wonder why hasn't until now. Jeff Bridges is always superb, and he makes Ted Cole's alcoholic, lecherous behavior sympathetic. His pompous, self-satisfied delivery is extraordinary in how it wounds and, at the same time, generates pathos. Jon Foster's Eddie is simultaneously innocent and perceptive.Although ""The Door in the Floor"" is about people in emotionally desperate circumstances, the film has a great sense of humor. There are several scenes so funny that they are sure to provoke explosions of laughter. Both John Irving and Tod Williams see absurdity even in life's tragedies. Ted, Marion, and Eddie's needs and emotions are often expressed sexually, and this is one of the few films for which I think showing the sex is essential, since Marion and Eddie's characters evolve through their physical relationship. We wouldn't understand Marion's anguish or her awakening without the bedroom scenes. Williams' ability to seamlessly integrate sex scenes without altering the film's tone or pace is impressive and unusual. And he has perfectly balanced the drama with comedy, just as he achieved the perfect quiet tone for the film. I really can't compliment director Tod Williams enough on making a impeccably paced, beautiful, and thought-provoking film about interesting, flawed, but heartrending people in an impossible situation. Highly recommended.The DVD: Bonus features include a making-of documentary, an interview with John Irving, ""Anatomy of a Scene"", and an audio commentary. The documentary, ""Frame on the Wall"" (25 minutes), includes interviews with Tod Williams, the cast, and principle crew, who discuss the characters and adapting the novel for the screen. In ""Novel to Screen: John Irving"" (15 minutes), novelist John Irving talks about the differences between the media of literature and film and how and why Tod Williams adapted the novel the way he did. ""Anatomy of a Scene"" (25 minutes), from the Sundance Film Channel, analyzes the scene at Mrs. Vaughn's house, where Ted tries to extricate himself from the relationship and ends up on the run. The audio commentary features 5 members of the film's creative team: writer/director Tod Williams, cinematographer Terry Stacey, editor Affonso Goncalves, composer Marcel Zarvos, and costume designer Eric Daman. The commentary is conversational, but interesting. It is about the technical aspects of the film, not much about the story. ""Frame on the Wall"" and the interview with John Irving are worthwhile sources for discussion of the story and characters. Captioning is available in English, subtitles in French and Spanish, and dubbing is available in French.",5,Utterly Brilliant.

The film wisely makes use of only the best and most interesting narrative in the novel, which is the introductory story. (The novel continues to follow the characters as they age, showing the impact of the early narrative as it reverberates through their lives.)Kim Basinger was probably the perfect actress to cast in this film as Marion, a wife destroyed by the grief of losing her two sons. She is achingly beautiful in her depression. Jeff Bridges is also wonderfully unsettling (and annoying) as Ted, Marion's philandering husband. His unmannered approach is spot-on for the egotistical children's author, who feeds every cute young woman he meets the same tired lines.Eddie (played by Jon Foster), who bears a striking resemblance to one of the dead boys, is hired as Ted's driver for the summer (Ted, an alocoholic, has lost his license.), and he almost immediately develops a strong attraction to Marion. The two begin an affair, and the resulting fall-out ends the marriage of Marion and Ted.I liked this movie. Although it is not a hopeful or pleasant film (there are some very uncomfortable moments, and there is also quite a bit of nudity), it is worth watching for Basinger's nuanced portrayal of a childless mother and Bridges' (often unsympathetic) character work.",4,"Smart adaptation, great performances",1132358400,"11 19, 2005",2005,1411,"['Having', 'read', 'John', 'Irving', 'A', 'Widow', 'One', 'Year', 'film', 'based', 'feel', 'qualified', 'comment', 'Door', 'Floor', 'film', 'wisely', 'use', 'only', 'best', 'most', 'interesting', 'narrative', 'novel', 'introductory', 'story', 'novel', 'follow', 'characters', 'age', 'showing', 'impact', 'early', 'narrative', 'lives', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'was', 'probably', 'perfect', 'actress', 'cast', 'film', 'Marion', 'wife', 'destroyed', 'grief', 'losing', 'two', 'sons', 'achingly', 'beautiful', 'depression', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'also', 'wonderfully', 'unsettling', 'annoying', 'Ted', 'Marion', 'philandering', 'husband', 'unmannered', 'approach', 'spot-on', 'egotistical', 'children', 'author', 'who', 'cute', 'young', 'woman', 'same', 'tired', 'lines.Eddie', 'played', 'Jon', 'Foster', 'who', 'striking', 'resemblance', 'one', 'dead', 'boys', 'hired', 'Ted', 'driver', 'summer', 'Ted', 'alocoholic', 'lost', 'license', 'almost', 'immediately', 'strong', 'attraction', 'Marion', 'two', 'begin', 'affair', 'resulting', 'fall-out', 'marriage', 'Marion', 'Ted.I', 'liked', 'movie', 'not', 'hopeful', 'pleasant', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'moments', 'also', 'quite', 'bit', 'nudity', 'worth', 'watching', 'Basinger', 'nuanced', 'portrayal', 'childless', 'mother', 'Bridges', 'often', 'unsympathetic', 'character', 'work']",N/A

Intertwining myth, tragedy of heroic proportion, the fragility of illusion and appearances, this film gracefully exposes viewers to the depths of our bondage to our self-imposed archetypes. Dissolute Writer, The Lustful Boy, The Wounded Mother, The Spurned Lover.  The walking wounded stumble and fall together in this luminous, beautifully crafted showcase for the acting skills of a stellar cast.I found the most telling scene to be the one in which Eddie, looking up into the face of his lover Marion, sees her face contorted not with the passion of lust but the passion of grief.  Marion's estranged husband Ted later points out to Eddie that he had ""given"" Eddie to her because of his resemblance to one of her dead sons.  Marion herself had revealed the incestuous/cathartic nature of her desire for Eddie when she almost longingly confides in him her certainty/sorrow that this son had died a virgin, then almost in the same breath invites Eddie to lose his virginity to her.  This act consummates her awareness that she must leave behind her enamored lover, her philandering husband, and her small daughter - that it's ""better to be dead"" than to be a poor mother.There was plenty of room for this film to dissolve into cliche'd resolution of conflicts, but instead the story reveals the depth and intelligence and truthfulness of these character's flaws as if peeling away layers of silken veils.  The deft and deep acting skills of the cast are marvelous to behold - it was breathtaking to watch the naturalness of Jeff Bridges as he arises from his bed and walks his tiny daughter back to hers, then stands in the doorway to toss her a few honest thoughts on fear, all the while content in his nudity.  I found myself longing to be that uninhibited.  It was an honor to see the aging actors reveal their characters, line by facial line, to watch the younger actors' romantic, brave, naivte', and yes, thank God for Mimi Rogers showing the desirability, vulnerability, and passion of a mature, healthy woman.There were no ""perfect"" characters, no fluffy endings, nothing Hollywood about this film.

621909,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B00005JMU1,Robert Morris,"[4, 5]","This is the third of three movies I have seen which are based on John Irving's novels, the others being The World According to Garp (1982) and Cider House Rules (1999). In fact, director Tod Williams bases his screenplay on only 30-35% of A Widow for One Year, focussing almost all of his attention on the dysfunctional, rapidly deteriorating marriage of Marion (Kim Basinger) and Ted Cole (Jeff Bridges) rather than on their daughter Ruth as Irving does. An eminently successful author and illustrator of children's books, Ted hires Eddie O'Hare (Jon Foster) into this toxic situation to be his summer intern/administrative assistant. (Sixteen year-old Eddie is a student at Phillips Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire.) When the film begins, the Coles have a four year-old daughter, Ruth (Elle Fanning), and maintain both an apartment in the town of East Hampton and a beach house. Gradually we learn that the Coles had two teenage sons who died in an automobile accident several years ago and that Ted has recently suggested a trial separation, one to which Marion does not object. The quality of acting throughout the cast is first-rate, with especially strong performances provided by Mimi Rogers (Eleanor Vaughn), Louis Arcella (Eduardo Gomez), and Donna Murphy (frame shop owner) in supporting roles. Despite the graphic portrayal of alcoholism, adultery, and grief which have exacerbated Marion's relationship with Ted, there is a strong humorous element within the narrative. For example, when Eleanor's gardner Eduardo responds after she fires him. His act of revenge later results in another amusing situation as Ted returns to the Coles' beachfront home with three admirers.However, as with the other two film adaptations of Irving's novels, this one has some serious flaws which cannot be offset by superior acting and production values. The flaws in the story line(s) and character delineation are best suggested by questions such as these. Why does Marion exploit Eddie's sexual attraction to her, especially given the fact that he reminds her of her beloved older son whose death she continues to mourn? Why does Ted seem to condone (if not encourage) that exploitation? (What would Freud have to say about their coordinated manipulation of Eddie if discussing this film?) Why are both Marion and Ted unwilling and/or unable to provide the emotional support which Ruth so obviously needs? Why do they maintain the gallery of prominently displayed family photos, most of which include their two sons? These are only a few of the questions I have which, for me, the film does not satisfactorily resolve. With regard to the ending and its relevance to the film's title, I offer no comments out of respect to those who have not as yet seen the film. There is much to admire in The Door in the Floor. Although this may be Jeff Bridges' most cohesive performance thus far, I think Kim Basinger faced and then overcame much greater challenges as Marion.If only there were not so much in the film which seems to me thematically contrived and emotionally muddled. Although Eddie and Ruth are the primary victims, the film itself is the ultimate casualty of Williams' and (yes) Irving's predilection for sentimentality and melodrama, especially in those scenes in which such self-indulgences are especially distracting.",3,"Actually, Three and One-Half Stars",1090368000,"07 21, 2004",2004,3323,"['third', 'three', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'are', 'based', 'John', 'Irving', 'novels', 'others', 'being', 'World', 'According', 'Garp', '1982', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', '1999', 'fact', 'director', 'Tod', 'Williams', 'screenplay', 'only', '30-35', '%', 'A', 'Widow', 'One', 'Year', 'focussing', 'almost', 'attention', 'dysfunctional', 'rapidly', 'deteriorating', 'marriage', 'Marion', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'Ted', 'Cole', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'rather', 'daughter', 'Ruth', 'Irving', 'eminently', 'successful', 'author', 'illustrator', 'children', 'books', 'Ted', 'Eddie', ""O'Hare"", 'Jon', 'Foster', 'toxic', 'situation', 'be', 'summer', 'intern/administrative', 'assistant', 'Sixteen', 'year-old', 'Eddie', 'student', 'Phillips', 'Academy', 'Exeter', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'When', 'film', 'Coles', 'have', 'four', 'year-old', 'daughter', 'Ruth', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'maintain', 'apartment', 'town', 'East', 'Hampton', 'beach', 'house', 'Gradually', 'learn', 'Coles', 'had', 'two', 'teenage', 'sons', 'who', 'died', 'automobile', 'accident', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'Ted', 'recently', 'suggested', 'trial', 'separation', 'one', 'Marion', 'not', 'object', 'quality', 'acting', 'cast', 'first-rate', 'especially', 'strong', 'performances', 'provided', 'Mimi', 'Rogers', 'Eleanor', 'Vaughn', 'Louis', 'Arcella', 'Eduardo', 'Gomez', 'Donna', 'Murphy', 'frame', 'shop', 'owner', 'supporting', 'roles', 'graphic', 'portrayal', 'alcoholism', 'adultery', 'grief', 'have', 'exacerbated', 'Marion', 'relationship', 'Ted', 'strong', 'humorous', 'element', 'narrative', 'example', 'when', 'Eleanor', 'gardner', 'Eduardo', 'act', 'revenge', 'later', 'results', 'amusing', 'situation', 'Ted', 'Coles', 'beachfront', 'home', 'three', 'admirers.However', 'other', 'two', 'film', 'adaptations', 'Irving', 'novels', 'one', 'serious', 'flaws', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'offset', 'superior', 'acting', 'production', 'values', 'flaws', 'story', 'line', 's', 'character', 'delineation', 'are', 'best', 'suggested', 'questions', 'such', 'Why', 'Marion', 'exploit', 'Eddie', 'sexual', 'attraction', 'especially', 'given', 'fact', 'beloved', 'older', 'son', 'death', 'mourn', 'Why', 'Ted', 'seem', 'condone', 'not', 'encourage', 'exploitation', 'What', 'would', 'Freud', 'have', 'say', 'coordinated', 'manipulation', 'Eddie', 'discussing', 'film', 'Why', 'are', 'Marion', 'Ted', 'unwilling', 'and/or', 'unable', 'provide', 'emotional', 'support', 'Ruth', 'so', 'obviously', 'Why', 'do', 'maintain', 'gallery', 'prominently', 'displayed', 'family', 'photos', 'most', 'include', 'two', 'sons', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'questions', 'have', 'film', 'not', 'satisfactorily', 'resolve', 'regard', 'ending', 'relevance', 'film', 'title', 'offer', 'comments', 'respect', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'film', 'much', 'admire', 'Door', 'Floor', 'may', 'be', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'most', 'cohesive', 'performance', 'thus', 'far', 'think', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'faced', 'then', 'overcame', 'much', 'greater', 'challenges', 'Marion.If', 'only', 'were', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'thematically', 'contrived', 'emotionally', 'muddled', 'Eddie', 'Ruth', 'are', 'primary', 'victims', 'film', 'ultimate', 'casualty', 'Williams', 'yes', 'Irving', 'predilection', 'sentimentality', 'melodrama', 'especially', 'scenes', 'such', 'self-indulgences', 'are', 'especially', 'distracting']",N/A

We hear this statement three or four times throughout the film The Door in the Floor. But the character of Ted Cole is someone much more.We open to an out-of-focus shot where Ruth (Elle Fanning), the little girl of the Cole family, carries a chair through the hallway to look at the typical wall of photographs. It is filmed carefully in a very wide shot. She performs this scene in a graceful manner so that we are introduced to the masterful subtlety of the first act of this film--how it is more of a nuance and less of a forceful film. That is just one example of many of the particularly inspired scenes scattered throughout this well-crafted, scrupulously assembled film. The Door in the Floor is a painting made with moving images, and it is a very touching--yet slightly flawed--piece of art all at once. Not one performance is really forced, though. And that's its strong point.It's a film like someone is trying not to make a film (okay that was corny, but if you've seen the film, you know what I mean). The screenwriter wishes to tell a story stripped of the prescribed pretenses that so many mainstream movies feature these days.Jeff Bridges and Kim Basinger are well cast as the stereotypically failing couple of Ted and Marion Cole. They are the parents of Ruth, and continue to grieve the loss of their two deceased sons. Marion is more disturbed by the accident than her husband, who plays it off to retain his sanity. They're basically bored with one another and need a change--trial separation comes to mind. The Coles have two houses, and each spouse switches to have time with their only daughter, who is around four or fives year old, and avoid each other at the same time. They're trying to be good parents, and yet at the same time, they lack the effort and motivation to inhabit the parent role. Two very self-centered, yet realistic, characters in a way.But in comes Eddie (Jon Foster of life as we know it), who will literally turn the Cole family upside down. Ted hires him as an assistant, but he's more than that--he is the catalyst of their breakdown. He resembles one of the dead sons, and he hopes that he can give one of the boys back to Marion. Ted truly does this for his own selfish reasons so that she will divorce him and he can continue to sleep with every woman on the island for the rest of his life.The Coles are creatures of habit. They seldom stray outside the restrictions of their daily routine--Ted writes, paints nudes of Mrs. Vaughn (Mimi Rogers), and plays squash while Marion mopes in self-pity and goes to the beach and the cinema on occasion. Each character is well-fleshed out in that way so that by the end, we can perhaps understand each of their actions and sympathize with them while hating them all at once. How can you not hate these people?! Eddie is completely infatuated with Marion, and at one point, she catches him masturbating to her clothes (arranged in an almost comic fashion). That scene is particularly awkward, and we as the audience feel what Eddie is feeling, and how Marion must be reacting to this. This scene is great, although there still exist some especially sporadic ones.Eddie and Marion embark on an intense affair, making love some 60 times over the course of the summer in basically every position that you can imagine (the ""inadequate lampshade"" scene is very funny and disturbing all at once). The sex scenes are awkward, creepy, but well done. We get to see in The Door in the Floor what we never saw in The Graduate--although I doubt that is what writer/director Tod Williams was attempting to do. This affair sparks a chain reaction of strange occurences, catastrophic events, and confrontations within the walls of the Coles house, and some of them are quite brilliant. Although it's a linear story, its characters and their emotions are often nonlinear, which is perhaps closest to human emotion in some sense. The Eddie character, although I admired Foster's performance from a distance, is still kind of inconsistent throughout the borders. In the final act of the film, which stretches to fascinating and disturbing heights, he takes on the persona that I wanted to see him in the first two acts.Jeff Bridges gives his best work to date in this film. There are no screaming, thrashing arguments, no drama-staple scenes where Ted overreaches and you can see the look in his eyes ""please give me an Oscar damnit!"" He simply delivers the dialogue in a masterful, understated, and bittersweet way that only a great American actor can do. I'm with him for the win, all the way.Kim Basinger is almost in top form, although there are too little scenes that feature her doing any kind of performing (besides performing on Eddie) that would merit nomination worthy material. The film's main problem is that it cannot seem to equally balance what a dark comedy needs to have. I think that the film should have been left more as a drama (although its often sardonically funny) and less of a dark comedy. There are little comedic moments arranged throughout The Door (you're just waiting for Bridges to say something along the lines of ""obviously you're not a golfer"" or ""I'm the dude!""), but by the time we reach the moment where the film's course is set to parody and back again, we do not know how to react. The chase scene feels tacked on, and it comes as too much of a surprise and less of the paradox it was meant to be. And Mrs. Vaughn, where Mimi Rogers bears all, is just too underdeveloped to make it really work.The scene where the ""accident"" is described in detail by Ted Cole is unsettling and chilling, as are many moments throughout the film. The performances are, in general, fantastic. Terry Stacey's cinematography is gentle and is the best I've seen all year. Not only does it use a beautiful color palette, but it lets things play out, and focues a lot on the character's surroundings. Their reactions are clear. Everything is very open, especially the moments where the hills are shot exquisitely through the shrouding mist. Marcelo Zarvos has composed an amazingly moving, tear inducing score. There are all these wonderful things working to churn the gears of this movie, and they don't stop. It is mostly the inevitable sinkholes of the tone and story that bring this movie down from its true potential. I still liked it. In fact, I still really liked it. And I love the book, and Tod Williams' film remains quite faithful to the first third of John Irving's best novel A Widow for One Year. I just wish that Ruth, as well depicted by Elle Fanning as she was, was elaborated on a bit more. She was the focus of the original source material. That's all that will come out of the mouth of this book fan.For the most part, this is a very good film that you should not miss. It deserves any acting nominations for its performances. Go ahead and open The Door in the Floor.

When a film needs a cute little blond girl, and Dakota is getting too old, this little sister will, no doubt, be called.Symbolism and innuendos concerning the sons, from the start, added a touch of mystery.

They have a routine to keep four-year-old daughter Ruth (Elle Fanning, who seems to have fallen victim of that rubbed-off stardom syndrome from older sister Dakota) in their lives as much as possible, but the simple fact is Ted is a much better parent; Marion is distracted, depressed, and ""turns to stone"" for hours at a time when thinking about a distressing tragedy that occurred with her sons Tim and Tom, who predeceased Ruth. Enter Eddie (Jon Foster), a seventeen-year-old Exeter student who aspires to be a writer. Ted takes him on as assistant, and the teen falls in love and begins to have an affair with Marion.The story mainly follows this illicit relationship, with Ted more or less on the back burner. The interactions between the characters are great, and Eddie really seems to grow up during his summer apprenticeship, taking care of Ruth - whose performance is particularly striking because of her obsession with old photographs of Tim and Tom, the brothers before her who her mother would never let her forget. And while there isn't so much as a twist at the end, there is a tidbit of information about Marion's affair with Eddie that sheds more light on the notion that if an older woman seeks a relationship with a younger man, there's something off in her life, or maybe even in her mind.THE DOOR IN THE FLOOR (is that metaphor I hear afoot?) is an emotional rollercoaster - often worth a few chuckles, at times very sad, and intriguing throughout its long run.

Two messed-up rich people.If you look close, you may find soft-spots of implausibility in the theme and a tendency to fall for cute, maudlin puffery such as cant-get-along parents mourning an accident, a young person's life changed forever by brief exposure to adult dysfunction, the friction and affection between an older mentor and the devout youngling, etc etc.The narrative has its share of dark moments, some that may make you cringe. The last act becomes unexpectedly plot-heavy and the final shot is an idiotic literalization of an otherwise effective metaphor. Fortunately, the touch of light-hearted slapstick in the latter half helps with some respite.I'd be lying if I said that such constant sardonic detachment didn't become tiresome for all its impressive formal rigor. But that rigor is precisely what's ingenious about the screenplay. It manages to beautifully peel the layers off its characters and offers revelations about their true natures. A truly bittersweet peep into the sphere of real-world families, especially those that're falling apart.A gem as far as I am concerned, it gets my nod. Worth a try for people with an appetite for meaningful, offbeat cinema, but it may not resonate with you if a predictable run-of-the-mill entertainer is what you're after.",4,"TRACES OF ABSURDITY, BUT FULL MARKS FOR HARROWING DRAMA",1090454400,"07 22, 2004",2004,1782,"['Structurally', 'creative', 'movies', 'dramatic', 'shifts', 'tone', 'are', 'so', 'difficult', 'find', 'CGI-crazed', 'times', 'suspect', 'Door', 'Floor', 'may', 'be', 'remembered', 'quirky', 'offbeat', 'film', 'odious', 'bells', 'whistles.But', 'may', 'bag', 'academy', 'awards', 'lead', 'characters', 'especially', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'glimmers', 'film', 'excellent', 'screen', 'presence.The', 'plot', 'can', 'be', 'briefly', 'summarized', 'dire', 'examination', 'dysfunctional', 'marriage', 'two', 'rich', 'people', 'Two', 'messed-up', 'rich', 'people.If', 'look', 'close', 'may', 'find', 'soft-spots', 'implausibility', 'theme', 'tendency', 'fall', 'cute', 'maudlin', 'puffery', 'such', 'cant-get-along', 'parents', 'mourning', 'accident', 'young', 'person', 'life', 'changed', 'forever', 'brief', 'exposure', 'adult', 'dysfunction', 'friction', 'affection', 'older', 'mentor', 'devout', 'youngling', 'etc', 'etc.The', 'narrative', 'share', 'dark', 'moments', 'may', 'make', 'cringe', 'last', 'act', 'becomes', 'unexpectedly', 'plot-heavy', 'final', 'shot', 'idiotic', 'literalization', 'otherwise', 'effective', 'metaphor', 'Fortunately', 'touch', 'light-hearted', 'slapstick', 'latter', 'half', 'respite.I', ""'d"", 'be', 'lying', 'said', 'such', 'constant', 'sardonic', 'detachment', 'did', ""n't"", 'become', 'tiresome', 'impressive', 'formal', 'rigor', 'rigor', 'precisely', 'what', 'ingenious', 'screenplay', 'beautifully', 'peel', 'layers', 'off', 'characters', 'revelations', 'true', 'natures', 'truly', 'bittersweet', 'peep', 'sphere', 'real-world', 'families', 'especially', ""'re"", 'falling', 'apart.A', 'gem', 'as', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', 'nod', 'try', 'people', 'appetite', 'meaningful', 'offbeat', 'cinema', 'may', 'not', 'resonate', 'predictable', 'run-of-the-mill', 'entertainer', 'what', ""'re""]",N/A

Ted Cole (Jeff Bridges), a monumentally self-absorbed children's book author, hires a teen age boy named Eddie (Jon Foster) as an assistant for a summer on Long Island. Quite a bit of the book is a coming-of-age story of Eddie's affair with Ted's wife Marion (the excellent Kim Basinger), who is racked with grief over the death of the couple's twin boys. The young daughter Ruth (Elle Fanning) was conceived to ""replace"" the boys, but Marion cannot emotionally attach to her daughter.Jeff Bridges, in a monumental performance, takes center stage in the film. Ted orchestrates the summer in order to try to assuage Marion's grief while indulging his appetites in an affair with Mrs Vaughn (Mimi Rogers), a lonely neighbor. Things don't go as planned, and while it while i could describe the turns of the plot at length, suffice it to say that this is a film for adults, about love, loss, parenthood, the male ego, and so much more.

621922,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JMU1,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 7]","Whether you like John Irving or not, you must admit the great acting from Jeff Bridges, four-time Oscar nominee who should have win one or two already. In `Door in the Floor' he shows another excellent acting only he can do, which realizes two kinds of personalities in one character Ted Cole, essentially hopelessly selfish womanizer and amiable father of a lovely daughter. Frankly I thought the film itself, for all its moments, was not so good as some reviewers say. But to see Jeff Bridges doing the real professional job is alway a welcome thing.Like any Irving novels, the story of `Door in the Floor' is eventful, often exaggeratedly so. It's basically about one family including successful writer Ted Cole (Bridges) his wife Marion (Kim Basinger), and their daughter Ruth (Elle Fanning, sister of Dakota) While the married couple is living separately for the reasons suggested in the opening, a young assistant Eddie who wants to be a writer is hired by Ted. It sounds like 'Wonder Boys,' but the course of their change is more colorful than the life of Michael Douglas.Yes, anyone who knows some rules about this type of drama can tell what will happen to the family, or at least can sense that something will happen to the family which has already started to fall part. But as it is John Irving, whose previous filmed adaptations include `The Cider House Rules' and `The World According to Garp,' what happens is sometimes extraordinary. Young Eddie not only falls in love with Marion; Ruth witnesses their making love. Ted sketches his mistress Mrs. Vaughn (Mimi Rogers) posing naked (and really naked on screen) who causes major havoc when their relations are over. And the results are certainly funny to see.[GREAT ACTING & UNEVEN TONE] But for all its excellent acting from Bridges and Basinger, the film's uneven tone is doing harm to the film itself. Ted tells Eddie that one of the secrets of being good writer is to manipulate the readers. Right, and surely Ted (and Bridges) knows the secret; Basinger knows it; newcomer Jon Foster as Eddie also shows the sign of knowing it, only director Tod Williams seems to forget it when he needs it most. In short, why does the film need a silly smock and squid ink when Bridges is already perfectly in character? Or why so many nudities when mere suggestion is more effective? And why unnecessary flashbacks when Jeff Bridges' superb monologues are much more convincing?But perhaps I am demanding too much. Perhaps this is because I am not a big fan of John Irving novels. People don't say `The World According to Garp' (my favorite) is the best John Irving adaptation, but still I prefer the Robin Williams film to which I can relate more comfortably. There are many emotions in `Door in the Floor' and thanks to the great works from the actors the film is often funny and touching, but these emotions are often  presented very awkwardly with full frontal nudity of Mrs. Vaughn or graphic bed scenes of Eddie and Marion. I do not hate them, but still believe that they only hide the film's crucial symbolism or more important part of it, which is called `Door in the Floor.'",4,(3.5 STARS) Excellent Acting of Bridges in Uneven Adaptaion of (Typically) John Irving Drama,1133827200,"12 6, 2005",2005,3136,"['John', 'Irving', 'not', 'must', 'admit', 'great', 'acting', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'four-time', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'win', 'one', 'two', 'already', 'Door', 'Floor', 'excellent', 'acting', 'only', 'can', 'do', 'two', 'kinds', 'personalities', 'one', 'character', 'Ted', 'Cole', 'essentially', 'hopelessly', 'selfish', 'womanizer', 'amiable', 'father', 'lovely', 'daughter', 'Frankly', 'thought', 'film', 'moments', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'reviewers', 'say', 'see', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'doing', 'real', 'professional', 'job', 'alway', 'welcome', 'thing.Like', 'Irving', 'novels', 'story', 'Door', 'Floor', 'eventful', 'often', 'exaggeratedly', 'so', 'basically', 'one', 'family', 'including', 'successful', 'writer', 'Ted', 'Cole', 'Bridges', 'wife', 'Marion', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'daughter', 'Ruth', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'sister', 'Dakota', 'married', 'couple', 'living', 'separately', 'reasons', 'suggested', 'opening', 'young', 'assistant', 'Eddie', 'who', 'be', 'writer', 'hired', 'Ted', ""'Wonder"", 'Boys', 'course', 'change', 'more', 'colorful', 'life', 'Michael', 'Douglas.Yes', 'anyone', 'who', 'rules', 'type', 'drama', 'can', 'tell', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'family', 'least', 'can', 'sense', 'something', 'will', 'happen', 'family', 'already', 'started', 'fall', 'part', 'John', 'Irving', 'previous', 'filmed', 'adaptations', 'include', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'World', 'According', 'Garp', 'what', 'sometimes', 'extraordinary', 'Young', 'Eddie', 'not', 'only', 'love', 'Marion', 'Ruth', 'making', 'love', 'Ted', 'mistress', 'Mrs.', 'Vaughn', 'Mimi', 'Rogers', 'posing', 'naked', 'really', 'naked', 'screen', 'who', 'major', 'havoc', 'when', 'relations', 'are', 'results', 'are', 'certainly', 'funny', 'see', '[', 'GREAT', 'ACTING', 'UNEVEN', 'TONE', ']', 'excellent', 'acting', 'Bridges', 'Basinger', 'film', 'uneven', 'tone', 'doing', 'harm', 'film', 'Ted', 'Eddie', 'one', 'secrets', 'being', 'good', 'writer', 'manipulate', 'readers', 'Right', 'surely', 'Ted', 'Bridges', 'secret', 'Basinger', 'Jon', 'Foster', 'Eddie', 'also', 'sign', 'knowing', 'only', 'director', 'Tod', 'Williams', 'forget', 'when', 'most', 'short', 'why', 'film', 'need', 'silly', 'smock', 'squid', 'ink', 'when', 'Bridges', 'already', 'perfectly', 'character', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'nudities', 'when', 'mere', 'suggestion', 'more', 'effective', 'why', 'unnecessary', 'flashbacks', 'when', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'superb', 'monologues', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'convincing', 'perhaps', 'am', 'demanding', 'too', 'much', 'Perhaps', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'John', 'Irving', 'novels', 'People', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'World', 'According', 'Garp', 'favorite', 'best', 'John', 'Irving', 'adaptation', 'still', 'prefer', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'film', 'can', 'relate', 'more', 'comfortably', 'are', 'many', 'emotions', 'Door', 'Floor', 'thanks', 'great', 'works', 'actors', 'film', 'often', 'funny', 'touching', 'emotions', 'are', 'often', 'presented', 'very', 'awkwardly', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'Mrs.', 'Vaughn', 'graphic', 'bed', 'scenes', 'Eddie', 'Marion', 'do', 'not', 'hate', 'still', 'believe', 'only', 'hide', 'film', 'crucial', 'symbolism', 'more', 'important', 'part', 'called', 'Door', 'Floor']",N/A

'The Cider House Rules' was clumsily executed while 'Simon Birch' can barely be called a worthwhile flim. Writer/director Tod ""Kip"" Williams has broken the Irving curse with a film based on not an entire novel, but the first third of Irving's 'A Widow for One Year,' based on the notion that this section's three central characters are all capable of maintaining an interesting film.Williams turned out to be absolutely right. In adapting only the first, self-sufficient third of the sprawling life portrait, Williams avoids having to remove crucial moments and contrain the ever-important cycle of life. Irving's own poeticism is intact, as well, since there is no need to drastically restructure or slice-and-dice dialogue.'The Door in the Floor' is a rumination on grief. Its main characters --Ted (Jeff Bridges) and Marion (Kim Basinger) Cole-- each represent the various reactions to death in the family. In this case, Marion is the half of the couple that is hit the hardest by the death of her beloved sons in an exhaustingly emotional car crash. One of the film's most brilliant shots is of Basinger's eyes, staring cold into a distance of unfathomable lengths, a distance not recognizable to those who gravitate around her empty shell of a body. Here we see she cannot manage to move on with her life, her soul drained by depression.Ted, on the other hand, seems to be alive and well, full of heart and creativity, still thriving as ""an entertainer of children"" who ""likes to draw."" But Bridges maintains that Ted is the half of the couple that attempts to move on yet knows that there will always be a piece of himself missing, whether he'd like to admit it or not. The third party in 'The Door in the Floor' is young Eddie O'Hare (Jon Foster), who is hired by Ted more or less as a pawn in his marriage's separation rather than an assistant. Eddie resembles one of the Coles' two sons and ends up in a steamy affair with Marion that is borderline incestuous.Initially, 'The Door in the Floor' is elevated by great performances. Jeff Bridges turns out perhaps his best performance, capturing every nuance in Ted, culminating in the telling of his sons' deaths as if reading allowed one of his own children's books. This monologue is so perfectly detailed with puncturing subtlety that his words grow to be heart-poundingly emotional, full of subtext and gravity. Kim Basinger also turns out nomination-worthy work as Marion, almost literally climbing into her character's psyche of stone through her sole vulnerability, both aspects of Marion that are conveyed with precision. Jon Foster and Mimi Rogers, as Ted's needy nude model and mistress, are both very capable and manage to leave an impression. The film's further emotional weight is complemented by an elegant score and caressed by well-composed camera work.",4,A discreetly captivating piece on grief,1104969600,"01 6, 2005",2005,2917,"['Adaptations', 'Irving', 'novels', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'problematic', 'least', 'own', 'experience', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'was', 'clumsily', 'executed', ""'Simon"", 'Birch', 'can', 'barely', 'be', 'called', 'worthwhile', 'flim', 'Writer/director', 'Tod', 'Kip', 'Williams', 'broken', 'Irving', 'curse', 'film', 'based', 'not', 'entire', 'novel', 'first', 'third', 'Irving', 'A', 'Widow', 'One', 'Year', 'based', 'notion', 'section', 'three', 'central', 'characters', 'are', 'capable', 'maintaining', 'interesting', 'film.Williams', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'absolutely', 'right', 'adapting', 'only', 'first', 'self-sufficient', 'third', 'sprawling', 'life', 'portrait', 'Williams', 'having', 'remove', 'crucial', 'moments', 'contrain', 'ever-important', 'cycle', 'life', 'Irving', 'own', 'poeticism', 'intact', 'as', 'well', 'need', 'drastically', 'restructure', 'slice-and-dice', 'dialogue', ""'The"", 'Door', 'Floor', 'rumination', 'grief', 'main', 'characters', 'Ted', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Marion', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'Cole', 'represent', 'various', 'reactions', 'death', 'family', 'case', 'Marion', 'half', 'couple', 'hit', 'hardest', 'death', 'beloved', 'sons', 'exhaustingly', 'emotional', 'car', 'crash', 'One', 'film', 'most', 'brilliant', 'shots', 'Basinger', 'eyes', 'staring', 'cold', 'distance', 'unfathomable', 'lengths', 'distance', 'not', 'recognizable', 'who', 'gravitate', 'empty', 'shell', 'body', 'Here', 'see', 'can', 'not', 'manage', 'move', 'life', 'soul', 'drained', 'depression.Ted', 'other', 'hand', 'be', 'alive', 'well', 'full', 'heart', 'creativity', 'still', 'thriving', 'entertainer', 'children', 'who', 'draw', 'Bridges', 'Ted', 'half', 'couple', 'move', 'yet', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'piece', 'missing', ""'d"", 'like', 'admit', 'not', 'third', 'party', ""'The"", 'Door', 'Floor', 'young', 'Eddie', ""O'Hare"", 'Jon', 'Foster', 'who', 'hired', 'Ted', 'more', 'pawn', 'marriage', 'separation', 'rather', 'assistant', 'Eddie', 'one', 'Coles', 'two', 'sons', 'up', 'steamy', 'affair', 'Marion', 'borderline', 'incestuous.Initially', 'Door', 'Floor', 'elevated', 'great', 'performances', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'out', 'perhaps', 'best', 'performance', 'capturing', 'nuance', 'Ted', 'culminating', 'telling', 'sons', 'deaths', 'reading', 'allowed', 'one', 'own', 'children', 'books', 'monologue', 'so', 'perfectly', 'detailed', 'puncturing', 'subtlety', 'words', 'grow', 'be', 'heart-poundingly', 'emotional', 'full', 'subtext', 'gravity', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'also', 'out', 'nomination-worthy', 'work', 'Marion', 'almost', 'literally', 'climbing', 'character', 'psyche', 'stone', 'sole', 'vulnerability', 'aspects', 'Marion', 'are', 'conveyed', 'precision', 'Jon', 'Foster', 'Mimi', 'Rogers', 'Ted', 'needy', 'nude', 'model', 'mistress', 'are', 'very', 'capable', 'manage', 'leave', 'impression', 'film', 'further', 'emotional', 'weight', 'complemented', 'elegant', 'score', 'caressed', 'well-composed', 'camera', 'work']",N/A
621926,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B00005JMU1,Westley,"[8, 10]","""The Door in the Floor"" stars Jeff Bridges and Kim Basinger and is an adaptation of ""A Widow for One Year"" by John Irving.  Bridges is a successful but philandering author of children's books, and Basinger is his wife, who has been numbed into inaction by the death of their teenaged sons years earlier in a car accident.  After the accident, the couple have another daughter (Dakota Fanning's younger sister, Elle), but neither of them is really up to the task of raising her.  The action takes place one summer when a young intern (Jon Foster) hired by Bridges enters their lives.This movie is Tod William's second directorial effort, following ""The Adventures of Sebastian Cole.""  His work is quite masterful, and he pulls some great performances from his talented cast.  Bridges is often under-appreciated, and his acting here was very much overlooked; he should have been nominated for an Oscar.  Basinger is also very good, in a world-weary way.  In addition, the movie looks absolutely gorgeous and takes full advantage of locations in the Hamptons.  It also has a timeless feel - I initially guessed that the film was supposed to be set in the 1960s.  Little clues along the way suggested a more modern time era, but it wasn't until Jeff Bridges listens to a rap song on a car radio that it's completely apparent that the film takes place in the present.I'm not particularly a John Irving fan; in fact, I started reading ""A Widow for One Year"" shortly after it was released and only made it 1/4 through the book.  Furthermore, many adaptations of Irving's novels have tended to be either fussy (""Hotel New Hampshire"") or twee (""Simon Birch"").  Fortunately, ""The Door in the Floor"" is superior to these films, perhaps because it only presents the first 1/3 of the novel and focuses on just one story instead of the multi-plot colossuses in which Irving specializes.  The plot ends up being a bit simple, but the movie is probably the better for it.  Overall, ""The Door in the Floor"" is a terrific small film that I thoroughly enjoyed.",4,"""Everything in fiction is a tool.""",1136073600,"01 1, 2006",2006,2041,"['Door', 'Floor', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'adaptation', 'A', 'Widow', 'One', 'Year', 'John', 'Irving', 'Bridges', 'successful', 'philandering', 'author', 'children', 'books', 'Basinger', 'wife', 'who', 'been', 'numbed', 'inaction', 'death', 'teenaged', 'sons', 'years', 'earlier', 'car', 'accident', 'accident', 'couple', 'have', 'daughter', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'younger', 'sister', 'Elle', 'really', 'up', 'task', 'raising', 'action', 'place', 'one', 'summer', 'when', 'young', 'intern', 'Jon', 'Foster', 'hired', 'Bridges', 'enters', 'lives.This', 'movie', 'Tod', 'William', 'second', 'directorial', 'effort', 'following', 'Adventures', 'Sebastian', 'Cole', 'work', 'quite', 'masterful', 'great', 'performances', 'talented', 'cast', 'Bridges', 'often', 'under-appreciated', 'acting', 'here', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'overlooked', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Basinger', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'world-weary', 'way', 'addition', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'full', 'advantage', 'locations', 'Hamptons', 'also', 'timeless', 'feel', 'initially', 'guessed', 'film', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'set', '1960s', 'Little', 'clues', 'way', 'suggested', 'more', 'modern', 'time', 'era', 'was', ""n't"", 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'rap', 'song', 'car', 'radio', 'completely', 'apparent', 'film', 'place', 'present.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'particularly', 'John', 'Irving', 'fan', 'fact', 'started', 'reading', 'Widow', 'One', 'Year', 'shortly', 'was', 'released', 'only', 'made', '1/4', 'book', 'Furthermore', 'many', 'adaptations', 'Irving', 'novels', 'have', 'tended', 'be', 'either', 'fussy', 'Hotel', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'twee', 'Simon', 'Birch', 'Fortunately', 'Door', 'Floor', 'superior', 'films', 'perhaps', 'only', 'first', '1/3', 'novel', 'just', 'one', 'story', 'instead', 'multi-plot', 'colossuses', 'Irving', 'plot', 'up', 'being', 'bit', 'simple', 'movie', 'probably', 'better', 'Overall', 'Door', 'Floor', 'terrific', 'small', 'film', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed']",N/A

Just as Kim Basinger's would go:"" Eddie, you are so serious for your age."" She said that because she's numb and overly tramatized by the death of her teenage sons. This is about letting go of what has been taken away or lost and close that door forever.Both Kim Basinger and Jeff Bridges sort of gave the tramatic event a silent treatment and it had build a wall between them. It's unavoidable that an ignorant youngster like Jon Foster would provoke those old feelings when he asked Basinger about the deceased boys. She instantly turned to stone just like the day they died in the accident. Even Jeff Bridges had been avoiding ""the door in the floor"" for years. They just haven't dealt with it and memories will always come back and haunt them.Jeff Bridges is great, and he deserves extra credit for doing several scenes fully naked. His character's state of mind is the opposite of Basinger. He uses casual sex as a form of pleasure to escape from his depressing life. He feels obligated to stay with his wife when they no longer have any passion towards each other. Although he had constantly avoided opening the door to the floor, he ultimately does so, because he had to accept what he can't changed.Kim Basinger finally landed a great part again since her stunning role in L.A. Confidential. I enjoyed her a great deal in this film, because she had gone from so sad to letting herself go and sexually connects herself with Jon Foster. It was so mesmerizing to see her breaking down into tears when she was making love with Foster. Without a single line to deliver, her face expressed all her pain and sadness. She thought it was a mistake to have a baby(Elle Fanning) again after the teenage boys died. It didn't help them save the marriage, and she had stayed too long, even when she had lost all her feelings. She ultimately abandoned everyone including her daughther, because she didn't want to be a bad mother. I trully hope she will get her best actress award with this performance. Her final scene in the movie when she touches the face of Bridges before driving away was also a memorable part of this film. The two lead had almost no dialogues together. This shows how distant they have became, and they were no longer happy together.",4,Kim Basinger knocks at the door to the Oscar again!,1097971200,"10 17, 2004",2004,2399,"['was', 'very', 'moved', 'movie', 'dispite', 'fact', 'had', 'not', 'tried', 'be', 'depressing', 'was', 'right', 'tone', 'sadness', 'overwhelming', 'Just', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'would', 'go', 'Eddie', 'are', 'so', 'serious', 'age', 'said', 'numb', 'overly', 'tramatized', 'death', 'teenage', 'sons', 'letting', 'go', 'what', 'been', 'taken', 'away', 'lost', 'close', 'door', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'sort', 'gave', 'tramatic', 'event', 'silent', 'treatment', 'had', 'build', 'wall', 'unavoidable', 'ignorant', 'youngster', 'Jon', 'Foster', 'would', 'provoke', 'old', 'feelings', 'when', 'asked', 'Basinger', 'deceased', 'boys', 'instantly', 'turned', 'stone', 'just', 'day', 'died', 'accident', 'Even', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'had', 'been', 'avoiding', 'door', 'floor', 'years', 'just', 'have', ""n't"", 'dealt', 'memories', 'will', 'always', 'come', 'back', 'haunt', 'them.Jeff', 'Bridges', 'great', 'extra', 'credit', 'doing', 'several', 'scenes', 'fully', 'naked', 'character', 'state', 'mind', 'opposite', 'Basinger', 'casual', 'sex', 'form', 'pleasure', 'escape', 'depressing', 'life', 'obligated', 'stay', 'wife', 'when', 'no', 'longer', 'have', 'passion', 'towards', 'other', 'had', 'constantly', 'avoided', 'opening', 'door', 'floor', 'ultimately', 'so', 'had', 'accept', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'changed.Kim', 'Basinger', 'finally', 'landed', 'great', 'part', 'again', 'stunning', 'role', 'L.A', 'Confidential', 'enjoyed', 'great', 'deal', 'film', 'had', 'gone', 'so', 'sad', 'letting', 'go', 'sexually', 'connects', 'Jon', 'Foster', 'was', 'so', 'mesmerizing', 'see', 'breaking', 'down', 'tears', 'when', 'was', 'making', 'love', 'Foster', 'single', 'line', 'deliver', 'face', 'expressed', 'pain', 'sadness', 'thought', 'was', 'mistake', 'have', 'baby', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'again', 'teenage', 'died', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'save', 'marriage', 'had', 'stayed', 'too', 'long', 'even', 'when', 'had', 'lost', 'feelings', 'ultimately', 'abandoned', 'everyone', 'including', 'daughther', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'bad', 'mother', 'trully', 'hope', 'will', 'get', 'best', 'actress', 'award', 'performance', 'final', 'scene', 'movie', 'when', 'face', 'Bridges', 'driving', 'away', 'was', 'also', 'memorable', 'part', 'film', 'two', 'lead', 'had', 'almost', 'dialogues', 'together', 'how', 'distant', 'have', 'became', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'happy', 'together']",N/A
