I would have liked it better if they included maybe a book or something besides the disks like the Batman Animated series box set does.It mentions 4.5 hours of extras leading me to believe they added more extras but that's not the case. The extras are the same as in the individual sets.Packaging comes in 2 booklets made of cheap cardboard with very tight sleeves to insert the disks. This can and will cause some scratches on the disk being it's tight. About half my discs do have visible scratches on them.

1175579,A2Z65D8FBYDY63,B001CC7POE,Donald J. Wurzelbacher,"[3, 3]","Anyone purchasing this set already knows that 'The Flintstones' is the first prime time animated television series. It is hailed as one of the best animated TV series ever created. Very few people who review this product will dispute that it's a fun show, but most people are giving the same criticism...the way it is packaged as a box set. If you buy the set in seasons, it seems to have no packaging problems. But as a series, the manufacturers often like to find 'creative' packaging to make it look more attractive. Unfortunately these ideas often mean that packaging is all wrong for discs. This is no exception. The cardboard sleeves are very tight and definitely cause scratches every time you take a disc out. This is even more of a problem since some of the discs are double sided which I absolutely HATE. They get scratched and finger printed incredibly easily. So I actually took a scissors to the cardboard sleeves and cut each one down so that it slides much easier since now I can even put my finger in the hole of the disc to gently pull it out. Although it helps, I do believe it's best to do what most people suggest and what I have often done myself to other series shows. Purchase some empty DVD cases and put the discs in them. However, for me, it's not just that. I like to know what discs are in which sleeve and the titles of the episodes. So I put more effort into it and more expense by creating an insert using a computer and printer for each one. I also print a cover picture for the front and type episode titles on the back. I usually use double sleeves to save more space. It also bothers me in this set that the boxes in the packaging aren't the same size as my other DVD sets. I also create my own 'box' to store my sleeves in so that they stay together. it's work but in the end I have my boxed set which is easy to open and does not scratch as easily.",3,series great but packaging not so great,1395792000,"03 26, 2014",2014,1885,"['Anyone', 'purchasing', 'set', 'already', 'Flintstones', 'first', 'prime', 'time', 'animated', 'television', 'series', 'hailed', 'one', 'best', 'animated', 'TV', 'series', 'ever', 'created', 'Very', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'review', 'product', 'will', 'dispute', 'fun', 'show', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'giving', 'same', 'criticism', 'way', 'packaged', 'box', 'set', 'buy', 'set', 'seasons', 'have', 'packaging', 'problems', 'series', 'manufacturers', 'often', 'find', ""'creative"", 'packaging', 'make', 'look', 'more', 'attractive', 'Unfortunately', 'ideas', 'often', 'mean', 'packaging', 'wrong', 'discs', 'exception', 'cardboard', 'sleeves', 'are', 'very', 'tight', 'definitely', 'cause', 'scratches', 'time', 'take', 'disc', 'out', 'even', 'more', 'problem', 'discs', 'are', 'double', 'sided', 'absolutely', 'HATE', 'get', 'scratched', 'finger', 'printed', 'incredibly', 'easily', 'actually', 'took', 'scissors', 'cardboard', 'sleeves', 'cut', 'one', 'down', 'so', 'much', 'easier', 'now', 'can', 'even', 'put', 'finger', 'hole', 'disc', 'gently', 'pull', 'out', 'do', 'believe', 'best', 'do', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'suggest', 'what', 'have', 'often', 'done', 'other', 'series', 'shows', 'Purchase', 'empty', 'DVD', 'cases', 'put', 'discs', 'However', 'not', 'just', 'like', 'know', 'what', 'discs', 'are', 'sleeve', 'titles', 'episodes', 'So', 'put', 'more', 'effort', 'more', 'expense', 'creating', 'insert', 'using', 'computer', 'printer', 'one', 'also', 'print', 'cover', 'picture', 'front', 'type', 'episode', 'titles', 'back', 'usually', 'use', 'double', 'sleeves', 'save', 'more', 'space', 'also', 'set', 'boxes', 'packaging', 'are', ""n't"", 'same', 'size', 'other', 'DVD', 'sets', 'also', 'create', 'own', ""'box"", 'store', 'sleeves', 'so', 'stay', 'together', 'work', 'end', 'have', 'boxed', 'set', 'easy', 'open', 'not', 'scratch', 'easily']",The Flintstones: The Complete Series

As the years went by, it was interesting to watch the changes that happened:  a new opening theme song, the birth of Pebbles,  the appearance of Wilma's mother,  Anne Margrock (Ann Margret) and other unusual characters.I like watching the way the drawing style evolved over the seasons, as well as those things which never seemed to change.  With so much Flintstone's material available in this DVD set, it's easy to find occasional animation mistakes. My favorite is when Wilma's eyebrows disappear as she turns her head!

This makes it difficult to enjoy the shows.  I own a 26 inch Sharp TV, which is by no means any kind of high end TV. However, even with this TV I can see dirt, water spots, and scratches on every episode from the first season.  I haven't watched the rest so I'm not sure of the quality for the remaining seasons, but I suspect it will be the same.  You can clearly see dirt and water spots on the prints, especially on the faces of each character, due to the color used for their skin.  I loved this show when I was a kid, and am disappointed in the poor quality of the prints that were used to create the DVDS.

Originally airing in the early sixties on ABC from 1960-1966, ""The Flintstones"" has a place in American pop culture forever and thanks to timeless reruns and the advent of DVD these exceptional shows will live on in posterity. This beautiful set contains all 166 shows of the series run, restored with exceptional audio and video clarity. You will find the original openings of the show's first two seasons in this set, an opening that was ultimately replaced on all subsequent syndicated airings with the more popular opening from season three and on. However, what you won't find are the rare cigarette commercials certain characters did from the original network airings in which tobacco companies sponsored the show. ""The Flintstones"" never left the top 30 of all network shows during its first three years and it went on to enjoy immense success in syndication and eventually the DVD market, spawning theatrical features as well. This set contains some neat bonuses, including the original pilot of the series called ""The Flagstones"", as well as interviews with those who worked behind the scenes on the making of this television treasure. Sit back and enjoy Fred, Wilma, Barney, Betty, Dino, Pebbles, and Bam-Bam forever in the comfort of your own home without the hassels of TV commercials.",5,"""Yabba Dabba Doo!!!""",1261958400,"12 28, 2009",2009,1500,"['have', 'owned', 'television', 'set', 'last', 'several', 'decades', 'have', 'heard', 'come', 'episodes', 'Flintstones', 'one', 'very', 'first', 'animated', 'cartoons', 'ever', 'broadcast', 'American', 'network', 'TV', 'Originally', 'airing', 'early', 'sixties', 'ABC', '1960-1966', 'Flintstones', 'place', 'American', 'pop', 'culture', 'forever', 'thanks', 'timeless', 'reruns', 'advent', 'DVD', 'exceptional', 'shows', 'will', 'live', 'posterity', 'beautiful', 'set', '166', 'shows', 'series', 'run', 'restored', 'exceptional', 'audio', 'video', 'clarity', 'will', 'find', 'original', 'openings', 'show', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'set', 'opening', 'was', 'ultimately', 'replaced', 'subsequent', 'syndicated', 'airings', 'more', 'popular', 'opening', 'season', 'three', 'However', 'what', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'are', 'rare', 'cigarette', 'commercials', 'certain', 'characters', 'did', 'original', 'network', 'airings', 'tobacco', 'companies', 'sponsored', 'show', 'Flintstones', 'never', 'left', 'top', '30', 'network', 'shows', 'first', 'three', 'years', 'went', 'enjoy', 'immense', 'success', 'syndication', 'eventually', 'DVD', 'market', 'spawning', 'theatrical', 'features', 'well', 'set', 'neat', 'bonuses', 'including', 'original', 'pilot', 'series', 'called', 'Flagstones', 'as', 'well', 'interviews', 'who', 'worked', 'scenes', 'making', 'television', 'treasure', 'Sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'Fred', 'Wilma', 'Barney', 'Betty', 'Dino', 'Pebbles', 'Bam-Bam', 'forever', 'comfort', 'own', 'home', 'hassels', 'TV', 'commercials']",The Flintstones: The Complete Series

And now, thanks to modern stone-age technology, the entire series is available on DVD, featuring all 166 episodes from all 6 complete seasons. Growing up as a young kid in the late 60s/early 70s, I used to watch this show everyday after school as well as during the school breaks. It is interesting to note that in rerun syndication, an episode would feature Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm one day, but only Fred, Wilma, Barney and Betty the next day. Even the Christmas episode would be seen during the summer! Now, you can watch every episode of this timeless classic program in the original broadcast order, so you can easily see exactly how the series was able to develop over the course of 6 years. From the debut show 'The Flintstone Flyer' which opens season 1 to the final episode 'The Story Of Rocky's Raiders' which closes season 6, and all points in between, this DVD set is a must-have for every fan of Bedrock.
