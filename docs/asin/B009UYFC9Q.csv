1602430,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B009UYFC9Q,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I've been anxious to get my hands on `Wish You Were Here' for about a year now.  I heard about it last year when it was released in Australia and heavily anticipated a stateside release for an awards run in 2012, but that didn't happen.  Despite going on to win a slew of Australian awards (for everything from writing to acting) the film didn't catch on with American audiences when it was finally released in June of this year.  It never reached a theater near me, and so I patiently waited for the DVD release.  I found myself checking my Netflix `saved queue' every week, waiting for word on a release date and then finally it got bumped to the top of my queue and it landed at my front door the beginning of the week.I've been on the Joel Edgerton train for a while now.  I'll admit right here and now that he is the reason I was awaiting the film with such anticipation.  He's a staggeringly good actor, not to mention an incredibly handsome man, and he just drips with screen presence.  Watching his star slowly rise has been a dream, and with this film and his phenomenal turn in `The Great Gatsby', he's had a banner year so far.2014 looks even better.So, Edgerton is what drew me to `Wish You Were Here', and while he is brilliant in the film, he isn't the only thing that kept me watching.  In fact, this is an exceptional ensemble who works wonderfully within the confines of the film itself.  While the narrative is slightly fractured due to the constant flashbacks and oddly fit construction of the film, the performances drive so much of the intention home and make this an unforgettable ride that asks some very provocative questions without forcing us to come to a definite answer.  The open-ended morality of it all feels very intentional, and that makes for an even more impactful finish.The film tells the story of two couples who suffer a tragic loss while on vacation in South-East Asia.  Dave and Alice are happily married with two children and one on the way.  Alice's sister Steph is newly interested in a young business man named Jeremy who wants her to travel with him to Asia on business.  She convinces her sister and brother-in-law to tag along for moral support and the four wind up having a bang-up time.  The only problem is, only three of them return home to Australia.Jeremy is missing.As the plot unfolds the film weaves in flashbacks from their trip with their current debacle, which can get a tad confusing.  As secrets are told (there are more than one) and relationships are strained, the film asks some seriously poignant questions about guilt, betrayal and forgiveness, and it questions moral obligations with some sharply placed facial features.Like I said, the actors really sell this film.Edgerton is on a whole other level here, caging so much emotion and brooding to massive effect, only to unleash such unbridled grief at the film's climax.  Felicity Price, who also co-wrote the film, is devastating as his confused and heartbroken wife, and Teresa Palmer serves as a complicated cypher between the two.  The film's cinematography is astounding, some of the best I've seen all year, and the way that the film works itself over your eardrums (crawling into your body) makes this film stick in ways I didn't expect.",4,I wish more people saw this movie...,1381363200,"10 10, 2013",2013,3262,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'anxious', 'get', 'hands', 'Wish', 'Were', 'Here', ""'"", 'year', 'now', 'heard', 'last', 'year', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'Australia', 'heavily', 'anticipated', 'stateside', 'release', 'awards', 'run', '2012', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'going', 'win', 'slew', 'Australian', 'awards', 'everything', 'writing', 'acting', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'American', 'audiences', 'when', 'was', 'finally', 'released', 'June', 'year', 'never', 'reached', 'theater', 'so', 'patiently', 'waited', 'DVD', 'release', 'found', 'checking', 'Netflix', 'saved', 'queue', 'week', 'waiting', 'word', 'release', 'date', 'then', 'finally', 'got', 'bumped', 'top', 'queue', 'landed', 'front', 'door', 'beginning', 'week.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Joel', 'Edgerton', 'train', 'while', 'now', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'right', 'here', 'now', 'reason', 'was', 'awaiting', 'film', 'such', 'anticipation', 'staggeringly', 'good', 'actor', 'not', 'mention', 'incredibly', 'handsome', 'man', 'just', 'screen', 'presence', 'Watching', 'star', 'slowly', 'rise', 'been', 'dream', 'film', 'phenomenal', 'turn', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'had', 'banner', 'year', 'so', 'far.2014', 'looks', 'even', 'better.So', 'Edgerton', 'what', 'drew', 'Wish', 'Were', 'Here', 'brilliant', 'film', ""n't"", 'only', 'thing', 'kept', 'watching', 'fact', 'exceptional', 'ensemble', 'who', 'wonderfully', 'confines', 'film', 'narrative', 'slightly', 'fractured', 'due', 'constant', 'flashbacks', 'oddly', 'fit', 'construction', 'film', 'performances', 'drive', 'so', 'much', 'intention', 'home', 'make', 'unforgettable', 'ride', 'very', 'provocative', 'questions', 'forcing', 'come', 'definite', 'answer', 'open-ended', 'morality', 'feels', 'very', 'intentional', 'even', 'more', 'impactful', 'finish.The', 'film', 'story', 'two', 'couples', 'who', 'suffer', 'tragic', 'loss', 'vacation', 'South-East', 'Asia', 'Dave', 'Alice', 'are', 'happily', 'married', 'two', 'children', 'one', 'way', 'Alice', 'sister', 'Steph', 'newly', 'interested', 'young', 'business', 'man', 'named', 'Jeremy', 'who', 'travel', 'Asia', 'business', 'sister', 'brother-in-law', 'tag', 'moral', 'support', 'four', 'wind', 'up', 'having', 'bang-up', 'time', 'only', 'problem', 'only', 'three', 'return', 'home', 'Australia.Jeremy', 'missing.As', 'plot', 'film', 'weaves', 'flashbacks', 'trip', 'current', 'debacle', 'can', 'get', 'tad', 'confusing', 'secrets', 'are', 'told', 'are', 'more', 'one', 'relationships', 'are', 'strained', 'film', 'seriously', 'poignant', 'questions', 'guilt', 'betrayal', 'forgiveness', 'questions', 'moral', 'obligations', 'sharply', 'placed', 'facial', 'features.Like', 'said', 'actors', 'really', 'sell', 'film.Edgerton', 'whole', 'other', 'level', 'here', 'caging', 'so', 'much', 'emotion', 'brooding', 'massive', 'effect', 'only', 'unleash', 'such', 'unbridled', 'grief', 'film', 'climax', 'Felicity', 'Price', 'who', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'film', 'devastating', 'confused', 'heartbroken', 'wife', 'Teresa', 'Palmer', 'complicated', 'cypher', 'two', 'film', 'cinematography', 'astounding', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'way', 'film', 'eardrums', 'crawling', 'body', 'film', 'stick', 'ways', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect']",N/A

Theres not as much tension and suspense as I'd have thought, given the trailer and movie overview.  And it does get slow and bogged down in many spots.  But I still found it intriguing and wondered what happened to this dude.  as the movie progresses, it goes back and forth between the current time, and flashbacks to when the 4 were in Cambodia.  Some other reviewers seemed to think this back and forth was because the director was unimaginative.  But I saw it as a positive, if they had showed the whole time in cambodia, and then went to present day, i don't think the story would have worked as well.  this way, I think it lent more to the story, moving between their current actions, and what happened in Cambodia; how they interacted there and how that is compelling them to find out what happened.

They visit some of the remnants of the Killing Fields in Cambodia, shop for souvenirs and generally have a great time. Problem is, only three of them come back and the whereabouts of the fourth one becomes a highly charged mystery as this happy, sunny story takes a sinister turn and never goes back!We see:* Joel Edgerton (""Warrior"") is the concerned family man, with a boatyard to run, two little children, a third on the way, and a wife he adores. But he CAN be talked into a little vacation...* Felicity Price (Lots of TV) is the pregnant wife. It's her sister dating the importer who talks her and her husband into joining them on vacation.* Teresa Palmer (""Warm Bodies"") is the lovely younger sister who is a bit of a loose cannon.* Antony Starr (Lots of TV) is the handsome importer who initiates the trip. His whereabouts is the bone of contention with our trio, the drug enforcement people, and a few others I won't name.In my opinion, director Kieran Darcy-Smith (who also wrote the screen- play) uses an unnecessary number of flashbacks in this R-rated thriller.

1602435,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B009UYFC9Q,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","Note: Despite the enormous face of Theresa Palmer (a rising star after Warm Bodies) on the DVD cover, she plays a supporting role. The real female lead is Felicity Price and she's terrific. I guess she won't sell as many DVDs!The sparse Australian film ""Wish You Were Here"" is a small movie that might easily be oversold. If you look at the accolades that it received in its native land, you'd think you were witnessing a truly monumental experience. At the Film Critics Circle of Australia Awards, this picked up Best Actor (Joel Edgerton), Best Supporting Actor (Anthony Starr), Best Film and Best Screenplay along with a slew of other nominations including both leading ladies Felicity Price (who co-wrote the screenplay with her husband and the film's director Keiran Darcy-Smith) and Theresa Palmer. The Australian Film Institute chimed in with wins for Screenplay and Supporting Actor. I don't mention these awards to encourage you to watch the film because it's the ""best thing ever."" Quite the contrary. If you hear that this is ""the best thing ever,"" you might enter into the experience with lofty expectations that may not be fulfilled. It doesn't help that the picture is being marketed as some sort of thriller as this may further skew your notion of what the movie should be. In reality, ""Wish You Were Here"" is an intimate character drama that slowly unravels a mystery over the course of its running time. It features realistic performances, has an intriguing narrative structure, and works as a psychological study of people under duress. If you want a pulse pounding thrill ride, this isn't it (no matter how it is described).The movie begins in the aftermath of an ill-fated vacation to Cambodia. A married couple (Edgerton and Price) are returning to Sydney and their three children. Price's sister (Palmer) has stayed behind because her new boyfriend (Starr) went missing one evening after a fairly wild night of drunken revelry. With both the Cambodian officials and the Australian authorities on the case, everyone is trying to determine if something illicit happened or if he just wandered off temporarily. When no quick resolutions are at hand, Palmer is sent packing and reunites with her family. As the days go on, everyone is starting to feel increased stress. Price thinks they weren't forthcoming enough with the police, Edgerton seems to be falling apart, and Palmer also appears to be harboring a secret. The movie unfolds in a series of flashbacks and revelations, each one adding a further dimension to the story. Just what happened to Starr? The situation seems to weigh especially heavily on Edgerton and you know it's only a matter of time before the truth comes out.The strength of ""Wish You Were Here"" is definitely in its performances. I've never seen Edgerton so emotionally naked in a movie before and Price is a revelation. While the mystery is central to the plot, it is the disintegration of their marital bliss that is the film's heart and soul. Again, though, this is a film that requires a certain patience. It doesn't hit you over the head with overt melodrama, the movie slowly builds to its emotional catharsis through very naturalistic scenes of people living their lives. As the movie's non-linear structure slowly reveals more and more of what transpired, I was braced for the worst. In the end, though, I'm not sure the pay-off was particularly surprising. Trust me, my imagination was worse. But the conclusion seemed perfectly reasonable. This is a solid indie with a slow build tension and fantastic and believable performances. You just need to have reasonable expectations going in!

Alice's' younger sister, Steff, has just started dating an entrepreneur who is based in Cambodia and invites the couple for a week of hedonistic fun before their world is rocked by the wailing of the new baby. They go for the party scene full throttle; then after one particularly busy night, Steff's boyfriend goes missing. This is Jeremy and his phone is still on but there is no sight of him.Dave and Alice return to Australia and after more fruitless searches so does Steff. The events leading up to the holiday and indeed the happenings in Cambodia are played out in flashback. The narrative can jump around a fair bit so you need to pay attention (or is it me). This is happening as the present events are also unfurling and begin to have an effect on all those concerned. What will be revealed will have resonance for all.This is a `slow burner' and whilst the story line, at first glance, seems to lack a bit of originality - it actually will keep you guessing for quiet a while. Joel Edgerton (`Warrior' and `Gatsby') as `Dave' puts in an above solid performance but his long suffering wife, Alice, played by Felicity Price gives a performance that would stretch the best of them. It is also well directed and very well shot. The supporting actors are all very good too. It was also part sponsored by Screen Australia which is a credit to them. All in all a film that is recommended for fans of thrillers but who like a slow reveal.",4,Holiday Nightmare Tale from Australia,1405123200,"07 12, 2014",2014,1504,"['Married', 'couple', 'Dave', 'Alice', 'are', 'expecting', 'third', 'child', 'Alice', 'younger', 'sister', 'Steff', 'just', 'started', 'dating', 'entrepreneur', 'who', 'based', 'Cambodia', 'couple', 'week', 'hedonistic', 'fun', 'world', 'rocked', 'wailing', 'new', 'baby', 'go', 'party', 'scene', 'full', 'throttle', 'then', 'one', 'particularly', 'busy', 'night', 'Steff', 'boyfriend', 'missing', 'Jeremy', 'phone', 'still', 'sight', 'him.Dave', 'Alice', 'return', 'Australia', 'more', 'fruitless', 'searches', 'so', 'Steff', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'holiday', 'indeed', 'happenings', 'Cambodia', 'are', 'played', 'out', 'flashback', 'narrative', 'can', 'jump', 'around', 'fair', 'bit', 'need', 'pay', 'attention', 'happening', 'present', 'events', 'are', 'also', 'unfurling', 'begin', 'have', 'effect', 'concerned', 'What', 'will', 'be', 'revealed', 'will', 'have', 'resonance', 'all.This', 'slow', 'burner', 'whilst', 'story', 'line', 'first', 'glance', 'lack', 'bit', 'originality', 'actually', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'quiet', 'while', 'Joel', 'Edgerton', 'Warrior', 'Gatsby', 'Dave', 'above', 'solid', 'performance', 'long', 'suffering', 'wife', 'Alice', 'played', 'Felicity', 'Price', 'performance', 'would', 'stretch', 'best', 'also', 'well', 'directed', 'very', 'well', 'shot', 'supporting', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'too', 'was', 'also', 'part', 'sponsored', 'Screen', 'Australia', 'credit', 'film', 'recommended', 'fans', 'thrillers', 'who', 'slow', 'reveal']",N/A

Steph McKinney (Palmer) and her boyfriend Jeremy go on a vacation to Cambodia with her sister and her husband Dave (Edgerton). They are having a good time laying on the beach and relaxing. When they return home only three of them make the trip. Now all three are trying to figure out where Jeremy is and why he didn't come back. Only one person knows the truth. This is another perfect example of a movie where the idea is much more exciting then the actual movie. While the movie isn't that bad it is pretty slow moving up until the last 20 min. Until then the movie jumps around a bit and makes it a little hard to follow for the first half. The acting is very good but nothing really seemed to happen for most of the movie. Again, the last quarter is good but getting to that point is a little bit of a struggle. Overall, a movie that starts off very slow but worth sticking with to see the ending. I give it a B-.",3,"A movie where the plot & idea are better then the actual movie. Last 20 min are good, getting there is a struggle.
