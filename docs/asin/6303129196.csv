359460,A2M1N8G4W4END8,6303129196,Michael R Gates,"[12, 15]","True fans of Horror who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s love this show. Even Stephen King, in his book DANSE MACABRE (p. 216 of the oversized paperback), calls this &quot;the best horror series ever put on TV.&quot;  The show's host, Boris Karloff, was obviously no stranger to the genre, and  he even starred in several notable episodes.This particular episode,  &quot;The Grim Reaper,&quot; is a pretty good one.  The story centers a  wealthy writer of horror fiction and her visiting nephew. The nephew's plan  is to &quot;bump off&quot; his old aunt, using the legend of a cursed  painting of the Grim Reaper--a painting the aunt has recently purchased--as  his cover.  But, of course, there is more to the &quot;legend&quot; behind  the painting than the nephew realizes....As with all the good and great  episodes of THRILLER, this one does chill the bones.  Also notable are a  pre-STAR TREK performance by William Shatner, as the nephew, and a  pre-GILLIGAN'S ISLAND performance by Natalie Schafer as the wealthy aunt.  Definitely one of the THRILLER episodes that fans of the genre, especially  fans of classic horror, won't want to miss.",4,"Good Episode of a Sublime, Though Sadly Forgotten, TV Show",940464000,"10 21, 1999",1999,1146,"['True', 'fans', 'Horror', 'who', 'grew', 'up', '1960s', '1970s', 'love', 'show', 'Even', 'Stephen', 'King', 'book', 'DANSE', 'MACABRE', 'p.', '216', 'oversized', 'paperback', 'quot', 'best', 'horror', 'series', 'ever', 'put', 'TV.', 'quot', 'show', 'host', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'was', 'obviously', 'no', 'stranger', 'genre', 'even', 'starred', 'several', 'notable', 'episodes.This', 'particular', 'episode', 'quot', 'Grim', 'Reaper', 'quot', 'pretty', 'good', 'one', 'story', 'wealthy', 'writer', 'horror', 'fiction', 'visiting', 'nephew', 'nephew', 'plan', 'quot', 'quot', 'old', 'aunt', 'using', 'legend', 'cursed', 'painting', 'Grim', 'Reaper', 'painting', 'aunt', 'recently', 'purchased', 'cover', 'course', 'more', 'quot', 'quot', 'painting', 'nephew', 'realizes', 'good', 'great', 'episodes', 'THRILLER', 'one', 'chill', 'bones', 'Also', 'notable', 'are', 'pre-STAR', 'TREK', 'performance', 'William', 'Shatner', 'nephew', 'pre-GILLIGAN', 'ISLAND', 'performance', 'Natalie', 'Schafer', 'wealthy', 'aunt', 'Definitely', 'one', 'THRILLER', 'fans', 'genre', 'especially', 'fans', 'classic', 'horror', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss']",Thriller:Grim Reaper VHS
359461,A173B3M8WJ9WZI,6303129196,"Wilum Hopfrog Pugmire, Esq. ""H. P. Lovecraft ...","[0, 0]","This is my favourite episode of Boris Karloff's THRILLER.  The script was written by Robert Bloch, based on the short story of another writer.  In the original story, I believe, there is a painting of a woman who weeps real tears.  Bloch changed this into a weird tale concerning a diabolic painting that carries a curse, and brings death to they who own it.  A premonition of Death appears on the scythe held by the painted Reaper -- the blade of which is said to become stained with stigmata as a forewarning of impending doom.  The cast is brilliant, and the ending is one of the most frightening moments of pure terror even caught on film.  As with most episodes of THRILLER that were in the Gothic mode, this episode has extremely effective music and photography.  Bob's script is laced with his sardonic humor.  Happily, an official DVD box set of THRILLER is set for release in early 2010!!!",5,Outstanding Original Teleplay by Robert Bloch,1261872000,"12 27, 2009",2009,898,"['favourite', 'episode', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'THRILLER', 'script', 'was', 'written', 'Robert', 'Bloch', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'writer', 'original', 'story', 'believe', 'painting', 'woman', 'who', 'real', 'tears', 'Bloch', 'changed', 'weird', 'tale', 'concerning', 'diabolic', 'painting', 'curse', 'death', 'who', 'own', 'premonition', 'Death', 'scythe', 'held', 'painted', 'Reaper', 'blade', 'said', 'become', 'stained', 'stigmata', 'forewarning', 'impending', 'doom', 'cast', 'brilliant', 'ending', 'one', 'most', 'frightening', 'moments', 'pure', 'terror', 'even', 'caught', 'film', 'most', 'episodes', 'THRILLER', 'were', 'Gothic', 'mode', 'episode', 'extremely', 'effective', 'music', 'photography', 'Bob', 'script', 'laced', 'sardonic', 'humor', 'Happily', 'official', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'THRILLER', 'set', 'release', 'early', '2010']",Thriller:Grim Reaper VHS
