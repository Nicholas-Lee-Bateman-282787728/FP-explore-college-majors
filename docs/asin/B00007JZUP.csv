This movie is already being aired on network television, which gives you some idea of the kind of draw (and audience) the producers were expexting to attract. Seagal spends most of the movie clad in black (to hide his ever expanding bulk) and plays a government agent(yawn) who is double crossed and has to save the day, kill all the baddies, and exact revenge on his employers. Formula nonsense with plenty of gratuitous violence, bone crunching fight scenes, and acting performances straight out of the box (cardboard that is).

729785,A34A7QEBMYTALW,B00007JZUP,"Arthur Kicker ""Ragged, Tagged, and Bodybagged""","[8, 8]","'The Foreigner', along with 'Ticker', is just about the most hated Seagal flick by both the casual movie fan and the most devoted, dieheard Seagalogists.  So, I went back and pulled it from my Seagal DVD collection and gave it a repeat viewing.  I have come to decide that 'The Foreigner', while no where near the Lordly goodness of 'Belly Of The Beast' or 'Out For Justice', is much better than some of, in my opinion, Seagal's worst:  'Out Of Reach', 'Ticker', and 'Today You Die'.The plot goes a little something like this:  Lord Steven plays ex-CIA agent Johnathan Cold(by far the worst character name Seagal has ever had)who i guess is supposed to be in the same line of work as Jason Statham's character in 'The Transporter'.  So the Lord is hired to deliver a package to some rich business tycoon, but of course is turned on by the people who hired him, the rich business tycoon's wife tries to steal the package, and there's other bad dudes out to get the package as well.  Its all a little vague but if you don't concentrate too hard, you can ignore all the gaps in plot, and sorta kinda understand whats going on.Anyways, the Lord is pretty sick looking in this film:  he's tubby, his hair is nappy, and he has his arms crossed in front of his gut for approximately 80% of the film.  There are a couple decent fight scenes, but the majority of them is obviously done by a stuntman who looks nothing like nor weighs nowhere near as much as Seagal.  The only time the Lord appears during fight scenes is in close-up shots where it appears to be playing paddycake.  Oh, and about a third of Seagal's dialogue is dubbed by someone who sounds nothing like him.  But on the flipside, the cinematography is nice, the camera work is very well done, some very brutal shootings, and the acting is pretty good for the most part(especially by the black British guy who tortures Seagal near the beginning of the film; that guy is very good).Overall, 'The Foreigner' is not a good film but its definitely not the Lord's worst.  So I declare:  it is not as deserving of the venom that films like 'Ticker' and 'Out Of Reach' deserve.  Give it a second viewing and I don't think you'll hate it as much as you think you do.  You won't love it, but you might realize, like I did, that it does have a few good points.Oh, and as a little sidenote:  Seagal's next flick, entitled 'Black Dawn', is a sequel to 'The Foreigner'.  Go figure...he could have made a sequel to 'Under Seige' or 'Belly Of The Beast' or even brought back Gino Felino for 'Out For Justice 2' but he decides to bring back Johnathan Cold?

MYSTERY!) which is ?MYSTERIOUS? because the authorities are too wussy to open it for fear of what it may contain (Oooo!! INTRIGUE!). So who better to transport it from Poland to France but Steve?But of course the ?MYSTERIOUS? item is something dangerous that bad guys want to kill our hero to get. Is it a secret that must be covered up at all costs? A deadly weapon? A lost script of THE FOREIGNER with the movie's plot fleshed out to actually make some sense? No wonder this went straight to DVD.Naturally there's a high body count and the hilarious sight of Seagal at his most vacant and soft spoken.  THE FOREIGNER is a ""movie"" that is inarguably, (as I noted earlier) Seagal's worst since his sleep-inducing directorial ""effort"" ON DEADLY GROUND. But you'll find no actors of Michael Caine's caliber here. Sir Maurice Mickelwhite must've learned his lesson after his role in that lumbering pile of egotistical eco-twaddle.To put it bluntly, THE FOREIGNER is direct to DVD junk of interest only to those who love wallowing in senseless violence- but are willing to endure the incoherant plot and utter drabness which holds the bloodletting together. Even Steve's most hardcore fans may be unforgiving of this.  Avoid this one like the plague, unless you're angry at the Academy for snubbing ON DEADLY GROUND at the 1994 Oscars ceremony.

729792,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00007JZUP,Jeffrey Leach,"[12, 12]","If you, like me, ever wonder what happened to Steven Seagal, you need to run right out and pick up ""The Foreigner."" In the late 1980s and early 1990's, it looked as though Seagal would join the ranks of Hollywood's top action stars. You would hear his name in the same sentence with Arnie and Stallone, no small feat indeed. And to a large degree, Seagal's films deserved the comparison. ""Under Siege"" was a winner, as were ""Hard to Kill"" and ""Above the Law."" The actor's greatest appeal isn't hard to fathom; Seagal embraced a brutal form of martial arts that, at least onscreen, allowed him to slap down thugs, break bones, and wreak massive havoc without batting an eye. Literally, Seagal would stand in place and put down one goon after the other with an ease that looked not only natural but also realistic. I still enjoy watching that pool room scene where Seagal's character used pool cues, billiard balls, and whatever else he could lay his hands on to put out the trash. Alas, how the mighty have fallen. The early 1990s may as well be ancient history as far as Steven Seagal is concerned. Although he's still capable of making a few moderately entertaining films, far too often we're seeing movies like ""The Foreigner"" and ""Ticker.""Steven Seagal is Jonathan Cold, aka ""The Foreigner,"" which we learn toward the end of the film is a highly trained government operative who works overseas under deep cover. During the film we discover he's now working for some sleazy Polish goon who wants him to carry a package to a client somewhere in Europe as his final assignment. First, he has to pick up the package from a couple of Russians out in the countryside with his boss's other hired hand, the nefarious Dunois (Max Ryan). Predictably, the two engage in macho banter on the car ride out to the cottage, which allows us to learn that Dunois is a rather shady character, before the two narrowly survive a huge gun battle and fire at the house. Cold isn't happy about dealing with such dire circumstances, but he's a professional and won't give up on fulfilling his mission. Perhaps he should have since that would have saved the audience from enduring the rest of this amateurish piece of dreck. Anyway, Seagal heads off to do what he does best, unaware that his old boss from the CIA, Jared Olyphant (Gary Raymond), knows all about the box and wants what is in it. At least I think Olyphant is Cold's former employer; the movie's so convoluted that it's hard to keep track of the various characters.Before you can hit stop on your remote, all sorts of unpleasant people are gunning for our hero. Cold discovers that the package contains references to an air disaster in the 1980s, and also learns that wealthy industrialist Jerome Van Aken (Harry Van Gorkum) has something to do with the whole thing. While Cold scopes out the Van Aken estate, Dunois doggedly tracks him with the sort of persistence I wish I had as I tried to get through this movie. There's also a black assassin named Mims, hired by Jared Olyphant, gunning for the box. Cold eventually figures out, with a little help from Jerome's wife Meredith (Anne-Louise Plowman), that there's a huge conspiracy linking the information in the box with a corporate plot to create...well, I won't spoil it for you, but I ought to if it will prevent people from watching the film. Before we learn the shocking revelations that blow the evildoers' plans wide open, the movie treats us to several poorly edited action sequences that find Seagal's character infiltrating the Van Aken estate in order to blow away several beefy Slavic guards. He does it again later with Dunois, entering the compound by the SAME route he went in before. You would think the crack security team in charge of a billionaire's private residence would figure out a way to shore up the cracks, but you would be wrong.Absolutely nothing works in ""The Foreigner"" beyond a few exceptionally bloody squibs. Director Michael Oblowitz, who should now personify that age-old mantra ""you'll never work in this town again,"" simply doesn't know how to make a coherent movie. In the place of intriguing, deeply developed characters and original action scenes, he falls into the deadly trap of blaring techno music, cool dialogue that is neither cool nor makes sense, and continuity holes you could sail a battleship through. Even worse, the film relies way to heavily on speeding up or slowing down the speed of the film. I can understand using slow motion to show a body cartwheeling from a shotgun blast, but why do we need to watch Seagal's character sit down in a chair in slo-mo? It's one of those examples of a movie elevating style over substance. Problem is we've seen so many movies overuse these techniques that we recognize when it's poorly used. By far the most ridiculous aspect of the movie has to be how many times Dunois bites the bullet only to bounce back up for another round. I could go on and on.Did I hear you ask about extras? A bunch of trailers for other action films, including ""XXX,"" ""I Spy,"" ""Half Past Dead,"" ""The Foreigner,"" and ""The One."" They probably shouldn't have included some of these trailers on the disc, though. I kept thinking how much I would rather watch a few of these other films than this one, even the other Seagal low budget actioners. Actually, I also recently watched two other Steven Seagal films, ""Exit Wounds"" and ""Belly of the Beast,"" and both were much better than ""The Foreigner"" Perhaps this movie is an anomaly. I certainly hope so for Seagal's sake as even diehard fans will want to skip this clunker.",1,Oh the humanity!,1096848000,"10 4, 2004",2004,5584,"['ever', 'wonder', 'what', 'happened', 'Steven',

He then starts thinking, who is on his side and who is trying to kill him, so he can't deliver the package. He does open the package, and he finds out what it is. Im not going to tell you that.

Seagal plays someone who is supposed to deliver a package. Between pick up and delivery then viewer is left wondering what the hell is this all about. The actions scenes are marginal at best. The fight scenes were OK but the producers messed them up by using the super slow motion and then speed up technique coupled with some awful music. I bumped this film up a star because it is slightly better than Seagal's worst films. He has produced some films in which the sound quality and/or his mumbling of lines is so bad that you have no clue as to what is being said. The filming of the scenes in the Foreigner was decent. I suppose the film somewhat kept my attention as it was filmed in Warsaw, so I was constantly looking for familiar landmarks.

729797,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B00007JZUP,Martin Asiner,"[8, 8]","Once upon a time there was a Steven Seagal who was interesting to watch, even if he could not act. He frowned, he regularly broke the law that he was often sworn to uphold by stomping on the rights of street trash, and he used a brute force variation to Aikido that imbued him with bone-breaking power. That was the Seagal of his first films:ABOVE THE LAW, HARD TO KILL, and MARKED FOR DEATH. The audience did not particularly care that his acting abilities even then were non-existent. They responded to his take-no-prisoner attitude toward law enforcement. This Seagal liked to wear long leather coats, but he took them off often enough to show that he had a long and lean look that emphasized his rapid open handed punches into a slimeball's face. Beginning with UNDER SEIGE, ON DEADLY GROUND, and culminating with FIRE DOWN BELOW, a newer, paunchier Seagal emerged. This Seagal involved himself with social and environmental issues. He still managed to beat up hoods, but one could see that he was shifting gears from action hero to action hero with a conscience. Unfortunately, to have pulled this off would have required more acting skill than to ossify on command an already ossified countenance. But as I saw this second Seagal try to remake his image, I could still get some diminished pleasure in watching him do what he did best, even if it became increasingly clear that an ever expanding girth required camera trickery to simulate what the earlier Seagal used to effortlessly do. Now Seagal is truly no more than the fifty plus overweight talent challenged actor that perceptive critics labeled him as even back in 1988. In THE FOREIGNER, he is Jonathan Cold, a government agent of some sort, who is supposed to deliver a mystery package of some sort, to ill-defined criminal types of some sort. It is no exaggeration to say that this film makes no sense, whether one examimes it on the physical, metaphysical, or spiritual level. Seagal kills his partner no less than three times, with no explanation provided for these resurrections. At no time was I able to figure out even the glimmering of a logical plot. What I did see were frequent shootings, explosions, and body counts, all of which, I suppose, is sufficient for the film's executive producer to justify as the movie's basis for existence. Seagal, by the way, was the executive producer. For the true fans of Steven Seagal, the brute who entertained thrill-seeking audiences is no longer to be found.

729799,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B00007JZUP,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[1, 1]","For the uninformed viewer, you really need to look no further than ""The Foreigner"" when it comes to most of Steven Seagal's direct-to-video career: Seagal's stepping-stone into the lower rungs of cinema does a very good job at encompassing all of the faults that would be prevalent throughout classics likeSubmergedandAttack Force, effectively setting the poor standard to which the aikido master more or less held himself to. Even though it came off the heels of the semi-coherentHalf Past Dead, only the most enduring fan of Seagal will find this debacle accessible.In short, without the ridiculous sub-plots, the story is about Jonathan Cold (Seagal), a freelance agent hired to deliver a mysterious package from France to Germany. When he's targeted by assassins looking to intercept the parcel, he's forcibly thrown into a backstory political corruption, treachery, and murder.The plot is one of the film's initial falling points. Convoluted and unengaging to the point that few viewers will bother to catch the names of the main characters, it does a poor job of trying to appear smart and high-tech when all it is is the ill-conceived second attempt of writer Darren Campbell to craft a movie. On the other hand, the cast is probably the film's best asset. You'll be hard-pressed to figure out why anybody is doing what they're doing, but Max Ryan (Death Race), Anna-Louise Plowman (Stargate SG-1), Harry Van Gorkum (Dragonheart - A New Beginning), and Sherman Augustus (Virus) do their best to work around Seagal in his theatrical doldrum, and manage to create a fairly decent collection of characters.The rest of the movie, however, goes downhill. Seagal had packed on the weight and wrinkles so much since ""Half Past Dead"" that he looks like a completely different person. His action has suffered as well: he does more of his own fighting than you ought to expect in the future, but what's there is pretty uninspired. Add to that a couple of ho-hum shootouts and you've got yourself living proof that our hero is no longer what he used to be...and that's before you realize that about a quarter of his lines are being dubbed by another actor. Alas, the film's production itself is also in trouble. Dreary grey cinematography and the occasional silly line in the script (""You know, you kind of look like Ray Charles"") are only the tip of the iceberg, as senseless computer graphics and editing techniques try to spice up the otherwise mundane action and a handful of poorly-incorporated flashbacks only make the film more confusing. It's all just one big mess.Though the movie gradually gets more interesting in its last twenty-five minutes, nothing short of seeing Seagal return to form could have saved it, and that never happens. There are very few reasons to watch this film; only a diehard Seagal fan should have any interest in giving it a watch. Luckily, it's not a complete sum-up of Seagal's post-superstar career: if you're interested in some of his more decent DTV offerings, check outBelly of the Beast,Pistol Whipped, and a few others, but leave this one at the box office.",2,"""Naivity is not what I accuse you of ... however, arrogance does come to mind""",1224979200,"10 26, 2008",2008,3095,"['uninformed', 'viewer', 'really', 'need', 'look', 'further', 'Foreigner', 'when', 'most', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'direct-to-video', 'career', 'Seagal', 'stepping-stone', 'lower', 'rungs', 'cinema', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'encompassing', 'faults', 'would', 'be', 'prevalent', 'classics', 'likeSubmergedandAttack', 'Force', 'effectively', 'setting', 'poor', 'standard', 'aikido', 'master', 'more', 'less', 'held', 'Even', 'came', 'off', 'heels', 'semi-coherentHalf', 'Past', 'Dead', 'only', 'most', 'enduring', 'fan', 'Seagal', 'will', 'find', 'debacle', 'short', 'ridiculous', 'sub-plots', 'story', 'Jonathan', 'Cold', 'Seagal', 'freelance', 'agent', 'hired', 'deliver', 'mysterious', 'package', 'France', 'Germany', 'When', 'targeted', 'assassins', 'looking', 'intercept', 'parcel', 'forcibly', 'thrown', 'backstory', 'political', 'corruption', 'treachery', 'murder.The', 'plot', 'one', 'film', 'initial', 'falling', 'points', 'Convoluted', 'unengaging', 'point', 'few', 'viewers', 'will', 'bother', 'catch', 'names', 'main', 'characters', 'poor', 'job', 'trying', 'appear', 'smart', 'high-tech', 'when', 'ill-conceived', 'second', 'attempt', 'writer', 'Darren', 'Campbell', 'craft', 'movie', 'other', 'hand', 'cast', 'probably', 'film', 'best', 'asset', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hard-pressed', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'anybody', 'doing', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'Max', 'Ryan', 'Death', 'Race', 'Anna-Louise', 'Plowman', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'Harry', 'Van', 'Gorkum', 'Dragonheart', 'New', 'Beginning', 'Sherman', 'Augustus', 'Virus', 'do', 'best', 'work', 'around', 'Seagal', 'theatrical', 'doldrum', 'manage', 'create', 'fairly', 'decent', 'collection', 'characters.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'however', 'downhill', 'Seagal', 'had', 'packed', 'weight', 'wrinkles', 'so', 'much', 'Half', 'Past', 'Dead', 'completely', 'different', 'person', 'action', 'suffered', 'well', 'more', 'own', 'fighting', 'ought', 'expect', 'future', 'what', 'pretty', 'uninspired', 'Add', 'couple', 'ho-hum', 'shootouts', ""'ve"", 'got', 'living', 'proof', 'hero', 'longer', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'realize', 'quarter', 'lines', 'are', 'being', 'dubbed', 'actor', 'Alas', 'film', 'production', 'also', 'trouble', 'Dreary', 'grey', 'cinematography', 'occasional', 'silly', 'line', 'script', 'know', 'kind', 'look', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'are', 'only', 'tip', 'iceberg', 'senseless', 'computer', 'graphics', 'editing', 'techniques', 'try', 'spice', 'up', 'otherwise', 'mundane', 'action', 'handful', 'poorly-incorporated', 'flashbacks', 'only', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'confusing', 'just', 'one', 'big', 'movie', 'gradually', 'more', 'interesting', 'last', 'twenty-five', 'minutes', 'nothing', 'short', 'seeing', 'Seagal', 'return', 'form', 'could', 'have', 'saved', 'never', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'reasons', 'watch', 'film', 'only', 'diehard', 'Seagal', 'fan', 'should', 'have', 'interest', 'giving', 'watch', 'Luckily', 'not', 'complete', 'sum-up', 'Seagal', 'post-superstar', 'career', ""'re"", 'interested', 'more', 'decent', 'DTV', 'offerings', 'check', 'outBelly', 'Beast', 'Pistol', 'Whipped', 'few', 'others', 'leave', 'one', 'box', 'office']",N/A

Resurrected for box office dollars in 2001 with Exit Wounds, Seagal has managed to send it all crashing down again.This film was supposed to be a theatrical release, but that was contingent on how well Half Past Dead (the other half of a two-picture deal) did at the box office.  Yeah, it did that badly, and The Foreigner and Steven Seagal got thrown into the chasm of 'straight to DVD' flicks.  Seagal has been there before, his nadir being The Patriot a few years back.  It's unlikely that he'll be able to rise again, and perhaps it's just as well.This movie is not supposed to be good, per se.  Like so many direct to DVD genre flicks, The Foreigner takes familiar elements of good movies and weaves in a weak story to showcase the star, in this case, the expanding Steven Seagal.The decline of Seagal's career can be directly tied to his girth.  Tall and lean in Above the Law, he now resembles a porky Buddha with a lot of makeup and an receding hairline.  This film is filled with full-screen closeups of Seagal's heavily bronzed face.  He can no longer do fight scenes with any credibility.  Since the mid-90s directors have had to resort to jump cuts, fast motion, and other photographic trickery to make up Seagal's shortcomings.The story of the film is appropriately ridiculous.  The plot makes no sense, as Seagal plays Jon Cold, some kind of secret professional government agent for hire who has to deliver a package.  To who?  I don't remember, and neither will you.  It doesn't matter.The film is fun for a few reasons.  One, to see how shameless Seagal can be.  And two, there's a tongue-in-cheek tone to the procedings that make the slow-motion, cheesily stylized action sequences silly, violent, and mildly entertaining.  The director must hail from music videos and commercials as he uses pointless stylings like speeding up random shots of people walking, or ultra slow motion action to show a low budget stunt.  The movie resembles a music video by a band that has been reduced to self parody.It's better than Half Past Dead, a movie too easy to put down here.  If you love Seagal, then you know you'll inexplicably have to watch this film.

Having just finished watching the movie, I will say it is not the best Seagal, not close, but it was entertaining.  The body count was unduly high, even for Seagal.  This movie was at the lower end of his movies I've seen, so it rates about 3.  I was a little confused at the end as to who the French guy (or whatever nationality he was supposed to be) was working for, because the bad guys all appeared to be dead(not a big suprise).  The European locations where it was shot were excellent and the acting by some of the supporting cast was very humourous at times, such as the guy with the British accent trying to torture Seagal in his apartment.

Steven Segal is Jonathan Cold, a former deep cover agent now working freelance, who is hired to make a routine delivery of a package, and is determined to complete the job no matter how complicated it becomes.Director Michael Oblowitz's film, features some quirky hit men, who kill with little or no provocation.  Max Ryan is Dunois, an extremely irritating fellow, who is like a vile rash that just won't go away.  Mr. Mimms (Sherman Agustus) is a soft spoken professional killer, who is also quick to pull the trigger.  Identified only as Richard (Deobia Oparei) is a very self-confident heavy, who speaks in almost poetic verse.  His stay while amusing, is sadly short-lived.  Seagal does his usual thing, with his fighting skills accented and augmented by quick cut edits, and slow motion and fast motion techniques.  With so many engaged in murderous mayhem, Seagal has ample competition.The key figure in the maelstrom is Meredith Van Aken (Anna-Louise Plowman), who's strained relationship with her husband Jerome, prompts her to turn to Cold for help.  Those in Van Aken's employ are like lambs to be slaughtered, but finally when everyone is dead, and there are no more left to kill, the lady makes her exit with best wishes to one who's services are no longer required.  There apparently was a reason for it all, but the roundabout route, and copious violence tends to leave the senses numb.

Please.""The Foreigner"" is a direct-to-video film in USA, I now know, but that is no surprise.  The story is non-existent, concerning some mystery about a 'package' with which Steven Seagal's character, a sort of no-nonsense professional transporter, gets involved, but that's only an excuse for many body counts.  In fact, the film is just about pointless killings of mainly innocent people (two women included) or some mobsters who do not have even a chance to shoot at Seagal.  These guys somehow want to get this mysterious package, and under very occassional crossfires Seagal tries to reveal the truth about it and a beautiful wife of another mysterious owner of a big company.Seagal's character sees so many plot twists, and so many unconvincing situations too are inserted in the story that we start to lose interest after its opening 30 minutes.  One guy changes side; another guy also changes side, it seems ... before the first guys changes side again (sort of), and the blonde woman starts to mumble something that confuses Seagal.  And us too.  But without logical development of the story, the  film is just a mess.  Most unaccountably, Seagal the hero of the film doesn't know what he really wants to do, so why should we care?Everything is shot in Poland in a modern noir fashion, but that photography doesn't salvage the film from the dire misery.  Sorry to say this fans, but Seagal's career after surprise hit ""Exit Wounds"" has nosedived obviously, and I don't know what to say about him.  Warner Bros. was wise in telling him to join force with popular rapper DMX, who has shown more charisma to attact the audience.  At least those rappers (from LL Cool J to most successful Will Smith) know how to show themselves on screen.  And Seagal?  He needs either an acting coach or shape up.  None of them he seems to have had, judging from this messy film.Michael Oblovitz, who got a back-to-back contract to shoot Seagal films, is famous for creating moody atomosphere in his films (like vampire flick ""The Breed""), but as far as actions go, his way of showing them is little better than that of amateur.  Excuse me for this harsh review, but when Seagal throws a guy from an escalator, or shoots some thugs, the film uses very flashy techiniques -- jump-cuts, slow motions, you name it -- as if to suggest that this is a very cool action no one can imitate.  Come on, the trick is too obvious.I could find nothing recommendable about this film, which is a rare case for me.  But that is true, and no one even his avid fans should not deny that.
