1107400,A3PJQ4742VN84H,B000W8LX5G,"Hope this helps ""help""","[0, 0]","""Secret"" was one of the films I decided to try with some hesitation.  The plot line (as far as the description was concerned) almost turned me off to the film because of it's almost ""cliched"" description.  But the fact that it took place in a music school...and that it wasn't focused on ""bringing about a musical revival through more contemporary music forms"" (not that I have anything against those kinds of films...it was just a trope that was getting old for me as of late) was what swayed me to take a chance on this film.  I was pleasantly surprised and greatly moved by the film...and it caused me to look at life differently.  This is such a beautiful Taiwanese film.CONTENT ISSUES:Ultimately, you have nothing to worry about here.  There is absolutely nothing that parents should be worried about should they show this to kids.  There's no gratuitous sex or innuendos, no foul language...it seriously is one of the cleanest films that I've seen recently.  But keep in mind that this is a romance...not a kid's drama.PLOT (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS):Normally in my reviews, I do stress never giving out spoilers...but even more so I will emphasize that.  The reason is because, with this film, part of the beauty and message of it comes through the discovery and initial confusion.  I will at least tell you this much...any confusion you will experience is tied up rather nicely at the end.  Other things I really loved about the film was it's integration of music into ""everyday things"", and its exploration of the power of music and human emotion.  The pacing was fairly quick for an Asian film, but not out  of place.  It felt very full and complete.  The narrative itself is quite simple, but it's presentation is stunning and amazing.  What's more, though there's nothing ""new"" or ""groundbreaking"" about this film over others, it's presentation, how it was pieced together, and how smoothly it worked led me to many surprises in the film (I won't go into further detail lest I ruin the whole experience for you).  There are so many tearjerking moments, but also tons of cute moments that brought a smile.CHARACTERS:Generally speaking, the characters were good.  The male lead, however, could have been much stronger.  His role and the way he played it out wasn't terrible...but it just wasn't stunning.  That said, the story and how the female lead played her role more than made up for anything the male lead lacked...I mean, like seriously, her acting even made the male lead seem quite exceptional at points.CINEMATOGRAPHY:Very rarely do I feel a need to comment on camera angles and ""stage blocking"", but in this case I must.  I love how intentional all the shots and frames were.  Whoever planned out all of the blocking positions and the shooting path/angles was brilliant.  Not only did they capture some amazingly beautiful scenes and scenery that brought an almost fantasy'esque feel to the film, but they used the camera and staging to help further the intrigue of the story.  The camera work/stage blocking is just as much a part of storytelling as everything else.  What's more is that it's very naturally executed and does not feel forced at all.ALL IN ALL:This was a very beautiful film that gave me much to think about.  I'm more than glad I took a risk on it.  It caused me to cry like a baby at points as well as to smile like an idiot during other segments.  What's more, the way  they make music prominent in this film is amazing.  It was well crafted and pieced together...and encouraged me to enjoy my own life that much more.",4,You think it's going one way...then it pleasantly throws you unexpectedly to the ground.,1390003200,"01 18, 2014",2014,3557,"['Secret', 'was', 'one', 'films', 'decided', 'try', 'hesitation', 'plot', 'line', 'as', 'far', 'description', 'was', 'concerned', 'almost', 'turned', 'film', 'almost', 'cliched', 'description', 'fact', 'took', 'place', 'music', 'school', 'was', ""n't"", 'focused', 'bringing', 'musical', 'revival', 'more', 'contemporary', 'music', 'forms', 'not', 'have', 'anything', 'kinds', 'films', 'was', 'just', 'trope', 'was', 'getting', 'old', 'late', 'was', 'what', 'swayed', 'take', 'chance', 'film', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'greatly', 'moved', 'film', 'caused', 'look', 'life', 'differently', 'such', 'beautiful', 'Taiwanese', 'film.CONTENT', 'ISSUES', 'Ultimately', 'have', 'nothing', 'worry', 'here', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'parents', 'should', 'be', 'worried', 'should', 'show', 'kids', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'innuendos', 'foul', 'language', 'seriously', 'one', 'cleanest', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recently', 'keep', 'mind', 'romance', 'not', 'kid', 'drama.PLOT', 'ABSOLUTELY', 'NO', 'SPOILERS', 'Normally', 'reviews', 'do', 'stress', 'never', 'giving', 'out', 'spoilers', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'will', 'emphasize', 'reason', 'film', 'part', 'beauty', 'message', 'discovery', 'initial', 'confusion', 'will', 'least', 'tell', 'much', 'confusion', 'will', 'experience', 'tied', 'up', 'rather', 'nicely', 'end', 'Other', 'things', 'really', 'loved', 'film', 'was', 'integration', 'music', 'everyday', 'things', 'exploration', 'power', 'music', 'human', 'emotion', 'pacing', 'was', 'fairly', 'quick', 'Asian', 'film', 'not', 'place', 'felt', 'very', 'full', 'complete', 'narrative', 'quite', 'simple', 'presentation', 'stunning', 'amazing', 'What', 'more', 'nothing', 'new', 'groundbreaking', 'film', 'others', 'presentation', 'how', 'was', 'pieced', 'together', 'how', 'smoothly', 'worked', 'led', 'many', 'surprises', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'further', 'detail', 'lest', 'ruin', 'whole', 'experience', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'tearjerking', 'moments', 'also', 'tons', 'cute', 'moments', 'brought', 'smile.CHARACTERS', 'Generally', 'speaking', 'characters', 'were', 'good', 'male', 'lead', 'however', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'stronger', 'role', 'way', 'played', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'stunning', 'said', 'story', 'how', 'female', 'lead', 'played', 'role', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'anything', 'male', 'lead', 'lacked', 'mean', 'seriously', 'acting', 'even', 'made', 'male', 'lead', 'seem', 'quite', 'exceptional', 'points.CINEMATOGRAPHY', 'Very', 'rarely', 'do', 'feel', 'need', 'comment', 'camera', 'angles', 'stage', 'blocking', 'case', 'must', 'love', 'how', 'intentional', 'shots', 'frames', 'were', 'Whoever', 'planned', 'out', 'blocking', 'positions', 'shooting', 'path/angles', 'was', 'brilliant', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'capture', 'amazingly', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'scenery', 'brought', 'almost', ""fantasy'esque"", 'feel', 'film', 'used', 'camera', 'staging', 'help', 'further', 'intrigue', 'story', 'camera', 'work/stage', 'blocking', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'part', 'storytelling', 'everything', 'else', 'What', 'more', 'very', 'naturally', 'executed', 'not', 'feel', 'forced', 'all.ALL', 'IN', 'ALL', 'was', 'very', 'beautiful', 'film', 'gave', 'much', 'think', ""'m"", 'more', 'glad', 'took', 'risk', 'caused', 'cry', 'baby', 'points', 'as', 'well', 'smile', 'idiot', 'other', 'segments', 'What', 'more', 'way', 'make', 'music', 'prominent', 'film', 'amazing', 'was', 'well', 'crafted', 'pieced', 'together', 'encouraged', 'enjoy', 'own', 'life', 'much', 'more']",N/A

Now two people can fall in love without any serious drama, but if it's a movie, you don't need to spend an hour on that part of the story.

Fine music, good dialogue, very good acting, multi-lingual characters and a plot that would make Deleuze proud (somebody is listening!) There's also what I can only characterize as a strong Korean influence especially as regards cinematography but also in the consistent quality of the whole production. Anthony Wong is in the movie though without the fanfare that used to always accompany him.",4,maybe 5 stars,1392422400,"02 15, 2014",2014,509,"['dumbed', 'usa', 'movie', 'not', 'thanks', 'arts', 'least', 'world', 'phenomena', 'Fine', 'music', 'good', 'dialogue', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'multi-lingual', 'characters', 'plot', 'would', 'make', 'Deleuze', 'proud', 'somebody', 'listening', 'also', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'characterize', 'strong', 'Korean', 'influence', 'especially', 'regards', 'cinematography', 'also', 'consistent', 'quality', 'whole', 'production', 'Anthony', 'Wong', 'movie', 'fanfare', 'used', 'always', 'accompany']",N/A

I know Jay Chou has been a big star in the music scene of Asia, but I never thought he could make such an emotionally engrossing film. Those who were disappointed with his rather colorless performance in ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" will be amazed to see Jay Chou as gifted storyteller in ""Secret,"" his debut as director.Not much should be revealed about the story of ""Secret."" I only say it starts as a romance. Jay Chou plays a new student at art school, Ye Xiang Lun. In the old school building he encounters a beautiful girl student named Lu Xiao Yu (fantastic Lunmei Kwai) playing a mysterious tune on piano. Asked about the strangely absorbing song, she answers playfully, whispering to him that it is ""a secret,"" a secret that cannot be told.Yes, the romantic love story has a secret which no one should know. I'm sorry that I cannot disclose even the nature of it. All I can say is, when you think you know everything, you haven't even got a clue. Perhaps you should enjoy the love story of the two likable leads and you will see what I mean by and by.Anthony Wong plays the father of Jay Chou's character (as in ""Initial D"") and gives a comical touch to the film's slightly nostalgic world. There is a ""piano battle"" sequence that might remind us of ""The Legend of 1900"" (but done with less bravura), which is an enjoyable scene and also a showcase for Jay Chou's musical talent. Jay Chou's approach as director is surprisingly orthodox and he seems to always keep in mind that his goal is telling a good story. And he is very good at that.Beautifully shot ""Secret"" is a refreshing and well-told romantic story with originality. Strongly recommended for anyone who loves good romance.",5,(4.5 STARS) Jay Chou's Debut Film as Director Is an Engaging Romantic Drama (and a Secret),1221868800,"09 20, 2008",2008,1786,"['2007', 'Hong-Kong', '/', 'Taiwanese', 'film', 'Secret', 'one', 'recent', 'pleasant', 'surprises', 'know', 'Jay', 'Chou', 'been', 'big', 'star', 'music', 'scene', 'Asia', 'never', 'thought', 'could', 'make', 'such', 'emotionally', 'engrossing', 'film', 'who', 'were', 'disappointed', 'rather', 'colorless', 'performance', 'Curse', 'Golden', 'Flower', 'will', 'be', 'amazed', 'see', 'Jay', 'Chou', 'gifted', 'storyteller', 'Secret', 'debut', 'director.Not', 'much', 'should', 'be', 'revealed', 'story', 'Secret', 'only', 'say', 'romance', 'Jay', 'Chou', 'new', 'student', 'art', 'school', 'Ye', 'Xiang', 'Lun', 'old', 'school', 'building', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'student', 'named', 'Lu', 'Xiao', 'Yu', 'fantastic', 'Lunmei', 'Kwai', 'playing', 'mysterious', 'tune', 'piano', 'Asked', 'strangely', 'absorbing', 'song', 'playfully', 'whispering', 'secret', 'secret', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'told.Yes', 'romantic', 'love', 'story', 'secret', 'one', 'should', 'know', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'can', 'not', 'disclose', 'even', 'nature', 'can', 'say', 'when', 'think', 'know', 'everything', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'got', 'clue', 'Perhaps', 'should', 'enjoy', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'likable', 'leads', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'by.Anthony', 'Wong', 'father', 'Jay', 'Chou', 'character', 'Initial', 'D', 'comical', 'touch', 'film', 'slightly', 'nostalgic', 'world', 'piano', 'battle', 'sequence', 'might', 'remind', 'Legend', '1900', 'done', 'less', 'bravura', 'enjoyable', 'scene', 'also', 'showcase', 'Jay', 'Chou', 'musical', 'talent', 'Jay', 'Chou', 'approach', 'director', 'surprisingly', 'orthodox', 'always', 'keep', 'mind', 'goal', 'telling', 'good', 'story', 'very', 'good', 'that.Beautifully', 'shot', 'Secret', 'refreshing', 'well-told', 'romantic', 'story', 'originality', 'Strongly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'romance']",N/A
