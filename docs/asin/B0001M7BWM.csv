It's fun to see Donnie and Marie enjoy working together and have fun with each other. Our kids ask for it all the time.  The only thing is is that I wish they would've offered more shows .  The four shows you do get are great!  But more would be worth while for a 2 disc set.  I can't wait for Volume 2 to come out.  It would also be nice if they can include more Christmas shows also.  The Christmas show, (1978), they offer on dvd is also wonderful!  The whole Osmond family are in it!  Why can't they have good entertainment like this anymore.  Simple and with a whole lot of talent and showmanship!  I'm glad that they released these!

Denham,"[6, 7]","i was  excited to find out there were a couple of tapes for this show floating around.i was a huge fan as a kid back in the mid 70s, but i have to agree with the previous reviewer that this 'Best Of...' compilation is curiously disappointing.while its great to see faces like Paul Lynde, Bob Hope, Ted Knight, and the rest again, most of the skits are quite painful to endure.That is until Marie inevitabley cracks up.She and her brother had a tremendous chemistry together, and they almost always looked like they were having a lot of fun.for me, seeing them just relate to one another, especially in the opening segments, was worth the purchase.but i would really rather have a good multi-disc DVD set.wouldn't have to be a full season set, but something patterned after either Shout Factorys Here's Lucy set, or The Sonny & Cher Ultimate Collection.3 discs, with an assortment of clips spanning the different seasons- hopefully with more representation of the first season, which is not the case with the two VHS tapes.i wouldn't even go with complete episodes, since as has already been said, the scripted comedy bits (if the ones on these tapes are any indication) are now more cringe worthy than amusing.If i were producing it, i would dedicate one disc for  clips of a good selection of the opening numbers, ice skating, the opening dialouge bit, the closings along with non-skit guest star appearences.i would use disc two for a selection of complete musical numbers, and disc three could be reserved for solo skits and skits involving guest stars.at least, thats what i'd like to see.getting back to these tapes though,  the majority of clips on these tapes are NOT from 76/77 but rather from the tail end of the shows run (at which point the show had lost much of its popularity and Marie had a hairstyle that looked like she was 40 years old and running for a seat on the PTA board) .about a good 60% of all the material is from the shows last season, and only 10 minutes or so, if that much, are from the first (and most popular) season.i have to wonder if many tapes from that early 76 season actually even exist anymore?while a disappointment, it was still a kick to see again because afaik, this show has never ever been syndicated and i haven't seen this stuff in almost 30 years.a truly good collection for the shows remains to be produced though, and hopefully it will show up on DVD in the not too distant future.D&M;

One episode from each year, 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1979. The usual fare, it stars the singing brother and sister duo of the famed Osmond family, along with special guest stars appearing in some of the comedy skits. The first couple of shows features the regular cast of ice-skaters, the Ice Vanities, back when the show was produced in Hollywood by Sid and Marty Krofft Productions. The other two shows were produced in their home state of Utah. The Osmond family took over production after it was moved to their new home studios. The Ice Vanities ice-skaters were dropped from the cast.However, after looking at these shows, I'm a bit surprised that these shows actally clocked in at approximately 35 minutes for each episode.

I bought almost all of the shows in the past four years on video thanks to the internet. I hadn't seen the show (except in clips) since the 70's. I was very pleased when I heard it was coming out on DVD. BUT the four shows are EDITED. Up to 15 minutes on the 1979 show. What a disappointment. There are also no REAL special features. I believe all of this could have fit on one DVD! I don't believe Marie was involved at all in this project. I hope future volumes have more to offer. R2 Entertainment could have done better!!! I have their Tony Orlando & Dawn & The Captain & Tennille collections and they are better packages than this. This DVD was supposed to come out originally in April 2006 and after waiting all this time I expected a better collection. The sound is great as well as the DVD picture quality, but the editing and lack of special features prevents me from giving it 5 stars. The 1978 show is really from 1977, the 1977 show was actually aired in 1976. I don't like the false advertising. Don't manipulate the fans because we know better!!

This guy had, and has, it all.  An incredible singer with brilliant phrasing for motown, rock, ballads.  You name it, he can sing it.  And Marie, wow.  Very talented as well, and absolutely stunning!!  Always my definition of the perfect woman with her humor, looks and gracious disposition.And, unlike the other reviewers, I don't mind the editing of the shows, I just wish they would have edited them differently, focusing more on the musical segments, particularly those with Donny & Marie together and solo, as well as the Osmond Brothers...and completely eliminating the vacuous guest stars and little brother Jimmy (Am I the only one who has always seen Jimmy as the musical equivalent of nails on a chalkboard?)I just hope R2 releases all the shows on DVD sooner than later!!!!",5,Donny and Marie are a national treasure!,1163376000,"11 13, 2006",2006,1072,"['father', 'accomplished', 'musician', 'was', 'thrilled', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'amazingly', 'talented', 'duo', 'Donny', 'Marie', 'once', 'again', 'home', 'time', 'delight', 'own', 'son', 'well.I', 'continue', 'stand', 'awe', 'just', 'how', 'incredibly', 'talented', 'were', 'especially', 'Donny', 'guy', 'had', 'incredible', 'singer', 'brilliant', 'phrasing', 'motown', 'rock', 'ballads', 'name', 'can', 'sing', 'Marie', 'wow', 'Very', 'talented', 'well', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'Always', 'definition', 'perfect', 'woman', 'humor', 'gracious', 'disposition.And', 'other', 'reviewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'editing', 'shows', 'just', 'would', 'have', 'edited', 'differently', 'focusing', 'more', 'musical', 'segments', 'particularly', 'Donny', 'Marie', 'together', 'solo', 'as', 'well', 'Osmond', 'Brothers', 'completely', 'eliminating', 'vacuous', 'guest', 'stars', 'little', 'brother', 'Jimmy', 'Am', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'always', 'seen', 'Jimmy', 'musical', 'equivalent', 'nails', 'chalkboard', 'just', 'hope', 'R2', 'shows', 'DVD', 'sooner', 'later']",The Best of Donny and Marie: Volume 1
810479,AGW68YZZPOK6,B0001M7BWM,Xavier Limtuaco,"[31, 32]","Growing up as a kid in the 1970s, my siblings and I always looked forward to Sunday nights when we would gather in front of our TV set and watch our favorite foreign shows on Channel 7 one after the other. It started with The Muppet Show at 6pm, Donny and Marie, Mork and Mindy, Charlie's Angels and, finally, Three's Company.Having complete sets of Three's Company and Charlie's Angels, it was, therefore, such a joy to finally learn that Donny and Marie would finally be released on DVD. Inspite of the fact that this DVD set was advertised as ""Volume 1"" I still bought the DVD because, for me, owning this set was still better than none. Viewing the 4 select episodes with my mom last weekend (like we did 30 years ago) was a nostalgic event. We enjoyed seeing Donny and Marie all over again at their prime singing, acting and dancing their hearts out. I also still clearly recall their wonderful performance of ""Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing"" which was thankfully included in Episode 2 of this set so seeing this performance all over again was pure joy. After viewing the 4 episodes on 2 discs, (I got this DVD together with Season 6 of Golden Girls), I wanted more! I felt really disappointed that for 4 episodes, I had to pay $20.00+ which, when compared to the $27.99 cost of the Golden Girls Season 6 containing 21 episodes, was really a rip-off. It would have been such a great buy if this set was called ""Donny and Marie: The Complete First Season"" containing ALL episodes. When will we see that day? I am sure the manufacturers of this set had their reasons for releasing such an incomplete set but to fans like us, there is just no excuse for depriving us of the joy in seeing the complete first season and the next 3 seasons! I appeal to the people behind this set to please release the complete 4 seasons because I assure you of our complete support in purchasing the sets. The Donny and Marie Show deserves to be seen again and again by our generation and future generations as well because this show was simply brilliant and is a shining example of what great entertainment is all about. I would rate this 5-stars if it was the complete first season but due to incompleteness, I rate it only 3-stars.",3,A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT TO DONNY & MARIE FANS!,1164758400,"11 29, 2006",2006,2220,"['Growing', 'up', 'kid', '1970s', 'siblings', 'always', 'looked', 'forward', 'Sunday', 'nights', 'when', 'would', 'gather', 'front', 'TV', 'set', 'watch', 'favorite', 'foreign', 'shows', 'Channel', '7', 'one', 'other', 'started', 'Muppet', 'Show', '6pm', 'Donny', 'Marie', 'Mork', 'Mindy', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'finally', 'Three', 'Company.Having', 'complete', 'sets', 'Three', 'Company', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'was', 'therefore', 'joy', 'finally', 'learn', 'Donny', 'Marie', 'would', 'finally', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'Inspite', 'fact', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'advertised', 'Volume', '1', 'still', 'bought', 'DVD', 'owning', 'set', 'was', 'still', 'better', 'none', 'Viewing', '4', 'select', 'episodes', 'mom', 'last', 'weekend', 'did', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'nostalgic', 'event', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'Donny', 'Marie', 'over', 'again', 'prime', 'singing', 'acting', 'dancing', 'hearts', 'also', 'still', 'clearly', 'recall', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'Nothing', 'Real', 'Thing', 'was', 'thankfully', 'included', 'Episode', '2', 'set', 'so', 'seeing', 'performance', 'over', 'again', 'was', 'pure', 'joy', 'viewing', '4', 'episodes', '2', 'discs', 'got', 'DVD', 'together', 'Season', '6', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'wanted', 'more', 'felt', 'really', 'disappointed', '4', 'episodes', 'had', 'pay', '20.00+', 'when', 'compared', '27.99', 'cost', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'Season', '6', 'containing', '21', 'episodes', 'was', 'really', 'rip-off', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'buy', 'set', 'was', 'called', 'Donny', 'Marie', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'containing', 'ALL', 'episodes', 'When', 'will', 'see', 'day', 'am', 'sure', 'manufacturers', 'set', 'had', 'reasons', 'releasing', 'incomplete', 'set', 'fans', 'just', 'excuse', 'depriving', 'joy', 'seeing', 'complete', 'first', 'season', 'next', '3', 'seasons', 'appeal', 'people', 'set', 'please', 'release', 'complete', '4', 'seasons', 'assure', 'complete', 'support', 'purchasing', 'sets', 'Donny', 'Marie', 'Show', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'again', 'generation', 'future', 'generations', 'well', 'show', 'was', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'shining', 'example', 'what', 'great', 'entertainment', 'would', 'rate', '5-stars', 'was', 'complete', 'first', 'season', 'due', 'incompleteness', 'rate', 'only', '3-stars']",The Best of Donny and Marie: Volume 1
