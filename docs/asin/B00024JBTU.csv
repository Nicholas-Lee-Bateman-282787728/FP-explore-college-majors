824628,A1FATTRIXTSTEB,B00024JBTU,"Pamela Jarmon-Wade ""Tx Red Rose""","[0, 0]","This is a very enjoyable African American movie that speaks words of wisdom and also has some hilarious moments.  The main characters are Thomas (played by Darnell Williams aka Jessie on ""All My Children"") and Val (played by Salli Richardson).  Thomas is at a point in his life where he is living for the moment...taking it one day at a time.  Val is a high achiever borderline gold digger and she is not satisfied in the relationship.  She wants much more than Thomas can afford to provide.  After listening to her white female co-workers brag on vacations and dinners that their men lavish upon them, Val meets a white man and naivete takes over.  She thinks that all white men are the same.  I enjoyed the well depicted journey of Val discovering that the grass is not always greener on the other side.The supporting cast were great.  BJ drops words of wisdom throughout the movie.  He has figured people out to fit into one of three categories:  spiritual, intellectual, and base level.  Spoony keeps the laughs going with his mind always on women and sex.  Alex is the brother that dupes women into thinking he has it all together because of his car and clothes...but he is broke trying to maintain an image just to get women.  Charnele Brown has a small part in the movie.It takes Val leaving Thomas for him to get his life together.  It takes Val dating someone else in order to realize that Thomas is a good man that is just having a rough moment in life.  Will Val want him back after he gets it together?  Will Thomas want Val back after she did not stick with him during rough times? Low budget, but it is a good movie.",4,Much Wisdom,1207094400,"04 2, 2008",2008,1630,"['very', 'enjoyable', 'African', 'American', 'movie', 'words', 'wisdom', 'also', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'Thomas', 'played', 'Darnell', 'Williams', 'aka', 'Jessie', 'My', 'Children', 'Val', 'played', 'Salli', 'Richardson', 'Thomas', 'point', 'life', 'where', 'living', 'moment', 'taking', 'one', 'day', 'time', 'Val', 'high', 'achiever', 'borderline', 'gold', 'digger', 'not', 'satisfied', 'relationship', 'much', 'more', 'Thomas', 'can', 'afford', 'provide', 'listening', 'white', 'female', 'co-workers', 'brag', 'vacations', 'dinners', 'men', 'lavish', 'Val', 'white', 'man', 'naivete', 'over', 'white', 'men', 'are', 'same', 'enjoyed', 'well', 'depicted', 'journey', 'Val', 'discovering', 'grass', 'not', 'always', 'greener', 'other', 'side.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'were', 'great', 'BJ', 'words', 'wisdom', 'movie', 'figured', 'people', 'fit', 'one', 'three', 'categories', 'spiritual', 'intellectual', 'base', 'level', 'Spoony', 'laughs', 'going', 'mind', 'always', 'women', 'sex', 'Alex', 'brother', 'women', 'thinking', 'together', 'car', 'clothes', 'broke', 'trying', 'maintain', 'image', 'just', 'get', 'women', 'Charnele', 'Brown', 'small', 'part', 'movie.It', 'Val', 'leaving', 'Thomas', 'get', 'life', 'together', 'Val', 'dating', 'someone', 'else', 'order', 'realize', 'Thomas', 'good', 'man', 'just', 'having', 'rough', 'moment', 'life', 'Will', 'Val', 'want', 'back', 'together', 'Will', 'Thomas', 'want', 'Val', 'back', 'did', 'not', 'stick', 'rough', 'times', 'Low', 'budget', 'good', 'movie']",N/A
824629,A1NDYD4JKKY9LE,B00024JBTU,"Sarah Marie ""sarah_marie""","[0, 0]","The film is really good for  variety of reasons:1. A major point the movie is making is that it is the individual that is important (and can be good or bad). The race of the person is irrelevant.2. The movie deals with stereotypes of black men. This is shown by a black guessing what certain black men do and she ends up massively wrong over and over.3. The film deals with how men in general should treat women.4. The film deals with how some women can get unrealistic ideas of finding a rich man to solve all their problems.(Not many men are actually rich.)5. The film also deals with racism where a white man (Brandon) is willing to date Valerie (and he treats her well and with respect) but is reluctant to have her around when his other white friends are there. Also that Brandon doesn't truly understand Black culture and has no sympathy for the homeless or people like them.6. The fact that lives can be turned around if a person is willing to make an effort.7. There's a strong message about Black on Black violence.8. Men, both black and white, think being rich automatically can get a woman to have sex with them.9. Men in power may misuse that power to try to sexually control women",5,More than meets the eye,1377734400,"08 29, 2013",2013,1193,"['film', 'really', 'good', 'variety', 'reasons:1', 'major', 'point', 'movie', 'making', 'individual', 'important', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'bad', 'race', 'person', 'irrelevant.2', 'movie', 'deals', 'stereotypes', 'black', 'men', 'shown', 'black', 'guessing', 'what', 'certain', 'black', 'men', 'do', 'up', 'massively', 'wrong', 'film', 'deals', 'how', 'men', 'general', 'should', 'treat', 'women.4', 'film', 'deals', 'how', 'women', 'can', 'get', 'unrealistic', 'ideas', 'finding', 'rich', 'man', 'solve', 'problems', 'Not', 'many', 'men', 'are', 'actually', 'rich.', '5', 'film', 'also', 'racism', 'where', 'white', 'man', 'Brandon', 'willing', 'date', 'Valerie', 'well', 'respect', 'reluctant', 'have', 'around', 'when', 'other', 'white', 'friends', 'are', 'there', 'Also', 'Brandon', ""n't"", 'truly', 'understand', 'Black', 'culture', 'sympathy', 'homeless', 'people', 'them.6', 'fact', 'can', 'be', 'turned', 'person', 'willing', 'make', 'effort.7', 'strong', 'message', 'Black', 'Black', 'violence.8', 'Men', 'black', 'white', 'think', 'being', 'rich', 'automatically', 'can', 'get', 'woman', 'have', 'sex', 'them.9', 'Men', 'power', 'may', 'misuse', 'power', 'try', 'sexually', 'control', 'women']",N/A
824630,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,B00024JBTU,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[16, 16]","I admit my only reason for buying the DVD of How U Like Me Now as a birthday present for myself is because I'm a huge Salli Richardson fan. I was surprised to learn that Writer, Director and Producer Darryl Roberts has made a very inspired satire about lives and loves of African-Americans in Chicago. After watching this intelligent, hilarious and thought provoking DVD, it has become one of my favorite movies.How U like me now is the story of Thomas, a slacker who spends a lot of time hanging with his buddies, drinking beers and going to work when he wants to. His girlfriend Valerie wants him to do something with his life, but Thomas is too busy feeling sorry for himself to change things. Fed up with him, she starts to date a rich white man thinking he'll treat her better. When she finds out that the white guy treats her worse, she decides to go back to Thomas. However, when she goes knocking on his door, Thomas has taken time to better himself and is seeing a supportive sista he met at work. In this simple story Roberts adds many abstract layers and makes many comments about the black community and how blacks relate to each other. I recommend you watch the film twice to really understand it.How U Like Me now is one of those the rare African-American films that is not only a comedy, but also a social commentary about the state of the overall black community. The film is quite symbolic; each of the characters represents a section of the black community. The main character Thomas represents the black everyman frustrated with the direction of his life in white society and feels there's no way of changing it so he gives up. Valerie represents the educated black woman frustrated by the progress of her black man as compared to White men in American society. Spoony (He reminds me a lot of Quagmire on Family Guy) represents the hedonistic young black male concerned only with physical pleasure. Alex represents the Black conservative Uncle Toms, wanting to be white, perpetrating pretentiousness but in actuality is just like everyone else, struggling to survive. There are two dark skinned females who represent gold diggers and strong women, and a gay character representing black homosexuals. Roberts himself portrays a character that represents intelligent self-aware African Americans striving for self-empowerment and self-fulfillment. He spends most of the movie trying to pass knowledge onto his friends so they'll wake up, but no one listens to him. This rounds out the circle of friends in this Chicago neighborhood and shows us the diversity of viewpoints in the overall black community.Darnell Williams is great as Thomas. Williams expresses Thomas' frustration extremely well I could relate to his struggles because they're the same ones I face everyday. I'm an even bigger Salli Richardson fan after watching this movie. She gives one of her best performances as Valerie. She has great chemistry with Williams and does an amazing job of conveying Valerie's emotions. Watching her facial expressions during and after the film's only sex scene (I am so glad they actually had the characters discuss sex and relationships maturely instead of having people just roll in the hay in a gratuitous romp) made me realize how great an actress she is. She made that scene feel incredibly realistic! Those scenes and the scenes she has while staying at her mother's house are worth the price of the DVD alone; this is ACTING. Darryl Gardner is hilarious as Spoony, stealing every scene he's in. Raymond Whitfield does a great job playing Alex capturing the arrogance of the character. I wanted to slap him. Charnele Brown is great in her few scenes and Roberts himself is quite good as the self-aware brother no one listens to. The guy who plays the gay hairdresser does a great job; I'm so glad he didn't portray his character as a flamboyant cartoonish stereotype but instead played him as just an ordinary man who likes men. I'm sure I'm missing some people, but, everyone involved in this film should give themselves a round of applause. They've done a wonderful job of making these characters into real people who lived in the Chicago neighborhood.The production values on this film are great, considering the low budget. Filming the entire movie on location actually works to Roberts' advantage allowing him to create a movie that feels like real life transpiring onscreen. I felt the grittiness of early 90's Chicago in every frame. Shooting out of real shops and homes gives How U Like Me Now a heart and soul most other Hollywood produced black films don't have. Roberts writes a strong screenplay with only a few weak lines of dialogue and has a few story elements missing. In trying to tell the story the Roberts' direction is a little uneven and has some transition and cohesion problems, but the story and the message are easy to understand.My only beef is with Xenon on the crappy treatment they gave this great movie. Xenon printed this disc on the cheap making a bare bones one-sided wide screen DVD with no trailer or any extras. I would have loved to see some extra features and deleted scenes of this film. Better yet, I'd love to see a Director's cut of this movie with the deleted scenes added in. I know there were many important parts of this story cut out to make the 109-minute running time.I was in a bit of a writing slump until this movie. Seeing it has inspired me to get back to work behind the computer writing positive stories about the experiences of African-Americans.A Shawn James Five Star Essential Video BUY THIS NOW WHILE IT'S CHEAP. This movie is so good you'll wish you paid more for it!",5,Inspired piece of filmaking by Roberts with an excellent performance by Salli Richardson,1130112000,"10 24, 2005",2005,5653,"['admit',
