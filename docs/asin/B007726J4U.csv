Overall, it did a better job than most horror movies at giving you the creeps. There's no gore so it relies on things that go bump in the night to give you goosebumps. Die hard horror fans might want to skip this one, but fans of 'not so spooky spooky movies' might enjoy this.Cloris Leachman was great even though her screams started to get a bit annoying as the story wore on.

1527028,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B007726J4U,California Dreaming,"[2, 3]","""The Fields"" doesn't know if it wants to be a supernatural horror film or a crime thriller, and that is the biggest problem with this film.  Now, I have no problem with either genre.  As a matter of fact, I like them both, when done well.  However, I believe that this film succeeds at being neither.  But the question of the day might be:  why did the director and writer decide to go in this direction?Well, supposedly, this is based upon ""true events,"" whatever that means.  Some strange things were going down on the farm; were they ghosts or were they demons?  Or were they scarey carneys perhaps?  Well, the movie never seems to really say either way, and I'm not exactly sure that I even care after watching.  And most likely, no one really knew exactly what happened in real life, so the writer decided to take the easy way out and leave it open for interpretation for the viewer.Cloris Leachman is very good here.  I did get quite a few laughs out of her schtick.  And I found Joshua Ormond to be interesting; he reminded me of Danny Bonaduce from ""The Partridge Family,"" which is fitting since this film is set in the same era.  I think that some of the era was expressed here in the film, but some of the Charles Manson references were a bit overdone.It seemed like the film came from Mr. Ormond's perspective.  He looks up at the corn, and so do we.  As a matter of fact, everything to him is scary and foreboding, and we're supposed to be scared as well:  The corn.  The old, deserted carnival.  The scary relatives in the basement.  The clown on his dresser.  Surely, all of this was intentional by the director, not that I'm convinced that it actually worked.  I wasn't particularly scared by any of it.I wish that the film would have chosen what it wanted to be.  If it had, I'd maybe recommend it.

Unsure of who to trust, Steven keeps the information to himself, but whatever is lurking in the corn now has his scent! There is a heartfelt story buried somewhere within THE FIELDS, but it has yet to be discovered. The film feels like a hazy memory, and one that is filled with irrelevant facts and details that in no way serve to better the plot. At best, it represents the underlying fear and paranoia that spread following the Manson Murders, however, the remote location and un-compelling characters do nothing to draw us in. The documentary-style filming does lend an air of authenticity to the events, along with the set and costume designs. Although we want to root for Joshua Ormond as Steven, he simply isn't prepared to carry the male lead in a feature film. Between this and the general inactivity on-screen, it becomes difficult to recommend THE FIELDS to anyone outside of the True Crime enthusiasts.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",3,The Fields,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,1060,"['Young', 'Steven', 'sent', 'live', 'grandparents', 'farm', 'where', 'dead', 'body', 'hidden', 'corn', 'fields', 'Unsure', 'who', 'trust', 'Steven', 'information', 'lurking', 'corn', 'now', 'scent', 'heartfelt', 'story', 'buried', 'somewhere', 'THE', 'FIELDS', 'yet', 'be', 'discovered', 'film', 'feels', 'hazy', 'memory', 'one', 'filled', 'irrelevant', 'facts', 'details', 'way', 'serve', 'better', 'plot', 'best', 'underlying', 'fear', 'paranoia', 'spread', 'following', 'Manson', 'Murders', 'however', 'remote', 'location', 'un-compelling', 'characters', 'do', 'nothing', 'draw', 'documentary-style', 'filming', 'lend', 'air', 'authenticity', 'events', 'set', 'costume', 'designs', 'want', 'root', 'Joshua', 'Ormond', 'Steven', 'simply', ""n't"", 'prepared', 'carry', 'male', 'lead', 'feature', 'film', 'Between', 'general', 'inactivity', 'on-screen', 'difficult', 'recommend', 'THE', 'FIELDS', 'anyone', 'True', 'Crime', 'enthusiasts.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",The Fields
1527030,A1N37L78ZREG8Y,B007726J4U,Carolyn Paetow,"[4, 5]","It all depends on what scares you.  If you're frightened by folks who are rural, old, or speech impaired, this movie might give you nightmares.  If cows cause you to cower, you're in for a shiver.  If, however, corn fields make you flinch, these stalks will just seem corny.  The fact is, corn fields are naturally and truly scary.  You can't see what's in them.  The bladelike leaves rustle spookily in the wind and will cut you if you carelessly pass through them.  If the stalks are tall, you can get disoriented within their depths.  Stephen King knows all about it--as he does about clowns, for that matter.  The creators of this film, however, apparently do not--though feeble attempts are made to make both images terrorizing.Is this feature meant to be realistic, surrealistic, parodical, satirical, or absurdist?  Like an abstract painting, it's seemingly whatever you perceive it to be.  If you can believe that in Pennsylvania, in 1972, a commercial dairy farm could be situated in a filthy, squalid barn that co-housed hogs, then maybe you could see it as realistic.  Or, if it seems likely that, in that era, a bullied little country boy would go around with Shirley Temple locks or that a bigoted white oldster would entertain a kinswoman and her black beau...well, DO believe this:  in the seventies, common people did not over-spice their sentences with the F-word in the form of nouns, verbs, and adjectives!If you discern the movie as surreal or absurdist, no explanatiion is probably necessary--or even possible.  As parody or simple satire, though, the film can be more readily understood.  Since the vast majority of modern horror has heavy overtones of comedy, it should be no surprise that this offering is so sardonic in tone.  The rustic and the elderly, being symbols of traditionalism, can both be easily presented as iconic villains in contemporary features aimed at the very young, the urban, and the avant-garde.  Even the mentally and physically handicapped are permissably made funny if they are the results of rubish inbreeding.In actuality, great effort appears to have been put into the making of this movie.  The stark lighting, hollow sound quality, and sterile landscapes are undoubtedly attempts to convey a sense of unease, and, for those who find trepidation in rusty propane tanks and peeling paint, the result certainly constitutes eeriness.  For most lovers of horror film, however, this offering is bound to fail on all levels.  The movie has no discernable plot, no suspense, no revelation, and no conclusion.  It is simply a series of events in which the protagonist is frightened by odd people and unsavory places.  As a sort of psychological tableau, it succeeds.  As a horror movie, it does not.",2,Out of Left Field,1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,2745,"['what', ""'re"", 'frightened', 'folks', 'who', 'are', 'rural', 'old', 'speech', 'impaired', 'movie', 'might', 'give', 'nightmares', 'cows', 'cause', 'cower', ""'re"", 'shiver', 'however', 'corn', 'fields', 'make', 'flinch', 'stalks', 'will', 'just', 'seem', 'corny', 'fact', 'corn', 'fields', 'are', 'naturally', 'truly', 'scary', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'bladelike', 'rustle', 'spookily', 'wind', 'will', 'cut', 'carelessly', 'pass', 'stalks', 'are', 'tall', 'can', 'get', 'disoriented', 'depths', 'Stephen', 'King', 'clowns', 'matter', 'creators', 'film', 'however', 'apparently', 'do', 'not', 'feeble', 'attempts', 'are', 'made', 'make', 'images', 'terrorizing.Is', 'feature', 'meant', 'be', 'realistic', 'surrealistic', 'parodical', 'satirical', 'absurdist', 'abstract', 'painting', 'seemingly', 'perceive', 'be', 'can', 'believe', 'Pennsylvania', '1972', 'commercial', 'dairy', 'farm', 'could', 'be', 'situated', 'filthy', 'squalid', 'barn', 'co-housed', 'hogs', 'then', 'maybe', 'could', 'see', 'realistic', 'likely', 'era', 'bullied', 'little', 'country', 'boy', 'would', 'go', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'bigoted', 'white', 'oldster', 'would', 'entertain', 'kinswoman', 'black', 'beau', 'well', 'DO', 'believe', 'seventies', 'common', 'people', 'did', 'not', 'over-spice', 'sentences', 'F-word', 'form', 'nouns', 'verbs', 'discern', 'movie', 'surreal', 'absurdist', 'explanatiion', 'probably', 'necessary', 'even', 'possible', 'parody', 'simple', 'satire', 'though', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'readily', 'understood', 'vast', 'majority', 'modern', 'horror', 'heavy', 'overtones', 'comedy', 'should', 'be', 'surprise', 'offering', 'so', 'sardonic', 'tone', 'rustic', 'elderly', 'being', 'symbols', 'traditionalism', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'presented', 'iconic', 'villains', 'contemporary', 'features', 'aimed', 'very', 'young', 'urban', 'avant-garde', 'Even', 'mentally', 'physically', 'handicapped', 'are', 'permissably', 'made', 'funny', 'are', 'results', 'rubish', 'inbreeding.In', 'actuality', 'great', 'effort', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'making', 'movie', 'stark', 'lighting', 'hollow', 'sound', 'quality', 'sterile', 'landscapes', 'are', 'undoubtedly', 'attempts', 'convey', 'sense', 'unease', 'who', 'find', 'trepidation', 'rusty', 'propane', 'tanks', 'peeling', 'paint', 'result', 'certainly', 'eeriness', 'most', 'lovers', 'horror', 'film', 'however', 'offering', 'bound', 'fail', 'levels', 'movie', 'discernable', 'plot', 'suspense', 'revelation', 'conclusion', 'simply', 'series', 'events', 'protagonist', 'frightened', 'odd', 'people', 'unsavory', 'places', 'sort', 'psychological', 'tableau', 'horror', 'movie', 'not']",The Fields

WIth the backdrop of the 1960s, and the country mesmerized by the horrific acts of Manson and his followers, The Fields, shows the mentality of a nation losing its innocence.

1527035,A2N1EQWZ1Z4IMM,B007726J4U,"E. K. B. ""eblunt777""","[4, 7]","The Fields is a perfect thrill-filled horror flick. There's no gore, no screaming soundtrack, and no naked coeds flashing big new implants at you in 3D - so if you're under say 30, you may not appreciate the style. I, personally, feel this was the scariest film I have seen since the original Chainsaw Massacre ruined countless nights of sleep all those years ago.Corn fields - the fields they reference here - are some how creepy; always have been. Add to that filming when the corn is gone, and the six foot carcasses of stalk line up to create their own Halloween-worthy forest scape...one's imagination can roam into a frenzied Fearland at the mere thought of a crow taking flight.That being said, the story goes...It's 1973, and young Steven's (Joshua Ormond) parents are having a few problems. His overseers are too busy suspecting and accusing to allow focus to fall on the youngin'. So, off to grandma's house he goes.His father's parents' place. This quirky duo is a long-married tough sonovabitch sort. Gladys (Cloris Leachman) is eccentric and delightfully foul-mouthed, in that way many of us recall our own grand parents using the forbidden words as colorful adjectives. Hiney (Bev Appleton) is the sweet grandfather - he still has his post-deviling sparkle twinkling in those old eyes of his though.Their humble farm rests against a corn field; the kind that, while off-putting, beckons for perusal. Naturally little Steven is drawn in like any horror tale's main character...especially when he is told he better not go in there or he'll end up, as his loving grandma likes to point out, black and bloated and dead.Faster than you can say, ""Godzilla has attacked Toyk..."" the lad sneaks within.At this point of the film, you are petrified. All they've done is play some mood-altering music, showed a dysfunctional family's secrets, and reminded you about the Manson trial presently in their headlines.But, you are there with Steven. He's a curious, smart kid. Still he is a child. He sincerely ponders that this Manson chap could be out and about, taking their exit to get some fresh veggies and whatnots. Sure, Steven is in Pennsylvania, and Manson is behind bars in California - but Steven heard the phrase parole on the radio and that's enough to ignite his nightmares.Manson aside, something's up, and Steven is tuned in to it. And you're watching all this from his perspective.The Fields is brilliant. Screenwriter B. Harrison Smith wove a fine freckled fearfest here. Each of the characters is deeply built. Here, you won't find yourself yelling at the kuckudoo-for-brains characters for their stupid reactions; they are scared too - and they listen. You get the feeling the film makers crossed their T's and made sure people in this film were on the ball. From editing, location, clothes, set design - they didn't hand you an, ""Oh come on!"" moment once.You genuinely winced and begged Steve to get the hell outta there, and when he visits his ""odd"" aunt, you skeeve through the whole section of frames. That's the secret of The Fields' success; continued simple empathetic manipulations of the celluloid canvas before you.Joshua Ormond (Steven) is simply delightful. His face tells the story, and his ability to share fear is incredible; a lot was on this young actor's shoulders and he pulled off an Atlas-style showing. His parents Tara Reid and Faust Checho are spot on as young adults in a strained marriage. Johnson as Hiney is fabulous. And, let's be frank...I don't adore too many actor folks; one of my personal chickbabe idols, Cloris Leachman is one holding the Royal Flush at this high-stakes table of career-making hands. Leachman wields her ""Gladys"" like she's channeling some lower-middle-class grandma's skeleton-filled closet's soul. And, many of her lines make you bellow aloud towards the screen. Yet, her fear and care for the child are clear as a mosquito tableau in the finest Soviet amber (Watch her and I at The Pirate's of the Caribbean Red Carpet - she does a bit from High Anxiety).Get this. From The Fields' first atmospheric frame you can just tell this quiet film is gonna scare the bejeesus out of you. The people behind the film have grand futures.

1527036,AYG1U47VFZ165,B007726J4U,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[19, 36]","Having watched an awful lot of films in my time, every now and then I'm greeted with the real puzzle: how to explain my dissatisfaction with a motion picture I've found many viewers enjoyed.  At the end of the day, I've always chalked the difference-of-opinion up to matters of taste: put simply, ""while everyone may love ice cream, not everyone loves chocolate.""  By analogy, this helps underscore how I struggle with films: ""while everyone likes a good scare, not everyone appreciates the same terror.""  You can handle any genre the same way - what one person finds vulgar, another finds funny, and so on, and so forth.This brings me to THE FIELDS, a film whose advertising tells me is based on actual events.  In doing some online reading regarding how well the film has been received (I've mostly found middling to great reviews), I find myself at a loss.  Did I watch the same film?  Did I follow the same story?  Did it star the same actors?  Was this really based on true events?I fell down stairs once.  True story.  That doesn't mean that incident lends itself to a motion picture, especially one with bankable stars.  After watching a handful of the special features - particularly, I watched those that promised to expose the `true events' upon which the screenplay was based - I'm convinced that, while there very well may be a genuinely promising film that could evolve from such events, I don't think THE FIELDS is it.  In fact, at one hour and thirty-eight minutes, I felt THE FIELDS was probably one hour too long.  I've no doubt there's a story there - that kind of sinister spine-chiller audiences usually embrace - it just isn't one that deserves this level of commitment.I won't belabor the point any longer.  While the performances were interesting and the settings were exceptional, I thought THE FIELDS was horribly edited with many sequences simply hanging on way too long with no discernible reason.  Much of the script felt improvised - more than a handful of scenes play out in dream-like sequences, leaving me to question what was real versus what was only imagined.  Dialogue felt ad-libbed, and, while I wasn't particularly frightened, I wasn't particularly moved either.  Or interested.The film was produced by Mr. Big LLC and Expressway Productions, while Fabrication Films and Breaking Glass Pictures are also cited participants.  It all looks good, though I found the sound mix a bit muddled, at times; again, I'm not willing to say whether or not that was deliberate given the nature of the `tale' here because I don't know.  There are plenty of special features - history of the true events, behind-the-scenes featurettes, on-location specials, and the like - for anyone interested in exploring more about this unique film.  At the end of the experience, however, I can only chalk it all up to ""meh, this one just wasn't for me.""  In fairness, this happens to me a fair amount of the time with films similar in this haunted/spooky/what'sup genre, so please take that for what it's worth.At its zenith, THE FIELDS only manages one salvaging act - a saving grace for any film exploring what truly haunts us - and that's making healthy use of `atmosphere.'  There's a thick layer of dread over the entire film, no matter where it takes (or pushes) you ... from its aging farmhouses to a feces-stained milk factory ... from its decrepit and dilapidated theme park to its small-town general store ... but the ever-present and always-eerie cornfields surrounding everything takes the grand prize for ""Most Creepy.""  In fact, I'm giving it two stars overall on that point alone.  It really was ""most creepy"" in a lot of ways.NOT (REALLY) RECOMMENDED unless you're really still interested despite my review.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Breaking Glass Pictures provided me with a screener copy of THE FIELDS for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",2,THE FIELDS Is Mostly Lost In The `Corn',1333929600,"04 9, 2012",2012,3936,"['Having', 'watched', 'awful', 'lot', 'films', 'time', 'now', 'then', ""'m"", 'greeted', 'real', 'puzzle', 'how', 'explain', 'dissatisfaction', 'motion', 'picture', ""'ve"", 'found', 'many', 'viewers', 'enjoyed', 'end', 'day', ""'ve"", 'always', 'chalked', 'difference-of-opinion', 'matters', 'taste', 'put', 'simply', 'everyone', 'may', 'love', 'ice', 'cream', 'not', 'everyone', 'chocolate', 'analogy', 'underscore', 'how', 'struggle', 'films', 'everyone', 'good', 'scare', 'not', 'everyone', 'same', 'terror', 'can', 'handle', 'genre', 'same', 'way', 'what', 'one', 'person', 'vulgar', 'funny', 'so', 'so', 'forth.This', 'brings', 'THE', 'FIELDS', 'film', 'advertising', 'tells', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'doing', 'online', 'reading', 'regarding', 'how', 'well', 'film', 'been', 'received', ""'ve"", 'mostly', 'found', 'middling', 'great', 'reviews', 'find', 'loss', 'Did', 'watch', 'same', 'film', 'Did', 'follow', 'same', 'story', 'star', 'same', 'actors', 'Was', 'really', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'fell', 'down', 'stairs', 'once', 'True', 'story', ""n't"", 'mean', 'incident', 'motion', 'picture', 'especially', 'one', 'bankable', 'stars', 'watching', 'handful', 'special', 'features', 'particularly', 'watched', 'promised', 'expose', 'true', 'events', 'upon', 'screenplay', 'was', 'based', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'very', 'well', 'may', 'be', 'genuinely', 'promising', 'film', 'could', 'evolve', 'such', 'events', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'THE', 'FIELDS', 'fact', 'one', 'hour', 'thirty-eight', 'minutes', 'felt', 'THE', 'FIELDS', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'hour', 'too', 'long', ""'ve"", 'doubt', 'story', 'there', 'kind', 'sinister', 'spine-chiller', 'audiences', 'usually', 'embrace', 'just', ""n't"", 'one', 'level', 'commitment.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'belabor', 'point', 'longer', 'performances', 'were', 'interesting', 'settings', 'were', 'exceptional', 'thought', 'THE', 'FIELDS', 'was', 'horribly', 'edited', 'many', 'sequences', 'simply', 'hanging', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'discernible', 'reason', 'Much', 'script', 'felt', 'improvised', 'more', 'handful', 'scenes', 'play', 'out', 'dream-like', 'sequences', 'leaving', 'question', 'what', 'was', 'real', 'versus', 'what', 'was', 'only', 'imagined', 'Dialogue', 'felt', 'ad-libbed', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'frightened', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'moved', 'either', 'interested.The', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'LLC', 'Expressway', 'Productions', 'Fabrication', 'Films', 'Breaking', 'Glass', 'Pictures', 'are', 'also', 'cited', 'participants', 'good', 'found', 'sound', 'bit', 'muddled', 'times', 'again', ""'m"", 'not', 'willing', 'say', 'not', 'was', 'deliberate', 'given', 'nature', 'tale', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'are', 'plenty', 'special', 'features', 'history', 'true', 'events', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurettes', 'on-location', 'specials', 'like', 'anyone', 'interested', 'exploring', 'more', 'unique', 'film', 'end', 'experience', 'however', 'can', 'only', 'chalk', 'up', 'meh', 'one', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'fairness', 'fair', 'amount', 'time', 'films', 'similar', ""haunted/spooky/what'sup"", 'genre', 'please', 'take', 'what', 'zenith', 'THE', 'FIELDS', 'only', 'one', 'salvaging', 'act', 'saving', 'grace', 'film', 'exploring', 'what', 'truly', 'making', 'healthy', 'use', 'atmosphere', 'thick', 'layer', 'dread', 'entire', 'film', 'matter', 'where', 'pushes', 'aging', 'farmhouses', 'feces-stained', 'milk', 'factory', 'decrepit', 'dilapidated', 'theme', 'park', 'small-town', 'general', 'store', 'ever-present', 'always-eerie', 'cornfields', 'surrounding', 'everything', 'grand', 'prize', 'Most', 'Creepy', 'fact', ""'m"", 'giving', 'two', 'stars', 'overall', 'point', 'alone', 'really', 'was', 'most', 'creepy', 'lot', 'ways.NOT', 'REALLY', 'RECOMMENDED', ""'re"", 'really', 'still', 'interested', 'review.In', 'interests', 'fairness', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'disclose', 'fine', 'folks', 'Breaking', 'Glass', 'Pictures', 'provided', 'screener', 'copy', 'THE', 'FIELDS', 'expressed', 'purposes', 'completing', 'review']",The Fields

Everything from the locations and music to camera angles and lighting is superb for a modest-budget film (or genre film, really).  And the acting is top-notch.  Cloris Leachman is amazing and it's no exaggeration to say that in a different kind of movie, an Oscar nomination for supporting actress would not be out of the question.  The viewpoint of the film is largely that of 8-year-old Steven, played magnificently by Joshua Ormond.So why did ""The Fields"" leave me feeling so disappointed?It comes down to the story, which is a memoir of actual events in the life of scriptwriter Harrison Smith.  And it just doesn't add up to that much.  Don't get me wrong--I don't demand that every movie I see be ""The Avengers.""  I like smaller, quieter movies that focus on relationships and character.  But in a story that amounts to a modified version of the ""home invasion"" horror sub-genre, more must go on than an old couple and a kid being scared and running around.  I almost wished the movie didn't have any horror or thriller elements at all since as a slice-of-life drama, it rose above its material.Think of it this way: Suppose you got on a roller coaster, and the car chugs high up an incline to the top of the tracks--and then you go down at a leisurely pace with maybe a slight twist here and gentle turn there...but the view is amazing.  That's the case with ""The Fields.""  Everything about the scenery is well-done, but that is one tame ride.Having said that: MORE LEACHMAN!  Betty White gets all of the old lady parts.  No fair--the 86-year-old Leachman can not only match White's comedic talents, but she clearly has superior dramatic chops (White's cameo inLake Placidwas fun, but she played essentially the same person she always does--whereas Leachman is a revelation in ""Fields"").",3,"Fresh, skillful...and not very compelling.",1339545600,"06 13, 2012",2012,1850,"['list', 'great', 'things', 'movie', 'substantial', 'Everything', 'locations', 'music', 'camera', 'angles', 'lighting', 'superb', 'modest-budget', 'film', 'genre', 'film', 'really', 'acting', 'top-notch', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'amazing', 'exaggeration', 'say', 'different', 'kind', 'movie', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'supporting', 'actress', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'question', 'viewpoint', 'film', 'largely', '8-year-old', 'Steven', 'played', 'magnificently', 'Joshua', 'Ormond.So', 'why', 'did', 'Fields', 'leave', 'feeling', 'so', 'disappointed', 'down', 'story', 'memoir', 'actual', 'events', 'life', 'scriptwriter', 'Harrison', 'Smith', 'just', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'much', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'do', ""n't"", 'demand', 'movie', 'see', 'be', 'Avengers', 'like', 'smaller', 'quieter', 'movies', 'focus', 'relationships', 'character', 'story', 'modified', 'version', 'home', 'invasion', 'horror', 'sub-genre', 'more', 'must', 'go', 'old', 'couple', 'kid', 'being', 'scared', 'running', 'around', 'almost', 'wished', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'horror', 'thriller', 'elements', 'slice-of-life', 'drama', 'rose', 'material.Think', 'way', 'Suppose', 'got', 'roller', 'coaster', 'car', 'chugs', 'high', 'up', 'incline', 'top', 'tracks', 'then', 'go', 'down', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'maybe', 'slight', 'twist', 'here', 'gentle', 'turn', 'view', 'amazing', 'case', 'Fields', 'Everything', 'scenery', 'well-done', 'one', 'tame', 'ride.Having', 'said', 'MORE', 'LEACHMAN', 'Betty', 'White', 'old', 'lady', 'parts', 'fair', '86-year-old', 'Leachman', 'can', 'not', 'only', 'match', 'White', 'comedic', 'talents', 'clearly', 'superior', 'dramatic', 'chops', 'White', 'cameo', 'inLake', 'Placidwas', 'fun', 'played', 'essentially', 'same', 'person', 'always', 'whereas', 'Leachman', 'revelation', 'Fields']",The Fields

That translates to, ""This is some very large percentage fictionalized.""(3.) The overused, non-creative, cinematic hook of an overhead view of a car on a winding country road followed by a prolonged shot of a crow landing in front of the camera - acting like a crow.(4.) The predictable admonition, ""Don't go into the corn fields!""(5.) Heavy reliance on newspaper and tele scenes of Charles Manson (story set in the '70s) which has nothing to do with the movie.

They are so natural I'm left wondering how much was ad-libbed.  As for the film I was both intrigued & bored.  At times I'm thinking it's all an escape from reality but in the end it just seems like a coming of age story.  It's possible it just serves best as an exampe of how desensitized we have become to violence since the boy sees his father pointing a gun at his own mother, but later is excited to get a b b gun as a gift from that same father.  The real world is a scary place, as the deranged hippies (who I'm assuming were somehow tied to the Manson cult) aren't afraid to show.

Set in 1973 Pennsylvania, the movie is based on writer Harrison Smith's youth.  Joshua Ormond, a bright-eyed, mop-topped Booboo, is engaging in the role of a little boy facing the fears of childhood.  He has an alcoholic mother and an abusive father.  Godzilla is his guardian of choice, and he's terrified that serial killer Charles Manson will get paroled and come after him.  Leachman is stunning as Gladys, the foul-mouthed granny who loves horror-movies and emphatically warns Booboo to stay out of the nearby cornfields.  She also has a weird sister who has even weirder offspring.THE FIELDS sets you up for impending horrors, but it's really a coming of age story where real horrors lurk as close as your own bedroom.

But, this being a thriller, the elements of terror eventually had to be introduced. That's where it all fell apart for me. The plot becomes convoluted. Characters are thrown in for no apparent reason other than to misdirect the viewers attention. Things occur that seem to have absolutely no reason for happening.I watched the special features after the movie, hoping to get some clarification by learning the real story on which the movie is based. No help there. Listening to the actual real life character that this supposedly happened to, I got the impression that nothing really happened.

Leachman, an underrated treasure since per days as a performer on ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"",""Youn Frankenstein"" and a career that streches back to 1947(!) has experienced a late life career upswing (much deserved by the way)with her wacky comedic performance on ""Raising Hope"".You need to be warned however that ""The Fields"" really isn't a horror movie but a suspenseful coming-of-action Indie story that focuses on the relationship between a grandmother (Leachman) and her grandson Steven(Joshua Ormond). Set in 1973 in the wake of the Manson murders, ""The Fields"" is a good movie that often stretches for greatness but just misses the mark. That doesn't mean you shouldn't watch ""The Fields""--just adjust your expectations as some of the information out there presents it as a semi-horror movie. What Steven discovers in the fields surrounding his grandparent's farm house colors Steven's world outside of the fields and there is a menance that appears associated with it. Beyond that, I don't want to say too much because I might spoil it for those who like to discover good independent films on their own.""The Fields"" isn't a perfect film--the pacing is off particularly early on which, in a sense, is good because it doesn't tip the film director's hand but it also might make those who are casually watching the film not pay attention or turn it off as I did initially thinking it was another indie film that was underdelivering on its promise. The casting is also somewhat problematic--while Leachman and her co-star Bev Appleton as Steven's grandfather are terrific in their roles (and Joshua Ormond does quite well in his role as Steven)--Tara Reid who is top billed is truly awful here radiating an amateur quality that damages the film to a small degree.The ending of the film lacks the kick I had hoped for and plays a bit flat.The image quality for this DVD is pretty good. Colors look solid and blacks although not quite as solid as I'd like, look decent as well. The detail is quite good although that's a bit lacking in some shots as well.Audio sounds quite good with an immersive mix that particularly comes to life when Steven is surrounded by the cornstalks swaying in the breeze.We get a number of featurettes and while they aren't exactly earth shattering, they are quite good--The Making of the Fields, Real Stories & Faces Behind the Film, Hey, No Funny Stuff, Ladies & Gentlemen, Cloris Leachman! and finally a Photo Gallery. There are also a number of trailers for other releases Breaking Class Productions the studio that released ""The Fields"".More of an atmospheric film that echoes some of the stories of Ray Bradbury or Stephen King stories like ""The Body"" (which was the basis for ""Stand By Me""), ""The Fields"" is an entertaining if flawed film that doesn't quite sustain its suspense consistently and features some weak performances balanced out by a pair of terrific ones given by Leachman and Appleton.""The Fields"" isn't a great film and that's not a bad thing--there are so many good films out there that get over hyped or get lost in the discussion of what's so special about them that viewers come away disappointed--but a very enjoyable indie feature worth at least a rental.
