William Hurt played a role that I found unlikely but wonderfully interesting--a character who had many quirks, who was not a he-man but had exceptional courage.  Julia Ormond also played a different role.  I like this one.  I liked being surprised by it.  The subject matter was crucial, saving the talented during WWII to work and create again.  This movement was not something I was aware of, the intellectual elite saving the intellectual elite, bits of history of their several lives, with a great cast as well.

699615,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000065B03,Z Hayes,"[16, 17]","This little known gem of a Holocaust movie by Showtime is worth watching for its portrayal of an American intellectual, Varian Fry's efforts in rescuing Jewish artists & intellectuals trapped in Vichy France during World War Two. Although Varian's efforts were not publicly recognised until after his death in 1967, this movie showcases his heroism in a time when the US maintained a policy of neutrality in the war. Varian is played brilliantly by William Hurt and Julia Ormond shines in her role as the female assistant. The story moves along at a thrilling pace with Varian having to fend off the Nazis and the French securitate whilst undertaking efforts to transport Jewish refugees to Spain. Thanks to Varian Fry's little known heroism, the human race has been enriched by the works of such Jewish luminaries [amongst those he rescued] such as the artist Marc Chagall, and the author Hannah Arendt.
