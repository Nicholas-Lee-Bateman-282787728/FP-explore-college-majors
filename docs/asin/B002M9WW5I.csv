He is the kid everyone wanted as a friend in High School and College.  In Charlie Bartlett he is a principal who needs to learn more about his daughter.  Good movie, but Downey just doesnt fit the principal image.  I cant see him doing that job.  You keep waiting for him to tell someone off in his usual style.  And in the final movie the Shakespeare role while Downey is good, there isnt much of him on screen to compare.  Total surprise how he ends up.  But then I never read King Lear.  I never liked Shakespeare and this telling of it isnt much to go by.",4,Collection of some early Downey,1365379200,"04 8, 2013",2013,678,"['movies', 'show', 'very', 'yound', 'Downey', 'Back', 'School', 'Funny', 'geeky', 'altogether', 'not', 'Downey', 'now', 'still', 'good', 'kid', 'everyone', 'wanted', 'friend', 'High', 'School', 'College', 'Charlie', 'Bartlett', 'principal', 'who', 'learn', 'more', 'daughter', 'Good', 'movie', 'Downey', 'just', 'doesnt', 'fit', 'principal', 'image', 'cant', 'see', 'doing', 'job', 'keep', 'waiting', 'tell', 'someone', 'off', 'usual', 'style', 'final', 'movie', 'Shakespeare', 'role', 'Downey', 'good', 'isnt', 'much', 'screen', 'compare', 'Total', 'surprise', 'how', 'up', 'then', 'never', 'read', 'King', 'Lear', 'never', 'liked', 'Shakespeare', 'telling', 'much', 'go']","The Robert Downey, Jr. - Star Collection: (Charlie Bartlett / Back To School / Home For The Holidays / Richard III)"
