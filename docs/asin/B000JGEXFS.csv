1026371,A1PU9GCX6AB40D,B000JGEXFS,Lynnster,"[4, 7]","Very interesting & different. I was adopted as an infant & raised protestant in a congregational church in New England. My eyes were opened to the born-again lifestyle when I found my biological siblings & mother - all of whom are/were born-again. From my personal experience with my biological family & as seen with Marc, it seems that there is a common thread of severe life challenge/struggle for those who become born-again as adults. In my family's case, they didn't go off and join a cult or life of seclusion. They live & work in regular society & attend local born-again churches. In my view, raising children in a secluded population, as at the Farm seems a bit ""cult-ish"", but raising born-again children among the general population presents a different set of challenges for parents & for the kids as they can be shunned by their peers if not home-schooled. (born-again children are forbidden to read Harry Potter books, for instance) But I'm now off-topic..I think the most honest line in this documentary comes when Marc returns to NY for a very brief family visit, and his elderly aunt pronounces his new life as ""I think it's crap!""I was left wondering where Marc is now that it's 10 years later so I just googled his name & found a Marc Pimsleur MD living in Florida. I'd like to think it's the Marc of this film. If it is, I'm betting he's not only competent, but deeply compassionate, which is something very lacking in doctors of today.",4,where is marc now?,1271203200,"04 14, 2010",2010,1456,"['Very', 'interesting', 'different', 'was', 'adopted', 'infant', 'raised', 'protestant', 'congregational', 'church', 'New', 'England', 'eyes', 'were', 'opened', 'born-again', 'lifestyle', 'when', 'found', 'biological', 'siblings', 'mother', 'whom', 'are/were', 'born-again', 'personal', 'experience', 'biological', 'family', 'seen', 'Marc', 'common', 'thread', 'severe', 'life', 'challenge/struggle', 'who', 'become', 'born-again', 'adults', 'family', 'case', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'off', 'join', 'cult', 'life', 'seclusion', 'live', 'work', 'regular', 'society', 'attend', 'local', 'born-again', 'churches', 'view', 'raising', 'children', 'secluded', 'population', 'Farm', 'bit', 'cult-ish', 'raising', 'born-again', 'children', 'general', 'population', 'different', 'set', 'challenges', 'parents', 'kids', 'can', 'be', 'shunned', 'peers', 'not', 'home-schooled', 'born-again', 'children', 'are', 'forbidden', 'read', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'books', 'instance', ""'m"", 'now', 'off-topic..I', 'think', 'most', 'honest', 'line', 'documentary', 'when', 'Marc', 'NY', 'very', 'brief', 'family', 'visit', 'elderly', 'aunt', 'pronounces', 'new', 'life', 'think', 'crap', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'where', 'Marc', 'now', '10', 'years', 'later', 'so', 'just', 'googled', 'name', 'found', 'Marc', 'Pimsleur', 'MD', 'living', 'Florida', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', 'Marc', 'film', ""'m"", 'betting', 'not', 'only', 'competent', 'deeply', 'compassionate', 'something', 'very', 'lacking', 'doctors', 'today']",Brother Born Again

1026373,AQ2UN38CMK119,B000JGEXFS,P. Mann,"[3, 7]","Director Julia Pimsleur and her brother Marc were raised in a Jewish family. However, when Marc became a born-again Christian, a rift developed, in large part because he moved to an Alaskan farm where his faith was an integral part of life. (At one point, his sister compares the farm to a kibbutz.) Add to this the fact that Julia labels herself as bisexual, and the rift grows.The film is not so much an attempt to investigate faith (or any faith in particular) as it is the director's attempt to reconcile with her brother. In other words, the primary emphasis is familial, not theological. And yet despite the intimacy of the subject matter, the film is surprisingly calm. Both Julia and Marc treat each other with respect, though not necessarily for their views. That restraint is at times rather frustrating. The civility almost makes it seem as if the two are merely going through the motions. I would have liked to see more emotion.",4,A sister's journey to rediscover her brother,1231113600,"01 5, 2009",2009,940,"['Director', 'Julia', 'Pimsleur', 'brother', 'Marc', 'were', 'raised', 'Jewish', 'family', 'However', 'when', 'Marc', 'became', 'born-again', 'Christian', 'rift', 'developed', 'large', 'part', 'moved', 'Alaskan', 'farm', 'where', 'faith', 'was', 'integral', 'part', 'life', 'one', 'point', 'sister', 'farm', 'kibbutz', 'Add', 'fact', 'Julia', 'bisexual', 'rift', 'grows.The', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'attempt', 'investigate', 'faith', 'faith', 'particular', 'director', 'attempt', 'reconcile', 'brother', 'other', 'words', 'primary', 'emphasis', 'familial', 'not', 'theological', 'yet', 'intimacy', 'subject', 'matter', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'calm', 'Julia', 'Marc', 'treat', 'other', 'respect', 'not', 'necessarily', 'views', 'restraint', 'times', 'rather', 'frustrating', 'civility', 'almost', 'seem', 'two', 'are', 'merely', 'going', 'motions', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'emotion']",Brother Born Again

The film shows Julia, a young woman probably in her late 20's living a very New York lifestyle--atheistic, urban, bi-sexual and....a film maker ---taking a trip to a Christian farm in rural Alaska to make contact with her brother, Marc.  At first it seems there are some irreconcilable differences.  Julia demands that Marc accept her Lesbian lifestyle which he refuses to do.  Julia seems bent on convincing Marc that he is wrong and that he should, at least come back to civilization.  Gradually, though she comes to accept the fact that Marc is happy where he is and that he still loves her as a sister even though their beliefs differ.There are some lovely shots of the farm.  We see Julia romping in the grass with new born puppies and learning to fish and shoot with Marc.  Throughout the film she engages others as well as Marc in sincere questioning of their beliefs.  She is smart and fierce in her questioning and at the same time open and honest.  I applaud  both of them for the way they confronted one another's beliefs in a respectful way that even became affectionate and humorous.Later in the film Marc visits Julia and his mother and great aunt in New York.  By this time both Julia and her mother seem to have come around a lot in supporting Marc in doing what makes him happy.The film ended in a way that honored everyone's choices.  It was truly heartening to see how these people addressed their problems in an open minded way that seemed to bring them all closer together than they had been in a long time.",4,Well done film on a difficult topic,1370736000,"06 9, 2013",2013,1679,"['was', 'very', 'impressed', 'way', 'brother', 'sister', 'managed', 'maintain', 'loving', 'connection', 'spite', 'huge', 'ideological', 'differences', 'film', 'Julia', 'young', 'woman', 'probably', 'late', '20', 'living', 'very', 'New', 'York', 'lifestyle', 'atheistic', 'urban', 'bi-sexual', '.a', 'film', 'maker', '-taking', 'trip', 'Christian', 'farm', 'rural', 'Alaska', 'make', 'contact', 'brother', 'Marc', 'first', 'are', 'irreconcilable', 'differences', 'Julia', 'Marc', 'accept', 'Lesbian', 'lifestyle', 'do', 'Julia', 'bent', 'convincing', 'Marc', 'wrong', 'should', 'least', 'come', 'back', 'civilization', 'Gradually', 'accept', 'fact', 'Marc', 'happy', 'where', 'still', 'sister', 'even', 'beliefs', 'are', 'lovely', 'shots', 'farm', 'see', 'Julia', 'romping', 'grass', 'new', 'born', 'puppies', 'learning', 'fish', 'shoot', 'Marc', 'film', 'others', 'as', 'well', 'Marc', 'sincere', 'questioning', 'beliefs', 'smart', 'fierce', 'questioning', 'same', 'time', 'open', 'honest', 'applaud', 'way', 'confronted', 'one', 'beliefs', 'respectful', 'way', 'even', 'became', 'affectionate', 'humorous.Later', 'film', 'Marc', 'Julia', 'mother', 'great', 'aunt', 'New', 'York', 'time', 'Julia', 'mother', 'seem', 'have', 'come', 'lot', 'supporting', 'Marc', 'doing', 'what', 'happy.The', 'film', 'ended', 'way', 'honored', 'everyone', 'choices', 'was', 'truly', 'heartening', 'see', 'how', 'people', 'addressed', 'problems', 'open', 'minded', 'way', 'seemed', 'bring', 'closer', 'together', 'had', 'been', 'long', 'time']",Brother Born Again

1026377,A1TK6WNUIAEQRU,B000JGEXFS,stoic,"[5, 5]","A Christian is obligated to help a ""sister in Christ,"" but what about a biological sister? That is the question at the heart of the documentary Brother Born Again.The other night, my infant daughter wouldn't sleep. So I stayed up with her and watched Brother Born Again. The film concerns Julia Pimsleur, a woman from New York City who attempts to reestablish contact with her brother, Marc. The two siblings lost contact after Marc became a born-again Christian and moved into a Christian community called The Farm in rural Alaska. Julia's attempts to reestablish her relationship with Marc are complicated by two facts. First, the Pimsleur family is Jewish. Second, Julia is openly bisexual.One interesting aspect of the film is that it juxtaposes secular New York City with the ascetic Farm in Alaska. First, the viewer sees Julia discussing her life in New York; then Julia travels to see Marc in Alaska; finally, Marc visits his family in New York. The sharp contrast in these two settings intrigues the viewer.Marc is an interesting character, but he remains a bit mysterious at the film's end. He explains why he thought that he needed more meaning in his life, but I never understood why fundamentalist Christianity was the path that he chose to follow. Perhaps I am asking too much of the film, however, as religious belief often defies conventional explanations.A commendable aspect of the film is that while Julia explains her feelings about her brother and the hurt that his absence from her life causes, the film does a good job of not judging either person. This is a difficult task, given the charged topics that the film explores. I liked the fact that the filmmakers respected their viewers enough to allow them to draw their own conclusions. Julia strikes the viewer as someone who earnestly wants a better relationship with her brother and the viewer cheers for her to succeed.Brother Born Again offers few easy answers as to how we can bridge the gap between religious and secular Americans, but it offers much food for thought and it profiles some likeable people.",4,"I will help my brothers and sisters in Christ, because they are my brothers and sisters. - Joseph B Lightfoot",1295222400,"01 17, 2011",2011,2085,"['Christian', 'obligated', 'help', 'sister', 'Christ', 'what', 'biological', 'sister', 'question', 'heart', 'documentary', 'Brother', 'Born', 'Again.The', 'other', 'night', 'infant', 'daughter', 'would', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'stayed', 'up', 'watched', 'Brother', 'Born', 'Again', 'film', 'concerns', 'Julia', 'Pimsleur', 'woman', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'who', 'attempts', 'reestablish', 'contact', 'brother', 'Marc', 'two', 'siblings', 'lost', 'contact', 'Marc', 'became', 'born-again', 'Christian', 'moved', 'Christian', 'community', 'called', 'Farm', 'rural', 'Alaska', 'Julia', 'attempts', 'reestablish', 'relationship', 'Marc', 'are', 'complicated', 'two', 'facts', 'First', 'Pimsleur', 'family', 'Jewish', 'Second', 'Julia', 'openly', 'bisexual.One', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'film', 'secular', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'ascetic', 'Farm', 'Alaska', 'First', 'viewer', 'Julia', 'discussing', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'then', 'Julia', 'travels', 'see', 'Marc', 'Alaska', 'finally', 'Marc', 'family', 'New', 'York', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'two', 'settings', 'viewer.Marc', 'interesting', 'character', 'bit', 'mysterious', 'film', 'end', 'why', 'thought', 'needed', 'more', 'meaning', 'life', 'never', 'understood', 'why', 'fundamentalist', 'Christianity', 'was', 'path', 'chose', 'follow', 'Perhaps', 'am', 'asking', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'however', 'religious', 'belief', 'often', 'conventional', 'explanations.A', 'commendable', 'aspect', 'film', 'Julia', 'feelings', 'brother', 'hurt', 'absence', 'life', 'causes', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'not', 'judging', 'person', 'difficult', 'task', 'given', 'charged', 'topics', 'film', 'liked', 'fact', 'filmmakers', 'respected', 'viewers', 'enough', 'allow', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions', 'Julia', 'viewer', 'someone', 'who', 'earnestly', 'better', 'relationship', 'brother', 'viewer', 'cheers', 'succeed.Brother', 'Born', 'Again', 'few', 'easy', 'answers', 'how', 'can', 'bridge', 'gap', 'religious', 'secular', 'Americans', 'much', 'food', 'thought', 'likeable', 'people']",Brother Born Again
