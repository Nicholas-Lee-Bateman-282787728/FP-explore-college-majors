485487,A1WXCMB52BON8N,6305970955,A Customer,"[5, 5]","In this very watchable documentary Werner Herzog pays tribute to the late Klaus Kinski, who played the lead in five of Herzog's films. This is Herzog's side of the story, of course, as Kinski is no longer around give his version.A Peruvian actor from 'Aguirre' describes Kinski as ""a diabolical character."" In one memorable scene, Herzog tells a very uptight, bourgeois couple about what Kinski used to get up to in their house when he lived there in the 1950s. He once locked himself in the bathroom for two days, and smashed it up so thoroughly you could sift through it with a tennis racket. ""I never thought it was possible someone could rave for 48 hours,"" Herzog tells the couple, who try to hide their shock and disapproval.Kinski was a genius - an intuitive actor, highly professional when not possessed by megalomaniacal psychosis. Occasionally he even showed warmth and camaraderie.But other times he screamed in Herzog's face for literally hours because his coffee was lukewarm. Once he fired a gun at random through the wall of a hut, shooting the thumb off another actor. Kinski's ravings were a real problem for the Amazonian Indians who starred alongside him in 'Fitzcarraldo', and they made a serious offer to Herzog to kill him. Herzog himself threatened to shoot Kinski, yet it was this very threat which wrung the amazing final scene of 'Aguirre' out of him.One is reminded of George Orwell's essay on Salvador Dali - namely, how much bad behaviour do you tolerate in a gifted artist? In Kinski's case I would tolerate a fair bit.Herzog ends by comparing Kinski and himself to two critical masses, dangerous to come into contact with each other. Despite (or because of) this, they created 'Fitzcarraldo' (one of the greatest films ever made), the mesmerising 'Aguirre', the incredible 'Nosferatu' remake, and two other films. Few other actors have approached the intensity of Kinski, and this documentary is a fitting tribute to him.",4,A few things you should know about 'My Best Fiend',1263168000,"01 11, 2010",2010,1952,"['very', 'watchable', 'documentary', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'tribute', 'late', 'Klaus', 'Kinski', 'who', 'played', 'lead', 'five', 'Herzog', 'films', 'Herzog', 'side', 'story', 'course', 'Kinski', 'no', 'longer', 'around', 'give', 'version.A', 'Peruvian', 'actor', ""'Aguirre"", 'describes', 'Kinski', 'diabolical', 'character', 'one', 'memorable', 'scene', 'Herzog', 'very', 'uptight', 'bourgeois', 'couple', 'what', 'Kinski', 'used', 'get', 'up', 'house', 'when', 'lived', 'there', '1950s', 'once', 'locked', 'bathroom', 'two', 'days', 'smashed', 'up', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'could', 'sift', 'tennis', 'racket', 'never', 'thought', 'was', 'possible', 'someone', 'could', 'rave', '48', 'hours', 'Herzog', 'couple', 'who', 'try', 'hide', 'shock', 'disapproval.Kinski', 'was', 'genius', 'intuitive', 'actor', 'highly', 'professional', 'when', 'not', 'possessed', 'megalomaniacal', 'psychosis', 'Occasionally', 'even', 'showed', 'warmth', 'camaraderie.But', 'other', 'times', 'screamed', 'Herzog', 'face', 'literally', 'hours', 'coffee', 'was', 'lukewarm', 'Once', 'fired', 'gun', 'random', 'wall', 'hut', 'shooting', 'thumb', 'actor', 'Kinski', 'ravings', 'were', 'real', 'problem', 'Amazonian', 'Indians', 'who', 'starred', 'alongside', ""'Fitzcarraldo"", 'made', 'serious', 'offer', 'Herzog', 'kill', 'Herzog', 'threatened', 'shoot', 'Kinski', 'yet', 'was', 'very', 'threat', 'wrung', 'amazing', 'final', 'scene', ""'Aguirre"", 'him.One', 'reminded', 'George', 'Orwell', 'essay', 'Salvador', 'Dali', 'namely', 'how', 'much', 'bad', 'behaviour', 'do', 'tolerate', 'gifted', 'artist', 'Kinski', 'case', 'would', 'tolerate', 'fair', 'bit.Herzog', 'ends', 'comparing', 'Kinski', 'two', 'critical', 'masses', 'dangerous', 'come', 'contact', 'other', 'created', ""'Fitzcarraldo"", 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'mesmerising', ""'Aguirre"", 'incredible', 'remake', 'two', 'other', 'films', 'Few', 'other', 'actors', 'have', 'approached', 'intensity', 'Kinski', 'documentary', 'fitting', 'tribute']",Kinski: My Best Fiend
485488,A4VH04TA14CPE,6305970955,"Angry Mofo ""angrymofo""","[9, 10]","Here's what Klaus Kinski wrote about Werner Herzog in hisautobiography:""Herzog is a miserable, spiteful, envious, stingy, stinking, money-hungry, malicious, sadistic, insidious, backstabbing, blackmailing, cowardly person, and a liar through and through. His so-called talent is nothing more than torturing helpless creatures and, if necessary, putting them to death or simply murdering them. No one and nothing interests him but his lousy career as a so-called filmmaker. Driven by a pathological addiction to cause a sensation, he himself provokes the most senseless difficulties and dangers and puts the safety and even the lives of others on the line -- only so he can later say that he, Herzog, achieved the seemingly impossible."" (This goes on for pages.)Herzog mentions these passages in ""My Best Fiend,"" holds up a copy of Kinski's book, and says that he ought to read from it...but he never does. Instead, Herzog says that, actually, he ghost-wrote those hate-filled passages for Kinski (zing!). But he never quotes them. It is telling.Things like this happen all the time throughout the film. I don't mind that Herzog focuses on thefive filmshe made with Kinski -- those are Kinski's most famous performances, and Herzog would know more about them than anyone else. But, for instance, toward the end of his life, Kinski was obsessed with making afilmabout the famous violinist Paganini, with whom he personally identified. Eventually he was able to make it, but it was the only film he ever directed, and the last film he ever acted in. Herzog mentions it in ""My Best Fiend,"" but he doesn't show any excerpts from it. All he says about it is that the script was unfilmable, and that Kinski had already exhausted himself by that point.I am perfectly willing to suppose that Herzog is right, and that ""Paganini"" is a bad film. In fact I'm sure that's the case -- Kinski had no directorial experience, plus his notorious lack of restraint probably wouldn't translate into good directing. Also, it's clear from Kinski's autobiography that Kinski's interest in Paganini was driven by a badly-concealed desire to exalt himself. (You can see this in ""Cobra Verde"" too, although that's a brilliant film.) But still. ""Paganini"" was Kinski's only directorial effort, and he certainly put a lot of time and emotion into it. Whatever its ultimate artistic merit, clearly this project was extremely important to Kinski, and surely any attempt to understand him should at least briefly look at it. Maybe Herzog could even show an example of why it was such a bad film, and thereby make a larger point about why Kinski was unable to harness his own talents by himself. But he doesn't. Why? It's certainly not because he couldn't get the rights to it -- if he could find that obscure footage of Kinski's ""Jesus"" performance, he could surely get a clip from ""Paganini,"" a failure that no one wanted to distribute for years. But he doesn't forget to mention that Kinski allegedly asked him to direct ""Paganini,"" and that he refused. Hmm.Herzog also visits a photographer who took many pictures of Kinski on set. This scene feels like mutual back-slapping, rather than a discussion of Kinski. Sure, they explain Kinski's ability to manoeuvre in front of the camera during the filming of ""Aguirre,"" but most of the time, the conversation goes along the lines of, ""Oh Werner, it was hard work, but you did it."" ""Oh yes, I did, and you have the proof."" ""Yes, that was your role and you did it with bravado."" ""Oh, yes, it sure was."" Then Kinski is shown throwing a tantrum on the set of ""Fitzcarraldo.""There are scattered tidbits about Kinski's acting style, and a couple of clips, mostly from Herzog's films. There's one non-Herzog clip of Kinski playing a cruel military officer that illustrates how he could use subtle realism to strengthen his ""demonic"" roles. But that's all: for instance, there's nothing from Kinski's brief appearance in ""Doctor Zhivago,"" the only watchable scene in that otherwise dreadful film. On the plus side, there are a couple of interviews with Kinski's fellow actors. Eva Mattes and Claudia Cardinale both found Kinski to be a sweet and considerate man. Eva Mattes says so many nice things about Kinski that Herzog hurries to turn the conversation back to himself.Watching this film, I thought that the Herzog/Kinski feud never ended, and that the real purpose of the film is to define Kinski's legacy entirely in Herzog's terms. The tone Herzog chooses for his anecdotes is exactly the tone that would discredit Kinski most. Instead of reading from Kinski's book, Herzog remarks, with all the good humour in the world, that all the abuse therein was actually Herzog's own idea. This remark is brilliantly unanswerable -- if you believe it, there's simply no way to take Kinski seriously anymore. Herzog's numerous remarks about Kinski's ""posing"" and ""insipid beliefs"" are in a similar vein. Herzog casually says that he showed Kinski how to act in many scenes, and that he could have played the parts himself. The film also reproduces Herzog's rant about the jungle from ""Burden of Dreams,"" even though it has nothing to do with Kinski. Sure, Herzog praises Kinski's talent, but he leaves no doubt as to who the real master was.I can understand if Herzog wanted to even the score, after all the things Kinski said about him over the years. But in some sense, Kinski's hatred was boyishly naive compared to this film. Looking at Herzog's genial smile in ""My Best Fiend,"" you wonder whether Kinski might have been on to something in his description of Herzog. If you are interested in Kinski, read the autobiography. It's just as unreliable as a source of facts, but it reveals more of his character.",3,"Good humour, tipped with venom.",1244246400,"06 6, 2009",2009,5719,"['Here', 'what', 'Klaus', 'Kinski', 'wrote',

485492,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,6305970955,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[0, 0]","Werner Herzog's 1999 documentary, Klaus Kinski: My Best Fiend, is yet another in the dazzling array of Herzog documentary, or documentary-like, films. This one follows his turbulent friendship and creative partnership with the legendary German actor Klaus Kinski. Herzog also serves as narrator, in German (with English subtitles, or dubbed into English). In the 1970s and 1980s the pair collaborated to make five indelibly memorable great films: Aguirre: The Wrath Of God (1972), Nosferatu: Phantom Of The Night (1979), Woyzek (1979), Fitzcarraldo (1982), and Cobra Verde (1988).In a sense, this film is pure hagiography, only in wink and a nod reverse, as Herzog proudly cements Kinski's reputation as the madman of 20th Century film; but in the hands of any other director that's all this film would be, schmaltzy hagiography. In the capable hands of Herzog, this film is a memorable experience in its own right.... The film also has other unexpected moments of fun and pleasure, including bizarre outtakes from a supposed earlier version of Fitzcarraldo, starring Jason Robards as Fitzcarraldo, with a goofy Mick Jagger as his even odder sidekick. Whether or not this is true footage, or was merely done as a gag, is left to the viewer's imagination, but it's hard to imagine that Herzog would have ever wanted to make such a film.Kinski died in 1991, in Marin County, California, at the age of sixty-five, just three years after his last collaboration with Herzog on Cobra Verde, yet Herzog seems to never have gotten over it, for the better or the worse. The whole film, despite its mockery and offbeat tone, is a most loving tribute of one artist to another, even as Herzog claims, `'Every gray hair on my head I call Kinski.' Yet, the two men and artists seemed to bring out the best in each other, for Kinski's career long predated Herzog's, and included small roles in epics like Doctor Zhivago, but no one today recalls a single role of Kinski's outside the Herzog milieu. That, alone, sums up why this documentary is a must see for Herzog fans, and fans of cinema.",4,Excellent doc,1221350400,"09 14, 2008",2008,2076,"['Werner', 'Herzog', '1999', 'documentary', 'Klaus', 'Kinski', 'Best', 'Fiend', 'yet', 'dazzling', 'array', 'Herzog', 'documentary', 'documentary-like', 'films', 'one', 'turbulent', 'friendship', 'creative', 'partnership', 'legendary', 'German', 'actor', 'Klaus', 'Kinski', 'Herzog', 'also', 'narrator', 'German', 'English', 'subtitles', 'dubbed', 'English', '1970s', '1980s', 'pair', 'collaborated', 'make', 'five', 'indelibly', 'memorable', 'great', 'films', 'Aguirre', 'Wrath', 'God', '1972', 'Nosferatu', 'Phantom', 'Night', '1979', 'Woyzek', '1979', 'Fitzcarraldo', '1982', 'Cobra', 'Verde', '1988', '.In', 'sense', 'film', 'pure', 'hagiography', 'only', 'wink', 'nod', 'reverse', 'Herzog', 'proudly', 'Kinski', 'reputation', 'madman', '20th', 'Century', 'film', 'hands', 'other', 'director', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'schmaltzy', 'hagiography', 'capable', 'hands', 'Herzog', 'film', 'memorable', 'experience', 'own', 'right', 'film', 'also', 'other', 'unexpected', 'moments', 'fun', 'pleasure', 'including', 'bizarre', 'outtakes', 'supposed', 'earlier', 'version', 'Fitzcarraldo', 'starring', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'Fitzcarraldo', 'goofy', 'Mick', 'Jagger', 'even', 'odder', 'sidekick', 'not', 'true', 'footage', 'was', 'merely', 'done', 'gag', 'left', 'viewer', 'imagination', 'hard', 'imagine', 'Herzog', 'would', 'have', 'ever', 'wanted', 'make', 'such', 'film.Kinski', 'died', '1991', 'Marin', 'County', 'California', 'age', 'sixty-five', 'just', 'three', 'years', 'last', 'collaboration', 'Herzog', 'Cobra', 'Verde', 'yet', 'Herzog', 'never', 'have', 'gotten', 'better', 'worse', 'whole', 'film', 'mockery', 'offbeat', 'tone', 'most', 'loving', 'tribute', 'one', 'artist', 'even', 'Herzog', 'gray', 'hair', 'head', 'call', 'Kinski', 'Yet', 'two', 'men', 'artists', 'seemed', 'bring', 'out', 'best', 'other', 'Kinski', 'career', 'long', 'predated', 'Herzog', 'included', 'small', 'roles', 'epics', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'one', 'today', 'single', 'role', 'Kinski', 'Herzog', 'milieu', 'alone', 'sums', 'up', 'why', 'documentary', 'must', 'see', 'Herzog', 'fans', 'fans', 'cinema']",Kinski: My Best Fiend

Director Werner Herzog does a bit of self-absorbed navel-gazing and a lot of tall tale-spinning in this retrospective of his love-hate artistic partnership with actor Klaus Kinski (Urban legend puts both men literally plotting the other's murder at one time or another). Of course, we all know that ""dead men tell no tales"", (uh-Kinski did die of natural causes, far as we know) so we have to acknowledge the point-of-view as a bit lopsided from the outset; although to his credit Herzog does consult a couple of Kinski's leading ladies, who seem more willing to recall examples of Kinski's kinder, gentler (and lucid) moments (Most backstage footage of Kinski included shows the actor in ""screaming tantrum"" mode, which can paint a somewhat one-dimensional portrait.) As some reviewers have said, it does help if you have previously viewed the pair's more mercurial collaborations first, namely ""Fitzcarraldo"" and ""Aguirre, The Wrath Of God"", as both projects mirror the pathos and bathos of the real life relationship. Ultimately, the film begs the question: Are any great artists ever ""normal"" people anyway? From Mozart to Brando, history seems to bear out that when it comes to the creative arts, there is frequently a fine line between ""being a genius"" and ""needing to be locked up"". Final scene is an unexpectedly loving and beautiful coda which brought tears to this viewer's eyes.

It is hard to imagine two people more different than Herzog and Kinski: ""...stone and waves, the coldest ice and hottest flames have more in common, differ less"" but they both were driven and obsessed artists. Famous for his wild and ferocious talent and temperament to match, Kinski was incredibly difficult to work with. He wrote about himself, ""I am a wild animal born in captivity, in a zoo but where beast would have claws, I have talent"". Kinski's talent was fully realized in five films that he made with Werner Herzog over a fifteen-year working period, starting with astounding ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God"" (1973), and then following with ""Fitzcarraldo,"" ""Nosferatu"" (1979), inspired by Murnau's silent vampire classic; ""Woyzeck"" (1979), about a 19th century army private who seems mad to others because he looks and acts so differently from them, and ""Cobra Verde"" (1988). It is impossible to imagine any other actor starring in these films and they are without doubt the best Kinski ever made (and he made hundreds of films). Thanks to the Herzog's documentary we are able to learn what exactly went on behind the stunning images and unforgettable performances. According to Herzog, ""people like Marlon Brando are just kindergarden comparing to Kinski. He is mad and unpredictable."" They liked each other, they hated each other, and they respected each other at the same time making plans to murder each other. Kinski, who respected Herzog, and valued his friendship, confessed to the director that in his autobiography he would describe their relationship in not very flattering terms - otherwise, the crowd would not read it. Herzog recalls how they both would sit together at the bench after the shooting and discuss what Kinski would write in his book. I am curious if they discussed and agreed upon the following passage and if Herzog helped Kinski with some of the colorful metaphors: ""I absolutely despise this murderous Herzog! Huge red ants should p**s into his lying eyes, gobble up his balls, penetrate his a**hole and eat his guts.""Even after watching the fascinating documentary, it is difficult to fully understand the relationship between two giants but as Herzog admits, the only thing that counts is what we see on the screen and what we see is amazing.",4,"Werner Herzog: Every grey hair on my head, I call Kinski.",1172793600,"03 2, 2007",2007,2564,"['documentary', 'made', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'legendary', 'love-hate', 'relationship', 'director', 'who', 'was', 'ready', 'climb', 'Hell', 'movie', 'border-line', 'insane', 'genius', 'actor', 'Klaus', 'Kinski', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'creatures', 'Hell', 'Herzog', 'had', 'face', 'hard', 'imagine', 'two', 'people', 'more', 'different', 'Herzog', 'Kinski', 'stone', 'waves', 'coldest', 'ice', 'hottest', 'flames', 'have', 'more', 'common', 'differ', 'less', 'were', 'driven', 'obsessed', 'artists', 'Famous', 'wild', 'ferocious', 'talent', 'temperament', 'match', 'Kinski', 'was', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'work', 'wrote', 'am', 'wild', 'animal', 'born', 'captivity', 'zoo', 'where', 'beast', 'would', 'have', 'claws', 'have', 'talent', 'Kinski', 'talent', 'was', 'fully', 'realized', 'five', 'films', 'made', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'fifteen-year', 'working', 'period', 'starting', 'astounding', 'Aguirre', 'Wrath', 'God', '1973', 'then', 'following', 'Fitzcarraldo', 'Nosferatu', '1979', 'inspired', 'Murnau', 'silent', 'vampire', 'classic', 'Woyzeck', '1979', '19th', 'century', 'army', 'private', 'who', 'mad', 'others', 'so', 'differently', 'Cobra', 'Verde', '1988', 'impossible', 'imagine', 'other', 'actor', 'starring', 'films', 'are', 'doubt', 'best', 'Kinski', 'ever', 'made', 'made', 'hundreds', 'films', 'Thanks', 'Herzog', 'documentary', 'are', 'able', 'learn', 'what', 'exactly', 'went', 'stunning', 'images', 'unforgettable', 'performances', 'According', 'Herzog', 'people', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'are', 'just', 'kindergarden', 'comparing', 'Kinski', 'mad', 'unpredictable', 'liked', 'other', 'hated', 'other', 'respected', 'other', 'same', 'time', 'making', 'plans', 'murder', 'other', 'Kinski', 'who', 'respected', 'Herzog', 'valued', 'friendship', 'confessed', 'director', 'autobiography', 'would', 'describe', 'relationship', 'not', 'very', 'flattering', 'terms', 'otherwise', 'crowd', 'would', 'not', 'read', 'Herzog', 'how', 'would', 'sit', 'together', 'bench', 'shooting', 'discuss', 'what', 'Kinski', 'would', 'write', 'book', 'am', 'curious', 'discussed', 'agreed', 'following', 'passage', 'Herzog', 'helped', 'Kinski', 'colorful', 'metaphors', 'absolutely', 'despise', 'murderous', 'Herzog', 'Huge', 'red', 'ants', 'should', 'p**s', 'lying', 'eyes', 'gobble', 'up', 'balls', 'penetrate', 'a**hole', 'eat', 'guts', 'Even', 'watching', 'fascinating', 'documentary', 'difficult', 'fully', 'understand', 'relationship', 'two', 'giants', 'Herzog', 'only', 'thing', 'what', 'see', 'screen', 'what', 'see', 'amazing']",Kinski: My Best Fiend

Herzog and Kinski were two distinctly different personalities who often clashed, but when they came together they formed a third entity capable of creating incredible cinematic experiences. Kinski was brash, bombastic and given to horrendous rants and tantrums that kept most directors from working with him more than once--a completely egocentric artist who demanded being the center of attention at all times. Herzog by comparison is quiet and self-controlled, but he talks matter of factly of having planned to kill Kinski, and one piece of film shot on location shows him more than willing to go toe to toe with Kinski in a screaming match. But there is definitely a large ego at work in Herzog as well. So different and yet so much alike. A little madness and a lot of ego in them both.Herzog seems frequently drawn to films that deal with madness, from AGUIRRE THE WRATH OF GOD, which starred Kinski, to his documentary GRIZZLY MAN about Timothy Treadwell who mistakenly believed his knowledge of the bears would protect him. However he also seems drawn to another type of film akin to the mockumentary. The best example being INCIDENT AT LOCH NESS where he supposedly records an expedition researching the famous monster, but is everything what it seems to be? I think that perhaps MY BEST FIEND is a happy marriage of these two cinematic preoccupations of Herzog's, because in MY BEST FIEND there's truth and there's some deception with a big wink. Even the film's title seems to be a hint that there is more here than meets the eye; A deception perhaps aimed at adding to the legendary relationship that existed between the two men during Kinski's lifetime which will probably grow to epic proportions now that he's gone-- something that I'm certain Kinski would enjoy immensely and approve of completely.",5,Fiend or Foe?,1243814400,"06 1, 2009",2009,1939,"['BEST', 'FIEND', 'director', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'love', 'letter', 'long', 'time', 'star', 'ocasional', 'friend', 'German', 'actor', 'Klaus', 'Kinski', 'Herzog', 'Kinski', 'were', 'two', 'distinctly', 'different', 'personalities', 'who', 'often', 'clashed', 'when', 'came', 'together', 'formed', 'third', 'entity', 'capable', 'creating', 'incredible', 'cinematic', 'experiences', 'Kinski', 'was', 'brash', 'bombastic', 'given', 'horrendous', 'rants', 'tantrums', 'kept', 'most', 'directors', 'working', 'more', 'once', 'completely', 'egocentric', 'artist', 'who', 'demanded', 'being', 'center', 'attention', 'times', 'Herzog', 'comparison', 'quiet', 'self-controlled', 'matter', 'factly', 'having', 'planned', 'kill', 'Kinski', 'one', 'piece', 'film', 'shot', 'location', 'more', 'willing', 'go', 'toe', 'toe', 'Kinski', 'screaming', 'match', 'definitely', 'large', 'ego', 'work', 'Herzog', 'as', 'well', 'different', 'yet', 'so', 'much', 'alike', 'little', 'madness', 'lot', 'ego', 'both.Herzog', 'frequently', 'drawn', 'films', 'deal', 'madness', 'AGUIRRE', 'THE', 'WRATH', 'OF', 'GOD', 'starred', 'Kinski', 'documentary', 'GRIZZLY', 'MAN', 'Timothy', 'Treadwell', 'who', 'mistakenly', 'believed', 'knowledge', 'bears', 'would', 'protect', 'However', 'also', 'drawn', 'type', 'film', 'akin', 'mockumentary', 'best', 'example', 'being', 'INCIDENT', 'AT', 'LOCH', 'NESS', 'where', 'supposedly', 'records', 'expedition', 'researching', 'famous', 'monster', 'everything', 'what', 'be', 'think', 'perhaps', 'MY', 'BEST', 'FIEND', 'happy', 'marriage', 'two', 'cinematic', 'preoccupations', 'Herzog', 'MY', 'BEST', 'FIEND', 'truth', 'deception', 'big', 'wink', 'Even', 'film', 'title', 'be', 'hint', 'more', 'here', 'eye', 'deception', 'perhaps', 'aimed', 'adding', 'legendary', 'relationship', 'existed', 'two', 'men', 'Kinski', 'lifetime', 'will', 'probably', 'grow', 'epic', 'proportions', 'now', 'gone', 'something', ""'m"", 'certain', 'Kinski', 'would', 'enjoy', 'immensely', 'approve', 'completely']",Kinski: My Best Fiend
485502,AYCJSA9HR7TKO,6305970955,Kerry Walters,"[0, 0]","Werner Herzog, one of the greatest directors of our time, and Klaus Kinski, one of its greatest actors, collaborated with one another in five films.  Both were geniuses, both stubbornly protective of their artistic integrity, and both slightly egomaniac (actually, more than ""slightly"").  This documentary, made by Herzog, is an effort on his part, after Kinski's death, to make sense of their relationship.Herzog's conclusion is that they complemented and genuinely liked one another, although it's also the case that each of them experienced episodes of great rage and hatred for one another.  In fact, both admitted to wanting to kill the other at times.  But together they managed to make some of the greatest films of the century.Kinski comes across as an absolutely fascinating character:  possessed of a hair trigger and ferocious temper that could explode unexpectedly, he was the terror of camera crews, fellow actors, and sometimes Herzog himself.  Curiously, Herzog first met Kinski when Kinski was a struggling young actor and Herzog a boy of fifteen.  Kinski stayed in Herzog's mother's boarding house in Munich.  Even then his temper was apparent.  On one occasion he shut himself up in a bathroom for 48 hours, ranting, raving, and destroying until, as Herzog says, every piece of porcelain in the bathroom was so shattered that you could filter it through a tennis racket.Although in the middle of wild nature (South America and Africa) for three of Herzog's films, and although he liked to say how much of a ""natural man"" he was, Kinski in fact feared and disliked nature.  He had a germ phobia, which caused him to dislike both human contact and the messiness of the jungle.  He was a terrible bully, but like most bullies was also a bit of a coward.But the film isn't uniformly critical of Kinski, as an earlier reviewer says.  In fact, it's an honest and fascinating look at the wellspring of his genius.  Herzog speculates several times that the intense temper tantrums were Kinski's way of purging himself before he went before the camera--a way of emptying his mind and spirit to enter fully into the moment once in character.Well worth watching, both for Herzog and Kinski fans, and those interested in artistic genius.",5,The complexity of genius,1214956800,"07 2, 2008",2008,2243,"['Werner', 'Herzog', 'one', 'greatest', 'directors', 'time', 'Klaus', 'Kinski', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'collaborated', 'one', 'five', 'films', 'were', 'geniuses', 'stubbornly', 'protective', 'artistic', 'integrity', 'slightly', 'egomaniac', 'actually', 'more', 'slightly', 'documentary', 'made', 'Herzog', 'effort', 'part', 'Kinski', 'death', 'make', 'sense', 'relationship.Herzog', 'conclusion', 'complemented', 'genuinely', 'liked', 'one', 'also', 'case', 'experienced', 'episodes', 'great', 'rage', 'hatred', 'one', 'fact', 'admitted', 'wanting', 'kill', 'other', 'times', 'together', 'managed', 'make', 'greatest', 'films', 'century.Kinski', 'across', 'absolutely', 'fascinating', 'character', 'possessed', 'hair', 'trigger', 'ferocious', 'temper', 'could', 'explode', 'unexpectedly', 'was', 'terror', 'camera', 'crews', 'fellow', 'actors', 'sometimes', 'Herzog', 'Curiously', 'Herzog', 'first', 'met', 'Kinski', 'when', 'Kinski', 'was', 'struggling', 'young', 'actor', 'Herzog', 'boy', 'fifteen', 'Kinski', 'stayed', 'Herzog', 'mother', 'boarding', 'house', 'Munich', 'Even', 'then', 'temper', 'was', 'apparent', 'one', 'occasion', 'shut', 'up', 'bathroom', '48', 'hours', 'ranting', 'raving', 'destroying', 'Herzog', 'piece', 'porcelain', 'bathroom', 'was', 'so', 'shattered', 'could', 'filter', 'tennis', 'racket.Although', 'middle', 'wild', 'nature', 'South', 'America', 'Africa', 'three', 'Herzog', 'films', 'liked', 'say', 'how', 'much', 'natural', 'man', 'was', 'Kinski', 'fact', 'feared', 'disliked', 'nature', 'had', 'germ', 'phobia', 'caused', 'dislike', 'human', 'contact', 'messiness', 'jungle', 'was', 'terrible', 'bully', 'most', 'bullies', 'was', 'also', 'bit', 'coward.But', 'film', ""n't"", 'uniformly', 'critical', 'Kinski', 'earlier', 'reviewer', 'fact', 'honest', 'fascinating', 'look', 'wellspring', 'genius', 'Herzog', 'several', 'times', 'intense', 'temper', 'tantrums', 'were', 'Kinski', 'way', 'purging', 'went', 'camera', 'way', 'emptying', 'mind', 'spirit', 'enter', 'fully', 'moment', 'once', 'character.Well', 'watching', 'Herzog', 'Kinski', 'fans', 'interested', 'artistic', 'genius']",Kinski: My Best Fiend

Not that i wanted the Kinski myth to  be broken down, or have some great revelations about him as a human being,  actor, madman, i just wanted a little more than Herzog delivers. While i  like that it doesnt try to define Kinski and accepts the fact that he was  undefinable, many things to many people, i found this look back to be a  little lacking, a tad flat in presentation. A documentary about a force of  nature like Kinski should at least electrify or fascinate like the subject  did in his life. Instead, the movie is just a retread of what we have  already heard a hundred times before- insane, gentle, genius, self  absorbed, dangerous, caring.

It sets the tone for what is to come.  Director Werner Herzog reveals their fascinating working relationship in which he manipulated Kinski's madness for the camera.  Their collaboration resulted in such great movies as ""Aguirre, The Wrath of God,"" and ""Fitzcarraldo."" The fights and catastrophes that occured during both of these movie shoots on the Amazon brought great performances from Kinski, demonstrating that art can be the result of two artists at war with each other.

485505,A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ,6305970955,Robert Blake,"[6, 8]","There probably could never be anybody capable of making a documentary about Klaus Kinski other than Werner Herzog. After all, as the title emplies, Kinski was Herzog's best fiend. This is an endlessly fascinating portrait of an actor who was a genius, a madman and a tender soul. Herzog creates a rich film here that never bores. He doesn't turn it into a mournful memory where he might just sit in a chair and talk to a camera, no, he takes us to the locations where he and Kinski filmed, travels to visit crew members and friends and shows us unique behind the scenes footage. The beginning is shocking but intuitive, as Kinski gets into heated arguments with audience members during a performance as Jesus Christ. And if you look at it, shouldn't this be the way hecklers should be handled anyway? Kinski remains a fascinating figure through-out, a brilliant actor who could perfectly become a character and take over the screen. Herzog is a mad genius too and so his portrait of his best friend is really filled with depth and even touching at times. We see them filming in the harsh conditions they went up against to make the masterpieces ""Aguirre, The Wrath Of God"" and ""Fitzcarraldo."" We see Kinski and his famous tantrums as he chews out crew members and Herzog in truly violent-mouthed ways.... It is always interesting to hear Herzog talk about the making of the movies and there stunning vistas, like the amazon and Andes where the two mentioned films were made (we see the stunning sequence from the beginning of ""Aguirre"" where we see hundreds of Spanish conquistadors look like ants as they walk down an Andean slope). One thing the movie should be valued for is that Herzog does not only show the dark, crazy side of Kinski, he also shows the nice side. The last shot is truly memorable where Kinski is gently playing with a butterfly and we see his gentle, tender side. The movie is also comic, especially when we see two brilliant artists battle it out. It's funny to see that Kinski and Herzog loved and loathed each-other equally. ""My Best Fiend"" is a must for movie buffs, fans of Herzog or Kinski, and for anybody who is fascinated by films that explore unique minds. It is a fascinating, memorable piece of work.",5,"Comic, Fascinating, Filled With Brilliance.",1010275200,"01 6, 2002",2002,2235,"['probably', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'anybody', 'capable', 'making', 'documentary', 'Klaus', 'Kinski', 'other', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'title', 'emplies', 'Kinski', 'was', 'Herzog', 'best', 'fiend', 'endlessly', 'fascinating', 'portrait', 'actor', 'who', 'was', 'genius', 'madman', 'tender', 'soul', 'Herzog', 'rich', 'film', 'here', 'never', 'bores', ""n't"", 'turn', 'mournful', 'memory', 'where', 'might', 'just', 'sit', 'chair', 'talk', 'camera', 'locations', 'where', 'Kinski', 'filmed', 'travels', 'visit', 'crew', 'members', 'friends', 'unique', 'scenes', 'footage', 'beginning', 'shocking', 'intuitive', 'Kinski', 'heated', 'arguments', 'audience', 'members', 'performance', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'look', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'way', 'hecklers', 'should', 'be', 'handled', 'anyway', 'Kinski', 'fascinating', 'figure', 'through-out', 'brilliant', 'actor', 'who', 'could', 'perfectly', 'become', 'character', 'take', 'screen', 'Herzog', 'mad', 'genius', 'too', 'so', 'portrait', 'best', 'friend', 'really', 'filled', 'depth', 'even', 'touching', 'times', 'see', 'filming', 'harsh', 'conditions', 'went', 'up', 'make', 'masterpieces', 'Aguirre', 'Wrath', 'God', 'Fitzcarraldo', 'see', 'Kinski', 'famous', 'tantrums', 'out', 'crew', 'members', 'Herzog', 'truly', 'violent-mouthed', 'ways', 'always', 'interesting', 'hear', 'Herzog', 'talk', 'making', 'movies', 'stunning', 'vistas', 'amazon', 'Andes', 'where', 'two', 'mentioned', 'films', 'were', 'made', 'see', 'stunning', 'sequence', 'beginning', 'Aguirre', 'where', 'see', 'hundreds', 'Spanish', 'conquistadors', 'look', 'like', 'ants', 'walk', 'Andean', 'slope', 'One', 'thing', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'valued', 'Herzog', 'not', 'only', 'show', 'dark', 'crazy', 'side', 'Kinski', 'also', 'nice', 'side', 'last', 'shot', 'truly', 'memorable', 'where', 'Kinski', 'gently', 'playing', 'butterfly', 'see', 'gentle', 'tender', 'side', 'movie', 'also', 'comic', 'especially', 'when', 'see', 'two', 'brilliant', 'artists', 'battle', 'out', 'funny', 'see', 'Kinski', 'Herzog', 'loved', 'loathed', 'each-other', 'equally', 'Best', 'Fiend', 'must', 'movie', 'buffs', 'fans', 'Herzog', 'Kinski', 'anybody', 'who', 'fascinated', 'films', 'explore', 'unique', 'minds', 'fascinating', 'memorable', 'piece', 'work']",Kinski: My Best Fiend

They are deep art films that explore the extremes of human depravity:  megalomania, superhuman effort (for questionable causes), insanity, loss of self, murder.  He is like a raw, sharper-edged Bergman, whose country's fascist legacy has given him a perspective on horror and nihilism unavailable elsewhere, at least in art.  His greatest performer was, of course, Klaus Kinski.This is an amazing film of how these two talents met and collaborated and fought, riffing off eachother until exhaustion and then making outstanding performances.  If you could say there is genius in cinema, these two would certainly qualify.  What emerges is an intimate portrait of both, from Herzog's point of view.  They had roomed in the same house when younger, and Herzog's observations of him practicing - up to 10 hours a day - convinced him to go into cinema.Kinski comes off as one of Herzog's characters:  obsessed with perfection, focused in the manaical way that one would expect of a genius, he lived for his roles.  Here you witness what went into his performances, as managed by a great director.  The only thing that convinces you that KK was not completely insane was that he was so good on the set:  his point of view improved the quality whenever he offered ideas, his performances were perfection, even as he aggravated everyone around him.  That he was an egomaniac who became enraged if was not the center of attention is something we can all be glad we didn't experience.  Even Herzog admits that he planned to murder KK at one point. His native actors also had asked Herzog if he wanted them to kill Kinski.By the end of this documentary, I viewed them as symbiotic, both of them were the characters in the films.  It is a wonderful juxtaposition, with Herzog seeming to realize it at the end, commenting that he is in fact Fitzcarraldo.The title is curious.  While ""fiend"" sound like Feind, it is an inaccurate translation - it more exactly means ""enemy"".  There is a lot in the German that is poorly translated, in my hearing.Warmly recommended.
