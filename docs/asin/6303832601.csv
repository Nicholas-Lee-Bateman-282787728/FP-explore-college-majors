386536,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303832601,Andrew Ellington,"[12, 13]","I tried to find some fault with this movie, but I simply couldn't.  I tried to pick apart Geraldine Page's performance, but I truly can't.Why, you may ask, would I want to dislike this movie?Well, for the mere fact that Whoopi Goldberg gave the performance of her career in `The Color Purple' and Page stole her Oscar.  Sure, Goldberg got her Oscar in 1990 (despite Bening being the better supporting actress that year) but I think everyone under the sun knows deep down that that 1985 Best Actress Oscar should have been hers.  So, with that on my mind, I sat down to watch and criticize this small little film; but my end feelings on the film are far different from what I expected.`The Trip to Bountiful' tells the beautifully uplifting story of Carrie Watts, an elderly woman living with her son and daughter-in-law.  She is miserable, living under the sharp reign of her daughter-in-law Jessie Mae and she desires to see her old home in Bountiful before she dies.  Living in the prison her daughter-in-law has created for her is not the way in which she wishes to die.  Carrie hatches a plan to flee, hiding her social security check from Jessie Mae's greedy paws and making her way to the train station and heading out towards the place she fondly remembers as home.  Along the way she meets up with the tenderly compassionate Thelma and the sympathetic town Sheriff who offers to take her to see her abandoned home.`The Trip to Bountiful' is as sad as it is inspiring and it will leave you speechless by the films end.  This is the story of a woman who has been reduced to living a life she wouldn't wish on anyone, and the very thought of just seeing a place that brings her fond memories is enough to make her feel like a kid again, happy and care-free.  This woman's emotional journey is brought to life by Geraldine Page's fantastic performance (she is still second fiddle to Whoopi).  She really gathers behind this woman's every solitary emotion and fleshes it out before our very eyes.  She loves her son, and in a way she even loves her daughter-in-law, but she can't live the life they have set for her.  She can't take the fighting and the worrying and the constant feeling of fear in her own home.Page is supported by a nice cast of supporting actors, most notably John Heard who plays her son Ludie.  He does such a phenomenal job, especially in his final scene, of exposing the hard position he has been forced to reside in; pitted against his wife's demands and his mother's broken memories.  Carlin Glynn, Richard Bradford, Rebecca De Mornay and Kevin Cooney all deliver nice performances that elevate the films core.At the heart of this film there is a story about a woman journeying home.  Her home is different than she remembers.  The town is all but deserted; her friends are all passed and her home is barren, but that home is everything to her.  Her heart swells with joy at the prospect of just spending an hour within its rotten shell.  She desires nothing more than to have it become a part of her, for it represents everything she feels she has given up; everything she feels has been taken away from her.  `The Trip to Bountiful' is a beautifully sincere, soft and delicate film that will reach your heart and tug those strings and will quite possibly choke out a few tears.",5,The type of movie that stirs the soul...,1222819200,"10 1, 2008",2008,3308,"['tried', 'find', 'fault', 'movie', 'simply', 'could', ""n't"", 'tried', 'pick', 'apart', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'performance', 'truly', ""can't.Why"", 'may', 'ask', 'would', 'want', 'dislike', 'movie', 'Well', 'mere', 'fact', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'gave', 'performance', 'career', 'Color', 'Purple', 'Page', 'stole', 'Oscar', 'Sure', 'Goldberg', 'got', 'Oscar', '1990', 'Bening', 'being', 'better', 'supporting', 'actress', 'year', 'think', 'everyone', 'sun', 'deep', 'down', '1985', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'hers', 'So', 'mind', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'criticize', 'small', 'little', 'film', 'end', 'feelings', 'film', 'are', 'far', 'different', 'what', 'expected.', 'Trip', 'Bountiful', 'beautifully', 'uplifting', 'story', 'Carrie', 'Watts', 'elderly', 'woman', 'living', 'son', 'daughter-in-law', 'miserable', 'living', 'sharp', 'reign', 'daughter-in-law', 'Jessie', 'Mae', 'see', 'old', 'home', 'Bountiful', 'Living', 'prison', 'daughter-in-law', 'created', 'not', 'way', 'die', 'Carrie', 'plan', 'flee', 'hiding', 'social', 'security', 'check', 'Jessie', 'Mae', 'greedy', 'paws', 'making', 'way', 'train', 'station', 'heading', 'out', 'place', 'fondly', 'home', 'way', 'up', 'tenderly', 'compassionate', 'Thelma', 'sympathetic', 'town', 'Sheriff', 'who', 'take', 'see', 'abandoned', 'home.', 'Trip', 'Bountiful', 'as', 'sad', 'inspiring', 'will', 'leave', 'speechless', 'films', 'end', 'story', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'reduced', 'living', 'life', 'would', ""n't"", 'wish', 'anyone', 'very', 'thought', 'just', 'seeing', 'place', 'fond', 'memories', 'enough', 'make', 'feel', 'kid', 'again', 'happy', 'care-free', 'woman', 'emotional', 'journey', 'brought', 'life', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'still', 'second', 'fiddle', 'Whoopi', 'really', 'gathers', 'woman', 'solitary', 'emotion', 'fleshes', 'out', 'very', 'eyes', 'son', 'way', 'even', 'daughter-in-law', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'life', 'have', 'set', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'fighting', 'worrying', 'constant', 'feeling', 'fear', 'own', 'home.Page', 'supported', 'nice', 'cast', 'supporting', 'actors', 'most', 'notably', 'John', 'Heard', 'who', 'son', 'Ludie', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'especially', 'final', 'scene', 'exposing', 'hard', 'position', 'been', 'forced', 'reside', 'pitted', 'wife', 'demands', 'mother', 'broken', 'memories', 'Carlin', 'Glynn', 'Richard', 'Bradford', 'Rebecca', 'De', 'Mornay', 'Kevin', 'Cooney', 'deliver', 'nice', 'performances', 'elevate', 'films', 'core.At', 'heart', 'film', 'story', 'woman', 'journeying', 'home', 'home', 'different', 'remembers', 'town', 'deserted', 'friends', 'are', 'passed', 'home', 'barren', 'home', 'everything', 'heart', 'joy', 'prospect', 'just', 'spending', 'hour', 'rotten', 'shell', 'nothing', 'more', 'have', 'become', 'part', 'her', 'everything', 'given', 'up', 'everything', 'been', 'taken', 'away', 'Trip', 'Bountiful', 'beautifully', 'sincere', 'soft', 'delicate', 'film', 'will', 'reach', 'heart', 'tug', 'strings', 'will', 'quite', 'possibly', 'choke', 'out', 'few', 'tears']",Trip to Bountiful VHS

By the time the film ends, nothing much is resolved. It's all about the old dingbat who wants to take one last look at her childhood home. At the same time, I am just thinking of how relieved Rebecca De Mornay's character is by getting the hell out of dodge after her strange encounter with the loquacious blue-haired hen. I bet by the time she gets home she is exclaiming, with her wide eyes, to her parents, ""You wouldn't believe what the f happened to me in Houston."" Yeah, even more so is the inexplicable Oscar win for Geraldine Page who plays one of the worst movie characters I've had the displeasure of watching. She literally goes through every acting trick she can possibly find in the old book and then some more. Every scene with her is either cringeworthy or plain embarrassing.

The real stars here are Glynn and Heard, and it's a tossup as to which actor is better, for neither is as accessible as the Page role. Glynn's role is as a seeming bitch, but we never really believe that, as in several moments throughout the film we see she really does care for her mother. Heard's character never has problems showing he cares, but he is a classic hen-pecked type. Since abrasiveness and seeming cowardice are not valued traits, it's no wonder both Foote and the audience sympathize more with Mother Watts, and this is why she is the de facto lead, even if her tale is the least interesting, and most predictable, of the three- especially when we learn that two of Ludie's siblings died in that town, in childhood. The character played by DeMornay is, by contrast, merely a plot device to get inside Mother Watts. With that done, her exit from the film is anticlimactic.The film got mixed reviews on its release, but even those who praised it did so for the wrong reasons, lumping it in with lesser nostalgic schlock like The Color Purple and the later Driving Miss Daisy. There was also the critical cribbing regarding Mother Watts' first name, as well as some claims that the film has flashbacks, due to the opening credits scene where we see a young Mother Watts and child Ludie running through a field of flowers. But, since this is the opening shot, and is never repeated, it cannot be a flashback. The film could be considered a flashforward, but given the bulk of time spent in the film's present, this is ludicrous. It does, however, amply show the problems many critics have in dealing with art that does not conform to their preconceptions, nor the promotional material they are given. The film's main themes song, Softly And Tenderly, sung by Cynthia Clawson, is memorable, but scoring is not a strength of this film.The Trip To Bountiful has many great points and moments, but it is not a great film, for the translation between media is a difficult thing to pull off. But, the film shows the failure of much contemporary writing, with an over-reliance on diurnal description and rote explanation, whereas true characterization comes from observation- the viewer being to observe what and what not the character does, and how that has an effect on the character, even if the whole observational process is discreetly exhibited. This film is a great example of characterization at its finest, and even though it does not achieve overall greatness in this medium, it small failures point out the way that the truly great works of the filmic medium do achieve it. Thus, it recapitulates much of the learning process that the tercet of main characters undergoes.

Page was always at her best in a role like this. She gets fine support from John Heard and Rebecca de Mornay.  But the real treat is the performance from Carlin Glynn.

Based on the 50 year old play by Horton Foote, it tells of an elderly woman's quest to return one last time to her childhood home. Knowing her life is coming to a close, she gets on a Greyhound bus heading for a town (Bountiful, Texas) that no longer exists. Chased by her weakling of a son (John Heard) and his shrewish wife (Carlin Glynn), accompanied along the way by a gentle and kindly young lady (the lovely Rebecca De Mornay), who acts almost like her guardian angel, and framed at beginning and end by Cynthia Clawson's rendition of the hymn ""Softly and Tenderly"", ""Trip to Bountiful"" is truly an American classic. Geraldine Page deservedly won an Academy Award for this at the end of a long and illustrious career.MGM has released this on a double-sided DVD with the original 1.85:1 theatrical version (anamorphic) on one side and a fullscreen version (either open-matte or extracted from a super35) on the other. Picture quality is excellent with rich, natural colors and good black levels. There is very little dirt, the picture looks quite immaculate. Sound is the original 2.0 Mono but with excellent fidelity. My only disappointment is that this would have been the perfect opportunity to release a Special 20th Anniversary Edition. But I suppose MGM figured there would be no market for that. Shame. Still, we do have a 22 minute, brand new documentary entitled ""Return to Bountiful"" and the original theatrical trailer.

386552,A165QTRGCJVCZZ,6303832601,Elton T. Elliott,"[7, 7]","Put together a piece that has both a beautiful heartwarming story set in a slower more gracious time than now and the greatest actress to ever act on the American stage or movie screen and you have THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL.  The 1940's was a time when older people didn't have the option to be sent to nursing homes in America so that family members didn't need to be responsible for their elderly's welfare or for assuring that their last days could end with a certain amount of dignity.Carrie Watts, played perfectly by Geraldine Page had moved in with her lone surviving son and his wife because she had left her girlhood home when the land there was too worn out to provide her with a living after the death of her husband and two of her children.  After twenty years of being away from the tiny Texas town called Bountiful and six years of being cooped up in a two-room apartment in Houston, Texas, Carrie yearned to return to her ""home"" where she could dig in the dirt and make something grow again.  She has made several failed efforts at getting there already before the movie's opening and the strange dance that ensues between her and her son and daughter-in-law is her struggle to make her dream come true while the two of them make every effort to prevent it.TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL was Page's final performance as she died shortly after receiving the academy award for 1985's best actress.  Hers was an epoch of actresses who were trained to ""overact"" especially in movies.  I once heard Bette Davis say near the end of her life that the trouble with actors and actresses today was that they brought too much realism to their roles.  She and the actresses of her day were told to make their characters ""larger than life"", to maintain a certain distance from the audience.  Too much realism was frowned upon by directors of the day.  Geraldine Page though started out as a stage actress and her performances always rang true at their very core.  She never did or said anything on stage or screen that struck a wrong chord.  I believed her in every role and she was never better than she was in this her last movie.

I've had the VHS for years and I was happy to see the DVD available, and at a cheap price. Unfortunately, that price also meant that I wasn't going to see the extras that I have now come to expect from all DVDs.Geraldine Page won the Oscar for her role here, and she was up against Whoopi Goldberg's powerful performance in The Color Purple. They had it in for Spielberg, anyway, but at least you could say that Ms. Page's win was not a sympathy vote. She was brilliant as Carrie Watts. Fans of Bette Midler may recognize John Heard, who plays Carrie's impotent but sympathetic son as CeCe Bloom's husband in the film classic, ""Beaches"", which has also been re-released on DVD.I think a word or two has to be said about the haunting theme song, ""Softly and Tenderly"", sung so beautifully by gospel legend Cynthia Clawson. It appears on her album ""Immortal"", which by now may be available on CD from her website. But every time I drive to Texas and see the bluebonnets by the side of the road, I think of Ms. Clawson's beautiful voice. My wish for this DVD would have been for them to explain, in the relatively short ""making-of"" documentary, the music choices and how this song and this singer came to be chosen. It was an excellent decision, however it came about.The quality of the DVD was not quite up to standard in my opinion. It looks as if they just recorded it straight off the tape without any cleanup, colors seem dark and muddied in places. I had hoped this classic film would have been treated with better respect when it came time to digitize it. That having been said, four stars is a good score, and it's better to have it in digital form than not at all, even though I think I'll be hanging on to my VHS version.If there are any youngsters (under 30) who haven't seen this film or who were very young when this came out but love their grandmother or great-grandmother, they are in for a treat. Maybe they will come to view aging people with a little more compassion if they haven't been before now.

First rate cast - Rebecca DeMornay is moving as hell, and John Heard extra fine as Carrie Watts' son Ludie. Horton Foote crafted a perfect screenplay, intelligent and brave, itself a kind of paean to Page; it holds her sounds, and insights, already in place. Foote deals auspiciously in ribbons of moments actors are blessed to find once in a career. Geraldine Page deserved no less, and she, of course, rose to the occasion. The result is a caution to our complacency, a farewell performance so unaware of itself, and as beautiful as anything you'll ever see on film.

Gawlitta ""Coolmoan""","[4, 4]","The wonderful Page carries yet another film of sweetness, concern, tragedy, renewal...difficult to juggle, but not in the capable hands of Geraldine Page. When F. Murray Abraham annoucned her name he prefaced it by saying &#34;the best actress in the English language&#34;. Whoopi was visibly disappointed.What we have here is a leveled, progressive performance, guided by director Peter Masterson, of a woman at wit's end, alone, with memories that she can't shed. The Great Depression took a toll, and she, in her elderly years, took refuge with her son and his materialistic wife in Houston. Carrie Watts just wants to go home, one more time.She's more adventurous than anyone thinks, and we're up for a fun adventure of redemption and true heartfelt desire.It's a lovely film, in so many ways. Horton Foote wrote this specifically for Page as a stage show, and expanded it for the screen (receiving  an Oscar nom for screenplay). Page has moments of reflection that are profound and disturbing, and there are volumes of subtext, shown through her bright eyes; never bitter, always hopeful in her faith.The film is not preachy with religion, so much as it's all she can fall back on. Excellent performances from John Heard, Rebecca de Mornay and Carlin Glynn throw so many different emotions into this film, that I'll be surprised that, at the end, anyone won't cheer and cry at the same time.After 8 Oscar nominations, Page finally won. She died the following year, at age 64. Not fair.Not fair at all, to those who crave just a little more of her brilliance.F.

386571,AQE41QO3NEUMW,6303832601,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[3, 3]","Written for TV in 1953, this wonderful play by Horton Foote was revived for film in 1985 with Geraldine Page taking the role originated by Lillian Gish. All resemblance to that first production must have ended even before Page's first line, for she gives the role the stamp of her distinctive style - restless and mercurial, shifting through shades and nuance of emotion several times in a single line of dialogue - and often when it's somebody else's line. Understanding her role as that of a tough and difficult woman, not a sweet old lady, Page put a career's worth of stage and film experience into what turned out to be an Oscar-winning performance.After more than 20 years, however, what also emerges are the fine performances of the other actors in the film, particularly John Heard as her son and Rebecca Demornay as a traveling companion on the bus. Both bring a stillness to the scenes they share with Page, and when Heard finally lets us see some of the anguish inside his character, it tears your heart out. As Foote devotes his loving attention to the lives of ordinary people whose life crises are universal, we see ourselves in the struggles of a Texas family to deal with age, mortality, and the unfairness of life. The DVD includes interviews with several members of the cast, the director, producer, and others. Of particular interest are their recollections of what it was like to work with Page.",5,Oscar-winning performance . . .,1215993600,"07 14, 2008",2008,1415,"['Written', 'TV', '1953', 'wonderful', 'play', 'Horton', 'Foote', 'was', 'revived', 'film', '1985', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'taking', 'role', 'originated', 'Lillian', 'Gish', 'resemblance', 'first', 'production', 'must', 'have', 'ended', 'even', 'Page', 'first', 'line', 'role', 'stamp', 'distinctive', 'style', 'restless', 'mercurial', 'shifting', 'shades', 'nuance', 'emotion', 'several', 'times', 'single', 'line', 'dialogue', 'often', 'when', 'somebody', 'else', 'line', 'Understanding', 'role', 'tough', 'difficult', 'woman', 'not', 'sweet', 'old', 'lady', 'Page', 'put', 'career', 'worth', 'stage', 'film', 'experience', 'what', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance.After', 'more', '20', 'years', 'however', 'what', 'also', 'are', 'fine', 'performances', 'other', 'actors', 'film', 'particularly', 'John', 'Heard', 'son', 'Rebecca', 'Demornay', 'traveling', 'companion', 'bus', 'bring', 'stillness', 'scenes', 'share', 'Page', 'when', 'Heard', 'finally', 'see', 'anguish', 'character', 'heart', 'out', 'Foote', 'loving', 'attention', 'lives', 'ordinary', 'people', 'life', 'crises', 'are', 'universal', 'see', 'struggles', 'Texas', 'family', 'deal', 'age', 'mortality', 'unfairness', 'life', 'DVD', 'interviews', 'several', 'members', 'cast', 'director', 'producer', 'others', 'particular', 'interest', 'are', 'recollections', 'what', 'was', 'work', 'Page']",Trip to Bountiful VHS

Geraldine Page's character (Carrie Watts) is cooped up with her son and daughter-in-law in a small apartment.  Her constant hymn-humming drives the in-law nuts, while the latter's selfish, tyrannical demands make Page's life a cramped hell.  The in-law is more interested, it seems, in Watts's Social Security check than in her welfare, and takes every precaution to ensure that Watts never leaves the apartment alone.Watts is old now, and in her anguish wishes to visit her childhood home in Bountiful one last time.  She schemes to hide her check and light out for the bus station.  She's not gone long before her relatives are in hot pursuit.  She meets several characters along the way, including Rebecca de Mornay's sweet, pretty bus traveler.  You'll be hard pressed to not wipe away a tear when Watts reveals, ever so briefly and without histrionics, the unhappiness of her life and the man she loved.She finally makes it to the end of the bus line in the middle of the night, not far from Bountiful, but needs to somehow arrange a ride.  Unhappily in the morning the sheriff arrives to take her, and you can feel her claustrophobic frustration and sorrow to be denied her last dream.  The sheriff is a kindly man, though, and he is the one who takes her home, to the abandoned house sitting in the midst of trees and overgrown weeds and grass.  If you've ever visited the ruins of a place you once inhabited, or that of another family, you might be able to guess at the strength and type of emotions that surge through Watts.  Geraldine Page portrays all of this beyond acting, to the point where you think this homecoming is really happening.In this pretty little spot with the run-down house, the sheriff ruminates as to the people who lived in Bountiful, before cotton and carelessness used up the soil and everyone moved on.  The son and his wife arrive.  There is no soaring climax, no glorious finale, just life going on, which makes this movie so true to life.  Mother and son talk as the breeze rustles through the old house and the plants, and they return to the car.  There is an understated hope of greater understanding and reconciliation between the two women, just like you might think could happen in the real world.  The movie ends with Carrie Watts in the back seat of the car as it leaves Bountiful, with a beautiful rendition of the beautiful hymn ""Softly and Tenderly Jesus is Calling.""Such a moving and perfectly observed movie and ending.  When everything clicked, Hollywood could really do it right sometimes.
