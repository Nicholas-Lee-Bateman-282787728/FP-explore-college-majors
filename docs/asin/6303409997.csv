It says so on the cover,""If you loved Home Alone,you'll love Blank Check!"" ""Blank Check"" basically recycles some Home Alone tropes,with boring results. Brian Bonsall (who seems to have vanished--with good reason--after this movie) stars as Preston Waters,a boy whose parents belittle him because he,unlike his older brothers,doesn't own a business(??) The kid is only 10 or so--and his parents expect him to be Bill Gates?Preston finds a blank check,and smitten with a bank teller (Karen Duffy) Soon he has his own castle,there are ENDLESS montages of his wealthy lifestyle,and there are mobsters thrown in the mix. There are some incredible amounts of lameness.At a creepy point in ""Blank Check"",Preston asks the teller out on a date--and towards the end,she kisses him. On the lips. Preston gets her to promise to meet him in six years(!!!) Okay,he likes older women--but in a children's movie,do we need to know that? And isn't he a bit young to be interested in girls?

373220,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303409997,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","It may lack any and all realism, and yet there is a lot to adore about this comical kid's movie.  With a storyline that will have you glued to the screen, `Blank Check' has enough of the good to outweigh the absurdity of it all.The story tells the story of young Preston who, through a series of unfortunate (or should I say fortunate) events winds up with a blank check.  The man at the other end of that check is a gangster who just so happens to be handing out $1,000,000 to a man named Juice.  When Preston enters the bank with check in hand, he is mistaken for Juice and handed the million.  After that, Preston goes crazy, spending the money like water while the gangsters are trying desperately to find him and their cash.Big houses, fun gadgets and kids being kids litter the balance of the film, and the moral lesson of finding true friends and not just those who are chasing a dollar will help kids to realize that having things does not answer all of your problems.The acting is decent and the flow of the film is great.

373231,A25RN8X70DSZLU,6303409997,JRP,"[0, 0]","Hello & welcome to this, this review for part of my 20 years ago & 2004 in film series this review is for Blank Check a movie I haven't seen probably 14 or 15 years back in 1994 however I saw this movie in theaters twice the 2nd being in cheap dollar theater. Now this series of reviews does have movies that I saw & liked as a kid some of them don't hold up like last year I reviewed A Cop & Half & back in November I did a rant on Josh & Sam which to be honest I have never cared for. Black Check however does hold up for me cause it's fun & the moments that were suppose to be funny I laughed at for the most part. Anyway Blank Check had a budget of $13 million & it made $30 million in The US it was a hit. Directed by Rupert Wainwright he directed Stigmata which I haven't seen since I saw it in theaters back in 99 & never saw it again so no opinion on it & he directed the s  hit  t  y Fog remake. Now it's kind of depressing reading what happened to the cast like Brian Bonsall who played Preston has gotten in a lot of legal trouble & substance abuse problems. Karen Duffy who played Shay Stanley ended up getting Neurosarcoidsis which has left her partially paralyzed & Tone Loc who played Juice has had a series of fainting spells I don't know if it's drugs or it's bad health I hope either way I hope he gets better. The rest of the cast has James Rebhorn as Fred Waters he's had quite a few supporting character role. Miguel Ferrer as Carl Quigley other than his role in Robocop this is the only role I have seen him. Michael Lerner as Biderman & Rick Ducommun as Henry. The story is about this kid named Preston he has this Dad who is sort of uptight with money & has to put up with his Brother Ralph & Damien who have their own business as I said he has a Dad who is uptight with money & his Brothers stole his so he asks for money cause he's going to go to this Birthday Party for this rich kid his Dad gives him $6 & he tells him that he can have fun with it all day. He has a horrible day at this Water Park so back at home he asks for money for his Birthday his parents give a check his Grandma gave him for his Birthday but it's blank his Dad writes it for $11 so Preston tries to open up an account at The Bank. You're introduced to this lady named Shay Stanley who is working as a Bank Teller in reality she is an F B I she's a real likable character. She's undercover trying to catch this escaped Band Robber named Carl Quigley. Preston finds out he has to have $200 to open an account. Quigley comes to The Bank he meets up with this Banker he knows named Biderman he gives him The $1 million he will have a guy named Juice come by the next day & cash a check for it. That rich kid takes Preston's Check he chases after him he's nearly ran over by Quigley he gets out of his car he ran over Preston's Bike he's going to write him a check to buy a new 1 you have that rich kid negotiate  which was kind of funny & Cop Car passes through Preston is given a Blank Check by Quigley Preston makes it out with $1 million. The next day he goes to The Bank Biderman thinks he's Juice. Then you the introduction of Juice who is the funniest actor in this movie the actors name is Tone Loc who sang The WIld Thing which is really catchy tune. He's checking out all these young women & that's funny. He also runs into Preston he tells him to go on to school. In Biderman's Office Juice is there for the money Biderman tells him "" The Eagle has landed."" The Horse is in The Barn."" ""The Chicken is in the pot.' He tells him someone has already came for the money. Meanwhile using an Apple Macintosh with this voice program he buys this Mansion. I remember in Grade School that's all there was Macintosh's then it was all PC's in High School. From there he hires a Limo Driver named Henry who is a real likable character then he goes out & buys all this he buys some kind of Virtual Reality Game he buys an Arcade Cabinet of Punch Out. All kinds of clothes why I can relate with this movie as kid was cause of money to get toys & different things I couldn't afford. As an adult I can relate to because we all need money to live. Preston has to lie & lie about Mr Macintosh cause that's the name he gave when he bought The Mansion. Shay wants to meet Mr Macintosh & Preston tells her he will go out with her. You have Quigley along with Biderman & Juice at a Water Park looking for Preston & Quigley asks Juice if he sees him. Juice points out these kids & is like he looks like him, she looks like him. He tells him you expect me to find this kid with 1 picture this is crazy then he says I'm going to get on the waterslide. You have these 2 kids that are brothers the older asks where the refreshment stand is at Quigley takes his Cigar & pops the ballon of the Younger Brother. Preston goes out with Shay. Henry gives Preston some priceless advice that if they got to a Buffet line his pockets with plastic baggies & take some Chicken Wings home cause girls love cause it doesn't say all you can eat here does it? Preston takes Shay to this nice restaurant where Preston makes a fool of himself when he leans back in his chair & falls backwards in it & takes the table cloth & food with him. Then they go out for Burgers Preston shows Shay this cool water fountain which is a rememberable scene for me. Quigley & his group spot him they chase after Preston the water shoots up on the fountain & they slip & fall. Miguel Ferrer, Tone Loc & Michael Lerner were a lot fun to watch. Preston is going to have this Birthday Party for Mr Macintosh in reality it's his Birthday. Then you have this really annoying ladysetting up for the party. While he's at the park Preston is chased by Quigley & his goons. They chase after Preston in a car Preston goes down a hill on his bike. Quigley has Juice get out & chase him on foot. Preston dropped his backpack while being chased Juice ends up falling in pond. Preston gets his backpack but later on finds out he's lost a lot of money. Juice gets back to the car he looks like he's going to throw up Quigley tells him he better not throw up in his car he just had it detailed then Juice does it anyway. That rich boy from earlier finds $100 bill but Quigley & his goons take him & use him to find out where Preston is at & they use intimidation tactics like threatening to throw him off a building which is a big wtf isn't this a Disney Movie. Preston's Brother's tell him Shay is a gold digger Preston asks Henry what's that mean he tells him ""A fool & his gold is soon parted. Preston wants to know what that means Henry says ""It's an old saying. Like there's more than 1 way to skin a cat you hear that 1? Who Skins cats? Why would you skin a cat? & there's not more than 1 way to skin a cat there's only 1 way. You grab it & pull the skin off. What's the number 2 way you stick a hose up the cats but  t & he gets so bloated that he skins himself? Kill 2 birds 1 stone, You heard that? you know anyone who has killed 1 bird with 1 stone? Kids try it all the time. You cant actually hit a bird with a stone unless it's a giant 1 & little baby bird."" He tells him that he guesses that a fool & his gold soon parted means that once it's gone it's gone. He tells him that you're in Brokesville & then you find out who your real friends are. Shay hasn't showed up yet & he is told the expense for the party he checks the balance he finds out he has over a little over $300 left. You have Preston's Father come in & thinks he's talking to Mr Macintosh he tells him he wants Preston to come home early for his Birthday. I will admit this was a real touching scene. Preston goes outside but his Dad has drove off Henry has left & you have Shay ask him about Mr Macintosh. He tells her that he's gone he tells the annoying lady that he's left he tells the party goers to leave. Then Quigley & goons show up & he finds out that Preston spent all the money. Preston tells him Macintosh is a name he made up. While talking to his group they tell him that he can use the name Macintosh to create a new life. Preston runs off & uses all the gadgets & toys to hold them off. Like Biderman he puts this VR headset on him & freaks out which Michael Lerner's over acting makes this scene is fun. Then he sits in this chair Preston has it raised to the ceiling. Juice is outside he gets in the batting cage & Preston fires these Baseballs at Juice 1 of them hits him in the b  all  s. Then you have a really fun scene where Preston knocks Quigley into this Cage Ball he gets in a Go Cart & knocks him into the pool. Preston thinks he's killed him only for him to be taken by Quigley Then The F B I acts & Quigley takes the blame & is sent to jail along with Biderman & Juice. Preston talks to Shay they agree they'll talk in 5 or 6 years cause Shay likes Preston. Preston's Dad comes & gets him he sees Henry who went to get Ice Cream & they say their Good Byes When he gets home before he blows out his candles on his cake he looks at a picture of Shay. Final thoughts Blank Check is an awesome movie I can enjoy it now even so it's 1 of those movies that both kids & adults can enjoy. There's likable characters a plot that is both good & a lot of fun. The soundtrack & score are both very good. This is Rupert Wainwright's best film cause The Fog remake is  bad & I don't remember Stigmata at all cause I haven't seen it since I saw it in 99. Brian Bonsall did a great job. Miguel Ferrer was really good. Karen Duffy did a really good job. James Rebhorn did a great job. Michael Lerner was very good. Tone Loc did a very good job. Rick Ducommun was very good. So Blank Check I can recommend if you grew up with the movie like I did & haven't seen it in a long time. My next review will be for Reality Bites until then I hope you enjoyed my review for Blank Check.",5,20 years ago Blank Check 9/10,1392076800,"02 11, 2014",2014,9801,"['Hello', 'welcome', 'review',

373234,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,6303409997,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[12, 13]","There are several ways to watch this movie.  The easiest way is to watch the movie as a comedy about a wimpy kid that seems to have self-esteem issues.  However, if you look deeper, there are some interesting lessons regarding being yourself and loving your family, even when it seems like they do not love you.  Somewhere in all this there is another moral about a fool and his money parting in six days.Preston Waters (Brian Bonsall - the cute little kid in ""Family Ties"" who has now disappeared from acting) is the invisible kid in his family.  Preston seems to have difficulty catching a break.  He has to ride the awful rides at a theme park.  His brothers move their junk into his room because they are enterprising and are starting a business.  Preston is unable to start a checking account because he has less than the $200 minimum balance.  However, Preston meets beautiful Shay Stanley (Karen Duffy) while at the bank, little realizing that Shay had an itty bitty secret.Preston's life reaches a low point when a fellow named Quigley (Miguel Ferrer) runs over his bicycle and destroys it.  Quigley is writing a check when a police car shows up.  Since Quigley is on the run from the police, Quigley hands Preston a signed blank check to pay for the damaged bicycle and leaves as quickly as possible.Preston gets a very clever idea.  Preston wonders whether he might be able to write a check for a thousand...no, wait...a MILLION dollars.  I could tell that Preston did not actually think he would be able to get away with writing a check for a million dollars.  To Preston, and my, surprise, a shady bank executive named Biderman (Michael Lerner) honors the million dollar check, thinking that Quigley had sent Preston to pick the money up.Preston departs with his new fortune as Juice (Tone Loc) shows up, sent by Quigley to pick the money up.  Soon Quigley, Juice and Biderman are all searching for Preston.Preston quickly becomes accustomed to having a million dollars and spends the money quickly.  Preston acquires a house, lots of high tech toys, a chauffeur, and nice clothes.  Preston culminates his short career as a boy of wealth by throwing a birthday party for himself that quickly turns bittersweet, with emphasis on the bitter.Once you ignore the potential consequences, the movie suddenly becomes interesting and enjoyable.  I admit to occasionally wondering how Preston would get himself out of the hole that he insisted on digging for himself as he created the persona of Macintosh, who was busily breaking a number of laws.  Disney decides to keep the ending light and happy, and neglects the details as the bad guys get theirs and Preston learns a lesson about love and family and life in general.As the credits roll, focus on the fun aspects of this movie.  We know that it would be impossible to do what Preston did without going to jail, or serving some sort of sentence.  Quigley made the unfortunate mistake of being a criminal in a Disney movie, and criminals have never fared well in Disney movies.  In this movie, the criminal gets his just desserts as the essentially good kid walks back to his family and avoids responsibility as the funny bad guy Quigley walks back to prison, accepting all the responsibility.  Perhaps Preston might have learned more had he accepted responsibility for his mistakes, but we have always enjoyed lovable rogues, and Brian Bonsall was a cute underdog who we wanted to walk away from his mistakes without repercussions.  The clever and tidy ending allows Preston a happy ending, and lets you know that you have watched another nicely packaged Disney movie.

373241,A1C7BWPATO40VA,6303409997,Nathan T.,"[3, 16]","I watched this when I was little and I had very small bits of memories about it. So recently, I watched it again to relive some memories and I have to say that I was not happy. Have any of you guys ever watched a cartoon or movie as a youngster and tried watching it again only to realize you've ruined the fond memory you've had of it? Because now you see how bad it actually is?That's how I feel with this movie.Before I go on I would like to give a warning:POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT! PLEASE READ IF YOU DON'T CARE OR AFTER YOU'VE WATCHED THE MOVIE!1. First, I really thought the movie would have a reasonable, even moderately believable plot that assists the story to make it plausible to the viewers. However, it does NOT. This really ruined the movie for me. I can watch almost anything, kid movies, chick-flicks, anime, cartoons, serious adult movies, you name it. However, it must be somewhat believable and plausible. This movie is so unbelievably full of craaap that it just kills it. I'll list why:a) If a kid runs around flaunting that much money, he'd be caught immediately. He would be reported immediately either from a store owner or a random stranger. Anyone in their right mind would find it highly suspicious.b) The bad guys had a positive picture on the kid, all they needed was to post it around schools or parks. The kid can't live that far, he rides a bike. Just post it up that he stole something.c) The whole thing about the blank check is just too much to make it believable. It makes winning the lottery look like a joke. So all he had to do was get hit by that exact car, by that exact person, at the exact right time, come into the bank at the exact right time with the exact check with the full exact amount of money written on it and encounters a perfect situation to cash in that check and gets out at the exact right time. It's just too much. Forget the check kid, with your luck go buy a lottery ticket that's worth a lot more than that?d) How everyone remains clueless about Macintosh is....beyond me. How a kid fools everyone including the FBI....I have no clue on that.2. The father, I thought, in fact the whole family are a bunch of freaken JEEERKS. I hated the Dad a few minutes after seeing him. He is an extremely hate-able character. People like that should not have kids.3. Pedophile, ""cougar' FBI agent lady in the movie. THIS IS A PERSONAL SHOUT OUT AT THE REVIEWER THAT SAYS SHE IS A THIRD GRADE TEACHER. I'm completely disgusted, but not very surprised that you would let our kids watch this obviously ignorant and disgusting movie. Maybe this is why our kids have such low scores at school because they watch these moooronic movies that give nothing to the kids. If I was a parent, I'd be on the lookout for teachers that say this movie is great for their kids. This movie had a much older woman kissing a young child on the lips and telling him to call her back in a few years, a child that isn't even near his puberty yet. HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY SAY IT'S A GOOD KID'S MOVIE? DISGUSTING. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED AND FIRED.4. The kid was nervous about the whole thing and goes around sneaking the check of the million dollars. That means he know it was a bad thing to do and is probably somewhat aware that he was taking the money wrongfully, yet he does it. This is no joke. This is a movie about a THIEF, don't think it is funny because it is about a little kid. Just because it's a kid and it's made by Disney should not make it seem like some sort of joke. He is a THIEF and the movie is giving bad information to kids that watch it. It's nothing to laugh about.There's tons of other unbelievable elements in this story that just completely makes it craaap.I can watch a movie, but only movies that have a decent understandable story to it.Everyone that rated this above a 2 star, you know what, this is why our country is so messed up. This movie was not only outlandishly ridiculous to the point where it loses all credibility in it's plot, but it was not a very fun and entertaining movie to begin with. Don't waste your time with this garbage.I will never EVER recommend this movie to any child. They're already messed up as it is.",1,Rewatched After Years.

373246,AU1OTANVBW9GM,6303409997,Tyson Babbel,"[0, 0]","That's the review we see on the cover.  Yeah, I'm sure a lot of you notice the similarities between this film and Home Alone.  It's possible that the people who made this film got their ideas from Home Alone, as the first two were already out when this was made.  Some of the similarities include a reserved kid, who seems to prefer more time by himself, than with friends.  A kid who has a disagreement with his family, and explains how he wants his own house money, and ends up getting what every kid dreams $1 Million just as the kid in Home Alone got to stay Home Alone and got his own trip to NYC and hotel.  Another similarity with this film and Home Alone 2 is how Kevin calls a number to make a hotel reservation by slowing down his Talkboy recording, and the people listening believe that weird voice is a real voice, in this film Preston uses his computer voice and is able to buy a house from the people listening to that weird voice, lol!!  Also, like both Home Alones, it involves a kid who really thinks he'll enjoy all that money and what he dreams about getting.  At first he really does, but afterwards he wants to be around his own family and friends.  Of course, the main similarity is the slapstick humor with this film and Home Alone, as it shows the guys after the kid get taken down in funny ways.  One final similarity between this and Home Alone is we notice how Kevin's parents never know that he was targeted by burglars when they were gone.  It's the same thing with this film, except Preston's parents seem to know something happened but just aren't sure what happened.I actually really love this film, and prefer it over Home Alone.  I think it's a faster paced movie, and has more of a plot to it.  However, there are some unanswered questions that we all wonder about the film.  First off, in real life would Preston have gotten arrested?  Of course, this is a Disney movie and the main character is a kid and one we like.  They probably wouldn't want a kid's film to show a main character get arrested, but would he have?  Or what about what would happen next?  I mean, I'm sure they'd find out in court the guy who said he was Macintosh was actually Quigley, and those guys would talk about how Preston made up Macintosh and spent all that money, would the police track him down?  What would happen to all the things Preston bought?  Would Preston tell his parents the next day about who Macintosh really was as he said he'd tell his Dad, and would he get in trouble by his parents for it?  Final question, would Preston and Shay eventually get together as Preston wished?  Yeah, part of the movie involves a kid in-love with an older lady who was an FBI agent.  That might have been ok to include in a movie when the film was made 20 years ago, but I doubt they'd put that in a film nowadays.Anyways, thanks for reading this long review.  I wanted to share my own thoughts for this film.  In all, it's pretty entertaining, and it's a film that shows every kid's dream.  I would recommend it.",5,"""If You Loved Home Alone, You'll Love Blank Check.""",1389312000,"01 10, 2014",2014,3026,"['review', 'see', 'cover', 'Yeah', ""'m"", 'sure', 'lot', 'notice', 'similarities', 'film', 'Home', 'Alone', 'possible', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'film', 'got', 'ideas', 'Home', 'Alone', 'first', 'two', 'were', 'already', 'out', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'similarities', 'include', 'reserved', 'kid', 'who', 'prefer', 'more', 'time', 'friends', 'kid', 'who', 'disagreement', 'family', 'how', 'own', 'house', 'money', 'up', 'getting', 'what', 'kid', '1', 'Million', 'just', 'kid', 'Home', 'Alone', 'got', 'stay', 'Home', 'Alone', 'got', 'own', 'trip', 'NYC', 'hotel', 'similarity', 'film', 'Home', 'Alone', '2', 'how', 'Kevin', 'number', 'make', 'hotel', 'reservation', 'slowing', 'down', 'Talkboy', 'recording', 'people', 'listening', 'believe', 'weird', 'voice', 'real', 'voice', 'film', 'Preston', 'computer', 'voice', 'able', 'buy', 'house', 'people', 'listening', 'weird', 'voice', 'lol', 'Also', 'Home', 'Alones', 'kid', 'who', 'really', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'money', 'what', 'getting', 'first', 'really', 'afterwards', 'be', 'own', 'family', 'friends', 'course', 'main', 'similarity', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'film', 'Home', 'Alone', 'guys', 'kid', 'get', 'taken', 'down', 'funny', 'ways', 'One', 'final', 'similarity', 'Home', 'Alone', 'notice', 'how', 'Kevin', 'parents', 'never', 'know', 'was', 'targeted', 'burglars', 'when', 'were', 'gone', 'same', 'thing', 'film', 'Preston', 'parents', 'seem', 'know', 'something', 'happened', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'actually', 'really', 'love', 'film', 'prefer', 'Home', 'Alone', 'think', 'faster', 'paced', 'movie', 'more', 'plot', 'However', 'are', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'wonder', 'film', 'First', 'off', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'Preston', 'have', 'gotten', 'arrested', 'course', 'Disney', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'kid', 'one', 'like', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'kid', 'film', 'show', 'main', 'character', 'get', 'arrested', 'would', 'have', 'what', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'mean', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'d"", 'find', 'out', 'court', 'guy', 'who', 'said', 'was', 'Macintosh', 'was', 'actually', 'Quigley', 'guys', 'would', 'talk', 'how', 'Preston', 'made', 'up', 'Macintosh', 'spent', 'money', 'would', 'police', 'track', 'down', 'What', 'would', 'happen', 'things', 'Preston', 'bought', 'Would', 'Preston', 'tell', 'parents', 'next', 'day', 'who', 'Macintosh', 'really', 'was', 'said', ""'d"", 'tell', 'Dad', 'would', 'get', 'trouble', 'parents', 'Final', 'question', 'would', 'Preston', 'Shay', 'eventually', 'get', 'together', 'Preston', 'wished', 'Yeah', 'part', 'movie', 'kid', 'in-love', 'older', 'lady', 'who', 'was', 'FBI', 'agent', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'ok', 'include', 'movie', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'doubt', ""'d"", 'put', 'film', 'nowadays.Anyways', 'thanks', 'reading', 'long', 'review', 'wanted', 'share', 'own', 'thoughts', 'film', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'film', 'kid', 'dream', 'would', 'recommend']",N/A
