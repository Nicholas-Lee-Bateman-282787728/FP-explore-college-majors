You just know that whoever wrote this took a lot of something real life into it.It is, however, a very good movie albeit some may think depressing. Jeff Bridges plays a shrink dealing with his second marriage. His first marriage to Farrah Fawcett broke up, not because he didn't love her, but because she was too out of his league -- or so he thought. They were in love but she was a model and he was a shrink. And he would always worry that he wasn't enough for her. Broken up... but still in love. Love is all well and good but other factors can break apart a relationship and I think often do. Marriage number two seems to be a much better fit for him, Alice Krige, a pretty woman but, a concert cellist with two kids and baggage of her own from her husband #1's death.The plot of the movie involves mostly her kids crisis dealing with all the changes. Drew Barrymore was great. At the time she was in this movie I was her age. Here she plays extremely awkward and I remember exactly how she later blossomed in real life. Lucas Hass was also excellent as the younger more sensitive boy struggling more quietly to deal. Both get into trouble and the movie shows how it really is in life... it is always tough, there are always issues, people have baggage and yet, you can still have a family life that is rewarding if challenging.The movie isn't told in a linear way. There are flashbacks, flashforwards, and lots of talking... which makes it seem more like real life.I never think of this movie as a second time around film, but that is true, I think of it as a life film. Life is messy and it is nice to see that up on the screen sometime to assure you it isn't just you. There are lots of deep thoughts here and great performances by all. I especially loved Linda Lavin as Larry's wise friend who moves a lot of the deep thinking here.",4,Still think about this movie..,1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,1957,"['whomever', 'wrote', 'movie', 'want', 'know', '20', 'years', 'catching', 'cable', 'really', 'think', 'issues', 'just', 'know', 'whoever', 'wrote', 'took', 'lot', 'something', 'real', 'life', 'it.It', 'however', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'may', 'think', 'depressing', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'shrink', 'dealing', 'second', 'marriage', 'first', 'marriage', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'broke', 'up', 'not', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'was', 'too', 'league', 'so', 'thought', 'were', 'love', 'was', 'model', 'was', 'shrink', 'would', 'always', 'worry', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Broken', 'up', 'still', 'love', 'Love', 'well', 'good', 'other', 'factors', 'can', 'break', 'apart', 'relationship', 'think', 'often', 'do', 'Marriage', 'number', 'two', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'fit', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'pretty', 'woman', 'concert', 'cellist', 'two', 'kids', 'baggage', 'own', 'husband', '1', 'death.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'mostly', 'kids', 'crisis', 'dealing', 'changes', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'was', 'great', 'time', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'age', 'Here', 'extremely', 'awkward', 'remember', 'exactly', 'how', 'later', 'blossomed', 'real', 'life', 'Lucas', 'Hass', 'was', 'also', 'excellent', 'younger', 'more', 'sensitive', 'boy', 'struggling', 'more', 'quietly', 'deal', 'get', 'trouble', 'movie', 'how', 'really', 'life', 'always', 'tough', 'are', 'always', 'issues', 'people', 'have', 'baggage', 'yet', 'can', 'still', 'have', 'family', 'life', 'rewarding', 'challenging.The', 'movie', ""n't"", 'told', 'linear', 'way', 'are', 'flashbacks', 'flashforwards', 'lots', 'talking', 'seem', 'more', 'real', 'life.I', 'never', 'think', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'film', 'true', 'think', 'life', 'film', 'Life', 'messy', 'nice', 'see', 'up', 'screen', 'sometime', 'assure', ""n't"", 'just', 'are', 'lots', 'deep', 'thoughts', 'here', 'great', 'performances', 'especially', 'loved', 'Linda', 'Lavin', 'Larry', 'wise', 'friend', 'who', 'lot', 'deep', 'thinking', 'here']",See You in the Morning VHS

I liked this cute tale of seeing how one marriage ended in divorce, the other in a death and finally the challenge of two individuals coming together.See Jeff as the whacko psychiatrist who will do any outrageous thing to win his girl. Witness him as he deals with his feelings of loss and his inept attempts at trying to fit in with his new wife and step-children.Alice does a fair portrayal as an obsessive mom. there are a few moments of zaniness snf light humor but for the most part you will ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!

256215,A7TRK2GG6BHWD,6301572793,"Johnny Pasta ""Johnny Pasta""","[4, 4]",Is there anything that Jeff Bridges can't do? He is such a diverse actor it isn't even funny. And this was one of his classic examples of what he can do. Good story line of two separate families with their own classic issues to deal with. Jeff sort of jumps out of the kettle and into the frying pan in this one and is torn between his first marriage/wife who is played by the late Farrah Fawcett and his second marriage/wife who is played by the beautiful English actress Alice Krige. He has a lot of baggage he has to sort out if his second marriage is going to be successful or not. But this movie is definitely worth the watch and maybe even a 2nd time too. I feel there are really no dull moments in it. Great supporting cast and very well written as far as diologue is concerned. If I could give this movie 6 stars I certainly would. I highly recommend this movie to anyone.,5,Is There Anything That Jeff Bridges Can't Do?,1330128000,"02 25, 2012",2012,880,"['anything', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'such', 'diverse', 'actor', ""n't"", 'even', 'funny', 'was', 'one', 'classic', 'examples', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'Good', 'story', 'line', 'two', 'separate', 'families', 'own', 'classic', 'issues', 'deal', 'Jeff', 'sort', 'jumps', 'kettle', 'frying', 'pan', 'one', 'torn', 'first', 'marriage/wife', 'who', 'played', 'late', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'second', 'marriage/wife', 'who', 'played', 'beautiful', 'English', 'actress', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'lot', 'baggage', 'sort', 'out', 'second', 'marriage', 'going', 'be', 'successful', 'not', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watch', 'maybe', 'even', '2nd', 'time', 'too', 'feel', 'are', 'really', 'dull', 'moments', 'Great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'as', 'far', 'diologue', 'concerned', 'could', 'give', 'movie', '6', 'stars', 'certainly', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone']",See You in the Morning VHS
256216,A3OL1AX1IODBYL,6301572793,"Laurel-Rain Snow &#34;Rain&#34; ""Rainy Days""","[2, 3]","I thought about this movie,See You in the Morning [VHS], one night while watching something about Farrah Fawcett on TV.  Typically, a flash of the film crosses my memory - and then I Google to find out which movie it was - followed by the old click of the Amazon pages.And voila!  I had this old flick - from way back when - with another favorite star, Jeff Bridges.  There was no DVD version, but I decided to take a chance on the VHS.As I watched the movie over again, I was reminded of why I enjoyed it so much back when.  Now it isn't one of those truly amazing flicks...but it is a ""feel-good"" tale of families - families that come together and then are torn apart - and the forces that connect and separate them.Newly widowed and newly divorced individuals, portrayed by Alice Krige and Jeff Bridges, chart their course through their budding relationship, which leads to marriage too quickly - you see the red flags going up all over the place! - but they are lonely.  And they love each other.  Their blended families bring a host of problems, the least of which is a shoplifting teen daughter and a son who runs away when he learns that his mother and new stepfather have put the home on the market.  This is his father's house!  He protests and creates trouble, but eventually everything is sorted out.Farrah Fawcett plays a beautiful, seductive ex-wife who makes a play for her ex-husband (Jeff Bridges' character) during her mother's final illness - when everyone is gathered together for a mournful goodbye.Will the characters finally solve their issues, or will the past eventually eclipse the newly developing connections?The movie was a little choppy in places, going back and forth too abruptly at times...but all in all, the images conveyed the angst of families in crisis and in flux.

The worst of them was Blake Edward's &quot;That's Life&quot;, but this one is a close second. Poor Jeff Bridges' marriage to gorgeous Farrah Fawcett breaks up. He then marries the luminous Alice Krige. He still isn't quite happy. Really, there should be a telethon!It's not that the movie is bad: all of the main actors are great, and the plot isn't that bad. Even the actors who play the kids (Drew Barrymore, Lucas Haas, Mackauley Culkin) manage not to be moppets. But somehow I just couldn't seem to care that much.
