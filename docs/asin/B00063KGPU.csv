Basically PD-1 combines the story lines of PRETTY WOMAN & LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY. Despite the fact the story was not original the film was very good. I took my daughter to see PD-1 back in 2001 and have seen it several times since then on DVD. When PD-2 came out I suggested to my 10 year old daughter that she and I go and check it out.We saw it this past weekend and it turned out to be even better than PD-1. The story picks up in Genovia. The Queen, portrayed by Julie Andrews, is about to step down as Queen so that Princess Mia can assume the role. However, a challenger to the throne surfaces. He is the nephew of one of the legislative members of Genovia. John Rhys-Davies portrays the scheming Uncle who covets the throne. Hector Elizondo returns in his role as Joe, the head of security for the Queen. In order for Princess Mia to assume the throne she will have to find and marry her husband within 30 days. To sum it up. Princess Mia, has to find a husband and avoid the pitfalls that the other heir to the throne is setting up for her. She has to do all this under intense media scrutiny.I really enjoyed this movie. It reminded me of the family movies Disney used to make back in the 1970's. Good clean fun for the whole family. There were a lot of noticeable supporting actors. Actors like Tom Poston, Larry Miller and Raven. I would have given this movie 5 out of 5 stars but I think the writers should have let Julie Andrews sing a song of her own rather than turning it into a duet with Raven. I'm sure kids, like my daughter, appreciated the addition of Raven but as an adult I felt it was hokey. So I give the film 4 out of 5 stars.It's so nice to have a little girl to view movies like this with. If I didn't have one my macho male ego would have probably kept me from ever watching these films on my own.  I'm sure that this DVD will join our collection when it becomes available.",4,A guilty pleasure of mine!,1094515200,"09 7, 2004",2004,1988,"['indicated', 'review', 'PD-1', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'Basically', 'PD-1', 'story', 'lines', 'PRETTY', 'WOMAN', 'LITTLE', 'LORD', 'FAUNTLEROY', 'fact', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'took', 'daughter', 'see', 'PD-1', 'back', '2001', 'have', 'seen', 'several', 'times', 'then', 'DVD', 'When', 'PD-2', 'came', 'out', 'suggested', '10', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'go', 'check', 'saw', 'past', 'weekend', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'even', 'better', 'PD-1', 'story', 'up', 'Genovia', 'Queen', 'portrayed', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'step', 'down', 'as', 'Queen', 'Princess', 'Mia', 'can', 'assume', 'role', 'However', 'challenger', 'throne', 'surfaces', 'nephew', 'one', 'legislative', 'members', 'Genovia', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies', 'scheming', 'Uncle', 'who', 'throne', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'returns', 'role', 'Joe', 'head', 'security', 'Queen', 'order', 'Princess', 'Mia', 'assume', 'throne', 'will', 'have', 'find', 'marry', 'husband', '30', 'days', 'sum', 'up', 'Princess', 'Mia', 'find', 'husband', 'avoid', 'pitfalls', 'other', 'heir', 'throne', 'setting', 'up', 'do', 'intense', 'media', 'scrutiny.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'reminded', 'family', 'movies', 'Disney', 'used', 'make', 'back', '1970', 'Good', 'clean', 'fun', 'whole', 'family', 'were', 'lot', 'noticeable', 'supporting', 'actors', 'Actors', 'Tom', 'Poston', 'Larry', 'Miller', 'Raven', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'movie', '5', '5', 'stars', 'think', 'writers', 'should', 'have', 'let', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'sing', 'song', 'own', 'rather', 'turning', 'duet', 'Raven', ""'m"", 'sure', 'kids', 'daughter', 'appreciated', 'addition', 'Raven', 'adult', 'felt', 'was', 'hokey', 'So', 'give', 'film', '4', '5', 'stars.It', 'so', 'nice', 'have', 'little', 'girl', 'view', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'macho', 'male', 'ego', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'kept', 'ever', 'watching', 'films', 'own', ""'m"", 'sure', 'DVD', 'will', 'join', 'collection', 'when', 'available']",N/A

857842,AOEFE93XSDHRM,B00063KGPU,Alicia Zieman,"[0, 3]","First of all, I highly RECOMMENDED!! I love The Princess Diaries books, I even have two of my books autographed by the author, Meg Cabot. If you love the books, you know this movie, has nothing to any of the books written so far. For one thing, in the books, Princess Mia is just starting her 2nd year of high school. This starts with, Princess Mia (Hatheway) graduating from college. She is goes back to Genovia, because she is going to taken over the position of Queen of Genovia, from her grandmother, Queen Clarisse (Andrews). But it is not as great as that. Mia finds out, while she is exploring the castle, that she is not the only heir. The other heir is Nicholas Devereaux (Chris Pine). His uncle, Vicount Mabrey, is the only who who wants Nicholas to be King. But in Genovia, their is a law that a woman has to be married, before she takes the throne. So they want to give Mia a year to get married. But because there are two heirs, Mia has to marry in 30 days, or forefit her crown. So her grandmother and her advisors give of her a slide show of her choices. They include Prince William, just because the love to look at him. From these coices, Mia epicks a guy who is in a English photographer. He is a desent guy, who's sweet and charming. (For those of you, who have seen Dead Like Me. He plays Mason on that show.) In the first 30 minutes of this movie you can guess what will happen. He proposes to Mia, but giving her a film canster with ring, that is a family heir-loom. For her enganment party, she has a slumber party, and she invites all princesses. At the party, they have matress surfing, even Queen Clarisse joins in. Then Queen Clarisse sings, (with help from Raven), at the party. That in my opinion was the best party of the movie. Those of you, who are not a Julie Andrew fans, she has not sung for a while because of a operation, she had that damaged her voice. Also people might remember her from Mary Pophins, Victor/Victoria, The Princess Diaries (#1), etc.",5,The Princess is Back and Better Than Ever,1095292800,"09 16, 2004",2004,1989,"['First', 'highly', 'RECOMMENDED', 'love', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'books', 'even', 'have', 'two', 'books', 'autographed', 'author', 'Meg', 'Cabot', 'love', 'books', 'know', 'movie', 'nothing', 'books', 'written', 'so', 'far', 'one', 'thing', 'books', 'Princess', 'Mia', 'just', 'starting', '2nd', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'Princess', 'Mia', 'Hatheway', 'graduating', 'college', 'back', 'Genovia', 'going', 'taken', 'over', 'position', 'Queen', 'Genovia', 'grandmother', 'Queen', 'Clarisse', 'Andrews', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'Mia', 'out', 'exploring', 'castle', 'not', 'only', 'heir', 'other', 'heir', 'Nicholas', 'Devereaux', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'uncle', 'Vicount', 'Mabrey', 'only', 'who', 'who', 'Nicholas', 'be', 'King', 'Genovia', 'law', 'woman', 'be', 'married', 'throne', 'want', 'give', 'Mia', 'year', 'get', 'married', 'are', 'two', 'heirs', 'Mia', 'marry', '30', 'days', 'forefit', 'crown', 'grandmother', 'advisors', 'give', 'slide', 'show', 'choices', 'include', 'Prince', 'William', 'just', 'love', 'look', 'coices', 'Mia', 'guy', 'who', 'English', 'photographer', 'desent', 'guy', 'who', 'sweet', 'charming', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'Dead', 'Me', 'Mason', 'show', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'movie', 'can', 'guess', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'Mia', 'giving', 'film', 'canster', 'ring', 'family', 'heir-loom', 'enganment', 'party', 'slumber', 'party', 'princesses', 'party', 'have', 'matress', 'surfing', 'even', 'Queen', 'Clarisse', 'Then', 'Queen', 'Clarisse', 'sings', 'help', 'Raven', 'party', 'opinion', 'was', 'best', 'party', 'movie', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'Julie', 'Andrew', 'fans', 'not', 'sung', 'while', 'operation', 'had', 'damaged', 'voice', 'Also', 'people', 'might', 'remember', 'Mary', 'Pophins', 'Victor/Victoria', 'Princess', 'Diaries', '1', 'etc']",N/A

857850,A337N68GI0AMA6,B00063KGPU,Amazon Girl,"[1, 2]","The sequel to The Princess Diaries begins with Princess Mia graduating college and moving back to Genovia, where she must prepare to become queen. However, as Mia soon finds out, an old Genovian law states that a queen must be married to assume the throne. Mia, not being married, is given a short period of time to find a husband and get married, or else she must forfeit the throne to Lord Nicholas, the next in line. Mia, not wanting to give up her dream of becoming queen, agrees to an arranged marriage with an Englishman, Andrew Jacoby. Although Andrew is nice enough, Mia just isn't in love with him. Problems arise when Mia begins to fall in love with Nicholas, whose uncle is set on having him become king (and NOT by marrying a queen).This movie was very enjoyable, and had a natural sweetness to it that I liked. However, the movie had its flaws. For humor, the script seemed to fall back on jokes from the first movie, which, though not too bad, were not quite as funny the second time around. Fans of the first movie might be disappointed that Mia's first love interest, Michael, is not in the second movie. Also, some aspects of the movie, like Mia's singing and dancing maids and the all-princess slumber party, seemed to try too hard to be pre-teen pleasers. The character played by Raven-Symone didn't really add much to the story, and the addition of Raven to the movie felt a little too much like Disney's attempt to make the movie cooler in the eyes of pre-teen girls. However, the story is genuine and fun, and has an ending that will leave viewers happy. A strength of the movie is the sweet relationships between characters (Mia and Andrew, Mia and Nicholas, Lilly and the Genovian Royal Guard member, and my personal favorite, Queen Clarisse and Joe) Fans of Julie Andrews will also be pleased to see her singing again, even if it is a duet with Raven.",4,"A sweet movie, not perfect, but still fun",1111968000,"03 28, 2005",2005,1876,"['sequel', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'Princess', 'Mia', 'graduating', 'college', 'moving', 'back', 'Genovia', 'where', 'must', 'prepare', 'become', 'queen', 'However', 'Mia', 'soon', 'out', 'old', 'Genovian', 'law', 'states', 'queen', 'must', 'be', 'married', 'assume', 'throne', 'Mia', 'not', 'being', 'married', 'given', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'find', 'husband', 'get', 'married', 'else', 'must', 'forfeit', 'throne', 'Lord', 'Nicholas', 'next', 'line', 'Mia', 'not', 'wanting', 'give', 'up', 'dream', 'becoming', 'queen', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'Englishman', 'Andrew', 'Jacoby', 'Andrew', 'nice', 'enough', 'Mia', 'just', ""n't"", 'love', 'Problems', 'arise', 'when', 'Mia', 'fall', 'love', 'Nicholas', 'uncle', 'set', 'having', 'become', 'king', 'NOT', 'marrying', 'queen', '.This', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'had', 'natural', 'sweetness', 'liked', 'However', 'movie', 'had', 'flaws', 'humor', 'script', 'seemed', 'fall', 'back', 'jokes', 'first', 'movie', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'were', 'not', 'quite', 'funny', 'second', 'time', 'Fans', 'first', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Mia', 'first', 'love', 'interest', 'Michael', 'not', 'second', 'movie', 'Also', 'aspects', 'movie', 'Mia', 'singing', 'dancing', 'maids', 'all-princess', 'slumber', 'party', 'seemed', 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'pre-teen', 'pleasers', 'character', 'played', 'Raven-Symone', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'much', 'story', 'addition', 'Raven', 'movie', 'felt', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'Disney', 'attempt', 'make', 'movie', 'cooler', 'eyes', 'pre-teen', 'girls', 'However', 'story', 'genuine', 'fun', 'ending', 'will', 'leave', 'viewers', 'happy', 'strength', 'movie', 'sweet', 'relationships', 'characters', 'Mia', 'Andrew', 'Mia', 'Nicholas', 'Lilly', 'Genovian', 'Royal', 'Guard', 'member', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Queen', 'Clarisse', 'Joe', 'Fans', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'pleased', 'see', 'singing', 'again', 'even', 'duet', 'Raven']",N/A

In it, we learned that the clumsy, awkward American teenager Mia Thermopolis was none other than the long lost princess of a tiny European country called Genovia.Flash-forward several years and the transformed Mia, now turning 21, is due to assume the crown from her grandmother, the reigning queen. One hitch: The scheming Count Mabrey wants his nephew to become king and for the royal line to pass to his own family. Thus, he prods the Genovian Parliament to observe an ancient law that requires the queen to be married.In other words, if Mia doesn't marry in 30 days, she won't become queen. To make matters worse, Mabrey's nephew, Sir Nicholas, is the cute guy she was crushing on at the royal ball. Now, he's trying to steal her crown.With the help of Mia's high school friend, Lilly, and a couple of silly servant girls, the queen fires up a hunt for a suitable king for Mia, landing on the near-perfect English Duke Andrew. But will Mia be able to go through with an arranged marriage? And will she be able to win over the people of Genovia in spite of her brash American ways?

The film also has a very good message about women being strong leaders and believing in themselves- the standard feel-good Disney fluff. The soundtrack is awesome too.

Would it hold the same charm as the first movie? And while the plot is certainly not like the books, would it contain the same sweetness and wit as the books, as did the first film? The second time around, The Princess Diaires is just as pleasing and a complete joy to watch.Princess Mia (Hatheway) has just graduated college. She is soon going to take over as Queen of Genovia from her grandmother, Queen Clarisse (Andrews). However, Mia learns that she must marry in 30 days or forfeit the crown of Genovia to another rightful heir, Nicholas Devereaux (played by, please excuse me for this, the total hottie Chris Pine). His uncle, Vicount Mabrey is really the one who wants Nicholas to be King, but Nicholas goes along with the scheme nonetheless. So Mia picks a decent guy who's sweet and charming and likeable, but can she go through with this wedding? Check out the movie for yourself to find out... though it's fairly obvious what will happen about fifteen minutes into the film, but who cares, it's great anyway.Anne Hatheway is such a delight on screen, carrying an aura of likeability. Julie Andrews is, of course, wonderful as well and completely believable as a Queen, as she is in the first film. And as I've already said, Chris Pine who plays Nicholas is absolutely gorgeous, completely sending me head over heels, and while I like to have composure about this kind of thing that doesn't matter in a movie at all (ah-hem-- how hot a guy is), I just can't help myself.Fans, definitely check this one out, you won't be disappointed.

Vegan,"[3, 3]","I realize that others may think this is just a fluffy little Disney sequel, but I thought The Princess Diaries 2 was a beautiful film and a sequel worthy of the acclaim of the first movie. Anne Hathaway returned to the big screen as the witty, beautiful, albeit klutzy Mia Thermopolis. Her performance never faltered, and I was very glad she was able to return to the role. Julie Andrews is an everlasting beauty, a royal gem of the film industry, and I was pleased to hear her lovely singing voice that surprised so many in this film. Callum Blue and Chris Pine were both breaths of fresh air, and their roles in this film, I'm sure, sent many girls' hearts aflutter. Their futures in movie-making are sure to be bright after their tender, heartwarming roles as competing suitors for Princess Mia's affections. The wardrobe and sets in this film were eye-catching and lavish, drawing the viewers in to the cozy little village feel of Genovia. I applaud Disney on their successful efforts in another wonderful film, and hope many people see this film and appreciate it as I do. To me, it was a great sequel to a great movie, and all of the cast and crew should be very proud.Anne Hathaway is a beautiful, talented actress, who thankfully hasn't fallen prey to the emaciated lifestyle of so many other actresses.

Disney makes this painstakingly clear when it begins to drift away from the more original and sarcastically humurous book version of ""The Princess Diaries"" by Meg Cabot (which I highly, highly recommened! And targeted to the mature too!)If I could ask one question to Disney, it'd be this: why? Why did you have the ruin a wonderful series and break away from the original mold of it? What happened to the delightful first Princess Diaries? Why do you have to make me feel so stupid when I'm watching it?I saw this move in theaters and predictably, was surrounded by hundreds of little girls ranging from seven to thirteen. Not the greatest date movie but I can safely say that this movie is a sure-fire date ruiner for all of those who had plans on seeing it. I could tell Disney got what it wanted: making little's girls fantasies about becoming a secret princess come true (or at least on the big screen)! From start to finish I found myself wondering ""why?"" and feeling stupider by the minute, crouching down lower and lower into my seat.Julie Andrews didn't help one bit either. This was the kind of movie that didn't require a sequel; hello, Disney! Get this: we weren't asking for one! Sadly, Julie Andrews drifted away from her more ""sophisticated"" roles the moment she started singing with one of Disney's tv show stars, a scene in which I found myself feeling like a complete idiot. This was the moment in the movie when I just wished I wouldn't be caught seeing it by my friends.The movie does have it's moments. It's cute at times (nothing significant enough for me to remember right now though) but a little too cute. Mia's lady's in waiting become very old very fast (when will they stop??). Personally (and I think many other people my own age will agree) it's not funny to watch two annoying and bouncy girls constantly repeat the same action over and over and over again. And no, the movie does not raise some strange longing to go bed sliding down stairs just in case you were wondering Disney. RE just made me want to smack the screen writers in the face and scream ""WHY!"" and ""Thanks for making me feel stupid!""Don't watch this movie unless you seriously hated the first and wanted a reason to laugh at it. Do watch it if you want to ruin your perception of the first. This is just one of those sad attempts Disney did in order to lure in it's less-mature girl audience for a couple of bucks and sadly, it worked. For instance if you want to feel like you're really stupid by all means watch this movie!

But no sooner has she moved into the Royal Palace with her beautiful, wise grandmother Queen Clarisse (Andrews) than she learns her days as a princess are numbered - Mia's got to lose the tiara and immediately take the crown herself. As if getting ready to rule wasn't enough, the stakes for Mia have never been higher - with Genovian law stating that princesses must be married before being crowne, Mia's in for a parade of suitors who'd all like to be her king. The cast and filmmakers behind the first film, including director Garry Marshall (""Pretty Woman,"" ""Runaway Bride""), return.This is a very charming follow up to the first film which has now become a classic. The cast is in fine shape and though the sequel is at times silly, like when Mia has a slumber party complete with the extremely mind-numbing mattress sufing. But the beginning and end are fun and the overall result is a cute and entertaining film.What Worked?Well just like the first movie the cast is amazing. Anne Hathaway (""Ella Enchanted"", ""The Other Side of Heaven"") is very aborable and extremely charming. Her combination of Sandra Bullock like wit and physical comedy plus the charm and goofiness of Reese Witherspoon make her the centerpiece of the film. Julie Andrews is amazing as the Queen.

I actually disliked the first film, and had no intention of seeing the sequel. But my aunt was insistent, so I reluctantly went. And was surprised. Pleasantly.Picking up where the first film left off, ""Diaries 2"" finds the Princess Mia (played by the charming Anne Hathaway) heading off to the fictional Genovia to take her place as the future queen. There's a snag, though: Genovia has a second candidate for the crown, one Lord Nicholas (Chris Vine) and he wants to be King. The only solution is for Princess Mia to find a husband in thirty days so that she does not rule alone, as dictated by Genovian law. We are thus treated to a montage of various suitors and potential husbands (including a shot of Prince William, who although ineligible is included because he's ""just nice to look at."") Mia gets ready for the arranged marriage while fending off Lord Nicholas, who everyone knows is evil and just out to get her throne. Or is he?Most other reviewers have singled out Chris Vine, who plays Nicholas, as a ""hottie"", ""cutie"", etc. This is incorrect. He is not cute. He is gorgeous. The casting agent must have found him in heaven. Vine and Hathaway have terrific chemistry, and together they save the movie. Everything to do with the two of them is great, especially the littler touches, such as when the Queen, again played by Julie Andrews, is trying to talk to Nicholas and he's busy making a chocolate souffl&eacute; in the background. Besides being stunning, Nicholas also rides, shoots arrows, reads incessantly (he's carrying a book in almost every shot) and apparently is a gourmet chef as well. Sign me up!I also loved Mia's two little maids (and their tap routine) and Hector Elizondo, reprising the role of the bodyguard Joe. There's flaws, to be sure, mostly with Gary Marshall's directing, which is a at best lazy and sometimes downright sloppy (including the inept crowd scenes which consist of the world's least-realistic peasants cheering halfheartedly). There's plenty to love though, so go see  it if you liked the original, are a fan of Hathaway, or enjoy staring at jaw-droppingly beautiful guys. You won't be disappointed.GRADE: B",4,"""We have a chicken situation in the throne room!""",1094169600,"09 3, 2004",2004,2254,"['aunt', 'called', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'demanding', 'drop', 'everything', 'see', 'Princess', '2', 'actually', 'disliked', 'first', 'film', 'had', 'intention', 'seeing', 'sequel', 'aunt', 'was', 'insistent', 'reluctantly', 'went', 'was', 'surprised', 'Pleasantly.Picking', 'up', 'where', 'first', 'film', 'left', 'off', '2', 'Princess', 'Mia', 'played', 'charming', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'heading', 'off', 'fictional', 'Genovia', 'take', 'place', 'future', 'queen', 'snag', 'Genovia', 'second', 'candidate', 'crown', 'one', 'Lord', 'Nicholas', 'Chris', 'Vine', 'be', 'King', 'only', 'solution', 'Princess', 'Mia', 'find', 'husband', 'thirty', 'days', 'so', 'not', 'rule', 'alone', 'dictated', 'Genovian', 'law', 'are', 'thus', 'treated', 'montage', 'various', 'suitors', 'potential', 'husbands', 'including', 'shot', 'Prince', 'William', 'who', 'ineligible', 'included', 'just', 'nice', 'look', 'Mia', 'ready', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'fending', 'off', 'Lord', 'Nicholas', 'who', 'everyone', 'evil', 'just', 'out', 'get', 'throne', 'Most', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'singled', 'out', 'Chris', 'Vine', 'who', 'Nicholas', 'hottie', 'cutie', 'etc', 'incorrect', 'not', 'cute', 'gorgeous', 'casting', 'agent', 'must', 'have', 'found', 'heaven', 'Vine', 'Hathaway', 'have', 'terrific', 'chemistry', 'together', 'save', 'movie', 'Everything', 'do', 'two', 'great', 'especially', 'littler', 'touches', 'such', 'when', 'Queen', 'again', 'played', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'trying', 'talk', 'Nicholas', 'busy', 'making', 'chocolate', 'souffl', 'eacute', 'background', 'being', 'stunning', 'Nicholas', 'also', 'shoots', 'arrows', 'reads', 'incessantly', 'carrying', 'book', 'almost', 'shot', 'apparently', 'gourmet', 'chef', 'as', 'well', 'Sign', 'also', 'loved', 'Mia', 'two', 'little', 'maids', 'tap', 'routine', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'reprising', 'role', 'bodyguard', 'Joe', 'flaws', 'be', 'sure', 'mostly', 'Gary', 'Marshall', 'directing', 'best', 'lazy', 'sometimes', 'downright', 'sloppy', 'including', 'inept', 'crowd', 'scenes', 'consist', 'world', 'least-realistic', 'peasants', 'cheering', 'halfheartedly', 'plenty', 'love', 'though', 'so', 'go', 'see', 'liked', 'original', 'are', 'fan', 'Hathaway', 'enjoy', 'staring', 'jaw-droppingly', 'beautiful', 'guys', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.GRADE', 'B']",N/A

Her preparations, however, hit a snag when it is discovered that she must marry in 30 days or forfeit the crown to Nicholas Deveraux (a handsome Chris Pine). Mia now struggles to complete her training to become Queen (she's still a bit of a klutz), as well as look for a husband, while Nicholas's uncle, Viscount Mabrey (an appropriately evil Jonathan Rhys-Davies) does everything he can to sabotage Mia so Nicholas will inherit the crown. Mia soon becomes engaged to Andrew Jacoby (a bland Callum Blue) but she finds herself attracted to Nicholas and has to decide whether she will sacrifice love to become Queen.Young girls (the target audience) who loved the first movie will also love this one. They'll laugh over Mia's clumsiness, drool over Nicholas, think the slumber party is lots of fun, laugh at the antics of the dog and cat, giggle at Mia's ladies maids, and sigh over the romance between Mia and Nicholas. As an adult who usually likes these kind of movies and who enjoyed the first movie, I thought the movie tried way too hard.  A little of Mia's clumsiness goes a long way (how many times did we really need to see Mia learning to shoot a bow and arrow, destroying things along the way?). A scene in which Mia stopped a parade to let orphans join in fell flat. The slumber party scene went on far too long, although it was a joy to hear Julie Andrews sing again. But even that scene was partially ruined by having Raven (who appears to be thrown into the movie only because she has a show on the Disney Channel) join in the song. Anne Hathaway showed that she could sing in ""Ella Enchanted"" and it would have made more sense for her to sing the duet with Andrews. Anyone who has seen these types of movies could see the ""twist"" that takes place at the wedding coming a mile away. Finally, a scene in which Mia and Nicholas spend the night together (dismissed with a single line saying ""nothing happened"") seemed inappropriate, although children probably won't get the implications.This isn't a terrible movie, just not a great one.

857877,A3H82LUT1EC655,B00063KGPU,Erika Sorocco,"[5, 6]","Twenty-one-year-old Princess Amelia Mignonette Thermopolis Renaldi (Anne Hathaway), of Mia, as she likes to be called, has just graduated from Princeton, and is heading back to her lovely castle located in Genovia, where her Grandmere (Julie Andrews), is getting ready to retire from the throne, and pass the torch onto Mia. Mia is excited at the notion of becoming Queen of Genovia within the next year, but there's something holding her back. A rule that has never been enforced in the history of Genovia. Mia must marry someone within the next 30 days. Which isn't as easy as it seems, given the fact that Mia wants true love, not an arranged marriage. So, the dating process begins. Mia is quickly proposed to by Andrew Jacoby (Callum Blue), and she accepts. However, there's no spark. The real person she's interested in, as much as she tries to deny it, is Nicholas Devereaux (Chris Pine). Unfortunately, his Uncle, Viscount Mabrey (John Rhys-Davies), is trying to push Mia out of line for the throne, and get Nicholas crowned King, and with the way things are going, he just may be able to accomplish his wicked plan.I have been a fan of Meg Cabot's PRINCESS DIARIES book series for years, and was ecstatic to find that THE PRINCESS DIARIES 2 was being released. Anne Hathaway (ELLA ENCHANTED and NICHOLAS NICKLEBY) once again shines in her role as the clumsy, yet lovable, Princess Mia. Her big eyes, and bright smile light up the screen in every scene she appears in. While Julie Andrews (ELOISE AT THE PLAZA and THE SOUND OF MUSIC) returns as the sometimes-strict, but incredibly fun Grandmere. With appearances by Heather Matarazzo (WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE and THE PRINCESS DIARIES) and Raven (THAT'S SO RAVEN and DR. DOLITTLE), as well as many other marvelous supporting characters who truly bring the movie to life, THE PRINCESS DIARIES 2 truly proves that miracles do happen.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper",5,A Royal Treat to Be Loved By All,1105056000,"01 7, 2005",2005,1958,"['Twenty-one-year-old', 'Princess', 'Amelia', 'Mignonette', 'Thermopolis', 'Renaldi', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Mia', 'be', 'called', 'just', 'graduated', 'Princeton', 'heading', 'back', 'lovely', 'castle', 'located', 'Genovia', 'where', 'Grandmere', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'getting', 'ready', 'retire', 'throne', 'pass', 'torch', 'Mia', 'Mia', 'excited', 'notion', 'becoming', 'Queen', 'Genovia', 'next', 'year', 'something', 'holding', 'back', 'rule', 'never', 'been', 'enforced', 'history', 'Genovia', 'Mia', 'must', 'marry', 'someone', 'next', '30', 'days', 'Which', ""n't"", 'as', 'easy', 'given', 'fact', 'Mia', 'true', 'love', 'not', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'So', 'dating', 'process', 'begins', 'Mia', 'quickly', 'proposed', 'Andrew', 'Jacoby', 'Callum', 'Blue', 'However', 'spark', 'real', 'person', 'interested', 'as', 'much', 'deny', 'Nicholas', 'Devereaux', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'Unfortunately', 'Uncle', 'Viscount', 'Mabrey', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies', 'trying', 'push', 'Mia', 'line', 'throne', 'get', 'Nicholas', 'crowned', 'King', 'way', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'just', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'accomplish', 'wicked', 'plan.I', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'Meg', 'Cabot', 'PRINCESS', 'DIARIES', 'book', 'series', 'years', 'was', 'ecstatic', 'find', 'THE', 'PRINCESS', 'DIARIES', '2', 'was', 'being', 'released', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'ELLA', 'ENCHANTED', 'NICHOLAS', 'NICKLEBY', 'once', 'again', 'shines', 'role', 'clumsy', 'yet', 'lovable', 'Princess', 'Mia', 'big', 'eyes', 'bright', 'smile', 'light', 'up', 'screen', 'scene', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'ELOISE', 'AT', 'THE', 'PLAZA', 'THE', 'SOUND', 'OF', 'MUSIC', 'sometimes-strict', 'incredibly', 'fun', 'Grandmere', 'appearances', 'Heather', 'Matarazzo', 'WELCOME', 'TO', 'THE', 'DOLLHOUSE', 'THE', 'PRINCESS', 'DIARIES', 'Raven', 'THAT', 'SO', 'RAVEN', 'DR.', 'DOLITTLE', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'other', 'marvelous', 'supporting', 'characters', 'who', 'truly', 'bring', 'movie', 'life', 'THE', 'PRINCESS', 'DIARIES', '2', 'truly', 'proves', 'miracles', 'do', 'happen.Erika', 'SoroccoBook', 'Review', 'Columnist', 'Community', 'Bugle', 'Newspaper']",N/A

Only a handful of films have really bettered its processer such as Lord of the Rings, Toy Story 2 and in some ways Shrek 2. Most people have mixed opinions on those movies.... but I am 200% certain that Princess Diaries 2 is definately better than the first! It's funnier, sweeter, more meaningful and has a really good soundtrack.Briefly, ""Royal Engagement"" picks up five years after bubbly, clumsy Mia discovered she was infact the heir to the throne of Genovia. The original characters return including Mia (ofcourse) Queen Clariese, Lilly, Joe... and of course Fat Louis! Princess Mia is enjoying post-college life and looking forward to getting her hands dirty in her soon-to-be-hers country. However, her quest towards the throne is chucked into uncertainty when another heir to Genovia (a man) means she must marry within 30 days... or remain ""just Mia"" forever! It's foot-popping stuff when the very guy that could end the era of Mia's family forever is the one she falls for...As I mentioned before, there is so much more depth to this chapter than the first one. The acting is more believable, the story is funner and the relationships are far more compassionate. Did I mention it is really really funny?!Despite the fact that this storyline has been used UMPTEEN times before, ""Princess Diaries 2"" really is a sweet, fresh tale. With a sprinkle of royal magic, legendary appearences by Julie Andrews and John Rease-Davies (Gilmi, Lord of the Rings), and a perfect soundtrack which really adds a shine to the picture.The film is beautifully executed and is a treat for the whole family!

It was fun to see Mia's loudmouth, activist friend hit it off with a loudmouthed royal guard. The other royal heir has his own identity struggles, as he really likes Mia and doesn't want to rule Genovia and take it from Mia like his uncle does. He fails as a gigolo, which drives a lot of the jokes, as do the paparazzi. The slumber party was amusing, and even the poodle Maurice and then the Queen take a turn on the mattress slide. I am sorry they clipped the scenes they did, because it would have explained some of the other scenes. I applaud the lack of graphic kissing, implied sex acts, swearing and nudity. This is good, clean fun with some wit, and a nice female fantasy line.

Often I wish that I could be like that, myself; that I could just watch an idiotic, fluffy chick flick and not roll my eyes at every scene or gag at the bad writing; that I, too, could have found this movie silly but enjoyable.  You see, though, I have a problem: I cannot turn off my brain.  If you share my deficiency, perhaps you should read my review and take my warnings into account.  If you CAN turn off your brain, well, enjoy the movie.For the record, I haven't read the books.  I tried to read a Meg Cabot novel once and gave up after about the third page of the girl going ""Oooh, I'm SO INDEPENDENT AND SASSY.  I am truly the heroine to root for!""I tried to find reasons for it.  I mean, I like a lot of predictable chick flicks.  Heck, before my mom turned on the Princess Diaries 2 I had been rewatching the Kim Possible movie that was airing on the Disney Channel.  What was different about this movie?  Why was I just not getting into it?  Surely, there must have been SOME reasons.First off, I blame the romances.  It wasn't a good sign when the movie wrote off Michael like a bad Mary Sue fanfic: I mean come on, only ONE line that was just ""Oh, the supposed love of my life is off touring with his band.  And I'm totally fine with it, because it's not like the first movie stressed that I was head-over-heels in love with him... oh, wait.""  I'm not going to be like the girls here who absolutely hate that he wasn't in it, because I wasn't that fond of the romance in the first movie, but I absolutely hate when sequels do that.  It was like Pocahontas 2 (another terrible sequel): ""Hey, guess what, John Smith?  I like John Rolfe now, even though the first movie basically said that we were soul mates and completely meant for each other!""  At least, though, Pocahontas 2 didn't relegate John Smith to being written off in ONE LINE.  That's just sloppy writing.  If I'd cared about the couple, I would probably be pretty mad.Anyway, sorry for my tangent.  The problem is that we're introduced to two new guys: hot British Guy (Andrew,) and Pretty Boy Who's Being Puppeteered by His Machiavellian Uncle But Is Actually Really Nice Deep Down (Nicholas.)  Mia has no chemistry with hot British guy (possibly due to the writing, because, like David Boreanz, if the guy is cute enough he can have chemistry with ANYONE.)  This is okay though, because she's not supposed to.  But then there's Pretty Boy, who is supposed to make Mia realize that while her pairing with Hot British Guy is a lot more practical and useful, she needs true romance in her life.  (A sidenote: Oh God, please Disney, STOP with the arranged marriage crap.  Mulan 2's premise was based entirely on the notion that ""Arranged Marriages are BAD even though they actually had a pretty high success rate!""  And poor Mia, having to marry a cute prince of her choice!  I TRULY felt for her.)  The problem is, Mia had no chemistry with that guy!  And let me stress something: when the plot involves Mia cheating on someone with someone else, that someone else had better be someone who, when he is with her, heats up the screen.  The whole love/hate premise, too, relies on how much chemistry they have.  When they were arguing, I never got the feeling ""Oh, just make out already!""  I'm serious.  You need Monica and Richard from Friends-level chemistry, or at least something more than ""He's cute so I guess I'll like him.""  I don't even know why Mia liked him.  I never did.Next, I blame the plot.  I already got into the arranged marriage issue, but when they introduced the villain, Pretty Boy's Uncle, he says something like ""You wouldn't want to lose that crown: other people may grab it.""  We are subtly given the message that this guy is someone on whom we should keep an eye.  But then the writers, thinking that its audience is absolutely stupid, makes him add ""Like me.""  Oh, thanks writers, I NEVER would have gotten that.  So nice that you took the time to clear that up.  Then there are all of these references to The Prince (no, not the guy who performed at the Super Bowl Half Time Show) just to fool those of us above the age of 11 into thinking that we were watching something remotely intelligent.  Nice try, movie.Next is the movie's fatal flaw: the happy kingdom of Genovia.  First off, what the heck kind of government does Genovia have?  If it's a constitutional monarchy, Mia's going to be pretty disappointed in what she can all do.  If it's not, which I think it is because I sort of got that Monarchy vibe, is this not the 21st century?  Is our need for princesses so great that we'll take a leaf out of Hobbes's book?  And what kind of name is Genovia, anyway?  Couldn't Ms. Cabot have chosen a name that didn't sound completely made up?  And couldn't they at least chose one uniform accent?  I think Italian would have worked; Genovia seemed more Italian than anything.  Anyway, we're supposed to believe that Genovians are these happy people who just LOVE having a Queen and even better if she's a 21-year-old (that's barely even legal to drink back in the USA) foreigner whom they barely know!  YAY!  And servants are also happy people with no needs of their own, who will do anything to please their princess, including tap routines?  Again, this is probably because of that problem of not being able to turn off my brain that I have, but what kind of message is that?  Even in the 18th century people were writing about servants who were wittier and more cunning than their masters, who had more of a purpose than just to serve them.  Is such a gigantic step backwards necessary just to give a young girl a happy princess fantasy?Basically, Genovia in this movie reminded me so much of Ancien Regime France vibe that all I could do was wonder when the people would get fed up enough and the Revolution would happen.  I can see it now: Princess Diaries 3: Off With Her Head!  Wouldn't that make a good movie?  At least it'd have a REAL plot instead of some tripe chick flick-arranged marriage nonsense.  Really, I'd watch it.  In fact, if you're reading this, Disney, give me a call.  I truly think that I have something here.  Also, with the way Mia was spending money (People are poor here?  Oh, we must help them even though my closet is probably bigger than most Genovians' kitchens!  And they must be orphans!  Everyone LOVES orphans!) I'm not sure how long those royal funds will last.Another issue I think is that, well, we know nothing about Genovia other than that they have a lucrative pear industry.  And, the audience probably being mostly American, we're most likely not apt to buy into that patriotic royalist stuff.  Honestly, even most British people that I know insult their own monarchy on a regular basis.  What is the Genovian history?  What has kept them so placated?  Have they tried other government systems before and decided that this one worked best?  Surely not all of the rulers have been Julie Andrews and Anne Hathaway's deceased father; there must have been some inept and possibly tyrannical Kings and/or Queens beforehand. And surely some years there must have been some meager pear harvests, which if we take the impression from the lavicious palaces and suites in which the royalty reside, would not have hampered royal spending.  Come on, even in Aladdin the people were shown as impoverished and pretty miserable while the Sultan sat in the palace playing with his toys.  Must Disney shelter its audiences to the point where it's ridiculous?  All we're shown in this movie as to the darker side of Genovia are orphans.  Please, Disney, I'm begging you: dig a LITTLE deeper.  Or at least ditch the stereotypical ""eager-to-please"" servants; while I know you intended them to be humorous, the portrayal was stupid and in truth maybe even a little offensive.I won't skewer the ""Girl Power"" moments in the film because, honestly, they really do it to themselves.  I did, however, laugh when they had Raven Simone in it.  And she was singing.  Every Disney show/movie MUST have Raven in it, and at some point she must sing.  It's a given.  I was infuriated though that she got to sing with Julie freaking Andrews.  That was like Michael Bolton singing ""O soave fanciulla"" from La Boheme with Renee Fleming on his CD.  Sad.Anyway, like I said, if you can turn off your brain and not analyze things to death like I do, you might enjoy this movie.  If you are more like me though, you should probably avoid it.  Especially if someone who likes it is watching it, because at some point she'll probably kick you out of the room after one too many snarky comments.",1,Excuse me--what century is this?,1171065600,"02

However, ROYAL ENGAGEMENT has a few things going for it that save it from utter lacklusterness.  Especially, Julie Andrews singing again after the tragic node operation that cut short one of Broadway's most famous sopranos.  I don't understand exactly, for didn't she win $30 million dollars from the surgeons who butchered her during a routine operation?  Now that she can sing again, does she have to give the money back?  I wouldn't dare open my mouth if it meant I'd have to pay back thirty dollars, much less 30 million.  Anyway, she yaks her way through a charming little song called ""Your Crowning Glory,"" staged as an entertainment for Mia's bridal shower/slash/slumber party, and she hits all the notes: I don't know, was that sequence sweetened up in the studio?  Other reviewers hated the part where young black superstar ""Raven"" pops up to turn ""Crowning Glory"" into a duet, adding some semi-urban stylings.  I thought it was great!  Raven could do all the big notes, while Dame Julie could putter along in the background.But what happened to Julie Andrews' face?  She was once a lovely woman, and she looked fantastic in PRINCESS DIARIES part I, but plastic surgeons did her over, I fear, one too many times, for she can hardly either open her eyes up all the way, nor close them completely, so she always looks tipsy and sleepy, even when she's supposed to be wide awake and furious.  She wears a series of jumpers and tweed skirts in this movie, always fetching, but come on, give her a little glamor!  And having Hector Elizondo as your boyfriend doesn't give a mature woman glamor!  How about Robert Redford or someone who at least ONCE was a heart-throb.  We all know that Hector plays in every one of Garry Marshall's movies, but enough is enough, he's nothing.Where is Genovia supposed to be, anyhow?  It looks sort of like Switzerland, or the Central European country to which Ethel Merman served as US ambassador in CALL ME MADAM.  And yet all the principal characters have names from Olde England, like Lord Devereaux.Anne Hathaway is no Hayley Mills, but she's cute when she's klutzy, and the only thing worth reporting on the romance front is that Chris Pine makes the young man from the first movie seem like Tyrone Power, and the film-makers utterly wasted their opportunity.  They had the divine Callum Blue (who starred in Showtime's DEAD LIKE ME, often naked) in the cast, as the fiancee, Andrew Jacoby, and they never let him do a thing, much less get the girl.  Is Callum Blue doomed always to play the Pagliacci figure?  There should be ten films a year, as in the old studio system, exploiting his radiant, potent masculinity!  Not this misbegotten mess of nostalgia for Genovian pride!

The first film was absolutely hilarious, but this one just really wasn't all that funny to me. I like Anne Hathaway, I really do, but I think it's about time for her to ""Breakaway"" from these little, cute, teen pop movies because it's really getting stale to me now. Come on, you have both of the ""Princess Diaries"", and then there's ""Ella Enchanted"" another cute movie. I just really wanna see Anne do something else now, and that's probably why I wasn't all that impressed with this. Don't get me wrong, the films are cute for children, but enough is enough now.In response to Osiris. I'm sure that you can appreciate Anne's work, and I can too, but the only gripe I have is that she needs to do something else. I am a movie finatic. Afterall, that's what I do for a living. At some point, I would hope to see Anne branch out into other kinds of movies. I think she's absolutely gorgeous, and maybe she should try playing a vixen or villian for once. The movies are cute without a doubt, but cute just for children. Anne is not the only actress that I've said the exact same thing about. Ashley Judd is another one that can't step out of the box. That's another topic though. It's just that after awhile watching the same actress or actor doing the same kinds of films gets a bit redundant, and when that happens it's time to step out of the box. There is a lot of competition out there these days, and cute just doesn't cut it for too long anymore. There are just too many teen stars popping up, and Anne is an adult now. Therefore, it's time for her to move on to more adult roles. Come on, the teen movie genre is overflowing with young teen stars, and if that's all I wanted to see then I could just watch Lindsay Lohan, Hilary Duff, Alexa Vega, or Raven Symone. I absolutely loved the first ""Princess Diaries"" I just don't them to run that into the ground.

857900,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00063KGPU,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 5]","At the end of the original film, ""The Princess Diaries,"" there was one major plot thread left unresolved.  Mia Thermopolis (Anne Hathaway) had discovered that she was a princess and heir to the throne of Genovia, one of those European postage stamp countries.  More importantly, she got the boy, as did her single mom mother, Helen (Caroline Goodall).  But Queen Clarisse Renaldi (Julie Andrews), still had to keep Joe (Hector Elizondo) at arm's length, so when I heard the cast was back for ""The Princess Diaries 2 - Royal Engagment,"" I had happy thoughts that the great unconsummated love between the Queen and her head body guard would finally move from column B to column A.However, the focal point of this 2004 sequel is again Princess Mia, who has returned to Genovia from getting her degree in political studies in the United States and is ready to complete her training so that Queen Clarisse can hand over the crown.  Queen Clarisse is an extremely popular and beloved monarch, so her turning over the crown to a young American is supposed to seem like a good idea.  That is because why we have engaging characters in engaging roles, the story telling here leaves a lot to be desired, mainly because you can see the plot line stretching out throughout the rest of the film as soon as you meet all of the characters and understand the dilemma.It seems there is a hitch in the grand plan to make Mia queen of Genovia, mainly that the queen has to be hitched in order to become queen.  Apparently Genovia has a constitutional monarchy with this sexist provision and the obvious solution to the problem does not occur to any one until the penultimate scene of the film.  A compromise is reached and Princess Mia is given one month to get married.  Fortunately, the rolpdex for European royalty is up to date and computerized and Andrew Jacoby, Duke of Kensington (Callum Blue), is picked to be the lucky groom.  After all, Queen Clarisse had an arranged marriage, so it should be able to work out for Princess Mia.  Besides, name a royal marriage in recent years (since the millenium) that has failed.The other reason for Mia to be in a hurry to get hitched is that there is another claimant to the throne, Sir Nicholas (Chris Pine), the nephew of Viscount Mabrey (John Rhys-Davies), who reveres Niccolo Machiavelli and mentions him often enough that the young teenager girls that will love this movie might actually ask a teacher about who this dead European white male is and why he is mentioned so frequently in a Disney movie.  Mabrey wants Nicholas to have the throne, so sabotaging Mia's romance with Andrew is a high priority, and since Mia is prone to loveable mishaps on her own, that might be have the battle right there.  But there is some actual sparkage between Mia and Nicholas, and the the movie heads towards its obvious plot points.Equally obvious is how ""The Princess Diaries 2"" is geared for young girls, more of the sort that attend Princess Mia's bridal shower slumber party than anything else.  But my favorite parts are still anything involving either the Queen or Joe.  The bald headed guy with the beard getting the girl is certainly more my idea of a storybook romance, plus there is a reason that Garry Marshall is always putting Elizondo in his films.  So, for me this film was okay, and it actually picks up points for the final scene being the final scene, especially given the way the film is doing everything else by the numbers.  Still, there are not any really sweet romantic moments like there was in ""The Prince and Me,"" and for Hathaway fans ""Ella Enchanted"" is a much better film fairytale.  Andrews and Elizondo have certainly been in some much better movies as well.",3,"Okay, Princess Mia, fine.

It is a ""G"" rated film, so the plot is fairly simple and straightforward with a lot of light comedic touches. This is a film that will appeal to young and old alike, even though its targeted audience appears to be young girls.This film picks up where the first one left off.  Mia Thermopolis, Princess of Genovia (Anne Hathaway) has just graduated from college and is now twenty-one years of age. Her mother has married her high school teacher, and they are expecting a baby. Her best friend, Lilly Moscovitz (Heather Matarazzo) is now a student at UCLA at Berkeley. Mia's grandmother, Clarisse Renaldi (Julie Andrews), is still Queen of Genovia but plans to step down at year's end so that Mia can be crowned the new Queen. Joseph (Hector Elizondo) is still head of security for Queen Clarisse with whom he is still in love.When Princess Mia returns to Genovia upon graduation, together with her pampered black and white cat, Fat Louie, she gets ready to assume her exalted position. Unfortunately, Viscount Maybrey (John Rhys-Davies) throws a monkey wrench into the plan, citing an age old law that requires would be Queens to marry within thirty days or forfeit the right to wear the crown as Queen. Of course, should she be unable to do so, Viscount Maybrey's nephew, Lord Nicholas Devereaux (Chris Pine), is next in line for the throne and would then be crowned King of Genovia, a young and handsome man whom Mia has already met at the formal reception welcoming her to Genovia.Let the Games begin! As Mia and Clarisse hunt for a suitable husband, Viscount Maybrey schemes to ensure that the crown passes to his nephew.Mia and Clarisse finally come up with a suitable arranged marriage prospect from England, Lord Andrew Jacoby (Callum Blue). The only questions are whether or not Mia will go through with the arranged marriage or whether she will fall in love with the handsome Lord Devereaux. Mia will undergo many funny and trying situations, as she tries to decide what to do. Will she follow her head or her heart? The fates, however, will also have their say. Of course, Queen Clarisse has her own issues, as she tries to decide what to do about Joseph, the man she has always loved, and who also loves her.Anne Hathaway is, as always, perfectly delightful and beautiful in every scene. She has a fresh-faced naivet&eacute; that perfectly suits the role of Princess Mia. Julie Andrew is, of course, totally charming and perfectly regal as the lovely Queen Clarisse. A seemingly svelte John Rhys-Davies, however, almost steals the show as the diabolical Viscount Maybrey. Chris Pine is a little wooden as the hunky, Lord Devereaux.  I miss Lilly's brother, Michael (Robert Schwartzman), the handsome, good guy who won Mia's heart in the prequel. Callum Blue is perfect as the pleasant and polite Lord Andrew Jacoby.  Hector Elizondo is marvelous in the role of the faithful Joseph. Heather Matarazzo has a few brief winning moments in the film, looking out for Mia's interests, after she travels to Genovia as a surprise for Mia. It was also nice to see Tom Poston in the small role of Lord Palimore.Garry Marshall does an excellent job in directing the cast, keeping the mood of the film light and playful throughout. This is a film that is really squeaky clean, so parents can rest assure that it really is suitable for children of all ages, although young girls are the ones that will adore this fairytale of a film.",4,...AND THEY LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER....,1125964800,"09 6, 2005",2005,3493,"['surprise', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'prequel', 'G', 'rated', 'film', 'plot', 'fairly', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'lot', 'light', 'comedic', 'touches', 'film', 'will', 'appeal', 'young', 'old', 'alike', 'even', 'targeted', 'audience', 'be', 'young', 'girls.This', 'film', 'up', 'where', 'first', 'one', 'left', 'off', 'Mia', 'Thermopolis', 'Princess', 'Genovia', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'just', 'graduated', 'college', 'now', 'twenty-one', 'years', 'age', 'mother', 'married', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'are', 'expecting', 'baby', 'best', 'friend', 'Lilly', 'Moscovitz', 'Heather', 'Matarazzo', 'now', 'student', 'UCLA', 'Berkeley', 'Mia', 'grandmother', 'Clarisse', 'Renaldi', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'still', 'Queen', 'Genovia', 'plans', 'step', 'down', 'year', 'end', 'so', 'Mia', 'can', 'be', 'crowned', 'new', 'Queen', 'Joseph', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'still', 'head', 'security', 'Queen', 'Clarisse', 'whom', 'still', 'love.When', 'Princess', 'Mia', 'Genovia', 'graduation', 'together', 'pampered', 'black', 'white', 'cat', 'Fat', 'Louie', 'ready', 'assume', 'exalted', 'position', 'Unfortunately', 'Viscount', 'Maybrey', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies', 'monkey', 'wrench', 'plan', 'citing', 'age', 'old', 'law', 'would', 'be', 'Queens', 'marry', 'thirty', 'days', 'forfeit', 'right', 'wear', 'crown', 'Queen', 'course', 'should', 'be', 'unable', 'do', 'so', 'Viscount', 'Maybrey', 'nephew', 'Lord', 'Nicholas', 'Devereaux', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'next', 'line', 'throne', 'would', 'then', 'be', 'crowned', 'King', 'Genovia', 'young', 'handsome', 'man', 'whom', 'Mia', 'already', 'met', 'formal', 'reception', 'welcoming', 'Genovia.Let', 'Games', 'begin', 'Mia', 'Clarisse', 'hunt', 'suitable', 'husband', 'Viscount', 'Maybrey', 'ensure', 'crown', 'passes', 'nephew.Mia', 'Clarisse', 'finally', 'come', 'up', 'suitable', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'prospect', 'England', 'Lord', 'Andrew', 'Jacoby', 'Callum', 'Blue', 'only', 'questions', 'are', 'not', 'Mia', 'will', 'go', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'handsome', 'Lord', 'Devereaux', 'Mia', 'will', 'undergo', 'many', 'funny', 'trying', 'situations', 'decide', 'what', 'do', 'Will', 'follow', 'head', 'heart', 'fates', 'however', 'will', 'also', 'have', 'say', 'course', 'Queen', 'Clarisse', 'own', 'issues', 'decide', 'what', 'do', 'Joseph', 'man', 'always', 'loved', 'who', 'also', 'her.Anne', 'Hathaway', 'always', 'perfectly', 'delightful', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'fresh-faced', 'naivet', 'eacute', 'perfectly', 'suits', 'role', 'Princess', 'Mia', 'Julie', 'Andrew', 'course', 'totally', 'charming', 'perfectly', 'regal', 'lovely', 'Queen', 'Clarisse', 'A', 'seemingly', 'svelte', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies', 'however', 'almost', 'show', 'diabolical', 'Viscount', 'Maybrey', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'little', 'wooden', 'hunky', 'Lord', 'Devereaux', 'miss', 'Lilly', 'brother', 'Michael', 'Robert', 'Schwartzman', 'handsome', 'good', 'guy', 'who', 'won', 'Mia', 'heart', 'prequel', 'Callum', 'Blue', 'perfect', 'pleasant', 'polite', 'Lord', 'Andrew', 'Jacoby', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'marvelous', 'role', 'faithful', 'Joseph', 'Heather', 'Matarazzo', 'few', 'brief', 'winning', 'moments', 'film', 'looking', 'out', 'Mia', 'interests', 'Genovia', 'surprise', 'Mia', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'Tom', 'Poston', 'small', 'role', 'Lord', 'Palimore.Garry', 'Marshall', 'excellent', 'job', 'directing', 'cast', 'keeping', 'mood', 'film', 'light', 'playful', 'film', 'really', 'squeaky', 'clean', 'parents', 'can', 'rest', 'assure', 'really', 'suitable', 'children', 'ages', 'young', 'girls', 'are', 'ones', 'will', 'adore', 'fairytale', 'film']",N/A
857902,A18HHKM6WGEF9D,B00063KGPU,"L. Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[1, 1]","Committed young fans of the first movie, such as my 7-year old daughter, will probably like this, but otherwise, it doesn't stand up to the first movie. The writing is much choppier, and the storyline not as compelling. In this one, Anne Hathaway has returned to the kingdom of Genovia after completing college (where she studied international politics) to learn how to be a queen from her grandmother/queen, again played by Julia Andrews. However, it turns out there is a very old law on the books that states that a woman cannot ascend to the throne without a husband, and another royal relative seeks to exploit this and place his nephew, who is next in line, on the throne instead. Why the throne has to be handed off now, with the Queen still in such good shape, is never actually explained, and for some reason it doesn't occur to anyone initially to try and change the law. So a 30-day deadline is imposed, and the Princess decides to seek to marry within that time.The first movie worked partly because Anne Hathaway's character and her friends were young, smart, somewhat hip San Franciscans who thought the whole idea of royalty was a bit silly. This outside view helped make the whole thing palatable to those of us that aren't quite comfortable with all the princess myths that confront our daughters. In this film, it's all taken way too seriously. Suddenly this independent, smart, modern young American woman is willing to accept an arranged marriage in the 21st century? Within 30 days? It just didn't quite work. Even the real Prince William got to marry for love! The incredible wealth that is displayed - with the Princess being given drawers and drawers of jewels, and rooms full of clothes and shoes, also didn't feel quite as whimsical or fun this time around, with the world in the midst of a recession. We also don't get the fun of Princess Mia undergoing a makeover.So I watched with perhaps a bit of a jaded eye, and just didn't quite enjoy this one. It didn't feel like Anne Hathaway was enjoying it as much either, and after the serious critical success she has had since the first movie, this sequel must have felt like quite a step back.On the other hand, as I said, my daughter did enjoy it, and in the end Princess Mia and Genovia do come to their senses.",3,"Fell Pretty Far Short of Original, Although Committed Young Fans May Like It",1325203200,"12 30, 2011",2011,2287,"['Committed', 'young', 'fans', 'first', 'movie', 'such', '7-year', 'old', 'daughter', 'will', 'probably', 'otherwise', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', 'first', 'movie', 'writing', 'much', 'choppier', 'storyline', 'not', 'compelling', 'one', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'returned', 'kingdom', 'Genovia', 'completing', 'college', 'where', 'studied', 'international', 'politics', 'learn', 'how', 'be', 'queen', 'grandmother/queen', 'again', 'played', 'Julia', 'Andrews', 'However', 'out', 'very', 'old', 'law', 'books', 'woman', 'can', 'not', 'ascend', 'throne', 'husband', 'royal', 'relative', 'seeks', 'exploit', 'place', 'nephew', 'who', 'next', 'line', 'throne', 'instead', 'Why', 'throne', 'be', 'handed', 'off', 'now', 'Queen', 'still', 'such', 'good', 'shape', 'never', 'actually', 'explained', 'reason', ""n't"", 'occur', 'anyone', 'initially', 'try', 'change', 'law', '30-day', 'deadline', 'imposed', 'Princess', 'seek', 'marry', 'time.The', 'first', 'movie', 'worked', 'partly', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'character', 'friends', 'were', 'young', 'smart', 'somewhat', 'hip', 'San', 'Franciscans', 'who', 'thought', 'whole', 'idea', 'royalty', 'was', 'bit', 'silly', 'outside', 'view', 'helped', 'make', 'whole', 'thing', 'palatable', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'comfortable', 'princess', 'myths', 'confront', 'daughters', 'film', 'taken', 'way', 'too', 'seriously', 'Suddenly', 'independent', 'smart', 'modern', 'young', 'American', 'woman', 'willing', 'accept', 'arranged', 'marriage', '21st', 'century', '30', 'days', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'Even', 'real', 'Prince', 'William', 'got', 'marry', 'love', 'incredible', 'wealth', 'displayed', 'Princess', 'being', 'given', 'drawers', 'drawers', 'jewels', 'rooms', 'full', 'clothes', 'shoes', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'quite', 'whimsical', 'fun', 'time', 'around', 'world', 'midst', 'recession', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'fun', 'Princess', 'Mia', 'undergoing', 'makeover.So', 'watched', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'jaded', 'eye', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'enjoy', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'was', 'enjoying', 'much', 'serious', 'critical', 'success', 'had', 'first', 'movie', 'sequel', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'quite', 'step', 'other', 'hand', 'said', 'daughter', 'did', 'enjoy', 'end', 'Princess', 'Mia', 'Genovia', 'do', 'come', 'senses']",N/A

Now out of college, she's moving to her country full time to take over the thrown from her grandmother.  There's just one tiny problem.  According to the law, no woman can rule without a husband at her side.  Now Mia has just 30 days to find a husband and get married or she forfeits the thrown.A suitable match is found in Andrew Jacoby.  As the country gears up for a royal wedding, Mia's heart seems to be going toward Nicholas Devereaux, the man out to steal her thrown.  And Mia isn't the only one facing matters of the heart.  Queen Clarisse is facing her own romantic future.Ok, I know I'm not the target market of pre-adolescent girls.  But I love it anyway.  It's a cute, fun movie.  Predictable?  You better believe it.  But it entertains so much along the way I don't care.  There are lots of funny bits from all the characters; I especially enjoy the maids.  On the other hand, I could have done without the sleepover scene.  Probably that not in the target audience thing coming up again.I must admit I had to get over the fact that Michael wasn't back.  I really liked their relationship from the first movie.  And I was also disappointed that Mia's mom and step-dad had such small rolls.  Still, I really liked the way Mia has matured between films.  She's still a klutz and not royal by any stretch of the imagination, but it's not as overdone as the first.  Also, the relationship between Mia and Clarisse has really improved.  I loved it more then in the first movie.Disney has released a fun DVD for this movie.  Movie fans will enjoy the bloopers, and the deleted scenes were interesting.  There's a commentary with Julie Andrews and Garry Marshall.  The behind the scenes featurette is mostly interesting, but obviously aimed at fans of the music in the movie.  The rest of the features caterer to girls, with a makeover segment, Kelly Clarkson music video, and a princess personality quiz.This is an entertaining movie that the entire family can enjoy together.

857909,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B00063KGPU,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[20, 24]","The Princess Diaries 2 uses the magic of the original to craft a cute and entertaining fairy tale. Set 5 years after the original, the film follows Mia Thermopolis (Anne Hathaway), now 21, as she graduates college and settles in Genovia to take over her grandmother's role as queen. Unfortunately, Genovian rules state that in order for Mia to become queen, she must first marry. As if that's not complicated enough, Mia has only thirty days to find herself a husband.Into this simple plot, screenwriter Shonda Rhimes and director Garry Marshall have injected humor, fantasy, and a good, old-fashioned love story. Practically everyone from the original is back, except for Robert Schwartzman as Micheal, who is ""off touring with his band,"" and Mandy Moore, whose character couldn't really fit into the plot. The result is a very enjoyable film that is almost, but not quite, as good as the original. Fans were upset at Schwartzman's refusal to appear in the film because of his newfound fame as lead singer of the band ""Rooney,"" but the story would not have worked with him anyway and this is all for the best. The most anyone could have hoped for was a cameo, but it isn't neccessary. The film works best without Micheal present and at least his character is given a mention. So get over it!!!Anne Hathaway was born to play Princess Mia. She is beautiful, innocent, and charming. This is the role she will be remembered for the rest of her life. Julie Andrews is her usually fabulous self as the Queen. Calm, sophisticated, and beautiful, it is a pleasure seeing her on screen and hearing her lovely singing voice once again. Raven, of The Cosby Show and That's so Raven fame, has a wonderful cameo role and gets to belt out a tune with the lovely Andrews. An unneccessary scene, but wonderful nontheless.The film is a young girl's delight, but one parents can enjoy along with their children. It's  light, fun, and fluffy escapism from beginning to end. While not as good as the first, it comes pretty close. In fact, the ending really made me long for a third. Judging by Wednsday's box-office numbers, the film is going to be a hit and a third might actually not be far off.

OK, it has a really sweet ending, and Mandy Moore doesn't return - thank God. It's alright to watch, but it's pretty iffy, and Heather Matarazzo gets less of a storyline. Her funniest line though, HAS to be walking down the aisle, saying: ""I'm a girl who likes black, who's wearing pink"" or something to that effect.The mattress surfing scene has to be the highlight of the movie, especially, for which Julie Andrews did her own ""stunt"" - hardly something I would call a stunt, but you never know. There's also a cheeky reference to Julie's role in Mary Poppins, so keep your ears open for that.Allan Kent reappears in this movie, as he did in another of Garry Marshall's not so well known movies, called Pretty Woman. When Princess Mia is introduced at the ball, his character catches her ring and says, ""It happens all the time."" Kent also appears in The Princess Diaries where he says the same thing when Mia breaks her glass, and in Pretty Woman where he says it as he catches the escargot that escapes from Viv's plate. Larry Millar also reappears as the mad hairdresser.I didn't relate to this movie as much as the previous one, due to the fact, Princess Mia's transformation from ugly duckling into swan reminded me so much of myself, but that obviously doesn't reappear in this.

As a fluffy, vicarious fun experience, it gets 5 stars. As far as the plot goes, it's every 12 year old girls dream. Become a princess, get in line to be queen, have to marry because of tradition, throw that radition out the window, and end up with that guy you hated at the beginning, but have since discovered is your true match. Ok, it sounds incredibly cliched and it is, but it's enjoyable. Anne Hathaway is perfectly charming as Mia. I like that even though she's been a princess for a few years that she still has the flaws that she had at the beginning of the first movie and that she doesn't just accept the tradition, but tries to get around it and won't marry one man just to have the crown. Julie Andrews is simply wonderful, but that's to be expected. Her duet with Raven while kind of not cool is still likely to have Andrews fan happy to see her singing again. Hector Elizondo is good as everyone's favorite bodyguard and fans of the Clarisse/Joseph romance will leave the theater happy. I wasn't all that thrilled to hear that Robert Carmine(Michael for PD 1) wasn't returning, but there are two guys involved with Mia in this one.

The movie is way too long with scenes that are merely meant to titillate its target audience of pre-teens, and to sell more soundtrack albums.  But the delightful Anne Hathaway (who shows her acting mettle in more recent films like BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN and HAVOC) is still a fetching princess queen-to-be, and her presence alone gives the movie a much needed boost.  The writers saddled her with a completely unlikeable love match (a hunky but shallow Chris Pine), and by the time the movie reaches its emancipative climax, one has pretty much tired of the movie.  Julie Andrews is remarkable as always as the queen, and Hector Elizondo shines in his role as her secret admirer.  Their classy presence likewise elevates the film.  But John Rhys Davies as the conspiratory viscount and even Heather Matarazzo are merely annoying set pieces meant to advance the plot, and they don't do it that well either.

But they are trying to make this part of the Princess Diaries series so I can't like them as much. While I adore Anne Hathaway, her version of Princess Mia is nothing like the spunky kind of outcast like girl (who might I mention has blonde hair, not brown hair) that was presented in the books and I grew to adore. It starts after Princess Mia graduated from college and is getting ready to take over for her grandmother as Queen of Genovia, that in itself is a false thing because in the book Genovia was a pricipality like Monaco so they never took up the title of King or Queen just Prince or Princess. Then they state that Mia and Michael who which was the central romance of the series were broken up because they just wanted to be friends (Spolier Alert: In the later books Michael and Mia did break up for a couple of years and it caused Mia to have so much emotional stress that she had to go into therapy, I don't think that the way that Anne's Mia took the break up was all that realistic to Mia). When she arrives to Genovia they find out that some outdated law states that Mia has to marry before she can take up the throne (Spoiler Alert: If you read the books you would have known tha the history of Genovia started when a woman strangled an evil military ruler with her own braid and the head of Italy or France gave her a small piece of land that she could rule on her own as Princess and she was single when she became Princess, a rule like that in a country like Genovia was just silly). Not to mention that her grandmother was running the show since her husband died in the movie and things weren't falling to ruin. So Mia decicdes to get with the first guy that seems decent and they decide to marry, I would think that women like Mia and her friend Lily would have had some very strong objections to a thing like this if they were true to the books. But Mia was alrihgt with that aside from the fact that she starts to secretly swoon for her rival for the throne and all Lily seems to care about is all of the fancy stuff that she got to have by being the friend of Mia, the real Lily would have jumped onto her soap bow and told how it was unfair that the royalty of Genovia lived a life of decadence while there were people who were starving to death and they it was stupid that Mia was expected to follow this Medevial rule when women proved that they could rule on their own. I didn't enjoy the romance of Mia and Nicholas at all, especially after the book version of Michael was such a great guy and was perfect for Mia.

Once again, Disney used the formula and got it right. In the adorable sequel to 2001's The Princess Diaries,""Anne Hathaway returns as Amelia Minonette Thermopolis Renaldi. She's still gawky, she's still clumsy, but she's now turning 21 years old and is a bit more mature.A recent graduate of Princeton, Mia is now moving to Genovia to learn how to rule; her grandmother Queen Clarisse Renaldi (Julie Andrews, in a wonderful reprisal role) will have to teach her poise, decorum and diplomacy before stepping down as queen of Genovia, so Mia can be crowned. Best friend Lily (Heather Matarazzo) is attending Berkeley, and Mia and Lily's brother Michael (Robert Schwartzman) are now just friends, as Michael is off touring the country with his band. When Mia arrives in Genovia only to learn that another person is eligible for her crown, and that by Parliament's rule she must marry before 30 days is up or forfeit her crown, she is stunned! Mia has always wanted to marry for love, and who can possibly expect someone to fall in love in just 30 days?In Mia's search for an eligible Prince Charming she comes across a lovely young man named Andrew Jacoby (Callum Blue) from England, who is perfect for her in every way: but can she love him? Another is in her path as well: a guy named Nicholas (Chris Pine), with whom she dances briefly at her birthday ball (she flirts with him mildly). When Mia discovers shortly thereafter that ""Sir"" Nicholas is actually THE Lord Devereaux that is trying to steal her crown, she is quite upset! Nicholas's evil uncle Viscount Mabrey (Jonathan Rhys-Davies) is determined that his nephew should rule Genovia -- after all, Nicholas was born and raised in Genovia, and knows more about the people than ""the American born"" Mia ever could.With time running out and pressure from all sides for this ""arranged marriage"", Mia must overcome a few large obstacles: she must familiarize herself with the long-standing traditions of Genovia (such as shoot a flaming arrow through a ring on the night before her coronation), as well as learn how to be politic in dealing with sticky situations. Falling into a fountain, nearly shooting many people with arrows, stamping her heel on a young man's foot, climbing down ivy from her window and much more could hardly be considered ladylike behavior:  but who has time to be genteel and ladylike when you only have 30 days to fall in love and marry?In Disney style, this G offering has very little objectionable content: there is no bad language to speak of. There is a moment where a girl and a guy wake up together under a tree, but it is adamantly declared that nothing has happened. There is mild flirting, a few temper tantrums (understandable ones), and little else. This movie is so clean, that I would encourage you to take young children to see it! Some may say that it comes off flat and boring, but I didn't find it so.

Zwick,"[7, 11]","*1/2In the original ""Princess Diaries,"" San Francisco teen Mia Thermopolis discovered, just like every other red-blooded American girl, that she was next-in-line to the throne of a fictional country called Genovia - a virtually all-white kingdom (with a perpetually happy citizenry) that looks as if it had been lifted straight out of a book of fairy tales all done up in modern dress.  Now, five years later, Mia is about to turn 21, the age at which she will finally be eligible to assume her rightful place as queen of the country.  However, there turns out to be a royal fly in the ointment, for the law stipulates that she must have a king to accompany her to the throne.  Thus, Mia must find and fall in love with a man within thirty days or forego her title as queen to the nephew of a conniving, power hungry viscount who is determined to get the scepter for himself.Burdened with a dopey premise that even the lamest sitcom would reject as hopeless, ""Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement"" is an inane, mind-numbing white bread fantasy that galumphs along at a tedious pace and wastes the talents of Ann Hathaway and Julie Andrews into the bargain.  I can't imagine that even the most sheltered schoolgirl will be enchanted by the clumsy plot contrivances, tepid wit and low grade slapstick that are the hallmarks of this film.  Among its many other faults, ""Princess Diaries 2"" endorses an elitist view of benevolent monarchy - in which servants stand in the hot sun holding umbrellas for royalty - that is rather dismaying in the 21st Century.It's fun seeing Julie Andrews playing the Henry Higgins to Anne Hathaway's Eliza Doolittle for a change, but that momentary pleasure hardly compensates for the ordeal of sitting through the rest of the film.If the people who made this film were truly being honest, they would have titled it ""Princess Diaries 2: A Royal Pain in the ___.""",1,A Royal Pain,1126224000,"09 9, 2005",2005,1890,"['original', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'San', 'Francisco', 'teen', 'Mia', 'Thermopolis', 'discovered', 'just', 'other', 'red-blooded', 'American', 'girl', 'was', 'next-in-line', 'throne', 'fictional', 'country', 'called', 'Genovia', 'virtually', 'all-white', 'kingdom', 'perpetually', 'happy', 'citizenry', 'had', 'been', 'lifted', 'straight', 'book', 'fairy', 'tales', 'done', 'up', 'modern', 'dress', 'Now', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'Mia', 'turn', '21', 'age', 'will', 'finally', 'be', 'eligible', 'assume', 'rightful', 'place', 'queen', 'country', 'However', 'out', 'be', 'royal', 'fly', 'ointment', 'law', 'must', 'have', 'king', 'accompany', 'throne', 'Thus', 'Mia', 'must', 'find', 'fall', 'love', 'man', 'thirty', 'days', 'forego', 'title', 'queen', 'nephew', 'conniving', 'power', 'hungry', 'viscount', 'who', 'determined', 'get', 'scepter', 'himself.Burdened', 'dopey', 'premise', 'even', 'lamest', 'sitcom', 'would', 'reject', 'hopeless', 'Princess', '2', 'Royal', 'Engagement', 'inane', 'mind-numbing', 'white', 'bread', 'fantasy', 'along', 'tedious', 'pace', 'talents', 'Ann', 'Hathaway', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'bargain', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'even', 'most', 'sheltered', 'schoolgirl', 'will', 'be', 'enchanted', 'clumsy', 'plot', 'contrivances', 'tepid', 'wit', 'low', 'grade', 'slapstick', 'are', 'hallmarks', 'film', 'many', 'other', 'faults', 'Princess', '2', 'elitist', 'view', 'benevolent', 'monarchy', 'servants', 'stand', 'hot', 'sun', 'holding', 'umbrellas', 'royalty', 'rather', 'dismaying', '21st', 'Century.It', 'fun', 'seeing', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'playing', 'Henry', 'Higgins', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Eliza', 'Doolittle', 'change', 'momentary', 'pleasure', 'hardly', 'ordeal', 'sitting', 'rest', 'film.If', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'film', 'were', 'truly', 'being', 'honest', 'would', 'have', 'titled', 'Princess', '2', 'Royal', 'Pain', '___']",N/A

Now granted, there are many jokes that adults could appreciate, and the general story line is pretty good, but it seems as if the writers decided to ""dumb down"" the second movie a bit to appeal to the under 12 crowd. There were many scenes that didn't do anything to advance the plot, but were clearly put in there to amuse young girls--such as the overblown closet scene where we get to see all of Mia's clothes and jewelry for no real reason but to ooh and ah over them, a parade scene where Mia invites orphan girls to join in and be ""princesses"", and of course the infamous slumber party scene where Mia and her guests (most of which are little girls--though what 21 year old would invite little girls to her bridal shower?) slide down a big slide on mattresses. There's even an appearance by Raven, who has no real role in this movie but to sell movie tickets and soundtracks. Young girls, however, would probably love these scenes.It's also pretty jarring at first to see Mia suddenly all grown up and facing marriage. It was easier to relate to her in the first movie since then she was just an average teen who suddenly had to be a princess. Now she's a princess who suddenly has to be a queen. The story just lacks that element of surprise.With that said, there are some pretty good performances by Julie Andrews, Anne Hathaway, Hector Elizondo, and John Rhys-Davies as the villain (who does very well with his somewhat limited role). Unfortunately, a few of the best characters from the first movie (like Lilly and Mia's mother) are relegated to minor roles here. Lilly was an important character in the first film, so it was sad to see her just hanging out in the background, not having much to do with the story at all.Despite it's flaws, the movie has a good ending with a good message, and of course everyone lives happily ever after.

857946,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00063KGPU,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","The best thing about the original 'Princess Diaries' (which I didn't like very much, sorry) was its star Anne Hatherway.  Since then Anne Hatherway did several works (including one Charles Dickens film) but she was best remembered as the star of this Disney hit.  And not surprisingly, with 'Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement' she came back as 'Princess' Mia of Genovia again.The original's ugly duckling story is left behind in America very quickly, and the film soon sets up a traditional love story, or in other words, how Mia meets Mr. Right in the fictional country of Genovia where elegant and benign Queen Clarisse Renaldi (Julie Andrews, as the original) rules, gently listening to the people's words.  But there are some problems Mia must overcome before she becomes new queen.  For starters, there is a scheming aristocrat Viscount Mabrey (John Rhys Davies), and many ceremonies she must attend, duties and responsibilities she must be aware of.  But the most annoying thing is that the old laws of the country solemnly demand that she should be married within the limited period to be qualified as the new ruler.  As if the land of Genovia belongs to the 19th century.[ANNE HATHERWAY IS SO CHARMING] In spite of the corny situations and cardboard characters, Anne Hatherway's affable personality is unchanged in the sequel, and she spills her charms all over the screen which are simply irresitible.  She is more natural than in the original, at times even more down-to-earth (even though she is going to be queen), and no one can deny that she has the star quality.  Even though you hate the film itself, for being too Disney-esque.Most of the cast in the original come back.  Julie Andrews is as elegant as ever, and she is given some chances to be more comical.  You can also see Hector Elizondo as Joe, as loyally attached to the queen as before, and Heather Matarazzo as Mia's best friend Lilly, who is allowed to show more merry sides of the character.  Clearly Ms. Matarazzo, who tends to be typecast as 'ugly' girl (the idea which I firmly refuse to believe), is radiant, having fun being on the set, the same way as Anne Hatherway and Julie Andrews must be feeling.  And another merit is Chris Pine as 'Nicholas' (reference to 'Nicholas Nickleby'?) the new romance for Mia.  Though the story is nothing but predictable, there is enough chemistry bubbling between these two young stars, which convinces us of their romantic relations.Though it is amusing enough, the 2 hour film is too long for me, and sometimes I felt it was padded when the characters started to have some fun, and invites us to joiin in, like all royal pajama party.  In fact, the film itself is like watching someone's pajama party -- doing mattress ride on the stairs or singing karaoke songs, one sung by Raven with Julie Andrews.  Is this Disnely's unashamed promotion for the film's soundtrack CD, or just good clean fun?  Who knows?But as a whole the film is a good showcase for Anne Hatherway's delectable personality, and director Garry Marshall should be praised for inducing her to show her best sides, even if the story itself is far from original.After the success of the first 'Princess Diaries' Paramount Pictures made 'The Prince and I' and Warner Brothers 'What a Girl Wants.'  Always adoable Anne Hatherway represents these things in one person, and that's a pretty rare achievement.",3,Surely Predictable But Anne Hatherway Is Irresistible,1110585600,"03 12, 2005",2005,3392,"['best', 'thing', 'original', ""'Princess"", 'Diaries', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'very', 'much', 'sorry', 'was', 'star', 'Anne', 'Hatherway', 'then', 'Anne', 'Hatherway', 'did', 'several', 'works', 'including', 'one', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'film', 'was', 'best', 'remembered', 'star', 'Disney', 'hit', 'not', 'surprisingly', ""'Princess"", 'Diaries', '2', 'Royal', 'Engagement', 'came', 'back', ""'Princess"", 'Mia', 'Genovia', 'again.The', 'original', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'story', 'left', 'America', 'very', 'quickly', 'film', 'soon', 'up', 'traditional', 'love', 'story', 'other', 'words', 'how', 'Mia', 'Mr', 'Right', 'fictional', 'country', 'Genovia', 'where', 'elegant', 'benign', 'Queen', 'Clarisse', 'Renaldi', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'original', 'rules', 'gently', 'listening', 'people', 'words', 'are', 'problems', 'Mia', 'must', 'overcome', 'new', 'queen', 'starters', 'scheming', 'aristocrat', 'Viscount', 'Mabrey', 'John', 'Rhys', 'Davies', 'many', 'ceremonies', 'must', 'attend', 'duties', 'responsibilities', 'must', 'be', 'aware', 'most', 'annoying', 'thing', 'old', 'laws', 'country', 'solemnly', 'demand', 'should', 'be', 'married', 'limited', 'period', 'be', 'qualified', 'new', 'ruler', 'land', 'Genovia', 'belongs', '19th', 'century', 'ANNE', 'HATHERWAY', 'IS', 'SO', 'CHARMING', ']', 'spite', 'corny', 'situations', 'cardboard', 'characters', 'Anne', 'Hatherway', 'affable', 'personality', 'unchanged', 'sequel', 'charms', 'screen', 'are', 'simply', 'irresitible', 'more', 'natural', 'original', 'times', 'even', 'more', 'down-to-earth', 'even', 'going', 'be', 'queen', 'one', 'can', 'deny', 'star', 'quality', 'Even', 'hate', 'film', 'being', 'too', 'Disney-esque.Most', 'cast', 'original', 'come', 'back', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'as', 'elegant', 'ever', 'given', 'chances', 'be', 'more', 'comical', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'Joe', 'loyally', 'attached', 'queen', 'Heather', 'Matarazzo', 'Mia', 'best', 'friend', 'Lilly', 'who', 'allowed', 'show', 'more', 'merry', 'sides', 'character', 'Clearly', 'Ms.', 'Matarazzo', 'who', 'be', 'typecast', ""'ugly"", 'girl', 'idea', 'firmly', 'refuse', 'believe', 'radiant', 'having', 'fun', 'being', 'set', 'same', 'way', 'Anne', 'Hatherway', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'must', 'be', 'feeling', 'merit', 'Chris', 'Pine', ""'Nicholas"", 'reference', ""'Nicholas"", 'Nickleby', 'new', 'romance', 'Mia', 'story', 'nothing', 'predictable', 'enough', 'chemistry', 'bubbling', 'two', 'young', 'stars', 'romantic', 'relations.Though', 'amusing', 'enough', '2', 'hour', 'film', 'too', 'long', 'sometimes', 'felt', 'was', 'padded', 'when', 'characters', 'started', 'have', 'fun', 'joiin', 'royal', 'pajama', 'party', 'fact', 'film', 'watching', 'someone', 'pajama', 'party', 'doing', 'mattress', 'ride', 'stairs', 'singing', 'karaoke', 'songs', 'one', 'sung', 'Raven', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'Disnely', 'unashamed', 'promotion', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'CD', 'just', 'good', 'clean', 'fun', 'Who', 'whole', 'film', 'good', 'showcase', 'Anne', 'Hatherway', 'delectable', 'personality', 'director', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'should', 'be', 'praised', 'inducing', 'show', 'best', 'sides', 'even', 'story', 'far', 'original.After', 'success', 'first', 'Diaries', 'Paramount', 'Pictures', 'made', 'Prince', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'Girl', 'Wants', 'Always', 'adoable', 'Anne', 'Hatherway', 'things', 'one', 'person', 'pretty', 'rare', 'achievement']",N/A
