39471,AG0TA24LI0XV7,0780662911,"Baron Sardonicus, Super Genius","[4, 6]","This was better than I anticipated. It's worth a rental because the nostalgia alone is fun.There's good here and there's bad. When I first saw that a new cartoon video about the Charlie Brown comic strips was available, I expected something disappointing ... because in this day and age of kids' movies jammed with fast and furious catch phrases and dumb comedy, this could have been a disaster. But the movie as a whole was surprisingly respectful of the Peanuts legacy and its gentle humor (and happily, it was not in-your-face, stupid, or peppered with modern slang).The program should have been thirty minutes, not 45. Or, they should have chosen a meatier story and made an 80 minute film. Its running time feels somewhere in between a TV episode and a feature film.""Happiness is a Warm Blanket, Charlie Brown"" reminded me of the TV series ""The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show"" that used to air on Saturday mornings when I was a teen: little vignettes based on the comics. If you miss that show, give this DVD a try; it's very similar to that format. (Yes, the DVD blends into one long story, but for the most part the movie is episodic-- much like reading a bunch of Schulz's comic strips.)While the team that made this film were obviously reverent of the Schulz comic stories and characters, nothing can bring back the charm of his comedy or of the 1960's holiday specials and films. Seeing this movie created a desire in me to rewatch those classic programs and movies again, like these gems:Peanuts Double Feature: Snoopy Come Home and A Boy Named Charlie BrownPeanuts Holiday Collection (It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown / A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving / A Charlie Brown Christmas) (Deluxe Edition)He's Your Dog, Charlie Brown (Deluxe Edition)Race for Your Life, Charlie BrownBon Voyage, Charlie Brown, And Don't Come Back!I did find some things spot-on and nicely done in HIAWBCB: Snoopy's voice characterizations (the few that there were) sounded near perfect, Linus' voice was a very good choice, the backgrounds were simple and pleasant, and the pacing and timing were exactly as they should be. Also: the incidental music was fine, though nothing beats Guaraldi's sweet stuff.Anything that brings Peanuts to the attention of a new generation is good, and the fact that Schulz's family and others are striving to revive and rejuvenate his work is in itself a very good thing.During my life, Peanuts has brought me immeasurable laughter and countless hours of entertainment, via a safe and pleasant escape where eccentric characters have silly misadventures. Few things in the media come along and bring us so much pleasure, and that is just one reason why the gifted Charles M. Schulz's funny pictures and sweet wisdom are important to the people of the world. He gave us so much to enjoy, and merely through ink and paper. That's not just talent.

This blu ray looks/sounds great, interesting special features and stays true to the strip. Keeping in tradition with the older specials the music is jazzy, the drawings are old-school and still uses children for voice actors. The only bad thing, is the pacing seems a bit slow. and at times it seems like they are trying to fill each second with a gag from the strips that they sometimes makes the storytelling a bit uneven. But, overall, a great collection of classic jokes and characters. It is sad Charles Shultz passed away, and he is definitely missed during this movie. While the story is taken directly from his classic strips, back in the day Schulz would come up with new material to fill in the gaps or to bridge the main story with the side-gags. One can not rate this along with the christmas special or any of the three main holiday classics, as those cartoons are so iconic and part of the american fabric, that nothing today could ever compare to them. Peanuts is a family tradition, always has been, and will probably not being a part of our culture. But, this is a great little show in its own right. And those who try to compare the innocence and charm of the original strip with cartoons of today are morons. Even Seth Mcfarland has a respect for Ol' Charlie Brown and the gang. Todays cartoons are too snarky and crude, and at times raunchy. Peanuts have always been funny, but not in an overly cynical way. The writing is clever and the jokes/charm are in every single panel. It's hard to read a Peanuts strip and not smile. This type of humor and writing is missing in today's world. Everyone is always trying to be too vulgar, always trying to get noticed with profanity or suggestive innuendo. It's great to see that the great American traditions are still as powerful today as they were in the 50s and 60s. And Charlie Brown and his friends are a testament to how much people love storytelling that is real, and clever. There are no fart jokes, no off-color politically incorrect jokes, no making fun of the handicapped, no racist or sexists jokes, just good ol' fashioned fun and clever word play. I love Peanuts, and wish they would redo all the old shows onto blu ray. I thought they'd do that with the sets that go in chronological order, but they haven't yet. While I do love the fact that this movie is made from classic strips and I look forward to more like this in the future. I can't help but hope the older stuff gets a decent blu ray treatment. This movie is very charming and sweet, and worth every penny. Anyone who likes great humor and old-school values will love this movie, even if you are a small child or a grown up you will love what this movie has to offer. It has a longer run time than the older cartoons. But it's not overdone, just paced a little slow in parts. The amount of material wasn't the issue though it was simply the pacing. But, overall it was done with love.

She's a new fan, but she already loves the gang. I didn't know what WARM BLANKET was going to be about... we just dropped it in and hit play.What's immediately obvious is that the production is lovingly put together; Striving to emulate the look and feel of 60's era PEANUTS. I really like that. I also like that the effort is made to create a full story, versus some of the story-less vignettes of recent years which are so disappointing.What I didn't expect, however, is for WARM BLANKET to be so dark. Throughout, Linus is essentially bullied by Lucy and others to part with his trademark blanket. He's near-tortured by the constant threat of loss. (Add to that the relentless bit where Charlie Brown reflects on all of his external pressures!) It gets pretty real. Like Linus, my daughter is blankie-dependent, so she took all of the teasing and desperation to heart. I had to re-assure her that Linus would probably get it back in the end. That made her happy.Bullying is a pretty hot topic on TV and the internet. But the end theme of these scenarios is how bullying is wrong, or whatever. Whereas here in WARM BLANKET, it's more about validating dependence as a way to get through the day. I'm not opposed to the message, but I know some wise-guy is going to re-dub the footage for youTube. When Charlie Brown sits by Linus' bedside through the night, helping him cope with withdrawal, the cynic in me feels it could easily be heroin Linus is jonesing for. It's not a huge leap.The story is choppy at times with some non-sequiturs. And Lucy delivers the same punch line twice, ""I'll never get married,"" which falls pretty flat. But I completely support the overall effort. I would love to see more specials in this vein. It felt focused and deliberate and genuine. For instance, I like how they didn't feel obligated to drag out every character... there's no Peppermint Patty anywhere. And Woodstock is barely seen. Let's save them for another story.Lastly, you could play a drinking game based on whenever someone calls something ""stupid."" It's used throughout and liberally.

I'm very excited about this, as I am a longtime Peanuts fan. I had read about this story in the comic strip, but this is the first time it's been animated. It should be interesting to see how the animation turns out, as Bill Melendez is no longer with us. But Craig Schulz, Charles' son, and Stephan Pastis, of Pearls Before Swine fame, are at the helm, so it should be good. They did a lot of work on the Peanuts Motion Comics, which I really enjoyed, so I'm anticipating this release. I won't repeat anything from the first post here, as I believe that pretty much sums it up for the features, but I do believe it will be worth the wait. Even though it's only one special this time around, I'm grateful for it, and I hope to see more in the future. I highly recommend this release.Update 7/9/13: I just came across the review and realized I forgot to update! Anyway, I loved it. It met my expectations. Even though the animation was updated, the story remained the same. And, it was actual animation, not Flash Player. Craig has done his father proud. I do hope to see another special sometime.

Happiness Is a Warm Blanket, Charlie Brown is a great new special for those who love Peanuts specials or those who love wholesome family entertainment. While, admittedly, nothing can capture the magic and pure simplicity of the original specials (from the 60's and early 70's) this new special comes awfully close and comes highly recommended.The story:Linus learns his Grandma is coming to visit and plans to rid him of his blue security blanket. As her visit draws closer Lucy and the rest of the Peanuts gang try to help Linus learn to cope without his blanket.  Lucy attempts to use her psychiatric service and good old Charlie Brown tries to help in his own way but can't stand to see his best friend Linus suffer. While all this is going on our favorite beagle has motives to obtain the blanket for himself. In the end Linus realizes that everyone has their own ""security blanket"" and isn't a little security is a good thing?A great story based on a Charlz Schultz original.The Specifications:Anamorphic Widescreen (1:78:1 Aspect Ratio). English Dolby Digital 5.1 sound or Spanish StereoThe Special Features:Deconstucting Schulz: From Comic Strips to Screenplay - How the Peanuts comic strip was made into a specialHappiness is...Finding the Right Voice - Meet the stellar new voice cast (Peanuts Specials, for those who may not know, have always employed children actors for the voices).24 Frames Per Second - Drawing and Animating a Peanuts SpecialDeleted Scene with an Introduction by Director Andy BeallI'm very pleased with the amount of special features to be found on this release. For those not normally so excited about buying a release with only one Peanuts special, this one being 46mins and including so many special features certainly makes it worthwhile. Not only is there a lot of content, the bonus features are actually interesting and very relevant to this release. If they could just start producing this much bonus material for the classic specials being released, though I know they do try, but this is the best they've done yet.So there is a new Peanuts special to enjoy for those of us who have worn out the ones already available. If it doesn't quite completely recapture the magic of those originals (honestly what could) it certainly serves up a nice warm helping of Charlie Brown happiness. The Peanuts specials are like a security blanket for those of us who grew up on them, this special adds a worthy patch to that quilt. 5 stars for the special itself and 5 stars for this DVD and the amount of material you're getting as a purchaser.PS I Love the artwork on this release and for anyone interested in owning other Peanuts specials new to DVD there is another recommended release coming out,Happiness Is...

Jurosik,"[65, 68]","Here are a few important things to know about Happiness is a Warm Blanket, Charlie Brown:* There are no pop culture references or cheery pop songs.  The music isn't rehashed or remixed Vince Guaraldi tunes -- it's warm, reminiscent and composed by Mark Mothersbaugh of DEVO fame.* The Peanuts gang has not been ""rebooted,"" ""rebranded,"" or remodeled in 3D CGI.  The hand-drawn characters are a seemingly clever blend of Schultz's originals and Melendez's specials.  The camera moves are subtle, with a few clever twists that seem perfectly fit into the narrative (including a Snoopy vulture point-of-view).* The Peanuts do not fight social ills, or attempt to grow an organic garden or welcome a strange newcomer to town.  There are no self-congratulatory messages about the kids being ""special"" or needing to build their ""self-esteem.""  (Not that any of these things are wrong in their own right, but the messages in the film, as in Schultz's strip, are subtle, gentle and belong to the viewer, not the creators)* The film is an absolute pleasure to anyone who values Schultz's work, the Melendez specials, and/or their childhood from the 1960s through 1970s.  And the really cool thing: hip preschoolers dig it too (at least mine did).For the life of me, I cannot figure out how Warners let this get made.  It's counter-intuitive to every decision entertainment executives have made in the last twenty years regarding children's entertainment.  They most have lost a bet, or taken a dare, or something.

MY point here is that to say that this is a poor Charlie Brown special, one should probably go back a few years and see some of the ones that were zero percent fun at all.THIS time around, all of the new characters seem to have dissapeared. In fact, it is virtually 1965 all over again, not even a Woodstock or a Peppermint Patty in sight. What I liked about this special is that it reveisits alot of older gags that had been forgotten during the eighties dreck of a TV show... and reintroduces them to a younger audience (ala my son.) Also, I felt that it was a good show for my son to see, who virtually IS LINUS, and has no ambition to ever let go of his blanket.
