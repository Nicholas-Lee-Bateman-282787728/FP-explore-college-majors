I was pleasently surprised to experience a series of claymation stories which were truly unique. Mr. Elliot is a talented artist with a fresh perspective on storytelling. Most of the material included here is (or appears to be) based on Elliot's actual family and experiences growning up in Melbourne. The stories are often subtle in their humour and message, but evoke strong laughs and somber contemplation. These stories are quirky yet very human. My only complaint is that I was left wanting more. The price seems a bit steep for the amount of content.",4,Understated and touching,1110758400,"03 14, 2005",2005,673,"['was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'DVD', 'only', 'knew', 'was', 'Australian', 'had', 'recieved', 'good', 'reviews', 'here', 'was', 'pleasently', 'surprised', 'experience', 'series', 'claymation', 'stories', 'were', 'truly', 'unique', 'Mr.', 'Elliot', 'talented', 'artist', 'fresh', 'perspective', 'storytelling', 'Most', 'material', 'included', 'here', 'be', 'based', 'Elliot', 'actual', 'family', 'experiences', 'growning', 'up', 'Melbourne', 'stories', 'are', 'often', 'subtle', 'humour', 'message', 'evoke', 'strong', 'laughs', 'somber', 'contemplation', 'stories', 'are', 'quirky', 'yet', 'very', 'human', 'only', 'complaint', 'was', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'price', 'bit', 'steep', 'amount', 'content']",N/A

Harvie Krumpet won the Academy Award for Animated Short Film in 2003 and it's worth the 22 minutes to watch if you enjoy claymation of a different sort.The story is the life of a simple-minded Polish man who emigrates to Australia and his many comical misfortunes, all narrated in a wonderful deadpan by fellow Aussie Geoffrey Rush. Harvie's a few eggs short of a picnic basket, if you know what I mean. But despite his severely diminished mental capacity (or because of it), he remains cheerful and happy-go-lucky (mostly).The humor is dark, adult-oriented, and bizarre, interrupted periodically by ""FAKT"" cards of dubious factual accuracy. It's weird humor and highly recommended for those who enjoy it.",5,Wonderfully demented black comedy,1284422400,"09 14, 2010",2010,886,"['Harvie', 'Krumpet', 'wonderfully', 'weird', 'animated', 'short', 'Australian', 'director', 'Adam', 'Elliot', 'who', 'later', 'went', 'make', 'equally', 'weird', 'feature-length', 'animationMary', 'Max', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Harvie', 'Krumpet', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Animated', 'Short', 'Film', '2003', '22', 'minutes', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'claymation', 'different', 'sort.The', 'story', 'life', 'simple-minded', 'Polish', 'man', 'who', 'Australia', 'many', 'comical', 'misfortunes', 'narrated', 'wonderful', 'deadpan', 'fellow', 'Aussie', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Harvie', 'few', 'eggs', 'short', 'picnic', 'basket', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'severely', 'diminished', 'mental', 'capacity', 'cheerful', 'happy-go-lucky', 'mostly', '.The', 'humor', 'dark', 'adult-oriented', 'bizarre', 'interrupted', 'periodically', 'FAKT', 'cards', 'dubious', 'factual', 'accuracy', 'weird', 'humor', 'highly', 'recommended', 'who', 'enjoy']",N/A

836299,AUTBHG6070SL4,B0002IQLU8,"wiredweird ""wiredweird""","[0, 0]","This amazing animation appeals to me in more ways than I think I can say. There's Harvie, of course, the misfortune magnet who somehow keeps plugging along despite it all. The narrative style announces each new disaster with head-on bluntness and total lack of emotion, much the way Harvie himself deals with them. Instead of morose, however, this comes across as reserved and accepting, a lesson in living through the tough moments. That casual tolerance of of the worst life has to offer makes it seem not so bad after all.Then there's the goofy animation style, Harvie's penchant for undress (no matter what the local standards), and a never-ending stream of minor jokes and throw-aways. (Watch for a finger-puppet anywhere but on a finger.) The rough animation style seems to glory in slightly lumpy lines, reminding the viewer that we real people have our own bumps and blemishes, but get by quite nicely anyway.Even with the extras, this isn't a long DVD. Maybe brevity is a virtue this time. That will make it easier to schedule seeing this one again and again, as I'm sure I will. I know I haven't done it justice, but I'm not sure words can.
