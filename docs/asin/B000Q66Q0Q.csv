As I'm getting a bit hard of hearing and the British accents were a bit thick, I followed very little of the story. It might have been great, but other than the vaguest outlines of the birth, life and death of Purcell and the events of his era, with which I was somewhat acquainted, I didn't know what was going on. It may well have deserved more than two stars, but I couldn't tell. Closed captions or subtitles should be standard.

1073536,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B000Q66Q0Q,C. B Collins Jr.,"[0, 1]","Whereas the music in this over long film is outstanding, the movie itself has many problems. The strategy by which the narrative unfolds is to flash back and forth between actors playing the roles of the court of Charles II to scenes in which the actor is suppose to be the historic character in actual historic locations. It makes the film over-long. Because so little is actually known about the life of Henry Purcell, the film focuses on the lives of the monarchs he served, Charles II, James II, William and Mary. The events that take place during the reigns of Charles, James, William and Mary rush by and for someone not familiar with these events, the film would surely be confusing. Most odd to me was the way Mary II and her husband William of Orange are portrayed. She is portrayed as a silly giggle-box and he is portrayed as retarded. This distortion was unnecessary and added nothing to the plot or historical accuracy of the film. I also fault Simon Callow, the actor who plays Charles II, for outlandish overacting and over exaggerations of every syllable he spoke. His emotional flair imposed on every word that came out of his mouth makes his lines incomprehensible and eventually irrelevant and tiresome. However in Callow's defense, every actor is pushed to overact. Michael Ball never gives us enough insight to really understand the character of Purcell. The beautiful actress Nina Young plays the wife of Purcell, perpetually in mourning for the death of another baby. The series where Rufus Sewell plays Charles II is fantastic and is highly recommended if a comprehensible summary of the reign of Charles II is desired by a viewer. This film is just not well constructed. That being said, the musical direction of John Eliot Gardiner is top rate. The choir that sings much of the soundtrack is perfect. The soloist, Nancy Argenta, has a voice that will break your heart as she performs some of Purcell's arias.",3,This over-acted over-long film gets 3 stars for the soundtrack,1302739200,"04 14, 2011",2011,1934,"['music', 'long', 'film', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'many', 'problems', 'strategy', 'narrative', 'unfolds', 'flash', 'back', 'forth', 'actors', 'playing', 'roles', 'court', 'Charles', 'II', 'scenes', 'actor', 'suppose', 'be', 'historic', 'character', 'actual', 'historic', 'locations', 'film', 'over-long', 'so', 'little', 'actually', 'known', 'life', 'Henry', 'Purcell', 'film', 'lives', 'monarchs', 'served', 'Charles', 'II', 'James', 'II', 'William', 'Mary', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'reigns', 'Charles', 'James', 'William', 'Mary', 'rush', 'someone', 'not', 'familiar', 'events', 'film', 'would', 'surely', 'be', 'confusing', 'Most', 'odd', 'was', 'way', 'Mary', 'II', 'husband', 'William', 'Orange', 'are', 'portrayed', 'portrayed', 'silly', 'giggle-box', 'portrayed', 'retarded', 'distortion', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'added', 'nothing', 'plot', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'film', 'also', 'fault', 'Simon', 'Callow', 'actor', 'who', 'Charles', 'II', 'outlandish', 'overacting', 'exaggerations', 'syllable', 'spoke', 'emotional', 'flair', 'imposed', 'word', 'came', 'mouth', 'lines', 'incomprehensible', 'eventually', 'irrelevant', 'tiresome', 'However', 'Callow', 'defense', 'actor', 'pushed', 'overact', 'Michael', 'Ball', 'never', 'enough', 'insight', 'really', 'understand', 'character', 'Purcell', 'beautiful', 'actress', 'Nina', 'Young', 'wife', 'Purcell', 'perpetually', 'mourning', 'death', 'baby', 'series', 'where', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'Charles', 'II', 'fantastic', 'highly', 'recommended', 'comprehensible', 'summary', 'reign', 'Charles', 'II', 'desired', 'viewer', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'well', 'constructed', 'being', 'said', 'musical', 'direction', 'John', 'Eliot', 'Gardiner', 'top', 'rate', 'choir', 'much', 'soundtrack', 'perfect', 'soloist', 'Nancy', 'Argenta', 'voice', 'will', 'break', 'heart', 'Purcell', 'arias']","England, My England - The Story of Henry Purcell"

So why not just do the film in the context of Purcell's time and keep it there? The switching to the 1960's is annoying and not needed. A TV version, which I taped some time ago, had edited out all of the 1960's angst. So when I got the CD I was very disappointed with these 1960's interruptions. At the time, the description of the CD was lacking this important fact! So I still use the old TV taped version when I want to see this film. You've heard of the ""who dun it"" type of film?

So it is not surprising that he would produce a film about Henry Purcell(1659-1695).  Sometimes, rambling, but always fascinating; part biography of Purcell and part actors putting on a play about Purcell in modern day England.Not much is known about the historical Purcell, whose music (in great abundance) nonetheless survives today as one of the great glories of the Restoration.  Henry Purcell IS a mystery.  We know where he's buried (next to Vaughan Williams in Westminster Abbey), but that's about it.  No one knows for certain where he was born or even precisely when he was born.  He lived exactly the same number of years as Mozart - only thirty-five- but we only know in detail what he did for three of those years.  Page after page of some of his manuscripts of some of his masterworks are completely blank.  Purcell was, and is, a mystery, except that we know he wrote over a thousand works, at least one for every working week of his life.However, the film dances very neatly around the paucity of information by bouncing back and forth between Purcell's time and early Mid-60's England, a time of cultural and political upheaval.The music played during this film was NEWLY DESIGNED for the action at the time.  None of the music is from pre-existing recordings, and that fact makes this DVD doubly interesting to me.  Thus you have music in period style played on period instruments, although with some give-and-take on questions of authenticity such as whether Purcell meant to use drums or not use drums in Queen Mary's Funeral Music; some authorities say yes, some say no, and I don't really care because it's not all that important. Suffice it to say that John Eliot Gardiner was closely involved with the selection of music repertory for the film, and although it does not always include Purcell's greatest hits, it does show the breadth of his achievements and the way he responded to the events of the late 17th century.This is simply wonderful to behold on any number of levels: the Restoration Period is recreated with loving detail, with sumptuous costumes and production design, and Purcell's music is breathtakingly performed, conducted by John Eliot Gardiner and sung by his skilled Monteverdi Singers.  The performance by Simon Callow, Corin Redgrave and a host of fantastic actors, some solo singers such as Michael Chance and James Bowman, are all uniformly excellent.GRAMOPHONE, NOV. 2007: ""An imaginative matching of history, ideas, the man and his music"".THE AUSTRALIAN: ""Looks and sounds like a masterpiece - wonderful to hear as it is to behold.

But seeing it again turned out somewhat of a disappointment. Maybe BBC viewers have been spoiled by too much very well made historical drama to be particularly impressed by this film. The recent series on Charles II (starring the charismatic Rufus Sewell) was extremely powerful and by comparison makes the merry monarch look like a pretty pale figure here. The present film's greatest problem is caused by the lack of information regarding Purcell's life, which the screenwriters have tried to solve by creating a frame story of a 1960's troop of actors doing a play on Charles II, and one of them writing another one on Purcell. So we jump to and fro between the 1600s and the 1960s in a confusion of characters and events. It takes too long before you get an idea who is who, and the tale of the British succession and its historical context is told in such a patchy way that I cannot imagine it will make sense to somebody not already familiar with it. The Monmouth rebellion, Monmouth's death and James II's succession rush by in something like a minute or so. Queen Mary is shown as a giggling nincompoop, and her husband William as a complete imbecile. All characters are stereotyped like that. There is not a single one, least of all Purcell himself, with whom we spend enough time to develop something of a bond or a deeper interest. Worse, the 1960s episodes get increasingly heavy-handed, suggesting historical parallels with the time of Charles, James, and William and Mary. Actual footage of, for instance, an anti-Vietnam demonstration, is interspersed. Simon Callow as the playwright character throws tormented looks at the camera while declaiming convoluted, often toe-curling existential truths (and keeping up a love life quite as active as Charles's). It's all a bit too much - lengthwise too, eventually. A more concentrated story of three quarters of an hour less duration than the present 153 minutes might have been a better idea.The costumes are well done, the sets less so. One recognizes some obviously eastern European exteriors. And there is no way a set designer can get away with three burning flat cardboard faades to represent the great fire of London - not before a CGI saturated audience anyway. Also, one wishes that for once a crew in search of an impressive baroque interior would think of something else than Wilton's Double Cube Room. The music, however, remains splendid as always, and it is through the music that some scenes become touching after all.The video quality appeared to me rather dark, with somewhat washed out colours.

Otherwise it's right on target in many ways that are important.  I recently read The Diary of John Evelyn (a contemporary of Samuel Pepys) as well as some other books about well known figures from the 1600's in England.  I noticed some dialog in the movie that came straight from John Evelyn's Diary.  That was amusing, however the quote I'm thinking of is unprintable in an Amazon review, so I can't type it here, but I knew immediately what the source was when I heard it.  A lot of important things happened in Purcell's life (plague, the Great Fire of London), and many of those changes are noted in the movie.  We may not know a lot of biographical information about Henry Purcell, but this mini-history gives a pretty good outline of what was going on in his time.
