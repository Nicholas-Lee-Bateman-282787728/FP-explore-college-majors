788102,A33L7G4E8CID3,B0000WN15E,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[71, 74]","Dilbert never got a fair chance on TV, being cancelled on a third rate network whose idea of great comedy usually involves bodily functions or broad you-go-girl bland tripe. For my part, I thought that this show happened to be one of the funniest sitcoms ever, and it stands along with the Simpsons as being one of the wryest and most perceptive satirical works on American Television.The voice acting is excellent. The characters all sound just as they would be expected to when reading the comic strip. Daniel Stern as Dilbert, Larry Miller as the clueless boss (who had to have been based off of one of Scott Adams' bosses), Larry Charles as slacker engineer Wally, Kathy Griffin as Alice, the triangular-haired female engineer, and Chris Elliot as Dilbert's sidekick Dogbert, not to mention a parade of guest stars, including Tom Green, Andy Dick, Jerry Seinfeld, and Jason Alexander. Put simply, this show had talent to burn.After occasional reruns on Comedy Central, I am jubliant to see this comedy jewel now available on DVD. The quirkiness and humor of the comic strip is definitely present here, as well as the savage skewering of workplace politics and procedures. The show's highlights include the first episode, the anthrax cough drops bit was inspired, a Y2K-themed episode (remember all that fuss about the end of the world?), frequent visits from evil Mr. Catbert (voiced by Jason Alexander), as well as a guest appearance by Jerry Seinfeld as an insane computer in charge of a computer-by-mail company, a la Dell. My favorite episode has got to be the merger episode, which has Dilbert's company merging with aliens from outer space (the funniest bit had to do with a mexican restaurant/corporate pickup bar).I think very highly of this show and think that you should give it a shot.

Those episodes are the main reason I bought the DVD set.  However, the series went downhill in the second half or so.The comic strip never translated well to a television show.  I thought the character voices were well chosen though.  Jason Alexander as Catbert was classic.  The stories, however, just didn't hold up.There were a couple of episodes that were outright slams against God and religion which I don't care for.  The story of Todd (God) and the Wally story which was a slam against Jesus and the Last Supper were in extremely poor taste.  Make an episode slamming Mohammed, Allah and Muslims in general - watch the riots begin.The 'Dilbert gets pregnant' episode looked so stupid from its previews that I did not watch it on television.  To this day, I have not watched it on DVD.  Yes, I have not watched it to completely judge it.

He's the bespectacled potato-shaped Everyman, the alter ego of office workers frustrated by annoying coworkers and idiot bosses. The deliciously surreal tone of Scott Adams' comic strip is preserved (even amplified in places) in the TV adaptation.In the strange adventures of Dilbert (Daniel Stern) and friends... er, coworkers, they travel to the muddy, backward country of Elbonia, search for Dilbert's long-lost dad in the mall, create anthrax throat drops (&quot;My throat is moist... and the raspiness is gone... GACK!&quot;), try to name a product that doesn't exist, deal with a black hole, and battle tiny people who are stealing the office supplies. Their souls are sucked out by their company, and a cat rules over Human Resources. And through it all, the megalomaniac Dogbert (Chris Elliot) somehow manages to arrange things so that the disasters aren't too outstanding.Several supporting characters have enlarged roles. There's the violent, big-haired Alice (Kathy Griffin); lazy Wally; naive, dumb Asok, the idiot pointy-haired boss (Larry Miller), and Loud Howard (who can shatter glass with his booming voice). Other favorites like Catbert (played by &quot;Seinfeld's&quot; Jason Alexander) crop up from time to time, as well as other cameos by Jerry Seinfeld, Jeri Ryan, and others.The animation is amusing and quite faithful to Adams' original animation (although Dilbert has a mouth here). And the humor is deliciously, delightfully twisted -- without losing the corporate edge, the scriptwriters kept in the sort of bizarre occurrances that make this so funny. Several scenarios are, however, included from the strip -- and sometimes even expanded (such as the Dadbert-in-the-mall episode).Everyone's favorite bespectacled, pointy-tied, potato-shaped engineer is still funny on the small screen. &quot;Dilbert: The Complete Series&quot; is a must-have for cubicle serfs and technogeeks.",5,A geek dream come true,1077408000,"02 22, 2004",2004,1966,"['Dilbert', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'least', 'know', 'bespectacled', 'potato-shaped', 'Everyman', 'alter', 'ego', 'office', 'workers', 'frustrated', 'annoying', 'coworkers', 'idiot', 'bosses', 'deliciously', 'surreal', 'tone', 'Scott', 'Adams', 'comic', 'strip', 'preserved', 'even', 'amplified', 'places', 'TV', 'strange', 'adventures', 'Dilbert', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'friends', 'er', 'coworkers', 'travel', 'muddy', 'backward', 'country', 'Elbonia', 'search', 'Dilbert', 'long-lost', 'dad', 'mall', 'create', 'anthrax', 'throat', 'drops', 'quot', 'throat', 'moist', 'raspiness', 'gone', 'GACK', 'quot', 'try', 'name', 'product', ""n't"", 'exist', 'deal', 'black', 'hole', 'battle', 'tiny', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'stealing', 'office', 'supplies', 'souls', 'are', 'sucked', 'out', 'company', 'cat', 'rules', 'Human', 'Resources', 'megalomaniac', 'Dogbert', 'Chris', 'Elliot', 'somehow', 'arrange', 'things', 'so', 'disasters', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'outstanding.Several', 'supporting', 'characters', 'have', 'enlarged', 'roles', 'violent', 'big-haired', 'Alice', 'Kathy', 'Griffin', 'Wally', 'naive', 'dumb', 'Asok', 'idiot', 'pointy-haired', 'boss', 'Larry', 'Miller', 'Loud', 'Howard', 'who', 'can', 'shatter', 'glass', 'booming', 'voice', 'Other', 'favorites', 'Catbert', 'played', 'quot', 'Seinfeld', 'quot', 'Jason', 'Alexander', 'crop', 'time', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'cameos', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'Jeri', 'Ryan', 'others.The', 'animation', 'amusing', 'quite', 'faithful', 'Adams', 'original', 'animation', 'Dilbert', 'mouth', 'here', 'humor', 'deliciously', 'delightfully', 'twisted', 'losing', 'corporate', 'edge', 'scriptwriters', 'kept', 'sort', 'bizarre', 'occurrances', 'make', 'so', 'funny', 'Several', 'scenarios', 'are', 'however', 'included', 'strip', 'sometimes', 'even', 'expanded', 'such', 'Dadbert-in-the-mall', 'episode', '.Everyone', 'favorite', 'bespectacled', 'pointy-tied', 'potato-shaped', 'engineer', 'still', 'funny', 'small', 'screen', 'quot', 'Dilbert', 'Complete', 'Series', 'quot', 'must-have', 'cubicle', 'serfs', 'technogeeks']",Dilbert - The Complete Series

I suppose this only makes us appreciate the ones that got made even more like the priceless gems that they are.  Every episode here is quality and some of them still give me stitches after repeated viewing.  This set comes very nicely packaged in a digipak cardboard that opens up to reveal the 4 discs that fold up to slide into a nice outer sleeve.  The picture and sound quality are both very good as well although a Dolby 5.1 surround sound option would have been nice. The bonus features include a ""Making Dilbert Work"" documentary plus interviews with creator, Scott Adams which is a nice touch.  Having been in the corporate world for many years and subject to similar idiot bosses and situations makes me truly relate to and love this entire series.  I note that another reviewer found this dvd not funny and I suppose unless you've been in the corporate world many of the situations presented here would need some explaining.

The humor is so subtle and has such a nerd niche that it's easy to miss. One of my favorite episodes had to be the one where the company HMO doubled as an Italian Restaurant. Dilbert complains about the service and asks to see a real doctor, to which the waiter responds ""I'm sorry but your insurance doesn't cover that."" The pointy-haired boss recommends the ""Prostate Exam Marsala."" I thought this whole episode was a great riff on healthcare issues. There's another great bit where the guys in the marketing department attempt to market a product without knowing what the product is. Dilbert tries to protest but they simply explain that he doesn't understand the intricacies of marketing, because he seems to think that facts and information matter. But the marketing boys are confident that they can sell anyone any product without even knowing what the product is. It's a great riff on how vapid the world of advertising can be.
