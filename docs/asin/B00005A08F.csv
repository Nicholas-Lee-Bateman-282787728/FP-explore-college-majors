Trunks and the rest try to stop him but fails and cell becomes complete, making him more powerful than both Trunks and vageta.if you have been collectign the DVDs then this is a must have on your collection",4,the perfect cell,1041120000,"12 29, 2002",2002,514,"['tittle', 'might', 'suggest', 'Cell', 'perfection', 'everyone', 'surprise', 'Vageta', 'who', 'had', 'power', 'defeat', 'cell', 'decided', 'cell', 'imperfect', 'form', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'challenge', 'realizing', 'cell', 'used', 'vageta', 'hunger', 'power', 'trickign', 'letting', 'obsorb', 'android', '18', 'Trunks', 'rest', 'try', 'stop', 'fails', 'cell', 'becomes', 'complete', 'making', 'more', 'powerful', 'Trunks', 'vageta.if', 'have', 'been', 'collectign', 'DVDs', 'then', 'must', 'have', 'collection']",N/A

Vegeta let Cell search for Android 18 to reach his perfect form. What a dumbass do ya think? Trunks tries to step in but eventually, Vegeta stop that. By the way, do you think Krillin, who had the remote to shut down the androids and smashing it because he has a crush on her was bright? I doubt the possibility. Anyways, Krillin, a battered up Android 16 and Android 18 try to prevent the inevitable, but fail miserably. Cell has finally reached perfection and Vegeta gets his wish. How was this possible? Cell went up to the sun and used the Solar Flare Technique which was a good plan. Krillin was trying to stop Cell from sucking up 18, but he was no match for the powerful android from the future. In the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, Gohan finally reached the level of Super Saiyan, after letting all of his pain and anger inside of him. After Cell becomes perfect, Krillin takes a first shot with his Destructo Disk attack, but he was eventually felled be Cell when he sent Krillin sailing through a rock mountain. After that Vegeta and Cell finally face off. With SS2 Vegeta and Cell in his perfect form colliding, it looks like Vegeta still holds the advantage. But when Vegeta puts all of his power in one kick, Cell didn't even flinch. What does it mean? Has Vegeta, the egotistical saiyan prince, thirst for a challenge blown up in his face? Will Goku and Gohan make it out in time to lend them a hand? Stay tuned to find that out!!",4,Vegeta's Foolish Ambition,1055462400,"06 13, 2003",2003,1554,"['Cell', 'was', 'almost', 'begging', 'mercy', 'lured', 'Vegeta', 'foolish', 'decision', 'could', 'cause', 'everyone', 'lives', 'Vegeta', 'let', 'Cell', 'search', 'Android', '18', 'reach', 'perfect', 'form', 'What', 'dumbass', 'do', 'ya', 'think', 'Trunks', 'step', 'eventually', 'Vegeta', 'stop', 'way', 'do', 'think', 'Krillin', 'who', 'had', 'remote', 'shut', 'down', 'androids', 'smashing', 'crush', 'was', 'bright', 'doubt', 'possibility', 'Anyways', 'Krillin', 'battered', 'up', 'Android', '16', 'Android', '18', 'try', 'prevent', 'inevitable', 'fail', 'miserably', 'Cell', 'finally', 'reached', 'perfection', 'Vegeta', 'wish', 'How', 'was', 'possible', 'Cell', 'went', 'up', 'sun', 'used', 'Solar', 'Flare', 'Technique', 'was', 'good', 'plan', 'Krillin', 'was', 'trying', 'stop', 'Cell', 'sucking', 'up', '18', 'was', 'match', 'powerful', 'android', 'future', 'Hyperbolic', 'Time', 'Chamber', 'Gohan', 'finally', 'reached', 'level', 'Super', 'Saiyan', 'letting', 'pain', 'anger', 'Cell', 'becomes', 'perfect', 'Krillin', 'first', 'shot', 'Destructo', 'Disk', 'attack', 'was', 'eventually', 'felled', 'be', 'Cell', 'when', 'sent', 'Krillin', 'sailing', 'rock', 'mountain', 'Vegeta', 'Cell', 'finally', 'face', 'off', 'SS2', 'Vegeta', 'Cell', 'perfect', 'form', 'colliding', 'Vegeta', 'still', 'advantage', 'when', 'Vegeta', 'power', 'one', 'kick', 'Cell', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'flinch', 'What', 'mean', 'Has', 'Vegeta', 'egotistical', 'saiyan', 'prince', 'thirst', 'challenge', 'blown', 'up', 'face', 'Will', 'Goku', 'Gohan', 'make', 'out', 'time', 'lend', 'hand', 'Stay', 'tuned', 'find', 'out']",N/A
