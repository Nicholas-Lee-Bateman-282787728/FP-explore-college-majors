I must say that the last few episodes about Iran have been ""over the top"" as far as intrigue, split second timing, taut gripping suspense, blood and violence.  It's a bit too much, I must admit.  The writers have overdone it as far as blood and violence, and I have to hit the mute button and walk away from the screen when it becomes too much to take.  But, that said, there is nothing like it here in the US, and I bet that the intelligence services of this country and all the others are sometimes as clueless as they are portrayed.

1185848,A22ZVE83UJ6YGT,B001EHF3RS,Jack  Levic,"[3, 3]","Season 5 of MI-5 ended with such a bang that I couldn't wait for Season 6 to begin and to get a better explanation of what happened after Ros and Adam survived the Thames Barrier incident. When I started watching Season 6, I thought I had the wrong disk. Ros and Adam are quickly onto a new adventure and there is a brief comment about getting through the latest escapade and then ""talking about how we got here."" You'll see where they are when the show starts. The Thames Barrier incident is never mentioned again even though I expected there would be more closure to that story.Instead, Season 6 really takes a turn from the normal story. The whole season is basically one ongoing story with lots of side stories. My favorite character Ruth Evershed, played by Nicola Walker, is gone this season and apparently with no explanation. The lovely Gemma Jones joins the cast as Connie James. It's great to see an older actress joining the cast of mainly young actors. The MI-5 cast is a fine group of actors and this makes the show even more special. Alex Lanipekun also joins the cast as a young and dedicated journalist named Ben Kaplan who begins uncovering secrets that neither the Iranian nor the British spies want him to discover. He is a great addition to the cast--a normal, honest guy who unintentionally gets wrapped up in the world of espionage.This season it is the Iranians who are up to no good yet it is the MI-5 that is responsible for a major disaster in Tehran. Even the ""good"" guys get it wrong and make disastrous decisions. Although Iran and the UK are preparing for a peace agreement, it is becoming clear that Iran is getting the one component it needs to be able to create a nuclear bomb.Here is where MI-5 must save the UK and the world from an Iranian nuclear bomb. New characters are introduced in the form of the Iranian diplomat and his wife. No one can be believed or trusted. Everyone has his or her own plan of action.Harry Pearce has no fondness for his American counterparts and it becomes clearer in Season 6 and both the Americans and Brits are out-conniving each other for their own country's needs. The Americans are always playing their own game with their own goals that don't usually coincide with the goals of MI-5. The British spies are definitely the heroes who are saving the world. It's not the Americans this time. In fact, the American spies are usually more egotistical and sinister in their deeds that I would have expected.There was a lot of action in this season. There were character changes and more in-depth stories. It was clear the series was headed for more and more changes. I can never get enough of MI-5. This season was the most intense. London is always on the brink of destruction and only the MI-5 can save them. I watched the episodes as often as I could but sometimes I had to leave the show for a few days to watch another DVD. I wish this series would have an episode guide. None of the seasons have had one. Episodes are numbered and usually 2 on a disk. It's hard to keep track of what episodes have been watched when there is no name to the episode or a description. I wondered why that information was left out.Season 6 ends with another big cliff-hanger. Who lives and who dies? I better get to Season 7 now.",4,NOTHING IS EVER AS IT SEEMS WITH MI-5,1321920000,"11 22, 2011",2011,3280,"['Season', '5', 'MI-5', 'ended', 'such', 'bang', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Season', '6', 'begin', 'get', 'better', 'explanation', 'what', 'happened', 'Ros', 'Adam', 'survived', 'Thames', 'Barrier', 'incident', 'When', 'started', 'watching', 'Season', '6', 'thought', 'had', 'wrong', 'disk', 'Ros', 'Adam', 'are', 'quickly', 'new', 'adventure', 'brief', 'comment', 'getting', 'latest', 'escapade', 'then', 'talking', 'how', 'got', 'here', ""'ll"", 'see', 'where', 'are', 'when', 'show', 'Thames', 'Barrier', 'incident', 'never', 'mentioned', 'again', 'even', 'expected', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'closure', 'story.Instead', 'Season', '6', 'really', 'turn', 'normal', 'story', 'whole', 'season', 'basically', 'one', 'ongoing', 'story', 'lots', 'side', 'stories', 'favorite', 'character', 'Ruth', 'Evershed', 'played', 'Nicola', 'Walker', 'gone', 'season', 'apparently', 'explanation', 'lovely', 'Gemma', 'Jones', 'cast', 'Connie', 'James', 'great', 'see', 'older', 'actress', 'joining', 'cast', 'mainly', 'young', 'actors', 'MI-5', 'cast', 'fine', 'group', 'actors', 'show', 'even', 'more', 'special', 'Alex', 'Lanipekun', 'also', 'cast', 'young', 'dedicated', 'journalist', 'named', 'Ben', 'Kaplan', 'who', 'uncovering', 'secrets', 'neither', 'Iranian', 'British', 'spies', 'want', 'discover', 'great', 'addition', 'cast', 'normal', 'honest', 'guy', 'who', 'unintentionally', 'wrapped', 'up', 'world', 'espionage.This', 'season', 'Iranians', 'who', 'are', 'up', 'good', 'yet', 'MI-5', 'responsible', 'major', 'disaster', 'Tehran', 'Even', 'good', 'guys', 'get', 'wrong', 'make', 'disastrous', 'decisions', 'Iran', 'UK', 'are', 'preparing', 'peace', 'agreement', 'becoming', 'clear', 'Iran', 'getting', 'one', 'component', 'be', 'able', 'create', 'nuclear', 'bomb.Here', 'where', 'MI-5', 'must', 'save', 'UK', 'world', 'Iranian', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'New', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'form', 'Iranian', 'diplomat', 'wife', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'believed', 'trusted', 'Everyone', 'own', 'plan', 'action.Harry', 'Pearce', 'fondness', 'American', 'counterparts', 'clearer', 'Season', '6', 'Americans', 'Brits', 'are', 'out-conniving', 'other', 'own', 'country', 'needs', 'Americans', 'are', 'always', 'playing', 'own', 'game', 'own', 'goals', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'coincide', 'goals', 'MI-5', 'British', 'spies', 'are', 'definitely', 'heroes', 'who', 'are', 'saving', 'world', 'not', 'Americans', 'time', 'fact', 'American', 'spies', 'are', 'usually', 'more', 'egotistical', 'sinister', 'deeds', 'would', 'have', 'expected.There', 'was', 'lot', 'action', 'season', 'were', 'character', 'changes', 'more', 'in-depth', 'stories', 'was', 'clear', 'series', 'was', 'headed', 'more', 'more', 'changes', 'can', 'never', 'get', 'enough', 'MI-5', 'season', 'was', 'most', 'intense', 'London', 'always', 'brink', 'destruction', 'only', 'MI-5', 'can', 'save', 'watched', 'episodes', 'as', 'often', 'could', 'sometimes', 'had', 'leave', 'show', 'few', 'days', 'watch', 'DVD', 'wish', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'episode', 'guide', 'None', 'seasons', 'have', 'had', 'one', 'Episodes', 'are', 'numbered', 'usually', '2', 'disk', 'hard', 'keep', 'track', 'what', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'watched', 'when', 'name', 'episode', 'description', 'wondered', 'why', 'information', 'was', 'left', 'out.Season', '6', 'ends', 'big', 'cliff-hanger', 'Who', 'who', 'better', 'get', 'Season', '7', 'now']",N/A

1185856,A2VODABWSVHV8E,B001EHF3RS,"Ray ""A Reader""","[2, 2]","By the start of Season Six, the BBC's ""MI-5"" has thoroughly established itself as one of the world's premier drama shows. The previous five seasons have woven drama, intrigue, excitement, and intelligent storytelling together in a manner rarely seen in television, and each Season has seen us wonder how the enterprise could possible maintain such an accomplishment, yet is only to out-do itself again the following year. Season Six follows that same trajectory accomplishment, and without giving any spoilers, we can say that the series takes a darker and more sinister tone at various points that are perhaps some of the most intense in the series six year track. It can be argued that Season Six is one of the strongest of an already incredibly strong series of Seasons.MI-5, in case you are unfamiliar with the show, is a section of the security service in the UK that addresses domestic threats. The threats can be of any nature--terrorist, economic, public disturbance, and many others--but these categories of threats are those that are deemed a threat to national security and safety, and MI-5 is called upon to monitor, track, and intervene to address them. The ""MI-5"" television show attempts to tell a dramatized version of this branch of the security services by allowing us to see the individuals who choose to join ""5"" and are often unexpectedly impacted by the requirements of the job as they seek to keep the public safety. The episodes usually deal with one specific threat and 5's response to it, yet many episodes are woven together into a larger, more long running story that encompasses many episodes, sometimes, an entire season. That's why ""MI-5"" is best watched in episode-by-episode order, starting with Season One.In Season Six, the Section D team of MI-5 is faced with a extra-national threat that brings the entire service into situations both complex and ill-defined, with lots of judgment call decisions, intense risk taking, and the requirement to juggle internal security with political and national demands. In Season Six we see some of the most extended sequences yet, with a story line that weaves a chain from episode to episode throughout the entire Season. It's almost impossible to stop at the end of any given episode: the viewer finds that the pull of the story and the surrounding drama almost demands that the next episode be viewed immediately afterward.MI-5 is intense, dramatic, powerful, intelligent, and gorgeously filmed and acted. It is certainly one of the best shows the BBC has ever put together, a premier offering among an admittedly excellent grouping of shows already made by them. The series helps us to think upon the issues surrounding intelligence and security in a country, and the intersections between liberty and safety with which any free country must deal. It's a superb exercise in filmmaking.The Seasons:MI-5, Volume 1MI-5, Volume 2MI-5, Volume 3MI-5, Volume 4MI-5: Volume 5MI-5, Volume 6MI-5, Volume 7MI-5: Volume 8Mi-5: Volume 9Volume 10 not yet released (Dec 2011)",5,"MI-5 Continues to Amaze, with Exciting and Thought-Provoking Episodes",1325376000,"01 1, 2012",2012,3036,"['start', 'Season', 'Six', 'BBC', 'MI-5', 'thoroughly', 'established', 'one', 'world', 'premier', 'drama', 'shows', 'previous', 'five', 'seasons', 'have', 'woven', 'drama', 'intrigue', 'excitement', 'intelligent', 'storytelling', 'together', 'manner', 'rarely', 'seen', 'television', 'Season', 'seen', 'wonder', 'how', 'enterprise', 'could', 'possible', 'maintain', 'such', 'accomplishment', 'only', 'out-do', 'again', 'following', 'year', 'Season', 'Six', 'same', 'trajectory', 'accomplishment', 'giving', 'spoilers', 'can', 'say', 'series', 'darker', 'more', 'sinister', 'tone', 'various', 'points', 'are', 'perhaps', 'most', 'intense', 'series', 'six', 'year', 'track', 'can', 'be', 'argued', 'Season', 'Six', 'one', 'strongest', 'already', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'series', 'Seasons.MI-5', 'case', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'show', 'section', 'security', 'service', 'UK', 'domestic', 'threats', 'threats', 'can', 'be', 'nature', 'terrorist', 'economic', 'public', 'disturbance', 'many', 'others', 'categories', 'threats', 'are', 'are', 'deemed', 'threat', 'national', 'security', 'safety', 'MI-5', 'called', 'monitor', 'track', 'intervene', 'address', 'MI-5', 'television', 'show', 'tell', 'dramatized', 'version', 'branch', 'security', 'services', 'allowing', 'see', 'individuals', 'who', 'choose', 'join', '5', 'are', 'often', 'unexpectedly', 'impacted', 'requirements', 'job', 'seek', 'keep', 'public', 'safety', 'episodes', 'usually', 'deal', 'one', 'specific', 'threat', '5', 'response', 'yet', 'many', 'episodes', 'are', 'woven', 'together', 'larger', 'more', 'long', 'running', 'story', 'many', 'episodes', 'sometimes', 'entire', 'season', 'why', 'MI-5', 'best', 'watched', 'episode-by-episode', 'order', 'starting', 'Season', 'One.In', 'Season', 'Six', 'Section', 'D', 'team', 'MI-5', 'faced', 'extra-national', 'threat', 'entire', 'service', 'situations', 'complex', 'ill-defined', 'lots', 'judgment', 'call', 'decisions', 'intense', 'risk', 'taking', 'requirement', 'juggle', 'internal', 'security', 'political', 'national', 'demands', 'Season', 'Six', 'see', 'most', 'extended', 'sequences', 'yet', 'story', 'line', 'chain', 'episode', 'episode', 'entire', 'Season', 'almost', 'impossible', 'stop', 'end', 'given', 'episode', 'viewer', 'pull', 'story', 'surrounding', 'drama', 'almost', 'next', 'episode', 'be', 'viewed', 'immediately', 'afterward.MI-5', 'intense', 'dramatic', 'powerful', 'intelligent', 'gorgeously', 'filmed', 'acted', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'BBC', 'ever', 'put', 'together', 'premier', 'offering', 'admittedly', 'excellent', 'grouping', 'shows', 'already', 'made', 'series', 'think', 'issues', 'surrounding', 'intelligence', 'security', 'country', 'intersections', 'liberty', 'safety', 'free', 'country', 'must', 'deal', 'superb', 'exercise', 'filmmaking.The', 'Seasons', 'MI-5', 'Volume', '1MI-5', 'Volume', '2MI-5', 'Volume', '3MI-5', 'Volume', '4MI-5', 'Volume', '5MI-5', 'Volume', '6MI-5', 'Volume', '7MI-5', 'Volume', '8Mi-5', 'Volume', '9Volume', '10', 'not', 'yet', 'released', 'Dec', '2011']",N/A

The actors were effective as agents and heartwrenching as characters.  The last epi did it for me. As the other commentors stated, epi 10 and a few others were dark and realistic. Rupert is the man. As always Harry Pearce was dapper, intriguing, SEXY as hell, and was totally the leader of the group.  More insight into quirky Malcom also. Jo was sweet and resourceful.
