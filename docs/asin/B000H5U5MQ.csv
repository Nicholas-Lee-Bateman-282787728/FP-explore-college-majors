I thought one episode was weak but the others were great.  I liked every episode of season two very much--no weak episodes here.  Dangerous Davies is supposedly the last detective his boss would send out on a case, but in season two he gets more responsibility and at times seems to be the intended chief investigator on real murder cases.  Still, most episodes begin with him being put in an embarassing situation to keep his image as the butt of department jokes.  There are no cheap shocks in the series, rather it is an enjoyable show featuring a decent and dogged detective.  Almost all the criminals and suspects like him because he's unprepossessing, direct, and sympathetic or at least understanding.  Peter Davison was a bit bland as Campion, but he's excellent here, very decent and put upon, but not weak or feckless, in fact he shows some impishness and unexpected forcefulness at times this season.  His body language and facial expressions clearly convey what he is thinking and feeling as his cases progress.  Likewise, while Campion's almost-two hour shows dragged at times, the one-hour format makes for great pacing here.  Davies's friend Mod is also a treat--a combination of self-impressed intellectual, gullible self-improver, and deluded expert on all things who is charming in his goofy way. I'm looking forward to season three and the apparently in-progress season four in the future.

1009688,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B000H5U5MQ,C. O. DeRiemer,"[13, 14]","The last detective is Detective Constable Davies --""Dangerous"" Davies to his coworkers. He's the least likely cop to find himself in a dangerous situation, or so they think, and his boss has said that Davies is the last detective he'd ever assign to an important case. Davies (Peter Davison) may be a bit of a plodder, may be too nice for his own good, but he's also thorough, conscientious and firmly committed to find the bad guys wherever the search takes him. In The Last Detective series, Davies' cases always start out being mundane and, on the surface, uncomplicated. But Dangerous Davies has a habit of uncovering hidden motives, long-ago murders, ruthless ambitions and, just about as often, victims who have no other resource than Davies' commitment to justice.So far, so good. Davies is played by Peter Davison with immense likability. Davison made his acting name as Tristan Farnon in All Creatures Great and Small nearly thirty years ago. He has gone on to play all sorts of characters, from the well-bred gentleman detective Albert Campion to the good doctor himself in Dr. Who. Davison is one of these people you like as soon as you see him. That's a vital element in the success of The Last Detective series. The tough fact is that Davies is really the only likable character in the series. His best friend, Mod Lewis (Sean Hughes), is such a fey character that Mod seems more like just a writer's device than anything else. The friendship between the nice-guy Davies and the off-the-wall Mod is never explained and seems unlikely. Davies' estranged wife, whom he wants to get back together with, comes across in every scene they share as petulant and selfish. The two detectives he works with who constantly put him down are simply unpleasant. And his boss has few characteristics that we can admire.That leaves Peter Davison carrying the weight of the show, and he just about succeeds. We may want Davies to ditch his wife once and for all, to tell his two coworkers to stuff it and to not be so concerned about Mod's feelings...but as soon as Davies goes back to whatever the crime is he's trying to solve, we go back to enjoying the mystery. And that's because of the likability and intelligence that Davison brings to the character.The mysteries in Series Two are adequate. There are four, each one about 70 minutes long. The DVD transfer is first rate. If you enjoy solid British TV mysteries, you'll probably enjoy The Last Detective, but you might not put it at the top of your list.

1009691,A29VKODW4R5U7W,B000H5U5MQ,dooby,"[22, 22]","This enjoyable low-key British crime drama continues with Peter Davison as the under-appreciated, constantly bullied, but well-loved copper, DC Davies. Following his eviction by his landlady, he is now forced to live with his idiosyncratic friend Mod (Sean Hughes). His estranged wife, Julie (Emma Amos), doesn't appear until the 2nd episode and this season we get to see a less pleasant side of her. The second season doesn't have quite as much interaction between Davies and his friends and colleagues as I would have like. This was its appeal to me in the first season. Here it focuses more on the crime solving and mystery element. The mysteries however don't have quite the polish of those from Arthur Conan Doyle, P.D. James or Agatha Christie. Still they serve as moderately intriguing puzzlers. Again, just 4 episodes in this season. British seasons are so painfully short. Thankfully the episodes last a good 70-minutes each.Episode 1 (Christine) finds Davies looking into the mysterious demise of a rich painter, apparently burnt to death in his own locked room. Suspicion falls on the young, alluringly beautiful and not too grieving widow, Christine (the very sexy Susan Vidler). Mod comes up with his usual crackpot theory: spontaneous human combustion.Episode 2 (The Long Bank Holiday) finds Davies bullied into working over the Easter weekend. He helps an Indian pharmacist settle a dispute with a racist neighbour and then discovers a horde of buried bones in the man's backyard. An apparent suicide on the train tracks and the disappearance of a prisoner on home-leave are tied together by a murder that happened 20 years ago.Episode 3 (Benefit to Mankind) has Davies travelling to Wales to look into the apparent suicide of a scientist involved in pharmaceutical research and the subsequent disappearance of his assistant. His sympathetic boss tries to help by counselling him to be more assertive and Davies finally shows some temper and backbone by standing up to the young detectives who constantly poke fun at him.Episode 4 (Dangerous & The Lonely Hearts) is based on the last of Leslie Thomas' ""Dangerous"" novels. It is also the most satisfying of the four episodes. Davies helps 8-year-old Katie track down her mother's killer. Davies discovers that his boss visits the same dating agency as the dead mother and that they had gone out together. He also reaches the end of the tether with his estranged wife and gives her an ultimatum.Not quite as sunny and jovial as the first season, this still makes for a very pleasant evening of light, easy-going entertainment. Like the previous season, Acorn presents this in the original 1.78:1 widescreen (Anamorphic). The 4 episodes are generously spread over 2 discs. Picture quality is excellent. Sound is in the original 2.0 Dolby Surround. Again, no subtitles are provided. Extras include a biography and bibliography for Leslie Thomas, a cast filmography and a picture gallery.Note: The Fourth season has already aired in Britain and the Fifth is currently in production.",4,The Underdog Detective plods on...

He's such an interesting, loveable character (c'mon, don't you just want to feed him tea and cookies?) that the mysteries take a back seat.  This isn't to say they aren't good - they are well-paced and would work even without such a good cast - but they just can't compare with the characters.Even the side characters (his landlady, his best friend, his dog) are just so unique and interesting, though not in a completely unbelievable, over-the-top way.

1009709,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B000H5U5MQ,Stephanie De Pue,"[1, 1]","The second of the sleeper hit British television mystery series, ""The Last Detective, Series 2,""now finds its way here.  The series, a witty police procedural that we've never had a chance to see televised on this side of the Atlantic, is light-hearted, in the vein ofMidsomer Murders: Set 13; orRosemary & Thyme - The Complete Series.  As released here, it consists of four new, full-length puzzlers.  It is based on the Dangerous Davies novels by Welshman Leslie Thomas; was produced by the British firm Granada for Britain's Independent Television (ITV).Peter Davison (All Creatures Great & Small: The Complete Series 1 Collection) plays the title character, a rumpled, clumsy, lowly detective constable.  He is called ""Dangerous"" Davies ironically, as he is of hardly any danger to society's criminal elements - he's much more dangerous to his friends, family, and co-workers.  Furthermore, his boss has labeled him the last detective, as in ""You're the last detective I'd ever put on a case, except a crap one.""  And, as if to emphasize his light weight in the greater scheme of things, Davies works in Willesden, an unimportant, out-of-the- way North London precinct.  Nevertheless, working in his plodding fashion, he generally gets his man, or woman, succeeding where his slicker co-workers fail.Davison gets great support from Sean Hughes (the guy from Eejit records inThe Commitments), playing his eccentric friend Mod.  Hughes brings a lot to the character, and makes Mod much more than just a sounding board. The beautiful, and voluptuous Emma Amos does well as Davison's estranged wife Julie; Davison, a born nice guy who doesn't very often come in first, frequently finds himself mending her fences, or plunging her toilets, while she takes off for sunny foreign places with her beau of the minute.  Rob Spendlove gives us a fully-inhabited, full of tics, tough supervisor, Detective Inspector Aspinall.  Charles De'Ath as DS Pimlott and  Billy Geraghty as DC Barrett contribute a great deal to the particular flavor of Willesden's police station.  In addition, the series is chock-full of enjoyable characters, expressing themselves in the typical North London accent, to add to the enjoyable ""local,"" but foreign, flavor.  The series is certainly character-rich and character-driven.Davies, who's nice even when he's drunk, is unfailingly polite to all.  The mysteries in this second of the series, some of them based directly on the works of Thomas are complex and flavorful.  They are:1. ""Christine."" Wealthy would-be painter Maurice Leyman dies drunk in a fire while shut up in his studio.  So Davies, with many possible candidates for the perpetrator among the unpopular man's acquaintance and family, faces the classic ""locked door"" mystery.  Even the newly widowed Christine doesn't seem too upset at her husband's death.2. ""The Long Bank Holiday.""  It's Easter, and Davies had plans. But some computer thefts from government offices, a possible suicide at the rail yards, an absconded lifer on the loose, and a grisly find of human bones in a suburban garden all conspire to ruin the detective's holiday.3. ""Benefit to Mankind.""  Henry Winton's body is found in a canal.  He seems an open-and shut suicide, with a history of depression, a booze-filled bloodstream, and a high-pressure job in big bucks medical research.  But Davies has a feeling about SwanMed, Winton's employer, particularly when Winton's pretty young coworker goes missing.  This episode guest stars the greatly admired actor David Threlfall, who starred as Smike in ""The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby."" Frankly; he seems wasted in his part here. It also co-stars Susan Wooldridge, who starred as Daphne Manners in ""The Jewel in the Crown.""4. ""Dangerous and the Lonely Hearts."" A waifish Eastern European girl is brought to the station for shoplifting.  Davies soon finds her pretty mother strangled.  All clues seem to lead to a video dating service, where Davies finds some surprising suspects.This series is a great find: it's witty, entertaining, and intellectually and emotionally satisfying.  But: and now presents the De Pue closed captions report: there are none, and they are needed. You'll find that the cast does rapid-fire North London dialect, without regard for us country cousins over here. So you're going to have to work at it.",4,A Witty Police Procedural that's New to Us,1220572800,"09 5, 2008",2008,4347,"['second', 'sleeper', 'hit', 'British', 'television', 'mystery', 'series', 'Last', 'Detective', 'Series', '2', 'now', 'way', 'here', 'series', 'witty', 'police', 'procedural', ""'ve"", 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'televised', 'side', 'Atlantic', 'light-hearted', 'vein', 'Murders', 'Set', '13', 'orRosemary', 'Thyme', 'Complete', 'Series', 'released', 'here', 'four', 'new', 'full-length', 'puzzlers', 'based', 'Dangerous', 'Davies', 'novels', 'Welshman', 'Leslie', 'Thomas', 'was', 'produced', 'British', 'firm', 'Granada', 'Britain', 'Independent', 'Television', 'ITV', '.Peter', 'Davison', 'All', 'Creatures', 'Great', 'Small', 'Complete', 'Series', '1', 'Collection', 'title', 'character', 'rumpled', 'clumsy', 'lowly', 'detective', 'constable', 'called', 'Dangerous', 'Davies', 'ironically', 'hardly', 'danger', 'society', 'criminal', 'elements', 'much', 'more', 'dangerous', 'friends', 'family', 'co-workers', 'Furthermore', 'boss', 'labeled', 'last', 'detective', ""'re"", 'last', 'detective', ""'d"", 'ever', 'put', 'case', 'crap', 'one', 'emphasize', 'light', 'weight', 'greater', 'scheme', 'things', 'Davies', 'Willesden', 'unimportant', 'out-of-the-', 'way', 'North', 'London', 'precinct', 'Nevertheless', 'working', 'plodding', 'fashion', 'generally', 'man', 'woman', 'succeeding', 'where', 'slicker', 'co-workers', 'fail.Davison', 'great', 'support', 'Sean', 'Hughes', 'guy', 'Eejit', 'records', 'inThe', 'Commitments', 'playing', 'eccentric', 'friend', 'Mod', 'Hughes', 'lot', 'character', 'Mod', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'sounding', 'board', 'beautiful', 'voluptuous', 'Emma', 'Amos', 'well', 'Davison', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Julie', 'Davison', 'born', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', ""n't"", 'very', 'often', 'come', 'first', 'frequently', 'mending', 'fences', 'plunging', 'toilets', 'sunny', 'foreign', 'places', 'beau', 'minute', 'Rob', 'Spendlove', 'fully-inhabited', 'full', 'tics', 'tough', 'supervisor', 'Detective', 'Inspector', 'Aspinall', 'Charles', ""De'Ath"", 'DS', 'Pimlott', 'Billy', 'Geraghty', 'DC', 'Barrett', 'contribute', 'great', 'deal', 'particular', 'flavor', 'Willesden', 'police', 'station', 'addition', 'series', 'chock-full', 'enjoyable', 'characters', 'expressing', 'typical', 'North', 'London', 'accent', 'add', 'enjoyable', 'local', 'foreign', 'flavor', 'series', 'certainly', 'character-rich', 'character-driven.Davies', 'who', 'nice', 'even', 'when', 'drunk', 'unfailingly', 'polite', 'mysteries', 'second', 'series', 'based', 'directly', 'works', 'Thomas', 'are', 'complex', 'flavorful', 'are:1', 'Christine', 'Wealthy', 'would-be', 'painter', 'Maurice', 'Leyman', 'drunk', 'fire', 'shut', 'up', 'studio', 'Davies', 'many', 'possible', 'candidates', 'perpetrator', 'unpopular', 'man', 'acquaintance', 'family', 'classic', 'locked', 'door', 'mystery', 'Even', 'newly', 'widowed', 'Christine', ""n't"", 'seem', 'too', 'upset', 'husband', 'death.2', 'Long', 'Bank', 'Holiday', 'Easter', 'Davies', 'had', 'plans', 'computer', 'thefts', 'government', 'offices', 'possible', 'suicide', 'rail', 'yards', 'absconded', 'lifer', 'loose', 'grisly', 'find', 'human', 'bones', 'suburban', 'garden', 'conspire', 'ruin', 'detective', 'holiday.3', 'Benefit', 'Mankind', 'Henry', 'Winton', 'body', 'found', 'canal', 'open-and', 'shut', 'suicide', 'history', 'depression', 'booze-filled', 'bloodstream', 'high-pressure', 'job', 'big', 'bucks', 'medical', 'research', 'Davies', 'feeling', 'SwanMed', 'Winton', 'employer', 'particularly', 'when', 'Winton', 'pretty', 'young', 'coworker', 'missing', 'episode', 'guest', 'greatly', 'admired', 'actor', 'David', 'Threlfall', 'who', 'starred', 'Smike', 'Life', 'Adventures', 'Nicholas', 'Nickleby', 'Frankly', 'wasted', 'part', 'here', 'also', 'Susan', 'Wooldridge', 'who', 'starred', 'Daphne', 'Manners', 'Jewel', 'Crown.', '4', 'Dangerous', 'Lonely', 'Hearts', 'waifish', 'Eastern', 'European', 'girl', 'brought', 'station', 'shoplifting', 'Davies', 'soon', 'pretty', 'mother', 'strangled', 'clues', 'seem', 'lead', 'video', 'dating', 'service', 'where', 'Davies', 'surprising', 'suspects.This', 'series', 'great', 'find', 'witty', 'entertaining', 'intellectually', 'emotionally', 'satisfying', 'now', 'De', 'Pue', 'closed', 'captions', 'report', 'are', 'none', 'are', 'needed', ""'ll"", 'find', 'cast', 'rapid-fire', 'North', 'London', 'dialect', 'regard', 'country', 'here', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'work']",The Last Detective - Series 2
