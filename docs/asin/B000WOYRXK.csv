1111093,A2W1FEPSD6EOCI,B000WOYRXK,cinephile,"[1, 1]","Im writing this hours after having seen ""The taste of Corn"".  This very moving and fantastic film is interwoven meticulously creating a very heavy suspenseful drama with a subject matter most would consider very taboo.  However, Lorenzo Lena manages to create sympathy and even empathy as we see his plight given a very inappropriate situation.  Making matters worse, the family loves him and may have an idea of what is really going on.  It is a difficult subject matter to undergo, but the film beautifully presents the conflicts with honesty, warmth & heart.  If you can find this 1986 movie, you must give yourself an opportunity to experience this gem of a film.  You won't regret it.  simply put... engaging and outstanding.",5,"A heavy, sad and  outstanding drama that will stay with you long after watching.",1380326400,"09 28, 2013",2013,730,"['Im', 'writing', 'hours', 'having', 'seen', 'taste', 'Corn', 'very', 'moving', 'fantastic', 'film', 'interwoven', 'meticulously', 'creating', 'very', 'heavy', 'suspenseful', 'drama', 'subject', 'matter', 'most', 'would', 'consider', 'very', 'taboo', 'However', 'Lorenzo', 'Lena', 'create', 'sympathy', 'even', 'empathy', 'see', 'plight', 'given', 'very', 'inappropriate', 'situation', 'Making', 'matters', 'worse', 'family', 'may', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'difficult', 'subject', 'matter', 'undergo', 'film', 'beautifully', 'conflicts', 'honesty', 'warmth', 'heart', 'can', 'find', '1986', 'movie', 'must', 'give', 'opportunity', 'experience', 'gem', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'simply', 'put', 'engaging', 'outstanding']",N/A

Neto,"[4, 4]","I was moved by this film, and by its simple and yet solid plot.This is one of those movies that linger on your mind long after you've watched it. My head was full of questions and I'm still thinking about them.I wonder what Lorenzo really felt for the boy. Was it the affection of an older brother or was there something else? I tend to go for the second option, although it was clear that he felt uncomfortable with it. The moment he kisses Adalgisa, it gave me the impression that he wished it was Duilio.Then again, it may be just my imagination.Someone said it ended the way it should, although there could have been a different ending.

The teacher was very responsible. The teacher (called professor, in some european countries) was a young man. He forms a close attachment to Duillio. He even spends some time at the boys house. Even gives the boy viewpoints on things like art and other life issues. This movie should not be shown to anyone under sixteen. There are several intimate lovemaking sessions between the teacher and other adult women. However I do love Italian that was spoken in this movie. Nice production, if you don't mind some of the sexual interludes.",5,good movie.

1111098,A28TSZUILM00N4,B000WOYRXK,schumann_bg,"[4, 4]","The Flavor of Corn is a very lovable film that tells of a young teacher with a rather offputting girlfriend (shown quite explicitly together) who also finds himself to some extent responding to a young male pupil's pubescent crush on him. It could be sensationalist but in fact it is very reserved and the feelings are well shown in all their fragility. The boy in particular brings a real intensity to his portrayal which is very convincing; he is altogether a very likeable lad who is fond of his grandfather and respectful of everyone. The family are sort-of aware of their son's feelings - they are very much a farming family and slightly in awe of the teacher, and very hospitable. The mother in particular tries to put the brakes on something she sees as dangerous, but not in an unpleasant way, while the father is very generous in spirit towards the novice teacher. They are very reasonable people (the mother played by Marina Vlady whose presence gives the whole film an added prestige factor). The images are beautiful and the music oddly touching - it carries quite a lot of the emotion and genuinely involves the heart of the viewer. There's a moment when the boy gives his tutor a model boat and the latter just sits at his kitchen table looking at it. It doesn't sound like much but the music conveys all the emotional import of the gift and the slightly perplexed but touched reaction of the young man.",5,very sweet film,1331769600,"03 15, 2012",2012,1417,"['Flavor', 'Corn', 'very', 'lovable', 'film', 'young', 'teacher', 'rather', 'offputting', 'girlfriend', 'shown', 'quite', 'explicitly', 'together', 'who', 'also', 'extent', 'responding', 'young', 'male', 'pupil', 'pubescent', 'crush', 'could', 'be', 'sensationalist', 'fact', 'very', 'reserved', 'feelings', 'are', 'well', 'shown', 'fragility', 'boy', 'particular', 'brings', 'real', 'intensity', 'portrayal', 'very', 'convincing', 'altogether', 'very', 'likeable', 'lad', 'who', 'fond', 'grandfather', 'respectful', 'everyone', 'family', 'are', 'sort-of', 'aware', 'son', 'feelings', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'farming', 'family', 'slightly', 'awe', 'teacher', 'very', 'hospitable', 'mother', 'particular', 'tries', 'put', 'brakes', 'something', 'as', 'dangerous', 'not', 'unpleasant', 'way', 'father', 'very', 'generous', 'spirit', 'novice', 'teacher', 'are', 'very', 'reasonable', 'people', 'mother', 'played', 'Marina', 'Vlady', 'presence', 'whole', 'film', 'added', 'prestige', 'factor', 'images', 'are', 'beautiful', 'music', 'oddly', 'touching', 'quite', 'lot', 'emotion', 'genuinely', 'heart', 'viewer', 'moment', 'when', 'boy', 'tutor', 'model', 'boat', 'latter', 'just', 'sits', 'kitchen', 'table', 'looking', ""n't"", 'sound', 'much', 'music', 'emotional', 'import', 'gift', 'slightly', 'perplexed', 'touched', 'reaction', 'young', 'man']",N/A
