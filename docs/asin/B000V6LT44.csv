1099222,AIMR915K4YCN,B000V6LT44,"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby""","[1, 2]","In THE NUDE VAMPIRE, a man named Pierre tries to uncover the strange goings-on at his father's private chateau. After managing to sneak in, he enters a bizarre world of bloodlust and death. After witnessing a woman's suicide, Pierre is discovered. The crowd expects Pierre to kill himself, but he shoots one of them instead, then flees out the door. Pierre discovers that his father has been allowing a suicide cult to stay at the chateau. He is also told that his father is just trying to help a woman w/ a strange blood condition. Pierre gives dad 48 hours to explain his involvement in this insane situation. THE NUDE VAMPIRE is rather absurdist, loaded w/ odd characters, crazy costumes, unexplained events, and an atmosphere of lunacy. The story makes sense if viewed through its own lens. Jean Rollin has created a secret underworld, a dream-like universe where mysteries abound, and rationality takes a seat in third class. I enjoy the surreal imagery, the weird intrigue, and the general crack-pottery of it all. Oh yeah, there's a vampire chick running around as well!

Nudity, yes- it appeared that there was some attempt at making the nudity artful, but the extreme closeup of boobs and erect nipples kind of shot that down, as well as the poor (and really odd) attempt at making some of it appear erotic. Don't think that it is chock full of nudity, though, regardless of what I have written so far.

And not in the it-was-so-bad-it-was-good way, either.It is not about vampires.  I have no idea what the hell it was about, but it wasn't about those.  As for nudity, that just means not-so-attractive women remove their tops in situations where there's no apparent reason for them to do so.  But even for those obsessed with boobs, I'm afraid the unremittingly boring nature of the film will cause them to lose consciousness and miss the breast shots anyway.My attention span is good, but after the first unending half hour of cringe-worthy dialogue (when there was any), and painfully bad acting (come on, an actress does a scene where she shoots herself in the head and doesn't even bother to twitch her head to the side, but gracefully faints instead?), and complete lack of sense, plot, beauty, eroticism or anything, I ended up putting the player on fast-forward.  Even then, the extended scenes of people walking went on and on... and on.  There were many of such scenes. People walking.  I suppose it was meant to be artistic.  It failed. I'd like to say that the sheer bad-ness of this film made it funny.  Sadly, it's not so.  I only got one laugh, brought on, no doubt, by boredom-induced derision.  This from a scene where a woman tumbled down a set of stairs, supposedly unconscious, but managed to slowwwwly tumble down each step, obviously bracing and positioning and turning herself throughout the slowwww descent until she hit the bottom.  Finally, she decided to let her head slowwwwly thunk to the floor and it made a sound just like a coconut.
