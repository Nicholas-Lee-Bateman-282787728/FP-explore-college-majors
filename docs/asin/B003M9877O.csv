This is silly and amateurish, and not particularly well made. but for pure goofiness and weirdness, its first rate. Ive seem more expensive movies that werent much better, i.e. Tokyo Zombie, Ichi the Killer.

Everything is all fun and games till they bring the dead brother back that is when it all goes wrong.  The newly made zombie brother starts to eat people for his own gain.  He doesn't seem much like the run of the mill zombie.  He talks, plots and carries out his need for blood in creative ways.  It all goes downhill fast and the beer drinking, pizza eating friends have to anti up.  Suddenly they all have super powers and they fight the zombies.

Come one people I can't beleive anyone can look at this movie and think it would be return of the body snatchers.  This looks like a video made by a bunch of high school students.  I enjoyed Ninjas Vs. Zombies simply because; I did not go in expecting more than this little Zombie Movie could offer.  I like having some weak Zombie movies in my collection just so I can see how bad, BAD can get.  The only real negative I have for this movie is the plot seems confused.  the characters seemed muddled.  There is no clear hero.  Heck there is no one to really like on a consistent basis.  Ninjas Vs. Zombies is interesting in the sense that you ask yourself what were the people that made this tripe thinking.  You never get absorbed by Ninjas Vs. Zombies because; the characters are never developed enough for you to care about who they are.  It is not that the SF effects are cheap, they are almost sort of good.  This movie NEVER draws you into investing in the story or its characters.  A good movie makes me forget, I am watching a ""Movie"" and Ninjas Vs. Zombies never once made me forget I was watching a movie.  So why did I rate Ninjas Vs. Zombies 4 stars because; it was pretty much the DVD Dog I expected it to be.  Every so often I am actually shopping for bad movies I can look at and wonder WHAT WERE THE PEOPLE MAKING THIS MOVIE THINKING and on that score Ninjas Vs. Zombies delivers 4 stars worth for sure!  I enjoyed this movie in a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 sort of way which is NOT a BAD THING!  This Ninjas Vs. Zombies Movie was cheap mindless fun.
