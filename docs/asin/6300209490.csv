Even funnier than that is when Trotskyites in the 1980's changed their minds and became Neo-Cons. An account of the differences and polemics between Trotskyites and Stalinists would have been interesting, perhaps, but the movie does not deliver any light on that.",2,the funniest line,1373500800,"07 11, 2013",2013,444,"['funniest', 'line', 'movie', 'when', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'Trotsky', 'who', 'founded', 'Red', 'Army', 'was', 'responsible', 'extermination', 'millions', 'Stalin', 'sociopath', 'Even', 'funnier', 'when', 'Trotskyites', '1980', 'changed', 'minds', 'became', 'Neo-Cons', 'account', 'differences', 'polemics', 'Trotskyites', 'Stalinists', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'perhaps', 'movie', 'not', 'deliver', 'light']",N/A

The leaflet said: ""Trotsky was a mighty warrior. His pencil was his sword and his eyeglasses were his shield"".And no, I don't know if this is a true story, but I heard it second hand from several sources. The Posadists also believed in UFOs and wanted Brezhnev to nuke America. Or so the grapevine says. The truth may be very different, but since nobody seems to take this movie seriously, I guess I could report this funny rumour...As for the movie itself, I've only seen it once. And no, it wasn't very good. Trotsky, after all, was a MIGHTY WARRIOR.

Burton is ridiculously miscast in the role of Trotsky. Not only is he physically wrong for the part (too fat, bloated and drunk), his attempts at interpreting Trotsky's character are ludicrous and extraordinarily pitiful. The make-up is another irritating element: the pathetic stick-on goatee Burton wears literally comes close to falling off in several scenes, which brings some much-needed hilarity to the leaden script. Watch when Burton screams various lines as the goatee comes dangerously close to falling off onto his chin. Hilarious stuff!Another ridiculous scene is the climatic assassination, where the viewer urgently roots for Burton to die an agonizing death. Why? Because he has just put us, the collective viewers, in a catatonic state for the past 2 hours, sitting through this bloated, bombastic turkey of a film. This is a wretchedly dreadful movie, but hilarious in parts.",1,"A dreadful, bombastic turkey",1055548800,"06 14, 2003",2003,1034,"['movie', 'become', 'something', 'camp', 'classic', 'long', 'numbing', 'line', 'perfectly', 'dreadful', 'movies', 'made', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'Burton', 'ridiculously', 'miscast', 'role', 'Trotsky', 'Not', 'only', 'physically', 'wrong', 'part', 'too', 'fat', 'bloated', 'drunk', 'attempts', 'interpreting', 'Trotsky', 'character', 'are', 'ludicrous', 'extraordinarily', 'pitiful', 'make-up', 'irritating', 'element', 'pathetic', 'stick-on', 'goatee', 'Burton', 'literally', 'close', 'falling', 'off', 'several', 'scenes', 'much-needed', 'hilarity', 'leaden', 'script', 'Watch', 'when', 'Burton', 'various', 'lines', 'goatee', 'dangerously', 'close', 'falling', 'off', 'chin', 'Hilarious', 'stuff', 'ridiculous', 'scene', 'climatic', 'assassination', 'where', 'viewer', 'urgently', 'roots', 'Burton', 'die', 'agonizing', 'death', 'Why', 'just', 'put', 'collective', 'viewers', 'catatonic', 'state', 'past', '2', 'hours', 'sitting', 'bloated', 'bombastic', 'turkey', 'film', 'wretchedly', 'dreadful', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'parts']",N/A
207514,A27CFNHYZG6WS8,6300209490,darragh o'donoghue,"[17, 23]","In the late 1960s and early 70s, there was a remarkable popularity in political thrillers (e.g. 'Z', 'The Day of the Jackal'), in which normally dull subjects like history, politics, civil service procedurals, etc., were given excitement by their being placed in a suspense context. Losey, typically, makes an anti-thriller political movie - even if you don't know your history, the title is a give away: the key sequences that could have been suspenseful (especially the assassination) are deliberately obscured and fragmented. Losey is more interested in historical representation, the way Trotsky in particular, and Marxism in general, was turned from history into myth, symbol and spectacle - his film abounds in books, speeches, films, murals, parades, photographs, all trying to impose their version. Losey's film thrives on paradox - his man-of-action hero spends the movie virtually imprisoned in his home with his family; the reactionary assassin is the real revolutionary, destroying not only Trotsky and his family, but the very notion of 'identity' from which Trotsky (and all Great Men) derives his power (Losey makes brilliant use of Alain Delon and memories of his famous roles like the hitman in 'Le Samourai'). 'Assassination' is more interesting than entertaining: the pace is deadly slow, the colour muddy, and the performances (Delon excepted) poor. The elaborate opening sequence of a May Day parade in Mexico makes the film a must-see.",3,Joseph Losey makes an anti-political thriller.,999129600,"08 30, 2001",2001,1457,"['late', '1960s', 'early', '70s', 'was', 'remarkable', 'popularity', 'political', 'thrillers', 'e.g', 'Z', 'Day', 'Jackal', 'normally', 'dull', 'subjects', 'history', 'politics', 'civil', 'service', 'procedurals', 'etc.', 'were', 'given', 'excitement', 'being', 'placed', 'suspense', 'context', 'Losey', 'typically', 'anti-thriller', 'political', 'movie', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'history', 'title', 'give', 'away', 'key', 'sequences', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'suspenseful', 'especially', 'assassination', 'are', 'deliberately', 'obscured', 'fragmented', 'Losey', 'more', 'interested', 'historical', 'representation', 'way', 'Trotsky', 'particular', 'Marxism', 'general', 'was', 'turned', 'history', 'myth', 'symbol', 'spectacle', 'film', 'abounds', 'books', 'speeches', 'films', 'murals', 'parades', 'photographs', 'trying', 'impose', 'version', 'Losey', 'film', 'thrives', 'paradox', 'man-of-action', 'hero', 'movie', 'virtually', 'imprisoned', 'home', 'family', 'reactionary', 'assassin', 'real', 'revolutionary', 'destroying', 'not', 'only', 'Trotsky', 'family', 'very', 'notion', ""'identity"", 'Trotsky', 'Great', 'Men', 'power', 'Losey', 'brilliant', 'use', 'Alain', 'Delon', 'memories', 'famous', 'roles', 'hitman', ""'Le"", 'Samourai', ""'Assassination"", 'more', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'pace', 'deadly', 'slow', 'colour', 'muddy', 'performances', 'Delon', 'excepted', 'poor', 'elaborate', 'opening', 'sequence', 'May', 'Day', 'parade', 'Mexico', 'film', 'must-see']",N/A
207515,A1E6JS6C205VZD,6300209490,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[0, 0]","Very much minor Losey, this film, based on actual events, looks at the events leading up to the assassination of Trotsky in Mexico in 1940.  Alain Delon is very good in the film, while Losey, true to form, has a particular ability to create suspense through minimalist techniques - remember THE SERVANT as another example.  However the film is spoiled for me by Richard Burton's mannered performance in the central role.  While he could be a great actor in certain films - even CLEOPATRA is watchable, in a macabre kind of way - he also made some terrible films.  If he wasn't kept under a firm directorial hand, he could end up being terribly hammy.

His acting compels the viewer to believe that Trotsky was a  whimsical old man, who kept on talking about the &quot;Good Ol' Days&quot;.  For instance, when talking to his fictitious grandson, he calls himself an  &quot;Old Revolutionary&quot;, Burton forces the less informed to believe  that Lev Davidovich Trotsky was a megalomaniac who wanted nothing but  attention.In addition, the producers should have had Burton grow a  &quot;Real&quot; goatee as opposed to the obviously fake one that the prop  guy provided(or they could at least have gotten a goatee that looked like  the one Trotsky had), and of course, Burton could have lost a little weight  for the role. At no point in the movie was Burton believable in his role as  Leon Trotsky, frankly, with Burton in the role of L.D. Trotsky, I couldn't  wait until the pic-axe ending. If this were a Sunday night Movie on the  Disney channel, with no-name actors, I wouldn't be as dissapointed as I  was, because TV Movies are renowned as being mediocrities.
