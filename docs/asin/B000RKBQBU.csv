1082222,A1NF9WS7RR82MX,B000RKBQBU,J. Hill,"[5, 7]","Seinfeld's first ""season"" is actually only five episodes, as NBC hadn't fully committed to the show yet.  When these episodes got a decent reception, the network ordered thirteen more, which make up Season Two.  These first two seasons are combined in another box set, or fans can get the first mini-season by itself for next to nothing (seriously, this DVD is going for less than $2 brand new on Amazon).  In the first few episodes, the cast and staff are obviously trying to feel out the show's premise and the characters, but I think they do a great job of starting to find its rhythm.  Kramer is the most noticeably different, appearing as an eccentric shut-in at first that is quite a contrast to the ""hipster dufus"" he becomes.  George is already transitioning from a caricature of Woody Allen to one of Larry David by the fifth episode.  And Elaine probably seems the most like her character from later seasons, as Julia Louis-Dreyfuss seemed to know from the start what she wanted to do with the character.  As for Jerry...well, he's just Jerry, if maybe a little less an actor than later.  The Stake Out is the one episode of the first five that offers a glimpse of the show's full potential, and the others are funny; not hilarious like they started to be during some of Season Two, but funny.  Even before Seinfeld got great, it was better than most of the other sitcoms on TV.",4,Pilot Season--First Five Episodes Only,1313193600,"08 13, 2011",2011,1388,"['Seinfeld', 'first', 'season', 'actually', 'only', 'five', 'episodes', 'NBC', 'had', ""n't"", 'fully', 'committed', 'show', 'yet', 'When', 'episodes', 'got', 'decent', 'reception', 'network', 'ordered', 'thirteen', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'Season', 'Two', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'are', 'combined', 'box', 'set', 'fans', 'can', 'get', 'first', 'mini-season', 'next', 'nothing', 'seriously', 'DVD', 'going', 'less', '2', 'brand', 'new', 'Amazon', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'cast', 'staff', 'are', 'obviously', 'trying', 'feel', 'show', 'premise', 'characters', 'think', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'starting', 'find', 'rhythm', 'Kramer', 'most', 'noticeably', 'different', 'appearing', 'eccentric', 'shut-in', 'first', 'quite', 'contrast', 'hipster', 'dufus', 'George', 'already', 'transitioning', 'caricature', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'one', 'Larry', 'David', 'fifth', 'episode', 'Elaine', 'probably', 'most', 'character', 'later', 'seasons', 'Julia', 'Louis-Dreyfuss', 'seemed', 'know', 'start', 'what', 'wanted', 'do', 'character', 'Jerry', 'well', 'just', 'Jerry', 'maybe', 'little', 'less', 'actor', 'later', 'Stake', 'Out', 'one', 'episode', 'first', 'five', 'glimpse', 'show', 'full', 'potential', 'others', 'are', 'funny', 'not', 'hilarious', 'started', 'be', 'Season', 'Two', 'funny', 'Even', 'Seinfeld', 'got', 'great', 'was', 'better', 'most', 'other', 'sitcoms', 'TV']",Seinfeld - Season 1
