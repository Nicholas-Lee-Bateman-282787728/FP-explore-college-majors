406813,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6304196911,Acute Observer,"[1, 1]","Moby Dick, 1956 filmThe film begins with a young man walking down a country lane. He is looking for work at sea. The men of New Bedford explain the rules: its their ocean. He meets the tattooed harpooner. We see the seaman's chapel. Plaques commemorate lost seamen. Father Mapple teaches they should speak the truth in the face of falsehood. [An ideal that is not always politically practical.] Queeqeg tells about his life. They sign on to the `Pequod'. Whalers get a share of the profits, not wages. A skilled harpooner gets a bigger share. Do the owners control hiring? Barrels are used for the storage of goods. [Pilfer proof?] A crazy man foretells their doom, he is named Elijah. The ship leaves on a 3-year voyage. We see the other named members of the crew. Captain Ahab finally appears to address the crew. A reward is offered for sighting the white whale. Moby Dick is the target. [Is the captain obsessed?]The whale boats pull alongside to throw the harpoons. [The same technique used in ""Jaws"".] The dead whale is harvested, its blubber is heated to provide the oil used for lamp lighting and lubricants. They will sail to the Pacific. Ahab plans their voyage. Starbuck is interested in business, not revenge on a dumb brute. More whales are hunted and killed. But Ahab orders them away from their rich harvest. Starbuck reads the law on ""usurpation:, the crew isn't interested. A man falls overboard and is lost. [An omen?] The ship is becalmed. Queeqeg uses his bones to foretell the future and orders a coffin [witchcraft!]. Idleness breeds mischief. ""Thar she blows!"" The white whale is sighted. Seagulls gather for an expected feast. The captain promises to five his 10% share of the profits to the crew if they can capture and kill Moby Dick. That motivates them! The ship `Rachel' searches for a lost boat. Ahab wants a `maximum effort' from his men. A storm comes up in answer. It will speed the ship t find Moby Dick, but tears the sails. St. Elmo's Fire hits the rigging. [An omen?]Ahab tells of his first whale. Will he give up his chase? They smell land but see no land. The white whale is spotted, the row out to meet him. The harpoons strike the whale. One boat is upset, another is attacked. Ahab spears the whale before it sounds. The boats continue the attack, the whale attacks the whaleboats. Then it rams the `Pequod' and stoves in the sides so it sinks in a whirlpool. Ishmael alone survives by floating on a coffin!I never read the novel, but this condensed version  seems to be true to the original. ""Two Years Before the Mast"" was a memoir of life aboard a commercial vessel. It also told of life in California. Whaling men were usually young men who worked for a share of the money that would give them a start in life (buy a farm). This story raises the question about following a leader who does not act for the good of all but for his own personal whims, ""usurpation"". ""Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad."" Could the leaders of a country create vast debts and impoverish the people while searching to destroy something that is part of nature? You can decide for yourself.

But though the screenplay differs in a few important points from the book, I'm convinced you can't do better and it was worth the try. The screenplay is fluid, cinematic and overall very close to the spirit of the book. The film technical aspects are very good too. But what keeps this movie far from being a memorable classic is the casting. Peck as Ahab? Excuse me, but no. Mr. Peck was a very likable actor, but I think he just lacked the necessary skills to make Ahab a real Ahab. Besides looking too young and too well groomed, he just can't portray the rampant madness inherit to this character, and top it with the absolute -no questions ask- leadership of this captain who carries all his men to dead in the pursuit of his vengeance. And this is not the only miscasting: take Mr. Genn's performance as Starbuck: this is a double no! Actually, Mr. Peck would had made a perfect Starbuck! If the studios wanted a box office drawer in this movie, why didn't they do it this way? Orson Wells as Ahab, Gregory Peck as Starbucks. About Basehart's Ishmael ... well, for me Mr. Basehart couldn't do anything wrong, of course I would have loved seen him looking 10 years younger, but that great voice of his was enough for this mostly narrator role.Anyhow, the movie is highly enjoyable and I'm sure I'll watch it from time to time.",3,"Terrific screenplay, terrible wrong casting",1289260800,"11 9, 2010",2010,1433,"['Sure', 'comparison', 'greatest', 'deepest', 'books', 'time', 'simple', 'movie', 'screenplay', 'differs', 'few', 'important', 'points', 'book', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'better', 'was', 'worth', 'try', 'screenplay', 'fluid', 'cinematic', 'overall', 'very', 'close', 'spirit', 'book', 'film', 'technical', 'aspects', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'too', 'what', 'movie', 'far', 'being', 'memorable', 'classic', 'casting', 'Peck', 'Ahab', 'Excuse', 'Mr.', 'Peck', 'was', 'very', 'likable', 'actor', 'think', 'just', 'lacked', 'necessary', 'skills', 'make', 'Ahab', 'real', 'Ahab', 'looking', 'too', 'young', 'too', 'well', 'groomed', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'portray', 'rampant', 'madness', 'inherit', 'character', 'top', 'absolute', '-no', 'questions', 'ask-', 'leadership', 'captain', 'who', 'men', 'dead', 'pursuit', 'vengeance', 'not', 'only', 'miscasting', 'take', 'Mr.', 'Genn', 'performance', 'Starbuck', 'double', 'Actually', 'Mr.', 'Peck', 'would', 'had', 'made', 'perfect', 'Starbuck', 'studios', 'wanted', 'box', 'office', 'drawer', 'movie', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'way', 'Orson', 'Wells', 'Ahab', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Starbucks', 'Basehart', 'Ishmael', 'well', 'Mr.', 'Basehart', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'wrong', 'course', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'seen', 'looking', '10', 'years', 'younger', 'great', 'voice', 'was', 'enough', 'mostly', 'narrator', 'role.Anyhow', 'movie', 'highly', 'enjoyable', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'time', 'time']",Moby Dick VHS
406815,A1OTGBG66P6K5Y,6304196911,"Amazon Customer ""MRD""","[9, 9]","For fans of the epic novel, MOBY DICK, there is only one cinematographic alternative, MOBY DICK, starring Gregory Peck and directed by John Huston.  As I consider old reviews that criticize Peck's performance as Ahab, I have to say that I am puzzled.  What are these critics looking for, Jim Carrey in a Riddleresque fit of spasmodic mania and insanity?  There is such a thing, after all, as subdued insanity.  Part of the chilling nature of Peck's masterful performance is the ""still-waters-running-deep"" portrayal of the troubled whaling captain.  As well might these critics criticize Anthony Hopkins' performance as Hannibal the Cannibal in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.And the movie is a wonderful adaptation of one of the greatest literature pieces of all time.  Preserved here, as well as can be done given the epic proportions of the novel, is Melville's rhapsodic wordsmithing and idiomatic expression. John Huston and Ray Bradbury exhibit pure genius in translating a lengthy manuscript to a wonderful screenplay.Some critics, as well - individuals who cannot see the forest for the trees when it comes to comparing fifties effects to modern computer-generated and enhanced effects and animation - can't help but look at a classic and immediately begin apples to oranges comparisons that just don't hold up.  Despite its origins in 1956, this movie's special effects hold up quite nicely to modern scrutiny.Let's hope that the temptation to try to rework a masterpiece has died and that this classic is simply and completely accepted as the only alternative.THE HORSEMAN",5,THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE,1137715200,"01 20, 2006",2006,1572,"['fans', 'epic', 'novel', 'MOBY', 'DICK', 'only', 'one', 'cinematographic', 'alternative', 'MOBY', 'DICK', 'starring', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'directed', 'John', 'Huston', 'consider', 'old', 'reviews', 'criticize', 'Peck', 'performance', 'Ahab', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'puzzled', 'What', 'are', 'critics', 'looking', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Riddleresque', 'fit', 'spasmodic', 'mania', 'insanity', 'such', 'thing', 'subdued', 'insanity', 'Part', 'chilling', 'nature', 'Peck', 'masterful', 'performance', 'still-waters-running-deep', 'portrayal', 'troubled', 'whaling', 'captain', 'As', 'well', 'might', 'critics', 'criticize', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'performance', 'Hannibal', 'Cannibal', 'SILENCE', 'THE', 'LAMBS.And', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'adaptation', 'one', 'greatest', 'literature', 'pieces', 'time', 'Preserved', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'given', 'epic', 'proportions', 'novel', 'Melville', 'rhapsodic', 'wordsmithing', 'idiomatic', 'expression', 'John', 'Huston', 'Ray', 'Bradbury', 'exhibit', 'pure', 'genius', 'translating', 'lengthy', 'manuscript', 'wonderful', 'screenplay.Some', 'critics', 'as', 'well', 'individuals', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'forest', 'trees', 'when', 'comparing', 'fifties', 'effects', 'modern', 'computer-generated', 'enhanced', 'effects', 'animation', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'look', 'classic', 'immediately', 'begin', 'apples', 'oranges', 'comparisons', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'origins', '1956', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'hold', 'up', 'quite', 'nicely', 'modern', 'scrutiny.Let', 'hope', 'temptation', 'try', 'rework', 'masterpiece', 'died', 'classic', 'simply', 'completely', 'accepted', 'only', 'alternative.THE', 'HORSEMAN']",Moby Dick VHS
406816,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304196911,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 4]","Critics were not very kind to John Huston's adaptation of Herman Melville's `Moby Dick'.  After watching it, I can completely understand why.  While the bulk of the criticism was placed on the casting of Gregory Peck as self-destructive Captain Ahab, but really he is the film's least offensive oversight.  The structure of the film and the horrid pacing, not to mention the stuffiness of it all, really make this film nearly unwatchable.  The themes presented are never completely fleshed out because everything seems like an afterthought.  Basically, `Moby Dick' plays out like a series of plot points with no meat to hold them together.This being said, the performances and the special effects here are rather good.  Say what they will about Peck, I found him commanding and stern in all the right places.  He's not in the film very much, so he doesn't have a long time to show his limited range.  Basehart (the true star of the film) anchors it with a good mix of nave wonderment and contained panic.  Really though, this film belongs to Orson Welles and his five minute scene as Father Maple.  He's so natural and charismatic and commanding that I wish he had been cast as Captain Ahab!  The final battle at sea is engrossing visually, although it really lacks all context (we never get an idea of why Ahab is so obsessed and so we really could care less).I can't recommend this, because it is a dreadful bore in many parts and quite pointless at the end.

406822,ANGH6401L9Y0T,6304196911,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","Gregory Peck makes a superb Captain Ahab, this is an excellent rendering of the story we were all bullied into reading when I was in school. I still don't really understand it, but I saw things I could not really follow when I read it so against my will.Ray Bradbury gets some of the credit for that: he wrote the screenplay. He's a writer who knows how to make complicated things comprehensible without sacrificing too much of the story.As your English lit teacher no doubt made clear, the story is about obsession: Ahab's obsession to kill Moby Dick, the great white whale that was responsible for his left leg being made of ivory instead of flesh. What was not clear in the book in my youth was that it is as much about the fact that this obsession is a communicable disease: the entire crew, and finally the first mate who was ready to foment mutiny when Ahab first abandoned a large kill of gray whales to go hunting the white one. He read the law of the sea concerning a captain's duty to the owners of the ship to two senior members of the crew he thought to influence. One replied as he went out the hatch, ""The captain cannot break the law. He IS the law.""My only complaint is that the magical aspects of the story are never clearly explained. We have grown so accustomed to hearing Christians condemn any hint of magic that we forget that sailors, even Christians, were seeped in magic and superstition, and they took it very seriously indeed. I suspect this was especially true of whalers, out there with their story of Jonah and their concept of Leviathan. There are a lot of magical references, and a lot of biblical references, and they get mixed in together.As a movie, there is one glaring problem in my view: Quequeg, who is supposedly an islander chief of some sort, is clearly played by a white man. He is referred to as a ""dark man"" before we ever see him, so we are to imagine him to be dark, but he's played by a white. Why? Because in 1956, that's the way Hollywood did things. But it's stupid.Anyway, it is well done, even if I still don't understand the story completely.

It's stock full of rich slang, metaphor and jaunty old English that most readers won't understand, (especially in America since the education system is laggard and no one bothers to read books there anymore).If you're from Europe, you'll love the portrait of American sailors as ""smug, self centered prejudiced scoundrels"".Moby-Dick is classic of adventure.John Huston's film of MOBY DICK is a lousy film. It's a lousy film in its own right, apart from the great novel upon which it is based.Bradbury and Huston together murdered both Melville and Moby Dick. The factual errors in the film are too numerous to count, and are mostly gratuitious, based I'm sure on the assumption that most in the audience haven't read the novel. The dramatic tone is also, for the most part, false. There are great performances by Orson Welles and Gregory Peck, but Peck is given very poor material to work with, a very truncated Ahab.The biggest disappointment was watching the Madeirans hunt poor Right whales and try to make believe that this was something like the ""Nantucket sleigh ride"" of the old sperm whale fishery.The incredible truth of the sperm whale fishery described so vividly by Melville deserves better than the film efforts that have so far been made. Of course, the novel is much more than a whaling adventure. It is a meditation on good and evil, and a portrait of obsession, among other things.

It's stock full of rich slang, metaphor and jaunty old English that most readers won't understand, (especially in America since the education system is laggard and no one bothers to read books there anymore).If you're from Europe, you'll love the portrait of American sailors as &#34;smug, self centered prejudiced scoundrels&#34;.Moby-Dick is classic of adventure.John Huston's film of MOBY DICK is a lousy film. It's a lousy film in its own right, apart from the great novel upon which it is based.Bradbury and Huston together murdered both Melville and Moby Dick. The factual errors in the film are too numerous to count, and are mostly gratuitious, based I'm sure on the assumption that most in the audience haven't read the novel. The dramatic tone is also, for the most part, false. There are great performances by Orson Welles and Gregory Peck, but Peck is given very poor material to work with, a very truncated Ahab.The biggest disappointment was watching the Madeirans hunt poor Right whales and try to make believe that this was something like the &#34;Nantucket sleigh ride&#34; of the old sperm whale fishery.The incredible truth of the sperm whale fishery described so vividly by Melville deserves better than the film efforts that have so far been made. Of course, the novel is much more than a whaling adventure. It is a meditation on good and evil, and a portrait of obsession, among other things. But Melville takes great pains to get the whaling right, as the ground for his great artistic vision, and a film that doesn't get the whaling right really can't do justice to the novel.

Grand and extravagant, meandering and deep, the book is endless as the Pacific, episodic and full of arcane junk as an old roll-top desk in your grandpa's attic.John Huston did the only thing you could do:  strip it down to the size of a short Melville novella, and go for the essences.  He also took the classic interpretation of Ahab as fiery madman, the American id gone haywire (some may be surprised to know that the contending theory sees him as hero).The result is a fine stream of unforgettable Melvillian iconography:  the seaside dock town you can almost smell, the fully convincing Orson Welles as Father Mapple; a great Queequeg and his coffin; the dubloon nailed to the mast and Ahab handling Saint Elmo's fire; the unforgettable furrowed wall of the white whale and its spooky eye.It is no substitute for the book of course; Huston was a wise fellow who understood the limits of filmic art.

Surprisingly the film quality is rather drab at times with the appearance of old newsreel footage. This is generally the case with the shots aboard the Pequot showing billowing sails or the ship from a distance. Yet at other times it's quite artistic and mesmerizing such as; the close-up portrait cameos of the old women standing on the dock, or the brooding sermon delivered by Orson Welles at the beginning.However there are two things that raise this film to a higher, mythic level. Those two things are the magnificent performance by Gregory Peck as Captain Ahab and of course the white whale. Peck delivers a signature performance as the obsessive and defiant sea captain willing to forfeit not only his life but his soul for one more opportunity to slay the great white solitary that haunts his thoughts and dreams.Ahh..., and then there's the whale. Moby Dick is haunting, frightening and irresistible. He's gigantic, remote and seemingly unaware with the activities of Ahab and his crew thus symbolizing all the aspects of a divinity unconcerned with its creation.

406834,A4LLXH0IZ3LMQ,6304196911,"Christopher Forbes ""weirdears""","[16, 25]","I saw this movie last weekend, coming fresh from my second reading of the book, a reading that was twice as powerful as the first time I'd read it in college. I was expecting a good experience, though with the date of the movie I was prepared for some deviations from the novel. I was not expecting what I recieved in Huston and Bradberry's redaction of the plot.Moby Dick is probably an unfilmable novel, but the scenes of action and the details of the 19th century whaling trade make it understandable that a director would try anyway. And Huston and Bradberry start off well, collapsing some of the sprawling episodes in the beginning of the novel to one place and time. You lose nothing by keeping all the action in New Bedford and indeed the opening gains a bit in power. However, even here there are some serious missteps, such as allowing for a glimpse of Ahab walking the streets of New Bedford. In the novel Ahab is only talked about, not seen, for the first 100 pages or so. This helps to keep tension around the character growing, so that when he does appear he is as much myth as man. It also parallels the greater absence of the title character, who of course never appears in the flesh until the last three chapters of the novel.Once we get aboard the Pequod, the script loses faithfulness in ways that are quite harmful to the suspense of the plot and to the philosophic issues dealt with in the novel. Ahab appears too frequently, especially at the beginning...and only his monomanical speeches are kept. The more soul revealing soliliquies that make Ahab such a haunting and paradoxical character in the novel are excised and Ahab becomes all rage, more monster than man. This does a severe violence to Melville's character and his development. It's little wonder that Gregory Peck felt he couldn't bring this character to life in the movie....there's no real life in the writing.The deviations from the novel are legion. The meetings with other whaling ships, which help to shape the legend of the White Whale in the novel, are cut down to two meetings, and not even two of the most important. The character of Flask is given short shrift...while Stubb's humor is never very evident (a fault of the actor as much as the script). Starbuck comes across as an office clerk rather than a brave, careful, and ultimately moral and nobel man. Pip is almost completely elided, which robs Ahab of some of his most touching and humanizing scenes. And though the removal of Fedullah, the satan figure of the novel, perhaps makes things a bit more realistic, it also makes the ending deeply problematic and makes the Corpusants scene lose symbolic power and Zoroasterian philosophical overtones. Even the Symphony chapter, which is included here in truncated form, is so truncated that you don't have time to fully see Ahab's humanity almost come back and most viewers probably never realize that Starbuck in this scene has almost convinced Ahab to give up the whale.But most tragic and disturbing is the fact that Huston and Bradberry determine to show us Moby Dick too early....before the Pequod's meeting with the Rachel. Though I understand the need to telescope the three days chase at the end of the novel into one extended scene, by adding this earlier sighting, the power for the final confrontation with the Whale is destroyed and we never get that wonderful scene where the White Whale is first spied swimming in divine beauty. This image is perhaps one of the most important in an image ladened novel, and losing it weakens the identification of Moby Dick with God and with disinterested Nature, which is beautiful and terrible at the same time in Melville's world.The primary problems I think with the movie reside in the screenplay, but there are also many problems with casting. Peck actually does a fine job with material that just isn't nuanced enough. He makes as much as he can over Ahab's few human moments, but they occur way to late in the movie to help us feel anything but empty for Ahab. Richard Baseheart is woefully miscast as Ishmael, impressing us less as the highly educated underachiever of Melville, and more of a straight out rube. Queequeeg is just way too old and way too stiff for his part. Stubb lacks humor and Starbuck seems more like Captain Bligh than like Melville's hero. Even the best things about the movie...the whaling scenes, leave us with a sense of incongruity. Whaling looks like jolly fun, while Melville makes it abundantly clear that it is life and death business.So, even with the best of intentions, Huston is unable to deliver a movie that has any of the real impact of the Melville story. I am actually rather certain that noone can capture it in it's full power and nuance. However, I hope that in the future a director like Peter Weir, who's Master and Commander showed him capable of understanding the unique atmosphere of windpowered sailing, and who's Gallipoli showed him sensitive to the poetry in basic stories of survival, might decide to try his hand at the book. There's still a good movie to be made of this book, even if it can't include everything the author could.",2,Who IS this Ahab?,1111104000,"03 18, 2005",2005,5142,"['saw', 'movie', 'last', 'weekend',

406835,A315K47GRB024C,6304196911,Daniel C. Markel,"[5, 5]","This review is for the  MGM DVD released in 2001.The movie is based on the classic novel by Herman Melville of the same name.  The movie opens with narration by Ishmael (Richard Basehart), who travels to the seaside town of New Bedford so that he can join a whaling crew. He stays at an inn and shares a bed with a harpooner from the South Pacific named Queequeg (Friedrich Ledebur). At first Ishmael is repulsed by Queequeg's tattoos and a shrunken head that he carries into the room, but they soon become good friends and accept employment on the whaling ship Pequod.  As the ship is about to set sail, they meet the mysterious ship captain Ahab (Gregory Peck) who has a wooden leg from a previous whaling encounter with a great white whale.  Ahab's right hand man is Starbuck, who is a devout Quaker.  The ship sets sail and Ahab makes his mission clear to his crew: to capture this white whale he has named Moby Dick.  As the movie progresses there is at first tension and later nearly outright mutiny between Ahab and Starbuck regarding the true mission of the voyage and the moral obligations he has with his fellow man which builds up to a dramatic ending.The movie has many strengths and few weaknesses.  One refreshing aspect that stood out for me is how much of the dialogue dealt with God and man's Christian beliefs.  Discussions such as this have now become pretty much taboo in Hollywood in this day and age.  One terrific scene is a cameo appearance by Orsen Wells who plays Father Mapple, a minister who gives a stirring sermon to his congregation about Jonah and the whale.  There are certainly a lot of metaphors and moral lessons in this movie.  I'm glad I bought this DVD, so that I can watch it over and over and pull out more of the abstract meanings and observe the subtle nuances of the film.  John Huston directed this great film and for being shot nearly 20 years before the movie ""Jaws"", it gives a convincing presentation of whale hunting.As for the DVD, an unrestored master copy was obviously used, so a few tiny blemishes would mar the color picture quality on occasion but they seemed to be few and far between.  The color and sharpness were not of today's standards, but excellent for a movie this old.  The audio was slightly below average, but it did not detract significantly from the presentation of the story.  The DVD did not offer any bonuses except a trailer.  The making of this movie would have been excellent bonus material since it was clearly a technically challenging project for a film from this era.Movie: A-DVD Quality: B+",5,A classic adventure story with plenty of lessons about life!,1123545600,"08 9, 2005",2005,2572,"['review', 'MGM', 'DVD', 'released', '2001.The', 'movie', 'based', 'classic', 'novel', 'Herman', 'Melville', 'same', 'name', 'movie', 'narration', 'Ishmael', 'Richard', 'Basehart', 'who', 'seaside', 'town', 'New', 'Bedford', 'can', 'join', 'whaling', 'crew', 'inn', 'shares', 'bed', 'harpooner', 'South', 'Pacific', 'named', 'Queequeg', 'Friedrich', 'Ledebur', 'first', 'Ishmael', 'repulsed', 'Queequeg', 'tattoos', 'shrunken', 'head', 'room', 'soon', 'become', 'good', 'friends', 'accept', 'employment', 'whaling', 'ship', 'Pequod', 'ship', 'set', 'sail', 'meet', 'mysterious', 'ship', 'captain', 'Ahab', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'who', 'wooden', 'leg', 'previous', 'whaling', 'encounter', 'great', 'white', 'whale', 'Ahab', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'Starbuck', 'who', 'devout', 'Quaker', 'ship', 'sets', 'sail', 'Ahab', 'mission', 'clear', 'crew', 'capture', 'white', 'whale', 'named', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'movie', 'first', 'tension', 'later', 'nearly', 'outright', 'mutiny', 'Ahab', 'Starbuck', 'regarding', 'true', 'mission', 'voyage', 'moral', 'obligations', 'fellow', 'man', 'dramatic', 'ending.The', 'movie', 'many', 'strengths', 'few', 'weaknesses', 'One', 'refreshing', 'aspect', 'stood', 'out', 'how', 'much', 'dialogue', 'dealt', 'God', 'man', 'Christian', 'beliefs', 'Discussions', 'such', 'have', 'now', 'become', 'pretty', 'much', 'taboo', 'Hollywood', 'day', 'age', 'One', 'terrific', 'scene', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Orsen', 'Wells', 'who', 'Father', 'Mapple', 'minister', 'who', 'stirring', 'sermon', 'congregation', 'Jonah', 'whale', 'are', 'certainly', 'lot', 'metaphors', 'moral', 'lessons', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'bought', 'DVD', 'can', 'watch', 'pull', 'out', 'more', 'abstract', 'meanings', 'observe', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'film', 'John', 'Huston', 'directed', 'great', 'film', 'being', 'shot', 'nearly', '20', 'years', 'movie', 'Jaws', 'convincing', 'presentation', 'whale', 'hunting.As', 'DVD', 'unrestored', 'master', 'copy', 'was', 'obviously', 'used', 'few', 'tiny', 'blemishes', 'would', 'mar', 'color', 'picture', 'quality', 'occasion', 'seemed', 'be', 'few', 'far', 'color', 'sharpness', 'were', 'not', 'today', 'standards', 'excellent', 'movie', 'old', 'audio', 'was', 'slightly', 'below', 'average', 'did', 'not', 'detract', 'significantly', 'presentation', 'story', 'DVD', 'did', 'not', 'offer', 'bonuses', 'trailer', 'making', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'bonus', 'material', 'was', 'clearly', 'technically', 'challenging', 'project', 'film', 'era.Movie', 'A-DVD', 'Quality', 'B+']",Moby Dick VHS

The image of Orson Wells as Father  Maple has stuck with me for years, as has the contents of his sermon (watch  closely at the ropes of his ladder up to the pulpit which magically detach  from the floor when he pulls the ladder after him!).  The whaling scenes  have never been beaten, but that is mostly because they have never really  been attempted properly since and suffer through age,looking very dated  indeed.  The same can be said for the sets (the 'Spouter Inn' could be on a  high-school stage set).  For this, and many other reasons, I think it is  high time that this movie be re-made using the best in modern effects, and  the finest of modern actors.

Gregory Peck does a commendable job as Captain Ahab, who is bent on revenge at killing the whale that took his leg and, for him, represents a sinister force of Nature. As one reviewer noted, Peck is able to demonstrate that there is more than one way to play a ""crazed and obsessed"" man. Ismael, the narrator, is the outside observer on the Pequod, Captain Ahab's boat. He sees the struggles of the men who try to capture several whales; he also sees how Ahab motivates his crew by painting a picture of the white whale as a symbol of ""evil"" to mankind. At one point, Ahab nails a gold doubloon to the mast and says that the one who first spots Moby Dick will be the one who gets this monetary reward. During another scene, Ahab sees the vessel illuminated when a typhoon hits it, and he sees this as a ""sign"" that he will have success in his voyage.Another noteworthy scene is Father Mapple's ""Jonah"" speech (played perfectly by Orson Wells). I thought it was such a suitable scene for the relevance of the story. The speech typifies the importance of change of character, as Mapple speaks of the way in which Jonah changed after he was swallowed by the whale (referring to the Biblical story). The story that Mapple speaks about is symbolic for the larger allegory of Ahab's pursuit of the Moby Dick.There were a few flaws with the movie, such as the repetitive chase scenes with the whale, in which we watch seemingly the same action take place. These did not deter much from the effectiveness of the Melville's story, however. The whole essence of what the Pequod represents for the crew and what the search for Moby Dick symbolize are present and accurately depicted in the film.

I am no longer a child, but I will not pretend to understand half of the things involved with Melville's Moby Dick; even the comic-book type of adaptations are complicated. This being said, however, the skeletal plot of Melville's classic is still quite intriguing, an unusual story of revenge and madness as well as nature. It is with this in mind that I comment on John Huston's masterpiece; this film version is fantastic! To label Gregory Peck as miscast is to discredit the task of acting (at least somewhat). True, Peck's version of Captain Ahab lacks the blatant fire of the written character, but his silent and brooding interpretation carries just as much obsession and passion as does the literary Ahab; indeed, I thoroughly enjoyed Ahab's portrayal in this film version. This is perhaps Mr. Peck's finest moment in his acting career. An earlier reviewer remarked on how unconvincing Frederick Ledebur is in the role of Queequeg-- I would have to disagree with that. Although Ledebur does not specifically look like a Pacific Islander in this movie, he is still quite large and swarthy, and his portrayal of Queequeg does an excellent job of conveying him as a foreigner and a mystery (who is, of course, genuinely noble at heart). In terms of appearances, Tashtego the Native American is not particularly native-looking either, but does this mean that the actor did a horrible job? Of course not; a great actor can portray other ethnic groups effectively, even if s/he does not specifically look the part. Getting back to the film itself, it is simply a beauty to look at. The oceanic imagery is very aesthetically pleasing, and the whaling scenes are fascinating; I myself always wondered how it was done, especially before modern technology. I do not specifically condone whaling other than as a means of survival, but it is nonetheless a spectacle to watch. Finally, there is the white whale itself, which is INCREDIBLY realistic-looking, and far superior in quality to any trick done by computers! Having seen whales at aquariums, the rubber whale used in Huston's film is complete with the life-like imperfections and markings found on real specimens. It is really hard to believe that Moby Dick himself, or herself, is not a living creature; even its movements and actions are incredibly life-like! Placing these great special effects together with an interesting plot and great acting make this film an excellent edition to any collection.

Yes, it's about a whale. Yes, their real, not some imagined prehistoric or alien creature, but make no mistake, this is a giant monster movie of the 10th magnitude! It is also along with ""Jaws"" & ""the Birds,"" one of the three pinnacles of nature gone awry films ever made, but ""Moby Dick"" precedes both films, ""The Birds"" (1963) by seven years, & ""Jaws"" (1975) by 19 years! If there was ever a film to make a wave, it was ""Moby Dick!Made in 1956, ""Moby Dick"" still has dazzling special effects! Truly a mammoth effort, the whale ""Moby Dick"" is at once convincing & terrifying! A true; ""Your going to need a bigger boat"" moment if there ever was one! The film is down right eerie at times, especially the birds who follow the whale, swarming like an evil omen of doom before it appears! You can smell the dread & fear of the sailors. But this movie would only be half the film, if it were not for Gregory Peck as ""Captain Ahab."" The sailors fear Ahab as much as the whale. The great actor's performance as the revenge obsessed Captain, is as black hearted, cold, & unyielding, as the great whale it's self! Both connected by revenge. The whale, for what man has done to it. Ahab, for what he misconstrues the Whale has done to him. For the whale will attack any ship that attacks it, not only as an act of survival, but an act of absolute destruction. Wiping out any chance of reprisals, the ultimate act of destroying thy enemy. Ahab's private war with the whale, is but a pale comparison to the wrath visited on any who dare hunt ""the white whale."" Yet in many ways, Ahab's obsession rivals the whales wrath, as even in death, Ahab seems to beckon the whalers to their doom. In a scene that still stands as one of the most profound ever filmed. The whalers go after ""Moby Dick after Ahab is dead, tied to the whale & his immortal fate. He motions with his arm with the whales movements, that the whalers construe as Ahab beckoning them on, even after death, for the kill. It makes you flesh goose bump, with it's maniacal totality of revenge, & perpetuating the madness of revenge amongst the surviving whalers in an act of self destruction. A powerful scene indeed!For those of you who have not seen this great film, please do so, you'll not be disappointed! For those of you that have, like myself, you will watch it, time & time again.

The film can best be understood as an visualization of a kind of Classic Comics version of the story, with most of the more difficult parts excised in favor of the adventure story. But it's an adventure story missing a protagonist; as in the novel, Ishmael (here played by Richard Basehart) absents himself for the most part after the fine introductory sequence, involving spectacular shots of New Bedford and its whalers and Father Mapple's sermon delivered with intelligence and fire by Orson Welles. Thereafter Gregory peck has to take over as Ahab, and though his characterization has been much mocked (most memorably by Pauline Kael), he's suitably demonic and has the look to him of an Old Testament patriarch. But the character can't really hold the film together. The best parts of the film are towards the end after the eponymous whale is finally sighted. At first, he appears only very partially and obscured by spray and foam; his appearance is uncannily presaged by the cawing and circling of gulls. When by the end he's racing through the surf smashing through whaleboats and ramming the Pequod with his bulk he really seems genuinely monstrous (the special effects are terrific especially considering they were done more than half a century ago).

Then you can reward yourself with this fine film adaption. I've heard others on this site criticizing  Gregory Peck's portrayal of Captain Ahab. Not his style they say. Who is Ahab anyway?. Do they have a secret insight on how the character is to be played? It's Mr. Peck's interpretation & just fine. It is a story of vengeance & Ahab's obsession with the giant white whale that disabled him & took his leg. It is also a story of death, fear of death, the after life & the power of a prophesy on god-fearing men. The Pequot, named after an almost extinct, Indian tribe is a whaler out of New Bedford in the 1840's. A time infused with rigid puritanical belief that they were doing god's work supplying light to thousands of lamps with their whale oil. The dialect/manner of speaking & attention to detail on the ship is excellent, under the direction of John Huston. So Captain Ahab is losing his tenuous grip on sanity & his agitation increases. Finally there is the confrontation with the white monster. This is a rather short movie given the grandness of the book. A fine retelling in any case.

He made the movie! Why such a talent ended up making cheesy commercials, I'll never know.Back to Peck.  Yes, he was miscast as Ahab.  He doesn't quite get the sense of insanity or evil that Ricardo Monteban (Wrath of Khan), or Anthony Hopkins (Silence of Lambs, Hannibal) convey.  You just know that Lecter really knows what he is doing is wrong, but he doesn't care, and that somehow he thinks being a cannibal is funny.  The best Peck can do is weird eye rolling along the lines of Jonathan Lithgow's Emilio Lizardo in  ""Buckaroo Banzai.""The DVD is rather skimpy on the extras-no commentaries, or any of the other extras we have come to love.

Probably the best bits were borrowed directly from the book. Nothing wrong with that of course. Also, it proved to me, you don't always need some pretty ladies for a sub-plot romance to aid the picture.On the downside, some of the acting leaves a lot to be desired. I know this will probably cause a lot of foaming at the mouth but I find Gregory Peck a very overrated actor. He was handsome and had a wonderful speaking voice but I always feel like something's missing. The way he smiles and frowns at random seemed self-conscious, like he's trying too hard. In other words, he doesn't feel 'natural' to me. He is waaaay too over the top as Captain Ahab. Okay. I know he was supposed to be a nutcase but he really needed to tone it down a few notches. Every time I see him, he's got those keeerraazzy eyes and self-conscious grimaces. He bellowed and screamed his lines and never let up. His cadence is that of a person who thinks the audience won't understand English unless it is spoken in a slow, pompous, pretentious tone--every word etched in marble. I think Orson Wells or Victor Jory (Mr. Keller in The Miracle Worker) would have been a better choice. Peck was much better playing protagonists--even though I don't understand his oscar win, To Kill a Mockingbird is still one of my favorite films.Richard Basehart is good as Ishmael but I've never seen a tremendous or outstanding performance from him. I did enjoy Orson Wells as the pastor and the actor (forgot his name) who played the jolly, tall, shaved, sailor with the tossled hat. Best of all was Leo Genn as the smooth, refined, subtle, Starbucks--the voice of common sense and reason. Starbucks was sort of like a reprise of his role in Quo Vadis. (wise, witty adviser to a madman.)The only other things I didn't like--besides Peck--was the drab, grainy, cinematography and that weird tune they sung in the church--couldn't they have found something better like ""A Mighty Fortress is our God?"" or ""O God Our Help in Ages Past?""Make no mistake.

Babe Ruth couldn't necessarily play basketball, and Carl Sagan is no novelist.As for this movie rendition of a great book, it of course falls far short of the impact the book has.Besides simply not involving me deeply in the story, the movie also fails in that it is poorly lit, and the critical scenes are obfuscated by poor lighting.

He had to change the story in order to condense it but did a masterful job of capturing the essence of Melville's novel, which was too wordy for my tastes anyway.  I was also impressed by John Huston's directing;  given the limited technical effects available in 1956, he managed to convey the turbulence of the sea, the thrill of the whale kills and he pulled fine acting performances from his cast.The cast, however, was the weak link . Gregory Peck was only 40 years old when he played the role and although he managed to capture Ahab's madness, he needed more than a streak of dyed gray hair and a phony scar on his face to convey the feeling of someone who had spent a lifetime at sea.  There were actually fewer wrinkles on his face than there were on the face of Richard Basehart, who played the role of Ishmael and was actually 42 years old at the time.  Another example of this gross miscasting was the role of Queequeq, the harpooner who was supposed to be a pacific islander.  I can't understand why the role was given to a Frederick Ledebur, a 56-year-old actor who came from Vienna; he had very light skin, a long nose and a German accent.  Also, although the crewmen might have been good actors, their bodies just didn't have the musculature that comes from hard physical labor.  Of course it was 1956 and working out at gyms wasn't in style, but I wish that the casting director had at least required what looked like physical strength.  One role, however, that was right on the mark was that of Orson Welles as Father Mapple.  He might have had only one speech, but it was an imposing one.  He looked the part and his voice had the quality of orator.That said, I did find some enjoyment in the film.  There was tension throughout and, unlike the Melville book, the story didn't ramble.

The family would watch it, ages ago, when it would come on TV, but I usually wandered away and came back in time for the dramatic sinking of the Pequod. Then, last week, I read that it was going to be shown THAT VERY NIGHT in a place called Den of Cin for [low cost]. How could I lose? So off I went.I think I may know now why the movie never seemed to hold my interest as a lilGal. It is miscast, as several of the other reviewers have pointed out, in two crucial roles. Well, at least, there OUGHT to be two crucial roles--that's part of problem number one, Richard Basehart's Ishmael. Ishmael is the narrator of the book, and one could argue that he's supposed to fall out and not be noticed as Everything Else takes place. But does that mean that the actor has to be a nonentity? Malibu Ken in the back closet could've done as well. And, you know, in the New Bedford tavern, old tars and barkeeps keep saying, ""Young feller"", ""Son"", and things like that to Basehart. Um, this guy is not young. Why is this happening? I could have understood if the part were being played by a big name actor too old to have been cast at that time, like say Monty Clift. But since Basehart was never a big star, and he wasn't any spring chicken, what gives? So that's Miscast Number One.No mystery to Miscast Number Two, Gregory Peck as Captain Ahab. After giving a good hard look at a number of Peck's performances, I really have to say that he often fails to bring anything to the table that's at all remarkable or memorable. He's tall and has a deep voice, but no where near the actor that his contemporary Kirk Douglas is. So this Ahab is passionless, though he grimaces often. One reviewer characterized this as Abe Lincoln at sea, but it's more like Silas Barnaby from Laurel and Hardy's ""March of the Wooden Soldiers""--that more exactly conveys the acting style at work here.So what makes the movie, then? Camerawork, editing, and color. The scenes where the crew are harpooning whales before Ahab gets wind of Moby Dick's whereabouts are dazzling. Exhilarating! And I had long ago heard that a special effect was used with the color. But I was told it was to resemble oil paintings, so I had expected a dark murky grainy look. Not at all! These are the light shades of early 19th century whaling prints. Nothing quite like it, before or since.Ergo, you might try weighing anchor and checking out ""Moby Dick"", but the crew's not everything they ought to be.",4,A Movie Better than Its Stars,1015286400,"03 5, 2002",2002,2528,"['years', 'finally', 'did', 'saw', 'Moby-Dick', 'own', 'volition', 'family', 'would', 'watch', 'ago', 'when', 'would', 'come', 'TV', 'usually', 'wandered', 'away', 'came', 'back', 'time', 'dramatic', 'sinking', 'Pequod', 'Then', 'last', 'week', 'read', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'shown', 'VERY', 'NIGHT', 'place', 'called', 'Den', 'Cin', '[', 'low', 'cost', ']', 'How', 'could', 'lose', 'went.I', 'think', 'may', 'know', 'now', 'why', 'movie', 'never', 'seemed', 'hold', 'interest', 'lilGal', 'miscast', 'several', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'two', 'crucial', 'roles', 'Well', 'least', 'OUGHT', 'be', 'two', 'crucial', 'roles', 'part', 'problem', 'number', 'one', 'Richard', 'Basehart', 'Ishmael', 'Ishmael', 'narrator', 'book', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'supposed', 'fall', 'out', 'not', 'be', 'noticed', 'Everything', 'Else', 'place', 'mean', 'actor', 'be', 'nonentity', 'Malibu', 'Ken', 'back', 'closet', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'as', 'well', 'know', 'New', 'Bedford', 'tavern', 'old', 'tars', 'barkeeps', 'keep', 'saying', 'Young', 'feller', 'Son', 'things', 'Basehart', 'Um', 'guy', 'not', 'young', 'Why', 'happening', 'could', 'have', 'understood', 'part', 'were', 'being', 'played', 'big', 'name', 'actor', 'too', 'old', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'time', 'say', 'Monty', 'Clift', 'Basehart', 'was', 'never', 'big', 'star', 'was', ""n't"", 'spring', 'chicken', 'what', 'Miscast', 'Number', 'One.No', 'mystery', 'Miscast', 'Number', 'Two', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Captain', 'Ahab', 'giving', 'good', 'hard', 'look', 'number', 'Peck', 'performances', 'really', 'have', 'say', 'often', 'bring', 'anything', 'table', 'remarkable', 'memorable', 'tall', 'deep', 'voice', 'where', 'actor', 'contemporary', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'So', 'Ahab', 'passionless', 'often', 'One', 'reviewer', 'characterized', 'Abe', 'Lincoln', 'sea', 'more', 'like', 'Silas', 'Barnaby', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'March', 'Wooden', 'Soldiers', 'more', 'exactly', 'acting', 'style', 'work', 'here.So', 'what', 'movie', 'then', 'Camerawork', 'editing', 'color', 'scenes', 'where', 'crew', 'are', 'harpooning', 'whales', 'Ahab', 'wind', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'whereabouts', 'are', 'dazzling', 'Exhilarating', 'had', 'long', 'ago', 'heard', 'special', 'effect', 'was', 'used', 'color', 'was', 'told', 'was', 'resemble', 'oil', 'paintings', 'had', 'expected', 'dark', 'murky', 'grainy', 'look', 'Not', 'are', 'light', 'shades', 'early', '19th', 'century', 'whaling', 'prints', 'Nothing', 'quite', 'since.Ergo', 'might', 'try', 'weighing', 'anchor', 'checking', 'out', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'crew', 'not', 'everything', 'ought', 'be']",Moby Dick VHS

It's a great film in its own right, apart from the great novel upon which it is based. The case can easily be made that this film does not 'do justice' to the book, if only for the reason that it does not cover every aspect of Melville's original. But this film proves that a slavish literary imitation is not necessary for a great film.Huston also fought with Ray Bradbury over the screenplay. The great science fiction author was literally reduced to tears by the gruff director, and he wrote a book about the experience. There was also some conflict over the casting of Gregory Peck as Ahab. Some say Orson Welles or Leo Genn (Starbuck) would have been a better choice. This may well be, but it should be admitted that Peck rises to the occasion when it's called for. The great scene with the Spanish doubloon and the great scene with Starbuck on the bridge, where Ahab explains his obsession. Few other actors are likely to have surpassed these moments.According to IMDb, MOBY DICK was shot in 1.66:1 aspect ratio. This DVD does not present the film in that ratio, yet it does not appear to be a pan & scan transfer. The film looks very good and and nothing appears to have been done to tamper with the color. This is most likely how it should look. The director fought with the studio over the color process used in MOBY DICK: it's intentional. He and the cinematographer were trying to capture a visual style that would be evocative of a period style of painting that would contribute to the mood of the story.Anyone interested in background on this film should read THE HUSTONS by Lawrence Grobel. The harrowing production is detailed, with plenty of attention given to the above-mentioned conflicts and also to the shooting of the INCREDIBLE final sequence.Some extras would have been welcome, but this DVD is more than worth owning by any fan of Melville, Huston or American film.",5,Movie=5 Stars / DVD= 4 Stars,1084320000,"05 12, 2004",2004,1950,"['John', 'Huston', 'film', 'MOBY', 'DICK', 'perhaps', 'rare', 'exception', 'great', 'film', 'own', 'right', 'apart', 'great', 'novel', 'based', 'case', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'made', 'film', 'not', ""'do"", 'justice', 'book', 'only', 'reason', 'not', 'cover', 'aspect', 'Melville', 'original', 'film', 'slavish', 'literary', 'imitation', 'not', 'necessary', 'great', 'film.Huston', 'also', 'fought', 'Ray', 'Bradbury', 'screenplay', 'great', 'science', 'fiction', 'author', 'was', 'literally', 'reduced', 'tears', 'gruff', 'director', 'wrote', 'book', 'experience', 'was', 'also', 'conflict', 'casting', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Ahab', 'say', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Leo', 'Genn', 'Starbuck', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'choice', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'should', 'be', 'admitted', 'Peck', 'occasion', 'when', 'called', 'great', 'scene', 'Spanish', 'doubloon', 'great', 'scene', 'Starbuck', 'bridge', 'where', 'Ahab', 'obsession', 'Few', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'likely', 'have', 'surpassed', 'moments.According', 'IMDb', 'MOBY', 'DICK', 'was', 'shot', '1.66:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'DVD', 'not', 'present', 'film', 'ratio', 'not', 'appear', 'be', 'pan', 'scan', 'transfer', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'nothing', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'tamper', 'color', 'most', 'likely', 'how', 'should', 'look', 'director', 'fought', 'studio', 'color', 'process', 'used', 'MOBY', 'DICK', 'intentional', 'cinematographer', 'were', 'trying', 'capture', 'visual', 'style', 'would', 'be', 'evocative', 'period', 'style', 'painting', 'would', 'contribute', 'mood', 'story.Anyone', 'interested', 'background', 'film', 'should', 'read', 'THE', 'HUSTONS', 'Lawrence', 'Grobel', 'harrowing', 'production', 'detailed', 'plenty', 'attention', 'given', 'above-mentioned', 'conflicts', 'also', 'shooting', 'INCREDIBLE', 'final', 'sequence.Some', 'extras', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'welcome', 'DVD', 'more', 'worth', 'owning', 'fan', 'Melville', 'Huston', 'American', 'film']",Moby Dick VHS

This version is superior to the more recent release with Patrick Stewart as Captain Ahab with great cinematography and good acting.Although some have complained about Gregory Peck's performance as Captain Ahab, I feel that his cold reserved expressions in the film work just as well in showing a man consumed by hatred and a lust for revenge.  In line with Melville's extremely religious themes, the character of Ahab is a man who feels he's been cheated by nature and God and so seeks his revenge. Taking his doomed men with him around the world, he seeks to exact his vengeance on the great white whale who took his leg, Moby Dick.  The sailor Ishmael (Richard Basehart) is the voice of innocence and redemption.The direction and cinematography is superb.

Other blunders (shrunken heads come from the j&iacute;baros in South America, not from Polynesian tribes; sperm whales upper jaws have no teeth since they only eat plankton, not humans; whales are not fishes, etc) are to be blamed on Melville himself.Several scenes would be considered too politically incorrect today, such as whalers harpooning their bloody prey for real, or an African American kid being crushed to death by a fallen mast. Some, like the one with the Pequod leaving New Bedford, are breathtakingly beautiful. As for the Great White Whale itself, it's amazing how well made it was back in 1956.

406898,A21VR7M8O55EF6,6304196911,Robin Friedman,"[2, 2]","Written in 1851,  Herman Melville's difficult, tormented novel has inspired a long stream of American creative effort. Among the most recent of these efforts is the opera &#34;Moby-Dick&#34; by Jake Heggie with libretto by Gene Scheer that I saw and reviewed here on Amazon in an outstanding DVD by the San Francisco Opera. The new opera prompted me to visit an earlier famous adaptation of &#34;Moby-Dick&#34; : director John Huston's film version of 1956. Amazon's &#34;instant video&#34; rental feature made it easy to get to know the film. I also used George Cotkin's study of &#34;Moby-Dick&#34; in American culture, &#34;Dive Deeper: Journeys with Moby-Dick&#34;  (2012) to supplement watching the movie.John Huston (1906 -- 1987) was a flamboyant American film director and screenwriter who directed many classic films beginning with 1941's &#34;The Maltese Falcon&#34;. Although he had difficulty reading the book, Huston had long wanted to make a movie of &#34;Moby-Dick&#34;, and he enlisted the science fiction writer Ray Bradbury to write the script. Bradbury too had experienced difficulty reading Melville's novel, but he took to the project enthusiastically.  He and Huston had a stormy relationship with each other, but both immersed themselves in the book and the project. As George Cotkin tells it in &#34;Dive Deeper&#34;, Bradbury struggled with the script but ultimately had an epiphany, proclaiming &#34;I am Herman Melville&#34; when he realized that Ahab in the book  &#34;wants the mens' souls&#34;  as well as revenge against the white whale.  For Huston's part, Cotkin describes him as &#34;devoted to making his film and having it touched with blasphemy, veracity, and cinematic splendor&#34;. Huston revised Bradbury's script.  According to Cotkin, &#34; Huston had wanted Bradbury's soul.  He managed to get a good film script that he reworked until it fit his own vision of a man bent on diving deeper, confronting a God who had questions to answer.&#34;Huston's film captures the &#34;blasphemy&#34; he sought as his Ahab rails against the suffering and lost dreams of human life and against the God he holds responsible. Bradbury's script too shows a charismatic Ahab who has the power to convince his crew of the importance of his vendetta against the whale and to persuade them to follow him. Bradbury's script has a great deal of the majestic, raving quality of Melville.  Although the film departs from the novel in several important ways, partly to take account of the different nature of the mediums, it captures a great deal of the spirit and themes of the original. The movie also succeeds in Huston's goal of providing &#34;cinematic splendor&#34; to the telling of the tale. The film was an expensive spectacular, with unique and effective coloration, scenes of the ocean and the Pequod, and a lush score. The most lavish and famous scene in the movie was the climactic portrayal of the white whale and of Ahab's and his crews doomed pursuit towards the end, as the whale carries Ahab off on his back, with the ocean broiling and the birds flying ominously overhead.There are issues with the acting and casting of the film. Gregory Peck does not have the full visceral passion to capture Ahab. He appears in this film looking somewhat like a well-dressed Abraham Lincoln and his performance is restrained.  Late in life, Peck portrayed Father Mapple in another screen version of &#34;Moby-Dick&#34; and he frequently spoke with dissatisfaction about his performance of Ahab in the earlier film.  Still, many viewers have got to know Ahab through Peck, and his effort deserves respect.As for the rest of the cast,  full-voiced Richard Basehart is a capable Ishmael and the German actor of aristocratic background, Friedrich von Ledebur, overcomes the odd casting to be effective as Queequeg.  Leo Genn captures the common sense of Starbuck, but the acting gem of this film is Orson Welles in his performance of Father Mapple, whose sermon sets the stage both for the novel and for the movie. According to Cotkin, Welles took to the role of Father Mapple immediately and extemporized on the sermon during the filming.  &#34;That's very good, very good indeed&#34;, Huston commented. &#34;But now try it as written in the script.&#34;Huston's film, like Melville's novel, failed commercially upon its initial release, but its reputation has continued to grow. Over the years, many people have come to the story and its characters through the portrayals in this movie. Huston's film with its flaws thus has taken on something of a life of its own.Huston's film is worth seeing and enjoying in it own right for what it is. I enjoyed watching the movie as a sort of commentary on the book.  It is one of a long series of illustrious examples of how Americans over the years have approached and thought about Melville's literary masterwork.Robin Friedman",4,John Huston's Moby

This is my substitute for pistol and ball.""So it begins...Ray Bradbury's first Hollywood job, as screenwriter, and what a job he did! This is, far and away, the finest translation of this unique and wonderful story, by Herman Melville, taken from the true account of the whaleship ""Essex."" The only time in Maritime records of a whale deliberately ramming a ship! Richard Basehart is a low-key and very convincing Ishmael, Orson Welles, brilliant as the Preacher in his curious pulpit fashioned after a whaling ship, and ascended via a rope ladder... and Queequeg is magnificent, an exotic creaure, replete with unusual tattooed designs all over his face, and seldom without his unique pipe. Quite a memorable character...Gregory Peck is great as Ahab, and does a wholly convincing job of potraying the tortured Captain of the Pequod, pacing ominously up and down the deck, on his stump, fashioned from the jawbone of a whale, planning his revenge on the ""damn-ed whale."" His stentorian tones, and the portent with which he delivers his lines, is something to watch... Pip the cabin boy, is great with his tambourine and his joy at being at sea with the whaling men; what an adventure! When the Pequod sets out to sea, the women of the town look on, grief, sorrow and resignation etched in their faces, and then the mood lightens when the men sing as they work on the ship. And my favorite lines from Elijah...(paraphrasing)""There'll come a day at sea, when you'll smell land and there'll be no land, and all, all save one, shall perish."" The adventures at sea, and the byplay between the crew, and the obvious affection and respect and awe they all feel for Ahab; wonderful stuff, and this affection eventually dooms them to follow him to their ultimate fate and encounter with Moby Dick. The effects are superb, even by today's standards, and the acting unparalleled. You will smell the salt water and feel the wind on your face when you watch this, the ultimate movie interpretation of Moby Dick.Ahab's stirring words to the crew, revealing his true intent on this voyage...""Whosoever of ye raises me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw; whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with three holes punctured in his starboard fluke- look ye, whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys!""""Huzza! huzza!"" cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast.""It's a white whale, I say,"" resumed Ahab, as he threw down the topmaul: ""a white whale. Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for white water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out.""""Captain Ahab,"" said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. ""Captain Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick- but it was not Moby Dick that took off thy leg?""""Who told thee that?"" cried Ahab; then pausing, ""Aye, Starbuck; aye, my hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye,"" he shouted with a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose; ""Aye, aye! it was that accursed white whale that razeed me; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!"" Then tossing both arms, with measureless imprecations he shouted out: ""Aye, aye! and I'll chase him round Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round perdition's flames before I give him up. And this is what ye have shipped for, men! to chase that white whale on both sides of land, and over all sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out. What say ye, men, will ye splice hands on it, now?

406906,AS27SJQFMATT8,6304196911,Shakespeare,"[0, 5]","Because you DO want to have an excellent film of Moby Dick, you buy this one as best overall production and cast . . . with the notorious exception of Gregory Peck as Ahab. After Walter Houston died without John Houston's being able to make the film before 1956, and because studio financing specifically demanded a ""name"" ""mainstream"" (read ""non-classically trained"" and ""non-Shakespearean,"") John Houston shamefully seduced a fine but limited American adventure star, Gregory Peck, into taking on a role equivalent to Shakespeare's King Lear -- for which Peck was completely unsuited and uncomfortable. Ahab is not Atticus Finch; even Father Mapple is dimensions beyond Atticus Finch. And Atticus Finch in To Kill A Mockingbird was the most complex acting Peck ever did. Was not John Houston's own name sufficient to serve as Ahab. He would have been excellent. And Orson Welles -- playing Father Mapple in a short character scene as if descended from the Sistine Chapel Ceiling to demonstrate why he should have been Ahab. Welles' performance you never forget. Peck's performance you unfortunately cannot forget, it is so wrong, so annoying, postured, insincere and totally confused. John Houston's quest to make this Moby Dick was as badly timed and ill-fated as Ahab's Proud, Final, Futile Hatred. Jack Aranson from the Old Vic did a filmed one-man show of Moby Dick available still on dvd which blows Peck, and Houston, and Welles away . . . because he has trained all his life for such a character role. There IS no ""bigger character role"" in film, perhaps even in literature, than Captain Ahab.I have not yet had the pleasure of reading the biographies cited by other reviewers cataloging everyone's disappointment over this Adventure of the Titanic -- how and why she hit at least a dozen icebergs intentionally, then like Ahab kept going for the ultimate annihilation pride will bring. Regardless of studio pressure, and especially with Ray Bradbury ready to translate Shakespearean heroics into shallow psychological dysfunctions within a meaningless universe, a better Ahab could be found on every movie lot and certainly in the American and British theater. Of course Olivier was at peak power in 1956; Charles Laughton played Ahab thrillingly on radio, a performance every lover of Moby Dick should hear; Barrymore had shown twice on film how to create original characterization for Ahab. Just consider all the spectacular character actors available in 1956. Boris Karloff had just triumphed in Leonard Bernstein's Peter Pan; Christopher Lee was chewing scenery in Transylvania; Ralph Richardson WAS arguably Ahab when he pulled out all the stops; Miche&aacute;l MacLiamm&oacute;ir and Hilton Edwards towered in theatrical heroics in film and on the Irish stage. What WAS WRONG in this miscasting was the categorical dismissal of great CHARACTER ACTORS in favor of limited Romantic Stars, ""Method"" Stars to boot, which is as far from Melville as a director could reach. Houston always thought he could ""make"" an actor play a role well by ""showing him how to do it."" Then of course no actor was John Houston, no actor knew what he was doing in the context of this film as Houston did, no actor had lighting and set and special effects in mind when he tried to ""play Houston."" Peck is completely humiliated by this casting, stupid for not dropping out.I am serious when I say that a big 1950's adventure film could have succeeded with someone like Karloff at the helm. The problem of course is that no one involved in the project, from Houston down, really read and understood Moby Dick. No one was ready to throw real good and evil around, to pit man against God, to purposely confuse all right and wrong  . . . and to use SYMBOLS, which Melville used in every one of some 150+ Chapters of Moby Dick in which ""Plot"" is secondary. If you are going to take on obsession and universal conflict, THAT is your plot: it is a fundamental, never-absent. You feel Ahab's stiff proud frame cracking with every crack in the Pequod.A final note, perhaps gratuitous but I think necessary. Patrick Stewart turns in a performance of Ahab that is unbelievably WORSE than Peck. Stewart is a shallow presence, however fine his vocal training. He may have a brain and even a soul, but I could not prove it by his Moby Dick or any other work he has done. So DO buy the Houston-Peck-Welles version if you have any temptation to get a dvd of Moby Dick and think Patrick Stewart is a good actor.

Courtney ""just a guy who loves movies""","[8, 8]","After having both navigated the treacherous waters of Melville's book and signed on to John Huston's cinematic voyage, there is only one conclusion an old salt can come to - John Huston was a genius.  The screenplay he created with Ray Bradbury stands as perhaps the greatest adaptation of a work I've read/seen.  Not that it is completely faithful to the letter of the book, but more to the spirit.  The book is immense, it meanders marvelously as the story of an obsessive Captain unfolds, as the history of whaling and the legends of whalers are told.  It is a classic, there is no doubt, but its length, breadth, and depth are as immense as the leviathan itself.  To make a movie of it would take strength, fortitude, courage, divine guidance, and perhaps a touch of black magic.  The way Huston and Bradbury make memorable scenes from Melville's raw material is amazing - from the foreshadowing speech of a madman to the conquering of Saint Elmo's fire, to the circling birds at the end.  Huston the writer and Huston the director have forged the weapons to smite the whale and give life to a time long past, in a movie the likes of which we may never see again.
