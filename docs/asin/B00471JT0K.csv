Yes, I noticed that some of the sound quality ain't great, but I haven't noticed the washed-out colors some people comment on, and in fact the Wave has been cleaned up substantially compared to some earlier seasons. Yes, the packaging is chintzy, especially compared to earlier seasons, and the Danny pic on the back of the set is awful!!BUT! I'm in it for the stories, and there are some really good ones in this season. The writers and actors gave us reasons to care about some of these folks in very little time - the reporter in Cop on the Cover, the washed-up astronaut in Shake Hands... the screwed-up cop in Ninth Step, the appealing and complex terrorist in Up the Rebels.  There are some great plot turns and twists as well, and of course Chin Ho's farewell. There are some dog episodes too (Short Walk on the Longshore), but I think the stories in this season were overall better than Season 9.It's been interesting to compare the original Five-0 to the new series - I still don't care about the principal characters in the rehash (tho' Danny comes closest, espcially when he protests McGarret's completely unrealistic, out-of-control black-ops tactics and behaviour - they're like a married couple in that car). They certainly haven't made me care about any of the guest characters (except maybe the snitch who wanted to see his family again); there've been no ""gotcha"" or ""didn't see THAT coming"" moments or stories, and the enhanced false colors of the scenic shots is really annoying. Maybe Paramount cheaped out again on the release of the original Five-0; but I know which DVDs I will buy and which version of Five-0 I will be watching in x years, on my hopelessly primitive and outdated technology. It's the stories the make it worthwhile.",4,I'm in it for the stories - and they're still pretty good!,1294617600,"01 10, 2011",2011,1897,"['Ok', 'up', 'front', 'have', '4', 'year', 'old', 'non-HD', '38', 'screen', 'TV', 'extra', 'sound', 'system', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'generally', 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'DVD', 'blu', 'ray', 'Yes', 'noticed', 'sound', 'quality', 'ai', ""n't"", 'great', 'have', ""n't"", 'noticed', 'washed-out', 'colors', 'people', 'comment', 'fact', 'Wave', 'been', 'cleaned', 'up', 'substantially', 'compared', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Yes', 'packaging', 'chintzy', 'especially', 'compared', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Danny', 'pic', 'back', 'set', 'awful', ""'m"", 'stories', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'ones', 'season', 'writers', 'actors', 'gave', 'reasons', 'care', 'folks', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'reporter', 'Cop', 'Cover', 'washed-up', 'astronaut', 'Shake', 'Hands', 'screwed-up', 'cop', 'Ninth', 'Step', 'appealing', 'complex', 'terrorist', 'Rebels', 'are', 'great', 'plot', 'turns', 'twists', 'as', 'well', 'course', 'Chin', 'Ho', 'farewell', 'are', 'dog', 'episodes', 'too', 'Short', 'Walk', 'Longshore', 'think', 'stories', 'season', 'were', 'overall', 'better', 'Season', '9.It', 'been', 'interesting', 'compare', 'original', 'Five-0', 'new', 'series', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'principal', 'characters', 'rehash', 'tho', 'Danny', 'closest', 'espcially', 'when', 'McGarret', 'completely', 'unrealistic', 'out-of-control', 'black-ops', 'tactics', 'behaviour', ""'re"", 'married', 'couple', 'car', 'certainly', 'have', ""n't"", 'made', 'care', 'guest', 'characters', 'maybe', 'snitch', 'who', 'wanted', 'see', 'family', 'again', ""'ve"", 'been', 'gotcha', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'moments', 'stories', 'enhanced', 'false', 'colors', 'scenic', 'shots', 'really', 'annoying', 'Maybe', 'Paramount', 'cheaped', 'out', 'again', 'release', 'original', 'Five-0', 'know', 'DVDs', 'will', 'buy', 'version', 'Five-0', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'x', 'years', 'hopelessly', 'primitive', 'outdated', 'technology', 'stories', 'make']",Hawaii Five-O: Season 10

However, I think it has more to do with the way it was filmed and not necessary a horrible re-mastering job. So many think because the early seasons came across well then the later seasons should too. However, not all seasons were filmed the same way. Using that logic, one would think because 'Gone With The Wind' and 'Wizard Of Oz' were so well filmed in the late '30's than all movies should come out beautiful.All in all, I was a bit surprised at how much I liked this season.

1388035,A7QNV4G4DXMQL,B00471JT0K,H50 1.0 FOREVER,"[16, 21]","I've been reading some of the negative reviews. Although I agree that the quality of remastering really fell short with this season, the episodes, themselves, are excellent - and that is why we are buying these DVDs.Right now, I'm watching the seasons in reverse. I started with Season 10 and now am watching Season 5. Quite frankly, I prefer the later seasons. They are different from the earlier seasons in that they delve into deeper topics and take a more scholarly approach than the earlier seasons. For example, ""Frozen Assets"" delves into the issue of cryogenics, which was new and of considerable interest when the episode was filmed. Guest actors are allowed to showcase their special talents. Who could play the ""nosey old biddy"" better than Mildred Natwick? No one! Just as Helen Hays reprised her Ada Quonset-type character from ""Airport"" in ""Retire in Sunny Hawaii - Forever"" (Season 8), Mildred Natwick reprised her Beatrice McMillan (McMillan & Wife) character in ""Frozen Assets.""I find it interesting that people say each season was the last of the good ones. Then, another season is released, and they retract their earlier words and say this one is the best. Well, they're all good, just in different ways. And they had to change. After all, the times changed dramatically between 1968 and 1980. The things people were interested in changed greatly. We lost our innocence with Vietnam and Watergate and no longer wanted simply to be entertained by television. We wanted to be made to think. Too, television technology advanced greatly during those years. No longer were sets dull and boring sets of cheap furniture set against hospital-green walls. Viewers wanted sets to look like real rooms. The changes go on and on.And, of course, we could only watch McGarrett run up the palace steps a certain number of times without wanting to change the channel. In the later seasons, McGarrett became more ""real."" He enjoyed a Sunday sail, played golf with real-life Honolulu Mayor Frank Fasi, learned to play tennis... In short, he stopped being the stiff and rigid ex-intelligence officer who had no time for anything but his work, and he began learning how to live life. At the same time, he aged and began to move more slowly. Yet, he held onto his moral beliefs. In fact, he became more outspoken on such issues as gun control.We learned a great deal from Five-0 on issues that were crucial in those days. We learned about airport security after hijackings caused scanners and x-ray machines to be placed in airports. We learned about art theft after several notable pieces of art were stolen around the world. We learned about counterfeiting as a means of bringing down a world power. Throughout the 12 seasons, we received quite a liberal education.So, while restoration / remastering is sorely lacking, let's not discourage CBS / Paramount from releasing Seasons 11 and 12. Five-0 is not just an individual season. It is a compendium and needs to be saved intact - all 12 seasons. It is a textbook as much, if not more, than it is entertainment.",5,Fantastic Storylines and Characters!,1302825600,"04 15, 2011",2011,3063,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'reading', 'negative', 'reviews', 'agree', 'quality', 'remastering', 'really', 'fell', 'short', 'season', 'episodes', 'are', 'excellent', 'why', 'are', 'buying', 'DVDs.Right', 'now', ""'m"", 'watching', 'seasons', 'reverse', 'started', 'Season', '10', 'now', 'am', 'watching', 'Season', '5', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'prefer', 'later', 'seasons', 'are', 'different', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'delve', 'deeper', 'topics', 'take', 'more', 'scholarly', 'approach', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'example', 'Frozen', 'Assets', 'issue', 'cryogenics', 'was', 'new', 'considerable', 'interest', 'when', 'episode', 'was', 'filmed', 'Guest', 'actors', 'are', 'allowed', 'showcase', 'special', 'talents', 'Who', 'could', 'play', 'nosey', 'old', 'biddy', 'better', 'Mildred', 'Natwick', 'one', 'Just', 'Helen', 'Hays', 'reprised', 'Ada', 'Quonset-type', 'character', 'Airport', 'Retire', 'Sunny', 'Hawaii', 'Forever', 'Season', '8', 'Mildred', 'Natwick', 'reprised', 'Beatrice', 'McMillan', 'McMillan', 'Wife', 'character', 'Frozen', 'Assets', 'find', 'interesting', 'people', 'say', 'season', 'was', 'last', 'good', 'ones', 'Then', 'season', 'released', 'retract', 'earlier', 'words', 'say', 'one', 'best', 'Well', ""'re"", 'good', 'just', 'different', 'ways', 'had', 'change', 'times', 'changed', 'dramatically', '1968', '1980', 'things', 'people', 'were', 'interested', 'changed', 'greatly', 'lost', 'innocence', 'Vietnam', 'Watergate', 'no', 'longer', 'wanted', 'simply', 'be', 'entertained', 'television', 'wanted', 'be', 'made', 'think', 'Too', 'television', 'technology', 'advanced', 'greatly', 'years', 'No', 'longer', 'were', 'sets', 'dull', 'boring', 'sets', 'cheap', 'furniture', 'set', 'hospital-green', 'walls', 'Viewers', 'wanted', 'sets', 'look', 'real', 'rooms', 'changes', 'go', 'on.And', 'course', 'could', 'only', 'watch', 'McGarrett', 'run', 'up', 'palace', 'certain', 'number', 'times', 'wanting', 'change', 'channel', 'later', 'seasons', 'McGarrett', 'became', 'more', 'real', 'enjoyed', 'Sunday', 'sail', 'played', 'golf', 'real-life', 'Honolulu', 'Mayor', 'Frank', 'Fasi', 'learned', 'play', 'tennis', 'short', 'stopped', 'being', 'stiff', 'rigid', 'ex-intelligence', 'officer', 'who', 'had', 'time', 'anything', 'work', 'began', 'learning', 'how', 'live', 'life', 'same', 'time', 'aged', 'began', 'move', 'more', 'slowly', 'held', 'moral', 'beliefs', 'fact', 'became', 'more', 'outspoken', 'such', 'issues', 'gun', 'control.We', 'learned', 'great', 'deal', 'Five-0', 'issues', 'were', 'crucial', 'days', 'learned', 'about', 'airport', 'security', 'hijackings', 'caused', 'scanners', 'x-ray', 'machines', 'be', 'placed', 'airports', 'learned', 'art', 'theft', 'several', 'notable', 'pieces', 'art', 'were', 'stolen', 'world', 'learned', 'about', 'counterfeiting', 'means', 'bringing', 'down', 'world', 'power', '12', 'seasons', 'received', 'quite', 'liberal', 'education.So', 'restoration', 'remastering', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'let', 'not', 'discourage', 'CBS', '/', 'Paramount', 'releasing', 'Seasons', '11', '12', 'Five-0', 'not', 'just', 'individual', 'season', 'compendium', 'be', 'saved', 'intact', '12', 'seasons', 'textbook', 'much', 'not', 'more', 'entertainment']",Hawaii Five-O: Season 10

Stephen Boyd, Jean Simmons, Rossano Brazzi, Geraldine Page, Carol Lynley, Lucianna Paluzzi, Eleanor Parker, and Peter Lawford are just some of the acting heavyweights who graced the stories from the 77-78 season.  Other actors who were just a few years away from stardom include Kurt Russell, Vic Tayback, Gil Girard, and Michael Conrad.And two-time Bond girl Maud Adams guests as a murderous leader of a conspiracy to infiltrate America's naval forces.Series regular Richard Denning as the ""Governor"" gets much screen time this year, even getting referred to by his rarely-heard first name in an discussion with Jack Lord's McGarrett.The season ends on a downer with the appropriately-titled ""A Death in the Family"" which sees the demise of a longtime cast member.

1388049,A17FLIUHSEQC8D,B00471JT0K,"S. Ward ""stephengward""","[14, 17]","As it stands, I've randomly watched three of the 24 episodes on this set. First the positives - the three shows I've watched, 'Up The Rebels', 'Frozen Assets' and 'Deep Cover' have all been very good - in fact, much better than I was expecting. This was surprising because, in general, Season Ten is widely regarded as the 'jump the shark' season i.e. the first complete season in which the number of average or below average episodes outnumber the decent ones. Sure, there had been 'jump the shark' episodes before (these gained prominence circa Season Seven), but never was there a complete season in which the consensus was that it sucked. Anyway, as I say, I'm impressed thus far - ok, they're nowhere near the quality of earlier seasons, but compared to Magnum Season 1 (which I've just started watching), they're excellent and even when compared to a number of episodes from Mannix Season 3, Season 10 of Five-0 more than holds its own.Now, the negatives - this set is by far and away the worst of the ten DVD releases thus far. Whilst I may have only watched three complete episodes, I've skimmed through all the rest. Many episodes are washed out and lack definition - colours are dull and there is noise which is highly visible. Ironically, one of the better 'remastered' episodes is 'Deep Cover' now compare that to some of the worse, such as 'You Don't See Many Pirates These Days' and you'll see the inconsistencies within the set. As a result, many of these episodes look older than those from its Season One counterpart (which were made ten years earlier).The sound on these discs is also hit and miss - sadly more miss than hit. 'Up The Rebels', for example, contains a distracting background noise in certain scenes and, be prepared to turn the volume to high just to attain a 'comfortable' level of sound akin to regular DVD sets.So, in comparison to earlier Five-0 releases, its questionable as to whether any 'remastering' actually has been undertaken (although the back of the set states it has..). That said, I've seen far worse so called re-mastering - check out the European Releases of Kojak Seasons 2 & 3 for that 'experience'.
