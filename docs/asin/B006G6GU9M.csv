Events happen that challenge us to &#34;suck it up&#34; and make the best of it.  Our main character gets served a raw deal.  His father comes home from his tour in the military and moves the family across the country.  Our warrior was a star LaCrosse player on his former team, but now is bottom man and only gets a chance at the team because his father is a legacy.  His whole future is on the line, but his new teammates feel they earned their places on the team and are not willing to take a step back to give the new guy a chance.  Their futures are on the line, too.  Battles happen on and off the field - until a true warrior steps in and gives him a whole new outlook on the game.

There are a lot of fluffy films set in schools, set in military schools, set in prep schools, but this film wants to navigate past most stereotypes to try to get to the core of how does a person in pain get in touch with their pain enough to grow. There are many key points made throughout in this film through the characters choices, and circumstances the characters are placed in. The film does not hammer the viewer over the heard with historical stereotypes, but tries to find a middle ground for personal growth of everyone concerned in the story. I would like to see more of Adam Beach's story, more of his character's background and strength full purpose in the telling of this story. I would like to see more history of lacrosse as sacred play for healing and character building.
