1431781,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B004XC5LM8,DVD Verdict,"[3, 7]","Judge Gordon Sullivan, DVD Verdict-- Madison (Sara Roemer, Disturbia) is depressed and suicidal, and something is very wrong with her life. Although she has the help of a doctor (Elisabeth Shue, Leaving Las Vegas), Madison decides to lock herself in her apartment for thirty days to come to terms with her problems. If she can't, she'll kill herself on the thirtieth day.Waking Madison takes on a difficult and relevant topic, and it's totally understandable that writer/director Katherine Brooks would want to tackle it. It's also totally understandable that she'd want to avoid the formulaic, movie-of-the-week vibe by spicing up the visual style of the film. Brooks has a load of talent behind the camera, and Waking Madison is filled with interesting visuals, creepy shots, and a very nonlinear approach to story and look. Although the film does a fine job showing Brooks' talents, the look of the film is also its downfall. Too much of the film feels exploitative and out to shock. Not shocking in the way that the horrors of war are shocking, but more like horror-movie shocking. It's a delicate job to drive home the scary aspects of dissociation and depression without making the audience feel like it's just being presented for our titillation, which would only cheapen the suffering of those with the disorder.However, those willing to look past the sometimes-too-stylish moments of Waking Madison are in for a bit of a treat. Sarah Roemer is great as Madison, offering a tough but vulnerable take on a character who could easily have come off as unsympathetic. Elisabeth Shue continues to prove that she's underutilized as Madison's doctor. The doctor in mental patient movies is often a throwaway role, a too-good or too-bad caricature of the medical profession. Shue's Dr. Barnes is both sympathetic but not a pushover; she seems genuinely concerned for Madison and is willing to fight for her health. Some of the film's best scenes are between Shue and Will Patton, who plays Madison's father. I don't want to give away plot details, but the pair share a number of emotional moments that would be a treat to watch even if the rest of the film was a total flop.Waking Madison gets a solid DVD release. The 1.78:1 anamorphic transfer does an excellent job with the source material, which often includes scenes with lots of filters and other treatment.Full review at dvdverdict.com",4,Waking Madison is well-acted film that tackles a difficult subject,1310428800,"07 12, 2011",2011,2392,"['Judge', 'Gordon', 'Sullivan', 'DVD', 'Verdict', 'Madison', 'Sara', 'Roemer', 'Disturbia', 'depressed', 'suicidal', 'something', 'very', 'wrong', 'life', 'help', 'doctor', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Madison', 'lock', 'apartment', 'thirty', 'days', 'come', 'terms', 'problems', 'ca', ""n't"", ""'ll"", 'kill', 'thirtieth', 'day.Waking', 'Madison', 'difficult', 'relevant', 'topic', 'totally', 'understandable', 'writer/director', 'Katherine', 'Brooks', 'would', 'want', 'tackle', 'also', 'totally', 'understandable', ""'d"", 'want', 'avoid', 'formulaic', 'movie-of-the-week', 'vibe', 'spicing', 'up', 'visual', 'style', 'film', 'Brooks', 'load', 'talent', 'camera', 'Waking', 'Madison', 'filled', 'interesting', 'visuals', 'creepy', 'shots', 'very', 'nonlinear', 'approach', 'story', 'look', 'film', 'fine', 'job', 'showing', 'Brooks', 'talents', 'look', 'film', 'also', 'downfall', 'Too', 'much', 'film', 'feels', 'exploitative', 'shock', 'Not', 'shocking', 'way', 'horrors', 'war', 'are', 'shocking', 'more', 'horror-movie', 'shocking', 'delicate', 'job', 'drive', 'home', 'scary', 'aspects', 'dissociation', 'depression', 'making', 'audience', 'feel', 'just', 'being', 'presented', 'titillation', 'would', 'only', 'cheapen', 'suffering', 'disorder.However', 'willing', 'look', 'sometimes-too-stylish', 'moments', 'Waking', 'Madison', 'are', 'bit', 'treat', 'Sarah', 'Roemer', 'great', 'Madison', 'offering', 'tough', 'vulnerable', 'take', 'character', 'who', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'come', 'off', 'unsympathetic', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'prove', 'underutilized', 'Madison', 'doctor', 'doctor', 'mental', 'patient', 'movies', 'often', 'throwaway', 'role', 'too-good', 'too-bad', 'caricature', 'medical', 'profession', 'Shue', 'Dr.', 'Barnes', 'sympathetic', 'not', 'pushover', 'genuinely', 'concerned', 'Madison', 'willing', 'fight', 'health', 'film', 'best', 'scenes', 'are', 'Shue', 'Will', 'Patton', 'who', 'Madison', 'father', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'plot', 'details', 'pair', 'share', 'number', 'emotional', 'moments', 'would', 'be', 'treat', 'watch', 'even', 'rest', 'film', 'was', 'total', 'flop.Waking', 'Madison', 'solid', 'DVD', 'release', '1.78:1', 'anamorphic', 'transfer', 'excellent', 'job', 'source', 'material', 'often', 'scenes', 'lots', 'filters', 'other', 'treatment.Full', 'review', 'dvdverdict.com']",Waking Madison

Some people on here have said that they were able to figure it out, and some have said that they weren't. I can say that, for me, some of it I could see coming; and some I could not. However, these days, everything is so repetitive that I think it would basically be impossible for a movie to completely surprise me. That being said, while the ending wasn't a total surprise, I still loved it as a whole. Elisabeth Shue was terrific, as usual.

1431786,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B004XC5LM8,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 4]","Waking Madison (Katharine Brooks, 2010)Waking Madison suffers from what I call the Curse of Synchronicity that seems to descend upon Hollywood at least once a year. This is when two screenwriters, independently of one another, end up developing the same idea into different scripts and, because no one talks to anyone else in Hollywood, two different movies with strikingly similar subject matter end up getting released within months, or sometimes weeks, of one another. (The classic example: in 2000, the twin box-office flops Red Planet and Mission to Mars were released six months apart.) Katharine Brooks, the director of Loving Annabelle, got smacked with it here, with her fourth feature--but telling you what the other 2010 movie is that turns on this exact mechanism would give the game away, so that's all the farther I can go there.Not that it would be a huge spoiler here, since Waking Madison doesn't rely on that particular Big Twist(TM) taking us all the way to the ending; she's dropped hints all the way through that this isn't quite what it seems, starting with the opening scene of Madison (Disturbia's Sarah Roemer), on a videotape, telling herself that she has thirty days to figure out what's wrong with her, and that if she hasn't by the end of that time, she's going to commit suicide--and that she has recorded this tape as a reminder to herself, in case she forgets. Fast-forward--or are we flashing back?--and Madison is in the bin with the usual collection of folks who range from the problem-with-authority muscle-dyke (Taryn Manning, who shows more verve here than she has since White Oleander) to the teddy-bear-clutching, gently-rocking girl (28 Weeks Later...'s Imogen Poots), all under the care of Elizabeth Barnes (Leaving Las Vegas' Elisabeth Shue). Which is about all I can tell you without giving away that first (but not the last, as that opening scene presages) big twist--though I can tell you that Dr. Barnes takes a special interest in Madison's case that involves digging into her past and meeting her rather terrifying mother (The Aviator's Frances Conroy) and milquetoast father (Meek's Cutoff's Will Patton), who end up figuring into things when we get round to the final confrontation.Waking Madison is a movie that has a chance at getting retroactive play--it was the first film financed by Megan Ellison, the now-powerhouse producer behind Annapurna Pictures, among whose 2012 projects were two films nominated for Best Picture (Zero Dark Thirty and The Master), as well as cult favorites Lawless and Killing Them Softly. And if that's enough to get people to go back and see it, then that's enough--this is as good as, probably a bit better than, the other movie that runs along those same lines that got released in 2010, but got a lot wider of a release because it had a much, much bigger-name director at the helm. And if that nets Katherine Brooks a few more fans along the way, well, she deserves it. ***",3,Another good-if-not-great flick from Katharine Brooks.,1363996800,"03 23, 2013",2013,2960,"['Waking', 'Madison', 'Katharine', 'Brooks', '2010', 'Waking', 'Madison', 'suffers', 'what', 'call', 'Curse', 'Synchronicity', 'descend', 'Hollywood', 'least', 'once', 'year', 'when', 'two', 'screenwriters', 'independently', 'one', 'end', 'up', 'developing', 'same', 'idea', 'different', 'scripts', 'one', 'anyone', 'else', 'Hollywood', 'two', 'different', 'movies', 'strikingly', 'similar', 'subject', 'matter', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'released', 'months', 'sometimes', 'weeks', 'one', 'classic', 'example', '2000', 'twin', 'box-office', 'flops', 'Red', 'Planet', 'Mission', 'Mars', 'were', 'released', 'six', 'months', 'apart', 'Katharine', 'Brooks', 'director', 'Loving', 'Annabelle', 'got', 'smacked', 'here', 'fourth', 'feature', 'telling', 'what', 'other', '2010', 'movie', 'exact', 'mechanism', 'would', 'give', 'game', 'away', 'farther', 'can', 'go', 'there.Not', 'would', 'be', 'huge', 'spoiler', 'here', 'Waking', 'Madison', ""n't"", 'rely', 'particular', 'Big', 'Twist', 'TM', 'taking', 'way', 'ending', 'dropped', 'hints', 'way', ""n't"", 'quite', 'what', 'starting', 'opening', 'scene', 'Madison', 'Disturbia', 'Sarah', 'Roemer', 'videotape', 'telling', 'thirty', 'days', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'wrong', ""n't"", 'end', 'time', 'going', 'commit', 'suicide', 'recorded', 'tape', 'reminder', 'herself', 'case', 'Fast-forward', 'are', 'flashing', 'back', 'Madison', 'bin', 'usual', 'collection', 'folks', 'who', 'range', 'problem-with-authority', 'muscle-dyke', 'Taryn', 'Manning', 'who', 'more', 'verve', 'here', 'White', 'Oleander', 'teddy-bear-clutching', 'gently-rocking', 'girl', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'Imogen', 'Poots', 'care', 'Elizabeth', 'Barnes', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'Which', 'can', 'tell', 'giving', 'away', 'first', 'not', 'last', 'opening', 'scene', 'presages', 'big', 'twist', 'can', 'tell', 'Dr.', 'Barnes', 'special', 'interest', 'Madison', 'case', 'digging', 'past', 'meeting', 'rather', 'terrifying', 'mother', 'Aviator', 'Frances', 'Conroy', 'father', 'Meek', 'Cutoff', 'Will', 'Patton', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'figuring', 'things', 'when', 'get', 'round', 'final', 'confrontation.Waking', 'Madison', 'movie', 'chance', 'getting', 'retroactive', 'play', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'financed', 'Megan', 'Ellison', 'now-powerhouse', 'producer', 'Annapurna', 'Pictures', '2012', 'projects', 'were', 'two', 'films', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'Master', 'as', 'well', 'cult', 'Lawless', 'Killing', 'Them', 'Softly', 'enough', 'get', 'people', 'go', 'back', 'see', 'then', 'enough', 'as', 'good', 'probably', 'bit', 'better', 'other', 'movie', 'same', 'lines', 'got', 'released', '2010', 'got', 'lot', 'wider', 'release', 'had', 'much', 'much', 'bigger-name', 'director', 'helm', 'Katherine', 'Brooks', 'few', 'more', 'fans', 'way', 'well', '***']",Waking Madison

Finally reaching a breaking point, Madison (Roemer) decides the best way to control her multiple personality disorder is to lock herself in her apartment with a video camera to film what she does.  She begins to think back over her life trying to find the cause.  This is the type of movie that you watch not expecting much, and are totally taken off guard by how good it is.  The acting is actually pretty good.  Shue does a great job a playing the psychiatrist to the girls in the psych ward.  This is a very entertaining movie with a killer twist at the end that will make you want to re-watch the movie to see if you can catch the clues.  The way this movie is shot and written actually makes you almost understand what its like to have multiple personalities in the way that it never quite settles in to a comfortable rhythm, which works very well for this type of movie.
