454473,AY06HIKRT0NZF,6305209871,James Brock,"[2, 3]","Agreeing with other reviews I'd have to say that Pokemon is a good show but it seems that now even adults have noticed the topic has lost a lot of intrest. The first few two seasons are great! But just think about this. The 4Kids and the WB are going to try and release every episode on DVD, I am not sure but it seems like they would. Anyway you are going to have to pay $20 for each of these dvd's which ONLY contain 3 episodes each. Most anime DVD's start off with atleast 4 on each and then go down to 3 after getting so far into the series of the show. There are much more than 100 episodes of Pokemon. And I really don't think the show is going to be ending any time soon. There are 4 seasons so far: Indigo League, Orange League, Johto Journey, and Johto League Champion. But everyone knows that the first season could make up two seasons because of how long it was. I'm NOT putting down the show at all. I'm just saying that it would better if you have already seen the episodes to just wait for re runs because for right now the DVD's would be too expensive. If we are lucky MAYBE they'll one day make box sets. Of course there would have to be many of them but I'd wrather buy a box set for cheaper than have to buy one DVD at a time. So if you've got the money go ahead and buy them but otherwise wait until their prices lower. I guarantee you that Pokemon will be around for a long time so you don't have to buying the DVD's the day they come out.",4,Good shows but not worth the cost,1009411200,"12 27, 2001",2001,1459,"['Agreeing', 'other', 'reviews', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'Pokemon', 'good', 'show', 'now', 'even', 'adults', 'have', 'noticed', 'topic', 'lost', 'lot', 'intrest', 'first', 'few', 'two', 'seasons', 'are', 'great', 'just', 'think', '4Kids', 'WB', 'are', 'going', 'try', 'release', 'episode', 'DVD', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'Anyway', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'pay', '20', 'dvd', 'ONLY', 'contain', '3', 'episodes', 'Most', 'anime', 'DVD', 'start', 'atleast', '4', 'then', 'go', 'down', '3', 'getting', 'so', 'far', 'series', 'show', 'are', 'much', 'more', '100', 'episodes', 'Pokemon', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'show', 'going', 'be', 'ending', 'time', 'soon', 'are', '4', 'seasons', 'so', 'far', 'Indigo', 'League', 'Orange', 'League', 'Johto', 'Journey', 'Johto', 'League', 'Champion', 'everyone', 'first', 'season', 'could', 'make', 'up', 'two', 'seasons', 'how', 'long', 'was', ""'m"", 'NOT', 'putting', 'down', 'show', ""'m"", 'just', 'saying', 'would', 'better', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'episodes', 'just', 'wait', 're', 'runs', 'right', 'now', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'expensive', 'are', 'lucky', 'MAYBE', ""'ll"", 'one', 'day', 'make', 'box', 'sets', 'course', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'many', ""'d"", 'wrather', 'buy', 'box', 'set', 'cheaper', 'have', 'buy', 'one', 'DVD', 'time', 'So', ""'ve"", 'got', 'money', 'go', 'ahead', 'buy', 'otherwise', 'wait', 'prices', 'lower', 'guarantee', 'Pokemon', 'will', 'be', 'around', 'long', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'buying', 'DVD', 'day', 'come', 'out']",N/A

Ash Ketchum of Pallet Town oversleeps on his day to get his first Pokemon and gets stuck with the rebelious Pikachu instead of Charmander, Bulbasaur, or Squirtle. Team  Rocket makes theoir first appearances in the second episode. They went from  being villians in this episode to absoulte idiots. They should just abandon  trying to catch Pikachu and do something else. And Misty is the meanest  girl I've ever seen. Japanese anime fans may enjoy, but this is  lighthearted stuff.
