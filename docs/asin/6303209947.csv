Criterion might have got more out of it, but this release wouldn't do that company any shame.Damage is virtually non-existent, contrast is excellent and the image very sharp.  There is an occasional hint of grain, but this is a much better DVD transfer than I was expecting on such an inexpensive disc.  Just check out the trailer which is almost indiscernible image-wise to show what a good job they have done.The sound is mono and sounds a little thin at first but Dennis Price's beautiful narration is clear and the ear soon adjusts.All in all, a very good DVD release.",4,Good transfer of an excellent British comedy,1034812800,"10 17, 2002",2002,790,"['need', 'add', 'much', 'comments', 'excellent', 'post-war', '1949', 'British', 'black', 'comedy', ""'ll"", 'restrict', 'DVD.This', 'good', 'transfer', 'film', 'now', 'well', '50', 'years', 'old', 'Criterion', 'might', 'have', 'got', 'more', 'release', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'company', 'shame.Damage', 'virtually', 'non-existent', 'contrast', 'excellent', 'image', 'very', 'sharp', 'occasional', 'hint', 'grain', 'much', 'better', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'was', 'expecting', 'inexpensive', 'disc', 'Just', 'check', 'out', 'trailer', 'almost', 'indiscernible', 'image-wise', 'show', 'what', 'good', 'job', 'have', 'done.The', 'sound', 'mono', 'little', 'thin', 'first', 'Dennis', 'Price', 'beautiful', 'narration', 'clear', 'ear', 'soon', 'adjusts.All', 'very', 'good', 'DVD', 'release']",N/A
362938,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303209947,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Alec Guinness was probably one of the greatest actors of his, or any, generation.  That being said, he&#8217;s best known for his comedy, and for setting the standard of comedy for not only his generation but for the one we live in today.  Seeing how his complete reinvention of comedy with each new film shaped the way other comedians imitated him is remarkable.  Watching &#8216;Kind Hearts and Coronets&#8217; I couldn&#8217;t help but think of Peter Sellers or even Eddie Murphy and how they were obviously influenced by Guinness work here.That being said, I wasn&#8217;t as impressed with &#8216;Kind Hearts and Coronets&#8217; as I wanted to be.  The fact remains that there is nothing really wrong with the film and yet it never really sparked any kind of true interest from me.  Maybe it is the dry British humor, and yet I tend to love that kind of stuff.  The film felt very tepid almost, despite the obvious audacity, and at the end of the day I felt like the envelope wasn&#8217;t pushed near as far as I was promised on the outset.Still, this is a very &#8216;good&#8217; film, and it contains some great performances.  Despite playing a stuffy and unlikable character, Dennis Price does a great job of grounding the film, and while she is obviously a manipulator and a very unsavory creature, Joan Greenwood is especially effective in the film&#8217;s final frames.  Alec Guinness takes on an entire family here and pulls it all off marvelously.The plot itself is straight up brilliant.  A young successor to the dukeship, shunned from his royal family because of his mother&#8217;s choice in husband, exacts revenge when his mother is denied a burial place and so he decides to kill off every successor standing in his way of the title.  Things seem to go smoothly, until a childhood romance takes a strange turn and winds up throwing an unexpected kink in his plans.I will watch this again, and I have a feeling that on repeat viewings this will probably feel sharper and more attentive to detail.  I just expected it to bowl me over, and instead I left entertained but not head over heels.  Still, the performance and those gorgeous costumes are enough to warrant a repeat viewing, for sure!",4,"I expected a little more, but overall I&#8217;m pleased&#8230;",1387756800,"12 23, 2013",2013,2208,"['Alec', 'Guinness', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'generation', 'being', 'said', '8217', 's', 'best', 'known', 'comedy', 'setting', 'standard', 'comedy', 'not', 'only', 'generation', 'one', 'live', 'today', 'Seeing', 'how', 'complete', 'reinvention', 'comedy', 'new', 'film', 'shaped', 'way', 'other', 'comedians', 'imitated', 'remarkable', 'Watching', '8216', 'Kind', 'Hearts', 'Coronets', '8217', 'couldn', '8217', 'help', 'think', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'even', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'how', 'were', 'obviously', 'influenced', 'Guinness', 'work', 'here.That', 'being', 'said', 'wasn', '8217', 'impressed', '8216', 'Kind', 'Hearts', 'Coronets', '8217', 'wanted', 'be', 'fact', 'nothing', 'really', 'wrong', 'film', 'yet', 'never', 'really', 'sparked', 'kind', 'true', 'interest', 'Maybe', 'dry', 'British', 'humor', 'yet', 'tend', 'love', 'kind', 'stuff', 'film', 'felt', 'very', 'tepid', 'almost', 'obvious', 'audacity', 'end', 'day', 'felt', 'envelope', 'wasn', '8217', 'pushed', 'as', 'far', 'was', 'promised', 'outset.Still', 'very', '8216', 'good', '8217', 'film', 'great', 'performances', 'playing', 'stuffy', 'unlikable', 'character', 'Dennis', 'Price', 'great', 'job', 'grounding', 'film', 'obviously', 'manipulator', 'very', 'unsavory', 'creature', 'Joan', 'Greenwood', 'especially', 'effective', 'film', '8217', 'final', 'frames', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'entire', 'family', 'here', 'off', 'marvelously.The', 'plot', 'straight', 'up', 'brilliant', 'young', 'successor', 'dukeship', 'shunned', 'royal', 'family', 'mother', '8217', 's', 'choice', 'husband', 'exacts', 'revenge', 'when', 'mother', 'denied', 'burial', 'place', 'so', 'kill', 'off', 'successor', 'standing', 'way', 'title', 'Things', 'seem', 'go', 'smoothly', 'childhood', 'romance', 'strange', 'turn', 'up', 'throwing', 'unexpected', 'kink', 'plans.I', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'have', 'feeling', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'will', 'probably', 'feel', 'sharper', 'more', 'attentive', 'detail', 'just', 'expected', 'bowl', 'instead', 'left', 'entertained', 'not', 'head', 'heels', 'Still', 'performance', 'gorgeous', 'costumes', 'are', 'enough', 'warrant', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'sure']",N/A

Although Alec Guinness is constantly cited for his multiple roles, the star of the piece is undoubtedly Dennis Price, who is incomparable and impeccable in this Wildean incarnation. Few, if any, reviews seem to credit Robert Hamer and John Dighton for their utterly brilliant script and dialogue, said to be based on a novel by Roy Horniman. Perhaps I should have heard of him. There is a deep, dark and acid undercurrent of vitriolic censure of the hypocrisies of the English class system. The setting is Edwardian -- not Victorian -- England, ie some time between 1902 and 1910: the manners and mores, dress and conventions of the age will shortly be swept away by World War I. The references to women's suffrage are entirely to the point. Mr Mazzini elicits sympathy for his evil career because he, or rather his mother, has been treated so callously by the prevailing social code. Price's most passionate moments are when he remembers his mother. In fact, these are the only moments he shows any feeling at all.  There is a fleeting comment on the furnishings of the castle: the D'Ascoyne family rose to power by methods little different from those employed by the successful 10th Duke. Hence the collection of murderous weaponry, stretching back over centuries. Violence begets violence, and blood runs thicker than water. Who can tell whether the reprieved killer did not manage to retrieve his memoirs before any damage was done, and go on to eliminate the wicked little Sibella?

362940,AJDQ5EBQNDGLF,6303209947,Bob L,"[4, 5]","I can only comment on the movie itself for I don't own it as of yet but I've seen it more than a dozen times on the big screen and the telly. Having seen it so many times I know there are no issues about the quality of prints available to Criterion and considering the kind of job they do in general it will undoubtly be exceptionally fine viewing.It's sad to think that most of today's audience only know the late Sir Alec Guinness as Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi it being one of, if not the most, mundane of his screen roles. He despised it even though his two points made him very well off. It was not one of the roles for which he was knighted.His performance in Kind Hearts and Coronets was most certainly one the elements behind his knighthood. It was a loving but most pointed jab at English aristocracy. He played the eight members of the D'Ascoyne family targeted by Louis Mazzini-D'Ascoyne. The eight performances are beautifully drawn and establish each character in amazing brevity. As each are introduced they are almost immediately ""dispatched"" so to have each be so well developed in such a short time is a real achievement and testament to Guinness' acting genius.Dennis Price plays Louis in a beautifully understated performance. Louis' mother is a descendant of the D'Ascoynes but is no longer recognized by the family as one due to her marriage to an ""Italian"" singer, which is viewed to be beneath her station. Thus, she and their subsequent issue, Louis, are estranged from their aristocratic lineage. Louis' mother does not take it to heart and schools Louis in all finery and manners that would have been due him. She makes sure he understands that he a person of position. When she passes her only wish is to be interred in the family crypt. When Louis inquires to the Duke as to his mother's wish he is rudely rebuffed. At this Louis decides to claim his right of birth, the Dukedom of Chalfont. Only eight things stand in his way and they're all played by Alec Guinness. Never has a mass murderer ever been so charmingly cool.There is a wide array of deaths befitting Guinness' wide array of characterizations. Considering the subject matter, it is all very mannered and draws a substantial amount of its humor from this paradox. It easily makes my top 100 comedies but far more importantly has been honored by Time's 100 all time greatest and the same from BFI. Over the years it may have loss some of its blackness but none of its irony or humor. All the elements supporting cast, score and all technical aspects are unquestionably top drawer. Simply put this is one of the finest films ever made.I went to Wikipedia to help write this review and found they reviewed it from beginning to the very end with zero concern about spoiling it for anyone who may not have seen it.

Slipman,"[2, 3]","Robert Hamer's delightful dry and witty comedy ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" commences with the current Duke of Chalfont penning his memoirs in prison on the eve of his execution.  The film goes on to recount the events that caused him to be in this predicament.The Duke whose actual name was Louis Mazzini, was the product of a scorned marriage between his mother, a member of the aristocratic D'Ascoyne family and an Italian opera singer.  Spurned by the powerful family, Mazzini, played superbly by the genteel and urbane Dennis Price was outraged with the undignified manner in which his beloved mother was treated upon her death.  While Mazzini was tenth in line for accension to the dukedom controlled by the D'Ascoyne family, he was determined to eliminate those standing in his way.The remarkable Alec Guinness played eight separate roles as the various members of the D'Ascoyne family including the duke, a general, an admiral and the Lady Agatha.  One by one Mazzini would gain the confidence of one family member and then would murder them.  Meanwhile Mazzini was rejected for marriage by long time friend the privileged Sibella played by Joan Greenwood.  She went on to marry the son of a rich man, Lionel Holland, the result being a loveless, empty marriage.  Sibella and Mazzini became involved in a lengthy secret intimate relationship.The determined Mazzini's status was rising in the family as he continued to dispose of those standing in his way.  He became smitten with Edith D'Ascoyne played by the patrician Valerie Hobson, wife and widow of one of the disposed family members. He offered his hand in marriage to her after a suitable period of mourning.  Mazzini now had only one descendent standing in his way, the kindly duke himself.  Mazzini who had been the duke's personal secretary was now offered a partnership in the duke's business.  At the same time Hobson consented to the marriage.  Mazzini was contacted by Sibella's husband Lionel and in a business meeting revealed that he was broke.  Despondent, he asked for money and when Mazzini declined, he threatened to commit suicide and then unsucceessfully attacked him with a knife.Mercifully for Mazzini, the duke was stricken with a stroke and eventually succumbed.  With relief, he finally achieved his title.  At the ceremony he was shocked by a visit from Scotland Yard implicating him in the death of Lionel, a death he had no responsibility for.  He ultimately was convicted but Sibella offered him a chance for salvation.The perfect ending topped off what was a sterling typically British example of excellence in filmmaking.  The acting performances by Price and Guinness were superb and well supported by Hobson and Greenwood.

This classic black comedy is blessed with excellent acting by Dennis Price and Alec Guinness, as well as some very inventive murders and wry dialogue.A young lady of the D'Ascoyne family was ostracized when she married an Italian singer (he dropped dead when their son was born). Louis (Price) was raised hearing all about his noble relatives, but ignored by them -- and when his mother is refused burial at the family plot, and his devious girlfriend Sibella (Joan Greenwood) spurns him for a rich, dull man, he decides to become the next Duke.To do that, he has to kill off several relatives, which he does in various ingenious ways. He's also wooing the widow of one such murdered relative, the kindly Edith (Valerie Hobson), while still frisking with Sibella. But you can't commit six murders -- no matter how clever -- without raising some suspicions, and soon Louis finds himself a Duke on death row... but is there a way out?The whole story is told in flashback, as Louis writes his memoirs in his cell, and there's only a little bit after the memoirs' completion that explains what happened next. But from the first moments onward (the executioner getting excited about the ""privilege"" of hanging a duke), it's pretty obvious that ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" has a rare, wicked sense of humor.Much of that is through the irony (Louis is morally opposed to hunting, but not murder) and brilliantly dark dialogue (""I shot an arrow in the air; she fell to earth in Berkeley Square""). One of the best things is Louis' narration -- we learn that he's intelligent, droll, and as much of a snob as his richer relatives.But there's also the great ways in which the D'Ascoynes expire -- exploding labs, drifting boats, shooting down a hot air balloon with an arrow, and a battleship that goes the wrong way and crashes into ANOTHER battleship. A string of murders might normally be dull, but Robert Hamer keeps the wry humor in everything Louis does.Price does a simply brilliant job as Louis, a poor relation who uses charm, intelligence, pleasant lies, kindness and some disguises to murder his relatives (many of whom are much kindlier than he). Only crackly-voiced Greenwood is as wonderfully amoral as he. And Guinness showed his versatility by playing all the D'Ascoyne relatives -- the dotty vicar, a rather ugly suffragette, a pigheaded admiral, and others.""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" is a brilliantly dark comedy, with some great acting from Guinness and Price, a twisted sense of humor, and a great finale.

362950,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,6303209947,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[4, 4]","KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS (a/k/a NOBLESSE OBLIGE, Writ./Dir. Robert Hamer, 1949, 106 minutes) in short is about a noblewoman (Audrey Fildes in a sadly tiny bit part) who is ousted from her powerful noble family (the D'Ascoyne Family) for marrying an Italian commoner. Their son, Louis Mazzini (Dennis Price), witnesses the death of his father at an early age; the total rejection of his mother by her family contributes to her death. Their refusal to allow her to be buried in the family vault leads to a pauper's burial.It is then that her son vows revenge--and inheriting the title in the process. Knowing that the D'Ascoynes were granted an exclusive privilege to have the title/dukedom passed down through the distaff side as well as the spear side, Louis of course is aware there are but eight D'Ascoynes between him and the dukedom. He resolves to murder them all--and unlike most audiences, I cannot blame him one bit.This black comedy with its tinge of gallows humor (they didn't overdo it and were not 'sick' about how they portrayed it)--truly, it is funny as hell. In particular, the death of young Henry D'Ascoyne in an explosion has to be one of cinema's funniest moments. The D'Ascoynes are all played by Sir Alec Guinness, who glows with the glory of the sun here. He inspired Peter Sellers and pretty much all this type of comedy ever since.The D'Ascoynes (a play on the Norman-blooded aristos who ruled the land back then) consist of cardboard-cutout mockeries: the present Duke, the banker, the vicar, the Royal Army general, the admiral, ""young"" Ascoyne D'Ascoyne, ""young"" Henry and finally old Lady Agatha (all ""ladies"" in cinema ever since have been modeled in some way or another on Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne).Louis is happily spared having to murder two of them (the admiral goes down with his ship, a scene which almost resulted in Guinness drowning, and the banker, who hires Mazzini because he is family, suffers a stroke). Dennis Price does an excellent job of playing a bitterly angry, psychotically smarmy English gentleman who has been humiliated--in one scene by Ascoyne D'Ascoyne--and suffered horrid poverty.This film is all the more stunning for its ending, which I will certainly not spoil because it is a ""double-twist"" in the plot which will leave you anxious at the end. Huzzah for the British sadistic streak! The one truly odious person is Louis' sometime girlfriend Sibella (a revolting Joan Greenwood, a lifelong bit-player)--she is a little hissing snake with a weak, whiny voice and the cold soul of a true psychopath.Of course it is Guinness who steals the show, even while it is annoyingly obsessed with Dennis Price--who was neither particularly gifted as an actor or as a human being. Yet Guinness domineers in every scene he has, and I can only wonder at the dreadful toll this took on him. The famous scene most recall from this film is the shot of all the D'Ascoynes in church--every one of them is Guinness, and it took days to shoot/perfect the camera trick that was used.Naturally there are strange goofs in the film and I have surrendered the endeavor to comprehend them. There is a document dating 1860-something, yet Louis clearly states they are living in the 20th century. This in spite of the clearly Victorian Era clothes, sets and customs--and there is a vague hint that the year is post-1893 but that is all. To be frank, I still do not know exactly when this story is set!You'd be a buffoon to miss seeing this excellent comedy-standard-setter. Personally I never wanted it in my collection as I have, for example,Our Man in Havana(see my review)--because unlike HAVANA, HEARTS can be enough one time round. Of course, you may wish to have it in order to see it, say, once every two or three years ....Final word of caution: there is a slightly sanitized American version of HEARTS that seems to be missing about 10 seconds of action. I do not know who is selling what, so be careful. That plus the idiotic retitling of this great classic is enough to raise some red flags. Be sure to inquire which version you are getting ...

From the young to the old, women and men, wise and foolish, vain and comely. The amazing Alec Guinness pulls this off with panache in ""Kind Hearts and Coronets."" Though his performances radiate brilliance, they by no means remain the sole focal point of this macabre Victorian-era comedy. Dennis Price, as the noble and dignified serial killer Louis Mazzini, deserves as much credit as Guinness for making this movie one of Ealing Studio's most acclaimed. Not to mention the sizzling women, Joan Greenwood and Valerie Hobson, who get caught, and do some plotting themselves, between the character's cross-ambitions.The film opens with Louis Mazzini writing and dialoguing his memoirs from prison. He awaits execution for murder. How did a Duke arrive in such an unseemly state? He begins with his mother, who married for love and was thus ousted from the elite D'Ascoyne family, a Dukedom with royal lineage. After his mother's death (his father had suffered a cornary the moment he set eyes on Louis in swaddling clothes), Louis vows revenge on her family and gradually plays out his murderous desires. One by one all of the roles so masterfully played by Guinness succumb to Louis's plots. In parallel, his childhood love, Sibella, refuses his hand in marriage and announces that she's to marry his old rival, Lionel. This fuels Louis's plots and he at last obtains his denied title. The wife of one of the murdered, Edith D'Ascoyne, accepts Louis's offer of marriage, but soon after he finds himself charged with the murder of Sibella's husband. It becomes clear that Sibella plans to blackmail Louis. Her false testimony, in front of the House of Lords, of course, lands him in jail for one of the few deaths in the film that he did not bring about. The day of the execution Sibella visits Louis and makes him an offer he can't refuse: she will expose her husband's hidden suicide note and prove Louis's innocence. In return he must murder his wife. That little schemer - and what's up with those hats? On the way out of prison Louis sees two carriages, one containing his legal wife, the other containing Sibella, his lover.

362953,A2V6T24IY09M0X,6303209947,Felix Felicis,"[14, 14]","""Kind Hearts and Coronets"", a rather odd title for one of the darkest and most gleefully perverse comedies ever made, in Britain or any other country. The title is a reference to a line by Tennyson, ""Kind hearts are more than coronets, And simple faith than Norman blood."" Well, plenty of Norman blood is shed in this signature Ealing farce. I had not previously seen the film until the day the Criterion release came out, but I had heard a lot of positive about it and figured a blind buy would be worth it.What a purchase! I never expected a film from 1949 to be so amoral and sexually charged. The movie opens in jail, with a hangman making the final preparations for the execution of the 10th Duke of Chalfont, Louis Mazzini (Dennis Price). The remainder of the movie is told in flashback with Mazzini's narration - he tells us, quite detached from the events on screen, exactly how he came to be in such a precarious position.Mazzini's mother, a member of the wealthy D'Ascoyne clan, ran off with an Italian opera singer and was barred from associating with her family again. On her deathbed, as a result of a tragic accident, she made a last request to be buried in the family plot - which was refused. In his anger, Mazzini vows revenge, and decides to murder all the remaining members of the D'Ascoyne clan one by one - which would also make him the next Duke of Chalfont. Throughout all this, there is also another running subplot involving his childhood friend Sibella Holland (Joan Greenwood) and her equally intriguing scheming, and how they play off each other.Did I mention this a comedy? It sounds so serious but it isn't, and since all the actors underplay the increasingly absurd situations, the subtle acting and the purposefully dry and detached but extremely funny narration make this a classic. The delicate language of the script is evident, as it is filled with deliciously biting one-liners (for example: ""It is so difficult to make a neat job of killing people with whom one is not on friendly terms.""); a lot of the humor comes from the class structure at the time (1900 or so), as Mazzini outworldly gives all appearances of being a charming gentleman on his way up in the world when in reality he is a ruthless and efficient serial killer. Dennis Price is pitch-perfect; from the first few minutes he engages our sympathy and we are rooting for him to succeed in his quest, yet he also manages to convey a strong wickedness simultaneously. Without his throughly grounded performance, the film wouldn't work.Speaking of great performances, I have yet to mention the best part: Sir Alec Guiness, by himself, plays the entire D'Ascoyne clan (yes, even the lone female, in one particularly hilarious killing on a hot air balloon for women's suffrage). It's an acting tour de force - with some makeup, a few wigs, and a different posture and accent he is able to conjure up a variety of silly and memorable characters. my particular favorite is Admiral Horatio D'Ascoyne; after making a terrible blunder in terms of the naval direction of his ship, he crashes it straight into another and both sink. All survive except him, we are told in the voiceover, since he stubbornly went down with the ship. The shot of Guiness saluting as he slowly sinks to death had me in tears.In short, ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" is a highly subversive, witty, and devious satire of class manners and murder - certainly the kind of sardonic and cynical British comedy classic that they rarely make anymore. Filled with uniformly excellent performances, a sly script, and many fascinating twists and turns (including the famously open ending), this DVD is highly recommended. The Criterion Collection edition includes a sterling new HD transfer 1.33:1, an informative full-length documentary on Ealing Studios (with a lot of time spent on ""Kind Hearts""), and a great rare 70-minute interview with Alec Guiness, conducted after ""Star Wars"", in which he is relaxed and full of anecdotes (often very amusing).

KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS is renowned for having Alec Guinness take on eight roles, and being bumped off in seven of them.

Nice nod-and-wink touches, to be sure, but al of this would  mean next to nothing if the film itself weren't such a masterful entertainment.Guinness, as it turns out, really is not the focus of the film.  Dennis Price, whose subsequent career seemed to trend more toward the horror genre, is the film's actual lead, and he's spectacular as the elegant young social climber/vengeance seeker, obsessed with doing away with the many estranged relatives who stand between him and dukedom.

It's a dark comedy with a modern tone to it that features a great performance(s) by Alec Guinness. It's often remarked that Guinness is most remembered Obi-Wan Kenobi from the ""Star Wars"" films. This is a shame. I'm no expert on Guinness's acting career, but watching this film (and ""Lawrence of Arabia"") it's clear to me how genius this man was. A true chameleon. Guinness is not the star, however, it's Dennis Price, a charming fellow whom I've never seen in a film before. He plays Louis, a man embittered about the fact that his beloved mother (a member of the D'Ascoyne family) was denied the chance to be buried in the family vault because of the fact that she married beneath her. On top of that, Louis is in love with Sibella (Joan Greenwood), a woman who is looking for a rich man to marry and doesn't have the time for the poor Louis. As Sibella prepares to marry Lionel (John Penrose), a man she doesn't love, Louis decides to strike back at the D'Ascoyne family for what they did to his mother and also for the chance to become Duke and win Sibella over. He begins to plot the murders of the 8 members of the family that stand in his way of becoming Duke and quickly begins with Ascoyne D'Ascoyne (Guinness) by causing him to drown. Moving on to Henry D'Ascoyne, a man he grows to admire, he also meets Edith (Valerie Hobson), Henry's wife.The three hit it off, but Henry's death is inevitable and when he's gone, it leaves a window open for Louis to take advantage of his friendship with Edith. I don't want to reveal much more of the plot, but Guinness also plays Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne, General Lord Rufus D'Ascoyne, Reverend Lord Henry D'Ascoyne, Admiral Lord Horatio D'Ascoyne, Duke Ethelred D'Ascoyne, and Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne. Guinness has no dialogue as Lady Agatha, but still manages to make quite an impression. Watching this man become these 8 characters is absolutely incredible. He was truly a chameleon. There are times where it's hard to even tell it's Guinness and this is before make-up could make you look anyway you wanted to and turn you into anything. ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" isn't just Guinness's show though and Price makes an interesting protagonist and the female leads are beautiful. ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" probably isn't the easiest movie to find, but it's worth seeking out.GRADE: B+",4,Well Done,1179273600,"05 16, 2007",2007,2457,"['being', 'relatively', 'obscure', 'Kind', 'Hearts', 'Coronets', 'considered', 'masterpiece', 'many', 'film', 'critics', 'historians', 'dark', 'comedy', 'modern', 'tone', 'great', 'performance', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'often', 'remarked', 'Guinness', 'most', 'remembered', 'Obi-Wan', 'Kenobi', 'Star', 'Wars', 'films', 'shame', ""'m"", 'expert', 'Guinness', 'acting', 'career', 'watching', 'film', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'clear', 'how', 'genius', 'man', 'was', 'true', 'chameleon', 'Guinness', 'not', 'star', 'however', 'Dennis', 'Price', 'charming', 'fellow', 'whom', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'before', 'Louis', 'man', 'embittered', 'fact', 'beloved', 'mother', 'member', ""D'Ascoyne"", 'family', 'was', 'denied', 'chance', 'be', 'buried', 'family', 'vault', 'fact', 'married', 'top', 'Louis', 'love', 'Sibella', 'Joan', 'Greenwood', 'woman', 'who', 'looking', 'rich', 'man', 'marry', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'poor', 'Louis', 'Sibella', 'marry', 'Lionel', 'John', 'Penrose', 'man', ""n't"", 'love', 'Louis', 'strike', 'back', ""D'Ascoyne"", 'family', 'what', 'did', 'mother', 'also', 'chance', 'become', 'Duke', 'win', 'Sibella', 'plot', 'murders', '8', 'members', 'family', 'stand', 'way', 'becoming', 'Duke', 'quickly', 'Ascoyne', ""D'Ascoyne"", 'Guinness', 'causing', 'drown', 'Moving', 'Henry', ""D'Ascoyne"", 'man', 'admire', 'also', 'Edith', 'Valerie', 'Hobson', 'Henry', 'wife.The', 'three', 'hit', 'off', 'Henry', 'death', 'inevitable', 'when', 'gone', 'window', 'open', 'Louis', 'take', 'advantage', 'friendship', 'Edith', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'reveal', 'much', 'more', 'plot', 'Guinness', 'also', 'Lord', 'Ascoyne', ""D'Ascoyne"", 'General', 'Lord', 'Rufus', ""D'Ascoyne"", 'Reverend', 'Lord', 'Henry', ""D'Ascoyne"", 'Admiral', 'Lord', 'Horatio', ""D'Ascoyne"", 'Duke', 'Ethelred', ""D'Ascoyne"", 'Lady', 'Agatha', ""D'Ascoyne"", 'Guinness', 'dialogue', 'Lady', 'Agatha', 'still', 'make', 'impression', 'Watching', 'man', 'become', '8', 'characters', 'absolutely', 'incredible', 'was', 'truly', 'chameleon', 'are', 'times', 'where', 'hard', 'even', 'tell', 'Guinness', 'make-up', 'could', 'make', 'look', 'anyway', 'wanted', 'turn', 'anything', 'Kind', 'Hearts', 'Coronets', ""n't"", 'just', 'Guinness', 'show', 'Price', 'interesting', 'protagonist', 'female', 'leads', 'are', 'beautiful', 'Kind', 'Hearts', 'Coronets', 'probably', ""n't"", 'easiest', 'movie', 'find', 'worth', 'seeking', 'out.GRADE', 'B+']",N/A

362971,A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK,6303209947,"Kurt Harding ""bon vivant""","[0, 0]","This film was included in a box set I bought that features 50 years of Janus Films. Most of the films I had never heard of since most were made before my time, so I have only the company's reputation for good taste to guide me. I may never have seen Kind Hearts and Coronets if I had not bought the box set since there is nothing in the title ( part of a quote from Tennyson, as it turns out) that would lead me to believe this is a film I might like. As it turns out, its just the kind of darkly hilarious movie I do like.I won't rehash the plot in its entirety, but Dennis Price is marvelous as Louis Mazzini, a man born of an aristocratic mother and a commoner father who bitterly resents being cheated out of what he considered to be his birthright. His father had died at Louis' birth and so he was raised in poverty by his loving mother and made keenly aware by her of both his heritage and his rightful station in life. Her premature death from an accident galvanizes him to plotting the demise of those members of the D'Ascoyne family who stand between him and the dukedom he feels is rightfully his. What happens next becomes progressively funnier.Though needy, Louis is an arrogant twit. As his goal comes ever closer to realization, you'll note that he becomes ever more arrogant. I like the scene where the rival who had married the woman Louis loved ends by calling Louis to his home in order to discreetly beg him to save him from bankruptcy . Louis coldly but justifiably refuses him and showers him with deserved scorn. This leads to a fight and the irony is that Louis's visit to the home of his rival culminates in his later being arrested for and convicted of the one murder he did not commit!There are a lot of other things going on as well, too much to describe without spoiling the film for you. There are several love triangles and any number of nasty jabs at the British aristocracy, some subtle and some not. There is the masterful acting of Alec Guinness who plays all the D'Ascoyne roles, including that of the window-smashing suffragette. Valerie Hobson and Joan Greenwood each put in strong performances as the rival ladies in Mazzini's life. The bloviating executioner is too funny. But it is the ending that is purely delicious. Not only does Mazzini face a Hobson's choice in love, but there is something else which clouds his future.

Bernabo,"[3, 3]","Alec Guiness is justly celebrated for playing eight roles in the classic 1950 Ealing Comedy ""Kind Hearts and Coronets,"" but you do have to remind yourself when you are enjoying this film that there is a reason the actor was not given top billing.  Guiness plays a long line of murder victims, all of whom are dispatched in various ways by Louis Mazzini (Dennis Price), a newly minted Duke who, as the film opens, is going to be hung the next morning at 8 o'clock for murder (Price also plays his father, but no one makes a big deal of this effort).  We find the Duke spending his final night writing his memoirs, which will explain how he came to this unfortunate end, so as not not to deny the public a full appreciation of his fate; for the same reason he has ordered not only coffee and toast for his final breakfast, but grapes, so that the public will not feel disappointed with the news of his meager taste.With Louis as our narrator we go back to the beginning of the story, when his Mama (Audrey Fildes) was disowned by the aristocratic D'Ascoyne family after she ran away with an Italian tenor, who promptly died upon the announcement of the birth of a son.  Attempts to reconcile by Louis's mother with the family were coldly rejected and she raised the boy in relative poverty, but with a sense of class that would serve him well in the future.  It was the dream of his mother that Louis might one day inherit the title, which descends through the women as well as the men; the title was given for service to King Charles II during the Interegnum by the first Duke and the right of the women to inherit was added by services of the Duchess after the Restoration.  When his mother denies and is refused burial in the D'Ascoyne family crypt, Louis vows to make her dream come true by bumping off all of his relations that stand between him and his goal, using his mother's copy of the family tree to help make sure he does it right.Guiness plays eight different D'Ascoyne family members, from an Admiral and a General to a Parson and a dowager suffragette, creating distinct characters even when reduced to only a line or two of dialogue; too bad the opening credits give away the game.  However, ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" really is Dennis Price's movie polite killer and would be Duke.  Price had been born into an upper class family and after this effort two of his next three films would find him playing Lord Byron.  Therefore, it is not surprising that he hits the proper mark with the impeccable sense of propriety and reserved indignation he brings to his quest.  His effort is ultimately complicated by his affections for both his childhood sweetheart, Sibella (Joan Greenwood), who refused to wait for him to become a Duke and married another, and Edith D'Asoyne (Valerie Hobson), the wife of one of his early victims, who would make a most suitable and deserving Duchess.This is a film where we root for the ""hero"" to succeed in his quest although we are well aware that he is a naughty boy who should be punished and have reason to believe Fate is helping Louis along with his efforts because some of the offending D'Asoyne relatives manage to meet their own ends without his assistance.  Besides, there is some creativity involved in most of the murders that has to be appreciated as well; if not totally ingenious, at least he does not cheapen his efforts by using the same trick twice.  The ending of the film presents a series of ironies that seem totally appropriate give the fact that our hero is a serial killer.""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" begain a string of classic roles for Guiness is Ealing comedies, amply seen the following year when he made both ""The Lavender Hill Mob"" and ""The Man in the White Suit.""

It held my interest from beginning to end, which isn't an easy task, and it has a cute surprise ending to tie up all the loose ends.Our protagonist is a serial killer and a snob.  We like him anyway.  That's funny right there.  How often do you get to root for the serial killer?  He is a poor relation, in line for a dukedom, if only a too-large number of rich relations would conveniently die.  He helps them along.He has no heart at all.  He uses his two female co-stars coldly.  He has no redeeming social value.  Yet he is likeable all the same, more or less.One of the funniest scenes, for me, is near the beginning, when we are introduced to the serial killer's father, an Italian opera singer entertaining a small audience.  He's terrible.  It's really funny.  He is presented to us as being handsome and talented, and that in itself is hysterical.I don't know if anyone would agree, but this film reminds me a bit of the Pink Panther movies.  They have a high-class British feel to them, and yet they have the same type of dry humor.  This one isn't played for constant comedy though, and it is more of a human interest drama than a slapstick comedy.I didn't realize that all of the murder victims, all of the high class relatives of our serial killer, were played by Alec Guinness (even the female suffragette in the balloon), until I saw the credits at the end.  That gave me a laugh.  Remarkable family resemblance they all had.The reason I am not giving it five stars is that there is no emotion and not a lot of intensity in the experience.

But Louis was raised to value his blue-blooded heritage, with the understanding that he was in line to inherit the Dukedom of Chalfont and its accompanying wealth, although it was a very long line. Louis eventually becomes frustrated by his professional prospects and so spiteful of the D'Ascoyne's arrogance that he decides to elevate himself to the Dukedom...by murdering the 8 heirs that stand before him in the line of inheritance.&quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; is probably the most acclaimed and widely appreciated of the &quot;Ealing Comedies&quot;, which Great Britain's Ealing Studios produced after World War II under the reign of studio boss Michael Balcon. The film was directed by Robert Hamer and brilliantly adapted for the screen by Hamer and John Dighton. It is loosely based on the 1907 novel &quot;Israel Rank&quot; by Roy Harniman, although the novel is not a comedy, and its tone as well as the personality of its protagonist are very different from the movie. &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; is probably best known for Alec Guinness' multiple comic performances. He plays all 8 members of the D'Ascoyne family, who range in age from 24 to about 80, with comic but convincing flair. Dennis Price, as Louis, recounts the film's events  with wonderfully dry wit. His one-liners are priceless. Sociopathic behavior has never been more delightful. The filmmakers shamelessly lampoon the  hereditary aristocracy, all in the form of Alec Guinness. &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; is simply a thoroughly enjoyable film.The DVD: Bonus features include a rather long theatrical trailer and a written bio for Sir Alec Guinness, also long.

In fact, this is a first rate comedy in many ways.  This was one in a series of great comedies produced by the Ealing Studios in the 1940s and 1950s.The film stars Dennis Price as the narrator, Louis Mazzini.  He recounts his efforts to wreck revenge on the members of his mother's titled family who had disowned her when she married an Italian opera singer.  His particular form of revenge consists of murder, and the film consists of his various efforts in this direction.  Guinness, who in the course of his career managed to die in an astounding number of films, in this one manages to die eight times.  He is excellent in each and every incarnation of a member of the D'Ascoyne family.  Valerie Hobson is as elegant as always in playing the widow of one his victims with whom he later becomes romantically involved.  Hobson was a great light of British cinema in the forties and early fifties, but gave up acting to marry politician John Profumo, who would be the principal public figure to fall in the Christine Keeler scandal.  The film also features one of my all time favorite actresses, Joan Greenwood, who may have possessed the most delicious voice of any female in the history of film.  Mention must also be made of Miles Malleson, who has a small but memorable role as the hangman.The makers of the film manage a perfect concoction of highbrow wit that still managed to border on the absurd.  For instance, at one point Mr. Mazzini informs a victim that he will first kill him and then run screaming for help, and then we manage to see him doing precisely that, running from the woods crying for assistance.  There are many marvelous lines, many of them almost throwaways.  As a fan of Samuel Johnson, I was delighted when Mazzini tells someone, ""Dr. Johnson was right, as he always was . . . ""  In particular, I love the understated humor throughout the film.  If this were a TV show instead of a film, I am certain that they would have dispensed of the laugh track.Before someone complains about the DVD not offering a widescreen option, I should point out that the original was a 35MM print in 1.37:1 ratio.

362990,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,6303209947,Stephanie De Pue,"[4, 11]","""Kind Hearts and Coronets,""(1950), a black comedy/drama, is one of the most famous, and acclaimed, post World War II releases by the British Ealing Studios. SeeEaling Studios Comedy Collection (The Maggie / A Run for Your Money / Titfield Thunderbolt / Whisky Galore! / Passport to Pimlico). It's generally agreed to be a minimalist masterpiece of wit and irony, made in black and white.  Roy Horniman wrote the novel on which it's based, Robert Hamer wrote the screenplay and directed.  Two celebrated witty novelists, Nancy Mitford and Evelyn Waugh, were hired to work on the script, though nothing specific seems to survive of their efforts. The title of the film is quoted from a poem by Alfred, Lord Tennyson.  The picture is a costume drama, set at the turn of the 20th century, though it's generally held to reflect the mood of post-war disillusionment common at the time it was made.  And some viewers may be startled by the film's use, three times in a few minutes, of the racist n----r word: it was in common use in the U.K. at the time, in the child's nursery rhyme ""Eeeny, meeny, miny, mo.""Dennis Price, a leading man of the British cinema in the 1940's, (A Canterbury Tale - Criterion Collection) stars as Louis D'Ascoyne Mazzini.  His Mumsie was a D'Ascoyne, one of a leading, influential, titled and wealthy family that disowned/disinherited her when she eloped with an Italian tenor, leaving her to a life of miserable poverty after the singer's untimely death.  And to crown insult with injury, they won't even allow poor Mumsie to be buried in the family crypt after her death.  So Louis vows revenge - something he's happy to point out that the Italians have always preferred served cold.  He decides to murder all the eight D'Ascoynes that stand between him and the family dukedom and estates.  He doesn't actually know any of them, of course, not as a poor man working as a sales assistant in a shop, but where there's a will, there's a way.  And this is surely the lightest treatment of a serial killer that the world ever has seen, with a cleverly ironic ending.The movie's probably best known now for the fact that all eight of Louis's victims are played by the talented young Alec Guinness, (most honored recently, as the Jedi Obi Wan Kenobi in 1977'sStar Wars Trilogy; he also won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for 1957'sThe Bridge on the River Kwai.) Guinness was hired to play four of the victims, and volunteered to play them all, in a feat that's never been matched and probably never will be.  The vics are of different ages and sexes, talk and walk differently, have different mannerisms, etc.  Unfortunately, his two funniest performances are also two of the briefest, the General, and Lady Agatha, suffragist - he's got the galumphing British actress Margaret Rutherford (seeThe Agatha Christie Miss Marple Movie Collection (Murder at the Gallop / Murder Ahoy / Murder Most Foul / Murder She Said)) down pat, if only he were a little heavier.  Guinness said at one point that he lived in terror he would confuse his characters: that he would open his mouth as the ""Suffragette,"" as he persisted in calling this character -- and the General's voice would come out.The young Joan Greenwood, (The Man in the White Suit), famous for her plummy, husky, sexy voice, and chosen by ""Empire Magazine"" as #63 of the 100 Sexiest Movie Stars in 1995, plays Louis' life-long chum, and then mistress, the fickle, selfish, manipulative Sibilla.  That tall, quintessentially beautiful and elegant English rose (though she was born in Northern Ireland), Valerie Hobson, (Unpublished Story (British Cinema Collection)), plays prim Mrs. Henry D'Ascoyne, whom Louis first widows, and then marries.  And, says, Louis, how well he could love the one, if only the other were not there.Miles Malleson briefly shines as a snobbish hangman, wondering how to address a duke, before hanging him.  The Welsh-born Hugh Griffith, (The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain), who joined the British Army and served in India and Burma during the War, plays Lord High Steward.  Hobson, daughter of a British Army officer, was married to John Profumo, a Member of the British Cabinet, when a sex scandal broke around him in 1963 and rocked the country.  She retreated to private life, where she did outstanding charity work for leprosy sufferers.Dennis Price, star of the film, was a tall, suave, elegant, popular leading man of the time.  He was born to privilege, as the son of a brigadier general, whose family expected him to go into the army or the church, as they had for generations.  But he became an actor, generally playing upper-crust characters.  His initial entry into the theater was mentored by John Gielgud and Noel Coward.  Hello; you have to say, didn't that ring any bells, as both performers were members in good standing of Britain's elite gay mafia?  And his vibe in the movie is hardly that of a lusty man?  Be that as it may, very soon after making ""Kind Hearts,"" by the 1950's, Price was a serious alcoholic, no longer capable of carrying a movie. (He did contribute a good cameo to 1959'sI'm All Right Jack.) Sadly, it seems likely his double life undid him.  Truth is so much tougher to handle than fiction.",3,Lightest Treatment of a Serial Killer Ever Made,1217721600,"08 3, 2008",2008,5248,"['Kind', 'Hearts', 'Coronets', '1950', 'black', 'comedy/drama',

""Pop Culture Addict""","[6, 7]","Robert Hamer's ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" is a delightful black comedy full of chuckles and pointed commentary on the British class structure.  Never has the demise of a family been so elegantly amusing.Louis Mazzini (Dennis Price) starts to write his memoirs on the night before his execution.  He recounts his diabolical plan do away with various members of the D'Ascoyne family (all played by Alec Guinness) so that he may secure a noble title for himself.  Mazzini's tale is one of ruthless - and hilarious - efficiency that ultimately ends badly due to the meddling of the vindictive Sibella Holland (Joan Greenwood).Much of the attention that ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" has attracted over the years has been due to Alec Guinness' multiple roles.  While he is outstanding as the assorted victims, credit must also be given to the wonderful Price who shines as the charming serial-killer.  Mazzini emerges as such a charismatic and witty character that you will find yourself cheering him on as he moves from one clueless target to the next.  Greenwood is equally splendid as the woman who throws a wrench into the assassin's plans.  While ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" is filled with great moments, special mention must be made of the sequence where Mazzini targets Lady Agatha.

It's worth seeing it just for her.That's really all you need to know, but the rest of the movie is pretty good too (ironic understatement alert!).

Absolutely anything.  Even so, he's NOT the best character actor in the cast: Miles Malleson as the poetically-inclined hangman steals the trophy.In order to pass the British censors, the story had to end with the killer getting caught, even though he's the protagonist.
