802934,A358XP3X4U0X45,B0001F33GW,bookloversfriend,"[19, 50]","This movie should have had five stars.  There's a lot here to like.  It has a good supporting cast and some really moving moments throughout the film.  So, what's wrong?  Why is this movie out of print so soon when it could have been a Christmas perennial?Primarily, the casting of the leading lady.  Yes, it does have a strong romance story, and in order for a love story to work, the audience has to fall in love with the man and the woman.  But they cast a woman who was not just ""overweight""; this woman was fat.  Sorry, I know it's politically incorrect to say that, but it's true nonetheless.  Unless you're a fan of hers, the love story just won't work for you.  Movie stars routinely lose weight for a film.  Why didn't she?Second, the script is a bit disjointed (although it has some very strong moments and good scenes).  The conflict should have been about coming home versus staying in the big city, advancing in your career versus accepting chickens as payment for services rendered, etc.  Instead, we have an insecurity story, and even this story had problems: first, we can't relate to it because we're not told until the end what caused the insecurity.  We needed to be told early and not just told but shown the scene.  Second, the story is not developed.  It's just there.  Third, its resolution is not developed; instead, a crisis comes along and poof! the phobia is gone.Note that the ""Product Description"" above is a total joke.  None of it is accurate!  Who writes these things?On the positive side again, the performance by Jack Palance is amazing.  He plays a good guy this time, and plays it very well and convincingly.  Only trouble is that he is the only one in the whole set who has stage presence.  Whenever he is in a scene, the eye inexorably travels to him, even though he isn't moving, isn't doing anything to attract attention.Bottom line: see this movie anyway.  There aren't many that can touch it.  If you like family movies and relationship movies told with heart and compassion, see also Mary Christmas, An Angel in the Family, The Christmas Shoes, Unlikely Angel, or read the novel A Thanksgiving Miracle.  These are the best of the best.  There are a lot of fake holiday movies and books out there.  These are the genuine article.",4,heartbreaker,1125964800,"09 6, 2005",2005,2271,"['movie', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'five', 'stars', 'lot', 'here', 'like', 'good', 'supporting', 'cast', 'really', 'moving', 'moments', 'film', 'So', 'what', 'wrong', 'Why', 'movie', 'print', 'so', 'soon', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Christmas', 'perennial', 'Primarily', 'casting', 'leading', 'lady', 'Yes', 'have', 'strong', 'romance', 'story', 'order', 'love', 'story', 'work', 'audience', 'fall', 'love', 'man', 'woman', 'cast', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'overweight', 'woman', 'was', 'fat', 'Sorry', 'know', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'say', 'true', 'nonetheless', ""'re"", 'fan', 'hers', 'love', 'story', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'work', 'Movie', 'routinely', 'lose', 'weight', 'film', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Second', 'script', 'bit', 'disjointed', 'very', 'strong', 'moments', 'good', 'scenes', 'conflict', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'coming', 'home', 'versus', 'staying', 'big', 'city', 'advancing', 'career', 'accepting', 'chickens', 'payment', 'services', 'rendered', 'etc', 'Instead', 'have', 'insecurity', 'story', 'even', 'story', 'had', 'problems', 'first', 'ca', ""n't"", 'relate', ""'re"", 'not', 'told', 'end', 'what', 'caused', 'insecurity', 'needed', 'be', 'told', 'early', 'not', 'just', 'told', 'shown', 'scene', 'Second', 'story', 'not', 'developed', 'just', 'there', 'Third', 'resolution', 'not', 'developed', 'instead', 'crisis', 'along', 'poof', 'phobia', 'gone.Note', 'Product', 'Description', 'above', 'total', 'joke', 'None', 'accurate', 'Who', 'things', 'positive', 'side', 'again', 'performance', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'amazing', 'good', 'guy', 'time', 'very', 'well', 'convincingly', 'Only', 'trouble', 'only', 'one', 'whole', 'set', 'who', 'stage', 'presence', 'scene', 'eye', 'inexorably', 'travels', 'even', ""n't"", 'moving', ""n't"", 'doing', 'anything', 'attract', 'attention.Bottom', 'line', 'see', 'movie', 'anyway', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'can', 'touch', 'like', 'family', 'movies', 'relationship', 'movies', 'told', 'heart', 'compassion', 'see', 'also', 'Mary', 'Christmas', 'Angel', 'Family', 'Christmas', 'Shoes', 'Unlikely', 'Angel', 'read', 'novel', 'A', 'Thanksgiving', 'Miracle', 'are', 'best', 'best', 'are', 'lot', 'fake', 'holiday', 'movies', 'books', 'out', 'there', 'are', 'genuine', 'article']",I'll Be Home for Christmas

Wanting to get through the movies we taped around Christmas more than we had time to watch, we didn't set our expectation too high -- just wanted to clear it from our schedule.  However we were very pleasantly surprised.  Of course it had 3 of our favorite actors, i.e., Ann Jillian, Robert Hays, and Jack Palance so we figured it should not really be a bad movie.  It was a very good movie with good acting by the three and also Ashley Gorrel and many of the townspeople.  It was well paced but in a couple of places I had to rewind to get what was said.

802939,A2GZVA22WYG95I,B0001F33GW,J. Olsen,"[3, 3]","This isn't a deep or extremely dynamic movie, but it is good and I thought it was fairly well done. You can nitpick over little things, but overall it was worth watching and I enjoy being able to see it whenever I choose. The acting of the lead characters is excellent, including the young girl.St. Nicholas, Iowa is a small town in need of a doctor or the hospital will have to be shut down. Beautiful Ann Jillian plays the mayor and town vet who is also trying to stitch up an occasional human patient. Robert Hayes plays the town's favorite son who went away and became a doctor. Everyone thought he would return, but instead he married and settled into a job in a large hospital in the city. His wife died a few years ago and now he and his daughter are going home for Christmas for the first time, while he tries to overcome the demons that are shaking his confidence in his own ability as a doctor. Jack Palance is amazing as his father who does what he can to encourage him to reunite with his old high school flame (Ann Jillian). Rather than explain to anyone that he is struggling, he makes up a story about getting a promotion and having to hurry back to work and he runs back to the city, but not to a promotion. Unable to overcome his insecurities in the operating room, he turns in his scalpel for a desk job in administration. Things come to a head when his dad, who came to the city with them for Christmas, needs emergency surgery and his daughter pleads with him to help grampa.Will the eccentric townspeople of St. Nicholas have to close their hospital? Who will have the honor of being the ""grand electrician"" who lights the town's Christmas tree on Christmas Eve? And why is Janet, the pig, off her feed? Just a good, old-fashioned small-town Christmas the whole family can enjoy.",4,A Hometown Christmas,1256601600,"10 27, 2009",2009,1800,"[""n't"", 'deep', 'extremely', 'dynamic', 'movie', 'good', 'thought', 'was', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'can', 'nitpick', 'over', 'little', 'things', 'overall', 'was', 'worth', 'watching', 'enjoy', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'whenever', 'choose', 'acting', 'lead', 'characters', 'excellent', 'including', 'young', 'girl.St', 'Nicholas', 'Iowa', 'small', 'town', 'need', 'doctor', 'hospital', 'will', 'have', 'be', 'shut', 'down', 'Beautiful', 'Ann', 'Jillian', 'mayor', 'town', 'vet', 'who', 'also', 'trying', 'stitch', 'up', 'occasional', 'human', 'patient', 'Robert', 'Hayes', 'town', 'favorite', 'son', 'who', 'went', 'away', 'became', 'doctor', 'Everyone', 'thought', 'would', 'return', 'instead', 'married', 'settled', 'job', 'large', 'hospital', 'city', 'wife', 'died', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'now', 'daughter', 'are', 'going', 'home', 'Christmas', 'first', 'time', 'overcome', 'demons', 'are', 'shaking', 'confidence', 'own', 'ability', 'doctor', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'amazing', 'father', 'who', 'what', 'can', 'encourage', 'reunite', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'flame', 'Ann', 'Jillian', 'Rather', 'explain', 'anyone', 'struggling', 'up', 'story', 'getting', 'promotion', 'having', 'hurry', 'back', 'work', 'back', 'city', 'not', 'promotion', 'Unable', 'overcome', 'insecurities', 'operating', 'room', 'scalpel', 'desk', 'job', 'administration', 'Things', 'come', 'head', 'when', 'dad', 'who', 'came', 'city', 'Christmas', 'emergency', 'surgery', 'daughter', 'pleads', 'help', 'grampa.Will', 'eccentric', 'townspeople', 'St.', 'Nicholas', 'have', 'close', 'hospital', 'Who', 'will', 'have', 'honor', 'being', 'grand', 'electrician', 'who', 'lights', 'town', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'why', 'Janet', 'pig', 'feed', 'Just', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'small-town', 'Christmas', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy']",I'll Be Home for Christmas
