Shows combining everyday life and something supernatural, which I think is an awesome and hugely entertaining combination. For those who don't know what this is all about, it follows a man living in Chicago, who receives tomorrows paper every morning. Then you can probably imagine the rest, and how entertaining it is.

1116540,A1LH7YTNTWP6MT,B000YA82GA,Andrew Furst,"[4, 4]","What a great show and great DVD set, at a very reasonable price (currently $29.99 at Amazon).  Nearly 12 years since it first aired, I am very glad to finally have this DVD set, first time it's ever been available in any format. Six DVDs, very well packaged in a plastic box.  Each DVD is securely in place and easily accessible, yet the entire box is only the width of a normal DVD.  The only downside to the packaging is that the episode guide is covered up by DVD #1 and DVD #6, so you have to remove those to read the guide, or else open the package wide and pull out the insert to read the guide.  But who wants to read the guide anyway, when the enjoyment here is from playing all the DVDs from beginning to end?  I'd rather be surprised than read the DVD guide ahead of time.  A guide like this is only valuable for identifying favorite episodes to re-watch anyway, as far as I'm concerned.  I say just watch the episodes from the beginning, without looking at the episode guide ahead of time.As far as the picture and sound quality here goes, it's great.  I was a little surprised that the 6 DVDs are one sided rather than double sided. Although double sided DVDs can have quality problems, so maybe it's best that these are one sided.  There are 23 episodes here, each of about 45 minutes (that's the ""hour"" without commercials), so most of these have a little over 3 hours of content (there are also ""trailers"" for each episode, but I did not watch those).  I thought that putting 3 hours of content on one DVD would result in over-compression, but the picture and sound still are really good.  On my PC if I looked extremely closely I could see an ultra-tiny bit of graininess (most movies I've seen on DVD have this too), but that's extremely minor.  I'm especially happy about the quality given the age of the show, 12 years to put this to DVD. The sound is really good and clear too, which as you recall is important - the famous title music is well preserved here.As to the show itself, that's been well discussed by others.  I'll just add that this is one of those programs where character development does matter, so it's great to be able to have this from the beginning.  There are a lot of recurring characters throughout the four years of Early Edition.  And don't get too hung up on little things like the date of the newspaper in the pilot vs. the other episodes.  The date of the paper in the pilot episode shows November, while the later episodes refer to Gary getting the paper starting in September.  Apparently the origin of the paper was changed to September to coincide with the first airings of those episodes (i.e. also in September).  So when the pilot episode says ""November"" on the paper, just think ""September"", and it works.  Especially given that the first episode refers to the Chicago Cubs, which would not have been playing in November anyway. Hey it's a tv show, a unique and terrific one.  And I'm very happy with the way these DVDs turned out.  Now if we can get the other three seasons, I'll be even happier.  But even if season 1 is all we get, it's highly enjoyable, so I definitely recommend it.",5,"It's finally here, and it's great!",1214697600,"06 29, 2008",2008,3142,"['What', 'great', 'show', 'great', 'DVD', 'set', 'very', 'reasonable', 'price', 'currently', '29.99', 'Amazon', 'Nearly', '12', 'years', 'first', 'aired', 'am', 'very', 'glad', 'finally', 'have', 'DVD', 'set', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'been', 'available', 'format', 'Six', 'DVDs', 'very', 'well', 'packaged', 'plastic', 'box', 'DVD', 'securely', 'place', 'easily', 'accessible', 'yet', 'entire', 'box', 'only', 'width', 'normal', 'DVD', 'only', 'downside', 'packaging', 'episode', 'guide', 'covered', 'up', 'DVD', '1', 'DVD', '6', 'so', 'have', 'remove', 'read', 'guide', 'else', 'open', 'package', 'wide', 'pull', 'out', 'insert', 'read', 'guide', 'who', 'read', 'guide', 'anyway', 'when', 'enjoyment', 'here', 'playing', 'DVDs', 'beginning', 'end', ""'d"", 'rather', 'be', 'surprised', 'read', 'DVD', 'guide', 'ahead', 'time', 'guide', 'only', 'valuable', 'identifying', 'favorite', 'episodes', 're-watch', 'anyway', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'say', 'just', 'watch', 'episodes', 'beginning', 'looking', 'episode', 'guide', 'ahead', 'time.As', 'far', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'here', 'great', 'was', 'little', 'surprised', '6', 'DVDs', 'are', 'one', 'sided', 'rather', 'double', 'sided', 'double', 'sided', 'DVDs', 'can', 'have', 'quality', 'problems', 'so', 'maybe', 'best', 'are', 'one', 'sided', 'are', '23', 'episodes', 'here', 'about', '45', 'minutes', 'hour', 'commercials', 'so', 'most', 'have', 'little', '3', 'hours', 'content', 'are', 'also', 'trailers', 'episode', 'did', 'not', 'watch', 'thought', 'putting', '3', 'hours', 'content', 'one', 'DVD', 'would', 'result', 'over-compression', 'picture', 'sound', 'still', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'PC', 'looked', 'extremely', 'closely', 'could', 'see', 'ultra-tiny', 'bit', 'graininess', 'most', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'DVD', 'have', 'too', 'extremely', 'minor', ""'m"", 'especially', 'happy', 'quality', 'given', 'age', 'show', '12', 'years', 'put', 'DVD', 'sound', 'really', 'good', 'clear', 'too', 'recall', 'important', 'famous', 'title', 'music', 'well', 'preserved', 'here.As', 'show', 'been', 'well', 'discussed', 'others', ""'ll"", 'just', 'add', 'one', 'programs', 'where', 'character', 'development', 'matter', 'great', 'be', 'able', 'have', 'beginning', 'are', 'lot', 'recurring', 'characters', 'four', 'years', 'Early', 'Edition', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'hung', 'up', 'little', 'things', 'date', 'newspaper', 'pilot', 'other', 'episodes', 'date', 'paper', 'pilot', 'episode', 'November', 'later', 'episodes', 'refer', 'Gary', 'getting', 'paper', 'starting', 'September', 'Apparently', 'origin', 'paper', 'was', 'changed', 'September', 'coincide', 'first', 'airings', 'episodes', 'i.e', 'also', 'September', 'So', 'when', 'pilot', 'episode', 'November', 'paper', 'just', 'think', 'September', 'Especially', 'given', 'first', 'episode', 'refers', 'Chicago', 'Cubs', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'playing', 'November', 'anyway', 'Hey', 'tv', 'show', 'unique', 'terrific', 'one', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'way', 'DVDs', 'turned', 'out', 'Now', 'can', 'get', 'other', 'three', 'seasons', ""'ll"", 'be', 'even', 'happier', 'even', 'season', '1', 'get', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'definitely', 'recommend']",Early Edition: Season 1
1116541,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B000YA82GA,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[0, 18]","Early Edition is a show about a guy who get tomorrows newspaper, today. As a result he run all over Chicago with his two side kicks, a greedy, unsympathetic stock broker and a wise blind lady and prevents crime and accidents from happening all the while trying to deal with his own complicated life. The show try to be drama but do not really succeed, it tries to be mystery, but do not make it there either. if I was to put it in any category it would be the same as Touched By An Angel and Highway to Heaven but without these show's religious element or magic, but with the same feel good stories. The main character Gary find someone to help and all turn out well in the end.Now this show have a good premise. A mean who predict the future, but in a bit unusual way, with tomorrows newspaper instead of more common ESP and decides to do something about it and use his gift to help pepole. There are however some huge problems with this show. First of all it is extremely repetitive. Gary saves pepole, Chuck, the stock broker tries to make a quick buck and Marissa the blind lady give sagely advice. It is always the same, again and again and again. Problem, sob story, happy ending. Now another problem is the characters, they are so paper thin. Gary is perfect, he never falls for the temptation to use the newspaper for personal gain, he never sneak in lines, he do not raise his voice, he do not walk on bloody red light. Seriously, nobody is that bloody goody, goody perfect. Then we have Chuck, he is egoistic, only want money and is far more realistic than Gary, but why the hell do these two hang out? And then we have Marissa, she is blind, and wise and give good advice, she is like a poser child for I have a disability but that is okey. The wise blind person, have we not seen this before, far to many times. There are some more regular cast being added in laster seasons. I have only seen season 1, perhaps the show will get better then, but I doubt it. The far best character of the show is the cat. The hundred years old, supernatural pussy who bring Gary the paper, it have personality, the other characters do not. It makes me want to see an entire show with mystery pus and just do away with all the other useless characters.There is a continuing story in the show, what is the newspaper, who is the cat and so on, but it moves so slowly it is difficult to stay interested in it. When I sit watching this show I think damned, this could have been so good, but it is so boring, where the hell did they go wrong, they have such a great concept! In all fairness Early Edition is not all bad it do provide some scenes that are amusing, and it is fun to watch, now and again. But if you are buying this series as a DVD box set for a marathon, you will get disappointed.The actors to seam bored when they play this series. I do not know how much more I can say about it. The series have a wonderful premise, but have been executed with not even a hint of creativity, is is a paper thing, drama wannabe supernatural show with to much aspirations and to little guts. Watching an episode now and again is fine, but any more and I want to punch Gary in the nose. I give this show 4 out of 10. Not horrible, but still far from good. Though as I said I have just watched the first season, perhaps I will update this review when I have seen the rest of the series. But I am not hopeful that I will be more amused by that.",2,Good premise but horribly done.,1270512000,"04 6, 2010",2010,3429,"['Early', 'Edition', 'show', 'guy', 'who', 'get', 'tomorrows', 'newspaper', 'today', 'result', 'run', 'Chicago', 'two', 'side', 'kicks', 'greedy', 'unsympathetic', 'stock', 'broker', 'wise', 'blind', 'lady', 'prevents', 'crime', 'accidents', 'happening', 'while', 'trying', 'deal', 'own', 'complicated', 'life', 'show', 'try', 'be', 'drama', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'succeed', 'be', 'mystery', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'either', 'was', 'put', 'category', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'Touched', 'Angel', 'Highway', 'Heaven', 'show', 'religious', 'element', 'magic', 'same', 'feel', 'good', 'stories', 'main', 'character', 'Gary', 'find', 'someone', 'help', 'turn', 'out', 'well', 'end.Now', 'show', 'have', 'good', 'premise', 'mean', 'who', 'predict', 'future', 'bit', 'unusual', 'way', 'tomorrows', 'newspaper', 'instead', 'more', 'common', 'ESP', 'decides', 'do', 'something', 'use', 'gift', 'help', 'pepole', 'are', 'however', 'huge', 'problems', 'show', 'First', 'extremely', 'repetitive', 'Gary', 'pepole', 'Chuck', 'stock', 'broker', 'make', 'quick', 'buck', 'Marissa', 'blind', 'lady', 'give', 'sagely', 'advice', 'always', 'same', 'again', 'again', 'again', 'Problem', 'sob', 'story', 'happy', 'ending', 'Now', 'problem', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'paper', 'thin', 'Gary', 'perfect', 'never', 'temptation', 'use', 'newspaper', 'personal', 'gain', 'never', 'sneak', 'lines', 'do', 'not', 'raise', 'voice', 'do', 'not', 'walk', 'bloody', 'red', 'light', 'Seriously', 'nobody', 'bloody', 'goody', 'goody', 'perfect', 'Then', 'have', 'Chuck', 'egoistic', 'only', 'want', 'money', 'far', 'more', 'realistic', 'Gary', 'why', 'hell', 'do', 'two', 'hang', 'then', 'have', 'Marissa', 'blind', 'wise', 'give', 'good', 'advice', 'poser', 'child', 'have', 'disability', 'okey', 'wise', 'person', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'far', 'many', 'times', 'are', 'more', 'regular', 'cast', 'being', 'added', 'laster', 'seasons', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'season', '1', 'perhaps', 'show', 'will', 'get', 'better', 'then', 'doubt', 'far', 'best', 'character', 'show', 'cat', 'hundred', 'years', 'old', 'supernatural', 'pussy', 'who', 'bring', 'Gary', 'paper', 'have', 'personality', 'other', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'entire', 'show', 'mystery', 'pus', 'just', 'do', 'away', 'other', 'useless', 'continuing', 'story', 'show', 'what', 'newspaper', 'who', 'cat', 'so', 'so', 'slowly', 'difficult', 'stay', 'interested', 'When', 'sit', 'watching', 'show', 'think', 'damned', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'good', 'so', 'boring', 'where', 'hell', 'did', 'go', 'wrong', 'have', 'great', 'concept', 'fairness', 'Early', 'Edition', 'not', 'bad', 'do', 'provide', 'scenes', 'are', 'amusing', 'fun', 'watch', 'now', 'again', 'are', 'buying', 'series', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'marathon', 'will', 'get', 'disappointed.The', 'actors', 'seam', 'bored', 'when', 'play', 'series', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'series', 'have', 'wonderful', 'premise', 'have', 'been', 'executed', 'not', 'even', 'hint', 'creativity', 'paper', 'thing', 'drama', 'wannabe', 'supernatural', 'show', 'much', 'aspirations', 'little', 'guts', 'Watching', 'episode', 'now', 'again', 'fine', 'more', 'want', 'punch', 'Gary', 'nose', 'give', 'show', '4', '10', 'Not', 'horrible', 'still', 'far', 'good', 'said', 'have', 'just', 'watched', 'first', 'season', 'perhaps', 'will', 'update', 'review', 'when', 'have', 'seen', 'rest', 'series', 'am', 'not', 'hopeful', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'amused']",Early Edition: Season 1

Having watched the Pilot last night, I was definitely interested in where the series would go. While the pilot was good, the second episode ""The Choice"" was amazing -- very well written, moving, and for the life of me I couldn't see where it was headed.

1116543,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B000YA82GA,Bobby Underwood,"[59, 61]","Early Edition was one of the most interesting and entertaining hours on television during its run and it's nice to see this fabulous show finally get released. The characters were likable, and all too human at times, making them even more likable. Kyle Chandler proved the perfect choice as a regular guy with foibles who at first tries to cash in like any of us would on his good fortune, then realizes the great responsibility which has been laid at his door, quite literally.Gary Hobson (Kyle Chandler) has been kicked out by his wife and forced to find a hotel. A yellow cat accompanies a newspaper which Gary  eventually discovers is quite special. It is tomorrow's news today, and day after day it is delivered to Gary's door. He reacts as most of us would at first but his good nature finally takes over and he realizes there is a reason he's been chosen to receive the paper.What followed each week was fabulous. One week it was humorous and the next heartbreaking. Shanesia Williams was terrific as his blind pal Marissa, who tried to keep him grounded and lead him towards the right path when the direction seemed unclear. Fisher Stevens was perfectly cast as his pal Chuck, who wanted to take advantage of Gary's windfall but often ended up helping him instead because deep down he was a good guy. It was sort of like Rockford and Angel, just less pronounced. At least in season one.What helped to make the show special was the Chicago atmosphere and some tightly written shows about delicate choices made from the heart, some of which had grave consequences. If you can't do both, do you stop a plane from crashing and taking untold lives, or attempt to save one young girl? If you fall in love with someone you've saved, and feel that joy of finally finding someone, what do you do if you discover she's destined to reunite with someone from her past? And what do you do when people begin to think it's odd you should show up at so many disasters and such at just the right moment to save someone?The show's characters and their interactions had a very real feel and each show had its share of fine moments. Often mixed with humor, but sometimes quite poignant in the end, each week was special. One touching episode had Gary debating over whether not to save one life, because it would give a heart for a transplant which would save a young girl. There was always a balance, however, and the show could be touching but never became maudlin. And it could often find quirky humor within some of the dilemmas.Season one episodes include:  Pilot --  The Choice -- Baby -- The Paper -- Thief Swipes Mayor's Dog -- Hoop Dreams -- After Midnight -- Gun --  His Girl Thursday --The Wrong Man -- Christmas -- Frostbit -- Mob Wife -- The Wall, Part I, -- The Wall, Part II -- Bat Masterson -- The Jury -- Psychic -- The Cat -- Phantom at the Opera -- Faith -- Dad -- Love is BlindAmid all the questionable releases of television shows undeserving, Early Edition truly stands out as something of quality.

The guy that brought you the Wonder Years another classic series. i really dug this series because gary was an average guy doing service for society daily, usually sometimes taken for nut or weird guy, but he got the job done and he was nice plus he had class. i was wishing that it would've gone for a few more seasons when it was airing on TV, but oh well. i do hope that all the music used in the series like  both the themes and etc, music rights can be resolved so the music , theme or otherwise can be used, so us fans will not feel jipped/cheated in anyway, when we buy the DVD of this excellent series, only to find out that the music been changed from what we remember from watching on tv for the first time. SO Please don't change the music or edit the series in anyway leave as is CBS.Personally i wish there were more quality shows on TV like Early Edition it was kinda of depressing when it went off the air and appeared on the PAX/I channel only to disappear again. Good Grief.Highly Recommended Series For Families.Update: This First Season Of Early Edition is wonderfully excellent. I love the packaging of set the way it was done on 6 discs with 4 episodes on each of them and the sound is great. Yes folks it's like you remember music and all, this one is a must get and to have in your TV DVD collection.A NOTE TO CBS EXECS: Please don't jip or screw over the Early Edition fans when you released Season Two or any of the other Seasons coming up, like you did with the poor Fugitive Fans on Season Two Vol.1 and remove anything critical stuff like music/scenes. As I stated before Leave as is CBS, if it takes alittle longer to release the second or any other seasons, we the fans we'll understand and will wait, we don't want a shoddy product with music or scenes removed or missing.

1116546,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B000YA82GA,Chrijeff,"[1, 1]","This delightfully original fantasy-drama centers on Gary Hobson (Kyle Chandler), a young stockbroker at Chicago's Strauss & Associates, whose wife throws him out on their fourth anniversary.  The next morning the doorstep of his hotel room is graced by an orange cat with a piercing yowl, a motorboat purr, and a copy of the Sun-Times.  But this is no ordinary Sun-Times: it's tomorrow's.  It takes Gary a little while to figure out what he has here, but when he does he realizes that ""this is a powerful tool, not something to mess around with.""  Why it comes to him or how, he doesn't know, but he knows what he has to do.  As Sam Beckett ofQuantum Leap: The Complete First Season""puts right what once went wrong,"" so Gary embarks upon a career of putting things right *before* they can go wrong--exposing political corruption and preventing crimes, accidents, traffic jams, family breakups, and other assorted human tragedies, sometimes at the risk of his own life, and mostly on a local scale (though at least once he stops a space-shuttle explosion, once a nuclear meltdown in Russia, and once, in the complex and chilling two-parter ""The Wall,"" he finds himself involved in a planned Presidential assassination), even though his warnings often have people suspecting him of being a meddler, a masher, a crank, or, at best, ""some kind of psychic.""  He's supported (and occasionally hindered) by his best friend Chuck Fishman (Fisher Stevens), a fellow stockbroker and former college roommate, who constantly importunes him for tips on the market, pro sports, or the next lottery winner, by Marissa Clark (Shanesia Davis), a blind receptionist of boundless faith, and by tough 30-year-veteran Detective Lt. Zeke Crumb (Ron Dean) of the Chicago PD, who isn't sure what to make of him but by the end of the season is advising people that they can ""trust"" him.  Chandler's Hobson is somewhat reminiscent of many of James Stewart's parts; he has that same aw-shucks innocence updated with a '90's anger that he was picked for this job without even knowing he was under consideration for it--often he complains bitterly about how ""the Paper"" won't let him have a life, and at least once he tries to reject it, but Cat keeps bringing it all the same.  As the series proceeds we learn more and more about it--how it works, who got it last, what Cat's powers are (and he definitely has some strange ones)--and even Chuck, whom some viewers may find annoying, gets a chance to shine when, in ""The Wall,"" he demonstrates sturdy loyalty and selflessness.  There's also a good share of humor, particularly when Gary's visiting father (William Devane) finds out about the Paper and (as Gary had feared he would) immediately decides he wants to help--and actually shows a flair for the job.  A perfect mix of drama, lighthearted fun, and intriguing unanswered questions makes this a thoroughly enjoyable series that should have lasted longer than it did.",5,Local hero,1324684800,"12 24, 2011",2011,2944,"['delightfully', 'original', 'fantasy-drama', 'centers', 'Gary', 'Hobson', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'young', 'stockbroker', 'Chicago', 'Strauss', 'Associates', 'wife', 'out', 'fourth', 'anniversary', 'next', 'morning', 'doorstep', 'hotel', 'room', 'graced', 'orange', 'cat', 'piercing', 'yowl', 'motorboat', 'purr', 'copy', 'Sun-Times', 'ordinary', 'Sun-Times', 'tomorrow', 'Gary', 'little', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'here', 'when', 'realizes', 'powerful', 'tool', 'not', 'something', 'mess', 'Why', 'how', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'Sam', 'Beckett', 'ofQuantum', 'Leap', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'right', 'what', 'once', 'went', 'wrong', 'so', 'Gary', 'embarks', 'career', 'putting', 'things', 'right', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'exposing', 'political', 'corruption', 'preventing', 'crimes', 'accidents', 'traffic', 'jams', 'family', 'breakups', 'other', 'assorted', 'human', 'tragedies', 'sometimes', 'risk', 'own', 'life', 'mostly', 'local', 'scale', 'least', 'once', 'space-shuttle', 'explosion', 'once', 'nuclear', 'meltdown', 'Russia', 'once', 'complex', 'chilling', 'two-parter', 'Wall', 'involved', 'planned', 'Presidential', 'assassination', 'even', 'warnings', 'often', 'have', 'people', 'suspecting', 'being', 'meddler', 'masher', 'crank', 'best', 'kind', 'psychic', 'supported', 'occasionally', 'hindered', 'best', 'friend', 'Chuck', 'Fishman', 'Fisher', 'Stevens', 'fellow', 'stockbroker', 'former', 'college', 'roommate', 'who', 'constantly', 'tips', 'market', 'pro', 'sports', 'next', 'lottery', 'winner', 'Marissa', 'Clark', 'Shanesia', 'Davis', 'blind', 'receptionist', 'boundless', 'faith', 'tough', '30-year-veteran', 'Detective', 'Lt.', 'Zeke', 'Crumb', 'Ron', 'Dean', 'Chicago', 'PD', 'who', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'make', 'end', 'season', 'advising', 'people', 'can', 'trust', 'Chandler', 'Hobson', 'somewhat', 'reminiscent', 'many', 'James', 'Stewart', 'parts', 'same', 'aw-shucks', 'innocence', 'updated', ""'90"", 'anger', 'was', 'picked', 'job', 'even', 'knowing', 'was', 'consideration', 'often', 'bitterly', 'how', 'Paper', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'have', 'life', 'least', 'once', 'reject', 'Cat', 'bringing', 'same', 'series', 'learn', 'more', 'more', 'how', 'who', 'got', 'last', 'what', 'Cat', 'powers', 'are', 'definitely', 'strange', 'ones', 'even', 'Chuck', 'whom', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'annoying', 'chance', 'shine', 'when', 'Wall', 'sturdy', 'loyalty', 'selflessness', 'also', 'good', 'share', 'humor', 'particularly', 'when', 'Gary', 'visiting', 'father', 'William', 'Devane', 'out', 'Paper', 'Gary', 'had', 'feared', 'would', 'immediately', 'help', 'actually', 'flair', 'job', 'perfect', 'mix', 'drama', 'lighthearted', 'fun', 'intriguing', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'series', 'should', 'have', 'lasted', 'longer', 'did']",Early Edition: Season 1

1116549,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B000YA82GA,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[3, 5]","Kyle Chandler fans, rejoice!  The future ""Coach Taylor"" stars here as Gary Hobson, a Chicago stockbroker who finds his career to be soulless and dull, until fate intervenes and gives him a new calling, along with a mysterious subscription to a newspaper from the future.  Granted a chance to see tomorrow's news today, Gary chooses to transform tragedies into triumphs and help others avoid disaster, rather than use the paper to make lots of money (which is what his weasly best friend wants him to do...)This 6-DVD box set gathers the first of four seasons of ""Early Edition,"" establishing the characters and giving them room to grow.  Like most TV series, it takes a while for the actors and producers to find the right rhythm -- the show's quirky premise lends itself to formulaic episodes (Gary finds out about, then averts, various tragedies; Gary flirts with but never quite connects with one interesting, gutsy modern gal after another... Gary's friends flutter about the horizon, giving him advice and helping him save lives; Gary complains about the burden fate has placed on his shoulders.) But the mystery of the magical newspapers helps move the show forward, and Chandler is such a charming, soulful performer that any show that gives him this much screen time is a delight.""Early Edition,"" which ran from 1996-2000, has an oddly dated feel, as if it had been made in the 1980s, when TV was still under the spell of the '70s.  It recalls other episodic supernatural/timetravel-y shows, notably ""Quantum Leap"" (which also had an adventure-of-the-week, do-good-deeds premise) and the similarly quirky ""Wonderfalls,"" which also featured a likable but often cranky workaday person chosen by a higher power to fulfill a task that was never quite clearly defined and was often burdensome and unwanted. At the heart f it all is Mr. Chandler and his puppydog eyes... Fans of his work will definitely want to check this out as well... and seasons 2-4, too, if they come out on DVD as well.

In fact, if this show was airing right now, I honestly think it would be the best show on television.To start, the premise is extremely interesting and original: a Chicago man, Gary Hobson, holds the future in his hand: he mysteriously receives tomorrow's newpaper a day early.  He must make many moral decisions as to how he is going to use the paper -  for his advantange, or for other peoples' advantage.  Of course, for those who really appreciate Kyle Chandler's boyish, innocent looks, we already know he's a good guy in this.Every episode involves stories in the newspaper, mostly tragic, that Gary must try to fix or prevent.  However, such is life, where one thing is often connected to another, be it people or events, and situations are not always what they seem. Many episodes take us through exciting twists and turns, and before we know it, a 40-minute episode is sadly over.What I love about ""Early Edition"" is its tremendous heart.  I never cry when I watch television and most movies, but I think this show wins in making me tear up with gladness in more than several episodes throughout its four-year run, especially during the first season.  Episodes like ""The Choice,"" where Gary must decide who to save from death, ""Gun,"" which shows the devestating effects of a broken-up family, ""Hoops,"" and ""Faith,"" where a young girl helps Gary reevaluate the kind of faith he puts in his paper, are uplifting and helps us believe in a world that still has hope and goodness in it.  Sounds cliche, but I'll take a show that celebrates the goodness in people over ones that seem to take joy in showing heartache and violence as a result of the evil people do.Other episodes such as ""His Girl Thursday,"" ""The Wall 1+2,"" ""Psychic,"" ""Phantom at the Opera,"" and ""Love is Blind"" are exciting and at times very intense mysteries that showcase the classic ""Early Edition"" comedy and engaging story lines.  Kyle Chandler as the bumbling, kind-hearted, and adorable Gary Hobson, as well as Fisher Stevens (as best buddy Chuck) and Shanesia Davis (as blind friend Marissa), make ""Early Edition"" one of my favorite series for its high quality stories, humor, performances, and heart-felt messages.",5,"A First-Rate, High Quality Show",1219449600,"08 23, 2008",2008,2368,"['watched', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'air', 'watching', 'again', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'years', 'was', 'struck', 'how', 'well', 'still', 'up', 'decade', 'fact', 'show', 'was', 'airing', 'right', 'now', 'honestly', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'show', 'television.To', 'start', 'premise', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'original', 'Chicago', 'man', 'Gary', 'Hobson', 'future', 'hand', 'mysteriously', 'tomorrow', 'newpaper', 'day', 'early', 'must', 'make', 'many', 'moral', 'decisions', 'how', 'going', 'use', 'paper', 'advantange', 'other', 'peoples', 'advantage', 'course', 'who', 'really', 'appreciate', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'boyish', 'innocent', 'looks', 'already', 'know', 'good', 'guy', 'this.Every', 'episode', 'stories', 'newspaper', 'mostly', 'tragic', 'Gary', 'must', 'try', 'fix', 'prevent', 'However', 'such', 'life', 'where', 'one', 'thing', 'often', 'connected', 'be', 'people', 'events', 'situations', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'what', 'seem', 'Many', 'episodes', 'take', 'exciting', 'twists', 'turns', 'know', '40-minute', 'episode', 'sadly', 'love', 'Early', 'Edition', 'tremendous', 'heart', 'never', 'cry', 'when', 'watch', 'television', 'most', 'movies', 'think', 'show', 'making', 'tear', 'up', 'gladness', 'more', 'several', 'episodes', 'four-year', 'run', 'especially', 'first', 'season', 'Episodes', 'Choice', 'where', 'Gary', 'must', 'decide', 'who', 'save', 'death', 'Gun', 'devestating', 'effects', 'broken-up', 'family', 'Hoops', 'Faith', 'where', 'young', 'girl', 'Gary', 'reevaluate', 'kind', 'faith', 'paper', 'are', 'uplifting', 'believe', 'world', 'still', 'hope', 'goodness', 'cliche', ""'ll"", 'take', 'show', 'goodness', 'people', 'ones', 'seem', 'take', 'joy', 'showing', 'heartache', 'violence', 'result', 'evil', 'people', 'do.Other', 'episodes', 'such', 'Girl', 'Thursday', 'Wall', '1+2', 'Psychic', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'Love', 'Blind', 'are', 'exciting', 'times', 'very', 'intense', 'mysteries', 'showcase', 'classic', 'Early', 'Edition', 'comedy', 'engaging', 'story', 'lines', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'bumbling', 'kind-hearted', 'adorable', 'Gary', 'Hobson', 'as', 'well', 'Fisher', 'Stevens', 'best', 'Chuck', 'Shanesia', 'Davis', 'blind', 'friend', 'Marissa', 'make', 'Early', 'Edition', 'one', 'favorite', 'series', 'high', 'quality', 'stories', 'humor', 'performances', 'heart-felt', 'messages']",Early Edition: Season 1

A mysterious cat delivers the newspaper, and soon Gary realises that it's actually tomorrows newspaper.  From there, the episodes revolve around him trying to prevent the crimes or accidents he reads about.  His friend Chuck (Fisher Stevens) was hilarious as Gary's best friend and there was also Marissa.  They were the only two other people that knew about the paper.  Chuck often wanted to use the paper for his own personal gain like in the stock market or lottery or to get dates, but Gary never allowed it.My favourite episode of this season is Frostbit where Gary is stranded during a save and Chuck now has to save Gary.  I could go on and on about how good this show is, but you have to check it out for yourself.  It is so cool because it's a fantasy for a lot of people - what would you do if you could see/read the future.  It isn't always as easy as it would seem.

The problems Gary would run up against was what ever you do may have a ripple effect that you can never see coming. It kept me on the edge of my seat for and hour. Never missed it. I really liked how all characters eventualy as the season progressed became a part of Gary's team. The only draw back is we only have 2 seasons out of the 4 to purchase. I'm beginning to look twice when these kind of show are offered as a season to season purchase. I've been fooled before but never more. I will not buy unless the shows are in a complete series form. Because I bought Early Edition only when their were 2 seasons thinking only 2 more to go so they must be planing to make these available But it has been a Very long time and with No hope of season 3 and 4 being put out for purchase. I really don't think the manufacturers care because this practice is becoming more and more the norm. They waste alot of start up money when they do this. But if they would offer a complete series for these shows more would buy hence making for a more happy buyer out hear. I know I would be more apt to buy if they offered programing in it's complete form. These are shows that are no longer in production so making it a complete series would be an easy task. More purchases more profits think about it.
