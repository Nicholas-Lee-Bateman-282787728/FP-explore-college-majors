342843,A141HP4LYPWMSR,6302877814,Brian E. Erland,"[3, 3]","Synopsis: The jump from high school basketball to college ball isn't as easy as Henry Steele (Robby Benson) thought it would be. When he fails to keep up with the progress of the other players on the team Coach Moreland (G.D. Spradlin) begins to pressure Henry into renouncing his scholarship. When he refuses to quit the coach takes drastic and unethical measures to force him off the team. With the help of Janet (Annette O'Toole), his lovely tutor and potential love interest, Henry must discover whether he has the talent and determination to prove himself both on and off the basketball court.Critique: `The still waiting for a DVD release `One On One' from '77 is an entertaining teen coming-of-age film that works for adults as well. Benson and O'Toole are terrific together and G.D. Spradlin is perfect as one of those people you absolutely love to hate.

I have never been big into sports, yet I loved ONE ON ONE so very much.  Like another Amazon.com reviewer said, without being pretentious, ONE ON ONE satisfies a young person's yearning for heroes.  It was, and still is, a fantastic and inspirational story that still grabs the heart and the imagination 36 years (has it been that long?!) after it's 1977 release.  Because of it's subject matter, this film IS NOT ANTIQUATED.  The story and the wonderful performances by Robby Benson and Annette O'Toole,-- are as fresh and new as the day the film was released. I'm 52 years old now, and I still love this movie.  It's such a nice and uplifting ""blast-from-the-past"" to see the young and vibrant Robby Benson and Annette O'Toole (who, surprisingly, doesn't look, even in 2013, much older than she did in this film!) in those endearing roles (and look at those great big, winning smiles on that original movie poster!).  This is indeed ""the story of a winner,"" and I hope new generations of young people will discover ONE ON ONE and love it as much as I, and millions of other kids, did.  It may be about a college basketball player, but it's appeal cuts across all interests and generations; it's appeal is universal.  A BIG smile on my face right now.

342847,A380H0RPMMOG3E,6302877814,"E. Von Ray ""adventurer""","[3, 3]","Ok, it is not a fully cleaned up edition loaded with special features but at least it is available. I love this film for a few reasons. One, it gets basketball, and sports in general. Henry talks about the beauty of sport in a simple, genuine manner. It isn't mindless. It is a form of art. Robbie Benson is terrific in the mild-mannered, naive and driven basketball player Henry Steele. He fits the role like a glove. He is a talented basketball player to be sure, a smaller version of Pete Maravich, though many will see similarities with Larry Bird, who appeared on the national scene a few years later.Another reason is Annette O'Toole, who plays Janet Hays, Henry's tutor and eventual lover. Sorry if I spoiled that for anyone. But the cover gives it away does it not? Annette plays the role in an intelligent, arrogant, condescending, understanding, giving and eventually submissive way. She runs the gamut of emotions here and pulls it off. There are some corny lines I almost cringe at but also some truly remarkable moments. Like the one where he is sleeping and she is just watching him. Very simple and effective.Henry's coach is played almost flawlessly by G.D. Spradlin. He plays the coach not as an evil guy, not at all. In one terrific scene, he is quick to remind the 'innocent' Henry that he knew exactly what he was doing while negotiating to go to Western. The car, the steaks, the full ride, the easy money, everything. It is a pivotal scene because it shows these characters are not one dimensional.The story is simple but still powerful. I don't think I've seen a film that captures basketball so well. Sorry, Hoosiers fans. I think this film is better.I would love for Robbie Benson to sit down, maybe with Annette O'Toole and do a commentary on this film, maybe have a special edition with a making of documentary. I can hope for it. Until that time (that may never come) I will be content with this dvd version.

Benson plays Henry Steele, who leaves his small town where he was basically the greatest show on earth to attend Western University in Los Angeles (scenes were actually filmed at Moby Gym on the campus of Colorado State University).  There he discovers that Coach Moreland Smith (G.D. Spradlin) is not the same smiling guy who came recruiting him when the team is practicing.Benson could actually play basketball (i.e., make long shots and do some fancy dribbling moves), and there was actually some thought put into the game sequences.  The film deals with the ugly underside of college basketball (Henry has a campus job that pays him for the automatic sprinklers coming on) and Smith is a wonderful martinet that you will not be able to stand, but the basketball side of the equation is not what is wrong with this film.  The tagline for this movie was &quot;There comes a time when love stops being a ball and starts being a woman&quot; (I swear I did not make this up).  As long as Henry is on the coach's good side going to class is not exactly a priority; but then Smith wants him gone and now the classes matter.  Henry ends up with a tutor, Janet Hays (Annette O'Toole), who is rather surprised to find out the freshman is not a dumb jock.  Now, I can believe that Henry Steele can come off the bench in the final moments of the climatic game to save the day, but I cannot believe that he wins his tutor's heart.  I totally understand the impulse on his part, and certainly Janet's current boyfriend is a troglodyte, but Robby Benson was not that cute.This is another one of those 3.5 star films where you round up if at the end you are thinking about the basketball plot and down if you you are thinking about the romance.

An underdog, in this case, a small standout high school basketball player, enters the big time world of college basketball and is ill equipped to deal with the pressures - and the assortment of difficult characters he encounters (an underage and older woman seductress; a coach from hell; a smug intellectual, etc.). Robby Benson was an important film star for several years and made several high quality films.  This film, which he co-wrote, is probably his best (with ""The Chosen,"" another little scene film, a very close second). His characters were decent, warm, smarter than they seemed, and brave.  The love story with Annette O'Toole, who plays his college tutor, is believably drawn, and is the spine of the story of a young man's growth toward manhood. There is also plenty of humor in the story - and the basketball scenes, whether in practice or the actual games, have the feel of real college basketball, even today.  THIS FILM NEEDS TO BE ON DVD!  It's the 30th anniversary, so come on!  On ESPN classic, they showed this film with some terrific commentary by Robby Benson and others in the cast, reflecting back on the experience of making the film.  This should definitely be included in the DVD version.  It was just excellent - and brought back all the feelings I had when I first saw the film.  I was in high school too.

I was equally shy and as sensitive, in his portrayals, when I was growing up and loved his work for that reason.  It showed sensitive loving guys like me existed: That not all guys are jerks or don't have feelings for others, let alone can be hurt easily by the words of others when those words are unkind and not meant to help a person improve.I've always been an empath all my life and feel what others feel, which also makes me a sensitive.  Robby Benson had the same gift, but did a great job channeling it into the arts vindicating those of us who are like him, which is why I love his films, like I said.He always showed that you can be a great warrior with your battles in life and still not sacrafice your sensitivity toward others as you strive to live in this world and pursue your dreams to make them come true.One on One is a great simple story of one young man's battle to make his dreams real, even when he faces resistence while he works to discover himself and get ""his act together"".  In the end, he finds himself and understands the gifts he's been given which is a great message for any teenager to see and hear. In fact, its a universal message at any age in my half a century of living.The VHS tape cover was in great condition to my delight and surprise.  The VHS quality was par for what VHS was next to all the HD quality gracing the market place today.  No complaints.  Nice to watch the story again.  Excellent for the price.  Thanks for making it available on Amazon!I gave this a 5 because of the story even though the cinematography approach was different back when the film was made vs how things are done today.

342865,AGW68YZZPOK6,6302877814,Xavier Limtuaco,"[7, 7]","In 1977, my 2 younger brothers, late father and I saw two movies one after the other. The first was ""Star Wars,"" and the other was ""One on One."" This was at the old QUAD Theater in Ayala Center, Makati, Philippines. The price of movies then was P5.00 for orchestra and P10.00 for loge/balcony (now movies here cost P150.00 - P180.00 or about $3.75 at the prevailing exchange rate). I truly enjoyed ""One on One,"" not only because it had this inspiring theme about an underdog who beats the odds (something like the Rocky of basketball) but because I loved the music and the way it was interspersed with the scenes. Music played such a big part in making me appreciate this movie. I remember owning and repeatedly playing the soundtrack (on vinyl record!) at that time which I later replaced with the cd when it came out last year (or was that 2 years ago). I loved the songs performed by Seals and Crofts and I became an instant Seals and Crofts fan. The main theme ""My Fair Share"" has remained a radio favorite here in the Philippines up to now. One of my two other favorite songs in the soundtrack is ""This Day Belongs To Me"" which is played in the opening credits when Henry Steele (Robby Benson) bids his parents goodbye as he leaves home to start a new phase of his life in college. The other wonderful song ""Love Conquers All"" is played in the ending credits showing Henry and his ladylove (Annette O'Toole) playing basketball as the afternoon sun is about to set. Seeing this film again after so many years (there hasn't been any VHS copy anywhere) made me appreciate the movie even more. There is even a cameo role by a very young Melanie Griffith as a hitchhiker who extorts money from Henry. Annette O' Toole plays  Henry's beautiful tutor whom he falls in love with. I rate this dvd 5 stars based on content. My real complaint is that it took so long for this film to come out on dvd but it does not have any special features at all for something which costs a whopping $25.99! And no subtitles? Isn't this supposed to be basic in a dvd - to have subtitles at least? They could have conducted some interviews on Robby and Annette now (32 years after!) and asked them to share their insights and anecdotes in making the movie. I am sure Robby and Annette would gladly oblige to an interview. But all in all, I had nostalgic fun watching this movie again. The steep price did not prevent me from purchasing a copy. It was quite a pricey trip down memory lane but sometimes people are willing to pay the price for something worth revisiting like ""One on One"" which happens to be one of my fave movies of all time!",5,ONE OF MY FAVE MOVIES OF ALL TIME,1254700800,"10 5, 2009",2009,2620,"['1977', '2', 'younger', 'brothers', 'late', 'father', 'saw', 'two', 'movies', 'one', 'other', 'first', 'was', 'Star', 'Wars', 'other', 'was', 'One', 'One', 'was', 'old', 'QUAD', 'Theater', 'Ayala', 'Center', 'Makati', 'Philippines', 'price', 'movies', 'then', 'was', 'P5.00', 'orchestra', 'P10.00', 'loge/balcony', 'now', 'movies', 'here', 'cost', 'P150.00', 'P180.00', '3.75', 'prevailing', 'exchange', 'rate', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'One', 'One', 'not', 'only', 'had', 'inspiring', 'theme', 'underdog', 'who', 'odds', 'something', 'Rocky', 'basketball', 'loved', 'music', 'way', 'was', 'interspersed', 'scenes', 'Music', 'played', 'big', 'part', 'making', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'remember', 'owning', 'repeatedly', 'playing', 'soundtrack', 'vinyl', 'record', 'time', 'later', 'replaced', 'cd', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'last', 'year', 'was', '2', 'years', 'ago', 'loved', 'songs', 'performed', 'Seals', 'Crofts', 'became', 'instant', 'Seals', 'Crofts', 'fan', 'main', 'theme', 'Fair', 'Share', 'remained', 'radio', 'favorite', 'here', 'Philippines', 'now', 'One', 'two', 'other', 'favorite', 'songs', 'soundtrack', 'Day', 'Belongs', 'Me', 'played', 'opening', 'credits', 'when', 'Henry', 'Steele', 'Robby', 'Benson', 'parents', 'goodbye', 'home', 'start', 'new', 'phase', 'life', 'college', 'other', 'wonderful', 'song', 'Love', 'Conquers', 'All', 'played', 'ending', 'credits', 'showing', 'Henry', 'ladylove', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'playing', 'basketball', 'afternoon', 'sun', 'set', 'Seeing', 'film', 'again', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'there', ""n't"", 'been', 'VHS', 'copy', 'anywhere', 'made', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'even', 'cameo', 'role', 'very', 'young', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'hitchhiker', 'who', 'money', 'Henry', 'Annette', 'O', 'Toole', 'Henry', 'beautiful', 'tutor', 'whom', 'love', 'rate', '5', 'stars', 'based', 'content', 'real', 'complaint', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'film', 'come', 'out', 'dvd', 'not', 'have', 'special', 'features', 'something', 'whopping', '25.99', 'subtitles', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'basic', 'dvd', 'have', 'subtitles', 'least', 'could', 'have', 'conducted', 'interviews', 'Robby', 'Annette', 'now', '32', 'years', 'asked', 'share', 'insights', 'anecdotes', 'making', 'movie', 'am', 'sure', 'Robby', 'Annette', 'would', 'gladly', 'oblige', 'interview', 'had', 'nostalgic', 'fun', 'watching', 'movie', 'again', 'steep', 'price', 'did', 'not', 'prevent', 'purchasing', 'copy', 'was', 'quite', 'pricey', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'sometimes', 'people', 'are', 'willing', 'pay', 'price', 'something', 'worth', 'revisiting', 'One', 'One', 'be', 'one', 'fave', 'movies', 'time']",N/A

In fact its my favorite sports movie of all time. I've always been fond of Robby Benson and his work. In this movie he looked a little like Pistol Pete with the long hair and all (another cat I'm very fond of {rip}). I think he really did play some ball in his real life, with his heavy voice and letter bball jacket he looked the part in this film. Annete Otoole with her Irish red hair  and sexy magnetism played the part of his upper class love interest perfectly (definately alluring). It goes to show you when a woman treats you bad initially for know reason, chances are she really digs the h@#&$ out of you. I don't agree with most of the reviewers comparison to Rocky. No way this movie has a Rocky feel (not for me anyway).I am currently reading the paperback I bought for a quarter at a rummage sale, and must say its even better than the movie. It has more of a focus on his and his mother's relationship with his obsessed father. His best friend from home is featured in the book as well (he is thrown into Henry's scholarship package)but they drift apart during their freshmen year. I got about 20 pages left and I kinda don't want it to end. In the book Henry is a little more worldly than the movie Henry. I guess Henry's fresh innocence is one of the movie's appeal. I kind of wish at the movie's end they could of flashed a little of what would become of all the major characters, in summary like some other movies (did he make the pros? or be a star at his next school, did they get married, have kids, or was it just a College thing? info like that would have been great.
