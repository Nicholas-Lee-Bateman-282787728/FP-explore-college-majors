185646,A2UY5J44P2NU9D,1571323643,Charles N. Clark,"[0, 1]","I love this movie! I remember when my sister and I got for Christmas.I know there will be plenty of people saying this movie is great, but I love this video so much, I just have to review it myself.In this movie, the true meaning of Christmas is realized by Bob, Larry and other characters in a story about Christmas.After a toy seller creates a greedy frenzy with his new toy, the whole woods and beyond is ablaze with the false theory that Christmas is only about getting new gifts. However, a heroic live toy from the same line of toys that are creating such selfishness, finds himself yearning for a deeper meaning to Christmas, and begins a jountry to find out the truth, along with Bob, Larry and Juinor. The heroes discover that the true meaning of Christmas lies in love, and a certain Jesus Christ who was a pure gift to Mankind for the purpose of saving them. After hearing this news, the 4 heroes are deeply concerned. Now they know the truth about Christmas, but what about everyone else? How can they get the true meaning of Christmas to everyone on time?I can't get enough of this story, I wish all Christmas movies could be like this. We are exactly like the veggies in this story in our overlooking of Christmas values. Often we forget that Jesus is the real reason for Christmas, not getting more toys and things. I think this video addresses a common problem in our society today, we need to realize what Christmas is really about. This movie points it out in a soft way, don't let critics decieve you otherwise. You're not being hit over the head with a Bible, those critcs are just Anti-Christian.As for the critics of this video, I think you have a point the story line is short, but I say, what else do you want? This a story about finding the true meaning of Christmas, were you thinking of adding any dramatic deaths or anything? The whole story point is finding the real reason for the season, and I think it was perfect on that. I don't want a complicated, dramatic storyplot, that's not the point. Anyway, to the other people reading this, if you want a sweet movie for you kids and yourself that declares the real reason for Christmas, being Jesus Christ and God's love, then you must buy this one!",5,I wish I could give it more stars!,1227484800,"11 24, 2008",2008,2226,"['love', 'movie', 'remember', 'when', 'sister', 'got', 'Christmas.I', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'plenty', 'people', 'saying', 'movie', 'great', 'love', 'video', 'so', 'much', 'just', 'have', 'review', 'myself.In', 'movie', 'true', 'meaning', 'Christmas', 'realized', 'Bob', 'Larry', 'other', 'characters', 'story', 'Christmas.After', 'toy', 'seller', 'greedy', 'frenzy', 'new', 'toy', 'whole', 'woods', 'ablaze', 'false', 'theory', 'Christmas', 'only', 'about', 'getting', 'new', 'gifts', 'However', 'heroic', 'live', 'toy', 'same', 'line', 'toys', 'are', 'creating', 'such', 'selfishness', 'yearning', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'Christmas', 'jountry', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'Bob', 'Larry', 'Juinor', 'heroes', 'discover', 'true', 'meaning', 'Christmas', 'love', 'certain', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'who', 'was', 'pure', 'gift', 'Mankind', 'purpose', 'saving', 'hearing', 'news', '4', 'heroes', 'are', 'deeply', 'concerned', 'Now', 'know', 'truth', 'Christmas', 'what', 'everyone', 'else', 'How', 'can', 'get', 'true', 'meaning', 'Christmas', 'everyone', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'story', 'wish', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'could', 'be', 'are', 'exactly', 'veggies', 'story', 'overlooking', 'Christmas', 'values', 'forget', 'Jesus', 'real', 'reason', 'Christmas', 'not', 'getting', 'more', 'toys', 'things', 'think', 'video', 'common', 'problem', 'society', 'today', 'need', 'realize', 'what', 'Christmas', 'really', 'about', 'movie', 'out', 'soft', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'critics', 'decieve', 'otherwise', ""'re"", 'not', 'being', 'hit', 'head', 'Bible', 'critcs', 'are', 'just', 'Anti-Christian.As', 'critics', 'video', 'think', 'have', 'point', 'story', 'line', 'short', 'say', 'what', 'else', 'do', 'want', 'story', 'finding', 'true', 'meaning', 'Christmas', 'were', 'thinking', 'adding', 'dramatic', 'deaths', 'anything', 'whole', 'story', 'point', 'finding', 'real', 'reason', 'season', 'think', 'was', 'perfect', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'complicated', 'dramatic', 'storyplot', 'not', 'point', 'Anyway', 'other', 'people', 'reading', 'want', 'sweet', 'movie', 'kids', 'real', 'reason', 'Christmas', 'being', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'God', 'love', 'then', 'must', 'buy', 'one']",N/A

My little one really likes this video - it impresses the true meaning of Christmas and once again, drives it home pretty well.  Bob and Larry appear about 10 minutes into the video, not as the reviewer said at 1/2 over.  They're not the stars this time, it's Buzz-saw Louis, the toy that is trying to save Christmas.  Mr. Nezzar comes from a greedy family and he, along with his brother that owns the chocolate factory, are trying to overrule everything that is right about Christmas.  It isn't about ""getting stuff,"" but giving as Jesus did.  This is the message throughout the video once mailman George explains it to Larry, Bob, Junior and Buzz.This is a very cute video and a very important one to play during the holidays because as we all know, it's way too easy to lose the focus on why we celebrate Christmas.

It tells the  story of Jesus, ala Charlie Brown.  The Silly Song is indeed silly.  My  non-Christian friends love this tape and repeatedly asked to see it.  The  comedic writing is wonderful.

Mr. Nezzer isn't helping.  He's designed a toy, Buzz-Saw Louie, which will help feed the greed and make him rich.  But one of the Louies is convinced there's more to Christmas.  He's joined by Larry, Bob, and Junior in his search for the truth.  But, even if they find it, can they get the word out to others?I was a little surprised last night while re-watching to discover just how much I love this Veggie Tales story.  Sure, the animation could be better by today's standards.  When you remember that this was released in 1996 on a small budget, it puts things in perspective.  The story itself has the right combination of fun and surprises to be entertaining.  And anything with ""Oh, Santa,"" one of my favorite silly songs, can't be all bad.Big Idea continues to do their DVD releases right.  Mike and Phil do another interesting and entertaining commentary.  There's also a behind the scenes feature that includes interviews from some of the other 10 staff members who worked on this.  Just don't watch these two back to back as there are several stories that are repeated.  I was also thrilled to get the extra animation they did for the showing on PAX.  Unfortunately, this feature doesn't have chapter breaks, but I'm definitely glad to have the option of which way I want to watch this story each year.I've been watching this video every Christmas for several years now.
