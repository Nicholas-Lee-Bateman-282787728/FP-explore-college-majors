1063903,A3Q219FCOGZC2V,B000ODYV58,Mike McG,"[0, 0]",This is one of the best 90's shows that I remember growing up on. I used to look forward to seeing it every Saturday night on Snick. I was so excited when I saw that I had a chance to own it on DVD. And it's just like I remember it. It's basically about a goup of kids (the Midnight Society) who meet out in the woods every Saturday night & tell scary stories. The cool thing is that there's a message behind each story. It was a great show then & I'm glad to own it now for when I have kids.,5,Great 90's show,1215302400,"07 6, 2008",2008,492,"['one', 'best', '90', 'shows', 'remember', 'growing', 'up', 'used', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Saturday', 'night', 'Snick', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'when', 'saw', 'had', 'chance', 'own', 'DVD', 'just', 'remember', 'basically', 'goup', 'kids', 'Midnight', 'Society', 'who', 'meet', 'out', 'woods', 'Saturday', 'night', 'tell', 'scary', 'stories', 'cool', 'thing', 'message', 'story', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'then', ""'m"", 'glad', 'own', 'now', 'when', 'have', 'kids']",Are You Afraid of The Dark? - (Box Set) The Complete Third Season (Season 3)

One might have thought that they would stop at season 2- but it looks like all the seasons will be on dvd soon. Season 3 is better than than 1 and 2 because the episodes became more inventive and scarier. The bookish babysitter is one of the shows more popular episodes. These sets are a steal at the asking price. This show made me so happy as a kid and at the age of 25 I still find myself getting lost with the Midnight Society. Although there are no extras, lets be honest- you buy this because it is a cool show that almost never had a chance of getting to dvd. The 3 disc collections includes the following episodes.1.The tale of the Midnight Ride2.The tale of Apartment 2143.The tale of the Watcher's Woods4.The tale of the phone police5.The tale of the dollmaker6.The tale of the Bookish Babysitter7.The tale of the Carved Stone8.The tale of the Guardian's Curse9.The tale of the Curious Camera10.The tale of the Dream Girl11.The tale of the Quicksilver12.The tale of the Crimson Clown13.The tale of the Dangerous SoupSuch an inventive show for kids and adults who just want to sit down and remember what it feels like to be a kid again.",5,I bring you the tale of...,1180137600,"05 26, 2007",2007,1217,"['Oh', 'be', 'young', 'again', 'love', 'fact', 'old', 'tv', 'shows', 'are', 'dvd', 'One', 'might', 'have', 'thought', 'would', 'stop', 'season', '2-', 'seasons', 'will', 'be', 'dvd', 'soon', 'Season', '3', 'better', '1', '2', 'episodes', 'became', 'more', 'inventive', 'scarier', 'bookish', 'babysitter', 'one', 'shows', 'more', 'popular', 'episodes', 'sets', 'are', 'steal', 'asking', 'price', 'show', 'made', 'so', 'happy', 'kid', 'age', '25', 'still', 'find', 'getting', 'lost', 'Midnight', 'Society', 'are', 'extras', 'lets', 'be', 'honest-', 'buy', 'cool', 'show', 'almost', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'getting', 'dvd', '3', 'disc', 'collections', 'following', 'episodes.1.The', 'tale', 'Midnight', 'Ride2.The', 'tale', 'Apartment', '2143.The', 'tale', 'Watcher', 'Woods4.The', 'tale', 'phone', 'police5.The', 'tale', 'dollmaker6.The', 'tale', 'Bookish', 'Babysitter7.The', 'tale', 'Carved', 'Stone8.The', 'tale', 'Guardian', 'Curse9.The', 'tale', 'Curious', 'Camera10.The', 'tale', 'Dream', 'Girl11.The', 'tale', 'Quicksilver12.The', 'tale', 'Crimson', 'Clown13.The', 'tale', 'Dangerous', 'SoupSuch', 'inventive', 'show', 'kids', 'adults', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'sit', 'down', 'remember', 'what', 'be', 'kid', 'again']",Are You Afraid of The Dark? - (Box Set) The Complete Third Season (Season 3)
