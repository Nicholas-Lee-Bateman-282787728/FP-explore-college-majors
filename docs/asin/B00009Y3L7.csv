This film is a pretty damned good directorial debut from Ms. Harris. Granted, it could have been a bit better storyline wise, as it seemed a bit week in some areas, but considering this was her first time as a director, she does show a lot of potential for future directorial efforts! I definitely recommend picking this one up for your collection, especially if you're a fan of Danielle Harris or Kane Hodder, who has a cameo as a limo driver at the start of the film.",5,Among Friends,1401408000,"05 30, 2014",2014,612,"['had', 'pleasure', 'first', 'hearing', 'movie', '2', 'years', 'ago', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'when', 'met', 'Horror', 'Hound', 'Weekend', 'Columbus', 'film', 'pretty', 'damned', 'good', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Ms.', 'Harris', 'Granted', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'better', 'storyline', 'wise', 'seemed', 'bit', 'week', 'areas', 'considering', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'show', 'lot', 'potential', 'future', 'directorial', 'efforts', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'picking', 'one', 'up', 'collection', 'especially', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'Kane', 'Hodder', 'who', 'cameo', 'limo', 'driver', 'start', 'film']",N/A

Unfortunately, I find myself wickedly disappointed.  The film simply is boring, formulaic and completely unoriginal.I would give Danielle Harris even benefit of the doubt, but this film offers absolutely nothing new.  Its your standard fare revenge film, where a wronged girl dupes a bunch of bad guys into a private party and ambushes them into her revenge plot.  As the night unfolds, she introduces various evidence that ""justifies"" her actions as she does something brutal to one of the wrongdoers.The movie is not engaging on several fronts  First, to any fan of horror films, the story purely replays other far more imaginative revenge films.  Second, copy cat films can be entertaining, but this one is not; the entire story was just boring, no other word for it. Even as the story unfolds, we're left with no understanding of why the lead actor does all that she does; we are forced to merely take it for granted that her behavior makes sense, but it does not.  Very unsatisfying.  Again, there's simply nothing new of substance to justify seeing this film.On the positive, the film gives me hope for future Danielle Harris films.  While this film fails on its screenplay/script, the camera work and production was very good.  She took what must have been a very low budget and made the film seem high end, produced with high quality/big budget photography and scenes.  Well done.  I just hope she finds a better script for her next endeavor.",2,disappointment of the year!!,1377993600,"09 1, 2013",2013,1589,"['call', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'fan', 'would', 'be', 'tremendous', 'understatement', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'movie', 'paid', 'expedited', 'shipping', 'Unfortunately', 'find', 'wickedly', 'disappointed', 'film', 'simply', 'boring', 'formulaic', 'completely', 'unoriginal.I', 'would', 'give', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'even', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'film', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'new', 'standard', 'fare', 'revenge', 'film', 'where', 'wronged', 'girl', 'bunch', 'bad', 'guys', 'private', 'party', 'ambushes', 'revenge', 'plot', 'night', 'unfolds', 'various', 'evidence', 'justifies', 'actions', 'something', 'brutal', 'one', 'wrongdoers.The', 'movie', 'not', 'engaging', 'several', 'fronts', 'First', 'fan', 'horror', 'films', 'story', 'purely', 'other', 'far', 'more', 'imaginative', 'revenge', 'films', 'Second', 'copy', 'cat', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'entertaining', 'one', 'not', 'entire', 'story', 'was', 'just', 'boring', 'other', 'word', 'Even', 'story', 'unfolds', ""'re"", 'left', 'understanding', 'why', 'lead', 'actor', 'are', 'forced', 'merely', 'take', 'granted', 'behavior', 'sense', 'not', 'Very', 'unsatisfying', 'Again', 'simply', 'nothing', 'new', 'substance', 'justify', 'seeing', 'positive', 'film', 'hope', 'future', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'films', 'film', 'screenplay/script', 'camera', 'work', 'production', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'took', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'made', 'film', 'seem', 'high', 'end', 'produced', 'high', 'quality/big', 'budget', 'photography', 'scenes', 'Well', 'done', 'just', 'hope', 'better', 'script', 'next', 'endeavor']",N/A

The beginning was your typical wild-partying-getting-to-know-ya mess that's required of most horror movies. Once the film reached the start of ""the game"" and the instructions were given out by the Bernadette character, I was thinking maybe the movie took a turn for the better.  Maybe it was starting to get juicy.  But then, crash & burn all over again with more disappointment. Everything the friends were being punished for turned out to be sexual in nature...and boy, did they play some raunchy little video clips to prove it. I've seen about a billion horror movies in my lifetime so believe me when I say that I always expect some sex scenes, but I literally heard the word ""cum"" in this movie about 10 times. Sounded like a porn for a few minutes, so just a tad overboard if you ask me.  I was also disappointed when the lesbian character hallucinated that she was starring in a movie...it seemed to drag on for 15 minutes! And did Danielle Harris REALLY need to make an appearance & remind us all that she is in fact the girl from the Halloween movies?! Totally unnecessary, and I felt it made the film feel a little TOO campy. Towards the end of the movie it became obvious that scenes were being stretched out to help fill up an obviously lackluster script.  The climax left me with too many unanswered questions - I ended up feeling like I had just watched an 80 minute trailer instead of finishing the entire movie. Overall, I gave it 2 stars for the 20 minutes in the middle that I enjoyed and for the always appreciated presence of AJ Bowen :)",2,A SURPRISINGLY HORRIBLE MOVIE...,1389744000,"01 15, 2014",2014,1615,"['Let', 'say', 'really', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'movie', 'beginning', 'was', 'typical', 'wild-partying-getting-to-know-ya', 'mess', 'required', 'most', 'horror', 'movies', 'film', 'reached', 'start', 'game', 'instructions', 'were', 'given', 'out', 'Bernadette', 'character', 'was', 'thinking', 'maybe', 'movie', 'took', 'turn', 'better', 'Maybe', 'was', 'starting', 'get', 'juicy', 'then', 'crash', 'burn', 'over', 'again', 'more', 'disappointment', 'Everything', 'friends', 'were', 'being', 'punished', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'sexual', 'nature', 'boy', 'did', 'play', 'raunchy', 'little', 'video', 'clips', 'prove', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'billion', 'horror', 'movies', 'lifetime', 'so', 'believe', 'when', 'say', 'always', 'expect', 'sex', 'scenes', 'literally', 'heard', 'word', 'cum', 'movie', '10', 'times', 'Sounded', 'porn', 'few', 'minutes', 'so', 'just', 'tad', 'overboard', 'ask', 'was', 'also', 'disappointed', 'when', 'lesbian', 'character', 'hallucinated', 'was', 'starring', 'movie', 'seemed', 'drag', '15', 'minutes', 'did', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'REALLY', 'need', 'make', 'appearance', 'remind', 'fact', 'girl', 'Halloween', 'movies', 'Totally', 'unnecessary', 'felt', 'made', 'film', 'feel', 'little', 'TOO', 'campy', 'end', 'movie', 'became', 'obvious', 'scenes', 'were', 'being', 'stretched', 'out', 'help', 'fill', 'up', 'obviously', 'lackluster', 'script', 'climax', 'left', 'too', 'many', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'ended', 'up', 'feeling', 'had', 'just', 'watched', '80', 'minute', 'trailer', 'instead', 'finishing', 'entire', 'movie', 'Overall', 'gave', '2', 'stars', '20', 'minutes', 'middle', 'enjoyed', 'always', 'appreciated', 'presence', 'AJ', 'Bowen']",N/A

759593,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B00009Y3L7,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[3, 3]","About 10 years ago I reviewed a DVD from Producer Mark Waldrep's AIX record label, featuring string-wizard John McEuen. It featured HD sound and HD video, as well as a feature that let you choose the camera angle. (All this was before the advent of Bluray.)This DVD (not BD) - recorded in January 2003 in a concert hall at Coburn School for Performing Arts in Los Angeles- takes sound engineer Waldrep's product to an even higher level (technically). He's covered Country - with a recent DVD by Mark Chestnut (see my review on Amazon) and here he has vocal jazz.!Cheryl Bentyne is one of the four members of the ""vocalese"" group The Manhattan Transfer. While she wasn't one of the original members, she joined them by their 2nd LP. Beginning early in this decade the members went off to do solo projects (this is one) but still get together to tour and make an occasional album. For this special session, arranged by Waldrep, Bentyne is accompanied by long time friends including pianist Corey Allen, who backed her on tour and then married her! Guitar, bass and drums fill out the group. The songs range from standards like ""It Might As Well Be Spring"" and ""They Can't Take That Away From Me"" to Annie Ross's ""Farmer's Market"". Ross was the original vocalese ""girl singer"" (as part of Lambert, Hendricks  & Ross) and Bentyne gets to ""vocalese here on this number.From a musical entertainment viewpoint, the DVD disc succeeds. But there's more - especially for those with high-end equipment - which I don't. On the DVD special features you can learn about each of the musicians, read their discographies and wach 2-5 minute interviews with each of them. There are some short clips of ""rehearsal footage"" and for one song you can choose various camera angles. There are multiple pages of ""How to use the disc"" (well beyond the capabilities of my simple setup) and lots of tekkie info.The images were sharp and sound excellent on my 30 year-old standard-def TV. From an audio standpoint, Waldrep records and mixes the sound from various perspectives - just like the camera angles. In the ""Setup"" menu you can choose from the ""Stage"" perspective, the ""Audience"" perspective or a ""combined ""S&A;"" one.As noted above the DVD is dual sided. Most folks will use the ""blue side"" which has the features I covered above. But the ""red side"" contains the ""Audience Mix"" in hi-def. As I said this only plays in special DVD-Audio players. Since I don't have that equipment, I wasn't able to accomplish this.1.I've enjoyed the recent BD releases of performances by guitarist Albert Lee and singer-songwriter John Gorka (see my reviews of these on Amazon) and this is another winner. Both Manhattan Transfer fans and lovers of good vocals will want to know about it. The label was just picked up by NAXOS distributing so it's getting a wider release in 2012.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,Member of Manhattan Transfer swings in HD video and GREAT sound with MANY audio options!,1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,2933,"['10', 'years', 'ago', 'reviewed', 'DVD', 'Producer', 'Mark', 'Waldrep', 'AIX', 'record', 'label', 'featuring', 'string-wizard', 'John', 'McEuen', 'featured', 'HD', 'sound', 'HD', 'video', 'as', 'well', 'feature', 'let', 'choose', 'camera', 'angle', 'was', 'advent', 'Bluray', 'DVD', 'not', 'BD', 'recorded', 'January', '2003', 'concert', 'hall', 'Coburn', 'School', 'Performing', 'Arts', 'Los', 'Angeles-', 'sound', 'Waldrep', 'product', 'even', 'higher', 'level', 'technically', 'covered', 'Country', 'recent', 'DVD', 'Mark', 'Chestnut', 'see', 'review', 'Amazon', 'here', 'vocal', 'jazz', 'Cheryl', 'Bentyne', 'one', 'four', 'members', 'vocalese', 'group', 'Manhattan', 'Transfer', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'original', 'members', 'joined', '2nd', 'LP', 'Beginning', 'early', 'decade', 'members', 'went', 'do', 'solo', 'projects', 'one', 'still', 'get', 'together', 'tour', 'make', 'occasional', 'album', 'special', 'session', 'arranged', 'Waldrep', 'Bentyne', 'accompanied', 'long', 'time', 'friends', 'including', 'pianist', 'Corey', 'Allen', 'who', 'backed', 'tour', 'then', 'married', 'Guitar', 'bass', 'drums', 'fill', 'out', 'group', 'songs', 'range', 'standards', 'Might', 'As', 'Well', 'Be', 'Spring', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Take', 'Away', 'Me', 'Annie', 'Ross', 'Farmer', 'Market', 'Ross', 'was', 'original', 'vocalese', 'girl', 'singer', 'part', 'Lambert', 'Hendricks', 'Ross', 'Bentyne', 'vocalese', 'here', 'number.From', 'musical', 'entertainment', 'viewpoint', 'DVD', 'disc', 'more', 'especially', 'high-end', 'equipment', 'do', ""n't"", 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'can', 'learn', 'musicians', 'read', 'discographies', 'wach', '2-5', 'minute', 'interviews', 'are', 'short', 'clips', 'rehearsal', 'footage', 'one', 'song', 'can', 'choose', 'various', 'camera', 'angles', 'are', 'multiple', 'pages', 'How', 'use', 'disc', 'well', 'capabilities', 'simple', 'setup', 'lots', 'tekkie', 'info.The', 'images', 'were', 'sharp', 'sound', 'excellent', '30', 'year-old', 'standard-def', 'TV', 'audio', 'standpoint', 'Waldrep', 'records', 'mixes', 'sound', 'various', 'perspectives', 'just', 'camera', 'Setup', 'menu', 'can', 'choose', 'Stage', 'perspective', 'Audience', 'perspective', 'combined', 'S', 'A', 'noted', 'DVD', 'dual', 'sided', 'Most', 'folks', 'will', 'use', 'blue', 'side', 'features', 'covered', 'red', 'side', 'Audience', 'Mix', 'hi-def', 'said', 'only', 'special', 'DVD-Audio', 'players', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'equipment', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'accomplish', 'this.1.I', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'recent', 'BD', 'releases', 'performances', 'guitarist', 'Albert', 'Lee', 'singer-songwriter', 'John', 'Gorka', 'see', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'winner', 'Manhattan', 'Transfer', 'fans', 'lovers', 'good', 'vocals', 'will', 'want', 'know', 'label', 'was', 'just', 'picked', 'up', 'NAXOS', 'distributing', 'getting', 'wider', 'release', '2012.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A

It would appear to be, on the surface, a similar hash of the tired torture horror that has been overdone since the endless Saw sequels and Hostel ripoffs but it actually brings some fresh air to the subject. The story revolves around a group of 6 friends who have come to a 80's themed party hosted by their friend Bernadette. They are drugged by one of the group and forced to see their sins displayed and they have to answer for them. You see them violate the trusts of others and they violate each other to the deepest core. Before the night is over none of them will ever be the same if they can make it through the night. Ms. Harris called in all of her friends to help with this one and you can see she has a very talented group of friends. Standout performances from Alyssa Lobit, AJ Bowen, and Brianne Davis. Abley supported by Jennifer Blanc-Biehn, Christopher Backus, Kamala Jones, Chris Meyer, Dana Daurey, and Kane Hodder as the limo driver.
