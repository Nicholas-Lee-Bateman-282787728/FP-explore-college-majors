Just the right mix of humor and gospel...I'm not particularly religious and I still love it!

When I buy a Gaither Gospel Series video, I expect to see and hear plenty of the Homecoming Friends harmonizing with whatever guest personalities happen to be present.  This one was way too short on homecoming friends! Watching/hearing George Jones work his way through old hymns isn't my idea of Country Bluegrass. Furthermore, this video was produced without Gloria Gaither, and she was SORELY MISSED! I was sadly disappointed in this video.",2,Not up to snuff,1221350400,"09 14, 2008",2008,471,"['What', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'When', 'buy', 'Gaither', 'Gospel', 'Series', 'video', 'expect', 'see', 'hear', 'plenty', 'Homecoming', 'Friends', 'harmonizing', 'guest', 'personalities', 'happen', 'be', 'present', 'one', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'short', 'homecoming', 'friends', 'Watching/hearing', 'George', 'Jones', 'work', 'way', 'old', 'hymns', ""n't"", 'idea', 'Country', 'Bluegrass', 'Furthermore', 'video', 'was', 'produced', 'Gloria', 'Gaither', 'was', 'SORELY', 'MISSED', 'was', 'sadly', 'disappointed', 'video']",N/A
1173554,A2RWGW6TGUX7E5,B001C0GYVG,"Gary Covington ""Southern Rocker""","[12, 13]","THIS IS A VERY GOOD,(and also ""Great"") HOMECOMING CONCERT DVD. The atmosphere, or at least the background props are great and go along with the music performed. This is one of those dvd's that seems to grow on you the more you watch it. After watching it some more, I think it might very well be a 5 star concert, it just depends on who is watching it I guess. It does have some real ""gems"" in it.It consists of 21 songs, and a song during the credits part.It contains approximately 95 minutes of music. It features performances from: Vince Gill, the Gaither Vocal Band, The Issacs, Marty Stuart and his Fabulous Superlatives, Ralph Stanley, George Jones, The Grascals, Dailey Vincent, Cherryholmes, the Easters, Gordon Mote, Jimmy Fortune, Rhonda Vincent, Larry Sparks, Doyle Lawson & Quicksilver,  and many others.The Issacs do an outstanding job on the song ""Walk On"" in their performance, they seem to be making a reference to the lengendary bluesman Robert Johnson, because in the song they sing - ""If the devil is at the crossroads waiting to make you a deal - Walk On!!! - Don't Stop""I'm referring to the story about Robert Johnson selling his soul to the devil at the crossroads in return for guitar playing greatness.Marty Stuart and his Fabulous Superlatives are excellent bluegrass musicians and they harmonize very well together.Doyle Lawson and Quicksilver are excellent bluegrass musicians also!!!George Jones does a great job singing his songs and gives great testimony about calling for Vestal Goodman, when he was in the hospital recovering from a bad auto accident. This is followed by a song with the theme of ""Call on Me - when you're ready to find JESUS"".Also you get Vince Gill performing his special song ""Go Rest High on that Mountain"". After he ends it, the congregation joins in singing the song.The other musicians are very good also, but the ones mentioned above really stoodout for me.Also, you get 2 additional bonus songs.This dvd is more country music oriented than the Bill Gathier ""Gospel Bluegrass Homecoming "" dvd's. However, I recommend both series.",4,"Bill Gather ""Country Bluegrass Homecoming"" Vol. 1",1224979200,"10 26, 2008",2008,2086,"['THIS', 'VERY', 'GOOD', 'also', 'Great', 'HOMECOMING', 'CONCERT', 'DVD', 'atmosphere', 'least', 'background', 'props', 'are', 'great', 'go', 'along', 'music', 'performed', 'one', 'dvd', 'grow', 'more', 'watch', 'watching', 'more', 'think', 'might', 'very', 'well', 'be', '5', 'star', 'concert', 'just', 'who', 'watching', 'guess', 'have', 'real', 'gems', 'it.It', 'consists', '21', 'songs', 'song', 'credits', 'part.It', 'contains', 'approximately', '95', 'minutes', 'music', 'performances', 'Vince', 'Gill', 'Gaither', 'Vocal', 'Band', 'Issacs', 'Marty', 'Stuart', 'Fabulous', 'Superlatives', 'Ralph', 'Stanley', 'George', 'Jones', 'Grascals', 'Dailey', 'Vincent', 'Cherryholmes', 'Easters', 'Gordon', 'Mote', 'Jimmy', 'Fortune', 'Rhonda', 'Vincent', 'Larry', 'Sparks', 'Doyle', 'Lawson', 'Quicksilver', 'many', 'others.The', 'Issacs', 'do', 'outstanding', 'job', 'song', 'Walk', 'performance', 'seem', 'be', 'making', 'reference', 'lengendary', 'bluesman', 'Robert', 'Johnson', 'song', 'sing', 'devil', 'crossroads', 'waiting', 'make', 'deal', 'Walk', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Stop', ""'m"", 'referring', 'story', 'Robert', 'Johnson', 'selling', 'soul', 'devil', 'crossroads', 'return', 'guitar', 'playing', 'greatness.Marty', 'Stuart', 'Fabulous', 'Superlatives', 'are', 'excellent', 'bluegrass', 'musicians', 'harmonize', 'very', 'well', 'together.Doyle', 'Lawson', 'Quicksilver', 'are', 'excellent', 'bluegrass', 'musicians', 'also', 'George', 'Jones', 'great', 'job', 'singing', 'songs', 'great', 'testimony', 'calling', 'Vestal', 'Goodman', 'when', 'was', 'hospital', 'recovering', 'bad', 'auto', 'accident', 'followed', 'song', 'theme', 'Call', 'Me', 'when', ""'re"", 'ready', 'find', 'JESUS', '.Also', 'get', 'Vince', 'Gill', 'performing', 'special', 'song', 'Go', 'Rest', 'High', 'Mountain', 'congregation', 'singing', 'song.The', 'other', 'musicians', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'also', 'ones', 'mentioned', 'really', 'stoodout', 'me.Also', 'get', '2', 'additional', 'bonus', 'songs.This', 'dvd', 'more', 'country', 'music', 'oriented', 'Bill', 'Gathier', 'Gospel', 'Bluegrass', 'Homecoming', 'dvd', 'However', 'recommend', 'series']",N/A
