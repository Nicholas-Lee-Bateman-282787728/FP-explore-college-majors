I am only rating this one a 4 out of 5 because there were actually some parts of the DVD that I did not think were that funny.  On all of the previous four DVDs, he had me laughing to the point of tears pretty much throughout the ENTIRE comedy routine.  He is that funny.  On this most recent comedy routine, there were a few jokes that I did not really think were as funny as previous material.  It must be getting very challenging for him to produce new and exciting material year after year.  I would still love to see him in person.
