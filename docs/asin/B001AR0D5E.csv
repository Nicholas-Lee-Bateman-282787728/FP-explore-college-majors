This was an ITV telefilm (240 minutes) that was later edited for DVD (106 minutes) and has now been re-released at 188 minutes.The original (very poorly) edited version received scathing reviews, and deservedly so. Most people watching didn't realise they were seeing something that had been hacked to bits. Now the full version is out and, although lengthy, it at least bridges some of the gaps in logic that were created by the hatchet job. That being said, this is not the best movie ever made but it does have its good points (effects, cast, and a decent plot). It was originally broadcast in two halves so that may be the best way to watch it.",3,DVD Re-release Includes Additional Footage,1221523200,"09 16, 2008",2008,773,"['Contrary', 'description', 'not', 'first', 'time', 'released', 'DVD', 'second', 'more', 'better', 'was', 'ITV', 'telefilm', '240', 'minutes', 'was', 'later', 'edited', 'DVD', '106', 'minutes', 'now', 'been', 're-released', '188', 'minutes.The', 'original', 'very', 'poorly', 'edited', 'version', 'received', 'scathing', 'reviews', 'deservedly', 'so', 'Most', 'people', 'watching', 'did', ""n't"", 'realise', 'were', 'seeing', 'something', 'had', 'been', 'hacked', 'bits', 'Now', 'full', 'version', 'out', 'lengthy', 'least', 'bridges', 'gaps', 'logic', 'were', 'created', 'hatchet', 'job', 'being', 'said', 'not', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'have', 'good', 'points', 'effects', 'cast', 'decent', 'plot', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'two', 'halves', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'way', 'watch']",N/A
