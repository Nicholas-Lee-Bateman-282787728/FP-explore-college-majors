Although I liked the character Tasha Yar a lot and didn't think she should have left, if they did have to kill her off, surely there are better ways than death by a  giant oil slick?Instead of her being killed honourably in the line of  duty, her death seemed meaningless and took a back seat to other events in  this episode, such as Troi being trapped in the shuttle, and Picard's  negotiation with the creature, Armus, itself.I've only forgiven The  Powers That Be because this was the first time a really major character got  killed off (Except for Spock who supposedly died in Wrath of Kahn and then  under went an amazing resurrection in Search for Spock). But then, Jadzia  Dax's death wasn't handled much better.The one nice bit about this  episode is Tasha's goodbye speech at the end, which was really sweet and  touching, and brought a breath of fresh air into an otherwise poor episode.  Other than that, it was an awful send off for a good character.  'Yesterday's Enterprise' was a much better attempt.I only got this  episode because I'm a collecter, and I'm a fan of the character Tasha Yar.

328338,A1S3C5OFU508P3,6302703646,Charles Ashbacher,"[0, 0]","This episode is memorable only for the demise of Tasha Yar and the holodeck scene where she says goodbye to her friends. A shuttle-containing counselor Troi crashes on Varga 2 and the Enterprise rushes to assist. When the landing party arrives on the surface, they are confronted by a mobile oil slick called Armus. He prevents them from reaching the shuttle containing Troi and the pilot and in a fit of pique, kills Tasha. Phaser fire is ineffective against him, so the landing party is powerless.Armus begins speaking to Troi, so using her empathic ability; she is able to learn something about him. Picard beams down to the surface in an attempt to negotiate with Armus, but he does little more than play childish pranks on them. Fortunately, the Enterprise crew discovers that when Armus is angry, the force field that he has created is weakened. Therefore, they frustrate him to the extent that all he can do is scream with rage, which lowers the strength of the field to the point where the landing party can beam off the surface.I consider Armus to be one of the most poorly thought out aliens to appear in TNG. He has no redeeming qualities, apparently he is the evil essence that a species culled from their being and then abandoned on the planet. While the idea of an evil life force does have many interesting possibilities, in this case, it is not well implemented. The idea that a being powerful enough to resist concentrated phaser fire and possessing intelligence would simply stand and scream with rage is difficult to believe.The final scene is a very emotional one, where a pre-recorded holographic image of Tasha says goodbye to her friends on the Enterprise. At the end, Data expresses puzzlement over the funeral, noting that all of his thoughts are about himself and not Tasha. He asks Picard if he perhaps has missed the point of the funeral, to which Picard replies that no, he has in fact gotten it. However, this is not enough to save the episode, and I rank it in the bottom ten percent of the series.",3,"Moving ending, rather ineffective getting there",1097884800,"10 16, 2004",2004,2029,"['episode', 'memorable', 'only', 'demise', 'Tasha', 'Yar', 'holodeck', 'scene', 'where', 'goodbye', 'friends', 'shuttle-containing', 'counselor', 'Troi', 'crashes', 'Varga', '2', 'Enterprise', 'rushes', 'assist', 'When', 'landing', 'party', 'arrives', 'surface', 'are', 'confronted', 'mobile', 'oil', 'slick', 'called', 'Armus', 'reaching', 'shuttle', 'containing', 'Troi', 'pilot', 'fit', 'pique', 'Tasha', 'Phaser', 'fire', 'ineffective', 'landing', 'party', 'powerless.Armus', 'begins', 'speaking', 'Troi', 'so', 'using', 'empathic', 'ability', 'able', 'learn', 'something', 'Picard', 'beams', 'down', 'surface', 'attempt', 'negotiate', 'Armus', 'little', 'more', 'play', 'childish', 'pranks', 'Fortunately', 'Enterprise', 'crew', 'discovers', 'when', 'Armus', 'angry', 'force', 'field', 'created', 'weakened', 'Therefore', 'frustrate', 'extent', 'can', 'do', 'scream', 'rage', 'strength', 'field', 'point', 'where', 'landing', 'party', 'can', 'beam', 'off', 'surface.I', 'consider', 'Armus', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'poorly', 'thought', 'out', 'aliens', 'appear', 'TNG', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'apparently', 'evil', 'essence', 'species', 'culled', 'being', 'then', 'abandoned', 'planet', 'idea', 'evil', 'life', 'force', 'have', 'many', 'interesting', 'possibilities', 'case', 'not', 'well', 'implemented', 'idea', 'being', 'powerful', 'enough', 'resist', 'concentrated', 'phaser', 'fire', 'possessing', 'intelligence', 'would', 'simply', 'stand', 'scream', 'rage', 'difficult', 'believe.The', 'final', 'scene', 'very', 'emotional', 'one', 'where', 'pre-recorded', 'holographic', 'image', 'Tasha', 'goodbye', 'friends', 'Enterprise', 'end', 'Data', 'puzzlement', 'funeral', 'noting', 'thoughts', 'are', 'not', 'Tasha', 'Picard', 'perhaps', 'missed', 'point', 'funeral', 'Picard', 'fact', 'gotten', 'However', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'episode', 'rank', 'bottom', 'ten', 'percent', 'series']","Star Trek - The Next Generation, Episode 22: Skin Of Evil VHS"

It inflicts mental torture on all those it meets: Troi, Riker, Crusher, Geordi, and even Data. And it kills Yar, just because it can.This wasn't a bad concept for an episode, but it fell rather flat. The special effects are sub par, the dialogue often clunky, and the pacing is jerky due to action on the planet being broken up by certain other events that the director felt needed lingering over.The ending fell flat for me, too. Picard's admission that he did not know whether he, too, had found pleasure in being cruel was a bit of a cop-out. And Tasha's farewell . . . yes, it was moving. But she had appeared so little in the series, to such limited effect, that all those farewell messages held no resonance with anything that had been seen in previous episodes.It's a fine idea to have someone die in the middle of a mission, with everyone else left behind needing to carry on.

The Enterprise, the flagship of the Federation fleet, only has one batch of Dilithium crystals, so when they're being aligned, it's tough cookies if you need to go to warp. No back up crystals - very interesting.Troi's shuttle experiences a systems failure and plummets to the surface on an unihabited planet, Vagra 2.  Who names these planets? Vagra is such a good name that you need a Vagra 1 AND a Vagra 2?Once the crystals are realigned, the Enterprise goes on a rescue mission. They beam to the crash site, only to have a thick oil slick in their path. As they try to walk around it, the oil slick follows them. No readings show up on their instruments, but it's obvious that there is an intelligence there.An ancient race of titans found a way to extract evil from their society (kinda like popping a pimple) and when all the members of the race had collected all their evil goo together, it made Armus - the oil slick... aka - the ""skin of evil.""They abandoned him on the planet - a being that is immortal and cannot die, a being utterly lonely, very powerful (he is able kill with a thought, transport an object from one place to another and he is empathic like Troi), and eager to leave the loneliness of his planet.Armus claims that his behavior is not merely evil - but that rather he IS evil - the embodiment of evil.In an act of boredom, he kills Lt. Tasha Yar, regretting later that she did not suffer because her death did not amuse him like he thought it would.  Her memorial service is sweet and touching, and elements of this scene show up in future episodes... and Tasha does make a reappearance in a future time-travelling episode.The goal is to get Troi and her shuttle pilot off the surface, but Armus continues to envelop the shuttle and they are unable to get a lock on the occupants. What's ironic is that Armus can beam (or at least teleport) Picard in and out of the shuttle, but he apparently can't beam Troi or Ben (the injured pilot) out, nor enter it himself. Yes, there are holes-a-plenty in this episode.Continued dialogue with Armus reveals the nature of his lonliness and desire to leave. His voice is ominous and his flippant attitude toward life is creepy.Not a great episode by a long shot, but a pivotal one for those who watch a lot of the episodes - this one has important elements for a number of future episodes that refer back to it.

""Pop Culture Addict""","[0, 0]","Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby) exits Star Trek:  The Next Generation in ""Skin of Evil"" and you cannot help but wonder why the writers did not give her a better send-off.  Surely, the character deserved a better fate than being done in by a giant ink blot.The Enterprise-D attempts to rescue the crew of a crashed shuttle on planet Vagra II.  Their efforts are impeded by a living mass of black goo named Armus (Mart McChesney).  Armus torments the away team sent to the planet and swiftly kills Yar when she attempts to make her way to the shuttle.  Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) subsequently beams down to the planet himself to try and resolve the standoff.  He discovers that Armus can be overcome by directing taunts back toward him.  Picard does so and the away team and the occupants of the shuttle escape back to the Enterprise-D.  The crew then sadly assembles on the ship's holodeck to listen to a farewell message Yar had previously recorded.""Skin of Evil"" is no ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"" (1982).  Yar is not dispatched in a spectacular and memorable manner.  In fact, her death is exact polar opposite - feeble and forgettable.  Making matters worse is that the bulk of the episode is painful to watch.  The games played by Armus on the away team are childish and the dialogue spoken between the adversaries is stiff and groan-inducing.  The one saving grace is the farewell message delivered by Yar to her fellow crewmates.  Her parting words are touching and full of emotion.  Yet, ""Skin of Evil"" is still a clunker when taken as a whole.
