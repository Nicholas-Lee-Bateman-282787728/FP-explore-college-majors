431648,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6304681372,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[16, 31]","I must admit, I wasn't sure what I was getting into when this film arrived at my doorstep.  With pensiveness in my eyes, I placed the DVD into my player and watched ... surprisingly ... a play unfold before my eyes.  I knew it was a play, but I didn't realize this was nothing more than the stage version placed in DVD format.  With no special features, I dived directly into the action.  Song after song, joke after joke, familiar story line crossed with unfamiliar stories, I patiently waited to explore the finale of this extremely creative play.  With an hour and a half down, I thought the film was over.  I didn't see what the excitement was about, it was creative, but not shockingly bold ... then the second act began and my jaw dropped.  Darkness finally crept into these fairy tales and opened a fresh new door for our dated characters to explore.I must give tons of credit to Stephen Sondheim's creative mind.  Without his ability to dive deeper within a story than imaginable, I do not think there would have been much desire for me to sit through this three-hour epic.  Thankfully, Sondheim has this ability to constantly keep you guessing.  There were not many scenes in this performance that seemed stale, or overused.  There were clean and creative moments that kept you guessing until the very end.  I kept my eyes glued to the screen because I never knew which direction Sondheim was going to take next.  Was he going to follow classic form, or branch away into a powerful new area that has yet to be explored?  Thankfully, he broke away and created a story that set in motion the several thousands of other fairy tale rediscoveries.Coupled with Sondheim's powerful penmanship, we also have James Lapine's amazing direction.  With a film like this, basically taking a live-performance and releasing it on DVD, there was that opportunity to go extremely stale and find yourself watching what looks like a ""high school"" parent's videotaped production.  This version has extremely crisp editing, you can see the actors, you can hear what they are saying, and it feels as if you are right on the front row watching these powerful performances unfold in front of you.  Lapine does an excellent job with his positions of the cameras and ability to focus on exactly whom we need to be watching.  He keeps us centered on the story and characters without constantly reminding us that it is a play.  He does a great job of taking us into the story, away from the stage, and giving us life away from the theater.  If you force yourself to accept that it is only a play, than you will see the stage, the stagehands, and everything else that follows live theater, but if you get swept away into the songs, characters, and story, as I did, then you will see a fairy tale unfold in front of you.While I did enjoy the quality of the DVD and the creativity of Stephen Sondheim, there were some elements that I just could not escape.  One happened to be the songs.  While I loved the opening songs of the first act, in fact finding myself tapping my toes to several of the melodies, the second act felt as if I was listening to the same songs over and over again.  The second act became repetitious to me.  The songs, as well as the length, just seemed to be a bit overwhelming.  I found my mind wandering, when I wanted to focus on what was happening on screen.  I think this is because of the different versions of the SAME song coupled with elongated speeches.  This may sound weird, but I loved the second act.  It was dark, spooky, and showed a new side to fairytales that we had not been accustomed to exploring.  Yet, I hated the second act as well.  It just seemed to drag on and on without a true direction in sight.  I understood what needed to happen, but it just didn't feel as crisp as the opening act.  The characters seemed a bit stale, the surroundings seemed a bit boring, and I just felt as if it had lost some of the creative genius that I witnessed in the opening act.  While I hate to blame anyone (especially after the lesson learned in this film), but there was too much focus on Bernadette Peters, who was the obvious star of the play.  This was an ensemble performance and needed to be treated as such.  The second act focused a bit too much on Peters' Witch characters while it needed to explore everyone's emotions equally.  Outside of these two issues, I felt this was a fun, fantastical film that introduced me into a new chapter of fairy tales.Overall, I was impressed.  I really desire to see the play now, but don't know if I can sit through another 2.5 hour performance.  It was great, but not worthy of another viewing.  While I loved the creativity and the DVD transfer, I felt that the second act of this play was a bit sloppy.  It needed to be tightened, strengthened around the darkness of the characters, and everyone brought together as a group, instead of individually.  The ending smelled a bit cheesy, but allowed for all resolutions to be solved.  There is so much that I loved about the second act (like the darkness and the chaos surrounding indestructible storybook characters), but there were equally the same amount of dislikes that spawned from the second act.  Good, but not great, powerful, yet didn't seem to drive that nail home.  Applauding Sondheim and Lapine, penalizing Peters and the uncreative repetitions of the songs.Grade: *** out of *****",3,Dwarves are very upsetting.,1125878400,"09 5, 2005",2005,5402,"['must',

In the first segment of this brilliant musical the audience learns of each character longing for something: Cinderella: A prince, Jack: His cow, Milky White, Jack's mother: Her son to quit being so dependent on a cow (and to figure out Milky White is a GIRL), the Baker: A child, his wife: again, a child and maybe some more bread.  It's simle just as the originals are.  Other characters stroll in, including Rapunzel, her prince, Cinderella's prince, a witch, a wolf, Little Red Riding Hood and a hoord of fairy tale creatures.  And, like the originals follow the tales fairly well just intertwining them.But, the funny thing, aside from the actually stories are the dysfunctional problems these people have!  Cinderella: She's compulsive but regrets her decisions in the end; Jack: co-dependent on an animal and can't gain his man-hood; His mother: Can't let her son go; the Baker: Come on all guys want to keep their lineage no matter what! His wife: thinks a baby will keep her marriage together and ends up ruining it wih Conderella's prince; Rapunzel: Severe depression; the Witch: over-bearing mother who lives through her child.And on and on...This musical is so funny and such great performances!  Joanna Gleason really shines as the Baker's wife as a sort of sarcastic, take no guff girl with a romantic underside as she gets seduced (willingly) by the Prince and a soft side for her husband (Moments in the Woods).  Bernadette Peters is great too (as usual) and I love how she talks to the audience.It's truly a great musical!&quot;This is ridiculous, what am I doing here, I'm in the wrong story!&quot;",5,Once upon a Time...,1023667200,"06 10, 2002",2002,1741,"['quot', 'wish', 'more', 'anything', 'more', 'life', 'quot', 'soprano', 'Cinderella', 'tying', 'Jack', 'Baker', 'wife', 'first', 'segment', 'brilliant', 'musical', 'audience', 'learns', 'character', 'longing', 'something', 'Cinderella', 'prince', 'Jack', 'cow', 'Milky', 'White', 'Jack', 'mother', 'son', 'quit', 'being', 'so', 'dependent', 'cow', 'figure', 'out', 'Milky', 'White', 'GIRL', 'Baker', 'child', 'wife', 'again', 'child', 'maybe', 'more', 'bread', 'simle', 'just', 'originals', 'are', 'Other', 'characters', 'stroll', 'including', 'Rapunzel', 'prince', 'Cinderella', 'prince', 'witch', 'wolf', 'Little', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'hoord', 'fairy', 'tale', 'creatures', 'originals', 'follow', 'tales', 'fairly', 'well', 'just', 'intertwining', 'them.But', 'funny', 'thing', 'aside', 'actually', 'stories', 'are', 'dysfunctional', 'problems', 'people', 'have', 'Cinderella', 'compulsive', 'decisions', 'end', 'Jack', 'co-dependent', 'animal', 'ca', ""n't"", 'gain', 'man-hood', 'mother', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'son', 'go', 'Baker', 'Come', 'guys', 'want', 'keep', 'lineage', 'matter', 'what', 'wife', 'baby', 'will', 'keep', 'marriage', 'together', 'up', 'ruining', 'wih', 'Conderella', 'prince', 'Rapunzel', 'Severe', 'depression', 'Witch', 'over-bearing', 'mother', 'who', 'child.And', 'musical', 'so', 'funny', 'such', 'great', 'performances', 'Joanna', 'Gleason', 'really', 'Baker', 'wife', 'sort', 'sarcastic', 'take', 'guff', 'girl', 'romantic', 'underside', 'seduced', 'willingly', 'Prince', 'soft', 'side', 'husband', 'Moments', 'Woods', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'great', 'too', 'usual', 'love', 'how', 'audience.It', 'truly', 'great', 'musical', 'quot', 'ridiculous', 'what', 'am', 'doing', 'here', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'story', 'quot']",Into the Woods VHS
431652,A3VPMPH772HJ81,6304681372,"A. R. Karpe ""ARKendall""","[9, 10]","On the surface it sounds silly and simplistic: Cinderella and her Prince, Little Red Ridinghood, her Granny and The Wolf, Jack and his Beanstalk, Rupunzel, a Witch, a Baker and his Wife all come together in an enchanted wood to play out their famous stories...and then we get to see what happened AFTER the &quot;happily ever after.&quot;  But &quot;Into the Woods&quot; is anything but silly or simplistic.  It is one of Sondheim's funniest and cleverest scores and this DVD version blessedly captures the sterling performances of the original Broadway cast headed by the incomparable Bernadette Peters, Chip Zien and Tony Award winner Joanna Gleason as the Baker's Wife.  Sondheim and James Lapine dig deep and make us take a look at the consequences of getting what we wish for, since there truly is a price for everything, and the &quot;ripple effect&quot; of our desires touch the world in ways we may never imagine.  It is also a musical about accepting loss and moving forward (a common theme in Sondheim scores, but one eloquently explored here in heartfelt numbers such as &quot;Children Will Listen&quot; and &quot;No One Is Alone.&quot;).  As an entertainment, you will get more than your money's worth, and along the way, you may learn a thing or two about yourself and your world.  I have seen this show about a dozen times and learn something new each time.

It's about famous fairy tale characters being attached to each other in the most strangest ways you could ever imagine.From Cinderella to Jack in the Bean Stock you get to see some of your favorite characters interact with each other. Bernadette Peters is beyond excellent as Repunzele's witch. The two Prince's are very funny ( especially towards the end. )There are also so many great one liners that will want to make you watch it over and over.Every one's performance in this movie is professional and entertaining.I especially loved during close towards the end of the second first act. Were Petes' turns from a horrible nasty looking witch, to her true very beautiful forum.Also who are very funny are Cinderella's step sisters and her step mother. One of my favorite line is when their all facing the giant and Peter's is all like ""Excuse me... Would you like a blind girl instead?""(Replying to the stepsisters who are now blind. Because pigeons poked out their eyes on Cinderella's wedding day.) The Stepmother says , ""How dare you!""It's moments like those that will make you to continue watching it.Why even Jack's mother has some very funny and clever moments. For instant when she first meats the Prince and she 's screaming about the giant. Or when the Baker's wife tells her that she has no children and she then says, "" That's ok to.""There are so many other wonderful actors and actresses in the movie.In fact a couple of the actors even play two parts, and I think that is very impressive. The costumes are also very beautiful like Cinderella's dress.

His use in the opening number of the word ""wither"" three times in succession, each with different meanings is something that no other writer of musical theater would be able to pull off ""...while her withers wither with her....and no one keeps a cow for a friend.""The cast is almost perfect.  Bernadette Peters as the witch is wonderful casting, though it is almost a shame that Joanna Gleason as the Baker's Wife out-shines her.  Little Red Riding Hood is a hoot, in a macabre and cynical way.  Jack (of Jack and the Beanstalk fame) is wonderfully scatterbrained.  Cinderella as a girl who isn't quite sure what she wants is wonderfully treated, as is Prince(s) Charming as men who always want the girl the can't have.  My only compliant with the castin would be Chip Zein as the Baker, who doesn't seem to quite know how to treat his character.

431657,A3NKRH3TJ4DPVI,6304681372,Book Glutton,"[1, 1]","I first saw this in a live production, put on by a talented local company. It was my first glimpse at Stephen Sondheim's work. I was fascinated at the genius that permitted him to take these fairy tale characters, so well-known to us, and place them collectively into a new plot, which did not have such a fairy-tale nature to it.My take is that he has taken them out of their world and placed them into our world with a human nature just like ours, capable of good and evil. It brings out a dark side of the characters that we have not witnessed before in them. A twist of that genius is that Sondheim has us looking at, and reflecting on, ourselves and our own capacity for betrayal, deceit, duplicity, and the like.With ambition and competitive personalities like we witness in our world, this weaves a new aspect into the common ""happily ever after"" theme. The two acts give us a before and ""striving"" look, and then an ""after"" look at how this remanufactured ""living happily ever after"" theme resultantly appears.The play has a puzzle-like quality to it. It is fast-moving with more that a few subtleties necessary to piece this puzzle together. The screenplay is a portrayal of mixed emotions, which it easily evokes from its audience. There is laughter and sadness--seriousness and diversions--satire and wit, mixed with a powerful and entertaining score of music from beginning to end--which too is part of the puzzle!I bought this on DVD so that I could continue what I failed to complete at the theatre. I watched it twice so far. It was all the more delightful on the screen with the wonderful close-ups of the characters and a much better sound quality.

Abused by her stepmother and stepsisters she is pretty miserable until she marries a prince only to find that he is having an affair.Jack and mother: Jack must sell his best friend, a cow, makes friends with a giantess and proceeds to steal three times from her and kill her husband. When the giantess comes for revenge he kills her also. In the meantime his mother is killed by the steward to the king.Baker and wife: After sometimes stealing and sometimes not they gather ingredients for a potion so they can have children. The baker, while looking for Jack in the woods, doesn't know that his wife is having an affair at the moment with Cinderella's husband. She dies almost right afterwards leaving behind their baby boy.Little Red Riding Hood: After killing a wolf with her grandmother she gives her red coat away and in the chaos that ensues both her mother and grandmother die leaving her no one.Rapunzel: When she finally makes it out of the tower she has been living in most of her life she has her hair cut off, bears 2 children and finds her blinded lover. After they get married it is not a happily ever after, her husband has an affair with Snow White and she has crazy fits.The Witch: Although she abused Rapunzel mightily as a child she was trying to do her best. She was punished for someone taking beans out of her garden and turned ugly. Although the spell is eventually reversed she loses her power. She ends up fed up and dies (I think) by falling into the earth.Snow White and Sleeping Beauty: Most likely have unknown affairs with the two princes, thinking they are unmarried but this is not for certain.What story is this? None other than Into the Woods, a musical.

Capturing it on film loses a little something, since you're restricted to watching where the camera brings you, and you can't enjoy the surrounding atmosphere. I say this as an explanation of why I gave Into the Woods only 4 stars. If I were able to watch it as intended, it would easily be 5 stars, but there is something that I feel is lost in translation.That said, Into the Woods is an excellent musical by the legendary Steven Sondheim. It takes a mixture of fairy tales, including Rapunzel, Little Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk, and Cinderella, and puts them all into a blender. The result is a play that has a very quirky first act, and a surprisingly dark second half. The music is excellent, and the songs are at times laugh out loud funny -- especially when it comes to the pair of womanizing Prince Charmings.Bernadette Peters steals the show with her amazing acting as the evil witch. However, all the performances in this production are spot-on, and the script, music, and timing are perfect. If you're familiar with the fairy tales involved, you already know the plot -- or at least the first half of it. You'll be surprised and delighted to see where the rest of the story leads.

As a result, the audience doesn't always warm up to the collaborations in which Sondheim finds interesting. To have the foresight to hire Terry Hughes to place four cameras on the stage of the Martin Beck Theatre to capture ""Into The Woods"" for it's premier production was nothing short of brilliance. Thirty years from now, this will be a treasure: Johanna Gleason, Bernadette Peters, Kim Crosby, Chip Zien. One never forgets that we are watching a live performance, yet the cameras do the work of a director who is a genius-only a television director could pull this off.

Into the Woods, a Stephen Sondheim musical, was one of her great triumphs.  This musical is an allegory on the numerous themes we see in fairy tales; it also combines several well-known tales into a cohesive whole (Jack and the Beanstalk, Rapunzel, Cinderella, etc.).  As a musical, there are a lot of songs, most very cleverly written and some of them even hummable for the general audience.  The musical has a lot of amusing moments and is quite enjoyable in all.The overall plotline is a little complex, but basically, it follows the general storyline of the above fairy tales to their conclusion, as accompanied by the smart Sondheim songs (he also wrote for West Side Story, Gypsy, and Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, in case you didn't know).  However, that is only the first half of the play.  The first half has more tunes and is more amusing.  The second half, however, shows the consequences of what has transpired from the completed fairy tales.  In a sense, it continues the storyline before the EVER AFTER (which is one of the names of the songs, by the way).  The second half, then, is the more serious of the two.  In fact, it's rather a bit of a downer after such a fun first half.  Nonetheless, it still has a few memorable tunes, such as No One is Alone.Bernadette Peters has a role as a witch in the musical.  Also of note is Joanna Gleason, who won a best actress Tony Award for her amusing role as the baker's wife.  Everyone sings well, especially these two actresses.  The musical also garnered two more Tonys  for best score and best book.Just a few words on the DVD, which I bought.  This is essentially the broadcast version of the live musical, as shown several years back on PBS.  The picture quality is decent, and the PCM (not dolby digital) sound quality is okay, too, considering this was from a TV broadcast.  There are no extras at all on the DVD, unfortunately, although the musical does run for over 2 and  hours, and there are a generous number of bookmarks so you can easily access your favorite song.  Bottom line - this is a very good Broadway musical and certainly worth viewing.  The DVD transfer is acceptable, though a few extras, like cast notes or maybe even subtitles for sing-alongs would have been appreciated.

The fairytale element added a level of appeal to it, and an amazing cast help to boost it to a stellar performance.The prologue was fantastic. The only gripe I have is that the tiered structure of Jack, Cinderella, the Baker, and his wife makes it a little overwhelming and sends the mind into overdrive. Still, once you get a hang of the musical, a second-time screening makes the prologue more enjoyable. Most of the songs are catchy, and range from comedic (Agony) to tear-jerking (Stay with Me, Lament). There is a great balance of humour, and adventure, and best of all, I love how the characters walk on stage and quote a moral from their individual stories. I was a little disappointed at how the words for Agony was not as clear as it was in the cast recording CD. Westernberg and Wagner seemed a little rushed, and at times cut each other off.Bernadette Peters put in a remarkable performance as The Witch. She moved me to tears in Stay With Me, and had me in stitches in the Prologue. When she transformed into the beautiful witch, she clearly portrayed the new air of grace came with it. Joanna Gleason played the Baker's wife to perfection. Her strong vocals and marvellous expressive skills portrays the Baker's wife to be as real as any of us - strong at times, weak at others. Danielle Ferland was outstanding as Little Red Riding Hood, adding a tinge of sarcasm to her character. Ben Wright (Jack), seemed a little wooden, but his great vocals shone in Giants In The Sky. I personally thought Kim Crosby was excellent as Cinderella although many seemed to be disappointed with her performance. She did seemed a little off on the DVD but she had a lovely voice in the cast CD. Robert Westernberg and Chuck Wagner were rightly cast.I couldn't have asked for a better cast for this musical. It is by far, one of the best musicals I have ever seen, and I must admit that I was blown away.Get this. You won't regret it.Note: To those who find it shocking that the Stepsisters cut off their heel and toe to fit into the golden slipper, that is the original version by the Grimm brothers.

Here is a different take on some of our most beloved fairy tales as the heros collide in one story.A childless couple, a baker and his wife, long to be parents, but a witch, who happens to be their neighbor, placed a curse on the baker's family. They are to remain childless unless they can bring the witch several magical items - a milk white cow, a red cape, golden slippers and for extra good measure some magic beans. That shouldn't be such a hard task in the land of fairy tales.Several fairy tales mesh into one as Little Red Riding Hood goes to grandma's house but stops at the bakery first. Cinderella is dreaming of the royal ball. Jack's mother wants him to sell the family's milky white cow, who happens to be his best friend. The baker and his wife set off to find the items that will lift the curse just as Jack learns the magic beans really are magic and our Jack wreaks havoc as he steals from the giant.The music and the scenery are an explosion of color and life. INTO THE WOODS was an award-winning Broadway musical with a score written by the great Stephen Sondheim. Fortunately, a performance by the original cast was filmed for all of us to enjoy. This is an actual stage performance in front of a theater audience. You can't to feel the audience's presence with their applause and laughter. This is also a high quality film production. Several cameras were used so it is almost like they were filming a movie. A true work of art was preserved for all time.The cast is truly remarkable. Lovely Bernadette Peters stars as the evil witch who has had an ugly curse put on her. Danielle Ferland is a cute but street-wise Red Riding Hood. Joanna Gleason is another standout as the baker's wife. The cast is just wonderful from the two not so also charming princes to Jack's long-suffering mother. Lots of love and inspiration was added to this production and it is an absolute delight.",5,ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTFUL FAIRY TALE MUSICAL ADVENTURE,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,2120,"['Wow', 'WOODS', 'winner', 'levels', 'What', 'fun', 'wonderful', 'romp', 'land', 'fairy', 'tale', 'favorites', 'Creative', 'enjoyable', 'total', 'breath', 'freshness', 'INTO', 'THE', 'WOODS', 'delight', 'levels', 'Here', 'different', 'take', 'most', 'beloved', 'fairy', 'tales', 'heros', 'collide', 'one', 'story.A', 'childless', 'couple', 'baker', 'wife', 'long', 'be', 'parents', 'witch', 'who', 'be', 'neighbor', 'placed', 'curse', 'baker', 'family', 'are', 'remain', 'childless', 'can', 'bring', 'witch', 'several', 'magical', 'items', 'milk', 'white', 'cow', 'red', 'cape', 'golden', 'slippers', 'extra', 'good', 'measure', 'magic', 'beans', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'such', 'hard', 'task', 'land', 'fairy', 'tales.Several', 'fairy', 'tales', 'mesh', 'one', 'Little', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'grandma', 'house', 'bakery', 'first', 'Cinderella', 'dreaming', 'royal', 'ball', 'Jack', 'mother', 'sell', 'family', 'milky', 'white', 'cow', 'who', 'be', 'best', 'friend', 'baker', 'wife', 'set', 'off', 'find', 'items', 'will', 'lift', 'curse', 'just', 'Jack', 'magic', 'beans', 'really', 'are', 'magic', 'Jack', 'wreaks', 'havoc', 'giant.The', 'music', 'scenery', 'are', 'explosion', 'color', 'life', 'INTO', 'THE', 'WOODS', 'was', 'award-winning', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'score', 'written', 'great', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'Fortunately', 'performance', 'original', 'cast', 'was', 'filmed', 'enjoy', 'actual', 'stage', 'performance', 'front', 'theater', 'audience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'feel', 'audience', 'presence', 'applause', 'laughter', 'also', 'high', 'quality', 'film', 'production', 'Several', 'cameras', 'were', 'used', 'almost', 'were', 'filming', 'movie', 'true', 'work', 'art', 'was', 'preserved', 'time.The', 'cast', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'Lovely', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'evil', 'witch', 'who', 'had', 'ugly', 'curse', 'put', 'Danielle', 'Ferland', 'cute', 'street-wise', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'Joanna', 'Gleason', 'standout', 'baker', 'wife', 'cast', 'just', 'wonderful', 'two', 'not', 'so', 'also', 'charming', 'princes', 'Jack', 'long-suffering', 'mother', 'Lots', 'love', 'inspiration', 'was', 'added', 'production', 'absolute', 'delight']",Into the Woods VHS

431691,A3SLA4ADDSYZJ2,6304681372,Josh Hitchens,"[36, 45]","This is a glorious musical. The first act takes traditional fairy tale characters on a happy quest journey, and a much more serious journey in the second. The Baker and his Wife need to get four things to lift the curse of  sterility that the Witch, played fabulously by Bernadette Peters, has  bestowed on them. She tells the story of the curse in a rap like song. In  doing this they meet a spunky Little Red Riding Hood, who is being pursued  by the Big Bad Wolf, Jack (of Beanstalk fame), Rapunzel, and Cinderella.  Humor and tears highlight this musical by Sondheim. The song,  &quot;Children Will Listen,&quot; spreads the message of the play, which is  that everyone must be careful and learn and face up to life's tragedies.  Here is a snippet of it:Careful the wish you make, wishes are children.  Careful the path they take, wishes come true. Not free. No one is  alone.Filled with humor and magic, INTO THE WOODS is told by The  Narrator, who gets fed to the Giant's wife in the second act. The Witch's  love for Rapunzel is illustrated in the song, STAY WITH ME:Outside the  world is warped and wild. Stay a child while you can be a child.Lines  like, &quot;I need that shoe to have a child!&quot; And Little Red Riding  Hood's cynicism , &quot;You talk to birds?&quot; make this a priceless  treasure.",5,Wonderous!,946512000,"12 30, 1999",1999,1314,"['glorious', 'musical', 'first', 'act', 'traditional', 'fairy', 'tale', 'characters', 'happy', 'quest', 'journey', 'much', 'more', 'serious', 'journey', 'second', 'Baker', 'Wife', 'need', 'get', 'four', 'things', 'lift', 'curse', 'sterility', 'Witch', 'played', 'fabulously', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'bestowed', 'story', 'curse', 'rap', 'song', 'doing', 'meet', 'spunky', 'Little', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'who', 'being', 'pursued', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Wolf', 'Jack', 'Beanstalk', 'fame', 'Rapunzel', 'Cinderella', 'Humor', 'tears', 'highlight', 'musical', 'Sondheim', 'song', 'quot', 'Children', 'Will', 'Listen', 'quot', 'message', 'play', 'everyone', 'must', 'be', 'careful', 'learn', 'face', 'up', 'life', 'tragedies', 'Here', 'snippet', 'Careful', 'wish', 'make', 'wishes', 'are', 'children', 'Careful', 'path', 'take', 'come', 'true', 'Not', 'free', 'one', 'alone.Filled', 'humor', 'magic', 'INTO', 'THE', 'WOODS', 'told', 'Narrator', 'who', 'fed', 'Giant', 'wife', 'second', 'act', 'Witch', 'love', 'Rapunzel', 'illustrated', 'song', 'STAY', 'WITH', 'ME', 'world', 'warped', 'wild', 'Stay', 'child', 'can', 'be', 'child.Lines', 'quot', 'need', 'shoe', 'have', 'child', 'quot', 'Little', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'cynicism', 'quot', 'talk', 'birds', 'quot', 'make', 'priceless', 'treasure']",Into the Woods VHS

The first half was pretty boring for me and it was so long I thought the finale for act one was the end.  The second half drew my attention in a negative way.  I really didn't like the way things ended up.  The giant killing so many people really didn't seem necessary to me to prove the point of this musical.  The way people were killed almost out of comedy drove me in sane death is never a light moment.What drove me crazy even more was how the baker's wife died.  I hate in when main characters die, but at least in some musicals its a very touching death, but here you don't really feel bad after her affair with the prince and this takes away from her husband and the audiance feeling for her.  I guess what I mean is it would have been ever more moving if she died with out the affair, and her husband said and did all that stuff after she passed away.I also hate the fact of recreating fairytales and making the characters look bad.  Why do we always have to poke fun about these tales?  It almost seems like they arn't respected at all at times.  Musicals like Once Upon a Mattress and Cinderella were cleaver and wonderful because they stuck to the characteristics of the main characters.  I think sometimes people take to many liberties with character and it ends up like Into the Woods.  All the characters were made weird and unlovable by the time the final curtain in the second act fell. (with maybe the exception of Cinderella).On a more positive note there was some amazing songs and amazing actresses and actors singing them.  ""no One is Alone"" is my favorite and it is beautiful.  Some of the songs seem really repetative however.  The set seemed really cheesy as well, and the fake animals and fake giant just added to the disaster.",2,It wasn't the worst thing I've seen...,1109376000,"02 26, 2005",2005,1830,"['musical', 'very', 'interesting', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'describe', 'first', 'half', 'was', 'pretty', 'boring', 'was', 'so', 'long', 'thought', 'finale', 'act', 'one', 'was', 'end', 'second', 'half', 'drew', 'attention', 'negative', 'way', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'way', 'things', 'ended', 'up', 'giant', 'killing', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'necessary', 'prove', 'point', 'musical', 'way', 'people', 'were', 'killed', 'almost', 'comedy', 'sane', 'death', 'never', 'light', 'drove', 'crazy', 'even', 'more', 'was', 'how', 'baker', 'wife', 'died', 'hate', 'when', 'main', 'characters', 'die', 'least', 'musicals', 'very', 'touching', 'death', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'bad', 'affair', 'prince', 'away', 'husband', 'audiance', 'feeling', 'guess', 'what', 'mean', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'ever', 'more', 'moving', 'died', 'out', 'affair', 'husband', 'said', 'did', 'stuff', 'passed', 'away.I', 'also', 'hate', 'fact', 'recreating', 'fairytales', 'making', 'characters', 'look', 'bad', 'Why', 'do', 'always', 'have', 'poke', 'fun', 'tales', 'almost', 'ar', ""n't"", 'respected', 'times', 'Musicals', 'Once', 'Mattress', 'Cinderella', 'were', 'cleaver', 'wonderful', 'stuck', 'characteristics', 'main', 'characters', 'think', 'sometimes', 'people', 'take', 'many', 'liberties', 'character', 'up', 'Into', 'Woods', 'characters', 'were', 'made', 'weird', 'unlovable', 'time', 'final', 'curtain', 'second', 'act', 'fell', 'maybe', 'exception', 'Cinderella', '.On', 'more', 'positive', 'note', 'was', 'amazing', 'songs', 'amazing', 'actresses', 'actors', 'singing', 'One', 'Alone', 'favorite', 'beautiful', 'songs', 'seem', 'really', 'repetative', 'however', 'set', 'seemed', 'really', 'cheesy', 'as', 'well', 'fake', 'animals', 'fake', 'giant', 'just', 'added', 'disaster']",Into the Woods VHS

431701,A1BKMYEQ6BP5B5,6304681372,"Maria Beadnell ""gotlips""","[4, 11]","There's a lot right with this musical, and with this particular production. Weaving all the stories together (Jack and the Beanstalk, Cinderella, Rapunzel) and introducing proletariet characters in the Baker and his Wife, catchy music.  For Sondheim, catchy is rare. Beautiful is to be expected, but not catchy.The story has a great start: get all the couples together in the first act and then examine: What would living in a tower for her whole life do to Rapunzel? Isn't a prince who likes to kiss comatose women just a little, you know, disturbing?As a historian, I would welcome a chance to sit down with Lapine and take him to task for the obvious fiction: he said he went to the ""original"" tales to make this story. No. He didn't. There is no original tale. These are folk traditions and no one knows who wrote what. On top of which, they did not grow ""corn"" in medieval Europe--a key plot point-- and the Baker of that time did not run a little shop. That's not what they meant by Baker; they mostly meant the person to whom you brought your food for baking because so few had ovens. I would not mind the anachronisms if they hadn't made such a big deal about going to ""original"" sources, but, whatever gets you publicity, I guess.The cast is uniformly marvelous. Every character has something to like. It was only on the third viewing that I realized how much of that has to do with the wonderful acting. If you just pay attention to the words, the Baker's Wife is really not a nice person. She is a liar and a cheat and terribly, selfishly immature.  But Joanna Gleason is so warm and her acting so good that she gives the impression of a complex, conflicted character. And Chip Zien as the Baker is good in every way.Kim Crosby as Cinderella also acts better than the material and sings like an angel. the only weak singing is the Narrator, but he is not meant to sing well.

431702,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,6304681372,Mark Baker,"[18, 19]","This musical takes several fairy tales and combines them for a fresh, fun journey.  A baker and his wife have learned that they are under a curse and can't have any children.  To lift the curse, they must find the cape as red as blood, the cow as white as milk, the hair as yellow as gold, and the slipper as pure as glass.  Fortunately for them, they are going into the same woods that Jack, Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, and Rapunzel are entering.The second act picks up &quot;Later.&quot;  Things don't quite work out as well as everyone expected them to, and they once again find themselves entering the woods to deal with their new challenges.The first act is a perfect musical comedy with some wonderful moments, but the second act is much darker in tone.  While it still has it's funny moments, it is much more serious.  But the dramatic turn works well, and what started out as a fun romp turns into a powerful story.  Still, because of this, I have a hard time recommending it for children.The cast does a wonderful job.  It's really hard to pick out a highlight because everyone works well together to make it so good.  The format, video recording of a live stage performance by the original Broadway cast, took me a little time to get used to when I first watched it, but soon I forgot all about that.  The camera captures everything on stage; can't imagine a better seat in the house.The DVD is just a bare bones version; there's nothing outside of the musical.  But it's still worth getting since you will want to watch it many times.Teens and adults will love this musical's sense of humor and be moved by its emotion.  It provides all the joys of a stage play in the comfort of your own home.  Buy it today and get ready to journey &quot;Into the Woods.&quot;",5,Once Upon a Time.

It very smartly weaves together all those fairy tales so  familiar to us all.  Then act two makes us look at them through adult eyes.  I think Sondheim and Lapine are telling us that in fairy tales as well as  &quot;real&quot; life, the simple words &quot;I wish...&quot; are truly the  beginning of whatever story each of us is about to tell.  They counsel us  to be careful of what we wish in life -- our wishes effect everyone.My  favorite song in this production is &quot;The Last Midnight&quot; which is  performed by Bernadette Peters as the Witch.

431714,A1VR77XNWXHGQ9,6304681372,qmechanic,"[0, 1]","About six weeks ago, I watched this DVD of Stephen Sondheim's ""Into the Woods."" It happened to be on my Netflix queue because I was curious about Sondheim's work. What a delightful surprise to discover this piece of work (which is not even considered Sondheim's best.)The story melds several traditional fairy tales (Little Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk, Cinderella) into one with the addition of three new characters: the Baker, the Baker's wife, and the witch. One aspect I really enjoyed was the ensemble nature of the work. No one character dominates and pretty much every major player has at least one great song. The casting was terrific; everyone acted superbly (the standout being Joanna Gleason as the Baker's wife). I also really liked the fact that each character had a unique voice (not chosen just to be beautiful and melodic, but to fit the character). The book by James Lapine was also very funny and witty, matching Sondheim's clever lyrics.None of the songs are really show-stopping with the exception of ""Giants in the Sky"" and ""Children Will Listen"" in the Act II finale. But that's fine because ""Into the Woods"" is an ensemble work and you really have to watch the whole thing to appreciate it. Unlike the other musicals I've seen (Les Miserables, Phantom of the Opera, etc), the acting was more important than the singing. Not that the singing was bad, but I really enjoyed the fact that the actors and actresses put so much effort into being the characters. The most amazing song is Joanna Gleason's performance of ""Moments in the Woods."" It was wonderful to see her express different moods with slight movements of her head and facial expressions and even do little things like fix up her hair while singing.What I really like about the songs in Into the Woods is that they're tied to a character's thinking and slightly ambiguous. Little Red wonders whether she did the right thing ""straying off the path."" Cinderella debates whether she should tell the Prince who she really is. Perhaps that is why some people find Sondheim unusually cerebral for a songwriter. The ambiguous nature of ""Into the Woods"" is fitting since the woods are a metaphor for our journey through life.Bernadette Peters is the main attraction and she does a wonderful job with the witch, but I find the character of the witch to be a little shallow compared to the Baker and the Baker's wife. As an example, I really loved the song ""It Takes Two"" where the Baker and Baker's wife sing about how they need each other.To sum up, ""Into the Woods"" was a wonderful introduction to Sondheim's work and I look forward to more!Additional note: I just read a Sondheim interview where Sondheim summarized ""Into the Woods"" as a Bronx couple (the Baker and his wife) living in a world of fairytale characters.

Even given that this was a filming of a stage production, the camera work is brilliant -- look at the staging in ""Last Midnight"" to see how well it works.And the book, lyrics, staging, scoring and casting all are flawless. Bernadette Peters is spectacular, if I can single out some of her brilliant moments, look for her transformation in seconds from Old Witch to Young Witch, and her comic pantomime of eating a bug -- to be seen to be believed, and laughed at.Among the new cast members, Joanna Gleason as the Baker's Wife and Chip Zien as the Baker are fine, as others have pointed out, as is Ben Wright as Jack. Tom Aldredge as the Narrator and Mysterious Man, and Robert Westenberg as the Wolf and Cinderella's Prince (he was in Sunday in the Park, BTW), pull off brilliant and droll performances in dual roles.

431719,A22MZBJWTC5WF,6304681372,"RVR ""Theater Geek""","[3, 3]","The first time I heard anything from this show was when someone in acting class sang ""Children Will Listen"" as part of a class performance project.  Since the rendition was not exactly stirring, I wrote it off.  Then I got this video for my birthday.  I proceeded to kick myself repeatedly for not having seen it sooner.The show begins with a retelling of the macabre fairy tales we all know so well (Cinderella, Jack & the Beanstalk, et al.).  It then proceeds to dismantle all of our preconcieved notions about them.  We begin to realize that the characters in the stories never had to deal with the consequences of thier actions (and let's face it, some of their actions are horrific).The beauty of the show is in the new and different portrayal of familiar characters. We see the dysfunctional princes whose need for adventure far outweighs the love they have for their spouses once the damsels are out of distress.  We meet a ""wicked"" witch who, in trying to protect her child from the evils fo the world, ends up destroying her.  We see that each of the characters are so driven by their own agenda that they never stop to think the effect they have on others.The performances here are beautifully executed with particular kudos for Joanna Gleason and Bernadette Peters for creating heart-breaking, hilarious characters.  This is what musical theater acting is meant to be.I have heard many critics say that this show should end at Act 1.  Once again, Sondheim gets accused of being cerebral.  Those of you reading this who have not seen the show: do NOT see a Sondheim show if you want to see mindless entertainment.  If you like cutesy musicals, you will not like this or any other show written by this composer...I guarantee it. See this if you want to be entertained and you don't mind using your brain in the process.

431720,AVN00ASBFTMN6,6304681372,Smoking Ace,"[0, 0]","More than twenty years after its a original run, Into the Woods remains one of Stephen Sondheim's most enduring works along with Sweeney Todd and Company. And after viewing this DVD for the first time, its not difficult to realize why. Everything you could ask for in theatrical entertainment is here: A beautiful score from Sondheim, mystical set designs, great performances, and most importantly a Recording that is very well edited.At the start of Act 1 the plot is set in motion when a Baker (Chip Zein) and his wife (Joanna Gleason) are visited by their most hideous neighbor witch (Peters) and told they must retrieve 4 items from a nearby forest or their family tree will remain ""a barren one"". Here we are given the four connecting fairy tales (Jack and the Bean Stalk, Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, and Rapunzel) that will give these characters unexpected consequences in Act 2 . Of the 2 acts this is the more light hearted, letting us in with laughs and new revisions of stories we all enjoyed as children. The 1st Act is sensational for its comedic moments. One scene that always gets my gut busting is Bernadette Peters trying aimlessly to climb Rapunzel's hair as the tower revolves off stage. Danielle Ferland makes for one of the funniest Red riding hoods I've ever seen, looking innocent under her big floppy curls but proving the assumption wrong when she later sports a knife and  wolf shaw she skinned herself. Many reviewers have stated that Ben Wright is wooden as Jack, but in a strange way it sort of adds to the character's naive charm.As many others have stated, The 2nd Act is of a much darker nature, but I believe it is for a reason. One of the main themes running throughout the show is the passage of growing up. Just consider the experiences most people have with these fairy tales, when young they seem sweet and alive, but as we get older we realize the reality that is not present in them. Into the woods gives us these grown up realites: Loveable characters die, Cinderellas are cheated on,witches are indeed sometimes right, and that there is a time when we have to stop being children and face reality head on. But don't get me wrong this section still has its light hearted moments, ""I was only trying to be a good mother!"", and if anything this act is much stronger emotionally than the first. Working in (IMO) three of the best scenes in the whole play: Peters' final hoorah  in ""The Last Midnight"", Gleason's charm striking ""Moments in the woods"", and the tearjerking comfort of the finale ""No One is Alone/Children will listen"".Like most theatrical productions, the performances are the heart and soul of Into the Woods. The acting ranges from good to just out of this world excellent. Most other reviewers have already lavished much deserved  praise upon Bernadette's witch, but I'm going to chime in anyway. If you didn't know of or particulary like Bernadette Peters before Into the Woods you will be guaranteed to feel differently afterwards. She is both hilarious, empathetic, and yes spellbinding, in this performance. There is not a moment on stage where she doesn't assert herself as a star. From her 1st appearance in the prologue (Proof that Sondheim is often merciless when it comes to writing singing parts) to the sad pining of ""Stay with me"". If there is one reason for you to buy this dvd: it's her. But that isn't the only reason, Into the Woods is a play sparkling with scene stealers. Joanna Gleason is heartwarming and witty as the Baker's wife, creating magical chemistry with the neurotic but also good Chip Zein. Robert Westenburg and Chuck Wagner are both laughing stocks as the two chauvenistic princes who enjoy the ""hunt"" more then the prize itself, I don't think it was unintentional that Westenburg also played the wolf. Another performance that I found quite good, and overlooked, was Barbra Byrne as Jack's Mother: There is a woman with good comic timing.Looking back on Into the Woods, I find it haunting in a very sentimental way. The depth of the characters and the poignancy of the script, make it to where we never want to leave these characters. The other night, after I had returned Into the woods to Netflix, I sat on the sofa doing my homework bored out of my mind and frustrated. When for some reason Joanna Gleason's revision of ""No one is alone"" popped into my head. Cracking a smile and nearly wiping a small tear from my eye, I just sat there above my A&P; books and thought ""Wow,How great and moving a musical that was."" And then I went to Amazon, bought it, and am now offering all people who want a moving experience like this to immediately buy Into the Woods.Musical Highlights: ""Giants in the Sky"" ""Agony"" ""The Last Midnight"" ""No one is Alone"" ""Children will Listen""",5,"Powerful, funny, and moving---Into The Woods is a treasure to own",1314576000,"08 29, 2011",2011,4765,"['More', 'twenty', 'years',

431721,A3NCGS8APMCP0D,6304681372,"Sondhead ""Dennis""","[2, 2]","After watching the life out of the Sweeney Todd DVD, [With George Hearn]I wanted to see another Sondheim musical so I spent 30 bucks and bought this. IT IS AMAZING! The set, the backround, the cast...everything is just awesome! We have the very talented origial cast but the main thing to buy this has to be because BERNEDETTE PETERS STARS IN IT! The role was WRITTEN for her! It is just great especially the Midnight songs. The first act and the begining of the second act are hilarious but then, towards the end,it's gets darker. Most of cast dies at then end. But the moral of this story [That's in the second act] is that no one has a happy ending. Miserable things happen [Especially if you are bad] in life and no one gets a perfect life. People you love die, things around you go away, it may seem scart but that's life. It also goes to show that the evil never win. The evil ALWAYS loose and they are ALWAYS punished, even if they are free for a little while, they will always get punished. Take the Whitch in this story for example. She was evil. She was punished and died at the end. In today's world you can see the same thing happen to people like Saddam Husain. He was free to do evil things for a long time, but soon, he was caught and punished and now he has to spend the rest of his life in jail. So even if the things I've just listed seem scary and don't seem right for children, I'd think your wrong because this is a great family movie. It might be best for a little more mature kids [Kids that can take an unhappy ending and are not scared of witches and that kind of stuff] but I reccomend the first act for any child of any age. But the meaning of the story is in the second act.The story is fabulous, the set and props are too cool and the actors are AWESOME! I reccomend this totally and I also reccomend Sweeney Todd.

I DID see the play in high school too. Weird. But the video came first, so...end of aside) and have loved it ever since. I am an optimistic person by nature and like the phrase &quot;happily ever after.&quot; I don't understand why our cyncial society is so determined to sink that phrase in the cruel, unforgiving sea of reality (for more on this subject see Cervantes' soliloquoy in &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;). It is, however, always a great relief to me when I see that &quot;Non-happy ever after&quot; type shows generally always prove themselves wrong. The ending to this musical is...not what you'd expect! Ha! Thought I was gonna spoil it, didn't ya? But just the same it is  a happy one. If any ending can be called happy in the wake of horror and death, and I say sure. Sondheim's best work, in my book.

431723,AP9RVNCXHB3OB,6304681372,Thayer,"[3, 3]","This is one of the few Broadway shows that is available on DVD. I'm glad that it's a live recording of the show instead of the taped versions like in Cats, it's so much better with the audience reactions and cheers.Bernadette Peters was phenomenal. People may have doubts with her singing abilities, but we can say with certainty that as a performer she's undoubtedly if not the best one of the best. She has such a presence that just grabs you completely and she has a great comedic timing She is perfection. Another stand out is Joanna Gleason who won a Tony for her role. She has such a great timing. She never missed a beat, all her lines were spot on.The songs were all wonderful and probably the most hummable collection of songs by Stephen Sondheim. But his trademark profound and meaningful lyrics are still there. Children will Listen is a great song that has a very observant lyrics. Agony was just plain hilarious. And the titular song, Into the Woods, is catchy and a great opener.The Act1 is funnier and lighter. Bernadette Peters's entrance as the Witch was memorable. I love how the show mocked itself (""You talk to birds...?"" ""Rapunzel, what kind of name is that?""). Really funny script. The Act 2 tells what happens after the usual happily ever after and it's darker in tone, but it's still witty and funny and charming.Grade:A",5,Into the Woods,1116979200,"05 25, 2005",2005,1344,"['one', 'few', 'Broadway', 'shows', 'available', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'glad', 'live', 'recording', 'show', 'instead', 'taped', 'versions', 'Cats', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'audience', 'reactions', 'cheers.Bernadette', 'Peters', 'was', 'phenomenal', 'People', 'may', 'have', 'doubts', 'singing', 'abilities', 'can', 'say', 'certainty', 'performer', 'undoubtedly', 'not', 'best', 'one', 'best', 'presence', 'just', 'grabs', 'completely', 'great', 'comedic', 'timing', 'perfection', 'stand', 'out', 'Joanna', 'Gleason', 'who', 'won', 'Tony', 'role', 'such', 'great', 'timing', 'never', 'missed', 'beat', 'lines', 'were', 'spot', 'on.The', 'songs', 'were', 'wonderful', 'probably', 'most', 'hummable', 'collection', 'songs', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'trademark', 'profound', 'meaningful', 'lyrics', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'Children', 'will', 'Listen', 'great', 'song', 'very', 'observant', 'lyrics', 'Agony', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'hilarious', 'titular', 'song', 'Into', 'Woods', 'catchy', 'great', 'opener.The', 'Act1', 'funnier', 'lighter', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'entrance', 'Witch', 'was', 'memorable', 'love', 'how', 'show', 'mocked', 'talk', 'birds', 'Rapunzel', 'what', 'kind', 'name', 'Really', 'funny', 'script', 'Act', '2', 'tells', 'what', 'usual', 'happily', 'ever', 'darker', 'tone', 'still', 'witty', 'funny', 'charming.Grade']",Into the Woods VHS
431724,A2FQAOD1W3O4GE,6304681372,Theatre Fanatic,"[4, 4]","&quot;Into the Woods&quot;, though not his masterpiece (that title belongs to &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;), is proabably the great Stephen Sondheim's most poular and oft-performed show. This tremendous original cast brings the magical songs of Sondheim and the ground-breaking book of Jame Lapine's together to make for a magical Broadway experience.When &quot;Into the Woods&quot; first opened on Broadway in 1987, it was greeted with great anticipation. After all, this was to be the newest Sondheim show... and it was starring Bernadette Peters. The show became an instant classic as audiences loved the show.The plot revolves around the Baker and his Wife, who want to have  a child, but due to a witches's curse, cannot. They have to find &quot;a cow as white as milk, a cape as red as blood, hair as yellow as corn and a slipper as pure as gold&quot; in order to reerse the curse. On the way, they encounter many characters from well-known tales, like Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Jack the Giant Killer and Rapunzel. However, the second act involves many dark and twisted twists, as we journey onto what happenes after &quot;happily ever after&quot;. The plot becomes much less joyous as in the second act...MUCH less happy. The show is magnificent on the outside, with its' intricate yet followable plot and Sondheim's masterful songs. One of the most interesting things about this musical, however, is the metaphor that extends throughout. (I'll let you figure it out yourself).The score includes oft-recorded songs such as &quot;Children Will Listen&quot; and &quot;No One is Alone&quot;. ALL of the songs are great though. From the mournful &quot;No More&quot; to hysterical &quot;Agony&quot; you will savor every moment.The cast, including Chip Zein, Joanna Gleason and Bernadette Peters, are inmaculate. Their interpretations are dead on, with beutiful renditions of every song. Especially Gleason and Peters.The show won the 1988 Tony's for BEST SCORE, BEST BOOK and BEST ACTRESS (Joanna Gleason who was incredible as the Baker's wife).Buy this magnificent Sondheim show and dive into the world of Sondheim.*****Two Notes:  1) If you would like a more complete sample of Stephen Sondheim, buy the &quot;Stephen Sondheim Collection&quot; on Amazon.com. It includes 6 DVD's: &quot;Into the Woods&quot;, &quot;Passion&quot;, &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot;,  Concert of &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;, Concert of &quot;Follies&quot; (both of these concerts are incredible), and the once-in-a-lifetime event &quot;Sondheim: A Celebration at Carnegie Hall&quot;.2) If you buy the cast recording for &quot;into the Woods&quot;, buy the one with this ORIGINAL CAST!! Do not buy the one from the recent revival cast, though they were great, they do not even compare with the original.",5,Masterful,1070496000,"12 4, 2003",2003,2798,"['quot', 'Into', 'Woods', 'quot', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'title', 'belongs', 'quot', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'quot', 'proabably', 'great', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'most', 'poular', 'oft-performed', 'show', 'tremendous', 'original', 'cast', 'magical', 'songs', 'Sondheim', 'ground-breaking', 'book', 'Jame', 'Lapine', 'together', 'make', 'magical', 'Broadway', 'experience.When', 'quot', 'Into', 'Woods', 'quot', 'first', 'opened', 'Broadway', '1987', 'was', 'greeted', 'great', 'anticipation', 'was', 'be', 'newest', 'Sondheim', 'show', 'was', 'starring', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'show', 'became', 'instant', 'classic', 'audiences', 'loved', 'show.The', 'plot', 'Baker', 'Wife', 'who', 'want', 'have', 'child', 'due', 'witches', 'curse', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'find', 'quot', 'cow', 'as', 'white', 'milk', 'cape', 'as', 'red', 'blood', 'hair', 'as', 'yellow', 'corn', 'slipper', 'as', 'pure', 'gold', 'quot', 'order', 'reerse', 'curse', 'way', 'encounter', 'many', 'characters', 'well-known', 'tales', 'Cinderella', 'Little', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'Jack', 'Giant', 'Killer', 'Rapunzel', 'However', 'second', 'act', 'many', 'dark', 'twisted', 'twists', 'journey', 'what', 'happenes', 'quot', 'happily', 'ever', 'quot', 'plot', 'much', 'less', 'joyous', 'second', 'act', 'MUCH', 'less', 'happy', 'show', 'magnificent', 'outside', 'intricate', 'yet', 'followable', 'plot', 'Sondheim', 'masterful', 'songs', 'One', 'most', 'interesting', 'things', 'musical', 'however', 'metaphor', ""'ll"", 'let', 'figure', 'out', 'score', 'oft-recorded', 'songs', 'such', 'quot', 'Children', 'Will', 'Listen', 'quot', 'quot', 'One', 'Alone', 'quot', 'songs', 'are', 'great', 'mournful', 'quot', 'No', 'More', 'quot', 'hysterical', 'quot', 'Agony', 'quot', 'will', 'savor', 'moment.The', 'cast', 'including', 'Chip', 'Zein', 'Joanna', 'Gleason', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'are', 'inmaculate', 'interpretations', 'are', 'dead', 'beutiful', 'renditions', 'song', 'Especially', 'Gleason', 'Peters.The', 'show', 'won', '1988', 'Tony', 'BEST', 'SCORE', 'BEST', 'BOOK', 'BEST', 'ACTRESS', 'Joanna', 'Gleason', 'who', 'was', 'incredible', 'Baker', 'wife', 'magnificent', 'Sondheim', 'show', 'dive', 'world', 'Sondheim', '*****Two', 'Notes', '1', 'would', 'like', 'more', 'complete', 'sample', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'buy', 'quot', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'Collection', 'quot', 'Amazon.com', '6', 'DVD', 'quot', 'Into', 'Woods', 'quot', 'quot', 'Passion', 'quot', 'quot', 'Sunday', 'Park', 'George', 'quot', 'Concert', 'quot', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'quot', 'Concert', 'quot', 'Follies', 'quot', 'concerts', 'are', 'incredible', 'once-in-a-lifetime', 'event', 'quot', 'Sondheim', 'Celebration', 'Carnegie', 'Hall', 'quot', 'buy', 'cast', 'recording', 'quot', 'Woods', 'quot', 'buy', 'one', 'ORIGINAL', 'CAST', 'Do', 'not', 'buy', 'one', 'recent', 'revival', 'cast', 'were', 'great', 'do', 'not', 'even', 'compare', 'original']",Into the Woods VHS
431725,A377PFKUWVGULN,6304681372,"The Wandering Reader ""~ Love, Kisses & Magica...","[1, 1]","This musical is a family favorite. I wore my VHS out and had to repurchase it on DVD. If you've not seen this yet, I highly recommend it.This is a filmed Broadway play/musical and not a movie.  There are two acts with a brief intermission between them.  Act one, is a basic re-telling of several well loved fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm - Not the Walt Disney version of these fairy tales, but the darker versions with dark consequences.The fairy tales are woven together with the common thread of the woods that surrounds the Kingdom that they live in.The fairy tales in Act One are:CinderellaJack and the BeanstalkRapunzelLittle Red Riding HoodAnd the story of the Baker and His WifeOf course we have THE Wicked WitchA Narrator helps explain the story along and the characters interact with each other in a wonderful way that helps all the stories progress to their normal conclusion of ""Happily Ever After"".The songs (and dialogue) are wickedly funny and very entertaining.Act two begins AFTER ""Happily Ever After"".  Now, what happens after ""happily ever after""?  Well, that is indeed the best part.  So, if you've ever wondered, this is the DVD for you.  It's great family entertainment.Disclaimer:~ The only one tiny bit of concern is perhaps the wolf's costume.  One of my friend's was offended by the wolf's costume ~ in the scene where he interacts with Little Red Riding Hood in the forest.  The costume is apparently anatomically correct.  Now how she saw this, I'm not sure, but after much debate, we re-watched (after removing the children from the room) in slo-mo and it may be true, there really is a lot of fur and it wasn't that important to me, but if you think this might bother you, be advised.  I do not consider the scene sexual in any way, but she felt that scene was extremely suggestive.

431729,ANE9GJ3PLKIQG,6304681372,William R. Kirk,"[4, 4]","I have been a big fan of Into The Woods for about ten years now.  It is one musical that I certainly would like to perform in someday.  My introduction to the play was the Great Performances VHS, which I gather is the same video as the DVD.In reading the reviews for this DVD, I was happy to see the jubillant raves, but was dissapointed in reading the review with only one star.  I want to clarify someting to the web-audience.There is a point to this play.  The fairy tale characters are not introduced in order to be killed off in the second act.  Every character has to face the dark, dismal, dreary realm of the woods.  In fairy tales, the woods are always depicted as scary places that seem to have a life of their own.  This feeling of forests are still present in more modern tales like The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow.In the woods, the characters are filled with fear.  The woods is an obstacle that the fairy tale characters have to overcome in order to mature.  Each one in this musical have different motives to go into the woods, but to all of them, they are facing their deepest fears, their beasts. Once the characters enter the woods, they find that it isn't too bad, and they achieve their goals in hopes that they don't have to go to the woods again, but they do.  We will always have monsters that we have to face, but we have to be strong and persevere.  That is the main theme of the play.  This theme is obvious, but very deep and profound.  In response to the reviewer from Florida, I want to make a point that the story in this musical is more profound than anything in Shrek.  I enjoyed Shrek just as much as everyone in the world did, but it was predictable compared to the second act in Into The Woods.  The dialogue was witty in Shreck, but even wittier in Into The Woods.  I recomend this musical highly, and I suggest you give it another try.  Look beyond the first act and the fact that many characters die, and you will find morals that are deep and non-existent in any Hollywood- fare film.",4,There is a point to this play!,1007856000,"12 9, 2001",2001,2019,"['have', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Into', 'Woods', 'about', 'ten', 'years', 'now', 'one', 'musical', 'certainly', 'would', 'like', 'perform', 'someday', 'introduction', 'play', 'was', 'Great', 'Performances', 'VHS', 'gather', 'same', 'video', 'DVD.In', 'reading', 'reviews', 'DVD', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'jubillant', 'was', 'dissapointed', 'reading', 'review', 'only', 'one', 'star', 'want', 'clarify', 'someting', 'web-audience.There', 'point', 'play', 'fairy', 'tale', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'introduced', 'order', 'be', 'killed', 'off', 'second', 'act', 'character', 'face', 'dark', 'dismal', 'dreary', 'realm', 'woods', 'fairy', 'tales', 'woods', 'are', 'always', 'depicted', 'scary', 'places', 'seem', 'have', 'life', 'own', 'feeling', 'forests', 'are', 'still', 'present', 'more', 'modern', 'tales', 'Legend', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow.In', 'woods', 'characters', 'are', 'filled', 'fear', 'woods', 'obstacle', 'fairy', 'tale', 'characters', 'have', 'overcome', 'order', 'mature', 'one', 'musical', 'have', 'different', 'motives', 'go', 'woods', 'are', 'facing', 'deepest', 'fears', 'beasts', 'characters', 'enter', 'woods', 'find', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'achieve', 'goals', 'hopes', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'go', 'woods', 'again', 'do', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'monsters', 'have', 'face', 'have', 'be', 'strong', 'persevere', 'main', 'theme', 'play', 'theme', 'obvious', 'very', 'deep', 'profound', 'response', 'reviewer', 'Florida', 'want', 'make', 'point', 'story', 'musical', 'more', 'profound', 'anything', 'Shrek', 'enjoyed', 'Shrek', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'everyone', 'world', 'did', 'was', 'predictable', 'compared', 'second', 'act', 'Into', 'Woods', 'dialogue', 'was', 'witty', 'Shreck', 'even', 'wittier', 'Into', 'Woods', 'recomend', 'musical', 'highly', 'suggest', 'give', 'try', 'Look', 'first', 'act', 'fact', 'many', 'characters', 'die', 'will', 'find', 'morals', 'are', 'deep', 'non-existent', 'Hollywood-', 'fare', 'film']",Into the Woods VHS
