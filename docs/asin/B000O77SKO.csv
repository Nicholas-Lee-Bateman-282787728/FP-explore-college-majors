1062833,AUJEF31CXWTCQ,B000O77SKO,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","Eye of the Dolphin is the story of Alyssa (played by Carly Schroeder), a trouble fourteen year old girl who has lost her mother and is trying her best to cope. At wits end, Alyssa's grandmother takes her to the Bahama's, to meet her father for the first time. It is here that the story takes off.For a family film, the first fifteen minutes are a little rough for younger children. Alyssa smokes pot, hands her grandmother a condom, and expresses her teen angst. Though none of these scenes made us want to turn the film off, they caught us a bit off guard. But with that said, Alyssa's problems are not just pointless scenes. They set the table for the rest of this beautiful and touching film.The story is ultimately feel good. The cast of characters are very lovable, and you feel an instant connection with all of the actors in this film. The casting is superb. And by the end of the film, you delight in Alyssa's triumph, and feel glad that you - and your family - just invested the time to watch this movie.Uplifting and entertaining.

""Professional Word Monkey""","[18, 19]","While I didn't write this review, I thought it was important to share because it really speaks out about what's important about the movie.______________________In Eye of the Dolphin, Alyssa is a troubled teen. She's recently lost her mother and is in trouble in school (and wearing way too much make-up so we know she's troubled). When her grandmother can do no more for her, she takes Alyssa to the Bahamas to meet the father she never knew she had (and vice versa). Her father, Dr. James Hawk, is researching dolphin communication in hope of being able to understand them. Alyssa and her father must find a way to rescue her life from the edge of catastrophe. Can they each rescue each other from their troubles?OK, that sounds a lot like some kind of after school special. And in many ways, it is. That isn't saying anything bad about it, but it does have a target audience of teens and parents. Such a film may not develop characters and relationships as fully as other films might, but the film is designed to focus on an issue.The real issue that is dealt with in the film is communication. Communication and its difficulties are central to the storyline. The research into communication with dolphins serves to sets the stage for the challenges that the characters face in their struggles to hear and be heard.There are many things that get in the way of real communication. One is distraction by other voices. In the film, this is shown through the ear buds that people use while listening to iPods or earphones that Hawk often wears as he listens to the dolphins. These shut out other voices. I think the film thinks it's a good thing that in her first encounter with the dolphins, they steal Alyssa's iPod and ruin it.Yet another obstacle to communication is being too busy. Hawk especially is so consumed with his research that he doesn't pay attention to those around him, even those who can help or hinder him. It is always easy to put people off when we think we're doing something important. Often, however, we miss something far more important because we haven't been ready to listen.Sometimes we just refuse to listen. Alyssa's grandmother gave her a stack of letters that Hawk had written to her mother through the years. They are all unopened. Could what was in those letters have made any difference in their lives? Not when the words don't pass from one person to another.But the film also shows us that communication is possible. Hawk's girlfriend Tami takes Alyssa to Tami's mother's grave, where she talks to her mother. Here the film begins to tell us that true communication involves a bit of a spiritual level. Communication is not just hearing, but connecting to the other person.When Alyssa is asked if she thinks dolphins can talk, she says the problem is, ""we just don't know how to listen right."" That insight reflects all the issues that challenge the way the various characters hear (or not) one another. Listening is not just about the words, but in knowing the right way of listening, which involves connecting to one another.It is that spiritual component to listening that will provide the opportunity for the relationship between Alyssa and her father to grow and for the problems that they face to be overcome.We too need to pay attention to our communication, be it with the people around us or our communication with God. There are always obstacles to our being heard and to our listening. Often Jesus ended a parable by saying, ""Let anyone with ears to hear listen."" He really didn't mean that listening was a matter only of the ears. He also expects us to listen with our hearts, where true communication takes place.- Darrell Manson",5,"""For those with ears...""",1193011200,"10 22, 2007",2007,3677,"['did', ""n't"", 'write', 'review', 'thought', 'was', 'important', 'share', 'really', 'out', 'what', 'important', 'movie.______________________In', 'Eye', 'Dolphin', 'Alyssa', 'troubled', 'teen', 'recently', 'lost', 'mother', 'trouble', 'school', 'wearing', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'make-up', 'know', 'troubled', 'When', 'grandmother', 'can', 'do', 'more', 'Alyssa', 'Bahamas', 'meet', 'father', 'never', 'knew', 'had', 'vice', 'versa', 'father', 'Dr.', 'James', 'Hawk', 'researching', 'dolphin', 'communication', 'hope', 'being', 'able', 'understand', 'Alyssa', 'father', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'rescue', 'life', 'edge', 'catastrophe', 'Can', 'rescue', 'other', 'troubles', 'OK', 'lot', 'kind', 'school', 'special', 'many', 'ways', ""n't"", 'saying', 'anything', 'bad', 'have', 'target', 'audience', 'teens', 'parents', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'develop', 'characters', 'relationships', 'as', 'fully', 'other', 'films', 'might', 'film', 'designed', 'focus', 'issue.The', 'real', 'issue', 'dealt', 'film', 'communication', 'Communication', 'difficulties', 'are', 'central', 'storyline', 'research', 'communication', 'dolphins', 'serves', 'sets', 'stage', 'challenges', 'characters', 'face', 'struggles', 'hear', 'be', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'get', 'way', 'real', 'communication', 'One', 'distraction', 'other', 'voices', 'film', 'shown', 'ear', 'people', 'use', 'listening', 'iPods', 'earphones', 'Hawk', 'often', 'dolphins', 'shut', 'out', 'other', 'voices', 'think', 'film', 'good', 'thing', 'first', 'encounter', 'dolphins', 'steal', 'Alyssa', 'iPod', 'ruin', 'it.Yet', 'obstacle', 'communication', 'being', 'too', 'busy', 'Hawk', 'especially', 'so', 'consumed', 'research', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'even', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'hinder', 'always', 'easy', 'put', 'people', 'off', 'when', 'think', ""'re"", 'doing', 'something', 'important', 'Often', 'however', 'miss', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'important', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'ready', 'listen.Sometimes', 'just', 'refuse', 'listen', 'Alyssa', 'grandmother', 'gave', 'stack', 'letters', 'Hawk', 'had', 'written', 'mother', 'years', 'are', 'unopened', 'Could', 'what', 'was', 'letters', 'have', 'made', 'difference', 'lives', 'Not', 'when', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'pass', 'one', 'person', 'another.But', 'film', 'also', 'communication', 'possible', 'Hawk', 'girlfriend', 'Tami', 'Alyssa', 'Tami', 'mother', 'grave', 'where', 'mother', 'Here', 'film', 'tell', 'true', 'communication', 'bit', 'spiritual', 'level', 'Communication', 'not', 'just', 'hearing', 'connecting', 'other', 'person.When', 'Alyssa', 'asked', 'dolphins', 'can', 'talk', 'problem', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'listen', 'right', 'insight', 'issues', 'challenge', 'way', 'various', 'characters', 'hear', 'not', 'one', 'Listening', 'not', 'just', 'words', 'knowing', 'right', 'way', 'listening', 'connecting', 'one', 'another.It', 'spiritual', 'component', 'listening', 'will', 'provide', 'opportunity', 'relationship', 'Alyssa', 'father', 'grow', 'problems', 'face', 'be', 'overcome.We', 'too', 'need', 'pay', 'attention', 'communication', 'be', 'people', 'communication', 'God', 'are', 'always', 'obstacles', 'being', 'heard', 'listening', 'Often', 'Jesus', 'ended', 'parable', 'saying', 'Let', 'anyone', 'ears', 'hear', 'listen', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'mean', 'listening', 'was', 'matter', 'only', 'ears', 'also', 'listen', 'hearts', 'where', 'true', 'communication', 'place.-', 'Darrell', 'Manson']",N/A

1062840,A1YMUIIM0DZ68Q,B000O77SKO,"OhBo ""K Land""","[10, 10]","First let me say that I and everyone in my family thoroughly enjoyed this film. The combination of Animals (in this case Dolphins) interacting with humans, has always been appealing to audiences in Hollywood feature films, Eye of the Dolphin is no different. Aside from that and the remarkable production value with plenty of under water scenes, this is a true family movie and is a tribute to the independent film makers of the world. If you review this film like a 100 million or even 20 million dollar film, on some level that is probably flattering to the producers, as they made this film for considerably less. That being said, this film is all about communication and not just (although it is addressed) limited to communicating with dolphins, and that is something that just cannot be stressed enough in any and all families. This is a values based film and one that all parents with tweens and teens should love. Carly Schroeder has both charisma and a genuiness about her that comes across beautifully. This family drama about a parent and a child discovering each other is a must see.",5,A True Family Film !!!!,1188172800,"08 27, 2007",2007,1095,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'everyone', 'family', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'combination', 'Animals', 'case', 'Dolphins', 'interacting', 'humans', 'always', 'been', 'appealing', 'audiences', 'Hollywood', 'feature', 'films', 'Eye', 'Dolphin', 'different', 'Aside', 'remarkable', 'production', 'value', 'plenty', 'water', 'scenes', 'true', 'family', 'movie', 'tribute', 'independent', 'film', 'makers', 'world', 'review', 'film', '100', 'million', 'even', '20', 'million', 'dollar', 'film', 'level', 'probably', 'flattering', 'producers', 'made', 'film', 'considerably', 'less', 'being', 'said', 'film', 'communication', 'not', 'just', 'addressed', 'limited', 'communicating', 'dolphins', 'something', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'stressed', 'enough', 'families', 'values', 'based', 'film', 'one', 'parents', 'tweens', 'teens', 'should', 'love', 'Carly', 'Schroeder', 'charisma', 'genuiness', 'beautifully', 'family', 'parent', 'child', 'discovering', 'other', 'must', 'see']",N/A
