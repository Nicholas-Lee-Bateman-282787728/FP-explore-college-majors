308843,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6302365805,Byron Kolln,"[14, 15]","ANASTASIA: THE MYSTERY OF ANNA features a tour-de-force performance by Amy Irving in the lead role, plus an excellent, star-studded supporting cast.The miniseries is based on Peter Kurth's lengthy ""Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson"", still the most authoritive book on the woman who tried to claim the title of the murdered Duchess Anastasia.We follow the young woman, Anna Anderson, as she tries to kill herself by falling into a Berlin canal, then through the various madhouses as she slowly but surely reveals her true identity as Empress Anastasia, daughter of the Czar, thought killed along with the rest of the imperial family.Anna's plight to claim the title of Empress is marred by the efforts of the surviving Romanoffs, who all have their own motives in trying to keep the vast Romanoff fortune for themselves.  Anna's best hope of gaining acceptance is visting the Dowager Empress (Olivia de Havilland).  Anna also gains a valuable ally in Prince Erich (Jan Niklas) whom she later falls in love with.This adaptation swaps a lot of the truth in favour of fairytale romance.  There was no sweeping love story between Anna and Erich, and the film covers up a lot of the activities Anna got involved in which did nothing to help her plight (such as running around naked on the top of a New York hotel).  Ultimately, despite the fact that Duchess Anastasia's death could never be fully-determined, Anna was proven to be a fraud when DNA samples of Romanoff ancestors were compared with tissue samples of Anderson.However, this miniseries is highly-entertaining, especially the performance of Amy Irving, who invests a lot of feisty attitude and drama to the proceedings.  Olivia de Havilland is likewise very memorable as the wry and whimsical Dowager Empress.The amazing supporting cast includes Rex Harrison, Claire Bloom, Omar Sharif, Elke Sommer, Edward Fox, Susan Lucci, and Nicolas Surovy.",4,"entertaining, gripping drama",961459200,"06 20, 2000",2000,1906,"['ANASTASIA', 'MYSTERY', 'OF', 'ANNA', 'tour-de-force', 'performance', 'Amy', 'Irving', 'lead', 'role', 'excellent', 'star-studded', 'supporting', 'cast.The', 'miniseries', 'based', 'Peter', 'Kurth', 'lengthy', 'Anastasia', 'Riddle', 'Anna', 'Anderson', 'still', 'most', 'authoritive', 'book', 'woman', 'who', 'tried', 'claim', 'title', 'murdered', 'Duchess', 'Anastasia.We', 'follow', 'young', 'woman', 'Anna', 'Anderson', 'kill', 'falling', 'Berlin', 'canal', 'then', 'various', 'madhouses', 'slowly', 'surely', 'true', 'identity', 'Empress', 'Anastasia', 'daughter', 'Czar', 'thought', 'killed', 'rest', 'imperial', 'family.Anna', 'plight', 'claim', 'title', 'Empress', 'marred', 'efforts', 'surviving', 'Romanoffs', 'who', 'have', 'own', 'motives', 'trying', 'keep', 'vast', 'Romanoff', 'fortune', 'Anna', 'best', 'hope', 'gaining', 'acceptance', 'visting', 'Dowager', 'Empress', 'Olivia', 'de', 'Havilland', 'Anna', 'also', 'gains', 'valuable', 'ally', 'Prince', 'Erich', 'Jan', 'Niklas', 'whom', 'later', 'love', 'with.This', 'adaptation', 'lot', 'truth', 'favour', 'fairytale', 'romance', 'was', 'sweeping', 'love', 'story', 'Anna', 'Erich', 'film', 'up', 'lot', 'activities', 'Anna', 'got', 'involved', 'did', 'nothing', 'help', 'plight', 'such', 'running', 'around', 'naked', 'top', 'New', 'York', 'hotel', 'Ultimately', 'fact', 'Duchess', 'Anastasia', 'death', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'fully-determined', 'Anna', 'was', 'proven', 'be', 'fraud', 'when', 'DNA', 'samples', 'Romanoff', 'ancestors', 'were', 'compared', 'tissue', 'samples', 'Anderson.However', 'miniseries', 'highly-entertaining', 'especially', 'performance', 'Amy', 'Irving', 'who', 'lot', 'feisty', 'attitude', 'drama', 'proceedings', 'Olivia', 'Havilland', 'likewise', 'very', 'memorable', 'wry', 'whimsical', 'Dowager', 'Empress.The', 'amazing', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'Claire', 'Bloom', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'Elke', 'Sommer', 'Edward', 'Fox', 'Susan', 'Lucci', 'Nicolas', 'Surovy']",N/A

308846,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,6302365805,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 5]","This made-for-tv film deserved to fall into the ugly Hole of the 1980s. It is loosely based on Peter Kurth's similarly titled biography of Anna Anderson, the alleged 'impostor' Grand Duchess Anastasia.I happen to believe, in the face of the contrary scientific evidence, that Anna Anderson Manahan (Mrs.) was Anastasia. I will not launch into a tirade here--I just want to know why this film is so desperately BAD!This follows the story of a crazy girl who first identified herself as ""Mrs. Tchaikowsky"", who tried to commit suicide and eventually got herself identified as the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nicolaevna Romanov, daughter of the Czar. Though I have always detested Amy Irving, I've found she's improved with age. Here, however, she looks just plain nuts.She herself gives absolutely no ironclad clues about her past, and comes off precisely opposite of Kurth's biographical portrayal. In the end we believe she is a crazy con artist...and I feel a part of that is due to Amy Irving's incompetence as an actress.Worse than that, this film does not rightly separate characters, much less identify them. It does not demonstrate Anna's backstory well. In short, the film basically shoots Kurth in the back. It is the world's favorite thing to do when it comes to the topic of Anastasia, shoot Kurth in the back. I guess the producers wanted to play both ends against the middle in case Anna was disproved at a later date, which she was! Of course! Because life is weirder and uglier than Gollywood ever could be.I'm sorry, but I don't think this thing helped Peter Kurth or Anna Anderson Manahan's cause. This piece of garbage smells too badly.

308848,A1345VRK5MYG7,6302365805,James L.,"[21, 22]","Amy Irving stars as Anna, a woman claiming to be the youngest daughter of Czar Nicholas II of Russia, a claim which would mean that she had survived the execution of the Royal Family.  She seems to know things about the Royal Family that only Anastasia could know, yet she has huge gaps in her memory and is unable/unwilling to speak Russian.  Things are complicated by the fact that other women have claimed to be Anastasia in the past, and the Royal Family has grown tired of the pretenders to the throne.  However, Anna has her supporters, although she knows the must win the support of her grandmother, the empress, if she is to have any hope of being officially recognized.  Irving has a few good moments as Anna/Anastasia, but she doesn't project the strength that so many of the characters tell her character that she has.  The supporting cast is competent, although few are given much in the way of characters to flesh out.  The real bright spot in the film is Olivia de Havilland as the Empress.  She infuses her character with humour and wisdom, and steals her far too few scenes.  There is a narrator that appears irregularly throughout the film, and that device should have been eliminated.  The direction lacks pacing, the script could be stronger, and the ending is rather flat.  Despite the fictious romance and other weaknesses, I did find the film interesting, since the mystery surrounding Anna Anderson was one of the great puzzles of the Twentieth Century.  People argued for and against her with equal passion.  Since the film was completed, scientists appear to have proven that Anna Anderson was not Anastasia, but it would be interesting to think that maybe someone could have survived that brutal moment in history.
