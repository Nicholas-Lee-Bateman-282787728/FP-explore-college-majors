News today:Beloved actor Andy Griffith dies in NC at age 86By MARTHA WAGGONER | Associated Press - 49 mins ago...RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Griffith, 86, died Tuesday [July 3, 2012] at his home along the coast, said Dare County Sheriff Doug Doughtie.  ""Mr. Griffith passed away this morning at his home peacefully and has been laid to rest on his beloved Roanoke Island.""...In a 2007 interview with The Associated Press, Griffith said he wasn't as wise as the sheriff, nor as nice. He described himself as having the qualities of one of his last roles, that of the cranky diner owner in ""Waitress,"" and also of his most manipulative character, from the 1957 movie ""A Face in the Crowd.""  ""But I guess you could say I created Andy Taylor,"" he said. ""Andy Taylor's the best part of my mind. The best part of me.""...""His love of creating, the joy he took in it whether it was drama or comedy or his music, was inspiring to grow up around,"" [Ron] Howard said in a statement. ""The spirit he created on the set of 'The Andy Griffith Show' was joyful and professional all at once. It was an amazing environment.""...""The Andy Griffith Show"" was a loving portrait of the town where few grew up but many wished they did -- a place where all foibles are forgiven and friendships are forever. Villains came through town and moved on, usually changed by their stay in Mayberry. ""That was all a credit to Griffith,"" said casting director Craig Fincannon, ""and Andy Griffith's the reason for that.""...When asked in 2007 to name his favorite episodes, the ones atop Griffith's list were the shows that emphasized Knotts' character.  ""The second episode that we shot I knew Don should be funny and I should play straight for him,"" Griffith said. ""That opened up the whole series because I could play straight for everybody else. And I didn't have to be funny. I just let them be funny.""...""Few people in this world will ever have more influence on our lives than Andy Griffith,"" [Brad] Paisley [who made a 2008 award winning music video with Andy Griffith] said in a statement. ""An actor who never looked like he was acting, a moral compass who saved as many souls as most preachers, and an entertainer who put smiles on more faces than almost anyone; this was as successful a life as is pretty much possible.""...He[Griffith] was inducted into the Academy of Television Arts Hall of Fame in 1992...  More recently, Griffith won a Grammy in 1997 for his album of gospel music ""I Love to Tell the Story -- 25 Timeless Hymns.""...  In 2005, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the country's highest civilian honors....""On this day of remembering a wonderful, complex man, I am both sad and grateful.

1055186,A1GY4VWXY0747S,B000NA21YA,FredCritic,"[1, 2]","One of the major reasons this show's lasted this long in syndication and has garnered so much respect is because it has a lot more reality to it than many of the other shows from its era (Bachelor Father, The Donna Reed Show, and loads of others).For example, competent people are the exception and not the rule in Mayberry, as is the case in the real world. Andy Taylor is one of the few competent/relatively sane people in Mayberry. In the real world, there are a lot more Barney Fifes than Andy Taylors.If the creators of this series were interested in portraying reality, it was key for them not to make Sheriff Andy Taylor perfect. So they gave him at least one relatively major flaw: A sadistic, almost bullying, streak. From time to time, he treats Barney in a very sadistic manner. He teases Barney in a major way and seems to get a giant kick out of Barney's typical humiliated, angry reaction.And then there's Barney's womanizing. Hilarious. And, once again, here is something that is not uncommon in the real world.I wholeheartedly believe that it would have been an entirely different show if they had whitewashed the town of Mayberry and its inhabitants. And it would not have enjoyed the long run it's had and the respect it's garnered.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------One more note.

The Darlin's get on my nerves anyway, and they weren't that funny..... As for WHERE ARE THE EXTRAS... people get over it. I think some people buy a damn move or in this case a box set for the extras. The series ended in 1968. They were not concerned about telling the future of adding extras to DVD which of course didn't exist then. I hope no one expected them to hunt down the living cast for interviews.  I guess if your wanting  10 hours of extras and the lost Darling's song you will just have to do without.

The missing epilogue and minutes to ""The Darlings Are Coming"" and the missing epilogue to ""Barney Mends a Broken Heart"" from season 3 were not restored to this set. The laugh tracks to a few episodes from season 4 have been restored, but that wasn't a big deal to me.The ""extra extras"" you get from this series box set are available individually elsewhere if you look around.  The pilot ""Danny Meets Andy Griffith"" is available edited on the ""Make Room for Daddy"" 5th season DVD set.  The pilot included here is also edited.  You can also find ""Return to Mayberry"" on DVD online and the other bonus is the episode ""Opie Joins the Marines"" where Opie visits Gomer on ""Gomer Pyle USMC,"" which will be released in that series' second season set in a few months. I wish Paramount could have gathered some behind-the-scenes stuff or commentaries or interviews (the actors are not getting any younger and in just the past few years, many important TAGS people have died like Howard Morris and Don Knotts).  That would have made this set worth it, but nothing like that is included.What bugs me the most, though, is the crummy packaging: Cardboard folders and pockets with cut-out photos on the characters printed on it.  At least make it the same as the individual sets with the plastic, easy-to-use holders and the bold and colorful illustrations.  It's a great series, I love the shows (even the color episodes), but if you have already bought the seasons and are wondering if the series set is worth it, I would vote, 'no.'

I remember tuning in -- just once or twice -- out of curiousity, but that's all.  Why?  It seemed SO corny...so full of simple, (if not stupid), ""country folk"".  No girls or women, (except older ""Aunt Bee""), that we knew of, to be role-models for my sister and I whilst we watched it.  Living in New York City -- even if not in Manhatten, but in Queens -- GLAMOUR was on our minds.  Being, (although not then knowing it), an ""Indigo"" person, ROYALTY was ALWAYS on at least my own mind.  WHY anyone would EVER watch a program like this was then totally beyond my understanding.  The people on ""THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW"" seemed to be 1960s people stuck in the country ways of the 1860s.  Yes, they had electricity, and cars, too -- but did they ever go to the LIBRARY?  (They probably didn't even HAVE a library in that forgotten, backwater town...or village!)  Stores?  An occasional roadway shows being put on in the high-school, (did thy HAVE a high-school?)  Formal (or even informal) dining rooms? Paved roads....running water?  Gas or electric stoves....not wood-burning ones?  Paved roads?  Running water?  It seemed to me that his was ""Cornsville USA"", and that the only person with a spark of intelligence living in it was Andy Griffith's sheriff.  (And I wondered why he didn't move away....?)Well, Amazon has put the entire series on sale today...and on an impulse, I have bought it.  My niece tells me that at college, she was taught that all poor people are stupid, (which made me wonder a little bit about how Abraham Lincoln fitted into this equation....or our own ancestors, who came to North America with absolutely nothing but each other....)  I have heard stories about organizations which set up meetings for VERY rich and powerful people, at which, during the start of every conclave, a baby, (in EFFIGY), is burnt before the crowd....heralding the message, ""The End of Care"".  I have also heard stories about ""the Illuminated Ones"" wanting to get the population of Earth DOWN, from 6 billion to 160 thousand....so that, after 2012, we'll all be easier to control......Well, shows like ""The Andy Griffith Show, Complete Series"" counter that sort of super-duper-elitist thinking.  I THINK....as I have not yet seen even three complete episodes.  I KNOW that shows like ""Father Knows Best"", ""The Donna Reed Show"", ""The Waltons"", and even ""Star Trek"", (and certainly, ""Alien Nation - The Series""), do.  It's possible that evepoor people can think of themselves as superiour....if they look down upon handicapped, older, drunk, fat, and other minority people.....Happily, 'THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW, COMPLETE SERIES"", remains near the top of Amazon's lists in it's categories.  Why?  Certainly NOT because those with DVD players WANT to return to a simplistic way of life....No.  As Herbert W. Armstrong, an early televangelist once said, (and proved), everyone has a reason to be alive, and everyone should be RESPECTED for wanting to stay alive.  (Mr. Armstrong -- a very broadminded man -- said to a Jewish viewer, (who liked Mr. Armstrong's broadasts, but had trouble with so much use of the words ""Jesus"" and ""Christ"" in these programs, ""Just substitute ""God"" when I say those words).  So, I have resolved to watch 'THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW, THE COMPLETE SERIES', and see why it was, and remains, so popular.I suspect this show proves there is a COMMON humanity in EVERYONE.  If so, it should definitely be seen by as many people as possible.  Espcially those who go to meetings where the first thing they see is a playlet-tableau, showing ""the death of care"".In these days when it seems we need ""care"" the most!(To Be Continued....)",5,"'.....W H A T......D O......T H E......S I M P L E.....F O L K S.....D O...?

Most people will love the first five seasons in black and white that featured Don Knotts, but all of the seasons have their appeal.If you don't have the entire series, or just a couple of seasons, this set will be worth it.

For those who already have one or more seasons, the new extras in this new all-season set are no big whoop and in my opinion is not worth purchasing.The pilot episode included in this set is a syndicated version which is edited by about 2 and a half minutes. This is the same version already available on the Make Room For Daddy - The Complete Fifth Season DVD set. The full length pilot had been released on VHS, but has been out-of-print for a few years now. Why couldn't Paramount include the full length version? We know it exists.The two edited episodes in Season 3 remain edited. ""The Darlings Are Coming"" is the heavily cut syndicated version. ""Barney Mends A Broken Heart"" is still missing its epilogue. Source material does exist that would restore these episodes.The episodes on discs 1 and 2 of Season 4 that were missing the laugh tracks have been corrected (with the odd exception of the last few minutes of ""A Black Day For Mayberry"" and ""The Sermon For Today"", where the laughter has still not been re-inserted), but this was done way before this new box set was ever announced. If you have these discs without the laugh tracks, I believe Paramount is still replacing them with the corrected ones. See my review of Season 4 for more details.The ""Opie Joins The Marines"" episode of Gomer Pyle, USMC has been included. However, this will be released anyway when Season 2 of that series rolls around in a few months.The TV movie, ""Return To Mayberry"" finally makes it's way to DVD as a bonus feature in this set. It is uncut and presented just as originally broadcast in 1986. Hopefully it will be released as a separate disc for those who already have some or all of this series.Without even going into the packaging issues, this new box set is already somewhat of a disappointment.
