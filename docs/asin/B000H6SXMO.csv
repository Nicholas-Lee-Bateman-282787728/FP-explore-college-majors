They keep this in the car and play it frequently as they travel around going to practices and games. They both love it, have learned from it, and been inspired by it. It's something they can watch repeatedly without being bored.I told my nephews I was looking forward to wearing their jersey's when they are on a NHL team!

1010509,A13TVF86XC4O42,B000H6SXMO,Curmudgeonly Grammarian,"[1, 1]","There are a large number of great moments in the sport on this DVD, from the earliest days of the NHL until the present.  It doesn't skip any particular set of years in favor of others, and contains a good mix of different moments. Particular note is the ONLY record not held by Wayne Gretzky: Most total points in a game.  Of the 62 possible records for non-goalies, the Great One holds 61. Kudos to the makers for noting this, as it was an impressive performance by the player who holds the record.  This is a good hockey fan collection of sweet plays. One item missing: The penalty against goalie Patrick Roy for going past the red line. This was most notable precisely because Roy actually out-deked Wayne Gretzky while skating toward center ice- no mean feat for anyone, let alone a guy in ful goalie pads!  Great DVD for any hockey fan- or as a break-in intro for novices.",5,Hockey Highlights- just like it says.,1374537600,"07 23, 2013",2013,878,"['are', 'large', 'number', 'great', 'moments', 'sport', 'DVD', 'earliest', 'days', 'NHL', 'present', ""n't"", 'skip', 'particular', 'set', 'years', 'favor', 'others', 'good', 'mix', 'different', 'moments', 'Particular', 'note', 'ONLY', 'record', 'not', 'held', 'Wayne', 'Gretzky', 'Most', 'total', 'points', 'game', '62', 'possible', 'records', 'non-goalies', 'Great', 'One', '61', 'Kudos', 'makers', 'noting', 'was', 'impressive', 'performance', 'player', 'who', 'record', 'good', 'hockey', 'fan', 'collection', 'sweet', 'plays', 'One', 'item', 'missing', 'penalty', 'goalie', 'Patrick', 'Roy', 'going', 'red', 'line', 'was', 'most', 'notable', 'precisely', 'Roy', 'actually', 'out-deked', 'Wayne', 'Gretzky', 'skating', 'center', 'ice-', 'mean', 'feat', 'anyone', 'let', 'alone', 'guy', 'ful', 'goalie', 'pads', 'Great', 'DVD', 'hockey', 'fan-', 'break-in', 'intro', 'novices']",NHL Greatest Moments

1010511,ASRF2CW7M4IJ0,B000H6SXMO,M.Y.,"[3, 5]","This DVD is similar to the NFL version. It's great to see past and present heroes but I feel the DVD lacks content. There's just so much more that could of been part of this DVD. Who knows, maybe there's a plan to make a volume 2. Alot of stars and their moments could of been added. Nevertheless, it's a great DVD to have. I'm a big Mario Lemieux fan, and to see him fight his illness and regain the MVP was awesome. They've even added a little on Sidney Crosby's moments on draft day.
