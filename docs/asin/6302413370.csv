310802,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6302413370,Acute Observer,"[1, 2]","The Gallant Hours, 1959 filmThe story begins with a view of the top of a Navy ship. Admiral William F. Halsey Jr. is retiring at age 62 in November 1945. They talk about the battle of Guadalcanal in November 1942. A Japanese submarine sends a report of a Navy flying boat. A routine matter? [Never underestimate your enemy.] Yamamoto orders fighter airplanes to attack it. Halsey is put in charge of the defense of Guadalcanal. Gormley explains the problems there. The Japanese quickly learn of the change in command. [From the newspapers?] Halsey issues orders. Tropical diseases affect the troops, supplies are lacking. ""Where is the Navy?"" Guadalcanal must be held! Halsey changes orders. ""How good is our intelligence?"" Halsey avoids his medical vaccinations, then arrives at Guadalcanal with some supplies. Halsey inspects the front lines and the wounded. ""God bless you."" Halsey meets Joe Foss, the first ace of the war and future Governor of South Dakota. Tom Lamphier too.There is an air raid at night. Halsey explains the purpose of this battle: to stop the enemy. Yamamoto has his plan to win. Halsey also has a plan, to attack first. Halsey calculates the Japanese won't continue their attack. All mechanics will repair the ""Enterprise"". His judgment is correct, the Japs turned back. Losses shouldn't cause a resignation. The Japanese will attack on November 11. Will they change their code? The Americans prepare for the attack. An American float plane is overdue. Yamamoto decides to visit the front lines to inspire his troops.Have the Americans lost track of the enemy's forces? ""Contact!"" We hear guns firing. Two Admirals were lost in the battle. Halsey gets a fourth star. A battleship will be sent into narrow seas. The Japanese code is broken just in time! Can they find Yamamoto in the air? The Jap transport ships continue to sail. Fighter planes are quickly serviced to send them back on another sortie. There is good news about shooting Yamamoto's planes down. [Has the tide turned?] Halsey is now rowed ashore to mark his retirement. ""There are no great men, only great challenges that ordinary men are forced to meet.""This low budget war story explains the strategy and history of the Battle of Guadalcanal in November 1942 from the viewpoint of Halsey. There is little drama from personalities. The Battle of Midway in June 1942 marked the start of the defeat of Imperial Japan. The ambush of Yamamoto occurred in April 1943, months after the battle of Guadalcanal. Hollywood does drama and entertainment, not history.

James Cagneys understated performance does credit to the admiral's personality.  Admiral Halsey was not one to avoid a fight, and he did'nt do so in the Solomons campaign.  I have just one criticism of this film.  It should have been longer, there was much more to Admiral Halseys careeer in the pacific war, but these battles were not shown.  It is true that Admiral Halsey is a contraversial figure in WW11.  I say this in light of the contraversy regarding the Battle of Lyete Gulf.  It should also be noted that Amiral Halsey is one of the few five-star admirals in the history of the U.S. Navy.

310815,AZUBX0AYYNTFF,6302413370,Donald M. Bishop,"[7, 8]","From its opening frames -- a lookout standing attention on the mast of a battleship at anchor and a haunting song by the Robert Shaw Chorale -- this 1959 film about Fleet Admiral William Halsey has a strikingly different mood than most ""biopics.""Set mostly in 1942 and 1943 during the campaign for Guadalcanal, the gifted screenplay by Beirne Lay Jr. and Frank Gilroy is a study of high command.  Its scenes make the point that turning points in history depend on the human element -- great commanders, great lieutenants, aides, and the courage and will of ordinary men and women who move at their command and fight on their orders.The film's gravitas and its special mood are sustained by the use of narrative that fleshes out scenes and the background of minor characters.  Occasionally the narrative flashes forward (""First Lieutenant Harrison Ludlum, aged 28, occupation, printer, married, two children:  thirty-six hours from now a sniper's bullet will make him a paraplegic"") in a way that dramatically conveys, even without ""action,"" the stakes of the war in the Pacific.It's the nature of ""biopics"" to compress large issues and perhaps airbrush shortcomings and mistakes.  Historic timelines are changed to fit story lines -- in this film too.  No doubt close students of Admiral Halsey can voice other critical asides.  In the end, though, it is victory that counts, and the hundreds of thousands of Americans who served under Halsey in the Pacific told their grandchildren that they had served under one of history's great captains.The haunting song that does so much to establish and sustain the film's special mood is a hornpipe, ""The Gallant Hours Theme,"" written by the actor Ward Costello, who plays Captain Harry Black in the film.  Various transcriptions of the song on the net are messy and incomplete.  Here it is, as sung:I knew a lad who went to sea and left the shore behind him,I knew him well, the lad was me, and now I cannot find him.Away, away, away he went to deep and salty waters.His girl she waited years for him, she was his neighbor's daughter.Away, away, away he went and left the shore behind him.I knew him well, the lad was me, and now I cannot find him.Away, away, away he went (away he went) and now I cannot find him.The rolling sea he would embrace, the rolling sea has took himAnd passed him on a lonely beach, the roaring sea forsook him.Away, away, away he went and now I cannot find him.Away, away, away he went (away he went) and now I cannot find him.-30-",5,"A haunting song, a strikingly different mood, a standout among biopics",1291680000,"12 7, 2010",2010,2502,"['opening', 'frames', 'lookout', 'standing', 'attention', 'mast', 'battleship', 'anchor', 'haunting', 'song', 'Robert', 'Shaw', 'Chorale', '1959', 'film', 'Fleet', 'Admiral', 'William', 'Halsey', 'strikingly', 'different', 'mood', 'most', 'biopics', 'Set', 'mostly', '1942', '1943', 'campaign', 'Guadalcanal', 'gifted', 'screenplay', 'Beirne', 'Lay', 'Jr.', 'Frank', 'Gilroy', 'study', 'high', 'command', 'scenes', 'make', 'point', 'turning', 'points', 'history', 'depend', 'human', 'element', 'great', 'commanders', 'great', 'lieutenants', 'aides', 'courage', 'will', 'ordinary', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'move', 'command', 'fight', 'orders.The', 'film', 'gravitas', 'special', 'mood', 'are', 'sustained', 'use', 'narrative', 'out', 'scenes', 'background', 'minor', 'characters', 'Occasionally', 'narrative', 'flashes', 'forward', 'First', 'Lieutenant', 'Harrison', 'Ludlum', 'aged', '28', 'occupation', 'printer', 'married', 'two', 'children', 'thirty-six', 'hours', 'now', 'sniper', 'bullet', 'will', 'make', 'paraplegic', 'way', 'dramatically', 'conveys', 'even', 'action', 'stakes', 'war', 'Pacific.It', 'nature', 'biopics', 'compress', 'large', 'issues', 'perhaps', 'airbrush', 'shortcomings', 'mistakes', 'Historic', 'timelines', 'are', 'changed', 'fit', 'story', 'lines', 'film', 'too', 'No', 'doubt', 'close', 'students', 'Admiral', 'Halsey', 'can', 'voice', 'other', 'critical', 'asides', 'end', 'victory', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'Americans', 'who', 'served', 'Halsey', 'Pacific', 'told', 'grandchildren', 'had', 'served', 'one', 'history', 'great', 'captains.The', 'haunting', 'song', 'so', 'much', 'establish', 'sustain', 'film', 'special', 'mood', 'hornpipe', 'Gallant', 'Hours', 'Theme', 'written', 'actor', 'Ward', 'Costello', 'who', 'Captain', 'Harry', 'Black', 'film', 'Various', 'transcriptions', 'song', 'net', 'are', 'messy', 'incomplete', 'Here', 'sung', 'knew', 'lad', 'who', 'went', 'sea', 'left', 'shore', 'knew', 'well', 'lad', 'was', 'now', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'him.Away', 'away', 'away', 'went', 'deep', 'salty', 'waters.His', 'girl', 'waited', 'years', 'was', 'neighbor', 'daughter.Away', 'away', 'away', 'went', 'left', 'shore', 'him.I', 'knew', 'well', 'lad', 'was', 'now', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'him.Away', 'away', 'away', 'went', 'away', 'went', 'now', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'him.The', 'rolling', 'sea', 'would', 'embrace', 'rolling', 'sea', 'took', 'himAnd', 'passed', 'lonely', 'beach', 'roaring', 'sea', 'forsook', 'him.Away', 'away', 'away', 'went', 'now', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'him.Away', 'away', 'away', 'went', 'away', 'went', 'now', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'him.-30-']",N/A
310816,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6302413370,Dr. James Gardner,"[4, 5]","""The Gallant Hours"" is a 1960 biopic/docudrama about Admiral Bull Halsey's campaign in the Pacific. It covers a 5 week period in 1942 when Halsey took command of the 3rd Fleet and focuses on the battle for Guadalcanal and the assassination of Yamamoto (which actually took place several months later).Halsey was a distinguished sailor, winner of the Navy Cross, Navy Distinguished Service Medal (with 3 gold stars), Army Distinguished Service Medal, etc. He was promoted to Fleet Admiral in 1945 and two warships (a Cruiser and Destroyer) are named after him. In addition to Cagney, he has been played by James Whitmore (""Tora, Tora, Tora""), Robert Mitchum (""Midway""), Kenneth Tobey (""MacArthur"") and Glenn Morshower (""Pearl Harbor""). Halsey's creed was - ""There are no great men, only great challenges..."" He died in 1959, before the film came out, although he had been involved in pre-production.Jimmy Cagney plays Halsey and he is assisted by a large cast that includes Dennis Weaver and  Richard Jaeckel.It was 61 year old Jimmy Cagney's 60th film, and one of his last. Cagney was one of the biggest stars of the 30s, nominated for an Oscar for ""Angels with Dirty Faces"" (1938) and won for ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" (1942). While he is best known for his gangster roles (e.g., ""Public Enemy"", ""Roaring Twenties"" ""White Heat"" ), the majority of Cagney's screen appearances were not as a gangster - he played  an insurance salesman (""The Millionaire"", 1931), an engineer (""Other Men's Women"", 1931),  a boxer (""Winner Take All"", 1932), an auto racer (""The Crowd Roars"", 1932), a Broadway producer (""Footlight Parade"", 1933), etc. Indeed, Cagney often appeared in comedies (e.g., ""Here Comes the Navy"", ""Hard to Handle"", ""Jimmy the Gent""), although it was his gangster films that earned the really big bucks. This is probably Cagney's last good performance. Interestingly enough, he looked like Halsey and was close to the same age. Cagney met with Halsey twice, and he felt under pressure to give a good performance.Dennis Weaver is best known for his years on ""Gunsmoke"" as Chester and his detective series ""McCloud"", but he also had a distinguished career in films such as ""Touch of Evil"" and ""Duel"" (1971). He received two Emmy nominations for ""Gunsmoke"" and for ""McCloud"" and won once (1955). Weaver plays an aide to Halsey.Richard Jaeckel appeared in more than 100 films. He was nominated for an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor opposite Paul Newman in ""Sometimes a Great Notion"" (1970) but is probably remembered best for his role as the Sergeant in ""The Dirty Dozen"" (1967). He has a cameo in the film as a bomber pilot.The film is directed by Robert Montgomery. Montgomery was a well known actor and was twice nominated for an Oscar (""Night Must Fall"" in 1937 and ""Here Comes Mr. Jordan"" in 1941). He was also a film director and worked on several films (""They Were Expendable"" in 1945, ""Your Witness"" in 1950) and also wore the hat of a producer and for several years work on TV with his series ""Robert Montgomery Presents"" during the golden era of TV. His daughter, Elizabeth, is best known as the witch Samantha from ""Bewitched"". Montgomery personally knew Halsey and had served as a Lieutenant Commander in WW 2. ""The Gallant Hours"" was Montgomery's last film effort in any capacity.Cagney and Montgomery were good friends. Cagney made a rare TV appearance in Montgomery's ""Soldiers from the war returning"" in 1956 and they co-produced ""The Gallant Hours"". Montgomery doesn't appear, but he does the narration. Both their sons appear in the film, uncredited, as Marines.The screenplay was written by Frank Gilroy and Beirne Lay. Gilroy was the award winning author of ""The Subject was Roses"" (1965). Lay was a combat vet and pilot from WW2, held the rank of Lt. Colonel, and understood the military mind. He co-wrote  the 1948 novel ""Twelve O'Clock High"" (1949) and adapted it for the film. His other war films include ""Flying Leathernecks"" (1951) and ""Strategic Air Command"" (1955).Bosley Crowther (New York Times) said ""...Cagney's performance, controlled to the last detail, gives life and strong, heroic stature to the principal figure in the film."" The film is more like a docudrama than a war film, and there is very little traditional action. Instead we get to observe what went on behind locked doors as the Japanese high command and Halsey and his commanders plot and counter plot in an attempt to control Guadalcanal. It is a crucial battle, and victory here will  give the prevailing party command of the entire South Pacific.Beyond the strategic plotting, the film often stops for a moment and gives us biographical information about the people on the screen, including where they came from, their education, family status, and more interestingly, what will become of them. Some will die or be wounded within a few hours, and some will go on to become Governors. It's really interesting to see.Fans of war films will really enjoy this movie as it gives a perspective rarely seen. Jimmy Cagney fans wil enjoy seeing the master at work one more time.",4,Excellent docudrama about Guadalcanal,1272672000,"05 1, 2010",2010,5068,"['Gallant', 'Hours', '1960', 'biopic/docudrama',

Kuczma ""RogueUlfric""","[141, 143]","Basically, The Gallant Hours is an episodic biography of Admiral William &quot;Bull&quot; Halsey during the early days of the Second World War, specifically while he was the naval theater commander for the Guadalcanal  campaign.James Cagney is superb in this very unusual war film, which has  no combat footage, relying instead on character development and the  intensity of interpersonal relationships to tell its story.Although  Admiral Halsey (Cagney) is the central figure, the movie also closely  follows the involvement of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, the Japanese theater  commander, giving the viewer an interesting and enlightening counterpoint  persective in the attitudes, concerns and approaches of the opposing  leaders.The most remarkable feature of The Gallant Hours is its  willingness and effectiveness to show emotions seldom dealt with in  military movies.  One of these shows Halsey in the horrific dilemma of  knowing that he is sending two close friends (Admirals Scott and Callaghan)  to certain death, but being constrained by circumstance from any alternate  course of action.  In yet another sequence, Dennis Weaver gives a brilliant  portrayal of a combat pilot dealing with the conflicting emotions of being  relieved at having survived his mission and yet feeling both disgust and  shame for what he is doing as he and his command &quot;roll up a big  score.&quot;For the individual who wants a serious treatment of the  personal effects of warfare, without the usual rah-rah, flag-waving and  stereotyped villification of opposing forces, The Gallant Hours is a  sobering, not to be forgotten movie experience.The masterful combination  of taut direction, a superior cast, eerie soundtrack and a very unusual  approach make this remarkable film a must for any military video library.",5,A brilliant depiction of the price of leadership. . .,945820800,"12 22, 1999",1999,1810,"['Basically', 'Gallant', 'Hours', 'episodic', 'biography', 'Admiral', 'William', 'quot', 'Bull', 'quot', 'Halsey', 'early', 'days', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'specifically', 'was', 'naval', 'theater', 'commander', 'Guadalcanal', 'campaign.James', 'Cagney', 'superb', 'very', 'unusual', 'war', 'film', 'combat', 'footage', 'relying', 'instead', 'character', 'development', 'intensity', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'tell', 'story.Although', 'Admiral', 'Halsey', 'Cagney', 'central', 'figure', 'movie', 'also', 'closely', 'involvement', 'Admiral', 'Isoroku', 'Yamamoto', 'Japanese', 'theater', 'commander', 'giving', 'viewer', 'interesting', 'enlightening', 'counterpoint', 'persective', 'attitudes', 'concerns', 'approaches', 'opposing', 'leaders.The', 'most', 'remarkable', 'feature', 'Gallant', 'Hours', 'willingness', 'effectiveness', 'show', 'emotions', 'seldom', 'dealt', 'military', 'movies', 'One', 'shows', 'Halsey', 'horrific', 'dilemma', 'knowing', 'sending', 'two', 'close', 'friends', 'Admirals', 'Scott', 'Callaghan', 'certain', 'death', 'being', 'constrained', 'circumstance', 'alternate', 'course', 'action', 'yet', 'sequence', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'brilliant', 'portrayal', 'combat', 'pilot', 'dealing', 'conflicting', 'emotions', 'being', 'relieved', 'having', 'survived', 'mission', 'yet', 'feeling', 'disgust', 'shame', 'what', 'doing', 'command', 'quot', 'roll', 'up', 'big', 'score.', 'quot', 'individual', 'who', 'serious', 'treatment', 'personal', 'effects', 'warfare', 'usual', 'rah-rah', 'flag-waving', 'stereotyped', 'villification', 'opposing', 'forces', 'Gallant', 'Hours', 'sobering', 'not', 'be', 'forgotten', 'movie', 'experience.The', 'masterful', 'combination', 'taut', 'direction', 'superior', 'cast', 'soundtrack', 'very', 'unusual', 'approach', 'make', 'remarkable', 'film', 'must', 'military', 'video', 'library']",N/A
310825,ASPL0SF3VVEZH,6302413370,John H.,"[1, 1]","The exceptional leader and fine patriot Admiral Halsey had a dramatic, adventurous life, particularly during WWII.  If you want to hear the voice of the real man, speaking, British Path&eacute; has an excellent short video up (YouTube) called ""Admiral Halsey Reports.""Regarding ""The Gallant Hours,"" with all the acting talent and all those actual Navy veterans advising and involved, one would have expected a much, much better outcome than this film.  I had really wanted to give this film 5 stars.  It should have been made to cover a longer period in Admiral Halsey's WWII career, more along the lines of the excellent ""MacArthur"" movie with Gregory Peck.For the first 20 minutes or more, it did not seem that there was a war on at all.  The actors are totally relaxed and seem to have had plenty of sleep (though they talk about being sleep-deprived).  Scene after scene looks like a typical apartment or office set on a Hollywood soundstage.  The lack of realism infects the writing too.  Cagney says he wants to see so and so (apparently on the same ship or even in the next compartment), ""in ...."" --then makes a LONG dramatic pause -- and follows with a half-stammered ""5 minutes""!  Gee, I held my breath thinking it might be 7 and a 1/2, or 4 and 30 seconds.  After a scene begins in Japanese with actors portraying the enemy, the Narrator says, ""For those who didn't understand what was just said ...""!  Was that supposed to be funny to American audiences with a film in English?!  I laughed out loud.The very somber chorale was fine for the opening credits, but then seems to have been put into scenes where it doesn't fit, where in fact nothing is happening.  It becomes inappropriate.  It sounds like that heavy opening Tchaikovsky chorus from the ""War of 1812 Overture"" and is inserted throughout the film.Admiral Halsey's story calls for battle scenes.  They are key to the story.  In this film, there's a lot of Cagney staring at the wall or staring out into space.  There's a lot of quiet actors standing around or everybody looking at the door on cue.  I don't remember military service being like that, when work was being done and decisions were being made.Cagney, a fine actor, should have taken the time to learn how to make a real military salute.  It's minor, but his half-effort reach up toward his nose gets to be distracting.  I never saw any senior ranking officer ""salute"" like that, because they all know better.  Similarly, some of the military discipline in many of the group or room scenes seems grossly inaccurate, since the advisers on hand undoubtedly knew better.This leaves this film as merely interesting to watch for some of the historical references.

The framing device is Halsey's retirement ceremony and the film begins with a moving choral arranged by Roger Wagner that tells us: &quot;I knew a lad who went to sea / and left the shore behind him / I knew him well the lad was me / and now I cannot find him.&quot;  The hymn sets an almost religious tone for the film that seems rather strange given the events depicted and the approach of the director.  Contrast this with the running bit about getting Admiral Halsey to take his shots.The film is directed by U.S.N.R. Comdr. Robert Montgomery, the actor who served in the Navy during World War II but who is better remembered today as being the father of actress Elizabeth Montgomery.  One of the most surprising things about this film is that is a war movie without any battle scenes.  There are battles, but we hear about them rather than see them.  Mostly &quot;The Gallant Hours&quot; is about Halsey's command decisions and the way he worked with his subordinates (when the Chief of Staff of the admiral he replaces because he provides contrary views).  There are many scenes that consist mainly of a subordinate bringing Halsey dispatches and him thoughtfully coming up with responses.Halsey, as the cover art emphasizes, is James Cagney, in what would prove to be his second to last film before he retired from acting for twenty years.  Having met with Halsey, Cagney was struck by how the navy man hardly made any extraneous gestures, and the actor made a point of excising all of his well-known mannerisms from the performance.  Cagney's presence is critical to the film because with it this 115-minute film would have been tedious.  However, his presence allows Montgomery to focus on the decision making process during a war in more detail than any other film that comes to mind (&quot;Command Decision&quot; would be in the running, but this one has it beat).  Clearly you can do a talking head war movie when the main talking head is James Cagney.The film is as much about the duel between Halsey and his Japanese counterpart, Admiral Yamamoto (James T. Goto), which becomes not only a question of winning the battle to control Guadacanal but a personal attempt to kill each other.  The Japanese commander is portrayed as a worthy opponent and there is as much attention to the aspects of his work as there is to that of Halsey.  Biographical details abound in this documentary.  Every time Halsey meets somebody a voice over tells us not only who they are but what is going to happen to them.  The guy who is driving the jeep is an hour away from being short by a sniper and becoming a paraplegic for the rest of his life.  A squad heads out on Guadacanal and we learn that only three of them are coming back.  The details are such that I would have sworn this film was adapted from a book, but there is no book by that title or any other work cited as the source for this story.The screenplay is by Frank D. Gilroy and Beirne Lay Jr.  Lay was the co-author of &quot;Twelve O'Clock High&quot; and it is interesting that like the film version of that classic World War II novel there is a scene in which the central character waits out a pivotal moment alone in his office, living out the battle in his own mind.  In case you are not sure what the moral of &quot;The Gallant Hours&quot; happens to be, Cagney reminds us with a voice over at the end: &quot;There are no great men, only great challenges that ordinary men are forced by circumstances to meet.&quot;  Of course, &quot;The Gallant Hours&quot; pretty much disproves that point, at least with regards to the man at the top in the South Pacific.",4,James Cagney as Rear Admiral &quot;Bull&quot; Halsey,1083283200,"04 30, 2004",2004,3955,"['quot', 'Gallant', 'Hours', 'quot', 'one', 'more', 'usual', 'bio-pics', 'military', 'leader', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'semi-documentary', 'dramatization', 'pivotal', 'role', 'Rear', 'Admiral', 'William', 'F.', 'quot', 'Bull', 'quot', 'Halsey', 'Jr.', 'played', 'commander', 'U.S.', 'naval', 'operation', 'South', 'Pacific', 'bringing', 'victory', 'Guadacanal', 'framing', 'device', 'Halsey', 'retirement', 'ceremony', 'film', 'moving', 'choral', 'arranged', 'Roger', 'Wagner', 'quot', 'knew', 'lad', 'who', 'went', 'sea', '/', 'left', 'shore', '/', 'knew', 'well', 'lad', 'was', '/', 'now', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'him.', 'quot', 'hymn', 'almost', 'religious', 'tone', 'film', 'rather', 'strange', 'given', 'events', 'depicted', 'approach', 'director', 'Contrast', 'running', 'bit', 'getting', 'Admiral', 'Halsey', 'take', 'shots.The', 'film', 'directed', 'U.S.N.R', 'Comdr', 'Robert', 'Montgomery', 'actor', 'who', 'served', 'Navy', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'who', 'better', 'remembered', 'today', 'being', 'father', 'actress', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'One', 'most', 'surprising', 'things', 'film', 'war', 'movie', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'battles', 'hear', 'rather', 'see', 'Mostly', 'quot', 'Gallant', 'Hours', 'quot', 'Halsey', 'command', 'decisions', 'way', 'worked', 'subordinates', 'when', 'Chief', 'Staff', 'admiral', 'contrary', 'views', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'consist', 'mainly', 'subordinate', 'bringing', 'Halsey', 'dispatches', 'thoughtfully', 'coming', 'up', 'responses.Halsey', 'cover', 'art', 'James', 'Cagney', 'what', 'would', 'prove', 'be', 'second', 'last', 'film', 'retired', 'acting', 'twenty', 'years', 'Having', 'met', 'Halsey', 'Cagney', 'was', 'struck', 'how', 'navy', 'man', 'hardly', 'made', 'extraneous', 'gestures', 'actor', 'made', 'point', 'excising', 'well-known', 'mannerisms', 'performance', 'Cagney', 'presence', 'critical', 'film', '115-minute', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'tedious', 'However', 'presence', 'Montgomery', 'focus', 'decision', 'making', 'process', 'war', 'more', 'detail', 'other', 'film', 'mind', 'quot', 'Command', 'Decision', 'quot', 'would', 'be', 'running', 'one', 'beat', 'Clearly', 'can', 'do', 'talking', 'head', 'war', 'movie', 'when', 'main', 'talking', 'head', 'James', 'Cagney.The', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'duel', 'Halsey', 'Japanese', 'counterpart', 'Admiral', 'Yamamoto', 'James', 'T.', 'Goto', 'not', 'only', 'question', 'winning', 'battle', 'control', 'Guadacanal', 'personal', 'attempt', 'kill', 'other', 'Japanese', 'commander', 'portrayed', 'worthy', 'opponent', 'as', 'much', 'attention', 'aspects', 'work', 'Halsey', 'Biographical', 'details', 'abound', 'documentary', 'time', 'Halsey', 'somebody', 'voice', 'tells', 'not', 'only', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'guy', 'who', 'driving', 'jeep', 'hour', 'away', 'being', 'short', 'sniper', 'becoming', 'paraplegic', 'rest', 'life', 'squad', 'heads', 'out', 'Guadacanal', 'learn', 'only', 'three', 'are', 'coming', 'back', 'details', 'are', 'such', 'would', 'have', 'sworn', 'film', 'was', 'adapted', 'book', 'book', 'title', 'other', 'work', 'cited', 'source', 'story.The', 'screenplay', 'Frank', 'D.', 'Gilroy', 'Beirne', 'Lay', 'Jr.', 'Lay', 'was', 'co-author', 'quot', 'Twelve', ""O'Clock"", 'High', 'quot', 'interesting', 'film', 'version', 'classic', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'novel', 'scene', 'central', 'character', 'out', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'alone', 'office', 'living', 'out', 'battle', 'own', 'mind', 'case', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'moral', 'quot', 'Gallant', 'Hours', 'quot', 'be', 'Cagney', 'voice', 'end', 'quot', 'are', 'great', 'men', 'only', 'great', 'challenges', 'ordinary', 'men', 'are', 'forced', 'circumstances', 'meet.', 'quot', 'course', 'quot', 'Gallant', 'Hours', 'quot', 'pretty', 'much', 'disproves', 'point', 'least', 'regards', 'man', 'top', 'South', 'Pacific']",N/A
310828,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,6302413370,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","I liked a lot this good, solid American war film telling the story of one of principal US commanders during Pacific War - Admiral Halsey. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.The work on this ambitious film began in 1957, when many veterans of Guadalcanal campaign were still alive and well - and that included Halsey himself, who was extensively (and with greatest respect) consulted. In the beginning the purpose was to make a larger biographic study about this great but controversial man, but ultimately the producers decided to focus on what was certainly both his and the whole US Navy MOST GALLANT HOURS - the Guadalcanal campaign.It was decided on purpose to make the film black and white, as the public was used to see and recognize Halsey's unique face on old war time chronicles. James Cagney was selected to play Halsey in large part because of his somehow similar features but also because he was Hollywood's specialist of tough and rough guys - and real Halsey was certainly both... Sadly, Admiral Halsey died on 16 August 1959, before the film was ready - therefore this movie became indeed a homage - but a posthumous one...You will find here a brief reminder of his career, BEFORE Guadalcanal campaign (and therefore before the beginning of this film):---------Fleet Admiral William Frederick Halsey, Jr., GBE, was born on 30 October 1882 in the good town of Elizabeth, New Jersey. Following the traces of his father, a Captain in US Navy, he entered the US Naval Academy at Annapolis in 1900, graduated in 1904 and had a good, solid career on battleships, torpedo boats and destroyers (and a period of service as Naval Attach&eacute; in Berlin) for the next 30 years.In 1934, having reached the rank of Captain, he was offered the command of aircraft-carrier USS ""Saratoga"", at the condition of succeeding a training as air observer. Instead, Halsey volunteered for the pilots training and graduated successfully the same year, as the oldest person in US Navy ever to do it - at that time he was 52... This was also a major turning point in his career, as he would become with time the leading American commander of aircraft-carriers. Unlike many officers of his age Halsey immediately understood the importance of naval aviation and did everything he could to become the leading expert in this matter. His performance as commander of carriers was recognized by his promotions to Rear-Admiral in 1938 and Vice-Admiral in 1940.On 7 December 1941 Halsey was on board of his flagship USS ""Enterprise"", returning to Pearl Harbor after delivering planes to island of Wake. Seeing the destruction caused by Japanese raid, Halsey said those famous words ""Before we are through with them, the Japanese language will be spoken only in hell!""... Soon after, on 10 December 1941, planes from USS ""Enterprise"" symbolically ""opened the score"" by sinking large Kaidai-class submarine ""I-70"", the first Japanese warship destroyed by Americans during World War II.In the months following Pearl Harbor, Halsey took his aircraft carriers on numerous raids against Japanese positions in Pacific, following the instructions of Nimitz to NOT let the enemy have the monopoly on offensive operations. Those orders suited Halsey just fine, as his idea of warfare was to be always on the attack - he is famous for having said once ""As long as I have one plane and one pilot to fly it, I will remain on offensive"". Attacking relentlessly Japanese positions from January to May 1942 he put in practice his personal motto ""Hit hard, hit fast, hit often!"" and ""bloodied"" his until then unexperienced sailors and air-crews (the Japanese by comparison had already behind them four years of total war in China).Those months of frantic activity took their toll on 60-years old Halsey and in the middle of May 1942 his health deteriorated so badly that at one moment his vital prognostic became engaged. He was then mercilessly ordered to the hospital both by doctors and Nimitz, notwithstanding his extremely violent protestations. This was the reason why he was not present at the crucial battle of Midway - admirals Fletcher and Spruance commanded instead. To the end of his days Halsey considered missing Midway as the greatest disappointment of his whole life.Even after releasing him from hospital, US Navy doctors vetoed Halsey's return to active duty, asking that he completes a minimum of two month period of convalescence in July and August. During this time Nimitz launched on 7 August 1942 the operation ""Watchtower"", the first allied counter-offensive in the Pacific. The target was a territory covered with savage jungle and rotten swamps, dirt-poor, undevelopped, little known and considered until recently of having absolutely not importance - the island of Guadalcanal...Even if the initial landing and battles of Eastern Solomons and Cape Esperance soon after were successes, with time the campaign became an excruciating, nightmarish, and extremely bloody push-and-shove match and in the beginning of October 1942 American troops on Guadalcanal were fighting not so much for the conquest of the island but for their own SURVIVAL. Vice-Admiral Ghormley, commander of allied forces in South Pacific Area, admitted on 15 October that he may not be able to hold Guadalcanal and that the island may have to be evacuated. It was precisely at that moment, that Halsey, finally released back to active duty by doctors at the end of September, was travelling to the South Pacific to take command of US carriers operating in the area.Admiral Nimitz's reaction to Ghormley's analyse of the situation was immediate and radical - on the 18 October he relieved him from command and gave his post to Halsey, who just arrived to New Caledonia and was completely surprised to find out that he was now in charge of the whole South Pacific Area. Although you will not see it in this film, Halsey exclaimed himself after reading Nimitz orders """"Jesus Christ and General Jackson! This is the hottest potato they ever handed me!"". What made the situation even more awkward, was that Halsey and Ghormley were good friends...-----------------------It is AT THAT MOMENT, that ""Gallant hours"" begins - and I will not say much more about what follows, to avoid spoilers. One thing however - DO NOT expect any battle scenes. In this film, war is shown from the perspective of the commander in chief who is in charge of a whole large area, and not from the point of view of front line combatants. Four extremely dramatic and costly (for both sides) major naval battles (Santa Cruz, First Naval Guadalcanal, Second Naval Guadalcanal, Tassafaronga), as well as a great number of land and air fights (including the decisive battle of Lunga Point), will be waged before this film ends,- but they will be shown through dispatches and reports...James Cagney offers a GREAT performance here - he literally IS Admiral Halsey! There is however one difference: Halsey was loud, high spoken, potty-mouthed and very aggressive and especially wouldn't recognize diplomacy even if it sat on his nose - but in this film, by common agreement of Cagney and the director, he is shown as a slightly calmer and more subdued person.There are many good dialogs, many very tense, moving and tragic moments and yes, there even is some (very dark) war time humour - try particularly not to miss some of the writings US Marines places on their bunkers on Guadalcanal... This film also shows very well how Halsey's nomination immediately improved the morale amongst American sailors and Marines during this campaign (and they REALLY needed it as the decisive battles were approaching) and how his agressive style of waging war proved to be better adapted to the situation than the more cautious approach of his predecessor. I also particularly recommend the low-key, low-drama scene in which Halsey meets admirals Scott and Callaghan just before the First Naval Guadalcanal - this is a very special and moving moment...""Gallant hours"" sticks mostly to the real history, but there is ONE huge difference. In the film Guadalcanal campaign ends with death of Yamamoto - but the real Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, Japanese commander of Combined Fleet (all major surface warships of Imperial Navy) and therefore Halsey's top opponent since December 1941, met his fate in April 1943, two months AFTER Guadalcanal campaign ended. As far as I can say however the rest of events was described very faithfully to real history. In particular we never hear the stupid nickname ""Bull"" American press gave to Halsey, as he hated reading it in the newspapers and absolutely nobody ever dared to call him like that in his presence...Bottom line, this is a GREAT war film and a most excellent portrayal of a very talented and efficient (albeit controversial) soldier, who in his career went as far as it was possible - indeed Halsey retired with the rank of Fleet Admiral, the highest a man can reach in US Navy (only three others EVER reached it - Nimitz, Leahy and King).I will keep this DVD preciously for another viewing in the future.

310837,A2MJ2LPNNQ7LIP,6302413370,Phil Berardelli,"[0, 0]","This is a most unusual war movie, an almost reverential look at Admiral William F. Halsey, Jr. - complete with frequent (and mostly male) choral accompaniment in the background. Commander of U.S. Navy forces in the South Pacific during World War II, and of Colonel James Doolittle's daring raid on Tokyo, Halsey didn't get his nickname, ""Bull,"" for nothing. His stubborn refusal to retreat at the battle of Guadalcanal in the face of far superior Japanese forces became the stuff of legend, as was his daring and successful effort to shoot down an aircraft carrying Isoroku Yamamoto, the Japanese admiral who executed the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and who commanded the fleet that Halsey was charged with destroying. James Cagney's next-to-last starring role is a fine one, but it's also his most restrained, made all the more admirable by the limitations placed on his character. Except for a few exterior scenes, this could have been done as a stage play. There are no battle sequences, and most of the action, so to speak, takes place at Halsey's headquarters or in the stateroom aboard his flagship. So do the interactions among the Japanese commanders. A somber narrator provides much of the background detail, and some sequences consist entirely of Cagney alone with his thoughts in a room - such as a long sequence depicting Halsey waiting for word about the outcome of the infamous sea battle to save Guadalcanal - but he's so compelling you can't lose your interest in what's happening, or in him.

310839,A3HJAIFRRFHUAB,6302413370,"Phred ""Phred""","[2, 2]","There is something courageous about a 1960s era World War II movie without any battle scenes. The Gallant Hours focuses almost entirely on the character of Adm. William ""Bull"" Halsey in his newly appointed role as theater commander in the South Pacific. The selection of James Cagney for this role is somehow obvious. Cagney excelled in the role of the gruff leader and there was even some physical resemblance between the two. This is a good movie especially in that it honors one of America's great fighting leaders. Given what passed for a movie biopic in 1961 Warner Bros. and director Robert Montgomery can be forgiven its relative lack of depth or historic analysis.In just under two hours this movie will cover roughly 5 weeks of history as Adm. Halsey is ordered to relieve Adm. Gormley as theater commander in the South Pacific and assumes the particular tasks of first, protecting the marine invasion of Guadalcanal and second to successfully complete this campaign. At this point World War II for America had been underway for less than one year. Major victories had been won against the Japanese however what would become the American industrial juggernaut had not yet moved the material balance in favor of US Naval deployed forces. Consequently naval leadership was under enormous pressure to conserve major forces, specifically aircraft carriers and battleships. Neither leadership nor doctrine had fully caught up with the realities of war with the Japanese. This review, like this movie lacks the time to detailed this problem. I therefore recommend Pacific Crucible: War at Sea in the Pacific, 1941-1942, as one of several books that addresses these issues.This movie does an excellent job of focusing on the kinds of pressures and realities experienced by the real Adm. Halsey while giving some flavor of how popular he was in the fighting Navy.Narration supplies brief biographies of a variety of war's victims and survivors lending respect to the variety of people who serve in a world war.At some point deserved adulation of Adm. Halsey becomes cloying. Gallant Hours was never going to be an uncritical movie but the repetitive coral interruption sounds more like an effort to sanctify this very human, human. Note that the intended theme of the movie is a quote attributed to the admiral, that ""there are no great men..."".The actual climax of this movie is the dispatch of Adm.'s Norman Scott and Daniel Callahan. These officers would lead a line of cruisers with supporting destroyers against a Japanese bombardment group that included two battleships. Both of these admirals would be lost in this engagement. Adm. Callahan would posthumously receive the Medal of Honor. The subsequent loss of the severely damaged light cruiser Juneau would include the five Sullivan brothers in its casualty list. What was bought by this desperate night engagement would be the denial of the Japanese's intent to bombard the Marines and such severe damage to the Japanese flagship that it would be sunk by Guadalcanal aviators the next day. The movie makes clear the total isolation of Adm. Halsey from the physical experience of his decisions but not the emotional costs of waiting.The inclusion of the successful intercept and killing of his Japanese counterpart Adm. Yamamoto is intended to end the movie on a high note. This action was a legitimate intelligence achievement and a successful, dangerous mission by Army pilots. If you watch James Cagney closely his portrayal of the admiral in this moment, expresses the likely emotions of the real Adm. Halsey. He would have realized the limited significance of this mission and recognized that he carried the same target on his own back.This is a good movie in that it is a good character study of an American hero at a key point in America's history. James Cagney performs the role brilliantly. Given the time this movie was filmed its lack of depth is forgivable.  I would've liked to of seen a few more moments detailing why some of Halsey's decisions were so difficult and why so much honor is due to those who executed them.",4,"James Cagney as Adm.
