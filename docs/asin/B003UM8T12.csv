Petrucelli,"[16, 16]","We've always respected Harold Rowe Holbrook as an actor---witness Hal's 10 Emmy wins and one Oscar nod---but if there was ever even the teeniest quibble about just how good he is, we have three words: That Evening Sun. And please don't confuse this Imagine Entertainment release with Evening Shade, the TV '90s seires in which Hal co-starred with Burt Reynolds and Marilu Henner.The film, just out on DVD and Blu-ray, tells a simple and strong story.A man-strong, resolute-will not let his life disappear into the twilight. He will not let it vanish over the horizon. Instead, he will fight . . .to keep the things he loves, to confront the petty emotional robberies inflicted on the elderly. That Evening Sun is a tale of determination and hope played against the humid background of Southern gothic emotions. It got rave reviews---Variety hailed Hal's performance as a ""career-highlight star turn as an irascible octogenarian farmer who will not go gentle into that good night.""And on a touching, bittersweet postscript, the film marks the last screen appearance of Dixie Carter, Holbrook's real life wife, who died shortly after the film was made . . . and to whom the film is dedicated.Holbrook plays Abner Meecham, an aging Tennessee farmer living in a nursing facility where he has been placed by his son, Paul, who has no sympathy for a father's pride. But Abner has other ideas . . . and escapes to fulfill his dream of returning to his cherished farm and living out his final days in peace.But when he arrives, he finds that his son has betrayed him a second time.Paul has sold the lease of the farm to Abner's old adversary, Lonzo Choat. With the battle lines drawn, neither man is willing to give way. Threats are made, events spiral out of control and a startling climax is inevitable.Based on I Hate To See That Evening Sun Go Down, a celebrated anthology of short stories from William Gay, and fraught with passion and courage played out against life's departing light, That Evening Sun is a portrait of a man who is not only intent on reclaiming his land, but his own life as well.Get out the tissues.",5,Hal Holbrook Shines Brightly in Evening Sun,1285027200,"09 21, 2010",2010,2116,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'respected', 'Harold', 'Rowe', 'Holbrook', 'actor', '-witness', 'Hal', '10', 'Emmy', 'wins', 'one', 'Oscar', 'nod', '-but', 'was', 'ever', 'even', 'teeniest', 'quibble', 'about', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'have', 'three', 'words', 'Evening', 'Sun', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'confuse', 'Imagine', 'Entertainment', 'release', 'Evening', 'Shade', 'TV', 'seires', 'Hal', 'co-starred', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'Marilu', 'Henner.The', 'film', 'just', 'out', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'simple', 'strong', 'story.A', 'man-strong', 'resolute-will', 'not', 'let', 'life', 'disappear', 'twilight', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'vanish', 'horizon', 'Instead', 'will', 'fight', '.to', 'keep', 'things', 'confront', 'petty', 'emotional', 'robberies', 'inflicted', 'elderly', 'Evening', 'Sun', 'tale', 'determination', 'hope', 'played', 'humid', 'background', 'Southern', 'gothic', 'emotions', 'got', 'rave', 'reviews', '-Variety', 'hailed', 'Hal', 'performance', 'career-highlight', 'star', 'turn', 'irascible', 'octogenarian', 'farmer', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'gentle', 'good', 'night', 'touching', 'bittersweet', 'postscript', 'film', 'last', 'screen', 'appearance', 'Dixie', 'Carter', 'Holbrook', 'real', 'life', 'wife', 'who', 'died', 'shortly', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'whom', 'film', 'dedicated.Holbrook', 'plays', 'Abner', 'Meecham', 'aging', 'Tennessee', 'farmer', 'living', 'nursing', 'facility', 'where', 'been', 'placed', 'son', 'Paul', 'who', 'sympathy', 'father', 'pride', 'Abner', 'other', 'ideas', 'fulfill', 'dream', 'returning', 'cherished', 'farm', 'living', 'out', 'final', 'days', 'peace.But', 'when', 'son', 'betrayed', 'second', 'time.Paul', 'sold', 'lease', 'farm', 'Abner', 'old', 'adversary', 'Lonzo', 'Choat', 'battle', 'lines', 'drawn', 'man', 'willing', 'give', 'way', 'Threats', 'are', 'made', 'events', 'spiral', 'control', 'startling', 'climax', 'inevitable.Based', 'Hate', 'See', 'Evening', 'Sun', 'Go', 'Down', 'celebrated', 'anthology', 'short', 'stories', 'William', 'Gay', 'fraught', 'passion', 'courage', 'played', 'out', 'life', 'departing', 'light', 'Evening', 'Sun', 'portrait', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'intent', 'reclaiming', 'land', 'own', 'life', 'well.Get', 'tissues']",That Evening Sun

This level is shared by every main character in the movie & is very impactful.

1366354,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003UM8T12,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","At the end of the day, I'm quite surprised that ""That Evening Sun"" didn't get a bit more attention upon its release than it did.  Why?  Simply put, it has an absolutely extraordinary performance by the great Hal Holbrook that deserves to be seen and appreciated.  Holbrook has been relegated to supporting roles of late, but it's nice to see him front and center again.  In this film, he commands attention with every moment of screen time (and he's in practically every scene!).  It's hard for me to imagine that if Robert Duvall (or someone of that ilk) had given exactly the same performance that it wouldn't have been talked about for an Oscar nomination.  That's, seriously, how impressed I was with Holbrook's strength and star quality.Holbrook plays a retiree who escapes from the confines of a nursing home to journey back to his family farm.  Upon arriving there, however, he discovers that his son (Walton Goggins) has leased the house to a struggling family with a troubled past.  Irascible and unlikable, the cantankerous Holbrook is instantly antagonistic to his farm's new inhabitants.  Taking up squatter's rights in the property's tenant cabin--Holbrook settles in until a more favorable resolution is forthcoming.  As he begins to witness some unsavory moments within the family, he starts to confront some of his own past demons and the life he's led.  Helping the family might just be a form of redemption--but extending help when help isn't asked for may not always be a prudent action.  Tensions escalate continuously until something has to give.I wished the film had not taken the easy route in making the new homeowner an outright villain.  At first, he seemed pretty reasonable--heck, he let Holbrook stay when he had every right to have the police escort him from the property.  In fact, this becomes more of a sticking point the further the film progresses.  The story would have ended had they removed Holbrook legally.  But the film is still a dramatically successful character study of a man hanging on to independence and dignity while reconciling life's bad decisions and regrets.  And it is Holbrook's best work in years--perhaps even a career high point.  Not a perfect film, ""That Evening Sun"" still has power and heart--and I think that over the years, it's a sleeper people will discover and love!

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[16, 16]","THAT EVENING SUN is one of those marvelous ""little"" pictures that usually gets lost in the shuffle because it's too little.  On the other hand, if one is lucky enough to catch it, the film stays with them forever.Hal Holbrook, in what is perhaps the finest performance of his stellar career, plays Abner Meecham, a crusty old coot who escapes from his retirement home and returns to his farm, only to discover that his adult son (Walton Goggins) has ""sold"" it to a family that the octogenarian considers to be `white trash"".Meecham, however, is a proud, stubborn man, so he moves into the sharecropper's cabin across from the main house, buys a barking dog for company and lays ""siege"" to the intruders.  It is just a matter of time before events turn very ugly.Adapted to the screen by director Scott Teems from a short story by William Gay, THAT EVENING SUN is filled with well-defined characters of varying shades of gray.

1366361,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B003UM8T12,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","Based on the short story ""I Hate to See That Evening Sun Go Down"" by William Gay, ""That Evening Sun"" presents us with an epic battle of wills between two equally immutable forces fighting over the same piece of land.  The property in question is a rundown farm in rural Tennessee owned by Abner Meecham (Hal Holbrooke), an octogenarian who's just walked away from the retirement home his son (Walter Goggins) placed him in after a serious fall a few months back.  When Abner gets back to his farm, he is stunned to find that - thanks to a deal brokered by his lawyer son - the place has been signed over to a white-trash, ne'er-do-well by the name of Lonzo Choat (Ray McKinnon), who now lives there with his wife (Carrie Preston) and sixteen-year-old daughter (Mia Wasikowska), with whom Abner establishes an uneasy but generally tender relationship.Scott Teem's screenplay is multi-faceted and complex in the way it develops its characters.  For instance, many of the very same qualities that make Abner so appealing to the audience - his tenacity, his commitment to principle, his uncompromising willingness to call things as he sees them - are also what make him a hard person to deal with for those who are actually a part of his life.  This is especially the case with his son, who though he obviously loves his father and wants to do right by him, harbors a lifelong resentment against the old man for his harsh treatment of both himself and his now-deceased mother while he was growing up.To a somewhat lesser extent, Lonzo is also portrayed in a three-dimensional light.  Though he is an alcoholic, a wastrel, and a man prone to acts of violence against both animals and members of his own family, there is a sense that he is genuinely trying to get his life together by earning an honest living and finally being a decent provider for his loved ones.The movie really seems to understand the tragedy of old age - of feeling as if everything you ever called your own is now being taken away from you and nobody around you seems to care.  In fact, many of those people - despite, in some cases, their possible good intentions - are proactively involved in bringing that outcome about.  The movie also touches upon that root and highly American value of property ownership, and the willingness to stop at virtually nothing to ensure one's hold on one's land.""That Evening Sun"" is what is called in the trade an ""actors' picture,"" and, indeed, it is the performances that are of primary interest here.  Holbrooke has always been a tremendous actor, but here he is positively transcendent as Abner, a crusty old coot who is so much more than just a crusty old coot.  Goggins, the brilliant star of ""The Shield"" and ""Justified"" and a co-producer of this film, is also excellent as Paul Meecham, a role quite different from the ones in the aforementioned works.  And McKinnon, Preston (""True Blood""), and Wasikowska (""Alice in Wonderland,"" ""The Kids are All Right"") are all wonderful as well.The tone of the film is contemplative and muted, and Teems' direction is rich in atmosphere and setting.",4,Beautifully measured performance by the great Hal Holbrooke,1311811200,"07 28, 2011",2011,3097,"['Based', 'short', 'story', 'Hate', 'See', 'Evening', 'Sun', 'Go', 'Down', 'William', 'Gay', 'Evening', 'Sun', 'epic', 'battle', 'wills', 'two', 'equally', 'immutable', 'forces', 'fighting', 'same', 'piece', 'land', 'property', 'question', 'rundown', 'farm', 'rural', 'Tennessee', 'owned', 'Abner', 'Meecham', 'Hal', 'Holbrooke', 'octogenarian', 'who', 'just', 'walked', 'away', 'retirement', 'home', 'son', 'Walter', 'Goggins', 'placed', 'serious', 'fall', 'few', 'months', 'back', 'When', 'Abner', 'back', 'farm', 'stunned', 'find', 'thanks', 'deal', 'brokered', 'lawyer', 'son', 'place', 'been', 'signed', 'white-trash', ""ne'er-do-well"", 'name', 'Lonzo', 'Choat', 'Ray', 'McKinnon', 'who', 'now', 'wife', 'Carrie', 'Preston', 'sixteen-year-old', 'daughter', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'whom', 'Abner', 'uneasy', 'generally', 'tender', 'relationship.Scott', 'Teem', 'screenplay', 'multi-faceted', 'complex', 'way', 'characters', 'instance', 'many', 'very', 'same', 'qualities', 'make', 'Abner', 'so', 'appealing', 'audience', 'tenacity', 'commitment', 'principle', 'uncompromising', 'willingness', 'call', 'things', 'are', 'also', 'what', 'make', 'hard', 'person', 'deal', 'who', 'are', 'actually', 'part', 'life', 'especially', 'case', 'son', 'who', 'obviously', 'father', 'do', 'right', 'lifelong', 'resentment', 'old', 'man', 'harsh', 'treatment', 'now-deceased', 'mother', 'was', 'growing', 'up.To', 'somewhat', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Lonzo', 'also', 'portrayed', 'three-dimensional', 'light', 'alcoholic', 'wastrel', 'man', 'prone', 'acts', 'violence', 'animals', 'members', 'own', 'family', 'sense', 'genuinely', 'trying', 'get', 'life', 'together', 'earning', 'honest', 'living', 'finally', 'being', 'decent', 'provider', 'loved', 'ones.The', 'movie', 'really', 'understand', 'tragedy', 'old', 'age', 'feeling', 'everything', 'ever', 'called', 'own', 'now', 'being', 'taken', 'away', 'nobody', 'care', 'fact', 'many', 'people', 'cases', 'possible', 'good', 'intentions', 'are', 'proactively', 'involved', 'bringing', 'outcome', 'movie', 'also', 'root', 'highly', 'American', 'value', 'property', 'ownership', 'willingness', 'stop', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'ensure', 'one', 'hold', 'one', 'land', 'Evening', 'Sun', 'what', 'called', 'trade', 'actors', 'picture', 'indeed', 'performances', 'are', 'primary', 'interest', 'here', 'Holbrooke', 'always', 'been', 'tremendous', 'actor', 'here', 'positively', 'transcendent', 'Abner', 'crusty', 'old', 'coot', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'crusty', 'old', 'coot', 'Goggins', 'brilliant', 'star', 'Shield', 'Justified', 'co-producer', 'film', 'also', 'excellent', 'Paul', 'Meecham', 'role', 'quite', 'different', 'ones', 'aforementioned', 'works', 'McKinnon', 'Preston', 'True', 'Blood', 'Wasikowska', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'Kids', 'are', 'Right', 'are', 'wonderful', 'well.The', 'tone', 'film', 'contemplative', 'muted', 'Teems', 'direction', 'rich', 'atmosphere', 'setting']",That Evening Sun
1366362,ARXYVR1TPTY6P,B003UM8T12,"TJ-STL ""DVD viewer""","[1, 1]","Reading others review I will just clarify or explain some misleading details.1) The son and wife were apparently treaded bad by the old man ""Ryan Reynolds"" all during his marriage and raising his son.2) The son was loveingly justified puting the old man in a ""healthcare center"" because of serious injuries after a fall which was the second time he almost died. So that should have been fair3) Nobody but the neighbor and ""trashy girl"" are likeable and they have minor parts4) The ""evil"" renter could not throw him off the ranch since he was only renting and apparently since he had no job would never be able to own the farm.5) The old man was so cantankerous to everyone, including his his son & wife, but did briefly feel bad he would not wait for her to stop trying on a dress to go out AND SHE DIED when he returned.6) The son tried to convince the old man that in 2 or 3 weeks he could have his nemesis removed and move back onto the farm.7) Why the old man never told the law or his son that the renter killed his dog and hung him on the porch would have removed the threat to ""put him away"" for being crazy, so the story teller let his son that the law think he was nuts8) The girl offered to not run away and help him fix up the shack and he turned that down and would not even leave with her.9) The old man ""apparently-since the ending is totally unfinished"" set up an apparent attempted murder charge sending the unlikeable unemployed renter to jail. Even thought he saved the old man when he suffered a stroke while setting up the burned up cabin hoax.10) This was a great short story made into a great movie but with all the loose ends and non-ending it hurt this 5 star movie to be a 3 or 4 star for me. And to my mind, the old man was more evil than the struggling down trodden failure of a man renter.  He might have matured if the Old man had left him alone.
