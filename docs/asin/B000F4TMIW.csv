However, Chaplin is the ultimate Hollywood actor when it comes to making pictures. Hell, he even built his own studio and started the Untied Artist Picture company. People don't realize how much Chaplin has contributed to the motion picture industry. Plus, he did most of all this without even speaking one word because only five of his films were talkies.The Mutual Comedies is a great set. While I do not know everything about Chaplin, I did learn a great deal about him with The Gentleman Tramp with is included on this set. These are great comedies that are nearly 100 years old and still make you laugh to this day.While Chaplin dvds can come from various places, the usual good dvds are out of print and very expensive.

983215,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000F4TMIW,calvinnme,"[4, 4]","This set consists of all twelve of the two reel films Charles Chaplin made for the Mutual Film Company in 1916 and 1917, and is a good place to start for people who are curious about the early work of Charles Chaplin. His early films, such as ""The Floorwalker"" and ""The Fireman"" have more of the crude slapstick style of humor present in Chaplin's Essanay and Keystone comedies. However, as the series progresses, you can clearly see Chaplin's evolution as a filmmaker. ""The Vagabond"" seems to presage ""The Kid"" in its melodramatic style, and ""One AM"" shows Chaplin do a rare solo act in which he plays a drunk man returning home from a bar at closing time and using just about every piece of furniture in his home as a comic prop as the house itself becomes his nemesis. He begins to become a much better storyteller as well as a good comedian, and the entries from the end of the series, such as ""The Immigrant"" and ""The Cure"" are considered among his best work and are quite cleverly done. As the other reviewers have said, this set is very high quality in regards to the video. This is not one of those cheap Chaplin sets that you can pick up for less than twenty dollars that are barely watchable. In addition to the twelve comedies on the first two discs are two documentaries on the final two discs. The first documentary, ""The Gentleman Tramp"", is a very well done 1975 biography of Chaplin's life including plenty of clips of home movies of his later life as well as clips from his shorts and features. The final disc is a documentary about Eric Campbell (1880-1917), the large man who is Chaplin's foil throughout the Mutual series of films.",5,The evolution of Chaplin as a filmmaker,1196380800,"11 30, 2007",2007,1651,"['set', 'twelve', 'two', 'reel', 'films', 'Charles', 'Chaplin', 'made', 'Mutual', 'Film', 'Company', '1916', '1917', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'curious', 'early', 'work', 'Charles', 'Chaplin', 'early', 'films', 'such', 'Floorwalker', 'Fireman', 'have', 'more', 'crude', 'slapstick', 'style', 'humor', 'present', 'Chaplin', 'Essanay', 'Keystone', 'comedies', 'However', 'series', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'Chaplin', 'evolution', 'filmmaker', 'Vagabond', 'presage', 'Kid', 'melodramatic', 'style', 'One', 'AM', 'Chaplin', 'do', 'rare', 'solo', 'act', 'drunk', 'man', 'returning', 'home', 'bar', 'closing', 'time', 'using', 'just', 'piece', 'furniture', 'home', 'comic', 'prop', 'house', 'nemesis', 'become', 'much', 'better', 'storyteller', 'as', 'well', 'good', 'comedian', 'entries', 'end', 'series', 'such', 'Immigrant', 'Cure', 'are', 'considered', 'best', 'work', 'are', 'quite', 'cleverly', 'done', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'set', 'very', 'high', 'quality', 'regards', 'video', 'not', 'one', 'cheap', 'Chaplin', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'less', 'twenty', 'dollars', 'are', 'barely', 'watchable', 'addition', 'twelve', 'comedies', 'first', 'two', 'discs', 'are', 'two', 'documentaries', 'final', 'two', 'discs', 'first', 'documentary', 'Gentleman', 'Tramp', 'very', 'well', 'done', '1975', 'biography', 'Chaplin', 'life', 'including', 'plenty', 'clips', 'home', 'movies', 'later', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'clips', 'shorts', 'features', 'final', 'disc', 'documentary', 'Eric', 'Campbell', '1880-1917', 'large', 'man', 'who', 'Chaplin', 'foil', 'Mutual', 'series', 'films']",N/A
983216,A3M5UGU0NGD38D,B000F4TMIW,Casey62,"[3, 4]","It truly is a joy to see Charlie Chaplin's Mutual two reel comedies fully restored and accompanied with fresh music scores by veteran silent film composer Carl Davis. While there's no doubting that Chaplin's feature length films are cinematic masterworks, these twelve gems from 1916-1917 are perhaps more representative of the wide range of this comic genius.In addition to the direct, up front comedy sequences, there are subtle bits of business that Chaplin constantly does in front of the camera so that your eyes never leave the screen. His pantomime is so descriptive of the narrative action that title cards are unnecessary. These shorts not only inspired much of Chaplin's own later feature work, but many of the gags he originated in the Mutuals show up - with or without improvisation - in the films of other comedy greats like Laurel and Hardy and The Three Stooges.When watching this quintessential collection it becomes apparent just how skillful Chaplin was at anything he attempted. For example, he was a master at controlling his body, whether he's balancing on a precariously tipping ladder as in THE PAWNSHOP, or doing antics while rollerskating as in THE RINK. He makes it all look simple and spontaneous when in fact it took hours of meticulous planning and practice.But Chaplin's talent transcends physical comedy and slapstick; he was equally adept at conveying pathos and irony through his art in a romantic way that's both universal and timeless. These qualities are at the core of EASY STREET, THE IMMIGRANT, and THE VAGABOND.While Chaplin's films may not always cause you to slap your knee and roar with laughter, they offer something else also that's more profound. They put a sustained smile on your face, bring an occasional tear to your eye, and leave lingering images of visual poetry in your memory long after you've seen them.My highest recommendation.",5,AFTER NEARLY A CENTURY THE LITTLE TRAMP IS STILL A CLASS ACT,1287964800,"10 25, 2010",2010,1885,"['truly', 'joy', 'see', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'Mutual', 'two', 'reel', 'comedies', 'fully', 'restored', 'accompanied', 'fresh', 'music', 'scores', 'veteran', 'silent', 'film', 'composer', 'Carl', 'Davis', 'doubting', 'Chaplin', 'feature', 'length', 'films', 'are', 'cinematic', 'masterworks', 'twelve', 'gems', '1916-1917', 'are', 'perhaps', 'more', 'representative', 'wide', 'range', 'comic', 'genius.In', 'addition', 'direct', 'up', 'front', 'comedy', 'sequences', 'are', 'subtle', 'bits', 'business', 'Chaplin', 'constantly', 'front', 'camera', 'eyes', 'never', 'leave', 'screen', 'pantomime', 'so', 'descriptive', 'narrative', 'action', 'title', 'cards', 'are', 'unnecessary', 'shorts', 'not', 'only', 'inspired', 'much', 'Chaplin', 'own', 'later', 'feature', 'work', 'many', 'gags', 'originated', 'Mutuals', 'show', 'up', 'improvisation', 'films', 'other', 'comedy', 'greats', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'Three', 'Stooges.When', 'watching', 'quintessential', 'collection', 'apparent', 'just', 'how', 'skillful', 'Chaplin', 'was', 'anything', 'attempted', 'example', 'was', 'master', 'controlling', 'body', 'balancing', 'precariously', 'tipping', 'ladder', 'THE', 'PAWNSHOP', 'doing', 'antics', 'rollerskating', 'THE', 'RINK', 'look', 'simple', 'spontaneous', 'when', 'fact', 'took', 'hours', 'meticulous', 'planning', 'practice.But', 'Chaplin', 'talent', 'physical', 'comedy', 'slapstick', 'was', 'equally', 'adept', 'conveying', 'pathos', 'irony', 'art', 'romantic', 'way', 'universal', 'timeless', 'qualities', 'are', 'core', 'EASY', 'STREET', 'THE', 'IMMIGRANT', 'THE', 'VAGABOND.While', 'Chaplin', 'films', 'may', 'not', 'always', 'cause', 'slap', 'knee', 'roar', 'laughter', 'offer', 'something', 'else', 'also', 'more', 'profound', 'put', 'sustained', 'smile', 'face', 'bring', 'occasional', 'tear', 'eye', 'leave', 'lingering', 'images', 'visual', 'poetry', 'memory', 'long', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'them.My', 'highest', 'recommendation']",N/A

983218,A252GNMB3PIZA8,B000F4TMIW,Eric Perlin,"[1, 1]","This set of DVDs contains all 12 short films Charlie Chaplin made for Mutual Studios between 1916 and 1917. He performed in, wrote, directed and edited all of them, and he put tons of hard work into every aspect of them to make each one as great as it could possibly be. Chaplin was known to do hundreds of takes to get a scene just right, and he would stay awake all night to edit his films, meticulously picking out the best takes of each scene.11 of the 12 shorts Chaplin made for Mutual Studios in 1916 and 1917 were comedies, and great comedies. In fact, they're still fresh and hilarious almost 100 years later! The picture quality is not perfect, but still remarkably sharp and clear considering the age of these films. Many films made by other actors during this era have since deteriorated to the point of being irretrievably lost. Thank goodness Chaplin's works have not only survived, but were in good enough condition to be digitally restored to a reasonably close semblance of how they must have looked in theaters when originally released.One film in this set that I would consider more of a drama than a comedy is &#34;The Vagabond&#34;. It's not bad, but it's not really a comedy like the other films. &#34;The Immigrant&#34; and &#34;Easy Street&#34; have a some moments of effective melodrama, but for the most part these are very funny comedies, just like the rest of Chaplin's films from this period. If I were to describe all the comedy highlights from the 12 films in this set, this review would wind up being book length. So, just watch these films and find all the great comedy scenes yourself.Each film runs about 25 minutes. They seem to be projected at a speed that's faster than real life, but maybe that's how Chaplin intended them to be seen. (There was no true &#34;correct speed&#34; for films of this era, as both cameras and projectors were hand-cranked.)Proper, fitting music scores are very important in silent cinema, so it's good that all 12 films have excellent music scores composed and conducted by Carl Davis especially for these films. (Cheap public domain releases of silent films are often undermined by randomly-selected music tracks that have no connection to the action on the films they're accompanying.)This is a 4-disc set. The 12 Chaplin short films are on the first two discs. They're all in consecutive order, and each film is preceded by a brief introduction with some interesting information about the making of the film. There are two additional discs of bonus material. Disc 3 has a first-rate feature-length documentary about the life of Charlie Chaplin from 1975 called &#34;The Gentleman Tramp&#34;, narrated by Walter Matthau. The disc includes two slightly different versions of the same film. Disc 4 is a documentary called &#34;Chaplin's Goliath&#34;, about Eric Campbell, a recurring villain and co-star in Chaplin's Mutual films.You could waste your money on cheaper versions of Chaplin's Mutual films with missing footage, muddy picture quality, cropped sides and ill-fitting music tracks, but if you want to actually see these classic comedies as Chaplin intended, and actually ENJOY them, spend just a little bit more and buy this authorized box set from Image Entertainment.",5,"11 Comedies, One Drama, and Two Documentaries",1394323200,"03 9, 2014",2014,3245,"['set', 'DVDs', '12', 'short', 'films', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'made', 'Mutual', 'Studios', '1916', '1917', 'performed', 'wrote', 'directed', 'edited', 'put', 'tons', 'hard', 'work', 'aspect', 'make', 'one', 'as', 'great', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'Chaplin', 'was', 'known', 'do', 'hundreds', 'get', 'scene', 'just', 'right', 'would', 'stay', 'awake', 'night', 'edit', 'films', 'meticulously', 'picking', 'out', 'best', 'scene.11', '12', 'shorts', 'Chaplin', 'made', 'Mutual', 'Studios', '1916', '1917', 'were', 'comedies', 'great', 'comedies', 'fact', ""'re"", 'still', 'fresh', 'hilarious', 'almost', '100', 'years', 'later', 'picture', 'quality', 'not', 'perfect', 'still', 'remarkably', 'sharp', 'clear', 'considering', 'age', 'films', 'Many', 'films', 'made', 'other', 'actors', 'era', 'have', 'deteriorated', 'point', 'being', 'irretrievably', 'lost', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'Chaplin', 'works', 'have', 'not', 'only', 'survived', 'were', 'good', 'enough', 'condition', 'be', 'digitally', 'restored', 'reasonably', 'close', 'semblance', 'how', 'must', 'have', 'looked', 'theaters', 'when', 'originally', 'released.One', 'film', 'set', 'would', 'consider', 'more', 'drama', 'comedy', '34', 'Vagabond', '34', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'really', 'comedy', 'other', 'films', '34', 'Immigrant', '34', '34', 'Easy', 'Street', '34', 'have', 'moments', 'effective', 'melodrama', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'comedies', 'just', 'rest', 'Chaplin', 'films', 'period', 'were', 'describe', 'comedy', 'highlights', '12', 'films', 'set', 'review', 'would', 'wind', 'up', 'being', 'book', 'length', 'So', 'just', 'watch', 'films', 'find', 'great', 'comedy', 'scenes', 'yourself.Each', 'film', 'runs', '25', 'minutes', 'seem', 'be', 'projected', 'speed', 'faster', 'real', 'life', 'maybe', 'how', 'Chaplin', 'intended', 'be', 'seen', 'was', 'true', '34', 'correct', 'speed', '34', 'films', 'era', 'cameras', 'projectors', 'were', 'hand-cranked', 'Proper', 'fitting', 'music', 'scores', 'are', 'very', 'important', 'silent', 'cinema', 'good', '12', 'films', 'have', 'excellent', 'music', 'scores', 'composed', 'conducted', 'Carl', 'Davis', 'especially', 'films', 'Cheap', 'public', 'domain', 'releases', 'silent', 'films', 'are', 'often', 'undermined', 'randomly-selected', 'music', 'tracks', 'have', 'connection', 'action', 'films', ""'re"", 'accompanying', '4-disc', 'set', '12', 'Chaplin', 'short', 'films', 'are', 'first', 'two', 'discs', ""'re"", 'consecutive', 'order', 'film', 'preceded', 'brief', 'introduction', 'interesting', 'information', 'making', 'film', 'are', 'two', 'additional', 'discs', 'bonus', 'material', 'Disc', '3', 'first-rate', 'feature-length', 'documentary', 'life', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', '1975', 'called', '34', 'Gentleman', 'Tramp', '34', 'narrated', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'disc', 'two', 'slightly', 'different', 'versions', 'same', 'film', 'Disc', '4', 'documentary', 'called', '34', 'Chaplin', 'Goliath', '34', 'Eric', 'Campbell', 'recurring', 'villain', 'co-star', 'Chaplin', 'Mutual', 'films.You', 'could', 'waste', 'money', 'cheaper', 'versions', 'Chaplin', 'Mutual', 'films', 'missing', 'footage', 'muddy', 'picture', 'quality', 'cropped', 'sides', 'ill-fitting', 'music', 'tracks', 'want', 'actually', 'see', 'classic', 'comedies', 'Chaplin', 'intended', 'actually', 'ENJOY', 'spend', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'buy', 'authorized', 'box', 'set', 'Image', 'Entertainment']",N/A
983219,A39118UAI0A4OI,B000F4TMIW,frankebe,"[7, 13]","Mostly fabulous prints, almost amazingly restored (some exceptions), with engaging if at times rather effete music.  Why only 3 stars?  Because this should be a two-disk release at half the cost, because of some unnecessarily over-exposed film, AND because in ""The Vagabond"" the sound is out of sync with the image (more details below).  I was not impressed with either documentary and could easily do without them: the Chaplin docu spends way too much time on Chaplin's wives instead of analyzing his film work, and shows too many bits of his films without comment; the Campbell documentary takes WAY too long to get going, and overall is slow and long and rather dull.About the restoration: I do have to agree with the other reviewer that some of the crud still on certain frames could be removed for a more comfortable viewing experience, and I hope that someone someday does a final ""restoration"" (all you need is FinalCut Express).  ALSO, the last third of ""The Vagabond"" is way over-exposed.  There are other prints available that are not overexposed.A bit more about the music:  It is mostly very good, and works best with the more sensitive films ""The Vagabond"" and ""The Immigrant"", although ""The Floorwalker"" and ""The Fireman"" also work very well.  Because of the cartoonish nature of these kick-ass little farces, there is much to be said for a more cartoonish style of music that is more of-the-times.  Sometimes a funny musical noise can help you to see a small action that you will otherwise miss (even at their best restoration, these movies are still a little hard to see).  Therefore, as a supplement to this set, I recommend you also purchase the Mutuals with their 1930s soundtracks.  These early soundtracks are often crude and even off-sync here and there, but they are also often hilarious, and the music extends the ridiculousness of the comedy.  These soundtracks work best with the silliest movies, of course.  So if you own both sets of these films--the Van Beuren AND the Shepard--you have options...In my opinion, Chaplin never made a funnier movie than ""The Pawnshop"".  I think it is his masterpiece among all his shorts.  As good as  Carl Davis is with the sound for this film (and he is VERY good), I always miss the precision of the musical moods and the over-the-top sound effects that the Van Beuren company (a cartoon studio) put to these films in 1931 and 1932.  Their music and effects to ""The Pawnshop"" is probably their own ""masterpiece"" of soundtracking.  (Also their version of ""The Count"" is far superior to Carl Davis' music, which at times does not fit AT ALL to the action.)Whereas the available prints of the Van Beuren versions are sometimes very poor, thankfully their particular print  of ""The Pawnshop"" is quite good--even including an important few frames of Chaplin konking himself on the head with a mallet, which is MISSING in the David Shepard version.Regarding sound for ""The Vagabond"": Carl Davis' music to this film is almost a model of how it should be done.  Alas, the sound is NOT IN SYNC with the movie.  It is about a second LATE.

I must say that while the last DVD restoration was great, this one keeps that same excellent film transfer, but adds more missing footage & title/dialogue cards from newly discovered prints.ONE AM has the biggest improvement with a total of over 7 minutes of additional footage, I was not able to do a side-by-side comparison but there were scenes I did not remember.  I do not want to spoil the comedy surprises of new footage here, you will have to enjoy it yourself.Other shorts such as THE RINK included new comedy bits and title / dialogue cards that helped the flow & understanding of the story.The bottom line is that this restoration does not improve on the already sharper picture quality of the previous release, but it does add missing footage not seen in the U.S. since the films' original releases.***UPDATE 7/20:***I have now had a chance to do a syncronized side-by-side comparison. While all of the other shorts are restored as mentioned above, adding new footage to the existing transfer, ONE AM is a totally new transfer.My reaction to this new transfer is mixed.  The big plus is a total of 7 minutes of new material added through out the short!  In addition, the old transfer was from a print that was matted on the sides to add a soundtrack, causing a tall & thin picture.  This new transfer restores the original square framed picture, adding to the sides of the picture.  The negative side to this new transfer is that the complete full frame print is from a negative that is a couple more generations away from the original camera negative. This is most noticable in the opening (and longer) taxi scene. Picture details in the taxi are lost in the blacks, where the older transfer shows some vehicle details.In a conversation I had with David, he said that trying to add the new footage to the existing footage on this title was too jarring, plus the sides of the picture were missing on the old transfer.  The decision was made to go with the complete print for the whole transfer.  It should be noted that the bulk of the short that takes place inside the house does not look bad and the benefits of the added picture to the sides are a big plus in keeping the new transfer.David also stated that he was working on restoring Chaplin's Keystone comedies! If it is a David Shepard project, it is well worth getting.***2011 UPDATE***The Keystone set is now available!Chaplin At Keystone: An International Collaboration of 34 Original Films***2013 UPDATE***David Shepard has found some new material and a new release (including Blu-ray) will be coming in late 2014.

983223,A2OAKHL0E0A4YQ,B000F4TMIW,"Robert G. Martinez ""Doctor of Rock""","[8, 8]","It has been 90 years since these great comedies were made (1916-17) and many folks that are new to Chaplin may dismiss them as funny shorts. Chaplin by 1916 was a real big star and was paid $650,000 to do these 12 comedies in a little over a year. A ridiculous sum in 1916. Unlike his full feature films from the 20's and 30's (with the exception of City Lights - a masterpiece)) where there was much emphasis on pathos,and tearjerking scenes, these comedies are wild and wacky. In 1970, I bought some of these on 8mm films thru Blackhawk Films and the quality was OK, but these prints are a revelation. The Mutual Comedies are the height of Chaplin's art. Each film features a theme: The Pawnbroker, The Rink, The Vagabond, Easy Street etc. and they are all hilarious. The Mutuals had a cast of stock actors that too were outstanding including his 300-pound bully Eric Campbell, Edna Purveyance, his love interest, Albert Austin, Henry Bergman and others. THIS IS THE FINEST QUALITY EVER SEEN ON THESE MOVIES! There are Documentaries galore which are also very interesting. Without dialogue, Chaplin could make you laugh just with his eyes or an expression, or his walk. People forget that he revolutionized motion pictures by bringing movies even to the smallest of towns. People all over the world loved Chaplin.

Rivers,"[13, 15]","When Charlie Chaplin signed with the Mutual Film Company in 1916, he  became the highest-paid performer at that time (with an annual salary of $670,000) and produced a dozen two-reelers that served as a blueprint for the rest of his career. The Mutuals captured the essence of Chaplin's serio-comic brilliance while revealing an artist at his creative peak. A stronger sense of ensemble was evident in the menacing presence of Eric Campbell, who became regarded as the ideal Chaplin heavy. ""Easy Street"" and ""The Immigrant"" (both 1917) represent the comedian's first masterpieces - incorporating social criticism that foreshadowed his feature-length efforts. The rough-edged quality of the Keystone and Essanay shorts has been replaced by a more polished style, with ""The Rink"" (1916) and ""The Cure"" (1917) displaying remarkable physical virtuosity. Charlie's later films never matched the exuberance and self-assuredness of that glorious 16-month period when the Little Tramp reached his artistic maturity.",5,Chaplin's Finest Work,1215561600,"07 9, 2008",2008,1007,"['When', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'signed', 'Mutual', 'Film', 'Company', '1916', 'became', 'highest-paid', 'performer', 'time', 'annual', 'salary', '670,000', 'produced', 'dozen', 'two-reelers', 'served', 'blueprint', 'rest', 'career', 'Mutuals', 'captured', 'essence', 'Chaplin', 'serio-comic', 'brilliance', 'revealing', 'artist', 'creative', 'peak', 'A', 'stronger', 'sense', 'ensemble', 'was', 'evident', 'menacing', 'presence', 'Eric', 'Campbell', 'who', 'became', 'regarded', 'ideal', 'Chaplin', 'heavy', 'Easy', 'Street', 'Immigrant', '1917', 'represent', 'comedian', 'first', 'masterpieces', 'incorporating', 'social', 'criticism', 'foreshadowed', 'feature-length', 'efforts', 'rough-edged', 'quality', 'Keystone', 'Essanay', 'shorts', 'been', 'replaced', 'more', 'polished', 'style', 'Rink', '1916', 'Cure', '1917', 'displaying', 'remarkable', 'physical', 'virtuosity', 'Charlie', 'later', 'films', 'never', 'matched', 'exuberance', 'self-assuredness', 'glorious', '16-month', 'period', 'when', 'Little', 'Tramp', 'reached', 'artistic', 'maturity']",N/A
983225,A1DANN3R216NBI,B000F4TMIW,"Snorre Smari Mathiesen ""Snorri Smari""","[31, 32]","If there's any truth to the proverb that the biggest enemy to great is good, this presentation of Chaplin's Mutual-films is not without an enemy. Granted, these twelve short films, made in 1916-17 to fulfill a contract which made the comedian into the highest-paid entertainer of his day, have been available in at least reasonably good prints through the years. This can be attributed to their lasting popularity, which assured that recent reissues of the films were still in circulation well into the era of TV. With this in mind, Chaplin's earlier films at Keystone and Essanay may appear to have been in more desperate need of restoration, as the public demand for these earlier, somewhat cruder films ceased as the years went by, causing the shape of surviving prints to deteriorate. However, while I fully support the ambition to have both the Keystones and Essanays restored as best as possible, a strong case can be made that it was during his period at Mutual that Chaplin turned out his first masterpieces, and to have these films available in ""at least reasonably good prints"" is simply not satisfying in the long run. This set, RESTORED 90TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION, does not only assure that the entertainment value of the films is kept intact; it actually takes Chaplin's artistic evolution seriously, making viewers able to study every nuance and detail through crisp, crystal-clear presentations. All in all, Image Entertainment has produced the most visually satisfying versions of the Mutual-films, ever.As is to be expected, David Shepard, among others, has been involved in the restoration, using the best sources available. In some cases, most notably in ONE A.M. and THE RINK, the restorations even provide recently discovered footage, apparently not seen since their original releases. As for the music, Carl Davis has been brought in, and he generally does the films justice by providing the scores with an often poetic undercurrent, employing strings for the more devious moments in the films. However, I still don't think anything can match the energetic soundtracks of the Van Beuren-versions of these films from the 30's; die-hard Chaplin-fans will know what I'm referring to. There are a few times in Davis' scores, I'll admit, when I think the music becomes slightly too melancholic, seen in context to what is going on in the films (one example being a few scenes in ONE A.M.). Even so, for the most part this music also works wonderfully.Other than the films themselves, there are quite a few additional treasures to be enjoyed. First, two documentaries are included; THE GENTLEMAN TRAMP (78 min.) and CHAPLIN'S GOLIATH (54 min.). The former dates back to 1975, and should be of interest to most Chaplin-fans, as it is the sole documentary ever made on his life which had the comedian involved in its making. The film is narrated by none other than Walter Matthau, and includes much archival footage as well as beautifully shot home movies. The second documentary covers the life of Chaplin's irreplacable ""giant"" during the Mutual-period, Eric Campbell, based partly on insights from the heavy man's granddaughter and Chaplin-biographer David Robinson. Also among the extras are two fine and very interesting booklets, ""The Chaplin Mutuals"" by Jeffrey Vance and ""The Making of The Gentleman Tramp"" by Richard Patterson. There's also a photo gallery on both discs (identical to one another, as far as I can see).Some viewers have observed that some films are not entirely complete; for instance, there seems to exist a few moments of footage of THE CURE not included in this set. Even so, this edition is the closest to perfection anyone has come yet, and I'm incredibly grateful for it. To newcomers of Chaplin, shorts such as EASY STREET and THE IMMIGRANT should work as splendid introductions. Well worth the money!
