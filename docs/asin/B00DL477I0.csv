He could've been snarky about it or whatever, but the fact is he should be thankful and should have at least given her some credit for how that eventually helped him learn about himself.He's still a little hooked in the last relationship they show, but not as bad and he is starting to see the light.

1657256,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00DL477I0,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 2]","I swear to god I didn&#8217;t plan this, but it is oddly appropriate that the 69th film I see from the film year that is 2013 happens to be &#8216;Don Jon&#8217;.  I honestly couldn&#8217;t have planned this out if I tried, but I do keep track and yes it is true.I&#8217;ve been excited to see this movie since I saw the first trailer.  I take that back.  It goes even further back than that.  Remember back when there were those rumors that Scarlett Johansson and Joseph Gordon-Levitt were the cutest couple in Hollywood only to have those rumors merely be the start of this collaboration, which happened to be Joseph&#8217;s directorial debut?  Yeah, I&#8217;ve been excited to see the two of them together on the big screen since then.  Sadly, my life doesn&#8217;t always accommodate my every cinematic desire, and convincing my wife to see a movie starring Scarlett Johansson (who she hates for her good looks and my shameless obsession with) about porn addiction was not going to be an easy sell, so it had to wait.Honestly, watching this this afternoon while my wife was out felt a lot like sneaking porn, not because &#8216;Don Jon&#8217; is overly pornographic in nature but because I knew she&#8217;d be upset if she found out about it.I other words, it would have went down similar to when Barbara checked Jon&#8217;s browsing history.&#8216;Don Jon&#8217; didn&#8217;t meet with a lot of criticism.  It met with some, and I read into it, but overall it was considered a pretty impressive directorial debut.  Watching &#8216;Don Jon&#8217; I found myself finding it more than merely impressive, at least for a while.  In fact, my huge hitch with &#8216;Don Jon&#8217; is that it feels like two separate films, and so in the end it suffers from an identity crisis of sorts.  I obviously blame Gordon-Levitt&#8217;s inexperience for this, but at the end of the day his tenacity and obvious knack for storytelling and cinematic framing should not be overlooked.  The first half of the film plays out like a French New Wave inspired episode of &#8216;Jersey Shore&#8217;, and I mean that in complete and total gleeful excitement.  The slow motion exagerations, the stereotypical clich&eacute;s dripping from every frame and Scarlett Johansson&#8217;s gum smacking perfection; all these elements felt so beautifully inspired and complete.I was in love.In fact, the only other film this year to make me smile as much as this one was &#8216;Enough Said&#8217;, and we all know how perfect I think that film is.  Yes, for the majority of this film, even the scenes that I didn&#8217;t think fit the mold the way they should have, I was smiling ear to ear.  It&#8217;s just a fun, flirty and happy film.  It&#8217;s like the comedic version of &#8216;Shame&#8217;, which I know sounds really odd and yet it kind of works.  Even Gordon-Levitt&#8217;s seeming directorial quirks (many griped about the film&#8217;s repetitious sequences) work in the context of the film, and the way that he explores quite a few themes (from addiction to religion to relationships) without every once getting heavy handed is rather remarkable.  While it does resort to &#8216;telling Jon the problem he already knows he has&#8217;, I do like the way that the first half of &#8216;Don Jon&#8217; nonchalantly outlines the core of Jon&#8217;s problem, that porn allows him to completely let go without having to engage anyone else.  The countless one night stands mean nothing and so he can&#8217;t connect, but the mindless porn, while meaning absolutely nothing in the grand scheme of things, mean more because he can get whatever he wants out of it.But with all this praise comes a bit of negative energy as well.  There were two characters that I just couldn&#8217;t support because they made Joseph&#8217;s otherwise effortless and easy film feel contrived and reaching.  First, Monica, Jon&#8217;s silent sister.  I called it from the first scene that she was going to be that one character who says nothing until the very end, where she spits out some &#8216;words of wisdom&#8217; brought on by her silent observations.  Yes, she was right (and thankfully up until she &#8216;said it&#8217;, the film was very subtle in the buildup) but it felt unnecessary.  Even more distasteful for me was the character of Esther, the cougar/advice dispenser who befriends Jon about halfway through and serves and the catalyst of change for his character.  It just felt like a very clich&eacute;d way to go, and while &#8216;Don Jon&#8217; as a whole is a film that is built on clich&eacute;s (from the Guido mentality to the Italian family), this particular clich&eacute; took itself too seriously.And her backstory just felt completely out of place.Still, &#8216;Don Jon&#8217; is a blast and shows a lot of promise for the young director.  It also sports a hilariously pitch perfect ensemble.  Gordon-Levitt carries the film with deepened vocals and a swag that can&#8217;t be manufactured, and his entire crazy family (from Larson to Danza to a hilarious Glenne Headly) makes every scene a delight.  But the film does belong to Scarlett Johansson, who has never been funnier.  She never breaks character and delivers a delicious portrayal of a man-eater, and she just gets it.  Think Marisa Tomei in &#8216;My Cousin Vinny&#8217; for the MTV crowd.  She spits the banter like a pro, and her line readings are honestly my favorite from anyone I&#8217;ve seen so far this year.&#8220;You don&#8217;t think I could make you happy if I wanted to?&#8221;Oh, I&#8217;m sure you could.",4,A promising star to Gordon-Levitt&#8217;s directorial career&#8230;,1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,5557,"['swear', 'god', 'didn', '8217', 'plan', 'oddly',

1657257,A2E86XWGYF631O,B00DL477I0,Andrew Hill,"[0, 1]","The movie was put together in an interesting fashion - the complete process is excellently explained in the extras provided on the Blu-Ray disc. The actors were all quite suited to their characters. Everything should have come together into a stunning movie. My problem, however, is that an addiction to anything is caused by pleasure extracted from that causing the addiction. Yes, the hero certainly does watch the porn and seems addicted to it. But the scenes where he is &#34;on the computer&#34; are not showing any real &#34;pleasure.&#34; Just momentary relief. And this takes whatever is &#34;sexy&#34; (which would lead to his addiction) in the film and really eliminates the pleasure of &#34;sex&#34; from the addiction - even to the point of making it laughable after seeing the hero simply pleasuring himself (without really showing actual pleasure) repeatedly in too many identical scenes:  it actually becomes boring - just the opposite of what a porn addiction should present.This is a strange comedy - as the subject is really not funny at all. And that is probably the problem with the movie. Done without the attempted comedy aspect - this movie would be a stunning and much more realistic drama - and they had the actors who could have pulled it off.

He goes one further here by both writing and directing this ambitious, if not entirely successful, film.Here's the scoop. Don (Levitt) is a Jersey boy who is way into porn. It's sex without the involvement. He now finds himself in a relationship with a girl (Scarlett Johansson) that gets serious, and needs to choose between real people or fake porn. The situation is exacerbated when he runs into a slightly older woman (Julianne Moore) who puts another spin on the ball.This is a genuinely enjoyable movie. Levitt has crafted a nifty character. He's a likeable sort with a large degree of self discipline. His only downside is his addiction to porn. But he has his reasons for his enjoyment and he articulates them well. But now he's involved with the real deal (or so he thinks) and it's a tightrope of a walk. And Moore's character puzzles him even further.This is directed and acted well. Even Ton Danza, whom I'd given up on, turns in a fine performance. Glenne Headly is always a pleasure to watch. Seeing Scarlett Johannson as a Jersey Jewish princess really got me. I've never seen her in a role like this and she excels.The problem here is the script itself. There is both a story and character arc but it arcs a bit too quickly. There needed to be more instances that were smaller and more subtle that add to Don's change. And it just barely ends. It more just kind of stops.For a first outing this is a heck of an effort.

1657301,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00DL477I0,FNDNreview,"[67, 84]","If you believe the porn industry has no relevance in the modern world, you're sadly mistaken.  Like it or loathe it, porn is big business, earning somewhere in the ballpark of $10-15 billion per year.  Much like Hollywood, the adult film industry has stars of its own, a few of which have managed to become household names, most notably of which include Linda Lovelace, Jenna Jameson, and Ron Jeremy.  It should come as no surprise that pornography has been around since man began using the printing press, and speaking of men, they are by far and away (statistically) the greatest abusers of the material.  As it pertains to relationships, and depending who you ask, porn will either ruin a relationship or stimulate a relationship.  All of this and more, including the impact porn has on the male species and how it comes into play during relationships happens to be the basis for the new comedy, Don Jon.Joseph Gordon-Levitt makes his feature length directorial debut, also writing and starring in the comedy, Don Jon.  Gordon-Levitt stars as Jon, but his friends call him ""The Don"" because of his outstanding success with the ladies.  Jon enjoys several aspects of life, including his place, ride, boys, church - and porn.  In fact, his biggest addiction is online porn.  One night at the club, Jon meets a beautiful girl, Barbara (Scarlett Johansson), but this girl isn't like the rest of girls he meets.  He actually has to work to get her into bed, but that's perfectly fine with him.  He's so attracted to this girl that he's willing to do the things she wants him to do to in order to make her happy - including going back to school.  To complicate matters, Barbara walks in on him watching porn, and adamantly demands that he promise to stop.  He agrees, but is unable to control his urge, even watching it while he's in school - where he also befriends an emotional woman, Esther (Julianne Moore).  Tony Danza, Glenne Headly, Brie Larson, Rob Brown, and Jeremy Luke also star in supporting roles.Before this review goes any further, it should be noted that if you're even a little bit squeamish or easily embarrassed by heavy doses of pornography or sex, this film isn't for you and you should feel free to move on right now.  There are very few scenes over the course of his film that doesn't include sex, porn, and a discussion about those two particular topics.  At the same time, films that usually incorporate a great deal of sexuality normally wouldn't mesh well with religion.  Still, this film manages to heavily combine sex and the church, as this lead character obviously cares about his religion, and his porn.  Often humorously, Jon makes weekly confessions about his indiscretions, despite his willingness to repeatedly sin - and without fail, is absolved of his sins and told to do several Hail Marys.This film's concept might seem like a questionable means of entertainment, but Don Jon raises a great deal of questions and observations about society.  Not only does the film make a decent point about society's interaction with porn, but it also delves into the relationship aspect and consequence.  Society has clearly gotten to a point where porn isn't as much of a concern as it used to be, other than to certain individuals who are controlling or self-conscious - at least that's a point this film tries to make.  Naturally, it uses a great deal of comedy to get its point across, but not really laugh-out-loud comedy.  Don Jon's comedy is a bit more ironic that blatantly funny, especially since the majority of the humor comes from the male characters ogling at pretty girls in tight dresses.Don Jon might be the name of this film, but it could just as easily be called the Joseph Gordon-Levitt Show.  He writes, directs, and stars in this film - and thrives in each and every position.  For anyone that's skeptical that Gordon-Levitt chewed off more than he could handle, they couldn't be more wrong.  In fact, he is so superb in every aspect of this film that it's hard to determine which role he thrives in more than the other.  He writes these characters in such an openly comical manner that it's difficult not to love all of the characters in this story.  And, since he's the dominant character of this flick, he easily steals these scenes, meshing most enjoyably with Tony Danza - his vulgar, football watching father.  Finally, as far as the directing goes, you'd never suspect that this was Gordon-Levitt's first feature in the directing chair - smartly incorporating several porn clips and videos to impose his messages.Gordon-Levitt's character (complete with Guido look and vocabulary) is only as strong as the supporting characters around him, including the incredibly attractive Scarlett Johansson - complete with Jersey accent and constant gum-chewing.  Johansson's casting is easily understandable and she plays her part well, but the casting of Academy Award nominee Julianne Moore is much more questionable.  Her acting ability in this film is not in question, and she's masterful as always, but she's nearly 20 years older than Gordon-Levitt, making her an odd choice for a female lead in a film starring a far younger cast.  Regardless, the supporting cast is extremely charming, led by the humorous Tony Danza - portraying an F-Bomb dropping father, and Brie Larson, portraying Gordon-Levitt's silent, constantly texting sister.  And, while it may appear that she's just in the family scenes for show, she turns out to be one of the most impactful characters in the film.Overall, Don Jon is a smart, raunchy comedy that will make you blush and leave you laughing from its brutal amount of irony.  This film has created an endless amount of buzz (and praise) for Joseph Gordon-Levitt as he literally has his finger on every meaningful aspect of this film.  However, this film is strictly for a younger crowed, or at least a crowd that is comfortable with a tremendous amount of sexual discussion - not to mention constant porn clips.  Even though this film is speaking to where we are as a society, Don Jon stays true to the story it's telling - focusing less on romantic relationships and more on the conflict of Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character.  This film truly is a remarkably entertaining feat for Gordon-Levitt and it's impossible not to look forward to his next writing/directing/acting endeavor.GRADE:  B+FNDNreview.com",5,"Joseph

1657303,A8DDR9M8BPACT,B00DL477I0,Gary Nackenson,"[1, 1]","I am struck by the polarization of reviews of this movie. 672 reviews, with 168 reviews giving 1 star. None of the one star reviews I read have any real content, they just all seem to say 'this movie was worthless'.It is true, as many of the positive reviews have pointed out, that the main character treats women like objects. I would like to take the discussion a little deeper.1. The key value of the movie, besides its being enjoyable entertainment (if marred a bit by Tony Danza and Glenne Headly's overacting) is its breaking of stereotypes about porn. The main character is very honest as to why he likes porn - focusing on his own pleasure, he says, is better than sex because when having sex, he feels confined to do what the women seem to want him to do and not ask for what he wants.  It could be said that although he presents himself as a macho guy who doesn't respect women, in reality he puts women on a pedestal. I would venture to guess that this is not an uncommon factor in creating what is so often called 'porn addiction'.  The stereotypical view of porn addiction that it simply defocuses the male away from his partner towards a 'perfect woman' or a '10' is somewhat challenged by the fact that this guy can have any woman he wants. The other aspect of porn addiction most often discussed, that the woman in porn will 'do anything the man wants', is well presented here, but with greater depth than most books on porn addiction have. Interesting feature for such a seemingly inconsequential movie!2. The women the main character falls in love with only makes this worse for him by demanding , in princess like fashion , that he put her on even more of a pedestal. in fact, she treats him in a somewhat contempuous fashion, pushing him to be ambitious when he actually just isn't. This is because SHE is treating HIM like an object - the reason she demands that he never talk about cleaning, something which he is passionate about, is that it doesn't conform to her image of the perfect masculine man.3. The reason that 'the sex is so great' with Julianne Moore is that she sees him as a whole person, with a balanced view of his good qualities and flaws, which catalyzes a change that causes him to see her (and women in general) more as whole people.The movie is a commentary on how sexually wounding and cruel both men and women's expectations of each other can be.",4,a very interesting and original movie -,1399593600,"05 9, 2014",2014,2390,"['am', 'struck', 'polarization', 'reviews', 'movie', '672', 'reviews', '168', 'reviews', 'giving', '1', 'star', 'None', 'one', 'star', 'read', 'have', 'real', 'content', 'just', 'seem', 'say', ""'this"", 'movie', 'was', ""worthless'.It"", 'true', 'many', 'positive', 'reviews', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'main', 'character', 'treats', 'women', 'objects', 'would', 'like', 'take', 'discussion', 'little', 'deeper.1', 'key', 'value', 'movie', 'being', 'enjoyable', 'entertainment', 'marred', 'bit', 'Tony', 'Danza', 'Glenne', 'Headly', 'overacting', 'breaking', 'stereotypes', 'porn', 'main', 'character', 'very', 'honest', 'why', 'porn', 'focusing', 'own', 'pleasure', 'better', 'sex', 'when', 'having', 'sex', 'confined', 'do', 'what', 'women', 'seem', 'want', 'do', 'not', 'ask', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'macho', 'guy', 'who', ""n't"", 'respect', 'women', 'reality', 'women', 'pedestal', 'would', 'venture', 'guess', 'not', 'uncommon', 'factor', 'creating', 'what', 'so', 'often', 'called', ""'porn"", 'addiction', 'stereotypical', 'view', 'porn', 'addiction', 'simply', 'male', 'away', 'partner', ""'perfect"", 'woman', ""'10"", 'somewhat', 'challenged', 'fact', 'guy', 'can', 'have', 'woman', 'other', 'aspect', 'porn', 'addiction', 'most', 'often', 'discussed', 'woman', 'porn', 'will', ""'do"", 'anything', 'man', 'well', 'presented', 'here', 'greater', 'depth', 'most', 'books', 'porn', 'addiction', 'have', 'Interesting', 'feature', 'seemingly', 'inconsequential', 'movie', '2', 'women', 'main', 'character', 'love', 'only', 'worse', 'demanding', 'princess', 'fashion', 'put', 'even', 'more', 'pedestal', 'fact', 'somewhat', 'contempuous', 'fashion', 'pushing', 'be', 'ambitious', 'when', 'actually', 'just', ""n't"", 'SHE', 'treating', 'HIM', 'object', 'reason', 'never', 'talk', 'cleaning', 'something', 'passionate', ""n't"", 'conform', 'image', 'perfect', 'masculine', 'man.3', 'reason', ""'the"", 'sex', 'so', 'great', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'whole', 'person', 'balanced', 'view', 'good', 'qualities', 'flaws', 'change', 'see', 'women', 'general', 'more', 'whole', 'people.The', 'movie', 'commentary', 'how', 'sexually', 'wounding', 'cruel', 'men', 'women', 'expectations', 'other', 'can', 'be']",Don Jon

1657306,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00DL477I0,Grady Harp,"[38, 46]","Joseph Gordon-Levitt keeps testing his boundaries as an artist and that is to be applauded. The strength of his performances in the past few films grows steadily and now he branches out in to writing, directing, and starring in a film that is truly his own. Is it a great film? No, but it is an inventive one  - and that is a breath of fresh air in the current Marvel Comics shoot-`em-bang-bang-explode obsession. The fact that it deals with the current focus on sex-rated themes may be off putting to many, but that the theme is solely that speaks loudly for a young writer/director to register a parody of our current shaky quasi-relationship fad.There is not a lot of story so the more brief the synopsis the better: A New Jersey guy, Jon Martello (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) dedicated to his family, friends, and church, develops unrealistic expectations from watching porn and works to find happiness and intimacy with his potential true love. Though he has many sexual liaisons those episodes do not fully satisfy him the way onanism in front of a porn video does. He hits on a tacky, gum-chewing, perfect 10 Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johansson) but that continued dance has its problems. Finally he meets a very strange older woman Esther (Julianne Moore) who puts a bit of meaning into sexual expression and Jon's life changes - maybe.Gordon-Levitt manages to pull together a fine cast (Tony Danza and Glenne Headly as his parents, Rob Brown and Jeremy Luke as his buddies, et al) and keeps the flavor of the accents and the characters very New Jersey. His writing for Jon's weekly confessions in church is hilarious and in general the dialogue is snappy. Gordon-Levitt spent as much time at the gym as he did creating this film and his very buff body is a showpiece! Everyone who sees this film should realize it deserves an R leaning toward X rating, but then most programs on television do these days, so everyone is used to the porn glut. Nice to see an actor take risks like this. Grady Harp, December 13",4,`There's only a few things I really care about in life. My body. My pad.  My family. My church. My boys. My girls.

What do I tell you about this guy that you don't already know. DON JON is a kind of antithesis like take on 500 DAYS OF SUMMER. I liked the humor build up, the unpredictability, the sets used and the minimalist style of the screenplay which made sure there is plenty of room for improvement. It is a cool indie film that stands a little taller than others because it has something to offer which not many films do. I would not change anything about the film and I wouldn't give it 5 stars because it simply doesnt demand that extra star, the film doesnt care.

Following his career from Fifty/Fifty to a supporting role as Robert Lincoln, son of Daniel Day Lewis' President Lincoln, I've always found his skills impressive. He doesn't disappoint in Don Jon. Jon ought to have been cast in Jersey Shore, he's just that much of a Guido. His life revolves around gym, tan laundry and scoring Guidettes in the Jersey clubs he lives in with his friends. In short, Jon is a perfect Bro. He has his posse, his family (the scenes with Tony Danza as his dad are not to be missed), his church, and his narcissism, the last of which could have sunk this film in the hands of a less talented actor. Oh, and did I mention he has his porn? Lots and lots of it. He's addicted to the film dollies he punches out of his computer. No real woman can ever top these babes for him, not even when there's a real woman right there, ready and willing. It's sort of sickly fascinating to watch his obsession with fantasy babes, and his confession that no real woman can take their place. He's got a problem, a monkey on. well not his back, but somewhere else. Of course, he doesn't see this as problem. Until he meets the gum clacking big haired Guidette of his dreams (a typecast Scarlett Johannsen)and falls in love. What's not to like? His family adores her, his friends are a tiny bit jealous,his confessions to his priest a tad more boring,  and all seems to be going well until she discovers his porn fixation. No surprise there, she's repulsed, and she talks him into taking night classes to improve his career options and keep him away from the plastic dollies.

1657314,A1ZQ89XXUHQG6V,B00DL477I0,Jack,"[0, 0]","From the beginning it's obvious that this is not for kids, extremely religious, prudes, church groups thinking it's a romantic take that don't watch porn, or the overly sensitive expecting a bland romance film. It shows a lot of brief clips from porn with some quick topless nudity with sounds. There's some sort-of explicit brief simulated sex scenes. There are so many mixed reviews, most not saying why they liked it or not, that I decided to see for myself. I did not want to watch this because the tagline and many reviews described it as being completely against porn. For the perspective of my review as a masculine guy, I'm pro-women (women can vote, drive, not be forced to stay home, have a career), I'm pro-sex (not repressive sex-negative), believe in sexual freedom for men and women, in favor of most normal porn, and therefore would not want to spend money on a totally anti-porn sex-negative movie. Thus, as a man I was prepared to dislike this movie (not as the puritanical dislike it because of some language and brief clips) but because it sounded extremely anti-porn, however I liked much of it. The tagline and most reviews are using this film to one sided blame everything on porn, whereas even the director JGL has said it is not just about porn, it's about relationships. The directing of JGL was good. All the acting was good and there was some comedy that not everyone would get, so that's why I bumped it up to four stars for this as a regular movie. The restaurant and theater scenes where well done in a classic romance movie way. Some guys may get the humor in the hallway scene with her tone of voice as she is seducing him to take the class, get a better job, and wanting to meet his family. During intimacy he doesn't even do what he says he likes and has opportunities to do. He is not a completely masculine man, not because of porn, but within himself, and he hides the truth from her that yes he did watch porn while she was there in his bed just to please her and this shows his weakness not strength (imagine if it was Thor watching porn, were you watching porn, yup, goodnight Thor). He's a wimp and let's her boss him around and take over his own apartment. Barbara wanted a fairy tale wedding, is critical of him in the gym, yells at him, Barbara talks about more money. To those who say this is a anti-porn movie watch the scene picking out the curtains, he shouldn't clean although he enjoys it, she is bossy and tells him what to do, says she is moving in, goes through his stuff, and goes crazy. He is not a Don Juan (missing the ua), if he was he would have got a maid and had a Vicky Cristina Barcelona. Esther says she is not judgmental, but she is. In the vehicle Esther criticizes his manly abilities and he puts up with it. Esther says he is addicted to porn, as she is SMOKING. Esther does not care about Jon either, with the smoke. Esther is an older woman using him, but he doesn't see that now. With an addiction to smoking Esther is smoking AGAIN. In an epic scene for this movie Jon's sister tells the truth that Barbara only wanted a guy to fulfill her own agenda, etc. There is an Inception-esq bathtub, and then Esther and Jon talk and tantra and it's as if they have this close emotional connection possibly showing how it's not about the physical. Esther already has a previous husbands house. Not watching porn for a week was not what allowed them to talk for a few minutes (maybe it was the Inception bathtub). This is not The People Vs Larry Flynt showing why porn is good for freedom. Don Jon doesn't seem to say if there's addictions to sports, tank tops, weekly church confessions, gym, fairy tales, romance movies, or letting other people control you. Other reviews are probably not going to say that only courtship for over a month could mean controlling trouble, or if neither will enthusiastically do some intimate things mentioned in the film then they are not completely into each other. Jon the character is not too swift, so there probably won't be a Don Jon 2 about Esther's pad/ride/money once she's done using Jon.",4,One Sided Tagline Not What Director Has Said,1393977600,"03 5, 2014",2014,4094,"['beginning', 'obvious', 'not', 'kids', 'extremely', 'religious', 'prudes', 'church', 'groups', 'thinking', 'romantic', 'take', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'porn', 'overly', 'sensitive', 'expecting', 'bland', 'romance', 'film', 'lot', 'brief', 'clips', 'porn', 'quick', 'topless', 'nudity', 'sounds', 'sort-of', 'explicit', 'brief', 'simulated', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'most', 'not', 'saying', 'why', 'liked', 'not', 'decided', 'see', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'watch', 'tagline', 'many', 'reviews', 'described', 'being', 'completely', 'porn', 'perspective', 'review', 'masculine', 'guy', ""'m"", 'pro-women', 'women', 'can', 'vote', 'drive', 'not', 'be', 'forced', 'stay', 'home', 'have', 'career', ""'m"", 'pro-sex', 'not', 'repressive', 'sex-negative', 'believe', 'sexual', 'freedom', 'men', 'women', 'favor', 'most', 'normal', 'porn', 'therefore', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'spend', 'money', 'totally', 'anti-porn', 'sex-negative', 'movie', 'Thus', 'man', 'was', 'prepared', 'dislike', 'movie', 'not', 'puritanical', 'dislike', 'language', 'brief', 'clips', 'sounded', 'extremely', 'anti-porn', 'however', 'liked', 'much', 'tagline', 'most', 'reviews', 'are', 'using', 'film', 'one', 'sided', 'blame', 'everything', 'porn', 'whereas', 'even', 'director', 'JGL', 'said', 'not', 'just', 'porn', 'relationships', 'directing', 'JGL', 'was', 'good', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'comedy', 'not', 'everyone', 'would', 'get', 'why', 'bumped', 'up', 'four', 'stars', 'regular', 'movie', 'restaurant', 'theater', 'scenes', 'where', 'well', 'done', 'classic', 'romance', 'movie', 'way', 'guys', 'may', 'get', 'humor', 'hallway', 'scene', 'tone', 'voice', 'seducing', 'take', 'class', 'get', 'better', 'job', 'wanting', 'meet', 'family', 'intimacy', ""n't"", 'even', 'do', 'what', 'opportunities', 'do', 'not', 'completely', 'masculine', 'man', 'not', 'porn', 'truth', 'did', 'watch', 'porn', 'was', 'there', 'bed', 'just', 'please', 'weakness', 'not', 'strength', 'imagine', 'was', 'Thor', 'watching', 'porn', 'were', 'watching', 'porn', 'goodnight', 'Thor', 'wimp', 'let', 'boss', 'around', 'take', 'over', 'own', 'apartment', 'Barbara', 'wanted', 'fairy', 'tale', 'wedding', 'critical', 'gym', 'yells', 'Barbara', 'more', 'money', 'who', 'say', 'anti-porn', 'movie', 'watch', 'scene', 'picking', 'out', 'curtains', 'should', ""n't"", 'clean', 'bossy', 'what', 'do', 'moving', 'stuff', 'crazy', 'not', 'Don', 'Juan', 'missing', 'ua', 'was', 'would', 'have', 'got', 'maid', 'had', 'Vicky', 'Cristina', 'Barcelona', 'Esther', 'not', 'judgmental', 'vehicle', 'Esther', 'manly', 'abilities', 'up', 'Esther', 'addicted', 'porn', 'SMOKING', 'Esther', 'not', 'care', 'Jon', 'smoke', 'Esther', 'older', 'woman', 'using', ""n't"", 'see', 'now', 'addiction', 'smoking', 'Esther', 'smoking', 'AGAIN', 'epic', 'scene', 'movie', 'Jon', 'sister', 'truth', 'Barbara', 'only', 'wanted', 'guy', 'fulfill', 'own', 'agenda', 'etc', 'Inception-esq', 'bathtub', 'then', 'Esther', 'Jon', 'talk', 'tantra', 'have', 'close', 'emotional', 'connection', 'possibly', 'showing', 'how', 'not', 'physical', 'Esther', 'already', 'previous', 'husbands', 'house', 'Not', 'watching', 'porn', 'week', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'allowed', 'talk', 'few', 'minutes', 'maybe', 'was', 'Inception', 'bathtub', 'not', 'People', 'Vs', 'Larry', 'Flynt', 'showing', 'why', 'porn', 'good', 'freedom', 'Don', 'Jon', ""n't"", 'seem', 'say', 'addictions', 'sports', 'tank', 'tops', 'weekly', 'church', 'confessions', 'gym', 'fairy', 'tales', 'romance', 'movies', 'letting', 'other', 'people', 'control', 'Other', 'reviews', 'are', 'probably', 'not', 'going', 'say', 'only', 'courtship', 'month', 'could', 'mean', 'controlling', 'trouble', 'will', 'enthusiastically', 'do', 'intimate', 'things', 'mentioned', 'film', 'then', 'are', 'not', 'completely', 'other', 'Jon', 'character', 'not', 'too', 'swift', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'Don', 'Jon', '2', 'Esther', 'pad/ride/money', 'done', 'using', 'Jon']",Don Jon

In this R-rated comedy (that he wrote and directed) he addresses some contemporary issues. The ubiquity of pornography has had a major impact on the dating game. Young men learn self-satisfaction and little else, while young women seek their own (maybe not sexual) self-satisfaction from other sources, e.g., chick flicks and shopping.Several things jumped out at me: 1) The dialog coach was brilliant. Everyone in the cast had perfect Jersey accents, including the unique inflections. 2) Scarlett Johansson was amazing; she is the ultimate actress. 3) Do all Catholics keep score each week so their confessions are accurate? If so, why is the penance always the same?Take a look at these players:* Joseph Gordon-Levitt (""Premium Rush"") is the legendary horndog who comes to realize that his expectations for a partner are unrealistic because they are based on porno films. His weekly routine always includes church on Sunday (and that itemized confession).* Scarlett Johansson (""The Avengers"") plays the woman of his dreams. She even gets him to buy curtain rods!* Julianne Moore (""What Maisie Knew"") is in our hero's class; every young man should have a classmate like her!* Tony Danza (Lots of TV) will make you groan when you see his response to his son's date.* Glenne Headly (""Kit Kittredge: An American Girl"") makes a pasta dish for Sunday dinner every week. She looks like a grandmother but has no grandchildren to show for it!* Brie Larson (""21 Jump Street"") is our hero's texting sister who finally opens her mouth and speaks!Be warned that this is about pornography, so it includes a LOT of film clips; it is about young, single men in the dating game, so it includes a LOT of profanity; it is about growing up, so it includes a lot of confusion and humor. But I LOVED the don't-blink-or-you'll-miss-them cameos by extremely well-known contemporaries who obviously got a big kick out of helping their friend.The theater was packed with young adult couples.

1657335,A2R1YK3THA0RB3,B00DL477I0,Josh,"[0, 1]","After my last review on Thor the Dark World, I kinda took a step back and told myself I needed a break. I was planning to take a break from movie watching and reviewing, but I did not plan to watch movies like You're Next, Dead Man Down, and Don Jon during this period. Nonetheless, that is exactly what ended up happening, and today I bring my review on the movie Don Jon.Don Jon introduces us to Jon Martello(classic name huh?) and Jon is a guy who is has his own house,car, etc. He is a player, meaning he gets a lot of girls for sex, but the strange thing about our character Jon, is that although he gets plenty of girls, he watches pornography. As a matter of fact he tells us(the audience) that he prefers the porn movies. Soon Jon meets the a girl Barbara Sugarman who he believes to be the girl he has been waiting his whole life for. But  as luck would have it, he meets another lady by the name of Esther who we see as being the better girl for Jon. And so begins our movie.I have to say that as a fan of Joseph Gordon Levitt and independent films, I was excited to hear earlier last year that he would be directing a his own movie for the first time. And once I read up on the premise, I won't say I wasn't in the least bit baffled; because in all honesty I was, but I figured that Don Jon would still be a movie worth watching. And for the most part it is. We get a guy who has the good looks gets all the girls, watches porn and goes to church on Sunday. Its funny too because (SPOILER) in the film one of our main female characters compares him to a junkie. But there are some serious moments in the movie as well. If I could point out some of the highlights of the film, would be Julianne Moore's and Scarlett Johansson's performances.Don Jon is like Spring Breakers in a sense because it has topics that we tend to avoid or are too ashamed to discuss, but I do feel that it has this charisma or confidence about it that makes it a movie worth mentioning. Because lets be honest, any other movie about a guy's addiction to porn would probably not be as worthwhile as this movie is. I won't say that after you watch this movie you are going to want to go out and buy it(which, if you do then to each his/her own), but I will say that Don Jon is a movie that gets:3.5 StarsRated RStarring: Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Scarlett Johansson, Tony Danza, Julianne Moore, Brie Larson,",4,A Decent directorial debut from Joseph Gordon Levitt,1392422400,"02 15, 2014",2014,2386,"['last', 'review', 'Thor', 'Dark', 'World', 'kinda', 'took', 'step', 'back', 'told', 'needed', 'break', 'was', 'planning', 'take', 'break', 'movie', 'watching', 'reviewing', 'did', 'not', 'plan', 'watch', 'movies', ""'re"", 'Next', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Down', 'Don', 'Jon', 'period', 'Nonetheless', 'exactly', 'what', 'ended', 'up', 'happening', 'today', 'bring', 'review', 'movie', 'Don', 'Jon.Don', 'Jon', 'Jon', 'Martello', 'classic', 'name', 'huh', 'Jon', 'guy', 'who', 'own', 'house', 'car', 'etc', 'player', 'meaning', 'lot', 'girls', 'sex', 'strange', 'thing', 'character', 'Jon', 'plenty', 'girls', 'pornography', 'matter', 'fact', 'audience', 'porn', 'movies', 'Soon', 'Jon', 'girl', 'Barbara', 'Sugarman', 'who', 'be', 'girl', 'been', 'waiting', 'whole', 'life', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'lady', 'name', 'Esther', 'who', 'see', 'being', 'better', 'girl', 'Jon', 'so', 'movie.I', 'have', 'say', 'fan', 'Joseph', 'Gordon', 'Levitt', 'independent', 'films', 'was', 'excited', 'hear', 'earlier', 'last', 'year', 'would', 'be', 'directing', 'own', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'once', 'read', 'up', 'premise', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'least', 'bit', 'baffled', 'honesty', 'was', 'figured', 'Don', 'Jon', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'most', 'part', 'get', 'guy', 'who', 'good', 'looks', 'girls', 'watches', 'porn', 'church', 'Sunday', 'funny', 'too', 'SPOILER', 'film', 'one', 'main', 'female', 'characters', 'junkie', 'are', 'serious', 'moments', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'point', 'out', 'highlights', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'performances.Don', 'Jon', 'Spring', 'Breakers', 'sense', 'topics', 'tend', 'avoid', 'are', 'too', 'ashamed', 'discuss', 'do', 'feel', 'charisma', 'confidence', 'movie', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'lets', 'be', 'honest', 'other', 'movie', 'guy', 'addiction', 'porn', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'watch', 'movie', 'are', 'going', 'want', 'go', 'out', 'buy', 'do', 'then', 'own', 'will', 'say', 'Don', 'Jon', 'movie', 'gets:3.5', 'StarsRated', 'RStarring', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Tony', 'Danza', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Brie', 'Larson']",Don Jon
1657336,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B00DL477I0,J. Richardson,"[11, 13]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Personally, I&#8217;ve reached a point in my life where very little genuinely surprises me when I go to the movies. Sure, an actor may give an amazing performance, but the content of today&#8217;s films has become repetitious, predictable, and even a little dull. Now that&#8217;s not to say there aren&#8217;t good movies being made, I just feel like there&#8217;s very little out there that actually goes against the grain and explores new territory. This is what ultimately makes Don Jon so enjoyable. Not only does it take these risks, but it does so with a great deal of confidence so you&#8217;re never left feeling uncomfortable.As one would guess, we follow the titular Jon (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a womanizing porn addict who cares more about his looks than he does about settling down. After a night out with his boys Bobby (Rob Brown) and Danny (Jeremy Luke), Jon meets Barbara (Scarlett Johansson). Though she may have shut him down initially, Barbra eventually gives in due to Jon&#8217;s persistence. What Jon doesn&#8217;t know, however, is that Barbara is nothing more than a controlling seductress. Sure, she may be a &#8220;dime,&#8221; but she&#8217;s going to mock his quirky personality and attempt to change everything about him. In the end, this leaves Jon on a journey of self-discovery and self-worth.Don Jon is a special film in more ways than one, but it's the way it opened the door to the psychology of both sexes that really caught my attention. On one hand, the media showers men with images and videos of the &#8220;perfect&#8221; woman. Women who have had more than a few alterations to their bodies, and who have been digitally modified to eliminate their physical &#8220;flaws.&#8221; On the other hand, women are suffocated with romantic films that exemplify the &#8220;perfect&#8221; man. Men who have toned bodies, perform &#8220;manly&#8221; activities, and give in to a woman&#8217;s every command. It pokes fun at these societal issues, but it&#8217;s also deadly serious about the message.What surprised me most about Don Jon was its sense of character development. At the beginning of the film the audience sees Jon as this immature, emotionally blind individual. However, as you progress through the narrative, we see him grow both intellectually and emotionally. He&#8217;s more appreciative of the little things in life, and he no longer views the world through this self-created tunnel vision. He may be free to do what he wants with his life, but why should he waste it doing things that leave him unfulfilled? Though he never actually comes out and says this, you can still see it, and that&#8217;s just a testament to Gordon-Levitt&#8217;s talent as both an actor and a writer.Unfortunately, as a result of this character development, there&#8217;s a strange tonal shift within the final act of the movie. Everything up to that point had been fun and upbeat, but, out of nowhere, it just came to a screeching halt. It was at this point I realized that I was slowly becoming disengaged. It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m against transforming a story into something more meaningful&#8212;check out my review for Seeking a Friend for the End of the World&#8212;but it needs to feel natural. Had they allowed some more time for the movie to play out, the transition could have been a lot smoother. Unfortunately, I think Gordon-Levitt felt obligated to keep it within an hour and a half simply because this is an independent film. At the end of the day, this left the story feeling a bit rushed.Still, considering there were a lot of areas for this movie to go wrong, it&#8217;s no small feat that this was my only complaint. Seeing Jon go through his weekly routine never got old, and observing the way he interacted with Barbara was both entertaining and brutally honest. Today&#8217;s relationships are so broken due to the media&#8217;s influence on our lives, and I think Don Jon did a phenomenal job of portraying that. Also, the fact that JGL made us wait the entire movie to hear Jon&#8217;s sister Monica (Brie Larson) open her mouth drove me insane, but I was glad that when she finally spoke her input was both profound and meaningful&#8212;showing us that even though young adults may appear disinterested, they are still paying attention.Finally, the performances across the board were fantastic. We already know Gordon-Levitt can act, but he continues to show his range with his performance as Jon. Then there was Scarlett who felt perfectly cast as Barbara. Part of me wanted to strangle her by the end of the movie, but that was because of Barbara&#8217;s character, not Scarlett&#8217;s acting. Also, Tony Danza and Glenne Headly performed wonderfully as Jon&#8217;s parents, Jon Sr. and Angela, respectively. The only thing that kind of irritated me about the performances was that, at times, the Boston(?) accents sounded a little forced. Johansson was the worst, but none of the cast members were exempt from over-doing it a bit. Last but not least, you have Julianne Moore who probably gave my favorite performance from the entire film as the experienced, yet troubled Esther. All around a really solid group of actors who did a great job of bringing these characters to life.Overall Score: 8.7/10 - When you really break it down, Don Jon is a romantic comedy just like any other. However, the characters in this story are more unique and fleshed out when compared to your average RomCom. While it may have its flaws, I had a blast watching it, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for something a bit different. Word of advice, though, don&#8217;t bring your kids because the film is very, very sexual.",4,8.7/10 - A unique take on the genre,1385596800,"11 28, 2013",2013,5721,"['Note', 'May', 'contain',

There is Jon (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who has a daily addiction to porn and admits he loves it more than sex with the real thing.  Why?  Because as he says, ""he loses himself"", whereas with the real thing he seems to just be going through the motions feeling nothing.  That is until he meets Barbara (Scarlett Johansson), who makes him work for it, or I should say makes him work for her.  She's what he considers a 10 on the scale of the meat market.  Barbara loves all things romance and feels that if a guy really likes her, then he'll succumb to her allure and give her whatever she demands.

Any movie that relies on voice-overs is utilizing a technique that puts the viewer one step away from emotional involvement.  I suspect that given the subject matter of the film, this was done deliberately.  The story revolves around several characters and the objectifying attitudes they exhibit towards the opposite sex.  That objectifying reaches it's peak when the main character (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) becomes addicted to pornography, and finds himself unable to achieve any type of genuine satisfaction without it.  I'm sure the subject matter produces any number of snickers from (particularly the young male) audience, but the fact is there is truth within the message.  The movie isn't preachy in the sense that it condemns pornography altogether, but it does have a point--and it doesn't just point the finger at men either (a refreshing change), when it comes to objectifying partners.  Women are also held accountable.  I particular enjoyed the third part of the film, and his evolving relationship with the older woman.

On the surface ""Don Jon"" is a sex comedy filled with fairly graphic sex and talk about sex, frequent flashes of clips from porn films, and lots of F-words. If you are squeamish about such things, don't see it. But if you are willing, you can find a funny, generous, beautifully made reflection on control, realistic expectations, and how we might think differently about ways in which the entertainments we choose can can reinforce walls around us or light a way across bridges to connection.Gordon-Levitt plays Jon, a twenty-something who orders his life according to rigorous routine, whether it's his gym workouts, his apartment-tidying, his arrival to join his parents and sister at Sunday mass, his weekly trips to the confessional, his wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am hookups with women he meets at the dance club where he and his friends hang out, or his viewing of carefully selected porn clips on his computer. Although he beds plenty of real women, he prefers porn because he gets exactly what he wants from it with no partner imposing her expectations on him.  Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johannson in a brilliant portrayal), a very hot-looking, gum-snapping Jersey princess who loves soft-focus romance movies, catches Jon's eye at the dance club. He really wants Barbara, but she plays hard to get. Trying to please her, he promises to give up porn, but it proves more difficult than he thought. Meanwhile, he meets Esther, a highly emotional, much older woman (Julianne Moore) at a evening college class he enrolls in to please Barbara. Esther challenges Jon in different ways.The supporting cast, including Tony Danza (appropriately, given the movie's themes, the star of television's ""Who's the Boss?"") as Jon's domineering father, does a wonderful job.

1657371,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00DL477I0,M. Oleson,"[0, 3]","Theatrical Review.  There may be spoilers.Joseph Gordon-Levitt not only gives a nice performance but manages to write the script and direct his first film.  He plays Jon, a New Jersey guy proud of his apartment and his car. He goes to church every week, including confession.  His sins are usually two but committed numerous times.  The first is that he regularly has un-married sex.  The second is that he watches porn and masturbates many times.  He recites his penance while he works out (he's proud of his body too).In the early part of the film, Jon narrates over scenes of his two regular sins and explains why the porn is better.  He's addicted but won't admit it.  Eventually, he falls for a beautiful girl at his club.  Barbara (Scarlett Johansson) scores a 10, or as Jon calls it a ""dime"", on the 1-10 scorecard he and his friends have devised.  As Jon and Barbara become a couple, each begins to discover character flaws in the other (big surprise).  Barbara catches Jon on the porn site even after they have sex.  He promises to stop but (surprise) doesn't.At this point, the film seems repetitive and would seem to be heading nowhere.  But then something happens.  Julianne Moore enters the picture as Esther, a classmate at a local college where she and Jon are taking a class together.  Their first meeting is a bit strange and Esther is a bit strange as well.  As Jon struggles with his estrangement from Barbara, he becomes closer to Esther and her secrets.  We finally begin to see how an off-putting film about porn really has more to say.The performances are excellent all around but the three leads are exceptional as we see their characters transition.  Also watch Brie Larson's quiet performance as Jon's younger sister.  The film manages to bridge the gap between a sex farce to a poetic drama.  The film isn't perfect and it took me a while to settle in, but it is a fine beginning to Gordon-Levitt's career behind the camera.",4,3 1/2 stars for a film that bridges the gap between sex farce and poetic drama,1380758400,"10 3, 2013",2013,1951,"['Theatrical', 'Review', 'may', 'be', 'spoilers.Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'not', 'only', 'nice', 'performance', 'write', 'script', 'direct', 'first', 'film', 'Jon', 'New', 'Jersey', 'guy', 'proud', 'apartment', 'car', 'church', 'week', 'including', 'confession', 'sins', 'are', 'usually', 'two', 'committed', 'numerous', 'times', 'first', 'regularly', 'un-married', 'sex', 'second', 'porn', 'many', 'times', 'penance', 'out', 'proud', 'body', 'too', 'early', 'part', 'film', 'Jon', 'scenes', 'two', 'regular', 'sins', 'why', 'porn', 'better', 'addicted', 'wo', ""n't"", 'admit', 'Eventually', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'club', 'Barbara', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', '10', 'Jon', 'dime', '1-10', 'scorecard', 'friends', 'have', 'devised', 'Jon', 'Barbara', 'become', 'couple', 'begins', 'discover', 'character', 'flaws', 'other', 'big', 'surprise', 'Barbara', 'Jon', 'porn', 'site', 'even', 'have', 'sex', 'stop', 'surprise', ""doesn't.At"", 'point', 'film', 'repetitive', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'heading', 'nowhere', 'then', 'something', 'happens', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'picture', 'Esther', 'classmate', 'local', 'college', 'where', 'Jon', 'are', 'taking', 'class', 'together', 'first', 'meeting', 'bit', 'strange', 'Esther', 'bit', 'strange', 'as', 'well', 'Jon', 'estrangement', 'Barbara', 'closer', 'Esther', 'secrets', 'finally', 'begin', 'see', 'how', 'off-putting', 'film', 'porn', 'really', 'more', 'say.The', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'three', 'leads', 'are', 'exceptional', 'see', 'characters', 'transition', 'Also', 'watch', 'Brie', 'Larson', 'quiet', 'performance', 'Jon', 'younger', 'sister', 'film', 'bridge', 'gap', 'sex', 'farce', 'poetic', 'drama', 'film', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'took', 'while', 'settle', 'fine', 'beginning', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'career', 'camera']",Don Jon

1657380,A14SRB2VNHKO3J,B00DL477I0,"Nikki Kasakitis ""Nikki @ Foil the Plot""","[1, 3]","Indie sensation, JGL had a lot to prove when he set out to make his writing/directorial debut. Folks, let me tell you right now, he did it. Don Jon is a theatrical masterpiece. I say masterpiece because it manages to be a dramedy that both men and women can enjoy, as well as a smart cultural commentary on the misrepresentations of the sexes. Don Jon also explores the impossible expectations that set the foundation for many romantic relationships and it does so in both a thought-provoking and funny way. It's a breath of fresh air.Just as JGL's character is trying to find himself, you can see where he struggles to find his directorial voice. Don Jon feels too meticulous and familiar at the start, a little like a Darren Aronofsky film, but eventually he settles into a comfortable rhythm, one that feels uniquely his. He's got a great narrative voice, his timing is impeccable and, most important, there's actual depth underneath all the tongue-and-cheek humour. JGL wisely balances the bawdier material with a touch bold honesty. Don Jon does the impossible by turning the notion of GTL into a work of art, and if JGL can start off with this much of a bang, I think he's got a very promising career ahead of him.On the surface, Jon is your stereotypical Jersey Shore jerk. But underneath that macho exterior lies a man who needs to lose himself in something. And that something just so happens to be porn. On the surface, Barbara seems like his perfect girl. But Jon quickly learns that what you see is not always what you get. JGL is charming and charismatic as the leading stud, Don Jon. He actually makes a sleazy man likeable. Who knew?! But then again, are you really surprised?That just speaks to his raw talent as an actor. While I usually find Scar-Jo to be wooden, she is both a bombshell and willfully strong here. There's a surprising subtlety to her performance that I haven't seen from her before. And behind strong leads there's a solid secondary cast. Tony Danza and Glenne Headly are PERFECT hamming it up as Jon's parents. I have to say, Tony Danza absolutely kills it! And though Brie Larson's part is small, as Jon's tech-absorbed sister, her character is what perpetuates such a dramatic shift in the film. I thought the casting was pretty spot on sans Julianne Moore's role. It's not that her character wasn't believable, because it was --- she's a no frills, observational truth-seeker. Everything that character needed to be. It was just her as that character that I wasn't quite buying.But as a whole, I thought the film was nearly perfect. There is more than meets the eye with Don Jon, which is ironic because that notion is pretty much the core of the entire movie. You watch it to be entertained but walk away with something meaningful to talk about. Don Jon is about letting people in so that they can see the deepest parts of you. It's about the ability to really let yourself go, to know what it feels like to be free. I don't know if I've ever seen a movie that explores the intricacies of love, friendship and sex with as much finesse as Don Jon does. And while it IS a love story, it's also very much a movie about self-discovery. Let's just say, I haven't felt that emotionally satisfied walking out of a theatre in a very long time.Food for Thought: Don Jon is a solid debut by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He's written a touching movie about love and sex, men and women. It's a movie that teaches us how to recognize when we've become victims of false fantasies and shows us the meaning of true intimacy.

1657389,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00DL477I0,Paul Allaer,"[2, 4]","It's surely just coincidence, but this makes two weekends in a row that Hollywood releases a movie dealing with sex addition. Last weekend there was ""Thanks for Sharing"" (starring Mark Ruffalo and Gwyneth Paltrow). Now this.""Don Jon"" (2013 release; 90 min.) brings the story of Jon (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a Jersey boy who loves his body, his pad, his family, his church, his boys, his women and... his porn. In the beginning of the movie Jon and his boys are hanging out at a club, and Jon notices and gets to know Barbara (played by Scarlett Johansson), ""the prettiest thing I've ever seen"" comments Jon. THey hit if off. THings almost get derailed when Barbara spots Jon watching pron, but he gets away with it because ""it was just a joke"". At Barbara's insistance, Jon then starts going to night school (so that he can move up in society). There he gets to know Esther (played by Julianna Moore). To tell you more of the plot would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Coupld of comments: first and foremost, this is the Joseph Gordon-Levitt show all the way. he stars (in fact he is in every single scene of the movie), and he also is the writer and director of the movie (his directing debut). Second, while the first half of the movie certainly is fun and loose (with tongue firmly planted in cheek), the dark and serious undertones are more and more accentuated as the movie progresses. Don Jon (Jon's nickname) has a serious addiction problem (the original title of the movie was ""Don Jon's Addiction""), and he knows it. At one point Barbara hisses to him ""I thought you were different, but you aren't"", and Jon knows he needs to face up to his addiction. Third, setting aside Joseph Gordon-Levitt for a minute, most other acting performances in ""Don Jon"" are simply ace. Scarlett Johansson is your perfect Jersey girl (she reminded me in every which way of Mariah Carey 15-20 years ago). Julianna Moore as the older woman will surprise you with the depth of her performance in this fairly small role. Tony Danza is perfect as the overbearing Jersey dad. And check out Brie Larson as Jon's sister (she has a breakout role in ""Short Term 12"" which I saw just a few weeks ago).I had seen the trailer of this a few times and couldn't wait to see it. I caught it at a matinee showing today here in Cincinnati, and was surprised how well attended this showing was, given the topic of the movie. If you ask me which of ""Thanks for Sharing"" or ""Don Jon"" is the better movie, I must go with ""Don Jon"". It is simply the higher quality, and certainly the more entertaining, movie of the two. I couldn't believe when the lights came on, as ""Don Jon"" has simply flown by in no time. Beware: this is a raunchy comedy with serious undertones and with a fair amount of nudity, so if this offends you, save yourself the trouble (and money).

Don Jon forces us to think about the role online pornography plays in relationships, albeit rather clumsily and with Johansson adopting a bitchy, unwavering approach to the relationship after just a few weeks.With strong performances by both leads, as well as a fairly undeveloped turn as a troubled widow by Julianne Moore, the movie manages to surmount its crassness and soft core to make us think about how this relatively new media affects our romantic and sexual relationships.

The film also has a pre-occupation with trying to promote missionary position.  It's very Catholic.  Think of him as a less homicidal Patrick Bateman... without a maid.I just didn't find the film that funny.  It became rather serious and disturbing later.  The main character and his fellow pothead friends are incredibly shallow, too.  The nightclub scenes are simplistic and one-note.  There's an older character that is suffering a major loss and seems also sad and vulnerable.  The revelations it reaches are not mysterious and are pretty elementary on most of these subjects.  It's just another form of confession.As a close-up of a license plate suggests, Don Jon has more in common with ""Garden State"" than ""This is the End"".  But don't expect the number of laughs as either of those, let alone a-laugh-a-minute.  Like Man of Steel, the trailer was better.  (Trailer #3 is a work of art, but I digress.)  In this case, the full movie is also a little different in tone.And there's lots and lots of porn and sex.  If I had known how much there was in this, I wouldn't have gone to see this in a public place (which I find really strange), let alone taken a foreign friend to it who's from a sexually-repressed country.  I can't imagine any adult justifying why kids should be allowed in the film.  It needed an NC-17 rating.

1657400,AYF7IX9JLHU83,B00DL477I0,"Richard Bellush, Jr.","[1, 3]","At first blush, the flick didn't look promising. ""Don Jon"" is set in NJ and is populated by characters too classless for ""Jersey Shore."" Yet, Jon (Gordon-Levitt) has enough heart underneath his crassness for us soon to start to care what happens to him - barely enough, but enough. (Spoilers follow.)On the surface, the film is about one man's porn addiction, but the target is really bigger: it is about modern narcissism of which Jon's pastime is a symptom. Jon prefers internet porn to real women. He likes real women, to be sure, and is an expert seducer of them: hence the nickname ""Don Jon"" given to him by his friends. He and his pals enjoy cruising sleazy pick-up clubs, and Jon rarely leaves without an 8, 9 or ""dime"" on his 1-to-10 scale. Nevertheless, the flesh-and-blood dates don't ever measure up in his mind to his private sessions in front of his computer screen; in fact, he commonly retreats to his computer after his companion for the evening falls asleep. The advantage to porn sex is that it is all about him. He need bring nothing to the relationship. There is no relationship; his indulgence is entirely one-sided.Jon meets a dime named Barbara (Scarlett Johansson). Jon's father (Tony Danza) leers his approval when he brings her home to meet the family, and compliments Jon on the ""piece of ass."" His sister Monica (Brie Larson) just rolls her eyes while remaining silently glued to her smart phone. Though Jon falls hard for Barbara, even she doesn't equal his porn sessions, so he continues with them. Early on, Barbara catches Jon looking at porn and makes him promise to give it up; Jon doesn't give it up, but is careful to keep his habit out of her sight.Barbara is addicted to her own brand of film fantasies: romantic comedies. Exiting a theater, she gushes to Jon about how romantic the movie was: ""He gave up everything for her,"" she says. Her response to the movie is telling, for it expresses exactly what she wants for herself. In truth, the only thing Barbara brings to her relationship with Jon is sex; otherwise she is entirely one-sided. Everything is about her, and she is highly demanding of Jon in ways large and small. Perhaps this is why she feels so threatened by porn: she senses it is a true rival to her only asset.Barbara snoops on Jon's browser history and is appalled to discover he still visits porn sites - a lot. Barbara accordingly breaks up with him. When Jon reveals the break-up to his family, his parents act as if he has harmed them personally. His mother wails that she wants grandchildren. Monica, though, unexpectedly looks up from her phone and with perfect accuracy tells Jon (her only lines in the whole movie) that he is better off because Barbara just wanted someone to boss around.(This minimalist use of Brie Larson is contrary to expectation precisely because she is capable of so much more - she is a good actress and her vocals for ""Black Sheep"" in ""Scott Pilgrim vs the World"" were better than the original, and I like Metric.)By luck, Jon finally does get a taste of what a real two-way affair is like, thanks to an older, wiser, and open-minded woman named Esther (Julianne Moore). The experience gives him some personal insight about his own shortcomings and motivations.",4,Juan Is the Loneliest Number,1389657600,"01 14, 2014",2014,3251,"['first', 'blush', 'flick', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'promising', 'Don', 'Jon', 'set', 'NJ', 'populated', 'characters', 'too', 'classless', 'Jersey', 'Shore', 'Jon', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'enough', 'heart', 'crassness', 'soon', 'start', 'care', 'what', 'barely', 'enough', 'enough', 'Spoilers', 'follow', 'surface', 'film', 'one', 'man', 'porn', 'addiction', 'target', 'really', 'bigger', 'modern', 'narcissism', 'Jon', 'pastime', 'symptom', 'Jon', 'prefers', 'internet', 'porn', 'real', 'women', 'real', 'women', 'be', 'sure', 'expert', 'seducer', 'hence', 'nickname', 'Don', 'Jon', 'given', 'friends', 'pals', 'enjoy', 'cruising', 'sleazy', 'pick-up', 'clubs', 'Jon', 'rarely', '8', '9', 'dime', '1-to-10', 'scale', 'Nevertheless', 'flesh-and-blood', 'dates', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'measure', 'up', 'mind', 'private', 'sessions', 'front', 'computer', 'screen', 'fact', 'commonly', 'computer', 'companion', 'evening', 'asleep', 'advantage', 'porn', 'sex', 'need', 'bring', 'nothing', 'relationship', 'relationship', 'indulgence', 'entirely', 'one-sided.Jon', 'meets', 'dime', 'named', 'Barbara', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Jon', 'father', 'Tony', 'Danza', 'approval', 'when', 'home', 'meet', 'family', 'compliments', 'Jon', 'piece', 'ass', 'sister', 'Monica', 'Brie', 'Larson', 'just', 'eyes', 'remaining', 'silently', 'glued', 'smart', 'phone', 'Jon', 'hard', 'Barbara', 'even', ""n't"", 'equal', 'porn', 'sessions', 'Early', 'Barbara', 'Jon', 'looking', 'porn', 'promise', 'give', 'up', 'Jon', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'careful', 'keep', 'habit', 'sight.Barbara', 'addicted', 'own', 'brand', 'film', 'fantasies', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'Exiting', 'theater', 'Jon', 'how', 'romantic', 'movie', 'was', 'gave', 'up', 'everything', 'response', 'movie', 'telling', 'exactly', 'what', 'herself', 'truth', 'only', 'thing', 'Barbara', 'relationship', 'Jon', 'sex', 'otherwise', 'entirely', 'one-sided', 'Everything', 'highly', 'demanding', 'Jon', 'ways', 'large', 'small', 'Perhaps', 'why', 'so', 'threatened', 'porn', 'true', 'rival', 'only', 'asset.Barbara', 'snoops', 'Jon', 'browser', 'history', 'appalled', 'discover', 'still', 'porn', 'sites', 'lot', 'Barbara', 'accordingly', 'up', 'When', 'Jon', 'break-up', 'family', 'parents', 'act', 'harmed', 'personally', 'mother', 'grandchildren', 'Monica', 'though', 'unexpectedly', 'up', 'phone', 'perfect', 'accuracy', 'tells', 'Jon', 'only', 'lines', 'whole', 'movie', 'better', 'Barbara', 'just', 'wanted', 'someone', 'boss', 'around', 'minimalist', 'use', 'Brie', 'Larson', 'contrary', 'expectation', 'precisely', 'capable', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'good', 'actress', 'vocals', 'Black', 'Sheep', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'World', 'were', 'better', 'original', 'like', 'Metric', 'luck', 'Jon', 'finally', 'get', 'taste', 'what', 'real', 'two-way', 'affair', 'thanks', 'older', 'wiser', 'open-minded', 'woman', 'named', 'Esther', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'experience', 'personal', 'insight', 'own', 'shortcomings', 'motivations']",Don Jon

She makes him court her first, going to chick flicks. Barbara objects to porn, so Don must hide his addiction. Don also meets and older woman (Julianne Moore) who understands his porn addiction and is not judgmental.The plot doesn't have any real surprises or twists. My question about the film is what was the message? Relationships are important? Old fashion porn is healthy because it has relationships where modern porn does not? A guy will give up his porn on his own if he really into the relationship? i.e if your man watches porn, you're an inadequate woman or he is messed up.  Or a deep Julianne Moore trumps a shallow Scarlett Johansson with a Jersey accent?The film follows a standard formula, except it includes porn. I never really cared for the characters.

1657429,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B00DL477I0,The People's Critic,"[4, 5]","Don Jon presents a surprisingly adult perspective on relationships.  First time writer, director, and star Joseph Gordon-Levitt said he came up with the idea for Don Jon during the filming of a film called 50/50 with Seth Rogan.  In that film, Rogan (who wrote and starred in 50/50) tries to help his friend, played by Gordon-Levitt, through the drama of his recent Cancer diagnosis by coaxing him to lose himself in meaningless sex and to use his Cancer as a sympathy device with women.  Gordon-Levitt&#8217;s character Jon in Don Jon feels like a combination of those two characters, which is quite fascinating.Don Jon, in essence, is a modern retelling of the classic Don Juan legends.  Here, Jon (Gordon-Levitt) is a slick, confident ladies man &#8211; handsome, confident, and consumed with his appearance and the appearance of those with whom he desires intimacy.  As we get to know Jon, we are immersed in his chauvinism and addictive personality.  He hits the gym for his patterned out workout, he hits the church for his prepared confessions, and he hits the Internet for his regular masturbatory sessions.  He also hits the clubs nightly with his friends where they rate women on their appearance, hoping for the elusive &#8220;dime&#8221; or perfect 10.  That &#8220;dime&#8221; appears in the form of Barbara (Scarlett Johansson).  From the moment Jon and Barbara begin their romance, Don Jon stops being a character piece and starts being an intriguing look at adult relationships and how the opposite sexes view each other.  In most retellings of Don Juan legends, the protagonist&#8217;s sinful ways are dealt with very one-dimensionally in that he is punished for taking advantage of those around him.  Gordon-Levitt tries something different.  He tells a far more relatable story about how both men and women are guilty of attaching unreal expectations on each other due to stereotypes perpetuated by a society that profits on obsession; for men it&#8217;s the porn industry and for women it&#8217;s the fairy-tale romantic stories in the movies.As Jon and Barbara&#8217;s relationship continues, Jon&#8217;s addiction with porn complicates things because Jon values the virtual more than the physical.  Meanwhile, Barbara&#8217;s addiction to romantic love stories puts unreal expectations on how Jon is supposed to live his life if he&#8217;s going to be with her.  All of this is explored with a careful eye by Gordon-Levitt, the director.  The culmination of which is his subtle introduction of Esther (Julianne Moore) as an older classmate in Jon&#8217;s night school course.  Gordon-Levitt did wonders for his film by including Moore, and it is apparent from the moment she appears.  His most impressive camera work, acting, and staging occurs in this act, and it all strengthens the film as a whole.Gordon-Levitt has made a fine exploration of one sub-section of modern adult relationships.  While some scenes seem a bit forced in terms of situation and/or dialogue (i.e. the curtain rod scene between Jon and Barbara), most of what he does works very well.  Gordon-Levitt also brilliantly casts Tony Danza in a small part as his character&#8217;s father and gets an excellent little performance out of him.  It may not be time for Academy Award winning filmmaker, Joseph Gordon-Levitt just yet, but he does show promise behind the camera apart from in front of it.  B+Don Jon is rated R and has a running time of 1 hour and 30 minutes.

One of which is porn. Because of this obsession he is unable to have a healthy relationship with anyone. When he meets Barbara (Johansson) he thinks he found the perfect girl. Little by little he begins to wonder if he will ever feel about a woman the way he feels about his porn. First off I will have to say that this is not for everyone. If you offend easy then avoid this. Also the first five minutes are the raunchiest in terms of dialog so if you can make it past that you should be OK. As far as the movie goes I did enjoy it but the thing about this movie is the abundance of sex and porn will distract from the true meaning of the movie. The movie isn't necessarily about addiction but more about watching a man trying to connect with a human in a way he never has before. There are some very funny scenes in this one but it does have a lot of heart and that is the reason to watch. Acting is great but all of this won't be given a fair chance because of the in your face porn aspect. That is a shame.

Here he casts himself against type in the lead role as a lady&#8217;s man, and to his credit he did a decent job. It is good acting. The problem is, it is too obvious that he is acting.

1657435,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00DL477I0,Turfseer,"[0, 0]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Joseph Gordon-Levitt wrote, directed and starred as 'Don Jon', about a New Jersey 'Guido' who is addicted to pornography. When we first meet 'Don Jon', he's hanging out with his pals at a bar, and has no trouble picking up women. There's a good deal of banter between the guys as they rate the women they see in the bar, on a scale of 1 to 10. Jon makes it clear that porn is still superior to having sex with real, live women.Eventually, Jon hooks up with Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johansson), who has a decided 'New Joisy' accent. She attempts to make a man of him by urging him to go to night school to get a more professional job and he indulges her tastes in romantic movies. Barbara keeps him on a leash for a while before they have sex but soon discovers his mean addiction to porn. Jon promises Barbara that he doesn't watch porn and brings her over to meet his over the top parents, who fall in love with her (the parents, are written as over-bearing Italian stereotypes). Finally, Barbara becomes aware that indeed Jon has been lying to her, after discovering that his browser history indicates that he frequents porn sites all the time. Barbara then promptly dumps Jon around the midpoint of the film.Up until this point, the problem with Gordon-Levitt's screen writing is that there's too much repetition. We're constantly bombarded with near X-rated images illustrating Jon's addiction. There's also all those repetitious scenes where Jon is constantly at his local church's confession box, reporting his sexual escapades and porn excesses, to the local priest.Finally, the story takes a more refreshing turn when Jon forms a relationship with Esther (Julianne Moore), a middle-aged widow, who lost her husband and son in a car crash a couple of years before. Esther turns Jon into a 'mensch' by impressing upon him that sex should be much more intimate, leading to a union of souls. Jon takes the bait and now 'Don Jon' has morphed into an updated 'Marty' (the 1955 drama starring Ernest Borgnine, who plays a working class stiff who grows to maturity through the love of a good woman).Would the 'Guidos' of this world, end up opening themselves up to expanding their self-consciousness? In most real-life scenarios, unlikely. But here, after being bombarded with scenes of the boorish Jon 'doing his thing', it's a refreshing twist to have this clueless Guido, suddenly transformed into a sensitive guy, who relates to women as human beings. Many critics found 'Don Jon' to be one-dimensional in many places, which it is--but it also entertains to a good degree and features a neat shift in the protagonist's internal arc.",3,Entertaining but repetitive tale of NJ Guido transformed into a mensch through the love of a good woman,1391990400,"02 10, 2014",2014,2678,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'wrote', 'directed', 'starred', ""'Don"", 'Jon', 'New', 'Jersey', ""'Guido"", 'who', 'addicted', 'pornography', 'When', 'first', 'meet', ""'Don"", 'Jon', 'hanging', 'out', 'pals', 'bar', 'trouble', 'picking', 'up', 'women', 'good', 'deal', 'banter', 'guys', 'rate', 'women', 'see', 'bar', 'scale', '1', '10', 'Jon', 'clear', 'porn', 'still', 'superior', 'having', 'sex', 'real', 'live', 'women.Eventually', 'Jon', 'up', 'Barbara', 'Sugarman', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'who', 'decided', ""'New"", 'Joisy', 'accent', 'make', 'man', 'urging', 'go', 'night', 'school', 'get', 'more', 'professional', 'job', 'tastes', 'romantic', 'movies', 'Barbara', 'leash', 'while', 'have', 'sex', 'soon', 'discovers', 'mean', 'addiction', 'porn', 'Jon', 'Barbara', ""n't"", 'watch', 'porn', 'meet', 'top', 'parents', 'who', 'fall', 'love', 'parents', 'are', 'written', 'over-bearing', 'Italian', 'stereotypes', 'Finally', 'Barbara', 'aware', 'indeed', 'Jon', 'been', 'lying', 'discovering', 'browser', 'history', 'porn', 'sites', 'time', 'Barbara', 'then', 'promptly', 'Jon', 'midpoint', 'film.Up', 'point', 'problem', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'screen', 'writing', 'too', 'much', 'repetition', ""'re"", 'constantly', 'bombarded', 'near', 'X-rated', 'images', 'illustrating', 'Jon', 'addiction', 'also', 'repetitious', 'scenes', 'where', 'Jon', 'constantly', 'local', 'church', 'confession', 'box', 'reporting', 'sexual', 'escapades', 'porn', 'excesses', 'local', 'priest.Finally', 'story', 'more', 'refreshing', 'turn', 'when', 'Jon', 'relationship', 'Esther', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'middle-aged', 'widow', 'who', 'lost', 'husband', 'son', 'car', 'crash', 'couple', 'years', 'Esther', 'Jon', ""'mensch"", 'impressing', 'sex', 'should', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'intimate', 'leading', 'union', 'souls', 'Jon', 'bait', 'now', 'Jon', 'morphed', 'updated', ""'Marty"", '1955', 'drama', 'starring', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'who', 'working', 'class', 'stiff', 'who', 'maturity', 'love', 'good', 'woman', ""'Guidos"", 'world', 'end', 'up', 'opening', 'expanding', 'self-consciousness', 'most', 'real-life', 'scenarios', 'unlikely', 'here', 'being', 'bombarded', 'scenes', 'boorish', 'Jon', ""'doing"", 'thing', 'refreshing', 'twist', 'have', 'clueless', 'Guido', 'suddenly', 'transformed', 'sensitive', 'guy', 'who', 'women', 'human', 'beings', 'Many', 'critics', 'found', ""'Don"", 'Jon', 'be', 'one-dimensional', 'many', 'places', 'also', 'good', 'degree', 'neat', 'shift', 'protagonist', 'internal', 'arc']",Don Jon

A film so frightening and offensive that it will hurt the eyes and ears of Americans because it deals with sex and pornography. Well, while an exaggeration, it was satirically said to show that Don Jon, despite its controversial subject matter, did not get the stigma it received as much as Showgirls and Shame, which are notably rated NC-17 for this kind of thing.While slightly censored from its Sundance debut as Don Jon's Addiction, this R-rated version is notably effective, funny, surprising, and not ham-fisted too much in its craziness that it deserves some special commendation as a debut feature film. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the cantankerous New Jersey iron-pumping jerk who goes out find his way to fulfill his sexually deviant life only to come across a ""10"" when he meets Scarlet Johansson's character, Barbara (a weird name for a young woman). His life goes even more imbalanced when his addiction gets the best of him by affecting his relationship, his weekly Catholic prayers, and his education. The film works on so many levels, surprisingly, to show him as an individual who thinks he has it all but does not and start to slow down the machismo when he meets Julianne Moore's character, Esther, at a community college.While the adverts come across as laugh-out-loud and titillating, the film is a little more darker and twisted in tone yet more human and dramatic toward the end and that, in a way, saves the film quite a bit. Added to that, the energy that is given with the rapid editing, brisk pace (only 90 minutes long), frank material (even without sight of genitalia, gross images of Internet smut are pretty obvious), pumping epilogue, and situational sense of humour are what make Don Jon less of a traditional Don Juan but more of a cautionary tale about sexuality in your 20s for our time. The humour is pretty lively too with a well-crafted, publicised scene involving Jon singing to Marky Mark's Good Vibrations. Tony Danza as his boisterous and stereotypical gruff father is perfect as Jon's father to where he can be a great character study in this review too but with space permitting sometime soon.For a film that deals with sex, it is not corny and not as overtly chauvinistic as some may expect like in That's My Boy, Freddy Got Fingered, Scary Movie, or most pornography but responsibly done with a sense of humour and vibrancy Shame lacked (but that was more of a serious dramatic contemplation of addiction). If daring, give this one a try especially if you are in your 20s. You won't be disappointed!""",4,"Brisk, effective, and snappy yet controversial themes are executed with brilliance.

When dad Tony Danza gets a look at her religious concerns take a back seat to her sheer hotness, which is represented as a commodity here, as it is in the porn that Jon watches incessantly.

In fact I saw 2 women walking out of the theater just as I had been thinking to do so for several minutes.  Something told me I should stay a little longer though since I know Julliane Moore would not choose to do a film she did not believe in and her talent and roster of amazing films speak for themselves.  I was very glad I stayed.The problem is that I didn't know what to expect.  I saw this movie only because it happened to be playing at the right time when I went to the theater that day.  So I took a chance.  The first 15 minutes seemed to be nothing but hard core pornography and cussing.  It seemed like a movie that wasn't planning to do anything other than shock us just for the sake of it.  However this turns out to be wrong.  Don Jon is about how both men and women in our current media obsessed world come up with impossible fantasies which ultimately destroy their relationships.  Women dream of that perfect romantic, sophisticated, handsome man that sacrifices himself for her in the romantic movie genre while men fantasize about perfectly shaped T&A; nymphomaniacs that never age over the age of 24.  Both ideas are ridiculously unrealistic and yet holding on to these ideas of perfection portrayed in the media is why so many relationships and marriages today fail.  As couples who have been married for several decades often say- 'The problem with young people in marriage today is that their expectations are too high and this sets them up for misery and failure.  In our day our expectations in relationships were much more down to earth.'  Don Jon meets the mirror twin of himself when he meets who he thinks is the woman of his dreams.  She, like he- is manipulative when it comes to the opposite sex.  She, like he is looking to fulfill an unrealistic fantasy.  She, like he- cannot be fulfilled in the relationship because it does not match the fantasy of what she thinks things should be like.  As the movie progresses we watch Don emerge from this trap into a more evolved person as he learns to accept the person who he is with and really be with THEM and not a fantasy... while his previous mirror image stays behind repeating her mistakes.  Don Jon's family is also interesting in all this as his desire to please his parents influences what he thinks he wants and later we watch him grow from this as well.  We see Don eventually romance in an unexpected place and experiences it in a way the media never shows.  A good movie over-all.",3,A philosophical romance flick,1389139200,"01 8, 2014",2014,2570,"['must', 'admit', 'when', 'saw', 'theater', 'almost', 'walked', 'out', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'fact', 'saw', '2', 'women', 'walking', 'theater', 'just', 'had', 'been', 'thinking', 'do', 'so', 'several', 'minutes', 'Something', 'told', 'should', 'stay', 'little', 'longer', 'know', 'Julliane', 'Moore', 'would', 'not', 'choose', 'do', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'believe', 'talent', 'roster', 'amazing', 'films', 'speak', 'was', 'very', 'glad', 'stayed.The', 'problem', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'saw', 'movie', 'only', 'happened', 'be', 'playing', 'right', 'time', 'when', 'went', 'theater', 'day', 'took', 'chance', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'seemed', 'be', 'nothing', 'hard', 'core', 'pornography', 'cussing', 'seemed', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'planning', 'do', 'anything', 'other', 'shock', 'just', 'sake', 'However', 'out', 'be', 'wrong', 'Don', 'Jon', 'how', 'men', 'women', 'current', 'media', 'obsessed', 'world', 'come', 'up', 'impossible', 'fantasies', 'ultimately', 'destroy', 'relationships', 'Women', 'dream', 'perfect', 'romantic', 'sophisticated', 'handsome', 'man', 'romantic', 'movie', 'genre', 'men', 'fantasize', 'perfectly', 'shaped', 'T', 'A', 'never', 'age', 'age', '24', 'ideas', 'are', 'ridiculously', 'unrealistic', 'yet', 'holding', 'ideas', 'perfection', 'portrayed', 'media', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'relationships', 'marriages', 'today', 'fail', 'couples', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'married', 'several', 'decades', 'often', 'say-', ""'The"", 'problem', 'young', 'people', 'marriage', 'today', 'expectations', 'are', 'too', 'high', 'up', 'misery', 'failure', 'day', 'expectations', 'relationships', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'down', 'earth', 'Don', 'Jon', 'mirror', 'twin', 'when', 'who', 'woman', 'dreams', 'he-', 'manipulative', 'when', 'opposite', 'sex', 'looking', 'fulfill', 'unrealistic', 'fantasy', 'he-', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'fulfilled', 'relationship', 'not', 'match', 'fantasy', 'what', 'things', 'should', 'be', 'like', 'movie', 'watch', 'Don', 'emerge', 'trap', 'more', 'evolved', 'person', 'accept', 'person', 'who', 'really', 'be', 'THEM', 'not', 'fantasy', 'previous', 'mirror', 'image', 'repeating', 'mistakes', 'Don', 'Jon', 'family', 'also', 'interesting', 'desire', 'please', 'parents', 'what', 'later', 'watch', 'grow', 'as', 'well', 'see', 'Don', 'eventually', 'romance', 'unexpected', 'place', 'experiences', 'way', 'media', 'never', 'good', 'movie', 'over-all']",Don Jon

Stick with a crowd-pleaser that&#8217;s light on character development, doesn&#8217;t tackle the potential darker side of porn addiction or romance novels (or one-dimensional rom-com&#8217;s).  Watch &#8220;The Hangover,&#8221; &#8220;Wedding Crashers,&#8221; &#8220;Dodgeball.&#8221;This film is blunt, graphic, honest &#8211; and refreshing.The cynical, muscle-bound Jon (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is into his appearance and exudes expletive-hurling machismo. He can&#8217;t settle for a 6 or 7, he&#8217;s got to have &#8220;the dime,&#8221; (the ten).  In his world, his girl&#8217;s got to reflect his hotness level. In Scarlett Johansson, (Barbara), he&#8217;s found true love, because the illusion &#8211; note, I say &#8211; illusion &#8211; of her matches up with the box he&#8217;s placed himself in.  She looks great, his folks love her, she&#8217;s Jersey-licious. He still has his porn when he wants a true sexual release &#8211; there, he&#8217;s in control &#8211; and she loves her sappy rom-com&#8217;s with fairy-tale male leads.  Both accept these flat, simplified fantasies as real love.  They&#8217;re pretending they have a relationship as much as his porn clips and her rom-com&#8217;s are &#8220;the real thing.&#8221;Jon can call his porn addiction what it is &#8211; a release.  He knows those girls aren&#8217;t real.  However, Barbara, believes the rom-com&#8217;s are real.  That real men want to sacrifice everything for the woman they love.  Over the next few weeks, she becomes more tyrannical with Jon.  She wants him to earn six figures and wear a suit because it&#8217;s &#8220;hot.&#8221;  She never asks him what he really wants to do with life, she sees him as a perennial &#8220;fixer-upper.&#8221; Once Don Jon is &#8220;fixed,&#8221; he will be worthy of Barbara.Julianne Moore (Esther) is enrolled in Jon&#8217;s night class &#8211; he took the course only because Barbara drove him to it &#8211; and the two of them engage in genuine conversation.  Esther asks Jon, &#8220;Why did you take this class?&#8221;  We realize as viewers, that she&#8217;s the first character to probe beyond the surface.  She wants his real opinion.  She doesn&#8217;t immediately shame him on the porn viewing &#8211; and she doesn&#8217;t condone it, she suggests an erotica film as an alternative.  Then Esther asks, &#8220;Why?  Why do you watch these?&#8221;When Julianne Moore&#8217;s older, more ordinary character throws him for a loop, Jon starts to think outside the box he&#8217;s placed himself in&#8230; and his same routines take on a new meaning.I thought this film was outstanding &#8211; sharp, edgy, urban, funny and unexpectedly touching.  It reflects our current times, a Twitter, self-obsessed pop culture, hook-ups and emptiness.  Lots of posing &#8211; and emptiness.  It&#8217;s a great primer on how both of the sexes impose impossible standards on each other &#8211; she&#8217;s got to be a 10, he&#8217;s got to be Christian Grey. Real love is deeper.  Meaningful sex has a spiritual element.I also loved this actor &#8220;500 Days of Summer,&#8221; which I thought was tons better than the shallow rom-com&#8217;s offered today.",5,"Surprisingly Observant, Funny, Raunchy and Honest",1388793600,"01 4, 2014",2014,3305,"['Caution', 'watch', 'trailer', '8220', 'Don', 'Jon', '8221', '8217', 're', 'expecting', 'amusing', 'sex', 'romp', 'do', 'not', 'rent', 'film', 'Stick', 'crowd-pleaser', '8217', 'light', 'character', 'development', 'doesn', '8217', 'tackle', 'potential', 'darker', 'side', 'porn', 'addiction', 'romance', 'novels', 'one-dimensional', 'rom-com', '8217', 's', 'Watch', '8220', 'Hangover', '8221', '8220', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', '8221', '8220', 'Dodgeball.', '8221', 'film', 'blunt', 'graphic', 'honest', '8211', 'refreshing.The', 'cynical', 'muscle-bound', 'Jon', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'appearance', 'expletive-hurling', 'machismo', 'can', '8217', 'settle', '6', '7', '8217', 'got', 'have', '8220', 'dime', '8221', 'ten', 'world', 'girl', '8217', 'got', 'reflect', 'hotness', 'level', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Barbara', '8217', 'found', 'true', 'love', 'illusion', '8211', 'note', 'say', '8211', 'illusion', '8211', 'matches', 'up', 'box', '8217', 's', 'placed', 'great', 'folks', 'love', '8217', 's', 'Jersey-licious', 'still', 'porn', 'when', 'true', 'sexual', 'release', '8211', 'there', '8217', 's', 'control', '8211', 'sappy', 'rom-com', '8217', 's', 'fairy-tale', 'male', 'leads', 'flat', 'simplified', 'fantasies', 'real', 'love', '8217', 're', 'pretending', 'have', 'relationship', 'as', 'much', 'porn', 'clips', 'rom-com', '8217', 'are', '8220', 'real', 'thing.', '8221', 'Jon', 'can', 'call', 'porn', 'addiction', 'what', '8211', 'release', 'girls', 'aren', '8217', 't', 'real', 'However', 'Barbara', 'rom-com', '8217', 'are', 'real', 'real', 'men', 'want', 'sacrifice', 'everything', 'woman', 'love', 'next', 'few', 'weeks', 'more', 'tyrannical', 'Jon', 'earn', 'six', 'figures', 'wear', 'suit', '8217', '8220', '8221', 'never', 'what', 'really', 'do', 'life', 'perennial', '8220', 'fixer-upper.', '8221', 'Once', 'Don', 'Jon', '8220', 'fixed', '8221', 'will', 'be', 'worthy', 'Barbara.Julianne', 'Moore', 'Esther', 'enrolled', 'Jon', '8217', 'night', 'class', '8211', 'took', 'course', 'only', 'Barbara', 'drove', '8211', 'two', 'engage', 'genuine', 'conversation', 'Esther', 'Jon', '8220', 'Why', 'did', 'take', 'class', '8221', 'realize', 'viewers', '8217', 's', 'first', 'character', 'probe', 'surface', 'real', 'opinion', 'doesn', '8217', 'immediately', 'shame', 'porn', 'viewing', '8211', 'doesn', '8217', 'condone', 'erotica', 'film', 'alternative', 'Then', 'Esther', '8220', 'Why', 'Why', 'do', 'watch', '8221', 'When', 'Julianne', 'Moore', '8217', 's', 'older', 'more', 'ordinary', 'character', 'loop', 'Jon', 'think', 'box', '8217', 's', 'placed', '8230', 'same', 'routines', 'take', 'new', 'meaning.I', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'outstanding', '8211', 'sharp', 'edgy', 'urban', 'funny', 'unexpectedly', 'touching', 'current', 'times', 'Twitter', 'self-obsessed', 'pop', 'culture', 'hook-ups', 'emptiness', 'Lots', 'posing', '8211', 'emptiness', '8217', 'great', 'primer', 'how', 'sexes', 'impose', 'impossible', 'standards', 'other', '8211', '8217', 'got', 'be', '10', '8217', 'got', 'be', 'Christian', 'Grey', 'Real', 'love', 'deeper', 'Meaningful', 'sex', 'spiritual', 'element.I', 'also', 'loved', 'actor', '8220', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', '8221', 'thought', 'was', 'tons', 'better', 'shallow', 'rom-com', '8217', 'offered', 'today']",Don Jon
