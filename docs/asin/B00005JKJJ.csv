It may very well be the dumbest waste of time I have ever applied.Corky Romano is like rewinding your dvd's. It serves no purpose, and its embarassing. Jerry Lewis covered everything in this movie, with more talent, and skill, decades ago.The Plot, if I dare mention the word: a single bafoon, with a counterfiet piece of paper and a suit, announcing that he is tapped (and high, and along the way teaches a kiddie class...also high) infiltrates the F.B.I. in a matter of minutes - Its amazing what your cliche' hacker can get you from his basement when you give him a good threat and a slap in the head. Im guilty of liking goofy movies... the ""Bill and Teds"" are among them, but as a friend, which I hope you consider me to be...don't see this junk. It's a mistake, it stinks. I hate, hate, hated, it. Best of luck to Kattan.If you liked it, that's great.

I did that, but then again, there are a slew of SNL spin-off films that have carried their own weight or at least proved to be entertaining.  The problem I have with `Corky Romano' is that it just plain isn't funny; at all.  The premise is promising, in the vein of comedies of this nature, but it just doesn't deliver the goods as I had hoped it would.  I've never been a huge fan of Chris Kattan.  His breed of funny just doesn't work as well on him as it does on SNL castmate Will Ferrell.  Kattan tries too hard, and it shows.  Alas, some will like this and that is cool, but this comedy was NOT my cup of tea.  You'd be hard-pressed to find a gag or joke that lands just right; most of them flutter awkwardly to the floor.

It's a story about a family called the Romanos who also happened to be the mob.  The FBI has everyone on file:-""Pops"" Romano, Father and the leader-Paulie Romano, oldest son, good with a knife, and he can't read.-Peter Romano, youngest son, the muscle in the family, and homosexual-Leo Carrigan, Pop's right hand man.The FBI has everthing they need to send the Romanos in the slammer but when Pops all have sudden gets sick, the FBI has to wait until he gets better.  The only way for the mob to get out of this mess is send somebody to pose as an FBI agent to get rid of the evidence that the FBI holds.  The only guy they have in mind is a family member who the FBI doesn't have on file, the family who really is Pop's youngest kid, the family member who didn't even know his family was the mob.  And that guy is Corky Romano.  But the only problem is, is that Corky happens to be a dork, there are times when he even acts like a kid, he never stands up for himself.  As Corky goes undercover as an FBI agent, he somehow accidently does stuff that makes him the #1 FBI guy.  He is being so famous in the FBI that he cannot seem to get enough time to steal the evidence against his family.  You""ll through all zany messes Corky goes through and what happens in the outcomes of these messes.  The movie is a little stupid but still good.

In the case of Chris Kattan's performance in ""Corky Romano"" you can throw desperation into the mix. For better or for worse this is Kattan's baby and the fortunes of the film rise and fall with his work.  At times he can be manic and cloying and at other times he's brilliant and endearing.  It seems as though Kattan is somewhat overwhelmed by the fact that he's headlining a motion picture.  He might also be intimidated by having a talented supporting cast that includes legends like Peter Falk and Richard Roundtree and seasoned pros like Chris Penn and Peter Berg.  It was probably also daunting to have a love interest as uber-hot as Vinessa Shaw fresh from a plum role in Stanley Kubrick's final film, ""Eyes Wide Shut"".  The film also has plot holes you can drive a Mack truck through.  It's a stretch to think a doofus like Corky could infiltrate the FBI even in pre 9-11 days. It's a real suspension of belief when his comrades at the bureau mistake his foul-ups as part of some master plan.  Reality Alert!!!  This is a brainless comedy not ""Citizen Kane""!  ""Corky Romano"" works on it's owned skewed ragged terms snobs be damned.  It might be trite and it may be predicatable but by the end credits you'll find yourself smiling and even caring about these characters.  Kattan has some really amusing scenes.  I liked the scene where he tries to euthanize an obese cat.  The standout bit here though is one where he tries to wrangle a kilo of confiscated cocaine from a drug-sniffing dog and he gets smothered with white powder.  Afterwards he has to give a lecture to a group of second-graders while on a contact high.

My star rating is an assessment of the product overall, which may not reflect my personal enjoyment of the main content.Version of Corky Romano Reviewed: Touchstone Entertainment Widescreen DVD, 2003ABOUT THE FILMThe Premise:  Corky Romano (Chris Kattan) is the black sheep son in a dysfunctional, quirky mafia family.  He's not a fan of the family business--he's much more concerned with animals (he's an assistant veterinarian), helping people, and spreading good cheer and hugs (think of a less &quot;flamboyant&quot; version of Richard Simmons).  Because of this, after his mother passed away, his father (Peter Falk) and brothers (Peter Berg and Chris Penn) disowned him.  However, when the family business is threatened by an informant working with the FBI, they need someone whom they can trust, but who isn't a known link to the family, to pose as an FBI agent and find out what they know and how they know it.  Corky is unwillingly recruited for the job.Facts And Assessments To Help You Decide Whether You Might Like This Film:This is a fish-out-of-water comedy, and more specifically, would fit into a &quot;Saturday Night Live comedy&quot; genre.  The Saturday Night Live comedy genre, with Kattan being the formal link to Saturday Night Live here, usually plays something like a film-length skit from the show, with more expensive production values, and a more formally structured plot.  Although a lot of the humor can be sophomoric (which isn't meant as a value judgment--a lot of people, including me, enjoy sophomoric humor), Saturday Night Live comedies often have more sophisticated comedic subtexts, too.  Corky Romano is heavier on the sophomoric and slapstick side.Fans of the genre, and especially Chris Kattan fans, are most likely to enjoy the film.  If some of Kattan's work on Saturday Night Live could get on your nerves, you may quickly grow tired of him in the film.  If you're primarily interested in Corky Romano because you like other actors in the film, such as Peter Falk, be aware that besides Kattan, most of the other roles are more like &quot;bit parts&quot;.ABOUT THE DISCCompared to a lot of recent releases, Corky Romano is a bit slim on special features.  There are two &quot;extended scenes&quot;, each only a few minutes long.  One was definitely an alternate take.  The other may have just been edited.  In my view, both of these were even funnier than the versions that ended up in the final cut--this can be either positive (in that it's quality material as an extra) or a negative (in that it makes you realize that the film could have been even funnier), depending on how you look at it.If you are interested in the process of filmmaking, the best extra feature for you would be the &quot;All Access&quot; extra, which is about 10 minutes long.  Although there is no narration to explain what is going on, you see video footage of the director, cast and crew at work doing multiple takes of one particular scene.  This will help you understand the idea of shooting &quot;coverage&quot;, and implicitly demonstrate the importance of post-production sound processing, editing, and the strong effect that the addition of a score has on a film. On a positive/negative note again, much of the material that was cut out of this scene in the final version of the film was funnier to me.Unfortunately, there is no commentary track provided, and this is one of the many discs where the box art lists items such as &quot;Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound&quot;, &quot;Widescreen (1.85:1)&quot;, and &quot;Spanish and French Subtitles&quot; as &quot;Special Features&quot;, in order to make the disc look more substantial.  Also, when navigating the menus, one of which is amusingly animated (and again this has the unintended negative effect of making you notice that the other menus aren't animated), they included a special section for a sole trailer for another film, Bubble Boy, as if that were some outstanding special feature.",3,Product Guide,1073088000,"01 3, 2004",2004,4158,"['Note', 'review', 'intended', 'product', 'guide', 'help', 'decide', 'should', 'make', 'purchase', 'applicable', 'particular', 'version', 'product', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'star', 'rating', 'assessment', 'product', 'overall', 'may', 'not', 'reflect', 'personal', 'enjoyment', 'main', 'content.Version', 'Corky', 'Romano', 'Reviewed', 'Touchstone', 'Entertainment', 'Widescreen', 'DVD', '2003ABOUT', 'THE', 'FILMThe', 'Premise', 'Corky', 'Romano', 'Chris', 'Kattan', 'black', 'sheep', 'son', 'dysfunctional', 'quirky', 'mafia', 'family', 'not', 'fan', 'family', 'business', 'much', 'more', 'concerned', 'animals', 'assistant', 'veterinarian', 'helping', 'people', 'spreading', 'good', 'cheer', 'hugs', 'think', 'less', 'quot', 'flamboyant', 'quot', 'version', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'mother', 'passed', 'away', 'father', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'brothers', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'Chris', 'Penn', 'disowned', 'However', 'when', 'family', 'business', 'threatened', 'informant', 'working', 'FBI', 'need', 'someone', 'whom', 'can', 'trust', 'who', ""n't"", 'known', 'link', 'family', 'pose', 'FBI', 'agent', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'know', 'how', 'know', 'Corky', 'unwillingly', 'recruited', 'job.Facts', 'Assessments', 'Help', 'Decide', 'Whether', 'Might', 'Film', 'fish-out-of-water', 'comedy', 'more', 'specifically', 'would', 'fit', 'quot', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'comedy', 'quot', 'genre', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'comedy', 'genre', 'Kattan', 'being', 'formal', 'link', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'here', 'usually', 'something', 'film-length', 'skit', 'show', 'more', 'expensive', 'production', 'values', 'more', 'formally', 'structured', 'plot', 'lot', 'humor', 'can', 'be', 'sophomoric', ""n't"", 'meant', 'value', 'judgment', 'lot', 'people', 'including', 'enjoy', 'sophomoric', 'humor', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'comedies', 'often', 'have', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'comedic', 'subtexts', 'too', 'Corky', 'Romano', 'heavier', 'sophomoric', 'slapstick', 'side.Fans', 'genre', 'especially', 'Chris', 'Kattan', 'fans', 'are', 'most', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Kattan', 'work', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'could', 'get', 'nerves', 'may', 'quickly', 'grow', 'tired', 'film', ""'re"", 'primarily', 'interested', 'Corky', 'Romano', 'other', 'actors', 'film', 'such', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'be', 'aware', 'Kattan', 'most', 'other', 'roles', 'are', 'more', 'quot', 'bit', 'parts', 'quot', 'DISCCompared', 'lot', 'recent', 'releases', 'Corky', 'Romano', 'bit', 'slim', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'two', 'quot', 'extended', 'scenes', 'quot', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'long', 'One', 'was', 'definitely', 'alternate', 'take', 'other', 'may', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'edited', 'view', 'were', 'even', 'funnier', 'versions', 'ended', 'up', 'final', 'cut', 'can', 'be', 'either', 'positive', 'quality', 'material', 'extra', 'negative', 'realize', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'funnier', 'depending', 'how', 'look', 'it.If', 'are', 'interested', 'process', 'filmmaking', 'best', 'extra', 'feature', 'would', 'be', 'quot', 'All', 'Access', 'quot', '10', 'minutes', 'long', 'narration', 'explain', 'what', 'going', 'see', 'video', 'footage', 'director', 'cast', 'crew', 'work', 'doing', 'multiple', 'one', 'particular', 'scene', 'will', 'help', 'understand', 'idea', 'shooting', 'quot', 'coverage', 'quot', 'implicitly', 'demonstrate', 'importance', 'post-production', 'sound', 'processing', 'editing', 'strong', 'effect', 'addition', 'score', 'film', 'positive/negative', 'note', 'again', 'much', 'material', 'was', 'cut', 'scene', 'final', 'version', 'film', 'was', 'funnier', 'me.Unfortunately', 'commentary', 'track', 'provided', 'one', 'many', 'discs', 'where', 'box', 'art', 'items', 'such', 'quot', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'Surround', 'Sound', 'quot', 'quot', 'Widescreen', '1.85:1', 'quot', 'quot', 'Spanish', 'French', 'Subtitles', 'quot', 'quot', 'Special', 'Features', 'quot', 'order', 'make', 'disc', 'look', 'more', 'substantial', 'Also', 'when', 'navigating', 'menus', 'one', 'amusingly', 'animated', 'again', 'unintended', 'negative', 'effect', 'making', 'notice', 'other', 'menus', 'are', ""n't"", 'animated', 'included', 'special', 'section', 'sole', 'trailer', 'film', 'Bubble', 'Boy', 'were', 'outstanding', 'special', 'feature']",Corky Romano

Just buy this one, and enjoy yourself.The fact is &quot;Corky Romano&quot; is so awful that it is a kind of perverse fun for non-Kattan devotees.  It is about a guy &quot;Corky&quot; Romano, a vet, who happens to have once been a member in a mob family, but now is kicked out of the circle because he is too unsuitable for the family business.  But as now they need a guy who has to be an undercover FBI agent (!) for some reason I forgot, they recruit him again and dress him up with FBI uniform.  But he is so terribly inept that nobody realizes his true identity; instead, they think he is a first-rate investigator who has his own method of cracking a case.The premise is funny, and it kind of worked in such films like &quot;Blue Streak,&quot; but in &quot;Romano&quot; Chris Kattan is reduced to very limited capacity of making laughs: worst kind of slapsticks -- he is always wiggling his arms, screaming and sniveling, for more than 1 hour.  If this is not a film about Shakespeare, it doesn't mean that the film needs no character or reasonable situations because the movie is, unlike sketches of TV program, a piece of work through which audience must sit in the dark.  But if you get a DVD, then it's alright.  Just stop whereever you want.  Even though the gags are all unimaginative and too predictable.If this film stopped there ... but the film commits a great crime in casting veterans like Peter Falk and Richard Roundtree, whose names should be much more respected here.  Falk, fondly remembered as Columbo, plays the boss of the mob, but isn't allowed to do nothing; and the hero of 70s blaxploitation films Roundtree is made to praise Romano character every time he commits stupidity (like his brandishing a firing machine-gun in a crime scene) so that great Shaft looks like a real fool.

I did not have much hope for it since lately, whenever an SNL star goes off and does something on their own, it seems to be a total a complete failure that just humiliates themselves and the show to a maximum.Well, Chris Kattan does a great job here.  He's fresh and quirky.  There are not many people in Hollywood that can pull of humor like this, and Kattan does a brilliant job.The movie has a strong script with a strong supporting cast.  I didn't much care for Peter Falk's character, but everyone else was very well played.  There were many one-liners that caught you off guard.I don't give it five stars because the film did take a long time to get going and at the end it kind of dropped off.

587408,A254Z4O7ORVL6U,B00005JKJJ,wellwellwell,"[0, 0]","In a movie that combines unintelligent comedy with the FBI, Chris Kattan gives a performance that you'll either love or hate.  Most popular for his roles on SNL (Mango, Mr. Peepers), Kattan might just wear out his welcome midway into the movie.  `Corky Romano' seemed to be a theater blockbuster back in 2001, though it is really nothing we haven't seen before.  The cast is pretty limited as Kattan is really the only one who shines; but Peter Falk and Chris Penn do allow for some good laughs in their supporting roles.  I was not very impressed with the film as a whole.  I found it to be reminiscent of a `Naked Gun' movie, but with more seriousness.  Playing the title character, Kattan fumbles around for 85 minutes of supposed-to-be comedy.  Some parts were hilarious, while others were down-right dumb.  Still, it's the few amusing parts that make this movie watch-able.The story is based on the character of Corky, who is a forgotten son in a infamous mafia family.  When the family comes upon hard times, with their father (Peter Falk) set up for jail, they ask Corky to go undercover and steal the evidence that would convict him.  The entire script is weakly developed; as Corky, who is an assistant veterinarian, is allowed to become an FBI agent with, seemingly, no questions asked.  As I said, all Kattan does is fumble around and act stupid; while somehow becoming famous for solving cases and catching criminals.  Even with a dismal story and poor casting, Kattan does manage to bring some laughs to the screen.  His fake FBI name is Agent Pissante (it's French, but everyone likes to pronounce it pxss-ant).  The fact that one of his brothers is gay and the other can't read is also silly, but I did enjoy the part where Corky tried to compare his [gay] brother to Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer.  As you probably know from watching Kattan on TV's Saturday Night Live, he brings his own blend of comedy to the screen.  That comedy is certainly an acquired taste, and it's very hard to attain a liking here. If you find his SNL characters Mr. Peepers or Mango to be stupid, you won't like this movie.  It almost seems like `Corky Romano' is aimed at teenage girls who smirk and snicker over anything.  In spite of everything bad I`ve said about this movie, it's still somewhat enjoyable.  If you like those `Dumb & Dumber' (but dumber) or SNL-type movies, there's a good chance you'll enjoy this one.I gave this movie 3 stars because I think it was worth my time.  However, I probably won't watch it again (any time soon).  There were some good one-liners (i.e. the groovy tie club excerpt, the Matthew Perry poster, the ""we could all take a page out of Pissante's book"" quote), but overall the humor was rather one-dimensional.  The music put the movie was also daft and clich&eacute;; ""We're Not Gonna Take It"" was playing when the family comes to rescue Corky.  I don't know if there's a soundtrack, but if there is don't buy it.  As for the ending, I think it was fitting.  I won't ruin it for you.  Anyways, `Corky Romano' is not all it's cracked up to be.  It's a bad twist on FBI-related films and not as good as `A Night At The Roxbury' or even the `Naked Gun' series.  This film is the epitome of helpless, slapstick comedy and is definitely not for everyone.  SNL fans will probably enjoy it, but if you flip the channel when Mango appears, you'll almost certainly dislike this movie.",3,SNL diehards beware,1049673600,"04 7, 2003",2003,3411,"['movie', 'unintelligent', 'comedy', 'FBI', 'Chris', 'Kattan', 'performance', ""'ll"", 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'Most', 'popular', 'roles', 'SNL', 'Mango', 'Mr.', 'Peepers', 'Kattan', 'might', 'just', 'wear', 'out', 'welcome', 'midway', 'movie', 'Corky', 'Romano', 'seemed', 'be', 'theater', 'blockbuster', 'back', '2001', 'really', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'cast', 'pretty', 'limited', 'Kattan', 'really', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'Chris', 'Penn', 'do', 'allow', 'good', 'laughs', 'supporting', 'roles', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'impressed', 'film', 'whole', 'found', 'be', 'reminiscent', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'movie', 'more', 'seriousness', 'Playing', 'title', 'character', 'Kattan', '85', 'minutes', 'supposed-to-be', 'comedy', 'parts', 'were', 'hilarious', 'others', 'were', 'down-right', 'dumb', 'Still', 'few', 'amusing', 'parts', 'make', 'movie', 'watch-able.The', 'story', 'based', 'character', 'Corky', 'who', 'forgotten', 'son', 'infamous', 'mafia', 'family', 'When', 'family', 'upon', 'hard', 'times', 'father', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'set', 'up', 'jail', 'ask', 'Corky', 'go', 'undercover', 'steal', 'evidence', 'would', 'convict', 'entire', 'script', 'weakly', 'developed', 'Corky', 'who', 'assistant', 'veterinarian', 'allowed', 'become', 'FBI', 'agent', 'seemingly', 'questions', 'asked', 'said', 'Kattan', 'fumble', 'act', 'stupid', 'somehow', 'becoming', 'famous', 'solving', 'cases', 'catching', 'criminals', 'Even', 'dismal', 'story', 'poor', 'casting', 'Kattan', 'manage', 'bring', 'laughs', 'screen', 'fake', 'FBI', 'name', 'Agent', 'Pissante', 'French', 'everyone', 'likes', 'pronounce', 'pxss-ant', 'fact', 'one', 'brothers', 'gay', 'other', 'ca', ""n't"", 'read', 'also', 'silly', 'did', 'enjoy', 'part', 'where', 'Corky', 'tried', 'compare', '[', 'gay', 'brother', 'Rudolph', 'red-nosed', 'reindeer', 'probably', 'know', 'watching', 'Kattan', 'TV', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'own', 'blend', 'comedy', 'screen', 'comedy', 'certainly', 'acquired', 'taste', 'very', 'hard', 'attain', 'liking', 'here', 'find', 'SNL', 'characters', 'Mr.', 'Peepers', 'Mango', 'be', 'stupid', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'almost', 'Corky', 'Romano', 'aimed', 'teenage', 'girls', 'who', 'smirk', 'snicker', 'anything', 'spite', 'everything', 'bad', 've', 'said', 'movie', 'still', 'somewhat', 'enjoyable', 'like', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'dumber', 'SNL-type', 'movies', 'good', 'chance', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'one.I', 'gave', 'movie', '3', 'stars', 'think', 'was', 'worth', 'time', 'However', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'again', 'time', 'soon', 'were', 'good', 'one-liners', 'i.e', 'groovy', 'tie', 'club', 'excerpt', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'poster', 'could', 'take', 'page', 'Pissante', 'book', 'quote', 'humor', 'was', 'rather', 'one-dimensional', 'music', 'put', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'daft', 'clich', 'eacute', ""'re"", 'Not', 'Gon', 'Take', 'was', 'playing', 'when', 'family', 'rescue', 'Corky', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'soundtrack', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'ending', 'think', 'was', 'fitting', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'Anyways', 'Corky', 'Romano', 'not', 'cracked', 'up', 'be', 'bad', 'twist', 'FBI-related', 'films', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Night', 'Roxbury', 'even', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'series', 'film', 'epitome', 'helpless', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'definitely', 'not', 'everyone', 'SNL', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'flip', 'channel', 'when', 'Mango', ""'ll"", 'almost', 'certainly', 'dislike', 'movie']",Corky Romano

His manic posturing, his wide eyed stares, his innocent, well meaning klutz stance all serves him well in this sometimes over the top comedy with a preposturous premise on how a gangland family has the 'nice' vetinarian son infiltrate the FBI in order to grab hold of the pater familias' record on a series of mob related incidences. The FBI has taken to Py-ssahnt's penchant for wearing obnoxious ties and flubbing his way thru serious undercover assignments. His co-stars Falk, Penn, et al, seem to be enjoying themselves in this comedy. It's big fun for folks who don't mind laughing at something in this vein.
