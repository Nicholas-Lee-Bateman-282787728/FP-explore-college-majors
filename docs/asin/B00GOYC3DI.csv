1680003,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00GOYC3DI,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[9, 10]","When I sat down to watch SORORITY PARTY MASSACRE, I expected it to be bad. But I expected it to be FUN bad. Campy, gory, gratuitously nudey, tongue-in-cheek bad. The kind of bad that you and your friends can get a kick out of. MST3K bad.Not so.This movie IS bad, but in a bad way. It is bad because it fails to fully deliver any of the things you might expect, and it is generally so ineptly done that it becomes annoying even just to pay attention to it. Let me explain.#1: The intended audience here is obviously young, horny guys. Too bad for them. The T&A; is negligible at best. You'd get more skin looking at a JCPenny underwear catalog. Also, it is quite clear that NONE of these girls belong to a sorority. Most of them look like they're in their 30s. One of them is quite clearly 40-something. I'm not saying older women can't be sexy, and I'm not saying that a movie has to have nudity to be good. I'm saying a movie entitled SORORITY PARTY MASSACRE generally leads its audience to expect titillation of a certain type, and there is none of that here. None.#2: The ""massacre"" is bush-league at best. Aside from an opening that is halfway-decent only because it shamelessly rips off the first SCREAM film, there is no real attempt at the kinds of gory SFX that movies with ""massacre"" in the title tend to have in spades. Instead, you've got maybe half a barrel of corn syrup and a ton of hasty, horribly edited cut-aways at the moment something scary or brutal is supposed to happen.#3: The movie IS funny in that baffling, partially intended way that you might expect, but the comedy is spotty. The story, regrettably, ends up taking itself seriously by the end, and as the movie limps and shuffles along, the gags and self-referential moments grow shorter and rarer. It could've been a not-entirely-wasted experience had the flick not tried so weakly to also be scary and sexy when it should've just banked on its complete lunacy.#4: Technically, the film is a nightmare. The soundtrack thinks it's a lot better than it is, and the volume of the dialogue and score is uneven. If you turn your sound up to hear the mumbled, barely coherent dialogue, keep the remote in your hand, because you WILL be walloped with a blast of sound when the music blares out of nowhere and for no reason, as happens approximately 76 times. Include an overly complex plot and a weird stab at backstory that comes out of left field, as well as horrendous make-up, costuming, and a total inability to frame most scenes or provide establishing shots, and you've got a movie that is hard to understand simply because you can't see or hear most of what's really going on.So, a warning: you might think this film would be a fun, silly way to relive the 80's slasher-era sexy-serial-killer-romps, but you're better off just getting one of those old flicks instead of trying to relive them through this garbage.",1,Where's The M(ass)acre?,1392681600,"02 18, 2014",2014,2894,"['When', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'SORORITY', 'PARTY', 'MASSACRE', 'expected', 'be', 'bad', 'expected', 'be', 'FUN', 'bad', 'Campy', 'gory', 'gratuitously', 'nudey', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'bad', 'kind', 'bad', 'friends', 'can', 'get', 'kick', 'MST3K', 'bad.Not', 'so.This', 'movie', 'IS', 'bad', 'bad', 'way', 'bad', 'fully', 'deliver', 'things', 'might', 'expect', 'generally', 'so', 'ineptly', 'done', 'annoying', 'even', 'just', 'pay', 'attention', 'Let', 'explain.', '1', 'intended', 'audience', 'here', 'obviously', 'young', 'horny', 'guys', 'Too', 'bad', 'T', 'A', 'negligible', 'best', ""'d"", 'get', 'more', 'skin', 'looking', 'JCPenny', 'underwear', 'catalog', 'Also', 'quite', 'clear', 'NONE', 'girls', 'belong', 'sorority', 'Most', 'look', ""'re"", '30s', 'One', 'quite', 'clearly', '40-something', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'older', 'women', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'sexy', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'movie', 'have', 'nudity', 'be', 'good', ""'m"", 'saying', 'movie', 'entitled', 'SORORITY', 'PARTY', 'MASSACRE', 'generally', 'audience', 'expect', 'titillation', 'certain', 'type', 'none', 'here', 'None.', '2', 'massacre', 'bush-league', 'best', 'Aside', 'opening', 'halfway-decent', 'only', 'shamelessly', 'first', 'SCREAM', 'film', 'real', 'attempt', 'kinds', 'gory', 'SFX', 'movies', 'massacre', 'title', 'tend', 'have', 'spades', 'Instead', ""'ve"", 'got', 'maybe', 'barrel', 'corn', 'syrup', 'ton', 'hasty', 'horribly', 'edited', 'cut-aways', 'moment', 'something', 'scary', 'brutal', 'supposed', 'happen.', '3', 'movie', 'IS', 'funny', 'baffling', 'partially', 'intended', 'way', 'might', 'expect', 'comedy', 'spotty', 'story', 'regrettably', 'up', 'taking', 'seriously', 'end', 'movie', 'limps', 'shuffles', 'along', 'gags', 'self-referential', 'moments', 'grow', 'shorter', 'rarer', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'not-entirely-wasted', 'experience', 'had', 'flick', 'not', 'tried', 'so', 'weakly', 'also', 'be', 'scary', 'sexy', 'when', 'should', ""'ve"", 'just', 'banked', 'complete', 'lunacy.', '4', 'Technically', 'film', 'nightmare', 'soundtrack', 'lot', 'better', 'volume', 'dialogue', 'score', 'uneven', 'turn', 'sound', 'up', 'hear', 'mumbled', 'barely', 'coherent', 'dialogue', 'keep', 'remote', 'hand', 'WILL', 'be', 'walloped', 'blast', 'sound', 'when', 'music', 'nowhere', 'reason', 'happens', 'approximately', '76', 'times', 'Include', 'overly', 'complex', 'plot', 'weird', 'stab', 'backstory', 'left', 'field', 'as', 'well', 'horrendous', 'make-up', 'costuming', 'total', 'inability', 'frame', 'most', 'scenes', 'provide', 'establishing', 'shots', ""'ve"", 'got', 'movie', 'hard', 'understand', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'hear', 'most', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'on.So', 'warning', 'might', 'think', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'silly', 'way', 'relive', '80', 'slasher-era', 'sexy-serial-killer-romps', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'just', 'getting', 'one', 'old', 'flicks', 'instead', 'trying', 'relive', 'garbage']",Sorority Party Massacre

SORORITY PARTY MASSACRE combines all three aspects, and the result is a fun and humorous slasher.  And just like the title suggests, there&#8217;s plenty of bodies to go around!Ok, confession time:  I didn&#8217;t realize this was a horror-comedy until about 20 minutes in to the film.  I honestly thought it was supposed to be serious horror&#8230;even with Ron Jeremy&#8217;s name in the credits!  But, once I realized what it was, the film was much easier to enjoy.SORORITY PARTY MASSACRE is one of those films that is perfect to watch with a group of friends.  I found myself laughing at certain scenes and then yelling at the characters to warn them in the next; while not a perfect or high budget film, it is still entertaining and immersive, a movie that you and your friends will enjoy yelling at together.The acting is pretty good and the titular ladies in the film are all beautiful.  I particularly like how the casting crew found so many different types of personalities to play the leads.  From butch and powerful to cunning and petite, each girl brings a different persona to the table.  And as a result, the cat fights are almost as much fun to watch as the killings.The special effects are not bad however we don&#8217;t get to see too much carnage.  Even in a horror-comedy, I still enjoy a nice dose of gore.  There are some nice shots of a bee-sting victim and even some grisly acid burn effects&#8230;but there could have been sooooo much more as well.  Still, this is not a huge detractor, but more of a personal preference.The story in SORORITY PARTY MASSACRE is pretty good as well, although a couple of the twists are just thrown in for comedic effect.  Since this film does not take itself too seriously, they work well for the plot and are fun to see unfold.  My sole complaint about the plot is that some of it is left unexplained, although it&#8217;s nothing that will keep you up at night.SORORITY PARTY MASSACRE is a fun, low-key film that fans of horror-comedies should enjoy.  I recommend it, although I can tell you right now that this won&#8217;t be for everyone.
