We dragged grandma along. Seeing them again brought back more than just memories of the films themselves. They are very pleasant, realistic live-action movies, with enough adventure and gentle peril to keep them interesting. The family label does not mean saccharin or boring, however. Their message of protecting wildlife and ecology are perhaps more relevant today than when they were made in the early-mid 60's. Two for one packaging at a reduced price is also great.

This is the disc to buy if you take an interest in the stories.Luke Halpin stars in both films as Sandy Ricks, the Florida Keys teen who befriends a dolphin, Flipper.In ""Flipper"", Sandy's father, Porter Ricks, is having a tough time as a fisherman.  Between Red Tide and hurricane damage, cash is tight.  Setting the stage, Porter tells Sandy the ancient Greek legend of a dolphin rescuing a boy named Arion from the sea.  While Porter is away, Sandy goes spearfishing with some friends.  When Flipper and one spearfisher each get injured, Sandy helps out.  When Porter returns, friendly Flipper is doing tricks for Sandy.  Is Flipper a devourer of Ricks family income?  Does the Arion story get reenacted?  Is Flipper a keeper?  The movie goes to its expected happy ending.The movie and the resultant TV series were so popular that ""Flipper's New Adventure"" was created.  The state of Florida has plans to develop the area.  Flipper has to go.  Sandy decides to flee in a motorboat, to accompany Flipper out into nearby Caribbean island waters.  The two find a deserted island paradise.  Then a group of escaped criminals hijack a large sailboat, marooning three English women on the island.  Sandy makes cautious friends with Penny Hopewell (played by Pamela Franklin), while keeping hidden from the others.  Then the criminals sail back.  What can Flipper and Sandy do?  There is another happy ending.These are both enjoyable family movies.

947653,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B000BPL2G0,Mark Baker,"[19, 20]","Before the dolphin Flipper became a TV show, he started out with two movies.  This two sided disc contains both of the films made before the TV show began.First up is ""Flipper.""  This movie tells us the story of how Flipper and Sandy Ricks (Luke Halpin) became friends.  It all started with a hurricane that hit the island in the Florida Keys were Sandy lives with his mother and fisherman father.  While his father is getting his boat fixed, Sandy and a friend find an injured dolphin.  Sandy nurses him back to health, and the two become friends.Frankly, this movie suffered from the problem I often have with pilots, it spent so long getting the main characters into place that the resulting story was slow and boring.  Still, there were some fun scenes that made me smile and laugh.  I found it most interesting that Luke Halpin was the only actor from this movie to make it to the series.Side two contains ""Flipper's New Adventure,"" a much better movie.  While Porter Ricks (Brian Kelly taking on the role) is away training for a new job, Sandy gets the news that their home is being reclaimed by the government.  Fearing that he will lose Flipper, Sandy sets out in a boat to find a deserted island where they can live.  Unfortunately for Sandy, the island soon becomes the home of three castaways sent their by escaped convicts.This movie had a couple slow parts, but on the whole it moved much faster.  There were lots of great dolphin scenes in this one.  And the climax is truly thrilling.  This movie also serves as a nice transition between the first and the TV series as it sets up several things that had changed between the two.As I mentioned, this is a two sided disc.  Each side contains one movie and the original trailers for both films.  Each side is supposed to have a Tom and Jerry short as well.  While the one on side A works, I couldn't even find the one for side B.  That was a little disappointing, but since I've never been a huge fan of the duo, it didn't bug me too much.This disc is worth getting for the second film.  Frankly, I can imagine kids, especially those who love animals, enjoying both films.",4,"""They Call Him Flipper""",1203638400,"02 22, 2008",2008,2134,"['dolphin', 'Flipper', 'became', 'TV', 'show', 'started', 'out', 'two', 'movies', 'two', 'sided', 'disc', 'contains', 'films', 'made', 'TV', 'show', 'up', 'Flipper', 'movie', 'story', 'how', 'Flipper', 'Sandy', 'Ricks', 'Luke', 'Halpin', 'became', 'friends', 'started', 'hurricane', 'hit', 'island', 'Florida', 'Keys', 'were', 'Sandy', 'mother', 'fisherman', 'father', 'father', 'getting', 'boat', 'fixed', 'Sandy', 'friend', 'find', 'injured', 'dolphin', 'Sandy', 'back', 'health', 'two', 'become', 'friends.Frankly', 'movie', 'suffered', 'problem', 'often', 'have', 'pilots', 'spent', 'so', 'long', 'getting', 'main', 'characters', 'place', 'resulting', 'story', 'was', 'slow', 'boring', 'Still', 'were', 'fun', 'scenes', 'made', 'smile', 'laugh', 'found', 'most', 'interesting', 'Luke', 'Halpin', 'was', 'only', 'actor', 'movie', 'make', 'series.Side', 'two', 'Flipper', 'New', 'Adventure', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'Porter', 'Ricks', 'Brian', 'Kelly', 'taking', 'role', 'away', 'training', 'new', 'job', 'Sandy', 'news', 'home', 'being', 'reclaimed', 'government', 'Fearing', 'will', 'lose', 'Flipper', 'Sandy', 'out', 'boat', 'find', 'deserted', 'island', 'where', 'can', 'live', 'Unfortunately', 'Sandy', 'island', 'soon', 'home', 'three', 'castaways', 'sent', 'escaped', 'convicts.This', 'movie', 'had', 'couple', 'slow', 'parts', 'whole', 'moved', 'much', 'faster', 'were', 'lots', 'great', 'dolphin', 'scenes', 'one', 'climax', 'truly', 'thrilling', 'movie', 'also', 'nice', 'transition', 'first', 'TV', 'series', 'up', 'several', 'things', 'had', 'changed', 'two.As', 'mentioned', 'two', 'sided', 'disc', 'side', 'one', 'movie', 'original', 'trailers', 'films', 'side', 'supposed', 'have', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'short', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'side', 'A', 'works', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'find', 'one', 'side', 'B', 'was', 'little', 'disappointing', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'duo', 'did', ""n't"", 'bug', 'too', 'much.This', 'disc', 'worth', 'getting', 'second', 'film', 'Frankly', 'can', 'imagine', 'kids', 'especially', 'who', 'love', 'animals', 'enjoying', 'films']",Flipper / Flipper's New Adventure
