1115672,A235JN9A0V2DPI,B000Y01X9I,cdg_orders,"[49, 52]","THE ANNUNCIATION sends twelve-year-old Adam on an existential odyssey through time and space. He becomes a general in Athens, a crusader in Byzantium, Danton during the French Revolution, and a witness to plague and poverty in London. As guided by a deceptively sweet, ultimately contemptuous Lucifer, Adam confronts an endless procession of rapists and concubines, betrayal and savagery, mindless cruelty and fanaticism. Superbly photographed, colorfully costumed and stunningly acted, THE ANNUNCIATION makes Pasolini-like use of its youthful cast to illustrate the horror and irrationality of our times.Viewers beware there is a lot of nudity in this movie (most of it is during the first part and towards the end). The choice for Eve was right on and she and Adam did a fine acting job. As a matter of fact, many of the child actors put on great performances.",4,THE ANNUNCIATION - Updated review,1224806400,"10 24, 2008",2008,862,"['ANNUNCIATION', 'twelve-year-old', 'Adam', 'existential', 'odyssey', 'time', 'space', 'general', 'Athens', 'crusader', 'Byzantium', 'Danton', 'French', 'Revolution', 'witness', 'plague', 'poverty', 'London', 'guided', 'deceptively', 'sweet', 'ultimately', 'contemptuous', 'Lucifer', 'Adam', 'endless', 'procession', 'rapists', 'concubines', 'betrayal', 'savagery', 'mindless', 'cruelty', 'fanaticism', 'Superbly', 'photographed', 'colorfully', 'costumed', 'stunningly', 'acted', 'ANNUNCIATION', 'Pasolini-like', 'use', 'youthful', 'cast', 'illustrate', 'horror', 'irrationality', 'times.Viewers', 'beware', 'lot', 'nudity', 'movie', 'most', 'first', 'part', 'end', 'choice', 'Eve', 'was', 'right', 'Adam', 'did', 'fine', 'acting', 'job', 'matter', 'fact', 'many', 'child', 'actors', 'put', 'great', 'performances']",The Annunciation

Or have you ever tried to run in a dream, feels like your running in place and getting no where, no matter how hard you try running in a dream never works.Now to include all this into a movie is good but to have all the people in the movie being under the age of 18, now that really impressed me! This movie has the best dream sequence I have ever seen in any movies.The warning about movie is there is nudity in it but some of it made since to me, acording to story adam and eve were nude in the garden of eden so to make them nude in the garden made the movie come more alive to me.The things I either didn't get or didn't like was I didn't understand why all the people in this movie were kids, either it's to show that were all kids in the eyes of God or it's because the creator of this movie enjoyed kids. The second was I didn't understand why they were nude in the final part of the movie, I could understand it in the garden of eden but the story says they were ashamned of their nudity after that and covered up. I thought it was going a little over board on the nudity. Thes things are why it got 4 stars and not 5Overall this was a very good movie and was well acted and I am happy to own it.",4,Werrid but good,1260748800,"12 14, 2009",2009,1520,"['Have', 'ever', 'one', 'dreams', 'where', 'everyone', 'was', 'acting', 'very', 'strange', 'doing', 'unnormal', 'things', 'reason', 'turn', 'head', 'look', 'back', 'everyone', 'doing', 'something', 'different', 'group', 'people', 'are', 'gone', 'new', 'people', 'are', 'there', 'doing', 'something', 'totaly', 'different', 'have', 'ever', 'tried', 'run', 'dream', 'feels', 'running', 'place', 'getting', 'where', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'try', 'running', 'dream', 'never', 'include', 'movie', 'good', 'have', 'people', 'movie', 'being', 'age', '18', 'now', 'really', 'impressed', 'movie', 'best', 'dream', 'sequence', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'movies.The', 'warning', 'movie', 'nudity', 'made', 'acording', 'story', 'adam', 'eve', 'were', 'nude', 'garden', 'eden', 'so', 'make', 'nude', 'garden', 'made', 'movie', 'come', 'more', 'alive', 'me.The', 'things', 'either', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'movie', 'were', 'kids', 'show', 'were', 'kids', 'eyes', 'God', 'creator', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'kids', 'second', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'were', 'nude', 'final', 'part', 'movie', 'could', 'understand', 'garden', 'eden', 'story', 'were', 'ashamned', 'nudity', 'covered', 'up', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'little', 'over', 'board', 'nudity', 'Thes', 'things', 'are', 'why', 'got', '4', 'stars', 'not', '5Overall', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'acted', 'am', 'happy', 'own']",The Annunciation

1115677,AP1W4AXZPI4KE,B000Y01X9I,TheShadow,"[6, 7]","I bought this film mainly for the Biblical message.  For that it was fairly well done.  It went along with the Bible for the most part but some of the acts were very difficult to make out what Bible story they were trying to portray.  The filming is terrable, shaky camera work and most of the film is slightly out of focus.  There are no adults in the movie, only child actors, which makes the film more innocent in nature.  After all we all come to God as a child.  That is scriptural.  All of the children do an excelent job of acting. There is child nudity in the film briefly at the beginning and the end.  Although the nudity is tasteful and fits the part of Adam and Eve.  The ending is the best, where Satan finds out that he has not seperated God from man and he apears upset about it. Rightfully he should be.  I gave the rating as 3 stars mainly due to the camera work.  I know it was low budget but that could have been done better.",3,"Great message, great acting.",1284854400,"09 19, 2010",2010,944,"['bought', 'film', 'mainly', 'Biblical', 'message', 'was', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'went', 'Bible', 'most', 'part', 'acts', 'were', 'very', 'difficult', 'make', 'out', 'what', 'Bible', 'story', 'were', 'trying', 'portray', 'filming', 'terrable', 'shaky', 'camera', 'work', 'most', 'film', 'slightly', 'focus', 'are', 'adults', 'movie', 'only', 'child', 'actors', 'film', 'more', 'innocent', 'nature', 'come', 'God', 'child', 'scriptural', 'children', 'do', 'excelent', 'job', 'acting', 'child', 'nudity', 'film', 'briefly', 'beginning', 'end', 'nudity', 'tasteful', 'part', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'ending', 'best', 'where', 'Satan', 'out', 'not', 'seperated', 'God', 'man', 'upset', 'Rightfully', 'should', 'be', 'gave', 'rating', '3', 'stars', 'mainly', 'due', 'camera', 'work', 'know', 'was', 'low', 'budget', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better']",The Annunciation
