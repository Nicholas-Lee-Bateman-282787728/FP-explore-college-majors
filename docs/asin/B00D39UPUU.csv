His demon butler Claude to tend to his every whim and wish, along with Hannah the maid and the triplets servants, Alois orders Claude to take Ciel to make Ciel Alois's proerty.Pros: This series is rated TV-MA, the first season is TV-14. So TV-MA means (in the show) More blood and more darkness and more of a past behind Alois who has a past that would scar anyone.Cons: this is only 12 episodes so its only half as long as the first series and the OVA'S are alright to say the least.Over all: This is still  avery entertaining and will keep you on the edge of your seat!!",5,The sequal to a legend,1405296000,"07 14, 2014",2014,860,"['continue-ation', 'first', 'Black', 'Butler', 'show.Plot', 'characters', 'minor', 'spoilers', 'Following', 'events', 'first', 'season', 'ended', 'introducing', 'Alois', 'Trancy', 'Earl', 'Ciel', 'Alois', 'super', 'bratty', 'spoiled', 'child', 'who', 'everything', 'nothing', 'same', 'time', 'demon', 'butler', 'Claude', 'tend', 'whim', 'wish', 'Hannah', 'maid', 'triplets', 'servants', 'Alois', 'orders', 'Claude', 'take', 'Ciel', 'make', 'Ciel', 'Alois', 'proerty.Pros', 'series', 'rated', 'TV-MA', 'first', 'season', 'TV-14', 'TV-MA', 'means', 'show', 'More', 'blood', 'more', 'darkness', 'more', 'past', 'Alois', 'who', 'past', 'would', 'scar', 'anyone.Cons', 'only', '12', 'episodes', 'so', 'only', 'half', 'as', 'long', 'first', 'series', 'OVA', 'are', 'alright', 'say', 'least.Over', 'still', 'avery', 'entertaining', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat']",Black Butler: Season 2

1653393,A22OD81Z9HYFV1,B00D39UPUU,Kris,"[0, 0]","What happens when you follow up an excellent anime series with an excellent sequel? You get Black Butler 2, the highly anticipated sequel to the hit anime series. It may go without saying, but you should absolutely watch the first season before watching the second season.The second season of the popular series starts out with two new characters, and since they are on the cover of this collection, one would expect them to be the new main characters of the show. However, after watching about five minutes of the first episode, you can tell that Earl Alois Trancy (the boy on the cover) is not a nice person. His butler, Claude Faustus, looks like a clone of Sebastian from the first season; he even steals Sebastian's catchphrase.As anyone can probably guess, Ciel and Sebastian do return in this season, as well as all the other characters from the show, so do not feel put off if you actually thought that this would be a season of entirely new characters. The aforementioned characters, Alois and Caude, lead off the new cast. Alois is a very spoiled rich noble, much like Ciel, but he has a poor disposition in comparison. Claude, his butler, is a very devoted butler who was contracted to Alois, much like Sebastian. Claude does wear glasses most of the time, just in case you cannot tell the difference between the two of them the first time he shows up.This season does seem to be darker than the last, and seems to forgo the humor after the first few episodes. Normally, you would expect Ciel's servants to appear to deliver some humor, but they really do not show up all that much. The season is mostly about Ciel and his connection to Alois, as well as Sebastian and his rivalry with Claude. Included on this set are the 6 OVA episodes, which are usually very humorous in comparison to the regular episodes. The Ciel in Wonderland episodes are very cute, especially if you like Alice in Wonderland spoofs. The episode, The Making of Black Butler 2 is definitely the most hilarious episode of the entire series.This set comes from Funimation, just like the previous season, which is good. It definitely shows that they put much effort into this set, maybe even more than the last season. This set includes all 12 episodes of the season as well as the 6 OVA episodes. There are a few special features like English commentary, textless songs, and previews for both seasons. If you like supernatural Victorian-era anime with dueling butlers, then you should check this series out.",5,The classy butler returns,1383609600,"11 5, 2013",2013,2489,"['What', 'when', 'follow', 'up', 'excellent', 'anime', 'series', 'excellent', 'sequel', 'get', 'Black', 'Butler', '2', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'sequel', 'hit', 'anime', 'series', 'may', 'go', 'saying', 'should', 'absolutely', 'watch', 'first', 'season', 'watching', 'second', 'season.The', 'second', 'season', 'popular', 'series', 'out', 'two', 'new', 'characters', 'are', 'cover', 'collection', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'be', 'new', 'main', 'characters', 'show', 'However', 'watching', 'about', 'five', 'minutes', 'first', 'episode', 'can', 'tell', 'Earl', 'Alois', 'Trancy', 'boy', 'cover', 'not', 'nice', 'person', 'butler', 'Claude', 'Faustus', 'clone', 'Sebastian', 'first', 'season', 'even', 'Sebastian', 'catchphrase.As', 'anyone', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'Ciel', 'Sebastian', 'do', 'return', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'characters', 'show', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'put', 'off', 'actually', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'season', 'entirely', 'new', 'characters', 'aforementioned', 'characters', 'Alois', 'Caude', 'lead', 'off', 'new', 'cast', 'Alois', 'very', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'noble', 'much', 'Ciel', 'poor', 'disposition', 'comparison', 'Claude', 'butler', 'very', 'devoted', 'butler', 'who', 'was', 'contracted', 'Alois', 'much', 'Sebastian', 'Claude', 'wear', 'glasses', 'most', 'time', 'just', 'case', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'difference', 'two', 'first', 'time', 'up.This', 'season', 'seem', 'be', 'darker', 'last', 'forgo', 'humor', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'Normally', 'would', 'expect', 'Ciel', 'servants', 'appear', 'deliver', 'humor', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'show', 'up', 'much', 'season', 'mostly', 'Ciel', 'connection', 'Alois', 'as', 'well', 'Sebastian', 'rivalry', 'Claude', 'Included', 'set', 'are', '6', 'OVA', 'episodes', 'are', 'usually', 'very', 'humorous', 'comparison', 'regular', 'episodes', 'Ciel', 'Wonderland', 'episodes', 'are', 'very', 'cute', 'especially', 'like', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'spoofs', 'episode', 'Making', 'Black', 'Butler', '2', 'definitely', 'most', 'hilarious', 'episode', 'entire', 'series.This', 'set', 'Funimation', 'just', 'previous', 'season', 'good', 'definitely', 'put', 'much', 'effort', 'set', 'maybe', 'even', 'more', 'last', 'season', 'set', '12', 'episodes', 'season', 'as', 'well', '6', 'OVA', 'episodes', 'are', 'few', 'special', 'features', 'English', 'commentary', 'textless', 'songs', 'previews', 'seasons', 'like', 'supernatural', 'Victorian-era', 'anime', 'dueling', 'butlers', 'then', 'should', 'check', 'series', 'out']",Black Butler: Season 2
