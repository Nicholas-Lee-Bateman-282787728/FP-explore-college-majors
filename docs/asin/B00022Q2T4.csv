This movie kept you wondering what was going to happen next.  Sophia Loren looks everywhere for her husband. I felt like I was looking with her for her husband.  Great Movie only downside were the subtitles because of the language barrier.",5,"I love this story of romance, the war and lost love.",1401148800,"05 27, 2014",2014,369,"['love', 'story', 'romance', 'war', 'lost', 'love', 'Sophia', 'Loren', 'very', 'great', 'actress', 'movie', 'lived', 'up', 'movie', 'kept', 'wondering', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'Sophia', 'Loren', 'everywhere', 'husband', 'felt', 'was', 'looking', 'husband', 'Great', 'Movie', 'only', 'downside', 'were', 'subtitles', 'language', 'barrier']",N/A

It's a well made story of lives that intersect and then separate, to reunite briefly and find out that people have grown into different beings after some years. the story itself is a detail, the character development is the true center of the movie.",5,outstanding,1389225600,"01 9, 2014",2014,298,"['One', 'best', 'performance', 'two', 'actors', 'well', 'made', 'story', 'lives', 'intersect', 'then', 'separate', 'reunite', 'briefly', 'find', 'out', 'people', 'have', 'grown', 'different', 'beings', 'years', 'story', 'detail', 'character', 'development', 'true', 'center', 'movie']",N/A

822011,A3JA0ENH5WFQKN,B00022Q2T4,Leslie G. Milton,"[0, 0]","Well, the improbabilities are improbable.  How can we believe she could have found her way to the right spot in Russia?  But the emotional intensity is fully believable -- young lovers in the height of passion, the complexity of feelings in a man who awoke from the horror of war in the Russian winter to tender ministrations of the woman who saved his life, and shock of recognition and sense of betrayal in a woman who has found her love is alive after an impossibly difficult search.  Just the closeup of Sophia Loren's face as her character sees her long lost husband descend from the train to be greeted by his Russian wife is enough to distinguish the film as a great piece of story-telling.  Maybe not the best of the Loren-Mastroianni matchups, but then not all fine diamonds are the Kohinoor.",4,"With DeSica, Mastroianni, and Loren, how can you go wrong?",1401062400,"05 26, 2014",2014,801,"['Well', 'improbabilities', 'are', 'improbable', 'How', 'can', 'believe', 'could', 'have', 'found', 'way', 'right', 'spot', 'Russia', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'fully', 'believable', 'young', 'lovers', 'height', 'passion', 'complexity', 'feelings', 'man', 'who', 'awoke', 'horror', 'war', 'Russian', 'winter', 'tender', 'ministrations', 'woman', 'who', 'saved', 'life', 'shock', 'recognition', 'sense', 'betrayal', 'woman', 'who', 'found', 'love', 'alive', 'impossibly', 'difficult', 'search', 'Just', 'closeup', 'Sophia', 'Loren', 'face', 'character', 'long', 'lost', 'husband', 'descend', 'train', 'be', 'greeted', 'Russian', 'wife', 'enough', 'distinguish', 'film', 'great', 'piece', 'story-telling', 'Maybe', 'not', 'best', 'Loren-Mastroianni', 'matchups', 'then', 'not', 'fine', 'diamonds', 'are', 'Kohinoor']",N/A
