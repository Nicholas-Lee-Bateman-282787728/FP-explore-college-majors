135112,A3QP8RGAUPF2OS,0792833260,"A Customer ""Vicarious sycophants will abuse t...","[0, 2]","[Rainman]This was a profound movie about a completely bizarre outcome (a relatively erratic data point) in the phenomenon of what is loosely diagnosed as autism.  The savant Raymond is probably in the top five, best performances in film or stage, ever.  Dustin Hoffman is outstanding, a talent in class by himself.  Actor Tom Cruise is becoming more and more an interesting fixture on the American media scene; i.e. a public personality.The more elaborate, dictionary definition is `autism spectrum disorder', why such unique description?  Because it's such a varyingly spread, or spectrum-like ROY G BIV of impairment it is a medical cause still basically poorly understood.Somewhere along the way, this movie picked up enough popularity to become cultural literacy, and in turn distorted what the public really takes for understanding the disorder of autism.  Take the book:  ""The thing about the dog and ...etc...""  by Marc Hadden (upside down black poodle on pink jacket, can't miss it); that author actually tries to capture some of the myth momentum generated by the film Rainman and other spotlight stories in the media showcasing the so called `idiot savant'--not a very humane, and I think out of use label.  True freak of natural capacity somewhere in them.  Yet not all developed memory stems from people who are otherwise, more or less mentally retarded, requiring supervised care.  Patrick Stewart, the actor, can read and act all parts of the Dickens play `A Christmas Carol', on stage, in person, from memory.You don't have to be `dumb', to be smart...let's remember...in case anti-intellectualism tries too hard to popularize that misconception.  There is no reason to surrender your unenumerated rights of conscience to a second class citizen status just because you will do your own thinking about things.  We have no idea what grave danger a society is in when the wheeze box of the media propaganda starts to manufacture such conformity for the people's raw intelligence.  This is what George Orwell wrote about in his novel ""1984"".  Oh yeeeeee'ees!--has come home to roost.  Otherwise anybody who thinks they know something is automatically dismissed, why?  Because they're obviously speaking without a license to do so and must therefore be some babbling mental incompetent.  Don't let the Snot's Sector for Immoral Abuses pull that con on you.Most autistics are not so unusual.  They form part of the population of challenged and exception people who struggle with enormous disadvantages each and every day--and not pulling off feats of extraordinary computation or selective recall; by in large, incoherent and unable to interact in the mainstream.  Fortunately there is still enough humanity in this society to provide substantial care giver support and a happier life for them, housing and activities, nursing and so on.The mentally retarded, portrayed in this false light of super-human intellectual skills, is a double disservice deception:  it tries to disguise epidemic casualty in epidemiology as some heroic fantasy (in order to go on manufacturing those victims with obvious mass population fluoropoisoning), while it recycles the aftermath to chide the idea the public has any recourse to reasoning.That is unfortunately how ugly the situation is where populations are being parasitized by predators lurking amongst them.  The predator does not want exposure it is preying and profiting through human destruction and ramified corruptions its dirt imposes on the institutions of law enforcement and government, even mainstream religious organizations, the health organization and disaster response professionals (who weren't `born yesterday' either).  Therefore that predator has to invent a conspiracy that no one can ever expose it for what it is.  Nobody else, (by definition), from that point forward, can have the intellectual capacity to fathom the mastery of its world-beater agenda.  They are Aldous Huxley's indulgent `Alphas', the favorite children of a malevolent system of socialistic fascism in the living novel ""Brave New World""--there's more than one way to suffocate the perfectly manageable gradation of intelligence in the population.  But that industrial syndicate will inevitably be caught by its own avalanching evil exploits.  Too many epidemics, too many dead babies, too many rube-frauds so idiotic in pretense it makes people ashamed to see adult collaborators put on an act for it, like it's perfectly ok;  too much lingering advancement of knowledge leaking into public education.  `Who authorized they teach the autonomic nervous system in those worthless American public secondary schools, or any anatomy!?', the most grotesque opportunists are always in for their ultimate upending, especially when their operation requires closing down public education in order to insure the public doesn't think.  In the lah'lah land of Happy Valley Mormon Utah, that fantasy has obviously been too temptingly believable, that is why Utah is one of the escape patterns for that titanic political corruption's movement in America, a holed-up, out in nowhere hideaway, a sovereign haven where enormity might still be able to escape the light of day.Science, as it must be contorted to the whims of ultimate corruption, is centered on the authority to pontificate `intelligent design' to school kids, or for what the uneducated, at least unaware public will mistake for the only debate or branch of science.  The language rights of the biologists must be impounded and seized on the pretext `evolutionary theory' offends, moreover to just shut down critical thought in general and along with them the climatologists who dare speak the words:  `global warming'.  A disagreeable, irrational population is not permitted.  That is the only thing abject ignoramus `leadership' comprehends.  With that nuisance distraction whipped up to a frenzy, by the usual suspects in the past year or so, hopefully nobody will care or bother with what words like:  oncology, histology, cytology, nephrology, neurology, pathology, epidemiology, ... et al, could ever mean or be useful for.  Quite a neat little arrangement, the media is.  Ask 60 MINUTES what an autism epidemic is.  Tell them it is not a million 6 year old concert pianists.Another disappointment, the film's idea any mental ability (the unnatural kind) ought  be best exercised at the Las Vegas gambling table, in the dim witted, short sighted Hollywood estimation of intrinsic value.",5,Decoys for the US Autism Pandemic,1146441600,"05 1, 2006",2006,6479,"['[', 'Rainman', ']', 'was', 'profound', 'movie',

135116,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,0792833260,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 4]","This discussion needs to begin with the idea that whatever critique comes of this film; it is not in direct correlation to those that suffer from autism.  The words written herein are only used to discuss the film ""Rain Man"", not to have a lengthy discussion on my thoughts with this serious condition.  With that said, I recently had the opportunity to sit down and watch ""Rain Man"" commercial-free, and unedited by TV - viewing it the way audiences may have seen it in theaters - and I wondered - is ""Rain Man"" that wonderful of a film, or we just all taken-aback by the intense performance by Dustin Hoffman?  This is a tough question as I was somewhat bored with the story that Morrow and Base put together, yet each scene that Hoffman was in I was glued to the screen watching his idiosyncrasies, his apt ability to make this character out of merely studied influences.  Hoffman deserved the Oscar for this film, but again, looking back - was it deserving of everything else that it won?""Rain Man"" recycles this age old story that Hollywood is familiar with, a dying family member leaves a will to another, unknown, family member that eventually becomes the savior of the film.  The groundlings to this story are not anything new to direct-to-video markets, but with Hoffman and Cruise headlining, there is more of a mass appeal.  What pulls this film up is, as already stated, Hoffman - continuing to prove his worth - but yet slips downward yet again with Cruise.  He seems to be a bit of a loose cannon in this role.  For the first moment that we see him, he is this fast-talking, smooth sailing entrepreneur that seems to be going through this financial crisis.  Randomly he is able to leave, drive from California to Florida and finally making a pit stop in Ohio for his father's funeral.  Upon arriving he becomes bitter and more sinister as he learns that he is not inheriting his father's wealth, but instead has a brother that will have it all.  As we discover whom this is - our film changes from this family plight to this road movie - going all over our great nation to demonstrate brotherly love.  Yet - from the moment this voyage begins, we see less and less of the Cruise's initial character and we are welcomed into the third stage of Cruise, caring man who is just trying to survive.Where ""Rain Man"" gets itself into trouble is that Hoffman is so good, we are unable to fully develop Cruise's character.  We are glued to Hoffman on the screen, and thus Cruise can get away with anything (slipping in and out of character within scenes) because are eyes are focused on one man, and one man only.  Cruise does give a performance in this film, but it seems stale and disjointed.  His emotion never seems to come out, especially with the very dark ending - leaving us with no hope for the future?  The bleakest of endings, I was left wondering how much this would have worked if we were to focus on Cruise's character throughout, only giving us glimpses of Hoffman throughout the film.  I would have liked to see his inner turmoil, his struggle without the glossiness that was handed to us.  As a man with no money, he was easily able to maneuver anything that his brother wanted?  The suits for Vegas were not free.  Yet, we seem to let this slide off our backs when we talk about this film because we are all in awe of Hoffman, which we have every right to be.  Personally, Hoffman deserves all the kudos for his role, but watch Cruise carefully; I believe he gives one of the worst performances of his career.Then there is Barry Levinson.  There is so much that I like about him as a director and there are moments in this film that he pulls your heartstrings hard - and with the greatest of ease.  He never gave us a false impression of autism - there are these moments where we believe Hoffman will say something that doesn't fit, there are plenty of music-leading moments, but instead he pulls the rug and gives us honesty and truth.  I appreciated that and adored Levinson's choice of cinematography, but the ending needed work.  Once we were out of the car, we were rushed to a conclusion.  The less-tender moments at the end didn't congeal well, leaving us with false hope and darkness.  This isn't a happy film, and I just don't think Levinson had a way to wrap it up.  The train scene was disappointing and disastrous to say the least.Overall, I think I am going to answer my own question.  ""Rain Man"" doesn't seem to last the test of time.

It doesn't try that hard to do much other than to warm your heart and feed you a schmaltzy story about brothers at different ends of the spectrum coming together and learning to love.  From that angle, the film can be delightful.  When taking a step back and taking in the lack of true substance, the film becomes less agreeable.  The film offers very little depth and simply remains contented with giving us one of those formulaic stories that tries nothing new and thus becomes rather forgettable.  It is moving (that dance scene still makes me cry) but it is a surface affectation, something that reduces us to emotional tears because of the mere hint at a subject and not because we are invested in the film's soul.

135122,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,0792833260,andy8047,"[1, 4]","Raymond Babbitt(Dustin Hoffman) is what is called an ""autistic savant"". His brain does not function in the typical fashion. I must admit he is a superb mathemetician. He has difficulty communicating and learning. He is set in his own ways of acting,thinking,eating,sleeping,walking,talking,using the bathroom,you name it. Any sudden unprepared break from his daily routine and weekly rituals terrify Raymond. Raymond has a younger brother Charlie(Tom Cruise) who is a typical healthy human being. The Babbitt brothers' father passed away and when Charlie learns about the death,that's when he learned that he had an older brother. The Babbitts' mother died when Charlie was a toddler and Raymond was in his 20's. Charlie is bequeathed a vintage 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible. That's what brought his relationship with his father to an end. Charlie tells his girlfriend Susanna(Valeria Golino) that when he was in high school,he took a car for a victory spin against his dad's authority. He brought home a report card with almost all A's. The father reported the car stolen,spitefully to teach his son a lesson. Charlie felt he deserved it although the car was his dad's pride and joy. Charlie and a few friends of his were arrested and all but Charlie were shortly bailed out of jail. So Charlie ended up leaving home and he never saw his dad again. Charlie also got prize-winning rosebushes. Raymond,who doesn't understand the concept of money,was left $3 million. Charlie does all he can to gain custody of his brother and get his rightful share of the monetary bequest($1.5 million). According to Dr. Bruner who's in charge of Wallbrook,Raymond's institution,says Raymond gets the best care there. Charlie felt Raymond would live his life civilly outside Wallbrook. When Charlie was a child,he was trying to pronounce his brother's name and it came out ""rain man"". During Raymond's temporary departure from Wallbrook,Charlie takes him to Las Vegas. They play blackjack and win a lot of money. They even receive a penthouse suite,complimentarily as a result of their winnings. At a diner one morning,after eating a pancake breakfast,Raymond immediately knew that 246 of 250 toothpicks fell out of a box onto the floor. ""There's four left in the box."",the waitress says. Raymond even briefly drove the '49 Buick in one or two scenes. In one of the final scenes,a private hearing takes place regarding Raymond. Raymond can't decide whether to stay with Charlie or go back to Wallbrook. Director Barry Levinson plays Dr. Mardsen,who's in charge of Raymond's psychic evaluation program. Raymond kept saying,""Go back to Wallbrook with Charlie Babbitt"". So Dr. Bruner took Raymond back to Wallbrook. This film was theatrically released on December 16,1988. It won three Oscars. Levinson took home a Best Director Oscar,Hoffman took home a Best Actor Oscar,and best screenplay. Other films directed by Levinson are GOOD MORNING VIETNAM,starring Robin Williams which was another Academy Award winner and TIN MEN.

Tom Cruise is typecast as his selfish, arrogant, bossy younger brother Charlie. Charlie never even knew he had a brother until their father died and left the bulk of his estate to Raymond. Or rather, to a trust for the care of Raymond, administered by his doctor at the hospital where he has spent most of his life.When Charlie learns that the father he had rejected had left him only his classic convertible car and the roses the father had loved and Charlie had hated, he went looking for the trustee of the $3 million trust fund and its beneficiary. The doctor didn't want to tell him, but he found out anyway that it was his older brother Raymond -- whom he had apparently called Rain Man as a little kid, and remembered as an imaginary companion rather than a real brother.The reasons why Raymond had been sent away, and never mentioned, as well as the estrangement between Charlie and his father, come out slowly, and I won't spoil it for you. But the upshot is that Charlie lures Raymond into the convertible with Charlie's girlfriend Susanna (played by an adorable Valeria Golino) and effectively kidnaps him. He calls the trustee doctor and demands half the trust fund to bring him back. When the doctor refuses, and Raymond freaks out at the prospect of flying to California with Charlie, they set off to drive there in the classic convertible.What happens along the way is both funny and sad, but the upshot is the brothers get to know one another. Raymond gets to have some experiences he would never have had at the hospital, but eventually Charlie recognizes what's best for Raymond and allows the doctor to take him home to the hospital.Dustin Hoffman does a brilliant job of portraying Raymond, which is a boon to those who have autism in their families, and would rather people had a positive image to promote compassion. That is, compassion for the autistic individual and for the family members who must find ways to cope with their needs.An excellent film.",4,Sweet Brother-Bonding Story With a Twist or Two,1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,2065,"['Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'brilliant', 'high-functioning', 'autistic', 'Raymond', 'Rain', 'Man', 'Babbitt', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'typecast', 'selfish', 'arrogant', 'bossy', 'younger', 'brother', 'Charlie', 'Charlie', 'never', 'even', 'knew', 'had', 'brother', 'father', 'died', 'left', 'bulk', 'estate', 'Raymond', 'rather', 'trust', 'care', 'Raymond', 'administered', 'doctor', 'hospital', 'where', 'spent', 'most', 'life.When', 'Charlie', 'father', 'had', 'rejected', 'had', 'left', 'only', 'classic', 'convertible', 'car', 'roses', 'father', 'had', 'loved', 'Charlie', 'had', 'hated', 'went', 'looking', 'trustee', '3', 'million', 'trust', 'fund', 'beneficiary', 'doctor', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'tell', 'found', 'out', 'anyway', 'was', 'older', 'brother', 'Raymond', 'whom', 'had', 'apparently', 'called', 'Rain', 'Man', 'little', 'kid', 'remembered', 'imaginary', 'companion', 'rather', 'real', 'brother.The', 'reasons', 'why', 'Raymond', 'had', 'been', 'sent', 'away', 'never', 'mentioned', 'as', 'well', 'estrangement', 'Charlie', 'father', 'come', 'out', 'slowly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'upshot', 'Charlie', 'Raymond', 'convertible', 'Charlie', 'girlfriend', 'Susanna', 'played', 'adorable', 'Valeria', 'Golino', 'effectively', 'kidnaps', 'trustee', 'doctor', 'trust', 'fund', 'bring', 'back', 'When', 'doctor', 'Raymond', 'out', 'prospect', 'flying', 'California', 'Charlie', 'set', 'off', 'drive', 'there', 'classic', 'convertible.What', 'way', 'funny', 'sad', 'upshot', 'brothers', 'get', 'know', 'one', 'Raymond', 'have', 'experiences', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'had', 'hospital', 'eventually', 'Charlie', 'what', 'best', 'Raymond', 'doctor', 'take', 'home', 'hospital.Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'brilliant', 'job', 'portraying', 'Raymond', 'boon', 'who', 'have', 'autism', 'families', 'would', 'rather', 'people', 'had', 'positive', 'image', 'promote', 'compassion', 'compassion', 'autistic', 'individual', 'family', 'members', 'who', 'must', 'find', 'ways', 'cope', 'needs.An', 'excellent', 'film']",N/A

Dustin Hoffman nails his character of an autistic brother of the always interesting Cruise. Hoffman got the Oscar for this performance. Cruise is in need of money, and it is all he cares about, not family, not relationships. He finds his brother by chance and tries to get part of the money he received after their father died. The movie is touching, but also funny. There is one terrific scene when Cruise stops at a shrink office to get some help, and when the nurse asks him what is the reason he is there, he says ""My brother is autistic"", and she asks: ""Artistic? What is that ... ?"" This scene is very funny, really funny. Also, when Hoffman wants 8 pieces of fish (instead of 4), Cruise finds a very easy and funny way to work that out. You have to see that for yourself. Hoffman, besides being an ""excellent driver"", can ""gamble"" really good. So they stop by Las Vegas to get some easy money and learn how to fall in love.It's a really good movie, very entertaining, and very interesting.

He finds out he has an older autistic brother named Raymond who has all the money put in trust for his care. Charlie takes Raymond on a drive back to L.A. to await a hearing on custody of Raymond, and the film is, in effect, their cross country journey.I have seen this film many times before, as have others, and I would suggest a new way to view this: just watch Tom Cruise's underappreciated performance. He is very confident and sure of himself, and holds his own against Hoffman. His character does change slightly throughout the film, but Cruise never allows Charlie to do a 180 into sainthood. Even at the climactic hearing, he speaks shortly to Raymond, and their final scene after the hearing, where Raymond leans his head on Charlie's, is wonderful.Hoffman deserved the Oscar for best actor. Sure, everyone did their own Raymond impressions (until Tom Hanks' Forrest Gump came along; why do some people think mental retardation is funny?), but Hoffman has not been this good very often since (""Hero"", anyone?).The screenplay is wonderful, despite a troubled history and multiple endings. The one scene I had a problem with is when Charlie figures out who Raymond was to him as a child, and Levinson basically has Cruise talk to himself as a way to let those in the audience know. I cannot stand that. We can figure it out without Cruise mumbling ""they sent you away because they thought you hurt me."" This is just quibbling, however, considering other positives here. Levinson uses overlapping dialogue to a wonderful extent, with Cruise always talking and trying to find a way out of a jam. His scene where he keeps repeating his inheritance, the rose bushes, to his father's lawyer, while the lawyer tries to talk, is funny and a foreshadowing to Hoffman's Raymond. Maybe Raymond does not say some of the things he says because he is autistic, but because he is a Babbit. When Robert Altman uses overlapping dialogue, it seems forced, boring, and something you must endure until Sally Kellerman or some other leading lady agrees to take her clothes off. Here, it is very natural. Valeria Golina is also good as Charlie's exasperated Italian girlfriend.Hans Zimmer provides an incredible score that is not used often enough. The pick of songs, from Bananarama's remake of ""Nathan Jones,"" to ""At Last"" seemed to be collected to make the movie work, not because someone wanted a hit soundtrack a la ""Footloose"" or ""Beverly Hills Cop.""""Rain Man"" is a great film, and one that deserves a fresh look today.This is rated (R) for some physical violence, strong profanity, brief female nudity, some sexual content, and some sexual references.

Hustwick,"[0, 0]","One of the major films of the late 80s, Rain Man was a huge hit and catapulted Tom Cruise even further into the stratosphere as Hollywood's leading star. And I think he deserved it -- he gave a great performance as the most complex character he's ever shown onscreen, the sleazy Los Angelino Charlie Babbitt. Eyes Wide Shut, Collateral, and all of the rest don't even come close. When Tom gets his inevitable AFI retrospective, this will be at the top of the list. And Dustin Hoffman seems to take on the character of Raymond completely, although it's almost seems like more of an enormous acting exercise more than a character.Is the film sentimental? Of course it is -- but then it's about some very painful subjects and I think it handles them exceedingly well.  I suppose it helps that Raymond is something of a genius, but I don't think that undermines the truth in so many of the scenes, or the beautifully crafted script  where we find out little by little just what a lost person Charlie is (Tom Cruise) and how he comes to realize that he's an arrogant, self-centered jerk. I think it's a believable premise that's executed brilliantly. Rain Man deserved its accolades and is an exemplary film on many levels. It's a much better film than Steven Spielberg or many other Hollywood A-listers has ever made.

As Raymond Babbitt, Dustin Hoffman truly deserved that Oscar for he evokes so much emotion from the viewer it's almost impossible to keep from tearing up.  Tom Cruise on the other hand is easily overshadowed by the depth in Hoffman's performance.  I'm not a fan of Cruise and feel he's overly praised by many.  His performance here was better than the majority of his others and he in no way detracts from the power of the film, but he could have been substituted and I'd have no issues with that.Charlie Babbitt (Cruise) is a pompous, self centered, materialistic jerk who's in dire need of some cash.  When he hears that his estranged father has recently died (a man he hasn't personally spoken with since he was sixteen) he travels with his girlfriend (Valeria Golino) to the funeral.  Upon discussing his fathers will he discovers that he wasn't left anything but a classic car and some roses.  His fathers millions on the other hand were left to Raymond (Hoffman), Charlie's autistic brother whom he's never known off.  In a purely selfish attempt at receiving his share of his fathers fortune Charlie, in a way, kidnaps his brother to force the trusties hand to pay up.  Because of Raymond's fear of flying the two brother's end up on a cross country trip towards LA that causes Charlie to slowly change; realizing that this is more than money, this is about having a real relationship with a brother he never knew.There are two scenes in particular that really got me, both involving a dance.  The first is when Raymond wants to learn to dance.  Charlie then teaches him, and the reason this scene really touched me was because it was the first act of pure selflessness on Charlie's part, the first scene where Charlie was doing something for Raymond, not because he wanted something from him but because he wanted to do something nice for him.  The next involves Raymond and Susanna (Golino) in an elevator.  After Raymond is `stood-up' for his first date Susanna stops the elevator and has Raymond show her how he would have danced with his date, and then she kisses him.  It's the single sweetest scene in the film for here is a person with no ties to Raymond whatsoever doing something for him; I mean I can't even begin to explain how touching that one scene is for me.So, in closing, `Rain Man' is a movie that is meant to inspire, to move and compel others to open there hearts, and to that effect it truly works.  To watch Charlie transform over time from loathing his brother to accepting and loving him (although my pet-peeve with this film is that at the end when his brother is on the bus Charlie doesn't TELL him that he loves him) and that transformation is just so emotionally moving.  Thanks in a large way to Dustin Hoffman's brilliant Oscar winning performance, and even to Tom Cruise's development of character (I will admit he was convincing as a jerk who leant a lesson, as much as I despise him) `Rain Man' pays off in the end as a wonderful cinematic experience that EVERYONE should and can enjoy!",5,Open your minds and hearts for this one of a kind experience!,1166659200,"12 21, 2006",2006,3137,"['movie', 'will', 'truly', 'speak', 'many', 'ways', 'Rain', 'Man', 'hits', 'right', 'chords', 'over', 'again', 'Raymond', 'Babbitt', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'truly', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'so', 'much', 'emotion', 'viewer', 'almost', 'impossible', 'keep', 'tearing', 'up', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'other', 'hand', 'easily', 'overshadowed', 'depth', 'Hoffman', 'performance', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Cruise', 'feel', 'overly', 'praised', 'many', 'performance', 'here', 'was', 'better', 'majority', 'others', 'way', 'power', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'substituted', ""'d"", 'have', 'issues', 'that.Charlie', 'Babbitt', 'Cruise', 'pompous', 'centered', 'materialistic', 'jerk', 'who', 'dire', 'need', 'cash', 'When', 'estranged', 'father', 'recently', 'died', 'man', ""n't"", 'personally', 'spoken', 'was', 'sixteen', 'girlfriend', 'Valeria', 'Golino', 'funeral', 'discussing', 'fathers', 'will', 'was', ""n't"", 'left', 'anything', 'classic', 'car', 'roses', 'fathers', 'millions', 'other', 'hand', 'were', 'left', 'Raymond', 'Hoffman', 'Charlie', 'autistic', 'brother', 'whom', 'never', 'known', 'off', 'purely', 'selfish', 'attempt', 'receiving', 'share', 'fathers', 'fortune', 'Charlie', 'way', 'kidnaps', 'brother', 'force', 'trusties', 'hand', 'pay', 'up', 'Raymond', 'fear', 'flying', 'two', 'brother', 'end', 'up', 'cross', 'country', 'trip', 'towards', 'LA', 'Charlie', 'slowly', 'change', 'realizing', 'more', 'money', 'having', 'real', 'relationship', 'brother', 'never', 'are', 'two', 'scenes', 'particular', 'really', 'got', 'involving', 'dance', 'first', 'when', 'Raymond', 'learn', 'dance', 'Charlie', 'then', 'reason', 'scene', 'really', 'touched', 'was', 'was', 'first', 'act', 'pure', 'selflessness', 'Charlie', 'part', 'first', 'scene', 'where', 'Charlie', 'was', 'doing', 'something', 'Raymond', 'not', 'wanted', 'something', 'wanted', 'do', 'something', 'nice', 'next', 'Raymond', 'Susanna', 'Golino', 'elevator', 'Raymond', 'stood-up', 'first', 'date', 'Susanna', 'elevator', 'Raymond', 'show', 'how', 'would', 'have', 'danced', 'date', 'then', 'single', 'sweetest', 'scene', 'film', 'here', 'person', 'ties', 'Raymond', 'whatsoever', 'doing', 'something', 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'explain', 'how', 'touching', 'one', 'scene', 'me.So', 'closing', 'Rain', 'Man', 'movie', 'meant', 'inspire', 'move', 'compel', 'others', 'open', 'hearts', 'effect', 'truly', 'watch', 'Charlie', 'transform', 'time', 'loathing', 'brother', 'accepting', 'loving', 'pet-peeve', 'film', 'end', 'when', 'brother', 'bus', 'Charlie', ""n't"", 'TELL', 'transformation', 'just', 'so', 'emotionally', 'moving', 'Thanks', 'large', 'way', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'brilliant', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'performance', 'even', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'development', 'character', 'will', 'admit', 'was', 'convincing', 'jerk', 'who', 'leant', 'lesson', 'as', 'much', 'despise', 'Rain', 'Man', 'pays', 'end', 'wonderful', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'EVERYONE', 'should', 'can', 'enjoy']",N/A

135150,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,0792833260,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[10, 12]","Barry Levinson's name is well-known these days mostly as a producer but he has directed a good number of films that people are familiar with.  Films such as ""Sphere"", ""Wag the Dog"", ""Sleepers"", ""Bugsy"", ""Toys"", ""Avalon"", ""Good Morning Vietnam"", ""Diner"" to name a few.  But for one film, Levinson earned his Oscar and that was in 1988 for ""Rain Man"".  A story by Barry Morrow and a screenplay co-written by Morrow and Ronald Bass (""Snow Falling on Cedars"", ""Step Mom"", ""My Best Friend's Wedding"", ""Entrapment"", ""What Dreams May Come""), the film would also bring together America's top male actors Dustin Hoffman (""Tootsie"", ""Kramer vs. Kramer"", ""Ishtar"") and Tom Cruise (""Top Gun"", ""Cocktail"", ""Risky Business"", ""The Color of Money"").The film which was budgeted at $25 million, earned over $354 million (the film was the highest grossing film of 1988)  and would win four Academy awards including ""Best Director"", ""Best Picture"", ""Best Writing, Original Screenplay"" and a ""Best Actor in a Leading Role"" for Dustin Hoffman.VIDEO:""Rain Man"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1 widescreen). First, its important for me to remind everyone that this is a 1988 film and I've always had the opinion that many films from the '80s tend to have this aged look and sometimes appearances look soft. While for ""Rain Man"", the film does show its age in terms of film stock used, this is the best looking version of the film to date.There is a good amount of grain in this film but there is much more detail and edge enhancement can be seen at times.  If anything, the clarity and detail is much more evident in the Blu-ray release and there appears to be some noise reduction utilized as there are some moments of softness.  I did see banding in probably two moments of the film where there was high-reds and pinks.  It's a few-seconds scene but other than that, there are times where the picture quality looked very good and you can see the skin pigments on the skin.Otherwise, if you love the film, ""Rain Man"" on Blu-ray looks better than its DVD counterparts.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Rain Man"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish Mono and French Dolby Surround. While ""Rain Man"" has always been a dialogue-driven film, it also sports a solid musical soundtrack by Hans Zimmer.  If anything, you do hear some ambiance at times but for the most part, this is a center and front-channel driven lossless soundtrack with mostly instruments utilizing the surround channel at times.  You do get a scene where you watch Charlie and Raymond driving through a bridge and you can hear the wheels going over the bridge and sound coming through the surround channels but this is pretty much a dialogue-driven film.Subtitles are presented in English SDH, Spanish and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Rain Man"" comes with the following special features in Standard Definition:* Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by director Barry Levinson* Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by writer Barry Morrow* Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by writer Ronald Bass* The Journey of Rain Man - (22:07)  A featurette on the making of ""Rain Man"" and features interviews with director Barry Levinson and writers Barry Morrow and Ronald Bass.* Lifting the Fog: A Look at the Mysteries of Autism - (20:13) A featurette about autism and those who are similar to Raymond Babbitt.* Deleted Scene - (2:13) A deleted scene featuring Raymond at a convenience store (getting into trouble).* Original Theatrical Trailer - (2:13) Featuring the original theatrical trailer of ""Rain Man"" in standard definition.JUDGMENT CALL:Back in 1988, I was a junior in high school when I watched this film come out.  Of course, the film was popular because of Tom Cruise who was the top young actor in Hollywood with the popularity of ""Top Gun"", ""The Color of Money"" and ""Cocktail"", but what stood out for me the most was the performance by Dustin Hoffman, the writing of the film and the character relationship between Charlie and Raymond and it was the first time I heard about autism.Autism, of course, has been focused a lot more in today's society, may it be on the news or learning about it through television shows, but back then, I've never heard of it and I felt that ""Rain Man"" did increase public awareness for autism.If one was to dissect this film, I suppose one can say that it was longer than it should have been and could have been tightened a bit more and keeping the duration much lower.  I am aware that film critic Pauline Kael called it ""wet kitsch"" (which is a word that she tends to use for films that she really dislikes) but after watching this film once again since its release for VHS back in the '90s, my feelings back in the late '80s, to the '90s and now 2011 really hasn't changed all that much.What I enjoyed about the film is the fact that you get to see Charlie's arrogance directed towards his brother and to see this character change as he becomes more acquainted with his brother.  While some may feel the character of Charlie to be repulsive or overly cocky, the performance by Dustin Hoffman is magnificent.  The timing of the words and the motions that went into Raymond's character was well-done by Hoffman and I enjoyed how the conflict begins at the beginning and slowly works itself towards the end.  Of course, the ending may seem a bit too anti-climactic but for what it's worth, I did not want to see a mushy ending.  The ending fits right with Charlie Babbage and everything worked out.If I had any problems with the film, I still find the scene with Susanna and Raymond in an elevator to be a bit off and as mentioned earlier, there are some scenes that could have been trimmed off to keep the pacing much smoother and the duration not so long.As for the Blu-ray release, I was hoping for some sort of revisiting special feature and possibly an interview with Tom Cruise or Dustin Hoffman, heck even Barry Levinson.  But you do get all the special features from the ""Rain Man"" 2004 Special Edition DVD and upgraded picture quality and a lossless soundtrack.Overall, ""Rain Man"" is still an enjoyable film over 20-years later.  While the Blu-ray release may not include anything new compared to its 2004 DVD counterpart, it does look and sound a lot better.  So, if you enjoyed ""Rain Man"" a lot, then I definitely recommend upgrading to Blu-ray.",4,"Blu-ray: Entertaining back in 1988, holds up well in 2011.

I've seen this movie several times (and hope to see it several times more) and walk away with a new appreciation for what Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman were able to accomplish with each viewing.This is a journey of discovery, as LA car dealer/hustler Charlie (Cruise) learns, upon the death of his estranged father, that he has a much older, autistic brother, Ray (Hoffman).  Angry that he has been shut out of his father's will, while Ray is the estate's benefactor, Charlie takes Ray out of his institution and the two brothers embark on a cross-country odyssey (including a trek through my stomping grounds in Oklahoma).  Ray is a fragile man of routine, and plucking him from his institution and traveling thousands of miles is a severe disruption; while Charlie, at first impatient and angry at Ray's outbursts, tries repeatedly to ""get through"" to his brother--to make a connection.  Again, this is a journey of discovery, and it is Charlie who discovers some very important things. . .about himself.Hoffman is totally convincing and believable as an introverted autistic savant; what's interesting is that I learned during a special showing of this film that Hoffman, while the movie was being shot, thought his performance so poor and shoddy he asked to be taken off the cast and be replaced by Richard Dreyfuss.  This demonstrates he was so invested in the character of Ray he wasn't giving the character the performance he thought it deserved.  Fortunately, director Barry Levinson (who appears, briefly, at the end of the film) declined Hoffman's request; and the rest, as they say, is cinematic history.  Hoffman and Cruise gave masterpiece performances, and RAIN MAN deserved all the accolades and awards it received.  If you haven't seen this movie, please, please do so.--D.

It is one of the best movies of the 1980s', and it has without doubt, one of the best performances ever seen on film.  Dustin Hoffman was amazing as Raymond Babbitt, an autistic man, whose younger brother, Charlie, played quite well by Tom Cruise, abducts him from the institution he is in in order to get his share of inheritance money.  The character of Charlie is very selfish and greedy, but as the film goes on he changes for the better.  He takes Raymond clear across the country by car because Raymond won't fly. Watching this film again made me realize that it is really one of the greatest films I've seen.  It's a bittersweet story of brotherly love, dramatic at times, but has a great deal of comedy blended in.  This is a film to be cherished for generations. I highly recommend Rain Man.  The performances by both Dustin Hoffman, who won the Oscar for best actor(very well deserved!), and Tom Cruise are outstanding.

135171,A1CIW2OEVAJRM2,0792833260,Godly Gadfly,"[0, 0]","An outstanding movie from the eighties that took four Academy Awards (Best Picture, Director, Screenplay, and Actor), ""Rainman"" is about the arrogant, selfish and materialistic hotshot car-dealer Charles Babbit (Tom Cruise) and his autistic brother Raymond (Dustin Hoffman).  Charlie is a struggling businessman on the verge of bankruptcy who doesn't even know he has a brother until his dad dies.  When he only inherits the rose bushes and a used car, he discovers that the rest of his father's wealth ($3 million) is put in a trust fund for his institutionalized brother.  Charlie takes up contact with Raymond, and because his real motive is to obtain his dad's millions, he kidnaps Ray and holds him for ransom.  The lack of sympathy we feel for Charlie's greed is matched by the sympathy we feel for his misunderstood brother Ray.  Charlie doesn't care about Ray: ""It's none of your business, stop acting like an idiot and reading that stupid phone book.""  Charlie's Italian girlfriend Susanna is the conscience that says otherwise: ""It's not right what you're doing to Raymond.""The turning point comes when Charlie's exasperated girlfriend walks out on him after living with him for a year, and only then does he finally begin to show sympathy for his brother.  Charlie comes to realize that Ray's brilliant memory and extraordinary ability with numbers has great potential in a casino.  But more importantly, he comes to realize that Ray is a brother whom he loves.  Their journey on the run is as much a journey of discovery for Charlie as it is for Ray. Charlie undergoes a dramatic transformation in character: ""I felt like giving you a hug.""  And: ""It's not about the money anymore.  Why didn't anyone ever tell me I had a brother?""  It is this heart-warming theme that becomes the movie's focal point.  Remarkably, Hollywood has produced a movie that shows the emptiness of materialism, and that emphasizes the wealth that lies in the fellowship of family relationships.But ""Rainman"" is also a sensitive look at people with mental disabilities, showing their strengths and weaknesses, and showing how they are as loveable as the rest of us.  This is heightened by some brilliant acting from Dustin Hoffman in particular, who produced an outstanding and convincing performance as autistic Raymond.  Hoffman's Academy Award winning performance is enhanced by a brilliant soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, and stellar directing which makes you see life from Raymond's autistic point of view (for instance his bewilderment as they drive across a bridge).There are also several delightful moments of warm humor - who can forget the memorable lines: ""I'm an excellent driver""; ""K-Mart sux""; ""Qantas never crashed""; and the classic ""I'm definitely not wearing underwear"".  There is a sex scene, but it is presented from Raymond's point of view and involves more suggestion than sight.  Even so, the frequent use of profanities as well as the strongly implied sexual content was enough to give this movie the R rating it deserves.  But if you can overlook the excessive amount of offensive content, this is a memorable movie that has the potential to change you as it changed Charlie - for the better.

I kept noticing flaws in his acting and to a large extent his dialogue which he obviously has no control over he just goes by the script. The thing about Cruise is that he is not believable, the director wanted us to feel angry and hold nothing but contempt for him but the only thing he achieved was unbeliavability.  Towards the end I forgave his flaws in the beginning of the film and accepted him as the character that he was portraying.Hoffman is at his best! Now he is absolutely believable, I didnt think for one second that he was puting on an act and thats the way it should be. Thats the way it should have been for Cruise since the beginnning but it wasnt. Hoffman held the weight of the movie on his shoulders and what weight it was! The plot is simple enough and I think that with the wrong casting for Rayman this movie would have been a flop.Funny enough as it might seem it is Cruise that holds the film together. While Hoffman holds it on his shoulders Cruise keeps it from toppling over. His character development is impressive and surprising. Towards the end we sympathise with Cruise as much as we do with Hoffman which I didnt think it was possible.Such a great movie to watch, with one exeption, with the whole family. The exeption being a sex scene where we dont see anything but the sound of a couple making love which is explicit enough to give the movie an R rating which is rediculous.

This unknown brother has been in an asylum for years and is a highly functioning autistic savant.RAIN MAN won several Academy Awards for this touching portrayal of two brothers coming to terms with each other. Dustin Hoffman was Best Actor for his role as Raymond. Tom Cruise is the materialistic young brother devasted and angered not only by the news of an older brother but the fact their recently departed father has left his estate to Raymond.Charlie is bitter and a player in a big man's world. He needs money and Raymond's inheritance is his future. He takes Raymond on a cross country trip but he is out for a big lesson in life and brotherly love. Raymond is very childlike and dependent on his routine. Lights out at 11 pm sharp, eating food with toothpicks and knowing exactly when PEOPLE'S COURT and WHEEL OF FORTUNE are on TV. Charlie has no patience or understanding for Raymond's simple needs and reliance on repetition. When Charlie learns Raymond's amazing mathematical skills and memory, it is time to stop off in Las Vegas.I've heard from firsthand sources that Dustin Hoffman researched his role with dedication and spent time with austic savants to learn their mannerisms and reactions. Hoffman shows his amazing talents and clearly deserved his Best Actor award. We have a young Tom Cruise just a few years into his acting career taking on a very serious role. Although he is ""normal"", Cruise's Charlie is far more immature in many ways than his autistic brother. There is a true beauty in this film as we see Charlie grow and mature in front of our eyes.

They were shown has human and having qualities and potentialities by far not exploited by their being closed up in some institutions. This particular Raymond was committed because he must have burned his baby brother in his bath. His family got rid of him, his father got him pent up. But the two brothers finally meet, thanks to an antique car. Though at this level the film is no longer a revelation, it shows how prolonged human contact opens up the mind of the autistic man and little by little brings him to some discovery of love, not only care, of fun, not only entertainment, of autonomy too, not only personal activities under heavy surveillance. Though he will have to go back to the institution, his brother will keep the possibility to meet him and take him under his responsibility regularly. This is still somewhat behind our present time, but it was a tremendous revolution in our way of thinking nearly twenty years ago. The motivations of the brother seem to be ambiguous : money at first (the inheritance from the dead father that was escaping him), then money again due to Raymond's ability at counting cards in a casino and being a real hit at the card table, and finally more human brotherly love, but only finally, and after he has made so much money in Las Vegas that he does not need a deal about the inheritance any more. Two great actors Tom Cruise as the brother and Dustin Hoffman as the autistic son. The choice was very much criticized at the time, and today it is unbearable. A real autistic actor should have been used, even if Hoffman does a marvelous job at the part, but he is not a real one, and his facial expression will never be that of a real autistic person. To be watched for the historical value of the film both on the subject of integrating autistic people in real society, and on the possibility that is appearing more and more to integrate  handicapped  actors in films. They can really be actors if they are properly directed. Ask the company L'Oiseau Mouche in Roubaix, France, funded by the European Community, for one instance.

A true labor of love for those involved, particularly its producers, director Barry Levinson, and star Dustin Hoffman, it remains an undated and compelling work, since its release sixteen years ago.  By now most know that Hoffman was heavily praised for his dead-on portrayal of an autistic savant, winning an Oscar in the process.  However, it is really Tom Cruise who is the heart and soul of the movie, portraying its true protagonist.  His is a very underrated performance, one that reminds how accomplished an actor he can be when given the right dramatic role.  Equally good is Levinson's direction, smartly exposing the humor on what could normally be viewed as overly sentimental material.  Included is one brief and all to basic featurette with cast and crew interviews of the time.  The one deleted scene featured is redundant of what's already in the movie.  The DVD makes up for all of this however with the inclusion of three audio commentaries to choose from.  In the end, the greatest strength of this package is the movie itself.  Whether it was indeed the best film of 1988 is a point of debate.

Hoffman's performance is consistent with the inconsistencies of autism, a disease still unfamiliar to most. The plot is simple. Cruise is all but ignored in his father's will, with 3 million dollars set aside in an anonymous trust.He soon learns that the benefactor is an unknown autistic brother living in a facility in Cincinnati.

135196,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,0792833260,Kenji Fujishima,"[9, 13]","Like one of the reviewers currently in the ""Spotlight Reviews"" section, I never really take the Academy Awards seriously as an indication of quality. It seems like for every worthy, challenging Academy Award-winning movie like AMERICAN BEAUTY there's something like RAIN MAN (which won four major Academy Awards in 1989): a safe, conservative, old-fashioned piece of Hollywood uplift that literally cries out to be showered with Oscars by the old-fashioned people at the AMPAS.Well, perhaps I'm being too cynical here. RAIN MAN is not a bad movie, by any means. It's an entertaining and occasionally illuminating drama about how an initially selfish jerk (Tom Cruise) becomes a better person after he spends a lot of time on the road with his autistic-savant brother (Dustin Hoffman). Such a movie risks being awkwardly mawkish, but director Barry Levinson avoids such pitfalls most of the time, although the script's lapses into cliched sentimentality unfortunately do stick out like Raymond's autism-induced obsessiveness. And the two performances by Hoffman and Cruise, really, are very good. This was one of Cruise's first serious dramatic roles, and he is never unconvincing in conveying Charlie's changing demeanor toward Raymond. As for Hoffman, who won an Oscar here, he obviously gives the more flashy performance, but he uncannily succeeds in drawing our sympathy for this wholly self-absorbed character. We like Raymond Babbitt, even if we aren't totally sure why. Overall, RAIN MAN is an enjoyable and sometimes genuinely touching movie about a man's change of heart.But, seriously, how many Hollywood ""prestige"" movies have charted a similar thematic trajectory? It's very unfortunate that Levinson and screenwriters Barry Morrow and Ronald Bass were merely aiming for that tired old ""triumph of the human spirit"" angle in a movie with an autistic at its center. Raymond Babbitt is a subject that could have made a truly remarkable, shattering cinematic exploration about how autism affects its victim and/or people around him, and what do these filmmakers do instead? Throw the autistic and his jerk brother together in a typical road-trip buddy movie plot (with faint echoes of MIDNIGHT RUN in some scenes), and focus much more on Charlie's change of heart rather than Raymond's fascinating psychological condition. The character here feels less like a real flesh-and-blood individual, more like a device to freshen up a plot and a central theme we've seen many, many times before. The filmmakers blew an opportunity to truly make us understand autism and how it affects people. Instead, we never truly feel for the poor guy at all (despite Hoffman's intermittently successful attempts at bringing us emotionally closer to his character), and that is a real shame.Look, I am perfectly capable of being truly moved by this kind of uplifting drama. (FORREST GUMP may have been a similar kind of conservative ""triumph of the human spirit"" drama, but at least that movie was without pretensions of being something more shattering than that...and it was truly touching to boot.) I'm sure a lot of people will watch this movie and love it on its own rather un-ambitious terms, feel that it is a ""nice"" movie, and even be inspired by it. For me, though, I was expecting something a lot more eloquent and haunting than this bland TV-movie-of-the-week treatment of a serious mental illness. This is hardly the definitive cinematic treatment of autism that health classes all over America tout it to be; you'd probably get more illumination from a PBS documentary on the subject than from here. So, for all its mildly moving moments and good performances, RAIN MAN comes as a disappointment, and certainly not the great movie its Best Picture Oscar suggests it is. It sure could have been a lot more than just another Best Picture Oscar winner.",3,Not nearly as great as its Best Picture Oscar suggests,1092787200,"08 18, 2004",2004,3849,"['one', 'reviewers', 'currently', 'Spotlight', 'Reviews', 'section', 'never', 'really', 'take', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'seriously', 'indication', 'quality', 'worthy', 'challenging', 'Academy', 'Award-winning', 'movie', 'AMERICAN', 'BEAUTY', 'something', 'like', 'RAIN', 'MAN', 'won', 'four', 'major', 'Academy', 'Awards', '1989', 'safe', 'conservative', 'old-fashioned', 'piece', 'Hollywood', 'uplift', 'literally', 'out', 'be', 'showered', 'Oscars', 'old-fashioned', 'people', 'AMPAS.Well', 'perhaps', ""'m"", 'being', 'too', 'cynical', 'here', 'RAIN', 'MAN', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'means', 'entertaining', 'occasionally', 'illuminating', 'drama', 'how', 'initially', 'selfish', 'jerk', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'better', 'person', 'lot', 'time', 'road', 'autistic-savant', 'brother', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'movie', 'risks', 'being', 'awkwardly', 'mawkish', 'director', 'Barry', 'Levinson', 'avoids', 'such', 'pitfalls', 'most', 'time', 'script', 'lapses', 'cliched', 'sentimentality', 'unfortunately', 'do', 'stick', 'out', 'Raymond', 'autism-induced', 'obsessiveness', 'two', 'performances', 'Hoffman', 'Cruise', 'really', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'was', 'one', 'Cruise', 'first', 'serious', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'never', 'unconvincing', 'conveying', 'Charlie', 'changing', 'demeanor', 'Raymond', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'here', 'obviously', 'more', 'flashy', 'performance', 'uncannily', 'drawing', 'sympathy', 'wholly', 'self-absorbed', 'character', 'like', 'Raymond', 'Babbitt', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'totally', 'sure', 'why', 'Overall', 'RAIN', 'MAN', 'enjoyable', 'sometimes', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'movie', 'man', 'change', 'heart.But', 'seriously', 'how', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'prestige', 'movies', 'have', 'charted', 'similar', 'thematic', 'trajectory', 'very', 'unfortunate', 'Levinson', 'screenwriters', 'Barry', 'Morrow', 'Ronald', 'Bass', 'were', 'merely', 'aiming', 'tired', 'old', 'triumph', 'human', 'spirit', 'angle', 'movie', 'autistic', 'center', 'Raymond', 'Babbitt', 'subject', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'shattering', 'cinematic', 'exploration', 'how', 'autism', 'victim', 'and/or', 'people', 'what', 'do', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'instead', 'Throw', 'autistic', 'jerk', 'brother', 'together', 'typical', 'road-trip', 'buddy', 'movie', 'plot', 'faint', 'echoes', 'MIDNIGHT', 'RUN', 'scenes', 'focus', 'much', 'more', 'Charlie', 'change', 'heart', 'rather', 'Raymond', 'fascinating', 'psychological', 'condition', 'character', 'here', 'less', 'real', 'flesh-and-blood', 'individual', 'more', 'device', 'freshen', 'up', 'plot', 'central', 'theme', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'many', 'times', 'before', 'filmmakers', 'blew', 'opportunity', 'truly', 'make', 'understand', 'autism', 'how', 'people', 'Instead', 'never', 'truly', 'feel', 'poor', 'guy', 'Hoffman', 'intermittently', 'successful', 'attempts', 'bringing', 'emotionally', 'closer', 'character', 'real', 'shame.Look', 'am', 'perfectly', 'capable', 'being', 'truly', 'moved', 'kind', 'uplifting', 'drama', 'FORREST', 'GUMP', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'similar', 'kind', 'conservative', 'triumph', 'human', 'spirit', 'drama', 'least', 'movie', 'was', 'pretensions', 'being', 'something', 'more', 'shattering', 'was', 'truly', 'touching', 'boot', ""'m"", 'sure', 'lot', 'people', 'will', 'watch', 'movie', 'love', 'own', 'rather', 'un-ambitious', 'terms', 'feel', 'nice', 'movie', 'even', 'be', 'inspired', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'lot', 'more', 'eloquent', 'haunting', 'bland', 'TV-movie-of-the-week', 'treatment', 'serious', 'mental', 'illness', 'hardly', 'definitive', 'cinematic', 'treatment', 'autism', 'health', 'classes', 'America', 'be', ""'d"", 'probably', 'get', 'more', 'illumination', 'PBS', 'documentary', 'subject', 'here', 'So', 'mildly', 'moving', 'moments', 'good', 'performances', 'RAIN', 'MAN', 'disappointment', 'certainly', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'sure', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'more', 'just', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'winner']",N/A
135197,A2Q07KQAAFWVL7,0792833260,Kristoffer Infante,"[14, 19]","What can you say about a movie that deals with a subject not usually tackled? Of course, there was 1968's CHARLY, starring Cliff Robertson (Best Actor Oscar-winner) and Claire Bloom, that gave us an in-depth look at &quot;special&quot; people, mostly especially, autistic people.Dustin Hoffman is Raymond Babbitt, the titular character. Tom Cruise, in an excellent role that even impressed me (and I'm not at all a Tom Cruise fan) plays his conniving, selfish brother Charlie Babbitt. Thrown in the mix with them is the beautiful Italian actress Valeria Golino, who plays Cruise's compassionate girlfriend.You have to love this film! Why? Because of two men, Cruise and Best Actor winner Hoffman (winning his second award since 1979's KRAMER VS. KRAMER). They are what pulls us into their world, and keeps us there until the very end when Charlie sadly puts Raymond on a train back to the sanitorium. (I admit, as a man, I cried repeatedly during this scene -- and still do!) It begins with the death of the brothers' father, a rich man who was estranged from Charlie and never even spoken about Raymond. When he dies, Charlie is given a beautiful 1940s convertible (and his father's prize roses). Upon hearing that this brother of his has inherited their father's fortune, Charlie decides to find him and eventually &quot;kidnap&quot; him.His greedy selfishness is obvious from the first scene of the film. Eventually, his girlfriend has enough of this and leaves him alone with his brother. (She eventually comes back to him in Las Vegas.) During their cross-country journey, Charlie realizes how important having a brother is, citing that he always felt alone and that how happy he was to know that Raymond was his brother. Beautiful and human, yet not too sappy and saccharine! Even though Charlie proves to have an alterior motive for Raymond, you can't help but like the character (since he does provide some laughs). Cruise eventually plays the same character in 1996's JERRY MAGUIRE.And, of course, there's Hoffman! Virtually stealing every scene he is in. From his quips: &quot;I'm an excellent driver&quot; to his Abbott &amp; Costello &quot;Who's on First&quot; bit, you can't help but fall in love with this silly, but poignant character. What also clinches the tears for me, other than the departing scene on the train, are the end credits. Yes, that's right, the credits! Here's why. Even notice that Raymond is taking pictures? If you do, then you should know that those are the pictures taken in the end credits. We're actually SEEING what Raymond is seeing; that, in itself, is heartbreaking!

But what Rain Man did do was give people an understanding of some of the challenges of autism and paved the way for a far wider public reception of the literary works of people with autism (Nobody Nowhere, Emergence, Lucy's Story etc) which generally went on to challenge the existing stereotypes with the consequence that the incidence of autism was seen to explode from 1 in 10,000 to around 1 in 160 people today.

He virtually disappears into the character of Raymond, and wows the audience. It must have taken a lot of work to play such a character, and other actors might have failed, but Dustin wins hands down. The vacant stare, the monotone voice, the screaming, is all spot on.This is not my favourite Tom Cruise performance, as he acts like a complete SOB in this, but it's great the way his character changes throughout the movie, and by the end, I like him a lot more.

The story of a man discovering his mentally-handicapped brother in the wake of his father's death and then being forced to take that brother to Los Angeles by car in order to obtain the monitory inheritance he feels entitled to is pretty good on its own, but these two make it shine.  I enjoyed every one of their interactions, with the practice sessions right before Vegas being among my favorite scenes.  I also really liked Valeria Golino as Tom Cruise's girlfriend and I'm glad the filmmakers dropped their idea to make the character a blond from Malibu or somewhere like that.  Having a foreign character like this woman only enhanced the plot.  I especially liked the scene where Tom Cruise has to explain the meaning of the phrase ""pulled over"" to her...I don't know why...I just do.  This film is sweet, touching, and enjoyable without ever overdoing anything.  It's ending is sweet, but far from generically sweet.  Congrats to the filmmakers on a job well done!

135224,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,0792833260,P Magnum,"[3, 6]","1988's Rain Man is the story of a young, greedily ambitious car dealer, Charlie Babbitt, who travels from Los Angeles to Cincinnati after his father passes away.  Expecting to be left his father's millions, he finds he is only left with some rose bushes and a classic Buick convertible.  Even more shocking to Charlie is that he finds out the millions have been left to a brother he never knew he had.  His brother, Raymond, is much older and confined to an institution because he is afflicted with autism.  Charlie takes Raymond out of the institution and wants to take him back to L.A. in order to bilk him out of the money.  After Raymond refuses to fly, they set off on a cross-country journey in the Buick.  Initially, Charlie is uncaring and unsympathetic to Raymond.  Raymond is a creature of routine and any deviation from it causes him to become worried and troubled.  Eventually, Charlie softens up and grows to care for his brother and gives in to his routines, but also helps Raymond break some of them.  Dustin Hoffman won his second Best Actor Oscar for his role as Raymond and Tom Cruise gave his first serious and critically acclaimed performance as Charlie.  The film won three other Oscars including Best Picture, Best Director for Barry Levinson and Best Original Screenplay for writers Ronald Bass &amp; Barry Morrow. The film can get a little tedious and cloying spots and while Mr. Hoffman's performance is clearly genuine and heart felt, but he sometimes falls into an almost cartoon character with his mannerisms.  That being said, Rain Man is a highly entertaining film that will make you laugh and cry.",4,Long Long Brother,1045180800,"02 14, 2003",2003,1628,"['1988', 'Rain', 'Man', 'story', 'young', 'greedily', 'ambitious', 'car', 'dealer', 'Charlie', 'Babbitt', 'who', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Cincinnati', 'father', 'away', 'Expecting', 'be', 'left', 'father', 'millions', 'only', 'left', 'rose', 'bushes', 'classic', 'Buick', 'convertible', 'Even', 'more', 'shocking', 'Charlie', 'out', 'millions', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'brother', 'never', 'knew', 'had', 'brother', 'Raymond', 'much', 'older', 'confined', 'institution', 'afflicted', 'autism', 'Charlie', 'Raymond', 'institution', 'take', 'back', 'L.A.', 'order', 'bilk', 'money', 'Raymond', 'fly', 'set', 'off', 'cross-country', 'journey', 'Buick', 'Initially', 'Charlie', 'uncaring', 'unsympathetic', 'Raymond', 'Raymond', 'creature', 'routine', 'deviation', 'become', 'worried', 'troubled', 'Eventually', 'Charlie', 'up', 'grows', 'care', 'brother', 'routines', 'also', 'Raymond', 'break', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'won', 'second', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'role', 'Raymond', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'gave', 'first', 'serious', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'performance', 'Charlie', 'film', 'won', 'three', 'other', 'Oscars', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'Barry', 'Levinson', 'Best', 'Original', 'Screenplay', 'writers', 'Ronald', 'Bass', 'amp', 'Barry', 'Morrow', 'film', 'can', 'get', 'little', 'tedious', 'cloying', 'spots', 'Mr.', 'Hoffman', 'performance', 'clearly', 'genuine', 'heart', 'felt', 'sometimes', 'almost', 'cartoon', 'character', 'mannerisms', 'being', 'said', 'Rain', 'Man', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'cry']",N/A

I watched this movie for the first time to see what all the hype was.  It wasn't so great.  Dustin Hoffman utters a few grunts of words and maybe speaks a few lines, and Tom Cruise shows himself as a successful but greedy brother claiming that he wants to bring his brother back into his life, though he never knew him before, but you can see that he's basically appreciating his brother's candid card counting skills.  So, of course, they are on their way to Las Vegas.I will say though that this movie does support why I don't gamble.  Casinos love it if you blow your money on chance.  Empty your wallet on gambling and then just go home.  But, if you're someone who has mastered card counting (which I'm sure all casino dealers do), than you are asked to leave.

It is gimmick that is used to differentiate this film from the number of films that had previously dealt with the same material.  At its core, this is a story about family secrets, personal discovery, and reconciliation.  Only this time around, one of the members of the family is autistic.After his father passes away, Charlie Babbitt's (Tom Cruise) life changes forever when he discovers he has brother he never knew he had.  Compounding his surprise is the fact that Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) is an autistic who can perform amazing mental feats with little effort.  However, Raymond is unable to interact socially with others and is continuously thwarted by the world outside upon leaving his institution.  After much soul-searching, Charlie must decide if his brother's interests would be better served staying at home with him or back at the institution with its comfortable daily routine.The two performances at the heart of &quot;Rain Man&quot; are flawless.  Cruise is great as the fast-talking brother whose cold heart thaws as he spends more time with his brother and Hoffman's Academy Award for his performance is testament enough to its quality.  However, while watching &quot;Rain Man,&quot; you cannot shake the feeling that the events unfolding on-screen are just an excuse to display Raymond's talents.  All of the scenes from his recitation of baseball statistics to his ability to count toothpicks on the floor to his success in Las Vegas feel like gimmicky set pieces.  Little drama is produced the rest of the time as the scenes without Raymond are just filler to bridge the gaps between his previous spotlight moment and his next one.  In the end there is surprisingly little in the film to sustain the viewer's interest.

This son, Raymond (Dustin Hoffman), is autitstic, and Charlie decides in order to get his hands on the inheritence he will pull Raymond from the home and take of him himself. What follows is a touching story of the acceptance and understanding of people who are challenged, yet special, as well as a story of changing one's outlook on life as Charlie is forced to examine his own personna and to drop his conniving ways to care for his brother. This piece of work is some of the best Cruise has ever done and it's the best film Hoffman has ever acted in. It was no surprise the film became a huge boxoffice hit and garnered four Oscars, including Best Actor for Hoffman, Best Screenplay, Best Director for Barry Levinson (who has a cameo in the film), and Best Picture of 1988. The DVD is not really a ""special edition"" version, although we do have a few extras like the trailer and a minor featurette with an interview with the stars.

135250,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,0792833260,Themis-Athena,"[80, 88]","Have you ever had to communicate with someone on a different wavelength as you; for example because he speaks a foreign language and you don't have an interpreter, or because he is unable to communicate verbally at all, or maybe just because you keep misunderstanding each other?  If so, you know what a frustrating experience it is to have virtually no control over the situation and over making sure that you're actually understood.  And in precisely this situation finds himself Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise), personification of the 1980s' yuppie, a used car dealer with major money problems whose only - tentative - personal attachment is to his current girlfriend Susanna (Valeria Golino).  Because having learned that except for a few rosebushes and a vintage 1949 Buick Roadmaster his recently-deceased father has left virtually all of his considerable fortune to his autistic brother Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) - a brother he didn't even know he had - Charlie decides to kidnap Raymond from the Cincinnati facility where he lives, take him to California, and demand half the inheritance in exchange for his brother's return.Now, Charlie isn't the greatest communicator himself; at least as far as listening goes; he is used to talking people down, and if that alone doesn't do the trick, he starts to yell.  This, however, just doesn't work with Raymond, who lives in a world of his own and, unable to express emotion in any other way, falls into a nervous tic when feeling threatened.  So for the first time in his life Charlie has to learn to accept another human being for what he is, and work *with* his bewildering methods of communication rather than against them.  And subtly, very subtly, Charlie begins to change, until at last he no longer wants to relinquish custody of Raymond even after having been offered a substantial amount of money:  because now money is no longer an issue at all; now it's all about genuine love for a newly-found brother and very special person.""Rain Man"" is ostensibly told from Charlie's perspective; through his, the ""normal"" guy's eyes we perceive Raymond's habits, tics and strange behavioral code.  And even if Charlie is easy enough to snub for his superficiality and materialism, his frustration at his inability to communicate with his brother feels genuine and is something we can empathize with(albeit perhaps inadmittedly).  Tom Cruise plays Charlie with a finely-tuned mix of audacity and reluctant emotion; turning a role that seems to start out as just another Cruise cliche into a character who hesitantly comes to realize his own complexities and shortcomings and learns to appreciate sensitivity, compassion and love - yet, without ever taking the role that treacherous step too far into sentimentality.Still, important as Charlie's character is for this movie's narrative, this is from first to last Raymond's story; and by the same token Dustin Hoffman's, because the two individuals are in fact inseparable:  As Hoffman once explained in an interview, he rejects the notion that acting is merely about playing a role, or that the term ""my character"" could ever appropriately describe his approach to a role; emphasizing that in every part he plays, he truly has to *become* the individual in question to fully be able to understand and portray him.  As such, his achievement with Raymond Babbitt is breathtaking indeed; for in a role which not only imposes severe limitations on his ability to communicate traditionally but also gives him virtually no opportunity to express emotion, he conveys Raymond's frailties, unexpected strengths and, significantly, his profound humanity in a manner that lets you forget you're even looking at a piece of acting, thus accomplishing that rare feat only attained by the greatest of actors - and even among Dustin Hoffman's spectacular performances, this one stands out in particular.  (He did, of course, win both the Oscar and the Golden Globe for this movie; but somehow even the industry's highest awards don't begin to express the significance of his achievement.)Raymond Babbitt's character was based on several real-life autistic persons; and at a time when little was known about the condition even in the medical community, contributed substantially to a greater understanding of those afflicted with it.  Not all autistic people are so-called ""savants"" like Raymond, i.e. possess genial mathematic or other abilities within the shell separating them from the outside world (and conversely, not with all of them that shell is as thick as in Raymond's case; although intricate routines do tend to play a rather important role) - so don't go rushing off with them to Vegas for an exercise in ""counting cards,"" at least not before you've verified that they can memorize entire phone books (at least up to the letter ""G""), count the toothpicks in a pile on the floor with one glimpse of an eye and determine the square root of a four- or five-digit number within a matter of seconds without so much as looking at an electronic calculator.  Chances are you'd do them tremendous harm, not to mention make a complete fool of yourself.Dustin Hoffman reportedly fought hard for this movie's production even after several directors (including, inter alia, Stephen Spielberg) had bowed out; and in one of those rare un-Hollywood-like moments even managed to maintain the movie's sense of authenticity up to the very end by prevailing on the writers to drop the projected ending, which would have had Raymond staying with Charlie. - In addition to Hoffman's awards, ""Rain Man"" received the coveted Oscars for Best Movie, Best Original Screenplay and Best Director (Barry Levinson, who also played the psychiatrist called upon to evaluate whether Raymond is fit to stay with Charlie), plus a number of other American and international awards.  For once, the industry collectively got it right.  But even if this movie hadn't received a single award, it would still remain one of recent film history's greatest and truly unforgettable moments - definitely, it would.Also recommended:The Curious

135258,AP3B615GM191G,0792833260,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","&#34;Rain Man&#34; is the type of movie that, by the eye test, shouldn't hold up as well as it does.  Made in 1988, it has Tom Cruise playing an 80's yuppie, Valeria Golino as his girlfriend, and just the way that it is shot screams &#34;80's movie&#34; all the way around.  It manages to hold up very well, though, due to the touching story/acting combination between the principle characters.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees Charlie Babbitt (Cruise), estranged son of a very wealthy father, finally coming back home upon his father's death to &#34;see what he gets&#34;.  When Charlie discovers that his family fortune has been placed in a mysterious trust, he packs up girlfriend Susanna (Golino) for a road trip to discover just what is going on.  What he finds is a mysterious, eccentric autistic savant named Raymond (Dustin Hoffman), who ends up being much more than meets the eye.The chemistry between the Cruise/Hoffman characters is the fuel that fires this Academy Award-winning masterpiece.  Cruise is always solid, and Hoffman turns in the kind of special performance that I now almost exclusively associate his name with.  Their give-and-take with each other is priceless and provides some iconic cinema moments that will last long into the ages.Also, it can sometimes be difficult to make a movie about any type of mental illness (e.g. they often come off as too patronizing or sympathetic), but director Barry Levinson creates the type of story where he lets the viewers decide &#34;what is what&#34; instead of preaching to them.  By the end of the film, you won't know what the &#34;right answer&#34; is.Overall, &#34;Rain Main&#34; is a dramatic gem that will forever hold at the very least a niche in Hollywood lore for its unique performances.  My exact rating for the film would be 4.5 stars.  It may not quite be in that upper echelon of the &#34;best of the best&#34;, but it is certainly knocking on the door.",4,"Should Be More Cliched/Dated Than It Is, But Still Manages To Hold Up Well.",1387756800,"12 23, 2013",2013,1943,"['34', 'Rain', 'Man', '34', 'type', 'movie', 'eye', 'test', 'should', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'Made', '1988', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'playing', '80', 'yuppie', 'Valeria', 'Golino', 'girlfriend', 'just', 'way', 'shot', 'screams', '34', '80', 'movie', '34', 'way', 'hold', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'due', 'touching', 'story/acting', 'combination', 'principle', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'movie', 'Charlie', 'Babbitt', 'Cruise', 'estranged', 'son', 'very', 'wealthy', 'father', 'finally', 'coming', 'back', 'home', 'father', 'death', '34', 'see', 'what', '34', 'When', 'Charlie', 'family', 'fortune', 'been', 'placed', 'mysterious', 'trust', 'up', 'girlfriend', 'Susanna', 'Golino', 'road', 'trip', 'discover', 'just', 'what', 'going', 'What', 'mysterious', 'eccentric', 'autistic', 'savant', 'named', 'Raymond', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'up', 'being', 'much', 'more', 'eye.The', 'chemistry', 'Cruise/Hoffman', 'characters', 'fuel', 'Academy', 'Award-winning', 'masterpiece', 'Cruise', 'always', 'solid', 'Hoffman', 'kind', 'special', 'performance', 'now', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'associate', 'name', 'give-and-take', 'other', 'priceless', 'iconic', 'cinema', 'moments', 'will', 'last', 'long', 'ages.Also', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'difficult', 'make', 'movie', 'type', 'mental', 'illness', 'e.g', 'often', 'come', 'off', 'too', 'patronizing', 'sympathetic', 'director', 'Barry', 'Levinson', 'type', 'story', 'where', 'viewers', 'decide', '34', 'what', 'what', '34', 'instead', 'preaching', 'end', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', '34', 'right', 'answer', '34', 'is.Overall', '34', 'Rain', 'Main', '34', 'dramatic', 'gem', 'will', 'forever', 'hold', 'very', 'least', 'niche', 'Hollywood', 'lore', 'unique', 'performances', 'exact', 'rating', 'film', 'would', 'be', '4.5', 'stars', 'may', 'not', 'quite', 'be', 'upper', 'echelon', '34', 'best', 'best', '34', 'certainly', 'knocking', 'door']",N/A
