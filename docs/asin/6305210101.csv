454479,A35QF1GDLAFYCL,6305210101,"A. Calabrese ""othernj""","[5, 7]","About a month ago I heard an interview with the writer, Sherman Alexie. As they say in the old movies ""I really liked the cut of his jib.""  He talked about his writing and this film called Smoke Signals.  The interviewer, who happens to be a movie critic, gave it high praise.  So on to Amazon I went and ordered this DVD.  This is a wonderful little movie about friendship and family.  The direction, by Chris Eyre, is great and the movie is visually appealing, with notable dialogue.  (Sherman Alexie wrote the screenplay.)  Victor as played by Adam Beach had a troubled childhood marked by all things that plague Native Americans in 20th Century United States.  Throughout his life he has been befriended by Thomas, played supperbly by Evan Adams.  Thomas was saved, as a small child, by Victor's father.  Victor's father has been gone from the family for 10 years.  Victor is full of swagger and self-confidence, Thomas on the other hand is kind of a nerdy nudge.  But, God puts us where He wants us and it seems that it is Thomas' mission, so to speak, to help Victor come to terms with his past.  Smoke Signals should be seen by all and shown in most of our school systems.  I think a lot of stereotypes about Native Americans still prevail in this society.  The screenwriter does an excellent job of showing us that Native Americans are people, who in many ways, deal with the same issues you and I do, but also have the added burden of a social structure that seems ever in conflict.  Buy this DVD watch it, but watch it with your family.

454482,ATAH0T2AWB24Z,6305210101,Astral Traveler,"[33, 41]","I just browsed through the basically unanimously positive reviews here and thought I'd offer a somewhat dissenting opinion.  After all, most of the  reviews on Amazon.com tend to be positive, since the people who visit any  given listing are usually people who enjoyed the film, music, book, etc.  I'm a fan of Sherman Alexie's writing, which I find fresh, unique, totally  engaging and entertaing.  I had eagerly anticipated the release of Smoke  Signals when I had heard Alexie was writing the screenplay.  I left the  theater on opening day very dissapointed.Part of the problem was of  course that it was an adaptation of stories that I was already quite fond  of.  I didn't appreciate the attempt to make Thomas Builds the Fire so  cutesy, when I had envisioned him as quirky and strange (in a good way).  I  can still hear the girls sitting behind me going &quot;awwww&quot;  everytime he said anything.  I like to think of Thomas as a guy most people  wouldn't get, but the character in the movie seemed clearly designed to  create the above response.  It also lacked the freshness of Alexie's  written voice.  Had it not had Native American characters, it would be  indistinguishable from hundreds of other ensemble type coming of age road  films.  My feeling was that this was essentially an attempt to make a  commerical film created by Native Americans.  I think that had Hollywood  ever the guts to make a movie that didn't feature whites or blacks as the  main characters and they decided to make a film with Native characters,  something not too disimilar from Smoke Signals would have been the  result.That said, the film wasn't BAD.  But it wasn't great or  outstanding... unless you want to listen to every single one of the 86  reviews before mine :-)  Anyway, that's my opinion, and I hope Alexie's  next film project lives up to my expectations.",3,dissenting opinion,966384000,"08 16, 2000",2000,1865,"['just', 'browsed', 'basically', 'unanimously', 'positive', 'reviews', 'here', 'thought', ""'d"", 'offer', 'somewhat', 'dissenting', 'opinion', 'most', 'reviews', 'Amazon.com', 'tend', 'be', 'positive', 'people', 'who', 'visit', 'given', 'listing', 'are', 'usually', 'people', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'music', 'book', 'etc', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Sherman', 'Alexie', 'writing', 'find', 'fresh', 'unique', 'totally', 'engaging', 'entertaing', 'had', 'eagerly', 'anticipated', 'release', 'Smoke', 'Signals', 'when', 'had', 'heard', 'Alexie', 'was', 'writing', 'screenplay', 'left', 'theater', 'opening', 'day', 'very', 'dissapointed.Part', 'problem', 'was', 'course', 'was', 'adaptation', 'stories', 'was', 'already', 'quite', 'fond', 'did', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'attempt', 'make', 'Thomas', 'Builds', 'Fire', 'cutesy', 'when', 'had', 'envisioned', 'quirky', 'strange', 'good', 'way', 'can', 'still', 'hear', 'girls', 'sitting', 'going', 'quot', 'quot', 'said', 'anything', 'like', 'think', 'Thomas', 'guy', 'most', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'character', 'movie', 'seemed', 'clearly', 'designed', 'create', 'above', 'response', 'also', 'lacked', 'freshness', 'Alexie', 'written', 'voice', 'Had', 'not', 'had', 'Native', 'American', 'characters', 'would', 'be', 'indistinguishable', 'hundreds', 'other', 'ensemble', 'type', 'coming', 'age', 'road', 'films', 'feeling', 'was', 'was', 'essentially', 'attempt', 'make', 'commerical', 'film', 'created', 'Native', 'Americans', 'think', 'had', 'Hollywood', 'ever', 'guts', 'make', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'feature', 'whites', 'blacks', 'main', 'characters', 'decided', 'make', 'film', 'Native', 'characters', 'something', 'not', 'too', 'disimilar', 'Smoke', 'Signals', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'result.That', 'said', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'BAD', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'outstanding', 'want', 'listen', 'single', 'one', '86', 'reviews', 'mine', 'Anyway', 'opinion', 'hope', 'Alexie', 'next', 'film', 'project', 'up', 'expectations']",Smoke Signals VHS

454485,A2YM0JQI2IO0VS,6305210101,"B. Berthold ""brad13""","[13, 14]","A goliath of a question from a David of a film.  I first saw this film some two years ago and at that time it seemed like an indigenous Thelma and Louise. Quaint and light, nothing too shattering.  Then recently, inspired by Pow-Wow Highway, I decided to dust off the old VCR and give this film another chance.  And I'm glad I did because Smoke Signals has more than meets the eye. A lot more.It takes place in a very forgotten corner of America within America, the reservation.  To be precise, the Coeur D'Alenes Reservation of Northwest Washington. Here, KREZ radio keeps the inertia and despair at bay with the occasional traffic reports, 'Two cars passed by this morning,'and some very witty one-liners, 'It's a great day to be indigenous.'  Everything is bit different than in that 'foreign' land of the United States. As one great scene shows, don't despair if your car has gear problems, drive it in reverse.  Here, writer Sherman Alexie provides a piercing metaphor on how the Native American has fought off assimilation.  By doing it their way.The film centers around two boyhood friends who have grown up among broken families.  Victor is the stereotypical Indian macho. Plaid short, jeans, boots and beautiful hair blowing in the breeze, he hides his childhood anger amidst scowls of contempt.  As he instructs his friend, Thomas, 'You gotta look stoic if you want to be a real Indian!'  Thomas is anything but stoic.  With coke-bottle glasses and pony-tail braids, Thomas is as kind and thoughtful as his 'unwarrior-like' appearence suggests.  Although not brothers by blood, fate soon corrects that.  It all starts when Victor's mercurial, alcoholic father, Arnold Joseph (once again Gary Farmer steals the show) drunkenly and accidentally sets Thomas's house ablaze. His parents doomed, they throw little Thomas out the window, where the drunken Arnold barely catches him.  What a start to life.  Saved by the person who caused your parents' death.  Such is Thomas' beginning.  Raised by his grandmother, he nonetheless shares a special relationship with Victor's dad.  It is no wonder that Arnold takes special care of Thomas, often neglecting Victor in the process.  Eyre does a beautiful job of interweaving the present with scenes from the boys' childhood especially with those flashbacks of drunken family parties where the defiant Victor tries to understand his blurred parents.The morning-after daze clears up, the arguments set in, and once again little Victor is the victim of mom and dad's quarrelling.  Tormented by their dismal lifestyle, Arnold decides to escape and sets out for the desert with his pick-up, leaving mother and child to fend for themselves. And this is where the journey begins.  Victor (and Thomas) soon learn of Arnold's unexpected death.  His ashes are waiting for his sons.  So, they decide to Greyhound their way to dad.  One dad and two very different sons.  Victor sees the trip as an unpleasant necessity.  Bring home a cowardly, abusive drunk.  For him, Dad meant only painful punches and beer-breath.  For Thomas, Arnold was the beer-bellied Santa Claus who picked him when he was down, who took him to Denny's for the Big Breakfast. Two sons, one father.  Eventually they make it to the Phoenix trailer park where Arnold lived in desert solitude.  Here they meet Suzy Song, Arnold's friend(girlfriend?) who tells of their father's last days.  Days filled with regret and remorse over having abandonned his family, over having caused the deaths of Thomas' parents, over having made so many mistakes.  Arnold came to the desert to put on the ash-cloth, to clean himself, to understand himself and finally, to forgive himself.  Suzy tells Victor who his father really was: yes, a weak man, tormented by his demons, but also a good man who loved his sons and hungered to see them again.  Victor is then left with a hard choice: carry his meaningless resentment forever or forgive and accept his father.Needless to say, this film has a gold mine of messages in it.  And a lot of wisdom for us all.  It's more than just a 'road movie.' Or better yet, it is what a road movie should be.  A painful and joyful journey towards a definite goal.  Smoke Signals takes us back to our own childhood and teaches us about what awaits us there in the desert.  Reconciliation. Peace. And most of all, a way back to the love that was always there.  I recommend this film to all especially to those fathers and sons who haven't yet travelled this road.

454486,A2582KMXLK2P06,6305210101,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","Smoke Signals is about two young Native American men that get an urge to travel to Phoenix.  Now, these two are drastically different both appearance and personality-wise.  The taller more mature one is the handsome and knowledgeable guy, while the other is a geeky talkative kid that smiles a lot and likes to have fun.  The mature one has to frequently remind the other that he's not going to be taken seriously by the white population acting the way he does and he better change the way he conducts himself, and fast.Now I'm not sure if certain white people really are indifferent towards Native Americans up in the northwest Idaho territory in this day and age (or in 1998 when this movie was released) but the good news is that the story being told here is innocent and much friendlier than I went in expecting.  The violence is kept between the two men and never escalates into the white people coming into the picture and having a problem with them or anything of that nature.  This captures what I always believed the way Native Americans are like (proud of their roots and normally extra polite and spiritual) however I could be wrong since I don't know any of them personally- just the culture I see on TV programs and movies.Anyway, there's more to this storyline than simply two guys travelling to Phoenix together on a bus.  We also see flashbacks throughout the movie concerning both of these men when they were just kids and how the father of the mature Native American was an alcoholic that had a regrettably lousy relationship with his son and wife resulting in the father just up and leaving one day.  From what I could tell, the two Native American men unintentionally happen upon the girlfriend (or friend) of the father that could reveal what the father was *really* like.  I wasn't quite sure if the two finding this woman's trailer out in the desert was an intentional visit or just chance.The best part of the film comes during the final 20 minutes.

I was not to be disappointed.Smoke Signals is the story of a boy, Victor Joseph, who is a native american, dealing with his ties to his father in a society as alien to many Europeans as any sci fi author could portray.  The story weaves its way through Joseph's life, from birth, to coming of age and dealing with the death of his father.  It also deals with the world of friendship, talismanism, cowboys versus 'indians,' and redemption of all of these things...and more.If you are expecting to see big name actors in this movie, then I'm sorry to say that you will be sorely disappointed.  The only 'big name' actor I saw was Tom Skerritt and he did a poor job.

454494,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,6305210101,C. B Collins Jr.,"[4, 4]","This film has far more depth than a typical comedy. In fact, the comedy here is wise and gentle. Whereas I found much of the film humorous, there is a message about the long road to forgiveness and the difficulty of self-acceptance that is very well presented here in the primary character of a young Native man, Victor.The story revolves around a handsome young Native man, Victor, and the painful experiences he had as a child and youth and as a young man around his relationship with his alcoholic father and himself. The story is also the story of his father, Joseph, and the events he sets in play due to his all too human faults and weaknesses. The story is also the story of Thomas, an odd fellow, who in many ways is a catalyst toward Victor's emotional growth.Joseph is an alcoholic Native man with a tense relationship with his son, Victor. Alcohol leads Joseph into tragedy, guilt, domestic violence, and alienation from a fine and loving wife and a fine young son. Victor perceives that his father loves alcohol more than he loves his family. This appears to be proven correct when Victor's mother insists that the family become alcohol free and Joseph leaves the family when Victor is around 8 years old, never to return to the reservation and family again. When Joseph dies, and the family gets a phone call from his Native neighbor in Arizona, his son Victor and family friend Thomas, must travel from Idaho to Arizona to claim the ashes and dispose of Joseph's belongings.The character of Thomas requires some analysis at this point. Thomas was a tiny baby when his parents died in a house fire and Thomas was thrown from a window, caught by Joseph, and then reared by his elderly grandmother. He is oddly unworldly, spiritual and naive, lacking in common sense but acting as a constant irritant to Victor regarding the major emotional force in his life, his feelings of abandonment and loss of love around his father's flight from the family and the reservation on which they live. Victor is never allowed to allow his negative feelings to become deeply buried in his psyche because of the constant irritating comments of Thomas around Joseph's flight. Thomas is the classic trickster in world religions for he appears foolish and lacking in social sense but his constant questions to Victor help spur Victor toward resolution of his inner turmoil. The role of the trickster is to help someone face that which they do not wish to face. He is known as Hermes in Greek myth and Mercury in Roman myth and Coyote in many Native stories. Emotional pain is much like a worm in that it digs deeper and deeper and appears to be gone, but it lies hidden and painfully erupts in relationships and interactions, even at an unconscious level so that we can be victims of long buried hurtful experiences that impact our current lives. This is the primary contribution of Sigmund Freud to world philosophy. However, the trickster, more akin to the psychology of Carl Jung, never lets the pain dig too deep, realizing that the worm must be frequently tricked into showing himself if he is every to be caught. Thomas is the trickster for Victor. His odd questions keep Victor's pain right on the surface.The literal path of Victor and Thomas is also the emotional and spiritual path for Victor. He obtains the ashes of his father but wishes to flee. Thomas forces him to stay and interact with a young Native woman who befriended Joseph. She sees Joseph in a very different way than Victor. She sees that he loved his family and was able to give up alcohol, but was never able to face the failures of his life. These include the terrible house fire and his relationships with his wife and son. Victor must enter the trailer in the desert where his father dies and go through his belongings. Again this is a symbol from many world religions of the courage required to go in depth into the pain one feels inside to face the monster. The trailer smells of death and yet Victor continues. He finds only mundane items until he finds his father's wallet, in which there is a picture of the family with the word 'home' written on the back. Victor becomes much more aware, thankfully for him, that his father was a mixture of good and bad, like us all. He opens up to the ambiguity of feelings he feels and allows himself to feel the grief of the loss of his father. This duality of feelings and perceptions is symbolized when Victor gives Thomas half of his father's ashes, for in many ways Thomas sees Joseph as a man who always showed him affection and saved him from the house fire. Joseph takes him to Denny's for a breakfast and this meal is symbolic of the support of a father for a child. Joseph was not much of a father to Victor, but through a random act of kindness, he became a mythic and spiritual father for Thomas.  Thomas is an odd spiritual creature who can live a lifetime with such glimpses of fatherhood. However Victor required the real thing, the real flesh and blood immediate father, which Joseph can not provide when burdened with guilt, failure, and alcoholism.Thomas gives us odd sayings throughout the film, but in the end he tells Victor to throw the ashes into the raging river in Spokane so that his father can become a salmon. What a fine symbol for forgiveness when we allow the pain to leave and swim upriver.",5,Forgive you father so he can become a salmon.,1191801600,"10 8, 2007",2007,5336,"['film', 'far', 'more',

454498,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6305210101,C. O. DeRiemer,"[3, 3]","The more you try to describe a movie like Smoke Signals the likelier it is that you'll kill it. The story basically is about a son who eventually reaches some understanding concerning his father, who left the family years ago. The discovery and acceptance by the resentful Victor Joseph of his father's own unhappiness plays out in a road trip Victor and his friend, Thomas Builds-the-Fire, take from the Coeur d'Alene Indian Reservation in Idaho where they live to Phoenix to pick up the father's ashes. This sort of story has been so often turgidly overplayed by film-makers searching for ""truth"" that it's a surprise to find just how touching and humorous Smoke Signals turns out to be. The story may be about a search of discovery, but it's played out against the friction of reservation life in a white world. The humor carries a lot of irony but the dialog and situations are so gentle and natural that the inherent messages don't slam us about. There's no victim card being played here, just some truths told with the kind of underplayed honesty that makes ethnic humor, delivered by those same ethnic people, work not just for them but for those in a white world who are overhearing.Victor Joseph (Adam Beach) is a big, good looking young man who barely gets along, plays basketball and carries a chip on his shoulder. Thomas Builds-the-Fire (Evan Adams) is a scrawny, glasses-wearing young man who tells stories and talks about almost everything. Thomas has been raised by his grandmother. A fire killed his parents and it was Victor's father, Arnold Joseph (Gary Farmer), who caught Thomas, just a baby, when Thomas was tossed from a second floor window. Arnold Joseph was a big man, quick to laugh and quick to hit, maybe not a drunk but close to it. He denied being a hero. One day, when Victor was about 12, Arnold Joseph picked up and left. Victor never forgave him. When word of Arnold's death reaches Victor's mother. Victor decides he must get the ashes, but he doesn't have enough money. ""Hey Victor!"" Thomas says, ""I'm sorry 'bout your dad."" ""How'd you hear about it?"" Victor asks. ""I heard it on the wind,"" Thomas says, ""I heard it from the birds. I felt it in the sunlight. And your mom was just in here cryin'."" Thomas has some money in a jar and offers it if he can come along. Off they go, hitchhiking, taking a bus, walking. Along the way, while Victor wrestles with his feelings about the father who left him, screenwriter Sherman Alexie and director Chris Eyre give us the kind of edgy smiles that are rare nowadays. ""You gotta look mean or people won't respect you,"" says Victor to Thomas on the bus to Phoenix. ""White people will run all over you if you don't look mean. You gotta look like a warrior! You gotta look like you just came back from killing a buffalo!"" ""But our tribe never hunted buffalo -- we were fishermen,"" says Thomas. ""What!"" says Victor, ""you want to look like you just came back from catching a fish? This ain't 'Dances With Salmon' you know!""Yes, they return to the reservations with the ashes. Victor winds up learning a lot about himself as well as about his father. He learns a good deal about what Thomas reaches for with all the stories Thomas tells. We learn a lot about the value of a quiet movie with a fine screenplay and skillful direction. We learn about fry bread. And as Thomas says, when the going gets tough, ""Sometimes it's a good day to die, and sometimes it's a good day to have breakfast.""All the actors do commendable jobs, but Evan Adams is a standout. When he closes his eyes and starts to spin one of Thomas' stories, you don't really want him to stop. Adams has the challenging job of bringing us to the movie's close, emotionally and thoughtfully. ""Do we forgive our fathers in our age or in theirs, or in their deaths, saying it to them, or not saying it?

454500,A3C1Q9TRP83BYB,6305210101,Daniel A. Brown,"[0, 0]","On the Coeur D'Alene reservation in Idaho, not much seems to be happening, as witnessed by the deadpan ""traffic"" and ""weather"" reports of local radio KREZ. But for two young men, Victor Joseph (Adam Beach) and Thomas Builds-the-Fire, (Evan Adams) their lives became entwined when as babies, Victor's father, Arnold (Gary Farmer), saved Thomas's life in a fire that consumed his parents. Arnold, an abusive alcoholic who was traumatized by the tragedy, deserts his family and eventually dies in his trailer in the Arizona desert. The two boys, who have a grating love-hate relationship, travel down to retrieve his remains. Victor is all bottled rage behind his set smile. Thomas is like a tactless Jiminy Cricket, forcing his friend to face his currently unbearable reality. Meeting Suzy Song (Irene Bedard), a neighbor (and surrogate daughter) of Arnold's, the circle of all their lives comes into completion. This film is not so much an ""Indian"" movie as it is a fable about such universal themes of family, betrayal, forgiveness, and redemption seen through Native American eyes. As such, it crosses all ethnic barriers. What makes ""Smoke Signals"" special is how easily it works on several levels, not only past and present, but physical and ethereal as well. All the main characters seem to have two identities that are constantly shifting, their frail humanity giving way to a deep and potent spirit. In particular, Evan Adams's Thomas, all nerdy glasses and geek manner, is revealed as an Old Man Coyote storyteller, whose brazenly outlandish tales carry wisdom and power. The ending scene on a nameless Spokane bridge reaches a level of emotional intensity that mainstream movies are unable (or unwilling) to touch. The first film ever produced, directed, and acted by Native Americans, it won various awards at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival. The poignant soundtrack includes native acappella group Ulali and the hilarious chant, ""John Wayne's Teeth"". Adapted from the story ""The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven"" by Sherman Alexie (who also wrote the screenplay).",5,Universal Themes from a Native American perspective,1224979200,"10 26, 2008",2008,2082,"['Coeur', ""D'Alene"", 'reservation', 'Idaho', 'not', 'much', 'be', 'happening', 'witnessed', 'deadpan', 'traffic', 'weather', 'reports', 'local', 'radio', 'KREZ', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'Victor', 'Joseph', 'Adam', 'Beach', 'Thomas', 'Builds-the-Fire', 'Evan', 'Adams', 'lives', 'became', 'entwined', 'when', 'babies', 'Victor', 'father', 'Arnold', 'Gary', 'Farmer', 'saved', 'Thomas', 'life', 'fire', 'consumed', 'parents', 'Arnold', 'abusive', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'was', 'traumatized', 'tragedy', 'family', 'eventually', 'dies', 'trailer', 'Arizona', 'desert', 'two', 'boys', 'who', 'have', 'grating', 'love-hate', 'relationship', 'travel', 'down', 'retrieve', 'remains', 'Victor', 'bottled', 'rage', 'set', 'smile', 'Thomas', 'tactless', 'Jiminy', 'Cricket', 'forcing', 'friend', 'face', 'currently', 'unbearable', 'reality', 'Meeting', 'Suzy', 'Song', 'Irene', 'Bedard', 'neighbor', 'surrogate', 'daughter', 'Arnold', 'circle', 'lives', 'completion', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Indian', 'movie', 'fable', 'such', 'universal', 'themes', 'family', 'betrayal', 'forgiveness', 'redemption', 'seen', 'Native', 'American', 'eyes', 'such', 'ethnic', 'barriers', 'What', 'Smoke', 'Signals', 'special', 'how', 'easily', 'several', 'levels', 'not', 'only', 'past', 'present', 'physical', 'ethereal', 'as', 'well', 'main', 'characters', 'seem', 'have', 'two', 'identities', 'are', 'constantly', 'shifting', 'frail', 'humanity', 'giving', 'way', 'deep', 'potent', 'spirit', 'particular', 'Evan', 'Adams', 'Thomas', 'nerdy', 'glasses', 'geek', 'manner', 'revealed', 'Old', 'Man', 'Coyote', 'storyteller', 'brazenly', 'outlandish', 'tales', 'carry', 'wisdom', 'power', 'ending', 'scene', 'nameless', 'Spokane', 'bridge', 'level', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'mainstream', 'movies', 'are', 'unable', 'unwilling', 'touch', 'first', 'film', 'ever', 'produced', 'directed', 'acted', 'Native', 'Americans', 'won', 'various', 'awards', '1998', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'poignant', 'soundtrack', 'native', 'acappella', 'group', 'Ulali', 'hilarious', 'chant', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Teeth', 'Adapted', 'story', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'Tonto', 'Fistfight', 'Heaven', 'Sherman', 'Alexie', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay']",Smoke Signals VHS
454501,APTF9UDVDUPGU,6305210101,"David McEldery ""TV Junkie""","[4, 4]","For a long time, Pow Wow Highway was my favorite Rez film, but Smoke Signals might squeeze that worthy effort into 2nd place. I don't really care for ""Dances With Wolves."" I see it as a film to make white people feel better about what was done to Indians in the past. I was also disappointed in ""Windtalkers."" I thought it would be about the men who fooled the Japanese by sending messages in Navajo, but no, it was about Nicholas Cage's nice white man, friend to the Windtalkers. I sure wish the movie had been an all-Indian production like Smoke Signals. Would have been a far better film.I read a lot of the Amazon reviews so as not to tread ground previously trod upon. I went first to the negative reviews, few in number, though they be. We each have our own tastes. This isn't a CGI film, not a lot of stunts, special effects, or car chases. Most of the action occurs in the heart. At least two of the reviewers say the acting is really bad. Where do they get that? I'm white, but grew up near reservations in Montana, have a variety of Indian friends (and as a kid, a few enemies), and have cousins from two tribes. I won't claim to be an expert. You really have to live in someone else's skin to truly understand what it's like, or walk a mile in their moccasins. I thought the acting was first rate. The conversations sounded like ones I've heard over dinner tables, around campfires, and in taverns. One reviewer said the actors spoke with Canadian accents. That's pretty funny, though the main characters happen to be Canadian. Sounded a lot like some Indians I know. Maybe Canadians speak with Indian accents? I've been with Indian friends who spoke better English than the local whites, but loved to do a little ""indian-speak"" in the presence of bleeding heart whites, or their racist kin, just to see them cringe, or put them off. I'm not a ""cuzz-in,"" I'm a ""cuss'n.""Anyway, the most unusual character in the film is Thomas. At first I wondered if Evan Adams was just a bad actor, or if his character was simple-minded. As the movie developed, his character unfolded. Thomas was part shaman, spirit guide, and in an odd way, a mentor. He is an innocent savant, naive, but not naive. His character is a device the writer chose to get some ideas across. I've known a lot of Victor types. They abound on the rez for good reason. Thomases are out there too, but they're not as obvious as the character in this movie.Back in the Clinton era, there was a big political correctness effort in government service. Federal employees were supposed to refer to Indians as Native Americans. I decided to exercise my new found sensitivity at a family reunion, and in a discussion with my cousins, I used the term Native American. The indians started laughing. When I asked why, they said, ""You can sure tell a government worker!"" When I asked them what they called themselves (this may sound odd, but I'd always just thought of them as people), and they said, ""'Indians,' Columbus screwed us up, but we've decided it's easier to just go with it, and it's one word, not a bunch of them,"" and laughed their rear-ends off. It was pretty funny, but you'd have to have been there. Years later, a young Indian friend came to visit during a college semester break. After high school, he spent 4 years in the US Army and had been in the Desert Storm invasion of Iraq. He was able to attend (and graduate) from college on the GI Bill, and was taking an elective in anthropology. He told me about how the professor kept referring to Indians as ""indigenous people."" That really got to my young friend. He asked me if I'd been born in Montana, and I said yes. He then asked, ""Doesn't that make you indigenous to Montana? Doesn't that mean everyone who's born in a place is indigenous to it?"" Well, yes, it does. He told that to the professor, and got no response, just an angry shake of the head. Many of my Indian friends and relatives have passed away, and I haven't been around reservation culture for quite a long time, though I only live a few miles away. The word ""indigenous"" was used in the movie several times, so now I'm curious about it. Who is indigenous? The term must have hit the rez during the 1990s, because I don't recall it being used in earlier decades. Yep, I'm out of touch.The song on the bus about John Wayne's teeth was hilarious. I won't be able to watch another John Wayne flick without looking at his teeth and hearing this song. The warrior face is something everyone who is ""different"" understands. It is a mask, protective gear. If you don't understand this, you're very white and have led a privileged life. It was pretty well explained in the movie, for us palefaces and maybe Indian boys who never thought about it, who are just conditioned to react. I once supervised a young, white, local boy on a large forest fire. He put on quite a macho swagger, always looked grim, had on the warrior face. Late one night we had a conversation about where our people came from. I explained that my family came from Scotland and Ireland. He gave me that puzzled look and asked, ""Are you really Irish? You don't seem Irish."" I asked what he meant. He said, ""Well I thought the Irish were tough. You don't act tough."" I told him the operative word was ""act."" Tough is being who you are, and not caring what anyone else thinks. I don't have a warrior face, and I don't put one on. I don't have to. I know who I am, and in deference to Victor, it's easier for me to blend in and not need one. A warrior face can keep your friends at bay, as well as your enemies. Yes, America is a foreign country to many Indians. It's hard to leave the reservation, no matter how talented you are, or how great your potential is. The Rez is where your friends and family are, where you're generally accepted for who you are. You're known there and don't have to explain yourself. No one stares at you. Leave the reservation and you're in a foreign land, even though you've seen it on TV, and come in contact with it through school sports and shopping trips. Living in this foreign land is not easy. Who do you go to when you're in trouble? Who do you talk to? Who understands? Who supports you? Who has your back? No one. It's a great problem that some universities are working to overcome, where Indian students are concerned. Most of white society is indifferent to the difficulty Indians have transitioning between the Rez and the outside world, and going to and from.There are some really delightful cameo appearances in the movie, including Cynthia Gearing as Cathy, the alternate Olympic gymnast, and Elaine Miles as Lucy, the contrarian, who drives backwards. No, palefaces, reverse isn't the only gear left in her ""pony."" It's sweet and funny. Contrarians puncture pretension, disrupt authority, and inject humor. Both of these wonderful ladies had major roles in the TV series, Northern Exposure. Elaine was Dr. Fleishman's acerbic and insightful receptionist, Marilyn. Tom Skerritt nicely plays an almost stereotypical Arizona sheriff, who stereotypes Indians. However, the movie didn't devolve into an additional stereotype, man's inhumanity to man, as I dreaded it would. Life is a mixed bag. Sometimes honesty (a white witness) prevails, and authority accepts it. Gary Farmer (of Pow Wow Highway fame), is one of my favorite, unsung actors. He played the alcoholic, conflicted father to a ""T"". Alcoholism in Montana is rampant, not only on reservations, but in white society too. I think we have the 4th highest DUI and death rate due to alcohol in the US. I speak with some authority, having been sober now for 10 years. I was always perplexed to hear white drunks in local taverns talk disparagingly about drunken Indians, like, go look in a mirror! Indians aren't the only ones who are conflicted over alcoholic fathers. Some critics didn't care for the dumping of the ashes near Spokane Falls at the end of the movie, but to my mind,  it was necessary. If you thought the ashes and song about fathers was over the top, the film isn't speaking to you. Sons sometimes never come to grips with love for fathers who vacillate between smothering and totally absent (if not overtly abusive), and don't analyze their feelings and experiences, only process emotionally. It's possible that this ending may have reached some sons who never thought about it, couldn't put this into words.If you like this film, or are encouraged to understand more about contemporary Indian life, I suggest reading McNichol's book, ""The Surrounded,"" and James Welch's works, ""Winter In The Blood,"" and ""The Death of Jim Loney."" The settings are in the 20th century, but will give you a gut level idea why some things are the way they are.",5,Who Is indigenous?,1277856000,"06 30, 2010",2010,8718,"['long', 'time', 'Pow', 'Wow',

I try to recall this movie whenever I run into someone I can not find redeemable. Sometimes you can only focus on the bad, and sometimes you only focus on the good, and sometimes you discover the middle.Victor Joseph and his friend Thomas are taking a road trip. Thomas and Victor are on their way to pay their last respects to Victor's dad who was living in Phoenix. Victor needs some financial assistance and Thomas is willing to help so long as he can go with. Victor needs to come to grips with his past, how he feels about his father who has passed away and he hasn't seen in 10 years, he needs to stop living with a mask on. Thomas seems terribly annoying, but it's Thomas recollections of everything good that help Victor see that not all is lost. Thomas' positive energy helps elevate the mood of the movie as well. Suzy Song is who the boys find when they get to Phoenix, and she fills in the gaps for Victor about his father.It is the journey of this movie that is beautiful.

The story is centered around Victor and Thomas.  Victor is handsome, athletic and a guy's guy.  Thomas is a short, geeky nerd and relishes in storytelling.  The boys are connected through Victor's Father, who saved Thomas from a fire that killed his parents.  Thomas considers Victor's Father a hero and tells worship-like stories about him.  He is optimistic, upbeat and a dreamer.  Conversely, Victor has to contend with his Father's alcoholism, beatings and verbal abuse - and is a sullen young man who is constantly brooding.  Victor and Thomas grow up together in the neighborhood - not a close friendship but one of a forced alliance.Eventually, Victor's Father leaves him and his Mother to parts unknown.  Victor learns that his Father dies and he is asked to pick up his Father's ashes and belongings.  Victor leans on Thomas to lend him the money to make the trip to Phoenix, however Thomas will only do so if Victor brings him along the trip.This is a quirky, funny film - similar to the awarded winning film, Juno.  You feel  the hatred, the love and the longing that Victor has for his Father. The relationship between Victor and the one-of-a-kind Thomas is similar to John Candy and Steve Martin in Planes, Trains and Automobiles.

Overall I really enjoyed it, but it was sort of obtuse.  I heartily enjoyed ""Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven"" and when I viewed Smoke Signals I thought ""Whoa!  They must have pried this from Sherman Alexie's hands and ran with it!  I'm surprised he didn't insist on having his name taken off it!""  I was surprised to find out that he co-produced it and wrote the screenplay!The acting could have been better, although I thought Thomas Builds-the-fire was very cute with his braids and big smile.  It bothered me that the characters in this movie were constantly expounding on the fact that they were Indian.  They brought it up every couple of minutes!  Somehow, I doubt that that is what real Indians do.  We know you're Indian, you don't have to state it.  ""What are you going to trade us?  Because we're Indian, remember?  We barter!""  I would think that most Indians don't see a lot of novelty in the fact that they are Indian and these characters certainly did.  This made it seem like the film was presenting ""Indians"" in third person rather than letting them be themselves.  It would have been improved if it had been a little more natural and less self-conscious.Over all, though, it's worth seeing despite its corniness for its powerful message and, of course, the cuteness of smiley Evan Adams.",3,"Good, but flawed",1174435200,"03 21, 2007",2007,1438,"['see', 'five-star', 'reviews', 'wonder', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'found', 'move', 'overwrought', 'little', 'bit', 'corny', 'Overall', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'sort', 'obtuse', 'heartily', 'enjoyed', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'Tonto', 'Fistfight', 'Heaven', 'when', 'viewed', 'Smoke', 'Signals', 'thought', 'Whoa', 'must', 'have', 'pried', 'Sherman', 'Alexie', 'hands', 'ran', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'insist', 'having', 'name', 'taken', 'off', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'out', 'co-produced', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'acting', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'thought', 'Thomas', 'Builds-the-fire', 'was', 'very', 'cute', 'braids', 'big', 'smile', 'bothered', 'characters', 'movie', 'were', 'constantly', 'expounding', 'fact', 'were', 'Indian', 'brought', 'up', 'couple', 'minutes', 'Somehow', 'doubt', 'what', 'real', 'Indians', 'do', 'know', ""'re"", 'Indian', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'state', 'What', 'are', 'going', 'trade', ""'re"", 'Indian', 'remember', 'barter', 'would', 'think', 'most', 'Indians', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'lot', 'novelty', 'fact', 'are', 'Indian', 'characters', 'certainly', 'did', 'made', 'seem', 'film', 'was', 'presenting', 'Indians', 'third', 'person', 'rather', 'letting', 'be', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'had', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'natural', 'less', 'self-conscious.Over', 'worth', 'seeing', 'corniness', 'powerful', 'message', 'course', 'cuteness', 'smiley', 'Evan', 'Adams']",Smoke Signals VHS
454505,ADS5APY1NKTL4,6305210101,"D. Pawl ""Dani""","[23, 23]","I want to start out by saying Sherman Alexie is probably one of the greatest writers of our time.  When I say &quot;greatest writers&quot; I don't mean &quot;greatest NATIVE writers&quot; or &quot;greatest writers of COLOR,&quot; I mean Greatest Writers.  Mr. Alexie manages to capture the most universal emotions (grief, joy, heartbreak, anguish) and make the excessible to all, yet he also brings his own unique flavor, style and ironic wit to the mix so we are never bored.  I can honestly say that Smoke Signals is one of those films that is really dear to my heart for many reasons, and the screenplay by Alexie definitely is one of the contributing factors.For starters, there are so many classic lines in this film.  The first being that line I used as the subject for this review.  &quot;It is a good day to be Indigenous.&quot;  I don't think we hear that everyday!  The negative view of native people even today is really disturbing, and I think when people regardless of background see the portrayal of indigenous people in films, television shows, literature and education it continues to horrify and astound us all.Secondly, the story is a wonderful and important one that I think everyone can relate to.  It touches on the theme of fathers and the relationship with their children.  Victor (Adam Beach) is an bitter, angry and distrustful young man who grew up on the Coeur D'Alene &quot;Rez&quot; with his bespectacled friend/nemesis Thomas Builds-the-Fire (Evan Adams). These young men are growing up in a culture separate from mainstream white culture--a culture they eventually leave when they go to retrieve the ashes of Victor's deceased father.  What starts out as a road trip turns into something more significant than either of them could've imagined.  It becomes ceremonial, and a real opportunity for maturity that changes their relationships with each other and themselves.Finally, the acting is wonderful.  The lead actors are engaging, believable and sympathetic.  The supporting cast is strong and they really capture the essence of Alexie's novels.  When I read TONTO AND LONE RANGER FISTFIGHT IN HEAVEN (specifically the short story, &quot;This is What It Means to Say Phoenix, Arizona,&quot; which the film was based on), the way I envisioned the characters (how they would look, how they would talk, etc) matched the image exactly!Take it from me, a Sherman Alexie fan and self-proclaimed &quot;culture vulture&quot;.....this film is all that and a stack of fry bread!",5,It's a Good Day to Be Indigenous....,1086393600,"06 5, 2004",2004,2501,"['want', 'start', 'out', 'saying', 'Sherman', 'Alexie', 'probably', 'one', 'greatest', 'writers', 'time', 'When', 'say', 'quot', 'greatest', 'writers', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'quot', 'greatest', 'NATIVE', 'writers', 'quot', 'quot', 'greatest', 'writers', 'COLOR', 'quot', 'mean', 'Greatest', 'Writers', 'Mr.', 'Alexie', 'capture', 'most', 'universal', 'emotions', 'grief', 'joy', 'heartbreak', 'anguish', 'make', 'excessible', 'also', 'own', 'unique', 'flavor', 'style', 'ironic', 'wit', 'mix', 'are', 'never', 'bored', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'Smoke', 'Signals', 'one', 'films', 'really', 'dear', 'heart', 'many', 'reasons', 'screenplay', 'Alexie', 'definitely', 'one', 'contributing', 'factors.For', 'starters', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'classic', 'lines', 'film', 'first', 'being', 'line', 'used', 'subject', 'review', 'quot', 'good', 'day', 'be', 'Indigenous.', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'hear', 'everyday', 'negative', 'view', 'native', 'people', 'even', 'today', 'really', 'disturbing', 'think', 'when', 'people', 'regardless', 'background', 'see', 'portrayal', 'indigenous', 'people', 'films', 'television', 'shows', 'literature', 'education', 'horrify', 'astound', 'all.Secondly', 'story', 'wonderful', 'important', 'one', 'think', 'everyone', 'can', 'relate', 'theme', 'fathers', 'relationship', 'children', 'Victor', 'Adam', 'Beach', 'bitter', 'angry', 'distrustful', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'Coeur', ""D'Alene"", 'quot', 'Rez', 'quot', 'bespectacled', 'friend/nemesis', 'Thomas', 'Builds-the-Fire', 'Evan', 'Adams', 'young', 'men', 'are', 'growing', 'up', 'culture', 'separate', 'mainstream', 'white', 'culture', 'culture', 'eventually', 'leave', 'when', 'go', 'retrieve', 'ashes', 'Victor', 'deceased', 'father', 'What', 'out', 'road', 'trip', 'something', 'more', 'significant', 'could', ""'ve"", 'imagined', 'ceremonial', 'real', 'opportunity', 'maturity', 'relationships', 'other', 'themselves.Finally', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'lead', 'actors', 'are', 'engaging', 'believable', 'sympathetic', 'supporting', 'cast', 'strong', 'really', 'capture', 'essence', 'Alexie', 'novels', 'When', 'read', 'TONTO', 'AND', 'LONE', 'RANGER', 'FISTFIGHT', 'IN', 'HEAVEN', 'specifically', 'short', 'story', 'quot', 'What', 'Say', 'Phoenix', 'Arizona', 'quot', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'way', 'envisioned', 'characters', 'how', 'would', 'look', 'how', 'would', 'talk', 'etc', 'matched', 'image', 'exactly', 'Take', 'Sherman', 'Alexie', 'fan', 'self-proclaimed', 'quot', 'culture', 'vulture', 'quot', '..this', 'film', 'stack', 'fry', 'bread']",Smoke Signals VHS

454508,AT6CZDCP4TRGA,6305210101,Eduarrdo Nietzsche,"[2, 7]","This film is to be commended for giving viewers a look at the culture and experience of native American people, without the usual Hollywood sentimentalization and stereotyping.  The plot is passable, it's a archetypal father-son wounding-conflict-forgiveness story that would be great to show at a Mankind Project Integration-Group gathering.  Even though this is a small-budget indie movie that was much celebrated at Sundance, it still has its share of storytelling cliches.The fatal flaw is that Adam Beach, who plays the main protagonist, is mediocre at best---his acting is as flat as the poor camera work and flaccid film editing.  He is hopelessly not up to the material, especially in the scenes where he's supposed to be breaking out of his stoic persona and having some emotional outbursts.  Evan Adams plays opposite him as the ""wise fool"" sidekick who speaks English with a weird Irish-sounding accent that is supposed to pass for native American, he might have been more engaging with a better director behind the camera.  Gary Farmer phones in his role as the lumbering, rough-but-really-not-that-bad-a-guy alcoholic father.The film finally lights up when the drop-dead gorgeous Irene Bedard comes onscreen, but unfortunately her character is never developed at all---the film quickly shifts back into male-bonding road-movie mode.  Tantoo Cardinal and Monique Mojica are the two other more talented cast members but like Bedard, are given far too little screen time.Overall, I felt like I was watching a 1970s era made-for-TV production, perhaps an ""Afterschool Special"" or Disney movie.  There is zero narrative tension or momentum, it just kind of slackly meanders along.

I wanted to watch it again before reviewing and just never got around to it - nor do I own it on DVD yet. Amazing, since it is an all-time favorite, a unique classic and a one-of-a-kind movie. It made one hell of an impact when it first came out, and everyone I knew was talking about it. It was the first film in history to be written (by Sherman Alexie and based on the novelThe Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven), co-produced (Alexie) and directed by a Native.Adam Beach (Cowboys & Aliens,Older Than America, see my reviews,Flags of Our Fathers (Widescreen Edition),Windtalkers) stars as Victor Joseph, a passive-aggressive young Indian of the Coeur d'Alene Tribe from Plummer, Idaho. With him throughout life is his childhood friend, the weirdly autistic, gentle, ethereal Evan Adams as Thomas Builds-the-Fire. While Victor lives with his mother Arlene (the immortal Tantoo Cardinal), Thomas lives nearby with his grandmother (Monique Mojica (I suspect she is related to my grandmother's family), credited as ""Grandma Builds-the-Fire""). That other great, Gary Farmer stars as Arnold Joseph, Victor's estranged father.This is a modern fairy tale, a spiritual journey, a poem and a profound drama. While the cast happens to be Native, this is about family, love, honor and shame, guilt and penitence. Victor's father accidentally sets fire to the home of the Builds-the-Fire Family, killing Thomas' parents but at the same time he manages to save Thomas. In a bit of excessive merry-making and drunk, Arnold Joseph believes it is his son Victor - not Thomas - that he's saving. When Victor and Thomas are 12, Arnold leaves them, bound for Phoenix.Years later, the Josephs receive a call that Arnold has passed away - and Victor determines that he will travel to Phoenix to see about his father's effects. Naturally Thomas the storyteller wants to go with Victor. It seems these two characters are more than brothers, and as Thomas whimsically narrates, ""Some children are not children at all, but are of fire and burn everything they touch. Some are of ash and fall apart if you touch them. I was born of fire; and Victor was born of ash."" These are profound words, yet the film is generally praised as a comedy.Certainly there are laugh-out-loud moments, such as Victor and Thomas annoying everyone on the bus ride by chanting, Native-style, ""John Wayne's Teeth"": ""Are they false? Are they real? Are they plastic, are they steel?"" We are also treated to Arnold, in a flashback-within-a-flashback telling the fall-down funny story about how he and Victor played basketball against a team of Jesuit priests. Absolutely hilarious. But there are profound moments too: They make friends with Arnold's girlfriend Suzy Song (the beautiful Irene Bedard) who challenges Victor to face his grief over his father. Later, Victor crashes his father's truck while arguing violently with Thomas and finds himself in a tragic, sad situation.There are surprises and deep, deep emotions in this film. It is not an ""Indian"" film, it is a film for the ages. Do not let the goofy presence of Lester Fallsapart (Chief Leonard George, son of Chief Dan GeorgeThe Best of Chief Dan George) put you off (Lester has been broken down on the highway since the 1970s, and has a permanent traffic-watching post from where he reports to the reservation radio station).This gorgeous film was shot on location in and all around Plummer, Idaho, and in Washington State. With the additional beautiful talents of Tom Skerritt (a wonderful cameo as a sympathetic sheriff), Cody Lightning, Simon Baker, John Trudell, Michael Greyeyes, Darwin Haine (all stunningly handsome fellows today), the wonderful Elaine Miles and an equally lovely and hilarious Cynthia Geary (Tell Me No Secrets/When Time Expires).The only thing I can decry about this is it didn't really kick off the Indian film revolution we all expected. As lauded and classic as this film deservedly is, nothing much ever came of it.Note that the only goof in this film that matters is federal law would prohibit the same bus driver to drive from Idaho to Arizona, as it occurred in the film.",5,"Where there is smoke, there is a spiritual fire",1336176000,"05 5, 2012",2012,4233,"['SMOKE', 'SIGNALS', 'dir', 'Chris', 'Eyre', '1998', '88', 'minutes', 'fantastic', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'years', 'review', 'wanted', 'watch', 'again', 'reviewing', 'just', 'never', 'got', 'do', 'own', 'DVD', 'yet', 'Amazing', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'unique', 'classic', 'one-of-a-kind', 'movie', 'made', 'one', 'hell', 'impact', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'everyone', 'knew', 'was', 'talking', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'history', 'be', 'written', 'Sherman', 'Alexie', 'based', 'novelThe', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'Tonto', 'Fistfight', 'Heaven', 'co-produced', 'Alexie', 'directed', 'Native.Adam', 'Beach', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'Older', 'Than', 'America', 'see', 'reviews', 'Flags', 'Fathers', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'Windtalkers', 'Victor', 'Joseph', 'passive-aggressive', 'young', 'Indian', 'Coeur', ""d'Alene"", 'Tribe', 'Plummer', 'Idaho', 'life', 'childhood', 'friend', 'weirdly', 'autistic', 'gentle', 'ethereal', 'Evan', 'Adams', 'Thomas', 'Builds-the-Fire', 'Victor', 'mother', 'Arlene', 'immortal', 'Tantoo', 'Cardinal', 'Thomas', 'nearby', 'grandmother', 'Monique', 'Mojica', 'suspect', 'related', 'grandmother', 'family', 'credited', 'Grandma', 'Builds-the-Fire', 'other', 'great', 'Gary', 'Farmer', 'stars', 'Arnold', 'Joseph', 'Victor', 'estranged', 'father.This', 'modern', 'fairy', 'tale', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'poem', 'profound', 'drama', 'cast', 'be', 'Native', 'family', 'love', 'honor', 'shame', 'guilt', 'penitence', 'Victor', 'father', 'accidentally', 'fire', 'home', 'Builds-the-Fire', 'Family', 'killing', 'Thomas', 'parents', 'same', 'time', 'save', 'Thomas', 'bit', 'excessive', 'merry-making', 'drunk', 'Arnold', 'Joseph', 'son', 'Victor', 'not', 'Thomas', 'saving', 'When', 'Victor', 'Thomas', 'are', '12', 'Arnold', 'bound', 'Phoenix.Years', 'later', 'Josephs', 'receive', 'call', 'Arnold', 'passed', 'away', 'Victor', 'determines', 'will', 'travel', 'Phoenix', 'see', 'father', 'effects', 'Naturally', 'Thomas', 'storyteller', 'go', 'Victor', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'brothers', 'Thomas', 'whimsically', 'children', 'are', 'not', 'children', 'are', 'fire', 'burn', 'everything', 'touch', 'are', 'ash', 'fall', 'apart', 'touch', 'was', 'born', 'fire', 'Victor', 'was', 'born', 'ash', 'are', 'profound', 'words', 'yet', 'film', 'generally', 'praised', 'comedy.Certainly', 'are', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'such', 'Victor', 'Thomas', 'annoying', 'everyone', 'bus', 'ride', 'chanting', 'Native-style', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Teeth', 'Are', 'false', 'Are', 'real', 'Are', 'plastic', 'are', 'steel', 'are', 'also', 'treated', 'Arnold', 'flashback-within-a-flashback', 'telling', 'fall-down', 'funny', 'story', 'how', 'Victor', 'played', 'basketball', 'team', 'Jesuit', 'priests', 'Absolutely', 'hilarious', 'are', 'profound', 'moments', 'too', 'make', 'friends', 'Arnold', 'girlfriend', 'Suzy', 'Song', 'beautiful', 'Irene', 'Bedard', 'who', 'Victor', 'face', 'grief', 'father', 'Later', 'Victor', 'father', 'truck', 'arguing', 'violently', 'Thomas', 'tragic', 'sad', 'are', 'surprises', 'deep', 'deep', 'emotions', 'film', 'not', 'Indian', 'film', 'film', 'ages', 'Do', 'not', 'let', 'goofy', 'presence', 'Lester', 'Fallsapart', 'Chief', 'Leonard', 'George', 'son', 'Chief', 'Dan', 'GeorgeThe', 'Best', 'Chief', 'Dan', 'George', 'put', 'off', 'Lester', 'been', 'broken', 'down', 'highway', '1970s', 'permanent', 'traffic-watching', 'post', 'where', 'reservation', 'radio', 'station', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'around', 'Plummer', 'Idaho', 'Washington', 'State', 'additional', 'beautiful', 'talents', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'wonderful', 'cameo', 'sympathetic', 'sheriff', 'Cody', 'Lightning', 'Simon', 'Baker', 'John', 'Trudell', 'Michael', 'Greyeyes', 'Darwin', 'Haine', 'stunningly', 'handsome', 'fellows', 'today', 'wonderful', 'Elaine', 'Miles', 'equally', 'lovely', 'hilarious', 'Cynthia', 'Geary', 'Tell', 'Me', 'No', 'Secrets/When', 'Time', 'Expires', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'decry', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'kick', 'off', 'Indian', 'film', 'revolution', 'expected', 'lauded', 'classic', 'film', 'deservedly', 'nothing', 'much', 'ever', 'came', 'it.Note', 'only', 'goof', 'film', 'matters', 'federal', 'law', 'would', 'prohibit', 'same', 'bus', 'driver', 'drive', 'Idaho', 'Arizona', 'occurred', 'film']",Smoke Signals VHS

You really think you won&#65533;t encounter THE ONE ACTOR who almost literally shows up everywhere. You would, though, be wrong. You watch the film, some scenes shown in flashback sequence, seeing how one of the characters has been abandoned by his alcoholic father, how depressing the life on the reservation can be, and how society on an Indian reservation functions from the point of view of the writer. The father has apparently never been the same since he saved the second boy from a fire which consumed the second boy&#65533;s parents, and his drinking got out of control. You see the other boy portrayed as the stereotypical Indian who tells long stories, wears long braids and rhapsodises about eating the best fry bread in the world. These two boys grow up as friends reluctantly. When the first boy receives word that his long absent father has died somewhere in Arizona, he knows he must go there to retrieve the father&#65533;s belongings, but he nor his mother have the money to get there. So of course, the second boy offers to take the first boy if he will take him along. So they use the second boy&#65533;s money to take a bus from their home in Idaho/Eastern Washington to Arizona. Along the way they argue often (quite interesting scenes) and meet a few interesting characters. When they get to Arizona they meet the father&#65533;s neighbour woman and the boy sorts through the father&#65533;s things. The two boys set out to come home again in the father&#65533;s old truck, and they encounter trouble with a drunk driver along the way and end up being questioned by the police. AND WHO DO YOU THINK THAT POLICE MAN IS? The ubiquitous Tom Skerritt! NO! Wouldn&#65533;t you think that Tom Skerritt, who seems to show up everywhere, would never show up here? I would have thought that. But no film is safe from the influence of Tom Skerritt, apparently.Nevertheless, despite the Tom Skerritt appearance, the film is quite a telling picture, very understated.

Some reviews led me to think it was an indie comedy, with a road trip thrown in (isn't that the indie way?).  I didn't find much to laugh at in this film; I watched it on a bleak, rainy Saturday afternoon and felt even bleaker afterwards.We talked about stereotypes in class and this film does nothing to contradict those stereotypes.  Alcoholism, hopelessness, and despair are the order of the day, as we watch Victor's father hit him, set a house on fire (because he was drunk), kill two people, and ultimately desert his family because he can't promise Victor's mother that he'll stop drinking.  He leaves their impoverished reservation only to end up on another one, and meets an attractive young woman with some not-so-savory secrets in her own past.  She is a sympathetic character, however, and they become friends; it is she who calls Victor's mother with the news that her husband has died.  Victor and his childhood friend (a lopsided friendship, to be sure, because it all comes from Thomas' side) Thomas decide to go retrieve Victor's father's ashes.  Thomas, of course, provides the money for this trip, and endures Victor's insults and criticism for the duration of the trip.Victor can't forgive his father, of course, and carries almost equal amounts of rage and love churning up within him.  Thomas, who is a quirky, saintlike character, finally tells him off and tells him what to do to find some peace.  In the meantime, events occur which make you wonder if Victor will ever get a break.The ending is ambiguous and left me wondering if Victor was finally going to be able to put his past to rest and get on with his life, or if he would ultimately end up just like his father.

Chris Eyre's Sundance busting, feature-film debut is the first film written, produced, and shot entirely by Native Americans, and also shares the distinction of being Native American (or Indian, as he prefers to be called) writer Sherman Alexie's first big-screen conversion of his brilliant prose.  The second, Alexie-directed ""The Business of Fancydancing,"" is currently playing the festival circuit, but ""Smoke Signals"" remains more of a family-oriented, character-driven film and one that will become both a cult and film-school classic.The movie follows two young men, Victor and Thomas, as they set off on a road trip to pick up Victor's father's things.  Victor's father was an abusive drunk, and left when Victor was young.  Victor grew up to be a bit of an egotistical, surly brat (although not nearly as much as he was in the books), and only takes the nerdy, storytelling Thomas with him because otherwise could not afford the trip.  Along the way, the two discover a little about themselves as Indians, and their place in American society as well as in their own families.  Not exactly an action movie, but the brilliant acting, great scriptwriting (you just KNOW that most of this came from Alexie's real-life experiences) and simple heart of the film carry it through some potentially dull and clich&eacute; moments.Miramax's DVD presentation simply doesn't do the film justice.  There's a crisp, but fairly un-dynamic Dolby Digital 5.1 track, but the film is presented in letterboxed widescreen instead of anamorphic.  The print is clean and clear, but it's gonna look crummy on high-end home theaters no matter how you shake it.  There are no extras to speak of, either, which is a shame since of all the movies released with boatloads of extra features (Rush Hour 2, for example), a film like this, of interest to people and filmmakers alike, NEEDS those sorts of features.I first saw this movie in Tulsa with an Indian friend from high school.  We had the theatre to ourselves, and laughed and cried throughout.  Smoke Signals is worth checking out, and if you enjoy it, use it as a gateway to educate yourself about Indians and Indian literature.  This DVD, while minimal, looks to be the best version we're going to see for quite a while (Miramax hasn't even gotten around to re-releasing Pulp Fiction yet, or Swingers, let alone Smoke Signals).  It's priced nice, too.  If you have doubts, rent it, but do yourself a favor and see it one way or another.Grades:Movie: A-DVD: C",4,Movie - 5 Stars - DVD - 3 and a half stars,1021939200,"05 21, 2002",2002,2540,"['Ah', 'yes', 'great', 'day', 'be', 'indigenous', 'Chris', 'Eyre', 'Sundance', 'busting', 'feature-film', 'debut', 'first', 'film', 'written', 'produced', 'shot', 'entirely', 'Native', 'Americans', 'also', 'shares', 'distinction', 'being', 'Native', 'American', 'Indian', 'be', 'called', 'writer', 'Sherman', 'Alexie', 'first', 'big-screen', 'conversion', 'brilliant', 'prose', 'second', 'Alexie-directed', 'Business', 'Fancydancing', 'currently', 'playing', 'festival', 'circuit', 'Smoke', 'Signals', 'more', 'family-oriented', 'character-driven', 'film', 'one', 'will', 'become', 'cult', 'film-school', 'classic.The', 'movie', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'Victor', 'Thomas', 'set', 'off', 'road', 'trip', 'pick', 'up', 'Victor', 'father', 'things', 'Victor', 'father', 'was', 'abusive', 'drunk', 'left', 'when', 'Victor', 'was', 'young', 'Victor', 'grew', 'up', 'be', 'bit', 'egotistical', 'surly', 'brat', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'books', 'only', 'nerdy', 'storytelling', 'Thomas', 'otherwise', 'could', 'not', 'afford', 'trip', 'way', 'two', 'discover', 'little', 'about', 'Indians', 'place', 'American', 'society', 'as', 'well', 'own', 'families', 'Not', 'exactly', 'action', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'great', 'scriptwriting', 'just', 'KNOW', 'most', 'came', 'Alexie', 'real-life', 'experiences', 'simple', 'heart', 'film', 'carry', 'potentially', 'dull', 'clich', 'eacute', 'moments.Miramax', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'simply', ""n't"", 'do', 'film', 'justice', 'crisp', 'fairly', 'un-dynamic', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'track', 'film', 'presented', 'letterboxed', 'widescreen', 'instead', 'anamorphic', 'print', 'clean', 'clear', 'gon', 'look', 'crummy', 'high-end', 'home', 'theaters', 'matter', 'how', 'shake', 'are', 'extras', 'speak', 'shame', 'movies', 'released', 'boatloads', 'extra', 'features', 'Rush', 'Hour', '2', 'example', 'film', 'interest', 'people', 'filmmakers', 'alike', 'NEEDS', 'sorts', 'features.I', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'Tulsa', 'Indian', 'friend', 'high', 'school', 'had', 'theatre', 'ourselves', 'laughed', 'cried', 'Smoke', 'Signals', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'enjoy', 'use', 'gateway', 'educate', 'Indians', 'Indian', 'literature', 'DVD', 'minimal', 'be', 'best', 'version', ""'re"", 'going', 'see', 'quite', 'while', 'Miramax', ""n't"", 'even', 'gotten', 'around', 're-releasing', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'yet', 'Swingers', 'let', 'alone', 'Smoke', 'Signals', 'priced', 'nice', 'too', 'have', 'doubts', 'rent', 'do', 'favor', 'see', 'one', 'way', 'another.Grades', 'Movie', 'A-DVD', 'C']",Smoke Signals VHS
454522,A32EVG7Y33H4RJ,6305210101,JazzFeathers,"[0, 0]","""Smoke Signals"" is based on the collection of stories by Sherman Alexie ""Lone-Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven"". The structure of the film owns it to the story ""What It Means to Say Phoenix, Arizona"" but a lot of other ideas and episodes come from different stories in the same collection.At heart, this is a father-to-son story, but with many culturally meaningful implications. There is a very strong Native American feeling to everything in the story.I actually liked the beginning of the film, happening in the reservation, the best. To me, here it was the strongest of Alexie's outlook on life and way to interpret reality, his so very personal way to turn reality into something surreal and for this more poignant. I do like a lot the rest of the film as well, but this first part is, in my opinion, the more personal and original.I enjoyed the ride on the bus a lot. That's probably the funniest part, with jokes, but also metaphors, all over the place.The last part is maybe the less original. I mean, for a big part it falls into the kind of father-to-son story that I've seen before. A son trying to make sense of his father's life, trying to pin down how he's different from his father and how he's the same as his father and what part of this is good and what part is bad.Here's where the journey of the main character, Victor, really lies. Here is where he changes his view of life in the end.I did enjoy the film, but because I also read the story I couldn't help but make comparisons, and in a way I like the story best. While the film is definitely about Victor and his relation (I should say, changing relation) with his death father, the story is more about Victor and his relation with himself, as a man, but also (maybe even especially) as an American Indian. The different role played by Thomas Build-the-Fire inside the story tells it all. While in the film Thomas is Victor's travelling companion, the one who knew Victor's father and thought of him better than Victor ever did, in the story Thomas is the keeper of memory, he's the one who unearths forgotten memories and can make sense of them. In the film he's not the one who can make Victor see the truth. This role is Suzie's, who knew Victor's father in a different way from anyone else.It's a very subtle difference, but still one that changes the core and the balance of the story.All the actors are amazing, they just bring you into the story, but I especially loved Evan Adams. He has that same quality, which is also Alexie's, to turn reality into surreality and back, and delivered it to you in a richer way. I'm so sorry his character (Thomas) was scaled down from the story to the film, because he's certainly perfect for Thomas. The one who can see through reality, who can see beyond reality.I love it.",5,"Hey, Victor!",1348099200,"09 20, 2012",2012,2796,"['Smoke', 'Signals', 'based', 'collection', 'stories', 'Sherman', 'Alexie', 'Lone-Ranger', 'Tonto', 'Fistfight', 'Heaven', 'structure', 'film', 'story', 'What', 'Say', 'Phoenix', 'Arizona', 'lot', 'other', 'ideas', 'episodes', 'come', 'different', 'stories', 'same', 'collection.At', 'heart', 'father-to-son', 'story', 'many', 'culturally', 'meaningful', 'implications', 'very', 'strong', 'Native', 'American', 'feeling', 'everything', 'story.I', 'actually', 'liked', 'beginning', 'film', 'happening', 'reservation', 'best', 'here', 'was', 'strongest', 'Alexie', 'outlook', 'life', 'way', 'interpret', 'reality', 'so', 'very', 'personal', 'way', 'turn', 'reality', 'something', 'surreal', 'more', 'poignant', 'do', 'lot', 'rest', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'first', 'part', 'opinion', 'more', 'personal', 'original.I', 'enjoyed', 'ride', 'bus', 'lot', 'probably', 'funniest', 'part', 'jokes', 'also', 'metaphors', 'place.The', 'last', 'part', 'maybe', 'less', 'original', 'mean', 'big', 'part', 'kind', 'father-to-son', 'story', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'son', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'father', 'life', 'trying', 'pin', 'down', 'how', 'different', 'father', 'how', 'same', 'father', 'what', 'part', 'good', 'what', 'part', 'bad.Here', 'where', 'journey', 'main', 'character', 'Victor', 'really', 'Here', 'where', 'view', 'life', 'end.I', 'did', 'enjoy', 'film', 'also', 'read', 'story', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'make', 'comparisons', 'way', 'like', 'story', 'best', 'film', 'definitely', 'Victor', 'relation', 'should', 'say', 'changing', 'relation', 'death', 'father', 'story', 'more', 'Victor', 'relation', 'man', 'also', 'maybe', 'even', 'especially', 'American', 'Indian', 'different', 'role', 'played', 'Thomas', 'Build-the-Fire', 'story', 'film', 'Thomas', 'Victor', 'travelling', 'companion', 'one', 'who', 'knew', 'Victor', 'father', 'thought', 'better', 'Victor', 'ever', 'did', 'story', 'Thomas', 'keeper', 'memory', 'one', 'who', 'forgotten', 'memories', 'can', 'make', 'sense', 'film', 'not', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'Victor', 'see', 'truth', 'role', 'Suzie', 'who', 'knew', 'Victor', 'father', 'different', 'way', 'anyone', 'else.It', 'very', 'subtle', 'difference', 'still', 'one', 'core', 'balance', 'story.All', 'actors', 'are', 'amazing', 'just', 'bring', 'story', 'especially', 'loved', 'Evan', 'Adams', 'same', 'quality', 'also', 'Alexie', 'turn', 'reality', 'surreality', 'back', 'delivered', 'richer', 'way', ""'m"", 'so', 'sorry', 'character', 'Thomas', 'was', 'scaled', 'down', 'story', 'film', 'certainly', 'perfect', 'Thomas', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'reality', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'reality.I', 'love']",Smoke Signals VHS
454523,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,6305210101,Jeffrey Leach,"[5, 6]","Shortly after receiving my driver's license I decided to take a road trip through Nebraska. At one point in my journey I suddenly noticed Indians everywhere--driving down the road, sitting in parking lots off the state highway, and standing in front of decrepit looking buildings. ""What's going on here?"" I said to myself, not knowing at the time that I was cruising through the Winnebago reservation in Northern Nebraska. I always tell this story to friends nowadays, especially ones who champion Native American rights, and it never fails to get a laugh. Why? Because they know most of us rarely encounter Indians, let alone spend any time on reservations. Out here in the Midwest, you will still meet Native Americans from time to time outside of reservations. If you live on the East or West Coast of the United States, however, you probably have little interaction with Indians. Oh, you might have seen one on a college campus, or know someone who knows someone who has some ""Indian blood"" flowing through their veins, but most Americans have only seen Indians in old photographs or on television. In short, most of us have little idea about the lives of modern day Native Americans.Director Chris Eyre's three films, ""Skins,"" ""Skinwalkers,"" and ""Smoke Signals,"" put Indian characters center stage. ""Smoke Signals"" is the story of Victor Joseph (Adam Beach) and Thomas Builds the Fire (Evan Adams), two young men living on a reservation in Idaho. Years before the events we see in the film, Victor's father Arnold (Gary Farmer) rescued Thomas from a house fire that claimed the lives of his parents. The deed assumed, rightfully so, legendary dimensions on the reservation, and no one promotes this magnificent act more than Thomas Builds the Fire. A geeky, frequently poetic soul prone to rambling statements of epic sweep in a voice that could melt eardrums, Thomas annoys Victor to no end. It isn't the tone of Thomas voice or even his penchant for storytelling that works on Victor's last nerve, but the lionization of his father Arnold. A few years after the rescue, Arnold ran out on his son and wife and headed to Arizona. That he never returned angers Victor to end, almost as much as his recollections of Arnold's abusive behavior and chronic alcoholism. Thomas never saw any of this behavior, so his recollections revolve around the rescue and the day Arnold took the boy out to breakfast at a restaurant. These two differing perspectives of the same man form the crux of ""Smoke Signals.""One day Victor learns that his father has passed away and that he must go to Arizona to collect the man's ashes. Unfortunately for him, he can only afford to make the journey when Thomas offers to pay for the bus trip. Of course, Thomas insists on going along. What follows are a series of adventures, some amusing and some serious, as the two young men draw closer and closer to fulfilling their task. In a hilarious scene on the bus, Victor instructs Thomas on how to act like a real Indian (quit grinning like an idiot, adopt a serious mien) and gets into an argument with a passenger claiming to be a former Olympic gymnast. Victor Joseph doesn't appear to suffer fools kindly, and he often takes his anger about his life out on complete strangers, something that completely mystifies his friend Thomas. Victor's bad attitude continues once the two reach Arnold's trailer out in the desert. It appears that Arnold Joseph took up with Suzy Song (Irene Bedard), a beautiful young woman who also has many positive memories of the man. At first, Victor can barely stand listening to Suzy and Thomas exchanging these happy tales, but he eventually begins to understand that his father had a side he never knew about.I've seen all three Chris Eyre films, and I have to say that ""Smoke Signals"" is the most ""Indian"" of the three in that the answers to the story aren't offered to the audience on a silver platter. A person watching this film must actually think about what is happening onscreen or they won't get anything out of it. You might laugh a few times, about the aforementioned ""act like an Indian"" scene or the amusing KREZ traffic reporter sitting on the top of a broken down van at the side of an abandoned road, but you won't pick up on any of the emotional and psychological themes. I took the movie as an examination of how any one individual embodies both good and bad traits, and that these traits inspire different responses in different people. No one recollection of a person defines who that person is in their sum total, and only by learning different perspectives about someone can we even begin to approach the truth about that individual's real identity. Of course, I could be completely wrong. The good thing about ""Smoke Signals"" is that you can take away multiple meanings from the film and still enjoy the performances, the humor, and the drama.Another great element, found in all of Chris Eyre's films, is his refusal to play the often tiresome political correctness card. His movies always contain a few references to indignities Indians suffer and continue to suffer in this country, but he always relegates such comments to just one aspect of their existence. The director's concerns rest more on presenting his characters as real people dealing with universal human problems than worrying about who broke what treaty back in the nineteenth century. Chris Eyre is a magnificent director who could probably lens a film in any genre with any cast and do a wonderful job. I hope he keeps working in the future.",5,Another winner from Eyre,1104969600,"01 6, 2005",2005,5540,"['Shortly', 'receiving', 'driver', 'license', 'decided', 'take', 'road', 'trip', 'Nebraska',

454526,A2Q0ERQ25AQQNG,6305210101,Jonas Cukierman,"[2, 2]","One of the few, and well overdue films created and helmed by Native Americans, it is a simple story about ordinary people with extraordinary strength.Upon finding out about the death of his estranged and  alcoholic father, Victor (Adam Beach), a serious and angry youth, ventures  to retrieve his father's ashes from a craggy and desolate hideaway the  Arizona desert. Alongside Victor is his friend and companion, Thomas (Adam  Evans), a quirky and intellectual storyteller-type, who lost both parents  in a fire twenty years before.  The journey takes place on a bus and it is  here that Thomas and Victor find out just how different they are. Victor is  always stone-faced and reserved; Thomas is the humor and wit that keeps the  voyage going even in its darkest moments. One of the unique things about  this situation is that Thomas seems to have known Victor's father better  than Victor himself. As the roadtrip progresses, Thomas delivers  uncomplicated but emotionally charged accounts of how his relationship with  Victor's father manifested itself when he was a boy. And the reasons why  the man Thomas knew as his surrogate parent suddenly left one day never to  be heard from again.Thomas' mixture of distressing story threads,  interwoven with vignettes of whimsical humor paints a vivid picture for the  boy whose father disappeared in 1976. And for the first time, Victor is  able to drop his inhibited roughness, and earnestly respect his father for  what he was, and forgive him for the unanticipated departure.This film  not only touches on the delicateness of family complexities, But it also  provides an insight into the oral tradition of Native American  storytelling.",5,A rare and overdue gem.,959040000,"05 23, 2000",2000,1691,"['One', 'few', 'well', 'overdue', 'films', 'created', 'helmed', 'Native', 'Americans', 'simple', 'story', 'ordinary', 'people', 'extraordinary', 'strength.Upon', 'finding', 'out', 'death', 'estranged', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'Victor', 'Adam', 'Beach', 'serious', 'angry', 'youth', 'ventures', 'retrieve', 'father', 'ashes', 'craggy', 'desolate', 'hideaway', 'Arizona', 'desert', 'Alongside', 'Victor', 'friend', 'companion', 'Thomas', 'Adam', 'Evans', 'quirky', 'intellectual', 'storyteller-type', 'who', 'lost', 'parents', 'fire', 'twenty', 'years', 'before', 'journey', 'place', 'bus', 'here', 'Thomas', 'Victor', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'how', 'different', 'are', 'Victor', 'always', 'stone-faced', 'reserved', 'Thomas', 'humor', 'wit', 'voyage', 'going', 'even', 'darkest', 'moments', 'One', 'unique', 'things', 'situation', 'Thomas', 'have', 'known', 'Victor', 'father', 'better', 'Victor', 'roadtrip', 'Thomas', 'delivers', 'uncomplicated', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'accounts', 'how', 'relationship', 'Victor', 'father', 'manifested', 'when', 'was', 'boy', 'reasons', 'why', 'man', 'Thomas', 'knew', 'surrogate', 'parent', 'suddenly', 'left', 'one', 'day', 'never', 'be', 'heard', 'again.Thomas', 'mixture', 'distressing', 'story', 'threads', 'interwoven', 'vignettes', 'whimsical', 'humor', 'paints', 'vivid', 'picture', 'boy', 'father', 'disappeared', '1976', 'first', 'time', 'Victor', 'able', 'drop', 'inhibited', 'roughness', 'earnestly', 'respect', 'father', 'what', 'was', 'forgive', 'unanticipated', 'departure.This', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'delicateness', 'family', 'complexities', 'also', 'insight', 'oral', 'tradition', 'Native', 'American', 'storytelling']",Smoke Signals VHS

The mission: collect the remains of the father of Victor Joseph-- played with great complexity by Adam Beach. Along for the ride is Thomas, the local reservation geek who brings along with him a vast array of stories from the past mixed with humor and pain played with resilence by Evan Adams, to the constant annoyance of Victor who has no time for stories or memories, only &quot;truth&quot; and the present tense.This movie is a series of vignettes as the two travel off the reservation (&quot;You're leavin' the Rez and going into a whole different country cousin.&quot; &quot;But it's the United States.&quot; &quot;Damn right it is, that's as foreign as it gets!&quot;) and into the wilderness of forgotten memories and rough landscape. Mixed in with the ponderings of what it means to be indeginous in America and who makes the best fry-bread is a great soundtrack which includes Dar Williams and Ulali.This movie does not try to be more than it is: the story of two young men trying to find their place in the world with humor and anger.

I really miss those scenes and I feel that in the butchered version of the movie, Victor never really does learn anything.  He inherits from his father the great fauly of running away (cowardice) which ruined his life up until Suzy's phone call.  We see her towards the last half of the movie utterly changed by the ingratitude of the boys.Was she supposed to be too old to be romantically interested in Adam Beach?  I don't think so!  Sparks fly between them as actors, but the script carefully tiptoes past any hint of a romance.  Maybe the director felt that involving Suzy with both father and son bordered on the incestuous but, hey, it worked with father and son and now that Arnold Joseph was dead, the message for her should be, time to move on to the luscious, lean, chiseled son played by Adam Beach with a muscular intenstity reminiscent of Alain Delon's brooding profile in Visconti's ROCCO AND HIS BROTHERS.  I kept watching SMOKE SIGNALS admiring the way Chris Eyre took many of Visconti's tropes--for surely he is a fan of ROCCO as well as many other midperiod Visconti masterpieces--and turned them on their head, reigniting them for a new generation.  Though in my opinion by eliminating all sexuality he threw the baby out with the bathwater.Maybe Evan Adams' character was supposed to be in love with Adam Beach's.  The movie is pretty feeble without that suggestion, for why else would Thomas offer his life savings to Victor, and why would he be so excited and tremulous about the prospect of spending six days with him, side by side, braids flapping about his shoulders like wings?  In the hospital the young woman tells the boys, ""You two are my heroes.  You're just like the Lone Ranger and Tonto.""

Like other independent films though, it was a little loosely structured and a bit too long.  However, it's freshness, originality and irreverent modern view of their world more than made up for these faults.The story centers on two young men, Victor and Thomas, who leave their Idaho resevaton to bring back the remains of one the young men's father who had left ten years before.  The early part of the film features sharp humorous dialog which turns some stereotypes around.  For example, Victor tells Thomas that to look like a proper Indian he should stop smiling and look serious, like he just finished killing a buffalo.  Thomas answers that their tribe didn't kill buffalos -- they were fishermen.  As the story progresses, though, it gets more serious.  Told in flashbacks and voiceovers, the role of the father is superbly created by Gary Farmer a large size actor with a huge talent.  He deserves top billing along with the two young men, played by Adam Beach and Evan Adams.  The film is strongest when dealing with the relationship between sons and fathers.  There are some very moving moments around this theme.Do see this video.  Despite it's minor faults, it will enrich your knowledge of Native Americans and tell a good story as well.

It's about a journey that two totally different Native American young men take to discover a father and a hero that, they discover, they really did not know. The first is Thomas, whose parents were killed in the tragic fire when he was a baby. He was spared in a dramatic rescue by Victor Joseph's father. Thomas is raised by his grandparents and turns out to be the town nerd-hands down. Victor Joseph grows up stoic and masculine and tough, what you might expect for someone whose father one day walked out on him and his mother and left them to fend for themselves. Word comes that his father has died and his ashes are waiting to be picked up. He has no money for the bus ticket but Thomas does and offers to pay his way if he can go along. They both have very different memories of the man. Which one is the truth? The bus ride and what they discover when they get there is the heart of this often funny, but equally often serious and reflective film.

454541,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305210101,Matthew Horner,"[3, 3]","There have been precious few movies about Native Americans in the last decade. Perhaps this is because the fate of the original inhabitants of this nation will forever be a sad and controversial chapter in history. Movies are a huge entertainment machine, and the subject is not usually seen as being a crowd-pleaser.Enter Smoke Signals. This delightful, off beat comedy-drama is primarily a Native Americans production. From its unique vantage point, we are shown that they do, indeed exist and that, regardless of the circumstances some of them live in, the human spirit often still triumphs.Most of the picture was filmed on a reservation in Idaho. The rest takes place in Seattle and in Phoenix. It is a fascinating portrayal of two young Coeur D'Alcoc men named Victor Joseph and Thomas Builds-the-Fire. Thomas, played by Adam Beach, is a bookish boy who is in touch with the sprit world. His parents were killed in a 4th of July fire when he was an infant. Saved by Victor's father, her was raised by his grandmother. The boys have grow up together, but could not be more different. Victor is a hot tempered jock who bears several grudges. He feels that his being born on a reservation is an enormous handicap, and he resents his father's leaving him when he was ten years old.In less capable hands, life on the reservation would appear grim, but director Chris Eyre has a gift for seeing the humor in a situation. The tribe has a radio station, for example. Every morning it has a rush hour report, which consists of a reporter sitting on top of a truck at the nearest highway and commenting on the few cars that pass buy. The truck has not moved since it broke down twenty years ago. In another instance, two teenage girls drive around in an old car which only runs in reverse. These amusing scenes gently show both the poverty and the isolation of the reservation, which is so different from the rest of American that it looks like it's in a third world country.Victor and his mother learn that his Dad has died in Phoenix. He must go there to get the remains, and he reluctantly lets Thomas accompany him. Thomas is forever telling stories about real events, but he always puts a spiritual meaning into them. This drives Victor up the wall.On the road to Phoenix, bits and pieces from their past are revealed. We learn the truth about the death of Thomas' parents, and we find out why Victor's father really left. This is done in constant but smooth shifts from present to past which.This small movie has much more to say - and says it better - than the average big budget production. Issues are addressed which make the audience more aware of the Native American experience, but the tone is objective.

454551,A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5,6305210101,R. Kyle,"[3, 3]","""Smoke Signals"" is a 1998 film based on short stories from Sherman Alexie's book ""Tonto and the Lone Ranger Fistfight in Heaven."" This is one of the first films directed by, written by, acted by and crewed by a full Native American team.The story is about two unlikely young Native American men who are traveling together to retrieve Arnold Joseph (Gary Farmer's) ashes.  Victor Joseph (Adam Beach) is the son that Arnold abandoned ten years before when his parents got into a drunken brawl.  Thomas Builds-The-Fire (Evan Adams) is the same age as Victor and was saved by Arnold in a house fire that killed both of his parents.Both have an entirely different point of view of the man who in a sense gave them their lives.  Along the way, Thomas nearly drives Victor crazy with his storytelling of his father. Victor remains silent and angry about the family's parting.In Phoenix, they meet Suzy Song (Irene Bedard) who loved Arnold and has an entirely different story to tell.  Nobody's story is completely true, but when all the disjointed pieces come together they make a poetic sense.Both the journey and the stories are beautifully told with humor and grace.  The music is a great counterpoint to the tale, just enough but not overpowering.Overall, ""Smoke Signals"" is very watchable and definitely a film I would want to own and recommend to friends.Rebecca Kyle, July 2008",5,A story is only as good as all of its parts,1216166400,"07 16, 2008",2008,1377,"['Smoke', 'Signals', '1998', 'film', 'based', 'short', 'stories', 'Sherman', 'Alexie', 'book', 'Tonto', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'Fistfight', 'Heaven', 'one', 'first', 'films', 'directed', 'written', 'acted', 'crewed', 'full', 'Native', 'American', 'team.The', 'story', 'two', 'unlikely', 'young', 'Native', 'American', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'traveling', 'together', 'retrieve', 'Arnold', 'Joseph', 'Gary', 'Farmer', 'ashes', 'Victor', 'Joseph', 'Adam', 'Beach', 'son', 'Arnold', 'abandoned', 'ten', 'years', 'when', 'parents', 'got', 'drunken', 'brawl', 'Thomas', 'Builds-The-Fire', 'Evan', 'Adams', 'same', 'age', 'Victor', 'was', 'saved', 'Arnold', 'house', 'fire', 'killed', 'parents.Both', 'have', 'entirely', 'different', 'point', 'view', 'man', 'who', 'sense', 'gave', 'lives', 'way', 'Thomas', 'nearly', 'Victor', 'crazy', 'storytelling', 'father', 'Victor', 'silent', 'angry', 'family', 'parting.In', 'Phoenix', 'meet', 'Suzy', 'Song', 'Irene', 'Bedard', 'who', 'loved', 'Arnold', 'entirely', 'different', 'story', 'tell', 'Nobody', 'story', 'completely', 'true', 'when', 'disjointed', 'pieces', 'come', 'together', 'make', 'poetic', 'sense.Both', 'journey', 'stories', 'are', 'beautifully', 'told', 'humor', 'grace', 'music', 'great', 'counterpoint', 'tale', 'just', 'enough', 'not', 'overpowering.Overall', 'Smoke', 'Signals', 'very', 'watchable', 'definitely', 'film', 'would', 'want', 'own', 'recommend', 'friends.Rebecca', 'Kyle', 'July', '2008']",Smoke Signals VHS

454554,AOSQ5JIA2X4M,6305210101,"""rrr338""","[14, 15]","&quot;Smoke Signals&quot; is that most refreshing of movie projects -- one that defies many of the Hollywood conventions, yet still conveys a story to which everyone can relate.Yes, the film (based on Native American  author Sherman Alexie's &quot;The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fight in  Heaven&quot;)is told from a Native perspective. The first surprise?  It  does not rattle off an angry tirade against white domination (not that such  isn't understandable).  Instead, it pokes gentle fun at the ways in which  non-Indians stereotype tribal people, and often deny them a place in the  contemporary world. The jokes are funny, and while many are really  &quot;inside&quot; jokes that Native Americans will more fully appreciate,  they are still appealing to a wider audience.There are other surprises.  A scene that suggests the start of a violent confrontation forgoes the  &quot;Rambo&quot; outburst and instead gives us a contemplative and  somewhat ironic turn of events.  Another scene sets up the audience for  expecting  big trouble, only to pull the rug out and show a humorous  resolution.  Even so, this is a serious film in many ways.  It's about how  we remember a painful past, it's about finding ways to forgive even when we  don't fully understand the past.  It's about Native Americans... but also  about being human.  That's it's strong point -- it manages to humanize both  the Native American characters as well as people in general all in the same  stroke. This film will take on historical importance, for it goes a longer  way than any previous film in fostering understanding and acceptance of  First Nation people.Besides the compelling story, this film offers you  some marvelously &quot;quirky&quot; performances, unlike what Hollywood  customarily dishes out.  Thomas and Victor just become more and more  endearing as the film progresses, awkward mannerisms and all.

It is based on the novel &quot;The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven&quot; by Sherman Alexie, who also published a movie adaptation of &quot;Smoke Signals&quot; as well.The majority of the cast is from a variety of Canadian First Nations tribes (Coast Salish, Cree, Cayuga, Ojibwa), so there are different cultural backgrounds at work as well. &quot;Smoke Signals&quot; is a journey of the heart, an exploration of what it means to be Indian, venturing into the world outside the rez. Thomas's stories are part Indian legend, part reweaving of the facts surrounding Victor and his father.The story follows Victor Joseph as he goes to collect the remains of his father, who had abandoned his family and moved to Arizona (the film's working title was &quot;This Is What It Means To Say Phoenix, Arizona,&quot; based on a chapter of &quot;The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven.&quot; His wise friend Thomas Builds-the-Fire goes with him on a trip from their rez in Coeur-d'Alene, Idaho to Arnold Joseph's trailer in Arizona. Along the way they rediscover their pasts and their perceptions of the world around them.An unusual, touching film that pokes fun at the stoic Indian stereotypes endorsed by Hollywood for decades, such as the &quot;It's a good day to die&quot; line.

Best of all, few have seen it so all can start at the same point and not get bored with something they had seen.

Every time i went to the video store i would see it there, just waiting..........waiting for someone to notice it..........waiting for me to pick it up off the  shelf and rent it.  But intead i would just pass it by and look for  something more conventional, an &quot;easy-rent&quot; so to speak.  Something that i heard of, more like.  I had many opportunities to rent  &quot;Smoke Signals&quot; but it always seemed to get the back burner.  One  day, i rented &quot;American History X&quot; (which i placed myself on a  waiting list for) and was thrilled that i finally would get to see it!  I  wanted to picked one more movie for &quot;back-up&quot; so i could do the  whole &quot;double-feature thing&quot;.  Can you guess which movie i chose?  If you guessed &quot;Smoke Signals&quot; you are correct.  To make a long  story short, the movie that i had been obsessing about (American History X)  turned out to be a very asanine, negative movie with alot of violence.  A  total dissapointment.  Smoke Signals however was such a sweet surprise.  This movie takes you to a beautiful part of the country we seldom see.  It  covers the lives of native American indians we also seldom see in the  movies.  Not only that, it is a positive depiction of the native American  culture and shows their affinity to nature, family and spirit.  The  characters in this film grow on you as the movie takes it's course,  characters with a lot of personality and depth, and whom you will remember.  I think that is so important in a film.  After the movie ended, it left me  with a good feeling, which is quite rare for a film to do nowadays.  This  is one of the best films i have seen in current release.  And there it was  the whole time........waiting patiently, totally understated and as i turns  out totally worth it. Forget all the negative, action packed, car crashing,  bombs exploding, cool guns and hot sex type movies.  Escape to a better  place, let your soul feel good again.  After viewing &quot;Smoke  Signals&quot; i went out and purchased it.  It is definately one to own in  my opinion.",5,&quot;Smokin&quot;!,932774400,"07 24, 1999",1999,2154,"['friend', 'mine', 'recommended', 'movie', 'while', 'back', 'Every', 'time', 'i', 'went', 'video', 'store', 'i', 'would', 'see', 'there', 'just', 'waiting', '.waiting', 'someone', 'notice', '.waiting', 'pick', 'up', 'shelf', 'rent', 'intead', 'i', 'would', 'just', 'pass', 'look', 'something', 'more', 'conventional', 'quot', 'easy-rent', 'quot', 'so', 'speak', 'Something', 'i', 'heard', 'more', 'had', 'many', 'opportunities', 'rent', 'quot', 'Smoke', 'Signals', 'quot', 'always', 'seemed', 'get', 'back', 'burner', 'One', 'day', 'i', 'rented', 'quot', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'quot', 'i', 'placed', 'waiting', 'list', 'was', 'thrilled', 'i', 'finally', 'would', 'get', 'see', 'wanted', 'picked', 'one', 'more', 'movie', 'quot', 'back-up', 'quot', 'i', 'could', 'do', 'whole', 'quot', 'double-feature', 'thing', 'quot', 'Can', 'guess', 'movie', 'i', 'chose', 'guessed', 'quot', 'Smoke', 'Signals', 'quot', 'are', 'correct', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'movie', 'i', 'had', 'been', 'obsessing', 'about', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'asanine', 'negative', 'movie', 'alot', 'violence', 'total', 'dissapointment', 'Smoke', 'Signals', 'however', 'was', 'such', 'sweet', 'surprise', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'part', 'country', 'seldom', 'see', 'lives', 'native', 'American', 'indians', 'also', 'seldom', 'see', 'movies', 'Not', 'only', 'positive', 'depiction', 'native', 'American', 'culture', 'affinity', 'nature', 'family', 'spirit', 'characters', 'film', 'grow', 'movie', 'course', 'characters', 'lot', 'personality', 'depth', 'whom', 'will', 'remember', 'think', 'so', 'important', 'film', 'movie', 'ended', 'left', 'good', 'feeling', 'quite', 'rare', 'film', 'do', 'nowadays', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'i', 'have', 'seen', 'current', 'release', 'was', 'whole', 'time', '..waiting', 'patiently', 'totally', 'understated', 'i', 'out', 'totally', 'worth', 'Forget', 'negative', 'action', 'packed', 'car', 'crashing', 'bombs', 'exploding', 'cool', 'guns', 'hot', 'sex', 'type', 'movies', 'Escape', 'better', 'place', 'let', 'soul', 'feel', 'good', 'again', 'viewing', 'quot', 'Smoke', 'Signals', 'quot', 'went', 'purchased', 'definately', 'one', 'own', 'opinion']",Smoke Signals VHS
