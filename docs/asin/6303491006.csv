377636,A2EWA6WBOJO1QC,6303491006,"bdlion ""Have Gun Will Travel""","[6, 8]","This movie is worth seeing just for Gregory Peck, who never made a bad movie. Here he is in Atticus Finch mode in an old West setting, and Peck pulls it off grandly. This is not a film without flaws (such as Peck letting his guard down in a widow's ranch house with the bad guys hot on his trail- he had to have known they would be following him), but there are genuine moments of suspense and tension, especially a ""William Tell"" like sequence where villian Robert Lyons attempts to shoot tea cups off the head of the little girl. Overall, a western worth seeing.As far as the audio/video quality, both are very good to excellent. This disc is one of the ""Universal Vault Series"" manufactured-on-demand (MOD) discs, similar to the Warner Archives discs. I watched this disc on a 60 inch Sony Bravia HD-TV, using a Panasonic Bluray player. The video image transfer was excellent and looked like a mass produced retail DVD. My sound system has 7.1 surround sound, and the audio of this disc was also very good. I did not have to turn the volume up very loud to enjoy full stereo sound.The colors are rich, especially in some of the scenes involving broad vistas and panoramic shots. The darks looked good with little to no artifacting. I have purchased about five of these Universal MOD discs, and SHOOT OUT is the first one I've watched. Overall, I am very pleased with the quality of this MOD disc.It is unfortunate if MOD is the future of DVD, with the studios no longer producing pressed DVD's of their catalog titles, but on the other hand, I'd rather have these films on DVD, even MOD, than not have them at all.",4,Vault Series Scores One,1266364800,"02 17, 2010",2010,1617,"['movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'just', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'who', 'never', 'made', 'bad', 'movie', 'Here', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'mode', 'old', 'West', 'setting', 'Peck', 'off', 'grandly', 'not', 'film', 'flaws', 'such', 'Peck', 'letting', 'guard', 'down', 'widow', 'ranch', 'house', 'bad', 'guys', 'hot', 'trail-', 'had', 'have', 'known', 'would', 'be', 'following', 'are', 'genuine', 'moments', 'suspense', 'tension', 'especially', 'William', 'Tell', 'sequence', 'where', 'villian', 'Robert', 'Lyons', 'attempts', 'shoot', 'tea', 'cups', 'head', 'little', 'girl', 'Overall', 'western', 'worth', 'seeing.As', 'far', 'audio/video', 'quality', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'excellent', 'disc', 'one', 'Universal', 'Vault', 'Series', 'manufactured-on-demand', 'MOD', 'discs', 'similar', 'Warner', 'Archives', 'discs', 'watched', 'disc', '60', 'inch', 'Sony', 'Bravia', 'HD-TV', 'using', 'Panasonic', 'Bluray', 'player', 'video', 'image', 'transfer', 'was', 'excellent', 'looked', 'mass', 'produced', 'retail', 'DVD', 'My', 'sound', 'system', '7.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'audio', 'disc', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'turn', 'volume', 'up', 'very', 'loud', 'enjoy', 'full', 'stereo', 'sound.The', 'colors', 'are', 'rich', 'especially', 'scenes', 'involving', 'broad', 'vistas', 'panoramic', 'shots', 'darks', 'looked', 'good', 'little', 'artifacting', 'have', 'purchased', 'five', 'Universal', 'MOD', 'discs', 'SHOOT', 'OUT', 'first', 'one', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Overall', 'am', 'very', 'pleased', 'quality', 'MOD', 'disc.It', 'unfortunate', 'MOD', 'future', 'DVD', 'studios', 'longer', 'producing', 'pressed', 'DVD', 'catalog', 'titles', 'other', 'hand', ""'d"", 'rather', 'have', 'films', 'DVD', 'even', 'MOD', 'not', 'have']",Shoot Out VHS

377639,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,6303491006,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[5, 5]","The modestly budgeted 1971 western ""Shoot Out"" was touted as the second coming ofTrue Grit (Special Collector's Edition). And rightfully so, with the same director, screenplay writer, producer, not to mention a reminiscent storyline of a young girl warming the heart of the veteran gunfighter. Even the locations appear familiar, with the rugged hills and glistening streams of New Mexico and California's Inyo Forest. I suppose comparisons end there, as today ""True Grit"" remains one of the most beloved films in history, inspiring the superb remakeTrue Grit (2010). On the other hand, ""Shoot Out"" is almost completely forgotten.I'm not touting a revival of ""Shoot Out,"" as it's not very good. It lacks the backbone of Charles Portis' brilliant novelTrue Gritand the villains of this film are so broadly drawn as to resemble something from a Hells Angels biker fest. I watched it recently for the first time in years and was amazed by the lack of magic, though Gregory Peck provides a few sparks. One of the most famous actors in history, Peck's career had essentially stalled by the time he arrived on the set of this film. He would achieve an amazing comeback in 1976 with the horror blockbusterThe Omen, and yet for me there's an end-of-an-era chord about this placidly average oater. This would be one of director Henry Hathaway's final films, a tough cuss who carved good westerns for much of his career (The Sons of Katie Elder,Nevada Smith). If you squint your eyes you'll spot Howard Hawks' fave Arthur Hunnicut in a supporting role. Even Jeff Corey, the venerable Chaney from ""True Grit,"" is on hand as an elder informant. There was a lot of gray hair surrounding the camera, producing an assembly line western perhaps more commonplace in the 1950s.A grizzled Peck plays Clay Lomax, arriving in town after years in jail. He was double-crossed and is searching for his former partner, portrayed by Dick Gregory, who played these villainous roles for decades. Peck discovers his ex-girlfriend died but left him a young daughter named Decky. Dawn Lyn, who had a nice career in the 1970s in children roles most famously in the seriesMy Three Sons: Season Two, Vols. 1 & 2, plays the perky Decky, who joins Peck on his revenge quest. There are comical scenes when she's forced to take a bath and soon they warm to each others' company. ""Shoot Out"" would have been well served to focus on the budding father-daughter relationship. But soon Peck's former partner and youthful henchmen are terrorizing the pair, at one point shooting an apple off the child's head. These distasteful scenes capsize the entire film, though Peck has the opportunity to teach the young ""punks"" a lesson.It was probably a summer night in 1971, as I remember it was warm. My mom, aunt, cousins and I - six of us - piled into the car and drove to the local drive-in to see this film. We brought pillows and lawn chairs and undoubtedly purchased hot dogs at the concession stand. It was a family outing under the Texas stars to see a western with Gregory Peck. I doubt we drove away that night thinking it was the greatest film sinceThe Big Country. But the experience, when life was young, before adulthood renders us into tired souls, was a communal moment amidst family. The memory has granted me a fondness for ""Shoot Out,"" diluted somewhat when viewed today.Thousands of average westerns from previous decades have been forgotten over the years. ""Shoot Out"" was essentially at the end, when the genre that supported so many lives was disappearing. All of those wonderful TV series with Barbara Stanwyck, Clint Walker and Leif Erickson were being quietly canceled, akin to the drive-ins shutting down around South Dallas once thriving with families. Because of ""Shoot Out,"" I can say I saw at least one western at the drive-in.""Shoot-Out"" will not make the top of anybody's career list. It does represent a moment when old-guard careers were limping towards the end. Is it the final gasp of a great American genre? Not quite, but it's a product forged by weathered hands, a twilight ride on a trail disappearing fast.",3,Forged by weathered hands...,1350691200,"10 20, 2012",2012,4099,"['modestly', 'budgeted', '1971', 'western', 'Shoot', 'Out', 'was', 'touted', 'second', 'coming', 'ofTrue', 'Grit', 'Special', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'rightfully', 'so', 'same', 'director', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'producer', 'not', 'mention', 'reminiscent', 'storyline', 'young', 'girl', 'warming', 'heart', 'veteran', 'gunfighter', 'Even', 'locations', 'appear', 'familiar', 'rugged', 'hills', 'glistening', 'streams', 'New', 'Mexico', 'California', 'Inyo', 'Forest', 'suppose', 'comparisons', 'end', 'there', 'today', 'True', 'Grit', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'films', 'history', 'inspiring', 'superb', 'remakeTrue', 'Grit', '2010', 'other', 'hand', 'Shoot', 'Out', 'almost', 'completely', 'forgotten.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'touting', 'revival', 'Shoot', 'Out', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'backbone', 'Charles', 'Portis', 'brilliant', 'novelTrue', 'Gritand', 'villains', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'broadly', 'drawn', 'resemble', 'something', 'Hells', 'Angels', 'biker', 'fest', 'watched', 'recently', 'first', 'time', 'years', 'was', 'amazed', 'lack', 'magic', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'few', 'sparks', 'One', 'most', 'famous', 'actors', 'history', 'Peck', 'career', 'had', 'essentially', 'stalled', 'time', 'arrived', 'set', 'film', 'would', 'achieve', 'amazing', 'comeback', '1976', 'horror', 'blockbusterThe', 'Omen', 'yet', 'end-of-an-era', 'chord', 'placidly', 'average', 'oater', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'director', 'Henry', 'Hathaway', 'final', 'films', 'tough', 'cuss', 'who', 'carved', 'good', 'westerns', 'much', 'career', 'Sons', 'Katie', 'Elder', 'Nevada', 'Smith', 'squint', 'eyes', ""'ll"", 'spot', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'fave', 'Arthur', 'Hunnicut', 'supporting', 'role', 'Even', 'Jeff', 'Corey', 'venerable', 'Chaney', 'True', 'Grit', 'hand', 'elder', 'informant', 'was', 'lot', 'gray', 'hair', 'surrounding', 'camera', 'producing', 'assembly', 'line', 'western', 'perhaps', 'more', 'commonplace', '1950s.A', 'grizzled', 'Peck', 'plays', 'Clay', 'Lomax', 'arriving', 'town', 'years', 'jail', 'was', 'double-crossed', 'searching', 'former', 'partner', 'portrayed', 'Dick', 'Gregory', 'who', 'played', 'villainous', 'roles', 'decades', 'Peck', 'ex-girlfriend', 'died', 'left', 'young', 'daughter', 'named', 'Decky', 'Dawn', 'Lyn', 'who', 'had', 'nice', 'career', '1970s', 'children', 'roles', 'most', 'famously', 'seriesMy', 'Three', 'Sons', 'Season', 'Two', 'Vols', '1', '2', 'perky', 'Decky', 'who', 'Peck', 'revenge', 'quest', 'are', 'comical', 'scenes', 'when', 'forced', 'take', 'bath', 'soon', 'warm', 'others', 'company', 'Shoot', 'Out', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'well', 'served', 'focus', 'budding', 'father-daughter', 'relationship', 'soon', 'Peck', 'former', 'partner', 'youthful', 'henchmen', 'are', 'terrorizing', 'pair', 'one', 'point', 'shooting', 'apple', 'child', 'head', 'distasteful', 'scenes', 'capsize', 'entire', 'film', 'Peck', 'opportunity', 'teach', 'young', 'punks', 'lesson.It', 'was', 'probably', 'summer', 'night', '1971', 'remember', 'was', 'warm', 'mom', 'aunt', 'cousins', 'six', 'piled', 'car', 'drove', 'local', 'drive-in', 'see', 'film', 'brought', 'pillows', 'lawn', 'chairs', 'undoubtedly', 'purchased', 'hot', 'dogs', 'concession', 'stand', 'was', 'family', 'outing', 'Texas', 'stars', 'see', 'western', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'doubt', 'drove', 'away', 'night', 'thinking', 'was', 'greatest', 'film', 'sinceThe', 'Big', 'Country', 'experience', 'when', 'life', 'was', 'young', 'adulthood', 'renders', 'tired', 'souls', 'was', 'communal', 'moment', 'amidst', 'family', 'memory', 'granted', 'fondness', 'Shoot', 'Out', 'diluted', 'somewhat', 'when', 'viewed', 'today.Thousands', 'average', 'westerns', 'previous', 'decades', 'have', 'been', 'forgotten', 'years', 'Shoot', 'Out', 'was', 'essentially', 'end', 'when', 'genre', 'supported', 'so', 'many', 'lives', 'was', 'disappearing', 'wonderful', 'TV', 'series', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'Clint', 'Walker', 'Leif', 'Erickson', 'were', 'being', 'quietly', 'canceled', 'akin', 'drive-ins', 'shutting', 'down', 'around', 'South', 'Dallas', 'once', 'thriving', 'families', 'Shoot', 'Out', 'can', 'say', 'saw', 'least', 'one', 'western', 'drive-in', 'Shoot-Out', 'will', 'not', 'make', 'top', 'anybody', 'career', 'list', 'represent', 'moment', 'when', 'old-guard', 'careers', 'were', 'limping', 'end', 'final', 'gasp', 'great', 'American', 'genre', 'Not', 'quite', 'product', 'forged', 'weathered', 'hands', 'twilight', 'ride', 'trail', 'disappearing', 'fast']",Shoot Out VHS

Although the negative comments that have been posted are generally accurate, the film has several elements that make it worth watching. Imagine combining 'To Kill a Mockingbird' with 'One-Eyed Jacks' and you will have a pretty good idea of what this story is all about. Unfortunately Gregory Peck did not put Aticus Finch energy into the Clay Lomax character, and even though Dawn Lyn (Dodie from 'My Three Sons') is fine as the little girl-the idea just doesn't work. There is at least one story too many in this movie and it would take a great script to pull it together. But as someone has already mentioned this is not a great script and there are 1970's dialogue issues that periodically jar the viewer back to reality, making it impossible for this thing to ever really get going.On the plus side Robert Lyons gives a nice 'really out there' performance as the wacko bad guy. Lyons was that era's Gary Oldham. Also the production designer did a good job on the overall feel of the film, there several absolutely great visuals (check out the shot of Dawn Lyn standing on the train station platform), and there is a very original non-formula climax. The production has excellent overall unity and someone really paid attention to continuity issues (watch how the progress of the water dripping on the cabin table is matched to the time sequence of the scene).What stayed with me through the years and motivated me to watch this again was the first film performance of Susan Tyrrell, as the dumb but plucky saloon girl. She actually deserved a supporting actress nomination.  Then she played dumb and plucky again in 'Fat City' and actually received a Supporting Actress Nomination. At the time I was convinced that she would be the next big female star. There was a young actress talent vacuum in the 1969-78 period and hack blondes like Candice Bergen and Cybill Sheppard got a lot of work-with very painful to watch results.

Shakespeare used it four times and by 1858 in the United States was used not only as rotten wood used for starting a fire... but as term for worthless young man.  Sorry... it is *not* '70s slang...
