888455,A13DD17X1AZFGJ,B0007R4TJ4,A. Butterfield,"[3, 6]","Ian McEwan's novel was one of the highlights of the year for me when it was published. I was interested to see the film version, but had low expectations. Anybody who has read the book will know that one of its themes was the unreliability of the main character's perception of events. This is difficult to achieve in a film and largely the director doesn't try to do it. He gets around it by changing the story. This will either annoy you, or not. Call it artistic licence.What's left makes a neat film, but not a great one. What most people remember about the novel is the pivotal opening sequence of events when a hot air balloon gets out of control. Luckily, this scene is transferred to film perfectly.I liked other things: Daniel Craig mostly plays his character well, looks right, sounds right (although I'm not sure I 'liked' him); the cinematography is interesting, with odd over-the-shoulder camera angles that only gradually reveal what's happening - like a movie version of an unfolding description in a novel.I didn't much care for the dumbed-down Clarissa (called Claire in the film for some reason) character, nor Bill Nighy, nor the look of Joe's stalker. Nor did I care for some of the university scenes, which were a little embarrassing and dated.But it was better than I expected. If you haven't read the book, I expect you would enjoy it more.

Your view of the ground below is hypnotizing - it looks like a map - there's virtually no sound at all, and they're very stable.  But what you notice most is the pace, hot air balloons move at such a lazy clip it's as though time itself is limitless.  The entire effect is incredibly soothing.The deliberate crawl of Enduring Love takes its cue from ballooning, as the ballooning tragedy that begins it defines what will happen.  Joe, the protagonist, (played with convincing angst by Daniel Craig), is a professor who has embraced a profoundly nihilistic world view.  In Jed, (brilliantly realized by Rhys Ifans), he must confront the totally other, something that falls well outside of his ability to impose rationality on the world.As Jed throws himself into Joe's life with increasing passion, (for reasons none of us truly understand, including Jed), Joe's house of cards begins to fall.  (Great to see Bill Nighy as Robin, one of Joe's friends, he is about as consistently good as an actor can be.  Samantha Morton plays Joe's paramour with compelling feeling, her understated approach works much better here than it did in Code 46.)  That Jed is not merely weird, but quite mad, only becomes evident incrementally.  In this gradual process of revelation, Joe's own madness is forced to the surface.Roger Michell directed Enduring Love with tremendous confidence; we drift into the inevitable conflict almost without noticing the scenery passing by.  This restraint has a wonderful way of building tension and making it possible for us to care about Joe who, truth be told, is not the most charming bloke in town.  But his sense of claustrophobia and mounting tension make us worry about him at least, if not root for him.  The film is also admirable in its refusal to provide glib, saccharine answers to the thorny questions it asks.

888457,A1R602SXNGOMJ4,B0007R4TJ4,A. Vegan,"[8, 12]","Ian McEwan's gripping and disturbing psychological thriller has, alas, been turned into a frustratingly dull movie. Despite a successful depiction of the shocking balloon accident that sets the story in motion, director Roger Michell fails after this stylish opening to generate any of the psychological tension that made the novel such a page-turner. Characters that seemed multi-faceted and tormented in print seem merely bland and humourless on screen. Far from making one sweat with fear, the basic ""temperature"" of the film is glacial (and I don't mean chilling). I don't think this is necessarily the fault of the actors: while they are unable to kickstart the film into something resembling life Daniel Craig and Samantha Morton nevertheless bring intensity and integrity to their roles as Joe and Claire. Rhys Ifans, unfortunately, seems to me simply miscast as flaky loner Jed (Ifans is the wrong kind of flaky). Nor can I recall Jed's menace or madness being made so explicit so quickly in the novel. It kind of sneaks up quietly on you rather than being as telegraphed as it is here. Much of the ""inner drama"" of Joe and Claire's relationship breakdown is lost in translation. One is left with a sequence of meals and dinner parties which provide the backdrop for a chronicle of Joe's deterioration, without particularly managing to illuminate it. And the fact that Joe never goes to the police (or even seems to consider involving them) even when Jed's stalking of him is well-established and increasingly disruptive, is a major plot weakness which the more nuanced novel manages to get away with but which seems a glaring failure of story-telling on screen. It's hard to empathize with a character who lets things get out of hand so easily.",2,Very disappointing,1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,1753,"['Ian', 'McEwan', 'gripping', 'disturbing', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'alas', 'been', 'turned', 'frustratingly', 'dull', 'movie', 'successful', 'depiction', 'shocking', 'balloon', 'accident', 'story', 'motion', 'director', 'Roger', 'Michell', 'stylish', 'opening', 'generate', 'psychological', 'tension', 'made', 'novel', 'such', 'page-turner', 'Characters', 'seemed', 'multi-faceted', 'tormented', 'print', 'seem', 'merely', 'bland', 'humourless', 'screen', 'Far', 'making', 'one', 'sweat', 'fear', 'basic', 'temperature', 'film', 'glacial', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'chilling', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'necessarily', 'fault', 'actors', 'are', 'unable', 'kickstart', 'film', 'something', 'resembling', 'life', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'nevertheless', 'bring', 'intensity', 'integrity', 'roles', 'Joe', 'Claire', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'unfortunately', 'simply', 'miscast', 'flaky', 'loner', 'Jed', 'Ifans', 'wrong', 'kind', 'flaky', 'can', 'recall', 'Jed', 'menace', 'madness', 'being', 'made', 'so', 'explicit', 'so', 'quickly', 'novel', 'kind', 'sneaks', 'up', 'quietly', 'rather', 'being', 'as', 'telegraphed', 'here', 'Much', 'inner', 'drama', 'Joe', 'Claire', 'relationship', 'breakdown', 'lost', 'translation', 'One', 'left', 'sequence', 'meals', 'dinner', 'parties', 'provide', 'backdrop', 'chronicle', 'Joe', 'deterioration', 'particularly', 'managing', 'illuminate', 'fact', 'Joe', 'never', 'police', 'even', 'consider', 'involving', 'even', 'when', 'Jed', 'stalking', 'well-established', 'increasingly', 'disruptive', 'major', 'plot', 'weakness', 'more', 'nuanced', 'novel', 'manages', 'get', 'away', 'glaring', 'failure', 'story-telling', 'screen', 'hard', 'empathize', 'character', 'who', 'things', 'get', 'hand', 'so', 'easily']",Enduring Love
888458,A38ZCGX5970J1M,B0007R4TJ4,"C. A. Stone ""lupusstone""","[3, 3]","To truly appreciate this movie, I think, is to see it as largely metaphorical.  Those critics who dismissed it as typical--and not very interesting--stalker fare have completely missed the boat, and I daresay are not observant or imaginitive enough to be good at their jobs.  For the central question the film poses reflects the double meaning in the title:  Can real, emotional love be enduring, or is it merely something to be endured?  Is love a cruel trick of basic animal biology, as unreliable and enexpected as a sudden gust of wind?  What happens to us if we hang on too long (we risk destroying ourselves), or if we let go too soon (we are consumed by guilt, fantasy, and what-ifs)?Jed and Joe meet as strangers when they both attempt to rescue a boy in a runaway hot air balloon, an attempt that results in the death of another would-be rescuer.  Joe is plagued by survivor's guilt and clearly could use a good therapist.  Jed, on the other hand, could use a whole TEAM of aggressive therapists.  He quickly latches onto Joe quite obsessively, and lays out his theory to him:  they were destined to meet and be together.  Joe cannot handle this any more than he can handle his own self-doubt and hypocrisy.  Is Joe just a nihilist and Jed a hopeless romantic?I think the filmmakers want us to see a bigger picture, here.  Joe is a college humanities professor who lectures on the folly--as he sees it--of basic human morals and ethics.  Jed seems guided simply by his gut and his belief that everything happens for a reason.  Perhaps inevitably, there is a final, violent confrontation between the two men (which, again, many critics dismissed as sloppily predictable) but to me it raises even more interesting questions about the nature of obsession, love, and the ways these nagging questions manifest themselves in our psyches and actions.",5,A fascinating exploration of the psychological nature of love,1186444800,"08 7, 2007",2007,1852,"['truly', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'think', 'see', 'largely', 'metaphorical', 'critics', 'who', 'dismissed', 'typical', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'stalker', 'fare', 'have', 'completely', 'missed', 'boat', 'daresay', 'are', 'not', 'observant', 'imaginitive', 'enough', 'be', 'good', 'jobs', 'central', 'question', 'film', 'double', 'meaning', 'title', 'Can', 'real', 'emotional', 'love', 'be', 'enduring', 'merely', 'something', 'be', 'endured', 'cruel', 'trick', 'basic', 'animal', 'biology', 'unreliable', 'enexpected', 'sudden', 'gust', 'wind', 'What', 'hang', 'too', 'long', 'risk', 'destroying', 'let', 'go', 'too', 'soon', 'are', 'consumed', 'guilt', 'fantasy', 'what-ifs', 'Jed', 'Joe', 'meet', 'strangers', 'when', 'attempt', 'rescue', 'boy', 'runaway', 'hot', 'air', 'balloon', 'attempt', 'results', 'death', 'would-be', 'rescuer', 'Joe', 'plagued', 'survivor', 'guilt', 'clearly', 'could', 'use', 'good', 'therapist', 'Jed', 'other', 'hand', 'could', 'use', 'whole', 'TEAM', 'aggressive', 'therapists', 'quickly', 'Joe', 'quite', 'obsessively', 'out', 'theory', 'were', 'destined', 'meet', 'be', 'together', 'Joe', 'can', 'not', 'handle', 'more', 'can', 'handle', 'own', 'self-doubt', 'hypocrisy', 'Joe', 'just', 'nihilist', 'Jed', 'hopeless', 'romantic', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'want', 'see', 'bigger', 'picture', 'here', 'Joe', 'college', 'humanities', 'professor', 'who', 'folly', 'basic', 'human', 'morals', 'ethics', 'Jed', 'guided', 'simply', 'gut', 'belief', 'everything', 'happens', 'reason', 'Perhaps', 'inevitably', 'final', 'violent', 'confrontation', 'two', 'men', 'again', 'many', 'critics', 'dismissed', 'sloppily', 'predictable', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'questions', 'nature', 'obsession', 'love', 'ways', 'nagging', 'questions', 'manifest', 'psyches', 'actions']",Enduring Love
888459,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B0007R4TJ4,C. B Collins Jr.,"[0, 0]","Let me start by saying that the excellent book, Enduring Love, by Ian McEwan, and the very good filmed version are two distinct works of art and there is enough divergence in emphasis that one can not be compared to the other. I strongly suggest that the book and the film be enjoyed and analyzed separately since there were modifications and adaptations made during the script-writing process that makes the film a unique stand alone product and not just a film about an excellent book.The pace of this film is interesting and noteworthy since it involves how everyday people in everyday life respond to both unexpected tragic and emotionally disturbing situations. Daniel Craig is excellent as a college professor and Samantha Morton as his sculptress lover. They are both masterful actors who bring a sense of reality to the odd situations they encounter in this film.A terrible accident and tragedy initiates the film and brings Joe (played by Craig) in first contact with Jed (Rhys Ifans), his dark tormentor. Joe has adopted a biological deterministic view of sexual relationships, love, and love making. He introduces this to the college class he teaches on English romantic poetry. Thus he sees romantic love as a purely biologically driven impulse created so that humans would reproduce. He continues to expound on this biological determinism, often in front of his lover at dinner parties, and seems to be unaware of the manner in which he is killing the lust in his relationship by continually referring to it through biological determinism rather than as a human experience that is extremely difficult to reduce to any one philosophical perspective.The encounter between Joe and Jed is a multi-dimensional encounter. One approach would be that Joe has encountered the very thing he has taught in his classroom, that sexual obsession is a driving biologically driven force that is beyond rational control in some situations. Yet, when Joe is actually confronted with the power of such a biologically driven obsessive attachment, he gradually becomes rattled and thrown off center emotionally. He becomes as mad as the mad man that has fallen so deeply in love with him. This first dimension would be rationality confronting determinism.Another approach would be the Jungian interpretation that Jeb represents Joe's dark shadow.  Joe preaches and teaches biological determinism because he wishes to be beyond its control, for after all, he is a professor of English romantic poetry. Teaching biological determinism gives him the illusion that he can control such forces. The appearance of Jeb proves him wrong. In Jungian psychology, the more the conscious mind tries to suppress the shadow, the creepier the shadow becomes as it stalks the ego, seeking acceptance. Thus the film could be interpreted as classic Jungian psychology. This second dimension would be the ego confronting the shadow.A third approach would be based on the ancient Greek concept of the Furies, those terrible tormenting images that follow the guilty around and plague them with feelings of guilt and remorse. Joe was one of the 4 men that let go of the red balloon. Whereas the pediatrician hung on and dies from the fall, if all had held on, the boy might have been saved.  Joe is tormented as to whether he let go of the balloon first, telling himself repeatedly that he was not the first to let go. The grief and remorse impact his judgment. Joe spends hours drawing balloons, cutting balloons out of magazines, and pinning balloon images up on his office bulletin board. Thus Jed is a Fury, a mythological creature come to haunt Joe's life for the sin of being the first to let go of the red balloon.These three interpretations are also interwoven with contemporary mental health concepts such as post-traumatic stress disorder, a diagnosis that Claire (Samantha Morton) offers to Joe.  The contemporary social phenomenon of the `stalker' is also evident. Jed could be seen as a stalker of Joe. The observation that all of these interpretations are interwoven into this film's narrative is part of the film's strength.Rhys Ifans is excellent as Jed, revealing slowly and incrementally the extent of his insane obsession. As Jed becomes more blatantly confrontive and Joe becomes more threatened, those around him don't fully understand the external and internal drama that Joe is encountering.I watched the film with a friend who decided to stop watching after the first hour. He said, ""This is a film about people arguing."" At some level he is correct. This is not an action film and the words and actions of all characters are ambivalent and ambiguous. But this makes it a rich tapestry of possibility and interpretation.",4,"An ambitious, ambivalent, ambiguous tapestry of a film",1258156800,"11 14, 2009",2009,4713,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'excellent', 'book', 'Enduring', 'Love', 'Ian', 'McEwan', 'very', 'good', 'filmed', 'version', 'are', 'two', 'distinct', 'works', 'art', 'enough', 'divergence', 'emphasis', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'compared', 'other', 'strongly', 'suggest', 'book', 'film', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'analyzed', 'separately', 'were', 'modifications', 'adaptations', 'made', 'script-writing', 'process', 'film', 'unique', 'stand', 'alone', 'product', 'not', 'just', 'film', 'excellent', 'book.The', 'pace', 'film', 'interesting', 'noteworthy', 'how', 'everyday', 'people', 'everyday', 'life', 'respond', 'unexpected', 'tragic', 'emotionally', 'disturbing', 'situations', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'excellent', 'college', 'professor', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'sculptress', 'lover', 'are', 'masterful', 'actors', 'who', 'bring', 'sense', 'reality', 'odd', 'situations', 'encounter', 'film.A', 'terrible', 'accident', 'tragedy', 'film', 'Joe', 'played', 'Craig', 'first', 'contact', 'Jed', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'dark', 'tormentor', 'Joe', 'adopted', 'biological', 'deterministic', 'view', 'sexual', 'relationships', 'love', 'love', 'making', 'college', 'class', 'English', 'romantic', 'poetry', 'Thus', 'romantic', 'love', 'purely', 'biologically', 'driven', 'impulse', 'created', 'so', 'humans', 'would', 'reproduce', 'expound', 'biological', 'determinism', 'often', 'front', 'lover', 'dinner', 'parties', 'be', 'unaware', 'manner', 'killing', 'lust', 'relationship', 'continually', 'referring', 'biological', 'determinism', 'rather', 'human', 'experience', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'reduce', 'one', 'philosophical', 'perspective.The', 'encounter', 'Joe', 'Jed', 'multi-dimensional', 'encounter', 'One', 'approach', 'would', 'be', 'Joe', 'encountered', 'very', 'thing', 'taught', 'classroom', 'sexual', 'obsession', 'driving', 'biologically', 'driven', 'force', 'rational', 'control', 'situations', 'when', 'Joe', 'actually', 'confronted', 'power', 'biologically', 'driven', 'obsessive', 'attachment', 'gradually', 'rattled', 'thrown', 'off', 'center', 'emotionally', 'as', 'mad', 'mad', 'man', 'fallen', 'so', 'deeply', 'love', 'first', 'dimension', 'would', 'be', 'rationality', 'confronting', 'determinism.Another', 'approach', 'would', 'be', 'Jungian', 'interpretation', 'Jeb', 'Joe', 'dark', 'shadow', 'Joe', 'preaches', 'teaches', 'biological', 'determinism', 'be', 'control', 'professor', 'English', 'romantic', 'poetry', 'Teaching', 'biological', 'determinism', 'illusion', 'can', 'control', 'such', 'forces', 'appearance', 'Jeb', 'wrong', 'Jungian', 'psychology', 'more', 'conscious', 'mind', 'tries', 'suppress', 'shadow', 'creepier', 'shadow', 'ego', 'seeking', 'acceptance', 'Thus', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'interpreted', 'classic', 'Jungian', 'psychology', 'second', 'dimension', 'would', 'be', 'ego', 'confronting', 'shadow.A', 'third', 'approach', 'would', 'be', 'based', 'ancient', 'Greek', 'concept', 'Furies', 'terrible', 'tormenting', 'images', 'follow', 'guilty', 'plague', 'feelings', 'guilt', 'remorse', 'Joe', 'was', 'one', '4', 'men', 'let', 'go', 'red', 'balloon', 'pediatrician', 'hung', 'dies', 'fall', 'had', 'held', 'boy', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'saved', 'Joe', 'tormented', 'let', 'go', 'balloon', 'first', 'telling', 'repeatedly', 'was', 'not', 'first', 'let', 'go', 'grief', 'remorse', 'impact', 'judgment', 'Joe', 'hours', 'drawing', 'balloons', 'cutting', 'balloons', 'magazines', 'pinning', 'balloon', 'images', 'up', 'office', 'bulletin', 'board', 'Thus', 'Jed', 'Fury', 'mythological', 'creature', 'come', 'haunt', 'Joe', 'life', 'sin', 'being', 'first', 'let', 'go', 'red', 'balloon.These', 'three', 'interpretations', 'are', 'also', 'interwoven', 'contemporary', 'mental', 'health', 'concepts', 'such', 'post-traumatic', 'stress', 'disorder', 'diagnosis', 'Claire', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'Joe', 'contemporary', 'social', 'phenomenon', 'stalker', 'also', 'evident', 'Jed', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'stalker', 'Joe', 'observation', 'interpretations', 'are', 'interwoven', 'film', 'narrative', 'part', 'film', 'strength.Rhys', 'Ifans', 'excellent', 'Jed', 'revealing', 'slowly', 'incrementally', 'extent', 'insane', 'obsession', 'Jed', 'more', 'blatantly', 'confrontive', 'Joe', 'more', 'threatened', 'do', ""n't"", 'fully', 'understand', 'external', 'internal', 'drama', 'Joe', 'encountering.I', 'watched', 'film', 'friend', 'who', 'decided', 'stop', 'watching', 'first', 'hour', 'said', 'film', 'people', 'arguing', 'level', 'correct', 'not', 'action', 'film', 'words', 'actions', 'characters', 'are', 'ambivalent', 'ambiguous', 'rich', 'tapestry', 'possibility', 'interpretation']",Enduring Love

The acting is first rate, but the storyline meanders with several subplots concerning the man who died, the family he left behind and whether or not he was with someone who fled the scene when he died. The viewer may be left wondering, what really happened? This film reminds me of the original version of the film Blowup, with its trick of the eye mystery.The synopsis says that the character who later becomes the stalker was the pilot of the air balloon, but if that was true, then what was his relationship with the boy in the balloon's basket? And why didn't Joe, who spent countless hours visiting the wife of the dead man and researching the causes of obsession, try to get information from the boy?In spite of an uneven plot and an ending that still leaves one wondering exactly what happened, the movie is unique and worth viewing.",4,You Can't Turn Away,1131321600,"11 7, 2005",2005,1064,"['Watching', 'film', 'bit', 'driving', 'slowly', 'accident', 'as', 'disturbing', 'see', 'destruction', 'ca', ""n't"", 'turn', 'away', 'everyone', 'else', 'said', 'opening', 'scene', 'exciting', 'pulls', 'story', 'acting', 'first', 'rate', 'storyline', 'meanders', 'several', 'subplots', 'concerning', 'man', 'who', 'died', 'family', 'left', 'behind', 'not', 'was', 'someone', 'who', 'fled', 'scene', 'when', 'died', 'viewer', 'may', 'be', 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'film', 'original', 'version', 'film', 'Blowup', 'trick', 'eye', 'mystery.The', 'synopsis', 'character', 'who', 'later', 'stalker', 'was', 'pilot', 'air', 'balloon', 'was', 'true', 'then', 'what', 'was', 'relationship', 'boy', 'balloon', 'basket', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Joe', 'who', 'spent', 'countless', 'hours', 'visiting', 'wife', 'dead', 'man', 'researching', 'causes', 'obsession', 'try', 'get', 'information', 'boy', 'spite', 'uneven', 'plot', 'ending', 'still', 'one', 'wondering', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'movie', 'unique', 'worth', 'viewing']",Enduring Love

I scroll down through the ratings and shake my head at how unaffected the average moviegoer is by some of the most spectacular pictures.  People expect them all to follow a familiar path like they're somehow comforted by the impending predictability and lack of motivation to think.  If that pretty well sums up your preferred cinematic experience, than this film is not for you.  It strikes a deep and personal chord on a level that most would just as soon shrug off and badmouth instead of embrace and allow themselves to be moved by.  Of all the thrillers released in the past few years, I can honestly say that Enduring Love is by far one of the most innovative and expertly conceived in a long time.Don't be thrown by the title, as this is not a love story by any traditional standards.  Rather it is the study of one man's descent into a bog of guilt and turmoil when he is unable to save the life of another man in a bizarre hot-air ballooning accident.  The true horror begins when one of the other witnesses becomes fixated on him, believing that the two shared some kind of spiritual exchange at the scene of the accident and won't let him forget it.  What first appears to be an innocent need for closure quickly reveals itself as a frightening case of manic obsession.Genius director Roger Michell (Changing Lanes) once again proves his mastery in the art of storytelling.  Enduring Love is a dark and intense tale, with one of the best written scripts and some of the finest acting you'll ever see.  There are pieces of dialogue in this film that are so deeply personal, you'll feel that the movie is actually looking right at you.  There is one particular moment in which Daniel Craig is lying on his bed in disarray and his girlfriend Samantha Morton steps just inside their bedroom door and stops.  She speaks to him for only an instant, then turns and walks away.  What she says is so powerful, and what the scene captures so precisely, is how mortifying it is for a man who already feels hopelessly lost, to learn unequivocally that even the one he loves and is closest to simply does not understand him.  Nothing could make a man feel more alone.Rhys Ifans is genuinely terrifying as the very ill stalker.  As I watched his performance, I couldn't help but feel an awesome fear come over me.  To see how one human being can so thoroughly infiltrate the life of another made me feel truly unsafe.  These people are all so real, you won't be able to keep from caring about what happens to them.  That's something that most filmmakers simply cannot accomplish.  Though somewhat reminiscent of The Talented Mr. Ripley, Enduring Love will make you think, make you feel, and leave you stunned.

Perhaps, like Alexander, the prospect of more guy on guy action (here, restricted to a single squirm inducing, somewhat meretricious encounter) prevented it from taking off (oh, ho ho) , leaving it adrift (titter) amongst the competition. It was well attended at a matinee here in the UK, although poorly distributed, as usual.This is one of those insidious little numbers that plague you with flashbacks to even the most innocuous scenes (such as the estranged couple ribbing each other over an au-pair as they cross a road.)I haven't read the novel but by all accounts the more fanciful plot developments have been re-worked to produce a mostly credible and humane work. Although the original `Solaris' is my favourite film, the examination of love here never really resonated, I don't know where they were going with it, frankly. How various parties coped with a single binding traumatic event held more resonance, in this case, a failed rescue attempt. The kind of situations in life that you don't have a clue how to deal with, settling instead for living with them, bereft of final answers.One alienated individual who is already coping poorly with life, goes to extremes. Another who is superficially successful and part of society copes poorly for differing reasons. The wife of one participant who acted out of character, questions her marriage. The final scene is poignant, the Hitchcock elements rather over-played in the trailer.The director rather muddles through. The on coming up draft was rather thuddingly sign posted. Overall, the fractured and uncertain style rather works in the films favour, whether by accident or design.Poor Bill Nighy is once again the pawn on the chessboard played for light relief and is most welcome, nevertheless. Daniel Craig, rather amusingly described in a review of one of his other recent releases as having the ability to over-act even in a balaclava, rather does the same here, although not ruinously. Rhys Ifans, rather a limited actor, does the best here within his limitations and Samantha Morton, usually irritating, shines in meloncholy.A difficult film to review but I recommend grabbing the rope (chortle) and hitching a ride with `Enduring Love' before it vanishes over the horizon (helpless with mirth.)",3,A basket case?

888467,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0007R4TJ4,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","Ian McEwan's masterfully written novels capitalize on interior dialogues, tracing mental vagaries that reveal the workings of the mind.  While reading McEwan is a particular intellectual joy, transposing his tightly wrought stories to the screen would seem a daunting project.  Thanks to the fine screenplay by Joe Penhall and the sensitive, minimalist approach to directing of Roger Michell ENDURING LOVE bleeds into our visual fields as a more or less successful transformation.Joe (Daniel Craig), a professor of 'biology/philosophy' mix, and  Claire (Samantha Morton),  a sculptor, are in a long-standing relationship taht seems well grounded.  They are introduced sunning  on a picnic near Oxford when a red hot air balloon glides by and gradually begins a disastrous descent.  The pilot John Logan (Lee Sheward) is trapped by a rope, his son in the basket of the balloon is unable to respond to his cries to release the cord and the balloon takes off with John dangling.  Joe and two other men rush to help, grabbing the basket, when a mighty wind whooshes them upward while they dangle precariously from the basket.  The three men disengage and fall to safety leaving Logan trapped along with his son. Logan is lifted dangerously high and eventually falls to his death, the boy surviving in a simple landing of the balloon some miles away.The accident triggers the story: one of the helpers - Jed (Rhys Ifans)- on finding the mutilated body of Logan turns to Joe and pleads with Joe to pray: a connection or bond is formed in Jed's eyes.  That evening as Claire and Joe dine with their close friends Robin (Bill Nighy) and Rachel (Susan Lynch) Joe's guilt  and remorse over not saving Logan surface and despite support form Claire, Robin, and Rachel those feelings builds in intensity.  One of McEwan's signature 'arbitrary nightmares' begins when Jed begins trying to contact Joe, a schema which becomes a stalking: Jed is obsessed with Joe, constantly trying to have Joe admit to a profound love that started between the two of them at the moment of the accident.Joe is slowly sucked into Jed's obsession and this perseverating behavior becomes a distancing wedge between Joe and Claire.  Joe tries to assuage his guilt by visiting Logan's wife (Helen McRory) who introduces yet another circumstantial twist to the quagmire of the consequences of the accident.  How Joe and Claire spin away from each other is part of the delirium incited by Jed's incessant interference.  The final confrontation with all three involved  ends tensely and with bloodshed: Joe's perception of 'love' as a biological entity is challenged as he sees the impact of a single circumstance erode his life.The ending is weak (hence four stars as opposed to five) and sort of gasps for air in a disappointing 'anti-resolution.'  Each of the actors is strong, especially Craig, Morton, and Ifans, and while we may not empathize with their characters, there is much to admire from their skills.  The cinematography by Haris Zambarloukos  is extraordinary for both the glorious exteriors shots and for the production design sets by John Paul Kelly.  The musical score by Jeremy Sams is well motivated until the gushy mush that accompanies the end credits.  Michell's direction feels related to McEwan's novel and if the addition of visual extremes at times breaks away from his otherwise terse, minimalist approach, that is probably the need of creating a motion picture for audiences accustomed to gory details.  Doubtless there will be different responses from those who have read the book and those who have not, but that is part of the pleasure of seeing a novel become film.  It is all relative.

Here he plays Joe, a mild-mannered professor, whose placid domestic life with his girlfriend is disrupted by witnessing a freak accident.  Joe's marriage proposal is ruined when a hot-air balloon comes crashing into the field where he's picnicking with his girlfriend, causing a tragic death and setting in motion a bizarre chain of events.  Another man at the scene attempting to render aid becomes fixated on Joe and morphs into that most tenacious of creatures: the romantically-obsessed stalker.  In the aftermath of the accident, as Joe struggles with guilt over having not helped enough and the unwelcome attentions of his new admirer, his formerly happy life rapidly unravels.

888471,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B0007R4TJ4,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[36, 42]","Whenever I've heard anyone discuss ""Enduring Love,"" or read a review of it,  there's always a vivid description of the first scene involved. And, usually there's mention of how the film was a letdown - not 100% of the time, of course, but often enough to take note. And people don't just say, ""I didn't like this movie."" - plain and simple. They use the words ""letdown,"" and ""disappointment,"" as if they had been expecting so much more. I read Ian McEwan's excellent novel, upon which the movie was based, and was certainly curious to see what one of my favorite directors, Roger Michell, (""Persuasion""), had done to bring the literary work to life. I so hate being one of the crowd....but:It's a warm, windy summer day. There's a sunny meadow, surrounded by hedgerows - all green and earth tones. A couple, Joe, (Daniel Craig), and his girlfriend, Claire (Samantha Morton), are on a picnic. As he opens a bottle of ""posh"" champagne, she stares over his shoulder as a beautiful red-colored helium balloon floats by, low to the ground. Then there's a shout and it seems as if the balloon is out of control, tilting oddly, dragging. The beauty of the bright red contrasted against the pastoral greens and browns is suddenly gone. One feels jarred. Joe and Claire rush toward the balloon, as do four other men who seem to come from nowhere - laborers from nearby fields, people in a passing car. The men grab on to the balloon. The pilot catches his foot and hangs from the line. The only passenger, a boy, is too afraid to release the cord or jump out. The wind picks-up and the balloon ascends, the men still holding on. As it rises, all the men let go, all but one. He manages to hang on until it's too late to drop safely.In the span of those few moments everything changes for Joe. The accident plagues him. It has become a terrible intrusion into his once happy existence. Filled with guilt and remorse, thinking that a life could have been saved if he had somehow acted otherwise, his behavior and perceptions become distorted. He sketches hot air balloons, cuts out photos of them, blow up small balloons for models. Enough already!!  Joe doesn't understand what is happening to himself and refuses to seek help for post-traumatic stress, as live-in lover Claire suggests. His long-term relationship with her begins to deteriorate. And, oddly, one of the men who tried to help that day, one of the four strangers who attempted to weight down the red balloon, contacts Joe. Scruffy-looking Jed Parry, (Rhys Ifans), attaches himself to Joe and begins to demonstrate extremely obsessive behavior. Jed believes everything happens for a reason. He thinks the entire purpose of the balloon accident was for Joe and him to meet - that they're soul mates - connected in some deep, inevitable way. Is this a sexual attraction? Is Jed a religious zealot? He wanted to pray with Joe after the after the incident.Whatever else he might be, Jed is a stalker. On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the level of Glenn Close's character in ""Fatal Attraction,""  Jed is a perfect 10! He writes to Joe; shows up in his classroom; watches from the park across from Joe's and Claire's flat on sunny days and in downpours. At first Joe appears enraged, then sympathetic, but the psychology behind whatever is happening is obscure. What does Jed want? How far will he go to get it? And why in heaven's name doesn't Joe do something about it?? What does Joe want - what are his fantasies? Call the police, Joe?? Take a long vacation to Australia, New Zealand or Chile with Claire. How engaged is Joe in this warped relationship? It is never made clear. That's a problem.I think the movie's initial scene is mentioned so frequently because it is so visually striking, and emotionally charged - really outstanding and unsettling. Unfortunately, the film, like the balloon, goes off course after that brief glimpse of brilliance. Director Michell promises so much in the first few minutes and does not deliver. The actors are outstanding. I must give them credit for making the most of what they were given. So, why does the film never live up to its potential? There's too much ambiguity. You need to read the book to understand what's going on in the movie. Isn't it usually the other way around? Jed's repetitive activity, along with Joe's repetitive passivity, are boring. And Joe's failure to act, even his seeming lack of clarity of purpose during a most critical scene at the end, is the film's failure.At one point in ""Enduring Love,"" Jed, a real madman, bangs his head against a wall repeatedly. That's exactly how I felt at that same moment, as a viewer. It would have been so easy to stop - just turn off the DVD player. But I kept waiting for some redeeming factor, something enlightening to happen to make sense of it all. Never happened. And the denouement came with a whimper, not a bang. There is no way I can recommend this film, in all honesty - unless you rent it for the first scene and fast forward to some other moments of pertinence before clicking off the remote.

A man, a woman, a blanket on the grass, a bottle of champagne.Director Roger Michell's ""Enduring Love"" begins with these props. The cozy setup and even cozier title together recall the final shot of Michell's romantic comedy ""Notting Hill."" An unsuspecting viewer -- that is, anyone who does not know this film is based on a haunting novel by the keen and bracingly unsentimental writer Ian McEwan -- might settle in for more of the same.But before the man even can pop the champagne cork, ""Enduring Love"" abruptly changes its tune, going from light to dark in a jarring, dissonant moment.A red hot-air balloon appears in the distance, hurtling along the ground. A man on the outside of the basket desperately hangs on. A boy inside the basket, alone, cries.The man with the champagne sees it and runs to help; so do several other men. They catch the balloon, but a strong wind gusts, lifting the balloon and all of the men into the air. As it rises, the men lose their grip on the ropes and drop to the ground, one by one. But one man hangs on, and on, until he finally loses his grip and drops, too high now to survive the fall.This stunning opening scene sets up the plot of ""Enduring Love"" and also offers a sustaining metaphor for its themes. How long do we hang on to love? Past the point where a rational person would let go? Is love ever rational?And, of course, what is love? Joe (Daniel Craig), the man with the champagne, asks his university students this question, but he already has his own anti-romantic answer. He thinks love might be just a trick of evolution to spur reproduction. And life? ""Life is a meaningless Darwinian existence,"" he says, ""but humans struggle to give it meaning.""It can't be much fun to be this guy's girlfriend, and Claire (the incandescent Samantha Morton) has an even harder time after the balloon incident. The guilt-ridden Joe becomes obsessed with it, turning the events over and over, wondering if he was the first to let go.The balloon obsession turns into something weirder, and more dangerous, when one of the other men who let go that day turns up at his house. Jed (Rhys Ifans), the sort of unhinged religious zealot cartoonists draw carrying a sign reading ""The End Is Near,"" has developed a spiritual-sexual fixation on Joe. He thinks they're in love and that Joe just cannot admit it to himself.As Jed's creepy stalking intensifies, and Joe's life with Claire unravels, Michell ramps up the suspense, leading to a full-blown thriller finale. Like the opening, it's a stunner -- and even more so when you realize that Michell and the excellent cast have taken a dense, interior novel of ideas and made it into a cracking, edge-of-your-seat movie.",4,'Enduring Love' won't let go of hard questions,1101427200,"11 26, 2004",2004,2747,"['sunlit', 'summer', 'day', 'verdant', 'English', 'park', 'man', 'woman', 'blanket', 'grass', 'bottle', 'champagne.Director', 'Roger', 'Michell', 'Enduring', 'Love', 'props', 'cozy', 'setup', 'even', 'cozier', 'title', 'together', 'recall', 'final', 'shot', 'Michell', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'unsuspecting', 'viewer', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'know', 'film', 'based', 'haunting', 'novel', 'keen', 'bracingly', 'unsentimental', 'writer', 'Ian', 'McEwan', 'might', 'settle', 'more', 'same.But', 'man', 'even', 'can', 'pop', 'champagne', 'cork', 'Enduring', 'Love', 'abruptly', 'tune', 'going', 'light', 'dark', 'jarring', 'dissonant', 'moment.A', 'red', 'hot-air', 'balloon', 'distance', 'hurtling', 'ground', 'man', 'outside', 'basket', 'desperately', 'boy', 'basket', 'alone', 'cries.The', 'man', 'champagne', 'help', 'so', 'do', 'several', 'other', 'men', 'catch', 'balloon', 'strong', 'wind', 'gusts', 'lifting', 'balloon', 'men', 'air', 'men', 'lose', 'grip', 'ropes', 'drop', 'ground', 'one', 'one', 'one', 'man', 'finally', 'grip', 'drops', 'too', 'high', 'now', 'survive', 'fall.This', 'stunning', 'opening', 'scene', 'up', 'plot', 'Enduring', 'Love', 'also', 'sustaining', 'metaphor', 'themes', 'How', 'long', 'do', 'hang', 'love', 'point', 'where', 'rational', 'person', 'would', 'let', 'go', 'Is', 'ever', 'rational', 'course', 'what', 'love', 'Joe', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'man', 'champagne', 'university', 'students', 'question', 'already', 'own', 'anti-romantic', 'answer', 'love', 'might', 'be', 'just', 'trick', 'evolution', 'spur', 'reproduction', 'life', 'Life', 'meaningless', 'Darwinian', 'existence', 'humans', 'struggle', 'give', 'meaning', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'fun', 'be', 'guy', 'girlfriend', 'Claire', 'incandescent', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'even', 'harder', 'time', 'balloon', 'incident', 'guilt-ridden', 'Joe', 'becomes', 'obsessed', 'turning', 'events', 'wondering', 'was', 'first', 'let', 'go.The', 'balloon', 'obsession', 'something', 'weirder', 'more', 'dangerous', 'when', 'one', 'other', 'men', 'who', 'let', 'go', 'day', 'up', 'house', 'Jed', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'sort', 'unhinged', 'religious', 'zealot', 'cartoonists', 'draw', 'carrying', 'sign', 'reading', 'End', 'Near', 'developed', 'spiritual-sexual', 'fixation', 'Joe', ""'re"", 'love', 'Joe', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'admit', 'himself.As', 'Jed', 'creepy', 'stalking', 'intensifies', 'Joe', 'life', 'Claire', 'unravels', 'Michell', 'up', 'suspense', 'leading', 'full-blown', 'thriller', 'finale', 'opening', 'stunner', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'when', 'realize', 'Michell', 'excellent', 'cast', 'have', 'taken', 'dense', 'interior', 'novel', 'ideas', 'made', 'cracking', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'movie']",Enduring Love

An old man tumbles out as a boy remains trapped inside.  The man desperately tugs on the rope attached to the basket in the hopes of keeping the boy close to the ground.  Joe runs to help him along with several other people.  All of them valiantly try to keep the balloon down and they are close to succeeding until a gust of wind lifts the balloon up higher and higher.  All of the men hold desperately on until Joe looks down and realizes he has to let go or risk serious injury.  The others start dropping shortly after Joe does, except for one man.  This man holds on, refusing to give up.  Everyone watches in horror as the inevitable happens.  Joe tells the crowd that they should go find him but only one man, named Jed, follows him.  They come upon the fallen man who is sitting up.  They run closer in amazement until the truth reveals itself.  It is an extremely haunting visual.After this dramatic opening scene, the movie is much slower paced.  It dwells and revels in the gut wrenching emotional wreckage left by this incident on those involved.  This crawling pace only adds to the creepiness that awaits us.The experience haunts Joe and messes with his head.  He replays it and recalculates over and over again, obsessively, and starts to withdraw.  He cannot get over the fact that a doctor with a wife and small child put his own life at stake for a complete stranger.  Joe digs into the man's life looking for answers but does not find any resolution.Cue the reappearance of Jed.  He wants to meet with Joe to talk things over.  Despite inner bells ringing over Jed's demeanor, he agrees.  Joe wants to reconnect with someone who shared the same experience but soon realizes how loopy Jed is and walks away after a very awkward conversation.  But this is not the end by a long shot as things get more and more unsettling.  Jed has mistakenly taken the intense emotion he feels from the shared incident as ""love"" for Joe and takes stalking very seriously.  At first, I didn't understand why Joe would put up with it.  Why not just call the police or something?  But Joe suffers from terrible guilt over being the first man to let go and give up on the rescue attempt.  These two random people have a bond that was formed by their intense experience and this bond is not so easily shaken when stirred with guilt.I recommend this movie for when a viewer is in the mood for something heavy.

Craig and some others rush to go help as they are lifted up in the air. But then Craig and some others let go but one man remains. The man eventually slips off and falls to his death (we see a gruesome scene of him sitting up and all of that). Rhys Ifans (Danny Deckchair, Little Nicky) plays Jed who was also at the scene, him and Craig share a little prayer. Much later Ifans starts to pop out of nowhere, stalking Craig, following him around when he has lunch with a friend, going where he goes and that sort of thing. The ballooning incident and Ifans scratches at Craig tearing into his great relationship with Morton making it hard for her. Craig is always good despite some roles he has done in his past, but here he shows he can go the distance with such a spiraling down character, I mean he doesnt spiral, sometimes but he eventually gets back up on his feet in the end and everything is alright. Ifans is the quiet creepy until towards the end where he says he ""loves"" Craig and yeah, what do you expect from a creepy stalker guy (hanging pictures of yourself on his wall, plus your girlfriends eyes cut out in a picture...of course!) Morton does an excellent job here to as she tries to love him and I jumped out of my seat at the end where Ifans visits Morton and Craig rushes over and it had the realistic feel to it, I wasnt expecting Ifans to do that to her. But when it went into slow motion after Ifans did that it wasnt effective, kinda disappointing. Also starring the always wonderful Bill Nighy (Constant Gardener, Underworld 1 + 2) and Andrew Lincoln (Love Actually).",3,Daniel Craig gets stalked by Rhys Ifans in Enduring Love,1138838400,"02 2, 2006",2006,1873,"['Joe', 'played', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Layer', 'Cake', 'Munich', 'picnicking', 'girlfriend', 'Claire', 'played', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'America', 'Minority', 'Report', 'out', 'open', 'field', 'suddenly', 'red', 'hot', 'air', 'balloon', 'nowhere', 'someone', 'trying', 'help', 'little', 'boy', 'Craig', 'others', 'rush', 'go', 'help', 'are', 'lifted', 'up', 'air', 'then', 'Craig', 'others', 'let', 'go', 'one', 'man', 'man', 'eventually', 'death', 'see', 'gruesome', 'scene', 'sitting', 'up', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'Danny', 'Deckchair', 'Little', 'Nicky', 'Jed', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'scene', 'Craig', 'share', 'little', 'prayer', 'Much', 'later', 'Ifans', 'pop', 'nowhere', 'stalking', 'Craig', 'following', 'around', 'when', 'lunch', 'friend', 'going', 'where', 'sort', 'thing', 'ballooning', 'incident', 'Ifans', 'scratches', 'Craig', 'tearing', 'great', 'relationship', 'Morton', 'making', 'hard', 'Craig', 'always', 'good', 'roles', 'done', 'past', 'here', 'can', 'go', 'distance', 'spiraling', 'down', 'character', 'mean', 'spiral', 'sometimes', 'eventually', 'back', 'up', 'feet', 'end', 'everything', 'alright', 'Ifans', 'quiet', 'creepy', 'end', 'where', 'loves', 'Craig', 'yeah', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'creepy', 'stalker', 'guy', 'hanging', 'pictures', 'wall', 'girlfriends', 'eyes', 'cut', 'out', 'picture', 'course', 'Morton', 'excellent', 'job', 'here', 'love', 'jumped', 'seat', 'end', 'where', 'Ifans', 'Morton', 'Craig', 'rushes', 'had', 'realistic', 'feel', 'wasnt', 'expecting', 'Ifans', 'do', 'when', 'went', 'slow', 'motion', 'Ifans', 'did', 'wasnt', 'effective', 'kinda', 'disappointing', 'Also', 'starring', 'always', 'wonderful', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'Constant', 'Gardener', 'Underworld', '1', '+', '2', 'Andrew', 'Lincoln', 'Love', 'Actually']",Enduring Love
888477,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0007R4TJ4,mirasreviews,"[3, 5]","""Enduring Love"" is a combination psychological thriller, character drama, and exploration of the nature of love adapted from the novel by Ian McEwan. It would have been better off concentrating on one of those things. College professor Joe (Daniel Craig) and sculptress girlfriend Claire (Samantha Morton) are picnicking in a tranquil meadow when a hot air balloon with 2 passengers crash-lands nearby. A man is thrown from the basket, but his young son is still inside as the balloon threatens to take off again. Joe, Claire, and several bystanders rush to hold the balloon down. With some difficulty they seem to have succeeded, when a gust of wind launches the balloon into the air again with the men still hanging on. Most of them let go of the balloon before it's too late, but one man holds on and falls to his death shortly thereafter. Joe becomes preoccupied -if not obsessed- with the incident and blames himself for the man's death. Another man who tried to help with the balloon, Jed (Rhys Ifans), finds another meaning entirely in the balloon incident and begins to stalk Joe.I don't know if this film's title was intended to imply ""love that endures"" or ""suffering on account of love"". Either idea would be suitable. ""Enduring Love"" might have been all right if it were simply a story about a delusional stalker preying on a man who initially indulges him out of a misplaced sense of guilt. Rhys Ifans' Jed is a genuinely creepy character. Unfortunately, Joe is an insufferably neurotic character himself who spends much of his time -and ours- desperately trying to find meaning in life's events while denying that they have any. He turns out to be as dysfunctional as his stalker. I don't buy his bizarre preoccupation with the balloon incident, his failure to understand his stalker's motives, or his reluctance to simply call the police, either. This is too bad, because Daniel Craig and Rhys Ifans generate a lot of palpable tension, and the conflict between the meaning that Jed sees in the balloon incident and the meaning that Joe so desperately wants to find is interesting. But both characters are repulsive, and there is only an hour's worth of material in this hour-and-35-minute film. Even the performances can't make ""Enduring Love"" worth sitting through, because it's just a film about someone's neurosis.

888480,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0007R4TJ4,RMurray847,"[4, 10]","My wife and I went to this movie based on several glowing reviews we read from movie critics.  We're fairly adventurous movie-goers...we frequent the ""art house"" as often as the multiplex.  We like a wide variety.  We like comedy, drama, romance, sci-fi, action, low-budget, blockbuster, etc. etc.  We did not, however, like ENDURING LOVE.  Not a bit.To be fair, the first 15 minutes or so are VERY good.  We see a young couple in a beautiful, seemingly empty meadow (Daniel Craig and Samantha Morton).  He's about to propose to her, when suddenly, there appears in the air a hot air balloon in trouble.  (We live in Albuquerque, NM, home of the Annual International Balloon Festival...so we know about balloons in trouble.)  Anyway, several people converge on the balloon, trying to help it down, but one of the passengers is hanging on to the tether, and instead of dropping from it from a safe height, he clings to it for dear life.  The balloon goes higher and higher, and his grip eventually gives out, and he plummets to a very convincing and gory death.  We truly feel like we have walked into a real-life, real-time personal tragedy.  There's no musical soundtrack, just the sounds of nature and the pants and groans and cussing and panic of normal looking people caught up in a brief, extraordinary event.  WOW!  I was ready for something great at this point.  Instead, I wish I'd left the theater.Rhys Ifans plays one of the witnesses to the event.  He and Craig are the two men who actually go to the body of the victim and share a moment of horror and disbelief.  Ifans believes they have shared more...a spiritual bonding of their souls.  An exchange of love that goes beyond this world.  In other words, he becomes a stalker.If we buy this huge, insane leap (and heck, we buy crazier things in movies all the time), then we should be on the path to an interesting twist to the stalker movie.  But instead, we are ""treated"" to scene after scene in which Ifans acts crazy, looks dewy-eyed at Craig and insists they have a bond.  Craig looks about the same level of ticked off in each scene.  Samantha Morton, a usually great actress, is unsympathetic in all respects.  After a series of boring confrontations, the film builds to a quick, bloody and uninteresting climax.The three stars have all turned in great performances in the past.  But somehow, they just go a little aboveboard here.  The director clearly doesn't have the tone of the film (other than the great opening) down.  He wants the film to be a ""serious"" psycho-killer movie.  I haven't read the book, but in the movie, this idea just doesn't work.  I'm not sure it ever could.  But it's too slight a story to be turned into a successful ""slasher flick"" either.  It's the movie equivalent of a good short story being forced to become a full-length novel.  Too many scenes feel unneeded, but if you cut them, you'd  have a 40 minute film.Anyway, I admire the understated skill of the opening sequence, but not much else.  Based on the fact that my wife and I both struggled to stay awake...I cannot recommend this movie to anyone.",2,Great start totally ruined,1114128000,"04 22, 2005",2005,3106,"['wife', 'went', 'movie', 'based', 'several', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'read', 'movie', 'critics', ""'re"", 'fairly', 'adventurous', 'movie-goers', 'frequent', 'art', 'house', 'as', 'often', 'multiplex', 'like', 'wide', 'variety', 'comedy', 'drama', 'romance', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'low-budget', 'blockbuster', 'etc', 'etc', 'did', 'not', 'however', 'ENDURING', 'LOVE', 'Not', 'bit.To', 'be', 'fair', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'so', 'are', 'VERY', 'good', 'see', 'young', 'couple', 'beautiful', 'seemingly', 'empty', 'meadow', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'propose', 'when', 'suddenly', 'air', 'hot', 'air', 'balloon', 'trouble', 'live', 'Albuquerque', 'NM', 'home', 'Annual', 'International', 'Balloon', 'Festival', 'so', 'know', 'balloons', 'trouble', 'Anyway', 'several', 'people', 'converge', 'balloon', 'trying', 'help', 'down', 'one', 'passengers', 'hanging', 'tether', 'instead', 'dropping', 'safe', 'height', 'dear', 'life', 'balloon', 'higher', 'higher', 'grip', 'eventually', 'out', 'very', 'convincing', 'gory', 'death', 'truly', 'feel', 'have', 'walked', 'real-life', 'real-time', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'musical', 'soundtrack', 'just', 'sounds', 'nature', 'pants', 'groans', 'cussing', 'panic', 'normal', 'looking', 'people', 'caught', 'up', 'brief', 'extraordinary', 'event', 'WOW', 'was', 'ready', 'something', 'great', 'point', 'Instead', 'wish', ""'d"", 'left', 'theater.Rhys', 'Ifans', 'one', 'witnesses', 'event', 'Craig', 'are', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'actually', 'go', 'body', 'victim', 'share', 'moment', 'horror', 'disbelief', 'Ifans', 'have', 'shared', 'more', 'spiritual', 'bonding', 'souls', 'exchange', 'love', 'world', 'other', 'words', 'stalker.If', 'buy', 'huge', 'insane', 'leap', 'heck', 'buy', 'crazier', 'things', 'movies', 'time', 'then', 'should', 'be', 'path', 'interesting', 'twist', 'stalker', 'movie', 'instead', 'are', 'treated', 'scene', 'scene', 'Ifans', 'crazy', 'dewy-eyed', 'Craig', 'have', 'bond', 'Craig', 'same', 'level', 'ticked', 'off', 'scene', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'usually', 'great', 'actress', 'unsympathetic', 'respects', 'series', 'boring', 'confrontations', 'film', 'quick', 'bloody', 'uninteresting', 'climax.The', 'three', 'stars', 'have', 'turned', 'great', 'performances', 'past', 'somehow', 'just', 'go', 'little', 'aboveboard', 'here', 'director', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'have', 'tone', 'film', 'other', 'great', 'opening', 'down', 'film', 'be', 'serious', 'psycho-killer', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'idea', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'ever', 'could', 'too', 'slight', 'story', 'be', 'turned', 'successful', 'slasher', 'flick', 'movie', 'equivalent', 'good', 'short', 'story', 'being', 'forced', 'become', 'full-length', 'novel', 'Too', 'many', 'scenes', 'feel', 'unneeded', 'cut', ""'d"", 'have', '40', 'minute', 'film.Anyway', 'admire', 'understated', 'skill', 'opening', 'sequence', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'Based', 'fact', 'wife', 'struggled', 'stay', 'awake', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone']",Enduring Love

888483,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0007R4TJ4,Tsuyoshi,"[7, 7]","This is what you find in Roger Michell's `Enduring Love', filmed adaptation of Booker Prize winner Ian McEwan. 1), excellent acting from Daniel Craig (going to be the next James Bond). 2) The film's brilliantly constructed opening sequence. But you need to stop questioning about so many plot holes and incomprehensible and illogical behaviors from the protagonist, Joe, an academic living with a girlfriend.After being involved in a suddne and terrible accident (of what, you may not believe, but it's a big balloon) which happened in the beautiful suburb of Oxford, Joe (Daniel Craig), university professor, starts to think about the possibility that something could have been done by him. While his girlfriend, sculptor Claire (Samantha Morton), perhaps rightly, thinks that Joe is thinking too much about his `guilt,' a stranger Joe met at the accident scene suddenly calls him.He is Jed (Rhys Ifans), to whom the accident is more than an accident. To Jed, it is a divine power that made the two of them meet each other. With a fixed idea that gets clearer to Joe and us as the story goes on, Joe, now alienated from Claire, is driven to the edge of madness ... or is this madness after all?Now, here is a simple question. You find a guy, who keeps showing up wherever you go; who stands outside your house even in the rain; who says something unsettling. And you have a kind, understanding friend by your side, and that friend happens to be Samantha Morton. What would you do? Listen to the guy? Or call the police? Simple question, isn't it?Very slick editing and clever use of color notwithstanding, we are only puzzled, being unable to accept the logics of the story. We know too well that it is Joe who makes things complicated, doing what a normal person would not do. Even his sympathetic friends (played by Bill Nighy and Susan Lynch, both good) fail to persuade him to do what he should do, then, so what can we do?To keep watching the mental journey of Joe is not without intriguing moments, thanks to Daniel Craig's credible acting. I am ready to admit that his acting talent is considerable. But the problem is his character. He doesn't seem to realize long enough the motive of this weird stranger, which is too obvious to us, and I couldn't understand why Joe misses every opportunity to do the right thing while he can continue making elaborate theories about love and relation. If Roger Michell and the filmmakers think that audiences can relate to the tormented teacher, they are utterly mistaken. On book, characters can keep thinking on and on in their brain, using words, words, words, even exchanging words and doing illogical discussions with imaginary friends. On film, they look either silly or boring. Or both, like this film.If I remember correctly, similar things happened in `The Comfort of Strangers' which is also based on another McEwan novel. Probably you see the film in a different way, but I couldn't finally bring myself to share the viewpoint of Joe, despite the superb acting of all the players, good images, and first-rate editing. `Enduring Love' is not a bad film; only it's a bad thriller, or a decent film with a bad thriller format.

888485,A31D8QKJXU93BT,B0007R4TJ4,"Vince Perrin ""Byline""","[0, 0]","Roger Michell, adapting Ian McEwan's novel, has directed three of the actors he used in the comedy ""Notting Hill"" in a disturbing film of psychological depth and daring, a movie for mature people who read books and hold conversations. Thus three quarters of DVD viewers will not have read ""Enduring Love"" and most certainly not have seen it. That's probably for the best. This quiet thriller is not for them. It subjects its characters to intricately layered themes and simply assumes we will understand them.One (Rhys Ifans) of the men who aids a floundering hot air balloonist, causing an accidental death, begins stalking another, convinced that their shared experience has sealed a loving bond. The object of his affection, a writer and professor (Daniel Craig), ignores him as the creep he clearly is. The professor himself feels guilty, due to the death, but gets no support from the shallow sculptor he loves (Samantha Morton); she dismisses his distress, intuits his trauma but can't abide it, and asks him to leave.That she also dismisses the danger is a source of satisfaction when she herself has a grim encounter with the stalker. Long before that, however, we have become increasingly apprehensive, held fast by the deliberate pace. The director may not be channeling Alfred Hitchcock but he certainly has seen ""Vertigo"" a few times. Michell's movie can be enjoyed as a thriller or a complex case study; indeed, at times it is impossible to separate the two.McEwan (who executive produced) has had three novels turned into film, starting with ""The Cement Garden"" and including ""The Comfort of Strangers"" and ""The Innocent,"" all with mixed artistic success  and small box office. A similar fate awaits ""Enduring Love,"" so faithful to the author's spirit and intent you almost can hear the pages turn. We must encourage producers who bring his peculiar but prize-winning books to the screen as well as they do. One hopes that ""Atonement"" is next.PS 7/31/06: ""Atonement"" is indeed next (with Kiera Knightly in the cast), and Craig has become the new James Bond.",4,"Up, Up and Away",1119225600,"06 20, 2005",2005,2071,"['Roger', 'Michell', 'adapting', 'Ian', 'McEwan', 'novel', 'directed', 'three', 'actors', 'used', 'comedy', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'disturbing', 'film', 'psychological', 'depth', 'daring', 'movie', 'mature', 'people', 'who', 'read', 'books', 'hold', 'conversations', 'Thus', 'three', 'quarters', 'DVD', 'viewers', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'read', 'Enduring', 'Love', 'most', 'certainly', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'probably', 'best', 'quiet', 'thriller', 'not', 'characters', 'intricately', 'layered', 'themes', 'simply', 'will', 'understand', 'them.One', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'men', 'who', 'aids', 'floundering', 'hot', 'air', 'balloonist', 'causing', 'accidental', 'death', 'stalking', 'convinced', 'shared', 'experience', 'sealed', 'loving', 'bond', 'object', 'affection', 'writer', 'professor', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'creep', 'clearly', 'professor', 'guilty', 'due', 'death', 'support', 'shallow', 'sculptor', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'distress', 'trauma', 'ca', ""n't"", 'abide', 'leave.That', 'also', 'danger', 'source', 'satisfaction', 'when', 'grim', 'encounter', 'stalker', 'Long', 'however', 'have', 'become', 'increasingly', 'apprehensive', 'held', 'fast', 'deliberate', 'pace', 'director', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'channeling', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'certainly', 'seen', 'Vertigo', 'few', 'times', 'Michell', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'thriller', 'complex', 'case', 'study', 'indeed', 'times', 'impossible', 'separate', 'two.McEwan', 'who', 'executive', 'produced', 'had', 'three', 'novels', 'turned', 'film', 'starting', 'Cement', 'Garden', 'including', 'Comfort', 'Strangers', 'Innocent', 'mixed', 'artistic', 'success', 'small', 'box', 'office', 'similar', 'fate', 'awaits', 'Enduring', 'Love', 'so', 'faithful', 'author', 'spirit', 'intent', 'almost', 'can', 'hear', 'pages', 'turn', 'must', 'encourage', 'producers', 'who', 'bring', 'peculiar', 'prize-winning', 'books', 'screen', 'as', 'well', 'do', 'One', 'Atonement', 'next.PS', '7/31/06', 'Atonement', 'indeed', 'next', 'Kiera', 'Knightly', 'cast', 'Craig', 'become', 'new', 'James', 'Bond']",Enduring Love
