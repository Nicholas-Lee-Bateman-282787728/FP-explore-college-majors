934765,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,B000AYEIJU,J. B. Hoyos,"[0, 0]","This review is for the Image release of ""Afraid of the Dark,"" a very bizarre and twisted film of psychological horror.  I may have enjoyed the film more if Image had provided English subtitles for the hearing impaired.  Though the picture quality was excellent (presented in its 1.66:1 theatrical aspect ratio), the audio was weak; I had difficulty understanding what some of the British stars were saying.  On numerous occasions, the child, Lucas, spoke barely above a whisper.  Furthermore, Image didn't provide a trailer or any commentary.""Afraid of the Dark"" is very creepy, with strong gothic elements.  The strange little boy, Lucas, lives next to a fog-enshrouded cemetery where much of the action takes place.  What begins as a slasher thriller in the vein of an Italian giallo becomes a tragic study in psychological horror; the viewer learns that one of the main characters is mentally disturbed and on the verge of committing murder.  Their fear of being forever trapped in darkness has driven them to the brink of insanity.I was rather disappointed upon discovering that ""Afraid of the Dark"" was not a typical mystery.  I was also disappointed with the ending.  It was not shocking or horrifying in the least.  Instead of ending with a scream, it ended with a yawn.  I expected a truly terrifying ending like the one in ""The Other.""  However, there are some moments of genuine tension.  This film reminded me of the classic ""Wait Until Dark"" and ""See No Evil,"" which are far more superior in regards to blind women being terrorized.  This is a movie that you definitely want to rent before purchasing; a late night viewing is also recommended, unless you are afraid of the dark.",3,Afraid Of Being Trapped Forever In Darkness,1233273600,"01 30, 2009",2009,1690,"['review', 'Image', 'release', 'Afraid', 'Dark', 'very', 'bizarre', 'twisted', 'film', 'psychological', 'horror', 'may', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'more', 'Image', 'had', 'provided', 'English', 'subtitles', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'picture', 'quality', 'was', 'excellent', 'presented', '1.66:1', 'theatrical', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'audio', 'was', 'weak', 'had', 'difficulty', 'understanding', 'what', 'British', 'stars', 'were', 'saying', 'numerous', 'occasions', 'child', 'Lucas', 'spoke', 'barely', 'whisper', 'Furthermore', 'Image', 'did', ""n't"", 'provide', 'trailer', 'commentary', 'Afraid', 'Dark', 'very', 'creepy', 'strong', 'gothic', 'elements', 'strange', 'little', 'boy', 'Lucas', 'next', 'fog-enshrouded', 'cemetery', 'where', 'much', 'action', 'place', 'What', 'slasher', 'thriller', 'vein', 'Italian', 'giallo', 'tragic', 'study', 'psychological', 'horror', 'viewer', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'verge', 'committing', 'murder', 'fear', 'being', 'forever', 'trapped', 'darkness', 'driven', 'brink', 'insanity.I', 'was', 'rather', 'disappointed', 'discovering', 'Afraid', 'Dark', 'was', 'not', 'typical', 'mystery', 'was', 'also', 'disappointed', 'ending', 'was', 'not', 'shocking', 'horrifying', 'least', 'Instead', 'ending', 'scream', 'ended', 'yawn', 'expected', 'truly', 'terrifying', 'ending', 'one', 'Other', 'However', 'are', 'moments', 'genuine', 'tension', 'film', 'reminded', 'classic', 'Wait', 'Dark', 'See', 'Evil', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'superior', 'regards', 'blind', 'women', 'being', 'terrorized', 'movie', 'definitely', 'want', 'rent', 'purchasing', 'late', 'night', 'viewing', 'also', 'recommended', 'are', 'afraid', 'dark']",N/A

I was flicking through the channels looking for one of those scary movies that make you scream or turn on all the lights.  There was nothing on TV.  I came across this  movie and settled for it, even though I was not happy.  I didn't expect anything from *Afraid of the Dark* because I hadn't heard of it before.  However, this movie gradually got my attention and I enjoyed it.Here, you have a boy who seemed to live in a world where just about everyone is blind.  However, on the flip side, it's really the boy who is losing his vision.  Meanwhile, in the boy's mind, someone is killing blind people and he has to investigate who is doing the killing.  At the same time, in reality, the boy is largely ignored as the family prepares for the upcoming birth of his sister.  In addition, the boy is becoming violent but goes by unnoticed by others.Overall, a nice little suspense of a movie.",4,interesting Halloween movie,1194480000,"11 8, 2007",2007,922,"['saw', 'movie', 'Halloween', 'was', 'flicking', 'channels', 'looking', 'one', 'scary', 'movies', 'make', 'scream', 'turn', 'lights', 'was', 'nothing', 'TV', 'came', 'movie', 'settled', 'even', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', '*Afraid', 'Dark*', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'However', 'movie', 'gradually', 'got', 'attention', 'enjoyed', 'it.Here', 'have', 'boy', 'who', 'seemed', 'live', 'world', 'where', 'just', 'everyone', 'blind', 'However', 'flip', 'side', 'really', 'boy', 'who', 'losing', 'vision', 'Meanwhile', 'boy', 'mind', 'someone', 'killing', 'blind', 'people', 'investigate', 'who', 'doing', 'killing', 'same', 'time', 'reality', 'boy', 'largely', 'ignored', 'family', 'upcoming', 'birth', 'sister', 'addition', 'boy', 'becoming', 'violent', 'unnoticed', 'others.Overall', 'nice', 'little', 'suspense', 'movie']",N/A

934769,A1QVBWEO474XUV,B000AYEIJU,S. T. Patchin,"[0, 0]","This was a film with a great premise with a first half that showed amazing promise.Immediately we're told a slasher is targeting the blind and introduced to a strange boy and his sightless mother and rigid policeman father. Though uncertain who the criminal is we get the impression a young repairman working at a blind institute whistling ironic songs can't have good intentions. The parallel between killer and young protagonist is made early on with the boy covering alot of stalker ground: following a target home, toying with them, peeping on them, then breaking & entering.Right at about this point the movie begins to devolve. The rationality takes that of a nightmare and though mildly frightening it makes very little sense in the long run. Great lines about villians being ""all the same"" are lost in a plotless story. We're treated to truly great set-ups, the stand-out being a train station attack, and it's ultimately all in vain.But really it's not surprising. This seems more akin to Italian giallo than any other kind of thriller and those films, despite their ingenuity and ambition, are always incomplete.",3,Three Blind Mice,1132272000,"11 18, 2005",2005,1122,"['was', 'film', 'great', 'premise', 'first', 'half', 'showed', 'amazing', 'promise.Immediately', ""'re"", 'told', 'slasher', 'targeting', 'blind', 'introduced', 'strange', 'boy', 'sightless', 'mother', 'rigid', 'policeman', 'father', 'Though', 'uncertain', 'who', 'criminal', 'get', 'impression', 'young', 'repairman', 'working', 'blind', 'institute', 'whistling', 'ironic', 'songs', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'good', 'intentions', 'parallel', 'killer', 'young', 'protagonist', 'made', 'early', 'boy', 'covering', 'alot', 'stalker', 'ground', 'following', 'target', 'home', 'toying', 'peeping', 'then', 'breaking', 'entering.Right', 'point', 'movie', 'devolve', 'rationality', 'nightmare', 'mildly', 'frightening', 'very', 'little', 'sense', 'long', 'run', 'Great', 'lines', 'villians', 'being', 'same', 'are', 'lost', 'plotless', 'story', ""'re"", 'treated', 'truly', 'great', 'set-ups', 'stand-out', 'being', 'train', 'station', 'attack', 'ultimately', 'vain.But', 'really', 'not', 'surprising', 'more', 'akin', 'Italian', 'giallo', 'other', 'kind', 'thriller', 'films', 'ingenuity', 'ambition', 'are', 'always', 'incomplete']",N/A
