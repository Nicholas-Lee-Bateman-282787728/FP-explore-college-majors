The problem with this dvd is that the digital copyright protection prevents it from being played properly on computers or dvd/vcr combo machines.  It works fine on machines that contain only a dvd player.  I found this to be extremely frustrating and inconvenient.  I wound up with 2 dvd's and they both behaved in the same way.As a 12 year old, Holly Grant meets Santa and as she thinks she is too old for traditional gifts, she tells Santa she wants a boyfriend for Christmas.  He leaves a gift under her tree with a message:  she will receive her requested gift in the 20th year ""when two hearts are ready"".  Time then goes to almost 20 years later when Holly is in her 30's and is working for a non-profit organization.  Enter Ryan Hughes, a lawyer, who courtesy of Santa winds up being Holly's gift for Christmas.  A mistake with a joint client causes Ryan to have a falling out with Holly even though they've never met.  When Ryan arrives on Holly's doorstep, he chooses to tell Holly his name is Douglas Firwood to hide his true identity.  Over the holiday Holly and ""Doug"" fall in love as they hold up a charade with her family.  Holly's jealous ex-boyfriend tries to expose Ryan as a fraud, and Ryan's lie threatens to spoil his chance for a happy future with Holly. There is one brief comment about sex and a few uses of God's name, but otherwise I would say it is a great family movie.January 2009 - I just wanted to say that it seems they've fixed the problem.

I always recommend ""Straight from the heart"", with Teri Polo because it contains a sweet romance with a good story line and doesn't have to use scenes involving a sexual encounter to keep one's interest.  This movie, ""A boyfriend for Christmas"" contains one scene where the young woman asks her potential boyfriend his sexual preferences (he answers with a light response, and the subject is closed), and another where she calls him late one night, and asks him what he is wearing (another light response), but other than that, it is a decent romance story that has a nifty little surprise at the end that I didn't even guess at. This movie is definitely a keeper!Some of us women would appreciate more movies like the two above mentioned ones, that have a really great romance story without all the sex and profanity.

927086,A1O054IKH8831H,B000AJJMXM,"Valerie Milton ""Ladyvalerie""","[1, 1]","This was a cute romantic movie about a woman who wished as a pre-teen to have a boyfriend for Christmas. Twenty years later she's a little jaded and has given up hope. But will things turn around for her this Christmas? This reminded me a tiny bit of the Doris Day & Rock Hudson ""Mistaken Identity"" theme. The one thing about this movie that stood out to me was that half the time they showed the skyline for downtown L.A. yet there was snow on the ground. The other half of the time it was a totally different skyline. Wasn't that big a deal, but it was kinda funny. This movie was sweet and easy and the whole family can watch it. Charles Durning played a good Santa. A nice movie to get you into the Christmas mood.",3,Ladyvalerie,1168300800,"01 9, 2007",2007,718,"['was', 'cute', 'romantic', 'movie', 'woman', 'who', 'wished', 'pre-teen', 'have', 'boyfriend', 'Christmas', 'Twenty', 'years', 'later', 'little', 'jaded', 'given', 'up', 'hope', 'will', 'things', 'turn', 'around', 'Christmas', 'reminded', 'tiny', 'bit', 'Doris', 'Day', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'Mistaken', 'Identity', 'theme', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'stood', 'out', 'was', 'time', 'showed', 'skyline', 'downtown', 'L.A.', 'yet', 'was', 'snow', 'ground', 'other', 'half', 'time', 'was', 'totally', 'different', 'skyline', 'Was', ""n't"", 'that', 'big', 'deal', 'was', 'kinda', 'funny', 'movie', 'was', 'sweet', 'easy', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'Charles', 'Durning', 'played', 'good', 'Santa', 'A', 'nice', 'movie', 'get', 'Christmas', 'mood']",N/A
