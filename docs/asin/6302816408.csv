The movie-going world was still reeling from the impact of the previous year's offering of Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, and a  western comedy just didn't have the drawing power.If you take the time  to watch this show, however, you will find that it is a real treasure!A young student at a rabbical in Poland is enamured with the American  west.  When he graduates he is given the assignment of his dreams...to take  a copy of the Torah with him, sail to America, and lead the fledgling  Jewish community in the &quot;village of San Francisco.&quot;  Where is  that? he asks...&quot;By New York.&quot;The casting of Gene Wilder as  the young rabbi, and Harrison Ford as a rough and tumble, carrousing, card  playing, bank robber clicks.The gullible young rabbi is fleeced as soon  as he hits American soil, but he is still determined to recover what is  his, and to make the cross-country journey to California.  One thing leads  to another, and the rabbi and cowboy meet up.  The best parts of the movie  are the conversations the rabbi has with himself, as if he were teaching  himself.From mishap to misadventure, this is a real  &quot;keeper.&quot;I highly recommend this show...it rings authentic in  many respects, and has truly funny parts in it.  One of my favorite bits is  when the rabbi will not ride his horse until the end of the Sabbath, even  though there's a posse on their trail.  You'll see one perturbed Harrison  Ford in that scene.5 stars through and through.",5,"Even if you don't like westerns, you'll like this one!",959299200,"05 26, 2000",2000,1573,"['quot', 'Frisco', 'Kid', 'quot', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'box', 'office', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'movie-going', 'world', 'was', 'still', 'reeling', 'impact', 'previous', 'year', 'offering', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Empire', 'Strikes', 'Back', 'western', 'comedy', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'drawing', 'power.If', 'take', 'time', 'watch', 'show', 'however', 'will', 'find', 'real', 'treasure', 'young', 'student', 'rabbical', 'Poland', 'enamured', 'American', 'west', 'When', 'given', 'assignment', 'dreams', 'take', 'copy', 'Torah', 'sail', 'America', 'lead', 'fledgling', 'Jewish', 'community', 'quot', 'village', 'San', 'Francisco.', 'quot', 'Where', 'quot', 'New', 'York.', 'quot', 'casting', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'young', 'rabbi', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'rough', 'tumble', 'carrousing', 'card', 'playing', 'bank', 'robber', 'clicks.The', 'gullible', 'young', 'rabbi', 'fleeced', 'as', 'soon', 'American', 'soil', 'still', 'determined', 'recover', 'what', 'make', 'cross-country', 'journey', 'California', 'One', 'thing', 'rabbi', 'cowboy', 'meet', 'up', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'conversations', 'rabbi', 'were', 'teaching', 'himself.From', 'mishap', 'misadventure', 'real', 'quot', 'quot', 'highly', 'recommend', 'show', 'authentic', 'many', 'respects', 'truly', 'funny', 'parts', 'One', 'favorite', 'bits', 'when', 'rabbi', 'will', 'not', 'ride', 'horse', 'end', 'Sabbath', 'even', 'posse', 'trail', ""'ll"", 'see', 'one', 'perturbed', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'scene.5']",N/A

338737,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,6302816408,Chrijeff,"[2, 2]","Despite occasional slapstick and the kind of randy humor that's to be expected from a movie made in the '70's, this comedy-Western-drama (it changes focus as it nears its end) is one of my favorites (possibly because of a scruffy--if not nerf-herding--Harrison Ford, two years off his defining role as Han Solo inStar Wars Episode IV - A New Hope (1977 & 2004 Versions, 2-Disc Widescreen Edition)).  In the year 1850, a recently minted Polish rabbi, Avram Belinsky (Gene Wilder), dreams of going to America and encountering the Indians and Wild West types he's read about.  When his chief rabbi receives a request from a group of San Francisco Jews to send them a rabbi and a Torah, he gets his chance.  Of course, being a greenhorn, he's no sooner off the boat in Philadelphia than he falls afoul of the Diggs brothers (George Ralph DiCenzo, William Smith) and their accomplice Mr. Jones (Ramon Bieri), who rob him of his last penny and set him afoot in Lancaster County.  Eventually, thanks to a compassionate Amish community, he makes it as far as the Midwest, where he falls in with train-and-bank robber Tommy Lillard (Ford).  Tommy doesn't know a rabbi from a tomb-rubbing, but he certainly knows a tenderfoot when he sees one, and before long he's taken on the task of seeing Avram to the coast alive.  Bitter winter weather, Indians, and eventually confrontations with Jones and the Diggses test both men's resolve and serve as the glue that bonds them as best friends.  In the end Tommy must help Avram restore his lost belief in himself, and Avram must face Matt Diggs alone.The movie provides Ford with one of his most delightful roles (Tommy and Avram inspired a long cycle of fan fiction, most of it unfortunately OP), and despite his often very rough personality and language he makes a sympathetic character of the part.  (The novelization,Frisco Kid, will provide some background and help smooth out at least one rather glaring omission of exposition.)  Though the historical accuracy is sometimes questionable and the title slightly puzzling (at no time is either character called ""the Frisco Kid""), the central motifs of buddyship and determination make this a good movie for families with older kids.",4,A buddy film with a twist,1287360000,"10 18, 2010",2010,2219,"['occasional', 'slapstick', 'kind', 'randy', 'humor', 'be', 'expected', 'movie', 'made', ""'70"", 'comedy-Western-drama', 'focus', 'end', 'one', 'favorites', 'possibly', 'scruffy', 'not', 'nerf-herding', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'two', 'years', 'defining', 'role', 'Han', 'Solo', 'inStar', 'Wars', 'Episode', 'IV', 'New', 'Hope', '1977', '2004', 'Versions', '2-Disc', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'year', '1850', 'recently', 'minted', 'Polish', 'rabbi', 'Avram', 'Belinsky', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'dreams', 'going', 'America', 'encountering', 'Indians', 'Wild', 'West', 'read', 'When', 'chief', 'rabbi', 'request', 'group', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Jews', 'send', 'rabbi', 'Torah', 'chance', 'course', 'being', 'greenhorn', 'sooner', 'boat', 'Philadelphia', 'afoul', 'Diggs', 'brothers', 'George', 'Ralph', 'DiCenzo', 'William', 'Smith', 'accomplice', 'Mr.', 'Jones', 'Ramon', 'Bieri', 'who', 'rob', 'last', 'penny', 'set', 'afoot', 'Lancaster', 'County', 'Eventually', 'thanks', 'compassionate', 'Amish', 'community', 'as', 'far', 'Midwest', 'where', 'train-and-bank', 'robber', 'Tommy', 'Lillard', 'Ford', 'Tommy', ""n't"", 'know', 'rabbi', 'tomb-rubbing', 'certainly', 'tenderfoot', 'when', 'one', 'long', 'taken', 'task', 'seeing', 'Avram', 'coast', 'alive', 'Bitter', 'winter', 'weather', 'Indians', 'eventually', 'confrontations', 'Jones', 'Diggses', 'test', 'men', 'resolve', 'serve', 'glue', 'bonds', 'best', 'friends', 'end', 'Tommy', 'must', 'help', 'Avram', 'restore', 'lost', 'belief', 'Avram', 'must', 'face', 'Matt', 'Diggs', 'alone.The', 'movie', 'Ford', 'one', 'most', 'delightful', 'roles', 'Tommy', 'Avram', 'inspired', 'long', 'cycle', 'fan', 'fiction', 'most', 'unfortunately', 'OP', 'often', 'very', 'rough', 'personality', 'language', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'part', 'novelization', 'Frisco', 'Kid', 'will', 'provide', 'background', 'help', 'smooth', 'out', 'least', 'one', 'rather', 'glaring', 'omission', 'exposition', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'sometimes', 'questionable', 'title', 'slightly', 'puzzling', 'time', 'character', 'called', 'Frisco', 'Kid', 'central', 'motifs', 'buddyship', 'determination', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'families', 'older', 'kids']",N/A

Nothing in the film is historical, but the facts are that the first Rabbi was brought there in that decade when the town was very young and developing rapidly.Gene Wilder plays Avram Belinkski who is going the city on the Bay to become their Rabbi and to get a wife (part of his contract).  Along the way he meets up with Tommy Lillard (Harrison Ford in an early role).  Tommy is a scoundrel and that contrast with the Rabbi is part of the fun of the film.  When Tommy robs a bank leaving Avram holding the horses (and without, of course, telling Avram), they have to outrun a posse for days.  One of those days is the Sabbath and Avram won't ride his horse on the Sabbath to Tommy's consternation.They also get captured by some Indians - very civilized Indians - and while things start badly, they end well.  And, of course, they meet up with a tribe of very uncivilized white guys and it is the encounters with them that cause Avram his greatest crisis.It is a pleasant movie with some funny moments, some touching moments, and is a pleasant diversion.

338740,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6302816408,David Baldwin,"[2, 3]","Before I review this film I'd like to quibble with the photo on the DVD package.  It sports a large picture of Harrison Ford with star Gene Wilder obscured with a small picture of him in the left hand corner.  There's no denying the magnitude of Ford's popularity but, hey, this is Wilder's show and he is a respected actor in his own right.  Anyhow, this is a wonderful picture.  I absolutely love it.  It works on so many levels.  It works as a traditional western.  It's essentially a comic western in the veign of ""Destry Rides Again"" and not a parody of one like ""Blazing Saddles"" despite Wilder's presence.  As for Wilder, I could almost bet if he were to name one of his favorite characters he played he would say Avram Belinsky.  The film's establishing scenes in Poland give you the false impression that Avram is something of a buffoon.  When it transports to America Avram proves anything but.  For sure there is a childlike quality to him that's deceiving.  But Avram also proves to be a kindly, devout, and intensely moral man.  We root for Avram to succeed in the new and untamed land he has been called to serve as Rabbi.  As for Ford, he is winning as a goodhearted but misguided bankrobber who helps Avram probably as some form of redemption.

Harrison Ford, usually the main star who carries the movie, acts very well, but stands second in this film to Wilder, like a stright man.I recommend it highly.For those who do not know its plot: A San Francisco Jewish community beseeches the rabbis in Poland to send them a rabbi. Gene Wilder is selected and promised the daughter of the community leader as a wife; an arranged marriage, as was frequent in those days. Wilder knows nothing about American culture and is swindled and robbed. He no longer has money to take a train accross America, but must walk or ride a horse. He gets in troubles and is saved by Harrison Ford, a gunman and bank robber, who becomes his best friend, his only friend.

This is one of the rare movies that I can watch over and over and still enjoy.A big attraction has got to be the two stars Harrison Ford and Gene Wilder.  Ford plays a good-hearted rascal as well as anyone ever has.  Wilder was the master of the excessive, and to me irritating, comedic character often found in Mel Brooks movies.  But in this movie the director has Wilder play a more subdued and true everyman who is confronted by challenges yet still retains his humanity and optimistic world view.The plot centers around Wilder a Jewish rabbi in training in Poland.  The Jewish synagogue in 1849 era San Francisco sends for a rabbi for their growing congregation.  Wilder is a gentle doofus, a favorite of the children, but not the sharpest knife in the drawer and he is sent off to America sadly unprepared and unknowledgeable.  He is robbed and beaten and then makes his way from New York to San Francisco through the charity of various groups and through the help of a bank-robbing cowboy with a heart of gold who then guides him to San Francisco.Along the way, Wilder and then the two actors have encounters with Amish, Indians, cut-throats, and a monastic order.  Some of these scenes are hilarious.One of the themes that other reviewers leave out is how Wilder's character comes to appreciate America with its wide open spaces and open-hearted people that help Wilder out over and over.  Wilder frequently praises the people and the land as they help him on his journey and there is a patriotic goodness in this aspect of the film that is sadly lacking in many modern westerns that have substituted dirt and nastiness for the true characteristics of the western settler.The only drawback of this film that should be a family oriented movie is the language.  There is frequent profanity spread throughout the move so I wouldn't allow anyone younger than a teen to see the movie unless you can find it edited.  No nudity and no sex though there are frequent references to brothels etc.Overall, one of my favorite movies and one I have waited for years to come out on DVD since my VHS wore out.  4 stars.",4,Excellent comedic western and tribute to America,1263945600,"01 20, 2010",2010,2188,"['have', 'watched', 're-watched', 'movie', 'years', 'family', 'friends', 'one', 'rare', 'movies', 'can', 'watch', 'still', 'enjoy.A', 'big', 'attraction', 'got', 'be', 'two', 'stars', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'Ford', 'good-hearted', 'rascal', 'as', 'well', 'anyone', 'ever', 'Wilder', 'was', 'master', 'excessive', 'irritating', 'comedic', 'character', 'often', 'found', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'movies', 'movie', 'director', 'Wilder', 'play', 'more', 'subdued', 'true', 'everyman', 'who', 'confronted', 'challenges', 'yet', 'still', 'humanity', 'optimistic', 'world', 'view.The', 'plot', 'centers', 'Wilder', 'Jewish', 'rabbi', 'training', 'Poland', 'Jewish', 'synagogue', '1849', 'era', 'San', 'Francisco', 'rabbi', 'growing', 'congregation', 'Wilder', 'gentle', 'doofus', 'favorite', 'children', 'not', 'sharpest', 'knife', 'drawer', 'sent', 'off', 'America', 'sadly', 'unprepared', 'unknowledgeable', 'robbed', 'beaten', 'then', 'way', 'New', 'York', 'San', 'Francisco', 'charity', 'various', 'groups', 'help', 'bank-robbing', 'cowboy', 'heart', 'gold', 'who', 'then', 'San', 'Francisco.Along', 'way', 'Wilder', 'then', 'two', 'actors', 'have', 'encounters', 'Amish', 'Indians', 'cut-throats', 'monastic', 'order', 'scenes', 'are', 'hilarious.One', 'themes', 'other', 'reviewers', 'leave', 'out', 'how', 'Wilder', 'character', 'appreciate', 'America', 'wide', 'open', 'spaces', 'open-hearted', 'people', 'help', 'Wilder', 'out', 'over', 'Wilder', 'frequently', 'people', 'land', 'help', 'journey', 'patriotic', 'goodness', 'aspect', 'film', 'sadly', 'lacking', 'many', 'modern', 'westerns', 'have', 'substituted', 'dirt', 'nastiness', 'true', 'characteristics', 'western', 'settler.The', 'only', 'drawback', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'family', 'oriented', 'movie', 'language', 'frequent', 'profanity', 'spread', 'move', 'so', 'would', ""n't"", 'allow', 'anyone', 'younger', 'teen', 'see', 'movie', 'can', 'find', 'edited', 'nudity', 'sex', 'are', 'frequent', 'references', 'brothels', 'etc.Overall', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'one', 'have', 'waited', 'years', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'wore', 'out', '4', 'stars']",N/A

And when I found it was available on DVD (the version I first watched was an old VHS copy) I had to have it in my own library!My only complaint would be the cover art. Harrison Ford is shown rather prominently and Gene Wilder is almost an afterthought. The two should have had more equal representation, or if one person had to be given prominence it is more Wilder's movie then it is Ford's. Still, that is a complaint against the producers of the DVD (who likely saw Ford as the more marketable star to modern audiences) and not against the film itself, so I won't let it effect my rating.If you're looking for an entertaining, quality, classic comedy, this is a great film to watch.

Not &#34;great&#34; by anyone's standards, but Rabbi Belinski is a most sympathetic character - not portrayed (as I had feared) as a bumbling naf, but rather as an earnest yet somewhat gullible Man with a Mission: to bring the Torah to the American West. There were several outstanding episodes along the way of his odyssey. The encounter with the Amish farmers, the scene with the Indians where he shows himself willing to die in order to protect the Torah, and finally where Avram tells Tommy Lillard (Harrison Ford) that they are the best of friends (despite all their arguments along the way). But most of all, you really LIKE the people in this film (other than the Bad Guys, of course).Missteps along the way: the robbery on the train, the opening vignette in Poland, and the scene in the first Western town they come to (about which I can say nothing further without major spoilers).I also smiled at the barbed wire fences in many scenes. The movie is set in 1850, and barbed wire wasn't invented until 1873. And the roads that they travel down, although unpaved, are also clearly of 20th century vintage (way too smooth, with clean, straight-as-a-ruler shoulders).Among my favorite films?

I think I'd been aware of it for many years but wasn't especially interested. It's only since I've been attracted to films with Jewish themes that The Frisco Kid really caught my attention. I picked up a used copy through Goodwill via Amazon for a penny.Rabbi Avram Belinski (Gene Wilder), almost 87th in his yeshiva class of 88 students, is on his way to San Francisco to lead the congregation . . . and to marry. He meets with adversity and hardship along the way, but makes friends and is given a helping hand by wayward cowpoke Tom Lillard (Harrison Ford). Mr Lillard happens to rob banks for a living. He also knows how to traverse the land.Circumstances of their cross-country adventures are often whimsical or tender, and dreadfully silly at times. But despite it all, Rabbi Belinski takes in far more about life than he anticipated; and I'd like to think Cowboy Tom learns a bit along the way as well.This film pleases me. It contains significant and serious ideas wrapped by the familiarity of the Wild West and combines it with humor both subtle and absurd.

338791,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6302816408,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 2]","Sometimes it's not difficult to tell when a studio doesn't have much confidence in a film. Changing the title several times is usually one, and Robert Aldrich's kosher comedy Western went from The Ten Gallon Yamulka and No Knife to The Frisco Kid. The trailer's another dead giveaway: most of it is made up of footage of Gene Wilder from Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein and Silver Streak. Nor did it get much of a theatrical release and has kept a low profile on TV and video ever since (it's practically been unseen in the UK since 1980) despite co-starring Gene Wilder and a young Harrison Ford, still fresh off Star Wars, as a naive Polish rabbi headed to San Francisco and the outlaw he teams up with. It doesn't help that the film was at one point a John Wayne vehicle until they tried to get him to take a pay cut, especially since Ford lacked the star power at that time to fill his boots, as Aldrich went to enormous lengths to remind him (Aldrich was a great believer in humiliating a performance out of comparatively inexperienced actors). Yet despite having so much going against it, it's not bad at all even if it is one of those comedies that's more amiable rather than hilarious, surprisingly avoiding the temptation to get cheap laughs from religion while still playing on the inevitable culture clashes that arise along the way. There are some nice spins on the odd clich&eacute;, be it the difficulty in raising a posse from townsfolk who don't have money in the bank or the problems of going on the run on the Sabbath, some good support from Val Bisoglio's chief and William Smith's bad guy and just enough jokes to carry it over the slow patches even if few of them are exactly new.Warner's Region 1 DVD has a decent widescreen transfer but only a brief teaser trailer as extra.",3,"""You, you have a big heart.
