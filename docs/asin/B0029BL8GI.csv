1256746,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0029BL8GI,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","MEET THE PEOPLE stars Lucille Ball and Dick Powell, and it's assumed that a pairing like that is a shoe-in for a good time at the movies. MEET THE PEOPLE instead is a mediocre 1944 musical comedy. This was Powell's final musical before the aging matin&eacute;e idol shifted genres and finally landed those dramatic roles. See, later in 1944, he'd dip his toe in film noir with the classicMurder, My Sweet. MURDER, MY SWEET successfully reinvented Powell's image from crooner to world-weary tough guy. And while he would still occasionally dabble in lighthearted cinema in later years, he would never look back.The plot is thin. A war drive in Morganville, Delaware wins shipyard riveter William ""Swanny"" Swanson (Powell) a date with Broadway star Julie Hampton (Ball). Except that Swanny isn't at all on the make; no, he's got his eye on the bigger picture. Swanny has written a stage play that celebrates the common folk, and he wants Julie to help him get it produced. Julie, by this time, is smitten and she pulls strings and gets financial backing for the show. She means to star in it. And when Swanny, unhappy with the garish spin put on his play, challenges Julie that ""to play the people, you have to meet the people,"" she signs on as a lady welder at his shipyard in Morganville. Not too long before the press gets wind of this.For once I found myself not liking a Powell character much. Swanny Swanson comes off as insufferable, pretty full of himself. He's too judgmental about Julie, doubting her sincerity and effort, even though she's doing her very best to please him. So, yeah, there's that. The script doesn't really allow Lucille Ball to shine, although she's immediately likable. The songs are mostly forgettable, although a June Allyson sighting has her singing ""I'd Like to Recognize the Tune."" The best (and most droll and catchy) tune isn't sung by Powell. No, the best song belongs to the deadpan Virginia O'Brien who warbles out ""Say That We're Sweethearts Again."" I don't think she changed expression one bit during that song.Mostly, MEET THE PEOPLE is a rah-rah musical revue, its flimsy plot just an excuse to trot out a succession of tedious musical numbers and novelty acts (although, okay, the acrobat girl was pretty d0pe). Meanwhile, I loved Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion, but I think that's all I've ever loved him in. I don't love his leaden humor here. 2.5 out of 5 stars for MEET THE PEOPLE. Powell picked the perfect time to jump ship from the musical genre. Or, actually, he was one musical too late.",3,"""I never knew that our romance had ended until you poisoned my food.""",1352073600,"11 5, 2012",2012,2540,"['MEET', 'THE', 'PEOPLE', 'stars', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'Dick', 'Powell', 'assumed', 'pairing', 'shoe-in', 'good', 'time', 'movies', 'MEET', 'THE', 'PEOPLE', 'instead', 'mediocre', '1944', 'musical', 'comedy', 'was', 'Powell', 'final', 'musical', 'aging', 'matin', 'eacute', 'idol', 'shifted', 'genres', 'finally', 'landed', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'See', 'later', '1944', ""'d"", 'dip', 'toe', 'film', 'noir', 'classicMurder', 'My', 'Sweet', 'MURDER', 'MY', 'SWEET', 'successfully', 'reinvented', 'Powell', 'image', 'crooner', 'world-weary', 'tough', 'guy', 'would', 'still', 'occasionally', 'dabble', 'lighthearted', 'cinema', 'later', 'years', 'would', 'never', 'look', 'back.The', 'plot', 'thin', 'A', 'war', 'drive', 'Morganville', 'Delaware', 'shipyard', 'riveter', 'William', 'Swanny', 'Swanson', 'Powell', 'date', 'Broadway', 'star', 'Julie', 'Hampton', 'Ball', 'Swanny', ""n't"", 'make', 'got', 'eye', 'bigger', 'picture', 'Swanny', 'written', 'stage', 'play', 'common', 'folk', 'Julie', 'help', 'get', 'produced', 'Julie', 'time', 'smitten', 'strings', 'financial', 'backing', 'show', 'star', 'when', 'Swanny', 'unhappy', 'garish', 'spin', 'put', 'play', 'Julie', 'play', 'people', 'have', 'meet', 'people', 'signs', 'lady', 'welder', 'shipyard', 'Morganville', 'Not', 'too', 'long', 'press', 'this.For', 'once', 'found', 'not', 'liking', 'Powell', 'character', 'much', 'Swanny', 'Swanson', 'off', 'insufferable', 'pretty', 'full', 'too', 'judgmental', 'Julie', 'doubting', 'sincerity', 'effort', 'even', 'doing', 'very', 'best', 'please', 'So', 'yeah', 'script', ""n't"", 'really', 'allow', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'shine', 'immediately', 'likable', 'songs', 'are', 'mostly', 'forgettable', 'June', 'Allyson', 'sighting', 'singing', ""'d"", 'Recognize', 'Tune', 'best', 'most', 'droll', 'catchy', 'tune', ""n't"", 'sung', 'Powell', 'No', 'best', 'song', 'belongs', 'deadpan', 'Virginia', ""O'Brien"", 'who', 'out', 'Say', ""'re"", 'Sweethearts', 'Again', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'changed', 'expression', 'one', 'bit', 'song.Mostly', 'MEET', 'THE', 'PEOPLE', 'rah-rah', 'musical', 'revue', 'flimsy', 'plot', 'just', 'excuse', 'trot', 'out', 'succession', 'tedious', 'musical', 'numbers', 'novelty', 'acts', 'okay', 'acrobat', 'girl', 'was', 'pretty', 'd0pe', 'Meanwhile', 'loved', 'Bert', 'Lahr', 'Cowardly', 'Lion', 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'loved', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'leaden', 'humor', 'here', '2.5', '5', 'stars', 'MEET', 'THE', 'PEOPLE', 'Powell', 'picked', 'perfect', 'time', 'jump', 'ship', 'musical', 'genre', 'actually', 'was', 'one', 'musical', 'too', 'late']",Meet the People
