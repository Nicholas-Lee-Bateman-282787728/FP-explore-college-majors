1010588,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B000H6SXTW,Einsatz,"[0, 0]","This is an odd movie, too long by half; it reminded me of a lot of other movies I've seen along similar plotlines.  It's your typical BIG BUGS want to take over the world scenario.  Their reasons for doing so were lack of food on their home world and that they knew they could manage the natural resources of Earth better than we have.  Of course, by resources they mean people (bred for food.  I guess that would make us aphids?).With a less than auspicious beginning, it's no wonder this epic isn't more highly regarded.  They leisurely/briefly introduced a clump of characters then abruptly discarded them; amiably peeking back in at their lives at various points from time to time.  There was no hurry, no intrigue, no suspense to start things out.  They just showed people going about their business until eventually they brought them together and then the action finally began (too late to satisfy me).  This movie is so low-key, so lackadaisical; one wonders why they even bothered to thwart the plans of the superior bug race.  Then again, what else did they have to do; most of the characters were out of jobs at that point.At least this movie was consistent throughout.  The characters were all more or less stupid, the only reason they got away with so many things was because they could count on everyone else being equally stupid.  A lot of the decisions made didn't make sense, starting with the astronaut the bugs saved because they were afraid of him/his blood.  They could have easily solved that by jettisoning him in space in the first place.  I spent a great deal of time questioning the motives of every action/choice depicted; it's as if they filmed the rough draft without vetting its likelihood or logic behind what they were making these people do.  It also didn't help that the hero (Gil Bellows) was basically incompetent (not to mention unlikable).  As for the astronaut who started the whole thing, Campbell Scott might as well have not been in this movie, he was rarely used and of that, hardly anything one would brag about.  Then there's the bug queen.  Daryl Hannah hasn't exactly had a sterling career thus far so I doubt that appearing in this one did irrevocable harm to her legacy.  I suppose that if everyone involved tried just a little harder this might have been okay.  As it is......eh.I'm still trying to figure out how those gigantic bugs fit inside a person without the pointy bits sticking out!",2,"""They're just bugs.

Usually, one would have to tune into the SciFi Channel's original Saturday night movie for such an inept little alien film.  But Hallmark wasn't content to let SciFi bask in all the bad science fiction glory, so we get the epic (almost 3 hour) ""Final Days of Planet Earth.""Apparently as the Earth's days are numbered, logic becomes a less important commodity!  In ""Final Days,"" we're treated to a full-on invasion of bug people.  These creatures look like preying mantis', and don't talk when in this form.  They work and or threaten menacingly.  However, they are also able to wear human skin--and when they're in this guise, they can blend in intelligently, productively and without detection.  The only real giveaway is that they don't blink--so watch carefully!!!  (I'm sorry, but even this rule is broken.)Of course, they want to feed on what we humans have to offer!  The head alien insects, former astronauts that flew on the same mission, have inexplicably all gotten jobs at City Hall.  (For some reason, this unnamed city is quite a draw.)  They're all in influential positions, as well--including Mayor's Assistant and Chief of Police! No one has yet to make this connection.  Seems like someone might think it was coincidental, especially since the mission is well publicized--many characters can recall details of it from memory.Well, now you're thinking--but what of the heroes?  Who will save us?  Don't fear--wait until you meet this bunch.  You see, the aliens choose their victims by a great, unconventional method.  If one of them sees you, and you're either on to something alien-esque or just plain annoying the bureaucrats--they give you a hand written invitation to a mysterious office in City Hall.  Behind this nondescript office door, which no one notices, is a cavernous, industrial hallway and pressurized hatch.  I won't spoil too much, but I might have found it strange when I opened this door for my appointment--though I'm no expert on City Hall.We get an archeologist who has experienced a weird phenomenon on his dig, an exterminator whose too good at her job, an old man from a shelter whose noticed birds missing from the park, a crooked salesman who has bothered an unemployment officer, and a woman whose missing husband worked as a City Hall janitor.  Don't worry if this sounds like a meager bunch--they are surprisingly well armed.  Our archeologist carries and brandishes a gun for no conceivable reason, our exterminator loves her tazer, and the old man has a grenade (yes, I said it--a grenade).  They need help, so they look for the lead astronaut from the space mission.  He is being held and tortured in a top secret facility, but don't worry--the janitor's wife works with computers.  So with 5 minutes in an Internet cafe and Google, they locate him, break him out and he joins the ragtag band.This good astronaut is played by Campbell Scott, the acting legacy of George C. Scott and Colleen Dewhurst.  Having worked with no less than Bertolucci and winning awards for films like ""Big Night"" and the woefully overlooked ""Roger Dodger,"" one would like to think he saw some artistic merit in this film.  ""Final Days"" also boasts the immense talents of Daryl Hannah and Gil Bellows as the other ""name"" talent.I was amused by the silliness of this film, the absolute lack of logic or common sense.  But when films are harmless entertainment and don't aspire to anything more--I'm usually nicer than when films are pretentious, self-important, or purposefully condescending.

Moreover, in the beginning it's too abstract and difficult to follow, but most of it falls into place soon enough.  One thing we're never told is how and why Commander Phillips has such an effect on the baddies...In short, the setting, the music and the acting are pretty good, the action/special effects are just average, the plot is interesting, while the dialogues are rather poor.In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it.  3.5 Stars",4,Daryl Hannah and a host of unknowns...,1186790400,"08 11, 2007",2007,1475,"['surprisingly', 'good', 'film', 'Final', 'Days', 'Planet', 'Earth', 'screen', 'story', 'unlikely', 'group', 'people', 'have', 'banded', 'together', 'effort', 'uncover', 'plot', 'could', 'spell', 'end', 'human', 'civilization', 'know', 'it.An', 'archaeologist', 'motley', 'crew', 'band', 'who', 'share', 'something', 'common', ""'ve"", 'been', 'chosen', 'become', 'hosts', 'fertilizer', 'service', 'very', 'desperate', 'rather', 'anxious', 'alien', 'life', 'forms', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'being', 'only', 'well', 'known', 'actors', 'disappoints', 'performance', 'forced', 'unnatural', 'rest', 'cast', 'carry', 'out', 'performances', 'pretty', 'well', 'nothing', 'great', 'establish', 'likable', 'characters.Although', 'was', 'pleasure', 'see', 'lovely', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'again', 'good', 'acting', 'part', 'bit', 'exposure', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'right', 'film', ""n't"", 'start', 'off', 'strong', 'instead', 'up', '20', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Moreover', 'beginning', 'too', 'abstract', 'difficult', 'follow', 'most', 'place', 'soon', 'enough', 'One', 'thing', ""'re"", 'never', 'told', 'how', 'why', 'Commander', 'Phillips', 'such', 'effect', 'baddies', 'short', 'setting', 'music', 'acting', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'action/special', 'effects', 'are', 'just', 'average', 'plot', 'interesting', 'dialogues', 'are', 'rather', 'nutshell', 'probably', 'not', 'movie', 'would', 'want', 'add', 'collection', 'will', 'provide', 'evening', 'entertainment', '3.5', 'Stars']",Final Days of Planet Earth

Gil Bellows saves the film from being a total washout. He plays a good hero. Daryl Hannah has often been criticized, and if this was her comeback, it didn't work. I really loved her in ""Splash"" and ""Steel Magnolias"". She's not convincing as a mean person. Campbell Scott played crazy, and he was okay in a difficult role. Not bad, really, but it will satisfy those who enjoy movies ""so bad, they're good"".
