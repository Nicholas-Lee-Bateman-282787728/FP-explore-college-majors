922344,A1MCQLJGZ2ODCK,B000A6RFFC,Amazon Customer,"[3, 3]","I am going through Power 90, and this is essential in my opinion. If you are on the fence because you hear it is the same, I am saying you should get it for the following reasons. The workouts are the same, but the intensity is higher, the pace is faster, and Tony is more motivating to keep moving and work hard. The tone of this workout video is unlike the first one, where the tone was figure out the moves, press pause, take your time. There is a little of that in this but it is probably for liability.This version is a lot more intense and will push you harder than 1-2.The moves are the same as the first video with 3 sets for each round instead of 2. Kicking is the only group that is still only 2 sets, but the pace is a lot faster.This video has the ab ripper 200 on it as well. It is 200 situps which is also the same, you do 20 for each different ab exercise instead of 10.",5,Move up and see better results,1332288000,"03 21, 2012",2012,885,"['am', 'going', 'Power', '90', 'essential', 'opinion', 'are', 'fence', 'hear', 'same', 'am', 'saying', 'should', 'get', 'following', 'reasons', 'workouts', 'are', 'same', 'intensity', 'higher', 'pace', 'faster', 'Tony', 'more', 'motivating', 'keep', 'moving', 'work', 'hard', 'tone', 'workout', 'video', 'first', 'one', 'where', 'tone', 'was', 'figure', 'out', 'moves', 'press', 'pause', 'take', 'time', 'little', 'probably', 'liability.This', 'version', 'lot', 'more', 'intense', 'will', 'push', 'harder', '1-2.The', 'moves', 'are', 'same', 'first', 'video', '3', 'sets', 'round', 'instead', '2', 'Kicking', 'only', 'group', 'still', 'only', '2', 'sets', 'pace', 'lot', 'faster.This', 'video', 'ab', 'ripper', '200', 'as', 'well', '200', 'situps', 'also', 'same', 'do', '20', 'different', 'ab', 'exercise', 'instead', '10']",Power 90 Sweat Cardio 3-4

922347,A2AV37AKRQZSYY,B000A6RFFC,Lauren  B,"[12, 14]","This workout is very challenging. It consists of sequenced basic cardio moves such as jumping jacks, various leg kicks, punches, etc. There is even a round of Power Yoga at the beginning, following stretches. You really break a sweat with this one! I find myself having to slow down and I am a fairly advanced exerciser. However, Tony Horton, the instructor, is a little annoying and has a way of mildly teasing the individuals doing the video along with him. I also find that this workout is so repetitive and boring that I couldn't bring myself to stick with the 90 day program. Ninety days of doing the same moves with no fun involved? I think I will stick with The Firm, but this workout is great when you want a little change once in a wihle. I would recommend for those that don't care about variety. I danced for years, so this is simply too basic for me.",4,Challenging every time!,1139702400,"02 12, 2006",2006,862,"['workout', 'very', 'challenging', 'sequenced', 'basic', 'cardio', 'moves', 'such', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'various', 'leg', 'kicks', 'punches', 'etc', 'even', 'round', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'beginning', 'following', 'stretches', 'really', 'break', 'sweat', 'one', 'find', 'having', 'slow', 'down', 'am', 'fairly', 'advanced', 'exerciser', 'However', 'Tony', 'Horton', 'instructor', 'little', 'annoying', 'way', 'mildly', 'teasing', 'individuals', 'doing', 'video', 'also', 'find', 'workout', 'so', 'repetitive', 'boring', 'could', ""n't"", 'bring', 'stick', '90', 'day', 'program', 'Ninety', 'days', 'doing', 'same', 'moves', 'fun', 'involved', 'think', 'will', 'stick', 'Firm', 'workout', 'great', 'when', 'want', 'little', 'change', 'once', 'wihle', 'would', 'recommend', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'variety', 'danced', 'years', 'simply', 'too', 'basic']",Power 90 Sweat Cardio 3-4
