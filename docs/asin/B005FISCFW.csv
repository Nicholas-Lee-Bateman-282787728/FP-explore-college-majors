In my opinion, Kucher is a great replacement and a likable character. However, I am not terribly fond of how the whole thing was set up. There were a million ways they could have made Allen a likable character while still introducing Walden as in interesting new best friend. Unfortunately they chose to reduce Allen to a disagreeable joke of a character who is so pathetic he doesn't even bother to go to work. It is really rather hard to believe Walden would want him around.

1458240,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,B005FISCFW,Dr. James Gardner,"[37, 44]","For 8 seasons ""2  Men"" was one of the biggest shows on TV and garnered dozens of awards, including 4 People's Choice wins, and Emmy wins for editing, mixing, and supporting actor. Charlie Sheen was nominated for a Golden Globe in 2005 and 2006 and by the SAG in 2005 and 2010. Then the crash. Then the revival.Is the new show as awful as some critics suggest? No, not when you compare it to the trash that passes for TV comedy these days (apologies to ""Big Bang Theory"" and ""Two Broke Girls""). But when you look back at the previous 8 seasons, there has been a major drop in the quality of the writing and the acting.It can't all be blamed on Ashton Kutcher, although one has to question whether or not you can take someone seriously when he continually appears naked and when so many jokes are made about the size of his penis. Really?! The ""man boy"" thing gets pretty tired.Poor Jon Cryer has deteriorated not only as an actor, but his character on the show has changed to someone with no redeeming qualities. In the previous seasons he had a job, tried to relate to his son, and did his best to get along with his ex wives even though he was inept. Now he is simply a manipulative deadbeat. There's no humor there.In past seasons lots of laughs could be counted on whenever Conchata Ferrell (the housekeeper), Holland Taylor (the mother), and Melanie Lynskey (Rose, the stalker) showed up. In Season 9 we never see Rose, rarely see the mother, and the housekeeper's character has also deteriorated greatly. She simply isn't funny anymore.About the only good thing in Season 9 is that Angus T Jones seems to have come into his own, and his scenes are finally funny, after several seasons of blah.What can we do? Certainly don't buy this product which is devoid of laughs. And stop watching the show, if you do, because otherwise they will keep churning out this garbage. Unfortunately I can't recommend watching Sheen's new TV series ""Anger Management"". It's OK - better than  ""2 "", but not up to the old standards.Maybe everyone can bury the hatchet, and we'll find out in Season 11 that Seasons 9 and 10 were all a bad dream, and Charlie is back.

How about this?Rose tells Berta that she is contemplating spreading contradictory rumours that she killed Charlie, that he faked his own death and that Charlie may one day re-appear.Charlie's will mischievously provides that Alan inherits the Malibu beach house as long as he comes clean to Herb about Millie being Alan's child. So that she can keep the memory of Charlie alive through continued Harper occupancy of the neighbouring Malibu beach house, Rose agrees to fund Alan's Malibu beach house property taxes enabling Alan to continue to live there.Alan confesses to Herb about Millie's paternity causing Herb to leave Judith. In search of an everlasting Charlie and believing that her financial generosity has bought her rights over the Harper family, Rose tries to seduce Alan, who rejects her. To spite Alan, Rose then seduces Herb who goes to live with her at her Malibu beach house.In due course Rose, who can no longer keep the delusion of Charlie's supposed return to herself, tells Herb that Charlie may one day re-appear. Herb who has previously, and mistakenly, believed that he is in a secure committed relationship with Rose, is shaken by this threat to his happiness. Herb confides Rose's prediction with Alan.Terrified, Alan now believes that Charlie is about to return and evict Alan once and for all from the beach house. Berta taunts Alan about that possibility although she knows it to be a false rumour created by Rose.Rose, who is now starting to believe her own lies and has become romantically excited about Charlie's imaginary return, kicks Herb out. Herb goes to live with Alan.While Rose makes new plans to stalk Alan, Alan enjoys himself by recreating the Charlie/Alan dynamic with himself as Charlie and Herb as the ever-under-threat-of-eviction underdog Alan.In revenge, Herb steals Lyndsey away from Alan. Alan and Judith patch things up and become romantically re-entwined, but agree that it's better if they continue to live apart - Judith and Millie back in Sherman Oaks and Alan and Jake at the Malibu beach house. Rose stalks Alan and Judith in Sherman Oaks and Malibu. Jake and Eldridge develop their hilarious Rosencrantz and Guildenstern double act. Evelyn and Berta continue to snap at everyone's heels.Problem solved. Chuck Lorre doesn't have to re-hire Charlie Sheen. Charlie Sheen doesn't ever have to work for Chuck Lorre again.

It definatley is NOT the same show. I really, really tried to give it a chance. Ashton Kutcher in my opinion, is really not that funny and certainly was not as funny as Charlie Sheen. Alot of what made the original Two and a Half Men so funny, was Charlie's womanizing, and drunkin ways and how the rest of the characters had to suffer...especially Alan which was downright hilarious. Ashton as Walden seems annoying and there is no laughter there..as I said my opinion.Also alot of comments talked about Jon Cryer and how his character has gotten worse and I agree. There is one thing leeching off your brother but a stranger? anyway the thing I think what also made the original(yes i will call it that)better, is that Sheen and Cryer really seemed to have a great chemistry with each other. I don't seem to get that with Cryer and Kutcher and one poster said that the show should be now called ""Alan and two knuckleheads"" which is funny.

I was apprehensive about what the show would be like without Charlie but I found it to be very funny. And of course they kept the wacko Rose in the show which made it even funnier.

Show was beautifully developed across 8 seasons. We saw Charlie Alan and Jake all age and blossom into a well-balanced cast full of chemistry, with re-occuring characters such as Berta Rose and Evelyn supplementing them well. It was a sad day when Charlie cut ties with the show, and anyone who hoped Ashton could have filled the void would have been thoroughly disappointed. To say season 9 was bad would be an overstatement, it was a flat-out tragedy. Jake's character is simply overkill from what he was in season 8, Alan is trying too hard to beat up his character and short of putting a bullet through his head to emphasize such, is frankly pathetic. Walden is out of place and simply does not fit the persona of the show. I would have been disappointed if Two and a half men choose to go out after season 8 after the fall out with Sheen, but continuing the show in this direction is absolutely pathetic and unfair to it's fans.",1,Run's over,1377734400,"08 29, 2013",2013,1034,"['departure', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'ended', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'comedy', 'sitcom', 'decade', 'Show', 'was', 'beautifully', 'developed', '8', 'seasons', 'saw', 'Charlie', 'Alan', 'Jake', 'age', 'blossom', 'well-balanced', 'cast', 'full', 'chemistry', 're-occuring', 'characters', 'such', 'Berta', 'Rose', 'Evelyn', 'supplementing', 'well', 'was', 'sad', 'day', 'when', 'Charlie', 'cut', 'ties', 'show', 'anyone', 'who', 'hoped', 'Ashton', 'could', 'have', 'filled', 'void', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'thoroughly', 'disappointed', 'say', 'season', '9', 'was', 'bad', 'would', 'be', 'overstatement', 'was', 'flat-out', 'tragedy', 'Jake', 'character', 'simply', 'overkill', 'what', 'was', 'season', '8', 'Alan', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'beat', 'up', 'character', 'short', 'putting', 'bullet', 'head', 'emphasize', 'such', 'frankly', 'pathetic', 'Walden', 'place', 'simply', 'not', 'fit', 'persona', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'disappointed', 'Two', 'half', 'men', 'choose', 'go', 'out', 'season', '8', 'fall', 'out', 'Sheen', 'continuing', 'show', 'direction', 'absolutely', 'pathetic', 'unfair', 'fans']",Two and a Half Men: S9 (DVD)
