While not up to Batman: TAS standards (what is?), the writing is pretty good & the animation is great, not the awful CGI garbage the 90's F4 & modern Transformers cartoons suffer from.  The storylines could be a little better as the whole Hulk vs Gen. Ross while he searches for a cure gets boring fast.  Plus, it's always a disgrace when cartoons aren't released in season sets.",3,A season set please,1164672000,"11 28, 2006",2006,431,"['Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', ""n't"", 'thought', 'more', 'not', 'Batman', 'TAS', 'standards', 'what', 'writing', 'pretty', 'good', 'animation', 'great', 'not', 'awful', 'CGI', 'garbage', '90', 'F4', 'modern', 'Transformers', 'cartoons', 'suffer', 'storylines', 'could', 'be', 'little', 'better', 'whole', 'Hulk', 'vs', 'Gen.', 'Ross', 'cure', 'boring', 'fast', 'always', 'disgrace', 'when', 'cartoons', 'are', ""n't"", 'released', 'season', 'sets']",N/A

736765,A3DM6UGX44NJ9K,B000089G5S,"Daigo Parry ""Hodor""","[21, 26]","This disc showcases the first four episodes of what I believe was a 13-episode single season (which wasn't followed up). The art is passable, above the level of GI Joe and Transformers, and closer to the animation in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Ghostbusters or (if you remember this) Dino Riders series. The episodes are self-containing and don't really branch out and connect to other episodes (other than the two-part ""Beast"" story). There are other supporting characters other than the Hulk shown in this series, which makes it an interesting mix.The extras are definitely worth your while. The 1966 clip is hilarious, especially in comparison to the recent movie and this DVD. Pay attention to the inappropriately paced and melodied opening theme song and the art, basically stills with large ""Pow!"" and ""Bam!"" type sound effects layed over, or shifting eyes. The trivia and the Stan Lee Soapbox should keep you entertained for a good 15 to 25 minutes, which also goes for the interview with writer Peter David.At the end of your viewing session, you'll have a more complete understanding of what the Hulk is about and how things about the Hulk have evolved, kind of like a mini-documentary.

Buy this only if your child absolutely loves the Hulk and is too young to watch the PG-13 rated live action film, The Incredible Hulk, starring Edward Norton. Check my review of that DVD (good movie but absolutely not for little kids).I game a similar review to the first animated DVD from The Spectacular Spider-Man, the new series from the WB. You should get more for your money than 3-4 episodes. In the case of Spider-Man, it looks promising that the entire first series will be released. So far, the Hulk hasn't had the same luck.Also, please avoid the new Avengers animated DVDs. I made the mistake of picking these up without checking the ratings -- they feature the Hulk, but the stories and the language are not for young children.If you're looking for better choices for your little superhero fan, check out my Amazon listmania list, ""Batman / Dark Knight entertainment for little boys"" and have fun!",2,83 minutes is not enough value for the price,1224633600,"10 22, 2008",2008,1021,"['83', 'minutes', 'four', 'episodes', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'animated', 'series', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'value', 'dollar', 'Buy', 'only', 'child', 'absolutely', 'Hulk', 'too', 'young', 'watch', 'PG-13', 'rated', 'live', 'action', 'film', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'starring', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Check', 'review', 'DVD', 'good', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'not', 'little', 'kids', '.I', 'game', 'similar', 'review', 'first', 'animated', 'DVD', 'Spectacular', 'Spider-Man', 'new', 'series', 'WB', 'should', 'get', 'more', 'money', '3-4', 'episodes', 'case', 'Spider-Man', 'promising', 'entire', 'first', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'So', 'far', 'Hulk', ""n't"", 'had', 'same', 'luck.Also', 'please', 'avoid', 'new', 'Avengers', 'animated', 'DVDs', 'made', 'mistake', 'picking', 'checking', 'ratings', 'feature', 'Hulk', 'stories', 'language', 'are', 'not', 'young', 'children.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'better', 'choices', 'little', 'superhero', 'fan', 'check', 'out', 'Amazon', 'listmania', 'list', 'Batman', '/', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'entertainment', 'little', 'boys', 'have', 'fun']",N/A

736771,A3TISHGXRLMTTV,B000089G5S,Patrick Correa,"[0, 0]","Like several other Marvel characters, Hulk got his own animated series during the 90s.  I had rented a tape of the 80s cartoon not long before this show came out, & I loved it but I came to love this even more.  It was a pretty dark series that perfectly captured the atmosphere of the comics.  But unfortunately the stupid executives decreed it had to be toned down for kids, & made She-Hulk a major character, which wouldn't have been bad if she was like in the first season, but it was a different She-Hulk, with a new voice & a stupid new personality.  Even as a kid I hated the change, & so the show died a quick death.  A pity because it could have made a really good series but at least the first season is still excellent.  This DVD contains the first 4 episodes.  Here's a review of each, with synopsizes from Wikipedia.1-2.  Return of the Beast:  Bruce Banner attempts to cure himself of the Hulk once again, but his experiment is shut down by General Ross and Major Talbot. They capture the Hulk and take him to the Gamma Base. While on the base, Banner recalls his origin. Suddenly, the Abomination arrives on the scene, sent by the Leader and Gargoyle to capture Banner, and it's up to the Hulk to stop him.  This is an excellent start to the series.  A+3.  Raw Power:  The Hulk encounters Mitch McCougthen, a man who absolutely hates his job and yearns for a higher position in life. Later, Bruce befriends him and the two of them try to see if they can get rid of the Hulk. However, their experiment goes awry and McCoughten turns into Zzzax, a being of pure energy. Can the Hulk stop him before he destroys a dam?  My least favorite episode on the disc and of the season to be honest, but it's still above average.  A-4.  Helping Hand, Iron Fist:  Bruce Banner travels to Los Angeles hoping to reach Tony Stark at Stark Industries, with Rick Jones right behind him. Will Iron Man, War Machine, and HOMER be able to cure Banner before Gabriel Jones and SHIELD bring down the house?  The best episode on the disc.  As a huge fan of Iron Man's show, this was a real treat.  A+So buy it, & maybe the other 9 first season episodes will be released on DVD.  Come on Disney, it would only take 2 more discs for the rest of the season, or a 2-disc first season set (or 3 discs if you wanted a complete collection, the second season only lasted 8 episodes; what a surprise).",5,Stupid Disney not release whole first season!
