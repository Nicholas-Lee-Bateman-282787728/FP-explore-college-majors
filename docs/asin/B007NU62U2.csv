I always feel it the next day especially inner thighs for some reason. Its great also in the evenings when i want to do a quick 15 mins I pop it on.

1535136,A15S9OH2IG6VVD,B007NU62U2,betweenthepages,"[2, 3]","I bought this DVD on impulse from Target several weeks ago. I was mainly drawn in by the fact it is kickboxing based (which I love) and features Jessica Smith, my favorite ""Hollywood trainer."" When I tried it out the next day I knew I had made the right decision. This DVD gets you a LOT of bang for your buck--the workout is 75 minutes long for the same price as many 30-min workout DVDs. The workouts are FUN to do, challenging but never too straining, and at the end there is a 15 minute Tai-chi sequence which will leave you feeling balanced and refreshed. This is the perfect morning workout to make your whole day feel a lot more productive!",5,Loving it!

1535140,A2HH0D6MEQMPGZ,B007NU62U2,"N. Worland ""Modern Fitness and Music Loving Mom""","[9, 9]","I put this DVD in on a Sunday morning expecting to get a calm, light workout - that was not the case!  Although the whole mood of this video is very calm and relaxing, it was quite the challenge!  I did the whole thing in its entirety, which clocks in at 75 minutes!  The workout can also be broken into 5 15-minute segments, which is nice, so I can pick and choose which ones I want to do when I am pressed for time.  Both of Guillermo Gomez's segments are fun cardio kickboxing workouts.  I found them fun and easy to learn on the first try.  I broke a sweat, but they didn't leave me out of breath.  A beginner could pick these up easily.  Jessica Smith's segments were the surprise!  I am a huge fan of her workouts, and her segments do not disappoint! They were challenging, and more on the intermediate side.  Her first segment is full body toning (no weights) and the second is core toning (also no weights).  They were tough and I am feeling the burn in all of my muscles the day after (especially the thighs, glutes, triceps, and lower abs).The last segment was a very relaxing stretch with tai chi and chi gong moves. This part was led by Gomez, with Smith chiming in occassionally.  I really enjoyed it! It included lots of slow stretches and deep breathing.  One thing that I noticed during this segment was the awkward banter between the two.  I know that they are currently married, but I don't know if they were a couple at the time the video was made. It seemed like every time she made a comment, he would retort back in an arrogant way.  For example, she would say something like ""I really feel this stretch in my legs"" and he would snap back ""this stretch works everywhere""...  It doesn't detract from the quality of the segment, but it was noticeable.Overall, this was a very enjoyable, challenging workout.  I don't have anything else like it in my (large) collection of workout DVDs.",5,Love It!
