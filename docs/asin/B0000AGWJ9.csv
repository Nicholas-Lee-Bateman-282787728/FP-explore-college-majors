Then we see her life before as singer Angelica Evans in a nightclub. [Who is singing?] She meets her friend Ken Conway (his band folded). Will her singing career be ended by marriage? Will a child bring happiness? Do personal relationships help in show business? Ken sings the Western songs popular in those days. [Who is singing?] Angie has to go to the hospital and delivers a girl. Ken becomes more popular. Life is beautiful. Success means worrying about income tax. A performer must be prompted to become successful. What was she scared of? Ken Conway becomes even more popular and successful. [What need does he fill?] They move to Sutton Place on the upper East Side. It overlooks the East River where they can look down on people.Does Angelica begin drinking too much? Will she have nightmares? Is there stress? ""Everything is just great."" Or is it? Martha will assist Ken in Chicago. Angel drank too much. Her baby gets sick, a special nurse is needed. Is there a problem in communicating? The ""bobby-soxers"" love Ken Conway, Is idleness best for rich wives? Does it cause alcoholism? Can Angel cure herself? Should she take more responsibility? Will she grow suspicious? Or lose her self-respect? What next? An angry drunk? ""He's gone, Mrs. Conway."" She remembers nothing, its all a blank. Will there be a divorce? Can she resume her career? Will there e more conflict among those show-business people? Will Angelica drink too much? Can anyone save her? Will they cover up the news? Will a dropped cigarette cause a tragedy? Dr. Lorenz provides a diagnostic over their problems, an explanation that cures the problems like a magic spell. All will be well again. Hollywood needs a happy ending for commercial success even if it departs from the past story.This film is a psychological drama about relationships in show business and other groups. How do their problems compare to ""Ma and Pa Kettle"" or other films that deal with ordinary people? The message of this movie is that some expert can solve problems by just talking about them. That does not always cure the underlying causes of problems. Do such problems occur when a husband becomes more successful in other areas of society?",2,Psychological Drama about Show Business,1245196800,"06 17, 2009",2009,2304,"['film', 'view', 'New', 'York', 'Hospital', 'where', 'woman', 'bandaged', 'bed', 'drink', 'Then', 'see', 'life', 'singer', 'Angelica', 'Evans', 'nightclub', '[', 'Who', 'singing', 'friend', 'Ken', 'Conway', 'band', 'folded', 'Will', 'singing', 'career', 'be', 'ended', 'marriage', 'Will', 'child', 'bring', 'happiness', 'Do', 'personal', 'relationships', 'help', 'show', 'business', 'Ken', 'Western', 'songs', 'popular', 'days', '[', 'Who', 'singing', ']', 'Angie', 'go', 'hospital', 'girl', 'Ken', 'more', 'popular', 'Life', 'beautiful', 'Success', 'worrying', 'income', 'tax', 'performer', 'must', 'be', 'prompted', 'become', 'successful', 'What', 'was', 'scared', 'Ken', 'Conway', 'even', 'more', 'popular', 'successful', '[', 'What', 'need', 'fill', ']', 'move', 'Sutton', 'Place', 'upper', 'East', 'Side', 'East', 'River', 'where', 'can', 'look', 'down', 'people.Does', 'Angelica', 'begin', 'drinking', 'too', 'much', 'Will', 'have', 'nightmares', 'there', 'stress', 'Everything', 'just', 'great', 'Martha', 'will', 'assist', 'Ken', 'Chicago', 'Angel', 'drank', 'too', 'much', 'baby', 'sick', 'special', 'nurse', 'needed', 'there', 'problem', 'communicating', 'bobby-soxers', 'love', 'Ken', 'Conway', 'Is', 'idleness', 'best', 'rich', 'wives', 'cause', 'alcoholism', 'Can', 'Angel', 'cure', 'Should', 'take', 'more', 'responsibility', 'Will', 'grow', 'suspicious', 'lose', 'self-respect', 'What', 'angry', 'drunk', 'gone', 'Mrs', 'Conway', 'nothing', 'blank', 'Will', 'there', 'be', 'divorce', 'Can', 'resume', 'career', 'Will', 'there', 'e', 'more', 'conflict', 'show-business', 'people', 'Will', 'Angelica', 'drink', 'too', 'much', 'Can', 'anyone', 'save', 'Will', 'cover', 'up', 'news', 'Will', 'dropped', 'cigarette', 'cause', 'tragedy', 'Dr.', 'Lorenz', 'diagnostic', 'problems', 'explanation', 'problems', 'magic', 'spell', 'will', 'be', 'well', 'again', 'Hollywood', 'happy', 'ending', 'commercial', 'success', 'even', 'past', 'story.This', 'film', 'psychological', 'drama', 'relationships', 'show', 'business', 'other', 'groups', 'How', 'do', 'problems', 'compare', 'Ma', 'Pa', 'Kettle', 'other', 'films', 'deal', 'ordinary', 'people', 'message', 'movie', 'expert', 'can', 'solve', 'problems', 'just', 'talking', 'not', 'always', 'cure', 'underlying', 'causes', 'problems', 'Do', 'such', 'problems', 'occur', 'when', 'husband', 'more', 'successful', 'other', 'areas', 'society']",N/A

Her performance is right on target with many facets and dimensions that allow us to really feel right along with her, what she is going through.  In 1947 she was up against Rosalind Russell (Mourning Becomes Electra), Dorothy McGuire (Gentleman's Agreement), Joan Crawford (Possessed) and Loretta Young (The Farmer's Daughter).  Having seen all of the performances of the above and being a fan of all the actresses above, not favoring one over the other, I would have given my vote to Hayward!  In my opinion, she is better in this film than her other two alcoholic portrayals that earned her Oscar Nominations as well..namely, ""My Foolish Heart"" and ""I'll Cry Tomorrow"".The rest of the film is ably abetted by a strong supporting cast with the possible exception of Lee Bowman who plays her ambivalent, non-empathetic husband.  He is wooden and unlikeable throughout.  Eddie Albert and Marsha Hunt turn in wonderful performance, the latter exceptional in two scenes...one in where she and Hayward have a catfight, the other in which she sacrifices her love for Bowman to do the honorable thing because she knows Bowman will never leave Hayward for her.Soapy, yes, but good soap.The DVD transfer is fine, but Alpha Video which produced this DVD cuts off the beginning UNIVERSAL/INTERNATIONAL logo which I feel is important to every picture that I watch.  This may be a minor thing but it irks me.  The rest of the DVD is just fine, the audio and picture great!!I would give the movie five stars total were it not for Alpha's cheap video and the mediocre performance of Bowman.",4,GREAT HAYWARD MOVIE ALL THE WAY!!,1098144000,"10 19, 2004",2004,1833,"['Susan', 'Hayward', 'first', 'five', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performances', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'one', 'opinion', 'riveting', 'portrayal', 'woman', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'alcoholism', 'nearly', 'precious', 'performance', 'right', 'target', 'many', 'facets', 'dimensions', 'allow', 'really', 'feel', 'right', 'what', 'going', '1947', 'was', 'up', 'Rosalind', 'Russell', 'Mourning', 'Becomes', 'Electra', 'Dorothy', 'McGuire', 'Gentleman', 'Agreement', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'Possessed', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'Farmer', 'Daughter', 'Having', 'seen', 'performances', 'above', 'being', 'fan', 'actresses', 'not', 'favoring', 'one', 'other', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'vote', 'Hayward', 'opinion', 'better', 'film', 'other', 'two', 'alcoholic', 'portrayals', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'Nominations', 'well..namely', 'Foolish', 'Heart', ""'ll"", 'Cry', 'Tomorrow', '.The', 'rest', 'film', 'ably', 'abetted', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'possible', 'exception', 'Lee', 'Bowman', 'who', 'ambivalent', 'non-empathetic', 'husband', 'wooden', 'unlikeable', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'Marsha', 'Hunt', 'turn', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'latter', 'exceptional', 'two', 'scenes', 'one', 'where', 'Hayward', 'have', 'catfight', 'other', 'love', 'Bowman', 'do', 'honorable', 'thing', 'Bowman', 'will', 'never', 'leave', 'Hayward', 'her.Soapy', 'yes', 'good', 'soap.The', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'fine', 'Alpha', 'Video', 'produced', 'DVD', 'beginning', 'UNIVERSAL/INTERNATIONAL', 'logo', 'feel', 'important', 'picture', 'watch', 'may', 'be', 'minor', 'thing', 'rest', 'DVD', 'just', 'fine', 'audio', 'picture', 'great', 'would', 'give', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'total', 'were', 'not', 'Alpha', 'cheap', 'video', 'mediocre', 'performance', 'Bowman']",N/A

But when her husband Ken's (Lee Bowman) radio career suddenly shifts into high-gear, Angie--unable to cope in the harsh world spotlight--begins taking comfort in the bottom of champagne bottles.Co-starring Marsha Hunt and Eddie Albert, SMASH-UP does offer a blueprint for the eventual performance which Hayward gave in ""I'll Cry Tomorrow""; indeed the fictional Angie shares many similaries with real-life Lillian Roth.  If there is a weak link in the cast it's Lee Bowman; he simply can't match the energy that Hayward generates in their scenes.

Superb audio and video quality. Full of suspense and intrigue. A program everyone will enjoy!The story begins with Angelica Conway who gives up her singing career to become wife and mother, only to watch her husband's stardom rise. While Angelica (Susan Hayward) sits at home, bored and left alone while her husband is busy with his celebrity status, Hayward turns to alcohol to relieve her loneliness and emptiness. Next enters her husband's secretary, Miss Gray, whom Susan Hayward is suspicious of having an affair with her husband. Hayward's jealousy over her husband's secretary, combined with her alcoholism spirals out of control until her husband's exasperation with her, causes her to leave.Angelica, Susan Hayward, hopes to recapture her own career with the help and aid of their friend played by a young and talented, Eddie Albert. Hayward begins singing again, but her career soon ends when her drinking gets in the way of her success. Alone and miserable, she frequents many bars in one night and passes out on a stranger's doorstep. The next morning she is determined to get her daughter back, whom her husband has not allowed her to see. While visiting the young daughter, Hayward is intoxicated again and drops a lit cigarette, nearly causing her little girl's death as she is engulfed in flames, while Hayward is drunkenly unconscious in the living room.See how this tragedy ends. Does Hayward overcome her drinking problem? Does she get her husband and daughter back, or does her life continue to crash and burn?A really good watch! I recommend this movie highly among the great, old classics. You'll be surprised at the twists and turns in this movie, and how it eventually all comes to a startling conclusion.

Susan was only considered as a supporting actress to Paramount's leading ladies before she broke away from the studio and made ""Smash-Up: The Story of a Woman"" with Walter Wagner's guidance. In the 1940's, when an actress approached 30 was considered an end of a career, Susan Hayward made a comeback. Susan Hayward was always the advisory to Paulette Goddard, Veronica Lake and others. Susan Hayward's best parts before Smash-Up were ""Adam Had Four Sons,"" and ""Among The Living."" Susan will keep you entertained throughout the whole movie. True, Lee Bowman's and Eddie Albert's performances were wooden but Susan makes up for the movie with her strong performance. Susan earned her first Oscar nomanitation with this movie. Susan Hayward never gave a bad performance. However, if you want to know what are the best Susan Hayward movies, here are my favorites: Adam Had Four Sons, Smash-Up: The Story of a Woman, My Foolish Heart, I Can Get It For You Wholesale, With a Song In My Heart, I'll Cry Tomorrow, I Want To Live, Back Street* my favorite, Say Goodbye to Maggie Cole.

762946,A14HHOT9999Z22,B0000AGWJ9,"Stephen M. Moser ""The Austin Chronicle""","[2, 2]","Susan Hayward, impossibly young and beautiful, in this Walter Wanger production, portraying Angelica Evans, a young chanteuse with the world at her feet, but who doesn't want the world. She wants Ken Conway, part of an unemployed singing/songwriting duo (sexlessly portrayed by Lee Bowman), but he is socially beneath her. As the effervescent star of a family of performers (who happens to like a little drinkee now and then), Angelica lacks the ambition to continue her singing career. It's easy to understand why - not having been around in 1947, it's hard to imagine that the kind of singing and dancing that Hayward does as Angelica could ever be popular in real life. But, we digress - suffice to say she gives up her career for love. Hubby, and his partner, played by Eddie Albert get jobs as singing cowboys on the radio (another mysteriously popular career in old movies), and he pens a special song - a hideously slurpy ballad called ""Life Can Be Beautiful."" Dispensing with the cowboy routine, hubby sings the song on his radio show one night and become an overnight success, a teen idol - this, of course, is a time when teen idols *weren't* teenagers themselves. He gets hooked up with a management company, and acquires an assistant, a little minx named Martha, wickedly played by Marsha Hunt. Little Martha takes over many aspects of hubby's life, rendering Angelica useless, except as a milk machine for the baby. A few little drinkee-winkees help ease the pain (""It puts *poise* in apathetic people,"" she tells us), but with the drinkees come the attendant drunken dramas and Angelica becomes an embarrassment to her pop star husband. Martha happily manipulates the situation, making sure that Angelica knows that she's no longer needed in every way possible. This culminates in a drunken slapfest at a party, resulting in hubby moving out. Proven to be an unfit mother, Angelica loses custody of her child and naturally dives deeply into the bottle. Drunkenly deciding to kidnap her child, she does so, and nearly kills the child by setting the house on fire with a cigarette. This brings Angelica and hubby back together again, Martha admits there was never anything between them - she just wanted Angelica to *think* so, and everything works out perfectly, with hubby understanding that his wife's alcoholism was caused by his lack of attention to her. Life can be beautiful.

Angie is an up-and-coming nightclub and radio sensation. However, one night she meets a man with a voice of gold and they fall in love. Angie gives up her career to be a wife and later a mother. However, her husband hits the big time and she soon finds herself alone with the baby and a bottle of liquor. She slowly declines in alcoholism until she causes a tragic accident which almost costs her life and that of her child.SMASH-UP is a movie with a lesson. It would seem almost like an after school special, except the movie is made so well it doesn't come off that way. Instead, what is captured on film is a fairly accurate portrayal of what can happen to a person when they become addicted to alcohol. The acting is good and the movie has a very beautiful score. Not too shabby for a preachy, anti-drinking movie.",4,Alcohol Can Make You Do Crazy Things,1077235200,"02 20, 2004",2004,984,"['SMASH-UP', 'THE', 'STORY', 'A', 'WOMAN', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'sister', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', 'Angie', 'Evans', 'young', 'singer', 'who', 'up', 'destroying', 'part', 'life', 'drinking', 'Angie', 'up-and-coming', 'nightclub', 'radio', 'sensation', 'However', 'one', 'night', 'man', 'voice', 'gold', 'fall', 'love', 'Angie', 'up', 'career', 'be', 'wife', 'later', 'mother', 'However', 'husband', 'big', 'time', 'soon', 'alone', 'baby', 'bottle', 'liquor', 'slowly', 'alcoholism', 'tragic', 'accident', 'almost', 'life', 'child.SMASH-UP', 'movie', 'lesson', 'would', 'seem', 'almost', 'school', 'special', 'movie', 'made', 'so', 'well', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'way', 'Instead', 'what', 'captured', 'film', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'person', 'when', 'become', 'addicted', 'alcohol', 'acting', 'good', 'movie', 'very', 'beautiful', 'score', 'Not', 'too', 'shabby', 'preachy', 'anti-drinking', 'movie']",N/A
