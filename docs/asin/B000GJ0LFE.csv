With games ranging from the 1979 Cotton Bowl to the Penn State game in 1992, the set will wake up the echoes of Fighting Irish football - especially for those who haven't experienced it before or are looking to revisit the thrilling days of yesteryear.

He really enjoys reliving those times of his college days.  It's also interesting to watch football before the days of the ""Yellow Line"" and seemingly endless camera angles.Anyway, my dad tends to watch these when he's flying to and from job sites or in a hotel room without an internet connection.  I got them for him about 3 months ago as a Christmas present and he just finished the entire set.I always enjoyed hearing his stories of these games, so it's really nice being able to give something back that means just as much to him.",5,Dad loves it!,1175040000,"03 28, 2007",2007,611,"['dad', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'alumni', 'actually', 'went', 'couple', 'games', 'really', 'reliving', 'times', 'college', 'days', 'also', 'interesting', 'watch', 'football', 'days', 'Yellow', 'Line', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'camera', 'angles.Anyway', 'dad', 'tends', 'watch', 'when', 'flying', 'job', 'sites', 'hotel', 'room', 'internet', 'connection', 'got', 'about', '3', 'months', 'ago', 'Christmas', 'present', 'just', 'finished', 'entire', 'set.I', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'hearing', 'stories', 'games', 'really', 'nice', 'being', 'able', 'give', 'something', 'back', 'just', 'as', 'much']",University of Notre Dame: Fighting Irish

They really tried to make a quality product and it shows.  Great if you're a Notre Dame fan or want to see some classic games in general. Picture quality is generally good but varies from game to game as expected, but it's great just for the nostalgia factor.  Plus, it's fun seeing who was in the top 25 back then as the sports ticker update will show up from time to time during the games.  And at under $60, it is a good bargain.  I bought the USC vs Texas, Notre Dame vs W.V.(which this box set includes), and LSU vs OU nat'l championship games for an average cost of $19 each as an example.  Overall, highly recommended to Irish fans and college football fans with a sense of history.",5,Great Product,1170115200,"01 30, 2007",2007,889,"['8', 'games', '8', 'individual', 'discs', '8', 'slimline', 'cases', 'case', 'containing', 'bevy', 'information', 'game', 'time', 'temp', 'rosters', 'attendance', 'numbers', 'etc', 'housed', 'box', 'cover', 'seen', 'pic', 'really', 'tried', 'make', 'quality', 'product', 'Great', ""'re"", 'Notre', 'Dame', 'fan', 'want', 'see', 'classic', 'games', 'general', 'Picture', 'quality', 'generally', 'good', 'varies', 'game', 'game', 'expected', 'great', 'just', 'nostalgia', 'factor', 'fun', 'seeing', 'who', 'was', 'top', '25', 'back', 'then', 'sports', 'ticker', 'update', 'will', 'show', 'up', 'time', 'time', 'games', '60', 'good', 'bargain', 'bought', 'USC', 'vs', 'Texas', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'vs', 'W.V', 'box', 'set', 'LSU', 'vs', 'OU', 'nat', 'l', 'championship', 'games', 'average', 'cost', '19', 'example', 'Overall', 'highly', 'recommended', 'Irish', 'fans', 'college', 'football', 'fans', 'sense', 'history']",University of Notre Dame: Fighting Irish

I have never seen this kind of detail put into any college football dvd that I have ever purchased.  The  case for each dvd is plastered with facts, rosters, quotes, etc. (even temp at game time)about each game.  Some of the Irish's best games are included and I'm thankful that the Lou Holtz era is well represented.  I do not have the budget to collect many football dvd's so price is a concern, making me doubly blessed with this set at this sale price.  Any one of these games is worth the sale price for the entire set.
