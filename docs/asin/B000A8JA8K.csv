I do have the dvd, and agree that the special features and quality are not up to par - however, this is a great movie for anyone who loves horror/comedy.  This movie is better (I think) than the first and I love torch.The acting is never great in any of these, however the story I feel is better than the original as well.  If you liked the original and want to continue with the series, then you will not be disappointed.  However, fair warning the dvds are NOT of the greatest quality as far as features, but the video quality on mine at least is pretty good.",4,Oh come on now!,1189900800,"09 16, 2007",2007,615,"['review', 'movie', 'NOT', 'dvd', 'ITSELF', 'do', 'have', 'dvd', 'agree', 'special', 'features', 'quality', 'are', 'not', 'par', 'however', 'great', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'horror/comedy', 'movie', 'better', 'think', 'first', 'love', 'torch.The', 'acting', 'never', 'great', 'however', 'story', 'feel', 'better', 'original', 'well', 'liked', 'original', 'want', 'continue', 'series', 'then', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'However', 'fair', 'warning', 'dvds', 'are', 'NOT', 'greatest', 'quality', 'as', 'far', 'features', 'video', 'quality', 'mine', 'least', 'pretty', 'good']",Puppet Master II
923899,A2Q5K1G3S8RLWX,B000A8JA8K,"Lunar Strain ""Thrash, don't mind if I do""","[9, 10]","I recently dumped a lot of hard earned money into purchasing the rare out-of-print Puppet Master box set that contains the first 7 films. All the DVDs for the most part have decent picture quality considering what Full Moon Entertainment usually pumps out. Sadly the presentation of ""Puppet Master II"" is really disappointing. The picture is not good at all and is actually no better than the original VHS version. Some portions of the film turn digital for a short time. I might have forgiven the picture quality if the DVD weren't defective. Towards the end of the the picture gets all wavy. It's really annoying and makes the film hard to watch. I at first thought it was my DVD so I purchased another copy from a different seller. Some wavy picture. Every person I talk to says they have the same wavy effect on their DVD. I don't think this poor DVD transfer will be fixed anytime soon because the stock footage used from this film that was edited into Curse of the Puppet Master contanins the same annoying wavy effect. The box set would have been worth it if it weren't for the crappy presentation of Puppet Master II. If your willing to forgive the defective wavy picture, then by all means buy the box set. Otherwise...you've been warned.Update 5/2/06: I did find it most almost humerous that I've been getting a lot of bad feedback on this review by sellers. They are just upset that I pointed out problems with the DVD to warn potential buyers because they want outragous prices for the film. My point is not to help sellers sell the DVD at high prices but to warn potential buyers so they aren't surprised and disappointed by the DVD like I was.",1,Terrible DVD presentation,1144540800,"04 9, 2006",2006,1657,"['recently', 'dumped', 'lot', 'hard', 'earned', 'money', 'purchasing', 'rare', 'out-of-print', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'box', 'set', 'first', '7', 'films', 'DVDs', 'most', 'part', 'have', 'decent', 'picture', 'quality', 'considering', 'what', 'Full', 'Moon', 'Entertainment', 'usually', 'out', 'Sadly', 'presentation', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'II', 'really', 'disappointing', 'picture', 'not', 'good', 'actually', 'better', 'original', 'VHS', 'version', 'portions', 'film', 'turn', 'digital', 'short', 'time', 'might', 'have', 'forgiven', 'picture', 'quality', 'DVD', 'were', ""n't"", 'defective', 'end', 'picture', 'wavy', 'really', 'annoying', 'film', 'hard', 'watch', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'DVD', 'purchased', 'copy', 'different', 'seller', 'wavy', 'picture', 'Every', 'person', 'talk', 'have', 'same', 'wavy', 'effect', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'poor', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'will', 'be', 'fixed', 'anytime', 'soon', 'stock', 'footage', 'used', 'film', 'was', 'edited', 'Curse', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'same', 'annoying', 'wavy', 'effect', 'box', 'set', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'were', ""n't"", 'crappy', 'presentation', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'II', 'willing', 'forgive', 'defective', 'wavy', 'picture', 'then', 'means', 'buy', 'box', 'set', 'Otherwise', ""'ve"", 'been', 'warned.Update', '5/2/06', 'did', 'find', 'most', 'almost', 'humerous', ""'ve"", 'been', 'getting', 'lot', 'bad', 'feedback', 'review', 'sellers', 'are', 'just', 'upset', 'pointed', 'out', 'problems', 'DVD', 'warn', 'potential', 'buyers', 'want', 'outragous', 'prices', 'film', 'point', 'not', 'help', 'sellers', 'sell', 'DVD', 'high', 'prices', 'warn', 'potential', 'buyers', 'are', ""n't"", 'surprised', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'was']",Puppet Master II
923900,A2W3HLHIA9UP4D,B000A8JA8K,The Piper at the Gates,"[0, 1]","Having rather enjoyed the first Puppet Master, I hoped that this first sequel would continue to entertain. Sadly, this film simply wasn't that good. Just like all of these films, I knew not to expect too much as far as story, acting, and overall DVD quality. And all three of those were worse the second time around. The story, though not too bad, wasn't as good. The film picks up sometime after the first film, in which some paranormal investigators visit the Hotel where the puppet murders took place in order to find some answers to what really happened. Needless to say, its the puppets that find them, and murder and mayhem ensues. However, this time, the original puppet master, Andre Toulon, is dug up and brought back to life by his puppets. Of course, the story is bit far-fetched, but what can one expect from a movie like this? This film also introduces a new puppet named Torch, which is pretty cool. Again, the special effects aren't the greatest, but to be a low budget, independent movie, they were ok. What did bother about this film was the audio. The speaking parts were alright, but the sound effects sounded like they were recorded from inside a giant tin can or something; a lot of echo on almost everything from footsteps to gunshots. The acting, or the lack thereof, was pretty bad. The acting was too contrived, too stiff, or seemed too scripted out most of time. And the ending of the film was, though kinda clever, was pretty dumb. Overall, this isn't that great of a movie, however, if you're wanted to watch and/or own all of the films in the Puppet Master series, I suppose you'll have to tough your way through this one.",2,2.5 Stars:  A step down from the first film,1194220800,"11 5, 2007",2007,1651,"['Having', 'rather', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'hoped', 'first', 'sequel', 'would', 'continue', 'entertain', 'Sadly', 'film', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'Just', 'films', 'knew', 'not', 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'far', 'story', 'acting', 'overall', 'DVD', 'quality', 'three', 'were', 'worse', 'second', 'time', 'around', 'story', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'film', 'up', 'sometime', 'first', 'film', 'paranormal', 'investigators', 'visit', 'Hotel', 'where', 'puppet', 'murders', 'took', 'place', 'order', 'find', 'answers', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'Needless', 'say', 'puppets', 'find', 'murder', 'mayhem', 'ensues', 'However', 'time', 'original', 'puppet', 'master', 'Andre', 'Toulon', 'dug', 'up', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'puppets', 'course', 'story', 'bit', 'far-fetched', 'what', 'can', 'one', 'expect', 'movie', 'film', 'also', 'new', 'puppet', 'named', 'Torch', 'pretty', 'cool', 'Again', 'special', 'effects', 'are', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'be', 'low', 'budget', 'independent', 'movie', 'were', 'ok.', 'What', 'did', 'bother', 'film', 'was', 'audio', 'speaking', 'parts', 'were', 'alright', 'sound', 'effects', 'sounded', 'were', 'recorded', 'giant', 'tin', 'can', 'something', 'lot', 'echo', 'almost', 'everything', 'footsteps', 'gunshots', 'acting', 'lack', 'thereof', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'acting', 'was', 'too', 'contrived', 'too', 'stiff', 'seemed', 'too', 'scripted', 'out', 'most', 'time', 'ending', 'film', 'was', 'kinda', 'clever', 'was', 'pretty', 'dumb', 'Overall', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'however', ""'re"", 'wanted', 'watch', 'and/or', 'own', 'films', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'series', 'suppose', ""'ll"", 'have', 'tough', 'way', 'one']",Puppet Master II
