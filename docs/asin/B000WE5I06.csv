Tohru, the main character, is exactly that personality.That being said I do have to admit it was funny but there were few ""belly laughs"". It was enjoyable but not an ""anime find"" that I'll talk to others about.In addition it isn't the kind of anime that makes you eager to watch the next episode.You don't mind watching it but you're not staying up until your eyes bleed from lack of sleep because you ""have to"" see what happens next.I gave it 4 stars because it was better than OK... but still... I would say more like 3.5 stars...I can't think of anything to compare this anime to. It's like a reverse harem anime where a girls is the center and men are her harem.Also there are some strangely feminine male characters. Momeeji being one who is all cuddly cute but is a boy who wears girls close (earrings and all).Would I buy it again after seeing it?

1108845,A1WX42M589VAMQ,B000WE5I06,Mir,"[11, 11]","I'm nearly fifty, and I can tell you that if you are female and have some ""young-at-heartness"" about you, you can LOVE this anime series.This looks to qualify as a reverse harem situation (one main female protagonist with two to several possible suitor/protective male characters). As in other reverse harem tales, the female is a catalyst for the emotional growth of the males, a feminine nucleus of insight that changes the world of those around her. In this one, Tohru is just such a character--a generous, guileless, industrious, uncomplaining, highly optimistic orphan who refuses to let her woes become a burden to anyone if she can help it. Her memories of her mother make her want to be the best she can be. Bit by bit, she learns to rely on others, which is hard for her, even as she shows others about their own ""remarkable"" qualities and uniqueness. She is so compassionate, that her own ability to show caring and mercy will, we assume, one day lift this terrible curse.There are many ""ooh aww"" moments, when we feel our hearts touched by the sorrows and vulnerabilities of these characters, and I was entranced. I reverted emotionally to the fragile, but vibrant times of being young and insecure and afraid, but also eager to learn and grow. It's a lovely series.So, what is it about. Other reviewers have covered it well: A pretty teen gal who is temporarily living on a tent in the woods due to her family home being renovated and her being unwilling to burden her two best friends with her presence for weeks, well, she comes into contact with a remarkable set of males living in a constantly-being-wrecked (and comically so) home. The males are part of a clan that includes a curse related to the Asian zodiac (you know, rat, horse, dog, etc). When embraced by a female, the males who are cursed transform into their animal forms. Poof! She is invited to stay with them to live, as her tent collapses due to the ground being weak and rain-sodden.In this home live the rat (silver-haired Yuki, an adored-from-afar prince archetype, super-pretty and able to charm whomever he chooses with his looks), the dark-haired dog (Shigure, an adult male novelist who likes to wisecrack and be melodramatic, but who also tends to be in the middle of the shenanigans between rat and cat), and red-headed Kyo the Cat, an animal tricked in folklore into being left out of the zodiac due to the rat's ancient trickery.The animosity between rat and cat is ongoing and a main part of the narrative drive. Tohru, who cares for them both, wants to see them develop something more than constant fighting/arguing/enmity.As expected, there is pressure from a ""villainous"" character in the form of clan leader/God Akito and comedy in the gender-bending tradition (a seemingly bisexual brother, as well as other yaoi situations; a cross-dressing relative, a cute-boy archetype, a somber dark-haired male of secret power, etc). There are plenty of school scenes, where the cursed boys and Tohru and her misfit pals (the former gang-girl, the ""electric"" psychic goth gal) have to try to get along with those who adore them or hold them in contempt. (Prince Yuki even has a fan club.)The storylines that show us the background of haunted Hatori the melancholy doctor and the dread secret of Kyo the Cat were heartbreaking and made me cry, but also uplifting in the healing that Tohru could bring to such woeful characters. On the lighter side, the episode with the visit of the cute rabbit-Momiji loli-boy that includes Yuki in a girly dress was quite funny. As was the one where Tohru's friends visit and transformational mayhem ensues as they keep accidentally embracing the boys.Tohru, the impossibly sweet and adorable girl who can heal with her goodness, is much better voiced in the Japanese, as is Ayame, Yuki's flamboyantly narcissistic brother. In the English, Ayame sounds like a mocking version of a gay man. It's not the pleasantest voice acting bit. Momiji is also much cuter in the Japanese. I did like the voices of Kyo and Yuki in the English and Shigure is less over-the-top in English, too, which I prefer.This is a series that makes you want to be a better person to others, more accepting, and that's a good lesson for the young. It also makes you want to hold your head up despite woes and tribulations. To work hard and be stoic, but not excessively so that your friends aren't allowed to aid you. It has good lessons, excellent animation, delightful humor, romance, mystery, touching scenes, nice music, and magic.The manga continued way past the point of this series, and I've read there will not be more anime (ie, to show the rest of the story.) If you want to know how it ends (ie, is the curse lifted, and who will get Tohru), the manga is available to read free online. Just google it up.A big thumbs up for the anime of Fruits Basket.",5,"Sweet, Romantic, Heart-warming, Full of Inspirational ""Morals"", and Funny, too!

1108846,AFV2584U13XP3,B000WE5I06,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[0, 0]","Again this is one of the few early animes sets that I got that wasn't based on Mecha or action-packed battle scenes in it, but this series was a incredible find for me and I have not regretted it.  The series storyline surrounds the Soma family and a tragic curse they have, certain members of their family either boys or girls are cursed at birth to transform into the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac plus the cat for some unknown reason why the Soma family has this curse isn't really explained it's still interesting to see.  Than you have the three characters the series mostly focus on Toru Honda a high school student who recently lost her mother and was camping on the Soma's family backyard since at the time she had no other family to really turned to and didn't want to inconvenience her friends, Yuki Soma(Who turns into the rat)is the  popular prince at the school he and Toru go to and also discovers Toru living on the family's ground and decides to help settle her into their family home, and finally Kyo Soma(Who turns into the cat but also has a more darker secret)has an all assuming need to beat Yuki as he has never been able to do so far.  The series mostly has to due with Toru adjusting to the unusual family and starting to develop feelings for both Kyo and Yuki whether or not there romantic is up to the viewer, but as the series progresses the feelings of friendship and family between the three grows greatly.  The series does have a darker undertone especially with the Soma curse but most of the series is nicely family oriented.  There are some dramatic episodes of course with inner story lines about family, friendship, loyalty, and true love for someone that are truly heartwarming to watch.  The video is full-screen but very clear no lines or distortions to worry over, and the audio is great the Japanese cast are superb and the choice for the English cast is right on the money.  So to fans who looking for a great series filled with drama, family loyalties, and true friendships this is the one for your collection.
