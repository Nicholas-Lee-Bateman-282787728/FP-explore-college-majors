341037,A20LY8E9NGYA4M,6302859727,Alejandro Cortes,"[3, 3]","""This Boy's Life"" is based on the autobiographical novel by Tobias Wolff. The movie follows the story of the young boy Toby ""Jack"" Wolff (Leonardo DiCaprio), a rebel boy who seems to dislike every school and every town that he is in. His mother Caroline (Ellen Barkin), an attractive single woman, keeps searching for a decent man that would take care of her and her son. She finally seems to know the One, when she meets Dwight Hansen (Robert De Niro), a respectful guy. But after a few months living with him, Caroline and Jack realize that Dwight is a bully with a strong need to dominate every one around him. So now things get difficult to both of them.""This Boy's Life"" is a charming drama with strong performances by the great Robert De Niro and the attractive Ellen Barkin, but Leonardo DiCaprio steals the show from them; I actually think that he was a better actor when he was younger, he is good now, but in this movie and in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" he was brilliant.Anyway, ""This Boy's Life"" is an enjoyable film. If you like De Niro's work, DiCaprio's work or Ellen Barkin's work, then you should see this one.",4,THIS BOY'S CHARMING MOVIE.,1058832000,"07 22, 2003",2003,1129,"['Boy', 'Life', 'based', 'autobiographical', 'novel', 'Tobias', 'Wolff', 'movie', 'story', 'young', 'boy', 'Toby', 'Jack', 'Wolff', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'rebel', 'boy', 'who', 'dislike', 'school', 'town', 'mother', 'Caroline', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'attractive', 'single', 'woman', 'searching', 'decent', 'man', 'would', 'take', 'care', 'son', 'finally', 'know', 'One', 'when', 'Dwight', 'Hansen', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'respectful', 'guy', 'few', 'months', 'living', 'Caroline', 'Jack', 'realize', 'Dwight', 'bully', 'strong', 'need', 'dominate', 'one', 'So', 'now', 'things', 'get', 'difficult', 'Boy', 'Life', 'charming', 'drama', 'strong', 'performances', 'great', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'attractive', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'show', 'actually', 'think', 'was', 'better', 'actor', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'good', 'now', 'movie', 'What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'was', 'brilliant.Anyway', 'Boy', 'Life', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'like', 'De', 'Niro', 'work', 'DiCaprio', 'work', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'work', 'then', 'should', 'see', 'one']",This Boys Life VHS

She starts dating &#34;Dwight&#34; (Robert DeNiro), who seems like a nice guy who wants to marry her. She accepts, and both mother and son move into his house, that has three of his kids and is in a rotten little town that has nothing in it to do. After they're married, Dwight's mask comes off and he's actually an SOB.  He likes nothing better than to boss his family around, getting physical and handing out punishments, with an air about him of being a good husband and father.  The wife is turned against him on their wedding night. DeCaprio is picked on constantly. He is a high-spirited teenager, who can sing all the songs on the radio, do imitations, and is a likeable kid.  Knowing his only chance for a reasonable life is to get into a good college, he concentrates on the challenge with everything seeming to be blocking his way.

Robert DeNiro is perfect as the very crude, sometimes funny, but mostly mean step-father.  That he can play diverse roles with such conviction is amazing.  Saint or sinner, he is always believable. The film captures the late 50's era and the precarious situation of a savvy, wily and very witty teen boy and his divorced & striving working mom realistically...and their journey to what the mother thinks will be a better life.  There are both frightening and hilarious incidents...also, much courage and bravery.  Ellen Barkin and Leonardo DeCaprio are excellent...so true and believable in their roles.  I was rooting for them all the way.  The movie led me to read the book, which then led me to read another book by the author's older brother, who went to live with the father rather than the mother and his harrowing experiences.  This film should be seen by all troubled teens..I also see it as a warning to women with children who find themselves with an abusive partner.  My only criticism is the implication that anyone who stays in a small town like Concrete and works in a factory or with their hands is a loser (not everyone can become a writer/teacher)...the important thing is that one can eventually escape and free oneself from a bad homelife or situation and not let it or other set backs ruin one's future or whole life.",5,"A+++++Film, Great Story & Actors,",1171238400,"02 12, 2007",2007,1416,"['one', 'film', 'superior', 'book', 'like', 'book', 'too', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'perfect', 'very', 'crude', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'mostly', 'mean', 'step-father', 'can', 'play', 'diverse', 'roles', 'such', 'conviction', 'amazing', 'Saint', 'sinner', 'always', 'believable', 'film', 'late', '50', 'era', 'precarious', 'situation', 'savvy', 'wily', 'very', 'witty', 'teen', 'boy', 'divorced', 'striving', 'working', 'mom', 'realistically', 'journey', 'what', 'mother', 'thinks', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'life', 'are', 'frightening', 'hilarious', 'incidents', 'also', 'much', 'courage', 'bravery', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'Leonardo', 'DeCaprio', 'are', 'excellent', 'so', 'true', 'believable', 'roles', 'was', 'rooting', 'way', 'movie', 'led', 'read', 'book', 'then', 'led', 'read', 'book', 'author', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'went', 'live', 'father', 'rather', 'mother', 'harrowing', 'experiences', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'troubled', 'teens..I', 'also', 'see', 'warning', 'women', 'children', 'who', 'find', 'abusive', 'partner', 'only', 'criticism', 'implication', 'anyone', 'who', 'small', 'town', 'Concrete', 'factory', 'hands', 'loser', 'not', 'everyone', 'can', 'become', 'writer/teacher', 'important', 'thing', 'one', 'can', 'eventually', 'escape', 'free', 'bad', 'homelife', 'situation', 'not', 'let', 'other', 'set', 'backs', 'ruin', 'one', 'future', 'whole', 'life']",This Boys Life VHS
341042,A2X17SA4E8V3PU,6302859727,Bstrassell0001,"[0, 0]","As most people agree, some with faith and others secularly, there is a way out of our troubles, trials, and even tragedies. Yet it's so hard to find that way out much of the time; don't you agree?All of this having just been said, This Boy's Life is a beautiful reminder that there really is a way out of the troubles, trials, and tragedies of this world, a personal testimony of someone who knew all three--and came out better than he was before (Note: Tobias Wolff's memoir of the same name reveals more hope young ""Toby"" found after the hardest stage of his life was over, some--not all, but some--of which is omitted from the film.) For some of us, this story speaks personal volumes, and reminds us of the hope we have not yet found and still clinging to, or the hope which delivered us long ago.And even if you have no personal connection to the story of This Boy's Life, there's a fun hitch involved: we see Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro ""get in the ring"" together! It's extraordinarily special today, compared to when it first happened, because now ""Leo"" and ""Bobby"" share the same honor with Harvey Keitel: they are the three most frequent moles of Martin Scorsese! Scorsese said last year that he plans on reuniting the two golden actors (""It's my dream and I'm going to make it happen,"" to quote the man himself), and many of the same principles to Scorsese films--anger, tragedy, triumph, and hope--are ***all*** to be found in the very original DiCaprio-De Niro collaboration: which, by the way, was DiCaprio's very first starring role!It is in this role where DiCaprio portrays one of literature's most beloved college professors and storytellers: the previously mentioned Tobias ""Toby"" Wolff, who, at a very young age, became estranged from his father and older brother Geoffrey (note: the film fictionally depicts Geoffrey's name as Gregory). With his mother Caroline (portrayed by Ellen Barkin), young Toby got to travel across the country, receive a beloved Winchester rifle from his mother's stalkerish boyfriend Roy (portrayed by Chris Cooper), and become a  ""juvenile delinquent"" who cut school and vandalized its property, among many other outrageous, degenerative acts. Sadly, Caroline was left to deal with this degeneracy herself, her young son being without a fatherly example and trying ""to drive me into an early grave,"" as Caroline/Barkin say(s) in one scene of the film (note: I cannot remember her exact words, but they were either exactly that or 99.99% close to the previously mentioned sentence.)This all changed--yes, in real life and the film alike--when Caroline met Dwight (De Niro). Dwight was a single father to two daughters and one son yet, despite that, knew how to charm the pants off any young woman (as far as the film is concerned--Tobias Wolff's memoir reveals a far different Dwight!)! When Dwight first met/meets Toby, he shows such a great interest in the young man that he invites him to participate in a ""turkey shoot""--and offers to be the father Toby doesn't have, to show Toby the fatherly correction and love that he so desperately needs.In the end, the only thing that turns--and turned--out to be sincere was Dwight wanting to show Toby correction: correction in the forms of passive aggression and even, many times (more in the book than in the film), physical abuse. Worst of all, there was no one to lift Toby up out from the pits: Caroline, seeking desperately to avoid single motherhood again, submits herself to Dwight and lets him have his way, even when it is not in the best interests of her son (note: read the book and you will see that this was not always the case). Blend all this together, and you have just as much suspense as you have drama!Compared to the memoir version of This Boy's Life, much of the film adaptation is fictionalized: but not entirely. Some of the depth from the memoir is missing--like why Toby moved in with Dwight when he was so miserable with the idea--and details such as, was Toby telling a partial or full lie when he said he didn't impersonate Dwight (we see him do it for only one scene, which fails to give us our answer, though the real Toby reveals it in his memoir.)? Having mentioned that, however, This Boy's Life has far more strengths than weaknesses, and that comes into play with the impersonation scene: it's a RIOT to watch Leonardo DiCaprio impersonate Robert De Niro! It is truly a shame that neither DiCaprio nor De Niro received Academy Award or Golden Globe nominations for their performances: This Boy's Life shows them at their very, very best, bringing to life the hope that Tobias Wolff's memoir reveals. Yes, there are great clouds of doubt that De Niro brings into this hope--after all, he plays the real-life antagonist--but his role is still pivotal in that it proves, once again, that evil can be very easily turned flat on its head--and used for redemption.This Boy's Life is, by far, a must-see film.",4,"An entertaining, hopeful film",1388707200,"01 3, 2014",2014,4939,"['most', 'people',

Ad...","[1, 1]","If I had just one reason to tell you to rent this, it would be to watch this for the sheer joy of seeing Leonardo DiCaprio in his younger years, showing off his acting chops.That being said, it is also fascinating to watch this because Deniro plays one hell of a miserable warped bastard with a bad temper.  It seems his goal in life is to  make everyone as miserable as he is.His character enjoys being a macho man, even if deep down inside, he is a hardly a man at all.While he enjoys making others miserable, his main focus is DiCaprio's character.This is based on a memoir and after viewing the movie I could not believe the author lived through this kind of life.The movie is a tribute to the resilience of the human spirit.The fact that it is a period piece( the movie starts in the 50's) is also a pleasure to watch, along with the songs of the era being played in the film's soundtrack.After the movie I had to go online and read up on the author of this  memoir.You may find yourself just as interested to see what becomes of a boy that loves his  mother so dearly, that he always agrees to go along with her wishes just to make her happy.Wishes that he often knows are going to end up being nothing but heartache- for both of them.The mother is played by Ellen Barkin, who fits very well into the role of a lovely and attractive single Mom of the 50's.One who has resigned herself to another bad decision she has made.She can do far better than Deniro- but she feels stuck and since the truth is that  she *is* stuck, so is Dicaprio.This is the first movie I have seen of DiCaprio as a youngster, before he hit the 'Titanic' wave of fame.Deniro has played bad guys over the course of his movie career but nothing quite like this.I would consider it a character study between DiCaprio and Deniro because their characters are complete opposites and yet they are a constant presence to one another, which makes what Dicaprio has to endure unavoidable.This is a  true human interest story - a film that shows Dicaprio had great acting ability in him, even at a young age. It has Deniro & Barkin together and a superb glance back into the 1950's era.These are just a few good reasons to consider viewing this movie.",4,Great period piece- true story- great acting,1366329600,"04 19, 2013",2013,2220,"['had', 'just', 'one', 'reason', 'tell', 'rent', 'would', 'be', 'watch', 'sheer', 'joy', 'seeing', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'younger', 'years', 'showing', 'off', 'acting', 'chops.That', 'being', 'said', 'also', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'Deniro', 'one', 'hell', 'miserable', 'warped', 'bastard', 'bad', 'temper', 'goal', 'life', 'make', 'everyone', 'as', 'miserable', 'character', 'being', 'macho', 'man', 'even', 'deep', 'inside', 'hardly', 'man', 'making', 'others', 'miserable', 'main', 'focus', 'DiCaprio', 'character.This', 'based', 'memoir', 'viewing', 'movie', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'author', 'lived', 'kind', 'life.The', 'movie', 'tribute', 'resilience', 'human', 'spirit.The', 'fact', 'period', 'piece', 'movie', '50', 'also', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'songs', 'era', 'being', 'played', 'film', 'soundtrack.After', 'movie', 'had', 'go', 'online', 'read', 'up', 'author', 'memoir.You', 'may', 'find', 'just', 'as', 'interested', 'see', 'what', 'boy', 'mother', 'so', 'dearly', 'always', 'go', 'along', 'wishes', 'just', 'make', 'happy.Wishes', 'often', 'are', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'nothing', 'heartache-', 'them.The', 'mother', 'played', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'who', 'very', 'well', 'role', 'lovely', 'attractive', 'single', 'Mom', ""50's.One"", 'who', 'resigned', 'bad', 'decision', 'made.She', 'can', 'do', 'far', 'better', 'Deniro-', 'stuck', 'truth', '*is*', 'stuck', 'so', 'Dicaprio.This', 'first', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'DiCaprio', 'youngster', 'hit', ""'Titanic"", 'wave', 'fame.Deniro', 'played', 'bad', 'guys', 'course', 'movie', 'career', 'nothing', 'quite', 'this.I', 'would', 'consider', 'character', 'study', 'DiCaprio', 'Deniro', 'characters', 'are', 'complete', 'opposites', 'yet', 'are', 'constant', 'presence', 'one', 'what', 'Dicaprio', 'endure', 'unavoidable.This', 'true', 'human', 'interest', 'story', 'film', 'Dicaprio', 'had', 'great', 'acting', 'ability', 'even', 'young', 'age', 'Deniro', 'Barkin', 'together', 'superb', 'glance', 'back', '1950', 'era.These', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'good', 'reasons', 'consider', 'viewing', 'movie']",This Boys Life VHS

When it came out, I had never heard of Leonardo DiCaprio, but I wasn't alone as this was only his second or third time on screen. Anyway, he certainly gave a powerful performance and served notice he was going to be a ""big name"" actor.Basically, it's about teenage kid and his mom trying to survive the mean father-husband of the family in a small town during the 1950s. Robert De Niro plays the dad and Ellen Barkin, the mom.Leo plays ""Tobias Wolffe;"" De Niro, ""Dwight Hansen"" and Barkin, ""Caroline Hansen.""

This highly dramatic movie contains many shocking scenes that may become eye openers to some.  Such intensity keeps the audience closely watching every second.  The extreme of it forces the audience to feel what every character feels.  More than just the excellent screenplay writing acts out this task.  The cast and crew brilliantly perform their roles.Every actor assists with the audience impacts with their wonderful performances.  No one holds back a drop of emotion from their characters.  Robert De Niro wonderfully plays a child abuser.  Though few will like the character, he'll be remembered by many.  Leonardo DiCaprio and Ellen Barkin brilliantly play the victims.

It is an author's childhood memoir about a boy that has a very intimate friendship-type relationship with his mother and is abandoned by his father, then goes to live with and be raised by another man - though, Dwight, here, was less certifiably nuts and more of a just plain mean father-figure. In both these films the focus and strength of the movie is not in story or plot so much as the characters and relationships.I just watched Taxi Driver and was amazed at a young Jodi Foster's ability to match the charisma and acting excellence of De Niro and captivate your attention in scenes with him. I could see This Boy's Life having been a much different film if it were cast (years earlier) with Matt Damon or even if Tobey Maguire, who has a bit part in this movie, had swapped roles with DiCaprio. DiCaprio (as Toby, the boy in the movie) just did not have the acting depth to propel an otherwise very good film into movie greatness. De Niro dominates in this film, and the scenes he was in were by far the most gripping. It was unclear through most of the film whether his strictness was driven by a motivation for Toby to fufill his potential or whether Dwight was just using the boy as a scapegoat for his own feelings of inadequecy and powerlessness.

And that says a lot because he has been in so many good ones. But his acting here is so incredibly good. His Canadian sounding accent is so great. His ability to contort his facial expressions to match almost any circumstance is masterful.  The movie is based on a true story of Tobias Wolff and how he grew up in a small town called Concrete and lived with his mom and his abusive father.  The abuse was both physical and mental and in the end he is able to get out of town thanks to his ability to game the system somewhat and get into college.  I highly recommend this movie.

I tend to carry a copy of this movie around with me now in the hopes that I'll find a video player, that is how intense my feelings are for this particular movie. I have also read Tobias Wolff's autobiography on which this movie was based, and I have got to say that the movie outshines even the book! A rare thing indeed!Never have I seen better acting than that which is performed by DiCaprio and De Niro in this particular movie. They are a stunning team, work brilliantly together, and truly bring the effect of the relationship between Jack (Tobias) and his step-father home to the audience. If this movie doesn't make you cry, nothing will! The film industry needs to put out more movies like this more regularly. Nothing can compare to a great movie with a lot of heart that shows, ultimately *reality*. &quot;This Boy's Life&quot; does just that where many, many others have failed. Brilliant acting by DiCaprio, De Niro and Barkin and outstanding directing make this one to own and to treasure.",5,Real.

341079,AXVKMYWNIHK7W,6302859727,"Terri ""3kids-at-home""","[1, 1]","This is a true story about Tobias Wolffe. He is a boy who's mother is raising him alone, and he spends most of his days with his buddies, and getting into trouble while she's at work. His mother doesn't know what else to do with him, so she marries a man, whom she feels would be a good example to him. This is when she decides to send poor Tobias to stay with her new boyfriend to see if he can straighten him out (prior to their marriage). He is very strict, and down right mean to Tobias, but is always nice his mother. Finally, when Tobias' mother gets married to this man, he becomes more violent, and controlling to them both. Tobias still skips school to hang out with his buddies, and gets into trouble. Now Tobias decides after a few years of being tortured by his step-father, with beatings, and mind controlling, that he wants to go to a boarding school college, and his step-father tries to dicourage him, because he's jealous that he might succeed in life, and not be controlled by him anymore. They get into a mondo arguement, and it all comes to a head in the end. I won't tell you the rest. You have to see it yourself. Just a fair warning, this movie is good, but has a lot of cursing, and a violent sex scene between Tobias' mother and step-father on their wedding night, not appropriate for children under 14.",4,This Boy's life,1217203200,"07 28, 2008",2008,1328,"['true', 'story', 'Tobias', 'Wolffe', 'boy', 'who', 'mother', 'raising', 'alone', 'most', 'days', 'buddies', 'getting', 'trouble', 'work', 'mother', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'else', 'do', 'man', 'whom', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'example', 'when', 'send', 'poor', 'Tobias', 'stay', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'see', 'can', 'straighten', 'out', 'prior', 'marriage', 'very', 'strict', 'down', 'right', 'mean', 'Tobias', 'always', 'nice', 'mother', 'Finally', 'when', 'Tobias', 'mother', 'married', 'man', 'more', 'violent', 'controlling', 'Tobias', 'still', 'school', 'hang', 'out', 'buddies', 'trouble', 'Now', 'Tobias', 'decides', 'few', 'years', 'being', 'tortured', 'step-father', 'beatings', 'mind', 'controlling', 'go', 'boarding', 'school', 'college', 'step-father', 'tries', 'dicourage', 'jealous', 'might', 'succeed', 'life', 'not', 'be', 'controlled', 'anymore', 'get', 'mondo', 'arguement', 'head', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'rest', 'have', 'see', 'Just', 'fair', 'warning', 'movie', 'good', 'lot', 'cursing', 'violent', 'sex', 'scene', 'Tobias', 'mother', 'step-father', 'wedding', 'night', 'not', 'appropriate', 'children', '14']",This Boys Life VHS
