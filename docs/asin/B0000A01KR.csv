His selections are diverse; for the time in which it was filmed, before his cd Harmony. His voice becomes more rich as the years pass, and this should be on the shelf of all Gordon Lightfoot fans.",5,Gordon - Always First Class,1328486400,"02 6, 2012",2012,292,"['Having', 'seen', 'Gordon', 'Lightfoot', 'concert', 'several', 'times', 'can', 'say', 'excellent', 'dvd', 'selections', 'are', 'diverse', 'time', 'was', 'filmed', 'cd', 'Harmony', 'voice', 'more', 'rich', 'years', 'pass', 'should', 'be', 'shelf', 'Gordon', 'Lightfoot', 'fans']",N/A

760470,A3NIU8O31SVXP7,B0000A01KR,Hedley Lamarr,"[4, 4]","A couple of complaints that I have read is - Why didn't he do this sooner as his voice is weak - Well, just be glad he did it when he did(I believe the performance was in 2000, and originally released in 2002 as Reno concert and re issued as live in 2003) I saw him in concert in 2011, and then I bought this DVD. Well he has had a lot of health problems since this dvd was released, so I am glad he did it in 2000, as his voice is even weaker now - However, it is still a great dvd and he has a great voice. True he was in his 60's when this was done, and sometimes the voice goes, or gets weaker which is the case in Lightfoot, but his performance still kicks butt.  This is the same DVD as the Reno Concert (you are correct that for some reason one was released in 2002 and the other 2003 but it is same with this one being the cheapest).  If you have several of his albums, and love his music, I do not think you will be disappointed. He does 20 songs. 2/3 of the songs are considered his hits. Several people complained no track list was mentioned. I do not have the list before me, but I will try to list what I remember (please forgive the spelling) 1. The Edmund Fitzgerald 2. IF YOU COULD READ MY MIND (gets a standing ovation for this) 3. Blackberry WINE 4. SUNDOWN 5. CAREFREE HWY 6. RESTLESS 7. RR TRILOGY 8. A WINTERS NIGHT 9. RAINY DAY PEOPLE 10. WHAT YOU GET FOR LOVIN' ME 11. EARLY MORNING RAIN. 12. DON QUITOTEE 13. OLD DAN'S RECORDS 14 A PAINTER PASSING THROUGH 15. SHADOWS 16. COLD ON THE SHOLDER.  THE OTHER FOUR SONGS HE DOES I CANT REMEMBER - He did not do Cotton Jenny, OR IN MY FASHION, OR DREAM STREET ROSE.  I give this 5 solid stars. I am a big fan though, but it is a very good concert and has a good sound. It seemed long enough. Some people said it wasn't long enough, and in most concerts he usually does 25 or 26 songs, but still the lenth was about an hour and 20 min.. No extra's was the only disappointment for me - and I'm not one of the DVD people that believe you have to have extra's to be good. I just wish a quick interview with band members could have been done (no big deal though).",5,Love Love Love this DVD!

I know that he has had some big time health problems lately so I was happy to find this live DVD to watch.  He sounds great and does many of his best songs on it.  Great group backing him up and the picture and sound quality are pretty good.  This guy has written so many great songs that I knew I would want to have this disc just in case I never get to see him again.,5,Great music,1248480000,"07 25, 2009",2009,429,"[""'m"", 'big', 'Lightfoot', 'fan', 'have', 'seen', 'live', 'many', 'times', 'know', 'had', 'big', 'time', 'health', 'problems', 'lately', 'was', 'happy', 'find', 'live', 'DVD', 'watch', 'great', 'many', 'best', 'songs', 'Great', 'group', 'backing', 'up', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'guy', 'written', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'songs', 'knew', 'would', 'want', 'have', 'disc', 'just', 'case', 'never', 'get', 'see', 'again']",N/A
