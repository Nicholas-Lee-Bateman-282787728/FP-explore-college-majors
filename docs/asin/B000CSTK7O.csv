My only exposure to media education re The Black Death is the frighteningly unhygienicFlesh & Bloodand I expected that level of Orson Welles horror at finding himself in postwar Austria filming the Third Man with no food-protecting cellophane in sight.In contrast to the rest of the two hours with commercials if you happen to catch it on the History Channel, is the few minutes starting at 1:14 where the already thoroughly boringly described flagellants torture a Jewish merchant named Agimet passing through Geneva, Switzerland forcing him to confess to causing the plague by poisoning well water which reminds me of the fat zombie in Season 2 of Walking Dead.That first ""confession"" was circulated by the Swiss German flagellants and started participation in 15 ""other German cities"" and in France (named after The Franks) and England of murdering Jewish people. Then in 1349, Poland opened its arms to the Jewish refugees and it would be 600 years later that ""those same Germans"" would come ""full circle"" i.e. invade Poland and attempt to kill all the Jews again. This is in a 2 hour documentary about the Mongolian instigated ""Plague"" which halved the population of Europe in the 14th Century in only a few short years leading Marco Polo to set out to China to recover previously-borrowed intellectual property lost in the Plague. That is why the Roman Army's remains were found in China hundreds of years before Marco Polo and why noodles were found in Italy long before Marco Polo brought back his treasures from the Mongolian-controlled China - which only lasted three generations just as long as their descendants' Mughal Empire in India. Incredible how much harm the marauders can do - those rats began carrying the plague from the slaughters in China such as in Beijing where blood and human tissue and fat COATED buildings three stories high from the Mongolian invaders murders and then it spread with the Mongolians westward where they threw a plague-d corpse over the wall in Italy because the Mongolians failed to breach the Italian fortress and might have been the first incident of biological warfare and that 600 years later (misstated as ""700 years"" by one of the interview subjects of this documentary/reenactment), the ""same tribe of Germans"" would come full circle i.e. invade Poland and try to kill all the Jews once again.p.s.  This documentary fails to mention thatBy authority of Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy, a number of the Jews who lived on the shores of Lake Geneva, having been arrested and put to the torture, naturally confessed anything their inquisitors suggested. These Jews, under torture, incriminated others. Records of their confessions were sent from one town to another in Switzerland and down the Rhine River into Germany, and as a result, thousands of Jews, in at least two hundred towns and hamlets, were butchered and burnt. The sheer loss of numbers, the disappearance of their wealth, and the growing hatred of the Christians brought German Jewry to a catastrophic downfall. It now began to decline and did not again play an important part in German life till the seventeenth century.[...]",3,kinda boring then they tell us about the flagellants' antisemitism which blows the hair back!

962471,A31NCZ7J0ZWYHX,B000CSTK7O,Lev T.,"[19, 28]","This documentary was a major disappointment.  There are massive gaps in telling the story of this dreadful era.  You get a really good idea of how the plague spread, and the sheer level of panic amongst people.  They actually do a brilliant job of this.  The use of contemporary sources is very well done.This documentary had great potential but it falls flat.  It falls flat for two reasons -Firstly, like too many things class is almost totally ignored.  The world of academia has an intense phobia of discussing class.  In the wake of the plague there were massive peasant revolts.  Wat Tyler's revolt isn't even mentioned. The plague affected poorer people much more than nobles.  There is a very small mention of this but I do emphasise small.The most ridiculous thing I found about this documentary was the absence of the mention of cats.  Cats suffered wholesale persecution during this period.  The best anti-rodent control of the ancient world were cats.  The rats were able to spread the disease unchecked.  Instead we get a bizzare tangent about cats and the pnuemonic plague.  It is a tangent because it talks about cats in southern parts of the US.I think the producers of this show have a medieval mentality in regards to the role of cats in society.If you are interested in this era it is still worth a look.",3,There are too many problems with this DVD for it to be great.,1292198400,"12 13, 2010",2010,1323,"['documentary', 'was', 'major', 'disappointment', 'are', 'massive', 'gaps', 'telling', 'story', 'dreadful', 'era', 'get', 'really', 'good', 'idea', 'how', 'plague', 'spread', 'sheer', 'level', 'panic', 'amongst', 'people', 'actually', 'do', 'brilliant', 'job', 'use', 'contemporary', 'sources', 'very', 'well', 'done.This', 'documentary', 'had', 'great', 'potential', 'flat', 'flat', 'two', 'reasons', '-Firstly', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'class', 'almost', 'totally', 'ignored', 'world', 'academia', 'intense', 'phobia', 'discussing', 'class', 'wake', 'plague', 'were', 'massive', 'peasant', 'revolts', 'Wat', 'Tyler', 'revolt', ""n't"", 'even', 'mentioned', 'plague', 'affected', 'poorer', 'people', 'much', 'more', 'nobles', 'very', 'small', 'mention', 'do', 'emphasise', 'small.The', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'thing', 'found', 'documentary', 'was', 'absence', 'mention', 'cats', 'Cats', 'suffered', 'wholesale', 'persecution', 'period', 'best', 'anti-rodent', 'control', 'ancient', 'world', 'were', 'cats', 'rats', 'were', 'able', 'spread', 'disease', 'unchecked', 'Instead', 'get', 'bizzare', 'tangent', 'cats', 'pnuemonic', 'plague', 'tangent', 'cats', 'southern', 'parts', 'US.I', 'think', 'producers', 'show', 'have', 'medieval', 'mentality', 'regards', 'role', 'cats', 'society.If', 'are', 'interested', 'era', 'still', 'worth', 'look']",The Plague

962474,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000CSTK7O,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[43, 43]","The Plague is a very fine documentary by The History Channel; it gives us a great deal of information about the ""Black Death"" or what was probably the bubonic plague that killed up to half of Europe's and Asia's population when it spread uncontrollably in the late 1340s. While this film is extremely educational, there are some not so pretty scenes (the flagellants walking from village to village, for example) that make me want to warn you that small children and sensitive people could be upset by some of the footage. On the other hand, however, it is an excellent telling of the story; and the pace moves along very well. There's lots of time spent to make sure that we really understand what happened and how; things never felt rushed. In addition, the quality of the print is excellent.Some may say that the reenactments of events that occurred during The Plague are overdone or poorly acted but I thought it was all done rather professionally and with great care. I particularly like the way the filmmakers wove together reenactment scenes with interviews with today's scholars who know so much about the illness; and the narration was also done very well. It is through all these things put together that we get the complete story of this outbreak of bubonic plague and how it rushed through so much of the world so fast; and we see how physicians of the day were powerless to cure people of it or prevent it for that matter. We see the flagellant movement gaining strength and then waning in Germany; we learn how the Church was challenged by the devastation and we also learn about wealthy people who tried to escape the plague by fleeing cities for country estates where they were more isolated. In addition, the film covers the blaming of Jews for the plague simply because Jews were not exactly well liked.Of course, there's much more information here than I'm going to give to you, including the prevailing theories of what caused the disease, how the illness spread and the other things desperate people did to try to ward off the plague. I don't want to spoil it for you!Overall, this excellent documentary does a top-notch job; we learn the story of the ""Black Death"" and what happened during its outbreak and after it faded, too. I highly recommend this film for anyone studying this period in history; and people studying how infectious diseases spread in the past as well as how they spread in our times would do well to add this to their collections.",5,"the profound impact of the ""Black Death""",1263513600,"01 15, 2010",2010,2473,"['Plague', 'very', 'fine', 'documentary', 'History', 'Channel', 'great', 'deal', 'information', 'Black', 'Death', 'what', 'was', 'probably', 'bubonic', 'plague', 'killed', 'up', 'half', 'Europe', 'Asia', 'population', 'when', 'spread', 'uncontrollably', 'late', '1340s', 'film', 'extremely', 'educational', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'pretty', 'scenes', 'flagellants', 'walking', 'village', 'village', 'example', 'make', 'want', 'warn', 'small', 'children', 'sensitive', 'people', 'could', 'be', 'upset', 'footage', 'other', 'hand', 'however', 'excellent', 'telling', 'story', 'pace', 'along', 'very', 'well', 'lots', 'time', 'spent', 'make', 'sure', 'really', 'understand', 'what', 'happened', 'how', 'things', 'never', 'felt', 'rushed', 'addition', 'quality', 'print', 'excellent.Some', 'may', 'say', 'reenactments', 'events', 'occurred', 'Plague', 'are', 'overdone', 'poorly', 'acted', 'thought', 'was', 'done', 'rather', 'professionally', 'great', 'care', 'particularly', 'way', 'filmmakers', 'wove', 'together', 'reenactment', 'scenes', 'interviews', 'today', 'scholars', 'who', 'know', 'so', 'much', 'illness', 'narration', 'was', 'also', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'things', 'put', 'together', 'get', 'complete', 'story', 'outbreak', 'bubonic', 'plague', 'how', 'rushed', 'so', 'much', 'world', 'fast', 'see', 'how', 'physicians', 'day', 'were', 'powerless', 'cure', 'people', 'prevent', 'matter', 'see', 'flagellant', 'movement', 'gaining', 'strength', 'then', 'waning', 'Germany', 'learn', 'how', 'Church', 'was', 'challenged', 'devastation', 'also', 'learn', 'wealthy', 'people', 'who', 'tried', 'escape', 'plague', 'fleeing', 'cities', 'country', 'estates', 'where', 'were', 'more', 'isolated', 'addition', 'film', 'blaming', 'Jews', 'plague', 'simply', 'Jews', 'were', 'not', 'exactly', 'well', 'liked.Of', 'course', 'much', 'more', 'information', 'here', ""'m"", 'going', 'give', 'including', 'prevailing', 'theories', 'what', 'caused', 'disease', 'how', 'illness', 'spread', 'other', 'things', 'desperate', 'people', 'did', 'try', 'ward', 'off', 'plague', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'Overall', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'top-notch', 'job', 'learn', 'story', 'Black', 'Death', 'what', 'happened', 'outbreak', 'faded', 'too', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'studying', 'period', 'history', 'people', 'studying', 'how', 'infectious', 'diseases', 'spread', 'past', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'spread', 'times', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'add', 'collections']",The Plague
962475,AD39QGHGWAOPQ,B000CSTK7O,"mwreview ""mwreview""","[2, 3]","""The Plague"" (which is also available as a bonus feature in the History Channel's DVD ""The Dark Ages"") is an entertaining, but lengthy, 90 minute documentary full of reenactments and expert analysis.  It focuses on several events and characters during the Plague, particularly the brilliant French surgeon to Pope Clement VI, Guy de Chauliac, the Flagellant movement, and pogroms against the Jewish people.  The documentary follows several characters in its telling of this watershed event.  Joan, the daughter of King Edward III of England, traveled to Spanish Castile to marry Prince Peter.  Though she was likely the most protected person in Europe, she did not escape the disease (her illness is not depicted in the documentary).  A Jewish trader traveled from Geneva to Venice as the Plague followed his journey.  He was attacked, tortured and forced to confess to poisoning the wells as part of the widespread persecution of the Jewish people. In Strasbourg, France on Valentine's Day 1349, 2,000 Jewish people were burned at the stake.  Many left to find refuge in Poland.  The Plague sparked the zenith of the Flagellant movement with men reenacting the Passion of the Christ causing great commotion and threatening authority wherever they went.The best part of this documentary, for this reviewer, was the information on surgeon Guy de Chauliac.  He did not flee for his safety, but stayed to treat Plague victims (becoming ill himself) so he could study the disease.  Though he was a product of the times, and tried such treatments as fire to protect the Pope, he also used more practical means of treating the disease and used this experience to write ""The Great Surgery"" that was based more on observation than on superstition and theology.The documentary, of course, covers key issues like cause (bubonic plague, pnuemonic plague, even a brief mention of anthrax) and its spread.  As one reviewer mentioned, it does not address the persecution of cats which killed off the main predator of the flea-infested rats.  The exhumation of a mass grave of Plague victims in Montpellier, France where the teeth are studied for clues on the origin of the disease is touched on.  Death statistics, psychological effects in such things as art, the privatization of religion and the turn towards science, the rise in the standard of living for survivors, and the labor shortage which pushed the need for labor-saving innovations are also examined.  This documentary is not comprehensive, of course, but it is still a little lengthy for this reviewer's liking.  Still, it is a nice, entertaining overview of the greatest biological disaster of all time.",4,"""The greatest biological disaster of all time""",1323388800,"12 9, 2011",2011,2653,"['Plague', 'also', 'available', 'bonus', 'feature', 'History', 'Channel', 'DVD', 'Dark', 'Ages', 'entertaining', 'lengthy', '90', 'minute', 'documentary', 'full', 'reenactments', 'expert', 'analysis', 'several', 'events', 'characters', 'Plague', 'particularly', 'brilliant', 'French', 'surgeon', 'Pope', 'Clement', 'VI', 'Guy', 'de', 'Chauliac', 'Flagellant', 'movement', 'pogroms', 'Jewish', 'people', 'documentary', 'several', 'characters', 'telling', 'watershed', 'event', 'Joan', 'daughter', 'King', 'Edward', 'III', 'England', 'traveled', 'Spanish', 'Castile', 'marry', 'Prince', 'Peter', 'was', 'likely', 'most', 'protected', 'person', 'Europe', 'did', 'not', 'escape', 'disease', 'illness', 'not', 'depicted', 'documentary', 'Jewish', 'trader', 'traveled', 'Geneva', 'Venice', 'Plague', 'followed', 'journey', 'was', 'attacked', 'tortured', 'forced', 'confess', 'poisoning', 'wells', 'part', 'widespread', 'persecution', 'Jewish', 'people', 'Strasbourg', 'France', 'Valentine', 'Day', '1349', '2,000', 'Jewish', 'people', 'were', 'burned', 'stake', 'Many', 'left', 'find', 'refuge', 'Poland', 'Plague', 'sparked', 'zenith', 'Flagellant', 'movement', 'men', 'reenacting', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'causing', 'great', 'commotion', 'threatening', 'authority', 'went.The', 'best', 'part', 'documentary', 'reviewer', 'was', 'information', 'surgeon', 'Guy', 'Chauliac', 'did', 'not', 'flee', 'safety', 'stayed', 'treat', 'Plague', 'victims', 'becoming', 'ill', 'could', 'study', 'disease', 'was', 'product', 'times', 'tried', 'such', 'treatments', 'fire', 'protect', 'Pope', 'also', 'used', 'more', 'practical', 'means', 'treating', 'disease', 'used', 'experience', 'write', 'Great', 'Surgery', 'was', 'based', 'more', 'observation', 'superstition', 'theology.The', 'documentary', 'course', 'key', 'issues', 'cause', 'bubonic', 'plague', 'pnuemonic', 'plague', 'even', 'brief', 'mention', 'anthrax', 'spread', 'one', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'not', 'address', 'persecution', 'cats', 'killed', 'off', 'main', 'predator', 'flea-infested', 'rats', 'exhumation', 'mass', 'grave', 'Plague', 'victims', 'Montpellier', 'France', 'where', 'teeth', 'are', 'studied', 'clues', 'origin', 'disease', 'touched', 'Death', 'statistics', 'psychological', 'effects', 'such', 'things', 'art', 'privatization', 'religion', 'turn', 'towards', 'science', 'rise', 'standard', 'living', 'survivors', 'labor', 'shortage', 'pushed', 'need', 'labor-saving', 'innovations', 'are', 'also', 'examined', 'documentary', 'not', 'comprehensive', 'course', 'still', 'little', 'lengthy', 'reviewer', 'liking', 'Still', 'nice', 'entertaining', 'overview', 'greatest', 'biological', 'disaster', 'time']",The Plague

When great and sustained misery is visited upon people, they too often show the worst side of their nature.  In this case the misery was the black plague that killed millions in Europe over a period of about five years.It was blamed, by some, on the convenient Jews, and they were villified and slain for a disease that killed them in the same proportion as non-Jews.  The plague brought about the flagellants, who, in their religious fervor, went around publicly flogging themselves to expiate the sins of mankind and for the entertainment of others.  Much of the misery of the plague was actually increased by the falsely pious Christians who thought the plague was a punishment from an angry God.

962480,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,B000CSTK7O,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[6, 6]","Here's a heads-up: You can actually get this entire 90-minute documentary for free as a special feature on the History Channel's ""Dark Ages"" DVD, a far superior product to this one since ""Dark Ages"" is a far superior production. That's where I viewed ""The Plague"" myself and I must admit I was disappointed. It appears ""The Plague"" was done on the cheap and heavily padded out, extending what should be a 30-minute documentary into an hour and a half of relentlessly depressing imagery and scare tactics designed to attract germophobic viewers. This film might be riveting if you've just survived major surgery and relish seeing images of people worse off than you, but it's pretty slow going otherwise.First, the re-enactments are repetitive and poorly budgeted, with what appear to be the same extras continually coughing up blood with title cards like ""London 1347"" or ""Avignon 1348"" superimposed over scenes which are indistinguishable in their locales from one another. Secondly, the same four or five historical experts keep popping up throughout, adding little that's new. The narrator himself punctuates their intelligent commentary with really stupid and over-simplified claims about medieval Europe in general and medieval Catholicism in particular, using words like ""religion"" and ""superstition"" interchangeably, and overplaying the ignorance of an era in which European culture was actually on the rise. It's like watching history for 5th graders.Thirdly, this film that mocks the alleged brutality and fears of medieval Europe revels in the very same thing, giving us continual images of sadistic Christians punishing themselves and others as they seek a scapegoat (including an unfortunate group of Jews in one case) for the plague while the pope hides in Avignon. Some of these segments, while possessing a grain of truth in history, are downright offensive in their agenda to show how Christianity's ethos of love discredited itself in response to the plague. With a powerful morbidity, the film likewise revels in salacious medical descriptions of the Bubonic plague and what it does to one's body, culminating in fantastical speculations about the likelihood that we will all die very quickly when the first big plague of the globalized era is unleashed. One particular shot depicting the family cat as the possible bearer of humanity's destruction is simultaneously laughable and deplorable in its obvious attempt to frighten viewers. Seriously, there's not a single positive description of medieval life or religion here, nor even a kind word about modern science: It's like we're looking at the world through the lens of Hitler's Germany.Buried under all of this nonsense is some pretty good interview footage with scholars who explain how the plague may or may not have been bubonic, giving us various theories of its cause. There is also the accurate storyline of how the plague spread through rats via Europe's expanding trade routes. There are some good computer map graphics to illustrate the plague's spread, in addition to the requisite footage of rats. It's a shame all of these elements had to be buried in a bargain-rate, relentlessly depressing film like this one. When it comes to home video, there is good History Channel and there is bad History Channel, but this film unfortunately falls into the latter category.",1,"Repetitive, simplistic, grotesque documentary",1392163200,"02 12, 2014",2014,3349,"['Here', 'heads-up', 'can', 'actually', 'get', 'entire', '90-minute', 'documentary', 'free', 'special', 'feature', 'History', 'Channel', 'Dark', 'Ages', 'DVD', 'far', 'superior', 'product', 'one', 'Dark', 'Ages', 'far', 'superior', 'production', 'where', 'viewed', 'Plague', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Plague', 'was', 'done', 'cheap', 'heavily', 'padded', 'out', 'extending', 'what', 'should', 'be', '30-minute', 'documentary', 'hour', 'half', 'relentlessly', 'depressing', 'imagery', 'scare', 'tactics', 'designed', 'attract', 'germophobic', 'viewers', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'riveting', ""'ve"", 'just', 'survived', 'major', 'surgery', 'relish', 'seeing', 'images', 'people', 'worse', 'off', 'pretty', 'slow', 'going', 'otherwise.First', 're-enactments', 'are', 'repetitive', 'poorly', 'budgeted', 'what', 'appear', 'be', 'same', 'extras', 'continually', 'coughing', 'up', 'blood', 'title', 'cards', 'London', '1347', 'Avignon', '1348', 'superimposed', 'scenes', 'are', 'indistinguishable', 'locales', 'one', 'Secondly', 'same', 'four', 'five', 'historical', 'experts', 'keep', 'popping', 'up', 'adding', 'little', 'new', 'narrator', 'intelligent', 'commentary', 'really', 'stupid', 'over-simplified', 'claims', 'medieval', 'Europe', 'general', 'medieval', 'Catholicism', 'particular', 'using', 'words', 'religion', 'superstition', 'interchangeably', 'overplaying', 'ignorance', 'era', 'European', 'culture', 'was', 'actually', 'rise', 'watching', 'history', '5th', 'graders.Thirdly', 'film', 'alleged', 'brutality', 'fears', 'medieval', 'Europe', 'revels', 'very', 'same', 'thing', 'giving', 'continual', 'images', 'sadistic', 'Christians', 'punishing', 'others', 'seek', 'scapegoat', 'including', 'unfortunate', 'group', 'Jews', 'one', 'case', 'plague', 'pope', 'Avignon', 'segments', 'possessing', 'grain', 'truth', 'history', 'are', 'downright', 'offensive', 'agenda', 'show', 'how', 'Christianity', 'ethos', 'love', 'discredited', 'response', 'plague', 'powerful', 'morbidity', 'film', 'likewise', 'revels', 'salacious', 'medical', 'descriptions', 'Bubonic', 'plague', 'what', 'one', 'body', 'culminating', 'fantastical', 'speculations', 'likelihood', 'will', 'die', 'very', 'quickly', 'when', 'first', 'big', 'plague', 'globalized', 'era', 'unleashed', 'One', 'particular', 'shot', 'depicting', 'family', 'cat', 'possible', 'bearer', 'humanity', 'destruction', 'simultaneously', 'laughable', 'deplorable', 'obvious', 'attempt', 'frighten', 'viewers', 'Seriously', 'not', 'single', 'positive', 'description', 'medieval', 'life', 'religion', 'here', 'even', 'kind', 'word', 'modern', 'science', ""'re"", 'looking', 'world', 'lens', 'Hitler', 'Germany.Buried', 'nonsense', 'pretty', 'good', 'interview', 'footage', 'scholars', 'who', 'explain', 'how', 'plague', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'bubonic', 'giving', 'various', 'theories', 'cause', 'also', 'accurate', 'storyline', 'how', 'plague', 'spread', 'rats', 'Europe', 'expanding', 'trade', 'routes', 'are', 'good', 'computer', 'map', 'graphics', 'illustrate', 'plague', 'spread', 'addition', 'requisite', 'footage', 'rats', 'shame', 'elements', 'had', 'be', 'buried', 'bargain-rate', 'relentlessly', 'depressing', 'film', 'one', 'When', 'home', 'video', 'good', 'History', 'Channel', 'bad', 'History', 'Channel', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'latter', 'category']",The Plague
