1047015,A3RTN9YPWMHZ4W,B000MM0LHS,Amazon Customer,"[2, 4]","Many discussions of asian horror and korean horror mention Ryeong (the Ghost); after watching the Tartan Extreme DVD, I can see why.  The plot is 99% formulaic, without any of the flourishes that other k-horror movies add to differentiate themselves.However, this means that it's a perfect specimen to study all the conventions of Korean horror: it covers the usual physical representations, such as the young girl ghost with the long dark hair and the preoccupation with water, but also the deeper cultural issues that differentiate Korean horror from, say, Japanese horror.  These include the search for identity and missing memory; a sense of shame about oneself or one's origins; a high school setting (Korean high schools are notoriously difficult and high-pressure); and a group of girls ganging up and victimizing a weaker girl.The by-the-numbers plot covers all these things as if the director had been working from a checklist. Sadly, it also suffers from the problems that often plague asian horror films, including a paper-thin story and ridiculous non-explanations for key events.If I was just rating Ryeong on the story or thrills, I'd give it a generous two stars and recommend that you look elsewhere for entertainment.

1047020,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B000MM0LHS,Dave. K,"[4, 8]","Asian filmmakers are still trying to milk the ghost story for everything its worth. Over the last couple of years these movies have taken a major downfall. While not horrible it's just the same basic story with different actors.Some have been enjoyable, but more often than not they just aren't working as well. Director Tae-kyeong Kim really doesn't try and offer much of a difference than what has come before.He follows the same basic format of films past, while that did work for a while because it was new and when it started to get a little clich&eacute;d, filmmakers were able to put their own twist on it, but now there isn't much that can be done differently you just hope the movie can be entertaining.The Ghost really isn't a bad movie it's just we have seen it done before and seen it done better. Tae-kyeong Kim manages to put together some solid suspenseful moments, but again it just suffers from being too much of a rehash.The concept while clich&eacute;d was interesting, but it just came out too slow paced and not enough set up on the story. The characters were interesting, but they just didn't have enough of a well drawn out plot.The Ghost can be quite slow at times and the script was rather weak; when it came down to suspense it sort of works, but I already explained why it doesn't totally work. The scares are predictable, but some work well and others come out decent.The scene in the movie theater was an excellent and creepy scene and showed the potential The Ghost had. There were other moments like that that help The Ghost come out a little better than maybe it should have.The final act was a bit weak; obviously you know there is gonna be some kind of twist there always seems to be. The twist was alright and not too confusing, but it just doesn't seem to work.If you aren't sick of the Asian ghost flick The Ghost might be worth watching; for the rest check it out at your own risk. For those new to these movies The Ghost will probably deliver, but you can do better.In closing, The Ghost really isn't a bad movie by any means. The acting is pretty good, but the script is weak and while there are some suspenseful moments it's just the same movie we have seen plenty of times.

Ji-won's old friends are mysteriously dying, and, as her memory returns, Ji-won begins to experience haunting visions of her own. The Ghost is a creepy horror film, with a twisted ending.The story is creepy. As with most Asians horror films of its time, this does involve a black-haired, pale-skinned female ghost; this didn't bother me at all since I'm a fan of this style, and I only watch these films occasionally. It moves at a very consistent pace, using the essential horror elements and occasionally having a mystery-vibe. There's plenty of ghostly imagery, and plenty of great jump-scares. The ending of the film was unexpected; the twist was actually a twist thanks to the film's subtle hints. The acting was great from the entire cast, the music was also good.Overall, The Ghost is a great ghost story, with great scares and a twisted finale. It isn't the most original concept/design, though; so, if you're burned out on these films, I suggest waiting a few weeks or months to watch this.

And yet an extensive search of my movie journal and the places I post reviews on the Internet failed to turn it up, so I went with the next most probable explanation: the opening scene is so derivative of other, usually better, movies that I thought I'd seen it before because I had--in another movie. This sense of filmic &lt;em>deja vu&lt;/em> stayed with me throughout; it hit me strongest during the climax, at which point I was &lt;em>almost&lt;/em>, but not quite, sure I had, in fact, seen it before. The result: I was annoyed I'd wasted another ninety minutes of my life on this movie when I could have watched one or more of the other films it obviously lifted from (&lt;em>Say My Name 3x&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Bunshinsaba&lt;/em>, the original Ghost School trilogy, &lt;em>Cut&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Ring&lt;/em>, probably half a dozen others).Plot: Ji-won (&lt;em>My Girlfriend Is an Agent&lt;/em>'s Ha-neul Kim) is a high school student with amnesia. Very few people around her truly believe she has amnesia, which becomes an important point later, but I'm getting ahead of myself. In any case, she discovers she is connected to a group of friends who are being killed off one by one. She has to discover what the connection is before she winds up being a victim. (The obvious question here is answered by the ""Very few people..."" sentence, but really, couldn't she ask someone who actually believed?)It is an utterly generic supernatural slasher from Asia, complete with long-black-haired-ghost, high school stereotypes, and not-too-compelling deaths. Which means that while it shouldn't be your first choice if you're even a casual fan of the genre, it's at least watchable enough to kill some time with; at least Kim doesn't get anything wrong. Just don't find yourself killing time with it twice. **",2,"Gives new definition to the term ""derivative"".",1341532800,"07 6, 2012",2012,2083,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Ryeong', 'lt', '>', 'Tae-kyeong', 'Kim', '2004', 'was', 'watching', 'opening', 'scene', 'lt', '>', 'Ryeong', 'lt', '>', 'been', 'released', 'English-speaking', 'countries', 'titles', 'lt', '>', 'Ghost', 'lt', '>', 'lt', '>', 'Dead', 'Friend', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'swore', ""'d"", 'seen', 'movie', 'yet', 'extensive', 'search', 'movie', 'journal', 'places', 'post', 'reviews', 'Internet', 'failed', 'turn', 'up', 'went', 'next', 'most', 'probable', 'explanation', 'opening', 'scene', 'so', 'derivative', 'other', 'usually', 'better', 'movies', 'thought', ""'d"", 'seen', 'had', 'movie', 'sense', 'filmic', 'lt', '>', 'deja', 'vu', 'lt', '>', 'stayed', 'hit', 'strongest', 'climax', 'point', 'was', 'lt', '>', 'almost', 'lt', '>', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'had', 'fact', 'seen', 'result', 'was', 'annoyed', ""'d"", 'wasted', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'life', 'movie', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'watched', 'one', 'more', 'other', 'films', 'obviously', 'lifted', 'lt', '>', 'Say', 'My', 'Name', '3x', 'lt', '>', 'lt', '>', 'Bunshinsaba', 'lt', '>', 'original', 'Ghost', 'School', 'trilogy', 'lt', '>', 'Cut', 'lt', '>', 'lt', '>', 'Ring', 'lt', '>', 'probably', 'dozen', 'others', '.Plot', 'Ji-won', 'lt', '>', 'My', 'Girlfriend', 'Agent', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Ha-neul', 'Kim', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'amnesia', 'Very', 'few', 'people', 'truly', 'believe', 'amnesia', 'important', 'point', 'later', ""'m"", 'getting', 'ahead', 'case', 'connected', 'group', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'being', 'killed', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'discover', 'what', 'connection', 'up', 'being', 'victim', 'obvious', 'question', 'here', 'answered', 'Very', 'few', 'people', 'sentence', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'ask', 'someone', 'who', 'actually', 'believed', 'utterly', 'generic', 'supernatural', 'slasher', 'Asia', 'complete', 'long-black-haired-ghost', 'high', 'school', 'stereotypes', 'not-too-compelling', 'deaths', 'Which', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'first', 'choice', ""'re"", 'even', 'casual', 'fan', 'genre', 'least', 'watchable', 'enough', 'kill', 'time', 'least', 'Kim', ""n't"", 'get', 'anything', 'wrong', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'killing', 'time', 'twice', '**']",The Ghost
1047023,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B000MM0LHS,Tim Janson,"[17, 19]","The Ghost or ""Ryeong"" is a new Korean horror film, part of the Tartan Asia Extreme line.  The film is shackled with the tag line ""The Grudge meets Dark Water"" and that does a real disservice to the film for a number or reasons.  The Ghost doesn't have nearly the scare factor of The Grudge but it has vastly superior characterization and a more complex plot.  While the Grudge was a straight horror film, The Ghost is more of a mystery with horror elements.Min Ji-Won is a student suffering from amnesia.  She experienced a traumatic event a year ago and has lost all memories of her past.  Something terrible happened but everyone around her avoids revealing the details.  Min plans to leave her home and go to school far away to try and get her life back together.  This results in an angry conflict with her mother who doesn't want to be left alone and assails Min with a guilt trip.  Meanwhile her sometimes boyfriend, Park, does his best to get Min to carry on with life, but he's also unwilling to tell her about her past.Min has become something of a pariah at school, avoided by her former friends.  When those friends end up dying, one by one, apparently of drowning, Min begins experiencing visions and flashbacks.  She visits one of her friends who has been hospitalized in a psych ward and she learns about Su-in, who was bullied and humiliated because her family was poor.  A shaken Min realizes that she was the ring-leader of her school clique that tormented Su-in, often pretending to be her friend just so they could embarrass her later.  A desperate Min tries to unravel the events that led to the tragedy and her loss of memory but Min may not like what she finally uncovers.The Ghost also gets compared quite a bit to The Ring and yes, we do have that ubiquitous long, dark haired female ghost out for revenge but that's where the comparison ends.  There's a distinctly different feel to The Ghost than The Ring and other Asian films.  The Ghost really go doesn't go for the quick scares that make you jump out of your seat, preferring a more cerebral approach.  You quickly find yourself caught up in wanting to know what happened to Min a year a go that caused her to loser her memories.  The ghost became secondary to Min's situation.Ha-Neul Kim as Min draws upon our sympathies for her dilemma and then promptly turns things upside down when we find out that Min wasn't such a nice girl to begin with.  Just when you think things have been resolved, an unexpected twist near the end will change your whole view of the film.I thoroughly enjoyed all of the performances in The Ghost, especially Ha-Neul Kim's and Ran Choi's, who played Min's rather twisted mother.  The soundtrack reminded me of old school horror films that had that pulse-pounding quality to it.  I suppose The Ghost could be criticized for being a bit slow in spots and it's a valid point.  On the other hand I appreciated Director Tae-kyeong Kim's clever plot and character development.  Certainly this is a different film than other Asian horror films but give it a chance, I think you will be surprised.",4,SLOWER BUT MORE CEREBRAL THAN THE GRUDGE,1181865600,"06 15, 2007",2007,3097,"['Ghost', 'Ryeong', 'new', 'Korean', 'horror', 'film', 'part', 'Tartan', 'Asia', 'Extreme', 'line', 'film', 'shackled', 'tag', 'line', 'Grudge', 'meets', 'Dark', 'Water', 'real', 'disservice', 'film', 'number', 'reasons', 'Ghost', ""n't"", 'have', 'nearly', 'scare', 'factor', 'Grudge', 'vastly', 'superior', 'characterization', 'more', 'complex', 'plot', 'Grudge', 'was', 'straight', 'horror', 'film', 'Ghost', 'more', 'mystery', 'horror', 'elements.Min', 'Ji-Won', 'student', 'suffering', 'amnesia', 'experienced', 'traumatic', 'event', 'year', 'ago', 'lost', 'memories', 'past', 'Something', 'terrible', 'happened', 'everyone', 'avoids', 'revealing', 'details', 'Min', 'leave', 'home', 'go', 'school', 'far', 'away', 'try', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'together', 'results', 'angry', 'conflict', 'mother', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'Min', 'guilt', 'trip', 'Meanwhile', 'sometimes', 'boyfriend', 'Park', 'best', 'get', 'Min', 'carry', 'life', 'also', 'unwilling', 'tell', 'past.Min', 'become', 'something', 'pariah', 'school', 'avoided', 'former', 'friends', 'When', 'friends', 'end', 'up', 'dying', 'one', 'one', 'apparently', 'drowning', 'Min', 'experiencing', 'visions', 'flashbacks', 'one', 'friends', 'who', 'been', 'hospitalized', 'psych', 'ward', 'Su-in', 'who', 'was', 'bullied', 'humiliated', 'family', 'was', 'poor', 'shaken', 'Min', 'was', 'ring-leader', 'school', 'clique', 'tormented', 'Su-in', 'often', 'pretending', 'be', 'friend', 'just', 'so', 'could', 'embarrass', 'later', 'desperate', 'Min', 'tries', 'unravel', 'events', 'led', 'tragedy', 'loss', 'memory', 'Min', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'what', 'finally', 'uncovers.The', 'Ghost', 'also', 'compared', 'quite', 'bit', 'Ring', 'yes', 'do', 'have', 'ubiquitous', 'long', 'dark', 'haired', 'female', 'ghost', 'revenge', 'where', 'comparison', 'distinctly', 'different', 'feel', 'Ghost', 'Ring', 'other', 'Asian', 'films', 'Ghost', 'really', 'go', ""n't"", 'go', 'quick', 'scares', 'make', 'jump', 'seat', 'preferring', 'more', 'cerebral', 'approach', 'quickly', 'find', 'caught', 'up', 'wanting', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'Min', 'year', 'go', 'caused', 'loser', 'memories', 'ghost', 'became', 'secondary', 'Min', 'situation.Ha-Neul', 'Kim', 'Min', 'sympathies', 'dilemma', 'then', 'promptly', 'things', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'Min', 'was', ""n't"", 'such', 'nice', 'girl', 'begin', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'resolved', 'unexpected', 'twist', 'end', 'will', 'change', 'whole', 'view', 'film.I', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'performances', 'Ghost', 'especially', 'Ha-Neul', 'Kim', 'Ran', 'Choi', 'who', 'played', 'Min', 'rather', 'twisted', 'mother', 'soundtrack', 'reminded', 'old', 'school', 'horror', 'films', 'had', 'pulse-pounding', 'quality', 'suppose', 'Ghost', 'could', 'be', 'criticized', 'being', 'bit', 'slow', 'spots', 'valid', 'point', 'other', 'hand', 'appreciated', 'Director', 'Tae-kyeong', 'Kim', 'clever', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'Certainly', 'different', 'film', 'other', 'Asian', 'horror', 'films', 'give', 'chance', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'surprised']",The Ghost
