Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","The biggest surprise is that Dean Cain manages to shed his bland flavor enough to assume a bit of that New York huckster's attitude, although since this is Dean Cain, his con man role doesn't even come close to being slightly menacing. MAKING MR. RIGHT is a television Lifetime movie and, because the PYGMALION well seems pretty inexhaustible, it readily lifts from that premise.Hallie Galloway (curvy Christina Cox) is in full control of her universe. An uptight, ambitious features editor of the Manhattan Line magazine, she's inches away from that Senior Editor promotion. In a departmental brainstorming session, Hallie presents a magazine feature which would showcase the three most eligible confirmed bachelors, culminating in an auction in which the ladies could bid on their preferred bachelor. If Hallie pulls this off, she lands that Senior Editor gig. And since Hallie is in full control of her universe, no way does her project get derailed.Her project gets derailed when she bumps into a slovenly street hustler named Eddie (Dean Cain, sporting unconvincing facial hair) and she ends up making a bet with a rival co-worker that she could transform Eddie into not only a sophisticated gent but also into her magazine's Bachelor of the Year. Exit Eddie who ""smells like dirty spaghetti"" and in dire need of lessons in manners and elocution. And in the fullness of several commercial breaks, enter the elegant, articulate Edmund Penbroke III. He doesn't slurp or anything.While nowhere near the dizzying stratosphere of PYGMALION or MY FAIR LADY, MAKING MR. RIGHT has its moments. This is mostly thanks to the two leads who manage a fine chemistry between them. There won't be any wagers taken on how the story'll end up. The plot hits all the familiar beats. It's Dean Cain, so we know he'll polish up just fine, just as we know that the uptight Hallie Galloway - or, as Eddie tends to call her, ""Hallie Gal"" -  will loosen up, thanks to Eddie's influence. But, as they say, it's all about the journey. There's fun in watching Eddie and Hallie circling each other. And I was surprised at how gratified I was when, at the end, the closing captions revealed what lay in store for these two. No spoiler when I say that by the time it's all done, Hallie Galloway no longer controls her universe, and her preferring it that way.",3,Hallie Gal and Manhattan's most eligible burglar,1310947200,"07 18, 2011",2011,2334,"['biggest', 'surprise', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'shed', 'bland', 'flavor', 'enough', 'assume', 'bit', 'New', 'York', 'huckster', 'attitude', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'con', 'man', 'role', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'being', 'slightly', 'menacing', 'MAKING', 'MR', 'RIGHT', 'television', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'PYGMALION', 'well', 'pretty', 'inexhaustible', 'readily', 'Galloway', 'curvy', 'Christina', 'Cox', 'full', 'control', 'universe', 'uptight', 'ambitious', 'features', 'editor', 'Manhattan', 'Line', 'magazine', 'inches', 'away', 'Senior', 'Editor', 'promotion', 'departmental', 'brainstorming', 'session', 'Hallie', 'magazine', 'feature', 'would', 'showcase', 'three', 'most', 'eligible', 'confirmed', 'bachelors', 'culminating', 'auction', 'ladies', 'could', 'bid', 'preferred', 'bachelor', 'Hallie', 'off', 'Senior', 'Editor', 'gig', 'Hallie', 'full', 'control', 'universe', 'way', 'project', 'get', 'derailed.Her', 'project', 'derailed', 'when', 'bumps', 'slovenly', 'street', 'hustler', 'named', 'Eddie', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'sporting', 'unconvincing', 'facial', 'hair', 'up', 'making', 'bet', 'rival', 'co-worker', 'could', 'transform', 'Eddie', 'not', 'only', 'sophisticated', 'gent', 'also', 'magazine', 'Bachelor', 'Year', 'Exit', 'Eddie', 'who', 'smells', 'dirty', 'spaghetti', 'dire', 'need', 'lessons', 'manners', 'elocution', 'fullness', 'several', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'enter', 'elegant', 'articulate', 'Edmund', 'Penbroke', 'III', ""n't"", 'slurp', 'anything.While', 'nowhere', 'dizzying', 'stratosphere', 'PYGMALION', 'MY', 'FAIR', 'LADY', 'MAKING', 'MR', 'RIGHT', 'moments', 'mostly', 'thanks', 'two', 'leads', 'who', 'manage', 'fine', 'chemistry', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'wagers', 'taken', 'how', 'story', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'plot', 'familiar', 'beats', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'know', ""'ll"", 'polish', 'up', 'just', 'fine', 'just', 'know', 'uptight', 'Hallie', 'Galloway', 'Eddie', 'call', 'Hallie', 'Gal', 'will', 'loosen', 'up', 'thanks', 'Eddie', 'influence', 'say', 'journey', 'fun', 'watching', 'Eddie', 'Hallie', 'circling', 'other', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'gratified', 'was', 'when', 'end', 'closing', 'captions', 'revealed', 'what', 'lay', 'store', 'two', 'spoiler', 'when', 'say', 'time', 'done', 'Hallie', 'Galloway', 'no', 'longer', 'universe', 'preferring', 'way']",N/A

1334505,A1CA1A1MGW0I3J,B0039ZBM3W,Raisuli the Magnificent,"[9, 14]","Wow, my original review got taken down.  Did I hit a nerve?  You know, if someone was to poke holes at the crap I've shot and worked on, I'd like to think that I could take it.  And you know what?  I have.  I've had scripts I've written and footage I've shot torn to shreds by pros.  So, when I post an honest review on a corporate piece of crap, one specifically tailored for the evening soap female audience, AND it gets removed, I take notice.This piece of Lifetime market driven made for TV film is aimed at the professional mother (who may or may not be married) and/or the single professional woman, and females aspiring to be such.  Not a problem.  That's what Lifetime does.  It's what they cater to.  It's what they do.  But something cranked out with as much energy as a snowflake hitting the ground, but fobbed off as a romantic comedy is a bit of a stretch.Dean Cain is miscast.  The man is too effete for the role.  The film needed a gritty semi-good looking type.  But, because the market data says that women like attractive actors, we have flat line talent thesping lines as if they're reading a year end sale report for some hardline corporation.  The male lead needed to be street savvy, rugged, a bit crude (but not too much), and also have a sense of slickness and suave all at once.  Dean Cain is none of these things.Christina Cox knows her role, or better yet knows that this is going to be a one time air knock off, so she says her lines professionally, but without invoking much passion--just like the rest of the cast.  It's like the cast has their next gig on their minds, and not their current job.Comedy?  Give me a break.  Romance?  Yeah, a train crash is more subtle.  A little romantic suspense?  No.  Drama?  What there is is lightweight.Look, the truth of it is I was expecting a different film.  But, when I got this, and took a chance on it knowing it was the wrong movie, I couldn't help but think to myself 'my god, who consented to be in this thing?'It's not the worst film ever done.  It's got a very nice professional finish to it, but beyond that it's pretty vapid entertainment.",1,"Flat, dull and unfunny.",1301097600,"03 26, 2011",2011,2121,"['Wow', 'original', 'review', 'got', 'taken', 'down', 'Did', 'hit', 'nerve', 'know', 'someone', 'was', 'poke', 'holes', 'crap', ""'ve"", 'shot', 'worked', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', 'could', 'take', 'know', 'what', 'have', ""'ve"", 'had', 'scripts', ""'ve"", 'written', 'footage', ""'ve"", 'shot', 'torn', 'shreds', 'pros', 'So', 'when', 'post', 'honest', 'review', 'corporate', 'piece', 'crap', 'one', 'specifically', 'tailored', 'evening', 'soap', 'female', 'audience', 'removed', 'take', 'notice.This', 'piece', 'Lifetime', 'market', 'driven', 'made', 'TV', 'film', 'aimed', 'professional', 'mother', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'married', 'and/or', 'single', 'professional', 'woman', 'females', 'aspiring', 'be', 'such', 'Not', 'problem', 'what', 'Lifetime', 'what', 'cater', 'what', 'do', 'something', 'cranked', 'out', 'as', 'much', 'energy', 'snowflake', 'hitting', 'ground', 'fobbed', 'off', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'bit', 'stretch.Dean', 'Cain', 'miscast', 'man', 'too', 'effete', 'role', 'film', 'needed', 'gritty', 'semi-good', 'looking', 'type', 'market', 'data', 'women', 'attractive', 'actors', 'have', 'flat', 'line', 'talent', 'thesping', 'lines', ""'re"", 'reading', 'year', 'end', 'sale', 'report', 'hardline', 'corporation', 'male', 'lead', 'needed', 'be', 'street', 'savvy', 'rugged', 'bit', 'crude', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'also', 'have', 'sense', 'slickness', 'suave', 'once', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'none', 'things.Christina', 'Cox', 'role', 'better', 'yet', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'time', 'air', 'knock', 'off', 'lines', 'professionally', 'invoking', 'much', 'passion', 'just', 'rest', 'cast', 'cast', 'next', 'gig', 'minds', 'not', 'current', 'job.Comedy', 'Give', 'break', 'Romance', 'Yeah', 'train', 'crash', 'more', 'subtle', 'little', 'romantic', 'suspense', 'No', 'Drama', 'What', 'lightweight.Look', 'truth', 'was', 'expecting', 'different', 'film', 'when', 'got', 'took', 'chance', 'knowing', 'was', 'wrong', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'myself', ""'my"", 'god', 'who', 'consented', 'be', 'thing', 'not', 'worst', 'film', 'ever', 'done', 'got', 'very', 'nice', 'professional', 'finish', 'pretty', 'vapid', 'entertainment']",N/A
