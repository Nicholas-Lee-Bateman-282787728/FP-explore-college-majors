1039610,A1H0CWFQY2HFGG,B000LP5CXY,"Bud Bundy ""B movie lover""","[4, 4]","An asteroid knocks the earth out of its orbit, causing it to get closer to the sun, and making it extremely hot.  Our group of characters is trying to get to the airport so they can catch a plane to the north pole or someplace.  Now, you may ask yourself, what is the most tiresomely clich&eacute;d group of characters that could be put into a movie?  Well, let's have a guy, his girlfriend, and his ex-wife.  Yup, that should do it.  The relationships between these characters are so shallow it's comical - the girlfriend is concerned because the guy is spending a lot of time with his ex-wife.  She tries to talk to him about it, he just smiles and assures her that ""Everything will work out great in the end"".  Good grief.Okay, it's so hot that cars are spontaneously exploding.  Sure.  If it gets really hot, all the antifreeze will eventually boil out of the radiator, and if you try to keep driving, the engine will seize up and it will stop.  It will not explode.  Even if it did explode, it would be the gas tank that goes up, but they've planted pyrotechnic charges throughout the car - mostly in the passenger compartment - so the cars just go off like a bomb.  Best of all - the people are wearing long-sleeved shirts and JACKETS!  Yes, it's so hot that cars are exploding, but everyone is dressed as if it's about 60 degrees.  Good catch there, Mr. Director.  At one point they go into the sewers to cool off, and suddenly everyone has donned an extra layer of clothing.  Even though they had nothing with them a moment before.And then there's the ending:SPOILEREven though the earth is in a different orbit, everything just magically turns out okay.  It gets cooler.  Yeah, it just...happens.  No explanation.  Maybe the earth wore a groove in space from its previous orbit, and after a while, it just plopped back into its groove?  Seriously, that seems to be about the best explanation one could come up with.Anyhow, this is just an abysmal waste of time.",1,Dismal failure,1238889600,"04 5, 2009",2009,1970,"['asteroid', 'earth', 'orbit', 'causing', 'get', 'closer', 'sun', 'making', 'extremely', 'hot', 'group', 'characters', 'trying', 'get', 'airport', 'can', 'catch', 'plane', 'north', 'pole', 'someplace', 'Now', 'may', 'ask', 'what', 'most', 'tiresomely', 'clich', 'eacute', 'group', 'characters', 'could', 'be', 'put', 'movie', 'Well', 'let', 'have', 'guy', 'girlfriend', 'ex-wife', 'Yup', 'should', 'do', 'relationships', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'shallow', 'comical', 'girlfriend', 'concerned', 'guy', 'spending', 'lot', 'time', 'ex-wife', 'talk', 'just', 'smiles', 'Everything', 'will', 'work', 'out', 'great', 'end', 'Good', 'grief.Okay', 'so', 'hot', 'cars', 'are', 'spontaneously', 'exploding', 'Sure', 'really', 'hot', 'antifreeze', 'will', 'eventually', 'boil', 'radiator', 'try', 'keep', 'driving', 'engine', 'will', 'seize', 'up', 'will', 'stop', 'will', 'not', 'explode', 'Even', 'did', 'explode', 'would', 'be', 'gas', 'tank', 'up', ""'ve"", 'planted', 'pyrotechnic', 'charges', 'car', 'mostly', 'passenger', 'compartment', 'cars', 'just', 'go', 'off', 'bomb', 'Best', 'people', 'are', 'wearing', 'long-sleeved', 'shirts', 'JACKETS', 'Yes', 'so', 'hot', 'cars', 'are', 'exploding', 'everyone', 'dressed', '60', 'degrees', 'Good', 'catch', 'there', 'Mr.', 'Director', 'one', 'point', 'go', 'sewers', 'cool', 'off', 'suddenly', 'everyone', 'donned', 'extra', 'layer', 'clothing', 'Even', 'had', 'nothing', 'moment', 'before.And', 'then', 'ending', 'SPOILEREven', 'earth', 'different', 'orbit', 'everything', 'just', 'magically', 'out', 'okay', 'cooler', 'Yeah', 'just', 'explanation', 'Maybe', 'earth', 'wore', 'groove', 'space', 'previous', 'orbit', 'while', 'just', 'plopped', 'back', 'groove', 'Seriously', 'be', 'best', 'explanation', 'one', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'with.Anyhow', 'just', 'abysmal', 'waste', 'time']",Meltdown: Days of Destruction

It lacked almost everything.So movie is about this asteroid deal that breaks up and the bigger half is headed for the Earth. It missed the Earth but it somehow shifts the Earth's orbit closer to the sun. People start dehydrating, dying, etc. For some odd reason, only a couple of people can survive and try to make it North.Bad plot. It should have had more buildup at the beginning. The Earth gets hit or not should have lasted a little longer. It all happened very quickly. It was unreasonable that at 139 degrees, the people were wearing long sleeves and with minimal sweat.Bad acting. It was like they picked people off the street and gave them a chance. They have no personalities whatsoever, makes you lose interest very fast.Overall, i dont recommend the movie. Bad plot and bad acting. Good to see once, but only if you are very bored.",1,Bad Acting...,1173139200,"03 6, 2007",2007,893,"['movie', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'elements', 'made', 'bad', 'lacked', 'almost', 'everything.So', 'movie', 'asteroid', 'deal', 'up', 'bigger', 'half', 'headed', 'Earth', 'missed', 'Earth', 'somehow', 'Earth', 'orbit', 'closer', 'sun', 'People', 'start', 'dehydrating', 'dying', 'etc', 'odd', 'reason', 'only', 'couple', 'people', 'can', 'survive', 'try', 'make', 'North.Bad', 'plot', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'buildup', 'beginning', 'Earth', 'hit', 'not', 'should', 'have', 'lasted', 'little', 'longer', 'happened', 'very', 'quickly', 'was', 'unreasonable', '139', 'degrees', 'people', 'were', 'wearing', 'long', 'sleeves', 'minimal', 'sweat.Bad', 'acting', 'was', 'picked', 'people', 'street', 'gave', 'chance', 'have', 'personalities', 'whatsoever', 'lose', 'interest', 'very', 'fast.Overall', 'i', 'dont', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Bad', 'plot', 'bad', 'acting', 'Good', 'see', 'once', 'only', 'are', 'very', 'bored']",Meltdown: Days of Destruction
