818872,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B0001ZX006,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[0, 1]","Ok, the basic plot layout is this: six unlikely friends band together to break into the Educational Testing Service (ETS) building in Princeton, NJ in order to steal the answers to the upcoming SAT's.  The plan begins with Kyle (Chris Evans) and his best friend Matty (Bryan Greenburg).  Kyle is an aspiring architect who dreams of going to Cornell University in Ithica.  He needs at least a 1430, but he got a 1020 on his first crack at the tests.  He's afraid that he's too ""average"" for the SAT.  Matty wants to go to the University of Maryland for one reason, his girlfriend Sandy goes there, and unfortunately for Matty, he's not too bright.  The duo soon realizes that a fellow classmate's father owns the ETS building, so they ask Francesca (Scarlett Johansson) to help them out.  Francesca is a rich punk girl who would love nothing more than to stick it to her father who pays more attention to his 20-year-old girlfriends than her (keep in mind that the character, and Johannson I think, are 18).  Kyle also tells Anna (Erika Christensen) about the plan because he has a ""feeling"" about her.  Francesca wonders aloud if the feeling took place near his crotch.  Anyway, Anna is number 2 in the class.  She is an overachiever who is trying hard to fulfill her parents' expectations, which include getting into Brown, although, Anna secretly has other desires.  The first time Anna took the test, she froze after reading a story problem about a woman on a subway in New York, which I found to be one of the dumbest plot points in the film.  Anyway, one day, the local basketball star, Desmond (Darius Miles, who is one of the WORST actors I have ever seen) comes to Anna for help.  He is a great ball-player, but his academics aren't quite up to par, and he needs a 900 to get into St. John's College.  Finally, a stoner (who is also a genius) named Roy (Leonard Nam) overhears Kyle and Matty talking about the plan, so he is included as well.Each student had a reason for stealing the SAT's, and yet, each of them found a reason not to as well.  Sadly, the movie was slightly anti-climactic, but the lack of climax for the six main characters allowed for one of more funny jokes in the movie, which involved the other stoners at the school being able to get into Harvard.  SAT, according to Roy, would then stand for ""Stoned And Toasted"".I must say, for a group of high school stereotypes, I knew a lot of them at my school.  Also, while on the surface the characters were nothing more than stereotypes, deep down, they did have other layers.  For example, Desmond did have some good math skills, Roy was a master programmer, and Francesca was pretty wise for a punk girl.  The best character by far is Roy.  He is the funniest, the smartest, and in a way, one of the wisest.  Maybe the movie carries an anti-pot message, I'm not sure.  Roy, despite being stoned most of the time, is actually able to get the gang out of a few tight spots, although, it does hinder them at times as well.This movie did have a good share of flaws, though.  I already talked about the subway question.  Man that was a stupid, contrived, unnecessary idea.  Furthermore, I would be happy if there NEVER AGAIN was a ""Matrix"" ripoff!  I'm so sick of those.  Also, I guess they only cast Darius Miles because he could look the part of a great basketball player, because they sure didn't cast him for his acting ability!  He was monotonous and he looked very uncomfortable in the movie.Anyway, this movie will entertain you.  It has its flaws, but when it's funny, it's really funny.  This should be a good rental.Hey, did you notic in my title that the words begin with SAT?

I remember that because it was during the same time period where I had lots of school work to take care of.  I was studying for my mid year exams and not that long ealier, I had taken the PSAT's.  A movie this kind of plot, a bunch kids stealing test scores, definetly got my attention.  At the time, there was also another comedy in theaters-Eurotrip.  From the commercials, I thought the Perfect was going to laugh out loud funny and Eurotrip was just going to be some dumb retarded comedy.  However I did miss both films when they were in theaters but I did catch'em when they were later on tv.  Here is what's ironic-I found Eurotrip to be hilarious (and one of my favorite films today) and The Perfect score to be a complete waste of time.  Obviousely this movie was really dissapointing.Kyle is a role model student with good grades and hopes of being an architect.  However, he finds himself having difficulty on SAT.  His friend Matty is an underachiever who would like to do well on the SAT so he can go to the same college as his girlfriend.  They both conclude that the SAT is kinda pointless (b/c it doesn't test you on how smart you are) and unfair (b/c its standing in their way)  They enlist the help of Francessca whose father owns the building of where the SATs scores are located.  Kyle also slips the plan to his crush Anna, a very intelligent student whose has some the best academic achievements in school but finds trouble with the SAT.  Anna brings in Desmond, a start basketball player who needs a 900 or better to get into college.  The last person to join the team is Roy a slacker and stoner.  With their combined brain power, the can devise a perfect plan in order to achieve the perfect and thus create a happy and bright future.A movie with a plot like this sounds funny.  However, it ultimatley failed to deliver laughs.  The only scene I laughed at was when Kyle's brother said what his score (it was something really LOW like 125).  The movie does try to be funny but in the end, it really just tries to force the audience to laugh.

On a bell curve, it would be graded slightly above average.To be perfectly honest, my wife and I liked The Perfect Score better than the other, far more highly rated, Scarlett Johansson movie Ghost World. Now, *that* movie was a steaming pile. Yet, it's considered quite good by critics and viewers alike. Go figure.The Perfect Score is a more entertaining movie than Ghost World. The ensemble cast offers enough humor to keep the plot moving and the movie interesting. No, it's not the The Breakfast Club. But, frankly, The Breakfast Club isn't The Breakfast Club the way most of us remember it, anyway. That movie doesn't really hold up some 20 years on and, in fact, looks about as goofy as The Perfect Score in plot and execution. Actually, there were a few moments of genuine hilarity and near brilliance in The Perfect Score.Scarlett sizzles as usual. She's a hottie with a lot of talent -- quite a rarity in Hollywood these days, where hotties rule whether they're talented or not.But the other actors turned in nice performances, too.I disagree with the Amazon editorial reviewer who wrote, ""Still, only [Leonardo] Nam and Johansson (who, after Ghost World, Lost in Translation, and Girl with a Pearl Earring, is becoming a true movie star) stand out of the bland pack.""We thought the acting was pretty good from all performers, even NBA player Darius Miles who was wooden and somewhat disengaged, but no more so than Keanu Reeves -- and look where Reeves is these days: an A-list powerhouse.The plot is thin. The entire movie is fluff. But it's well-made, entertaining fluff. In Scarlett's canon of movies, I'd rank this one ahead of a few others.

Certainly it makes ETS look like a company with a bunch of nitwits running it, and in addition shows that they have lousy security and any bunch of six random idiot teens could break in and get all of the answers to any particular SAT exam.  Was product placement so important to ETS that they let the filmmakers run down their whole organization in this way?

818889,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0001ZX006,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[9, 9]","No, I do not remember my SAT score, but I have taught enough high school students terrorized by the thought of how a four digit number could totally ruin their lives (i.e., deny them the college of their dreams) to realize that this is a tender subject.  Which is why it is nice to report that &quot;The Perfect Score&quot; does take things seriously at the same time it is having fun with the paranoia.  I might not be able to answer any of the SAT questions that pop up during the movie, but I do know that the screenplay by Mark Schwahn (creator of &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;), Marc Hyman  (&quot;Osmosis Jones&quot;) and Jon Zack (&quot;Out Cold&quot;) is a lot better than I would have thought for a movie like this 2004 comedy.The story takes place in Princeton, New Jersey which is, oddly enough, where you find the Princeton Testing Center that is the home of the SAT exam (SAT stood for Scholastic Aptitude Test but one of the running gags in this film is the effort to come up with a more appropriate meaning to the anagram).  The first SAT exam of the year has come and gone and Kyle (Chris Evans) discovers his score is too low to get him into Cornell and Anna (Erika Christensen) can apparently forget about her parents' dream of Brown.  The next exam is in two weeks and since getting smarter in a fortnight is not likely, stealing the exam sounds like a good idea.  Kyle's friend Matty (Bryan Greenberg), already bound for Maryland, is willing to help and they approach Francesca (Scarlett Johansson), whose daddy happens to run PTC and can provide a way in.  The final members of the group are Desmond (Darius Miles), a basketball star whose mom wants him to go to college, and Roy (Leonardo Nam), a stoner who is involved only because he knows about what is going on.Now, in the real world stealing one SAT exam does not do you any good because there are several versions, so the person sitting next to you can have different questions or the questions are in a different order (or both).  But that is besides the point in &quot;The Perfect Score&quot; and I ended up liking this movie a lot more than I thought I would for three reasons.  The first I cannot tell you about because it would spoil the movie, but it has to do with an interesting twist on expectations.  The second is the character of Desmond's mother (Tyra Ferrell), who has an impact on more than just her son.  This film plays a lot with the stereotypes, from class brain to dumb jock to stoner, and I like the way Desmond's mother fits into that mold as well.  The third is that this film comes up with a really, really great line about why not to be scared about the questions on the SAT, spoken, of course, by the most ironic character in the mix.&quot;The Perfect Score&quot; is an enjoyable little caper comedy that certainly exceeds expectations, which is not a bad recommendation given most teen comedies today.  The characters manage to avoid being stupid, a standard pitfall in the genre, although I suspect there are those who will be disappointed with the way things get resolved at the end.  I also think it was nice that if Scarlett Johansson could not get an Oscar nomination for either &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; or &quot;Girl With a PEarl Earring&quot; then at least she got to do a decent &quot;Matrix&quot; takeoff in this film.  Plus it was interesting to see Darius Miles who went to the pros instead of attending St. Johns University play a character who does the opposite, although it is ironic to see Mike Jarvis play himself since he had been fired from the St. Johns post by the time &quot;The Perfect Score&quot; was released.",4,Could stealing the SAT be easier than taking the SAT?,1088467200,"06 29, 2004",2004,3641,"['do', 'not', 'remember', 'SAT', 'score', 'have', 'taught', 'enough', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'terrorized', 'thought', 'how', 'four', 'digit', 'number', 'could', 'totally', 'ruin', 'lives', 'i.e.', 'deny', 'college', 'dreams', 'realize', 'tender', 'subject', 'Which', 'why', 'nice', 'report', 'quot', 'Perfect', 'Score', 'quot', 'take', 'things', 'seriously', 'same', 'time', 'having', 'fun', 'paranoia', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'answer', 'SAT', 'questions', 'pop', 'up', 'movie', 'do', 'know', 'screenplay', 'Mark', 'Schwahn', 'creator', 'quot', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'quot', 'Marc', 'Hyman', 'quot', 'Osmosis', 'Jones', 'quot', 'Jon', 'Zack', 'quot', 'Out', 'Cold', 'quot', 'lot', 'better', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'movie', '2004', 'comedy.The', 'story', 'place', 'Princeton', 'New', 'Jersey', 'oddly', 'enough', 'where', 'find', 'Princeton', 'Testing', 'Center', 'home', 'SAT', 'exam', 'SAT', 'stood', 'Scholastic', 'Aptitude', 'Test', 'one', 'running', 'gags', 'film', 'effort', 'come', 'up', 'more', 'appropriate', 'meaning', 'anagram', 'first', 'SAT', 'exam', 'year', 'come', 'gone', 'Kyle', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'score', 'too', 'low', 'get', 'Cornell', 'Anna', 'Erika', 'Christensen', 'can', 'apparently', 'forget', 'parents', 'dream', 'Brown', 'next', 'exam', 'two', 'weeks', 'getting', 'smarter', 'fortnight', 'not', 'likely', 'stealing', 'exam', 'sounds', 'good', 'idea', 'Kyle', 'friend', 'Matty', 'Bryan', 'Greenberg', 'already', 'bound', 'Maryland', 'willing', 'help', 'approach', 'Francesca', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'daddy', 'run', 'PTC', 'can', 'provide', 'way', 'final', 'members', 'group', 'are', 'Desmond', 'Darius', 'Miles', 'basketball', 'star', 'mom', 'go', 'college', 'Roy', 'Leonardo', 'Nam', 'stoner', 'who', 'involved', 'only', 'what', 'going', 'on.Now', 'real', 'world', 'stealing', 'one', 'SAT', 'exam', 'not', 'do', 'good', 'are', 'several', 'versions', 'person', 'sitting', 'next', 'can', 'have', 'different', 'questions', 'questions', 'are', 'different', 'order', 'point', 'quot', 'Perfect', 'Score', 'quot', 'ended', 'up', 'liking', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'thought', 'would', 'three', 'reasons', 'first', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'would', 'spoil', 'movie', 'do', 'interesting', 'twist', 'expectations', 'second', 'character', 'Desmond', 'mother', 'Tyra', 'Ferrell', 'who', 'impact', 'more', 'just', 'son', 'film', 'lot', 'stereotypes', 'class', 'brain', 'dumb', 'jock', 'stoner', 'like', 'way', 'Desmond', 'mother', 'mold', 'as', 'well', 'third', 'film', 'up', 'really', 'really', 'great', 'line', 'why', 'not', 'be', 'scared', 'questions', 'SAT', 'spoken', 'course', 'most', 'ironic', 'character', 'mix.', 'quot', 'Perfect', 'Score', 'quot', 'enjoyable', 'little', 'caper', 'comedy', 'certainly', 'expectations', 'not', 'bad', 'recommendation', 'given', 'most', 'teen', 'comedies', 'today', 'characters', 'manage', 'avoid', 'being', 'stupid', 'standard', 'pitfall', 'genre', 'suspect', 'are', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'way', 'things', 'get', 'resolved', 'end', 'also', 'think', 'was', 'nice', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'quot', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'quot', 'quot', 'Girl', 'PEarl', 'Earring', 'quot', 'then', 'least', 'got', 'do', 'decent', 'quot', 'Matrix', 'quot', 'takeoff', 'film', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'Darius', 'Miles', 'who', 'went', 'pros', 'instead', 'attending', 'St.', 'Johns', 'University', 'play', 'character', 'who', 'opposite', 'ironic', 'see', 'Mike', 'Jarvis', 'play', 'had', 'been', 'fired', 'St.', 'Johns', 'post', 'time', 'quot', 'Perfect', 'Score', 'quot', 'was', 'released']",N/A

That they actually got a green-light for the project is amazing because the serious scenes manage to be hopelessly lame while falling short of being camp.  As the director began to actually visualize the product he panicked (with good reason) and began to add every hook he could to lure viewers (insert basketball star Darius Miles as a .......""basketball star"") including comedy and sexploitation.  Which was probably a good thing but is so poorly integrated into the story line that its commercial purpose is obvious.  Had they gone the full teen comedy route and made the serious scenes slightly more moronic they might have had a fairly entertaining satire of both genres.Leonardo Nam was added to the cast for comic relief.  He plays an Asian version of ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High's""  Jeff Spacoli.  But you have to watch his character closely because there is a lot of subtle physical humor going on that apparently escaped the notice of the director, who failed to emphasize it with close reaction shots-but it is there if you look closely at him in the wide shots.The obvious comparison is with ""Catch That Kid"", to which ""The Perfect Score"" finishes a poor second.  While that movie had an even less credible premise, the younger actors in it had a lot more charm than this group of overage teenagers.Sexploitation note:  The sexploitation is confined to the Scarlett Johansson character who does a nice reprise of a ""Matrix"" scene along with a few other more subtle but enjoyable bits.  Johansson actually made this movie just before she started work on ""Lost in Translation"" which helps explain why she consented to appear in this bomb.

Oh well, I haven't actually taken my SAT's yet (hello, I'm only 12, so unless I'm some genius it's impossible) but I think the movie was funny, I have older siblings who have both stressed over the SAT's, my older sister who just graduated this year saw the preview for this movie and she dragged me with her to the theater along with my best guy friend and her boyfriend. The movie was so funny! She saw it because she was worried about her SAT's and so was her boyfriend, they had already taken the PSAT's and gotten good scores but were still worried about the actual SAT's. Anyway, the movie had such hiliarious acting in it. Scarlett Johansen (who played Francesca) was like 10 times better in this than she was in Lost in Translation, I hate her as a blonde and that movie sucked, Erica Christensen did a really good job as Anna. I didn't mind Chris Evan's in Not Another Teen Movie but he did a much better job in this one. Leonardo Nam as Roy was hysterical! Bryan Greenberg did a great job as Matty and Darius Miles made a great Desmond.

This idea surely sounds interesting, and so are the names of the actors involved here, especially when Scarlett Johansson is among them. However, director's awfully trite, mediocre treatment completely ruined the central idea, and even Johansson, talented as she is, does not look like the same player you have seen in other better films that made her name famous.Actually Ms. Johansson, who looks nice as a punk girl Francesca, might be the only reason for you to watch the dull and unfunny film (though she is not top-billed). The six characters we see in `The Perfect Score' are just the six stereotypes we find in high school dramas - Chris Evan's character Kyle wants to be an architect and he has a best friend Matty (Bryan Greenberg). Yes, that sort of things, so you also see a stoner Roy (Leonardo Nam) who can be a brilliant genius when he wants to, and a nice Afro-American guy Desmond who wants to be a professional basket player. And meet Ms. Christensen's dead serious character whose mother is terribly obsessed with education. Finally cameo Matthew Lilard pops up as a concerned brother to one of them, playing the guitar, doing jam session with a hair dryer.The actors are doing their best, but with this weak script, whose story is deprived of its possibly edgy aspects, they can do nothing but repeating the tricks other actors had done in the high school comedies in the past. Everything looks like coming from some stock footage, and director Brian Robbins seems satisfied with this mildly entertaining portraits.As to the students' heist plans, it must be said that it is too perfunctory that even with the suspense of disbelief, it never interests and convinces us. At the end credit the film makes it clear that the people at ETS (responsible for the SAT tests) didn't participate in the making of the film. Maybe they should have, and told the filmmakers how they guard information about the tests or the files in their building. The six students can break into the building so easily, as if watered-down version of `Mission Impossible,' that watching them sneak into the institute is no fun at all.And the film has virtually nothing else to show us. The film is mildly amusing all through, and that's all I can say with confidence. `The Perfect Score' is so afraid of offending us with the initial concept, and you can feel it pulling punches.",2,Doesn't Score a Bull's Eye: Mildly Entertaining But Trite and Forgettable,1150070400,"06 12, 2006",2006,2447,"['Six', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'plan', 'steal', 'answers', 'upcoming', 'SAT', 'tests', 'idea', 'surely', 'interesting', 'so', 'are', 'names', 'actors', 'involved', 'here', 'especially', 'when', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'However', 'director', 'awfully', 'trite', 'mediocre', 'treatment', 'completely', 'ruined', 'central', 'idea', 'even', 'Johansson', 'talented', 'not', 'look', 'same', 'player', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'better', 'films', 'made', 'name', 'famous.Actually', 'Ms.', 'Johansson', 'who', 'nice', 'punk', 'girl', 'Francesca', 'might', 'be', 'only', 'reason', 'watch', 'dull', 'unfunny', 'film', 'not', 'top-billed', 'six', 'characters', 'see', 'Perfect', 'Score', 'are', 'just', 'six', 'stereotypes', 'find', 'high', 'school', 'dramas', 'Chris', 'Evan', 'character', 'Kyle', 'be', 'architect', 'best', 'friend', 'Matty', 'Bryan', 'Greenberg', 'Yes', 'sort', 'things', 'also', 'see', 'stoner', 'Roy', 'Leonardo', 'Nam', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'brilliant', 'genius', 'when', 'nice', 'Afro-American', 'guy', 'Desmond', 'who', 'be', 'professional', 'basket', 'player', 'meet', 'Ms.', 'Christensen', 'dead', 'serious', 'character', 'mother', 'terribly', 'obsessed', 'education', 'Finally', 'cameo', 'Matthew', 'Lilard', 'up', 'concerned', 'brother', 'one', 'playing', 'guitar', 'doing', 'jam', 'session', 'hair', 'dryer.The', 'actors', 'are', 'doing', 'best', 'weak', 'script', 'story', 'deprived', 'possibly', 'edgy', 'aspects', 'can', 'do', 'nothing', 'repeating', 'tricks', 'other', 'actors', 'had', 'done', 'high', 'school', 'comedies', 'past', 'Everything', 'looks', 'coming', 'stock', 'footage', 'director', 'Brian', 'Robbins', 'satisfied', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'portraits.As', 'students', 'heist', 'plans', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'too', 'perfunctory', 'even', 'suspense', 'disbelief', 'never', 'interests', 'convinces', 'end', 'credit', 'film', 'clear', 'people', 'ETS', 'responsible', 'SAT', 'tests', 'did', ""n't"", 'participate', 'making', 'film', 'Maybe', 'should', 'have', 'told', 'filmmakers', 'how', 'guard', 'information', 'tests', 'files', 'building', 'six', 'students', 'can', 'break', 'building', 'so', 'easily', 'watered-down', 'version', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'watching', 'sneak', 'institute', 'fun', 'film', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'else', 'show', 'film', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'can', 'say', 'confidence', 'Perfect', 'Score', 'so', 'afraid', 'offending', 'initial', 'concept', 'can', 'feel', 'pulling', 'punches']",N/A
