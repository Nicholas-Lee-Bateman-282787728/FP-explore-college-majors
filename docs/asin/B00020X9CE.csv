820781,A1UD9T4T8A6H1A,B00020X9CE,Joel Jankiewicz,"[6, 7]","I bought the DVD box set for the series, and decided that I would give this compilation movie a try. What are the results?The movie itself is ok, it's good but not perfect. Alot of the footage from the series has been modified for the movie, but there is also scenes specifically for the movie, which makes it a bit more original. The story is very different from the series, and it's ending is a bit of a shocker. Don't worry, it's not a bad ending like you'd see on most Outer Limits episodes, but it'll leave you feeling weird.The story mostly focuses on Yuji and Marlene, and pretty much rightfully so, since those are the two main characters. However, the draw back to that is that we don't see many wonderful characters that were in the series. Some roles for characters are even switched around a bit.This movie goes to at least 95 minutes. This is I think another small weakness for the movie. If there was an extra 10 to maybe 20 minutes, the movie could've played out a bit better. Like the series, it's not without some weaknesses, but they aren't overpowering.But on the plus side, you get most of the story in one setting, alot of action, and a fairly decent romance between Yuji and Marlene. Unlike the series, this movie has no fan service at all, which makes it more friendly to viewers in one way. But the violence and dark aspect of the movie go up as a result.Overall, this is a fairly decent compilation movie. Fans of Blue Gender who want to get everything about it will probably get this movie to complete their collections. I myself like Blue Gender, and getting this movie in my opinion was well worth it. However, if you see the movie first, it may seem different, and especially more so if you've seen the series first. If you're new to Blue Gender, it is mostly better to see the series first, then see the movie, even though this is one 95 minute setting. If you are unsure, rent it first if you can before you buy it.",4,"Blue Gender: The Warrior - Good compilation, but not perfect",1096416000,"09 29, 2004",2004,1946,"['bought', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'series', 'decided', 'would', 'give', 'compilation', 'movie', 'try', 'What', 'are', 'results', 'movie', 'ok', 'good', 'not', 'perfect', 'Alot', 'footage', 'series', 'been', 'modified', 'movie', 'also', 'scenes', 'specifically', 'movie', 'bit', 'more', 'original', 'story', 'very', 'different', 'series', 'ending', 'bit', 'shocker', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'not', 'bad', 'ending', ""'d"", 'see', 'most', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'episodes', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'feeling', 'weird.The', 'story', 'mostly', 'Yuji', 'Marlene', 'pretty', 'much', 'rightfully', 'so', 'are', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'However', 'draw', 'back', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'many', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'were', 'series', 'roles', 'characters', 'are', 'even', 'switched', 'bit.This', 'movie', 'least', '95', 'minutes', 'think', 'small', 'weakness', 'movie', 'was', 'extra', '10', 'maybe', '20', 'minutes', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'played', 'out', 'bit', 'better', 'series', 'not', 'weaknesses', 'are', ""n't"", 'overpowering.But', 'plus', 'side', 'get', 'most', 'story', 'one', 'setting', 'alot', 'action', 'fairly', 'decent', 'romance', 'Yuji', 'Marlene', 'series', 'movie', 'fan', 'service', 'more', 'friendly', 'viewers', 'one', 'way', 'violence', 'dark', 'aspect', 'movie', 'go', 'up', 'as', 'result.Overall', 'fairly', 'decent', 'compilation', 'movie', 'Fans', 'Blue', 'Gender', 'who', 'want', 'get', 'everything', 'will', 'probably', 'get', 'movie', 'complete', 'collections', 'Blue', 'Gender', 'getting', 'movie', 'opinion', 'was', 'well', 'worth', 'However', 'see', 'movie', 'first', 'may', 'seem', 'different', 'especially', 'more', 'so', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'series', 'first', ""'re"", 'new', 'Blue', 'Gender', 'mostly', 'better', 'see', 'series', 'first', 'then', 'see', 'movie', 'even', 'one', '95', 'minute', 'setting', 'are', 'unsure', 'rent', 'first', 'can', 'buy']",Blue Gender: The Warrior

I bought the movie in hopes of finishing it, since anime's a very expensive hobby, even going mainstream (I fear for the state of anime, what with people believing in dragon ball which is at least a 16 year old franchise).The movie left a sour taste in my mouth, and my wallet. It reeks with ""bargain"". I'm gonna go save up and buy the series set hopefully someday. Characters I grew attached to, such as cute little Yung and Marlene's original retrieval team, die without much character development. Their deaths in the series gave more impact after knowing more about them. I regret buying this, so as everyone else says, BUY/SEE THE SERIES, AVOID THIS, unless you're die-hard to collect it all. This only worth seeing, not keeping, if you have the series.",3,"Wow...great in some areas, weak in others=cancels itself out",1115769600,"05 11, 2005",2005,845,"['saw', 'part', 'series', 'fell', 'love', 'Too', 'bad', 'was', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'bought', 'movie', 'hopes', 'finishing', 'anime', 'very', 'expensive', 'hobby', 'even', 'going', 'mainstream', 'fear', 'state', 'anime', 'what', 'people', 'believing', 'dragon', 'ball', 'least', '16', 'year', 'old', 'franchise', '.The', 'movie', 'left', 'sour', 'taste', 'mouth', 'wallet', 'bargain', ""'m"", 'gon', 'go', 'save', 'up', 'buy', 'series', 'set', 'hopefully', 'someday', 'Characters', 'grew', 'attached', 'such', 'cute', 'little', 'Yung', 'Marlene', 'original', 'retrieval', 'team', 'die', 'much', 'character', 'development', 'deaths', 'series', 'gave', 'more', 'impact', 'knowing', 'more', 'regret', 'buying', 'so', 'everyone', 'else', 'BUY/SEE', 'THE', 'SERIES', 'AVOID', 'THIS', ""'re"", 'die-hard', 'collect', 'only', 'worth', 'seeing', 'not', 'keeping', 'have', 'series']",Blue Gender: The Warrior

Did not work very well at all. So much of the emotion leading the characters throughout the movie is nonexistant. The whole explanation of the B-virus and the reason behind the blue has no part in this film either.

820784,A3FIKATQ286DMV,B00020X9CE,Niko,"[8, 8]","Having watched all the series and the movie called the ""Warrior"", my suggestion would be:First of all, buy the box set called: `Blue Gender-The complete collection' for the following reasons:- In this box set, you will have the entire series and the movie as a bonus- It is definitely cheaper- And lasts for about 750 min.As for the shows, I wrote a detailed review in the `Blue Gender-The complete collection', where you can read everything. In one word, the series are: AMAZING!!! And highly recommended...As the movie concerns it is basically, something like a short version of the series. In other words, they try to put about 600 minutes into 95. Not to mention that many things that build up the story are left outside (for obvious reasons) and that the ending is completely different from the series. Moreover, by watching the movie the viewer will get the impression that the series are not deep etc. an opinion that will change for sure if he or she will watch the series.As for the storyline:In the near future, the main character, Yuji Kaido, has been diagnosed, as other ordinary people, in having an incurable disease. Because there was no cure available at that time they put him with the others alike into hibernation, supposed for a time span of two years. Unfortunately for them, in the mean time Earth got invaded by alien bucks, called ""Blue"" and most humans got killed. For this reason, humans retreated to a space station called Second Earth. A few decades later, Yuji was awakened by a soldier among other commrades, who was sent down on earth to find the ""sleepers"" (and there is a reason for it), in other words the ones that had been put into hibernation. The soldier was no other than Marlene Angel, who is the other main character of the show. In the mists of war, a love story will start to evolve around these two main protagonists who will have to go through various dangers and do everything to survive and to safe the world (well, what is left of it). The story has many twists and although it refers to a (near)future time the messeges that this show ""sends out"" are all the ones that we are facing nowadays, like the environment, human behavior towards others, military/political power games etc. In the show we see a possible outcome of our actions.To sum up:Buy this DVD only if you are a huge Blue Gender fan, so that to have a complete collection. Therefore, if you are not sure what to do, rent this movie first before you decide (if of course you have such an option).My recommendation  would be, to buy the complete collection of the series, where the movie is included; and is definitely cheaper.I hope I could help....",3,NOT AS GOOD AS THE SERIES,1146960000,"05 7, 2006",2006,2661,"['Having', 'watched', 'series', 'movie', 'called', 'Warrior', 'suggestion', 'would', 'be', 'First', 'buy', 'box', 'set', 'called', 'Gender-The', 'complete', 'collection', 'following', 'reasons', 'box', 'set', 'will', 'have', 'entire', 'series', 'movie', 'bonus-', 'definitely', 'cheaper-', '750', 'min.As', 'shows', 'wrote', 'detailed', 'review', 'Blue', 'Gender-The', 'complete', 'collection', 'where', 'can', 'read', 'everything', 'one', 'word', 'series', 'are', 'AMAZING', 'highly', 'recommended', 'movie', 'concerns', 'basically', 'something', 'short', 'version', 'series', 'other', 'words', 'try', 'put', '600', 'minutes', '95', 'Not', 'mention', 'many', 'things', 'build', 'up', 'story', 'are', 'left', 'outside', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'ending', 'completely', 'different', 'series', 'Moreover', 'watching', 'movie', 'viewer', 'will', 'get', 'impression', 'series', 'are', 'not', 'deep', 'etc', 'opinion', 'will', 'change', 'sure', 'will', 'watch', 'series.As', 'storyline', 'near', 'future', 'main', 'character', 'Yuji', 'Kaido', 'been', 'diagnosed', 'other', 'ordinary', 'people', 'having', 'incurable', 'disease', 'was', 'cure', 'available', 'time', 'put', 'others', 'alike', 'hibernation', 'supposed', 'time', 'span', 'two', 'years', 'Unfortunately', 'mean', 'time', 'Earth', 'got', 'invaded', 'alien', 'bucks', 'called', 'Blue', 'most', 'humans', 'got', 'killed', 'reason', 'humans', 'retreated', 'space', 'station', 'called', 'Second', 'Earth', 'A', 'few', 'decades', 'later', 'Yuji', 'was', 'awakened', 'soldier', 'other', 'commrades', 'who', 'was', 'sent', 'down', 'earth', 'find', 'sleepers', 'reason', 'other', 'words', 'ones', 'had', 'been', 'put', 'hibernation', 'soldier', 'was', 'other', 'Marlene', 'Angel', 'who', 'other', 'main', 'character', 'show', 'mists', 'war', 'love', 'story', 'will', 'start', 'evolve', 'two', 'main', 'protagonists', 'who', 'will', 'have', 'go', 'various', 'dangers', 'do', 'everything', 'survive', 'safe', 'world', 'well', 'what', 'left', 'story', 'many', 'twists', 'future', 'time', 'messeges', 'show', 'out', 'are', 'ones', 'are', 'facing', 'nowadays', 'environment', 'human', 'behavior', 'towards', 'others', 'military/political', 'power', 'games', 'etc', 'show', 'see', 'possible', 'outcome', 'actions.To', 'up', 'Buy', 'DVD', 'only', 'are', 'huge', 'Blue', 'Gender', 'fan', 'so', 'have', 'complete', 'collection', 'Therefore', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'do', 'rent', 'movie', 'first', 'decide', 'course', 'have', 'option', '.My', 'recommendation', 'would', 'be', 'buy', 'complete', 'collection', 'series', 'where', 'movie', 'included', 'definitely', 'cheaper.I', 'hope', 'could', 'help']",Blue Gender: The Warrior
