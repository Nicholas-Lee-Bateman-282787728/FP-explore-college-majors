Overall, I think it is a pretty good set-up - the filming & instruction is very easy to follow & pleasing to watch. The two instructors show modifications for both strength & flexibility, which was helpful.My main disappointment with this DVD is that I had really hoped it would be more challenging. The 10 minute segments end up being too short for me, especially because the actual ""workout"" is very short & they spend a lot more time stretching at the end of each segment. I think it would be a lot better if there were more repetitions and a few more moves in each segment. There are five 10 minute segments, so you can mix them together - but even after the 50 minutes, I mostly just felt loosened up/well-stretched, when what I was really wishing for was to feel a bit fatigued/sore.I would say this is a great DVD for beginners who don't have a lot of time or to add on to the end of a more complete workout for some stretching.",3,Could be a bit more challenging...,1275696000,"06 5, 2010",2010,1016,"['first', 'Exhale', 'Core', 'Fusion', 'dvd', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'Overall', 'think', 'pretty', 'good', 'set-up', 'filming', 'instruction', 'very', 'easy', 'follow', 'pleasing', 'watch', 'two', 'instructors', 'show', 'modifications', 'strength', 'flexibility', 'was', 'helpful.My', 'main', 'disappointment', 'DVD', 'had', 'really', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'challenging', '10', 'minute', 'segments', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'too', 'short', 'especially', 'actual', 'workout', 'very', 'short', 'spend', 'lot', 'more', 'time', 'stretching', 'end', 'segment', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'better', 'were', 'more', 'repetitions', 'few', 'more', 'moves', 'segment', 'are', 'five', '10', 'minute', 'segments', 'can', 'mix', 'together', 'even', '50', 'minutes', 'mostly', 'just', 'felt', 'loosened', 'up/well-stretched', 'when', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'wishing', 'was', 'feel', 'bit', 'fatigued/sore.I', 'would', 'say', 'great', 'DVD', 'beginners', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'time', 'add', 'end', 'more', 'complete', 'workout', 'stretching']",EXHALE: CORE FUSION PILATES PLUS
1169266,A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0,B001AZI23G,"Deb Nam-Krane ""dnkboston""","[89, 94]","The creators of this DVD- and the Core Fusion program at Exhale Spa- were instructors for the Lotte Berk Method years ago.  As such, there program has the same elements- ballet exercises (they demonstrate with a chair instead of a barre), yoga, Pilates and orthopedic exercises.  This release emphasizes more yoga (lots of planks and stretches) and their take on Pilates principles (they fall into the ""tuck"" school vs. the neutral spine).  Based on the clips of the companion Body Sculpt release, it looks as if that one emphasizes more of the ballet work.Others have criticized the amount of stretches in this and other Lotte Berk Method derivatives, but I think that's one of the method's strengths (no pun intended).  I like that they integrate the stretches into the sets so they are difficult to skip- people don't stretch enough, particularly through their hips- but I'd prefer that they both waited a breath or two longer before the stretches began and held them for a longer period of time.This release contains no weights- ""just"" body resistance.  They more than make up for that with a long plank sequence and their variant on Knee Dancing (who knew that could work your obliques so well?).  The star of the release is probably going to be Pure Core segment.  While they include some classics like the Roll Up and some crunch variants (my least favorite ever), it's their take on the flat back work that might leave you breathless.  First they start with a rounded back in a seated position then move the legs together, bent, straight, on the ground, and lifted, with variations of all.  Then they do the same against a wall.  This tough, and you'll feel your abs as well as your upper body and quads.I thought this was a challenging practice, but maybe a little too much.  Although the creators take turns showing modifications- he shows the ones demanding more strength, and she shows the ones showing more flexibility- much of what they show would still be too much for a lot of people.  Maybe they should have added a third modifier as the Lotte Berk releases did so everyone would feel like they could participate.This is very challenging, and many people who already like barre workouts will enjoy the abdominal section.",4,Another take on the Lotte Berk Method,1228867200,"12 10, 2008",2008,2237,"['creators', 'DVD-', 'Core', 'Fusion', 'program', 'Exhale', 'Spa-', 'were', 'instructors', 'Lotte', 'Berk', 'Method', 'years', 'ago', 'such', 'program', 'same', 'elements-', 'ballet', 'exercises', 'demonstrate', 'chair', 'instead', 'barre', 'yoga', 'Pilates', 'orthopedic', 'exercises', 'release', 'more', 'yoga', 'lots', 'planks', 'stretches', 'take', 'Pilates', 'principles', 'fall', 'tuck', 'school', 'neutral', 'spine', 'Based', 'clips', 'companion', 'Body', 'Sculpt', 'release', 'one', 'more', 'ballet', 'work.Others', 'have', 'criticized', 'amount', 'stretches', 'other', 'Lotte', 'Berk', 'Method', 'derivatives', 'think', 'one', 'method', 'strengths', 'pun', 'intended', 'like', 'integrate', 'stretches', 'sets', 'are', 'difficult', 'skip-', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'stretch', 'enough', 'particularly', 'hips-', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'waited', 'breath', 'two', 'longer', 'stretches', 'began', 'held', 'longer', 'period', 'time.This', 'release', 'weights-', 'just', 'body', 'resistance', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'long', 'plank', 'sequence', 'variant', 'Knee', 'Dancing', 'who', 'knew', 'could', 'work', 'obliques', 'so', 'well', 'star', 'release', 'probably', 'going', 'be', 'Pure', 'Core', 'segment', 'include', 'classics', 'Roll', 'Up', 'crunch', 'variants', 'least', 'favorite', 'ever', 'take', 'flat', 'back', 'work', 'might', 'leave', 'breathless', 'First', 'start', 'rounded', 'back', 'seated', 'position', 'then', 'move', 'legs', 'together', 'bent', 'straight', 'ground', 'lifted', 'variations', 'Then', 'do', 'same', 'wall', 'tough', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'abs', 'as', 'well', 'upper', 'body', 'quads.I', 'thought', 'was', 'challenging', 'practice', 'maybe', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'creators', 'take', 'turns', 'showing', 'modifications-', 'ones', 'demanding', 'more', 'strength', 'ones', 'showing', 'more', 'flexibility-', 'much', 'what', 'show', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'lot', 'people', 'Maybe', 'should', 'have', 'added', 'third', 'modifier', 'Lotte', 'Berk', 'did', 'so', 'everyone', 'would', 'feel', 'could', 'participate.This', 'very', 'challenging', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'already', 'barre', 'workouts', 'will', 'enjoy', 'abdominal', 'section']",EXHALE: CORE FUSION PILATES PLUS

1169270,A2AC3VJPUZS42C,B001AZI23G,Jenny G,"[10, 11]","Due to knee problems, I have not tried the thighs and glutes routine, but I have really enjoyed the routines I have used:Upper Body Core: This is a series of plank variations (forearm, full, pushup) and tricep dips followed by stretching.  About half of it is stretching, but I didn't have a problem with that.Flat Back/Rounded Back: I had initially not used this routine, but was intrigued when I had seen comments on another site about how difficult this routine is to do correctly (e.g. feeling it more in the lower back or hip flexor instead of isolating the lower abs).  So, I had to try it.  I'm not sure if I would have done the routine correctly when I first started to use the DVD, but I really like this now.  It is a great workout for the lower abs!! If your abs are not very strong yet, you may wish to skip the portions where your back is flat against the wall, and work into it.Pure Core:  I LOVE this segment.  I was doing my own ab routines and was very bored with them. So, I've added this routine in three days a week.  It is a lot more intense than basic crunches and I have noticed that my abs have tightened and become a lot stronger.  I have posterior innominate rotation on my left and have found that this routine combined with other exercises I do has really helped stablize my Core. I also really like the challenge this segment provides - as you become more advanced you can rely less on keeping your hands on your thighs for support. This is my favorite segment.Stretch Core:  I also really, really like this segment.  The stretch segment focuses mostly on the lower back, with some stretching of the hamstring and inner thigh.  I have a combination of lower back and hip problems, and have found this stretching routine to be very helpful.  This does not replace my basic lower body stretching routine that I do each day as it doesn't target everything, but if you have lower back problems I think this could be very helpful. I have been doing this stretch routine 3-4 days a week.Update for Thighs & Glutes:  I waited several weeks after getting out of PT for my knee and began to use the barre style thigh routines.  They have helped my knee a lot. I was worried about them at first, but making sure I follow their instructions on form it has helped with my quadriceps and inner thighs.",5,Love it!!

I am fairly new to pilates, but I have spent most of my life dancing, gymnastics, working out so I'm definitely not new to the ways of working out.  I like to learn new things & new workouts and I have heard many positives about pilates so I said, what the heck, I'll try it out.  This is my 3rd pilates dvd and I love it.  I got thru most of the dvd without dying or losing pace.  I did sweat and got my heart rate up which was good.  The instructors explained everything and were pleasant and background music was very light.  I hate strong, overpowering music with pilates... I'll keep that for kickboxing or running! lol!  I did the entire workout and there were some moves I just could not do.  But being it was my first time using the dvd, I know eventually I will catch up.  I could really feel my core muscles in use the entire video which I loved.  And today at work I can actually move around without looking like I'm turning 100 y/o tomorrow lol!  And ya know what?  Ater just one workout I already feel a difference in my skirts!  No kidding!  I'm thrilled and I can't wait to see what kind of diff I'm going to see in my body in a month!!!  I'm not concerned with weight, but I want to see inches melt away,  and I think that is exactly what I'll see here.  I can't wait to move on to some of the other dvds as well to mix it up once I've done them all.  Good luck and I really think you will get results and enjoy this dvd.  Unless you are a pilates junkie, gym rat or the like...I don't think there will ever be a dvd good enough for them unless they make their own.

It's also great if you're sick of doing crunches and squats. The thigh exercises are lengthening and work your smallest muscles for toning and shaping.The ""pure core"" section is my favorite, and I have a very weak core. I made it through feeling challenged (resting a couple times) but not overwhelmed. Also, after a few sessions, I walked around with a very different, pulled-in feeling deep in my abs and back. I see a noticeable difference when I am running too and catch my profile in reflection. It's so much flatter and pulled in, like it should be! I was impressed.

I do 1-2 segments weekly tacked onto other exercise, so it's really easy to fit into my routine and I've found these to be quite intense bursts.  I'm sure the whole video done at once would feel energizing from head to toe.I've been doing pilates for 10 years and no longer have time to attend classes.  I'm sure the Exhale classes are great in person, but I don't have much time or the $35 per class to go to them!  I've done a few barre videos in my day, many are forgettable.  I just can't get into Callanetics or Lotte Berk, the videos I've done for them I've dubbed ""body-perfecting barre-torture DVDs"" full of weird thrusting and repetition.  Not so with this DVD!The instruction is in clear voice over.  The instructors, who I found out are married but the chemistry is very low-key, are attractive without being intimidating and they even keep their abs covered so I'm not sad I'll never look like that and can focus on the strengthening benefits I'm getting.  Most importantly, they have very grounding voices and guidance.The segments are divided by what part of the body is being worked.  The one focused on pure core was brutal in a good way, and I found the glutes one remarkable as I felt muscles I didn't know I had working.  The moves seem to have a deep impact!  They balance each section with a walking-in-place warmup and a stretch, and the final stretch is very relaxing.This is, bottom-line, user-friendly.

I have every single Core Fusion DVD, and I love them all, although they are each a little different.  Body Sculpt and Long and Lean are both full body workouts, the latter a little more challenging than the former.  Both Arms and Abs and Thighs and Glutes are self-explanatory.  Pilates Plus focuses on abs/core work.  And the yoga Energy Flow and the Bootcamp DVDs are cardio workouts, the latter more challenging than the former, although both are quite rigorous and will make you sweat buckets.  I have taken both Pilates Mat and Pilates Fusion classes for a few years, and these DVDs are a wonderful complement when I am not in class, and in my opinion, are sometimes even more challenging than what I get in my exercise classes.  I have tried a number of different exercise DVDs over the years, and these are the only ones I have ever stuck with.  They are very enjoyable, challenging (but not so challenging that you give up), invigorating, interesting (they do not get boring because there is so much variety built in), and I have noticed some subtle differences in my body from my work with both the DVDs and my classes.  To really burn fat, though, you have to alter your diet. These DVDs will help with sculpting muscle (like a ballet dancer's body), but not so much with fat loss (at least I have always found that my weight loss occurs with diet and not with exercise, but that's just me.)

1169285,A1T6VABQU7RBMA,B001AZI23G,T. Carr,"[7, 7]","The Exhale Core Fusion dvd series are some of the best workout dvds I've found and this is no exception. Be warned that there are no traditional pilates exercises here, but it is a solid mix of strengthening and flexibility enhancing (challenging!) exercises. There are 5 10 minute chapters (and 2 bonuses from their other dvds). The 5 main workouts include:Upper Body Core: lots of planks, push ups, and reverse pushups. I find this pretty challenging, even doing modifications, but my upper body is fairly weak.Thigh & Gluteus Core: Starts with variations on kneeling & leaning back which really gets your quads working. There's also different leg lifts when on hands/knees. Some additional stretches like spinal twists, cat/cow, etc. Challenging but do-able.Flat Back/Round Back Core: This is one of the more unique sections. You sit with your legs out (either straight or bent, it switches) and do variations of lifting the legs and opening and closing them. Towards the end your legs are up at a higher angle, almost in a pike position (leaning against a wall for stability). Works all parts of your thighs, glutes and abs.Pure Core: Also unique. It's all abs here but you're not doing 800 crunches. You basically hold one crunch the entire time, moving your arms in different ways and twisting your body. This section is impossible. I last only a minute or two before I have to modify their modifications and I consider my core fairly strong. If you get through this without any modification you are a master. I love it though, it gives me something to work toward.Core Flexibility: A mix of resting, leg stretches, and back/ab stretches such as twists and a bridge.My only complaint with the dvd is that every segment begins with the same warmup (knee lift marches) which can get boring and repetitive quickly if you're doing all 50 minutes at once. A minor gripe though for what is really an excellent workout. This series is the only one I've found where I can honestly say one 10 minute segment still feels like a great workout, because of how intense it is. As a side note, this is also part of a 3 dvd set for the Core Fusion Series,Exhale: Core Fusion Collection.

I finally rented this recently after seeing the trailer, and I thought I could get past he robotic sounding voiceover, but knew it could be an issue.Within 5 minutes it reminds me of being in school where they suck the life out of you, or any idea of creativity, fun & enjoyment. The voices of Fred & Elizabeth are so devoid of emotion, they are robotic. Everything is said carefully & with the intention of only burning calories or strengthening muscles, there's no body awareness intention. Fred always has an uncomfortable or pained look & Elizabeth has also an uncomfortable fake smile most times.The production qualities are top notch, the expensive spa theme is beautiful, but too relaxing, it cemented with the voices of me wanting to sleep rather then move & the music is so bland I don't even notice it. Having Fred show the moderate to hard levels of the exercises while Elizabeth did the more modified versions was great.Workout Chapters:Upper Body Core - push ups, forearm planks, etc.Thigh & Gluteus Core - kneeling & leaning back with different arm movements, camel, cat/cow, hands/knees w/leg lifts, seated spinal twistFlat Back/Round Back Core - sitting & just lifting the legs straight or bent at different angles/degrees to work the abs & different parts of the gluts/thighs are great & more challenging then they look (really works great, good for while watching tv or on the phone!).Pure Core - crunches, holding crunches w/leg lifted static (really works great, good for while watching tv or on the phone!).Core Flexibility - resting at first, then yoga bridge, stright leg to face stretch, reclined yoga twists, etc.Bonus:Upper Body Challenge (5 min) - more plank & push ups, side plank & yoga star poseExhale: Core Fusion Body Sculpt  - Thigh Sculpt sectionAbout Core Fusion, About Exhale, Bios of Elisabeth Halfpapp & Fred DeVitoThe exercises themselves? Besides the robotic arm swing/knee lifts at the start of every section except the flexibility one to increase body temp & blood movement (wow, doesn't that sound FUN & motivating!?!??) are very good & challenging, but done on many other toning dvds. I was impressed by the Back & Pure Core sections that was more original.I know many will disagree who love these dvds that the voice is soothing, etc., but please, it's just an opinon & there is room in life for a difference of opinion as long as it's respectful.

I have struggled to find a workout that I could do, that was not painful, AND offered results. This is that workout.I own the other discs in theExhale: Core Fusion Collectionseries (I have pre-ordered the new ones) and they are also beneficial, but this is the best. It offers a wide range of exercises and stretches that are broken down into short workouts, or one workout that lasts about an hour. I choose to do the whole thing and never experience pain the following day.Every exercise has a counter stretch that un-does any tightness, soreness, or discomfort you might feel the next day. It also prevents bulking, instead giving a lean, toned look. I was also amazed at the speed of my progress.  Within two weeks I noticed definate improvement in my strength and flexibility (and a change in my body shape).I practice the stretches at the end of the workout on days when I am in lots of pain as they alleviate the pain in my lower back in ways I didn't think was possible. This workout has been better for me than the months of rehabilitation I received after my accident.",5,Great for lower back pain!

1169288,AWMU4C4CH21TE,B001AZI23G,YogaGirl,"[51, 70]","I just finished reviewing this dvd and I had to really think about whether or not I wanted to keep it.  You see, I'm a dance/yoga person.  I like creative movement with music and I like to enjoy myself while I exercise; and although this is a challenging dvd, I couldn't see myself doing it on a regular basis and enjoying it.  That said, here is what you can expect.Class takes place in a very nice spa-like room with 2 teachers.  You can see a video clip on youtube.  The instruction is in voice over and this is what annoyed me the most:  the cuing AND music did not match the movement.  You really have to be motivated to keep up as there is no to very little counting.  The voice over is not taught like a class.  It had the feel of a demonstration.There are 5 sections, 10 minutes each.  Each section except the last starts with knee lifts.  I was annoyed that the movement didn't match the music.  I would have rather had no music than to have off beat movement.The first section is upper body strength using forearm plank and pushups,and tricep dips.  The next section is thighs and glutes.  You can see this section on youtube.  The third section is pure ab work and it looks very hard.  I believe the fourth section is work at the wall.  This is the best section IMO.  If I were to keep this dvd, this is the section that I would do the most.  You sit against the wall and do leg raises, leg lifts, pike position, etc.After some thought I decided to send the dvd back. I was bored watching it.  I guess I am not a pilates person and I didn't like the way the material was presented.  As always with Acacia there is a music only option.  If you like pilates, then this dvd is for you.  If you are highly motivated and can count on your own, then this dvd is for you.  As for me.  I'm going to pass on it",3,Challenging but boring,1228089600,"12 1, 2008",2008,1812,"['just', 'finished', 'reviewing', 'dvd', 'had', 'really', 'think', 'not', 'wanted', 'keep', 'see', ""'m"", 'dance/yoga', 'person', 'like', 'creative', 'movement', 'music', 'like', 'enjoy', 'exercise', 'challenging', 'dvd', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'doing', 'regular', 'basis', 'enjoying', 'said', 'here', 'what', 'can', 'expect.Class', 'place', 'very', 'nice', 'spa-like', 'room', '2', 'teachers', 'can', 'see', 'video', 'clip', 'youtube', 'instruction', 'voice', 'what', 'most', 'cuing', 'music', 'did', 'not', 'match', 'movement', 'really', 'have', 'be', 'motivated', 'keep', 'up', 'very', 'little', 'counting', 'voice', 'over', 'not', 'taught', 'class', 'had', 'feel', 'are', '5', 'sections', '10', 'minutes', 'section', 'last', 'starts', 'knee', 'lifts', 'was', 'annoyed', 'movement', 'did', ""n't"", 'match', 'music', 'would', 'have', 'rather', 'had', 'music', 'have', 'off', 'beat', 'movement.The', 'first', 'section', 'upper', 'body', 'strength', 'using', 'forearm', 'plank', 'pushups', 'tricep', 'dips', 'next', 'section', 'thighs', 'glutes', 'can', 'see', 'section', 'youtube', 'third', 'section', 'pure', 'ab', 'work', 'very', 'hard', 'believe', 'fourth', 'section', 'work', 'wall', 'best', 'section', 'IMO', 'were', 'keep', 'dvd', 'section', 'would', 'do', 'most', 'sit', 'wall', 'do', 'leg', 'raises', 'leg', 'lifts', 'pike', 'position', 'thought', 'decided', 'send', 'dvd', 'back', 'was', 'bored', 'watching', 'guess', 'am', 'not', 'pilates', 'person', 'did', ""n't"", 'way', 'material', 'was', 'presented', 'always', 'Acacia', 'music', 'only', 'option', 'like', 'pilates', 'then', 'dvd', 'are', 'highly', 'motivated', 'can', 'count', 'own', 'then', 'dvd', ""'m"", 'going', 'pass']",EXHALE: CORE FUSION PILATES PLUS

My favorite segments are Upper body & Upper body challenge which is a 5 minute bonus, both consist of pushups , planks and side planks which I love , and stretches. I also think this is a pretty boring workout mainly because of the small movement lotte berk style exercises and the fact that half of every segments is basically stretching , also every segment starts with a lotte berk warm up which gets really annoying when you do all of the segments together ,  their second DVD (Body Sculpt) is better and a bit more challenging and there is a warm up only in the first segment. If you like lotte berk then you will probably like it but if you like pilates , you won't necessarily .",3,This is definitely not Pilates,1228348800,"12 4, 2008",2008,1026,"['DVD', 'not', 'favorite', 'mine', 'produced', 'instructed', 'very', 'well', 'people', 'should', 'know', 'pilates', 'DVD', 'are', 'only', '2', 'pilates', 'inspired', 'exercises', 'whole', 'workout', 'modified', 'hundred', 'roll', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'pushups', 'rest', 'DVD', 'lotte', 'berk', 'inspired', 'exercises', 'favorite', 'segments', 'are', 'Upper', 'body', 'Upper', 'body', 'challenge', '5', 'minute', 'bonus', 'consist', 'pushups', 'planks', 'side', 'planks', 'love', 'stretches', 'also', 'think', 'pretty', 'boring', 'workout', 'mainly', 'small', 'movement', 'lotte', 'berk', 'style', 'exercises', 'fact', 'half', 'segments', 'basically', 'stretching', 'also', 'segment', 'lotte', 'berk', 'warm', 'up', 'really', 'annoying', 'when', 'do', 'segments', 'together', 'second', 'DVD', 'Body', 'Sculpt', 'better', 'bit', 'more', 'challenging', 'warm', 'up', 'only', 'first', 'segment', 'like', 'lotte', 'berk', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'like', 'pilates', 'wo', ""n't"", 'necessarily']",EXHALE: CORE FUSION PILATES PLUS
