Do not look too closely at the gaping holes in this piece. Girl from a poor family must endure abuse from her drunken stepfather.  Yet, the heroin has a perfect boob job.She gets her ass kicked and his covered in bruises.  She returns from the nurses office to engage in some sex with her cell mate.  All of the black and blue marks have magically disappeared.She is also able to produce magic money (that comes from someplace) to get herself strung out on drugs.

1680247,AXO4PQU0XG3TG,B00GRZPRB4,Dwight,"[0, 1]","Watching this movie, I wondered why someone so sweet and pretty and clean looking as the lead actress kept doing nude scenes.  This movie is similar to those 70s exploitation films made in the Philippines and often starring Pam Grier in terms of cheap bare sets and spare dialogue and kind of nonsensical but horrible situations.And then the contradictions in the storyline made me think that this is the companion to I Spit On Your Grave which was famous in my high school years but I never watched until about a year ago and I advise that everyone wait til they are older to watch that movie.There is NO WAY that anyone would star in I Spit On Your Grave out of narcissism.  I think it was an act of kindness on the part of the female lead to further expose the lies about rape and blaming the victim by really showing brutality towards someone so pretty that you would have to be a real dirtbag to hurt them.That's why Sarah Malukul Lane is cast because you just want to smooth her hair back and buy her a creamy cable knit sweater not hurt her as she is repeatedly hurt in this movie.PLUS the people who hurt her also offer her a helping hand because they LIKE her so that is definitely addressing the claims by rapists and mutilators that actually they just had a bad day or they actually lurve their victims.This movie is more than its nude scenes but those nude scenes say a lot about the actress willing to make them because throughout she is really nice as a person and very vulnerable and she keeps being hurt as if - as the Chinese say - the sky has no eye.It's kind of stunning that three movies together tell a tale, make a statement about rape and respond to the excuses and lies of rapists and those who are pro-rape.In order, you should watchI Spit On Your GraveK-11 for Portia Doubleday's performanceand finally this movie, Jailbait.",3,the third in a tryptich about educating us on the lies about rape,1402704000,"06 14, 2014",2014,1850,"['Watching', 'movie', 'wondered', 'why', 'someone', 'so', 'sweet', 'pretty', 'clean', 'looking', 'lead', 'actress', 'kept', 'doing', 'nude', 'scenes', 'movie', 'similar', '70s', 'exploitation', 'films', 'made', 'Philippines', 'often', 'starring', 'Pam', 'Grier', 'terms', 'cheap', 'bare', 'sets', 'spare', 'dialogue', 'kind', 'nonsensical', 'horrible', 'situations.And', 'then', 'contradictions', 'storyline', 'made', 'think', 'companion', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'was', 'famous', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'never', 'watched', 'year', 'ago', 'advise', 'everyone', 'wait', 'are', 'older', 'watch', 'WAY', 'anyone', 'would', 'star', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'narcissism', 'think', 'was', 'act', 'kindness', 'part', 'female', 'lead', 'further', 'expose', 'lies', 'rape', 'blaming', 'victim', 'really', 'showing', 'brutality', 'towards', 'someone', 'so', 'pretty', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'real', 'dirtbag', 'hurt', 'them.That', 'why', 'Sarah', 'Malukul', 'Lane', 'cast', 'just', 'want', 'smooth', 'hair', 'back', 'buy', 'creamy', 'cable', 'knit', 'sweater', 'not', 'hurt', 'repeatedly', 'hurt', 'people', 'who', 'hurt', 'also', 'offer', 'helping', 'hand', 'LIKE', 'so', 'definitely', 'addressing', 'claims', 'rapists', 'mutilators', 'actually', 'just', 'had', 'bad', 'day', 'actually', 'lurve', 'victims.This', 'movie', 'more', 'nude', 'scenes', 'nude', 'scenes', 'say', 'lot', 'actress', 'willing', 'make', 'really', 'nice', 'person', 'very', 'vulnerable', 'being', 'hurt', 'Chinese', 'say', 'sky', 'eye.It', 'kind', 'stunning', 'three', 'movies', 'together', 'tell', 'tale', 'make', 'statement', 'rape', 'respond', 'excuses', 'lies', 'rapists', 'who', 'are', 'pro-rape.In', 'order', 'should', 'watchI', 'Spit', 'GraveK-11', 'Portia', 'Doubleday', 'performanceand', 'finally', 'movie', 'Jailbait']",Jailbait

Pretty much all the 'stock' action that one has come to expect and enjoy from the incarcerated females scenario are present: a 'wrongfully accused' heroine, the de-rigeur humiliating body cavity search, lotsa communal showers, a despicable warden, inter-racial tensions, lesbian love-ins, bad cafeteria food, AND full nudity abound.The lead actress (Sara Malakul Lane) does a credible job as the sexually abused teenager (with outstanding cello playing skills!) who gets 'sent up the river' after accidentally killing her lecherous step dad while he is in mid molestation mode - though her purported 17 yr old persona is somewhat challenged when she removes her clothes (which she does A LOT!) to reveal a body that looks like it's got a few more years on it than advertised (but is VERY pleasing to behold, nonetheless!). She's got great freckles, and can even act - as her 'character' must come to grips with the brutal realities of prison life.The plot moves forward with a satisfying predictability and decent performances all around - nothing really 'new' here - but then why mess with a successful formula?!
