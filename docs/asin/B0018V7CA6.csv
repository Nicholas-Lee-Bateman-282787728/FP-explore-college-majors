Being a curious sort, and always living in the hope of finding movies to collect for future viewings, I decided to give it a chance (learning that Julie Newmar was in the cast was the deciding factor).I was more than pleasantly surprised (they had me with the streetlights/fans/girders): loved the art direction/set design.  Filled with in-jokes of the hit or miss variety (some brought out a laugh, some were groans), this was a standard plot for Westerns.  The prodigal son reluctantly returns to his home town and he's not warmly welcomed by the residents.  That alone wouldn't have been enough to hold my interest, it was the rest, the odd bits that popped up now and then, that made me enjoy this romp through the wild west (after taking a turn through The Twilight Zone first).Loved most of the characters but especially Julie Newmar as Miss Kitty and Meg Foster as Stell Barr.  The only two clinkers in the cast were Musetta Vander as Lash and George Takei as Doc Valentine (trading on his time with Star Trek).  They crossed too far over the line and went from being caricatures to just plain grotesque.  The problem with this type of humor is that it works, because everyone is in on the joke, or it doesn't, because it misses being funny by a smile.  ""Jim....Beam me up.""  Or the Bingo sequence during a funeral, funny once, but they just wouldn't let it go.  That's the only fault I could find with this piece; knowing and not knowing when to let a joke settle in on its own.I liked it, I'm keeping it, and I'm looking forward to watching it again sometime.",5,"""You got your killings for all the right reasons, I hope you're happy!""",1312416000,"08 4, 2011",2011,1646,"[""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'movie', 'popped', 'up', 'recommendations', 'Amazon', 'Being', 'curious', 'sort', 'always', 'living', 'hope', 'finding', 'movies', 'collect', 'future', 'viewings', 'decided', 'give', 'chance', 'learning', 'Julie', 'Newmar', 'was', 'cast', 'was', 'deciding', 'factor', '.I', 'was', 'more', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'had', 'streetlights/fans/girders', 'loved', 'art', 'direction/set', 'design', 'Filled', 'in-jokes', 'hit', 'miss', 'variety', 'brought', 'out', 'laugh', 'were', 'groans', 'was', 'standard', 'plot', 'Westerns', 'prodigal', 'son', 'reluctantly', 'home', 'town', 'not', 'warmly', 'welcomed', 'residents', 'alone', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'enough', 'hold', 'interest', 'was', 'rest', 'odd', 'bits', 'popped', 'up', 'now', 'then', 'made', 'enjoy', 'romp', 'wild', 'west', 'taking', 'turn', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'first', '.Loved', 'most', 'characters', 'especially', 'Julie', 'Newmar', 'Miss', 'Kitty', 'Meg', 'Foster', 'Stell', 'Barr', 'only', 'two', 'clinkers', 'cast', 'were', 'Musetta', 'Vander', 'Lash', 'George', 'Takei', 'Doc', 'Valentine', 'trading', 'time', 'Star', 'Trek', 'crossed', 'too', 'far', 'line', 'went', 'being', 'caricatures', 'just', 'plain', 'grotesque', 'problem', 'type', 'humor', 'everyone', 'joke', ""n't"", 'being', 'funny', 'smile', 'Jim', '.Beam', 'up', 'Bingo', 'sequence', 'funeral', 'funny', 'once', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'only', 'fault', 'could', 'find', 'piece', 'knowing', 'not', 'knowing', 'when', 'let', 'joke', 'settle', 'own.I', 'liked', ""'m"", 'keeping', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'again', 'sometime']",N/A
