1160924,A1QL89RQ6OGHIC,B0018S5MQ0,Ann McArthur,"[0, 0]","I was able to see the entire series in one week--all 65 episodes and it was the BEST!  Starting from the beginning right through to the end, I could see very well how their friendship evolved.  The show was action-packed.  Brian Keith gave his all and did a lot for a man his age. Daniel Hugh Kelly kept up with Keith every step of the way and his love of life combined with Keith's 'gruffness' was infectious.  You've got to make sure you watch ""In the Eye of the Beholder"", episode 62/63--hilarious and written & directed by Mr. Kelly...I too absolutely loved the last episode where they are stuck in jail (again) and tell each other how they really feel about the other, plain and simple.  It's because of this show that I've become interested in Brian's and Daniel's other movie & TV roles.Get it, Get it, Get it....DON'T wait.",5,What a great series...,1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,831,"['was', 'able', 'see', 'entire', 'series', 'one', 'week', '65', 'episodes', 'was', 'BEST', 'Starting', 'beginning', 'right', 'end', 'could', 'see', 'very', 'well', 'how', 'friendship', 'evolved', 'show', 'was', 'action-packed', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'gave', 'did', 'lot', 'man', 'age', 'Daniel', 'Hugh', 'Kelly', 'kept', 'up', 'Keith', 'step', 'way', 'love', 'life', 'combined', 'Keith', ""'gruffness"", 'was', 'infectious', ""'ve"", 'got', 'make', 'sure', 'watch', 'Eye', 'Beholder', 'episode', '62/63', 'hilarious', 'written', 'directed', 'Mr', 'Kelly', 'too', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'last', 'episode', 'where', 'are', 'stuck', 'jail', 'again', 'tell', 'other', 'how', 'really', 'feel', 'other', 'plain', 'simple', 'show', ""'ve"", 'become', 'interested', 'Brian', 'Daniel', 'other', 'movie', 'TV', 'roles.Get', 'Get', 'Get', '.DO', ""N'T"", 'wait']",Hardcastle and McCormick: The Complete Series

Keith & Kelly have greatchemistry as a Judge trying to straighten out an x-conby having him move in & solve some old cases that gotaway from him in court. The theme song changed in the2nd season to some lame happy type song but later waschanged back to the original ""drive' theme. I alwaysloved that song. I don't remember too many of theseas I never got to see them in reruns but they areas great as I remember. This is a classic example ofhow great TV was without all the CSI blood guts & sexon tv today. If you like 70-80's type action tv showsthis is a great overlooked series.

And all these years later, I still love it:) I hadn't seen an episode since it went off the air back in 86, and watching it now brings back a flood of memories. I feel 12 again, and that car is just the icing on the cake. The box set was great and nicely priced. The only problem I have, and its probably just me because I'm just picky, is I wished they couldve added some bonus material, like bloopers (they are always a fave for me), interviews (hey I know Brian Keith is dead now), behind the scenes, ya name it. I know you probably think I'm just a little too picky, but that wouldve been the best.
