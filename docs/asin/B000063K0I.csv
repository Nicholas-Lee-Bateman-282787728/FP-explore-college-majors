It is about resistance to a dictator, a woman's (and women's) liberation, and about the real meaning of what loss of freedom in a society means. Directed by Mariano Barrroso, the movie, spanning almost three decades, chronicles the life of a resistance movement leader, Minerva Mirabal (Salma Hayek), in the Dominican Republic, and her various confrontations with dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo (Edward James Olmos), who ruled that island nation with an iron hand from 1930 till his assassination in 1961. The movie focuses on his obsession with her and his attempts over many years to make her his mistress, bent on revenge when all his attempts prove futile. The movie implies that it was his frequent practice to visit the country, pick a young woman that filled his ""eye,"" and then entice her to his palace for a dance. Many young women were thus impregnated and packed to Miami or other resting place afterwards. Minerva has the courage to resist, thus paying the price--her father's murder, and the imprisonment of her and her sisters. Miranda becomes the leader of an underground freedom movement under the code-name ""the butterfly."" Eventually, she is assassinated by his thugs, her sister and herself beaten to death with clubs. Her death is annually celebrated in Latin America, as a ""violence against women"" theme.Tense, well-acted, enjoyable and horrifying, ""The Times of the Butterflies"" is a minor masterpiece, and an inspirational story, very much worth watching, despite the pan-and-scan format of this DVD.",4,Time for the Dictators,1021075200,"05 11, 2002",2002,1568,"['fine', 'minor', 'movie', 'major', 'themes', 'about', 'resistance', 'dictator', 'woman', 'women', 'liberation', 'real', 'meaning', 'what', 'loss', 'freedom', 'society', 'Directed', 'Mariano', 'Barrroso', 'movie', 'spanning', 'almost', 'three', 'decades', 'life', 'resistance', 'movement', 'leader', 'Minerva', 'Mirabal', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'Dominican', 'Republic', 'various', 'confrontations', 'dictator', 'Rafael', 'Leonidas', 'Trujillo', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'who', 'ruled', 'island', 'nation', 'iron', 'hand', '1930', 'assassination', '1961', 'movie', 'obsession', 'attempts', 'many', 'years', 'make', 'mistress', 'bent', 'revenge', 'when', 'attempts', 'prove', 'futile', 'movie', 'was', 'frequent', 'practice', 'visit', 'country', 'pick', 'young', 'woman', 'filled', 'eye', 'then', 'entice', 'palace', 'dance', 'Many', 'young', 'women', 'were', 'thus', 'impregnated', 'packed', 'Miami', 'other', 'resting', 'place', 'afterwards', 'Minerva', 'courage', 'resist', 'thus', 'paying', 'price', 'father', 'murder', 'imprisonment', 'sisters', 'Miranda', 'leader', 'underground', 'freedom', 'movement', 'code-name', 'butterfly', 'Eventually', 'assassinated', 'thugs', 'sister', 'beaten', 'death', 'clubs', 'death', 'annually', 'celebrated', 'Latin', 'America', 'violence', 'women', 'theme.Tense', 'well-acted', 'enjoyable', 'horrifying', 'Times', 'Butterflies', 'minor', 'masterpiece', 'inspirational', 'story', 'very', 'much', 'worth', 'watching', 'pan-and-scan', 'format', 'DVD']",N/A

Thus, I can only evaluate what I see on the screen.  Salma Hayek fails to bring Minerva Mirabal to life.  We are instead presented with a cardboard character lacking depth and complexity. The same thing essentially holds true for Edward James Olmos&#65533; interpretation of the evil Dominican Republic dictator, Rafael Trujillo.  I am utterly convinced that few superb films can be produced in anything less than three months time.  Sadly, Butterflies comes across as a low budget film that had to be finished within a few weeks.The three Mirabal sisters (nicknamed the butterflies) were leaders in the fight against Trujillo.  They were raised in a solidly middle class during the late 1930s and atypically received an education denied to most women of their era.  Minerva apparently was the very first female to earn a law degree in her male chauvinist and reactionary social milieu.  We observe her growing political interest---and this is where the movie truly fails.  Minerva Mirabal was obviously not a pacifist adherent of Mahatma Ghandi.  Still, we never clearly learn whether she was an outright Communist or a devoted liberal democrat.  Would she have helped her nation gain its independence, or naively doom it to become a totalitarian dictatorship similar to Fidel Castro&#65533;s Cuba?  There is no doubt but that the eventually murdered sisters were courageous idealists.  Nonetheless, were they wise and prudent?  These issues are left hanging and never adequately resolved.  I also wish Butterflies had dealt more fully with the allegations that Trujillo pursued a policy of genocide concerning those with with darker skin.  Was he an admirer of Adolph Hitler&#65533;s pseudoscientific racial purity doctrines?  Such a provocative theme certainly deserved more than a brief remark.I can only give Butterflies three stars and that&#65533;s being very generous.  Hopefully, this story will be retold in the very near future.

This movie is based on the novel of the same name written by Julia Alvarez.  To get a real picture and story of the regime and its impact on the DR people, read the book and pass on the movie which with feels like a Disney movie adaptation.  This movie highlights the role of the Mirabal sisters in opposing Trujillo's brutal rule albeit it really falls short of making you feel the universal fear, pain and suffering of the DR people during the time.  The sisters and their husbands and family members are jailed and tortured in their quest for justice and a better future for their family and their country.  It is hard to imagine (impossible) that Salma Hayek in her fine dresses and attire was a serious revolutionary against a Dictator who slaughtered 30,000 people during his reign.

The storyline is predictable, especially if you know the history of ""El Jefe"" or the story of the sisters and the mariposas(butterflies). Many people here at Amazon have done a good job of describing(beware of spoilers)the movie so I'll skip that part in this review. The story lines adapted from the book are weak, the characters only somewhat believeable but overall it is a shallow depiction of the ruthless regime of Trujillo. The black and white photographas in the beginning lend credibility to the story, are quite graphic, as are the torture scenes but otherwise the movie is luke warm; the action or suspense never heats up. Edward Olmos is good as Trujillo but there is not enough of him. His character seems almost benevolent, the father-like figure of the country who rules with a firm but gentle hand. If we could have seen more of his anger,his suspicion of others, his ruthless and vile conduct it would have been more interesting. Selma Hayek was very good and pretty much dominated the film. I agree with the another reviewer that more attention should have been given to the collective body of work of the sisters. Essentially this is one of those movies you might want to only rent rather than buy. There just isn't enough there to spend your money on.

Chiappelli ""jjcx""","[12, 18]","Whether you have read Julia Alvarez's wonderful novel upon which this movie is based will not affect the level of enjoyment you will have with the movie---it is thoroughly terrible and fails on almost every possible level.First, for people who have read the book, it utterly destroys the framework of the novel.  All of the strength of the Mirabal sisters is devastated by their wimpy portrayals onscreen here; Minerva seems less like a visionary rebel who will lead a nation and more like a clueless teenager who happened to follow the footsteps of a crush.  None of the other sisters get much screen time; in fact, Dede has a total of six lines in the whole movie.  Important plot lines were completely deleted while less-important ones were muddled and made ridiculous (such as Minerva's relationship with Sina).However, for people who haven't read the novel, this movie must surely be twice as bad.  The pacing is horrendous, the music is flat and insipid, the direction is terrible, and the constant fading-in/fading-out (for the commercial breaks that originally came on when this movie aired) is very distracting.  What you have in this movie is a very weak effort by a director to cram 300 pages of material into 85 cheesy minutes.A general rule of thumb when making an adaptation is delete, don't weaken.  If a book has 200 characters, you would cut out 190 of them and focus on 10.  This way, you will have 10 memorable characters and a tight story.  ""In the Time of the Butterflies"" takes the opposite approach---creating 200 really weak characters with a story that folds over itself in a sloppy mess.  Characters come and go like they were passing fads; there's a new character introduced roughly every 2 minutes in the movie.  Since the movie moves at a breakneck speed, you never have a chance to connect with any of the characters.  Even when the acting is at its best, it still doesn't come off as emotionally involving or important because there's just not enough time for you to care about what's happening.I think the best way I can approximate the utter failure of this movie is to describe this analogy: it's like a child with severe ADHD trying to explain ""Schindler's List"" to you within 5 minutes.If you want to really get a good story on the Mirabal sisters, I suggest you either wait until a GOOD director adapts the novel, or just go read Alvarez's work.

I read the book several years ago and found it excellent.  However, this film is rather thin and misses the richness of the story in several ways.The film focuses on just one character, Minerva Mirabel, and that is one of its weaknesses.  There were actually three sisters who were murdered and each one of them has her own complex story that is just hinted at in the film.  Also, there was one sister who survived and her story is important too.  But perhaps the limits of constricting a story into a tight time frame forced this abbreviated version.Salma Hayek is the star and she does do a fine job.  The wicked regime seems awful.  But I just couldn't feel the emotions that were intended by the author.  Of course it's a sad story; it's supposed to be.

Based on Julia Alvarez's strong novel of the same name, this film focuses on the role of the Mirabal sisters, known as &quot;las Mariposas&quot; (the Butterflies), in opposing Trujillo's brutal rule.  As children living comfortably in the country, the Mirabal sisters had been protected from the political dangers of the city.  When three of the four sisters, Minerva (Salma Hayek), Mate (Mia Maestro) and Patria (Lumi Cavazos) decide to go to a convent school in the city, leaving sister Dede (Pilar Padilla) behind, they are exposed for the first time to the realities of Trujillo's rule.Some years later, Minerva, Mate, and Patria, now attractive young women, gain the unwelcome attention of El Jefe at a dance.  When Minerva slaps his face because he fondles her, he retaliates by arresting and torturing her father.  Vowing a personal revenge against him, Minerva eventually joins other students who work to foment rebellion--printing leaflets, distributing guns in the countryside, and speaking to women's groups.  When Mate and Patria eventually join her, the three become known as Las Mariposas, &quot;the Butterflies.&quot;  Jailed and tortured when they are caught by Trujillo's army, they and their husbands hope that by their example they will make life better for their children and for their country.Director Mariano Barroso sacrifices the broad scope and universal themes of the book by concentrating almost exclusively on the personal lives of &quot;las Mariposas,&quot; the risks they took, and the tortures they endured.  This narrow focus removes the Mirabal sisters from their political context and diminishes the sacrifices of thirty thousand other Dominicans who were executed by Trujillo.  Though the four sisters are clearly differentiated in the book and show the important and quite different reasons that people do or do not fight a dictator, here they are virtually indistinguishable from each other, another sacrifice of the broad picture in favor of easier myth-making.Salma Hayek is gorgeous, even under jailhouse conditions, posing so attractively in her closeups that it is difficult to imagine her as a committed revolutionary.  Edward James Olmos, as Trujillo, alternately sneers and smirks but remains mostly an off-screen presence.  Several scenes of sadistic violence stir the emotions, but do not provide the catharsis of real tragedy.  Though it is admirable that Hollywood chose to memorialize &quot;the Butterflies,&quot; it is too bad that the film feels more like a Hollywood production than a memorial to the very real women who made such real sacrifices.

Not much of a difference between her acting in both films.This film is from the Alvaro book, and I have not read it yet, but for those that have not read the book, this film is a great introduction to the horror in the Dominican Republic during that time period. There is some suspense in the film, because you think Salma as the main character dies in the jail since flashbacks are made to it the whole time, but there is a twist.

I ask them to consider, however, that for many viewers outside Latin America this story of the raw courage and self-sacrifice of the Mirabal sisters in opposing the brutal Trujillo dictatorship is virtually unknown.For all the shortcomings mentioned below -- not being filmed in the Dominican Republic, plot of movie thinner than the book, etc. -- the film is an important introduction to a part of the common history of the Western Hemisphere.  It tells a compelling story about events with which even those of us who try to stay abreast of developments in Latin America may nonetheless have been unaware.The portrayals of the two principal characters -- Selma Hayek as Minerva Mirabal and Edward James Olmos as Trujillo -- are of a very high standard indeed.  As other reviewers confirm, the film has inspired many who had previously known little of the Dominican Republic or of the Trujillo regime to delve further into the history and politics of this period, and in particular to learn all they can about the remarkable courage of the Mirabal sisters.Like another neglected masterpiece -- Michael Verhoeven's ""The White Rose"" (""Die Weisse Rose""), which recounts the similarly selfless (almost reckless) courage of Hans and Sophie Scholl in leading a resistance movement against Hitler at the University of Munich in the 1940s -- this film tell a compelling story of resistance against hopeless odds and an almost incomprehensible personal courage.  Despite a few minor weaknesses, ""In the Time of the Butterflies"" is a compelling film that greatly deserves to be seen by a wider audience (and the modest cost of this excellent DVD allows that to happen).My one reservation is that -- particularly since both Selma Hayek and Edward James Olmos are a joy to listen to in the Spanish language -- it is a pity that no Spanish language sound track was included (there are only subtitles in Spanish).  Perhaps MGM will do us the favor of reissuing this important DVD in a dual-language format, with both principal actors speaking their roles in Spanish?  (One would think that the Spanish-speaking market for a film with these two very popular Spanish-speaking actors would be at least as great as the English-speaking one.)In any case, it is clearly a distortion for a film like this, with a compelling theme on a neglected and important episode of recent history and with two fine actors in the principal roles, to be given only one or two stars, when the latest special-effects driven vapidity from the major studios typically receives four or five.

Minerva was willing to let Maria Teresa stay with them but it was during her first night that Palomino entered with a shipment of guns.  In the movie however, Minerva throws Maria Teresa out and Palomino goes after her.  The wedding of Maria Teresa and Palomino was also left out.Also, by the looks of the movie there were only three sisters.  There were FOUR.  Patria, Dede, Minerva, and Maria Teresa.  However the three shown were Patria, Minerva, and Maria Teresa.  What was left out was that Dede was also asked to join the revelution and does so reluctantly.I was also not crazy about the way that the movie was narrated.
