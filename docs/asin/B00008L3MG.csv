744424,A3DM6UGX44NJ9K,B00008L3MG,"Daigo Parry ""Hodor""","[13, 14]","This all important second volume of ""Chobits"" begins to introduce characters, ideas and ongoing clues that begin to give the series a momentum that will carry it to the 26th and final episode.To recap, 18-year-old farm boy Hideki Motosuwa has moved into the big city to attend cram school to get into college. He one day finds Chi, a Persocon (human looking robots that are as popular as cell phones) who may actually be a Chobits, a legendary series of Persocons that, among other powerful and unique abilities, can exercise free will. He must teach her how to go about and survive in the real world, while juggling school, work and the quest to find out her identity.""The Empty City"" is named after a book that catches Chi's eye at the local bookstore. Hideki sacrifices his English lessons by spending his precious, disappearing funds to buy Chi the book instead of a dictionary. She reads the fairy tale and find that the main character seems vaguely to be a Persocon who wanders alone in a city full of human couples, looking for love or companionship. Throughout the series, Chi will continue to find and buy the sequels to the book, which has a surprising author.This volume definitely exemplifies why feminists and younger children might shy away from the series. With Hideki's meager paycheck from the restaurant not quite cutting it, Chi goes out to find a job. She is conned by a stranger into a peep show that is also broadcast online. He encourages her to strip down and do other things; he sticks his hand between her legs and pays the price--a tremendous burst of energy demolishes the peep show house and temporarily disables nearly all the Persocons in the city.Chi continues to learn words, manners and other everyday skills, and gets a safer job at the local bakery, whose owner later plays a significant role in setting up the atmosphere of a world where Persocons are extremely popular, but also somewhat feared for their combined effect on social interaction among humans.""Chobits"" has art on a par with any modern anime, and has some of the cleanest computer graphics integration; the music is superb, with one of the more catchy opening and ending themes. Plenty of booby-type jokes, and certain ideas and themes that may offend those with a strong feminist leaning. Recommended for all others, and those above 13.",5,The Chobits Snowball Gets Rolling,1058659200,"07 20, 2003",2003,2338,"['important', 'second', 'volume', 'Chobits', 'introduce', 'characters', 'ideas', 'ongoing', 'clues', 'begin', 'give', 'series', 'momentum', 'will', 'carry', '26th', 'final', 'episode.To', 'recap', '18-year-old', 'farm', 'boy', 'Hideki', 'Motosuwa', 'moved', 'big', 'city', 'attend', 'cram', 'school', 'get', 'college', 'one', 'day', 'Chi', 'Persocon', 'human', 'looking', 'robots', 'are', 'as', 'popular', 'cell', 'phones', 'who', 'may', 'actually', 'be', 'Chobits', 'legendary', 'series', 'Persocons', 'other', 'powerful', 'unique', 'abilities', 'can', 'exercise', 'free', 'will', 'must', 'teach', 'how', 'go', 'about', 'survive', 'real', 'world', 'juggling', 'school', 'work', 'quest', 'find', 'out', 'identity', 'Empty', 'City', 'named', 'book', 'Chi', 'eye', 'local', 'bookstore', 'Hideki', 'English', 'lessons', 'spending', 'precious', 'disappearing', 'funds', 'buy', 'Chi', 'book', 'instead', 'dictionary', 'fairy', 'tale', 'find', 'main', 'character', 'vaguely', 'be', 'Persocon', 'who', 'alone', 'city', 'full', 'human', 'couples', 'looking', 'love', 'companionship', 'series', 'Chi', 'will', 'continue', 'find', 'buy', 'sequels', 'book', 'surprising', 'author.This', 'volume', 'definitely', 'why', 'feminists', 'younger', 'children', 'might', 'shy', 'away', 'series', 'Hideki', 'meager', 'paycheck', 'restaurant', 'not', 'quite', 'cutting', 'Chi', 'out', 'find', 'job', 'conned', 'stranger', 'peep', 'show', 'also', 'broadcast', 'online', 'strip', 'down', 'do', 'other', 'things', 'hand', 'legs', 'price', 'tremendous', 'burst', 'energy', 'demolishes', 'peep', 'show', 'house', 'temporarily', 'disables', 'nearly', 'Persocons', 'city.Chi', 'learn', 'words', 'manners', 'other', 'everyday', 'skills', 'safer', 'job', 'local', 'bakery', 'owner', 'later', 'significant', 'role', 'setting', 'up', 'atmosphere', 'world', 'where', 'Persocons', 'are', 'extremely', 'popular', 'also', 'somewhat', 'feared', 'combined', 'effect', 'social', 'interaction', 'humans', 'Chobits', 'art', 'par', 'modern', 'anime', 'cleanest', 'computer', 'graphics', 'integration', 'music', 'superb', 'one', 'more', 'catchy', 'opening', 'ending', 'themes', 'Plenty', 'booby-type', 'jokes', 'certain', 'ideas', 'themes', 'may', 'offend', 'strong', 'feminist', 'leaning', 'Recommended', 'others', '13']",Chobits: The Empty City - Volume 2
744425,A3BAHS1EQ8QLCP,B00008L3MG,"GojiraGirl ""musashikojiroai""","[3, 3]","This series is just so darn cute!  The 2nd volume isn't as funny, a little more serious tone, but it does have its share of laughs.Chii has learned a lot of things from Hideki now, and when Hideki buys her her very first book (The Town With No People), she has a very strange reaction to it, which isn't explained yet, but probably in later volumes.  And when Chii suddenly starts acting wierd, like she's sick, Hidkei learns that persocoms need to be charged up!!  There goes the electric bill!!  Then Chii decides to get a job, but when Hideki finds out its at a peepshow he rushes to get her.  But she's gone, leaving a big explosion behind her, and causing other persocoms to freeze!  After he finds her, everything is all right, but what happened to her!?  Then she finds a new job working at a pastry store (in the cutest outfit!!).  I think that we are begining to see that Chii might have feelings for Hideki, after all she does have her own free will, with no programs telling her how to act and feel.  Well, I guess we'll just have to wait and find out!I really enjoy watching this show and I can't wait for the next one!!  The animation is fluid and colorful, and the music really suits the show and situations well.  There's a lot more sensual stuff in this volume though, the peep show scene, and then a dream that Hideki has, so I'd say maybe 16-17 and up, but definetaly not any younger than that.  So, all in all, this is a great volume that I highly recommend!!",5,Very cute!!,1056585600,"06 26, 2003",2003,1478,"['series', 'just', 'so', 'darn', 'cute', '2nd', 'volume', ""n't"", 'funny', 'little', 'more', 'serious', 'tone', 'have', 'share', 'laughs.Chii', 'learned', 'lot', 'things', 'Hideki', 'now', 'when', 'Hideki', 'very', 'first', 'book', 'Town', 'No', 'People', 'very', 'strange', 'reaction', ""n't"", 'explained', 'yet', 'probably', 'later', 'volumes', 'when', 'Chii', 'suddenly', 'acting', 'wierd', 'sick', 'Hidkei', 'persocoms', 'need', 'be', 'charged', 'up', 'electric', 'bill', 'Then', 'Chii', 'get', 'job', 'when', 'Hideki', 'out', 'peepshow', 'get', 'gone', 'leaving', 'big', 'explosion', 'causing', 'other', 'persocoms', 'freeze', 'everything', 'right', 'what', 'happened', 'Then', 'new', 'job', 'working', 'pastry', 'store', 'cutest', 'outfit', 'think', 'are', 'begining', 'see', 'Chii', 'might', 'have', 'feelings', 'Hideki', 'have', 'own', 'free', 'will', 'programs', 'telling', 'how', 'act', 'feel', 'Well', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'wait', 'find', 'out', 'really', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'next', 'one', 'animation', 'fluid', 'colorful', 'music', 'really', 'suits', 'show', 'situations', 'well', 'lot', 'more', 'sensual', 'stuff', 'volume', 'peep', 'show', 'scene', 'then', 'dream', 'Hideki', 'so', ""'d"", 'say', 'maybe', '16-17', 'up', 'not', 'younger', 'So', 'great', 'volume', 'highly', 'recommend']",Chobits: The Empty City - Volume 2

Chii learns about books and money, Hideki learns that Chobits need to be recharged, just like other pieces of equipment, and we learn to always wear goggles at live peepshows.

Schouten ""nephilim1999""","[4, 5]","Okay I must say I was a bit sceptical about this show before it came out considering the hype that surrounded it.But I bought the first DVD and was both moved and laughing out loud since I found it really did live up to the hype.Now there's volume 2 and while there still is lots of humor we also get to see a bit more of the mystery that is Chi. And a mystery it is... Without giving a lot away what becomes apparent here is that Chi is a lot more than your average Persocom. She reacts strangely to some things. Some great power seems to watch over her and she seems to have a predetermined destiny.Plus she seems to have a rather powerful effect on other Persocoms around her which becomes apparent in a great double episode where Chi decides to get a job in order to help Hideki with paying the rent. This offcourse goes all wrong and she gets tricked into working at a peepshow.Things don't turn out how the owner hopes though...This truly is an amazing show.

This set of episodes starts to establish the down-side of innocence.  Nobody really knows anything yet and so far they seem to be worried for the unusual couple.  This disk also starts to shine light of the issue of caring too much about technology.  Some character observations seven show a hint of mockery and taboo over the way Chi and Hideki react to each other.More secrets are revealed and the plot begins to deepen.  The comedic aspect seems to fade in this portion but the story makes it all the much more worth watching.
