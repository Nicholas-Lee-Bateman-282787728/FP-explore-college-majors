802858,AI7AJG2OS4XG,B0001EQIBU,Garm Transit,"[0, 0]",I watched this on tv when it was first on and loved it. So I was thrilled to find it on DVD. It's the real story of the Bradys and the people who played them as told by Barry Williams (Greg). Alot more was going on behind the scenes than most at the time would think. It's a good movie and for Brady fans it's cool to see what it was like for the kids growing up Brady.

802860,AQ01Q3070LT29,B0001EQIBU,James McDonald,"[9, 15]","The beloved Brady Bunch have been with us for 35 years.  It began withThe Brady Bunch - The Complete Series (Seasons 1-5 + Shag Carpet Cover)tv series (1969-73), then they returned as a variety showThe Brady Bunch Variety Hour, a cartoon, and then a new tv-movie, The Brady Girls Get Married (1981).  This followed with a new tv series, The Brady Brides (1981).  In 1988, another reunion tv-movie was made,Very Brady Christmas [VHS]  It was a success.  They returned in a new tv-movie, The Bradys (1990) which was more dramatic.  This spawned another new tv series, ""The Bradys"" (1990). This series was with the Brady kids as grown adults with children of their own dealt with more important issues including ""Marcia"" becoming an alcoholic.Robert Reed was ill with intestinal cancer and had AIDS.  He passed away May 12, 1992.  To pay homage to Robert Reed, the cast returned in 1995 forBrady Home Movies.That same year, someone had the gumption to makeThe Brady Bunch Movie(1995) with a whole new cast.  It was created to spoof the antics of the original Brady Bunch tv series (1969-1973).  Although, some original cast members made cameo appearances, the die hard fans didn't quite take to it.  It didn't stop there.  With another fake cast, they then madeA Very Brady Sequel(1996) andThe Brady Bunch in the White HouseThese two movies were terrible.  But if any good came out of this, it brought back interest of the original ""Brady Bunch"" cast.In February 1993, Barry Williams wrote with Chris Kreski,Growing Up Brady: I Was a Teenage Greg, Special Collector's EditionThis book told us of his memories, juicy tidbits, behind-the-scenes battles and many you-never-knew secrets the way only Barry Williams can tell it about the casts time as ""The Brady Bunch"".  Before his death, Robert Reed wrote a Foreword for the book.In 2000, the bestselling book became a tv-movie, ""Growing Up Brady.  Barry Williams, Mike Lookinland and Sherwood Schwartz makes appearances.  Mike Lookinland's son, Scott, plays ""Bobby"".The original ""Brady Bunch"" cast still pop-up on television once in a while with a new reunion special.  They were last seen together in a reunion special on the TV Land Network in 2004 and on the Travel Channel, ""The Brady Bunch Cast Back in Hawaii (2005).It is always nice to see ""The Brady Bunch"" again whenever they return with Florence Henderson and Ann B.

It starts with the auditions, then the famous wedding/pilot show (""Tiger!!""), and goes through all five seasons with the kids growing up and becoming stars.Barry Williams' memoir inspired this 2000 TV-movie, so it's no surprise that his alter-ego is the heartthrob and star of the show; his amorous longings for screen-sister Maureen McCormick play heavily in the script as does Robert Reed's distaste for the low comedy.Young Barry is played by pre-O.C.Adam Brody who is utterly charming and the only one of the actors who even remotely resembles their famous counterpart.  Williams narrates the story and he and producer Sherwood Schwartz appear briefly.  The movie is all sugar and spice, a sweet and innocent rememberance of a much-loved TV series.

I'm guessing it was a pretty low-budget project and most of it just seems like a half-step above something done by a film school student.  I *love* Barry Williams' book, which has a great narrative and gives some nice blow-by-blow accounts of some tumultuous things that went on behind the camera for five years.  The highlight of Williams' book is the details of the feuding between Sherwood Schwartz and Robert Reed - the film just barely touches on this.  In the lead as Barry, Adam Brody does as well as can be expected.  But there is absolutely zero chemistry between him and the actress who played Maureen McCormick, as opposed to the real-life magnetism between Barry and Maureen that lasted for a while.  Incidentally, the actress who played Maureen was a dog - whereas Maureen (and Christine Taylor, a dead-ringer for her in the BB Movie) was and still is a sizzling hot babe...  A good portion of the film focuses on how the kids got moved into a musical career with their BB stage act, and getting an agent to represent them.  The beginning and ending are extremely corny - with Williams entering the Paramount Studios lot while having conversations with a cabbie and a network exec on the lot about ""if Greg and Marcia ever...did anything"".  If you want the real thing, just read Barry's book instead, it tells the whole story very well - and so vividly that you can almost feel like you were there.
