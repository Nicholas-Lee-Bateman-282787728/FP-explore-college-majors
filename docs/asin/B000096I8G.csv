(See Bob Herbert's 8/16/04 ""Suppress the Vote"" in New York Times... potential FLA voters are being harrassed already).  Still, as the DVD states, Gore asked for a recount in only four counties, not the whole state.  This move gave the GOP a huge selling point:  Gore only wanted Democratic counties recounted; he didn't care about ""every vote being counted.""  Also, the GOP had tough folksy Jim Baker stating their case.  And Gore had... uhhh... Warren Christopher, slight in his eastern pinstripes, and barely audible in too long arguments.  So, if Florida is a case in point of how Gore does politics, he was quite lame.  (That's not even counting Gore retracting his concession).  Were and are the GOP Win At All Costs Machiavellians?  Yes.  Did Gore deserve to win?  Not so sure.  This dvd is one-sided politically, but Moveon.org is putting out some very educational stuff!

752467,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B000096I8G,Anyechka,"[4, 5]","This brief documentary does a really good job at covering how the 2000 election was stolen and how thousands of eligible voters in good standing were turned away from the polls or had their names stricken from the voting rolls entirely.  I find it incredibly frightening that the usual suspects are calling this film ""propaganda"" (since when is the truth propaganda?) and accusing those of us who are wise to what really happened of ""whining.""  How nice to know that some Americans take the democratic process, and the integrity and responsibility that go along with it, so lightly.  The film is far from some hysterical radical leftist propaganda piece; all of the people interviewed are calm, sane, and rational, and back up what they're saying with irrefutable proof.  I guess my idea of a radical leftist differs greatly from that of a neo-con.  It even points out shortcomings of Gore's side, such as saying that it wasn't right to have only demanded a recount of just 4 counties, but should have had a recount of the entire state, as per constitutional law.  The recount wasn't about being bitter ""losers"" or wanting one candidate to win; it was about making sure that every vote counted and that the democratic process wasn't trodden upon.  I was a junior in college during this time, and remember it as a very frustrating depressing time, unable to believe that something like this could happen in a democracy, that the U.S. Supreme Court would put a stop to the recount ordered by Florida's Supreme Court.  Even more frustrating is how a lot of people, whatever side they were on, just don't care.  Apathy is extremely dangerous in a democracy.The subjects covered in the documentary include the outdated voting machines, untrustworthy new computerised voting machines, the various types of paper ballots that led to initial improper vote tallies, how thousands of names were stricken from the voting rolls, how a lot of the names on the lists of ex-felons being denied their constitutional right to vote after having served their time weren't even felons and had never even been arrested, how the civil rights of African-Americans were violated in scary shades of what happened before the Civil Rights Movement, how some of the pro-Bush protestors weren't Floridians but actually staff assistants to various Republican Senators and Congresspeople (one from as far away as Alaska), how these voting irregularities began even before 2000, and how Katherine Harris (the lovely woman who believes that electing non-Christians is tantamount to ""legislating sin""), uncaring there was a serious conflict of interest due to having been on Bush's campaign, used her clout to order the recount stopped.  These sorts of things aren't supposed to happen in a democracy, but sadly they did.Though this is a great documentary and a good introduction to this awful time in recent American history, I wish it had been a bit longer.  There were some subjects that I felt weren't covered in enough depth, or important subjects that weren't really covered at all.  I would have liked, for example, to have seen more on the disenfranchisment of the African-American community and all of the Jewish votes that were mistakenly attributed to Buchanan.  But unfortunately, this is just one of those films that is either dismissed out of hand by those who most need to see it, or continues to be met with angry ranting and propaganda, as though all of the unrefutable facts presented here mean absolutely nothing if they conflict with one's political agenda.",4,The true story behind an appalling miscarriage of justice,1168732800,"01 14, 2007",2007,3543,"['brief', 'documentary', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'covering', 'how', '2000', 'election', 'was', 'stolen', 'how', 'thousands', 'eligible', 'voters', 'good', 'standing', 'were', 'turned', 'away', 'polls', 'had', 'names', 'stricken', 'voting', 'rolls', 'entirely', 'find', 'incredibly', 'frightening', 'usual', 'suspects', 'are', 'calling', 'film', 'propaganda', 'when', 'truth', 'propaganda', 'accusing', 'who', 'are', 'wise', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'whining', 'How', 'nice', 'know', 'Americans', 'take', 'democratic', 'process', 'integrity', 'responsibility', 'go', 'along', 'so', 'lightly', 'film', 'far', 'hysterical', 'radical', 'leftist', 'propaganda', 'piece', 'people', 'interviewed', 'are', 'calm', 'sane', 'rational', 'back', 'up', 'what', ""'re"", 'saying', 'irrefutable', 'proof', 'guess', 'idea', 'radical', 'leftist', 'differs', 'greatly', 'neo-con', 'even', 'out', 'shortcomings', 'Gore', 'side', 'such', 'saying', 'was', ""n't"", 'right', 'have', 'only', 'demanded', 'recount', 'just', '4', 'counties', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'recount', 'entire', 'state', 'constitutional', 'law', 'recount', 'was', ""n't"", 'being', 'bitter', 'losers', 'wanting', 'one', 'candidate', 'win', 'was', 'making', 'sure', 'vote', 'counted', 'democratic', 'process', 'was', ""n't"", 'trodden', 'was', 'junior', 'college', 'time', 'remember', 'very', 'frustrating', 'depressing', 'time', 'unable', 'believe', 'something', 'could', 'happen', 'democracy', 'U.S.', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'would', 'put', 'stop', 'recount', 'ordered', 'Florida', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'Even', 'more', 'frustrating', 'how', 'lot', 'people', 'side', 'were', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Apathy', 'extremely', 'dangerous', 'democracy.The', 'subjects', 'covered', 'documentary', 'include', 'outdated', 'voting', 'machines', 'untrustworthy', 'new', 'computerised', 'voting', 'machines', 'various', 'types', 'paper', 'ballots', 'led', 'initial', 'improper', 'vote', 'tallies', 'how', 'thousands', 'names', 'were', 'stricken', 'voting', 'rolls', 'how', 'lot', 'names', 'lists', 'ex-felons', 'being', 'denied', 'constitutional', 'right', 'vote', 'having', 'served', 'time', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'felons', 'had', 'never', 'even', 'been', 'arrested', 'how', 'civil', 'rights', 'African-Americans', 'were', 'violated', 'scary', 'shades', 'what', 'happened', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Movement', 'how', 'pro-Bush', 'protestors', 'were', ""n't"", 'Floridians', 'actually', 'staff', 'assistants', 'various', 'Republican', 'Senators', 'Congresspeople', 'one', 'far', 'away', 'Alaska', 'how', 'voting', 'irregularities', 'began', 'even', '2000', 'how', 'Katherine', 'Harris', 'lovely', 'woman', 'who', 'electing', 'non-Christians', 'tantamount', 'legislating', 'sin', 'uncaring', 'was', 'serious', 'conflict', 'interest', 'due', 'having', 'been', 'Bush', 'campaign', 'used', 'clout', 'order', 'recount', 'stopped', 'sorts', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'happen', 'democracy', 'sadly', 'did.Though', 'great', 'documentary', 'good', 'introduction', 'awful', 'time', 'recent', 'American', 'history', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'bit', 'longer', 'were', 'subjects', 'felt', 'were', ""n't"", 'covered', 'enough', 'depth', 'important', 'subjects', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'covered', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'example', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'disenfranchisment', 'African-American', 'community', 'Jewish', 'votes', 'were', 'mistakenly', 'attributed', 'Buchanan', 'unfortunately', 'just', 'one', 'films', 'dismissed', 'hand', 'who', 'most', 'need', 'see', 'be', 'met', 'angry', 'ranting', 'propaganda', 'unrefutable', 'facts', 'presented', 'here', 'mean', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'conflict', 'one', 'political', 'agenda']",N/A

752469,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000096I8G,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 10]","As we are mere hours away from the opening of the polls, it is appropriate to take a good, hard look at this concise, fast-paced documentary, which serves as a history lesson on our nation's most controversial election in 2000. No film will motivate you more to vote today, and one would hope that subsequent election reforms would ensure history would not repeat itself. Michael Moore covered this ground on a cursory albeit dramatically effective manner in the memorable beginning of his documentary, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"". Filmmakers Richard Ray P&eacute;rez and Joan Sekler, however, delve much deeper into the morass that changed the course of our leadership.This film is a powerful indictment of the current electoral process, as the disturbing picture that emerges is fraught with suspicious irregularities, electoral injustices, and sinister voter purges in a state governed by Jeb Bush, the winning candidate's brother. We learn Jeb Bush's motivation for misrepresenting the election results corresponds with his extreme unpopularity with blacks in his state. The Republican strategy was intended to suppress the democratic vote since 93% of African Americans are registered Democrats. The documentary also goes into voters improperly removed from the rolls, with a particular emphasis on the ""Felon Purge List"". In one of the more shocking moments, the film reveals that more than 175,000 ballots were uncounted by Florida's voting machines. No complete hand recount was ever conducted. From there, we get into the half-hearted attempts to recount votes in certain counties, which raised all sorts of still open-ended issues. Much of the film follows this process and ends with a look at reforms and concerns for the future, with an emphasis on controversies connected to touchscreen voting. The filmmakers disclose that only a year later, when a consortium of U.S. media organizations published results of an exhaustive examination of these unread ballots, that the conclusion was reached that Al Gore received more votes and would have been our 43rd President. Granted, P&eacute;rez and Sekler have a tendency toward overstatement at times and some of the evidence presented is apocryphal, but the issues raised make this one of the most important films to watch in this or any election year. In fact, considering how close the 2004 race is at this moment, I would consider this essential viewing.",4,Reviving the Nightmare of 2000 in 2004?

752470,A3IPHLD7B59IJ3,B000096I8G,"Enigma ""Cheers""","[2, 2]","The documentary starts off by painting Jeb Bush as a racist for, get this, wanting to do away with archaic  government programs that judged people on the color of your skin. In other words he was embracing Martin Luther King's Jr. ""I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by their character"" and for this he got attacked by racists who want to judge people by their skin color. BTW, did this help Bush with the black vote in Florida - NO in fact it hurt him and caused the NAACP to amount a massive voter drive to get him out of office - what a twisted world we live in, if MLK Jr., a registered Republican, was alive today the NAACP would label him a uncle tom and one of their enemies.Let's move on to the 2000 election.The Felon Purge ListFirst of Greg Palast lied (no shock there) about this. Kathleen Harris was following state law, a law that has been on the books longer than she was alive, and was doing what was mandated by law. She had a list that was given to her by a independent company, this list was then handed out to all of the election commissioners across the state and THEY went through the list and purged off duplicate names, people who were not allowed to legally vote, people who had moved etc. The biggest complaints of wrongly purged names came from three counties, ALL of which had their lists purged by Democratic election commissioners, two of those being black.  Remember that the master list that the film talks about was supposed to be a wide net and it was the election commissioners that needed to match and verify each name on it. Ion Sancho A Democrat and the supervisor of Elections for Leon County in Florida and later lead the voter recounts in Dade County has gone into great detail about this very issue. He said it was his job, as it was other supervisors and election commissioners to double check the list, remove names that shouldn't be there and then turn the list back into Harris. But you would never know this because this film leaves out the pertinent facts in building their false narrative.The claim that the law to protect the validity of the voting process is somehow racially motivated is laughable, since all states have this type of law on the books. The claim that the ""felon purge list"" had a high percentage of blacks on it completely ignores that the percentage it had on it matched the percentage of blacks who were felons, therefore it showed no bias.The film then also lied that Florida Felon Clemency laws are unconstitutional, they are not and never have been. Felons who move to Florida from another state HAVE to fill out a clemency application in order to vote in Florida. If they do not they have NO right to vote. The 2,883 felons that were purged were done so BY law no matter what this film says. BTW other states also have these types of laws too and they have never been ruled unconstitutional.But let's pretend for a second that their narrative they are trying to sell is correct. That thousands of voters were illegally purged and couldn't vote, that should be rather easy to prove right????? Well, the Democratic Party spent millions of dollars using thousands of paid operatives  that canvassed the majority of Florida looking for these looking for these disenfranchised voters.  They went door to door, they advertised on the radio and TV for them, they sent out mailers, etc etc and guess what they found? (drum roll please) They found less than fifteen people that they could verify that tried to vote but were turned away and btw 6 of them (about half) were registered Republicans. The fact is there was NO widespread voting irregularities as this film claims.The OFFICAL recountThe film claims that many counties didn't do a recount but sworn affidavits by multiple witnesses from both political parties in each county says otherwise. The fact is the numbers changed after the mandatory recount but not enough to have Gore win so in the minds of the extreme left obviously there was problem in the recounts because they KNOW their guy won. The funny thing is votes for Gore grew in counties where no republican official oversaw the recount as mandated by law so we must wonder if there was some type of tampering there, especially when the official media recount after the election came much closer to the original tally than the recount.So now we have had two vote counts and both times Bush won the vote but the Gore camp was undeterred, they wanted to win at all cost but they were in a pickle. Florida law allowed a full statewide hand recount but every county would be counted AND the overseas ballots which had NOT been counted yet would also be included in the recount. The Gore camp knew that even if they got all of the over and under votes attributed to them (which was not going to happen) that would not counterbalance the overseas vote that generally favor Republicans by a 7:3 margin. So the democrats took it into their own hands and started illegal recounts in only 4 select counties.  Why only 4 counties you ask - because these 4 counties had the highest percentage of democratic voters in Florida. Gore didn't want every vote counted, he only wanted to make sure that the Democratic Votes got counted.The documentary falsely claimed that the Republicans were against hand-recounts, this is false. George Bush actually signed a very liberal law in Texas about hand recounts. What they wanted was to have the Florida LAW followed and have EVERY county recount not just those that favored Al Gore. The Democrats didn't care and knew the media was on their side so they did their highly questionable recounts which where rightly rejected in favor of the non-partisan counting that took place earlier. The Democrats went to the highly partisan Florida State Supreme courts who ruled that Harrison had to wait to certify the results which went against 100 years of election laws.Next we hear about the overseas ballots that were counted (remember there was still a bunch that were sitting sealed and never got counted). The Democrats wanted to enforce State law on these ballots ignoring federal laws about overseas ballots. Ballots that are mailed by active duty servicemen many times don't get a APO postmark till 2 weeks AFTER they mailed them. We have always allowed this so as to not disenfranchise our military but in this case the Democrats wanted to have all of these votes overturned, luckily federal law prevailed and the ones in the system got counted. What didn't get counted was the ones that arrived after Nov 21st.The republicans appealed the FSSC ruling that changed the election laws AFTER the fact, the video forgot to mention that the United States Supreme Court ruled in a 9-0 vote that the FSSC overstepped it's bounds and could not change laws after the fact. The decision was remanded to the FSSC with a very strong warning to cease partisan tinkering.The ensuing riots in Miami when the Democrats took the ballots hostage and locked them and only Democratic operatives in the room was spun beyond belief. The Republicans were banging on the doors to let them in but the democrats refused and a loud mini-riot ensued. What the documentary forgot to tell you was that locking out the republicans was illegal, no one knows what sort of tampering to the ballots could have happened but if the Democrats wanted a fair and open recount why did they feel the need to lock out the republicans and the press and conduct their recounts in private?Finally the deadline as prescribed by law came and Kathleen Harris certified the vote that George Bush won.This should have been the end but the win-at-any-cost Democrats didn't want to give up so easy so they went back to their friendly FSSC. The highly partisan FSSC was in a bind, they had just been taken to the woodshed by all 9 justices of the USSC for meddling in the election and trying to ensure a Gore victory. But in a brazen snub to the highest court in the land 4 of the 7 FSSC ordered that a new hand recount be done of ALL counties but the recount would exclude the overseas ballots that were sealed.The USSC stepped in again, this time ordering a emergency stay of the FSSC order. But once again the documentary LIED about the actual vote of the USSC claiming it was 5-4 when in reality it was 7-2 but don't believe me, read the actual Court verdict.""Seven Justices of the Court agree that there are constitutional problems with the recount ordered by the Florida Supreme Court that demand a remedy. See post, at 6 (Souter, J., dissenting); post, at 2, 15 (Breyer, J., dissenting). The only disagreement is as to the remedy.""The FSSC illegally ordered a recount AFTER the deadline for requesting one.The FSSC illegally ordered a recount AFTER the vote had been certifiedThe FSSC illegally ordered a recount using NEW and highly ambiguous standards as to how a vote would be counted.The FSSC illegally ignored 75 years of Florida Voting laws in their decisions.The FSSC illegally changed election laws AFTER the votes.The FSSC illegally stopped the counting of certain ballots for no reason.The USSC had no option but to step in and stop the madness that the FSSC was attempting to do. Remember even the dissenting judges did NOT disagree that the FSSC was wrong they all recognized that they only dissented in remedy.Finally the film lies about the media consortium finding but once again don't beleive me read the media's report on their finding""Media Recount: Bush Won the 2000 ElectionIn the first full study of Florida's ballots since the election ended, The Miami Herald and USA Today reported George W.

752479,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B000096I8G,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[17, 22]","First, I thank Amazon.com for having this--and related--DVDs available. They're not otherwise easy to find, and they all contain  FACTS that need to be revealed before election day.I vividly recall on election day 2000 that the networks announced before I went to bed that Gore had won Florida. I went to bed that night realizing that Vice President Gore had been elected. The next morning the newspapers announced an upset. But that was just the beginning.The DVD indicates the efforts the GOP put into maintaining the myth that Bush had won the election. First, Katherine Harris, Florida's Secretary of State--and an avid Bush partisan--and her cronies delayed all the recounts, making them all but impossible.What really got my gander was that there were Republican Congressional staffers--NOT from Florida--who were flown to Florida to demonstrate, raise hell, to discourage the recounts. These are the same conservatives who are spending OUR MONEY to make a sham of the electoral process. And it's pretty hard to question they were there; they're shown demonstrating outside the Florida offices!But the story didn't stop at accusing the GOP. Commentators thoughout make it clear that the Gore operatives should have demanded a statewide recount, not just a few Democratic counties where the count was at least open to question. That, the commentators admit, was a Gore error.Anyway, as we all know, the same Republicans, who when it's convenient proclaim states' rights, went to the US Supreme Court who, on the usual vote of 5 to 4, appointed George W. Bush as president. The four dissenters all wrote their dissenting opinions but, according to the DVD, the most biting was from Justice John Paul Stevens who, in essence, said, the whole democratic process has been ridiculed by the majority decision.The objection I have to the whole ""story"" is that the emphasis seems to be that Gore won--by a little--and that wasn't announced even by the media until months after the election. I think there should have been MORE emphasis on the disenfranchised blacks who were eliminated from the ranks of voters by bogus criminal records. Greg Palast--who is among the commentators in the DVD--in his book ""The Best Democracy Money Can Buy,"" also available from Amazon.com, makes a bigger issue of that, and rightly so. First, that reeks of conspiracy--which I believe this whole sham is, and should be treated as such. Perhaps even more important is that, if those tens of thousands of votes were included, Gore won hands down!This is an excellent DVD, one I plan to use in some pre-election ""salons,"" but do keep in mind that the election wasn't even as close as the DVD makes it seem once the votes of those disenfranched are included in the count.",4,"Slightly ""off-focus""",1096502400,"09 30, 2004",2004,2747,"['First', 'thank', 'Amazon.com', 'having', 'related', 'DVDs', 'available', ""'re"", 'not', 'otherwise', 'easy', 'find', 'contain', 'FACTS', 'need', 'be', 'revealed', 'election', 'day.I', 'vividly', 'recall', 'election', 'day', '2000', 'networks', 'announced', 'went', 'bed', 'Gore', 'had', 'won', 'Florida', 'went', 'bed', 'night', 'realizing', 'Vice', 'President', 'Gore', 'had', 'been', 'elected', 'next', 'morning', 'newspapers', 'announced', 'upset', 'was', 'just', 'beginning.The', 'DVD', 'efforts', 'GOP', 'put', 'maintaining', 'myth', 'Bush', 'had', 'won', 'election', 'First', 'Katherine', 'Harris', 'Florida', 'Secretary', 'State', 'avid', 'Bush', 'partisan', 'cronies', 'delayed', 'recounts', 'making', 'really', 'got', 'gander', 'was', 'were', 'Republican', 'Congressional', 'staffers', 'NOT', 'Florida', 'who', 'were', 'flown', 'Florida', 'demonstrate', 'raise', 'hell', 'discourage', 'recounts', 'are', 'same', 'conservatives', 'who', 'are', 'spending', 'OUR', 'MONEY', 'make', 'sham', 'electoral', 'process', 'pretty', 'hard', 'question', 'were', 'there', ""'re"", 'shown', 'demonstrating', 'Florida', 'offices', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'accusing', 'GOP', 'Commentators', 'make', 'clear', 'Gore', 'operatives', 'should', 'have', 'demanded', 'statewide', 'recount', 'not', 'just', 'few', 'Democratic', 'counties', 'where', 'count', 'was', 'least', 'open', 'question', 'commentators', 'admit', 'was', 'Gore', 'error.Anyway', 'know', 'same', 'Republicans', 'who', 'when', 'convenient', 'proclaim', 'states', 'rights', 'went', 'US', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'who', 'usual', 'vote', '5', '4', 'appointed', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'president', 'four', 'dissenters', 'wrote', 'dissenting', 'opinions', 'according', 'DVD', 'most', 'biting', 'was', 'Justice', 'John', 'Paul', 'Stevens', 'who', 'essence', 'said', 'whole', 'democratic', 'process', 'been', 'ridiculed', 'majority', 'decision.The', 'objection', 'have', 'whole', 'story', 'emphasis', 'be', 'Gore', 'won', 'little', 'was', ""n't"", 'announced', 'even', 'media', 'months', 'election', 'think', 'there', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'MORE', 'emphasis', 'disenfranchised', 'blacks', 'who', 'were', 'eliminated', 'ranks', 'voters', 'bogus', 'criminal', 'records', 'Greg', 'Palast', 'who', 'commentators', 'DVD', 'book', 'Best', 'Democracy', 'Money', 'Can', 'Buy', 'also', 'available', 'Amazon.com', 'bigger', 'issue', 'rightly', 'so', 'First', 'reeks', 'conspiracy', 'believe', 'whole', 'sham', 'should', 'be', 'treated', 'such', 'Perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'important', 'tens', 'thousands', 'votes', 'were', 'included', 'Gore', 'won', 'hands', 'down', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'one', 'plan', 'use', 'pre-election', 'salons', 'do', 'keep', 'mind', 'election', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'as', 'close', 'DVD', 'seem', 'once', 'votes', 'disenfranched', 'are', 'included', 'count']",N/A

752482,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,B000096I8G,William Hare,"[14, 21]","""Unprecedented:  The 2000 Presidential Election"" tells the story behind the shameful clutching of victory from the jaws of defeat by the Bush team over Al Gore through a manipulation of the political process in Florida.  The result was democracy denied and the accession to the presidency of a candidate who lost the popular vote and, but for the application of tactics befitting a totalitarian state, eked out ""victory"" by adding the scandal-tarnished electoral votes of Florida.This film, produced by Robert Greenwald, with comments by Danny Glover and narration by Peter Coyote, has won a host of documentary awards.  It tells the story of the calamitous post-election period in a simple and straightforward way in revealing the manipulation of the democratic process through highjacking the voting process before and after the election.Greg Palast, author of the bestselling work ""The Best Democracy Money Can Buy"" and the current DVD adapted from it, is a featured source in this hard-hitting documentary.  He relates how, after being spurned in his efforts to track down the story of how Jeb Bush, the Republican presidential candidate's brother, as Florida governor, with the assistance of Secretary of State Katherine Harris, was responsible for scrubbing 95,000 voters from the voting roles.  Almost all of the deprived were African Americans, whose voting rights were denied the pretense of preventing felons from voting under Florida law.It was necessary for Palast to obtain cooperation and support from across the Atlantic through the British Broadcasting Corporation to tackle this story after being spurned by the U.S. corporate media.  When he visited Florida's capital city of Tallahassee Palast blew the story wide open.  Palast had learned that a company called Data Base Technologies had been hired to run a check of names of Florida prospective voters to determine if they had previous felony convictions.While DBT provided a long list of names extending across America, company functionaries cautioned Jeb Bush and his subordinates to check more thoroughly since the original list was considered to be preliminary.  This raw list needed refinement by checking out names on the list individually.Palast visited Clay Roberts, Katherine Harris's second in command and Florida's elections commissioner.  In a brief but highly revealing interview, an agitated Roberts, the moment that the BBC reporter mentioned Data Base Technologies and the list it prepared for the state of Florida, jumped up from his chair.  In a trembling, angry tone he terminated the interview.  When Palast rose and attempted to show the DBT list, which was only supposed to serve as a beginning point prior to additional checking, Roberts darted into his office.A still highly agitated Roberts called out to Palast.  As he declared that the reporter must leave immediately a Florida State Trooper summoned by the rattled Roberts to escort Palast from the building flashed Palast a sympathetic smile and declared, ""There's never a dull moment around here.""While citing the mainstream media for its failure to reveal what was really happening in the critical post-election period, the film discloses that the first network to declare George Bush the winner of the election was his first cousin John Ellis, who ran the election desk at Fox News.Another important event covered in ""Unprecedented"" is the riot at Miami's Federal Building, when Republican thugs disrupted the recounting of Dade County presidential ballots.  Certain key figures are identified, office staffers of Republican congressmen who visited Florida to disrupt the recount process.The U.S. Supreme Court majority's action in halting the Florida recount, thereby conferring victory on Bush, is also examined.  The conflicts of interest of Chief Justice Antonin Scalia and Associate Justice Clarence Thomas are disclosed, as well as how they were disregarded for the sake of political expedience.",5,Democracy Denied in Florida,1097798400,"10 15, 2004",2004,3954,"['Unprecedented', '2000', 'Presidential', 'Election', 'story', 'shameful', 'clutching', 'victory', 'jaws', 'defeat', 'Bush', 'team', 'Al', 'Gore', 'manipulation', 'political', 'process', 'Florida', 'result', 'was', 'democracy', 'denied', 'accession', 'presidency', 'candidate', 'who', 'lost', 'popular', 'vote', 'application', 'tactics', 'befitting', 'totalitarian', 'state', 'eked', 'out', 'victory', 'adding', 'scandal-tarnished', 'electoral', 'votes', 'Florida.This', 'film', 'produced', 'Robert', 'Greenwald', 'comments', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'narration', 'Peter', 'Coyote', 'won', 'host', 'documentary', 'awards', 'story', 'calamitous', 'post-election', 'period', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'way', 'revealing', 'manipulation', 'democratic', 'process', 'highjacking', 'voting', 'process', 'election.Greg', 'Palast', 'author', 'bestselling', 'work', 'Best', 'Democracy', 'Money', 'Can', 'Buy', 'current', 'DVD', 'adapted', 'featured', 'source', 'hard-hitting', 'documentary', 'how', 'being', 'spurned', 'efforts', 'track', 'down', 'story', 'how', 'Jeb', 'Bush', 'Republican', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'brother', 'Florida', 'governor', 'assistance', 'Secretary', 'State', 'Katherine', 'Harris', 'was', 'responsible', 'scrubbing', '95,000', 'voters', 'voting', 'roles', 'Almost', 'deprived', 'were', 'African', 'Americans', 'voting', 'rights', 'were', 'denied', 'pretense', 'preventing', 'felons', 'voting', 'Florida', 'law.It', 'was', 'necessary', 'Palast', 'obtain', 'cooperation', 'support', 'Atlantic', 'British', 'Broadcasting', 'Corporation', 'tackle', 'story', 'being', 'spurned', 'U.S.', 'corporate', 'media', 'When', 'visited', 'Florida', 'capital', 'city', 'Tallahassee', 'Palast', 'blew', 'story', 'wide', 'open', 'Palast', 'had', 'learned', 'company', 'called', 'Data', 'Base', 'Technologies', 'had', 'been', 'hired', 'run', 'check', 'names', 'Florida', 'prospective', 'voters', 'determine', 'had', 'previous', 'felony', 'convictions.While', 'DBT', 'provided', 'long', 'list', 'names', 'extending', 'America', 'company', 'functionaries', 'cautioned', 'Jeb', 'Bush', 'subordinates', 'check', 'more', 'thoroughly', 'original', 'list', 'was', 'considered', 'be', 'preliminary', 'raw', 'list', 'needed', 'refinement', 'checking', 'out', 'names', 'list', 'individually.Palast', 'visited', 'Clay', 'Roberts', 'Katherine', 'Harris', 'second', 'command', 'Florida', 'elections', 'commissioner', 'brief', 'highly', 'revealing', 'interview', 'agitated', 'Roberts', 'moment', 'BBC', 'reporter', 'mentioned', 'Data', 'Base', 'Technologies', 'list', 'prepared', 'state', 'Florida', 'jumped', 'up', 'chair', 'trembling', 'angry', 'tone', 'terminated', 'interview', 'When', 'Palast', 'rose', 'attempted', 'show', 'DBT', 'list', 'was', 'only', 'supposed', 'serve', 'beginning', 'point', 'prior', 'additional', 'checking', 'Roberts', 'darted', 'office.A', 'still', 'highly', 'agitated', 'Roberts', 'called', 'out', 'Palast', 'declared', 'reporter', 'must', 'leave', 'immediately', 'Florida', 'State', 'Trooper', 'summoned', 'rattled', 'Roberts', 'escort', 'Palast', 'building', 'flashed', 'Palast', 'sympathetic', 'smile', 'declared', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'here', 'citing', 'mainstream', 'media', 'failure', 'reveal', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'happening', 'critical', 'post-election', 'period', 'film', 'first', 'network', 'declare', 'George', 'Bush', 'winner', 'election', 'was', 'first', 'cousin', 'John', 'Ellis', 'who', 'ran', 'election', 'desk', 'Fox', 'News.Another', 'important', 'event', 'covered', 'Unprecedented', 'riot', 'Miami', 'Federal', 'Building', 'when', 'Republican', 'thugs', 'disrupted', 'recounting', 'Dade', 'County', 'presidential', 'ballots', 'Certain', 'key', 'figures', 'are', 'identified', 'office', 'staffers', 'Republican', 'congressmen', 'who', 'visited', 'Florida', 'disrupt', 'recount', 'process.The', 'U.S.', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'majority', 'action', 'halting', 'Florida', 'recount', 'thereby', 'conferring', 'victory', 'Bush', 'also', 'examined', 'conflicts', 'interest', 'Chief', 'Justice', 'Antonin', 'Scalia', 'Associate', 'Justice', 'Clarence', 'Thomas', 'are', 'disclosed', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'were', 'disregarded', 'sake', 'political', 'expedience']",N/A
