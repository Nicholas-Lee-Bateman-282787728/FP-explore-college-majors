518456,A2UEW04N38LVB,B00003CWPZ,2many2read,"[6, 9]","This is a movie in the Hitchcock style, this time without gore, but with subtle terror.Some of the scenes are homages to the master, but this does not detract from their effectiveness. (I'm thinking of glass of milk carried up the stairs in Suspicion.)The movie is suspenseful, and scary as mild-mannered catering supervisor Hilditch befriends the lost traveller Felicia as she struggles to find her missing boyfriend.  On the surface, Mr. Hilditch seems so nice, but as his little hobby is gradually revealed, even the calmest scenes are quite terrifying.Hilditch has grown up under the suffocating wing of his famous TV chef mother.  Apparently, like the mother-son bonding in Psycho, the results of this ""nurturing"" can be deadly.The leads are played by Bob Hoskins -- what a great actor -- and Elaine Cassidy, a young actress who makes the incredibly naive Felicia come alive.  The movie is from a novel by William Trevor.This is a troubling film, filmed in wide-open industrial spaces that emphasize how alone and weak Felicia is. The only place of comfort is the serial killer's cozy homestead.This is not a Psycho-style shrieker, but it is a work of quiet horror.

518457,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00003CWPZ,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[3, 4]","Felicia's Journey was one of those films that I loved, then hated, then liked, then thought was decent.  It was a difficult film to watch because the pacing that Egoyan has implemented is unlike any other film that I have seen.  His use of the camera to create that uneasy sensation on screen and while watching the film was very impressive.  Hoskins gives the performance of his career as this very controlled man with a very dark secret while Elaine Cassidy impressed me with her simplistic portrayal of Felicia.  This was a brilliant film, but there were just some scenes and elements that didn't seem to match the rest of the film.  The ending in particular was a bit misleading and at times rushed, but everything building up to that point really hit a strong nerve.  If you were to define the word ""thriller"", I don't think that you could do it without mentioning this film.  Brilliant acting, an interesting use of direction (which worked very well), and a story that allowed itself to be build upon during each scene are just a few of the great moments (that overshadow the poor) in this movie.Felicia's Journey would not have been the powerhouse that it was if it was not for the powerful acting by Bob Hoskins who completely engulfed this character and showed us this rare glimpse of evil humanity.  While I am sure that some of it is due in part by Egoyan's direction, but you cannot keep your eyes off Hoskins whenever he is on the screen.  He builds his character so well, and bit by bit, that you never can anticipate what will he will say or do next.  That is what is brilliant about Hoskins.  Normally, when you have a troubled soul like Hilditch you can sometimes guess what he is going to do next.  Actors sometimes fall into a pattern of repetition, but with Hoskins it was as if we were watching the final chapter and there were bigger events taking place.  He also worked so well with Cassidy that at times I had forgotten that I was watching a film.  His ability to be this sinister father figure to this girl was impressive.  Hoskins really built this beautiful family dynamic to the film that I never saw coming.  Outstanding performances by both that any film connoisseurs should not miss.Taped onto the vintage acting is this deeply engrossing story that pours from the bottle like some freshly corked wine.  The simplicity of the story allows the complexity of the characters emerge and be triumphant.  The story gives our characters layers upon which we gradually peel away.  Hoskins character especially.  From the opening scene until the final, I felt as if I was given the whole course, and not just bits and pieces.  While Felicia's name does take the title of this film, it is Hoskins whom this story is really about.  We learn more about his life, and his struggles than we do with Felicia.  Yet, the story does not stop there.  I found it quite interesting that Felicia father caused her conflict, while a matriarchal figure challenged Hilditch's perception.  I thought that Egoyan was really trying to do more than tell a serial killer story (as the box may reveal) by giving us these strange and strangled family moments.  I felt as if this was more a story about family, then it was about the horrors of humanity ... or perhaps it was a slice of both.  Either way, the story is the foundation to this picture, and for the first time it really worked.  So many times we go to the theater expecting to be blown away by a creative and empowering story, but this time it was a polar opposite.  The acting is what kept this film high above water, while the story (as simple as it was) only helped build Hoskins and Cassidy further into the world of impressiveness.Finally, there was Egoyan behind the camera doing what he does best.  I have seen only one of his other films, Exotica, and he is notorious for building the suspense from behind the camera as well as in front.  His choice of panning in the wrong direction, the colors surrounding our characters and the sound of the film hit our nerves before any actors even walk into the picture.  This is all coming from Egoyan's mind, which continues to impress me with each film that I view.  I cannot wait to see more of his work and to see how well he has developed with each project.  You can definitely see the Hitchcock influence that has been imprinted with Egoyan.  I finished watching Frenzy (by Hitchcock) right after this film and the similarities were uncanny.  Egoyan reminds me of a cross between Hitchcock and von Trier.  His bold style makes each film his own, yet he is not afraid to be brutally honest and attributive to the cultural setting.  He is a true filmmaker that needs to continue to prove that you don't need millions to create a masterpiece.While I have given credit to everyone, and thing, that deserves it in this film, I must finish this review by saying that this film was not perfection on a stick, but very close.  There were some unfinished ends that could have been tied better, and the ending just felt as if there was this outside influence at work that Egoyan was battling.  Up until the final twenty minutes of this film, I was thoroughly enjoying what I was seeing, but when the idea of religion was brought in from left field, I felt the final moments were rushed and forced.  I needed something just as dramatic, just not so random.  Also, I needed some form of conclusion to Felicia's actual ""journey"".  Did she find what she was looking for?Overall, I was very impressed with this film.Grade: **** out of *****",4,Purity itself can surely wash the pain away.,1110931200,"03 16,

518458,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CWPZ,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Atom Egoyan apparently can't make a normal film, which is something I really admire about him.  His take on the serial killer story is far from what one would expect, and maybe that is just what we should expect from Atom.  Instead of thrusting violence in our faces and telling us what is going on right off the bat, Atom allows his characters to simmer in a pot of tension until everything becomes clear to the audience.`Felicia's Journey' introduces us to two lost souls.  Felicia is pregnant with her absent boyfriend's baby.  She's confused as to where he is, because she's received conflicting stories and no one seems to be of any help getting her in contact with him, so she travels from Ireland to England in search of him.  Along the way, she meets Joe.  Joe is a lonely older gentleman who manages a catering company and is obsessed with his late mother's television cooking show.  He takes an interest in Felicia and offers his assistance.  Her naivety and desperation are an easy target for this seemingly kind hearted man who is hiding a dark secret; one that involves a slew of dead young women.Bob Hoskins really makes this film work; because he personifies `chilling' in a way that I don't think I've seen before.  He nails his character's inner demons to the point where he embodies this man.  His quiet demeanor and his soft spoken directness are both delicate details to underscoring this man's madness.  Arsinee Khanjian is also astonishingly haunting as Gala, Joe's eccentric mother.Egoyan directs his film with a sharp sense of internalized dread.  By splicing two storylines (that of Joe's progressive madness and Felicia's journey) he builds two stories of equal depth and then peppers them with enough atmosphere to keep us glued.  The score in particular is expertly used to instill the needed reaction from the audience, and the stunning cinematography is equal parts crisp and beautiful as well as intimate and chilling.  No, this is not your average serial killer film and no, it won't necessarily make you jump out of your seat, but Bob Hoskins will crawl under your skin and the ambiguous implications that surround both storylines will provoke you to contemplate the real meaning of this film long after the film wraps.",5,A journey to the depths of madness...,1345766400,"08 24, 2012",2012,2252,"['Atom', 'Egoyan', 'apparently', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'normal', 'film', 'something', 'really', 'admire', 'take', 'serial', 'killer', 'story', 'far', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'maybe', 'just', 'what', 'should', 'expect', 'Atom', 'Instead', 'thrusting', 'violence', 'telling', 'what', 'going', 'right', 'bat', 'Atom', 'characters', 'simmer', 'pot', 'tension', 'everything', 'becomes', 'clear', 'audience.', 'Felicia', 'Journey', 'introduces', 'two', 'lost', 'souls', 'Felicia', 'pregnant', 'absent', 'boyfriend', 'baby', 'confused', 'where', 'received', 'conflicting', 'stories', 'one', 'be', 'help', 'getting', 'contact', 'Ireland', 'England', 'search', 'way', 'Joe', 'Joe', 'lonely', 'older', 'gentleman', 'who', 'catering', 'company', 'obsessed', 'late', 'mother', 'television', 'cooking', 'show', 'interest', 'Felicia', 'assistance', 'naivety', 'desperation', 'are', 'easy', 'target', 'seemingly', 'kind', 'hearted', 'man', 'who', 'hiding', 'dark', 'secret', 'one', 'slew', 'dead', 'young', 'women.Bob', 'Hoskins', 'really', 'film', 'work', 'chilling', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before', 'character', 'inner', 'demons', 'point', 'where', 'man', 'quiet', 'demeanor', 'soft', 'spoken', 'directness', 'are', 'delicate', 'details', 'underscoring', 'man', 'madness', 'Arsinee', 'Khanjian', 'also', 'astonishingly', 'haunting', 'Gala', 'Joe', 'eccentric', 'mother.Egoyan', 'film', 'sharp', 'sense', 'internalized', 'dread', 'splicing', 'two', 'storylines', 'Joe', 'progressive', 'madness', 'Felicia', 'journey', 'two', 'stories', 'equal', 'depth', 'then', 'peppers', 'enough', 'atmosphere', 'keep', 'glued', 'score', 'particular', 'expertly', 'used', 'instill', 'needed', 'reaction', 'audience', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'equal', 'parts', 'crisp', 'beautiful', 'as', 'well', 'intimate', 'chilling', 'No', 'not', 'average', 'serial', 'killer', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'make', 'jump', 'seat', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'will', 'crawl', 'skin', 'ambiguous', 'implications', 'surround', 'storylines', 'will', 'provoke', 'contemplate', 'real', 'meaning', 'film', 'long', 'film', 'wraps']",N/A

518463,A1NPNGWBVD9AK3,B00003CWPZ,"Bruce Kendall ""BEK""","[9, 14]","This film is, I must admit, my introduction to Egoyan's works. He is a director who comes highly recommended by a friend whose taste in films I admire.There is, indeed, much to admire about Felicia's Journey. The cinematography is excellent, with many memorable frames. One that particularly sticks in my mind is a shot of a nuclear power plant, brilliantly photographed, that captures the emptiness of the landscape, as well as being a harbinger and symbol of the roiling emotions that lay beneath the surface of the main character's (Hilditch's)calm exterior. There are many such nuances in the film. Egoyan is clearly a director with a sure hand.We know from the outset of the film that there is something not quite right about Hilditch (Bob Hoskins). What makes the character interesting and keeps us in suspense for a time, is that the character can go either way. Early on, it looks as if he may just be a mild mannered eccentric who has a compulsion about the proper preperation of food. We see him comically standing at the prep table in his elaborate home kitchen, carefully mimicing the step by step instructions of a rather ditzy French Lady Chef on a small screen TV.The same is true of Felicia (Elaine Cassidy), who arrives at the customs desk in England, having come over by ferry from N Ireland. She is the ultimate rube, not even realizing that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, when the customs officer explains that that is why she doesn't need a passport. We are set up to expect very little out of naive, lost-girl Felicia.The first indicator that something is not right with Hilditch is conveyed very subtly. Directly after the characters first meet and Hilditch has directed Felicia to a factory where she might possibly locate her boyfriend (the object of her visit), the camera shows Hilditch stopping his car and checking Felicia out in his rear view mirror for a fleeting moment. We know from that moment that there are ominous things on the horizon. We just don't know how onminous or how severe. As the plot and the characters develop, we gradually come to learn the sordid truth.Excellent preformances from the leads and several supporting characters (particularly from Egoyan's wife, Arsin&eacute;e Khanjian). The Lost Girl scenes (as viewed from a secret video camera planted on the dashboard of Hilditch's car) were fairly effective in the final edit. Yet the extended scenes in the DVD extras showed just how painfully amateurish these young actresses actually were. First year drama class material. The East Indies Bible lady was also playing to stereotype and her expressions consisted more of mugging than acting.In the final analysis, the film was satisfying enough to make me want to seek out more Egoyan films.

It's not in the same league as Hereafter, but it is an excellent, disturbing movie.Bob Hoskins plays Joseph Hilditch, who runs a big kitchen operation to feed the employees of a factory. At night he cooks elaborate dinners in his own gadget-filled kitchen while watching old video tapes of a cooking show. The star of the show had been his mother, an enveloping presence who completely dominated young Joey. Then he eats his meals alone, listening to Mantovani and other standbys of the Fifties. He also occasionally helps out young women when they are in distress.Felicia (Elaine Cassidy) has come to his city from Ireland to look for her lover, who left to find a better job and promised to write regularly. He never wrote and she found herself pregnant.They meet. He takes her in. Through flashbacks and circumstance we learn that Hilditch is a disturbed and violent individual. The movie sets all this up in an uneasy, quiet, almost sympathetic way, and then deals with how these two deal with each other.This isn't some sort of murder or horror story; Hoskins doesn't jump out of closets. It's about two damaged people in which more damage can happen.

The cast is superb -- Elaine Cassidy is perfect as Felicia, and a better choice than Bob Hoskins as Mr. Hilditch I can't imagine.

Without writing a 'spoiler' review, I'll just mention that the entire 'videotape' take on Hilditch's 'memory lane', as well as the cooking videos he watches are products of Egoyan's imagination -- they were not present in the novel, and it certainly didn't lack for their non-existence.

518471,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00003CWPZ,Lawyeraau,"[2, 4]","This film adaptation of William Trevor's novel of psychological suspense, for which its author  was the recipient of the 1994 Whitbread Award, is one that those who read the book should see, as well as those who like unusual films of psychological suspense. After reading the book, I became curious as to how a film adaptation would work, as so much of the book involves the introspections of two people whose lives interconnect. Despite some of its shortcomings, it is definitely a film worth seeing, if only for Bob Hoskins brilliant performance.Felicia is a seventeen year old motherless and naive Irish girl, who has become intimate with an Irish boy named Johnny. Of course, the expected ensues, and after Johnny has left Ireland and returned to England where he ostensibly works, Felicia is left holding the bag. Her disapproving father suspects Johnny of actually being in the British Army and, thus, a traitor to his own. He also has a few choice words for his daughter, now that she is in the family way, and none of it is flattering. So, Felicia leaves her rural village and her family and goes off in search of Johnny, having nothing more than the vaguest of ideas where he might be.She crosses the Irish Sea and arrives in the English Midlands in the industrial city of Birmingham, as she believes Johnny to be working in a lawn mower factory there. In her search for Johnny, she runs into the portly catering manager for one of the local factories. His name is  Joseph Ambrose Hilditch, and he is outwardly a jovial and agreeable man, well-liked by his co-workers and meticulous about his culinary repasts. He lives in solitary splendor in  the large house in which he grew up. There, he concocts lavish gourmet meals, while watching tapes of his deceased mother's television show, as she was a chef of some renown. Obviously, he was quite close to his mother, and he still misses her. The house is cluttered with collectibles but is well-kept, although decorated in the style of a bygone era. Mr. Hilditch is, indeed, a collector, but his collection is initially far beyond Felicia's imaginings.  In fact, Mr. Hilditch has a darker side to him, which is not immediately discernible by the unwary.When Felicia first meets Mr. Hilditch, it is to ask for information in connection with her fool's errand, but something about her catches Mr. Hilditch's fancy, and he finds himself keeping Felicia in his crosshairs. When Felicia seemingly unexpectedly runs into Mr. Hilditch again, he directs her to lodgings, and so it begins. As Mr. Hilditch insinuates himself ever so slowly into her life, weaving a fantasy about his own life that is sure to put her mind at ease about him. Felicia begins finding herself ensnared  by this ostensibly kind and ever so helpful, avuncular man, and she initially fails to see the darkness that lies at the core of his being. The viewer, however, is given sneak peaks into some of his peculiarities and deceits.Bob Hoskins is magnificent in the role of Mr. Hilditch, infusing the character with an avuncular charm that sits as a thin veneer over the cauldron of seething emotion within, emotions that cause Mr. Hilditch to act in ways most others would not. The viewer sees what Felicia fails to see, until it is almost too late, the duplicity and cunning that is masked by his overt geniality and seeming kindness. Like a spider to the fly, our teddy bearish Mr. Hilditch begins laying his trap, and so Felicia's journey thrusts her into the belly of the beast. Newcomer, Eileen Cassidy is quite good as Felicia, playing her with a naivet&eacute; that is central to the character. Unlike the  character of Mr. Hilditch, who physically stays true to the Mr. Hilditch of the book, the Felicia of the film differs physically. Instead of a pail, puling, nun like blonde, the viewer is presented with a robust looking, fresh-faced brunette.The cinematography is excellent, and the interior of Mr. Hilditch's home is magnificent, as it evokes another era, miring Mr. Hilditch in happier times while at home. The musical soundtrack is used to good effect to maintain that evocation. The director, Atom Egoyan, who also wrote the screenplay, does a fairly good job of adapting the book to the screen, given some of the constraints inherent in the book. Where the film fails somewhat is in the exploration of the darker corners of the human psyche, although he maintains the cat and mouse game that is central to the story. While the mind of Mr. Hilditch is dark, indeed,  unlike the book, there are no unspeakable revelations in the film as to what lies at the heart of his predilection. What the director substitutes does not really satisfy the viewer as to why Mr. Hilditch does what he does.The film, however,  manages to show how each of these two flawed human beings were initially able to achieve a connection with another, only to find ostensible betrayal. What is decidedly different is the way that they each cope with that betrayal. Moreover, the book has no happily-ever-after ending to its story, which culminates with a conclusion that is quite bleak, robbing the reader of some satisfaction. The film's conclusion differs from that of the book, and while  less bleak, is also somewhat unsatisfactory but, perhaps, only so to those who may have already read the book.  As in the book, the journey that Felicia makes is larger in scope than merely a trip across the Irish Sea.",4,A JOURNEY TO REMEMBER...,1123718400,"08 11, 2005",2005,5424,"['film', 'adaptation',

Base on the novel by William Trevor, Egoyan's adaptation is a dreary, very slow paced, and haunting tale of a young pregnant girl searching for her missing boyfriend, and unwittingly getting involved with a serial killer. The story is told with no blood or gore, but manages to be unsettling because of the solid performances by the entire cast. Bob Hoskins' Hilditch is in many ways like Norman Bates in PSYCHO, an innocent driven so crazy by an unstable mother (an eerie Arshinee Khanjian, Egoyan's wife) that he has grown up with a need to kill. This is the most fascinating aspect of the story and I would have liked it seen explored some more. Felicia's Journey is definitely not for all tastes. Its pacing is deliberately slow and might not work for some, but it is a good film, if not a great one, full of Egoyan's trademark style.

518474,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CWPZ,Matthew Horner,"[2, 5]","""Felicia's Journey"" is an intriguing psychological thriller about a pregnant young Irish girl who goes to England looking for the father of her baby and finds instead a psychotic, middle-aged man disguised as savior. The brilliant Canadian director, Atom Egoyan, literally isn't quite at home with the material or the location [it was shot in Great Britain]. Consequently, the movie is not quite as good as my two favorites of his, ""The Sweet Hereafter"" and ""Exotica"", though it shares that same fascinating, hypnotic quality I so much admire.As Joe, a man whose facade conceals some dreadful secrets, Bob Hoskins is awesome. He seems so innocent and well-meaning until you notice how quickly the look in his eyes can go from benign to malignant. Elaine Cassidy is just about perfect as Felicia, the young girl. She gives her dignity and purpose, portraying her as a good girl who doesn't have a clue as to how to deal with her problems. She lets Joe lure her in, not because she is stupid, but because she is innocent and unworldly.This is not a commercial movie. One of the main reasons is that Joe is not an over-the-top villain. He is all too similar to lots of people we see every day. He does appear to be a bit furtive and secretive at times, but not so much so that anyone would suspect his dreadful other side. He is not over there in some special place we pretend madmen live in. He's just the nice man who lives next door. We can't distance ourselves from him easily, and that's an uncomfortable feeling. We are much more at home with the likes of Hannibal Lecter, who safely exists only in a book or a movie.Despite its faults, ""Felicia's Journey is much better than the average thriller, in particular because its images stick with you long after you've seen it.Since I have not read the novel the movie is based on, I can't comment on how the two compare.",4,Intriguing thriller is lesser Egoyan,1019433600,"04 22, 2002",2002,1869,"['Felicia', 'Journey', 'intriguing', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'pregnant', 'young', 'Irish', 'girl', 'who', 'England', 'looking', 'father', 'baby', 'instead', 'psychotic', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'disguised', 'savior', 'brilliant', 'Canadian', 'director', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'literally', ""n't"", 'quite', 'home', 'material', 'location', '[', 'was', 'shot', 'Great', 'Britain', ']', 'Consequently', 'movie', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'two', 'favorites', 'Sweet', 'Hereafter', 'Exotica', 'shares', 'same', 'fascinating', 'hypnotic', 'quality', 'so', 'much', 'admire.As', 'Joe', 'man', 'facade', 'dreadful', 'secrets', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'awesome', 'so', 'innocent', 'well-meaning', 'notice', 'how', 'quickly', 'look', 'eyes', 'can', 'go', 'benign', 'malignant', 'Elaine', 'Cassidy', 'just', 'about', 'perfect', 'Felicia', 'young', 'girl', 'dignity', 'purpose', 'portraying', 'good', 'girl', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'how', 'deal', 'problems', 'Joe', 'lure', 'not', 'stupid', 'innocent', 'unworldly.This', 'not', 'commercial', 'movie', 'One', 'main', 'reasons', 'Joe', 'not', 'over-the-top', 'villain', 'too', 'similar', 'lots', 'people', 'see', 'day', 'appear', 'be', 'bit', 'furtive', 'secretive', 'times', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'anyone', 'would', 'suspect', 'dreadful', 'other', 'side', 'not', 'special', 'place', 'pretend', 'madmen', 'live', 'just', 'nice', 'man', 'who', 'next', 'door', 'ca', ""n't"", 'distance', 'easily', 'uncomfortable', 'feeling', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'home', 'likes', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'who', 'safely', 'only', 'book', 'movie.Despite', 'faults', 'Felicia', 'Journey', 'much', 'better', 'average', 'thriller', 'particular', 'images', 'stick', 'long', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'it.Since', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'novel', 'movie', 'based', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'how', 'two', 'compare']",N/A

Perhaps, but only after both characters have been sat down upon a couch and had their brains analyzed by a shrink. Mr. Hilditch: A lonely, pathetic, deranged older man, forever trapped in the mind of a pre-pubescent boy still under the spell of an oblivious mother completely pre-occupied with a French cooking show she hosts. Felicia: A ""deer in the headlights"" Irish girl, disowned by her father after getting herself knocked up by Johnny, a British lad who after having slept with her, takes the first bus out of Ireland. Even though Felicia's off to visit the elusive Johnny instead of Grandma, the big bad wolf could care less. As soon as he spots her his taste buds start performing a ritual dance and our little miss mistakes him for a puppy dog. Fortunately, it's not so much the story as the storytelling that makes FELICIA'S JOURNEY so mesmerizing, and both director Egoyan and  writer William Trevor are excellent storytellers that have the uncanny ability at finding the macabre in the mundane. Egoyan also has an incredible talent for taking a popular tune and putting into a specific context thus allowing it to work in unison with the images to tell the story with much greater depth. In making this film so effective, Egoyan owes much to the performance of Bob Hoskins who manages to take a character so despicably horrific and infuse him with such a tremendous sense of loneliness and isolation, that we actually feel sorry for him.",4,The big bad wolf and little red riding hood?,1106784000,"01 27, 2005",2005,1494,"['big', 'bad', 'wolf', 'little', 'red', 'riding', 'hood', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'sat', 'down', 'couch', 'had', 'brains', 'analyzed', 'shrink', 'Mr.', 'Hilditch', 'lonely', 'pathetic', 'deranged', 'older', 'man', 'forever', 'trapped', 'mind', 'pre-pubescent', 'boy', 'still', 'spell', 'oblivious', 'mother', 'completely', 'pre-occupied', 'French', 'cooking', 'show', 'hosts', 'Felicia', 'deer', 'headlights', 'Irish', 'girl', 'disowned', 'father', 'getting', 'knocked', 'up', 'Johnny', 'British', 'lad', 'who', 'having', 'slept', 'first', 'bus', 'Ireland', 'Even', 'Felicia', 'off', 'visit', 'elusive', 'Johnny', 'instead', 'Grandma', 'big', 'bad', 'wolf', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'As', 'soon', 'taste', 'buds', 'start', 'performing', 'ritual', 'dance', 'little', 'miss', 'mistakes', 'puppy', 'dog', 'Fortunately', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'storytelling', 'FELICIA', 'JOURNEY', 'mesmerizing', 'director', 'Egoyan', 'writer', 'William', 'Trevor', 'are', 'excellent', 'storytellers', 'have', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'finding', 'macabre', 'mundane', 'Egoyan', 'also', 'incredible', 'talent', 'taking', 'popular', 'tune', 'putting', 'specific', 'context', 'thus', 'allowing', 'work', 'unison', 'images', 'tell', 'story', 'much', 'greater', 'depth', 'making', 'film', 'so', 'effective', 'Egoyan', 'owes', 'much', 'performance', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'who', 'take', 'character', 'so', 'despicably', 'horrific', 'infuse', 'tremendous', 'sense', 'loneliness', 'isolation', 'actually', 'feel', 'sorry']",N/A

The man who interacted so well with animated characters in &quot;Roger Rabbit&quot; scores again as a brooding, lonely single man  whose character was mis-shaped by a domineering, non-maternal t.v.  personality mother.Under Atom Egoyan's superb direction, the complexity  of the characters and their situations unfolds so slowly and subtly that  the collision course they are on is not immediately obvious.  One wonders  why Hilditch/Hoskins is so obsessed with the t.v. French chef, Gala, to the  point of owning films of all her shows and a good many food processors she  endorses, until one realizes that the chubby boy in the black and white  films is Hilditch as a frustrated child.  The child abuse caught on camera  makes one wonder what childhood was like in the spacious, empty house that  Hilditch has always called home.It is almost possible sympathize with  Hilditch's sad attempts to bond with various females, all clearly too young  and too street-hardened to be good partners for him, until it becomes  obvious what their fates have been and what fate awaits the tragic figure  of Felicia--whose pregnancy causes her to be rejected by the child's  father, his mother, and her own father.  It is a very interesting twist  that the unwanted pregnancy is ultimately what buys Felicia the required  time to save her life.I would give this movie five stars but for what I  perceive as a couple of minor flaws.  Sometimes I thought Hoskins had a bit  of a problem maintaining his English accent.  Also, I am not altogether  convinced that releasing his last would-be victim and committing suicide  was a totally believeable reaction by Hilditch to his encounter with the  born-again oddballs who came knocking on his garden gate, even if they did  seem to pose some threat that his homocidal proclivities might soon be  revealed.  But then, it could be argued that a man who spent so much time  insulating himself with walls (the garden wall, his house, the building in  which he worked, and his car) might just feel he had nowhere to go but out  when it appeared that those walls had been invaded.Viewing  &quot;Felicia's Journey&quot; is a most worthwhile experience.

The least Atom could have done for the audience was make  Felicia's Journey &quot;R&quot; but instead he went with a happy PG-13  rating that DOES NOT cut it with this subject matter.,1,Not That Great Of A Journey,959644800,"05 30, 2000",2000,725,"['film', 'most', 'pathetic', 'serial', 'killer', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Why', 'suspernse', 'what', 'so', 'ever', 'would', 'think', 'film', 'serial', 'would', 'be', 'anything', 'boring', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'peice', 'garbage', 'everything', 'exeptional', 'only', 'thing', 'mean', 'only', 'thing', 'film', 'was', 'even', 'worthy', 'was', 'Bob', 'Hoskin', 'preformance.I', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'seeing', 'film', 'ever', 'again', 'hope', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'learned', 'very', 'important', 'lesson', 'making', 'so-called', 'thillers', 'one', 'was', 'so', 'dull', 'least', 'Atom', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'audience', 'was', 'make', 'Felicia', 'Journey', 'quot', 'R', 'quot', 'instead', 'went', 'happy', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'NOT', 'cut', 'subject', 'matter']",N/A

It was the first film where I could understand a word he was saying. I simply couldn't penetrate his cockney in The Long  Good Friday or Mona Lisa.That doesn't mean I couldn't understand his  characters. Hoskins is a forthright screen actor. He can inhabit his  compact frame with a ferocious mob boss, a compassionate chauffer, a duct  repairman or a foil for Roger Rabbit with imperceptible  effort.Felicia's Journey played the Cannes film festival, there was a  buzz about his performance. I liked the idea of him teaming with Atom  Egoyan whose tragic The Sweet Hereafter drew a heartwrenching performance  from Ian Holm.Listening to William Trevor's book on tape, I could  tell the role of factory caterer/serial killer Joseph Ambrose Hilditch was  made for Hoskins.Mr Hilditch's hands are small, seeming not to belong  to the rest of him; deft, delicate fingers that can insert a battery into a  watch or tidily truss a chicken, this latter a useful accomplishment, for  of all things in the world Mr Hilditch enjoys eating.Like his  predecessors Anthony Perkins (Psycho) and Barry Foster (Frenzy) he seems  outwardly affable enough when he's with his coworkers or offering avuncular  advice to wayward girls like Felicia (Elaine Cassidy). Atom Egoyan  dispenses with the sensationalism of Hitchcock's shower scene and staircase  sequences. He credits us with the wherewithal to conjure our own violent  images to accompany Hilditch's collection of videotaped victims.On  the other hand, he doesn't rely on a convoluted psychiatrist's explanation  to explain to us where Hilditch went wrong. We simply watch him go wrong  this time.",4,Atom Egoyan's Psycho,959126400,"05 24, 2000",2000,1734,"['a-movie-to-see.com', 'recommendationBrazil', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'film', 'saw', 'third', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'where', 'could', 'understand', 'word', 'was', 'saying', 'simply', 'could', ""n't"", 'penetrate', 'cockney', 'Long', 'Good', 'Friday', 'Mona', 'Lisa.That', ""n't"", 'mean', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'characters', 'Hoskins', 'forthright', 'screen', 'actor', 'can', 'inhabit', 'compact', 'frame', 'ferocious', 'mob', 'boss', 'compassionate', 'chauffer', 'duct', 'repairman', 'foil', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'imperceptible', 'effort.Felicia', 'Journey', 'played', 'Cannes', 'film', 'festival', 'was', 'buzz', 'performance', 'liked', 'idea', 'teaming', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'Sweet', 'Hereafter', 'drew', 'heartwrenching', 'performance', 'Ian', 'Holm.Listening', 'William', 'Trevor', 'book', 'tape', 'could', 'tell', 'role', 'factory', 'caterer/serial', 'killer', 'Joseph', 'Ambrose', 'Hilditch', 'was', 'made', 'Hoskins.Mr', 'Hilditch', 'hands', 'are', 'small', 'seeming', 'not', 'belong', 'rest', 'deft', 'delicate', 'fingers', 'can', 'insert', 'battery', 'watch', 'tidily', 'truss', 'chicken', 'useful', 'accomplishment', 'things', 'world', 'Mr', 'Hilditch', 'predecessors', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'Psycho', 'Barry', 'Foster', 'Frenzy', 'outwardly', 'affable', 'enough', 'when', 'coworkers', 'offering', 'avuncular', 'advice', 'wayward', 'girls', 'Felicia', 'Elaine', 'Cassidy', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'sensationalism', 'Hitchcock', 'shower', 'scene', 'staircase', 'sequences', 'wherewithal', 'conjure', 'own', 'violent', 'images', 'accompany', 'Hilditch', 'collection', 'videotaped', 'other', 'hand', ""n't"", 'rely', 'convoluted', 'psychiatrist', 'explanation', 'explain', 'where', 'Hilditch', 'went', 'wrong', 'simply', 'watch', 'go', 'time']",N/A
