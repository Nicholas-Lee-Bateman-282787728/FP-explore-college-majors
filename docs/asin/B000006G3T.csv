Along the way, we are introduced to the impatient therapist, the ultra-goofy boyfriend, the cranky handyman, and an extremely nasty man named Abner (!). Thankfully, most of these jerks are subjected to horrible deaths at the hands of supernatural forces! This is a horror / thriller along the lines of THE SHINING, THE SENTINEL, BURNT OFFERINGS, etc., and has a solid story w/ a nice, twisty ending.

493804,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B000006G3T,Einsatz,"[12, 17]","For a person suffering from agoraphobia, the lead character, Lauren Cochran (played by Robin Groves) sure got around!  Since the plot never really took full advantage of that, realistically speaking, I can't figure out why it was mentioned so often and used so little.  She was literally running all over the place!  And, it wasn't the least bit interesting.  As horror movies go (and this one really didn't), you need to stay focused, on target.  Pick a plot point and run with it, not just run!The premise was almost too basic: a writer rents a house to write in and soon discovers it's haunted and that she might have some kind of connection to it.  The owner of the house is an old geezer with a secret (the always dependable John Carradine).  To round out the cast there are scads of local creepy people (all connected to THE secret), a nondescript boyfriend, and a rather snotty therapist.  This isn't counting all the ghosts.  The deaths are few and far between but rather well done (I especially love the sickle scene).  I also liked some of the weird dream sequences.  My only major complaint has to do with the casting of Robin Groves as the writer who never gets around to writing.  She is thoroughly unsympathetic, I found her more annoying than likable.  When you can't care about what the main character is suffering through, that doesn't leave much to hold your interest.  It also didn't help that the pacing is a bit slow and the movie is too long.",3,Whicccccccccccccccccck!

It is as good as the likes of The Hearse (sort of a haunted house movie), The Amityville Horror, and Burnt Offerings. This house is even cooler looking than all the other houses (although the Amityville house would give it a run for the money). A writer moves to the country on an R and R trip to get over her agoraphobia in the big city. Little does she know, there are terrible revelations that she begins to discover after she moves in. I've got the Blu-Ray version of this movie and the picture looks very good (about as good as it is going to look). The picture won't stand out but for a film that is over 30 years old it has no flaws in the picture but it still looks like it is from the early 80's. This is a really rare film that not many horror fans know about. It is worth seeing and owning. Glad this arrived on Blu-Ray. Check it out.

Fast forward to present time I saw blue underground was going to releasing it, surprised blue underground put time and effort into a new release and not wasting their time releasing everything they have already released on blue ray, with that said I like blue undergrounds work and I decided to give the movie a second try and I really enjoyed the movie, it's not a bloody or gory movie per say, but it does have its moments and it will not dissapoint (go into the movie with an open mind  Another thing I really appreciated about this movie is that the story is really good, and it does not drag along like the majority of horror movies.

Janovic ""Pre-Socratically!""","[2, 2]","The Nesting looks like it was shot in NY State, which is always a good idea because it has so many great locations that would work in a horror movie, and the makers of this movie found a house as archetypal to horror as the one in Psycho. There's no ghost story in cinema history like this that I've ever seen, and it delivers the good on atmosphere, shock, suspense, and has a few great scares to it. The late seventies and early eighties were a boom period for horror. The Nesting is one that didn't do that badly, but for some reason fell under the cultural radar for a very long time.Blue Underground's claim that it's been &#34;unavailable&#34; on video is generally true. I remember seeing this one time, and one time only on cable in the eighties, never seeing it again until I bought this Blu-ray, incredible, but it was well worth the wait. As usual, BU has done a perfect job here with the transfer, both in sound and audio, boosting the sound up to an optional 7.1 mix. Everything here is real HD.
