I found Hannah to be such an unsympathetic character for being so meek and foolish and full of self-pity. How can she think it was ok to want to marry her half-brother? She took advantage of the well-meaning Fred and trampled on his hopes without a second thought. In comparison, we see her step-sister Margaret, who also experienced disappointment in love, go out and make something happen for herself. Hannah's treatment of her husband was appaling. Fred cared for her while she was sick (after roaming in the rain with another man on her wedding day) and took her on in good faith. In return she cheated on him and had the gall to expect to inherit all his possessions to use for her lover. Hannah showed a level of callousness and disregard that's hard to swallow in a heroine. She lacked the courage and steadiness of character that Margaret had. I kept hoping for Margaret and Fred to get together instead. Ned, played by Clive Owen look-a-like Jonathan Cake,  could have been better as well. His acting was generally good but a bit over the top in some parts. Maybe the weak script was to blame for some of his dialogue. On the plus side, there's a strong supporting cast and great production details to achieve the period look.",1,Most Frustrating Cookson Heroine,1209859200,"05 4, 2008",2008,1354,"['****SPOILERS', '****I', 'normally', 'enjoy', 'Catherine', 'Cookson', 'movies', 'one', 'was', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'had', 'comment', 'found', 'Hannah', 'be', 'such', 'unsympathetic', 'character', 'being', 'so', 'meek', 'foolish', 'full', 'self-pity', 'How', 'can', 'think', 'was', 'ok', 'want', 'marry', 'half-brother', 'took', 'advantage', 'well-meaning', 'Fred', 'trampled', 'hopes', 'second', 'thought', 'comparison', 'see', 'step-sister', 'Margaret', 'who', 'also', 'experienced', 'disappointment', 'love', 'go', 'out', 'make', 'something', 'happen', 'Hannah', 'treatment', 'husband', 'was', 'appaling', 'Fred', 'cared', 'was', 'sick', 'roaming', 'rain', 'man', 'wedding', 'day', 'took', 'good', 'faith', 'return', 'cheated', 'had', 'gall', 'expect', 'inherit', 'possessions', 'use', 'lover', 'Hannah', 'showed', 'level', 'callousness', 'disregard', 'hard', 'swallow', 'heroine', 'lacked', 'courage', 'steadiness', 'character', 'Margaret', 'had', 'kept', 'hoping', 'Margaret', 'Fred', 'get', 'together', 'instead', 'Ned', 'played', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'look-a-like', 'Jonathan', 'Cake', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'as', 'well', 'acting', 'was', 'generally', 'good', 'bit', 'top', 'parts', 'Maybe', 'weak', 'script', 'was', 'blame', 'dialogue', 'plus', 'side', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'great', 'production', 'details', 'achieve', 'period', 'look']",N/A

Maybe they need new glasses.Anyways, i was really wanting to see this movie.The film was very well made (as are most British period films), but i was very disapointed. First of all, no one in the story (set in the 1850's), was very Christian. Seems to me most proper ladies in England, at that time, were much more Christian than portrayed here. I haven't read any of Catherine Cookson's books, but i think the screenplay must have swayed from the original story, at least in that respect.There was way too much emphasis on sadistic attitudes and adulterous characters. Even the character of the heroine cannot be much liked (unless you're a modern-day Jezebel).You want to empathize with her, but her lack of certain morals makes it difficult. Maybe the family in this story just wasn't very Christian, but that's what makes this film lack, in redeeming qualities.Although the costumes and sets, and the acting, were very good...overall, the story was not edifying, or even greatly interesting. If you're a hard-core lover of English period films, you may want to see it...but if you care more for what a family should be able to view, together, then you'd be better off skipping this one.I cannot recommend it for family viewing.*** For period film lovers.** For anyone else.",2,Well made but not very redeeming,1126569600,"09 13, 2005",2005,1366,"['Actually', 'title', 'Girl', 'Why', 'amazom.com', 'i', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Maybe', 'need', 'new', 'glasses.Anyways', 'i', 'was', 'really', 'wanting', 'see', 'movie.The', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'are', 'most', 'British', 'period', 'films', 'i', 'was', 'very', 'disapointed', 'First', 'one', 'story', 'set', '1850', 'was', 'very', 'Christian', 'Seems', 'most', 'proper', 'ladies', 'England', 'time', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'Christian', 'portrayed', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Catherine', 'Cookson', 'books', 'i', 'think', 'screenplay', 'must', 'have', 'swayed', 'original', 'story', 'least', 'respect.There', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'emphasis', 'sadistic', 'attitudes', 'adulterous', 'characters', 'Even', 'character', 'heroine', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'much', 'liked', ""'re"", 'modern-day', 'Jezebel', '.You', 'want', 'empathize', 'lack', 'certain', 'morals', 'difficult', 'Maybe', 'family', 'story', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'Christian', 'what', 'film', 'lack', 'redeeming', 'costumes', 'sets', 'acting', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'overall', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'edifying', 'even', 'greatly', 'interesting', ""'re"", 'hard-core', 'lover', 'English', 'period', 'films', 'may', 'want', 'see', 'care', 'more', 'what', 'family', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'view', 'together', 'then', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'off', 'skipping', 'one.I', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'family', 'viewing', '***', 'period', 'film', 'lovers', '**', 'anyone', 'else']",N/A

666590,A2L6QS8SVHT9RG,B00005N5R7,"randomartco ""period film aficionado""","[0, 0]","This three-part miniseries is based on the book written by Catherine Cookson: it tells the story of ""the girl"", Hannah,  who's ups and downs through life are followed in great detail, as she is left by her poor, dying mother with an upper class family.  The man of the house, her ""father"", she calls fondly ""Mister""...the woman of the house hates her fiercely, and refuses to call her by name: she makes Hannah work in the house like a servant, and refers to her always as ""the girl""...It's the story of life, love, and experience for one young woman who must learn the meaning of love & friendship.For those of you worried about content: be aware that this film is like a period drama soap opera! There are instances of violence, scenes of adultery and premarital sex (although some inferred, some bits shown), a violent beating, quite a bit of blood (a butcher is a main character, although blood is also shown in an accident in the woods), etc.All in all, it was fairly well done, well filmed and entertaining: just be aware that the storyline is not family-friendly: if you are a die-hard period film lover like me, you will want to watch it anyways, to learn more about the time period. This story gives you a peek into a different perspective on life in those times, than if it focused on the grandeur and ease of the upper class: that alone made this film a great peek into the realistic lives of the ""normal"" people of this era.",4,Interesting story & well-filmed but not family friendly!,1132185600,"11 17, 2005",2005,1436,"['three-part', 'miniseries', 'based', 'book', 'written', 'Catherine', 'Cookson', 'story', 'girl', 'Hannah', 'who', 'ups', 'downs', 'life', 'are', 'followed', 'great', 'detail', 'left', 'poor', 'dying', 'mother', 'upper', 'class', 'family', 'man', 'house', 'father', 'fondly', 'Mister', 'woman', 'house', 'fiercely', 'call', 'name', 'Hannah', 'work', 'house', 'servant', 'refers', 'always', 'girl', 'story', 'life', 'love', 'experience', 'one', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'must', 'learn', 'meaning', 'love', 'friendship.For', 'worried', 'content', 'be', 'aware', 'film', 'period', 'drama', 'soap', 'opera', 'are', 'instances', 'violence', 'scenes', 'adultery', 'premarital', 'sex', 'inferred', 'bits', 'shown', 'violent', 'beating', 'quite', 'bit', 'blood', 'butcher', 'main', 'character', 'blood', 'also', 'shown', 'accident', 'woods', 'etc.All', 'was', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'well', 'filmed', 'entertaining', 'just', 'be', 'aware', 'storyline', 'not', 'family-friendly', 'are', 'die-hard', 'period', 'film', 'lover', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'anyways', 'learn', 'more', 'time', 'period', 'story', 'peek', 'different', 'perspective', 'life', 'times', 'focused', 'grandeur', 'ease', 'upper', 'class', 'alone', 'made', 'film', 'great', 'peek', 'realistic', 'lives', 'normal', 'people', 'era']",N/A
