831819,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B0002ERWTG,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[22, 23]","This film gives an ""alternate possibility"" for the eternal life of Judas, after he betrayed the Lord and hung himself on the tree, and though there are many scriptural inaccuracies, the film is always reverent in its portrayal of Jesus, and shows him as strong, and knowing His destiny. Jonathan Scarfe is appealing in the part, and in appearance is light-haired and somewhat like a Durer painting of Christ.As Judas, Jonathon Schaech has a forceful personality and swarthy good looks, and gives us a Judas that above all wants temporal power, has little understanding of the true kingdom of God, and is hostile to anything that doesn't include the expulsion by force of the Romans out of Judea.Pontius Pilate (Tim Matheson) is played as a weak bumbler whose greatest dread is being transferred to Albania because of his ineffectiveness. He also has trouble taking his paws off his skimpily clad wife, Claudia Procles. Claudia (Fiona Glascott in a high camp performance) is a bossy little wench with an annoying voice, and seems to know more about the laws and how to implement them than the men in charge, reminding me of the TV ads where the woman tells the idiot guys where it's at.Others in the cast of note are Owen Teal as Flavius and Bob Gunton as Caiaphas.Filmed in 2001, this sat on the shelf until the interest in Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" spurred the executives at ABC Television to give this a chance, and it was aired in March of 2004.Shot on location in Morocco, it has some nice cinematography by Michael Goi, and a lovely score by Bill Conti; the writing credits go to Executive Producer Tom Fontana (from the sharp and critically acclaimed series ""Homicide: Life on the Streets""), and has some distinctly unbiblical language. It was directed by Charles Robert Carner on a very low budget ($ 5 million) and limited time (23 days), and all this considered, it is an entertaining, and occasionally moving film.I have to confess that I didn't care for it much the first time I saw it, but subsequent viewings gave me more appreciation of it.The message it imparts according to Paulist Productions is that ""It's never too late to turn back to God"".Total running time is 120 minutes.",4,"""It's never too late""",1093737600,"08 29, 2004",2004,2209,"['film', 'alternate', 'possibility', 'eternal', 'life', 'Judas', 'betrayed', 'Lord', 'hung', 'tree', 'are', 'many', 'scriptural', 'inaccuracies', 'film', 'always', 'reverent', 'portrayal', 'Jesus', 'strong', 'knowing', 'destiny', 'Jonathan', 'Scarfe', 'appealing', 'part', 'appearance', 'light-haired', 'somewhat', 'Durer', 'painting', 'Christ.As', 'Judas', 'Jonathon', 'Schaech', 'forceful', 'personality', 'swarthy', 'good', 'looks', 'Judas', 'temporal', 'power', 'little', 'understanding', 'true', 'kingdom', 'God', 'hostile', 'anything', ""n't"", 'include', 'expulsion', 'force', 'Romans', 'Judea.Pontius', 'Pilate', 'Tim', 'Matheson', 'played', 'weak', 'bumbler', 'greatest', 'dread', 'being', 'transferred', 'Albania', 'ineffectiveness', 'also', 'trouble', 'taking', 'paws', 'skimpily', 'clad', 'wife', 'Claudia', 'Procles', 'Claudia', 'Fiona', 'Glascott', 'high', 'camp', 'performance', 'bossy', 'little', 'wench', 'annoying', 'voice', 'know', 'more', 'laws', 'how', 'implement', 'men', 'charge', 'reminding', 'TV', 'ads', 'where', 'woman', 'idiot', 'where', 'at.Others', 'cast', 'note', 'are', 'Owen', 'Teal', 'Flavius', 'Bob', 'Gunton', 'Caiaphas.Filmed', '2001', 'sat', 'shelf', 'interest', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'spurred', 'executives', 'ABC', 'Television', 'give', 'chance', 'was', 'aired', 'March', '2004.Shot', 'location', 'Morocco', 'nice', 'cinematography', 'Michael', 'Goi', 'lovely', 'score', 'Bill', 'Conti', 'writing', 'credits', 'go', 'Executive', 'Producer', 'Tom', 'Fontana', 'sharp', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'series', 'Homicide', 'Life', 'Streets', 'distinctly', 'unbiblical', 'language', 'was', 'directed', 'Charles', 'Robert', 'Carner', 'very', 'low', 'budget', '5', 'million', 'limited', 'time', '23', 'days', 'considered', 'entertaining', 'occasionally', 'moving', 'film.I', 'have', 'confess', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'subsequent', 'viewings', 'gave', 'more', 'appreciation', 'it.The', 'message', 'according', 'Paulist', 'Productions', 'never', 'too', 'late', 'turn', 'back', 'God', '.Total', 'running', 'time', '120', 'minutes']",Judas

831821,A111TATNFNSU3X,B0002ERWTG,Knight Poet,"[1, 1]","SPOILER ALERT! My comments pertain primarily to the ending of this movie so I'd recommend NOT reading past this point if you haven't already seen it. As with most movies, there were some scenes that I liked more than others. But rather than dwell on the ones I didn't like, I'm choosing instead to reflect positively on my favorite scene, this being the last one. The image I recall is one where a couple of Jesus' apostles were praying over the lifeless body of Judas who had committed the final act in the drama of fleeing from the realities of mortal existence. Something was spoken about their prayers being in accordance with what Jesus would want them to do. And then as the praying voices of these devotedly loyal apostles gradually fades into the shadow-kissed corners of the smoothly transitionalized soundstage, the voice of the Master Himself fades in until the perceived volume of Jesus' voice praying in unison with the apostles goes from being equally mixed with them to being the only one reciting this prayer to the end followed only by a momentary pause filled with the lingering void of dead silence (part of my emphasis here is on my recollection of the absence in this scene of an irrelevant musical score or any other artificially contrived elements of sound design). This was more than just a passionately powerful method of using an audio track to creatively suggest that Jesus had magnificently triumphed over physical death just as He had said He would (since only the Living Spirit of a Crucifixion-Conquering Jesus would be praying WITH these apostles at this moment in the sequence of events being portrayed). For me, this scene was also a gentle reminder that the Timeless Truths Jesus eloquently expressed through His love-dominated actions and words are just as supremely relevant and important today as the faith-fact of His morontia resurrection three days after an unsuccessful legal attempt was made to shut Him up using a handful of rusty old nails and a trembling tree of torture.",5,The Value of a Well-Executed Audio Enhancement,1331251200,"03 9, 2012",2012,2017,"['SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'comments', 'pertain', 'primarily', 'ending', 'movie', 'so', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'NOT', 'reading', 'point', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'seen', 'most', 'movies', 'were', 'scenes', 'liked', 'more', 'others', 'rather', 'dwell', 'ones', 'did', ""n't"", ""'m"", 'choosing', 'instead', 'reflect', 'positively', 'favorite', 'scene', 'being', 'last', 'one', 'image', 'recall', 'one', 'where', 'couple', 'Jesus', 'apostles', 'were', 'praying', 'lifeless', 'body', 'Judas', 'who', 'had', 'committed', 'final', 'act', 'drama', 'fleeing', 'realities', 'mortal', 'existence', 'Something', 'was', 'spoken', 'prayers', 'being', 'accordance', 'what', 'Jesus', 'would', 'want', 'do', 'then', 'praying', 'voices', 'devotedly', 'loyal', 'apostles', 'gradually', 'shadow-kissed', 'corners', 'smoothly', 'transitionalized', 'soundstage', 'voice', 'Master', 'Himself', 'perceived', 'volume', 'Jesus', 'voice', 'praying', 'unison', 'apostles', 'being', 'equally', 'mixed', 'being', 'only', 'one', 'reciting', 'prayer', 'end', 'followed', 'only', 'momentary', 'pause', 'filled', 'lingering', 'void', 'dead', 'silence', 'part', 'emphasis', 'here', 'recollection', 'absence', 'scene', 'irrelevant', 'musical', 'score', 'other', 'artificially', 'contrived', 'elements', 'sound', 'design', 'was', 'more', 'just', 'passionately', 'powerful', 'method', 'using', 'audio', 'track', 'creatively', 'suggest', 'Jesus', 'had', 'magnificently', 'triumphed', 'over', 'physical', 'death', 'just', 'had', 'said', 'would', 'only', 'Living', 'Spirit', 'Crucifixion-Conquering', 'Jesus', 'would', 'be', 'praying', 'WITH', 'apostles', 'moment', 'sequence', 'events', 'being', 'portrayed', 'scene', 'was', 'also', 'gentle', 'reminder', 'Timeless', 'Truths', 'Jesus', 'eloquently', 'expressed', 'love-dominated', 'actions', 'words', 'are', 'just', 'supremely', 'relevant', 'important', 'today', 'faith-fact', 'morontia', 'resurrection', 'three', 'days', 'unsuccessful', 'legal', 'attempt', 'was', 'made', 'shut', 'Him', 'up', 'using', 'handful', 'rusty', 'old', 'nails', 'trembling', 'tree', 'torture']",Judas
831822,A1PVM3V959JFYM,B0002ERWTG,Lovely to See You,"[2, 4]","Okay, while not the world's most devout Christian, this reviewer received strict Lutheran scholastic instruction for 10 years, and you know what they say about your formative years.  Let's sum this up quickly from the point of view of one of the alleged ""target audience"" members:  This is the ""Johnny Schaech show"", not unlike every other movie he has too large a part in.  One of the luckiest pretty boys in the recent crop of hot young actors, he's okay in supporting roles like That Thing You Do, simply because he can't act his way out of a wet paper bag with a gaping hole in it.  He certainly proves that in this movie.The writing of this film is a Biblical abomination, and the portrayal of Judas as having been against Christ all along isn't even close to the truth.  I don't know what's more annoying; Jesus being portrayed as a pouting metro who looks like anyone shouting at him will make him cry like a five year-old, or Judas Johnny shouting orders at him all the time.  My favorite part is when he tells Jesus he doesn't want to hear anymore about his Father, and he'd better do what he says.  Hmm, that's really some great writing there.  You're going to boss around a man you've seen heal lepers and raise the dead?  I DID think it was funny when he was out stalling for time while Andrew was in a dead woman's tomb alone and raised her from the dead with the Lord's Prayer, though.Yeah, there's another point of contention:  Why do they show very few miracles, yet talk about them endlessly.  This movie wouldn't make a convert of a fallen priest, much less someone who has never heard these stories before.  I dislike highly when filmmakers mess with Bible stories to this degree, yet I love the Story of Ruth (The 1960 version with Elana Eden and Tom Tryon.), though most of it is pure fancy.  Why?  Because it is compatible with scripture.In the meantime, if you love scowling, head shaking, and bad acting on a wide-scale level, the ""Johnny Schaech show"" is your dream come true.  Somebody else here has already suggested the accurate, well-acted, phenominally directed, and truthful film, Jesus of Nazareth.

831823,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B0002ERWTG,Michael Butts,"[11, 13]","Long considered the necessary scapegoat in the crucifixion of Christ, Judas Iscariot has remained a mystery in many ways.  If he was ""predestined"" to be the one who betrays Jesus, why did it make sense for him to be the one?  As portrayed in this movie, Judas was a militant, one who wanted power and glory in his quest to liberate the Jews from the Romans power.  He was also jealous of Jesus' love for anyone else, and his despair as necessary as Jesus' execution.Johnathon Schaech has the brooding sensitivity to adequately bring his role to life; Jonathan Scarfe as Jesus is a little too Scandinavian to be convincing in appearance, yet he delivers his lines earnestly and with religious fervor; Tim Matheson seems a little too ""Hollywood"" in his portrayal of Pilate.Filmed in a brief time and on a shoestring budget, ""Judas"" received attention after the phenomenal success of ""The Passion of the Christ.""
