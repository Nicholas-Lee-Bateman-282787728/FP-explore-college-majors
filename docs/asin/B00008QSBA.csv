The local women love their good looks and charm. The men also have a HQ underneath the flower shop, where they gather to receive orders for their secret missions. Orders given by a mysterious figure known only as Persia and Manx. The Weiss Kruez team are very skilled assassins that go after criminals and murderes that the police can't put away.  At the end of every episode, the criminals always get killed by the WK team. This is one of my favorite anime titles. It has the right balance of storytelling and action sequences. The characters are all very likable, and get fully developed, the team works well together and avoids the stereotypical bickering that many team/buddy stories have. The artwork and animation looks very out-dated but this show is more about the story. The sound fx were good as was the music- tense and action packed. This anime feels a lot like a police drama; but adds to it with an air of creepiness because of the sadistic criminals commiting crimes. Crimes you hear about on the 11 o'clock news.  The biggest factor in making this anime great is the sense of satisfaction it gives you when the bad guys feel terrified and get assassinated in a brutal fashion. Justice and retribution is the underlying theme that makes this anime worth watching. Throw in some intrigue and you've got Weiss Kreuz. Many of the episodes are self contianed, others continue. Contains blood, gore and light nudity. Good for adults only.

You have to take these guys for what they are cute and with a bad script.  However Weiss Kreuz is a classic and for all its cheesiness I love it. Im still totally in love with little boy Omi and that squeak as he pretends not to understand sexual inuendo.A great bonus is the reel of voice actors mistakes and deliberates flubs.

746728,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00008QSBA,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","While I would never claim to be an expert in the anime field, I have done some experimentation and found quite a few great items. Besides the dozens of classic films I have collected, I have also purchased and enjoyed several series including the macabre ""Hellsing,"" the moody ""Noir,"" the fast and funny ""Cowboy Bebop""and my favorite--the sublime ""Berserk."" Having never heard of ""Knight Hunters,"" I picked it up on the basis of its description. There seem to be a lot of people who have enjoyed this series, but for me, it lacked the sophistication and overall quality of the other programs that I have seen. That may be its intent--again I'm under no illusions as a true connoisseur--but its lack of artistry, over-the-top dramatics, and groan-worthy dubbed dialogue had me laughing more often than I would care to mention.The setup of ""Knight Hunters"" is a good one. Four young men, working undercover in a flower shop by day, form a secret organization that hunts evil by night. Getting their secret assignments, they leap into action--each with a unique fighting style. The plot, for what it is, is serviceable. Some of the stand alone capers are effective, some are cheesy. But the series does manage to weave a fairly intricate plot with recurring villains with grand designs on conquering the world. Our heroes love and lose, get betrayed, uncover family secrets and go through some pretty interesting scenarios as the story progresses. For the most part, I enjoyed the primary story arc--and that is what saved this series from being a complete disaster.For what I enjoyed in the plot development, however, I truly loathed most of the dialogue. I don't know if this is from the original series or if something was lost in translation--but I am commenting on the dubbed version available here. From the very beginning, as hordes of schoolgirls swarm the flower shop to ogle our hunky heroes, the dialogue is so preposterous and awkward. While fighting crime, things are fine--but when things slow down and we attempt character development, it can be almost painful. There are peculiar moments of exposition and strange romantic exchanges that sound bizarre, campy and infantile. The actors employed seem to be reading, not acting, and so the dramatics fall flat--and then in heightened moments, we swung into the realm of stilted overacting. It really, really detracts from what might have been a lot more involving.I couldn't, ultimately, take ""Knight Hunters"" very seriously. But I'm not trying to detract anyone from checking this out. Maybe the subtitles would be better--but I still wouldn't rank this in the same league as the programs I mentioned in the first paragraph. I would recommend that you try to sample an episode, if possible, before making the financial commitment.PS. Using the other shows I liked as a reference, if anyone wants to recommend another series, I'm all ears.
