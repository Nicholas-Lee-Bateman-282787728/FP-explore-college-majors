1248886,A1YGYE2C5JZVD3,B0021UDX8I,audie snyder,"[1, 1]",The majority of the DVD deals with the author's presentation on the appearance of homo sapiens at an evolutionary time that doesn't make sense. He is great at the use of science and logic to show in plain terms how the only explanation must be intervention. The remaining part of the DVD deals with what seems to be the real deal... an alien skull! Will seriously cause you to think.

Hauser""","[0, 0]","Okay, forget everything you know, or think you know, about evolution and human origins--we are, instead, alien visitors from outer space.  At some point in Earth's history, humans arrived--they weren't formed over millions of years from an ape-like ancestor.  The actual science for this is explained in this DVD, and unless you're a forensics expert, a bit mind-numbing.  Since there's a whole branch of science to understand evolution, it's not surprising there's a lot to say about an opposing theory.  At over two hours of lecture, there's much to think about here, but unfortunately, even though expert Lloyd Pye is actually holding a microphone, the camera mic is apparently (you guessed it) on the camera, which makes it hard to hear.",3,Lloyd Pye's theory explained,1276214400,"06 11, 2010",2010,741,"['Okay', 'forget', 'everything', 'know', 'think', 'know', 'evolution', 'human', 'origins', 'are', 'instead', 'alien', 'visitors', 'outer', 'space', 'point', 'Earth', 'history', 'arrived', 'were', ""n't"", 'formed', 'millions', 'years', 'ape-like', 'ancestor', 'actual', 'science', 'explained', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'forensics', 'expert', 'bit', 'mind-numbing', 'whole', 'branch', 'science', 'understand', 'evolution', 'not', 'surprising', 'lot', 'say', 'opposing', 'theory', 'two', 'hours', 'lecture', 'much', 'think', 'here', 'unfortunately', 'even', 'expert', 'Lloyd', 'Pye', 'actually', 'holding', 'microphone', 'camera', 'mic', 'apparently', 'guessed', 'camera', 'hard', 'hear']",Alien Origins by Lloyd Pye
