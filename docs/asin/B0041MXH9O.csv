Hearn,"[3, 3]","I'm sure this will sound &#34;petty&#34;, but one thing that annoys me to no end is that there is no &#34;consistency&#34; as to how people pronounce &#34;Kapaun&#34;.  Even the same person will say his name two different ways.  Pick one and stick to it!  hahahahaThe first part has a lot to do with a miracle which is attributed to Father Kapaun.  For me, I would have preferred that part be at the end, so that you learn more about Father Kapaun himself at the start.When the film was created they mention that Father Kapaun has been nominated for the Medal of Honor.

1381942,A2UITTZE0YDER2,B0041MXH9O,"ServusDei ""udayajmj""","[40, 42]","An excellent documentary on the life of Father Emil Kapaun, the hard working farm-boy from rural Kansas, who answers God's call to be a priest. Deciding that he could serve God better by ministering to the US marines during the 2nd World War he enlists and becomes an army chaplain. He proves himself to be a true spiritual father to these young men and a true comrade.This is the story of a remarkable man whose love for God, country and fellow man would take him through 2 wars and finally to his own Calvary, at the hands of communists, far away from home. This short documentary of 52 minutes portrays a man of deep spirituality, immense courage and a deep charity for his neighbor.Fr. Kapaun is truly an 'alter-Christus'....another Christ. This documentary has interviews with soldiers who knew him personally and suffered with him, until his untimely death, people from his town and the amazing healing of a high school student through his intercession.It is utterly riveting.Fr. Kapaun wasn't a man to shy away from problems. He faced them head on staring it in the face. He believed in God, in his fellow man and in  fighting evil. He was called to serve and he served till the very end, in a hell hole in the far reaches of China, where he and his fellow POW's were incarcerated in the most inhumane conditions. His life is a testimony to the Eternal Truth that is Jesus Christ, and that the truth can not and should not be compromised, even in the face of death.At a time when men fail to be men, Fr.Kapaun stands as a beacon of what true Christian manliness is all about. TRUTH, INTEGRITY, CHARITY and in the SERVICE OF GOD.A very inspirational documentary for everyone but particularly for teenagers and young men!This DVD comes with a prayer card for the cause of Fr.

1381943,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,B0041MXH9O,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[0, 0]","This 50-minute documentary produced by the Wichita Eagle Newspaper tells the extraordinary story of a Korean War chaplain simultaneously awarded the Medal of Honor (although it hadn't happened when this documentary was filmed in 2009, President Obama gave him the award posthumously in April 2013) and up for consideration as a canonized saint in the Roman Catholic Church. This man was Father Emil Kapaun, a Kansas-born priest who served as an army chaplain in WWII and Korea. The film deftly weaves the narratives of his life, his war exploits, and his current cause for sainthood with a touching depth of emotion. It even includes Kapaun's own voice from old radio sermons he gave. Interviewees include a young man who recovered from a fatal pole vaulting accident in college (he missed the mat and landed on his head) after his family prayed to Father Kapaun; this alleged miracle is being reviewed by the Vatican as possible evidence for Kapaun's canonization. The young man's mother and family are also interviewed. Also included are comments by the local Catholic bishop (Diocese of Wichita) and priest who is promoting Kapaun's cause for sainthood, as well as interviews with people who knew Kapaun in Kansas. But the most impressive thing about this video are the firsthand accounts of American GIs who served with Kapaun in Korea, including one elderly man Kapaun saved from being shot by a Chinese officer. This segment of the film is genuinely touching as the army veterans recall Kapaun's heroism and their love for him. The film concludes with an epilogue about Kapaun's then-nomination for the Medal of Honor (look it up on the White House website if you want footage and text of President Obama's remarks at the ceremony where he ultimately gave the medal to Kapaun's nephew) and cause for sainthood in the Roman Catholic Church, where Fr. Kapaun is currently a &#34;servant of God&#34; as his case proceeds. If you want to learn about the impact that military chaplains have in battle, or simply about the process of making someone a saint in the Roman Catholic Church, then this is absolutely the best documentary you will find anywhere. I showed it in class to 14-year olds and they were riveted by the whole thing.",5,Great documentary on Korean War chaplain awarded Medal of Honor by President Obama,1383609600,"11 5, 2013",2013,2234,"['50-minute', 'documentary', 'produced', 'Wichita', 'Eagle', 'Newspaper', 'extraordinary', 'story', 'Korean', 'War', 'chaplain', 'simultaneously', 'awarded', 'Medal', 'Honor', 'had', ""n't"", 'happened', 'when', 'documentary', 'was', 'filmed', '2009', 'President', 'Obama', 'gave', 'award', 'posthumously', 'April', '2013', 'up', 'consideration', 'canonized', 'saint', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'man', 'was', 'Father', 'Emil', 'Kapaun', 'Kansas-born', 'priest', 'who', 'served', 'army', 'chaplain', 'WWII', 'Korea', 'film', 'deftly', 'narratives', 'life', 'war', 'exploits', 'current', 'cause', 'sainthood', 'touching', 'depth', 'emotion', 'even', 'Kapaun', 'own', 'voice', 'old', 'radio', 'sermons', 'gave', 'Interviewees', 'include', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'recovered', 'fatal', 'pole', 'vaulting', 'accident', 'college', 'missed', 'mat', 'landed', 'head', 'family', 'prayed', 'Father', 'Kapaun', 'alleged', 'miracle', 'being', 'reviewed', 'Vatican', 'possible', 'evidence', 'Kapaun', 'canonization', 'young', 'man', 'mother', 'family', 'are', 'also', 'interviewed', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'comments', 'local', 'Catholic', 'bishop', 'Diocese', 'Wichita', 'priest', 'who', 'promoting', 'Kapaun', 'cause', 'sainthood', 'as', 'well', 'interviews', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'Kapaun', 'Kansas', 'most', 'impressive', 'thing', 'video', 'are', 'firsthand', 'accounts', 'American', 'GIs', 'who', 'served', 'Kapaun', 'Korea', 'including', 'one', 'elderly', 'man', 'Kapaun', 'saved', 'being', 'shot', 'Chinese', 'officer', 'segment', 'film', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'army', 'recall', 'Kapaun', 'heroism', 'love', 'film', 'epilogue', 'Kapaun', 'then-nomination', 'Medal', 'Honor', 'look', 'up', 'White', 'House', 'website', 'want', 'footage', 'text', 'President', 'Obama', 'remarks', 'ceremony', 'where', 'ultimately', 'gave', 'medal', 'Kapaun', 'nephew', 'cause', 'sainthood', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'where', 'Fr', 'Kapaun', 'currently', '34', 'servant', 'God', '34', 'case', 'proceeds', 'want', 'learn', 'impact', 'military', 'chaplains', 'have', 'battle', 'simply', 'process', 'making', 'someone', 'saint', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'then', 'absolutely', 'best', 'documentary', 'will', 'find', 'anywhere', 'showed', 'class', '14-year', 'olds', 'were', 'riveted', 'whole', 'thing']",N/A
