1115962,AG5XM49AZVIYH,B000Y36PYS,"Ben ""Pizza Enthusiast""","[1, 1]","Like a handful of others, I chose to watch ""Fraulein"" in large part due to the excellent reviews it has received here on Amazon. Its short duration was also appealing; regrettably, I do not always have time to watch longer films in one sitting, and I absolutely hate having to pause a movie and come back to it later. Unfortunately, viewing ""Fraulein"" turned out to be a waste of time.I found this film to be extraordinarily slow. ""Fraulein"" is a story about one young woman's (Ana) unlikely impact on an older woman (Ruza). It becomes apparent early in the film that Ana is afflicted by a serious illness (which goes unnamed until late in the movie- watch out for spoilers in some of the other reviews), yet she remains a free, joyful spirit in spite of this. By contrast, Ruza is extremely boring and quite obviously content with her uninteresting life. The audience is subjected to long scenes of Ruza executing her daily routine which, as far as I can tell, are only included in the movie to demonstrate just how bland she really is. Mila, an employee at Ruza's restaurant who is equally dull and older still, also appears in a number of lengthy scenes. Far too much time is devoted to showing the audience just how boring these two women are.While the acting is very good in ""Fraulein,"" the characters are not well-developed. Apparently, the audience is supposed to feel sympathy for all three of the main characters, but very little backstory is provided to direct viewers' emotions. While I got the impression I was supposed to pity Ruza, almost nothing she did on-screen motivated me to do so. The audience is shown everything and told very little. In this case, ""less"" unsuccessfully tries to be ""more.""Ana is by far the most interesting character in the film, though she also comes across as somewhat contrived. Actress Marija Scaricic is not at fault for this- in fact, her performance is very solid. Instead, it is the result of a painfully average script. The dialogue contains little of the emotion the actresses display; there are more examples of irritating camera-work than interesting ones. Overall, though, I do not have much to critique technically, especially given what I imagine to be a meager budget for ""Fraulein.""Ultimately, ""Fraulein"" failed to move me. Although there are a few very good scenes, the film as a whole is uninspiring. The dialogue fails to deliver the intended drama (mostly because of poor writing), and many of the silent scenes just drag on and on. In the end, I cared very little about Ruza, far less about Mila, and was only somewhat sympathetic to Ana, who (I think) was supposed to be a tragic hero of sorts. Regardless, I don't have the desire to slog through ""Fraulein"" again to try to sort out what I saw. Even an hour and fifteen minutes is too much time to devote to this exceptionally boring film.",2,Snoozer.,1354492800,"12 3, 2012",2012,2852,"['handful', 'others', 'chose', 'watch', 'Fraulein', 'large', 'part', 'due', 'excellent', 'reviews', 'received', 'here', 'Amazon', 'short', 'duration', 'was', 'also', 'appealing', 'regrettably', 'do', 'not', 'always', 'have', 'time', 'watch', 'longer', 'films', 'one', 'sitting', 'absolutely', 'hate', 'having', 'pause', 'movie', 'come', 'back', 'later', 'Unfortunately', 'viewing', 'Fraulein', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'waste', 'time.I', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'extraordinarily', 'slow', 'Fraulein', 'story', 'one', 'young', 'woman', 'Ana', 'unlikely', 'impact', 'older', 'woman', 'Ruza', 'apparent', 'early', 'film', 'Ana', 'afflicted', 'serious', 'illness', 'unnamed', 'late', 'movie-', 'watch', 'spoilers', 'other', 'reviews', 'yet', 'free', 'joyful', 'spirit', 'spite', 'contrast', 'Ruza', 'extremely', 'boring', 'quite', 'obviously', 'content', 'uninteresting', 'life', 'audience', 'subjected', 'long', 'scenes', 'Ruza', 'executing', 'daily', 'routine', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'are', 'only', 'included', 'movie', 'demonstrate', 'just', 'how', 'bland', 'really', 'Mila', 'employee', 'Ruza', 'restaurant', 'who', 'equally', 'dull', 'older', 'still', 'also', 'number', 'lengthy', 'scenes', 'Far', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'devoted', 'showing', 'audience', 'just', 'how', 'boring', 'two', 'women', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'Fraulein', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'well-developed', 'Apparently', 'audience', 'supposed', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'very', 'little', 'backstory', 'provided', 'direct', 'viewers', 'emotions', 'got', 'impression', 'was', 'supposed', 'pity', 'Ruza', 'almost', 'nothing', 'did', 'on-screen', 'motivated', 'do', 'so', 'audience', 'shown', 'everything', 'told', 'very', 'little', 'case', 'less', 'unsuccessfully', 'be', 'more', 'Ana', 'far', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'film', 'also', 'across', 'somewhat', 'contrived', 'Actress', 'Marija', 'Scaricic', 'not', 'fault', 'this-', 'fact', 'performance', 'very', 'solid', 'Instead', 'result', 'painfully', 'average', 'script', 'dialogue', 'little', 'emotion', 'actresses', 'display', 'are', 'more', 'examples', 'irritating', 'camera-work', 'interesting', 'ones', 'Overall', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'critique', 'technically', 'especially', 'given', 'what', 'imagine', 'be', 'meager', 'budget', 'Fraulein', 'Ultimately', 'Fraulein', 'failed', 'move', 'are', 'few', 'very', 'good', 'scenes', 'film', 'whole', 'uninspiring', 'dialogue', 'deliver', 'intended', 'drama', 'mostly', 'poor', 'writing', 'many', 'silent', 'scenes', 'just', 'drag', 'end', 'cared', 'very', 'little', 'Ruza', 'far', 'less', 'Mila', 'was', 'only', 'somewhat', 'sympathetic', 'Ana', 'who', 'think', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'tragic', 'hero', 'sorts', 'Regardless', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'desire', 'slog', 'Fraulein', 'again', 'try', 'sort', 'out', 'what', 'saw', 'Even', 'hour', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'devote', 'exceptionally', 'boring', 'film']",Fraulein
1115963,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B000Y36PYS,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[56, 59]","This is far and above the absolute best Film Movements film in the series. I haven't seen or heard a film this well done in a very long time. Buy or rent this film.The opening scene sets the tone of this film. We see a man pruning trees. The only sound we hear is the sound of his saw cutting the thin young branches. The last sound we hear is the click of a branch breaking off, but don't see that branch break. The scene is very gray, overcast sky, and in the winter. It is a metaphor for the rest of the film.So many films start with a particular style, something different. It catches your eye or your ears or your mind. About 2/3 to 3/4 of the way through they lose that style and return to the same old melodrama we've all seen before. Not this film. That sound, the sparse clear perfectly recorded sound works throughout this film. The gray skies, the fabulous framing, the perfect editing, those play all the way to the end of Fraulein. There was a unique style all the way to the end of the film.This is the story of two women. Ana has left Sarejvo after the war. Ruza is the owner of a very gray working man's restaurant (cafeteria would be more like it). The two meet in Ruza's, aptly named simply ""Restaurant.""This is a part of Zurich no tourist has ever seen. It overlooks the city we all know along the lake. This is the working area of Zurich. If I were to describe more of this film, it would ruin the discovery process essential to the story line and enjoyment.I don't want to oversell this film. It's a remarkable small film that was done on a very low budget. It demonstrates that fantastic stories and an amazing film style do not require millions of dollars to film. I was astounded by the clarity of sound, and how it was almost another character. I was surprised by the wonderful perfomances of these two women. I felt like I got to know them both well. And was amazed at the camera work and framing.If you're familiar with the Film Movement series, you will love this film. If not, then this might just be the introduction you need to start watching very fine new cinema from around the world.By the way - Happiness, the short that accompanies Fraulein, is the best one they have ever bundled.

The title, FRAULEIN, interested me, as I had spent several years in Germany in my youth and was curious because of the German/Serbian/Bosnian/Croatian subtitles. (I was hoping I'd recall what little German I learned while I was there.) But, as soon as this picture started, I was drawn into it. It was both hopeful and heartbreaking. And I especially liked the character of Ana (Marija Skaricic) from Sarajevo, who brought her plain beauty, youth, and energy into the lives of the two older women she met and befriended: Ruza (Marjiana Karanovic), the cold, joyless Serbian owner of a Swiss canteen, who hires Ana to do menial tasks and, at first, resists Ana's attempts to turn the workplace into a bright and welcoming stop for people going to and coming from their humdrum jobs, as well as the dishwashers, cooks, and busboys who work there; and Mila,(a Croatian) who isn't all that sure if she wants to leave Switzerland and her grown children and return to Croatia with her retired husband to build his dream house. That is, until they both learn more about the life-loving Ana. Ana..., for all her youthful energy and passion, has a secret that she keeps deep within her that causes her to live life to the fullest and bring hope for the future to the two women she emotionally touches.OK...I haven't really said anything to spoil this film for anyone who might want to take a chance and watch it. I just wanted to say that FRAULEIN isn't really just an Eastern European Chick-flick.

Actually every actor is superb and although this story leaves much to the imagination, as a lover of simplicity, I adore this character driven film.  Every frame is intentional, each action is necessary, there is not a thing wasted in this low budget production which surpasses many films that cost ten times its budget.  The audio effects were expertly done, including even the background movement of cars in a parking lot.  From a production standpoint, this was a ten.  In less than an hour and a half, we learned how humans share their lives with only a few words spoken relying on their gestures and actions to propel the story.  Where Woody Allen's characters erupt in verbose thoughts, these characters internalize, reminiscent of New Wave films.  As an example, rather than carry on about a woman watching her life go down the drain, we see her watch the sudsy water flow from the sink.

1115972,AV5H2I9CHN8YI,B000Y36PYS,N. Gregg,"[1, 2]","English subtitled small low-budget film, a simple story nicely done.Ruza is a lonely 50-ish single woman who owns/runs a restaurant (really more like a cafeteria).  She is strictly business and has built up thick walls - she doesn't get close to anyone or let anyone get close to her. A drab existence really, but since she's independent and has her own business she feels she's ""made it"".Ana is a young woman (about 22) new in town without a plan, a bit of coin in her pocket, knows no one. She keeps her small bag of stuff in a little locker at the bus station and goes home with whatever new friends she makes.  One day Ana is in her restaurant and sees that an older employee has cut herself and she goes behind the counter to help her with the cut.  She notices that the serving line is stopped without the injured woman so she jumps in to help out. She is then offered a position, which she eventually takes but lets Ruza know she is just passing through.In her brief stay in town, Ana manages to basically bulldoze past Ruzas protective walls, and breathe ""life"" back into her before moving on - also making the other workers (and patrons) lives a little better in the process.Ana has leukemia and is in remission, and has decided to LIVE and enjoy every moment she has left (and not spend it getting treatment if she can avoid it). She keeps her illness to herself, but eventually confides to Ruza towards the end of the movie after they have become friends, as the ""remission"" ends.This is not an ""exciting"" movie, sortof just ordinary life, and a brief snippet of Anas life at that.  You don't get to learn a whole lot about her past, where she's going when she leaves town or what happens to her, but it's not really important to the film.It's nice that she does what she can to enjoy simple things and people.
