After watching Private Benjamin for the second time in several decades, I'm not certain he's wrong.  Abysmal at making choices, Judy Benjamin (played by Goldie Hawn), is not the brightest character ever written.  From start to finish, we watch her struggle with one bad decision after another.  That she occasionally succeeded seemed more fluke than any level of maturity on her part.  That this was dubbed a comedy is even more mystifying.  I found this movie incredibly sad.  Judy Benjamin stubbles and bumbles her way through life, a creature of bad habits, then, at the eleventh hour, has an epiphany and makes another bad decision (why walk when you can ride?).  I don't see anything triumphant in her finally averting disaster.  I also have absolutely no confidence that the rest of her life would be any better.  This was not a happy movie and I did not enjoy watching it.  And by the way, widescreen would not have helped.As for Protocol, there's a movie that managed to insult just about everyone.Once again, Goldie and giggle affects another nave nincompoop.  Here she plays a simpleton among snakes, poor Sunny without a clue who stumbles into the role of a heroine.  She's so cartoonish it's impossible to find a shred of humanity in her portrayal.  Her circumstance is so outrageous it defies even base humor.  The rest of the cardboard cast doesn't help.  The four conspiring villains are all of one note, like a Greek Chorus, shrill at the same time; it was incredibly annoying, not funny.  That Sunny is finally given away like a gift basket of fruit was, for me, that last I could take; I truly didn't believe it could get any worse than that.  I was wrong.  The rest of the movie drowns in so much sanctimonious drivel I thought my head would explode.

450959,A228JH8V9Y700G,6305133425,MortensOrchid,"[1, 1]","In her classic somewhat dizzy but always likeable role, Goldie Hawn plays Sunny Davis, an unassuming, average gal who happens to stumble into some unbelievable circumstances.  Sunny is a cocktail waitress in Washington, DC, who while standing outside watching a crowd scene, happens to be standing next to a guy who pulls a gun.  In an act of heroics, she grabs the gun and thwarts his attempt on an Arab royal.  She becomes a media darling afterward, appearing on many covers of magazines and being praised for her act.  A government department, in an effort to cash in on this gal's 15 minutes, invites her to become a representative of the Washington Protocol department, preforming acts of international diplomacy.  She bungles through much of it, but approaches things with a sense of humor and brings a lightheartedness to the otherwise stuffy parties and duties.  In an odd twist, Sunny was unknowningly promised to the Emir whose life she saved as a wife.  She is then traded to him in exchange for military supplies and loyalty.  A rather quirky movie that had always been in my favorite list.While the humor is obvious (fish out of water, culture and class conflict, etc.), there are some lessons to be learned.  Sunny is and all American gal who doesn't know much about the world she lives in.  Indeed, when she is brought before a committee to investigate the goings on of her trade to the Emir, she spells it out by saying that she is responsible for all the problems.  She bought all the fame and fortune and glam without knowing what she was getting.  She never read the paper, never read the Declaration of Independence before taking some visiting dignitaries to see it, and never watched the news.  She wasn't concerned with those things.  But once she was thrust into the middle of it, she suddenly was.  How many of us will end up in this situation?  Very few.  But we do owe it to ourselves to be more informed and see the forest from the trees.  Perhaps her example will serve for some change.",4,Funny and makes you think,1184112000,"07 11, 2007",2007,2014,"['classic', 'somewhat', 'dizzy', 'always', 'likeable', 'role', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'Sunny', 'Davis', 'unassuming', 'average', 'gal', 'who', 'stumble', 'unbelievable', 'circumstances', 'Sunny', 'cocktail', 'waitress', 'Washington', 'DC', 'who', 'standing', 'outside', 'watching', 'crowd', 'scene', 'be', 'standing', 'next', 'guy', 'who', 'gun', 'act', 'heroics', 'grabs', 'gun', 'attempt', 'Arab', 'royal', 'media', 'darling', 'afterward', 'appearing', 'many', 'covers', 'magazines', 'being', 'praised', 'act', 'government', 'department', 'effort', 'cash', 'gal', '15', 'minutes', 'become', 'representative', 'Washington', 'Protocol', 'department', 'preforming', 'acts', 'international', 'diplomacy', 'much', 'things', 'sense', 'humor', 'lightheartedness', 'otherwise', 'stuffy', 'parties', 'duties', 'odd', 'twist', 'Sunny', 'was', 'unknowningly', 'promised', 'Emir', 'life', 'saved', 'wife', 'then', 'traded', 'exchange', 'military', 'supplies', 'loyalty', 'rather', 'quirky', 'movie', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'humor', 'obvious', 'fish', 'water', 'culture', 'class', 'conflict', 'etc', 'are', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'Sunny', 'American', 'gal', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'world', 'Indeed', 'when', 'brought', 'committee', 'investigate', 'goings', 'trade', 'Emir', 'out', 'saying', 'responsible', 'problems', 'bought', 'fame', 'fortune', 'glam', 'knowing', 'what', 'was', 'getting', 'never', 'read', 'paper', 'never', 'read', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'taking', 'visiting', 'dignitaries', 'see', 'never', 'watched', 'news', 'was', ""n't"", 'concerned', 'things', 'once', 'was', 'thrust', 'middle', 'suddenly', 'was', 'How', 'many', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'situation', 'Very', 'few', 'do', 'owe', 'ourselves', 'be', 'more', 'informed', 'see', 'forest', 'trees', 'Perhaps', 'example', 'will', 'serve', 'change']",Protocol
450960,ADKKDZGDVEVWZ,6305133425,NHMovieLover,"[0, 0]",Protocol is a light and airy comedy that I always found hysterical and fun. Goldie Hawn was at her best when she played these sort of characters. Her facial expressions and mousy voice added to the humor. You just cant help but love the woman for her comedic genius. Here she plays sunny Davis and average woman living in Washington working as a waitress. One night while heading home she witnesses an attempted assassination and without hesitation she brings down the culprits but ends up shot in the butt. She becomes a huge American sensation and ends up with a job within the government. Soon she realizes she was pimped out to the King for some military contract and it all comes to the surface with such humor.
