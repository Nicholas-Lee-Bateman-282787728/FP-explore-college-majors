1259744,A23P6AYU57RLO,B002BIULP8,"Bob Drake ""BobDrake""","[2, 2]","Note that this is a Region B blu-ray disc with the U.K. title ""Newcastle Australia"" and with extras in the PAL format. It will not play on Region A U.S. blu-ray machines, and the PAL extras are 50Hz which presents an additional obstacle for U.S. TV panels, many of which will not accept anything but a 60Hz signal. I have a machine that will play Region B and PAL discs while outputting a 60Hz signal.This film was shot on Super 16 (mainly because it is a common format for underwater surfing shots) and looks great on this blu-ray disc.In the U.S. and the U.K. Newcastle is marketed as a gay film. It is and it isn't. The teen surfer boys spend a lot of time in board shorts or less and make nice, blue-eyed, eye candy. The opening shot of Jesse, on a top bunk, opening his blue eyes to look out at the surf, is captivating. Then there is his darker, fraternal twin, Fergus (Xavier Samuels), who is a goth, gay kid with a streak of color in his hair. The cover of the U.K. release has Fergus/Xavier front and center, with a note that he is to appear inThe Twilight Saga: Eclipse (Two-Disc Special Edition). In truth, Xavier as vampire Riley in Eclipse is very different from Xavier the gay, meek Fergus of Newcastle.There is a lot of surf in the film, a lot of dysfunctional family dynamics involving Jesse's older brother who was a better surfer but did not handle the transition to adulthood well, and a lot of teen angst. When the boys and a couple of girls take off for a weekend in the dunes we see some naked boy butts and watch Jesse lose his virginity up close. It is clear that Fergus has a crush on Jesse's friend Andy. When, as odd men out, they pair up that evening, Fergus and Andy progress from stargazing to views on homosexuality to talk of masturbation. Eventually the older brother shows up with friends and ruins the beach party. (And the water changes in color from turquoise to steely blue - on purpose as we learn in the extras.)A lot has been made of the Fergus-Andy ""gay"" relationship. The gay director, Dan Castle, reportedly did not specifically see them as a gay couple, but had the two guys room together to bond, and told ""Andy"" to take the gay notion as far as he was comfortable. Australian men are not as chronically homophobic as are U.S. men, hencePuppetry of the Penis: The Ancient Art of Genital Origami. Level-headed Andy is one of the few who do not make jokes (""Fagus"") about Fergus. True, after the accepting Andy gives Fergus permission to ""look"" the two become close. And, since both are shown buckling up as if they had been up to something, perhaps VERY close. But why not, since Fergus has no other friends and Andy is accepting of Fergus. At one point towards the end of the film Andy is referred to as Fergus's ""boyfriend,"" but it is clear that this is said in a friendly, loving way among friends. So I guess if you must consider Fergus and Andy to be a couple, by all means do. I doubt director Castle, will argue with you, since there is a market for fresh gay films.The film ends with the two brothers, Jesse and Fergus, swimming naked together at a beach that is not clothing optional. It is clear that they are completely comfortable with each other's nudity as they swim like dolphins around an underwater camera in sun-dappled water, and as they run naked through the neighborhood back to their granddad's place. (A deft hand on the controls show they really are running naked if that is your thing.) Of course Xavier Samuels is not gay. Fergus is.The Extras are worthwhile since they discuss the filming and the music. (One actor proved to be a talented musician as well.)

1259745,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B002BIULP8,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[8, 10]","Surfing seems to be the sport of choice for most young men in ""Newcastle"" (Australia, 2008), a community on the coast of Australia.  17 year old Jesse is turning into a championship surfer, which turns up the resentment from his older brother Victor, a former competitive surfer whose wins were cut short by an injury.  Then there's Jesse's twin brother, Fergus, who is kidded royally by his siblings and their friends for not being particularly athletic, and for having a repressed but obvious crush on Jesse's best friend, Andy.Jesse and Fergus (along with their friends, including Jesse's girlfriend and another girl) take a weekend trip to desolate area of the coast to smoke pot, drink and surf.  All goes well until Victor and his friends show up, resulting in a reckless surf challenge ending in tragedy.This is not really a ""gay film"" at all, despite its presence at gay film festivals and heavy promotion in gay media. The characters of Fergus (who is kidded ruthlessly but good naturedly by his friends about his apparent crush on Andy) and one other minor gay role (the boys' grandfather, used more for comic relief) aren't developed even to the point where their homosexuality is fact rather than rumor, and don't add much to the overall story.  The acting is adequate, with no performance really noteworthy. The ""coming of age in a dysfunctional family"" plot is simplistic, which I am thankful for, since it was often difficult for me to understand the dialogue under some rather thick Aussie accents (the latter, of course, is my problem, and doesn't affect the rating).  However, what ""Newcastle"" is, more than anything else, is an exceptionally well photographed film that will stand up to any classic ""surf film"" for its beauty and breathtaking action scenes.  A bonus with the great photography: more than enough ""eye candy"" to keep gay viewers tuned in.  Some partial (rear) nudity, sexual situations, likely would be a light ""R"" if rated for USA viewership.The DVD includes a ""Making of"" featurette as well as director commentary.  I give this film three stars (out of five) overall, which includes an extra simply for the photography/eye candy.",3,"Kind of simplistic story, but exceptionally beautiful film.",1250208000,"08 14, 2009",2009,2165,"['Surfing', 'be', 'sport', 'choice', 'most', 'young', 'men', 'Newcastle', 'Australia', '2008', 'community', 'coast', 'Australia', '17', 'year', 'old', 'Jesse', 'turning', 'championship', 'surfer', 'up', 'resentment', 'older', 'brother', 'Victor', 'former', 'competitive', 'surfer', 'wins', 'were', 'cut', 'short', 'injury', 'Then', 'Jesse', 'twin', 'brother', 'Fergus', 'who', 'kidded', 'royally', 'siblings', 'friends', 'not', 'being', 'particularly', 'athletic', 'having', 'repressed', 'obvious', 'crush', 'Jesse', 'best', 'friend', 'Andy.Jesse', 'Fergus', 'friends', 'including', 'Jesse', 'girlfriend', 'girl', 'take', 'weekend', 'trip', 'desolate', 'area', 'coast', 'smoke', 'pot', 'drink', 'surf', 'well', 'Victor', 'friends', 'show', 'up', 'resulting', 'reckless', 'surf', 'challenge', 'ending', 'tragedy.This', 'not', 'really', 'gay', 'film', 'presence', 'gay', 'film', 'festivals', 'heavy', 'promotion', 'gay', 'media', 'characters', 'Fergus', 'who', 'kidded', 'ruthlessly', 'good', 'naturedly', 'friends', 'apparent', 'crush', 'Andy', 'one', 'other', 'minor', 'gay', 'role', 'boys', 'grandfather', 'used', 'more', 'comic', 'relief', 'are', ""n't"", 'developed', 'even', 'point', 'where', 'homosexuality', 'fact', 'rather', 'rumor', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'overall', 'story', 'acting', 'adequate', 'performance', 'really', 'noteworthy', 'coming', 'age', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'plot', 'simplistic', 'am', 'thankful', 'was', 'often', 'difficult', 'understand', 'dialogue', 'rather', 'thick', 'Aussie', 'accents', 'latter', 'course', 'problem', ""n't"", 'affect', 'rating', 'However', 'what', 'Newcastle', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'photographed', 'film', 'will', 'stand', 'up', 'classic', 'surf', 'film', 'beauty', 'breathtaking', 'action', 'scenes', 'bonus', 'great', 'photography', 'more', 'enough', 'eye', 'candy', 'keep', 'gay', 'viewers', 'tuned', 'partial', 'rear', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'situations', 'likely', 'would', 'be', 'light', 'R', 'rated', 'USA', 'viewership.The', 'DVD', 'Making', 'featurette', 'as', 'well', 'director', 'commentary', 'give', 'film', 'three', 'stars', 'five', 'overall', 'extra', 'simply', 'photography/eye', 'candy']",N/A

Full of very pretty people, lots of skin and sun and sand and deep blue water, it's reminiscent of ""Endless Summer"".  The young, unknown Aussie actors are fun and since they were chosen for their surfing skills first, they're clearly comfortable on their boards.However, why this film is touted / marketed as an LGBT friendly picture is beyond me.  Jesse's brother Fergus (referred to by Jesse's friends as ""Fagus"") is an allegedly gay character, but beyond a little almost-snuggle with Andy and some innocent banter about them both liking stars and astronomy, you'll never know for sure.  The ""gay"" subplot in this film is beyond vapor thin and Fergus is stereotypically played as a shy, embarrassed goth-ish kid with black fingernails and constantly living in the shadow of his two very straight brothers.  The main themes and scenes in the story are all about the straight boys and girls and, of course, the surfing.The movie's not all that bad.  It's reasonably well written and fairly well acted. The cinematography is terrific - particularly the water and surf footage.

The setting is around the busy titular port city about a hundred miles up the coast north of Sydney, Australia.  Most of the characters compete and relate through surfing, but this is not at heart a surfing movie.Despite appearances, the central character is the older brother, Victor Hoff (Reshad Strick), an embittered former surfing champion.  When he injured his knee, he very assertively insisted his younger, twin step-brothers, Jesse (Lachlan Buchanan) and Fergus (Xavier Samuel), were not good enough to follow in his footsteps.  Jesse was determined to show up Victor.  Victor kept Fergus out of surfing altogether because Fergus needed glasses and was considered to be gay.  Their longshoreman father, Reggie Hoff (Shane Jacobson) and the twins' mother, Flora Hoff (Joy Smithers), bought in on Victor's premise and were not demonstrably supportive of Jesse's competing or of Fergus' even learning about surfing.  The father is shown counseling Victor or protecting the twins from Victor's physical intimidation but not trying to counsel the twins.  Jesse buys into Victor's views of Fergus.  Victor dominates.Jesse's resentments cause him to compete too aggressively and unsafely.  When things go wrong, he lashes out at his friends, Andy (Kirk Jenkins), Scotty (Israel Canaan), and Nathan (Ben Milliken).  On a trip to the Stockton Dunes near Newcastle, Andy starts to teach Nathan how to surf, much to the disgust of Jesse.  Just as Nathan starts having some success, Victor shows up with two tough surfer pals.  As the going gets more competitive, the surf gets rougher too.  When Victor takes the initiative to get Nathan out of harm's way, Jesse's hostile surfing and the rising waves make overwhelming trouble for Victor and Andy.With Victor gone, the Hoff family has to recover from years of abuse.  Bewildered Jesse has lost his reason for surfing.  It takes a night conversation at the top of a sharktower with Fergus to get Jesse remotivated and a discrete nude romp in the surf with Fergus for the brothers to bond.  The father does not give himself permission to watch Jesse compete until the father discovers that Victor kept newspaper clippings of Jesse's successes hidden away in Victor's trophies.  With the removal of a powerful, controlling personality, each of the rest of the family could find a path to a fuller life and more supportive family relationships.The extras are a commentary track by the director and crew, three trailers, a making-of, four Wolfe previews, and a contest entry.  All the surfers show lots of skin, there is a night with sex with two girl friends and within a budding gay relationship.  The soundtrack is very good, the acting is good enough, and most viewers should enjoy the film.",3,Spectacular Australian Surfing Setting for Family Dynamics,1258761600,"11 21, 2009",2009,2848,"['Newcastle', 'most', 'immediate', 'apparent', 'strengths', 'are', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'looks', 'actors', 'setting', 'busy', 'titular', 'port', 'city', 'hundred', 'miles', 'coast', 'north', 'Sydney', 'Australia', 'Most', 'characters', 'compete', 'relate', 'surfing', 'not', 'heart', 'surfing', 'movie.Despite', 'appearances', 'central', 'character', 'older', 'brother', 'Victor', 'Hoff', 'Reshad', 'Strick', 'embittered', 'former', 'surfing', 'champion', 'When', 'injured', 'knee', 'very', 'assertively', 'insisted', 'younger', 'twin', 'step-brothers', 'Jesse', 'Lachlan', 'Buchanan', 'Fergus', 'Xavier', 'Samuel', 'were', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'Jesse', 'was', 'determined', 'show', 'up', 'Victor', 'Victor', 'kept', 'Fergus', 'surfing', 'altogether', 'Fergus', 'needed', 'glasses', 'was', 'considered', 'be', 'gay', 'longshoreman', 'father', 'Reggie', 'Hoff', 'Shane', 'Jacobson', 'twins', 'mother', 'Flora', 'Hoff', 'Joy', 'Smithers', 'bought', 'Victor', 'premise', 'were', 'not', 'demonstrably', 'supportive', 'Jesse', 'competing', 'Fergus', 'even', 'learning', 'surfing', 'father', 'shown', 'counseling', 'Victor', 'protecting', 'twins', 'Victor', 'physical', 'intimidation', 'not', 'trying', 'counsel', 'twins', 'Jesse', 'Victor', 'views', 'Fergus', 'Victor', 'dominates.Jesse', 'resentments', 'cause', 'compete', 'too', 'aggressively', 'unsafely', 'When', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'out', 'friends', 'Andy', 'Kirk', 'Jenkins', 'Scotty', 'Israel', 'Canaan', 'Nathan', 'Ben', 'Milliken', 'trip', 'Stockton', 'Dunes', 'Newcastle', 'Andy', 'teach', 'Nathan', 'how', 'surf', 'much', 'disgust', 'Jesse', 'Just', 'Nathan', 'having', 'success', 'Victor', 'up', 'two', 'tough', 'surfer', 'pals', 'going', 'more', 'competitive', 'surf', 'rougher', 'too', 'When', 'Victor', 'initiative', 'get', 'Nathan', 'harm', 'way', 'Jesse', 'hostile', 'surfing', 'rising', 'waves', 'make', 'overwhelming', 'trouble', 'Victor', 'Andy.With', 'Victor', 'gone', 'Hoff', 'family', 'recover', 'years', 'abuse', 'Bewildered', 'Jesse', 'lost', 'reason', 'surfing', 'night', 'conversation', 'top', 'sharktower', 'Fergus', 'get', 'Jesse', 'remotivated', 'discrete', 'nude', 'romp', 'surf', 'Fergus', 'brothers', 'bond', 'father', 'not', 'give', 'permission', 'watch', 'Jesse', 'compete', 'father', 'Victor', 'kept', 'newspaper', 'clippings', 'Jesse', 'successes', 'hidden', 'away', 'Victor', 'trophies', 'removal', 'powerful', 'controlling', 'personality', 'rest', 'family', 'could', 'find', 'path', 'fuller', 'life', 'more', 'supportive', 'family', 'relationships.The', 'extras', 'are', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'crew', 'three', 'trailers', 'making-of', 'four', 'Wolfe', 'previews', 'contest', 'entry', 'surfers', 'show', 'lots', 'skin', 'night', 'sex', 'two', 'girl', 'friends', 'budding', 'gay', 'relationship', 'soundtrack', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'good', 'enough', 'most', 'viewers', 'should', 'enjoy', 'film']",N/A
1259755,A25R2VZXZ5X6Y3,B002BIULP8,larry-411,"[41, 45]","Once in a while a film comes along which tries to be bold, daring, and provocative while still retaining enough ""warm and fuzzy' to appeal to American audiences. The result is usually a self-indulgent train wreck that smacks of too many engineers in the locomotive. First time writer/director Dan Castle attempts it in ""Newcastle,"" and the result will leave audiences wide-eyed with amazement.The setting is a section of Australia flanked by the sound of heavy industry on one side and the crash of some of the best waves in the world on the other. It is here that a complex family drama is played out, with three brothers caught in a struggle for individual freedom and respect from each other. Older brother Victor has seen his championship surfing days come and go, so it's no wonder he harbors some resentment towards his 17-year-old brother Jesse, on the rise to becoming a champion himself. Jesse's twin brother Fergus throws everyone for a loop with his ever-changing hair color and enigmatic personality. Dad tries to hold it all together but, like any working class parent, struggles to find the time to even be present enough to make a difference. An assortment of surfer guys and gals adds even more peer pressure, and what starts out as a beach outing becomes a defining moment for everyone.That said, ""Newcastle"" is anything but a film about surfing. Yes, it was a requirement that the actors be able to surf, but most young Australians do anyway. So casting was not a problem. And it's this brilliant ensemble cast that makes the multi-layered narrative work so well. Themes of parental responsibility, sibling rivalry, and unspoken sexuality revolve around a gritty coming-of-age story which, ultimately, is really more about brotherly love than anything else.The story's true focus is on the relationships among the young men, specifically the two younger brothers and their feelings towards each other, their parents, their mates, and their girls, or guys, as the case may be. It's always hard to single anyone out in an ensemble cast but this film touches the heart more than anything by the performances of Lachlan Buchanan and Xavier Samuel as Jesse and Fergus. Their relationship is both heartening and heartbreaking in turn, and it only works because the on screen chemistry is so palpable. Their commanding presence says that these guys have a bright future in cinema. Reshad Strik is riveting as the tortured older brother and Shane Jacobson shines as the father who is the antithesis of the typical American movie's working class brute of a dad - this guy has the heart of an ox. Kirk Jenkins (Andy), Ben Milliken (Nathan), and Israel Cannan (Scotty) are the core of the surfer mates - Cannan provides much of the film's comic relief (and contributes several songs to the soundtrack). All add nuances and layers to their characters which surface when one least expects it.Production values belie the film's modest budget, with the polished look of a Hollywood movie from the first to last breaking wave. The soundtrack is killer, an absolute requirement for any film featuring competitive sports. Most of all, though, the cinematography is breathtaking. Richard Michalak's shots of surfers riding the waves, with his camera looking up from the ocean floor, had me shaking my head with wonder. It was like nothing I'd ever seen. I avoid spoilers at any cost but I feel confident in saying that there are several scenes which will bring tears to your eyes. ""Newcastle"" sets a new standard for underwater photography.Various elements in the film, taken individually, aren't necessarily anything we haven't seen before. But it's the way Castle integrates them and the lengths to which he is willing to take them which makes ""Newcastle"" so refreshing. There is some content which may be too uncomfortable for theatergoers who have issues with male nudity and sexuality. Some scenes will likely have young guys squirming in their seats, but perhaps America has progressed to the point that we can appreciate a film which dares to be different.With ""Newcastle,"" Dan Castle pushes the boundaries of the typical American coming-of-age slash sports competition film (in this case, surfing). Perhaps he can do it because it is not, in fact, an American film at all but hails from Australia. Perhaps he can get away with it because it wasn't churned out by a Hollywood studio and didn't have the hand of the usual producers and distributors whose financing would undoubtedly come with strings attached. Or perhaps it's just because he had a vision and the tenacity to surround himself with others who wouldn't compromise. In the end, nothing is as it seems at first glance.

As it is, or near as one can tell, there are a bunch of dudes who are a-holes to each other 24/7; there's some nice--but definitely nothing like award-winning--surf footage; a handful of surf chicks whose dramatic purpose is solely to service the dudes' physical needs; and no matter how mediocre the movie, some people can always be relied upon to always bestow a minimum of four stars for anything showing some bare bubble butts running into the ocean, of which ""Newcastle"" has a marginally above average quota.  Near as I can tell, the guys in this flick are all half-wit jerk-offs going nowhere fast (except for the ""sensitive,"" probably queer one, who is a wuss, but--spoiler alert!--in the flick's very best moment, the wuss actually catches a wave and stands up on his board!).Clearly, the film's point is that these perfectly tanned dudes are never going to be much of anything more than meat-head losers as a consequence of:(a.) Australia's extreme endemic alcoholism (pretty much a given in any movie about Aussie dysfunction); or(b.) the compound sociological and economic pressures of their under-privileged, industrial-adjacent environment; and/or possibly(c.) a chronic shortage of appropriately charismatic mentors and/or role models to inspire realistic life goals beyond winning the next local surfing competition.What? A surf flick with a heavy social conscience? Uh, no thanks. I'd suggest you give that concept a miss and watch virtually any real surf movie instead.  The inequities of the capitalist system and the ecstasies of surfing do not make for particularly synergistic narrative themes.

The ocean became a much less friendly place and this film shows the consequences of this kind of attitude while in the grips of nature.

This is quite testosterone fuelled but most of it is aimed towards competitive surfing, or arguing or making a lot of unnecessary noise and aggression. There is scant character development which I found disappointing.Of the three brothers the middle on Jessie is trying to emulate his older brother's surf achievements. His elder brother was a success but has now faded into obscurity as not enough time in the classroom has led him to be a bit of a failure in the `real world'. He still lives at home as his relationship with his ex has broken down. The younger brother Fergus (Xavier Samuel) is gay and a goth and has no friends.He gets invited to join Jessie and his friends for a weekend surf party up the coast, and that is where it gets interesting. Please note this is not a sex fest, it does have some mild nudity but as a 15 cert you can guess that this is fairly tame.As I said not enough character development, but some very nice shots and if you are into surfing, then this is a must, I actually preferred `Tan Lines', but this is still an above average film and did not drag in the least, so for some light entertainment with eye candy a plenty this should `float your boat' or at least your boogie board.",3,Nice film that could have been better,1304640000,"05 6, 2011",2011,1599,"['film', 'gay', 'director', 'Dan', 'Castle', 'been', 'advertised', 'gay', 'movie', 'being', 'promoted', 'Peccadillo', 'U.K.', 'Up', 'front', 'not', 'gay', 'film', 'one', 'real', 'gay', 'character', 'lot', 'cutsie', 'eye', 'candy', 'shots', 'buff', 'boys', 'board', 'about', 'relationship', 'family', 'three', 'brothers', 'pains', 'growing', 'up', 'endless', 'surfing', 'quite', 'testosterone', 'fuelled', 'most', 'aimed', 'towards', 'competitive', 'surfing', 'arguing', 'making', 'lot', 'unnecessary', 'noise', 'aggression', 'scant', 'character', 'development', 'found', 'disappointing.Of', 'three', 'brothers', 'middle', 'Jessie', 'trying', 'emulate', 'older', 'brother', 'surf', 'achievements', 'elder', 'brother', 'was', 'success', 'now', 'faded', 'obscurity', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'classroom', 'led', 'be', 'bit', 'failure', 'real', 'world', 'still', 'home', 'relationship', 'ex', 'broken', 'down', 'younger', 'brother', 'Fergus', 'Xavier', 'Samuel', 'gay', 'goth', 'friends.He', 'invited', 'join', 'Jessie', 'friends', 'weekend', 'surf', 'party', 'coast', 'where', 'interesting', 'Please', 'note', 'not', 'sex', 'fest', 'have', 'mild', 'nudity', '15', 'cert', 'can', 'guess', 'fairly', 'tame.As', 'said', 'not', 'enough', 'character', 'development', 'very', 'nice', 'shots', 'are', 'surfing', 'then', 'must', 'actually', 'preferred', 'Tan', 'Lines', 'still', 'above', 'average', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'drag', 'least', 'so', 'light', 'entertainment', 'eye', 'candy', 'plenty', 'should', 'float', 'boat', 'least', 'boogie', 'board']",N/A
