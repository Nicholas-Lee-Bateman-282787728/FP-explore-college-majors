This mini-series covers 200 years of history and it is the  length of the series that makes it so wonderful.  The viewer has time to  truly identify and grow with the characters.The story moves quickly  and holds the viewers attention.  I have watched 3 episodes at a time  without realizing that 4 hours had elapsed.  The acting was top notch.  The  stage sets and scenery look authentic. This series is as close to flawless as  it gets.  The only thing I did not like about the series was the way they  aged the actors hair as the characters got older.  It sometimes looks as  though the graying affect was achieved by sprinkling flour in the hair.  However, that is nitpicking. All in all it is a great piece of work that  other film makers will have a hard time surpassing.",5,"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!!!!",916099200,"01 12, 1999",1999,932,"['may', 'be', 'turned', 'off', '20', 'hour', 'mini', 'series', 'not', 'view', 'are', 'missing', 'one', 'best', 'pieces', 'film', 'work', 'ever', 'produced', 'mini-series', '200', 'years', 'history', 'length', 'series', 'so', 'wonderful', 'viewer', 'time', 'truly', 'identify', 'grow', 'characters.The', 'story', 'moves', 'quickly', 'viewers', 'attention', 'have', 'watched', '3', 'episodes', 'time', 'realizing', '4', 'hours', 'had', 'elapsed', 'acting', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'stage', 'sets', 'scenery', 'look', 'authentic', 'series', 'close', 'flawless', 'only', 'thing', 'did', 'not', 'series', 'was', 'way', 'aged', 'actors', 'hair', 'characters', 'got', 'older', 'sometimes', 'graying', 'affect', 'was', 'achieved', 'sprinkling', 'flour', 'hair', 'However', 'nitpicking', 'great', 'piece', 'work', 'other', 'film', 'makers', 'will', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'surpassing']",N/A
45757,ARXDDR76Z5Q2I,0783215126,A.J.,"[4, 4]","I'm not going to dwell on aspects of reviews already published here, but I do wish to take exception with a few things.  One reviewer stated that he thought only the first 5 parts, and the last, were worthy of consideration, but I disagree.  I found the entire series was outstanding.  Agreed that the first 5 parts, detailing the founding of the American west, and in particular the town of Centennial, are the best, and the last episode, which takes place in present day, is a fitting conclusion to the series, but I found the parts in between to be very good as well.  The series spans many years and couldn't stay in the old west for the entire journey.  These episodes dealt with many interesting storylines, including the dust storm in the 11th episode and its bloody aftermath.  The entire series is well worth watching, so don't give up after episode 5.I've also read a few people complaining that the mastering job could have been better, something I don't understand.  This dvd release is excellent, with crystal clear picture and beautiful color.  Perhaps this was the same master they used for the vhs release, but what's wrong with that?  The vhs release looked great.One more point.  I wish to give praise to one aspect of this wonderful show that never gets attention.  John Addison's majestic score.  It's a stunning work of art that perfectly compliments the production.Centennial was indeed remarkably ambitious, and stands the test of time to this day, with its message that we must take care of the land more timely than ever.  As James Michener says in the introduction, we are the guardians of the earth, the custodians of our heritage, and the caretakers of our future.",5,"Centennial, an outstanding mini-series.",1224374400,"10 19, 2008",2008,1692,"[""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'dwell', 'aspects', 'reviews', 'already', 'published', 'here', 'do', 'wish', 'take', 'exception', 'few', 'things', 'One', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'thought', 'only', 'first', '5', 'parts', 'last', 'were', 'worthy', 'consideration', 'disagree', 'found', 'entire', 'series', 'was', 'outstanding', 'Agreed', 'first', '5', 'parts', 'detailing', 'founding', 'American', 'west', 'particular', 'town', 'Centennial', 'are', 'best', 'last', 'episode', 'place', 'present', 'day', 'fitting', 'conclusion', 'series', 'found', 'parts', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'series', 'many', 'years', 'could', ""n't"", 'stay', 'old', 'west', 'entire', 'journey', 'episodes', 'dealt', 'many', 'interesting', 'storylines', 'including', 'dust', 'storm', '11th', 'episode', 'bloody', 'aftermath', 'entire', 'series', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'episode', '5.I', ""'ve"", 'also', 'read', 'few', 'people', 'complaining', 'mastering', 'job', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'dvd', 'release', 'excellent', 'crystal', 'clear', 'picture', 'beautiful', 'color', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'same', 'master', 'used', 'vhs', 'release', 'what', 'wrong', 'vhs', 'release', 'looked', 'great.One', 'more', 'point', 'wish', 'give', 'praise', 'one', 'aspect', 'wonderful', 'show', 'never', 'attention', 'John', 'Addison', 'majestic', 'score', 'stunning', 'work', 'art', 'perfectly', 'production.Centennial', 'was', 'indeed', 'remarkably', 'ambitious', 'test', 'time', 'day', 'message', 'must', 'take', 'care', 'land', 'more', 'timely', 'ever', 'James', 'Michener', 'introduction', 'are', 'guardians', 'earth', 'custodians', 'heritage', 'caretakers', 'future']",N/A
45758,A2L3BR7ED0DOKU,0783215126,"Amazon Customer ""Digee""","[2, 2]","Centennial is a worthwhile twenty-six hour journey through the history of the state of Colorado.  The six DVDs in this set run about four hours each.  I enjoyed the first five DVDs of the story, but DVD six dragged on and on.  The last episode was really boring in my opinion because it was focused on how America is ruining the planet through industry.  This episode was full of numerous flashbacks from prior episodes and really appeared very dated and too preachy towards environmentalism.  The first DVD is excellent.  This DVD has actors giving vibrant life to their unforgettable characters.  Some of the characters appear so real that I can imagine reading biographies and holding artifacts of these fictional beings.  It is nice to witness the birth of fictional characters who show up in later episodes as parents and grandparents.  Unlike a lot of the movies and shows I have watched, Centennial will remain in my long term memory because it really is memorable.  It is a story that contains true love, beauty, tragedy, evil, ugliness, violence, goodness, and history.  As a teacher, I hope to use a few scenes within this film to illustrate historical concepts to history students.  Centennial is an excellent value because it contains twenty-six hours of entertainment in a nice package and currently runs less than $23 on Amazon.",5,Memorable and Historical Televison,1249257600,"08 3, 2009",2009,1342,"['Centennial', 'worthwhile', 'twenty-six', 'hour', 'journey', 'history', 'state', 'Colorado', 'six', 'DVDs', 'set', 'run', 'four', 'hours', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'five', 'DVDs', 'story', 'DVD', 'six', 'dragged', 'last', 'episode', 'was', 'really', 'boring', 'opinion', 'was', 'focused', 'how', 'America', 'ruining', 'planet', 'industry', 'episode', 'was', 'full', 'numerous', 'flashbacks', 'prior', 'episodes', 'really', 'appeared', 'very', 'dated', 'too', 'preachy', 'towards', 'environmentalism', 'first', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'actors', 'giving', 'vibrant', 'life', 'unforgettable', 'characters', 'characters', 'appear', 'so', 'real', 'can', 'imagine', 'reading', 'biographies', 'holding', 'artifacts', 'fictional', 'beings', 'nice', 'witness', 'birth', 'fictional', 'characters', 'who', 'show', 'up', 'later', 'episodes', 'parents', 'grandparents', 'lot', 'movies', 'shows', 'have', 'watched', 'Centennial', 'will', 'remain', 'long', 'term', 'memory', 'really', 'memorable', 'story', 'true', 'love', 'beauty', 'tragedy', 'evil', 'ugliness', 'violence', 'goodness', 'history', 'teacher', 'hope', 'use', 'few', 'scenes', 'film', 'illustrate', 'historical', 'concepts', 'history', 'students', 'Centennial', 'excellent', 'value', 'twenty-six', 'hours', 'entertainment', 'nice', 'package', 'currently', 'less', '23', 'Amazon']",N/A

45764,A3BHHITNNA5R5B,0783215126,"bagpiper8 ""Mark""","[4, 5]","Wow. That's about all I can say when I remember being 11 years old and seeing the movie trucks move into our small farming community of Weldon Valley here in Northeast Colorado. I can remember my uncle and kids from my school telling me about their bit parts, standing in the background in scenes (and also for those lucky kids--missing school to be in the school teacher scene at one point in the series! Those bums!). For a long time the town of Orchard remained a stark reminder of what happens when something out of the ordinary happens in small communities and then it is over: it's all we had to talk about for years! As a kid how many times did my brother and I go out to the corn fields to play ""McCeeg and Paskinel"" with BB guns in town and fake coon skin caps bought from our vacation to the Alamo that past summer?! Imaginary foes, stories, and a new love of the bagpipes and mountain life were seen in a way I never thought of before as we recreated the Rendevous every weekend afternoon in the hayfield next to the house (remember that scene?) When I went to college I still got attention from the fact I grew up where this was filmed, and took photos of the quickly failing sets (now 10 years older), complete with foam fake brick siding falling off everytwhere and other momentos where folks nabbed ""Centennial lumber"" left from sets to build this and that. My favorite memory: walking down the street of ""Centennial"" to find Brian Keith relaxing in the shade on the side porch of the general store. We got our pictures with the man, it was a moment I won't forget, he was cordial but not overtly friendly (he was big-time tired from the heat of the day), but he stood there stoic-ally while snapshot after snapshot was taken, putting up with us like pesky flies on a hot day. Oh, and I also remember the scenes north of the school where the great Indian (Native American) battles were shot--(we DID get out of school to go see that done), the teepees out in the pasture were one of those times when you felt like you might be looking into a time machine window, it was so beautifully and wonderfully done. When I grew up and left college, the first coat I bought myself with my own money I earned from my new job was (of course) a leather jacket with the fringe all over it, and I also just HAD TO HAVE a burly muzzle loader from Cabelas (that has never shot anything except targets on the trees to the north of my home--mighty white hunter I am). Besides how the films affected me growing up, the thing about Centennial too was that it was honest, (if not a bit hokey once in a while--too many people seemed to die under dramatic circumstances when you watch the shows back to back!). Overall I felt it hoped not just to entertain but to envisage a reality of days gone by--and to show that the ""good ole days"" were not always that good. Thanks for reading my ""blog"" here, that being said--I hope you buy the series and take it for what it was worth from the standpoint of being a great western tale based in reality by Michener (Centennial the town is very much a story about Greeley, Colorado and other towns in Northeast Colorado) and by being a monolith project of the late 70's that was not soon forgotten. This was especially true of how the series really had an impact on a young farm boy/college kid/& pastor (ME) who came to love the history of where he grew up so much--he returned and ended up living in the same little community he grew up in. I may live in what big city folk call ""podunk USA"" or the ""boondocks"", but Centennial and movies like it make a person feel that it is sometimes the most insignificant places in the world that have the greatest stories to tell. And that makes me proud to live here, and it also makes me want to share Centennial's great story by viewing the series with my own kids and generations to come.",5,I literally grew up with Centennial--and now it can be here again!,1210291200,"05 9, 2008",2008,3862,"['Wow', 'can', 'say', 'when', 'remember', 'being', '11', 'years', 'old', 'seeing', 'movie', 'trucks', 'move', 'small', 'farming', 'community', 'Weldon', 'Valley', 'here', 'Northeast', 'Colorado', 'can', 'remember', 'uncle', 'kids', 'school', 'telling', 'bit', 'parts', 'standing', 'background', 'scenes', 'also', 'lucky', 'kids', 'missing', 'school', 'be', 'school', 'teacher', 'scene', 'one', 'point', 'series', 'bums', 'long', 'time', 'town', 'Orchard', 'remained', 'stark', 'reminder', 'what', 'when', 'something', 'ordinary', 'happens', 'small', 'communities', 'then', 'had', 'talk', 'years', 'kid', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'did', 'brother', 'go', 'out', 'corn', 'fields', 'play', 'McCeeg', 'Paskinel', 'BB', 'guns', 'town', 'fake', 'coon', 'skin', 'caps', 'bought', 'vacation', 'Alamo', 'past', 'summer', 'Imaginary', 'foes', 'stories', 'new', 'love', 'bagpipes', 'mountain', 'life', 'were', 'seen', 'way', 'never', 'thought', 'recreated', 'Rendevous', 'weekend', 'afternoon', 'hayfield', 'next', 'house', 'remember', 'scene', 'When', 'went', 'college', 'still', 'got', 'attention', 'fact', 'grew', 'up', 'where', 'was', 'filmed', 'took', 'photos', 'quickly', 'failing', 'sets', 'now', '10', 'years', 'older', 'complete', 'foam', 'fake', 'brick', 'siding', 'falling', 'off', 'everytwhere', 'other', 'momentos', 'where', 'folks', 'Centennial', 'lumber', 'left', 'sets', 'build', 'favorite', 'memory', 'walking', 'down', 'street', 'Centennial', 'find', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'relaxing', 'shade', 'side', 'porch', 'general', 'store', 'got', 'pictures', 'man', 'was', 'moment', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget', 'was', 'cordial', 'not', 'overtly', 'friendly', 'was', 'big-time', 'tired', 'heat', 'day', 'stood', 'stoic-ally', 'snapshot', 'snapshot', 'was', 'taken', 'putting', 'up', 'pesky', 'flies', 'hot', 'day', 'Oh', 'also', 'remember', 'scenes', 'north', 'school', 'where', 'great', 'Indian', 'Native', 'American', 'battles', 'were', 'shot', 'DID', 'get', 'school', 'go', 'see', 'done', 'teepees', 'out', 'pasture', 'were', 'one', 'times', 'when', 'felt', 'might', 'be', 'looking', 'time', 'machine', 'window', 'was', 'so', 'beautifully', 'wonderfully', 'done', 'When', 'grew', 'up', 'left', 'college', 'first', 'coat', 'bought', 'own', 'money', 'earned', 'new', 'job', 'was', 'course', 'leather', 'jacket', 'fringe', 'also', 'just', 'HAD', 'TO', 'HAVE', 'burly', 'muzzle', 'loader', 'Cabelas', 'never', 'shot', 'anything', 'targets', 'trees', 'north', 'home', 'mighty', 'white', 'hunter', 'am', 'how', 'films', 'affected', 'growing', 'up', 'thing', 'Centennial', 'too', 'was', 'was', 'honest', 'not', 'bit', 'hokey', 'once', 'while', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'seemed', 'die', 'dramatic', 'circumstances', 'when', 'watch', 'shows', 'back', 'back', 'Overall', 'felt', 'hoped', 'not', 'just', 'entertain', 'envisage', 'reality', 'days', 'gone', 'show', 'good', 'ole', 'days', 'were', 'not', 'always', 'good', 'Thanks', 'reading', 'blog', 'here', 'being', 'said', 'hope', 'buy', 'series', 'take', 'what', 'was', 'worth', 'standpoint', 'being', 'great', 'western', 'tale', 'based', 'reality', 'Michener', 'Centennial', 'town', 'very', 'much', 'story', 'Greeley', 'Colorado', 'other', 'towns', 'Northeast', 'Colorado', 'being', 'monolith', 'project', 'late', '70', 'was', 'not', 'soon', 'forgotten', 'was', 'especially', 'true', 'how', 'series', 'really', 'had', 'impact', 'young', 'farm', 'boy/college', 'kid/', 'pastor', 'ME', 'who', 'came', 'love', 'history', 'where', 'grew', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'returned', 'ended', 'up', 'living', 'same', 'little', 'community', 'grew', 'up', 'may', 'live', 'what', 'big', 'city', 'folk', 'call', 'podunk', 'USA', 'boondocks', 'Centennial', 'movies', 'make', 'person', 'feel', 'sometimes', 'most', 'insignificant', 'places', 'world', 'have', 'greatest', 'stories', 'tell', 'proud', 'live', 'here', 'also', 'want', 'share', 'Centennial', 'great', 'story', 'viewing', 'series', 'own', 'kids', 'generations', 'come']",N/A
45765,ANGH6401L9Y0T,0783215126,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[2, 2]","I don't normally review the TV shows I have on DVD, but this is an exception. For one thing, it's a single continuous story, rather like an extremely long movie. Also, I never saw it when it was on TV, but heard that a lot of people thought it was excellent.It certainly had its share of stars. Just look at this list: Robert Conrad, Richard Chamberlain, Raymond Burr, Sally Kellerman, Barbara Carrera, Gregory Harrison, Stephanie Zimbalist, Richard Crenna, Alex Karras, Dennis Weaver, Timothy Dalton, Brian Keith, Lynn Redgrave, David Janssen, Robert Vaughn, Andy Griffith, Merle Haggard. There's a lot more; those are just the names I recognize.The story is one of James A. Michener's best. It chronicles the origins of the town of Centennial, Colorado, although the movie is half over before it even gets that name. The first white man in the region was Quebec trapper Pasquinel (Robert Conrad). He rescued Alexander McKeag from some Arapaho who released him into Pasquinel's custody because they trusted him. He became Pasquinel's partner in several senses of the word. They were trappers and traders together, but they also loved the same two women: Pasquinel's lovely German wife (Sally Kellerman) in St. Louis, and his even more lovely Native American wife. McKeag, being a complete gentleman, waits until after Pasquinel is dead to marry his wife Clay Basket (Barbara Carrera).Levi Zandt, a young Mennonite, was shunned by the community for something that was not his fault. So he called away an orphan named Ellie, who bravely headed west with him. When they turn back because of an attempted rape of Ellie, they meet McKeag, who wants them to start a second trading post somewhat south of the fort in which he has set up. He and Clay Basket have a beautiful daughter, young enough to be of comfort to Levi when Ellie is killed by a rattlesnake bite.No, I'm not going to detail all the long series. There are fights with the Natives, and with an insane militia man named Schimmelhorn (who I believe was a historical character). There's a huge cattle drive to bring stock from Texas to Colorado to start a huge ranch founded by Oliver Seccombe, an Englishman who originally came west to write a book, and fell in love with the land. Then sheep are brought in, and we have the classic ""cattlemen vs. shepherd"" story. Also the farmers start taking up land. There's a couple and their son, actors, who come to town and cause nothing but trouble. There are various sorts of shoot-outs, a killer blizzard, dust storms to cause a good wife to go mad, and finally, a jerk who takes hunters up in helicopters so they can shoot bald eagles.It's quite a story; all of it. I don't know how to assign stars, for a variety of reasons. One reason is the extent to which early footage is used as flash-backs when someone is telling a story of the past. Bad enough the same segments are used several times, but when one segment (the Schimmelhorn Massacre) is used twice in a single episode, that was going too far. I understand that my seeing it like this, all at once, is not the same as someone viewing an episode a week, but twice in a single episode just doesn't seem right.I enjoyed this movie, I loved seeing the incredible scenery and all those top actors, and the story is one that has James Michener behind it.",4,Engrossing Historical Drama,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,3311,"['do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'review', 'TV', 'shows', 'have', 'DVD', 'exception', 'one', 'thing', 'single', 'continuous', 'story', 'rather', 'extremely', 'long', 'movie', 'Also', 'never', 'saw', 'when', 'was', 'TV', 'heard', 'lot', 'people', 'thought', 'was', 'excellent.It', 'certainly', 'had', 'share', 'stars', 'Just', 'look', 'list', 'Robert', 'Conrad', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'Sally', 'Kellerman', 'Barbara', 'Carrera', 'Gregory', 'Harrison', 'Stephanie', 'Zimbalist', 'Richard', 'Crenna', 'Alex', 'Karras', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'David', 'Janssen', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Merle', 'Haggard', 'lot', 'more', 'are', 'just', 'names', 'recognize.The', 'story', 'one', 'James', 'A.', 'Michener', 'best', 'origins', 'town', 'Centennial', 'Colorado', 'movie', 'half', 'even', 'name', 'first', 'white', 'man', 'region', 'was', 'Quebec', 'Pasquinel', 'Robert', 'Conrad', 'rescued', 'Alexander', 'McKeag', 'Arapaho', 'who', 'released', 'Pasquinel', 'custody', 'trusted', 'became', 'Pasquinel', 'partner', 'several', 'senses', 'word', 'were', 'trappers', 'traders', 'together', 'also', 'loved', 'same', 'two', 'women', 'Pasquinel', 'lovely', 'German', 'wife', 'Sally', 'Kellerman', 'St.', 'Louis', 'even', 'more', 'lovely', 'Native', 'American', 'wife', 'McKeag', 'being', 'complete', 'gentleman', 'waits', 'Pasquinel', 'dead', 'marry', 'wife', 'Clay', 'Basket', 'Barbara', 'Carrera', '.Levi', 'Zandt', 'young', 'Mennonite', 'was', 'shunned', 'community', 'something', 'was', 'not', 'fault', 'called', 'away', 'orphan', 'named', 'Ellie', 'who', 'bravely', 'headed', 'west', 'When', 'turn', 'back', 'attempted', 'rape', 'Ellie', 'meet', 'McKeag', 'who', 'start', 'second', 'trading', 'post', 'somewhat', 'fort', 'set', 'up', 'Clay', 'Basket', 'have', 'beautiful', 'daughter', 'young', 'enough', 'be', 'comfort', 'Levi', 'when', 'Ellie', 'killed', 'rattlesnake', 'bite.No', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'detail', 'long', 'series', 'are', 'fights', 'Natives', 'insane', 'militia', 'man', 'named', 'Schimmelhorn', 'who', 'believe', 'was', 'historical', 'character', 'huge', 'cattle', 'drive', 'bring', 'stock', 'Texas', 'Colorado', 'start', 'huge', 'ranch', 'founded', 'Oliver', 'Seccombe', 'Englishman', 'who', 'originally', 'came', 'west', 'write', 'book', 'fell', 'love', 'land', 'Then', 'sheep', 'are', 'brought', 'have', 'classic', 'cattlemen', 'vs.', 'shepherd', 'story', 'Also', 'farmers', 'start', 'taking', 'up', 'land', 'couple', 'son', 'actors', 'who', 'come', 'town', 'cause', 'nothing', 'trouble', 'are', 'various', 'sorts', 'shoot-outs', 'killer', 'blizzard', 'dust', 'storms', 'cause', 'good', 'wife', 'go', 'mad', 'finally', 'jerk', 'who', 'hunters', 'up', 'helicopters', 'can', 'shoot', 'bald', 'eagles.It', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'assign', 'stars', 'variety', 'reasons', 'One', 'reason', 'extent', 'early', 'footage', 'used', 'flash-backs', 'when', 'someone', 'telling', 'story', 'past', 'Bad', 'same', 'segments', 'are', 'used', 'several', 'times', 'when', 'one', 'segment', 'Schimmelhorn', 'Massacre', 'used', 'twice', 'single', 'episode', 'was', 'going', 'too', 'far', 'understand', 'seeing', 'once', 'not', 'same', 'someone', 'viewing', 'episode', 'week', 'twice', 'single', 'episode', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'right.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'loved', 'seeing', 'incredible', 'scenery', 'top', 'actors', 'story', 'one', 'James', 'Michener']",N/A

45774,A3KZTEUNNB20OY,0783215126,book lover,"[1, 1]","Just watched the entire series so it is fresh in my head.  When it first aired I was only about 13 years old and my interest was limited to the first several episodes with the Indian Wars.  After that, I lost interest.  But now, being older and more mature (I hope), I watched all of it.  Despite some minor gripes, this was certainly an epic TV mini-series.  Between Centennial and Into the West, Centennial wins hands down.  Not even close.  One minor gripe I had is this: the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 was the first with the Plains Indians, at least the first one that mattered.  Yet, prior to that treaty in the mini-series, there were several mentions of other broken treaties, as if there had been a long history already in place of broken treaties and white-Indian conflict.  Of course, that history was still in the making.  So it is a minor gripe, but nothing too serious.  I don't know how close the series followed the book, but I was disappointed with the deaths of several of the main characters, as I didn't feel they went out in a befitting style, such as one character caught napping, after which he was hung, another is shot in the back (actually two of them were) and yet another falls under a train while running after it.  This is not so much a gripe as an observation... these scenes left me feeling a little disappointed on a personal level.  Again, I don't know if all these incidents are in the book or not.  I enjoyed some of the later episodes more than I thought I would (such as the trail drive and the controversy around the Wendell family), but the very last episode was definitely not a high point.  Nothing to do with the acting, just the story.  Whereas I felt an emotional attachment to characters from the earlier episodes, this last installment failed to capture me in any way.  Maybe because it was just too modern, to close to the present day, and too much about politics.  Something I never cared about.  Lastly, I want to compliment actor Stephen McHattie who played the half-French/half-Arapaho warrior Jake Pasquinel.  He stole every scene.  Period.  He owned the screen.  It's not something I usually notice, but in this case, his portrayal was, at least to me, spellbinding.

The first was to see Centennial out on DVD, and the second was to see the extreme bargain price it is selling for.Centennial was in the upper tier of mini-series. The cast was deep and talented, and the plot is very true to the historical Michener novel. I saw all or most of the big mini-series of the 70s and 80s, and I think this was my favorite. Centennial spans lifetimes, and I was fully involved in each. I thrilled to their happy times and successes, and I grieved with their losses. I'll never forget my reaction to the death of one of my best liked characters ... 30+ years after I first saw that scene. I felt like I'd gotten to know him and that I'd just witnessed the loss of a good friend.If you can imagine the movie ""How the West was Won"" going on night after night for hours on end, and each of those hours being as intensely fascinating as each segment of that epic film, then you'll have a handle on the experience of watching Centennial.The cast was a Who's Who of top television and motion picture talent, plus some up and comers like Stephanie Zimbalist and Gregory Harrison who would go on to greater fame in other television vehicles of the 80s.If you've never seen this, you should grab it now. You won't regret it.The picture on these DVDs is sharp and clean. The colors are bright. There is just a touch of graininess from blowing up the picture to a large widescreen format.

You should also be aware that some of the characters are a composite of real people who were part of the state's history.Over 20 hours long, this mini-series included many well-known actors of the day: Richard Chamberlain (Scottish trapper Alexander McKeag), Robert Conrad (French trapper Pasquinel), Raymond Burr (German merchant Herman Bockweiss), Barbara Carrera (Clay Basket), Gregory Harrison (Mennonite farmer Levi Zendt), Alex Karras (Volga Deutscher immigrant Hans Brumbaugh), Richard Crenna (Frank Skimmerhorn aka John Chivington, a Colonel at the time of the U.S. Civil War who gained infamy for theSand CreekMassacre of peaceful Native Americans on the Colorado plains in 1864), Dennis Weaver (cow hand R.J. Poteet), Timothy Dalton, Andy Griffith, Mark Harmon, Brian Keith, Lynn Redgrave, Robert Vaughn, Anthony Zerbe, Stephanie Zimbalist, David Jansen, and numerous other well-known actors (even a young George Clooney in one episode as an extra in the Indian village scene -- it was his TV debut).The episodes as they appeared from October 1978 through February 1979 included:1. Only the Rocks Live Forever2. The Yellow Apron3. The Wagon and the Elephant4. For as Long as the Water Flows5. The Massacre6. The Longhorns7. The Shepherds8. The Storm9. The Crime10.

45779,A2HRY3I63HQ7E3,0783215126,"Bruce W. ""Bruce W.""","[59, 59]","I read Michner's 'Centennial' in 1975.  I lived in Nebraska at the time.In 1978 I was living in Boulder, CO, attending CU.  I read in the paper that a casting company in Denver was looking for extras for a production of CENTENNIAL.  My wife (now ex-wife) and I went down to the casting company.  We met Chris who signed us on to the project.  Chris was looking for Native American extras.  We were both of Native American descent, my wife being full-blooded Lakota.  We showed up early each morning east of Greely, CO., on location near the Platte River.  We were in the story line that tells the story of Lame Beaver, an Arapaho, stealing horses from the Comanches.  These were the first horses for Lame Beaver's band.  One day we followed Lame Beaver, Navajo actor Ray Tracey, as we snuck up on foot on the Comanche camp, to steal horses.  Lame Beaver (Ray) rides off on a pony, stampeding the Comanches horse herd, while the rest of us ran after Lame Beaver and the captured horses.The production didn't have all the Native American extras it needed, so the next day we dressed up as Comanches and chased ourselves (yesterday we were Arapahos) away.  It was great fun!  Robert Conrad was great.  He hung out with the extras and even did his famous battery commercial.  I met Barbara Carrera...what a fox!  The tipi's on the set were used for the extras to crash in or to store equipment.  In one scene where a group of Indians is running along a ridge line shot from a distance; my moccasin came off and I stepped on a cactus.  If you look closely, you will see one Indian hopping along on one foot...that's me.  The 'Hollywood' wranglers were very racist against the Indians and were usually high on coke.  Several Indian cowboys from the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota showed off their bareback riding skills.  I remember one Lakota who's last name was Cross or Cross Dog was expert at riding bareback at full gallop.  That guy could ride.  We were paid $55 a day and were fed like royalty.  Michner was on the set occassionally though I never met him.  In one scene, I dressed like an Indian scout, wearing a coyote skin on my head, and rode before the band in a pouring rain.  Me and another guy dressed similarly had to negoitiate a very slippery rocky terrain in the rain, riding Hollywood ponies.  We got through the scene without going down on the slippery rock with our ponies.The scene was edited out of the final production.  Another scene that was filmed at night was when Clay Basket, now an old woman, goes out by the horse herd to voluntary give up her life by succumbing to the cold in a blizzard.  The filming was done in the fall and there was no snow.  The movie people brought out this machine that sprayed white soap flakes all over the place.  In an hour the set looked like a blizzard had just occured.  The problem with the soap flakes was the horses in the herd, near Clay Basket, ate the soap flakes and started farting noisely.  They got through the shot but no one wanted to ride the Hollywood stock for a few days.  In the scene where an older Lame Beaver played by Michael Ansara,'stakes himself out', to meet the enemy; we fought with dried raw hide sheids and rubber tomahawks and spears.  The problem was none of us had been trained to simulate a fight scene without knocking the crap out of each other.  I got whacked several time, busted my knuckles on the rawhid shield and unintentially just about took one guys head off in the fight scene.  Look for it when Lame Beaver stakes himself out.  Some of those blows going on in the background are real.  After the fight we laughed about the beating we had all taken and limped off to our crash tipi to nurse our wounds.  We were stars!  The staff and actors; Conrad, Carrera, Tracey, Michael Ansara, Ivan Naranjo and Richard Chamberlane treated us kindly.  The only incidents the marred our experience were the Hollywood wranglers.  The local cowboys from the Greely area were repectful and got along great with the Native American extras.  I've done other extra work on movies filmed in the Denver area but CENTENNIAL was the by far the most interesting and fun.  I hope this trip down memory lane enhances your viewing experience of CENTENNIAL.

I saw it at Best Buy for about $50 and was going to buy it, but I thought about checking Amazon first. Good thing that I did because it was a lot cheaper here. Centennial tells the story of how America was made from the view point of several characters. I found Centennial to be just as entertaining (if not more now) as I did watching it as a 5-6 year old. For the 70's the cast was considered all-star though most of the younger generation will not know who most of the cast is. Even though it was made in the 70's I did not get the feeling that the mini series was dated as being a 70's movie. This is probably mostly due to the period costumes that were worn. Centennial also brought up problems of pollution, overuse, race, and injustice that are hot issues today, but they identified these issues over 30 years ago. The collection gives you over 20 hours of mostly enjoyable viewing (although in my opinion the last two episodes are sort of boring, especially when they start filming in the present day 1970's) introducing different characters as time goes from the late 1600's to 1970's Colorado.

The script has many strong and accurate lines explaining the plight of America's first people. Asian and Latino contributions in the building of America are also included.  After the 6th chapter of the third disc, the small Native American population, led by an accurately named Arapaho Chief, ""Lost Eagle"", seem to symbolically wander aimlessly through the progress of America's industrial age while the African, Chinese and Latino American's stories seem to just begin. Pasquinel, the French fur trapper, (Robert Conrad) achieves high marks as the fearless bridge between the Indians, whom respect and admire his courage, and his white counterparts of the white world, misunderstand his relationship with the Indians or disregard him as crazy. Alexander McKeag (Richard Chamberlan) and Claybasket (Barbera Carrera) do outstanding jobs as forbidden love since Claybaskets father only wishes her to marry Pasquinel. The offspring, Jake and Mike are loyal to the plight of the natives, but even more interesting is the fact that the elder Jake (Stephen McHattie), is branded the villainous Indian savage throughout the entire series while ironically, everything he says pertaining to his version of the American Indian, in the end, becomes truth.In the building of the town Centennial, the stories of each founding citizen overlap the previous landowners and founders. The struggle for prosperity and survival against mother nature prove to be factors in creating this small fictional town in Colorado. There is betrayal, adultery, corruption and all the necessary drama to keep a small town alive, but I couldn't help notice that halfway through the series, many of the characters began to retell the past which guarantees clips from earlier chapters about the Indians, the cattle drive, the Zendt family and the interesting but, shortlived murder investigation as the chief investigator, Sheriff Axel Dumire (Brian Keith) is shot by a hired gun. The most impressive character I found in the whole series was Hans Brumbaugh, impressively played by Alex Karras. His humility, hard working and even just decision to join a trio that ends the killings brought on by two hired guns made me admire and sympathize with colonialist. The courtroom scene with Vanessa Redgrave explaining how Mexican immigrants work for the benefit of the community entitles them to a fair sense of treatment and dignity is way ahead of its time.It would have been interesting to keep some of the Indians bloodline alive by telling of the US Governments enforcement of boarding school systems; the devastation and survival of alcoholism and the entry of native men into the military. Instead, we see a strong people weakened by peace and even weaker present day natives living in poverty on the Indian reservation while Centennial becomes a narrative on whom gets rich off of the resources of the land and whom wants to retain its beauty and its grandeur as an example for the rest of America.Great landscapes and fine acting makes this series a worthy buy.Cast in alphabetical order are Michael Ansara plays Lame Beaver with William Atherton as Jim Lloyd; Raymond Burr; Richard Crenna as the driven Col. Frank Skimmerhorn out to kill off the Indian race; Timothy Dalton as Oliver Seccombe, a Scotsman that wants to write a book, but ends up creating a cattle empire; Cliff De Young as John Skimmerhorn, son of Col. Skimmerhorn, but more admirable contributer to the cattle industry; Chad Everett as Major Maxwell Mercy, the peacemaker driven to save the Indians from further genocide; Gregory Harrison as Levi Zendt, the founding mercantile of Centennial who's life is devastated, but he literally builds Centennial; A. Martinez is Tranquilino Marquez, a migrant worker; Dennis Weaver as R. J. Poteet, the hired cattledriver foreman; Anthony Zerbe is Mervin Wendell, a traveling entertainer whom swindles his wealth and prosperity through questionable land deals.Although it might seem outdated by some viewers standards, for me, Centennial's script, storyline and cinematography are more meaningful and prophetic to Spielbergs' ""Into The West"" and HBO's ""Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee"".",3,"Strong beginning, narrative end",1306713600,"05 30, 2011",2011,4313,"['lengthy', 'made', 'TV', 'series', 'most', 'find', 'challenge', 'sit', 'find', 'refreshing', 'even', 'decades', 'first', 'airing', 'script', 'many', 'strong', 'accurate', 'lines', 'explaining', 'plight', 'America', 'first', 'people', 'Asian', 'Latino', 'contributions', 'building', 'America', 'are', 'also', 'included', '6th', 'chapter', 'third', 'disc', 'small', 'Native', 'American', 'population', 'led', 'accurately', 'named', 'Arapaho', 'Chief', 'Lost', 'Eagle', 'seem', 'symbolically', 'wander', 'aimlessly', 'progress', 'America', 'industrial', 'age', 'African', 'Chinese', 'Latino', 'American', 'stories', 'seem', 'just', 'begin', 'Pasquinel', 'French', 'fur', 'trapper', 'Robert', 'Conrad', 'high', 'marks', 'fearless', 'bridge', 'Indians', 'whom', 'respect', 'admire', 'courage', 'white', 'counterparts', 'white', 'world', 'misunderstand', 'relationship', 'Indians', 'disregard', 'crazy', 'Alexander', 'McKeag', 'Richard', 'Chamberlan', 'Claybasket', 'Barbera', 'Carrera', 'do', 'outstanding', 'jobs', 'forbidden', 'love', 'Claybaskets', 'only', 'marry', 'Pasquinel', 'offspring', 'Jake', 'Mike', 'are', 'loyal', 'plight', 'natives', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'fact', 'elder', 'Jake', 'Stephen', 'McHattie', 'branded', 'villainous', 'Indian', 'savage', 'entire', 'series', 'ironically', 'everything', 'pertaining', 'version', 'American', 'Indian', 'end', 'truth.In', 'building', 'town', 'Centennial', 'stories', 'founding', 'citizen', 'previous', 'landowners', 'founders', 'struggle', 'prosperity', 'survival', 'mother', 'nature', 'prove', 'be', 'factors', 'creating', 'small', 'fictional', 'town', 'Colorado', 'betrayal', 'adultery', 'corruption', 'necessary', 'drama', 'keep', 'small', 'town', 'alive', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'halfway', 'series', 'many', 'characters', 'began', 'retell', 'past', 'clips', 'earlier', 'chapters', 'Indians', 'cattle', 'drive', 'Zendt', 'family', 'interesting', 'shortlived', 'murder', 'investigation', 'chief', 'investigator', 'Sheriff', 'Axel', 'Dumire', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'shot', 'hired', 'gun', 'most', 'impressive', 'character', 'found', 'whole', 'series', 'was', 'Hans', 'Brumbaugh', 'impressively', 'played', 'Alex', 'Karras', 'humility', 'hard', 'working', 'even', 'just', 'decision', 'join', 'trio', 'killings', 'brought', 'two', 'hired', 'guns', 'made', 'admire', 'sympathize', 'colonialist', 'courtroom', 'scene', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'explaining', 'how', 'Mexican', 'immigrants', 'work', 'benefit', 'community', 'fair', 'sense', 'treatment', 'dignity', 'way', 'ahead', 'time.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'keep', 'Indians', 'bloodline', 'alive', 'telling', 'US', 'Governments', 'enforcement', 'boarding', 'school', 'systems', 'devastation', 'survival', 'alcoholism', 'entry', 'native', 'men', 'military', 'Instead', 'see', 'strong', 'people', 'weakened', 'peace', 'even', 'weaker', 'present', 'day', 'living', 'poverty', 'Indian', 'reservation', 'Centennial', 'narrative', 'whom', 'rich', 'resources', 'land', 'whom', 'retain', 'beauty', 'grandeur', 'example', 'rest', 'America.Great', 'landscapes', 'fine', 'acting', 'series', 'worthy', 'buy.Cast', 'alphabetical', 'order', 'are', 'Michael', 'Ansara', 'Lame', 'Beaver', 'William', 'Atherton', 'Jim', 'Lloyd', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'Richard', 'Crenna', 'driven', 'Col.', 'Frank', 'Skimmerhorn', 'kill', 'off', 'Indian', 'race', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'Oliver', 'Seccombe', 'Scotsman', 'write', 'book', 'up', 'creating', 'cattle', 'empire', 'Cliff', 'De', 'Young', 'John', 'Skimmerhorn', 'son', 'Col.', 'Skimmerhorn', 'more', 'admirable', 'contributer', 'cattle', 'industry', 'Chad', 'Everett', 'Major', 'Maxwell', 'Mercy', 'peacemaker', 'driven', 'save', 'Indians', 'further', 'genocide', 'Gregory', 'Harrison', 'Levi', 'Zendt', 'founding', 'mercantile', 'Centennial', 'who', 'life', 'devastated', 'literally', 'Centennial', 'A.', 'Martinez', 'Tranquilino', 'Marquez', 'migrant', 'worker', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'R.', 'J.', 'Poteet', 'hired', 'cattledriver', 'foreman', 'Anthony', 'Zerbe', 'Mervin', 'Wendell', 'traveling', 'entertainer', 'whom', 'wealth', 'prosperity', 'questionable', 'land', 'might', 'seem', 'outdated', 'viewers', 'standards', 'Centennial', 'script', 'storyline', 'cinematography', 'are', 'more', 'meaningful', 'prophetic', 'Spielbergs', 'West', 'HBO', 'Bury', 'My', 'Heart', 'Wounded', 'Knee']",N/A

Like all classic mini's, it offers a huge cast of noted names, many intertwined plots, and great production values (the exteriors clearly *are* exteriors, the costumes, props, and so on are meticulously researched, and everything looks as if it belongs).  The series traces the history of the town of Centennial, Colorado, and its environs from 1795 to the late 1970's, beginning with the arrival of the French-Canadian coureur de bois, Pasquinel (Robert Conrad), by way of St. Louis and the Pawnee country, well before even Lewis and Clark had crossed the Missouri River.  The first episode is the longest and may try viewers' patience, but bear with it: there's a lot to establish, and it's safe to say that if Pasquinel hadn't come along when (and how) he did, none of the subsequent events could have occurred as they did either.Rescuing a young Scots exile, Alexander McKeag (Richard Chamberlain in one of his best roles, with a wonderful Highland burr), from captivity among the Pawnees, Pasquinel takes him on as a partner, and the two become regular visitors to the Arapaho country--first as traders, later as beaver trappers.  McKeag spends years yearning hopelessly for Pasquinel's Arapaho wife, Clay Basket (Barbara Carrera), then marries her after the Frenchman's death, raises her daughter as his own, and becomes a successful trading-post owner.  His post is in fact the root of Centennial, to which, over the decades, come a wide assortment of people good, bad, and indifferent: Pasquinel's halfbreed sons, Jacques and Marcel (Stephen McHattie, Kario Salem), known to the Americans as Jake and Mike, who  become embittered renegades and die tragically trying to defend their (mother's) land and people; Levi Zendt (Gregory Harrison), a maverick young Mennonite, who starts out for Oregon in 1845, loses his bride (Stephanie Zimbalist) to a rattlesnake, and eventually marries McKeag's stepdaughter Lucinda (Cristina Raines), inherits the post, and, true to his upbringing, spends much of the next 40 years of his life working for peace--between red and white, cattlemen and farmers, cattlemen and sheepherders; Sam Purchase (Donald Pleasence), the unsavory, Indian-hating mountain man (the Indians don't like him either; they call him ""squaw killer,"" though how he earned the name is never explained); Maxwell Mercy (Chad Everett), the aptly-named Army officer who struggles for years to keep the peace between white and red, and his wife (Karen Carlson), whom Pasquinel fathered by Leza Bockweiss (Sally Kellerman), daughter of a successful German silversmith (Raymond Burr) in St. Louis); Capt. Mackintosh (Mark Harmon), Lucinda's disappointed suitor; Lost Eagle (Nick Ramus), the Arapaho chief who must stand by and watch his people massacred when a zealot militia officer (Richard Crenna) decides God has appointed him to stamp out the red menace; Hans Brumbaugh (Alex Karras), a Russian German who starts out searching for gold and becomes ""Potatoes"" Brumbaugh, the first farmer in the area and de facto leader of all who follow; Oliver Seccomb (Timothy Dalton), a handsome, dashing English aristocrat who falls deeply in love with the country, conceives the idea of large-scale cattle ranching, and brings the first herd to Centennial from Texas, sowing the seeds of range war by the way (whether he has anything to do with the two hired killers who eventually show up is never quite clear); R. J. Poteet (Dennis Weaver), the tough Texas trail boss who drives the cattle north, and John Skimmerhorn (Cliff DeYoung), whom Seccomb taps to serve as foreman of the spread; Axel Dumire (Brian Keith), the no-nonsense sheriff, tough and by-the-book but generally quiet-spoken; Charlotte Buckland (Lynn Redgrave), a stockholder's niece who knows exactly what she wants and doesn't hesitate to go after it (she begins as a visitor to the Venneford Ranch and seduces Seccomb into matrimony); Jim Lloyd (William Atherton), who arrives with the Poteet herd at 16, stays on, and is smitten with and betrayed by Levi's daughter Clemma (Adrienne LaRussa);  Martin (Mark Neely), her brother, who praises his uncles as ""brave men"" and somewhat resents his father's people; Messmore Garrett (Clint Ritchie), whose introduction of sheep sparks trouble between friends and neighbors; a pair of shifty actor/con artists (Anthony Zerbe, Lois Nettleton) who flourish like the Biblical green bay tree, and their young son Philip, torn between his loyalty to them and his admiration of Dumire, whose deputy he dreams of being, and whose final choice shapes the destiny of his descendants as well as his own; the Grebes (??, Julie Sommars) who come West in 1911 to become dry farmers, struggle and for a time succeed, then fall victim to human greed and nature's revenge;  Tranquilino Gomez (A Martinez), who even as a stoop laborer sees the United States as a land of limitless hope and opportunity, and his son, who wants to make it better; and at last, a reporter (Susan Gless) and a history professor (Andy Griffith) who join forces to discover the truth of an old rumor and persuade Jim Lloyd's grandson (David Janssen) to run for a critical political office.The series might have been improved by a better attention to, or at least establishment of, the years in which things are happening (I had to make an educated guess that Clemma, for instance, was born around 1858-9, left Centennial in 1881 and returned briefly five years later; not till the next-to-last chapter, set in the 20th century, do we see subtitles specifying dates), and I also found it odd that the 6,000,000-acre (at its peak) Venneford Ranch ran only 50,000 head (120 acres per).  I also thought the final chapter both slightly disappointing (a lot of it is flashbacks) and a bit of a cop-out, as well as being less than clear about the resolution of the situation.  Still, for the most part, this is an excellent example of its type.  Much of it is obviously based on fact, particularly the Chivington massacre at Sand Creek (1864) and the great killer Winter of '86, and the trappers' rendezvous in the second chapter is especially splendid, full of color, revelry, and a wonderful scene in which McKeag dances a Highland reel to the music of a bagpipe (and is joined by Pasquinel).  Overall, the theme is the inevitability of ongoing change: from Indian mastery of the Plains to their subjugation by the white man; from the freedom of the trapper to the coming of the settlers;  from lawlessness to law; from free range to homesteaders, sheep, and fences; from longhorns to Herefords; from near-total WASPish population to the arrival of Mexicans and Japanese fieldworkers--even the necessity of remaking oneself in order to cope with life-changing events or the evolution of one's society.  It's also the story of the land--the land that is, as the first and the next-to-last chapters remind us, all that lasts; how it draws people in and gains their love (or sometimes only their greed or fear), how it changes--or shapes--their character, their lives, their culture, and their fate; how it supports and rewards those who live with thought for the natural balance, and ultimately punishes those who don't respect it.",4,An epic of American history,1328745600,"02 9, 2012",2012,7388,"['Probably', 'only', 'mini-series', 'could', 'do', 'proper', 'justice', 'one', 'James', 'Michener',

45788,A3DSTOJPRMV674,0783215126,"Chris K. Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[150, 193]","The mammoth western epic &quot;Centennial&quot; has always deserved a storied place in television history.This ambitious effort, based on the James Michener novel of the same name, attempts to cover the history of the state of Colorado, from the days of the Native Americans to the political/environmental dealings of modern times. Clocking in at 24 hours, it's probably safe to say that rarely has so much effort been put into the television medium. Unfortunately, &quot;Centennial&quot; would have been better served to cut it's running time in half.The first five episodes of &quot;Centennial,&quot; dealing with the settling of the American frontier and the eventual clash between pioneers and Native Americans, are some of the finest hours ever produced for television. This 1978 miniseries provides an early sympathetic view of the Native American, from the appealing chief Lame Beaver, played convincingly by Michael Ansara, to his daughter Clay Basket sympathetically played by Barbara Carrera. Throw into this mix the stormy relationship of trappers Pasquinel (Robert Conrad) and McKeag (Richard Chamberlain), and you have great drama on the untamed frontier. Their lives, and the rustic, changing world in which they live, makes for terrific historical fireworks.Of course, Conrad's performance as Pasquinel, a colorful and memorable character if ever there was one, is one of the finest of his erratic career. As soon as his character leaves the film, there is an emptiness to the drama which is never quite replaced. And this emptiness damages the overall memory of this western epic.Episode five, which details the disturbing true-life incident of the Sand Creek Massacre, in which hundreds of Native Americans were brutally murdered, is probably the last hurrah of &quot;Centennial.&quot; The film soon switches gears to detail ranching life, farming struggles and the Depression. But the sense of wonder and awe seems to disappear, as the film wallows in a series of cliches (Brian Keith as the town sheriff is almost laughably bad) which resembles poor soap opera. The characters are not as multi-dimensional, and certainly not as inspiring.&quot;Centennial&quot; rebounds somewhat during the twelth and final episode in which the valid question is raised as to what type of industry is best for the state of Colorado -- living off the land as our ancestors did, or mining the countryside for its resources. David Janssen is superb as a ranch owner and descendent of Pasquinel. His brooding intensity practically washes away the bad taste left from the frustrating boredom of the previous four episodes.&quot;Centennial&quot; boasts one of the most extraordinary casts ever assembled for a motion picture. Almost too many to mention, some nods of respect must be given to Conrad, Chamberlain, Janssen, Chad Everett, Richard Crenna (in a particularly villainous role), Carrera, Lynn Redgrave, Gregory Harrison and Dennis Weaver (absolutely terrific as trail boss R.J. Poteet).Appropriate kudos must be given to the beautiful cinemaphotography and the exciting musical score of John Addison.&quot;Centennial,&quot; essentially is a television history of the United States, from the early settlers to modern times. No stone is left unturned in this epic journey, and if the ambition was a bit more than these filmmakers could actually achieve given the restraints of the budget and the limitations of its marathon length, one can forgive these starry-eyed dreamers for losing steam during the final episodes.Based on the first five episodes (11 hours) alone, &quot;Centennial&quot; is one of the finest works in television history. As a whole, the film sputters to a three-star rating. But for patient viewers, there are many diamonds to discover in the rough, unforgiving land known as &quot;Centennial.&quot;",3,"Memorable, if overlong western epic",999907200,"09 8, 2001",2001,3823,"['mammoth', 'western', 'epic', 'quot', 'Centennial', 'quot', 'always', 'deserved', 'storied', 'place', 'television', 'history.This', 'ambitious', 'effort', 'based', 'James', 'Michener', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'attempts', 'cover', 'history', 'state', 'Colorado', 'days', 'Native', 'Americans', 'political/environmental', 'dealings', 'modern', 'times', 'Clocking', '24', 'hours', 'probably', 'safe', 'say', 'rarely', 'so', 'much', 'effort', 'been', 'put', 'television', 'medium', 'Unfortunately', 'quot', 'Centennial', 'quot', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'cut', 'running', 'time', 'half.The', 'first', 'five', 'episodes', 'quot', 'Centennial', 'quot', 'dealing', 'settling', 'American', 'frontier', 'eventual', 'clash', 'pioneers', 'Native', 'Americans', 'are', 'finest', 'hours', 'ever', 'produced', 'television', '1978', 'miniseries', 'early', 'sympathetic', 'view', 'Native', 'American', 'appealing', 'chief', 'Lame', 'Beaver', 'played', 'convincingly', 'Michael', 'Ansara', 'daughter', 'Clay', 'Basket', 'sympathetically', 'played', 'Barbara', 'Carrera', 'Throw', 'stormy', 'relationship', 'trappers', 'Pasquinel', 'Robert', 'Conrad', 'McKeag', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'have', 'great', 'drama', 'untamed', 'frontier', 'lives', 'rustic', 'changing', 'world', 'live', 'terrific', 'historical', 'fireworks.Of', 'course', 'Conrad', 'performance', 'Pasquinel', 'colorful', 'memorable', 'character', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'one', 'finest', 'erratic', 'career', 'As', 'soon', 'character', 'film', 'emptiness', 'drama', 'never', 'quite', 'replaced', 'emptiness', 'damages', 'overall', 'memory', 'western', 'epic.Episode', 'five', 'details', 'disturbing', 'true-life', 'incident', 'Sand', 'Creek', 'Massacre', 'hundreds', 'Native', 'Americans', 'were', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'probably', 'last', 'hurrah', 'quot', 'Centennial.', 'quot', 'film', 'soon', 'gears', 'detail', 'ranching', 'life', 'farming', 'struggles', 'Depression', 'sense', 'wonder', 'awe', 'disappear', 'film', 'series', 'cliches', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'town', 'sheriff', 'almost', 'laughably', 'bad', 'poor', 'soap', 'opera', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'multi-dimensional', 'certainly', 'not', 'inspiring.', 'quot', 'Centennial', 'quot', 'somewhat', 'twelth', 'final', 'episode', 'valid', 'question', 'raised', 'what', 'type', 'industry', 'best', 'state', 'Colorado', 'living', 'off', 'land', 'ancestors', 'did', 'mining', 'countryside', 'resources', 'David', 'Janssen', 'superb', 'ranch', 'owner', 'descendent', 'Pasquinel', 'brooding', 'intensity', 'practically', 'away', 'bad', 'taste', 'left', 'frustrating', 'boredom', 'previous', 'four', 'episodes.', 'quot', 'Centennial', 'quot', 'one', 'most', 'extraordinary', 'casts', 'ever', 'assembled', 'motion', 'picture', 'Almost', 'too', 'many', 'mention', 'nods', 'respect', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'Conrad', 'Chamberlain', 'Janssen', 'Chad', 'Everett', 'Richard', 'Crenna', 'particularly', 'villainous', 'role', 'Carrera', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'Gregory', 'Harrison', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'absolutely', 'terrific', 'trail', 'R.J.', 'Poteet', '.Appropriate', 'kudos', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'beautiful', 'cinemaphotography', 'exciting', 'musical', 'score', 'John', 'Addison.', 'quot', 'Centennial', 'quot', 'essentially', 'television', 'history', 'United', 'States', 'early', 'settlers', 'modern', 'times', 'stone', 'left', 'unturned', 'epic', 'journey', 'ambition', 'was', 'bit', 'more', 'filmmakers', 'could', 'actually', 'achieve', 'given', 'restraints', 'budget', 'limitations', 'marathon', 'length', 'one', 'can', 'forgive', 'starry-eyed', 'dreamers', 'losing', 'steam', 'final', 'episodes.Based', 'first', 'five', 'episodes', '11', 'hours', 'alone', 'quot', 'Centennial', 'quot', 'one', 'finest', 'works', 'television', 'history', 'whole', 'film', 'sputters', 'three-star', 'rating', 'patient', 'viewers', 'are', 'many', 'diamonds', 'discover', 'rough', 'unforgiving', 'land', 'known', 'quot', 'Centennial.', 'quot']",N/A

That phenomenal mini-series was a landmark and a television event. Well close on it's heels came ""Centennial"". And while ""Centennial"" doesn't garner the press or praise ""Roots"" still generates three decades later...it should. ""Centennial"" doesn't play out like a conventional mini-series. It actually aired in similar fashion to ""Prison Break"" or ""24"". A season long series which aired weekly, not on consecutive nights as was so common on network TV back in the day.The DVD set consists of six disks. Two episodes per disk, with the first chapter ""Only The Rocks Live Forever"" and the final chapter ""The Scream of the Eagles"" running two and half hours. All of the other episodes clock in at 90 minutes. There is a bonus feature on disk 2 called ""Memories of Centennial"" which is very good. We get interviews with various cast members recalling their days filming this magnificent epic. (Barbara Carrera who plays Clay Basket is still stunning!!)The story itself is simply amazing. The cast is pitch perfect, and once seen you will never forget the characters you are introduced to.I don't want to give out any spoilers by retelling any of the storyline. If interested, there are numerous reviews here that go into great detail. Everyone should be familiar with this tale, as it is OUR story. A true American tale, warts and all. This series will truly have you laughing, crying and cheering. At times you will be proud of our American heritage and the men who forged this country. And at times you will want to hang your head in shame at the high cost so many people paid so that a new nation could be born.I was going to deduct 1 star from my rating for the final chapter ""The Scream of the Eagles"". While not awful, it only links to the preceeding chapters in setting. Some familiar last names pop up, but the final chapter is basically like a ""clip show"" from a great TV series. Andy Griffith running around modern day Centennial with Sharon Gless gets kind of dull. I'm sure that when this aired on TV, it was probably nice to re-visit clips of Pasquinel, Alexander McKeag, Levi Zendt etc. because they hadn't been part of the series for several weeks, but on DVD the flashbacks are basically rehashing scenes you had seen either days or hours earlier, and it feels as though the last chapter is 80% padding and 20% environmental message. I thought the final scene in the chapter ""The Winds of Death"" would have made a perfect ending. But I couldn't deduct a star from my review, the series taken as a whole is worth 5-stars and the DVD treatment looks wonderful.This type of TV is no longer around, and it's a real shame, but luckily these fantastic shows are now available on DVD.

I was 11 years old when filming started on this epic in 1978 (took 2 years to complete and it was on location to boot.  That's not done as much anymore for epics of this magnitude.)  I grew up watching it on tape (had taped it off cable in the mid 80's) and wore the tapes out!  Bought the VHS box set for my mom about 5 years ago for Christmas (she's also another Centennial fan) and we're about to wear those tapes out between the two of us.  This has just GOT to come out on DVD soon.I don't think I could add anything else to what others have already said, but if you haven't had the opportunity to see this masterpiece of historical fiction, you are really missing out.  The characters are so well-defined, you can't help but get caught up in the events and people that shaped the town of Centennial.  From Lame Beaver, the Arapaho warrior and his family and Pasquinel and Alexander McKeag (the first white men to arrive in the area along the South Platte river,) to the 1800's when people were moving westward in search of something more or just plain getting away (like Levi Zendt and his first wife, Ellie, who had been ostracized from a Mennonite community in Pennsylvania) and others who wanted adventure (like the British aspring adventurer-turned-rancher Oliver Seacombe,) they planted the seeds for the town which became Centennial.  There are also many more memorable characters, too numerous to mention, reacting and surviving the changing times around them.  This one has it all:  great story, simply beautiful location, an outstanding ensemble cast, and historical facts blend together to create something really special.So, with that said, let's get this one out on DVD!",5,A Must-Have for any miniseries fan,1097452800,"10 11, 2004",2004,1746,"['was', 'miniseries', 'got', 'hooked', 'genre', 'was', '11', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'filming', 'started', 'epic', '1978', 'took', '2', 'years', 'complete', 'was', 'location', 'boot', 'not', 'done', 'as', 'much', 'epics', 'magnitude', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'tape', 'had', 'taped', 'off', 'cable', 'mid', '80', 'wore', 'tapes', 'out', 'Bought', 'VHS', 'box', 'set', 'mom', '5', 'years', 'ago', 'Christmas', 'also', 'Centennial', 'fan', ""'re"", 'wear', 'tapes', 'out', 'two', 'just', 'GOT', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'soon.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'add', 'anything', 'else', 'what', 'others', 'have', 'already', 'said', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'opportunity', 'see', 'masterpiece', 'historical', 'fiction', 'are', 'really', 'missing', 'out', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'well-defined', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'events', 'people', 'shaped', 'town', 'Centennial', 'Lame', 'Beaver', 'Arapaho', 'warrior', 'family', 'Pasquinel', 'Alexander', 'McKeag', 'first', 'white', 'men', 'arrive', 'area', 'South', 'Platte', 'river', '1800', 'when', 'people', 'were', 'moving', 'westward', 'search', 'something', 'more', 'just', 'plain', 'getting', 'away', 'Levi', 'Zendt', 'first', 'wife', 'Ellie', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'ostracized', 'Mennonite', 'community', 'Pennsylvania', 'others', 'who', 'wanted', 'adventure', 'British', 'aspring', 'adventurer-turned-rancher', 'Oliver', 'Seacombe', 'planted', 'seeds', 'town', 'became', 'Centennial', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'more', 'memorable', 'characters', 'too', 'numerous', 'mention', 'reacting', 'surviving', 'changing', 'times', 'one', 'great', 'story', 'simply', 'beautiful', 'location', 'outstanding', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'historical', 'facts', 'blend', 'together', 'create', 'something', 'really', 'special.So', 'said', 'let', 'get', 'one', 'out', 'DVD']",N/A

45810,AZB4CQ9JZSUQB,0783215126,Eric Pregosin,"[1, 2]","In the fall of 1978, NBC's ""Big Event"" launched a real BIG EVENT namely James Michener's Centennial (yes folks it's even bigger than Shogun).  The story of the founding of a fictional town in Colorado and the events leading up to it and beyond.  Beginning in the days where Indians ruled the west and ending in the then present (albeit only 1 episode of 12 takes place in the present) we see a beautiful look of life in the Rocky Mountains and the surrounding area.  In his own introduction to part 1, Michener himself tells us that while the story is fictional and its characters are imaginary, that there were real people in history like those played by Robert Conrad, Richard Chamberlain, Raymond Burr, Michael Ansara and others.  Several real events in history were also reenacted as well to help tell the story.  And there are even some narrative moments by David Janssen who would himself play a prominent character at the end of the story.

45814,A1YTR8FI6UPMA6,0783215126,Get Serious,"[0, 0]","With over six-hundred reviews of this mini-series, which is now over thirty years old what more can one say? I won't reiterate the plot or the book. Western writers often write stories which are a compendium of various happenings in the old west from many locations in an effort to create a viable story line. Michener was no exception. The difference here is that the film summarizes a story which takes place from the very first time a white man set foot on the continent until the present day. That is an incredibly long timeline! Since the series is close to twenty-one hours long, the editors must have been dealing with three times this much footage. That's a hell of a lot of footage to sift through. The major complaint I have about the series is that there was little character development. But since there were so many characters and subplots, this would have been impossible to do and bring the overall series in under thirty hours! So there are a lot of shortcuts that the viewer must fill in. The storyline is somewhat scattered, which I can't define, since I haven't yet read the book. Michener and the producers spent a lot of time on some subplots, which should have been shortened; and several others, which should have been lengthened...so this was probably an editing fault in the overwhelming job of going through so much footage. The major focus appears to be on the many mistakes and wrongdoings of the ""white man"" in absorbing the American continent and because of this, the series can be quite depressing! Michener attempts to balance the causes and misunderstandings, which caused most of the problems and he goes into a great deal of detail here. The Indian--White Man interaction has been re-analyzed to death, with little overall solution. You can't fix death, bad decisions and misery brought on by greed, stupidity, ignorance and pure evil! Although it is true, the Tribes could be brutal, vicious and animalistic; the Europeans were likewise unforgiving in dealing with them!If you study The Nations and the tribes still in existence in the US and Canada, it is pretty much black and white, what was done wrong. Misunderstandings--a White kills an Indian, and therefore an Indian must kill a white. Firepower and an overwhelming population will always overcome Indigent occupiers. Let's mention the Buffalo as an example. There were six BILLION buffalo (American Bison) in the Americas before Europeans showed up. These were a tasty low-cholesterol, healty meat. These animals fed on six natural grasses, which had been indigent to the Americas for millions of years! Everything was in balance. Prarie dogs were prevalent, because buffalo hoofs were too large to get tripped in their holes! Enter the European with his diseased cattle. European cattle couldn't eat the indigenous grasses and broke their small legs in the prarie dog holes. Farmers tore up the grasses, which kept the dust down and kept the land pristine and green. This resulted in the catastrophic dust storms of the early 1900s. Few ever talked TO the tribes. Many spokespersons of the Nations have reiterated that both races could have helped each other immensely, as they both had different areas of expertise...this did not happen. Now the land is a shambles and the Tribes are on reservations with Alcohol Fetal disease and poverty. But 20-20 hindsight cannont fix this. Michener also concentrates on the plight of the Mexican, who picked fruit seasonally in the US and then went home for the winter, saying they were getting a bad deal. This may have some merit in them not being properly compensated, but now they own three of our states! The real value of this entire series, I believe is the fact that it is a linear timeline! I know of no other work which illustrates the American experience as well in describing: the first trappers, the Indian Nations in natural habitat, the cattle ranchers, the sheep farmers, the vegetable farmers, the government and the progression of all these entities forward to the present day.The final message of Michener takes place in present day, in which it is reiterated that we have destroyed the earth and the land and it is our responsibility to clean it up and return it to pristine! In addition, the series reiterates that the US is perhaps the only country on this planet which showcases every single race and attempts (although unsuccessfully) to proscribe our total equality. Bad governments are defined in the series and things have not changed at all in this respect with our terrible government now in place. The series makes you think...it puts past interactions in your face and leaves you with a rather depressing hopelessness...rather than a hope for the future. Overall not a pleasant situation or state of affairs! Acting is exemplary,as is direction by the four directors and exterior photography is exceptional. See it for the linear expression of our history...it's difficult to find something so comprehensive from any other source!",5,Extraordinary!,1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,4996,"['six-hundred',

We could walk about outside around the cabins, but could not leave the mountain until the snowplow got up the hill. We had a vcr player, plenty of food, water, heat and down blankets, treats and Centennial.  The cabin owners had taped it from the tv mini series.  I was captivated.  As a storyteller I have often performed as Martha Jane Canary (Calamtiy Jane); so watching this epic was a wonderful visual panaroma of the early west!  I felt as if I had stepped backwards into the early days of our country and especially Colorado, a state I dearly love. We were walking in the shoes of the Native Americans and Pioneers and for a brief few hours feeling as if we were a part of their lives.  We watched more tv in that time period than is usually good for a person!  The acting and storyline was exceptional; but the scenery was the real show stealer. The cinematographer was brilliant! VCR's did not have the depth of the new DVD's, and this was copied from the TV and still the vibrant colors and beauty of the mountians was right in the room with you!  I can't wait to see how the DVD format improves the viewing.  I strongly recommend this epic western to viewers.  It takes awhile to view the entire series, but it is worth the effort.  It is an excellent ""January"" project; if you live in a cold climate.  The youthfullness of Richard Chamberland and the Robert Conrads joyous portrayal of Pasquinal is unforgettable.  When you watch you get the idea that the actors thoroughly enjoyed their roles, they bring the characters to life in a way that cannot be done if one is unhappy in the role.  While I ""know"" that television and movies glamorize history, I thought Centennial gave the people, events and story more guts than glamor.  The richness of the peoples lives caught you from the first tape and held you to the last credits.  We didn't want it to end, but just keep going.  My husband bought me the vcr set for the next Christmas so we could watch it any time.  We still like to start at the beginning and just methodically go through each tape beginning to end.  Hopefully, the DVD version will be out soon.  So, to all I can say with gusto - ENJOY!

The earlier episodes are better than the latter ones.  The book is also quite good, and not as romanticized as the movie.  For example, Clay Basket and McKeag die of yellow fever in the novel, but in the movie, their deaths are more, shall we say, heroic?  Putting the book and the movie together is a good first lesson in US western history.The movie certainly failed in showing what happened to ""the Stolfus girl"" and Levi Zendt.  There was much more explanation in the book, where Peter Stolfus punches Levi in the face after Levi's apology.  The women at the market started crying when they saw Becky, remembering how beautiful THEY used to be.  This does not occur in the movie at all.Levi's return to visit where he grew up forty years later is not handled properly in the movie.  In the book, Levi's brothers have to intervene to get a scared Mahlon to propose to her.  And Levi comes back to find a white-haired Becky with five kids!

I was 10 years old and I watched it when it originally aired on television.  I had an early love with history and I was glued to the tv set.  Centennial was the first representation of American history for me where the European Americans were not the heroes and the Native Americans were portrayed as victims.  There is one poignant scene where a Native American village, filled with just the elderly, women and children, is violently attacked.  That scene was seared into my brain.  James Michener educated as well as entertained.  He was a master story teller and Centennial is a masterful example of his talent.  This DVD set is beautifully packaged and contains 6 discs.Disc 1Chapter 1: ""Only the Rocks Live Forever""When adventurous Quebec trapper Pasquinel and Scotsman McKeag attempt to do business with an Arapaho chieftain, their dealings will create an uneasy alliance and fuel their real desire - to find gold.Chapter 2:  ""The Yellow Apron""As tensions mount between the white settlers and the Native Americans, Pasquinel finds himself tied to two women, and McKeag must fight against his passion for a Native American maiden and his partner's wife.Disc 2Chapter 3: ""The Wagon and the Elephant""The town of Centennial is born when dire circumstances force a young Mennonite, Levi, and his bride-to-be to create a ramshackle settlement in the rugged West.Chapter 4:  ""For as Long as the Waters Flow""Life and death hang in the balance, and Levi copes by boarding himself up in Pasquinel and McKeag's old cabin.  When a stranger with an unusual past arrives, will the town of Centennial have a second chance?Disc 3Chapter 5:  ""The Massacre""Civil War ignites across the country and while the Pasquinel brothers become intent on killing homesteaders and soldiers, the Native Americans face an even more bloodthirsty foe.Chapter 6:  ""The Longhorn""New industry, in the form of British ranch investor Oliver Seccombe, comes to Centennial, and soon men from far and wide are roped into a massive cattle drive.Disc 4Chapter 7:  ""The Shepherds""Greed changes the landscape of Centennial as a group of farmers takes up arms against the rowdy cattle barons and their men.Chapter 8:  ""The Storm""A con man and his family make a splashy debut in town, but the real smoke screen appears when a foreign accountant takes a disparaging financial look at the town's profitable Venneford ranch.Disc 5Chapter 9:  ""The Crime""There are plenty of tricks and tribulations as the Wendell family continue their schemes and a young widow, Charlotte Seccombe, returns to Centennial to run the Venneford ranch.Chapter 10:  ""The Winds of Fortune""Newcomers attract attention when a violent gang challenges the sheriff to a showdown, while Japanese laborers put everything on the line when they attempt to run their own farms.Disc 6Chapter 11:  ""The Winds of Death""A real estate tycoon lures Eastern families to Centennial with promises of fertile land, while Mexican residents find their rights rapidly disappearing in the homeland they've inhavited for centuries.Chapter 12:  ""The Scream of Eagles""Politics get dirty as two contestants face off to shape the future of Centennial and its dwindling precious resources.",5,Favorite Historical Miniseries,1333065600,"03 30, 2012",2012,3254,"['can', 'still', 'remember',

I have owned the VHS collection for over 10 years now, and have been anxiously awaiting its release on DVD.The story is big, the characters are engrossing, the scenery fabulous, and the cast stellar and enormous.  For the 1978, this was a huge TV production that, in my opinion, has yet to be surpassed by any other mini-series to date.Other reviews I have read about the DVD release have mentioned poor transferrence from video to DVD - I have to disagree.  I don't have a big, new, flat-panel widescreen to watch this on (just a regular, and now old-fashioned, 50-something inch TV), and from what I can see, the picture is great.  The colors are rich, the picture is crystal-clear, and it looks newer and better than when I first saw the show in 1978-79.The only thing I wish they had included in this box set would be cast interviews (if it's already there, I apologize for the error - but I have yet to find it), directors comments, etc.Other than that, I couldn't be happier to have this long-awaited mini-series on DVD and in my possession.

The scenery is incredible.  The fact that its roughly based on the history of the area is even more amazing considering some of the fare that makes it way to TV these days.  It is probably safe to say that we will not see an effort like this again.This series is based on the book of the same name.  It is set roughly in Colorado and spans the history of that area from the time of the earliest French traders to roughly the mid 1970's.  It mostly deals with the effects of westward expansion on the Native Americans, but there are various other issues as well.  To film it, a powerhouse cast was assembled and it spans over 12 episodes.  The cool thing about it is that each of the characters are somewhat interrelated and things that happen in early episodes come back in later episodes.  The other cool thing is that the characters are easily related too.Update:  Now that they've released this series on DVD, I can review that.  I spent the weekend watching the first 2/3's of the series and it is still as good as I remember.The DVD remastering is fantastic, in fact it is almost too fantastic as it shows some of the poor job of doing the makeup on the aging characters.

Released in 1976, at the bicentennial of our nation's history, ""Centennial"" was the novel blockbuster of the year. The screen adaptation became a bi-monthly serial that originally aired on NBC in the late 1970's. I can recall viewing it for the first time way back then and having to wait expectantly for the next show.  The made-for-tv movie is a faithful adaptation of Michener's epic novel, and like the novel, is lengthy, but is a fascinating story in itself that is over 18 hours long!  Each VHS cassette is a mini-novel in itself dealing with a specific time period in Michener's book.  It makes for excellent family viewing and is appropriate for all member of the family, from kids to grandparents.I recommend that the buyer purchase the VHS collection in ""used"" condition.  The set is so large that most viewers will only watch it once and then shelve it.  This is not to say that it is not a quality production; rather, it's length is such that it affords itself to one viewing only.  Once you watch it, either save it for viewing years later, or sell it on E-Bay.

So this review speaks to the just released Centennial on DVD.I got my copy of Centennial on DVD yesterday and I was pretty disappointed in the transfer and picture quality.  The audio is nothing to write home about, but not too bad.In the very opening where James Michener introduces the story, they have several shots of the open plains and mountain ranges.  The camera pauses momentarily on a sheer granite cliff and the pixilation is so bad that there appears to be a hypnotic disk swirling in the center of the mountainside.  Later when the camera is panning across a field of amber grain, the picture is very grainy and more pixilation occurs.I have a pretty decent DVD player and I've not had this problem with any other discs of good to very good quality, so I'm pretty sure it's the transfer.

45866,ADY2T3QG6YSHF,0783215126,Michael A. Weyer,"[1, 1]","If ever the label ""novel for television"" applied, it's to Centennial. This incredible mini-series puts the epic in sagas, telling the amazing story of one Colorado town over two hundred years of history. What strikes you is how each story easily flows right into another, showing how people can interact in real life and in this amazing area. We start in the 1700's with two trappers and end in modern (1978) Colorado and in between we see the ups and downs, good and bad of the development of American life. It's truly remarkable how it works:A French trapper (Robert Conrad) and a Dutch settler (Richard Chamberlain) meet and form a partnership in the wildreness of what will be Colorado in 1795. We move to a Mennoite, Levi Zendt (Gregory Harrison), wrongfully banished from his home and soon heading to the land, losing his love but later gaining an Indian wife (Christina Raines). We also see Hans Brumbraugh (Alex Karras) settling a farm while Englishman Oliver Seccombe (Timothy Dalton) sets up a homesteading and cattle ranch business. A shameful moment occurs as a manical soldier (Richard Crenna) leads a massacre of Indians. His son (Cliff DeYoung) tries to redeem the name by launching a cattle drive with some friends. He and Jim Lloyd (William Artheron) eventually work for Seccombe despite worries of his illegal ways. After a blizzrd kills many of his cattle and exposes his dealings, Seccombe succumbs to a hard fate. His widow (Lynn Redgrave) takes over and eventually marries Jim. Meanwhile, the Wendells, a family of con artists, arrive in town and soon find their way to fortune with a wicked crime. We see more of the town as it handles the problems of the past from range wars to outlaws to the Dust Bowl before a major election brings the story to a close.As you can tell, it's an incredible epic and the show gets it all together in an amazing way. The production is top notch and amazing as we watch the town grow from a small settlement to a prospering city. The actors handle it well, giving it their all. Conrad and Chamberlain are in fine form and DeYoung, Artheron and Karras handle their major roles in a good way, making you see the hardships of the time and having you emphathize with them. Anthony Zerbe is terrific as Wendell, showing the conniving ham who honestly can't be truthful at any time while Brian Kieth matches him as the sherrif convinced of his guilt and doing his best to prove it. Redgrave is fantastic as Charlotte, taking her tough lady to the extremes and gets some great scenes in her elderly days. On that, by 1978 standards, the makeup jobs are good showing the characters aging believably over the years.There are some dark segments like the Indian massacre and a horrible crime during the Dust Bowl. There are also some plot holes and inconsistinces like how Zebre's son seemed wanting so much to be honest but later we see him as ruthless as his father. There's also the annoying tendency of later chapters to show full scenes from earlier in the series in the middle of the story, which is more noticeable on the DVD. Also, the final episode doesn't jibe as well as the producers probably hoped as it comes off too speechy and feels disconnected from the story we've seen.Still, it's a fantastic series that gives a warts and all look at the American West and the excellent cast and writing help sell the drama, making this one of the best epic mini-series television has ever produced and worth having in one volume.",4,"While long and preachy in parts, still an incredible TV undertaking.",1251763200,"09 1, 2009",2009,3478,"['ever', 'label', 'novel', 'television', 'applied', 'Centennial', 'incredible', 'mini-series', 'epic', 'sagas', 'telling', 'amazing', 'story', 'one', 'Colorado', 'town', 'two', 'hundred', 'years', 'history', 'What', 'how', 'story', 'easily', 'right', 'showing', 'how', 'people', 'can', 'interact', 'real', 'life', 'amazing', 'area', 'start', '1700', 'two', 'trappers', 'end', 'modern', '1978', 'Colorado', 'see', 'ups', 'downs', 'good', 'bad', 'development', 'American', 'life', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'how', 'French', 'trapper', 'Robert', 'Conrad', 'Dutch', 'settler', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'meet', 'form', 'partnership', 'wildreness', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'Colorado', '1795', 'move', 'Mennoite', 'Levi', 'Zendt', 'Gregory', 'Harrison', 'wrongfully', 'banished', 'home', 'soon', 'heading', 'land', 'losing', 'love', 'later', 'gaining', 'Indian', 'wife', 'Christina', 'Raines', 'also', 'see', 'Hans', 'Brumbraugh', 'Alex', 'Karras', 'settling', 'farm', 'Englishman', 'Oliver', 'Seccombe', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'up', 'homesteading', 'cattle', 'ranch', 'business', 'shameful', 'moment', 'manical', 'soldier', 'Richard', 'Crenna', 'massacre', 'Indians', 'son', 'Cliff', 'DeYoung', 'redeem', 'name', 'launching', 'cattle', 'drive', 'friends', 'Jim', 'Lloyd', 'William', 'Artheron', 'eventually', 'work', 'Seccombe', 'worries', 'illegal', 'ways', 'blizzrd', 'many', 'cattle', 'dealings', 'Seccombe', 'hard', 'fate', 'widow', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'eventually', 'marries', 'Jim', 'Meanwhile', 'Wendells', 'family', 'con', 'artists', 'arrive', 'town', 'soon', 'find', 'way', 'fortune', 'wicked', 'crime', 'see', 'more', 'town', 'problems', 'past', 'range', 'wars', 'outlaws', 'Dust', 'Bowl', 'major', 'election', 'story', 'close.As', 'can', 'tell', 'incredible', 'epic', 'show', 'together', 'amazing', 'way', 'production', 'top', 'notch', 'amazing', 'watch', 'town', 'grow', 'small', 'settlement', 'prospering', 'city', 'actors', 'handle', 'well', 'giving', 'Conrad', 'Chamberlain', 'are', 'fine', 'form', 'DeYoung', 'Artheron', 'Karras', 'handle', 'major', 'roles', 'good', 'way', 'making', 'see', 'hardships', 'time', 'having', 'emphathize', 'Anthony', 'Zerbe', 'terrific', 'Wendell', 'showing', 'conniving', 'ham', 'who', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'truthful', 'time', 'Brian', 'Kieth', 'sherrif', 'convinced', 'guilt', 'doing', 'best', 'prove', 'Redgrave', 'fantastic', 'Charlotte', 'taking', 'tough', 'lady', 'extremes', 'great', 'scenes', 'elderly', 'days', '1978', 'standards', 'makeup', 'jobs', 'are', 'good', 'showing', 'characters', 'aging', 'believably', 'are', 'dark', 'segments', 'Indian', 'massacre', 'horrible', 'crime', 'Dust', 'Bowl', 'are', 'also', 'plot', 'holes', 'inconsistinces', 'how', 'Zebre', 'son', 'seemed', 'wanting', 'so', 'much', 'be', 'honest', 'later', 'see', 'as', 'ruthless', 'father', 'also', 'annoying', 'tendency', 'later', 'chapters', 'show', 'full', 'scenes', 'earlier', 'series', 'middle', 'story', 'more', 'noticeable', 'DVD', 'Also', 'final', 'episode', ""n't"", 'jibe', 'as', 'well', 'producers', 'probably', 'hoped', 'off', 'too', 'speechy', 'feels', 'disconnected', 'story', ""'ve"", 'seen.Still', 'fantastic', 'series', 'warts', 'look', 'American', 'West', 'excellent', 'cast', 'writing', 'help', 'sell', 'drama', 'making', 'one', 'best', 'epic', 'mini-series', 'television', 'ever', 'produced', 'worth', 'having', 'one', 'volume']",N/A
45867,A17LEYMZI8OYOQ,0783215126,"Michael B. Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[0, 0]","CENTENNIAL (1978) is one of television's most memorable mini-series.  Adapted from the best-selling novel by James A. Michener, who appears in an on-camera Introduction, the nearly 21-hour epic production tells the story of a small fictional town in Colorado, beginning before it was established in the 18th century with coming of the fur trappers and mountain men, up to modern times.  It is a magnificent achievement, shot in and around the beautiful vistas of the Rocky Mountains.The entire mini-series is now available on DVD in a handsome 6-disc/12 episode boxed set from Universal Studios Home Entertainment.  Also included is a retrospective featurette that includes the memories of the production's cast and crew members.The filming of CENTENNIAL was not without its problems.  Not only did the production encounter unexpected hardships that caused its budget to soar, but also one of the actors died in a freak accident after only one day of shooting his role.CENTENNIAL utilizes the services of four directors and also an all-star cast that includes Robert Conrad, Richard Chamberlain, Barbara Carrera, Raymond Burr, Michael Ansara, Timothy Dalton, Sally Kellerman, Lynn Redgrave, David Janssen, Dennis Weaver, Andy Griffith, Brian Keith, Clint Walker, Henry Darrow, Mark Harmon, Sharon Gless and many others.As much as I admire CENTENNIAL and still enjoy watching it, I do have a couple of minor ""bones to pick"" with the way the project was handled.  My hunch is that these issues are the result of television network interference, rather than an artistic decision by the actual filmmakers.I think that many of the roles in the mini-series were cast with actors who the network knew would garner high television ratings (e.g. Conrad, Chamberlain, Burr, etc.), rather than other ""name"" actors who might be better suited for that particular character.Also, whereas the initial 3-hour episode should have begun with the story of Arapaho Lame Beaver (Ansara), it actually begins with the fur trappers (Conrad & Chamberlain), with the Lame Beaver saga being told ""in flashback"" during hour three.  Unfortunately, these flashbacks stop the forward movement of the story.Still, I can't recommend CENTENNIAL too highly. Michael B.

45869,A39SJ6V6QCGC37,0783215126,Midge,"[5, 18]","I was not as thrilled with this mini-series as the other reviewers. I love historical epics and had high hopes for this one. I missed Centennial when it came out so I was hopeful and delighted to see all of the popular TV actors of my era again.Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in this production. It went downhill from the intro when Michener walked out on stage to talk to the audience (ala Walt Disney).The story was dry and plodded along so slowly, it was almost painful to endure.The only bright spots were the brilliant acting of Barbara Carrera and Michael Ansara. Richard Chamberlain and Raymond Burr were quite good as well.Robert Conrad (French Canadian trader) was so blatantly overacting, it was embarrassing to watch; forced garish laughter and singing; simple dialogue over enunciated; forced phony bravado. If his acting hadn't been so awful, it would have been laughable. I've never seen him perform this poorly before. I can only assume the director insisted on this forced, overly garish performance.Every major character's life was filled with tragedy from beginning to end; worse than any soap opera. Only the crooked, deceitful, or murderous characters ended up with long successful lives and natural deaths.Every decent, honest character suffered endless tragic lives and died a senseless, depressing and wholly unnecessary death. The more honest and innocent the character... the more terrible fates which befell them. (Keeping in mind, some of the ""good guys"" had started off being bad guys... murders, bigamists, crooks, etc.) Although we had ""Creative"" senseless deaths from rattlesnake bite, train, fire, bullets, freezing, exposure (stroke victim left unattended outside in a wheelchair), suicide, gold bullet, arrows, drowning (2 ft water), dust bowl induced serial murder suicide, vehicle accident, etc., at least a half dozen or more died from exertion or stress induced heart attacks. I can't believe the studio approved this repetition, not to mention, the publisher.The entire film was filled with depressing tragedies from beginning to end. Every storyline was filled with backstabbing, nasty crooks; none of which were held accountable for any crime they perpetrated. Almost all of the crooks ended up as prominent citizens with long lives and natural deaths.So basically, if you were a bad guy, you got a long, successful life with very little strife and a natural death. If you were a decent, honest person, then you had nothing but tragedy and a horrible, unnecessary death.My opinion of the quality of production has nothing to do with Michener's message. I heartily agree regarding the intolerable brutalization and killing of our native Americans and the stealing of their lands; the destruction and extinction of so many species of wildlife; the hordes of murderous, thieving thugs and every kind of rotten lowlife imaginable descending upon the wilderness and prairies... looting, cheating and killing. Our ancestors should have been ashamed at how the native Americans and minorities were savagely brutalized, killed and robbed of their land and heritage by crooked politicians, crooked Laws and crooked soldiers. Unfortunately, we still have crooked politicians and rampant corruption today. No one should try to make light of the ugly truths in our history. Nor should it be whitewashed or squelched or suppressed by those with agenda's. We cannot learn from our mistakes if we don't first teach what mistakes were made.Episodes skipped huge gaps in time and were poorly segued; causing enough confusion to make you wonder if you missed an episode. A terrible job of screen writing and directing.Andy Griffith was awful. He was cocky and overacting even in his gait and overly animated head movements while talking. He also looked as if he came directly from filming a ""Barnaby Jones"" episode.Disk 4, began frequent repetitive flashbacks throughout the last 6 episodes. This was in addition to the narratives at the beginning of every episode catching us up on what had happened on previous episodes.We also had to endure long credits of more than 50 actor's names at the beginning and end of every episode.Even worse was the terrible music score. It was just irritating noise but we had to listen to it on the opening and closing credits of every episode. The DVD's were poorly indexed making it impossible to skip past the credits.The makeup used in the aging process on the actors was flat and dingy like tempera or wall paint. Without sheen, the skin looked dead and fake. The aging appliances would have appeared quite believable if they had added a sheen and faded the skin coloring instead of darkening it.The final episode suddenly jumped from 1930's dust bowl to a 1970's version of ""Barnaby Jones"" with Andy Griffith... court trials, newspaper reporters, a sinister intrigue with the ""baddest"" bad guy in town who's hiring thugs, killing and hiding skeletons, etc. This final episode jumped 40 years in the future and did not fit the movie. It really looked as it they had stuck an episode of ""Barnaby Jones"" on the end and added Sharon Gless as a reporter just like her role in ""The Revenge of the Stepford Wives."" This last episode did not even look like it belonged as part of the Centennial series.The director also endeavored to make the huge cattle ranch look like the movie ""Giant"" where there is this enormous, grandiose mansion on a totally flat barren wasteland. People still think Texas looks like that stereotype. They have no idea we have trees, lush green grass, forests, hills, lakes, etc. instead of a barren wasteland as depicted on ""Giant"".Centennial did do a good job depicting the dust bowl. While I had heard about the dust bowl, this was the best visual depiction I have ever seen.Unfortunately, this movie was just poorly written for screen adaptation (I haven't read the book so that could also be part of the problem... however a good screenwriter and director should have been able to deal with that). The movie was poorly directed for certain and the poor acting I believe originated from the poor directing instruction they received.The movie was fraught with nonstop crooks, thieves and killers preying on any decent person who set foot on the trails, wilderness and settlements. The story was presented so terribly lopsided, it was like a ""how to do it"" guide for crooks.The mini-series ""John Adams"" dealt with similar negativity and strife concerning the events and individuals involved with the founding of our country. Yet it was a brilliantly written, produced, directed mini-series with top-notch acting.Centennial does have some educational merit for depicting the settling of the west in a more realistic manner.However, I highly recommend ""John Adams"" as one of the best historical mini-series I've ever seen. There is also quite a bit of worthwhile viewing from ""The founding of America"" although it has some problems as well but nothing like the problems with Centennial.But if you like a slow, dry, repetitive series with shallow plots which don't require much thinking... you'd probably like Centennial. Especially if you like old westerns of similar design.But if you have a short attention span and like fast paced movies, complex characters with fresh innovation and historical accuracy... this is not the movie for you.",3,2 dimensional.

45878,AYBL30P5NXNZ4,0783215126,"Mr. Stephen Kennedy ""skenn1701a""","[0, 0]","As a rule, mini series have aspired to the label `epic'.  By having starrier cast names, bigger sets, and of course more worldwide locations.  This early mini series from the late 70's did something different - it kept the same location - the fictional town of Centennial, and charted the creation and evolution of the land and then the town, and the people that came and had an impact.  So instead of the characters being large and the locations serving to tell us about the characters, the people are the ephemeral ones, passing through and hoping to leave their stamp on history.  It's typical Michener in its style, and works perfectly in the mini series format - elegiac, rather than just epic.So the story unfolds over 26 hours of TV of a beautiful bend in the river which is home to a tribe of native Americans, then comes the trappers, then the traders, the settlers, then the cattlemen, the shepherds, the farmers and civilization takes hold.  It's a satisfying and at times informative unraveling of American history, told factually, but through a fictional town.  That's not to say the characters are not well written - thanks to utterly memorable performances by the like of Robert Conrad as Pasquinel, Dennis Weaver as the cattle driver, Timothy Dalton as the rancher and yes, even Richard Chamberlain as McKeag amongst a huge cast, these are vignettes which will stay with you.If the series has a weakness, it's the tendency to give extended and unnecessary flashbacks, particularly in the later episodes where the director feels the continual need to remind us at length of what has gone before.  As for dating, it could be argued certainly that the sound quality and picture are somewhat dated now, but on the whole the series stands up remarkably well - paradoxically it is the later modern scenes with Robert Vaughn and Andy Griffith (and a young Sharon Gless) which have dated most.Perhaps the most surprising element to me watching this again for the first time in 28 years, is the emphasis on harmony on the land - the give and take that the early settlers achieved, but later generations signally failed to achieve.All in all, a worthwhile message, a handy historical summary, a fascinating cast and a collection of interesting interweaving stories - on whatever level you take it, this is well worth watching, despite its occasional flaw.",5,"Grandest of the mini series, en elegy to the West",1224720000,"10 23, 2008",2008,2361,"['rule', 'mini', 'series', 'have', 'aspired', 'label', 'epic', 'having', 'starrier', 'cast', 'names', 'bigger', 'sets', 'course', 'more', 'worldwide', 'locations', 'early', 'mini', 'series', 'late', '70', 'did', 'something', 'different', 'kept', 'same', 'location', 'fictional', 'town', 'Centennial', 'charted', 'creation', 'evolution', 'land', 'then', 'town', 'people', 'came', 'had', 'impact', 'So', 'instead', 'characters', 'being', 'large', 'locations', 'serving', 'tell', 'characters', 'people', 'are', 'ephemeral', 'ones', 'passing', 'hoping', 'leave', 'stamp', 'history', 'typical', 'Michener', 'style', 'perfectly', 'mini', 'series', 'format', 'elegiac', 'rather', 'just', 'epic.So', 'story', '26', 'hours', 'TV', 'beautiful', 'bend', 'river', 'home', 'tribe', 'native', 'Americans', 'then', 'trappers', 'then', 'traders', 'settlers', 'then', 'cattlemen', 'shepherds', 'farmers', 'civilization', 'hold', 'satisfying', 'times', 'informative', 'unraveling', 'American', 'history', 'told', 'factually', 'fictional', 'town', 'not', 'say', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'well', 'written', 'thanks', 'utterly', 'memorable', 'performances', 'like', 'Robert', 'Conrad', 'Pasquinel', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'cattle', 'driver', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'rancher', 'yes', 'even', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'McKeag', 'huge', 'cast', 'are', 'vignettes', 'will', 'stay', 'series', 'weakness', 'tendency', 'give', 'extended', 'unnecessary', 'flashbacks', 'particularly', 'later', 'where', 'director', 'continual', 'need', 'remind', 'length', 'what', 'gone', 'before', 'dating', 'could', 'be', 'argued', 'certainly', 'sound', 'quality', 'picture', 'are', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'now', 'whole', 'series', 'up', 'remarkably', 'well', 'paradoxically', 'later', 'modern', 'scenes', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'young', 'Sharon', 'Gless', 'have', 'dated', 'most', 'surprising', 'element', 'watching', 'again', 'first', 'time', '28', 'years', 'emphasis', 'harmony', 'land', 'give', 'take', 'early', 'settlers', 'achieved', 'later', 'generations', 'signally', 'failed', 'achieve.All', 'worthwhile', 'message', 'handy', 'historical', 'summary', 'fascinating', 'cast', 'collection', 'interesting', 'interweaving', 'stories', 'level', 'take', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'occasional', 'flaw']",N/A

Thank God for the just-announced DVD version, as my ancient off-the-TV VHS tapes have worn out. This should thrill Centennial's old fans and create many new ones. I hope that Universal has put the money, time and effort into a high-quality transfer to enhance the standard screen format; ditto for the Dolby soundtrack.Fun facts: The fictional town of Centennial is modern-day Greeley CO; Michener once taught at UNC there and returned to do research for his book. Many other sites, such as the Pawnee Buttes, retain their actual names... The massive production took almost a year to film around its many on-site locations. Grateful local businesses prospered... One of Centennial's oft-repeated scenes -- Lame Beaver's sun greeting -- was shot on top of Devil's Backbone, a large rock formation that was right in back of my parents' home in Loveland. My mother had a front row seat for it... Robert Conrad ran into some legal problems over some Pasquinal-like off-set behavior with locals. However, the other principals were quiet, polite and hardworking professionals both on and off the set.I recommend reading the book before viewing the miniseries, as it provides some important prehistoric and background information that the film had to leave out. However, the complex story line can be followed and understood better when seen rather than read about, as Michener often jumps around his time line. It's your choice as to which order to follow, but please do both to fully appreciate Centennial.

The fact that neither year nor location of this massacre were mentioned - I can only assume he was referring to Wounded Knee - bode ill for the portrayal of Native Americans in this film.Next, I was treated to an unctuous description of how the area we call Colorado today was formed. A few random animals were shown: eagle, beaver, rattlesnake, bison, and horses. No comment was made that there were no horses on the American continent until the Spaniards ""imported"" them.Twenty minutes into the first tape I had to stop watching because I found the way Native Americans are portrayed unbearable: The Arapaho wondering if a white man might be a god? In 1785? After Whites had been in the country for nearly 200 years? (Not to mention that, to the best of my knowledge, Plains Indians' religions did not include the concept of gods.)

Then the roof fell in and, sadly, the huge series slowly bogged down and made me remember why I stopped watching it back when it was an original TV series. By the end it had degenerated into a series of poorly-written speeches, sermons actually, designed to ""teach"" us rather than to entertain us. As a personal opinion, I always felt the same about Michener's books. They are overly-long and somewhere about page two or three hundred they slowly grow preachy and tedious. By the end you fine dyourself screaming, ""End! Please end!""As for the acting: Conrad's Pasquinel is great and perhaps his finest role (although I can't think of another that would distinguish him.) Richard Chamberlain, as Alexander McKeag, and most of the huge cast performed admirably. Another negative review said that Brian Keith's acting was laughable, although I feel he did the best he could, given the poor script. My personal favorite, though, was David Janssen, who's part was nothing more than a series of typical Janssen stoically delivered diatribes on how best to use ""The Land!"" His TV ""debate"" with the ""Bad Guy"" was so poorly-written I personally would have voted for the bad guy. Thankfully, he's in the last dismal hour or two and so I won't have to watch him again.Still, production values are obviously high and the DVD transfer is excellent on my Oppo 983 upconverter.It's just a shame that they didn't end it somewhere around hour ten or twelve. I'll watch it again but I'll do myself a favor and treat Pasquinel's death as the end of an otherwise fine production.The bottom-line is; Lonesome Dove has nothing to worry about.

Both shows have the same epic aura about them and the characters from each are equally unforgetable.  James Michner's history is fictionalized in Centennial but it is still better than McMurtry's.  Larry McMurtry is a great story teller but his playing fast and loose with facts gets a little hard to take.The story telling in Centennial is great through the first few episodes, but then they tend to get lost in their message and the later segments become predictable and preachy.  Reruns from earlier segments become overdone and eventually, annoying.

45898,A393ACL8T67DCM,0783215126,R. Hays,"[2, 2]","I was 12 years old when this movie played in the 70s.  Over all these years, I remembered only one part of the story.  The part of an Amish guy running away with an orphan girl, and how exciting their romance seemed to me.  And then her getting bit on the neck by a snake and dying.  And how sad I was for him.  Did not remember that the two actors were Gregory Harrison and Stepanie Zimbalist - actors I later knew in the 80s and 90s in other shows.  They seemed so young too.  But it was fun to see that segment of the story over again, and to recognize them now as two of my favorite actors.Well I'm in my mid 40s now, and for a couple years I was on the Amazon list to be notified when this movie was released on dvd.  It came about 10 days ago, but my decorative box was ripped.  Amazon sent another copy right away.  I want to mention that because I was very impressed at how fast they moved to address my complaint.When it arrived last Friday I had a dilemma.  I had sooo many things to do that weekend.  It was a choice of doing those things or watching the movie.  The movie won.  Ended the weekend with a sore backside from sitting so long, but it was worth it.I kind of see the movie as having 3 main periods.  The early period, the middle period, and the last episode that takes place in modern times.  My two favorite characters were played by Richard Chamberlain and Gregory Harrison.  Both were salt of the earth type characters.  I read someone else's opinion that Gregory Harrison was miscast.  Could not disagree with that more.  He played the part perfectly.  It was totally believable to me that his character would have won the respect and admiration of the Indians and settlers alike.I had a bunch of emotions watching the film.  Seeing the young people grow old, and then die (the movie covered roughly 200 years, and had many `main' characters), it gave me a feeling of how temporary our existence is here.  And how our lives can matter if we try to be people like McKeag (Chamberlain) or Levi Zendt (Harrison).  Or that our lives could be utterly wasted like Zendt's daughter Clemma's.  A tragic figure in the movie.  I guess it made me reflect on life in general.  And the sense of how our surroundings change over time.  My home town in Idaho, for example had only 9,000 people in it when we moved there in the 60s, but today has nearly 150,000.  It isn't the same place.  It isn't as special.  I sensed that in the movie too.  Clearly the area the movie took place in went downhill with the population increase.I liked that as a main character came onto the scene, we got to know him or her, and then experienced their death - and then there were other characters to move the story forward.  What I did not like is that that sense of closure with some of these characters was lost in the middle part of the movie.  What happened to Lucinda McKeag?  To her half sister Lisette?  Lisette's husband Mercy was a pretty central figure in the middle part of the movie, but after the trial over the Indian massacre, not a word about him?  What happened to the Zendt children?  We never found out how or in what way Charlotte passed on, and many of the others.  I realize there were many, many characters.  But it seems to me that there were a few too many flashbacks, and the flashbacks were far too long.  The flashbacks showed entire sequences from the earlier discs, and they could have used that time to give us more closure with some of the characters we all liked so much.  I mean, suddenly it was the 1970's and all those great characters were now dead for several decades, and we don't know their endings.  That part I did not like.But regardless, the movie has to be one of the greatest films in history.  And when you find yourself having such a great time getting into a story - you don't want it to end.  With most movies you get 2, maybe 3 hours.  But with this one - 26 hours!

I wish other studios were as diligent and professional in maintaining the quality of the original as we have here in Centennial.  The sound is adequate.  This series was a major television event in 1978, but has suffered some with age.  The acting ranges from great to bad.  The fault is not necessarily the actors'.  The screenplay and direction are the problems.  The quality drops off sharply in the last two or three disks.  During the final episodes the director(s) seem obsessed with flashbacks.  If the series was originally aired weekly, perhaps this made more sense.  But when you are going through the series every night or every other night, they are totally unnecessary and sometimes entirely irrelevant.  They are long, and drag the current theme almost to a halt.  In fact, in the last disk, there are three flashbacks that are repeated in the same episode.  Also, during the last few disks, there are long monologues dealing with the issues of racism and the environment.  These are critical and appropriate themes to address during the series, especially with respect to the mistreatment of Indians and Mexicans in Colorado.  But this could have been handled much more convincingly/effectively than delivering the message in the form of ""sermons.""  Overall this was a good series.

Cain ""writer""","[12, 12]","I've grown up with this miniseries--first as a cassette tape my mother filled with dialogue and music from the show, then as a badly taped version from TNT, and finally as the gorgeous box set.  This miniseries largely shaped my strong views about Native Americans, including the way white settlers treated them, the muddled policies the US government held concerning them, and the shame of the degraded lifestyle forced on many of them today.As other reviewers have stated, the history in this miniseries is impeccable, including many real-life parallels (and I felt vindicated when, as a junior in college, I finally was taught the real story of the Chivington Massacre at Sand Creek).  The best thing about this is the way the writers and actors take real history (which to many often seems dry) and turns it into stories that make modern-day viewers laugh, cry, and shout with outrage.The cast is full of stars like Richard Chamberlain, Robert Conrad, Lynn Redgrave, Brian Keith, Dennis Weaver, and many many more.  I can't think of a single performance that was in any way lacking.  From the fur traders to the Native Americans, to the ranchers and farmers, to the swindlers and immigrants, who made Colorado their home, these characters shine.All it takes is a single strain of one of the memorable music themes to bring back vivid memories of the miniseries, and watching even a single episode is guaranteed to fill me with the wanderlust to go west, a yearning for the lost past, a homesickness for this place that feels like home to me--Centennial, Colorado, and the areas near the town.If you're an historian, if you're a westerner, if you're like me and just wish you were a westerner, if you're interested in Native American history, or if you just like a good epic that will make you laugh and cry, pick up this miniseries.

45935,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,0783215126,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[2, 2]","This is a rerelease of the ground breaking TV series from America that was originally shown in 1978. It was a really faithful adaptation of the best selling book of the same name by James A. Michener, who actually does an introduction. It tells of the story of the founding of a town that is the Centennial in the title and in so doing to tell in microcosm some of the events that helped shaped his nation.It charts over 200 years of American history using the many characters to tell the story through their experiences. Starting in the late Eighteenth Century we first meet Pasquinelle, a French trapper who started trading with various Indian tribes like the Arapaho. He uses brawn, brain and guts to overcome the many barriers he must face and also marries one of his new Native American friends - Clay basket (great name) and saves a Scottish Trapper McKeeg (Richard Chamberlain doing a worse Scots accent than Mr Gibson did in `Braveheart') . What follows from the progeny is a tale of love from the daughters and hate from the half breed sons, who follow the Indian path which ultimately leads to war in a futile attempt to protect their land from the ever encroaching and greedy white settlers.This is a 26 hour long production set in 12 episodes which are all in fact self contained films in their own right, and I found them to be ruddy addictive. With a cast of thousands that includes Raymond Burr, Donald Pleasance, Lynne Redgrave, Timothy Dalton, Dennis Weaver, Robert Vaughn, Sharon Gless, and a very young George Clooney who I actually missed, and has over 100 speaking parts this was a massive undertaking they had four directors and five cinematographers, which often can be seen as in `How The West Was Won', but this is completely intact, the style and narrative flow beautifully until we hit the twentieth Century where things sort of speed up.On the way we get massacres, revolution, search for gold, inter racial marriage, bible bashing, cattle drives, Indian attacks, night rider attacks, sheep droving, darned farmers putting up fences and the brutal story of a nations progress with the concomitant shame that comes from a misplaced population. There is even a bar room brawl and a Wild West show as well as the tragedy of the dust bowl. This then is what the word epic was coined for, and it keeps the action coming as fast as both the joys and tragedy, to be anything other than impressed is to be bordering on churlish.But hey ho I am going to point out some of the flaws - small though they are we still have them and that is that this is a faithful reprint from the original series and as such we get the full titles for every episode and they last for over three minutes. The sound quality varies in places requiring the remote to be handy, the make up for the ageing process of some of the characters was a bit am dram and the most annoying is the clip show element that appears in the last few episodes. That is where people stand around reminiscing and we get treated to often a lengthy clip from one or more previous episodes. This device was used in `Roots' a lot too and can become really annoying, but as these were often shown a week apart it was probably needed to remind the viewer of what had transpired.That said it wears its educational, ecological and humanitarian heart on its sleeve, the issues and associated values are still valid today, whether it be the displaced Indian Nations, the slaughter of natures bounty or the greed that destroys everything - the land included. Because of the above issues I was going to award 4 stars but I absolutely loved this and it was only towards the end that I realised I had seen it first time round ( I remembered `The Winds of Death') but it has not lost any of its power.

45945,AP3B615GM191G,0783215126,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","Most entertainment material is separated into two categories...fiction and non-fiction.  Either the story is basically true, or comes straight from the imagination of the mind conceiving it.  However, author James Michener (whose epic novel this TV series was based on) introduced the public (or at least perfected the genre) to a new kind of entertainment: Historical fiction.  In this type of story-telling, the characters themselves may not be real, but (after careful and much-absorbing research) the places, events, and stories they become involved in could very well have happened.  Essentially, it is a telling of history through stories based on detailed research of a certain historical era.Centennial focuses on the development of the American West.  From fur trappers and traders Pasquinel and McQueg, to the Indian Wars fought by ruthless men like Col. Skimmerhorn, to the settling of the West (thanks to settlers like Levi Zendt, farmers like Hans ""Potatoes"" Broombaugh and cattlemen like R.J. Poteet and Jim Lloyd), and finally to the present-day, this TV miniseries follows the development of the American West in a way that very likely transpired.  The names are all fictional, of course, but you will easily find yourself wrapped up in the stories of the types of men and women who braved the New Frontier.To review all 20+ hours of this epic series would be a monumental task, but suffice it to say that each new ""episode"" brings with it a new and interesting perspective as the West chronologically moves forward.  Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the whole series, though, is how each part harkens back to the one before it in order to create a chain of events.  It's not just one story followed by another...each tale both naturally springs forth from the one preceding it, as well as leads into the next tale.  For example, even in the final part of the show set in modern-day ""Centennial"", the influence of such names as Pasquinel, Lloyd, and Wendell (among others) is just as strong as ever despite those characters having been dead and buried for many years.About the only negative aspect of the series is that it loses a bit of its incredible momentum toward the later episodes.  Whether that is due to the Pasquinel/McQueg story arc being probably Michener's most inspired work (so nothing can live up to that original story), or the fact that the show underwent severe production changes after the first few episodes is unknown, but even then it is still very watchable.Thus, I highly recommend this series to any student of history (or those who want to become one!) for its ability to show with reasonable certainty what the American West once looked like.  You are almost sure to become endeared to many of the show's classic characters, as they are all very well-acted and bring something a bit different to the table, each and every one.  It might take you a while to get through this collection, but I assure you that it is well worth the time spent...in fact, you may even be wishing for more!",5,Introduces A New Genre To Televison: Historical Fiction,1258329600,"11 16, 2009",2009,3033,"['Most', 'entertainment', 'material', 'separated', 'two', 'categories', 'fiction', 'non-fiction', 'story', 'basically', 'true', 'straight', 'imagination', 'mind', 'conceiving', 'However', 'author', 'James', 'Michener', 'epic', 'novel', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'based', 'introduced', 'public', 'least', 'perfected', 'genre', 'new', 'kind', 'entertainment', 'Historical', 'fiction', 'type', 'story-telling', 'characters', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'real', 'careful', 'much-absorbing', 'research', 'places', 'events', 'stories', 'become', 'involved', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'happened', 'Essentially', 'telling', 'history', 'stories', 'based', 'detailed', 'research', 'certain', 'historical', 'era.Centennial', 'focuses', 'development', 'American', 'West', 'fur', 'trappers', 'traders', 'Pasquinel', 'McQueg', 'Indian', 'Wars', 'fought', 'ruthless', 'men', 'Col.', 'Skimmerhorn', 'settling', 'West', 'thanks', 'settlers', 'Levi', 'Zendt', 'farmers', 'Hans', 'Potatoes', 'Broombaugh', 'cattlemen', 'R.J.', 'Poteet', 'Jim', 'Lloyd', 'finally', 'present-day', 'TV', 'development', 'American', 'West', 'way', 'very', 'likely', 'transpired', 'names', 'are', 'fictional', 'course', 'will', 'easily', 'find', 'wrapped', 'up', 'stories', 'types', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'braved', 'New', 'Frontier.To', 'review', '20+', 'hours', 'epic', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'monumental', 'task', 'say', 'new', 'episode', 'new', 'interesting', 'perspective', 'West', 'chronologically', 'forward', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'intriguing', 'aspect', 'whole', 'series', 'how', 'part', 'back', 'one', 'order', 'create', 'chain', 'events', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'story', 'followed', 'tale', 'naturally', 'springs', 'forth', 'one', 'preceding', 'as', 'well', 'leads', 'next', 'tale', 'example', 'even', 'final', 'part', 'show', 'set', 'modern-day', 'Centennial', 'influence', 'such', 'names', 'Pasquinel', 'Lloyd', 'Wendell', 'others', 'just', 'as', 'strong', 'ever', 'characters', 'having', 'been', 'dead', 'buried', 'many', 'years.About', 'only', 'negative', 'aspect', 'series', 'bit', 'incredible', 'momentum', 'later', 'episodes', 'due', 'Pasquinel/McQueg', 'story', 'arc', 'being', 'probably', 'Michener', 'most', 'inspired', 'work', 'nothing', 'can', 'live', 'up', 'original', 'story', 'fact', 'show', 'underwent', 'severe', 'production', 'changes', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'unknown', 'even', 'then', 'still', 'very', 'watchable.Thus', 'highly', 'recommend', 'series', 'student', 'history', 'who', 'want', 'become', 'one', 'ability', 'show', 'reasonable', 'certainty', 'what', 'American', 'West', 'once', 'looked', 'are', 'almost', 'sure', 'become', 'endeared', 'many', 'show', 'classic', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'well-acted', 'bring', 'something', 'bit', 'different', 'table', 'one', 'might', 'take', 'while', 'get', 'collection', 'assure', 'well', 'time', 'spent', 'fact', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'wishing', 'more']",N/A
