914534,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B0009WFF6S,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[153, 167]","There was much talk and debate over Gilmore Girls' fourth season. Some thought it was great and that it was one of their best seasons. Others thought that it had a lot of good stuff, but had problems and was, quite easily, it's weakest season. I can't say that it's a bad season, because it's not. The second half contains some truly great episodes, but season four was a disjointed disappointment. The show went through a transition this year, and shows that go through a certain 'growing up' phase do have some problems. They usually don't go through it unscathed. Season four of GG is no exception. Rory leaves home and Stars Hollow and goes off to live in her dorm at Yale. This leaves a new, and awkward, dynamic between mother and daughter and the show. The relationship between the two was a major factor of the series, and the fact that they spoke to one another on cell phones more than anything else it seemed was also a component that didn't add to the season. They added in the character of Jason 'Digger' Stiles, and most people didn't really like him or warm up to him. This was not actor Chris Eigelman's fault, as he was good. The only actor who could match Lauren Graham's rapid speak and quick wit. Lorelei also had new developments in her life. She and Sookie were getting serious about opening their own inn, and in the meantime, take on careers as caterers. It seemed that the writers had a hard time settling into their new set ups and situations, and it left the show disjointed, misguided, and just not the same show. This was mostly during the first half of the season, although there were some highlights. ""Chicken Or Beef"" was a classic GG episode dealing with Rory running into ex Dean, who invites her to his upcoming wedding. ""The Festival Of Living Art"" was another notable episode, with the town becoming living pieces of art in the town square. But there were more misfires and duds than great eps. ""An Affair To Remember"" had Rory spending the entire episode looking for a place to study. This was a problem with Rory. There was this big new change in her world, and the writers didn't seem to exploit it much. Rory was lost for a good portion of the season, and it seemed they couldn't figure anything good to do with her. Thankfully, once the second half kicks in, the show regains it's footing and the writers seemed to have finally gotten a hold of what the show wa doing this season. The second half really kicked into gear, and it's what saved the season. This is why I gave it four stars. Jess returns, and not for the good, in ""A Family Matter"", and the season had one of it's best episodes with ""A Clang In The Clamor"", a classic GG episode with a wonderful Luke/Lorelei moment in the old church. ""Tick..Tick..Tick..Boom"" and ""Afterboom"" was a tremendous two parter. A true season highlight. Lorelei and Sookie's new inn, The Dragonfly, is coming into shape towards the end of the season, and it appears to be a great new place. ""Luke Can See Her Face"" is a great episode. It's a pivotal ep in the L/L movement, when Luke finally realizes that Lorelei is the one. The season finale, ""Raincoats And Recipes"", is the type of stuff season finales are made off. Pitch perfect. An episode that changes everything in the Gilmores' world, and promises great stuff to come. And come it did in the show's magnificent fifth season. Season four was not bad. It had problems and flaws, and is easily it's 'least' season, but it overcame them in the second half. Ther performances were still up to snuff, and Lauren Graham continues to be one of the top best actresses on TV. She has ""Emmy"" written all over her, and continues to be denied that honor. Yes, moving out and moving away can be awkward and things are just different. Maybe that was the writers' point, but it was obvious that it's hard, different, and awkward to write as well. Season 4 started off with a whimper, but it sure ended with a major bang.",4,Growing Pains,1121990400,"07 22, 2005",2005,3944,"['was', 'much', 'talk', 'debate', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'fourth', 'season', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'seasons', 'Others', 'thought', 'had', 'lot', 'good', 'stuff', 'had', 'problems', 'was', 'quite', 'easily', 'weakest', 'season', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'bad', 'season', 'not', 'second', 'half', 'truly', 'great', 'episodes', 'season', 'four', 'was', 'disjointed', 'disappointment', 'show', 'went', 'transition', 'year', 'go', 'certain', ""'growing"", 'up', 'phase', 'do', 'have', 'problems', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'unscathed', 'Season', 'four', 'GG', 'exception', 'Rory', 'home', 'Stars', 'Hollow', 'off', 'live', 'dorm', 'Yale', 'new', 'awkward', 'dynamic', 'mother', 'daughter', 'show', 'relationship', 'two', 'was', 'major', 'factor', 'series', 'fact', 'spoke', 'one', 'cell', 'phones', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'seemed', 'was', 'also', 'component', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'season', 'added', 'character', 'Jason', ""'Digger"", 'Stiles', 'most', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'warm', 'up', 'was', 'not', 'actor', 'Chris', 'Eigelman', 'fault', 'was', 'good', 'only', 'actor', 'who', 'could', 'match', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'rapid', 'speak', 'quick', 'wit', 'Lorelei', 'also', 'had', 'new', 'developments', 'life', 'Sookie', 'were', 'getting', 'serious', 'opening', 'own', 'inn', 'meantime', 'take', 'careers', 'caterers', 'seemed', 'writers', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'settling', 'new', 'set', 'ups', 'situations', 'left', 'show', 'disjointed', 'misguided', 'just', 'not', 'same', 'show', 'was', 'mostly', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'were', 'highlights', 'Chicken', 'Or', 'Beef', 'was', 'classic', 'GG', 'episode', 'dealing', 'Rory', 'running', 'ex', 'Dean', 'who', 'upcoming', 'wedding', 'Festival', 'Living', 'Art', 'was', 'notable', 'episode', 'town', 'becoming', 'living', 'pieces', 'art', 'town', 'square', 'were', 'more', 'misfires', 'duds', 'great', 'eps', 'Affair', 'Remember', 'had', 'Rory', 'spending', 'entire', 'episode', 'looking', 'place', 'study', 'was', 'problem', 'Rory', 'was', 'big', 'new', 'change', 'world', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'exploit', 'much', 'Rory', 'was', 'lost', 'good', 'portion', 'season', 'seemed', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'anything', 'good', 'do', 'Thankfully', 'once', 'second', 'half', 'kicks', 'show', 'footing', 'writers', 'seemed', 'have', 'finally', 'gotten', 'hold', 'what', 'show', 'doing', 'season', 'second', 'half', 'really', 'kicked', 'gear', 'what', 'saved', 'season', 'why', 'gave', 'four', 'stars', 'Jess', 'returns', 'not', 'good', 'A', 'Family', 'Matter', 'season', 'had', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', 'A', 'Clang', 'Clamor', 'classic', 'GG', 'episode', 'wonderful', 'Luke/Lorelei', 'moment', 'old', 'church', 'Tick..Tick..Tick..Boom', 'Afterboom', 'was', 'tremendous', 'two', 'parter', 'true', 'season', 'highlight', 'Lorelei', 'Sookie', 'new', 'inn', 'Dragonfly', 'coming', 'shape', 'end', 'season', 'be', 'great', 'new', 'place', 'Luke', 'Can', 'See', 'Face', 'great', 'episode', 'pivotal', 'ep', 'L/L', 'movement', 'when', 'Luke', 'finally', 'Lorelei', 'one', 'season', 'finale', 'Raincoats', 'Recipes', 'type', 'stuff', 'season', 'finales', 'are', 'made', 'off', 'Pitch', 'perfect', 'episode', 'everything', 'Gilmores', 'world', 'great', 'stuff', 'come', 'come', 'did', 'show', 'magnificent', 'fifth', 'season', 'Season', 'four', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'had', 'problems', 'flaws', 'easily', 'season', 'second', 'half', 'performances', 'were', 'still', 'up', 'snuff', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'be', 'one', 'top', 'best', 'actresses', 'TV', 'Emmy', 'written', 'be', 'denied', 'honor', 'Yes', 'moving', 'out', 'moving', 'away', 'can', 'be', 'awkward', 'things', 'are', 'just', 'different', 'Maybe', 'was', 'writers', 'point', 'was', 'obvious', 'hard', 'different', 'awkward', 'write', 'as', 'well', 'Season', '4', 'started', 'off', 'whimper', 'sure', 'ended', 'major', 'bang']",N/A

In fact, the show is the first script supported by the Family Friendly Forum's script development fund to go on and become a regular television series. Part of an initiative between The WB Network - maker of such hits as Dawson's Creek (1998), Felicity (1998), Angel (1999), and Smallville (2001) - and fellow industry executives, this push for more family-oriented programming resulted in a series showcasing a unique mother-daughter bond and the various people they encounter on their life voyage of discovery. Set in the fictional town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut, Gilmore Girls utilizes many of the same sets as the hit series The Dukes Of Hazzard (1979) - another successful Warner Brothers production from years past...Gilmore Girls is set in a small idyllic community in Connecticut filled with a wide range of diverse characters and eccentric personalities. Against this backdrop, Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) attempts to raise her daughter and best friend, Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel), to carve out a better life for herself. Having made a number of youthful mistakes, Lorelai made the decision to raise her daughter by herself at a young age (the same age as Rory when the series begins), and she's bound and determined to make sure that Rory makes better decisions for herself. As Rory prepares to go off to college, she displays many of the same likes and dislikes as her mother - especially when it comes to the opposite sex, and that's what worries Lorelai the most... A borderline soap opera, Gilmore Girls is more of a serial drama that focuses on the love, friendship, and shared growth of a mother and daughter as they live out their dreams in modern day America...The Gilmore Girls (Season 4) DVD features a number of touching episodes including the season premiere ""Ballrooms and Biscotti"" in which Lorelai and Rory return from their European vacation to experience a whirlwind of activity. Taylor gets upset when Rory declines the offer to be the Stars Hollow Ice Cream Queen, while Rory herself is in a panic after realizing she wrote the wrong date for freshman orientation on her calendar. Now, she must fit a week's worth of preparation into two days, and Emily isn't very happy about it... Other notable episodes from Season 4 include ""The Nanny and the Professor"" in which Rory becomes concerned when Paris's new boyfriend turns out to be one of her college professors, and ""Luke Can See Her Face"" in which a self-help tape and a long talk with Jess help Luke to envision a path to the relationship he's been seeking all along...Below is a list of episodes included on the Gilmore

The season started off slowly, as the writers struggled to find interesting plotlines for Rory and Lorelai as they lived separately for the first time.Rory began her education at Yale and Lorelai looked for odd jobs as the Dragonfly was undergoing construction. Rory's experiences at Yale started off by being pretty boring (i.e. looking for the perfect tree to sit under) but the writers eventually built an exciting community of new characters for Rory to interact with and for viewers to enjoy. Lorelai's plotline gets interesting when she meets Jason, someone who works for her father. Thier secret dating is quite hysterical to watch. I also liked how this season focussed on the grandparents as they are some of the finest actors on television. It was interesting to watch their relationship weaken. Other highlights: Lane starts getting serious with her band and Sookie finds out what it's like to be a mom!As the season progressed, it got stronger and stronger, finishing with the best finale in Gilmore Girls history. The season four finale, Raincoats and Recipes, is one of the best episodes of Gilmore Girls yet. The Dragonfly opening, Rory & Dean's adulterous mistake, and the Gilmore Girls experiencing the first major fracture in their once unbreakable bond.

They share a love for breathless quip-filled conversation and coffee, frequenting Luke's Diner in the downtown of Stars Hollow, their fictitious Connecticut suburb.In Season 1, 16-year-old Rory decides she wants to transfer from the public high school to Chilton, a ritzy private school in Hartford. To make it happen, Lorelai has to make the ultimate sacrifice -- beseech her parents Richard and Emily, with whom she hasn't been on good terms since she announced her teenage pregnancy. Although estranged with Lorelai, the elder Gilmores are more than eager to accept their young granddaughter into their lives. They agree to foot the bill -- on one condition. Both Lorelai and Rory must attend dinner at the elder Gilmores' home every Friday evening.Reluctantly, Lorelai agrees. The resulting Friday night dinners set the stage for much hilarity and snark -- as well as the occasional glimpse into the Gilmores' sad past, hinting at everything that went wrong in their relationship, well before Rory's birth.Also seen on the show are diner proprietor Luke, a quiet, loyal friend to both mother and daughter with a building crush on Lorelai; Lane, the Korean-American daughter of a stern single mother and Rory's best friend; Sookie, chef at the Independence Inn, which Lorelai manages; Kirk, a quirky ""townie"" who mysteriously shows up everywhere anyone's doing anything; dance instructor and romance expert Miss Patty; and many others. Rory's father Christopher is also around sporadically, as he and Lorelai fight an attraction which has intertwined throughout their lives, but never seems to work out.In this season, Rory becomes a freshman at Yale, while Lorelai and Sookie realize their lifelong dream of opening their own inn. Rory's ex-boyfriend Dean is hired to work on the construction, and Rory's discomfort is increased when she's invited to his wedding. Lorelai dates a colleague of her father's, and Sookie gives birth to son Davey.Although the show is supposedly set in Connecticut, the writers and producers never really make that believable to a native (i.e. Rory and Lorelai walking around with thin coats, wide open, supposedly in the middle of winter. Still, I can overlook that -- it's fun having one of my favorite shows set in my own state.

Both Rory and Lorelai are dealing with life-changing circumstances...and for the most part they must figure out a way to do it alone. Furthermore, Mr. And Mrs. Gilmore's marriage has reached a stalemate, and they have to decide whether or not they even like each other anymore. Lane moves out of her chastity belt of a house, and Luke closes the chapter of his married life...only to open new doors on a relationship he has really always wanted!By far the best part of the season, ( I have to agree with other reviewers) is the Luke and Lorelai dynamic, I to this day think they have the best on-screen chemistry in television.Much of the season is heartbreaking and like watching a train-wreck where you really can't stop what is the inevitable...growing pains for Rory as she is forced to confront the consequences of decisions made in Season 3....nonetheless the season ends in a huge bang, it will leave you both smiling and questioning.Perhaps I have made Season 4 sound a little too dramatic, it is important to know that all the same qualities you find in the previous GG season still pertain to this season in many ways, the show is wittier, funnier, and sarcastic as ever.

Bernabo,"[6, 7]","The fourth season of ""Gilmore Girls"" is my least favorite season of the WB television dramedy to date and in watching the episodes again I figured out why this is the case.  It is not just that the dynamic is totally different with Rory away at Yale while Lorelia remains in Stars Hollow.  That was the situation in the fifth season and I enjoyed that one, which is what led me to the conclusion that what I did not like about season four was that, on balance, it was so unsatisfying.  What Amy Sherman-Palladino has the Gilmore girls doing in the 2003-2004 season is essentially tread water.  Keep in mind what happened in the season finale from the previous year, ""Those Are Strings, Pinocchio,"" when Luke had the dream about Lorelia asking him not to go on the cruise with Nicole, which created a nice bookend with the third season premier, ""Those Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days,"" when Lorelia had the dream about Luke.  Clearly something is being set up for the fourth season, but the payoff is deterred until the very end, at which point we have good news with Lorelia and bad news with Rory.All you have to do is look at the carcasses of romantic comedies that died when the bickering couples consummated their love (with ""Moonlighting"" as the North Star in that particular constellation) to appreciate Sherman-Palladino's concern that she not kill the fatted calf with the love affair between Luke and Lorelia.  The proof that she knew what she was doing is found in the current season, where the characters have found a way of fighting that never seems like it puts the relationship in danger.  They are comfortable enough with each other to fight without it being counter productive, so it was worth it to get to emotional season five cliffhanger.  But living through season four was sheer agony for those of us who have been waiting for those two to finally get together.First, Lorelia gets back from the European trip with Rory to discover that Luke went on the cruise, got drunk, married Nicole, and now wants a divorce (""Ballrooms and Biscotti"").  But getting a divorce proves to be a headache, so Luke and Nicole start dating (""Die, Jerk""), then move in together (""In the Clamor and the Clangor""), and the ups and downs of the relationship keep Luke busy, albeit mainly offstage.  Second, when Richard takes on a new business partner, Jason ""Digger"" Styles turns out to be a blast from Lorelia's past (""The Hobbit, the Sofa, and Digger Stiles"").  For once Lorelia has met somebody who can keep up with her sharp tongue and the next thing she knows she and Jason are dating (""Ted Koppel's Big Night Out"") and hiding the relationship from her parents at her insistence until the whole thing explodes in her face (""Tick, Tick, Tick, Boom!"").  In retrospect I found myself realizing that Jason did not replace Luke or Max in Lorelia's life, but Rory.  With her daughter away at college, Jason was the one that Lorelia had the high-speed verbal battles resplendent with pop culture references and assorted nonsequiters.As for Rory, her character is also swimming in place while trying to find her footing at Yale.  The main problem is that since the whole point of Rory's existence from episode one was to get her into Harvard once she goes to college, even if it is a different Ivy League school, the character needs a new direction.  Rory wants to be a journalist, but writing for the Yale newspaper is not exactly that big of a challenge for our girl (""Die, Jerk"").  Paris continues to confound Rory's life with everything from a crafts corner (""The Lorelias' First Day at Yale"") and an affair with Professor Asher Fleming (""The Nanny and the Professor"") to a memorable first kiss on Spring Break (""Girls in Bikinis, Boys Doin' the Twist,"" a.k.a. ""Gilmore Girls Gone Wild"").  Meanwhile, Rory's dating life at Yale is almost nonexistent and even with the return of Jess (""A Family Matter""), she keeps running into Dean and his troubled marriage until the inevitable happens (""Raincoats and Recipes"").  But the next year it becomes clear Rory was only treading water as well.The other thing that keeps Lorelia busy while Rory is away and occupied while waiting for Luke to see her face (""Luke Can See Her Face"") is the renovation of the Dragonfly Inn.  Ultimately it is the inn that defines the story arc of the fourth season since the test run for the Dragonfly not only ends the year but gives us the fateful moment when Luke and Lorelia agree they are dating (""Raincoats and Recipes"").  Of course, this great leap forward for Luke and Lorelia is followed by Rory entering a whole new world of her own, which really deflates the other big moment because we know nothing good will come of it (as the fifth season will prove in time).Once your focus in on Luke and Lorelia you can see how everything else that happens in the fourth season is just an excuse to keep them apart.  This includes everything from Sookie's baby (""The Festival of Living Art"") and the funeral of Lorelia the first (""The Reigning Lorelia"") to Liz and T.J.'s wedding (""Last Week Fights, This Week Tights"") and Emily moving out of the Gilmore mansion (""Afterboom"").  One of the DVD extras is ""Who Wants to Get Together,"" a montage of the season's most romantic moments, but that only underscores that nothing was as good as the final episode.  There are only additional scenes for two episodes (ironically for a show where everybody talks fast the writers rarely overwrite episodes) and only on-screen factoids for one episode.  Throw in the Stars Hollow Challenge trivia game and the pop culture reference guide and the DVD extras are decent enough.  But obviously we keep coming back for the main course, even if that means more Friday night dinners.",4,"Lorelia and Rory are treading water in the fourth season of ""Gilmore Girls""",1129248000,"10

914565,A1BBT9XLKQDV81,B0009WFF6S,"N8 ""Buffy is Queen!!""","[10, 17]","This really is the worst season of the Gilmore girls.  I watched all 22 episodes in 4 days because I just needed to get through it and move on.  Storywise, the plot is okay...the season is just extremely irritating and not funny at all compared to every other Gilmore season.  I went a solid 10 episodes without laughing, let alone cracking a smile.  These people are supposed to be funny.  That's why they are so enjoyable.  They are funny and fun, regardless of what positive or negative events are taking place in their lives.  Season 4 apparently forgot that.For starters, Jason, Lorelai's boyfriend is hideous.  There is nothing likeable about the guy.  He's basically a rich, pretentious jerk who is so concerned with his own well being that he doesn't even let Lorelai sleep next to him in bed.  What kind of boyfriend honestly says, ""get out of my bed and go sleep in the guest room?""  Not a very good boyfriend.  Also, his relationship with Lorelai just makes no sense.  They don't seem to enjoy anything other than having sex, and really, that's all I see their relationship as being:  a physical attraction.  Even this makes no sense to me because Jason's scraggly, ugly beard makes him the least physically desireable person Lorelai has ever been with.  Also, for someone who strongly hates the lifestyle her parents live,  it makes no sense for Lorelai to even date Jason because he's basically a younger, less desirable version of her father.In terms of relationships, Luke's ""marriage"" is also just the most ridiculous thing of all time.  It was obvious that they needed someway to keep Luke and Lorelai from getting together until the finale of season 4 so they just invented these ridiculous relationships to keep Luke and Lorelai apart until the finale.  Luke's marriage was equally as disturbing as Lorelai's ""relationship"" with Jason simply because it was never real.  It was just a stupid dramatic thing the show's writers did to annoy the fans in my opinion.The entire cast this season just seemed like a bunch of whiny cry-babies who never got their way and so they decided to just cry about it.  Nobody has a spine, nobody has any fun, and if everything doesn't go perfectly well then they all just want to quit.  It's ridiculous.  And Rory is the epitome of a spoiled rich little brat.  She defines the Harvard stereotype she thinks she isn't by declaring that the still married Dean is ""my Dean.""  He's not her Dean, he's married!  For Rory to so blindly believe this, and not even think that there was anything wrong with her action was completely appaling.  Rory will forever be known as ""Whory"" as far as I'm concerned.  I don't care how sorry she feels at the start of Season 5.  What she did was wrong and selfish, and she thought she had a right to do it.  It was messed up.This season was just no fun.  I could keep going and going but it would be pointless.  Only watch this season because it contains some key plot development points for the show.

914568,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B0009WFF6S,P Magnum,"[4, 7]","The fourth season of the WB's Gilmore Girls started slowly, but ended up as one the shows best seasons.  The season starts with Lorelei (Lauren Graham) & Rory (Alexis Bledel) returning from their summer in Europe and getting ready for Rory to go off to Yale.  Once at Yale, Rory gets homesick and leans on Lorelei for help and Lorelei shows up at Yale to help ease into her new life.  Throughout the season, Lorelei ends up secretly dating her father's (the great Edward Hermann) new business partner Jason Stiles (Christopher Eigeman).  The romance doesn't across as Ms. Graham and Mr. Eigeman don't seem like a match, but it sets the stage for one of two season ending cliffhangers.  Luke (Scott Patterson) finally admits to himself what everyone else knows: he is in love with Lorelei. He uncharacteristically gets a self-help tape and the scenes where he is listening to it are amongst the funniest of the season.  The season also finds Dean (Jared Padalecki) returning to Rory's life and construction begins on Lorelei & Sookie's (Melissa McCarthy) inn, The Dragonfly.  One of the season's best scenes occurs when Lorelei and Rory breakdown in the arms of Luke and Dean when both their worlds seem to be crumbling down as Lorelei is sinking into financial ruin with the inn and Rory is advised to drop a class and can't keep up with the demands of Yale.  The season ends with Luke and Lorelei kissing and then Lorelei finding out that Rory and Dean slept together.

Add to that the ridiculous teenage marriage (of Rory's first love, Dean) the ratings push girl on girl kiss (by Rory and Paris in ""Girls in Bikinis, Boys Doin' the Twist"") and the unwelcome character re-appearance (by the malevolent Jess in ""A Family Matter"").Some of the episodes were lackluster (The Hobbit, the Sofa and Digger Stiles) and some of the new characters were vomitously quirky (Digger Stiles), but the finale - and the fan reaction to it (Raincoats and Recipes) made up for the lows. Watching Rory take up a doomed, adulterous relationship with Dean at the same time Lorelai starts a balanced, anticipated relationship with Luke was a wonderful and long awaited study of contrasts. You cringed when you saw the first, cheered when you saw the second and were left waiting until the following season for more.It was much good, much bad but still much better than most of what's being done on other networks in inferior, ratings blessed shows. Lauren Graham, Scott Patterson, Kelly Bishop and Edward Herrmann have unfairly been overlooked by the Emmys, but fans of the show continue to watch, despite complaining, just to see these characters continue to enchant and cajole. Alexis Bledel, who I've never thought of as a strong actress, did some of her best work in this season as she showed Rory's resilient stubbornness, even as she struggled with her self-indulgent entitlement.

914572,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0009WFF6S,Robert Moore,"[11, 13]","There are widely diverging opinions about Season Four of THE GILMORE GIRLS, and the reason is pretty easy to spot:  it departs sharply from the previous three seasons and strikes out in entirely new directions.  It would be wrong to say that everything had changed, but an extraordinarily large number of things did.  The short list of major changes would include:  Rory has moved to New Haven (22.5 miles north of the fictional Stars Hollow--north because this is the only place it would be close enough for the kinds of commutes to Hartford people are always making) and has started her freshmen year at Yale; Rory has no boyfriend for the entire year, while Lorelai is dating her father's new business partner; for the entire season Lorelai, Sookie, and Michel are inn-less, but are instead in the process of restoring the Dragonfly Inn; Dean gets married, though not very successfully; Sookie and Jackson have their baby while the elder Lorelai dies; Lane is forced to move out when her mother discovers her large cache of rock CDs, her membership in a band, and her unwillingness to attend the Adventist college any longer; and Kirk--yes, Kirk--gets a girlfriend.  Only a few of these changes would have been sufficient to alter the tone of the show, but together they create a completely new atmosphere and feel.By far the biggest change is Rory's going to Yale, where she does both better and worse than she had hoped.  She lives her first year in an impossibly large suite of rooms with Paris Geller, along with two other girls.  Paris spends her freshman year having an affair with a distinguished sixty-year-old professor played by Michael York, while Rory spends much of her time traveling back to Stars Hollow.  My one real complaint with the show is that ""Yale"" is merely a set that they manage to keep recycling for the various parts of the university.  In the entire season, there is one and only one actual shot of the real Yale, a lone shot of the eastern entrance to Old Campus and the building that houses the Classics department.  What baffles me is why they used only this one shot and even then only once.  Was it stock footage they found somewhere?  If they actually sent a camera there, why not get shots of the New Haven Commons or the Beinecke Library or Woolsey or Sterling Library or Harkness?  Or a shot of any of the colleges would have been nice.  OK, I digress, but it would have been nice to see some effort to create an illusion.I personally like to see shows develop and change, so the alterations in the show didn't bother me very much.  My own belief is that shows must evolve over time or become stale and die.  I am delighted that this was not the case for THE GILMORE GIRLS.  There was a genuine intent on the part of the producers of the show to keep the show alive.  I found most, though not all (I really didn't care for the character of Jason Stiles and especially his relationship with Lorelai), of the plot lines to be interesting and fun, and welcomed Kirk's increased role in the show.  He has evolved from being a mere bit player in Season One to being one of the regulars.  My favorite subplot was probably that dealing with Lane, with her band moving to new levels of success, and her expulsion from her home for not being a very good Adventist.  Her Season Three near-boyfriend Dave Rygalski left the show when actor Adam Brody transformed into Seth Cohen on THE O.C., and his guitar was replaced by former Skid Row member Sebastian Bach.  I loved the way that Bach didn't really fit into the band easily because of his being so much older than the others, but his having guitar chops vastly beyond the quality of the other members as well as his desire to be in the band finally landed him a spot.  I've always loved Lane and wished that she played a more central role in the show.  I felt that in the first three seasons she was a more two-dimensional character.  Here she finally starts to develop into a more realistic and nuanced character.It is rather odd how slowly the DVDs for the show are coming out.  The standard practice for most shows has become to get the previous year's season out on DVD before the new one begins, but anyone wanting to start anew on the show will not be able to catch up by watching all five previous seasons on DVD.  But the great news is that while it has been slow to come out on DVD, on TV it has remained consistently excellent.  Will the show last past Season Six?  A good friend of mine pointed out that the principles were signed to a six-year contract, so it could very well be that if the show lasts beyond the next season, some major changes could be in store.  If Lauren Graham fails to sign a new contract, it would pretty much signal the end of the show, which would in turn create a crisis for the WB.  With their cancellation of ANGEL last year and with SMALLVILLE having matured as a series, without the GILMORE GIRLS there are amazingly few frontline series left on the network.  Stay tuned for further developments.",5,Big Changes for the Girls and Their Friends,1123804800,"08 12, 2005",2005,5021,"['are', 'widely', 'diverging', 'opinions', 'Season', 'Four', 'THE', 'GILMORE',

914574,AGSWTH7SP2256,B0009WFF6S,R. W. Rasband,"[11, 12]","The conventional wisdom about season 4 of ""Gilmore Girls"" is that it wasn't as good as the show had previously been.  Supposedly Rory's move away from her mother to Yale removed much of the show's fizz.  I simply have to disagree with this.  With a show as intelligent and well-written as this one the characters are going to grow and evolve almost like people do in real life (especially young people like Rory.)  This can dramatically be seen at the end of season 4 as Rory embarks on the first of several badly thought-out decisions that continue into the current year.  It's rare on TV that a sympathetic character is allowed to mess up her life, complete with consequences.  (Like Willow, on ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"", for example.)  It seems that some fans don't have the patience to allow a character to grow, or just don't like the new and unfamiliar.  If you see ""Gilmore Girls"" as one long story and season 4 as just one chapter in a continuing drama it will make more sense to you.  Look at it this way: Rory could totally change her life in a new direction tomorrow, while still remaining the same quirky girl we all like.  Wouldn't that be interesting?It's not like there wasn't other cool stuff going on in Stars Hollow.  We can see Luke and Lorelai inch ever closer, almost unwillingly it seems at times (I especially like ""In the Clamor and the Clangor."")  The wonderful Liza Weil, hilarious as the abrasive but vulnerable Paris, stumbles into unlikely romance.  Lorelai and Sookie's frustrations in opening their inn seem very true-to-life to me, culminating with Lorelai's near-nervous breakdown in ""The Incredible Shrinking Lorelais.""  As always, Lauren Graham is ""a geyser of charisma"", as Fametracker puts it.  I don't think there is a more compelling or watchable (or funnier) actress around today.  Why she isn't a great big movie star is a complete mystery, but we should enjoy her on ""Gilmore Girls"" while we can.  Alexis Bledel has been criticized for her ""mumbly"" line readings and waifish countenance, but she strikes me as a more convincing kid than the more phony self-assured young adults we see on other shows.  That she has inherited her mother's bad dealings with men (except for Luke) is a nice touch of psychological realism.  Season 4 ends of course with Lorelai finally falling into Luke's arms at long last, a most satisfying event for most fans, and reason enough to own this DVD set.(Included in the DVD set is an astounding deleted scene where Lane and Rory totally dis Liz Phair's most recent album, thus once again proving what hilariously pretentious little rock snobs they are.)",5,Not Worse; Just Different (and Better Than They Say),1127692800,"09 26, 2005",2005,2625,"['conventional', 'wisdom', 'season', '4', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'show', 'had', 'previously', 'been', 'Supposedly', 'Rory', 'move', 'away', 'mother', 'Yale', 'removed', 'much', 'show', 'fizz', 'simply', 'have', 'disagree', 'show', 'intelligent', 'well-written', 'one', 'characters', 'are', 'going', 'grow', 'evolve', 'almost', 'people', 'do', 'real', 'life', 'especially', 'young', 'people', 'Rory', 'can', 'dramatically', 'be', 'seen', 'end', 'season', '4', 'Rory', 'first', 'several', 'badly', 'thought-out', 'decisions', 'continue', 'current', 'year', 'rare', 'TV', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'allowed', 'mess', 'up', 'life', 'complete', 'consequences', 'Willow', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'example', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'patience', 'allow', 'character', 'grow', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'new', 'unfamiliar', 'see', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'one', 'long', 'story', 'season', '4', 'just', 'one', 'chapter', 'continuing', 'drama', 'will', 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'Look', 'way', 'Rory', 'could', 'totally', 'change', 'life', 'new', 'direction', 'tomorrow', 'still', 'remaining', 'same', 'quirky', 'girl', 'Would', ""n't"", 'be', 'interesting', 'not', 'was', ""n't"", 'other', 'cool', 'stuff', 'going', 'Stars', 'Hollow', 'can', 'see', 'Luke', 'Lorelai', 'inch', 'ever', 'closer', 'almost', 'times', 'especially', 'Clamor', 'Clangor', 'wonderful', 'Liza', 'Weil', 'hilarious', 'abrasive', 'vulnerable', 'Paris', 'unlikely', 'romance', 'Lorelai', 'Sookie', 'frustrations', 'opening', 'inn', 'seem', 'very', 'true-to-life', 'culminating', 'Lorelai', 'near-nervous', 'breakdown', 'Incredible', 'Shrinking', 'Lorelais', 'always', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'geyser', 'charisma', 'Fametracker', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'more', 'compelling', 'watchable', 'funnier', 'actress', 'today', 'Why', ""n't"", 'great', 'big', 'movie', 'star', 'complete', 'mystery', 'should', 'enjoy', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'can', 'Alexis', 'Bledel', 'been', 'criticized', 'mumbly', 'line', 'readings', 'waifish', 'countenance', 'more', 'convincing', 'kid', 'more', 'phony', 'self-assured', 'young', 'adults', 'see', 'other', 'shows', 'inherited', 'mother', 'bad', 'dealings', 'men', 'Luke', 'nice', 'touch', 'psychological', 'realism', 'Season', '4', 'ends', 'course', 'Lorelai', 'finally', 'falling', 'Luke', 'arms', 'long', 'last', 'most', 'satisfying', 'event', 'most', 'fans', 'reason', 'enough', 'own', 'DVD', 'set', 'Included', 'DVD', 'set', 'astounding', 'deleted', 'scene', 'where', 'Lane', 'Rory', 'totally', 'Liz', 'Phair', 'most', 'recent', 'album', 'thus', 'once', 'again', 'proving', 'what', 'hilariously', 'pretentious', 'little', 'rock', 'snobs', 'are']",N/A

We buy snacks, watch most of a season in a day, and talk about the show all the way through. We relate to the characters on a personal level, yet without the charm of Stars Hollow to nestle into at the end of the day unfortunately.The thing is, Gilmore Girls is a smart show. It throws out references so fast that watching it feels energizing rather than draining. The fashion is about a year or two ahead usually, which is fun. Plus,. in this age of ClearChannel radio, it is great to hear lesser-known bands featured on a regular basis.We are definitely huge fans of Gilmore Girls, but would I enjoy it as much if I did not have daughters? I'm not sure.I enjoy having a show that doesn't wrap things up neatly most of the time, and a show that doesn't develop around characters who fit into the ""acceptable role model"" slot. These characters are good people who screw up as they are living their daily lives. And they keep going, keep connecting with the world around them, and keep loving each other.It is another one of those shows that certain parents wouldn't trust their kids to be able to interpret. Watching a show about a single mother who makes something of herself in spite of a teenage pregnancy isn't going to say ""This is a good idea.""What it says is that life is messy, and the thing is to keep moving ahead with as much grace and vision as possible.",5,LOVE this series,1149552000,"06 6, 2006",2006,1478,"['daughters', '14', '10', 'time', 'review', 'make', 'habit', 'gilmore-ing', 'v', 'regular', 'basis', 'buy', 'snacks', 'watch', 'most', 'season', 'day', 'talk', 'show', 'way', 'relate', 'characters', 'personal', 'level', 'yet', 'charm', 'Stars', 'Hollow', 'nestle', 'end', 'day', 'unfortunately.The', 'thing', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'smart', 'show', 'out', 'references', 'so', 'fast', 'watching', 'energizing', 'rather', 'draining', 'fashion', 'year', 'two', 'ahead', 'usually', 'fun', 'age', 'ClearChannel', 'radio', 'great', 'hear', 'lesser-known', 'bands', 'featured', 'regular', 'basis.We', 'are', 'definitely', 'huge', 'fans', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'would', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'daughters', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure.I', 'enjoy', 'having', 'show', ""n't"", 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'neatly', 'most', 'time', 'show', ""n't"", 'develop', 'characters', 'who', 'fit', 'acceptable', 'role', 'model', 'slot', 'characters', 'are', 'good', 'people', 'who', 'screw', 'up', 'are', 'living', 'daily', 'lives', 'keep', 'going', 'keep', 'connecting', 'world', 'keep', 'loving', 'other.It', 'one', 'shows', 'certain', 'parents', 'would', ""n't"", 'trust', 'kids', 'be', 'able', 'interpret', 'Watching', 'show', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'something', 'herself', 'spite', 'teenage', 'pregnancy', ""n't"", 'going', 'say', 'good', 'idea', 'What', 'life', 'messy', 'thing', 'keep', 'moving', 'ahead', 'as', 'much', 'grace', 'vision', 'possible']",N/A

And I have to say I have never laughed so hard in any of the previous Gilmore Girls seasons like I have laughed in the 4th. In some instances I had to just rewind some scenes to re-watch the joke and laugh even harder-especially when the scene had Kirk in it.In my opinion it was the 3rd season that was not up-to-par and if it was not for Rory and Jess, I would not even have bothered to take the time to watch it.And why is everyone complaining about Luke and Lorelai's ""slow"" start??? Honestly, how do you expect a series to last a long time unless the 2 main characters you want so desperately to get together are dragged and dangled in front of the viewer as a romantic teaser so that fans keep watching the show year after year; so the pacing was just fine and not too slow whatsoever-this is not a friggen movie, have patience people!My only complaint was about Rory and Jess....and Dean. Even though Jess is slowly being written off the show, Rory and Jess should have had a painful but physically intimate closure. However, Dean stole it instead and that was just plain wrong, not because of Dean being married, but because Rory truly loved Jess in the 3rd Season and the ending between him and Rory-after he confesses his love for her and asking her to move away with him  to New York- just felt cold and unnatural on Rory's part.Other than that colossal mistake, go ahead and enjoy this fantastic season!",5,What in God's name was everyone complaining about??,1128124800,"10 1, 2005",2005,1765,"['was', 'expected', 'be', 'very', 'disappointed', 'when', 'watched', '4th', 'season', 'due', 'so', 'many', 'reviewers', 'comments', 'season', 'lackluster', 'wit', 'painful', 'transitions', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'sheer', 'fun', 'novelty', 'everything', 'happening', 'girls.Everything', 'different', 'fresh-new', 'Inn', 'new', 'school', 'new', 'people', 'new', 'connections', 'have', 'say', 'have', 'never', 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'previous', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'seasons', 'have', 'laughed', '4th', 'instances', 'had', 'just', 'rewind', 'scenes', 're-watch', 'joke', 'laugh', 'even', 'harder-especially', 'when', 'scene', 'had', 'Kirk', 'it.In', 'opinion', 'was', '3rd', 'season', 'was', 'not', 'up-to-par', 'was', 'not', 'Rory', 'Jess', 'would', 'not', 'even', 'have', 'bothered', 'take', 'time', 'watch', 'it.And', 'why', 'everyone', 'complaining', 'Luke', 'Lorelai', 'slow', 'start', 'Honestly', 'how', 'do', 'expect', 'series', 'last', 'long', 'time', '2', 'main', 'characters', 'want', 'so', 'desperately', 'get', 'together', 'are', 'dragged', 'dangled', 'front', 'viewer', 'romantic', 'teaser', 'fans', 'keep', 'watching', 'show', 'year', 'year', 'pacing', 'was', 'just', 'fine', 'not', 'too', 'slow', 'whatsoever-this', 'not', 'friggen', 'movie', 'have', 'patience', 'people', 'only', 'complaint', 'was', 'Rory', 'Jess', '.and', 'Dean', 'Even', 'Jess', 'slowly', 'being', 'written', 'off', 'show', 'Rory', 'Jess', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'painful', 'physically', 'intimate', 'closure', 'However', 'Dean', 'stole', 'instead', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'wrong', 'not', 'Dean', 'being', 'married', 'Rory', 'truly', 'loved', 'Jess', '3rd', 'Season', 'ending', 'Rory-after', 'love', 'asking', 'move', 'away', 'New', 'York-', 'just', 'felt', 'cold', 'unnatural', 'Rory', 'part.Other', 'colossal', 'mistake', 'go', 'ahead', 'enjoy', 'fantastic', 'season']",N/A

This changed the dynamics of Lorelai [Lauren Graham's] and Rory's interaction, being reduced to mainly trying to get each other on the cellphone. There was an element of being lost here for both characters, but especially so with Rory, who after breaking up with Jess in Season three [well, technically it was Jess just walking out on Rory] finds herself trying to adapt to a whole new environment [the only constant being Paris, who is her roomie at Yale] and with no real romantic suitors around.Lorelai finds herself and Sookie seeing their dreams of an inn becoming a reality, though with many problems in between. Lorelai gets romantically entangled with her father's business partner, Jason aka Digger Stiles [Chris Eigeman] and the problems the relationship poses.However, Jason is not really a character that appeals to viewers, coming across as stuffy and unsuitable for Lorelai.Despite these hiccups, there are some truly great episodes which keep viewers entertained [The Festival of Living Art for example, and the episode where Luke realises a certain winsome coffee addict is his true soulmate].All these and more will keep fans happy and new viewers entertained.",4,"Not the best of the GG seasons, but has its high points",1327536000,"01 26, 2012",2012,1306,"['Season', 'Four', 'was', 'hard', 'season', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'was', 'primarily', 'Rory', '[', 'Alexis', 'Bledel', ']', 'going', 'off', 'Yale', 'changed', 'dynamics', 'Lorelai', '[', 'Lauren', 'Graham', ']', 'Rory', 'interaction', 'being', 'reduced', 'mainly', 'trying', 'get', 'other', 'cellphone', 'was', 'element', 'being', 'lost', 'here', 'characters', 'especially', 'so', 'Rory', 'who', 'breaking', 'up', 'Jess', 'Season', 'three', '[', 'well', 'technically', 'was', 'Jess', 'just', 'walking', 'out', 'Rory', ']', 'trying', 'adapt', 'whole', 'new', 'environment', 'only', 'constant', 'being', 'Paris', 'who', 'roomie', 'Yale', ']', 'real', 'romantic', 'suitors', 'around.Lorelai', 'Sookie', 'seeing', 'dreams', 'inn', 'becoming', 'reality', 'many', 'problems', 'Lorelai', 'romantically', 'entangled', 'father', 'business', 'partner', 'Jason', 'aka', 'Digger', 'Stiles', '[', 'Chris', 'Eigeman', ']', 'problems', 'relationship', 'poses.However', 'Jason', 'not', 'really', 'character', 'appeals', 'viewers', 'coming', 'stuffy', 'unsuitable', 'Lorelai.Despite', 'hiccups', 'are', 'truly', 'great', 'episodes', 'keep', 'viewers', 'entertained', 'Festival', 'Living', 'Art', 'example', 'episode', 'where', 'Luke', 'certain', 'winsome', 'coffee', 'addict', 'true', 'soulmate', ']', '.All', 'more', 'will', 'keep', 'fans', 'happy', 'new', 'viewers', 'entertained']",N/A
