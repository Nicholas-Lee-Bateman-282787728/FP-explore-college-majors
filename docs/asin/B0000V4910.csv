784638,A47OISX4AV8I,B0000V4910,AngelosOne,"[49, 56]","Call me weird, but this show is almost a study of human nature.  It vividly portrays the many possible ways humans will react when they have lost everything.  Some will turn to crime, victimizing everyone so as to better their own condition.  Others will turn to despair, and simply lead lives that ultimately amount to nothing.  And sadly, very few will try to help their fellow human beings, at a cost to them.It is sad to think that if the show's premise really did happen, we would have more ""raiders,"" ""psychos,"" and ""animals"" than we would have people like Jeremiah.Anyway, I came upon this show on a Sam Goody store.  I was browsing their dvd tv section, when I saw this boxset.  I had never even heard of this show before, but I took a chance and bought it on an impulse buy.  Let me tell you, it was the best 70 something dollars I've spent.One of the best sci-fi series in a while, it is smart and well written.  All the episodes, while seemingly loosely connected, actually weave a deep story arc about the rebuilding of a civilization gone wrong.I'm wondering if the ""reviewer"" Upright Ape has even seen this series.  What makes me wonder is when he refers to this series as having pretty FX.  I mean, this series is probably the only sci-fi series that doesn't really have much in the way of special FXs.  I mean, unless he's calling the big explosion in episode 3 a major FX?  As for sayng this series is a knock off of a knock off, is like calling Star Trek a knock off of any other space fairing piece of sci-fi that came before it.  If that's the case, I can say that Star Trek is a knock off of the old Lensman series, which most modern sci-fi is derived from.He then goes on to mention some rather obscure (at least to me) series and book, and then says this is the most overused theme in sci-fi?  I'm sorry, but while I do agree that the basic premise of Jeremiah has been used before (what in sci-fi has never been done before?) the series, as a whole has a very unique way of portraying the after effects and the goals of the people living in this world.  The fact that the eldest were killed by a virus is only the setting of the story.  It's like saying that any space show is merely a knock off of another, which we all know is quite fallacious, since while the setting might be space, each show creates their own universe that is radically different from any other.",5,A study of the human condition....,1106870400,"01 28, 2005",2005,2391,"['Call', 'weird', 'show', 'almost', 'study', 'human', 'nature', 'vividly', 'many', 'possible', 'ways', 'humans', 'will', 'react', 'when', 'have', 'lost', 'everything', 'will', 'turn', 'crime', 'victimizing', 'everyone', 'so', 'better', 'own', 'condition', 'Others', 'will', 'turn', 'despair', 'simply', 'lead', 'lives', 'ultimately', 'amount', 'nothing', 'sadly', 'very', 'few', 'will', 'try', 'help', 'fellow', 'human', 'beings', 'cost', 'them.It', 'sad', 'think', 'show', 'premise', 'really', 'did', 'happen', 'would', 'have', 'more', 'raiders', 'psychos', 'animals', 'would', 'have', 'people', 'Jeremiah.Anyway', 'came', 'show', 'Sam', 'Goody', 'store', 'was', 'browsing', 'dvd', 'tv', 'section', 'when', 'saw', 'boxset', 'had', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'show', 'took', 'chance', 'bought', 'impulse', 'buy', 'Let', 'tell', 'was', 'best', '70', 'something', 'dollars', ""'ve"", 'spent.One', 'best', 'sci-fi', 'series', 'while', 'smart', 'well', 'written', 'episodes', 'seemingly', 'loosely', 'connected', 'actually', 'weave', 'deep', 'story', 'arc', 'rebuilding', 'civilization', 'gone', 'wrong.I', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'reviewer', 'Upright', 'Ape', 'even', 'seen', 'series', 'What', 'wonder', 'when', 'series', 'having', 'pretty', 'FX', 'mean', 'series', 'probably', 'only', 'sci-fi', 'series', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'much', 'way', 'special', 'FXs', 'mean', 'calling', 'big', 'explosion', 'episode', '3', 'major', 'FX', 'sayng', 'series', 'knock', 'knock', 'off', 'calling', 'Star', 'Trek', 'knock', 'other', 'space', 'fairing', 'piece', 'sci-fi', 'came', 'case', 'can', 'say', 'Star', 'Trek', 'knock', 'old', 'Lensman', 'series', 'most', 'modern', 'sci-fi', 'derived', 'from.He', 'then', 'mention', 'rather', 'obscure', 'least', 'series', 'book', 'then', 'most', 'overused', 'theme', 'sci-fi', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'do', 'agree', 'basic', 'premise', 'Jeremiah', 'been', 'used', 'what', 'sci-fi', 'never', 'been', 'done', 'series', 'whole', 'very', 'unique', 'way', 'portraying', 'effects', 'goals', 'people', 'living', 'world', 'fact', 'eldest', 'were', 'killed', 'virus', 'only', 'setting', 'story', 'saying', 'space', 'show', 'merely', 'knock', 'know', 'quite', 'fallacious', 'setting', 'might', 'be', 'space', 'show', 'own', 'universe', 'radically', 'different', 'other']",N/A

784640,AHF361GC0S8HR,B0000V4910,B. Elmore,"[1, 1]","I am not a walking encyclopedia of all things sci-fi.  I enjoy it and I watch it regularly, but some things haven't caught my interest and this show is one.It isn't particularly believable.  I actually enjoy suspending reality for fiction, so when I say that, just know that I can &#34;believe&#34; a lot of things for a story's sake.  But not this one.  Children 13 and younger were left alive, right? Who buried all those adult bodies?  If they aren't buried, then what happened to the inevitable disease?  Who took care of all of those babies?  There should be a distinct age line because the babies (toddlers and infants) would not have survived with just 13 year old &#34;parents&#34;.  And how have they figured out their technology? Who taught them to read? They had trade going on; they had travel going on; they had gangs; they had scientific experiments going on.  I just didn't buy it, not that level of civilization.The language.  Here are two things that I know. First, cable tv is absolutely gleeful about using formerly prohibited language. It is as if they stick their collective tongues out at network tv and say, &#34;We get to curse, and you don't&#34;.  Second, excessive cursing is proof that one does not have the ability to communicate in any other way.  Therefore, in my opinion, the writers of this show were lacking in simple writing ability. Not only can they not communicate without excessive cursing, but they couldn't come up with even remotely plausible story lines.Often the beauty of sci-fi is cliche.  Seriously, we know the plots and we know the characters.  Sometimes, someone comes up with a character who is different.  Mal Reynolds on &#34;Firefly&#34; comes to mind.  In that show Joss Whedon created amalgamated characters.  Reynolds was a cross between Han Solo and John Wayne.  The characters in &#34;Jeremiah&#34; are straight out of the &#34;How to write a sci-fi&#34; handbook. The broody, handsome loner who has a terrible secret/burden to bear, but has a armor coated code of ethics that make him &#34;gooder&#34; than good.  The wanna be bad guy who has a heart of gold and falls in love at first sight.  The beautiful bad girl who uses sex and smarts to build an army so she can own. it. all.  Puleezzz!  Done, done, and done.I had hopes for the &#34;children&#34; of Thunder mountain. Personally, I was hoping that they'd pull out the trusty Stargate or maybe we'd see the children of Jack and Sam (Stargate SG-1, if you didn't follow that), but, alas, just boring characters.  So, I skipped to the last couple of episodes to see if the writing got any better.  Well, no luck there.  A wonderful, thought-provoking episode on...wait for it...racism!!  Really? What's the point?  Instead of intimating that all white people are racist and bad and thugs, why can't we find a less abrasive way to approach the subject.  Gene Roddenberry dealt a swift blow to racists in the 60's with an easy little nudge.  What nudge, you ask?  A white captain (I know, I know, but it was the 60's), a vulcan first officer, a Japanese (tough on the WWII vets) helmsman, a Russian (tough on the then current cold war fanatics) navigator and, oh yeah, a black (tough on the still active KKK crowd) communications officer.  He didn't have to say a word.  We saw racial harmony in action.  And it was good. That vision, Gene Roddenberry's view of our world in a couple of centuries, has stayed with me all of my grown up life.So, writing...not good, lacking imagination and tried too hard to be shocking and edgy with vulgar language ; individual show themes...weak and tired; overall theme and story line...too cliche and tired; character development...weak and clicheI wanted &#34;Jeremiah&#34; to be a good show.  I live out in the boonies and I don't have cable, so I have to find shows to stream and watch.  Well, I don't HAVE to, but if I want to watch or try something new, streaming is how its done out here. While one would think that those circumstances alone would make me less picky, it appears that I still have standards.  The biggest death blow, for me personally, was the language.  I don't speak that way; I can filter some if the show is worth it, but often I simply lose interest.  Often, the writing/story lines aren't good enough to make it worth an effort to filter. So I don't.So, a not so good opinion in the sea of good opinions.

Browne ""cbbrowne""","[4, 4]","One of the other reviewers pointed out that the underlying concept is repetitively derivative, that other works have covered the underlying idea.Well, it may be that there was a Star Trek episode with a similar technical premise; the overall execution of the series is really the grander question.  The ""McGuffin"" is merely the excuse to start the story; the reason to tell the story is that there's a good story to be told.  JMS's name on it is a reasonable ""mark of probable competence.""  One of the neatest ideas I heard was the suggestion of JMS writing a Star Trek series; his involvement with Spiderman clearly indicates he can treat an existing ""world"" with respect, and I think it would be a fascinating take on the Federation.  But I digress...I saw Jeremiah in a video store, and as soon as I saw JMS's name on it, knew I had to buy it, immediately.  The weakest of his work is so much better than most of what's on TV these days that it felt like a ""must have,"" and I wasn't wrong.It's interesting to see Perry and Jamal-Warner both growing from 'youth actors' into actors with real adult presence.  Throw in JMS writing, and it's guaranteed to be interesting; he has a powerful way of getting people to say things you *didn't* expect.The one moment I think I most liked was when Kurdy examined a sniper's body, and started drawing grand conclusions based on the simple fact that he was wearing new, clean underwear.  What scared him the most about whomever dunnit was the fact that they had *SUCH* resources that they could afford to make sure guys like this sniper could have clean underwear after the economy has collapsed.

In 2006, a virus spread around the world killing virtually ever post-puberty person everywhere. 15 years later, the young survivors have now become adults themselves in a world where society as it was no longer exists. Instead, people have formed small communities where trading and bartering have become the de facto method of currency as people try surviving the best way possible.As for Jeremiah and Kurdy, they find themselves ultimately becoming part of a group at NORAD, run by Marcus Alexander, a man with large dreams of bringing people out of the rathole situation the virus left them in and bringing a better world for everyone.I had seen a little of show once on the ScyFy Channel a year or two ago and enjoyed what I saw a lot. Finally buying it, I was not disappointed by season one at all or felt like the $12.31 I spent (counting shipping) was wasted.The acting in the show, from all the main and non-regular actors, was pretty good. As far as non-regular cast members go, I thought Jason Priestly, who starred with Luke Perry on a certain popular 90s show, was great as the demented psychopath whose group happened to have set up home in a former military base.The show was a little slow in the beginning but I thought it picks up nicely as it goes along though.

I have continued to look at, read when translated into English, and enjoy Hermann's work ever since.  He's such a great storyteller, I can usually figure out the plot by looking at his drawings even when I can't read the French text.  And the Jeremiah series is one of Hermann's best.Three different publishers took a stab at putting out Jeremiah in English, and while I really liked those books, they must not have sold very well.  But with 28 volumes to date, somebody out there is buying a lot of them. (You'll find a short list of Hermann's work if you do a search on ""Hermann Huppen"" and check Wikipedia.)I bought the DVD set of Jeremiah, the complete first season, when it was released in 2004, and I looked forward to watching the whole series.  Since viewing the first episode, I have TRIED to go back to it every few years ever since, but I'm only on episode 3.  I keep thinking I have seen more than I have, because I remember it as being a painful experience.  Tonight I lasted about 2 minutes and had to give up again.  Something about a sad girl dishing up slops with a fake tear stuck on her cheek confiding in soft spoken sympathetic poofter Perry is all just too EMO for me.  I can't overlook the poor acting, which is soooo stilted it becomes quickly ridiculous.  Try as I might to get into the story and overlook the cheap and phony sets, costumes and production values, I am constantly reminded that the stars are poseurs, trying to act cool and tough, and it all just feels fake.  Were those people having trouble reading their lines off of cue cards?  If fans of Luke Perry and Malcolm-Jamal Warner are as impressed with those actors half as much as they appear to be with themselves, that might explain the positive reviews, but their efforts at playing John Wayne, Don Johnson or James Dean in a post plague world are so lame as to make it extremely difficult to sit through.  And the rest of the cast isn't any better.Maybe if I was weaned on The Cosby Show or Beverly Hills 90210, I could dig it.  I like seeing Johnny Depp work, though one pirate movie was enough.  Somehow giving Jeremiah a bad review feels like kicking a run over dog.  If this show was a little worse, if that's even possible, Jeremiah might be considered camp, kitsch or even funny.

784665,AW6KMT2FPLLXH,B0000V4910,Homeschooling Single Mom,"[32, 34]","In this series by the creators of Babylon 5 (which I liked much less than Jeremiah), Luke Perry plays Jeremiah, a kind of lost, disaffected mid-20s guy who 15 years earlier lived through what's come to be known as the Big Death - a bioweapon hormone-based virus that 15 years earlier wiped out everyone who was past puberty. So it was that civilization was totally engulfed in post-apocalyptic chaos, since the only people who were left living were the children.Things haven't changed much in 15 years. In fact, with supplies from ""Before"" rapidly waning, things may actually be getting worse. There's no electricity or running water or long-distance communication any more, batteries and gasoline are worth their weight in gold, food is hard to come by, and society is basically total anarchy. They're living off the scraps of the world ""before.""In the midst of all of this, Jeremiah's on a quest to find the place that his parents told him they were heading to for safety before they disappeared 15 years earlier. He assumes they're dead like all the other adults, but still wants to know ""how their story ends.""In the pilot he meets Kurdy, who is played to pitch perfection by Malcolm Jamal Warner as this slightly younger, very lonely guy and they sort of form a team, realizing there's strength in numbers. He's looking for something too - he just isn't sure what that might be yet.The series is about the really gritty, harsh world they live in, the political battles between the various factions that want to take over, and the hope of a better tomorrow. The story telling is very intimate.  The scripts are often punctuated by quiet, revealing moments for the characters, and the show makes no bones about how much the inhabitants of this world constantly suffer, so it's really harrowing at times, but the characterization and acting and plot are extremely gripping.I originally caught this when it aired on Showtime and bought the season on DVD, and I wasn't sorry.  The world of the show is very realistic, and the dialogue is fascinating, because none of these characters went to school much, and they all talk and act like you'd expect people whose world ground to a traumatic halt as children to act. They're bratty, selfish, manipulative, never stupid (survival skills born of necessity and all that) sometimes painfully naive, and always hopeful that things will return to the way they were ""before.""The DVD has hours of extras that show exactly how much thought has gone into building the mythos of this show.  Showtime is just now going to start airing the second half of S2 in September 2004 (the last new episode aired November 2003) and no one is sure about a third season. But this is modern sci fi at its best and most gripping, and while the price is a bit steep at nearly $80, it's well worth it for the quality.  Who would have thought that a show starring Dylan from ""90210"" and Cliff Huxtable's only son could be this good? =)",5,A tragically underrated sci-fi classic,1093392000,"08 25, 2004",2004,2954,"['series', 'creators', 'Babylon', '5', 'liked', 'much', 'less', 'Jeremiah', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'Jeremiah', 'kind', 'lost', 'disaffected', 'mid-20s', 'guy', 'who', '15', 'years', 'earlier', 'lived', 'what', 'come', 'be', 'known', 'Big', 'Death', 'bioweapon', 'hormone-based', 'virus', '15', 'years', 'earlier', 'wiped', 'out', 'everyone', 'who', 'was', 'past', 'puberty', 'was', 'civilization', 'was', 'totally', 'engulfed', 'post-apocalyptic', 'chaos', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'left', 'living', 'were', 'children.Things', 'have', ""n't"", 'changed', 'much', '15', 'years', 'fact', 'supplies', 'rapidly', 'waning', 'things', 'may', 'actually', 'be', 'getting', 'worse', 'electricity', 'running', 'water', 'long-distance', 'communication', 'more', 'batteries', 'gasoline', 'are', 'worth', 'weight', 'gold', 'food', 'hard', 'come', 'society', 'basically', 'total', 'anarchy', ""'re"", 'living', 'off', 'scraps', 'world', 'midst', 'Jeremiah', 'quest', 'find', 'place', 'parents', 'told', 'were', 'heading', 'safety', 'disappeared', '15', 'years', 'earlier', ""'re"", 'dead', 'other', 'adults', 'still', 'know', 'how', 'story', 'pilot', 'Kurdy', 'who', 'played', 'pitch', 'perfection', 'Malcolm', 'Jamal', 'Warner', 'slightly', 'younger', 'very', 'lonely', 'guy', 'sort', 'form', 'team', 'realizing', 'strength', 'numbers', 'looking', 'something', 'too', 'just', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'yet.The', 'series', 'really', 'gritty', 'harsh', 'world', 'live', 'political', 'battles', 'various', 'factions', 'want', 'take', 'over', 'hope', 'better', 'tomorrow', 'story', 'telling', 'very', 'intimate', 'scripts', 'are', 'often', 'punctuated', 'quiet', 'revealing', 'moments', 'characters', 'show', 'bones', 'how', 'much', 'inhabitants', 'world', 'constantly', 'suffer', 'really', 'harrowing', 'times', 'characterization', 'acting', 'plot', 'are', 'extremely', 'gripping.I', 'originally', 'caught', 'when', 'aired', 'Showtime', 'bought', 'season', 'DVD', 'was', ""n't"", 'sorry', 'world', 'show', 'very', 'realistic', 'dialogue', 'fascinating', 'none', 'characters', 'went', 'school', 'much', 'talk', 'act', ""'d"", 'expect', 'people', 'world', 'ground', 'traumatic', 'halt', 'children', 'act', ""'re"", 'bratty', 'selfish', 'manipulative', 'never', 'stupid', 'survival', 'skills', 'born', 'necessity', 'sometimes', 'painfully', 'naive', 'always', 'hopeful', 'things', 'will', 'return', 'way', 'were', 'before', 'DVD', 'hours', 'extras', 'show', 'exactly', 'how', 'much', 'thought', 'gone', 'building', 'mythos', 'show', 'Showtime', 'just', 'now', 'going', 'start', 'airing', 'second', 'half', 'S2', 'September', '2004', 'last', 'new', 'episode', 'aired', 'November', '2003', 'one', 'sure', 'third', 'season', 'modern', 'sci', 'fi', 'best', 'most', 'gripping', 'price', 'bit', 'steep', 'nearly', '80', 'well', 'worth', 'quality', 'Who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'show', 'starring', 'Dylan', '90210', 'Cliff', 'Huxtable', 'only', 'son', 'could', 'be', 'good', '=']",N/A

So 5 years after the show was cancelled I'm discovering Jeremiah and Kurdy's world for the first time. Yes, the first season is a little slow. But I've decided it's supposed to be slow. No lights, no electricity, no running water and no television. The viewer travels with Jeremiah and Kurdy at their pace (where DO they get the gas for that truck, anyway? I guess we're not supposed to ask.) Follow along with them and learn about life and human nature. Rent or buy it, but enjoy it. If I have one complaint it would be that the characters often use slang or expressions they probably wouldn't have had time to learn before thier parents died. Might they not even have their own popular culture jargon by now? Just wondering.Not being the right age to enjoy his earlier work, I had no idea Luke Perry was such a good actor. Through season one and two he grows his Jeremiah character--often with a great deal of protest--into a leader. Jamal is also great. He's perfect in this role. Just perfect. His character also grows and matures and it's plain entertaining to watch. I have just four episodes left to watch of season two. I don't want it to be over! The addition of the new characters in season two was also an excellent decision.The clean underpants scene had me laughing so hard I almost rolled off the couch. What an imagination.

784681,A1DT955GCOQ8C0,B0000V4910,Label,"[1, 1]","Let me begin by stating that I'm a huge JMS fan. Babylon 5 is probably my favorite series of all and I can't say enough good things about what he did with that show and even Crusade, afterwards. It was his involvement that got me into this show and at first, I thought I had really found a gem. The first couple episodes were strong, well written and acted and the show seemed like it had real potential to go places. However, after about the 3rd or 4th episode, the show started settling into that comfortable ""TV show"" of the week feel and really didn't do too much for me, either negatively or positively. There were some nice guest stars and episodes here and there after the first few that kept my interest up, but overall the quality of the episodes weren't strong enough from week to week to garner more than 3 stars overall.I grew up in the 80-90's so Luke Perry was always the cool guy from Beverly Hill 90120 for me and I wasn't sure how I'd accept him in a lead role in a series like this. Honestly, I thought he was reasonably good in the role and was a consistent bright spot throughout the first season. Malcolm does a nice job in the series as well but that's about where the quality ends and you end up with 2nd rate actors to fill in the gaps.

After sampling the first couple of episodes, I was hooked and went through two full seasons.  I guess I shouldn't have been surprised because the creator was J. Michael Straczynski the same creator of the 'Babylon 5' series.This life after a catastrophic event story had some interesting episodes. If you're a fan of these types of stories you pretty much know what to expect.  So when I continued to stay engaged, I was somewhat surprised. For example, if you compare this series to today's popular &#34;Walking Dead&#34; you will realize that contemporary entertainment has far less originality in the story but a lot more shock and gore. It was nice not to constantly see blood and tortured bodies.  They got the message across without having to be so graphic. I realize that this isn't exactly an 'apples to apples' comparison but I think you know what I mean.Some of the &#34;Jeremiah' characters were 'over the top' but they provided relief from a sometimes too somber atmosphere.  I'm not a fan of Luke Perry, the main character, but he did a good job in this role. Since he's in a lot of fights, I had to overcome his physical stature.

I don't have Showtime, so I didn't see it as it aired.The premise is good, and designed to appeal to network executives: 15 years ago, everyone past puberty died in a plague.  Therefore, everyone left alive today is under 30... and has few social inhibitions against nudity or casual sex.  (Hooray for cable!)  People are starting to believe that they're not going to die the Big Death themselves, and are creating families and communities.  The big raiding gangs are running out of places to raid, and people are banding together to kill them off.And now people in the hidden shelters, laden with the old technology, are starting to come out and shape the world... Will we make a new world that's better than the old?  Or will the remains of the old shape the new?The show is very powerful.  Right and wrong are frequently blurry.  Real things happen; our heroes sometimes make a difference and sometimes fail.  And it's got a socko ending!I gave this 4 stars because sometimes it seemed to lose focus.  There are some practical issues; I think there's entirely too much clothing in good repair all over the place, and canned tuna doesn't last 15 years.  I think.  Though our characters do make it up from time to time.  At one point, they identified someone from an enclave by his underwear: ""Hey, Jeremiah, when's the last time you saw someone wearing undamaged underpants?""I also wanted to see more DVD extras.  There were some features on the first disc, but all the others didn't even have a commentary track.

784688,A1JXMT9VDF1AX0,B0000V4910,M. Homan,"[5, 12]","First, a little story background: the start of the series is roughly 15 years after a plague has wiped out all persons who have reached puberty. (I got to this number by guesstimating the age of the lead and subtracting 13 from it, which is roughing the age for entering puberty, plus or minus a little.) I feel the need to add this part because others have indiciated that it is a few years after and that is highly inaccurate.I am trying to get through this, but I really think I am going to end up throwing this out. I loved Babylon 5 and I wanted to like this work, but I don't.One problem is the inconsistencies, which others have pointed out, but to which I will make additions. Early in the series, an automobile shows up and the main characters hop in and drive. If everyone over 13 died and if the gasoline supplies ran out quickly (Implied throughout the story), then how did they know how to drive? You can't learn it from a book and you need enough gas to practice. You also have to be physically big enough to fit in the seat and reach the gas pedals, so driving early, when gas supplies were still plentiful is unlikely.The bigger issue, to me, is food. If the system for moving thing around has completely broken down (again, implied), then you would have a great many more deaths than just the adults. You'd have massive starvation once the canned goods ran out. Few of us know how to farm.Another issue is the wimpiness of some of the women. There's alot of rape or almost rape of secondary characters going on in this series. In all this, not one woman can defend herself by sticking her fingers in the assailant's eyes. Come on, people! We aren't all victims and surviving on our own without our parents would make the survivors strong. (There are two strong women but one is protected in NORAD and the other is crazy.)This is just the beginning, but it is important that science fiction not have too many glaring holes.

I'm also a ""Post-Holocaust"" genre enthusiast, always looking for better examples of this poorly-treated area of Science Fiction.I normally don't bother to write 3-star reviews, but Jeremiah was a mixed bag that demanded comment. While composed of excellent story-telling and a rich background, the series suffers from too many ""Duh, Ralph!"" moments. I've never seen on screen a more realistic and vibrant ""End of the World"" setting, nor such a fine set of lead and character actors for same.Yet the writing quality and direction fails to match. It's never really explained, for example, why Vahalla Sector doesn't shut-down and/or annex Thunder Mountain, which is run with a charming idealistic ineptness. Early on, it's clear that Vahalla Sector is aware of Thunder Mountain's current operations, structure, strategic value, and undisciplined security. They could have seized it in 15 minutes, but don't. Instead, they're checked in a couple of unconvincing Star-Trek-Next-Generation-like moves taken by Thunder Mountain. When they finally take decisive action, you're left wondering why Vahalla Sector didn't act 6 months earlier.Also jarring are the too-often times that Jeremiah & Kurdy -- otherwise written and acted intelligently -- are bushwacked because they won't carry firearms. Yes, yes, I understand the pacifistic motivations (though the two never hesitate to snag weapons from the baddies and plink away). But show me why the pair weren't killed and left in a ditch after their first couple of captures.The action scenes are hit-and-miss, ranging from gripping & visceral down to ""A-Team"" in quality.While the Post-Holocaust world of Jeremiah is displayed with a believable mix of cruelty and kindness, old and new, it's not shown enough. We know from Babylon 5 that JMS can do stunning special effects with a miserly budget; this aspect is on a back burner in Jeremiah. What FX there are, they are at least good... or better. Jeremiah is story-driven, which I applaud, but that's no excuse to ever skimp on the background.I think it boils down to: I found myself sympathetic to Vahalla Sector, and would have ended up rooting for them if they weren't so naughty. I don't like my good guys to be bumbling, cute, and waaayyyy too lucky. ""Jeremiah"" is intriguing and watchable, but flawed.",3,Not quite up to par with J.

784719,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0000V4910,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[9, 10]","The world ends not with a bang but a virus. The &quot;Big Death&quot; has wiped out 6 billion people made up of teenagers and adults and left a world full of orphaned children. Jeremiah is one of these orphaned children trying to find his way in a post-apocalyptic world created from the memory of a dead world. Jeremiah's goal in his new world and new life is to help as many people along the way as he can. His other goal is to find the mysterious &quot;Valhalla Sector&quot; that his father told him about before he died. Somehow it is tied into the tragedy of the past and the fate of the future.J. Michael Strazyncski's latest series written and developed for Showtime is adapted from Herman Huppen's comic book of the same name. While the scope of &quot;Jeremiah&quot; is much smaller than &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, the stories are just as well told and focus more on character than technology. Luke Perry as the title character provides a fresh spin on a character that could easily have fallen into cliche. Malcolm-Jamal Warner provides balance for Perry's altruistic attempt to try and right the wrongs of the world. The two have chemistry on screen and make even the weakest episodes interesting.While &quot;Jeremiah&quot; has a way to go before it can follow in the rather large footsteps of &quot;Babylon 5&quot; and &quot;Crusade&quot;, it's off to a promising start. Stracyznski wrote the pilot as well as roughly half 19 episodes included in this six disc first season boxed set. While the writing does occasionally fail to deliver, the series provides interesting and powerful entertainment as this new venue allows Stracyznski to tackle a number of subjects he wasn't able to with the broad canvas of &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. One of the weaknesses of the first couple of episodes is the villain Theo. While it's interesting to see a woman cast as the &quot;bad guy&quot; in a series like this, the character isn't threatening enough.The picture quality is pretty good overall. The first disc has the 90 minute pilot episode (which, by the way, is available as a free disc with some sets of &quot;Stargate-SG1: Season Five&quot;). I was surprised that the sound is presented only in Stereo Dolby Digital Surround and not in the 5.1 format that's so popular with many new series. The sound quality is fine if a bit less sophisticated and involving than other similar sets.The extras are, curiously, on the first disc and are pretty slim. There's 1 audio commentary from Perry and Warner (nothing from creator/producer/writer JMS)on the pilot. Also included are deleted scenes for the 90 minute pilot, a stills gallery and a short featurette on the series that's pretty standard and was produced as a promo piece for Showtime.The price is certainly right; unlike &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; or &quot;Babylon 5&quot; the 19 episodes (including the 90 minute pilot)and slim extras are priced fairly low for 6 discs. But, then, fans could have recorded it off Showtime and gotten almost everything here with the exception of the extras. Perhaps next time MGM will get it right with &quot;Jeremiah&quot;. As it is, the series is well worth viewing and shows considerable promise. I didn't care for the accordion fold-out packaging (which is similar to that for Fox's &quot;Dark Angel&quot; boxed sets). Let's hope JMS has a chance to complete this interesting series to the planned conclusion.",4,Interesting new science fiction drama from &quot;Babylon 5&quot;writer,1076976000,"02 17, 2004",2004,3413,"['world', 'not', 'bang', 'virus', 'quot', 'Big', 'Death', 'quot', 'wiped', 'out', '6', 'billion', 'people', 'made', 'teenagers', 'adults', 'left', 'world', 'full', 'orphaned', 'children', 'Jeremiah', 'one', 'orphaned', 'children', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'post-apocalyptic', 'world', 'created', 'memory', 'dead', 'world', 'Jeremiah', 'goal', 'new', 'world', 'new', 'life', 'help', 'many', 'people', 'way', 'can', 'other', 'goal', 'find', 'mysterious', 'quot', 'Valhalla', 'Sector', 'quot', 'father', 'told', 'died', 'Somehow', 'tied', 'tragedy', 'past', 'fate', 'future.J', 'Michael', 'Strazyncski', 'latest', 'series', 'written', 'developed', 'Showtime', 'adapted', 'Herman', 'Huppen', 'comic', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'scope', 'quot', 'Jeremiah', 'quot', 'much', 'smaller', 'quot', 'Babylon', '5', 'quot', 'stories', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'told', 'focus', 'more', 'character', 'technology', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'title', 'character', 'fresh', 'spin', 'character', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'fallen', 'cliche', 'Malcolm-Jamal', 'Warner', 'balance', 'Perry', 'altruistic', 'attempt', 'try', 'right', 'wrongs', 'world', 'two', 'have', 'chemistry', 'screen', 'make', 'even', 'weakest', 'episodes', 'interesting.While', 'quot', 'Jeremiah', 'quot', 'way', 'go', 'can', 'follow', 'rather', 'large', 'footsteps', 'quot', 'Babylon', '5', 'quot', 'quot', 'Crusade', 'quot', 'promising', 'start', 'Stracyznski', 'wrote', 'pilot', 'as', 'well', 'roughly', 'half', '19', 'episodes', 'included', 'six', 'disc', 'first', 'season', 'boxed', 'set', 'writing', 'occasionally', 'fail', 'deliver', 'series', 'interesting', 'powerful', 'entertainment', 'new', 'venue', 'Stracyznski', 'tackle', 'number', 'subjects', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'broad', 'canvas', 'quot', 'Babylon', '5', 'quot', 'One', 'weaknesses', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'villain', 'Theo', 'interesting', 'see', 'woman', 'cast', 'quot', 'bad', 'guy', 'quot', 'series', 'character', ""n't"", 'threatening', 'enough.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'pretty', 'good', 'overall', 'first', 'disc', '90', 'minute', 'pilot', 'episode', 'way', 'available', 'free', 'disc', 'sets', 'quot', 'Stargate-SG1', 'Season', 'Five', 'quot', 'was', 'surprised', 'sound', 'presented', 'only', 'Stereo', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'Surround', 'not', '5.1', 'format', 'so', 'popular', 'many', 'new', 'series', 'sound', 'quality', 'fine', 'bit', 'less', 'sophisticated', 'involving', 'other', 'similar', 'sets.The', 'extras', 'are', 'curiously', 'first', 'disc', 'are', 'pretty', 'slim', '1', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Perry', 'Warner', 'nothing', 'creator/producer/writer', 'JMS', 'pilot', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', '90', 'minute', 'pilot', 'stills', 'gallery', 'short', 'featurette', 'series', 'pretty', 'standard', 'was', 'produced', 'promo', 'piece', 'Showtime.The', 'price', 'certainly', 'right', 'quot', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'quot', 'quot', 'Babylon', '5', 'quot', '19', 'episodes', 'including', '90', 'minute', 'pilot', 'slim', 'extras', 'are', 'priced', 'fairly', 'low', '6', 'discs', 'then', 'fans', 'could', 'have', 'recorded', 'off', 'Showtime', 'gotten', 'almost', 'everything', 'here', 'exception', 'extras', 'Perhaps', 'next', 'time', 'MGM', 'will', 'get', 'right', 'quot', 'Jeremiah', 'quot', 'series', 'well', 'worth', 'viewing', 'considerable', 'promise', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'accordion', 'fold-out', 'packaging', 'similar', 'Fox', 'quot', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'quot', 'boxed', 'sets', 'Let', 'hope', 'JMS', 'chance', 'complete', 'interesting', 'series', 'planned', 'conclusion']",N/A
