Prehistoric, with it's focus on the mega fauna that inhabited the regions of the U.S. that are now major cities, could have been great -- but it's not.  The show seems starved for substance.  Constantly, the prehistoric animals featured in these shows are compared to military machinery and weaponry: talons and claws are ""smart missiles,"" tails are ""crushing tank treads,"" predatory jaws are ""weapons of mass destruction.""

I felt a little differently, but I knew what I was getting in advance after seeing the series on the Science Channel.  It has also been repeated quite a bit on the Green Channel.  Basically, each episode takes a modern city and flashes back to what the sites of these cities may have looked like at various points in the prehistoric past.  Occasionally, they use the imagery of prehistoric animals walking around the modern city.  In some cases, they have animals like sea turtles swimming in prehistoric seas which are superimposed over the modern buildings.  I thought this was kind of fun.  I liked the narration, and they did have a number of serious academics as ""talking heads"" including various geology and paleontology professors and scholars.  As in many of these specials, Robert Bakker was there and had some interesting things to say.  Some of the other guests were much less impressive (park rangers, fossil hunters), but they usually did not try to go beyond their limited expartise. I also liked the fact that when referring to the prehistoric life of a city, they often mentioned the museums and fossil sites of that city (as would be expected).
