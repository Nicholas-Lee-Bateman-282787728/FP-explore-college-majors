862442,ABC8FXLD7W528,B00067BBN2,"Penny Zeller, Christian Author and Speaker","[0, 0]","Max Lucado, along with the gifted voices of Tim Conway, Don Knotts, and Melissa Disney join forces to create another great Hermie episode. This time, we learn about a misbehaving bee, who not only gets into trouble himself, but also causes others to detour from making good choices in the process. Many great discussion questions abound with this animated flick, including the harm in causing others to stumble.This movie is appropriate for all ages, and after it was over, I asked my daughters what they had learned. My youngest answered, ""to obey God's rules and keep on the straight path."" She added, ""or else you'll be on a bumpy path."" :) My oldest answered, ""to obey and to honor others.""We all make choices in life and those choices have consequences. Buzby the Misbehaving Bee is another positive reinforcement for teaching our children to make good choices throughout their lives. I have added this movie to my Mom-Approved Movie List on my Wordpress blog.",5,Another great Hermie,1307923200,"06 13, 2011",2011,965,"['Max', 'Lucado', 'gifted', 'voices', 'Tim', 'Conway', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'Melissa', 'Disney', 'join', 'forces', 'create', 'great', 'Hermie', 'episode', 'time', 'learn', 'misbehaving', 'bee', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'trouble', 'also', 'others', 'detour', 'making', 'good', 'choices', 'process', 'Many', 'great', 'discussion', 'questions', 'abound', 'animated', 'flick', 'including', 'harm', 'causing', 'others', 'stumble.This', 'movie', 'appropriate', 'ages', 'was', 'asked', 'daughters', 'what', 'had', 'learned', 'youngest', 'answered', 'obey', 'God', 'rules', 'keep', 'straight', 'path', 'added', 'else', ""'ll"", 'be', 'bumpy', 'path', 'oldest', 'answered', 'obey', 'honor', 'others', 'make', 'choices', 'life', 'choices', 'have', 'consequences', 'Misbehaving', 'Bee', 'positive', 'reinforcement', 'teaching', 'children', 'make', 'good', 'choices', 'lives', 'have', 'added', 'movie', 'Mom-Approved', 'Movie', 'List', 'Wordpress', 'blog']",N/A
