This time however was an experience I do not want to repeat. I like the old Errol Flynn movies;Robin Hood,Captain Blood,Sea Hawk etc.so I ordered this set expecting everything to be fine but it wasn't. The first two DVDs I tried locked up or pixelated every few seconds after 2 minutes or so into the movies. I then put them back in the box and proceeded to try to find a telephone number for customer service for Amazon, can anyone tell me where that is? It is not apparent on the website anywhere so I had to Google to get a phone number (which was dead) and finally found an email link that worked, because I got a return email with another email link and a phone number. The man who answered had an Indian accent so strong I could barely understand anything he said and he must have thought I was dumb for not understanding my native language which he thought he spoke well. I am sure his english is much better than my hindi! Anyway, it was very frustrating communication but he tried his best to give good customer service. I received good copies of my requested DVDs within three days of my phone call but was very irritated when I had to pay return postage on a substandard product. I had already paid postage once before and now I am paying it again? Talk about adding insult to injury! It was never explained to me that I would be credited the shipping once it was returned (that would have placated me for the moment)I repeat this was my first (and hopefully last)bad experience with Amazon. Amazon did make good on the product which is very good and a clear replication of the original. They did make good on refunding my second time postage charge and I am satisfied with my purchase but would not wish the return experience on anyone. In fairness to Amazon, I have probably spent a few thousand $$s on their products and this is my first bad experience.",4,1st bad experience with Amazon,1246665600,"07 4, 2009",2009,1948,"['have', 'ordered', 'many', 'things', 'Amazon', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'satisfied', 'past', 'time', 'however', 'was', 'experience', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'repeat', 'like', 'old', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'movies', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Captain', 'Blood', 'Sea', 'Hawk', 'etc.so', 'ordered', 'set', 'expecting', 'everything', 'be', 'fine', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'two', 'DVDs', 'tried', 'locked', 'up', 'pixelated', 'few', 'seconds', '2', 'minutes', 'so', 'movies', 'then', 'put', 'back', 'box', 'proceeded', 'try', 'find', 'telephone', 'number', 'customer', 'service', 'Amazon', 'can', 'anyone', 'tell', 'where', 'not', 'apparent', 'website', 'anywhere', 'so', 'had', 'Google', 'get', 'phone', 'number', 'was', 'dead', 'finally', 'found', 'email', 'link', 'worked', 'got', 'return', 'email', 'email', 'link', 'phone', 'number', 'man', 'who', 'answered', 'had', 'Indian', 'accent', 'strong', 'could', 'barely', 'understand', 'anything', 'said', 'must', 'have', 'thought', 'was', 'dumb', 'not', 'understanding', 'native', 'language', 'thought', 'spoke', 'well', 'am', 'sure', 'english', 'much', 'better', 'hindi', 'Anyway', 'was', 'very', 'frustrating', 'communication', 'tried', 'best', 'give', 'good', 'customer', 'service', 'received', 'good', 'copies', 'requested', 'DVDs', 'three', 'days', 'phone', 'call', 'was', 'very', 'irritated', 'when', 'had', 'pay', 'return', 'postage', 'substandard', 'product', 'had', 'already', 'paid', 'postage', 'once', 'now', 'am', 'paying', 'again', 'Talk', 'adding', 'insult', 'injury', 'was', 'never', 'explained', 'would', 'be', 'credited', 'shipping', 'was', 'returned', 'would', 'have', 'placated', 'moment', 'repeat', 'was', 'first', 'hopefully', 'last', 'bad', 'experience', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'did', 'make', 'good', 'product', 'very', 'good', 'clear', 'replication', 'original', 'did', 'make', 'good', 'refunding', 'second', 'time', 'postage', 'charge', 'am', 'satisfied', 'purchase', 'would', 'not', 'wish', 'return', 'experience', 'anyone', 'fairness', 'Amazon', 'have', 'probably', 'spent', 'few', 'thousand', 's', 'products', 'first', 'bad', 'experience']",The Errol Flynn Signature Collection - Volume 1: (Captain Blood / The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex / The Sea Hawk / They Died with Their Boots On / Dodge City / and more)

885099,A3UUF0T87UNS9R,B0007OY2PS,argytunes,"[0, 0]","There are currently 3 Errol Flynn Signature Collections available.  2 of them have been on my Amazon Wishlist for several years---simply because their prices were waaay too high!  Once the price got to the &#34;I think I can afford this without starving&#34; stage, I bought the 1st one---which includes 5 Flynn Favorites and a 6th DVD with THE ERROL FLYNN Documentary.Without repeating terms like 'swashbuckler', 'a ladies' man' or the always popular &#34;In Like Flynn&#34;...let's just say that the DVD Biography covers the rise and fall of a star who literally had it all, but threw it away.  His film exploits were only equalled by his personal demons.  So if you don't know a great deal about the actor, you might want to save THE ADVENTURES OF ERROL FLYNN for last.The 5 movies...all of which are hosted by Leonard Maltin (in the &#34;Warner Night at the Movies&#34; segment) include:CAPTAIN BLOOD:  The film that set the standard when it came to pirate adventures on the high seas.  Captain Peter Blood was also the role that alerted movie lovers to the chemistry of Flynn and his frequent co-star, Olivia DeHavilland.  Director Michael Curtiz knew how to get the best out of them both...as well as charactor actors Basil Rathbone (who was actually a better swordsmen than Errol), Guy Kibbee, and Lionel Atwill.  It's 2 hours well spent.THE PRIVATE LIVES OF ELIZABETH &  ESSEX is another Michael Curtiz directoral work of art.  The major differences here are technicolor and a co-star (Bette Davis) who had to love Robert of Essex (Flynn) on-screen, but reportedly loathed him once Director Curtiz yelled &#34;CUT!&#34;  Maybe it was poetic justice that the Earl of Essex had a short lifespan?  Still...the supporting cast (which includes Donald Crisp, Vincent Price, and Henry Stephenson) and the marvelous Erich Wolfgang Korngold Score bring lots of dignity to the Maxwell Anderson Play.THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON is the fatal story of 7th Calvary led by General George Armstrong Custer (who else but Errol Flynn).  I wasn't around when this incident took place, but I kept asking myself if Custer was a hero or an idiot?  Maybe he was a combination of both?  Once again Flynn's love interest is Olivia DeHavilland.  [This was their 8th and final film together].  But Olivia really didn't add much except marquee value. Speaking of which, Executive Producer, Hal Wallis surrounded the 2 leads with terrific character actors including Arthur Kennedy, Charley Grapewin, Hattie MacDaniel, Sydney Greenstreet, and a very young Anthony Quinn!  The Max Steiner music...Black + White Photography...and Director Raoul Walsh offer the traditional Warner Bros historical touch.  However, I found myself starting to get a little sleepy before the 2nd hour was over. [The film's running time is 139 minutes].  But I've only seen the film once so perhaps I'm due for 'an instant replay?'THE SEA HAWK was made 5 years after CAPTAIN BLOOD.  By this time, Errol Flynn had the high seas at his command!  This is probably one of his best.  Portraying Captain Geoffrey Thorpe, Errol goes from captive to commander during the course of the film.  Considering the fact that THE SEA HAWK was made and released during World War II, movie lovers needed a hero to root for. This was Flynn's 10th film with Director Michael Curtiz and it's obvious both star and director were in sync with one another. I'm not quite sure how Flynn ended up with Brenda Marshall as his leading lady?  But Claude Rains, Donald Crisp and Alan Hale definitely were perfect in this.  Flora Robson as Queen Elizabeth?  Absolutely Marvellous.  Her Queen Elizabeth smacks of dignity.  Ditto the terrific music by Erich Wolfgang Korngold.  This is probably THE BEST of the 5 movies in this collection.DODGE CITY:  That's right, partners, Errol puts on the sheriff's badge and matches wits with cattle rustlers, corrupt hombres, and Ann Sheriden.  [This beautiful technicolor feature brings out her firey temper not to mention her lovely red hair]. Trading his sword for a six-shooter, Errol and Director, Michael Curtiz clean up a tough western town with a dash of light hearted humor.  And yep...Dodge City is filled with good guys (Frank McHugh and Henry Travers) as well as bad guys (Bruce Cabot and Victor Jory) , a wonderful Max Steiner western music score, and awesome Technicolor.As I mentioned earlier, Film Critic Leonard Maltin introduces the 'Warner Night at the Movies' segments.  While some of the musical shorts are a little lame---Warner Bros has done its best to match some its best cartoons with each Errol Flynn Feature.  There are also new featurettes covering all 5 films.This leaves me with one question: &#34;Will I eventually purchase Volumn 2 of THE ERROL FLYNN SIGNATURE COLLECTION?  Guess it's up to the price Amazon places on it? But aside from a somewhat lengthy THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON...I'm totally happy with this collection.",5,Some Fine Flynn Flicks In this Collection!,1360281600,"02 8, 2013",2013,4923,"['are',

They don't make films so grand and memorable and stirring as these anymore, not least because there's no one about these days who has the gumption and flair to even come near to equalling Flynn's. Moreover, when Olivia de Havilland played opposite Flynn their pairing's movie chemistry was both unique and superb, and it hasn't been equalled before or since their collaborations - even the legendary Hepburn-Tracy pairing doesn't match it because you can see that Hepburn and Tracy having to work at their trade, but de Havilland and Flynn's work together seems utterly effortless and natural.",5,Incomparably Grand Cinema,1223856000,"10 13, 2008",2008,712,"['Errol', 'Flynn', 'cinema', 'career', 'there', 'been', 'anyone', 'equal', 'screen', 'verve', 'brilliance', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'films', 'so', 'grand', 'memorable', 'stirring', 'anymore', 'not', 'least', 'one', 'days', 'who', 'gumption', 'flair', 'even', 'come', 'equalling', 'Flynn', 'Moreover', 'when', 'Olivia', 'de', 'Havilland', 'played', 'opposite', 'Flynn', 'pairing', 'movie', 'chemistry', 'was', 'unique', 'superb', ""n't"", 'been', 'equalled', 'collaborations', 'even', 'legendary', 'Hepburn-Tracy', 'pairing', ""n't"", 'match', 'can', 'see', 'Hepburn', 'Tracy', 'having', 'work', 'trade', 'de', 'Havilland', 'Flynn', 'work', 'together', 'utterly', 'effortless', 'natural']",The Errol Flynn Signature Collection - Volume 1: (Captain Blood / The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex / The Sea Hawk / They Died with Their Boots On / Dodge City / and more)
885101,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B0007OY2PS,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[150, 152]","Errol Flynn was certainly the most colorful star of Hollywood's ""Golden Age"", with a devil-may-care swagger hiding the insecurities of an unhappy childhood, reckless lifestyle, and desperate desire to achieve respect as an actor, and not just a swashbuckler in tights. Flynn could be sweet and courteous, an arrogant bully, a roue and bon vivant, a restless adventurer, a loyal friend, or an unreliable ""royal pain"", depending on who you spoke to (and when). His sexual exploits were legendary, as were his capacities for alcohol and drugs (all of which were truly remarkable, considering the poor health he endured throughout his life, despite his robust on-screen appearance). Ultimately, whether you loved or hated his lifestyle, his film work, during nearly eighteen years under contract to Warner Brothers, includes some of the most extraordinary, entertaining classics ever made, and his charisma continues to enchant audiences!Sadly, few of Flynn's films have appeared, thus far, on DVD (the best being a superb ""Adventures of Robin Hood"" DVD, released last year). This new collection, while a mixed bag, does finally give DVD audiences a chance to savor two signature Flynn performances, in ""Captain Blood"" (his breakthrough starring role) and ""The Sea Hawk"" (one of the greatest swashbucklers ever made). The rest of the collection lacks the luster of these films, but are certainly worthwhile; ""The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex"" teams Flynn with Bette Davis (who despised him, and fought to get Laurence Olivier for Essex), and, with ""The Sea Hawk"", shows Flynn playing opposite two very different interpretations of Queen Elizabeth; ""They Died with Their Boots On"", Raoul Walsh's fanciful biopic of George Armstrong Custer, offers a slam-bang, if inaccurate, version of the Little Big Horn, and the last teaming of Flynn and his favorite leading lady, Olivia de Havilland (""Captain Blood"" was their first of eight films together); ""Dodge City"" represented a major gamble, as Warners had no idea if audiences would accept Tasmanian Flynn as a cowboy in the Old West (they did, and Flynn would make seven more westerns, over the next ten years...actually making more westerns than swashbucklers or war movies!). While I'd have preferred seeing ""The Dawn Patrol"", ""The Adventures of Don Juan"", and ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"", in this collection, the choice of films does show Flynn at his most gloriously handsome!Best of all, TCM has produced ""The Adventures of Errol Flynn"", a long-overdue biography, which is included in the package. Along with interviews with his family and friends, including extensive interviews with de Havilland, wives Patrice Wymore and Nora Eddington (in archival footage), and daughter Deirdre, it offers 'behind-the-scenes' footage, private home movies, and material never before seen by the public (including footage from the never-completed ""William Tell""), which makes this a 'must' for Flynn fans.While it will probably be years before all of Errol Flynn's films reach DVD, this collection offers an excellent introduction to a true Hollywood ""Original"", and is well worth owning!",5,Flynn Collection a 'Must' for Fans...,1111708800,"03 25, 2005",2005,3136,"['Errol', 'Flynn', 'was', 'certainly', 'most', 'colorful', 'star', 'Hollywood', 'Golden', 'Age', 'devil-may-care', 'swagger', 'hiding', 'insecurities', 'unhappy', 'childhood', 'reckless', 'lifestyle', 'desperate', 'desire', 'achieve', 'respect', 'actor', 'not', 'just', 'swashbuckler', 'tights', 'Flynn', 'could', 'be', 'sweet', 'courteous', 'arrogant', 'bully', 'roue', 'bon', 'vivant', 'restless', 'adventurer', 'loyal', 'friend', 'unreliable', 'royal', 'pain', 'depending', 'who', 'spoke', 'when', 'sexual', 'exploits', 'were', 'legendary', 'were', 'capacities', 'alcohol', 'drugs', 'were', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'considering', 'poor', 'health', 'endured', 'life', 'robust', 'on-screen', 'appearance', 'Ultimately', 'loved', 'hated', 'lifestyle', 'film', 'work', 'nearly', 'eighteen', 'years', 'contract', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'most', 'extraordinary', 'entertaining', 'classics', 'ever', 'made', 'charisma', 'enchant', 'audiences', 'Sadly', 'few', 'Flynn', 'films', 'have', 'appeared', 'thus', 'far', 'DVD', 'best', 'being', 'superb', 'Adventures', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'DVD', 'released', 'last', 'year', 'new', 'collection', 'mixed', 'bag', 'finally', 'give', 'DVD', 'chance', 'savor', 'two', 'signature', 'Flynn', 'performances', 'Captain', 'Blood', 'breakthrough', 'starring', 'role', 'Sea', 'Hawk', 'one', 'greatest', 'swashbucklers', 'ever', 'made', 'rest', 'collection', 'luster', 'films', 'are', 'certainly', 'worthwhile', 'Private', 'Lives', 'Elizabeth', 'Essex', 'teams', 'Flynn', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'who', 'despised', 'fought', 'get', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'Essex', 'Sea', 'Hawk', 'Flynn', 'playing', 'opposite', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'interpretations', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'Died', 'Their', 'Boots', 'Raoul', 'Walsh', 'fanciful', 'biopic', 'George', 'Armstrong', 'Custer', 'slam-bang', 'inaccurate', 'version', 'Little', 'Big', 'Horn', 'last', 'teaming', 'Flynn', 'favorite', 'leading', 'lady', 'Olivia', 'de', 'Havilland', 'Captain', 'Blood', 'was', 'first', 'eight', 'films', 'together', 'Dodge', 'City', 'represented', 'major', 'gamble', 'Warners', 'had', 'idea', 'audiences', 'would', 'accept', 'Tasmanian', 'Flynn', 'cowboy', 'Old', 'West', 'did', 'Flynn', 'would', 'make', 'seven', 'more', 'westerns', 'next', 'ten', 'years', 'actually', 'making', 'more', 'westerns', 'swashbucklers', 'war', 'movies', ""'d"", 'have', 'preferred', 'seeing', 'Dawn', 'Patrol', 'Adventures', 'Don', 'Juan', 'Charge', 'Light', 'Brigade', 'collection', 'choice', 'films', 'show', 'Flynn', 'most', 'gloriously', 'handsome', 'Best', 'TCM', 'produced', 'Adventures', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'long-overdue', 'biography', 'included', 'package', 'interviews', 'family', 'friends', 'including', 'extensive', 'interviews', 'de', 'Havilland', 'Patrice', 'Wymore', 'Nora', 'Eddington', 'archival', 'footage', 'daughter', 'Deirdre', ""'behind-the-scenes"", 'footage', 'private', 'home', 'movies', 'material', 'never', 'seen', 'public', 'including', 'footage', 'never-completed', 'William', 'Tell', ""'must"", 'Flynn', 'fans.While', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'years', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'films', 'reach', 'DVD', 'collection', 'excellent', 'introduction', 'true', 'Hollywood', 'Original', 'well', 'worth', 'owning']",The Errol Flynn Signature Collection - Volume 1: (Captain Blood / The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex / The Sea Hawk / They Died with Their Boots On / Dodge City / and more)

The only other Flynn titles I could get on DVD before this was ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"", ""Burma"", ""Master of Ballantrae"", and ""Sante Fe Trail"". Any fan of Flynn's or just rousing adventures will want this collection. Signature's collections are decently transferred. The movies ""Sea Hawk"" and ""Captain Blood"" to me are worth the price alone. These were two of his greatest movies. Fans won't be disappointed. Anyone that thinks they need colorized just doesn't appreciate these wonderful classic B&W movies and they don't deserve them. This set is magnificently restored to new quality. Probably better than they were ever seen in theater or television. All the extras included make it a set that any fan will have to have and most others would be happy to buy or get as a present. I was fascinated by the documentaries and commentaries about the movies and Errol Flynn. Each movie contains a Leonard Maltin intro, a Newsreel, Short Subject, and Cartoon for the year the movie was made. A couple even have an extra short with some music from a band of the era. I kid you not when I say these DVDs are the best restoration of old classics that I have seen yet. I highly recommend this series to anyone that enjoyed Errol Flynn or anyone that enjoys adventure or western movies. Two of the movies are in color, ""The Private Lifes of Elizabeth and Essex"" and ""Dodge City"". The other three are in black and white. They are all wonderful movies. It has been wonderful seeing these movies again with sharp picture and sound that I never saw when they were televised.

885104,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B0007OY2PS,Chrijeff,"[1, 1]","...I'd have given this box-set five stars.  But what it is, is a good comprehensive collection of the early work of a charismatic and very popular actor who probably defined ""swashbuckler"" for all time (not even Doug Fairbanks Sr. could quite match his style).  You should first watch the earliest title,Captain Blood, released when Flynn was only 26.  Teaming with several people important in his career (director Michael Curtiz, villain Basil Rathbone, and female co-star Olivia deHavilland), he brings to life Rafael Sabatini's probably best-known hero, an Irish physician unjustly condemned for treason after getting unwillingly swept into the English civil wars of the 17th century.  Shipped to the West Indies as a slave and bought by the niece (deHavilland) of a sugar planter (Lionel Atwill), he eventually contrives to mastermind a mass escape and steal a ship, becoming a pirate chief who will be appreciated by any fan of Johnny Depp in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise.Four years later Flynn appeared in his first Western,Dodge City, again with Curtiz and deHavilland, as well as Alan Hale, who had played Little John to his Robin inThe Adventures of Robin Hood [Blu-ray].  Despite the Irish lilt in his voice he makes a completely plausible soldier-of-fortune-gone-West, Wade Hatton, who after experience as a buffalo hunter for the rail crews and a Texas trail boss (both before and after the Civil War, in which he also fought), reluctantly takes on the task of taming the Queen of Cowtowns.  (Of course, like most Westerns of the era, this storyline plays hob with history, but you might be able to suspend your disbelief by assuming that this is an alternate Universe in which Hatton basically substitutes for most of the men who *did* wear the badge in Dodge--much as James Arness did in the long-running TV seriesGunsmoke - The First Season.)  There's plenty of action, a smooth villain (Bruce Cabot) and two rougher ones (Victor Jory, Ward Bond), sympathetic good characters (Frank McHugh as newspaper editor Joe Clemons, Henry Travers as deHavilland's uncle Dr. Irving), and two great sidekicks for Hatton, the perennial Alan Hale as Rusty Hart and Guinn ""Big Boy"" Williams as Tex Baird, plus a romance with deHavilland.In the same year Flynn filmedThe Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex [VHS] with Bette Davis.  They didn't get along, and I fear it shows, besides the fact that the film, adapted from Maxwell Anderson's stage play, is very slow.  Though Flynn could do romance very creditably, he was best at it when he had an opportunity to cream the bad guys in between embraces, and this he doesn't have here.  I ended up turning off the player after about 45 minutes; I just couldn't get into the movie.  Even the presence of Curtiz and deHavilland couldn't save it for me.The following year cameThe Sea Hawk, with Flynn returning to Elizabethan England (teamed with a much more compatible Queen, Flora Robson, plus his pal Curtiz once again, and Hale as sidekick Carl Pitt, a gunner aboard ship) as one of the ""sea dogs"" who made that country a power to reckon with on the high seas.  Geoffrey Thorpe must cope with Spaniards, traitorous members of his Queen's court, and a beautiful half-Spanish, half-English woman (Brenda Marshall as Dona Maria).  As in ""Captain Blood,"" this movie was filmed in black and white, which is a pity, but it also offers wonderful shipboard battle scenes, intrigue, and two very smooth villains (Claude Rains as Marshall's uncle, a Spanish diplomat, and Henry Daniell as the traitorous Lord Wolfingham; one wonders why they didn't put Rathbone in this role).The last of the movies in the set is 1941'sThey Died With Their Boots On, Flynn's first team-up with director Raoul Walsh and last with deHavilland (who plays Elizabeth Bacon Custer).  Flynn's Custer is just what you might expect: flamboyant, hungry for fame, often impulsive, but utterly without fear--whether it's of Confederate soldiers, Indians, his superior officers, or President U. S. Grant.  (And it's completely true that he came from ""the wrong side of the tracks"" in the same Michigan town as his Libby, who was the daughter of a very wealthy local man who disapproved the match.)  Again, it's too bad the picture was filmed in black and white, but the battle scenes are wonderful, and the chemistry between the leads is undeniable.As a bonus the set includes a Turner documentary, ""The Adventures of Errol Flynn,"" which provides background on the actor's roots, early life, and career, as well as his rather tragic death at 50, worn out by alcohol and morphine.  There are interviews with an assortment of people ranging from deHavilland to widow Patrice Wymore and daughter Deirdre to Burt Reynolds and Richard Dreyfuss, including quite a few from what must have been an earlier (1977) biography.I think this set would have been much more satisfying if instead of ""Elizabeth & Essex"" it had includedThe Prince and the Pauper, but with that reservation it still makes a great introduction to an iconic figure of early sound pictures.",4,If it were only all swashbucklers...,1271980800,"04 23, 2010",2010,5071,"[""'d"", 'have', 'given', 'box-set', 'five',

885106,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,B0007OY2PS,Douglas M,"[7, 8]","Once again, Warner Brothers have done a great job issuing 5 excellent films of the magnetic Errol Flynn. For a ten year period, from 1935 to 1945, Flynn reigned highly at the box office before his personal life began to effect his work and appearance. These films are all from his peak.- ""Captain Blood"", released in 1935, is a stirring swashbuckler which launched his stardom and his screen partnership with the beautiful and talented Olivia de Havilland.- ""Dodge City"" from 1939 is an all encompassing Western with all stops pulled out. Bar room brawls, beautiful vistas of wide open spaces, a steam train chase, a cattle stampede and more are here in glorious technicolour. Flynn was not a natural western star with his English/Australian accent but plot contrivances allow for that.- In 1939, ""The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex"" was really a Bette Davis vehicle and Flynn flounders against Davis's intensity.- For 1940, the long awaited follow up to ""Captain Blood"" appeared. ""The Sea Hawk"" is superior in every way including Flynn's growth in self confidence.- Made in 1942, ""They Died with their Boots on"" is a fictional tale of General Custer and Flynn is his usual heroic self but not really convincing as a real historical figure. This was his last film with an overweight De Havilland and their relationship is very moving here.The prints are excellent but ""Captain Blood"" shows some wear and tear. Michael Curtiz masterfully directed all but ""Boots"" when Flynn would no longer work with him. Raoul Walsh took over and maintained the standard. In every film, Flynn's sense of humour and charm come through and 4 of them benefit from the presence of de Havilland. The supporting casts are outstanding. Each disc includes a worthwhile featurette about the film and the theatrical trailer. Some have short films and cartoons. Best of all, the outstanding documentary, ""The Adventures of Errol Flynn"", is included. This benefits from the appearance of his daughter, two of his wives and de Havilland to add authenticity to the story and squash some of the more absurd rumours about him. The story by De Havilland on the set of Robin Hood is hilarious. The films have not really dated because of their period settings and those in technicolour look great.",5,Flynn flies again,1172880000,"03 3, 2007",2007,2267,"['Once', 'again', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'have', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'issuing', '5', 'excellent', 'films', 'magnetic', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'ten', 'year', 'period', '1935', '1945', 'Flynn', 'reigned', 'highly', 'box', 'office', 'personal', 'life', 'began', 'effect', 'work', 'appearance', 'films', 'are', 'peak.-', 'Captain', 'Blood', 'released', '1935', 'stirring', 'swashbuckler', 'launched', 'stardom', 'screen', 'partnership', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'Olivia', 'Havilland.-', 'Dodge', 'City', '1939', 'encompassing', 'Western', 'stops', 'pulled', 'out', 'Bar', 'room', 'brawls', 'beautiful', 'vistas', 'wide', 'open', 'spaces', 'steam', 'train', 'chase', 'cattle', 'stampede', 'more', 'are', 'here', 'glorious', 'technicolour', 'Flynn', 'was', 'not', 'natural', 'western', 'star', 'English/Australian', 'accent', 'plot', 'contrivances', 'allow', 'that.-', '1939', 'Private', 'Lives', 'Elizabeth', 'Essex', 'was', 'really', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'vehicle', 'Flynn', 'flounders', 'Davis', 'intensity.-', '1940', 'long', 'awaited', 'follow', 'up', 'Captain', 'Blood', 'appeared', 'Sea', 'Hawk', 'superior', 'way', 'including', 'Flynn', 'growth', 'self', 'confidence.-', 'Made', '1942', 'Died', 'Boots', 'fictional', 'tale', 'General', 'Custer', 'Flynn', 'usual', 'heroic', 'self', 'not', 'really', 'convincing', 'real', 'historical', 'figure', 'was', 'last', 'film', 'overweight', 'De', 'Havilland', 'relationship', 'very', 'moving', 'here.The', 'prints', 'are', 'excellent', 'Captain', 'Blood', 'wear', 'tear', 'Michael', 'Curtiz', 'masterfully', 'directed', 'Boots', 'when', 'Flynn', 'would', 'no', 'longer', 'work', 'Raoul', 'Walsh', 'took', 'over', 'maintained', 'standard', 'film', 'Flynn', 'sense', 'humour', 'charm', 'come', '4', 'benefit', 'presence', 'de', 'Havilland', 'supporting', 'casts', 'are', 'outstanding', 'disc', 'worthwhile', 'featurette', 'film', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'have', 'short', 'films', 'cartoons', 'Best', 'outstanding', 'documentary', 'Adventures', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'included', 'benefits', 'appearance', 'daughter', 'two', 'wives', 'de', 'Havilland', 'add', 'authenticity', 'story', 'squash', 'more', 'absurd', 'rumours', 'story', 'De', 'Havilland', 'set', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'hilarious', 'films', 'have', 'not', 'really', 'dated', 'period', 'settings', 'technicolour', 'look', 'great']",The Errol Flynn Signature Collection - Volume 1: (Captain Blood / The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex / The Sea Hawk / They Died with Their Boots On / Dodge City / and more)

A really lovely tribute to a great and entertaining actor and interesting person. Errol definitly has the screen presensce, charisma, and great acting abilities. He is great with a sword and in swashbuckling, and just as good I think in westerns. Each one he really seems to bring the time and era to the film and fits in well with it, in costume and in acting.

885124,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B0007OY2PS,Tim Janson,"[9, 10]","The Adventures of Robin Hood Special Edition DVD that came out a couple of years ago was simply one of the greatest DVDs ever.  But Flynn's films have been slow to come out on DVD and so it makes this set a veritable treasure chest for the dashing Flynn.  The great thing is that Warner Bros. didn't go on the cheap and just throw these five films on disc...as with Robin Hood they are givig us a number of extras with the collector in mind.  Again they have Leonard Maltin introducing each feature with the Warner Night at the Movies with short features and cartoons so you can simulate what it would have been like to go to the theater back in the era.  This is really a great touch.  Add to that each film has been re-mastered and looks fantastic.  Also included is the outstanding new TCM documentary on Flynn.  I had just seen this on TV a few weeks ago and it was just magnificent and features interviews with Olivia De Haviland, Flynn's daughter and former wives, and others who worked with the star.  Absolutely fascinating!Besides Robin Hood, my two favorite Flynn Films are Captain Blood & The Sea Hawk.  In Captain Blood from 1935, Flynn plays Dr. Peter Blood, an English physician unjustly convicted of treason and sentenced to slavery in the West Indies. Relying on only courage and brains, he escapes from his captors and becomes the legendary pirate known as Captain Blood, a brilliant swordsman and seaman whose crew is comprised of several of his fellow former slaves. Olivia de Havilland plays Arabella Bishop, the dashing pirate captain's romantic interest (and niece of the evil plantation owner and slaver, Colonel Bishop, who is played by Lionel Atwill). Sparks fly between Captain Blood and Arabella as their tempestuous relationship builds, and the conflict between Blood and builds as well as the pirate captain and his crew start to not only believe that they can fight Colonel Bishop, but they can win . . . .Basil Rathbone did his usual fine job as Flynn's rival (except for his attempt at a French accent!) Captain Levasseur. Also along is long time Flynn drinking buddy Alan Hale. The Young Olivia De Havilland, has never looked more beautiful, and you can see the chemistry between her and Flynn almost immediately. They would go on to star in seven more films together!!The Sea Hawk, 1940 - Along with Captain Blood and The Adventures of Robin Hood, The Sea Hawk completes a grand trilogy of Flynn Swashbucklers and forever cemented his role as the king of that genre. Rousing action and grand battle scenes highlight this film as Flynn plays Captain Thorpe, an English privateer who is secretly given permission by Queen Elizabeth to attack Spanish ships in anticipation of war between the two countries. To the rest of the world, Thorpe is still a pirate, however.The specatacular opening sequence has Thorpe and his crew capturing a Spanish Galleon and taking the booty back to England. Thorpe soon finds himself attracted to the daughter of Spain's new ambassador Dona Maria Alvarez de Cordoba played by Brenda Marshall, making for some fun scenes. But England's devious Lord Wolfingham is in league with the Spanish and helps set a trap for Thorpe and his crew, ultimately capturing them and chaining them aboard a Spanish ship. Thorpe and his crew must now free themselves and hope to get back to England to help rescue them from the Spanish attack.Flora Robson is absolutely brilliant as Queen Elizabeth, capturing the look that we've always seen in paintings of that famous ruler. Flynn's good friend and drinking buddy Alan Hale again is along for the ride as first mate Carl Pitt. The chemistry between these two was always magnificent. The only real cast weak link was Henry Daniell as Lord Wolfingham. He simply could not compete with Basil Rathbone as Flynn's villianous foe.The film was directed by Michael Curtiz, one of the finest directors of the 30's and 40's and who had already directed Flynn in Captain Blood, Charge of the Light Brigade, and The Adventures of Robin Hood. He and Flynn often clashed but there's no denying that Curtiz always got the best out of Flynn.I don't think you can argue much with any of the films included in this collection although I personally would like to have seen ""Charge of the Light Brigade"", ""The Prince and the Pauper"" or ""Objective Burma"" over the ""Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex"" since I'm not a big Bette Davis fan.

885125,A1C80B497LCYKA,B0007OY2PS,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[4, 4]","When Errol Flynn was asked to be a cowboy in a western, at first he thought Warner Brothers was kidding. After all, he was the ultimate swashbuckler. Could he really trade in his sword and bow for a six-shooter and be believable?The movie was DODGE CITY and the director was Michael Curtiz (Casa Blanca). Curtiz was known for big, sprawling, explosive productions that pulled out all the stops and left you breathless. That's just what he did in DODGE CITY, and it is magnificent.DODGE CITY is the story of the town that men like Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday made famous. It was a town that was the epitome of the wild West at its wildest. There was no law and order. The big cattle companies came there to sell their beef, and, once there, the cowboys saw it only as a place to have a good time. So, it was no place to raise a family.Into that town come two cowboys on a drive - trail boss Wade Hatton (Errol Flynn) and his sidekick Rusty (Alan Hale - Gilligan's Island) - and what they find is blatant murder and robbery by the man running the town - Jeff Surrett, played by Bruce Cabot, who holds a grudge against Wade for turning him in for poaching. Ann Sheridan plays Cabot's floozy girlfriend, and Olivia de Havilland plays Abbie Irving, one of the members of a wagon train that accompanied Wade and his men on the trail. While on the trail, there was an incident between Wade and Abbie's drunken brother that ended in his death. Now Abbie, too, has a grudge against Wade.This film has everything: a cattle stampede, a race between a train and a stagecoach, a barroom brawl, several attempted hangings, lots of shootouts, a runaway wagon, an Indian attack, a train wreck - one exciting event after another, and most of them the first time ever on that scale, and in color. This is the film that all the others copied. When it premiered in the present day Dodge City, it was the biggest premier of any film to date.You gotta see this one cowboys and cowgirls. And, would you believe it: you can buy it now as part of the Errol Flynn Collection on Amazon for only $29.97 (that's six films for less than $5 each) - or, by itself for $9.97. When I put this one into my DVD player, I have to admit I had my doubts about ol' Errol pulling it off - but he's great, and the movie is magnificent. They don't get much better than this, and they don't get much better than this collection. A lot of collections will give you a couple of an actor's best films and then fill it out with his lesser films; but not this one. The only Errol Flynn essential film this collection is missing is THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD. So, if you have that one and this collection, you have the best of Errol Flynn. Plus, his bio.

885126,A3GUNXVYK34085,B0007OY2PS,William F. Flanigan Jr.,"[13, 21]","The collection consists of six disks--five are truly classic films; the sixth is the collection's bonus disk.  Sound (with one exception) is glorious.  But the video is often borderline bootleg.  Each film includes a featurette extra. Distinguished film historian, Mr. Rudy Behlmer, leads a panel of people who seem to have done their research.  The editing of the featurettes is clever, but disconcerting.  Often one person will begin a comment (or sentence) with another (sometimes two others) finishing it!1. CAPTAIN  BLOOD (1935)--two stars.  A very old motion picture which looks even older in this DVD version.  End-to-end grain city;  dirt, vertical wear lines, and ""over exposures"" (bright spots on close-ups due to multiple generations of copies) are present throughout.  The last few reels exhibit continuous video digital drop-outs (the lower half of the picture flashes with digital noise) which indicates poor or no DVD production quality control.  However, Erich Wolfgang Korngold's (EWK) film score sounds sumptuous.  It comes through clear and undistorted.  Again, one is reminded how the score defined the film!  Conductor John Mauceri has some interesting insights on EWK's approach to this film symphony (in the featurette).2.  THE PRIVATE LIVES OF ELIZABETH AND ESSEX (1939)--three stars.  Not a swashbuckler, but a costume drama.  And a rather boring drama saved only by EWK's brilliant film score (see below).  This was Flynn's second film in Technicolor, but if you are expecting dazzling, radiate colors (like those in the recent DVD of THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD) you will be sorely disappointed.  The print on this DVD has not been derived from original sources.  It is faded and closely resembles the level of ""color"" that results when a black & white film is colorized.  Fortunately, the sound quality of EWK's score is once again simply stunning.  It is the third (perhaps second) star of this motion picture complete with background and establishing ""shots,"" mid-range ""shots,"" and close-ups--many, many close-ups!  The featurette barely lasts longer than the theatrical trailer!3. THE SEA HAWK (1940)--three stars. This DVD is 127 minutes long ; the laser-disc release of the original UK version (complete with the UK censor's seal) was 128 minutes.  The DVD print has dirt and vertical wear lines on and off during the first 2/3rds of the film.  It's also second-generation grainy, but often it's hard to judge just how poor the video quality is due to the extensive use of rear projections and soft lensing when the female lead appears in close-ups.  These are grainy/fuzzy to start with!  The sound is all treble for the first 3-4 reels; then some bass ""shows up.""  EWK's  music sounds great, especially after the bass comes in.  What we have here is the definite, swashbuckler film score of the first half of the 20th Century!4.  DODGE CITY (1939)--three stars.  Another faded version of what was originally released in Technicolor.  Plenty of grain, especially noticeable with shots that include the sky (which is quite often).  Again, the sound is superb with Max Steiner's  powerful score providing more than an earful!5.  THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON (1941)--three stars.  Flynn and de Havilland's last picture together.  Again, it's grain-city end-to-end with periodic dirt and close-up bright spots in the second-hand print used for this disk.  The sound is also distorted (especially during the loud passages that accompany major action scenes).6.  THE ADVENTURES OF ERROL FLYNN (2004)--four stars. This was a Turner production apparently shown on TV last year.  It presents a very different, benign (rehabilitated?) view of Flynn.  Quite the contrary to Flynn's own words (both written and spoken) and a boat-load of autobio books written by folks who knew Flynn well (or so they claim).William Flanigan, Ph.D.",3,Terrific movies!

885127,A1JJK67VXR1WSR,B0007OY2PS,William R. Hancock,"[73, 75]","Okay, here it is. Strait up. I adore Errol Flynn. Always have, always will. Can't remember which of his films I saw first on television years ago (though my little grey brain cells keep whispering ""They Died With Their Boots On""), but whatever it was, it made me instantly a Flynn junkie and I have remained so ever since. It is hard to say which of the ""Tasmanian Devil's"" movies I like the best, though I'm inclined to believe it is a toss-up between ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" and ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" (this awesome film amazingly MISSING from this ""signature"" collection...and it's unfathomable absence the priciple reason I have rated this collection as only 4 stars instead of 5). How does one have an Errol Flynn ""signature"" collection with ""Charge of the Light Brigade"" so glaringly unincluded? Boggles the mind.  One would hope Turner Classics would produce a ""Volume II"" to this, a follow-up that would feature ""Light Brigade"", ""The Dawn Patrol"", ""Gentleman Jim"",""Adventures of Don Juan"", and one of Joanne Woodward's favorites, ""That Forsyte Woman"" from MGM (or else ""Uncertain Glory"" or ""Edge of Darkness"").It is good to see Flynn coming back ""In"" again (to play on the old ""In like..."" expression). He took a major hit some two decades ago with a most worthless book that became a bestseller (""The Secret Life of Errol Flynn"" by Charles Higham )and smeared his name and reputation mean-spiritedly. This author, Higham, termed Flynn a traitor and Nazi spy and pedophile homosexual, supposedly using ""credible"" witness tesitimony and ""classified documentation"" to bolster his outrageous claims. He had Flynn doing all sorts of things to further the cause of the Reich and hooked him up with secret meetings all across Europe and in the Caribbean with his ""Nazi intelligence controllers"". Among his claims were that Errol used his influence to have secret aerial shots of Pearl Harbor filmed during the production of ""Dive Bomber"", which he funnelled to German Intelligence (""Abwehr""), and thence to the Japanese to help plan their attack.He also had Flynn at a secret nazi confab in the Bahamas with the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and other British traitors. These were only two ""for instances"" of this kind of thing. Then he had Flynn ""spy controlled"" by Dr. Julius Erben, a low-level Abwehr agent....with documents (supposedly) to ""prove"" it.In short order, all Higham's claims came crashing down in the face of REAL research by REAL researchers digging up REAL facts.All the times Higham had Flynn meeting with ""Nazis"" in Europe, he could not have done so, as all the Warner Brothers' shooting logs still exist and Flynn's whereabouts can be tracked meticulously. Higham hadn't counted on that when he began his smear campaign. In fact, on the very day when Highman had Errol ""conspiring"" in the Bahamas with the Windsors, the actor was, in fact, standing on a log across a stream in Chico. California, facing Alan Hale with a quarterstaff while William Keighly directed the meeting of Robin Hood and Little John for ""The Adventures of..."". And, as for ""Dive Bomber"", the Japanese ALREADY HAD their Pearl Harbor mockups built (courtesy of Honolulu spies)and were preparing for the raid WHILE ""DIVE BOMBER"" WAS IN PRODUCTION....AT SAN DIEGO...NOT PEARL HARBOR!!!!Situations like this...CONNIVANCES....turned up everywhere in the Higham book. And the ""documentation"" he offered turned out to be edited out of context, and, in some cases, the blacked out names didn't relate to Flynn at all...Higham just CLAIMED they did. But originals obtained under the Freedom of Information Act proved the distortions here as well. And Dr. Erben? Well he WAS a German agent, but he only knew Flynn briefly, and ,interviewed before his death, he affirmed that Errol had NEVER been a German agent, that he...Erben...had used Flynn's celebrity to gain him access to people, but that Flynn himself never realized he was being used in this manner. It should also be noted that the Abwehr, under Adm. Wilhelm Canaris, worked secretly more AGAINST Hitler's Nazis than FOR them. aided in the assassination plots AGAINST Hitler, and, by war's end, had been disbanded and taken over by the SS and its leaders executed.  In fact there is strong reason to believe Abwehr may have been half-connected to the British Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. So even if Flynn might have UNKNOWINGLY been ""associated"" with this ANTI-Nazi German intelligence organization, that might not have been such a bad thing after all!As to the homosexual pedophile stuff, none other than Flynn's old arch-enemy BETTE DAVIS stepped forward to declare that a ""crock"". Said that sounded like Orry-Kelly malarkey, Orry-Kelly being a Warner's costumer in ""the day"". According to Davis, Kelly delighted in spreading nasty, vicious, hurtful rumors about people who ""crossed him""...and Errol did that from time to time.To have ""Queen Bette"" the Flynn-hater come to his defense was astounding enough, but then the OTHER shoe dropped. JOAN CRAWFORD, Bette Davis' OWN arch enemy, came out BACKING BETTE!!! Crawford, who'd once called Flynn ""The most beautiful man who ever lived"", said the gay stories sounded EXACTLY like something that would come out of Orry-Kelly; that if you'd ever worked at Warners you'd have picked up on it immediately.An amazing happening. Bette Davis defending Errol Flynn and Joan Crawford backing her up. Shades of the Apocalypse.Though now totally discredited among those who KNOW, many uninformed people still are under the impression this hog swill was true.It all needs to be set right. The DVD ""Adventures of Errol Flynn"" in this collection attacks the old tale, Tony Thomas in ""Errol Flynn, The Spy Who Never Was"", demolishes it handily, as does Flynn's stunt double Buster Wiles in ""Errol & Me"". The Walt Disney movie ""The Rocketeer"" unhappily plays with the smear job, featuring Timothy Dalton made up as Flynn (though called ""Neville Sinclair"") and casts him as the dastardly villain Charles Higham worked so to make him appear(and the ""why"" of it has never been learned).  I am a fan of the ""Rocketeer"" movie but this aspect of it has always distressed me.But it looks like Errol's turn is coming around again. This ""Signature Collection"" puts him center stage again and he deserves the limelight. ""Elizabeth & Essex"" lets him act, and ""The Adventures of..."" outlines his life. But ""Captain Blood"", ""The Sea Hawk"", ""They Died With Their Boots On"" and ""Dodge City"" show perfectly what it was he did...and how he did it...that let him charm America and the world.",4,In
