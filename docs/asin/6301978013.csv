287115,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6301978013,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","Meredith Willson's THE UNSINKABLE MOLLY BROWN had its Broadway premiere on 11/3/60. The musical closed on 2/10/62, after 532 performances. Harve Presnell was the only main cast member to also appear in this film version, which is nicely augmented in its first third by striking Rocky Mountain scenery.SYNOPSIS--Poor girl Molly leaves her adopted father's squalid home to seek a wealthy man. She meets and falls in love with unmotivated mine owner Johnny Brown. They marry after he builds a large cabin and furnishes it to Molly's specifications. Soon after $300,000 that he got for sellling his claim gets accidentally burned in a heating stove, Johnny stumbles on a rich gold vein that makes him and Molly multi-millionares. They move to the ritziest street in Denver but are scorned by their snooty neighbors. On the advice of her parish monsignor, Molly travels to Europe to get some culture and polish and drags an unhappy ""J.J."" along. She mingles with bluebloods while he yearns for their little cabin in the sticks.Includes some remarkably energetic dance sequences and a couple of memorable Willson tunes. Flawed, historically inaccurate, but colorful. Recommended to all musical comedy fans.(Note: Co-star Harve Presnell, who makes his big screen debut here, became a great character actor. He was Wlliam H. Macy's cheapskate father-in-law inFARGO, just to name one film.)Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(6.6) The Unsinkable Molly Brown (1964) - Debbie Reynolds/Harve Presnell/Ed Begley/Jack Kruschen/Hermione Badderly/Harvey Lembeck/Audrey Christie/Hayden Rorke/Martita Hunt",4,"Molly Brown: ""It's not the money I love, it's the not having it I hate.""",1288396800,"10 30, 2010",2010,1626,"['Meredith', 'Willson', 'THE', 'UNSINKABLE', 'MOLLY', 'BROWN', 'had', 'Broadway', 'premiere', '11/3/60', 'musical', 'closed', '2/10/62', '532', 'performances', 'Harve', 'Presnell', 'was', 'only', 'main', 'cast', 'member', 'also', 'appear', 'film', 'version', 'nicely', 'augmented', 'first', 'third', 'striking', 'Rocky', 'Mountain', 'scenery.SYNOPSIS', 'Poor', 'girl', 'Molly', 'adopted', 'father', 'squalid', 'home', 'seek', 'wealthy', 'man', 'love', 'unmotivated', 'mine', 'owner', 'Johnny', 'Brown', 'marry', 'large', 'cabin', 'Molly', 'specifications', 'Soon', '300,000', 'got', 'sellling', 'claim', 'accidentally', 'burned', 'heating', 'stove', 'Johnny', 'rich', 'gold', 'vein', 'Molly', 'multi-millionares', 'move', 'ritziest', 'street', 'Denver', 'are', 'scorned', 'snooty', 'neighbors', 'advice', 'parish', 'monsignor', 'Molly', 'Europe', 'get', 'culture', 'polish', 'unhappy', 'J.J.', 'along', 'bluebloods', 'little', 'cabin', 'sticks.Includes', 'remarkably', 'energetic', 'dance', 'sequences', 'couple', 'memorable', 'Willson', 'tunes', 'Flawed', 'historically', 'inaccurate', 'colorful', 'Recommended', 'musical', 'comedy', 'fans', 'Note', 'Co-star', 'Harve', 'Presnell', 'who', 'big', 'screen', 'debut', 'here', 'became', 'great', 'character', 'actor', 'was', 'Wlliam', 'H.', 'Macy', 'cheapskate', 'father-in-law', 'inFARGO', 'just', 'name', 'one', 'film', 'Parenthetical', 'number', 'preceding', 'title', '1', '10', 'imdb', 'viewer', 'poll', 'rating', '6.6', 'Unsinkable', 'Molly', 'Brown', '1964', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds/Harve', 'Presnell/Ed', 'Begley/Jack', 'Kruschen/Hermione', 'Badderly/Harvey', 'Lembeck/Audrey', 'Christie/Hayden', 'Rorke/Martita', 'Hunt']",N/A

287117,ANGH6401L9Y0T,6301978013,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 2]","OK, there's a good bit wrong with this movie. Johnny Brown gets the dumbest songs to sing with his wonderful tenor voice (Harve Presnell), and he's not a great actor. But he's all arms and legs, and makes a good foil for Debbie Reynolds' rowdy dancing. And really, just about everything is overdone. But then they do say that Mollie Brown was indeed quite overdone herself.The movie opens with a baby in a cradle shooting the rapids in a Colorado River, laughing all the way. She eventually runs aground, pulls herself up on the bank and pulls herself erect on a boulder. So she was unsinkable long before she took a trip on the Titanic.Next we see what became of the baby: she was picked up by an Irish Catholic miner who takes her in and raises her as his own. She's a teenager and fighting with the neighbor's boys, all dirty and loud and more boy than girl. Still, she decides that the only thing to do is to make her way to Denver and find a rich husband. Her idea of what constitutes rich at this time is pretty modest: a roof that doesn't leak, a big brass bed, that kind of thing.On the way to the small town of Leadville, Mollie trespasses on the land of Johnny Brown. He's smitten, but she's determined to go on her way. So she goes into Leadville and gets a job in a saloon. The proprietor bought her a glittery dress (which of course she has no idea how to wear) and she sings and fakes playing the piano. She teaches everyone to sing ""Belly Up to the Bar, Boys,"" which was a song her father and his neighbor sang when they got drunk -- which was frequently.Johnny Brown followed her to Leadville because she left her bag in his cabin when she ran off. He had invited her in to have something to eat, but she ran away when she got the idea he was going to try to seduce and/or rape her. So he found her at the saloon, gives her back her bag, and in the course of conversation agrees to stay in Leadville and teach her to read. In the process, they fall in love. But she's still determined to have a rich husband, and rejects him, saying all the things she wants -- a roof that doesn't leak, a stove for heat and a stove to cook on, modest desires like that.So Johnny goes back to his property and builds her a house exactly like she said she wanted, and takes her to see it. When she says she likes it, he goes to the door and calls out, and a bunch of his friends and a ""parson"" show up, having been hiding on the side porches, and she's hustled into marrying Johnny. The best man forgot the ring, so Johnny takes a cigar band off the best man's cigar and uses that for her ring.I'm not going to wreck everything telling you all about it, but later after they are millionaires because Johnny strikes a rich gold vein (very, VERY unrealistic scene where he throws his pickax over his shoulder and it hits a rich vein of gold that just comes tumbling out of the hillside like a slot machine paying off), he buys her a gold and jewels reproduction of the cigar band ring.They go to Europe, and they come back, but she's still not happy with the way Denver society rejects her, so she goes back to Europe without Johnny, who returned to his cabin because he didn't want to go to Europe again with her. When she finally comes home, it's on the Titanic, and then in a lifeboat, where she kept the other passengers alive by sharing her fur coat and teaching them to sing ""Belly Up to the Bar, Boys,"" and basically keeping them from losing faith until they are picked up.She returns to Denver to a rousing welcome, and all ends well. It's corny, and as I said, there are some real flaws, but it's a fun movie, too. I laughed myself silly at the party Mollie threw when she returned from Europe the first time and brought a dozen or so titled Europeans with her to show off to Denver society.",2,"Should Work, But It Doesn't",1337385600,"05 19, 2012",2012,3796,"['OK', 'good', 'bit', 'wrong', 'movie', 'Johnny', 'Brown', 'dumbest', 'songs', 'sing', 'wonderful', 'tenor', 'voice', 'Harve', 'Presnell', 'not', 'great', 'actor', 'arms', 'legs', 'good', 'foil', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'rowdy', 'dancing', 'really', 'just', 'everything', 'overdone', 'then', 'do', 'say', 'Mollie', 'Brown', 'was', 'indeed', 'quite', 'overdone', 'herself.The', 'movie', 'baby', 'cradle', 'shooting', 'rapids', 'Colorado', 'River', 'laughing', 'way', 'eventually', 'aground', 'up', 'bank', 'erect', 'boulder', 'was', 'unsinkable', 'long', 'took', 'trip', 'Titanic.Next', 'see', 'what', 'became', 'baby', 'was', 'picked', 'up', 'Irish', 'Catholic', 'miner', 'who', 'own', 'teenager', 'fighting', 'neighbor', 'boys', 'dirty', 'loud', 'more', 'boy', 'girl', 'Still', 'only', 'thing', 'do', 'make', 'way', 'Denver', 'find', 'rich', 'husband', 'idea', 'what', 'rich', 'time', 'pretty', 'modest', 'roof', ""n't"", 'leak', 'big', 'brass', 'bed', 'kind', 'thing.On', 'way', 'small', 'town', 'Leadville', 'Mollie', 'land', 'Johnny', 'Brown', 'smitten', 'determined', 'go', 'way', 'Leadville', 'job', 'saloon', 'proprietor', 'bought', 'glittery', 'dress', 'course', 'idea', 'how', 'wear', 'sings', 'fakes', 'playing', 'piano', 'everyone', 'sing', 'Belly', 'Up', 'Bar', 'Boys', 'was', 'song', 'father', 'neighbor', 'sang', 'when', 'got', 'drunk', 'was', 'frequently.Johnny', 'Brown', 'followed', 'Leadville', 'left', 'bag', 'cabin', 'when', 'ran', 'off', 'had', 'invited', 'have', 'something', 'eat', 'ran', 'away', 'when', 'got', 'idea', 'was', 'going', 'try', 'seduce', 'and/or', 'rape', 'found', 'saloon', 'back', 'bag', 'course', 'conversation', 'stay', 'Leadville', 'teach', 'read', 'process', 'fall', 'love', 'still', 'determined', 'have', 'rich', 'husband', 'saying', 'things', 'roof', ""n't"", 'leak', 'stove', 'heat', 'stove', 'cook', 'modest', 'desires', 'that.So', 'Johnny', 'back', 'property', 'house', 'exactly', 'said', 'wanted', 'see', 'When', 'door', 'out', 'bunch', 'friends', 'parson', 'show', 'up', 'having', 'been', 'hiding', 'side', 'porches', 'hustled', 'marrying', 'Johnny', 'best', 'man', 'forgot', 'ring', 'so', 'Johnny', 'cigar', 'band', 'best', 'man', 'cigar', 'ring.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'wreck', 'everything', 'telling', 'later', 'are', 'millionaires', 'Johnny', 'rich', 'gold', 'vein', 'very', 'VERY', 'unrealistic', 'scene', 'where', 'pickax', 'shoulder', 'rich', 'vein', 'gold', 'just', 'tumbling', 'hillside', 'slot', 'machine', 'paying', 'off', 'gold', 'jewels', 'reproduction', 'cigar', 'band', 'ring.They', 'go', 'Europe', 'come', 'back', 'still', 'not', 'happy', 'way', 'Denver', 'society', 'back', 'Europe', 'Johnny', 'who', 'returned', 'cabin', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'Europe', 'again', 'When', 'finally', 'home', 'Titanic', 'then', 'lifeboat', 'where', 'kept', 'other', 'passengers', 'alive', 'sharing', 'fur', 'coat', 'teaching', 'sing', 'Belly', 'Up', 'Bar', 'Boys', 'basically', 'keeping', 'losing', 'faith', 'are', 'picked', 'up.She', 'returns', 'Denver', 'rousing', 'welcome', 'ends', 'well', 'corny', 'said', 'are', 'real', 'flaws', 'fun', 'movie', 'too', 'laughed', 'silly', 'party', 'Mollie', 'threw', 'when', 'returned', 'Europe', 'first', 'time', 'brought', 'dozen', 'so', 'titled', 'Europeans', 'show', 'off', 'Denver', 'society']",N/A

She was there when ""old"" Hollywood was strangled.Was Charles Walters angry when he directed this movie?  Cute and spunky and, lets say it, a bit too old, Debbie Reynolds screams, screeches, paws, punches and fights her way all through this big thud of a musical.  Was Debbie angry?  Not according to her: she loved it.  It's a stinker.People who haven't seen it in years say ""oh, I love that movie!"" but then they watch it and say ""oh good gawd please turn it off"".  The musical numbers are not only unmemorable, they are almost unnecessary as Reynolds crashes her way into each of them and then the plot just picks up where the crashing left off.  Or TRIES to pick up.  In the hands of Walters and Reynolds, ""Molly Brown"" is a bit of Auntie Mame, Lucy Ricardo, Leona Helmsley and, most of all, Mike Tyson.

Still, it's a lively and engaging story about a young woman determined to better herself.  Molly Tobin (Debbie Reynolds) was plucked from a swollen river at the age of six months and raised by hard-drinking Shamus Tobin (Ed Begley) as his own.  At 15 she makes up her mind to seek out a better place in life for both of them--which, in the 1880's, means finding a rich husband.  After three days' walk she meets J. J. ""Johnny"" Brown (Presnell), an easygoing young miner who loves the beautiful Colorado countryside and, though he owns a good mine for which he's been offered six figures, takes only enough out of it to live comfortably.  To Molly that's sacrilege, but Johnny has already made up his mind to win her.  In Leadville she finds a job in Christmas Morgan's (Jack Kruschen) saloon as a piano player and dancer--and persuades Johnny to teach her to read and write.  He does--and wins her at last by promising he'll ""never say no"" to her.  But even after he finds the Little Johnny--""the richest mine in the United States""--Molly longs for acceptance by Denver society, and eventually her fixation leads to trouble for the marriage.The original show boasted 18 musical numbers, while this version has only 10, four of which are reprises; but it does have a couple of very lively ensemble dance numbers, and follows the stage script closely.  What makes it work is Molly's hunger to better herself and the way she is progressively seduced by the longing to ""belong.""  (Like another of Reynolds's characters, Lilith Prescott inHow the West Was Won (Ultimate Collector's Edition), Molly is one of those people who can't ""live on love alone"" no matter how much she cares for the man in her life; but unlike Lilith she doesn't know where she has to stop.)

There are many impressive vignettes using  lovely exterior cinematography, most notably the &quot;Denver Society homes&quot; sequence and Reynolds and Presnell's &quot;tree&quot; courtship (featuring the song &quot;I'll Never Say No&quot;). As Molly makes her rags-to-riches transition, her beautiful &quot;nouveau riche&quot; costumes are given an impressive digital enhancement; this is especially evident in the party sequence featuring Reynolds' famous red dress with the million feathers sewn on the top. (The DVD also gives a small postscript on the film's costumes, featuring said dress.)

287135,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6301978013,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 5]","You have to love Debbie Reynolds. Whether it's her youthful zeal inSingin' in the Rain, her over-the-top turn as Grace's ditzy diva mother Bobbi onWill & Grace, or her daughter Carrie's vituperative portrayal of her (and Shirley MacLaine's tough-minded interpretation) in the roman-&agrave;-clef,Postcards from the Edge, Reynolds keeps on ticking with her enduring, all-American brand of foot-stomping peppiness. Based on the1960 Broadway hit, this overlong 1964 musical is arguably her career highpoint since it's a true star vehicle and one of the last of MGM's big musicals that yielded a profit. The 2000 DVD does the film justice with a nice print that captures the vibrancy of the colors and the bombast of the musical arrangements. However, despite a musical score from Meredith Wilson (The Music Man), the problem remains that it's just not a very memorable entertainment. It certainly isn't for lack of Reynolds' all-cylinders-on approach.Directed by Charles Walters and written by Helen Deutsch, the story is a fictionalized biopic of the legendary Molly Brown, an ill-mannered, illiterate backwoods girl intent on leaving her small town of Leadville to marry rich. She meets John Brown, who for no obvious reason is smitten with her, as he teaches her to read and she entertains the miners at the local tavern. They marry, strike it rich in silver and gold mines, and move to fashionable Pennsylvania Avenue in Denver. Shunned by the social register, they go to Europe where Molly is so embraced by royalty that she brings them back to Denver. The Browns hold a big society party which turns into a brawl, and they separate. Coming back from another European trip, Molly survives the sinking of the Titanic and keeps the spirits of her fellow lifeboat passengers up as they await rescue. Yes, this is the same Molly Brown that Kathy Bates portrays in the1997 mega-hit.Fresh off ""The Music Man"", Wilson has written a score that doesn't feature anything close to the gems of his previous hit with ""Belly Up to the Bar, Boys!"" the only one with enough rowdy energy to be considered rousing. In a role ironically slated for MacLaine, Reynolds is rambunctious and performs with exhausting brio, but there's no getting around the fact that Molly is a superficially driven character. I also find it amusing how contemporary she looks in her final scenes. Translating his Broadway role, Harve Presnell evokes Howard Keel's baritone and barrel-chested virility as her husband. With the decline of musicals, he didn't really find success in movies until he played the doomed father-in-law inFargoover three decades later. Titanic aficionados will be disappointed that this part of the story is given short shrift toward the end with recycled footage from 1958'sA Night to Remember. The DVD has the original theatrical trailer and a silly vintage short about the making of one of Reynolds' gowns.

It is widely believed by many that Reynolds was cheated out of a much-deserved Academy Award for Best Actress for this picture. 1964 was the year that the Academy and everyone in Hollywood was feuding and steaming over Jack Warner's decision to cast Audrey Hepburn rather than Julie Andrews in the film version of MY FAIR LADY.  Hepburn was not even nominated for her excellent performance in that film, which won eight Oscars, including ""Best Picture."" But despite the fact that everyone believed that Reynolds gave the best performance that year, fellow nominee Julie Andrews won for her first film, MARY POPPINS, a fluffy role that just required the actors to sing well and stay out of the way of the Disney magical effects work.  Audiences had already voted for Debbie with their box office dollars.  THE UNSINKABLE MOLLY BROWN broke all attendance records everywhere it played, including a record breaking long run at New York's Radio City Music Hall.  Astronauts Gus Grissom and John Young even named their Gemini spacecraft the MOLLY BROWN in honor of their favorite film.  Nearly forty years after the original release of the picture, in most part thanks to theatrical revivals and television showings, most people still associate the character of Molly Brown with Debbie Reynolds, despite the fact that the real Molly Brown was far from being the great beauty as portrayed by Reynolds.  But Reynolds' multi-layered performance captures the essence of what makes Molly such a well-remembered heroine and in the process sings and dances her way into our hearts.  This picture still is great family entertainment and because it is a period piece the film ages well and that accounts for its appeal to this day.From a technical standpoint THE UNSINKABLE MOLLY BROWN on DVD is truly spectacular!  How wonderful it is to hear the Meredith Wilson score in a Dolby Digital sound mix derived from the original multi channel discrete stereo sound.  The bold, sharply etched and beautifully saturated Technicolor restored wide screen (2.35:1) image probably looks better than the inferior Metrocolor original.

Uh-oh, you can see where this review is going...As is so often typical of films portraying actual historical characters, any resemblance this film has to reality is strictly coincidental; there isn't much here that has anything to do with the true-life story of Molly Brown. And that's a shame, because her story would make a good biopic; no need to invent so much of the material. That said, the 1960 Broadway musical was a big hit, and it was perhaps inevitable that the show would make its way to Hollywood. Though, I have to wonder why anyone would buy a property and then delete a full two-thirds of the score that made it so successful in the first place, when transferring the story to film.Now, I do like Debbie Reynolds; she's a capable singer and actress and I've seen her in a few pictures that I've enjoyed very much. Plus, she just seems so darn nice in person! However----while this was one of her favourite roles, I'm sorry to say that I think she is absolutely terrible in this film. Every single scene is played at the top of her lungs to the very back row of the balcony; subtle she isn't. And in the process she reduces Molly to a shrill one-note caricature. I don't think I've ever, in my entire life, seen a major actress in a mainstream motion picture play a role in such an over-the-top, sledgehammer fashion. My mouth was practically hanging open in astonishment as I viewed this picture; I could hardly believe my eyes (or my ears). Yes, I found this film downright painful to watch; I winced my way through it. And even more surprising was the fact that Debbie received an Oscar nomination for her performance---what the heck?!? I'm serious, this was unbelievably bad---and downright annoying.On the plus side, the male lead had an extraordinarily fine singing voice. And the film featured some strikingly beautiful western scenery in the first portion, and many amazingly opulent period costumes and interiors in the latter part; lovely.

Powerful baritone vocals beautifully enhanced by the sound engineers recorded echoes through the Rocky Mountains. One of my most captivating childhood movie memories for that matter. But this is by far Debbie Reynold's all-time cinematic jewel. Based on the real life Molly Brown, a true American rags-to-riches fantasy come true.

287176,A3GLF9XK4AUAHS,6301978013,Robert E. Nylund,"[5, 5]","Many of us have considered ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" to be Debbie Reynolds' best film.  It was first released in the summer of 1964 and was a big hit with audiences and critics, who recognized that it was a wonderful adaptation of Meredith Willson's Broadway musical.  It was about the last musical made by MGM, where Debbie had made a number of musical films during the 1950's.MGM, of course, had begun its slow decline, but this film is top-notch in many ways, despite reports that the studio had to cut a few corners in production, especially in the Titanic sequence, which heavily utilized stock footage from earlier films about the disaster.  However, there was ample on-location filming in Colorado's spectacular mountain wilderness, giving the film a greater visual appeal than the original Broadway production.Debbie's singing, dancing, and acting in the film is awesome.  Her high-spirited performance earned her an Oscar nomination.  She was quite successful in capturing the determined tomboy who will never give up in her pursuit of success.  Her gradual transformation in the role is quite amazing, too.  She is joined by an outstanding support cast, including excellent dancers and singers.  It's really amazing to see veteran character actor Ed Begley, who plays Molly's father, singing and dancing in a film and doing remarkably well.When the first was first released many of were introduced to Harve Presnell, who had starred with Tammy Grimes in the original Broadway production.  Born in Modesto, California, in 1933, Presnell attended San Francisco State College (now San Francisco State University) and distinguished himself not only in the school's musical and drama productions but through work in the San Franciso Opera's Merola Program.  In 1960 Eugene Ormandy utilized Presnell as a baritone soloist in the landmark Columbia recording of Carl Orff's secular cantata ""Carmina Burana.""Presnell might have had a big career in opera and concerts; instead, he utilized his talents on Broadway and in movies.  He later turned to dramatic roles in Hollywood, including an important performance in Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan.""  In this film, however, he was still seemingly young and fresh, often showing a delightful innocence or naivete.  However, he also displayed strength and determination that was equal to Debbie's performance of Molly.  They were clearly well-suited to each other.This is clearly a ""rags-to-riches"" story and the amazing thing is that it is based on truth.  Thelma Ritter portrayed the same character in Twentieth Century Fox's 1953 production of ""Titanic.""  This film tells the full story of how Molly Brown ended up in a lifeboat when the Titanic began to sink.  It delightfully shows how Molly and her husband tried to become part of Denver society, after they struck it rich with the largest discovery of gold in Colorado history.  Naturally, Molly's efforts to succeed and win acceptance create tensions with her husband, adding to the dramatic qualities of the story.This is NOT just another Broadway musical comedy; Meredith Willson included far more drama than he had in his previous hit, ""The Music Man.""  There are comic moments, of course, but the story has greater depth and this film is an excellent adaptation of the hit show.  Sadly, Willson never equaled the success of ""The Music Man"" and ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown.""",5,Debbie Reynolds' best film,1155513600,"08 14, 2006",2006,3394,"['Many', 'have', 'considered', 'Unsinkable', 'Molly', 'Brown', 'be', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'best', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'summer', '1964', 'was', 'big', 'hit', 'audiences', 'critics', 'who', 'recognized', 'was', 'wonderful', 'adaptation', 'Meredith', 'Willson', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'was', 'last', 'musical', 'made', 'MGM', 'where', 'Debbie', 'had', 'made', 'number', 'musical', 'films', ""1950's.MGM"", 'course', 'had', 'begun', 'slow', 'decline', 'film', 'top-notch', 'many', 'ways', 'reports', 'studio', 'had', 'cut', 'few', 'corners', 'production', 'especially', 'Titanic', 'sequence', 'heavily', 'utilized', 'stock', 'footage', 'earlier', 'films', 'disaster', 'However', 'was', 'ample', 'on-location', 'filming', 'Colorado', 'spectacular', 'mountain', 'wilderness', 'giving', 'film', 'greater', 'visual', 'appeal', 'original', 'Broadway', 'production.Debbie', 'singing', 'dancing', 'acting', 'film', 'awesome', 'high-spirited', 'performance', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'was', 'quite', 'successful', 'capturing', 'determined', 'tomboy', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'give', 'up', 'pursuit', 'success', 'gradual', 'transformation', 'role', 'quite', 'amazing', 'too', 'joined', 'outstanding', 'support', 'cast', 'including', 'excellent', 'dancers', 'singers', 'really', 'amazing', 'see', 'veteran', 'character', 'actor', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'who', 'Molly', 'father', 'singing', 'dancing', 'film', 'doing', 'remarkably', 'well.When', 'first', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'many', 'were', 'introduced', 'Harve', 'Presnell', 'who', 'had', 'starred', 'Tammy', 'Grimes', 'original', 'Broadway', 'production', 'Born', 'Modesto', 'California', '1933', 'Presnell', 'attended', 'San', 'Francisco', 'State', 'College', 'now', 'San', 'Francisco', 'State', 'University', 'distinguished', 'not', 'only', 'school', 'musical', 'drama', 'productions', 'work', 'San', 'Franciso', 'Opera', 'Merola', 'Program', '1960', 'Eugene', 'Ormandy', 'utilized', 'Presnell', 'baritone', 'soloist', 'landmark', 'Columbia', 'recording', 'Carl', 'Orff', 'secular', 'cantata', 'Carmina', 'Burana', 'Presnell', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'big', 'career', 'opera', 'concerts', 'instead', 'utilized', 'talents', 'Broadway', 'movies', 'later', 'turned', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'Hollywood', 'including', 'important', 'performance', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'film', 'however', 'was', 'still', 'seemingly', 'young', 'fresh', 'often', 'showing', 'delightful', 'innocence', 'naivete', 'However', 'also', 'displayed', 'strength', 'determination', 'was', 'equal', 'Debbie', 'performance', 'Molly', 'were', 'clearly', 'well-suited', 'other.This', 'clearly', 'rags-to-riches', 'story', 'amazing', 'thing', 'based', 'truth', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'portrayed', 'same', 'character', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'Fox', '1953', 'production', 'Titanic', 'film', 'full', 'story', 'how', 'Molly', 'Brown', 'ended', 'up', 'lifeboat', 'when', 'Titanic', 'began', 'sink', 'delightfully', 'how', 'Molly', 'husband', 'tried', 'become', 'part', 'Denver', 'society', 'struck', 'rich', 'largest', 'discovery', 'gold', 'Colorado', 'history', 'Naturally', 'Molly', 'efforts', 'succeed', 'win', 'acceptance', 'create', 'tensions', 'husband', 'adding', 'dramatic', 'qualities', 'story.This', 'NOT', 'just', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'comedy', 'Meredith', 'Willson', 'included', 'far', 'more', 'drama', 'had', 'previous', 'hit', 'Music', 'Man', 'are', 'comic', 'moments', 'course', 'story', 'greater', 'depth', 'film', 'excellent', 'adaptation', 'hit', 'show', 'Sadly', 'Willson', 'never', 'equaled', 'success', 'Music', 'Man', 'Unsinkable', 'Molly', 'Brown']",N/A

In the ""Golden Age"" we had greats like Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Gene Kelly, Judy Garland, Mickey Rooney, et al where a lot of the films were strictly about the musical numbers, with interchangeable story lines There were some exceptions of course, but after movies like Rodgers and Hammerstein's, ""Oklahoma"", ""Carousel"", ""South Pacific"", and ""The King And I"" in the fifties, we started to see films with more sophisticated story lines and music, where the music and the spoken words blended, and the songs became apart of the story... This is definitely one of them!Debbie Reynold's gives the best performance of her career (Sings, dances and emotes her heart out), and there's a tremendous amount of chemistry between her and Harve Presnell as ""Leadville Johnny Brown"".

287183,A3CJN2S0XLVVLM,6301978013,Silver Screen Videos,"[0, 0]","The Unsinkable Molly Brown is pretty much a showcase for Debbie Reynolds, and her lively, Oscar-nominated performance saves one of the lesser of the lavish Hollywood adaptations of popular Broadway musicals from the 50s and 60s. While classics of the era like West Side Story, My Fair Lady, and The Sound of Music are beloved for their stories as much as their music, Brown works as well as it does only because of Reynolds strutting, singing, and dancing. Ironically, Reynolds lost the Oscar to Julie Andrews in Mary Poppins, a film that is far better regarded today than Molly Brown.Molly Brown was a real life Denver socialite at the turn of the century who gained the &#34;unsinkable&#34; nickname after surviving the sinking of the Titanic (shown briefly in the film). In the movie, she is a saloon entertainer who falls in love with miner Johnny Brown (Harve Presnell) and marries him. When Presnell strikes it rich, the two enter Denver high society, and the results are about what you'd expect. Eventually, Brown has to decide whether wealth and all its trappings or true love is more important (it shouldn't be difficult to guess which decision she makes).Surprisingly, the movie jettisoned most of the Broadway show's songs in favor of playing up the fish-out-of-water laughs. Reynolds is an underrated comedienne and puts a lot of energy into the effort, although she often appears a livelier and lovelier version of Granny Clampett (the Beverly Hillbillies seems to have inspired the direction the movie takes). The songs that do remain, including Belly Up to the Bar, Boys, are quite lively and well done. Plus, the film finds room to display Presnell's vocal talents, which sadly were largely underused in subsequent years.While this isn't one of the great musicals of the era, the film is good fun for the most part, with lavish sets and costuming, a continually entertaining Reynolds, and good use of spectacular outdoor scenery that the stage version obviously couldn't match. For fans of Reynolds, it's a must see, and by far the best use of her musical talents since Singin in the Rain. I'd give it 3 1/2 stars but round it up because those likely to see it are those most enamored of Reynolds' undeniable charm and talent.",4,Debbie Reynolds in Her Liveliest Role,1387670400,"12 22, 2013",2013,2242,"['Unsinkable', 'Molly', 'Brown', 'pretty', 'much', 'showcase', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'lively', 'Oscar-nominated', 'performance', 'one', 'lesser', 'lavish', 'Hollywood', 'adaptations', 'popular', 'Broadway', 'musicals', '50s', '60s', 'classics', 'era', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'My', 'Fair', 'Lady', 'Sound', 'Music', 'are', 'beloved', 'stories', 'as', 'much', 'music', 'Brown', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'Reynolds', 'strutting', 'singing', 'dancing', 'Ironically', 'Reynolds', 'lost', 'Oscar', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'film', 'far', 'better', 'regarded', 'today', 'Molly', 'Brown.Molly', 'Brown', 'was', 'real', 'life', 'Denver', 'socialite', 'turn', 'century', 'who', 'gained', '34', 'unsinkable', '34', 'nickname', 'surviving', 'sinking', 'Titanic', 'shown', 'briefly', 'film', 'movie', 'saloon', 'entertainer', 'who', 'love', 'miner', 'Johnny', 'Brown', 'Harve', 'Presnell', 'When', 'Presnell', 'rich', 'two', 'enter', 'Denver', 'high', 'society', 'results', 'are', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Eventually', 'Brown', 'decide', 'wealth', 'trappings', 'true', 'love', 'more', 'important', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'difficult', 'guess', 'decision', '.Surprisingly', 'movie', 'jettisoned', 'most', 'Broadway', 'show', 'songs', 'favor', 'playing', 'up', 'fish-out-of-water', 'laughs', 'Reynolds', 'underrated', 'comedienne', 'lot', 'energy', 'effort', 'often', 'livelier', 'lovelier', 'version', 'Granny', 'Clampett', 'Beverly', 'Hillbillies', 'have', 'inspired', 'direction', 'movie', 'songs', 'do', 'remain', 'including', 'Belly', 'Up', 'Bar', 'Boys', 'are', 'quite', 'lively', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'room', 'display', 'Presnell', 'vocal', 'talents', 'sadly', 'were', 'largely', 'underused', 'subsequent', 'years.While', ""n't"", 'one', 'great', 'musicals', 'era', 'film', 'good', 'fun', 'most', 'part', 'lavish', 'sets', 'costuming', 'continually', 'entertaining', 'Reynolds', 'good', 'use', 'spectacular', 'outdoor', 'scenery', 'stage', 'version', 'obviously', 'could', ""n't"", 'match', 'fans', 'Reynolds', 'must', 'see', 'far', 'best', 'use', 'musical', 'talents', 'Singin', 'Rain', ""'d"", 'give', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'round', 'up', 'likely', 'see', 'are', 'most', 'enamored', 'Reynolds', 'undeniable', 'charm', 'talent']",N/A

And so, I sat down to enjoy a really poor quality film, just to do it.As the movie progressed, I was able to get past the jerky story-telling and one-dimensional plotline to really start appreciating the main character, Molly Brown.  She reminded me of Reba, and her enthusiasm and energy were unreal!  She bounced back from more let-downs than one could possibly imagine.By the end of the flick, I got the idea that Molly Brown was based on a real person as she had turned up in &quot;Titanic&quot; as a much heavier Kathy Bates.  Her story was unbelievable and very rich, if still somewhat poorly told in this film.In doing a bit of research, I learned alot more about the film.  I think I appreciate what it was setting out to do but am disappointed that they directors seemed more enamored with the frivolous than with the meat of Brown's story.  In the true story, Molly Brown forces her fellow women to row the boats around to pick up drowning survivors from the Titanic.

Fapp. Score by Meredith Wilson.Starring Debbie Reynolds, Harve Presnell, Ed Begley, Jack Kruschen, Hermione Baddeley, Harvey Lembeck, Hayden Roarke, Martita Hunt, Anna Lee and Herb Vigran.The relatively fictionalized musical biography of Margaret Brown Colorado millionairess, her rise from poverty, her romance with John--in real life James--Brown, her efforts to be accepted by the Denver elites, her popularity with the aristocracy of Europe, the difficulties this causes in her down to earth husband and her fateful trip on the steamship the Titanic.Very much a musical epic in the style of OKLAHOMA and THE SOUND OF MUSIC, this is a BIG musical with beautiful photography and vibrant color and fantastic sets. BUT it is also a musical epic in the style of OKLAHOMA and THE SOUND OF MUSIC which is honestly an acquired taste. The first hour is a bit tough sledding with all of this SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS dancing and singing yokels in the wild of Colorado but picks up considerably when the Browns get to Denver and then Europe. Many of the songs are of the OH WHAT A BEAUTIFUL MOOOOORNING variety but there are two/three good dance numbers.The cast is good consisting of a group of character actors who many might know from their genre work----Kruschen from ZELDA THE GREAT of the BATMAN series, Hunt from BRIDES OF DRACULA, Lembeck from the Beach Party movies and Vigran from his work on the ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN series so it is interesting to see them frolicking about in this venue. I did not spot Anna Lee though she is supposed to be in the Titanic sequence. Presnell can certainly sing real purdy. Reynolds---playing a part that would have been Betty Hutton's ten years earlier-- is truly irritating as a back woods type but once she gets to Europe improves mightily though she is very bad on the lifeboat after the Titanic sinks. She can dance and she can sing though. She was nominated for an Oscar.The direction is good and the music okay. One was troubled how this rollicking musical comedy romance would handle the horror of the Titanic. Would there be singing as they sank? No though. The entire sequence using stock footage from A NIGHT TO REMEMBER is not even five minutes and is over before it has begun so anyone looking for a different take on that great tragedy will be disappointed.It is a pleasant viewing experience one supposes. It certainly was not a disagreeable one but it is doubtful if this viewer will ever watch it again.Certainly worth a look if one is inclined.Note. The Browns are buried in a Catholic cemetery on Long Island with a tombstone the size of a small suitcase so one gathers that they got right sick of Colorado and skeedaddled after the credits rolled.
