There is so much of English history within the walls of Westminster Abbey, and, dare I say, would turn the most ardent republican back to a royalist! Most the musical items presented were superb. Carlotte's rendition of two verses of &quot;The Holy City&quot; was a little strained, perhaps due to her youth, but her rendition of &quot;Silent Night&quot; with the seasoned Bryn Terfel was just sheer delight, one of the best I've ever heard. This is not just a video for Christmas, but for any time of the year, when you want to be uplifted and inspired. You will also hear the Queen's english spoken at its best.",5,Glorious,993340800,"06 24, 2001",2001,635,"['video', 'must', 'get', 'so', 'much', 'English', 'history', 'walls', 'Westminster', 'Abbey', 'dare', 'say', 'would', 'turn', 'most', 'ardent', 'republican', 'back', 'royalist', 'Most', 'musical', 'items', 'presented', 'were', 'superb', 'Carlotte', 'rendition', 'two', 'verses', 'quot', 'Holy', 'City', 'quot', 'was', 'little', 'strained', 'perhaps', 'due', 'youth', 'rendition', 'quot', 'Silent', 'Night', 'quot', 'seasoned', 'Bryn', 'Terfel', 'was', 'just', 'sheer', 'delight', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'not', 'just', 'video', 'Christmas', 'time', 'year', 'when', 'want', 'be', 'uplifted', 'inspired', 'will', 'also', 'hear', 'Queen', 'english', 'spoken', 'best']",Christmas Glory From Westminster with Andrea Bocelli and Charlotte Church VHS

557423,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00004XQN2,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[7, 11]","Charlotte Church in my mind is one of the most beautiful spirits alive on the earth today. She has an almost angelic quality about her that always makes me wonder if God stops everything he is doing to listen to her sing. When she sings ""The Holy City"" it gives me shivers just from the pure beauty of her voice.When I listen to Andrea Bocelli, I always close my eyes because there is something spiritual about his voice. While Charlotte and Andrea do make many appearances, the choir is magnificent.One thing I noticed that amused me to no end was when Charlotte Church was singing, the choir boys stood so perfectly it was as if they were enchanted by her. In fact, anyone singing with her seemed to think they had just gone to heaven.A spiritual evening one imagines would be quite wonderful to haveexperienced at the Westminster Abbey in person.~The Rebecca Review",3,Christmas Music and Poetry,1007424000,"12 4, 2001",2001,868,"['Charlotte', 'Church', 'mind', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'spirits', 'alive', 'earth', 'today', 'almost', 'angelic', 'quality', 'always', 'wonder', 'God', 'everything', 'doing', 'listen', 'sing', 'When', 'Holy', 'City', 'shivers', 'just', 'pure', 'beauty', 'voice.When', 'listen', 'Andrea', 'Bocelli', 'always', 'close', 'eyes', 'something', 'spiritual', 'voice', 'Charlotte', 'Andrea', 'do', 'make', 'many', 'appearances', 'choir', 'magnificent.One', 'thing', 'noticed', 'amused', 'end', 'was', 'when', 'Charlotte', 'Church', 'was', 'singing', 'choir', 'stood', 'so', 'perfectly', 'was', 'were', 'enchanted', 'fact', 'anyone', 'singing', 'seemed', 'think', 'had', 'just', 'gone', 'heaven.A', 'spiritual', 'evening', 'one', 'imagines', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'wonderful', 'haveexperienced', 'Westminster', 'Abbey', 'person.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",Christmas Glory From Westminster with Andrea Bocelli and Charlotte Church VHS
