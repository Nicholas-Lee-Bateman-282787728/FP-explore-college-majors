I have been wanting to see it again since, and had been disappointed that it was not available through this site.  I have just discovered though that an Australian version is available via the Amazon UK site, or through ebay.  It is all region but it is PAL - you will need to play it either through a DVD player that can convert PAL to NTSC for American televisions, a dual-format NSTC/PAL television, or watch it on your computer.  I'm not sure if you can get around that through using an HDMI compatible player and HD television or a blu ray player.  In any case it is now available again in an edition by Umbrella Entertainment.There was also a companion book that I bought through Amazon many years ago.

But behind all The Man's  propaganda lies the truth, another chapter in the Afro-American's struggle  for emancipation, superbly summed up by the adopted slogan ""if you ain't  part of the solution, then you're part of the problem"".  Make no mistake,  the Panthers led by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale weren't formed as a Black  Supremist organisation but rather to look after the Black Community and to  exercise their Constitutionally protected human rights. Look, listen and  learn from this film - why the Panthers were formed, their prime reason for  existence, the Community Programmes they instigated and also the response  from the Authorities, both public and subversive. Although told from a  potentially biased viewpoint, the film does not shy away from recognising  the Ghetto had its own share of low-lifes and which the Panthers tried to  do something about. Such was their success in mobilising and inspiring the  Black community as never before it's no wonder the Authorities ran scared.  Their ultimate contingency plan however was not only morally abhorrent but  also backfired big time.  A superb dramatisation of the humble beginnings  of a local movement in Oakland, California illustrating just how it grew  into such a political tour-de-force. Like I said, look, listen and learn.

But I feel that it was an honest attempt to tell the story of the most controversial party in America: the Black Panthers.The story is based on the Panthers and how they came to be. The party gets frustrated with the police brutality in America and decide to defend themselves with weaponry.The acting is pretty good all around: Marcus Chong is great as Huey P Newton, Judge is Kadeem Hardison's best performance on screen point blank period. The same goes for Bokeem Woodbine's character in this movie. The only flaw is that they leave out a few key elements that lead to their downfall but other than that I have no real gripe with this film. I thought that Mario Van Peebles did the best he could with the material he was given but we have to understand that movies are edited just like books are edited so certain information that might have made a difference in the story. You can always read about the Black Panthers if you want to know more about them. This movie is worthy of being in your collection despite the little flaws. If you can find it at a reasonable price, you can definitely check it out.PS: to the sellers who are selling it for 164 and up are you high? Is the DVD made out of solid gold?

Mattocks,"[16, 21]","Malcolm X or Rosewood, but nonetheless, still effective in bring across the injustices suffered by african-americans in the 60's to early 70's.  I initially saw this film when I was very young and kind of slept on it.  However, after doing extensive research on The Panthers, their coming together, their downfall, and the devilish conspiracies of one J. Edgar Hoover, not only contributing to the Panthers downfall, but the killing of MLK, Malcolm X, and even indirect in the assassination of JFK, I found this movie to be enlightening and a constant reminder of where my people have come from, and how much further we still have to go even today.  The one part of the movie that is haunting for me and stands out so much is Hoover's direct or indirect involvement in drugs and heroin being brought into our inner cities to directly make our people commit geonocide on one another (though some may say this was ficticious, but we really know better).  Our Black leaders have cried this argument for the past 30 years and doesn't it seem rather ironic that the drug epedemic happened to boom just as the Panthers were being broken up, The Vietnam War ending, and racial tensions between blacks and law enforcement was at an all time high?  Coincidence, I think not.  The only thing is that those persons responsible for flying that stuff into our urban cities and ghetto's never counted on the fact that it would explode as a nationwide epedemic by the time the mid 80's rolled around and a drug called crack came into existence.  I think the movie should have gone a little deeper into the Panthers as a whole but knowing the Hollywood establishment, I'm sure the Van Peebles didn't have the luxurious studio budget afforded their white counterparts to make the movie they probably intended on making.
