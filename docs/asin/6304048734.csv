This was because of the ecstatic dancing they engaged in during their group activities. The Shakers were a religious movement that survived for decades, despite the fact that they were celibate. Men and women were housed in separate areas and with no children being born to replenish their numbers, it was necessary to recruit people into the movement if they were to survive over the long term.There is much to admire about the Shakers. They believed in strict equality for all people, they were one of the very few organizations that treated men and women equally. Blacks were also accepted as equals and theirs was a truly communal society. They produced very high quality merchandise, as they strove for perfection and simplicity in everything they did. They were pacifists, when the government tried to conscript Shaker men into the military during the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln was persuaded to grant them exemptions from the draft.Ken Burns uses archival photos, diary entries, interviews with some of the few surviving Shakers, statements of historians, readings of commentators of the time and film of their merchandise and structures that still exist to tell their story. The Shakers were quite inventive; it is stated that a Shaker woman invented the circular saw. They worked hard and valued all labor, believing that it was the will of God. Unfortunately for their movement, the Industrial Revolution allowed factories to make goods far cheaper than the Shakers could. Society also changed a great deal after the Civil War, the opportunities that existed outside their community were a strong attraction that many of the young Shakers could not resist. Finally, the strict vow of celibacy meant that their numbers could not be replenished from within. It became harder and harder to attract new people into the movement, and when people began leaving faster than they were recruited in, the decline began. This started a negative feedback loop, as the numbers dropped; fewer people wanted to join.Burns captures all of this in the film. As one of the historians' states, the Shakers were the first group to do many positive things. Social commentators as prominent as Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels are quoted as commenting favorably on the Shaker society. Even though the movement was a casualty of the changes in society, the Shakers did many very positive things and had a strong influence on the development of the country. Their influence went far beyond their numbers and Burns does an excellent job in capturing and explaining all that they accomplished.",5,Detailed explanation of a religious movement that did many good things but is largely misunderstood,1152144000,"07 6, 2006",2006,2730,"['true', 'name', 'was', 'United', 'Society', 'Believers', 'Christ', 'Second', 'Appearing', 'world', 'even', 'were', 'known', 'Shakers', 'was', 'ecstatic', 'dancing', 'engaged', 'group', 'activities', 'Shakers', 'were', 'religious', 'movement', 'survived', 'decades', 'fact', 'were', 'celibate', 'Men', 'women', 'were', 'housed', 'separate', 'areas', 'children', 'being', 'born', 'replenish', 'numbers', 'was', 'necessary', 'recruit', 'people', 'movement', 'were', 'survive', 'long', 'term.There', 'much', 'admire', 'Shakers', 'believed', 'strict', 'equality', 'people', 'were', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'organizations', 'treated', 'men', 'women', 'equally', 'Blacks', 'were', 'also', 'accepted', 'equals', 'was', 'truly', 'communal', 'society', 'produced', 'very', 'high', 'quality', 'merchandise', 'strove', 'perfection', 'simplicity', 'everything', 'did', 'were', 'pacifists', 'when', 'government', 'tried', 'conscript', 'Shaker', 'men', 'military', 'Civil', 'War', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'persuaded', 'grant', 'exemptions', 'draft.Ken', 'Burns', 'archival', 'photos', 'diary', 'entries', 'interviews', 'few', 'surviving', 'Shakers', 'statements', 'historians', 'readings', 'commentators', 'time', 'film', 'merchandise', 'structures', 'still', 'exist', 'tell', 'story', 'Shakers', 'were', 'quite', 'inventive', 'stated', 'Shaker', 'woman', 'invented', 'circular', 'saw', 'worked', 'hard', 'valued', 'labor', 'believing', 'was', 'will', 'God', 'Unfortunately', 'movement', 'Industrial', 'Revolution', 'allowed', 'factories', 'make', 'goods', 'far', 'cheaper', 'Shakers', 'could', 'Society', 'also', 'changed', 'great', 'deal', 'Civil', 'War', 'opportunities', 'existed', 'community', 'were', 'strong', 'attraction', 'many', 'young', 'Shakers', 'could', 'not', 'resist', 'Finally', 'strict', 'vow', 'celibacy', 'meant', 'numbers', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'replenished', 'became', 'harder', 'harder', 'attract', 'new', 'people', 'movement', 'when', 'people', 'began', 'leaving', 'faster', 'were', 'recruited', 'decline', 'began', 'started', 'negative', 'feedback', 'loop', 'numbers', 'dropped', 'fewer', 'people', 'wanted', 'join.Burns', 'captures', 'film', 'one', 'historians', 'states', 'Shakers', 'were', 'first', 'group', 'do', 'many', 'positive', 'things', 'Social', 'commentators', 'as', 'prominent', 'Karl', 'Marx', 'Friedrich', 'Engels', 'are', 'quoted', 'commenting', 'favorably', 'Shaker', 'society', 'Even', 'movement', 'was', 'casualty', 'changes', 'society', 'Shakers', 'did', 'many', 'very', 'positive', 'things', 'had', 'strong', 'influence', 'development', 'country', 'influence', 'went', 'far', 'numbers', 'Burns', 'excellent', 'job', 'capturing', 'explaining', 'accomplished']",Ken Burns' America - The Shakers VHS

But that is where I have to fault the film -- I don't think it goes deep enough.  Some of the most engaging images and topics are treated with only a cursory touch.  I wanted to hear and learn much more.Unlike Burns' later work, this film actually felt a bit rushed in places.As a primer on the Shakers, this film is virtually peerless, but I'm afraid it had me asking more questions than it answered.

By combining personal journals of shakers, historic and social commentary of scholars and contemporaries, and  wonderfully insightful interviews with present day Shakers, Burns tells a  simple story, but tells it beautifully.  By illustrating the Shaker life  and ideology, Burns presents a group of dedicated people who strove to put  God into every aspect of their lives.If you know the Shakers for only  their furniture and ritual dancing, then this film will illuminate your  understanding of early America's most powerful Utopian movement.",5,Beautiful and simple history of a misunderstood religion.,958867200,"05 21, 2000",2000,648,"['Shakers', 'Hands', 'Work', 'Hearts', 'God', 'quot', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'truly', 'hit', 'stride', 'documentarian', 'combining', 'personal', 'journals', 'shakers', 'historic', 'social', 'commentary', 'scholars', 'contemporaries', 'wonderfully', 'insightful', 'interviews', 'present', 'day', 'Shakers', 'Burns', 'simple', 'story', 'beautifully', 'illustrating', 'Shaker', 'life', 'ideology', 'Burns', 'group', 'dedicated', 'people', 'who', 'strove', 'put', 'God', 'aspect', 'lives.If', 'know', 'Shakers', 'only', 'furniture', 'ritual', 'dancing', 'then', 'film', 'will', 'illuminate', 'understanding', 'early', 'America', 'most', 'powerful', 'Utopian', 'movement']",Ken Burns' America - The Shakers VHS

As a historical work it ismisleading at best by perpetuating uninformed myths andstereotypes.  He does nothing to really explore the foundations ofShaker spirtuality, which gathered thousands to Shaker Villages fromMaine to Kentucky. He neglects to give the viewer a true insight toMother Ann and the Church that she brought to America. But ratherfocuses on the temporal by products of their faith (furniture,architecture, and the like).  Worst of all Mr. Burns leaves theviewer with the incorrect notion that the Shakers are about tovanish. A total misrepresentation of the facts. The community atSabbathday Lake contuines to grow and is excited about thefuture. Even at the time this video was made several new coverts hadrecently joined the community at Sabbathday Lake. It seems odd thatMr. Burns would leave such an important detail out of hisdocumentary. Or maybe editorial is a better word.  The BBC did videoon the Shakers in 1990, 4 years after the Burns video.

398288,A2ZHH7AK83JB5G,6304048734,"Susan K. Schoonover ""Sue Yingling""","[4, 4]","Ken Burns' film about the religious sect ""The Shakers"" is typical of the superior work he has done in making historical documentaries for PBS.  The film is less than an hour in length so of course it is a fairly superficial look at this fascinating group and their contributions to American history. However Burns does delve at least somewhat in to the history and religious beliefs of this group that was originally called the Shaking Quakers and was founded in  18th century England by an illiterate woman known as Mother Ann.  The church grew to have nineteen thriving ""societies"" in the United States that aside from their beautiful simple furniture developed high quality seeds, cattle breeds, brooms, architecture and many other perfectly designed products. As in most Burns documentaries  quotes from journal entries and contemporary writers and observers are read by actors and authentic pictures and photographs are used throughout to illustrate the story.  The most memorable part of the film for me was the interviews with two elderly women who were long time Shakers and who radiated peace and contentment as they told of their long lives in the community.",4,"""Tis A Gift To Be Simple""",1209340800,"04 28, 2008",2008,1168,"['Ken', 'Burns', 'film', 'religious', 'sect', 'Shakers', 'typical', 'superior', 'work', 'done', 'making', 'historical', 'documentaries', 'PBS', 'film', 'less', 'hour', 'length', 'so', 'course', 'fairly', 'superficial', 'look', 'fascinating', 'group', 'contributions', 'American', 'history', 'However', 'Burns', 'delve', 'least', 'somewhat', 'history', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'group', 'was', 'originally', 'called', 'Shaking', 'Quakers', 'was', 'founded', '18th', 'century', 'England', 'illiterate', 'woman', 'known', 'Mother', 'Ann', 'church', 'grew', 'have', 'nineteen', 'thriving', 'societies', 'United', 'States', 'aside', 'beautiful', 'simple', 'furniture', 'developed', 'high', 'quality', 'seeds', 'cattle', 'breeds', 'brooms', 'architecture', 'many', 'other', 'perfectly', 'designed', 'products', 'most', 'Burns', 'documentaries', 'journal', 'entries', 'contemporary', 'writers', 'observers', 'are', 'read', 'actors', 'authentic', 'pictures', 'photographs', 'are', 'used', 'illustrate', 'story', 'most', 'memorable', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'interviews', 'two', 'elderly', 'women', 'who', 'were', 'long', 'time', 'Shakers', 'who', 'radiated', 'peace', 'contentment', 'told', 'long', 'lives', 'community']",Ken Burns' America - The Shakers VHS
