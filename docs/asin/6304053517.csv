The one who was going let her in is called by a highly intelligent named Max but he is shot with a tranquilizer and subdued. The reporter breaks into the place and releases the million dollar dog. She is mugged and the dog kills the mugger. I thought he was subdued? Anyways, if your a pet lover then this movie is not for you. The only real graphic scene involved the dog swallowing a cat whole and it implies he rapes the dog next door. The dog's face is even burned towards the end. The movie looks like a typical 90's horror movie with bad acting and not alot of gore. The story makes little sense including the fact the the dog was shot with a tranquilizer and he will turn into a killing machine when it wears off even though he's killed 3 people already.

398419,A2198FZZMTJ38H,6304053517,D. Litton,"[6, 8]","&quot;Man's Best Friend&quot; tells the somewhat intense story of a reporter who finds out that the dog she stole is more than just a good guardian, but an unstable killer. Let's face it: this might as well have been titled &quot;Beethoven 3: Revenge.&quot; The story has some good elements going for it: it certainly has a lot to say about what happens when humans tamper with nature. But those few good things are buried in a heap of unbelievable events and details, and so the movie flops.The story begins with nosy reporter Lori Tanner, played by Ally Sheedy, sneaking into a top security experiment laboratory to uncover allegations against the company for cruelty to animals. This is the first in a string of unbelievable sequences: if the facility is as important and top secret as the movie portrays it, where are all the guards? Nonetheless, she breaks in and gets the scoop, not to mention a large dog named Max who seems friendly until the project leader, Dr. Jarret, shows up to scare Lori away.Max escapes and hitches a ride home with her, and once there, he takes a liking to her and a strong disdain for her boyfriend, Perry, who wants him out of the house, Meanwhile, Dr. Jarret reports the dog theft to the police, leading to the inevitable foreshadowing of doom as he tells the detectives about Max's genetic altering that will lead him to unspeakable acts of violence. And wouldn't you know it? He starts going nuts: completely digesting a whole cat, murdering a mailman and burying him like he was a chicken bone.The movie has fun with the normal dog cliches: the mailman and cat are one of them, as well as his instinct to protect Lori from Perry. As I've seen in reality, some dogs have a real problem with their owner's significant other, and the movie takes this and makes it funny in some places, while terrifying in others. Perry is a wimp to begin with, so that makes it even funnier.The story itself is not all that bad, either. It has all the normal clich&eacute;s you would expect to find in a routine thriller: the pair of detectives who can't seem to get a grasp on the situation, which leads to a hilarious send-up of cop-criminal chases in which they chase the dog by automobile. The unsuspecting damsel who thinks she's doing something good, but ends up being the real bad guy. Sheedy does well in the role of Lori, playing her as naive and relentless in her pursuit of the facts. Then there's the know-it-all scientist, Dr. Jarret, who supplies the story by foreshadowing gruesome events. Lance Henriksen plays the part well: forcing us to believe in his words by making them sound serious.Still, there is a downside, and this has to do mainly with the dog's abilities because of his genetic altering. The movie allows him to become camouflage in order to deceive his pursuant. Unless Webster rolled over in his grave, the world &quot;camouflage&quot; means to keep the same form while disguising yourself to look like something else, like a lizard changing color to match a leaf. Here, Max is able to take on the form of a heap of sports equipment, not just the color. A bit unbelievable, if you ask me, and so is his ability to urinate acid. And what about those claws, which enable him to climb to the top of trees?You can enjoy &quot;Man's Best Friend&quot; if you don't take it too seriously. The story doesn't attempt to be too convincing, so really, all we're left with is to sit back and enjoy the ride, which does have some good thrills along the way.",3,Clich&eacute;d but fun.,990316800,"05 20, 2001",2001,3496,"['quot', 'Man', 'Best', 'Friend', 'quot', 'somewhat', 'intense', 'story', 'reporter', 'who', 'out', 'dog', 'stole', 'more', 'just', 'good', 'guardian', 'unstable', 'killer', 'Let', 'face', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'titled', 'quot', '3', 'Revenge.', 'quot', 'story', 'good', 'elements', 'going', 'certainly', 'lot', 'say', 'what', 'when', 'humans', 'tamper', 'nature', 'few', 'good', 'things', 'are', 'buried', 'heap', 'unbelievable', 'events', 'details', 'so', 'movie', 'flops.The', 'story', 'nosy', 'reporter', 'Lori', 'Tanner', 'played', 'Ally', 'Sheedy', 'sneaking', 'top', 'security', 'experiment', 'laboratory', 'uncover', 'allegations', 'company', 'cruelty', 'animals', 'first', 'string', 'unbelievable', 'sequences', 'facility', 'important', 'top', 'secret', 'movie', 'where', 'are', 'guards', 'Nonetheless', 'scoop', 'not', 'mention', 'large', 'dog', 'named', 'Max', 'who', 'friendly', 'project', 'leader', 'Dr.', 'Jarret', 'up', 'scare', 'Lori', 'away.Max', 'escapes', 'ride', 'home', 'once', 'there', 'liking', 'strong', 'disdain', 'boyfriend', 'Perry', 'who', 'house', 'Meanwhile', 'Dr.', 'Jarret', 'dog', 'theft', 'police', 'leading', 'inevitable', 'foreshadowing', 'doom', 'detectives', 'Max', 'genetic', 'altering', 'will', 'lead', 'unspeakable', 'acts', 'violence', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'going', 'nuts', 'completely', 'digesting', 'whole', 'cat', 'murdering', 'mailman', 'burying', 'was', 'chicken', 'bone.The', 'movie', 'fun', 'normal', 'dog', 'cliches', 'mailman', 'cat', 'are', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'instinct', 'protect', 'Lori', 'Perry', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'reality', 'dogs', 'have', 'real', 'problem', 'owner', 'significant', 'other', 'movie', 'funny', 'places', 'terrifying', 'others', 'Perry', 'wimp', 'begin', 'even', 'funnier.The', 'story', 'not', 'bad', 'either', 'normal', 'clich', 'eacute', 'would', 'expect', 'find', 'routine', 'thriller', 'pair', 'detectives', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'grasp', 'situation', 'hilarious', 'send-up', 'cop-criminal', 'chases', 'chase', 'dog', 'automobile', 'unsuspecting', 'damsel', 'who', 'doing', 'something', 'good', 'up', 'being', 'real', 'bad', 'guy', 'Sheedy', 'well', 'role', 'Lori', 'playing', 'naive', 'relentless', 'pursuit', 'facts', 'Then', 'know-it-all', 'scientist', 'Dr.', 'Jarret', 'who', 'story', 'foreshadowing', 'gruesome', 'events', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'part', 'well', 'forcing', 'believe', 'words', 'making', 'sound', 'serious.Still', 'downside', 'do', 'mainly', 'dog', 'abilities', 'genetic', 'altering', 'movie', 'become', 'camouflage', 'order', 'deceive', 'pursuant', 'Webster', 'rolled', 'over', 'grave', 'world', 'quot', 'camouflage', 'quot', 'keep', 'same', 'form', 'disguising', 'look', 'something', 'else', 'lizard', 'changing', 'color', 'match', 'leaf', 'Here', 'Max', 'able', 'take', 'form', 'heap', 'sports', 'equipment', 'not', 'just', 'color', 'bit', 'unbelievable', 'ask', 'so', 'ability', 'urinate', 'acid', 'what', 'claws', 'enable', 'climb', 'top', 'trees', 'can', 'enjoy', 'quot', 'Man', 'Best', 'Friend', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'story', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'be', 'too', 'convincing', 'so', 'really', ""'re"", 'left', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'have', 'good', 'thrills', 'way']",Man's Best Friend VHS

398427,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,6304053517,Paperbackstash,"[1, 1]","Man's Best friend has an interesting premise but was served up lukewarm. Lance Henriksen (always brilliant to see) plays a deceptive, cold scientist who has been doing animal research and experimentation with various cells and placing them in an ordinary dog. Those damned scientists are at it again I tell you! These genetically tweaked DNA samples come from everything such as predatory cats and chameleons. ""Max"" is rescued by an animal activist reporter who protests against research. Of course she promptly takes the dog home, and the two get along wonderfully until...well, let's just say until Max's side effects come to light.For one thing, while Max adores his new friend, he doesn't' dig her main squeezer. Add to this the neighborhood cats, psychotic mailmen from hell - THEY need to be put on a leash! - and bicycling, annoying kids, and you have a recipe for disaster. Apparently if Max doesn't receive his meds he gets cranky. Watch out!The plot sounds great, doesn't it? Well, look too hard and that falls apart. Sadly, the movie is predictable and the ending depressed the hell out of me. I can dig why the lead role, Lori, despises animal research - this movie seems like it was trying to make a bizarre point and instead gets muddled somewhere. It makes zero sense the dog will know only to kill 'bad guys', even when they're not obviously bad - like the boyfriend. And acid urine? Too unbelievable to be bought. Also, I could have done without the obvious cute attempts.On the good side, we do get Lance Henricksen, who acts his best here. His role as the kooky pissed off scientist convinced me. Ally Sheedy was semi-believable as the reporter; not an award winner but fair enough.The pacing isn't too steady; in the beginning things are a bit slow and later they rush in the final scenes. Direction is alright but nothing to get too excited over. Everything's sunny and shiny and at times shaky cam is used.Shopping for some killer dog horror? Cujo's darker and more serious than this. While not a horrible movie, it's just not that good either. It tries too hard to be cute in some places and fails, the pacing isn't even, there's nothing extraordinary in directing, the music falters, and the acting is only average.

While she is there she kidnaps ""MAX"" a Tibetan Mastiff who is apparently the culmination of the scientist's work (Scientist played by Lance Hendrickson).  MAX instantly worms his way into her heart with his human intelligence and precious furry face.  Unfortunately MAX is also very possessive, and overly protective of his new human love interest, much to the chagrin of her boyfriend.Honestly this movie is not good, it's straight B-Movie fair, but man is it fun on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  The things this dog can do are so way over the top you would think the movie was written by a 12 year old.  But, the humor in the way they are executed will amuse most B-Movie fans.  The cat and mailman scenes are hysterical to me.  And you couldn't have picked a cuter more lovable dog (who is by the way, the best actor in the film).  If you are looking for art, look elsewhere.

398429,A3UA046AA3DXFD,6304053517,Sid the Elf,"[2, 3]","A nice Thursday evening spent with the third member of Sid army inspired yet another 90's B horror review from the North pole's ultimate B enthusiast. It's been a few non-review weeks due to a surplus in orders thanks to this whole Christmas in July non-sense. Obviously we all know Christmas only comes once a year baby! Yet we've been hard at work filling Santa's orders, but have found a little down time again now that July's coming to a close. What better way to celebrate then with a 90's B horror starring Ally Sheedy and Lance Hendrickson? It's an extremely odd pairing but comes together nicely like red hots and knock off M&M;'s from sizzler eaten out of your sweat short pockets. The film is truly the type of B we look for in every sense. In so many ways it was so awful which is what makes it so perfect. We all know the old adage ""it's so bad it's good."" This is a motto we've centered our lives around.Man's best friend starts out with news reported Ally Sheedy who sneaks into a animal testing lab to expose the cruel experiments. During her search she comes across a giant, very friendly pooch named Max. As she's telling Max ""c'mon baby you know your the girl of my dreams"" Lance Hendrickson burst in full of rage like he's hunting down Pumpkinhead. Since Andrew Clark wasn't there to wrestle Lance so freaking bad, they had no choice but to high tail it out of their with the dog close by. What Ally doesn't know is this dog's a scientific freakshow compiled with genes from every animal on the planet. He can run as fast as a cheetah, blend into things like a chameleon, has the strength of a bear, and can climb trees like a ring tail lemur. This is a dog you don't want to F with. Obviously the dog goes mental and eats a cat, kills a mail man then burries him under the deck, clips Ally's boyfriends breaks...then later kills him, and kills the scientist. However you really pull for the dog the whole time, poor bast**d never saw it coming.So to sum it up, Man's Best friend is some top choice grade A meat in the 90's B horror field. Sure it was laughable and never even close to scary but that's what a true good B consists of. The film had so many parts that made you feel as if you were watching a kids movie, especially when they played a B cover of puppy love while Max tried to score with the neighbors dog. It would then switch gears from playful to straight up insane in the blink of an eye. Completely all over the place in the best way possible. For the movie snobs this film will simply not be in your comfort zone. It's not scary and not enjoyable unless you can kick back and enjoys it's Bness. But honestly, if you're expecting to be scared by this movie you've already got a nice stocking full of issues.",4,I got bit in the a** by a dog today son,1311292800,"07 22, 2011",2011,2744,"['nice', 'Thursday', 'evening', 'spent', 'third', 'member', 'Sid', 'army', 'inspired', 'yet', '90', 'B', 'horror', 'review', 'North', 'pole', 'ultimate', 'B', 'enthusiast', 'been', 'few', 'non-review', 'weeks', 'due', 'surplus', 'orders', 'thanks', 'whole', 'Christmas', 'July', 'non-sense', 'know', 'Christmas', 'only', 'once', 'year', 'baby', ""'ve"", 'been', 'hard', 'work', 'filling', 'Santa', 'orders', 'have', 'found', 'little', 'down', 'time', 'again', 'now', 'July', 'coming', 'close', 'What', 'better', 'way', 'celebrate', 'then', '90', 'B', 'horror', 'starring', 'Ally', 'Sheedy', 'Lance', 'Hendrickson', 'extremely', 'odd', 'pairing', 'together', 'nicely', 'red', 'hots', 'knock', 'off', 'M', 'M', 'sizzler', 'eaten', 'sweat', 'short', 'pockets', 'film', 'truly', 'type', 'B', 'look', 'sense', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'was', 'so', 'awful', 'what', 'so', 'perfect', 'know', 'old', 'adage', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'motto', ""'ve"", 'centered', 'lives', 'around.Man', 'best', 'friend', 'out', 'news', 'reported', 'Ally', 'Sheedy', 'who', 'sneaks', 'animal', 'testing', 'lab', 'expose', 'cruel', 'experiments', 'search', 'giant', 'very', 'friendly', 'pooch', 'named', 'Max', 'telling', 'Max', ""c'mon"", 'baby', 'know', 'girl', 'dreams', 'Lance', 'Hendrickson', 'burst', 'full', 'rage', 'hunting', 'down', 'Pumpkinhead', 'Andrew', 'Clark', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'wrestle', 'Lance', 'freaking', 'bad', 'had', 'choice', 'high', 'tail', 'dog', 'close', 'What', 'Ally', ""n't"", 'know', 'dog', 'scientific', 'freakshow', 'compiled', 'genes', 'animal', 'planet', 'can', 'run', 'as', 'fast', 'cheetah', 'blend', 'things', 'chameleon', 'strength', 'bear', 'can', 'climb', 'trees', 'ring', 'tail', 'lemur', 'dog', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'F', 'Obviously', 'dog', 'mental', 'cat', 'mail', 'man', 'then', 'deck', 'Ally', 'boyfriends', 'breaks', 'then', 'later', 'scientist', 'However', 'really', 'pull', 'dog', 'whole', 'time', 'poor', 'bast**d', 'never', 'saw', 'sum', 'up', 'Man', 'Best', 'friend', 'top', 'choice', 'grade', 'meat', '90', 'B', 'horror', 'field', 'Sure', 'was', 'laughable', 'never', 'even', 'close', 'scary', 'what', 'true', 'good', 'B', 'consists', 'film', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'parts', 'made', 'feel', 'were', 'watching', 'kids', 'movie', 'especially', 'when', 'played', 'B', 'cover', 'puppy', 'love', 'Max', 'tried', 'score', 'neighbors', 'dog', 'would', 'then', 'switch', 'gears', 'playful', 'straight', 'up', 'insane', 'blink', 'eye', 'Completely', 'place', 'best', 'way', 'possible', 'movie', 'snobs', 'film', 'will', 'simply', 'not', 'be', 'comfort', 'zone', 'not', 'scary', 'not', 'enjoyable', 'can', 'kick', 'back', 'Bness', 'honestly', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'be', 'scared', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'already', 'got', 'nice', 'stocking', 'full', 'issues']",Man's Best Friend VHS
