218250,A2IVCG4IILTY6O,6300215733,"abt1950 ""abt1950""","[29, 36]","&quot;Donovan's Reef&quot; is a strange hybrid of a movie.  On the one hand, it's a vehicle for John Wayne to show off with the rest of the very talented cast.  On the other, it's also a morality play about racism, set on a lush, (and distant) South Pacific island, but very relevant to the United States of the early 1960s.  In these days of multiracial awareness, the latter aspect seems a bit dated, and talk about &quot;half caste [non-white] children&quot; is quaint.  Cliches and cultural stereotypes abound, but in its time ""Donovan's Reef""  was a progressive and even (as another reviewer has called it)  &quot;subversive&quot; movie.  The beautiful exotic setting no doubt made the message of racial equality more palatable to the mainstream American audience of the day.Today, however, the movie endures primarily because of the strength of the cast and the characters they create.  A young Lee Marvin plays the brawling Gilhooley and Cesar Romero  the pleasantly oily French governor.  The Asian actor who plays the governor's aide is truly splendid.  His name should be up in  the main credits along with the stars.  Although there is not a weak performance among the lot, my favorite moments are the exchanges between Wayne and Elizabeth Allen, his foil and romantic interest.  She plays the supposedly straitlaced  Bostonian and he the salty ex-pat bar owner.  Both are strong characters, and they give each other as good as they get.On the negative side, the narrative is sometimes disjointed, as if the movie tries to be too much in too little time.  It's as if too much film ended up on the cutting room floor.  A pity, because if what was edited out is of the same caliber as what was left in, some rare moments have been lost.  Too bad John Ford isn't around to do a &quot;director's cut.&quot;""Donovan's Reef"" may not be a great movie, but it sure is fun to watch.",4,Watch this one for the performances!,1060905600,"08 15, 2003",2003,1884,"['quot', 'Donovan', 'Reef', 'quot', 'strange', 'hybrid', 'movie', 'one', 'hand', 'vehicle', 'John', 'Wayne', 'show', 'off', 'rest', 'very', 'talented', 'cast', 'other', 'also', 'morality', 'play', 'racism', 'set', 'lush', 'distant', 'South', 'Pacific', 'island', 'very', 'relevant', 'United', 'States', 'early', '1960s', 'days', 'multiracial', 'awareness', 'latter', 'aspect', 'bit', 'dated', 'talk', 'quot', 'half', 'caste', '[', 'non-white', ']', 'children', 'quot', 'quaint', 'Cliches', 'cultural', 'stereotypes', 'abound', 'time', 'Donovan', 'Reef', 'was', 'progressive', 'even', 'reviewer', 'called', 'quot', 'subversive', 'quot', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'exotic', 'setting', 'doubt', 'made', 'message', 'racial', 'equality', 'more', 'palatable', 'mainstream', 'American', 'audience', 'day.Today', 'however', 'movie', 'primarily', 'strength', 'cast', 'characters', 'create', 'young', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'brawling', 'Gilhooley', 'Cesar', 'Romero', 'pleasantly', 'oily', 'French', 'governor', 'Asian', 'actor', 'who', 'governor', 'aide', 'truly', 'splendid', 'name', 'should', 'be', 'up', 'main', 'credits', 'stars', 'not', 'weak', 'performance', 'lot', 'favorite', 'moments', 'are', 'exchanges', 'Wayne', 'Elizabeth', 'Allen', 'foil', 'romantic', 'interest', 'supposedly', 'straitlaced', 'Bostonian', 'salty', 'ex-pat', 'bar', 'owner', 'are', 'strong', 'characters', 'give', 'other', 'as', 'good', 'get.On', 'negative', 'side', 'narrative', 'sometimes', 'disjointed', 'movie', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'little', 'time', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'ended', 'up', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'pity', 'what', 'was', 'edited', 'out', 'same', 'caliber', 'what', 'was', 'left', 'rare', 'moments', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'Too', 'bad', 'John', 'Ford', ""n't"", 'around', 'do', 'quot', 'director', 'cut.', 'quot', 'Donovan', 'Reef', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'great', 'movie', 'sure', 'fun', 'watch']",N/A

Thus you have Lee Marvin instead of Victor McLaglen, Jack Warden in a 'Ward Bond' role, and Elizabeth Allen in a part 'tailor-made' for a younger Maureen O'Hara. Even Wayne, himself, at 56, seems a bit 'long-in-the-tooth' for the physical demands of his role (challenging the 32-year-old Allen in a swimming race?), as well as the romance (a fact that even the Duke would agree with; this would mark the last time he would play a romantic lead, 'winning' an actress so much younger). Also, knowing that in less than two years Wayne would lose a lung to cancer, one winces at the number of cigarettes he lights up, throughout the film.

Also dwelling there is Boston-bred Dr. William Dedham (Warden), who stayed on after receiving word of his wife's death, married the granddaughter of the last hereditary prince of the island group, and had two daughters and a son by her before her death some five years ago.  Complications begin when their old shipmate, Aloysious ""Boats"" Gilhooley (Marvin in one of his most delightful roles), dives off a passing ship and swims to shore to celebrate his and Donovan's shared birthday with their customary annual brawl, and continues when Dedham's daughter by his first wife, whom he has never seen, arrives with the intention of getting the doctor to sign over his shares in the family's shipping empire.  Despite the bewildered protests of Leilani, the eldest member of Doc's second family, Donovan takes the children into his own apartment above the saloon and pretends they're his, fearing how the strait-laced Miss Amelia Dedham will react when she discovers she has ""half-caste"" siblings.  Meanwhile the islanders are preparing for their regular observance of Christmas, complete with a visit by an Australian Navy corvette (with whose crew Donovan and Gilhooley have a second brawl) and a re-enactment of the Nativity (in which Gilhooley solemnly appears as ""the King of America,"" complete with jauntily angled gold-paper crown).  Despite the difference in their ages, Donovan and Amelia, with suitable stumbles, misunderstandings, and outright clashes (reminiscent of those between Wayne and Maureen O'Hara inMcLintock! (Authentic Collector's Edition)and of the classic story line of Shakespeare'sThe Taming of the Shrew (The Pelican Shakespeare)), become attracted to each other and even overcome the slyly good-humored efforts of the island's French governor, the Marquis Andre LaLage (Cesar Romero), to sabotage the relationship so he can pay court to Amelia and use her millions to get out of what he views as ""exile"" (one especially delightful sequence occurs as he is dictating a letter to his cousin, a high official in the Colonial Service, to get him transferred).  Dorothy Lamour plays the half-caste singer Fleur, whose pursuit of Gilhooley furnishes the secondary romantic interest; Mike Mazurki is wonderful as Monk, local Sergeant in the Foreign Legion; Edgar Buchanan has a small but telling role as the shrewd and plain-spoken attorney whose advice leads to Amelia's undertaking the voyage; Jon Fong is Mr. Yu, the Marquis's snappily-dressed secretary (Amherst, Class of '53); and Marcel Dalio plays Father Cleuzot, who ministers to the spiritual needs of the island-dwellers.

218286,AN7XYZFIJBG52,6300215733,Critic-at-Arms,"[3, 3]","This movie seems dated, over 4 decades later -- but only because of its own influence on society.While ""South Pacific"" was a morality play surrounded by adventure and scenery, ""Donovan's Reef"" was adventure and scenery with a morality play buried inside.  Today, even the phrase ""half-caste"" is archaic (younger readers: this means someone with parents from different races, in this case a Caucasian father and a Polynesian mother), but this was about the politest way to describe such a person in the early 1960s.  Remember, this was a time in American history when some parts of the country considered non-whites to be so different that there were laws to keep them separate.By embedding the lesson in the midst of a beautiful environment, and by showing literally dozens of beautiful and graceful Polynesian and Filipino women, ""Donovan's Reef"" gave generations of white American men something interesting to look at, and white American women reason to be jealous.John Ford's direction made it impossible to see these women as anything but admirable -- and of the four American women in the film, one is pleasantly and completely senile, two are cold statues, and the other is calculating, mercenary and scheming, until she slams head-on into a society which sees little value in the things which Boston society considers the pinnacle of success.Contrast the meetins of the two shipping companies -- the one in Boston is in a paneled boardroom, with a huge table people as icy as the snowstorm outside, while the one in Polynesia is over a desk in a corner of a barroom.""Donovan's Reef"" again shows the versatility of John Wayne as a character.  Sure, he's the Duke wherever you put him, but that character FITS everywhere also.  Cowboy, pilot, detective, it doesn't matter.  The Duke is defender of the weak (in this case, his friend and the friend's children), and that's always a good role to play.While their names were in the ""also"" list, the three child actors do well with their roles, and let's face it, the kids ARE the story, from the early maturity of the princess who calmly tells the Boston socialite ""I respect the beliefs of my people"" to the boy who braves the storm to get his baseball hat.Interestingly, the other child, Cherylene Lee, has gone beyond decades of acting to become a playwright, largely focussing on race issues!Yes, the film is dated, but that's because of the influence that it had, many years ago and on the generations since.By filming in Hawaii, Ford and Wayne were able to work with some of the most spectacular scenery in the world, so the film is worth watching just for that.All in all, this is one of the finest unsung films of all time, and a lot of fun to watch.",5,"Dated, thanks to itself",1138320000,"01 27, 2006",2006,2710,"['movie', 'dated', '4', 'decades', 'later', 'only', 'own', 'influence', 'society.While', 'South', 'Pacific', 'was', 'morality', 'play', 'surrounded', 'adventure', 'scenery', 'Donovan', 'Reef', 'was', 'adventure', 'scenery', 'morality', 'play', 'buried', 'Today', 'even', 'phrase', 'half-caste', 'archaic', 'younger', 'readers', 'someone', 'parents', 'different', 'races', 'case', 'Caucasian', 'father', 'Polynesian', 'mother', 'was', 'politest', 'way', 'describe', 'person', 'early', '1960s', 'Remember', 'was', 'time', 'American', 'history', 'when', 'parts', 'country', 'considered', 'non-whites', 'be', 'so', 'different', 'were', 'laws', 'keep', 'separate.By', 'embedding', 'lesson', 'midst', 'beautiful', 'environment', 'showing', 'literally', 'dozens', 'beautiful', 'graceful', 'Polynesian', 'Filipino', 'women', 'Donovan', 'Reef', 'gave', 'generations', 'white', 'American', 'men', 'something', 'interesting', 'look', 'white', 'American', 'women', 'reason', 'be', 'jealous.John', 'Ford', 'direction', 'made', 'impossible', 'see', 'women', 'anything', 'admirable', 'four', 'American', 'women', 'film', 'one', 'pleasantly', 'completely', 'senile', 'two', 'are', 'cold', 'statues', 'other', 'calculating', 'mercenary', 'scheming', 'head-on', 'society', 'little', 'value', 'things', 'Boston', 'society', 'pinnacle', 'success.Contrast', 'meetins', 'two', 'shipping', 'companies', 'one', 'Boston', 'paneled', 'boardroom', 'huge', 'table', 'people', 'as', 'icy', 'snowstorm', 'one', 'Polynesia', 'desk', 'corner', 'barroom', 'Donovan', 'Reef', 'again', 'versatility', 'John', 'Wayne', 'character', 'Sure', 'Duke', 'wherever', 'put', 'character', 'FITS', 'everywhere', 'also', 'Cowboy', 'pilot', 'detective', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Duke', 'defender', 'weak', 'case', 'friend', 'friend', 'children', 'always', 'good', 'role', 'play.While', 'names', 'were', 'also', 'list', 'three', 'child', 'actors', 'do', 'well', 'roles', 'let', 'face', 'kids', 'ARE', 'story', 'early', 'maturity', 'princess', 'who', 'Boston', 'socialite', 'respect', 'beliefs', 'people', 'boy', 'who', 'storm', 'get', 'baseball', 'hat.Interestingly', 'other', 'child', 'Cherylene', 'Lee', 'gone', 'decades', 'acting', 'become', 'playwright', 'largely', 'focussing', 'race', 'issues', 'Yes', 'film', 'dated', 'influence', 'had', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'generations', 'since.By', 'filming', 'Hawaii', 'Ford', 'Wayne', 'were', 'able', 'work', 'most', 'spectacular', 'scenery', 'world', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'that.All', 'one', 'finest', 'unsung', 'films', 'time', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch']",N/A

I can't agree more.  There were several times when it was clear that important scenes were omitted... by the dialogue which followed.  If those scenes could ever be returned to the movie, it would flow much better.Also, it's apparent that some scenes were shot at quite different times of the day.

Taylor ""GFT""","[0, 0]","Although he worked in many genres, director John Ford was most particularly associated with the Western--and often as not his star of choice was John Wayne.  Together, they made a host of memorable films, including STAGECOACH, SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON, THE SEARCHERS, and THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE.  Released in 1963, DONOVAN'S REEF would be their final pairing, and instead of a wild west shoot-out they go out with a tropical belly laugh.Set in French Polynesia, DONOVAN'S REEF is the story of three men who vexed the Japanese during World War: Donovan (Wayne), Gilhooley (Lee Marvin), and Dr. Dedham (Jack Warden.)  With the war long past, Donovan and Dedham have settled on the island they once defended, Donovan running a saloon, Dedham operating a hospital--and they receive brawling visits from Gilhooley, who drops in at least once a year to raise hell.  It is paradise, complete with lucious and flower-laden women who seem to exist only to entertain the three stars.But it happens that Dr. Dedham has a Boston-born daughter, and when a death in the family threatens the status quo she arrives on the island determined to undermine her long-unseen father's position.  It also happens that, unbeknownst to her, the doctor later married a native woman (now deceased) and had three children by her.  With the doctor visiting another island, Donovan is fearful of how the Boston daughter will react--and so he passes the children off as his own.  The result is a series of mix-ups, romantic entanglements, and general foolishness that is a tremendous amount of fun.Over the years DONOVAN'S REEF has sometimes been described as racist, for the plot hinges on the Boston daughter's likely reaction to her mixed-race step-sisters and brothers, and the children are specifically described as ""not white"" and ""half-caste.""  But to think of the film in this way does it a great disservice; if anything, the film takes an anti-racist stance, for it presents the doctor, his deceased second wife, and their children in an extremely positive light--and when all is said and done the anticipated racism that motivates the plot goes out the window.What makes the thing work is the cast, which is a lot of fun to watch.  In addition to the stars, there are memorable comic turns by Dorothy Lamour as an aging but oblivious South Seas floozie; charming Elizabeth Allen as the Boston daughter who comes to her senses; Ceaser Romero as an amusing romantic complication; and the ever-memorable Marcel Dalio, one cinema's finest character actors, as Father Cluezot.  It might be more than a little sexist, and it might not be as forthright about racism as a modern audience would expect, but it's just a lot fun.The DVD transfer is not remastered, but it is a remarkably good print and the film is offered in the original widescreen format.  There are no extras beyond the theatrical trailer, but--so what?  The movie is charming enough to stand on its own!

Donovan's Reef is beautifully filmed in color & Ford gives loving detail much as he did with The Quiet Man. I sense that this movie was made on a ""working"" vacation, they make the movie on location in Hawaii & get paid to do it. How much better can it get? Donovan's Reef is shown in a widescreen format though the aspect ratio isn't extreme. The cast is good & it's not Ford's usual stock company of actors. It has Lee Marvin, Elizabeth Allen, Jack Warden, Cesar Romero, Dick Foran & Dorothy Lamour. Patrick Wayne has a small role as an Australian sailor.Donovan's Reef is the saloon that's owned by ""Guns"" Donovan (John Wayne) who had first come to the island during WWII when the destroyer he was on was sunk. Two of his friends, Gilhooley (Lee Marvin) & Dr. William Dedham (Jack Warden), were survivors also. After the war they returned to the island to live. Donovan & Dedham had been living there for years while Gilhooley shows up for the annual birthday bash between himself & Donovan; they share the same day. The premise of the story that introduces Amelia Dedham (Elizabeth Allen) to the island is that she's there to meet her father, main shareholder in the family shipping business, & to get him to sign over the shares to her. Dr. Dedham had remarried, he had become a widower but hadn't seen his first wife in years, & had three children by his now deceased Polynesian wife who was the last surviving member of the island's royalty. The friends of Dr. Dedham decide to move the children to Donovan's home because they're not sure how Amelia will react to them. Of course, Donovan & Amelia don't like each other at first then they fall in love. This romance is a little hard to believe because of the age difference, Donovan is old enough to be her father. All turns out well in the end. This movie doesn't break any new ground though it does have some funny moments. You can look at it as a more comedic version of The Quiet Man.

This film is proof of their talents. It is not something to be taken seriously but it is at once fun, sweet, dated and a precious Hollywood relic.John Wayne stars as Michael Donovan, a saloon keeper and shipping owner on a South Seas paradise island. Lee Marvin plays Gilhooley, a brawling friend who shows up every birthday for a ritual fight. Jack Warden rounds out the trio as the Doc. What all of them have in common is that they were shipwrecked on the island durnign WWII while it was under Japanese occupation and led a resistance movement but all of that is in the past. Now the war is over and each has carried on with life. In the case of the Doc, he married the hereditary princess of the island and had three wonderful kids. The problem is that he has a daughter from a prior marriage back in Boston who is scheming to be heiress of a major shipping line there and who comes out to the island to get evidence against her father she can use to show he is unfit. She arrives while the doc is making house calls to other islands and John Wayne steps in to protect the doc by claiming the kids as his own. Naturally, the Duke and the heiress fuss and feud but we all know that she is destined to be his lady.Much of this film is silly but that does not stop it from being fun. The film tries to be racially diverse in a style that would never go over today but was quite a step forward in the 50s. There is little or know physical danger beyond that which is alluded to from the war. The barroom brawls are handled as entertainment for all concerned. As I said, it is silly but it works.John Wayne plays himself as he does in all of his films. Lee Marvin plays a buffoon who manages to be fun even when he is being insulting. Jack Warden does little himself but what he does do, he does well and believably. Caesar Romero plays the French governor of the island and is fun as a good hearted, light villain scheming to marry the heiress himself. He too contributes to the success of this south seas romp. Perhaps the most fun is had from the 3 kids. They are not ""actors"" but they are first quality hams and they tend to steal the show with their campy lines.Sit back and enjoy this one.",5,"A fine, frivolous and fun comedy",1120435200,"07 4, 2005",2005,2312,"['John', 'Wayne', 'not', 'known', 'comedies', 'did', 'do', 'fine', 'work', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'Director', 'John', 'Ford', 'film', 'proof', 'talents', 'not', 'something', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'once', 'fun', 'sweet', 'dated', 'precious', 'Hollywood', 'relic.John', 'Wayne', 'Michael', 'Donovan', 'saloon', 'keeper', 'shipping', 'owner', 'South', 'Seas', 'paradise', 'island', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'Gilhooley', 'brawling', 'friend', 'who', 'up', 'birthday', 'ritual', 'fight', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'out', 'trio', 'Doc', 'What', 'have', 'common', 'were', 'shipwrecked', 'island', 'durnign', 'WWII', 'was', 'Japanese', 'occupation', 'led', 'resistance', 'movement', 'past', 'Now', 'war', 'carried', 'life', 'case', 'Doc', 'married', 'hereditary', 'princess', 'island', 'had', 'three', 'wonderful', 'kids', 'problem', 'daughter', 'prior', 'marriage', 'back', 'Boston', 'who', 'scheming', 'be', 'heiress', 'major', 'shipping', 'line', 'there', 'who', 'out', 'island', 'get', 'evidence', 'father', 'can', 'use', 'show', 'unfit', 'doc', 'making', 'house', 'calls', 'other', 'islands', 'John', 'Wayne', 'steps', 'protect', 'doc', 'claiming', 'kids', 'own', 'Naturally', 'Duke', 'heiress', 'fuss', 'feud', 'know', 'destined', 'be', 'lady.Much', 'film', 'silly', 'not', 'stop', 'being', 'fun', 'film', 'tries', 'be', 'racially', 'diverse', 'style', 'would', 'never', 'go', 'today', 'was', 'quite', 'step', 'forward', '50s', 'little', 'know', 'physical', 'danger', 'alluded', 'war', 'barroom', 'brawls', 'are', 'handled', 'entertainment', 'concerned', 'said', 'silly', 'Wayne', 'films', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'buffoon', 'who', 'be', 'fun', 'even', 'when', 'being', 'insulting', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'little', 'what', 'do', 'well', 'believably', 'Caesar', 'Romero', 'French', 'governor', 'island', 'fun', 'good', 'hearted', 'light', 'villain', 'scheming', 'marry', 'heiress', 'too', 'success', 'south', 'seas', 'romp', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'fun', 'had', '3', 'kids', 'are', 'not', 'actors', 'are', 'first', 'quality', 'hams', 'tend', 'steal', 'show', 'campy', 'lines.Sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'one']",N/A

Donovan's Reef is the last of the three, and in fact was the last picture that Wayne made with Ford. As others have noted, it's a little comedic romp that on one level hasn't aged too well in the last half century -- between the smoking, drinking, somewhat cliche humor and touches of paternalistic racism, it's sometimes hard knowing when to not cringe. Still, it's pure Ford and pure Wayne, supported by an endearing likable cast that includes the likes of Lee Marvin, Dorothy Lamour, Jack Warden and others, and in the end I think it's hard not to wind up enjoying this film.

Well, they can all go and watch Chariot of Fire or whatever since I found Donovan's Reef to be highly entertaining lightweight comedy that proves to be a real pleasure to watch. Like in all John Wayne movies, his effectiveness reflect strongly on how he interact with his supporting cast. In this movie, John Wayne proves to be well supported by Lee Marvin and by Jack Warden who played his naval buddies from the war but the real enjoyment come when Elizabeth Allen come ashore to stirred up some misperceptions due to her strait-laced New England upbringing. Both Wayne and Allen have a wonderful chemisty together which made this movie a delight to see. The three children actors in the movie proves to be great and they all have a great interaction with Wayne which helped the movie out greatly.The movie may appears to be bit dated but its a reflection of the contempory thought when the movie was made. While common today in our nation, half white/half non-white children were not so common back then and by society norm of that period, they were not well regarded. The movie reflects on that perception although to us today, it sounds bit of an over reaction.The performances of all the cast proves to be total delight and the light script told an interesting story that benefited from both comedy and understanding the island life. John Ford's sure handed direction kept the pace going and the movie is rarely ever boring. Mostly filmed on the island of Kauai, the movie portaryed a way of life which have basically disappeared in this overmodernized world.Although panned by the critics, most John Wayne fans will flocked to buy this DVD. There are very little not to like in this movie and it reflects the skills that Wayne processed when playing in a comedy movie.

I immediately loved THIS film, however, and have seen it many times since on TV. I finally bit the bullet and bought it on DVD when it turned up for REALLY cheap on Amazon.Not unsurprisingly, the Technicolor print is stunning (it looks better than any print of the Quiet Man--which won an Oscar for its Technicolor cinematography--I've ever seen); surprisingly, so is the trailer, which comprises the only extra. There are French and English mono tracks in addition to the Dolby digital track, and optional English subtitles. The cheesy menus are only as interactive as menus with few options can be, and there's no hard-copy insert (an immediate minus in my book), hence my one-star demerit. It could be worse--at least it's anamorphic, and its list price accurately reflects Paramount's budget treatment.The film itself is delightful; it was one of John Ford's last, and is a complete joy (I especially got a kick out of his using Dorothy Lamour in a South Seas role...for the second time in 26 years, the first being The Hurricane).

Christenson / Lunamation ""SpaceComics.com""","[5, 6]","Donovan's Reef's about three former war buddies (John Wayne, Jack Warden, Lee Marvin) living on an island in the South Pacific.  The plot is light comedy-romance basically about Wayne trying to cover for Warden when the latter's estranged daughter comes to visit.  Wayne runs a saloon called Donovan's Reef.  Jack Warden (Heaven Can Wait, Being There) is the island doctor, temporarily away on house calls at neighboring islands.  His daughter is unaware of his other children on the island, and it's thought best to keep them secret from her, so Wayne pretends that they are his own children.  When the doctor returns, he keeps up the deception temporarily, while Wayne and the girl are falling in love.  There's really not too much more to it.  A couple bar fights are thrown in just to give Lee Marvin and Dick Foran (Horror Island, In The Navy) - as an Australian Naval officer - something to do.  Cesar Romero (The Great American Broadcast, Batman) is fun to watch as the island governor, who's also interested in the doctor's daughter for her money.The movie is certainly not profound, even compared to John Wayne's lighter westerns, but is pleasantly entertaining, like South Pacific without the music (though Dorothy Lamour does a couple numbers).  To me one of the most memorable scenes was a Christmas celebration narrated by Cesar Romero, with three wise men presenting gifts to the baby Jesus:  The King of Polynesia (Mike Mazurki), the Emperor of China (Jon Fong), and the King of the United States of America (Lee Marvin).  The scenery is beautifully filmed in technicolor, and I'd recommend this movie if you just want to escape for a couple hours through your TV screen to an exotic location, as much to fans of Fantasy Island as to John Wayne fans.  It's also interesting if you're a film trivia buff, for director John Ford brought together a number of old-time actors for a fun time, including Edgar Buchanan (Petticoat Junction, Talk of the Town, Cade's County), Dorothy Lamour, Dick Foran, Mike Mazurki (The Horn Blows At Midnight), Cesar Romero, all the other mentioned above, and too many others to recall.",4,"Colorful scenery, exotic location, nostalgic cast.",1124323200,"08 18, 2005",2005,2129,"['Donovan', 'Reef', 'three', 'former', 'war', 'buddies', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'living', 'island', 'South', 'Pacific', 'plot', 'light', 'comedy-romance', 'basically', 'Wayne', 'trying', 'cover', 'Warden', 'when', 'latter', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'visit', 'Wayne', 'saloon', 'called', 'Donovan', 'Reef', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'Heaven', 'Can', 'Wait', 'Being', 'island', 'doctor', 'temporarily', 'away', 'house', 'calls', 'neighboring', 'islands', 'daughter', 'unaware', 'other', 'children', 'island', 'thought', 'best', 'keep', 'secret', 'Wayne', 'are', 'own', 'children', 'When', 'doctor', 'returns', 'up', 'deception', 'temporarily', 'Wayne', 'girl', 'are', 'falling', 'love', 'really', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'couple', 'bar', 'fights', 'are', 'thrown', 'just', 'give', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'Dick', 'Foran', 'Horror', 'Island', 'Navy', 'Australian', 'Naval', 'officer', 'something', 'do', 'Cesar', 'Romero', 'Great', 'American', 'Broadcast', 'Batman', 'fun', 'watch', 'island', 'governor', 'who', 'also', 'interested', 'doctor', 'daughter', 'money.The', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'profound', 'even', 'compared', 'John', 'Wayne', 'lighter', 'westerns', 'pleasantly', 'entertaining', 'South', 'Pacific', 'music', 'Dorothy', 'Lamour', 'couple', 'numbers', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'was', 'Christmas', 'celebration', 'narrated', 'Cesar', 'Romero', 'three', 'wise', 'men', 'presenting', 'gifts', 'baby', 'Jesus', 'King', 'Polynesia', 'Mike', 'Mazurki', 'Emperor', 'China', 'Jon', 'Fong', 'King', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'scenery', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'technicolor', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'just', 'want', 'escape', 'couple', 'hours', 'TV', 'screen', 'exotic', 'location', 'as', 'much', 'fans', 'Fantasy', 'Island', 'John', 'Wayne', 'fans', 'also', 'interesting', ""'re"", 'film', 'trivia', 'buff', 'director', 'John', 'Ford', 'brought', 'together', 'number', 'old-time', 'actors', 'fun', 'time', 'including', 'Edgar', 'Buchanan', 'Petticoat', 'Junction', 'Talk', 'Town', 'Cade', 'County', 'Dorothy', 'Lamour', 'Dick', 'Foran', 'Mike', 'Mazurki', 'Horn', 'Blows', 'Midnight', 'Cesar', 'Romero', 'other', 'mentioned', 'too', 'many', 'others', 'recall']",N/A

Edward Merrell, Jr. ""emerrell2""","[0, 0]","This was the last collaboration between legendary director, John Ford and one of his favorite leading men, John Wayne. It is far from being one of their better collaborations, but it is still a highly entertaining comedy. Unlike most of their films, this is not a Western, but a romantic comedy set in the South Pacific. Wayne appears a bit uncomfortable in this genre and in this setting and does not deliver one of his better performances. In addition to being a rom/com, the screenplay has a good bit of social commentary - especially regarding racial bigotry, which was a hot-button item in 1963; but also corporate greed and societal hypocrisy...although the message is a bit heavy handed for a comedy. With Lee Marvin starring along with Wayne, you would expect fistfights to erupt extemporaneously from time to time; and you would be right...pointless barroom fights similar to the ones you see in Westerns. On the plus side the movie was filmed in Hawaii and the scenery is gorgeous...the Polynesian flavored soundtrack is also superb. In addition to Wayne and Marvin, look for a stunning Elizabeth Allen as Wayne's love interest...as in many of his late films, she was young enough to be his daughter. Jack Warden delivers the best performance in a film not notable for stellar performances, and Dorothy Lamour and Cesar Romero provide for additional comedy. This is not a great movie by any standard, but Wayne and Ford never made a bad movie and this one is still entertaining, with all its faults.

John Wayne is ""Guns"" Donovan who has retired to a South Sea island paradise after WWII with another buddy Doc Dedham played by Jack Warden.  The third buddy is Lee Marvin as ""Boats"" Gilhooley who shares the same birthdate as Donovan as well as a long-standing rivalry with him over everything, but mostly women.  As the movie opens, Gilhooley finds himself on a merchant ship swabbing the deck near the island and promptly hits the captain over the head with a broom and dives in to swim to shore...to be greeted by Guns.The two exchange pleasantries in the bar Donovan owns called Donovan's Reef and soon it turns into their annual birthday slugfest as the two belt each other silly before Doc Dedham breaks up the brawl.  When told they probably don't even remember the reason for their annual fight, Guns remembers it quite well as Gilhooley had tried to get Guns married to a ""hoochie koochie"" dancer years earlier.  Just a hilarious scene.  Doc Dedham's wife had passed away years earlier and he had then married a native women who had also passed but who had had two children Lelani and a boy named Luki.  Doc also happens to have a wife by his first marriage who is now an adult and a rich society woman.  Amelia Dedham travels to the island to hopefully find her father living the playboy life so he can be cut out of the money he is due from her mother's family.  Gilholley suggests that they slip her a ""mickey"" but Guns has a more practical idea.  He pretends that the Doc's kids are his own and no one mentions his native wife.  Soon the prim and proper Bostonian woman finds herself falling in love with Guns and eventually learning the truth.This is a beautifully filmed movie with spectacular South Seas scenery.  It's a brawling, screwball comedy with fantastic performances not only by the stars, but also by the supporting cast including Cesar Romero as the French Governor of the island who wants off until he learns of Amelia's millions.  Dorothy Lamour is an aged barfly who is constantly after Gilhooley to marry her and big Mike Mazurki is Monk the tough former sergeant who keeps the peace at Donovan's place.

On the South Pacific island of Haleakoloa, everything is going great for three old war buddies, Mike ""Guns"" Donovan, Thomas ""Boats"" Gilhooley, and Doc Dedham.  They live on an island paradise with few worries until Dedham's daughter shows up with hopes of acquiring family money that is coming her way.  The plot drifts more than a little, but that's beside the point.  John Ford wanted to make a rollicking, fun adventure movie, and he pulls it off perfectly with Donovan's Reef.  The movie has its share of comedy, several good brawling scenes, something Ford was great at, and some beautiful cinematography from William H. Clothier.  If you're a fan of the Duke and John Ford, you'll enjoy Donovan's Reef.John Wayne leads an excellent cast as Mike ""Guns"" Donovan, the owner of Donovan's Reef, a Haleakoloa saloon.  Roles like this allowed the Duke to show off his comedic chops, and he's really fun as Donovan.  Lee Marvin is ""Boats"" Gilhooley, Donovan's friend who enjoys women, drinking, and brawling.  Just like Wayne, he's able to play comedy perfectly.  Jack Warden plays Doc Dedham, the island doctor who must deal with his long-lost daughter coming to the island and turning everything upside down.  The WWII backstory of this trio would have made an interesting prequel on its own. Dedham's daughter Amelie is is played by Elizabeth Allen, who holds her own with the leading men.  The rest of this great cast includes Cesar Romero, as the oily island governor, Dorothy Lamour, Mike Mazurki, and Jon Fong.  The DVD has a great looking widescreen presentation which really shows off Clothier's camera work and a trailer.  So for fans of the Duke, Ford, and a good old-fashioned enjoyable movie, check out Donovan's Reef!",4,Last outing for the Duke and John Ford,1148860800,"05 29, 2006",2006,1830,"['Donovan', 'Reef', 'was', 'last', 'movie', 'John', 'Wayne', 'John', 'Ford', 'made', 'together', 'what', 'way', 'go', 'out', 'South', 'Pacific', 'island', 'Haleakoloa', 'everything', 'going', 'great', 'three', 'old', 'war', 'buddies', 'Mike', 'Guns', 'Donovan', 'Thomas', 'Boats', 'Gilhooley', 'Doc', 'Dedham', 'live', 'island', 'paradise', 'few', 'worries', 'Dedham', 'daughter', 'up', 'hopes', 'acquiring', 'family', 'money', 'coming', 'way', 'plot', 'more', 'little', 'beside', 'point', 'John', 'Ford', 'wanted', 'make', 'rollicking', 'fun', 'adventure', 'movie', 'off', 'perfectly', 'Donovan', 'Reef', 'movie', 'share', 'comedy', 'several', 'good', 'brawling', 'scenes', 'something', 'Ford', 'was', 'great', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'William', 'H.', 'Clothier', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Duke', 'John', 'Ford', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'Donovan', 'Reef.John', 'Wayne', 'excellent', 'cast', 'Mike', 'Guns', 'Donovan', 'owner', 'Donovan', 'Reef', 'Haleakoloa', 'saloon', 'Roles', 'allowed', 'Duke', 'show', 'off', 'comedic', 'chops', 'really', 'fun', 'Donovan', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'Boats', 'Gilhooley', 'Donovan', 'friend', 'who', 'women', 'drinking', 'brawling', 'Just', 'Wayne', 'able', 'play', 'comedy', 'perfectly', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'Doc', 'Dedham', 'island', 'doctor', 'who', 'must', 'deal', 'long-lost', 'daughter', 'coming', 'island', 'turning', 'everything', 'upside', 'down', 'WWII', 'backstory', 'trio', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'interesting', 'prequel', 'own', 'Dedham', 'daughter', 'Amelie', 'played', 'Elizabeth', 'Allen', 'who', 'own', 'leading', 'men', 'rest', 'great', 'cast', 'Cesar', 'Romero', 'oily', 'island', 'governor', 'Dorothy', 'Lamour', 'Mike', 'Mazurki', 'Jon', 'Fong', 'DVD', 'great', 'looking', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'really', 'off', 'Clothier', 'camera', 'work', 'trailer', 'So', 'fans', 'Duke', 'Ford', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'check', 'out', 'Donovan', 'Reef']",N/A

218414,A1JJK67VXR1WSR,6300215733,William R. Hancock,"[71, 74]","There are days when things just don't go right. Business doesn't hit on all cylinders, or something in one's personal life is out of alignment. Irritation can set in. Frustration. Just plain old down-in-the-dumps mopeyness.There ARE things that can be done about this, especially if you have a VHS or DVD player. You can pop in any number of good movies and use your scene selector to get you to that ""special part"" that just warms your heart and chases your blues away.You can watch the end of ""Shenandoah"" from the point where Jimmy Stewart goes to the family cemetery to talk to his wife Martha, on through to the arrival of ""the boy"" in the middle of Sunday preaching. Or you can watch James Cagney as George M. Cohan get his Medal of Honor from FDR in ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"", tap dance down the White House steps and join in the troop parade down Pennsylvania Avenue singing ""Over There"". Or you can scene-select to the Von Trapp family singing ""Edelweiss"" as a farewell appearance at the Salzburg Music Festival in ""The Sound of Music"" and then follow them across the alps into Switzerland at the close to that fine film. OR , if the season is right, you can quick jump to the Columbia Inn in Pine Tree, Vermont, in time to see retired General ""Tom Waverly""(Dean Jagger) get sandbagged by Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and company at the surprise reunion of the ""151st Division"" at the end of ""White Christmas"".OR...you can plug in ""Donovans Reef"" and just sit back and LET THE WHOLE THING ROLL!!!!! Because from the first moment of the opening credits, when the delightful, infectious musical rendition of ""Pupa O Ewa"" (""Pearly Shells"") cranks up...until the very end of the film...when ""Pupa O Ewa"" is cranking again...you can just leave your ""doldrums"" behind.A ""downer"" mentality cannot stand up to ""Donovan's Reef"" for long.This 1963 ""swan song"" for the collaborative filmmaking team of John Ford and John Wayne is one of the most enjoyable light comedies ever put to film. There are many movie aficionadoes who love Grant & Hepburn in ""Bringing Up Baby"" , Hepburn & Tracy in ""Adam's Rib"" and such, and you can't ""diss"" classics like ""Some Like It Hot"" and numerous Doris Day vehicles. But me, I say ""Donovan's Reef"" belongs up there with the best of them.There's not a lot of snappy repartee here, but that doesn't matter. Neither does the fact that it seems almost a case of ""Let's make this up as we go along"" moviemaking. ""Hmmmm. This is a Paramount Picture"", set in the South Pacific...Hey!!!...let's get Dorothy Lamour for it!!!!!"". However it was conceived and put together...IT WORKS!!It is a broad, boozy, knuckleheaded comedy that works because it has really good actors in it, having a really good time, turning out a story full of heart...all under the guidance of one of Hollywood's greatest directors.John Wayne is Michael ""Guns' Donovan , bar owner of ""Donovan's Reef""...a place Jimmy Buffet would surely like to visit. Lee Marvin is Donovan's old war buddy ""Boats"" Gilhooly, who is his rival in ""most everything"". They fight a lot, especially since they share the same birthday and neither likes to share. Some of the staged ""altercations"" between them smack of Wayne vs. McGlaglen in ""The Quiet Man"". Jack Warden is the local missionary doctor, a widower twice over, who has three children by a polynesian wife (royalty), and one older daughter from his first marraige in America.Island frivolities get sidetracked when word comes that the older daughter (a ""proper Bostonian"") is coming to see her father(on a covert investigatory mission to see if a will can be broken). Suspecting this daughter, Amelia (Elizabeth Allen), might be a racist who might hurtfully interact with her mixed race siblings, Wayne & company stage a ""switcheroo"" con on Ms. Dedham from Boston...one which represents the Duke (""Guns"") as their father and not ""The Doc"".The course of the film is about establishing the con and then maintaining it.  They fail in this, but it turns out not to matter. Amelia is not entirely the prig they take her to be...and by the end of the movie she is no prig at all.This is a fun movie to watch and experience. The cast is uniformly great. Cesar Romero is a hoot as the French colonial governor, as is John Fong as his assistant. Mike Mazurki is funny as a local gendarme and Marcel Dalio evokes his own share of chuckles as the island priest. The children are played quite well by Jacqueline Malouf, Cherylene Lee, and Tim Stafford. Jacqueline Malouf, in particular, is appealingly winsome as Leilani, the eldest of the three island children and the heir to her mother's throne. A scene near the end of the film where Amelia realizes Leilani is her sister and overturns ""the con"" is absolutely...exhiliratingly...heart warming.Is this a feel-good movie? You betcha. A ""South Seas"" state of mind caught on quite strongly in the early 1960s. This trend had three basic points of origin...the play and film version of ""South Pacific"", a very popular television series called ""Adventures In Paradise"", and good old ""Donovan's Reef"".Three good deals, all the way around.As for Duke's end of the deal,this DVD edition of ""Reef"" is just beautiful. The sound is superb, as is the image transfer. The colors of Hawaii come out gloriously in this...as one would expect when the lens work was done by William Clothier, one of the greatest of all Hollywood cinematographers. And Cyril Mockridge's musical scoring is sublime, especially his choice to feature ""Pupa O Ewa"" extensively in the movie. That song gets under your skin and STAYS there...and will often come back to stick in your mind when you are nowhere near a television set or DVD player.""Donovan's Reef"" ...or ""Gilhooly's Reef""...makes no nevermind to me. I love it just the same.
