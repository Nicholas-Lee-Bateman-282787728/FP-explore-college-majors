I love her personality, instruction and cueing but I'm NOT a huge fan of ALL of her DVDs so I'm not that loved up.I am however a big fan of & love her sculpting DVDs which all use light hand weights. This one plus Slim Sculpt and Skinny Sculpt. Ellen also leads CRUNCH: Burn & Firm Pilates (which also uses weights and is pretty good).Sleek Sculpt Express is a 30 minute workout which combines Ellen's usual strength, stretch and some cardio for a gentle yet effective workout. I am a fan of how she works you out but doesn't leave you feeling like you've done something super hectic and therefore need to go meditate to bring back some calmness. Because of this and her excellent cueing, you are always able to keep up with her and not injure yourself as you rush to keep up (as has happened to me using another well known instructor's DVDs).Not a fan of the music in this one at first - the chanting sounded rather mournful but after awhile I am able to drown out/ignore the music and concentrate on form. I like to pair this DVD with either cardio (interval speeds on the treadmill) or another 30 minute DVD (i.e. doing Super Fast Body Blast first then Sleek Sculpt Express I really felt it in the glutes the next day - awesome!)Ellen's DVDs are for those who want a peaceful/centred vibe after their workouts - if you're an energiser bunny (or hard core athlete) into the crazy stuff like insanity (no pun intended) then Ellen's not for you.

Even though I've done tougher workouts than this, this is a great way to either begin again, or just begin.  It's tougher than it looks and each movement is fluid and easy.  You are never stopping throughout the entire workout and so your heart rate also gets up there quite a bit.  It's just under 30 minutes, and it incorporates a small warm up and cool down in that time.  Ellen is a good, clear instructor and she's encouraging too without being annoying.  The other two exercisers on the DVD are smiley and one is even showing that the same workout can be done without weights.I suggest light dumbbells to start with because you really are continuously moving your arms and so you don't want to be too fatigued too soon.  As you do this more often, you'll be able to increase the weight.  At the end of the DVD, she says that your energy level will be on high for quite some time after you're done, and she's not wrong.

Her workouts are more polished and thoughtful and because of the yoga pilate influence you feel a calming effect as well as toning and getting your heart rate up. This is only 30 minutes but you get your heart rate up and it is quite strenuous. I have been working out for over thirty years so this did not make me sore but it made me tired the next day and slightly achy. I felt the moves were great and the music funky and quite different from her usual.Ellen of course is great and pays great attention to detail. I recommend this highly and you will get a great short workout that really puts you thru your paces. Along with eating right and watching your calories this will give you a sculpted look like a dancer and not a bulky look. I am 63 inches tall and a assize 2 to 3 at 47 so I most assuredly do not want a bulky look but prefer sleek and sculpted and this will give you this look.,5,One of Ellens best!,1378598400,"09 8, 2013",2013,1106,"['have', 'been', 'working', 'out', 'ellen', 'Debbie', 'Siebers', 'advanced', 'slim', 'n', 'six', 'almost', 'year', 'now', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'very', 'impressed', 'have', 'seen', 'great', 'results', 'even', 'workouts', 'are', 'not', 'high', 'impact', 'workouts', 'are', 'more', 'polished', 'thoughtful', 'yoga', 'pilate', 'influence', 'feel', 'calming', 'effect', 'as', 'well', 'toning', 'getting', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'only', '30', 'minutes', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'quite', 'strenuous', 'have', 'been', 'working', 'out', 'thirty', 'years', 'so', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'sore', 'made', 'tired', 'next', 'day', 'slightly', 'achy', 'felt', 'moves', 'were', 'great', 'music', 'funky', 'quite', 'different', 'usual.Ellen', 'course', 'great', 'great', 'attention', 'detail', 'recommend', 'highly', 'will', 'get', 'great', 'short', 'workout', 'really', 'thru', 'paces', 'eating', 'right', 'watching', 'calories', 'will', 'give', 'sculpted', 'look', 'dancer', 'not', 'bulky', 'look', 'am', '63', 'inches', 'tall', 'assize', '2', '3', '47', 'so', 'most', 'assuredly', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'bulky', 'look', 'prefer', 'sleek', 'sculpted', 'will', 'give', 'look']",Ellen Barrett Live : Sleek Sculpt Express

I feel I worked as hard or harder in 30 minutes than I did with the previous longer workouts.  Although this is primarily a sculpting workout, I felt my heart rate really rise during the segment where you have to plie and touch your dumbbells to the ground repeatedly.  I would rate this as a solid intermediate with no time wasted; a lot of great compound movements.  Ellen does all one side in the first 15 minutes and then you switch sides for the last 15 minutes.  You get the same pleasant, airy set as her previous Live workouts with two background exercisers; one shows easier modifications.  I used three-pound dumbbells throughout and I would not have wanted to go any higher for intensity or safety purposes for these mostly long-lever movements.There is no dedicated warm-up, but since this workout only uses light weights, I really didn't feel it was necessary.  As an all-standing workout that emphasizes time efficiency, there is only a short cool-down and a few active stretches.  However, when you are doing a 30-minute routine, something has to give.The music is better than a lot of Ellen's previous offerings and the sound volume is excellent.
