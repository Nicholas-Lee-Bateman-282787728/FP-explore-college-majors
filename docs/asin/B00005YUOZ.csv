690802,A10WCSGF78M2KE,B00005YUOZ,Alfonso A.,"[7, 16]","Allen Iverson will probably never get the respect he fully deserves. What do I mean by this? This talented young man has lead the NBA in scoring despite being just under 6 feet. He lead a mediocre team to the Finals in 2001. And he handles the ball as if it were &quot;on a string&quot;. Yet, other players get more respect from the media. Here's a list of whom A.I. deserves more respect over:1- Kobe Bryant=The man is a ball hog. All he wants is the glory and it's plain to see it. Great players don't try. They just do it.2- Tim Duncan=This guy is way over-rated. He can not even play well in the clutch.3- Grant Hill=What has he really done? And yet, he STILL gets more respect.4- The rest of the NBA.Iverson is hands down the NBA's top player. Imagine if he were a few inches taller. Definitely the heir to Jordan's throne. He even shook off 'ol Jordan and made him slip as he scored a basket. Let's see how much longer the media dogs this man. As far as the DVD goes, if you want to see what a true player is like, get this. This man is not going to cry and make excuses unlike OTHER players when he doesn't play well. Allen has been holding it down ever since Georgetown! You didn't know?

It evn shows the moves he did on MJ back in college. It shows his high school football as a quarterback, special team, and running back and it also shows him playing basketball in high school and in Georgetown. It shows him being the #1 draft pick by the Sixers back in '98. It also shows the tremendous run to the NBA Finals against the annoying Lakers (except Shaq). But it also explains his childhood and his going to jail because of drinking problems. Overall, this video thoroughly explains AI's life and career and even includes some interviews.",5,Great story.,1031011200,"09 3, 2002",2002,669,"['only', 'bad', 'thing', 'video', 'wish', 'was', 'longer', 'lifetime', 'story', 'career', 'sports', 'moves', 'did', 'MJ', 'back', 'college', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'quarterback', 'special', 'team', 'running', 'back', 'also', 'playing', 'basketball', 'high', 'school', 'Georgetown', 'being', '1', 'draft', 'pick', 'Sixers', 'back', ""'98"", 'also', 'tremendous', 'run', 'NBA', 'Finals', 'annoying', 'Lakers', 'Shaq', 'also', 'childhood', 'going', 'jail', 'drinking', 'problems', 'Overall', 'video', 'thoroughly', 'AI', 'life', 'career', 'even', 'interviews']",N/A

This is the way a NBA dvd should be made.  I was surprised at allen iverson's youth and his story from his upbringing.  You get a chance to know him as a person and the highlights and HS football footage are amazing.The top 10 plays are not that great except that crossover on jordan that looks like a and1 streetball classic that makes jordan look silly .... but the hightlights in the other bonus footage and the actual program are fantastic...I forgot how high iverson can jump - he used to dunk wild in college and early pro years...its amazing to see that again....what a great player for a 6 footer in NBA...he went and represented USA in olympics when punks like garnett, kidd, ray allen, shaq , mike bibby, richard hamilton quit on our country .  at least iverson went over there and never played scared and earned my respect as he answered questions and never made excuses...he's legit and this DVD is among the best the NBA has produced...right up there with michael jordan's stuff....",5,the Answer,1095638400,"09 20, 2004",2004,1113,"['Now', 'here', 'DVD', 'NBA', 'really', 'good', 'bonus', 'features', 'actual', 'program', 'are', 'fantastic', 'way', 'NBA', 'dvd', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'was', 'surprised', 'allen', 'iverson', 'youth', 'story', 'upbringing', 'get', 'chance', 'know', 'person', 'highlights', 'HS', 'football', 'footage', 'are', 'amazing.The', 'top', '10', 'plays', 'are', 'not', 'great', 'crossover', 'jordan', 'and1', 'streetball', 'classic', 'jordan', 'look', 'silly', 'hightlights', 'other', 'bonus', 'footage', 'actual', 'program', 'are', 'fantastic', 'forgot', 'how', 'high', 'iverson', 'can', 'jump', 'used', 'dunk', 'wild', 'college', 'early', 'pro', 'years', 'amazing', 'see', 'again', 'great', 'player', '6', 'footer', 'NBA', 'went', 'represented', 'USA', 'olympics', 'when', 'punks', 'garnett', 'kidd', 'ray', 'allen', 'shaq', 'mike', 'bibby', 'richard', 'hamilton', 'quit', 'country', 'least', 'iverson', 'went', 'never', 'played', 'scared', 'earned', 'respect', 'answered', 'questions', 'never', 'made', 'excuses', 'legit', 'DVD', 'best', 'NBA', 'produced', 'right', 'there', 'michael', 'jordan', 'stuff']",N/A
