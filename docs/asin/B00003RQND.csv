546319,A2PDC6SESC021Q,B00003RQND,,"[0, 0]","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a very good movie.  It is the continuation of the first Harry Potter and when he is 12 years old.  Like the first one it is extremely long but the movie makes up for that.  First of all be ready to listen to some weird voices(LOL) because the actors are clearly going through puberty.  But still, the acting is good.  The books are better but the movie still captures the ""magic""(lol) of the books, but they definetly shouldn't of been made so early on.  If you have read the books you already know what the movie is about.  It's about a problem in Hogwarts that has to do with Voldermort, and there are many plot twists.  It has more action than the original.  This movie is also more scary.In this the special effects are great, better than the first definetly.  The Basilisk is cool looking.  The flying car and the willow tree look nice too.  The Quidditch is definetly improved.  Of course it's not perfect, but there's not alot wrong with it.

546323,A2B4Q6OVGD3S1V,B00003RQND,,"[0, 1]","This season is the beginning of what was to come for ""The X-Files"". Unlike all other seasons, this one is not spliced together with the classic alien mythology episodes the series is now famous for. Instead, it's an entire season of stand-alone episodes, spare a few alien stories. Although lacking the wonderful mythology arc, this season began the classic X-Files formula and changed TV forever. Starting with the excellent Pilot episode, each episode is a monster-of-the-week type thing, a kind of homage to shows like ""The Twilight Zone"". The elements are all in place: the dark atmosphere, the creepy plots, and great cinematography. The first half of the season is okay, despite a few lost efforts such as ""The Jersey Devil"" and ""Ghost in the Machine"". The series really picks up with ""Ice"", placing Mulder and Scully in the arctic with parasitic worms. The last half of the season is more entertaining, with more intriguing stories. While the lack of the mythology arc puts a damper on the season, the stand-alone episodes are some of the classics. ""Eve"", ""Fire"", ""Beyond the Sea"", ""Tooms"", etc. All are great episodes that stand out to establish a medium for ""The X-Files"". Probably the most serious season, it lacks some of the bubbly humor and comedic efforts that follow in later seasons. No casual jokes are exchanged between Mulder and Scully and the most emotional episode is probably ""Beyond the Sea"", which deals with the death of Scully's father. The season wraps up its scattered alien episodes with what some consider the first true mythology episode ""The Erlenmeyer Flask"". Despite being a terrific episode that launchs the series and is the stepping stone for seasons to come, it's a great season finale, maybe the best episode of the season. While its rigidness and seriousness brings it down a bit, this is classic television. And besides, fans didn't know what was to come and knew next to nothing of the mythology. This is the season that starts it all. Everything is set up, the potential is there, and a phenomenon is born.",4,The classic beginning.,1023321600,"06 6, 2002",2002,2050,"['season', 'beginning', 'what', 'was', 'come', 'X-Files', 'other', 'seasons', 'one', 'not', 'spliced', 'together', 'classic', 'alien', 'mythology', 'series', 'now', 'famous', 'Instead', 'entire', 'season', 'stand-alone', 'episodes', 'spare', 'few', 'alien', 'stories', 'lacking', 'wonderful', 'mythology', 'arc', 'season', 'began', 'classic', 'X-Files', 'formula', 'changed', 'TV', 'forever', 'Starting', 'excellent', 'Pilot', 'episode', 'episode', 'monster-of-the-week', 'type', 'thing', 'kind', 'homage', 'shows', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'elements', 'are', 'place', 'dark', 'atmosphere', 'creepy', 'plots', 'great', 'cinematography', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'okay', 'few', 'lost', 'efforts', 'such', 'Jersey', 'Devil', 'Ghost', 'Machine', 'series', 'really', 'up', 'Ice', 'placing', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'arctic', 'parasitic', 'worms', 'last', 'half', 'season', 'more', 'entertaining', 'more', 'intriguing', 'stories', 'lack', 'mythology', 'arc', 'damper', 'season', 'stand-alone', 'episodes', 'are', 'classics', 'Eve', 'Fire', 'Sea', 'Tooms', 'etc', 'are', 'great', 'episodes', 'stand', 'out', 'establish', 'medium', 'X-Files', 'Probably', 'most', 'serious', 'season', 'bubbly', 'humor', 'comedic', 'efforts', 'follow', 'later', 'seasons', 'casual', 'jokes', 'are', 'exchanged', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'most', 'emotional', 'episode', 'probably', 'Sea', 'death', 'Scully', 'father', 'season', 'up', 'scattered', 'alien', 'episodes', 'what', 'consider', 'first', 'true', 'mythology', 'episode', 'Erlenmeyer', 'Flask', 'being', 'terrific', 'episode', 'series', 'stepping', 'stone', 'seasons', 'come', 'great', 'season', 'finale', 'maybe', 'best', 'episode', 'season', 'rigidness', 'seriousness', 'brings', 'down', 'bit', 'classic', 'television', 'fans', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'come', 'knew', 'next', 'nothing', 'mythology', 'season', 'Everything', 'set', 'up', 'potential', 'there', 'phenomenon', 'born']",The X-Files - The Complete First Season
546324,A1806QLIG0NXHR,B00003RQND,,"[0, 1]","When the first season of X-Files premiered, I was finishing high school. Already, I found myself bored with the teen dramas, medical shows and cop shows that dominated television. Having always been a ""little out there"" among my friends, I longed for something to watch that appealed to my inner sci-fi geek.And I found it.Aliens, government conspiracies, genetic mutants, UFOs, vampires... Mulder and Scully seemed to find it all. And it all wove into a complex story-arc that spanned multiple seasons.This show used pop-culture to generate its own sub-culture. Say ""small potatoes"", ""Spooky Mulder"" or ""ratboy"" to an X-Phile and watch their expression. They'll know what you mean. Suddenly, it was cool again to be a geek, to wonder about the Rainbow Project or Area 51.And from there, a new era. Millenium, Roswell, Buffy, Angel, Charmed, Dark Angel, Smallville - all shows that I honestly don't believe would have seen the light of day had something not paved the way back for the extreme to get back into the American mainstream.Season One was certainly not the best season. Definitely, the acting and dialogue could have used some help, but absolutely necessary to understand later seasons. Season One sets up the basic story arc.Fox Mulder - former profiler, now basement dweller. In charge of the X-Files due to his obsession with the mysterious childhood disappearance of his sister, Samantha.Dana Scully - impeccable pathologist brought in to debunk and rein in Mulder's wilder assertions.Together, they form a partnership and balance each other out. Scully reins Mulder in, Mulder forces Scully to see beyond the easily explained.

546329,A3HTX1NOTTWERP,B00003RQND,,"[2, 5]","In September 1993, the US Network station FOX needed a TV show to help it stay stable. They expected little of this odd show from Chris Carter. It was called The X-Files and was a hit. It went from popular cult to become a global phenomenon. Never before has a TV show been so popular...except maybe Baywatch, but we all know half the viewers were just watching it for Pamela Anderson, don't we? No, this was a TV show of extreme quality and class. Yes, it was about aliens and the occult, but that didn't matter - OK, it did...but not to the extent that it was all they explored. Beneath the surface of all this sci-fi was the rare and unique chemistry of Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. Played by David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson respectively, the two were perfect for the roles of the two agents. This factor - along with the storylines - is the strong point of the show. The two are simply legendary characters in TV history and are definitely the most symbolic TV show characters of all-time. Except for, of course, Pamela Anderson's famous pair.In the Season One opening episode - ""Pilot"" - FBI Agent Dana Scully is assigned to work with fellow FBI Agent Fox Mulder. The X-Files is opened; a series of cases in which the two agents are assigned by the FBI Headquarters in Washington D.C. to investigate unexplainable and downright freaky occurrences that take place up and down the US. Scully is the serious-minded medical scientist who seems to have a negative response to most, if not all, of Mulder's theories. Mulder, on the other hand, is the one that believes in almost anything he sees possible. He is incredibly determined to prove the existence of extra-terrestrial life, expose the government's secret plans and much more at any chance he gets. Scully is more laid-back on the whole subject and always seems to have a more believable theory on a certain subject than Mulder. The episode is very strong for a pilot episode and pulls it off to superb effect. The episodes throughout the entire nine year of The X-Files are split into two - the mythological episodes and the stand-alone episodes. The former deal with the sci-fi arc of the show which is its main focus, and the stand-alone episodes deal with a vast range of occult subjects such as grisly murders, psychic happenings, urban legends, religion, possession and much more. The mythological episodes are few and far between in Season One, but they are superior treats when they come about.In ""Deep Throat,"" a tip from a secret government contact leads Mulder and Scully on a trail of missing test pilots and a possible government cover-up of a UFO crash site. In ""Fallen Angel,"" the future of The X-Files project is threatened when Mulder infiltrates a secret government cover up of a UFO crash site. In the episode ""E.B.E.,"" a UFO is shot down over the Middle East and secretly transported to the US. Mulder and Scully are sent on a wild UFO chase by Deep Throat, only to find it does not exist and they have been sent to distract them from preventing the truth - whatever it is - from prevailing. In the final episode of Season One - ""The Erlenmeyer Flask"" - Scully uncovers startling and shocking evidence that the US government has been secretly testing alien DNA on humans with disastrous results. Deep Throat is also killed in this episode and The X-Files project is officially shut down.The stand-alone episodes of The X-Files Season One are all outstanding. Rarely does a television show produce top notch episodes time and time again, but The X-Files does it easily. Highlights include ""Squeeze,"" ""The Jersey Devil,"" ""Ghost In The Machine,"" ""Fire,"" ""Lazarus,"" ""Miracle Man,"" ""Shapes,"" ""Darkness Falls,"" ""Tooms,"" ""Born Again"" and ""Roland."" In ""Ice,"" the agents are stranded in a remote Arctic research station and stalked by a worm-like parasite that controls the mind of its host. ""Eve"" is a chilling episode in which the agents discover an eugenics experiment that has produced a race of identical, extremely intelligent and murderous children.Gillian Anderson's shining moment of glory comes in ""Beyond The Sea."" Scully's father dies suddenly and they investigate a case in which the only way they can locate an elusive kidnapper is to enlist the help of a death-row inmate with psychic powers. The inmate also knows a message which Scully's father tried to tell her before he died. The episode is emotionally tough for Scully and Anderson is awesome when she confronts the psychic about how he tricked Mulder towards the end of the episode. ""Gender Bender"" is a misunderstood episode that many people find rubbish, but I find rather entertaining. Bizarre murders are committed by a killer who can change sex at will. The agents are led to a town with a simple and seemingly ordinary tribe, who is hiding a much larger and darker secret. I really was scared for Mulder and Scully when they returned back to the house of these strange folk in the middle of the night. Something about those people and the way they act frightened me to death!OVERALL GRADE: 10/10If you're a fan of the X-Files, the Season One DVD Box Set is absolutely essential as this is where it all began!

Falcon,"[0, 0]","Since so much about The X-Files has already been written on this Web site, I won't add to the stockpile of reviews of what is arguably one of the greatest shows in television history. Instead, I will comment on the less expensive, albeit cheaply made, reissue of the show.Although the DVD cases in this edition are slim, they are inferior in quality. Made by Scanavo, these flimsy cases have sharp-edged hubs, so you must proceed with caution when attaching a disc, since a slip will guarantee a scratch or two. Moreover, the hubs have teeth that can easily break off. Don't confuse these cases with the superior Thinpak cases, made by Nexpak. The Thinpaks are far more durable than the Scanavo cases and have smooth push buttons, allowing the discs to be attached and removed effortlessly.The DVDs in these boxed sets also have flaws, but fortunately mostly cosmetic in nature. I have seasons one to six, and a handful of the discs have scratches or smudges. Granted, these defects are generally innocuous (so far no problems with the playback in season one), but who wants brand-new discs that look as though they've been thrown around a few times? One disc I received had a hairline crack in the center, so I returned the set (I can tolerate scratches but not cracks), which Amazon immediately replaced.These new sets cost less than the original ones, but you'll get few extra features and you'll get shoddy quality. Those who can't afford the preposterously overpriced original sets will have to settle for the cheap stuff. (Thanks Fox, again.)But I'll close on a good note. The most important aspect of any DVD is the playback quality, and in this respect the DVDs in season one reveal the truth: a good picture (generally), clean sound, a superlative show.",4,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,1144886400,"04 13, 2006",2006,1762,"['so', 'much', 'X-Files', 'already', 'been', 'written', 'Web', 'site', 'wo', ""n't"", 'add', 'stockpile', 'reviews', 'what', 'arguably', 'one', 'greatest', 'shows', 'television', 'history', 'Instead', 'will', 'comment', 'less', 'expensive', 'cheaply', 'made', 'reissue', 'show.Although', 'DVD', 'cases', 'edition', 'are', 'slim', 'are', 'inferior', 'quality', 'Made', 'Scanavo', 'flimsy', 'cases', 'have', 'sharp-edged', 'hubs', 'must', 'proceed', 'caution', 'when', 'attaching', 'disc', 'slip', 'will', 'guarantee', 'scratch', 'two', 'Moreover', 'hubs', 'have', 'teeth', 'can', 'easily', 'break', 'off', 'Do', ""n't"", 'confuse', 'cases', 'superior', 'Thinpak', 'cases', 'made', 'Nexpak', 'Thinpaks', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'durable', 'Scanavo', 'cases', 'have', 'smooth', 'push', 'buttons', 'allowing', 'discs', 'be', 'attached', 'removed', 'effortlessly.The', 'DVDs', 'boxed', 'sets', 'also', 'have', 'flaws', 'fortunately', 'mostly', 'cosmetic', 'nature', 'have', 'seasons', 'one', 'six', 'handful', 'discs', 'have', 'scratches', 'smudges', 'Granted', 'defects', 'are', 'generally', 'innocuous', 'so', 'far', 'problems', 'playback', 'season', 'one', 'who', 'brand-new', 'discs', 'look', ""'ve"", 'been', 'thrown', 'few', 'times', 'One', 'disc', 'received', 'had', 'hairline', 'crack', 'center', 'returned', 'set', 'can', 'tolerate', 'scratches', 'not', 'cracks', 'Amazon', 'immediately', 'replaced.These', 'new', 'sets', 'cost', 'less', 'original', 'ones', ""'ll"", 'get', 'few', 'extra', 'features', ""'ll"", 'get', 'shoddy', 'quality', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'preposterously', 'overpriced', 'original', 'sets', 'will', 'have', 'settle', 'cheap', 'stuff', 'Thanks', 'Fox', 'again', ""'ll"", 'close', 'good', 'note', 'most', 'important', 'aspect', 'DVD', 'playback', 'quality', 'respect', 'DVDs', 'season', 'one', 'reveal', 'truth', 'good', 'picture', 'generally', 'clean', 'sound', 'superlative', 'show']",The X-Files - The Complete First Season

546335,A3A0OXF6MS1X7B,B00003RQND,A. Ives,"[0, 0]","I must say that the first season gets off to a bit of a slow start. I have never gone back and watched a series and failed to see kinks needing to be worked out in the actors portrayal of the characters, i.e. Spock's goofy (at times) acting in the pilot episode of Star Trek. What I have noticed as I have revisited the series is that the clumsiness of Duchnovy is just about done after the first episode and completely worked out a few episodes after that. I have noticed that with Gillian Anderson (I am in the Third season now) that the building of her character is very gradual and natural. By the third season, she is wonderful (more so than before). I will also note that these are 1 hr. episodes minus commercials, thus equaling about 45 mins. Also, there are around 24 episodes a season and you get a bonus disc with each season. This price is more than reasonable! The original Star Trek only beats the X-files in terms of how much (length-wise) you get per season. Try finding that now. Not possible that I know of. And 35 bucks? Even if you were only moderately into X-files when it came out as I was, watching every episode and not having to wait a week in between each one makes a huge difference. I am only now beginning to realize how great this series was. And the episodes, while only under exception(a to be continued, for example) need be watched in order, there are huge benefits to not missing any episodes and seeing the whole thing in order. Anyway, you won't be dissappointed if you are a fan and perhaps you'll even be surprised as a luke-warm fan. And my humble advice is if you aren't quite convinced at first, wait till about half-way through the third disc. The second half of the first season was so great that it made up for the slow (though definitely not boring) first half. Only way to do it cheaper is to rent from Netflix, but after you spend a year or so (maybe an exaggeration) getting through the entire series, you might start it up again in a few years. And there's always passing it on to friends. Anyway, I recommend it however you do it. I'm very picky about movies, and as for tv, I normally don't even bother, but for me, this is one to own. I've got seasons 1-5 and will get even up to 8 where duchovny had no major role, also the two movies.Also, I thought I would mention that the complete Twilight Zone last time I checked (here) was way lower than i've ever seen. I got it for 125. At one point, I paid 75 for season 4 and there are 5 seasons total. Also, the complete outerlimits is really cheap, though I've never seen the series, but will give it a try.",5,The necessary intro to X-files. Great price for Many 1 hr.

I see episodes virtually everyday, but believe me, the first season remains to be one of my favorites to watch out for. Let me ellaborate a little.The show when first aired Pilot episode,no one had imagined what it would be! TV was boring during those days here at best, but X Files changed the way fusion crossover shows would be done. There are at least dozens of shows which evolved from X Files itself. i remember episode 3x24 where in a restaurant a man heals a hit man with his palm, this was same as Roswell's pilot episode and what was to follow. Several tags, like the truth is out there!, trust no one!, Spooky became suddenly lingo of the generation.Pilot episode was strongest episodes i have ever seen, series like Sopranos,Star Trek, SG1,Roswell etc dont even come closer to match the intensity of what X Files had just produced. Fox mulder's exuberance over an abductee case and Scully's insistance on finding a mundane explanation keeps us hooked to come to overall conclusion.Deep throat -- all i can say is : the is THE best episode in history of X Files and perhaps the whole television( a daring statement).The background score (crisp and better than the x files title soundtrack), the acting, Deep throat's introduction was all so fast paced and so seamless that you wonder sometimes: if this episode was a movie or a part of series?!Greatness was all over it.Season 1 is where are all the charracters are introduced, and all the shows have the values that all of us have come to be fanatic about over the years of the show.

Four main elements launched it into television history:  First, the ""buddy"" television show pairing together a single man and a single woman working together has a long history, but it really hadn't worked well since ""Moonlighting"" in the mid-80's.  Everyone loves the potential for romance between the two main characters, even if nothing ever happens on-screen.Second, millions of viewers had been waiting for a show with just a little of the weird and unusual.  Not like Star Trek, which is set in the future, but something set in the here and now.  Something (with a little stretch of the imagination) that COULD happen here.  Now.Third, the actors were good.Fourth, the writing was generally very good.The first season's episodes work best when the relationship between Mulder and Scully is developed and/or jeopardized as in ""Ice,"" ""Beyond the Sea,"" and ""The Erlenmeyer Flask.""  Any episode that contained Deep Throat or the Cigarette-Smoking Man added even more interest.  Episodes that don't work as well are missing these elements, such as ""Space"" and ""Eve.""  Still, even the episodes that aren't the best of the season are still pretty good, better than the majority of stuff on television then AND now.This first season collection is first-rate.

546365,A20IIR0422G3A5,B00003RQND,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[3, 4]","`X-Files, Season 1' DVDs from the show which premiered in September, 1993, created by Chris Carter and starring David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson gives us a complete, but not especially `rich' look at a show which seemed to fill the void left by the fall of `The Evil Empire', and not yet filled by Arab terrorists. The filler was stories about `paranormal' phenomena, extraterrestials, and unexplained events in general.I was not a fan of the show when it first aired, and I have virtually no memory of even seeing any of the episodes, so I'm looking at it with fresh eyes. The worst thing to have happened to the `X-Files' may have been the advent of several new shows based on FBI operations, especially `Numb3rs' and `Criminal Minds'. Both shows demonstrate agents operating within an agency which has returned to hero status it enjoyed back in the days of `The FBI' and, indirectly `The Untouchables'. In the new shows, the agency is never pictured as something between a sluggishly conservative drag on investigation and a positively evil bureaucracy with an agenda which is not entirely behind `Truth, Justice, and The American Way', not to mention logic and just plain good sense.In contrast to the modern fictional FBI operatives, the show's agents, Fox Muldur and Dana Scully seem to operate almost entirely on their own, more tolerated than supported by their superiors. It's appropriate that most action seems to take place in a Stanley Kubrick cum Ridley Scott darkness and dimly lit environment. I'm hard pressed to picture a single scene done in the bright light of day under bright blue sky. The bureaucratic muddle is blurred even further by the occasional appearance of a mysterious character identified as `Deep Throat' who provides little clues and encouragement to Muldur when his interest or enthusiasm flags or he runs into a dead end. The similarity with the famous Watergate `Deep Throat' figure is obvious and I suspect the character is added not as a `deux Ex machina' to move the plot on when it gets stuck, but as a device to further picture higher levels of government as a cross between malevolent and stupid. It would have been an interesting take on the whole fictional backstory if the show had played the higher levels of the Federal government as they really were in these matters, indifferent and self-servingly protective of their own turf. This could have been a comedy precursor to `The Office', but I digress.All in all, the show tries to entertain two opposing points of view, and work off the tension between them. One point of view is that the subject of Muldur's cases are not detectable by normal means, therefore, `official' government assigns a minimal staff to the `X-Files' to mollify those dimwits who actually believe in this stuff. The opposing point of view is that while these phenomena are not amenable to `normal' methods, they are real, meaning they are amenable to SOME method, as yet not soundly based in scientific procedure. A fine example of this is the discovery of the planet Neptune by its gravitational effect on Uranus. Astronomers couldn't see it, but they had evidence it was there, leading to newer telescopes and a knowledge of where to look, so they eventually did see it. So, if the `real' but unseen premise is true, one can be sure that `official' organizations would be pursuing it as vigorously and as rigorously as they pursue e coli contamination of spinach and terrorist sleeper cells.To be sure, there are stories such as `Ice' where the danger is not `paranormal', but simply `new' and heightened by isolation from assistance. One problem with several episodes like `Ice' is that their plot is all too obviously `borrowed' from a well-known previous movie. In this case, it's `The Thing'. In other cases, the danger is simply a small extension from normal phenomena, so that to the normal mind, there is nothing special going on, except that our hero Muldur know things are not quite as they seem.While there is much about the `X-Files' which may seem dated or improbable, it was successful because it is still entertaining in a melodramatic fashion. In fact, unlike all our modern cop and investigative shows, the two principle characters seem to find themselves in life-threatening jeopardy in practically every episode. In `CSI' and `Law and Order' and `NCIS' and `Numb3rs' and `Criminal Minds' and `Cold Case Files' and so on and so on, we don't get a major character in life threatening situations more than once or twice a season, and then only in sweeps weeks. The show also gains heat from the interaction between the two principal characters. In the commentary on DVD 7, the show's creator says they wanted to avoid any romantic entanglements between Muldur and Scully. In it's place, they have a strong regard and caring relationship between the two, not unlike the connection between Benson and Stabler on `Law and Order, SVU', except that the `X-Files' relationship has fewer internal stresses, and must simply deal with threats and strains introduced by the perps.The extras on this DVD set are modest. On each disc with four shows apiece, the only extras are a few scenes for one of the shows in a foreign language, and it isn't always the same language. It ranges from Italian to Japanese and several points in between. The extras on the seventh `bonus' disc are nice, but not earthshaking. We learn, for example, that the name `Scully' comes from the Los Angeles Dodgers radio commentator, Vin Scully and that Gillian Anderson was pregnant near the end of the first season.I've just recently developed a taste for these 14-year-old shows, and I suspect that the value of the DVDs is inversely proportional to how much you saw them when they first aired. If you are seeing them for the first time, you will like them.",5,A very different kind of FBI.

546366,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B00003RQND,Bobby Underwood,"[0, 0]","This finely crafted and involving series, created by Chris Carter, kept intelligent people home on Friday nights to watch Fox Mulder and Dana Scully investigate the strange and paranormal. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson became two F.B.I. agents no respectable TV viewer could live without. Right from the start, it set the arc for the entire series and we watched in awe as Carter and his fine group of writers turned television into something new.Mulder was an Oxford educated profiler with such a great success rate it allowed him to indulge himself when he latched onto buried boxes of case files dating back to J. Edgar Hoover called The X-Files. They were cases which couldn't be explained or solved by any normal investigative methods. Mulder, however could solve them, not only because he was good enough, but because he believed.The reason Mulder believed was the story arc for his insatiable need to discover the truth about what the government knew about alien abduction. Muldor himself, as a young boy, had been unable to save his younger sister Samantha the night she was taken, and it both drove and haunted him. Despite his brilliance, he had been tagged with the nickname, ""Spooky Mulder"" because of his belief that we were not alone.His sucess had drawn attention from those within the circles of power trying to keep hidden the truth, so Agent Dana Scully, a beautiful and bright F.B.I. operative who was also a doctor, believing that science was the key to explaining what could not be explained, was sent to be his partner, and keep an eye on Mulder. What happened, however, was quite the opposite, as Scully became Mulder's champion, and buffer between his obsession and the powers lurking in dark corridors attempting to keep the truth just out of his grasp.The show wasn't just about U.F.O.'s, or even simply the paranormal. It was an incredibly involving, complicated, and mature study of two people who formed a bond so deep that each found themselves unable to work or live as they wanted without each other. It never moved in the direction of a physical relationship, but something much deeper. Perhaps it is that maturity which Carter instilled in the story arc which made it so darkly romantic. Viewers knew that they belonged together, and probably would be someday, but not yet.Each episode was exciting and so interesting that it made everything else on television seem boring. Muldor found a contact within the dark circles of power who came to be known as ""Deep Throat."" But when he got too close, it was Scully who would risk everything to save him in ""The Erlenmeyer Flask."" Mulder and Scully would tackle native legends, downed U.F.O.'s, murderous cults who themselves might not be from earth, even a couple of young innocent twins who might be part of an experiment gone chillingly wrong.Always smart, humorous, and fascinating, season one set the tone for the entire series, and raised the bar for television drama for years to come. No one who loved this series will ever forget phrases such as ""trust no one"" or ""purity control."" Beautifully packaged, this boxed set contains six discs in three slip cases. The episodes which made us life-long fans of Mulder and Scully are as follows:Pilot Episode--Deep Throat--Squeeze--Conduit--The Jersey Devil--Shadows--Ghost in the Machine--Ice--Space--Fallen Angel--Eve--Fire--Beyond the Sea--Gender Bender--Lazarus--Young at Heart--E.B.E.--Miracle Man--Shapes--Darkness Falls--Tooms (Squeeze Part II)--Born Again--Roland--The Erlenmeyer FlaskThis was fantastic television, which would eventually find its way to the big screen. We can only hope that Duchovny, Anderson, and Carter will give us more somewhere down the line. The X-Files was one of the finest shows we ever had, and it reminded us what the medium is capable of, yet rarely reaches. Muldor and Scully were one of the great couples in television history, and Carter's creation may well be something so fascinating, so well-written, and so involving, we may never see anything like it ever again.",5,When Staying Home on Friday Nights was Cool,1200268800,"01 14, 2008",2008,4044,"['finely', 'crafted', 'involving', 'series', 'created', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'kept', 'intelligent', 'people', 'home', 'Friday', 'nights', 'watch', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'Dana', 'Scully', 'investigate', 'strange', 'paranormal', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'became', 'two', 'F.B.I', 'respectable', 'TV', 'viewer', 'could', 'live', 'Right', 'start', 'set', 'arc', 'entire', 'series', 'watched', 'awe', 'Carter', 'fine', 'group', 'writers', 'turned', 'television', 'something', 'new.Mulder', 'was', 'Oxford', 'educated', 'profiler', 'such', 'great', 'success', 'rate', 'allowed', 'indulge', 'when', 'latched', 'buried', 'boxes', 'case', 'files', 'dating', 'back', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'called', 'X-Files', 'were', 'cases', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'explained', 'solved', 'normal', 'investigative', 'methods', 'Mulder', 'however', 'could', 'solve', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'reason', 'Mulder', 'believed', 'was', 'story', 'arc', 'insatiable', 'need', 'discover', 'truth', 'what', 'government', 'knew', 'alien', 'abduction', 'Muldor', 'young', 'boy', 'had', 'been', 'unable', 'save', 'younger', 'sister', 'Samantha', 'night', 'was', 'taken', 'drove', 'haunted', 'brilliance', 'had', 'been', 'tagged', 'nickname', 'Spooky', 'Mulder', 'belief', 'were', 'not', 'alone.His', 'sucess', 'had', 'drawn', 'attention', 'circles', 'power', 'trying', 'keep', 'truth', 'so', 'Agent', 'Dana', 'Scully', 'beautiful', 'bright', 'F.B.I', 'operative', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'doctor', 'believing', 'science', 'was', 'key', 'explaining', 'what', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'explained', 'was', 'sent', 'be', 'partner', 'keep', 'eye', 'Mulder', 'What', 'happened', 'however', 'was', 'quite', 'opposite', 'Scully', 'became', 'Mulder', 'champion', 'buffer', 'obsession', 'powers', 'lurking', 'dark', 'corridors', 'attempting', 'keep', 'truth', 'just', 'grasp.The', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'U.F.O', 'even', 'simply', 'paranormal', 'was', 'incredibly', 'involving', 'complicated', 'mature', 'study', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'formed', 'bond', 'so', 'deep', 'found', 'unable', 'work', 'live', 'wanted', 'other', 'never', 'moved', 'direction', 'physical', 'relationship', 'something', 'much', 'deeper', 'Perhaps', 'maturity', 'Carter', 'instilled', 'story', 'arc', 'made', 'so', 'darkly', 'romantic', 'Viewers', 'knew', 'belonged', 'together', 'probably', 'would', 'be', 'someday', 'not', 'yet.Each', 'episode', 'was', 'exciting', 'so', 'interesting', 'made', 'everything', 'else', 'television', 'seem', 'boring', 'Muldor', 'found', 'contact', 'dark', 'circles', 'power', 'who', 'came', 'be', 'known', 'Deep', 'Throat', 'when', 'got', 'too', 'close', 'was', 'Scully', 'who', 'would', 'risk', 'everything', 'save', 'Erlenmeyer', 'Flask', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'would', 'tackle', 'native', 'legends', 'downed', 'U.F.O', 'murderous', 'cults', 'who', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'earth', 'even', 'couple', 'young', 'innocent', 'twins', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'part', 'experiment', 'gone', 'chillingly', 'wrong.Always', 'smart', 'humorous', 'fascinating', 'season', 'one', 'set', 'tone', 'entire', 'series', 'raised', 'bar', 'television', 'drama', 'years', 'come', 'one', 'who', 'loved', 'series', 'will', 'ever', 'forget', 'phrases', 'such', 'trust', 'one', 'purity', 'control', 'Beautifully', 'packaged', 'boxed', 'set', 'contains', 'six', 'discs', 'three', 'slip', 'cases', 'episodes', 'made', 'life-long', 'fans', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'are', 'Pilot', 'Episode', 'Deep', 'Throat', 'Squeeze', 'Conduit', 'Jersey', 'Devil', 'Shadows', 'Ghost', 'Machine', 'Ice', 'Space', 'Fallen', 'Angel', 'Eve', 'Fire', 'Sea', 'Gender', 'Bender', 'Lazarus', 'Young', 'Heart', 'E.B.E.', 'Miracle', 'Man', 'Shapes', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'Tooms', 'Squeeze', 'Part', 'II', 'Born', 'Again', 'Roland', 'Erlenmeyer', 'FlaskThis', 'was', 'fantastic', 'television', 'would', 'eventually', 'find', 'way', 'big', 'screen', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'Duchovny', 'Anderson', 'Carter', 'will', 'give', 'more', 'somewhere', 'line', 'X-Files', 'was', 'one', 'finest', 'ever', 'had', 'reminded', 'what', 'medium', 'capable', 'rarely', 'Muldor', 'Scully', 'were', 'one', 'great', 'couples', 'television', 'history', 'Carter', 'creation', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'something', 'so', 'fascinating', 'so', 'well-written', 'so', 'involving', 'may', 'never', 'see', 'anything', 'ever', 'again']",The X-Files - The Complete First Season

Premiering in the Fall of 1993 on the Fox Network, home of popular programs such as The Simpsons (1989) and King Of The Hill (1997), The X-Files created an entire fictional world of conspiracies and secret organizations, building a legion of fanatic followers as devoted to the series as Trekkies are to Star Trek. Creator Cris Carter, a former writer for numerous TV shows in the late-80s/early-90s - The Nanny (1993) is one example - brings together the finest aspects of suspense-laden spy novels and alien science fiction. The result is one of the top sci-fi franchises ever produced, spawning its own line of merchandise and even a full length feature film - The X-Files: Fight The Future (1998). With nine successful seasons to its credit, The X-Files is one of the longest-running sci-fi series in television history...The X-Files follows the exploits of four FBI agents assigned to investigate a series of unsolved and mysterious cases known only as ""The X-Files"". FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), John Doggett (Robert Patrick), and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) are the primary agents investigating these unusual cases which could never be solved by conventional investigatory methods. But Mulder and Scully in particular play prominent roles in the series. The partnership and friendship the two develop during the course of the series sets the tone for their investigations into the paranormal with Scully, a medical doctor, playing the skeptic to Mulder's deeply held beliefs in widespread government conspiracies and alien abductions. Through the course of the series, The X-Files covers a wide-range of frightening and mysterious subjects from killer insects and secret world government organizations to the colonization of Earth by parasitic aliens. In so doing, it adds its own unique brand of humor and an original blend of creativity that fans of the genre will certainly appreciate...The X-Files (Season 1) DVD features a number of suspense riddled episodes including the series premiere in which FBI Special Agent Dana Scully is first paired with Agent Fox Mulder to help in his work on a special project known as ""The X-Files"". While Mulder is a true believer in alien abductions and other abnormal happenings, Scully is a skeptic who studies the clues with a rational eye. For their first case, the two agents travel to Oregon where they study the cases of several murdered high school classmates who Mulder believes share the common bond of having been abducted by aliens... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Deep Throat"" in which Mulder has his initial contact with a mysterious informant named ""Deep Throat"" (a recurring character) who reveals his knowledge of the truth behind many X-File cases, and ""Miracle Man"" in which a man harboring the ability to heal people by touching them becomes uneasy when several such people die after being healed...Below

While Agent Mulder has a keen investigative mind, he also believes in paranormal phenomenon and U.F.O.'s, and the Department brass suspect that his questionable investigations will only embarass the Bureau.  What no one suspects is that the skeptical Scully will become Mulder's staunchest ally.  The first season of The X-Files, while uneven, perfectly showcases the potent energy of the pop culture juggernaut to come.  The classic episodes balance between alien agenda conspiracy (""Deep Throat"", ""Fallen Angel"", etc.) and monster-of-the-week creepiness (""Squeeze"", ""Tooms"", and ""Ice"") while the less successful ones (""Shadows"", ""Space"") still showcase the concept's potential quite nicely.

For the most part, I never missed an episode of the entire series. And when I did miss it, I'd catch it some other time on a re-run or something.When they started re-running them on the FX channel, I decided to tape every episode they aired, since they were aired in order. Then, once I got caught up with where they were at on FOX, I started taping those every Sunday night. I have every episode on tape, and every DVD set that's available.This season was great. It was designed to stand on its own, since the series' future was uncertain at the time. But it had such great writing that the alien mythology stories could still be taken to another level if future seasons were to happen. And boy did they ever!

I bought it as soon as I knew it was available, with all the complications for a person who (back then) has no internet and lives in a country like Colombia (I ended up paying about 200 dolars for it). What I saw when I opened the box was a beautifuly made product. I was with a cousin who just said: ""that is just beautiful"". Then I started watching the episodes in order and I was stroke by the quality of the image. I watched the entire season in three days and I pretty much liked it. There are some stinking ones (like the infamous Space, The Jersey Devil, Fire, Roland and Born Again)... but I discovered some great ones like Ice, Beyond The sea (the best of the season if you ask me), Conduit, E.B.E... and well, I already knew how good The Erlenmeyer Flask, Deep Throat, Squeeze, Tooms and the Pilot were (although the last one I had only seen harshly cut by the FOX (latina) network in order to fit in the one hour schedule). There is no mythology per se in this season, but the UFO and extraterrestrial related episodes work pretty good as standalones. Then there is the season ender which is one of the best ever for the series... Actually this episode gives birth to the mythology.The extras are good.

Mulder is an intuitive genius with a passionate belief in the existence of aliens and the paranormal, fueled by the abduction of his sister when he was nine years old.  Scully is a medical doctor, equally brilliant but rational and skeptical, unwilling to believe in anything outside the bounds of known science.  Their relationship, antagonistic but respectful and laced with sexual tension, provides the anchor for one of the best television series ever produced.These episodes just get things rolling.  They are self-contained whereas later seasons will develop a complex (too much so, actually) mythology.  We are briefly introduced to the Smoking Man (William B. Davis), Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and the Lone Gunmen (Tom Braidwood, Bruce Harwood and Dean Haglund), who comprise a major part of the rich supporting cast that will develop.  Stand-out episodes here include ""Beyond the Sea"" (a serial killer channels Scully's recently deceased father), ""Ice"" (a deadly parasite infests an Arctic research station), ""Fallen Angel"" (Mulder races a secret UFO retrieval team to contact a downed alien), ""Squeeze/Tooms"" (Doug Hutchinson gives a brilliantly creepy performance as a dangerous mutant), and ""The Erlenmeyer Flask"" (which sets in motion the alien conspiracy subplot)./",4,The best was yet to come,1096243200,"09 27, 2004",2004,1459,"['first', 'season', 'introduces', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'Dana', 'Scully', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'pair', 'FBI', 'agents', 'who', 'specialize', 'cases', 'defy', 'conventional', 'understanding', 'Mulder', 'intuitive', 'genius', 'passionate', 'belief', 'existence', 'aliens', 'paranormal', 'fueled', 'abduction', 'sister', 'when', 'was', 'nine', 'years', 'old', 'Scully', 'medical', 'doctor', 'equally', 'brilliant', 'rational', 'skeptical', 'unwilling', 'believe', 'anything', 'bounds', 'known', 'science', 'relationship', 'antagonistic', 'respectful', 'laced', 'sexual', 'tension', 'anchor', 'one', 'best', 'television', 'series', 'ever', 'produced.These', 'episodes', 'just', 'get', 'things', 'rolling', 'are', 'self-contained', 'whereas', 'later', 'seasons', 'will', 'develop', 'complex', 'too', 'much', 'so', 'actually', 'mythology', 'are', 'briefly', 'introduced', 'Smoking', 'Man', 'William', 'B.', 'Davis', 'Skinner', 'Mitch', 'Pileggi', 'Lone', 'Gunmen', 'Tom', 'Braidwood', 'Bruce', 'Harwood', 'Dean', 'Haglund', 'who', 'comprise', 'major', 'part', 'rich', 'supporting', 'cast', 'will', 'develop', 'Stand-out', 'here', 'include', 'Sea', 'serial', 'killer', 'channels', 'Scully', 'recently', 'deceased', 'father', 'Ice', 'deadly', 'parasite', 'infests', 'Arctic', 'research', 'station', 'Fallen', 'Angel', 'Mulder', 'secret', 'UFO', 'retrieval', 'team', 'contact', 'downed', 'alien', 'Squeeze/Tooms', 'Doug', 'Hutchinson', 'brilliantly', 'creepy', 'performance', 'dangerous', 'mutant', 'Erlenmeyer', 'Flask', 'motion', 'alien', 'conspiracy', 'subplot', './']",The X-Files - The Complete First Season

The Fox network differentiated itself from the Big 3 by trying new things and pushing the envelope of convention, and the X-Files, along with The Simpsons and Married With Children, made the Fox network a great alternative to Murder She Wrote, The Cosby Show etc. The X-Files was the most creative show on TV in the 90's and if you found the show late in it's run, or if you have only caught the odd rerun here or there, do yourself a favor and pick up this box set, you will get hooked, and you will want to see where Chris Carter takes you. I haven't seen some of these eps since they first ran, ""Ice"" was great and still packs a good jolt or two. The two best shows of the season deal with the character Toombs, one of the scariest villains to ever grace the small screen. I also got a kick out of the forced partnership between Fox and Scully, and how they grow to develop a respect for eachother as the series progresses. There are a couple clunker episoded here, ""Space"" comes to mind, but overall the shows are really enjoyable, and will stand up to multiple viewings.

546407,A2996RENU49PUJ,B00003RQND,Des Hume,"[2, 2]","The X-Files will go down as one of the most important television shows in history.  There are many reasons for this sucsess.  One is because of the pivitol relationship between Mulder and Scully, another reason is because of its brillant plot, and the final reason is the wondrous writing.Fox Mulder and Dana Scully are probably the most famous twosome not to be in an intimate relationship.  Although they would develop that kind of a relationship in future seasons, for right know they are just ""friends"".  David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson deserved Emmys for this season (they didn't even get a nomination!)  Scully and Mulder had very different mindsets.  Scully always believed there was a scientific way of explaining everything, while Mulder believed that there was a connection to the supernatural or extra-terrestrial life.  This was very important to the way the show works.  Science Vs. Faith was probably the most important theme to the series as a whole.  One of the most interesting things about the show is its powerful plot.Plot is very important to the X-Files.  There was a main plotline going through the whole season that dealt with Deep Throat, an imformant who is shrouded in mystery, and the cases he gave Mulder to investigate.  Most of the standout episodes were related to this plotline.  Be prepared for a twist in the final episode, The Erlenmeyer Flask, resolving a little bit of this appealing plotline.  The other plots would usually revolve around one episode, with Mulder and Scully investigating a mysterious occurance that would be partially resolved by the end of the episode.  The writng for this show is some of the finest ever written.Writing is an important component to what makes the X Files better then average.  This show has some exemplory writers, including the magical Glen Morgan and James Wong, who always pair up to write episodes.  Chris Carter, the show's creator, also writes some vivacious episodes, including my personal favorite, ""Darkness Falls"", in which Mulder and Scully investigate the disapperance of severel loggers.  The writing makes the show faster then an ostrich.  The X Files is one of the truly great television shows.The X Files was not a huge sucsess when it was first on the air.  However, it soon became a worldwide phenomennon.  The reasons for this is its excellent cast, its superb plots, and its marvolous writing.  As you can see, the X Files had a amazing first season.  The question is, can the X Files have an even better second season?",5,An Exilirating First Season!,1205798400,"03 18, 2008",2008,2520,"['X-Files', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'television', 'shows', 'history', 'are', 'many', 'reasons', 'sucsess', 'One', 'pivitol', 'relationship', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'reason', 'brillant', 'plot', 'final', 'reason', 'wondrous', 'writing.Fox', 'Mulder', 'Dana', 'Scully', 'are', 'probably', 'most', 'famous', 'twosome', 'not', 'be', 'intimate', 'relationship', 'would', 'develop', 'kind', 'relationship', 'future', 'seasons', 'right', 'know', 'are', 'just', 'friends', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'deserved', 'Emmys', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'nomination', 'Scully', 'Mulder', 'had', 'very', 'different', 'mindsets', 'Scully', 'always', 'believed', 'was', 'scientific', 'way', 'explaining', 'everything', 'Mulder', 'believed', 'was', 'connection', 'supernatural', 'extra-terrestrial', 'life', 'was', 'very', 'important', 'way', 'show', 'Science', 'Vs', 'Faith', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'important', 'theme', 'series', 'whole', 'One', 'most', 'interesting', 'things', 'show', 'powerful', 'plot.Plot', 'very', 'important', 'X-Files', 'was', 'main', 'plotline', 'going', 'whole', 'season', 'Deep', 'Throat', 'imformant', 'who', 'shrouded', 'mystery', 'cases', 'gave', 'Mulder', 'investigate', 'Most', 'standout', 'episodes', 'were', 'related', 'plotline', 'Be', 'prepared', 'twist', 'final', 'episode', 'Erlenmeyer', 'Flask', 'resolving', 'little', 'bit', 'appealing', 'plotline', 'other', 'plots', 'would', 'usually', 'revolve', 'one', 'episode', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'investigating', 'mysterious', 'occurance', 'would', 'be', 'partially', 'resolved', 'end', 'episode', 'writng', 'show', 'finest', 'ever', 'written.Writing', 'important', 'component', 'what', 'X', 'Files', 'better', 'then', 'average', 'show', 'exemplory', 'writers', 'including', 'magical', 'Glen', 'Morgan', 'James', 'Wong', 'who', 'always', 'pair', 'up', 'write', 'episodes', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'show', 'creator', 'also', 'vivacious', 'episodes', 'including', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'investigate', 'disapperance', 'severel', 'loggers', 'writing', 'show', 'faster', 'then', 'ostrich', 'X', 'Files', 'one', 'truly', 'great', 'television', 'shows.The', 'X', 'Files', 'was', 'not', 'huge', 'sucsess', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'air', 'However', 'soon', 'became', 'worldwide', 'phenomennon', 'reasons', 'excellent', 'cast', 'superb', 'plots', 'marvolous', 'writing', 'can', 'see', 'X', 'Files', 'had', 'amazing', 'first', 'season', 'question', 'can', 'X', 'Files', 'have', 'even', 'better', 'second', 'season']",The X-Files - The Complete First Season
546408,A3FQ9WYUHG9CD,B00003RQND,"DMGenest | ""Genet""","[1, 1]","If you are choosing to watch The X-files you definitely want to start with the first season. This sets you upfor everything else that follows with regard to the re-occurring alien plot and all of its interesting characters.The show's producer, Chris Carter, credits 'The Twilight Zone' as the reason for The X-Files even being ableto get to television. Certainly the special effects are much better but the stories echo it's predecessor andthen pushes the envelope further. There is no doubt that The X-Files stands tall upon the shoulders of 'TheTwilight Zone'.There is the main plot thread of alien abduction and alleged government complicity but knowing this wouldwear thin the writers would introduce other creepy, odd, supernatural, and sometime humorous episodes.Occasionally those episodes have an ending...and sometimes they do not. Some of the episodes are leftopen to conjecture.One piece the producer did use with good effect, I think, was the voice over. This was pulled  from 'TheTwilight Zone' and used to introduce the episode, and at the end, ask more questions or to comment on thehuman condition. Or both. Sometimes it was used like Deus Ex Machina to create closure on a particularepisode.When this series was originally aired I chanced upon it and was immediately smitten with it's dark tone andnear paranoiac approach. The Dana Scully character helps keep the plots grounded since she is a physicianand supposed to be there to balance the protagonist, Fox Mulder, in his quest for the truth. This helps withthe creative tension needed to keep propelling the alien abduction plot thread as well as the other unusualand eerie episodes. Of course the two start out in the first episode with different views on their reasonfor Scully's partnering with Mulder.The sound track is done in Dolby Digital and the series done in Full Frame (1.33:1). The Dolby soundtrack has5.1 channels of discrete audio and the Surround contains up to 4 channels of encoded audio. You are alsoable to playback from your 2-channel DVD outputs as this season is compatible with the stereo and Dolby ProLogic reproduction as well. If you can envelop yourself in the soundtrack with surround things will getspookier.If you are interested, the Special Features have deleted scenes from ""Pilot"" and some special effects clipsfrom ""Fallen Angel"" episodes.Do yourself a favor and pick this season up, or stream it using Amazon Prime. I gave it Five Stars for it'screative writing, direction, art direction, and creepy quotient.

They are very well produced and keep your interest. I do have a couple of bones to pick with the production. It is taking Dana Scully a very long time to at least make a small buy-in to the mysterious, alien, things we don't understand incidents they investigate. I am pretty skeptical myself, but if I had been investigating the actual cases they had, I would cut Fox Mulder a little more slack and think, &#34;Well, maybe there is something to this.&#34;My second bone to pick is that the stories never have a conclusion. Generally, speaking they leave you wanting for some type of closure. They are well produced, but nearly all episodes left me hanging.By the way, the FBI tried to fire Mulder once, only to be stopped by someone from the senate or very high up in the food chain.

546416,AID3J6UTF6PKD,B00003RQND,"E. Hansen ""rwhwildart  & Elwyn""","[0, 0]","As one of the fan group for those who ""boldly go where no one has gone before"", I'd like to advance a plug for a series which does a fine job of going where the paranormal has ever intersected our domain, and brings it into the house just across the street, or around the corner.X-files producers consistently preserve their protagonists and often re-package and re-introduce their best antagonists, which goes a long way towards inducing a sense of viewer familiarity. The mythological and the arcane are welcome guests in the modern world of paranormal investigators Spec. Agent Fox Mulder, and Spec. Agent Dana Scully.X-files do not presume to always conclude with a Disney Fairy Tale type happy ending.  You won't know at the beginning of the episode that you can always expect to be subjected to an autopsy, although forensic science is frequently employed.  And you can't rush to conclude that the episode will always result from or result in a tragedy.  Paranormal investigation, while often probing the unfortunate, doesn't necessarily preclude the humorous.  (Quite the contrary!)  But the unknown is ever present, from the opening credits philosophy, (The Truth is Out There) to the Ubiquitous presence of Fox Mulder's prominent UFO poster, ""I Want To Believe.""Simply for the sake of avoiding redundancy, I'd prefer to post a few comments here about the overall series in connection to the pilot episode, which purports to examine an account resembling events which actually did occur. };-)  Simply stated, the occurrence of alien-abduction is reported as an international phenomenon.  What's rather more disturbing is the discovery on video of facsimile devices, not far removed from the kind of surveillance employed by our government against citizens in general.  They often bring up devices which are proto-type-related to technology that is built into NASA exploratory vessels.  And since the NASA program receives corporate investment for research products, on top of USGovt. tax subsidy, American investors have an interest only second to the military.  You can read about advances for any orbital interplanetary device, assured that it's undergone advanced testing for military usage before it was ever approved for a space rover project.There are two episodes of Season Seven, which I would characterize as the most heart-wrenching in the series.""Sein Und Zeit"" on disc 3, and ""Closure"", also on disc 3 in sequential order.  The FBI searches for a missing child and uncovers many awful secrets.  The theme revolves around finally answering the disappearance of Mulder's sister Samantha, which has been driving him on, since her abduction at age 8.  The Old Souls, and the Songs, and the Star-light, all are reminiscent of Alfheim or the American Indian view of a bridge over the line where sky meets the earth.  You can catch a glimpse of the feelings involved by viewing that Georgia O'Keefe painting of a loose suspended ladder, seemingly floating above the desert landscape amidst an aqua cloudless sky.  The answers were meant to be, to remain elusive, because they insulate us against a truth incomprehensibly awful.In contrast, the theme that ""We Are Not Alone"" is, I think, most favorably illustrated by three episodes, the first of which concludes season 2, called: ""Anasazi""  on disc 6, and followed consecutively by two more episodes which open season 3, ""The Blessing Way"" and ""Paper Clip"" both on disc one.  I am admittedly biased towards the Navajo reservation people who assist the agents in their quest.  But the events which are precipitated by an earthquake are described in memorable (for me) terms by the Navajo Elder, as he warns his grandson to leave the snakes alone, ""they will be angry, and frightened.""  But, of course, Mulder can't leave the 'snakes' alone.  I only mention said episodes by name, because Amazon features each episode as available Video on Demand.  That's all new to me.

It would be two more years before the series would reach its leafy pinnacle of creativity, and become one of the defining television shows of the '90s. Yet even this early on the brilliance and potential shines through.Unlike the later seasons (6-9), Season 1 has an excellent episode every-other entry. The highlights include &quot;Ice&quot; (1x07), &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot; (1x12), &quot;E.B.E.&quot; (1x16), &quot;Darkness Falls&quot; (1x19) and &quot;The Erlenmeyer Flask&quot; (1x23). Honorable mention should be given to the &quot;Pilot&quot; (1x00), &quot;Deep Throat&quot; (1x01), &quot;Squeeze&quot; (1x02), &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot; (1x06), &quot;Eve&quot; (1x10) and &quot;Young At Heart&quot; (1x15).In contrast to the last seasons of the X-Files, the pilot episode is hilarious due to the awkward -- yet budding -- chemistry between the dyadic stars, the unperfected special effects and the outdated haircuts. Gillian Anderson has a hairstyle intentionally reminiscent of Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling from &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1991). Her voice is also somewhat unmodulated. On the other hand, David Duchovny, whose wooden minimum acting style approach in later seasons became legendary, emotes normally in this season; thus, appearing as if he is &quot;over&quot;-acting.In pr&eacute;cis, Season 1 is outstanding in spite of its unconscious flaws and is a worthy addition to the collection of any fan or, indeed, the casual viewer.

Then it revealed government secrets, physcopaths, serial killers and aliens. Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, two characters that were one of the most recognizable faces on tv. It did well for the Fox networks and was just a new show to really watch out for.

Mulder as the believer of paranormal, and Scully as the scientist, they are the perfect partners, and the best of friends. In this series alone, they encounter mutants, ghost protectors, re-incarnation, government secrets, alien UFOs and many miracles, as well as Scully going through a family death.David Duchovny brings a wonderful humour to Mulder and plays him very well, maing you like him instantly, and with his ideas, it makes you think that maybe he is right about the paranormal.Gillian Anderson is superb as Scully, the series scientist, who thinks science can prove everything, despite her theories failing you have to admire her passion for science.The extras with the DVD are brilliant, (There are so many, an extra disc is added!), I really liked the interview with Chris Carter. I thought the DVD-Rom game added at the end was good, and very intresting.I think this is a brilliant buy, and you definatly get your money's worth.

Am so impressed with producer Chris Carter as he introduces the themes of an &quot;international conspiracy&quot;, alien abductions, and the prelude to the knowdledge of the government and the aliens spawning &quot;super soliders&quot;.  The episodes introduce these themes and keep the original characters and storylines so solidly meshed throughout the first season and throughout the other seasons that this is prime viewing material.  And I love the pilot episode; the X-Files is so raw, so clever from the start that it is so much fun to sense the sexual tension of Scully and Mulder upon first siting of each other.  I love, too, that we learn the idiosyncrasies of &quot;Spooky&quot; Mulder (his nickname in the FBI), particularly his habit of eating sunflower seeds while concentrating and that he has a Ph.D. from Oxford University (his thought processes makes perfect sense now!) and how he confides to Scully about the alien abduction of his sister.In Season One, there are 24 episodes.  My favorites include: &quot;Tooms&quot;, about a very bendable 130 year old young man who resurfaces every 30 years to prey on human livers before he goes into hybernation (Tooms reappears in another episode) ; &quot;Eve,&quot; an episode about a set of sinister, ultra-intelligent and powerful female clones (and their offsprings); and &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot;, about the very playful but evil electronic machines (ATM machines, digital clocks, mail-room processors, etc.) that brainwash people into killing machines.  The episodes are so intelligent, so clever, so playful and so mysterious that you are hooked from the get-go.  And the teasing is immediate, too, as the first couple of episodes introduce the ultra mysterious and super-silent &quot;Smoking Man&quot; who is everywhere.  Who the heck is this guy and what is he up to?  Who knows.........unless you get hooked (I promise you will) and view the second season and so forth.  Very satisfied fan here.

The first season offers self-contained episodes, but also provides the recurring themes that would haunt the show throughout its long run.  Mulder and Scully not only bent gender roles but became one of the most memorable pair of television detectives because of their tight relationship. But, most important, Chris Carter maintained a clear vision throughout the episodes that tied them neatly together.On repeated views, you can see where many of the themes were drawn from.  Some are rather obvious, such as ""Ice,"" which draws from ""The Thing"" (echoing back to the original 1951 version), and introduced Felicity Huffman.  Others are more subtle, such as ""Ghost in the Machine,"" which referenced back to ""Demon Seed"" (1977) as much as it did Hal in ""2001.""  All of this showed that Carter had just as much interest in classic movies as he did in conspiracy theories.Although it is hard to figure out these fluctuating prices.  One day you can get the newly packaged series for around $40 per season, the next day it shoots up to nearly $90.

One could forgive the writers for being a little rough around the edges however the end result is one of the most impressive first seasons of any TV-series.I won't go into an episode summary as other reviewers have done a good job of that however I will state that the episodes ""Ice"", ""Beyond The Sea"", ""Fallen Angel"" & ""Darkness Falls"" were outstanding and really captured the moody, atmospheric feel of the series so evident in later seasons.  Both DD and GA give good performances with the limited material they had to work with and end up making poor episodes look watchable due to their outstanding on-screen chemistry.The one thing about the X-files that has intrigued me the most is how unpredictable most of the episodes are - right up until the very end.  This helps to make the series a classic - one which can be enjoyed many times over.As to the DVDs themselves.  All 7 discs are nicely presented in an attractive box with a booklet explaining the listed episodes and disc numbers.  Image quality is good and is of course in standard 4:3 aspect ratio.  Sound is straight dolby surround with no use of the subwoofer.An excellent buy for those who enjoy paranormal/conspiracy-related mateial and also those who appreciate great character interaction.",5,Excellent introduction to a groundbreaking series,1110585600,"03 12, 2005",2005,1390,"['first', 'Season', 'X-files', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'terms', 'overall', 'quality', 'inconsistencies', 'story', 'telling', 'One', 'could', 'forgive', 'writers', 'being', 'little', 'rough', 'edges', 'however', 'end', 'result', 'one', 'most', 'impressive', 'first', 'seasons', 'TV-series.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'episode', 'summary', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'however', 'will', 'state', 'episodes', 'Ice', 'Sea', 'Fallen', 'Angel', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'were', 'outstanding', 'really', 'captured', 'moody', 'atmospheric', 'feel', 'series', 'so', 'evident', 'later', 'seasons', 'DD', 'GA', 'give', 'good', 'performances', 'limited', 'material', 'had', 'work', 'end', 'up', 'making', 'poor', 'episodes', 'look', 'watchable', 'due', 'outstanding', 'on-screen', 'chemistry.The', 'one', 'thing', 'X-files', 'intrigued', 'most', 'how', 'unpredictable', 'most', 'episodes', 'are', 'right', 'up', 'very', 'end', 'make', 'series', 'classic', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'times', 'over.As', 'DVDs', '7', 'discs', 'are', 'nicely', 'presented', 'attractive', 'box', 'booklet', 'explaining', 'listed', 'episodes', 'disc', 'numbers', 'Image', 'quality', 'good', 'course', 'standard', '4:3', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'Sound', 'straight', 'dolby', 'surround', 'use', 'subwoofer.An', 'excellent', 'buy', 'who', 'enjoy', 'paranormal/conspiracy-related', 'mateial', 'also', 'who', 'appreciate', 'great', 'character', 'interaction']",The X-Files - The Complete First Season

Veyera ""Jeff Veyera""","[96, 105]","&quot;The X-Files&quot; is an excellent fit for DVD---beautifully shot, a mythology deep enough to keep teenagers buying background material, and a rabid fan following noted for their penchant to purchase anything  &quot;X&quot;.Having collected several of the collector's sets on VHS,  like many I was frustrated by the lack of completeness in each release,  with a season represented by only 25% of its episodes.  While this is  acceptable for the casual fans, it proved exruciating for the true X-phile,  as invariably favorite episodes were left out of the mix.This situation  has been rectified with the release of the entire first season of the show  on DVD in a seven-disc collection.  It is now possible to watch each  episode commercial-free and in sequence in a digital-quality medium.  In  addition, an extras disc has been added (details are listed above),  including a DVD-ROM computer game.Having completed my viewing of the  entire 1st set, several observations came to mind: - The  &quot;X-Files&quot;, almost unique in episodic television, hit the airwaves  fully-formed.  There is precious little difference in tone or execution  between the pilot and subsequent episodes.  - Whereas some of the 3rd and  4th season episodes saw a noticeable decline in quality (due to the loss of  key writers and Chris Carter's focus elsewhere), the 1st season episodes  are generally superbly-written.Unfortunately, my cut of this  collection did suffer from noticeable editing problems.

This DVD set appealed to me because I thought it would be interesting to follow the development of the show and its characters during  its first year, and because I was curious to see how a television series  would look and sound in the DVD format.I could not be more pleased on  either count.  The program content is uniformly outstanding, thanks to  consistently fine performances by David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson,  intriguing scripts, great visual effects, clever editing, and of course  Mark Snow's brilliant musical score.  There were episodes I especially  enjoyed (&quot;Eve&quot;, &quot;Darkness Falls&quot;, &quot;Shapes&quot;,  &quot;Tooms&quot;), but that's simply a matter of personal taste; in fact,  each of the 24 segments offered its own distinctive pleasures.The DVD  presentation is consistently outstanding, with sharp, crisp visuals and  clean sound.  What a pleasure to enjoy the stories without commercial  interruptions, breaking news pre-emptions, and/or annoying &quot;visual  noise&quot; like station logos or weather warnings superimposed in the  corner of the screen.  The DVD extras (commentary by cast members and  creator Chris Carter, promotional spots, etc.) are simply icing on an  already perfectly baked cake.

546462,A10872FHIJAKKD,B00003RQND,Just Bill,"[7, 7]","I'm a latecomer to The X-Files. Sure, I watched the episodes sporadically over the years, but never really became an X-Phile until the first four seasons were released on DVD.That's when I bought them all, and watched the episodes in order, from the Pilot episode in season one right through to the cliffhanger in season four.I'm amazed by how well-acted and -scripted the shows were. And how unique. And special. I wasn't a huge David Duchovny fan...until I watched him do his thing episode by episode, year after year, on DVD. Now I truly appreciate Duchovny's somewhat deadpan style of acting.Fox Mulder's (Duchovny) low-key, wry-but-witty take on life was a joy to behold. His one liners sometimes made me wince, but they showed his character's detached approach to life's often &quot;spooky&quot; surprises. Combined with his passion to find the truth (not to mention his abducted sister), these qualities made for a character unlike any other on TV.I've been watching the new (season nine) episodes of The X-Files on TV at the same time I watch (and re-watch!) the episodes from the first four seasons. There's no comparison. It's amazing how far the show has slipped. Series creator Chris Carter said when he conceived Mulder and Scully, he purposely switched the traditional roles. He wanted Mulder to be the passionate, wide-eyed believer, and Scully (the woman) to be the scientific skeptic.Well, the new episodes have flipped Carter's creative concept on its head. John Doggett's character is the skeptic. Scully is now the believer. Agent Reyes is somewhere in the middle. But without Mulder in the series, the show doesn't have the same feel. And the episodes have lost their wide-eyed (but believable) underpinnings. I mean, come on. Scully with an alien baby (or, at least, one with paranormal capabilites)! Agent Reyes wandering in limbo while Doggett tries valiantly to prevent the plug from being pulled on her! The episodes are now about the characters in the series, rather than on cases they investigate. I hate to say this, but The X-Files has become just another somewhat bland TV show. More a soap opera than a groundbreaking TV phenomenon.But not on DVD.DVDs of the first four seasons (all that are currently available as I write this) prove The X-Files began with a bang...and didn't let up for many many seasons. If you're new to The X-Files, or if you're not a big fan of season nine (the current and last), you can always return to the show's highly imaginative and unique roots with season one on DVD.Season one contains some of my favorite episodes (the Pilot, Squeeze and Deep Throat being just three of many). I know the series gelled and the actors got more comfortable with each other over time (season two and season three are extremely slick and well-done), however I get a thrill out of seeing how it all began.For fans of TV science fiction writing at its best, and those like me who enjoy watching a show's hesitant -- but brilliant -- origins, I heartily recommend the first season of The X-Files on DVD.",5,Probably my favorite season,1016409600,"03 18, 2002",2002,3045,"[""'m"", 'latecomer', 'X-Files', 'Sure', 'watched', 'episodes', 'sporadically', 'years', 'never', 'really', 'became', 'X-Phile', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'were', 'released', 'DVD.That', 'when', 'bought', 'watched', 'episodes', 'order', 'Pilot', 'episode', 'season', 'one', 'right', 'cliffhanger', 'season', 'four.I', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'how', 'well-acted', '-scripted', 'shows', 'were', 'how', 'unique', 'special', 'was', ""n't"", 'huge', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'fan', 'watched', 'do', 'thing', 'episode', 'episode', 'year', 'year', 'DVD', 'Now', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'Duchovny', 'somewhat', 'deadpan', 'style', 'acting.Fox', 'Mulder', 'Duchovny', 'low-key', 'wry-but-witty', 'take', 'life', 'was', 'joy', 'behold', 'one', 'liners', 'sometimes', 'made', 'wince', 'showed', 'character', 'detached', 'approach', 'life', 'often', 'quot', 'quot', 'surprises', 'Combined', 'passion', 'find', 'truth', 'not', 'mention', 'abducted', 'sister', 'qualities', 'made', 'character', 'other', 'TV.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'new', 'season', 'nine', 'episodes', 'X-Files', 'TV', 'same', 'time', 'watch', 're-watch', 'episodes', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'comparison', 'amazing', 'how', 'far', 'show', 'slipped', 'Series', 'creator', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'said', 'when', 'conceived', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'purposely', 'switched', 'traditional', 'roles', 'wanted', 'Mulder', 'be', 'passionate', 'wide-eyed', 'believer', 'Scully', 'woman', 'be', 'scientific', 'skeptic.Well', 'new', 'episodes', 'have', 'flipped', 'Carter', 'creative', 'concept', 'head', 'John', 'Doggett', 'character', 'skeptic', 'Scully', 'now', 'believer', 'Agent', 'Reyes', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'Mulder', 'series', 'show', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'feel', 'episodes', 'have', 'lost', 'wide-eyed', 'believable', 'underpinnings', 'mean', 'come', 'Scully', 'alien', 'baby', 'least', 'one', 'paranormal', 'capabilites', 'Agent', 'Reyes', 'wandering', 'limbo', 'Doggett', 'valiantly', 'prevent', 'plug', 'being', 'pulled', 'episodes', 'are', 'now', 'characters', 'series', 'rather', 'cases', 'investigate', 'hate', 'say', 'X-Files', 'become', 'just', 'somewhat', 'bland', 'TV', 'show', 'More', 'soap', 'opera', 'groundbreaking', 'TV', 'phenomenon.But', 'not', 'DVD.DVDs', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'are', 'currently', 'available', 'write', 'prove', 'X-Files', 'began', 'bang', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'up', 'many', 'many', 'seasons', ""'re"", 'new', 'X-Files', ""'re"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'season', 'nine', 'current', 'last', 'can', 'always', 'return', 'show', 'highly', 'imaginative', 'unique', 'roots', 'season', 'one', 'DVD.Season', 'one', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'Pilot', 'Squeeze', 'Deep', 'Throat', 'being', 'just', 'three', 'many', 'know', 'series', 'gelled', 'actors', 'got', 'more', 'comfortable', 'other', 'time', 'season', 'two', 'season', 'three', 'are', 'extremely', 'slick', 'well-done', 'however', 'get', 'thrill', 'seeing', 'how', 'began.For', 'fans', 'TV', 'science', 'fiction', 'writing', 'best', 'who', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'show', 'hesitant', 'brilliant', 'origins', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'first', 'season', 'X-Files', 'DVD']",The X-Files - The Complete First Season

546466,AU8C496DUFA0V,B00003RQND,Kari,"[2, 2]","When the original ""Pilot"" episode of  ""The X-Files"" aired back in 1993, no one would have guessed that it would grow from a little cult show that sci-fi nerds watched on weekends, to a world-wide phenomena, winning numerous awards and sky-high ratings, spawning a hit feature film and countless amounts of sought-after memorabilia, carrying strongly eight (plus?) seasons, ultimately pulling actors David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson into superstar status.  No one would have guessed that David and Gillian would appear on countless magazines, from Newsweek to TV Guide, and the show would be labeled ""Star Trek of the `90's.""  Except while ""Star Trek"" remained exclusively under the category of cult status, ""The X-Files"" is watched regularly in thousands of homes across the world, and its star actors appear on the hottest talk shows.Finally, you can own the first two complete seasons of  ""The X-Files"" on DVD.  In ""Pilot"" we're introduced to the young and intelligent Special Agent Dana Scully (Gilllian Anderson) who is newly assigned to work with Agent Fox ""Spooky"" Mulder (David Duchovny) on the X-Files Project.  Her job in the beginning is to spy on Mulder--to debunk his work, but before the end of the season, we see their relationship develop into a grudging respect and trust, and she truly becomes his partner.In the beginning, Mulder seems to live up to his nickname ""Spooky.""  He is simultaneously brilliant and passionate, yet seems to believe everything out of the realms of science, much to the frustration of his more scientifically-inclined partner.  However, in the first season, we quickly learn to trust Mulder's intuition because more often than not, his wild theories turn out to be more correct than Scully's logical rationalizations.When I bought this amazing box set, I sat down and watched every episode back-to-back.  It's interesting to be able to compare the Mulder/Scully relationship back then to the way it is presently.  In the first season, they frustrated each other.  Now, they can't seem to function without one another.  So much character development has occurred since the first season, when almost every episode was a monster-of-the-week episode.  The conspiracy or mythology arcs really didn't develop until the second season.  Also, this is back when Assistant Director Walter Skinner was just an annoying antagonist--before he became an ally to Mulder and Scully, and the Cigarette-Smoking Man was just a dark figure hovering in the background with an ever-present cloud of smoke.  Both characters, who seemed so mediocre in the beginning, have come to play such an important part in the show.This box set of DVDs is absolutely wonderful, and worth every penny.  It contains seven disks--six for the episodes and one for the special features.  The presentation is excellent, and the special features are satisfying enough.This is the ultimate must-have for any X-Phile.  I also recommend Season Two, now available on DVD as well, and from what I understand, Season Three will be available in May.Pop in a disk, sit back, and enjoy!

546467,A6TXFLRZVGAFT,B00003RQND,Karin Partsch-Teiml,"[2, 2]","I bought this box-set yesterday  {if you want to get it as cheap as I did you might have to travel to Austria where I live, but hey, you'd save 15 bucks :-)!} - and already watched the first two episodes ...It was like meeting an old friend, like the beautiful dancing queen you were dating with in high school - and know what?! She did not turn uglier than an old attic bat, but as a matter of fact she has become even more beautiful, as has this marvelous box-set of The X-Files (I).I haven't seen a X-Files episode for a long time, but not because I grew tired of watching but the television stations in my country stopped airing it - there's only one channel who plays an episode every monday (pretty modest tv presence). Nevertheless, I watched an episode a week ago and immedeately after that the Fight-the-Future-movie I already owned on VHS for a couple of years which still belonged to pre-dvd era. I always liked the X-Files and always liked Fight The Future and I suddenly realized that I wanted to have the first four seasons on dvd at least (because after the fourth or fifth season the series had to surrender to repetition and descended to a mediocre program - the episode I saw on TV before buying the box-set was ""Trevor"" from the 6. season and altough it was thrilling, it was not exactly what I used to get from a X-Files episode; so I decided to buy I-IV or V on dvd and watch the others on TV - every Monday if that's what it has to be).I had some doubts about the price first, but... for six dvds and a seventh bonus disc is not that much if you do the math. But as a lot of other people already noted, it's worth it. Every darn single cent of it.The set comes in a very fancy package - although you have to treat it carefully because it is made of very thin cartonage -, the menu design is especially pleasing. On each main menu of the six discs containing the episodes, you got 4 episodes - by choosing one of them you are allowed to enter the specific main menu for the particular episode you have chosen. There you find language selections, special features concerning the episode your watching, chapter selec and of course a play-it.Next to deleted scenes you'll find international clips in the section for the special features, but as far as I know there are only two deleted scenes and and an additional cut (but you have to keep in mind that this is a TV production and they probably did not keep much of the cut material - so this is ok, in the end, it's the x-files that matter and not the deleted scenes) - the access to the deleted scenes is unlike most of dvds produced before: when an X appears in the lower left-hand corner of the picture you have to press the enter-button and get the deleted scene, at exactly the place where it would have appeared in the series if it hadn't been deleted; when the scene is finished the episode continues.The bonus on disc #7 is fun, but as are the spec features, pretty darn modest. For a collector's edition there is not much footage, but as I said before, it is ok. I don't think there will be an Ultimate Collector's Edition or something like that in the future, because if you look at Season 2, there is more material already - because they just have more footage left than from the original season. So do not worry, I don't think we'll wake up one day in bed and realize that we spend more [money] on an incomplete edition, because there now is the UCE with tons of stuff. Fight the Future, man, yeah!The footage, although not much, is very interesting indeed. You get, like on almost every other dvd, the original television trailers from Fox - there a nice feature, but nothing of real interest. The making of is ok, like the behind-the-truth-segments which deal on things like how they got the main theme, or on the character Fox Mulder, stuff like that. I have not watched the interview with Chris Carter yet, but I am sure it will be satisfying.The picture quality is fine - it's slightly better than the TV appearance of the X-Files, but of course you will notice that it is not crystal clear like most of dvd movies are, but there is one perfectly logical reason for that matter: what you get here is the best picture a former low-budget tv series could ever accomplish. Considering these facts, picture quality is fantastic - in my own opinion, a certain ""roughness"" of the picture only adds to the mystery of the X-Files. The sound is fine too, although Digital 5.1 viewers will be disappointed: The X-Files only come in Dolby Surround 2.0 - which is absolutely fine too me.Conclusion: Good special features, very good sound & picture quality considering that this was made for TV, and 24 helluva episodes, treasured by every true fan, because although the files get better with every new episode, Season One is the true thing, the original first 24 episodes of a very cool series. The first step in a thrilling quest for the truth.Approach the truth ... it's outta there.",5,Approach The Truth,998006400,"08 17, 2001",2001,4960,"['bought', 'box-set', 'yesterday', 'want', 'get',

546469,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,B00003RQND,Kenji Fujishima,"[6, 6]","I caught up with the first season of THE X-FILES via these DVDs recently, and as ever I am struck by the freshness of the chemistry between David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson as Mulder and Scully. Even in some of the lesser filler episodes you rarely get a sense of the two phoning in their performances like they were sometimes wont to do in later seasons. Already in the ""Pilot,"" you sense these two clicking along wonderfully, and it continued on for quite a few more episodes afterwards. It's quite refreshing.Overall, this first season was quite good. Inconsistent, maybe, but that can be forgiven as creator Chris Carter was still trying to find the show's distinctive voice. It may not be quite a match for the second or third seasons, which have many great moments and episodes among them, but there are still some very entertaining and creative episodes to be found here, most of which admirably emphasize intelligent horror over hollow shock value. As for the so-called ""mythology"" episodes of the season, they are quite refreshing to watch too: episodes during a time when the mythology wasn't so convoluted and overblown, when it was all simply a matter of touching upon our embedded paranoias about extraterrestrials or our government instead of degenerating into the bloated sci-fi soap opera it was to become in later seasons. Back then, the paranoia was fun, as you can probably sense in wonderful early episodes like ""Deep Throat"" and ""E.B.E.""**********Thus, some highlights and other random comments on this first season:The first four episodes of the show really set the wheels in motion for THE X-FILES. The ""Pilot"" skillfully introduced us to our two main characters, and ""Deep Throat"" went further with themes touched upon in the previous episode (as well as introducing Mulder's first secret source in Deep Throat). ""Squeeze"" was the first ""standalone"" X-FILES mystery, and it set an early standard for creepy effectiveness and sheer creativity of concept (admit it, the idea of a genetic mutant who can squeeze through almost anything is kinda scary). And ""Conduit"" was an emotional mystery that showed us just how much Mulder's experience as a witness to his sister's abduction had truly affected him. All four were near-great episodes that set the show up quite nicely.I am going to respectfully dissent with those who bash ""Ghost in the Machine"" as one of this season's lowlights (although I won't extend the same empathy for the truly lame ""Space""). It is by no means great (it has its unintentionally funny aspects, like the computer program itself, a poor man's HAL 9000), but it's hardly as bad as others might lead you to believe. It has a good, creepy premise---in which a computer program suddenly gains human consciousness and starts trying to preserve itself---and at least it shows an attempt by the writers to craft good, intelligent horror instead of yet another sci-fi retread. I think it works, in parts.Writers Glen Morgan and James Wong really distinguished themselves in this season as the best writers on the show. Their first collaboration was the chilling ""Squeeze,"" and if their subsequent ""Shadows"" was not on the same plane (a little too soapy for my taste), they came back brilliantly with the classic ""Ice,"" which truly put Mulder and Scully's relationship to the test as a parasite threatens to destroy them both. In later episodes such as the powerful ""Beyond the Sea"" and ""E.B.E."" they showed an attention to character detail that really made their scripts stand out among the pack (although ""Tooms"" was not quite successful at matching ""Squeeze"" for creepily effective scares). With one or two exceptions, Morgan and Wong crafted episodes that were not to be missed.And of course the season finale, ""The Erlenmeyer Flask,"" which  insinuated that the government might have a bigger role in things than previously believed, and set things up nicely for a new season.**********Thus the first season of the X-FILES, not the show's greatest (the next two seasons qualify strongly for that honor), but a wonderful reminder of how new this show must have felt to many who first tuned in, if more in execution than in concept. Of course other sci-fi TV shows had shown us aliens and government conspiracies before, but never with this degree of intelligence and attention to scientific detail. This first season truly set the tone for the show that Chris Carter sustained remarkably in most of the later seasons, and for that reason alone this is the place to start if you want to get into this wonderful series.

I tuned into it when it first aired in syndication on TNT around the 4th season and didn't think too much of it at first due to the silly stand alone episodes.  I began watching it again a few months later and got caught up in it.  Subsequently I ended up buying every season and paying top dollar for each.  I was rather dismayed when the entire collection dropped dramatically in price a little more than 6 months later.  That said, I don't regret having the complete X-Files collection as part of my DVD library.  Everything about this series, from concept to elaborate sets and special effects was extraordinary.  The conspiracy story line was done well enough to cause even a skeptic to question some things. A number of the paranormal episodes were astounding while some other episodes were absolutely hysterical.  Some say it ran 2 seasons too long but the acting and scripts were even better after David Duchovny's departure. Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish's characters were a welcomed relief from the chronic tears of Gillian Anderson and morbid demeanor of David Duchovny for many fans of the show. The 2-part finale was a bit disappointing and it's difficult to tell if that was the fault of the writing team or David Duchovny's lack of interest in the project.

Not unlike other reviewers here, I didn't catch on to the show right when it began.  I kept hearing about this great show and kept hearing about it until I finally caught an episode late in the first season.  I believe the first show I watched was ""Darkness Falls.""  All I could say at that time was ""what an amazing experience, why haven't I watched this show from the beginning.""  I knew at that time that I was hooked on this show until the very last episode was aired, which I was.Normally when you watch episodic television, you may watch all the shows of a particular season and say to yourself that some of the show weren't that good.  That is not the case with ""The X-Files"" and specifically this first season.  Every episode in and of itself is pure electrifying entertainment.  There was never a show like this before its genesis and there will never be another like it.  Other shows may attempt to emulate ""The X-Files,"" but they only pale in comparison.  In this viewer's opinion, Chris Carter and his creation ranks right up there with Gene Roddenberry's ""Star Trek"" and J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Hobbit"" and ""Lord of the Rings.""  What a wonderful, scary and intriguing world he hath created.  Here is where the mythology of the show begins and they carry it through with fluidic perfection all the way through to the very last episode of the ninth season.Although the price for the DVD set's might initially seem a little steep, in truth they are a very economical purchase considering the amount of episodes and the extra features.

It's nice knowing you have every episode available to watch at any time. This set is simply superb. The entire first series of the X-Files  is spread across seven discs with a host of extras and even a couple of  DVD-ROM games for your computer.  Season One of the X-Files was probably  the best; it was a hundred times more fresh and original than some of the  trite that has been doled out in the past seasons, notable six and seven.  Every x-phile has a soft spot for Season One. It's hard to believe it is  seven years old now. These episodes were made before David Duchovny could  afford acting lessons and before the series' success forced them to dumb  down the storylines for the general viewer. If you're a serious x-phile  then you'll already own this set, but for the curious newcomer who missed  out and wants to know what all the fuss is about (where have you been?)  then this is by far the best place to start.  There is no doubt whatsoever  that the X-Files revolutionised the way TV looks and feels. This set is a  fantastic way to own 18 hours of the best television ever made. See what it  was like before everyone involved succumbed to the swinish flu of commerce.  Don't even think about complaining about the price; seven DVDs for that  price is an absolute bargain. You could never get a whole season on VHS for  that price. Picture and sound quality in this set are excellent - for those  people who have complained about it, remember that it was filmed seven  years ago on a modest budget so the picture is never going to be truly  crystal clear but it's the best you will ever see it.

It is the beginning of a strong relationship. Qualification: 8.3) Squeeze - An exotic mutant is shown, an excellent original idea. Mulder shows his first sparks of intuition and thoroughly research abilities. Qualification: 10.8) Ice - ""The Thing from another World"" (1951) and remake ""The Thing"" (1982) related. Great for people that hasn't seen any of them. Qualification: 7 if you have seen one of the original movies or 10 if you haven't.11) Eve - Government Secret & Dangerous Projects Related.

I probablly would have gotten the DVD's of The original star trek (if they even have it out) and The Next Generation, if i never even watched X-Files. Don't get me wrong, Star Trek isnt that bad.. but after watching X-Files, Star Trek seemed kinda boring afterwards. The thing that is soo different is the X-files generally stick to the storyline &amp; has more action in it.

546494,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B00003RQND,Mitch Weaver,"[3, 4]","The overall premise of The X-Files is a very simple one. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)is a long time FBI agent whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid, and he has believed in the paranormal ever since. Mulder's obsession with alien encounters and other paranormal phenomenon, has caused him to develop the nickname &quot;Spooky Mulder&quot;. He has been assigned to what the FBI refers to as &quot; X-Files&quot; that involve unsolved cases dealing with strange and unexplainable events. In order to insure this department is necessary, the FBI assigns a forensic scientist with a degree in medicine named Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson)to partner up with Mulder and keep an eye on him. Scully is highly skeptical, and believes that science can provide a logical explanation for everything. Mulder and Scully soon become an excellent team and use their different skills to solve the cases of The X-Files. As time goes on however, Scully begins to realize that her work on the X-Files is anything but logical.Up until very recently, I had never watched a single episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot;. I was always very curious though, because the show is filled with conspiracy, alien encounters, the paranormal, and the overall fight to find the truth of what's really out there. Unfortunately, I was never able to catch the show on FOX and the DVD sets were always so high in price. However, now that the prices were reduced, I decided to give the first season a shot. I was immediately blown away at how good this show turned out to be. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson brought their characters to life and made them convincing!! The special effects are great, and the show is suspenseful and creepy overall. But with how great the first season was, I could only give it 4 stars. While I was highly entertained by a majority of the episodes, there were some episodes that were just awful. In order for a season to be five stars, the season has to be top notch from beginning to end.Overall, I am glad that I finally decided to give this show a try. After watching the first season, I am definately looking forward to seeing the rest of the show. The DVD special features are great by the way. Series creator Chris Carter talks about 12 of his favorite episodes, there are behind the truth segments from FX, a featurette on season 1, etc.. With a good first season, and great special features, I highly recommend the season 1 set.A solid 4 stars...",4,A very decent start to the series,1085011200,"05 20, 2004",2004,2461,"['overall', 'premise', 'X-Files', 'very', 'simple', 'one', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'long', 'time', 'FBI', 'agent', 'sister', 'was', 'abducted', 'aliens', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'believed', 'paranormal', 'ever', 'Mulder', 'obsession', 'alien', 'encounters', 'other', 'paranormal', 'phenomenon', 'caused', 'develop', 'nickname', 'quot', 'Spooky', 'Mulder', 'quot', 'been', 'assigned', 'what', 'FBI', 'refers', 'quot', 'X-Files', 'quot', 'involve', 'unsolved', 'cases', 'dealing', 'strange', 'unexplainable', 'events', 'order', 'insure', 'department', 'necessary', 'FBI', 'forensic', 'scientist', 'degree', 'medicine', 'named', 'Dana', 'Scully', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'partner', 'up', 'Mulder', 'keep', 'eye', 'Scully', 'highly', 'skeptical', 'science', 'can', 'provide', 'logical', 'explanation', 'everything', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'soon', 'become', 'excellent', 'team', 'use', 'different', 'skills', 'solve', 'cases', 'X-Files', 'time', 'however', 'Scully', 'realize', 'work', 'X-Files', 'anything', 'logical.Up', 'very', 'recently', 'had', 'never', 'watched', 'single', 'episode', 'quot', 'X-Files', 'quot', 'was', 'always', 'very', 'curious', 'show', 'filled', 'conspiracy', 'alien', 'encounters', 'paranormal', 'overall', 'fight', 'find', 'truth', 'what', 'really', 'out', 'there', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'catch', 'show', 'FOX', 'DVD', 'sets', 'were', 'always', 'so', 'high', 'price', 'However', 'now', 'prices', 'were', 'reduced', 'decided', 'give', 'first', 'season', 'shot', 'was', 'immediately', 'blown', 'away', 'how', 'good', 'show', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'brought', 'characters', 'life', 'made', 'convincing', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'show', 'suspenseful', 'creepy', 'overall', 'how', 'great', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'could', 'only', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'was', 'highly', 'entertained', 'majority', 'episodes', 'were', 'episodes', 'were', 'just', 'awful', 'order', 'season', 'be', 'five', 'stars', 'season', 'be', 'top', 'notch', 'beginning', 'end.Overall', 'am', 'glad', 'finally', 'decided', 'give', 'show', 'try', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'am', 'definately', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'rest', 'show', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'great', 'way', 'Series', 'creator', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'talks', '12', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'are', 'truth', 'segments', 'FX', 'featurette', 'season', '1', 'etc..', 'good', 'first', 'season', 'great', 'special', 'features', 'highly', 'recommend', 'season', '1', 'set.A', 'solid', '4', 'stars']",The X-Files - The Complete First Season
546495,A3IMNZSYDOTTU6,B00003RQND,"M. Jarrett ""SoundgardenFanForLife""","[8, 9]","The first season of the show that forever changed the way we think of government and of government corruption. The X Files stands alone as one of the best sci-fi shows in television history, and the beginning season brought it to a great start. While creator Chris Carter was skeptical about how the show would pan out, it turned out to be a smash thanks to its unusual and unique themes and star-making turns from leads David Duchovny and the Gillian Anderson (who, much to my surprise, gave us a butt shot in panties in the pilot episode).The show's pilot is where you get drawn in, cornered with the depths of the unknown and the abduction of two young people by what Mulder terms are ""little green men"". Agents Fox ""Spooky"" Mulder and Dana Scully are assigned to work together on an area known as ""the x files"", a department that is assigned to work cases that prove to be beyond normal comprehension and analysis. These are cases that no ordinary law enforcement or agent could understand, and that's where Mulder's strength lies...he believes in the presence of strange and mysterious life. Scully, very much a skeptic, is assigned to Mulder to track his work and report back to her superiors. This season, like the second and third, is chock full of explosive moments, corrupt people, and mysteries that many of us in real life explore and ponder.Some of the best episodes of the season include the nailbiter season finale ""The Erlenmeyer Flask"" in which Deep Throat is killed, Scully's skepticism is radically changed, and Mulder is ever so close to solving mysteries that surround him; ""Miracle Man"", in which a healer (Sam Bairstow) is framed for murder, and is then murdered before a conspiracy is exposed; the terrific gut-wrenching two-parters ""Squeeze/Tooms"", both of which showcase a horrific centuries-old murderer who preys on victims' livers; ""Space"", in which spirits haunt the crew of a space mission; and ""Darkness Falls"", in which little green spider-like insects terrorize a population of woodsmen (did this inspire the movie of the same name? probably not).So if you have not exposed yourself to the X Files, you might want to start off with season one to get a feel of how the show works.

546498,A3CCYAQRHUTPIQ,B00003RQND,Mr. A. Pomeroy,"[6, 6]","Every episode looked like a film. The pacing was unusually slow and deliberate, the scripts were well-written and it had the air of being a show for grown-ups. Neither of the lead characters were conventionally attractive, although they quickly became icons of the infant internet. 'The X-Files' achieved the impressive feat of being a genuinely fashionable sci-fi/horror series, one which it was okay to admit liking; ten years ago, Gillian Anderson was queen of the world wide web, back when people still said 'the world wide web'. After a year or so it had penetrated popular culture, and the first four seasons were unmissable, excellent, one of the best things on television at the time and since. It declined thereafter, and ten years have passed and we're older, but it still works. The aliens haven't come out of hiding in all that time, and the extra-terrestrial government conspiracies have been replaced by more concrete, less amusing official shenanigans, but it still works.Having said that, the show didn't really get into its stride until seasons two and three. Season one is still very good, but the pacing is sometimes *too* slow, whilst the merest hint of an over-riding conspiracy renders much of the drama unsatisfyingly ambiguous. The 'story arc' eventually turned out to be as ad-hoc as the plot of 'Twin Peaks', but for a time it was gripping, and although later series also contained some one-off episodes, the sense of a grand masterplan being unveiled is missing here.Still, it looked like a film. The budget can't have been all that big, but the few effects were flawless and the chilly cinematography and locations - a mixture of bleak forests and evocations of the vast American midwest - gave it a similarly haunting look to David Lynch's aforementioned oddity.It's strange to be nostalgic for a show which was all about creeping unease, suspicion and fear and official lies, and we had different concerns in 1994 and the world was a different place. Each episode is of a consistent standard, and even when the plots are dull - I was never a fan of 'Tooms', although it was a favourite amongst followers of the show - the writing, and the performances of the lead actors remained interesting. 'Ice', the pilot, and the final episode are my personal favourites, although to an extent it's not the same experience if you don't leave a week-long gap between each episode (and notwithstanding that (a) you know how the series ended up and (b) popular culture no longer marches in step with the show).There were several imitations but even today there's nothing much like it.

Now, with the DVD release I have watched it all again and I find that the series is as enjoyable as  ever. This time its interesting to note some of the in-jokes (eg the  appearance of the name Tom Braidwood).Most people who will buy or want  to buy this DVD know what the series is about. For those who have some idea  but perhaps are not familiar with the earlier episodes - there are great  episodes and there are not so great episodes. As someone once said, X-Files  season one at its worst is better than most other series. I agree with this  and find that even the poorer episodes (Jersey Devil, for one) are quite  watchable.The entire first season is split over six discs with TV spots  etc on a seventh disk. Sadly the missing scenes turn out to be two minor  scenes, both from the pilot episode and only serve to show us what might  have been ie Scully's boyfriend.That said, the transfer is excellent and  the sound quality is magnificent. The box set is a little flimsy (mine is  already showing signs of wear and tear and that's only because I've been  watching the episodes over the period of one week)and to be honest I would  prefer the sturdy cases used for the Star Trek releases.Transfer - 5  out of 5 Extras - 3 out of 5 Packaging - 1 out of 5Still, I can't wait  for Season Two onwards to be released.",4,Back to the Beginning,959990400,"06 3, 2000",2000,1441,"['been', 'many', 'years', 'have', 'seen', 'entire', 'first', 'season', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'only', 'select', 'few', 'episodes', 'Now', 'DVD', 'release', 'have', 'watched', 'again', 'find', 'series', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'ever', 'time', 'interesting', 'note', 'in-jokes', 'eg', 'appearance', 'name', 'Tom', 'Braidwood', '.Most', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'buy', 'want', 'buy', 'DVD', 'know', 'what', 'series', 'who', 'have', 'idea', 'perhaps', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'are', 'great', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'episodes', 'someone', 'once', 'said', 'X-Files', 'season', 'one', 'worst', 'better', 'most', 'other', 'series', 'agree', 'find', 'even', 'poorer', 'episodes', 'Jersey', 'Devil', 'one', 'are', 'quite', 'watchable.The', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'split', 'six', 'discs', 'TV', 'spots', 'etc', 'seventh', 'disk', 'Sadly', 'missing', 'scenes', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'two', 'minor', 'scenes', 'pilot', 'episode', 'only', 'serve', 'show', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'ie', 'Scully', 'boyfriend.That', 'said', 'transfer', 'excellent', 'sound', 'quality', 'magnificent', 'box', 'set', 'little', 'flimsy', 'mine', 'already', 'showing', 'signs', 'wear', 'tear', 'only', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'episodes', 'period', 'one', 'week', 'be', 'honest', 'would', 'prefer', 'sturdy', 'cases', 'used', 'Star', 'Trek', 'releases.Transfer', '5', '5', 'Extras', '3', '5', 'Packaging', '1', '5Still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Season', 'Two', 'onwards', 'be', 'released']",The X-Files - The Complete First Season

Pros: Pilot (such a strange episode.  Scully taking off her robe and showing Mulder her lumps?), Squeeze/Tooms (love the M &amp; S interaction.  Some romantic inclinations between them maybe?), Ice (Great episode about worms in deep ice.  M &amp; S point a gun at eachother.

For some reason I like this episode.), Beyond the Sea (one of the best episodes ever.  Scully connects with a convicted killer who can converse with the dead.  Anderson does a great job.), and Darkness Falls (bugs that can cocoon people in the dark in the woods.  Great suspenseful episode.  Love the outdoor scenery of the forest.).  Cons: Ghost in the Machine (even the actors hate this episode.  Not very entertaining), and Space (just plain boring).  Love this season--very different.

546511,A3TD5ZIKOPE8BP,B00003RQND,Nicholas D. Gough,"[1, 1]","This series is one of the best ever produced. It quickly became not only a generally popular show, but piqued the interests of many people who have become true fans of this wonderful series. Whether or not you believe in extraterrestrials is unnecessary. The stories told in each season are compelling and the myth arc of the series is a magnet to many viewers.Each episode was produced as if it were a film. They used ideas for telling their well-written stories which lead you to believe everything is more than just a serial television program, but an expose' of factual events. In some episodes, there are a few tongue-in-cheek scenes and lines which are pulled off quite well. The acting is superb in each episode, with the main characters becoming more believable with each story.The entire 9-year series is, without a doubt, a seminal production. Homage to the creators, writers, actors, directors, producers, and every member of the crew in Vancouver and Hollywood is seen in many newer programs such as &#34;Fringe&#34;. While some people may feel it lasted too long, I see the last few years being very innovative and leading towards a continuation of the characters which never fully developed either on television or in the theaters.Fox had a chance to capitalize on the following of the many millions of fans, but procrastinated so long that when the second feature film appeared, it had no real story line which could have pulled in the series' myth arc. In doing so, an opportunity was lost and one which will likely never be recaptured. The actors are now older and while they might be interested in continuing the story on film, I cannot see Fox putting the money in-place as did others with the Star Trek series of films (an overall highly successful series). [Not that I know anything from behind the scenes, as I can assure you that I am not in the industry and do not know anything or anyone connected to the show. I am just making a logical analysis of the situation as I have followed it over the years.]Watch each episode and enjoy every aspect of this incredible series. I can assure you that while newer programs might be more of everyone's cup of tea, so to speak, anyone interested in seeing the series which was the basis for a lot of these newer programs, will not be disappointed. Look past the older cell phones, cars, etc, and dive into the stories and characters... you will have fun.

Not quite as good, but still fun, are ""Gender Bender"" guest-starring the actor who would later return as Alex Krychek, and ""Fire"" guest-starring the actor who plays Baltar's lawyer on Battlestar Galactica.

546519,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B00003RQND,OverTheMoon,"[21, 21]","The X-Files Collection is a worthy hobby and next to Star Trek is certainly one of largest of the television series DVD collections, running an extra two seasons longer than the maximum seven season Star Trek series. Although The X-Files is not the longest running television media franchise, it can boast being one of the longest running SF series airing for nine seasons between 1993 and 2002. At around 1100 minutes per box, you are looking at approx. 9 boxes with 165 hours of viewing. That is nearly 1 full week of non-stop X-Files. Very few DVD series can come even remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and you could build up the series collection in no time. By the end you will have a television paranormal anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time over the course of a year. The X-Files creator Chris Carter nails a powerful television series premise, setting up a fringe paranormal bureau of investigation that is at odds with its own department, the government, the military and just about everyone else, with the immortal tagline ""The truth is out there"". Fox ""Spooky"" Mulder (David Duchovny) is the workaholic basement-dwelling good-looking nerd with a heart of gold and a mind for the criminal macabre, all things supernatural and who runs the X-Files department. He is teamed with Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), the rational doctor turned FBI agent who is asked to write reports on the X-Files cases by her cynical boss. Most episodes play along with the theme of Mulder witnessing a paranormal event while Dana gradually arrives on the scene only after it is over, missing it all, or discovering something odd at best. This kind of regular plot occurrence bonds the characters and is what makes The X-Files so enjoyable. The inside DVD case is nothing special and even has some failings with some editions coming with a seventh bonus disc that is just sitting in a slot in a piece of card and falls out easily, bouncing around the box. However not all boxes have this bonus seventh disc item. The more important six discs with episodes are firmly in place in a plastic flip case inside a thick season box that slides into a wider cardboard presentation holder for the shelf and looks quite good. Although the inside is slightly flimsy, these DVDs are presented on the cheap and so economically The X-Files seasons are sound value for money but the presentation is nothing to brag about and when we get around to seeing what is on the discs we will not be so blown away either. There are 4 episodes per disc, and 6 discs in total for a grand total of 24 episodes. Some discs have a few deleted scenes... and that is about it. On the episode discs there are no commentaries and not much in the way of bonus material except for some international clips with Mulder and Scully speaking in Japanese for a scene. Disc 6 also appears to have some error on the menu system where if left alone it will turn black and white. It does not affect the playback on the episodes though. It is just shoddy work. They could have at least provided us with the X-Files remastered in 5:1 Dolby Digital but have instead just presented the series as it was aired in 2:1 surround. Again, everything here is on the cheap. The transfer quality however is very good for most of it. Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.The X-Files: Season one, delivers as a fine example of how such a simple premise can land like a bombshell on the international television scene. There are no real cheap budget restrictions evident either, as what is on display is mostly quality acting and storytelling using natural American environments. Most of the characters in the X-Files series are found in the pilot episode `pilot' on disc 1, however Assistant Director Walter S. Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) doesn't show up until near the end half of the Season in episode 20 - `Tooms'. Deep Throat (Jerry Hardin) does not appear in the Pilot show, but is in the first episode. `The Lone Gumen' John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood), Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard 'Ringo' Langly (Dean Haglund) appear in episode 16 - `EBE'. The Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis) makes quite a few appearances. The series gels from the word go with some enthralling SF thought and implementation. Not since Star Trek had the world seen a series like it before. Apart from a lot of episodes borrowing from films like `Wolften' and `The Thing' the X-Files was doing wholly new stuff that even movies like `Good Will Hunting' have borrowed from. Season one of the X-Files is mostly about alien abductions, government conspiracies, shape shifters, wild men, poltergeists, artificial intelligence, body snatching parasites, the face on Mars, UFO crashes, eugenics, psychics, hermaphrodites, possession, aging, faith healing, werewolves, alien insects, alien bacteria, reincarnation and alien DNA. Although many of the shows might not be completely logically and even have some serious plot holes, the general weirdness going on still makes the show one of the best ever. `EBE' is the most popular show in Season One, next to the cliff-hanger last episode `The Erlenmeyer Flask'. `Fallen Angel' is a classic UFO crash X-Files episode, `Shapes' is scary and `Darkness Falls' is a great original alien story. The bottom line for The X-Files: season one is that it is a classic. It is not necessarily the most conspiracy orientated X-Files season because it covers a lot of paranormal ground. The real bonus is seeing Mulder and Scully looking really young. What are you waiting for?

546520,A3TISHGXRLMTTV,B00003RQND,Patrick Correa,"[0, 0]","Back in the 90s, I didn't just watch cartoons.  I also enjoyed watching some of the adult shows with my elders, such as the Star Trek shows on at the time (Next Generation, Deep Space 9 & Voyager) & of course this classic.  For a while, every week I'd go over to my aunt's house next door & watch the latest X-Files with her.  I have no idea why I wanted to see it; I guess it was my love of sci-fi & UFOs & stuff, but I asked to see it with someone, & she was the only one who liked it.  So I sat down with her one night for an episode in season 3, & was hooked.  I stopped watching somewhere in season 5; I think that's when I started getting obsessed with Pokemon (I am deeply ashamed I ever liked that garbage) so I just stopped watching & forgot about it.  Recently I bought this set for $10.79, & it was very well spent.1. Pilot:  A young FBI agent is assigned watchdog duty over a fellow agent, but finds herself drawn into his investigations of paranormal & unexplained phenomena.  An above average episode that really drew me back into the series.  A-2.  Deep Throat:  A test pilot who may have been flying aircraft with alien technology disappears, & Mulder & Scully must defy their own government to find the truth.  This is my least favorite of the myth arc episodes here, but it's still a good first episode for Deep Throat, Mulder's mysterious informant.  B3.  Squeeze:  Mulder & Scully search for a humanoid killer whose savage murder spree reoccurs every 30 years.  An incredible episode, featuring one of their most memorable villains.  A+4.  Conduit:  Mulder becomes obsessed with solving a case that closely parallels an ""encounter e experienced as a child.  Now this is what I expected from the myth arc episodes.  A+5.  The Jersey Devil:  Mulder & Scully track a legendary creature that has roamed the New Jersey countryside for over 40 years.  Not what I expected, but not bad.  B+6. Shadows:  Mulder & Scully investigate the deaths of two men believed to have been killed by a psychokinetic force.  A very blah episode.  C7.  Ghost in the Machine:  On Halloween, Mulder & Scully investigate the death of a corporate executive who may have been murdered by a thinking computer.  The computer reminds me too much of HAL, but that's the only flaw in this episode, albeit a fairly big one.  I still liked it.  B8.  Ice:  Mulder & Scully are sent to investigate when a team of geophysicists, stationed at a remote Alaskan outpost, is killed by a parasitic alien life form.  Despite re-using the plot from the Thing, this is still a good episode.  B+9. Space:  When a space shuttle mission is sabotaged, Mulder suspects it may be the work of an evil extraterrestrial spirit that inhabits the body of a former Gemini astronaut.  The worst episode of the series so far.  D+10.  Fallen Angel:  The Future of the X-Files project is jeopardized after Mulder secretly infiltrates the government cover-up of a UFO crash.  I love most of the myth arc episodes, & this is no exception.  A+11. Eve:  Mulder & Scully search for 2 girls who disappeared after their fathers were murdered in an identical fashion.  This is really good.  Creepy, too.  A12.  Fire:  Mulder & Scully join forces with an inspector from Scotland Yard when a man with pyrokinetic powers stalks members of the British aristocracy.  A couple logic breaks here & there, but still a good episode, thanks to a fine villain & Mulder's old flame.  B+13.  Beyond the Sea:  Scully believes that the psychic predictions of a death row inmate are the only hope in apprehending a murder victim.  Personally, I think this fan favorite is a bit overrated.  It's still great, just not one I would put in my top 10 standalone episodes.  A14.  Gender Bender:  A religious sect member capable of changing gender becomes the prime suspect in a murder spree.  I thought this was a great, mysterious episode.  A15. Lazarus:  The consciousness of a dangerous criminal possesses an FBI agent who is also Scully's ex-boyfriend.  Reminded me too much of body swap episodes in cartoons.  C16.  Young at Heart:  A criminal believed to have died in prison years earlier wages a vendetta against Mulder.  Personally, I loved this episode.  The atmosphere, the villain, the story; I thought it was really gripping.  A+17. E.B.E.: Mulder & Scully become the focus of a misinformation campaign when they attempt to trace the government's secret transport of an alien life form.  Another great myth arc episode.  A18. Miracle Man: The agents investigate a ministry led by a man whose son possesses the power to heal & to kill with a touch of his hand.  I enjoyed this.  A19. Shapes:  The agents track a wolf-like creature linked to a Native American legend.  The twist is too easy to see coming.  C20. Darkness Falls:  A group of loggers working in a remote forest unearth thousands of deadly insect-like creatures that paralyze then cocoon their victims.  Rightfully considered one of the best non-myth arc episodes.  A+21. Tooms:  Eugene Tooms, who Mulder helped incarcerate, is released on parole.  A great sequel to my favorite episode of the season.  A+22. Born Again:  An eight-year old girl is the prime suspect in a series of bizarre, seemingly unrelated deaths.  Felt a little redundant compared to Eve, but still an above average episode.  A-23. Roland:  When top scientists at an aeronautics research lab die under mysterious circumstances, the agents suspect a mentally challenged-janitor may somehow be the culprit.  A24.  The Erlenmeyer Flask:  Deep Throat tips Mulder to a critically important case involving a missing fugitive and the cloning of extraterrestrial viruses.  An excellent finale.  A+I was so impressed I went ahead & bought the next 3 seasons at the same price.

546530,AUTZUXYPDKG8B,B00003RQND,"Red Wings 11 Cups ""Yzerfan""","[2, 3]","MORE LIKE ****1/2 STARSNOTE: This review is for the original ""thick-pak"" set.THE X-FILES Season One burst onto the scene for the burgeoning FOX network in the fall of 1993.  Powered by creator/writer (and later director) Chris Carter, the series immediately became a cult favorite, and by the end of Season One (24 episodes - incl. Pilot), word was spreading quicker than most conspiracy theories.Carter introduced the world to Fox Mulder - a tortured FBI agent, who was ostracized and ridiculed by fellow agents because of his outlandish views and investigative methods (he was, after all, known to co-workers as ""Spooky Mulder"").  Did Mulder have reason for these theories?  He claimed that when he was a kid, his sister was abducted by aliens...Keeping the scales balanced, the Bureau inserts Agent Dana Scully to work alongside Mulder, and to keep his ""crazy"" conspiracy thoughts in check by way of her traditional medical background, where EVERYTHING had a reason and was proven by medicine, math, etc; there are no ""unknowns"".Relative unknowns David Duchovney and Gillian Anderson played their roles very well, and were certainly extrememly competent actors from day one.  I note this because so many TV series' debut, and never see a season two, let alone 9; and it can be tough to take the role seriously for some actors.I'm not going to spoil anything, but the sexual tension and relationship between the new partners is great TV.  He comes from a more spiritual/metaphysical background, while Scully is pure scientist.We find out a little about each Agent as the season wears on, but heavy character development happens after season one.Chris Carter has said that he molded the show after the 1972 TV series Kolchak - The Night Stalker (one of my favorites as a youngster), and it's definitely feels like an updated/streamlined version with a hint of aliens and/or UFO backstory.The episodes are not all tainted with extraterrestrial encounters, however, and other topics include: killer computers, the afterlife, shapeshifting, dormant blood-sucking bugs, and much more.Notable guest appearances include Seth Green (Austin Powers trilogy), Donal Logue ('Blade'), Chandler's early g/f in 'Friends', and Academy Award nominee Brad Dourif (also the voice of 'Chucky').My favorite episodes from season one are:Squeeze - An AWESOME villain,Ice - Even though it totally rips off Carpenter's 'The Thing',Space - About an astronaut? Or something else?,E.B.E. - A chase for an alien artifact,Darkness Falls - What comes out when darkness blankets the land?, andThe Earlenmeyer Flask - Last episode of season one.Least favorites are:Ghost In The Machine - Great Police album, so-so episode,Fire - Just kind of boring, couldn't really get into this one,Born Again - andRoland - what makes the last two episodes tough is that they fall right before the season-ending episode.I enjoyed supporting characters Deep Throat and Scully & Mulder's boss aka Assistant Director Walter Skinner:  Mitch Pileggi (the superhuman killer in Wes Craven's 'Shocker').  Does Skinner support Mulder?  Whose side is Deep Throat on?Really the only annoying episode is Beyond The Sea, Brad Dourif seriously overacts in this one.  It feels out of place, especially since nothing is as it seems, and the catchphrases 'The Truth Is Out There' and 'Trust No One' are the backbone of the series.The audio is in 2-channel stereo (very lame); and extras include an 11-minute documentary, show overviews by Carter, deleted scenes, special effects shots, and more; plus there's a really beefy DVD-ROM section which covers all the episodes and has a cool little game which places you as an FBI agent.If you love sci-fi or horror...THIS ONE'S A NO-BRAINER!",5,A GREAT START TO ONE OF THE BEST SCI-FI/HORROR TV SERIES...EVER!,1165795200,"12 11, 2006",2006,3722,"['MORE', 'LIKE', '****1/2', 'STARSNOTE', 'review', 'original', 'thick-pak', 'set.THE', 'X-FILES', 'Season', 'One', 'burst', 'scene', 'burgeoning', 'FOX', 'network', 'fall', '1993', 'Powered', 'creator/writer', 'later', 'director', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'series', 'immediately', 'became', 'cult', 'favorite', 'end', 'Season', 'One', '24', 'episodes', 'incl', 'Pilot', 'word', 'was', 'spreading', 'quicker', 'most', 'conspiracy', 'theories.Carter', 'introduced', 'world', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'tortured', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'was', 'ostracized', 'ridiculed', 'fellow', 'agents', 'outlandish', 'views', 'investigative', 'methods', 'was', 'known', 'co-workers', 'Spooky', 'Mulder', 'Did', 'Mulder', 'have', 'reason', 'theories', 'claimed', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'sister', 'was', 'abducted', 'aliens', 'Keeping', 'scales', 'balanced', 'Bureau', 'Agent', 'Dana', 'Scully', 'work', 'alongside', 'Mulder', 'keep', 'crazy', 'conspiracy', 'thoughts', 'check', 'way', 'traditional', 'medical', 'background', 'where', 'EVERYTHING', 'had', 'reason', 'was', 'proven', 'medicine', 'math', 'etc', 'are', 'unknowns', '.Relative', 'unknowns', 'David', 'Duchovney', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'played', 'roles', 'very', 'well', 'were', 'certainly', 'extrememly', 'competent', 'actors', 'day', 'one', 'note', 'so', 'many', 'TV', 'series', 'debut', 'never', 'see', 'season', 'two', 'let', 'alone', '9', 'can', 'be', 'tough', 'take', 'role', 'seriously', 'actors.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'spoil', 'anything', 'sexual', 'tension', 'relationship', 'new', 'partners', 'great', 'TV', 'more', 'spiritual/metaphysical', 'background', 'Scully', 'pure', 'scientist.We', 'find', 'out', 'little', 'Agent', 'season', 'wears', 'heavy', 'character', 'development', 'season', 'one.Chris', 'Carter', 'said', 'molded', 'show', '1972', 'TV', 'series', 'Kolchak', 'Night', 'Stalker', 'one', 'favorites', 'youngster', 'definitely', 'feels', 'updated/streamlined', 'version', 'hint', 'aliens', 'and/or', 'UFO', 'backstory.The', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'all', 'tainted', 'extraterrestrial', 'encounters', 'however', 'other', 'topics', 'include', 'killer', 'computers', 'afterlife', 'shapeshifting', 'dormant', 'blood-sucking', 'bugs', 'much', 'more.Notable', 'guest', 'appearances', 'include', 'Seth', 'Green', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'trilogy', 'Donal', 'Logue', ""'Blade"", 'Chandler', 'early', 'g/f', ""'Friends"", 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominee', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'also', 'voice', ""'Chucky"", '.My', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'season', 'one', 'are', 'Squeeze', 'AWESOME', 'villain', 'Ice', 'Even', 'totally', 'Carpenter', ""'The"", 'Thing', 'Space', 'astronaut', 'something', 'else', 'E.B.E', 'chase', 'alien', 'artifact', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'What', 'out', 'when', 'darkness', 'land', 'Earlenmeyer', 'Flask', 'Last', 'episode', 'season', 'one.Least', 'favorites', 'are', 'Ghost', 'Machine', 'Great', 'Police', 'album', 'so-so', 'episode', 'Fire', 'Just', 'kind', 'boring', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'one', 'Born', 'Again', 'andRoland', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'tough', 'fall', 'right', 'season-ending', 'episode.I', 'enjoyed', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Deep', 'Throat', 'Scully', 'Mulder', 'boss', 'aka', 'Assistant', 'Director', 'Walter', 'Skinner', 'Mitch', 'Pileggi', 'superhuman', 'killer', 'Wes', 'Craven', ""'Shocker"", 'Does', 'Skinner', 'support', 'Mulder', 'Whose', 'side', 'Deep', 'Throat', 'Really', 'only', 'annoying', 'episode', 'Sea', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'seriously', 'one', 'place', 'especially', 'nothing', 'catchphrases', 'Truth', 'One', 'are', 'backbone', 'series.The', 'audio', '2-channel', 'stereo', 'very', 'lame', 'extras', 'include', '11-minute', 'documentary', 'show', 'overviews', 'Carter', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'special', 'effects', 'shots', 'more', 'really', 'beefy', 'DVD-ROM', 'section', 'episodes', 'cool', 'little', 'game', 'FBI', 'agent.If', 'love', 'sci-fi', 'horror', 'THIS', 'ONE', 'NO-BRAINER']",The X-Files - The Complete First Season

Geisenhof,"[0, 0]","First of all, let me preface this by saying I've never gotten over my major TV crush on Dana Scully, so consider this review extraordinarily biased.Maybe it's because I turned 20 in 1990 that the show seems visually very fresh and hardly dated at all to me(land-lines and the occasional '80's shoulder-pad holdover excepted). Funnily enough, what I used to think of as Fox's a-bit-over-the-top paranoia now seems to me straight-up Kreskin-esque prescience given the exciting surveillance state we're currently enjoying. The creepy episodes remain creepy, and I still get righteously indignant when the gubmint conspires against Mulder & Scully to repress the extraterrestrial evidence in the UFO episodes.What I'm clumsily trying to say is I am enjoying the heck out of revisiting the adventures of Scully (and Mulder), disbelief is easily suspended and I look forward to sitting down to watch as eagerly as I did 20+ years ago. The only reason I say four and not five stars is that the first half of season one I feel like they're finding their footing. Once they're really off-and-running it's five stars all the way.One last thing: Dana Scully.

If you are a big fan, it's a hoot to go back to the very beginning, particularly to watch Scully.It's amazing the character ended up working so well. At first, she was awkward and poorly dressed.  Gillian Anderson smiled more and was, frankly, a bit goofy.  Over the course of the season, she got her ""sea legs"" and it was then that the show really tightened up.  Anderson is always good, but it was obvious the writers (Chris Carter) were still figuring out where to go with her.One fascinating thing on the DVD are the deleted scenes from the first episode. SCULLY HAD A BOYFRIEND!!!  They are in two scenes together, and it's wild to imagine how different the show would have been if they'd kept that character!  The sense of isolation from the rest of the world that made the dynamic between Mulder and Scully so cool would NOT HAVE WORKED.  Mulder would have been a loner, but Scully would have had a real attachment to the outside world.  A social life.  Can you imagine??!!And the first season features the character Deep Throat too, who it's fun to look back on fondly.  Outstanding episodes include the two featuring Toombs, the guy that can stretch himself, and ICE, a personal favorite.  Yes, it's a rip-off of THE THING, but it is really well done and we finally start feeling the heat between Mulder and Scully. And if you're a fan of the ""conspiracy"" arch, then THE EHRLENMEYER FLASK (season finale) is really where it all got started.We see the beginnings of cancer man, who was actually in the first episode, but no lines.  Also the character of Skinner was still in evolution, and he is certainly a jerk in this season.There are simply lots of fun things to go back and remember. It feels like the best nostalgia...pretty amazing considering the show is not THAT old, relatively speaking.One warning:  if you buy this season, you'll want them all.

It introduced us to Mulder and Scully most importantly, we meet Mulder's first informant, the enigmatic Deep Throat, and it was the season that introduced us to the more important aspects that would be visited later on. The only problem I really have with it is that it is primarily stand alones, which isn't a bad thing, but the first season has possibly the worst X-Files episode ever made, the mind numbing bore Space.Pilot: Agent Dana Scully is assigned to work with Fox Mulder, and observe him and debunk his theories about the existence of aliens, and paranormal phenomena.Deep Throat: We meet Mulder's first informant, who sends Mulder and Scully to investigate the near death of a man, which leads them to an investigation into the government.Ice: Mulder and Scully go to Antarctica I think to investigate the mysterious deaths of four scientists.Eve: Two men on opposite sides of the U.S. are found dead with puncture wounds in their neck, not to mention their daughters are identical.E.B.E.: Deep Throat returns, this time to help Mulder find the whereabouts of a UFO, which is driving across the country to a government building. Introduction of the Lone Gunmen.Darkness Falls:Mulder and Scully investigate the deaths of 30 loggers who died an identical way to the way 30 other men died 50 years ago.Beyond The Sea: One of the best episodes of the season, and the series. Scully's father dies, Mulder and Scully visit a death row inmante Luther Lee Boggs, who claims to be physic. When he claims he can help Scully communicate with her father Scully begins to believe.The Erlenmeyer Flask: So much happens in this episode, it's hard to sum it all up! Deep Throat is back, this time helping Mulder find an alien DNA testing facility.

546537,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00003RQND,Robert Moore,"[16, 17]","Thank God!  Finally, after for several years having only the option of the very expensive original release of THE X-FILES DVD boxed sets, we have an affordable edition.  In fairness, THE X-FILES was one of the first television series to become available on DVD.  It was a moderate seller, but did not sell nearly to the same degree that most sets today do.  For instance, only a couple of years later BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER began being released in sets priced approximately half and sold quite well.  In other words, as a pioneer release there was not yet a sense both of what the demand for television shows on DVD was or what the proper pricing was.  I believe there are a very large number of X-FILES fans such as myself who have put off buying the series because of the exorbitant price.  This new release fills a major need.There are very few truly landmark series in the history of TV, but THE X-FILES is beyond debate one of them. The show had illustrious predecessors, most importantly THE TWILIGHT ZONE, in which avant-garde darling Rod Serling proved you could write brilliant stories in a genre--the supernatural--that had previously been looked down upon. THE X-FILES is THE TWILIGHT ZONE's descendent that reintroduced the supernatural to sophisticated audiences, paving the way for subsequent shows such as BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (which predated it as a movie but antedate it as television) and ANGEL.THE X-FILES is also important for making long story arcs acceptable--or, rather, a bit more acceptable--to TV execs. As a rule, TV execs hate long story arcs. It makes a show more difficult for newcomers to ""get."" I actually did not watch THE X-FILES during the nineties for this very reason. I saw a few episodes, recognized that it was a superior show, but I also had missed so many episodes that I had no handle on the greater story line. While TV execs don't care for the long story arcs, instead preferring that each episode be self-contained and completely friendly to newcomers, there is absolutely no question that long story arcs provide a superior form of entertainment. I earnestly believe that when allowed to develop long arcs, television easily surpasses movies in developing sustained narratives.Season One of THE X-FILES isn't yet the show that it would become. Instead of long story arcs, there are no story arcs. Each episode is pretty much ""the encounter of the week."" We deal with a new phenomenon, a new uniquely gifted person, a new event that demands explanation. So, there is a real sense in which the show isn't as good as it would become. Nonetheless, given the limitations of episodic television, the series manages to excel. The quality of writing, the marvelous development of lighting and atmosphere, and the consistently fine group of guest actors makes this an absolutely first rate season. The alien colonization plot that would become increasingly important in the seasons to come was barely present in Season One.  Yes, there were hints of a conspiracy, but it isn't clear that the show's creators were aware of where things were going.  As Chris Carter has acknowledged, they were making this up as they went along.And what can one say of the casting of David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson? The pair are such an iconic presence that it is simply impossible to think of the show and not think of the two, as if the two were linked to it by metaphysical necessity (like trying to imagine the original STAR TREK with someone other than William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy as Kirk and Spock). They are not merely perfect for the roles; they are essential for the roles. It is probably not amiss to say that as soon as those two were cast in the parts, the success of the show was assured. Things did get complicated near the end of Season One when Gillian Anderson learned she was pregnant.  Throughout the history of TV, series have had to decide how to cope with the pregnancies of their stars.  I LOVE LUCY made Lucy's pregnancy an integral part of the show.  SEX AND THE CITY took a hiatus during the critical part of Sarah Jessica Parker's pregnancy.  ANGEL made Cordelia Chase the carrier of a demon when Charisma Carpenter was pregnant.  As would happen later on WILL AND GRACE, it was decided to pretend that Gillian Anderson was not pregnant at all.  As a result, towards the end of the season and especially in the early parts of Season Two, filming became increasingly challenging.  One can actually play a game noting how they hide her midsection in shot after shot.  She stands behind a lot of high tables, sit behind desks, leans out of a doorway only to have her trenchcoat fall forward to hide her stomach, and otherwise makes herself hard to see.  Nonetheless, her face got fuller and fuller as time went by.  Noticeably in the famous scene in which Deep Throat is shot, her's is very clearly the face of someone who is very pregnant.The worldview of the show is interesting, and if there is an aspect of the show that I would quibble with, this is it. On the one hand the show is driven by a complete paranoia about the inner, hidden workings of government bureaucracy. Government is presented as secretive, patriarchal, all knowing, belligerent, and more than a little inhuman. On the other hand, all supernatural and alien phenomena and entities are presented as aggressive, hostile to human life, and unapproachable. The gap between Spielberg's CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and THE X-FILES couldn't be more pronounced. In Season One ""The Truth is Out There"" the intro pronounces, and what is ""out there"" ain't our friend. It has had some negative political impact as well.  My own feeling is that we need a strong central government to oppose the almost overwhelming power of large corporations.  Teddy Roosevelt became a trust buster only because he was able to expand the power of government.  In the past five years we have seen an unprecedented expansion of the prerogatives of Big Business and corporate interests.  Instead of increasing regulation and oversight of business, we see even more calls for less interference and yet more tax cuts.  Although the makers of THE X-FILES were left-leaning politically, I fear the show has help foster some attitudes that aide right wing causes.Although the show started before the advent of DVD, it is absolutely perfect for DVD viewing. THE X-FILES is an atmospheric show, and nothing could be worse for breaking the mood than a commercial. There is simply no better way to view these shows than on DVD.  And now we can all afford to buy and not merely rent them.",5,Finally!

546538,AK6DB4FVAVO3O,B00003RQND,Robert North,"[1, 1]","There's much to the X-Files that's hard to defend. Whole Web sites have been devoted to nitpicking the science. Attempts to fit the X-Files episodes into an entire Universe view creates conflicts between the earliest episodes and later ""mythology"" episodes.But forget all of that. What makes The X-Files great are the personal strengths and flaws of Mulder and Scully and their relationship. As with so many popular shows, it is hard to reproduce the magic found here, because we don't really understand how the magic works. It's human chemistry, and its science is more myth than flying saucers.To round out the picture of this special series, add some high quality photography, quirky support actors and beautiful externals. Of course, don't forget the often-inspired writing, including some very wry humor: Paraphrasing since I don't have my disks handy: ""He's a killer, and a golfer."" ""Hey, I think you drooled on me."" ""Can I get this off my hand without betraying my cool exterior."" And my favorite, from 3: ""You're really disturbing me...On multiple levels.""I could go on, but why bother. Either you're a fan or your not. Not familiar with the show? Catch it on repeats and see what you think. All that said, if you are a fan, I can't recommend the DVD collections enough. I have seasons one and two, and I have seasons three and four on my list. I may go all the way to season 6 in the end.Why spend all of the cash?1) You get every episode, with great picture and sound. Honestly, this alone makes the sets worth having2) You get the interviews with Chris Carter originally included with the videos. They're often full of behind the scenes info.3) You get the spots created for the FX reruns, including brief interviews with the actors. One of my favorites, long time cult villain Brian Thompson who plays the alien bounty hunter and comes across as a very mellow, soft-spoken guy.4) You get some deleted scenes as well.What's missing on these? Well, it looks as though season four finally adds commentary for a couple episodes. This is sorely missing from seasons one and two. In fact, if you had the VHS copies already and caught the spots on FX, you don't get that much in the way of additional extras with one and two. For instance, there is no apparent direct star involvement with these sets, such as interviews with principle actors done just for these colections. After all, extras help make spending so much worth it. It's hard to have too many.Still, those minor criticisms aside, I consider both DVD collections I own a great value. If you're a fan, you will too - especially when you're in the mood for an episode, and the World Series is on one channel, and repeats from season 8 on the other.

546544,A3F0HT2YG3X6CD,B00003RQND,"Serkan Okar ""movie and music connoisseur""","[0, 0]","X-Files is the best TV show of its kind since The Twilight Zone by Rod Serling. It is the perfect marriage of paranormal and sci-fi and is a real treasure for anyone who loves mystery, suspense and UFOs.  FBI has a secret division called ""The X-Files"" where two FBI agents, Mulder and Scully, are working together on resolving the cases that are paranormal in nature. Its central theme is government's conspiracy about aliens. The show plays around the idea that US government knows about aliens and conducts secret experiments which is a theme that rings bells with UFO enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists. Those episodes are known as ""myth"" episodes and they follow a certain timeline; in every season there are at least 3-4 mythological episodes. Because they follow a certain timeline, to make the best sense out of them, they need to be watched in order. But then there are those episodes that tells a story in one single epiode and they are called ""stand-alone"" episodes.Whether you like UFOs or paranormal, you will find something you like in every season. The one of the reason for the succcess of the show in general is the chemistry between Mulder and Scully. This is not a romantic chemistry but rather a chemistry between two professional partners who are willing and open to understanding each other, through which they develop a strong trust, friendship and loyalty. Scully has more scientific approach; she needs evidence and she needs proof. Mulder, on the other hand, believes in the existence of UFOs and things of paranormal nature. They represent two opposite views but this creates a perfect balance for the show.In Season 1, the series opening, we are introduced the characters of Mulder (Spooky Mulder) and Scully. 2nd episode on Disc 1 is Deep Throat which is the first myth episode. Some of my favorite episodes are ""Space"" (an astraunat sees a ghostly being in one of the space missions), ""Lazarus"" (has that Twilight Zone quality), ""Shapes"" (werewolf), ""Darkness Falls"". ""Ice"" reminds me of ""The Thing"" by John Carpenter. ""E.B.E"" and ""The Erlenmeyer Flask"" are two other myth episodes. ""The Erlenmeyer Flask"" is my favorite myth episode from Season 1.

546547,A3FSKY78S62AD8,B00003RQND,"Shannon OHare ""~Shannon~""","[0, 0]","This show had a running theme that the government can not be trusted and it was an on going battle between main character FBI Agent Fox Molder (David Duchovny) dealing with the strange disappearance of his sister when he was a young child who grows up believing she was abducted by aliens or is involved in some form government experiments. He teams up in the first episode with Agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) to find the truth about what happened to a boy who was in a vegetable like state at a hospital and the mysterious deaths of his classmates. The twist to Dana Scully's character is she is the complete opposite of Molder. Where he looks to the supernatural and paranormal for his answers Scully solely relies on Science and factual evidence to come to her conclusions. Even if the supernatural and paranormal is staring her in the face, she often fights the urge to believe in anything that is not science based; or in anything that does not have a rational real world explanation.I'm not going into details here and I'm not going to describe every episode in this series (lets face nine series is a lot to try and describe. There were a series of episodes that dealt with Molder (and Scully's) battle with the powerful government that tries to hide the truth from the common purpose.  Then there were &#34;monster's of the week&#34; stories that involved someone with an unusual monster like ability or some form of ghost/alien/monster like creature. I remember Season 1 Squeeze (one of my favorite shows) about a man that has to kill five people and eat their liver in order to stay alive and then hibernates for 30 something years...or the episode the Jersey Devil about a creature that comes out of the woods and eats humans to survive.Gender Bender is another good episode where they deal with someone who can change into a male or female at will and are from an -Amish like community but of course there is more science fiction to the story that just that. I just don't want to spoil it. In Darkness Falls Molder and Scully take a trip to the woods to figure out what happened to a group of missing loggers and wind up getting attacked by swarming insects and have to fight for their lives.One more episode that was probably my favorite in the Season 1 Roland, where they investigate the murder of members of a team of  jet propulsion scientists. They are led to the only logical suspect a mentally challenged man suffering from autism living in a group home who seemed to be have a strange gift with numbers.I think for the first season of a show this is by far a great opening.

Mulder believes that his sister was abducted by aliens when she was a child, and he will do everything in his power to prove that the U.S. government knows of this and is covering it up. Because of his obsession, Mulder is paired with Agent Dana Scully, a straight-laced, by-the-book agent sent to debunk his work. However, rather than spying on Mulder, Scully takes an interest in his work and they become strong partners. That is the basis for the rest of the show.In most episodes, Mulder and Scully investigate paranormal happenings that defy the laws of nature or the universe. Scully proves to be ever the skeptic she set out to be, never being convinced of Mulder's work.The real power of the show, though, comes with its ability to let the viewer feel exactly what Fox Mulder is feeling. So many times during the First Season Mulder comes agonizingly close to unearthing critical evidence against the government in his pursuit of aliens, but each and every time it is yanked away or swept under the rug. The viewers feel just as cheated as Mulder does, wanting to continue the quest for the truth.Along the way in Season One, a few key characters are introduced. The Cigarette Smoking Man makes a few minor, yet crucial, appearances, while the mysterious Deep Throat works as a trusted (?) informant to Mulder.Season One of The X-Files is quite different from all the other seasons. It has more of a darker, scarier feel to it. The ""mythology"" established in later seasons has not been developed quite yet, so it consists primarily of stand-alone episodes. A good job is done with character development, and it definetly makes one want to keep watching the show.In conclusion, Season One is a great scary, sci-fi show. Turn out the lights, turn up the TV, and enjoy!!Season Three (5 stars):The third season of the X-Files is widely regarded as the best season of the show at seamlessly showcasing the three areas in which the X-Files came to be known for:1. First, this season kept progressing the show's ""mythology"" in fascinating fashion.  From the introduction of the shadowy Syndicate (of which the Cigarette Smoking Man is a member) to the continued betrayal of Alex ""Ratboy"" Krychek, the myth-arc episodes were some of the best in the show's history.  A different interpretation of Scully's earlier abduction is also touched on, as well as a strange alien subject brought up from the depths of the ocean.2. This season also continued the high-quality ""stand-alone"" X-File case episodes.  ""Revelations"" probes the religous differences between Agents Mulder and Scully, ""Pusher"" introduces a psychologically-terrifying villain, and ""Avatar"" explores the personal life of A.D. Walter Skinner.3. Finally, three comedic episodes are featured in this season, providing a much-appreciated breath of fresh air to a show that regularly delves into some very serious content.  ""Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose"" pays tribute to the silent films of yesteryear, ""War of the Coprophages"" is full of witty Mulder-isms, and ""Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space'"" is considered the ultimate comedic X-File to this day.To conclude, the Third Season of the X-Files does a remarkable job of blending an over-arching mythology with single-hour paranormal excursions and short doses of comedy to keep things fresh.",5,The Season That Started It All (and) Hitting Its Stride,1135814400,"12 29, 2005",2005,3723,"['Due', 'Amazon', 'glitch', 'review', 'X-Files', 'Season', 'One', 'Season', 'Three', 'boxset', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'included', 'reviews', 'seasons', 'single', 'review', 'Season', 'One', '5', 'stars', 'once', 'while', 'show', 'along', 'will', 'grip', 'not', 'let', 'go', 'X-Files', 'kind', 'show.During', 'First', 'Season', 'X-Files', 'are', 'introduced', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'brilliant', 'yet', 'strange', 'F.B.I', 'investigator', 'Mulder', 'sister', 'was', 'abducted', 'aliens', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'will', 'do', 'everything', 'power', 'prove', 'U.S.', 'government', 'knows', 'covering', 'up', 'obsession', 'Mulder', 'paired', 'Agent', 'Dana', 'Scully', 'straight-laced', 'by-the-book', 'agent', 'sent', 'debunk', 'work', 'However', 'rather', 'spying', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'interest', 'work', 'become', 'strong', 'partners', 'basis', 'rest', 'show.In', 'most', 'episodes', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'investigate', 'paranormal', 'happenings', 'defy', 'laws', 'nature', 'universe', 'Scully', 'be', 'ever', 'skeptic', 'set', 'out', 'be', 'never', 'being', 'convinced', 'Mulder', 'work.The', 'real', 'power', 'show', 'ability', 'let', 'viewer', 'feel', 'exactly', 'what', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'feeling', 'So', 'many', 'times', 'First', 'Season', 'Mulder', 'agonizingly', 'close', 'unearthing', 'critical', 'evidence', 'government', 'pursuit', 'aliens', 'time', 'yanked', 'away', 'swept', 'rug', 'viewers', 'feel', 'just', 'as', 'cheated', 'Mulder', 'wanting', 'continue', 'quest', 'truth.Along', 'way', 'Season', 'One', 'few', 'key', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'Cigarette', 'Smoking', 'Man', 'few', 'minor', 'yet', 'crucial', 'appearances', 'mysterious', 'Deep', 'Throat', 'trusted', 'informant', 'Mulder.Season', 'One', 'X-Files', 'quite', 'different', 'other', 'seasons', 'more', 'darker', 'scarier', 'feel', 'mythology', 'established', 'later', 'seasons', 'not', 'been', 'developed', 'quite', 'yet', 'primarily', 'stand-alone', 'episodes', 'good', 'job', 'done', 'character', 'development', 'definetly', 'one', 'want', 'keep', 'watching', 'show.In', 'conclusion', 'Season', 'One', 'great', 'scary', 'sci-fi', 'show', 'Turn', 'out', 'lights', 'turn', 'up', 'TV', 'enjoy', 'Season', 'Three', '5', 'stars', 'third', 'season', 'X-Files', 'widely', 'regarded', 'best', 'season', 'show', 'seamlessly', 'showcasing', 'three', 'areas', 'X-Files', 'came', 'be', 'known', 'for:1', 'First', 'season', 'kept', 'progressing', 'show', 'mythology', 'fascinating', 'fashion', 'introduction', 'shadowy', 'Syndicate', 'Cigarette', 'Smoking', 'Man', 'member', 'continued', 'betrayal', 'Alex', 'Ratboy', 'Krychek', 'myth-arc', 'episodes', 'were', 'best', 'show', 'history', 'different', 'interpretation', 'Scully', 'earlier', 'abduction', 'also', 'touched', 'as', 'well', 'strange', 'alien', 'subject', 'brought', 'up', 'depths', 'ocean.2', 'season', 'also', 'continued', 'high-quality', 'stand-alone', 'X-File', 'case', 'episodes', 'Revelations', 'religous', 'differences', 'Agents', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'Pusher', 'psychologically-terrifying', 'villain', 'Avatar', 'personal', 'life', 'A.D.', 'Walter', 'Skinner.3', 'Finally', 'three', 'comedic', 'episodes', 'are', 'featured', 'season', 'providing', 'much-appreciated', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'show', 'regularly', 'delves', 'very', 'serious', 'content', 'Clyde', 'Bruckman', 'Final', 'Repose', 'tribute', 'silent', 'films', 'yesteryear', 'War', 'Coprophages', 'full', 'witty', 'Mulder-isms', 'Jose', 'Chung', ""'From"", 'Outer', 'Space', 'considered', 'ultimate', 'comedic', 'X-File', 'day.To', 'conclude', 'Third', 'Season', 'X-Files', 'remarkable', 'job', 'blending', 'over-arching', 'mythology', 'single-hour', 'paranormal', 'excursions', 'short', 'doses', 'comedy', 'keep', 'things', 'fresh']",The X-Files - The Complete First Season
546578,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00003RQND,Z Hayes,"[2, 3]","The X-Files is one of the best TV series centering around the paranormal/bizarre/UFOs/conspiracy theories out there. The pairing of skeptic Agent Dana Scully [Gillian Andersen] together with Agent Fox ""I Want to Believe"" Mulder [David Duchovny] makes one of the best pairings in TV history.The First season makes for a great introduction to the show, and there are some amazing episodes. Some of my favorites are:1.Pilot - Scully is assigned to work with Mulder, she looks for the rational & logical, he is open minded to all possibilities, both in the realm of the real and unreal. Their first assignment takes them to rural Oregon, where they investigate the strange deaths of high school students, which Mulder believes is tied in to alien abduction.3. Squeeze - one of my all-time favorite X-files episode. Scully enjoins Mulder to help her friend's investigation of a bizarre murder. Mulder finds a striking similarity between the present crime and one committed thirty years ago, by the same suspect. The suspect turns out to be a genetic mutant that needs a certain kind of nourishment to regenerate itself.11. Eve - Mulder & Scully investigate the strange deaths of two men, apparently unrelated, but then find that both men have identical eight-year-old daughters who seem 'innocent' enough.14. Genderbender - the agents investigate the murders where the perp seems to be both male & female. The trail leads to a rural Massachusetts town where a group called the Kindred seem to be involved.18. Miracle Man - the agents investigate a series of deaths that seems linked to Samuel, a faith healer.21. Tooms - the genetic mutant, Eugene Tooms is released, and Mulder takes it upon himself to see that he doesn't get away or commit another murder.23. Roland - murders among a group of scientists that seem to implicate a certain retarded janitor.I loved most of the episodes but the above were some of my personal favorites. The quality of this show is excellent on all fronts, and makes for compelling, thought-provoking viewing.",5,Great beginning to a ground-breaking series!,1184284800,"07 13, 2007",2007,2035,"['X-Files', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'series', 'centering', 'paranormal/bizarre/UFOs/conspiracy', 'out', 'there', 'pairing', 'skeptic', 'Agent', 'Dana', 'Scully', '[', 'Gillian', 'Andersen', ']', 'together', 'Agent', 'Fox', 'Want', 'Believe', 'Mulder', '[', 'David', 'Duchovny', ']', 'one', 'best', 'pairings', 'TV', 'history.The', 'First', 'season', 'great', 'introduction', 'show', 'are', 'amazing', 'episodes', 'favorites', 'are:1.Pilot', 'Scully', 'assigned', 'work', 'Mulder', 'rational', 'logical', 'open', 'minded', 'possibilities', 'realm', 'real', 'unreal', 'first', 'assignment', 'rural', 'Oregon', 'where', 'investigate', 'strange', 'deaths', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'Mulder', 'tied', 'alien', 'abduction.3', 'Squeeze', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'X-files', 'episode', 'Scully', 'Mulder', 'help', 'friend', 'investigation', 'bizarre', 'murder', 'Mulder', 'striking', 'similarity', 'present', 'crime', 'one', 'committed', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'same', 'suspect', 'suspect', 'out', 'be', 'genetic', 'mutant', 'certain', 'kind', 'nourishment', 'regenerate', 'itself.11', 'Eve', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'investigate', 'strange', 'deaths', 'two', 'men', 'apparently', 'unrelated', 'then', 'find', 'men', 'have', 'identical', 'eight-year-old', 'daughters', 'who', 'seem', ""'innocent"", 'enough.14', 'Genderbender', 'agents', 'investigate', 'murders', 'where', 'perp', 'be', 'male', 'female', 'trail', 'rural', 'Massachusetts', 'town', 'where', 'group', 'called', 'Kindred', 'seem', 'be', 'involved.18', 'Miracle', 'Man', 'agents', 'investigate', 'series', 'deaths', 'linked', 'Samuel', 'faith', 'healer.21', 'Tooms', 'genetic', 'mutant', 'Eugene', 'Tooms', 'released', 'Mulder', 'see', ""n't"", 'get', 'away', 'commit', 'murder.23', 'Roland', 'murders', 'group', 'scientists', 'seem', 'implicate', 'certain', 'retarded', 'janitor.I', 'loved', 'most', 'episodes', 'above', 'were', 'personal', 'favorites', 'quality', 'show', 'excellent', 'fronts', 'compelling', 'thought-provoking', 'viewing']",The X-Files - The Complete First Season
