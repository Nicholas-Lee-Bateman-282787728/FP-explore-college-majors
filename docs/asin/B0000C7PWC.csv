773770,A12YEK4IBI7UAL,B0000C7PWC,Zi Jones David,"[3, 5]","Justin TimberlakeJustified:  The VideosFirst of all, I am a 34-year-old mother. I just got hip to JT in October 2006 (I never paid attention to N'Sync and got it and Backstreet Boys and 98* all mixed up!) I went to JT's concert in Febuary but this DVD is kind of disappointing.People often compare Justin's moves and a few of his tones to Michael Jackson.  After all of his crazi antics, Michael Jackson is still the original King of Pop and its no wonder why. As I watched the video for ""Like I Love You"", I saw JT doing the MJ thing and doing it damned well! I say if JT is talented enough to do it, good for him. It is extreme talent.  That video is nice and satisfying.Next on the DVD is the making of the ""Like I Love You"" video. The interview with him is horrific.  He comes across as a little creep.  It is too bad that in this interview he is nothing like the well polished professional that he is today.  Throughout these interviews he tries to be the young white boy who is trying to be cool with his black homeys.  My mother often refers to JT as a ""young punk"" and if she saw this, it would confirm her thoughts.  I didn't like his attitude or his so-called black accent.The interview was boring and I finally gave in and fast-forwarded it. The ""Cry Me a River"" video is nice, too. It is simply the video. Next ""Like I Love You"" in concert. It may not be the video but its still a song already on the DVD. Okay, I like the song so I watched it. Again, is another performance of ""Like I Love You"".  I couldn't watch it for a third time!""Cry Me a River"" performed live. Okay, we just saw the video, we don't need to see this performance. It's getting a little boring now.The ""Rock Your Body"" video saves this DVD. The video uses extraordinarily unbelievable graphics and effects.  The making of this video is quite interesting as we get an explanation behind the effects. For such a multi-talented, clean-cut, people person, JT exhibits a horribly immature behavior in these interviews.I'm sorry to say that I did not even bother to watch the ""Senorita"" video or the MTV excerpts or the Brit Awards.This DVD is disappointing. JT is undoubtedly magical with his song and dance. He is very talented and he can appeal to children, teens and adults. That is intensely admirable. Although the DVD falls short compared to JT's current abilities, the ""Rock Your Body"" video and behind-the-scenes gives this DVD a spot in every fan's collection. JT has grown more professionally than I would have known if I hadn't seen this DVD.Just don't expect too much.",3,A Bit Disappointing but Deserves a Spot in your Collection,1179792000,"05 22, 2007",2007,2558,"['Justin', 'TimberlakeJustified', 'VideosFirst', 'am', '34-year-old', 'mother', 'just', 'got', 'hip', 'JT', 'October', '2006', 'never', 'paid', 'attention', ""N'Sync"", 'got', 'Backstreet', 'Boys', '98*', 'mixed', 'up', 'went', 'JT', 'concert', 'Febuary', 'DVD', 'kind', 'disappointing.People', 'often', 'Justin', 'moves', 'few', 'tones', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'crazi', 'antics', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'still', 'original', 'King', 'Pop', 'wonder', 'why', 'watched', 'video', 'Love', 'saw', 'JT', 'doing', 'MJ', 'thing', 'doing', 'damned', 'well', 'say', 'JT', 'talented', 'enough', 'do', 'good', 'extreme', 'talent', 'video', 'nice', 'satisfying.Next', 'DVD', 'making', 'Love', 'video', 'interview', 'horrific', 'across', 'little', 'creep', 'too', 'bad', 'interview', 'nothing', 'well', 'polished', 'professional', 'today', 'interviews', 'be', 'young', 'white', 'boy', 'who', 'trying', 'be', 'cool', 'black', 'homeys', 'mother', 'often', 'JT', 'young', 'punk', 'saw', 'would', 'confirm', 'thoughts', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'attitude', 'so-called', 'black', 'accent.The', 'interview', 'was', 'boring', 'finally', 'gave', 'fast-forwarded', 'Cry', 'Me', 'River', 'video', 'nice', 'too', 'simply', 'video', 'Next', 'Love', 'concert', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'video', 'still', 'song', 'already', 'DVD', 'Okay', 'like', 'song', 'so', 'watched', 'Again', 'performance', 'Love', 'could', ""n't"", 'watch', 'third', 'time', 'Cry', 'Me', 'River', 'performed', 'live', 'Okay', 'just', 'saw', 'video', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'performance', 'getting', 'little', 'boring', 'now.The', 'Rock', 'Body', 'video', 'DVD', 'video', 'extraordinarily', 'unbelievable', 'graphics', 'effects', 'making', 'video', 'quite', 'interesting', 'get', 'explanation', 'effects', 'such', 'multi-talented', 'clean-cut', 'people', 'person', 'JT', 'horribly', 'immature', 'behavior', 'interviews.I', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'bother', 'watch', 'Senorita', 'video', 'MTV', 'excerpts', 'Brit', 'Awards.This', 'DVD', 'disappointing', 'JT', 'undoubtedly', 'magical', 'song', 'dance', 'very', 'talented', 'can', 'appeal', 'children', 'teens', 'adults', 'intensely', 'admirable', 'DVD', 'short', 'compared', 'JT', 'current', 'abilities', 'Rock', 'Body', 'video', 'behind-the-scenes', 'spot', 'fan', 'collection', 'JT', 'grown', 'more', 'professionally', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'DVD.Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much']",N/A
