1114855,AB7VG07ELQ4N1,B000XS3WVI,"CrazyJaime ""Polar Bear""","[1, 5]","Please be aware this show is not appropriate for children. It's got jokes about Santa Claus having sex with Mrs. Claus. It's got almost-naked strippers shown close-up. It's got language that could get someone on Santa's naughty list. As far as the show itself goes, there are some laughs to be had although most of it is pretty tasteless. Maybe it's just me, but it seems a Christmas show ought to be cleaner?  If you want to see some really good Christmas shows, get The Office seasons 2 and 3. Each of those seasons has an excellent Christmas episode you'll probably want to watch over and over.",3,Not for kids,1197244800,"12 10, 2007",2007,597,"['Please', 'be', 'aware', 'show', 'not', 'appropriate', 'children', 'got', 'jokes', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'having', 'sex', 'Mrs.', 'Claus', 'got', 'almost-naked', 'strippers', 'shown', 'close-up', 'got', 'language', 'could', 'get', 'someone', 'Santa', 'naughty', 'list', 'As', 'far', 'show', 'are', 'laughs', 'be', 'had', 'most', 'pretty', 'tasteless', 'just', 'Christmas', 'show', 'ought', 'be', 'cleaner', 'want', 'see', 'really', 'good', 'Christmas', 'shows', 'get', 'Office', 'seasons', '2', '3', 'seasons', 'excellent', 'Christmas', 'episode', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'want', 'watch']",Larry the Cable Guy's Christmas Spectacular

Then again, not much of Larry's work is for children.With that being said, this is a funny video.  It is a take off of all the Christmas specials that were run in the 1960's, 1970's and somewhat into the 1980's.  There is some crude humor, but it was nothing more than what I have seen out of Larry before (such as The Health Inspector).It is not politically correct which is another reason I loved it.  If you can't laugh at yourself along with laughing at others, please skip this video.I have definitely bought this video, added it to my Christmas collection, and my child won't be watching it for many years to come.",5,Larry and Christmas - a bizarre combination,1211932800,"05 28, 2008",2008,667,"['First', 'off', 'DEFINITELY', 'NOT', 'FOR', 'CHILDREN', 'Then', 'again', 'not', 'much', 'Larry', 'work', 'children.With', 'being', 'said', 'funny', 'video', 'take', 'Christmas', 'specials', 'were', 'run', '1960', '1970', 'somewhat', '1980', 'crude', 'humor', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'Larry', 'such', 'Health', 'Inspector', '.It', 'not', 'politically', 'correct', 'reason', 'loved', 'ca', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'laughing', 'others', 'please', 'skip', 'video.I', 'have', 'definitely', 'bought', 'video', 'added', 'Christmas', 'collection', 'child', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'watching', 'many', 'years', 'come']",Larry the Cable Guy's Christmas Spectacular

There is a roast of Santa Claus, various comics and actors play characters like the three wise men and Lisa Lampinelli as Mrs. Claus.So this one is not for the kids.  There are many kid friendly characters that drive adults crazy so if you got a chuckle out of all those bits where adults beat up Barney the Dinosaur then you might like this.If you are an adult who gets tired of the holiday season or have Christmas burnout this could be great therapy for you.
