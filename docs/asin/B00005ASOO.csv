Drummond,"[5, 5]","I was getting tired of watching this movie probably because I didn't really like the charactor Franklin he was just getting on my nerves he just felt like bagage to the girl friend (I forget the charactors name)  I got mad when Franklin wasn't doing his part in the relationship, even if he couldn't get a job, he could have at least helped out with the baby more so the mother of the child didn't have to lose out on her dream of becoming a singer.  Perhaps if she didn't meet him she might have made it.  In all fairness to Franklin there were times when the girlfriend  provoked Franklin insecurities.  For example when he had brought tickets for a concert for them for her birthday and she traded them in for better seats.  Thats a no no you don't take a gift back in front of the person who brought you the gift, that would hurt anybody and make them feel unappreciated.All in all I thought it was a somewhat realistic story about a relationship between a man and a woman and trying to keep it togetherarguments and breakup an all.

578504,A8PP8NPRJSAKO,B00005ASOO,Brazilian Jazzaholic!,"[5, 5]","I saw ""Disappearing Acts"" a couple of times on HBO, and bought the DVD several months ago. I must admit that I was a tiny bit skeptical about whether I'd like a made-for-HBO movie. But I should have known that the ""Dream Team"" of Gina Prince-Bythewood directing and Sanaa Lathan acting, would deliver the goods. From the beginning, this movie just felt real - no glossy sets, clothes, etc. Just the genuine simplicity that you would find in the homes/lives of everywoman or everyman. This lack of unnecessary trappings allowed the characters to take the spotlight.  As usual, Sanaa Lathan lit up the screen with a natural talent and presence rarely seen in film nowadays. She demonstrated incredible acting range in this movie, conveying Zora's initial infatuation, lust, and ecstasy, which gave way to pain, frustration, hurt and, ultimately, forgiveness and self-realization. Wesley Snipes gave a surprisingly good performance as Franklin, showing why typecasting him as only an action hero would be a sheer waste of talent. While a more conventionally- handsome actor could probably have been cast as Franklin, I don't know whether he could have done the job here. Wesley has always done a superior job playing characters that are more significant by what they don't say rather than what they do. That was a good fit for the role of Franklin, with his multiple demons and insecurities. Plus, Sanaa and Wesley had a strong on-screen chemistry that made you understand why Zora and Franklin found it so difficult to let each other go. (That refrigerator love scene practically melted my TV screen!)I thought that the movie was pretty true to the book, although, naturally, there was some cinematographic license taken here and there. The movie did a fine job of getting across the book's message that although lust/passion are easy, forging a real relationship takes work and sacrifice, even if it means letting the person you love go so that they can deal with their own issues. I think that many women (and men) can relate to what it's like to get into a co-dependent relationship where both parties lose themselves to some extent (hence the title of the movie/book).The only reason ""Disappearing Acts"" is getting a 4.5 rather than a 5 is because deep down, I always wished that they could have cast an absolutely stunning black actor to play Franklin, who would have had the chemistry that Wesley had with Sanaa. That would have been a bit truer to Franklin's character as he was portrayed in the book.  But like I said, there's no guarantee that a beautiful male lead would have generated the same sort of sensuality that made this movie so riveting. Overall, this was a very good, well-acted movie, which made me want to re-read the book. Not to mention the soundtrack is on point. (Definitely get it if you are an R&B;/soul fan).",4,A pleasant surprise! 4.5 stars.,1150934400,"06 22, 2006",2006,2836,"['saw', 'Disappearing', 'Acts', 'couple', 'times', 'HBO', 'bought', 'DVD', 'several', 'months', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'tiny', 'bit', 'skeptical', ""'d"", 'like', 'made-for-HBO', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'Dream', 'Team', 'Gina', 'Prince-Bythewood', 'directing', 'Sanaa', 'Lathan', 'acting', 'would', 'deliver', 'goods', 'beginning', 'movie', 'just', 'felt', 'real', 'glossy', 'sets', 'clothes', 'etc', 'Just', 'genuine', 'simplicity', 'would', 'find', 'homes/lives', 'everywoman', 'everyman', 'lack', 'unnecessary', 'trappings', 'allowed', 'characters', 'take', 'spotlight', 'usual', 'Sanaa', 'Lathan', 'lit', 'up', 'screen', 'natural', 'talent', 'presence', 'rarely', 'seen', 'film', 'nowadays', 'demonstrated', 'incredible', 'acting', 'range', 'movie', 'conveying', 'Zora', 'initial', 'infatuation', 'lust', 'ecstasy', 'gave', 'way', 'pain', 'frustration', 'hurt', 'ultimately', 'forgiveness', 'self-realization', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'gave', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'performance', 'Franklin', 'showing', 'why', 'typecasting', 'only', 'action', 'hero', 'would', 'be', 'sheer', 'waste', 'talent', 'more', 'conventionally-', 'handsome', 'actor', 'could', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'Franklin', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'job', 'here', 'Wesley', 'always', 'done', 'superior', 'job', 'playing', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'significant', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'rather', 'what', 'do', 'was', 'good', 'fit', 'role', 'Franklin', 'multiple', 'demons', 'insecurities', 'Sanaa', 'Wesley', 'had', 'strong', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'made', 'understand', 'why', 'Zora', 'Franklin', 'found', 'so', 'difficult', 'let', 'other', 'go', 'refrigerator', 'love', 'scene', 'practically', 'melted', 'TV', 'screen', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'true', 'book', 'naturally', 'was', 'cinematographic', 'license', 'taken', 'here', 'there', 'movie', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'getting', 'book', 'message', 'lust/passion', 'are', 'easy', 'forging', 'real', 'relationship', 'work', 'sacrifice', 'even', 'letting', 'person', 'love', 'go', 'so', 'can', 'deal', 'own', 'issues', 'think', 'many', 'women', 'men', 'can', 'relate', 'what', 'get', 'co-dependent', 'relationship', 'where', 'parties', 'lose', 'extent', 'hence', 'title', 'movie/book', 'only', 'reason', 'Disappearing', 'Acts', 'getting', '4.5', 'rather', '5', 'deep', 'always', 'wished', 'could', 'have', 'cast', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'black', 'actor', 'play', 'Franklin', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'chemistry', 'Wesley', 'had', 'Sanaa', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'truer', 'Franklin', 'character', 'was', 'portrayed', 'book', 'said', 'guarantee', 'beautiful', 'male', 'lead', 'would', 'have', 'generated', 'same', 'sort', 'sensuality', 'made', 'movie', 'so', 'riveting', 'Overall', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'well-acted', 'movie', 'made', 'want', 're-read', 'book', 'Not', 'mention', 'soundtrack', 'point', 'Definitely', 'get', 'are', 'R', 'B', '/soul', 'fan']",Disappearing Acts

Nevertheless, this HBO-only special is a huge disappointment to those who have already read the book, and those who haven't read it will wonder what the big fuss was about in the first place.  Sanaa Lathan gives a reasonably solid performance as a school teacher struggling with a recording career in New York City.  She crosses paths with ruffneck Franklin Swift, who's still married to his estranged wife and is the father of two kids; this dude has more baggage than LAX airport.  Their relationship blossoms and faces its share of many hurdles, but the movie never lives up to the promise of the book.  For one, Wesley Snipes, though a very good actor in his own right, is miscast as Franklin Swift.  His performance lacks the ruggedness and street-sensibility that his role requires.  Treach or even Malik Yoba would make a better Franklin.  Plus, the movie dodges many issues that Terry McMillan's book addresses such as domestic violence and homophobia.  In the book, Franklin Swift was a vicious homophobe, who never ran out of nasty things to say about gays.  The movie had every opportunity to explore Franklin's sexual insecurities, but it ultimately cops out.

The film is an adaptation of the New York Times best-selling novel Disappearing Acts, by Terry McMillan.This was a well-written novel about self-discovery and the different observations of a relationship from a female perspective versus a male perspective.Zora Banks (Sanaa Lathan) is a musicl teacher who is an aspiring singer. Franklin Swift (Wesley Snipes) is a troubled construction worker hoping to start his own business. The two quickly fall for each other. During the course of the stormy relationship, they both struggle to maintain their personal goals.Mr. Snipes is not exactly the embodiement of the character as written in Ms. McMillian's novel. He appears too mature in age to be as naive as Franklin is written. Ms. Lathan is wonderful as Zora and this role allows her to fully utilize her acting ability.The music of Disappearing Acts marks the appearance of Melky Sedeck (the  sister and brother of Wyclef Jean). Zora's singing voice is provided by Melky Jean. Ms. Lathan does a Academy Award-worthy lip synch. The vocals smolder with a sensuality that befits the sexually charged film Disappearing Acts.Disappearing Acts is a must see movie.",4,Must SEE Disappearing Acts,1385942400,"12 2, 2013",2013,1294,"['Disappearing', 'Acts', '2000', 'romantic', 'drama', 'directed', 'Gina', 'Prince-Bythewood', 'stars', 'Sanaa', 'Lathan', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'Regina', 'Hall', 'film', 'adaptation', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'Disappearing', 'Acts', 'Terry', 'McMillan.This', 'was', 'well-written', 'novel', 'self-discovery', 'different', 'observations', 'relationship', 'female', 'perspective', 'male', 'perspective.Zora', 'Banks', 'Sanaa', 'Lathan', 'musicl', 'teacher', 'who', 'aspiring', 'singer', 'Franklin', 'Swift', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'troubled', 'construction', 'worker', 'hoping', 'start', 'own', 'business', 'two', 'quickly', 'fall', 'other', 'course', 'stormy', 'relationship', 'struggle', 'maintain', 'personal', 'goals.Mr', 'Snipes', 'not', 'exactly', 'embodiement', 'character', 'written', 'Ms.', 'McMillian', 'novel', 'too', 'mature', 'age', 'be', 'as', 'naive', 'Franklin', 'written', 'Ms.', 'Lathan', 'wonderful', 'Zora', 'role', 'fully', 'utilize', 'acting', 'ability.The', 'music', 'Disappearing', 'Acts', 'appearance', 'Melky', 'Sedeck', 'sister', 'brother', 'Wyclef', 'Jean', 'Zora', 'singing', 'voice', 'provided', 'Melky', 'Jean', 'Ms.', 'Lathan', 'Academy', 'Award-worthy', 'lip', 'synch', 'vocals', 'smolder', 'sensuality', 'sexually', 'charged', 'film', 'Disappearing', 'Acts.Disappearing', 'Acts', 'must', 'see', 'movie']",Disappearing Acts

For example, notice the romantic scenes that are dimly lit, and just like 'Love & Basketball' Gina makes sure you feel the characters one-on-one.I almost didn't get Wesley Snipes character until the very end of the film. I think women will have a hard time trying to relate to his role in the film. Sanaa's character is very easy to understand and relate to of a single woman with ambitions, dreams, and going through regular life financial struggles.Basically, the film introduces you to Zora & Franklin who fall head-over-heels for each other in a sultry, passionate love affair in the beginning. Their love builds and Franklin's B-side comes crashing in. Then he sees her B-side as well.They both have their issues. Franklin seems defeated by the time you get to the end of the movie with all of his issues, and her issues, and so forth. And they finally decide to part ways only to.......By the way, they had a baby together in the movie. The problem with their relationship is that it was one with all the bad timing but in the end...........Sanaa shines like the sun acting, and Wesley does okay acting making you think of some of his earlier works before the action films. This is like an Oxygen/Lifetime film with an HBO edge. Women will probably get lost in Wesley's character of Franklin but if you take the time he will make all the sense in the world.Zora (named after the author Zora Neale Hurston) is a versatile lady who works as a music teacher, is an aspiring singer-songwriter, and mother. The film allows you to use your own imagination to make it work in many of the scenes.In the end, I almost gave this film 3 stars but just like 'How Stella Got Her Groove Back' by Terry McMillan I love the challenges she presents in her African-American romance novels.
