579330,A20004HGBDOP4E,B00005AW02,HM,"[9, 9]","Ok, I admit it.  While most kids grew up sucking their thumbs, I was more interested in the ear.  It had a soothing quality that would put me to sleep.  Needless to say, when I read that this family had an ear fetish, I just had to see what this was all about.  No, this movie is not just about sucking an earlobe that belongs to your husband's corpse, though I was laughing so hard during this scene, nor is it just another film trying to come across as artsy with an overdose of weirdness that just cannot seem to blend well.  Instead we are presented with a rather strange and different story of a family and their haunting secrets.  It captures a well deserved four stars.What was supposed to be a family reunion for the reading of the will, due to Jeremiah Sparta's (Martin Sheen)death, turns out to be a weekend that reveals just how little they all knew about each other.  Seen mostly through the eyes of Jeremiah's grandson, who decides to be mute after being told to shut up, we see him interact with Jeremiah and his ancestors in the spirit world.  They unload all the juicy tales of the past and it's quite fun to hear all the live folks' interpretation.  After the will is read, this sets the stage for everyone's personal struggle with their haunting secrets.  With solid performances and an engrossing script, you can't help but be drawn into everyone's life as you see all the anger, pain, jealousy and even an unquenchable fetish dissolve.Definitely a keeper.  One you could watch again.  Good sound and picture quality too.",4,Unfolds beautifully . . . leaves you with a smile,1067558400,"10 31, 2003",2003,1540,"['Ok', 'admit', 'most', 'kids', 'grew', 'up', 'sucking', 'thumbs', 'was', 'more', 'interested', 'ear', 'had', 'soothing', 'quality', 'would', 'put', 'sleep', 'Needless', 'say', 'when', 'read', 'family', 'had', 'ear', 'fetish', 'just', 'had', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'No', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'sucking', 'earlobe', 'husband', 'corpse', 'was', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'scene', 'just', 'film', 'trying', 'come', 'artsy', 'overdose', 'weirdness', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'blend', 'well', 'Instead', 'are', 'presented', 'rather', 'strange', 'different', 'story', 'family', 'haunting', 'secrets', 'well', 'deserved', 'four', 'stars.What', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'family', 'reunion', 'reading', 'will', 'due', 'Jeremiah', 'Sparta', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'death', 'out', 'be', 'weekend', 'just', 'how', 'little', 'knew', 'other', 'Seen', 'mostly', 'eyes', 'Jeremiah', 'grandson', 'who', 'be', 'mute', 'being', 'told', 'shut', 'up', 'see', 'interact', 'Jeremiah', 'ancestors', 'spirit', 'world', 'unload', 'juicy', 'tales', 'past', 'quite', 'fun', 'hear', 'live', 'folks', 'interpretation', 'will', 'read', 'stage', 'everyone', 'personal', 'struggle', 'haunting', 'secrets', 'solid', 'performances', 'engrossing', 'script', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'drawn', 'everyone', 'life', 'see', 'anger', 'pain', 'jealousy', 'even', 'unquenchable', 'fetish', 'dissolve.Definitely', 'keeper', 'One', 'could', 'watch', 'again', 'Good', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'too']",A Texas Funeral

And the family.......well, they aren't a Brady Bunch family and I loved the Whitt's because of that fact. They all come together for a funeral and their flaws and secrets are revealed.There are some tear jerker moments in this movie as well as some humorous ones too.  In particular, the scene where one male family member tells another of how he became a man.  I laughed out loud at how it was told!Little Sparta and the camel!  The awesome power of the Whitt ear!
