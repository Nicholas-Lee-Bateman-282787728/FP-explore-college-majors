20066,A34PAZQ73SL163,0767833600,"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!""","[3, 3]","After seeing The General a second time, I have to say that Brendan Gleeson is one of the finest actors of our day. He impresses time and again be it in Troy, Gangs of New York, or in another Irish classic, The Snapper. What's really surprising here is that Jon Voight is nearly as good as Gleeson. His Irish accent is outstanding. The General has the same film noir feel of an early Guy Ritchie effort, but it is infinitely more complex due to its characterization. Perhaps the tale is historically inaccurate, yet this has to be one of the more seamlessly entertaining plots I've encountered. All of the criminal capers are quite novel, and there's nothing rehashed about its specifics. Cahill's strategies are rather amazing from his way he cements his alibis to his handling of his crew. The political facets are an added pleasure such as the way in which the IRA hangs like a poisonous cloud over all criminal activities in the Dublin underworld. One gradually begins to comprehend that they, just like the protestant paramilitaries, are not much different from their targets. What really makes this a five star affair is the uniqueness of Cahill which makes his life one that you'll not soon forget.",5,"""It's Us Against Them.""",1135296000,"12 23, 2005",2005,1204,"['seeing', 'General', 'second', 'time', 'have', 'say', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'one', 'finest', 'actors', 'day', 'time', 'again', 'be', 'Troy', 'Gangs', 'New', 'York', 'Irish', 'classic', 'Snapper', 'What', 'really', 'surprising', 'here', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'Gleeson', 'Irish', 'accent', 'outstanding', 'General', 'same', 'film', 'noir', 'feel', 'early', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'effort', 'infinitely', 'more', 'complex', 'due', 'characterization', 'Perhaps', 'tale', 'historically', 'inaccurate', 'yet', 'be', 'one', 'more', 'seamlessly', 'entertaining', 'plots', ""'ve"", 'encountered', 'criminal', 'capers', 'are', 'quite', 'novel', 'nothing', 'rehashed', 'specifics', 'Cahill', 'strategies', 'are', 'rather', 'amazing', 'way', 'alibis', 'handling', 'crew', 'political', 'facets', 'are', 'added', 'pleasure', 'such', 'way', 'IRA', 'hangs', 'poisonous', 'cloud', 'criminal', 'activities', 'Dublin', 'underworld', 'One', 'gradually', 'comprehend', 'just', 'protestant', 'paramilitaries', 'are', 'not', 'much', 'different', 'targets', 'What', 'really', 'five', 'star', 'affair', 'uniqueness', 'Cahill', 'life', 'one', ""'ll"", 'not', 'soon', 'forget']",N/A
20067,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,0767833600,C. O. DeRiemer,"[17, 19]","Martin Cahill was a real person. He didn't drink or smoke, had a loving if unconventional family life with his wife, her sister and their kids, didn't womanize. He also was clever, funny, charismatic, ruthless, and, up until the end, a successful Dublin criminal (corrected from Belfast; thanks, mad saro). He didn't see his crimes as vice, just as an occupation. In addition to hundreds of burglaries and thefts beginning when he was scarcely a teen, he was smart enough to pull off two immense robberies, the first involving a large number of gold bars and jewels, the other of extremely valuable paintings. He wound up on the bad side of the cops, of the IRA, of the Unionists and even of one of his gang members.John Boorman has written and directed a fascinating life of Martin Cahill, and in Brendan Gleeson he found an actor who has made the role come perfectly to life. Martin Cahill was a shrewd and stubborn man. He grew up in some of the worst of public housing in Dublin. He had no use for the police, except as a butt of his contempt. When civic powers begin to tear down his housing flat, he refused to move. They and the police finally offer him a flat near by. No, he says, I want a house in...and he names one of the better parts of Dublin. ""But wouldn't you rather live with your own kind,"" a pompous city type asks him. ""Oh no,"" Cahill says to the man and to the police standing nearby, ""I'd rather live closer to me work."" He gets his house, and his standard of living improves markedly. As one critic said, Martin Cahill was Robin Hood but with a twist; he stole from the rich and gave to himself. Once when his wife and sister-in-law convince him to buy a nice house, he learns he can't pay for it with cash; he needs a bank draft. He goes to the bank with 80,000 pounds sterling, gets his bank draft...and as soon as he leaves, has his gang rob the bank and retrieve his 80,000.He doesn't like to be questioned and he doesn't like betrayal. When he thinks one of his gang has talked about a theft, he personally nails the man's hands to a snooker table. Afterwards, when he decides the guy must be telling the truth, he pulls the nails out, tells him, ""You came through with flying colors, Jimmy,"" and drives him to the emergency room of a hospital where he insists the doctors treat him immediately.Throughout all of this, he's fascinating. We wind up reluctantly admiring him for facing down the guarda who are after him and who don't have clean hands, either. He's not intimidated by the IRA who tell him clearly they want the take from Cahill's cleverly planned robbery of O'Connor's Wholesale Jewelry warehouse. He faces down with contempt an effort by the Unionists to warn him off their territory. And all the while the guarda have become incensed by Cahill's success and impudence.The end of the movie is the beginning of the movie. We learn Martin Cahill's fate in the first three minutes. The rest of the movie is the intriguing story of just what made Cahill so interesting and so successful as a criminal.Brendan Gleeson is an excellent actor. He's a beefy guy and had to wear a lank comb-over throughout. He captures the charisma and the passion behind Martin Cahill. Cahill may have been the product of Belfast's Catholic slums; he may have had only a sketchy education, but Gleeson nails Cahill as a leader of men, a funny, skeptic, crafty and dangerous man. John Voight plays police inspector Ned Kenny, an aging cop who is determined one way or another to bring Cahill down. Cahill's gang are all made up of first-rate Irish actors, including Adrian Dunbar and Sean McGinley. Maria Doyle Kennedy as Cahill's wife and Angeline Ball as her sister, both of whom share Cahill in a loving and affectionate relationship, are first-rate.John Boorman has created an engrossing portrait of a complex man, and he has produced a movie which is well worth owning and watching. The DVD comes as black-and-white on one side, as it was theatrically shown, and with desaturated color on the other side. Stick with the black-and-white. The DVD transfer is excellent, and the black and white images of Belfast, often damp and dank, add much to the quality of the movie.

20069,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0767833600,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[7, 9]","The home of director John Boorman was one robbed by Martin Cahill, who stole, among other things, the gold record from Boorman's wall for &quot;Dueling Banjos,&quot; the hit single from his film &quot;Deliverance.&quot;  That scene is included in Boorman's 1998 film &quot;The General,&quot; along with Cahill's disgust at learning gold records are not made of gold, and helps to establish the idea that Cahill is an engaging rogue.  Most of that particular task is accomplished by Brendan Gleason, who creates such a likeable character that when he nails one of his men to a snooker table to force a confession, we are inclined to overlook the act of violence.I checked out &quot;The General&quot; after watching &quot;Veronica Guerin,&quot; in which Cahill's murder is an early scene.  Ironically, both films begin the same way, with the death of the title character.  We then go back to the point in their lives where the filmmaker begins to explain how they came to such a violent end.  Cahill starts off stealing potatoes and promising young Frances that he will never be caught.  Having been forced to break this promise once he grows up to be man who plans on avoiding returning to prison by planning his robberies with such care than he is nicknamed &quot;The General.&quot;  But he also has a great sense of flair, which he demonstrates when his wife and mistress, who happen to be sisters, persuade him to buy a house for 80,000 pounds.  Then there is his habit of always wearing a hood or having his hand in front of his face in public so that his picture can never be taken.The Dublin police play into making Cahill look good by sinking to his level and well below.  There is also the clear implication at the start of the film that there were complicit in Cahill's murder, although more by an act of omission than commission.  So when the police put first Cahill and then his gang under 24-hour surveillance, we enjoy it as he finds a series of ways to get the better of them, with relative ease.  In the end, it is not his dealings with the police, but rather his disdain for the IRA that is going to get him killed.Jon Voight plays Ned Kenny, the cop turned inspector who is supposed to be Cahill's nemesis, but who does not really get to do enough to even be a model of futility in his pursuit of the criminal and his gang.  Adrian Dunbar as Noel Curley and Sean McGiley as Gary are Cahill's chief henchmen and it was a treat to see two-thirds of the backup singers from &quot;The Committments&quot; showing up in this film, with Maria Doyle Kennedy as Frances and a black tressed Angeline Ball as Tina.I keep seeing comparisons between Cahill and Robin Hood, followed by an inevitable caveat that Cahill took from the rich and kept it for himself, but I think that misses the mark.  Cahill is more in the mode of Jesse James, who also enjoyed popular support in his community without always spreading around the wealth.  The American outlaw also had more of a violent streak, even in the popular folklore about his robberies, than the outlaw of Sherwood Forest.  Consequently I see the Robin Hood analogy as another attempt to make Cahill look better than he was, which Boorman's film has absolutely no trouble doing.  In the end, &quot;The General&quot; is neither a celebration of Cahill's life nor a warning about the path to be avoided, but a look at a captivating rogue, which is always an interesting journey.",4,"Brendan Gleason as the charming Irish rogue, Martin Cahill",1083196800,"04 29, 2004",2004,3432,"['home', 'director', 'John', 'Boorman', 'was', 'one', 'robbed', 'Martin', 'Cahill', 'who', 'stole', 'other', 'things', 'gold', 'record', 'Boorman', 'wall', 'quot', 'Dueling', 'Banjos', 'quot', 'hit', 'single', 'film', 'quot', 'Deliverance.', 'quot', 'scene', 'included', 'Boorman', '1998', 'film', 'quot', 'General', 'quot', 'Cahill', 'disgust', 'learning', 'gold', 'records', 'are', 'not', 'made', 'gold', 'establish', 'idea', 'Cahill', 'engaging', 'rogue', 'Most', 'particular', 'task', 'accomplished', 'Brendan', 'Gleason', 'who', 'likeable', 'character', 'when', 'one', 'men', 'snooker', 'table', 'force', 'confession', 'are', 'inclined', 'overlook', 'act', 'violence.I', 'checked', 'out', 'quot', 'General', 'quot', 'watching', 'quot', 'Veronica', 'Guerin', 'quot', 'Cahill', 'murder', 'early', 'scene', 'Ironically', 'films', 'begin', 'same', 'way', 'death', 'title', 'character', 'then', 'go', 'back', 'point', 'lives', 'where', 'filmmaker', 'explain', 'how', 'came', 'violent', 'end', 'Cahill', 'stealing', 'potatoes', 'promising', 'young', 'Frances', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'caught', 'Having', 'been', 'forced', 'break', 'promise', 'once', 'up', 'be', 'man', 'who', 'avoiding', 'returning', 'prison', 'planning', 'robberies', 'such', 'care', 'nicknamed', 'quot', 'General.', 'quot', 'also', 'great', 'sense', 'flair', 'when', 'wife', 'mistress', 'who', 'happen', 'be', 'sisters', 'persuade', 'buy', 'house', '80,000', 'pounds', 'Then', 'habit', 'always', 'wearing', 'hood', 'having', 'hand', 'front', 'face', 'public', 'picture', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'taken.The', 'Dublin', 'police', 'play', 'making', 'Cahill', 'look', 'good', 'sinking', 'level', 'well', 'also', 'clear', 'implication', 'start', 'film', 'were', 'complicit', 'Cahill', 'murder', 'more', 'act', 'omission', 'commission', 'So', 'when', 'police', 'put', 'first', 'Cahill', 'then', 'gang', '24-hour', 'surveillance', 'enjoy', 'series', 'ways', 'get', 'better', 'relative', 'ease', 'end', 'not', 'dealings', 'police', 'rather', 'disdain', 'IRA', 'going', 'get', 'killed.Jon', 'Voight', 'plays', 'Ned', 'Kenny', 'cop', 'turned', 'inspector', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'Cahill', 'nemesis', 'who', 'not', 'really', 'get', 'do', 'enough', 'even', 'be', 'model', 'futility', 'pursuit', 'criminal', 'gang', 'Adrian', 'Dunbar', 'Noel', 'Curley', 'Sean', 'McGiley', 'Gary', 'are', 'Cahill', 'chief', 'henchmen', 'was', 'treat', 'see', 'two-thirds', 'backup', 'singers', 'quot', 'Committments', 'quot', 'showing', 'up', 'film', 'Maria', 'Doyle', 'Kennedy', 'Frances', 'black', 'tressed', 'Angeline', 'Ball', 'Tina.I', 'keep', 'seeing', 'comparisons', 'Cahill', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'followed', 'inevitable', 'caveat', 'Cahill', 'took', 'rich', 'kept', 'think', 'mark', 'Cahill', 'more', 'mode', 'Jesse', 'James', 'who', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'popular', 'support', 'community', 'always', 'spreading', 'wealth', 'American', 'outlaw', 'also', 'had', 'more', 'violent', 'streak', 'even', 'popular', 'folklore', 'robberies', 'outlaw', 'Sherwood', 'Forest', 'Consequently', 'see', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'analogy', 'attempt', 'make', 'Cahill', 'look', 'better', 'was', 'Boorman', 'film', 'absolutely', 'trouble', 'doing', 'end', 'quot', 'General', 'quot', 'celebration', 'Cahill', 'life', 'warning', 'path', 'be', 'avoided', 'look', 'captivating', 'rogue', 'always', 'interesting', 'journey']",N/A

Cahill (superbly played by Brendan Gleeson), goes through the gangster's usual career arc: tough kid from tough project; increasingly successful, big, talk of the town thefts; finally, too high a profile, which is his undoing: he is, increasingly, seen as an enemy by the then very powerful Irish Republican Army.Gleeson, a talented, flexible, very popular actor, though not a very good-looking one, may never have played lead in any other movie, although he's made many.  But he inhabits Cahill, called ""The General"" by his troops, as if born to play the titular part.  He's sure perfect for it physically.  He's ably assisted by the also very popular Adrian Dunbar, as his lieutenant, Noel.  Sean McGinley does a memorable turn as Gary, one of the regulars.  The lucky, or unlucky sisters, depending on how you feel about their situation, who spend their lives mixed up with Cahill, are also young women we've seen before-- Maria Doyle Kennedy and Angeline Ball, who were two of the three girls singing backup in ""The Commitments.""  The American Jon Voigt, who plays Cahill's Javert, Inspector Ned Kenny, manages to do it quite well, and in as thick and incomprehensible a Dublin accent as any of the others. This company achieves some very powerful, profoundly troubling, scenes together.The compact disc is rather an oddity; you can watch the picture in black and white, or in ""desaturated color.""  If you pick color, you are getting a censored, cleaned-up script.  The disc also offers those more legible yellow subtitles, in English.  If you were born on this side of the Atlantic, you'd better go for them: that Dublin accent is very very difficult.  It is a pity; the movie's flaws militate against its popularity, and it deserves better.",4,"Fine, Little-Noticed Gangster Flick",1193011200,"10 22, 2007",2007,2319,"['General', '1998', 'fine', 'Dublin-set', 'gangster', 'flick', 'based', 'life', 'well-known', 'Irish', 'gangster', 'Martin', 'Cahill', 'was', 'written', 'film', 'script', 'produced', 'directed', 'British', 'director', 'John', 'Boorman', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'latter-day', 'film', 'noir', 'was', 'theatrically', 'released', 'black', 'white', 'shot', 'darkest', 'humor', 'not', 'end', 'well', 'gangster', 'protaganist', 'received', 'Boston', 'Society', 'Film', 'Critics', 'Award', 'release.The', 'movie', 'flashback', 'frame', 'mechanism', 'know', 'outcome', 'beginning', 'Cahill', 'superbly', 'played', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'gangster', 'usual', 'career', 'arc', 'tough', 'kid', 'tough', 'project', 'increasingly', 'successful', 'big', 'talk', 'town', 'thefts', 'finally', 'too', 'high', 'profile', 'undoing', 'increasingly', 'seen', 'enemy', 'then', 'very', 'powerful', 'Irish', 'Republican', 'Army.Gleeson', 'talented', 'flexible', 'very', 'popular', 'actor', 'not', 'very', 'good-looking', 'one', 'may', 'never', 'have', 'played', 'lead', 'other', 'movie', 'made', 'many', 'Cahill', 'called', 'General', 'troops', 'born', 'play', 'titular', 'part', 'sure', 'perfect', 'physically', 'ably', 'assisted', 'also', 'very', 'popular', 'Adrian', 'Dunbar', 'lieutenant', 'Noel', 'Sean', 'McGinley', 'memorable', 'turn', 'Gary', 'one', 'regulars', 'lucky', 'unlucky', 'sisters', 'depending', 'how', 'feel', 'situation', 'who', 'spend', 'lives', 'mixed', 'up', 'Cahill', 'are', 'also', 'young', 'women', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Maria', 'Doyle', 'Kennedy', 'Angeline', 'Ball', 'who', 'were', 'two', 'three', 'girls', 'singing', 'backup', 'Commitments', 'American', 'Jon', 'Voigt', 'who', 'Cahill', 'Javert', 'Inspector', 'Ned', 'Kenny', 'do', 'quite', 'well', 'thick', 'incomprehensible', 'Dublin', 'accent', 'others', 'company', 'very', 'powerful', 'profoundly', 'troubling', 'scenes', 'together.The', 'compact', 'disc', 'rather', 'oddity', 'can', 'watch', 'picture', 'black', 'white', 'desaturated', 'color', 'pick', 'color', 'are', 'getting', 'censored', 'cleaned-up', 'script', 'disc', 'also', 'more', 'legible', 'yellow', 'subtitles', 'English', 'were', 'born', 'side', 'Atlantic', ""'d"", 'better', 'go', 'Dublin', 'accent', 'very', 'very', 'difficult', 'pity', 'movie', 'flaws', 'militate', 'popularity', 'better']",N/A

20076,AW7BIYHXUIZ62,0767833600,T.M. Reader,"[0, 1]","This film tells the story from the 1980's of the celebrated Irish thief and sometimes folk hero, Martin Cahill.An interesting film.  I am not as well educated on the turmoil of Irish politics in that era as I would like to be.  It appears to me that Cahill is presented as the enemy of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in that he was a competitor in crime -- and he was simulyaneously an enemy of the ruling government, simply in that he was a career criminal with some notorious heists to his credit and a bent for thumbing his nose at the authorities.  He had meager beginnings, but clawed his way up.  He lived very comfortably.  He was also living in an open bigamous relationship with his wife and her sister.  I think he is rather inappropriately potrayed as a kind of Robin Hood.  His story has parallels as well to Al Capone, however.  Cahill is merely a theiving thug, with no activity in prostitution, drugs, protection rackets, etc.  He is vocal against illicit drugs, but is shown to have engaged in jury tampering (a most egregious crime in my opinion).  In the end -- he was just a criminal with high aspirations, and not a hero by any measure.As I said, this is an interesting film and an interesting story.  Brendan Gleeson is absolutely believable as the hulking Cahill.  Superb performance.  John Voight is as believable as the understated Irish cop that hounds Cahill, accent and all.Strange film technique, ranging from full color to black and white, to a muted in-between.  I had trouble deciding if it was a production defect or a technical ploy by the director.  Maybe a second viewing would reveal something.  I had a little difficulty hearing much of the dialogue through the authentic but thick Irish accents. Fimed on location in Dublin.An ""off the beaten track"" movie that I think was worth my time.",4,Story of the 1980's Irish criminal - folk hero Martin Cahill,1221350400,"09 14, 2008",2008,1826,"['film', 'story', '1980', 'celebrated', 'Irish', 'thief', 'sometimes', 'folk', 'hero', 'Martin', 'Cahill.An', 'interesting', 'film', 'am', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'educated', 'turmoil', 'Irish', 'politics', 'era', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'Cahill', 'presented', 'enemy', 'Irish', 'Republican', 'Army', 'IRA', 'was', 'competitor', 'crime', 'was', 'simulyaneously', 'enemy', 'ruling', 'government', 'simply', 'was', 'career', 'criminal', 'notorious', 'heists', 'credit', 'bent', 'thumbing', 'nose', 'authorities', 'had', 'meager', 'beginnings', 'clawed', 'way', 'up', 'lived', 'very', 'comfortably', 'was', 'also', 'living', 'open', 'bigamous', 'relationship', 'wife', 'sister', 'think', 'rather', 'inappropriately', 'potrayed', 'kind', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'story', 'parallels', 'as', 'well', 'Al', 'Capone', 'however', 'Cahill', 'merely', 'theiving', 'thug', 'activity', 'prostitution', 'drugs', 'protection', 'rackets', 'etc', 'vocal', 'illicit', 'drugs', 'shown', 'have', 'engaged', 'jury', 'tampering', 'most', 'egregious', 'crime', 'opinion', 'end', 'was', 'just', 'criminal', 'high', 'aspirations', 'not', 'hero', 'measure.As', 'said', 'interesting', 'film', 'interesting', 'story', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'absolutely', 'believable', 'hulking', 'Cahill', 'Superb', 'performance', 'John', 'Voight', 'as', 'believable', 'understated', 'Irish', 'cop', 'Cahill', 'accent', 'all.Strange', 'film', 'technique', 'ranging', 'full', 'color', 'black', 'white', 'muted', 'in-between', 'had', 'trouble', 'deciding', 'was', 'production', 'defect', 'technical', 'ploy', 'director', 'Maybe', 'second', 'viewing', 'would', 'reveal', 'something', 'had', 'little', 'difficulty', 'hearing', 'much', 'dialogue', 'authentic', 'thick', 'Irish', 'accents', 'Fimed', 'location', 'Dublin.An', 'beaten', 'track', 'movie', 'think', 'was', 'worth', 'time']",N/A
20077,A220FJEQNGMSRN,0767833600,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 1]","John Boorman's 1998 The General was hailed as a major comeback, though it's hard to see why on the evidence of the film itself. One of three films made that year about famed Dublin criminal Martin Cahill (alongside Ordinary Decent Criminal and Vicious Circles), it has an abundance of incident and style (the film was shot in color but released in b&w; Scope in some territories) but makes absolutely no impact and just goes on forever. With a main character who threatens witnesses, car bombs doctors, causes a hundred people to lose their jobs, tries to buy off the sexually abused daughter of one of his gang to keep out of jail and nails one of his own to a snooker table yet still remains a popular local legend and an attractive enough personality for his wife to not only approve but actually suggest a m&eacute;nage a trios with her sister, it needs a charismatic central performance to sell the character and the film. It doesn't get it. Instead, it's lumbered with what may well be Brendan Gleeson's worst and most disinterested performance: he delivers his lines and stands in the right place but there's nothing to suggest either a local hero or the inner workings of a complex character. On the plus side, this helps not to overglamorize a character who is nothing more than an egotistical thug, but it's at odds with a script that seems to be expecting us to love him and his antics.There's a minor section that picks up interest when the IRA whips up a local hate campaign against the `General' and his men, painting them as `anti-social' drug dealers purely because Cahill won't share his loot from a robbery with them, but its temporary resolution is so vaguely shot - something to do with Cahill donning a balaclava and joining the protestors which we're expected to find loveably cheeky - that it's just thrown away. Things are more successful in the last third as the pressure mounts and his army falls apart, but by then it's too late to really care. Adrian Dunbar, Maria Doyle Kennedy and the gorgeous Angeline Ball do good work in adoring supporting roles, but Jon Voight's hammy Garda beat cop seems to be there more for American sales than moral balance, overcompensating for Gleeson's comatose non-involvement in what feels like a total misfire.

20078,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,0767833600,Westley,"[1, 1]","Brendan Gleeson is Martin ""The General"" Cahill in this character study of the real-life Irish gangster.  Cahill started as a petty thief as a teenager, and as he gets older he wisely organizes men from his neighborhood into a very loyal and brutal gang.  Eventually, the Irish police (Garda) begin to target him, especially Inspector Ned Kenny (Jon Voight).  After his gang robs a large jewelry company (something even the IRA ruled out as impossible), he is put under constant surveillance by the Garda.  However, Cahill is clever and protects himself; for example, he hides his face in public and sues the press for libel when they try to link him to crimes.  However, the constant pressure from the police as well as demands from the IRA for a share of his booty start to take a toll on him.English Director John Boorman has long lived in Ireland, and he clearly understands this character.  In fact, Cahill once robbed Boorman's house, stealing jewelry and his gold record for the soundtrack for ""Deliverance.""  Cahill is an inherently interesting character - a gangster who wasn't afraid of taunting the law and who made his own rules.  For example, he married his childhood sweetheart, Frances, and later also fell in love with her sister Tina.  Amazingly, the sisters seemed to accept this arrangement, and both of them had children with The General.  Despite the inherently florid story, Boorman wisely presents it in a mostly factual, docudrama manner, but with some nice touches of humor.  The movie does, though, become a bit repetitive and could have been cut down a bit.The main strength of the movie is Brendan Gleeson.  I've never been a particular fan of his work, but he is very good here.  His performance captures the unhinged nature of The General, and his gradual unraveling is realistically portrayed.  Frankly, I'm surprised that ""The General"" hasn't become popular with fans of gangster movies; it seems like a natural for fans of ""Scarface"" and ""Goodfellas.""
