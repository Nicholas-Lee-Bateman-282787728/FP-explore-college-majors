Good descriptives for the Franco Zeffirelli film ""Tea with Mussolini""!Considered autobiographical of Zeffirelli himself, this film soars--and one can readily see Franco's  cinematic touches--not only with the all-star cast (a trite expression but  nonetheless apt) but with the storyline itself.Set just shortly  before World War II in Florence, the movie showcases a group of proper  British ladies (where else would they be but in Italy?) who  seemperfectly at peace here.  They have undertaken the care of a young  outcast boy and set about to teach him proper British ways.  They interact  as if there were no cares.  After all, they have the personal world of Il  Duce that no harm will come to them should the war descend.  And descend it  does and only the naive (Maggie Smith) could believe in the integrity of  Mussolini!  These expatriate Brits choose to stay in Italy and, of course,  the worst case scenario transpires.  They are caught in the crossfires of  the war machine.  The other ladies in the film include Cher, Joan  Plowright, Judi Dench, and Lily Tomlin.Cher scores one of her best  roles as the lone American in the film, a friend of the British ladies, and  as the war continues, even her money and influence are  no longer enough to  save her.  Her Jewish background does not settle well with the Fascists  there, who are more than eager to please Herr Hitler and his war  machine.Zeffirelli fills his film with typical cinematic  beauty--whether it be in the actors, the acting, the scenery, the score,  it's all superb.  His ability to fuse the drama with appropriate amounts of  comic relieve also add to the film, and his reputation.

470349,A358XP3X4U0X45,6305600953,bookloversfriend,"[31, 31]","In spite of the disastrous title and the repulsive cover picture, this is the best film Zeffirelli has made since ""Romeo and Juliet.""  It has a nice balance of atmosphere, characterization and action.  The photography and scenery alone are worth the price of admission.  Missing is the magnificent music that Zeffirelli usually has in his films.  Contrary to the amazon reviewer, the film is quite focused and carries with it a tension, although the tension is deliberately kept from becoming oppressive.  The path of the story is not at all ""predictable"" with several surprising turns.  There are a few laughs in the beginning, but this is a serious film.I went back to Zeffirelli's Autobiography to re-read the passages dealing with the scorpioni.  They were real, of course, but apparently this story is fictional, as are all the characters except Mary Wallace.  Zeffirelli put some incidents from his own life into the movie, and the actor who played Luca bears a striking resemblance to the young Zeffirelli, but that is all.  Zeffirelli was illegitimate.  He lived with his mother the first few years until she died.  He was then brought up by a cousin.  He was accosted by his father's wife, and his father did put him to study English with one of the old English ladies of Florence, Mary O'Neill, who was fond of playing the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet with him.  But when the scorpioni were rounded up and shipped out of Florence, Zeffirelli says (p. 24) that he never saw Mary O'Neill again.  He hid out in the mountains to avoid the draft and headed south, finally meeting up with the Allied front lines.  The encounter with them in the movie is more or less like the book.I would like to have seen a little more of the scorpioni before the war hit, but I'm sure I'll be watching this movie again and again.",5,worth seeing,1158278400,"09 15, 2006",2006,1826,"['spite', 'disastrous', 'title', 'repulsive', 'cover', 'picture', 'best', 'film', 'Zeffirelli', 'made', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'nice', 'balance', 'atmosphere', 'characterization', 'action', 'photography', 'scenery', 'alone', 'are', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'Missing', 'magnificent', 'music', 'Zeffirelli', 'usually', 'films', 'Contrary', 'amazon', 'reviewer', 'film', 'quite', 'focused', 'tension', 'tension', 'deliberately', 'kept', 'becoming', 'oppressive', 'path', 'story', 'not', 'predictable', 'several', 'surprising', 'turns', 'are', 'few', 'laughs', 'beginning', 'serious', 'film.I', 'went', 'back', 'Zeffirelli', 'Autobiography', 're-read', 'passages', 'dealing', 'scorpioni', 'were', 'real', 'course', 'apparently', 'story', 'fictional', 'are', 'characters', 'Mary', 'Wallace', 'Zeffirelli', 'put', 'incidents', 'own', 'life', 'movie', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Luca', 'striking', 'resemblance', 'young', 'Zeffirelli', 'Zeffirelli', 'was', 'illegitimate', 'lived', 'mother', 'first', 'few', 'years', 'died', 'was', 'then', 'brought', 'up', 'cousin', 'was', 'accosted', 'father', 'wife', 'father', 'did', 'put', 'study', 'English', 'one', 'old', 'English', 'ladies', 'Florence', 'Mary', ""O'Neill"", 'who', 'was', 'fond', 'playing', 'balcony', 'scene', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'when', 'scorpioni', 'were', 'rounded', 'up', 'shipped', 'Florence', 'Zeffirelli', 'p.', '24', 'never', 'saw', 'Mary', ""O'Neill"", 'again', 'hid', 'out', 'mountains', 'avoid', 'draft', 'headed', 'south', 'finally', 'meeting', 'up', 'Allied', 'front', 'lines', 'encounter', 'movie', 'more', 'less', 'book.I', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'seen', 'little', 'more', 'scorpioni', 'war', 'hit', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'movie', 'again', 'again']",N/A
470350,A1YB29BIDULEYE,6305600953,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[4, 4]","Whenever director Franco Zeffirelli is at the helm, you can be assured of great acting, fascinating scenery, and beautiful music. He has shown this in his ""Romeo and Juliet,"" ""Taming of the Shrew,"" ""Hamlet,"" and ""Jesus of Nazareth."" Generally speaking, I DO NOT like war movies. Mainly because one, they tend to glorify people getting killed. Also, because character development normally takes a back seat to people getting blown up. Well, this movie qualifies as an exception. The story starts in Italy few years before World War II. The young Luca gradually realizes that his mother has died. To be sure, his father helps a little, but very little. Well Luca falls under the care of Maggie Smith (English), Joan Plowright (English), Judi Dench (English), Cher (Jewish), and Lily Tomlin (American). What these women share in common is that Italy will of course declare war on their different countries. Mussolini promises Maggie Smith (who may be able to provide some diplomatic favors) that she and her friends will be safe. Of course we don't need to think too hard to understand that this promise will only be carried through if it serves Mussolini in some way. (Despite the title, Mussolini only has a brief part.) Well, later, Luca's father decides that German ""...is the language of tomorrow."" So, Luca has to leave these women who were so kind to him. And of course, Italy joins Germany in the war. These women become prisoners, though not all at once. (Cher and Lily Tomlin have a bit more time of freedom.) Well, Luca (now grown up) returns, and offers what comfort he can to these women. He also has an on and off relationship with the energetic Cher. While Cher has her faults, she is heroic. She shows care for the Jews who will be in danger if they don't get out of Italy. She also uses her own money to move Smith, Plowright, and Dench to a hotel. (It is still a prison, but it is more of a country club type prison.) Another plot comes into play when a playboy is after Cher's money. Maggie Smith does not care for Cher, but will she rise to the occasion and save Cher? What makes this so different (as far as war movies are concerned) is that the war is in the background. The real story is the suffering of these women. So, we have the horrors of war without the glory. (But we can trust that Hollywood probably won't ever figure this out.) Interestingly, Luca never loses his love of art, and in a moment of desperation, Dench throws herself in front of art to stop the Nazis from blowing it up. Even if you don't like war movies, this is one you should make an exception for. If you like this, be sure to see Director Franco Zeffirelli's ""Romeo and Juliet,"" ""Taming of the Shrew,"" ""Hamlet,"" and ""Jesus of Nazareth.""",4,You Can't Go Wrong With Director Franco Zeffirelli!,1154044800,"07 28, 2006",2006,2735,"['Whenever', 'director', 'Franco', 'Zeffirelli', 'helm', 'can', 'be', 'assured', 'great', 'acting', 'fascinating', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'music', 'shown', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'Hamlet', 'Jesus', 'Nazareth', 'Generally', 'speaking', 'DO', 'NOT', 'war', 'movies', 'Mainly', 'one', 'tend', 'glorify', 'people', 'getting', 'killed', 'Also', 'character', 'development', 'normally', 'back', 'seat', 'people', 'getting', 'blown', 'up', 'Well', 'movie', 'exception', 'story', 'Italy', 'few', 'years', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'young', 'Luca', 'gradually', 'mother', 'died', 'be', 'sure', 'father', 'little', 'very', 'little', 'Well', 'Luca', 'care', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'English', 'Joan', 'Plowright', 'English', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'English', 'Cher', 'Jewish', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'American', 'What', 'women', 'share', 'common', 'Italy', 'will', 'course', 'declare', 'war', 'different', 'countries', 'Mussolini', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'provide', 'diplomatic', 'favors', 'friends', 'will', 'be', 'safe', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'think', 'too', 'hard', 'understand', 'promise', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'carried', 'Mussolini', 'way', 'title', 'Mussolini', 'only', 'brief', 'part', 'Well', 'later', 'Luca', 'father', 'German', 'language', 'tomorrow', 'So', 'Luca', 'leave', 'women', 'who', 'were', 'so', 'kind', 'course', 'Italy', 'Germany', 'war', 'women', 'become', 'prisoners', 'not', 'once', 'Cher', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'have', 'bit', 'more', 'time', 'freedom', 'Well', 'Luca', 'now', 'grown', 'up', 'returns', 'what', 'comfort', 'can', 'women', 'also', 'relationship', 'energetic', 'Cher', 'Cher', 'faults', 'heroic', 'care', 'Jews', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'danger', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Italy', 'also', 'own', 'money', 'move', 'Smith', 'Plowright', 'Dench', 'hotel', 'still', 'prison', 'more', 'country', 'club', 'type', 'prison', 'plot', 'play', 'when', 'playboy', 'Cher', 'money', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'not', 'care', 'Cher', 'will', 'rise', 'occasion', 'save', 'Cher', 'What', 'so', 'different', 'as', 'far', 'war', 'movies', 'are', 'concerned', 'war', 'background', 'real', 'story', 'suffering', 'women', 'So', 'have', 'horrors', 'war', 'glory', 'can', 'trust', 'Hollywood', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'figure', 'out', 'Interestingly', 'Luca', 'never', 'love', 'art', 'moment', 'desperation', 'Dench', 'front', 'art', 'stop', 'Nazis', 'blowing', 'up', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'war', 'movies', 'one', 'should', 'make', 'exception', 'like', 'be', 'sure', 'see', 'Director', 'Franco', 'Zeffirelli', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'Hamlet', 'Jesus', 'Nazareth']",N/A

This semi-autobiographical coming of age story fits so well among the usual coming of age stories of people in the arts.  So many of these people have grown up with a close mothering or woman-based support system.  That the child-teen here is not legitimate and has a whole clan of English and American women to raise him in Fascist-filled 1930s' and 1940s' Italy, makes him virtually predestined for a career in the arts. These women are even willing to risk their lives to preserve Italian frescoes, which only an artist would bother to recount.  The ensemble cast of women is superb.  Maggie Smith has the English elitist down perfectly by this point in her career and she can be quietly hilarious playing it, especially in her misguided belief that &quot;Il Duce&quot; is protecting her in Italy. Cher returns to the screen in a wonderfully luminous role as a wealthy American entertainer, who is also Jewish and about to be sold to out to the Germans by her Italian boyfriend.

B Collins Jr.,"[0, 0]","Here is a film with an outstanding cast of actors, photographed in Florence Italy and the surrounding Tuscan area, and directed by a man with an eye for beauty. It should be a success but unfortunately it just does not hold together.  After seeing the film I tried to put my finger on why it does not succeed. I think the problem is that the script is weak and overly sentimental and there are just too many actors which means in essence that everyone plays a cameo. When everyone plays a cameo role in a play full of stereotypes, there is no glue to hold the pieces together.  In this case, Zeffirelli tried to use the story of the illegitimate boy, Luca, mothered by all the women in the film, as the feature that keeps everyone together, but it just barely works and does not really work well.  I loved the photography of Florence in the first 30 minutes of the film, it is obvious that Zeffirelli loves the city, as did generations of English citizens who made this city home away from Great Britain. Cutting the characters played by Lily Tomlin and Judi Dench and removing the obvious predictable aspects of the script would have strengthened this film.",3,The film gets a passing grade but it is not a winner,1389225600,"01 9, 2014",2014,1158,"['Here', 'film', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'actors', 'photographed', 'Florence', 'Italy', 'surrounding', 'Tuscan', 'area', 'directed', 'man', 'eye', 'beauty', 'should', 'be', 'success', 'unfortunately', 'just', 'not', 'hold', 'together', 'seeing', 'film', 'tried', 'put', 'finger', 'why', 'not', 'succeed', 'think', 'problem', 'script', 'weak', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'actors', 'essence', 'everyone', 'cameo', 'When', 'everyone', 'cameo', 'role', 'play', 'full', 'stereotypes', 'glue', 'hold', 'pieces', 'together', 'case', 'Zeffirelli', 'tried', 'use', 'story', 'illegitimate', 'boy', 'Luca', 'mothered', 'women', 'film', 'feature', 'everyone', 'together', 'just', 'barely', 'works', 'not', 'really', 'work', 'well', 'loved', 'photography', 'Florence', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'obvious', 'Zeffirelli', 'city', 'did', 'generations', 'English', 'citizens', 'who', 'made', 'city', 'home', 'away', 'Great', 'Britain', 'Cutting', 'characters', 'played', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'removing', 'obvious', 'predictable', 'aspects', 'script', 'would', 'have', 'strengthened', 'film']",N/A
470355,A1S3C5OFU508P3,6305600953,Charles Ashbacher,"[7, 7]","I enjoyed this movie, it accurately portrays some of the English fascination with Benito Mussolini before the second world war. The setting is Florence with all its incredible artwork and the major players are a collection of eccentric English women, two unusual American women and an Italian boy born to the mistress of a married man. His father does not want to have a relationship with the boy, so he is ""adopted"" by the man's English secretary.Cher plays a wealthy and eccentric American woman that is good-hearted but very nave in the ways of the world. In the beginning, the women utter the clich&eacute;, ""Mussolini makes the trains run on time."" However, as there is growing evidence that Mussolini's regime is a thugocracy, they go into denial. One of the women, the widow of a former ambassador, manages to schedule a tea session with the Italian dictator. In his typical bombastic style, Mussolini pledges to uphold their dignity and keep them safe.Eventually, the war comes and the British women are interned as enemy aliens. The widow of the ambassador believes that Mussolini is the one paying for their keep when it is in fact the Cher character. When America is drawn into the war and the Americans join the British ladies in confinement, a slick Italian man cons the Cher character out of all of her assets. Her response is to retire to her room in total defeat. She is finally brought out of her depression by a visit from the ambassador's widow, who admits to her mistakes and past snobbishness, but now points out that they must work together if they are to survive. From that point on, the women work together to try to protect the artwork and eventually the Americans drive out the German troops. The last scenes where the women stand up to the Germans and then the Americans are hilarious.The interaction between the women is excellent; all play their roles exceptionally well. As a peek into the inter-war period and how the British viewed the Mussolini regime this movie is excellent. It is loosely based on the life of the filmmaker Franco Zeffirelli and demonstrates a tragedy of history.Mussolini was originally in strong opposition to Adolph Hitler and his expansionist plans in Europe. He was the one that stopped Hitler when he first attempted to annex Austria. While Italy was in no way a superpower, it was in Mussolini's best interest to stay out of the war and play to both sides. And had he remained opposed to Hitler, the war would have gone quite differently.",5,The scenes where the women stand up to the Germans and then the Americans are priceless,1177632000,"04 27, 2007",2007,2497,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'accurately', 'English', 'fascination', 'Benito', 'Mussolini', 'second', 'world', 'war', 'setting', 'Florence', 'incredible', 'artwork', 'major', 'players', 'are', 'collection', 'eccentric', 'English', 'women', 'two', 'unusual', 'American', 'women', 'Italian', 'boy', 'born', 'mistress', 'married', 'man', 'father', 'not', 'want', 'have', 'relationship', 'boy', 'adopted', 'man', 'English', 'secretary.Cher', 'wealthy', 'eccentric', 'American', 'woman', 'good-hearted', 'very', 'nave', 'ways', 'world', 'beginning', 'women', 'utter', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Mussolini', 'trains', 'run', 'time', 'However', 'growing', 'evidence', 'Mussolini', 'regime', 'thugocracy', 'go', 'denial', 'One', 'women', 'widow', 'former', 'ambassador', 'schedule', 'tea', 'session', 'Italian', 'dictator', 'typical', 'bombastic', 'style', 'Mussolini', 'uphold', 'dignity', 'keep', 'safe.Eventually', 'war', 'British', 'women', 'are', 'interned', 'enemy', 'aliens', 'widow', 'ambassador', 'Mussolini', 'one', 'paying', 'keep', 'when', 'fact', 'Cher', 'character', 'When', 'America', 'drawn', 'war', 'Americans', 'join', 'British', 'ladies', 'confinement', 'slick', 'Italian', 'man', 'Cher', 'character', 'assets', 'response', 'retire', 'room', 'total', 'defeat', 'finally', 'brought', 'out', 'depression', 'visit', 'ambassador', 'widow', 'who', 'mistakes', 'past', 'snobbishness', 'now', 'out', 'must', 'work', 'together', 'are', 'survive', 'point', 'women', 'work', 'together', 'try', 'protect', 'artwork', 'eventually', 'Americans', 'drive', 'out', 'German', 'troops', 'last', 'scenes', 'where', 'women', 'stand', 'up', 'Germans', 'then', 'Americans', 'are', 'hilarious.The', 'interaction', 'women', 'excellent', 'play', 'roles', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'peek', 'inter-war', 'period', 'how', 'British', 'viewed', 'Mussolini', 'regime', 'movie', 'excellent', 'loosely', 'based', 'life', 'filmmaker', 'Franco', 'Zeffirelli', 'tragedy', 'history.Mussolini', 'was', 'originally', 'strong', 'opposition', 'Adolph', 'Hitler', 'expansionist', 'plans', 'Europe', 'was', 'one', 'stopped', 'Hitler', 'when', 'first', 'attempted', 'annex', 'Austria', 'Italy', 'was', 'way', 'superpower', 'was', 'Mussolini', 'best', 'interest', 'stay', 'war', 'play', 'sides', 'had', 'remained', 'opposed', 'Hitler', 'war', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'quite', 'differently']",N/A

470357,A10XZH78SDOI5M,6305600953,C. Matthew Curtin,"[8, 8]","When it was first released, my wife and I saw Tea with Mussolini at a small theater in our neighborhood, the Drexel East theater in Bexley. The cast was simply wonderful, bringing a multidimensional story to life, complete with a whole set of characters of depth and realism.The movie's official tagline is, ""a story of civilized disobedience,"" but I found myself focusing on rather a different part of the story, that of a young boy who became a man. The young boy, Luca, was the illegitimate son of an Italian businessman. With his mother dead and his father absent, Luca is raised by an Englishwoman, Mary Wallace (Joan Plowright), who is part of a group of English living it Italy just before World War II. Mary enlists help from her friends to ensure that the boy is taken care of. A wealthy American who sometimes lived among the English ""Scorpioni,"" Elsa Morganthal Strauss-Armistan (Cher), was a friend of Luca's mother and set up a trust for him.Mary not only ensured that Luca was going to school and pursuing his studies, but she spent time with him, spoke with him, and instilled in him the values that would make him a proper English gentleman--apparently the only desire that his father had for him.As Italy became increasingly aligned with Nazi Germany, the charming and peaceful existence in Florence gave way to incarceration for the Scorpioni, and a great deal of mystery surrounding Elsa. Luca was sent to an Austrian boarding school, as his father determined that Italy's future was not with England, but with Germany. After his studies, he returned to Italy, and soon found himself jealous of Elsa's Italian lover, deeply infatuated with her, and in her employ: secretly delivering documents that would allow their Jewish recipients to flee the country.I was especially taken with the character of Mary; not only was she able to perceive what was right and wrong but she acted on it and worked good among those within her sphere of influence. Her strength, moral courage, and gentleness made quite a difference for young Luca. And he was wise enough usually to pay attention. Even after he had gone off to school and returned fully grown, Mary did not hold back from correcting him when he behaved badly. She became cross with him when his youthful jealousy blinded him; even so, in her reprimand, she offered him what he needed not just to understand that he was wrong but what he must do to correct his course. ""What are your hurt feelings when there are lives at stake?""Rather than stupidly insisting on pursuing his misstep, Luca wisely took the lesson; he not only quit complaining about being Elsa's ""messenger boy"" but also used the money that Elsa had years earlier put into a trust for him to help the resistance and to get Elsa to safety when her life was in danger. When the resistance asked where he got the money, he told Wilfred Random, Lady Hester's grandson, that the money was intended to help him grow up, but that it didn't help very much because he forgot the first rule of a gentleman: love thyself last.  (This is a reference to Shakespeare's Henry VIII, which reminded us of a wonderful scene earlier, when Mary used Shakespeare to entertain and to teach the young boy under her guidance.)In his corrected action, Luca set aside whatever inconvenience and heartache he had, moving beyond them, taking action intended for more than just ""to feel good"" or ""to have fun,"" but to adhere to a principle that was important to him, one that was instilled, we presume, by Mary Wallace. It had an impact was both concrete and specific: it saved the life of a woman whose generosity with her fortune allowed him to be educated and raised in relative comfort. He acted well in the moment, and (as Johann Kaspar said) performed a good action to all eternity. Would that others thus behaved; what atrocities might have been avoided.Tea With Mussolini is a delight, a story both worthy of consideration and immensely pleasurable to watch.",4,Becoming a man in a world gone mad.,1149724800,"06 8, 2006",2006,3968,"['When', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'wife', 'saw', 'Tea', 'Mussolini', 'small', 'theater', 'neighborhood', 'Drexel', 'East', 'theater', 'Bexley', 'cast', 'was', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'bringing', 'multidimensional', 'story', 'life', 'complete', 'whole', 'set', 'characters', 'depth', 'realism.The', 'movie', 'official', 'tagline', 'story', 'civilized', 'disobedience', 'found', 'focusing', 'rather', 'different', 'part', 'story', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'became', 'man', 'young', 'boy', 'Luca', 'was', 'illegitimate', 'son', 'Italian', 'businessman', 'mother', 'dead', 'father', 'absent', 'Luca', 'raised', 'Englishwoman', 'Mary', 'Wallace', 'Joan', 'Plowright', 'who', 'part', 'group', 'English', 'living', 'Italy', 'just', 'before', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Mary', 'help', 'friends', 'ensure', 'boy', 'taken', 'care', 'wealthy', 'American', 'who', 'sometimes', 'lived', 'English', 'Scorpioni', 'Elsa', 'Morganthal', 'Strauss-Armistan', 'Cher', 'was', 'friend', 'Luca', 'mother', 'set', 'up', 'trust', 'him.Mary', 'not', 'only', 'ensured', 'Luca', 'was', 'going', 'school', 'pursuing', 'studies', 'spent', 'time', 'spoke', 'instilled', 'values', 'would', 'make', 'proper', 'English', 'gentleman', 'apparently', 'only', 'desire', 'father', 'had', 'him.As', 'Italy', 'became', 'increasingly', 'aligned', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'charming', 'peaceful', 'existence', 'Florence', 'gave', 'way', 'incarceration', 'Scorpioni', 'great', 'deal', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'Elsa', 'Luca', 'was', 'sent', 'Austrian', 'boarding', 'school', 'father', 'determined', 'Italy', 'future', 'was', 'not', 'England', 'Germany', 'studies', 'returned', 'Italy', 'soon', 'found', 'jealous', 'Elsa', 'Italian', 'lover', 'deeply', 'infatuated', 'employ', 'secretly', 'delivering', 'documents', 'would', 'allow', 'Jewish', 'recipients', 'flee', 'country.I', 'was', 'especially', 'taken', 'character', 'Mary', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'able', 'perceive', 'what', 'was', 'right', 'wrong', 'acted', 'worked', 'good', 'sphere', 'influence', 'strength', 'moral', 'courage', 'gentleness', 'made', 'quite', 'difference', 'young', 'Luca', 'was', 'wise', 'enough', 'usually', 'pay', 'attention', 'Even', 'had', 'gone', 'off', 'school', 'returned', 'fully', 'grown', 'Mary', 'did', 'not', 'hold', 'back', 'correcting', 'when', 'behaved', 'badly', 'became', 'cross', 'when', 'youthful', 'jealousy', 'blinded', 'even', 'so', 'reprimand', 'offered', 'what', 'needed', 'not', 'just', 'understand', 'was', 'wrong', 'what', 'must', 'do', 'correct', 'course', 'What', 'are', 'hurt', 'feelings', 'when', 'are', 'lives', 'stake', 'Rather', 'stupidly', 'insisting', 'pursuing', 'misstep', 'Luca', 'wisely', 'took', 'lesson', 'not', 'only', 'quit', 'complaining', 'being', 'Elsa', 'messenger', 'boy', 'also', 'used', 'money', 'Elsa', 'had', 'years', 'earlier', 'put', 'trust', 'help', 'resistance', 'get', 'Elsa', 'safety', 'when', 'life', 'was', 'danger', 'When', 'resistance', 'asked', 'where', 'got', 'money', 'told', 'Wilfred', 'Random', 'Lady', 'Hester', 'grandson', 'money', 'was', 'intended', 'help', 'grow', 'up', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'very', 'much', 'forgot', 'first', 'rule', 'gentleman', 'love', 'last', 'reference', 'Shakespeare', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'reminded', 'wonderful', 'scene', 'earlier', 'when', 'Mary', 'used', 'Shakespeare', 'entertain', 'teach', 'young', 'boy', 'guidance', 'corrected', 'action', 'Luca', 'set', 'aside', 'whatever', 'inconvenience', 'heartache', 'had', 'moving', 'taking', 'action', 'intended', 'more', 'just', 'feel', 'good', 'have', 'fun', 'adhere', 'principle', 'was', 'important', 'one', 'was', 'instilled', 'presume', 'Mary', 'Wallace', 'had', 'impact', 'was', 'concrete', 'specific', 'saved', 'life', 'woman', 'generosity', 'fortune', 'allowed', 'be', 'educated', 'raised', 'relative', 'comfort', 'acted', 'well', 'moment', 'Johann', 'Kaspar', 'said', 'performed', 'good', 'action', 'eternity', 'Would', 'others', 'thus', 'behaved', 'what', 'atrocities', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'avoided.Tea', 'Mussolini', 'delight', 'story', 'worthy', 'consideration', 'immensely', 'pleasurable', 'watch']",N/A

My husband and I saw it on the big screen and then bought the DVD. Although it is a &quot;chick flick&quot; Cher's presence  kept my husband  interested. At one point in the story, Cher is asked. &quot;Are all women  in America like you?&quot; (The setting of the film is Italy.) She turns to  the camera and says, &quot;Alas, NO.&quot;  The audience cracked up at this  remark because she is unique even to Americans. I love Cher, and I adore  Maggie Smith and Judy Denton. I last saw Maggie and Judy together in  &quot;Room With A View&quot; another film shot in Italy.The story line  is simple. A group of female English citizens, long-time residents of  Italy, stay on after Mussolini takes control although there are indications  they may be imperiling their lives. The women choose to see him as a  benevolent dictator, simply restoring order to a disorganized people. As  his takeover unfolds, the lives of these English ex-pats becomes more and  more difficult. Those who have been working lose their jobs. All of them  lose the right to move freely, shop, travel etc. These restrictions  noticably mirror the treatment of the Jews.  Finally, the group decides to  meet with Mussolini and talk about their problems. Maggie Smith, widow of  the former English ambassador, plans a tea with Mussolini. At the tea, the  women fail to understand Mussolini is merely patronizing them, and stalling  for time. Their lives continue to deteriorate, especially after England  declares war on the Axis. Eventually, the women are rounded up and herded  into what must be the most beautiful detention center ever--an old  fortress-castle on a remote hill in northern Italy. They stay there until  the liberation at the end of the war.The humor in this film is  reminiscent of &quot;Life is Beautiful.&quot;  One learns to laugh at the  enemy to survive.  I will never forget an interview Art Linkletter held  with a Jewish survivor of the concentration camps who had written a book on  humor. (Linkletter was the Donahue of the 1960's). When Art asked the man  how he survived the camps, he said &quot;I always focused on how stupid  those soldiers looked prancing around in their shiny uniforms while we  stood before them looking like a clutch of plucked chickens.&quot;The  plot of &quot;Tea&quot; is similar to &quot;Life&quot; except instead of a  concentration camp, the prisoners are held in an old fortress, and instead  of a group of men hiding a child, a group of women are hiding a Jewess.  There are many humorous scenes as the women prisoners outfox the stupid  Italian facist soldiers guarding them. Their ultimate coup is to protect  and hide Cher who is not only an American, but Jewish.This is a great  DVD, buy it.",5,Cher and Maggie Smith?,958867200,"05 21, 2000",2000,2801,"['meant', 'write', 'something', 'earlier', 'film', 'really', 'husband', 'saw', 'big', 'screen', 'then', 'bought', 'DVD', 'quot', 'flick', 'quot', 'Cher', 'presence', 'kept', 'husband', 'interested', 'one', 'point', 'story', 'Cher', 'asked', 'quot', 'Are', 'women', 'America', 'quot', 'setting', 'film', 'Italy', 'camera', 'quot', 'Alas', 'NO.', 'quot', 'audience', 'cracked', 'up', 'remark', 'unique', 'even', 'Americans', 'love', 'Cher', 'adore', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Judy', 'Denton', 'last', 'saw', 'Maggie', 'Judy', 'together', 'quot', 'Room', 'A', 'View', 'quot', 'film', 'shot', 'Italy.The', 'story', 'line', 'simple', 'group', 'female', 'English', 'citizens', 'long-time', 'residents', 'Italy', 'stay', 'Mussolini', 'control', 'are', 'indications', 'may', 'be', 'imperiling', 'lives', 'women', 'choose', 'see', 'benevolent', 'dictator', 'simply', 'restoring', 'order', 'disorganized', 'people', 'takeover', 'unfolds', 'lives', 'English', 'ex-pats', 'more', 'more', 'difficult', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'working', 'lose', 'jobs', 'lose', 'right', 'move', 'freely', 'shop', 'travel', 'etc', 'restrictions', 'noticably', 'mirror', 'treatment', 'Jews', 'Finally', 'group', 'meet', 'Mussolini', 'talk', 'problems', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'widow', 'former', 'English', 'ambassador', 'tea', 'Mussolini', 'tea', 'women', 'fail', 'understand', 'Mussolini', 'merely', 'patronizing', 'stalling', 'time', 'lives', 'continue', 'deteriorate', 'especially', 'England', 'war', 'Axis', 'Eventually', 'women', 'are', 'rounded', 'up', 'herded', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'most', 'beautiful', 'detention', 'center', 'ever', 'old', 'fortress-castle', 'remote', 'hill', 'northern', 'Italy', 'stay', 'there', 'liberation', 'end', 'war.The', 'humor', 'film', 'reminiscent', 'quot', 'Life', 'Beautiful.', 'quot', 'laugh', 'enemy', 'survive', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'interview', 'Art', 'Linkletter', 'held', 'Jewish', 'survivor', 'concentration', 'camps', 'who', 'had', 'written', 'book', 'humor', 'Linkletter', 'was', 'Donahue', '1960', 'When', 'Art', 'asked', 'man', 'how', 'survived', 'camps', 'said', 'quot', 'always', 'focused', 'how', 'stupid', 'soldiers', 'looked', 'prancing', 'around', 'shiny', 'uniforms', 'stood', 'looking', 'clutch', 'plucked', 'chickens.', 'quot', 'plot', 'quot', 'Tea', 'quot', 'similar', 'quot', 'Life', 'quot', 'instead', 'concentration', 'camp', 'prisoners', 'are', 'held', 'old', 'fortress', 'instead', 'group', 'men', 'hiding', 'child', 'group', 'women', 'are', 'hiding', 'Jewess', 'are', 'many', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'women', 'prisoners', 'outfox', 'stupid', 'Italian', 'facist', 'soldiers', 'guarding', 'ultimate', 'coup', 'protect', 'hide', 'Cher', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'American', 'Jewish.This', 'great', 'DVD', 'buy']",N/A

Unlike it's Parisian counterpart, which produced some of the most important writers and artists of the Twentieth Century, the Florentine colony was more focused on sex, parties, and back-biting gossip and this comes across fairly well in the movie, where the ladies portray dangerously naive socialites drifting through lives of splendid idleness, utterly blind to the idea that Western Civilization is about to go over a cliff.  To them, Mussolini is a welcome breath of order, and for a while, their protector, not the thug that he and his fascist goons actually were.  Needless to say, this aspect of the film doesn't end well.  We mock these women at our peril though, as our own government's policies in the Middle East are having consequences that are pushing us towards war, and most Americans are no more informed than these women.  it could be said that we are having tea with our own Mussolini...With Maggie Smith and Judi Dench  in the cast, comparisons to Merchant-Ivory's ""A Room With A View"" and ""Downton Abbey"" are inevitable.  Of the three, I think this film is the least convincing in setting it's period.  To me, much of the film seems to be a period costume performance in Florence, than a depiction of 1940's Florence.  That said, it's a Zefferelli film, and it is pretty to look at.  The costumes are gorgeous, and it shows some good shots of Florence streets and piazzas.While I purchased this film, it was more as a ""souvenir"" of Florence---had it taken place elsewhere, I probably would not have made such a commitment.  I recommend this as a rental.  The problem is, you can't.  Not on Amazon or Netflix-Streaming.  It's not available.  I had to go to VuDu to watch it.  Sadly, our rapid acceptance of new technology has sunk much of the video rental business before the Studios and Streamers have worked out the copyright details and thus, all too often, gaps appear, with few brick and mortar options available to fill the void.

The group of English women will not leave Florece even in the face of an impeding war; Lady Hester, in her naivete assumes that tea with Mussolini will guarantee her and her friends' safety.The film is a little predictable and somewhat rosy. On the other hand, If Luca is based on Zeffirelli, he obviously lived to tell his tale so perhaps this rosiness is justified. Cher seems to play Cher and isn't terribly convincing as a rich Jewish American; and her wardrobe is gaudy enough to belong to her. On the other hand, the three British actresses are great, particularly Maggie Smith who cannot abide Americans. My favorite line of hers is that Americans [referring to Elsa] can even &quot;vulgarize&quot; ice cream.Of course it's impossible to make an ugly movie that's filmed in Florence; this one is no exception.

It's home to them!The ladies have a small close community and a few of them become involved with Luca, who is the illegitimate son of a local man.  After his mother dies, he's placed in an orphanage. The ladies are Mary (Joan Plowright), Arabella (Judi Dench) and Hester ( Maggie Smith), and all help to care for the boy in some way. Because Hester is the widow of an English statesman, she  tries to dominate the other ladies, but they can usually ignore her snobbish ways. The English ladies are also assisted by two American friends. Elsa (Cher), plays the part of a wealthy art lover from America and quietly fiances Luca's education.

It was particularlymuch less racist, being colored by the multiethnic backgroundof the Italians themselves.So politically, Britain was not initially fearful of Mussolini.There was also a prevailing attitude of condescension towardItaly and its people before the war. Many Britains thoughtthat 'having the trains run on time' was just what thebenighted Italians needed.So the diplomatic shock is mirrored in the small world of ladiesliving on their trusts in Florence. They deny, they cope,and ultimately they respond with  noblesse oblige and courage.There are some fine performances here. Judy Dench is such agood actress that she's past acting. The show however, isstolen by Cher who belies her pop-star/campy image withanother smart and sensitive interpretation of a character.Some critics have objected that she was merely playing herself,but what a self to play!The story is just a bit sappy and also a bit calculated, butthis is a beautiful movie-a feast for the eyes and a reminderof the dangers of taking things at face value.--Lynn Hoffman, author of THE NEW SHORT COURSE IN WINE  andthe novel bang BANG.

470394,A319KYEIAZ3SON,6305600953,Mary Whipple,"[10, 11]","Directed by Franco Zeffirelli, who also wrote the screenplay with John Mortimer, this (1999) semi-autobiographical tale revolves around an illegitimate Italian child named Luca, whose wealthy father provides financial support but otherwise ignores him.  Taken under the wing of Mary Wallace (Joan Plowright), one of a group of British women who have remained in Italy during the rule of Mussolini, he learns English and enjoys the only stability he has ever known.  When Italy allies itself with Germany, his father sends him off to school in Germany, but Luca remains close to ""Miss Mary.""Lady Hester Random (Maggie Smith), artist Arabella (Judi Dench), and several other expatriots, are all in Mary Wallace's very British social circle.  Under Lady Hester's direction, they are insulated, self-satisfied, and exclusive, and regard people like Elsa Morganthau-Strauss, an American parvenu and art-collector (Cher), as beneath them. She mockingly refers to them as the ""scorpioni,"" an opinion shared by Georgie, an American  archaeologist (Lily Tomlin).  When the fascists threaten their lifestyle, Lady Hester, widow of the former ambassador, has tea with Mussolini, who promises to look after her and her friends personally.  When war breaks out, however, promises are broken, and it is up to Luca, back from Germany, to try to help.The level of irony is suggested in the title, as the ""scorpioni"" refuse to believe that Mussolini's ""ungentlemanly"" behavior could possibly affect them.  Zeffirelli, alternates semi-serious scenes with extravagant, absurd scenes, much like the comic relief of the Shakespearean plays he has also directed, and he casts the film so that each of his stars plays to type--Maggie Smith as the hopelessly snobby aristocrat, Judi Dench as a fey and flighty artiste, Joan Plowright as the sweet and thoughtful grandmotherly sort, Cher as the most extravagant and crass American ever filmed, and Lily Tomlin as the no-nonsense realist who enjoys sticking pins into those who puff themselves up.  The roles do not call for subtlety or originality, but it is great fun to watch these screen legends having fun here.The gorgeous scenery, art, and architecture of Tuscany are well filmed by David Watkin, and the tone of the film remains light, focusing on the women and Luca almost exclusively. A satiric tale poking fun at everything from American crassness and British class-consciousness to the absurdities of Mussolini's pretentions, the film virtually ignores fascism's serious realities for the sake of the story line and its humor.

470395,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305600953,Matthew Horner,"[7, 7]","Tea With Mussolini is director Franco Zefferilli's partly autobiographical account of the experiences of a boy named Luca in Fascist Italy. The story begins just before German declares war on Poland in 1939 and ends with the liberation of Italy by the Allied Forces in 1944. During the Second World War, Italy's dictator, Mussolini, was allied with Hitler's Nazi Germany. England and France declared war on both counties in 1939, and by late 1941, America had done the same. Prior to the war, there were numerous British and American expatriates who lived permanently abroad. Many of these lived in small colonies in Italy. Not political by nature, many of these people paid scant attention to the growing threat of war. As a result, they went from privileged people with very pleasant lives to prisoners of war.It is in this unstable and dangerous situation that we find young Luca. He is the illegitimate son of an Italian clothing merchant and a dress maker. When his mother dies, Luca put is in a school. His father is too concerned about his marriage and his social position to have much concern. His nominal guardian is the middle-aged Mary [Joan Plowright], an English employee of his father's. As Luca's situation continues to deteriorate, Mary finds herself more or less stuck with the child. She loves him, but she's a spinster and feels unable to cope with the task. She turns to some of her female British friends, and they all set out to raise him. When the war breaks out, this becomes an almost insurmountable problem when the ladies lose all rights and freedoms.There are those who have found the plot to be both improbably and somewhat maudlin. I don't disagree entirely, but I find that Tea With Mussolini's assets far outweigh these issues. Cher, Judi Dench, Joan Plowright, Maggie Smith and Lili Tomlin are all successful, talented and seasoned actresses. Between them, they have four Oscar wins, seven nominations, and 187 film roles. To see these women together in the same movie is, to me, well worth the price of admission. They are as good at comedy as they are at drama, and they bring to the film a sense of humor that offsets what might have been a rather dark tale. All can take the most mundane line and give it life. Each can say volumes with a simple glance. Cher is especially good as an American heiress, although this is a painful reminder that she hasn't done much with her film career since Moonstruck in 1987. The other ladies have been continuously active.The film's other marvel is David Watkin's extraordinary photography. We often go to a movie and note the visual impact of two or three scenes - Jim Carey's saying good morning to the camera in The Truman Show, young Forrest Gump's leg braces falling away as he runs from the bullies, the Normandy Invasion in Saving Private Ryan, etc. But Watkins gives us scores of memorable shots. He makes Tea With Mussolini almost too beautiful, if that is possible. He has more than a creative talent with cameras. He has utter confidence and authority.

Even from the title you sometimes get a notion about the film itself. I'm not sure how true that is of ""Tea with Mussolini,"" for other  viewers, but I found myself drawn to this movie the first time someone  said, ""Have you seen..."" I thought: there's a good idea. And I finally got  around to seeing it.Well, it's a wonderful movie, for all sorts of  reasons. I love films set in a certain period - not too far away, mind you  (unless we're talking ""Braveheart"" or King Arthur), but fifty or so years  ago, at least. Among other recent films, I'm thinking of ""The English  Patient"" and ""A Room with a View"" I suppose, as I write that. They are both  great period pieces and happily, fine cinema as well. This was no  exception. Once again, English social habits were put under a spotlight,  and this time one of the main sub-plots turned upon the difference in  attitude of the staid old English and those brash young things, only a few  centuries old, the Americans. What a discovery this particular American was  for me. Cher played the part of the rather loud New York jewess to  perfection. When it came to the d&eacute;nouement, she was equally good at playing  a more refined, withdrawn role, of a woman about to escape from mortal  danger. For though the film has its light side, we are nevertheless in a  war zone, accompanying a group of female detainees who decided not to quit  Il Duce's domain until it was too late.It's a film that not only shows  us people failing to get on together in easy circumstances; it also shows  us that they can learn to cooperate across the silliest of imagined  boundaries once things start hotting up.

It's a comical but inspiring scene when our happy band stands up to the Germans.What's more, the sense of time and place is impeccable. Italy itself is practically a character. Expect travelogue-worthy shots of Florence. The calendar says 1935, that haunting time of a Europe sandwiched between the wars. Even before the first sounding of tanks or dictators, in every word and deed there is just the slightest trace of irresolution, an uneasiness.Impatient viewers stand warned: this is a mood piece that unravels quite leisurely, meanders almost, using its entire first half for character exposition and sowing little story details.

Luca, an illegitimate child, unwanted by his father, is raised by the loving and patient Mary Wallace who is helped by a group of English ladies. Luca's father has a notion of making him ""an English Gentlemen"", a notion that soon changes according to the new political winds to become a wish of making him a ""German businessman"".... We meet the ""Scorpions"", a group of British ladies living in pre world war II Florence, headed by Maggie Smith who plays the widow of the British Ambassador - as she never fails to remind everyone. Scorpions is a nickname invented by Elsa, a rich American performer (Cher) who both laughs at and likes the group. Elsa becomes the benefactor of Luca and opens a trust for him, a favor he will return in the years to come.I confess that the mixture of Italian charm with British ladies usually works for me and any film bringing us this excellent group of actors cannot be bad. However, ""Tea with Mussolini"" is not always credible and the characters are somewhat exaggerated.  The war remains in the background, as something nor the ladies nor the viewers are able to fully grasp. The ladies would not leave Italy due to their love of the place and their nave belief in Mussolini and an effort is made to show how their lives are affected. We are supposed to understand the dreadfulness of war from the cruel separation of one British lady from her dog, or from the fact that they are supposed to sleep in a dirty crowded place. On the other hand, an effort is made to show the viewers that the ladies ""cannot be given orders"". I do wish that would have been true at times of wars.  Not very convincing. However, if not taken as a true picture of reality the movie can be quite enjoyable.",3,Great actors. Lovely Italy.

The movie is really a great vehicle  for Cher to show her fashionable side and her work as Elsa the jewish  bohemian is akin to Auntie Mame as she shows the young director how to  live. This movie was a great crowd pleaser, though overlooked by the  academy this year. The scorpioni were perhaps too cute, and facism was  maybe too much a cartoon to tell the story with complete authority. We must  remember that it is from the point of view of a very young person, so  perhaps the overview would be less political. Franco has made a great movie  here even if it is perhaps too mild.
