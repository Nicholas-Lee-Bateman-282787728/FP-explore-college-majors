339882,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,6302824710,Get What We Give,"[3, 5]","Band of the Hand is one of those movies that you can watch as a time capsule of teen-focused films of the 1980's.  Rather than focus on the angst of upper middle class kids and their love lives, Band of the Hand looks at the criminal element of the era.  Directed by Paul Michael Glaser (Starsky and Hutch) and produced by Michael Mann (Miami Vice), this film is more visual than visceral.  The premise is only slightly realistic (and only more recently so, as rehab programs vaguely similar have cropped up in the 90's), but it's fun to watch.The characters are sinister bad boys, but not so much so that you can't love them.  There's the drop dead handsome drug dealer, a new wave looking kid who committed patricide (but only because the guy beat his mother and sister), two gang members (one Puerto Rican and one black), and a rough uneducated car thief.We see these boys commit their crimes and then get busted - all done in a very Miami Vice sort of way.  They are all relegated to a new experimental rehab program that involves them surviving on their own in the everglades.  If they graduate (which you know they will) they'll move into a really rough area of Miami and learn to live in the city.Not only do these boys succeed, they do so with flying colors.  Rehab is a wonderful thing!  This is obviously a liberal conscience at work - none the less it is fun to watch.I won't spoil the film (because I do enjoy the film even if it is trite and overly empathetic to the characters), but suffice it to say there is a lot of excitement and eventually - intrigue and action in this film.My complaint is that the film is very uneven.  It seems to be bits of several films stuck together.  There's a sense of a three act play at work - and the third act is where the fun is.The acting is good and the interaction of the young and older actors is believable, even if the script is silly.In the end, you'll enjoy this bit of escapist 80's fun.",3,Great 80's time capsule even if it's not great,1070496000,"12 4, 2003",2003,1946,"['Band', 'Hand', 'one', 'movies', 'can', 'watch', 'time', 'capsule', 'teen-focused', 'films', '1980', 'focus', 'angst', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'kids', 'love', 'lives', 'Band', 'Hand', 'criminal', 'element', 'era', 'Directed', 'Paul', 'Michael', 'Glaser', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'produced', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'film', 'more', 'visual', 'visceral', 'premise', 'only', 'slightly', 'realistic', 'only', 'more', 'recently', 'so', 'rehab', 'programs', 'vaguely', 'similar', 'have', 'cropped', 'up', '90', 'fun', 'watch.The', 'characters', 'are', 'sinister', 'bad', 'boys', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'ca', ""n't"", 'love', 'drop', 'dead', 'handsome', 'drug', 'dealer', 'new', 'wave', 'looking', 'kid', 'who', 'committed', 'patricide', 'only', 'guy', 'beat', 'mother', 'sister', 'two', 'gang', 'members', 'one', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'one', 'black', 'rough', 'uneducated', 'car', 'thief.We', 'see', 'boys', 'commit', 'crimes', 'then', 'get', 'busted', 'done', 'very', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'sort', 'way', 'are', 'relegated', 'new', 'experimental', 'rehab', 'program', 'surviving', 'own', 'everglades', 'graduate', 'know', 'will', ""'ll"", 'move', 'really', 'rough', 'area', 'Miami', 'learn', 'live', 'city.Not', 'only', 'do', 'boys', 'succeed', 'do', 'so', 'flying', 'colors', 'Rehab', 'wonderful', 'thing', 'obviously', 'liberal', 'conscience', 'work', 'none', 'less', 'fun', 'watch.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'film', 'do', 'enjoy', 'film', 'even', 'trite', 'overly', 'empathetic', 'characters', 'say', 'lot', 'excitement', 'eventually', 'intrigue', 'action', 'film.My', 'complaint', 'film', 'very', 'uneven', 'be', 'bits', 'several', 'films', 'stuck', 'together', 'sense', 'three', 'act', 'play', 'work', 'third', 'act', 'where', 'fun', 'is.The', 'acting', 'good', 'interaction', 'young', 'older', 'actors', 'believable', 'even', 'script', 'end', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'bit', 'escapist', '80', 'fun']",N/A
