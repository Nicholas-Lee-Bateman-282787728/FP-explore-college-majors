1016488,ACX58BUBALHFV,B000HT3Q2I,Andrew Bauer,"[4, 4]","Quantum Leap is by far one of the best TV series of the 80's and early 90's, and in my humble opinion, one of the better shows in the past 30 years. It managed, without gratuitous sex, nudity, or cursing to present a wonderful show that the whole family could watch, and tackled many issues head-on (racism, sexism, the Vietnam War, etc.) And the whole theme of the show--someone putting right what once went wrong--was perfect, and was very inspirational. In this 5th and final season, you get to see some of the best episodes of the series, and some of the most memorable. I have seen the comments by others on the final episode, and how it ended things abruptly, but I beg to differ. I thought it was a perfect wrap-up to a series that (thankfully) didn't try to overstay its welcome. Many other series have tried to push their lifespans to the point where they're not fresh anymore--but not Quantum Leap. Other series never get the chance to wrap up before they're cancelled (especially these days--how'd you like the endings to Joan Of Arcadia and Tru Calling? Oops, forgot--they didn't have one). Quantum Leap not only got to wrap things up, they did so in the most memorable of fashions. This is a gem of a series, and this final season is the sparkle in that gem.",5,One of the best 80's shows comes to a close...,1254441600,"10 2, 2009",2009,1271,"['Quantum', 'Leap', 'far', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'series', '80', 'early', '90', 'humble', 'opinion', 'one', 'better', 'shows', 'past', '30', 'years', 'managed', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'nudity', 'cursing', 'present', 'wonderful', 'show', 'whole', 'family', 'could', 'watch', 'tackled', 'many', 'issues', 'head-on', 'racism', 'sexism', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'etc', 'whole', 'theme', 'show', 'someone', 'putting', 'right', 'what', 'once', 'went', 'wrong', 'was', 'perfect', 'was', 'very', 'inspirational', '5th', 'final', 'season', 'get', 'see', 'best', 'episodes', 'series', 'most', 'memorable', 'have', 'seen', 'comments', 'others', 'final', 'episode', 'how', 'ended', 'things', 'abruptly', 'beg', 'differ', 'thought', 'was', 'perfect', 'wrap-up', 'series', 'thankfully', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'overstay', 'welcome', 'Many', 'other', 'series', 'have', 'tried', 'push', 'lifespans', 'point', 'where', ""'re"", 'not', 'fresh', 'anymore', 'not', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'Other', 'series', 'never', 'get', 'chance', 'wrap', 'up', ""'re"", 'cancelled', 'especially', 'days', 'how', ""'d"", 'endings', 'Joan', 'Arcadia', 'Tru', 'Calling', 'Oops', 'forgot', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'not', 'only', 'got', 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'did', 'so', 'most', 'memorable', 'fashions', 'gem', 'series', 'final', 'season', 'sparkle', 'gem']",Quantum Leap: The Complete Fifth Season

WHAT NOW?!!!OK, yes I do know how I feel. It's been a long haul. It didn't take me long to watch the first three seasons, the fourth season was a pain in the neck, and then the fifth season seemed to be over in a flash. I watched eight episodes during a two day period, and then today, I watched the last two discs straight through. I did consider rationing it, maybe watching an episode a week, but I don't think the person I borrowed it from is too happy at the gap in his DVD case. Didn't think it would be a good idea to risk it, never mind joke about it.I'm still actually in shock over the last episode, Mirror Image. I'm totally gutted it's over, there's no more Sam, there's no more Al. And what a gripping final episode. From the blurb, I thought it would work slightly differently. I thought it would be he went back to where he was born, and do something there. Kinda like the end of the director's cut of Butterfly Effect. But although it was a disappointing ending (there's rumours it was meant to be a two parter, or a cliffhanger to the sixth season, which of course, never happened, as it was cancelled in its prime!), it totally gripped me, and I think I sat there with my jaw on the floor when the credits rolled. I won't give away anything about the final episode, but OH MY GOD, get some tissues beside you, cos I started crying. Hey I started crying when Sam started crying - I'm a sucker for guy's crying. I bawled my eyes out so much the first two times I watched Armageddon (when Ben Affleck starts crying), I actually missed the ending!The rest of the season was an alright ending to a brilliant show. The double whammy episode at the beginning, where Sam leaps into Lee Harvey Oswald, was a major disappointment, and thankfully, it didn't start the very first season, cos there's no way I would have gone on to continue watching it. I'm too young to know all the conspiracy theories surrounding JFK & Lee Harvey Oswald, and I've never really had an interest in finding out more, so this episode just didn't work for me. Sure it fascinated Donald P whatshisface, and he just had to make an episode about it, but not for me.My other favourite episodes include:Brook Shields appearing in Leaping Of The Shrew, as the spoiled brat stranded on a desert island with Sam - she was absolutely hilarious, but I doubt she was meant to be.Killin' Time - we got to see more of the present time in Al's world, as Sam leaps into a serial killer, who then promptly escapes in 1999, and Al has to catch him.The Trilogy arc was a brilliant way to stop the show from getting too much the same, as Sam leaps about into three different people on one person's life. Some reviewers haven't liked this as much, but I certainly did, so much so that I watched the three in a row, with the previous two.Deliver Us From Evil was brilliant, as it went back to someone Sam had previously leaped into, little Jimmy the Downs syndrome boy, but then introduced the concept of an evil leaper to Sam's good. To be honest, I did consider that they should have introduced this sooner, because everyone has their nemesis, but I was disappointed, because that's where Tru Calling seemed to have their Tru & Jack storyline from!Return Of The Evil Leaper, and Revenge Of The Evil Leaper were good, but just not as good as I thought they'd be. There's eight episodes between Deliver Us From Evil & Return Of The Evil Leaper, I think they should have brought it about sooner, instead of just reintroducing the concept again randomly.Goodbye Norma Jean was another brilliant episode, with Sam playing Marilyn Monroe's chauffeur. I didn't think the actress playing Marilyn was that great a lookalike, but she did the job I guess.I do wish they'd bring back Quantum Leap, especially since it will be coming up for its twentieth anniversary in two years. It would be nice to see the show more resolved than it was (like Tru Calling!), and lets face it, Scott Bakula and Dean Stockwell are still a) alive and b) Scott has NOT changed in the slightest.

Although it has many episodes that have been panned for being laden with celebrity leaps (Elvis, Marilyn Monroe, JFK, etc.) and for having the silly Evil Leaper episodes (which I LOVED, by the way) overall, it is a fantastic season. The Trilogy eps are by FAR the highlight of the season. Also a neat thing about this season: we get to see more of the inner workings of Project Quantum Leap in ""Killin' Time"" and ""Lee Harvey Oswald"". The stories spend a lot of time at the physical Project Quantum Leap underground building in New Mexico in the ""future"" with Al and the person Sam has leapt into for reasons I won't go into so I don't spoil anything for anyone who hasn't seen them yet. It's really fun getting to see what the room where the Leap-ees stay in looks like as well as other parts of the Project!I highly recommend this season above any others, except for maybe the very short first season.With that said, I of course have not watched any of them on the DVD because as of right now, it has not been released yet, so I can't review the DVD versions of the eps. On DVD releases of previous seasons, Universal has made several glaring changes to many very important episodes in the way of music/soundtrack songs which was VERY disappointing for HUGE long time QL fans like myself. I've heard that there will be no changes to the Elvis music since it is such an integral aspect of that particular episode. I really Really hope that there will be SOMETHING in the way of extras, which have been sorely lacking on previous seasons.And just FYI: that Scott Bakula rumor about him returning to the small screen for a new QL series is just that -- a RUMOR. It is not fact; SB himself has repeatedly denied any involvement in any new series since the end of ST:Ent. IMDB.com has the series listed as In Development, but it's been in that status for literally YEARS and no stars are attached to appear.

It is a bitter sweet release knowing that there are no further adventures, other than the ones you can imagine up on your own if you are so inclined, of Sam Becket and his helpers Al and computer AI Ziggy.Some of what I consider the best episodes in the entire 5 season run are contained in this release. The Evil Leaper episodes and the final episode, which I actually liked only because it wasn't the ""happy ending"" most American made features contain. Or in the case of some TV series, they never have a conclusion at all and are left open ended because ratings weren't high enough to justify continuing.I personally dislike double sided discs as they are more easily damaged, and that is what this series consists of, just as previous seasons were. Thin pack cases are a plus as this set of 3 discs takes up the space on the shelf of more like 2 normal sized DVD releases.If you're new to the series this is definitely not the place to start. Sure you have the short bits at the beginning of each episode to tell you how it all started, but this compressed time line is nowhere near enough to connect you to Sam and Al. They can be enjoyed without the background (let's face it, the premise doesn't really change from episode to episode, but for some reason it just works) but I recommend at least viewing the first season before jumping to this set if you're unfamiliar with the series.Very good release.",5,Bitter sweet,1167868800,"01 4, 2007",2007,1464,"['long', 'last', 'DVD', 'run', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'completed', 'bitter', 'sweet', 'release', 'knowing', 'are', 'further', 'adventures', 'other', 'ones', 'can', 'imagine', 'up', 'own', 'are', 'so', 'inclined', 'Sam', 'Becket', 'helpers', 'Al', 'computer', 'AI', 'Ziggy.Some', 'what', 'consider', 'best', 'episodes', 'entire', '5', 'season', 'run', 'are', 'contained', 'release', 'Evil', 'Leaper', 'episodes', 'final', 'episode', 'actually', 'liked', 'only', 'was', ""n't"", 'happy', 'ending', 'most', 'American', 'made', 'features', 'contain', 'case', 'TV', 'series', 'never', 'have', 'conclusion', 'are', 'left', 'open', 'ended', 'because', 'ratings', 'were', ""n't"", 'high', 'enough', 'justify', 'continuing.I', 'personally', 'double', 'sided', 'discs', 'are', 'more', 'easily', 'damaged', 'what', 'series', 'just', 'previous', 'seasons', 'were', 'Thin', 'pack', 'cases', 'are', 'set', '3', 'discs', 'up', 'space', 'shelf', 'more', '2', 'normal', 'sized', 'DVD', 'releases.If', ""'re"", 'new', 'series', 'definitely', 'not', 'place', 'start', 'Sure', 'have', 'short', 'bits', 'beginning', 'episode', 'tell', 'how', 'started', 'compressed', 'time', 'line', 'nowhere', 'near', 'enough', 'connect', 'Sam', 'Al', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'background', 'let', 'face', 'premise', ""n't"", 'really', 'change', 'episode', 'episode', 'reason', 'just', 'recommend', 'least', 'viewing', 'first', 'season', 'jumping', 'set', ""'re"", 'unfamiliar', 'series.Very', 'good', 'release']",Quantum Leap: The Complete Fifth Season

""Quantum Leap"" didn't and that's a rarity. The final season looks very good in its presentation on DVD and, while I haven't ploughed through every episode yet it appears that the music hasn't been replaced in the ones I've watched. There's also no notification about the music being replaced (as on the third and fourth season the second doesn't count because Universal hoodwinked everyone on that one). We also get an actual extra in this set--the blue prints for two sets in the show. You can actually zoom in on separate sections to view them.This episode features a number of classic ones including the one where Sam encounters the ""Evil Leaper"" in a terrific two part episode. Also, Sam becomes ""the King"" (Elvis) just before he breaks through to the big time and in the most fascinating of the episodes written by Donald Bellasario Sam becomes Lee Harvey Oswald (played by character actor Willie Garson best known for ""Sex and the City""). Sam and Al struggle to find out why he's leaping in and out of Oswald throughout the time leading up to the assassination of Kennedy. Here's where a great extra could have been included by Universal as Bellasario actually knew Oswald and served in the military with him (an actor plays Bellasario recreating their first meeting).Now for a bit of  bad news--we get the series once again on dual sided discs. Unlike some previous sets from Universal I haven't had a problem with these so far so maybe they've finally figured out how to make the darn things properly. Luckily these aren't packaged facing each other (like many of the Fox dual sided discs) but in individual slimline cases.Unlike many fans of the series I disliked the resolution in the final episode of the fifth season and had hoped for something less open ended. It would have allowed a terrific TV movie to tie things up but unfortunately it never happened. I'm not going to say anything else for those who haven't seen the final episode. Some great guest stars during the fifth season--Neil Patrick Harris, Brooke Shields (even though I think she's a horrible actress normally she does a solid job here), Dr. Ruth, Terry Farrell, John Hillard, Michael Boatman, Stephen Root and a young Jennifer Aniston in one episode.The show goes out in style with some of the best episodes of the series.",5,"The final season of ""Quantum Leap"" goes out at the top",1163462400,"11 14, 2006",2006,2367,"['Almost', 'TV', 'show', 'welcome', 'shark', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'did', ""n't"", 'rarity', 'final', 'season', 'very', 'good', 'presentation', 'DVD', 'have', ""n't"", 'ploughed', 'episode', 'yet', 'music', ""n't"", 'been', 'replaced', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'also', 'notification', 'music', 'being', 'replaced', 'third', 'fourth', 'season', 'second', ""n't"", 'count', 'because', 'Universal', 'hoodwinked', 'everyone', 'one', 'also', 'get', 'actual', 'extra', 'set', 'blue', 'prints', 'two', 'sets', 'show', 'can', 'actually', 'zoom', 'separate', 'sections', 'view', 'them.This', 'episode', 'number', 'classic', 'ones', 'including', 'one', 'where', 'Sam', 'Evil', 'Leaper', 'terrific', 'two', 'part', 'episode', 'Also', 'Sam', 'King', 'Elvis', 'just', 'big', 'time', 'most', 'fascinating', 'episodes', 'written', 'Donald', 'Bellasario', 'Sam', 'Lee', 'Harvey', 'Oswald', 'played', 'character', 'actor', 'Willie', 'Garson', 'best', 'known', 'Sex', 'City', 'Sam', 'Al', 'struggle', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'leaping', 'Oswald', 'time', 'leading', 'up', 'assassination', 'Kennedy', 'Here', 'where', 'great', 'extra', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'Universal', 'Bellasario', 'actually', 'knew', 'Oswald', 'served', 'military', 'actor', 'Bellasario', 'recreating', 'first', 'meeting', '.Now', 'bit', 'bad', 'news', 'get', 'series', 'once', 'again', 'dual', 'sided', 'discs', 'previous', 'sets', 'Universal', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'problem', 'so', 'far', 'so', 'maybe', ""'ve"", 'finally', 'figured', 'out', 'how', 'make', 'darn', 'things', 'properly', 'Luckily', 'are', ""n't"", 'packaged', 'facing', 'other', 'many', 'Fox', 'dual', 'sided', 'discs', 'individual', 'slimline', 'cases.Unlike', 'many', 'fans', 'series', 'disliked', 'resolution', 'final', 'episode', 'fifth', 'season', 'had', 'hoped', 'something', 'open', 'ended', 'would', 'have', 'allowed', 'terrific', 'TV', 'movie', 'tie', 'things', 'up', 'unfortunately', 'never', 'happened', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'say', 'anything', 'else', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'final', 'episode', 'great', 'guest', 'stars', 'fifth', 'season', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'Brooke', 'Shields', 'even', 'think', 'horrible', 'actress', 'normally', 'solid', 'job', 'here', 'Dr.', 'Ruth', 'Terry', 'Farrell', 'John', 'Hillard', 'Michael', 'Boatman', 'Stephen', 'Root', 'young', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'one', 'episode.The', 'show', 'out', 'style', 'best', 'episodes', 'series']",Quantum Leap: The Complete Fifth Season
