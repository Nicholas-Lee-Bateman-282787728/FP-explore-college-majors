His entire life is taken up with people of similar background, and he considers anything outside of the Back Bay of Boston to be a foreign country. The film is set in the years prior to WWI and horse drawn forms of transportation are still the norm. He believes in his own form of noblesse oblige, and is very satisfied with his ways of giving back to the community - Tuesday Night Club on Tuesday, Wednesday Night Club on Wednesday - need I say more?In this rarefied museum piece of a life, George's children are about to turn everything upside down. His daughter is in love with a Harvard professor - so far so good - who is a Yale man! And the young man is teaching that Emerson is a rebel! Even worse, his son is in love with a young lady from Worcester whose father is president of a tool and die works! ""A foreigner"" as George himself says. To top things off a flashing electric sign advertising Grapenuts has been put within sight of his front door.Like I said before, if the part of George was played by anybody else but the dapper and charming Colman, this guy would probably come across as insufferable. As it turns out, George really has a generous soul, a point that is driven home by Colman's portrayal, but his point of view is crowded with traditions that are centuries old whose origin he doesn't really understand himself, and to step away from them - or to see any member of his family step away from them - leads to a sense of discomfort that makes him feel that he perceives a wrong that must be righted.I'll let you watch and see how this all works out, but it really is a delightful comedy of manners with real heart and delightful character actors in the supporting roles. Highly recommended.As for quality, the sound and picture are excellent.",4,"A descendant of the Puritans is forced to deal with ""this modern age""",1370736000,"06 9, 2013",2013,1909,"['doubt', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'pulled', 'off', 'Ronald', 'Colman', 'title', 'role', 'descendant', 'prominent', 'Apley', 'family', 'Boston', 'entire', 'life', 'taken', 'up', 'people', 'similar', 'background', 'anything', 'Back', 'Bay', 'Boston', 'be', 'foreign', 'country', 'film', 'set', 'years', 'prior', 'WWI', 'horse', 'drawn', 'forms', 'transportation', 'are', 'still', 'norm', 'own', 'form', 'noblesse', 'oblige', 'very', 'satisfied', 'ways', 'giving', 'back', 'community', 'Tuesday', 'Night', 'Club', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Night', 'Club', 'Wednesday', 'need', 'say', 'more', 'rarefied', 'museum', 'piece', 'life', 'George', 'children', 'are', 'turn', 'everything', 'upside', 'down', 'daughter', 'love', 'Harvard', 'professor', 'so', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'who', 'Yale', 'man', 'young', 'man', 'teaching', 'Emerson', 'rebel', 'Even', 'worse', 'son', 'love', 'young', 'lady', 'Worcester', 'father', 'president', 'tool', 'die', 'foreigner', 'George', 'top', 'things', 'off', 'flashing', 'electric', 'sign', 'advertising', 'Grapenuts', 'been', 'put', 'sight', 'front', 'door.Like', 'said', 'part', 'George', 'was', 'played', 'anybody', 'else', 'dapper', 'charming', 'Colman', 'guy', 'would', 'probably', 'come', 'insufferable', 'out', 'George', 'really', 'generous', 'soul', 'point', 'driven', 'home', 'Colman', 'portrayal', 'point', 'view', 'crowded', 'traditions', 'are', 'centuries', 'old', 'origin', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'step', 'away', 'see', 'member', 'family', 'step', 'away', 'sense', 'discomfort', 'feel', 'wrong', 'must', 'be', 'righted.I', ""'ll"", 'let', 'watch', 'see', 'how', 'out', 'really', 'delightful', 'comedy', 'manners', 'real', 'heart', 'delightful', 'character', 'actors', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Highly', 'recommended.As', 'quality', 'sound', 'picture', 'are', 'excellent']",The Late George Apley

Marquand wrote a number of novels, the best movie adaptation is clearly H.M. Pulham Esquire with Robert Young and Hedy Lamarr (see that for sure).  If you are a Ronald Colman fan as I am you will like this movie as well, but it is carried mostly by his character.  Most of the supporting cast is fair, but clearly of B status to the star.  Like ""Pulham"" the story centers on people trapped in their east coast class structures and both move at a slow pace.  The missing element is the great love story in ""Pulham"" that isn't really there in this tale.  His kids' love affairs are very backseat to the father character.  In some ways, Charles Coburn's character in the ""Pulham"" film is Colman's character here, but thrust into a secondary role.  You will enjoy the movie, but don't go in expecting a classic.",4,"Colman great as usual, movie good",1377129600,"08 22, 2013",2013,922,"['mainly', 'wanted', 'write', 'review', 'temper', 'expectations', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'Marquand', 'wrote', 'number', 'novels', 'best', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'clearly', 'H.M.', 'Pulham', 'Esquire', 'Robert', 'Young', 'Hedy', 'Lamarr', 'see', 'sure', 'are', 'Ronald', 'Colman', 'fan', 'am', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'carried', 'mostly', 'character', 'Most', 'supporting', 'cast', 'fair', 'clearly', 'B', 'status', 'star', 'Pulham', 'story', 'centers', 'people', 'trapped', 'east', 'coast', 'class', 'structures', 'move', 'slow', 'pace', 'missing', 'element', 'great', 'love', 'story', 'Pulham', ""n't"", 'really', 'there', 'tale', 'kids', 'love', 'affairs', 'are', 'very', 'backseat', 'father', 'character', 'ways', 'Charles', 'Coburn', 'character', 'Pulham', 'film', 'Colman', 'character', 'here', 'thrust', 'secondary', 'role', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'classic']",The Late George Apley
1607627,A2TO31D8XDFPZR,B00AB2O0TO,Roger Blunck,"[14, 14]","""The Late George Apley"" is a true comedy classic.  I held my breath when this DVD arrived hoping for a good print.  I wasn't disappointed.  It delivers a top-notch cast (including some of Hollywood's greatest character actors), wonderful script, excellent photography and masterful direction by Joseph L. Mankiewicz (""A Letter to Three Wives"", ""All About Eve"").  If I have any complaints it's that a snippet of film is missing (it's the same in all the prints I've seen).  In the scene where Vanessa Brown is about to play her piano waltz there's an obvious, sharp cut and when it returns Peggy Cummins is suddenly in the scene without actually having entered the room. Did some TV station cut the solo and neglect to put it back in?  Regardless, anyone who buys this DVD is in store for pure entertainment.  ""The Late George Apley"" had it's New York premiere as the Easter attracion at Radio City Music Hall and earned rave reviews.  It hits Boston snobbery but always with humor and warmth.  I often chuckle thinking of it paired on a double bill with ""The Shocking Miss Pilgrim"", a fun Betty Grable musical, with Gershwin lyrics that proclaim in Boston ""even a salad must have dressing"".  Ignore the comments about the print.  This is as good as it's going to get.  Any classic film fan will appreciate this quality production.  Sit back and enjoy it.",5,Ronald Colman  shines in this witty comedy classic!,1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,1354,"['Late', 'George', 'Apley', 'true', 'comedy', 'classic', 'held', 'breath', 'when', 'DVD', 'arrived', 'hoping', 'good', 'print', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'top-notch', 'cast', 'including', 'Hollywood', 'greatest', 'character', 'actors', 'wonderful', 'script', 'excellent', 'photography', 'masterful', 'direction', 'Joseph', 'L.', 'Mankiewicz', 'Letter', 'Three', 'Wives', 'Eve', 'have', 'complaints', 'snippet', 'film', 'missing', 'same', 'prints', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'scene', 'where', 'Vanessa', 'Brown', 'play', 'piano', 'waltz', 'obvious', 'sharp', 'cut', 'when', 'Peggy', 'Cummins', 'suddenly', 'scene', 'actually', 'having', 'entered', 'room', 'Did', 'TV', 'station', 'cut', 'solo', 'neglect', 'put', 'back', 'Regardless', 'anyone', 'who', 'DVD', 'store', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'Late', 'George', 'Apley', 'had', 'New', 'York', 'premiere', 'Easter', 'attracion', 'Radio', 'City', 'Music', 'Hall', 'earned', 'rave', 'reviews', 'Boston', 'snobbery', 'always', 'humor', 'warmth', 'often', 'chuckle', 'thinking', 'paired', 'double', 'bill', 'Shocking', 'Miss', 'Pilgrim', 'fun', 'Betty', 'Grable', 'musical', 'Gershwin', 'lyrics', 'proclaim', 'Boston', 'even', 'salad', 'must', 'have', 'dressing', 'comments', 'print', 'as', 'good', 'going', 'get', 'classic', 'film', 'fan', 'will', 'appreciate', 'quality', 'production', 'Sit', 'back', 'enjoy']",The Late George Apley
