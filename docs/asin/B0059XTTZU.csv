1448206,A9CHQYIX61N1T,B0059XTTZU,Amazon Customer,"[1, 3]","In Weekend, Director Andrew Haigh gracefully yet candidly explores what happens when two people meet for the first time, become sexually intimate within hours, and eventually part ways going opposite destinations.  Set in Nottingham, UK, Russell (Tom Cullen) is a reserved lifeguard that randomly picks up Glen (Chris New), an artist, in a nightclub on a Friday night, leading the audience to believe a one-night stand will be the finale.  But it turns out there is a lot of chemistry and curiosity between the two. Glen learns that Russell struggles with being open about his sexual preference because as Glen tries to publicly display affection, Russell wants to shake hands and keep a safe distance.  Russell has a straight married best friend and is godfather to his pal's children.  Furthermore, Russell depends heavily on drugs and booze to lower his inhibitions and before letting his guard down to have sex.  Russell wants a committed relationship. When Glen asked Russell was he happy, Glen's response was that he was doing just fine.  On the other hand, Glen is adamant about not having a boyfriend but Russell learns from Glen's female roommate that Glen is angry, if not bitter, from a previous relationship.  Russell is matter-of-factly told by Glen that he is leaving the next day headed to America.  Glen explains he is moving to Portland, Oregon, to take an art history course for two years to move ahead in life.  Russell fervently predicts that as Glen gets lonely in Portland, and misses his friends from home, Glen will compromise his gayness for loneliness and blend into the straight life.  Glen states that he admires the gays in America. Glen believes the American gays fight for their equality and freedom and don't seek the approval or permission of those that are straight.  The emotional bond intensifies as both exchange stories about their childhood, as Russell meets Glen's friends, and as Glen reads Russell's laptop journal of sexual encounters. Both characters are fighting inner demons thus searching for peace and resolve.Weekend is both dark and luminous. It transcends beyond a movie about the gay experience of ""coming out"". Weekend is a movie about the human experience to push out of passivity and into strength.  Actors Tom Cullen and Chris New delivered capturing performances and served as a convincing pair.  Although certain transitions from one scene to the next appeared fragmented, Weekend closed the gap as being deeply sensory. WEEKEND won the Audience Award (Emerging Visions) at SXSW Festival 2011 and Jury Prize at Outfest 2011.

1448207,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0059XTTZU,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","`Weekend' is basically running dialog between two gay men on the cusp of a serious relationship.  They meet at a club, they spend the night together and they wake up to a connection they didn't expect and a weekend that will prove to be their last together that builds in each of them the hope of a different tomorrow.I want to first address the idea that this is a `Gay Movie'.  I've been one to always search for a universal tone to films because I feel that most films (at least the important ones) can reach a wider audience if one is willing to open their minds to what they are seeing and find their own sense of poignancy inside the film's themes.  For instance, I have refused to consider `Brokeback Mountain' a `Gay Film' because, to me, it is more a film about forbidden love and really just as poignant and universally understood as `Romeo + Juliet'.  For me though, `Weekend' is undoubtedly a `Gay Movie'.  It really strikes a chord within that particular community and becomes a poster child for gay relationships that, while I can see and should see a transference to the straight world and more or less the idea of relationships as a whole, the film's primary focus is the stigmas and the controversial ideals surrounding gay romance.  I actually think that it is important to understand that this movie is about gay romance because it is that aspect of the film and its construction that make it so moving.It makes you think.Oh, and I just want to say that Tom Cullen's beautifully pure portrayal of Russell is one of the acting highlights of the year; easily.The film opens with Russell getting ready for a night out.  He goes to visit his best friend and his wife and their friends and he seems content, yet a little withdrawn and somewhat unhappy.  He leaves and heads over to a gay club where he spies out a few potential dates and winds up fondling Glen and taking him home.  The next morning Glen practically pushes a tape recorder in Russell's face and asks him what he remembers about their night together.  Despite his apparent uncomfortable feelings, Russell seems intrigued by Glen, to the point where he texts him later and they wind up hooking up.  From that point forward they cultivate the beginnings of love by talking and talking and talking some more; sharing secrets and feelings and concerns and ultimately baring their souls in ways that they aren't used to nor have ever been comfortable with.  It is within those conversations that `Weekend' becomes so important.  Whether they are sharing intimate details about their sexual partners (Russell's reading of a journal entry regarding a married man was particularly emotional and unnerving) or confessing personal feelings with regard to their sexuality (the way that Russell openly admits wishing he were straight at times was particularly brave and certainly says a lot about the soul of this film) or just sifting through dialog in a way to make conversation; Glen and Russell are becoming real people in a real world in a real situation.As `Weekend' draws to a close it begins to wind down in a similar way to its beginning, which is where I wished it would have ended.  With those bookends it would have made a big statement about the slow progression of change, but instead it shook up that moment by adding a predictable twist (that `Notting Hill' moment).  I would have liked the last five minutes to have been bypassed, but I understand why they were there and they really don't take anything away from this tremendous film.Whether you are straight or gay, `Weekend' will touch you because it is honest.  Honesty is something that is often overlooked in cinema, so when it comes along it is important to grab hold of it and truly appreciate all that it is saying to you.  `Weekend' says so much with seemingly so little.",5,Soft and intimate and certainly thought provoking...,1326931200,"01 19, 2012",2012,3816,"['Weekend', 'basically', 'running', 'dialog', 'two', 'gay', 'men', 'cusp', 'serious', 'relationship', 'meet', 'club', 'spend', 'night', 'together', 'wake', 'up', 'connection', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'weekend', 'will', 'prove', 'be', 'last', 'together', 'hope', 'different', 'tomorrow.I', 'want', 'first', 'address', 'idea', 'Gay', 'Movie', ""'ve"", 'been', 'one', 'always', 'search', 'universal', 'tone', 'films', 'feel', 'most', 'films', 'least', 'important', 'ones', 'can', 'reach', 'wider', 'audience', 'one', 'willing', 'open', 'minds', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'find', 'own', 'sense', 'poignancy', 'film', 'themes', 'instance', 'have', 'refused', 'consider', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'Gay', 'Film', 'because', 'more', 'film', 'forbidden', 'love', 'really', 'just', 'poignant', 'universally', 'understood', 'Romeo', '+', 'Juliet', 'Weekend', 'undoubtedly', 'Gay', 'Movie', 'really', 'chord', 'particular', 'community', 'poster', 'child', 'gay', 'relationships', 'can', 'see', 'should', 'see', 'transference', 'straight', 'world', 'more', 'less', 'idea', 'relationships', 'whole', 'film', 'primary', 'focus', 'stigmas', 'controversial', 'ideals', 'surrounding', 'gay', 'romance', 'actually', 'think', 'important', 'understand', 'movie', 'gay', 'romance', 'aspect', 'film', 'construction', 'make', 'moving.It', 'think.Oh', 'just', 'want', 'say', 'Tom', 'Cullen', 'beautifully', 'pure', 'portrayal', 'Russell', 'one', 'acting', 'highlights', 'year', 'film', 'opens', 'Russell', 'getting', 'ready', 'night', 'out', 'visit', 'best', 'friend', 'wife', 'friends', 'content', 'little', 'withdrawn', 'somewhat', 'unhappy', 'heads', 'gay', 'club', 'where', 'out', 'few', 'potential', 'dates', 'up', 'fondling', 'Glen', 'taking', 'home', 'next', 'morning', 'Glen', 'practically', 'tape', 'recorder', 'Russell', 'face', 'what', 'night', 'together', 'apparent', 'uncomfortable', 'feelings', 'Russell', 'intrigued', 'Glen', 'point', 'where', 'later', 'wind', 'up', 'hooking', 'up', 'point', 'forward', 'cultivate', 'beginnings', 'love', 'talking', 'talking', 'talking', 'more', 'sharing', 'secrets', 'feelings', 'concerns', 'ultimately', 'baring', 'souls', 'ways', 'are', ""n't"", 'used', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'comfortable', 'conversations', 'Weekend', 'becomes', 'so', 'important', 'are', 'sharing', 'intimate', 'details', 'sexual', 'partners', 'Russell', 'reading', 'journal', 'entry', 'regarding', 'married', 'man', 'was', 'particularly', 'emotional', 'unnerving', 'confessing', 'personal', 'feelings', 'regard', 'sexuality', 'way', 'Russell', 'openly', 'wishing', 'were', 'straight', 'times', 'was', 'particularly', 'brave', 'certainly', 'lot', 'soul', 'film', 'just', 'sifting', 'dialog', 'way', 'make', 'conversation', 'Glen', 'Russell', 'are', 'becoming', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'world', 'real', 'situation.As', 'Weekend', 'draws', 'close', 'wind', 'down', 'similar', 'way', 'beginning', 'where', 'wished', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'bookends', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'big', 'statement', 'slow', 'progression', 'change', 'instead', 'shook', 'up', 'moment', 'adding', 'predictable', 'twist', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'moment', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'have', 'been', 'bypassed', 'understand', 'why', 'were', 'there', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'tremendous', 'film.Whether', 'are', 'straight', 'gay', 'Weekend', 'will', 'touch', 'honest', 'Honesty', 'something', 'often', 'overlooked', 'cinema', 'so', 'when', 'important', 'grab', 'hold', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'saying', 'Weekend', 'so', 'much', 'seemingly', 'so', 'little']",Weekend
1448208,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B0059XTTZU,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[8, 9]","Russell is a somewhat shy gay young man who is not ""out"" to most friends or family.  He spends a lot of time with his straight friends there in Nottingham UK, except on the nights that he sneaks away to an out-of-the-way gay bar, looking for the physical connection he thinks he needs, although he really is looking for far more..It is one such Friday night that he meets Glen, a joyfully ""out"" extrovert who first rebuffs Russell's attempts to get acquainted, but later goes home with him. What follows is an intense weekend that changes both of their lives, with each finding in the other the qualities and emotional support missing in their own lives.  It's a very positive film about finding the ""yin"" to your ""yang,"" of developing self-respect and a commitment to live your life the best way possible, as well as acknowledging the people that help you along that journey.The film debuted at the SouthBySouthwest Festival in March 2011, and has since received numerous awards and positive feedback at gay and mainstream indie film festivals.  Previous reviews have complained about mumbled dialogue but, although I often have a problem with British accents, I did not experience that with this film. One review raved it was the ""best gay film since 'Brokeback Mountain""; I wouldn't go that far, but it was probably better than most that have followed.  For a low budget indie film, the acting and quality were quite good, although I could have done without the ""artsy"" shooting of characters reflected in windows, mirrors and walls, or of narrow shots between shoulders or heads of other people in the scene.  Overall, I think it handled a valuable subject realistically and tastefully, and give it a full five stars out of five.As of this writing, ""Weekend"" has finished a run at selected theatres and film festivals, and is available on some cable systems pay-per-view or as streaming video.  I heard rumors of a March 2012 DVD date, but that is not confirmed.

1448215,A2Z74B902BZVC1,B0059XTTZU,Daniel Gamboa,"[2, 2]","I started watching ""Weekend"" not expecting much but I decided to watch it because of the great reviews. I thought it would be another gay-themed film with a clich&eacute; plot and not much to offer. However, what a big surprise it turned out to be. It's a film that's still lingering in my mind even though I watched it a couple of days ago. I do have an issue with the sound, specially at the clubs, but, as a whole, the film was well done for what I assume was a low budget production. I read some reviews complaining because they couldn't understand what the characters were saying. Well, I speak English as a second language, and I didn't even learn it in the UK, and I was able to understand pretty much everything. Sure, a few words escaped me, but to say that people were speaking ""a strange local slang"" shows nothing but ignorance. It's a British film, so, of course, they speak British English.First, I really loved how intimate and intense the atmosphere was. I felt I was living their experience on the set as the movie progressed and each character got to know each other. Second, I thought they had meaningful and important conversations, very often about what it's like to be gay and relationships, although the film never came across as preachy or pretentious or educational. Tom Cullen's performance is so honest that, for a second, you think he's being himself and not really playing a part. I felt his angst and his story to be very convincing, and I would even dare and say that the film is worth watching just for his performance and the character he portrays. Some of the bad reviews about this film claim that ""Weekend"" is about a couple of losers, and I wonder if movies should only be about ""winners"" or ""heroes"". ""Weekend"" is about real people, and call me a loser then, but I was able to relate to both characters even though I am a professional with a respectable job. However, I did think that all the getting high was rather distracting and it didn't add anything to the plot, that's why I gave the film 4 and not 5 stars.",4,An intense and intimate weekend,1365552000,"04 10, 2013",2013,2052,"['started', 'watching', 'Weekend', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'decided', 'watch', 'great', 'reviews', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'gay-themed', 'film', 'clich', 'eacute', 'plot', 'not', 'much', 'offer', 'However', 'what', 'big', 'surprise', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'film', 'still', 'lingering', 'mind', 'even', 'watched', 'couple', 'days', 'ago', 'do', 'have', 'issue', 'sound', 'specially', 'clubs', 'whole', 'film', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'what', 'assume', 'was', 'low', 'budget', 'production', 'read', 'reviews', 'complaining', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'characters', 'were', 'saying', 'Well', 'speak', 'English', 'second', 'language', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'learn', 'UK', 'was', 'able', 'understand', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'Sure', 'few', 'words', 'escaped', 'say', 'people', 'were', 'speaking', 'strange', 'local', 'slang', 'nothing', 'ignorance', 'British', 'film', 'so', 'course', 'speak', 'British', 'English.First', 'really', 'loved', 'how', 'intimate', 'intense', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'felt', 'was', 'living', 'experience', 'set', 'movie', 'progressed', 'character', 'got', 'know', 'other', 'Second', 'thought', 'had', 'meaningful', 'important', 'conversations', 'very', 'often', 'what', 'be', 'gay', 'relationships', 'film', 'never', 'came', 'preachy', 'pretentious', 'educational', 'Tom', 'Cullen', 'performance', 'so', 'honest', 'second', 'think', 'being', 'not', 'really', 'playing', 'part', 'felt', 'angst', 'story', 'be', 'very', 'convincing', 'would', 'even', 'dare', 'say', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'performance', 'character', 'bad', 'reviews', 'film', 'claim', 'Weekend', 'couple', 'losers', 'wonder', 'movies', 'should', 'only', 'be', 'winners', 'heroes', 'Weekend', 'real', 'people', 'call', 'loser', 'then', 'was', 'able', 'relate', 'characters', 'even', 'am', 'professional', 'respectable', 'job', 'However', 'did', 'think', 'getting', 'high', 'was', 'rather', 'distracting', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'plot', 'why', 'gave', 'film', '4', 'not', '5', 'stars']",Weekend
1448216,A3D2DJEHR4U7HC,B0059XTTZU,"D. Hinson ""D. Hinson""","[10, 11]","My partner and I saw this movie in NYC at the IFC Theatre a few months ago, and it really moved us. We're not young, not into drug culture, and weren't seeing it hoping for a glimpse of some eye candy. We had read a review in The New York Times, checked it on Rotten Tomatoes and seen what a high rating both critics AND audiences alike had given it, and that was the draw for us. What a raw and beautiful film...!!The two lead characters in the movie have very little in common, at least in my estimation, except for the fact that they're both gay, young, attractive, and affected by the slings and arrows of surviving in a predominantly straight world. They're very opposite, and therein lies the attraction. Yes, they use recreational drugs like a lot of gay youth. I think the movie does a good job of exploring the demons that cause them to have the kind of low self-worth that drives many gay people to abuse substances. Yet, there is a beauty in the love that develops very quickly between them--despite their self-destructive tendencies. Much bubbles to the surface in their drug fueled time together that might otherwise lie dormant if substances weren't being used, and the crashing down of walls that is the result.Seldom have I seen a film of such gritty honesty. It is uncomfortable seeing the story unfold.

Weekend is such a nuanced, well-acted film that captures what I find to be the least condescending, familiar depiction of the modern gay experience. The subtleties of the strong performances are what made me most feel like I was looking into some kind of mirror. There is a scene where Russell is on the public transit amidst a throng of teenagers where he depicts through body language and mannerisms what I recognize as a distinctly gay form of self-consciousness that many gay people have learned growing up trying our best to modify our behavior. The dalliance itself is very real in it's awkwardness, in the romance of living in a culture where very few promises are made and where experiences slip into memory.

stranger things have happened.so often people are afraid to speak openly or to reveal anything that is absolutely true about them self. what kind of reaction would you have if a trick all of a sudden started interrogating you the morning after? the concept is interesting and terrifying at the same time. ask yourself how often you are willing to open up to a stranger asking what and why they hooked up in the first place. it is very scary to be approached by someone who can totally disarm you. its almost an attack on your senses, you are scared to answer openly and honestly, but perhaps you should because said person is asking.this movie is a fantasy. two men fall in love over a weekend. they unabashedly explore and delve into each other, in more ways than one. the sex scenes are nice, nothing smutty, feel real and unforced. i still call this film a fantasy because so many gay men would not let a weekend like this happen. we all have too much baggage and fear to open up like the men in this movie. but its inspiring its a challenge we should all take. to let people in to let them see our true self. to be fearless and honest. to let yourself be loved and to allow yourself to be transparent. it challenges gay men to be open to their feelings, to be allowed to feel true feelings. honesty is such a hardship in our community, take the challenge to be honest with yourself and with others. at the end of the movie both men are changed and heart broken. the romantic thing about and the refreshing aspect of the movie is how in love they are by the end of the movie. i love the heart ache in their faces, the passion of the kiss they share at then end. the movie is a challenge to gay men, watch the movie and take the challenge. opening up with yourself and others may be the best thing you ever do for yourself.thanks",5,lust to love at first sight,1390953600,"01 29, 2014",2014,2601,"['anyone', 'starving', 'good', 'gay', 'film', 'i', 'implore', 'give', 'one', 'chance', 'i', 'watched', 'movie', 'again', 'prime', 'even', 'i', 'do', 'own', 'so', 'many', 'gay', 'men', 'can', 'relate', 'endless', 'drunk', 'gay', 'pick', 'ups', 'bars', 'always', 'potential', 'finding', 'something', 'worthwhile', 'more', 'typically', 'tired', 'one', 'night', 'character', 'up', 'more', 'when', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'little', 'more', 'other', 'really', 'open', 'up', 'whole', 'movie', 'one', 'weekend', 'lives', 'are', 'changed', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'often', 'closed', 'off', 'find', 'difficult', 'open', 'up', 'things', 'men', 'go', 'separate', 'journeys', 'reach', 'end', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'something', 'end', 'can', 'people', 'really', 'fall', 'love', 'one', 'weekend', 'stranger', 'things', 'have', 'happened.so', 'often', 'people', 'are', 'afraid', 'speak', 'openly', 'reveal', 'anything', 'absolutely', 'true', 'what', 'kind', 'reaction', 'would', 'have', 'trick', 'sudden', 'started', 'interrogating', 'morning', 'concept', 'interesting', 'terrifying', 'same', 'time', 'ask', 'how', 'often', 'are', 'willing', 'open', 'up', 'stranger', 'asking', 'what', 'why', 'hooked', 'up', 'first', 'place', 'very', 'scary', 'be', 'approached', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'totally', 'disarm', 'almost', 'attack', 'senses', 'are', 'scared', 'answer', 'openly', 'honestly', 'perhaps', 'should', 'because', 'said', 'person', 'asking.this', 'movie', 'fantasy', 'two', 'men', 'fall', 'love', 'weekend', 'unabashedly', 'explore', 'delve', 'other', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'nice', 'nothing', 'smutty', 'feel', 'real', 'unforced', 'i', 'still', 'call', 'film', 'fantasy', 'so', 'many', 'gay', 'men', 'would', 'not', 'let', 'weekend', 'happen', 'have', 'too', 'much', 'baggage', 'fear', 'open', 'up', 'men', 'movie', 'inspiring', 'challenge', 'should', 'take', 'let', 'people', 'let', 'see', 'true', 'self', 'be', 'fearless', 'honest', 'let', 'be', 'loved', 'allow', 'be', 'transparent', 'gay', 'men', 'be', 'open', 'feelings', 'be', 'allowed', 'feel', 'true', 'feelings', 'honesty', 'such', 'hardship', 'community', 'take', 'challenge', 'be', 'honest', 'others', 'end', 'movie', 'men', 'are', 'changed', 'heart', 'broken', 'romantic', 'thing', 'refreshing', 'aspect', 'movie', 'how', 'love', 'are', 'end', 'movie', 'i', 'love', 'heart', 'ache', 'passion', 'kiss', 'share', 'then', 'end', 'movie', 'challenge', 'gay', 'men', 'watch', 'movie', 'take', 'challenge', 'opening', 'up', 'others', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'thing', 'ever', 'do', 'yourself.thanks']",Weekend

Rare is the guy who sleeps over, so maybe it happens here because of instead of meeting online both the characters of Ruseell and Glenn meet at a bar and are too drunk to have one leave at 3am.Th kickoff of it being not just another hookup is a scene where Russell asks Glenn to speak about their own hookup in perfect detail into a tape recorder for an art project which is described as a look into the chasm between who we think we are and who we project to the rest of the world.  Glenn's answers to the aggressive questions eventually touch Russell and when he's asked to meet up again, he chooses to give him a chance, all the while knowing he's under the gun to leave for a trip the next day to America for 2 years.Some of these plot points seem unrealistic to an actual hookup but for what we get when the two start to connect, you just go along with it. To the film's credit, it doesnt get cliche about where there is all headed, and the two men have very good chemistry despite it being combustible at times. If there has to be a gay film in the highbrow Criterion Collection, I guess this fits the bill, but it's not as romantic as advertised, especially since there's a ton of drug use in this.

He smokes a little grass before he leaves. He arrives at Jamie's (Jonathan Race) house for a dinner party among friends. They haven't seen him in a while. One of his friends once to see him this Sunday and when Russell is about to confide into him, a bothersome chap, who has been drinking, sits between them. Russell has not told anyone he is gay and does not act like that outside.Russell decides to leave the dinner party and goes into town to the gay bar. In the bathroom, he gets lucky and meets Glen (Chris New) at the urinal.The next morning, in Russell's bedroom, Glen admits he was just flirting with him. Glen mentions to Russell that his breath is minty while his breath is bad, but says it in a direct way. Now Glen wants Russell to do something. It is strange. He wants Russell to speak into the voice recorder about how they met last night and the juicy details about what happened last night. Glen is too serious about this and Russell really doesn't know what to say. This is only a one-nighter. Glen is being pushy, contradictive and really wants Russell to describe the entire night including his feelings. Glen then goes outside on the balcony and starts yelling at a stranger. Russell really does not like this and asks Glen to stop. Before Glen leaves, they exchange text phone numbers.At 10:00am, Russell goes to his job as a lifeguard at the public inside pool.

The problem is the drugs. Russ and Glen (and all their friends) use drugs CONSTANTLY, and it seriously undermines the movie's credibility and effectiveness.It's impossible for me to believe that illegal drug use is so widespread and so rampant in the English working class these people seem to belong to, in a rather provincial city like Nottingham. If it is, then England is a whole lot more different from America than I thought it was. But even if Weekend is accurate in that respect, it undermines the otherwise wonderful story this movie tells, and tells more beautifully and more realistically than any other movie I know of.To me, it's a shame, because the always-in-your-face drug use leaches focus off the two guys onto a side issue that is not really as important in their relationship as its percentage of screen time would indicate. I don't care about drugs one way or another, but I do care about movies, and the heavy drug use in this movie undermines its power by distracting the viewer's attention away from the characters.

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[4, 4]","I always appreciate when a big label like Criterion courts smaller noteworthy offerings that might not ordinarily receive a big distribution.  The prestige label is currently preparing this film for its North American DVD debut.  Taking on Andrew Haigh's ""Weekend"" is certainly one of their more interesting offerings. Some might consider it a niche choice with its homosexual themes and same sex coupling, but ""Weekend"" has a lot to say about how people (of any gender or orientation) connect or don't connect in the modern world. It is a small film, to be sure, that is graced with both a minimalism and a naturalism that might remind you of Mike Leigh's most organic projects. The narrative takes place over the course of one weekend largely within the confines of an apartment. It is a piece that is bolstered by a thoughtful screenplay and two great performances. If you're looking for a big story, this micro-budgeted indie is NOT the picture for you. But if you enjoy realistic dialogue about the human condition, about life, about love and relationships--there is plenty to be admired here.Basically, ""Weekend"" is structured as a brief encounter, a fleeting moment. A relationship in microcosm is played out over a couple of days. The film is completely understated and its quiet effectiveness might sneak up on you. It's a typical enough story, I suppose. Russell (Tom Cullen) heads out to a club looking for some action and as the evening comes to a close, he ends up going home with Glen (Chris New). Neither is under the illusion that this is anything other than a hook-up. In fact, it doesn't appear that the two men share much common ground. What follows is an encounter fueled by drinking, drugs, and sex. But unexpectedly, they also let down their guards and really start to connect. In many ways, ""Weekend"" is about that moment where two people fall in love. It's not a big or dramatic moment, but a subtle shift of how you view someone else--how you seem to fit. While the film does touch on some issues specific to the homosexual community, its underlying themes are much more universal than you might imagine.The film played very well on the festival circuit, even picking up two British Independent Film Awards, one for Best Achievement In Production and one for Most Promising Newcomer Tom Cullen. Cullen is quite exceptional. His Russell is more aloof, more introspective, but as he starts to share more of himself--the openness and vulnerability are etched across his face. Chris New is believable and outspoken, cynical and frank, but with a need to connect maybe he doesn't even fully understand. If the thought of two men having sex or sharing intimacy bothers you, this might not be your first choice. But both actors really make this work, giving of themselves both physically and emotionally. In the end, it's bittersweet, real, natural, and unassuming. What it achieves, it does so quietly, unexpectedly and with surprising subtlety. Perhaps this tiny little movie is not for everyone, but for those that appreciate realistic adult drama--this is a weekend trip worth taking. About 4 1/2 stars.

1448244,AMAWA346T2D3L,B0059XTTZU,"Le Stryge ""in OZ""","[12, 42]","I went to this movie having read all the blurb. A simple story of two gay guys ""looking for lurve"" in all the wrong places over the course of two days.Much was made by the director of the fact he'd cast a ""straight"" actor in the part of one of the gay blokes. Big deal! As if gay actors haven't been playing straights in Hollywood for decades!So what do you get?For a start it's damn bleak. It's set in London, ...but this is no Woody Allen sunshine-tinted evocation such as we saw in ""Midnight in Paris"". It's London at its most grottiest, where the denizens only emerge blinking into the daylight when one bar closes and the drug deal is done or sex partner for the next hour or so has been found.And then it's home to the depressing council housing for some not so furtive couplings, to the sounds of the argument happening next door.I was surprised the two protagonists could even accomplish such acts after the incredible load of drugs they consumed at all stages throughout what purports to be only two days....they simply never stop smoking dope or ingesting some illicit substance for the entire time they spend together. Even a visit to one of their family dinners sees yet more drug taking.The two leads are played by fashionably bearded young blokes, ......the only one evoking any sympathetic reaction at all being the ""sensitive"" pool life-guard.(Yes, he's the ""straight"" actor!) The other bloke is so vapid and drug-induced ""edgy"" that it's impossible to believe anyone would even choose him as momentary bed-material let alone fall in love with him.He's got ""driftwood"" tattooed on his damn forehead!The film itself has shot-on-the-cheap written all over it as well, ...which would not be such an indictment if it actually had something to say.This fatal flaw is not helped by the heavy accents of all the actors, who constantly mumble, so often facing completely away from camera so lip reading is not even an option. No one can massacre the English language quite so effectively as the English themselves.The sound quality itself is absolutely appalling, ....it being SO poorly recorded that whole sections of dialogue, which I'm sure were central to the minimalist plot, were totally indecipherable to me, ...or any other of the audience members I quizzed.The sex, ....ah yes, the ""sex"". I knew we'd have to come round to that!Well if you were upset by the chaste and very brief male/male kiss in Downton Abbey Series One, then yes, you will be driven into outraged religious fervour here at the shameful homosexual couplings of two men. But if you are of more sensible tone, then you will see little that you don't see in hetero movies, with only the gender of the participants being any different.

Featuring two incredible newcomers in the lead roles, ""Weekend"" is quite the wonder. The film shares the aesthetic qualities of a Vampire Weekend album, and one can't help but ponder whether or not the film's director was a bit inspired by the quartet's music. This whole film feels stylistically to represent the feeling of our current time: the fashion, the freshness, the music, and the agenda. This film may seem small, but it's got big ideas.Set during a three-day period in which Russell and Glen question turning a passionate sexual encounter into a relationship before one of them leaves England for America, the film examines the duo question and challenge each other as they become familiar. These characters feel so real, and the film avoids the normal troupes that films these days jump to to try to understand LGBT relationships. This film is truthful sexually, emotionally, and stylistically. A great start for what will hopefully be an illustrious career for director Haigh.The DVD is wonderful.

1448250,A3OHHFOE0J8HEO,B0059XTTZU,M.,"[1, 4]","I believe this is what the film 9 Songs wanted to be. At the end of that movie, I didn't feel anything when the girl left the guy when in Weekend, yes, there was something there when the two guys split up. And it's not because of sexual orientation that one is better connected to the other. Honestly, all I remembered from 9 Songs was that the guy had hardcore sex with the girl. The discussion then would be did the hardcore sex get in the way of the story? Perhaps but that's for another review.I am not a big fan of gay movies for the most part as I find them either too over the top or too gutless. Weekend would be the exception to a large degree. I feel there are holes in the film which I'll explain later in the review but overall the film works.Is it possible to meet someone over the course of time of 48 hours and have that person change your life? Sure why not!? Is it possible to fall in love with someone over that same amount of time? Crazier things can happen in life so again, why not?! But for those like me who are a bit skeptical, we pretty much understand the chances of all that happening are quite slim in today's world. The romanticism that's depicted in the movie is pretty much old-fashion and dare I say dead!? But isn't that what we all secretly yearn for anyways? We find that person that comes into our lives even if it's for a slight moment and we open ourselves up and take a chance even if we get hurt in the end. That's the risk that comes with finding love.I feel the character Tom Cullen plays is better equipped to find his hook-ups at a place that's more like a sex club instead of a gay bar based on his psychology. But that's just my opinion!I personally didn't find the sex in the movie graphic to be honest and not that I wanted it to be more hardcore but there was something missing there. Like it was too tame perhaps. The story would've been brilliant if the sex scenes were a bit more interesting and then you would've had the intimate moments between the two guys where they discuss their fears and such which was actually played convincingly by the two actors.There was a scene where I felt Chris New needed to work a bit more on his improvisational skills. The scene that I'm referring to is when his character asks Russell on the second day they meet perhaps they can go out that night. I believe he wanted to show how uncomfortable his character felt about doing that and so as a defense mechanism he puts on the hoodie he was wearing. For some reason I wasn't all that convinced and felt the scene came off a bit too contrived.But both male lead actors did a good job. I think Tom Cullen has the right idea about where he'd like to go with his career based on the interviews he's given.Adding the music of John Grant was an exceptional plus! If the song at the end doesn't have you in tears or at least in a pensive mood then I don't know if you have blood in your veins.I'm not sure if this movie would truly transcend to the straight community. I mean I guess those with an open heart can appreciate it but in the end it's an intimate story about two gay men and I believe that'll be an obstacle to some degree for those who may want to find a complete connection.The way the movie ended is actually quite powerful and I'm glad it was done in a more open-ended manner. You can't help but wonder what will happen to those guys? How will they both utilize in future days what they've learned about themselves in the last 48 hours? But most importantly, will their paths cross again?

It's a movie with few frills and just focuses on the story and that helped keeps it rather refreshing compared to a lot of the flashier movies out there.

But the irony of handing it that title is that Weekend itself is a terrific analyzation of the boundaries often placed between the gay community and the straight community. In this film we follow two gay men who have just met: Russell (Tom Cullen): A life Guard who is still a tad insecure about his sexuality, and Glen (Chris New) an outed artist who plans to go to America to flee the boundaries that hold him back in England. The film follows the two over the course of one weekend, the majority spent in Russell's small apartment, where the two men learn about each other, have sex, and have fascinating conversations pertaining to the stigmas placed on homosexuals in a ""Straight"" world. It is somewhat clich&eacute; now to describe a film as having a ""documentary feel"", but what other way is there to describe Weekend? Here is a film that is so intimate, so realistically acted and full of moments so private that it is impossible to look away. The performances are magnetic and unforgettable while the script is one of immense intelligence.At its core the film deals with homosexual issues yes, but does that mean it is only for gays and lesbians? Only if you're one of those people who also think Spike Lee films and Roots are only for black people. If anything this is a film that should be viewed more so by straight people. It is a superb document on the humanization of homosexuals. It shows us that we all are pining for the same existential things: Acceptance and love. Those two things might be wrapped in different looking packages between different people, but beneath the exterior the same kind of love is there. For that insightful revelation alone I would recommend Andrew Haigh's Weekend, but there is so much more to it. It is an exceptional film that follows in the footsteps of such great films as Before Sunrise. and like that film it haunts you for days afterward.

It does not feel scripted or remotely theatrical; we are mere observers of 48 hours between two strangers. The dialogue, content, and raw emotion are more real than anything I've seen in other films.The basic premise is that two young men meet and hook up at a gay bar. They awake the next morning, clearly having had sex, and yet they struggle to build up a conversation. The sex part was easy; the romance is more difficult. As the day progresses, one man texts the other and they meet up again. They develop the kind of infectious relationship of meeting someone once but instantly having a connection, and wanting to revisit that habitually.Their lives and insecurities are explored more thoroughly as the film progresses, through heart-sinking drama that we don't get in most romantic dramas (if you can even call this a romance). Much of their bickering is how they deal with being gay in a largely heternormative world, but their struggles and frustrations with one another are universal to anyone who's been in a relationship, and ultimately, the heavy silence when a discussion's hit a dead end.Weekend, one of the best films of 2011, is so special because it is all the more relatable through its specificity. Without defining clear characters, the intimacy and believability of this relationship would not ring true with audiences. I saw it twice in two days and am eager to revisit again soon. The climactic ending, while not exactly happy or sad, makes you want to go back to the beginning and go through this experience again.

1448279,A39UKBJJXJ82FO,B0059XTTZU,Tristan,"[15, 17]","I avoided this film like the plague for the longest time before watching it out of boredom one night. I was honestly surprised by how much it resonated with me. It lacked just about cliche element that I thought it contained prior to watching. I dislike most gay themed films. To me, they are just simply not honest and upfront enough about what they're about. Few films, to me, have really shown how it is to be gay. So often do filmmakers fail to pull it off that it actually sort of makes me sick when I even bother to try and take a chance on a new gay film. It doesn't even matter, most of the time, if the film ends up being any good upon conclusion, as I often feel totally off put by some sort of aspect of it. I honestly don't think that most filmmakers can truly pull off making an effective and resonant film about the gay experience. Some of the best ones I've seen are coming of age pictures (SHOW ME LOVE, YOU ARE NOT ALONE, etc). Aside from those, the occasional genre film, some indie slices of life here and there (SHELTER, MYSTERIOUS SKIN, MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO), and some good foreign films occasionally do the trick. I'm not going to lie, it is disheartening to me. Why can't people pull it off? What is it about homosexuality that freaks people out so damn much? To me, it all has to do with societal fears. Most filmmakers are afraid to explore what a gay relationship truly is like. Most folks feel a lot more comfortable placing gender barriers around their gay characters and would rather pretend that two gay men or two gay women sleeping together are no different than a man and a woman sleeping together. In truth, and I'm sure I'm gonna get some flack for this, a gay relationship is completely different from a straight relationship. Everything, from body language to physical contact is approached in completely different ways than in straight relationships, and pretending that one person in a two person relationship is the man or the woman in opposition to their partner simply doesn't change the fact that they are still two people with the exact same anatomy as one another. Now, one could go on about bisexuality or what it means to be in a relationship with a transsexual, and that's all well and good. I could talk about the worlds of bisexual men and women until the sun rises (and in fact I have), but when it comes to someone like me who is looking for a gay themed film to speak to me, I'm one to take lots of chances. Like I've said, I've seen a lot of horrendous films. Most of the films I've seen are, one could say, gay versions of films that already exist! BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is GONE WITH THE WIND. Oh my gosh, EDGE OF SEVENTEEN is like a gay John Hughes films! What's all this I'm hearing about a friggin' gay version of ROMEO & JULIET? The point I'm trying to make is that people always have to try and put gay relationships into these straight, &#34;idealized&#34; positions, and while there's really nothing wrong with that I think that it takes a lot of way from the organic ingenuity and the beauty of what it means to be gay and to be in love with someone of the same gender. There truly is a lot of beauty in that concept, but because of the way society and the media have progressed, we cannot help but feel that gay people are more effective as punchlines or as an undesirable end, which I find infuriating. Nothing irritates me more when I see a film in which a character shrugs off a gay relationship with any kind of fear or disgust. I don't care if someone doesn't want to see it. Gay people have had plenty of it shoved down their throats for, literally, decades, and I personally find it equally offensive when gay folks flaunt their sexuality out in the open. The way I see it, sexuality, nudity, and sex itself is a beautiful and incredible thing, no matter who does it and how. One of the things that this film WEEKEND realizes right off is that there is a lot of beauty in the idea of being a gay man lying naked in bed drinking a cup of tea and having another man's bare ass resting in between your crotch.So I have noticed that many people have called this the BEFORE SUNRISE of gay films. Well, they're both about the triumph of young love, they're both about people who have a limited amount of time to spend with one another, and they're both about intelligent people having long conversations about things, but otherwise I feel they are nothing alike. I love both films to death, but really this is a completely different kind of world than the world of C&eacute;line and Jesse. No, these two guys have nothing in common with them and little in common even with one another. I'd go so far as to say that the film ONCE is a slightly more truthful comparison, but even that is a stretch to me (mainly due to the fact that, well, this isn't a musical). Here we have a film in which this older twenty something named Russell (Tom Cullen) decides to ditch some sort of friendly function in order to maybe engage in some anonymous sex. He has an encounter with a younger, sassier, friendly little guy named Glen (Chris New) who immediately, within minutes of waking up the next morning, shoves a recorder in her face asking him to share intimate details of the fun they had last night. It is after this brief exchange that they begin to rock one another's worlds, in the verbal sense anyway, though occasionally drifting away into dirty, yet loving, sex with one another. As the film continues on they challenge one another, occasionally driving each other crazy, but never are they fully able to admit, at least not right away, that they are undeniably smitten with one another. One of them (Russell) doesn't like to &#34;date&#34;. The other (Glen) is still feeling a lot of heartache from a previous failed relationship. Glen, unfortunately for them (and for us), has to leave Europe to go to America for a school project, so they only have the entire weekend to spend together. By the end of that weekend, the two will have grown into different people whose previous fears and instincts will have evolved and they will forever be haunted by one another. These two men are basically going to change each other's lives.To be honest, this film WEEKEND couldn't have come at a better time for me in my life. I'm going through the process of going through a break-up after a great four year run, and it is really hard for me to do. I totally got where the Glen character was coming from in describing his feelings about the relationship he had. This film gave me a lot of hope for myself to find someone. I've never been the best at maintaining relationships prior to this 4 year relationship that just ended, and that's why I'm pretty scared to even start thinking about something like that again considering how painful it is for me, right now, to just move on. I never thought that I was the kind of guy who could get so attached to someone like that, and that's why it hurts so much for me to force myself to move on after seeing myself in a totally different place than that. I can't help but feel that I am no longer loved, even though I know that isn't the case. Many of the scenes in this film captured the feelings and the fear of loneliness without being alone. The film also captured the feel of a relationship with another man, right down to the smell of the sex, and one of the things that struck me the most about this film was how adult these people were about their circumstances. This isn't the kind of film that is going to take the time to hold the viewer by the hand and thrust them into the very adult world of love and lust and attraction and sexual behavior. This film, unapologetically, thrusts you in, but does it in a way that never feels exploitative or even gratuitous. In fact, there's relatively little nudity in the film at all. The picture, when it comes to sex, never boils down to details, instead opting to take the MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO route and use simple gestures and feelings associated with sex to develop the relationship.I keep mentioning the sex because, quite honestly, the sex is one of the most important parts of almost all relationships. Here, the sex between these two functions as a kind of bridge between these guys to try and at least absorb the sensitivity of their passionate emotions. It happens to be most felt during the dialogue scenes, but that doesn't mean that their relationship is primarily physical. In fact, it is anything but. What these men provide in one another is a sense of leveling as well as a sense of emotional security in one another for them to be able to count on. These two men don't fail one another, and while their discussions may get heated, particularly during a particularly drug fueled night, they can never quite bring themselves to allow the other to escape their grasps, even when they feel that they've finally found a reason or two to do so. Because of this, their relationship feels genuinely romantic, as does the film, and the film chooses to use simple, doe-eyed touches to show this rather than resorting to cliches or story constraints to try and develop stakes that don't even need to exist. WEEKEND is a very loving, sweet, cute film, and the best part about it is that it is organically so. It doesn't resort to montages or goofy plot twists and misunderstandings to try and strengthen something that is already so beautiful and so powerful.If you are looking for a film that is honest about love without being trite or ill-conforming, or if you are simply just looking for a good old fashioned love story and you are open-minded enough to enjoy a love story that you may or may not be able to fully grasp, at least on a physical level, I simply cannot think of that many better recent examples than WEEKEND. Watch it with your girlfriend or your boyfriend. Watch it by yourself if you want to. To me, it doesn't matter if you're gay or straight. This film, despite exploring gay culture on at least a somewhat substantial level, deals with some very universal emotions. Everyone, whether they are gay or straight, has felt like these two men at one time in their lives or another. Everyone experiences a lot of discomforting revelations, truths, and questions about themselves, and the men in this film deal with those same things. The only difference is that they love each other so much that they aren't afraid to share those experiences, questions, and thoughts with one another because they both understand that they are part of a minority that is going to be treated as lesser for a long time still. WEEKEND is a progressive love story that explores the depths of human emotion without forgetting that the love story is, and always will be, one of the most satisfying kinds of stories for always until the end of time.",5,A beautiful meditation on how great it feels to fall in love,1353888000,"11 26, 2012",2012,10790,"['avoided', 'film', 'plague', 'longest', 'time', 'watching', 'boredom',
