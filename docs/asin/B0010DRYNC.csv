The message is repeated over and over, replete with gross-out closeups of the rotting teeth and pitted skin developed by the hard core meth addict. I'm not sure what the point of this film was, other than to be yet another anti-drug screed. I found it tiresome and ejected before the finish.",2,Preachy and repetitive,1244678400,"06 11, 2009",2009,410,"['cast', 'meth', 'addicts', 'law', 'enforcement', 'types', 'community', 'treatment', 'activists', 'preach', 'toll', 'taken', 'meth', 'message', 'repeated', 'replete', 'gross-out', 'closeups', 'rotting', 'teeth', 'pitted', 'skin', 'developed', 'hard', 'core', 'meth', 'addict', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'point', 'film', 'was', 'other', 'be', 'yet', 'anti-drug', 'screed', 'found', 'tiresome', 'ejected', 'finish']",American Meth

1125346,A2P2JXU9JEYNV3,B0010DRYNC,"Marian M. Matsunaga ""karma""","[6, 9]","""American Meth"" Might just open some eyes that were totally oblivious to the problem this country has, regarding this VERY dangerous ""drug"", and it's effects, not just to the user, but on society, as well. There are interviews of ""former"" Meth users, in states that one would not associate with this sort of thing. From Montana and Wyoming, to Utah. The cities these people live in, are more aptly referred to as ""Towns""! Not the first place one would look, to see the epidemic.We are introduced to some ""former"" users, and their viewpoint on their progress to kick the drug. A question is asked of them, about the current Anti-Meth Campaigns being put forth by the respective states, if they are effective. The answer is NO.Then we see interviews of Law Enforcement Officials, Social Workers and City Leaders, with their views on how to eradicate Meth from Society. There is one Deputy, in Multnomah County, Oregon, who has erected a site online, that one can see the physical effects of Meth. This drug has everything one could look for, if they want to look 40 years older than they actually are!! It's a sobering view of the damage this drug causes. The Website is: facesofmeth.usThen we are privy, somewhat, to the private lives of James and Holly, Husband and Wife Meth users, with four youngsters, living on the fringes, because of their habit, and the bad decisions made, because of it. As another reviewer states, this segment begins to look like a ""Reality Show"", because the segment is so heavily edited. We do, however, get to see Holly going door to door, bumming money, to buy the drug, then the immediate effects of the drug, in front of her family! These two WANT to get off Meth, but do not possess the personal fortitude to do so, so they make the decision to move back to Illinois, where they came from.There is a ray of hope, at the conclusion of the film, as we are given updates on all the people that were interviewed. They so far, have remained clean. James and Holly, likewise, reached Illinois, and among family and friends, have been clean, and are resuming the lives that Meth put on hold, for so long.The film challenges Leaders, of Town, City and State, to find ways of educating the young, on the destructive nature of this drug, which is 40 times stronger than Heroin, and has a microscopic recovery rate, when compared to Heroin recovery, BEFORE they take the drug, as was seen in those interviews. ONE HIT is enough to keep one addicted! It also challenges parents, to be involved in their children's lives, and provide a foil, against drug use.A very informative documentary on the epidemic of the modern age.",4,This is another ingredient I like!,1209600000,"05 1, 2008",2008,2644,"['American', 'Meth', 'Might', 'just', 'open', 'eyes', 'were', 'totally', 'oblivious', 'problem', 'country', 'regarding', 'VERY', 'dangerous', 'drug', 'effects', 'not', 'just', 'user', 'society', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'interviews', 'former', 'Meth', 'users', 'states', 'one', 'would', 'not', 'associate', 'sort', 'thing', 'Montana', 'Wyoming', 'Utah', 'cities', 'people', 'live', 'are', 'more', 'aptly', 'referred', 'Towns', 'Not', 'first', 'place', 'one', 'would', 'look', 'see', 'epidemic.We', 'are', 'introduced', 'former', 'users', 'viewpoint', 'progress', 'kick', 'drug', 'question', 'asked', 'current', 'Anti-Meth', 'Campaigns', 'being', 'put', 'forth', 'respective', 'states', 'are', 'effective', 'answer', 'NO.Then', 'see', 'interviews', 'Law', 'Enforcement', 'Officials', 'Social', 'Workers', 'City', 'Leaders', 'views', 'how', 'eradicate', 'Meth', 'Society', 'one', 'Deputy', 'Multnomah', 'County', 'Oregon', 'who', 'erected', 'site', 'online', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'physical', 'effects', 'Meth', 'drug', 'everything', 'one', 'could', 'look', 'want', 'look', '40', 'years', 'older', 'actually', 'are', 'sobering', 'view', 'damage', 'drug', 'Website', 'facesofmeth.usThen', 'are', 'privy', 'somewhat', 'private', 'lives', 'James', 'Holly', 'Husband', 'Wife', 'Meth', 'users', 'four', 'youngsters', 'living', 'fringes', 'habit', 'bad', 'decisions', 'made', 'reviewer', 'segment', 'look', 'Reality', 'Show', 'segment', 'so', 'heavily', 'edited', 'do', 'however', 'get', 'see', 'Holly', 'going', 'door', 'door', 'bumming', 'money', 'buy', 'drug', 'then', 'immediate', 'effects', 'drug', 'front', 'family', 'two', 'WANT', 'get', 'off', 'Meth', 'do', 'not', 'possess', 'personal', 'fortitude', 'do', 'so', 'make', 'decision', 'move', 'back', 'Illinois', 'where', 'came', 'from.There', 'ray', 'hope', 'conclusion', 'film', 'are', 'given', 'updates', 'people', 'were', 'interviewed', 'so', 'far', 'have', 'remained', 'clean', 'James', 'Holly', 'likewise', 'reached', 'Illinois', 'family', 'friends', 'have', 'been', 'clean', 'are', 'resuming', 'lives', 'Meth', 'put', 'hold', 'so', 'long.The', 'film', 'challenges', 'Leaders', 'Town', 'City', 'State', 'find', 'ways', 'educating', 'young', 'destructive', 'nature', 'drug', '40', 'times', 'stronger', 'Heroin', 'microscopic', 'recovery', 'rate', 'when', 'compared', 'Heroin', 'recovery', 'take', 'drug', 'was', 'seen', 'interviews', 'ONE', 'HIT', 'enough', 'keep', 'one', 'addicted', 'also', 'parents', 'be', 'involved', 'children', 'lives', 'provide', 'foil', 'drug', 'use.A', 'very', 'informative', 'documentary', 'epidemic', 'modern', 'age']",American Meth
1125347,A2HMB1IEBSGSHJ,B0010DRYNC,sneaky-sneaky,"[17, 21]","A first-time film-maker gets the benefit of the doubt for what is ultimately a very well intentioned and necessary documentary narrated by Val Kilmer.  ""American Meth"" moves along smoothly in the beginning and takes in a fair cross-section of America, interviewing both addicts, law enforcement, and others who clean up or otherwise try to alleviate the mess.  Justin Hunt's documentary explains the history of its subject drug, names those who invented and refined it, and provides snippets like the fact that Hitler was a regular user.  There is also an outstanding rundown of meth ingredients that many people will have never heard of, including lithium batteries and lightbulbs!  Unfortunately the narrative hits a wall in the form of James and Holly, two excuse-making addicts, and the show devolves into reality tv that strongly resembles ""Big Brother"" shot in a double-wide.  Unfortunately there are four children involved, with all of the males sporting outrageous mullets, and much yelling and waving of arms is awkwardly subtitled as a way of explaining each argument and counteraccusation.  This was the STOP button for me.  Threaded throughout the documentary and available separately is an excellent soundtrack, a redeeming feature that you can take with you.  Documentarian Justin Hunt will learn from his first venture, and will be back in the future with greater things.",3,"Ingredients: Drano, Ammonia, Batteries: Do Not Try This Drug",1207180800,"04 3, 2008",2008,1386,"['first-time', 'film-maker', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'what', 'ultimately', 'very', 'well', 'intentioned', 'necessary', 'documentary', 'narrated', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'American', 'Meth', 'along', 'smoothly', 'beginning', 'fair', 'cross-section', 'America', 'interviewing', 'addicts', 'law', 'enforcement', 'others', 'who', 'clean', 'up', 'otherwise', 'try', 'alleviate', 'mess', 'Justin', 'Hunt', 'documentary', 'history', 'subject', 'drug', 'names', 'who', 'invented', 'refined', 'snippets', 'fact', 'Hitler', 'was', 'regular', 'user', 'also', 'outstanding', 'rundown', 'meth', 'ingredients', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'including', 'lithium', 'batteries', 'lightbulbs', 'Unfortunately', 'narrative', 'hits', 'wall', 'form', 'James', 'Holly', 'two', 'excuse-making', 'addicts', 'show', 'reality', 'tv', 'strongly', 'Big', 'Brother', 'shot', 'double-wide', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'four', 'children', 'involved', 'males', 'sporting', 'outrageous', 'mullets', 'much', 'yelling', 'waving', 'arms', 'awkwardly', 'subtitled', 'way', 'explaining', 'argument', 'counteraccusation', 'was', 'STOP', 'button', 'Threaded', 'documentary', 'available', 'separately', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'redeeming', 'feature', 'can', 'take', 'Documentarian', 'Justin', 'Hunt', 'will', 'learn', 'first', 'venture', 'will', 'be', 'back', 'future', 'greater', 'things']",American Meth
