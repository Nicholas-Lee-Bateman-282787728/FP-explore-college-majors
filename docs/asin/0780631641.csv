I had seen it before and had enjoyed it.  I wasn't expecting to enjoy it the second time around with all of the the surprises already known.  However, I didn't start reading my book or sneak a peak at the iPad.  I once again became engrossed in a redemption story.  Each actor played his/her part as needed.  I would have liked some more of the interaction between Laura Linney and Ed Harris, they brought some much needed comic relief with their flirtation. Gene Hackman as the jaded president was a joy to hate.  He made my skin crawl with his smile.  And Clint well, he was Clint.

38643,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0780631641,Acute Observer,"[1, 2]","Absolute Power, 1997 filmThe film begins in a museum. Artists are sketching. Luther enters a bar, then returns home. What will he do at night? How does he know about that secret room? But he hears a slight noise and hides. An older man and a young woman walk into the room. Later there is a struggle. Two guards end the fight. ""What the hell is that?"" ""Nothing we haven't heard before."" They clean up the mess. They will blame a burglar. The burglar escapes the house but not detection; he is able to outrun younger men in top shape. Did they get the plate number? The blood spatter tells about the crime. Strangle then shoot her at a distance from behind? Walter Sullivan tells about his relationship with his young wife. Later we see President Alan Richmond. ""Tennis elbow.""Luther gets new passports for his departure. The police continue the investigation. Two different bullets? Sullivan hires a private detective. The police list the top burglars in the country, only one is in Washington. Police detective Seth Frank questions Luther about the crime. Sullivan was a backer of the president. Miss Kate Whitney is a Prosecutor but knows little about Luther. Can she help bring him in? Will Luther believe her? The trap is set. Are there snipers waiting? Will the plan fail? Luther planned ahead. He tells his daughter what happened. What will he do? ""Its dangerous outside."" Miss Russell gets a gift. Will the Secret Service guard Kate Whitney? Will there be a car chase to provide action? Is the hospital room safe? ""That was unacceptable."" Will Luther confess to Walter Sullivan? What will he do? [The ending is ambiguous.] The news media report the tragedy in the White House. ""I'm still here."" Will they be just fine?This, like some other Eastwood movies, seems to run on too long. Would a president go on a Top Secret Mission with only two guards? Would the Secret Service cover up a major felony by the president? No, this is the flaw in the story. A talented and moral burglar who returns millions in loot? Could a Federal Prosecutor have a father who was a career criminal? This is a fantasy that has a hidden agenda.

38645,A2LM34XFKBHUKN,0780631641,"Amazon Customer ""bandzero""","[0, 1]","***Seriously, several plot spoilers are below.Even if the plot is rather fantastic, its premise has an allure -- what would you do if you were an eyewitness to a felonious act committed by the President, and everyone else who was there was committed to covering it up??That said, there were moments in the film that defied sense even in the movie's own terms. For example, Gloria Russel notices that the letter opener was left upstairs and sends the SS (Secret Service) back to fetch it. But why did they approach the room of the crime warily and with guns drawn? They had no expectation that anyone else was there (except the corpse). Eastwood, the director, was using an ordinary trick to make it ""suspenseful"", even though the trick made no sense.Speaking of suspense, why do would-be snipers (and their directors) have to laboriously snick and click their long-range rifles as they assemble them? This device is old, hoary and irritating (as are the directors who have to over-amplify the sound). But again, an easy trick to build suspense. Except we viewers have to view it twice, once for each sniper.(warning - spoiler) I get why the first sniper was spooked by the reflecting glass. But why was the second? I suppose the second was startled by the first's gun shot. But wait, both are consummate professionals, used to taking tough shots under stressful situations. We saw the second at the target range put 5-6 rounds in a 3 inch circle at 100 hundred yards, standing up! And he was, we suppose, out of practice (why else would he have been at the target range?). But then, both snipers were pros, with years of tough experience. Neither would have been spooked!! In ""the real"" reality. That's what their training is about. And don't get me started with the first sniper's sticking the barrel of the rifle wayyyy out the window. How's that for inviting detection!!! Nor would he do something as none-productive as firing dry rounds at various persons before Luther comes. But, of course, director Eastwood needs some (cheesy) way to amp up the suspense.And say, why were there only two Secret Service men around? Where was their commander?? I mean, they are in a serious ""situation"" here, and in the other reality, namely, real life, they would have gone to their commander for direction and support. (Since the white SS guy was especially conflicted by the situation.)Finally, (definite spoiler alert), the movie's ending. Character Walter Sullivan looked rather frail in the movie, walking with a cane. The audience is supposed to believe that he overpowered Mr. XXX in a knife fight??!! And since we viewers are all trained criminologists (having graduated from 300 hours of watching Law and Order), we all know about entry wounds, angle of attack, and likely traces of blood on WS after his fight. And we know how CAREFULLY(!!!!) the death of XXX would have been reconstructed. Yet the White House staff conveniently accepts the verdict of suicide by knife (rather a demanding way to do it, unless you are samurai, and from a president who appears otherwise rather chipper, happy, content).Altogether, this movie had a nice premise, but for me was rather spoiled by a ham-fisted director playing to the cheap seats.",2,The director: playing to the cheap seats,1375574400,"08 4, 2013",2013,3228,"['***Seriously', 'several', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'are', 'below.Even', 'plot', 'rather', 'fantastic', 'premise', 'allure', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'were', 'eyewitness', 'felonious', 'act', 'committed', 'President', 'everyone', 'else', 'who', 'was', 'was', 'committed', 'covering', 'up', 'said', 'were', 'moments', 'film', 'defied', 'sense', 'even', 'movie', 'own', 'terms', 'example', 'Gloria', 'Russel', 'letter', 'opener', 'was', 'left', 'upstairs', 'SS', 'Secret', 'Service', 'back', 'fetch', 'why', 'did', 'approach', 'room', 'crime', 'warily', 'guns', 'drawn', 'had', 'expectation', 'anyone', 'else', 'was', 'corpse', 'Eastwood', 'director', 'was', 'using', 'ordinary', 'trick', 'make', 'suspenseful', 'even', 'trick', 'made', 'sense.Speaking', 'suspense', 'why', 'do', 'would-be', 'snipers', 'directors', 'have', 'laboriously', 'snick', 'click', 'long-range', 'rifles', 'assemble', 'device', 'old', 'hoary', 'irritating', 'are', 'directors', 'who', 'have', 'over-amplify', 'sound', 'again', 'easy', 'trick', 'build', 'suspense', 'viewers', 'have', 'view', 'twice', 'once', 'sniper', 'warning', 'spoiler', 'get', 'why', 'first', 'sniper', 'was', 'spooked', 'reflecting', 'glass', 'why', 'was', 'second', 'suppose', 'second', 'was', 'startled', 'first', 'gun', 'shot', 'wait', 'are', 'consummate', 'professionals', 'used', 'taking', 'tough', 'shots', 'stressful', 'situations', 'saw', 'second', 'target', 'range', 'put', '5-6', 'rounds', '3', 'inch', 'circle', '100', 'hundred', 'yards', 'standing', 'up', 'was', 'suppose', 'practice', 'why', 'else', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'target', 'range', 'then', 'snipers', 'were', 'pros', 'years', 'tough', 'experience', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'spooked', 'real', 'reality', 'what', 'training', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'started', 'first', 'sniper', 'sticking', 'barrel', 'rifle', 'out', 'window', 'How', 'inviting', 'detection', 'would', 'do', 'something', 'as', 'none-productive', 'firing', 'dry', 'rounds', 'various', 'persons', 'Luther', 'course', 'director', 'Eastwood', 'cheesy', 'way', 'amp', 'up', 'suspense.And', 'say', 'why', 'were', 'only', 'two', 'Secret', 'Service', 'men', 'Where', 'was', 'commander', 'mean', 'are', 'serious', 'situation', 'here', 'other', 'reality', 'namely', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'commander', 'direction', 'support', 'white', 'SS', 'guy', 'was', 'especially', 'conflicted', 'situation', 'Finally', 'definite', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'movie', 'ending', 'Character', 'Walter', 'Sullivan', 'looked', 'rather', 'frail', 'movie', 'walking', 'cane', 'audience', 'supposed', 'believe', 'overpowered', 'Mr.', 'XXX', 'knife', 'fight', 'viewers', 'are', 'trained', 'criminologists', 'having', 'graduated', '300', 'hours', 'watching', 'Law', 'Order', 'know', 'entry', 'wounds', 'angle', 'attack', 'likely', 'traces', 'blood', 'WS', 'fight', 'know', 'how', 'CAREFULLY', 'death', 'XXX', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'reconstructed', 'White', 'House', 'staff', 'conveniently', 'verdict', 'suicide', 'knife', 'rather', 'demanding', 'way', 'do', 'are', 'samurai', 'president', 'who', 'otherwise', 'rather', 'chipper', 'happy', 'content', '.Altogether', 'movie', 'had', 'nice', 'premise', 'was', 'rather', 'spoiled', 'ham-fisted', 'director', 'playing', 'cheap', 'seats']",N/A

I have no dissent about the acting whatsoever, but Absolute Power is particularly weak for its overall shape of the story. While it may be ingenious enough, the way Clint Eastwood directed turned Absolute Power to be a very mediocre picture with nothing much to show, at least on any entertainment level. It's just an ""oh"" for me. Certainly, I have seen much better works from Eastwood including Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby, Bronco Billy, The Gauntlet, Play Misty for Me, Sudden Impact, and Space Cowboys. And to be sure again, he has acted better in other movies as well. Absolute Power isn't a disappointment but could have been done a lot better. I'm surprised how caricature the Chief of Staff acted when I was expecting her to be very professional in terms of mannerism while reacting to the scandal and handling the cover-up. The Secret Service men looked like jokes, and they would have been spotted rather quickly by the investigating homicide team. I know that Scott Glenn is a much better actor than this.

38649,A2582KMXLK2P06,0780631641,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","Right now I'm kicking myself for spending so many years ignoring a huge pile of classic Clint Eastwood films... and I'm not even sure whether Absolute Power qualifies as a classic. With just under 80 reviews here on amazon, I imagine not. Oh well, I thoroughly enjoyed it and that's the only thing that really matters.It's about Clint Eastwood playing the character of a professional jewelry thief who breaks into a museum/mansion one night and carefully plots through all the clever devices designed to protect the expensive jewels. However, once he arrives to an upstairs bedroom, he hears someone coming through the door...It's actually two people- a man (the president of the United States) and a woman. Well you can pretty much guess why they're breaking into a bedroom- to showcase a little late night action! Meanwhile Clint's hiding in a closet nearby watching the entire scene take place. Unfortunately for the woman, the man has a vicious and abusive side that soon reveals itself much to the chagrin of the woman.What happens next is honestly *extremely* shocking and I don't want to spill the storyline beans so to speak- just realize that the entire 30 minutes in the beginning is quite entertaining for action fans. In fact, this film is mostly about action and suspense, and little of the plotline has to do with politics. It's a ""How will Clint find a clever way out of THIS mess?"" kind of storyline. Once his daughter enters the picture, the plot thickens. It's awesome.By the way, a couple actors and actresses from that hit TV show 24 make an appearance here.  I'm referring to the guy who portrays the president (Dennis Haysbert, better known as David Palmer) and his wife (who appeared in the earlier years of the shows existence) are both major characters in Absolute Power, and it makes me wonder if the writers of 24 hired them specifically because of their excellent performance in this movie.Everything about this film is just spectacular. Clint Eastwood has the same old facial expressions that we've come to love, he of course narrowly (and miraculously) escapes a few life or death situations, he takes advantage of his jewelry-stealing skills to send the cops running off in another direction, and the movie is just fantastic the entire way through so I highly recommend it.",5,another Clint goodie,1320537600,"11 6, 2011",2011,2304,"['Right', 'now', ""'m"", 'kicking', 'spending', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'ignoring', 'huge', 'pile', 'classic', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'films', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'Absolute', 'Power', 'qualifies', 'classic', 'just', '80', 'reviews', 'here', 'amazon', 'imagine', 'not', 'Oh', 'well', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'matters.It', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'playing', 'character', 'professional', 'jewelry', 'thief', 'who', 'museum/mansion', 'one', 'night', 'carefully', 'plots', 'clever', 'devices', 'designed', 'protect', 'expensive', 'jewels', 'However', 'once', 'upstairs', 'bedroom', 'someone', 'coming', 'door', 'actually', 'two', 'people-', 'man', 'president', 'United', 'States', 'woman', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'guess', 'why', ""'re"", 'breaking', 'bedroom-', 'showcase', 'little', 'late', 'night', 'action', 'Meanwhile', 'Clint', 'hiding', 'closet', 'nearby', 'watching', 'entire', 'scene', 'take', 'place', 'Unfortunately', 'woman', 'man', 'vicious', 'abusive', 'side', 'soon', 'much', 'chagrin', 'woman.What', 'next', 'honestly', '*extremely*', 'shocking', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spill', 'storyline', 'beans', 'so', 'speak-', 'just', 'realize', 'entire', '30', 'minutes', 'beginning', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'action', 'fans', 'fact', 'film', 'mostly', 'action', 'suspense', 'little', 'plotline', 'do', 'politics', 'How', 'will', 'Clint', 'find', 'clever', 'way', 'THIS', 'mess', 'kind', 'storyline', 'daughter', 'picture', 'plot', 'way', 'couple', 'actors', 'actresses', 'hit', 'TV', 'show', '24', 'make', 'appearance', 'here', ""'m"", 'referring', 'guy', 'who', 'president', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'better', 'known', 'David', 'Palmer', 'wife', 'who', 'appeared', 'earlier', 'years', 'shows', 'existence', 'are', 'major', 'characters', 'Absolute', 'Power', 'wonder', 'writers', '24', 'hired', 'specifically', 'excellent', 'performance', 'movie.Everything', 'film', 'just', 'spectacular', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'same', 'old', 'facial', 'expressions', ""'ve"", 'come', 'love', 'course', 'narrowly', 'miraculously', 'few', 'life', 'death', 'situations', 'advantage', 'jewelry-stealing', 'skills', 'send', 'cops', 'running', 'off', 'direction', 'movie', 'just', 'fantastic', 'entire', 'way', 'so', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

Shirley said in the headline of her review for this, it's ""Clint vs. The White House...Who Will Win?...Well, You Know!""This is your typical Clint Eastwood character--not someone especially filled with virtue--especially the virtue we'd expect to find in a hero. He is his usual rough, cantankerous, ""do not bother me"" and ""do not bother with me"" loner that he is so good at portraying. Falling back on his skill as one of the top six known thieves, in the midst of a huge heist he finds himself face-to-face with being a witness to murder by the US President and two of his Secret Service agents. Although his initial instinct is to run and skip the country, his sense of justice for the victim and the criminal, that he has always portrayed in his own peculiar way, keeps him set as he unravels the ""how to"" bring the President and his staff to justice. He makes progress in a way that Washington never could or would with such an issue, as we are witnessing! It's all filled with suspense--something he does so well, especially as Director. It seems a good morale-booster also at this time.His somewhat heartless attitude towards life, family, etc. gets overcome in the process of this whole affair. What could be seen as cynical and selfish, with obvious shortage of affection in the sparse interactions that have made up his relationship with his daughter over decades, kind of explodes into the deep moving love for her that has remained hidden, but now has the opportunity to move to the surface. Yeah! The same kind of smokescreen we've seen before, but when cleared away reveals his true character, and what his ultimate priorities and values are.It's a great movie. It's a thriller!

38661,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,0780631641,C. O. DeRiemer,"[2, 3]","So the president of the United States may not be the nicest guy in the world. Well, we've known that can be the case since 1789. So the idea of our presidents engaging in sexual shenanigans may be as uncomfortable as realizing our parents do it. Well, we've learned more than we want to know over the last few decades about how our presidents spend their time when they aren't bringing peace to the world and ensuring our domestic tranquility. One of the reasons Absolute Power is such a fine thriller is that it involves the dirty doings -- murder, cover-ups, self-serving righteousness -- of those in high elected office.Absolute Power is the story of Luther Whitney (Clint Eastwood), ""one of the great thieves of the world,"" who breaks into the mansion of Walter Sullivan (E. G. Marshall), a very rich, very powerful and very old political kingmaker. But then Luther hears voices and has to hide in a bedroom vault with a one-way mirror. He has to watch the rough sex between the rich man's much younger wife and a friend of hers. When things get out of hand and she angrily starts to do some stabbing, suddenly two very competent men break in and shoot the lady dead. They're followed by an aggressively competent woman who proceeds to clean things up and spin a story that a thief must have killed the lady of the house. Luther comes to realize that the two shooters are Secret Service agents, the competent woman is Gloria Russell (Judy Davis), the president's chief of staff, and the man is Allen Richmond (Gene Hackman), the unscrupulous president of the U. S. Luther is spotted and barely escapes but Russell and the two agents manage to identify him. They also learn he has an estranged daughter, Kate Whitney (Laura Linney), a young prosecutor. At first Luther decides to take his accrued wealth and flee the country. Then he sees a press conference on television where Richmond uses the grief-stricken Sullivan, who made him president, in a smarmy soap opera of shared grief. Luther changes his mind and decides to see that justice is done. Luther's brand of justice is resourceful, clever and dangerous. All the while he has to deal with an honest homicide cop, Seth Frank (Ed Harris), who is on his trail, an assassin hired by Sullivan to kill whoever killed his wife, and the machinations of Gloria Russell, determined to shield Richmond, aided by the two Secret Service agents. One, Bill Burton (Scott Glenn), has a conscience. The other, Tim Collin (Dennis Haysbert), does not.Eastwood and writer William Goldman have, in my opinion, concocted a fine, intelligent thriller that plays off Eastman's age (""Go down a rope in the middle of the night? If I could do that, I'd be the star of my AARP meetings.""), gives us some fine set pieces (the break-in, killing and cleaning up; the attempt on Luther's life by two separate assassins when he meets his daughter; and the wonderfully played dance at a White House ball between Hackman and Davis) and which is told at a more-or-less human-sized scale. While I think perhaps too much time was spent on the relationship between Luther and his daughter, it's this relationship, well acted between Eastman and Linney, that helps raise the movie beyond just another thriller.Three things make this movie so good. First, there are two sets of intriguing relationships, one of which is poignant and tender, the other almost grotesquely amusing. The Eastwood-Linney situation is the first. And then there is the Allen Richmond-Gloria Russell pas de dieux. He depends on her but we know he'd toss her out in a minute if he needed to. She depends on him, probably loves him, and would gut her mother to protect him and her power (""I'll take care of everything. Like I always do.""). It's fascinating, especially as played out by Hackman and Davis. Their White House waltz at the ball, where Davis is coy because she thinks the necklace she received was a present from Richmond, and Richmond knows, and tells her, that the necklace was the one worn by Sullivan's wife and that it had to have come from Luther Whitney, is a classic lesson in acting. The two of them play every emotion you can think of, all the while dancing in close-up and smiling for the admiring guests. The scene is a tour de force and immensely funny.Second, this movie is so good for what Eastwood and Goldman don't do. This is a thriller without explosions, without wild car chases and without star posing. We're left to focus on the story, on the intelligence of the dialogue, on the cleverness of the situation. As Roger Ebert said, ""it's a thriller not upstaged by its thrills.""Third, and most importantly, is the casting. The impact of the movie primarily rests with Eastwood, Hackman and Davis. Each one has shown many times that they can carry a movie by themselves. Judy Davis is the least known and has been stuck in character roles for years. However, just watch her in My Brilliant Career, A Passage to India or Children of the Revolution to see an actress who can dominate a movie. The second tier, made up of Ed Harris, E. G. Marshall, Laura Linney, Scott Glenn and Dennis Haysbert are just as effective. These are experienced actors who work well together and who know how to deliver their stuff. E. G. Marshall at 83 gives a performance that combines great sadness with an implacable sense of retribution. And Scott Glenn, such a good actor who has slowly slipped down to smaller, secondary roles, gives a performance of such regret it nearly distracts us from the story.The movie is in real need of a better release. The picture is consistently too soft and frequently too dark in the night-time and interior scenes. There are a couple of inconsequential extras.",4,"A fine, intelligent thriller, with thanks to Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman and Judy Davis, among others",1181433600,"06 10,

He is the witness of a crime but stays invisible behind a mirror, he  is a burglar at night and a painter during the day.

You almost hope he pulls off the big heist and gets away with it and lives happily ever after because he is Clint.  If you can accept the fact that this plot borders on total fantasy, could never happen and defies logic time and time again, you will enjoy the scenario.  Lennie Niehaus' film score is perfect in creating the eery and sinister mood throughout the film and Clint's own playing of the piano theme is beautiful and haunting.  Gene Hackman as the president is truly the screen's best on screen bad guy and Ed Harris is his usual natural and believable self as the ""live alone"" head detective.  With that being said you must ask yourself: Why and how were the president's trysts unaccounted for by his staff and the media?  When E.G. Marshall's wife was murdered there was apparently no investigation even though he was very prominent.  When Clint met his daughter at the outside cafe the whole area was surrounded by police but apparently Clint didn't see any of them.  When the secret service man was killed in the hospital apparently no questions were asked and no investigation took place and Clint was never a suspect.  When the president presumably committed suicide E.G. Marshall was never suspected even though he was the only witness and no questions were asked why the president fatally stabbed himself at that specific time.

A strong cast, including Gene Hackman, E.G. Marshall, Ed Harris, Scott Glen, Dennis Haysbert, and Laura Linney, carries the movie.As the story opens, master thief Luther Whitney (Eastwood) inadvertantly witnesses the shooting death by the Secret Service of a politically-connected young woman, after her tryst with a sadistic president (Hackman) goes badly.  Whitney escapes, to be targeted by the Secret Service.  The leading DC detective on the case (Harris) and Prosecutor (Linney) develop their doubts about the ""official"" version of the crime, only to discover the Secret Secret is dogging their footsteps with a different agenda.  Linney's prosecutor finds her situation compromised by her status as Luther's estranged daughter.  Luther Whitney will have to find a way to stay alive and free long enough to implicate the real killer, while minimizing the collateral damage.""Absolute Power"" creates its suspense through a clever if rather implausible plot and nuanced performances by the cast.

I was certainly not the target audience but it had my attention from the first scene and maintained the suspense for the during of the running time, even if it doesn't build to much.Clint Eastwood plays Luther Whitney, an expert thief who targets billionaire industrialist Walter Sullivan (grouchy old EG Marshall, in his last theatrical movie) while he is off on vacation. While in the midst of cleaning out the vault the President of the United States (Gene Hackman) enters the room with Sullivan's wife. Whitney hides in the vault, which has a two-way mirror, and witnesses the President get a little too rough with the woman, which ends in her fighting him off and being murdered by the secret service. The Chief of Staff concocts a plan to cover up the murder not knowing that Whitney is watching the whole thing. As the group leave he escapes, taking a crucial piece of evidence with him.Initially unsure what to do, Whitney decides to taunt the President, though it's not clear what his complete plan is or even if he's just free-forming. If one should fault Absolute Power for any reason it's that it establishes a lot of plot and potential but never really does anything with it and ends with an anti-climactic cop-out.Where it succeeds is with the small cast of characters who really make the dialogue and relationships work. Ed Harris as the confused but dedicated cop investigating the case, Laura Linney as Whitney's resentful daughter, and the austere Scott Glenn as the self-doubting agent make every scene effortless even when there's not much happening.Adapted from (and streamlined and improved in the process) the bloated novel by David Baldacci (I call them 'Airport novels' - those 600-page bricks with generic covers featuring nothing but the title and author in giant gold letters in a tacky font) the screenplay makes many changes but they are all for the better.  Eastwood's direction is slow and steady - or 'mature'. The pace and framing is the antidote for anyone bored to tears with the nauseating aesthetic of today's comic-book movies and CGI nightmares.A curious thing about the beginning of the movie is that Clint Eastwood only has 2 lines of dialogue for the entire 35 minutes. I don't understand why he didn't cut them out and remain silent, which would give the film a peculiar edge.The Blu-ray features a fine 2.40 1080p transfer with an active, spatial DTS HD-MA soundtrack.

38694,A19JYLHD94K94D,0780631641,Itamar Katz,"[3, 4]","Absolute Power is not among Clint Eastwood greatest films, but it's much better than is usually given credit for. A dark thriller, directed as professionally and bleakly as only Eastwood can do it, Absolute Power centers around Luther Whitney, a professional burglar (Eastwood himself, in one of his best performances in the last decade), who finds himself in a classic wrong place, wrong time situation - while robbing a luxurious mansion, he accidentally witnesses a sexual assault and a murder, and the subsequent cover-up, that involves the President of the United States and the White House staff. That scene at the very beginning of the movie is probably the strongest one in it, Eastwood making brilliant use of cinematography, music (and especially the lack of) and his trademark heavy contrasted lighting, and with almost no dialogue at all, it's a remarkably effective scene that overshadows much of the rest of the film.Still, as the film turns into a more standard conspiracy-thriller, it holds its own quite well, mainly due to William Goldman's wonderful script (as his always are, this is the genius who wrote 'The Princess Bride', 'Marathon Man', 'Misery' and 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid', among others) and most of all thanks to the absolutely fantastic all-star cast; other than Clint himself, who is ideal as the charming, ruthless but honest criminal, fantastic performances are also given by Gene Hackman as the President and by Ed Harris as the detective on the case. The rest of the excellent cast includes Laura Linney ('Primal Fear') as Luther's daughter; the fantastic Judy Davis ('Naked Lunch', 'Barton Fink') as the President's sneaky assistant; Scott Glenn ('Buffalo Soldiers'); Dennis Haysbert ('Far From Heaven'); E.G. Marshall ('Tora! Tora! Tora!'); Penny Johnson ('24'); and Richard Jenkins ('Six Feet Under'). As is usually the case with Clint Eastwood's films, all the actors seem to have been hand-picked by him directly, rather than participated in an audition, because each character seems to have been designed specifically for the actor portraying them. Because of that cast and the brilliant directing and dialogue, Absolute Power is an entirely gripping watch, even if the story is at times less than entirely convincing and just a little fragmented.Absolute Power tries to make its mark on three levels - the thriller level is the only one where it completely succeeds, and it manages to be constantly exciting, gripping and enticing. It works slightly less well on the human level, because the inter-character relationships are rather poorly developed. Laura Linney's character in particular is underdeveloped, and so the father-daughter relationship element hardly carries any weight in the story, and neither does her relationship with Ed Harris's character. As there is no interaction between Eastwood's character and Hackman's, the only relationships that are worth mentioning are the ones between Eastwood and Harris, which is strictly superficial and based on mutual respect, and the one between Hackman and Marshall, who plays the old billionaire who funded Hackman's rise to the presidency. The third level on which the film works is as political commentary; there it achieves partial success, as the story often seems contrived (although, one might note, not as contrived as we may imagine). Still, it can give you a general idea of how absolute power corrupts, and of the kind of horrors that the intricate systems of democracy might hide; but it's not to be taken too literally. The strongest elements of the story are the mystery, and Clint Eastwood's character, clearly the strongest in the film; as such it's a solid and enticing thriller with lots of atmosphere and wonderful acting, that will keep you glued to your seat.",5,A solid thriller with a message,1130112000,"10 24, 2005",2005,3789,"['Absolute', 'Power', 'not', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'greatest', 'films', 'much', 'better', 'usually', 'given', 'credit', 'dark', 'thriller', 'directed', 'professionally', 'bleakly', 'only', 'Eastwood', 'can', 'do', 'Absolute', 'Power', 'centers', 'Luther', 'Whitney', 'professional', 'burglar', 'Eastwood', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'last', 'decade', 'who', 'classic', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'situation', 'robbing', 'luxurious', 'mansion', 'accidentally', 'sexual', 'assault', 'murder', 'subsequent', 'cover-up', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'White', 'House', 'staff', 'scene', 'very', 'beginning', 'movie', 'probably', 'strongest', 'one', 'Eastwood', 'making', 'brilliant', 'use', 'cinematography', 'music', 'especially', 'lack', 'trademark', 'heavy', 'contrasted', 'lighting', 'almost', 'dialogue', 'remarkably', 'effective', 'scene', 'much', 'rest', 'film.Still', 'film', 'more', 'standard', 'conspiracy-thriller', 'own', 'quite', 'well', 'mainly', 'due', 'William', 'Goldman', 'wonderful', 'script', 'always', 'are', 'genius', 'who', 'wrote', ""'The"", 'Princess', 'Bride', 'Man', ""'Misery"", 'Cassidy', 'Sundance', 'Kid', 'others', 'most', 'thanks', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'all-star', 'cast', 'other', 'Clint', 'who', 'ideal', 'charming', 'ruthless', 'honest', 'criminal', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'are', 'also', 'given', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'President', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'detective', 'case', 'rest', 'excellent', 'cast', 'Laura', 'Linney', ""'Primal"", 'Fear', 'Luther', 'daughter', 'fantastic', 'Judy', 'Davis', ""'Naked"", 'Lunch', 'Fink', 'President', 'sneaky', 'assistant', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'Soldiers', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', ""'Far"", 'Heaven', 'E.G', 'Marshall', 'Tora', 'Tora', 'Penny', 'Johnson', ""'24"", 'Richard', 'Jenkins', ""'Six"", 'Feet', 'usually', 'case', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'films', 'actors', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'hand-picked', 'directly', 'rather', 'participated', 'audition', 'character', 'have', 'been', 'designed', 'specifically', 'actor', 'portraying', 'cast', 'brilliant', 'directing', 'dialogue', 'Absolute', 'Power', 'entirely', 'gripping', 'watch', 'even', 'story', 'times', 'less', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'just', 'little', 'fragmented.Absolute', 'Power', 'tries', 'make', 'mark', 'three', 'levels', 'thriller', 'level', 'only', 'one', 'where', 'completely', 'be', 'constantly', 'exciting', 'gripping', 'enticing', 'slightly', 'less', 'well', 'human', 'level', 'inter-character', 'relationships', 'are', 'rather', 'poorly', 'developed', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'character', 'particular', 'underdeveloped', 'so', 'father-daughter', 'relationship', 'element', 'hardly', 'weight', 'story', 'neither', 'relationship', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'character', 'interaction', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'Hackman', 'only', 'relationships', 'are', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'are', 'ones', 'Eastwood', 'Harris', 'strictly', 'superficial', 'based', 'mutual', 'respect', 'one', 'Hackman', 'Marshall', 'who', 'old', 'billionaire', 'who', 'funded', 'Hackman', 'rise', 'presidency', 'third', 'level', 'film', 'as', 'political', 'commentary', 'partial', 'success', 'story', 'often', 'contrived', 'one', 'might', 'note', 'not', 'as', 'contrived', 'may', 'imagine', 'Still', 'can', 'give', 'general', 'idea', 'how', 'absolute', 'power', 'corrupts', 'kind', 'horrors', 'intricate', 'systems', 'democracy', 'might', 'hide', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'too', 'literally', 'strongest', 'elements', 'story', 'are', 'mystery', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'clearly', 'strongest', 'film', 'such', 'solid', 'enticing', 'thriller', 'lots', 'atmosphere', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'will', 'keep', 'glued', 'seat']",N/A

The film is good at showing how things could be hushed up in the USA, and in fact cannot. They always try but they mostly and most often fail, because there is a fink or a mole somewhere. Luckily for us. Though they are quite better at hushing up a crime that has to do with something more serious than a sexual offense, even accompanied with murder. For example the lying and the forging of evidence, necessarily false then, like with a certain George W Bush. Or deciding not to count millions of votes that would give the victory to the one they don't want like with Al Gore. The weakness of the film is also the key to its ending. The use of the husband of the girl who is killed, a quite old man indeed, and the main supporter of the President. This reveals the completely mentally deranged psychology of this President, of his main supporter and of the system they are living in. The suicide of the President is not an act of justice, but only an act to escape justice. No one, not even the President, has the right to evade justice and make his own justice, even on himself. The role of the police, when they know, which is the case here, is not to close their eyes on that kind of en ending, or to cover up another more radical ending for the unwanted witness of the crime, but to arrest the murderer and prevent him from escaping normal justice, which is the justice of the people, for the people and by the people and not justice for only individual, to quote the Gettysburg address.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID",4,It should have been a lot stronger,1277164800,"06 22, 2010",2010,1886,"['political', 'thriller', 'involving', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'sexual', 'crime', 'fact', 'radical', 'crime', 'line', 'viz', 'murder', 'right', 'middle', 'Lewinski', 'affair', 'provocation', 'type', 'suicide', 'President', 'film', 'good', 'showing', 'how', 'things', 'could', 'be', 'hushed', 'up', 'USA', 'fact', 'can', 'not', 'always', 'try', 'mostly', 'most', 'often', 'fail', 'fink', 'mole', 'somewhere', 'Luckily', 'are', 'quite', 'better', 'hushing', 'up', 'crime', 'do', 'something', 'more', 'serious', 'sexual', 'offense', 'even', 'accompanied', 'murder', 'example', 'lying', 'forging', 'evidence', 'necessarily', 'false', 'then', 'certain', 'George', 'W', 'Bush', 'deciding', 'not', 'count', 'millions', 'votes', 'would', 'give', 'victory', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'Al', 'Gore', 'weakness', 'film', 'also', 'key', 'ending', 'use', 'husband', 'girl', 'who', 'killed', 'quite', 'old', 'man', 'indeed', 'main', 'supporter', 'President', 'completely', 'mentally', 'deranged', 'psychology', 'President', 'main', 'supporter', 'system', 'are', 'living', 'suicide', 'President', 'not', 'act', 'justice', 'only', 'act', 'escape', 'justice', 'one', 'not', 'even', 'President', 'right', 'evade', 'justice', 'make', 'own', 'justice', 'even', 'role', 'police', 'when', 'know', 'case', 'here', 'not', 'close', 'eyes', 'kind', 'en', 'ending', 'cover', 'up', 'more', 'radical', 'ending', 'unwanted', 'witness', 'crime', 'arrest', 'murderer', 'prevent', 'escaping', 'normal', 'justice', 'justice', 'people', 'people', 'people', 'not', 'justice', 'only', 'individual', 'quote', 'Gettysburg', 'address.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Paris', '8', 'Saint', 'Denis', 'University', 'Paris', '12', 'Cr', 'eacute', 'CEGID']",N/A

38705,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0780631641,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[48, 54]","At the start of &quot;Absolute Power&quot; Luther Whitne (Clint Eastwood), cat burglar par excellence, finds himself in a very strange situation.  While robbing a rich man's safe in a large bedroom closet, he is interrupted by the appearance of a man and woman who head straight for the bed.  While hiding in the closet, where he sees what is going on through a two-way mirror, he watches while the sex play gets rough: the man hits her, she stabs him with a letter opener, and then two men come into the room and shoot her.  Luther gets out of there, but while his presence was undetected it does not go undiscovered.  The problem is that the man he was watching happens to be the President of the United States (Gene Hackman).Now, I have to stop at this point and tell you that one of my cinematic pet peeves is the idea that the United States Secret Service will let the president do anything, no matter how stupid or reckless, without batting an eye.  Indeed, in &quot;Absolute Power&quot; there are two such agents, who help to cover up the murder and then try to track down Luther and kill him.  However, the actors playing those two agents happen to be Scott Glenn and Dennis Haysbert, which is an important fact because a lot of the faults in this film area absolved by the casting, the credit for which goes to the film's director: Clint Eastwood.The hook for this thriller is the idea that the president, his Chief of Staff (Judy Davis), and the Secret Service are out to get Luther, whose stated intention is to get out of town and get lost as quick as possible.  But the key to this film ends up being a rather odd romantic triangle that exists between Luther, his estranged daughter, Kate (Laura Linney), and the D.C. homicide cop, Seth Frank (Ed Harris), who is assigned to the murder.  Frank interviews Luther, not because he thinks the old con is a murderer, but because he is one of the few that could have pulled off the heist.  He then moves on to Kate, hoping to get her to persuade her father to turn himself in before the wrath of the rich man (E.G. Marshall) whose wife is dead comes crashing down on him.  Frank clearly likes Kate and is rather impressed by Luther, which is good because I like smart cops.  For his part, Luther clearly has some admiration for the detective and also likes his taste in women.My favorite scene in this movie is when Frank takes Kate to her father's house, where she has never been, and (knowing where Luther hides the key), takes her inside.  In one room she finds a gallery of photographs, of all of the key moments in her life after her father left.  &quot;She was at none of these,&quot; she insists to Frank, although clearly that was never the case and we can see in an instant that she is rethinking her entire relationship with her father.  As much as it is fun to watch Luther outsmart the cops, the Secret Service, and the hitman sent by old man Sullivan, the heart of this film is between Luther and Kate.  Even when she sets him up, believing it to be the only way of helping keep her father alive, he surprises her by showing up.  His reasoning?  He did not want her to believe he was a murderer.  Besides, his daughter wanted to see him.I understand the script by William Goldman is quite different from David Balducci's novel, but that simply has to do with Eastwood playing Luther (if you read the novel you will understand why this would matter in terms of the significant changes).  Eastwood's direction is competent as always, and, as I mentioned above, he gets the credit for being able to bring together such a solid cast for one of his projects (who would turn down a Clint Eastwood movie?).  Final Note: the White House Tour Guide is played by the director's daughter, Kimber Eastwood.",4,A political thriller but also a strong father-daughter story,1074643200,"01 21, 2004",2004,3764,"['start', 'quot', 'Absolute', 'Power', 'quot', 'Luther', 'Whitne', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'cat', 'burglar', 'par', 'excellence', 'very', 'strange', 'situation', 'robbing', 'rich', 'man', 'safe', 'large', 'bedroom', 'closet', 'interrupted', 'appearance', 'man', 'woman', 'who', 'head', 'straight', 'bed', 'hiding', 'closet', 'where', 'what', 'going', 'two-way', 'mirror', 'sex', 'play', 'rough', 'man', 'stabs', 'letter', 'opener', 'then', 'two', 'men', 'come', 'room', 'shoot', 'Luther', 'presence', 'was', 'undetected', 'not', 'go', 'undiscovered', 'problem', 'man', 'was', 'watching', 'happens', 'be', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'Gene', 'Hackman', '.Now', 'have', 'stop', 'point', 'tell', 'one', 'cinematic', 'pet', 'peeves', 'idea', 'United', 'States', 'Secret', 'Service', 'will', 'let', 'president', 'do', 'anything', 'matter', 'how', 'stupid', 'reckless', 'batting', 'eye', 'Indeed', 'quot', 'Absolute', 'Power', 'quot', 'are', 'two', 'such', 'agents', 'who', 'help', 'cover', 'up', 'murder', 'then', 'try', 'track', 'down', 'Luther', 'kill', 'However', 'actors', 'playing', 'two', 'agents', 'happen', 'be', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'important', 'fact', 'lot', 'faults', 'film', 'area', 'absolved', 'casting', 'credit', 'film', 'director', 'Clint', 'Eastwood.The', 'hook', 'thriller', 'idea', 'president', 'Chief', 'Staff', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'Secret', 'Service', 'are', 'out', 'get', 'Luther', 'stated', 'intention', 'get', 'town', 'get', 'lost', 'as', 'quick', 'possible', 'key', 'film', 'up', 'being', 'rather', 'odd', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'Luther', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'Kate', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'D.C.', 'homicide', 'cop', 'Seth', 'Frank', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'who', 'assigned', 'murder', 'Frank', 'Luther', 'not', 'old', 'con', 'murderer', 'one', 'few', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'heist', 'then', 'Kate', 'hoping', 'get', 'persuade', 'father', 'turn', 'wrath', 'rich', 'man', 'E.G', 'Marshall', 'wife', 'dead', 'crashing', 'down', 'Frank', 'clearly', 'Kate', 'rather', 'impressed', 'Luther', 'good', 'like', 'smart', 'cops', 'part', 'Luther', 'clearly', 'admiration', 'detective', 'also', 'taste', 'women.My', 'favorite', 'scene', 'movie', 'when', 'Frank', 'Kate', 'father', 'house', 'where', 'never', 'been', 'knowing', 'where', 'Luther', 'key', 'inside', 'one', 'room', 'gallery', 'photographs', 'key', 'moments', 'life', 'father', 'left', 'quot', 'was', 'none', 'quot', 'Frank', 'clearly', 'was', 'never', 'case', 'can', 'see', 'instant', 'rethinking', 'entire', 'relationship', 'father', 'As', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'Luther', 'outsmart', 'cops', 'Secret', 'Service', 'hitman', 'sent', 'old', 'man', 'Sullivan', 'heart', 'film', 'Luther', 'Kate', 'Even', 'when', 'sets', 'up', 'believing', 'be', 'only', 'way', 'helping', 'keep', 'father', 'alive', 'showing', 'up', 'reasoning', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'believe', 'was', 'murderer', 'daughter', 'wanted', 'see', 'him.I', 'understand', 'script', 'William', 'Goldman', 'quite', 'different', 'David', 'Balducci', 'novel', 'simply', 'do', 'Eastwood', 'playing', 'Luther', 'read', 'novel', 'will', 'understand', 'why', 'would', 'matter', 'terms', 'significant', 'changes', 'Eastwood', 'direction', 'competent', 'always', 'mentioned', 'above', 'credit', 'being', 'able', 'bring', 'together', 'such', 'solid', 'cast', 'one', 'projects', 'who', 'would', 'turn', 'down', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'movie', 'Final', 'Note', 'White', 'House', 'Tour', 'Guide', 'played', 'director', 'daughter', 'Kimber', 'Eastwood']",N/A

Eastwood the director is much better than Eastwood the actor, and there are times I wish he'd cast others in the roles he takes.  But that aside, this political thriller soars because of the wonderful actors and the way Clint works with them to bring out the best, even in smaller, seemingly insignificant scenes.  Let's look at some of these performances:GENE HACKMAN - an outstanding actor who always gives a hundred percent doesn't get a lot of screen time in this one, but of course his scenes are pivotal and his ability to create such a devious and self-centered liar are brilliant.LAURA LINNEY - one of our most consistently good actresses, Laura takes the cliche role of abandoned daughter, but fills it with the hurt that comes from that; the love that still wants to get out, and her devotion to the man she feels abandoned her.  Her scene with Ed Harris in which she goes to her father's apartment and sees all the pictures is wonderful.ED HARRIS - he plays a smart cop and an attractive, lonely one at that.  His falling for Linney is understandable, and Harris controls his performance brilliantly.SCOTT GLENN &amp; DENNIS HAYSBERT as the secret service men are very different and the contrast works well.  Glenn is remorseful over his actions; Haysbert is obviously a man who likes to kill and feel power.  Their supporting contribution is essential to the movie.E.G. MARSHALL - this late great actor has never been better.  An 80 year old billionaire with a young wife who he really loves faces her tragic death and seeks revenge.  And yet, he had a room built where he could watch this young wife screw around with younger and more virile men just to prove he loved her.  Marshall's scene in the limo with Clint is also very moving.JUDY DAVIS - this talented actress at times reminded me of Cruella Deville with her flashy arm movements and histrionics, but as her character develops, one can see the motivation behind these gestures, and the deep passion she feels for Hackman.A very well done and enthralling movie.",5,THE POWER OF THE DIRECTOR,1075852800,"02 4, 2004",2004,2195,"['MYSTIC', 'RIVER', 'being', 'most', 'recent', 'example', 'director', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'why', 'movies', 'are', 'so', 'powerful', 'casting', 'expert', 'effective', 'direction', 'Eastwood', 'director', 'much', 'better', 'Eastwood', 'actor', 'are', 'times', 'wish', ""'d"", 'cast', 'others', 'roles', 'aside', 'political', 'thriller', 'soars', 'wonderful', 'actors', 'way', 'Clint', 'bring', 'out', 'best', 'even', 'smaller', 'seemingly', 'insignificant', 'scenes', 'Let', 'look', 'performances', 'GENE', 'HACKMAN', 'outstanding', 'actor', 'who', 'always', 'hundred', 'percent', ""n't"", 'get', 'lot', 'screen', 'time', 'one', 'course', 'scenes', 'are', 'pivotal', 'ability', 'create', 'such', 'devious', 'self-centered', 'liar', 'are', 'brilliant.LAURA', 'LINNEY', 'one', 'most', 'consistently', 'good', 'actresses', 'Laura', 'cliche', 'role', 'abandoned', 'daughter', 'hurt', 'love', 'still', 'get', 'out', 'devotion', 'man', 'abandoned', 'scene', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'father', 'apartment', 'pictures', 'wonderful.ED', 'HARRIS', 'smart', 'cop', 'attractive', 'lonely', 'one', 'falling', 'Linney', 'understandable', 'Harris', 'performance', 'brilliantly.SCOTT', 'GLENN', 'amp', 'DENNIS', 'HAYSBERT', 'secret', 'service', 'men', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'contrast', 'well', 'Glenn', 'remorseful', 'actions', 'Haysbert', 'obviously', 'man', 'who', 'kill', 'feel', 'power', 'supporting', 'contribution', 'essential', 'movie.E.G', 'MARSHALL', 'late', 'great', 'actor', 'never', 'been', 'better', '80', 'year', 'old', 'billionaire', 'young', 'wife', 'who', 'really', 'tragic', 'death', 'revenge', 'yet', 'had', 'room', 'built', 'where', 'could', 'watch', 'young', 'wife', 'screw', 'younger', 'more', 'virile', 'men', 'just', 'prove', 'loved', 'Marshall', 'scene', 'limo', 'Clint', 'also', 'very', 'moving.JUDY', 'DAVIS', 'talented', 'actress', 'times', 'reminded', 'Cruella', 'Deville', 'flashy', 'arm', 'movements', 'histrionics', 'character', 'develops', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'motivation', 'gestures', 'deep', 'passion', 'Hackman.A', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'enthralling', 'movie']",N/A

It was entertaining and gripping and I loved every minute of it. I especially loved that I didn't know *anything* about the plot of the movie as I watched it. There were a few extra surprises for me along the way, which enhanced my enjoyment of the movie.I loved Clint Eastwood's character. He's such a wiley and resourceful fellow, definitely able and capable. But he's not above playing the ""age card"", and making mentions of his AARP membership, and trying to pass himself off as someone who is too old to do anything interesting anymore. The twinkle in his eye as he starts in with the age thing is very amusing indeed.The rest of the cast in this film is also very good-special cudos for E.G. Marshall, in one of his last roles. His performance is articulate and strong and spot-on. Ed Harris has that friendly, open face, and he's very likeable in this movie. He's also able to show a sweet sense of humor. (The line, ""I live alone"" will have a special significance after you see this movie!) Gene Hackman is great as a wimpy yet simultaniously slimy character. Judy Davis is absolutely wonderful too-as an evil ice queen hiding behind the mask of an attractive woman. Dennis Haysbert (now playing Palmer in ""24"") and character actor Scott Glenn are good in their roles as well.The best part in this film, in my opinion, are the scenes between Eastwood and his estranged daughter, played by Laura Linney. Their relationship is what makes this movie stand out. Eastwood's character has been seemingly so distant from his daughter for so many years; yet she's  still his ""little girl"" and we see how deeply he loves her as the film progresses.This is a worthwhile film, and very entertaining.

My reviews focus only on the quality of the transfer to blu ray itself.When I first inserted the disc and saw the menu my expectations went into the toilet as the menu was a still photo image with only 'language', ""play, and 'scene selection'.  There are no extras whatsoever.  However, the transfer shows a Mbps average rate of between mid teens and lower 30s so there has to be an improvement over the standard def version somewhere.Video...From the dark opening scenes and throughout the rest of the film  you are presented with a video transfer marked by excessively crushed blacks, far more than I remember the initial release as being.  There really aren't many details in the darker/shadow areas even when the scene is in brighter daylight.  That said, the crushed blacks that appear to go below 0 IRE may have been by design.  The color resolutions are somewhat muted and slightly bleach bypassed but the contrast levels are really quite decent.  There is film grain but no grain that seems intrusive or distracting.  I saw no artifacting at all.  However, and this is a first for me ever seeing this...at 35 minutes into the film, Clint's character runs into his daughter jogging in the park.  There ensues a conversation between them and  the camera is shooting a medium closeup back and forth between both.  If you look at their shoulders and neck you actually see a green haloed outline.  This made me think that perhaps this scene was done in front of a blue or green screen that was poorly chroma keyed.  As an editor, I recognized the green outline and the only time I have ever seen this is when someone does not do a chroma keying job properly.  At no point in any other part of the film did I see this.  I was surprised to see some fisheye lens used in certain scenes that I had never noticed in previous watchings.  The transfer to Blu Ray is not bad, it is just not the best I have seen before.The audio defaults to its DTSMA 5.1 lossless sound and it is the star of the BR.  There was surprisingly good panning across the front stage and discreet channeling as well.

38748,A1PHVLYS6T4YW5,0780631641,T. Berner,"[1, 1]","There is a rule in Hollywood: when a Democrat is in office, movies about the President of the United States should portray decent and honorable men, like Air Force One and The American President. But when a Republican in office, the President should be addle brained and/or evil, like the senile old man who launches a war in Clear and Present Danger.Unfortunately, Absolute Power was released when Bill Clinton was President, so the critics were predisposed to damn it. And that is unfortunate, because it is one of Eastwood's best. If Bob Dole had been elected in 1996, this would have been regarded by The New York Times and The Washington Post's critics as the classic that it is.The plot might be a bit far-fetched, but it is a great parable about the corruption of power and a reminder that truth isn't always on the side of the most powerful. No wonder The New York Times hated it! William Goldman's script is spot on.The cast is A-1. Laura Linney is an attractive woman, but she does not have movie star looks, which makes her perfect as the daughter who discovers she really hadn't been abandoned by her jewel thief father. Judy Davis is terrific as the President's Chief of Staff slowly going crazy. A scene where she is dancing with the President while she discovers that the necklace she is wearing was worn by the murdered woman is a classic.The action scenes are wonderful. A scene where Eastwoodmanages to evade two separate assassins and the Washington police is a great set piece.Of all the excellent aspects of the movie, its humor, its thrilling plot, the very best is the endearing father and daughter relationship between Eastwood and Linney.

He is planning what is suppose to be his last job, and everything is going smoothly until some come in before he can leave. He hides in a secret room and from behind a one-way mirror sees that it's the wife of the owner of the house he is robbing and another man. They are fooling around when the guy decides to liven things up by striking her, she get away but he corners her, she then grabs a letter opener and is about to stab him when he cries out for help when two men come in and shoot her dead. It seems that the man is Alan Richmond, the President of the United States and the two men are the secret service agents assigned to him. Later, a woman, Gloria Russell, who is his Chief of Staff enters and upon learning of what has happened, decides to cover it up and make it appear that she was killed by a burglar. After sanitizing the room, they are about to leave but they forget the letter opener, Whitney comes out of the room and takes it and makes his getaway but when they returned for the letter opener they discover Whitney and chase him but he gets away. The police investigate the murder and there are so many inconsistencies, which makes the investigator, Seth Frank suspect that something is going on. Frank then discovers that Whitney is a possible suspect but the only thing is that he doesn't believe that Whitney is a killer. Whitney tries to leave town but when he learns just how corrupt and amoral Richmond is he decides to play mind games with him and the others. Richmond, at the same time, tells them that Whitney must be silenced permanently. Eastwood's direction is simply outstanding.
