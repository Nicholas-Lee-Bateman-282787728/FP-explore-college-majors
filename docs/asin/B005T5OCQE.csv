1503113,AC1K4OQOZ90RS,B005T5OCQE,"E. Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[24, 25]","Countless books, films, and television programs have described the genocide perpetrated by the Nazis during the Second World War, when millions of men, women, and children were shot, hanged, buried alive, burned to death, starved, experimented upon, and gassed throughout Europe.  We have all seen horrifying footage of emaciated and disease-ridden victims and photographs of smug German soldiers who took part in the Final Solution.  In addition, a great deal has been written about what happened to the Nazis after the war.  Did they pay for their transgressions?Although approximately one thousand Nazi officials were convicted of crimes against humanity during the Nuremberg Trials, hundreds of thousands of perpetrators escaped and went on to live normal lives.  They held jobs, ran businesses, raised families, and in some cases, lived to a ripe old age.  Some are still alive today.  ""Elusive Justice"" is an eye-opening documentary, written and directed by Jonathan Silvers and expertly narrated by Candice Bergen.  Silvers shot footage in eight countries over three years, in which he exposes the shameful truth about the reluctance of the Allies to capture and punish those who committed crimes against humanity.How can this be?  We learn from commentary by historians, Holocaust survivors, attorneys, politicians, and military officials that:  1)  The Allies were more interested in fighting communists than they were in prosecuting Nazis, some of whom had scientific knowledge that Americans needed. 2) Members of the clergy helped Nazis escape to South America with forged American Red Cross passports. 3)  The Argentinean government provided a safe haven to Nazis, who gladly taught the dictators brutal techniques of imprisonment and torture. 4) Some governments preferred to forget about the atrocities, believing that it was too expensive, time consuming, and arduous to locate and prosecute so many fugitives.Silvers focuses on little known individuals who, in desperation, became Nazi hunters.  Asher Ben-Natan, the first Israeli ambassador to Germany, funded a covert operation to identify and apprehend Nazi war criminals.  On the strength of a tip, Silvers tracks down Dr. Heinrich Gross, who presided over the Spiegelgrund clinic in Vienna, where the brains of disabled children had been stored in the basement for decades.  Serge and Beate Klarsfeld exposed Kurt Lischka, a former SS Colonel and Gestapo chief who became a judge in his hometown of Cologne after the war.  Vladas Zajanckauskas, originally from Lithuania, is the oldest person awaiting deportation by the U. S. Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations.  When interviewed, Zajanckauskas protested that he has been stripped of his U. S. citizenship; he wants to die in America and be buried with members of his family.  He will probably get his wish.Why bother pursuing these elderly individuals after so much time has passed?  As Silvers eloquently states, ""The enemies of humanity must be punished--if humanity itself is to survive."" He adds, however, ""How can we ever have justice for crimes on such a scale?"" ""Elusive Justice"" contains hard-hitting archival footage, heartrending testimony from survivors, and thought-provoking facts about how little has been done to punish those who cold-bloodedly carried out such appalling acts of brutality on so many defenseless people.",5,"""You can't have a functioning society with killers at large.""",1322956800,"12 4, 2011",2011,3378,"['Countless', 'books', 'films', 'television', 'programs', 'have', 'described', 'genocide', 'perpetrated', 'Nazis', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'when', 'millions', 'men', 'women', 'children', 'were', 'shot', 'hanged', 'buried', 'alive', 'burned', 'death', 'starved', 'experimented', 'gassed', 'Europe', 'have', 'seen', 'horrifying', 'footage', 'emaciated', 'disease-ridden', 'victims', 'photographs', 'smug', 'German', 'soldiers', 'who', 'took', 'part', 'Final', 'Solution', 'addition', 'great', 'deal', 'been', 'written', 'what', 'happened', 'Nazis', 'war', 'Did', 'pay', 'transgressions', 'approximately', 'one', 'thousand', 'Nazi', 'officials', 'were', 'convicted', 'crimes', 'humanity', 'Nuremberg', 'Trials', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'perpetrators', 'escaped', 'went', 'live', 'normal', 'lives', 'held', 'jobs', 'ran', 'businesses', 'raised', 'families', 'cases', 'lived', 'ripe', 'old', 'age', 'are', 'still', 'alive', 'today', 'Elusive', 'Justice', 'eye-opening', 'documentary', 'written', 'directed', 'Jonathan', 'Silvers', 'expertly', 'narrated', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'Silvers', 'shot', 'footage', 'eight', 'countries', 'three', 'years', 'shameful', 'truth', 'reluctance', 'Allies', 'capture', 'punish', 'who', 'committed', 'crimes', 'humanity.How', 'can', 'be', 'learn', 'commentary', 'historians', 'Holocaust', 'survivors', 'attorneys', 'politicians', 'military', 'officials', '1', 'Allies', 'were', 'more', 'interested', 'fighting', 'communists', 'were', 'prosecuting', 'Nazis', 'whom', 'had', 'scientific', 'knowledge', 'Americans', 'needed', '2', 'Members', 'clergy', 'helped', 'Nazis', 'escape', 'South', 'America', 'forged', 'American', 'Red', 'Cross', 'passports', '3', 'Argentinean', 'government', 'provided', 'safe', 'haven', 'Nazis', 'who', 'gladly', 'taught', 'dictators', 'brutal', 'techniques', 'imprisonment', 'torture', '4', 'governments', 'preferred', 'forget', 'atrocities', 'believing', 'was', 'too', 'expensive', 'time', 'consuming', 'arduous', 'locate', 'prosecute', 'so', 'many', 'fugitives.Silvers', 'focuses', 'little', 'known', 'individuals', 'who', 'desperation', 'became', 'Nazi', 'hunters', 'Asher', 'Ben-Natan', 'first', 'Israeli', 'ambassador', 'Germany', 'funded', 'covert', 'operation', 'identify', 'apprehend', 'Nazi', 'war', 'criminals', 'strength', 'tip', 'Silvers', 'down', 'Dr.', 'Heinrich', 'Gross', 'who', 'presided', 'Spiegelgrund', 'clinic', 'Vienna', 'where', 'brains', 'disabled', 'children', 'had', 'been', 'stored', 'basement', 'decades', 'Serge', 'Beate', 'Klarsfeld', 'exposed', 'Kurt', 'Lischka', 'former', 'SS', 'Colonel', 'Gestapo', 'chief', 'who', 'became', 'judge', 'hometown', 'Cologne', 'war', 'Vladas', 'Zajanckauskas', 'originally', 'Lithuania', 'oldest', 'person', 'awaiting', 'deportation', 'U.', 'S.', 'Justice', 'Department', 'Office', 'Special', 'Investigations', 'When', 'interviewed', 'Zajanckauskas', 'protested', 'been', 'stripped', 'U.', 'S.', 'citizenship', 'die', 'America', 'be', 'buried', 'members', 'family', 'will', 'probably', 'get', 'wish.Why', 'bother', 'pursuing', 'elderly', 'individuals', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'passed', 'Silvers', 'eloquently', 'enemies', 'humanity', 'must', 'be', 'punished', 'humanity', 'survive', 'however', 'How', 'can', 'ever', 'have', 'justice', 'crimes', 'scale', 'Elusive', 'Justice', 'hard-hitting', 'archival', 'footage', 'heartrending', 'testimony', 'survivors', 'thought-provoking', 'facts', 'how', 'little', 'been', 'done', 'punish', 'who', 'cold-bloodedly', 'carried', 'out', 'such', 'appalling', 'acts', 'brutality', 'so', 'many', 'defenseless', 'people']",Elusive Justice: The Search for Nazi War Criminals
