987557,AVJZQ6YNFUK92,B000FBQRIS,Grindhouse and Horror,"[1, 1]","As mentioned in the commentary, this 80s trash movie was filmed on broadcast video. While some 80s horror flicks will appeal to a large audience, this isn't one of them. Although it's bizarre and somewhat unique in parts, it will bore many. The story involves a guy with strong psychic powers, a cursed boarding house, and a never fully seen insane mental patient (or maybe he's possessed by the boarding house ghost,or he is actually the ghost wearing black gloves) who has bizarre psychic powers and has escaped from an institution. This never fully seen maniac or demon basically makes weird breathing noises and motions with his hands to unleash these powers to kill. Some of the stuff he does is make the intestines of one guy fall out through his shirt, makes another girl bleed, and another woman's eyes bulge and fall out. The haunted house is causing problems as well, with stuff like a bloody shower hallucination and other stuff. There's a decent body count, and the film has good looking women with plenty of nudity; there's some flashes of full frontal. One thing that I thought really stands out is the electronic sounding music which is excellent; the film is so cheap, but it has got a very well done main score. The ending of the film showcases a psychic fight between the good guy and the boarding house ghost, and it's particularly cheesy and funny with atrocious acting; this is a memorable scene of bad filmmaking. The problem with the flick is that it has some boring filler scenes in between the nudity and violence, but I still really like it because it's a memorable piece of cheese and bad cinema.The DVD quality is pretty good considering it's such a cheap video movie from the 80s, but I'm a little disappointed. It would've been more enjoyable with better quality. The commentary is good and there's the excellent main soundtrack playing during the menu screen.",4,80s video trash that's not for everyone,1372896000,"07 4, 2013",2013,1890,"['mentioned', 'commentary', '80s', 'trash', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'broadcast', 'video', '80s', 'horror', 'flicks', 'will', 'appeal', 'large', 'audience', ""n't"", 'one', 'bizarre', 'somewhat', 'unique', 'parts', 'will', 'bore', 'many', 'story', 'guy', 'strong', 'psychic', 'powers', 'cursed', 'boarding', 'house', 'never', 'fully', 'seen', 'insane', 'mental', 'patient', 'maybe', 'possessed', 'boarding', 'house', 'ghost', 'actually', 'ghost', 'wearing', 'black', 'gloves', 'who', 'bizarre', 'psychic', 'powers', 'escaped', 'institution', 'never', 'fully', 'seen', 'maniac', 'demon', 'basically', 'weird', 'breathing', 'noises', 'motions', 'hands', 'unleash', 'powers', 'kill', 'stuff', 'make', 'intestines', 'one', 'guy', 'fall', 'out', 'shirt', 'girl', 'bleed', 'woman', 'eyes', 'bulge', 'fall', 'out', 'haunted', 'house', 'causing', 'problems', 'as', 'well', 'stuff', 'bloody', 'shower', 'hallucination', 'other', 'stuff', 'decent', 'body', 'count', 'film', 'good', 'looking', 'women', 'plenty', 'nudity', 'flashes', 'full', 'frontal', 'One', 'thing', 'thought', 'really', 'out', 'electronic', 'sounding', 'music', 'excellent', 'film', 'so', 'cheap', 'got', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'main', 'score', 'ending', 'film', 'psychic', 'fight', 'good', 'guy', 'boarding', 'house', 'ghost', 'particularly', 'cheesy', 'funny', 'atrocious', 'acting', 'memorable', 'scene', 'bad', 'filmmaking', 'problem', 'flick', 'boring', 'filler', 'scenes', 'nudity', 'violence', 'still', 'really', 'memorable', 'piece', 'cheese', 'bad', 'cinema.The', 'DVD', 'quality', 'pretty', 'good', 'considering', 'such', 'cheap', 'video', 'movie', '80s', ""'m"", 'little', 'disappointed', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'better', 'quality', 'commentary', 'good', 'excellent', 'main', 'soundtrack', 'playing', 'menu', 'screen']",N/A

I remember seeing some, gloved, maniac getting ready to drill a hole in some woman's head. I went to the video store on the corner, looking for this video. Unfortunately they didn't have it, and I rented ""Halloween III"" instead. Ironically enough, ""Halloween III) also has a drill kill scene.Almost 30 years later here I am watching ""Boarding House"" and my lord what a schlock fest this film is. Cheesy, horrendous acting, atrocious dialogue but so much fun to watch. It really looks like a few people just got together, got really hammered and said ""Let's make a horror film"".Honestly, the plot was pretty hard for me to figure out. I don't know if I wanted to figure it out. This is one you have to see to believe. Not only because of how cheesy, and unique it is, but also because of how bad it is. I have never seen a film like this, and I've been watching horror films for 30 years.Interesting, fun, boring, weird, and ridiculous would be a few adjectives to descrive this ""film"".

While at first glance it seems to be nothing more than a cheap piece of schlock shot in someone's backyard, what makes BOARDINGHOUSE stand out amid the hordes of other such movies is the movie's undeniably off-the-wall atmosphere, demented performances and amusingly ameteurish make-up and visual effects.

987560,A1URL5GTZY0E9W,B000FBQRIS,Lemmy Caution,"[4, 4]","I recommend this film to anyone who wants to laugh until their stomach muscles ache.  I first saw it, about 10 years ago, at a screening at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, presented by Bill Landis, author of Sleazoid Express, an excellent book on exploitation cinema.  ""Modern Art"" aptly describes this shot-on-video time capsule of awful early-1980s clothing, hairstyles, computer graphics, and extremely cheesy music and pathetic ""special effects"".  The end result?A masterpiece of horror that defies description.  Throw in the most ridiculous script, dialogue and acting outside of an Ed Wood or H.G. Lewis film -- and you're in for a wild ride!  We were falling out of our seats at the SF MOMA, shaking with uncontrollable laughter, and dumbstruck with awe that Boardinghouse was ever made, that it actually existed in the same universe as our own.A recent (shaky) on-camera interview with director Wintergate and star Kalassu is interesting chiefly for their attempt to convince us that the film was meant to be a spoof -- and that their efforts at parody were overruled by the producer, who apparently believe Boardinghouse would work better as a serious horror movie!  I'm not sure what to believe.The transfer quality is about what you'd expect -- high-def digital video cameras didn't exist in 1982 -- and the filmmakers claim this was shot in ""broadcast-quality"" video, then transferred to 35mm celluloid for theatrical projection.  Huh.  Most of it still manages to look as if they used consumer-grade equipment typical of the time.  This disc was apparently transferred off the original video source material, so it's certainly watchable (as well as laughable).Don't take my word for it: rent or buy this movie, and you will realize that your life could never be complete until you've seen Boardinghouse -- and stay with it right until the mind-melting, soul-shattering, bloodcurdling finale: FOCUS!
