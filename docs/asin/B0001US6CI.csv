813192,A36IYF4FWA8MD8,B0001US6CI,an amazon fan,"[2, 6]","I did not know much about Reagan except his attempted assassination, his wife consulting astrologers to help in makingdecisions for the country, Starwar's, his memory problems, Iranian bits and pieces, and the Bitburg incident. The movie filled in some of my gaps so it was a history lesson to some extent, but to me, the movie seemed shallow and forced. As for a review I saw which said how how dare they sour the name of one of the geatest presidents we ever had for instance with the Bitburg incident, all I could say is I'm sorry.This movie was made using public accounts as stated at the beginning, and it is totally true that Reagan said what the reviewer used not as a criticism of Reagan, but as a reason toportray this president as perfect, and the movie producers as rot. How low can this reviewer go and how low did Reagan go as well to say that the Nazi killers buried at Bitburg were surely as much victims as those in the concentration camps! This reviewer is absolutely ignorant or a twistering idiot. The fact is that Reagan did say the above regarding Bitburg Nazi's and by saying this, Reagan has diminished his moral stature to say the least.

813193,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B0001US6CI,Anyechka,"[2, 3]","I'm just about as politically opposite Ronald Reagan as they come, but I really enjoyed this three-hour biopic.  James Brolin is a dead ringer for Reagan in every single way, so much so it's kind of scary.  Judy Davis also does a very good job at playing Nancy Reagan.  Usually one shouldn't expect too much from a made-for-tv movie, but this is one of the ones that got it really right.  There were a great script, great acting from everyone, and good production values.  As James Brolin says in the short interview included as an extra, since doing this movie, he's had a number of people come up to him to say that they never thought much of Reagan till they saw this movie, and that his portrayal of Reagan changed that.  I'm still far from a fan of his presidency, but after seeing this movie, I now view Reagan the person (as opposed to the politician) in a better light.This biopic doesn't always go extraordinarily deep (such as, for example, not really explaining just why so many California students hated Governor Reagan so much), and it does leave out some events that would be considered pretty important (such as the Challenger disaster), but the events that are there are pretty comprehensive and well-connected.  In spite of some gaps and omissions, this story flows very well and is very compelling.  The excellent audio commentary provides even more insight into the people and events, and explains further some of the things that weren't addressed very deeply.  I fail to see how in the world this biopic could be considered a hatchet job or an attack on the Reagans.  It seemed very fair and balanced to me, and even was a lot kinder to his presidency than it could have been.  It shows Reagan as a genuinely nice, affable, personable guy, someone who was never an A-list actor but who was always a great leader and speaker, someone who had charisma and personality.  The biopic portrays him as going into politics and switching parties only very reluctantly, and often seeming to be a better husband than father.  The black spots in his career as a politician (such as creating a huge homeless problem, voodoo economics, ignoring the AIDS crisis, the Bitburg fiasco, Iran-Contra) are similarly dealt with, but not to the extent that these negative things overwhelm the entire story.  It was downright scary to find out in the audio commentary that all of the people raising such a fuss over this movie and wanting to have it banned (even trying to get Reagan put onto the dime to make up for it!) had never even seen it.  They couldn't have, since no one had seen the movie yet.  They were basing their opinions on a very early script, and apparently didn't realise that practically every movie goes through multiple scripts.  And it's no secret that a lot of Republicans view Reagan as a demigod, thus feeling that anyone or anything that doesn't treat him with similar kid gloves is viewed as a liar, unpatriotic, or what have you.  And the scariest thing of all was that most people didn't even protest the people who were protesting against this movie and demanding it be censored, even though they had no authority to have any opinion on it, positive or negative, when it had never even been aired yet.All in all, this is a pretty positive view of Ronald and Nancy Reagan.  The producers easily could have made it more sensational and negative, but they didn't.  They actually toned down the accounts of abuse (at the hands of Nancy) that Patti Reagan wrote about in her book, and cut out scenes that had raised a lot of the protest, re Reagan's policy (or, more accurately, lack of a policy) on dealing with the AIDS crisis.  It even gives him credit for being one of the people who helped to end the Cold War, and also covers a number of his other positive achievements as a politician.  I don't even like Reagan as a politician, and I came away from this biopic feeling very positive towards him as a person, and even slightly less negative towards him as a politician.  I'd recommend it to anyone with an open mind who wants to learn more about the Reagan family.",5,A fascinating biopic,1148688000,"05 27, 2006",2006,4093,"[""'m"", 'just', 'about', 'politically', 'opposite', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'come', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'three-hour', 'biopic', 'James', 'Brolin', 'dead', 'ringer', 'Reagan', 'single', 'way', 'so', 'much', 'kind', 'scary', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'Nancy', 'Reagan', 'Usually', 'one', 'should', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'made-for-tv', 'movie', 'one', 'ones', 'got', 'really', 'right', 'were', 'great', 'script', 'great', 'acting', 'everyone', 'good', 'production', 'values', 'James', 'Brolin', 'short', 'interview', 'included', 'extra', 'doing', 'movie', 'had', 'number', 'people', 'come', 'up', 'say', 'never', 'thought', 'much', 'Reagan', 'saw', 'movie', 'portrayal', 'Reagan', 'changed', ""'m"", 'still', 'far', 'fan', 'presidency', 'seeing', 'movie', 'now', 'view', 'Reagan', 'person', 'opposed', 'politician', 'better', 'light.This', 'biopic', ""n't"", 'always', 'go', 'extraordinarily', 'deep', 'such', 'example', 'not', 'really', 'explaining', 'just', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'California', 'students', 'hated', 'Governor', 'Reagan', 'so', 'much', 'leave', 'out', 'events', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'pretty', 'important', 'such', 'Challenger', 'disaster', 'events', 'are', 'are', 'pretty', 'comprehensive', 'well-connected', 'spite', 'gaps', 'omissions', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'very', 'compelling', 'excellent', 'audio', 'commentary', 'even', 'more', 'insight', 'people', 'events', 'further', 'things', 'were', ""n't"", 'addressed', 'very', 'deeply', 'fail', 'see', 'how', 'world', 'biopic', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'hatchet', 'job', 'attack', 'Reagans', 'seemed', 'very', 'fair', 'balanced', 'even', 'was', 'lot', 'kinder', 'presidency', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Reagan', 'genuinely', 'nice', 'affable', 'personable', 'guy', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'never', 'A-list', 'actor', 'who', 'was', 'always', 'great', 'leader', 'speaker', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'charisma', 'personality', 'biopic', 'going', 'politics', 'switching', 'parties', 'only', 'very', 'reluctantly', 'often', 'seeming', 'be', 'better', 'husband', 'father', 'black', 'spots', 'career', 'politician', 'such', 'creating', 'huge', 'homeless', 'problem', 'voodoo', 'economics', 'ignoring', 'AIDS', 'crisis', 'Bitburg', 'fiasco', 'Iran-Contra', 'are', 'similarly', 'dealt', 'not', 'extent', 'negative', 'things', 'overwhelm', 'entire', 'story', 'was', 'downright', 'scary', 'find', 'out', 'audio', 'commentary', 'people', 'raising', 'such', 'fuss', 'movie', 'wanting', 'have', 'banned', 'even', 'trying', 'get', 'Reagan', 'put', 'dime', 'make', 'up', 'had', 'never', 'even', 'seen', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'had', 'seen', 'movie', 'yet', 'were', 'basing', 'opinions', 'very', 'early', 'script', 'apparently', 'did', ""n't"", 'realise', 'practically', 'movie', 'multiple', 'scripts', 'secret', 'lot', 'Republicans', 'view', 'Reagan', 'demigod', 'thus', 'feeling', 'anyone', 'anything', ""n't"", 'treat', 'similar', 'kid', 'gloves', 'viewed', 'liar', 'unpatriotic', 'what', 'have', 'scariest', 'thing', 'was', 'most', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'protest', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'protesting', 'movie', 'demanding', 'be', 'censored', 'even', 'had', 'authority', 'have', 'opinion', 'positive', 'negative', 'when', 'had', 'never', 'even', 'been', 'aired', 'yet.All', 'pretty', 'positive', 'view', 'Ronald', 'Nancy', 'Reagan', 'producers', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'sensational', 'negative', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'toned', 'down', 'accounts', 'abuse', 'hands', 'Nancy', 'Patti', 'Reagan', 'wrote', 'book', 'cut', 'out', 'scenes', 'had', 'raised', 'lot', 'protest', 're', 'Reagan', 'policy', 'more', 'accurately', 'lack', 'policy', 'dealing', 'AIDS', 'crisis', 'even', 'credit', 'being', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'helped', 'end', 'Cold', 'War', 'also', 'number', 'other', 'positive', 'achievements', 'politician', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'like', 'Reagan', 'politician', 'came', 'away', 'biopic', 'feeling', 'very', 'positive', 'towards', 'person', 'even', 'slightly', 'less', 'negative', 'towards', 'politician', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'open', 'mind', 'who', 'learn', 'more', 'Reagan', 'family']",N/A

I caught this on Showtime a few months back & have been awaiting the infamous ""cut"" scenes. Judy Davis rocks as Nancy Reagan!!! I was only a child during the Reagan years and it appears as though Ms. Davis nails the coldhearted, social climbing Nancy Pants to a tee. The Gipper is hilarious. All his gaffes are covered (ketchup is a vegetable, trees cause pollution, Bitburg memorial) including the infamous Iran/Contra scandal. We also get the assassination attempt by Bush family friend and Jodie Foster stalker, Hinckley. Though the other Showtime film (Day Reagan Was Shot) goes more indepth.  While Judy Davis is the acting goddess in this film, a special salute goes to the actress portraying Reagan badgirl, Patti Davis. She comes off very sympathetic and damaged growing up in a family that chooses power and money over love.

813196,A3QOPWF1LQCR6L,B0001US6CI,"C. Einhorn ""henryeinhorn""","[9, 30]","This movie doesn't deserve anything but a big fat F. Whoever made it probably never, ever picked up a history book in his life. Not only is it incorrect, it has almost no resemblance what so ever, to President Reagan and his admistration. The dress up is great, sure, Brolin looks exacly like Ronald Reagan, but that's about it.How dare someone portray such a great President like this, it's an utter disgrace. Let me give you an example: When Reagan was going to Bittberg Cemetery in Germany, it was discovered that there where some SS Officers burried there. ""The guys that gave us Auschwitz"" - as someone tells Mike Deaver in the movie. When Reagan is asked why he's going despite this, he replies: ""Those young officers under those Nazi uniforms, are victims of Nazi'ism, just like the victims of the Concentration Camps were!"" Unbelievable! Outrageous! How dare someone say, that President Reagan would say such a stupid, senseless thing. It is the greatest injustice someone can do such a great President.Now about the inaccuracies of the movie. If you pay just a little bit of attention, you can see, how little the producers bothered doing their research. One tiny example: In the movie we see Deaver telling Oliver North, that Ramadan is a Muslim Holiday when you fast 30 days. Well, check your facts Mister, you fast 40 days on Ramadan not 30. Another example: In the movie we see, Reagan speaking directly to Gorbachev in English. Gorbachev didn't understand a word of English, they always spoke via interpreter. The whole Iran-Contra scandal is so twisted up, it's not even funny. Which again proves, how little those prducers bothered checking their facts, and how little they understand politics. Also, at one point, the movie leads us to believe that Reagan was already suffering from Alzheimer's in '85, which is ridiculous and totally untrue.What ever happened to the Cold War? What about the infamous ""Mr. Gorbachev tear down this wall"" speach? What about the ""Evil Empire"" speech? There's hardly anything about the Cold War. Wasn't winning the cold war the President's greatest achievment?The little there is in the movie about the Cold War, makes it sound like the cold war was won in one day. We have Shultz runing in to the President: ""Mr. President, Gorbachev blinked, you ended the Cold War!"". What is this some kind of joke? Any one who knows a little bit about Reagan and the Cold War, knows that it took so much negotiating, and there were so many setbacks, until Reagan finally got gorbachev to sign an arms agreement deal, and besides, the Berlin Wall only came down a year after Reagan left office.The younger generation that didn't know Reagan, will watch this movie, and be led to believe that this is what Reagan was all about. I think it's a crime. They took a great leader and humiliated him.I also think they owe a huge apology to the reagan family, particulary to Nancy, for portraying her as a mean mother who didn't care about her children, and to every one else in the administration they so falsly portrayed.",1,A Disgrace and A Shame,1104364800,"12 30, 2004",2004,3049,"['movie', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'anything', 'big', 'fat', 'F.', 'Whoever', 'made', 'probably', 'never', 'ever', 'picked', 'up', 'history', 'book', 'life', 'Not', 'only', 'incorrect', 'almost', 'resemblance', 'what', 'so', 'ever', 'President', 'Reagan', 'admistration', 'dress', 'up', 'great', 'sure', 'Brolin', 'exacly', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'it.How', 'dare', 'someone', 'portray', 'such', 'great', 'President', 'utter', 'disgrace', 'Let', 'give', 'example', 'When', 'Reagan', 'was', 'going', 'Bittberg', 'Cemetery', 'Germany', 'was', 'discovered', 'where', 'SS', 'Officers', 'burried', 'there', 'guys', 'gave', 'Auschwitz', 'someone', 'Mike', 'Deaver', 'movie', 'When', 'Reagan', 'asked', 'why', 'going', 'young', 'officers', 'Nazi', 'uniforms', 'are', 'victims', ""Nazi'ism"", 'just', 'victims', 'Concentration', 'Camps', 'were', 'Unbelievable', 'Outrageous', 'How', 'dare', 'someone', 'say', 'President', 'Reagan', 'would', 'say', 'such', 'stupid', 'senseless', 'thing', 'greatest', 'injustice', 'someone', 'can', 'do', 'such', 'great', 'President.Now', 'inaccuracies', 'movie', 'pay', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'attention', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'little', 'producers', 'bothered', 'doing', 'research', 'One', 'tiny', 'example', 'movie', 'see', 'Deaver', 'telling', 'Oliver', 'North', 'Ramadan', 'Muslim', 'Holiday', 'when', 'fast', '30', 'days', 'Well', 'check', 'facts', 'Mister', 'fast', '40', 'days', 'Ramadan', 'not', '30', 'example', 'movie', 'see', 'Reagan', 'speaking', 'directly', 'Gorbachev', 'English', 'Gorbachev', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'word', 'English', 'always', 'spoke', 'interpreter', 'whole', 'Iran-Contra', 'scandal', 'so', 'twisted', 'up', 'not', 'even', 'funny', 'Which', 'again', 'how', 'little', 'prducers', 'bothered', 'checking', 'facts', 'how', 'little', 'understand', 'politics', 'Also', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'believe', 'Reagan', 'was', 'already', 'suffering', 'Alzheimer', ""'85"", 'ridiculous', 'totally', 'untrue.What', 'ever', 'happened', 'Cold', 'War', 'What', 'infamous', 'Mr.', 'Gorbachev', 'tear', 'down', 'wall', 'speach', 'What', 'Evil', 'Empire', 'speech', 'hardly', 'anything', 'Cold', 'War', 'Was', ""n't"", 'winning', 'cold', 'war', 'President', 'greatest', 'achievment', 'little', 'movie', 'Cold', 'War', 'cold', 'war', 'was', 'won', 'one', 'day', 'have', 'Shultz', 'runing', 'President', 'Mr.', 'President', 'Gorbachev', 'blinked', 'ended', 'Cold', 'War', 'What', 'kind', 'joke', 'one', 'who', 'little', 'bit', 'Reagan', 'Cold', 'War', 'took', 'so', 'much', 'negotiating', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'setbacks', 'Reagan', 'finally', 'got', 'gorbachev', 'sign', 'arms', 'agreement', 'deal', 'besides', 'Berlin', 'Wall', 'only', 'came', 'down', 'year', 'Reagan', 'left', 'office.The', 'younger', 'generation', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Reagan', 'will', 'watch', 'movie', 'be', 'led', 'believe', 'what', 'Reagan', 'was', 'think', 'crime', 'took', 'great', 'leader', 'humiliated', 'him.I', 'also', 'think', 'owe', 'huge', 'apology', 'reagan', 'family', 'particulary', 'Nancy', 'portraying', 'mean', 'mother', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'children', 'one', 'else', 'administration', 'so', 'falsly', 'portrayed']",N/A

I did not think he would be convincing at first, but within a few minutes into the film, it was like watching the real Reagan!Unfortunately, there is some fire beneath the controversial smoke this movie generated.  Judy Davis gives a competent performance, as written, but she is no Nancy Reagan.  Her portrayal was too brassy, more of a ""Mommie Dearest"" and there was clearly a lack of sympathy toward her by the writers.  Davis is not convincing at all, especially beside Brolin who practically WAS Ronnie.  I think the film would have done well to consult with the actual people involved before going into production.My very first presidential vote went for Reagan in 1984.  As a gay man I am among few who can say that with pride.  He made a lot of mistakes during his presidency, but not one with any mean-spiritedness.  His underlings took care of that part of the administration.  For all the liberal extremists who constantly bashed Reagan, calling him a war-monger and ideologue, just look at what's happening now.  He actually kept us out of war.  Reagan was misled and ill-served by many influential people working under him.  He was a naive and trusting man, to a fault.This film did a good job of portraying what Ronald Reagan was all about, until it got to the issue of AIDS.  I see why the family protested.  Come on, even Patti, who always bashed her father's policies, resented this film's slant on the AIDS issue.  The fact is that Ronald Reagan was an old man, born of another era, who did not know how to address matters of sexuality.  AIDS automatically implied sexuality.  Reagan was also a surprisingly shy man.  His silence was often the simple result of not knowing what to say.  I once wrote him a strongly critical letter on the matter of his handling of the AIDS crisis.  I now know better.  Yes, he was slow to respond.  But the deaths that followed would have happened anyway.  There is still no cure.  Sometimes we American's are just too accustomed to ""instant gratification"".The film illustrated quite well how Reagan came to be so pro-corporate in his policies.  He had been bought out without even knowing it, thinking the big corporations treated everyone as well as they treated him.  He never thought anyone could behave in a manner less honorable than his own, except for communists.  The fact of the matter is that Ronald Reagan was probably one of the most decent, principled and honorable men ever to hold the office of President.  He could eventually even accept responsibility for his mistakes when he recognized them.  How long has it been since we've seen a president do that?I would love to see another movie about Reagan done with more accuracy and balance, and with James Brolin in the lead role.",3,Engrossing but Misses the Mark,1148860800,"05 29, 2006",2006,2808,"['James', 'Brolin', 'incredible', 'portrayal', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'convincing', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'was', 'watching', 'real', 'Reagan', 'Unfortunately', 'fire', 'controversial', 'smoke', 'movie', 'generated', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'competent', 'performance', 'written', 'Nancy', 'Reagan', 'portrayal', 'was', 'too', 'brassy', 'more', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'was', 'clearly', 'lack', 'sympathy', 'writers', 'Davis', 'not', 'convincing', 'especially', 'beside', 'Brolin', 'who', 'practically', 'WAS', 'Ronnie', 'think', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'well', 'consult', 'actual', 'people', 'involved', 'going', 'production.My', 'very', 'first', 'presidential', 'vote', 'went', 'Reagan', '1984', 'gay', 'man', 'am', 'few', 'who', 'can', 'say', 'pride', 'made', 'lot', 'mistakes', 'presidency', 'not', 'one', 'mean-spiritedness', 'underlings', 'took', 'care', 'part', 'administration', 'liberal', 'extremists', 'who', 'constantly', 'bashed', 'Reagan', 'calling', 'war-monger', 'ideologue', 'just', 'look', 'what', 'happening', 'now', 'actually', 'kept', 'war', 'Reagan', 'was', 'misled', 'ill-served', 'many', 'influential', 'people', 'working', 'was', 'naive', 'trusting', 'man', 'fault.This', 'film', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'what', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'was', 'got', 'issue', 'AIDS', 'see', 'why', 'family', 'protested', 'Come', 'even', 'Patti', 'who', 'always', 'bashed', 'father', 'policies', 'resented', 'film', 'slant', 'AIDS', 'issue', 'fact', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'was', 'old', 'man', 'born', 'era', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'address', 'matters', 'sexuality', 'AIDS', 'automatically', 'implied', 'sexuality', 'Reagan', 'was', 'also', 'surprisingly', 'shy', 'man', 'silence', 'was', 'often', 'simple', 'result', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'say', 'once', 'wrote', 'strongly', 'critical', 'letter', 'matter', 'handling', 'AIDS', 'crisis', 'now', 'know', 'better', 'Yes', 'was', 'slow', 'respond', 'deaths', 'followed', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'anyway', 'still', 'cure', 'Sometimes', 'American', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'accustomed', 'instant', 'gratification', '.The', 'film', 'illustrated', 'quite', 'well', 'how', 'Reagan', 'came', 'be', 'so', 'pro-corporate', 'policies', 'had', 'been', 'bought', 'out', 'even', 'knowing', 'thinking', 'big', 'corporations', 'treated', 'everyone', 'as', 'well', 'treated', 'never', 'thought', 'anyone', 'could', 'behave', 'manner', 'less', 'honorable', 'own', 'communists', 'fact', 'matter', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'decent', 'principled', 'honorable', 'men', 'ever', 'hold', 'office', 'President', 'could', 'eventually', 'even', 'accept', 'responsibility', 'mistakes', 'when', 'recognized', 'How', 'long', 'been', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'president', 'do', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'movie', 'Reagan', 'done', 'more', 'accuracy', 'balance', 'James', 'Brolin', 'lead', 'role']",N/A

Definitely not being a fan of Ronald Reagan the actor, Ronald Reagan the US President, Nancy Davis the actress or Nancy Reagan the US First Lady, I had no idea what to expect of this film. I began viewing it with an open mind for the quality of the performances, directing, history, sound and digital picture. All of those crucial technical aspects of the film are refined and splendid.As far as the history, it's fascinating in as much as any of it is true-enough. I was somewhat surprised that the focus of the film is more on Nancy Reagan than it is on Ronald Reagan and that pleases me. Judy Davis' performance is one of her outstanding best. I wound up liking Judy Davis' Nancy Reagan. I could easily see Judy Davis playing Nancy Davis Reagan.James Brolin's Ronald Reagan is quite a remarkable incarnation. It's difficult to see James Brolin through his personification of Ronald Reagan. From voice, to facial expressions, to stature and most especially to his very particular walk, James Brolin nails his character through performance skill as an actor. I wound up not liking Ronald Reagan in the least, most especially as US President. He's easier to stomach as an actor before becoming US President.Brolin's presentation of Reagan as an emotionally wounded people-pleaser makes it somewhat easier to understand why Reagan was so ease to dupe into his political party's corrupt policies and his executive branch cabinet's cooperation with bigotry and discrimination of minority-statused groups and a host of other unethical types of conduct unbecoming to the office of the US President.I did become more well able to empathize with Ronald Reagan the emotionally wounded man and for that reason found this film to be helpful towards understanding his questionable lack of executive branch leadership while his cabinet engaged in international wrong doing.Reagan's cronistic &#34;trickle-down&#34; (lack) of economics that over-serve the fewest and most wealthy American's while under-serving and downright neglecting every other American is very well conveyed. Reagan really believed his economic policy and practices would eventually strengthen the entire American populous; however, to date, in 2014, with more than 20 years of &#34;Reaganomics&#34; having been enacted, 96% of the American people are still waiting for one penny of a trickle of economic empowerment by the rich to the rest of us.From a now historical perspective, that economic fact is not kind to Reagan's legacy because his policy, no matter which President enacted it, crippled to US economy, to date. This films helps to recognize this.

813199,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B0001US6CI,James Hiller,"[8, 10]","Much of the hype of this television movie lies in the fact that CBS refused to air it, apparently bowing to conservative pressure. This of course created a bunch of hype prior to the release of the movie, and its quick demotion to a DVD release. After watching it, it made me wonder what all of the fuss was about. The Reagans is a comprehensive, yet inch deep look at a powerful couple destined to greatness in the political world.James Brolin plays an eerie, and I mean eerie, Ronald Reagan throughout his lifetime. His acting is spot on in portraying a Reagan who is both wonderfully amiable to everyone that he meets, and yet distant to everyone who loved him the most. This Reagan is an actor through and through, and he continues his performance during his White House years. Judy Davis turns in an admirable performance as a hyper-supportive, controlling Nancy Reagan. I couldn't help but still see shades of Judy Garland in her performance here.Nancy and Ronnie struggle with many issues not uncommon today: the politics of blended families, the politics within a relationship. The movie dares to suggest that Reagan and Nancy weren't perfect demi-Gods that the conservative portion of our population elevate him to be. Perhaps it's too daring to show this man, this couple, as human, foibles and all, and perhaps, that is the nature of the controversy.Overall, very little was surprising about this movie, other than showing the onset of Reagan's Alzheimer's disease into his second term, which long has been suspected. It certainly wasn't the tell all bashing of the Reagans as some would like us to believe.

There is rarely a driving narrative to real people's people's lives. So you watch something like THE REAGANS fascinated by the detail (especially in its portrayal of the Reagan children trying to cope with their closed-off parents), but there's nothing to really be learned from the whole narrative. The Reagans meet and get married, have children; Ronnie runs for governor and then for the presidency four times (twice successfully); he gets shot in office and nearly undone by Iran/Contra, and then they go back to California. That's it.This miniseries was based on a book about the First Ladies of the US, so Nancy of course figures heavily into it. Judy Davis, inarguably one of the greatest actors living today, would seem born to play the ironwilled Nancy, and she approaches her part with a great deal of intelligence and makes Nancy seem enormously sympathetic even at her most imperious to her husband's staff or at her most firebreating to her children. She even gets to do a musical number, with great panache (Nancy's famous rendition of &quot;Second-Hand Rose&quot; for the Gridiron club), and she is allowed one exceptionally poignant scene (her meeting with her senile mother at a retirement home in the mid 80s). James Brolin fares less well: he looks very much like Reagan, and has the mannerisms and the voice down pat (he's even as good a mimic as President Reagan reportedly was), but he does not project the needed vitality. The Reagan children are well portrayed--lonely and needy Michael, upbeat Maureen, angry Patti (Zoie Palmer, in a particularly fine and furious small performance) and practical Ron Jr.--,but you feel they often get shunted off from the main narrative just as they apparently did in real life from their parents' all-consuming love relationship and political ambition.

L LaRegina ""Jim LaRegina""","[0, 2]","Look up the 1981-89 approval ratings of the Reagan presidency as well as public reaction to his regressive tax increases, progressive tax cuts, and other policies at the time and you'll agree America's fortieth president does not belong atop the ""Greatest Presidents"" polls taken today.  But then, this 2003 two-part television drama is titled THE REAGANS, not THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION, its strengths in its portrayal of Ronald Reagan's family life, weaknesses in trying to cover his days as California governor and U.S. president.  Sure, scenes on matters such as the Iran-Contra scandal belong if they relate to how the home life of Reagan, second wife Nancy, and his children were affected.  But any time THE REAGANS takes too long to cut back to Ronald Reagan's relationship with his two daughters and two sons, it goes off track.Did the filmmakers intend for THE REAGANS to be twice its length, which would be the minimum amount of time necessary to depict both the Ronald & Nancy Reagan story and Ronald Reagan's political career?  I'd like to know.  If nothing else, it's a laugh to realize while it includes scenes with political strategist John Sears, secretary of state Alexander Haig, and attorney general Ed Meese, THE REAGANS conspicuously omits screen time for vice president George Bush, as if to underscore how the DOONESBURY comic strip always portrays Poppy Bush as invisible.Anchored by James Brolin's command performance as Ronald Reagan, THE REAGANS gets most interesting when it takes us out of their public life and inside the dysfunctional private home of Ron and Nancy Reagan.  Ronald Reagan, the grandfatherly president of the United States, does not even see his grandchildren.  Ron and Nancy have a tenuous relationship with the daughter that was the reason for their shotgun wedding, Patti, whose fictional book HOME FRONT, about the family of a right-wing kook California governor and his spoiled wife, does not seem to be based on someone else's home.  At times all of Ronald Reagan's children may as well be political opponents for the amount of consideration Ron and Nancy show them but their passages in THE REAGANS are too few.While James Brolin's uncanny take on Ronald Reagan makes for a viewing with no dull moments, THE REAGANS presents too much of a man who was not much of a president and too little of one who was not much of a family man.",3,Worth seeing for James Brolin's performance,1350950400,"10 23, 2012",2012,2382,"['Look', 'up', '1981-89', 'approval', 'ratings', 'Reagan', 'presidency', 'as', 'well', 'public', 'reaction', 'regressive', 'tax', 'increases', 'progressive', 'tax', 'cuts', 'other', 'policies', 'time', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'America', 'fortieth', 'president', 'not', 'belong', 'atop', 'Greatest', 'Presidents', 'polls', 'taken', 'today', 'then', '2003', 'two-part', 'television', 'drama', 'titled', 'THE', 'REAGANS', 'not', 'THE', 'REAGAN', 'ADMINISTRATION', 'strengths', 'portrayal', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'family', 'life', 'trying', 'cover', 'days', 'California', 'governor', 'U.S.', 'president', 'Sure', 'scenes', 'matters', 'such', 'Iran-Contra', 'scandal', 'belong', 'relate', 'how', 'home', 'life', 'Reagan', 'second', 'wife', 'Nancy', 'children', 'were', 'affected', 'time', 'THE', 'REAGANS', 'too', 'long', 'cut', 'back', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'relationship', 'two', 'daughters', 'two', 'sons', 'off', 'track.Did', 'filmmakers', 'intend', 'THE', 'REAGANS', 'be', 'twice', 'length', 'would', 'be', 'minimum', 'amount', 'time', 'necessary', 'depict', 'Ronald', 'Nancy', 'Reagan', 'story', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'political', 'career', ""'d"", 'like', 'know', 'nothing', 'else', 'laugh', 'realize', 'scenes', 'political', 'strategist', 'John', 'Sears', 'secretary', 'state', 'Alexander', 'Haig', 'attorney', 'general', 'Ed', 'Meese', 'THE', 'REAGANS', 'conspicuously', 'screen', 'time', 'vice', 'president', 'George', 'Bush', 'underscore', 'how', 'DOONESBURY', 'comic', 'strip', 'always', 'Poppy', 'Bush', 'invisible.Anchored', 'James', 'Brolin', 'command', 'performance', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'THE', 'REAGANS', 'most', 'interesting', 'when', 'public', 'life', 'dysfunctional', 'private', 'home', 'Ron', 'Nancy', 'Reagan', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'grandfatherly', 'president', 'United', 'States', 'not', 'even', 'see', 'grandchildren', 'Ron', 'Nancy', 'have', 'tenuous', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'was', 'reason', 'shotgun', 'wedding', 'Patti', 'fictional', 'book', 'HOME', 'FRONT', 'family', 'right-wing', 'kook', 'California', 'governor', 'spoiled', 'wife', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'based', 'someone', 'else', 'home', 'times', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'children', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'political', 'opponents', 'amount', 'consideration', 'Ron', 'Nancy', 'show', 'passages', 'REAGANS', 'are', 'too', 'few.While', 'James', 'Brolin', 'uncanny', 'take', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'viewing', 'dull', 'moments', 'REAGANS', 'presents', 'too', 'much', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'president', 'too', 'little', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'family', 'man']",N/A
813205,A2T049UQONS0OY,B0001US6CI,Larry VanDeSande,"[5, 7]","I liked this flick better than most made for TV movies but understand why Reagan conservatives were upset with it. For nothing about it supports the idea the Ronnie should be placed on Mt. Rushmore, an idea that was once given consideration inside the U.S. Congress. Fortunately, that was an idea that went the way of the dodo bird.This movie was like a lot of biopics -- it skimmed over portions of the subject that had been discussed in other media. When showing Reagan's strongarm tactics with California college protestors while he served as governor of California in the 1960s, the viewer was given no insight into what made him the epitome of evil to college kids in that time. After all, Country Joe and Fish referred to him as ""Ronald Ray-Gun Zap"" at Woodstock!Other vignettes -- including Nancy's ""Just say no"" campaign and her discussion with the president over funding AIDS prevention -- were equally superficial. Occasionally, however, a scene showed the heart of these two actors turned politicians turned power brokers.In one scene, Ed Meese calls the president at 4:40 AM to tell him American fighter jets just shot down a couple Libyan jets that fired on them. ""It happened five hours ago,"" Meese said. ""It is handled."" When returning to sleep, Nancy asked him what the call was. ""Oh nothing,"" he said. ""Ed handled it."" That's followed by a scene of Nancy lecturing Meese and Mike Deaver on how they are to say the president is always aware of such events five minutes after they occur.Other scenes of interaction between Reagan, Nancy, their two birth children and Reagan's children from his first marriage showed an uncanny insight into family dysfunction. These were probably the most hated scenes for those that wanted to cast the former president in stone in South Dakota.Reagan lovers will be pleased to learn there aren't any scenes of him falling asleep at meeting! And while the flick focuses on Reagan's superficiality as both statesman and father, it also shows him to be a loving person and gives him kudos for ending the Cold War. In this respect it reminded me of the ESPN production about Indiana basketball coach Bobby Knight, ""Season On The Brink"", that portrayed both his best and worst sides as a human being.The plum of this film, however, is Judy Davis's performance as Nancy Reagan. While impossible to say if it was completely factual, it was certainly spiritually correct. This wonderful actress did a splendid job portraying the imperial ""Quenn Nancy"" wife of the governor and president, as well as her important role as person behind the power in the White House.While James Brolin did a good job mimicking Reagan it is clearly Davis's portrayal that makes this film compelling and worth watching. Personally, I found the aura projected in the film to be accurate, as well. It played out the highlights of his presidency -- from the earliest budget-cutting and Evil Empire stomping to his eventual conflict with Iran-Contra -- as well as can be done in a few hours.

813206,A1H3ZATBDMOJ6Z,B0001US6CI,Louis Barbarelli,"[1, 2]","This was a lot more balanced than I expected it would be, particularly with regard to Nancy Reagan.  As portrayed by Judy Davis, she comes across as a tough but intelligent First Lady whose judgement and political instincts are sharper than her husband's.  If anything, the Nancy Reagan of this movie is a toned down version of the real one.  Except for the makeup.  Judy Davis, a beautiful woman, is slathered in garish lipstick that makes her look like Faye Dunaway playing Joan Crawford playing a hooker.  I can't figure out why her makeup is so outlandish while Brolin's makeup, which must have been much more of a challenge for the makeup artists, is so good.Brolin does look like Reagan, right down to the turkey neck, and he even sounds like him.  But, while his performance isn't really bad, he lacks Reagan's natural charm and charisma.  When Brolin-as-Reagan makes a speech to a group of people, his delivery is so ho-hum, we can't relate to the rapt expressions of the people listening to him.  This is fatal to the film.Virtually no character in the movie comes off completely untarnished except for Michael Deaver.  Inexplicably, Gorbachev is portrayed as overwrought and animated, two characteristics I don't associate with him.  John Stamos, an underrated actor overshadowed in recent years by his beautiful wife, is convincingly smooth and slimey as John Sears, Reagan's campaign manager.  Alander Haig and Donald Regan are played as jerks, which may not be inaccurate.One of the things that makes the movie look somewhat biased is that it portrays Reagan as more bumbling and disconnected than he probably was.  It also suggests that Reagan's poor memory, in recalling the facts about Iran/Contra, and even in making the decisions that led up to that scandal, was due to incipient Alzheimer's.  I don't think there are any facts to support this notion.Although, the title &quot;The Reagans&quot; suggests that this will be mainly about Reagan's family life, that topic is secondary while politics and the key historical events of Reagan's presidency are the principal focus.A better script could have made this effort more noteworthy than it turned out to be.  But, in fairness to the scipt writers and the filmmakers, I think it's important to note that this movie is at times unflattering and, at other times, overly generous to the Reagans; it does NOT boil down to a hatchet job.",3,Somewhat Unflattering but Not a Trashing,1087516800,"06 18, 2004",2004,2400,"['was', 'lot', 'more', 'balanced', 'expected', 'would', 'be', 'particularly', 'regard', 'Nancy', 'Reagan', 'portrayed', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'across', 'tough', 'intelligent', 'First', 'Lady', 'judgement', 'political', 'instincts', 'are', 'sharper', 'husband', 'anything', 'Nancy', 'Reagan', 'movie', 'toned', 'down', 'version', 'real', 'one', 'makeup', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'slathered', 'garish', 'lipstick', 'look', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'playing', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'playing', 'hooker', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'makeup', 'so', 'outlandish', 'Brolin', 'makeup', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'challenge', 'makeup', 'artists', 'so', 'good.Brolin', 'look', 'Reagan', 'right', 'down', 'turkey', 'neck', 'even', 'performance', ""n't"", 'really', 'bad', 'Reagan', 'natural', 'charm', 'charisma', 'When', 'Brolin-as-Reagan', 'speech', 'group', 'people', 'delivery', 'so', 'ho-hum', 'ca', ""n't"", 'relate', 'rapt', 'expressions', 'people', 'listening', 'fatal', 'film.Virtually', 'character', 'movie', 'off', 'completely', 'untarnished', 'Michael', 'Deaver', 'Inexplicably', 'Gorbachev', 'portrayed', 'overwrought', 'animated', 'two', 'characteristics', 'do', ""n't"", 'associate', 'John', 'Stamos', 'underrated', 'actor', 'overshadowed', 'recent', 'years', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'convincingly', 'smooth', 'slimey', 'John', 'Sears', 'Reagan', 'campaign', 'manager', 'Alander', 'Haig', 'Donald', 'Regan', 'are', 'played', 'jerks', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'inaccurate.One', 'things', 'movie', 'look', 'somewhat', 'biased', 'Reagan', 'more', 'bumbling', 'disconnected', 'probably', 'was', 'also', 'Reagan', 'poor', 'memory', 'recalling', 'facts', 'Iran/Contra', 'even', 'making', 'decisions', 'led', 'up', 'scandal', 'was', 'due', 'incipient', 'Alzheimer', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'are', 'facts', 'support', 'notion.Although', 'title', 'quot', 'Reagans', 'quot', 'will', 'be', 'mainly', 'Reagan', 'family', 'life', 'topic', 'secondary', 'politics', 'key', 'historical', 'events', 'Reagan', 'presidency', 'are', 'principal', 'focus.A', 'better', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'effort', 'more', 'noteworthy', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'fairness', 'scipt', 'writers', 'filmmakers', 'think', 'important', 'note', 'movie', 'times', 'unflattering', 'other', 'times', 'overly', 'generous', 'Reagans', 'NOT', 'boil', 'down', 'hatchet', 'job']",N/A
813207,ABE8YHLYSM15G,B0001US6CI,Luke Killion,"[1, 1]","""The Reagans"" is decent effort to show the rise and presidency of Ronald Reagan. The film starts in the post WWII era, which shows the affable Reagan as as an FDR Democrat who presides over the Screen Actors Guild.  From this perspective, the reader sees that Reagan began as an actor and his subsequent path is not so much a movie role as a change with the times. Many people who were not in on the ""Reagan Revolution"" saw him as front man or figurehead, rather than a real innovative leader. This film shows his reluctance to break with the Democrats (as Hollywood was and is very liberal), yet cites the killing of Kennedy as the turning point in Reagan's life to begin a new direction, as he is sort of propped up (his shift of allegience is rather sudden) as a candidate for California Governor after becoming familiar with Barry Goldwater during the 1964 election. His stance as a bulwark against the California counter culture of the late 1960's is covered rather briefly, but this film shows that as a man, he and Nancy were impacted the same way as many other baby boomer parents.The political career of the man is also balanced with his personal life, which is an important component to any presidential biopic.  I'm not exactly sure on the true relationships he had with his children, but this film portrays them as being very turbulent, with Patty as an unstable and rebellious pot head and Ronald Jr. as a slightly effeminate ballet dancer with questionable sexuality. Reagan seems very typical of the greatest generation in this regard; his baby boomer kids are ""exhibitionist"" and free spirited.The acting in this movie was probably its best aspect, with the Ron and Nancy team of James Brolin and Judy Davis showing alot about the dynamics of their professional teamwork. James Brolin is a dead ringer for Reagan, both in his appearence and mannerisms, as Judy Davis shows the personality change that can accompany rising to the top, as many took to calling her ""Queen Nancy."" While this film is generally even handed, not leaning too hard in one political direction or the other, I found that the Iran Contra scandal plays prominently in creating an intro as well as a conclusion, as Reagan is afraid of ending up like Nixon while Nancy and the White House attempt to conceal his early onset alzheimer's, which the film frames as the cause of some of the bad decision making during his second term.  But Reagan was certainly no Nixon, and the likeable and reasonable man come across in Brolin's preformance.",3,"Passable 3 hr made for TV movie, covering 4 decades",1341014400,"06 30, 2012",2012,2524,"['Reagans', 'decent', 'effort', 'show', 'rise', 'presidency', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'film', 'post', 'WWII', 'era', 'affable', 'Reagan', 'FDR', 'Democrat', 'who', 'Screen', 'Actors', 'Guild', 'perspective', 'reader', 'Reagan', 'began', 'actor', 'subsequent', 'path', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'role', 'change', 'times', 'Many', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'Reagan', 'Revolution', 'saw', 'front', 'man', 'figurehead', 'rather', 'real', 'innovative', 'leader', 'film', 'reluctance', 'break', 'Democrats', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'very', 'liberal', 'yet', 'killing', 'Kennedy', 'turning', 'point', 'Reagan', 'life', 'begin', 'new', 'direction', 'sort', 'propped', 'up', 'shift', 'allegience', 'rather', 'sudden', 'candidate', 'California', 'Governor', 'becoming', 'familiar', 'Barry', 'Goldwater', '1964', 'election', 'stance', 'bulwark', 'California', 'counter', 'culture', 'late', '1960', 'covered', 'rather', 'briefly', 'film', 'man', 'Nancy', 'were', 'impacted', 'same', 'way', 'many', 'other', 'baby', 'boomer', 'parents.The', 'political', 'career', 'man', 'also', 'balanced', 'personal', 'life', 'important', 'component', 'presidential', 'biopic', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'true', 'relationships', 'had', 'children', 'film', 'being', 'very', 'turbulent', 'Patty', 'unstable', 'rebellious', 'pot', 'head', 'Ronald', 'Jr.', 'slightly', 'effeminate', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'questionable', 'sexuality', 'Reagan', 'very', 'typical', 'greatest', 'generation', 'regard', 'baby', 'boomer', 'kids', 'are', 'exhibitionist', 'free', 'spirited.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'aspect', 'Ron', 'Nancy', 'team', 'James', 'Brolin', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'showing', 'alot', 'dynamics', 'professional', 'teamwork', 'James', 'Brolin', 'dead', 'ringer', 'Reagan', 'appearence', 'mannerisms', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'personality', 'change', 'can', 'accompany', 'rising', 'top', 'many', 'took', 'calling', 'Queen', 'Nancy', 'film', 'generally', 'even', 'handed', 'not', 'leaning', 'too', 'hard', 'one', 'political', 'direction', 'other', 'found', 'Iran', 'Contra', 'scandal', 'prominently', 'creating', 'intro', 'as', 'well', 'conclusion', 'Reagan', 'afraid', 'ending', 'up', 'Nixon', 'Nancy', 'White', 'House', 'attempt', 'conceal', 'early', 'onset', 'alzheimer', 'film', 'frames', 'cause', 'bad', 'decision', 'making', 'second', 'term', 'Reagan', 'was', 'certainly', 'no', 'Nixon', 'likeable', 'reasonable', 'man', 'come', 'Brolin', 'preformance']",N/A

Being a liberal who didn't think much of the Reagans, I expected to see an unfavorable portrayal of the Reagans...but as I watched it, I felt impressed by Ronald Reagan, if he was actually the way James Brolin brilliantly captures him (voice, presence, walk).  He comes across as a likeable, funny person who is not much for the details and appears to be mishandled by his cutthroat staff members.  James Brolin and Judy Davis deserve Emmy wins for their portrayal of the first couple.  Its touching to see how much they obviously love each other through the trials of a public life, even if their relationship to each other came at the expense of their children.  I own a few Kennedy movies, and don't recall any attempts at boycotting/censoring those, even if they portrayed JFK's infidelity and health problems.  This movie about the Reagans shouldn't surprise anyone who has read the autobiographies/memoirs by Ronald, Nancy, and Patti Davis.  This film gave me a renewed appreciation for Reagan as a person and president.  Conservatives should take note...if this film was a liberal slam against the former president, then it wouldn't have changed the mind of this liberal regarding him as a person.  I still may not like most of his policies, but its hard to fault a funny, decent man that Reagan was.

If one were to take any single still frame out of the film it would look like Reagan.  If you listened to the voice, it would sound like Reagan.  However, Brolin lacked the life and expressions of the real Ronald Reagan.  The real Reagan captivated audiences.  Brolin seems flat and empty.The film is limited in time and cannot cover all the facts, but at times issues were raised without fully addressing them.  For instance, the film raised the issue of Reagan saying he had seen the holocaust while his advisors note that Reagan never left the US during the war.  They don't tell you that Reagan saw some of the first pictures of holocaust victims because of his role in making films for the war.Over all, it was an interesting film, but the flat emptiness in Brolin's presentation of Reagan was a big disappointment.",3,James Brolin in a Reagan Mask,1089072000,"07 6, 2004",2004,959,"['film', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'expected', 'reviews', 'James', 'Brolin', 'looked', 'was', 'wearing', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'smiling', 'mask', 'one', 'were', 'take', 'single', 'still', 'film', 'would', 'look', 'Reagan', 'listened', 'voice', 'would', 'sound', 'Reagan', 'However', 'Brolin', 'lacked', 'life', 'expressions', 'real', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'real', 'Reagan', 'captivated', 'audiences', 'Brolin', 'flat', 'empty.The', 'film', 'limited', 'time', 'can', 'not', 'cover', 'facts', 'times', 'issues', 'were', 'raised', 'fully', 'addressing', 'instance', 'film', 'raised', 'issue', 'Reagan', 'saying', 'had', 'seen', 'holocaust', 'advisors', 'note', 'Reagan', 'never', 'left', 'US', 'war', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Reagan', 'saw', 'first', 'pictures', 'holocaust', 'victims', 'role', 'making', 'films', 'war.Over', 'was', 'interesting', 'film', 'flat', 'emptiness', 'Brolin', 'presentation', 'Reagan', 'was', 'big', 'disappointment']",N/A
813213,A303U1MOXG5R1F,B0001US6CI,Sylviastel,"[0, 0]","The three hour movie depicting the courtship and marriage of Ronald Reagan and Nancy Davis is quite an event. James Brolin is superb in this role and Judy Davis who has played Judy Garland immerses into the Nancy Reagan role. Other cast members like Zeljo Ivanek who played Mike Deaver and Bill Smitrovich who played Alexander Haig all admirable jobs in their roles. But the film belongs to the couple, Ron and Nancy.While watching this film and his rise in politics and his entertainment background, you feel sympathy towards the late President who was a Democrat before being a Republican. I still think Ronald Reagan deserved to be honored by his former acting community. After he left the White House, accolades like Stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, honorary Oscars, and other honors should have been bestowed upon both Nancy and Ron just out of courtesy, respect and honor. At least, they should have been honored in my opinion.Regardless of how you feel about the Reagans, this film humanizes Ron and Nancy as people, parents, spouses, friends, allies, and partners in life. Nancy was vilified in the media for years. But this film shows how they endured, survived, and thrived in two difficult worlds--Hollywood and Washington DC. Too bad the film ends when they leave office, the film doesn't have Jane Wyman (Ron's first wife) at all in the film. The relationship between the parents and children had been turbulent and tumultous particularly with Patty Davis, Ron and Nancy's oldest.Their younger son, Ron Reagan Jr. was a professional dancer and was stereotyped as gay. I don't think if he has, they would have had a problem with Ron. Ron and Doria have just celebrated their 30th anniversary. I loved the scene in which they parodied Tom Cruise's dancing scene in Risky Business on Saturday Night Live when Ron hosted.I thought the relationship with Ron Jr. and Patty and their parents was odd when they learned about their adopted brother, Michael, and sister Maureen from their father's first marriage. When Michael flunks out of school, he expects his father to react harshly but Ron Sr. doesn't. He is welcomed at their home regardless of his grades. His father states ""grades don't matter"" or something to that effect.Although I felt that AIDS was made aware in the movie, I don't recall seeing Reagan make a speech to that effect. Nancy's war on drugs was her crusade in the White House. But I believe the Reagans lost a lot more to the AIDS crisis as well including friends from the entertainment community. I never believed that they didn't have compassion or awareness. There are times when Ron is praying to save the lives. The movie doesn't forget that he saved 77 lives as a lifeguard for 7 summers. I think he was doing the same in politics and Hollywood as a Screen Actors Guild President. Still, I think this film would be greatly used in schools as a teaching toolI do wish that the DVD featured more footage or including an interview with Judy Davis about her take on the role of Nancy Reagan. Ron and Nancy Reagan's marriage was truly filled with love that they didn't really need anybody else but each other. They have a kind of love that lasts forever into eternity. They really were the best of partners, friends, spouses, and lovers. Too bad, we don't have couples like them anymore.",4,The DVD Could Have Added Much More!,1310860800,"07 17, 2011",2011,3321,"['three', 'hour', 'movie', 'depicting', 'courtship', 'marriage', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'Nancy', 'Davis', 'quite', 'event', 'James', 'Brolin', 'superb', 'role', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'who', 'played', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'Nancy', 'Reagan', 'role', 'Other', 'cast', 'members', 'Zeljo', 'Ivanek', 'who', 'played', 'Mike', 'Deaver', 'Bill', 'Smitrovich', 'who', 'played', 'Alexander', 'Haig', 'admirable', 'jobs', 'roles', 'film', 'belongs', 'couple', 'Ron', 'Nancy.While', 'watching', 'film', 'rise', 'politics', 'entertainment', 'background', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'late', 'President', 'who', 'was', 'Democrat', 'being', 'Republican', 'still', 'think', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'deserved', 'be', 'honored', 'former', 'acting', 'community', 'left', 'White', 'House', 'Stars', 'Hollywood', 'Walk', 'Fame', 'honorary', 'Oscars', 'other', 'honors', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'bestowed', 'Nancy', 'Ron', 'just', 'courtesy', 'respect', 'honor', 'least', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'honored', 'opinion.Regardless', 'how', 'feel', 'Reagans', 'film', 'Ron', 'Nancy', 'people', 'parents', 'spouses', 'friends', 'allies', 'partners', 'life', 'Nancy', 'was', 'vilified', 'media', 'years', 'film', 'how', 'endured', 'survived', 'thrived', 'two', 'difficult', 'worlds', 'Hollywood', 'Washington', 'DC', 'Too', 'bad', 'film', 'when', 'leave', 'office', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'Jane', 'Wyman', 'Ron', 'first', 'wife', 'film', 'relationship', 'parents', 'children', 'had', 'been', 'turbulent', 'tumultous', 'particularly', 'Patty', 'Davis', 'Ron', 'Nancy', 'oldest.Their', 'younger', 'son', 'Ron', 'Reagan', 'Jr.', 'was', 'professional', 'dancer', 'was', 'stereotyped', 'gay', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'problem', 'Ron', 'Ron', 'Doria', 'have', 'just', 'celebrated', '30th', 'anniversary', 'loved', 'scene', 'parodied', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'dancing', 'scene', 'Risky', 'Business', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'when', 'Ron', 'hosted.I', 'thought', 'relationship', 'Ron', 'Jr.', 'Patty', 'parents', 'was', 'odd', 'when', 'learned', 'adopted', 'brother', 'Michael', 'sister', 'Maureen', 'father', 'first', 'marriage', 'When', 'Michael', 'school', 'father', 'react', 'harshly', 'Ron', 'Sr.', ""n't"", 'welcomed', 'home', 'regardless', 'grades', 'father', 'grades', 'do', ""n't"", 'matter', 'something', 'effect.Although', 'felt', 'AIDS', 'was', 'made', 'aware', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'seeing', 'Reagan', 'make', 'speech', 'effect', 'Nancy', 'war', 'drugs', 'was', 'crusade', 'White', 'House', 'believe', 'Reagans', 'lost', 'lot', 'more', 'AIDS', 'crisis', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'friends', 'entertainment', 'community', 'never', 'believed', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'compassion', 'awareness', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'Ron', 'praying', 'save', 'lives', 'movie', ""n't"", 'forget', 'saved', '77', 'lives', 'lifeguard', '7', 'summers', 'think', 'was', 'doing', 'same', 'politics', 'Hollywood', 'Screen', 'Actors', 'Guild', 'President', 'Still', 'think', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'greatly', 'used', 'schools', 'teaching', 'toolI', 'do', 'wish', 'DVD', 'featured', 'more', 'footage', 'including', 'interview', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'take', 'role', 'Nancy', 'Reagan', 'Ron', 'Nancy', 'Reagan', 'marriage', 'was', 'truly', 'filled', 'love', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'anybody', 'else', 'other', 'have', 'kind', 'love', 'forever', 'eternity', 'really', 'were', 'best', 'partners', 'friends', 'spouses', 'lovers', 'Too', 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'couples', 'anymore']",N/A
