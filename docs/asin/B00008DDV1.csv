738991,A19UTUEBWKIZFT,B00008DDV1,AKN,"[1, 1]","Ram Dass was a favorite of many in the 1970's and beyond, someone who could describe ""being here now"" as a path to enlightenment.  His book Be Here Now sold almost as many books as The Bible and Dr. Spock.  Clearly his mission was to help, through spiritual wisdom and enlightenment, as many people as possible to attain the blissful state of enlightenment he himself felt he had attained, therefore escaping from further earthly suffering.I have read all his books and in a few places I remember feeling an ego state he had, something not compatible with being the spiritual being he clearly is.For instance in one place he describes in a sentence or two how once people like himself attain a certain level of spiritual developement suffering isn't needed and these people live blissful lives free of suffering and enjoy nothing but pure joy and contentment.He now feels that his stroke, or ""being stroked"" as he calls it, was an act of grace, to teach him a further lesson he needed to learn.  He says ""We all have our melodramas.They can be very sticky.""  He has come to terms with his condition of near paralysis.He describes how on one side we all have suffering, and on the other side we all have grace, so we have to balance these out.  By grace he means he can get through it as he has a lot of help, and ends by saying where he is now is ok.The amazing life of this man, his obvious genius, the revelation that there was more to life than money and success as a Harvard professor once he tried LSD with Timothy Leary, is a fascinating story.  There were many moments where his talks and counseling with people who were troubled brought tears to my eyes as I saw how good he was at saying just the right things to get people to see their suffering in a new light.  But it had to happen to him, too.  He says when he was brought to the hospital there was no spiritual thoughts or feelings.  He was just miserably lying there staring up at the ceiling unable to move.He candidly says, ""I failed the test.""The stroke forced him to admit he still has some work to do on himself.  The grace comes from knowing he is loved and cared for, still in a good place.There is God, Guru, and you.  And they are all the same being.  As Ram Dass says, life grinds you up.  I found it incredibly inspiring and moving seeing this amazing man coping with his life's lessons.",5,"I wept, love this guy",1329609600,"02 19, 2012",2012,2363,"['Ram', 'Dass', 'was', 'favorite', 'many', '1970', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'describe', 'being', 'here', 'now', 'path', 'enlightenment', 'book', 'Be', 'Here', 'Now', 'sold', 'almost', 'many', 'books', 'Bible', 'Dr.', 'Spock', 'Clearly', 'mission', 'was', 'help', 'spiritual', 'wisdom', 'enlightenment', 'many', 'people', 'possible', 'attain', 'blissful', 'state', 'enlightenment', 'felt', 'had', 'attained', 'therefore', 'escaping', 'further', 'earthly', 'suffering.I', 'have', 'read', 'books', 'few', 'places', 'remember', 'feeling', 'ego', 'state', 'had', 'something', 'not', 'compatible', 'being', 'spiritual', 'being', 'clearly', 'is.For', 'instance', 'one', 'place', 'sentence', 'two', 'how', 'once', 'people', 'attain', 'certain', 'level', 'spiritual', 'developement', 'suffering', ""n't"", 'needed', 'people', 'live', 'blissful', 'lives', 'free', 'suffering', 'enjoy', 'nothing', 'pure', 'joy', 'contentment.He', 'now', 'stroke', 'being', 'stroked', 'was', 'act', 'grace', 'teach', 'further', 'lesson', 'needed', 'learn', 'have', 'melodramas.They', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'sticky', 'come', 'terms', 'condition', 'near', 'paralysis.He', 'how', 'one', 'side', 'have', 'suffering', 'other', 'side', 'have', 'grace', 'have', 'balance', 'grace', 'can', 'get', 'lot', 'help', 'ends', 'saying', 'where', 'now', 'ok.The', 'amazing', 'life', 'man', 'obvious', 'genius', 'revelation', 'was', 'more', 'life', 'money', 'success', 'Harvard', 'professor', 'once', 'tried', 'LSD', 'Timothy', 'Leary', 'fascinating', 'story', 'were', 'many', 'moments', 'where', 'talks', 'counseling', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'troubled', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes', 'saw', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'saying', 'just', 'right', 'things', 'get', 'people', 'see', 'suffering', 'new', 'light', 'had', 'happen', 'too', 'when', 'was', 'brought', 'hospital', 'was', 'spiritual', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'was', 'just', 'miserably', 'lying', 'there', 'staring', 'up', 'ceiling', 'unable', 'move.He', 'candidly', 'failed', 'test', 'stroke', 'forced', 'admit', 'still', 'work', 'do', 'grace', 'knowing', 'loved', 'cared', 'still', 'good', 'place.There', 'God', 'Guru', 'are', 'same', 'being', 'Ram', 'Dass', 'life', 'grinds', 'found', 'incredibly', 'inspiring', 'moving', 'seeing', 'amazing', 'man', 'coping', 'life', 'lessons']",Ram Dass: Fierce Grace

The film is a study of the would-be prophet after his stroke, and shows his struggle with language and aging as it makes illusions to his earlier life. It showcases the way in which he continues to inspire and be admired by thousands. We see him interact in with therapists and give speaking engagements. Numerous interviews are held with those who know him. I must note that, even though I don't give a darn for its subject, the movie is very well-crafted.However, I can only give it a tepid recommendation because there is no critical evaluation of Ram Dass-or at least a person interviewed who does not think he's great. This is needed as, contrary to unconventional wisdom, Dass is not a profound man. His observations, then and now, were a stringing together of banal clich&eacute;s involving words like ""love, consciousness"" and ""spirituality."" If you're the type of person who regards taking acid as ""a religious experience"" then you'll be receptive to a guy like this. For those who have had enough of sixties emotionalism, you might not want to see the hailing of this vapid fellow for ninety minutes, but that's what Fierce Grace amounts to. Dass finds nobility in most of the things he does and with the film he hopes to show baby boomers what age has in store for them, but that spoiled generation may be the only one in history who regard death as not being absolutely necessary or that maybe it doesn't apply to them.

I discovered his books and tapes just about the time I decided to change my college major from Anthropology to Religious Studies. It's books like: 'Be Here Now', 'The Only Dance There Is' and more recently 'Still Here' that continue to break through my rigidity of thought and open my mind and heart to new vistas of understanding and acceptance.I had the priviledge of meeting Ram Dass back in '76 after a talk he gave at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, CA. During that brief moment in his presence I experienced an unmistakable flow of energy emanating from this ex-Harvard professor, turned subversive LSD user, turned Hindi guru and devotee of Hanuman, the Monkey-God. I felt totally alive, empowered and so bursting with emotion that I didn't get a wink of sleep that night.Through the years I've met, or stood in the presence of numerous famous spiritual figures from a wide variety of faiths and traditions and I can honestly say that I've never experienced anything comparable to what enveloped me that night in '76 as I looked into the smiling, grandfatherly face of Ram Dass.Seeing Ram Dass old, infirmed and confined to a wheelchair since his stroke in '97 takes a little getting used to, but once you gaze deeply into those mischevous eyes and see that knowing smile you realize he hasn't changed a bit. At least not concerning the things that really matter. 'Fierce Grace' is a magnificent visual document presenting one mans' commitment to love, endurance and living life ""in the moment."" His teachings and attitude have remained as clear and consistent today as they were thirty-five years ago; humorous, insightful, deeply personal and above all compassionate.RAM...........................................................",5,Still Here And Dancing The Only Dance There Is!,1128643200,"10 7, 2005",2005,1835,"['Baba', 'Ram', 'Dass', 'was', 'one', 'major', 'spiritual', 'influences', 'life', 'early', ""'70"", 'discovered', 'books', 'tapes', 'just', 'time', 'decided', 'change', 'college', 'major', 'Anthropology', 'Religious', 'Studies', 'books', ""'Be"", 'Here', 'Now', 'Only', 'Dance', 'Is', 'more', 'recently', ""'Still"", 'Here', ""'"", 'continue', 'break', 'rigidity', 'thought', 'open', 'mind', 'heart', 'new', 'vistas', 'understanding', 'acceptance.I', 'had', 'priviledge', 'meeting', 'Ram', 'Dass', 'back', ""'76"", 'talk', 'gave', 'Shrine', 'Auditorium', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'CA', 'brief', 'moment', 'presence', 'experienced', 'unmistakable', 'flow', 'energy', 'emanating', 'ex-Harvard', 'professor', 'turned', 'subversive', 'LSD', 'user', 'turned', 'Hindi', 'guru', 'devotee', 'Hanuman', 'Monkey-God', 'felt', 'totally', 'alive', 'empowered', 'so', 'bursting', 'emotion', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'wink', 'sleep', 'years', ""'ve"", 'met', 'stood', 'presence', 'numerous', 'famous', 'spiritual', 'figures', 'wide', 'variety', 'faiths', 'traditions', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', ""'ve"", 'never', 'experienced', 'anything', 'comparable', 'what', 'enveloped', 'night', 'looked', 'smiling', 'grandfatherly', 'face', 'Ram', 'Dass.Seeing', 'Ram', 'Dass', 'old', 'infirmed', 'confined', 'wheelchair', 'stroke', ""'97"", 'little', 'getting', 'used', 'once', 'gaze', 'deeply', 'mischevous', 'eyes', 'see', 'knowing', 'smile', 'realize', ""n't"", 'changed', 'bit', 'least', 'not', 'concerning', 'things', 'really', 'matter', ""'Fierce"", 'Grace', 'magnificent', 'visual', 'document', 'presenting', 'one', 'mans', 'commitment', 'love', 'endurance', 'living', 'life', 'moment', 'teachings', 'attitude', 'have', 'remained', 'clear', 'consistent', 'today', 'were', 'thirty-five', 'years', 'ago', 'humorous', 'insightful', 'deeply', 'personal', 'compassionate.RAM', '..']",Ram Dass: Fierce Grace
738996,A3TXY9E0HDWMXK,B00008DDV1,Howard Schumann,"[86, 87]","Mickey Lemle's documentary Ram Dass, Fierce Grace, describes the life of Ram Dass (Richard Alpert), author, 60s guru, spiritual teacher, cohort of Timothy Leary, and author of Be Here Now, one of the most influential books of the 1970s. The film begins in the present as Ram Dass deals with the effects of a massive stroke he suffered in February 1997 that left him physically incapacitated and with impaired memory and speech.Interweaving current conversations, interviews with people in his life, and archival footage, Lemle then looks back at his childhood, the controversy surrounding his research with Timothy Leary in psychedelics at Harvard, his studies in India with Neem Karoli Baba who renamed him Baba Ram Dass (Servant of God), his work with the Seva Foundation in social action projects dedicated to relieving suffering in the world, and his impact as an author and guru to millions of followers. Several examples are shown of his compassion and his ability to feel the pain of others. In an opening sequence, his beautiful ""Rachel's Letter""*comforts a family after their daughter was murdered. In the final sequence, Ram Dass listens to a young woman struggling to overcome her grief at her boyfriend's violent death. In a powerfully moving segment, she brings Ram Dass to tears when she tells him about a dream she had in which her boyfriend speaks to her from beyond with a reassuring message.When Ram Dass received the ""fierce grace"" of being ""stroked"", he admits he did not have any unusual spiritual epiphany. He recalls, ""Here I am, Mr. Spiritual, and in my own head I didn't orient toward the spirit. It showed me I have some work to do"". He has written about the stroke in his latest book, ""Still Here"" in which he talks about slowing down, and finding out about the ""everything"" that is out there. For Ram Dass, aging has become a gift. ""I was galumphing through life before the stroke"", he says. ""I'm at peace now more than I've ever been. The peace comes from settling in to the moment"". Enhanced by the music of Krishna Das, the documentary is more than just a bio-pic or a meditation on the process of aging, it is an inspiring portrait of a man whose life can be summed up in one word -- service. Ram Dass has said, ""What one person has to offer to another is their own being, nothing more, nothing less"". In Ram Dass, Fierce Grace, Mr. Lemle has given us Ram Dass' being, nothing more, nothing less.

Morgan ""Light Coach""","[16, 17]","I don't know if it was just me or what, but when I was fifteen, I thought I was somehow going to be the one that magically escaped ""old age"". But then I got to be in my twenties and I still clung to a shred of hope that maybe I could still escape it. After my thirties I knew I was going to be no different than all the others that preceeded me, age was inevitable, but getting old was entirely up to me.In this exceptional movie, Ram Dass shows us that even though the body may betray us, the Spirit that is within is always willing to make all things new. He is a ""true"" Spiritual teacher. He lives what he talks about. I was always kind of suspect of those ""teachers"" who claimed to be so exalted and beyond this world. What makes a ""true"" spiritual teacher is someone who shows us the we are in the world, but we are not of it...that our limitations are not here to thwart us, but are given to us so that we may get the opportunity to prove that our soul/our spirit is infinitely stronger than any situation we may be going through.I have to admit, I've done my fair share of pouting the last few years. My body has had its share of trials and tribulations to overcome and after seeing Fierce Grace, I was actually embarrassed about my physical complaining. Ram Dass has faced his physical limitations with an even greater willingness to ""serve God"". He truly is the embodiment of Love, Compassion, and Service.We can all learn from this beautiful movie. Do we curse the things that we are given or do we realize that even the so called difficulties that are in our lives are blessings? We really don't know what is for our Highest Good, but there is something that does and it is that something greater that we need to continually surrender to moment by moment by precious moment.Every moment of our lives has gotten us to right here and right now and where we will eventually end up will be determined by what we predominantly used our time for. Did we use our time helping others or by seeing what we could get from others? Did we use our time for celebrating or for mourning our losses? Did we realize the amount of grace that is available in each and every moment or did we argue that life isn't fair? We may not be able to escape age, but we can use it to our greatest advantage.This movie is a blessing.

738998,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00008DDV1,Linda Linguvic,"[109, 117]","This is a documentary about the legendary Harvard professor, Richard Albert, who experimented with LSD in the 60s, then went to India, changed his name to Ram Das, and came back to become a guru for the hippie generation. Now he's about 70, and, due to a stroke he suffered in 1997, is wheelchair bound.  &quot;I never expected old age to be like this,&quot; he says with difficulty, as his speech is slow now as he struggles to find the right words.  The camera takes us right with him on his daily routine.  Aides help him dress and drive him to his many therapy appointments and we are witness to his acupuncture as well as speech and physical therapy sessions.There's background of course, home movies of him as a child in the 1930s, one of three lively siblings whose father was the president of the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad.  There's some footage of him with a fresh face and short cropped hair as a professor at Harvard as he and Timothy Leary saw the mind altering drugs of the time as a major breakthrough in human psychology.  And then we see him with his guru in India, taking on the spiritually that was even more powerful than the drugs.  He then returned home, bearded and dressed in what his father described as a &quot;bedsheet&quot;, and held outdoor yogi sessions for his hundreds of his followers right on the golf course of his family's New Hampshire estate.  His book, &quot;Be Here Now&quot; became a best seller and is still in print.But now he's an old man, struggling with his physical challenges.  Much of the film focuses on him this way, and sometimes it's hard to watch as he's learning to live with his limitations.  I was impatient with some of these scenes, in which he struggles to speak; I would have much preferred the film tto be about his history, rather than his present. However, I realize that the film is exactly what he intended it to be and it gives a powerful message.  He's now a guru to the aging baby boomers and he's a living example of how to deal with old age with dignity.  Aging is a natural part of life and we all have to learn to live with it.

I wish more would get reacquainted with the REAL Ram Dass--he definitely is better than the competition, or the stank his abusers have caused.Now, I always thought Ram Dass was some sort of guru-for-money-60's-guy, but after this, I see not.  He's very intellectual, and encourages self-examination, thoughtfulness  and kindness.As with any lifestyle, beware the radical stupid followers.  This is the same with any religion.  They ruin it for the leader and the rest of society.I admit that I had to overcome some prejudices against the Ram Dass generation.The Me-Generation out here has misappropriated Ram Dass's ideas to retool ethics to where everything they do is ""enlightened"", no matter how narcissistic, abusive and neglectful---and they really mess up other folks around them and their own children.  They've turned into no-better than any other religious addiction.In his film, I saw the followers dancing around in awkward and unnatural ways totally alien to Indian culture---but seen every where on the west coast.  I call it the Dance-of-Milkfed-Wannabes-Rebelling-Against-Super-Square-Background-But-Still-Clueless-&-Dancing-Like-Windmill.  (Indian music and dancing, I've always found to be pleasant and graceful.)  So many folks here are overly desperate to be cult followers, and get all glassy-eyed and irrational about the obsession of the month.In the city where I live, you see the exact same hippie dance, where the attention-ho seems to think arm-flailing like a zombie in inappropriate places shows everybody they are enlightened, even though nobody else is dancing, there's too many breakables, and other people looking on in horror & snickering.That and watching 20-year-old hippie infants, who've been told by Mommy & Daddy that everything they do is wonderful and natural, sit in cafes, pick their noses and eat it, plus eat with their mouths open & food falling out.  I cannot believe that was a kindness by their parents---why would they make the kid so repulsive?Anyway, his stuff is good, it's a good way of thinking, and it's a good way to deal with the abusers of his system or any other system.",5,"Very informative, Interesting & Useful",1082505600,"04 21, 2004",2004,2467,"['urge', 'everybody', 'reexamine', 'Ram', 'Dass', 'intelligently', 'not', 'stupidly', 'better', 'alternative', 'Neo-Christian', 'Taliban', 'intelligent', 'method', 'dealing', 'emotional', 'grifters', 'who', ""'ve"", 'misappropriated', 'methods.Before', 'chanced', 'OPB', 'saw', 'Ram', 'Dass', 'books', 'garage', 'sales', 'thrift', 'stores', 'west', 'coast', 'wish', 'more', 'would', 'get', 'reacquainted', 'REAL', 'Ram', 'Dass', 'definitely', 'better', 'competition', 'stank', 'abusers', 'have', 'caused.Now', 'always', 'thought', 'Ram', 'Dass', 'was', 'sort', ""guru-for-money-60's-guy"", 'see', 'not', 'very', 'intellectual', 'self-examination', 'thoughtfulness', 'kindness.As', 'lifestyle', 'beware', 'radical', 'stupid', 'followers', 'same', 'religion', 'ruin', 'leader', 'rest', 'society.I', 'admit', 'had', 'overcome', 'prejudices', 'Ram', 'Dass', 'generation.The', 'Me-Generation', 'here', 'misappropriated', 'Ram', 'Dass', 'ideas', 'retool', 'ethics', 'where', 'everything', 'do', 'enlightened', 'matter', 'how', 'narcissistic', 'abusive', 'neglectful', '-and', 'really', 'mess', 'up', 'other', 'folks', 'own', 'children', ""'ve"", 'turned', 'no-better', 'other', 'religious', 'film', 'saw', 'followers', 'dancing', 'around', 'awkward', 'unnatural', 'ways', 'totally', 'alien', 'Indian', 'culture', '-but', 'seen', 'where', 'west', 'coast', 'call', 'Dance-of-Milkfed-Wannabes-Rebelling-Against-Super-Square-Background-But-Still-Clueless-', '-Dancing-Like-Windmill', 'Indian', 'music', 'dancing', ""'ve"", 'always', 'found', 'be', 'pleasant', 'graceful', 'So', 'many', 'folks', 'here', 'are', 'overly', 'desperate', 'be', 'cult', 'followers', 'get', 'glassy-eyed', 'irrational', 'obsession', 'month.In', 'city', 'where', 'live', 'see', 'exact', 'same', 'hippie', 'dance', 'where', 'attention-ho', 'think', 'arm-flailing', 'zombie', 'inappropriate', 'places', 'everybody', 'are', 'enlightened', 'even', 'nobody', 'else', 'dancing', 'too', 'many', 'breakables', 'other', 'people', 'looking', 'horror', 'snickering.That', 'watching', '20-year-old', 'hippie', 'infants', 'who', ""'ve"", 'been', 'told', 'Mommy', 'Daddy', 'everything', 'do', 'wonderful', 'natural', 'sit', 'cafes', 'pick', 'noses', 'eat', 'eat', 'mouths', 'open', 'food', 'falling', 'out', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'was', 'kindness', 'parents', '-why', 'would', 'make', 'kid', 'so', 'repulsive', 'Anyway', 'stuff', 'good', 'good', 'way', 'thinking', 'good', 'way', 'deal', 'abusers', 'system', 'other', 'system']",Ram Dass: Fierce Grace

It included a bit of biography on Ram Dass along with deep vulnerable sharing in terms of how his life changed after he had a stroke, the inner struggles involved and where he stumbled.I have met Ram Dass in person and up to that point, I wasn't a huge fan.  However, hearing him talk life, I understood there was more to him than I originally thought.  He had a quality of presence, sincerity and empathy that was palpable.  Somehow... the producers of this video managed to capture much of this.When my mom had her stroke, my dad started CPR within 90 seconds and saved her life.  However, my dad felt guilty and wondered if he did the right thing by saving her.  When I posed this question to Ram Dass in person, he started to cry and after more than a minute, he said.... ""If your dad jumping into action was motivated by love... how could it be the wrong choice?""  I felt bowled over by the wisdom and empathy of his response and somehow that helped me to shift my relationship to that event as well.  I tell this story because I think it illustrates an important point that Ram Dass isn't merely a ""hippy guru"" struggling with a stroke and old age.  He has learned a lot over the years and has much to offer us in terms of understanding old age and illness from the inside.

What is disappointing about this film is how post-stroke aphasia has affected the man's ability to speak so clearly, precisely, and eloquently. Watching the film, I kept thinking that the film's editors were making him seem more articulate than he now is.I gather from those who speak highly of Ram Dass that you literally have to *be there* with him to fully grasp the impact of his presence as a teacher. A lengthy scene at the end of the film records a session with a young woman who comes to him for help dealing with the violent death of a dear friend. The camera attempts to capture what transpires during that meeting, but I think it's very difficult to tell to what extent the force of his presence (given his difficulty with language) has in the situation. It may have been profound or superficial - it's really hard to tell for sure, and that is, I think, a problem with the film.Others here have blamed the filmmakers, and I don't know if that criticism is fair. The medium of film, with its attention to surfaces, is handicapped in dealing with a subject like this. I would recommend this film only for people who are already fans of Ram Dass. And if you are older, don't look for much insight into aging. To that extent, the film shows him at a reading of a new book about this subject, and if you aren't troubled too much by the obvious role played by his editor (which we see in one scene), you may find the book more illuminating than this film.",3,Maybe an unfilmable subject . . .,1221264000,"09 13, 2008",2008,1770,"['Knowing', 'younger', 'Ram', 'Dass', 'recordings', 'talks', 'devoted', 'appreciative', 'audiences', 'was', 'familiar', 'immensely', 'articulate', 'affective', 'advocate', 'Eastern', 'spirituality', 'able', 'speak', 'familiar', 'voice', 'accessible', 'vocabulary', 'subject', 'language', 'reason', 'What', 'disappointing', 'film', 'how', 'post-stroke', 'aphasia', 'affected', 'man', 'ability', 'speak', 'so', 'clearly', 'precisely', 'eloquently', 'Watching', 'film', 'kept', 'thinking', 'film', 'editors', 'were', 'making', 'seem', 'more', 'articulate', 'now', 'is.I', 'gather', 'who', 'speak', 'highly', 'Ram', 'Dass', 'literally', 'have', '*be', 'there*', 'fully', 'grasp', 'impact', 'presence', 'teacher', 'lengthy', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'records', 'session', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'help', 'dealing', 'violent', 'death', 'dear', 'friend', 'camera', 'capture', 'what', 'meeting', 'think', 'very', 'difficult', 'tell', 'what', 'extent', 'force', 'presence', 'given', 'difficulty', 'language', 'situation', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'profound', 'superficial', 'really', 'hard', 'tell', 'sure', 'think', 'problem', 'film.Others', 'here', 'have', 'blamed', 'filmmakers', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'criticism', 'fair', 'medium', 'film', 'attention', 'surfaces', 'handicapped', 'dealing', 'subject', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'already', 'fans', 'Ram', 'Dass', 'are', 'older', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'much', 'insight', 'aging', 'extent', 'film', 'reading', 'new', 'book', 'subject', 'are', ""n't"", 'troubled', 'too', 'much', 'obvious', 'role', 'played', 'editor', 'see', 'one', 'scene', 'may', 'find', 'book', 'more', 'illuminating', 'film']",Ram Dass: Fierce Grace
739005,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,B00008DDV1,Wayne C. Rogers,"[15, 15]","My first introduction to Ram Dass (aka Dr. Richard Albert) came in December of 1984.  I was managing a bookstore in my hometown in North Carolina, and an elderly lady came in one night just before closing.  My mother had died of cancer several months before, and I was in a state of severed depression about my life and where I was headed.  The lady walked around the store for a number of minutes, and then came up to the counter and laid a cassette tape down it.  Now, I didn't know who this lady was.  I'd never seen her before, nor did I ever see her again.  She said that she wanted me to have the tape and that it would help to ease my emotional pain and suffering.  I didn't know how she knew about that and felt somewhat embarrassed by her comment.  I didn't want the tape and attempted to give it back to her.  That was when she mentioned my mother and said that I was being watched over by her.  I didn't know what to say.  The lady left the store.  Against my better, I listened to the tape that night.  It was a lecture by someone that I'd never heard of.  The man's name was Ram Dass, and he was speaking to a group of people about living and suffering, and how all of this is nothing more than another method for learning about ourselves as spiritual beings.  There was a truth to his words that touched something deep within me.  I could hear the honesty in his voice as he talked about his own life and the struggles that he had to work through.  I have no doubt that the tape saved my life that winter.  Afterwards, I began to search for more tapes by this unusual gentleman and discovered a wealth of information in both tape and book form.Twenty-two years later, Ram Dass is once again in my life in the form of a documentary by Mickey Lemle called Ram Dass: Fierce Grace.  The documentary was done in 2001 and deals with the major stroke that Ram Dass had in 1997, as well as flashbacks to his early years as a child, a Harvard professor, a spiritual seeker in India, a guru to the baby boomers of the sixties, and as the best selling author of Be Here Now.  Ram Dass has always said that his message was simply his own personal journey through life.  That was what he had to share with others who sought a clearer understanding about life and why we're here.  During the documentary, we get to see Ram Dass and how the stroke has changed his own life with numerous sessions of therapy, learning to talk again and to be able to find the right words to express his thoughts, and still being here to help other people on their own special journey of inner discovery.  We also get to see the early years of Ram Dass, especially with his spiritual guru, Neem Karoli Baba, and with his father after he returns home from India.  It was enlightening to see his father, who was very upper class, deal with his son returning from a third-world country, dressed in a white robe and having a long beard, with hundreds of people flocking to their home in New Hampshire to listen to this ""servant of God"" speak about his own journey toward understanding.  Some how, on a deeper level, his father knew that he was doing something that would help others.  As the DVD ends, Ram Dass talks about his new journey, which deals with aging and strokes and still being here and a new way to find true grace in his actions.Though I'd seen pictures of Ram Dass over the years and had listened to countless cassette tapes, I'd never seen him in person.  This DVD is probably as close as I'll ever get to him.  It was certainly an eye-opening experience, and it made me realize that there was vital information here that I needed to know because I'm now 56 and dealing with the aging process and my own unique journey.  It was also fun to finally see Wavy Gravy.  I've heard so much about him over the years and his acute sense of humor.  And yes, he did make me laugh.  I do wish, however, that the documentary had been longer.  There's an extra twenty minutes of scenes in the Special Features, but it was still too short.  I could've easily sat through another ninety minutes, listening to Ram Dass talk about perception and reality and how each person has chosen a particular path to follow with its own challenges and mellow drama and methods for achieving self-realization.  There were a number of scenes in the documentary that will have you crying.  The biggest one deals with the parents of Rachel, a young teen who was raped and murdered.  Ram Dass wrote them a letter with regards to their tragedy, and it helped them to over-come their rage and helplessness at what had happened to their daughter.  When the mother of Rachel reads the letter, it definitely brings you to tears.  Another scene has Ram Dass listening to a young woman as she talks about the murder of her boyfriend and how she's trying to understand why this has happened.  What she has to say brings Ram Dass to sudden tears as her words touch his heart.  Needless to say, Ram Dass: Fierce Grace has an important message to deliver to those who are ready to hear it.  As Ram Dass says, when you're ready, all it takes is a simple word or action to open the door to your awareness.  Then, you're able to walk through it with better clarity as to why we're here and the many different roles that we play throughout our life.  This is powerful stuff, but if you're not ready, it'll be meaningless to you.
