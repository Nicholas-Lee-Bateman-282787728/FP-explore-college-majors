It is a highly disturbing meditation on small town interactions with a lot to chew on.  I didn't think I'd watch it more than once, but I had questions about the storyline so I watched it a second time.  No doubt I will watch it a third time as well.  There is a lot of subtlety in this movie and much to absorb.  I recommend finding the interview with the writer/director as well.

1554485,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,B008J7QSVQ,K. Boullosa,"[9, 11]","I have a region-free DVD player so was able to order this Region 2 DVD from an Australian vendor.  However, I had to turn up the volume on my DVD player to the max to hear the actors clearly, and even then lost some of the dialogue - I do not know what the problem is, as I have many Region 2 DVDs from the UK and have not had similar problems with those.This is an intriguing story with some narrative uncertainties, redeemed by the excellent performances of the cast (Benedict Cumberbatch, Claire Foy, and Shaun Evans).  The narrative is a familiar one that has been done before: a seemingly happily married couple (Cumberbatch and Foy) welcome into their midst the husband's sibling (Evans), who has been away for years, and his return unseals old cans of worms that upset the stability of the marriage.David and Dawn, both schoolteachers, have returned to David's natal village in Kent to live a quiet life and try to conceive a much longed for child.  Both teach locally, they are slowly fixing up a cottage that they have bought, they keep a few chickens, she sings in the church choir. As no pregnancy has yet occurred, David and Dawn are at the stage of seeking medical advice.  Apart from this anxiety, their lives seem happy and their marriage secure.However, an air of quiet foreboding is almost immediately palpable - something humid and ominous is conveyed by the very striking cinematography.  As soon as David's brother, Nick, who has been gone for six years, appears unannounced, this atmosphere becomes more troubling.  At first, all seems well between David and Nick, but it quickly becomes clear that Nick suffers from emotional disturbances, and he begins to reveal to Dawn in an artless fashion details of the lives of the villagers, and of his and David's past, that horrify and upset Dawn.The film seems to flow like a stream around the many rocks that are uncovered at intervals, as David and Dawn try to hold onto their marital equilibrium. Because of the maddening difficulty of hearing the actors, this viewer had to piece together the truth at the end of the film - it wasn't hard to do, given the trail that led to the final frames, but still, it would have been nice not to have to.The performances are fine - no one puts a foot wrong and it is clear the actors received excellent directing.  At first, one seems to see everything through Dawn's eyes, but then the characters seem to switch off and David seems to take center stage, and then Nick, and then it is the two brothers who are center stage.Somehow, though, too many threads are left dangling, not so much of plot, but of reasons why the characters took certain actions.  There is something not quite ""finished"" about the narrative and one is left feeling vaguely unsatisfied after the last frames.Something about this story did not live up to its full potential.  As the fault clearly did not lie with the acting or the directing or the visual presentation, the writing has to be the weak link here.Just the same, this is an interesting film and hardly a waste of time, especially given the performances of its cast.",3,"Atmospheric Tale, Fine Ensemble Performances",1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,3107,"['have', 'region-free', 'DVD', 'player', 'so', 'was', 'able', 'order', 'Region', '2', 'DVD', 'Australian', 'vendor', 'However', 'had', 'turn', 'up', 'volume', 'DVD', 'player', 'max', 'hear', 'actors', 'clearly', 'even', 'then', 'lost', 'dialogue', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'problem', 'have', 'many', 'Region', '2', 'DVDs', 'UK', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'similar', 'problems', 'those.This', 'intriguing', 'story', 'narrative', 'uncertainties', 'redeemed', 'excellent', 'performances', 'cast', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'Claire', 'Foy', 'Shaun', 'Evans', 'narrative', 'familiar', 'one', 'been', 'done', 'seemingly', 'happily', 'married', 'couple', 'Cumberbatch', 'Foy', 'welcome', 'midst', 'husband', 'sibling', 'Evans', 'who', 'been', 'away', 'years', 'return', 'unseals', 'old', 'cans', 'worms', 'upset', 'stability', 'marriage.David', 'Dawn', 'schoolteachers', 'have', 'returned', 'David', 'natal', 'village', 'Kent', 'live', 'quiet', 'life', 'try', 'conceive', 'much', 'longed', 'child', 'teach', 'locally', 'are', 'slowly', 'fixing', 'up', 'cottage', 'have', 'bought', 'keep', 'few', 'chickens', 'church', 'choir', 'pregnancy', 'yet', 'occurred', 'David', 'Dawn', 'are', 'stage', 'seeking', 'medical', 'advice', 'Apart', 'anxiety', 'lives', 'seem', 'happy', 'marriage', 'secure.However', 'air', 'quiet', 'foreboding', 'almost', 'immediately', 'palpable', 'something', 'humid', 'ominous', 'conveyed', 'very', 'striking', 'cinematography', 'As', 'soon', 'David', 'brother', 'Nick', 'who', 'been', 'gone', 'six', 'years', 'unannounced', 'atmosphere', 'more', 'troubling', 'first', 'well', 'David', 'Nick', 'quickly', 'clear', 'Nick', 'suffers', 'emotional', 'disturbances', 'reveal', 'Dawn', 'artless', 'fashion', 'details', 'lives', 'villagers', 'David', 'past', 'horrify', 'upset', 'Dawn.The', 'film', 'flow', 'stream', 'many', 'rocks', 'are', 'uncovered', 'intervals', 'David', 'Dawn', 'try', 'hold', 'onto', 'marital', 'equilibrium', 'maddening', 'difficulty', 'hearing', 'actors', 'viewer', 'had', 'piece', 'together', 'truth', 'end', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'hard', 'do', 'given', 'trail', 'led', 'final', 'frames', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'not', 'have', 'to.The', 'performances', 'are', 'fine', 'one', 'foot', 'wrong', 'clear', 'actors', 'received', 'excellent', 'directing', 'first', 'one', 'see', 'everything', 'Dawn', 'eyes', 'then', 'characters', 'seem', 'switch', 'off', 'David', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'then', 'Nick', 'then', 'two', 'brothers', 'who', 'are', 'center', 'stage.Somehow', 'though', 'too', 'many', 'threads', 'are', 'left', 'dangling', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'plot', 'reasons', 'why', 'characters', 'took', 'certain', 'actions', 'something', 'not', 'quite', 'finished', 'narrative', 'one', 'left', 'feeling', 'vaguely', 'unsatisfied', 'last', 'frames.Something', 'story', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'full', 'potential', 'fault', 'clearly', 'did', 'not', 'lie', 'acting', 'directing', 'visual', 'presentation', 'writing', 'be', 'weak', 'link', 'here.Just', 'same', 'interesting', 'film', 'hardly', 'waste', 'time', 'especially', 'given', 'performances', 'cast']",N/A

One cannot get enough of his soul-piercing gaze, his eyes the color of a summer storm ;)He plays his part brilliantly - his role is that of a teacher named David, married to Dawn (played by Claire Foy - an actress I don't think I've seen before), who's also a teacher. Dawn wants to start a family, and David's brother, Nick, a troubled soldier, is added to the mix and comes to live with the couple for a while. Family secrets come to light, and Dawn begins to wonder how well she even knows her husband. She is noticed by a married man with whom she sings in the choir.At the beginning (and even toward the middle) of the film I was intrigued, but once I was about two-thirds of the way through I felt myself growing slightly less interested. However, I kept watching - I wanted to know what happened! In my opinion there were many directions the movie could have taken to have become better. However, I do admire David's love for his wife, and at the closing scene I picked up on tension where I think David knows much more about her secrets than what he's saying.This isn't a movie I'd watch again, I think, but most of the plots definitely pull you in and make you want to keep watching.

And, it takes some twists and turns before we get a feel for what is exactly happening.Dawn, played by Claire Foy, a beautiful young woman with mesmerizing eyes, and her husband, David, played by Benedict Cumberbatch  have moved back to his childhood village in England. They are both teachers, David teaches disabled students and Claire a regular young class. They have purchased an old broken down house, to repair. In the meantime they live in a mess of peeling wall paper. It appears they have running water and electricity. They have chickens and a dog who must be looked after constantly, so that he does not get in the chicken coop.  And, they are visiting a specialist to discover why they have not become pregnant.On a bright summer's day, Claire comes home to find her brother-in-law, Nick, played by Shaun Evans, on the roof having climbed a ladder to look around. Right away, we feel a foreboding of things to come. Nick is on leave from Afghanistan, suffering from PTSD, and no one has any notice he will be visiting. We feel the tense atmosphere, something is not right with David and Nick's relationship. A sexual tension is also present, and at a pub with friends, we learn Nick and the wife of a friend had a thing going on. The PTSD becomes more pronounced, Claire learns a secret her husband is keeping from her. It all comes to a head, and this strange but well acted film comes to a sudden close.Benedict Cumberbatch is such a superb actor, and he takes over this film. Claire Foy as the unsettled wife, demure, sexy and well intentioned, is perfection in this role. This must have been a film that never took off. I have not heard of it, but the name Benedict Cumberbatch drew me in.

1554497,A2K3ZJWLF0V4K,B008J7QSVQ,"Rachel Holland ""miribeau""","[34, 36]","Dictynna Hood's 2011 masterpiece, Wreckers, was a film I very nearly did not watch. Descriptions ranged from the general to the specific with horrid ""Lifetime Movies"" (for lonely women) teasers, quite similar to ""a woman's distrust of her husband grows"" and ""a young woman slowly realizes her husband is not who she thinks he is when his brother returns home with secrets of his own"", only worse and more insulting to the audience trying to decide if this was a film worth watching. To be clear, neither of these descriptions accurately describes this film and they should be ignored entirely (no matter how many times you have read similar taglines).Wreckers is a drama, a romance, a mystery, a portrait of deceit and pain, a war film and, most surprisingly, a brilliantly realistic portrayal of the sort of marriage most of us first witnessed in Alfred Hitchcock's Suspicion (which was fantastic and ridiculous, all stirred up in a glass of milk with a light bulb, but entirely unbelievable, whereas this is deliberate and pulls at the viewer without that element of classic Hitchcockian sensationalism that put the light bulb in the milk in the first place). Told in linear fashion, in the present, yet somehow clear in the assertion that the core story of the film takes place in the past, possibly years ago, the film only materializes before us as a manifestation of the pained memory of the female lead, looking back, almost as if from a fever or dream that pulled her back to this place and time to relive the summer when she finally met her husband, not the body or the eager prospective mate, but, the personality behind the faade. This meeting is facilitated by the arrival of a brother home from war, a brother who knows and has always known just who this man, his older brother, ally and enemy, has come to be.David (portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch) and his beautiful wife, Dawn (portrayed by Claire Foy, the reason I'd even heard of this film during a limited release) are young, in love, living in a small countryside village, teaching, each separately, giving the viewer a clear view into the absolute fact that these are not bad people. They care, each of them, for the children they teach and the life they are building for themselves and their future offspring in the broken down home they are rehabilitating and the relationship they are inventing, all in the pursuit of that family life they both desire. With the arrival of Nick (portrayed by Shaun Evans), a soldier with a clear case of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, home to seek comfort and protection from an obviously uncomfortable and increasingly secretive David, the impact of one wild card on the delicate balance of sexual attraction, affection, and tactical deception that all couples enter into during those first lust-filled years is immediately felt. Early on, mention is made of childhood abuse, as though the torment of knowing your kid brother is fighting and killing and narrowly escaping the violence of a theater of war is not enough for a man to conceal. It is abuse that David has never mentioned to Dawn. From here, the web unravels, slowly, as if woven of old cotton thread, disintegrating unpredictably with the slightest touch of wind or water. The revelations themselves matter less than the cold truth of their existence behind that curtain and the effect they will have on that delicate balance that allowed two people to trap each other in a marriage of strangers in love.A clear examination of deceit in marriage, lies men tell, lies women accept, lies men live with in desperate hope of being loved and lies women pour out into the world with little warning in the hope of building a better future, Wreckers hits hard for a small film that feels very much like theater in scope and in the high level of intimacy on screen between all actors in nearly every scene. The connections feel as real as if the actors were standing in front of the viewer, alive, casting breath onto each other as they whispered and cried, but the isolated memories and pieces of dreams and half-heard conversations that populate the film leave no doubt that this would never have worked as a play (where conversations seem to go on forever, long after they should have ended). The dialogue is tight, the acting superb, and the surprise, in a film clearly intended to be all about the lies and the fallout, is the inclusion of a remarkable examination of violence. Governmental or political violence, family violence, male violence, the violence of an idea or remark, the violence of sex or a sexual betrayal and the violence of trust, all play large roles in the landscape of this film in ways that cannot be detailed without ruining the slow burn of emotional turmoil presented so expertly in Wreckers.So here is what I can say. I hope you will give this film a try and, for goodness sake, pay attention. This one's worth the time, whether you've been there or not, in that marriage, in that life, the victim of violence who thought they could start over if they just kept their mouth shut, the victim of a regime or government who didn't know how to say everything was falling apart, the victim of anything or anyone who never thought you'd go far enough to be the one others saw as victimizing. This one is absolutely worth the time.",5,"Slow Burn Disintegration, Like They Did It In The Old Days.
