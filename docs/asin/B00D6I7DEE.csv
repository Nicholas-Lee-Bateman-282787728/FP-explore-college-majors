This movie  glosses over the fact that Daniel's people suffered a huge injustice and that he was kidnapped and forced to serve his transgressers and jumps into his tormentors seeking wise counsel from the injured party.I have been on the receiving end of service providers who refuse to fulfill their fiduciary duty and represent their client's best interests so I know it sucks.  But as far as I know, I have never wronged the service provider as Daniel was wronged.This is a story of foreign kings being advised by their &#34;slave&#34; Daniel.  The first king was advised to be unfrugal and build a giant gold statue in his image and force others to worship him.  Anyone who remembers those Easter Sunday airings of The Ten Commandments knows that the Jews are not into idols be they solid gold cows or solid gold Nebuchanezzers.  So why would someone advise you to do something that they themselves would not do?Because you lack the moral compass to sniff out bad advice when you lacked the moral compass to not invade and enslave an entire tribe and expected them to serve you wholeheartedly.The second king was some kind of useless despot whose lack of hygiene prompted disrespect for the sacred gold goblets in the Jewish house of worship.  Is this a true story or just an allegory told to the final king about respecting someone else's religion?These events may have actually occurred but probably by the time the first king built that expensive demonstration of his own ego and intellect, it would be a good idea to let the Jews go home.I don't think the Fugu Plan was well-received when it was broached.",2,being nice to your tormentors to try to survive them,1396396800,"04 2, 2014",2014,1906,"['Maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'kidnap', ""'d"", '34', 'serve', '34', 'better', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'bible', 'so', 'had', 'idea', 'who', 'Daniel', 'was', 'knew', 'Simon', 'Scharma', 'lastest', 'documentary', 'series', 'was', 'first', 'great', 'crimes', 'Jewish', 'people', 'removed', 'homeland', 'movie', 'fact', 'Daniel', 'people', 'suffered', 'huge', 'injustice', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'forced', 'serve', 'transgressers', 'jumps', 'tormentors', 'seeking', 'wise', 'counsel', 'injured', 'party.I', 'have', 'been', 'receiving', 'end', 'service', 'providers', 'who', 'refuse', 'fulfill', 'fiduciary', 'duty', 'represent', 'client', 'best', 'interests', 'so', 'know', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'have', 'never', 'wronged', 'service', 'provider', 'Daniel', 'was', 'wronged.This', 'story', 'foreign', 'kings', 'being', 'advised', '34', 'slave', '34', 'Daniel', 'first', 'king', 'was', 'advised', 'be', 'unfrugal', 'build', 'giant', 'gold', 'statue', 'image', 'force', 'others', 'worship', 'Anyone', 'who', 'Easter', 'Sunday', 'airings', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'Jews', 'are', 'not', 'idols', 'be', 'solid', 'gold', 'cows', 'solid', 'gold', 'Nebuchanezzers', 'So', 'why', 'would', 'someone', 'advise', 'do', 'something', 'would', 'not', 'do', 'lack', 'moral', 'compass', 'sniff', 'out', 'bad', 'advice', 'when', 'lacked', 'moral', 'compass', 'not', 'invade', 'enslave', 'entire', 'tribe', 'expected', 'serve', 'wholeheartedly.The', 'second', 'king', 'was', 'kind', 'useless', 'despot', 'lack', 'hygiene', 'prompted', 'disrespect', 'sacred', 'gold', 'goblets', 'Jewish', 'house', 'worship', 'true', 'story', 'just', 'allegory', 'told', 'final', 'king', 'respecting', 'someone', 'else', 'religion', 'events', 'may', 'have', 'actually', 'occurred', 'probably', 'time', 'first', 'king', 'built', 'expensive', 'demonstration', 'own', 'ego', 'intellect', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'let', 'Jews', 'go', 'home.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Fugu', 'Plan', 'was', 'well-received', 'when', 'was', 'broached']",N/A

MGM has never been known for their biblical accuracy so I did expect Pure Flix to get it right and they did. For a small budget film they really put together a fine little picture. Since the budget for sets was obviously not available the director and crew used mostly closeups which worked out very well. The script was pretty good and most of the actors did a fine job. The makeup was lacking more then any other technical aspect.  Except for one non-bloody sword thrust and mature subject matter the movie is PG.

A magoi was from Persia and would be traveling with a calvary of 100 men or more.  Daniel would have selected kings in Persia.  To have him wondering in the desert is a downgrade to his character.  Even worse to wonder into a defeated enemies camp.  Historically this is a way to deceive folks thru entertainment to not find truth.  A money maker movie as many are.  Be careful what you watch and follow.  The path of this film is away from Biblical truth.  Daniel is a magoi of Persia.  I recomend you study this history to understand.
