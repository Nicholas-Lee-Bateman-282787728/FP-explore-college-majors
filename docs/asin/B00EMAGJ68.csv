1667778,ARK5SAGVLW3FY,B00EMAGJ68,bunnyrabbit4,"[8, 9]","Set in the mid 1920's,Therese, chronicles the  marriage of two French aristocrats whose wealth comes from owning large tracts of land. They live in manor houses on estates covered with pine forests and generally have almost nothing to do beyond hunting, dining and worrying about the respectability of the family name. Tradition runs deep and we quickly learn that everyone adheres closely to it.As the film opens, Therese is shown as a relatively normal teenager playing and laughing with her best friend Anne, whose brother she is expected to marry. We learn that Anne has taken up the aristocratic sport of hunting, which Therese finds appalling but there is little more exposition of Therese's character and the film jumps to her short courtship and marriage.  Therese and her intended, an older man named Bernard, both agree that it is good to marry their forests together, but other than that they appear to have little in common. We assume that the coming marriage will have little passion, but the movie is really about Therese's deeper compulsions.As her wedding approaches there is a short scene with Anne in which Therese states that she is having thoughts she shares with no one and believes that marriage will correct them. She repeats this to Bernard and we get the feeling that perhaps she is protesting the lack of intellectual respect for women and their thoughts. At this point the viewer is prepared to learn more about her views and how they are thwarted by the society she lives in.  Without giving away too many details of the story, my problem with the film stems from the fact that the nature of these thoughts and her subsequent behaviors are never explored or foreshadowed in a satisfying manner.  She maintains an eerie, silent demeanor filled with pregnant glances for most of the film.  While Tautou's acting is engaging, her character does not explain the things she does or what she wants. It is left up to other characters to infer her motives and ambitions because she never once articulates them. In the end the film leaves us with more questions than answers and confuses any ideas we may form about her inner workings and who she wants to be or will become.",3,Flawed but Entertaining,1387065600,"12 15, 2013",2013,2193,"['Set', 'mid', '1920', 'Therese', 'marriage', 'two', 'French', 'aristocrats', 'wealth', 'owning', 'large', 'tracts', 'land', 'live', 'manor', 'houses', 'estates', 'covered', 'pine', 'forests', 'generally', 'have', 'almost', 'nothing', 'do', 'hunting', 'dining', 'worrying', 'respectability', 'family', 'name', 'Tradition', 'deep', 'quickly', 'learn', 'everyone', 'closely', 'it.As', 'film', 'Therese', 'shown', 'relatively', 'normal', 'teenager', 'playing', 'laughing', 'best', 'friend', 'Anne', 'brother', 'expected', 'marry', 'learn', 'Anne', 'taken', 'up', 'aristocratic', 'sport', 'hunting', 'Therese', 'appalling', 'little', 'more', 'exposition', 'Therese', 'character', 'film', 'jumps', 'short', 'courtship', 'marriage', 'Therese', 'intended', 'older', 'man', 'named', 'Bernard', 'agree', 'good', 'marry', 'forests', 'together', 'other', 'appear', 'have', 'little', 'common', 'assume', 'coming', 'marriage', 'will', 'have', 'little', 'passion', 'movie', 'really', 'Therese', 'deeper', 'compulsions.As', 'wedding', 'approaches', 'short', 'scene', 'Anne', 'Therese', 'states', 'having', 'thoughts', 'shares', 'one', 'marriage', 'will', 'correct', 'Bernard', 'get', 'feeling', 'perhaps', 'protesting', 'lack', 'intellectual', 'respect', 'women', 'thoughts', 'point', 'viewer', 'prepared', 'learn', 'more', 'views', 'how', 'are', 'thwarted', 'society', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'many', 'details', 'story', 'problem', 'film', 'fact', 'nature', 'thoughts', 'subsequent', 'behaviors', 'are', 'never', 'explored', 'foreshadowed', 'satisfying', 'manner', 'eerie', 'silent', 'demeanor', 'filled', 'pregnant', 'glances', 'most', 'film', 'Tautou', 'acting', 'engaging', 'character', 'not', 'explain', 'things', 'what', 'left', 'up', 'other', 'characters', 'infer', 'motives', 'ambitions', 'never', 'once', 'end', 'film', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'ideas', 'may', 'form', 'inner', 'workings', 'who', 'be', 'will', 'become']",Therese

Much of the story is told with a minimum of strokes, so don't expect to have it all spelled out.  There are also no clear-cut answers or endings, so if that drives you crazy you might want to skip it.  If you enjoyed the last film by Miller/Tautou - Secret - you'll probably be up for this one.

That may be one of the trappings of the creative process &#8211; it&#8217;s easy for the author or a screenwriter to fully understand the gradations of character, but putting all of that up in lights takes an awful lot of talent.  Talent of a producer.  Talent of a director.  Talent of the actors.  If any individual piece is out of place, then the entire examination might come apart at the seams, leaving those trying to grasp it all with only hints of what to make of it all.  It doesn&#8217;t mean that the film will be wasted; it only means that it probably won&#8217;t be appreciated as deeply as all originally intended.The same could be said about life, after all.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)Young Th&eacute;r&egrave;se (played by the darling of French cinema herself, the lovely Audrey Tautou) spends her days in the beautiful, wooded region of Landes in southwest France running through the pines with her best friend, Anna (an equally lovely Anais Demoustier).  To keep their families together, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se weds Anna&#8217;s brother Bernard (Gilles Lellouche, in an understated performance).  However, when it appears Anna&#8217;s found love with a young Portuguese man outside the preferred family lines, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se begins a carefully crafted descent into unraveling not only her own attempt at happiness but also everyone&#8217;s around her, including her traditionalist husband.THERESE is the kind of drama that only the French could perfect.  There&#8217;s always an air of aristocracy to everything their characters do, and there&#8217;s usually a heavy nuance of rebelliousness that&#8217;s helped define a nation of people who so proudly brought us high art.  So, naturally, THERESE strives to combine the meaty treatises of social class, heartfelt expressions of love, and family responsibility in ways that the dramatic cinema of other countries can&#8217;t quite match (even if they tried); and, in some regards, it features some solid, convincing performances of its big and smaller players, all photographed in terrific period detail equally unmatched around the globe.Unfortunately, there&#8217;s also a general vacuousness to its story.  &#8220;Girl meets boy, girl marries boy, and then it all goes south&#8221; is simply the best way to describe its narrative and, for the life of me, I couldn&#8217;t so make as give you a hint as to why.  As it&#8217;s based on a novel, I&#8217;m stuck wondering if perhaps there&#8217;s plenty lost in translation from the page to the screen.Tautou&#8217;s Th&eacute;r&egrave;se &#8211; while obviously the central character here &#8211; never operates from crystal clear motivations.  As viewers, we&#8217;re treated to her descent but only circumstantially teased as to its cause.  Was it a rejection of the social mores of the era?  Was it finding herself in a loveless commitment to a man who clearly loved her?  Was this a case of post-partum depression gradually eating away at one woman&#8217;s soul?  Throwing in some hints at cynicism, feminism, and repression only further cloud the subject; but if director Miller intended for audiences to make up their own minds on the matter, isn&#8217;t that a symptom of intellectual laziness?In contrast, Anna is a woman given a screen life that, while we may not agree with all of it, makes sense.  Perhaps defying her birthright, she fails for a low man &#8211; a handsome sailor with poetic sensibilities &#8211; but her family denies the relationship.  Th&eacute;r&egrave;se even goes so far as to hoax a break-up letter from her lover, forever pitting the two from this point forward as rivals.  While Anna&#8217;s motivations are refreshingly understandable, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se&#8217;s remain more than a bit elusive, and that&#8217;s a weight too heavy for even Tautou to shrug off.This is an exceedingly well-made film.  It boasts some great photography &#8211; almost picturesque in several ways &#8211; along with some terrific acting and even a handful of small, quieter moments.  However, the way the entirety of THERESE unfolds, it&#8217;s difficult to say definitively if Th&eacute;r&egrave;se struggled with a lifelong problem with depression or just plain stupidity.THERESE (aka Therese D; aka Therese Desqueyroux) (2012) is produced by a whole host of partners, including UGC, Les films du 24, Canal+, Cin&eacute;, and many many more (surf on over to IMDB.com for a complete list if you&#8217;re that interested).  DVD distribution (stateside) is being handled through MPI Home Video.  For those needing it spelled out perfectly, this is a French-spoken-language release with English subtitles available (there is no English-dubbed track).  As for the technical specifications, the film has obviously been crafted with tremendous care &#8211; complete with some exceptional cinematography &#8211; so you can rest assured that you&#8217;ll enjoy the highest quality sight and sound.  Also &#8211; again only for clarity&#8217;s sake &#8211; I&#8217;d be remiss if I didn&#8217;t point out that this is a cinematic adaptation of Francois Mauriac&#8217;s 1927 novel.  Sadly (and lastly), there are no special features, and that&#8217;s a H-U-G-E miss: I would&#8217;ve liked something by way of Cliff Notes to go along with what the director, writer, and actors all thought and brought to this material &#8230; but, alas, it wasn&#8217;t meant to be.(MILDLY) RECOMMENDED.  It isn&#8217;t as if THERESE fails as a motion picture; rather it only fails as a character study.  Our heroine (or is that anti-heroine?) goes through the motions of some modest highs and lowly lows, yet there&#8217;s no undercurrent that helps it all make perfect sense.  In fact, director Miller fails to convince me that even he had made up his mind about what was truly at the heart of one woman&#8217;s motivations, let alone a few others along for the ride.  Because we&#8217;re given no clear investment, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se (as a character) seems fairly one-dimensional; when one has the world at her fingertips, why let it all slip away?  Disinterest?  Malaise?  Fate?  Instead of making us understand her plight, Miller instead has his players hit their marks &#8211; which they do with great effectiveness &#8211; and leaves the heavy lifting to us.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at MPI Home Video provided me with a DVD copy of THERESE by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",3,THERESE Is A

1667781,A3EHIGO4FNILXP,B00EMAGJ68,.fgd,"[1, 1]","This is no historical drama to merely entertain. What is flawless is its sense of research, historial context and the role of women in soceity; at least at the bourgiouse level in Europe during 1930s. Many times during the film,  it could be set well inside the 19th century such was the power of tradition in soceity before the 2nd world war. I loved the very last shot of Therese and the sense of modernity to become,especially for women's rights. The film does entertain too as a clean-cut drama. Mainly it is a vehicle to portray women's lot in life regarding marriage,which had been a buisness arrangement for centuries. In fact women were grateful for the security it offered financially. Being in love was not a priority. My own reading of history is that the 18th century and before was less stuffy and fearfull than the 19th century. The jokes were more coarse and open. A servant did not regard himself a lesser mortal than his master; just unlucky enough not to be born filthy rich. In the 19th century soceity , the class system became a fortress. There were huge profits to be made by Empire and the Industrial Revolution so long as they were not spread amongst the populace and everyone knew their place. This film is stricly a domestic drama than the historical context i refer to but its influence is sensed throughout.The film revolves around Therese. The elephant in the room no-one discusses is women's sexuality. Her husband must be baffled by Therese's retaliation. Let alone the adultery she had in store for him. He has not a clue that he is supposed to try to be her lover too. Nor should he when even she told him she married him for his estate. She is already being influenced by the scent of modernity to come. He lives as firmly as his ancestors always did. The nuances abound in this film. What's more the film becomes more engrossing as it moves along.

1667783,A1GQAKL9CGQLP1,B00EMAGJ68,L. M. Keefer,"[5, 5]","It is the summer of 1922.  Two French girls, Therese (Audrey Tautou) and Anne (Anais Demoustier), nearing the cusp of womanhood are enjoying the simple pleasures of the French countryside.  Riding their bikes, playing tag, and dreaming about the future.  Fast-forward six years and Therese is about to marry Anne's brother Bernard (Gilles Lellouch).  We sense the first tinge of trouble when Therese says her head is &#34;too full of ideas&#34; and she hopes marriage will settle her down.  She hopes marriage will save her and she will be &#34;at peace&#34;, she confesses.  These are never good reasons to marry. The viewer may wonder if she has a mental illness.  Later, you may wonder even more.It's a marriage of convenience, rich marrying rich.  The provincial marrying the boor.  As psychologists say, when you marry for money, you earn every cent.  Therese and Bernard will both experience that by the end of this film.  Therese longs for something else.  She glimpses what she longs for when she meets the first love of Anne. Jean (Stanley Weber) talks of spurning conventionality and dreams big dreams.  You sense it is wakening something in her.  But there are so little choices for women who dream, who marry young, and are stuck in the French countryside.  You pity them.  You pity their servants even more.This movie could be titled &#34;Desperate Measures&#34;, as Therese goes to desperate measures to free herself.  She envisions herself doing desperate things.  And she acts on some of her visions.  Therese is not necessarily a sympathetic character, nor is her husband or their families. However, you see how imprisoned she is because of the times, narrow choices for women and her location.  We never discuss feelings, Therese admits to Jean.  We discuss hunting and the weather.I enjoyed watching the film to listen to the French, watch Mme. Tatou (although her lips are pursed most of the time and her expression vacant), and look at the French decor.  The homes of both families are exquisite.  I kept wishing the characters would move so I could see the decor.  However, it's a depressing film.  Tatou has none of her familiar sparkle - it has been stamped out by her depression and repression. The film doesn't resolve much as Therese's desires are so ill-formed.  She doesn't know what she wants as she apparently has been stuck in the French countryside all of her life.  How can you dream of something you have never seen? The character is from my grandmothers' generation, born around the turn of the 20th century.  It's interesting to compare her life to theirs.The movie advances slowly.  It captures the characters' desperation as they are caught in circumstances.  If you like dark, slow moving films which examine circumstances and emotions, you may love the film.  I prefer something more buoyant.  By the end of the film, Therese's circumstances have improved, but you don't see enough of them to be satisfied.  Her husband, the boor, is still living at the beck and call of propriety, being the good old boy as he says. There's one in every generation he says. The film is successful in capturing the emptiness of opportunity and feeling in lives which are lived by convention and not choice.  It is an adaptation of the novel by Franois Mauriac.",3,Desperate Measures,1386892800,"12 13, 2013",2013,3284,"['summer', '1922', 'Two', 'French', 'girls', 'Therese', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'Anne', 'Anais', 'Demoustier', 'nearing', 'cusp', 'womanhood', 'are', 'enjoying', 'simple', 'pleasures', 'French', 'countryside', 'Riding', 'bikes', 'playing', 'tag', 'dreaming', 'future', 'Fast-forward', 'six', 'years', 'Therese', 'marry', 'Anne', 'brother', 'Bernard', 'Gilles', 'Lellouch', 'sense', 'first', 'tinge', 'trouble', 'when', 'Therese', 'head', '34', 'too', 'full', 'ideas', '34', 'marriage', 'will', 'settle', 'down', 'marriage', 'will', 'save', 'will', 'be', '34', 'peace', '34', 'are', 'never', 'good', 'reasons', 'marry', 'viewer', 'may', 'wonder', 'mental', 'illness', 'Later', 'may', 'wonder', 'even', 'marriage', 'convenience', 'rich', 'marrying', 'rich', 'provincial', 'marrying', 'boor', 'psychologists', 'say', 'when', 'marry', 'money', 'earn', 'cent', 'Therese', 'Bernard', 'will', 'experience', 'end', 'film', 'Therese', 'longs', 'something', 'else', 'what', 'when', 'first', 'love', 'Anne', 'Jean', 'Stanley', 'Weber', 'talks', 'spurning', 'conventionality', 'dreams', 'big', 'dreams', 'sense', 'wakening', 'something', 'are', 'so', 'little', 'choices', 'women', 'who', 'dream', 'who', 'marry', 'young', 'are', 'stuck', 'French', 'countryside', 'pity', 'pity', 'servants', 'even', 'more.This', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'titled', '34', 'Desperate', 'Measures', '34', 'Therese', 'desperate', 'measures', 'free', 'doing', 'desperate', 'things', 'visions', 'Therese', 'not', 'necessarily', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'husband', 'families', 'However', 'see', 'how', 'imprisoned', 'times', 'narrow', 'choices', 'women', 'location', 'never', 'discuss', 'feelings', 'Therese', 'admits', 'Jean', 'discuss', 'hunting', 'weather.I', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'film', 'listen', 'French', 'watch', 'Mme', 'Tatou', 'lips', 'are', 'pursed', 'most', 'time', 'expression', 'vacant', 'look', 'French', 'decor', 'homes', 'families', 'are', 'exquisite', 'kept', 'wishing', 'characters', 'would', 'move', 'so', 'could', 'see', 'decor', 'However', 'depressing', 'film', 'Tatou', 'none', 'familiar', 'sparkle', 'been', 'stamped', 'out', 'depression', 'repression', 'film', ""n't"", 'resolve', 'much', 'Therese', 'desires', 'are', 'so', 'ill-formed', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'apparently', 'been', 'stuck', 'French', 'countryside', 'life', 'How', 'can', 'dream', 'something', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'character', 'grandmothers', 'generation', 'born', 'turn', '20th', 'century', 'interesting', 'compare', 'life', 'theirs.The', 'movie', 'advances', 'slowly', 'characters', 'desperation', 'are', 'caught', 'circumstances', 'like', 'dark', 'slow', 'moving', 'films', 'examine', 'circumstances', 'emotions', 'may', 'love', 'film', 'prefer', 'something', 'more', 'buoyant', 'end', 'film', 'Therese', 'circumstances', 'have', 'improved', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'enough', 'be', 'satisfied', 'husband', 'boor', 'still', 'living', 'beck', 'call', 'propriety', 'being', 'good', 'old', 'boy', 'one', 'generation', 'film', 'successful', 'capturing', 'emptiness', 'opportunity', 'feeling', 'lives', 'are', 'lived', 'convention', 'not', 'choice', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'Franois', 'Mauriac']",Therese
