880956,A3UT41TWD7N0D5,B0007IO6PA,AbeStreet,"[8, 8]","I can honestly say that I have never seen another show or sitcom quite like this one.  Bob Newhart has that soft spoken and subtle humor, similar to other great comedians like Jack Benny.  He doesn't need to use slap stick to get you laughing.  Whoever had the idea of centering the show around a mild mannered psychologist, his patients, his friends and his family was a genius!  The ensemble cast was just great.  After a few shows you really begin to like Jerry the Dentist, Carol the Secretary, Howard the Neighbor, and of course Emily the Wife.  The chemistry between Emily (Suzanne Pleshette) and Bob (Bob Newhart) was so good it almost seemed as though they were married for real.  They argued, bickered and had misunderstandings just like normal couples do.  Still the affection and love they had for eachother always came through. I have to admit that as a kid I used to think that if plain old Bob could end up with an attractive and nice lady like Emily than there was hope for me.I should also mention how fun Bob's patients were.  I'm sure most psychologists don't have such loveable patients.  I'm sure most psychologists don't have their patients over to their home for Christmas either.  Still these were some of the nice things about the show.  Bob was just a nice guy.  If I ever need therapy I hope to get a shrink like Bob. Bob always seems to be on the job.  He's usually tyring to sort out the emotional troubles of friends, family, co-workers and patients in each show.There are no DVD extras but that's not a surprise considering how the first season release of THE MARY TYLER MOORE show turned out.  They pulled all the stops out for that release, interviews and commentaries.  The initial release price was over $40 and I guess not as many people purchased it as the studio thought would.  The elevated price turned off prospective purchasers.  So now, as with THE BOB NEWHART SHOW, the sudios release the DVD's with no extras but the price is under $30.  I hope that strategy does the trick because I can't wait for the remaining three seasons to be released.",5,A one of a kind show.,1117756800,"06 3, 2005",2005,2086,"['can', 'honestly', 'say', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'sitcom', 'quite', 'one', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'soft', 'spoken', 'subtle', 'humor', 'similar', 'other', 'great', 'comedians', 'Jack', 'Benny', ""n't"", 'need', 'use', 'slap', 'stick', 'get', 'laughing', 'had', 'idea', 'centering', 'show', 'mild', 'mannered', 'psychologist', 'patients', 'friends', 'family', 'was', 'genius', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'was', 'just', 'great', 'few', 'shows', 'really', 'begin', 'like', 'Jerry', 'Dentist', 'Carol', 'Secretary', 'Howard', 'Neighbor', 'course', 'Emily', 'Wife', 'chemistry', 'Emily', 'Suzanne', 'Pleshette', 'Bob', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'almost', 'seemed', 'were', 'married', 'real', 'argued', 'bickered', 'had', 'misunderstandings', 'just', 'normal', 'couples', 'do', 'Still', 'affection', 'love', 'had', 'eachother', 'always', 'came', 'have', 'admit', 'kid', 'used', 'think', 'plain', 'old', 'Bob', 'could', 'end', 'up', 'attractive', 'nice', 'lady', 'Emily', 'was', 'hope', 'me.I', 'should', 'also', 'mention', 'how', 'fun', 'Bob', 'patients', 'were', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'psychologists', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'such', 'loveable', 'patients', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'psychologists', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'patients', 'home', 'Christmas', 'Still', 'were', 'nice', 'things', 'show', 'Bob', 'was', 'just', 'nice', 'guy', 'ever', 'need', 'therapy', 'hope', 'get', 'shrink', 'Bob', 'Bob', 'always', 'be', 'job', 'usually', 'tyring', 'sort', 'out', 'emotional', 'troubles', 'friends', 'family', 'co-workers', 'patients', 'are', 'DVD', 'extras', 'not', 'surprise', 'considering', 'how', 'first', 'season', 'release', 'THE', 'MARY', 'TYLER', 'MOORE', 'show', 'turned', 'out', 'pulled', 'stops', 'out', 'release', 'interviews', 'commentaries', 'initial', 'release', 'price', 'was', '40', 'guess', 'not', 'many', 'people', 'purchased', 'studio', 'thought', 'would', 'elevated', 'price', 'turned', 'off', 'prospective', 'purchasers', 'So', 'now', 'THE', 'BOB', 'NEWHART', 'SHOW', 'sudios', 'release', 'DVD', 'extras', 'price', '30', 'hope', 'strategy', 'trick', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'remaining', 'three', 'seasons', 'be', 'released']",The Bob Newhart Show: The Complete First Season

It's probably not fair to fault the perfectly-annoying character Kirk, the maid Leslie, or even Joanna. In the early going the writers struggled to come up with funny material for them. They did, at least, come through with funny stuff for Larry, Darryl and Darryl whenever they showed up. (Not very often, unfortunately, in season one.)

880959,A1A4R6PU3QYVJ5,B0007IO6PA,"Amazon Customer ""Serious Reader""","[2, 2]","Bob Newhart was four years removed from his first CBS sitcom when he stepped into this one, which finds him playing a how-to book writer who decides to have a go at running a rustic Vermont inn.  He and his wife, Joanna (played by the gorgeous and talent Mary Frann), deal with the normal run of tourists and locals as they get adjusted to their new life.  That includes Tom Poston, a good friend of Newhart's who played the inn's caretaker, George Utley; Steven Kampmann, who wrote for another CBS sitcom, ""WKRP in Cincinnati"", as the pathological owner of the Minuteman Cafe, Kirk Devane; and Jennifer Holmes, who played student and skier Leslie Vanderkellen.  Along the way, a number of other stars make appearances, including Howard Dodson (Jack Sprague from ""Andy Griffith""), Rue McClanahan (Blanche Devereaux from ""The Golden Girls""), Daniel J. Travanti (Captain Frank Furillo from ""Hill Street Blues"") and Julia Duffy (who appears in one episode at Leslie's cousin, Stephanie, and plays the character much differently than how she defined the role in later seasons).The first season of ""Newhart"" was shot on live-look videotape, like many other sitcoms of the era (including ""The Cosby Show"" and ""Kate & Allie"").  Later seasons were shot on film and on videotape processed to look like film.  But that's part of the charm of the show, as is the fact that you can actually see the actors shaping and molding their characters in each episode.  They're not yet ""set"" into a predictable pattern.  They're growing as you watch.  The acting is very good, but I'm inclined to agree with other posters that it does get better as the seasons progress - especially as Stephanie and the brothers Larry, Darryl and Darryl (William Sanderson, Tony Papenfuss and John Volstad) - become integral characters.Regardless of whether 20th Century-Fox, the company that owns the MTM library, releases additional seasons, if you're a fan of the show or a fan of Bob Newhart, you really owe it to yourself to pick up the first season of ""Newhart"".",4,"The first season of ""Newhart"" is a gem...",1297987200,"02 18, 2011",2011,2031,"['Bob', 'Newhart', 'was', 'four', 'years', 'removed', 'first', 'CBS', 'sitcom', 'when', 'stepped', 'one', 'playing', 'how-to', 'book', 'writer', 'who', 'have', 'go', 'running', 'rustic', 'Vermont', 'inn', 'wife', 'Joanna', 'played', 'gorgeous', 'talent', 'Mary', 'Frann', 'deal', 'normal', 'run', 'tourists', 'locals', 'get', 'adjusted', 'new', 'life', 'Tom', 'Poston', 'good', 'friend', 'Newhart', 'who', 'played', 'inn', 'caretaker', 'George', 'Utley', 'Steven', 'Kampmann', 'who', 'wrote', 'CBS', 'sitcom', 'WKRP', 'Cincinnati', 'pathological', 'owner', 'Minuteman', 'Cafe', 'Kirk', 'Devane', 'Jennifer', 'Holmes', 'who', 'played', 'student', 'skier', 'Leslie', 'Vanderkellen', 'way', 'number', 'other', 'stars', 'make', 'appearances', 'including', 'Howard', 'Dodson', 'Jack', 'Sprague', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Rue', 'McClanahan', 'Blanche', 'Devereaux', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'Daniel', 'J.', 'Travanti', 'Captain', 'Frank', 'Furillo', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'Julia', 'Duffy', 'who', 'one', 'episode', 'Leslie', 'cousin', 'Stephanie', 'character', 'much', 'differently', 'how', 'defined', 'role', 'later', 'seasons', '.The', 'first', 'season', 'Newhart', 'was', 'shot', 'live-look', 'videotape', 'many', 'other', 'sitcoms', 'era', 'including', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'Kate', 'Allie', 'Later', 'seasons', 'were', 'shot', 'film', 'videotape', 'processed', 'look', 'film', 'part', 'charm', 'show', 'fact', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'actors', 'shaping', 'molding', 'characters', 'episode', ""'re"", 'not', 'yet', 'set', 'predictable', 'pattern', ""'re"", 'growing', 'watch', 'acting', 'very', 'good', ""'m"", 'inclined', 'agree', 'other', 'posters', 'get', 'better', 'seasons', 'progress', 'especially', 'Stephanie', 'brothers', 'Larry', 'Darryl', 'Darryl', 'William', 'Sanderson', 'Tony', 'Papenfuss', 'John', 'Volstad', 'become', 'integral', 'characters.Regardless', '20th', 'Century-Fox', 'company', 'MTM', 'library', 'additional', 'seasons', ""'re"", 'fan', 'show', 'fan', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'really', 'owe', 'pick', 'up', 'first', 'season', 'Newhart']",The Bob Newhart Show: The Complete First Season

I didn't care for Stephanie who replaced her cousin in the first season b/c she was shallow and would have gotten along with the Steven Kampmann in the first season--they were so much alike. It's a shame that the producers didn't keep Leslie on throughout Newhart years along with the rest of the cast, excluding of course, Kampmann's part.

It's biggest problem in the first season was using a character named Kirk.  Ultimately you were supposed to like him but that never happened.  He was given too many problems and also was not funny.  Bob Newhart was great, of course.  We got George the Handyman and then Larry and the Darryls showed up (as very minor characters).  Michael, Stephanie, the tv show, etc., were all to come in future seasons.  The last season is as weak as this first one with the golden shows being the ones inbetween.Any Bob Newhart is better than no Bob Newhart though.  Bob is great on the show from episode one to the end.  He never disappoints.  I am a big fan of his.  If you are too, then you can't go wrong. He plays an Innkeeper in Vermont with his wife JoAnna.  They slowly are assimilated into a New England town of characters. Newhart is everyone's comic foil.  He and Poston worked together in his prior series so they are an old ""couple"" at this point and gel from the start.  His wife is good, not as good as Suzanne Pleshette was in his earlier show but she does ok.  Newhart also writes do-it-yourself books and he is quite comedic about these as well.I would say the creators probably saw John Cleese's FAWLTY TOWERS before doing this show.  However, Newhart is a very different comedian than Cleese so it had to be tailored to suit him.

880980,AWLFVCT9128JV,B0007IO6PA,"Dave_42 ""Dave_42""","[42, 43]","Long before today's stand-up comics started to get their own series, Bob Newhart made the move from being a stand-up comic to the main character of his own situation comedy. His success as a stand-up comedian had led to his hosting a variety show in 1961, but hosting a show is not the same as acting and this show from the 1970s led the way to so many comedians making the move. As with all his series, the success of ""The Bob Newhart Show"" comes from the ensemble and the writing.The first season (1972-1973) is a bit uneven at the start, but the creators and writers tweaked it a bit to get the right feel and by the end of the first season the show had really hit its stride. The difference between the pilot episode and shows like ""The Man with the Golden Wrist"", ""Not with my Sister you don't"", and ""Bum Voyage"" is tremendous. So if you think the show isn't as good as you remembered it when you are watching the shows from the first third of the season, don't worry too much, because it keeps getting better, and the last third of the season is very funny.There are no extras in this DVD set. There are 24 episodes on 3 DVDs each of which has 4 episodes per side. There are no actor profiles, features, interviews, or anything like that. The sound is mono, and they probably could have done a better job of cleaning up the video. However, despite these issues this is definitely a funny show and for those who like comedy with more thought and less slapstick, this is for you.

880983,A1FDW1SPYKB354,B0007IO6PA,David Von Pein,"[13, 15]","I hadn't seen any episodes of ""The Bob Newhart Show"" in a number of years prior to purchasing this very nice set of DVDs that has been marketed by Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment.I had almost forgotten how good this sitcom was (and still is). It's been fun being able to see these episodes again, and in uncut form, on DVD. Bob Newhart's dry humor and deadpan style create many jocular moments during this 24-episode rookie season of Bob's self-titled CBS television series (which aired during the 1972-1973 TV season). And those one-man telephone conversations that Bob is known for are always good for some chuckles too. There are usually at least two or three of those in each episode.""The Bob Newhart Show"" began its 6-year, 142-episode-long network-television lifespan on Saturday evening, September 16, 1972, when the first episode (""Fly The Unfriendly Skies"") aired on the Columbia Broadcasting System. When looking back on the impeccable Saturday-night television line-up that CBS possessed in the early 1970s, my mouth pops open with amazement at how good that roster of shows was. As an example, Saturday nights on CBS during the 1973-1974 TV campaign (which was the second season of Newhart's series) featured the following impressive parade of programs:8:00 PM -- ""All In The Family""8:30 PM -- ""M*A*S*H""9:00 PM -- ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show""9:30 PM -- ""The Bob Newhart Show""10:00 PM -- ""The Carol Burnett Show""No wonder Saturdays were big for CBS during that era. What a fabulous line-up indeed. Prior to confirming the above CBS prime-time program schedule, I had thought that the long-running ""M*A*S*H"" had always been part of the Saturday-night schedule. But, in fact, it was only during that one season (1973-1974) that the show appeared on Saturdays. For the remainder of its prime-time run, ""M*A*S*H"" aired on either Sundays, Tuesdays, or Fridays.During Bob Newhart's very first season ('72-'73), the CBS Saturday lineup featured three-fifths of the same programming as the '73-'74 season, with the differences in the schedule being ""Bridget Loves Bernie"" (at 8:30 PM) and ""Mission: Impossible"" in the 10:00 time slot.There's nothing overly fancy about this 3-Disc Bob Newhart DVD boxed set from 20th Century Fox, but it certainly gets the job done very nicely anyway (in a low-key, no-frills manner).These early-'70s episodes look just fine through my orbs. I have no complaints about these DVD transfers at all. This TV show was photographed on film and in color; and the colors look pretty good and natural on the DVDs. Perhaps each show isn't absolutely blemish-free, but still very nice overall.Even if these DVD prints were glazed over with a coating of sand and shrouded in fog, I'd probably still enjoy watching them, because of the singular on-screen presence of one Suzanne Pleshette. Suzanne, who was age 35 and 36 when these episodes first aired in '72 and '73 (and she's looking mahhhh-velous!), has that certain 'something' that I've always enjoyed watching. I love her in everything she's done -- from her excellent dramatic roles in the 1960s TV series ""The Fugitive"", to her first-rate portrayal of an ill-fated schoolteacher in Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" in 1963, to her part as the smart, funny, and always-feisty ""Emily Hartley"" on ""The Bob Newhart Show"".I should also mention Suzanne's appearance opposite Michael Rennie's ""Harry Lime"" in an episode of the TV series ""The Third Man"". That episode in question, called ""Listen For The Sound Of A Witch"", was filmed in 1959. A darn good ep. too, featuring a stunning 22-year-old brunette actress named ""Suzanne"".Suzanne Trivia ..... Did you know that Suzanne Pleshette very nearly became ""Catwoman"" in the ""Batman"" TV series of the 1960s? (I'd have loved her in that show, I'm sure....and in that ""Cat"" outfit, too.) ~wink~This Bob Newhart DVD collection comes packed in a fairly-rugged cardboard box, which comfortably holds two slim-style plastic cases. The trim disc-holding cases that were included with the DVD set that I received from Amazon are black in color (there's no need for the clear, transparent ones here, since there's no text or artwork on the reverse side of the removable paper inserts that wrap around the cases). The first two double-sided discs fit inside the first case, while Disc 3 goes solo into the other one. A brief episode description for each of the shows, plus original CBS air dates, can be found on the back side of each of the two plastic cases.There are no DVD bonus items included here, unless you want to count a foreign-language soundtrack and subtitling as ""bonus"" material. This set does indeed have a non-English audio option -- there's a Spanish Dolby Digital track available for each episode (of the 2-channel Mono variety; I enjoy hearing the voice of the very beautiful Suzanne Pleshette being dubbed in Spanish), in addition to the very adequate English DD 2.0 Mono audio. Both English and Spanish subtitles can be toggled on and off as well. Video, as you would expect, comes in the native Full-Frame TV ratio of 1.33:1.The non-animated DVD Menus employed for this first-season Bob Newhart set are simplistic and will quickly get you to where you want to be. The episodes are divided up into several individual chapters (9 chapter breaks per show, with a ""Scene Selection"" Menu option available for all episodes), with a chapter stop inserted immediately after the opening titles, which is always a good idea in my opinion.Fox's ""The Bob Newhart Show: The Complete Second Season"" 3-Disc DVD collection is pretty much identical in layout and style to this first-season product, and is also energetically recommended by this reviewer. Any Bob Newhart buff will want to collect all seasons of ""Dr. Hartley's"" series.Plus, these seasonal boxed sets of ""The Bob Newhart Show"" look right at home on the ever-growing ""TV-on-DVD"" shelf, especially when nestled right up against all of the excellent full-season DVD collections of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"". Those two first-class sitcoms, which both fall under the ""MTM Enterprises"" umbrella, are required viewing for any self-respecting devotee of top-notch 1970s-era television programming.",5,"""Hi Bob"" ...

In the case of Newhart (and also of Barney Miller), the first season is not as good as the subsequent seasons.  This is primarily because of the first season cast. Jennifer Holmes, as Leslie Vanderkellen, student/maid, is pretty & charming & sweet.  And also forgettable.  When Julia Duffy, as her sassy, conceited cousin Stephanie Vanderkellen, joins the cast, she brings a sparkle and a spice to the show that Jennifer just couldn't achieve.Steven Kampmann is attractive but the character of Kirk is not well written.  He does grow on me as the season progresses, and I will probably miss him when he leaves at the end of season 2, but he's not Peter Scolari.And of course there's very little of Larry, his brother Daryl, and his other brother Daryl in season 1--only 2 appearances.  As I watched these shows, I kept wondering where they were.The writing has always been good, and the performances by Bob Newhart, Mary Frann, and Tom Poston were right on target.

I like the feel of the later filming technique.

He was far too overbearing in my opinion. Although Leslie gets replaced by her far funnier and eccentric cousin later on, she was good.

His telephone conversations where you only hear his side are classics of the genre.  The problem is that the cast around him and the writing are not up to the standards of my favorite series such as ""The Odd Couple"", ""Barney Miller"" and ""Taxi"".  Actually, Taxi and Bob Newhart parallel each other, except that Taxi has a working class venue whereas that of Newhart is upper-middle class.  However, as much as Bob is superior to Judd Hirsch as a comedy actor, the supporting cast of Taxi was much better.  At least in the first season, Bob's psychology patients had pleny of potential for major laughs, especially Mr Elliot Carlin (played by the even more deadpanJack Riley), they just weren't utilised.  Instead we are given endless stories about the unfulfilled love lives of Jerry and Carol which gets stale after awhile.  I also find Suzanne Pleshette as Bob's wife Emily to be very bland and not a good spouse for Bob to play off (someone more neurotic would have been funnier).One thing I observed by wathing all the episodes is the fact that Bob has a noticeable stutter! Either this is done on purpose for the role, otherwise I am surprised it didn't hurt his career.In spite of my criticism, the show is entertaining.

Why is it FOX can't finish releasing The Bob Newhart Show on DVD, ( I KNOW I KNOW they say poor sales), but - What makes them think that Newhart will out sale it by that much more in numbers? I realize Newhart may be considered more popular but I have a VERY BAD feeling FOX will release a few seasons of this show also and back off just like they did to Mary Tyler Moore and The Bob Newhart Show and Hill Street Blues. I will buy this first Season of Newhart but I know deep down FOX will use fans and then abuse us by not finishing what they start. I type these words now, I hope I can eat them later.

The show took most of the first season to find its footing before becoming a mainstay on television. Bob's dry humor contrasted sharply to his zany supporting cast.  In these episodes, Bob shuffled through many ""patients"" before settling on a steady group that would predominate in later seasons, with Carlin emerging as the most memorable.  These episodes also show the domestic side of Bob with some funny but also very true-to-life situations between he and Emily.  Their argument over Monday Night Football being the most memorable.

881002,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B0007IO6PA,James Hiller,"[6, 7]","The Bob Newhart Show is a piece of the wonderful puzzle of early 70's sitcoms that made the time a wonderfully laughing matter. From Mary Richard's time spent at WGM, to Felix and Oscar's stint as roommates, the Bob Newhart Show fit in like a kid glove. We spent many a 1/2 hour watching Bob walk home from the office to his beloved Emily (according to Newhart, the craziest walk home ever, based on Chicago geography).Bob Newhart brings his unique stlye of comedy to television in this show. Bob plays a psychologist with a crazy set of co-workers, and an equally crazy set of neighbors at home. Bob is the brilliant center of the show, intelligent, but not afraid to be the end of jokes that work well in the show. His wife Emily is a schoolteacher, however, through the season she appears to change jobs from substitute to school board worker. Often, whatever her job is depends on the needs of her in that episode's plot.  Wacky neighbor Howard Borden is set up early on as being somewhat not there. In the office, Bob's best friend is Jerry, a definitely 70's singles man who is a brillliant counterpart to the office secretary, Carol.This collection is sadly without any extras. Since all of the actors who starred in the show are still alive, it's amazing to me there isn't any bonus features. It almost seems as if this collection was rushed to the stores to sell, as the quality isn't as high as other DVD TV show collections (I Love Lucy setting a very high standard).Still, the negatives don't detract from the wonderful enjoyment of this show. The laughs are hearty. Watching this, I'm drawn back to my childhood, and the nights I spent watching Bob and Emily puzzle out their life problems, and the problems of their friends, in Chicago. And the result is an enjoyable ride indeed.",5,Bob's Been Calling You,1114473600,"04 26, 2005",2005,1794,"['Bob', 'Newhart', 'Show', 'piece', 'wonderful', 'puzzle', 'early', '70', 'sitcoms', 'made', 'time', 'wonderfully', 'laughing', 'matter', 'Mary', 'Richard', 'time', 'spent', 'WGM', 'Felix', 'Oscar', 'stint', 'roommates', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'Show', 'fit', 'kid', 'glove', 'spent', 'many', '1/2', 'hour', 'watching', 'Bob', 'walk', 'home', 'office', 'beloved', 'Emily', 'according', 'Newhart', 'craziest', 'walk', 'home', 'ever', 'based', 'Chicago', 'geography', 'Newhart', 'unique', 'stlye', 'comedy', 'television', 'show', 'Bob', 'psychologist', 'crazy', 'set', 'co-workers', 'equally', 'crazy', 'set', 'neighbors', 'home', 'Bob', 'brilliant', 'center', 'show', 'intelligent', 'not', 'afraid', 'be', 'end', 'jokes', 'work', 'well', 'show', 'wife', 'Emily', 'schoolteacher', 'however', 'season', 'change', 'jobs', 'substitute', 'school', 'board', 'worker', 'Often', 'job', 'needs', 'episode', 'plot', 'Wacky', 'neighbor', 'Howard', 'Borden', 'set', 'up', 'early', 'being', 'somewhat', 'not', 'there', 'office', 'Bob', 'best', 'friend', 'Jerry', 'definitely', '70', 'singles', 'man', 'who', 'brillliant', 'counterpart', 'office', 'secretary', 'Carol.This', 'collection', 'sadly', 'extras', 'actors', 'who', 'starred', 'show', 'are', 'still', 'alive', 'amazing', ""n't"", 'bonus', 'features', 'almost', 'collection', 'was', 'rushed', 'stores', 'sell', 'quality', ""n't"", 'as', 'high', 'other', 'DVD', 'TV', 'show', 'collections', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'setting', 'very', 'high', 'standard', '.Still', 'negatives', 'do', ""n't"", 'detract', 'wonderful', 'enjoyment', 'show', 'laughs', 'are', 'hearty', 'Watching', ""'m"", 'drawn', 'back', 'childhood', 'nights', 'spent', 'watching', 'Bob', 'Emily', 'puzzle', 'out', 'life', 'problems', 'problems', 'friends', 'Chicago', 'result', 'enjoyable', 'ride', 'indeed']",The Bob Newhart Show: The Complete First Season

I was young and I had never seen a rail train before like that one in the music intro of this tv series. I lived in a small town. I like the theme music which is called ""Home To Emily"".This tv series was intriguing.  It showed what I thought at the time was how married people are and how they lived.  This was a tv comedy series with a good middle-age cast and ""Bob"" and ""Emily"" never had children of their own. Moosie Drier would come to visit. The writing was superb and intellectual.  You won't hear ghetto insults and curse words here.The formula for this tv series worked and unfortunatly today they just do not make tv comedy with middle-age people anymore and that is a real shame.  It is truly the middle-age and seniors that enjoy watching prime-time television, which is why TV LAND network is such a hit.If I may say so, I always thought theThe Mary Tyler Moore Show - The Complete First Season(1970-77) was a good companion tv show with The Bob Newhart Show (1972-78) andRhoda: Season One(1974-78) too.  Together they made a great tv line-up on CBS.Bob Newhart played ""Dr. Robert Hartley"", a psychologist who is married to a well-educated proper woman, ""Emily"" (Suzanne Pleshette). Bob has a new lobby secretary, ""Carol"" (Marcia Wallace) whom at first seems to be a bubble-head, but really becomes an efficent secretary that Bob can not do without.  Carol is also the secretary for the orthodontist, ""Jerry"" (Peter Bonerz).Poor Bob.  You never know what Bob has to deal with every morning at work.  It's either the elevator or he has to deal with a fill-in secretary while Carol is away. In any case, Bob certainly needs his morning coffee.By the way, Bob has a neighbor (Bill Daily) that looks just like the person we know onI Dream of Jeannie: The Complete First Season(1965-70).The rarly-seen pilot episode (the test episode for networks for possible tv series) is really neat-o to see.  The living room is slightly different.  The bedroom decor is different.  The new neighbor is different.  William Redfield played a neighbor, ""Arthur Hoover"", in the test pilot episode. Patricia Smith played his wife, ""Margaret Hoover"" and continued the role to 1973.  William Redfield only made one more appearance, as a different character in the Fourth Season, Episode 18.In the first season, you might recognize the faces of: M. Emmet Walsh, Helen Page Camp, Ron Masak, Jack Riley, Louise Lasser, Elaine Giftos, Bernie Kopell, Archie Kahn, Marilyn Child, Pat Morita, James Hong, King Moody, Florida Friebus, Renee Lippin, Chuck McCann, Joyce Van Patten, Allen Garfield, Noam Pitlik, Penny Marshall, Larry Gelman, Peter Brown, Martha Scott, Penny Fuller, Dick Schaal, James B.

Rowe and Pat McCormick.All 24 episodes of the first season are here, but don't forget to turn over each disc for more episodes.The ""Bob Newhart Show"" lasted for 7 seasons.The bedroom set kept changing during the first season and the apartment door and apartment numbers would change.Where on earth did the set designer get those horrible paintings from...Night Gallery - The Complete First Season? Just a joke.This DVD set was brought to you by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment and MTM Enterprises, Inc.During Bob Newhart's second hit tv series, ""Newhart"", their was a ""surprise"" scene in the last episode of ""Newhart"" that aired, May 21, 1990.The entire cast reunited for ""The Bob Newhart Show--19th Anniversary Special"", broadcast November 23, 1991.Marcia Wallace as ""Carol"" appeared on the ""Murphy Brown"" tv series, March 14, 1994, with a surprise appearance by Bob Newhart as ""Bob Hartley"".On NBC Saturday Night Live, February 11, 1995, Bob Newhart and Suzanne Pleshette reunited in as Bob & Emily.The cast also reunited for an episode in another Bob Newhart tv series, ""George & Leo"" that aired, November 3, 1997.""CBS at 75"", November 2003.

We then see him repeatedly going back and forth across the north branch of the Chicago River.  Which leads any reviewer to speculate on the causes for this:1.  Did he find Emily (Suzanne Pleshette) too hard to take, and was debating whether to go home or not?2.  Did Bob have undiagnosed ADHD?3.

It's a start and you can see as it goes on the characters developing.  I'm almost halfway through and I can see Suzanne's character change to what we all remember her as, so savvy, not the typical housewife.  One thing I do notice, the interaction and admiration between the husband and wife.  As far as the other characters I am not too impressed, you see too much of the airline navigator/neighbor stopping by too much and too much of Jerry Robinson, the Dentist.

The original Bob Newhart Show was a superbly written and wonderfully casted classic and Newhart is no exception.  Bob's classic timing and dead-pan stares are unbelievably funny.

Despite an enormous outpouring of demands for the final seasons of The Bob Newhart Show--it is yet to be released.

TV Land seemed to be playing Musical Bobs by repeatedly putting it on the schedule for a few weeks -- always in the early morning hours -- only to quickly yank it off the air again.  Lather.  Rinse.  Repeat.  Still, I was surprised to find how many times I laughed out loud while watching the episodes in this first season.  And this wasn't even Bob's best season!  The show was still finding its footing at this point, but it's still hilarious.The show itself is definitely worthy of five stars, but since there doesn't seem to have been any restoration work done (the video and audio quality is mediocre at best), the rating is brought down to four stars (I would make it 4 1/2 if that were an option).  However, the fact that very little money was spent putting these episodes on DVD is what enables us to buy the entire first season for such a terrific price.  Compare the price of this set to the first season set of The Mary Tyler Moore Show.  That one came out a few years ago, beautifully restored and chockful of extras, but with an MSRP of fifty bucks!  No wonder they didn't sell all that many (though I was one of the few who happily purchased the set, being a longtime devotee of the show).  Additional seasons were promised, but guess what?  So few sets were sold that they cancelled any further releases of MTM.  If keeping the Bob Newhart Show down to the bare bones enables them to release all of the seasons at a terrific price, it's okay with me.The Bottom Line: An hilarious show, uncut for the first time since it went into syndicated reruns, for a fantastic price.

881023,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B0007IO6PA,Mark Baker,"[17, 18]","In 1982, Bob Newhart returned to TV with his second sitcom.  In my mind, this show is even better then his first, although it got off to a slow start.Dick Loudon (Bob Newhart) is the author of multiple how to books and travel guides.  He's always dreamed of restoring an inn.  Together with his wife Joanna (Mary Frann), he decides now is the time.  So they buy the Stratford Inn in Vermont and go about restoring it and turning it into a bed and breakfast.  Along with the inn, they get caretaker George Utley (Tom Poston).  George is a bit dim and simple, but he's truly a lovable guy.  They also hire Leslie Vanderkellen (Jennifer Holmes) as their maid.  Unfortunately, their next door neighbor latches on to them as well.  Kirk Devane (Steven Kampmann) runs the Minutemen Cafe and has the bad habit of lying about everything.Now those familiar with the show are probably already scratching their heads at some of the cast.  The show was still finding itself in the first couple of seasons, so the characters everyone associates with this sitcom aren't all here yet.  Larry, Darryl, and Darryl do show up for two guest shots (and they are both great) and Leslie's cousin Stephanie (Julia Duffy) does show up for one episode as well.  She's not quite the stuck up snob we'd love starting next season, but it's not a big stretch to see it in her personality.I can see why the two characters that were replaced were replaced.  It has nothing to do with the actors, everyone on the show is great.  But Kirk gets old in a hurry.  And Leslie, while a wonderful character, isn't that funny.Having said that, there are some truly great moments here.  The Loudons try to deal with a skeleton in their basement.  Dick is disappointed when he can't get the inn declared a historical landmark.  He has to delicately tell a group of women what their ancestors found when they stayed there during the Revolutionary War (hint, it wasn't a place of good repute).  George meets up with his old girlfriend.  A crowded Christmas gets even worse when a pregnant woman arrives about to give birth.  And Kirk's lies come back to haunt him when his cafe is robbed.There are three bonus featurettes, two really short, but ""Getting to the Heart of Newhart"" is about 18 minutes and includes interviews with Bob, Julia, and several of the other actors.  The box lists a fourth, but it is no where to be found on the discs.While the best was still definitely to come from this classic sitcom, there is still plenty here to please fans.

Suddenly, Suzanne Pleshette has a different hairstyle, the Hartleys have a different nosy neighbor, the wallpaper in their apartment is different, Emily's friend Margaret is pregnant, and the Hartleys are obsessed with having a baby.  After this episode, everything goes back to the way it was with the same cast and no mention of the Hartleys trying to become parents.  Toward the end of the season, the show had found its groove and it would really hit its stride in the second season. Overall, this DVD set is worth your time and money.  It's not the best season of the show, but it will definitely keep you entertained.",4,A nice start for a classic sitcom,1168387200,"01 10, 2007",2007,1058,"['was', 'very', 'happy', 'when', 'saw', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'sitcoms', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'Show', 'was', 'finally', 'being', 'released', 'DVD', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'most', 'first', 'seasons', 'shows', 'lot', 'time', 'showing', 'quirks', 'mannerisms', 'main', 'characters', 'show', 'most', 'prevalent', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'One', 'drawback', 'season', 'was', 'nowhere', 'pilot', 'was', 'thrown', 'ninth', 'episode', 'Suddenly', 'Suzanne', 'Pleshette', 'different', 'hairstyle', 'Hartleys', 'have', 'different', 'nosy', 'neighbor', 'wallpaper', 'apartment', 'different', 'Emily', 'friend', 'Margaret', 'pregnant', 'Hartleys', 'are', 'obsessed', 'having', 'baby', 'episode', 'everything', 'back', 'way', 'was', 'same', 'cast', 'mention', 'Hartleys', 'trying', 'become', 'parents', 'end', 'season', 'show', 'had', 'found', 'groove', 'would', 'really', 'hit', 'stride', 'second', 'season', 'Overall', 'DVD', 'set', 'time', 'money', 'not', 'best', 'season', 'show', 'will', 'definitely', 'keep', 'entertained']",The Bob Newhart Show: The Complete First Season

881035,A295OPF6HX7XFP,B0007IO6PA,Oldest & Wisest,"[65, 87]","I am both happy and unhappy to see that the first season of Bob Newhart's second sitcom, ""Newhart"" is going to be released to DVD in February.I am happy because ""Newhart"" was a very good show with a ""fish out of water"" premise about a writer of ""how-to-do it"" books who decides to run a tourist inn in rural Vermont with his wife.  Like a number of other sitcoms, it took it a while to build up a good head of steam and the first season in general is not as funny as those that followed, but for Newhart fans this DVD set will be well worth having.The reason I am also UNhappy is because good as it is, ""Newhart"" was not nearly as good as the first Newhart sitcom, ""The Bob Newhart Show.""  And unfortunately, the release of the first season of ""Newhart"" is an almost sure indicator that Fox will not be releasing the last two seasons of TBNS on DVD.Most of us Newhart fans had already suspected this since it has been well over a year since the release of the 4th season of TBNS.  But there is no way that Fox is going to release sets of TBNS and ""Newhart"" simultaneously as this would reduce the total number of copies sold of the two of them.It is sad that so many DVD manufacturers have begun releasing the first couple of seasons of some of the classic TV series but have stopped short without completing the full series due to poor sales.  (E.g. Green Acres, Dragnet, Emergency, TBNS, Taxi, etc.)Do the DVD producers expect that every series is going to have the same number of sales as something like ""The Simpsons?""  Of course, the older classic TV series are going to have fewer sales, fewer of their fans are still around.  But it seems to me that if you issue the first season of ""Green Acres"", say, on DVD and you only sell 20,000 copies of 25,000 produced, for the second season you simply produce 15,000 copies to insure that you sell them all.  This is not brain surgery, folks!Forgive me.  Getting back to Newhart, if you like a good situation comedy, buy it and pray that Fox release ALL of the seasons.  Can you imagine some episodes of ""Newhart"" being on DVD without the classic final episode, considered by some the greatest final episode in sitcom history, being available as well?",4,Good and Bad News,1196726400,"12 4, 2007",2007,2201,"['am', 'happy', 'unhappy', 'see', 'first', 'season', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'second', 'sitcom', 'Newhart', 'going', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'February.I', 'am', 'happy', 'Newhart', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'fish', 'water', 'premise', 'writer', 'how-to-do', 'books', 'who', 'run', 'tourist', 'inn', 'rural', 'Vermont', 'wife', 'number', 'other', 'sitcoms', 'took', 'while', 'build', 'up', 'good', 'head', 'steam', 'first', 'season', 'general', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'followed', 'Newhart', 'fans', 'DVD', 'set', 'will', 'be', 'well', 'worth', 'having.The', 'reason', 'am', 'also', 'UNhappy', 'because', 'good', 'Newhart', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'Newhart', 'sitcom', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'Show', 'unfortunately', 'release', 'first', 'season', 'Newhart', 'almost', 'sure', 'indicator', 'Fox', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'releasing', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'TBNS', 'DVD.Most', 'Newhart', 'fans', 'had', 'already', 'suspected', 'been', 'well', 'year', 'release', '4th', 'season', 'TBNS', 'way', 'Fox', 'going', 'release', 'sets', 'TBNS', 'Newhart', 'simultaneously', 'would', 'reduce', 'total', 'number', 'copies', 'sold', 'two', 'them.It', 'sad', 'so', 'many', 'DVD', 'manufacturers', 'have', 'begun', 'releasing', 'first', 'couple', 'seasons', 'classic', 'TV', 'series', 'have', 'stopped', 'short', 'completing', 'full', 'series', 'due', 'poor', 'sales', 'E.g', 'Green', 'Acres', 'Dragnet', 'Emergency', 'TBNS', 'Taxi', 'etc', 'Do', 'DVD', 'producers', 'expect', 'series', 'going', 'have', 'same', 'number', 'sales', 'something', 'Simpsons', 'course', 'older', 'classic', 'TV', 'series', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'fewer', 'sales', 'fewer', 'fans', 'are', 'still', 'issue', 'first', 'season', 'Green', 'Acres', 'say', 'DVD', 'only', 'sell', '20,000', 'copies', '25,000', 'produced', 'second', 'season', 'simply', 'produce', '15,000', 'copies', 'insure', 'sell', 'not', 'brain', 'surgery', 'folks', 'Forgive', 'Getting', 'back', 'Newhart', 'like', 'good', 'situation', 'comedy', 'buy', 'pray', 'Fox', 'release', 'ALL', 'seasons', 'Can', 'imagine', 'episodes', 'Newhart', 'being', 'DVD', 'classic', 'final', 'episode', 'considered', 'greatest', 'final', 'episode', 'sitcom', 'history', 'being', 'available', 'as', 'well']",The Bob Newhart Show: The Complete First Season

(Despite the presumptive pilot episode when Bob plays the typicak frantic sitcom husband who really wants a kid). It seems the characters are fully developed - if the set contains shooting dates, I missed it - but unlike so many sitcoms (even the classics like The Honeymooners, Seinfeld, The Odd Couple) which had that rough-around-the-edges exaggeration in the early stages. Jerry and Carol, especially, are right on the money; in fact, Carol is perhaps even funnier and sexier than in later years. Another plus is that Howard, the out of sorts next door neighbor who happens to be an airline pilot (the writers stretched a bit on that deal), has less tod o and that's good. Want a character to slow down the works with a spaced out soliliqy? - that's what we got more and more of as the series progressed but that character never did.We also have the benefit of no ""Bob's sister"", who was omnipresent in later seasons. A very dull and unnecessary addition - the writers apparently thought she'd make a good helpmate for Borden. It was grueling.It's easy to throw in the word ""dated"", but it's really unavoidable, and even some of the best-loved characters, including Mr. Carlin, are just too unbelievable.A highlight of this set is the episode with Chuck McCann, as a noisy co-vacationer, who stays at the adjoining cabine (or room)...no problem sharing the bathroom with Bob and Emily. They're staying at a mountain retreat, with just two other folks, and the four or five staffers who at as waiters, entertainers, social directors, whatever.This set is a good place to start if you are a fan of Bob Newhart...or just far above average '70s sitcoms.",4,The best of seasons 1-3,1250467200,"08 17, 2009",2009,1807,"['Surprising', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'sound', 'little', 'flat.But', 'amazing', 'big', 'point', 'show', 'got', 'off', 'rousing', 'start', 'presumptive', 'pilot', 'episode', 'when', 'Bob', 'typicak', 'frantic', 'sitcom', 'husband', 'who', 'really', 'kid', 'characters', 'are', 'fully', 'developed', 'set', 'shooting', 'dates', 'missed', 'so', 'many', 'sitcoms', 'even', 'classics', 'Honeymooners', 'Seinfeld', 'Odd', 'Couple', 'had', 'rough-around-the-edges', 'exaggeration', 'early', 'stages', 'Jerry', 'Carol', 'especially', 'are', 'right', 'money', 'fact', 'Carol', 'perhaps', 'even', 'funnier', 'sexier', 'later', 'years', 'Howard', 'out', 'sorts', 'door', 'neighbor', 'who', 'be', 'airline', 'pilot', 'writers', 'stretched', 'bit', 'deal', 'less', 'tod', 'o', 'good', 'Want', 'character', 'slow', 'down', 'works', 'spaced', 'soliliqy', 'what', 'got', 'more', 'more', 'series', 'progressed', 'character', 'never', 'did.We', 'also', 'have', 'benefit', 'Bob', 'sister', 'who', 'was', 'omnipresent', 'later', 'seasons', 'very', 'dull', 'unnecessary', 'addition', 'writers', 'apparently', 'thought', ""'d"", 'make', 'good', 'helpmate', 'Borden', 'was', 'grueling.It', 'easy', 'throw', 'word', 'dated', 'really', 'unavoidable', 'even', 'best-loved', 'characters', 'including', 'Mr.', 'Carlin', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'unbelievable.A', 'highlight', 'set', 'episode', 'Chuck', 'McCann', 'noisy', 'co-vacationer', 'who', 'adjoining', 'cabine', 'room', 'problem', 'sharing', 'bathroom', 'Bob', 'Emily', ""'re"", 'staying', 'mountain', 'retreat', 'just', 'two', 'other', 'folks', 'four', 'five', 'staffers', 'who', 'waiters', 'entertainers', 'social', 'directors', 'whatever.This', 'set', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'are', 'fan', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'just', 'far', 'above', 'average', 'sitcoms']",The Bob Newhart Show: The Complete First Season

Mr. Newhart stars as Dick Loudon, an extremely successful author of how-to and travel related books.  Some of the early jokes are of the humorous titles of said books.  Some other classic Newhart bits such as his telephone conversations make there way in and as with ""The Bob Newhart Show"", Dick is the center of calm surrounded by a cast of slightly off-center people.  Mary Frann is solid as Dick's understanding wife Joanna and Tom Poston is hilarious as George the inn's handyman who has a few screws of his own that need tightening.  The first season of the series has a different set up than later seasons with Jennifer Nichols as Leslie Vanderkellen, the rich Dartmouth student who takes a job at the inn as a life experience and Stephen Kampmann as Kirk Devane, the owner of the neighboring Minute Man Cafe who is self-absorbed and a chronic liar.  Julia Duffy who would become a perfect foil for Mr. Newhart in future seasons guests a Stephanie Vanderkellen, Leslie's cousin, in one episode and Larry, Darryl & Darryl appear in a few episodes throughout the season.  Ms. Nichols character was written off the show after these season as it was felt that the character didn't provide the kind of weird personality that Mr. Newhart works so well with and was replaced by Ms. Duffy whose self-absorbed drama queen worked much better.

I'm one of those who has a fondness for the first couple of seasons, when the humour was at its most intelligent and subtle...not unlike Bob himself, come to think of it.  This DVD release is highly anticipated though I share the pessimism of others that Fox will stick with the series. Inevitably, demand for series TV tends to drop off as additional years are released.  Perhaps more distrubutors should take a cue from Time-Life, who released all seasons of Get Smart in a single package, before rolling out individual seasons.

If you haven't seen it recently, now is the time to give it another look and see comedy which was driven by good writing rather than by overused and/or hackneyed sitcom plots. It's also a pleasure to see humor which isn't nasty or negative. The Bob Newhart show is downright ""fresh"" when viewed alongside current comedy fare.As for the complaints about the packaging and lack of extras, one has to consider the *extremely* low price for the season and the experience Fox had with the Mary Tyler Moore show (another classic of the same era). Fox gave the first season of the Mary Tyler Moore show the star treatment and a higher price to cover the cost and it sold poorly. This made them reluctant to even release other classic comedies and the Bob Newhart show may never have seen a DVD release.While I would have liked to have seen an interview with Bob offering some memories of  his experience with the show (or introductions), I think this type of comedy doesn't benefit much from commentary since the humor is in the pacing and the dialog. Talking over the show would seem rather disruptive and pointless. Also, I'm not sure how much anyone could remember from a show that aired so long ago.As for the packaging, I like the slim cases and wish all DVDs were released in them.

Here, Bob's character plays the straight man to everybody else. This show should be shown again as a testament that good comedy does not always have to be about sexuality, superficiality, or bathroom humor. In this series, the cast of characters is treated with the same reverence that should be across the board on television these days.

Now I was still a bit young at the time but through seeing repeats for years I've gained a great appreciation for this show.  So cleverly written, so undeniably witty that it took, I think, a bit more maturity on my part to fully ""get it"".  You start with a great cast.  Toss out Newhart who was always great, and move to the co-stars.  Suzanne Pleshette as bob's wife Emily, a school teacher, Bill Daily as Next door neighbor and Airlines Pilot, Howard, Peter Bonerz as Dr. Jerry Robinson who shared receptionist Carol played by Marcia Wallace.  And then there was Bob's various patients, most notably John Fielder as ""Mr. Peterson"" and Jack Riley as ""Mr. Carlin"".Bob's casual nature in dealing with his nutty patients week after week has always been the highlight for me.  I've always loved shows where you kind of have one normal character surrounded by a cast of looneys and no show ever did it better than this one.  Surprisingly, this show was NEVER a top 10 show.  Incredible really considering it's strong lead-ins with MTM and ""All in the Family"".This set obviously collects the entire first season, all 24 episodes and, If I may say, at one heck of a bargain compared to many other TV shows on DVD.  A few of my favorite episodes from season one are:""His Busiest Season""  It's Christmas and Bob's patients are feeling even more down in the dumps than usual so Bob decides to invite them over for Christmas.""I owe it all to you, But not that much""  Jerry, whose problems with women were a recurring theme, decides to see Bob as a patient to talk about it but soon it threatens their friendship.""Don't go to Bed Mad""  Bob and Emily get into a huge argument when Bob wants to watch Monday Night Football.This show had the kind of witty writing that you just don't see much in sitcoms these days.

The show followed Dr. Robert Hartley, a pyschologist living in Chicago with his wife and substitute schoolteacher, Emily.  We meet Bob's nosy yet lovable neighbor Howard Borden, his best friend Jerry Robinson, an orthadontist who works on the same floor, and Bob's lovesick receptionist, Carol Kester.  Included with the main cast are recurring guest stars like Jack Riley as Mr. Carlin and John Fielder as Mr. Peterson, two of Bob's most hilarious patients.  This ensemble cast provided plenty of hilarious moments, including the ""Hi, Bob,"" drinking game, and it is great to see this show finally on DVD.  This sitcom provided Bob Newhart the perfect opportunity for his dry, sarcastic humor.  As well, almost every show from the first season features one of his famous telephone acts.  For a can't miss 70s sitcom, check out the Bob Newhart show.Bob Newhart is hilarious throughout as Dr. Robert Hartley, a pyschologist living in Chicago with his wife Emily, played by Suzanne Pleshette.  Together, Newhart and Pleshette make a funny and still believable married couple.  Bill Daily as neighbor Howard Borden, Peter Bonerz as orthadontist/best friend Jerry Robinson, and Marcia Wallace as receptionist Carol Kester make up the supporting cast and provide some of the show's most hilarious moments.  The First Season DVD features all 24 episodes in full frame on three discs.  They look cleaned up from some of the ones shown on TV.  There are no extras included on the DVD, but hopefully on future releases bloopers/gag reel or interviews with the cast are included.  For now, we'll just have to enjoy the classic first season of The Bob Newhart Show.

There are a couple of clinkers, but the vast majority of the episodes are very entertaining.  And a few of them are side-splitting.  My favorite is ""The Boy Who Cried Goat,"" which highlights the downside of Kirk's chronic lying, with hilarious results.  Having Kirk take a lie-detector test was a brilliant idea.  Too bad he only lasted two seasons as I thought his character was a scream.  His love interest was Leslie the maid, played by Jennifer Holmes, who didn't seem to contribute much in the way of laughs.  She was, nevertheless, a very likeable personality.  The writers didn't do her any favors, often giving her nondescript lines, a character that wasn't very well defined, and bad clothing.  And they apparently gave up on the love interest plot line with her and Kirk, which made her character irrelevant.Bob Newhart, of course, was superb, along with Mary Fran and Tom Poston.  Even though this season didn't feature much of Larry, Darryl and Darryl, or Stephanie, and no Michael, it is still a very enjoyable DVD set that I highly recommend.  The video and sound quality are both excellent.The special features are short, but interesting.  I noticed that no one from the show who was interviewed made any mention of Steven Kampmann (Kirk) or Jennifer Holmes (Leslie).

Although, you've got to admit a few of gags are standard 70's cornball stuff (many by the neighbor, ""Margret""), but above all else is great writing and timing. Some true standout episodes that won me over totally and prompted a slight change of heart were: Anything Happen While I Was Gone?, His Busiest Season, and Let's Get Away From It Almost.You know a show is good when the star can entertain you merely by talking on a phone (probably) to no one at all. Bob's facial expressions, timing, and body language speak volumes.The transfer is pretty nice, the sound is passable. The packaging seems a bit ""cut rate"" but is servicable I suppose, I've definately seen worse.
