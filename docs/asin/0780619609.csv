But as an adult i realize that it's obvious that they had to lighten up the film for a kid audience, considering how dark the first film was for a kids film. The opening fight scene will tell you what this film is all about. Also the way they explain the ooze is a complete cop out and dumb. The scientist guy is rather annoying, the attempts at humor is also much weaker than the first.No Rockstedy & Bebop, that's another thing, even though i like Toka and Razar. Spoiler alert! Vanilla Ice is in this (I do love the song 'The Ninja Rap'), after the Turtle's accidently discover a dance club in the bad guy's hideout, oh boy.Over all, it's not truly horrible, but i don't enjoy it the same way i did as a kid.",3,Doesn't age well as the first film,1390608000,"01 25, 2014",2014,754,"['First', 'loved', 'movie', 'kid', 'adult', 'i', 'realize', 'obvious', 'had', 'lighten', 'up', 'film', 'kid', 'audience', 'considering', 'how', 'dark', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'kids', 'film', 'opening', 'fight', 'scene', 'will', 'tell', 'what', 'film', 'Also', 'way', 'explain', 'ooze', 'complete', 'cop', 'dumb', 'scientist', 'guy', 'rather', 'annoying', 'attempts', 'humor', 'also', 'much', 'weaker', 'first.No', 'Rockstedy', 'Bebop', 'thing', 'even', 'i', 'Toka', 'Razar', 'Spoiler', 'alert', 'Vanilla', 'Ice', 'do', 'love', 'song', 'Ninja', 'Rap', 'Turtle', 'accidently', 'dance', 'club', 'bad', 'guy', 'hideout', 'oh', 'not', 'truly', 'horrible', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'same', 'way', 'i', 'did', 'kid']",N/A

Ernie Reyes Jr. was on his way to becoming an action star for the younger set with this film, unfortunately, he ran smack into the movie ""Surf Ninjas"" and ruined his film career, but I still saw him years afterward as a judge on beauty contests. What a good kid film can get you into nowadays. Anyway, this film takes the Turtles back into the vague illusion of the genre which was the genesis of this story in the first place, science fiction.  We find more of the glowing ooze and what it does if  consumed by Shredder. Also of great note is the cameo by Vanilla Ice as the club performer.  Although he was never really cool to me I think his cameo in this film is the thing of genius because he's just so odd of a man.  He did have charisma back then and he doesn't now because he lied to us about his being raised in a harsh environment.  In reality, he was so popular back then that he probably wouldn't be playing at a small club, he'd be playing arenas, but that's not as alluring, or immediate as a small basement club that the Turtles happen to crash into while being pursued by the foot squad.  What he ends up rapping isn't great in retrospect, nothing he's ever done, or will do, will ever be that good, but all my friends that went to see it wanted to talk about was that rap, it was simple, dancable, and set to the club atmosphere which I had never experienced before.  Ultimately, the movie is just as odd in an attempt to be more bloodlessly violent, funny, and over the top than the previous film.  What it ends up skipping out on is the human story which makes the first film better, in my opinion. The Turtles are so entertaining because they are more than human, but it's no surprise that they resemble a human scientific genius, hothead,standup comedian, and jock-like captain. It's when the Turtles are in contrast to people that they shine the most and they seem to do less of in this film while still remaining entertaining.",5,"Ahh, my first exposure to the live action turtles",1108166400,"02 12, 2005",2005,2014,"['Great', 'stuff', 'Very', 'funny', 'violent', 'harmless', 'kind', 'way', 'Ernie', 'Reyes', 'Jr.', 'was', 'way', 'becoming', 'action', 'star', 'younger', 'set', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'ran', 'smack', 'movie', 'Surf', 'Ninjas', 'ruined', 'film', 'career', 'still', 'saw', 'years', 'afterward', 'judge', 'beauty', 'contests', 'What', 'good', 'kid', 'film', 'can', 'get', 'nowadays', 'Anyway', 'film', 'Turtles', 'back', 'vague', 'illusion', 'genre', 'was', 'genesis', 'story', 'first', 'place', 'science', 'fiction', 'find', 'more', 'glowing', 'ooze', 'what', 'consumed', 'Shredder', 'Also', 'great', 'note', 'cameo', 'Vanilla', 'Ice', 'club', 'performer', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'cool', 'think', 'cameo', 'film', 'thing', 'genius', 'just', 'so', 'odd', 'man', 'did', 'have', 'charisma', 'back', 'then', ""n't"", 'now', 'lied', 'being', 'raised', 'harsh', 'environment', 'reality', 'was', 'so', 'popular', 'back', 'then', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'playing', 'small', 'club', ""'d"", 'be', 'playing', 'arenas', 'not', 'alluring', 'immediate', 'small', 'basement', 'club', 'Turtles', 'happen', 'crash', 'being', 'pursued', 'foot', 'squad', 'What', 'up', 'rapping', ""n't"", 'great', 'retrospect', 'nothing', 'ever', 'done', 'will', 'do', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'good', 'friends', 'went', 'see', 'wanted', 'talk', 'was', 'rap', 'was', 'simple', 'dancable', 'set', 'club', 'atmosphere', 'had', 'never', 'experienced', 'Ultimately', 'movie', 'just', 'odd', 'attempt', 'be', 'more', 'bloodlessly', 'violent', 'funny', 'top', 'previous', 'film', 'What', 'up', 'skipping', 'out', 'human', 'story', 'first', 'film', 'better', 'opinion', 'Turtles', 'are', 'so', 'entertaining', 'are', 'more', 'human', 'surprise', 'resemble', 'human', 'scientific', 'genius', 'hothead', 'standup', 'comedian', 'jock-like', 'captain', 'when', 'Turtles', 'are', 'contrast', 'people', 'shine', 'most', 'seem', 'do', 'less', 'film', 'still', 'remaining', 'entertaining']",N/A

Their friend, TV reporter April O'Neill (Paige Turco), having presumably been awarded a juicy check from the insurance company after the destruction of her curio shop and apartment by fire, has acquired an apartment and is putting them up till they can find a new headquarters (""The rat is the cleanest one,"" she sighs as she cleans up their mess), and though the Turtles themselves are hyped and cocky, certain that the Foot Clan is crushed and Shredder's nosedive into a garbage truck has removed him from contention, Splinter has his doubts.  And, of course, the wise rat is right, for an intern at April's TV station is in fact a Foot spy.  When a chemical-company scientist (David Warner) is kidnapped from his lab by the Foot, it becomes clear that the mysterious green ooze that originally mutated Splinter and his ""sons"" wasn't the last of its kind--and, what's worse, not only has Shredder survived, but he plans to use it to get revenge.  With the help of a young pizza-delivery boy and martial-arts student (Ernie Reyes, Jr.), the Turtles set out to track him down and learn the truth about their origins.  The saucy humor and wild combat action of the first movie are still around, though it would have been nice to know what became of street vigilante Casey Jones, and the new home the Turtles discover--apparently a forgotten station from the early days of the New York subway system--is a splendid piece of set design.

I bought it, and very eagerly watched it, and while I still love it I am also no longer marred by being a child, the flaws of this movie are simply that its dated now. Michelangelo's comment about &quot;video games in 3D&quot; garnered a chuckle out of me because for over almost a decade now video games have been in 3D.Its kind of weird how this works. As a child I didn't much care for the first Turtles movie, but as an adult suddenly the humor makes sense and I find it to be a very enjoyable flick, in contrast, TMNT 2, which was my favorite as a child of the TMNT trilogy, now seems... well... childish. Its not that this movie is unenjoyable, as its still a fun movie, just don't expect the depth of something like... say X-Men, or Spider-Man, the type of super hero movies I tend to go for now. I think its safe to say that I've out grown the Ninja Turtles. Still, as a Jim Henson fan, I'm still glad I have this movie now, as I am a Henson completist and am trying to get every Henson related film on DVD. I may be single still, but I hope to have a family someday, and it will be great to be able to show these types of movies to my children who will likely find more entertainment value out of this particular installment than I did.Please don't misunderstand the review, its not that I don't like this film, it's just that as an adult, the first movie was a lot better.",3,The test of time...,1034035200,"10 8, 2002",2002,1518,"['ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'give', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'would', 'like', 'been', 'long', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'found', 'Wal-Mart', 'bought', 'very', 'eagerly', 'watched', 'still', 'love', 'am', 'also', 'no', 'longer', 'marred', 'being', 'child', 'flaws', 'movie', 'are', 'simply', 'dated', 'now', 'Michelangelo', 'comment', 'quot', 'video', 'games', '3D', 'quot', 'garnered', 'chuckle', 'almost', 'decade', 'now', 'games', 'have', 'been', '3D.Its', 'kind', 'weird', 'how', 'child', 'did', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'first', 'Turtles', 'movie', 'adult', 'suddenly', 'humor', 'sense', 'find', 'be', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'flick', 'contrast', 'TMNT', '2', 'was', 'favorite', 'child', 'TMNT', 'trilogy', 'now', 'well', 'childish', 'not', 'movie', 'unenjoyable', 'still', 'fun', 'movie', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'depth', 'something', 'say', 'X-Men', 'Spider-Man', 'type', 'super', 'hero', 'movies', 'tend', 'go', 'now', 'think', 'safe', 'say', ""'ve"", 'out', 'grown', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'Still', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'fan', ""'m"", 'still', 'glad', 'have', 'movie', 'now', 'am', 'Henson', 'completist', 'am', 'trying', 'get', 'Henson', 'related', 'film', 'DVD', 'may', 'be', 'single', 'still', 'hope', 'have', 'family', 'someday', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'be', 'able', 'show', 'types', 'movies', 'children', 'who', 'will', 'likely', 'find', 'more', 'entertainment', 'value', 'particular', 'installment', 'did.Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'misunderstand', 'review', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'just', 'that', 'adult', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'lot', 'better']",N/A

This is the only movie i have ever scene get away, and have absolutely no explosives or bombs in the movie, and yet people like the fight scenes. Actors changed on Donatello and Shredder, the new actor for Shredder was impressive, really did have a resemblance to the first shredder. Donatello however, even though the new actor is equally talented in fights scenes, in some ways better then the original actor, he doesn't have that voice fans liked about the original actor, i can't remember any of the actors names playing the turtles. But they are talented, great fight scenes in those heavy costumes.

Then we got the immensely popular 1987 Fred Wolf cartoon which put the Turtles on the map. Then came a series of arcade and video games. Then there were toys, cereal, bed sheets, pajamas and a whole lot of other merchandise. Then in 1990, we were given the first feature length movie which solidified the popularity of the Turtles. This film, released just a year later, is its sequel. It builds on the continuity of the original film but due to parental complaints and outcry over the violence of the first film, the tone is more light-hearted. It borrows the mood of the popular cartoon series and amps up the comedy. Many of the actors in the original film are missing or are replaced. Elias Koteas as Casey Jones was part of the charm of the first film, but sadly he is absent in this one. He is seemingly replaced by a made up character for this movie, Keno, played by Ernie Reyes Jr. April O'neal gets less screen time in this film than she did in the first and is also played by a different actress. The focus of the plot is switched from The Shredder and the Foot Clan to the origin of the ooze that mutated the turtles as well as an ongoing battle with a mutated wolf and snapping turtle.

The humor of the Turtles may be so 1990 but I still dig it. The opening scene in the shopping mall is way funny and a great way to introduce is to the sequel. At the time the style of the Turtles wasn't so stale, so the plot may seem a bit childish or dumb now.I have no doubts that if this movie were made today it would not be subtitled 'The Secret of the Ooze'. One can hardly expect high art from a movie called Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II but they could have subtitled it something a little less crass. Apparently taking place right after the first movie (where's Casey) it wastes no time bringing back the Shredder and the rest of the Foot Clan.This time Shredder aims to steal the cannister of ooze that mutated our heroes so he can make his own monsters to avenge his defeat. The result is Tokka and Rahzar and it seems like a half-attempt at a live-action version of Rocksteady and Bebop. As you can imagine, this plot isn't very clever. But the movie never really lulls so long as our heroes are on screen.Look out for a cameo by Vanilla Ice (looking alarmingly like Dolph Lundgren) at the end. It's so dated it may be difficult to watch but as long as your alone you won't have to cringe.The DVD has wonderful motion menus as well as a great 1.85:1 anamorphic picture with Dolby 5.1 sound.

This is a review for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II The Secret Of The Ooze. I haven't seen this movie or the 1st since 01 or 02 before then when I was younger I used to watch both TMNT 1 & II as often as I could. I mean I loved both live action movies & tried to collect all the action figures when I was younger I like the 80's cartoon when USA showd back when USA had a cartoon line up I don't know if they do anymore. As for the 3rd movie I remeber seeing it on VHS like in 93 or 94  remember not liking it. Anyway Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II was made on a budget of $25 million made $78 million. Directed by Michael Pressman this is the only movie that I have seen of his however he is a producer on Law & Order & Blue Bloods which I think Blue Bloods is the best Cop show on TV right now. There has been actress & actors that have been replaced April O'Neil is now played by Paige Turco & Francois Chou takes over as Shredder. As weel a couple of the voice actors have changed Raphael is now voiced by Laurie Faso & Donatello is voiced by Adam Carl now. Leif Tilden & Michelan Sisto stayed on as Donatello & Michaelanglo. Raphael is now played by Ken Tourm, Leonard is now played by Mark Caso. Kevin Clash still voices Splinter. The voice actors for Leonardo & Michaelanglo are still vocied by Robbie Rist & Brian Tochi.  Also stars Ernie Reyes jr as Keno, Toshishiro Obata as Tatsu, Mark Ginthar as Rahzar, Kurt Bryant as Tokka & David Warner as Professor Jordan Perry. The strory is pretty much a straight forward sequel sometime after the 1st movie you open up to New York City & for some reason everyone has a craving for pizza you are introduced to this kid named Keno who works a Pizza Delivery Boy he asks these girls out & they tell him in your dreams he comes back with a good 1 yeah I'll do that & maybe I'll dream about someone thinner than you. The movie went more for a lighthearted cheesy tone due to parents complaining about the violence in the 1st movie. Which the campier direction might be bad but it works it's not like Batman & Robin which had humor that made your stomach turn. Anyway Keno comes across some guys robbing a store he beats them up & then more of these thugs show up then The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arrive & I have always remembered this part the turtles go into jump kick stance it freezes & flashes the title screen the turtles proceed whoop these thugs. This is just a fun opening. They tie up the robbers tells Keno to call the cops & they take the pizza's they he was suppose to deliver but they did pay for them. The turtles live with April O'Neil in her new apartment. Tatsu has now taken over The Foot Clan but Shredder returns he wants revenge. Meanwhil April O'Neil resports on this story about The Techno Global Reserch Industries wherea a scientist named Jordan Perry is cleaning up an area that has been contaminated from their chemicals you have this guy named Freddy how works for the station & he also is spying on April. Professor Perry finds some dandelions that have grew due to the toxic waste. Freddy tells Shredder about it & later that night Tatsu & some Foot Soldiers have captured Professor Perry when he had destroyed all but 1 of the containers of The Ooze. Splinter tells the turtles about where the canister of ooze came from he show that it came from TGRI. So they go to check it out where they't met by a bunch of Foot Soldiers. They try to stop Tatsu from leaving with the ooze ultimatly they fail in stoping him. Then at April's Aprartment Keno delivers some pizza's he finds out who the turtles are & he decides to help them by posing as a new recuit for The Foot Clan. The turtles find this old abandoned Subway that they use as their new home. Raphael goes out for a walk where he joins up with Keno. Keno gets in The Foot Clan sp Raphael can find out where their new hideout is at. While they're escaping Raphael spot Shredder. then they bump into Tatsu. Raphael tries to fight them off but he is captured Keno runs off to tell the others what's going on. Meanwhile Shredder has Professor Perry use the ooze to make some creatures Tatsu brings in an Alligator Snapping Turtle & a Wolf. The Snapping Turtle is mutated into Tokka & The Wolf becomews Rahzar. Who at 1st aren't all there originally the producers wanted Bebop & Rocksteady from the cartoon but the original writers of the comic book were against it. Anyway Tokka & Rahyzar think that Shredder is their Mom & they hug him which was funny. Shredder watns them killed Professor Perry tells him you can't kill them they're living creatures. Since he sees how strong they are he decides that they are useful after all. Donatello, Michaelanglo & Leonardo go to the junkyard where they fall into a trap they're caught in this net Spliter fires a bow & arrow & cuts the rope they free Raphale & fight The Foot Clan Shredder has Tokka & Rahyzar go after the turtles. Michaleanglo says ""Didn't we see these guys on Wrestlemania?"" They get owned by these new monsters. Donatello is thrown by 1 of the creatures & he falls into 1 of the warehouses where he finds Professor Perry. Michaelanglo finds a manhole when he was thrown to the ground by 1 of the creatures they all make their escape. Tokka tries to follow them but is stuck in the hole Michaelanglo decides to have some fun & tickle Tokka's feet. I did get a laugh ou tof that. Shredder lets Tokka & Rahzar loose they knock down some telphone poles & crush some cars. The next sday Freddy reveals that he is working with The Foot Clan to April he tells her to tell the turtles if they don't meet Tokka & Rayzar at the construction site then Shredder will let them loose in Centeral Park. Professor Perry comes up with serium that can mutate Tokka & Rayzar back. They go to the construction site they try to trick Tokka & Rahzor but putting the erium tablets into donuts. Leonardo says we would like to have the traditional pre fight donut. But they find the cubs in the donuts. The turtles get roughed up their fight goes all the way into this dance club where Vanilla Ice is performing the look & feel is totlally early 90's. Everybody thinks it's part of the show 1 of them say that they love the costume's. The turtles try to fight Tokka & Rahzar Vanilla Ice singing ""Go ninja go ninja go."" Professor Perry shows up he tells Donatello that C 0 2 will get the serium to work so Donatello & Leonardo grab some fire extinguishers Raphael & Michaelanglo use these barrels to knock Tokka & Rahzar down Leonardo & Donatello spray the fire extinguishers into Tokka & Rahzar's mouths & they return to their normal forms. You have all 4 turtles on stage getting down. Keno decides to help the turtles. Shredder shows up & he has the last canister of ooze Keno shows up & kicks the canister of ooze out of his hand. Shredder takes a girl & threatens to use a small vial of ooze on her. Donatell turns the speakers up to full blast Michaelanglo plays a keytar & the force is so great that it throws Shredder out of the club & outside into the river. I lmao on that. They go out & look for Shredder who took the ooze & has became Super Shredder played by former Pro Wrestler Kevin Nash. Basically he breaks the support on the dock & ends up crushing himself to death. I would've liked a longer fight with The Turtles & Super Shredder but what am I going to do about it they had to tone the violence down. The turtles go home Splinter shows a newspaper with them fighting & he makes them tdo 30 backflips he says ""Go ninja go ninja go."" TMNT II is a good sequel  I would put in the class with Robocop 2 & Predator 2 not as good as the 1st but comes close. The costumes & animatronics are still top quality by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. The more cheesy tone works. You still have the family unit vibe. Michael Pressman did a very good job. John Du Prez's score isn't as good as the 1 he did for the 1st film but it's ok. Francois Chou did a pretty good job. Toshishiro Obata was there he was ok. Paige Turco did a good job. Ernie Reyes jr was good. David Warner did a pretty good job. Mark Caso, Michaelan Sisti Leif Tilden & Ken Tourm did fine. Brian Tochi , Robbie Rist, Adam Carl & Laurie Faso did a good job providing the voices. Only a couple of minor things hold it back from being as good as the 1st but a solid sequel overall.

But, this is one of the few cases where the second installment of a franchise actually surpasses the original.  TMNT II is one wild, hilarious, action-packed ride from beginning to end.  The movie delivers plenty of what you'd expect from the awesome foursome.  The fight sequences are better performed while the comedy keeps the interest peaked and ready for more.  While searching for secrets of their origin, the half-shelled heroes are confronted with enemies both old and new as the Shredder returns armed with two new super mutants as he seeks revenge after his ""demise"" at the end of the first film.  All in all, the turtles' second outing is a smashing success and will definitely satisfy any fan of the series.  My only personal regret is the fact that we didn't get to see more of Super Shredder.

The action scenes are fantastic.I must admit, however, that the script is weak at times.  The two evil mutants are also rather annoying.

You can't take it too seriously and the movie works well to just have fun with Leo, Donnie, Ralph and Mikey.  The one flaw of this movie was no more crazy Casey Jones and the addition of that annoying Asian kid Keno (Surf Ninjas, another classicly bad great movie).

And I must say though I find the first movie a fun and entertaining movie, I found this sequel lots more fun and better than the first!It's only been a short while since the end of Shredder and the scattering of the Foot Clan. Searching for a new home, Leonardo (Mark Caso), Raphael (Kevin Scott), Michaelangelo (Michelan Sisti), Donatello (Leif Tilden), and their master Splinter (Kevin Clash) are forced to stay with their reporter friend April O'Neil (Paige Turco). But soon they discover that a TGRI scientist Professor Jordan Perry (David Warner), might have some answers about the ooze that had mutated them 15 years ago. Unfortunately for them, they find out that the evil Shredder (Francois Chau) is still alive and regrouping his Foot Clan. Shredder also wants to discover the secret of the ooze so he steals the last container of it, along with the Professor. Can the turtles stop the Shredder before he puts his terrible plans to work? Also starring Ernie Reyes Jr. as Keno, a young teenager with martial skills, and special appearance by Vanilla Ice as himself performing a rap song.The whole atmosphere of ""The Secret of the Ooze"" is much brighter than the first movie, one good point for this movie. This is Jim Henson's last movie to work on so you will notice in the beginning you will read, ""In memory of Jim Henson"". He does an incredible job with the turtles and Splinter, and also with two other mutants Rahzar and Tokka.I found this movie to be a lot more funny and incredibly hilarious comparing to the first. I especially love it whenever Splinter tells his students to do '10 flips... now'. :) Another improved point in the movie from the first is the more likable Ninja Turtle's characters. Leonardo is more of a leader, though he is teased by Raphael about being so respectful to Mast Splinter. Raphael seems to have calmed to hot temper a lot more and is much more bearable. We can see Donatello's skills in computers and his love for science. And Michaelangelo, he's still a 'very cool dude'! I loved it when he started repeating lines from ""Casablanca"" to April. VERY funny!The fighting also feels better choreographed though the turtles don't use their weapons very much. The best fight scenes are the beginning fighting against the looters, all the fights against the Foot, the end fight with Rahzar and Tokka. Keno is also a very exceptionally martial artists and it's fun to see him pull a few of his own moves.To sum it up, don't miss out on ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Secret of the Ooze""! I assure that you'll simply love it! Rated PG for the fighting though not at all graphic. No language problems so this movie should be no problem for younger kids. And the movie is for the whole family since my parents also loved watching this with me! But I recommend you first see the first movie because throughout the movie there are references to it.

This movie took everything the first movie did, but made it HUGE.  More mutants, ooze, a friggen 90s style hip hop dance even (this was popular at the time, remember the Urkel Dance?).All the actors did a good job.  The new asian kid had some slick martial arts abilities, and his fresh, headstrong attitude added much to this movie.  Even the British dude from Titanic was good.  The ninja rap at the end of the movie is hilarious to watch today, but at the time was the coolest thing on the planet.

The Story continues When Splinter shows the turtles the empty canister that once had ooze that transformed him and the turtles 15 years ago. The canister matches events going on a TGRI:Techno Global Research Industries.The Turtles must find out ""the secret of the ooze"". The Shredder returns and wips out a plan to defeat the turtles, he forces Professer Jordan Perry,CEO of TGRI to mutate a Wolf and a snapping turtle into humanoid creatures. The same mutation that transformed the Turtles and Splinter,he names his creatures Toka and Razar. The Turtles soon stop Toka and Razar and defeat the Shredder. This sequel is awsome,more high kicking action,funny and entertaining, the Turtles still ruled in this one. I recommend this If you saw TMNT: The Movie and if you watched the show as a child. Bring home Mikey,Donny,Leo and Raph in their second high kicking adventure.

It has the coolest/greatest opening sequence out of all of the TMNT movies, the foot soldiers, Paige Turco as April, and most of all, SUPER SHREDDER! Let's not forget Vanilla Ice's ""out of nowhere"" performance as himself, performing ""Ninja Rap"". What more could a young TMNT fan ask for (especially in the early-to-mid 1990's!)?In this film, the turtles find the substance that made them mutate into humanoids, and they find out where it came from. Shredder finds out about it as well, and he uses it to become SUPER SHREDDER, as well as create two monsters that will defeat the turtles, Rahzar and Tokka! So, basically the turtles have to recover the ooze, and defeat Shredder and his monsters.Sure, the film seems to be ""sooooo 90's"". Sure, the TMNT fad from my childhood is over. However, this film holds up well, as does the first film. Today, I'd consider this a great B-movie, or even a guilty pleasure. If you were a fan of TMNT during the late 80's/early 90's, check this out if you haven't already! Oh, and do yourself a favor by AVOIDING the third TMNT film. It's atrocious.",5,"The best TMNT movie?
