You'd think that on the cutting floor they'd look at these low quality films and just trash them before they are released.  I love good Christian films and this is not one.  As it ended, our whole family just balked, and the kids we're like ""Are you kidding me? This was horrible.""  The music is awkward, the acting is just BAD, and the story line is so weak.  Make sure that if you have to watch it, that you rent it.  And please, don't give this as a gift, it's just an embarrassment to the Christian film industry.  I trusted this as a Dove award winner and should have read up on it more.  It is  not a good family film.  If you want a better film, move over to Hidden Secrets, or To Save A Life they are much better than this.  I usually don't write ratings but just had to on this one.  And by the way, I did buy this, all 14 bucks worth.  It did however move through the shredder just fine with no problems at all.",1,"Oh No, Another B Christian film....Ugh.",1367193600,"04 29, 2013",2013,972,"['Who', 'put', 'together', 'Oh', 'just', 'terrible', ""'d"", 'think', 'cutting', 'floor', ""'d"", 'look', 'low', 'quality', 'films', 'just', 'trash', 'are', 'released', 'love', 'good', 'Christian', 'films', 'not', 'one', 'ended', 'whole', 'family', 'just', 'balked', 'kids', ""'re"", 'Are', 'kidding', 'was', 'horrible', 'music', 'awkward', 'acting', 'just', 'BAD', 'story', 'line', 'so', 'weak', 'Make', 'sure', 'have', 'watch', 'rent', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'gift', 'just', 'embarrassment', 'Christian', 'film', 'industry', 'trusted', 'Dove', 'award', 'winner', 'should', 'have', 'read', 'up', 'more', 'not', 'good', 'family', 'film', 'want', 'better', 'film', 'move', 'Hidden', 'Secrets', 'Save', 'A', 'Life', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'write', 'ratings', 'just', 'had', 'one', 'way', 'did', 'buy', '14', 'bucks', 'worth', 'did', 'however', 'move', 'shredder', 'just', 'fine', 'problems']",Crossroad
1635316,A1YTR8FI6UPMA6,B00BL6CWM6,Get Serious,"[0, 1]","Written, directed and edited by Youssefian this is a character interaction screenplay. It's low-budget...the entire thing takes place in a caf&eacute;! These are relatively difficult to write correctly. To make it work, the writer does use contrived license in that the seven or so primary actors all have links to someone else in the group. It is written backwards, so that these commonalities are slowly revealed as the screenplay moves forward. The storyline could have been adequate without the 'God thing' and this may put a lot of people who don't like propaganda off from watching it. If you can ignore that, it is a good study in what actors can do with little action, blowing stuff up or rolling over cars. The idea is to surprise the viewer as realizations are slowly revealed and the writer is successful in doing this. Editing is tight and contributes to proper interaction. Everything matters in viewing this, so you can't do your taxes or be distracted during the viewing.
