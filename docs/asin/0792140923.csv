126162,A1VQBHHXIKHIGS,0792140923,A Customer,"[4, 6]","In my mind, I had the bare bones of a scathing review that would showcase my slyness and writing skill. I was ready to hate this movie. Dumb guy juxtapositioned into great moments in history? Life is like a box of chocolates? Tom Hanks? Much to hate. However, I enjoyed it. If you ever see a guy in a white suit waiting for a bus, don't sit with him or he'll tell you his life story. I jest. It's a fine movie.My dislike of Tom Hanks goes way back to a sitcom called BOSOM BUDDIES, built on the unbelievable premise that the only way these two guys could find an apartment was to dress as women. What I noticed, week after week, was that Tom Hanks' lack of talent dragged down Peter Scolari. I've also seen Hanks in SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, THE GREEN MILE and APOLLO 13, and he did nothing in any of them to raise my opinion of him.(APOLLO 13 works because a skilled ensemble cast and a wooden ""hero"" to lead them can be a highly effective device. Schwarzeneggar built a career on this, and I don't fault him for it.)But I can't conceive of anyone except Hanks as Forrest, Forrest Gump. He was excellent. I'm also proud that I immediately recognized the young actor from THE SIXTH SENSE when he was but a brief flash of hair. He has a presence that we'll enjoy for many years.The marketing department dropped the ball on this movie. They made it sound like I'd learn some deep life lessons from a guy with half my IQ. An offensive premise, and I don't even believe in IQ tests. It's not like that at all. It's such an unusual juxtaposition (there's that word again) that nobody knew how to pitch it accurately. Sometimes it's like that. We're authors. We know this better than anyone.

126163,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0792140923,Acute Observer,"[5, 17]","This film is a parody on American culture. Think of it as a comic book with actors instead of cartoon character. Does it remind you of Voltaire's ""Candide""? It starts by telling you it is who your Mom knows that is important, not what you know. We see how a mentally handicapped boy can get a college education through physical superiority (running). What else matters? Sending Forrest into the Army provides another way to reference the events of the 1960s. Jenny tells Forrest to ""run away"" from troubles; he does take her advice even if she doesn't. Forrest arrives in Vietnam, and rescues many of the wounded. After being wounded, Forrest recuperates and learns to be a ping-pong expert.Forrest gets the Medal of Honor and moons LBJ! [Some sort of comic touch?] The scenes of anti-war protest were re-created with some historical scenes. Next we wee Forrest as part of Nixon's historic flip-flop in recognizing Red China. Another amusing spot is putting Forrest on the Dick Cavett show with John Lennon. Forrest celebrates New Year with Lt. Dan, but things go awry. In another joke Forrest is at the Watergate Hotel when he reports men with flashlights in a dark room! So Forrest buys a shrimp boat and does well. His money is invested in an apple company and he becomes so rich he can work for free! Jenny returns and finds her old house an abandoned derelict. [Does this foretell her future?] Forrest's cross-country run parodies the jogging craze and the bumper-sticker mentality. Reporters ask whats its all about? People follow him like the lemmings of fiction. Then its over.Forrest gets a letter from Jenny, visits her and finds a little Forrest, the smartest boy in his class [mocking the ""science"" of eugenics?]. And then they marry, but don't live happily ever after. {A subtle joke?] The ending show little Forrest getting on a school bus, and Forrest sits and waits.

Forrest just had TOO many strokes of good luck and situations where he was at the right place at the right time to make it a good story in that respect. This might not be anyone else's definition of a good story, but it is certainly mine...Also, all the characters in this movie, especially Jenny's and Lt. Dan's, are just a huge cliche of amateur psychology and kitch... Nothing original or unexpected about them - two dimentional in other words.Many people here speak of the movie's great message of the triumph of human nature. But everything Forrest did was not because he knew it was the right thing to do at the moment, but just because he was there and he reacted to the situation in the only way he knew how to. I've read a review that brought his shrimping sucess as an example: the only reason Forrest became successful was because everyone else's ship sank, not because he did something extraordinarily well... Forrest did not think about the great task of representing his country while playing ping pong in China - he just did what he knew how to do, play ping pong.... And there are numerous other examples.But the worst part of this movie experience was Tom Hanks. I think that he has great potential as an actor - see Philadelphia, for instance. But since then, he seems to be acting out the same character over and over again: the basically good guy who'll eventually win - I couldn't tell the difference between any 2 parts if they weren't in different customs and situations.

Forrest Gump doesn't seem to have an opinion about anything, except for a general optimism. When he runs across the country, reporters catch up to him and ask whether he is running for the environment, women's rights, or world peace, or what. He replies, ""I just feel like runnin'!"" He wins the medal of honor in Vietnam yet loves a girl who is mixed in with people who oppose the war. When Forrest makes a speech about the war, the plug is pulled and we don't hear a word he says about it. A Black Panther gives him a stern lecture about his group's ideology, but Forrest is tuned out, only paying attention to Jenny. Forrest explains many things as ""and for no particular reason at all..."" for example, the shootings of several famous people in his lifetime. When Forrest meets the president all he has to say about it is he loved how there was free Dr. Pepper and free food.He goes through many turbulent times in our nation's history and is tuned out of them but by no means totally tuned out of life. He has fierce determination, as when he runs with all his might on the football field for the touchdown, then continues into the locker room at full speed. Although stupid, he is still a very dynamic character who succeeds at everything he does, and still remains a nice guy. With all his success adding up he does not become cocky or corrupted or lose vision of what really matters. He inspires many others and spreads his good influence around very well and doesn't even realize how great he is. Forrest moves through a world which is increasingly becoming less moral, more violent and confused. Yet he manages to leave the world a little better than he found it.I can't totally agree with the thought that the film portrays sexuality as immoral. Recall that Forrest's mother had sex with the principal to get her son into a mainstream school. Also, Forrest has an illegitimate child to which Jenny assures him he did nothing wrong. The kid turns out just fine and Forrest turns out to be a great father. Some think the film tells us that conformity and following orders unquestioningly will lead to success. Why, then, does Forrest blatantly disobey Lt. Dan's order to leave him in the woods and instead, save his life? Also, when Forrest prepares to buy his own shrimp boat, everyone tells him he's stupid to do that but he simply replies ""Stupid is as stupid does, sir"" and goes ahead with his promise and his dream to go into the shrimping business.Despite the inspiring action throughout the movie by Forrest, the movie ends sadly. Also, being that Jenny apparently died of AIDS which was a new disease back then, there is a strong possibility Forrest has it, too being that Jenny is his wife. But one message of the movie is that we all die sooner or later and that dying is a part of life.Will the story of Forrest Gump make you feel inspired? Probably. Will it actually change your life?

126188,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0792140923,Andrew Ellington,"[10, 15]","I know that I should love this movie since everyone else in the world does, but I can't help but get this overwhelming singe of disappointment every time I sit down to watch this movie (which isn't often, but I recently watched this for the third time thinking that maybe I was harsh on it the first two times).  `Forrest Gump' is what I consider, as my title suggests, mediocrity done extremely well.  It's what happens when you take a clich&eacute; ridden story and fill it with gimmicky characters who speak mind-numbing (albeit entertaining) dialog.  There is a layer of originality that spreads itself thin over the film, but overall the film is bogged down by its own aspirations.  It is trying way to hard and failing most of the way.  It is not a bad film, but it is no where near the top of the pack, not even in 1994, which was a sub par year in general.I know that `Forrest Gump' has its rabid supporters (thus the reason that every review under a five-star gets trashed by the next reviewer) and I am literally stripped of my dignity every time this movie is brought up among friends since apparently I am the only person I know who sees that there is simply nothing here to get excited over (actually I do remember one time that one of my friends nodded in agreement with me, and then his wife let us both have it).So I don't get yelled at, there are some spoilers below, so be forewarned.So, here are my issues with `Forrest Gump'.  The story is actually good in my opinion, or at least the idea behind it.  Having one man make an unintentional impact on the entire world and be utterly clueless to it is actually interesting.  If the plot hadn't been muddled with clich&eacute;d characters from the very beginning then it really could have been worked into genius.  But that wasn't the case.  The character of Forrest isn't the biggest clich&eacute; (although he is clich&eacute;d, don't get me wrong) but all the people around him (from his mother to his war buddy to the love of his life) are so `been-there-done-that' that I can't understand why someone didn't stop production and ask why they couldn't create something a little different.  The performances for the most part work to elevate the familiarity (especially Wright, whose character is probably the most clich&eacute;d in the bunch) but it doesn't really help much.Another problem that I have with `Forrest Gump' is Tom Hanks.  Hanks is kind of like the king of gimmick for me.  I don't think he is the strongest actor and it feels as if he relies to heavily on his characters gimmick's to elevate his performance and acceptance.  He won back to back Oscars for barely doing anything.  Really, he played a man dying of AIDS and then he played a man mentally handicapped, the two biggest Oscar bait gimmicks out there, but his personal performance was nothing spectacular.  The final frames of the film are truly the strongest, and yes, when he realizes that he has a child his reaction is raw and real and heartbreaking, especially when he asks if his son is smart, but honestly that is one scene (the best scene in the film mind you) and one scene does not make you a good actor.  Robin Wright Penn and Gary Sinise are actually very good here (Sally Field cannot step out of her character clich&eacute; long enough to do anything decent here) but there performances are muddled down by the mediocrity surrounding them.  I am not for one minute saying that no movie should be made about wounded war vets or the mentally handicapped or the drug addicted floozy, but when so much of it is thrown into the same pot it begins to feel as if no one involved with this project has an imagination.The film feels very force-fed at times, like it's spoon feeding the audience mouthfuls of manipulated sympathies.  I know that I am like the last person to complain about that since I cry every time I watch a Ron Howard film (talk about emotional manipulations) but Ron Howard has a way of making all that syrup go down smooth; and Zemeckis doesn't (at least for me).I just don't buy it.I don't know, maybe I am really harsh and maybe I take life way to seriously as some angered reviewers have claimed anyone who doesn't rave this movie must do.  I'm not saying that it isn't entertaining and even enjoyable.  This is just not an Oscar movie.  It's more of a C+ than an A+ in my book.  Like I said, it's done well, really well, but that still doesn't make up for the lapses in judgment on the part of the writers, directors and lead actor (at least he tries in some scenes here as apposed to his horrendously mediocre `Philadelphia' performance the previous year).  When I look back at the films that `Forrest Gump' beat out for the top prize (namely `The Shawshank Redemption', `Pulp Fiction' and the un-nominated `Heavenly Creatures') I am dumbfounded that the world fell for this living breathing clich&eacute;, wrapped in a feel good package.",3,Mediocrity at its finest...,1218153600,"08 8, 2008",2008,4915,"['know', 'should', 'love', 'movie', 'everyone',

As a school kid he has a crush on a girl (who later becomes his wife). He is good at running (which gets him into college). He becomes a war hero and meets the president. He fulfills a promise he made to his dying best friend (who died in his arms) and enters the shrimp boat industry. He asks God to help him succeed and God (instead of making more shrimp) helps him by destroying every other shrimp boat (you can't make this stuff up) and Gump becomes super rich. He has a child with his future wife and the kid is the ""smartest"" in his class. And all throughout this improbable story, he remains blissfully ignorant at how extraordinary it is.I want a film about the real world. This film does the mentally challenged no services.

After all, Australia has produced some pretty embarrassing lifestyle movies, including  Muriel's Wedding, Strictly ballroom and Crocodile Dundee. The thing is, no  one outside of your own country can see anything to be embarrassed about.  So I guess we should all just relax and enjoy the film.Forrest  Gump was an adorable piece of cinema. Tom Hanks was up to his usual high  quality, but the star of the film had to be the script. Every now and then  a movie comes out that is simply refreshing, and this was one of the best.  Forrest is a character permanently in the role as underdog, not because of  his failures but in spite of his successes.  It is not possible to feel  jealous of this good natured simpleton, no matter how many presidents he  meets or how much he earns. We always cheer him on.I had fun with  the movie on many levels. The script was full of double meanings and clever  references. The special effects were flawless and yet unnoticed. The  winding, serendipitous path Gump's life took was surprisingly believable.  And finally the characters were heart warming. The very lack of pretension  in Forest only served to highlight it in the &quot;normal&quot; characters.

The main character of the movie, Forrest Gump, is played by Tom Hanks. He is excellent at portraying himself as an ignorant southern man. Also, Tom Hanks does an amazing job imitating a southern accent.The visual effects of the movie are very impressive. Whether the directors are portraying Forrest Gump as an American soldier in the Vietnam War or as a football star on the Alabama Crimson Tide. The movie makes it seem as if Forrest Gump was actually there when those events took place. Also, throughout the whole entire movie the visual effects make it seem as if the filming crew was filming the events as they took place.The rating for this movie, PG-13, fits the movie very well. There is barely any inappropriate language or other inappropriate things. Also, the movie has such an exciting plot. Forrest Gump goes through so many remarkable things in his life that it is so hard to get distracted from watching the movie. Whether he is a ping pong champion in china, a shrimp boat captain, a soldier in the Vietnam War or when he, for a short time, is part of the Black Panthers. The plot and the movie, as a whole, are so interesting and a great movie to watch that it is so hard to get distracted from watching it.Also, this movie conveys a message.

However, Forrest Gump is my favorite of all the Tom Hanks movies.The cinemetography is exclusive and  brilliant, from the point where young Forrest runs out of his braces to the  look of terror on his face when he is carrying Bubba out of the enemy  fire.This is a beautiful movie, showing the tenderness and the courage  of one young man who can doing anything he sets his mind to do.  He ran  across the United States, and when he was done, he had nothing better to do  than to run across it again, and again, and again.He even fell in love  with a woman who totally did not deserve him.  Jenny was a beautiful child,  why couldn't they get someone equally beautiful, maybe like Melissa Sue  Anderson, to play the part of Jenny as an adult?  The makeup artists could  have made her look hard, and then soft.  I didn't much like Robin Wright in  the role, but then I'm not a fan of hers.The little girl who played  Jenny was spectacular, especially the part where she runs to the fields,  hides, and prays to God, &quot;Dear God, please make me a bird, so I can  fly far, far away!&quot;  It made me cry great big crocodile tears.The  little boy who played Hanks as a child was great, too.  I understand he  chose this child out of like 2000 kids or so to play the part.  I believe  Tom Hanks has a brother like Forrest, which made it easy for him to play  the part.Haley Joel Osment, who played Forrest Jr. has always been a  favorite little actor of mine.  I liked him in the Jeff Foxworthy Show and  other shows I've seen him in.  I haven't seen the Sixth Sense yet.  I know  this little boy is going to go a long, long way in his acting career, and I  just hope he doesn't turn out soured like a lot of really great child  actors and actresses have.It did not mention what disease Jenny got that  made her real sick and die in the movie, but it was just about that time in  history when AIDS was first brought to our attention.  She got her illness  from sleeping around and using drugs, so I reckon that must be what she  had.  Of course, it never said, so we don't know for sure.Tom Hanks  deserved his academy award for Forrest Gump.Isn't it amazing that one of  Sally Fields' first movies was playing girlfriend to Tom Hanks?  Yet, she  did a tremendous and wonderful role as his mother in Forrest Gump.  Sally  Field has got to be one of my favorite actresses.  I've seen her in just  about everything she has ever been in since The Flying Nun.Gary Sinise  played Lt. Dan, and he made a promise to Forrest that if Forrest ever owned  a shrimp boat, that Lt. Dan would come be his first mate.

126203,ANGH6401L9Y0T,0792140923,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[2, 2]","OK, I know what you're thinking: what's the matter with me that I didn't see this long ago? Well, in 1994, when it was in the theaters, I would not have gone to it without Steve, and he wasn't interested. And we never owned a DVD player. So I've really only had about three years or so to have come across it. Nobody who told me about it told me enough to appreciate that I probably would like it, including that Tom Hanks (the guy from ""DaVinci Code,"" but I didn't know the name then) was someone I would love as a terrific actor. Anymore than I would have believed I'd love Leonardo DiCaprio in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" until I saw him in ""Titanic."" In fact, he was so convincing in Grape that I thought it really was played by a retarded guy, just like the mother really was played by a morbidly obese woman. I mean, no actor can fake it that well, can they?Apparently some can.Forrest is not seriously retarded, after all, he's just ""a little slow,"" as his mother (Sally Fields) puts it. She's determined to see that he gets the best education possible. Very determined, as the principal of the school finds out. The other thing is he wears braces on his legs. Why? The quack his mother took him to acknowledges there's nothing wrong with his legs, but his back is ""as crooked as a question mark."" So why do braces on his legs have anything to do with curing his back? We never do find out. But one day when Forrest was being chased by bullies on bicycles, and is running as fast as he can, the braces just break and fall off, and he's running like the wind.Forrest also has a friend, Jenny, the girl who let him sit beside her on the school bus the first day, and they were ""like peas and carrots"" after that. Always together. He figures she's his girl, but she doesn't quite see it that way. In fact, as they go through life, they keep finding and losing each other.I won't go into all the details, but the basic premise of the story is that Forrest is sitting on a bench waiting for a bus, and gets talking to whomever sits next to him, whether they answer or not. Most of the story is thus told in flashbacks while he tells his experiences in a simple, straightforward way. He's met three presidents, the first one Kennedy as he was on an all-star football team, the second was Johnson as he was awarded the medal of honor for bravery in Vietnam (great story there; I'll let him tell it), and the third was Nixon, because of his central role in the ""ping pong diplomacy"" with the Chinese.In fact, he seems to always be involved in something which we remember from the news, one way or another. Not for anything he figures is all that special, but just for doing his job or for sheer coincidence. For example, when he meets Nixon, the president asks him how he likes Washington, and does he like his hotel. I don't remember what Forrest answered, but Nixon says he'll be more comfortable in this nice new hotel that only recently opened. That night he's in the Watergate and calls the front desk to report that ""they must have had a power out over there because there are people walking around with flashlights and everything."" Next thing you know, Nixon is resigning.He makes friends here and there, and these people keep popping up in his life in unexpected ways. Still, coincidence is never strained too far, because Forrest has gotten famous, so people who want to can find him.There's a lot of humor, and a lot of pathos, and they are mixed together just right. You won't pity Forrest, but you will learn to see the world through his eyes to an extent you would not have thought possible when the movie began. It's artfully done, and I'm not at all surprised that it earned six Oscars, including best picture. It's one of the best I've ever seen.",5,Deserves All Those Oscars,1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,3764,"['OK', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'what', 'matter', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'long', 'ago', 'Well', '1994', 'when', 'was', 'theaters', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'gone', 'Steve', 'was', ""n't"", 'interested', 'never', 'owned', 'DVD', 'player', ""'ve"", 'really', 'only', 'had', 'three', 'years', 'so', 'have', 'come', 'Nobody', 'who', 'told', 'told', 'enough', 'appreciate', 'probably', 'would', 'like', 'including', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'guy', 'DaVinci', 'Code', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'name', 'then', 'was', 'someone', 'would', 'love', 'terrific', 'actor', 'would', 'have', 'believed', ""'d"", 'love', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'saw', 'Titanic', 'fact', 'was', 'so', 'convincing', 'Grape', 'thought', 'really', 'was', 'played', 'retarded', 'guy', 'just', 'mother', 'really', 'was', 'played', 'morbidly', 'obese', 'woman', 'mean', 'actor', 'can', 'fake', 'well', 'can', 'Apparently', 'can.Forrest', 'not', 'seriously', 'retarded', 'just', 'little', 'slow', 'mother', 'Sally', 'Fields', 'determined', 'see', 'best', 'education', 'possible', 'Very', 'determined', 'principal', 'school', 'out', 'other', 'thing', 'braces', 'legs', 'Why', 'quack', 'mother', 'took', 'acknowledges', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'legs', 'back', 'as', 'crooked', 'question', 'mark', 'So', 'why', 'do', 'braces', 'legs', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'curing', 'back', 'never', 'do', 'find', 'out', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'Forrest', 'was', 'being', 'chased', 'bullies', 'bicycles', 'running', 'as', 'fast', 'can', 'braces', 'just', 'break', 'fall', 'off', 'running', 'wind.Forrest', 'also', 'friend', 'Jenny', 'girl', 'who', 'let', 'sit', 'school', 'bus', 'first', 'day', 'were', 'peas', 'carrots', 'together', 'girl', ""n't"", 'quite', 'see', 'way', 'fact', 'go', 'life', 'keep', 'finding', 'losing', 'other.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'details', 'basic', 'premise', 'story', 'Forrest', 'sitting', 'bench', 'waiting', 'bus', 'talking', 'whomever', 'sits', 'answer', 'not', 'Most', 'story', 'thus', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'experiences', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'way', 'met', 'three', 'presidents', 'first', 'one', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'all-star', 'football', 'team', 'second', 'was', 'Johnson', 'was', 'awarded', 'medal', 'honor', 'bravery', 'Vietnam', 'great', 'story', ""'ll"", 'let', 'tell', 'third', 'was', 'Nixon', 'central', 'role', 'ping', 'pong', 'diplomacy', 'Chinese.In', 'fact', 'always', 'be', 'involved', 'something', 'remember', 'news', 'one', 'way', 'Not', 'anything', 'special', 'just', 'doing', 'job', 'sheer', 'coincidence', 'example', 'when', 'Nixon', 'president', 'how', 'Washington', 'like', 'hotel', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'what', 'Forrest', 'answered', 'Nixon', ""'ll"", 'be', 'more', 'comfortable', 'nice', 'new', 'hotel', 'only', 'recently', 'opened', 'night', 'Watergate', 'front', 'desk', 'report', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'power', 'there', 'are', 'people', 'walking', 'flashlights', 'everything', 'Next', 'thing', 'know', 'Nixon', 'resigning.He', 'friends', 'here', 'there', 'people', 'keep', 'popping', 'up', 'life', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'Still', 'coincidence', 'never', 'strained', 'too', 'far', 'Forrest', 'gotten', 'famous', 'so', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'can', 'find', 'lot', 'humor', 'lot', 'pathos', 'are', 'mixed', 'together', 'just', 'right', 'wo', ""n't"", 'pity', 'Forrest', 'will', 'learn', 'see', 'world', 'eyes', 'extent', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'thought', 'possible', 'when', 'movie', 'began', 'artfully', 'done', ""'m"", 'not', 'surprised', 'earned', 'six', 'Oscars', 'including', 'best', 'picture', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen']",N/A

The DVD has done a great job in preserving its great quality.  First, the picture quality is superb.  The colors and definition are crisp.  Take a look and you'll notice great clarity in each scene.  The 5.1 sound is decent.  It doesn't employ all 5 channels of sound to the fullest extent, but it'll do for most people.Now for the special features.  Disc 1 offers great, comprehensive commentaries by the producers and the director, Robert Zemeckis.  While other directors provide useless information, this commentary is actually informative and pertinent to what's shown on screen.  Disc 2 is simply amazing.  Do you want to know how Forrest Gump was made and then some?  Disc 2 is all you need.  Considering how great the special effects were, this set of bonus features are very welcome and entertaining.If you own an the older, original copy of the Forrest Gump DVD, set it aside and get this new one.

126208,AH1KJ45IQTM4T,0792140923,Benjamin,"[6, 7]","I rate this movie 5 stars, or 9,5/10. This is one of the 100 Best America movies of All Times (#71 to be more exact) and it is included in the 1000 Best Movies in DVD by Peter Travers. The movie won 6 Oscars, including Best Director for Robert Zemeckis (""Back to the Future""), Picture, and Actor (Tom Hanks speech went like this: ""If Forrest Gump was here tonight he'd say: ""I went to the Academy Awards AGAIN, and they gave me the Oscar AGAIN!"" making reference at his Oscar for Philadelphia the previous year), and Best Effects (there is a great documentary on that in the second DVD on this edition), Best Film Editing, and Best Writing based on Material from Another Medium. Special mention deserves the music on the film, going over most of the hits of the late 50's and the 60's. So if you like R'n'R, go and buy the Soundtrack as well!The movie depicts the story of Forrest Gump, a mentally retarded kid who makes it to the top. That can be understood in, at least, two different ways: 1. Any mentally retarded can do good in America. 2. America is the land of opportunity where anybody who tries hard can make it. But this is a movie, a very good movie. So it's a piece of entertainment, and I just watched the movie today (I just watched a couple of times when I came out 12 years ago), and I had a lot of fun. As an example, when Gump goes to the Army, he is very good just following orders, not even thinking about it, so his Sargent tells him ""You must have an IQ of 160!"". That, in my opinion, is really funny, and a very witty critic to the Army, where all they need is ""robots"" who can just obey without even thinking. There is also something remarkable. When Forrest Gump comes back from Vietnam, he happens to be at Washington D.C., where there is a huge demonstration against the War. The city is taken by hippies and pacifists. Jenny, the woman of his dreams, is there. They meet. And her boyfriend smashes her in fornt of him. Forrest Gump, the ""baby-killer"" from Vietnam, as he is called, defends her violently. But it's obvious that the guy who is a ""pacifist"" was using violence with her, using bad language and in acts. That is nothing put there by chance. It has a meaning. There was violence in Vietnam, in the war, at home, by the police, but also by the protesters. And that is something that has rarely been told. They were using drugs to ""liberate"" themselves, but that was -in my opinion- another violent way to express themselves. There are a lot of details like that in the movie, that no one could miss. For instance, when the mother of Forrest Gump tries to enroll him at a Regular Elementary school, the Principal is trying to explain her that Forrest's IQ is below normal, and that he should be going to a special school (there was no inclusion at that time). The mother thinks Forrest should have the same opportunities as anybody else, so she offers herself to do ""anything"" possible to allow Forrest to go to a regular school. And the Principal takes advantage of her. That is another very intelligent critic to things that, unfortunately, are still happening today. Another thing is when Forrest goes to college. Once he graduates, he tells us in plain English ""After 5 years playing football, they gave me a degree"". So, after 5 years doing nothing, I graduated anyway. Does it sound famiiar? Read between the lines!To end with this review, I will just say that this is a GREAT movie, very entertaining, well done (the sound in the war scenes is just superb!), a pleasure to watch, with a lot of fun moments, some tender ones, and it tells us a little bit about the history of the US from the 50's to the 80's. It's not that ""retarded"". It is a very witti one, and it deserves the place it made in the History of Cinema. This is a special edition with 2 DVD's, very CHEAP and highly recommended.

To be honest I really don't like it because unrequited love makes me sad. This is a sweet story about Forrest and his undying love of his friend Jenny. Forrest has a handicap in which he has to wear leg braces until the age of 9, and he's also slow mentally. Jenny is a poor girl who is molested by her single father until she's taken away from him. The roads that Jenny and Forrest end up taking are different as night and day. Jenny ends up in a world of drugs, sex, and rock and roll while Forrest now having shed his leg braces has gone onto college to play football, and enlist in the Marines, and goes to Veitnam, and becomes a successful entreprenuer, but still longs to have Jenny by his side, but circumstances keep pushing her away from him, and then Forrest does something that I wish I could do if I could afford to, and that's run back and forth across the United States. He runs to get rid of all the demons within him; meaning all the hurt, rejection, and anything that was bothering him. I know I'm carrying alot of baggage around within me, and I also have alot of responsibilities that I wish I could just run from, but I couldn't abandon my son, so I consider writing reviews on here as my way of running back and forth across the United States. I write about how movies, music, and books affect me, and hope that there's an understanding audience out there to know what I go through. I know some of it doesn't make sense, but I have to get my feelings out somehow.Anyway after Forrest gets back from running back and forth across the United States he finally gets Jenny as she comes home to Forrest, and introduces him to his son, and Jenny has AIDS, so Forrest loving her still marries her, so he gets her in the end, but it's a short, but sweet marriage as she ends up dying. I know that my wife died, and I'm left to raise my son on my own, so that's another way this movie speaks to me. It's good, but I don't know if I will ever own it as I still don't like unrequited love, but I guess none of us do. I also feel that the line ""Life is a box of chocolates...you never know what you'll get."" is overused here, and while there's probably a note of wisdom in this I just think it's lame.

126256,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,0792140923,David Baldwin,"[2, 3]","""Forrest Gump"" is a prime example of how good acting can overcome a mediocre script and OK direction.  This film does not so much contain a story but a series of random events that our hero stumbles into(Stupid is as stupid does).  What is most impressive about Robert Zemeckis' direction is how CGI is utilized to integrate his characters into historical events.  What least impresses is how these techniques detract from the characters.  What distinguishes this film is the acting, particularly Tom Hanks as Forrest.  Yes, Forrest has an I.Q. of 80, but he's nobody's fool.  What ingratiates you to this character is that he has a heart a mile wide.  This is a tricky bit of acting that Hanks does here because playing somebody who is mentally challenged is a slippery slope(If you want an example of how not to play the mentally retarded,see or don't see Cliff Robertson's performance in ""Charly"").  The film also benefits from a superb supporting cast with Gary Sinise as the embittered Lt. Dan, Robin Wright as Jenny(though I thought it too much that she had to suffer so many indignities), Mykelti Williamson as Bubba, and Sally Field as Forrest's mother.

If you're reading this, you probably already have a pretty good idea if the movie's digitally enhanced nostalgia and praise to the virtues of simplicity will appeal to you or not.  So I'm just going to talk about what I thought of the DVD.  The film enthusiast and the Gump fan will find a fair amount of interesting stuff to peruse, but the bonus feature are unfortunately kind of hit or miss.  It's neat seeing exactly how all of the special effects were done or how sound and makeup were used to enhance mood in particular scenes.  The screen test are nice enough, if only because you get to see Tom Hanks playing Forrest before he had worked out the accent.  And the Zemeckis/Starket/Carter commentary, while lacking the fun and spontanaity of some I've heard, provides enough good tidbits and insights to keep you interested.  But these pretty good features run alongside some really poor ones.  The Finerman commentary runs out of steam very early and lapses into the producer repeating herself (apparently there are at least TWO seperate scenes where Forrest first becomes a man) and talking about what she thinks the audience is feeling or thinking at that point in the movie.  (I don't need to know what the audience is thinking.  I AM the audience.)  Add a photo gallery that is half stills from the movie and a pretty bland documentary and you pretty much have the disc in a nutshell.  I guess if you really love Gump or absolutely need to know more about the effects, you'll really enjoy the disc.  But the rest of us are left a little unsatisfied and wondering why a movie that supposedly relied more on a great script than visual effects has a disc of extras which touch so little on the former and so much on the latter.",3,Life is like a disc of bonus features.....,1003017600,"10 14, 2001",2001,1815,"['think', 'merits', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'debated', 'enough', 'now', ""'re"", 'reading', 'probably', 'already', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'movie', 'digitally', 'enhanced', 'nostalgia', 'praise', 'virtues', 'simplicity', 'will', 'appeal', 'not', ""'m"", 'just', 'going', 'talk', 'what', 'thought', 'DVD', 'film', 'enthusiast', 'Gump', 'fan', 'will', 'find', 'fair', 'amount', 'interesting', 'stuff', 'peruse', 'bonus', 'feature', 'are', 'unfortunately', 'kind', 'hit', 'miss', 'neat', 'seeing', 'exactly', 'how', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'done', 'how', 'sound', 'makeup', 'were', 'used', 'enhance', 'mood', 'particular', 'scenes', 'screen', 'test', 'are', 'nice', 'enough', 'only', 'get', 'see', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'playing', 'Forrest', 'had', 'worked', 'out', 'accent', 'Zemeckis/Starket/Carter', 'commentary', 'lacking', 'fun', 'spontanaity', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'enough', 'good', 'tidbits', 'insights', 'keep', 'interested', 'pretty', 'good', 'features', 'run', 'alongside', 'really', 'poor', 'ones', 'Finerman', 'commentary', 'steam', 'very', 'early', 'producer', 'repeating', 'apparently', 'are', 'least', 'TWO', 'seperate', 'scenes', 'where', 'Forrest', 'first', 'man', 'talking', 'what', 'audience', 'feeling', 'thinking', 'point', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'know', 'what', 'audience', 'thinking', 'AM', 'audience', 'Add', 'photo', 'gallery', 'half', 'stills', 'movie', 'pretty', 'bland', 'documentary', 'pretty', 'much', 'have', 'disc', 'nutshell', 'guess', 'really', 'love', 'Gump', 'absolutely', 'need', 'know', 'more', 'effects', ""'ll"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'disc', 'rest', 'are', 'left', 'little', 'unsatisfied', 'wondering', 'why', 'movie', 'supposedly', 'relied', 'more', 'great', 'script', 'visual', 'effects', 'disc', 'extras', 'touch', 'so', 'little', 'former', 'so', 'much', 'latter']",N/A

Segregation, race riots, JFK, Vietnam, war protests, LBJ and Watergate are all covered here in new perspectives.

126277,A2198FZZMTJ38H,0792140923,D. Litton,"[4, 5]","&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is a very special movie, a movie in which so many values, traditions, historical events and occurrences are all seen through the eyes of one man who is affected by all of the above mentioned aspects of life. This man is the very embodiment of American innocence in a time when that innocence was fading from sight, with such events as the Vietnam War and segregation issues plaguing the country, and through his simple words and actions, we are able to appreciate the lives in which we live on a much more elevated level.The film is a complex and stunning journey that involves many characters, all of whom represent a separate and unique stereotype of the 50's, 60's and 70's. The events portrayed throughout the movie are handled with such meticulous detail and through the eyes of Forrest Gump, we see everything in a whole new light. His simplicity and limited education seem more of a blessing than a curse, and it may cause viewers to look at their own lives and take stock of themselves as well.Forrest's journey begins in his early years, as a skinny child who must wear leg braces for his crooked back. His mother will do just about anything for him, including giving special favors to the public school principle in order to get her son enrolled. On his first day of school, he meets a young girl named Jenny, whom he falls in love with at first sight. He will carry this love with him for the rest of his life, protecting her from her abusive father and staying by her side through their school years. His high school career offers him a position on football team, which leads him to college, where he becomes ensconced in many different cultures and beliefs, as well as his first taste of segregation. Jenny begins to branch off into more risqu&eacute; lines of work, evolving into the drifter hippie that so symbolized the 60's.Forrest stays in touch with her, even after he is drafted and sent to Vietnam to fight in the war. There, he meets Bubba Blue, and they become fast friends due to their ostracization from the rest of the group's men. Their commanding officer, Lieutenant Dan Taylor, is harsh and strict, so it comes as no surprise that when a battle goes terribly wrong, he loathes Gump for pulling him out instead of leaving him to die. From this point on, Forrest will become a national hero as well as someone that every human being, decent or loathsome, can come to admire.Forrest's simplicity and small outlook on life is such a blessing for him, and that is shown through the plot of this movie. He sees everything going on around him, but none of it ever really registers in his mind the way it would someone of a higher IQ. Forrest lives his life the way a child would that has been taught by his mother the values of life, and Forrest holds extremely true to those values, never breaching them for a second. His small outlook on such a vast melting pot of societal woes becomes the way in which we would like to look at the world, and at ourselves.The movie also places Forrest in slight interaction with historical figures, ranging from John F. Kennedy's congratulating of the All-American football team, to Richard Nixon's resignation from the White House. Even though his involvement with these events is purely fictional, it offers much needed comical relief for such a serious film. This is where the film gets to use some very effective special effects in order to incorporate Forrest into real footage taken of the events portrayed within the movie, and it does so seamlessly and without flaw.The story's characters all act as a representation of some stereotype from the decades the movie covers. Forrest is not a conservative, nor is he an activist, but rather one of the people that watches from the sidelines as the country falls apart before his eyes. Jenny becomes the hippie, the rebel of society who does drugs and men, following what is considered cool even when it puts her in danger. Lieutenant Dan is the wounded Vietnam officer who is forgotten by his country and the government and left to fend for himself. All of these characters give us diverse looks at the events at hand, while also providing an emotional outlet as we feel their pain and emotions.Tom Hanks gives his best and most memorable performance ever in this film. He plays Gump with all the simple-mindedness and naivety that the movie needs, and brings such vivid and emotional life to the movie. We believe in his ability to create such beautiful images with his simple words. Robin Wright plays his girl, Jenny, who has a profound effect on us despite her many mistakes in her life. Throughout the movie, she seems to be wanting something more than just the popular scene and lifestyle, and Wright brings all of that out with vivacity and excellence. Gary Sinise plays Lieutenant Dan, and his embittered attitude towards his country prove to be quite a challenge for Sinise, who readily accepts and makes the role his own. Mykelti Williamson is Bubba Blue, who is a bit smarter than Forrest in terms of understanding the country's upsets. And Sally Field plays Forrest's mother, sweet and charming, loving and warm. This is the Field we all know and have grown to love.&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; works on so many different levels of emotion, intensity and passion for life that it becomes a success many times over. It will not soon be forgotten, so long as we all look for a way to better simplify the events of our lives, seeing things with the naivety of a small boy who rose to such heights of fame yet never really realized his social status. To him, it didn't matter; he was just living life.",5,A perfect 10!,982886400,"02 23, 2001",2001,5642,"['quot', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'quot', 'very', 'special', 'movie', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'values',

It was the first film that I saw that really made me understand the importance of cinema in American culture.I was taken through a story that I didn't completely understand, because I was so young and didn't know much of the history presented in the movie.  I was interested by the way the film used special effects so that the character of Forrest would appear in different important historical events in 20th Century American history.Also, though I didn't realize it at the time, it was beautifully made from the cinematography to the set design to the music, and perhaps most important, the acting and directing.Tom Hanks makes you believe that he is Forrest, which is so hard to do.  The acting in some of the scenes is monumental.  There are so many quotable lines.

I fell in love with FORREST GUMP (metaphorically speaking, of course) the first time I saw it in the theater; I've enjoyed it numerous times since.  I suppose I have been intimidated to review it because this film leaves me challenged for words (and for me, that's saying something).  I attribute this to the ""simplistic complexity"" Tom Hanks brings to this unforgettable role--an oxymoron that sums up a lovable, mentally challenged Alabama man.Forrest Gump the character is slow, innocent, naive, honest, sincere, devoted, patient, loyal, and loving.  Hanks brings all these attributes to vivid life in his portrayal; again, he is able to portray a simple-minded man who happens to possess a wellspring of complexity.  Few actors, in my humble little opinion, would be able to pull such contrasts off, but Hanks triumphs, and he makes it look easy.Set in the South, FORREST GUMP is also a powerful critique of America in the mid-20th Century.  The film's agenda is decidedly left leaning as it depicts a status quo under duress from civil rights, to Vietnam, to political corruption, to corporate greed, to a declining culture.  Some of the criticism is on the mark, some of it over the top--but that's Hollywood.  Yet the film's darker political side is conquered by the unpretentious Forrest as he lives his life, seemingly oblivious to much of the ugliness surrounding him.FORREST GUMP is an exceptional, well-made film that looks good and feels good.  It sports a stellar supporting cast, including Sally Field, Gary Sinise, and Robin Wright Penn (to name but a few).  But Hanks is the consistent forte; the movie succeeds because the actor excels.Guess I wasn't at a loss for words, after all.--D.

I have a big problem with books being altered for movies, especially when they change the physical appearance and essence of the character.  They do that in this film, but I still make an exception because it took the character to new levels.  The book was funny and somewhat farcical, but that character was basically still a Southern hick.  This move adds a lot of dimension to this by showing the feelings this man has.But what I like most about the movie is that Forrest ultimately triumphs, but not because of his physical skills, or the amazing coincidences of his life.  He ultimately triumphs because of his basic decency.  His determination to do the right thing, and stick with those he believes in gives him his ultimate rewards.

It left quite an impression on me; I felt that I understood the phrase that said ""The world will never be the same once you've seen it through the eyes of Forrest Gump&quot;. And indeed I did, for a long period of time, I've had it's messages, and it's new-to-me way of looking at every day's life on my mind.

This doesn't mean it lacks amusing, funny and joyful moments,on the contrary.This not so common combination is what makes this film so great and recommended.

Sometimes I still reflect at Forrest running anywhere he wants to go, instead of walking, and ,my god I want to run to, or keep on running myself ! I can't forget his insane runs across the U.S. with all the nutcases joining him, this was brilliant !Another unforgettable scene was his second reunion (if I'm not mistaken) with Jenny in Washington D.C after nobody'd heard his speech ,but nevertheless used the `F' word.

126300,A7RM685PHBK20,0792140923,Eric,"[95, 114]","1994 featured the two most interesting central characters to ever grace the silver screen.  They were Andy Dufresne (The Shawshank Redemption) and Forrest Gump, played respectively by Tim Robbins and Tom Hanks.  Both films  from which the characters originate I consider to be in the top five best  movies of all time and it's the actors that makes the characters come to  life that makes the films so magnificent.Forrest Gump is a drama and a  comedy.  It tells the tale of a mildly retarded man who becomes involved  accidentally in the biggest events of the sixties, seventies, and eighties.  All throughout his life since he was a child, Forrest has been in love  with a girl named Jenny (Robin Wright Penn).  However, she refuses him only  because she loves him too much and doesn't want to hurt him.Underrated  by audiences, Forrest Gump is simply an amazing film.  I was surprised by  how hilarious and moving it was.  The film generates many big laughs that  involve how Forrest initiated and inspired many events in recent history  such as how he was the one who taught Elvis Presley to dance and the time  he unknowingly ratted on the Plumbers of Watergate.The performances are  what make this film memorable.  Tom Hanks gives one of the best leading  performances of the decade (and possibly of all time).  Coming in almost as  good is Gary Sinise as the misanthropic lieutenant whose life is changed  after becoming involved with Forrest in the shrimp business.  The  supporting cast which consists of Wright Penn, Sally Field, Mykelti  Williamson, and Haley Joel Osment (of Sixth Sense fame) also deliver good  performances.Forrest Gump is a great film that has to be seen to be  believed.  Cynics might find some problems with this film but they would  just be missing the entire point.  This is essentially a film about how the  most innocent and kind person on Earth has a low IQ and how he views the  world.

126302,A33Z8L75OXCP78,0792140923,Eric Schenk,"[23, 73]","This movie celebrates one of the worst possible perspectives on life and does it by exploiting all of the good will and energy of music of the Woodstock generation.  Think about it:  Tom Hanks portrays a pure innocent who presumably is to be seen as an American Buddha -- detached from everything except pure love.  Meanwhile, Robin Wright Penn is portrayed as an idiot because she invests herself in silly causes such as opposing the Vietnam War.  We are manipulated into sympathizing with the figure who remains utterly detached from life instead of the figure who cares about the world around her.Meanwhile, we are further manipulated by a soundtrack carefully assembled so as to have us associate all the good feelings and hopes connected to the songs with what we are watching:  a phenomenal bit of film making that successfully transposes the audiences associations with the highest ideals of the sixties and seventies on a film that belittles commitments to those beliefs.This is a truly insidious, reactionary piece of work.  At the end of the movie, ""Nashville,"" Robert Altman cleverly decries the ease by which an audience can be seduced into acquiescing to feel-good nihilism by having everyone leave the theater singing ""You may say that I ain't free, it don't worry me."" with gospel abandon.  The raves that the movie Forest Gump got proves Altman's point.No one can deny that this movie is a well made film with some sweet and wonderful performances.  But, at its core, it is spiritually bankrupt.

The screenplay is excellent but what makes this film work so well is how well it handles the other major aspects of film-making such as sound effects, cinematography, lighting let alone the usual acting and directing that most people are familiar with.  If you look at this film from a purely technical aspect, this on all accounts is an excellent film and will certainly age very well over the years.

We were impressed, touched, and moved by it equally. We laughed, we could not contain tears, and we lived together with the hero, the childlike, naive, and innocent Forrest Gump, the most unusual lead character you can think of. FG was a big hit when it was released, and it went on to receive 6 Oscars including for The Best Picture, Director, Best Actor, Best Visual Effects, and Best Screen Play. The film's Oscar status has made it one of the controversial choices among the film viewers. Some completely agree that FG deserved all its awards and its love. The others, and quite few to that believe that the film is totally overrated, sickly sweet, and it is nothing more than the American propaganda of mediocrity. They believe that the film's main idea is, follow the orders, do what you are told, and even if your intellect is low or almost non-existent, with a little bit of luck, you would achieve the success in your life and even would change the history by simply being at the right place in the right time. How wrong I believe they are. You can't think of Forrest Gump as a real person. He is a fairy tale character, or rather the embodiment of a human with no cynicism whatsoever, the candid, pure, innocent man who is not quick or witty but who knows bad from good and right from wrong and through whose eyes we see the historical events in the live of this country for about thirty years of the last Century. Forrest may not be an intellectual prodigy but he was led through life's hardships, by the inner moral compass if you will and he knows the very simple truths that he never misses - love and loyalty to his mother, his friends, the girl he loves and his Country.The movie covers the look at America not only from Forrest's point of view. Another look at alternative, rebellious, counterculture America was very well presented through Jenny's life. Between them two, I believe the film's creators were able to show the changing times and changing face of this country. Technically and visually, the film is a marvel. The best songs of the time that were used in the film soundtrack are great and I don't mind them sound almost all the time -the more the better. Tom Hanks had achieved the very difficult task. His Forrest is simple but not laughable. He is a decent and very good man. It is not easy to create such idealistic character and to make him alive and sympathetic. There is not a single false note in Hanks' performance, and he absolutely deserves the Oscar.When I rewathed the film recently, it touched me as deeply now as it did 15 years ago, and this is for me the sign of not just good but a great movie.

126318,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,0792140923,General Breadbasket,"[6, 6]","Forrest Gump, based more or less on the novel of the same name by Winston Groom, is my second favorite film of all time. It always manages to cheer me up, or make me laugh, or make me think. Plus I love all the retro footage and sets, being a big fan of all things 1960s and 1970s.Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is a young man who isn't that smart, but still has gone on to lead an interesting life. His life leads him to all sorts of places, and he gets to meet all sorts of people, some of them celebrities of the day. He goes to college, he goes to war, he goes on TV and even to China. He loves his mama (Sally Field) and a girl named Jenny, who he has known since the first day of school (Robin Wright Penn). Sometimes it seems as if he has a destiny, other times its like he's floating round on the breeze. Maybe it's both. Whichever way, it certainly makes an interesting ride.There are so many things I love about this film. I love the character of Forrest, the way he looks at things, the way he talks and interacts with people. I love the soundtrack, a mix of songs contemporary with Forrest's adventures in the 1960s and 1970s. They really add to the mood of the film, plus usually are relevant lyrically, which is a nice touch, I thought. I love the look of everything in the film, which helps the atmosphere just as much as the music. I love how this movie can make me laugh, make my cry and make me think. I love how there's always something thematically I haven't noticed before. Though it's about a not so clever man, I do believe it's a very clever film.Since I love the film so much, I find the special features really interesting.

From a sheer entertainment standpoint the film isn't too bad, at first.  Forrest goes on adventures, they are passably amusing.  The second half of the film is incredibly dull and all that sh*t with his stupid hippie loser girlfriend is unbearable. Also, though there's no denying that Hanks is an extremely good actor I'm not especially impressed with his performance here.  Everyone seems to think that affected, gimmicky performances are the most impressive thing, but I don't buy it.  Hell back in 6th grade there was this semi-retarded chick that I used to imitate for my friends and lemme tell ya my performance was spot on AND hilarious. Gimmie an Oscar, I rule the acting I do.But what I really hate about this movie is how it's such a major example of the baby boom generations love affair with itself.  Chuck Klosterman summed up the problems with them pretty neatly and I'm gonna quote him as best I can from memory: 'Baby Boomers are convinced that they are the most important generation ever.  THEY ended the war, THEY had things they believed in.  There is nothing more pompous and condescending than a nostalgic baby boomer.' I wish I had the exact quote, but that's the gist of it, and he goes on to note how baby boomers are obsessed with how revolutionary they are and yet they inherited the establishment and ended up keeping pretty much everything the same.  And it's not just that it's about the generation.  That's not necessarily a problem it just reeks of the whole 'God are we amazing attitude'.  I've heard it all before and I'm not interested.

126327,A1CIW2OEVAJRM2,0792140923,Godly Gadfly,"[11, 40]","Forrest Gump is the story of the life of a retarded man who lives through epic events in American history: JFK, Nixon, Vietnam War, etc.  His life touches most of these significant ways, such as by accidentally discovering Watergate.  He becomes famous after rescuing several soldiers in the Vietnam War, and achieving remarkable success in international ping pong.  But his heart's desire is his childhood friend Jenny, who is one of the few who shows compassion to him.The insight into the life of a retarded man is wonderful.  And the acting, particularly of Tom Hanks in acting Forrest Gump, is remarkable.  Some of the special effects (eg the ping pong playing, the inclusion of Forrest Gump in real newscasts of US presidents, John Lennon, etc) are astounding.  The DVD features an explanation of how these special effects were accomplished, and they truly are outstanding.  The concept is great, but the way it is worked out is a typical Hollywood disappointment.Because these are the only positives about the movie.  Several concerns:1. Adult themes.  The rating is only PG 13, but there are many scenes with violence, drugs, nudity and sex, themes inappropriate for children.  The language is mostly reasonable, but there are multiple incidences of strong blasphemy and foul language.2. Lack of moral absolutes.  Forrest Gump represents innocence and naivity, but yet he is corrupted by Jenny, whom he eventually sleeps with.  Even after he fathers her child outside of wedlock, she assures him that he has done nothing wrong. Jenny's death is apparently due to her lifestyle (due to her drug problems, STDs or AIDS?), and yet the dangerous consequences of an ungodly lifestyle are never connected or clearly spelled out.  She seems to represent all the dangerous things of the sixties.3. Atheism.  Gump is one of the few individuals who believes in God, but this is presented as part of his retarded thinking, which like in other areas, is out of date and inaccurate.  This is especially clear in a blasphemous scene where his friend challenges God to sink his boat.  As it turns out, God loses, because every boat is sunk except theirs, and they become millionaires as a result.  Christianity is clearly presented as irrelevant for modern life.4. Self-determinism.  The movie starts and ends with a fluttering feather.  It's a very religious symbol, as the movie itself explains with several discussions about ""destiny"".  Destiny is partly the random fluttering of fate, and what you make of it yourself.  Forrest partly triumphs by his character, but also the whims of fate (eg the success of his shrimping company is pure ""chance"" after all other boats sink).  God's involvement in the world is clearly rejected in favour of self-determinism.  This is a strong theme in the movie, and a dangerous one.5. Trivialization.  Key events of American history are presented through Gump's eyes.  While it gives insight into a retarded man, at the same time these key events are downplayed and presented as trite and almost laughable.  Some of the most important and emotional events of the 20th century are trivialized.  This reflects the failure of most Americans to treat life with the seriousness it deserves.All in all, while this movie had aspects of warm humour, it also showed the spiritual bankruptcy of a modern America that has rejected God and is no longer rooted to moral absolutes.  The fact that this was awarded the Best Picture in 1993 and received a bag-load of Academy Awards just proves that it is indeed representative of modern thinking.  Interestingly some critics believe that this movie is an attack on liberalism, lambasting promiscuity, atheism, and the entire counter-culture of the 60s.  I wish it was, but the very fact of its immense popularity among modern viewers suggests that - sadly - this is not the case.  It's a sad reflection of modern American, and its popularity just confirms how accurate this portrait really is.",2,Typical Hollywood.

It just seemed like an excuse to play a lot of songs from the 1960's, and for baby boomers to reminisce about historical events in their lives (of which Gump was at all of them).  Why this won so many awards is highly questionable.  The only reason I can think of is that it's easy and not too controversial; it's the safe choice.  The Academy has been known to do that (remember the Crash and Brokeback Mountain controversy?).  Tom Hanks really didn't deserve an Academy Award here, not that he isn't a fine actor (he is), but because the performance is not particularly challenging.

I gave it my fourth watch and well, to say I'm gutted would be an understatement. Have I ever loved a movie character as much as that of Forrest Gump? No.Silence has been used well, the silence in the eyes of Forrest Gump. There's something rather powerful about his expressionless face. It can emote comedy, unconventional charisma but above all, a deep sense of sadness. I know this a rather bold statement that would raise a lot of argument but just for the sake of Forrest Gump and my love for this film, I can safely be abrasive and say Tom Hanks gave the best performance for a male ever in a lead role.I do not know whether I should commend the direction, or the screenplay, or the background music and screenplay because all I remember of when I think of this film, is Tom Hanks and that look on his face.Forrest Gump is special. In a wierd way,I would like to think every movie watcher relates to this story. It also manages to nail all emotions. When I watched this film for the first time, I thought about it for a week. With every new person, I meet in my daily life, or date, there always is a conversation about forrest gump. And I like mentioning to them how I lock my doors while watching this film because I wouldnt want anybody rushing to see me.The awkwardness in his actions, is similar to that of the character Edward (played by Depp) in a film called Edward Scissorhands. The humor is compareable to the great Stan Laurel. The way he cries,speaks,runs,gestures a hello, gestures a goodbye is HIS own. People of my age often talk about characters in films like Godfather(Pacino,Brando), Fight Club (pitt), XXX (Diesel), Rocky (Stallone) ,etc. They forget the quiet man with an odd face and the kindest of the simplest of expressions in Forrest Gump. I'm not sorry if you disagree with me, but the character of Forrest Gump owns all.My favourite scenes from this film - Forrest says to Jenny ""Cause you're my girl"" , Forrest turns around to people running behind him and says ""I'm pretty tired, I think I'll go home now"", Forrest playing ping pong, Lieutenant Dan v/s God (storm), Bubba talking about shrimps, Forrest asking little Forrest what he's watching and sitting beside him, all scenes involving him running.I criticisize the Americans a lot but this is one of the most American films I have seen and it stands as the most perfect,too.

126349,AMF5LHI9IOIH1,0792140923,Irishgirl,"[5, 6]","Wow, this is one of my all-time favorite films and in my opinion, one of the best made. I remember when this movie first came out and my mom, grandmother and I went to see it in the theatres. Being a very young teen at the time (around 13), there were some things about the film that I missed or didn't quite understand, but I nevertheless loved it. As the years went by, I watched it several times and it got better and better. It's one of those timeless movies that should be put in a time capsule. ""Forrest Gump"" was the winner of ""Best Film"" in 1994. I still can't believe it's been 13 years since this movie came out. Everyone at my junior high at the time loved the film and even voted it as their favorite for 1994. There was even a popular guy at school whose nickname became ""Gump."" There was quite a ""Forrest Gump"" craze after the movie came out, from ""Bubba Gump"" shrimp hats and shirts, to cookbooks, to Gump documentary books. The movie spawned popular phrases such as ""Stupid is as stupid does,"" ""Life is like a box of chocolates....you never know what you're gonna get,"" ""Sometimes there just aren't enough rocks"" and ""We was like peas and carrots.""For those of us like me, who never grew up in the 1950's and 60's, ""Forrest Gump"" is the perfect way to lead you through a decade of some of the most important events and people of that time. We see these events through the eyes and life of Forrest Gump, as this extraordinary man seems to come across some pretty historical marks just by living his innocent life. Imagine meeting Elvis Presley in your own home, or sitting next to the likes of John Lennon? Tom Hanks (one of the best actors you could watch and one of my all-time favorites), plays Forrest Gump, a challenged man with a rather low IQ who has always been subject to discrimination since he was a boy. His adoring mother, played by Sally Field (another one of my very favorite actresses and one of the best around), with her gentle personality, is always there to remind Forrest that he's no different, and refuses to let anyone treat him differently. The only person other than his mother who accepts Forrest is Jenny, an innocent girl with her own demons at home, whom he met on the bus as a boy. Together, they grew up and even though they led separate lives, they still remained close and had a good relationship. Forrest played football for Alabama and got to meet President John F. Kennedy. In Vietnam where he endures the hardships of war, he befriends a challenged, shrimp-obsessed soldier named Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) and a rough talking, bitter Lieutenant named Dan Taylor (a magnificent and intensely real performance from Gary Sinise). And he gets a special medal from President Lyndon Johnson after some heroic efforts during the war. Oh, and he also becomes an expert ping pong player, a shrimp boat captain, a witness to Watergate and he makes a seemingly tireless run across the states gaining faithful followers along the way. Jenny (a stunning performance from Robin Wright) meanwhile, has become a bit of a drifter and a druggie, hanging around with the likes of hippies and men who enjoy beating women. She frequents clubs, sells her body and plays folk music. Though she and Forrest's worlds seem to lead in totally different directions, they still seem to find their way to each other. And keep your eyes open for a very young Haily-Joel Osment who plays Forrest's little boy.""Forrest Gump"" is both a comedy and a drama. It has a lot of everything in it from the poignant, emotional scene of Jenny throwing rocks at her childhood home where she was abused, to Forrest showing his buttocks battle wound to President Lyndon Johnson, to Jenny's fight with a terminal illness, to Forrest's bulldozing over of the Alabama cheerleaders in the endzone after his touchdown run. This film is all about destiny and handling that destiny no matter what the outcome of each event is. It's a story of heroism and loyalty, of love and acceptance, of trial and error. It's about tackling complexity with simplicity. There is so much going on in this film that I could write a novel about it. It covers so much ground; such huge events from the past as seen through rather innocent eyes. Forrest seems to tackle each challenge in life with his innocent ease and is the type of person who just takes it like it is; just do it and don't turn back. This film has so much to offer that it truly begs you not to become engrossed. And the acting is so real, you feel like you're in the film. It is a great ""period"" film, as you can see all the styles from the times; the peace signs, the side-burns, the cars, the old south. Everything is captured so nicely. And the film has extraordinary special effects that involve real footage from the time period wrapped around Tom Hanks as Gump. You can see how all the special features were done on the second disc ""Behind the Magic of Forrest Gump;"" a disc loaded with extras including screen tests, the making of the film and how they wanted it to appear, all the work to do the props, all the special effects with amazing computer technology, how the makeup was done, and on and on. They cover just about everything. And of course, I must mention the soundtrack, which I believe is a two CD set since there is so much. There are awesome tunes from the war period of the sixties such as ""Turn! Turn! Turn!"" by The Byrds, ""California Dreamin'"" from The Mamas and The Papas, and ""Fortunate Son"" by Creedence Clearwater Revival. Later on into the late 70's and early 80's, we hear such hits as The Doobie Brothers' ""It Keeps You Running,"" Fleetwood Mac's ""Go Your Own Way"" and Bob Segar and The Silver Bullet Band's ""Against The Wind.""Okay sooooo my fingers are out of breath. I have to stop. Can't speak enough of this great film with all the trimmings you could want. Director Robert Zemeckis is brilliant! A good movie? Hardly. An all-time classic?

Forrest Gump is dumb, yet he is extraordinarily persistent and virtuous. His character strengths allows him to achieve extraordinary deeds, such as becoming a world class ping pong player, a famous marathon runner, and a war hero.The antithesis of Forrest is an intelligent Berkley anti-War student. He is against the Vietname War because it violates his conscience. He also beats his girlfriend and is the antagonist of the movie.Why protest a war which the historians will conclude as the most indefensible in American History? Be like Forrest, don't think, and just do as authorities tell you, even if it means killing others. The fact this movie came out in mid-90s when the Vietnam War had all but been condemned as an unneccessary mistake makes this point even more disturbing.To be sure, Gary Sinese played a pivotal role of glorifying those who heroically sacrificed in Vietnam. But I felt the anti-war protesters should have been given their credit for the sacrifices they made in the name of justice and humanity.Americans should never strive to be like Forrest. Being dumb and ignorant is not a virtue. Blind submission to authorities will often lead to demise of the freedom and democracy in the society.

Only the hardest heart will fail to be moved by its emotional crescendos, of which there are many.  Several scenes have become American film classics, emblazed in our consciousness.  Also in praise, Tom Hanks does a fine job as Forrest, who embodies many of the qualities most prized in the United States; honesty, loyalty, and courage. There is, however, a seamy underside to the movie and it is this message: it is better to be a half wit, oblivious to the vagaries of reality; than to understand what is going on and be corrupted by the resulting despair.  To drive home this message, we are presented the parallel lives of Forrest, the innocent, and that of his lifelong love, Jenny.While Forrest valiantly serves in a war he does not understand, Jenny proceeds down the path of the anti-government reactionary of the 1960s.  We are invited to believe that Jenny takes this path in part because she was abused as a child, and we see her devolve slowly into anti-Vietnam protest, partying with the Black Panthers, drug abuse, suicidal tendencies, and perhaps worst of all, sexual promiscuity with unsuitable men.  AIDS is her punishment for wandering off the moral reservation, for Jenny is the anti-Forrest, a morally conscientious yet wholly immoral liberal.  In case the message is lost on you, the paths of Jenny and Forrest cross throughout the movie, and the audience can only conclude at every meeting that Jenny should forego the social conscientiousness, and retire to the plantation house with Forrest to enjoy a simple life.  Yet Jenny refuses to be saved, and the religious parallels are obvious.America follows the path of Jenny- her turbulence matches that of the political period.  But we are invited to wonder whether or not if we as a country would be better off as Forrest- perhaps chastity and innocence engender honesty, loyalty, courage, and the ability to be remarkable.  The only expense, however, is our intelligence, or at the least, a renouncement of ideological responsibility, an idea that is wholly discomforting.",4,"Good, but somewhat disturbing",1105574400,"01 13, 2005",2005,2097,"['Forrest', 'Gump', 'doubt', 'effective', 'film', 'Only', 'hardest', 'heart', 'will', 'fail', 'be', 'moved', 'emotional', 'crescendos', 'are', 'many', 'Several', 'scenes', 'have', 'become', 'American', 'film', 'classics', 'emblazed', 'consciousness', 'Also', 'praise', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'fine', 'job', 'Forrest', 'who', 'many', 'qualities', 'most', 'prized', 'United', 'States', 'honesty', 'loyalty', 'courage', 'however', 'seamy', 'underside', 'movie', 'message', 'better', 'be', 'half', 'wit', 'oblivious', 'vagaries', 'reality', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'be', 'corrupted', 'resulting', 'despair', 'drive', 'home', 'message', 'are', 'presented', 'parallel', 'lives', 'Forrest', 'innocent', 'lifelong', 'love', 'Jenny.While', 'Forrest', 'valiantly', 'war', 'not', 'understand', 'Jenny', 'down', 'path', 'anti-government', 'reactionary', '1960s', 'are', 'invited', 'believe', 'Jenny', 'path', 'part', 'was', 'abused', 'child', 'see', 'devolve', 'slowly', 'anti-Vietnam', 'protest', 'partying', 'Black', 'Panthers', 'drug', 'abuse', 'suicidal', 'tendencies', 'perhaps', 'worst', 'sexual', 'promiscuity', 'unsuitable', 'men', 'AIDS', 'punishment', 'wandering', 'off', 'moral', 'reservation', 'Jenny', 'anti-Forrest', 'morally', 'conscientious', 'yet', 'wholly', 'immoral', 'liberal', 'case', 'message', 'lost', 'paths', 'Jenny', 'Forrest', 'cross', 'movie', 'audience', 'can', 'only', 'conclude', 'meeting', 'Jenny', 'should', 'forego', 'social', 'conscientiousness', 'retire', 'plantation', 'house', 'Forrest', 'enjoy', 'simple', 'life', 'Jenny', 'refuses', 'be', 'saved', 'religious', 'parallels', 'are', 'obvious.America', 'path', 'Jenny-', 'turbulence', 'matches', 'political', 'period', 'are', 'invited', 'wonder', 'not', 'country', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'Forrest-', 'perhaps', 'chastity', 'innocence', 'engender', 'honesty', 'loyalty', 'courage', 'ability', 'be', 'remarkable', 'only', 'expense', 'however', 'intelligence', 'least', 'renouncement', 'ideological', 'responsibility', 'idea', 'wholly', 'discomforting']",N/A

That scene in a nutshell captures the mentality of the film; it is one of a hundred scenes very much like it.Quite simply, ""Forrest Gump"" is two hours of non-stop tugging at the viewer's  heartstrings.  Like the comedy that throws non-stop jokes at the viewer without any meaningful cohesion, it stops working after a while.Now to give the devil his due: you will enjoy this movie in spite of how dumb it is.  Three stars.  It's fun.  Gump is a sympathetic character whom you will want to see succeed.  The film is fairly funny. The movie REALLY gets carried away, however, when this boob's achievement level goes through the roof.  The viewer is left scratching his head in bewilderment. Which brings up an interesting point: what is the point of this movie?  Plain and simple - it is to exalt the superiority of the lowly over the mighty.  I've spoken with several people who find that very inspiring.  I don't.This is NOT one of the best movies ever.  It's not even particularly good.  That movies like this and ""Titanic"" win the Best Film award on Oscar night only goes to show how ridiculous the Academy Awards really are.  Still, it's not a bad way of spending an evening, even if just to be able to perfect your dead-on impression of the lame-brained main character.  (Mine is quite good.)

126365,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,0792140923,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[7, 8]","Once in a great while, a movie comes along that captures your heart and imagination.  Forrest Gump is one of those rare movies.  Led by an all-star cast including Tom Hanks (Forrest), Robin Wright Penn (Jenny), Gary Sinise (Lt. Dan), and Sally Field (Mrs. Gump), the viewer is treated to a view of Americana through the eyes of a simple young country boy.Through three turbulent decades, the movie describes events that were capturing headlines throughout the United States, as told through Forrest's eyes.  The viewer gets a unique look at such events as racial segregation, physical disability, war protests, and the onset of AIDS.  Through Forrest's unique perspective, the viewer is shown each of these controversial topics.The viewer also gets to see the ups and downs of Forrest's relationship with Jenny over the years.  From young children riding a school bus together to facing the uncertainty of AIDS, a lifelong bond is shared between them. Although leading very different lives, Forrest's love for Jenny never waivers, and in the end, Jenny finally realizes that she is ment to be with Forrest.The scenes in Vietnam are some of my favorites.  Gary Sinese's portrayal of Lt. Dan Taylor is simply perfect.  A by-the-book soldier who teaches Forrest how to stay alive, it is ultimately Forrest who saves Lt. Dan's life (over his protests) during an enemy ambush.  Forced to have both legs amputated, Lt. Dan slips into a life of alcohol and self-doubt, but Forrest remains his true friend, and after buying a shrimping boat, Lt. Dan joins Forrest as his ""first mate"".  It is here that Lt. Dan finally thanks Forrest for saving his life.The most touching scene of the movie is near the end where Forrest is speaking to Jenny at her gravesite.  Forrest tells Jenny how much he loves and misses her, all the while gently crying.  He also explains to her how proud he is of their son Forrest Jr.  In the end, Forrest and Forrest Jr. are waiting for the school bus, just like Forrest and his mother used to.I would give this movie six stars if I could.  Tom Hanks won an academy award for his portrayal of Forrest, while Robert Zemeckis also won for best director.  Simply put, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  The acting is impeccable, and the viewer gets an interesting history lesson about life in the United States during the 60s, 70s, and early 80s.  I give this film my highest recommendation.

Don't people like you understand that there is not always a necessity for complex messages? The message is simple, like Forrest Gump himself: &quot;Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.&quot; Such wisdom, because it represents the sponaneoity and mystery of life.  We need more people like Forrest. Sure, he's simpleminded, but he has a huge heart. And I stress &quot;HUGE&quot;. He doesn't care what anyone thinks of him-because he doesn't know the difference, but that's what makes him so likable, because he can adapt easily under any kind of circumstance. He is never mean, stands up for the people he loves, has more determination than any one I've ever seen. He has such love, and he doesn't hold it all in. He is honest, but not insulting. There are more than enough scenes to show that Forrest is a rare spirit. Such as the little scene most people seem to have overlooked- the one when two black students are accepted into an all-white school and one of them drops her book while entering the building, and Forrest runs up to her and hands her the book. Who else would have had the chutzpah to do that? He also gives up a whole load of money to buy a shrimping boat, just because he promised his best friend who died in combat that they would have a boat someday. Most people might find this ludicrous, but I found it unbelievable. I, for one, would have never done that. And he's so modest about it, too- a quality that most people do not possess.  He is also overcome by compassion and love for his best friend, Jenny. I was asking the exact same question myself when Jenny said to Forrest: &quot;Why are you so good to me, Forrest?&quot; Jenny leaves him a number of times during the movie, but unlike many people, Forrest doesn't become hateful and bitter. He just keeps on thinking about her and loving her.Forrest, a simple minded man, with an I.Q. of 75, holds the key to all noble, shining parts of life.

For those who dont think it is the greatest it has to rank in the top 10 right? Well to me this is a pure cinematic masterpiece in every aspect, from the great cast(Hanks, Fields, Wright, Sinise), the great storyline, the camera work and great directing from Robert Zimeckis. There are also so many memorable quotes in this movie that today, 10 years later I still remember and quote lines from it like &quot;Life is like a box of chocolates...&quot;Forrest Gump is the story of a man that is not very bright but still he sees the world in a way few others ever have or will. We see the progression from the young Forrest who barely makes it into a normal school and is constantly bullied by his peers, to the man who had come to experience so much in life like being on a national champion football team, meeting the president, serving in Vietnam and starting his own shrimping business. Along the way he meets some interesting characters such as Jenny whom he loves his whole life but she follows the wrong path in life, and his best friend Bubba. Bubba was his best friend in the world, and they planned on a partnership in the shrimping business since Bubba's family had always been in that business. You see real emotions that life brings when Bubba dies in Vietnam, when his mother and Jenny die, and when he learns he has a son, Forrest Jr. Forrest lives life to the fullest and I think it is a great message because someone may be considered to be slow but that doesnt mean they can't accomplish so many things in life.The dvd is great and truly does this movie right. The extras are very good like the commentaries and deleted scenes, but to be honest I have not watched all that disc 2 has to offer.

126377,A1Y6CE9HHZVBDP,0792140923,"""jhunsel""","[2, 2]","I've watched Forrest Gump for the first time since its initial theatrical release and was quickly reminded just how great a film it really is. The film itself has been critiqued many times, so I will instead concentrate on the DVD contents and presentation, as usual.Disc 1 contains the movie as well as two different running commentaries. The first commentary by director Robert Zemeckis, producer Steve Starkey and production designer Rick Carter is full of details and never lags, but I couldn't escape the feeling that I wish that they had answered a few more questions about specific scenes, etc. That's not to say that they didn't divulge interesting information about the making of the film, or that I didn't enjoy it, but I expected a bit more from a commentary by three people. The second commentary is by producer Wendy Finerman, and is fairly insightful. There are a few extended moments of dead air, but for the most part she offers information about characters, their development and the subtle visual and verbal cues used to convey that growth. She occasionally resorts to describing the action on the screen and stays away from the technical info of the first commentary, but provides a nice analysis of the film's emotional undercurrents.Disc 2 contains most of the good stuff about the production that was omitted from the commentaries, and as I felt with Zemeckis's Cast Away DVD collection, it was probably planned that way so as not to be redundant. The &quot;documentary,&quot; Through the Eyes of Forrest Gump, is actually just a promotional fluff piece that was also included on the original laserdisc. There are a couple of screen tests which only underscore the acting abilities of Tom Hanks and Robin Wright, as well as some great breakdowns of makeup, sound and production design. An extended section on visual effects is the centerpiece of the second disc and includes some unfinished deleted scenes and disections that are very informative and entertaining. As Zemeckis says in his commentary, if you notice the effects, then he hasn't done his job, and as with Cast Away, you'll be surprised just how often visual effects were used besides in the obvious circumstances.All in all, this is a good, thorough DVD package. It's not quite as good as some (Fox's &quot;Five Star Collection&quot;), but better than most.

Kennedy through the L.B.J. and Nixon administrations and beyond. Much of the early movie is comic. At the beginning and end of the movie we see Forest waiting and a feather floating through the air: life goes on, the circle of life persists and endures. Forrest, mentally challenged, learns to run like a house afire to get away from his enemies and his demons.Through a groundbreaking process we see Forrest's image merged with the real images on newsreel footage of the American presidents he meets. He isn't greatly impressed by famous people, fame for himself or money. He's loving, extremely loyal, kind, gentle, nave, trusting, courageous, and a lot smarter about life than most of the people around him.Tom Hanks, the quintessential American movie star of the last thirty years, does a fantastic job as Forrest. The movie is full of adages and sayings (like ""stupid is as stupid does"") that Forrest repeats and lives by. He and his mother (Sally Fields) have a deep connection, and he has one love in his life, his childhood sweetheart, Jennie. She's a sixties love child who deeply disappoints Forrest by becoming part of the 60's and 70's drug culture, but their love triumphs.Because of his ability to outrun everybody, Forest Gump becomes a football star and an accidental hero in the Vietnam War saving Bubba Blue, the shrimp fisherman he's befriended. He also saves Lieutenant Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise) who eventually becomes his business partner and life-long friend. He goes into Bubba's shrimp business after the Vietnam War, and he becomes successful along with Lieutenant Dan.The movie reaches into pathos, but it can be excused for those excesses.

Has half the population been deprived of a pleasure that us daydreamers like to call ""fantasy""?  Sure, you might expect a film in the drama section of your video store to not be so idealistic and goofy, but it's not the filmmakers' fault this film is in the drama section.  You COULD put this in the comedy section, the fantasy section (if your video store has one), the FAMILY section, or even the ACTION/adventure section.The fact of the matter is that if you can stop nitpicking at the film while you're supposed to be enjoying it (in other words, commit the ""horrendeous"" deed of ""suspending belief"" which I think is a stupid term 'cause movies are almost always dramatised to the extent of fantasy and they shouldn't be taken seriously, since even the most realistic films are quite trivial when you look at the big scheme of life), you will find that this film is the most extreme tearjerker b/c of its heart-pounding idealism and romance.  All throughout the film I couldn't keep from shedding a tear of...well, I don't know why I cried through so much of the film...I guess the previous statement would explain it better.The simple fact of the matter is if you loved Mean Streets (the Scorsese film that pre-dates Taxi Driver) you probably won't like this film.  If you've never seen Mean Streets, then whatever.  I personally wasn't able to watch the majority of Mean Streets, so I think it makes sense that I liked this film.  The visuals are creative and lushious, and the story brings to mind a gigantic field of flowers.  In lamen's terms, it's pure fantasy!Also, on a little bit of a different note, I should say that in all scientificness (unless your view of science is based on cynicism), the story COULD happen!!!  It is not entirely impossible for a simple-minded man to experience several pieces of history and become a multiply-talented celebrity.  It doesn't happen most of the time, if at all, but it COULD happen!!!  Also, Tom Hanks is not ""going for the cheese"".  He simply recognizes good screenwriting when he sees it.

There are inspired notes--I still enjoy the sequence where Forrest runs  across America several times--but they are outweighed by bad puns and  clunking dialogue.  Forrest stupidly showing his rear end to LBJ, or  serving as the inspiration for John Lennon's song &quot;Imagine&quot;, or  telling Jack Kennedy that he needs to evacuate his blatter--these things  are no longer amusing.  The film has lost its lustre.

Certain scenes are astounding acheivements - especially the editing of monumental historical moments that put Forrest front and center.  Yet, where is the movie's heart?  Personally, I found it in Sally Field's performance as Gump's mother, and in Gary Sinise's terrific Oscar-worthy moments as his platoon leader.  Overall, the movie really asks an awful lot from its audience - you must suspend all semblence of time and space, reality and history in order to be taken away.

Most movies are about the bravest, the strongest, and the most beautiful / handsome as they plow through their lives. In Forrest Gump, Tom Hanks is instead a man who has many challenges in life. His legs won't work properly. He is not smart enough to be allowed in a traditional school. But through the perseverence of his loving, single mother, he gets the foundation in life, the moral strength, and the perseverence to thrive.Forrest absolutely does not have an ""easy life"". His mother was abandoned by her husband and runs a boarding house. She pours all her love and dedication into raising her son to be able to take care of himself and to be content. She sleeps with the school's principle when he tells her that Forrest can't go to school. She tells Forrest repeatedly that he is just as good as anyone else, and that life is unpredictable and that that is normal. The line in the movie is: ""Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."" It's become so popular that it is now almost cliche. It's important to remember that it GOT popular because so many people relate to its meaning. You might like the flavor of a chocolate, or dislike it, but it's all part of life, and you go on and have another one.Hanks shines in this, as does Sinise, and both are well deserving of the many awards they won. Forrest is not one dimensional. Yes, he is not a genius. But he is still a complex character. When Jenny turns down his marriage proposal, he stares at her for a moment, then tells her, ""I may not be a smart man, but I know what love is."" With the conviction in his voice, and the emotion in his face, you know absolutely that he does.Some of the movie is a bit heavy-handed. The repeated insertions of Gump into seemingly every single important moment in American history - including teaching Elvis how to dance, meeting with multiple presidents, and so on, can seem a bit much. He invented the smiley face. He happened to invest in Apple. The music soundtrack suffers from this ""club on the head"" issue. When Jenny leaves an abusive boyfriend, the sountrack sings ""don't you love her madly as she's walking out the door"" just as she does.But then there are moments when I am powerfully affected, every time I see this movie. When Jenny was little, her father abused her. Forrest doesn't quite understand this, but later in life when they're both adults they return to her childhood home. Jenny starts throwing rocks at the house, furious at what her father had done, and then collapses. Forrest feels her pain, and says, ""Sometimes, I guess there just aren't enough rocks"". He knows exactly what she's going through, inside, and gets to the core of the emotion.It is a bit sad that, even though the two most important people in his life are his mother and Jenny, the two never interact at all. And those two women never seem to interact with any other women. So this movie is all about Forrest, all his male friends, and then the men around his mother and Jenny. So we have an entire movie full of men and then ""the mom"" and ""the love"". I would have appreciated greatly a more rich world.But, still, this is a problem with just about every movie, so it's hard to fault Forrest Gump too much for this flaw. And the movie does embrace a wealth of issues. Dan deals with life with no lower legs. Forrest deals with his mental challenges. Jenny is a survivor of child abuse. Forrest's mom struggles as a poor single mom. Together they all make it through their challenges.Well recommended.",5,A Different View of Life,1342569600,"07 18, 2012",2012,3684,"['world', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'are', 'cookie-cutter', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'out', 'having', 'very', 'distinct', 'storyline', 'rarely', 'found', 'elsewhere', 'Most', 'movies', 'are', 'bravest', 'strongest', 'most', 'beautiful', '/', 'handsome', 'plow', 'lives', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'instead', 'man', 'who', 'many', 'challenges', 'life', 'legs', 'wo', ""n't"", 'work', 'properly', 'not', 'smart', 'enough', 'be', 'allowed', 'traditional', 'school', 'perseverence', 'loving', 'single', 'mother', 'foundation', 'life', 'moral', 'strength', 'perseverence', 'thrive.Forrest', 'absolutely', 'not', 'have', 'easy', 'life', 'mother', 'was', 'abandoned', 'husband', 'boarding', 'house', 'love', 'dedication', 'raising', 'son', 'be', 'able', 'take', 'care', 'be', 'content', 'school', 'principle', 'when', 'Forrest', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'school', 'Forrest', 'repeatedly', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'anyone', 'else', 'life', 'unpredictable', 'normal', 'line', 'movie', 'Mama', 'always', 'said', 'life', 'was', 'box', 'chocolates', 'never', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'gon', 'get', 'become', 'so', 'popular', 'now', 'almost', 'cliche', 'important', 'remember', 'GOT', 'popular', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'relate', 'meaning', 'might', 'like', 'flavor', 'chocolate', 'dislike', 'part', 'life', 'go', 'have', 'one.Hanks', 'shines', 'Sinise', 'are', 'well', 'deserving', 'many', 'awards', 'won', 'Forrest', 'not', 'one', 'dimensional', 'Yes', 'not', 'genius', 'still', 'complex', 'character', 'When', 'Jenny', 'down', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'moment', 'then', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'smart', 'man', 'know', 'what', 'love', 'conviction', 'voice', 'emotion', 'face', 'know', 'absolutely', 'movie', 'bit', 'heavy-handed', 'repeated', 'insertions', 'Gump', 'seemingly', 'single', 'important', 'moment', 'American', 'history', 'including', 'teaching', 'Elvis', 'how', 'dance', 'meeting', 'multiple', 'presidents', 'so', 'can', 'seem', 'bit', 'much', 'invented', 'smiley', 'face', 'happened', 'invest', 'Apple', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'suffers', 'club', 'head', 'issue', 'When', 'Jenny', 'abusive', 'boyfriend', 'sountrack', 'sings', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'madly', 'walking', 'out', 'door', 'just', 'then', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'am', 'powerfully', 'affected', 'time', 'see', 'movie', 'When', 'Jenny', 'was', 'little', 'father', 'abused', 'Forrest', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'later', 'life', 'when', ""'re"", 'adults', 'return', 'childhood', 'home', 'Jenny', 'throwing', 'rocks', 'house', 'furious', 'what', 'father', 'had', 'done', 'then', 'collapses', 'Forrest', 'pain', 'Sometimes', 'guess', 'there', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'rocks', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'inside', 'core', 'emotion.It', 'bit', 'sad', 'even', 'two', 'most', 'important', 'people', 'life', 'are', 'mother', 'Jenny', 'two', 'never', 'interact', 'two', 'women', 'never', 'seem', 'interact', 'other', 'women', 'movie', 'Forrest', 'male', 'friends', 'then', 'men', 'mother', 'Jenny', 'have', 'entire', 'movie', 'full', 'men', 'then', 'mom', 'love', 'would', 'have', 'appreciated', 'greatly', 'more', 'rich', 'world.But', 'still', 'problem', 'just', 'movie', 'hard', 'fault', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'too', 'much', 'flaw', 'movie', 'embrace', 'wealth', 'issues', 'Dan', 'deals', 'life', 'lower', 'legs', 'Forrest', 'deals', 'mental', 'challenges', 'Jenny', 'survivor', 'child', 'abuse', 'Forrest', 'mom', 'poor', 'single', 'mom', 'Together', 'make', 'challenges.Well', 'recommended']",N/A
126433,A2AKFJOWF71WGV,0792140923,liveon14887,"[5, 6]","Forrest Gump. I could name a million reasons why this movie is considered one of the best. Could it be because of the storyline? The fact that is was wonderfully written? Or could it be because Robert Zemeckis managed to get the crowd really thinking, ""is that President J.F.K?"". Whatever reason it is, it has definately got me hooked on this movie for life.Directed by Robert Zemeckis (who also directed the movie ""Contact""), it is set in Alabama where it focuses on a very special boy, a boy who has many changes to come. His name is Forrest Gump (played by Michael Conner Humphreys). At first, Forrest had to wear leg braces to straighten out his back. But what the eyes of the other kids saw in Forrest was just a ""retard"" except for one, who could see right through Forrest Gump and see just another kid trying to live. This one went by the name of Jenny Curran (Hanna R. Hall), who would soon become Forrest ""very best friend"". The movie starts from scratch, where Forrest is a kid right until the time he is a grown man. Forrest soon goes to College, graduates, enters the Army, where he meets his two other best friends (Ben Bufford 'Bubba' Blue, played by Mykelti Williamson, and Lt. Dan Taylor, played by Gary Sinise), owns a shrimp company, becomes a table-tennis professional, becomes a war hero and soon marries Jenny. All this happened because Forrest believed he could make it happen.To me, Forrest Gump is the story about survival and belief. To believe in yourself, believing you can achieve anything you want to achieve if you try. To achieve goals, you must set them out but Forrest never set his goals out, he just made them happen which is another reason why this is one of the best films ever made.Forrest Gump managed to earn an Oscar for Best Actor (Tom Hanks), Best Director (Robert Zemickis), Best Picture, Best Visual Effects, Best Editing and Best Writing. Gary Sinise, who played Lt. Dan, managed to earn a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. What I found amazing about this endless film is the way Zemickis brought back alive the past. If you have seen the movie, you will definately remember the live footages of President John F. Kennedy, John Lennon of the Beatles, President M. Nixon and the late Alabama Gov. George Wallace. It was really interesting and impressing how Zemickis made it look like Tom Hanks was really there with them all.Memorable scenes? Of course there is. You'll definately always remember two very catchy pick-up lines in this film- ""Run, Forrest, Run"" (as said by Jenny) and ""Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get"". The scene where Forrest's leg braces break off while running away from the bikers, where young Forrest unexpectedly says ""HUH HUH HUH HUH"" to the principal of the school, where older Forrest surprisingly ejaculates when his hand is placed on Jenny's breast, where Forrest rescues at least 6 soldiers from the battlefields, where Forrest introduces himself to Bubba saying ""My name is Forrest Gump. People call me Forrest Gump"" (LMAO), where Forrest jumps off his boat surprised to see Lt. Dan again, where Forrest plays football, where Forrest runs miles and miles, where Forrest asks Jenny to marry him, there's an endless list of memorable scenes.Forrest Gump. Who else knows a movie that EVERYONE can enjoy? A movie with much power, enough power to bring tears to your eyes? A movie that is unforgettable? A movie that has that MANY memorable scenes? I, for one, sure can't think of any, which is why I rate this a definite 5 star movie.

Not really, as a strong implication of the movie is that you have to work hard at your life, no matter what you find in your box of chocolates.It is just a ""feel good"" movie as many have written? I don't think so, it goes deeper than that. And in fact it did not make me feel good at all. In the end I could not help but feeling angry at Jenny for what she did to Gump. Of course, most of us men have had our ""Jenny"" in our lives.

I can't stop watching it. I love the twists and turns, and I also like how Forrest's deeper feelings are shown. Friends, enemies, and lovers are combined into this film. In this movie, Forrest Gump, a seemingly stupid man who does whatever people tell him to, is telling the story of his life, starting when he is six. His story goes through high school and college, and then goes to the army. Through his story he meets Jennie and Bubba, the love of his life and his best friend. He meets enemies, and is devastated by loss after loss. I really enjoyed this movie. I laughed a lot, but afterwards I had to sit and think about what Forrest had gone through. This is one of the greatest movies of all time in my opinion.  Forrest's deeper feelings will really make you think hard about people who are different or dumb. Quotes like ""Stupid is as stupid does"" and ""mama always told me life was like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get"" make you laugh at first, but then make you ponder about what Forrest is thinking and how true his thoughts are.

Director Robert Zemeckics forces the audience to view world events through the supposed inadequate viewpoint of Forest Gump, played by Tom Hanks in the role of a lifetime. Gump is first introduced in the quietest of ways, a mentally challenged man sitting on a park bench, talking to whoever happens to sit by him. His memories of a life twisted by the evils of the outside world but strengthened by his own iron core of solid values form the basis of the film.  His low key introduction that has since become immortalized in our lexicon--My name is Forrest Gump. My friends call me Forrest Gump--first implies that Gump is a mentally deficient nobody with nothing of value to say.  But as he leads his first listener into his life history, both that listener and then we in the audience quickly realize that Gump's deficiencies are limited to high scores on the SAT.  In all the matters that count, Gump sees with a blinding clarity that seems to be lacking intellectual content mostly because of his hesitant drawling speech rhythms. Gump suffers plenty at the hands of an uncaring society, collectively symbolized by the mean children on the school bus who deny him a place to sit.  Yet even there, Gump learns that there are those who can see his essential goodness: Jenny, whom he learns to love; Bubba, the shrimp king whom Gump dedicates his future shrimp business, and Lt. Dan, a man who lost legs in combat reduce his physical mobility in a manner that parallels Gump's social immobility.FORREST GUMP allows Hanks to portray a critical period of American history in a series of vignettes that brings to mind Chaucer's CANTERBURY TALES, with each tale of both epics ranging from comedy, to pathos, to stark tragedy.  Jenny, Bubba, and Lt. Dan are essentially good people who have blind spots that prevent them from seeing the world as clearly as does Forrest. One of the central ironies of the film is that director Zemeckis wants the audience to believe--at least at first--that it is Forrest Gump who lacks the capacity for clear thought.  The astonishment that I felt at the end was to wonder why it took so long for Jenny, Bubba, and Lt. Dan to even approach the clarity of thought that Forrest so effortlessly achieved.  FORREST GUMP is one of the best pictures of all time and repeated viewings merely confirms that.",5,Watching World Events Through the Eye of a Storm,1125705600,"09 3, 2005",2005,2510,"['FORREST', 'GUMP', 'one', 'magical', 'movies', 'not', 'only', 'attention', 'run', '142', 'minutes', 'also', 'ponder', 'long', 'closing', 'credits', 'Director', 'Robert', 'Zemeckics', 'audience', 'view', 'world', 'events', 'supposed', 'inadequate', 'viewpoint', 'Forest', 'Gump', 'played', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'role', 'lifetime', 'Gump', 'first', 'introduced', 'quietest', 'ways', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'man', 'sitting', 'park', 'bench', 'talking', 'whoever', 'happens', 'sit', 'memories', 'life', 'twisted', 'evils', 'outside', 'world', 'strengthened', 'own', 'iron', 'core', 'solid', 'values', 'form', 'basis', 'film', 'low', 'key', 'introduction', 'become', 'immortalized', 'lexicon', 'name', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'friends', 'call', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'first', 'implies', 'Gump', 'mentally', 'deficient', 'nobody', 'nothing', 'value', 'say', 'first', 'listener', 'life', 'history', 'listener', 'then', 'audience', 'quickly', 'realize', 'Gump', 'deficiencies', 'are', 'limited', 'high', 'scores', 'SAT', 'matters', 'count', 'Gump', 'blinding', 'clarity', 'be', 'lacking', 'intellectual', 'content', 'mostly', 'hesitant', 'drawling', 'speech', 'rhythms', 'Gump', 'suffers', 'plenty', 'hands', 'uncaring', 'society', 'collectively', 'symbolized', 'mean', 'children', 'school', 'bus', 'who', 'deny', 'place', 'sit', 'even', 'Gump', 'are', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'essential', 'goodness', 'Jenny', 'whom', 'love', 'Bubba', 'shrimp', 'king', 'whom', 'Gump', 'future', 'shrimp', 'business', 'Lt.', 'Dan', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'legs', 'combat', 'reduce', 'physical', 'mobility', 'manner', 'Gump', 'social', 'immobility.FORREST', 'GUMP', 'Hanks', 'portray', 'critical', 'period', 'American', 'history', 'series', 'vignettes', 'mind', 'Chaucer', 'CANTERBURY', 'TALES', 'tale', 'epics', 'ranging', 'comedy', 'pathos', 'stark', 'tragedy', 'Jenny', 'Bubba', 'Lt.', 'Dan', 'are', 'essentially', 'good', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'blind', 'spots', 'prevent', 'seeing', 'world', 'as', 'clearly', 'Forrest', 'One', 'central', 'ironies', 'film', 'director', 'Zemeckis', 'audience', 'believe', 'least', 'first', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'who', 'capacity', 'clear', 'thought', 'astonishment', 'felt', 'end', 'was', 'wonder', 'why', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'Jenny', 'Bubba', 'Lt.', 'Dan', 'even', 'approach', 'clarity', 'thought', 'Forrest', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'achieved', 'FORREST', 'GUMP', 'one', 'best', 'pictures', 'time', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'merely']",N/A

He goes to Vietnam and meets Lt.Dan(Sinise). He also meets Bubba(Williamson) who he later names his shirmping company after. He becomes a war hero and a millionaire through hard work. He is missing one thing though and thats Jenny.Jenny takes a much differnt path after high school. She gets into drugs and goes through the hippie movement. She does disco and does more drugs. She realizes her life is the pit, but theres one thing thats always been constant in her life and that Forrest.This movie is a fantastic tale of two people who take different roads but can't get away from each other. The love has always been there, but commitment wasn't. Will the two end up together, you'll just have to watch the movie because I wont spoil everything.Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump is captivating. It's one of the greatest performances by an actor ever. He won the Oscar that year for Best Actor and it would have been a sham if he haven't. His peformance as the mentally challenged man in all the big events will bring you to tears. You leave the movie wishing you could be full of life and innocent like Forrest Gump. Tom Hanks is the man and In my opinion this is top 5 performances ever. You can't help but love him. No one else could have been Forrest. Nobody.Robin Wright gives the performance of her carear in this movie. She's awesome as Jenny. She displays the emotions of the character so well. We can all relate to her character in a way.The two characters cover almost all the major of events from the 60's on to the early 80's. They stir up memories and everything looks authentic. It's magical and funny as you think back about these two love birds and the situations they are in.Gary Sinise gives the performance of his carear as well. He was nominated for Best Supporting Actor but lost. He should have won it over Marin Landua. Lt. Dan brings more emotion to the movie as he relates to Forrest in different ways. There friendship is special and the two change each others lives.Robert Zemcki's established himself as a Hollywood elite with Forrest Gump. He already had hits like Back to the Future and Who Frammed Roger Rabbit under his belt. Forrest Gump is the icing on the cake though. It's a special movie and the way he made it is beautiful. He deserved his Oscar for Best Director.The movie is so well made. It won Oscars for Editing and Effects and you will see why. It was nominated for 13 Oscars and it won six. It could have easily won any of the others as well.The DVD extras are great. There is a second disk jammed with stuff. The stuff on the making of the movie is great. The documentaries are great as well. If you love DVD extras, then pick it up. It's worth it.This is one of the greatest movies ever made. It's a passionate love story and an awesome tail of a man, just being himself. Everybody should see this movie at one point or another in life. I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone who isn't a teenager. It deserves it's PG-13 rating and some people argue an R rating, but I think thats stretching it. Buy this movie and experience the phenomenom that is Forrest Gump.",5,One of the greatest stories and performance ever,1091404800,"08 2, 2004",2004,3672,"['hard', 'believe', 'Forrest', 'Gump', '10', 'years', 'old', 'year', 'amazing', 'tale', 'mentaly', 'challenged', 'man', 'passionate', 'love', 'story.Forrest', 'Gump', 'Hanks', 'small', 'town', 'Alabama', 'father', 'mother', 'Fields', 'Forrest', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'mother', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'hold', 'down', 'only', 'one', 'friend', 'mother', 'name', 'Jenny', 'Wright', 'two', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'get', 'older', 'lives', 'take', 'different', 'paths.Forrest', 'huge', 'success', 'up', 'attending', 'Alabama', 'where', 'All-American', 'football', 'Vietnam', 'meets', 'Lt.Dan', 'Sinise', 'also', 'Bubba', 'Williamson', 'who', 'later', 'shirmping', 'company', 'war', 'hero', 'millionaire', 'hard', 'work', 'missing', 'one', 'thing', 'thats', 'Jenny.Jenny', 'much', 'differnt', 'path', 'high', 'school', 'drugs', 'hippie', 'movement', 'disco', 'more', 'drugs', 'life', 'pit', 'one', 'thing', 'thats', 'always', 'been', 'constant', 'life', 'Forrest.This', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'tale', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'take', 'different', 'roads', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'away', 'other', 'love', 'always', 'been', 'there', 'commitment', 'was', ""n't"", 'Will', 'two', 'end', 'up', 'together', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'wont', 'spoil', 'everything.Tom', 'Hanks', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'captivating', 'one', 'greatest', 'performances', 'actor', 'ever', 'won', 'Oscar', 'year', 'Best', 'Actor', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'sham', 'have', ""n't"", 'peformance', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'man', 'big', 'events', 'will', 'bring', 'tears', 'leave', 'movie', 'wishing', 'could', 'be', 'full', 'life', 'innocent', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'man', 'opinion', 'top', '5', 'performances', 'ever', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'one', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Forrest', 'Nobody.Robin', 'Wright', 'performance', 'carear', 'movie', 'awesome', 'Jenny', 'emotions', 'character', 'so', 'well', 'can', 'relate', 'character', 'way.The', 'two', 'characters', 'cover', 'almost', 'major', 'events', '60', 'early', '80', 'stir', 'up', 'memories', 'everything', 'looks', 'authentic', 'magical', 'funny', 'think', 'back', 'two', 'love', 'birds', 'situations', 'are', 'in.Gary', 'Sinise', 'performance', 'carear', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'lost', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'over', 'Marin', 'Landua', 'Lt.', 'Dan', 'more', 'emotion', 'movie', 'Forrest', 'different', 'ways', 'friendship', 'special', 'two', 'change', 'others', 'lives.Robert', 'Zemcki', 'established', 'Hollywood', 'elite', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'already', 'had', 'hits', 'Back', 'Future', 'Who', 'Frammed', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'belt', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'icing', 'cake', 'special', 'movie', 'way', 'made', 'beautiful', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Director.The', 'movie', 'so', 'well', 'made', 'won', 'Oscars', 'Editing', 'Effects', 'will', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'nominated', '13', 'Oscars', 'won', 'six', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'won', 'others', 'well.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'great', 'second', 'disk', 'jammed', 'stuff', 'stuff', 'making', 'movie', 'great', 'documentaries', 'are', 'great', 'well', 'love', 'DVD', 'extras', 'then', 'pick', 'up', 'worth', 'it.This', 'one', 'greatest', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'passionate', 'love', 'story', 'awesome', 'tail', 'man', 'just', 'being', 'Everybody', 'should', 'see', 'movie', 'one', 'point', 'life', 'would', ""n't"", 'reccomend', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'teenager', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'people', 'argue', 'R', 'rating', 'think', 'thats', 'stretching', 'Buy', 'movie', 'experience', 'phenomenom', 'Forrest', 'Gump']",N/A

126466,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,0792140923,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[4, 5]","I'm going to disagree with a couple of other reviewers on here, and say this is a great movie. Why do people have to over-analyse things? And another thing: does Forrest really get the girl in the end? Cos if you watch right to the end, technically, he doesn't. In a way.My mum is a big fan of Tom Hanks, and watches Green Mile over & over, but whenever I suggest another Tom Hanks movie to her, she doesn't fancy it. I managed to sit her down in front of this, and she really enjoyed it! I love this movie, despite the length, and it has a great many stars in it: Robin Wright Penn, Sally Field, and Gary Sinise, to name but a few.I especially love how when Lieutenant Dan loses the bottom half of his legs, how it's done. It's fantastic! At first I thought, particularly when he was in the bed/wheelchair, that they were underneath him, or put through a hole in the bed, but apparently, his lower legs were wrapped in a special blue fabric that allowed them to be optically removed from the film by computer later.Lieutenant Dan tells Forrest that the day Forrest works on a shrimp boat is the day he'd be an astronaut. This is a reference to the book, where Forrest actually becomes an astronaut, and the following year, they appeared together as astronauts in Apollo 13.The Doors have more songs in the movie than any other band with a total of five. These are, ""Soul Kitchen"" (in one of the Vietnam scenes), ""Hello, I Love You"" (first song in Forrest's first ping pong sequence), ""Break On Through"" (second song in Forrest's first ping pong sequence), ""People Are Strange"" (third song in Forrest's first ping pong sequence), and ""Love Her Madly"" (when Jenny is leaving the hotel room with a black eye after presumably resorting to prostitution).I love Jenny's character in this, played by Robin Wright Penn. It's the way her whole look changes constantly throughout the movie, while Forrest stays the exact same. I think the character of Kayleigh from Butterfly Effect was loosely based around Jenny's character, as both characters change so much throughout the movie.There's a lot of historical events in this movie, including meeting Elvis and teaching him how to dance, he met John Lennon and gave him his inspiration for Imagine (and two presidents), he was in Vietnam and started the Watergate scandal ... he even got rich and famous. I think the Watergate scandal went straight over my head, didn't understand that bit at all. Everyone knows this stuff wasn't likely to ever happen, and I hate the fact that they used old news reels, and someone attempted (albeit badly) to change the words the people were actually speaking! The lip movements are very wrong.It's hard to believe this movie is now 10 years old, and fingers crossed, in another ten years, it'll be considered even more of a classic than it is now. If you liked the Back To The Future trilogy, and any other Robert Zemeckis movie, then you'll love this.

126474,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,0792140923,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[54, 67]","When I first saw the film &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; in a theater in 1994, I knew that director Robert Zemeckis had created a heart-warming masterpiece that would more than likely earn it Oscar recognition, and it certainly did.  The endearing film follows the life of an educationally challenged man named Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) from the time of his childhood (played by Michael Conner Humphreys) until early middle age.  His mother (Sally Field) made sure that he would be treated just like everyone else so that he could take care of himself once she was gone.  In addition to his learning disability, Forrest was required to wear leg braces as a child that made him the target of ridicule from other children, except for one girl named Jenny Curran (Hanna R. Hall).  However, Forrest quickly discovered that his legs weren't that bad when he found an innate ability to run.  When Forrest decided to join the U.S. Army, he meets his two best friends: a fellow recruit named Pvt. Benjamin Buford 'Bubba' Blue (Mykelti Williamson) and Lt. Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise).  Bubba loved to talk about shrimp and Lt. Dan was raised to be a soldier.  Forrest's relationship with Jenny, as well as his relationships with Bubba and Lt. Dan, led Forrest down several unexpected paths that allowed him to meet several pivotal historical figures.Tom Hanks' superb performance as the loveable Forrest Gump earned him his well-deserved second Oscar for Best Actor.  (He had previously won the Oscar for Best Actor for the 1993 film &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, and has been nominated three other times.)  Robert Zemeckis also earned the Oscar for Best Director, and the film itself won the Oscar for Best Picture as well as three other Oscars for Best Visual Effects, Best Editing and Best Writing.  Gary Sinise earned an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, in addition to six other Oscar nominations that included Best Cinematography, Best Music and Best Sound.  Part of what &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; so endearing was Zemeckis' use of superimposing actors into actual, historical film footage.  This footage included the late Pres. John F. Kennedy, the late John Lennon, the late Pres. Richard M. Nixon, and the late former Alabama Gov. George Wallace to name a few.  (Robert Zemeckis used this same archival footage technique again in the 1997 film &quot;Contact&quot;.)  Other memorable characters in the film include school bus driver Dorothy Harris (Siobhan Fallon), Bubba's mother (Marlena Smalls), Abbie Hoffman (Richard D'Alessandro) and Forrest Gump Jr. (Haley Joel Osment).Some of the many memorable scenes in the film include the opening scenes, running with leg braces, running across the football field during practice, scenes at the University of Alabama, boot camp, Vietnam, D.C., NYC, the shrimping boat, running across America, and the scenes with Jenny (both as child and adult).  I regard &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; as one of the best films ever made and rate it with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  It's the kind of film that draws the viewer into its story and keeps the viewer engaged throughout its 142 minutes.

Tom Hanks went on to star in many more memorable film roles, including his roles in &quot;Apollo 13&quot; (1995), &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (1998), &quot;The Green Mile&quot; (1999) and &quot;Cast Away&quot; (2000) to name a few.

He has no agenda, no plans, just a love of life and all that is in it.  He is the modern symbol of innocence, and that is why he became such a symbol after the movie release.The director traces time from the 50's I'd say all the way to the 70's, with tons of music along the journey.  The film was highly effective, although was often seen more as a comic endeavor.  Too many young people overlooked the overriding tale of innocence in a crazy and sin-filled world.Forrest, played by Tom Hanks, is contrasted against his life-long love Jenny, played by Robin Wright Penn.  Jenny experiences all of the mood swings of American culture, i.e., hippie culture, drug life, and so on.  However, Forrest, although he is much more face to face with the most gripping of realities, such as Vietnam and presidential assassinations, never strays from his half-minded yet picture perfect view of reality.I really liked the attempt that this movie made with the story of everlasting innocence and love; however, too many were distracted by Forrest's many guffaws, specifically his speech impediment.  In addition, many believe this to have a great soundtrack, but combining a vast variety of songs that were popular is not original, instead a score could have been extensively used throughout the entire film instead of using clippings of 60's/70's popular hits no matter how much we liked them.Also, we probably got the message way before the film was over and thus could have skipped parts of the film and been just the same.  Lastly, I did not like the hype, and was sick of all the people quoting the film.  Now, I only saw this film a few days ago, and for many that is shocking; however, this film was not as powerful as people pre-suppose.Yes, this film was good.

It is a magnificent movie with an all-star cast and a wonderful sceenplay based on the novel by Winston Groom.  Winston Groom truly created a phenomenon when he created the character Forrest Gump, a mentally retarded man, who tries to live a normal life.  As Forrest tells his life story to several people at his bus stop, he shows us that he's not at all different than any other person and that he has accomplished more than others despite his problem.  Thrown in his story is his childhood friend Jenny(Robin Wright Penn) who becomes a drug-addicted prostitute , Lt.

And it was spectacular.  Tom Hanks is perfect as Forrest Gump.  Won 6 Oscars for Best Actor (Tom Hanks), Best Director (Robert Zemekis), Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Picture, and Best Screenplay.  Went to this touching story about a simple man named Forrest Gump who, even though isn't very bright, accidently ends up getting involved with some of the biggest key moments of the 19th century.  It's funny, touching, heart warming, and sad.  I read the book, and the first line even touched me.  I highly recommend watching this.  It deserves a chance.  I've seen it 14 times in counting too!

126492,A2Z9FXHC1L66EW,0792140923,"Mr. ""alan5973""","[1, 3]","You never know what you're gonna get!Forrest Gump is without a doubt one of the best films of the 1990s.  Very unique, very original, very wonderful!  And now with the release of this gem onto DVD, you get even more to write home to Momma about.2 Audio Commentaries - The first with Director Robert Zemeckis, Producer Steve Starkey and Production Designer Rick Carter is a nice mix of storytelling, special effects talk, and personal memories, while the second commentary by Producer Wendy Finerman is a more intimate setting (since she's alone), giving cute stories such as the reason why the speakers are cut off while Forrest is speaking in Washington D.C. is because no one could think of anything profound enough for him to say for real.Through The Eyes of Forrest Gump - This 30 minute documentary is one of the most famous, in that it was sold separately on video in stores all over the country...and sold well.  On the laserdisc of Forrest Gump it was included as a bonus on side 4.  So many wonderful moments from the film are discussed, including how they were able to have Tom Hanks shake hands and interact with JFK, turning Tom into a ping pong wizard, as well as making Gary Sinise (Lt. Dan) believably look as if he truly lost his legs.  This is certainly not your run of the mill &quot;making of&quot; that gets boring after a few minutes.  It instead holds your interest to the point where you're saying &quot;WOW!!  So that's how they did it!&quot;  My only complaint is that the transfer of this documentary didn't seem crisp and sharp enough.  It almost seemed like they just copied it off of a laserdisc.  I happen to own the laserdisc, so I compared the two and to me, the laser looked brighter and sharper.  But it's a minor complaint.  The film itself looks great!The Magic of Makeup - A wonderful look at how the makeup in this film was so crucial to its success.  Included is makeup for Tom Hanks, Robin Wright Penn, Gary Sinise and Sally Field.  Tom's beard growing is interesting, but watching Sally Field being transformed into an elderly woman is astonishing!Through The Ears of Forrest Gump - This is the sort of thing most moviegoers take for granted...the sound of a film.  When you watch this segment you'll get a sense of just how important sound was in making scenes come alive: the sound of the bikes rolling after a young Forrest as he breaks free of his metal braces, the tracers and mortar explosions during the Vietnam sequence, creating different ways to convey the sound of the rain in Vietnam as Forrest had said rained in so many different ways, the storm at sea, and much more!Building The World of Gump - Creating the places and settings of the film, including Forrest's home in Alabama, Vietnam, and Washington D.C.  All crucial to the films believability.Seeing Is Believing - 11 visual effects from the film are discussed, including 2 that didn't make the final cut.  Forrest was planned to meet Martin Luther King, Jr., a scene involving dogs being released to stop what Forrest thought was a &quot;parade&quot; of black Americans, headed by King.  But because Forrest knew all the dogs since they were puppies, he unknowingly stops the violence by getting their attention with a stick, then apologizes to Mr. King, himself (&quot;They're just dogs&quot;) - The other new scene is a ping pong match with George Bush Sr when he was the Ambassador to China and having Forrest hit him in the crotch with the ball.  Both of these scenes are winners to me, but I'm sure they may have bogged down the story some, and that's why they were cut.  Nice to have them here though.Photo Gallery - Some nice still shots of the film that are definitely worth looking at.Screen Tests - A total of 7, the first 3 with Michael Conner Humphrey (Young Forrest) and Hanna R. Hall (Young Jenny), 2 with Robin Wright Penn (Jenny), and 2 with Haley Joel Osment (Forrest Gump Jr.).  Besides witnessing these characters coming to life for the first time through the actors, it's also interesting to see Tom Hanks before he employed Micheal Humphrey's accent to his own and how this made a huge difference.2 Theatrical Trailers - including the &quot;Remember...&quot; trailer, which contains no dialogue and just uses Alan Silvestri's wonderful score.Get the film that gave Tom Hanks his second consecutive Oscar on DVD in a nice two disc set.  Relive the magic and the memories.  Relive Forrest Gump.&quot;And that's all I have to say about that&quot;. - Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump",5,My Mamma always said that life is like a box of DVD extras..,999388800,"09 2, 2001",2001,4505,"['never', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'gon', 'get', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'doubt', 'one', 'best', 'films', '1990s', 'Very', 'unique', 'very', 'original', 'very', 'wonderful', 'now', 'release', 'gem', 'DVD', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'write', 'home', 'Momma', 'about.2', 'Audio', 'Commentaries', 'first', 'Director', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'Producer', 'Steve', 'Starkey', 'Production', 'Designer', 'Rick', 'Carter', 'nice', 'mix', 'storytelling', 'special', 'effects', 'talk', 'personal', 'memories', 'second', 'commentary', 'Producer', 'Wendy', 'Finerman', 'more', 'intimate', 'setting', 'alone', 'giving', 'cute', 'stories', 'such', 'reason', 'why', 'speakers', 'are', 'cut', 'off', 'Forrest', 'speaking', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'one', 'could', 'think', 'anything', 'profound', 'enough', 'say', 'real.Through', 'Eyes', 'Forrest', 'Gump', '30', 'minute', 'documentary', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'was', 'sold', 'separately', 'video', 'stores', 'country', 'sold', 'well', 'laserdisc', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'was', 'included', 'bonus', 'side', '4', 'So', 'many', 'wonderful', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'discussed', 'including', 'how', 'were', 'able', 'have', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'shake', 'hands', 'interact', 'JFK', 'turning', 'Tom', 'ping', 'pong', 'wizard', 'as', 'well', 'making', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'Lt.', 'Dan', 'believably', 'look', 'lost', 'legs', 'certainly', 'not', 'run', 'mill', 'quot', 'making', 'quot', 'boring', 'few', 'minutes', 'instead', 'interest', 'point', 'where', ""'re"", 'saying', 'quot', 'WOW', 'how', 'did', 'quot', 'My', 'only', 'complaint', 'transfer', 'documentary', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'crisp', 'sharp', 'enough', 'almost', 'seemed', 'just', 'copied', 'laserdisc', 'happen', 'own', 'laserdisc', 'compared', 'two', 'laser', 'looked', 'brighter', 'sharper', 'minor', 'complaint', 'film', 'great', 'Magic', 'Makeup', 'wonderful', 'look', 'how', 'makeup', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'crucial', 'success', 'Included', 'makeup', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'Sally', 'Field', 'Tom', 'beard', 'growing', 'interesting', 'watching', 'Sally', 'Field', 'being', 'transformed', 'elderly', 'woman', 'astonishing', 'Ears', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'sort', 'thing', 'most', 'moviegoers', 'take', 'granted', 'sound', 'film', 'When', 'watch', 'segment', ""'ll"", 'get', 'sense', 'just', 'how', 'important', 'sound', 'was', 'making', 'scenes', 'come', 'alive', 'sound', 'bikes', 'rolling', 'young', 'Forrest', 'free', 'metal', 'braces', 'tracers', 'mortar', 'explosions', 'Vietnam', 'sequence', 'creating', 'different', 'ways', 'convey', 'sound', 'rain', 'Vietnam', 'Forrest', 'had', 'said', 'rained', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'ways', 'storm', 'sea', 'much', 'more', 'Building', 'World', 'Gump', 'Creating', 'places', 'settings', 'film', 'including', 'Forrest', 'home', 'Alabama', 'Vietnam', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'All', 'crucial', 'films', 'believability.Seeing', 'Believing', '11', 'visual', 'effects', 'film', 'are', 'discussed', 'including', '2', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'final', 'cut', 'Forrest', 'was', 'planned', 'meet', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Jr.', 'scene', 'involving', 'dogs', 'being', 'released', 'stop', 'what', 'Forrest', 'thought', 'was', 'quot', 'quot', 'black', 'Americans', 'headed', 'King', 'Forrest', 'knew', 'dogs', 'were', 'puppies', 'unknowingly', 'violence', 'getting', 'attention', 'stick', 'then', 'Mr.', 'King', 'quot', ""'re"", 'just', 'dogs', 'quot', 'other', 'new', 'scene', 'ping', 'pong', 'match', 'George', 'Bush', 'Sr', 'when', 'was', 'Ambassador', 'China', 'having', 'Forrest', 'hit', 'crotch', 'ball', 'scenes', 'are', 'winners', ""'m"", 'sure', 'may', 'have', 'bogged', 'down', 'story', 'why', 'were', 'cut', 'Nice', 'have', 'here', 'Gallery', 'nice', 'still', 'shots', 'film', 'are', 'definitely', 'worth', 'looking', 'at.Screen', 'Tests', 'total', '7', 'first', '3', 'Michael', 'Conner', 'Humphrey', 'Young', 'Forrest', 'Hanna', 'R.', 'Hall', 'Young', 'Jenny', '2', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'Jenny', '2', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'Jr.', 'witnessing', 'characters', 'coming', 'life', 'first', 'time', 'actors', 'also', 'interesting', 'see', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'employed', 'Micheal', 'Humphrey', 'accent', 'own', 'how', 'made', 'huge', 'difference.2', 'Theatrical', 'Trailers', 'including', 'quot', 'Remember', 'quot', 'trailer', 'dialogue', 'just', 'uses', 'Alan', 'Silvestri', 'wonderful', 'score.Get', 'film', 'gave', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'second', 'consecutive', 'Oscar', 'DVD', 'nice', 'two', 'disc', 'set', 'Relive', 'magic', 'memories', 'Relive', 'Forrest', 'Gump.', 'quot', 'have', 'say', 'quot', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Forrest', 'Gump']",N/A

126502,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,0792140923,Nix Pix,"[1, 6]","""Forrest Gump"" is the sweeping story of a simpleton (Tom Hanks) whose view of the world is both clairvoyant and poignant.  After being told that he will never walk without the aid of leg braces, young Forrest breaks free of his irons, goes on to become a college football star, a decorated war hero, the CEO of a lucrative shrimp business, and finally, a husband to the ill-fated girl of his dreams (Robin Wright Penn) and a father (Haley Joel Osmond in an early role). What makes the film so remarkable is its handling of the central character. Like Dustin Hoffman's Raymond, Tom Hanks brilliant performance as Forrest is thoughtful, introspective and fine wrought with compassion. Director, Robert Zemeckis never allows sympathy or stereotyping of the mentally handicap to override the poignancy or expanse of his narrative. Gary Sinise is magnificent as Lt. Dan Taylor - a hot shot military man until war robs him of the use of both of his legs. Sally Fields excels as Forrest's mother, a woman determined to see that her son lives a full and useful life.The transfer from Paramount Home Video is somewhat disappointing. Sourced from a print rather than the original camera negative, colors are generally weak though sometimes nicely balanced. There's some age related dirt and scratches present throughout the print that, for a film of this vintage should NOT be an issue. The anamorphic framing is consistent but fine details are lost in many of the darker scenes. There's a considerable amount of film and digital grain present for a picture that, at times, is smooth, but at other times is rather harsh on the eyes. The audio is 5.1 and nicely balanced with a real kick in the musical score and special effects.  The extras include a documentary on the making of the film, some interviews with the cast members and director, the film's theatrical trailer and some television spots.  Overall, this is a less of a stellar visual presentation than it should have been.",3,GUMP IS AS GUMP DOES - THE EXTRAORDINARY FELLOW!,1086739200,"06 9, 2004",2004,1972,"['Forrest', 'Gump', 'sweeping', 'story', 'simpleton', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'view', 'world', 'clairvoyant', 'poignant', 'being', 'told', 'will', 'never', 'walk', 'aid', 'leg', 'braces', 'young', 'Forrest', 'breaks', 'free', 'irons', 'become', 'college', 'football', 'star', 'decorated', 'war', 'hero', 'CEO', 'lucrative', 'shrimp', 'business', 'finally', 'husband', 'ill-fated', 'girl', 'dreams', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'father', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osmond', 'early', 'role', 'What', 'film', 'so', 'remarkable', 'handling', 'central', 'character', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Raymond', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Forrest', 'thoughtful', 'introspective', 'fine', 'wrought', 'compassion', 'Director', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'never', 'sympathy', 'stereotyping', 'mentally', 'handicap', 'override', 'poignancy', 'expanse', 'narrative', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'magnificent', 'Lt.', 'Dan', 'Taylor', 'hot', 'shot', 'military', 'man', 'war', 'robs', 'use', 'legs', 'Sally', 'Fields', 'excels', 'Forrest', 'mother', 'woman', 'determined', 'see', 'son', 'full', 'useful', 'life.The', 'transfer', 'Paramount', 'Home', 'Video', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'Sourced', 'print', 'rather', 'original', 'camera', 'negative', 'colors', 'are', 'generally', 'weak', 'sometimes', 'nicely', 'balanced', 'age', 'related', 'dirt', 'scratches', 'present', 'print', 'film', 'vintage', 'should', 'NOT', 'be', 'issue', 'anamorphic', 'framing', 'consistent', 'fine', 'details', 'are', 'lost', 'many', 'darker', 'scenes', 'considerable', 'amount', 'film', 'digital', 'grain', 'present', 'picture', 'times', 'smooth', 'other', 'times', 'rather', 'harsh', 'eyes', 'audio', '5.1', 'nicely', 'balanced', 'real', 'kick', 'musical', 'score', 'special', 'effects', 'extras', 'include', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'interviews', 'cast', 'members', 'director', 'film', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'television', 'spots', 'Overall', 'less', 'stellar', 'visual', 'presentation', 'should', 'have', 'been']",N/A

To start with, Tom Hanks and Gary Sinise are two of my favorite actors. On top of that, I have been taken with Robin Wright ever since her role as Princess Buttercup.I was a much different person when &quot;Forest Gump&quot; was first released. I held to a world view that looked down upon its blatant appeal to sentiment. For the obviously good acting job that Hanks did, I did not then feel that this film deserved to win best picture. Over time, my views have changed. While I still view &quot;Gump&quot; as a little too sentimental, I have to admit that it is one heck of a picture.Great performances abound in this movie. Hanks is the most obvious. He is indeed Forest Gump. I doubt any other actor could have pulled off this role so convincingly. Sinise is outstanding as Lieutenant Dan Taylor. He manages to be over the top without becoming absurd. Wright's Jenny is a moving counterpoint to Forest. Mykelti Williamson does a great job with what he is given.The world as seen through the eyes of Forest Gump is definitely not &quot;reality.&quot; That said, we get enough &quot;reality&quot; every day. Zemeckis &amp; company took what could have been shallow escapism and instead they fashioned it into a lens with which to view different parts of ourselves more clearly.I recommend &quot;Forest Gump&quot; very highly.

What the range of conclusions might be is hard to say: I mean, what is Gump trying so hard to tell us? As he strides  back and forth across America, becoming hairier by the minute, are we not  walking in the crowd behind him, trying to get a grip on what it's all  about? It seems to me that that is Gump's mission, to get us up and  thinking; certainly not following gurus from coast to coast. If Gump can  figure it out (and it seems that eventually, he had just about everything  figured out), then maybe we can too. Maybe we don't all have moms who  believe in us that much, but even so, maybe we could all try just that much  harder: like Gump.It's a fascinating look at America, with its odd  historical background and the tendency for the underdog to somehow win  through. Still, we must not forget that Gump is a white American and a  member of the most privileged race on Earth when it comes to getting hold  of the world's resources and running with them. That's what Gump did, but  maybe he was just silly enough not to be able to see the big picture like  everyone else, so that instead, he could take off on a voyage of personal  discovery. Maybe we could do something that simple ourselves....",5,Thinking hard about the world,957916800,"05 10, 2000",2000,1308,"['guess', 'lot', 'people', 'have', 'thought', 'hard', 'film', 'first', 'appeared', 'nearly', 'decade', 'ago', 'What', 'range', 'conclusions', 'might', 'be', 'hard', 'say', 'mean', 'what', 'Gump', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'tell', 'back', 'forth', 'America', 'becoming', 'hairier', 'minute', 'are', 'not', 'walking', 'crowd', 'trying', 'get', 'grip', 'what', 'Gump', 'mission', 'get', 'up', 'thinking', 'certainly', 'not', 'following', 'gurus', 'coast', 'coast', 'Gump', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'eventually', 'had', 'just', 'everything', 'figured', 'out', 'then', 'maybe', 'can', 'too', 'Maybe', 'do', ""n't"", 'all', 'have', 'moms', 'who', 'believe', 'much', 'even', 'so', 'maybe', 'could', 'try', 'just', 'that', 'much', 'harder', 'Gump.It', 'fascinating', 'look', 'America', 'odd', 'historical', 'background', 'tendency', 'underdog', 'somehow', 'win', 'Still', 'must', 'not', 'forget', 'Gump', 'white', 'American', 'member', 'most', 'privileged', 'race', 'Earth', 'when', 'getting', 'hold', 'world', 'resources', 'running', 'what', 'Gump', 'did', 'maybe', 'was', 'just', 'silly', 'enough', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'big', 'picture', 'everyone', 'else', 'instead', 'could', 'take', 'off', 'voyage', 'personal', 'discovery', 'Maybe', 'could', 'do', 'something', 'simple', 'ourselves']",N/A

Tom Hanks captures our hearts as Forest Gump, the loveable man of low IQ who convincingly just happens to find himself in some of the most historic moments of the last fifty years of our nation's history.  Robin Wright brilliantly plays his love interest Jenny, a character who, despite all her flaws and mistakes, is someone you'd like to be next to, like in the dorm room (wink wink.)  Sally Field and Gary Sinise both portray Forest's moral compass, doing an excellent job before, during, and after their times in his life overlap.  Mykelti Williamson comes in as Bubba, a friend and fellow soldier who serves as the inspiration that sets Forest up for the rest of his life (so he could mow that lawn for free.)  And let's not forget the ""special guest stars""...the presidents, talk show hosts, and other historical figures who Forest interacts with in his life.  CGI effects, ground-breaking for their time, make this possible so it really looks like Tom Hanks is shaking hands with President John F. Kennedy in 1994.

It was a box office smash ranking among the top five highest grossing movies of all time.  But it was also a critical darling, garnering across the board praise and a truckload of awards.  The movie became a cultural phenomenon, spawning cook books, quote books, a top ten soundtrack album and lines like &quot;stupid is as stupid does&quot; and &quot;life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get&quot; have permeated our dialect.  The movie has a nostalgic, feel good vibe thanks to the dimwitted Forrest's trek through 60's and 70's touchstone events.  Underneath all those warm feelings lies a darkness.  Bad things happen to just about everyone Forrest comes in contact with.  His best friend Bubba is killed in Vietnam, his other friend Lt. Dan loses both his legs, his mother dies of cancer and his beloved Jenny dies of AIDS.  Even the famous people Forrest comes across meet with disaster, President Kennedy &amp; John Lennon are assassinated, George Wallace is shot and Elvis Presley dies young.  There are superb performances all around.  Sally Field is feisty as Forrest's mama, Mykelti Williamson is funny as Bubba, Gary Sinese as Lt. Dan is a perfect rough edged foil to Forrest and Robin Wright as Jenny portrays the confusion that young people of the times felt perfectly.  While all those performances are of high quality, Forrest Gump is Tom Hanks' tour de force.  He is utterly brilliant as Forrest.  He is in virtually every scene of the movie and never once does he fail to astound.  He becomes Forrest and makes you care what happens to him.

It is the story of a simple man stumbling his way through life, but because of his ability to run, leads an extraordinary life.The greatest strength this movie has is how it tells the story spanning a lifetime in only two and a half hours. Nothing feels rushed; the audience just goes from one stage of Forest's life to his next on his quest to find happiness, and to be with his love, Jenny. We feel like we've lived his life along with him. Telling a story spanning almost 40 years effectively like this is not easy, and this movie should be a case study for anyone wishing to do so.The film doesn't try to deal in depth with many of the issues which come up, such as the protest of war, child abuse, woman battering, or AIDS. Some reviews I've read here have criticized it for not dealing with them. But it isn't trying to discuss them. Instead, it's showing how this simple, innocent man is lost in a sea of confusion, not understanding these issues, and so not thinking about them. The audience is shown the world through Forrest's eyes, and to Forrest, there are no issues in life beyond happiness, friendship, and Jenny.Forrest's life is a magical journey like that of Odysseus or Frodo Baggins, but set in our modern world. Yes, the audience has to suspend their belief of a simple guy making it so far in the cruel world. No, it isn't likely, but that's what makes it extraordinary. And it's never meant to mimic probability. That's what makes it a fantasy.

I've read quite a few of them, but none of them have had me change or even consider changing my opinion. Most were written by people with issues. Whether it be the presidential jokes, their lack of appreciation for the special effects or Tom Hank's &quot;poor&quot; portrayal of a mental challenged man. Yet, most of them complain about the film's lack of realism. How all of these events from the 70's to present day could ever possibly happen to one man.These people have yet to discover the magic of (and not to mention, the biggest reason for) movie making. Why does reality matter? The point of capturing the life of a man who lived through so many trivial events is because no one real person could possibly ever achieve it. And by sitting in your seat and joining him in his tears and laughter only lightens your heart, as this movie was meant to do. Those who can say that this movie almost made them vomit, have a lot of nerve and very little understanding for ""art"".The movie is about a man named Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) who is born to his mother (Sally Field) with a &quot;below normal&quot; IQ of 75. To add to his challenges in life, his crooked back burdens him to wear braces on his legs. While running away from bullies at the advice of his #1 girl Jenny (&quot;Run Forrest, run!&quot;), they break off revealing his ability to run like the wind.This ability lands him playing football, which lands him a scholarship to college, which leads him to the army where he learns to play ping pong and meets his best friend, Bubba, who teaches him all about shrimp. Place Forrest at a bus stop with a box of chocolates telling his whole story, and you have magic.This is one of my top 10 films by far. It is the true full body experience. It makes me cry and laugh.

The film spotlights some of the traumatic disasters and cultural phenomenon, the curious history of the 60's and 70""s, a watershed for boomer youth; God help us; it has marked us all.I guess if your top button is buttoned and your pants are hitched up, and if your hair is cut severely, then you have the Tom Hanks look for a Southern fellow that's mentally deficient, though he can run fast enough.  I agree with other reviewers, it's a Tom Hanks career highlight.  He is the good-hearted bumpkin that bumbles his way with honor.  The plot juxtapositions Hanks solid, folksy morals versus raw evil or angry ambiguity.  He knows there is his mother and there is a God.  That is powerful life-fulfilling fuel.In contrast, Forrest's childhood friend Jenny is lost.  Robin Wright plays the sexually abused cracker's daughter.  She's plenty smart and is perceptive enough to realize that Gump is a sweet friend, loyal.  However, she's on the run most of her life, drugs and 60's rock and roll and then LA and disco coke parties.  Naturally, after each of her prodigal returns to Forrest, she loves him physically, but she cannot love spiritually.  She does not find peace till she exorcises her lifestyle demons, seeking comfort in Forrest's arms; then there's the bittersweet finale.To booster my theory, Gary Sinese as Gump's Vietnam Lt, loses his legs in battle.  Gump wins the Medal of Honor by saving his platoon and Sinese too.  Lt. Dan is from a military family and is bitter that he has lost his legs rather than dying heroically.  Again and again, Sinese's post-Vietnam life is in turmoil as he is flabbergasted by Gump's successes.  The good Lt.is bitter in his cups.  Later in the shrimp boat storm scene, Sinese finds the Secular Hollywood God; literally he is baptized.  (Does Sinese really have legs or not.  Amazing special effect or they used an actor with stumps.  Ya got me?)Yes, there is a religious message:we are ruled by destiny and we float in the air like a feather simultaneously,an obvious Christian message that is never spoken as the PC crowd grapples with eternity.",5,"Very Sly, but PC God at Work",1134864000,"12 18, 2005",2005,2143,"['film', 'denunciation', 'generational', 'excess', 'film', 'spotlights', 'traumatic', 'disasters', 'cultural', 'phenomenon', 'curious', 'history', '60', '70', 's', 'watershed', 'boomer', 'youth', 'God', 'help', 'marked', 'all.I', 'guess', 'top', 'button', 'buttoned', 'pants', 'are', 'hitched', 'up', 'hair', 'cut', 'severely', 'then', 'have', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'look', 'Southern', 'fellow', 'mentally', 'deficient', 'can', 'run', 'fast', 'enough', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'career', 'highlight', 'good-hearted', 'bumpkin', 'way', 'honor', 'plot', 'juxtapositions', 'Hanks', 'solid', 'folksy', 'morals', 'versus', 'raw', 'evil', 'angry', 'ambiguity', 'mother', 'God', 'powerful', 'life-fulfilling', 'fuel.In', 'contrast', 'Forrest', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Jenny', 'lost', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'sexually', 'abused', 'cracker', 'daughter', 'plenty', 'smart', 'perceptive', 'enough', 'realize', 'Gump', 'sweet', 'friend', 'loyal', 'However', 'run', 'most', 'life', 'drugs', '60', 'rock', 'roll', 'then', 'LA', 'disco', 'coke', 'parties', 'Naturally', 'prodigal', 'returns', 'Forrest', 'physically', 'can', 'not', 'love', 'spiritually', 'not', 'find', 'peace', 'lifestyle', 'demons', 'seeking', 'comfort', 'Forrest', 'arms', 'then', 'bittersweet', 'finale.To', 'booster', 'theory', 'Gary', 'Sinese', 'Gump', 'Vietnam', 'Lt', 'legs', 'battle', 'Gump', 'Medal', 'Honor', 'saving', 'platoon', 'Sinese', 'too', 'Lt.', 'Dan', 'military', 'family', 'bitter', 'lost', 'legs', 'rather', 'dying', 'heroically', 'Again', 'again', 'Sinese', 'post-Vietnam', 'life', 'turmoil', 'flabbergasted', 'Gump', 'successes', 'good', 'Lt.is', 'bitter', 'cups', 'Later', 'shrimp', 'boat', 'storm', 'scene', 'Sinese', 'Secular', 'Hollywood', 'God', 'literally', 'baptized', 'Does', 'Sinese', 'really', 'have', 'legs', 'not', 'Amazing', 'special', 'effect', 'used', 'actor', 'stumps', 'Ya', 'got', 'Yes', 'religious', 'message', 'are', 'ruled', 'destiny', 'float', 'air', 'feather', 'simultaneously', 'obvious', 'Christian', 'message', 'never', 'spoken', 'PC', 'crowd', 'grapples', 'eternity']",N/A

But then he also describes Kevin Costner as ""an intelligent actor"".Luckily, this film reaches the apex of its tastelessness early on, when Forrest's disingenuous voice-over narration accompanies actual footage of George Wallace getting gunned down. At least the producers avoid (though only just) treating us to the same for the Kennedy brothers. Presumably George Wallace, as a redneck, doesn't deserve the privacy accorded to Boston bluebloods.The film constantly pokes fun at people and institutions - Black Panthers, hippies, drug addicts, the mentally retarded, the Army, war, the Presidency, and so on - without staying anywhere long enough to develop any redeeming satirical bite; staying just long enough to get the ... laugh and move on. Hanks is a great technician, as are his helpers, who cannot resist, for example, yet another chance to do the blue-screen trick with Gary Sinise's legs. And so far from ""rubbing my eyes at the realism"" of the anti-war rally scene (as Ebert says), by this time all I could say was ""another damn trick"".

It seems to have everything: crisp direction, outstanding acting, a compelling narrative, life lessons worthy of affirmation, highly innovative special effects, and a soundtrack whose CD continues to be a bestseller. It received and deserved five Academy Awards and could have received others as well. Of special interest to me is director Robert Zemeckis and his crew's brilliant integration of material from Winston Groom's novel with historical material in the 1960s and 1970s. I am not referring to Sonny Shroyer as Paul (""Bear"") Bryant or Peter Dobson as a young Elvis Presley; rather, to the inclusion of footage of John F. Kennedy and George W. Wallace in scenes in which Forrest (Tom Hanks) appears. What is fact? What is fiction? Who cares?Another question: ""Where's Forrest?"" At various points in his life, he is outrunning childhood tormentors on bicycles, scoring touchdowns for the University of Alabama, attending a White House reception, proving himself worthy of a Congressional Medal of Honor for heroism in Viet Nam, attending a major peace rally at the Lincoln Memorial, launching what becomes a highly profitable shrimp company named in honor of a Viet Nam comrade, defeating international ping pong champions, creating a ""smiley face"" which makes another person wealthy, jogging thousands of miles throughout the United States, re-settling in his family home, reuniting with a young son he did not know he had, marrying his beloved Jenny....Some people have told me they think this film is ""corny"" and that Forrest is ""dumb."" If ""Stupid is as stupid does,"" what he accomplishes suggests otherwise.  However, who he is as a person is far more important to me. I admire Forrest because he is a thoroughly decent man whose wisdom cannot be measured by I.Q. tests or net worth. I would be proud to have him as a son or son-in-law, as the father of my grandchildren, and as a next-door neighbor. Who wouldn't?FYI: The special features which supplement the DVD version of this film are among the most informative I have examined thus far. Why is that not also true of so many other great films?

I have always liked Hanks as an actor, and here he puts in an unusual and yes, a brilliant performance.But the real star of the movie is America of the 50s through the early 80s.  The portion of the film that dealt with the Vietnam conflict was unforgettable, as we see large numbers of ordinary American boys swept into a conflict that they little understood.  Gary Sinise puts in a very creditable performance as Lt. Dan, Forrest's platoon leader in Vietnam for whom the war is a personal tragedy.The film hilariously shows Forrest Gump navigate through many of the key events in history during the periods.  He meets Elvis and influences his style.  He meets President Kennedy. He has a ringside seat in the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s. He is caught up in the Vietnam War.  He meets President Nixon and inadvertantly triggers the Watergate scandal (this part is really a hoot).  The film's portrayal of the hippies and radicals of the 60s is particularly funny and in fact rings true.This is a film that almost everyone will like, and which will touch even the most hard-boiled viewer.

There is the story of &quot;Gump&quot; in a nutshell.

This movie is a hilarious, emotional, dramatic, and capturing tale of a man with a simple Anti-Socratic philosophy of life. He does nothing more than what  he is told to do. Soon enough he runs his way into a great deal of  excitement as well as danger. This is a movie I thought would be an  incredibly frivolous waste of time when I saw advertisements on television.  A dullard that accomplishes so much and is strategically placed at many  major events of the last thirty years seemed like a lousy idea. I was  pleasantly surprised when I placed my buttocks upon my seat in the theatre.  The score made me feel part of this movie from the start. The young actor  and actress playing Forest and Jenny started the film off great. The  narration by Tom Hanks worked great from the start as well. Gary Senise and  Robin Wright Penn were very moving as Lt. Dan and the adult Jenny and Bubba  was a great character too. The comedic use of the old cut scenes with the  presidents and such were fabulously done technically and worked well as  comic relief. They were designed to merely poke fun at those times. In a  realistic sense they don't affect the real story that much at all. The real  tale of Forest Gump is the romance between Forest Gump and his childhood  sweetheart Jenny. Robert Zemekis pushes all the right buttons when it comes  to this aspect of the movie. I ended up feeling sad for both Forest and  Jenny. The theme is truly a moving one. Forest's shortsightedness is his  greatest strength as well as his greatest weakness. Jenny could have been  saved if Forest had a greater understanding of the situations she was  putting herself in and how she was hurting herself. His inability to do  anymore than what he is told prevents him from getting the one thing he  wanted, Jenny. He becomes rich, a war hero, a famous athlete, and a good  citizen capable of providing in his community.

The most a  film can do is change our lives forever, and Forrest Gump does  that.AHHHHHH! People reading your reviews is painful. Please realize  what you are seeing!Forrest Gump is a METAPHOR, a parable of America.Why do you think he journey's through the late 20th century? Its not an  accident. Gump is a message to us, that if we stick to our MORAL COMPASS,  we could even be retarded and things will work out. We don't know this.  Jenny represents us--America who does not stay true to her moral compass  and she flounders, yet time and time again Gump, the living embodiment of a  moral compass comes to rescue her. The point of Gump's dim-wittedness is to  contrast more clearly that the thing that brings him success is his  goodness. This is something we evidently have forgotten all about in  America and we need to be reminded.We begin with Forrest as a boy who  falls in love with a girl who stands by him against some bullies. When we  find that she is being abused by her father and she asks that she wished  she were a bird to fly away and Forrest prays for her, with God arranging  for her to be rescued by a relative taking custody, most human beings would  be moved to tears at this point. The prayers of the simple and pure of  heart are answered. This theme of Jenny wishing she could fly away  continues throughout the film. She can't fly but she does teach Forrest to  run, and run he does. With his pure heart, he goes far, to the crimson Tide  football campus, to Vietnam, to Red China, to a shrimp boat...As the  years go by, anchored by Forrest being involved with every event, Jenny  goes astray and Forrest tries to rescue her. The scene where he decks the  militant boyfriend who slapped her shows that he is not some weakling, but  a U.S. Army Soldier who loves his woman as much as he loves his country!The relationship of Forrest with Lt. Dan is beautiful as despite all the  bitterness and rage the latter feels towards life, Forrest reminds him,  &quot;You are still Lt. Dan&quot;. And this is the central thing, its the  fact that we are each unique and ourselves that makes us worthwhile, not  any act or achievement. Forrest achieves mightily but he knows that his  value is that he is himself and he only wishes to be with his Jenny. True  love gives and doesn't expect to be returned. If we had more people with  half their intellects and replaced that with half of Forrest's heart we  would be in great shape today.That is the message of Forrest Gump---the  feather is having the right attitude to always be able to fly no matter  where the wind takes you, to keep your humanity and do what is right no  matter what.The sad ending reminds us that we have to intervene and  protect people early, and to cherish the ones we love today before its too  late. O, I wished the Jenny at the end of the film was that way earlier on,  sensible, beautiful, competent, why did she have to go through so many hard  knocks in life to get there. Maybe some of the women watching the film will  see her journey and arrive at that point a womanhood sooner with happier  endings. To men, I say be selfless like Forrest is and devote your lives to  others as a protector and have a moral compass.A great film, my review  above does not do it justice.",5,Realize the film's true message: have a moral compass,966729600,"08 20, 2000",2000,3412,"['One', 'greatest', 'movies', 'time', 'top', '3', 'JFK', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'need', 'ask', 'can', 'film', 'do', 'most', 'film', 'can', 'do', 'change', 'lives', 'forever', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'that.AHHHHHH', 'People', 'reading', 'reviews', 'painful', 'Please', 'realize', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'METAPHOR', 'parable', 'America.Why', 'do', 'think', 'journey', 'late', '20th', 'century', 'not', 'accident', 'Gump', 'message', 'stick', 'MORAL', 'COMPASS', 'could', 'even', 'be', 'retarded', 'things', 'will', 'work', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Jenny', 'America', 'who', 'not', 'stay', 'true', 'moral', 'compass', 'flounders', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'Gump', 'living', 'embodiment', 'moral', 'compass', 'rescue', 'point', 'Gump', 'dim-wittedness', 'contrast', 'more', 'clearly', 'thing', 'success', 'goodness', 'something', 'evidently', 'have', 'forgotten', 'America', 'need', 'be', 'reminded.We', 'begin', 'Forrest', 'boy', 'who', 'love', 'girl', 'who', 'bullies', 'When', 'find', 'being', 'abused', 'father', 'wished', 'were', 'bird', 'fly', 'away', 'Forrest', 'prays', 'God', 'arranging', 'be', 'rescued', 'relative', 'taking', 'custody', 'most', 'human', 'beings', 'would', 'be', 'moved', 'tears', 'point', 'prayers', 'simple', 'pure', 'heart', 'are', 'answered', 'theme', 'Jenny', 'wishing', 'could', 'fly', 'away', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fly', 'teach', 'Forrest', 'run', 'run', 'pure', 'heart', 'far', 'crimson', 'Tide', 'football', 'campus', 'Vietnam', 'Red', 'China', 'shrimp', 'boat', 'years', 'go', 'anchored', 'Forrest', 'being', 'involved', 'event', 'Jenny', 'astray', 'Forrest', 'tries', 'rescue', 'scene', 'where', 'militant', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'slapped', 'not', 'weakling', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'Soldier', 'who', 'woman', 'as', 'much', 'country', 'relationship', 'Forrest', 'Lt.', 'Dan', 'beautiful', 'bitterness', 'rage', 'latter', 'feels', 'towards', 'life', 'Forrest', 'quot', 'are', 'still', 'Lt.', 'Dan', 'quot', 'central', 'thing', 'fact', 'are', 'unique', 'worthwhile', 'not', 'act', 'achievement', 'Forrest', 'mightily', 'value', 'only', 'be', 'Jenny', 'True', 'love', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'returned', 'had', 'more', 'people', 'intellects', 'replaced', 'half', 'Forrest', 'heart', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'shape', 'message', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'feather', 'having', 'right', 'attitude', 'always', 'be', 'able', 'fly', 'matter', 'where', 'wind', 'keep', 'humanity', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'matter', 'what.The', 'sad', 'ending', 'have', 'intervene', 'protect', 'people', 'early', 'cherish', 'ones', 'love', 'today', 'too', 'late', 'O', 'wished', 'Jenny', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'way', 'earlier', 'sensible', 'beautiful', 'competent', 'why', 'did', 'have', 'go', 'so', 'many', 'hard', 'knocks', 'life', 'get', 'there', 'women', 'watching', 'film', 'will', 'see', 'journey', 'arrive', 'point', 'womanhood', 'sooner', 'happier', 'endings', 'men', 'say', 'be', 'selfless', 'Forrest', 'devote', 'lives', 'others', 'protector', 'have', 'moral', 'compass.A', 'great', 'film', 'review', 'not', 'do', 'justice']",N/A

It is a magical mystery tour through the formative times of the baby boom generation, with a simple and guileless man as our guide. Forrest Gump is like the literary character created by Richard Powell, whose ""strength is as the strength of ten because his heart is pure"". The world around him spins like a top, slowly wobbling until it falls, and through it all Forrest's simple character acts like a rudder in the water. He steers us through exciting and troubled times, from the rise of Elvis to the fall of Vietnam, the cynicism of Watergate and the nasty hangovers from free love that wasn't so free and one too many trips on the Marrakesh Express. The movie deftly captures this space in time with the perfect blend of music (that just slaps you in the head with its freshness and lack of premeditation) and images that are culled from the back pages of your mind.

Well, Hollywood has a knack for making empty films that say nothing and mean nothing.  However, every so often, they get it right AND the films wins Best Picture.I can think of only two other Best Picture examples that compare to Forrest Gump in their appeal, their scope, their grandeur, their humor, their characters, and their place in Hollywood...Gone With The Wind and All About Eve.  Why?Because each focused on a central character whose existence both set and altered the course of all those they encountered.  I am no true fan of the very one-note Tom Hanks, but, his face is one of the sweetest images ever captured on film as Forrest Gump.  It is remarkable, truly.The supporting cast is no less than perfect, however, the best supporting act in this film has been largely overlooked.  Alan Silvestri's score.  Listen to his suite as it appears on the double cd soundtrack.  Magnificent.  I defy anyone to listen to that on loud, and not be moved or inspired.  In fact, the Academy, finally understanding the importance of music and that comedy films and dramatic films cannot possibly compete against each other, divided the Original Score category the following year.  However, it was one year too late, as Forrest Gump's score lost to the bland and generic Lion King score.If you have seen Forrest Gump and loved it, you already know what I mean.  If you haven't seen Forrest Gump, you must only see it on DVD or Letterboxed VHS.  YOU CANNOT SEE A CROPPED VERSION!

While this dvd will not be gracing my shelves, I am forced to admit that this was a remarkably put-together piece of entertainment. It kept my interest from beginning to end, with plenty of laughs, surprises, and excitement. Note, however, that this is the ClearPlay review. The cleaned up version takes out the nudity, the violence, and the profanity which would otherwise have seen this film in the garbage, if I had seen it. Happily, I did not, and as usual, the film is much better without this stuff. Even still, there are quite a lot of themes inappropriate for children (or adults for that matter). This film does not paint a pretty picture of the past few decades, which is perhaps why many people don't like it. Personally, I think it was just brutally honest. Being told from the perspective of a ""slow"" person gives the filmmakers that liberty of telling the story with a child's simplicity and honesty. The truth is, life wasn't good then, and it isn't any better now, 17 years after the making. But this is not a film meant to depress. The comedy succeeds thanks to Tom Hanks believable acting. Does he act accurately as someone who is ""slow""? Probably not, but that wasn't the point. This isn't a treatise on a medical condition. The film bravely tackles almost every key issue of the times, leaving the viewer to come to his or her own conclusions, and thus is not ""mindless"" as some have accused it of being.

Well, Forrest Gump has done nothing but shut those people up.  Tom Hanks stars as a slow-witted Southerner named Forrest Gump.  The film shows about 30 years of his life and our nation's life.  Forrest always manages to be around when something big is going on in America whether it be Vietnam or the Watergate Scandal.Forrest starts out as child living with his single mother(Sally Field) in the South.  Forrest's only friend besides his mother is a young girl named Jenny who turns out to be the love of Forrest's life.  Early in life Forrest needs leg braces for his crooked legs which starts up the comedy in the film.  He then grows up to play football and turns out to be an All-American.  He then joins the army and meets his best friend and shrimp fanatic Bubba.  They go to Vietnam together where Forrest is struck with his first of many hard blows.  He also meets his future friend Lt. Dan(Gary Sinsie) in Vietnam.  While in the war Forrest is shot in the ""buttox"" and is hospitalized.  It is in the hospital that Forrest realizes he is exceptionally skilled in the sport if ping-pong.  After the war Forrest joins the national Ping-Pong team.  Forrest then buys a shrimping boat and begins working alone.  He is later joined by war vet/friend Lt. Dan.  The two end up getting rich off of the business.  Forrest then returns home where his mother is sick and decides to mow lawns.  Jenny later revisits Forrest  and the two live together for a while.  She later leaves him and this is when Forrest begins his 3-year long jogging spree back and fourth across the country.  After his run Forrest gets a letter from Jenny and decides to visit her.  He then learns that Jenny has had his son.  I won't tell you the rest, you'll just have to buy it and watch it for yourself.Forrest Gump is a heart-moving, and humourous movie that the whole family can watch.

That is what clinches it for most people. It does all of the above, and is heartwarming as well. So they get this DVD and sit down with loved ones on a Saturday evening with a large bucket of ice cream and let it all wash over.All of this is fine, but I merely wish to use this forum to express my reservations with the central plot. This is a movie that traces the life of one man. We are asked to feel sorry for this man, sympathise with him, love him and root for him all the way to come good in the end. Personally, I never felt this with Forrest. Basically, he accomplishes too much too easily. He is born half crippled but instantaneously shakes off his crutches to run away from bullies, he is an unwitting Vietnam War hero, he inspires John Lennon to write 'Imagine', he meets and charms three US Presidents, he becomes a shrimp millionaire after a storm wipes out the rest of the industry and, yes, he gets the girl in the end. All of this is accomplished with relative ease. Where is the adversity? Why should we care, deep down for this man? It is touched on. There are several sensitive moments during the movie, such as when Forrest crumbles into tears on discovering that he has an illegitimate son. But these need to be developed far more fully to turn him into a developed hero. As the movie stands, he is more annoying than heroic. Imagine a kid at school who has no apparent ability but sails through life achieving almost anything. Is that a great story? No, it's a tremendously baffling annoyance.There are heroes in the story, but they are the supporting characters to Forrest rather than Forrest himself. Gary Sinise as the legless Vietnam veteran is pretty funny as he goes through various stages of denial and alcoholism before coming to terms with his condition. And Jenny, his sweetheart suffers the tribulations of the last decades of the 20th Century far more realistically than Forrest.

Sarhan ""matured reviewer""","[4, 7]","Forrest Gump is a mesmerizing and epical movie directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back To The Future), and starring Tom Hanks (Big) as Forrest, Sally Field (Mrs. Doubtfire) as Forrest's mother, Robin Wright Penn (State Of Grace) as Jenny, Gary Sinise (Ransom) as Lt. Dan Taylor, and Mykelti Williamson (Heat) as Bubba.Tom Hanks shines as the dim-witted southern simpleton named Forrest Gump who loves his country, his mother, and his only childhood friend Jenny, and that's about it.The film follows Forrest through an inspiring journey from his childhood in the 50's through his college years and Vietnam in the 60's, to his admirably successful shrimping business venture and settling down with a family which concludes in the early 80's. And throughout this incredible journey, Forrest has no clue how great a person he is and becomes.We get to share history as it unfolds with Forrest through the simple mind of Forrest himself. We get to meet different people who mark a significance in Forrest's life: his Vietnam buddy, an African American simpleton named Bubba, who constantly talks about shrimps and an interest in starting a shrimping business after the war, Forrest's superior officer in the war, Lt. Dan Taylor, who's saved by Forrest against his will and in the process loses both of his legs. On top of all that, we're amazed at how Forrest gets to meet three US presidents: John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon; and musical icons Elvis Presley and John Lennon, and make history as he becomes a state football champion, a national war hero, and America's ambassador to China as a ping pong player.Forrest Gump will take you along on his thrilling, funny, and sometimes sad trip through his very simple but stunning life, and you will be unable to pull away from it, not even for a minute.Another important feature in the film is the soundtrack which covers each period with the songs that defined the era.RecommendedA",5,...a mesmerizing and epical movie,1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,1935,"['Forrest', 'Gump', 'mesmerizing', 'epical', 'movie', 'directed', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'Back', 'Future', 'starring', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Big', 'Forrest', 'Sally', 'Field', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'Forrest', 'mother', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'State', 'Grace', 'Jenny', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'Ransom', 'Lt.', 'Dan', 'Taylor', 'Mykelti', 'Williamson', 'Heat', 'Bubba.Tom', 'Hanks', 'shines', 'dim-witted', 'southern', 'simpleton', 'named', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'who', 'country', 'mother', 'only', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Jenny', 'it.The', 'film', 'Forrest', 'inspiring', 'journey', 'childhood', '50', 'college', 'years', 'Vietnam', '60', 'admirably', 'successful', 'shrimping', 'business', 'venture', 'settling', 'down', 'family', 'early', '80', 'incredible', 'journey', 'Forrest', 'clue', 'how', 'great', 'person', 'becomes.We', 'get', 'share', 'history', 'Forrest', 'simple', 'mind', 'Forrest', 'get', 'meet', 'different', 'people', 'who', 'mark', 'significance', 'Forrest', 'life', 'Vietnam', 'buddy', 'African', 'American', 'simpleton', 'named', 'Bubba', 'who', 'constantly', 'shrimps', 'interest', 'starting', 'shrimping', 'business', 'war', 'Forrest', 'superior', 'officer', 'war', 'Lt.', 'Dan', 'Taylor', 'who', 'saved', 'Forrest', 'will', 'process', 'legs', 'top', ""'re"", 'amazed', 'how', 'Forrest', 'meet', 'three', 'US', 'presidents', 'John', 'Kennedy', 'Lyndon', 'Johnson', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'musical', 'icons', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'John', 'Lennon', 'make', 'history', 'state', 'football', 'champion', 'national', 'war', 'hero', 'America', 'ambassador', 'China', 'ping', 'pong', 'player.Forrest', 'Gump', 'will', 'take', 'along', 'thrilling', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'sad', 'trip', 'very', 'simple', 'stunning', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'unable', 'pull', 'away', 'not', 'even', 'minute.Another', 'important', 'feature', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'period', 'songs', 'defined', 'era.RecommendedA']",N/A

This is actually one of my all-time favorites. I usually find myself disappearing into this movie during flu season and when I'm confined to the couch for a week suffering in pain. Watching Forrest Gump seems to make things better, sooner.While that might sound corny, and you might be rolling your eyes, I usually feel better every time just watching it. The truth about the success of this movie is that most people identify with it, because unless you're a sycophantic sociopath, there are many times when the majority of us feel inferior, or less than or unable to meet the demands of our life - rendering us a little blue, sad, debilitated ... take your pick. Knowing that there is someone in the world like Forrest, probably gives us the hope that you're going to be alright if you hang on and don't obsess on your flaws. Forrest Gump is a lot of different things to different people. Mostly, it just takes you out of whatever you're in and does a pretty consistent job at making you feel that much better. Even if it's just for a little while.I'll spare you the repetitious information regarding any technical information about the DVD or the cast, as to date there are 543 reviews on this, 397 ""5 star"" and 42 ""1 star"", and 10 pages of posts on IMDb.Another reviewer stated that this was an introspective look into the Baby Boomers generation, and while I've never been a fan of the Baby Boomers per se, as most of the would-be flower children that briefly took up residences in communes, would later switch-off and drift into the largest group of corporate raiders in the history of this nation. Not much of a legacy there. But the character of Forrest speaks to more than just one single generation, or even one single man or one journey. Forrest Gump is an amalgam of several people, this according to Winston Groom and the reason why so many people identify with it.

126603,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,0792140923,Steve Douglas,"[5, 6]","Still do not understand Amazon's policy of not separating reviews of Standard DVDs from downloaded streaming movies from Blu Ray DVDs.  They should all be separated even if it demands more effort and work of the Amazon employees.There is much discussion elsewhere on this film in terms of plot summary, meaning, and value so I won't get into that. My reviews are strictly regarding the transfer from Standard Definition to Blu Ray. I did not have the Standard Def version so this is not a comparison between the two.The video transfer was completely free of any artifacting, stair stepping or aliasing.  The overall image was a touch soft without that hard edged video look typical of many current films.  While there was no noticeable grain, the soft appearance did not interfere with the warm color grading and imaging throughout the film.  While not deserving of video 'DEMO status', the video transfer was quite good.The audio transfer is DTS HD 5.1 and was nicely spread across the front stage.  There is some nice panning to the discreets but not very much through most of the film.  The only time your audio system will come to life, especially your sub channel, is during the wartime explosion scenes.  Even then there is very little use of the discreet rear channels being  used for anything other than general ambience rather than discreet foley fx.  Never the less, the  lossless audio is nicely balanced and dialogue clear.  It should be noted that in  the beginning of the film I had to turn the volume up past where I normally set it for most films.  This tells me that the audio levels during editing were set lower than most and once I  boosted my own audio level, all was fine and dandy.Since I do not have the Standard Def version I can't make a recommendation that this is better than the Standard Def.  However, the Sapphire Series of BluRay DVDs generally boast of greatly improved mastering of a film to Blu Ray so my guess is that making the move from your SD version to this Blu Ray would be a major upgrade, especially so for the video transfer.  This is because soft focus films like this generally produce more noticeable grain in SD than BR.I didn't have time to watch all the extras, and there are a great many, but I did watch the 6 or 7 screen tests which were very enjoyable and charming.  I would rather have more screen tests on discs than those wasteful previews of other movies that we see far too often and cause us to pay for a company's advertisements rather than improved BR imaging.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",4,Forrest Gump on Blu Ray-Sapphire Series 2 disc collection,1355875200,"12 19, 2012",2012,2864,"['Still', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'Amazon', 'policy', 'not', 'separating', 'reviews', 'Standard', 'DVDs', 'downloaded', 'streaming', 'movies', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'DVDs', 'should', 'be', 'separated', 'even', 'more', 'effort', 'work', 'Amazon', 'much', 'discussion', 'elsewhere', 'film', 'terms', 'plot', 'summary', 'meaning', 'value', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'reviews', 'are', 'strictly', 'regarding', 'transfer', 'Standard', 'Definition', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'Standard', 'Def', 'version', 'so', 'not', 'comparison', 'two.The', 'video', 'transfer', 'was', 'completely', 'free', 'artifacting', 'stair', 'stepping', 'aliasing', 'overall', 'image', 'was', 'touch', 'soft', 'hard', 'edged', 'video', 'look', 'typical', 'many', 'current', 'films', 'was', 'noticeable', 'grain', 'soft', 'appearance', 'did', 'not', 'interfere', 'warm', 'color', 'grading', 'imaging', 'film', 'not', 'deserving', 'video', 'status', 'video', 'transfer', 'was', 'quite', 'good.The', 'audio', 'transfer', 'DTS', 'HD', '5.1', 'was', 'nicely', 'spread', 'front', 'stage', 'nice', 'panning', 'discreets', 'not', 'very', 'much', 'most', 'film', 'only', 'time', 'audio', 'system', 'will', 'come', 'life', 'especially', 'sub', 'channel', 'wartime', 'explosion', 'scenes', 'Even', 'then', 'very', 'little', 'use', 'discreet', 'rear', 'channels', 'being', 'used', 'anything', 'other', 'general', 'ambience', 'rather', 'discreet', 'foley', 'fx', 'less', 'lossless', 'audio', 'nicely', 'balanced', 'dialogue', 'clear', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'beginning', 'film', 'had', 'turn', 'volume', 'up', 'where', 'normally', 'set', 'most', 'films', 'audio', 'levels', 'editing', 'were', 'set', 'lower', 'most', 'once', 'boosted', 'own', 'audio', 'level', 'was', 'fine', 'dandy.Since', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'Standard', 'Def', 'version', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'recommendation', 'better', 'Standard', 'Def', 'However', 'Sapphire', 'Series', 'BluRay', 'DVDs', 'generally', 'boast', 'greatly', 'improved', 'mastering', 'film', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'guess', 'making', 'move', 'SD', 'version', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'would', 'be', 'major', 'upgrade', 'especially', 'so', 'video', 'transfer', 'soft', 'focus', 'films', 'generally', 'produce', 'more', 'noticeable', 'grain', 'SD', 'BR.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'watch', 'extras', 'are', 'great', 'many', 'did', 'watch', '6', '7', 'screen', 'tests', 'were', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'charming', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'more', 'screen', 'tests', 'discs', 'wasteful', 'previews', 'other', 'movies', 'see', 'far', 'too', 'often', 'cause', 'pay', 'company', 'advertisements', 'rather', 'improved', 'BR', 'imaging.All', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'BluRay', 'so', 'check', 'see', 'are', 'help', 'well.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",N/A

""Pop Culture Addict""","[5, 14]","Robert Zemeckis' ""Forrest Gump"" is a spirited venture that gets off to a dazzling start but is torpedoed by a second half that is mundane and sappy.  Tom Hanks turns in a wonderful performance but neither he nor the impressive technology on display can save the day in the end.Forrest Gump (Hanks) and his mother (Sally Field) lead a modest existence in Greenbow, Alabama.  Forrest is not blessed with a great degree of intelligence but as he gets older, his good-nature and his honesty along with a series of strange twists lead him to fame and glory as a sports star, a war hero, a successful businessman, and a celebrity.  Yet, even with so much going on around him, it is always the wisdom of his mother and his love for Jenny Curran (Robin Wright) that is foremost on his mind.""Forrest Gump"" is best when it follows Forrest in his journey through history.  Watching him partake in some of the most important events of the 20th century and seeing him interact with such real-life figures as George Wallace, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, and John Lennon reminds one of just how magical the film medium can be.  However, when ""Forrest Gump"" starts to focus on the Forrest and Jenny love story, it crosses over into routine soap-opera territory.  All of the innovation present in the first half is tossed aside in favor of a clich&eacute;d and routine tale of love and loss.  Hanks, Wright, Field, Gary Sinise, and Mykelti Williamson are great but ""Forrest Gump"" the film proves to be somewhat less than satisfying.",2,"""Her dream had come true.

A much more credible performance about a mentally challenged person is given in the excellent movie: ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape.""

But I will do my best to tell you how this movie has affected me. Every one of you has seen this film. The whole world has seen this film. There is nothing I can say to those millions of you who have seen this All I can do, is give you my review.I will not go into detail. You already know every scene, every line. I just really wanted to have my say posted by Amazon.The obligatory `cliff note' is Tom Hanks plays the part of a mentally challenged man whose life interacts unwittingly with persons of fame and politics.  He has no ides of the impact he has in people's lives. and simply sees the world `as it is', and yearns for the love of his life, his Jenny. In fact, everything he does, is driven by his love for Jenny.You will never EVER see a better performance by Gary Sinese, as the physically and severely soul wounded Lt. Dan. EVERYTHING he has done since this movie, is compared to this role. Robin Wright Penn will never have a role as perfect as she had as Jenny, the woman he has loved since childhood, but shuns him repeatedly, in search of her own life. And as to Tom Hanks? Well, he is one of the premier actors of the modern era, and his performance in Forest Gump eclipses even his role in `The Green Mile' (my other favorite film). Hanks so `under-plays' his simple-minded Gump character, to the point of diamond brilliance. In the end, he finally get's his life's desire, and hears the words he waited for his whole life, from Jenny...""I love you"". And then, she is sadly gone. But we get a glimpse of a whole new beginning in his life, with his son (played by Haley Joel Osment).Yeah, I know there is nothing new in this review that really describes the film. My point was, is, watch this movie on DVD as often as you can. Not only will it enthrall you, it may just make you a better person.

126623,A1SDPA1J98UP4L,0792140923,"THE AUTISTIC WEREWOLF ""Wolf""","[17, 19]","Forrest Gump is a very hard movie to watch since I am an autistic physically disabled black dude who grew up in the racially charged 1960's.  I had always heard so much about Forrest Gump that made me not think it was the kind of movie I'd like watching so I usually avoided it with a passion.  Suddenly this Christmas friends of mine roped in into sitting through Forrest Gump and I was shocked by how much I absolutely loved this movie.The movie is vivid fictionalized but oddly realistic life seen through (disabled kid) Forrest Gump's eyes.  Forrest Gump's perspective on life was weird but strange as he was the movie felt real in the oddest ways I could imagine.  It is true watching life unfold through Forrest Gump's eyes offers a perspective that leaves you altered for the better if you have any heart and soul at all.  I owe this movie a huge appology because for years I just knew in my heart I'd hate Forrest Gump yet I ended up loving that it was so much like my own life experience growing up disabled in the 1960's when you got very little encouragement and help as a special needs kid.I suspect I disliked Forrest Gump because it came way too uncomfortably close to being exactly like my own life growing up disabled labelled the dummy or my neighborhood retard by grown ups and peers alike.  Like Forrest I had family members (grandparents mainly) who loved me and fought hard, long and tirelessly to be sure I had the same opportunities for advancement other kids had.  I saw the park bench scene in the movie trailer and felt it was acted way too simplistically almost as if the movie was poking fun at or making light of the disabled so I never wanted to watch it.  Forrest Gump threatened to reopen many painful memories from my own past growing up disabled and those sores were still sensitive in my heart so why watch it.I am much stronger as a disabled person now than I have ever been before so I let myself be roped into watching Forrest Gump.  I liked and understood myself now so I risked veiwing Forrest Gump this Christmas Eve surrounded by friends.  Anyways this Christmas Eve friends wanted me to see the Forrest Gump DVD after hearing I had still never seen it so I saw the movie from beginning to end.  Watching Forrest Gump was still very painful because, I experienced personally so much of the torment Forrest did going to regular school as a disabled kid in the mid 60's myself.  More than a few times I wanted to leave the movie and just go sit in a corner, retreat into my own autistic world to cry tears of solidarity for Forrest Gump in a place where my heart was my only witness but I did not.  I stayed the course and watched the whole Forrest Gump movie despite my own pains being vigorously stirred. I gave my word to friends I'd watch to all of Forrest Gump and a Wolf without honor is no Wolf at all.Yes Forrest Gump stirred up some real painful experiences in my past but that said the movie answered some real unresolved questions I had leaving me much stronger, secure and prouder as a disabled man for my Forrest Gump experience.  In my eyes a truly good movie uses fiction to teach truth in ways that leaves an audience stronger better and more enlightened and in all these measures Forrest Gump excels so completely as to have no equals in its job of putting 1960's life with disability in honest perspective.  My grandparents used to insist I never see myself as disabled I was expected to do everything the normal folk did and for years I thought my grandparents were cruel almost to the point of being sadistic.  I had started to know my grandparents loved me.  Watching Forrest Gump showed me that expecting your disabled child to make his own way in normal society coping using tools he developed alone was the most difficult way to love a special needs child in the 1960's but it was the only way to encourage success back in those days when ignorant hostile cruelty about disabilities was rampant.I am successful today exactly because my grandparents pushed me forcing me to cope in the world of normal people until I got it right.  In my case it took me 41 years to get it right and it is still a daily struggle to live among normal folk but I do it.  I had hated and avoided watching Forrest Gump for the same reasons I love and highly reccomend buying it from AMAZON.COM now.  The Forrest Gump experience as wacky and off beat as it appears was really how it was to be cognitively and physically disabled in the 1960's.  For a long time Forrest Gump was too real.  Forrest Gump's message hit me way too close to home reminding me of things I'd rather forget and for those very same reasons I most highly recommend that you please buy Forrest Gump on DVD from Amazon.com because the story might be fiction but the 1960's disabled experince it shares is so REAL it can not honestly be deniedtake it from one who lived it!

Aside from the handsome production and Hanks's performance, this was an overall safe, fairly predictable little movie that pushed no boundaries and played by Hollywood's rules of filmmaking.  It was fun to see Hanks evolve in his character, but there was little dramatic thrust and it was even a little sappy.  Don't think I'm totally bashig this film; I just think that it's a tad overrated and didn't deserve Best Picture.

And each year, Forrest Gump proves itself abundantly deserving of both its Academy Award for Best Picture and its status as an amazon.com Essential Video.The film chronicles, from boyhood on, the life and times of a mentally slow but good-hearted and physically gifted Southerner.  In doing so, it recreates vibrantly and poignantly the most turbulent decades of change (the 60s and 70s) in twentieth century America.  It is thus the story of a man who remains innocent in the midst of a nation rapidly losing its innocence and, because of his difference, makes a difference.  Ultimately, it is a love story that, both throughout and in its sublime conclusion, dares to address the issue of free will versus predestination.  (And does so more successfully than any film--and perhaps any popular work of art.)Tom Hanks enters an amazing, tour de force performance, actually becoming the slow-witted but faithful Gump.  The tenderly stunning Robin Wright Penn and the perfectly-cast Gary Sinise shine in memorable supporting roles.  The soundtrack--a remarkable combination of original music, period-evoking songs, and haunting silence--is one of the best in recent memory.

There are just not words to describe its brilliance.  I first saw it at the theater, when it came out.  I was about 11, and it was almost too intense for me.  This movie is very much like a window into real life.  You get a look at pain, torment, racism, war violence, and the very essence of the human spirit.  And, it's all presented in a fairly simple manner, so as not to go over anyone's head.  The characters are all presented in fine form, and the acting is off the charts.  Tom Hanks is one of the greatest actors of all time, up there with Robin Williams and Nicolas Cage.  Gary Sinise is up there, too.  I have seen this movie countless times, and it never gets old.  Each viewing is like a thrilling journey, and even though you know where it's going, you can't wait to get there.  You've got comedy, action, drama, this movie transcends genres.

Forrest Gump is the ultimate movie in so many ways, there are so many sides to it. It's predominantly a `serious' film about a dim headed, yet good hearted southern boy and how the absence of a dysfunctional ego and a simple sense of honor and integrity enables him to flow through life effortlessly, like the metaphor of the white feather we see at the beginning and the end of the film.Forrest Gump is a masterfully written and directed tale that punctuates deep philosophical substance with a good deal of humor -the scene of Forrest and Bubba scrubbing the floor with toothbrushes while Bubba enlightens Forrest on the details of `shrimping' is just too funny for words. There's never been a film like it before or since. It ingeniously weaves the history of a generation into the script, taking scenes from the Vietnam war, JFK, the 60's protest movement and flower power, and onward into the age of AIDS.  Actual film clippings from various historical events are cleverly edited to enable Forrest to step into them and interact. Wonderful Stuff... it's kind of a nod to the `Wonder Years'.As richly entertaining as Forrest's life is, and as very funny as many of the scenes are, it's still the character of Forrest that carries the move. He's impossible not to like. You become significantly invested in his life. You share his heartbreak as Jenny repeated shuns the open heart he offers her. And you admire his quiet acceptance of 'what is'. His lack of self consciousness - devoid of the myriad games and manipulations that most people of `greater intelligence' display -his simple open heartedness and sense of personal integrity which he carries through life are inspirational. This clearly is a story that shows the ultimate triumph of virtue over the complex dysfunctions of the mind. Jenny plays out a sad character... always looking somewhere else for love, although she finds it on her death bed And Lt. Dan is just an awesome character. His 360 degree turn through what life deals him is as inspirational as Forrest's.The closing scene is the most memorable for me... the feather floats in the random breeze, as Forrest muses about predestination vs random existence: "" I think it's both... both happening at the same time."" - which leads me to believe our beloved Forrest isn't as dumb as he's portrayed.",5,"Heartwarming, deep and very, very funny.

I bet the video they were watching was ""Forrest Gump.""""Forrest Gump?""  An Orwellian trick?  Not sweet Forrest, who seems (on the surface at least) to personify all that is good and humble and admirable in the world.Don't get me wrong:  Forrest is a good man.  But that doesn't mean that the film in which he stars is actually expressing ""good"" values.In fact, ""Forrest Gump,"" fantastically realized as it is, is a cynical, calculating film.Before you get upset, let's step back and define terms.  Can we agree that  in an ideal world, a film (like any work of art) will express a view of life which is truthful?  That viewers who experience that work will come away not only entertained, but also invigorated, strengthened, and enriched?I raise this point because Hollywood producers have long understood the formula for manipulating mass audiences with over the top sentimentality.  Before Hollywood figured out the formula, the Greeks were already doing it.  Plato himself attacked the theatre because of its power to excite the senses and numb the mind.At its best, a Hollywood film can be riveting and inspirational:  look at To Kill a Mockingbird,  Singing in the Rain,  or Mary Poppins, for example.  Why do I love those films and why do I exclude Forrest Gump from their ranks?Because in all three cases (and innumerable other example could be cited) these films provoke in their audiences not not only wonder, but also the desire to interact with the world.  The children in ""Mockinbird"" experience injustice, but they also learn to accept ""Boo Radley,"" and, we presume, they will emulate their father as people who make a difference.  In ""Singing in the Rain,"" the plucky and talented prevail-- and will, we can expect-- spend a lifetime bringing joy to millions.  ""Mary Poppins"" goes away-- but not before Jane and Michael-- and the entire family-- are transformed-- and take their places in society, joining other Londoners in the park.The ""Forrest"" effect, on the other hand, is the opposite.  We are encouraged (no: frightened into the decision) to stay at home.  Only a fool would follow the other characters into harm's way.  The big world is depicted as chaotic, dangerous, and generally not worth it.  And anyway, if Forrest is any example,  staying at home is a surer road to riches.Don't get me wrong:  the idea of a wise fool is wonderful.  He appears in every culture.  But generally speaking, the story about the wise fool imparts wisdom.  If you look carefully at ""Forrest Gump"" you have 90% artificial flavoring. Because the outcomes in ""Forrest Gump"" are all rigged to reinforce the same idea:  city folk bad, Forrest, good.  Asking questions bad,  sitting on the porch swing good.Now I love sitting on porch swings.  I've sat on them (or on hammocks, or meadows, or snowfields) in over 50 countries of this world.  And everywhere I've gone I've met good people.  And the more I know the world, the less it looks like the world of ""Forrest Gump.""  Even in the worst zip codes of Los Angeles I've met people seeking to enrich their lives,  to interact with --and help-- others.  To change the world.The Forrest Gump world is different.  The world is bad.  And hard to understand anyway.  So, again, going out there-- into ""the arena"" in Teddy Roosevelt's words-- just isn't worth it.This is a dangerous idea, one that goes against the very fabric of what it means to be an American.  We are a nation of pioneers-- our future depends on our willingness to continue to be so.And so Forrest represents a myth of failure, of decline.  And it reinforces the correctness of the decision to escape from our destiny by telling viewers they made the right decision not to get involved.  Not to know to much.  Maybe even...not to know anything at all.In Ray Bradbury's ""Fahrenheit 451"" books are banned because they make people unhappy.  Why?  Because they tell uncomfortable truths.  Forrest Gump wouldn't fit that category, because it feels designed to tell certain people only what they want to hear.Of course, this isn't the only film to do so.In the market driven America of today,  a product is good if it reinforces the idea that the consumer is good.  Therefore, a movie is good if it makes the viewer feel good.Fair enough.  Hollywood has always been mostly about straightforward entertainment, right?Well, yes and no.In the days of classic Hollywood cinema, audiences could feel good by identifying with John Wayne's eternal outsider, Humphrey Bogart's code of honor,  Scarlett O'Hara's astonishing persistence, and Fred Astaire's grace-- a wide variety of human characteristics-- all of which-- in their complexity-- somehow made audiences of the time feel better they were.  Maybe because they enlarged the scope of what was felt to be human.In other words,  American consumers had the humility to identify with characters bigger, braver, and more foolish than they were themselves.  Characters who suffered and learned. This was, after all, the reason people exposed themselves to drama from the time of the Greeks.In today's consumerist America, however, audiences don't want to get their hair messed up.  Characters like Scarlett and Sam Spade seem too far from home for most of us.  We want to identify with characters like Forrest Gump, who gets it all without even trying.  Or Good Will Hunting, the world's greatest street fighter, legal eagle,  nuclear physicist, sleuth,  lover, and who knows what else.  And all he needed to get the girl was Robin Williams weeping over him and uttering the magic words: ""You're really good!""Unlike Sam Spade, Scarlett O'Hara, Shane, or Terry Malloy,  Forrest and Will-- the heroes for the Wal-Mart American--  don't really learn through suffering.  They don't have to:  they're perfect just the way they are.  The only thing wrong in their worlds is that everybody else didn't know how perfect they were before they made the movie.  And by buying a ticket, the audience gets to take part in the canonization...of their own egos.In other words, the FORREST GUMP consumer is a weak, selfish,  shallow, lazy narcissist, unable to bend his/her imagination to identify with characters who are flawed- and thus actually human.  In other words, this post-modern self-centered character would reject anything remotely human-- if somehow it got past the guards at the entrance to the shopping mall.Naturally the Consumer Creature will call a movie ""good"" if it allows him/her to remain in the bubble of their shallowness.  Otherwise, it's ""weird.""I guess that's why Wal-Mart doesn't have a big selection of real books, or jazz, or classical music.  Or why Shakespeare, and Mark Twain,  and Thomas Jefferson are excluded from the minds of the worst generation in the history of the country.  Hunter Thompson called them a ""generation of swine.""Viewed in this way, Forrest Gump is the Moby Dick of this generation.  It is the white whale of shallowness, and, I'm afraid,  it will take us all to the bottom of the ocean.Someday-- and maybe soon-- historians (perhaps in China, India, and Brazil-- countries where young people actually go to school to learn)  will view movies like this as a symptom of a culture in intellectual--and moral-- freefall.  They will say, that was when American stopped being a leader-- and started its descent.  (Of course, even if the U.S.A. morphs into a state of slave-workers for a future Chinese Empire, the workers drones will undoubtedly be told they are still number one, and they will go through life believing it.)Meanwhile, the future historians will look at Forrest in the pantheon of great characters in literature (Lear, Hamlet, Ahab...Finn,  Gump) and marvel at the capacity of the human being to rise--- and to fall.Forrest isn't, in fact, a character at all-- he's a ball of tricks designed to lure the audience's most infantile self inside.This is fascism as consumer culture.  It doesn't matter how technically impressive the movie is, or that the scene where Forrest runs can make anybody cry.  This is the American version of ""Triumph of the Will,""  the moment when it became practically illegal to have a mind.By the way,  Robert Zemeckis' former writing partner, Bob Gale, co-creator of the BACK TO THE FUTURE series (the only films Bob Zemeckis should truly be proud of, except for USED CARS) accused Zemeckis of cynicism when he made FORREST GUMP.  Zemeckis claims he doesn't understand the accusation, and I believe him.  I don't think he understands what cynicism is, or how this film so perfectly embodies it.  And that puts him into the 95% of America that hasn't the slightest idea what it means actually to think.  And how criminal it is not to.  Especially when you have the power.Again, to those of you who are offended by this comment,  why not stop to consider that maybe living a shallow life is even worse than being offended. In any case, history will judge you far more harshly than one writer possibly could.  Why not try to rouse yourselves from your slumber and join the world.  It's a lovely place.  Besides, do you really want to spend your life like those butterballs on the cruise space ship in WALL-E?As someone who lived through the sixties, I can tell you that the film itself is an insult to all the men and women who struggled and shed their blood in that time of striving.  And their blood was not wasted!  Voting rights, civil rights, environmental protection-- these are the fruits of that struggle.The proper heroes of a film about that time are the men and women who fought in Vietnam-- and against the war.  Who fought for civil rights, and against the haters.  Who reached for the moon-- and landed there.  Who experimented with new ways of creating society--and made discoveries which have enriched our lived.  Scientists and scholars and firefighters and farm workers and computer geeks and musicians.  Not a man-- sweet as he is-- who looked at it all and said none of it made sense.",1,brilliantly executed feel good device; a false view of history and of life,1258329600,"11 16,

126656,A3POUK5BO810DD,0792140923,T. Wu,"[4, 12]","This film might be taken to be many things--an autobiography, history, comedy, war film, but at its heart lies an allegorical sort of epitaph for a wild era in American history (1960s-70s); a psychological catharsis. (Warning: this review has spoilers)We seem to be told that everything about our protagonist derives from the singular trait that he is a little bit dumb. Yet there is more to Forrest Gump than being a little bit dumb. He is also a 'little bit' innocent, a 'little bit' hardworking, a 'little bit' selfless (and a 'little bit' lucky, at least in regards to his personal affairs). Ultimately, our narrator Forrest seems to fill the role of an angelic ideal, like Dante wandering through the depths of Hell in the Divine Comedy; like a man who has never eaten from the Tree of Knowledge stumbling through the depicted darkness of postwar America.T.S. Eliot once remarked, ""We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time""-- and this seems to apply aptly here. Each time we return to the bus bench with Forrest, at the end when we return to the feather, we see the same things, yet know their meaning for the first time. And has Jenny, the female charge of our angelic Dante, our bird which has flown far, far away, to college, to a singing career, through the antiwar movement, waitressing, and finally an AIDS victim, arrived back where she started in that wheat field behind her father's home: alone with Forrest by her side, only to know him, his simple kind of love, for the first time? (It's an interesting plug for all the 'Nice Guys' who can never get a break, isn't it?)Yet unlike what perhaps this film suggests, Jenny was not wrong to want to fly (even if the directions of that flight were not as fortuitous), and we should not refrain from exploring in life for ourselves. Forrest certainly never did, even though for him it was an inadvertent journey. His saintly character seems at one level to be a stunning example of some writer's indictment by contrast of American culture-- presumably his own generation. Yet the morality play only works because our stories of Gump's earthly charges-- Bubba, ""Lt. Dan"", Jenny, are tragic ones-- while Forrest's is not. As if God's hand in his infinite justice were reaching down and placing the virtuous Gump in the most opportune positions, even as the world seems lost around him. Unfortunately, us mortals in the real world cannot truly live up to the model this movie holds forth. Imperfect and living in a world where guile and self-interest pay off, descended from the fallen Adam and Eve, we are more like Lt. Dan and Jenny than Forrest.Yet the tragic characters herein aside, it is important to remember that the risks inherent in life, and the moral sacrifices to self-interest sometimes required, are never a justification for turning one's back on it, even if none of us will be as effortlessly successful as Forrest. Let us not take from this a message of despair. It is not necessary to be an angelic idiot in order to do substantial good in this world. And if our explorations in life bring us back to that place where we started, if complexity's chaos and confusion become brittle and melt into love, it is also true that love compels us to live life nonetheless, to pursue our dreams and fly as far as we can. (Even if only so that perhaps one day, we may look back again at what we had at the beginning with understanding eyes, and know it for the first time).The final scene in this film shows young Forrest Jr. boarding a school bus, the smartest kid in his class (thus presumably an imperfect mortal, like his mother), ready to face life's new adventures. Where will it lead him? None of us would deny him the chance to find out. So, if this film inspired in you a thoughtful catharsis, I would think of it not as an indictment of a postwar generation that reached out ambitiously and optimistically, or of a culture uniquely American, but as a place of wisdom from which to begin again.",3,It is not necessary to be an angelic idiot to do substantial good in this world,1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,4069,"['film', 'might', 'be', 'taken', 'be', 'many', 'things', 'autobiography', 'history', 'comedy', 'war', 'film', 'heart', 'allegorical', 'sort', 'epitaph', 'wild', 'era', 'American', 'history', '1960s-70s', 'psychological', 'catharsis', 'Warning', 'review', 'spoilers', 'seem', 'be', 'told', 'everything', 'protagonist', 'singular', 'trait', 'little', 'bit', 'dumb', 'more', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'being', 'little', 'bit', 'dumb', 'also', ""'little"", 'bit', 'innocent', ""'little"", 'bit', 'hardworking', ""'little"", 'bit', 'selfless', ""'little"", 'bit', 'lucky', 'least', 'regards', 'personal', 'affairs', 'Ultimately', 'narrator', 'Forrest', 'fill', 'role', 'angelic', 'ideal', 'Dante', 'wandering', 'depths', 'Hell', 'Divine', 'Comedy', 'man', 'who', 'never', 'eaten', 'Tree', 'Knowledge', 'stumbling', 'depicted', 'darkness', 'postwar', 'America.T.S', 'Eliot', 'once', 'remarked', 'shall', 'not', 'cease', 'exploration', 'end', 'exploring', 'will', 'be', 'arrive', 'where', 'started', 'know', 'place', 'first', 'time', 'apply', 'aptly', 'here', 'time', 'return', 'bus', 'bench', 'Forrest', 'end', 'when', 'return', 'feather', 'see', 'same', 'things', 'yet', 'know', 'meaning', 'first', 'time', 'Jenny', 'female', 'charge', 'angelic', 'Dante', 'bird', 'flown', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'college', 'singing', 'career', 'antiwar', 'movement', 'waitressing', 'finally', 'AIDS', 'victim', 'arrived', 'back', 'where', 'started', 'wheat', 'field', 'father', 'home', 'alone', 'Forrest', 'side', 'only', 'know', 'simple', 'kind', 'love', 'first', 'time', 'interesting', 'plug', ""'Nice"", 'Guys', 'who', 'can', 'never', 'get', 'break', ""n't"", 'what', 'perhaps', 'film', 'Jenny', 'was', 'not', 'wrong', 'want', 'fly', 'even', 'directions', 'flight', 'were', 'not', 'fortuitous', 'should', 'not', 'refrain', 'exploring', 'life', 'ourselves', 'Forrest', 'certainly', 'never', 'did', 'even', 'was', 'inadvertent', 'journey', 'saintly', 'character', 'one', 'level', 'be', 'stunning', 'example', 'writer', 'indictment', 'contrast', 'American', 'culture', 'presumably', 'own', 'generation', 'morality', 'play', 'only', 'stories', 'Gump', 'earthly', 'charges', 'Bubba', 'Lt.', 'Dan', 'Jenny', 'are', 'tragic', 'ones', 'Forrest', 'not', 'God', 'hand', 'infinite', 'justice', 'were', 'reaching', 'down', 'placing', 'virtuous', 'Gump', 'most', 'opportune', 'positions', 'even', 'world', 'lost', 'Unfortunately', 'mortals', 'real', 'world', 'can', 'not', 'truly', 'live', 'up', 'model', 'movie', 'forth', 'Imperfect', 'living', 'world', 'where', 'guile', 'self-interest', 'pay', 'descended', 'fallen', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'are', 'more', 'Lt.', 'Dan', 'Jenny', 'Forrest.Yet', 'tragic', 'characters', 'herein', 'aside', 'important', 'remember', 'risks', 'inherent', 'life', 'moral', 'sacrifices', 'self-interest', 'sometimes', 'required', 'are', 'never', 'justification', 'turning', 'one', 'back', 'even', 'none', 'will', 'be', 'effortlessly', 'successful', 'Forrest', 'Let', 'not', 'take', 'message', 'despair', 'not', 'necessary', 'be', 'angelic', 'idiot', 'order', 'do', 'substantial', 'good', 'world', 'explorations', 'life', 'bring', 'back', 'place', 'where', 'started', 'complexity', 'chaos', 'confusion', 'become', 'brittle', 'melt', 'love', 'also', 'true', 'love', 'compels', 'live', 'life', 'nonetheless', 'pursue', 'dreams', 'fly', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'Even', 'only', 'so', 'perhaps', 'one', 'day', 'may', 'look', 'back', 'again', 'what', 'had', 'beginning', 'understanding', 'eyes', 'know', 'first', 'time', 'final', 'scene', 'film', 'young', 'Forrest', 'Jr.', 'boarding', 'school', 'bus', 'smartest', 'kid', 'class', 'thus', 'presumably', 'imperfect', 'mortal', 'mother', 'ready', 'face', 'life', 'new', 'adventures', 'Where', 'will', 'lead', 'None', 'would', 'deny', 'chance', 'find', 'out', 'So', 'film', 'inspired', 'thoughtful', 'catharsis', 'would', 'think', 'not', 'indictment', 'postwar', 'generation', 'reached', 'out', 'ambitiously', 'optimistically', 'culture', 'uniquely', 'American', 'place', 'wisdom', 'begin', 'again']",N/A

Like many a ""fair unknown"" of early novelists -- from the the romancers of the Middle Ages to Henry Fielding in the 18th century -- Forrest, the archetypal innocent brilliantly played by Tom Hanks, teaches us to see the world anew.And what we learn is both enchanting and disenchanting. The film romps through three decades of the late 20th century, revealing the foibles of those times but also some of their finest potential. Forrest's run back and forth across the country is hilarious. My favorite line: ""I'm pretty tired now. I think I'll go home.""The music is almost an independent character, which threads its way throughout the film, helping not only to capture the spirit of the times but also to remind us as only music can of the rhythmic synchronicity of human life. This is also a rhythm that the circular plot and the repeating image of the feather brings forward.Forrest's modesty makes space for my favorite character in the film: the magnificent Captain Dan (Gary Sinise), who Ahab-like dares God to bring on his worst -- and in the process proves both the resilience of the human spirit (and invites us to laugh at its pretensions). Sally Field (as Forrest's mama) and Robin Wright Penn (as Jenny) are also not bad.The naysayers who think their highbrow taste puts them above this film just do not understand what it's all about.

Seeing it again I was reminded why this is one of my all-time favorite pictures.THE PLOT: Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump, a mildly retarded Alabaman who brushes shoulders with the key figures and events of the 50s through the early 80s. Due to hard work, focus and uncommon wisdom he is hugely successful at whatever he does (running, war hero, ping pong, shrimp fishing). Meanwhile, the one woman he loves in all the world, Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), flounders through life hopelessly trying to find fulfillment in the drug culture with all the wrong people.""Forrest Gump"" is hugely entertaining on every level. It's a drama that skillfully includes both lighter, comedic moments and serious, tragic elements. If you've never seen it, don't think for a second that this is some average romantic comedy or goofball comedy. Far from it. I don't watch the Acadamy Awards or give any creedance to their judgment (""American Beauty,"" best picture? Please) but ""Forrest Gump"" is one instance where they were absolutely right in regard to the Best Picture award.Some have criticized the film as an imbecilic fantasy, arguing that a simpleton like Gump would never become successful. It's true that the picture exagerates Forrest's successes and experiences, and in that sense it's not realistic, but the film plainly reveals WHY he experienced continued success throughout his life. We can all learn from these little gems of wisdom:-- Whatever your I.Q., zero in on the areas for which you have a real talant.-- Focus on those gifts and master them. In other words, don't be a jack of all trades. This is in line with the Russian proverb: ""If you chase 8 rabbits you'll catch none.""-- Mastering your talants will take HARD WORK (which explains why lazy people are never wealthy, unless they inherit it).-- Whatever you do, do it WITH ALL YOUR HEART.-- Love deeply and cultivate deep loyalties (e.g. Jenny, Bubba & Lt. Dan). Loyalty is underrated.-- Be patient and slow to judge (unless someone abuses another person).-- Allow others the freedom to choose and make mistakes, even if it seems like it takes forever for them to learn from them.-- If something or someone STINKS, reject it and stay away from it (remember the prostitute?).-- Keep your word.-- Pray and have FAITH.-- Keep a humble spirit no matter how successful or great you become.We can also learn lessons from Jenny: Trying to attain fulfillment through loose sex and foreign substances is a LOST cause. Recognize and embrace those who have your best interests in mind (i.e. those who truly love you and are loyal to you); stay away from people who use and abuse you.From Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise) we learn a potent lesson about struggling with God to find true peace, success and reconciliation. Dan's all-out fight with God on the shrimp boat in the storm is potent and REAL. The great men and women of the bible experienced intense struggles with God: Most of the book of Job shows Job arguing with the Almighty and wanting to put Him on trial for crimes against humanity (!!); When God finally answers him Job falls to his face in humility and reverence. Jacob fought with God all night; the next day the Lord changed his name to Israel, which means ""struggles with God"" (Genesis 32:22-30). Also, remember Jesus' struggle with God and His will in the Garden of Gethsemane?Another thing we can learn from Lt. Dan is that he was able to recognize a ""golden connection"" in Forrest. No one makes it alone, no one. They had help. Despite Forrest's lack of academic smarts, Dan recognized his wisdom and greatness; it attracted him and he respected it. Because of his link to Gump he became hugely successful. Remember: ""One day of favor is worth a lifetime of labor.""Late in the film you'll see Lt. Dan and his Asian fiance at Gump's wedding. Note how Dan LOOKS at Forrest when they greet each other. Dan shows the utmost love and respect for Gump and is in utter awe of his simple-minded greatness. (This is great acting on Sinise's part).""Forrest Gump"" is a film gem to be RELISHED on many levels.

But his good heart and simple understanding of things helps him live a life we all envy.Why We like the StoryWe root for him because of his good heart and the way he treats people and love that he unwittingly becomes a college football star, medal of honor soilder in the Army, shrimping boat millionaire, Macintosh stock holder etc. Gump is present at so many historical events that it keeps our interest and the fact that Gump witnesses all these events and has no clue about the significance of these events makes it amusing and endearing.QuotesThere are so many great quotes from this movie ""Life is like a box of chocolates"" ""Stupid is as stupid does"" ""But Leitentent Dan, you ain't got no legs"" ""Sorry I ruined your Black Panther Party"" ""I gotta pee"" ..... etc. etc. they are endless.O yea and the classic ""RUN FORREST, RUN"".Tom Hanks's ActingThe amazing scene where Gump finds  out that he has a child, lil Forrest and he gasps  ""Is he...."" and can't say the word smart because he knows what life the kid will have if he is slow like his dad, how people will treat him and how lonely and inadequte the child would feel. Its an amazing scene and you feel the humanity of Forrest Gump.He is an amazing actor. His performance here makes slow forrest a human to us. We don't spend the movie seeing him as a sad retarded guy. We see him as a person, who has something to overcome. He is lovable but a real character. Forrest is not reduced to a typical ""retarded guy with not personality"". Many ""retarded"" people are depicted in movies as simple, who laugh at simple things and have no depth.

126684,AP3B615GM191G,0792140923,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","When it comes to the greatest dramatic films ever produced, &#34;Forrest Gump&#34; has to be near the top of that list.  Put succinctly, it has everything a movie could possible hold: adventure, great characters, drama, emotion, and humor.  There are very few films that combine all those things with such aplomb as director Robert Zemeckis does with &#34;Gump&#34;.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the life story of Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), a man who, on the &#34;scale of normal&#34;, falls a wee bit short in the intelligence department.  However, via the guidance of his beloved Mama (Sally Field), the constant wanting for childhood sweetheart-turned-wild child Jenny (Robin Wright), and friends like Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) and Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise), viewers are shown a life that, despite coming from such a simple man, has touched so many others.There are two primary reasons why &#34;Forrest Gump&#34; will resonate through the ages:First, is the Gump character himself.  Not only did it rocket Tom Hanks to super stardom, but it is one of the greatest representations of life ever put on the big screen.  Even though Forrest is obviously &#34;slow&#34;, he has qualities about him that we all wish we could mimic.  He doesn't get caught up in the &#34;b.s.&#34; of life, instead just taking things at face value and living life in the moment.  As a result, he has a knack for showing up at the right place at the right time.  Sometimes, we get so caught up in the minutiae of our everyday lives that we forget to just &#34;live&#34;...something Forrest does like no other.Secondly, this movie is a reflection of its times.  I think there are so many baby boomers who, like Jenny, thought that counter-culture (drugs, hippies, etc.) was the best route into adulthood.  What many of them realized, however, was that such behavior could not last forever, and eventually you have to come back to reality.  In this case, Jenny has a Forrest to come back to, which provides the primary drama of the film.Overall, &#34;Forrest Gump&#34; is a landmark effort in cinema, as it is one of the only movies that can still hold up perfectly despite being only about &#34;the journey&#34;, so to speak.  It can be watched by viewers of pretty much all ages and enjoyed on some level.  The film is on television so much these days that sometimes it gets a little over-exposed, but it still remains a special piece of filmmaking.",5,One Man's Journey,1390694400,"01 26, 2014",2014,2436,"['When', 'greatest', 'dramatic', 'films', 'ever', 'produced', '34', 'Forrest', 'Gump', '34', 'be', 'top', 'list', 'Put', 'succinctly', 'everything', 'movie', 'could', 'possible', 'hold', 'adventure', 'great', 'characters', 'drama', 'emotion', 'humor', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'combine', 'things', 'such', 'aplomb', 'director', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', '34', 'Gump', '34', '.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'movie', 'life', 'story', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'man', 'who', '34', 'scale', 'normal', '34', 'wee', 'bit', 'short', 'intelligence', 'department', 'However', 'guidance', 'beloved', 'Mama', 'Sally', 'Field', 'constant', 'wanting', 'childhood', 'sweetheart-turned-wild', 'child', 'Jenny', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'friends', 'Bubba', 'Mykelti', 'Williamson', 'Lt.', 'Dan', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'viewers', 'are', 'shown', 'life', 'coming', 'simple', 'man', 'touched', 'so', 'many', 'are', 'two', 'primary', 'reasons', 'why', '34', 'Forrest', 'Gump', '34', 'will', 'resonate', 'ages', 'First', 'Gump', 'character', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'rocket', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'super', 'stardom', 'one', 'greatest', 'representations', 'life', 'ever', 'put', 'big', 'screen', 'Even', 'Forrest', 'obviously', '34', 'slow', '34', 'qualities', 'wish', 'could', 'mimic', ""n't"", 'get', 'caught', 'up', '34', 'b.s.', '34', 'life', 'instead', 'just', 'taking', 'things', 'face', 'value', 'living', 'life', 'moment', 'result', 'knack', 'showing', 'up', 'right', 'place', 'right', 'time', 'Sometimes', 'get', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'minutiae', 'everyday', 'forget', 'just', '34', 'live', '34', 'something', 'Forrest', 'other.Secondly', 'movie', 'reflection', 'times', 'think', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'baby', 'boomers', 'who', 'Jenny', 'thought', 'counter-culture', 'drugs', 'hippies', 'etc', 'was', 'best', 'route', 'adulthood', 'What', 'many', 'realized', 'however', 'was', 'such', 'behavior', 'could', 'not', 'last', 'forever', 'eventually', 'have', 'come', 'back', 'reality', 'case', 'Jenny', 'Forrest', 'come', 'back', 'primary', 'drama', 'film.Overall', '34', 'Forrest', 'Gump', '34', 'landmark', 'effort', 'cinema', 'one', 'only', 'movies', 'can', 'still', 'hold', 'up', 'perfectly', 'being', 'only', '34', 'journey', '34', 'speak', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'viewers', 'pretty', 'much', 'ages', 'enjoyed', 'level', 'film', 'television', 'so', 'much', 'days', 'little', 'over-exposed', 'still', 'special', 'piece', 'filmmaking']",N/A

I highly recommend this movie because of all the great actors, the plot, etc. I look at it as a drama and to me, drama has a little bit of everything in it.",5,Forrest Gump (1994),1098144000,"10 19, 2004",2004,573,"['Forrest', 'Gump', 'what', 'there', 'say', 'Excellent', 'movie', 'seeing', 'history', 'telling', 'point', 'view', 'Many', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'era', 'do', 'not', 'realize', 'how', 'everything', 'was', 'see', 'movie', 'history', 'whole', 'love', 'plot', 'well', 'movie', 'movie', 'definitely', 'one', 'favorites', 'friends', 'can', 'remember', 'word', 'word', 'use', 'many', 'quotes', 'till', 'day', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'great', 'actors', 'plot', 'etc', 'look', 'drama', 'drama', 'little', 'bit', 'everything']",N/A

Mann,"[2, 4]","&quot;FORREST GUMP&quot;(One of my favorite movies) is an uplifting, heartwarming, and heartbreaking, experience, where you see the whole wide world through the eyes of a man who's never seen it before, and hardly understands it.Through my opinion, &quot;FORREST GUMP&quot; deserved every Oscar it won(Except for one). Tom Hanks(With his back-to-back Oscars) had been amazingly convincing(What, with his accent and all), but I found it nearly absurd that he was chosen over the even more amazingly convincing, Morgan Freeman, in &quot;THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION&quot;(Also one of my favorite movies). While watching this epic for the first time I laughed and cried, nearly at the same time. This movie is awe-inspiring, and though it is PG-13, I wouldn't reccomend this to a kid 10 or under.The special features on the DVD look interesting and I might buy it someday on DVD, but for now, I'm sticking with what I originally had, the VHS.",5,"All That, and a Box of Chocolates.",1023494400,"06 8, 2002",2002,935,"['quot', 'FORREST', 'GUMP', 'quot', 'One', 'favorite', 'movies', 'uplifting', 'heartwarming', 'heartbreaking', 'experience', 'where', 'see', 'whole', 'wide', 'world', 'eyes', 'man', 'who', 'never', 'seen', 'hardly', 'it.Through', 'opinion', 'quot', 'FORREST', 'GUMP', 'quot', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'won', 'one', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'back-to-back', 'Oscars', 'had', 'been', 'amazingly', 'convincing', 'What', 'accent', 'found', 'nearly', 'absurd', 'was', 'chosen', 'even', 'more', 'amazingly', 'convincing', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'quot', 'THE', 'SHAWSHANK', 'REDEMPTION', 'quot', 'Also', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'watching', 'epic', 'first', 'time', 'laughed', 'cried', 'nearly', 'same', 'time', 'movie', 'awe-inspiring', 'PG-13', 'would', ""n't"", 'reccomend', 'kid', '10', 'under.The', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'look', 'interesting', 'might', 'buy', 'someday', 'DVD', 'now', ""'m"", 'sticking', 'what', 'originally', 'had', 'VHS']",N/A
