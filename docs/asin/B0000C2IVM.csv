Those take up about 40 minutes in each workout. The last 10 minutes are floor exercises, which I cannot do because of my excess weight and my arthritis. But the sitting and standing exercises are easy and fun. They are well worth the purchase of the dvd. And I plan to lose some weight, so maybe I can do the floor exercises in the future.

773168,A25KRCDHNK67JC,B0000C2IVM,Cat,"[39, 39]","I am not a senior but very inflexible and a yoga novice so I decided to start with this DVD.  Lilias is a joy to watch.  There is a morning session (more energizing) and an evening session (aimed more toward destressing and relaxing).  I think almost anyone would be able to do these stretches and easy yoga moves.Lilias does tend to talk a lot when explaining the moves, which is very helpful when you are just learning them but not once you are familiar with the DVD and waiting for her to move on.  What would be great is if this DVD had two versions of the session on it - one which went slow with a lot of explanation and another version which just flowed from move to move.Despite that, I would still highly recommend this DVD.  It will familiarize you with yoga and, when you are ready, you can always move on to a more challenging one.  As for me, I enjoy Lilias' calming and happy personality so much that I have stayed with this one for now.",5,Get started with Lilias,1223596800,"10 10, 2008",2008,951,"['am', 'not', 'senior', 'very', 'inflexible', 'yoga', 'novice', 'so', 'decided', 'start', 'DVD', 'Lilias', 'joy', 'watch', 'morning', 'session', 'more', 'energizing', 'evening', 'session', 'aimed', 'more', 'destressing', 'relaxing', 'think', 'almost', 'anyone', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'stretches', 'easy', 'yoga', 'moves.Lilias', 'tend', 'talk', 'lot', 'when', 'explaining', 'moves', 'very', 'helpful', 'when', 'are', 'just', 'learning', 'not', 'are', 'familiar', 'DVD', 'waiting', 'move', 'What', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'DVD', 'had', 'two', 'versions', 'session', 'one', 'went', 'slow', 'lot', 'explanation', 'version', 'just', 'flowed', 'move', 'move.Despite', 'would', 'still', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'will', 'familiarize', 'yoga', 'when', 'are', 'ready', 'can', 'always', 'move', 'more', 'challenging', 'one', 'enjoy', 'Lilias', 'calming', 'happy', 'personality', 'so', 'much', 'have', 'stayed', 'one', 'now']",Lilias!

This is a good one for seniors, people with limited movement, or boomers like me who may be feeling a little lazy at times but still in need of a nice stretch session.

She does a fine job explaining and demonstrating the positions. The workout is a little too advanced for myself at this point in time but I can do a lot of the positions just the same. I should think for most seniors this would be easy from the start.  The quality of the tape is lacking in sound at times but overall I would recommend this tape.
