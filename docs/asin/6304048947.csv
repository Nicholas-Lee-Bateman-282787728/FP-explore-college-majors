398289,A1MRKBLQ36BSN8,6304048947,Amazon Customer,"[10, 18]","I got this film by default as it was coupled with the ""Legend of 1900"" in a 2-DVD pack. I thought goodie ... I really like Tim Roth and in ""1900"" he is sparkiling, brilliant and ultimately very moving.The opening music of ""Bodies..."" is about the best thing about the movie, and it keeps coming back throughout the film, which is a plus (stops you chucking things at the TV out of frustration anyway).The rest of the movie is a complete pile of pants. The characters are universally unlikeable. Roth seems to try his best with the rubbish script but fails as he has least likeable character of the bunch. You come away not knowing or caring about any of them. Absolutley nothing happens in the movie (unless you count a totally gratuitous 'get your kit off' sex scene which isn't even well acted).I have seen some lame films in my time but this really takes the cake. The characters were stoned though most of the film, and I can only assume some of the positive reviewers followed their example whilst watching.The amazing thing is it comes with a full length commentary and various other odds and ends. I started to watch the featurette, but the first 2 minutes were so self serving and pretentious I couldn't watch it. There is no way anyone could provide an interesting commentary!If I could give less than one star I would, as it is all I could do was put the DVD in the bin. I retained the DVD case though, it was worth more.Interestingly the double DVD set is considerably cheaper than ""Legend of 1900"" on its own. I'd guess that's because anyone who is prepared to sit through this rubbish deserves a break on the other title.My advice - buy ""Legend of 1900"" at full price and save yourself the grief!",1,What are the other reviewers on?,1114214400,"04 23, 2005",2005,1709,"['got', 'film', 'default', 'was', 'coupled', 'Legend', '1900', '2-DVD', 'pack', 'thought', 'goodie', 'really', 'Tim', 'Roth', '1900', 'sparkiling', 'brilliant', 'ultimately', 'very', 'moving.The', 'opening', 'music', 'Bodies', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'coming', 'back', 'film', 'plus', 'stops', 'chucking', 'things', 'TV', 'frustration', 'anyway', '.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'complete', 'pile', 'pants', 'characters', 'are', 'universally', 'unlikeable', 'Roth', 'try', 'best', 'rubbish', 'script', 'least', 'likeable', 'character', 'bunch', 'come', 'away', 'not', 'knowing', 'caring', 'Absolutley', 'nothing', 'movie', 'count', 'totally', 'gratuitous', ""'get"", 'kit', 'off', 'sex', 'scene', ""n't"", 'even', 'well', 'acted', '.I', 'have', 'seen', 'lame', 'films', 'time', 'really', 'cake', 'characters', 'were', 'stoned', 'most', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'positive', 'reviewers', 'followed', 'example', 'watching.The', 'amazing', 'thing', 'full', 'length', 'commentary', 'various', 'other', 'odds', 'ends', 'started', 'watch', 'featurette', 'first', '2', 'minutes', 'were', 'so', 'self', 'serving', 'pretentious', 'could', ""n't"", 'watch', 'way', 'anyone', 'could', 'provide', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'could', 'give', 'less', 'one', 'star', 'would', 'could', 'do', 'was', 'put', 'DVD', 'bin', 'retained', 'DVD', 'case', 'was', 'worth', 'more.Interestingly', 'double', 'DVD', 'set', 'considerably', 'cheaper', 'Legend', '1900', 'own', ""'d"", 'guess', 'anyone', 'who', 'prepared', 'sit', 'rubbish', 'break', 'other', 'title.My', 'advice', 'buy', 'Legend', '1900', 'full', 'price', 'save', 'grief']","Bodies, Rest & Motion VHS"

""The Legend of 1900"" is a lovely, memorable movie; someone called it a ""fable for adults"" and it does have elements of fable/fantasy about it, but it is very beautifully done. This film made me go looking for more work from Tim Roth as I was not familiar with him and thought he was mesmerizing in this movie. It is puzzling that this film didn't seem to have gotten as much attention as it should have, but I'm telling everyone about it now - long after its original release! The music is also wonderful - soaring and lush, jazzy, ragtime and foxtrot, walz and beautiful orchestration.  Love the CD soundtrack, too!  The song at the end sung by Rogers Waters is just so lovely and moving; Roger Waters of Pink Floyd wrote the lyrics and sings the only vocal piece in the film, at the very end. Wonderful.

This is a totally unique plot of a baby named &#34;1900&#34; who grows into a successful man entirely within the confines of an ocean liner. Successful how? He's a gifted pianist, who can compete with the best jazz pianists in the world such as Jelly Roll Morton, with whom 1900 has a piano duel! Quirky. Funny. Poignant. Heartbreaking. Uplifting. But the MUSIC! There is some amazing piano work of this gorgeous score by Ennio Morricone (Cinema Paradisio). The romantic ballad 1900 plays toward the later part of the film tugs at the heart strings. Musical scenes are hugely entertaining. The duel, of course, is great fun, but when 1900 plays the grand piano during an ocean storm as he, on wheels, &#34;dances&#34; around the ballroom floor is musically exhilarating and hysterical.
