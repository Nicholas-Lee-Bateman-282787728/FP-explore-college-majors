Secondly, the songs are very catchy. At first, I admit that I didn't like some of the songs, but they grew on me. My daughter loves all of them. I think that ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" would have been awesome with a fast beat, but it's cute as a lullaby.",4,Great Graphics and Catchy Tunes,1331683200,"03 14, 2012",2012,374,"['First', 'foremost', 'graphics', 'are', 'beautiful', 'think', 'part', 'reason', 'daughter', 'DVD', 'so', 'much', 'Secondly', 'songs', 'are', 'very', 'catchy', 'first', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'songs', 'grew', 'daughter', 'think', 'Twinkle', 'Twinkle', 'Little', 'Star', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'awesome', 'fast', 'beat', 'cute', 'lullaby']",N/A

All 3 love the video. The toddler dances with the music of the snappier tunes and tries to sing along. She loves the ""Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star"" song at the end, especially where the star kisses the Kooky bird. This is the last song and is an excellent ending because it is quiet and peaceful.The twins watch the screen raptly. The boy coos and chatters along with the music, while the girl never takes her eyes off of the screen.This was the best $15 I have ever spent.

I eventually bought Vol.1 so she could watch/hear all the songs in full versions...and after a few days, she let me know just how much she appreciated it. At 3 months and 1 day, her first full sentence was &#34;I love you!&#34; ..repeated 6 or 7 times loudly while we played Peanut for her. She really seems to like Peanut and Kooky Bird. Up til then...she would coo/gurgle &#34;loveyou&#34;, not always distinctly--so it seems she was motivated by her joy with Peanut to tell us the phrase that she's heard us say to her so often.
