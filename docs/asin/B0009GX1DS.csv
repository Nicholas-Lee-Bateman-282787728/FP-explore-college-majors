I must admit, he was my idol back then. To this day, I'm still in awe of all the things he did. While I liked the movie(and think you will to), which stars George Eads(of CSI)playing the title role, I was expecting more about his life. To me, it seemed more like a remake of the 70's ""Evel Knievel"" film which starred George Hamilton. Not that it's a bad thing as that movie was pretty good. It's just I expected more about his life and his family than just the highlights of his career.However,John Badham (of Saturday Night Fever fame) did an outstanding job directing this movie. George Eads played a convincing Evel, as well.All in all, though, the movie is pretty good. Inspiring, to say the least. I really liked it and I think you will, too.",5,Evel Knievel......,1123027200,"08 3, 2005",2005,866,"['had', 'priviledge', 'growing', 'up', 'time', 'Evel', 'Knievel', 'soared', 'high', 'many', 'death-defying', 'jumps', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'idol', 'back', 'then', 'day', ""'m"", 'still', 'awe', 'things', 'did', 'liked', 'movie', 'think', 'will', 'George', 'Eads', 'CSI', 'playing', 'title', 'role', 'was', 'expecting', 'more', 'life', 'seemed', 'more', 'remake', '70', 'Evel', 'Knievel', 'film', 'starred', 'George', 'Hamilton', 'Not', 'bad', 'thing', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'just', 'expected', 'more', 'life', 'family', 'just', 'highlights', 'career.However', 'John', 'Badham', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'fame', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'directing', 'movie', 'George', 'Eads', 'played', 'convincing', 'Evel', 'well.All', 'though', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'Inspiring', 'say', 'least', 'really', 'liked', 'think', 'will', 'too']",N/A

While I thought George Eads was a good choice I didn't think so after watching it. The book by Steve Mandich was great and very accurate but the movie suffers from a poor script .
