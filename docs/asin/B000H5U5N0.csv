1009715,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000H5U5N0,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[22, 23]","This is definitely a different approach to working out your core.  Over time, yoga instructor Shiva Rea's media releases have become more and more fluid and freeform, and Creative Core Abs is no exception.  The Main Menu of this DVD offers the following options:  Introduction-Play Workout-Chapter Index-Shiva Rea Biography-Music Options-Also from Acacia.The Amazon.com editorial review did a very good job of breaking down the three practices available on this DVD.  The first, Water Core, is 10 minutes long.  All of the sequences here are performed on the floor, mostly on the knees or on the back, for the effect of a sort of flowing warm-up.  I found the music here very reminiscent of Ali McGraw's Yoga Mind & Body.  The next segment, Spontaneous Core, is the shortest at 8 minutes; this time there's a live drummer.  Shiva incorporates some of the movements from the Water Core, adds some crunch-like work, and then encourages you to put them all together in your own pattern.  Shiva ends with some stretches, including cobra pose.  The drummer continues into the final segment, Fire Core, a more lengthy practice (17 minutes).  Here Shiva starts with kapalabhati breathing (she also calls this ""Breath of Fire,"" but my understanding is that kapalabhati and breath of fire are two distinct types of yogic breathing).  This segment is definitely the most intense, as it incorporates quite a bit of plank work, including what Shiva calls an ""advanced agni kriya,"" or a sort of rapid plank with hopping each knee in and out; elbow plank appears as well.  This segment is the only one which includes some standing work, as Shiva performs squats, a fun take on Warrior 2 (adding a bow and arrow arm movement), and wide-legged standing forward bend.As mentioned above, this is definitely an innovative approach to core work.  However, I found the actual effect on my core to be somewhat hit or miss:  sometimes I felt that I was strongly targeting my core, but at other times, it was so difficult to follow what Shiva was doing that I didn't feel I was getting much of a workout at all.  While some will surely find Shiva's unique approach refreshing, many are likely to find it just plain weird.  Although I do like Shiva, I find myself closer to the latter camp.  I don't mind non-traditional approaches to core work, but overall, this DVD was just not a good fit for me.",3,Innovative core-focused yoga practice,1204416000,"03 2, 2008",2008,2374,"['definitely', 'different', 'approach', 'working', 'out', 'core', 'time', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'media', 'releases', 'have', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'fluid', 'freeform', 'Creative', 'Core', 'Abs', 'exception', 'Main', 'Menu', 'DVD', 'following', 'options', 'Introduction-Play', 'Workout-Chapter', 'Index-Shiva', 'Rea', 'Biography-Music', 'Options-Also', 'Acacia.The', 'Amazon.com', 'editorial', 'review', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'breaking', 'down', 'three', 'practices', 'available', 'DVD', 'first', 'Water', 'Core', '10', 'minutes', 'long', 'sequences', 'here', 'are', 'performed', 'floor', 'mostly', 'knees', 'back', 'effect', 'sort', 'flowing', 'warm-up', 'found', 'music', 'here', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Ali', 'McGraw', 'Yoga', 'Mind', 'Body', 'next', 'segment', 'Spontaneous', 'Core', 'shortest', '8', 'minutes', 'time', 'live', 'drummer', 'Shiva', 'movements', 'Water', 'Core', 'crunch-like', 'work', 'then', 'put', 'together', 'own', 'pattern', 'Shiva', 'stretches', 'including', 'cobra', 'pose', 'drummer', 'final', 'segment', 'Fire', 'Core', 'more', 'lengthy', 'practice', '17', 'minutes', 'Here', 'Shiva', 'kapalabhati', 'breathing', 'also', 'Breath', 'Fire', 'understanding', 'kapalabhati', 'breath', 'fire', 'are', 'two', 'distinct', 'types', 'yogic', 'breathing', 'segment', 'definitely', 'most', 'intense', 'quite', 'bit', 'plank', 'work', 'including', 'what', 'Shiva', 'advanced', 'agni', 'kriya', 'sort', 'rapid', 'plank', 'hopping', 'knee', 'plank', 'as', 'well', 'segment', 'only', 'one', 'standing', 'work', 'Shiva', 'performs', 'squats', 'fun', 'take', 'Warrior', '2', 'adding', 'bow', 'arrow', 'arm', 'movement', 'wide-legged', 'standing', 'forward', 'bend.As', 'mentioned', 'definitely', 'innovative', 'approach', 'core', 'work', 'However', 'found', 'actual', 'effect', 'core', 'be', 'somewhat', 'hit', 'miss', 'sometimes', 'felt', 'was', 'strongly', 'targeting', 'core', 'other', 'times', 'was', 'so', 'difficult', 'follow', 'what', 'Shiva', 'was', 'doing', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'getting', 'much', 'workout', 'will', 'surely', 'find', 'Shiva', 'unique', 'approach', 'refreshing', 'many', 'are', 'likely', 'find', 'just', 'plain', 'weird', 'do', 'Shiva', 'find', 'closer', 'latter', 'camp', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'non-traditional', 'approaches', 'core', 'work', 'overall', 'DVD', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'good', 'fit']",Shiva Rea - Creative Core Abs

I can now say I am among those fortunate enough to have met this incredible lady and I know from first hand experience that she would never give herself such a self-lauding name, instead, she uses names such as ""River Guide"" and ""The small teacher"" (in comparison to the big teacher that is within most of us Yogis)to describe herself.Ok, I have that off my chest, now I will say that this DVD is shorter than the rest of her creations but brings every ounce of inspiration and a new look at the practice of Yoga that her other DVD's have.  Also, as another reviewer mentioned, this is great on those days when you have less time or your body needs a workout that is less intense.  None of these sequences feel like you are doing ""ab work"", instead, it seems to me almost like dancing. Of course the music is also phenomenal, this gift of hers for choosing the perfect music for a sequence is no accident--this lady really lives for music!

This DVD provides a very unique way to work your abdominals.  It does not employ a lot of static crunches and situp type ab work that I am use to, instead you will utilize various body parts to work your abs.  A lot of the work you will do is very much based on the rhythm of the music that is playing in the background.  I would say that parts of workout are more like Shiva's trance dance type stuff, where there is room to find your own beat and style of performing a set of movements.  If you are use to yoga that has you sit in a position and then move to another (e.g. Iyengar) or even if you more used to constant movement (e.g. Vinyasa Flow, Ashtanga), you may still find this different.  In my opinion, it is  very fluid and more dance like than Shiva's very successful Yoga Shakti DVD. And depending upon what you want out of your yoga practice that could be either good or bad.

1009723,A2AC3VJPUZS42C,B000H5U5N0,Jenny G,"[2, 3]","I have done the Water Core and Spontaneous Core sequences several times now, either together, or for the Spontaneous Core following a Core Fusion routine (it's a bonus segment on their newer Arms & Abs DVD).  Neither of the routines are particularly challenging for me, but I like that they offer something different than the ab routines I normally do.  I think it is important to work muscles in a variety of ways, so it's a nice alternative from my regular routine, or perhaps on days where I'm looking for something more gentle.  These routines tend to hit me more in the waist and obliques.I did the Fire Core sequence for the first time today. I do planks and push ups as part of my normal routine and so this wasn't difficult for me.  But as my hip was a little sore today, I found that this was a nice option. With the flowing movements towards the end and twisting rotations it really loosened me up.I did make a modification to the exercise where she is is on her knees and bending her body back.  That is too much strain on my knees so I did these as a seated exercise, similar to how she does later in the Water Core sequence.All in all, I don't think this will be something I use as a set rotation in my schedule because it isn't challenging enough, but it will be great on days that I'm looking for a little variety.",5,Nice for something different,1269043200,"03 20, 2010",2010,1329,"['have', 'done', 'Water', 'Core', 'Spontaneous', 'Core', 'several', 'times', 'now', 'together', 'Spontaneous', 'Core', 'following', 'Core', 'Fusion', 'routine', 'bonus', 'segment', 'newer', 'Arms', 'Abs', 'DVD', 'routines', 'are', 'particularly', 'challenging', 'like', 'offer', 'something', 'different', 'ab', 'routines', 'normally', 'do', 'think', 'important', 'work', 'muscles', 'variety', 'ways', 'nice', 'alternative', 'regular', 'routine', 'perhaps', 'days', 'where', ""'m"", 'looking', 'something', 'more', 'gentle', 'routines', 'tend', 'hit', 'more', 'waist', 'obliques.I', 'did', 'Fire', 'Core', 'sequence', 'first', 'time', 'today', 'do', 'planks', 'push', 'ups', 'part', 'normal', 'routine', 'so', 'was', ""n't"", 'difficult', 'hip', 'was', 'little', 'sore', 'today', 'found', 'was', 'nice', 'option', 'flowing', 'movements', 'end', 'twisting', 'rotations', 'really', 'loosened', 'up.I', 'did', 'make', 'modification', 'exercise', 'where', 'knees', 'bending', 'body', 'back', 'too', 'much', 'strain', 'knees', 'so', 'did', 'seated', 'exercise', 'similar', 'how', 'later', 'Water', 'Core', 'sequence.All', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'be', 'something', 'use', 'set', 'rotation', 'schedule', ""n't"", 'challenging', 'enough', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'days', ""'m"", 'looking', 'little', 'variety']",Shiva Rea - Creative Core Abs

So here is the review.Takes place in White Sands National Monument with a drummer on a rock and cool music. There is also a 'just music' option that is nice for just moving to or doing one's own yoga moves.There are three workouts that can be done on their own or all rolled together. Done together it's a real nice burn for the torso/core in 35 minutes.In separate sections here are the parts -Water Core (10 min) - the 'easy' part. A good warm-up but still an excellent core burn. Creative, fun.Spontaneous Core (8 min) - very tiring - this is really the hardest part, as there is no rest once you get both your head and the hips/legs in the air. The free form part is cool if you like Shiva's style.Fire Core (17 mins) - Shiva moves fast in this, as she does in this whole DVD. You pretty much have to accept that it's okay to not be able to follow along at first, and not having a ton of structure until you've seen this a few times. This particular section is harder than part one and easier than part two.I was some reviews on Amazon on this DVD and a lot of people find the last part, the Fire Core, the hardest. The Fire Core has a lot of regular planks, followed by one-legged planks and then this section where you kind of ""run in place"" while doing planks. Hard to describe but pretty nifty: I felt strong doing that. There are also some flowy warrior poses where you 'draw an arrow on a bow' - also pretty neat - and then whip your arms around while holding warrior 2. Made me feel like Artemis. :)There is no Savasana in this DVD. I thought that was a bit odd, but I guess this is to be a short, contained core workout and not strictly yoga? Besides a few planks and cobras there are few typical, recognizable poses.This DVD is experienced beginner to intermediate and I DO NOT think any yoga novice should expect to be able to follow along very closely. Shiva moves quite fast and does not explain what she's doing as she goes.This is not a boring ab routine. What's best, in my view, is the 'creative' part. There are no crunches, just some really interesting freeform-yet-intense pulsing moves.Definitely gets your sheen going! I did feel a fire in my belly afterwards, chilling out on the couch with the TV. The inner heat lasted about 20 minutes.Well recommended for a quick, slightly intense core experience that Shiva  stamps with her typically enjoyable creative mark.",5,"Interesting, kinda yoga, kinda dance-like, builds a nice core warmth",1213574400,"06 16, 2008",2008,2492,"['ordered', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'Creative', 'Core', 'Abs', 'DVD', 'library', 'interloan', 'system', 'came', 'today', 'Yay', 'So', 'here', 'review.Takes', 'place', 'White', 'Sands', 'National', 'Monument', 'drummer', 'rock', 'cool', 'music', 'also', ""'just"", 'music', 'option', 'nice', 'just', 'moving', 'doing', 'one', 'own', 'yoga', 'are', 'three', 'workouts', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'own', 'rolled', 'together', 'Done', 'together', 'real', 'nice', 'burn', 'torso/core', '35', 'minutes.In', 'separate', 'sections', 'here', 'are', 'parts', '-Water', 'Core', '10', 'min', ""'easy"", 'part', 'good', 'warm-up', 'still', 'excellent', 'core', 'burn', 'Creative', 'fun.Spontaneous', 'Core', '8', 'min', 'very', 'tiring', 'really', 'hardest', 'part', 'rest', 'once', 'get', 'head', 'hips/legs', 'air', 'free', 'form', 'part', 'cool', 'like', 'Shiva', 'style.Fire', 'Core', '17', 'mins', 'Shiva', 'moves', 'fast', 'whole', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'much', 'have', 'accept', 'okay', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'follow', 'along', 'first', 'not', 'having', 'ton', 'structure', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'times', 'particular', 'section', 'harder', 'part', 'one', 'easier', 'part', 'two.I', 'was', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'DVD', 'lot', 'people', 'find', 'last', 'part', 'Fire', 'Core', 'hardest', 'Fire', 'Core', 'lot', 'regular', 'planks', 'followed', 'one-legged', 'planks', 'then', 'section', 'where', 'kind', 'run', 'place', 'doing', 'planks', 'Hard', 'describe', 'pretty', 'nifty', 'felt', 'strong', 'doing', 'are', 'also', 'flowy', 'warrior', 'poses', 'where', ""'draw"", 'arrow', 'bow', 'also', 'pretty', 'neat', 'then', 'whip', 'arms', 'holding', 'warrior', '2', 'Made', 'feel', 'Artemis', 'Savasana', 'DVD', 'thought', 'was', 'bit', 'odd', 'guess', 'be', 'short', 'contained', 'core', 'workout', 'not', 'strictly', 'yoga', 'few', 'planks', 'cobras', 'are', 'few', 'typical', 'recognizable', 'poses.This', 'DVD', 'experienced', 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'DO', 'NOT', 'think', 'yoga', 'novice', 'should', 'expect', 'be', 'able', 'follow', 'along', 'very', 'closely', 'Shiva', 'quite', 'fast', 'not', 'explain', 'what', 'doing', 'not', 'boring', 'ab', 'routine', 'What', 'best', 'view', ""'creative"", 'part', 'are', 'crunches', 'just', 'really', 'interesting', 'freeform-yet-intense', 'pulsing', 'moves.Definitely', 'sheen', 'going', 'did', 'feel', 'fire', 'belly', 'afterwards', 'chilling', 'out', 'couch', 'TV', 'inner', 'heat', 'lasted', '20', 'minutes.Well', 'recommended', 'quick', 'slightly', 'intense', 'core', 'experience', 'Shiva', 'typically', 'enjoyable', 'creative', 'mark']",Shiva Rea - Creative Core Abs
