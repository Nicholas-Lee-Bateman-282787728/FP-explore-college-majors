If this was from the 1970's I would have accepted that this was the technology of the day, but 2011? C'mon! And the stage colors are dark and dull. Not much color at all. I've seen several concerts recorded in Japan and they look amazing. I'm sure they have better equipment for rent than this crap.The audio quality is a step up, but still muddy, bass heavy and too much keyboards. The drums lack any power at all. The guitar is totally missing except for solos.Fortunately the songs and the performance are top notch. But they do look like they are phoning it in.Wish I could rate it higher!",2,"Video and Audio Are Poor, Performance Good",1388016000,"12 26, 2013",2013,671,"['Jeez', 'huge', 'fan', 'UK', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'video', 'quality', 'SUCKS', 'was', '1970', 'would', 'have', 'accepted', 'was', 'technology', 'day', '2011', ""C'mon"", 'stage', 'colors', 'are', 'dark', 'dull', 'Not', 'much', 'color', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'several', 'concerts', 'recorded', 'Japan', 'look', 'amazing', ""'m"", 'sure', 'have', 'better', 'equipment', 'rent', 'crap.The', 'audio', 'quality', 'step', 'up', 'still', 'muddy', 'bass', 'heavy', 'too', 'much', 'keyboards', 'drums', 'lack', 'power', 'guitar', 'totally', 'missing', 'solos.Fortunately', 'songs', 'performance', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'do', 'look', 'are', 'phoning', 'in.Wish', 'could', 'rate', 'higher']",UK: Reunion - Live In Tokyo

The sound and video quality are fine.

1612960,AWWN9XK9AHTG5,B00AKZ8DPY,Ignaciocue,"[4, 4]","The path to the inmortal musical stature of Jobson and Wetton included these bands: Curved Air, Zappa, Roxy Music,Family, King Crimson, Wishbone Ash, Uriah Heep, Asia and more.For anyone that has followed this giants'carrer, this DVD is great! except for the sound,  which is indeed not at the level us fans expect. Sounds like a great bootleg, no more.I even did not miss Tery Bozzio, even though he is one of my top ten drummers ever. I was really, really pissed off to know that Bozzio was not in, but in a few seconds this Marco Minneman straightened me out.  He plays with incredible taste and accuracy. In fact , he is kind of the star here, visually and soundwise. And about the guitarist? holy s***! Jobson hired nothing but the best for this gig.Now, the most important thing: The music...  great as ever. The quality of these songs makes them prog classics. Jobson's keyboard and violin work is outstanding in this DVD.  And wetton still has that great voice and masterbuilt bass lines.",4,Living legends of prog .

I saw some unfavorable reviews here on Amazon but I dissagree with them. I saw the band in NYC the night before they left for Japan and seeing this film of them brought back a lot of great memories of that awesome show I got to see live in a very intimate setting.,4,Very good concert DVD,1365033600,"04 4, 2013",2013,353,"['am', 'very', 'happy', 'concert', 'DVD', 'would', 'recomend', 'UK', 'John', 'Wetton', 'fans', 'saw', 'unfavorable', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'dissagree', 'saw', 'band', 'NYC', 'night', 'left', 'Japan', 'seeing', 'film', 'brought', 'back', 'lot', 'great', 'memories', 'awesome', 'show', 'got', 'see', 'live', 'very', 'intimate', 'setting']",UK: Reunion - Live In Tokyo

Saw them live when they opened for Jethro Tull on October 31, 1979 in the Mid-South Coliseum, Memphis TN.I stumbled across this DVD a couple of weeks ago and bought it immediately.  Yes, the video and audio quality is not that great.  BUT, I still am very happy to have it in my collection.
