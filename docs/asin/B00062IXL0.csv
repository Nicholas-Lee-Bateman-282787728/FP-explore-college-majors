857102,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B00062IXL0,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[8, 10]","In some parts of Nevada, prostitution is legal.  It's the only U.S. state I know of where this is the case.  The most famous brothels in NV are the BUNNY Ranch & the MUSTANG Ranch, and both of these are mentioned-in-passing in this film.  The DIAMOND Ranch is a fictional ranch where the story in this film takes place.The framework of the story is set in the day-to-day operations of the ranch, while the plot of the film details how courtesans attempt to cope with ""real life"" outside the ranch.  Try as they might, they find it very difficult to live ""normal"" lives due to their chosen profession.One of the prostitutes is planning to get married.  Another prostitute wants to be a fit & supportive mother to her daughter while smoothing out relations w/her ex hubby.  One of the women wants to have a run-of-the-mill b/f while another of the girls is trying to escape from her controlling psycho pimp.What they all encounter is the fact that the occupation is kind of like a Venus flytrap;  once you get into it, it's next to impossible to escape the prostitution line-of-work.  Like exotic dancers, they find that nothing on the ""outside"" pays nearly as well, and the women only need to use their beauty to draw in $$.  On the downside, there is little hope of escape and they are continually looked down on by regular folk.For those wondering about the skin-o-meter, the DVD delivers in that regard.  All of the women on the cover except one appear topless @ least once.  Fortunately, they didn't try to make this into a watered-down ""G"" Rated affair.This is a pretty good flick which goes ""behind the curtain"" to show us what happens in a NV brothel.  I would particularly recommend this movie to any women who are even remotely considering getting into exotic dancing or working @ a brothel.

857103,AY12DBB0U420B,B00062IXL0,Gary Peterson,"[14, 16]","My wife and I purchased three ""Adult"" DVDs for late night viewing. The first was ""Forbidden"" and it was neither a very good movie, nor was it particularly arousing. A waste of time would be a good short description.The next night we viewed ""The Ranch,"" a story of a Nevada bordello. Now, just in case you haven't heard, prostitution is legal in all but two counties in Nevada. Once you get used to recognizing the establishments you'll find them scattered all over Nevada and many of them are referred to as ""ranches."" Some are way out in the country and some are in the smaller towns. About 50 years ago when I was a graduate student I visited ""The Big Four"" in Ely, Nevada. It was located about one block off the main street and looked like a low-key tavern. Two of us were taken there by a friend who just had to show us what a real bordello was like. We didn't partake, rather we just sat at the bar and drank a beer, much like one of the characters in the movie. Three young ladies came out and tried to entice us. I was a bit taken back in that the three women weren't glamorized at all as you usually see in Hollywood depictions. If you saw them out on the street, you would never recognize their profession. Never. Well, although somewhat tempting, at that time the going rate was said to be about twenty bucks. That might seem terribly cheap, but when you're working your way through school at at six bits an hour, it's  a week's wages and is very expensive. The establishment was neat and clean and nothing like what must go through most people's minds when they think of a bordello. While I was there a policeman came in, and he checked my ID to make certain I was old enough to drink.So that little experience helped me to understand and appreciate the movie ""The Ranch."" The movie involved the lives of a half-dozen prostitutes, all very real people with very real lives. The acting was excellent and the people were believable. All of the women appeared at least partially nude in one place or another, but it was done in a rather tasteful fashion. There were only a few actual sex scenes and they were rather low key. From my own experience, I'd say the bordello was rather large and glamorized and the woman were closer to the Hollywood versions of prostitutes and their surroundings. But, alas, my experience is limited to one visit of one bordello and that was 50 years ago. Who knows what they might be like today?In any case, ""The Ranch"" is a rather good movie. It's touching in places and funny in others. I wouldn't give it five stars, but I have no trouble at all with four. If you're just seeking arousal, there's better stuff around. But, if you're looking for a well done, interesting adult movie, I'd highly recommend ""The Ranch.""Gary Peterson",4,Well Done Adult Movie.,1283904000,"09 8, 2010",2010,2770,"['wife', 'purchased', 'three', 'Adult', 'DVDs', 'late', 'night', 'viewing', 'first', 'was', 'Forbidden', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'particularly', 'arousing', 'waste', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'short', 'description.The', 'next', 'night', 'viewed', 'Ranch', 'story', 'Nevada', 'bordello', 'Now', 'just', 'case', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'prostitution', 'legal', 'two', 'counties', 'Nevada', 'Once', 'get', 'used', 'recognizing', 'establishments', ""'ll"", 'find', 'scattered', 'Nevada', 'many', 'are', 'referred', 'ranches', 'are', 'way', 'country', 'are', 'smaller', 'towns', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'graduate', 'student', 'visited', 'Big', 'Four', 'Ely', 'Nevada', 'was', 'located', 'one', 'block', 'main', 'street', 'looked', 'low-key', 'tavern', 'Two', 'were', 'taken', 'there', 'friend', 'who', 'just', 'had', 'show', 'what', 'real', 'bordello', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'partake', 'rather', 'just', 'sat', 'bar', 'drank', 'beer', 'much', 'one', 'characters', 'movie', 'Three', 'young', 'ladies', 'came', 'out', 'tried', 'entice', 'was', 'bit', 'taken', 'back', 'three', 'women', 'were', ""n't"", 'glamorized', 'usually', 'see', 'Hollywood', 'depictions', 'saw', 'out', 'street', 'would', 'never', 'recognize', 'profession', 'Never', 'Well', 'somewhat', 'tempting', 'time', 'going', 'rate', 'was', 'said', 'be', 'twenty', 'bucks', 'might', 'seem', 'terribly', 'cheap', 'when', ""'re"", 'working', 'way', 'school', 'six', 'bits', 'hour', 'week', 'wages', 'very', 'expensive', 'establishment', 'was', 'neat', 'clean', 'nothing', 'what', 'must', 'go', 'most', 'people', 'minds', 'when', 'think', 'bordello', 'was', 'policeman', 'came', 'checked', 'ID', 'make', 'certain', 'was', 'old', 'enough', 'drink.So', 'little', 'experience', 'helped', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'Ranch', 'movie', 'involved', 'lives', 'half-dozen', 'prostitutes', 'very', 'real', 'people', 'very', 'real', 'lives', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent', 'people', 'were', 'believable', 'women', 'appeared', 'least', 'partially', 'nude', 'one', 'place', 'was', 'done', 'rather', 'tasteful', 'fashion', 'were', 'only', 'few', 'actual', 'sex', 'scenes', 'were', 'rather', 'low', 'key', 'own', 'experience', ""'d"", 'say', 'bordello', 'was', 'rather', 'large', 'glamorized', 'woman', 'were', 'closer', 'Hollywood', 'versions', 'prostitutes', 'surroundings', 'alas', 'experience', 'limited', 'one', 'visit', 'one', 'bordello', 'was', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'Who', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'today', 'case', 'Ranch', 'rather', 'good', 'movie', 'touching', 'places', 'funny', 'others', 'would', ""n't"", 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'have', 'trouble', 'four', ""'re"", 'just', 'seeking', 'arousal', 'better', 'stuff', ""'re"", 'looking', 'well', 'done', 'interesting', 'adult', 'movie', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'Ranch', 'Gary', 'Peterson']",The Ranch R-Rated Edition

The problem is that so far I haven't been able to find any series box set from Showtime.  This could be described as what you'd get if you mixed ""The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas"" with ""Desperate Housewives"" without any of the singing.  In fact most of the hookers seem to be around the same age group as Desperate Housewives, and a lot alike in appearance.  Only these women's trials and tribulations are around  prostitution while attempting to have some sense of a normal existance in the other areas of their lives.  After watching HBO's ""Cathouse"" this seems to be fairly close to the actual business of a brothel.I only have two problems with this version.  First is that even though this is rated as an ""R"" version it really seems edited for prime time TV.  Some of the dubing over the swearing is almost comical.....My other problem is that this really must be a pilot because there's so many different stories going on, and when it closes there's all these open ends to all these individual stories.If you're going to buy this then I'd look for the uncut version because the ""R"" version seems to have a lot missing.

The well-meaning mother and her young daughter who may be learning too much all too soon, the lesbian, the engaged woman working there for some quick money only to be trapped and inevitably degraded. The tragic, wrecked lives of prostitution... when will we as humans learn?

It's all such an unrewarding human tragedy it's remarkable the entire enterprise of prostitution didn't disappear thousands of years ago.
