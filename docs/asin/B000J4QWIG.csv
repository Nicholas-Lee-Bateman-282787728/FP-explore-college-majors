1025102,A3NZP9VADWAE6K,B000J4QWIG,A.,"[3, 4]","I just finished watching this film. Wow. This was a fantastic film, and I'm amazed that it was made with such a small budget because it was extremely well done. The acting is great, and the story is both believable and deeply emotional; the dialogue and the characters make the story seem perfectly real. Katherine Brooks did an amazing job capturing real emotion, and she told a great story. Normally, I don't think I would be rooting for a student-teacher relationship, but this film was able to capture the image of true love and how love can't be stopped even by society's boundaries; I definitely supported Simone and Annabelle. Erin Kelly (Annabelle) made her character very believable, and Diane Gaidry (Simone) was able to show many emotions without words. The schoolgirls also did wonderful jobs conveying their characters.I highly recommend this film, but only watch it if you have an open mind.",5,Left me speechless...,1168905600,"01 16, 2007",2007,905,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'film', 'Wow', 'was', 'fantastic', 'film', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'was', 'made', 'such', 'small', 'budget', 'was', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'acting', 'great', 'story', 'believable', 'deeply', 'emotional', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'make', 'story', 'seem', 'perfectly', 'real', 'Katherine', 'Brooks', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'capturing', 'real', 'emotion', 'told', 'great', 'story', 'Normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'rooting', 'student-teacher', 'relationship', 'film', 'was', 'able', 'capture', 'image', 'true', 'love', 'how', 'love', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'stopped', 'even', 'society', 'boundaries', 'definitely', 'supported', 'Simone', 'Annabelle', 'Erin', 'Kelly', 'Annabelle', 'made', 'character', 'very', 'believable', 'Diane', 'Gaidry', 'Simone', 'was', 'able', 'show', 'many', 'emotions', 'words', 'schoolgirls', 'also', 'did', 'wonderful', 'jobs', 'conveying', 'characters.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'only', 'watch', 'have', 'open', 'mind']",Loving Annabelle

1025106,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B000J4QWIG,Artist & Author,"[4, 25]","Fortunately, this movie is very short.  Unfortunately, it isn't mercifully short.  By now, you can probably tell that neither my wife nor I found much to like about it.  One aspect of the movie that really grated on me is the music; it felt like a funeral dirge.  As usual in progay movies, the Church has to be made out to be the 'bad guy' because it is the strongest force in society for morality.  When one understands the Divine guidance of the Church, it becomes evident that all these progay movies are an attempt to deny the authority and power of the Divine.The reason I give the movie a D and not an F is that it shows Annabelle as really a social and morality rebel.  If she were in a Moslem school, she probably would have rebelled against the niqab.  In the two previous secular schools she was kicked out of she undoubtedly found other ways to defy the rules.  So, it makes sense that in a Catholic school she would choose one of the Church's most vile sins to throw in the face of the nuns.  There is nothing in the movie that indicates in any way that she had any prenatal or psychological compulsion to homoerotic sex.As for the teacher, she is a pathetic person.  One can't decided if she needed compassion or deserved revulsion.  How could she be a teacher in a Catholic school and not have any apparent sense of moral conflict in this situation?  Was she raised to be such a weak person?  Or was she unconsciously rebelling against Catholic doctrines?  One thing is certain and that is that she was in severe violation of the proper teacher/student relationship.  For that, she seems to have received what she deserved; an outcome that any male teacher in such a position would certainly have experienced.I have enough movies about or for kids to watch two different movies every week for the next twenty five years, never seeing the same movie twice.

Does being unprofessional and inappropriate somehow lack import when it happens between two women? While there are so many opportunities for Annabelle's TEACHER to draw an appropriate and professional line around Annabelle's attempts at seduction, she seems to be completely unable to do so. Nor is she able to draw the line with a boyfriend she clearly has no interest in,  even though she sleeps with him anyway. Nor can this teacher seem to be able to stand up to the Aunt who is her supervisor at work. Simone sets herself up as everybody's doormat - and then wonders why her life falls out from under her. This isn't love, folks. It's seduction, betrayal and lust; which has nothing to do with love. The caring thing for Simone to do would have been to walk away - transfer Annabelle to another classroom, another school, or leave the school herself if she felt her life was getting out of controlOnce the ""love story"" begins, we see no teaching take place. The other students are portrayed as either hostile or understanding, but no one seems to care what is happening to anyone's education, including Annabelle's.There's a reason the rules exist about teachers and students - and it's not just because people ""don't understand.""

I don't watch a heckuvalot of films in the GLBT genre but every now and then I will find one that catches my attention. I recently saw the film ""Loving Annabelle"" starring Erin Kelly as the rebellious and passionate Annabelle and Diane Gaidry as the kind but guarded Simone. Simone is a teacher at a all girls Catholic boarding school. Annabelle is the daughter of a powerful senator who is sent to Simone's school after being expelled from the last school she attended. Annabelle winds up being in Simone's poetry class. Initially the two women clash but eventually their personality differences are tempered when they begin to get to know each other better. Eventually the women's friendship goes beyond platonic which leads to the issue of teacher/student relationship. Instead of making Simone look like a sexual predator, director Katherine Brooks portrays Simone in a more sympathetic light. Simone is plagued with guilt for developing strong romantic feelings for Annabelle.I loved ""Loving Annabelle"" immensely. The writing was strong. The dialogue was not remotely corny as a lot of gay themed films are unfortunately plagued with. I loved both actresses Erin Kelly and Diane Gaidry.

1025121,AP3R7PFGRNBCS,B000J4QWIG,Iryshkidd,"[51, 57]","This new 'hottest movie around' tells a poignant story full of taboo, passion, and hidden lives brimming at the surfaces of these women as they fall deeper into each others worlds.  You're carried along watching Simone's more mature ""self"" struggle to resist the younger, beautiful, and obviously very enlightened, student.  Rebellious Annabelle is young and doesn't demonstrate any real concept of consequence, and is focused on acting on her feelings and thoughts.  This story is tender, real, controversial and compelling.  The film quality is excellent, even if the acting isn't exactly top notch.  Stil, the women and settings are beautiful!  YES, there is seduction, obviously, and man is it wonderful!  The women are just lovely, both actresses are completely sexy and intriguing.  I didn't like the ending, but it absolutely dismantles the ""double standard"" question and says that it isn't OK to seduce students! (but you can also click the 'alternate ending' option in the bonus section to get a happier ending) I loved the way Simone's past was revealed bit by bit along the way; her struggle with heartache and vulnerability - but while possessing intellect and strength at the same time - was so intriguing.  The evolving and maturing Annabelle was refreshing, but so was her youthful tenacity in holding on to her own set of values.

A Catholic all girls school.  (Then again it could have become a very exciting environment for her !)Annabelle is more mature than the other girls.  She has already discovered her sexual orientation, drinks, smokes, etc..  So right there she's on a collision course with Mother Immaculata.She starts to feel a strong attraction to and bond with the poetry teacher who coincidentally has also experienced a separation from her former 'friend'.There's some religious symbolism in the movie as Mother Immaculata forces Annabelle to wear these gigantic rosary beads around her neck like a ball and chain because she refuses to take off her Buddist prayer beads.  Those rosary beads sort of symbolize the heavy weight that has been placed on her feelings I guess.But don't worry.  Annabelle is young, strong, beautiful, and relentless in pursuing the object of her affections.Along the way she rejects the advances of one of the other girls who just wants to 'experiment'.  Rather she longs for the poetry teacher who is more mature and wants the same things.This is one of those movies where the sexual tension builds against the backdrop of oppression and restrictions.In a movie like this the teacher's boyfriend, the Church, society, and even the government are all ""the enemy"".  All of those institutions only undermine and frustrate what these individuals really want.Nowadays I don't know how realistic it would be for something like this to happen.  Rather they would most likely just go away together.But it could perhaps happen if this forbidden relationship threatens the teacher's job for example.Jeff MarzanoImages in a ConventPossession",4,A Forbidden Love,1197158400,"12 9, 2007",2007,1875,"['caught', 'movie', 'Logo', 'Channel', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'dvd', 'figured', ""'d"", 'write', 'review', 'anyway.It', 'story', 'rebellious', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'put', 'what', 'very', 'repressive', 'frustrating', 'environment', 'Catholic', 'girls', 'school', 'Then', 'again', 'could', 'have', 'become', 'very', 'exciting', 'environment', 'Annabelle', 'more', 'mature', 'other', 'girls', 'already', 'discovered', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'drinks', 'smokes', 'etc..', 'So', 'right', 'collision', 'course', 'Mother', 'Immaculata.She', 'feel', 'strong', 'attraction', 'bond', 'poetry', 'teacher', 'who', 'coincidentally', 'also', 'experienced', 'separation', 'former', 'religious', 'symbolism', 'movie', 'Mother', 'Immaculata', 'forces', 'Annabelle', 'wear', 'gigantic', 'rosary', 'beads', 'neck', 'ball', 'chain', 'take', 'off', 'Buddist', 'prayer', 'beads', 'rosary', 'beads', 'sort', 'symbolize', 'heavy', 'weight', 'been', 'placed', 'feelings', 'guess.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'Annabelle', 'young', 'strong', 'beautiful', 'relentless', 'pursuing', 'object', 'affections.Along', 'way', 'advances', 'one', 'other', 'girls', 'who', 'just', ""'experiment"", 'poetry', 'teacher', 'who', 'more', 'mature', 'same', 'things.This', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'sexual', 'tension', 'builds', 'backdrop', 'oppression', 'restrictions.In', 'movie', 'teacher', 'boyfriend', 'Church', 'society', 'even', 'government', 'are', 'enemy', 'institutions', 'only', 'undermine', 'frustrate', 'what', 'individuals', 'really', 'want.Nowadays', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'realistic', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'happen', 'Rather', 'would', 'most', 'likely', 'just', 'go', 'away', 'could', 'perhaps', 'happen', 'forbidden', 'relationship', 'teacher', 'job', 'example.Jeff', 'MarzanoImages', 'ConventPossession']",Loving Annabelle

Menta, Jr.","[1, 3]","To paraphrase the director in one of the DVD's special features interviews, the aim of ""Loving Annabelle"" was to tell a story about a teacher/student relationship that didn't automatically condemn every aspect of the relationship as irresponsible and horrible.  You may find that to be a gutsy approach or a reprehensible one (we can talk about my own feelings over a beer if you want), but if you seek out this movie, I'm guessing that you're at least open to the idea of pretending such a relationship isn't all that bad so you can enjoy the sensual adult fare the film offers.Alas, for those of you in such a category, I'm sad to report that there isn't very much sensual adult fare in ""Loving Annabelle"".  There's only fleeting, rare nudity and fleeting, rare, and (sigh) discreetly-filmed sex.  And that's strange, because one of the director's other motivations for making the movie was (I'm paraphrasing her again) ""...to show some really hot stuff, the kind of stuff that turns me on, the kind of stuff I really like to do and have done to me when I'm in a hot relationship.""  I guess the director really enjoys endless worrying and endless discussions about what's right and wrong about her life.To be fair, the story is watchable and not entirely uninteresting, just not very shocking and, to get serious for a moment, not very thematically ambitious (see, I'm not just interested in sex).  In other words, typical traditional moralism, that firmly reinforces the social status quo, is very much in place at the end.So, throughout the film, you don't get much that's all that compelling story-wise, and you don't get much erotically-charged material, either.  And sometimes what erotic content you do get almost seems to be there accidentally.  For example, all the scenes of the girls in their Catholic school uniforms smack of unintentional fetishism instead of an honest attempt to show what such schools are really like.  But I guess viewers have to take what stimulating elements they can get here.I will say this: we learn from the extra features that the movie was filmed on a shoestring budget and took forever to finish due to money issues; it's to its credit, then, that the movie looks as good as it does.In the end, ""Loving Annabelle"" is well acted and works fine as a sort of R-rated (and a soft ""R"", at that) ""Lifetime"" movie.

Rebellious teen Annabelle however, is not moved by the situation. She smokes on school property, drinks with her dorm mates and in general breaks the rules.After Annabelle is introduced to beautiful poetry teacher Simone Bradley (Diane Gaidry), she is instantly smitten.  Initially Simone dismisses her advances, but Annabelle's relentless pursuit leaves her unsettled. Simone has her own problems; a boyfriend she is avoiding commitment with is pressuring her to move in with him. Annabelle has stirred up long suppressed memories of the love Simone and high school sweetheart Amanda shared. Fighting valiantly against her growing attraction to Annabelle, Simone visits the chapel to pray for guidance. The situation comes to a head at a school dance when Annabelle sings a love song to Simone. In sudden dawning of the true depths of her attraction, Simone leaves the dance. When Annabelle follows, she isn't able to contain her emotions any longer and kisses her passionately. Continued in Simone's dorm room, the two women make passionate love to the rumble of the thunderstorm overhead. The next morning however, the women must rush to dress as Mother Immaculata's footsteps echo in the hallway.Out writer-director, Katherine Brooks presents an intensely romantic love scene as the rain pours down outside, the women's inhibitions are cast off.

It is a lesbian film for the sake of being a lesbian film. The main character is way too mature for her age, she reflects none of the personality that seems to have put her into the school (juvanile, destruction, rebellious), and the romance is a really creepy underage courtship disguised as a lesbian story. There is no actual cohesive sort of story that contains characters with quirks or feeling, minus, very conditionally, the cutter and the girl who is super mean to her. I really don't want to go into spoilers, but at the same time i would feel bad for creating an air of mystery around the movie that piques anyones interest any further, even though there are a ton of positive reviews. Back to the movie, it's a mess of odd romantic scenes and the obvious sort of stereotypical ""oh being gay is weird but also interesting"" dialogue and opinions. I recently watched ""Imagine You and Me"", and while the movie is more of a traditional romantic-comedy, the whole idea of homosexuality actually mixes it up, and isn't the sort of odd centerpiece that exists solely to exist, but works subtly to show that it is no different than heterosexuality. Not to speak of the other too much, but it showcases everything wrong with Loving Annabelle: it has no reason to exist. The people who made it it wanted to make a lesbian movie, not a story involving lesbians. There is a difference, one is coincidental and meaningful (because just like in real life it doesn't change everything), while the other is extremely pretentious, exploitative, and just takes advantage of the market for movies with girls kissing. Sorry for the ramble to anyone who reads, but the base is that this movie is shallow, lacking in emotion or real personalities, and kind of glosses over pedophilia like it's secondary to...well the movie never really conveys that trump-point.Go watch Imagine You and ME.

The movie is not that bad but, it lacks foundation for the characters, for the storyline and even for the back-stories. The director just lays everything out, without tying it to anything, giving it a reason to be or a meaning.The movie fails at the very beginning because it fails develop and ""explain"" why Annabelle falls for Simone. Honestly, why does she like her so much? There are very few scenes that barely, if at all, present the start and development of the crush.The movie also fails to explore the relationship between Simone and her aunt, and her ex-girlfriend. Characters do things which seem out a character and without any reason. And the reason for this is that they have no foundation.There are many wasted scenes, and too many lingering looks that amount to nothing. The time could have been better used developing the story. The movie takes 72 of its 77 minutes getting Annabelle and Simone together and then abruptly ends, in a not so happy ending (but at least a realistic one), without any explanation of what happened later (watch the alternate ending). Basically, this movie is 72 minutes of foreplay with a 1 minute climax that falls flat.The movie is not that bad, but it was poorly fleshed out. The acting is not the best, it is emotionless at times (especially when it should be VERY emotional), and it is also a bit too restrained. The character of Simone (Gaidry) is boring, inconsequential and uni-dimensional. She could have been better if her story had been given some dimension and background. On the other hand, the character of Annabelle (Kelly) is absolutely mesmerizing. She played the character perfectly. Kelly basically carried the movie. The movie needed better editing and better direction.

So when Annabelle arrives at boarding school, I was expecting her to hookup with the rebellious Cat.  But then the moment Annabelle gives her poetry teacher a thorough head-to-toe once-over during class, I realized this film was going to take us in a far different direction, and I'm glad for it.  How many times have we been attracted to the wrong person and couldn't help it anyway?  And there's a real struggle there. We watch the teacher's life implode in slow-motion. Everything she'd built up around her begins to crumble and scare her; and the catalyst for that is a student who refuses to compromise herself. Simone and Annabelle are like two sides of the same coin--the older woman more world-weary and shut down, and the younger one more idealistic and open to new possibilities and being true to herself (and encourages Simone to do the same).  I have to say the actress who plays Simone does an extraordinary job, presenting Simone as someone cautious and yet human and open--reluctantly and believably not immune to Annabelle's advances. And Erin Kelly as Annabelle is smouldering.  So much of the communication and chemistry between them develop through glances, and the eyes of these actresses are soul-achingly deep.  I was, in fact, rooting for them for the whole movie, despite the age difference, despite the impropriety and rule-breaking. It is an interestingly sympathetic look at what is often sensationalized in the press, with the older teacher being demonized. In the context of this movie you get two sympathetic leads in a difficult spot.  The movie, while clearly loving these characters, doesn't go easy on them.  This movie was a big surprise--far better than I expected. And, as anothe reviewer said, the sex scene when Simone finally succumbs feels entirely believable and hot.

1025147,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000J4QWIG,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Loving Annabelle (Katherine Brooks, 2006)A couple of months before I am writing this review, the readers of website afterellen.com named Loving Annabelle one of the ten best lesbian/bi movies ever made. (It came in at #9.) I can't claim to have seen more than a handful of movies that made the top 50, and I also haven't seen--though not for lack of trying--the movie this is a remake/reboot/reimagining/whatever the kids are calling it these days of, the 1931 German feature Madchen in Uniform. So I'm coming into this about as pristine as I can, and maybe that's not the best position from which to review this; I don't know enough about it, so take that with as much salt as necessary. But with all that said, I'll tell you that aside from some pacing problems (odd in a film that runs just seventy-five minutes), I found this movie quite enjoyable, with solid performances turned in by the principals, a sufficiently nasty pair of antagonists, and well, if I tell you everything I liked about this movie we'd be getting way into spoiler territory, so you'll just have to trust me on this one.Plot: Annabelle Tillman (Brooks regular Erin Kelly), the daughter of an outspoken American senator, has been transferred to a strict Catholic all-girls' school after being thrown out of her last two schools. She immediately butts heads with the headmaster, Mother Immaculata (Ladybugs' Ilene Graff), and soon finds herself roped into a tempestuous love/hate relationship with dorm neighbor Cat (Gustine Fudickar in her only screen appearance to date). However, she's really interested in her English teacher, the unhappily-married Simone Bradley (The Dogwalker's Diane Gaidry in her final feature appearance as I write this in January 2013), and launches a campaign to woo her. Can such a romance survive the crossing of so many ethical and religious barriers?Like many of my favorite romance films, Loving Annabelle is less about the hot, sweaty monkey sex than it is about the tension of the waiting, the chase, the slow burn that happens before anyone hops into bed. You can never be quite sure, even as it becomes obvious that Simone is falling for the fetching Annabelle (and come on, who wouldn't?), if these two are ever going to get together; Annabelle, being young and brash, isn't looking at the long-term problems, while Simone is constantly wrestling with them. (""We're not doing anything wrong,"" Annabelle says at one point. In a Catholic school? Oh, if only things were as simple as Annabelle believes them to be.) Brooks, though, isn't quite as good behind a camera as are directors like Nicole Conn (Cynara: Poetry in Motion) and Christopher Ashley (Jeffrey), especially when it comes to the pacing of the thing. As I said, this movie runs just seventy-five minutes, and there are parts in the first half-hour where things drag.

The plot was so irritating I didn't want to watch it after the spring break scenes but the ending was so abrupt that it left me checking the time bar to see if there was going to be a flash forward to 10 years later when they ended up together at an appropriate time in their lives! The beginning dragged on for 40 minutes with the background and the climax and ending was literally less then 5 minutes of the movie.So many characters with such complexity and yet the story never reveals much about any of them. It's like a cliffhanger movie-- leaves you wanting more on every story line but not a single one gets finished.The build up to the climax was artfully written and acted. I believed the 2 main characters roles and I completely empathized with Simone's pain & struggle trying to live a straight life and cope with the loss of a girlfriend that couldn't take living in guilt and shame anymore. I found myself more often than not just annoyed with the oversexed Annabelle. Her character felt like a typical 16 year old that wants to appear to know it all and be grown and completely short sited as is expected for someone in her age group. I felt the ""lust"" I did not see the ""lovingannabelle"" but perhaps that was due to the lack of maturity on Annabelle's part. The story never really digs in to Annabelle as a person other than the superficial bad girl act and the absentee mother issue. There was nothing to fall in love with other than her body-- which isn't exactly ""love"". I'm never okay with the teacher/student boundary crossing no matter the gender or the age of the main pursuer so that made it hard to feel happy about the climax of them finally being together. For such a strong & calculated character to do something so stupid as to have sex with a student ON campus with school in session simply wasn't believable and felt like the writers got lazy and threw a quick fix on the ending.I am glad they didn't try to make the teacher have a different fate than that of a man who gets too familiar with his students so I'm not against the fact that she got arrested-- and happy to see a Catholic school actually call the authorities!! But I just thought it was a weak ending in comparison to the start of the movie. It all just seems unfinished.As a lesbian I'm glad to see movies that feature our stories and that's the only reason I watched this. Nothing about this story is appealing to me.

Simone first becomes aware of Annabelle when Annabelle uses Rilke to get inside Simone's head to seduce her--sex and love can be one, especially if the sex is really good sex. . . I was half expecting jabs at the patriarchal symbolism of the Catholic Church; however the ""bad Catholic"" in the film is a controlling woman, not a man. The true patriarch in the film is a priest who has given up control, instead imparting wisdom and compassion when he can. There are several conflicts here, the strongest is conveyed when the head mistress asks Simone hadn't she ever thought what she was doing was wrong, and Simone's reply was yes, she had thought about it at every instant. The most interesting character to me was Cat, aptly named because she pounces on anything, mauling it, without really meaning to--it's just her nature. Annabelle is a skilled seductress but she misjudges the lethality of Cat. Cat is the irritant, the grain of sand that makes pearls, and poetry.",4,An Intelligent Film,1187136000,"08 15, 2007",2007,1008,"['film', 'built', 'Rilke', 'poetry', 'Simone', 'first', 'aware', 'Annabelle', 'when', 'Annabelle', 'Rilke', 'get', 'Simone', 'head', 'seduce', 'sex', 'love', 'can', 'be', 'one', 'especially', 'sex', 'really', 'good', 'sex', 'was', 'half', 'expecting', 'jabs', 'patriarchal', 'symbolism', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'however', 'bad', 'Catholic', 'film', 'controlling', 'woman', 'not', 'man', 'true', 'patriarch', 'film', 'priest', 'who', 'given', 'up', 'control', 'instead', 'imparting', 'wisdom', 'compassion', 'when', 'can', 'are', 'several', 'conflicts', 'here', 'strongest', 'conveyed', 'when', 'head', 'mistress', 'Simone', 'had', ""n't"", 'ever', 'thought', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'was', 'wrong', 'Simone', 'reply', 'was', 'yes', 'had', 'thought', 'instant', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'was', 'Cat', 'aptly', 'named', 'anything', 'mauling', 'really', 'meaning', 'just', 'nature', 'Annabelle', 'skilled', 'seductress', 'lethality', 'Cat', 'Cat', 'irritant', 'grain', 'sand', 'pearls', 'poetry']",Loving Annabelle

1025168,A3B26C1WRMBEAC,B000J4QWIG,Zoe Marr,"[2, 2]","The ""secret"" to this film's 'success' is essentially by taking three fetishes (catholic school, teacher/student, and lesbian)and rolling them together into a sloppy film. It's guaranteed audience and buzz. I'm not going to say it doesn't live up to any of it - if it's the love scene people want, they don't necessarily cop out. That said, it's pretty obvious this is a first time full length feature directorial debut, because this movie is such a mess. So many characters are underdeveloped or unnecessary, several scenes don't work, and much of it needed to be reshot and reworked. It isn't a long movie as it is, and clearly they took whatever takes they could assemble and tossed them in. The logic is also void in many scenes, such as this ""forbidden"" affair happening in plain sight, like sharing a cigarette on campus or making out in front of the busiest school dance. A script supervisor was desperately in need here as was more consistency and a better script. Diane Gaidry's performance is really what saved this movie from being rated a 1, and that was just a lucky accident. Try watching it more than once and see how quickly it loses its ability to hold up in any credible way.",2,Most overrated lesbian film of all time,1355702400,"12 17, 2012",2012,1192,"['secret', 'film', ""'success"", 'essentially', 'taking', 'three', 'fetishes', 'catholic', 'school', 'teacher/student', 'lesbian', 'rolling', 'together', 'sloppy', 'film', 'guaranteed', 'audience', 'buzz', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'say', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'love', 'scene', 'people', 'want', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'cop', 'out', 'said', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'first', 'time', 'full', 'length', 'feature', 'directorial', 'debut', 'movie', 'such', 'mess', 'So', 'many', 'characters', 'are', 'underdeveloped', 'unnecessary', 'several', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'much', 'needed', 'be', 'reshot', 'reworked', ""n't"", 'long', 'movie', 'clearly', 'took', 'could', 'assemble', 'tossed', 'logic', 'also', 'void', 'many', 'scenes', 'such', 'forbidden', 'affair', 'happening', 'plain', 'sight', 'sharing', 'cigarette', 'campus', 'making', 'out', 'front', 'busiest', 'school', 'dance', 'script', 'supervisor', 'was', 'desperately', 'need', 'here', 'was', 'more', 'consistency', 'better', 'script', 'Diane', 'Gaidry', 'performance', 'really', 'what', 'saved', 'movie', 'being', 'rated', '1', 'was', 'just', 'lucky', 'accident', 'Try', 'watching', 'more', 'once', 'see', 'how', 'quickly', 'ability', 'hold', 'up', 'credible', 'way']",Loving Annabelle
