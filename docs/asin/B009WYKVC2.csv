Thank you, Paley Center, for making this video available.Without being obnoxious about attending the event, I'll try to give an honest overview of what it was like in person. The event began with an introduction about Paley Center and its role in preserving television history. Without any set-up of what would be shown other than an example of the films maintained in the Paley Center archive, a film clip began. The large screen over the stage filled with the image of a 30-something David McCallum, and the audience was generous with its applause and cheers. The clip was a scene from &#34;The Pop Art Affair&#34;, an episode of &#34;The Man From U.N.C.L.E.&#34; Set in a coffee shop, a girl named Sylvia chatted with and sketched Illya and his &#34;Dostoyevsky eyes&#34;. That brief scene gave the event a nice spark of excitement. After the &#34;Pop Art&#34; clip, the NCIS Season 7 episode, &#34;Mother's Day&#34; (broadcast on CBS the following night), was shown in its entirety, and the audience was beyond thrilled.The PaleyFest video starts immediately after &#34;Mother's Day&#34; was shown, with Kevin Frazier's bringing the NCIS gang onto the stage.Will viewers of the video sense the thrill of the evening?To be honest, the vibe of the live event may not be there. Fans of Pauley Perrette should know that she did not attend the PaleyFest event; at the time, she was in Paris on a photo-shoot for the CBS &#34;Watch&#34; magazine. The NCIS group is not your average cast, though. They are phenomenally talented and entertaining, so this isn't your average cast interview.",5,It's tough to be objective,1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,1723,"[""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'can', 'critique', 'video', 'objectively', 'was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'attend', 'PaleyFest', 'event', 'will', 'try', 'Thank', 'Paley', 'Center', 'making', 'video', 'being', 'obnoxious', 'attending', 'event', ""'ll"", 'try', 'give', 'honest', 'overview', 'what', 'was', 'person', 'event', 'began', 'introduction', 'Paley', 'Center', 'role', 'preserving', 'television', 'history', 'set-up', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'shown', 'other', 'example', 'films', 'maintained', 'Paley', 'Center', 'archive', 'film', 'clip', 'began', 'large', 'screen', 'stage', 'filled', 'image', '30-something', 'David', 'McCallum', 'audience', 'was', 'generous', 'applause', 'cheers', 'clip', 'was', 'scene', '34', 'Pop', 'Art', 'Affair', '34', 'episode', '34', 'Man', 'From', 'U.N.C.L.E.', '34', 'Set', 'coffee', 'shop', 'girl', 'named', 'Sylvia', 'chatted', 'sketched', 'Illya', '34', 'Dostoyevsky', 'eyes', '34', 'brief', 'scene', 'gave', 'event', 'nice', 'spark', 'excitement', '34', 'Pop', 'Art', '34', 'clip', 'NCIS', 'Season', '7', 'episode', '34', 'Mother', 'Day', '34', 'broadcast', 'CBS', 'following', 'night', 'was', 'shown', 'entirety', 'audience', 'was', 'thrilled.The', 'PaleyFest', 'video', 'immediately', '34', 'Mother', 'Day', '34', 'was', 'shown', 'Kevin', 'Frazier', 'bringing', 'NCIS', 'gang', 'stage.Will', 'viewers', 'video', 'sense', 'thrill', 'evening', 'be', 'honest', 'vibe', 'live', 'event', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'there', 'Fans', 'Pauley', 'Perrette', 'should', 'know', 'did', 'not', 'attend', 'PaleyFest', 'event', 'time', 'was', 'Paris', 'photo-shoot', 'CBS', '34', 'Watch', '34', 'magazine', 'NCIS', 'group', 'not', 'average', 'cast', 'though', 'are', 'phenomenally', 'talented', 'entertaining', ""n't"", 'average', 'cast', 'interview']",N/A
