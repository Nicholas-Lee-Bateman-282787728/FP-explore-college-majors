It was cheap though to get a used copy on Amazon but this is much better. I really enjoyed it a lot. I only wish more would come but it may not because of poor DVD sales. It has been over 4 years and I really hope for more to come. I'm just glad I got it. It's really funny and I love it.

After The Jeffersons got the Nielsen axe in July 1985,ten and a half years after it premiered,Gibbs was not out of a job,since 227 became a sitcom which she starred in as well,premiering two months later(after the Jeffersons' cancellation). 227 had fellow residents at NBC at the time of premiere,those being The Cosby Show,Cheers and Family Ties,which were all long-running Emmy-winning sitcoms as well. Yes,Gibbs sure was movin' on up,but 227 got the Nielsen axe in 1990. During the run,some of her Jeffersons co-stars guest-starred in a few episodes,one being Franklin Cover who was Tom Willis(on the Jeffersons).

842211,A19TIMSEQ0RK9X,B0002O7Y8U,"Anthony Dickerson ""aldp""","[15, 15]","I will echo the praise of other reviewers here for this show.  It's one of my favorite sitcoms from the mid to late 80s.  The casting is perfect, the stories well written.  Marla Gibbs and Jackee Harry are a joy to watch.The reason I'm giving this dvd only three stars is because the episode sequencing on the set is the worst I've ever seen.  Instead of following the airing order, which is the way the show should be viewed, I think they followed the production order.  What this means is that after watching the pilot episode on disc one you will have to go to another disc to watch the second part of that story.  They do not tell you this anywhere on the set.The proper airing order can be viewed at tv.com.  This is the way the creators of the show intended viewers to watch it.  You'll understand why once you see the sequence.  Unfortunately, to watch it the way it was meant to be watched one has to alternate back and forth between discs which can get real annoying real quick.I'm also shocked that only the first season has been released after all this time.  Is this not selling well?  Regardless of the crazy episode sequencing this is one terrific show and I'll buy it no matter how they release it.",3,"Great Show, Crazy Episode Sequencing",1199318400,"01 3, 2008",2008,1213,"['will', 'echo', 'praise', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'show', 'one', 'favorite', 'sitcoms', 'mid', 'late', '80s', 'casting', 'perfect', 'stories', 'well', 'written', 'Marla', 'Gibbs', 'Jackee', 'Harry', 'are', 'joy', 'watch.The', 'reason', ""'m"", 'giving', 'dvd', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'episode', 'sequencing', 'set', 'worst', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Instead', 'following', 'airing', 'order', 'way', 'show', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'think', 'followed', 'production', 'order', 'What', 'watching', 'pilot', 'episode', 'disc', 'one', 'will', 'have', 'go', 'disc', 'watch', 'second', 'part', 'story', 'do', 'not', 'tell', 'anywhere', 'set.The', 'proper', 'airing', 'order', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'tv.com', 'way', 'creators', 'show', 'intended', 'viewers', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'why', 'once', 'see', 'sequence', 'Unfortunately', 'watch', 'way', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'watched', 'one', 'alternate', 'back', 'forth', 'discs', 'can', 'get', 'real', 'annoying', 'real', 'quick.I', ""'m"", 'also', 'shocked', 'only', 'first', 'season', 'been', 'released', 'time', 'not', 'selling', 'well', 'Regardless', 'crazy', 'episode', 'sequencing', 'one', 'terrific', 'show', ""'ll"", 'buy', 'matter', 'how', 'release']",227 - The Complete First Season

The only thing that was a little annoying was during what they labled the pilot epiosde, it mentions that Rose inherits the building from her landlord who died, but the next few episodes, they make reference to him as if he was still alive. The episodes are a bit out of sequence.On Disc three, they have a few special features one of which a ""reunion"" between Marla Gibbs, Alaina Reed-Hall and Jackee'.

842220,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B0002O7Y8U,Dorrie Wheeler,"[37, 39]","It is really great that Columbia Tri Star is brining back some of the class African-American comedies from the 70's and 80's to DVD.  These shows were enjoyed by all.  The first season of 227 we really learn about the foundation of the characters on 227, Mary, Lester and her daughter Brenda. It was nice to see Marla Gibb in a role where she wasn't a maid but a wife and mother.  Her and Lester had a nice family. The late Helen Martin shines as the elderly wise cracking neighbor Pearl and Jackee Harry is quite funny as Sexy Sandra.  I really enjoy this show because these were working class people who often found themselves in funny predicaments that usually were solved by the end of the show.  Some of the funniest episodes on this set include the episode when the people in the building think they have won the lottery, the episode when Brenda has a crush on Calvin and turns to Sandra for advice and the first episode when Mary accidently hits a car and leaves a note on the car only to have another car come along and almost destroy the car.

Rose inherits the building and all of the building violations that busybody Mary reported to the housing bureau (because she thought Sandra would be the new owner). This episode also was a ""to be continued"" episode.The Sidewalk Sale (November 2, 1985)The tenants all pull together and have a sidewalk sale to raise money to help Rose save the building. They almost lose the money when it's put inside a lamp that was sold.A Letter to the President (November 9, 1985)Mary writes a letter of complaint to the president about the street potholes.

When he comes to Mary's apartment (to meet Sandra) he inadvertently meets Rose. The two hit it off and he asks Rose to go with him on a trip to New York. Rose agrees to go but is afraid of what may happen.Brenda's Last Date (January 11, 1986)Pearl asks Mary if Lester would have a man-to-man talk with Calvin about sex and Brenda asks her parents if she could go to the dance Friday night.

I think we can all acknowledge that 227 may have started out as Marla Gibbs show, but it quickly became a showcase for the comedic stylings of the modern day humor genius we know as Jackee. Jackee started as a bit player on the show, but audiences were so delighted and impressed that a man could play a woman's role so convincingly, that she was catapulted into superstardom. Way before Tyler Perry, Jackee donned a dress and stirred a nation into unadulterated delirium with her beautifully coiffed, but oozing of testosterone portrayal of Sandra Clark. While Jackee appeared on talk shows and at awards shows in drag, he was very good at not revealing his actual name and where he lived. So what's become of him? I'm not sure.

It rivaled ""The Cosby Show"" in terms of the family element and themes.  I thought that Jackee Harry's character of sassy Sandra was so funny, always coming to Mary Jenkins' apartment in her flashy, colorful dresses. Every week she was wearing something different. I was impressed by how Marla Gibbs would go from one successful show of ""The Jeffersons"" to another successful show in ""227"" all within a 15-year span!  I still can't get over how NBC scheduled the show in its final season of 1990, putting it on Sunday against very high rated shows like ""Murder She Wrote.""  But for the first four seasons from 1985 to 1989, they produced their best output. Regina King's start on this show set the tone for her roles in movies such as Jerry McGuire, Daddy Day Care, Boyz N The Hood, Ray and many others.

I never expected it, yet this has always (and probably always will be) my favorite sitcom of all time. I grew up with it, and it was always the one that I could relate to the most.227 has its occasional flaws (inconsistent writing). And this was especially true in the first season. But what makes it work to this day - and what keeps me coming back for more -- is the sense of realness in the characters. Even when the situations are totally unrealistic or the writing leaves something to be desired, the actors give you the feeling that they really could be your neighbors! They each have such distinctive personalities, that you can't help but be entertained and be left with a ""feel-good"" feeling. They brought a lot of experience to the table (especially Helen Martin and Marla Gibbs), and even more importantly, they had a real chemistry!While some may dismiss the show as not exciting enough, one of the things that I always find comforting about this show is that it never gets overly ambitious to the point of feeling forced. Still, there is always something unique, funny, or fishy stirring -- but the focus on the home and/or family atmosphere is somehow always maintained.I truly do hope that we will get more seasons of this gem on DVD (though I am a bit dubious).

842236,AKIV6FWJPWZ0Y,B0002O7Y8U,"Tara Plumeri ""Snow Bunny""","[12, 13]","227: The Complete First Season is a classic series. Pull up a milk crate and take up a space on the stoop - you'll be laughing in no time.Marla Gibbs, within a few weeks of her last performance as the smart-mouthed maid Florence on The Jeffersons, Gibbs purchased the rights to a stage play called 227, had it developed into a sitcom, and began filming the new series. In July 1985, The Jeffersons ran for the last time on CBS. Two months later, on September 14, 1985, 227 joined NBC's Saturday night lineup.Set in Washington, DC, the series follows the residents of building number 227, a solidly middle-class apartment house located in a neighbor that is rapidly becoming gentrified with posh condominiums. Gibbs plays Mary Jenkins, a no-nonsense housewife. Mary's construction supervisor husband, Lester (Hal Williams), is a caring, dependable father to their teenage daughter, Brenda (Regina King). Mary's best friend is Rose Lee Holloway (Alaina Reed-Hall), a gossipy widow. The two pals love to sit on the stoop and discuss their lives.and the lives of anyone else who happens to wander by. Sandra Clark (Jackee Harry) is the building's resident vamp, a sashaying mantrap whose haughty attitude often sets her at odds with down-to-earth Mary. Pearl Shay (Helen Martin) is an elderly busybody who observes all of 227's comings and goings from her perch at the window of her first floor apartment. Rounding out the building's principal residents are Calvin (Curtis Baldwin), Pearl's seventeen year-old grandson (and Brenda's boyfriend), and Rose's daughter Tiffany (Kia Goodwin).One reason that the show is so fresh is that its characters are relatively unique, especially for a show created in 1985. Rather than depicting African-Americans living in poverty (Sanford & Son, Good Times) or as nouveau riche (The Cosby Show, The Jeffersons), Gibbs developed the show, in part, because she wanted the nation's large black middle-class to be portrayed on TV. The result is that the characters and their concerns can be easily related to by a broad cross section of viewers. The show is warm and funny, with the residents of the building serving as an extended family to each other, and to its viewers.The entire cast is strong - Gibbs especially proves her versatility by playing a character that is completely unlike snappy Florence - but Jackee Harry is the show's breakout star. She has the gift of being able to deliver even the dullest of lines in a way that provokes laughs. With her clingy dresses, mincing walk, and honey-coated buzz-saw vocal style, she manages to steal almost every scene in which she appears.Several guest stars appear in the first season. The Naked Gun's Leslie Nielson plays a Secret Service agent who investigates Mary when she writes a ""Letter to the President."" Wrestling weirdo (and Cyndi Lauper video star) Captain Lou Albano plays an old associate of Lester's who is hired to be 227's handyman, but harbors a big secret (not to mention several rubber bands in his beard) in ""We the People."" In ""Fifty Big Ones,"" Beah Richards (Roots: The Next Generations) and Whitman Mayo (Sanford & Son) play Mary's parents who come to town to celebrate their 50th by renewing their marriage vows.provided they even want to stay married.One interesting fact is the episodes are presented here in production order, not broadcast order. Ordinarily, this wouldn't really be a problem for a sitcom. Here, however, it is a small flaw. The pilot episode was actually aired six episodes into the series. Since it was produced first, it is presented as the first episode on disc one. The pilot features a cliffhanger ending that is continued in ""The Sidewalk Sale."" ""Sidewalk"" was not filmed until later on in the season, so it appears as the first episode on disc two. Since the packaging does not indicate that the episodes are part one and part two of a single story, viewers will be left to figure out for themselves that the conclusion of the first episode in the set is actually found on disc tw  :)The twenty-two episodes that make up the first season are divided onto three discs. The discs are housed in slim, clear keepcases. The front covers are yellow and each feature a separate, small cast photo. The back covers include episode numbers, episode titles, plot synopses, and basic creative credits. The double-sided coversheets show through to the inside of the case, but the interiors are simply solid yellow. The DVDs are black with ""227"" printed in a bold yellow font. The three keepcases slide into a cardboard sleeve which showcases Gibbs and Harry in front of a stoop.The DVD menus feature static cast photos. Viewers can play all episodes or choose an individual episode. Although there are no scene selection menus, chapter stops are included.ExtrasAll of the extras are found on disc three. First up is ""From Stage to Screen: 227,"" a six minute look at the play that inspired the series. Interviews with playwright Christine Houston, star Marla Gibbs, and co-creator/producer/writer Bill Boulware help to explain the process by which the show moved from stage to screen.The six minute, thirty second ""Three Ladies Remembering 227"" gathers Alaina Reed, Jackee Harry, and Gibbs for a lively discussion of the series. The three are charming and fun to watch.""Stories from the Stoop"" is a twenty minute featurette on the making of the series, featuring interviews with the show's stars and creative team, including Gibbs, Harry, Reed, Hal Williams, playwright Houston, directors Gerren Keith and Arlando Smith, Bill Boulware, executive producer Dick Bensfield, and co-producer Roxie Wenk-Evans. The enthusiasm of the participants is infectious, making this (and the set's other extras) a must-see for fans.",5,"~* With your family around you, you're never alone ~*",1158624000,"09 19,

842237,AMWL7XIWIPXEZ,B0002O7Y8U,Twiddles42,"[5, 12]","Glad I don't own a HDTV set, the compression artifacting would drive me nuts.Columbia/Tri-Star TV show releases are typically appalling in terms of video quality.  With the advent of ""Married With Children"", at 9 episodes per disc, numerous complaints were made by others regarding video quality.But 227's mammoth 10 episodes per disc?No sale from me, sorry.  There's no way they can fit that many onto a disc, at that price, without sacrificing a lot.  DVD was peddled to the public with a promise of higher quality.  Columbia/Tri-star releases are next of kin to VHS in terms of video quality.  So I shall live without.I will say this:  Columbia is taking a step in the RIGHT direction by including extras.But video quality counts too, even if it is ""just a sitcom"".  As DVDs can last 25+ years, I find it dumb to buy it now and then wait for DVD's successor (blu-ray) where they'll sell the same titles again, using the cheapest methods possible.  Don't we customers deserve better?  If I delivered poor quality work, I'd be sacked.  And it's my time to give Columbia the pink slip.
