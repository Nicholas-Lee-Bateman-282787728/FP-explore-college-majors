1367904,A2SWW3OWEGLN2O,B003VTKZ84,Andrew Kear,"[1, 1]","It is strange that one of the most celebrated sitcoms is not shown that much anymore, despite once being a staple of Nick at Night for several years. What is interesting is how the characters become more fleshed-out as the series progressed. Mary become less shy and Ted, the usually inept anchorman shows he is smarter than we think. The one character that stays himself throughout the whole series is Lou Grant, who is still an authoritative figure and tires quickly of Ted's behavior.The first few seasons of the Mary Tyler Moore show addressed issues that were rarely touched by Network Television, with the exception of course of All in the Family. However, unlike other sitcoms the characters in this show displayed genuine affection for each other. They even sympathize with Ted after his heart attack in the episode ""Ted's change of heart"".  Only a show like Mary Tyler Moore could successfully pull this off because the characters where so well developed.In many ways the last few seasons of Mary Tyler Moore was a precursor to more sophisticated sitcoms like Taxi and Cheers. Those shows had many of the same elements as the Mary Tyler Moore show in that they treated risqu&eacute; subject matters with some degree of sophistication.I was never really happy in the way the Mary Tyler Moore show ended. I guess the producers were trying to be ironic in having Ted the only member of the show not fired for bad ratings. The reason the ending was touching is because we got to know the characters so well that seeing then leave was like saying goodbye to an old friend.",5,Classic Show,1330387200,"02 28, 2012",2012,1576,"['strange', 'one', 'most', 'celebrated', 'sitcoms', 'not', 'shown', 'much', 'anymore', 'once', 'being', 'staple', 'Nick', 'Night', 'several', 'years', 'What', 'interesting', 'how', 'characters', 'become', 'more', 'fleshed-out', 'series', 'progressed', 'Mary', 'become', 'less', 'shy', 'Ted', 'usually', 'inept', 'anchorman', 'smarter', 'think', 'one', 'character', 'whole', 'series', 'Lou', 'Grant', 'who', 'still', 'authoritative', 'figure', 'quickly', 'Ted', 'behavior.The', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'show', 'addressed', 'issues', 'were', 'rarely', 'touched', 'Network', 'Television', 'exception', 'course', 'All', 'Family', 'However', 'other', 'sitcoms', 'characters', 'show', 'displayed', 'genuine', 'affection', 'other', 'even', 'sympathize', 'Ted', 'heart', 'attack', 'episode', 'Ted', 'change', 'heart', 'Only', 'show', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'could', 'successfully', 'pull', 'off', 'characters', 'where', 'so', 'well', 'developed.In', 'many', 'ways', 'last', 'few', 'seasons', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'was', 'precursor', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'sitcoms', 'Taxi', 'Cheers', 'shows', 'had', 'many', 'same', 'elements', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'show', 'treated', 'risqu', 'eacute', 'subject', 'matters', 'degree', 'sophistication.I', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'happy', 'way', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'show', 'ended', 'guess', 'producers', 'were', 'trying', 'be', 'ironic', 'having', 'Ted', 'only', 'member', 'show', 'not', 'fired', 'bad', 'ratings', 'reason', 'ending', 'was', 'touching', 'got', 'know', 'characters', 'so', 'well', 'seeing', 'then', 'leave', 'was', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'old', 'friend']",N/A

1367908,A1TK34JJU7877X,B003VTKZ84,Brian F. Sebesta,"[9, 10]","The Mary Tyler Moore Show: The Complete Seventh SeasonFirst I will say 2 positive things, the shows look wonderfully crisp and clear as the others did and Kudos for restoring the lost curtain call at the end of the final episode, it is a short sequence but it completely reveals in that 40 seconds or so how much the audience loved this cast and how much they loved and cared for each other! I had to have it to finish out the set, but I need to get a few things off of my chest.Now for the negative stuff!The first season of this classic series was released by fox video, (it's no mistake, they don't deserve their name in caps),on dvd in September 2002 and I ran to the store as soon as I had money to make my purchase. I was more than a fan of the show, I was hypnotized by the show as much as with other classics like ""I Love Lucy"" and many other favorites when growing up. I was sure by the elegant packaging and a few extra's that obviously created & collected just for the DVD release that there were more goodies in store for the release of the next 6 sets. BOY WAS I EVER WRONG. Season 1 was the first and last of any creativity, extra content and any consideration at ALL for what fox video had in store for the rest of the series, and quite frankly was a complete and utter disrespect not only for the people shelling out their hard earned dollars but also a violent slap in the face to the creators and extremely talented cast of this classic show! The following seasons not only had zero extra features, but season by season make the packaging cheaper and cheaper to the point where many of the last sets didn't even have the titles of the show printed on the cover much less a booklet inside with episodic information.Speaking to the show's themselves, well at least all of the shows have been taken from the original prints and shown mostly uncut and in their original form. I say for ""mostly uncut"" because even as early as the first season's 'ChristmaS & The Hard Luck Kid' Fox was so cheap and cut one of the best sequences in any of the episodes when Mary who has volunteered to work on Christmas Eve begins to dance and sing to music on the television. The singing and music is edited because of some sort of cheapskate executive at fox who decided that he/she did not want to pay royalties on the song, and butchered a great episode. It was also done on several other episodes including this 7th season disc in the dream sequence where Ted & Mary are on their honeymoon in ""Mary's Three Husbands"".I completely understand trying to cut corners to make the product affordable for all, but come on fox! You dangle a 18 karat gold diamond pendant necklace in front of us as an example of what we are going to see in the future, then end up making only a dollar store piece of costume jewelry available for purchase for the next 6 seasons and drag it out over 8 years! YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED!fox doesn't deserve our money but as most fans, they know we will buy it because we love Mary, Valerie, Cloris, Ed, Gavin, Georgia, Ted & Betty!Brian SebestaBiggest MTM FAN!",2,"The set is complete, FINALLY!",1290297600,"11 21, 2010",2010,3080,"['Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'Complete', 'Seventh', 'SeasonFirst', 'will', 'say', '2', 'positive', 'things', 'shows', 'look', 'wonderfully', 'crisp', 'clear', 'others', 'did', 'Kudos', 'restoring', 'lost', 'curtain', 'call', 'end', 'final', 'episode', 'short', 'sequence', 'completely', '40', 'seconds', 'so', 'how', 'much', 'audience', 'loved', 'cast', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'cared', 'other', 'had', 'have', 'finish', 'out', 'set', 'need', 'get', 'few', 'things', 'chest.Now', 'negative', 'stuff', 'first', 'season', 'classic', 'series', 'was', 'released', 'fox', 'video', 'mistake', 'do', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'name', 'caps', 'dvd', 'September', '2002', 'ran', 'store', 'as', 'soon', 'had', 'money', 'make', 'purchase', 'was', 'more', 'fan', 'show', 'was', 'hypnotized', 'show', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'classics', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'many', 'other', 'favorites', 'when', 'growing', 'up', 'was', 'sure', 'elegant', 'packaging', 'few', 'extra', 'obviously', 'created', 'collected', 'just', 'DVD', 'release', 'were', 'more', 'goodies', 'store', 'release', 'next', '6', 'sets', 'BOY', 'WAS', 'EVER', 'WRONG', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'first', 'last', 'creativity', 'extra', 'content', 'consideration', 'ALL', 'what', 'fox', 'video', 'had', 'store', 'rest', 'series', 'quite', 'frankly', 'was', 'complete', 'utter', 'disrespect', 'not', 'only', 'people', 'shelling', 'out', 'hard', 'earned', 'dollars', 'also', 'violent', 'slap', 'face', 'creators', 'extremely', 'talented', 'cast', 'classic', 'show', 'following', 'seasons', 'not', 'only', 'had', 'zero', 'extra', 'features', 'season', 'season', 'make', 'packaging', 'cheaper', 'cheaper', 'point', 'where', 'many', 'last', 'sets', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'titles', 'show', 'printed', 'cover', 'much', 'less', 'booklet', 'episodic', 'information.Speaking', 'show', 'well', 'least', 'shows', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'original', 'prints', 'shown', 'mostly', 'uncut', 'original', 'form', 'say', 'mostly', 'uncut', 'because', 'even', 'as', 'early', 'first', 'season', ""'ChristmaS"", 'Hard', 'Luck', 'Kid', 'Fox', 'was', 'so', 'cheap', 'cut', 'one', 'best', 'sequences', 'episodes', 'when', 'Mary', 'who', 'volunteered', 'work', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'dance', 'sing', 'music', 'television', 'singing', 'music', 'edited', 'sort', 'cheapskate', 'executive', 'fox', 'who', 'decided', 'he/she', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'pay', 'royalties', 'song', 'butchered', 'great', 'episode', 'was', 'also', 'done', 'several', 'other', 'episodes', 'including', '7th', 'season', 'disc', 'dream', 'sequence', 'where', 'Ted', 'Mary', 'are', 'honeymoon', 'Mary', 'Three', 'Husbands', '.I', 'completely', 'understand', 'trying', 'cut', 'corners', 'make', 'product', 'affordable', 'come', 'fox', 'dangle', '18', 'karat', 'gold', 'diamond', 'pendant', 'necklace', 'front', 'example', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'future', 'then', 'end', 'up', 'making', 'only', 'dollar', 'store', 'piece', 'costume', 'jewelry', 'available', 'purchase', 'next', '6', 'seasons', 'drag', 'out', '8', 'years', 'YOU', 'SHOULD', 'BE', 'ASHAMED', 'fox', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'money', 'most', 'fans', 'know', 'will', 'buy', 'love', 'Mary', 'Valerie', 'Cloris', 'Ed', 'Gavin', 'Georgia', 'Ted', 'Betty', 'Brian', 'SebestaBiggest', 'MTM', 'FAN']",N/A

Sadly, it had to come in the form of schizo releases from Fox, but at least we have it.Season 7 continues the bare bones presentation of the last few seasons.  The three DVDs are in one regular sized DVD case with no insert, but at least the cover is printed on both sides this time and the case is clear so that an episode list can be printed on the left-hand side.  No episode synopsis mind you, just an episode list, but it's more than Fox could be bothered with in the past.  No bonus features are included.The shows themselves look great on DVD and season 7 ends the series on a very high note with a number of classic episodes beyond the obvious last episode.  Unfortunately, even though the back of the DVD case proudly states the special Final Curtain Call ending is included on ""The Last Show,"" it's nowhere to be found.  Evil Fox strikes again.[BEGIN EDIT]Thankfully calling the toll free Fox number was painless and within a week I received a replacement Disc 3 that includes the advertised Final Curtain Call on ""The Last Show."" Kudos to Fox for quickly addressing the issue and correcting it.  Hopefully this error won't occur in future pressings and Fox will continue to replace discs as necessary.[END EDIT]So this is The Mary Tyler Moore Show on DVD.  All the warts and waiting caused by Fox still can't dim the effervescent joy of the show.  This is timeless television that deserves to be seen for years to come.

I know this for a fact because I bought the set myself from Amazon a week and a half ago, fully expecting to receive the defective version. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to find ""The Last Show"" totally intact, with MTM herself, coming onstage afterward to bring out the entire cast, including Cloris Leachman and Valerie Harper, for one final bow. All the while, the closing credits are rolling, in effect, replacing the traditional theme music.Its impossible to know if you have the corrected version, just by looking at the outer case. Older, faulty versions are being sold side by side with newly minted ones. If you want to be sure of getting the correct one (And who doesn't?), my best advice would be to wait an undetermined amount of time until you are certain that the new old stock has cleared the shelves, and then buy, all the while, keeping your fingers crossed!And if you still get a defective version, my contacts have told me that COMPLETE disk 3s are only a phone call away.

The disc was in perfectcondition and played and viwed perfectly.I received an email from customer support in November saying that the Company was trying to resolve this usse for international orders/customers ... and although this was polite and encouraging I did not hold out much hope, and actually forgot about it.

You get the feeling that the decision not to renew the series was made during mid season, given the impending doom that fell over the show.  First, we see Sue Ann's show given the axe with her forced into a series of menial positions until Mary finally relents and hires her on the news show.  Then Mary and Lou ponder quitting when the new CEO, played by David Ogden Stiers refused to give them the raise they demand, only to relent in the end.  And, finally, the curtain falls when WJM is bought out, leading to the fateful climax for a show that ran seven wonderful seasons.You could see the strain starting develop back in season five, when Rhoda left to start her ownshowunder the MTM bannerhead.  Then Phyllis departed, reducing the cast to the corps at WJM.  There were some fun episodes with Sue Ann and Ted, but their limited personae only allowed so much room to grow, even when Ted finally decided to marry Georgette and have a child.  Two in fact, with the second coming in a very amusing birth scene in Mary's apartment.The final season got a bit preachy and too nostalgic, with episodes that tended to look back, not forward, as the show had always done.  Lou seemed tired, as if the writers had managed to squeeze all they could out of his character, and Mary seemed to be looking toward 40 like a curse, with a number of jokes directed at her inability to find a man before it was too late.  The return of John Amos as a successful New York anchorman was a lot of fun, as he ribbed Ted unmercifully.  But, ultimately Ted gets the last laugh, as he finds himself the only one to remain of the news crew after the purges are made, resulting in a scene that moves uneasily between humor and pathos before the lights are put out for good.Mary went on to do many great things and inspire a whole new era of television women, not least of all Tina Fey, who credits this show as the inspiration for30 Rock.  Lou went from television newsroom to the news desk of an LA newspaper inLou Grantand Gavin McLeod and Ted Knight battled for captain ofThe Love Boatwith McLeod winning out.",4,'Tis a sad farewell,1291852800,"12 9, 2010",2010,2125,"['final', 'season', 'was', 'bumpy', 'ride', 'get', 'feeling', 'decision', 'not', 'renew', 'series', 'was', 'made', 'mid', 'season', 'given', 'impending', 'doom', 'fell', 'show', 'First', 'see', 'Sue', 'Ann', 'show', 'given', 'axe', 'forced', 'series', 'menial', 'positions', 'Mary', 'finally', 'relents', 'news', 'show', 'Then', 'Mary', 'Lou', 'ponder', 'quitting', 'when', 'new', 'CEO', 'played', 'David', 'Ogden', 'Stiers', 'refused', 'give', 'raise', 'demand', 'only', 'relent', 'end', 'finally', 'curtain', 'when', 'WJM', 'bought', 'out', 'leading', 'fateful', 'climax', 'show', 'ran', 'seven', 'wonderful', 'seasons.You', 'could', 'see', 'strain', 'starting', 'develop', 'back', 'season', 'five', 'when', 'Rhoda', 'left', 'start', 'ownshowunder', 'MTM', 'bannerhead', 'Then', 'Phyllis', 'departed', 'reducing', 'cast', 'corps', 'WJM', 'were', 'fun', 'episodes', 'Sue', 'Ann', 'Ted', 'limited', 'personae', 'only', 'allowed', 'so', 'much', 'room', 'grow', 'even', 'when', 'Ted', 'finally', 'decided', 'marry', 'Georgette', 'have', 'child', 'Two', 'fact', 'second', 'coming', 'very', 'amusing', 'birth', 'scene', 'Mary', 'apartment.The', 'final', 'season', 'got', 'bit', 'preachy', 'too', 'nostalgic', 'episodes', 'tended', 'look', 'back', 'not', 'forward', 'show', 'had', 'always', 'done', 'Lou', 'seemed', 'tired', 'writers', 'had', 'managed', 'squeeze', 'could', 'out', 'character', 'Mary', 'seemed', 'be', 'looking', '40', 'curse', 'number', 'jokes', 'directed', 'inability', 'find', 'man', 'was', 'too', 'late', 'return', 'John', 'Amos', 'successful', 'New', 'York', 'anchorman', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'ribbed', 'Ted', 'unmercifully', 'ultimately', 'Ted', 'last', 'laugh', 'only', 'one', 'remain', 'news', 'crew', 'purges', 'are', 'made', 'resulting', 'scene', 'uneasily', 'humor', 'pathos', 'lights', 'are', 'put', 'out', 'good.Mary', 'went', 'do', 'many', 'great', 'things', 'inspire', 'whole', 'new', 'era', 'television', 'women', 'not', 'least', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'who', 'show', 'inspiration', 'for30', 'Rock', 'Lou', 'went', 'television', 'newsroom', 'news', 'desk', 'LA', 'newspaper', 'inLou', 'Grantand', 'Gavin', 'McLeod', 'Ted', 'Knight', 'battled', 'captain', 'ofThe', 'Love', 'Boatwith', 'McLeod', 'winning', 'out']",N/A

In the beginning of the series I admit he was funny, but the writers wrote so much of Ted, and Lou putting up with his absurd role as a news commentator, it made no sense, and got very boring and silly instead of funny. I got so fed up with his role, I fast forwarded shows that were filled with Ted. The show where his fellow workers wanted him to return from his vacation after the way he acted and treated everybody made no sense. He was a selfish idiotic liar, not a friend of anybody but himself.  Soon, I thought it should have been renamed the Ted Baxter show. He had more roles than anyone in the cast.Season 5 was filled with Baxter, and I hope the last 2 are not.  Anyway, after Rhoda left the show, it was never the same. Rhoda, Phillis and Mary together were my favorites. All 3 very good actors.  I think because they didn't overdo it, and because they were so good together was one reason their scenes always worked. Lou was always great too.  I guess he held the show together, but the writers who let Lou keep Ted on the news, giving him raises after raises after his ridiculous performances on the news made no sense at all.  Then to top it off he puts hard working Mary on suspension after one silly little mistake, when Ted made worse mistakes night after night.  That never made a bit of sense to me.  But then I guess some people think comedy is not supposed to make sense.  I disagree.",3,I hope they cut down on Baxter,1282694400,"08 25, 2010",2010,1533,"['most', 'viewers', 'here', 'loved', 'MTM', 'was', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'role', 'Ted', 'Baxter', 'fact', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'beginning', 'series', 'admit', 'was', 'funny', 'writers', 'wrote', 'so', 'much', 'Ted', 'Lou', 'putting', 'up', 'absurd', 'role', 'news', 'commentator', 'made', 'sense', 'got', 'very', 'boring', 'silly', 'instead', 'funny', 'got', 'so', 'fed', 'up', 'role', 'fast', 'forwarded', 'shows', 'were', 'filled', 'Ted', 'show', 'where', 'fellow', 'workers', 'wanted', 'return', 'vacation', 'way', 'acted', 'treated', 'everybody', 'made', 'sense', 'was', 'selfish', 'idiotic', 'liar', 'not', 'friend', 'anybody', 'Soon', 'thought', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'renamed', 'Ted', 'Baxter', 'show', 'had', 'more', 'roles', 'anyone', 'cast.Season', '5', 'was', 'filled', 'Baxter', 'hope', 'last', '2', 'are', 'not', 'Anyway', 'Rhoda', 'left', 'show', 'was', 'never', 'same', 'Rhoda', 'Phillis', 'Mary', 'together', 'were', 'favorites', '3', 'very', 'good', 'actors', 'think', 'did', ""n't"", 'overdo', 'were', 'so', 'good', 'together', 'was', 'one', 'reason', 'scenes', 'always', 'worked', 'Lou', 'was', 'always', 'great', 'too', 'guess', 'held', 'show', 'together', 'writers', 'who', 'let', 'Lou', 'keep', 'Ted', 'news', 'giving', 'raises', 'ridiculous', 'performances', 'news', 'made', 'sense', 'Then', 'top', 'off', 'hard', 'working', 'Mary', 'suspension', 'one', 'silly', 'little', 'mistake', 'when', 'Ted', 'made', 'worse', 'mistakes', 'night', 'night', 'never', 'made', 'bit', 'sense', 'then', 'guess', 'people', 'think', 'comedy', 'not', 'supposed', 'make', 'sense', 'disagree']",N/A

1367954,A3BZSYJKZCRY03,B003VTKZ84,Retro Pixie,"[5, 5]","One more season.  One more time to experience plucky Mary's nervous chatter, but also her strength, success and independence.  Once more for Lou Grant's gruff exterior coupled with a warm heart.  One more time for Murray's creative soul to win a TEDDY, for Ted to botch the news, for Sue Ann to flash her devilish smile sprinkled with sugar and dimples and for Georgette to charm us with her whimsy.  ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" cast and crew clearly got together for their final season and said...Once more... with feeling.And with that, MTM, Ed Asner, Gavin MacLeod, Ted Knight, Betty White and Georgia Engel gave us a wonderful season filled with a lot of laughs and some tears, too.  Mary Tyler Moore knew exactly what she was doing when she decided to end the series with the seventh season.  With great performances and scripts, they went out on top.  Go out on top and leave them wanting more.  That they did.Some standouts from the 1976/77 season:  ""Sue Ann's Sister"" is worth the price just to watch the gang from WJM ending up in Sue Ann's romance-novel bedroom as she has a meltdown on her vibrating bed.  ""Mary's Insomnia"" is a classic.  Mary can't sleep, so her doctor prescribes sleeping pills; this has Mr. Grant spouting off hilarious comments about pushers & drugs.  MTM has yet another scene that proves how tremendous she is; watching her in a completely silent couple of minutes as she struggles not to take her pill is both funny and mesmerizing.  ""Mary's Big Party"" flashes back to a few of her infamous parties, but features a very funny current party where Johnny Carson makes an appearance...sort of.  My favorite of this season is ""Murray Can't Lose,"" where Murray is told he is going to win the TEDDY.  Murray's `acceptance speech' at the end is particularly sentimental, since we all knew the show was ending soon.  In addition, one of the funniest scenes in the entire series is in this episode as Mary, hoping she's good enough to perform at the awards, sings ""One for My Baby"" in Mr. Grant's office.  I don't know what is funnier in this scene - her performance or his reaction.  Georgette ends up in a shining performance at the awards, dancing and singing ""Steam Heat.""  How appropriate.  When most series were running out of steam, this show left us with...steam heat.And now a confession from a Mary geek:  I can't watch the final show.  I've seen it once; it makes me cry.  I didn't want it to end with such uncertainty and would rather have them all together still working in the newsroom and let that be my everlasting memory.  It's one of the very few things I would have changed about the series.There are 24 episodes in these high quality discs,and the final curtain call is included.  No extras, but as I've pointed out before, there are a multitude of extras in the first two seasons.

It's been a pretty negative experience, though, for two main reasons:  technically, this season is very poorly made; and in the script department, this season's episodes are simply lame.We immediately noticed a difference in the theme song quality--it sounds simply awful.  Unfortunately, so does a lot of the dialogue and a lot of the other sounds.  Everything sounds cheap, for lack of a better word.  Add to that the fact that the first two discs always took forever just to load--sometimes seven or eight tries--and you have enough for a frustrating experience.What's worse, though, are the scripts.  We still love the characters, but this season they all seem to jump out of character so often that it gets truly annoying.  Many times in this season, my wife has turned to me and said, ""Lou would never say anything like that,"" or, ""Why is Murray doing that?  That's not in character.""  And the jokes are almost all telegraphed with a set-up and then a punchline--there's very little of the spontaneity that made season six so enjoyable.  There are too many stock characters introduced, too many moments that make no sense, too many completely stupid lines for this to be considered a great season.Mary is really good this year.  Ted is better than he has been.  Betty White is always in form.  Ed Asner is good, but Lou Grant is a different character every episode.  All in all, it's just a very uneven season of scripts.  It does pick up a bit for a few episodes at the end of disc two, but that's a lot of watching to get to the good stuff.Season six was wonderful, as the show hit its apex.  In season seven, though, they seemed to have started a steady roll downhill.

The show found a home on DVD in the early 2000's, but after the release of the first four years the studio stopped releasing season sets. Finally, in 2009 season five arrived on DVD and this year the last two seasons have made their way into store shelves.The final year of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" was extraordinary; Ted becomes a dad with Georgette, Mary and Lou share a dinner date, and most wonderful was the series' final episode entitled simply ""The Last Show"". That one episode is highly regarded by most TV critics as one of the best series finales in broadcast history. That episode also won an Emmy for ""Best Writing For a Comedy"". The gem in this DVD set is a ""curtain call"" that was originally part of the last episode that featured Mary Tyler Moore introducing her cast members at the end of the finale as ""the best ever"" to the studio and home audience. That ""curtain call"" was subsequently cut from all syndicated airings and will be available here for the first time in over 33 years!This set includes all 24 season seven episodes on three discs.The final year of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" finished at #39 in the all-important Nielsen Ratings. That ranking is perhaps the main reason the show went off the air despite what some say.The following is a list of season 7 episodes:1. Mary Midwife2. Mary the Writer3. Sue Ann's Sister4.

I am glad I have them all anyways, whether is plastic or cardboard or is it paper or plastic? ...Thank You D.D.",5,~ AT LAST MY COLLECTION IS COMPLETE!!,1324512000,"12 22, 2011",2011,1671,"['Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'Complete', 'Seventh', 'Season', 'waited', 'time', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'problems', 'missing', 'parts', 'were', 'taking', 'care', 'finally', 'ordered', 'got', 'last', 'Season', 'Seven', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'Final', 'Curtain', 'Call', 'was', 'thought', 'was', 'name', 'last', 'Episode', 'back', 'DVD', 'box', '3', 'Disc', 'set', '24', 'season', 'seven', 'episodes', 'including', 'Final', 'Curtain', 'Call', 'Last', 'Show', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'one', 'was', 'very', 'first', 'Episode', 'watched', 'so', 'now', 'know', 'what', 'characters', 'come', 'audience', 'take', 'final', 'last', 'Bow', 'screen', 'credits', 'are', 'rolling', 'up', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'emotional', 'was', 'time', 'season', 'seven', 'full', 'very', 'funny', 'Episodes', 'everyone', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'Ted', 'even', 'funnier', 'last', 'Season', 'bunch', 'characters', 'keeps', 'laughing', 'hours', 'should', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'sooner.My', 'cheap', 'Plastic', 'Box', 'DVDs', 'was', 'smashed', 'one', 'corner', 'was', 'put', 'final', 'cardboard', 'box', 'delivery', 'how', 'found', 'outside', 'carton', 'box', 'had', 'damage', 'however', '3', 'Dvds', 'are', 'perfect', 'shape', 'not', 'even', 'finger', 'print', 'took', 'many', 'years', 'finally', 'complete', 'entire', 'collection', 'have', 'now', 'can', 'see', 'first', '4', 'years', 'season', 'came', 'beautiful', 'BoxEach', 'Box', 'containing', '3', 'beautiful', 'black', 'sleeves', 'DVDs', 'kinds', 'information', 'separate', 'sleeve', 'Episodes', 'listed', 'back', 'Airdate', 'small', 'Synopsis', 'show', 'quite', 'difference', 'last', 'three', 'years', 'am', 'glad', 'have', 'anyways', 'plastic', 'cardboard', 'paper', 'plastic', 'Thank', 'D.D']",N/A
