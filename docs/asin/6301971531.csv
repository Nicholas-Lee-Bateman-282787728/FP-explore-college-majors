I don't understand the review discussing the ""perplexing pas de deux"" issue.  When I was 7 years old I don't recall sensing anything sinister or improper about Uncle Drosselmeier's behavior towards Clara.  The narrator explains at the beginning of the story that Drosselmeier is giving his godchild ""the gift of a dream.""Sigh!  I suppose next some enterprising critic will suggest that the entire premise of ""The Nutcracker"" is socially/sexually deviant because the love match involves a young girl and a toy, that the Nutcracker/Prince endorses an unhealthy female dependence on ""Prince Charming"" complex, and that the battle with the mice indicates a rodent fetish.The storyline has to be taken in context with the era in which it was originally conceived.  It is the story of a young girl nearing adulthood and the complexities of adult choices such as finding a life partner.  Drosselmeier's interferences at the end were meant to draw Clara free from the fantasy/dream and keep her from being ""lost"" in it.  Surely no one here thinks a responsible parent/guardian would simply allow an adolescent girl to run away with the first beau she falls in love with?The themes of the dances also indicate Clara's more childish side longing to be ""more grown up"".  She is dreaming about sweets and flowers (traditional courting gifts at the time as well as the present.) Her costume change (from girl's nightgown to evening dress and crown) indicate a sort of temporary maturity for the sake of the dream.  In the end she returns to her nightgown.My perception of this production has changed throughout the years and I analyze it much more deeply as an adult than I did when I was a child.  At no time did I ever perceive Drosselmeier as a pedophile or even a sinister character.Most artistic interpretation relies upon whatever the viewer's perception of the art form is.  I perceive it as a coming-of-age story, the prequel of a young Victorian miss longing but still not quite ready to wear grown-up gowns and receive gentlemen callers, etc.I've read criticism of the ballet's production values.  It is still beautifully, lovingly done given its age and I appreciate the simplicity of the sets because they don't overwhelm the principles.This is a precious children's faerie tale with some of the best artistic talent (both dance and music) of its time.  It should be savored lovingly with hot chocolate and friends and family, particularly young people.",5,An enduring classic,1134777600,"12 17, 2005",2005,2500,"['have', 'grown', 'up', 'Baryshnikov', 'Nutcracker', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'review', 'discussing', 'perplexing', 'pas', 'de', 'deux', 'issue', 'When', 'was', '7', 'years', 'old', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'sensing', 'anything', 'sinister', 'improper', 'Uncle', 'Drosselmeier', 'behavior', 'towards', 'Clara', 'narrator', 'beginning', 'story', 'Drosselmeier', 'giving', 'godchild', 'gift', 'dream.', 'Sigh', 'suppose', 'next', 'enterprising', 'critic', 'will', 'suggest', 'entire', 'premise', 'Nutcracker', 'socially/sexually', 'deviant', 'love', 'match', 'young', 'girl', 'toy', 'Nutcracker/Prince', 'unhealthy', 'female', 'dependence', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'complex', 'battle', 'mice', 'rodent', 'fetish.The', 'storyline', 'be', 'taken', 'context', 'era', 'was', 'originally', 'conceived', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'nearing', 'adulthood', 'complexities', 'adult', 'choices', 'such', 'finding', 'life', 'partner', 'Drosselmeier', 'interferences', 'end', 'were', 'meant', 'draw', 'Clara', 'free', 'fantasy/dream', 'keep', 'being', 'lost', 'Surely', 'one', 'here', 'responsible', 'parent/guardian', 'would', 'simply', 'allow', 'adolescent', 'girl', 'run', 'away', 'first', 'beau', 'love', 'themes', 'dances', 'also', 'indicate', 'Clara', 'more', 'childish', 'side', 'longing', 'be', 'more', 'grown', 'up', 'dreaming', 'sweets', 'flowers', 'traditional', 'courting', 'gifts', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'present', 'costume', 'change', 'girl', 'nightgown', 'evening', 'dress', 'crown', 'indicate', 'sort', 'temporary', 'maturity', 'sake', 'dream', 'end', 'nightgown.My', 'perception', 'production', 'changed', 'years', 'analyze', 'much', 'more', 'deeply', 'adult', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'time', 'did', 'ever', 'perceive', 'Drosselmeier', 'pedophile', 'even', 'sinister', 'character.Most', 'artistic', 'interpretation', 'relies', 'viewer', 'perception', 'art', 'form', 'perceive', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'prequel', 'young', 'Victorian', 'miss', 'longing', 'still', 'not', 'quite', 'ready', 'wear', 'grown-up', 'gowns', 'receive', 'gentlemen', 'callers', 'etc.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'criticism', 'ballet', 'production', 'values', 'still', 'beautifully', 'lovingly', 'done', 'given', 'age', 'appreciate', 'simplicity', 'sets', 'do', ""n't"", 'overwhelm', 'principles.This', 'precious', 'children', 'faerie', 'tale', 'best', 'artistic', 'talent', 'dance', 'music', 'time', 'should', 'be', 'savored', 'lovingly', 'hot', 'chocolate', 'friends', 'family', 'particularly', 'young', 'people']",The Nutcracker The American Ballet Theatre  VHS

The American Ballet Theatre, starring Mikhail Baryshnikov in the title role, a charming young woman named Gelsey Kirkland as Clara, and an imperious Uncle Drosselmeyer played by Alexander Minz.The sets, the costumes, and of course the exquisite music of Tchaikovsky all work superbly in this production. I don't know enough about ballet to know whether all the fine little touches are traditional, but there's humor, a lot of latent sexuality (Baryshnikov can't help it), and no trouble at all following the story. Since this is film, it is possible to take different camera angles and see the dancers close up at times, something that wouldn't work very well in a live theater. Well, perhaps with a good pair of opera glasses you could see more detail, but quite a few of the special effects would presumably be a lot more artificial on stage. For example, the very real-looking snow storm that introduces the dance of the snowflakes.By the way, the Chinese dancers are adorable, but they're not mushrooms.",5,Took My Breath Away!

They see it: the costumes, the puppets, the snowflakes that Misha envisioned, and they say &quot;Wow! I didn't know it was like that!&quot; Certainly, it is. Between this and Pacific Northwest Ballet's version, it's a toss-up about which choreography is better in terms of story, phrasing, clarity, and line. There is a distinct Russian flavor, particularly in the Waltz of the Snowflakes, which looks like it was lifted from the Kirov of Misha's early career.  There are some jarring camera angles in this version that cut dancers seemingly in half, but really, I'm nitpicking. Gelsey's Clara in ACT I is what this ballet should be: pure dancing and mime in the context of a child's experience. What might be going on around her is just acting, but Gelsey (much to her credit) always searched for truth. It comes through the character of Clara quite nicely. And Misha? Watch him and gasp--his solo variations are breathtaking. I would have liked to see the Indian variation and less spotty camera-work, but who cares? Overall, this is a pastel dream.

282405,ASKUZHOKQ1W3E,6301971531,"Dane R. Youssef ""surfur""","[3, 4]","by Dane YoussefPerhaps the best interpretation of ""The Nutcracker"" ever made. Baryshnikov's finest hour. And as even the most ballet-ignorant know, that barre' is set pretty high.I have seen Mikhail Baryshnikov dance in the much-praised chick-flick ""The Turning Point."" And I have seen him dance his own interpretation of ""Don Quixote."" Good. Great, even. But not as much as fellow Russkie ballerino Nureyev's stab at ""Quixote."" And I have seen much more of him dancing. The man defies gravity, as well as many other laws. A ballet dancer, in the country of America, has been treated like a movie star. But this may very well be his best work, artistic-wise.Mikhail Baryshnikov is man who hardly needs an introduction, as he is a man who is synonymous with ballet. The man is a household name, Baryshnikov is at his best here, which is more than difficult, even for him. Celebrated USA ballerina Gelsey Kirkland (who was a regular partner and even girlfriend of dear Misha at the time) actually proves to be a credible match. And even takes it to a higher level than he does in HER solo scenes.This was the first ""Nutcracker"" I've ever seen. I have seen several interpretations of ""The Nutcracker"" since then, and this one still stands as the best of the lot. There are no real children in this cast. The children's roles are played by adults in adolescent-looking wigs.The idea to make this a movie rather than a live stage piece kind of works. It allows for more visual effects than a straight live piece would have.There is a moment where Ms. Kirkland dances a solo all by herself, that sequence actually left be breathless. When she shakes her pointed feet like bells, the music jingles in pitch-perfect sync. She doesn't seem to be following the music at all. The music seems to be following her.It's so beautifully and perfectly done, that as someone who takes ballet and has danced on the stage, that it actually hurt to watch.The day that I can move as gracefully and exquisitely (on her worst day, I mean) may never come. Kirkland actually, in that one scene, manages to steal the movie away from Baryshnikov. Baryshnikov's leaps, turns, jumps and pirouettes are as breathtaking as always, and somehow never seem to get old. Misha's striking presence and Peter Pan-like mobility just.. well, makes you want to get up and dance. Or just jump around. He doesn't so much leap as much as soars.Baryshnikov puts some little touches of humor here and there. There's a lovable old man at the Christmas Party who attempts to dance and hurts himself, as well as a toy soldier who stubs his toe. Baryshnikov has always seemingly had the soul of a child and the heart of a clown.The Arabian Coffee Dance has been deleted for running time, I'm sorry to say. As has Mother Gigogne. Not to mention The famed ""Waltz Of The Snowflakes"" is a powerhouse, the ballet corps sway to the music so beautifully, for the briefest moment, we actually forget about Baryshnikov and Kirkland.Is Baryshnikov trying to give himself more screen time, Clara or the ballet itself? Alexander Minz proves to be invaluable as a supporting player in the role of Drosselmyer. I was reminded of Fred Astaire. He moves around with his long, willowy limbs in a way that seemed almost inhuman. I seriously doubt ever got half the credit he deserved throughout his life.He had an effective, amusing cameo in ""The Turning Point."" Baryshnikov continues to prove time and time again what we already know--the greatest ballet dancer of any generation will always be a Russian.The choreography is riveting, some of the best I've ever seen. Although, the honor for ""World's Greatest"" go to ""Singin' In The Rain."" Maybe the Russian could put dances together now. He's reportedly a great teacher of dance as well.While many of the special-effects look a bit outdated, it remains a riveting experience. After all, most ballet movies are just filmed dancing and this one takes the effort to actually be something of a movie.The acting is not much, nor is there as much plot as is traditional, a as this ""Nutcracker"" focuses more on the dancing and music. The pyrotechnics (the dancer's rapidly-moving muscular limbs and the way they and the music truly gel).Despite Mr. Baryshnikov in the title role and given prominent first billing, the star of ""The Nutcracker"" is Gelsey Kirkland as Clara, as this is all Clara's story.Mnay movies have attempted to translate this legendary dance story to the screen, usually with disastrous results. For example, the mistake the 20th Century Fox movie ""George Balanchine's The Nutcracker"" made was if they were going to made the ballet into a movie, they should have done something for the movie that they couldn't do for a live production. Alas, they did not. It moved so slowly and the whole movie was so badly-lit, it looked like somebody boot-legged the whole thing with a camcorder.The solo duets are just as enjoyable. The dancers, are in fact, so good that they almost threaten to outdo the leads.It's a beautiful story, more with flair and style in it's depth. It's a revised fairy tale.When Misha and Gels prance together, their body movements almost in perfect parallel... it's beautiful and breath-taking. They seem to be connected internally somehow. These are two people... brought together by dance. It's every little girl's dream... and that's exactly what the ""Nutcracker"" should be.by Dane Youssef[...].[...].",4,"Of all the ""Nutcrackers,"" this shines brightest... like a star... like the

282406,A2EOD5RENQG59D,6301971531,Danielle Bennignus,"[17, 17]","Despite it's missing some important bits from the original, I am compelled to embrace this Nutcracker as my favorite - I watch it throughout the year, not just at Christmas time.The casting is perfect, with Mikhail Baryshnikov and Gelsey Kirkland taking the lead.  Alexander Minz is perfect as Drosselmeyer, and the ABT company members portray the peripheral roles with skill and elan.  Particular variations that stand out to my mind are that of Columbine and Harlequin, the Spanish dancers, and Dance of the Mirlitons.  Why they left out the Arabian variation, I'll never know...but that doesn't ruin the viewing experience.I actually prefer this plot to that involving the Sugarplum Fairy - this, which I believe follows closer to the traditional Russian storyline, focuses moreso on the dream of Clara, and her adolescent awakening. Rather than planting her on a pillow (to stay from then on) upon her arrival in the Land of the Sweets, she remains involved, dancing a yearning pas de deux with the Nutcracker Prince.  It makes the ballet far more interesting, and not such a little girls' fantasy (which can get a bit mawkish after a short while).

Criticism of the production quality for its blue cast is correct - it's not nearly so colorful as, for example, the very recent San Francisco version.  But what makes it magical is that these are not ballet stars showing their abilities.  Baryshnikov and Kirkland and Minz ARE the Nutcracker/prince, Clara and Drosselmeyer.  All the other performances I've watched are beautiful (save one) but the story seems to get lost in the dancing.  Kirkland is beautiful, sad, excited, enchanting and vulnerable.  Her dancing is effortless and she obviously is completely in character.  Minz is Drosselmeyer - there can be no other like him.  Baryshnikov sometimes seems a little over the top but the chemistry between him and Kirkland pulls him back every time.  The choreography perfectly fits the music which perfectly fits the choreography.  The end is perfect with Clara not wanting to wake and looking through the window like a little girl wishing.All of that removes the blue cast for me and makes this performance one I look forward to every year.  It IS a dream, after all and dreams like this one usually are softly focused.  The performance invites you to join the dream.But, as with strawberries and blueberries - it shouldn't be watched out of season or it will become ordinary.

For those of us who watched them on stage, it was a magical partnership even if at the time we did not know its tragic undertones.  Other than an occassional outing with Makarova, Baryshnikov was never as evenly or stimulatingly matched.  Pity there is no record of their Giselle or La Sylphide or Gelsey's ""The Leaves are Fading"".  Both artists were at their peak when they danced together, and their peak to this day remains of the highest order. So, we are lucky that some record exists.Unfortunately, one wishes this were a better document.  This is a studio performance, and at times looks rather cramped. For some reason, even on DVD, everything seems taped in soft-focus, with a bluish gauzy overlay that becomes irritating.  The choreography is thoroughly undistinguished if not boring. As noted elsewhere, the Arabian Dance is missing. It's fun to spot some ABT regulars of the period such as Warren Conover and George de la Pena, even if they don't do much.  But this Nutcracker has been re-conceived to be Gelsey's and Misha's show, and, limited a show as it may be, they are the only reasons to purchase this DVD, if at all.

282419,A2D3H2F628I0HD,6301971531,Itsoutthere,"[1, 1]","I grew up with a recorded VHS broadcast of this ballet and even now, it still strikes me as a beautiful and emotional piece of work. Barishnikov has created exquisite and poignant choreography that's not just pretty leaping and jumping, it tells a story in itself. Echoing what another reviewer said, this is especially evident in the Act II Pas de Deux (my favorite piece from the ballet), where the emotion and romance is highly palpable compared to another Nutcracker production I have (Nutcracker: The Motion Picture--1986), where it honestly seemed that Clara and the Prince were just going through the motions. Gelsey Kirkland, Mikhail Barishnikov and Alexander Minz all execute their roles beautifully and it's simply just a joy to watch every time! Some important points:The Arab/Coffee dance is omitted from the production because Barishnikov was under a time constraint for the televised program.In addition to the three toys that dance for the children at the party, there is an additional puppet show that Drosselmeyer puts on for them, which is not part of the traditional plotline and foreshadows the battle between the Prince and the Mouse King.Fritz appears but is not involved in the breaking of the nutcracker at all--that honor goes to a drunken guest at the Christmas party. In addition, the traditional reason for the breaking was out of spite, but in this version, it happens because Clara asks Drosselmeyer to make the nutcracker lifesize. The drunken party guest overhears this and coming over to Clara, pulls on the nutcracker's head trying to make it bigger, which results in it coming off in his hand.It is heavily implied in this adaptation that this same party guest reincarnates later on as the Mouse King, as they are seen wearing similar/identical attire. As another reviewer states, this can be translated into Clara's apparent fear of men (traditionally she is in her teens or even younger), and the dream that Drosselmeyer gives Clara, especially the Act II Pax de Deux, is a therefore a form of gentle godfatherly encouragement for Clara to step out of her shell. This is only one way to analyze the adaptation. All in all, the drunken guest breaking the nutcracker is a great way of foreshadowing his later reappearance as the Mouse King, an arc that gives the story a greater sense of depth as far as Clara's psychology is concerned.Mother Ginger does not appear in this version, and the corresponding dance number is done by four court clowns. The dance delves into the more acrobatic side of dance and for me, is always enjoyable to watch. The clowns in general are great fun as well, their acting is wonderful and they do a great job of adding humor here and there when featured on camera.This version is, I think, less lavish than others especially in terms of sets. The second act in particular has a relatively bland set that, when darkened, fades to a murky dark backdrop and nothing more.But when it comes down to it, this adaptation is a jewel. Strong points include tangible emotion in the storytelling, especially in the Clara-Prince-Drosselmeyer dynamic, and also the dimming of stage lights for Clara and the Prince's solo dances and their Pas de Deux, which gives the story a much more intimate feel and boosts the romance factor in the Pas de Deux.

The orchestra sounds terrible including the percussion section, it seems like every other note has been cut down for certain numbers, if not all of them, and that they don't have a Sugar Plum Fairy. The Clown Dance and the Russian Dance sound pathetic and the orchestral quality simply drowns out the percussion section ands ruins the dance. The costuming in the divertissements looked good too. Kenneth Schermerhorn should respect Tchaikovsky's music if he wants to be a conductor. The only part orchestral-wise I liked was the part when the christmas tree grew enormous and the mouse king and his subjects appear toward that climax. There are better orchestral performances of The Nutcracker available. A more complete one would be the New York City Ballet with David Zinman conducting. The percussion section there is much larger than on here, and the Royal Ballet in Covent Garden with Evgeny Svetlanov conducting the orchestra.

Paired here with a prima ballerina who can keep up with him, as Kirkland can, it's even better.  Just for the sake of the dancing, I love this rendition.Second, I do realize the interaction between Nutcracker/Clara/Drosselmeier can seem a bit twisted, but when watching this as a young adult, I figured Uncle Dross was just getting upset because Clara was falling for this fantasy guy.  As an adult, I believe it can still be argued that he is protective and is trying to wake Clara from a dream that has gotten out of control.  She doesn't want to leave the dream, or the prince, and he is trying to help her.  It doesn't have to be smutty, but you can see how that interpretation can be made.On the downside, the original recording in 1977 had its flaws that can't be or haven't been ""fixed"" - the music can sound flat (hard to do with Tchaikovsky!) and the focus is blurry and bit blue-tinged.  But it's always been that way, even years ago on TV, so it doesn't bother me (I've loved this version for a long time).If you love the dancing or Tchaikovsky's entire score and have no strong feelings for Baryshnikov, this probably isn't the version for you.

282439,A26KPG4EY0JLXM,6301971531,Philip A. Kraus,"[18, 23]","The strengths of this Nutcracker can be summed up very simply: the dancing of Baryshnikov and Kirkland, which is to no one's surprise excellent and engaging. And there is some fine dancing from other members of the American Ballet Theater.However, if you're looking for a Nutcracker that will cause you to revel in the holidays as well as Tchaikovsky's glorious music, this isn't it.The sets by Boris Aronson range from a very ordinary parlor for Act 1 to a downright ugly fantasy candyland for Act 2. The costuming is second rate. The Chinese dancers don't look Chinese; the Russians don't look Russian. Other costuming seems cheap and uninspired. The general filming is too soft focus with not enough color contrast. And who's idea was it to have the ugly Act 2 thrones downstage blocking the action?From a choreographic standpoint, this is also a disappointing production.The children in Act 1 don't have much fun dancing and there are not enough of them. The adults don't act particularly well. It seems corners were cut in a lot of the dances in Act 2 which seem under populated and lacking in imagination and fire. You'd think the Russian dance in a Baryshnikov production would set your TV on fire; it is so tame and forgetable here. The Arabian dance is sadly missing altogether!The idea of having Drosselmeyer appear in the climactic Act 2pas de deux is a major distraction. He's simply out of place and adds no joy to the procedings. I'm sure this was meant as some deep psychological addition to the procedings, but it simply kills the moment and has nothing to do with the sublime music. And Act 2, which should end on a magical note, seems downright despressing in this production as Kirkland gazes out of a window like a lost soul???If you want to revel in Nutcracker as a holiday treat, you must turn to the glorious Balanchine version with the NYC Ballet (on DVD) which has Christmas and joy written all over it. Sumptuosly designed, filmed and cast, it should be your first choice.
