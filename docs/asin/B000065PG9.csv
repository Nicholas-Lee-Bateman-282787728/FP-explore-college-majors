699805,AQBRMBQ99ESI7,B000065PG9,"John A Lee III ""jal3""","[6, 7]","The Lexx universe is a somewhat depressing, Orwellian creation of mindless bureaucracy and an underlying sense of evil. His Divine Shadow, the supreme ruler, exists to rule through order. That makes for a fairly dreary and miserable existence. It is a universe of bread and circuses. There are a few alternatives, however.There is a parallel shadow world about which little is known except that it is chaotic. There is also an active resistance within the realm of His Divine Shadow. The story begins to come together with the confluence of several events.A minor bureaucrat faces ""reprogramming"" or possibly extinction for his minor personal failings. His failure to face his problems leads him to get into deeper trouble.A frumpy woman makes the disorderly mistake of slugging her fianc&eacute; when he is disappointed with her appearance. She is sentenced to a new, very attractive body and life as a sex slave.A leader of the resistance is caught and about to be sentence to death in an arena. He has a plan of escape that goes slightly off plan when one of his gizmos is unwittingly damaged by the bureaucrat mentioned above. He still manages to wreak some havoc and escape in the confusion. He takes with him these previous two characters.The last member of a long dead race is revived to track down these fugitives. He is utilized by His Divine Shadow as an assassin. He is really dead but his body and mind are utilized (against his will) by means of advanced technology. He goes after the fleeing escapees but defects. He helps them to capture the Lexx, an immensely powerful ship. Together, they flee into the shadow zone.The story doesn't hang together too well but it does manage to maintain interest. Partly, this is because of Zev, the very decorative sex slave character. Partly it is because of the hapless bureaucrat who manages to be amusing. Partly it is to see what silliness will occur next. It's certainly not great but I am willing to give it a chance and see what develops.",3,A Silly but Somewhat Entertaining Show,1137456000,"01 17, 2006",2006,1997,"['Lexx', 'universe', 'somewhat', 'depressing', 'Orwellian', 'creation', 'mindless', 'bureaucracy', 'underlying', 'sense', 'evil', 'Divine', 'Shadow', 'supreme', 'ruler', 'rule', 'order', 'fairly', 'dreary', 'miserable', 'existence', 'universe', 'bread', 'circuses', 'are', 'few', 'alternatives', 'parallel', 'shadow', 'world', 'little', 'known', 'chaotic', 'also', 'active', 'resistance', 'realm', 'Divine', 'Shadow', 'story', 'come', 'together', 'confluence', 'several', 'events.A', 'minor', 'bureaucrat', 'reprogramming', 'possibly', 'extinction', 'minor', 'personal', 'failings', 'failure', 'face', 'problems', 'get', 'deeper', 'trouble.A', 'frumpy', 'woman', 'disorderly', 'mistake', 'slugging', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'when', 'disappointed', 'appearance', 'sentenced', 'new', 'very', 'attractive', 'body', 'life', 'sex', 'slave.A', 'leader', 'resistance', 'caught', 'be', 'sentence', 'death', 'arena', 'plan', 'escape', 'slightly', 'off', 'plan', 'when', 'one', 'gizmos', 'unwittingly', 'damaged', 'bureaucrat', 'mentioned', 'above', 'still', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'escape', 'confusion', 'previous', 'two', 'characters.The', 'last', 'member', 'long', 'dead', 'race', 'revived', 'track', 'down', 'fugitives', 'utilized', 'Divine', 'Shadow', 'assassin', 'really', 'dead', 'body', 'mind', 'are', 'utilized', 'will', 'means', 'advanced', 'technology', 'fleeing', 'escapees', 'defects', 'capture', 'Lexx', 'immensely', 'powerful', 'ship', 'Together', 'flee', 'shadow', 'zone.The', 'story', ""n't"", 'hang', 'together', 'too', 'well', 'manage', 'maintain', 'interest', 'Partly', 'Zev', 'very', 'decorative', 'sex', 'slave', 'character', 'Partly', 'hapless', 'bureaucrat', 'who', 'be', 'amusing', 'Partly', 'see', 'what', 'silliness', 'will', 'occur', 'next', 'certainly', 'not', 'great', 'am', 'willing', 'give', 'chance', 'see', 'what']","Lexx Series One ""1.0: I Worship His Shadow"""
