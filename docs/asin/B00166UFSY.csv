1152311,AH4SL0YL5AQVU,B00166UFSY,Alric the Red,"[3, 5]","In our last episode (ofthe 2nd season), Nancy Botwin (Mary-Louise Parker) and her confreres were surrounded by gun-wielding competitors, a thrilling cliffhanger that vexes the hiatus.Weeds - Season Three [Blu-ray] picks up right smack in the middle of that nail-biting scenario.  It's believably resolved and new predicaments are immediately introduced.  Nancy seems on the verge of losing it at times, yet always survives with bedraggled grace and concessions to various foils here and there.  The third season never gets as dark as the previous season, and Nancy has grown more confident from all the scrapes she's endured, laying things down more often on her own terms.  On the less appealing side, sometimes the eccentricities of some of the other characters became a substitute for truly inventive writing, and seemed almost like a condescension to an audience the writers assumed might not notice the difference.  The prime example is this business with her younger son Shane talking to an invisible entity he claimed was his dead father.  From the very first season, I never liked these touchy-feely segues with the kids, and this was the worst yet.  Because the show tries at times to be too quirky, I was distracted by wondering how far the writers were willing to go with this nonsense, that the series, while thinking it's cutting-edge, might devolve into the truly ridiculous.  It was annoying to have to consider how this bit of silliness will conclude.  Regardless of what it turns out to be, it's an absurd divergence from what I watch this series for.  It's not even remotely believable that a boy his age would be enthralled to an overactive imagination to this degree; and it would be just plain stupid if he's not and there's an actual poltergeist about.  Whichever they pick, neither works, as neither fits in with the rest of the series.  Still, it's a series with a lot of other hooks, and we watched the entire third season in two days.Unlike the second season, there was no dire cliffhanger in the finale.  It ties up nicely, with some intriguing possibilities dangling in front of Nancy, with no exigent circumstances attached. The series could have ended right there.  However, there was in facta fourth season, and it's due out on DVD in June.  From the clip I've seen, it appears that it'll be even darker than the 2nd season, with Nancy joining an established smuggling ring.The Blu-ray suffers the same flaws as the second season, in that the palette gets too smeary or too yellow in bright light.  Some facial details are lost behind the glare of the oversaturation.  I've checked with Blu-ray review sites and they've noted the same thing.  Why this series can't get a great transfer that could be recommended on its own right is probably due to the original film elements.  Like most series, clarity -- not cinematography -- is the main objective.  However, it looks great most of the time, and the price was too good to pass up.  At the time I ordered this set, it was cheaper than the standard definition DVDs.It should be noted that the second disc of the set operated peculiarly.  Instead of returning to the episode list when an episode ended, the episode started over.  Not a big deal, because you could still access the menu manually.  That wasn't the case, however, when I tried to watch an extra feature titled ""Kush Kush and Away.""  It wouldn't play, and instead went through the entire loading cycle for the disc, returning to the topmost menu.  Amazon exchanged it, but the replacement had the same error.  So obviously there's a defect through at least a batch of these discs, if not the whole line.Among the other extras that DID work was a faux public-access talk show called ""Good Morning, Agrestic,"" hosted by the series characters Dean Hodes (Andy Milder) and Pam (the goody-two-shoes busybody played by Becky Thyre), interviewing other characters from the series.  Produced strictly as an extra feature for this disc, it was a goofy affair, having a video-taped deadness to it.  It didn't gel.  Parker was conspicuously missing from the fun.  Justin Kirk (who plays Andy Botwin) gets a separate special feature titled ""Uncle AWOL,"" in which he acts the prima donna, encouraged by two lovely young sycophantic assistants.  It, too, was just so-so.___________________________________________________________________",4,Previously . . . on Weeds,1237852800,"03 24, 2009",2009,4366,"['last', 'episode', 'ofthe', '2nd', 'season', 'Nancy', 'Botwin', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'confreres', 'were', 'surrounded', 'gun-wielding', 'competitors', 'thrilling', 'cliffhanger', 'hiatus.Weeds', 'Season', 'Three', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'up', 'right', 'smack', 'middle', 'nail-biting', 'scenario', 'believably', 'resolved', 'new', 'predicaments', 'are', 'immediately', 'introduced', 'Nancy', 'verge', 'losing', 'times', 'always', 'bedraggled', 'grace', 'concessions', 'various', 'foils', 'here', 'there', 'third', 'season', 'never', 'as', 'dark', 'previous', 'season', 'Nancy', 'grown', 'more', 'confident', 'scrapes', 'endured', 'laying', 'things', 'down', 'more', 'often', 'own', 'terms', 'less', 'appealing', 'side', 'sometimes', 'eccentricities', 'other', 'characters', 'became', 'substitute', 'truly', 'inventive', 'writing', 'seemed', 'almost', 'condescension', 'audience', 'writers', 'assumed', 'might', 'not', 'notice', 'difference', 'prime', 'example', 'business', 'younger', 'son', 'Shane', 'talking', 'invisible', 'entity', 'claimed', 'was', 'dead', 'father', 'very', 'first', 'season', 'never', 'liked', 'touchy-feely', 'segues', 'kids', 'was', 'worst', 'yet', 'show', 'times', 'be', 'too', 'quirky', 'was', 'distracted', 'wondering', 'how', 'far', 'writers', 'were', 'willing', 'go', 'nonsense', 'series', 'thinking', 'cutting-edge', 'might', 'devolve', 'truly', 'ridiculous', 'was', 'annoying', 'have', 'consider', 'how', 'bit', 'silliness', 'will', 'conclude', 'Regardless', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'absurd', 'divergence', 'what', 'watch', 'series', 'not', 'even', 'remotely', 'believable', 'boy', 'age', 'would', 'be', 'enthralled', 'overactive', 'imagination', 'degree', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'not', 'actual', 'poltergeist', 'pick', 'works', 'fits', 'rest', 'series', 'Still', 'series', 'lot', 'other', 'hooks', 'watched', 'entire', 'third', 'season', 'two', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'dire', 'cliffhanger', 'finale', 'up', 'nicely', 'intriguing', 'possibilities', 'dangling', 'front', 'Nancy', 'exigent', 'circumstances', 'attached', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'right', 'there', 'However', 'was', 'facta', 'fourth', 'season', 'due', 'out', 'DVD', 'June', 'clip', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'ll"", 'be', 'even', 'darker', '2nd', 'season', 'Nancy', 'joining', 'established', 'smuggling', 'ring.The', 'Blu-ray', 'suffers', 'same', 'flaws', 'second', 'season', 'palette', 'too', 'smeary', 'too', 'yellow', 'bright', 'light', 'facial', 'details', 'are', 'lost', 'glare', 'oversaturation', ""'ve"", 'checked', 'Blu-ray', 'review', 'sites', ""'ve"", 'noted', 'same', 'thing', 'Why', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'great', 'transfer', 'could', 'be', 'recommended', 'own', 'right', 'probably', 'due', 'original', 'film', 'elements', 'most', 'series', 'clarity', 'not', 'cinematography', 'main', 'objective', 'However', 'great', 'most', 'time', 'price', 'was', 'too', 'good', 'pass', 'up', 'time', 'ordered', 'set', 'was', 'cheaper', 'standard', 'definition', 'DVDs.It', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'second', 'disc', 'set', 'operated', 'peculiarly', 'Instead', 'returning', 'episode', 'list', 'when', 'episode', 'ended', 'episode', 'started', 'over', 'Not', 'big', 'deal', 'could', 'still', 'access', 'menu', 'manually', 'was', ""n't"", 'case', 'however', 'when', 'tried', 'watch', 'extra', 'feature', 'titled', 'Kush', 'Kush', 'Away', 'would', ""n't"", 'play', 'instead', 'went', 'entire', 'loading', 'cycle', 'disc', 'returning', 'topmost', 'menu', 'Amazon', 'exchanged', 'replacement', 'had', 'same', 'error', 'So', 'obviously', 'defect', 'least', 'batch', 'discs', 'not', 'whole', 'other', 'extras', 'DID', 'work', 'was', 'faux', 'public-access', 'talk', 'show', 'called', 'Good', 'Morning', 'Agrestic', 'hosted', 'series', 'characters', 'Dean', 'Hodes', 'Andy', 'Milder', 'Pam', 'goody-two-shoes', 'busybody', 'played', 'Becky', 'Thyre', 'interviewing', 'other', 'characters', 'series', 'Produced', 'strictly', 'extra', 'feature', 'disc', 'was', 'goofy', 'affair', 'having', 'video-taped', 'deadness', 'did', ""n't"", 'gel', 'Parker', 'was', 'conspicuously', 'missing', 'fun', 'Justin', 'Kirk', 'who', 'Andy', 'Botwin', 'separate', 'special', 'feature', 'titled', 'Uncle', 'AWOL', 'prima', 'donna', 'encouraged', 'two', 'lovely', 'young', 'sycophantic', 'assistants', 'too', 'was', 'just', 'so-so.___________________________________________________________________']",Weeds: Season 3

I returned it. The season content was a major disappointment anyway, so I am well glad to be rid of the whole thing.

Burning down California wasn't such a stretch-I was just glad they did not film yet another actor watching the fire with himself well in hand-again. There is way too much guys taking matters into their own hands and thinking that this junior high humor is big time funny again and again, when really, an allusion to it may be chuckle worthy once, maybe twice.

1152316,A1P7D9Q9VBDJIL,B00166UFSY,Dead June Bug,"[21, 39]","I saw that Season 3 of Weeds had come out recently, and was tempted to purchase it as I had thoroughly enjoyed Seasons 1 and 2.  However, since I own way too many DVDs that I will never watch again, I opted to be patient and Netflix it instead.  I'm so glad I didn't buy this, as it will never get a repeated viewing from me.There was an excellent cliff-hanger at the end of Season Two, although if the truth be told, even by that point things were getting a little too crazy in the show (but I was still left completely engaged).  After the first couple of episodes of Season 3, however, I started to get a sinking feeling.  It turned into a show about gangsters and thugs, and was a far cry from the 'soccer Mom who deals pot in suburbia' that the series began as.  Sure, there are still some funny parts, and I guess they were enough to make me get through the Season (but just barely), but even Doug and Andy's antics became a little too unbearable and ridiculous to fully enjoy.  There are so many plot twists that simply don't make sense, and many subplots that don't go anywhere and have no place in the series (what the heck did Andy's stint in the Army have to do with ANYTHING?).  Issues get 'resolved' in the most ludicrous ways; it almost feels like the writers want the show to be dumb.  I feel the show 'jumps the shark' a million times and becomes too unrealistic to take seriously.  As another reviewer stated, sometimes the show feels almost 'cartoony'.I was glad after the last episode was done.  It was a hard watch, but for some reason I felt I had to see it through until the end.  For me the season finale felt like it wrapped the entire series up, and I don't care where Nancy goes now that Agrestic is up in flames.  I am done with Weeds, and I will not watch Season 4.  It's really a shame to know that a series that started off so strong sunk so low.  But this seems to be the trend all too often.As for the DVD quality itself, of course the picture and sound are excellent.

The show's characters have never exactly been fine upstanding citizens, but here they're just blatantly awful and painted in such broad strokes that they become cartoonish stereotypes rather than people.  The gangstas are gun-toting, violent rapists, but are ""endearing"" with their witty dialogue.  Kevin Nealon's character is over-the-top obnoxious, but everyone loves him.  And worst of all, the military are morally bankrupt, testosterone-dripping murderous homophobes.  Now, I'm no red-state war-lover, and I think that they kind of ARE those things, at times, but the show is so juvenile in its stereotyping, that even I am frustrated by it.  Same goes for religious zealots.  I have major problems with organized religion, but portraying them teaching the sin of abortion to children and speaking in tongues, without admitting any of their good traits, is cliched, one-sided, one-note foolishness.  I get that it's all meant to be funny - and I often like comedy that stereotypes groups for a laugh - but much of the humor here is lost on me.  This once-witty show now seems like a stoner's poorly constructed view of the world - people involved in drug culture are cool, and ""the man"" is oppressive and evil.Weeds hasn't become unwatchable, but the really great scenes are few and far between.

Menta, Jr.","[4, 6]","You've heard the drill in these TV-on-DVD reviews: if you liked the first two seasons of Showtime's ""Weeds"", you should like the third.  Having said that, season three isn't inspiring me to write a jump-for-joy, rave-filled review.  For one thing, I can cut a break for a widowed soccer mom forced to deal drugs for a while to make ends meet, but Nancy has been doing this for going on three years now, if not longer.  I know that one doesn't have to admire what a series character does to enjoy a particular show (I like ""Dexter"" and ""The Sopranos"", after all), but for some reason it's bugging me that Nancy continues to embrace criminal behavior.  I know, I know... it's a silly criticism of a show that's not really meant to be taken seriously.  It's probably because Nancy is cute and fun and an otherwise good mom that I want her to stop being a felon.Also, the season-long story thread was a bit choppy this time, with plotlines starting up and then quickly abandoned, or left unsatisfyingly under-explored.  In the case of the brief, pointless ""Andy grabbed by the army"" plotline, that one shouldn't have even started in the first place (though I admit it did have a laugh or two).  Another missed opportunity was the presence of those usually-reliable-for-laughs cable comedy mainstays: loony evangelicals.  But even here there were misfires.  Oddly, in the episodes where the crazed born-agains appeared, they either weren't ridiculed enough or were ridiculed too much (which isn't easy, let me tell you).  Never a happy medium.  Weird, huh?Good moments?  Yep, still a lot of them.  Celia's husband and Councilman Doug finding ways to work on a porn movie set, and their response to being there, are a riot.  Good-looking women in those episodes, too.  And speaking of good looking, Mary-Louise Parker remains cute as a button.  But I think I said that already.The ""Weeds, Season Three"" DVD delivers fifteen episodes (the longest season to date), some commentary tracks, and a few goofy extras of no real consequence.  The episodes look and sound great.I still like ""Weeds"", and will seek out the fourth season when it comes out on DVD (it helps that there's a pretty interesting close to the season, which genuinely makes us ask, ""what will these characters do next?""), but I'm hoping that the show's junior year mild slump is only temporary.  If season four gets fully back on track, mainly by delivering sharper, interesting storylines on a more consistent basis, I won't even mind if Nancy still keeps dealing drugs.  Which is pretty much a given anyway, I'm guessing.",3,"A few episodes are made out of the same ""ticky-tacky"" as the ""little boxes"" in the theme song",1226275200,"11 10, 2008",2008,2582,"[""'ve"", 'heard', 'drill', 'TV-on-DVD', 'reviews', 'liked', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Showtime', 'Weeds', 'should', 'like', 'third', 'Having', 'said', 'season', 'three', ""n't"", 'inspiring', 'write', 'jump-for-joy', 'rave-filled', 'review', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'cut', 'break', 'widowed', 'soccer', 'mom', 'forced', 'deal', 'drugs', 'while', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'Nancy', 'been', 'doing', 'going', 'three', 'years', 'now', 'not', 'longer', 'know', 'one', ""n't"", 'have', 'admire', 'what', 'series', 'character', 'enjoy', 'particular', 'show', 'like', 'Dexter', 'Sopranos', 'reason', 'bugging', 'Nancy', 'embrace', 'criminal', 'behavior', 'know', 'know', 'silly', 'criticism', 'show', 'not', 'really', 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'probably', 'Nancy', 'cute', 'fun', 'otherwise', 'good', 'mom', 'want', 'stop', 'being', 'felon.Also', 'season-long', 'story', 'thread', 'was', 'bit', 'choppy', 'time', 'plotlines', 'starting', 'up', 'then', 'quickly', 'abandoned', 'left', 'unsatisfyingly', 'under-explored', 'case', 'brief', 'pointless', 'Andy', 'grabbed', 'army', 'plotline', 'one', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'even', 'started', 'first', 'place', 'admit', 'did', 'have', 'laugh', 'two', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'was', 'presence', 'usually-reliable-for-laughs', 'cable', 'comedy', 'mainstays', 'loony', 'evangelicals', 'even', 'here', 'were', 'misfires', 'Oddly', 'episodes', 'where', 'crazed', 'born-agains', 'appeared', 'were', ""n't"", 'ridiculed', 'enough', 'were', 'ridiculed', 'too', 'much', ""n't"", 'easy', 'let', 'tell', 'happy', 'medium', 'Weird', 'huh', 'Good', 'moments', 'Yep', 'still', 'lot', 'Celia', 'husband', 'Councilman', 'Doug', 'finding', 'ways', 'work', 'porn', 'movie', 'set', 'response', 'being', 'there', 'are', 'riot', 'Good-looking', 'women', 'episodes', 'too', 'speaking', 'good', 'looking', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'cute', 'button', 'think', 'said', 'already.The', 'Weeds', 'Season', 'Three', 'DVD', 'delivers', 'fifteen', 'episodes', 'longest', 'season', 'date', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'few', 'goofy', 'extras', 'real', 'consequence', 'episodes', 'look', 'sound', 'great.I', 'still', 'Weeds', 'will', 'seek', 'out', 'fourth', 'season', 'when', 'out', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'close', 'season', 'genuinely', 'ask', 'what', 'will', 'characters', 'do', 'next', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'show', 'junior', 'year', 'mild', 'slump', 'only', 'temporary', 'season', 'four', 'fully', 'back', 'track', 'mainly', 'delivering', 'sharper', 'interesting', 'storylines', 'more', 'consistent', 'basis', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'mind', 'Nancy', 'still', 'dealing', 'drugs', 'Which', 'pretty', 'much', 'given', 'anyway', ""'m"", 'guessing']",Weeds: Season 3

The characters still treat each other with the requisite malice and distaste, but the spark seems to be going out. (Thankfully I'm in Season 4 now and things are back to normal.)

Nothing in the previous seasons prepared us for the unbelievable dips in the storytelling, particularly those involving Andy, Nancy's affable, ne-er-do-well brother in law.  If I was the actor, I would be crying every day, realizing that a once promising part had apparently led the writers into thinking they could just ask me to do anything and my contract would require me to do it.  There's no other excuse for the Andy joins the army storyline or even worse, the one in which Andy joins the adult film industry by using his foot.  It is a black mark on TV, though who knows, some may think it funny.It's almost as though they have one crew of writers for two weeks, then another one comes along and sweeps everything out.  How about Nancy longing for friends and growing obsessed, to the point of sketching her repeatedly on a pad of paper, with her husband's former wife and stalking to stalk her so that they can be pals?  And whatever did happen to the money both women were searching for?  They just dropped it, probably because they were fired.  I don't know how the actors keep track of how they're supposed to be feeling and who they've not slept with by this point.  Mary Kate Olsen -- lots of bad karma.  Matthew Modine -- not appealing.Never thought I'd say this, but I'm getting tired of drugs, and also tired of the way WEEDS, which seemed like sort of a progressive show to begin with, treats its black actors and characters.  They are either Mandingo type studs, or drug mules, or dumb as posts.  When Conrad and Nancy had their big lovemaking scene, where she's sitting down and he's standing before her, the camera just gawks at his naked hips grinding away, as though his butt was the biggest thing ever to appear on TV.  And then cut away, and then back to it.

1152341,A3C8FJF510MY4D,B00166UFSY,Patient observer,"[1, 1]","This show was good for 2 seasons and went terminal in the 3rd season, the rest of the seasons just cash in on the name.  How it eeked out six more seasons is beyond me, maybe everyone kept watching to see if it would get better.Now that isn't to say the first two seasons didn't have their problems but they were interesting and well written enough to assume it would get better.The problems on this show stems from how unbelievable it is, some of the situations the Nancy character is put in and how she gets out of them stops being realistic sometime in season 1.  It doesn't make sense that experience people would follow a novice in the world of drug dealing.  It's more of a lead character role/hollywood thing and it kills the show.  Real criminals pounce on females trying to walk the darkside unless they prove to be a force to be reckoned with, ""nancy's"" force is the writers.  The character just does whatever she wants and suffers no real consequences, she would have attracted attention from people she couldn't handle.  Basically in the real world she would have been dead or turning tricks real after(or before) getting in debt to uturn.  Being 150k in debt doesn't make you a personal assistant, it did on the show but really, he would have had her dancing in clubs and servicing people on top of selling drugs to make his money back.  I'm sure the star didn't want the character portrayed that way but that's what really would happen.They show some truth in this with how she dealt with the small time pot dealer but the follow up of her brushing him off after is bull.  He would have dictated her terms not the other way around. Her sleeping with him one time then he's working for her, I don't think so.  He wouldn't have been trying to romance her, he would have tried breaking her and pimping her off.  They say art mirrors life and that's the issue here, it should, even i it's one of those gaint wavy funhouse mirrors.I also question Conrad leaving her in there with uturn, I don't see that happening, it betrays the character.  I think it was just a way to break the onscreen chemistry between the two and so fans would grow to dislike him.  I saw him walking out with her out of the grow house and then cutting ties for good after they got some distance away from uturn.  They still could of had uturn pop in and control her after finding out the truth, it would have made a lot more sense that way. The writer apparently like the ida of her hooking up with mexicans more and that's fine, just don't portray the Conrad character as eating out of her hand.  He would have moved on, period.  I guess that's what they were trying to accomplish but they went about it all wrong.After that the show pretty much falls off the tracks, it remains a bit entertaining and you hope it improve but it just gets worst and worst.  I really hated how the cecilia character devolved into a punching/abuse bag.  I just don't see it especially given the jail time even if she was someone else's plaything in the story it should have harden her.  Not make her all weepy and willing to accept abuse, she never reached her breaking point and should have instead of just being comic relief.To sum it up it's like friday meets desperate housewives and after they gains some popularity they ditch the African american actors(who made it funny) and apparently the good writers as the show starts going downhill during and after the 3rd season.  The guy playing andy does ok but he worked best with the Dean character and the two never got enough screen time together.  The coyote thing should have went to the forefront and the Nancy character's storyline should have taken a backseat.  It wasn't entertaining.  She get's old really quick, they try to angle her as a manipulator but in the underworld she would have been used abused and tossed aside.  You can't write a show about ""empowered"" woman when she has no power base, no angle...absolutely nothing to leverage.Watch the first two seasons and maybe the third but trust me it's not worth it after that, it becomes a waste of time.I really hope all the suburban kids watching this aren't influenced by what they see, it never ends like the movies.

This is the longest season of Weeds so far, and I watched it ten times faster than any season before it.  In two days, I'd muscled through all fifteen episodes, which make have contributed in small part to how COMPLETE the thing just felt.  Like no season of the show before it, it tests all the characters and takes the story to the next level.  While all of the other seasons were almost sinfully entertaining, this one is so excellent in all levels, from character development to the intricate plot that picks up on the cliffhanger that endedSeason Twoand produces the most cohesive story so far.  This brings everything from the first two seasons together for such an incredible climax that it makes me want to watch the whole Weeds catalogue all over again.  While it's not pitch perfect (as funny as the Andy military stuff was, it was a bit too much for me to buy), it's the best season so far.  Superbly acted (I mean... Mary-Louise Parker... c'mon Emmys), humbly but excellently written, and visually stunning, Weeds is one of the best shows out there.THE PACKAGE: I get the whole going green thing.  I even think the fact that Weeds went green is a bit funny.  However, I stopped getting it and I certainly stopped laughing when I realized that this flimsy, recycled packaging causes the DVDs to fall about and get scratched.  As sympathetic as I am to the cause... I don't want to keep buying the third season of Weeds over and over because the box can't hold a DVD.  A show this superb deserves packaging that will support it, and Weeds was not given that.  They should re-release this in the same format as the first and second seasons, because this is truly a disservice to the loyal fans.  The packaging is obviously rated a negative... let's just say fifteen, but that has no impact on how many stars I give this.

Webb ""Trajedi""","[5, 8]","My expectations for this series not unlike a gifted child were high, and while season 3 is far from a failure, one just wanted so much more.  The characters are all here, (perhaps too many for a 26 min an episode show) and they generally act like themselves but the overall lack of character development coupled with very convenient writing which has many acting completely out of character drain the life from an otherwise amazingly entertaining show.  Eventually turning into a satire of itself Weeds Season 3 goes from decent to maudlin and revives the spirit of renewal in its final episode, perhaps too late however.  The people I used to care about start making ridiculous decisions, as the writing becomes basically a filmed graphic novel with outrageous plot twists set in motion to further situations and happenings that just border on the inane or downright unbelievable.  Shanes character becomes the breath of fresh air as he expresses the writers general feeling toward our culture and social climate, but it is almost too much coming from a kid his age.  Again it is a fine entertainment value overall the BluRay discs look great and the extras are fun, Kush Kush and Away is a great little diverison (flash game) but in the end I was glad I rented rather than bought this season, and Season 1 will probably be the only one I keep in my collection.

Whether it's losing a beloved spouse, saying good-bye to a cherished job, or even leaving a loveless-but-comfortable marriage, everyone in Season 3 seems to be losing something . . . and we're not talking just a few toes here.Through it all, Ms. Botwin soldiers on with her unique combination of bravado, naivete, and occasional ruthlessness.

You have to go down the rabbit hole to appreciate ""Weeds,"" (how else can you appreciate Kevin Nealon as a stoned-yet-effective city magistrate?) but once you're there, you're there to stay.",4,Things still antagonistic in Agrestic,1266969600,"02 24, 2010",2010,1184,"['Showtime', 'Weeds', 'comic', 'savaging', 'Suburbia', 'Season', '3', 'new', 'season', 'resolution', 'Season', '2', 'definitive', 'cliff-hanger', 'Mexican', 'standoff', 'guns', 'pointed', 'Nancy', 'Botwin', 'America', 'favorite', 'amateur', 'pot', 'dealer.Season', '3', 'Widow', 'Botwin', 'extended', 'family', 'misfits', 'fools', 'noblemen', 'plunge', 'even', 'deeper', 'maelstrom', 'having', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'ripped', 'asunder', 'losing', 'beloved', 'spouse', 'saying', 'good-bye', 'cherished', 'job', 'even', 'leaving', 'loveless-but-comfortable', 'marriage', 'everyone', 'Season', '3', 'be', 'losing', 'something', ""'re"", 'not', 'talking', 'just', 'few', 'toes', 'Ms.', 'Botwin', 'soldiers', 'unique', 'combination', 'bravado', 'naivete', 'occasional', 'ruthlessness', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Weeds', 'Season', '3', 'more', 'same', 'extremely', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'rampant', 'bizarre', 'sexual', 'affairs', 'occasional', 'spot', 'violence', 'plot', 'developments', 'there', 'work', 'have', 'go', 'down', 'rabbit', 'hole', 'appreciate', 'Weeds', 'how', 'else', 'can', 'appreciate', 'Kevin', 'Nealon', 'stoned-yet-effective', 'city', 'magistrate', 'once', ""'re"", 'there', ""'re"", 'stay']",Weeds: Season 3

After this season the supporting characters will change and the show will go downhill fast. So savour this last trip around the McMansions (complete with a crooked real-estate developer), Celia's last meaningful contribution to the show, and the lighter more comic side of Weeds. Season Three hits most of the high notes well and if you continue past this season you'll be sad that we can never really go home again. Weeds has some very funny bits this year, lots of satire, and less of the hopped-up faux drama that takes over the series when the Botwins bug out at the end.

I got mine from Amazon last week and have already watched the whole season and it was great! I was nervous going in because I had heard from various people that season three wasn't as good, but after I got watching I was not at all sure what the fuss was about, the show is pushing itself and growing in new directions like it needs to if it's going to survive. The show challenges you to think about ""drugs,"" what's right and wrong, and examines the inter-workings of suburbia with such cleverness that I am always pleasantly surprised.Nancy Botwin is the perfect character, you love her, but sometimes want to slap her. Parker is an amazing actress and makes this show work from beginning to end. I also love her youngest Shane, he's excellent this season and glad to see him getting more and more airtime. This show is both funny and heartbreaking and blows most shows on TV right now out of the water.I'm really excited to see how season 4 plays out. I think it's a great sign that they are breaking out of the ""little boxes.""Don't listen to the negative reviews.

While I did get the sense that, Nancy will never win and got frustrated at her life/circumstances (won't give anything away)...I still really enjoyed this season and am ready to watch Season 4!I thought this season showed us a new side of many characters, Celia, Silas, Shane, Andy and Dean.  I liked how the cliff hanger from season 2 was dealt with.  And in each half hour there was enough drama that at the end of each show you were ready to watch the next one to see what was going to happen.My only complaint with Weeds is that the plot seems to be repeating with regards to Nancy and nearly getting caught selling, then her being in debt to someone etc.  I've finished season 4, and that's what has made me a little dismayed at the fact that it does seem to be the same formula over & over...but I'm waiting till Season 5 to make up my mind on that.Again, I think Showtime has hit paydirt with an original, fun show.  The half hour format is what does it for me, something quick to pop in and sit back and relax to.

She is so very naive about the world of drug dealing, and finds out just how much she doesn't know in this third season of the series.She has experiences with U-Turn and Marvin that are both hilarious and unpleasant, and then along comes Guillermo, a new kind of thug who ends up wreaking havoc on Agrestic/Majestic that Nancy never imagined.Celia is by turns sympathetic and hateful, given her behavior towards her former husband and their daughter; yet we can also see how much she wants to love someone and how she drowns her sorrows in alcohol.Kevin Nealon, for my money, is the one who really shines. The SNL alum does his best and funniest work here as Nancy's CPA.I'm surprised to say this, but Mary-Kate Olsen does a nice job as Silas's religious girlfriend.Alexander Gould as Shane gets more screen time, and it is well deserved.  It's too bad that he and Celia's kid couldn't have spent more time in the religious school, where they were shaking things up.Yes, things change drastically by the end of the season, but there's nothing wrong with that.
