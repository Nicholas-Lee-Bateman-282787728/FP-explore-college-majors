504764,A35QF1GDLAFYCL,B00000IQVD,"A. Calabrese ""othernj""","[13, 14]","Gods and Monsters directed by Bill Condon and starring Ian McKellen, Brendan Fraser, and Lynn Redgrave is a film about the last days of director James Whale.  While it is a fictional account of Whale's last days it seems to based on fact.Whale is most famous for his direction of the films, Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, and the 1936 version of Showboat.Ian McKellen is superb as the ex-patriot homosexual forgotten director.  He portrays Whale as a man haunted by his past and desires.  Fraser as the lawn boy who befriends Whale is great.  Fraser's portrayal of a young man without purpose questioning his own sexuality is acting at its finest.  Finally, Lynn Redgrave is great as the religious Hungarian housekeeper, sure Whale is destined for hell, but despite her employer's failings continues to show him love and compassion.Director Condon does a great job visually of portraying how Whale's humor came across in his films.  But, more importantly shows how the backdrop for Whale's horror films were a reflection of his past.If you like me were led to believe that Karloff was the force behind our great horror film masterpieces see this DVD.",5,A monster in the mirror of the mind,1136160000,"01 2, 2006",2006,1156,"['Gods', 'Monsters', 'directed', 'Bill', 'Condon', 'starring', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'film', 'last', 'days', 'director', 'James', 'Whale', 'fictional', 'account', 'Whale', 'last', 'days', 'based', 'fact.Whale', 'most', 'famous', 'direction', 'films', 'Frankenstein', 'Bride', 'Frankenstein', '1936', 'version', 'Showboat.Ian', 'McKellen', 'superb', 'ex-patriot', 'homosexual', 'forgotten', 'director', 'Whale', 'man', 'haunted', 'past', 'desires', 'Fraser', 'lawn', 'boy', 'who', 'Whale', 'great', 'Fraser', 'portrayal', 'young', 'man', 'purpose', 'questioning', 'own', 'sexuality', 'acting', 'finest', 'Finally', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'great', 'religious', 'Hungarian', 'housekeeper', 'sure', 'Whale', 'destined', 'hell', 'employer', 'failings', 'show', 'love', 'compassion.Director', 'Condon', 'great', 'job', 'visually', 'portraying', 'how', 'Whale', 'humor', 'came', 'films', 'more', 'importantly', 'how', 'backdrop', 'Whale', 'horror', 'films', 'were', 'reflection', 'past.If', 'were', 'led', 'believe', 'Karloff', 'was', 'force', 'great', 'horror', 'film', 'masterpieces', 'see', 'DVD']",N/A

504766,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B00000IQVD,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[1, 1]","A sexually upfront, retired film director who happened to be gay (Ian McKellen).  His tut-tutting Germanic housekeeper (Lynn Redgrave).  Their hostile, hunky ex-Marine lawnboy (Brendan Fraser).  The characters are the stuff of stereotype but in this fine movie, based loosely on the last days of 1930s movie director James Whale (*Frankenstein*, *Bride of Frankenstein*, *Showboat*), excellent writing and performances combine to make GODS AND MONSTERS a worthwhile if occasionally provocative film about the classic themes of love and death.It's 1957 and the aging Whale, comfortably retired in L.A., take a shine to the new lawnboy Clayton Boone (a fictional creation) and asks him to pose for a painting.  The young man is reluctant at first but goes along for the easy work and ready money.  Clay is -- let's say -- pretty touchy about his virtue until Whale makes it clear the boy is in no danger from him.  A curious platonic friendship emerges and grows based on mutual trust and respect (one small example:  Whale, escorted by Clay, attends a snotty lawn party and derives immense satisfaction from twitting the still-closeted George Cukor).This film is almost entirely a character study and the events that close the movie most likely happened in real life: Whale was found dead in his swimming pool, most likely a suicide brought on by diminished capacity.  The real action in this picture are the multiple indignities young Whale suffered as a hobbled preacher's kid and a novice Army officer in the horrible trenches of World War One, like mini-autobiographical snippents that Whale ""imagines"" cinematically and relates to Clay.  Some welcome comic relief follows in a dream Clay has, a campy recreation of BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, with Clay himself cast as the blockheaded monster on a flawlessly re-created Universal Pictures studio set.  Those sequences are in bluish black-and-white but most of the film has a deliberately burnished, Fifties widescreen Technicolor look that is just grand to watch.  The powerful performances are key here, as well:  rather than merely triangulate his three powerful stars, director and co-writer Bill Condon pairs off Fraser, McKellen and Redgrave and lets their characters grow in nuance, not react strictly to form.I do not know why GODS AND MONSTERS was a relative disappointment at the box office when it played in 1998; perhaps McKellen's forthright portrayal of a gay man was too strong for the mass audience back then.  Perhaps Brendan Fraser had, during that period, been stereotyped as a George-of-the-Jungle goofus and turned off the potential art-house crowd.  (In fact, his performance in this pic is marvelous and every bit the equal of the two veterans he played off.)  Although they occupy little screen play, the supporting task is fine too and includes Lolita Davidovich as Clay Boone's soon-to-be-ex-girlfriend and some dead ringers at the lawn party for Boris Karloff, Elsa Lancaster and Elizabeth Taylor.  Production standards do not disappoint, both interior and exterior shots are sumptuous and full of meaning; in fact, one of the high points of director Condon's very good Commentary on the disc is learning how much was put up there on screen at relatively low cost and in very little time.I feel GODS AND MONSTERS has been unjustly ignored and feel it deserves a wider audience.  For what it's worth it's not a ""gay movie"" any more than it is an ex-Marine movie but tells its own story with an almost chamber-like precision and a pinpoint visual palette.  Not a kiddie movie but a literate film that combines wit, brave characterizations and lots of good old entertainment value.

Yes, there are  quite a few scenes that may make the weak at heart flinch ! The real story  or hidden message is not so much the gay attraction Whale has for Boone or  the disgust Boone feels towards homosexuality. They both have a longing or  yearning to have some type of normal male sibling companionship that they  did not have with their own fathers ! Both characters had fathers who were  tough and mentally abusive towards Boone and Whale. Boone's father thought  he was a weak coward for being discharged from the marines while Whale's  father ( and mother) ridiculed his talent for drawing and placed him in a  factory to work at a young age. This is the common ground that both men  share. Also, Boone gives Whale a mental jolt or flashback everytime Whale  sees him of his days past as a young man (rejuvenation) while Whale  (whether intentional or not) shows Boone how to be almost a gentleman and  not a knuckledragger without class. However, the true (non-sexual) hidden  agenda Whale has in mind for Boone and himself is a real exciting twister  !The only downfall of the movie is that it is slow paced ( for some  reason most Oscar material is; a thinking filmgoer's movie). Fraser  deserves 5 stars for taking such a challenging role and losing the comical,  big goofy guy role for a change. His young and fresh acting skills contrast  with the other veteran actors for good intent and purpose to really add  depth to the characters and story (his youthful persona contrasting with  the seasoned and experienced).

I found GODS' serious tone quite different from the hilarious Tim Burton flick ED WOOD.  Being straight, but not homophobic, I was still a bit uncomfortable with the 2 men kissing near the beginning.  But after that I was impressed with this multi-facited story.I thought Fraiser was excellent and believable as the big manly lug. McKellen's James Whale in GODS compares with Landau's Bela Lugosi in ED WOOD.  Both actors take their young counterparts back to acting school to a certain extent.  This is a movie that keeps you wondering where it is going next.

504774,A3R4TS03ITT2JC,B00000IQVD,Bob Thompson,"[14, 16]","Only at the very end does it become abundantly clear exactly what this film is all about. Initially &quot;Gods and Monsters&quot; just seems like  a mild mannered tale between an old movie director and his gardener. Even  if the film were that simple it would still be great. Fortunately there is  something bigger at work here, a sly genius that only really seems clear  when Brendan Fraser is walking around in the rain at the end and the  credits roll up. When &quot;Gods and Monsters&quot; finally reveals exactly  what it's trying to say then it can really be seen as a classic Hollywood  picture.Ian McKellen is unquestionably the star of the show here. He is  so vastly superior to everyone on the screen that he alone carries the  picture. He plays film director James Whale who has just had a stroke and  is reaching the end of his life. After a while he begins to take an  interest in his gardener, Clay Boone, played excellently by Brendan Fraser.  Initially you wonder if Mckellen, a homosexual, is only interested in  Fraser for gay purposes. In one scene prior to his arrival Mckellen takes  great delight in forcing a film student to undress for him. That isn't the  case though as Mckellen seems to be genuinly interested in Fraser's  friendship. The two talk, Mckellen is very nostalgiac and tells Fraser  stories about his time in lower class England as a child, his experiences  in the war and his eventual exile from the Hollywood community.As the  film progresses Ian Mckellen starts to gradually deteriorate. Overcome by  memories of the past he eventually takes his own life by drowning in a  swimming pool. His death, although saddening seems strangely appropriate  given the circumstances of the film. In one great scene before his death,  Brendan Fraser escorts Mckellen onto his former battlefield and lays him to  rest next to other dead soldiers.  While watching James Whale's most famous  movies (The Frankenstein pictures) there is emphasis on one scene which  intentionally runs paralels to the Fraser/Mckellen relationship. In one  scene of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; the monster comes to the door of a blind  man who claims that he is alone &quot;and no soul has spoken to me for  years.&quot; It is obvious at this point that Fraser's sole purpose was to  provide happiness and companionship to this agening man and evtually lead  him into death.Well, enough ranting, &quot;Gods and Monsters&quot; is  carried off in fine style. Some may find it long winded and slow, but  Mckellen's charm and great scripting should be enough to get most film fans  through. Vanessa Redgrave also turns in a great role despite it being  significantly smaller than Mckellen's or Fraser's. There is one scene of  reminiscing about boys in a swimming pool which maybe is a tad over the top  but on the whole Gods and Monsters is a very effective and a very  intelligent piece of work.",5,"No Gods, Just Monsters",969408000,"09 20, 2000",2000,2898,"['Only', 'very', 'end', 'become', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'exactly', 'what', 'film', 'Initially', 'quot', 'Gods', 'Monsters', 'quot', 'just', 'mild', 'mannered', 'tale', 'old', 'movie', 'director', 'gardener', 'Even', 'film', 'were', 'simple', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'great', 'Fortunately', 'something', 'bigger', 'work', 'here', 'sly', 'genius', 'only', 'really', 'clear', 'when', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'walking', 'around', 'rain', 'end', 'credits', 'roll', 'up', 'When', 'quot', 'Gods', 'Monsters', 'quot', 'finally', 'exactly', 'what', 'trying', 'say', 'then', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'seen', 'classic', 'Hollywood', 'picture.Ian', 'McKellen', 'unquestionably', 'star', 'show', 'here', 'so', 'vastly', 'superior', 'everyone', 'screen', 'alone', 'picture', 'film', 'director', 'James', 'Whale', 'who', 'just', 'had', 'stroke', 'reaching', 'end', 'life', 'while', 'take', 'interest', 'gardener', 'Clay', 'Boone', 'played', 'excellently', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'Initially', 'wonder', 'Mckellen', 'homosexual', 'only', 'interested', 'Fraser', 'gay', 'purposes', 'one', 'scene', 'prior', 'arrival', 'Mckellen', 'great', 'delight', 'forcing', 'film', 'student', 'undress', ""n't"", 'case', 'Mckellen', 'be', 'genuinly', 'interested', 'Fraser', 'friendship', 'two', 'talk', 'Mckellen', 'very', 'nostalgiac', 'tells', 'Fraser', 'stories', 'time', 'lower', 'class', 'England', 'child', 'experiences', 'war', 'eventual', 'exile', 'Hollywood', 'community.As', 'film', 'Ian', 'Mckellen', 'gradually', 'deteriorate', 'Overcome', 'memories', 'past', 'eventually', 'own', 'life', 'drowning', 'swimming', 'pool', 'death', 'saddening', 'strangely', 'appropriate', 'given', 'circumstances', 'film', 'one', 'great', 'scene', 'death', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'Mckellen', 'former', 'battlefield', 'rest', 'next', 'other', 'dead', 'soldiers', 'watching', 'James', 'Whale', 'most', 'famous', 'movies', 'Frankenstein', 'emphasis', 'one', 'scene', 'intentionally', 'paralels', 'Fraser/Mckellen', 'relationship', 'one', 'scene', 'quot', 'Frankenstein', 'quot', 'monster', 'door', 'blind', 'man', 'who', 'alone', 'quot', 'soul', 'spoken', 'years.', 'quot', 'obvious', 'point', 'Fraser', 'sole', 'purpose', 'was', 'provide', 'happiness', 'companionship', 'agening', 'man', 'evtually', 'lead', 'death.Well', 'enough', 'ranting', 'quot', 'Gods', 'Monsters', 'quot', 'carried', 'off', 'fine', 'style', 'may', 'find', 'long', 'winded', 'slow', 'Mckellen', 'charm', 'great', 'scripting', 'should', 'be', 'enough', 'get', 'most', 'film', 'fans', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'also', 'great', 'role', 'being', 'significantly', 'smaller', 'Mckellen', 'Fraser', 'one', 'scene', 'reminiscing', 'boys', 'swimming', 'pool', 'maybe', 'tad', 'top', 'whole', 'Gods', 'Monsters', 'very', 'effective', 'very', 'intelligent', 'piece', 'work']",N/A

Ians performance brought the pain and injustice done to a man who who was once Hollywoods greatest directors now a recluse, to the forefront. I never knew James Whale was Gay for many years till I read it mentioned in an article. It didnt matter. When this movie came out, my favorite actor Brendan Frasier, was in it so it was a must see.How sad to know that this great artist, was living alone in Los Angeles, not much better off then Lugosi was at the end of his life.  His recollections to his Gardner played by Brendan, who was there more as a catalyst to tell James story then anything else, were heart wrenching as he described the young man he was in love with who died in WW1. ""We lost a whole generation in that war"" cannot help but bring tears to your eyes when you realize that WW1 was as much a horror as WW2. Whales sense of loss truly extended to all those who lived thru it with him as so many of Englands male population didnt make it back from the trenches, and he makes you feel the grief.I came away from this movie asking if anybody could have done anything to alleviate his alienation. Could fans in the area or travelling in California from out of state, stopping by to say hello, changed his mind about suicide if thats what it was.I know he was suffering physical pain as well, but maybe if fans had come by to let him know they cared, his ending might have been more peacefull and serene.The Gay aspect of his life was not played up to garner pity, it was not a major influence on the direction of the film at all. It was all about him and a studio that tossed him to the wolves when his known friends could not protect him from the morality patrol.The hypocrites in Hollywood who cheated on their wives, probably poked young stagehands and took drugs kicked the chair out from under James Talented body and left him to hang.By the time this movie was over I was crying like a little kid, and still makes me wonder.

504777,AKBKTA49ZTT2T,B00000IQVD,Bruce,"[5, 6]","Gods and Monsters' is filmmaking at its best, depicting the final days of James Whale, a complex and complicated man, famous for directing the first two `Frankenstein' films, 'The Invisible Man', and the original movie version of `Showboat.' Exquisite performances are given by the great Sir Ian McKellen as Whale, who executes every nuance, every witticism, every emotion, with a perfection that is little short of incredible; Lynn Redgrave as Hanna, Whale's formidable but devoted housekeeper; and Brendan Fraser, in a wonderfully humane acting turn as Clayton Boone, Whale's hunky groundskeeper, who is unwittingly and inexorably drawn into Whale's ever-increasingly confused and confusing world. Whale's initial interest in Clay is sexually motivated, but the relationship becomes much more labyrinthine for both men than is originally bargained for. But the real `stars' of this movie are the direction (Bill Condon, who also wrote the screenplay) and the cinematography, producing visuals that are often haunting and infinitely memorable, especially during the flashback sequences and in the metaphorical &quot;monster&quot; scenes. One of my favorites is a scene in which Fraser gazes at his own reflection in a sink filled with water--it's a breathtakingly fragile image, shivery and shimmering and achingly delicate, and it seems to suggest at something much deeper and far-reaching within Clay himself. This is a film filled with such images and subtext--dreamlike, poetic touches, superimposed within the structure of an otherwise `conventional' story.

504784,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B00000IQVD,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[7, 7]","I went into watching this film expecting to see nothing more than some Oscar caliber acting.  It's not that I'm not a fan of the biopic, quite the opposite indeed, but I remember when this film was released and I remember having no desire to see it whatsoever.  I broke down last week and said ""what the heck"" and watched it, beginning to end, and I have to say that I was utterly impressed by just about every aspect of this film.  I wasn't privy to the life of famed Frankenstein director James Whale previous to watching this film, in fact the only part of his life I was aware of was his open homosexuality.  What I wasn't aware of was his constant pains of loneliness and despair.  The film so richly helps us to see that James only craved company, really nothing more than that.Ian McKellen probably gives his most superb performance here with his portrayal of the ailing Whale.  His every movement is so intricate and well thought out that you forget your watching an actor.  He was completely confidant and convincing in every way and well deserved that Oscar nod, and arguably the Oscar (I'm still on the Edward Norton bandwagon myself).The film explores the last days of Whale's life, as he becomes infatuated with his new gardener Clay Boone (Played by Brendan Fraser in a performance filled with talent I feel he lacks) while yet drifting further from his grip on reality.  As Whale's condition worsens he is plagued by flashbacks that have horrible effects on his mental state causing him to hallucinate and making his relationships with others somewhat unstable.  The tragic conclusion to the film involving the events leading up to Whale's suicide are completely engrossing and touching as they expose this man for who he really was, sad, alone and desperate.Lyn Redgrave does a wonderful job as Whale's long time housekeeper Hanna, giving the movie a sarcastic somewhat comedic edge, and Fraser, as I mentioned, played his part so wonderfully I was shocked I was watching that guy from the Mummy movies.

In this movie, Brendan Fraser gives one of his better acting perfomances. Ironically, Fraser's overall physique and head shape are some very striking physical features which happen to resemble Whale's Frankenstein monster. Lynn Redgrave (who you can barely recognize in her part) is cast as James Whale's annoyingly moralizing yet concerned caretaker (and she's just as annoying as the caretaker in the original Bride of Frankenstein)Initially, this movie is slow moving but it is no doubt, a thought and affect provoking film that provides some interesting and intriguing insights into man's fears, and the nature of intimacy, loneliness, love and human nature in general. By portraying Whale's experiences, Gods and Monsters also provides some excellent insights into Whale's movie themes and brings you behind the curtain into the Hollywood movie culture.The bright and vivid colors of the cinematography of this film are an ironic contrast to Whale's old B&W; horror movies and to his themes which generally involved the 'darker' or more 'taboo' sides of human nature and emotion.This is a cerebral drama. Gods and Monsters is a movie about genuine relationships rich in emotion and affect. It's likely to trigger your own strong emotional response.

504788,A1YQ6QB2127AJ4,B00000IQVD,David Anderson,"[1, 1]","The Oscar-winning ""Gods And Monsters"" is a highly compelling film released in 1998 starring Ian McKellen (""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy), Brendan Fraser (""Looney Toones"", 2003), and Lynn Redgrave.  It explores the last days of real-life director James Whale, the director of several films, the most famous being ""Bride of Frankenstein"".  Ironically, he was one of very few openly gay filmmakers in Hollywood at a time when the issue was never expressed.  The moments before his death, many major events happen in his personal life.  He befriends a handsome gardener who learns a lot about life through this.  Meanwhile, he suffers flashbacks from his days in World War II and his days on the set of ""Bride of Frankenstein"".  Through this journey the characters learn more about themselves than any other time.This story is told beautifully.  The flashbacks and the 1957 (their present) time are separated wonderfully, allowing audiences to slowly learn more about the characters and why they live in such turmoil.  This emotional story explores issues that give the communities a positive outlook: namely GLBT issues.  Therefore, this is a story about more than a former film director.  This is a story about passion, friendship, yearning, sickness, trauma, and life itself.  Everything combined leads to a powerful conclusion that will keep audiences thinking.  Such overall film substance, thanks to director and writer Bill Condon, gives great homage to the original Christopher Bram's novel version of ""Father of Frankenstein"".Ian McKellen and Lynn Redgrave received an Oscar nomination for their performances in this film (Best Actor/ Best Supporting Actress).  McKellen's portrayal of James Whale was expressed emotionally painful throughout the film, never losing his stance.  His dramatic expressions give this film a more powerful theme.  Brendan Fraser gives a powerful performance in this drama as the gardener.  Though he's better known to participate in comedies, he separates the two themes beautifully.  His acting quality is surprisingly better here than his comedies.  Though Redgrave's role as Whale's nanny is brief, she makes an unforgettable presence.  Her character's witty remarks are sometimes humorous.  Yet, they don't disrupt the overall dramatic theme.  Though the remaining cast performed well, this trio of actors stand out.Such overall film quality makes ""Gods And Monsters"" an unforgettable film that will surely please its audiences for a long time.

504791,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00000IQVD,D. Litton,"[77, 80]","At one point in &quot;Gods and Monsters,&quot; Ian McKellan's character, James Whale, gestures to his head and remarks, &quot;The real monsters are up here.&quot; The film spends its entire creating a way of life around this observation, portraying the last days of the well-known film director in ways that evoke humor, touching emotion, and above all else, emotionally haunting reflection on one's life.It's a most unusual film, not completely a biopic, yet not entirely fictional; it's more of a speculation on his latter days, based on the novel &quot;Father of Frankenstein,&quot; written by Christopher Bram. The reality of Whale's life, from his superior and delectable wit to the memories of war and Hollywood that delight and haunt him, is the basis of the novel and the film, as Whale relates them to a young gardener in whom he takes an emotional and physical interest.The story begins by introducing us to Whale's way of life, from his slowly deteriorating health and mental state, to his luxurious home, where he lives with his maid, Hanna (Lynn Redgrave), who is caring yet keeps up a stern demeanor when it comes to his dealings in homosexuality. The presence of the new gardener, Clay Boone (Brendan Fraser), strikes a chord within Whale, who resumes his sketching by asking the young ex-Marine to pose for his drawing, offering a face-only clause as a way of quelling Clay's obvious insecurities.The film's own openness with the issues of sexuality effectively portrays the flamboyance of its main character, who apparently saw no shame in his ways despite the resentment of homosexuality in the 1950's. The movie embodies this ignorance in Clay, who, at first, is unaware of his newfound friend's orientation. Once he discovers the truth from Hanna, his discomfort becomes even more unstable, to the point where he storms out in a rage of fury over the old man's excessive way with discomforting words. And yet, he returns to act as Whale's model, intrigued by the heartwarming and heartbreaking stories he offers as he sketches.This is a most fragile and unsteady friendship, yet in spite of the discomfort that surrounds their bond, their is a certain degree of comfort to be found within it. This stems from director Bill Condon's avoidance of character glorification: in &quot;Gods and Monsters,&quot; everyone has flaws. We see Whale's mood swings, his obsession with young boys in his old age, and his reluctance to recall his past; Clay also spends his time running, from his family, commitment, and stability. Ultimately, this makes their friendship mutually beneficial, allowing Clay a broader, richer view of life while allotting Whale the chance to face memories he would otherwise hide away forever.All of this is painted in broad strokes by Condon, who employs humor, wit, and sadness into his stunning adaptation. The discomfort that arises as a result of Clay's discovery of his friend's sexuality is handled lightly in earlier scenes, slowly gaining resonance and meaning as the plot moves along its dreamlike path. Whale's memories of filming the &quot;Frankenstein&quot; movies are realistic in their approach, while his recollections of war and his lost love are emotionally charged. All of this is given a slow yet mesmerizing pace that allows us into the deepest subconscious of the characters, so that we not only see what is going on in their minds, but can feel it as well.In the film's favor is its credible casting choices, most notably McKellan, who employs wit and real emotional range as Whale. Making sudden and drastic jumps from jubilant to unstable, McKellan's Whale is portrayed as someone whom we feel for, a man whose life is put into perspective in a manner that calls us to look at it with unblinking eyes. Fraser evokes a subtle sexual tension and eroticism as Clay, whose resemblance of Frankenstein's monster is the focal point of Whale's fascination. Redgrave makes a wonderful turn as Hanna, putting her wit and sarcasm to good use as the woman who embodies a maid, a wife, and a mother all at the same time.Above all else, the most perplexing aspect of &quot;Gods and Monsters&quot; is its connection to Whale's film, &quot;Frankenstein.&quot; Clay's resemblance and sense of naivety when in the presence of Whale is very much like the scene from that earlier film that this film's final scene. Seeing that final scene is to finally realize and acknowledge the film's purpose; it's one of those forceful moments in cinema that only come once in a blue moon. The film itself is a most touching achievement, deriving its success from its examination of Whale's life in a manner that makes it compelling rather than interesting.",5,"Powerfully acted, psychologically mesmerizing.",1010620800,"01 10, 2002",2002,4687,"['one', 'point', 'quot', 'Gods', 'Monsters', 'quot', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'character', 'James', 'Whale', 'head', 'remarks', 'quot', 'real', 'monsters', 'are', 'up', 'here.', 'quot', 'film', 'entire', 'creating', 'way', 'life', 'observation', 'portraying', 'last', 'days', 'well-known', 'film', 'director', 'ways', 'evoke', 'humor', 'touching', 'emotion', 'else', 'emotionally', 'haunting', 'reflection', 'one', 'life.It', 'most', 'unusual', 'film', 'not', 'completely', 'biopic', 'yet', 'not', 'entirely', 'fictional', 'more', 'speculation', 'latter', 'days', 'based', 'novel', 'quot', 'Father', 'Frankenstein', 'quot', 'written', 'Christopher', 'Bram', 'reality', 'Whale', 'life', 'superior', 'delectable', 'wit', 'memories', 'war', 'Hollywood', 'delight', 'haunt', 'basis', 'novel', 'film', 'Whale', 'young', 'gardener', 'whom', 'emotional', 'physical', 'interest.The', 'story', 'introducing', 'Whale', 'way', 'life', 'slowly', 'deteriorating', 'health', 'mental', 'state', 'luxurious', 'home', 'where', 'maid', 'Hanna', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'who', 'caring', 'yet', 'keeps', 'up', 'stern', 'demeanor', 'when', 'dealings', 'homosexuality', 'presence', 'new', 'gardener', 'Clay', 'Boone', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'chord', 'Whale', 'who', 'sketching', 'asking', 'young', 'ex-Marine', 'pose', 'drawing', 'offering', 'face-only', 'clause', 'way', 'quelling', 'Clay', 'obvious', 'insecurities.The', 'film', 'own', 'openness', 'issues', 'sexuality', 'effectively', 'flamboyance', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'apparently', 'saw', 'shame', 'ways', 'resentment', 'homosexuality', '1950', 'movie', 'ignorance', 'Clay', 'who', 'first', 'unaware', 'newfound', 'friend', 'orientation', 'Once', 'truth', 'Hanna', 'discomfort', 'even', 'more', 'unstable', 'point', 'where', 'out', 'rage', 'fury', 'old', 'man', 'excessive', 'way', 'discomforting', 'words', 'yet', 'act', 'Whale', 'model', 'intrigued', 'heartwarming', 'heartbreaking', 'stories', 'most', 'fragile', 'unsteady', 'friendship', 'yet', 'spite', 'discomfort', 'bond', 'certain', 'degree', 'comfort', 'be', 'found', 'director', 'Bill', 'Condon', 'avoidance', 'character', 'glorification', 'quot', 'Gods', 'Monsters', 'quot', 'everyone', 'flaws', 'see', 'Whale', 'mood', 'swings', 'obsession', 'young', 'boys', 'old', 'age', 'reluctance', 'recall', 'past', 'Clay', 'also', 'time', 'running', 'family', 'commitment', 'stability', 'Ultimately', 'friendship', 'mutually', 'beneficial', 'allowing', 'Clay', 'broader', 'richer', 'view', 'life', 'allotting', 'Whale', 'chance', 'face', 'memories', 'would', 'otherwise', 'hide', 'away', 'forever.All', 'painted', 'broad', 'strokes', 'Condon', 'who', 'humor', 'wit', 'sadness', 'stunning', 'adaptation', 'discomfort', 'result', 'Clay', 'discovery', 'friend', 'sexuality', 'handled', 'lightly', 'earlier', 'scenes', 'slowly', 'gaining', 'resonance', 'meaning', 'plot', 'dreamlike', 'path', 'Whale', 'memories', 'filming', 'quot', 'Frankenstein', 'quot', 'movies', 'are', 'realistic', 'approach', 'recollections', 'war', 'lost', 'love', 'are', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'given', 'slow', 'yet', 'mesmerizing', 'pace', 'deepest', 'subconscious', 'characters', 'not', 'only', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'minds', 'can', 'feel', 'film', 'favor', 'credible', 'casting', 'choices', 'most', 'notably', 'McKellan', 'who', 'wit', 'real', 'emotional', 'range', 'Whale', 'Making', 'sudden', 'drastic', 'jumps', 'jubilant', 'unstable', 'McKellan', 'Whale', 'portrayed', 'someone', 'whom', 'feel', 'man', 'life', 'put', 'perspective', 'manner', 'look', 'unblinking', 'eyes', 'Fraser', 'subtle', 'sexual', 'tension', 'eroticism', 'Clay', 'resemblance', 'Frankenstein', 'monster', 'focal', 'point', 'Whale', 'fascination', 'Redgrave', 'wonderful', 'turn', 'Hanna', 'putting', 'wit', 'sarcasm', 'good', 'use', 'woman', 'who', 'maid', 'wife', 'mother', 'same', 'else', 'most', 'perplexing', 'aspect', 'quot', 'Gods', 'Monsters', 'quot', 'connection', 'Whale', 'film', 'quot', 'Frankenstein.', 'quot', 'Clay', 'resemblance', 'sense', 'naivety', 'when', 'presence', 'Whale', 'very', 'much', 'scene', 'earlier', 'film', 'film', 'final', 'scene', 'Seeing', 'final', 'scene', 'finally', 'realize', 'acknowledge', 'film', 'purpose', 'one', 'forceful', 'moments', 'cinema', 'only', 'come', 'once', 'blue', 'moon', 'film', 'most', 'touching', 'achievement', 'deriving', 'success', 'examination', 'Whale', 'life', 'manner', 'compelling', 'rather', 'interesting']",N/A

504794,A3LEJ7UEJQDQNA,B00000IQVD,Eddy Oquendo,"[0, 0]","Director James Whale brought to life some of the most enduring cinematic images ever known. Every time that we see Frankenstein's Monster (flat head, neck conductors, etc.) we are touched with the creative vision of his  art. In this labor of love, Whales's life is depicted in a  semi-biographical light and his final days are displayed with the help of a  fictional friend. Flashes of his films and history are sprinkled about,  aiding character development here and filling out the story there.&quot;Gods and Monsters&quot; is a work that entertains us with humor (I  laughed out loud several times) while peppering us with serious ideas --  perceptions of homosexuality, encroaching age, impending death, unrealized  dreams, etc. It all moves at a leisurely pace, but it never seems to be  quite slow. The movie will occasionaly cause discomfort for heterosexual  males, but there is often a humorous edge to these moments. Unfortunately,  the picture will likely provoke disgust and disdain among those with  inordinately homophobic leanings.This is a high quality film delivered  by several key persons that have a great interest in its subject matter. It  is excellently directed and beautifully photographed. Ian McKellen and Lynn  Redgrave are superb in their roles, rendering humor, drama, and poignancy  throughout. As lead actor and supporting actress, they were justifiably  nominated for &quot;Oscars&quot; at the 1998 Academy Awards. Brendan  Frasier, while not up to the level of his older colleagues, performs  admirably. Not to be overlooked is the haunting (no pun intended) score  that is enjoyable for its own sake and matches the mood of the film  perfectly. Although devotees of the horror classics, and Whale fans in  particular, are the most obvious candidates for purchase of this movie, it  has enough merits to warrant viewing by any serious film-lover.The DVD  version of this movie boasts strong picture quality that does justice the  the considerable efforts of the cinematographer. The sound is good, and  doesn't particularly suffer from the fact that the disc is only recorded in  &quot;Dolby Surround&quot;. Among other things, the special features  include an enjoyable and informative James Whale documentary, and an  adequate director commentary. If you've enjoyed this film and are  considering purchase of the DVD, you won't be disappointed with its  qualities. Never seen it? In that case, rent it.

Every review centers on that aspect.  If this had been between a man and a woman and the theme was identical, would it make it any better or worse.  This is a human story, about lonliness and last days of life, not a happy topic I admit.  If you remove the local and drop Ian and Brendan in any other setting and have them perform, it would still be an amazing movie.  James Whale is handled with empathy by Sir Ian. Mr. Frazier shows he can act...in fact this is the only movie in which he shows this and it is truly a shame. Who knew he ever had talent other than acting like an idiot. Hollywood has missed the boat with Mr. Frazier's ability.  The chemistry between the two men comes out of the screen.  Yes, this movie is a bit slow, but this is not an action film, it is not meant to be. Not to be overlooked is Lynn Redgrave. She does play the character a bit over the top, but it creates a great balance to the bleakness in both male charcters lives. The final scene between Whale and Clay is nothing short of ""heart stopping"", not because Frazier is naked, but because of the way it unfolds.  The emotionals are raw and real...and you feel it.This is one of my favorite films, superbly written, directed and acted.

So far as I can tell, $10m was allotted to film it, and it raked in a whopping $6m at the box-office.Well, so what.  As Ezra Pound wisely commented about books, many years ago, ""Pay no attention to literary prizes, not even the Nobel."" And how wise his words were!  So I regard the fact that this film won an Oscar for its screenplay as nice, but not thrilling.It is not hard to see why the film failed at the box-office.  There are no car chases, no explosions, no good-looking babes removing their wet T-shirts: it is very far from being a film for ""Joe Six-Pack,"" as another trenchant reviewer pointed out.What it is, is a masterpiece.  I doubt that I will ever see Ian McKellen give a better performance -- unless I win the lottery and can travel to England for a live performance!  :-)  But, much more interesting than that, is the simple fact that the entire film is superbly acted, from the first frame to the last.  There is not a bad performance in the lot; more surprisingly, there is not even a weak performance!I found the story to be extremely moving and involving -- approximately a hundred times more interesting than the clumsy mechanics on display in ""Brokeback Mountain.""  It is a movie with a gay theme...well, no.  Let's say more than that: it is the story of an old man, James Whale, who is utterly and completely gay.

This overwhelming, unbearable reality is dealt with while two other people observe, take part, and try to help: his long-time maid, and his handsome gardener.

Frequently, this fascination causes us to forget that someone was directing these movies. Only a small handful of Directors ever get the attention that we focus on the stars. This movie focuses on one.James Whale directed many movies but the two that put him on the map were Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein. This movie focuses on the last weeks of his life. Prior to the beginning of the movie he has had a stroke. While Whale has made a complete recovery physically the stroke has affected his brain. He is beginning to have flashbacks of his younger years and loves. Memories that he may be happier not remembering. We discover that Whale may have been hounded out of the elite of Hollywood over a sex scandal. You see, while it is acknowledged that there are homosexuals in Hollywood, it has always been something that people don't want to have flaunted in front of them. Whale didn't care what people thought and seemed to have many wild parties at his house.Whale begins a strange relationship with a young gardener that has recently begun to work for him. The gardener, Clayton Boone, is a strapping young man who is searching for something in his life. The two's relationship grows as each begins to find more of what they are missing from the other until the final explosive night.Ian McKellen is James Whale. Mainstream American audiences haven't seen much of McKellen over his long career. That will soon pass as McKellen has been signed as Magneto in the upcoming X-Men film. All who have seen him find McKellen to be a phenomenal actor and richly deserving of all the awards that have come his way. The surprise to some in this movie will be the man who plays Clayton Boone, Brendan Fraser. Mainstream audiences are used to Fraser in movies such as Encino Man and George of the Jungle. While exceedingly funny movies, they don't show his acting ability to the fullest. This role does. Fraser is with McKellen step for step all the way through expressing surprise that this famous man wants to spend time with him and then coming to a greater understanding of himself.This is a very powerful movie. Some will not like it because of the blatant homosexual references throughout but to allay this fear it is for the most part not graphic in this depiction. The movie is well directed and the acting by all is wonderful!",4,brendan fraser is surprisingly good,1017187200,"03 27, 2002",2002,2571,"['society', 'enamored', 'Hollywood', 'tend', 'focus', 'most', 'interest', 'people', 'who', 'star', 'movies', 'What', 'actors', 'actresses', 'are', 'up', 'keeps', 'constantly', 'scanning', 'news', 'shows', 'legitimate', 'periodicals', 'tabloids', 'Frequently', 'fascination', 'forget', 'someone', 'was', 'directing', 'movies', 'Only', 'small', 'handful', 'Directors', 'ever', 'get', 'attention', 'focus', 'stars', 'movie', 'one.James', 'Whale', 'directed', 'many', 'movies', 'two', 'put', 'map', 'were', 'Frankenstein', 'Bride', 'Frankenstein', 'movie', 'last', 'weeks', 'life', 'Prior', 'beginning', 'movie', 'had', 'stroke', 'Whale', 'made', 'complete', 'recovery', 'physically', 'stroke', 'affected', 'brain', 'beginning', 'have', 'flashbacks', 'younger', 'years', 'loves', 'Memories', 'may', 'be', 'happier', 'not', 'remembering', 'discover', 'Whale', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'hounded', 'elite', 'Hollywood', 'sex', 'scandal', 'see', 'acknowledged', 'are', 'homosexuals', 'Hollywood', 'always', 'been', 'something', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'flaunted', 'front', 'Whale', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'people', 'thought', 'seemed', 'have', 'many', 'wild', 'parties', 'house.Whale', 'strange', 'relationship', 'young', 'gardener', 'recently', 'begun', 'work', 'gardener', 'Clayton', 'Boone', 'strapping', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'searching', 'something', 'life', 'two', 'relationship', 'find', 'more', 'what', 'are', 'missing', 'other', 'final', 'explosive', 'night.Ian', 'McKellen', 'James', 'Whale', 'Mainstream', 'American', 'audiences', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'much', 'McKellen', 'long', 'career', 'will', 'soon', 'pass', 'McKellen', 'been', 'signed', 'Magneto', 'upcoming', 'X-Men', 'film', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'find', 'McKellen', 'be', 'phenomenal', 'actor', 'richly', 'deserving', 'awards', 'have', 'come', 'way', 'surprise', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'man', 'who', 'Clayton', 'Boone', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'Mainstream', 'audiences', 'are', 'used', 'Fraser', 'movies', 'such', 'Encino', 'Man', 'George', 'Jungle', 'exceedingly', 'funny', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'acting', 'ability', 'fullest', 'role', 'Fraser', 'McKellen', 'step', 'step', 'way', 'expressing', 'surprise', 'famous', 'man', 'spend', 'time', 'then', 'coming', 'greater', 'understanding', 'himself.This', 'very', 'powerful', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'blatant', 'homosexual', 'references', 'allay', 'fear', 'most', 'part', 'not', 'graphic', 'depiction', 'movie', 'well', 'directed', 'acting', 'wonderful']",N/A

Based on the novel by Christopher Braum, FATHER OF FRANKENSTEIN, and directed by Bill Condon (winner of an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay), GODS AND MONSTERS is the fictionalized account of the last days of James Whale-- ""Mr. Jimmy"" to his doting houskeeper played brilliantly by Lynn Redgrave-- who made the original FRANKENSTEIN and other Hollywood movies. Although the plot is rather thin at times, the acting is superb. Ian McKellen as the ailing but still dapper Whale has not lost his eye for attractive men and is still handsome in his silks, wools and tweeds. Brendan Fraser as the yard man gets so into his role that you can almost smell his sweat; but Lynn Redgrave as the housekeeper is simply wonderful. She is totally in character-- just watch her at any given moment-- and should have won an Oscar for this performance instead of another fine British actress Judi Dench who won that year for Best Supporting Actress. With another director and other, lesser actors, this film could have degenerated into another tasteless story of a sad, aging homosexual. But it did not. It is rife with both humor and pathos.

504822,A22G6XU1L486N3,B00000IQVD,"Lionel Bourg ""Rock and Roll Gypsy""","[0, 0]","GODS AND MONSTERS(1998)---Sir Ian McKellen, Brendan Fraser, Lynn Redgrave, Lolita Davidovich, David Dukes, Kevin J. O'Conner.This film is based on Christopher Bram's fictionalized novel about James Whale, the English director who made FRANKENSTEIN; BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN; THE OLD DARK HOUSE; and THE INVISIBLE MAN, among other films. Although not a true biography of Whale, the film is historically accurate in many respects. We learn that Whale was born to poor, lower-class parents(a fact which deeply affected him as an adult), that he served in WWI(the horror of which was something else that left an indelible mark on him), that he began his career in the theater and had an enormous stage success with the play, ""Journey's End"", which resulted in his being summoned to Hollywood to direct films, and that he was openly homosexual at a time in Hollywood when doing so could be disastrous for one's career---his long-time ""companion"" was David Lewis, who had a successful career as a producer---first at MGM, then at Warner Bros.---among the films he produced/co-produced were: RIFFRAFF; CAMILLE; ALL THIS AND HEAVEN TOO; KING'S ROW; IN THIS OUR LIFE; and RAINTREE COUNTY.Sir Ian McKellen was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of Whale and he is wonderful to watch in this film. Fraser plays a young ex-Marine who works as Whale's gardener and Redgrave plays Whale's devoted, but devoutly Catholic, housekeeper who fears for his salvation due to his homosexuality. Among Whale's avocations is painting and he asks Fraser if he would agree to let him paint his portrait in return for being paid to do so. Aware of his sexual orientation, Fraser agrees but makes it clear that he won't do any of that ""nude stuff"". Whale suffers a stroke(historically true) which leaves him physically unaffected but affects his mind so that he begins to have flashbacks to events from his past, primarily from WWI. Over time, McKellen and Fraser develop a friendship and we learn much that is historically true about the making of some of Whale's classic horror films and the sexual proclivities of some other famous Hollywood figures(most prominently, director George Cukor, who was a ""closet homosexual"").As Whale's flashbacks become more frequent, his doctors confirm that he will eventually sink into a ""mental twilight"", unable to live in the ""present"". In the climactic scene of the film, Whale pours out his terror of losing his mind and not being able to do anything creative---even paint. In an attempt to comfort his friend, Fraser agrees to let Whale paint him in the nude, but stresses that there is to be no ""hanky-panky"". Whale begins to suffer one of his flashbacks and begins to think that Fraser is the young lover he met while serving in the trenches. He begins to try and make love to Fraser, who becomes angry and throws Whale to the floor, bringing him back to reality. Whale is horribly embarrassed, begs his forgiveness, and assures him that nothing like that will ever happen again. The next morning, Fraser discovers Whale's lifeless body floating in the swimming pool---a suicide who can't live with the thought of losing his mind. Whale's body was found in his pool in 1957 and was ruled a suicide.I think this is a wonderful film---by turns funny, informative, and deeply moving. In addition to McKellen's superb performance, both Fraser and Redgrave are completely convincing in their roles and the cinematography is beautiful.

It is taken from Christopher Bram's speculative novel, &quot;The Father of Frankenstein&quot;. Most famous for the two original films about  the creation of life (seen as 'monsters'), Whale was found floating in his  swimming pool. Officially called a suicide, the circumstances were  questionable. Whale was gay in a time when Hollywood, at its most  image-conscious and hypocritical, shunned any association with a lifestyle  that suffused the industry. &quot;Gods and Monsters&quot; is a sensitive  and substantial portrait of two men. Jim, played with elegance, poignancy,  and humor by Ian McKellan, has had a stroke and is suffering the  indignities of impaired functions and mental state. It is anathema for the  formerly vigorous and humorous man to contemplate a future of declining  health and increasing dependence. Jim befriends his hunky gardener, Clay  Boone. Brendan Fraser is outstanding, as well as sweet and desireable, in  the role. The roughly handsome young man models for Jim, preferably  shirtless, and they talk. Lonely individualists with secret heartaches, the  two men form an intimate, affectionate, and combative bond. Whale wistfully  and painfully remembers, in haunting flashbacks, his youth, career, and  tragic love for a young soldier in the ghastly trenches of WWI (learning  first-hand the 'gallows' humor he brought to his films). These memories  become increasingly mixed up with his relationship to Clay, who he begins  to confuse with his 'monster'. The younger man, with honor and compassion,  sticks by Whale till the end, and remembers his friend in a touching  epilogue. This is a loving tribute to a man who contributed to, profited  from, and was ultimately &quot;killed&quot; by a heartless studio system.",4,sensitive portrait,955670400,"04 14, 2000",2000,1833,"['film', 'reconstruction', 'director', 'James', 'Whale', 'last', 'days', 'thoughts', 'taken', 'Christopher', 'Bram', 'speculative', 'novel', 'quot', 'Father', 'Frankenstein', 'quot', 'Most', 'famous', 'two', 'original', 'films', 'creation', 'life', 'seen', ""'monsters"", 'Whale', 'was', 'found', 'floating', 'swimming', 'pool', 'Officially', 'called', 'suicide', 'circumstances', 'were', 'questionable', 'Whale', 'was', 'gay', 'time', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'image-conscious', 'hypocritical', 'shunned', 'association', 'lifestyle', 'suffused', 'industry', 'quot', 'Gods', 'Monsters', 'quot', 'sensitive', 'substantial', 'portrait', 'two', 'men', 'Jim', 'played', 'elegance', 'poignancy', 'humor', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'had', 'stroke', 'suffering', 'indignities', 'impaired', 'functions', 'mental', 'state', 'anathema', 'formerly', 'vigorous', 'humorous', 'man', 'contemplate', 'future', 'declining', 'health', 'increasing', 'dependence', 'Jim', 'hunky', 'gardener', 'Clay', 'Boone', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'outstanding', 'as', 'well', 'sweet', 'desireable', 'role', 'roughly', 'handsome', 'young', 'man', 'models', 'Jim', 'preferably', 'shirtless', 'talk', 'Lonely', 'individualists', 'secret', 'heartaches', 'two', 'men', 'form', 'intimate', 'affectionate', 'combative', 'bond', 'Whale', 'wistfully', 'painfully', 'remembers', 'haunting', 'flashbacks', 'youth', 'career', 'tragic', 'love', 'young', 'soldier', 'ghastly', 'trenches', 'WWI', 'learning', 'first-hand', ""'gallows"", 'humor', 'brought', 'films', 'memories', 'become', 'increasingly', 'mixed', 'up', 'relationship', 'Clay', 'who', 'confuse', ""'monster"", 'younger', 'man', 'honor', 'compassion', 'sticks', 'Whale', 'till', 'end', 'remembers', 'friend', 'touching', 'epilogue', 'loving', 'tribute', 'man', 'who', 'contributed', 'profited', 'was', 'ultimately', 'quot', 'killed', 'quot', 'heartless', 'studio', 'system']",N/A
504827,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B00000IQVD,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[2, 3]","The 1998 film ""Gods and Monsters"" is a thought-provoking film that speculates on the final days of an early Hollywood film director named James Whale (1889-1957), who had directed two classic Hollywood monster films: ""Frankenstein"" (1931) and ""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935).  Portrayed by the brilliant actor Ian McKellan (best known for his portrayal of the character Gandalf in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy between 2001 and 2003, as well as the character Magneto in the ""X-Men"" films of 2000 and 2003), James Whale lived a relatively solitary life in his later years, except for the companionship of his housekeeper Hanna (Lynn Redgrave).  James Whale was also gay and found his new gardener, Clayton Boone (Brendan Fraser), quite attractive.  After talking with Clayton, James was able to convince Clayton to model for him, as James was also an artist.  However, James was always reluctant to show Clayton what he had drawn.  Not being gay himself, Clayton didn't always feel comfortable around James; but the relationship that developed between them was one of mutual.  Clayton was interested in James' stories about his early Hollywood years, as well as his military career during World War I, and James even invited Clayton to go with him to a posh Hollywood party.  Unfortunately, James was not as healthy as he wanted to be (having survived a stroke).  This became an increasingly pressing issue for him as time passed, but he had not shared this issue with Clayton until an intensely emotional night.To its credit, ""Gods and Monsters"" won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium.  Ian McKellan received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor and Lynn Redgrave received a nomination for Best Supporting Actress.  With a fascinating cast of characters, wonderful acting and an engaging plot, I rate ""Gods and Monsters"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  Other memorable characters include Edmund Kay (Jack Plotnick), Boris Karloff (Jack Betts), Princess Margaret (Cornelia Hayes O'Herlihy), and the young James Whale (Brandon Kleyla).",5,"""He's never met a princess before, only queens.""",1120435200,"07 4, 2005",2005,2079,"['1998', 'film', 'Gods', 'Monsters', 'thought-provoking', 'film', 'final', 'days', 'early', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'director', 'named', 'James', 'Whale', '1889-1957', 'who', 'had', 'directed', 'two', 'classic', 'Hollywood', 'monster', 'films', 'Frankenstein', '1931', 'Bride', 'Frankenstein', '1935', 'Portrayed', 'brilliant', 'actor', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'best', 'known', 'portrayal', 'character', 'Gandalf', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', '2001', '2003', 'as', 'well', 'character', 'Magneto', 'X-Men', 'films', '2000', '2003', 'James', 'Whale', 'lived', 'relatively', 'solitary', 'life', 'later', 'years', 'companionship', 'housekeeper', 'Hanna', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'James', 'Whale', 'was', 'also', 'gay', 'found', 'new', 'gardener', 'Clayton', 'Boone', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'quite', 'attractive', 'talking', 'Clayton', 'James', 'was', 'able', 'convince', 'Clayton', 'model', 'James', 'was', 'also', 'artist', 'However', 'James', 'was', 'always', 'reluctant', 'show', 'Clayton', 'what', 'had', 'drawn', 'Not', 'being', 'gay', 'Clayton', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'James', 'relationship', 'developed', 'was', 'one', 'mutual', 'Clayton', 'was', 'interested', 'James', 'stories', 'early', 'Hollywood', 'years', 'as', 'well', 'military', 'career', 'World', 'War', 'James', 'even', 'invited', 'Clayton', 'go', 'posh', 'Hollywood', 'party', 'Unfortunately', 'James', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'healthy', 'wanted', 'be', 'having', 'survived', 'stroke', 'became', 'increasingly', 'pressing', 'issue', 'time', 'passed', 'had', 'not', 'shared', 'issue', 'Clayton', 'intensely', 'emotional', 'night.To', 'credit', 'Gods', 'Monsters', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Writing', 'Screenplay', 'Based', 'Material', 'Medium', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'received', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'fascinating', 'cast', 'characters', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'engaging', 'plot', 'rate', 'Gods', 'Monsters', 'resounding', '5', '5', 'stars', 'Other', 'memorable', 'characters', 'include', 'Edmund', 'Kay', 'Jack', 'Plotnick', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'Jack', 'Betts', 'Princess', 'Margaret', 'Cornelia', 'Hayes', ""O'Herlihy"", 'young', 'James', 'Whale', 'Brandon', 'Kleyla']",N/A

Condon write the screenplay, which was based on Christopher Bram's novel &quot;Father of Frankenstein.&quot; The film is a fictionalized account of the latter days in the life of James Whale, the gay filmmaker who directed such classics as &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Bride of Frankenstein.&quot;As Whale (played by Ian McKellen) copes with a degenerative brain condition, he strikes up a friendship with his heterosexual yard worker (Brendan Fraser). Condon deftly blends together scenes from this relationship with Whale's memories of World War I, recreations of behind-the-scenes action on the set of &quot;Bride of Frankenstein,&quot; and other images from Whale's increasingly tormented mind.McKellen is superb in his challenging role: at times delightfully sly and witty, at times torn with lust or despair, Whale is an unforgettable figure. Fraser is also excellent. And Lynn Redgrave is similarly memorable in her role as Whale's devoted housekeeper (who nonetheless disapproves of his &quot;bugger&quot; lifestyle). The film's production values and additional performances are excellent; I was particularly impressed by the recreation of the set of &quot;Bride.&quot; And Carter Burwell's moody, elegant musical score really helps to unify and elevate the film as a whole.&quot;G&amp;M&quot; contains some delicious comic moments.

Whale is, of course, best known today for his films like FRANKENSTEIN, THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, and THE INVISIBLE MAN.  When Whale quit directing at the peak of his career in the late 1930s, he retired to a somewhat reclusive but comfortable life at his California estate.  Nearly two decades later, he was found dead in his swimming pool, and though ruled a suicide, the circumstances of his death have never been satisfactorily resolved.  GODS AND MONSTERS seeks to recount those last days of Whale's life by filling in the factual gaps with informed speculation, and the result is a gripping and well-acted drama that won the 1998 Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay.As the openly gay and artistically effete director James Whale, Ian McKellen delivers an Oscar-calibre performance (he was nominated but did not win).  McKellen, himself candidly homosexual, plays the role with strong insight and conviction.  Unafraid to show Whale's weaknesses as well as strengths, he adequately evokes the pathos necessary to make Whale a character that even the homophobes in the audience can learn to care about.  Brendan Fraser also gives an affecting performances as Whale's heterosexual and rough-around-the-edges gardener Clay Boone.  Though the character Clay is himself homophobic, he eventually develops a more-or-less platonic friendship with Whale and learns to value certain aspects of Whale's world view.  Also of note is the appearance of Lynn Redgrave, who delivers an over-the-top--and Oscar nominated--performance as Whale's ultraconservative and disapproving housekeeper.Aficionados of the horror genre are likely to delight in the numerous clips from Whale's THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, as well as the excellent reenactments of certain events involved in the creation of that film.  (It is THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, as any horror fan can tell you, from which the title GODS AND MONSTERS is drawn.)  Buffs should also enjoy the fictional account of a chance dinner-party reunion of Whale and his &quot;monsters&quot; Boris Karloff and Elsa Lanchester.Carter Burwell's musical score for GODS AND MONSTERS is truly one of the most beautiful and haunting works from the contemporary cinema.  It is at times  soothing or melancholy, while at other times it is eerie, mysterious, and even downright spooky.  In another era, Burwell's music would have just as easily worked for THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN or THE INVISIBLE MAN.But a word of caution is in order.  In spite of all its good qualities, GODS AND MONSTERS is not the type of film that will appeal to all audiences.  If you are a person who is easily offended by blatant allusions to the gay lifestyle or homosexual practices, certain bits of dialogue and a few scenes here and there are likely to disturb or upset you.  On the other hand, if you are not homophobic and are tolerant of the depiction of alternate lifestyles in the cinema, you may find this film to be an affecting theatrical experience.",5,The Last Days of the Father of Frankenstein,1005523200,"11 12, 2001",2001,3176,"['Based', 'intriguing', 'novel', 'FATHER', 'OF', 'FRANKENSTEIN', 'Christopher', 'Bram', 'GODS', 'AND', 'MONSTERS', 'excellent', 'character', 'study', 'final', 'weeks', 'life', 'famed', '1930s-era', 'film', 'director', 'James', 'Whale', 'Whale', 'course', 'best', 'known', 'today', 'films', 'FRANKENSTEIN', 'THE', 'BRIDE', 'OF', 'FRANKENSTEIN', 'THE', 'INVISIBLE', 'MAN', 'When', 'Whale', 'quit', 'directing', 'peak', 'career', 'late', '1930s', 'retired', 'somewhat', 'reclusive', 'comfortable', 'life', 'California', 'estate', 'Nearly', 'two', 'decades', 'later', 'was', 'found', 'dead', 'swimming', 'pool', 'ruled', 'suicide', 'circumstances', 'death', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'satisfactorily', 'resolved', 'GODS', 'MONSTERS', 'recount', 'last', 'days', 'Whale', 'life', 'filling', 'factual', 'gaps', 'informed', 'speculation', 'result', 'gripping', 'well-acted', 'drama', 'won', '1998', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay.As', 'openly', 'gay', 'artistically', 'effete', 'director', 'James', 'Whale', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Oscar-calibre', 'performance', 'was', 'nominated', 'did', 'not', 'win', 'McKellen', 'candidly', 'homosexual', 'role', 'strong', 'insight', 'conviction', 'Unafraid', 'show', 'Whale', 'weaknesses', 'as', 'well', 'strengths', 'adequately', 'pathos', 'necessary', 'make', 'Whale', 'character', 'even', 'homophobes', 'audience', 'can', 'learn', 'care', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'also', 'affecting', 'performances', 'Whale', 'heterosexual', 'rough-around-the-edges', 'gardener', 'Clay', 'Boone', 'character', 'Clay', 'homophobic', 'eventually', 'more-or-less', 'platonic', 'friendship', 'Whale', 'value', 'certain', 'aspects', 'Whale', 'world', 'view', 'Also', 'note', 'appearance', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'who', 'over-the-top', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performance', 'Whale', 'ultraconservative', 'disapproving', 'housekeeper.Aficionados', 'horror', 'genre', 'are', 'likely', 'delight', 'numerous', 'clips', 'Whale', 'THE', 'BRIDE', 'OF', 'FRANKENSTEIN', 'as', 'well', 'excellent', 'reenactments', 'certain', 'events', 'involved', 'creation', 'film', 'THE', 'BRIDE', 'OF', 'FRANKENSTEIN', 'horror', 'fan', 'can', 'tell', 'title', 'GODS', 'AND', 'MONSTERS', 'drawn', 'Buffs', 'should', 'also', 'enjoy', 'fictional', 'account', 'chance', 'dinner-party', 'reunion', 'Whale', 'quot', 'monsters', 'quot', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'Elsa', 'Lanchester.Carter', 'Burwell', 'musical', 'score', 'GODS', 'AND', 'MONSTERS', 'truly', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'haunting', 'works', 'contemporary', 'cinema', 'times', 'soothing', 'melancholy', 'other', 'times', 'eerie', 'mysterious', 'even', 'downright', 'spooky', 'era', 'Burwell', 'music', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'easily', 'worked', 'THE', 'BRIDE', 'OF', 'FRANKENSTEIN', 'THE', 'INVISIBLE', 'MAN.But', 'word', 'caution', 'order', 'spite', 'good', 'qualities', 'GODS', 'AND', 'MONSTERS', 'not', 'type', 'film', 'will', 'appeal', 'audiences', 'are', 'person', 'who', 'easily', 'offended', 'blatant', 'allusions', 'gay', 'lifestyle', 'homosexual', 'practices', 'certain', 'bits', 'dialogue', 'few', 'scenes', 'here', 'are', 'likely', 'disturb', 'upset', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'not', 'homophobic', 'are', 'tolerant', 'depiction', 'alternate', 'lifestyles', 'cinema', 'may', 'find', 'film', 'be', 'affecting', 'theatrical', 'experience']",N/A

James Whale was a great director at Universal that created the horror genre and most remembered for his films Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, The Invisible Man and Show Boat with Irene Dunne.  And he was openly gay.Ian McKellan plays Whale and Lynn Redgrave his devoted servant Hannah.  In the film, they have added a character of Boone (Brenden Frasier).  Boone is a gardener and cuts the lawn at Whale's estate.  Boone also represents an alter ego of the Frankenstein monster (including a hair cut that resembles a flat top.)The film takes place during the final years of Whale's life.  He has had a couple of minor strokes that disrupts his thought filters.  Therefore, little things make is mind wander to other times.  The film floats from the present to Whale's childhood to the filming of Bride of Frankenstein.Whale becomes infatuated with Boone, not sexually but as the personification of the his creature.  He starts by drawing them, then he befriends him.  Boone cannot understand this platonic relationship but accepts it.  The film ends with Whale's drowning death.Ian McKellan and Lynn Redgrave give master classes in acting and both received Oscar nomination - both should have won.

504833,A3DYIGOLWS5CNS,B00000IQVD,Niel Rishoi,"[0, 0]","Amazing that such a great film could be made for only 3 million.Bill Condon directs with elegant simplicity, thoroughly allowing the viewer to revel in the dynamics of the story and in the development and playing out of the characterizations. This is a film which allows us to become immersed in the depth and richness of the very real human beings which inhabit this poignant, affecting story. No cheap melodramatic or pat resolutions here; everything looms unerringly real and on a believable human level.  It helps of course that Condon has the actors to do it justice. Sir Ian McKellen faultlessly establishes Whale's persona; the nuances and facial expressions are revealing of a whole myriad of emotions, thoughts and feelings. He brings such a charge, such a presence, he almost doesn't need words, and yet, there is no discernible &quot;technique&quot; at play, no self-concious &quot;actory&quot; mannerisms.  We are aware of something extraordinary here, a  near-transference of another's persona into McKellen's own. He takes us to places in a way that Olivier once did. Lynn Redgrave is fixating as Hannah, the completely off-the-wall yet endearing servant.  Redgrave is always careful never to let schtick mar what could be a caricature of this severely limited character; one can see a real person behind the granite wall of unimaginative denial.  Brendan Fraser is the film's most pleasant surprise. Redgrave in the Special Features section of the DVD says of Fraser, &quot;He's a real actor,&quot; and this is certainly borne out in the finished result.  With a powerhouse of artistic sagacity like McKellan, many a young actor could threaten to flounder helplessly, but Fraser not only holds his own astonishingly, he matches Sir Ian scene for scene. Most impressively, Fraser as his character appears to be paying rapt attention when McKellan's Whale speaks. His reactions are spontaneous and natural, the timing  impeccably established. Moreover, Fraser declines to merely play the brooding hunk. When McKellan attacks Fraser's character in lascivious desperation, Fraser's depiction of his horror, trauma, outrage and pain is flinchingly palpable. It does not hurt either than Fraser is physically believable as the object of Whale's attraction.Don't miss this absorbing masterpiece.",5,"Absorbing, deeply affecting masterpiece",1064188800,"09 22, 2003",2003,2303,"['Amazing', 'great', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'only', '3', 'million.Bill', 'Condon', 'directs', 'elegant', 'simplicity', 'thoroughly', 'allowing', 'viewer', 'revel', 'dynamics', 'story', 'development', 'playing', 'characterizations', 'film', 'become', 'immersed', 'depth', 'richness', 'very', 'real', 'human', 'beings', 'inhabit', 'poignant', 'affecting', 'story', 'cheap', 'melodramatic', 'pat', 'resolutions', 'here', 'everything', 'unerringly', 'real', 'believable', 'human', 'level', 'course', 'Condon', 'actors', 'do', 'justice', 'Sir', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'faultlessly', 'Whale', 'persona', 'nuances', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'revealing', 'whole', 'myriad', 'emotions', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'charge', 'presence', 'almost', ""n't"", 'need', 'words', 'yet', 'discernible', 'quot', 'technique', 'quot', 'play', 'self-concious', 'quot', 'actory', 'quot', 'mannerisms', 'are', 'aware', 'something', 'extraordinary', 'here', 'near-transference', 'persona', 'McKellen', 'own', 'places', 'way', 'Olivier', 'once', 'did', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'fixating', 'Hannah', 'completely', 'off-the-wall', 'yet', 'endearing', 'servant', 'Redgrave', 'always', 'careful', 'never', 'let', 'schtick', 'mar', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'caricature', 'severely', 'limited', 'character', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'real', 'person', 'granite', 'wall', 'unimaginative', 'denial', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'film', 'most', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Redgrave', 'Special', 'Features', 'section', 'DVD', 'Fraser', 'quot', 'real', 'actor', 'quot', 'certainly', 'borne', 'out', 'finished', 'result', 'powerhouse', 'artistic', 'sagacity', 'McKellan', 'many', 'young', 'actor', 'could', 'threaten', 'flounder', 'helplessly', 'Fraser', 'not', 'only', 'own', 'astonishingly', 'Sir', 'Ian', 'scene', 'scene', 'Most', 'impressively', 'Fraser', 'character', 'be', 'paying', 'rapt', 'attention', 'when', 'McKellan', 'Whale', 'speaks', 'reactions', 'are', 'spontaneous', 'natural', 'timing', 'impeccably', 'established', 'Moreover', 'Fraser', 'merely', 'play', 'brooding', 'hunk', 'When', 'McKellan', 'Fraser', 'character', 'lascivious', 'desperation', 'Fraser', 'depiction', 'horror', 'trauma', 'outrage', 'pain', 'flinchingly', 'palpable', 'not', 'hurt', 'either', 'Fraser', 'physically', 'believable', 'object', 'Whale', 'attraction.Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'absorbing', 'masterpiece']",N/A
504834,A1TRWW665ACYQ3,B00000IQVD,n.m.,"[3, 4]","This film achieves to the fullest extent what it set out to do; To present a portrait of a man during the final stages of his life, and all which that implies. The man in question is no other than legendary Hollywood director, James Whale, who his most famous for doing FRANKENSTEIN. But the film is never really just about James Whale. We don't meet Whale the director, we meet Whale the person, and as I was watching the film I continously thought to myself that this could be any person; We're watching a man who knows that his time here on earth is nearly up, and not a film that just tries to give a biographical account of James Whale's life. The man in question just happens to be James Whale.A problem with biographical films is that they're often too much in awe of the person they depict. GODS AND MONSTERS never attempts to glorify James Whale. We see him through his pros and cons; Clearly he was a genious at what he did and that can't be denied, but he was also at times very selfish and brute, and Bill Condon (the director of the film) doesn't censor these aspects of Whale's character. Again this brings out the person in James Whale and not the director.Sir Ian McKellen is brilliant! He stars as the now retired James Whale, who is living out his final years at his estate, far from the buzzing life of Hollywood. In his house he resides with a small crew of servants, most notably an old housekeeper (Lynn Redgrave gives a great performance) and a newly hired young and handsome gardener, Clayton Boon (Brendan Frasier). James Whale was one of the few celebrities at that time that was openly homosexual, and the film focuses on the relationship between Whale and Boone.Bill Condon has also taken extensive use of the flashback-technique, to show how the past has a way of catching up with an old man.GODS AND MONSTERS is such a tremendous achievement that any attempt at describing it with words seems to fall short. I *loved* this film. It's one of those few films where you stop thinking of photography and directing and music and lighting and editing, and all that, and instead just immerse yourself in the film. It's a fantastic feeling when that happens! When film becomes escapism.

This is the one to watch.Here Ian McKellen possibly does his best performance to date (Yes, it is better than Gandalf but not by much!) and so does Brendan Fraser. So two actors have their best roles ever in this movie and that says a lot about the quality of this film. This one has also got a few Oscars, even though that might not say much, it is still quite an achievement given that this film is pretty much a medium budget movie with limited locations and sets.The story is about the director James Whale who was primarily a horror director in the 1930s and 1940s. This is the story about the perils of old age, sexual discrimination, lust, anger, manipulation and love - all played out to the tune of a film that documents the reasons for this director's status as one of the all time greats.McKellen is frighteningly real at times. He has an old-age seizure on camera that looks stunningly realistic. The man is an impeccable performer and takes on his role here like a bull by the horns. You feel sadness and grossness for him at the same time. He is a manipulator, a conman, a sexual deviant- but also a great heart. Strangely enough this film has similar themes as Lord of the Rings. Tolken wrote many of the battle scenes, especially the Dead Marshes, because of his real experiences during the war. Whale is also attributing much of his own personal horrors that he paints on his canvas (both films and portrait artwork that he makes) to these artefacts of battle. There is a lot of depth to Gods and Monsters and plenty of emotion to boot. It spans across nearly every era between the early 1900s and the 1940s. Much of it is told in flashbacks especially the making of Whale's horror films.The plot is basically about Whale and his gardener (Fraser) and their relationship. It is a bit like asking questions and getting answers and showing a bit of skin in-between. Not only do both these actors stand out but Lynn Redgrave plays Whale's housekeeper in her best role to date too! She is an absolute side-splitting hoot and her cynicism is second to none.It would be hard to tell you much more about the plot without giving lots of it away but let's just say that you will learn a lot about everyone in this delightful film and it does come with a shock attached towards the end as the characters move a little closer to one another. The ending is moving and filled with sadness and loss with the passing of time. You can bring a lot to this movie and take a lot of it away with you too.This is an inspiring movie about talent, friendship and filmmaking.

It has everything. Elegance, tragedy and comedy, all tied closely together to form an admirable tapestry of a man's story at the end of his career and life.Brendan Fraser delivers a low-key performance, worth watching, especially when compared to his work in the Mummy series.Lynn Redgrave, is as always, mistress of her skills and gives a superb performance with an appropriate Danish accent, as the Governess of this odd household.Even the theme regarding Whale's latent/rampant homosexuality is kept at a discreet and elegant distance. Never too blatant, nor vulgar, but rather stylishly knit into a very coherent story.It's a kind of a Mephisto's waltz performed by an aging Faustus-like figure, in search for a self-redeeming auto-destruction, which eventually will see itself fulfilled, but not the way the hero of our story expects.In the key words to this movie there are definitions to gay DVD, gay movie or gay romance. It is far from that.This movie has absolutely nothing of a gay movie, nor has it anything to do with being directed at gay people.This work has far more style than this alone. It deals with an old man's conflict, who may be a bit of a dandy, when it comes to ""boys"", but who also genuinely expresses feelings of true tenderness and love, sentiments that today may be unknown to some, even in the so-called heterosexual community, but who are very real and alive in every true human being, be he a woman, a man, or as in this case, a homosexual.What is explored in this picture, is far more the ""soul"" of the matter, and not just the plain physical aspects of it, although elements of this also briefly appear, but always with a sense of style and never just to shock the audience.It is a movie for mature, and thinking audiences, not for those seeking a self-gratifying moment or a sexually oriented one.The DVD has a very good film transfer, sharp and clean, as well as a very well balanced sound included.It is well worth the money, if one is interested in good actor's performances and in a well told story.I can only recommend it.

I had the opportunity to view it again just recently and I am happy to say that this film remains as rich and full as I had recalled it being.  The performance by Sir Ian McKellan reminds us just how masterful he is as an actor, and Brendan Frasier gives a nuanced performance that is subtle and reflective and reminds one that much of the art of acting is listening and reacting.  Lynne Redgrave spectacularly burst back onto the scene, giving a performance as Whale's maid/friend/caretaker that is richly complex: She is a friend and employee, both loving and judgmental of Whale for his homosexual ""lifestyle.""The story is a simple one of friendship and understanding.  It is about the ghosts which haunt us all.  The Gods that have created us and the Monsters which have torn us down, and how sometimes the Monsters are what we need the most.  Director Condon expertly intersperses clips from Whale's The Bride of Frankenstein with flashbacks to WWI, Whale's bygone days of fame, and young Jimmy Whale's childhood in order to give us an overview of the remarkable life this man has led.  The result is that while Whale may seem like a broken down old man at the point the movie takes place, these flash backs  paint a full picture of the man.  Likewise, this lets us understand how Whale feels that all that he was is slipping away, just like his art is falling by the wayside.  In the end, we see an immensely dignified, human being, who did wonderful things.  He loved. He lost. He fought in the war. He was a hedonist. He was a pacifist. And he was loved.With Clayton Boone, the director and Brendan Frasier, give us a modern day physicality of the Frankenstein monster which first draws Whale to the young man.  In the beginning, we're not quite sure what Whale wants from the lad -- does he desire a true friendship or is he just a lecherous old man-but as things progress we realize that while the friendship is important, his desire for the young Boone are a bit darker that even we could have thought.  Likewise we're not sure what Clayton wants from Whale.  But as we watch them become friends, we see a unique bond form...gay man to straight man...and each has found in the other someone to listen to them and understand.Perhaps unsung in this movie is the brilliant performance by Redgrave.  Her housekeeper Hanna is not only an homage to Una O'Conner's ""Minnie"" in The Bride of Frankenstein, but an expert characterization that is humorous and judgmental and, ultimately, loving.  The characterization is as broad as Whale might have directed O'Conner, but the humanity underneath it all is very, very real.Gods and Monsters is clearly fiction.  No one really knows about the last days of Whale.  But in that speculation, the film manages to paint a portrait of a man who was ahead of his time and who lived a life worth living.  In the end, Director Condon and novelist Christopher Bram -- whose book The Father of Frankenstein serves as the underlying source of the movie -- gave Whale a friend in his last days, a young man named Clayton who was as different from Whale as he could be.  They gave him a friendship, and as a result they have created a sad, touching, joyful movie about living and dying with dignity.As the Monster himself would say: Alone, bad...Friend, good.Originally reviewed for Uniquely Pleasurable.",5,"Artful, Entertaining and Moving",1236470400,"03 8, 2009",2009,3408,"['hardly', '11', 'years', 'Gods', 'Monsters', 'was', 'released', 'had', 'opportunity', 'view', 'again', 'just', 'recently', 'am', 'happy', 'say', 'film', 'rich', 'full', 'had', 'recalled', 'being', 'performance', 'Sir', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'just', 'how', 'masterful', 'actor', 'Brendan', 'Frasier', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'subtle', 'reflective', 'one', 'much', 'art', 'acting', 'listening', 'reacting', 'Lynne', 'Redgrave', 'spectacularly', 'burst', 'back', 'scene', 'giving', 'performance', 'Whale', 'maid/friend/caretaker', 'richly', 'complex', 'friend', 'employee', 'loving', 'judgmental', 'Whale', 'homosexual', 'lifestyle', 'story', 'simple', 'one', 'friendship', 'understanding', 'ghosts', 'haunt', 'Gods', 'have', 'created', 'Monsters', 'have', 'torn', 'down', 'how', 'sometimes', 'Monsters', 'are', 'what', 'need', 'most', 'Director', 'Condon', 'expertly', 'clips', 'Whale', 'Bride', 'Frankenstein', 'flashbacks', 'WWI', 'Whale', 'bygone', 'days', 'fame', 'young', 'Jimmy', 'Whale', 'childhood', 'order', 'give', 'overview', 'remarkable', 'life', 'man', 'led', 'result', 'Whale', 'may', 'seem', 'broken', 'down', 'old', 'man', 'point', 'movie', 'place', 'flash', 'backs', 'paint', 'full', 'picture', 'man', 'Likewise', 'understand', 'how', 'Whale', 'feels', 'was', 'slipping', 'away', 'just', 'art', 'falling', 'wayside', 'end', 'see', 'immensely', 'dignified', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'did', 'wonderful', 'things', 'loved', 'lost', 'fought', 'war', 'was', 'hedonist', 'was', 'pacifist', 'was', 'loved.With', 'Clayton', 'Boone', 'director', 'Brendan', 'Frasier', 'give', 'modern', 'day', 'physicality', 'Frankenstein', 'monster', 'first', 'Whale', 'young', 'man', 'beginning', ""'re"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'Whale', 'lad', 'desire', 'true', 'friendship', 'just', 'lecherous', 'old', 'man-but', 'things', 'realize', 'friendship', 'important', 'desire', 'young', 'Boone', 'are', 'bit', 'darker', 'even', 'could', 'have', 'thought', 'Likewise', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'Clayton', 'Whale', 'watch', 'become', 'friends', 'see', 'unique', 'bond', 'form', 'gay', 'man', 'straight', 'man', 'found', 'other', 'someone', 'listen', 'understand.Perhaps', 'unsung', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Redgrave', 'housekeeper', 'Hanna', 'not', 'only', 'homage', 'Una', ""O'Conner"", 'Minnie', 'Bride', 'Frankenstein', 'expert', 'characterization', 'humorous', 'judgmental', 'ultimately', 'loving', 'characterization', 'as', 'broad', 'Whale', 'might', 'have', 'directed', ""O'Conner"", 'humanity', 'very', 'very', 'real.Gods', 'Monsters', 'clearly', 'fiction', 'one', 'really', 'last', 'days', 'Whale', 'speculation', 'film', 'paint', 'portrait', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'who', 'lived', 'life', 'living', 'end', 'Director', 'Condon', 'novelist', 'Christopher', 'Bram', 'book', 'Father', 'Frankenstein', 'underlying', 'source', 'movie', 'gave', 'Whale', 'friend', 'last', 'days', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Clayton', 'who', 'was', 'different', 'Whale', 'could', 'be', 'gave', 'friendship', 'result', 'have', 'created', 'sad', 'touching', 'joyful', 'movie', 'living', 'dying', 'dignity.As', 'Monster', 'would', 'say', 'Alone', 'bad', 'Friend', 'good.Originally', 'reviewed', 'Uniquely', 'Pleasurable']",N/A

504843,A1ABDWJU9RTUWU,B00000IQVD,Rockinghorse Winner,"[6, 35]","OK, there's a lot I didn't like about this movie.  Number 1, the subject, James Whale of Frankenstein fame, is not portrayed very sympathetically.  In fact, I found the character (played by McKlellan) quite displeasing, with his raunchy and egotistical appetites.  There is a term, ""growing old gracefully.""  Mr. Whale in this portrayal does not seem to have become wiser with age and experience, but to have become a sad, pathetic old coot.Secondly, the film goes nowhere in the first 45 minutes.  The narrative merely circles around the central facts of Whale's celebrity, his main films, a possible scandal, all of which are planted in the dialog just so the audience can be informed, for instance, that James Whale made Frankenstein, that he helped create the horror genre, that he is gay, etc.  It just seemed jarring to hear these facts trotted out for narrative purposes, when they could have been revealed in a more timely and less obvious manner in the course of the film.  But as the director wanted to set up the drama early, we are given a crash course on James Whale via the conversations of bar patrons, the gardener and the maid. Puleeeze!Thirdly, I thought the screenplay forced it's points too much.  To take one instance, Fraser's gardener character is first shown coming out of a broken down trailer and stepping into a broken down pickup truck.  OK, he's white trash; got it.  In another scene, following one in which he is offended by James Whales' fliratious manner, he has sex with a girl he picks up in a bar.  Okayyy...feeling a bit unmasculine, are we?  I mean, almost every point of the movie is telegraphed, so the audience is smashed over the head with each point the director wishes to bring home.I guess, I just wish the movie's producers had been more subtle and cunning in how they portrayed people and their emotions.  I wish they had taken the audience's intelligence for granted.  Who did they think would go see Gods and Monsters anyway? Joe Sixpack?  If you're going to make a small independent film, one thing you can take for granted is that those going to see it are going because they have an interest in the film and in the subject matter of the film.

James Whale was a director known best for his horror pictures such as Frankenstein and  Bride of Frankenstein.  We look at a fictional gardener and how he interacts with Whale and how Clay (played by Brendan Fraser) deals with his own inner demons.The film plays best when it deals with Whale's World War I experiences and a few scenes where he is creating Bride of Frankenstein.  Especially touching is the party he goes to and drags his gardener along.  The actors who portray Boris Karloff and Elsa Lanchester were nearly the spitting image (though I imagined Karloff as taller than that).The film is really about Whale's homosexuality and in the Fifties America this is a taboo subject.  The naked young guys and the nude Fraser may be hard for some to bear (and easier for others I assume).I was hoping for more of a docu-drama and less of a concentration on Whale's sexual orientation (of which 75% of the film seems to be) and wanting more horror movie-making.McKellen plays the role straight and Fraser's emotional range as an actor are pushed to the limit.

Performances by Sir Ian McKellan, Lynne  Redgrave and Brenden Fraser keep the action moving along at a fast but  believable pace.  When the film is done, the viewer feels quite rightly  worn out from having run an emotional gamut.  Sir Ian makes a splendid  James Whale--a man of dignity, talent and superb artistry in the process of  losing his mental capabilities, and all too aware of the gradual  deterioration of his mind.  Does Whale or does he not have the right to  direct his final grand exit?  That's a question society still struggles  with.  I especially liked the way Fraser portrayed a &quot;straight&quot;,  very virile male unabashedly publicly befriending a gay man--something that  gives plenty of &quot;straight&quot; males pause today.  Vanessa Redgrave  truly should have gotten the Best Supporting Actress Oscar, for which she  was nominated for her work in this film.  Her portrayal of the loyal but  often disapproving housekeeper was flawless, superb and consistent. There  is real power in McKellan's portrayal of a man very at peace with himself  as a successful person in an environment that was for the most part hostile  to homosexuals--claiming what was rightfully his against any existing odds.  But you will take issue with the character's assessment about where his  personal rights begin and end, as he manipulates Clayton in a drama that  the trusting gardener has no idea is being played out. At the end of the  film you are at odds with yourself about Whale's brillance and aplomb and  good humor, which co-exists with his often callous and inconsiderate  treatment of those closest to him.  McKellan shines as a &quot;god&quot;  and a &quot;monster&quot; rolled into one.  Also, this movie is a terrific  slice of life in Hollywood at its peak in the 1930's and 40's.

504856,A2D63RN5LF14R2,B00000IQVD,"THE BLUEMAHLER ""THE BLUEMAHLER""","[0, 0]","Bill Condon's Gods and Monsters is one of the most beautiful, elegiac films of the last fifteen years. It is a fictionalized, speculative film about the last days of the great golden-age Hollywood director, James Whale, who is best remembered for directing several Universal horror classics, such as The Old Dark House (1932), The Invisible Man (1933), and The Bride of Frankenstein (1935).  When Gods and Monsters was released it received very good reviews, but several critics, obviously uncomfortable with the film's depiction of Whale's open homosexuality, managed to slip in comments regarding the director's ""hedonism.""  One wonders  whether, if the film's subject had been the hetero charm of a Gary Cooper or Errol Flynn, would those same critics have written a praising pat on the back for the celluloid studs?  Regardless, Gods and Monsters, while simplistic, is brave in its depiction of Whale's sexual preference; yet the film also strangely holds back from damning Hollywood's blatant hypocrisy regarding Whale's fall from grace.Ian McKellen, Brendan Fraser, and especially Lynn Redgrave give superlative performances.  Fraser's Clay Boone is Whale's Frankenstein/Adonis of a gardener.  Boone is slow on the uptake when it comes to realizing that his retired celebrity employer (McKellen) is more than just an odd artist.  When Hannah, Whale's maid (Redgrave), lets the cat out of the bag, Boone's initial reaction is one of subdued violence.  However, Boone soon finds himself missing Whale's anecdotes and returns to his employer's studio, securing a promise from Whale to ""go easy on the fag stuff.""Whale gives a ""scout's honor"" but, of course, slips when reminiscing about a male lover in the great war.  Boone utters the lines that every gay man or woman has heard from a homophobe, ""You must think the whole world is gay.  I've got news for you, it's not.""  Boone is a failed Marine, and directionless in life.  Whale's career accomplishments, along with his service as an officer in the war, attract the young man.  The Whale that Boone now sees is aged, gay, and suffering the effects of a stroke, true, but he is still the type of figure Boone was hoping to meet in HollywoodLand.Due to the stroke, Whale frequently lapses into the not-so nostalgic past, which he has spent his life covering up.  He poignantly describes his family to the transfixed gardener, ""I had imagination, creativity and wit.  Where did I get that?  Certainly not from them.  It was like a family of farmers had been given a giraffe and did not know what to do with the creature, except harness it.""Yet, it was hardly the pedestrian mindsets of poor, family Brits that ruined Whale.  Whale was harnessed and then undone by the equally pedestrian corporate mindsets of the Hollywood studio system.  Flinching from fully portraying Hollywood's betrayal of Whale's talent is where the film fails.  The Road Back (1937) was a film that had been on Whale's mind and heart for some time.  It was to be his personal statement against the war.  Gods and Monsters tells us that much, but then short shifts the emotional, more complex truth.  According to Condon's script the studio simply didn't like the film, added some slapstick, and the result was a bomb for which Whale was blamed, thus destroying his career.Actually, the truth is political.  The Jewish heads of Universal studios were, in fact, threatened with a ban from the Nazis, due to The Road Back`s unflattering portrayal of Germany.  The studio heads backed down and Whale was ruined.  Hollywood has never been known for its moral courage.  Charles Chaplin faced the same backlash with The Great Dictator (1940).  Carl Foreman (High Noon, 1952) was among those blacklisted with the aid of Hollywood rethuglicans John Wayne and Howard Hawks.  When Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ (2004) was released churches were taking kids by the busload to see this ""Lethal Jesus"" porn and Wal-Mart stocked its shelves when the DVD was released. The trillion or so dollars it racked in effectively silenced criticisms of its blatant anti-Semitism, and only now after Mel's repeated foot-in-mouth incidents can anyone point out the ""I told you so.""Up against institutional politics, Whale was deemed the idiosyncratic freak.  It was not Whale's sexual orientation, but his refusal to back down to the Nazis that sealed his fate.  The atheistic director was put out to pasture by Executives, who just happened to be Jewish, who were fearful of offending Adolf Hitler.  Ironically, by doing so, those same execs helped put their horror franchise permanently out of business.  The post-Whale Frankenstein films were, in Whale's words, directed by second-rate hacks.  The franchise's later films were copies of Whale's visionary originals, and it did not take audiences long to tire of the unimaginative repetition.This is a vital element in Whale's story and, alas, it is an often told story, especially in Hollywood.  When executives interfere with the artistic vision, in a dollars and sense mindset, they wind up sabotaging their golden-egged goose.  Whale, Orson Welles, Tim Burton (with the Batman franchise) and most recently Sam Raimi (with the Spider-Man franchise) are prominent examples.  By toning down that elemental part of the story, Condon emotionally diminishes Whale's renegade spirit.  Whale's sexuality was a vital part of him and Condon is to be applauded for depicting that, but homosexuality was only a fragment of that spirit.  His stubborn artistry was what drove him and, eventually, got him banished.That (big point) aside, the rest of the film holds true.  Whale's eventual decision is a noble one.  By placing quality of life over quantity, Whale displays a brave, true morality.  He wrong-headedly attempts to solicit Boone's assistance in helping carry out his plan.  However, he sees Boone for what he is; a big pussycat.  Whale repents for misjudging his gardener.  Whale too could stereotype, and he realizes this most poignantly.  Frasier excels here and he rounds out his character so well that one laments more roles like this did not follow for him.  As excellent as Frasier is in the role of Boone, Lynn Redgrave is perfect in the role of Hannah.  She is a pre-Vatican II, unattractive middle-aged Catholic widow.  She chastises her employer's ways, but she truly loves him, and in a moment of crisis that she becomes fully Catholic, praying for Jimmy to have a better life ahead, and feeling he deserves it.  We can relate. McKellen as Whale is mesmerizing and we can easily identify with Hannah's devotion to  him.  Redgrave completely disappears in her role, almost to the point of being unrecognizable.  She intentionally bears a similarity to Whale character actress Una O'Connor, but takes that character to a unpredictable level.  She is simply amazing, and when crisis comes her way, she tackles it with guts and empathy.By focusing more prominently on Whale's sexuality, as opposed to his artistry, Gods and Monsters, unlike Redgrave, falls a bit shy of hitting the mark.  Still, it is an exceptionally intimate, sublime film that will make you fall in love with these people and, with that said, criticisms are rendered superfluous.* MY REVIEW ORIGINALLY APPEARED AT 366

504861,ANN4JW1E08AS6,B00000IQVD,tuberacer,"[4, 12]","A promising movie, that never finally delivers.  The acting is very good, most of the time. The use of a few moviestar look-alikes was fun. Brendan Fraser was ok. He could have had more depth and more presence. Ian McKellen was terrific. His devilish, weak-lipped, wry smile carried the film, as it does in his other films. The Frankenstein myth was interpolated into a grander metaphor to some extent, but not to complete satisfaction.  I pretty much ""got it"" by the middle of the movie and was expecting the movie to traverse some higher plateau on the back of the conflict and metaphor, but it never really got there and the second half didn't add a whole lot of sparkle. I was disappointed.  It didn't live up to being what I had been expecting from all the glowing reviews. Like the monster, it had all the parts, but there wasn't any transforming thunderclaps, no touch of the gods. The ending was rather simple, not at all profound, and the last scene was a bit contrived, even silly, in an amateur film-school kind of way. I suspect others are taken with this film more by the nostalgia it conjures than by the dramatic resolution of its storyline.  It's just not the great film of its reputation.  It's worth watching, but there are many films worth watching, and many others I'd much more recommend for your time.  This one, you could easily go without, unless maybe, you're a real Frankenstein or gay buff, but even then, it's not sufficiently strong on either of those themes. It had great potential. It was ""close, but no cigar""--or maybe, that should have been Mr. Whale's line.My review update: Ok, I watched it a second time--this time without the high expectation--and I'll give it more credit after the second viewing. It ranks among the very good films. I'll take back the ""you could easily go without"" part. It is a very tight film and worth your time for the quality of production and it does have a strong message. But still, ""friend?"" is not a huge message, and I still found its ending weak. Basically, it's a small very good film, still not the five star great of its reputation. I suspect some people overreact to this film out of some form of political correctness. I'd kick it up to a four star--good tight script, mostly good acting, good direction--but it doesn't aspire to the high summit of a five star film.",3,"Close, but no cigar...",1127692800,"09 26, 2005",2005,2340,"['promising', 'movie', 'never', 'finally', 'delivers', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'most', 'time', 'use', 'few', 'moviestar', 'look-alikes', 'was', 'fun', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'was', 'ok', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'depth', 'more', 'presence', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'was', 'terrific', 'devilish', 'weak-lipped', 'wry', 'smile', 'carried', 'film', 'other', 'films', 'Frankenstein', 'myth', 'was', 'interpolated', 'grander', 'metaphor', 'extent', 'not', 'complete', 'satisfaction', 'pretty', 'much', 'got', 'middle', 'movie', 'was', 'expecting', 'movie', 'traverse', 'higher', 'plateau', 'back', 'conflict', 'metaphor', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'there', 'second', 'half', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'whole', 'lot', 'sparkle', 'was', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'being', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'expecting', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'monster', 'had', 'parts', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'transforming', 'thunderclaps', 'touch', 'gods', 'ending', 'was', 'rather', 'simple', 'not', 'profound', 'last', 'scene', 'was', 'bit', 'contrived', 'even', 'silly', 'amateur', 'film-school', 'kind', 'way', 'suspect', 'others', 'are', 'taken', 'film', 'more', 'nostalgia', 'dramatic', 'resolution', 'storyline', 'just', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'reputation', 'worth', 'watching', 'are', 'many', 'films', 'worth', 'watching', 'many', 'others', ""'d"", 'much', 'more', 'recommend', 'time', 'one', 'could', 'easily', 'go', 'maybe', ""'re"", 'real', 'Frankenstein', 'gay', 'buff', 'even', 'then', 'not', 'sufficiently', 'strong', 'themes', 'had', 'great', 'potential', 'was', 'close', 'cigar', 'maybe', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Mr.', 'Whale', 'line.My', 'review', 'update', 'Ok', 'watched', 'second', 'time', 'time', 'high', 'expectation', ""'ll"", 'give', 'more', 'credit', 'second', 'viewing', 'very', 'good', 'films', ""'ll"", 'take', 'back', 'could', 'easily', 'go', 'part', 'very', 'tight', 'film', 'worth', 'time', 'quality', 'production', 'have', 'strong', 'message', 'still', 'friend', 'not', 'huge', 'message', 'still', 'found', 'ending', 'weak', 'Basically', 'small', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'still', 'not', 'five', 'star', 'great', 'reputation', 'suspect', 'people', 'overreact', 'film', 'form', 'political', 'correctness', ""'d"", 'kick', 'up', 'four', 'star', 'good', 'tight', 'script', 'mostly', 'good', 'acting', 'good', 'direction', ""n't"", 'aspire', 'high', 'summit', 'five', 'star', 'film']",N/A
