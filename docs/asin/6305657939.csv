472031,A2NGDGCB1EKZ6F,6305657939,"""2r45""","[0, 0]","Really good movie!  Not an action film as advertised but does manage to keep the audience in suspense.  The story is about an extremely wealthy man (Pierce Bronson) who has done it all and is in constant search of something new and exciting to do; which ultimately leads him into becoming an art  thief.  This course of action gets him involved in a game of cat and mouse  with a woman(Rene Russo) who works for the insurance agency that's trying  to find the art culprit.......The highlight of the movie is Dennis Leary.  He plays a cop who is working along with the insurance agency.  SHAME-SHAME  however on Rene Russo, her character is very annoying and seems to be in  the way in certain scenes.  In addition, she has several topless scenes in  the movie and quite frankly the scenes take away from the film because we  as the audience get to see how old and out of shape she really is and are  left wondering why the wealthy Bronson would find her more attractive then  the other women in the film.  Bronson himself, of course, puts in a  wonderful performance.  It's very easy to believe that he's a wealthy man.  So all in all this movie is worth seeing.",4,SHAME-SHAME,948240000,"01 19, 2000",2000,1162,"['Really', 'good', 'movie', 'Not', 'action', 'film', 'advertised', 'manage', 'keep', 'audience', 'suspense', 'story', 'extremely', 'wealthy', 'man', 'Pierce', 'Bronson', 'who', 'done', 'constant', 'search', 'something', 'new', 'exciting', 'do', 'ultimately', 'becoming', 'art', 'thief', 'course', 'action', 'involved', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'woman', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'who', 'insurance', 'agency', 'trying', 'find', 'art', 'culprit', '.The', 'highlight', 'movie', 'Dennis', 'Leary', 'cop', 'who', 'working', 'along', 'insurance', 'agency', 'SHAME-SHAME', 'however', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'character', 'very', 'annoying', 'be', 'way', 'certain', 'scenes', 'addition', 'several', 'topless', 'scenes', 'movie', 'quite', 'frankly', 'scenes', 'take', 'away', 'film', 'audience', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'old', 'shape', 'really', 'are', 'left', 'wondering', 'why', 'wealthy', 'Bronson', 'would', 'find', 'more', 'attractive', 'then', 'other', 'women', 'film', 'Bronson', 'course', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'very', 'easy', 'believe', 'wealthy', 'man', 'So', 'all', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing']",The Thomas Crown Affair VHS

472035,ADLVFFE4VBT8,6305657939,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[21, 25]","I'm not going to do a movie critique. The Affair's remake is more than 10 years old and everything worth saying about contents, cinematography and actors' acting and looks has been said already. Suffices for me to say that this is a flick I enjoy watching whenever I feel like relaxing, probably because I like watching Pierce Brosnan. Also, it turns out, The Thomas Crown Affair was the first DVD I ever bought - selection was scarce back in 1999. Which partially explains why I ordered the Blu-ray. Sadly, what the postman brought was somewhat disappointing.So, here is my objective evaluation of the Blu-ray edition.- It comes in a cheap case. The kind with holes cut into the plastic walls so that maybe a couple of pennies are saved this way.- It includes both the Blu disc and a double-sided DVD with the so-called 'full screen' on one side and the 'wide screen' version on the other.- There are no extras whatsoever on the Blu disc.- The DVD disc, apparently has one 'extra' - audio commentary by director John McTiernan- Sound is 5.1 DTS-HD- Alternative soundtracks are available in Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese as 5.1 DTS and in mono for Russian, Hungarian, Turkish and Thai.The Blu-ray transfer is just okay. The movie looks and sounds good but I imagine there is some industrial process these days where you throw a DVD into the Blu-ray converter machine and the Blu version comes out automatically - better than the DVD and not much human artist or technician intervention is required. There is nothing outstanding or worth writing about when it comes to this Blu-ray upgrade, other that my brand new, first time watched, unscratched copy skips in two places.This is the first Blu-ray disc ever that skipped on my player. After almost 3 years of Blu-ray watching, I didn't know what Blu-ray skipping looks like. Now I know - the picture disappears for a few seconds, then it reappears. I know that it's skipping, not an equipment issue because I replayed the parts that skipped and was able to reproduce it - probably due to some low quality, cheap process used to produce the discs.I really hesitated between a 3-star rating which means ""It's Okay"" and a 2-star which stands for ""I don't like it"". In the end, the ""I don't like it"" won. I can't recommend this Blu-ray as a purchase, especially to those who already have the DVD. I understand that studios need to make money but, my friends, the quality of this release borders 'junk' grade and we should not encourage the proliferation of such releases by buying them. I am sorry I spent money on my copy and, had I known before ordering what I know now, I would not have placed my order.",2,"Welcome to the World of Cheap Blu-rays - zero extras, it skips",1271116800,"04 13, 2010",2010,2667,"[""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'do', 'movie', 'critique', 'Affair', 'remake', 'more', '10', 'years', 'old', 'everything', 'worth', 'saying', 'contents', 'cinematography', 'actors', 'acting', 'been', 'said', 'already', 'Suffices', 'say', 'flick', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'whenever', 'feel', 'relaxing', 'probably', 'like', 'watching', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Also', 'out', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Affair', 'was', 'first', 'DVD', 'ever', 'bought', 'selection', 'was', 'scarce', 'back', '1999', 'Which', 'partially', 'why', 'ordered', 'Blu-ray', 'Sadly', 'what', 'postman', 'brought', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disappointing.So', 'here', 'objective', 'evaluation', 'Blu-ray', 'edition.-', 'cheap', 'case', 'kind', 'holes', 'cut', 'plastic', 'walls', 'couple', 'pennies', 'are', 'saved', 'way.-', 'Blu', 'disc', 'double-sided', 'DVD', 'so-called', ""'full"", 'screen', 'one', 'side', ""'wide"", 'screen', 'version', 'other.-', 'are', 'extras', 'whatsoever', 'Blu', 'disc.-', 'DVD', 'disc', 'apparently', 'one', ""'extra"", 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'John', 'McTiernan-', 'Sound', '5.1', 'DTS-HD-', 'Alternative', 'soundtracks', 'are', 'available', 'Spanish', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Portuguese', '5.1', 'DTS', 'mono', 'Russian', 'Hungarian', 'Turkish', 'Thai.The', 'Blu-ray', 'transfer', 'just', 'okay', 'movie', 'good', 'imagine', 'industrial', 'process', 'days', 'where', 'throw', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'converter', 'machine', 'Blu', 'version', 'out', 'automatically', 'better', 'DVD', 'not', 'much', 'human', 'artist', 'technician', 'intervention', 'required', 'nothing', 'outstanding', 'worth', 'writing', 'when', 'Blu-ray', 'upgrade', 'other', 'brand', 'new', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'unscratched', 'copy', 'skips', 'two', 'places.This', 'first', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'ever', 'skipped', 'player', 'almost', '3', 'years', 'Blu-ray', 'watching', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Blu-ray', 'skipping', 'looks', 'Now', 'know', 'picture', 'few', 'seconds', 'then', 'know', 'skipping', 'not', 'equipment', 'issue', 'replayed', 'parts', 'skipped', 'was', 'able', 'reproduce', 'probably', 'due', 'low', 'quality', 'cheap', 'process', 'used', 'produce', 'discs.I', 'really', 'hesitated', '3-star', 'rating', 'Okay', '2-star', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'won', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'Blu-ray', 'purchase', 'especially', 'who', 'already', 'have', 'DVD', 'understand', 'studios', 'need', 'make', 'money', 'friends', 'quality', 'release', 'grade', 'should', 'not', 'encourage', 'proliferation', 'such', 'releases', 'buying', 'am', 'sorry', 'spent', 'money', 'copy', 'had', 'known', 'ordering', 'what', 'know', 'now', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'placed', 'order']",The Thomas Crown Affair VHS

472041,AGEIT17HENDIS,6305657939,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","Recently in reviewing the original 1968 Steve McQueen/Faye Dunaway version of the film under review, The Thomas Crown Affair, I made the following comment:&#8220;Everybody knows banks, whether in storefronts, in supermarket lobbies, or in marbled edifices, is where the money is. A lot of people also know of the old yegg, Willie Sutton and his famous, or infamous, remark when asked why he robbed banks and noted sardonically that was where the money was. The question posed by the film under review, The Thomas Crown Affair, is why was a guy who has plenty of money (some four million dollars, yes, pocket change today, hardly walking around money, but a substantial amount in 1968) winding up as the prime suspect in a major Boston bank robbery. Strangely enough Thomas Crown&#8217;s answer is very much like Brother Sutton&#8217;s-that is where the dough is.&#8221;And notwithstanding the change from the bank world to the art museum world that same question can be posed again here-that is where the high-end paintings are.Here is the skinny this time. Super-wealthy New York socialite, Thomas Crown (played by the handsome Irish devil Pierce Brosnan) bored/intrigued/into risk-taking on a big scale who plans capers, you know, basically for the sake of doing them. The one that is central to this film is a 100 million dollar Monet theft down at the Met in New York City. On this caper he gets away with it for a while because he hires guys who don&#8217;t know each other or him on a contract basis and so he is somewhat immune to being ratted on by snitches and guys turning over on him when the heat is on. Finding out who and what this non-criminal criminal is doing drives the action in this film both for the public and private investigators.Naturally the New York cops are clueless about how to handle such a case where it appears that the job was done seamlessly, there was no word on the street about the guy behind the heist and they have to go outside the doughnut shop where they usually hang out to work this one out. Enter one drop-dead sexy sultry female private insurance investigator (played by Rene Russo) who has a serious reputation for  getting the hard cases solved for a serious cut of the recovery money. So Renee (like Faye Dunaway, who has a small role here, in the original)goes to work, gets very close, too close in the end, to this wizard socialite Crown who has a serious case of getting his kicks by high risk actions.Oh yeah, but wait a minute we have Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo in this one, two beautiful people from the 1990s so you know that, well, sex has to show up or this might as well have been a film noir, or something. So sure they ruffle up some sheets, make that plenty of sheets, and Renee gets a little religion about Pierce. So things work out in the end with a little plot twist about where the stolen Monet is located and the happy couple head off into the sunset to share their legitimate dough and bed together.The original TCA has a slight edge here in this reviewer&#8217;s eyes because there was about eight million degrees more chemistry between those two-just ask Faye.",3,Where The Dough Is-Redux,1397865600,"04 19, 2014",2014,3136,"['Recently', 'reviewing', 'original', '1968', 'Steve', 'McQueen/Faye', 'Dunaway', 'version', 'film', 'review', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Affair', 'made', 'following', 'comment', '8220', 'Everybody', 'banks', 'storefronts', 'supermarket', 'lobbies', 'marbled', 'edifices', 'where', 'money', 'lot', 'people', 'also', 'know', 'old', 'yegg', 'Willie', 'Sutton', 'famous', 'infamous', 'remark', 'when', 'asked', 'why', 'robbed', 'banks', 'noted', 'sardonically', 'was', 'where', 'money', 'was', 'question', 'posed', 'film', 'review', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Affair', 'why', 'was', 'guy', 'who', 'plenty', 'money', 'four', 'million', 'dollars', 'yes', 'pocket', 'change', 'today', 'hardly', 'walking', 'money', 'substantial', 'amount', '1968', 'winding', 'up', 'prime', 'suspect', 'major', 'Boston', 'bank', 'robbery', 'Strangely', 'enough', 'Thomas', 'Crown', '8217', 'answer', 'very', 'much', 'Brother', 'Sutton', '8217', 's-that', 'where', 'dough', 'is.', '8221', 'notwithstanding', 'change', 'bank', 'world', 'art', 'museum', 'world', 'same', 'question', 'can', 'be', 'posed', 'again', 'here-that', 'where', 'high-end', 'paintings', 'skinny', 'time', 'Super-wealthy', 'New', 'York', 'socialite', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'played', 'handsome', 'Irish', 'devil', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'bored/intrigued/into', 'risk-taking', 'big', 'scale', 'who', 'capers', 'know', 'basically', 'sake', 'doing', 'one', 'central', 'film', '100', 'million', 'dollar', 'Monet', 'theft', 'down', 'Met', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'caper', 'away', 'while', 'guys', 'who', 'don', '8217', 'know', 'other', 'contract', 'basis', 'so', 'somewhat', 'immune', 'being', 'ratted', 'snitches', 'guys', 'turning', 'over', 'when', 'heat', 'Finding', 'out', 'who', 'what', 'non-criminal', 'criminal', 'doing', 'drives', 'action', 'film', 'public', 'private', 'investigators.Naturally', 'New', 'York', 'cops', 'are', 'clueless', 'how', 'handle', 'case', 'where', 'job', 'was', 'done', 'seamlessly', 'was', 'word', 'street', 'guy', 'heist', 'have', 'go', 'doughnut', 'shop', 'where', 'usually', 'hang', 'out', 'work', 'one', 'out', 'Enter', 'one', 'drop-dead', 'sexy', 'sultry', 'female', 'private', 'insurance', 'investigator', 'played', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'who', 'serious', 'reputation', 'getting', 'hard', 'cases', 'solved', 'serious', 'cut', 'recovery', 'money', 'So', 'Renee', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'who', 'small', 'role', 'here', 'original', 'work', 'very', 'close', 'too', 'close', 'end', 'wizard', 'socialite', 'Crown', 'who', 'serious', 'case', 'getting', 'kicks', 'high', 'risk', 'actions.Oh', 'yeah', 'wait', 'minute', 'have', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'one', 'two', 'beautiful', 'people', '1990s', 'so', 'know', 'well', 'sex', 'show', 'up', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'noir', 'something', 'sure', 'ruffle', 'up', 'sheets', 'make', 'plenty', 'sheets', 'Renee', 'little', 'religion', 'Pierce', 'So', 'things', 'work', 'out', 'end', 'little', 'plot', 'twist', 'where', 'stolen', 'Monet', 'located', 'happy', 'couple', 'head', 'sunset', 'share', 'legitimate', 'dough', 'bed', 'together.The', 'original', 'TCA', 'slight', 'edge', 'here', 'reviewer', '8217', 's', 'eyes', 'was', 'eight', 'million', 'degrees', 'more', 'chemistry', 'two-just', 'ask', 'Faye']",The Thomas Crown Affair VHS

472051,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6305657939,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 3]","Pierce Brosnan has this endearing sensuality that draws you to him, no matter what role he's playing.  I'm a man and I can admit that without hesitation.  That factor is really the only thing that saves `The Thomas Crown Affair' from being nothing more than passable entertainment.  In other words, if it weren't for Brosnan I would have turned the film off almost as soon as it began, or at least the moment Russo walked onto the screen (more on her later).  But no, I didn't.  I watched the film in its entirety, and while it is not dreadful it is far less than worthy of your time and attention.Now I have not seen the original, so I cannot compare the two (the reviews say that this one is superior, so I'm not in a rush to check out the original), but this `remake' definitely has the feel of a remake.  You know, the way that remakes always feel (not always but most of the time) like they are missing something.  This feels like it's missing something.The film follows Thomas Crown, a wealthy businessman (millionaire at that) who is growing bored and so he decides to stage a robbery at the local museum.  Catherine Banning is the insurance investigator hired to aid the police investigation.  She immediately suspects Crown despite the department's disbelief, and so she targets him, and attempts to seduce him.  Crown on the flip side is working her, from every angle in fact.  In the end it boils down to a `does he love me, is he using me, should I rat him out, should I follow him' scenario, which quite frankly grows old very soon.The initial robbery scene is expertly staged and choreographed; it's just a shame that it's the only remotely exciting scene in the film.The acting is very hit or miss.  Pierce is great, as usual.  He is seductive and mysterious and enticing.  He makes you want to know everything about him.  Rene Russo is a major miss for me.  From the second the walked onto the screen it was as if she was trying way too hard.  I don't get the admiration for her performance, for it comes off rather cartoonish rather than grounded.  She is very over-the-top and at times unbearable.  Faye Dunaway (who starred in the original I hear) is also very over-the-top.  Her character is a mere cameo performance and so she is forgivably over-the-top, but nonetheless she is far from good.  I am not a fan of Denis Leary, but he works his character well enough and doesn't take away from the film at all.  He doesn't add anything either, but that's a different story.In the end `The Thomas Crown Affair' has its moments, however few they may be, but the overall appeal of the film is lacking for me.  It's predictable and clich&eacute;d and rather dense.  The dialog is choppy and at times you can see the actors choking on their words, and the formulaic plot (right down to the `omg you're cheating on me, wait no you're not') can be irritating.

The remake is cuter and  livelier, but this doesn't make it better.  A certain restrained aura about  the original flick gives it a tenseness that we share; the remake is too  active, jumbled, does too many things at once.  I wish someone would tell  me why Hollywood engages in so many remakes of perfectly fine movies.  If  the answer were: &quot;to take a fine movie and make it better in one  respect,&quot; I'd applaud.  Sometimes a classic movie can be made better.  Suppose the original is in black-and-white; maybe color would make the  remake better (or maybe not).  Maybe the flaw in the original was an ending  imposed by the old Hollywood code; a more satisfying and realistic ending  in the remake would be a good reason to remake the movie.  My fear,  however, is that the producers these days who want to remake an old movie  have no idea what it is about the old movie that they can improve.  In  short, they have no imagination, no artistic vision, just a desire to  remake a movie.  Maybe they hope that some people will see the title 'THE  THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR' and say, &quot;Hey, I've heard of that, it's supposed  to be pretty good,&quot; and buy the DVD and, to their surprise, it's not  the movie they heard of but just the remake.  I bet BEDAZZLED is another of  these disappointments, though I haven't seen it; but I can hardly imagine  improving on the great original BEDAZZLED.  I'm a sucker for these remakes,  because I keep wondering how they could have improved on the original, and  49 times out of 50 I'm disappointed.

I'm one of those true fanatics of films who'll watch films and come away thinking WHAT were the people thinking who gave it such a low score (or high one, especially when it's films like ""The Last Emperor"" or ""Ghandi"" or ""Chariots of Fire""... you know, the artsy fartsy films regular people think are boring and horrible!).  If you're looking at the 6.8 and are hesitant to give up 2 hours of your time because you might be headed INTO a Last Emperor or Chariots of Fire, don't sweat it.This is Pierce Brosnan at his best, playing the type of character at which he so excels--the gentleman rich man every guy wishes he could be, and every woman wishes she could get.  I was worried Russo wouldn't be able to pull off the sultry role of the woman who was out to nail the ultra-brilliant billionaire, but her acting chops were on full display, her confidence oozing, and Dennis Leary, as the cop out to get the would-be art thief is at his best.Now, if you're the type of person who doesn't like the psychology of romance, or intellectual dalliances, skip this.  This isn't a Bond film.  There are really only 2 action scenes in the entire movie (they're awesome scenes by the way, and both leave you agog at the end, literally LOL!), so if that's what you're expecting, seriously, skip it.  On the other hand, if you want to see a remake which seriously destroys the original in quality, entertainment factor, escapism, and Cheshire Cat grin enticing back and forth intellectual one-upsmanship, ignore the 6.8 (or whatever ridiculously low number is there now) and just lose yourself in it.Honestly, I really thought I was going to be bored watching this, but so long as you don't know the story, you'll find it surprising you time and time again.  This is one of those movies which I thought would end improperly--you see, I really only enjoy films which give me a satisfying ending. And up until the very end, I was about to call this film an epic fail because they chose the wrong ending.  Luckily for everyone, they don't, at least in my mind. It's the ending (the last 30 minutes or so) which make this a 5 star movie IMO. Of course, it's nearly impossible to make the last 30 minutes matter THAT MUCH unless you're seriously emotionally involved in the first hour or hour and a half, and I'm pretty sure just about every adult would be.As a last note, because I believe it to be absolutely that crucial in whether or not you'll enjoy this film, I wouldn't recommend it to much of anyone under, oh, 25 or so (or would do so guardedly), but if you're over 30, you'll ""get it.""  That's not to say nobody under 25 would like it, or that everyone over 30 will, but rather I can definitely see how I wouldn't have enjoyed this film nearly as much, if at all, before I turned 21 (I like to leave some wiggle room, hence the 25).  The romantic difficulties for both of the main characters (Brosnan, Russo) are ones much more easily understood by both men and women ""of a certain age"" and if you don't get those difficulties, you won't, as I said ""get it"" in the film.",5,"For those who see the IMDB score, and may skip it just because of that",1401667200,"06 2, 2014",2014,3112,"['watch', 'lots', 'movies', 'whole', 'bunches', ""'m"", 'one', 'true', 'fanatics', 'films', 'who', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'films', 'come', 'away', 'thinking', 'WHAT', 'were', 'people', 'thinking', 'who', 'gave', 'low', 'score', 'high', 'one', 'especially', 'when', 'films', 'Last', 'Emperor', 'Ghandi', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'know', 'artsy', 'fartsy', 'films', 'regular', 'people', 'think', 'are', 'boring', 'horrible', ""'re"", 'looking', '6.8', 'are', 'hesitant', 'give', 'up', '2', 'hours', 'time', 'might', 'be', 'headed', 'INTO', 'Last', 'Emperor', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'do', ""n't"", 'sweat', 'it.This', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'best', 'playing', 'type', 'character', 'so', 'excels', 'gentleman', 'rich', 'man', 'guy', 'could', 'be', 'woman', 'could', 'get', 'was', 'worried', 'Russo', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'sultry', 'role', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'out', 'nail', 'ultra-brilliant', 'billionaire', 'acting', 'chops', 'were', 'full', 'display', 'confidence', 'oozing', 'Dennis', 'Leary', 'cop', 'out', 'get', 'would-be', 'art', 'thief', 'best.Now', ""'re"", 'type', 'person', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'psychology', 'romance', 'intellectual', 'dalliances', 'skip', ""n't"", 'Bond', 'film', 'are', 'really', 'only', '2', 'action', 'scenes', 'entire', 'movie', ""'re"", 'awesome', 'scenes', 'way', 'leave', 'agog', 'end', 'literally', 'LOL', 'so', 'what', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'seriously', 'skip', 'other', 'hand', 'want', 'see', 'remake', 'seriously', 'original', 'quality', 'entertainment', 'factor', 'escapism', 'Cheshire', 'Cat', 'grin', 'enticing', 'back', 'forth', 'intellectual', 'one-upsmanship', 'ignore', '6.8', 'ridiculously', 'low', 'number', 'there', 'now', 'just', 'lose', 'it.Honestly', 'really', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'bored', 'watching', 'so', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'story', ""'ll"", 'find', 'surprising', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'one', 'movies', 'thought', 'would', 'end', 'improperly', 'see', 'really', 'only', 'enjoy', 'films', 'give', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'up', 'very', 'end', 'was', 'about', 'call', 'film', 'epic', 'fail', 'chose', 'wrong', 'ending', 'Luckily', 'everyone', 'do', ""n't"", 'least', 'mind', 'ending', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'so', 'make', '5', 'star', 'movie', 'IMO', 'course', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'make', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'matter', 'MUCH', ""'re"", 'seriously', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'first', 'hour', 'hour', 'half', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'just', 'adult', 'would', 'be.As', 'last', 'note', 'believe', 'be', 'absolutely', 'crucial', 'not', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'much', 'anyone', 'oh', '25', 'so', 'would', 'do', 'so', 'guardedly', ""'re"", '30', ""'ll"", 'get', 'not', 'say', 'nobody', '25', 'would', 'like', 'everyone', '30', 'will', 'rather', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'how', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'turned', '21', 'like', 'leave', 'wiggle', 'room', 'hence', '25', 'romantic', 'difficulties', 'main', 'characters', 'Brosnan', 'Russo', 'are', 'ones', 'much', 'more', 'easily', 'understood', 'men', 'women', 'certain', 'age', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'difficulties', 'wo', ""n't"", 'said', 'get', 'film']",The Thomas Crown Affair VHS
472058,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,6305657939,"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[5, 6]","In 1968 there was a little caper film titled The THomas Crown Affair starring the ever-cool Steve McQueen and a radiant Faye Dunaway. The film was considered hip, cool and sexy in its way during the late 60's. It took 31 years, but a remake was finally made of this film but this time around starring Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo in the roles originally played by McQueen and Dunaway. With some great direction from thriller and action filmmmaker John McTiernan, 1999's The Thomas Crown Affair ends up being the exception to the rule of remakes of older films turning out lesser than the original. This modern and updated version of The Thomas Crown Affair actually surpasses the original McQueen production. McTiernan's film ably combines humor, thrilling action set pieces, sexy chemistry between the leads and just a beautifully shot film.Set in New York that never looked as good as shot by McTiernan and his crew, Pierce Brosnan stars and shines as the title character Thomas Crown. Thomas Crown is a suave, roguish and successful businessman who has everything a man could ask for: money, power and any woman he desires. What does a man like Crown would ever want in life? The film looks at this and shows that no amount of money in the world could replace the adrenaline rush and thrill of getting acquiring it. Crown does this by staging a complex and elaborate plan to steal a Monet from the NY Metropolitan Arts Museum and do so in the middle of the day. His plan goes off without a hitch and with none the wiser.With the heist completed, the film soon introduces Crown's foil in the form of Rene Russo as insurance investigator Catherine Banning. Ms. Russo never looked more beautiful, sensual and sexy as she did in this film. Her performance as the determined and crafty Banning more than holds up to Brosnan's roguish and playful performance as Thomas Crown. From the moment she appears on-screen as the camera slowly pans up her silky-stocking leg and garters, Russo dominated the scene and pretty much commanded attention from everyone. This was especially true whenever she shared the screen with Denis Leary as police detective in charge of investigating the Monet heist. Leary's always a strong performer in any film he's in but was pretty much lost in the wake of Russo's performance when both were on the screen.The rest of the film was pretty much Crown and Banning trying to get into each others' heads to find the one advantage that would give them an upper-hand in the ""game"" they've both decided to play. It's hard to see who is chasing who in the film. Is Banning chasing Crown as her one and only suspect for the theft or is Crown playing her as part of a much more complicated scheme to spice his life. These questions swirl within the frame of the heist investigation and the growing relationship between the two strong-willed characters.To say that Brosnan and Russo's on-screen chemistry was strong would be a big understatement. The two pretty much sizzle when together. Whether it's a playful, flirtation during a nice dinner out on the town to the two steamy dance numbers in the middle of the film. When Crown asks Banning if she wanted to dance or does she want to dance the temperature just went up by degrees. Their love scenes together shows that it could still be done with class and also have a sense of playfulness and fun.There's not much else to say about McTiernan's remake of the Thomas Crown Affair than to say that he took a good film, that showcased Steve McQueen's coolness for everyone to see, and made a much more superior production in every sense. The direction was excellent and the cinematography was beautiful in every second shot.

Unfortunately I don't find it believable that the type of  character Thomas Crowne appears to be, would frequent a shrink. I found a  number of flaws with this movie.  You can see the character Thomas Crowne  is &quot;bored&quot; and takes risks with his life and obviously his  freedom.  However, you don't get a real insight into the why he does this.  As for Rene Russo's role, it is equally as shallow.  They have some hints  at many former partners, but the why the dissatisfaction and why she is in  the business of investigating insurance fraud is only broadly spoken to.  She too quickly bonds to Pierce Brosnan's character while turning him in  simultaneously.  This is where reading the book can add so much more  insight.

One gets the idea that all those involved really enjoyed making this film.This is a rarity - an almost perfect film, especially with the sexy Rene Russo acting her heart out.  She is alternatively sexy, tempting, catty, sultry and tender - the dance scenes were some of the greatest (and hottest) ever shot.  Brosnan is the perfect rich playboy, a Bruce Wayne with a wry sense of humor and a touch of whimsy who can bare his soul only to his therapist (great cameo by Faye Dunaway).  Ironically the one woman to whom he is attracted is the one dedicated to his downfall.Denis Leary's gritty everyman cop persona is the perfect foil to Brosnan's urbane sophistication.

Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo star in the remake of the 1968 Steve McQueen&amp; Faye Dunaway movie The Thomas Crown Affair. Which personally i think the remake is so much better. This version is helmed by action ature John McTiernan who is best  known for Die Hard. Shows that he isn't just an action director he can  direct a romance. But what makes this movie work is the chemistry between  Brosnan and Russo who sizzle and light up the screen. Pierce Brosnan who is  very handsome and Rene Russo is gorgeous they are both awsome.The  script by By Kurt Wimmer and Leslie Dixon is very good and there is really  never a boring part in it. The script develops the characters well and the  heist scene in the art museum was really well done. The photography is  great so is the jazzy music from Composer Bill Conti. Oh you can't forget  the small but funny role by Faye Dunaway who was in the original. Rent this  or do what ever to see it. becuase it has great chemistry between Brosnan  and Russo and what is really great is that they are about the same age. But  what is the stand out i think is John McTiernan who shows that he can  direct other films than just action. This was maybe one of the best summer  films that i saw. And it proves that Brosnan can do other projects than  just 007 films.

472079,AE23DYT0RDFUV,6305657939,Brian Ridgway,"[9, 21]","Essentially a remake of the 1969 Steve McQueen thriller, thisfilm was supposedly closer to the content of the original novel. Italso showed some promise because of its director, John McTiernan, who is known for his share of effective thrillers (Die Hard, Predator, Hunt for Red October.)The story here is a simple one; Brosnan is a rich executive who grows bored with his excessive wealth, so much so that he ... Rene Russo is a mid-western insurance investigator sent to unravel the mystery of the missing painting. It doesn't take long before she figures out that... By the film's mid-point, the pair are already involved romantically (who is using who?), and as she grows closer to cracking the case, he finds himself offering her several substantial bribes to ... and run away with him. The offer is tempting, only because she suspects he's really a lonely man and is sincere with his romantic overtures.Sounds more interesting than it really is. Very little happens in this movie that we haven't seen already in much better films. Russo's character works with the New York Police on this case, but they seem to offer little to her investigation beyond stereotypical movie badgering.  Brosnan offers even less to this part beyond staring off into the distance and squinting a lot. So far, the range I've seen him exhibit in his big screen offerings have been two: passive disinterest and aggressive disinterest. Maybe women find him charming, but I have yet to what would qualify him for a more masculine, tough role such as James Bond.And Rene Russo? She looks great here, but it isn't long before the story requires her to begin inserting gratuitous topless scenes. So we get Rene topless on a marble stairway...Rene topless in a beach-front house ...Rene topless on a cold beach where the temperature seems to be hovering near a chilly 50 degrees. It's too bad that a script that should've called for a sophisticated, elegant woman was reduced to a 1970's soft-core drive-in role. For that, McTiernan should be sucker-punched.And corporate sponsorships aplenty--this movie is full of them! One scene has everyone stopping dead in their tracks while Rene empties a can of PEPSI-ONE in one guzzle! (Man, look at that babe drink!) There's even a nifty boat race that seems to be sponsored by Lucent Technology (as apparent by the huge, painted banner.) It's not bad enough these corporate tools cause aggravation in my daily life -- now I get to go cheer them on in their latest big-screen adventure!All in all, a lackluster film, filled with performances by people who truly didn't seem particularly attracted to each other, as they skirt around exotic locations and eat better foods and wear finer clothes than I'll probably experience in my lifetime. Watching this movie didn't make me feel anything except maybe a little contempt for being an American. That's something I never want to feel, and certainly don't want to pay good money to experience.

I also thought the story was improved upon in the new version and I was more satisfied by the challenge Bronsnan's character found in Russo's bluntness. On the other hand, the sumptuous music score by Michel LeGrand in the early film was superior to the weak, lackluster and frangmented score that Bill Conti created for the new one.

Despite it's being one of my favorite films, I admit that I enjoy it more for the beautiful costumes, sets, scenery and the idea the film presents rather than the film itself.I love *The Thomas Crown Affair* because of the witty banter between Rene Russo and Pierce Brosnan. I love it because of the idea of an insanely wealthy man who nevertheless decides to steal art on the side, as an entertainment (I'm a sucker for films about thieves). I love it  because of the great music that's in it. I love it because of the wealthy lifestyle it represents. And I love it because it's just simply lovely to look at. (There are some breathtaking scenes at the black and white ball, various restaurants, and at Crown's remote island hideaway.)There are, however, NUMEROUS plot flaws, which I preseme are a result of trying to make the plot sufficiently complex as to seem to originate from a genius like Crown. The first couple of times I saw it, I didn't really notice them. Now, however, I identify a new problem with it  practically every time I sit down to watch it.There are several circumstances surrounding the theft of the Monet that just don't really make sense. Why, for example, DOES the heat go up more around the Monet than in the other parts of the museum--that's never really explained. Why do the police assume that the theives lower the security doors to the impressionist wing, when in fact it's the museum staff who lower them AFTER the attempted theft is discovered--that's clearly shown in the film. Also, I don't know much about paintings, but wouldn't folding a canvas in half damage the paint on this amazingly expensive piece that Crown has gone to so much trouble to steal?There are other problems with the movie, as well. The secretary in one of the office scenes announces the same upcoming conference call in ""fifteen minutes"" in two different scenes, when more than that amount of time has obvously passed. The Romanians involved with the attempted theft of the Monet are really almost just too thug-ish to be believable. The fact that ""Yanni doesn't speak English"" is made far too obvious as they initially enter the museum and ends up seeming like a silly and unnecessary plot device later in the film.Nevertheless--even with all this said--I still love the movie. If you don't look too closely at the dizzying plot, it really isn't bad at all. You should watch it for the reasons I outlined earlier. Watch it because it's beatiful.

When Rene Russo's character is analyzing the theft and  determing the method, she is impressed by the style, the cleverness of the  crime and becomes attracted to the criminal because of his cleverness.  She  never is outraged by the crime, but instead is turned on by it -- here, at  last, is a worthy adversary, someone she can have fun chasing.John  McTiernan's directing is very stylish, as usual,  and suits the material  very well, forming a symbiotic relationship with Pierce Brosnan's and Rene  Russo's performances.

On top of that, why did they decide to turn an intelligent ""cat and mouse"" movie into a mind-numbing action film?  While I was amply entertained, I had to completely detach myself from the original in order to enjoy it.  One scene of note, however, is the final heist scene-spectacular action and extremely entertaining.They have weakened the incredibly strong character that Steve McQueen created.  In this remake, Thomas Crowne solicits the help of a psychiatrist (really just a ploy to pull Faye Dunaway into a cameo role) in order to help him sort out the troubles he has with Rene Russo.  Steve McQueen needs no such crutch to get him through.  In a similar manner, Russo is not nearly as compelling as Dunaway-her character is much more fragile and less complex than the original.  I was very disappointed to see the wonderful characters from the original collapse at their knees and fall in the dust.  As interesting as the action is, the lack of character interest is a definite turn-off.Do yourself a favor: see the original.

Allen,"[0, 1]","""The Thomas Crown Affair"" (1999) is an excellent, but different in important ways, re-make of the Steve McQueen 1968 movie.The 1999 ""Thomas Crown"" movie shows The Elegant World Of 1999 Rich People In NYC.It's a re-make in some ways of the  1968 movie of the same title, which was also wonderful, but very different (and set in Boston).The Thomas Crown Affair (1999) starring Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo is smoother and more elegant than the 1968 movie, the latter shot it proletarian times which valued dirt under the fingernail people (the ""proletarian, war on poverty 60's!"").McQueen wasn't elegant in the 1968 movie, and places visited in that movie weren't either. The starting scene of the 1968 movie set the tone.....a dumb plastic fantastic no-architecture hotel of the times, sanitary with no style...and fat Jack Weston as the ""Everyman"" introducing viewers to the story and it's people.Rich people were doing better in 1999, the Thomas Crown Affair version of that year shows it....Brosnan's version of Crown is smoother, more elegant and polished, almost like a dancer.The museum setting of the two heists in the movie (the NYC public library built by elegant people was used for ""museum"" interiors, the lobby, etc. etc.) makes the movie cultural and celebrates the world of cultured rich people far more than the 1968 movie did.All this is nice....the way ""comedy of manners"" movies (and stage plays) about rich people in the 1930's and before were nice.....a look at ""the good life"" served up in elegant settings, and enjoyed by its participants for good reasons.Brosnan's clothes fit better than McQueen's did. His (Brosnan's) hair cut is better, less deliberate, more understated and elegant than McQueen's.The trip to Martineque in the Caribbean was a good touch (contrast it to the GUYS AND DOLLS [1956] trip to Cuba made by Marlon Brando and Jean Simmons), and the improved glider plane in the 1999 movie was, too (much less clunky plane than McQueen's was in 1968).I could almost taste the smooth, high priced wine served in restaurant scenes Brosnan and Russo shared. Expensive red wine priced at $50/bottle in liquor stores, double that in NYC restaurants.The 1999 version of Thomas Crown is a travelogue showing the good life in NYC enjoyed by people with time, money, good taste, and all the rest of it.Except for the heavy sex scenes (which aren't believable or attractive), the movie is easy to watch, enjoyable, and smooth....just like an expensive bottle of good red wine, served in a nice place by good people doing the serving and nearby as fellow customers.Dinner Rush (1990) is another 90's movie about rich people in NYC, and their night life (about gangsters in part, but gangsters with elegant haircuts!).Sometimes, the best part of movies is the travel experience they provide, and the plot and even the acting isn't as important.""Where were you?"" is sometimes the question to ask.The Thomas Crown Affair (1999) starring Pierce Brosnan does a good job with that.

472114,A3BR4RIE8HDY1W,6305657939,David Rasquinha,"[2, 2]","I normally make it a point to never watch either sequels or re-makes but the Thomas Crown Affair (TCA) with Pierce Brosnan &amp; Rene Russo is the rare case of the re-make being way better than the original (Steve McQueen-Faye Dunaway).  This is a movie that is cerebral and keeps you guessing, while at the same time being great fun.  This is a movie that is elegant and crisp; one is hard pressed to find a wasted moment.  This is a movie to savor again and again. I will not dwell on the story to avoid being a spoiler (In a sentence, a painting is stolen brilliantly by Brosnan and Russo is on his trail) and for that matter, the story line is really besides the point. The key here is the battle of wits between two masters of their respective arenas. Each lives for the thrill of what they do and each respects the other as a worthy adversary - the song Windmills of your Mind is perfectly in place here. Pierce Brosnan is his usual relaxed mix of languid ease and coiled tension spring, sticking his neck out and running with the wind. Hard as it is to compete with Brosnan who gets the best lines in the movie, Rene Russo comes off very well indeed as insurance investigator Catherine Banning. She prowls through the movie like a cat, sensual and predatory in turn. So strong are Brosnan and Russo in fact that the rest of the cast appears lackluster in comparison. TCA is a viewing delight as well with its swift changes of scene from city to country to glorious island. For me the only let down was the stereotyping of Russo as the standard jealous female towards the end, totally at odds with her character till then. Also the ending was a little too cute; but then to be fair, I cannot for the life of me think of a better alternative.

472118,A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0,6305657939,"Deb Nam-Krane ""dnkboston""","[4, 6]","I saw this movie when it first came out in 1999.  Knowing it was a remake, I didn't expect much.  However, the presence of Rene Russo, Pierce Brosnan and Denis Leary were enough to push me past my prejudice, and it was an hour and a half (or so) well spent.Anyone looking for anything remotely deep will be disappointed.  This is a fun, fluffy, ultimately consequenceless plot.  Pierce Brosnan, the man who has everything, amuses himself by robbing the Met in New York of a famous painting and then putting it back almost immediately.  Rene Russo, Brosnan's perfect match, is a high class bounty hunter out to catch him.  Naturally, things get complicated when they begin an affair- just for fun at first, but then emotional complications set in.  Denis Leary is the world weary NYC cop who raises his eyebrows in Russo's direction and helps her prove the case against Brosnan, but ultimately states at the end of the movie that in the grand scheme of everything he's seen, he doesn't have a problem letting Brosnan go (lucky for them).From the sets at the Met to the high society parties, restaurant and exotic getaways, the movie is visually satisfying from beginning to end.  And speaking of visuals, anyone watching this movie shouldn't be too much of a prude- there is almost a half hour period where Russo (and Brosnan, to a lesser extent) spend much of their screen time naked.  While both look great, after the first fifteen minutes I did start wondering when they were going to put their clothing back on.The movie is also fast-moving in the appropriate places, particularly when Brosnan makes the initial theft and then foils the sting to capture him.  Of course you have to suspend your disbelief that someone (even James Bond) could pull all of this off, but the plotting is so much fun that you find yourself nodding along.While the chemistry between Russo and Brosnan is palpable, I've got to say, I found myself wishing at times that she would choose Leary over Brosnan.  Who knew that Mr. Crass Comedian could do so well as a potential romantic lead?Finally, a word about the original.  I rented the McQueen/Dunaway version shortly after I saw this, thinking it would be even better.  I was bitterly disappointed.

472119,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6305657939,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[3, 5]","I've never watched the original movie from 1968 but after watching the 1999 version of &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot;, I wanted to see more.  I must admit that the main motivator from watching this movie was an  interview in Los Angeles Magazine with Rene Russo.  The article was quite  interesting and shedding more on the life of the beautiful Rene Russo of  Lethal Weapon fame.  In this movie, she was absolutely...delicious.  Brosnan as Thomas Crown does a pretty good job.  The hot love scenes in  this movie is very hot!  Denis Leary's presence in this movie is actually  not that bad in this movie.After reading the special booklet that  accompanied the DVD (Btw, I urge companies that include the books to please  add them to the actual DVD), you do read about the differences between the  two movies.  One marked by betrayal and one marked by romance.  Which do  you prefer depends on the viewer.  The cat and mouse storyline was very  interesting but I felt the cat gave up to easily.  It is a very good movie  nevertheless and the movie is worth purchasing on DVD.  It was nice to see  the two trailers for both movies and although it doesn't carry the many  extras that other DVD's may have these days, the DVD gets a B- in the  extras department..The DVD gives you a choice of widescreen or  standard.  The video is very good with some noticeable artifacts during the  airplane scene during the middle of the film. But that wasn't so  distracting to me at all.  The audio is very well done and I liked the  musical score for the film.This is a more of a dialogue movie but if you  are looking for some deep audio using your equipment capability, you will  find a few moments.  As for the characters, sometimes watching Pierce  Brosnan and Thomas Crown feels like your watching James Bond.  Rene  Russo...definitely sexy and beautiful!  A great actress.I'm not sure  how this movie did in the box office, but if this is one of the movies that  bombed in the box office, as a movie aficionado, this movie is pretty good  (not great) and worth viewing.Anyway, it's a beautiful DVD and I think  fans of the celebrities or the movie will enjoy this movie.  Just bare in  mind that the two movies are different and it was meant to be that way.  Second, don't read the book first, read it after the movie.

472120,A1IO3LVYV5ZMK8,6305657939,Desmond Chan,"[6, 7]","THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR is one movie that boasts just the right mix of effervescent chemistry to save the movie from sinking into a Bond flick. Rene Russo is Catherine Benett, an insurance investigator is sent to  incriminate Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) for his theft of a famous  painting. The movie is done in a seductively opulent manner, where Thomas  Crown engages in hedonism in the lifestyle of the rich and famous - while  viewers are unwittingly engaged in dreamy escapism. There are exciting  moments too - the theft like the re-enactment of Trojan Horse trick is a  parody; the mounting tension between Catherine and Thomas is simply a  pleasure to watch.Rene Russo is delightful and proves herself to be one  sexy momma. She is bold, passionate and her acting is top-notch. She  handles the sexy scene with sass and the emotional scenes with finesse.  Pierce Brosnan tries hard to leave behind the shadows of Bond, and is  successful being the astute businessman. Their chemistry is altogether  smouldering. John McTiernan (Die Hard, The 13th warrior) has altogether  piece up a picture with good pacing and most importantly one fraught with  genuine chemistry. Though the plot may lack substance or sink into a fluffy  dream with a predictable ending, THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR is buoyant and  uplifting.

Knouse,"[1, 2]","After a forgettable debut film also starring Pierce Brosnan, ""Nomads"" 1986, director John McTiernan had an incredibly successful trifecta of blockbuster films:  ""Predator"" 1987, ""Die Hard"" 1988, and ""The Hunt for Red October"" 1990.  The films that followed were duds by comparison: ""Medicine Man"" 1992, ""The Last Action Hero"" 1993, ""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"" 1995, ""The 13th Warrior"" 1999, and a remake of the James Caan film ""Rollerball"" 2002.  In the middle of these films, and released the same year as ""The 13th Warrior"" was a remake of a classic called ""The Thomas Crown Affair.""  Say what you will about the original, there is no denying that it now looks incredibly dated.  This newer version is sleak and sexy.  After so many mediocre films, it seemed that John McTiernan had officially lost his inspiration.  With this version of ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" he found it again, with particularly large amounts of kudos handed out to cinematographer Tom Priestly who keeps the camera moving left and right, back and forth at different speeds and angles mixed in with tracking shots that keep the movie accelerating constantly forward even at the most relaxed moments in the film.  The script is surprisingly intelligent with a refreshing liason between two attractive middle-aged actors who are both believable in their characters, sharing some phenomenal chemistry besides as actors.  There was a time when I thought John McTiernan was the most under-appreciated director working in Hollywood.  This film reminded me that at one time he had both talent and inspiration.

Mok,"[1, 4]","Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo certainly make for a handsome screen couple, but this movie somehow carries something of a dated feel to it.Director John McTiernan, known as a master of pacing and action, shifts to low gear  on this one, seemingly at a loss with directing such a polite, almost  comedy-of-manners script that's more character-based than set-piece-based.  McTiernan's signatures are big, relentless, kinetic sequences where the  stakes are always life-or-death.  In The Thomas Crown Affair, it's a  classic Hollywood tango between man and woman -- not exactly McTiernan's  fare.  Rene Russo oozes charisma in the lead, but the soapier moments in  the script are ill suited to her.  And Brosnan's role suffers from not  enough screen time in the middle parts, hence not quite enough of an  antagonist for Russo.The first 20 minutes of the film clued me in to its  inherent pacing problem.  Not only do those Romanian/German thieves  disappear from the film entirely with no payoff (a no-no in scripting),  they take up entirely too much narrative time.  And 20 minutes with no  protagonist is too loooong!  Though there's action going on, much of this  section could've been tightened, allowing us to see more of Crown's  scheming, and to allow Russo a much earlier, timelier entrance.This one  will do well enough for a night of mild entertainment, but pales alongside  McTiernan's previous efforts.",3,"Good old-fashioned star vehicle, a little slow.",947462400,"01 10, 2000",2000,1413,"['Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'certainly', 'make', 'handsome', 'screen', 'couple', 'movie', 'somehow', 'something', 'dated', 'feel', 'it.Director', 'John', 'McTiernan', 'known', 'master', 'pacing', 'action', 'shifts', 'low', 'gear', 'one', 'seemingly', 'loss', 'directing', 'polite', 'almost', 'comedy-of-manners', 'script', 'more', 'character-based', 'set-piece-based', 'McTiernan', 'signatures', 'are', 'big', 'relentless', 'kinetic', 'sequences', 'where', 'stakes', 'are', 'always', 'life-or-death', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Affair', 'classic', 'Hollywood', 'tango', 'man', 'woman', 'not', 'exactly', 'McTiernan', 'fare', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'charisma', 'lead', 'soapier', 'moments', 'script', 'are', 'ill', 'suited', 'Brosnan', 'role', 'suffers', 'not', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'middle', 'parts', 'hence', 'not', 'quite', 'enough', 'antagonist', 'Russo.The', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'film', 'clued', 'inherent', 'pacing', 'problem', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'Romanian/German', 'thieves', 'disappear', 'film', 'entirely', 'payoff', 'no-no', 'scripting', 'take', 'up', 'entirely', 'too', 'much', 'narrative', 'time', '20', 'minutes', 'protagonist', 'too', 'loooong', 'action', 'going', 'much', 'section', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'tightened', 'allowing', 'see', 'more', 'Crown', 'scheming', 'allow', 'Russo', 'much', 'earlier', 'timelier', 'entrance.This', 'one', 'will', 'do', 'well', 'enough', 'night', 'mild', 'entertainment', 'pales', 'alongside', 'McTiernan', 'previous', 'efforts']",The Thomas Crown Affair VHS

472135,A1UWGR88UD16Z6,6305657939,"Edward Rasen Jr. ""ExecEditor""","[3, 6]","Slick, stylish remake of 1968 film which had Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway in lead roles. This time we have Irish actor Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo in a formula love story similar in many aspects to James Bond movies from the late 90s, which coincidentally starred Pierce Brosnan.If you want a safe, entertaining movie to watch with a girfriend or wife then this fits the bill. Don't be deceived by the art-heist caper as it is simply a hook to connect billionaire Wall Street crook Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) with insurance investigator Catherine Banning (Rene Russo). Females love Rene because she is not a stunning, hot-body and provides subliminal hope to all average looking girls.In reality this is just an old-fashioned Hollywood love story in which rich playboy falls for poor, working girl. He dazzles her with expensive restaurants, jewelry and trips. She pretends to play hard-to-get but in the end succumbs to his money and lifestyle. Story ends with them embracing and kissing.In spite of slick production and excellent direction by John McTiernan, the script by Leslie Dixon and Kurt Wimmer has glaring problems. Leslie wrote the love scenes and Kurt the action sequences. Approximately 12 minutes into the film and two days after the heist of a $100 million Claude Monet painting from a New York City musuem, insurance investigator Rene Russo while guzzling a can of Pepsi One in a New York Police Department precinct office has a mind-boggling revelation: billionaire Wall Street financier Thomas Crown is the thief. She rushes to a computer terminal and with four keystrokes generates a report about all top bidders at worldwide auctions during the previous five years for Claude Monet paintings. Voila, Thomas Crown is consistently among the top bidders.Then with nothing more than the auction report and her feminine intuition, Rene confronts Pierce. And, so begins the cat-and-mouse romance. Rene has a dossier about Pierce and Pierce a dossier about Rene. She is from a poor family in Lima, Ohio and has clawed her way into the world of high-paid of insurance investigators with a gig for some rich Swiss. Yadda, yadda, yadda.After dancing the tango, he asks if she ""wants to dance or wants to dance?"" They rush to his luxurious Brownstone in the upper 60s (streets) off Park Avenue in Manhattan and fornicate on the stairs leading to his bedroom and then again on a desk in his home office. Rene or her body double shows bare breasts.Shortly thereafter, they fly a glider plane and then fly by private jet to the Caribbean island of Martinique for a romantic tryst.Of course, he has fallen in love with her and to seal the relationship promises to return the stolen painting. But, she cannot forsake her alleged ideals and commitment to her employer, so she tips the New York Police Department about his plan to return the painting to the museum during the day, just before her planned elopement with Pierce.  However, Pierce assumes such and brazenly outwits the NYPD by mysteriously infiltrating dozens of similarly dressed men into the museum. NYPD detectives are reduced to bumbling idiots and Rene is happy. As she sneaks away to rendezvous with Pierce, the chief detective tells her to say hello to Pierce.Rene rushes to meet Pierce at the East River heliport in Manhattan but Pierce is not there as promised. Rene proceeds to JFK airport and boards a United Airlines flight to London. After the plane departs she begins crying. A man in the seat behind her offers a hankerchief. Yes, it is Pierce. Somehow, he either followed her or knew she would flee to London. Somehow he knew she would fly United Airlines rather the more popular British Airways, Virgin Air or American Airlines. Somehow he managed to obtain the seat behind her. And, somehow he managed to board without her noticing.End of story as they embrace and kiss and she promises to break both his arms if he ever pulls another similar stunt. Most females in the audience will have tears in their eyes. All I can think is that I write free reviews and two writers got paid $1 million for writing trite cliches.This film premiered during 1999 with a mild box-office opening of $14.6 million in the USA. Eventually after two years it generated worldwide box-office revenues of $124 million. However, it was far overshadowed by the World Is Not Enough, the James Bond film starring Pierce, which opened in the USA during early November 1999 with an initial weekend gross of $35 million and then went on to become the then biggest-grossing James Bond film with worldwide theatrical revenue of $362 million.Pierce began playing James Bond in Goldeneye which was released during 1995. He was the fifth actor playing Bond and replaced Timothy Dutton. You can see much of the James Bond films in the Thomas Crown Affair, especially since Pierce also produced the Thomas Crown film.However, as with the first Thomas Crown Affair film, it is superficial like a stunning, mindless blonde bimbo or male model. Beneath the surface are the usual cliches giving hope to all poor girls dreaming of escape from poverty by marrying a rich man and living happily after. Such nonsense is being perpetuated by alleged music cable channel VH1 which for the 2009-2010 season is offering psuedo-reality show ""Megan Wants To Marry A Millionaire."" I wonder if Megan is going to fornicate on second dates like Rene and Pierce?Pierce since 1999 has been trying to produce Thomas Crown Affair 2 and during 2009 said that if it did not go into production during 2009 that it would probably never happen. After ten years, I suspect that few people care. And, apparently the Thomas Crown Affair with Pierce and Rene is no longer a hot commodity considering the low price on Amazon for used DVDs in very good condition. That says more than all the glowing reviews by Pierce and Rene fans.By the way, I formerly worked for a very rich man who had a world class art collection and regularly bought at worldwide auctions. He never attended such and never bought in his name which is standard practice for the ultra-rich. First and foremost he did not want rivals to know he was pursuing any artwork and secondly for security and insurance, he did not want public records of his acquisitions.So, Rene's supernatural revelation and miraculous, instantaneous worldwide auction report is nothing but nonsense and Hollywood fantasy which also is this film's foundation. If nonsense and fantasy are your desire then this will fulfill.",3,Fantasy Love Nonsense,1243209600,"05 25, 2009",2009,6490,"['Slick', 'stylish', 'remake', '1968', 'film', 'had', 'Steve', 'McQueen',

Comfortably in character, he plays a bored tycoon whose million dollar business deals no longer give him an adrenaline rush.  He turns to another passion - art collecting, from the Metropolitan Museum  of Art, no less.  The theft scene has a fast-paced, Bond-like theme closing  with Crown's smug satisfaction as he toasts his latest Impressionist  acquisition.  Nevertheless, he gets more than he bargained for in the shape  and form of Rene Russo who plays the equally sharp and cool international  agent hired by the insurance company to retrieve the million dollar  painting.  She zeroes in on Crown immediately and with pure sex appeal and  feminine grace, she &quot;gets her man.&quot;  Both enjoy playing the  delicious cat and mouse games, each only briefly enjoying a moment of power  before it's regained by the other.It's a sheer delight watching the  hot chemistry between Brosnan and Russo.  There's a steamy rhythmic dance  sequence including the famous see-through dress, plenty of sparkling  repartee, and a Caribbean island romp guaranteed to amuse even slightly the  most jaded viewer.  Denis Leary is the tender-hearted detective with the  tough-guy exterior and Faye Dunaway is amusing as Crown's psychiatrist who  is more interested in tormenting her client than in providing any sort of  therapy.

A total fantasy, this movie is escapism at its best, and it's pretty sexy,  too (even though the characters actually look close to their supposed  'movie' age... amazing!).I think that this is the perfect movie for  anyone who wants to watch a fun, interesting film made, definitely, for  adults.  There are no Bond girls here, and Russo is just as gorgeous as she  is smart.  The dialogue reminded me of some of my favorite movies - from  the '30s and '40s - where the exchanges between characters are just as  important as the plot (if they aren't, in fact, the actual plot).

If you are interested in a comparison of the two, read my comment posted at the 1968 version.This was a slick, big  money production that delivered. John McTiernan's direction was excellent,  the photography rich, the locations magnificent and the opulent lifestyle  nicely portrayed.In the story, a rich gazillionaire art collector, bored  with the ease with which he makes his gazillions, decides to steal a Monet  that he easily could have purchased if it were for sale. Hmmmmm. A little  far fetched, but okay. The heist itself was the best part of the plot. The  rest of the story after his nemesis love interest (Rene Russo) is  introduced is pretty predictable stuff. The writers tried to throw in a  couple of curves but I can't imagine anyone was fooled. Still, it was  entertaining and there is a certain feeling of harmony when everything  turns out about the way the viewer hopes and expects.Pierce Brosnan was  the perfect choice for this role. It was a small transition from James Bond  to Double O Seven Figures. He only had to lose the Walther PPK. He was born  to play the oversexed, smarter than everyone else, high society loner. With  him as the anchor, the film could not go too far wrong.I have mixed  feelings about the selection of sex symbol wanna-be Rene Russo, who was  looking a bit weather beaten in this film. Russo's (and McTiernan's)  decision to bare all was a miscalculation. Rene's sexuality benefits when  something is left to the imagination. On the other hand, she handled the  emotional tight rope of the character superbly; cunning, smart, and torn  between her ambition and her passion. If you could combine Russo's acting  ability with Catherine Zeta-Jones' (who played essentially the same  character in &quot;Entrapment&quot;) looks you'd have the perfect actress  for this role.Denis Leary, as the detective, was the biggest  disappointment. Here is a guy who has perfected the art of being the  insensitive tough guy, trying to play the role as Mr. Sensitive. He was  either miscast or misguided in this endeavor. It fell flat as a  canvas.All in all, a commendable film. I gave it an 8, and though it may  not become a classic, you could do a lot worse.",4,Slick remake is a good film in it's own right,956102400,"04 19, 2000",2000,2305,"['When', 'saw', 'film', 'had', ""n't"", 'yet', 'seen', 'original', 'review', 'film', 'own', 'merits', 'are', 'interested', 'comparison', 'two', 'read', 'comment', 'posted', '1968', 'version.This', 'was', 'slick', 'big', 'money', 'production', 'delivered', 'John', 'McTiernan', 'direction', 'was', 'excellent', 'photography', 'rich', 'locations', 'magnificent', 'opulent', 'lifestyle', 'nicely', 'portrayed.In', 'story', 'rich', 'gazillionaire', 'art', 'collector', 'bored', 'ease', 'gazillions', 'decides', 'steal', 'Monet', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'purchased', 'were', 'sale', 'Hmmmmm', 'little', 'far', 'fetched', 'okay', 'heist', 'was', 'best', 'part', 'plot', 'rest', 'story', 'nemesis', 'love', 'interest', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'introduced', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'stuff', 'writers', 'tried', 'throw', 'couple', 'curves', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'was', 'fooled', 'Still', 'was', 'entertaining', 'certain', 'feeling', 'harmony', 'when', 'everything', 'out', 'way', 'viewer', 'hopes', 'expects.Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'role', 'was', 'small', 'transition', 'James', 'Bond', 'Double', 'O', 'Seven', 'Figures', 'only', 'had', 'lose', 'Walther', 'PPK', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'oversexed', 'smarter', 'everyone', 'else', 'high', 'society', 'loner', 'anchor', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'wrong.I', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'selection', 'sex', 'symbol', 'wanna-be', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'who', 'was', 'looking', 'bit', 'weather', 'beaten', 'film', 'Russo', 'McTiernan', 'decision', 'bare', 'was', 'miscalculation', 'Rene', 'sexuality', 'benefits', 'when', 'something', 'left', 'imagination', 'other', 'hand', 'handled', 'emotional', 'tight', 'rope', 'character', 'superbly', 'cunning', 'smart', 'torn', 'ambition', 'passion', 'could', 'combine', 'Russo', 'acting', 'ability', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'who', 'played', 'essentially', 'same', 'character', 'quot', 'Entrapment', 'quot', ""'d"", 'have', 'perfect', 'actress', 'role.Denis', 'Leary', 'detective', 'was', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'Here', 'guy', 'who', 'perfected', 'art', 'being', 'insensitive', 'tough', 'guy', 'trying', 'play', 'role', 'Mr', 'Sensitive', 'was', 'miscast', 'misguided', 'endeavor', 'fell', 'flat', 'canvas.All', 'commendable', 'film', 'gave', '8', 'may', 'not', 'become', 'classic', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'worse']",The Thomas Crown Affair VHS
472144,A2CPM6AEJHVNKL,6305657939,Found Highways,"[6, 14]","The Thomas Crown Affair (1999 version) stars Pierce Brosnan as Thomas Crown, a bored billionaire art thief, and Rene Russo as Catherine Banning, an insurance investigator who goes after him, then falls in love with him.  Will Catherine do her job and nail Crown for stealing the Monet, or will she throw away her career for a life with her lover as a fugitive?  &quot;Fugitives with means,&quot; Crown tempts Catherine, &quot;that makes all the difference.&quot;When it first came out, I liked this movie better than the original with Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway.  The second time I watched it, wanting to zone out with a caper film, things bothered me almost from the beginning.Don't read any more if you want to see the film, because I'm going to reveal the plot. But  I wanted to figure out what changed in my reactions to the movie, and why (I think) my reactions changed.At a museum in New York a teacher is trying to interest her grade-school students in a painting.  She tells them it's the first Impressionist painting and is unique in the world.  They're bored.  When she tells them &quot;It's worth a hundred million dollars,&quot; they snap to attention, stare, and make noises of awe - -  not articulate speech, but animal sounds of transcendent bliss, like cows or sheep, as though they found themselves in the presence of a millionaire basketball star or pop singer.  In other words, what passes for religious experience in a culture that tolerates ignorance and worships money.Crown has hired Romanian criminals to create a diversion while he personally steals a Monet.  He makes sure the Romanians are caught so he can get away.  He hides  the Monet in his townhouse behind another painting he legitimately owns and spends the evening drinking wine and basking in Monet's genius and his own brilliance.Does Crown deserve to possess the painting because he's rich enough and smart enough to take it?  To be fair, Crown returns the painting almost immediately to the museum in a way that once again proves his superiority, but did he have the right to risk damage to such a masterpiece?  Anyway, my point here is that the first time I saw the move, it didn't even occur to me that Crown didn't have the right to risk the irreplaceable artwork.  Why not?What about the Romanians?  They look like Eastern European movie thugs - -  shaved heads, sneers, but the equipment and tactics they use prove they're not stupid and they're not violent (though one does push a child, a way of making them less sympathetic).  While they knew the risks involved in such a theft when Crown hired them, they didn't know he was going to literally trip them up and send them to prison so he could steal &quot;his&quot; painting from a different room.  Why didn't Crown's betrayal of them even occur to me the first time I saw the movie?We first see insurance investigator Catherine Banning when she picks one of the Romanians to interrogate.  (&quot;Give me the quiet one.&quot;)  Once she sees he understands German, she threatens him with the Securitate, Ceausescu's secret police, playfully walking behind her prisoner and stroking his neck, then pretending to snap it.In this movie people are cattle for the amusement of superhumans like Crown and Catherine, his queen.At this point I realized why these images didn't disturb me the first time I saw the film.  Then I was too busy trying to follow the plot.  In the interrogation scene I was trying to pick out enough German to understand what Catherine was saying.  During the heist at the museum I was trying to figure out the significance of Crown's briefcase and all the other gimmicks involved in the theft.Later, Catherine learns that a young woman she thinks is Crown's girlfriend is really an art forger Crown has put through school.  Why?  Because her father (the young woman's tutor in forgery) is Crown's former partner, now in prison (for work he did for Crown?).  Crown has used his generosity to the young woman to involve her in his scheme.  Maybe she was going to be a forger anyway, but Crown is risking her freedom too.Crown flies Catherine to his private island, where she throws a sealed painting onto the fire to prove she loves him over drinks.  I'm not sure how that proves she loves him.  Crown says it's not the stolen Monet, but a &quot;nice little Renoir.&quot;  Copy or original?  We don't find out for sure.  Again, Crown and Catherine play with irreplaceable art to spice up their erotic games.In the climax we learn that Crown has surreptitiously replaced the Monet, but while he's confounding everyone with an army of look-alikes (their appearance taken from a famous painting) he steals another picture Catherine told him she liked.  (&quot;Everything's obtainable.&quot;)The detective Catherine is working with lets her know he won't chase her if she runs away with Crown.  He can go back to arresting real criminals, instead of looking for stolen art that's really only important to some &quot;silly rich people.&quot;  How many people every year go to the Metropolitan, MOMA, the Louvre, the Orsay, the Pompidou, the Prado, the Reina Sofia, the Uffizi, the Tate,  the Rijksmuseum, just for starters?  How many are rich?At last all the paintings are back where they belong and Crown and Catherine are together.  The first time I was glad for them.  But after Bush's tax cuts, Enron, and Haliburton, people like Tommy and Catherine just aren't as amusing as they used to be.",3,&quot;It's worth a hundred million dollars.&quot;,1078272000,"03 3,

472147,A3NF7KWLQZ4EJI,6305657939,Gabriel,"[3, 3]","Or even marble stairs for that matter...  One of the most prominent remakes of the past decade, The Thomas Crown Affair, is a beautiful, magical, adventure; with Pierce Brosnan in the title role.  Having catapulted into the spotlight with his appearance as James Bond; (The only one I believe that has challenged Connery's hold over the part, but it is Connery afterall and Brosnan takes a cool second.) Brosnan has successfully escaped the role, unlike some of his predecessors, with films such as 'The Thomas Crown Affair' and his latest 'The Tailor Of Panamar'.  He has an ease on the screen that turns sharp when required, and is an absolute joy to watch.The 1999 version has some alterations that had to be made to the 1968 format, for the main reason that the producers wished to bring modern aspects into the film, through the story, they didn't just want to rehash the original.  Thomas Crown's love of life is still ever present, through the representation of a catamaran race, a glider, and an expensive golf swing; His interest in banks has been replaced with a desire for the arts and the 1968 intense chess scene is gone, with a dance in its place and what a night!  Brosnan was upset when one journalist jumped to the assumption that he used a bottom double... he said 'No, it's mine, and I'm quite proud of it!'  It was also a delight to see a Kato 'Pink Panther' type character as Crown's butler, there's no fighting though, and I think it was just my mind going into overtime... it tends to stray.The opening art heist is executed by an Albanian foursome, their entrance is a very old method, that works... and their exit? Well, you'll see.  But are they on their own, or do they have a backer... Indeed, a backer they have and the chase is on.  Rene Russo comes into play as the insurance investigator, Catherine Banning, a resourceful woman with a wealth of worldly experience, however she gets caught up in Crown's world and is forced to make some tough decisions.  Russo is great in the part, an extremely talented actress who has enjoyed many parts coupled to A-List actors.  The film brings with it a pleasure to see Faye Dunaway, appear in a cameo role as Crown's psychiatrist, she is truly one of Hollywood's veteran actresses.  It is a shame that Steve McQueen is not present.The soundtrack is phenomenal and one that I treasure.  Sting heads it up with his version of 'Windmills Of Your Mind', along with songs from Nina Simone, Wasis Diop and Georges Fordant.  Having some South American in my blood, I love the journey that the music takes me on through the course of the film.  Together they are dynamite.  The DVD has a wondrous opening selection screen, and an elaborate commentary with many references to the original film.The Thomas Crown Affair is a Romantic Action Adventure, but how will it all end... will they go away together, will he get caught, or as the original will their likenesses keep them apart... More importantly, will Mr Crown get away with it again... I hope so, but watch and see.",5,I will never look at dancing in the same light...,988416000,"04 28, 2001",2001,3034,"['even', 'marble', 'stairs', 'matter', 'One', 'most', 'prominent', 'remakes', 'past', 'decade', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Affair', 'beautiful', 'magical', 'adventure', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'title', 'role', 'Having', 'catapulted', 'spotlight', 'appearance', 'James', 'Bond', 'only', 'one', 'believe', 'challenged', 'Connery', 'hold', 'part', 'Connery', 'afterall', 'Brosnan', 'cool', 'second', 'Brosnan', 'successfully', 'escaped', 'role', 'predecessors', 'films', 'such', ""'The"", 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Affair', 'latest', 'Tailor', 'Panamar', 'ease', 'screen', 'sharp', 'when', 'required', 'absolute', 'joy', 'watch.The', '1999', 'version', 'alterations', 'had', 'be', 'made', '1968', 'format', 'main', 'reason', 'producers', 'wished', 'bring', 'modern', 'aspects', 'film', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'want', 'rehash', 'original', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'love', 'life', 'still', 'ever', 'present', 'representation', 'catamaran', 'race', 'glider', 'expensive', 'golf', 'swing', 'interest', 'banks', 'been', 'replaced', 'desire', 'arts', '1968', 'intense', 'chess', 'scene', 'gone', 'dance', 'place', 'what', 'night', 'Brosnan', 'was', 'upset', 'when', 'one', 'journalist', 'jumped', 'assumption', 'used', 'bottom', 'double', 'said', 'mine', ""'m"", 'quite', 'proud', 'was', 'also', 'delight', 'see', 'Kato', ""'Pink"", 'Panther', 'type', 'character', 'Crown', 'butler', 'fighting', 'think', 'was', 'just', 'mind', 'going', 'overtime', 'stray.The', 'opening', 'art', 'heist', 'executed', 'Albanian', 'foursome', 'entrance', 'very', 'old', 'method', 'exit', 'Well', ""'ll"", 'see', 'are', 'own', 'do', 'have', 'backer', 'Indeed', 'backer', 'have', 'chase', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'play', 'insurance', 'investigator', 'Catherine', 'Banning', 'resourceful', 'woman', 'wealth', 'worldly', 'experience', 'however', 'caught', 'up', 'Crown', 'world', 'forced', 'make', 'tough', 'decisions', 'Russo', 'great', 'part', 'extremely', 'talented', 'actress', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'parts', 'coupled', 'A-List', 'actors', 'film', 'pleasure', 'see', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'appear', 'cameo', 'role', 'Crown', 'psychiatrist', 'truly', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'veteran', 'shame', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'not', 'present.The', 'soundtrack', 'phenomenal', 'one', 'treasure', 'Sting', 'heads', 'up', 'version', ""'Windmills"", 'Your', 'Mind', 'songs', 'Nina', 'Simone', 'Wasis', 'Diop', 'Georges', 'Fordant', 'Having', 'South', 'American', 'blood', 'love', 'journey', 'music', 'course', 'film', 'are', 'dynamite', 'DVD', 'wondrous', 'opening', 'selection', 'screen', 'elaborate', 'commentary', 'many', 'references', 'original', 'film.The', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Affair', 'Romantic', 'Action', 'Adventure', 'how', 'will', 'end', 'will', 'go', 'away', 'together', 'will', 'get', 'caught', 'original', 'will', 'likenesses', 'keep', 'apart', 'More', 'importantly', 'will', 'Mr', 'Crown', 'get', 'away', 'again', 'hope', 'so', 'watch', 'see']",The Thomas Crown Affair VHS

The soundtrack flows with the story and you will want to watch it over and over again.This is about Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) a super rich finance tycoon that is getting a little bored with life.  He tries to escape boredom throughout the film by engaging in all kinds of extreme activities like speed sailing and flying gliders.  Apparently none of this is fitting the bill and he needs to find something else.Thomas Crown devises a scheme to steal a painting worth $100 million just to see if he can do it.  Enter Catherine Banning (Renee Russo) the insurance investigator sent in to recover the painting.  She quickly surmises it was Crown who stole the painting and tries to catch him.  That is the gist of the movie.The rest of this may contain spoilers.  If you don't want to ruin the movie then don't read any further.Problem for Banning is that Crown is at least 2 steps ahead of her the whole time.  At points he is miles a head of her.  While she is tracking him he manages to return the painting either to hide it in the one place no one would ever look or because he just wanted the thrill of stealing it.  He also manages at some point to steal another.This movie is fun all around.  It is only after you watch the movie a couple of times that you see all of the flaws and there are many.  The thing is it would normally bother me to see this many errors but in this film it is actually fun.  See if you can spot them if not go to the nitpickers website and see for yourself.In the end you probably will come to the conclusion that the original heist and the ending sequence were all just a distraction so that Crown could have someone else steal the other painting while maintaining a perfect alibi.",5,Fun movie flaws and all,1123545600,"08 9, 2005",2005,1797,"['Thomas', 'Crown', 'Affair', 'well', 'scripted', 'well', 'acted', 'fun', 'movie', 'watch', 'soundtrack', 'story', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'again.This', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'super', 'rich', 'finance', 'tycoon', 'getting', 'little', 'bored', 'life', 'escape', 'boredom', 'film', 'engaging', 'kinds', 'extreme', 'activities', 'speed', 'sailing', 'flying', 'gliders', 'Apparently', 'none', 'fitting', 'bill', 'find', 'something', 'else.Thomas', 'Crown', 'scheme', 'steal', 'painting', 'worth', '100', 'million', 'just', 'see', 'can', 'do', 'Enter', 'Catherine', 'Banning', 'Renee', 'Russo', 'insurance', 'investigator', 'sent', 'recover', 'painting', 'quickly', 'surmises', 'was', 'Crown', 'who', 'stole', 'painting', 'tries', 'catch', 'gist', 'movie.The', 'rest', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'movie', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'further.Problem', 'Banning', 'Crown', 'least', '2', 'steps', 'ahead', 'whole', 'time', 'points', 'miles', 'head', 'tracking', 'return', 'painting', 'hide', 'one', 'place', 'one', 'would', 'ever', 'look', 'just', 'wanted', 'thrill', 'stealing', 'also', 'point', 'steal', 'another.This', 'movie', 'fun', 'around', 'only', 'watch', 'movie', 'couple', 'times', 'see', 'flaws', 'are', 'many', 'thing', 'would', 'normally', 'bother', 'see', 'many', 'errors', 'film', 'actually', 'fun', 'See', 'can', 'spot', 'not', 'go', 'nitpickers', 'website', 'see', 'end', 'probably', 'will', 'come', 'conclusion', 'original', 'heist', 'ending', 'sequence', 'were', 'just', 'distraction', 'Crown', 'could', 'have', 'someone', 'else', 'steal', 'other', 'painting', 'maintaining', 'perfect', 'alibi']",The Thomas Crown Affair VHS

Enter Catherine Banning (Rene Russo), the insurance investigator hired to recover the painting. Banning tracks the Monet down to Crown, but the NYPD is hesitant to investigate -- he is one of the museum's patrons, not to mention his political connections. Without a motive, Catherine is left on her own to try to ""get the man who has everything"".It doesn't end there, though. Against conventional wisdom, Banning and Crown fall for each other knowing that they are playing with fire - and the enemy. The deeper they become involved with each other, the tighter the game gets. And when a forgery is found in Crown's flat, things get REAL interesting as Catherine is torn between her duty as an investigator and her feelings for the quiet thrill seeker.Featuring many great action shots, including the grand finale of returning the Monet, this movie will have you riveted to your seat as Brosnan and Russo battle wills and each other in the ""Affair to remember"".",5,An Intriguing Game of Cat and Mouse,1041033600,"12 28, 2002",2002,1406,"['Create', 'diversion', 'here', 'so', 'can', 'steal', 'hundred', 'million', 'wall', 'waltz', 'right', 'out', 'front', 'door', 'Oh', 'good', 'movie', 'VERY', 'good', 'intriguing', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'will', 'have', 'edge', 'seat.Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'up', 'license', 'kill', 'favor', 'finances', 'adventure', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'multi-millionaire', 'who', 'steal', 'priceless', 'Monet', 'broad', 'daylight', 'thrill', 'Enter', 'Catherine', 'Banning', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'insurance', 'investigator', 'hired', 'recover', 'painting', 'Banning', 'Monet', 'down', 'Crown', 'NYPD', 'hesitant', 'investigate', 'one', 'museum', 'patrons', 'not', 'mention', 'political', 'connections', 'motive', 'Catherine', 'left', 'own', 'try', 'get', 'man', 'who', 'everything', '.It', ""n't"", 'end', 'there', 'Against', 'conventional', 'wisdom', 'Banning', 'Crown', 'fall', 'other', 'knowing', 'are', 'playing', 'fire', 'enemy', 'deeper', 'become', 'involved', 'other', 'tighter', 'game', 'when', 'forgery', 'found', 'Crown', 'flat', 'things', 'get', 'REAL', 'interesting', 'Catherine', 'torn', 'duty', 'investigator', 'feelings', 'quiet', 'thrill', 'seeker.Featuring', 'many', 'great', 'action', 'shots', 'including', 'grand', 'finale', 'returning', 'Monet', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'riveted', 'seat', 'Brosnan', 'Russo', 'battle', 'wills', 'other', 'Affair', 'remember']",The Thomas Crown Affair VHS

Many may disagree with me, but I enjoyed it more than the original 1968 movie with Steve McQueen, who I love, and Faye Dunaway. Ms Dunaway does have a cameo role here as Crown's therapistThis is entertainment, with a capital ""E,"" at its best. Nothing deep, or arty, but after a hard day's work, relatively mindless fun is frequently good - even terrific! Thomas Crown, (Brosnan), please allow me to repeat myself, is drop-dead sexy, handsome, rich as Croesus, an expert businessman, cultured, exudes power in a nice-guy (but nevertheless ruthless) kinda way, and he's Available!! I won't go on, but you get the picture. However, as a man who has almost everything, Crown wants some more excitement in his life. He plans, so cleverly, to steal a priceless Monet painting from New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art. Of course he succeeds. Watching the brilliant execution of the theft is worth the price of the rental alone. Crown loves the painting - but he loves the challenge of acquiring it more.Enter the glorious Ms. Russo, called Catherine Banning here. She is a tough, insurance investigator who, as far as pushovers go, was not born yesterday. I read that Russo actually consulted with a professional dominatrix in order to prepare for her role as the aggressive, ever so seductive Ms. Banning. She zeros in on Crown in no time, while turning the NYPD detective heading the case into quivering Jello. He notices, by the way, that apart from being a super detective, she's really easy on the eyes.There are capers - the first one and the last, (with a touch of Magritte), are best. There is love. There's even a remarkable see-through dress, which moves with the body wearing it, to a hot Latin beat; a steamy scene on a staircase; and a fabulous, must-have soundtrack. Most importantly, in a film like this one, the chemistry between Russo and Brosnan is unbelievably outrageous! As in comedy, timing in love and sex is everything - and the timing here is perfect. Both control freaks lose their cool. I must say that everything is done tastefully, with lots of humor. The script is intelligent and witty.I really enjoyed this movie.

The plot centers on Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan), a Donald Trump like businessman who indulges in many exciting and expensive hobbies - racing catamarans, sail planes, golf (with huge side bets) and art theft.  He sets up and pulls off an elaborate theft that sets the NYPD and insurance investigator Catherine Banning (Rene Russo) on his trail.  She quickly sees through his innocent bystander pose and focuses her attentions, both personal and professional, on Crown.  Their affair escalates and vies with the action of the art theft/investigation for the viewers attention.  The tension from both sides of the story continues until the last scene.The style of the film is reminiscent of the original, quick cuts, split screens, rapid pace driven by powerful background music.  Brosnan quickly establishes the character of Crown as powerful, arrogant and wealthy with only a few words of incidental dialogue.  Russo quickly establishes herself as his equal which changes the film from a slick heist film to a romance.  The cinematography is breath takingly beautiful and is backed by a lush music score.The DVD includes both wide-screen and standard formats, English and French subtitles and dubbing, and trailers from both the '68 and '99 versions.  There is also an audio commentary that brings even more to the film.This is definitely a DVD that is worth buying (as opposed to renting) it is one of those films that merits watching again and again, though it is not one for family watching as it is very definitely and deservedly an R rated film.",5,"Round,  like a circle in a spiral",1074384000,"01 18, 2004",2004,1705,"['remake', 'highly', 'rated', 'Steve', 'McQueen/Faye', 'Dunaway', 'film', 'rarest', 'films', 'remake', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'origninal', 'plot', 'centers', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Donald', 'Trump', 'businessman', 'who', 'many', 'exciting', 'expensive', 'hobbies', 'racing', 'catamarans', 'sail', 'planes', 'golf', 'huge', 'side', 'bets', 'art', 'theft', 'up', 'pulls', 'off', 'elaborate', 'theft', 'NYPD', 'insurance', 'investigator', 'Catherine', 'Banning', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'trail', 'quickly', 'innocent', 'bystander', 'pose', 'attentions', 'personal', 'professional', 'Crown', 'affair', 'escalates', 'vies', 'action', 'art', 'theft/investigation', 'viewers', 'attention', 'tension', 'sides', 'story', 'last', 'scene.The', 'style', 'film', 'reminiscent', 'original', 'quick', 'cuts', 'split', 'screens', 'rapid', 'pace', 'driven', 'powerful', 'background', 'music', 'Brosnan', 'quickly', 'character', 'Crown', 'powerful', 'arrogant', 'wealthy', 'only', 'few', 'words', 'incidental', 'dialogue', 'Russo', 'quickly', 'equal', 'film', 'slick', 'heist', 'film', 'romance', 'cinematography', 'breath', 'takingly', 'beautiful', 'backed', 'lush', 'music', 'score.The', 'DVD', 'wide-screen', 'standard', 'formats', 'English', 'French', 'subtitles', 'dubbing', 'trailers', ""'68"", ""'99"", 'versions', 'also', 'audio', 'commentary', 'even', 'more', 'film.This', 'definitely', 'DVD', 'worth', 'buying', 'opposed', 'renting', 'one', 'films', 'watching', 'again', 'again', 'not', 'one', 'family', 'watching', 'very', 'definitely', 'deservedly', 'R', 'rated', 'film']",The Thomas Crown Affair VHS

Thomas Crown (Brosnan) has a vast fortune, an interest in  the finer things in life and strange ways of getting excitement. He is  shown placing huge bets on a single golf stroke and wrecking an expensive  racing yacht just for entertainment.When a priceless painting is stolen  from a museum, he is an immediate suspect.

Even  if you have not seen the original version of this film you can quickly work  out that she and Crown will head for the sack. But why?

Harris ""The Voice of Reason""","[2, 4]","**This is a review of the stand-alone Blu-ray release, not the Blu-ray/DVD combo set**I love a good heist film, and the heist sequences in this film are certainly fun to watch.  Where this film is weakest, however, is during scenes that thrust Rene Russo into the ""sexy femme"" spotlight.Former fashion model Russo is a competent but unexceptional actress.  Too many of her scenes, in particular her scenes in the police department and in the see-through evening gown, are presented with a rather heavy hand.  There might as well have been a big neon sign overhead that read ""This is where we focus on Rene's character's sexual aggressiveness and power"".  Not a hint of subtlety.  Very heavy-handed and, as a result, distracting.  Those are the weakest scenes in the movie.  She is very much objectified, presumably for the sake of having a ""hot over-40 woman"" angle to ""sex up"" the movie as a selling point.  And if you remember the pre-release marketing for this film, that is EXACTLY what the focus was on.As a tribute to the original version of TTCA, Faye Dunaway appears in the small and ultimately unimportant role of Thomas Crown's psychiatrist.  Dunaway's psychiatrist even mocks and laughs at Crown in one scene, a HUGE no-no in the psychiatric community.  All it shows it that her character was thinly written and conceived from the start.  Her character serves no real purpose to the story except as an unnecessary framing device and to satisfy some stunt casting.Believe it or not, the movie's most believable character is the police detective played by Denis Leary.Much attention was given to the love scenes between Brosnan and Russo's characters.  The first one took place largely on a marble floor and marble staircase.  It was meant to be hot and sweat-inducing, but all I could think of during that scene was how uncomfortable it must be to engage in that act on cold, hard marble.I saw the film in the theaters in 1999 and mostly enjoyed it.  As I said, I enjoy a good heist flick.  But I forgot that the heist itself was just a small part of a much longer film, and that the rest of the film has to have some sustainability to it.Watching it again in 2010 on the bargain-priced Blu-ray I purchased from a big box store, it was much less enjoyable.  When the ""will it work or won't it?"" question of the heists has already been answered in the first viewing, it shifts a larger load to the rest of the film:  is it solidly enough made/written to carry the viewer along for the other parts of the ride?  In many instances, no.And some of the product placement was less-than subtle too.  That can often be distracting too.For the film itself and the fact that the Blu-ray is a bare-bones edition with no extra features  (not even the director commentary that is included on the regular DVD), I give it 3 1/2 stars.

472185,A3BU6QT97HMF,6305657939,Joseph Hart,"[3, 12]","This is more a sex movie than any kind of robbery cum cat and mouse game.  To call it a cat and mouse game is absurd, it started out that way and lasted for about 15 minutes, then the clothes came off.  The only good thing I've got to say about it IS the sex, both characters are very natural and childlike about exposing themselves.  This I like.  The first robbery made no  sense except the hero ended up with the Monet.  Then 2 endless hours of romance and tiffs.  (I preferred the detective.)  The plot had a couple surprises.  No more than that.  The water that washed the paint off the Monet would also have damaged it.  The first theft (the hero's part in it) was about as exciting as this flick got except the mix-up with the bowlers and the suitcases at the end, which lasted about 5 minutes or less.  The picture tried hard to be classy and sophisticated, but these sudden decisive or definitive gestures and movements (slapping the keys into the cop's hand, tossing mysterious envelopes into people's laps with a flick or a flourish, etc) all reminded me of the te-da-DUM! on a drum after a joke on the old Carol Burnett Show.  And as for the keys, supposing the hero was deaf and insensate and couldn't hear or feel his keys being taken out of and dropped back into his pocket, how did he drive our heroine to the restaurant without them?

472186,A34D06JL7LC6MU,6305657939,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 1]","""The Thomas Crown Affair"" is a remake of an older film I've never seen and stars the former James Bond, Pierce Brosnan as the title character. This is the perfect role for Brosnan, because he's better suited as a smart and sophisticated millionaire than an action hero. The movie is smart, plausible, entertaining, and the performances are very suave. As I said, Brosnan plays Thomas Crown; a millionaire who's life really isn't very fun...So, Crown decides to steal a painting from a museum that's worth 100 Million dollars.Crown, however, is not stealing the painting for what it's worth but merely for the excitement of doing it. The actual theft of the painting is really entertaining and pretty damned plausible. After he steals the painting, the cops begin investigating as well as an insurance investigator named Catherine Banning (Rene Russo), who's willing to do anything to find this painting. One thing Crown longs for (as it's explained in his therapy sessions) is a female equal to himself and Catherine has enough determination and smarts to fill that. Well, eventually Crown and Catherine begin an affair (and I must say, that for a woman in her forties Russo looks incredible) that appears to be only about sex. Neither one of them are entirely sure if they can trust one another. Comedian Denis Leary ('Rescue Me' & 'Jesus' Son') plays Michael, a detective working on the case along with Catherine. But, Brosnan and Russo really light up the screen. They play the characters better than anybody I could think of and they actually have charisma on screen, which makes it all the more better. This movie isn't a masterpiece but it is entertaining and exciting and worth watching.GRADE: A-",5,Entertaining and Smart,1148256000,"05 22, 2006",2006,1703,"['Thomas', 'Crown', 'Affair', 'remake', 'older', 'film', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'former', 'James', 'Bond', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'title', 'character', 'perfect', 'role', 'Brosnan', 'better', 'suited', 'smart', 'sophisticated', 'millionaire', 'action', 'hero', 'movie', 'smart', 'plausible', 'entertaining', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'suave', 'said', 'Brosnan', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'millionaire', 'who', 'life', 'really', ""n't"", 'very', 'fun', 'So', 'Crown', 'steal', 'painting', 'museum', 'worth', '100', 'Million', 'dollars.Crown', 'however', 'not', 'stealing', 'painting', 'what', 'worth', 'merely', 'excitement', 'doing', 'actual', 'theft', 'painting', 'really', 'entertaining', 'pretty', 'damned', 'plausible', 'painting', 'cops', 'begin', 'investigating', 'as', 'well', 'insurance', 'investigator', 'named', 'Catherine', 'Banning', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'who', 'willing', 'do', 'anything', 'find', 'painting', 'One', 'thing', 'Crown', 'longs', 'explained', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'female', 'equal', 'Catherine', 'enough', 'determination', 'smarts', 'fill', 'Well', 'eventually', 'Crown', 'Catherine', 'begin', 'affair', 'must', 'say', 'woman', 'forties', 'Russo', 'incredible', 'be', 'only', 'sex', 'one', 'are', 'entirely', 'sure', 'can', 'trust', 'one', 'Comedian', 'Denis', 'Leary', 'Me', ""'Jesus"", 'Son', 'plays', 'Michael', 'detective', 'working', 'case', 'Catherine', 'Brosnan', 'Russo', 'really', 'light', 'up', 'screen', 'play', 'characters', 'better', 'anybody', 'could', 'think', 'actually', 'have', 'charisma', 'screen', 'more', 'better', 'movie', ""n't"", 'masterpiece', 'entertaining', 'exciting', 'worth', 'watching.GRADE', 'A-']",The Thomas Crown Affair VHS

Just because he &#147;likes it&#148; he happens to collect priceless works of art&#133; illegally. Enter super-sexy, beautifully chic and extra smartRene Russo, as the woman who will &#147;get him&#148;, in more ways than one.&#147;The Thomas Crown affair&#148; is a re-make of the film of the same name that Steve McQueen starred in during the sixties. Not having seen that version, I have to admit this one in particular has all the style, glamour and cache of the high life everybody wants to follow but, sadly, not everybody gets. Pierce Brosnan is not a versatile actor, but roles like this, where he can display his slender persona and gallant ways, suit him as a tailored grey flannel ensemble done by the most excellent fashion expert. Speaking of fashion, his counterpart, Rene Russo, surprises and enchants in her Celine wardrobe and Bvlgari jewels. Russo certainly shows off as beautiful as ever and with all the quick wit and classy manners of a female James Bond.No expense in this movie was spared, the rides in Crown&#146;s Jaguar, dinner at Ciprianni&#146;s (with no previous reservation), weekend away in the privacy of one&#146;s own villa in Martinique, windsurfing and more.

472196,AHRSDAKFHXEUX,6305657939,kentuckyreader,"[3, 3]","This movie creates its own little world, and successfully never leaves it.  We get a window into the very posh world of the upper crust, without ever being belabored with the arctic brutality that is sometimes exhibited by that class (a term which sometimes seems ironic).  But this movie isn't really about that ... that is merely the story's terrain.The movie is full of things to like.  Brosnan's Thomas Crown very successfully lives up to being compared at the beginning to Odysseus (a character Homer described as a man who was &quot;never at a loss&quot;).  He is elegant and poised, regardless of the circumstances. His ability to always be in control and remain unruffled seems the source of his ennui, which pushes him into seeking danger just for the thrill.Russo is very formidable, which is in of itself refreshing for a Hollywood film.  She also proves right down to the skin that a woman does not have to be 21 to be beautiful.The photography and use of color assist in luring you into the movie's comfortable little world:  you simply cannot take your eyes off the color of the muted lighting in the restaurant, the details in a person's skin, or the sharp clarity of the fabric of a shirt-cuff.  The photography makes you *feel* what Crown's world feels like.And, typical of McTiernan films, there is no such thing as an &quot;extra.&quot;  Everyone we bump into is a very real, flesh and blood person who just doesn't happen to be the subject of the plot.But best of all is Crown's incredible skill at the art of deception.  Through forethought, methodical planning, and with a knowledge of misdirection, he's always tantalizingly just out of reach.In using these skills to relieve boredom, he meets someone he considers more valuable than his little kingdom.  Smartly, the film shows that Crown has to use his skills, and risk imprisonment, to get himself out of the trouble he created and ultimately to acquire what he really wants.This can really be seen as a morality play about people who love wealth and games, and then discover that those things don't fill the void inside - then, each must risk something to acquire something more important:  love.Russo's character proposes the question, &quot;Do you think there's happily-ever-after for people like us?&quot;  The film seems to answer &quot;yes&quot; - but it also suggests, like another film about a thief (Douglas Fairbanks' &quot;Thief of Bagdad&quot;), that happiness must be earned, not stolen.",4,Very Slick Little Fantasy!!,995932800,"07 24, 2001",2001,2476,"['movie', 'own', 'little', 'world', 'successfully', 'never', 'get', 'window', 'very', 'posh', 'world', 'upper', 'crust', 'ever', 'being', 'belabored', 'arctic', 'brutality', 'sometimes', 'exhibited', 'class', 'term', 'sometimes', 'ironic', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'merely', 'story', 'terrain.The', 'movie', 'full', 'things', 'like', 'Brosnan', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'very', 'successfully', 'up', 'being', 'compared', 'beginning', 'Odysseus', 'character', 'Homer', 'described', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'quot', 'never', 'loss', 'quot', 'elegant', 'poised', 'regardless', 'circumstances', 'ability', 'always', 'be', 'control', 'remain', 'unruffled', 'source', 'ennui', 'seeking', 'danger', 'just', 'thrill.Russo', 'very', 'formidable', 'refreshing', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'also', 'right', 'down', 'skin', 'woman', 'not', 'have', 'be', '21', 'be', 'beautiful.The', 'photography', 'use', 'color', 'assist', 'luring', 'movie', 'comfortable', 'little', 'world', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'take', 'eyes', 'color', 'muted', 'lighting', 'restaurant', 'details', 'person', 'skin', 'sharp', 'clarity', 'fabric', 'shirt-cuff', 'photography', '*feel*', 'what', 'Crown', 'world', 'feels', 'like.And', 'typical', 'McTiernan', 'films', 'such', 'thing', 'quot', 'quot', 'Everyone', 'bump', 'very', 'real', 'flesh', 'blood', 'person', 'who', 'just', ""n't"", 'happen', 'be', 'subject', 'plot.But', 'best', 'Crown', 'incredible', 'skill', 'art', 'deception', 'forethought', 'methodical', 'planning', 'knowledge', 'misdirection', 'always', 'tantalizingly', 'just', 'reach.In', 'using', 'skills', 'relieve', 'boredom', 'someone', 'more', 'valuable', 'little', 'kingdom', 'Smartly', 'film', 'Crown', 'use', 'skills', 'risk', 'imprisonment', 'get', 'trouble', 'created', 'ultimately', 'acquire', 'what', 'really', 'wants.This', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'seen', 'morality', 'play', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'wealth', 'games', 'then', 'discover', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'fill', 'void', 'then', 'must', 'risk', 'something', 'acquire', 'something', 'more', 'important', 'love.Russo', 'character', 'question', 'quot', 'Do', 'think', 'happily-ever-after', 'people', 'quot', 'film', 'answer', 'quot', 'quot', 'also', 'film', 'thief', 'Douglas', 'Fairbanks', 'quot', 'Thief', 'Bagdad', 'quot', 'happiness', 'must', 'be', 'earned', 'not', 'stolen']",The Thomas Crown Affair VHS

As many are aware, this 1999 movie is a remake of the 1968 original starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway, a movie that I haven't taken the time to watch yet but this remake certainly prompts one to do so.  The on screen relationship between Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo is one of those rare ones that works extremely well when combined with an intriguing script; all making for an excellent movie watching experience.The performances given by Mr. James Bond himself, Pierce Brosnan and by Rene Russo were perfect for this movie.  I've heard many people state that the topless scenes with Rene Russo were gratuitous for this movie, which is an opinion I do not share.  It fits easily with her character that has spent a fair amount of time in Europe which could easily lessen ones shyness about such things.  Denis Leary's performance in this movie was pretty much on par with his past performances.Director John McTiernan, known for several big movies such as &quot;The Hunt for Red October,&quot; &quot;Predator&quot; and &quot;Die Hard,&quot; does a wonderful job of making &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; in his vision, an even bigger movie than the script calls for.  Everything about this great heist movie is thrilling in its sleekness and style making it an enjoyable film whether it be the first or the fifth time you've watched it and much of the credit for that goes to director John McTiernan and the performances given by Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo.The Premise:Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) is an extraordinarily wealthy business man who has become too bored with life and has found a way to bring a bit of a thrill to it by engineering the perfect crime; stealing a painting worth one hundred million dollars from a New York gallery.  In comes, Catherine Olds Banning (Rene Russo) who works for the insurers of that painting and her mission is to find the thief and the painting...What follows from there is one of the most ingenious heist/caper movies that I've watched in quite some time that, for the first time viewer, will certainly have you on the edge of your seat as director John McTiernan takes you through the paces of the script, wondering if Thomas Crown will be caught and lose all or will he get away with his &quot;perfect&quot; crime.I highly recommend this film to any and all who are fans of films within this genre!  {ssintrepid}Special Features:-Feature Length Audio Commentary by John McTiernan-Collectible Booklet-Theatrical Trailers from both the 1968 and 1999 films",5,The Thomas Crown Affair - An excellent heist/caper film!,1076112000,"02 7, 2004",2004,2618,"['very', 'little', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'gem', 'genre', 'heist/caper', 'movies', 'many', 'are', 'aware', '1999', 'movie', 'remake', '1968', 'original', 'starring', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'taken', 'time', 'watch', 'yet', 'remake', 'certainly', 'one', 'do', 'so', 'screen', 'relationship', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'one', 'rare', 'ones', 'extremely', 'well', 'when', 'combined', 'intriguing', 'script', 'making', 'excellent', 'movie', 'watching', 'experience.The', 'performances', 'given', 'Mr.', 'James', 'Bond', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'were', 'perfect', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'many', 'people', 'state', 'topless', 'scenes', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'were', 'gratuitous', 'movie', 'opinion', 'do', 'not', 'share', 'easily', 'character', 'spent', 'fair', 'amount', 'time', 'Europe', 'could', 'easily', 'lessen', 'ones', 'shyness', 'such', 'things', 'Denis', 'Leary', 'performance', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'par', 'past', 'performances.Director', 'John', 'McTiernan', 'known', 'several', 'big', 'movies', 'such', 'quot', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'quot', 'quot', 'Predator', 'quot', 'quot', 'Die', 'Hard', 'quot', 'wonderful', 'job', 'making', 'quot', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Affair', 'quot', 'vision', 'even', 'bigger', 'movie', 'script', 'Everything', 'great', 'heist', 'movie', 'thrilling', 'sleekness', 'style', 'making', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'be', 'first', 'fifth', 'time', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'much', 'credit', 'director', 'John', 'McTiernan', 'performances', 'given', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Rene', 'Russo.The', 'Premise', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'extraordinarily', 'wealthy', 'business', 'man', 'who', 'become', 'too', 'bored', 'life', 'found', 'way', 'bring', 'bit', 'thrill', 'engineering', 'perfect', 'crime', 'stealing', 'painting', 'one', 'hundred', 'million', 'dollars', 'New', 'York', 'gallery', 'Catherine', 'Olds', 'Banning', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'who', 'insurers', 'painting', 'mission', 'find', 'thief', 'painting', 'What', 'one', 'most', 'ingenious', 'heist/caper', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'quite', 'time', 'first', 'time', 'viewer', 'will', 'certainly', 'have', 'edge', 'seat', 'director', 'John', 'McTiernan', 'paces', 'script', 'wondering', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'will', 'be', 'caught', 'lose', 'will', 'get', 'away', 'quot', 'perfect', 'quot', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'films', 'genre', 'ssintrepid', 'Special', 'Features', '-Feature', 'Length', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'John', 'McTiernan-Collectible', 'Booklet-Theatrical', 'Trailers', '1968', '1999', 'films']",The Thomas Crown Affair VHS

But no, Thomas is unmoved. Bobby presses and tells him it's worth a cool $100 million dollars. But again - Thomas is not impressed. Crown then sighs - and staring with great discipline at the Van Gogh immediately in front of him - he says, ""It's nice Bobby. It is. But I like my haystacks..."" The Security Guard smiles, shrugs his shoulders and walks away admiring Thomas Crown's honesty.A few hours later a 20th Century Greco Asian Horse arrives in a pallet downstairs instead of an Etruscan Sarcophagus - a 'disparity' perhaps? Or perhaps Bobby needs to go to character assessment classes more often...In 1998 Pierce Brosnan and his production company ""Irish Dreamtime"" wisely decided to remake the sophisticated 1969 playboy heist movie ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" which originally starred Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway - cleverly giving Dunaway the part of Crown's therapist in the new version. It was a genius move. Already beginning to be straight-jacketed by Bond, Brosnan showed that not only could he pull off a leading man in another film, but he could do it with more style and panache than most of Hollywood's elite. Remake or no - the result was a critical and commercial winner that sizzled with both sex and sexiness.Containing both of these - and a great deal more - up steps the movie's other secret weapon - actress Rene Russo playing a super-savvy Insurance Agent called Catherine Banning. The chemistry between her and Brosnan was so sensational it set tongues wagging globally (""Will you get me? Oh I hope so...""). But with all of this loaded dialogue - promptly followed by sweaty shenanigans on the marble staircase - the movie desperately needed some serious grounding and the occasional laugh. For this they added in the wonderful Denis Leary as Detective Michael McCann (...""some of these broads are wearing my salary..."") and Frankie Faison as his partner Detective Paretti. Their sparring with the smarter Russo character (some of her dialogue titles this review) is magical and so deftly handled.Also blessed with a brilliantly-written and cleverly plotted script by Lesley Dixon and Kurt Wilmer, great original music by Bill Conti and expert Direction by John McTiernan - ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" was quite rightly hailed as a fantastic piece of cinema.Which brings us to this BLU RAY reissue. Its default aspect is 2.35:1 (bars on the top and bottom), but even stretched to full screen - it holds its shape, is detailed and clean. I'm also thrilled to say that the picture upgrade is obvious even as the credits roll. It never looks anything less than great and at times (close-ups of suits, faces in restaurants, her slinky gowns) it looks beautiful. Even in the Museum Basement sequences - which are dark and faintly lit - the print is still superbly clear.Niggles - the Blu Ray is an American-only issue at the moment, but it is an 'all regions' disc - which means it plays on all players. Some have found that this isn't the case, but it did on my mine without any fuss whatsoever - so check your machine. The other major let down is the complete absence of any extras - not even a trailer. But - by way of small consolation - the disc is mid-price so can be had for less than a tenner...To sum up - 12-years haven't diminished the entertainment value of this fantastic remake one jot. And despite the disappointing lack of extras - the truly superb upgrade in picture quality and reasonable price - should convince fans and newcomers alike to put this Blu Ray repurchase high on their wish list. Great stuff.I'm off now to capsize my yacht and run off with that moll from the insurance company with the Route 66 legs and Mick Jagger lips (as you do)...BLU RAY Specifications:Picture: 2.35:1

While Pierce Brosnan doesn't make my list of leading men (though it's not like he's inquired), he was well cast - or maybe I just like his swagger.  And the opening bit with Faye Dunaway is a stroke of genius both in the casting and in the scripting.The nuances make this movie - the sex stuff is obvious, the chemistry works, and many have commented on that below - what was great was the pacing, starting with the opening business deal. Brosnan signs a document, Cigar smoking fat cat weighs in: ""Deuce! Times in this thing I'd never thought I'd see that! Thomas Crown forced to sell something. So what do you think Crown, you don't have any regrets about the way you played this, do ya? Response (and yes, I love this): ""Regret is usually a waste of time. As is gloating. Figure out what you're going to say to your board when they learn that you paid me $30M more than others were offering."" Transition to music taps, taps, more taps, and then segue into the Trojan horse (for those of you who remember or were struck by this). Weave in the Magritte bowler hat backdrop and NYC landscape, the yacht gliding and crashing, and the fact that Rene Russo makes the corners of his not-so-easily-entertained mouth turn up, I can pretty much overlook any of this movie's shortcomings.

472229,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305657939,Matthew Horner,"[3, 3]","For a movie to succeed as mere entertainment, as simply a refreshment, it had better be good. The Thomas Crown Affair is very good. It is sophisticated, it is amusing, and it is sexy. It is also what they used to refer to as adult. Of course, the meaning of that word in reference to film and video has changed a lot in the last twenty years. So, I mean it in an old-fashioned sense.The Thomas Crown Affair is a remake of a very successful 1968 movie. The story has been updated, and some changes have been made which I think make it a better movie. The original starred Steve McQueen, who was 38 at the time, and Faye Dunaway, who was 27. Today's stars, Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo, are both 45. This change proved to be a key to success. It takes an older woman to be as worldly as the clever and talented Thomas Crown.Thomas Crown [Brosnan] has it all, He is handsome, educated and enormously wealthy. Yet, Mr. Crown is easily bored, and the only way he can get through life successfully is to make a game out of it. One of these games is about to be played, and we've been invited to watch. Thomas is preparing to rip off a $100,000,000 painting from New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. The first twenty minutes of the movie are about the theft, and while it is interesting, it is fairly similar to a score of other movie heists. It is when Catherine Banning [Rene Russo] first appears that things start to sizzle. Catherine, daughter of a bounty hunter, works for the insurance company that stands to lose a lot of money. Catherine seems willing to do about anything to get her theif. She, too, makes a game out of life.Working with the NYPD, it doesn't take long for Crown to become Catherine's prime suspect. But, where is the proof? Where is the painting? Best of all, where is the motive? It takes a Catherine to understand that sometimes the motive is the game itself. She decides to get to know Thomas Crown, and she gets to know him very well. At first, she tries to maintain some professional ethics. When these don't work, she blithely throws them out. What she can't find out vertically, she can try to find out horizontally. Yet, this decision leads to problems. Thomas is as good an investigator as she is, while she is as much of a scoundrel as he it. It all becomes a very elaborate game, and it gets very interesting when the pair starts to bond with each other emotionally.It is remarkable that, in a culture obsessed with youth, the hottest screen couple of the year is middle-aged. True, Ms. Russo and Mr. Brosnan are in great shape. He is, after all, the current James Bond. Still, it is this pair, who are as close to 65 as they are to 25, that show us what a torrid affair is really like. And it is this element that makes The Thomas Crown Affair so successful. This couple simply has a magnetism and a knowledge that simply doesn't exist in a pair of twenty-year olds. You'll simply have to see it to understand what I mean. In any case, this was the best romantic crime caper of 1999.",4,"Sexy, sultry remake of classic 1968 crime thrillerFor a movi",1016582400,"03 20, 2002",2002,3017,"['movie', 'succeed', 'mere', 'entertainment', 'simply', 'refreshment', 'had', 'better', 'be', 'good', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Affair', 'very', 'good', 'sophisticated', 'amusing', 'sexy', 'also', 'what', 'used', 'refer', 'adult', 'course', 'meaning', 'word', 'reference', 'film', 'video', 'changed', 'lot', 'last', 'twenty', 'years', 'So', 'mean', 'old-fashioned', 'sense.The', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Affair', 'remake', 'very', 'successful', '1968', 'movie', 'story', 'been', 'updated', 'changes', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'think', 'make', 'better', 'movie', 'original', 'starred', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'who', 'was', '38', 'time', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'who', 'was', '27', 'Today', 'stars', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'are', '45', 'change', 'proved', 'be', 'key', 'success', 'older', 'woman', 'be', 'as', 'worldly', 'clever', 'talented', 'Thomas', 'Crown.Thomas', 'Crown', '[', 'Brosnan', ']', 'handsome', 'educated', 'enormously', 'wealthy', 'Mr.', 'Crown', 'easily', 'bored', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'get', 'life', 'successfully', 'make', 'game', 'One', 'games', 'be', 'played', ""'ve"", 'been', 'invited', 'watch', 'Thomas', 'preparing', 'rip', 'off', '100,000,000', 'painting', 'New', 'York', 'Metropolitan', 'Museum', 'Art', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'movie', 'are', 'theft', 'interesting', 'fairly', 'similar', 'score', 'other', 'movie', 'heists', 'when', 'Catherine', 'Banning', '[', 'Rene', 'Russo', ']', 'first', 'things', 'start', 'sizzle', 'Catherine', 'daughter', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'insurance', 'company', 'lose', 'lot', 'money', 'Catherine', 'willing', 'do', 'about', 'anything', 'get', 'theif', 'too', 'game', 'life.Working', 'NYPD', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'Crown', 'become', 'Catherine', 'prime', 'suspect', 'where', 'proof', 'Where', 'painting', 'Best', 'where', 'motive', 'Catherine', 'understand', 'motive', 'game', 'get', 'know', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'know', 'very', 'well', 'first', 'maintain', 'professional', 'ethics', 'When', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'blithely', 'out', 'What', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'vertically', 'can', 'try', 'find', 'out', 'horizontally', 'decision', 'problems', 'Thomas', 'as', 'good', 'investigator', 'as', 'much', 'scoundrel', 'very', 'elaborate', 'game', 'very', 'interesting', 'when', 'pair', 'bond', 'other', 'emotionally.It', 'remarkable', 'culture', 'obsessed', 'youth', 'hottest', 'screen', 'couple', 'year', 'middle-aged', 'True', 'Ms.', 'Russo', 'Mr.', 'Brosnan', 'are', 'great', 'shape', 'current', 'James', 'Bond', 'Still', 'pair', 'who', 'are', 'close', '65', 'are', '25', 'show', 'what', 'torrid', 'affair', 'really', 'like', 'element', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Affair', 'so', 'successful', 'couple', 'simply', 'magnetism', 'knowledge', 'simply', ""n't"", 'exist', 'pair', 'twenty-year', 'olds', ""'ll"", 'simply', 'have', 'see', 'understand', 'what', 'mean', 'case', 'was', 'best', 'romantic', 'crime', 'caper', '1999']",The Thomas Crown Affair VHS
472230,ARF5OI5V9OI00,6305657939,Max A. Lebow,"[1, 3]","SPOILER ALERTThe ending of this 118-minute marvel seems an almost foregone conclusion. The bored billionaire did it. However, he and the sexy insurance detective play with each other until the audience is very, very hot. Pierce Brosnan, the billionaire, still sexist from his stint as James Bond, enjoys playing with the lady, Renee Russo. And she, as the tough but sexy Catherine Olds Banning, loses her heart to him, as much heart as such a sexpot character is allowed. In the process, she shows some very appealing nipples.The 1968 version, of which this is a remake, starred Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway. In this version, to the socially irresponsible, self-absorbed 90s are ever present. We don't mind not having the suspense, we just yearn to see Brosnan and Russo ""get it on."" Dunaway appears as a psychiatrist who is trying to help the billionaire figure out why he is so socially irresponsible.Brosnan, as Thomas Crown, is bored, but open to being titillated by a beautiful woman, for as long as he is interested in her. For thrills, he steals priceless works of art from publicly-funded museums. The film makes it clear he can do so, under the noses of  security guards, police, and hundreds of innocent art-lovers. Russo's insurance company insured the painting, so she is looking to recover the irreplaceable, but impossible to fence Monet, and save her employer a bundle.What we have here is a film with clever dialog, rich and exotic sets, and loads of sexual tension. One wonders now, after Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, and other corporate heists, just whom Brosnan is cheating in order to support his high-tech heist brigade. How many of his employees are going to lose their pensions or health care benefits over this. He never really, you know, works. But I digress.Dennis Leary has a character role as the streetwise New York detective, who advises Russo's Banning.

And...here's the biggest shocker of all...it's among the rarest of breeds, a remake that is actually BETTER  than its predecessor, and still respectful of said predecessor (see Faye  Dunaway's well-placed cameo as Thomas Crown's psychiatrist as proof of this  respect).Everything clicks in this film: the acting is first-rate, from  Pierce Brosnan and the ever-hot Rene Russo on down to Denis Leary (who  turns in perhaps the best performance of the film as a good cop - a  definite break from his more typical roles).The music is also superb -  Bill Conti, often maligned for his contributions to the Rocky series as  well as the atypically disco-influenced Bond score in For Your Eyes Only,  turns in an amazing set of compositions that go very well with what we see  on screen.  (Sadly, though, the soundtrack album leaves out many of these  compositions...another story for another time).But perhaps the ultimate  success of The Thomas Crown Affair can be attributed to John McTiernan, the  genius behind Die Hard and The Hunt For Red October.  McTiernan gives us a  visually resplendent picture on all levels - the scenery, the quality of  the picture, and the framing (if you'll forgive the pun) of certain scenes,  especially the museum scenes where Thomas Crown both steals and puts back  the priceless works of art - which makes The Thomas Crown Affair a  particular pleasure to watch on DVD (this was one of my very first DVD  acquisitions, and...at least among my burgeoning collection...it is far and  away the DVD that takes best advantage of the new technology's enhanced  capabilities).This is very enjoyable fare that is difficult not to  enjoy, even with skeptics of Hollywood - namely myself - included...and it  is most definitely light years better than the contemporaneous look-alike  (but not made-alike) &quot;Entrapment&quot;.

So, when my wife rented a copy of the 1999 remake of &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair,&quot; (the original being that 1968 classic heist film starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway), I found myself predisposed to return it the video store unwatched. That, despite the fact that everything I had previously heard about the movie made it sound pretty good! Reluctantly, I decided to go ahead and sit through it...and am I ever glad I did!Thomas Crown, is a man who has it all. He's a smart, sophisticated Wall Street financier, worth multi-billions of dollars. He owns his own holding company, a New York skyscraper, and a gorgeous town house filled with art treasures. He has everything a man could ask for...except a challenge in life. He's bored. And he's always on the lookout for the ultimate thrill...In order to find that greatest of all thrills, he enlists a little help from a trio of Eastern European accomplices and pulls off a daring daytime theft of a priceless painting from a New York art museum.Enter Catherine Banning, an insurance investigator for &quot;a couple of guys from Zurich who don't want to just write a 100 million dollar check&quot; for the stolen painting. She's just as smart, sophisticated, and savvy as Crown, and equally eager for the next great challenge, the ultimate thrill. She immediately suspects that Crown is the mastermind behind the theft, and she will stop at nothing to get that painting back...including seducing her prime suspect. Soon, Crown and Banning find themselves collision course of sex, suspicion, ambition, jealousy, and betrayal......I won't give away any more of the plot. It is sufficient to say that the movie takes many a suspenseful and enjoyable twist and turn on its way to a surprisingly unpredictable outcome.Needless to say, I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair.&quot; In fact, I thought it was as good as the 1968 McQueen/Dunaway version. It is a taut, suspenseful film tinged with humor and wit The acting is good throughout. Renee Russo dominates the film with her splendid performance as the canny and sensual insurance investigator. Pierce Brosnan's portrayal of Thomas Crown is good, but certainly less intense and satisfying than Russo's characterization of Banning. The chemistry between Russo and Brosnan is enhanced by sharp, witty dialogue and the highly sensual scenes shared by these two attractive actors. However, their on-screen chemistry tended to suffer on a few occasions, when Brosnan seemed almost passive next to Russo. Denis Leary was excellent in his role as the highly intelligent and sensitive police detective Mike McCann, as was Faye Dunaway in her cameo appearance as Thomas Crown's therapist.At the end of a Friday evening of movie watching, with the ending credits of 1999's &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; beginning to roll, I had to admit: my wife had really picked out a very good movie this time!

472249,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,6305657939,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[13, 14]","Generally speaking, I'm not a great fan of remakes and stepping into Hollywood legend Steve McQueen's shoes in what many considered to be a classic film would perhaps seem like an odd career move. However, Pierce Brosnan pulls it off with great style and I would go as far to say that although Pierce Brosnan may never reach the iconic status of Hollywood wild man Steve McQueen, this movie not only easily surpasses what was an over-rated original but it was also one of the best cinematic releases of 1999.The plot of the original movie has been given a total makeover. Whereas in the original 1968 version, Steve McQueen organised a $2 million bank robbery, in a very 60's blow against the system, Brosnan pulls off an art robbery single handed, walking out a museum with a Monet painting worth fifty times the amount. However, the essence of the original movie has been retained, and revolves around a tough-nosed female insurance investigator conducting an ambiguous love affair (Rene Russo) with  millionaire playboy Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan), whilst at the same time trying to trap her seemingly uncatchable quarry.Conceived as a star vehicle between Bond movies by Pierce Brosnan's very own  Dreamtime Films as the perfect vehicle for his 007-buffed persona, the script underwent several rewrites, including ditching the script that later became the rival and disappointing Sean Connery/Catherine Zeta Jones movie `Entrapment'. And whereas Steve McQueen was surprisingly entirely cast against type in the 1968 original, the role of rugged bored playboy Thomas Crown fits Brosnan to an absolute tee. It is also to Director John McTiernan and Pierce Brosnan's credit that (the then) 45 year old Russo was cast opposite Brosnan in the role originally made famous by Faye Dunaway, unlike the ridiculous and almost sickening pairing of Grandfather Sean Connery and the young enough to be his granddaughter Catherine Zeta Jones in rival production `Entrapment'. Russo looks wonderful for her age and the sexual chemistry between her and Brosnan is excellent. As for John McTiernan (the top notch action Director behind such successful movies as Die Hard, Predator and The Hunt For Red October, Die Hard With A Vengeance) he doesn't try to copy the original in any way shape or form and thankfully avoids the split screen gimmickery of the original and instead replaces it with a much more glossy, snappy and modern style perfect for the movie.All in all this is an excellent caper movie with plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing and keep you happy. Well worth watching and well worth owning, this is one of the first titles I bought on DVD and if you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it.",4,SUPERIOR ROMANTIC THRILLER!!!,1013385600,"02 11, 2002",2002,2707,"['Generally', 'speaking', ""'m"", 'not', 'great', 'fan', 'remakes', 'stepping', 'Hollywood', 'legend', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'shoes', 'what', 'many', 'considered', 'be', 'classic', 'film', 'would', 'perhaps', 'seem', 'odd', 'career', 'move', 'However', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'off', 'great', 'style', 'would', 'go', 'far', 'say', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'may', 'never', 'reach', 'iconic', 'status', 'Hollywood', 'wild', 'man', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'easily', 'what', 'was', 'over-rated', 'original', 'was', 'also', 'one', 'best', 'cinematic', 'releases', '1999.The', 'plot', 'original', 'movie', 'been', 'given', 'total', 'makeover', 'Whereas', 'original', '1968', 'version', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'organised', '2', 'million', 'bank', 'robbery', 'very', '60', 'blow', 'system', 'Brosnan', 'art', 'robbery', 'single', 'handed', 'walking', 'out', 'museum', 'Monet', 'painting', 'worth', 'fifty', 'times', 'amount', 'However', 'essence', 'original', 'movie', 'been', 'retained', 'around', 'tough-nosed', 'female', 'insurance', 'investigator', 'conducting', 'ambiguous', 'love', 'affair', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'millionaire', 'playboy', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'whilst', 'same', 'time', 'trying', 'trap', 'seemingly', 'uncatchable', 'quarry.Conceived', 'star', 'vehicle', 'Bond', 'movies', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'very', 'own', 'Dreamtime', 'Films', 'perfect', 'vehicle', '007-buffed', 'persona', 'script', 'underwent', 'several', 'rewrites', 'including', 'ditching', 'script', 'later', 'became', 'rival', 'disappointing', 'Sean', 'Connery/Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'movie', 'Entrapment', 'whereas', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'entirely', 'cast', 'type', '1968', 'original', 'role', 'rugged', 'bored', 'playboy', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Brosnan', 'absolute', 'tee', 'also', 'Director', 'John', 'McTiernan', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'credit', 'then', '45', 'year', 'old', 'Russo', 'was', 'cast', 'opposite', 'Brosnan', 'role', 'originally', 'made', 'famous', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'ridiculous', 'almost', 'sickening', 'pairing', 'Grandfather', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'young', 'enough', 'be', 'granddaughter', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'rival', 'production', 'Entrapment', 'Russo', 'wonderful', 'age', 'sexual', 'chemistry', 'Brosnan', 'excellent', 'John', 'McTiernan', 'top', 'notch', 'action', 'Director', 'such', 'successful', 'movies', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Predator', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'Die', 'Hard', 'A', 'Vengeance', ""n't"", 'try', 'copy', 'original', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'thankfully', 'split', 'screen', 'gimmickery', 'original', 'instead', 'replaces', 'much', 'more', 'glossy', 'snappy', 'modern', 'style', 'perfect', 'movie.All', 'excellent', 'caper', 'movie', 'plenty', 'twists', 'keep', 'guessing', 'keep', 'happy', 'Well', 'watching', 'well', 'worth', 'owning', 'one', 'first', 'titles', 'bought', 'DVD', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'highly', 'recommend']",The Thomas Crown Affair VHS

472252,A1S0TB8S4Y7CIQ,6305657939,Nicholas Stix,"[4, 8]","I so expected to be disappointed by this remake of Norman Jewison's jazzy, quintessentially 60's caper film. And boy, was I ""disappointed""! The Rene Russo, er Thomas Crown Affair, is AS GOOD as the original.The original has rebellious Steve McQueen, playing a role few people would have believed he could handle -- that of cool-as-a-cucumber, Harvard-trained financier, ""Tommy Crown."" (To Pierce Brosnan: I knew Steve McQueen, he was a friend of mine, and Mr. Brosnan, you're no Steve McQueen!)The original has Faye Dunaway as ""Vicky Anderson."" (Going in, I was tempted to say to Rene Russo, I know Faye Dunaway, ... but we'll get to that.)The original has that jazzy, split-screen look (Haskell Wexler's cinematography), simultaneously showing three scenes. It has great caper scenes. It has the dune buggy scene with McQueen and Dunaway. It has ""the longest kiss"" in screen history. (In those prehistoric days, gifted performers were able to put over smoldering love scenes without taking off their clothes!) Not to mention Michel Legrand's score, and the Oscar-winning theme song, ""Windmills of Your Mind,"" that Legrand composed with his frequent collaborators, lyricists Marilyn and Alan Bergman.And it has Norman Jewison's (The Russians are Coming, the Russians are Coming; In The Heat of the Night; Moonstruck; The Hurricane, etc.) very able hands holding it all together. (I wonder if the reviewer who dismissed the original as ""languid,"" ever saw it.)The remake, meanwhile, is dragged down by its nominal star. Watching Brosnan and Russo work together, I feel like I'm watching a wonderful fighter (Russo) in a fixed fight, who literally has to hold up an inferior opponent (Brosnan) for 15 rounds (title bouts used to last that long), before letting him knock him out. I'm not saying Brosnan is a ""tomato can"" (boxing lingo for a human punching bag); he has a couple of moves, especially in the caper scenes, but he is nevertheless a lightweight who doesn't belong in the same ring with Russo.Well, you know what? This version, which was transplanted from Boston to New York, and changed from a bank heist to a museum job, ain't exactly chopped liver, either.Director John McTiernan is a veteran of Bruce Wilis, Arnorld Schwarzenegger, and Tom Clancy flicks. He knows how to pace a summer movie, and is as good as they come at framing an action scene. The pleasant surprise is how well he handles the little things, the scenes where ""nothing is happening."" For McTiernan's soft touch, together with Russo, make this remake a pleasure worth repeated viewings.The story: Bored billionaire Thomas Crown decides to put some spice in his life by stealing a zillion-dollar painting from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Catherine Banning is the world-class insurance investigator whose mission it is to recover the painting. Det. Michael McCann (Denis Leary) is the local boy, an outer-borough, working-class hero, whose job it is to put Crown away. I'm not giving anything away here.The trick is, that Catherine Banning starts falling for Thomas Crown, and has to decide whether he's really fallen for her, too, or if he's just using her to get away with the caper. And then there's Mike McCann's problem. He likes Crown, and eventually, he falls for Banning, too.In one respect, this movie is like Terms of Endearment. If you don't fall in love with, or strongly identify with Debra Winger's ""Emma,"" you won't love Terms. For Russo/Crown to work, you have to fall for, or identify with Russo's ""Catherine Banning."" I fell. Hard.The camera loves Rene Russo. Not that she's beautiful ... anymore, that is. Being beautiful isn't enough to fill the camera, anyway. Very few actresses today can consistently fill the movie screen, and all of them are named Meryl Streep.(TV is different. As much as I love TV, many performers who can fill the small screen are dwarfed by the big one -- think, David Caruso, the original star of NYPD Blue.)In two of Russo's best scenes, the camera tightly frames her beaten countenance, as she says little or nothing. That she wasn't nominated for best actress was an outrage. It is exceedingly rare to see one performer (think: Gene Hackman, Tom Hanks or Denzel Washington) carry a movie the way she does here. I can repeat the rationalizations for overlooking Russo in my sleep: 'It's a summer movie'; 'It' s a caper flick,"" etc.As for Russo's much-heralded nude scene, it is gratuitous, and does her no favors. She's obviously past her prime. I was embarrassed for her, and gladdened recently to hear her announce that she will no longer do any nude scenes.But I haven't exhausted the pleasures of this film. Director John McTiernan has come a long way since Die Hard, and he and his screenwriters, Leslie Dixon and Kurt Wimmer, deliver the goods -- split-second timing, devilish cleverness, and a quirky sense of humor -- that only the best caper flicks provide. And then there's that something extra that elevates it -- the movie within the movie.Released in 1999, this film is set in present-day New York. And yet, the most successful caper of the flick may be the parallel time game it plays. It's set in 1999 AND somewhere around 1964. But don't take my word for it. Look at Denis Leary's suits. They're awfully close to what Paul Burke, then the biggest star in TV, used to wear playing a detective in the first great, New York City-based cop show, The Naked City, from 1960-63.But Leary's Det. McCann is nothing like the gruff character played by the middle-aged, suddenly paunchy Paul Burke in the original Affair. This lanky lawman is no jelly doughnut, yet once you get past the tough facade, he has an outer-borough (non-Manhattan), working-class sweetness, poignance, and yes, gallantry, to him that makes me mourn a city that is no longer. There is no room for this character in the City of 1999. I know; I live there.And if you want to see screen chemistry, watch closely whenever Russo and Leary are alone together. Now, HE's a contender!Faye Dunaway pops up in a cameo role as Crown's psychiatrist. As it is unnecessary to propel the story along, a scriptwriting seminar guru would frown on her appearance, which is but one of the luxuries in a great caper movie that refuses to slavishly follow formulas.",4,The Rene Russo Affair,1051574400,"04 29, 2003",2003,6256,"['so', 'expected', 'be', 'disappointed', 'remake', 'Norman', 'Jewison', 'jazzy', 'quintessentially', '60', 'caper', 'film',

I can say that both are among my favorite films of their generations--the Steve McQueen/Faye Dunaway (also some of my favorite  actors of the period--McQueen in the Great Escape and The Getaway, Dunaway  especially in this film, Bonnie and Clyde and Chinatown) version had had a  great caper film plot, a little romance, the split screen direction had  never been used so well (and hasn't been beaten since), has great  cinematography, a great 60s film score, suspense, the great glider shots,  and my fave scene-the beach buggy ride.  The film was a definite 60s movie  with great stars and the maximum in sex and violence of its time--it's so  great to see how much it's changed thirty years later in the new version,  another great film (that in so many ways outdoes the original).  Rene Russo  outdoes Faye Dunaway big-time (which were big shoes to fill--who could  forget the seductive chess game), and Pierce Brosnan, even though debonair  in his own right, plays James Bond in this movie and not Thomas Crown.  This movie by itself I realize is not that great--there's no way it would  have been up for any real awards or honors, yet it is a greatly-made, well  (not perfectly) crafted filmmaking, much as the original was.  For one, the  scene where Crown steals the painting ranks among my favorite movie scenes  of all time, where everything going on is perfect--another great film  score, sensationalism, the ways the scene was set up, how the fall guys  were getting the museum ready and without anyone even noticing it for Crown  to come in without a peep.  Smooth, slick, in and out.  The way the rest of  the film goes--the great chemistry between Brosnan and Russo, the  conversation they have in the restaurant--and then when the two start  really start showboating for each other--Russo entering his house looking  for the painting, the way she cuts in on the dance floor, the fantastic,  acrobatic sex scenes.  The film's only major flaw is keeping it unfaithful  in the end compared to the original.  It would have been nice to see a  romance film that ended differently from every other film of it's genre.  It's TOO 90s to have this particular finale, but that is what makes it such  a great 90s film because it is faithful to the culture.  John McTiernan's  laid-back audio commentary is interesting, but other than that the film  lacks Special Features other than the two previews (or trailers if you are  into movie jargon) from the '68 and '99 films.",5,One of the Few Remakes Better than the Original,961632000,"06 22, 2000",2000,2557,"['have', 'new', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Affair', 'old', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Affair', 'DVD', 'can', 'say', 'are', 'favorite', 'films', 'generations', 'Steve', 'McQueen/Faye', 'Dunaway', 'also', 'favorite', 'actors', 'period', 'McQueen', 'Great', 'Escape', 'Getaway', 'Dunaway', 'especially', 'film', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'Chinatown', 'version', 'had', 'had', 'great', 'caper', 'film', 'plot', 'little', 'romance', 'split', 'screen', 'direction', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'used', 'so', 'well', ""n't"", 'been', 'beaten', 'great', 'cinematography', 'great', '60s', 'film', 'score', 'suspense', 'great', 'glider', 'shots', 'fave', 'scene-the', 'beach', 'buggy', 'ride', 'film', 'was', 'definite', '60s', 'movie', 'great', 'stars', 'maximum', 'sex', 'violence', 'time', 'so', 'great', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'changed', 'thirty', 'years', 'later', 'new', 'version', 'great', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'outdoes', 'original', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'big-time', 'were', 'big', 'shoes', 'fill', 'who', 'could', 'forget', 'seductive', 'chess', 'game', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'even', 'debonair', 'own', 'right', 'James', 'Bond', 'movie', 'not', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'movie', 'realize', 'not', 'great', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'up', 'real', 'awards', 'honors', 'greatly-made', 'well', 'not', 'perfectly', 'crafted', 'filmmaking', 'much', 'original', 'was', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Crown', 'painting', 'ranks', 'favorite', 'movie', 'scenes', 'time', 'where', 'everything', 'going', 'perfect', 'great', 'film', 'score', 'sensationalism', 'ways', 'scene', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'how', 'fall', 'guys', 'were', 'getting', 'museum', 'ready', 'anyone', 'even', 'noticing', 'Crown', 'come', 'peep', 'Smooth', 'slick', 'way', 'rest', 'film', 'great', 'chemistry', 'Brosnan', 'Russo', 'conversation', 'have', 'restaurant', 'then', 'when', 'two', 'start', 'really', 'start', 'showboating', 'other', 'Russo', 'entering', 'house', 'looking', 'painting', 'way', 'dance', 'floor', 'fantastic', 'acrobatic', 'sex', 'scenes', 'film', 'only', 'major', 'flaw', 'keeping', 'unfaithful', 'end', 'compared', 'original', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'romance', 'film', 'ended', 'differently', 'other', 'film', 'genre', 'TOO', '90s', 'have', 'particular', 'finale', 'what', 'such', 'great', '90s', 'film', 'faithful', 'culture', 'John', 'McTiernan', 'laid-back', 'audio', 'commentary', 'interesting', 'other', 'film', 'Special', 'Features', 'other', 'two', 'previews', 'trailers', 'are', 'movie', 'jargon', ""'68"", 'films']",The Thomas Crown Affair VHS

472276,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6305657939,Reviewer,"[1, 1]","A wealthy businessman with an eye for art meets his match in the clever and romantic, suspenseful, ""The Thomas Crown Affair,"" directed by John McTiernan.  Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) stages an intricately planned  heist of an art museum, and successfully makes off with a Monet worth  millions.  Enter the insurance investigator, the crafty Catherine Banning  (Rene Russo), and the game is on.  While detective Michael McCann (Denis  Leary) follows the bread-crumb trail left for him by Crown, Banning sees  through it immediately, and zeros in on Crown from the beginning.  But how  to nail him?  Therein lies the heart of the story, as Banning goes right to  it.  She tells Crown that she knows he did it; Crown responds by taking her  to dinner, then proceeds to court her, without ever admitting or denying  her allegations.  Then it's head to head, as they each vie for the pole  position, and the sparks begin to fly.  McTiernan shows some style here  as he leads his stars through their interlude of discovery.  He wisely  avoids any showy displays and lets the tightly wound suspense of the story  play out through the charismatic performances of Brosnan and Russo.  Brosnan fits the part of Crown perfectly; there are shades of Bond,  perhaps, and even a bit of ""Remington Steele here,"" but he makes Crown his  own man, a separate entity which he plays with aplomb.  Russo has never  been better, nor looked better, and makes Banning a force to be reckoned  with; there's a worldly sophistication to her, an intelligent confidence  that lets you know there's something always cooking beneath the surface.  The chemistry between the two sizzles, and how refreshing it is to see  romance develop between two mature adults, as opposed to the more prevalent  screen pairings Hollywood usually has to offer (Connery and Zeta-Jones in  ""Entrapment,"" for example); it lends credibility to the story and makes the  proceedings all that more interesting.  There's some memorable scenes here,  especially the initial caper, when Crown purloins the Monet, and later on,  the ""bowler-hat"" sequence that takes place in the museum.  In something of  an homage to the original 1968 ""Crown,"" Banning is taken aloft by Crown in  his glider, which proves to be visually stunning, and adds a placid moment  that fits in well with the overall film.  The supporting cast includes  Faye Dunaway (Crown's psychiatrist), Ben Gazzara (Andrew), Frankie Faison  (Detective Paretti), Fritz Weaver (John) and Charles Keating (Friedrich).  McTiernan has fashioned a romantic caper that is satisfying to both the eye  and the mind; and with an imaginative plot and the performances of Brosnan  and Russo, ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" is a success on all fronts.

Her snarky smile and the ""I told you so"" grins are a bit much.She bypasses police protocol and without any real authority piques Crowne's attitude and interest that he is now a suspect in the art heist.  Faye Dunaway in the original (who also plays a cameo as a snarky psychiatrist who laughs at her own patients in this film) was the insurance investigator but was also playing by the rules.  Renee's Ms. Banning is a smart ass and not a very good insurance investigator at that, despite a few lucky guesses.Russo starts to crack as Crowne drags her out -- a few jealous moments, some betrayal -- but heck, she's not that attractive, even with her clothes off!Peter Brosnan plays a financier who plans art heists just because he can, but unlike Steve McQueen in the original, Peter underplays it all.Strange scenes:  she steals his keys and then makes copies.  then she and her boys essentially break into Crowne's house.  since they have no warrant, any evidence would not be admissible, so what's the point?  Crowne out-smarts her and we hear strains of ""Windmills of Your Mind"" which is cute (the theme song from the original) but really now!Russo, when she does break down, is not all that strong after all and that's really too bad.  The ending is a bit happier than the original, however.I will give the movie props for a decent soundtrack and some homage to the original film.

Ms Russo's wardrobe is absolutely stunning and so is she. I think they both did an excellent job of acting in this film. I have both the regular dvd and blu ray...both work fine. This film was reasonably priced and the shipping time was 2 days. Can't go wrong with this one. I gave it five stars because I adore Rene Russo for one, two, the chemistry is excellent, three,  the acting is respectable, and the movie keeps you engaged.

472301,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,6305657939,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[1, 2]","Pierce Brosnan is often better as 007 in non-James Bond films than he is in the real thing-and ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" leads the pack.  In a remake almost as good as the original, Brosnan generally delivers the goods, playing a bored multi-millionaire who pulls off high-stakes art heists for fun.  When he meets up with the savvy insurance investigator (Renee Russo) hot on his trail, romantic sparks fly.  It's all done with slick polish by underrated action director John McTiernan, who deserves to helm a Bond film some day, should the producers want to make Bonds for grownups with taste again.  But as good as the cool and collected Brosnan is, he's no Steve McQueen, having the looks and style but lacking the quiet angst, and, therefore, edgy subtext that propelled the first Thomas Crown.  (Ironically, Brosnan often plays 007 with exactly that kind of angst, which creates discord with the juvenile scripts and cartoonish nature of most contemporary Bond films).  Other weaknesses include an ending that undermines the cynicism of the original and Russo, who is just way too manly to be believable as the brainy sexpot she's supposed to be.  Wow, tastes have changed.  However, the lovely Faye Dunaway, who played the role in the first version, shows up in an all-too-brief cameo here.  Of course, seeing Dennis Leary with what appears to be either a $2 haircut or a dead blonde animal on his head might be worth the admission, and the climax of the film, like the earlier caper, is a hoot.  All in all, this version of ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" is meant to be a surefire crowd-pleaser, calculated, in much the same way as the first few Bonds, to make women swoon and men walk out of the theater a little taller.  In that respect, it succeeds ably and stands up to repeat viewings.  (I'd prefer to give it four and half stars, but I'll go with five.)",5,"Great Date Flick, But Not as Good as the Original",1118534400,"06 12, 2005",2005,1862,"['Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'often', 'better', '007', 'non-James', 'Bond', 'films', 'real', 'thing-and', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Affair', 'pack', 'remake', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'Brosnan', 'generally', 'goods', 'playing', 'bored', 'multi-millionaire', 'who', 'high-stakes', 'art', 'heists', 'fun', 'When', 'up', 'savvy', 'insurance', 'investigator', 'Renee', 'Russo', 'hot', 'trail', 'romantic', 'sparks', 'fly', 'done', 'slick', 'polish', 'underrated', 'action', 'director', 'John', 'McTiernan', 'who', 'helm', 'Bond', 'film', 'day', 'should', 'producers', 'want', 'make', 'Bonds', 'grownups', 'taste', 'again', 'as', 'good', 'cool', 'collected', 'Brosnan', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'having', 'looks', 'style', 'lacking', 'quiet', 'angst', 'therefore', 'edgy', 'subtext', 'propelled', 'first', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Ironically', 'Brosnan', 'often', '007', 'exactly', 'kind', 'angst', 'discord', 'juvenile', 'scripts', 'cartoonish', 'nature', 'most', 'contemporary', 'Bond', 'films', 'Other', 'weaknesses', 'include', 'ending', 'cynicism', 'original', 'Russo', 'who', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'manly', 'be', 'believable', 'brainy', 'sexpot', 'supposed', 'be', 'Wow', 'tastes', 'have', 'changed', 'However', 'lovely', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'who', 'played', 'role', 'first', 'version', 'up', 'all-too-brief', 'cameo', 'here', 'course', 'seeing', 'Dennis', 'Leary', 'what', 'be', 'either', '2', 'haircut', 'dead', 'blonde', 'animal', 'head', 'might', 'be', 'admission', 'climax', 'film', 'earlier', 'caper', 'hoot', 'version', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Affair', 'meant', 'be', 'surefire', 'crowd-pleaser', 'calculated', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'first', 'few', 'Bonds', 'make', 'women', 'swoon', 'men', 'walk', 'theater', 'little', 'taller', 'respect', 'ably', 'up', 'repeat', 'viewings', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'give', 'four', 'half', 'stars', ""'ll"", 'go', 'five']",The Thomas Crown Affair VHS

Unlike in the original movie (that was a bank heist), Crown actually participates in the theft.Enter insurance investigator Catherine Banning (Rene Russo) with police detective Michael McCann (Denis Leary).  Banning identifies Crown as the mastermind behind this crime.  She's out to get him but a problem ensues along the way: she falls for Crown and Crown falls for her.  Their scenes together are sizzling and explosive.Unlike the 1968 original, there is tension created as the viewer wonders if Crown will actually get caught.  As well, the sexual tension between Crown and the insurance investigator is heightened in this movie.The acting is terrific by Brosnan, Russo, and Leary.  I have to give special kudos to Russo as the smart and very sexy insurance investigator Catherine Banning.  The background music is interesting and adds to each scene.  There is a clever ending that I found unforgettable and fun to watch.  I felt the entire movie was slick and ingeniously done.Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2000) is perfect in visual and audio quality.  It has the movie on both sides of the disc (where the movie is in wide screen on one side and full screen on the other).

This is just a review of the quality of the Blu Ray transfer.I do have the standard definition version which I have not watched in some time so it is really not a comparison review.  The video transfer is good with no artifacting or aliasing anywhere and only the slightest hint of grain which, for the most part ,is undetectable.  However, the transfer to blu ray appears as if the producers crushed the blacks a touch too much creating deep blacks but with not a whole lot of detail in the shadows.  Colors are deep and resolution is good with a fairly warm color grading but there are parts where it just appears to be darkened or shaded.The DTSHD 5.1 audio is really quite excellent with fine use of the entire system and discreet channeling of foley fx as well as panning around the audio system.  Not a whole lot here for the LFE channel to use but the audio editing shines in several places.  The soundtrack is beautifully spread across the front stage with individual instrumentation nicely separated across the stage.There were no extras of any kind on this disc.For me, the bottom line is that the audio transfer is the star of the Blu Ray while the video, while good, appears muted.  I do think, however, that the switch from SD to BR, if the price is good, makes a purchase worthy.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",4,Thomas Crown Affair on Blu Ray,1354406400,"12 2, 2012",2012,1862,"['getting', 'harder', 'harder', 'find', 'reviews', 'actually', 'quality', 'transfer', 'movie', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'rather', 'reading', 'just', 'summary', 'plot', 'opinions', 'acting', 'film', 'was', 'exciting', 'not', 'just', 'review', 'quality', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'transfer.I', 'do', 'have', 'standard', 'definition', 'version', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'time', 'really', 'not', 'comparison', 'review', 'video', 'transfer', 'good', 'artifacting', 'aliasing', 'anywhere', 'only', 'slightest', 'hint', 'grain', 'most', 'part', 'undetectable', 'However', 'transfer', 'blu', 'ray', 'producers', 'crushed', 'blacks', 'touch', 'too', 'much', 'creating', 'deep', 'blacks', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'detail', 'shadows', 'Colors', 'are', 'deep', 'resolution', 'good', 'fairly', 'warm', 'color', 'grading', 'are', 'parts', 'where', 'just', 'be', 'darkened', 'shaded.The', 'DTSHD', '5.1', 'audio', 'really', 'quite', 'excellent', 'fine', 'use', 'entire', 'system', 'discreet', 'channeling', 'foley', 'fx', 'as', 'well', 'panning', 'audio', 'system', 'Not', 'whole', 'lot', 'here', 'LFE', 'channel', 'use', 'audio', 'editing', 'shines', 'several', 'places', 'soundtrack', 'beautifully', 'spread', 'front', 'stage', 'individual', 'instrumentation', 'nicely', 'separated', 'stage.There', 'were', 'extras', 'kind', 'disc.For', 'bottom', 'line', 'audio', 'transfer', 'star', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'video', 'good', 'muted', 'do', 'think', 'however', 'switch', 'SD', 'BR', 'price', 'good', 'purchase', 'worthy.All', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'BluRay', 'so', 'check', 'see', 'are', 'help', 'well.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",The Thomas Crown Affair VHS

John McTiernan, usually  known for high-octane action films such as ""Predator"" and ""Die Hard,"" crafts a wonderful tale of romance surrounding an art gallery thief and the insurance specialist sent to retrieve his 'booty' (please pardon the horrible pun!). The two leads, Rene Russo (who just owns the entire movie) and Pierce Brosnan are magnetic and wonderfully likeable characters. Its refreshing to see two leads who are the same age as one another, as opposed to a liason between an older man and a woman half his age. This gives the film even more credibility and makes it more fun to watch. The movie also boasts a wonderfully original and jazzy score by McTiernan partner Bill Conti; and who better to sing the fantastic version of ""Windmills Of Your Mind"" than the great Sting. As noted in the Amazon.com review, the film is more a cat and smarter cat movie than the cliched cat and mouse flick. Russo and Brosnan try to outthink and outsmart one another at each turn, often with clever results. The film is highly enjoyable and is sure to be one that you will enter into the 'repeat viewing' category. It certainly doesn't hurt that Rene Russo just oozes sexuality out of every pore of her body - I never realized how gorgeous she was until I saw this film! Great film for date night, or for watching with that special someone.

Done with style, class, and lots of soft focus  and a excellent music score (the intro piano work just fits so well with  the mood of this film), CROWN delights, thrills and entertains all at the  same time.  It wears it heart on it's sleeve and holds it's wallet in it's  hand... because this movie is also about money.  People who have money,  spend money, make money, and throw away money... all in the name of the  ultimate corporate merger... it's funny.  It's well directed and solid  performacnes abound all around.  Worth picking up (as well as the  original).  As for the DVD, it does not pack a lot of extra's.  The  interface is set inside the museum viewing room where the pictures on the  wall are stills and scenes from the film (nice - well done).  It contains  two previews (the remake and the original), as well as director John  McTiernan's narration on the making of this movie... which I have to say is  a major disappointment.

Getting  to a particular scene in this film is also getting to a particularly clever  orchestration.  Still, this is no novel feature; it's just barely meeting  the definition of &quot;DVD&quot;.  To be sure, there is an insightful  director's commentary, but in the wake of _The Sixth Sense_ and other  feature rich DVDs, the bar has been raised higher than this DVD can  match.Luckily, the film itself is largely satisfying, clever, and  suspenseful--even if you've seen the original with Steve McQueen.  It is  somewhat true that repeat viewings allow you to unravel the suspense of the  plot in mildly unsatisfying ways--but not on the first repeat.  Even so,  I'm not sure I come to this movie with such hyper-critical goggles.  The  fact that the events herein are explained well by the plot, even if they  might not be possible to achieve in real life, is enough to assuage the  critic in me.  Also, even though others have seen it as gratuitous, I  liked the nod given to that original production by having Faye Dunnaway  appear here as the psychologist.  A small role, yes, but it did allow for  some interesting storytelling technique, allowing us into the psyche of  Thomas Crown in a way usually reserved to novels.All in all, then,  this is a thoroughly enjoyable production, perfect for a first date.  It's  smart, it's sexy, it's got fantastic music and, above all, style.

472326,A1YQS7S1IE53SB,6305657939,Wendy C. Rigney,"[3, 4]","The above succinctly could summarize the slick cat and mouse game that ensues between Catherine Banning and Thomas Crown in a stylishly, visually stunning remake of &lt;i>The Thomas Crown Affair&lt;/i>.  For those looking for a couple hours of pure escapism and enjoyment for adults over 30, this is it.As has already been said in many reviews, Pierce Brosnan assumes the role Steve McQueen made famous in 1968.  It is quickly established that Crown is wealthy, handsome, powerful...and bored.  So, with his sharp intellect, he sets about stealing a priceless painting -- just so he can feel the rush.  Pierce Brosnan plays Crown as very dashing and low key...and it works here, especially because of the game.  For him to show too much would be to tip his hand, so Crown keeps his pursuer, Catherine, on her toes as she both tries to pin the crime on him -- and avoid falling under a spell that she finds appealing in spite of herself which, in the end, makes it all the more fascinating to see her try to trip &lt;i>him&lt;/i> up at various turns.  As many others have noted, it is less cat and mouse than smart and smarter cat, and it is fascinating to watch them tangle -- physically, intellectually, and emotionally -- as the stakes seem to intensify in terms of job vs. romance.Rene Russo is wonderful as Catherine Banning.  While Faye Dunaway's Vicky Anderson was considered strong for her time in the 1968 version, she still seemed too ""mushy"" in the end, too ""heart on her sleeve"".  Catherine in the 1999 version, though, picked up where Vicky left off and yes, heresy to purists, I'm sure, improved on Vicky's strengths and toned down the other stuff.  Catherine is strong, worldly, fiesty, and has a take no prisoners attitude that is &lt;i>occasionally&lt;/i> (and subtley) allowed to be offset by vulnerability and softness.  Overall, however, Catherine is, as Faye Dunaway's [Vicky in 1968's ""TCA""] therapist character notes in the film, a mirror image of Thomas.  And this allows for the complication of Catherine being drawn into Thomas, first as a suspect but ultimately as someone she is fascinated by and could all too easily love.I will not give away the ending...but I never knew the use of a simple bowler hat could be so clever, and use a painting with one as a nice inside joke.  John McTiernan was a man who knew how to use cinematography to his film's advantage, and it shows.  It is colorful, sharp, and slick...the perfect counterpart to the leads.Still, before I end this, I must give major props to Denis Leary.  Before viewing this, all I knew him as was an acidic, tart comic with an edge.  But as Detective Michael McCann, he goes toe to toe with Russo and succeeds brilliantly.  McCann is also a jaded man, a New York City cop, but he also has a sense of intelligence just as the leads do, and he is genuinely likeable and downright droll.  You can't help but root for him in spite of his target...and the fact that he seems to also have a tiny crush on Catherine makes this game even more ""twisty"", and the end result is somewhat bittersweet.Thankfully, this movie's romance is with two adults of the same generation and not some 40ish-year-old man going after a 20-something babe in tight clothes.  The fact that it is sexy, slzzling, and even tender proves that chemistry does not have to die once your 30s are through!  Russo and Brosnan sparkled!I highly recommend buying the DVD.  This is a film you'll want to view more than once.",5,"""Think you'll get me?"", ""Oh, I hope so.""",1074729600,"01 22, 2004",2004,3471,"['above', 'succinctly', 'could', 'summarize', 'slick', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'Catherine', 'Banning', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'stylishly', 'visually', 'stunning', 'remake', 'lt', '>', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Affair', 'lt', '>', 'looking', 'couple', 'hours', 'pure', 'escapism', 'enjoyment', 'adults', '30', 'it.As', 'already', 'been', 'said', 'many', 'reviews', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'role', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'made', 'famous', '1968', 'quickly', 'established', 'Crown', 'wealthy', 'handsome', 'powerful', 'bored', 'So', 'sharp', 'intellect', 'stealing', 'priceless', 'painting', 'just', 'can', 'feel', 'rush', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Crown', 'very', 'dashing', 'low', 'key', 'here', 'especially', 'game', 'show', 'too', 'much', 'would', 'be', 'tip', 'hand', 'so', 'Crown', 'keeps', 'pursuer', 'Catherine', 'toes', 'tries', 'pin', 'crime', 'avoid', 'falling', 'spell', 'appealing', 'spite', 'herself', 'end', 'more', 'fascinating', 'see', 'try', 'trip', 'lt', '>', 'lt', '>', 'up', 'various', 'turns', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'less', 'cat', 'mouse', 'smart', 'smarter', 'cat', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'tangle', 'physically', 'intellectually', 'emotionally', 'stakes', 'seem', 'intensify', 'terms', 'job', 'vs.', 'romance.Rene', 'Russo', 'wonderful', 'Catherine', 'Banning', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'Vicky', 'Anderson', 'was', 'considered', 'strong', 'time', '1968', 'version', 'still', 'seemed', 'too', 'mushy', 'end', 'too', 'heart', 'sleeve', 'Catherine', '1999', 'version', 'though', 'picked', 'up', 'where', 'Vicky', 'left', 'off', 'yes', 'heresy', 'purists', ""'m"", 'sure', 'improved', 'Vicky', 'strengths', 'toned', 'down', 'other', 'stuff', 'Catherine', 'strong', 'worldly', 'fiesty', 'take', 'prisoners', 'attitude', 'lt', 'i', '>', 'occasionally', 'lt', '>', 'subtley', 'allowed', 'be', 'offset', 'vulnerability', 'softness', 'Overall', 'however', 'Catherine', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', '[', 'Vicky', '1968', 'TCA', ']', 'therapist', 'character', 'notes', 'film', 'mirror', 'image', 'Thomas', 'complication', 'Catherine', 'being', 'drawn', 'Thomas', 'first', 'suspect', 'ultimately', 'someone', 'fascinated', 'could', 'all', 'too', 'easily', 'love.I', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'never', 'knew', 'use', 'simple', 'bowler', 'hat', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'clever', 'use', 'painting', 'one', 'nice', 'inside', 'joke', 'John', 'McTiernan', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'knew', 'how', 'use', 'cinematography', 'film', 'advantage', 'colorful', 'sharp', 'slick', 'perfect', 'counterpart', 'leads.Still', 'end', 'must', 'give', 'major', 'props', 'Denis', 'Leary', 'viewing', 'knew', 'was', 'acidic', 'tart', 'comic', 'edge', 'Detective', 'Michael', 'McCann', 'toe', 'toe', 'Russo', 'brilliantly', 'McCann', 'also', 'jaded', 'man', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'cop', 'also', 'sense', 'intelligence', 'just', 'leads', 'do', 'genuinely', 'likeable', 'downright', 'droll', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'root', 'spite', 'target', 'fact', 'also', 'have', 'tiny', 'crush', 'Catherine', 'game', 'even', 'more', 'twisty', 'end', 'result', 'somewhat', 'bittersweet.Thankfully', 'movie', 'romance', 'two', 'adults', 'same', 'generation', 'not', '40ish-year-old', 'man', 'going', '20-something', 'babe', 'tight', 'clothes', 'fact', 'sexy', 'slzzling', 'even', 'tender', 'proves', 'chemistry', 'not', 'have', 'die', 'once', '30s', 'are', 'Russo', 'Brosnan', 'sparkled', 'highly', 'recommend', 'buying', 'DVD', 'film', ""'ll"", 'want', 'view', 'more', 'once']",The Thomas Crown Affair VHS

472334,ALSPQLL2YMF4,6305657939,Woody,"[1, 5]","&quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; is a worthy remake to the film starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway.Just so it's clear, Pierce Brosnan can't touch McQueen in any aspect, but the movie is worthy and  sometimes superior in other areas.  The movie is directed by one of my  favorites(John McTiernan) who directs a pretty entertaining movie and  manages to get good performances from his cast.Yes, this does include  Pierce Brosnan, who actually shows hints of personality, sense of humor and  looks interested in this film.  Rene Russo, however, is simply terrific.  She looks fabulous in this film(better than in Buddy) and conveys more  sexiness in her left leg than most whiny young actresses can come up with  in an hour drama.  Her permance is also very solid, and while watching her  spar with Brosnan, you have to believe that if the two characters were  trying to outdo each other in real life, Rene Russo would simply dominate  that match.  Denis Leary does what he can(although it's good work) with the  nothing role of the cop, who's not allowed to solve the case.The movie  manages to be a quite entertaining adventure without a single shot being  fired, as McTiernan sets up clever heist scenes.  Some scenes do run too  long, and others shouldn't be in the movie in the first place(we know he's  rich I don't have to see him take her for a ride on his plane)Although  the ending is weak(that's happening to often nowadays) &quot;The Thomas  Crown Affair&quot; is an overall entertaining movie.

It might not be the most convincing story, but it does not have to be given the delicious twists and stylish direction.Brosnan might not be more handsome than Alec Baldwin, but with his knowing smiles and cunning eyes, he fits his part as Thomas Crown perfectly. And Rene Russo? What more can I say? I cannot agree more with the previous reviewers: beautiful, confident, sexy, emotional and everything.The photography and score are excellent.
