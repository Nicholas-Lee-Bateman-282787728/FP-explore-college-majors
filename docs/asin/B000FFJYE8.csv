988981,AHNYRCBNPYS9P,B000FFJYE8,AeroEngineer,"[0, 3]","I liked Weeds S1 it was interesting and kind of a novel idea, however overall I thought the acting was very wooden and contrived and some of the storylines were very unrealistic. This show seems like ""Just Shoot Me"" mixed with ""The OC"" with some drugs mixed in. I mean come on, no drug dealer is going to just have sex with a rival and back off, this is where the  unreality becomes a little much, although the comedic nature of this series would explain this there wasn't much funny there. Overall the superficiality of this series is it's strength, otherwise we have another depressing journal of the death and destruction that is the real world of drugs that has touched everyone either directly or indirectly.The best character is the drug dealing auntie who supplies the main character with her goods. I find the kids to be an uninteresting side story that are necessary to complete the setting only. The main character seems the least interesting to me, bumbling through it all with a blah attitude while things happen to her. The accountant is the most hilarious character coupled with the slacker brother in law, their adventures are the real comedy here. The chronicles of so called grown ups who are still teenagers is great.This series is an above average one only because it's one of the premium channel series that can show anything it wants with no advertiser limitations. It's not particularly deep but is satisfying in its cliched ""California"" quirkiness and decadence that we all love to revel in.

988982,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000FFJYE8,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[9, 32]","I feel that sometimes suburbia gets a bad rapport.  Why wouldn't any American mind living in a safe neighborhood, with genuinely friendly people of middle-upper class representation, and sending their children to well endowed schools?  At times I believe we, as a nation, mock what we already have to somehow make it seem like a bigger issue than it already is.  Sure, it is easy to poke fun at identical houses, to soccer moms that drive SUVs, and the ability to believe that no evil occurs in these small pieces of the ""American Dream"", but in reality, don't we all wish we lived in some form of suburbia?  That is maybe a different discussion for a different day.  I recently had the opportunity to see what the television network Showtime felt about suburbia and their answers to the Soprano's (isn't every station trying to get a piece of this pie) popularity in the increasingly popular show Weeds.Fried Green Tomatoes star Mary-Louise Parker headlines this show as a recent suburbia widow who has found the dutiful job of dealing to cover expenses and raise cash for her increasingly annoying family.  Without any indication of how she found this profession, we are submerged headfirst into her choppy life of dealing, mothering, and coping with her newfound popularity.  Through the course of the season she transforms her small town dealings to a true business with the groundlings of becoming a new Godfather of suburbia.  She runs into issues with local dealers, with her supplier, and even her neighbors as Nancy Botwin slowly develops from small housewife to an eventual big leaguer.So, why didn't this series immediately make me smile?To begin, I loved the opening song by Malvina Reynolds!  Her raspy voice introduced me to this series with eager eyes and ears.  I loved her song about suburbia, yet was somewhat confused.  Was this to be a series about suburbia or about dealing in the suburbs?  What I eventually discovered was that it played upon the already overplayed clich&eacute;s about suburbia, while giving Parker the opportunity to live in a big house, drive a nice car, and co-exist in a pre-planned community while she sold drugs to those living around her.  Creator Jenji Kohan interestingly creates a counterpoint with Elizabeth Perkins, a great friend of Parker, who knows nothing of what is happening under her nose.  Perkins represents what we are to think those in suburbia believe, that nothing bad is happening in their own backyard.  I liked this juxtaposition, but what became increasingly annoying to me was the surrounding stories of our characters, and sometimes, the ""lack of"" stories that gave us nothing but tattered edges and jagged characters.  To begin, Kohan needed to give us the story of how Parker got into her newly discovered world of drug dealing.  While he will probably explore that further in other seasons, this would have been the one to do it.  I needed to see a good transition from suburban housewife to dealer, but instead all I got was an immediate dealer who apparently had built enough trust with her supplier to be as buddy-buddy as the first episode showed them to be.With that flash beginning, I found myself struggling through the next several episodes.  I knew the characters, but never quite felt like I actually ""knew"" them.  I wanted to know more about Nancy and her husband.  I needed to see a stronger idea of their family life, especially Nancy's relationship with Silas and Shane pre-dealing.  I think this would have set us up for a stronger grasp around the characters.  I also felt that the stories were extremely clich&eacute;.  Showtime had a brilliant premise here, but loaded it down with situations that I could see coming a mile away.  The issues with her children, the move-in of the classic Six Feet Under crazy brother-in-law (played by Justin Kirk), and a very strange relationship with her dealer Conrad/neighbor Doug Wilson.  I think I felt like I was rushed too quickly into this series.  I needed more defined moments.  I needed stronger connections.  Also, how did Nancy, in the course of about five to eight episodes, build up such a big client base?  Did anyone else think that this was just a bit too quick, even for television?  With a stronger character driven stories, more reality on the business of drugs, and less comedy about suburbia, I think Showtime would have had a definite hit on their hands, but with these obvious problems, it just never seemed to congeal well together.I must admit though, the last three episodes of this series did make me a bit eager to watch the next season.  There is an obvious changing point in this first season, and for me it came with Nancy's interaction with the ""penny"" drug dealer.  That episode felt like a sucker punch to the gut.  What happened in that one episode did not seem to fit with the rest of the season.  After that obvious icebreaker, we seemed to head into a world too similar to that of The Sopranos, and I felt that Showtime was just trying to obviously steal viewers.  Maybe I went into this expecting too much, but it boasted itself as groundbreaking, but just like Huff, I felt like Weeds borrowed too much from the surrounding television shows.  Perhaps that it the direction that our programs are headed, maybe not, all I know is that Weeds was decent, just not great.  Parker didn't seem comfortable most of the time in her role, Perkins' big scare near the end felt enormously clich&eacute;, and Nealon's talent just seemed wasted.  The only plus that I have about this show is the music.  It has introduced me to some great new albums.Overall, I don't think I could watch this season again.  I think it will get better with age, but there needs to be a stronger push towards characters in the next season instead of just ""shock"".  Drug dealers in suburbia are no different than New Jersey mob living in extremely ritzy neighborhoods.  I felt a bit cheated watching this season, yet the cliffhanger ending left me wanting to see more.  I have hope for Weeds, but I am not holding my breath.Grade: ** out of *****",2,Little Boxes & Ticky Tacky,1154131200,"07 29, 2006",2006,6080,"['feel', 'sometimes', 'suburbia', 'bad', 'rapport',

988988,A20RQB3SXOQCGF,B000FFJYE8,Birdman,"[2, 2]","I'm not certain WEEDS would fly as high as it has without Mary-Louise Parker. She brings to the role of Nancy a range of expression, humor and pathos one seldom sees on or off cable. Without her, some humor here would fall flat because she's so often the ""straight man,"" deflecting and reflecting the insanity around her. She may be the dealer here, but she remains the most ethical character in the script.Some reviewers have characterized WEEDS as soap, and others as black comedy. I view it an accurate portrayal of sick demographic slice of culture -- our affluent suburbs. Parts of its decadent charaters and situations are totally hysterical, but others -- involving the struggles of childen coming of age in this mess -- are painful.One of the most poignant moments of the first series occurs at the end of Episode Six in which Nancy watches a video of sexual joy with her deceased Jonah. With her eyes and face she says ten thousand things about loss and abandonment. Few could evoke what she does so well here.The script is literate and clever, and many of the supporting roles -- in particular those of Elizabeth Perkins and Justin Kirk -- are very well done, but their parts are written as caricatures compared to Nancy.In WEEDS, all the separate pieces don't always hang together, nor are all the artfully contrived final scenes of episodes always artful. The audience rarely has any respite between Nancy's catastrophes, and the expletives in the script -- funny as they are -- sometimes become tiresome.The full-screen transfer might have easily been produced in its original wide-screen splendor, but the transfer is still beautiful and true. The musical score is perfect and add much to the action.  The camera-work is fine in its study of faces, the complexities of body language and more.At this price, these ten episodes are a steal, if only to showcase another expert performance by one of our most verstile actresses.  Mysterious and alluring one moment and clumsy or vulnerable the next, her range is amazing.Buy it without regret, but keep younger children out of the livingroom when you watch it.

And the drug, as the title intends, is marijuana, often considered shameful by some to be considered ""illegal"" while others throw tantrums about its gateway significance. But Nancy has to feed her family and she'll do whatever it takes to ensure their survival.In the midst of this seemingly benign town we have a troop of old and new pot smokers. The older generation is exhibited by none other than Kevin Nealon (ANGER MANAGEMENT) whose character, Doug Wilson, is a bored and immature accountant. Self-centered and completely useless in terms of assisting his neighbors, his character is absolutely fantastic. You could easily picture him still in high school if it weren't for his extremely receding hairline and the family minivan he drives. The newer generation is brought to light by Nancy Botwin's brother-in-law, Andy, played by the excellent Justin Kirk (FLANNEL PAJAMAS, 2006). He has no direction in life and is now firmly entrenched in Nancy's home. His failings at life are mirrored through his careless attitudes toward women or growing in any meaningful way. But once in a while -- just occasionally -- he'll make a remark of wonderful profoundness that blows Nancy away. He also is a much needed father-figure (although a VERY screwed up one) for Nancy's two boys, Shane (Alexander Gould, FINDING NEMO) and Silas (Hunter Parrish, RV). It is Silas, the high schooler, whom we get to see experiment with the emerging drug culture that surrounds his household. Although initially unaware of his mother's ""business"", he quickly reveals to the viewer that he's ""not stupid"" about what's happening under his own roof.Nancy's friends are a mixed bag. Celia (Elizabeth Perkins, BIG), is a member of the PTA, has a child who suffers with being overweight, and recently found out her husband had an affair with the local, and beautiful, Asian tennis instructor. As the series progresses, we learn that Celia has breast cancer and this comes as devastating news for someone so infatuated with one's appearance (as seen through the mother-daughter relationships). The Shepard's, a black family that live in a ""bad part of town"", act as Nancy's suppliers of the green leaf. They battle finances versus keeping their business strictly business whenever Nancy comes around (which fluctuates as her business expands and contracts).The wonderful thing about this series is that it puts a mess of moral material in the viewer's lap. What is wrong with marijuana when Percocet and other heavy narcotics are readily available via a doctor's prescription? Is it wrong for a person to support their family by dealing in something as shady as drug trafficking? Can a woman be both a loving and compassionate mother while at the same time selling something potentially addicting? Is it hypocritical for someone to sell ""the stuff"" while at the same time punishing their kids when they catch them doing some of it? Quite a moral quagmire, I'd say.The other thing that makes this series work is it's sexy. Mary-Louise Parker has that ...something about her that makes her both a respectable looking woman and just a tad slutty. She's a sexual being who struggles with life in the shadow of her husband's death and has to decide what's best for her, her kids, and her husband's memory; most times these things are in direct opposition of each other. Elizabeth Perkins mirrors much of Parker's character in that she too has that respectable/slutty look but also some uppityness ...until her cancer rears up. Then she becomes more introspective and the slut takes over, for a while.The series producers also put in a deaf and sexually promiscuous girlfriend for Nancy's son, Silas. This added an entirely new dimension to Silas' character as he's forced to grow-up without a father to guide him through this teenage sexual minefield and he finds solace with the deaf girl's household more than with his own whenever internal family problems arise.This first season took about two episodes to get rolling, but once it did there was no stopping it. You really need to open your mind to the possibilities surrounding this show. It's not JUST about drugs. It's about the people that are shoved into this niche group for the sake of survival, and it's captivating to watch how their flawed lives intermingle. Pot smoker or not, these characters are headed for interesting days. Season two has already been purchased by SHOWTIME, which would indicate WEED might be picking up speed and continue smokin' for some time.",4,"No Stems, No Seeds",1153872000,"07 26,

988990,AYQP8XMHTG2YR,B000FFJYE8,Brandon J. Smith,"[6, 6]","My initial reaction to Weeds was that it stunk. Quite frankly, the pilot episode isn't good. The characters spoke unnaturally, the scenes dragged on,  and it was utterly charmless. Overall, it felt like everyone was trying too hard to be super edgy and shocking. On the advice of a friend, though, I gave the show another chance, and I had to admit that the second episode had me a little curious to see what would happen next. By the third episode, I was hooked.It's difficult to characterize this show, in that its episodes are a half-hour each, but there's as much, if not more, drama than ""comedy"" here - though in the post-Sopranos world, the distinction has become blurred, which is great for a show like this. There are definitely some big laughs along the way, but once the show settles in and finds its rhythm, Weeds  starts building real conflicts and character-driven stories, whether they have comedic aspects or not. And the main story arcs have some really strong momentum: it's not often that the final scene of a ""sitcom"" gets you rushing out to see the next season.To me, Weeds is at its best when Mary Louise-Parker is taught the various ways in which her industry works: the business model, the economics, the dangers, etc. It's important that a show based mainly on one central character has an actress that can pull off the ranges of emotion required, and I think Parker does this well.Like all Showtime shows that I've seen (except It's Garry Shandling's Show - thank goodness), Weeds indulges in too much graphic sex, though it's not on the level of something like The Tudors. Sometimes it works for the plot; sometimes it's just gratuitous.Reflecting back, my only wish for this season was that it had had the pilot it deserved, but of course it's better to start poorly and then get better than to start off well and get worse. So kudos to Weeds for a strong first season. I think anyone who's enjoyed other uncompromising cable-based shows will find a lot to enjoy here.",4,Won me over,1213056000,"06 10, 2008",2008,1996,"['initial', 'reaction', 'Weeds', 'was', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'pilot', 'episode', ""n't"", 'good', 'characters', 'spoke', 'unnaturally', 'scenes', 'dragged', 'was', 'utterly', 'charmless', 'Overall', 'felt', 'everyone', 'was', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'super', 'edgy', 'shocking', 'advice', 'friend', 'gave', 'show', 'chance', 'had', 'admit', 'second', 'episode', 'had', 'little', 'curious', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next', 'third', 'episode', 'was', 'hooked.It', 'difficult', 'characterize', 'show', 'episodes', 'are', 'half-hour', 'as', 'much', 'not', 'more', 'drama', 'comedy', 'here', 'post-Sopranos', 'world', 'distinction', 'become', 'blurred', 'great', 'show', 'are', 'definitely', 'big', 'laughs', 'way', 'once', 'show', 'rhythm', 'Weeds', 'building', 'real', 'conflicts', 'character-driven', 'stories', 'have', 'comedic', 'aspects', 'not', 'main', 'story', 'arcs', 'have', 'really', 'strong', 'momentum', 'not', 'often', 'final', 'scene', 'sitcom', 'rushing', 'out', 'see', 'next', 'season.To', 'Weeds', 'best', 'when', 'Mary', 'Louise-Parker', 'taught', 'various', 'ways', 'industry', 'business', 'model', 'economics', 'dangers', 'etc', 'important', 'show', 'based', 'mainly', 'one', 'central', 'character', 'actress', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'ranges', 'emotion', 'required', 'think', 'Parker', 'Showtime', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Garry', 'Shandling', 'Show', 'thank', 'goodness', 'Weeds', 'too', 'much', 'graphic', 'sex', 'not', 'level', 'something', 'Tudors', 'Sometimes', 'plot', 'just', 'gratuitous.Reflecting', 'back', 'only', 'wish', 'season', 'was', 'had', 'had', 'pilot', 'deserved', 'course', 'better', 'start', 'poorly', 'then', 'get', 'better', 'start', 'off', 'well', 'get', 'worse', 'So', 'kudos', 'Weeds', 'strong', 'first', 'season', 'think', 'anyone', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'other', 'uncompromising', 'cable-based', 'shows', 'will', 'find', 'lot', 'enjoy', 'here']",Weeds: Season 1

988994,ACVBZF3GK3O45,B000FFJYE8,C. Davis,"[3, 3]","Background: I watched this series because I heard that the producer of ""Orange is the New Black"" was also the producer, or at least one of the producers, of this series. I found this black comedy to be very entertaining. The producers explore many of the same topics, modern day tribalism - black, white, Jewish, Hispanic; what is the nature of right and wrong; and what is the line between selfish and unselfish behavior.More background: I have never used marijuana or any other illegal drug. Except for some Tylenol III and beta blockers, I don't think I've used that many prescription drugs either. While the libertarian in me would like to see more drugs legalized, the conservative in me sees this as a change in policy that might have unintended and negative consequences. So I don't have strong feelings on the topic other then the fact that marijuana is currently illegal and therefore I have no intention of trying it anytime soon.The Pros:The characters that are heavy users of pot are the ones that don't seem to have much going on in their lives.  Some of the characters ""evolve"" and change for either the better or worse, but the ones that seem to come out better are the ones that either stop using pot or cut it back to level where it is purely recreational vice at an addictive destroy your live level.While the last episode turns the series into a true comedy - in the Shakespearean sense, where all the characters have a happy ending, this black comedy shows how Nancy's fixation on selling Marijuana to supplement her income after her husband dies is largely counterproductive and leads to one crises after another.The effect on her children is especially telling, one child becomes a psychopath (and a police officer). The other becomes a marijuana farmer. Nancy's middle class dreams of college and white collar work never materialize for her children.In many ways, this series is anti-drug as Reefer Madness. Just in a backwards, subtle, and sarcastic way.The Cons: While I am a softy and only want good things for real people in the real world, in a fictional tale it might have been better for Nancy to suffer more for her crimes and her selfishness.Like many shows about drug use, this series paints what I believe to be an unrealistic picture of illicit drug use in America. Some recent polls say that approximately 100 million Americans have tried pot at least once. If true, that is still less then a third. Shows like Weeds make it seem like pot is everywhere and anyone who doesn't admit it is a hypocrite.I found some of the, ahem, adult scenes to be a bit offensive. I know this was made for Showtime, but still... If it isn't necessary for the plot or to create an artistic point, we don't need very much information and even fewer images.Overall, this is a fun show to watch. If you can put your judgment on hold, it is kind of fun to see what predicament Nancy will get into and how she will get out of it. However, I would not let anyone younger than 17 (or maybe even 18) watch this, the adult scenes and drug use could be misinterpreted by a younger viewer.",4,"NOT FOR CHILDREN, MAYBE NOT FOR SOME ADULTS",1377475200,"08 26, 2013",2013,3095,"['watched', 'series', 'heard', 'producer', 'Orange', 'New', 'Black', 'was', 'also', 'producer', 'least', 'one', 'producers', 'series', 'found', 'black', 'comedy', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'producers', 'explore', 'many', 'same', 'topics', 'modern', 'day', 'tribalism', 'black', 'white', 'Jewish', 'Hispanic', 'what', 'nature', 'right', 'wrong', 'what', 'line', 'selfish', 'unselfish', 'behavior.More', 'background', 'have', 'never', 'used', 'marijuana', 'other', 'illegal', 'drug', 'Tylenol', 'III', 'beta', 'blockers', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'used', 'many', 'prescription', 'drugs', 'libertarian', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'more', 'drugs', 'legalized', 'conservative', 'change', 'policy', 'might', 'have', 'unintended', 'negative', 'consequences', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'strong', 'feelings', 'topic', 'other', 'then', 'fact', 'marijuana', 'currently', 'illegal', 'therefore', 'have', 'intention', 'trying', 'anytime', 'soon.The', 'Pros', 'characters', 'are', 'heavy', 'users', 'pot', 'are', 'ones', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'much', 'going', 'lives', 'characters', 'evolve', 'change', 'better', 'worse', 'ones', 'seem', 'come', 'out', 'better', 'are', 'ones', 'stop', 'using', 'pot', 'cut', 'back', 'level', 'where', 'purely', 'recreational', 'vice', 'addictive', 'destroy', 'live', 'level.While', 'last', 'episode', 'series', 'true', 'comedy', 'Shakespearean', 'sense', 'where', 'characters', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'black', 'comedy', 'how', 'Nancy', 'fixation', 'selling', 'Marijuana', 'supplement', 'income', 'husband', 'largely', 'counterproductive', 'one', 'crises', 'another.The', 'effect', 'children', 'especially', 'telling', 'one', 'child', 'psychopath', 'police', 'officer', 'other', 'marijuana', 'farmer', 'Nancy', 'middle', 'class', 'dreams', 'college', 'white', 'collar', 'work', 'never', 'materialize', 'children.In', 'many', 'ways', 'series', 'anti-drug', 'Reefer', 'Madness', 'Just', 'backwards', 'subtle', 'sarcastic', 'way.The', 'Cons', 'am', 'softy', 'only', 'want', 'good', 'things', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'world', 'fictional', 'tale', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Nancy', 'suffer', 'more', 'crimes', 'selfishness.Like', 'many', 'shows', 'drug', 'use', 'series', 'what', 'believe', 'be', 'unrealistic', 'picture', 'illicit', 'drug', 'use', 'America', 'recent', 'polls', 'say', 'approximately', '100', 'million', 'Americans', 'have', 'tried', 'pot', 'least', 'once', 'true', 'still', 'less', 'then', 'third', 'Shows', 'Weeds', 'make', 'pot', 'everywhere', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'admit', 'hypocrite.I', 'found', 'ahem', 'adult', 'scenes', 'be', 'bit', 'offensive', 'know', 'was', 'made', 'Showtime', 'still', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'plot', 'create', 'artistic', 'point', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'very', 'much', 'information', 'even', 'fewer', 'images.Overall', 'fun', 'show', 'watch', 'can', 'put', 'judgment', 'hold', 'kind', 'fun', 'see', 'what', 'predicament', 'Nancy', 'will', 'get', 'how', 'will', 'get', 'However', 'would', 'not', 'let', 'anyone', 'younger', '17', 'maybe', 'even', '18', 'watch', 'adult', 'scenes', 'drug', 'use', 'could', 'be', 'misinterpreted', 'younger', 'viewer']",Weeds: Season 1

Enter our heroine.You know, I never understood Kevin Nealon while he was on Saturday Night live, but here, he's outrageously entertaining playing the character of shallow Councilman Doug. I shouldn't single him out. Elizabeth Perkins is wonderful. Uncle Andy's lessons about life (all learned the hard way, apparently). Actually, practically everyone is great, which is weird.Initially when I watched Mary-Louise Parker, I wondered who she kept reminding me of... and then it hit me: she was precisely mimicking Bradley Whitford, with whom she co-starred in West Wing, according to IMDB. Or is Bradley copying her? Will have to see them pre-2000. It's just like Geena Davis and Jeff Goldblum. (Update: in Season 3, she loses the Bradley speak. Good move, I think.)If you are considering watching this, download an episode. Even if the drug premise offends you, the show is just too good to miss.

However this is a show that will be enjoyed by anyone who appreciates good acting and good storylines.The main focus of Weeds centers around Nancy Botwin (Mary Louise Parker). She's a widowed mother of two who supports her family by being the local pot dealer. As I said earlier people may shy away of this show because of that, and while it is the main storyline of the show, it's not the only one. I found myself enjoying it more than any reason for the fantastic acting of Parker. She nails this character. Everything about her is believeable. Though you can't base a show good on one actor alone, this one has plenty of fine actors.Another character I loved was Celia. She is played by Elizabeth Perkins and let me say this show could easily revolve around her if the writers wanted it to. She has the acting chops, great lines, a good story, a very enjoyable addition to the show. SNL fans will be happy to see Kevin Nealon in the cast as well. I'm not a huge Nealon fan and I honestly don't think he brings much to his role. However he is a big name and that adds to the overall quality to the show.This is a short season, only 10 episodes, but the story moves along nicely and will have you interested in seeing season 2 with it's great cliffhanger. Don't hesistate to see this show. I wasn't blown away with it though. It wasn't as witty as I heard it would be, not as funny as I thought it would be but one thing that surprised me was how deep you go into each characters story, and that's saying a lot with a short season.While I feel this season could have been better, it makes up for what it lacks in the drama and character development department.

What we discover is both funny and sad; failed marriages, cynical children, crooked local politics, and sexual peccadilloes. In the 1st season, the focus was really on the characters, all of whom, for all their quirks, are fairly easy to relate to. Even when tragedies strike, such as Celia's cancer, the series maintains a low-key charm to it.By season three, the lives of Nancy Botwin and Company have spiraled so out of control and reached such a feverish level of peril and dysfunction that the show has lost much of that low-key charm.

The first season of ""Weeds"" is funny, poignant, sexy, and intelligent, making each 27-minute or so episode fly by.  Like ""The Sopranos"", another show about criminals attempting to shoehorn their illegal activities into otherwise normal lifestyles, ""Weeds"" doesn't take the obvious approach and make its storylines about learning that crime doesn't pay; rather, it takes the more realistic (some would say cynical) path, essentially saying that people are going to do what they're going to do, stopping or adapting an activity only when their livelihood or freedom is threatened.Having said said, however, Mary-Louise Parker's drug-dealing soccer mom character, Nancy (though it's judo matches rather than soccer matches that she attends), is still generally sympathetic, seeming to have gotten into the marijuana business only to support her family after her husband's death.  Not that she has any real pangs of guilt over her endeavors... in fact, she positively lights up when she figures out new and exciting ways to deal pot and stay one step ahead of ""the man"".All ten episodes here are fun and involving, and go the extra mile by giving us a variety of interesting storylines outside the ""Nancy dealing drugs"" thing.  In particular, much attention is paid to issues related to a suddenly single mother now having to be her kids' sole emotional support, not just financial support.  And there's an absolutely bang-up season-ending cliff hanger, which nicely marries (some would say violently throws together) Nancy's personal life and her ""dealing"" life.  It makes you want to pick up season two of the show immediately, which is what I did.Season one of ""Weeds"" is presented on two DVDs in a cute package.  There's also a handful of fun behind-the-scenes featurettes, but the contents of the shorter featurettes are pretty much duplicated scene for scene in the longer featurettes.  They should have just included the longer featurettes.  But that's the only quibble I have about this very entertaining set.And if you need one more reason to purchase this first season of ""Weeds""?

The neighbors and friends are equally interesting (particularly the character played by Elizabeth Perkins). I find the show very compelling and addictive.

Arguably one of the wittiest, immoral, well-written shows on TV, Weeds captures the essence of Suburbia in a way that Desperate Housewives never can. Part of that comes from the fact that it is on Showtime and can therefore be a bit more dark in its themes and subject matter. The other part is the writing, which satirizes perfectly the inane perfectionism that drives most rich white people. The credit sequence alone does this better than any other show I've ever seen. On top of that, you've got a stellar cast of multi-layered characters getting involved in all kinds of debauchery that constantly escalates and doesn't feel ""written"" like most shows that seem to build arbitrarily based on the weekly whims of the writer's. Weeds feels like one big, long story segmented for TV.Fresh, original, occasionally quite seedy, Weeds is everything that a TV show should be. Sure there are some plot-lines that are a bit familiar, but nothing too bad. Overall, the feel of the show is perfect for anyone who rolls their eyes at Desperate Housewives or other shows claiming to thoroughly lampoon modern Americana. Weeds fulfills this role with gusto and grace, keeping viewers high on its deranged spirit all the way through. It should be noted however as potent and funny as Weeds is, it is SEVERELY ADDICTING, mainly due to the fact that those shrewd writers I mentioned are highly, highly adept as providing cliff hanger endings that often seem to emerge out of nowhere but always, always, always leave you wanting more.

Like DEAD LIKE ME, WEEDS starts out a little bit on the overobvious side, and ""crude"" isn't the word for its brand of social satire.  (I will say that WEEDS does a far better job of seeming to be filmed on US soil than the Canada-centric DEAD LIKE ME.)  But once you get hooked on the show, you won't be sorry you pitched in and bought the whole set of 10 episodes, because they go like wildfire, and by the time the week was up, all we had left were the sticks and stems of this boxed set, and a whole pack of memories.Mary Louise Parker has the role of a lifetime playing the suburban mom, widowed and without funds, who turns to dealing pot to make ends meet (and more).  Parker has always been a talented actress but here, the great thing is that she seems to be having fun; she's fully alive for the first time on screen.  I keep thinking that eventually she and Justin Kirk are going to have to get together (he plays the ne'er do well black sheep brother of her late husband), but the show's writers have delighftully tabled this romance for now.  For even if some of the individual episodes seem forced or undercooked, long term narrative arc writing is always surprising, rich.  You get the feeling that the people behind the show know what they're doing.  At first I was thinking, yes, it's cute for one episode, but how could a show like this be sustained?  Now I don't worry about that any more.  OK, I'm in the minority about Celia (Elizabeth Perkins).  In my opinion, she's awful and the writing for her character is absurdly bad.  To others, I know, she's a camp hoot.  I hate her, her relationship with her fat little daughter, her mirror relationship with her own mother, everything is hit you over the head twice.

989031,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B000FFJYE8,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[1, 1]","While other suburban parodiesfocus on the banality, this show stands out by its focus on the unexpressed anger and desperation dragging the white suburbs down. But where past putative hits like Twin Peaks sank under the weight of their pathetic earnestness, this succeeds (and has for several seasons) by presenting in a thirty-minute sitcom format. This playful approach keeps watchers loyal, where other shows are their own worst enemies.Mary-Louise Parker plays Nancy Botwin, a widowed mother who has kept her figure but lost everything else when her husband died. So she did what any of us would do: she starts dealing pot. She's like a laundry list of what suburban women should never be: widowed, liberal, Jewish, insolvent, smarter than the men she knows, and of course, a criminal. This lets her stand outside her environment and see the secrets her neighbors try to deny.This show breaks new ground in many ways. Though not the first to eschew a laugh track, it was probably the first to do so successfully. And while it's not the darkest sitcom I've ever seen (the first season of The John Larroquette Show holds that rank, though the network cowarded out by the second year), it uses its darkness in a way that doesn't become oppressive, to spotlight the characters and emphasize their many secrets and frustrations.As a comedy with hints of drama, and a layer cake of family saga and crime satire, this show refuses to be pinned down. Which is why I love it. Where too many other shows desperately mug in an attempt to fit into accepted categories and appease advertisers, this one maintains its own identity. It's like little else I've ever seen. And I hope it continues to maintain its unique character long into the future.",5,Unique Dark Comedy,1359936000,"02 4, 2013",2013,1738,"['other', 'suburban', 'parodiesfocus', 'banality', 'show', 'out', 'focus', 'unexpressed', 'anger', 'desperation', 'dragging', 'white', 'suburbs', 'down', 'where', 'past', 'putative', 'hits', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'sank', 'weight', 'pathetic', 'earnestness', 'several', 'seasons', 'presenting', 'thirty-minute', 'sitcom', 'format', 'playful', 'approach', 'watchers', 'loyal', 'where', 'other', 'shows', 'are', 'own', 'worst', 'enemies.Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'Nancy', 'Botwin', 'widowed', 'mother', 'who', 'kept', 'figure', 'lost', 'everything', 'else', 'when', 'husband', 'died', 'did', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'dealing', 'pot', 'laundry', 'list', 'what', 'suburban', 'women', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'widowed', 'liberal', 'Jewish', 'insolvent', 'smarter', 'men', 'course', 'criminal', 'stand', 'environment', 'see', 'secrets', 'neighbors', 'try', 'deny.This', 'show', 'new', 'ground', 'many', 'ways', 'not', 'first', 'eschew', 'laugh', 'track', 'was', 'probably', 'first', 'do', 'so', 'successfully', 'not', 'darkest', 'sitcom', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'first', 'season', 'John', 'Larroquette', 'Show', 'rank', 'network', 'cowarded', 'out', 'second', 'year', 'darkness', 'way', ""n't"", 'become', 'oppressive', 'spotlight', 'characters', 'emphasize', 'many', 'secrets', 'frustrations.As', 'comedy', 'hints', 'drama', 'layer', 'cake', 'family', 'saga', 'crime', 'satire', 'show', 'be', 'pinned', 'down', 'Which', 'why', 'love', 'Where', 'too', 'many', 'other', 'shows', 'desperately', 'mug', 'attempt', 'fit', 'accepted', 'categories', 'appease', 'advertisers', 'one', 'own', 'identity', 'like', 'little', 'else', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'hope', 'maintain', 'unique', 'character', 'long', 'future']",Weeds: Season 1
989032,A22TZUXUKA11SQ,B000FFJYE8,"K. Hinton ""avid reader""","[4, 6]","Mary Louise Parker plays Nancy Botwin, a single mother whose husband recently died leaving her with no means of supporting her children.  Her sons, 10-year-old Shane and 15-year-old Silas, have no idea what avenues her mother has taken to avoid losing the lifestyle to which her family has become accustomed. This includes karate lessons, DSL, a live-in maid and a number of other things that kids take for granted. Nancy, head of the Healthy Children's Committee in her school PTA, takes the only road she sees at the time and starts selling marijuana.This show is funny and poignant in equal measure.  It's hard to imagine that in small-town suburbia, in this case Agrestic, California, there is a soccer mom watching her kid's game and dealing pot on the side.  This is balanced nicely with the story of a woman trying to support her family and pull her life back together at the same time.  The loss of her husband is a critical plot point in both Nancy's life and the development of her sons.  It's hard not to love this show with the way it blends comedy and drama so effortlessly.The supporting cast includes Nancy's food-obsessed best friend Celia, the gun-toting, trash-talking Black family who sells her drugs, her free-loading, unemployed brother-in-law and a number of stereotypical affluent suburbanites who just happen to smoke pot on the side. Also, look out for guest appearances from Jeffrey Dean Morgan (who played Denny on the second season of Grey's Anatomy) as Nancy's deceased husband and Allison Janney (who plays C.J. on the West Wing) as an attorney and marijuana advocate.This show is as addictive as the product Nancy sells and I would definitely recommend it to a friend.",4,Yet another reason to need cable,1152662400,"07 12, 2006",2006,1699,"['Mary', 'Louise', 'Parker', 'Nancy', 'Botwin', 'single', 'mother', 'husband', 'recently', 'died', 'leaving', 'means', 'supporting', 'children', 'sons', '10-year-old', 'Shane', '15-year-old', 'Silas', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'mother', 'taken', 'avoid', 'losing', 'lifestyle', 'family', 'become', 'accustomed', 'karate', 'lessons', 'DSL', 'live-in', 'maid', 'number', 'other', 'things', 'kids', 'take', 'granted', 'Nancy', 'head', 'Healthy', 'Children', 'Committee', 'school', 'PTA', 'only', 'road', 'time', 'starts', 'selling', 'marijuana.This', 'show', 'funny', 'poignant', 'equal', 'measure', 'hard', 'imagine', 'small-town', 'suburbia', 'case', 'Agrestic', 'California', 'soccer', 'mom', 'watching', 'kid', 'game', 'dealing', 'pot', 'side', 'balanced', 'nicely', 'story', 'woman', 'trying', 'support', 'family', 'pull', 'life', 'back', 'together', 'same', 'time', 'loss', 'husband', 'critical', 'plot', 'point', 'Nancy', 'life', 'development', 'sons', 'hard', 'not', 'love', 'show', 'way', 'comedy', 'drama', 'so', 'effortlessly.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Nancy', 'food-obsessed', 'best', 'friend', 'Celia', 'gun-toting', 'trash-talking', 'Black', 'family', 'who', 'drugs', 'free-loading', 'unemployed', 'brother-in-law', 'number', 'stereotypical', 'affluent', 'suburbanites', 'who', 'just', 'happen', 'smoke', 'pot', 'side', 'Also', 'look', 'out', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'who', 'played', 'Denny', 'second', 'season', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'Nancy', 'deceased', 'husband', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'who', 'C.J', 'West', 'Wing', 'attorney', 'marijuana', 'advocate.This', 'show', 'as', 'addictive', 'product', 'Nancy', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'friend']",Weeds: Season 1

989038,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000FFJYE8,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 6]","I think that in its heart of hearts, ""Weeds"" wants to be a black comedy.  After all, when her husband drops dead, Nancy Botwin (Mary-Louise Parker) decides to support her family, which consists of her two sons, Silas (Hunter Parrish) and Shane (Alexander Gould), by selling marijuana in suburbia.  Not just in any suburb, but the gated community of Agrestic, California, where the other women might look like they are from Stepford but their topics of discussion are strictly Peyton Place.  But I do not think we need to go back that far to example the dynamic of ""Weeds,"" because what we are talking about here are the ""Desperate Housewives"" of Wisteria Lane on drugs, and as the title gives away, the drug of choice here is marijuana.  Actually, that would be the ""herb of your choice,"" because that is the special ingredient in all of the Agrestic Herbal Recipes includes on the special features of the season one DVD.Marijuana is not a gateway drug in the wacky world of ""Weeds,"" and Nancy might be a dealer but she is also a mom, so if somebody starts dealing to 10 year olds she is more than willing to find them jumping on a bed in their underwear and to sit on them and read them the riot act (okay, actually she has to use coercion, but you get the moral position here).  The people of Agrestic do not do harder drugs, they just smoke weed, and eat brownies (and hash browns and pot roast and, well, you get the idea).  So, yes, just about everybody on the show is doing drugs, but they are not doing bad drugs, they are just smoking (and eating) weed.  In other words, weed is not a hard drug it is a soft drug and people who take it get silly and or horny, which for a half-hour dramedy (black dramedy?) that airs on Showtime would pretty much be a prerequisite.  Funny that things have not really progressed all that much from the classic anti-marijuana films of the 1930s, like ""Reefer Madness"" and ""Assassin of Youth,"" which proved once and for all that smoking grass makes you giggle uncontrollably.Selling weed is only part of Nancy's life, because both of her sons are presenting her with problems.  Silas wants to have sex with her girlfriends and Shane, who was with his father when he dropped dead, likes to respond aggressively to being bullied, which means he gets suspended from elementary school a lot (""You Can't Miss the Bear"").  One of the few people in Agrestic who is not smoking Nancy's weed is Celia Hodes (Elizabeth Perkins), the president of the Agrestic Elementary School P.T.A., whose older daughter is the one Silas wants to have sex with.  Celia is the sort of person who thinks diet soft drinks should be available to the kids at school and who calls her youngest daughter Isabelle (Allie Grant) ""Isabelly"" as part of constant pressure to lose weight.  This is a mother-daughter war that gets dirty a way you have seldom seen before (""Good S*** Lollipop"").  Then again, Celia does teach us that there are clearly worse things in this world than having Coke bottles from a Cessna fall through your roof (""Fashion of the Christ"").""Weeds"" could be an interesting show without the marijuana because, after all, we are talking about Mary Louise Parker and Elizabeth Perkins here, which is a pretty dynamic duo (Parker grabbed a Golden Globe for her role and Perkins is up for an Emmy this year).  But some of the funniest stuff here happens when the white lady goes to the house of her supplier, Heylia James (Tonye Patano), and proves how far in over her head she is in this new business venture.  Fortunately Heylia's nephew Conrad Shepard (Romany Malco) takes a liking to Nancy or she would really be up the proverbial creek without a paddle (""The Punishment Lighter"").  Nancy's C.P.A., Doug Wilson (Kevin Nealon) is helping her hide her income when he is not buying her weed, and over the course of the first season she slowly puts together a support group that can help her move up the food chain of her chosen business.  Unfortunately her brother-in-law Andy (Justin Kirk) has showed up and moved in and the guy is a walking advertisement for weed being too much of a good thing at some point that he apparently reached years ago (""Lude Awakening"").In terms of ideological assault ""Weeds"" burns its satire at both ends of the political spectrum, which would mean everybody will find something to laugh at and/or be offended by, or probably both.  This might be an idealized version of the marijuana business, but Nancy has spunk and it suddenly occurs to me that this show might also be ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" on drugs, because we have the feeling that Nancy just might make it after all.  That is until the final shot of the first season when she turns on the light in the bathroom and sees what is embroidered on the shirt she grabbed to put on when she got out of bed in the middle of the night (""The Godmother"").  The second season should be interesting and hopefully Showtime will keep ""Weeds"" around longer than they did ""Huff.""  Final Note: Gould was the voice of both Nemo in ""Finding Nemo"" and Bambi in ""Bambi II,"" which is why he sounds so familiar but you cannot place the face.",4,"You have seen ""Desperate

But getting through that, and moving through the rest of the season was fun and funny and sometimes touching.  This is a terrific show about a new widow (Nancy, played by Mary-Louise Parker) trying to raise two boys and provide for them after her husband dies suddenly.We never saw how she got into selling pot, but the focus of the show is showing Nancy trying to get her new 'business' to grow (excuse the pun) while trying to keep it secret from her kids, housekeeper and her best friend (Celia, played by Elizabeth Perkins).While the Golden Globe for best actress in a comedy went to Parker, I really think the funniest character in the program is Elizabeth Perkins.  I love how she shaved her husbands hair off after she found out he cheated on her.  She swaps her overweight daughters chocolate stash for laxatives and pays the price when her daughter gets her back by switching her pills to imodium.It's a break from the norm, but let me tell you this show is definately worth watching.  It's dark and funny and thoroughly enjoyable.  It's got a great cast and it's a show not afraid to take chances.  I especially love the unexpected twist in the very last scene of the last episode in this season.

Some reviewers have pointed out that the characters are hypocritical and not very likeable, but that's what gives them complexity and makes them interesting.  ""Full House"" this is not.  That aside, the general tone of the series is not terribly serious, so however you feel about drugs and the actions of Nancy and the other characters, it's still a quite enjoyable and fun show.I felt that since the producers of this DVD did not see fit to release the episodes in their original aspect ratio, that was worth knocking off a good two points.  It's often easy to tell that things are framed too closely here.  It's incomprehensible why they would not release the best possible version on DVD, especially when they expect people to pay for them.  The set does include some interesting extras and featurettes.  I also listened to all the commentaries, and what annoyed me were those of show creator Jengi Kohan--on her tracks she sounds as though she's coming out of anesthesia.

But I've found ""Weeds"" to be pretty interesting, frequently amusing, and sometimes rather bittersweet.  I think a lot of that has to do with Mary-Louise Parker as Nancy.  I could readily see myself following a woman as beguiling as that into a criminal conspiracy.  Another thing that I like is that the show doesn't sermonize about the need to legalize or decriminalize dope.  It just sort of lets the viewers decide on that point.A few things in the show don't exactly ring true...like the DEA agent who becomes enamored of Nancy to the point of marrying her so he can't be forced to testify against her.  I'm pretty certain something like that would show up on his periodic reinvestigations for his security clearance (and maybe his polygraphs as well).  Also, while I give kudos to the show for casting an actress who is actually deaf to play the role of the girlfriend of Nancy's son Silas, it's a bit ridiculous to have a 26 year old playing someone who is 17 tops (would have been smarter to find someone about 20 or so and looked younger).Also, occasionally, the show gets a bit disgusting, most notably with plot threads around Nancy's wayward brother-in-law Andy...who I think in real life would be a sociopath given his behavior.But for the most part, ""Weeds"" is fun and I think if you liked ""the Sopranos"" and could come to care a bit about people who were far more violent and criminal in nature on that show than any of the ""Weeds"" cast in seasons one and two, I think you should give it a try, just one ""puff"".",4,I'm surprised I like this...,1306713600,"05 30, 2011",2011,1679,"[""'m"", 'definitely', 'square', ""'ve"", 'never', 'used', 'drugs', ""'m"", 'not', 'likely', 'do', ""n't"", 'support', 'legalization', 'decriminalization', 'marijuana', ""'ve"", 'found', 'Weeds', 'be', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'frequently', 'amusing', 'sometimes', 'rather', 'bittersweet', 'think', 'lot', 'do', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'Nancy', 'could', 'readily', 'see', 'following', 'woman', 'as', 'beguiling', 'criminal', 'conspiracy', 'thing', 'like', 'show', ""n't"", 'sermonize', 'need', 'legalize', 'decriminalize', 'dope', 'just', 'sort', 'viewers', 'decide', 'point.A', 'few', 'things', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'ring', 'true', 'DEA', 'agent', 'who', 'enamored', 'Nancy', 'point', 'marrying', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'forced', 'testify', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'certain', 'something', 'would', 'show', 'up', 'periodic', 'reinvestigations', 'security', 'clearance', 'maybe', 'polygraphs', 'as', 'well', 'Also', 'give', 'kudos', 'show', 'casting', 'actress', 'who', 'actually', 'deaf', 'play', 'role', 'girlfriend', 'Nancy', 'son', 'Silas', 'bit', 'ridiculous', 'have', '26', 'year', 'old', 'playing', 'someone', 'who', '17', 'tops', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'smarter', 'find', 'someone', '20', 'so', 'looked', 'younger', '.Also', 'occasionally', 'show', 'bit', 'disgusting', 'most', 'notably', 'plot', 'threads', 'Nancy', 'wayward', 'brother-in-law', 'Andy', 'who', 'think', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'sociopath', 'given', 'behavior.But', 'most', 'part', 'Weeds', 'fun', 'think', 'liked', 'Sopranos', 'could', 'come', 'care', 'bit', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'far', 'more', 'violent', 'criminal', 'nature', 'show', 'Weeds', 'cast', 'seasons', 'one', 'two', 'think', 'should', 'give', 'try', 'just', 'one', 'puff']",Weeds: Season 1

This being my first time seeing the show, I found it very entertaining throughout and can't wait for the second season to come out.I was very surprised with how much material was packed onto the Blu Ray disc - nearly 5 hours of HD Video (10 episodes a 30 minutes each), a Dolby EX audio track as well as a DTS 6.1 track. Commentary tracks, bonus featurettes and some neat features that I've yet to see on a Blu Ray disc prior to this (the ability to adjust menu transitions as well as bookmark scenes for later viewing).The sound quality is fantastic - the 6.1 sound from the DTS track (even for a TV show) sounded great to me even though there aren't a whole lot of surround effects. The picture quality, however, was very mixed. Some scened looked great while others didn't look so hot. This is very common in dark scenes and did not come as a big surprise to me. Overall I'd give the video quality about a 3.5.For a disc with so much content at such a low price (under $20), I can't help but recommend it even to those who own the show on DVD.

989059,A10X0JN8KTK89H,B000FFJYE8,ninjasuperstar,"[16, 21]","Like Little Children, American Beauty, and Edward Scissorhands, Weeds portrays a planned community as a forgotten circle of Dante's Inferno.  Suburban life really isn't the gated paradise the brochures from the housing committee promise; rather, it's a cesspool of petty people with too much money and nothing to do with their lives.  We've seen these kinds of shows and movies before.  What's unique about Weeds is that there really aren't any sympathetic characters.  Even the children in the show come off as selfish demons (who seem far too wise and ironic for their respective ages).  The cast is superb.  The things they do and say make you alternately cringe, laugh, and open your mouth wide to say, ""He did not just do that!""  And it's worth mentioning that the end credits to each episode generally feature a very funny and sometimes dirty folk or pop song that serves as an audio metaphor for the entire episode.  I enjoy the show's attempt to tell a quirky and increasingly unrealistic tale that must be a tremendous challenge for the writers.On the other hand, the show doesn't evolve much further than a writer's delight: So much of the dialogue is simply a stream of creative, new curse words and phrases.  These start off as shocking and funny, but the veneer wears thin when you realize that it's just a device to divide your attention from the fact that very little is happening in the show, because all of the characters are made of the same selfish mold.  It reminds me of how Family Guy uses the same device in nearly episode: Something happens and Peter will be reminded of the time when he [fill in the blank], and the show proceeds to randomize the plot with a barely relevant flashback.  Again, funny for a while, but it gets old fast.I should say that I'm not at all put off by Weed's liberal politics, with which I tend to sympathize, and which is probably the most consistent (biased?) part of the show.  Yet something essential is missing from the discussions on race, immigration, drug trafficking, teen pregnancy, single motherhood, suburban life, religion, draft dodging, and so on.  In the end, I have a sinking feeling that the show itself is selfish.  The show, like the characters in it, wants to gate itself off from the views of dissenters like conservatives and the religious.  But that's the way extremism works: Just as fundamentalism breeds no irony and imposes a black/white morality onto humanity, material secularism obfuscates personal responsibility and self-discipline.

It's sort of funny, but I would not invest in the purchase of the DVDs.  I find the overall tone to be a little too smug and self-congratulatory for my taste.And I want to say that I find the theme song to be absolutely ghastly.  If I were reviewing the opening credits/theme music, I would give it zero stars.  There are a couple of reasons I say this.  One, I don't enjoy off-key singing.  Two, I don't like stupid lyrics.  The ""little boxes"" referred to are upscale homes that clearly nobody is grateful for.  I would like to know what is so awful about living in a tract home where the houses all look similar.  Apparently not individualistic enough?I'm guessing that the song is supposed to be some sort of hipster irony.  As I said before, too smug.

It juggles comedy, satire, and drama so successfully that you can never really predict which scene will bring what.  It's a tightly written series with a great cast that all comes together in one of the most utterly addictive television shows that is currently on air.I love that the show doesn't condone or condemn marijuana.  I love that this isn't a show you have to be high for, but it's also so intelligently and thoughtfully written that it appeals to people who just may be high when watching.  I love that it isn't afraid to show the petty and ugly sides of the characters we're supposed to sympathize with.  And while I usually love long, twenty-five episode seasons, I love that this season is made up of ten half-hour episodes that are more like slices-of-life than any noticeable story arc or anthology.  I love that you can pretty much sit down on a lazy afternoon and watch the entire season and still have the night to yourself.The first season of ""Weeds"" is an air-tight, well done show that will appeal to the stoner crowd, theDesperate Housewivescrowd, and virtually anyone in between.

989063,A2AZ03N9Y7DBU1,B000FFJYE8,"P. Branch ""modifiedcartrader.com""","[3, 3]","Ok so this show is a part comedy/ part drama, you have to remember that while watching it that it's completely unrealistic except for a few aspects. I have watched this series through season 6 & this is what I think, now remember this is only my opinion. You have your lead character, the mom, who after her husband dies unexpectedly needs to find a way to make money so that her family can maintain the lifestyle they live in a nice rich gated Southern California community suburb. Now in real life, there more than likely would've been somekind of savings or trustfund, she probably would've sold the house & moved the family into a cheaper neighborhood & there would also have been a $100,000plus life insurance policy to tide the family over, Soccer Mom's would've gotten off her rear & gone out & got a real job but this is Showtime TV because in real life no one really wants to work for anything, we want everything handed to us on a silver platter & if it's not then we'll take it illegally. So then, we never really see how Nancy, (The Mother), gets started with her supplier which is by the way the stereotypical black family that includes Big Momma & her daughter who is pregnant with no father around & then there's also her nephew who's a pot making genius. Nancy quickly learns the ways of the drug trade from Big Momma & quickly gets a large customer base. You also have Nancy's 2 son's, one of which is too smart for his own good, the other who's the typical california kid who gets laid whenever he wants by all his teenage airhead female classmates. There's her brother-in-law who moves in because he has no where else to go & despite the fact that he has no job & is a complete coward he's still a ladies man who can pull whatever, whenever. Other characters include her stuckup friend who's the lead of the PTA & who talks down to her chubby daughter & jewish husband & her accountant who's the corrupt leader of the city council. There's an Indian kid who turns out to be gay & your stereotypical hoochie momma ""Clinique"" whom he ends up having a baby with, you'll see how that happens. The story go's on from there through the seasons with tales of Nancy's dilemmas to make money & keep her family together. Seems every decision Nancy makes has an effect on all the characters involved & it's usually negative. As I progressed through the seasons I found myself waiting for something bad to happen to one of the main characters, i.e. getting killed but this has not happened at least not through season 6. Maybe the show should be called ""Luck & Stupidity In America"" because of the fact that Nancy is not a smart person. She constantly makes poor decisions like she has no common sense at all & has to use her family & so-called friends to bail her out of jam after jam, basically getting lucky over & over. She comes off as selfish alot of times & even though she sells weed & gets involved with a Mexican drug lord she still has an irritating sense of morality. Everytime you think she's reached the end of her rope & is about to get lead bangs on her forehead something pretty predictable happens to save her. Her dealings with the Mexicans made them look like total morons I mean there were a few times when I was like, C'mon, really but hey, it's a comedy/slash drama? It's supposed to be funny & unrealistic & that's what this is, a show  that is a fantasy look at what would happen if you made a goofy white housewife into a drug dealer. As far as hott women, IMO only the woman who plays Pilar(you'll see her when you get that far) is hott, & believe me she's smokin, MLP isn't hott to me at all with that huge forehead & giant evil dark brown eyes. So then, my reccomendation to any of you considering this series is to rent it & see what you think for yourself. Now remember it's TVMA so there's lots of cussing, nudity(mostly male unfortunately) & a bit of racism so there you were warned...",3,Draggin on...,1370736000,"06 9, 2013",2013,3925,"['Ok', 'so', 'show', 'part', 'comedy/', 'part', 'drama', 'have', 'remember', 'watching', 'completely', 'unrealistic', 'few', 'aspects', 'have', 'watched', 'series', 'season', '6', 'what', 'think', 'now', 'remember', 'only', 'opinion', 'have', 'lead', 'character', 'mom', 'who', 'husband', 'dies', 'unexpectedly', 'find', 'way', 'make', 'money', 'family', 'can', 'maintain', 'lifestyle', 'live', 'nice', 'rich', 'gated', 'Southern', 'California', 'community', 'suburb', 'Now', 'real', 'life', 'more', 'likely', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'somekind', 'savings', 'trustfund', 'probably', 'would', ""'ve"", 'sold', 'house', 'moved', 'family', 'cheaper', 'neighborhood', 'would', 'also', 'have', 'been', '100,000plus', 'life', 'insurance', 'policy', 'tide', 'family', 'Soccer', 'Mom', 'would', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'off', 'rear', 'gone', 'out', 'got', 'real', 'job', 'Showtime', 'TV', 'real', 'life', 'one', 'really', 'work', 'anything', 'want', 'everything', 'handed', 'silver', 'platter', 'not', 'then', ""'ll"", 'take', 'illegally', 'So', 'then', 'never', 'really', 'see', 'how', 'Nancy', 'Mother', 'started', 'supplier', 'way', 'stereotypical', 'black', 'family', 'Big', 'Momma', 'daughter', 'who', 'pregnant', 'father', 'around', 'then', 'also', 'nephew', 'who', 'pot', 'making', 'genius', 'Nancy', 'quickly', 'ways', 'drug', 'trade', 'Big', 'Momma', 'quickly', 'large', 'customer', 'base', 'also', 'have', 'Nancy', '2', 'son', 'one', 'too', 'smart', 'own', 'good', 'other', 'who', 'typical', 'california', 'kid', 'who', 'laid', 'whenever', 'teenage', 'airhead', 'female', 'classmates', 'her', 'brother-in-law', 'who', 'where', 'else', 'go', 'fact', 'job', 'complete', 'coward', 'still', 'ladies', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'pull', 'whatever', 'whenever', 'Other', 'characters', 'include', 'stuckup', 'friend', 'who', 'lead', 'PTA', 'who', 'talks', 'down', 'chubby', 'daughter', 'jewish', 'husband', 'accountant', 'who', 'corrupt', 'leader', 'city', 'council', 'Indian', 'kid', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'gay', 'stereotypical', 'hoochie', 'momma', 'Clinique', 'whom', 'up', 'having', 'baby', ""'ll"", 'see', 'how', 'story', 'go', 'seasons', 'tales', 'Nancy', 'dilemmas', 'make', 'money', 'keep', 'family', 'together', 'Seems', 'decision', 'Nancy', 'effect', 'characters', 'involved', 'usually', 'negative', 'progressed', 'seasons', 'found', 'waiting', 'something', 'bad', 'happen', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'i.e', 'getting', 'killed', 'not', 'happened', 'least', 'not', 'season', '6', 'Maybe', 'show', 'should', 'be', 'called', 'Luck', 'Stupidity', 'America', 'fact', 'Nancy', 'not', 'smart', 'person', 'constantly', 'poor', 'decisions', 'common', 'sense', 'use', 'family', 'so-called', 'friends', 'bail', 'jam', 'jam', 'basically', 'getting', 'lucky', 'off', 'selfish', 'alot', 'times', 'even', 'weed', 'involved', 'Mexican', 'drug', 'lord', 'still', 'irritating', 'sense', 'morality', 'Everytime', 'think', 'reached', 'end', 'rope', 'get', 'lead', 'bangs', 'forehead', 'something', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'happens', 'save', 'dealings', 'Mexicans', 'made', 'look', 'total', 'morons', 'mean', 'were', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'was', ""C'mon"", 'really', 'hey', 'comedy/slash', 'drama', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'unrealistic', 'what', 'show', 'fantasy', 'look', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'made', 'goofy', 'white', 'housewife', 'drug', 'dealer', 'As', 'far', 'hott', 'women', 'IMO', 'only', 'woman', 'who', 'Pilar', ""'ll"", 'see', 'when', 'get', 'far', 'hott', 'believe', 'smokin', 'MLP', ""n't"", 'hott', 'huge', 'forehead', 'giant', 'evil', 'dark', 'brown', 'eyes', 'So', 'then', 'reccomendation', 'considering', 'series', 'rent', 'see', 'what', 'think', 'Now', 'remember', 'TVMA', 'lots', 'cussing', 'nudity', 'mostly', 'unfortunately', 'bit', 'racism', 'there', 'were', 'warned']",Weeds: Season 1

I don't remember which one off hand, but I do remember the part about ticky-tacky houses all in a row from one of the novels.As for the subject matter, I'm not familiar with it but the economics of the situation are familiar. A woman starts a small, illegal business and finds herself with money problems. Her suppliers provide cheap merchandise, her cash flow can't be recorded, and she finds herself in competition with government sanctioned competitors. She slowly learns the ins and outs of how her business should operate.Mary-Louise Parker does a fine job as the woman with a new ""business."" However, Elizabeth Perkins does an outstanding job as her somewhat questionable best friend. How these two can even stand each other is something that always keeps me watching.Four stars out of five.

On this level, the show works pretty well most of the time, but really, how hard is it to satirize suburbia? Tim Burton played most of the same cards as Weeds way back in Edward Scissorhands. There are some new complications here, and even if it is familiar territory, it's still pretty fun.But what makes Weeds truly great TV is its cast of characters, who all go beyond the easy suburbanite stereotypes and become people you truly care about (with the exception of the oldest son, Silas, who is pretty one-note). The writing is sharp and funny, and the acting is superb across the board.However, it should be said that if you are steadfastly opposed to drug use, you probably will not like this show. It's pretty blas&eacute; about marijuana use, and the only real dangers the show associates with dealing pot are getting caught with it and being targeted by other dealers. That being said, the show is definitely not simpleminded pothead humor (sorry ""Half Baked"" fans).

989068,AOK72ELBI86GF,B000FFJYE8,Poker Face,"[7, 14]","UPDATED JAN.4th,2007: After stumbling across Season 2 episodes on Tv,I found the quality of the stories and pace to be so much better than the sluggish Season 1 episodes. Even the opening theme song is done differently each episode(with  a different singer each week or even as instrumental only). The acting and characters are also improved. I love ALL the characters and writing of Season 2 and wish they were 60 minutes long instead of 30 minutes. So,I guess it's worth watching Season 1 just to get you ready for the far superior and varied(though still as quirky) episodes of Season 2.The following review is for Season 1 only.I expected to enjoy this series so much more.However,even though Mary-Louise Parker shows enough cleavage to keep most men interested during even the slow parts,she still refuses to do any nudity,so all we get is the odd nude shot of various other people.Every man she meets seems to fall in love with her in mere minutes,even though she appears so sad.Yes,I know her husband just died,so her sadness makes sense,but I'm thinking it's more her cleavage rather than her occasional smile,that gets them all hooked.I like Mary in everything she appears in,but there are so many dry spots and slow scenes in this series that I'm grateful each episode is only about 30 minutes long.I thought much of the dialogue was clever and funny,but it didn't even come close to the greatness that Curb Your Enthusiasm or Huff easily reached in each episode.Yes,the series improved steadily with each episode,so the characters began to grow on me,especially by the last episode.I still can't get that great final scene out of my mind.That's the Mary-Louise Parker I was expecting.She can express so much with just her eyes.Not the somnolent Mary-Louise that exists for most of the series.No,I don't smoke pot and never will,but I suppose I'd be tempted to buy some from someone who looked like Mary and then I'd probably just give it to someone with glaucoma.The other actors do a wonderful job,which keeps this from getting too depressing.I even didn't mind Kevin Nealon(I hate him in Curb), and thought he helped keep things light whenever he appeared onscreen.Weeds has many songs that are quite catchy and are also well placed within each episode,which greatly added to the overall presentation of the series.The dvd extras are OK at best,but why no deleted scenes?So,do I plan to watch season 2?Probably not,unless Mary-Louise loosens up more.I've had enough for now.I enjoyed Weeds but just don't want to sit through anymore slow spots that I'm sure season 2 will also bring.So many people love this series,and I liked it enough to recommend it,but if you haven't seen the funnier Curb Your Enthusiasm or the both dramatic and funnier Huff,watch those Dvds first.Weeds may ruin your garden,but this series is done well enough not to ruin the time spent watching it.It's far from perfect,but Mary-Louise Parker is in it,so please pass me a joint,I'm too busy staring at her.",3,"Clever, but still needs some weed pulling here and there.

989069,A2HJB9J5O5CLPB,B000FFJYE8,R. A Rubin,"[4, 12]","I wish Netflix would identify the various cast names with pictures. Weeds, Season One has a large cast and I can't identify the characters to better guide you through a funny soap opera of suburban exaggeration.  Notice I did not claim there is a satire going on in the bedroom California community. Satire involves subtlety.  There's no subtlety here in Weeds. The opening credits start with the song about ""Little houses, Little houses,"" meaning that the burbs are cookie cutter, same same, so the jobs and life styles are boring.  But the weather is great, blue skies above, and really cool folks that smoke a lot of weed.  Since marijuana is illegal to possess or sell since the 1930's, there's a certain amount of hypocrisy going on, especially in dealing (er, no double entendre intended) with teenagers.I believe Weeds to be a success using a time tested method:  I want to know what happens in the next episode or season because the characters have interested me enough that I can identify with them, even think about them after the lights have gone out. It is not clear from the pilot how burb homemaker Parker with the face of many expressions got hooked up with a black family that deal dope. Everybody is white in California except when Parker must score her weed.  Then we're in the Ghetto with Momma's family. And how Parker's wacko brother-in-law knows the same black folks is beyond me?  A little too much coincidence there you know.  In fact, Weeds suffers from a crescendo of forced situations, but heck, it's all about white bread dealing dope, so we forgive just because of the smarmy concept.Teenagers in bed, burb wives in bed, positions, and heavy panting: these are the money shots of premium cable.  Otherwise, why would anyone pay extra for cable situation comedy shows? Is it something for the kids? NO!  But they watch this stuff anyhow.  That can't be good.  Just my opinion.Thirty million American's smoke dope often or once in a while.  They usually don't go crazy or miss their mortgage payment.  Is it a ""Gateway,"" drug.

989073,AS0L0O98NZ4SG,B000FFJYE8,S. Cameron,"[5, 9]","Created by Jenji Kohan, co-writer of such acclaimed shows as GILMORE GIRLS and WILL & GRACE, the premium cable dramedy WEEDS teeters on the precipice of witty and raunchy, at times just going a little bit over the top. With such quality content produced by Kohan in the past (arguably on local cable channels that encouraged stepping around the politically incorrect elephant in the room), it is a little disappointing to see that one of the shaky legs on which this ten-episode first season stands is the knowledge that on Showtime, you can write as many dirty words as you want. For me, it actually ended up detracting from the experience as a whole as potty-mouthed potsmokers rattled off all kinds of NBC no-nos; however clever the writing, it seems like Kohan and crew are trying to hit a quota for bathroom humor that really serves no purpose at all to the overall story...... which chronicles depressed widow Nancy Botwin (Golden Globe winner Mary-Louise Parker in her sharpest role yet) as she struggles to make ends meet in the backdrop of that cultural dystopia that is suburbia. After her husband's heart gave out on a morning jog, leaving her with two kids and an expensive house in the fictional community of Agrestic (fun fact: Agrestic is an anagram for ""cigarets""), she is forced to deal marijuana in her small community to the most unlikeliest of characters, such as city councilmember Doug Wilson. A new window opens for Nancy as she sees for the first time the seedy underbelly of her California community - stop me if you've heard this one before.Subplots and season arcs are either a little hazy or too linear, like the painfully formulaic pilot which introduces and then axes a few characters, who are written off or simply never mentioned at all in the rest of the season. Silas is Nancy's angry teenage son who just wants to have sex, Shane is a grade schooler who is working through his five steps of grief by acting out for attention (and singling himself out in school as the weirdo), deadbeat brother-in-law Andy (Justin Kirk, who previously starred with Parker in the role that got her the Golden Globe) does drugs and dodges the American government to avoid being mobilized in Iraq, and that's not to mention the host of simpering PTA moms with ""hillbilly heroin"" addictions and fashion fixations, the token black family that serves as Nancy's dealers, and various other middlemen. In the allotted thirty minutes of each episode, there is no time for the pace to be bogged down - it's straight to the chase, quickly developing connections between characters that seem a little contrived but believable all the same.As I'm writing this, the second season, highly anticipated after the sweet poison of last year's cliffhanger finale, is receiving quite a bit of hype with quirky commercials and magazine ads. Is it worth all the trouble? The honest, sober truth is: yes. It's fresh, it's funny, it cocks a satirical eyebrow in the face of steadfast right-wingers and addresses what America is coming to accept, and fast: green is the new alcohol, and it's not going to just disappear anytime soon. But why the vulgarity? Showtime's peach is looking more like a pit if last season's writers continue to feel out their boundaries and rub their base prose in viewers and cable channels' faces, while assuring the camera in DVD documentaries that this is the way Real Life is, the way Real People talk.",3,"""There's no secrets in this town.""",1155340800,"08 12, 2006",2006,3426,"['Created', 'Jenji', 'Kohan', 'co-writer', 'such', 'acclaimed', 'shows', 'GILMORE', 'GIRLS', 'WILL', 'GRACE', 'premium', 'cable', 'dramedy', 'WEEDS', 'teeters', 'precipice', 'witty', 'raunchy', 'times', 'just', 'going', 'little', 'bit', 'top', 'such', 'quality', 'content', 'produced', 'Kohan', 'past', 'arguably', 'local', 'cable', 'channels', 'encouraged', 'stepping', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'elephant', 'room', 'little', 'disappointing', 'see', 'one', 'shaky', 'legs', 'ten-episode', 'first', 'season', 'stands', 'knowledge', 'Showtime', 'can', 'write', 'many', 'dirty', 'words', 'want', 'actually', 'ended', 'up', 'detracting', 'experience', 'whole', 'potty-mouthed', 'potsmokers', 'rattled', 'off', 'kinds', 'NBC', 'no-nos', 'however', 'clever', 'writing', 'Kohan', 'crew', 'are', 'trying', 'hit', 'quota', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'really', 'purpose', 'overall', 'story', 'depressed', 'widow', 'Nancy', 'Botwin', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'winner', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'sharpest', 'role', 'yet', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'backdrop', 'cultural', 'dystopia', 'suburbia', 'husband', 'heart', 'gave', 'out', 'morning', 'jog', 'leaving', 'two', 'kids', 'expensive', 'house', 'fictional', 'community', 'Agrestic', 'fun', 'fact', 'Agrestic', 'anagram', 'cigarets', 'forced', 'deal', 'marijuana', 'small', 'community', 'most', 'unlikeliest', 'characters', 'such', 'city', 'councilmember', 'Doug', 'Wilson', 'new', 'window', 'opens', 'Nancy', 'first', 'time', 'seedy', 'underbelly', 'California', 'community', 'stop', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'one', 'before.Subplots', 'season', 'arcs', 'are', 'little', 'hazy', 'too', 'linear', 'painfully', 'formulaic', 'pilot', 'introduces', 'then', 'axes', 'few', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'written', 'off', 'simply', 'never', 'mentioned', 'rest', 'season', 'Silas', 'Nancy', 'angry', 'teenage', 'son', 'who', 'just', 'have', 'sex', 'Shane', 'grade', 'schooler', 'who', 'working', 'five', 'steps', 'grief', 'acting', 'out', 'attention', 'singling', 'school', 'weirdo', 'deadbeat', 'brother-in-law', 'Andy', 'Justin', 'Kirk', 'who', 'previously', 'starred', 'Parker', 'role', 'got', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'drugs', 'American', 'government', 'avoid', 'being', 'mobilized', 'Iraq', 'not', 'mention', 'host', 'simpering', 'PTA', 'moms', 'hillbilly', 'heroin', 'addictions', 'fashion', 'fixations', 'token', 'black', 'family', 'Nancy', 'dealers', 'various', 'other', 'middlemen', 'allotted', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'episode', 'time', 'pace', 'be', 'bogged', 'down', 'straight', 'chase', 'quickly', 'developing', 'connections', 'characters', 'seem', 'little', 'contrived', 'believable', 'same.As', ""'m"", 'writing', 'second', 'season', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'sweet', 'poison', 'last', 'year', 'cliffhanger', 'finale', 'receiving', 'quite', 'bit', 'hype', 'quirky', 'commercials', 'magazine', 'ads', 'trouble', 'honest', 'sober', 'truth', 'yes', 'fresh', 'funny', 'satirical', 'eyebrow', 'face', 'steadfast', 'right-wingers', 'what', 'America', 'coming', 'accept', 'fast', 'green', 'new', 'alcohol', 'not', 'going', 'just', 'disappear', 'anytime', 'soon', 'why', 'vulgarity', 'Showtime', 'peach', 'looking', 'more', 'pit', 'last', 'season', 'writers', 'continue', 'feel', 'out', 'boundaries', 'rub', 'base', 'prose', 'viewers', 'cable', 'channels', 'assuring', 'camera', 'DVD', 'documentaries', 'way', 'Real', 'Life', 'way', 'Real', 'People', 'talk']",Weeds: Season 1

Fueled by lots of funny ""look-at-the-innocent-old-ladies-with-the-ganja"" jokes and a young, manic Colin Ferguson, ""Saving Grace"" worked and worked well.""Weeds"" is the American retelling of this charming tale.  While ""SG"" poked a lot of fun at the stiff English upper lip sent all aquiver after a few luxurious drags, ""Weeds"" sets its gunsights squarely on American Suburbia.  Set in the androgynous, heartless Eden that is Agrestic, California, ""Weeds"" does nothing if it does not shred the ideal picture of life in America for those who are not Wealthy, but who are in fact very well off.Our heroine, Nancy (Mary-Louise Parker), is a struggling widow following the shocking death of her husband - a sudden heart-attack for a guy who appears to have been healthy as a horse (we see him in some home movies).  She's got a huge house in Agrestic for her two boys, a nanny, and no job.  So naturally she turns to dealing pot, as everyone in Agrestic who appears to be virtuous and true (PTA members, lawyers, accountants) is actually nothing but a ravenous pot-head.  Indeed, perhaps the only adults we don't see getting baked are Nancy's dealers, a shockingly-black family in this lily-white enclave.  Nancy is a natural dealer, both charming and desperate enough to do what's necessary.  She's also got an entrepreneurial gift, and soon she's the Godmother of the local pot infrastructure.While Nancy is our focus, there are plenty of minor characters who flesh out this story.  There are too many to name, but Elizabeth Perkins' Celia - PTA witch, suffering wife, and now coping with breast cancer - almost steals the show.  But it's unfair to single her out too much - this isn't a true ensemble cast a la ""The Wire,"" but there are lots of terrific ""minor"" characters here.More savage than ""dirty,"" there's more than a fair amount of ""adult subject matter"" that will make you think twice about allowing your kids to watch ""Weeds.""

It's funny and somewhat realistic.  The premise is that Parker is a recently widowed mom living in an expensive LA suburb.  To make ends meet she sells marijuana to her white, middle-class neighbors after buying it from a black family in a less affluent area.This show is witty, sexy, and compelling.  If you watch about 3 episodes you'll be hooked.  The cast is excellent.  In addition to Parker in the lead role, you also have Elizabeth Perkins as the snooty neighbor/friend, Romany Malco (from The Forty Year Old Virgin) as one of her suppliers, and Kevin Nealon as her main client/CPA/city councilman.The first ten episode follow Parker as he grows her business while trying to raise her two sons.  Along the way she has run ins with her competition and the law.  Plus she has to deal with her brother-in-law showing up and causing some extra problems.It's a great show and it has a lot in common with ""Big Love,"" ""Desperate Housewives,"" ""Six Feet Under,"" or any other show that tries to point out the stranger side of life.",5,Great Show,1155340800,"08 12, 2006",2006,1227,"['First', 'have', 'admit', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'long', 'time', ""'m"", 'probably', 'going', 'like', 'thing', 'in.That', 'said', 'one', ""'ve"", 'known', 'who', 'watched', 'show', 'loved', 'funny', 'somewhat', 'realistic', 'premise', 'Parker', 'recently', 'widowed', 'mom', 'living', 'expensive', 'LA', 'suburb', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'marijuana', 'white', 'middle-class', 'neighbors', 'buying', 'black', 'family', 'less', 'affluent', 'area.This', 'show', 'witty', 'sexy', 'compelling', 'watch', '3', 'episodes', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hooked', 'cast', 'excellent', 'addition', 'Parker', 'lead', 'role', 'also', 'have', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'snooty', 'neighbor/friend', 'Romany', 'Malco', 'Forty', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'one', 'suppliers', 'Kevin', 'Nealon', 'main', 'client/CPA/city', 'councilman.The', 'first', 'ten', 'episode', 'follow', 'Parker', 'business', 'trying', 'raise', 'two', 'sons', 'way', 'run', 'ins', 'competition', 'law', 'deal', 'brother-in-law', 'showing', 'up', 'causing', 'extra', 'problems.It', 'great', 'show', 'lot', 'common', 'Big', 'Love', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'Six', 'Feet', 'other', 'show', 'point', 'out', 'stranger', 'side', 'life']",Weeds: Season 1

While Weeds carries a strong cast of characters that are easy to relate to in most cases, a wonderful cast and some very crafty writers, the bulk of its content is comedic in nature. Some of this comedic material is downright twisted. But that's what makes the show so good. Episodes are only half an hour long, which makes them easily accessible. One should be able to pick up the show at any point and quickly get an easy understanding of what's happened in the past. Surprisingly enough, this doesn't keep the show from getting monotonous for the more hardcore fan. And it doesn't hurt that the show exudes a good deal of sexual charge. The only minor drawback for me has been a lack of dramatic emotional depth. While this prevents the show from getting too heavy, making sure that things stay lighthearted; one does eventually want to expect more realistic reaction from the personalities present here.

989087,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000FFJYE8,trebe,"[0, 0]","Debuting in 2005, the Showtime original production Weeds (2005-2012), explored some then new territory, as Mary-Louise Parker plays a newly widowed housewife, who turns to selling marijuana, to make ends meet.  Creating an absurd alternate reality, the program is more of an off-beat drama, centered on the use and distribution of drugs, mixed with lots of dysfunctional behavior, and in instances of ethnic stereotypes.It&#8217;s a provocative situation with lots of potential, but the first season of Weeds is a little slow and uneven.  While featuring some interesting storylines and snappy dialog, believability is low, and the plot is jumpy and very scattered, touching many areas, but not developing them very well.  Fortunately, the writing improves in season two and three, as Weeds becomes a much more entertaining and provocative watch.Quirky cartoonish characters are a big part of Weeds, and they are generally not a very likeable group.  Some can be ridiculous, petty, or annoying, but the cast does a nice job of making them come alive.  Mary-Louise Parker (Red) gives an engaging performance, bringing a real sense of wide-eyed delusional innocence to Nancy Price Botwin, a woman with some good intentions, who seems to alternate between desperate and bewildered, to cunningly determined, and confident.  Complex and wildly inconsistent, Nancy is an intriguing character who generates strong emotions.The supporting cast is very solid, with Elizabeth Perkins, Kevin Nealon (SNL), Justin Kirk, Hunter Parrish, Andy Milder, and Romany Malco.  Shoshanna Stern, who was one the best things aboutJericho, is convincing here, playing a high school senior.  Tonye Patano plays Helia James, a domineering mother, and dealer of weed, a character who seems like throwback to the kind of TV roles blacks had in the 1970&#8217;s.  The introduction of Martin Donovan as DEA agent Peter Scottson, sets the stage for some major developments in second season.Centered on the illegal activity and deception in the fictional suburb of Agrestic, California, Weeds is supposedly concerned with making a profound statement about the &#8220;shocking&#8221; things that can occur beneath the faade of an idealistic lifestyle.  This concept might have been edgy and impactful in the 1960&#8217;s, but by 2005, life in the suburbs had surely lost any such mythic appeal.  As the launching pad for an eclectic eight year journey, Season One should not be missed by fans, however it falls short in comparison to some of the that follow.Songs are an important element, used to reinforce the mood.  Sometimes the selections work, but other times the music is questionable, or even aggravating.  The series theme song &#8220;Little Boxes&#8221; is exceptionally irritating, but fortunately the music is mostly a minor annoyance.

However, the reviews for the show have been consistently very good, so I decided to finally watch a few episodes.  I liked them.  ""Weeds"" is about Nancy Botwin (Mary-Louise Parker), a mother who lives in an expensive planned community (fictional Agrestic, California) and was left penniless when her husband unexpectedly dropped dead jogging.  She turns to dealing pot to keep up her tony life-style, and it turns out that she's pretty good at it.  The first few episodes show her adjusting to the absurdity or her new career and balancing her drug dealing with raising her two sons, teenaged Silas and the pre-pubescent Shane, who are adjusting to their father's death.The show relies on this clever conceit of the drug-dealing mom for much of its humor, but at its heart ""Weeds"" is a devious satire of suburbia.  Nancy may seem immoral selling drugs in order to make her Range Rover payments and to buy the steady stream of iced coffees she totes everywhere; however, she is far from being the most deviant character.  PTA uber-mom Celia (Elizabeth Perkins), for example, has a cheating husband, an overweight daughter whom she tries to browbeat daily to watch her calories, and a teenaged daughter whom she sends to boarding school after she sleeps with Silas.The show is well-written and offers plenty of laughs, and the acting is terrific.  I'm not usually a fan of Mary-Louise Parker, as she too often seems depressed and mopey in most roles.  However, she's very good in this career-defining role - even sexy at times.  She's received two Emmy nominations for Best Actress in a Comedy and a win in that category at the Golden Globes.  The crowded supporting cast is joined by Heylia (Tonye Patano), Nancy's sassy supplier, along with her family members, Vaneeta and Conrad.  Finally, Kevin Nealon plays Doug, the marijuana-crazy CPA who helps Nancy run her business and also serves on the Agrestic City Council.  Many of the biggest laughs are supplied by Heylia, although people who appreciate pot humor will probably also like Doug.During the first season, ""Weeds"" does a great job of examining the hypocrisy of suburbia.  Nancy's drug dealing is balanced nicely with plots involving Shane's school problems, Celia's family and their issues, and so forth.  Unfortunately, mid-way through the season, Nancy's brother-in-law, Andy (Justin Kirk) arrives.  Andy is a juvenile, pot-smoking, responsibility-shirking idiot, and he is on-screen far too often in the second half of the season (and beyond).  In particular, as he and Doug become friends, the plots too often involve them being stoned and irresponsible - the very reasons I avoided ""Weeds"" initially.  However, overall, the show still remains strong despite these unlikeable characters.",4,"""I've got everything under control.""",1225584000,"11 2, 2008",2008,2846,"['do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'drug', 'humor', 'passed', 'Weeds', 'when', 'first', 'went', 'air', 'However', 'reviews', 'show', 'have', 'been', 'consistently', 'very', 'good', 'decided', 'finally', 'watch', 'few', 'episodes', 'liked', 'Weeds', 'Nancy', 'Botwin', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'mother', 'who', 'expensive', 'planned', 'community', 'fictional', 'Agrestic', 'California', 'was', 'left', 'penniless', 'when', 'husband', 'unexpectedly', 'dropped', 'dead', 'jogging', 'dealing', 'pot', 'keep', 'up', 'tony', 'life-style', 'out', 'pretty', 'good', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'show', 'adjusting', 'absurdity', 'new', 'career', 'balancing', 'drug', 'dealing', 'raising', 'two', 'sons', 'teenaged', 'Silas', 'pre-pubescent', 'Shane', 'who', 'are', 'adjusting', 'father', 'death.The', 'show', 'clever', 'conceit', 'drug-dealing', 'mom', 'much', 'humor', 'heart', 'Weeds', 'devious', 'satire', 'suburbia', 'Nancy', 'may', 'seem', 'immoral', 'selling', 'drugs', 'order', 'make', 'Range', 'Rover', 'payments', 'buy', 'steady', 'stream', 'iced', 'coffees', 'everywhere', 'however', 'far', 'being', 'most', 'deviant', 'character', 'PTA', 'uber-mom', 'Celia', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'example', 'cheating', 'husband', 'overweight', 'daughter', 'whom', 'browbeat', 'daily', 'watch', 'calories', 'teenaged', 'daughter', 'whom', 'boarding', 'school', 'Silas.The', 'show', 'well-written', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'acting', 'terrific', ""'m"", 'not', 'usually', 'fan', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'too', 'often', 'depressed', 'mopey', 'most', 'roles', 'However', 'very', 'good', 'career-defining', 'role', 'even', 'sexy', 'times', 'received', 'two', 'Emmy', 'nominations', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Comedy', 'win', 'category', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'crowded', 'supporting', 'cast', 'joined', 'Heylia', 'Tonye', 'Patano', 'Nancy', 'sassy', 'supplier', 'family', 'members', 'Vaneeta', 'Conrad', 'Finally', 'Kevin', 'Nealon', 'Doug', 'marijuana-crazy', 'CPA', 'who', 'Nancy', 'run', 'business', 'also', 'Agrestic', 'City', 'Council', 'Many', 'biggest', 'laughs', 'are', 'supplied', 'Heylia', 'people', 'who', 'appreciate', 'pot', 'humor', 'will', 'probably', 'also', 'Doug.During', 'first', 'season', 'Weeds', 'great', 'job', 'examining', 'hypocrisy', 'suburbia', 'Nancy', 'drug', 'dealing', 'balanced', 'nicely', 'plots', 'involving', 'Shane', 'school', 'problems', 'Celia', 'family', 'issues', 'so', 'forth', 'Unfortunately', 'mid-way', 'season', 'Nancy', 'brother-in-law', 'Andy', 'Justin', 'Kirk', 'Andy', 'juvenile', 'pot-smoking', 'responsibility-shirking', 'idiot', 'on-screen', 'far', 'too', 'often', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'particular', 'Doug', 'become', 'friends', 'plots', 'too', 'often', 'involve', 'being', 'stoned', 'irresponsible', 'very', 'reasons', 'avoided', 'Weeds', 'initially', 'However', 'overall', 'show', 'still', 'strong', 'unlikeable', 'characters']",Weeds: Season 1
