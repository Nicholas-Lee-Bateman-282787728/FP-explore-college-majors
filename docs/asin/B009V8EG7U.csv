1602492,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,B009V8EG7U,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[2, 2]","When considering 'Fritz the Cat', I will say that it is an equal opportunity offender - nearly any group of people can find find something here to feel insulted by.  That doesn't necessarily make this a throw-away film though.  An insult may or may not contain elements of the truth, but in 'Fritz's' case, I think one can be reasonably assured that it contained the perspective of the filmmakers during the final days of the 1960's.  That Robert Crumb, the creator of 'Fritz the Cat' hated Bakshi's film is neither here nor there - Crumb's work contains far more puerile and offensively insulting material than Bakshi's does.But the purpose of this review is not to comment on that feud - I'm only concerned with the movie itself.  There seems to be two predominant opinions about this movie - One, that it is a tasteless, rascist, waste of time with juvenile depictions of cartoon animals having sex (which it is), or Two, a drug filled romp and laugh fest about a cool cat who lives every day like it's his last (which it also is, sort of).  Both these extremes miss the point I took away from the film, which was the commentary on a period of time in America that was coming down from its self-induced drug highs and battling with the realities that the Pie-in-the-sky social revolution couldn't face.There is power in animation - an animated character can do and say things that a live person would be excoriated for.  For instance, when Fritz decides to hang out in Harlem, to soak up the African-American 'experience', Bakshi exposes Fritz's utter ignorance about their lives.  Priveliged Fritz mouths liberal platitudes while trying to insinuate himself in the graces of a character named Duke, who sees right through him but by a quirk of fate decides to take the cat under his wing anyway (literally - all African Americans are represented as crows in the film).  Bakshi focuses his satire on the naive Fritz - the cat is a tourist in a land he knows nothing about, and doesn't care to know anymore than the false impressions he's already acquired.  Thus, hanging out in Harlem, for Fritz, is nothing more than a literal and metaphorical joy ride.This is the essence of Fritz.  He bounces from one situation to another, convinced of his perceptiveness and eager for the next life experience.  Except his perceptiveness is non-existant, and he careens down a path that leads to some very destructive stuff.  The final chapters of 'Fritz' are chilling, one example of where the 'free society' that people dreamed of in the late 60's could end.And through it all, Fritz never learns a thing.  Take this movie as you will, as a heap of garbage or as a hilarious romp.  The DVD release would certainly benefit from a commentary by Bakshi (Check out the ""Wizards"" DVD for a commentary where he drops a few tidbits about 'Fritz'), but taken on its own, I thought it was a pointed statement about the foolishness and inherent potential danger of the social movements of the late 60's.

(He finally gets a clue just before blowing himself up as a tool for a group of pseudo-revolutionaries). I remember sharing my feelings with a friend of mine, how I loved the movie, but how I hated Fritz.""Are you trying to impose some kind of set of morals on Fritz the Cat, man?"" was his reply.Oh yeah. Back to Earth. It's a cartoon, so sit back, relax, and enjoy watching the college-boy nitwit follow his, er, passions around with his head in the clouds, getting himself and everyone else around him into real world, lethal trouble. Perfect reflection of American society at the time the film was made; half the population with their heads up their asses while the other half got their heads and asses blown off, at home and abroad.One thing I'll say about Bakshi, for all his zaniness, he takes violence seriously. There is a great deal of violence in his films, but, as funny as his films are, the violent scenes are almost never funny in the least. Violence in a Bakshi film is horrific, gruesome, sickening, and serious as a heart attack.This film features some wonderfully stabbing satirical statements made about America's cultural dirty linens, delivered in the way that only Ralph Bakshi can.I'm a big fan of Bakshi and I highly reccomend this one, along with ""Hey Good-Lookin"" and ""Street Fight,"" which is unquestionably my favorite.The sequels to Fritz the Cat were substandard crap, don't bother with them.You don't have to be high to enjoy Fritz the Cat...but it doesn't hurt.I've been waiting a loooong time for this to come out on DVD.Open up, you freebirds.",4,weird nasty fun,1124064000,"08 15, 2005",2005,1676,"['Let', 'get', 'one', 'thing', 'straight', 'Fritz', 'jerk', 'annoying', 'morally', 'reprehensible', 'way', 'finally', 'clue', 'just', 'blowing', 'up', 'tool', 'group', 'pseudo-revolutionaries', 'remember', 'sharing', 'feelings', 'friend', 'mine', 'how', 'loved', 'movie', 'how', 'hated', 'Fritz', 'Are', 'trying', 'impose', 'kind', 'set', 'morals', 'Fritz', 'Cat', 'man', 'was', 'reply.Oh', 'yeah', 'Back', 'Earth', 'cartoon', 'sit', 'back', 'relax', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'college-boy', 'nitwit', 'follow', 'er', 'passions', 'head', 'clouds', 'getting', 'everyone', 'else', 'real', 'world', 'lethal', 'trouble', 'Perfect', 'reflection', 'American', 'society', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'population', 'heads', 'up', 'asses', 'other', 'half', 'got', 'heads', 'asses', 'blown', 'off', 'home', 'abroad.One', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'say', 'Bakshi', 'zaniness', 'violence', 'seriously', 'great', 'deal', 'violence', 'films', 'as', 'funny', 'films', 'are', 'violent', 'scenes', 'are', 'almost', 'never', 'funny', 'least', 'Violence', 'Bakshi', 'film', 'horrific', 'gruesome', 'sickening', 'serious', 'heart', 'attack.This', 'film', 'wonderfully', 'stabbing', 'satirical', 'statements', 'made', 'America', 'cultural', 'dirty', 'linens', 'delivered', 'way', 'only', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Bakshi', 'highly', 'reccomend', 'one', 'Hey', 'Good-Lookin', 'Street', 'Fight', 'unquestionably', 'favorite.The', 'sequels', 'Fritz', 'Cat', 'were', 'substandard', 'crap', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'them.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'high', 'enjoy', 'Fritz', 'Cat', ""n't"", 'hurt.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'loooong', 'time', 'come', 'out', 'DVD.Open', 'up', 'freebirds']",N/A

1602497,AWI3PQ13KX0WE,B009V8EG7U,"Eric Noble ""Animation Keeper""","[0, 0]","""Fritz the Cat"", the very first X-rated animated feature, is a good, yet strange film that is not for everybody. There are reasons to watch it and to avoid it. I personally like it.The film is about the adventures of a young hip cat (literally a cat) through 1960's New York. It follows him from his pot-fueled bathtub orgy to his brief association with a group of sadistic revolutionaries.The film has many positive attributes. It is a hilarious, yet pitch-black, satire of the 1960s and all of its pretensions and social standards (though was film was made in the early 70s, but it's close enough). The first part of the movie satirizes the generation gap and free love (that's where the orgy comes in). Later, the film tackles the racial tensions of the era when fritz goes to harlem and basically starts the biggest riot east of the Mississippi. This leads to a funny cameo by a few famous cartoon characters from Bakshi's biggest animation competitor. The film has a gritty, urban atmosphere to it, contributed in no small part by Bakshi's use of actual street dialogue. There is a scene in the crow bar (blacks are represented as crows in this movie) where a couple of crows are discussing black revolution. That was actual dialogue recorded by Bakshi. The atmosphere is also benefited by the animation. While sloppy in parts, much of the film has plenty of great personality animation. The animation was done by some of the best animators of the Golden Age like former Disney/Warners animators like Dick Lundy and Rod Scribner. The best bit is a piece done by Jim Tyer, formerly of Terrytoons (Mighty Mouse, Heckle and Jeckle). It is the part where Fritz chases and ravages Big Bertha while doped up. Fritz burns with animal lust in Jim Tyer's hands. It's not Disney, but it's not meant to be. Lastly, the great soundtrack completes the urban ambiance. It has a plethora of great artists, such as Billie Holliday.Although there are many positive aspects, the movie also has a few downfalls. Many of the characters, while interesting initially, kind of fall flat after awhile. Fritz is a very unlikeable character in many respects. He likes to think of himself as a great philosopher in the Kerouac-Beat tradition, but he's a total poseur out to get laid. While these contrasts could make interesting character development, the story does not really correlate the two personas well. The storytelling is also a weak point. i don't know if this comes from the original comic by R. Crumb (who wasn't that great at storytelling himself), but often a character is left behind but comes back later with no explanations. This is not helped by Bakshi's use of surreal imagery that doesn't add to anything. A few instances click (like the correlation of Duke the crow's death and the game of pool), but most fall flat. Another weak point is sometimes the image on the screen don't match the music. This is true of the scene where the violent revolutionaries are about to rape a horse girl. There's a buildup in the music, but the images just stick with a group shot without any resolution. We know what happens, but there's no emotional release. Speaking of rape, there is an excess amount of violence. That might turn some people off.Overall, it's good film that will undoubtedly leave an impression on everybody, whether you love it or hate it.",4,Great Film Hasn't Lost Potency After Nearly Forty Years,1252281600,"09 7, 2009",2009,3343,"['Cat', 'very', 'first', 'X-rated', 'animated', 'feature', 'good', 'yet', 'strange', 'film', 'not', 'everybody', 'are', 'reasons', 'watch', 'avoid', 'personally', 'it.The', 'film', 'adventures', 'young', 'hip', 'cat', 'literally', 'cat', '1960', 'New', 'York', 'pot-fueled', 'bathtub', 'orgy', 'brief', 'association', 'group', 'sadistic', 'revolutionaries.The', 'film', 'many', 'positive', 'attributes', 'hilarious', 'yet', 'pitch-black', 'satire', '1960s', 'pretensions', 'social', 'standards', 'was', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'early', '70s', 'close', 'enough', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'generation', 'gap', 'free', 'love', 'where', 'orgy', 'Later', 'film', 'racial', 'tensions', 'era', 'when', 'fritz', 'harlem', 'basically', 'biggest', 'riot', 'east', 'Mississippi', 'funny', 'cameo', 'few', 'famous', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'Bakshi', 'biggest', 'animation', 'competitor', 'film', 'gritty', 'urban', 'atmosphere', 'contributed', 'small', 'part', 'Bakshi', 'use', 'actual', 'street', 'dialogue', 'scene', 'crow', 'bar', 'blacks', 'are', 'represented', 'crows', 'movie', 'where', 'couple', 'crows', 'are', 'discussing', 'black', 'revolution', 'was', 'actual', 'dialogue', 'recorded', 'Bakshi', 'atmosphere', 'also', 'benefited', 'animation', 'sloppy', 'parts', 'much', 'film', 'plenty', 'great', 'personality', 'animation', 'animation', 'was', 'done', 'best', 'animators', 'Golden', 'Age', 'former', 'Disney/Warners', 'animators', 'Dick', 'Lundy', 'Rod', 'Scribner', 'best', 'bit', 'piece', 'done', 'Jim', 'Tyer', 'formerly', 'Terrytoons', 'Mighty', 'Mouse', 'Heckle', 'Jeckle', 'part', 'where', 'Fritz', 'Big', 'Bertha', 'doped', 'up', 'Fritz', 'animal', 'lust', 'Jim', 'Tyer', 'hands', 'not', 'Disney', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'Lastly', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'urban', 'ambiance', 'plethora', 'great', 'artists', 'such', 'Billie', 'Holliday.Although', 'are', 'many', 'positive', 'aspects', 'movie', 'also', 'few', 'downfalls', 'Many', 'characters', 'interesting', 'initially', 'kind', 'fall', 'flat', 'awhile', 'Fritz', 'very', 'unlikeable', 'character', 'many', 'respects', 'think', 'great', 'philosopher', 'Kerouac-Beat', 'tradition', 'total', 'poseur', 'get', 'laid', 'contrasts', 'could', 'make', 'interesting', 'character', 'development', 'story', 'not', 'really', 'correlate', 'two', 'personas', 'well', 'storytelling', 'also', 'weak', 'point', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'original', 'comic', 'R.', 'Crumb', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'great', 'storytelling', 'often', 'character', 'left', 'back', 'later', 'explanations', 'not', 'helped', 'Bakshi', 'use', 'surreal', 'imagery', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'few', 'instances', 'click', 'correlation', 'Duke', 'crow', 'death', 'game', 'pool', 'most', 'fall', 'flat', 'weak', 'point', 'sometimes', 'image', 'screen', 'do', ""n't"", 'match', 'music', 'true', 'scene', 'where', 'violent', 'revolutionaries', 'are', 'rape', 'horse', 'girl', 'buildup', 'music', 'images', 'just', 'stick', 'group', 'shot', 'resolution', 'know', 'what', 'emotional', 'release', 'Speaking', 'rape', 'excess', 'amount', 'violence', 'might', 'turn', 'people', 'off.Overall', 'good', 'film', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'leave', 'impression', 'everybody', 'love', 'hate']",N/A

1602503,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B009V8EG7U,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 5]","Fritz the Cat is based on a character created by underground comic book artist Robert Crumb and is written and directed by Ralph Bakshi. When it was released in 1972, it generated controversy for being the first X-rated cartoon. Crumb disowned the film upon its release and having seen it, it's understandable why.Skip Hinnant gives some charming voice work as Fritz the Cat, a New York University student. Beginning in the 1960s, we meet Fritz while he eavesdrops on a few female cats talking about racial issues with a black crow. Soon, Fritz lures the girls to a nearby party and has a marijuana-fueled orgy in the bathtub. His orgy is soon interrupted by the cops (personified by pigs) and Fritz, now a fugitive, runs to a nearby synagogue.The film has racial, religious, cultural, and social stereotypes throughout. The cops are, obviously, stereotypes, but are the funniest thing about the movie. It's a social commentary that is certainly a good example of the radical/drug culture of the 1960s, but if it's a comedy you're looking for...Look elsewhere. It's humorous and amusing, but never laugh-out-loud funny.The cheap-looking 70s animation is unique and fascinating, while obviously nowhere near as impressive as animated movies of today.The biggest problem I had with ""Fritz the Cat"" was how tedious it can become. Already short at 78 minutes, I'm not sure Bakshi had enough ideas to fill up even this small running time. Some of the scenes in the film feel way too drawn out. For a film that is all about radical, revolutionary ideas...It doesn't manage to be anything revolutionary itself.I'm really surprised the film wasn't more controversial when released than it was. Calling parts of it racist wouldn't be a stretch.I would love to see ""Fritz the Cat"" remade, although an update with today's animation technology would definitely cause the film to lose some of its charm.Overall, ""Fritz"" is not a masterpiece in any sense of the word nor would I consider it required viewing. If it sounds interesting to you, it's worth seeing just to get the curiosity out of your system. Other than that, it'd be best for you to pass it up.C+",3,Nothing Revolutionary Here,1237766400,"03 23, 2009",2009,2146,"['Cat', 'based', 'character', 'created', 'underground', 'comic', 'book', 'artist', 'Robert', 'Crumb', 'written', 'directed', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'When', 'was', 'released', '1972', 'generated', 'controversy', 'being', 'first', 'X-rated', 'cartoon', 'Crumb', 'disowned', 'film', 'release', 'having', 'seen', 'understandable', 'why.Skip', 'Hinnant', 'charming', 'voice', 'work', 'Fritz', 'Cat', 'New', 'York', 'University', 'student', 'Beginning', '1960s', 'meet', 'Fritz', 'few', 'female', 'cats', 'talking', 'racial', 'issues', 'black', 'crow', 'Soon', 'Fritz', 'girls', 'nearby', 'party', 'marijuana-fueled', 'orgy', 'bathtub', 'orgy', 'soon', 'interrupted', 'cops', 'personified', 'pigs', 'Fritz', 'now', 'fugitive', 'nearby', 'synagogue.The', 'film', 'racial', 'religious', 'cultural', 'social', 'stereotypes', 'cops', 'are', 'obviously', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'funniest', 'thing', 'movie', 'social', 'commentary', 'certainly', 'good', 'example', 'radical/drug', 'culture', '1960s', 'comedy', ""'re"", 'looking', 'Look', 'elsewhere', 'humorous', 'amusing', 'never', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny.The', 'cheap-looking', '70s', 'animation', 'unique', 'fascinating', 'obviously', 'nowhere', 'as', 'impressive', 'animated', 'movies', 'today.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'had', 'Fritz', 'Cat', 'was', 'how', 'tedious', 'can', 'become', 'Already', 'short', '78', 'minutes', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Bakshi', 'had', 'enough', 'ideas', 'fill', 'up', 'even', 'small', 'running', 'time', 'scenes', 'film', 'feel', 'way', 'too', 'drawn', 'out', 'film', 'radical', 'revolutionary', 'ideas', ""n't"", 'manage', 'be', 'anything', 'revolutionary', 'itself.I', ""'m"", 'really', 'surprised', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'controversial', 'when', 'released', 'was', 'Calling', 'parts', 'racist', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'stretch.I', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'Fritz', 'Cat', 'remade', 'update', 'today', 'animation', 'technology', 'would', 'definitely', 'cause', 'film', 'lose', 'charm.Overall', 'Fritz', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'sense', 'word', 'would', 'consider', 'required', 'viewing', 'interesting', 'worth', 'seeing', 'just', 'get', 'curiosity', 'system', 'Other', ""'d"", 'be', 'best', 'pass', 'up.C+']",N/A
