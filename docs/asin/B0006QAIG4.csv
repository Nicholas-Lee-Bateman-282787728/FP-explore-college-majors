It's a great movie.  It's not just a film about a man who goes around impregnanting lesbians as the blurb on the back of the box kinda makes the film seem.  The film stars Anthony Mackie, a new actor who portrays Jack Armstrong.  At the beginning of the film it seems as if Jack has got it going on.  He is the vice-president of a pharmaceutical corporation, lives in a nice apartment, and is ivy league educated.  He is a brother that has it all together in every department--except in the romance department.  After his company goes into a downward spiral--in which he is fingered for the downfall, he lets an ex girlfriend convince him to donate his sperm to her and her girlfriend at $5,000 a piece.  When his assetts are frozen and he loses his job, he feels compell to continue to sell his sperm.  With his ex-girlfriend as his manager, she gets him $10,000 a pop.  This film is wonderful and thought provoking.  Jack gets into a bit of legal trouble and he starts to look to his religion, his family and other factors when it comes to whether or not he will continue to sell his manhood.  There were several things about this film that irked me a bit, but that is why I like Spike's films because there is always something that bothers me and makes me think.  When the women went into labor the scene was so over the top and they were all screaming and hollering.  However, I appreciate the details in the film.  For instance, when Jack was having sex with the various women, he made love to each one of them a different way.  He also developed a newfound friendship with his ex-girlfriend who left him for another woman years prior.  I recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a real thought provoking film.

872447,A18CA0GRHDVP8X,B0006QAIG4,Earl Hazell,"[0, 0]","Spike has always had this unusual way of showing he knows exactly what a well crafted structure for making movies is by his methodical way of totally abandoning the common practice.  This is to be expecetd of all great artists in any discipline.  Sometimes, however, this works okay but not greatly for the great director Spike Lee, like when he is going against form to say something important about gender and sexual relations, as in GIRL 6.  Sometimes it works exceptionally well, like in The 25th HOUR--a movie that, as a native New Yorker, poet and father made me cry like a woman at a wedding for an hour after it was over.  Sometimes this works so well he creates  masterpieces, like DO THE RIGHT THING and MALCOLM X.  And then sometimes you walk away wishing he had embraced the vehicular artistry that exists in common practice structure regardless of its predicatbility, like he did in MO' BETTER BLUES--or his latest, THE INSIDE MAN--because his willful departure from structure and traditional artistic form creates a wish in you that he hadn't...a wish strong enough to distract you from the movie in its entirety.And yet it doesn't distract you enough to stop watching.The protagonist of SHE HATE ME is, like in JUNGLE FEVER, an upwardly mobile Black Urban Professional Man working as a VP for a pharmeceutical conglomerate on the verge of producing an actual cure for AIDS.  Or so they'd like to believe.  The money to be made from such a revolutionary product gets in the eyes of the CEO (played by Woody Harrelson) and one of the higher ups (Ellen Barkin) to the point that they forget all ethics and morality and even dispense with the good science of the doctor who helped design the not yet ready for the market drug.  This leads to the protagonist stuck in a quagmire of corruption after the doctor commits suicide...which leads to him becoming the kind of whistle blower that could bring the entire company down.  The company heads naturally have no intention of allowing this, and proceed to destroy his career.This perfectly timed plot that the movie opens with is almost thrown away after the first twenty minutes, which is where the structural failures begin to become a distraction.  Our protagonist meets up with his ex-fiancee after his bank accounts are frozen and he has been fired.  She is a lesbian convert who cheated on him with a woman on the journey of discovering her true nature--which is actually more like bisexuality than lesbianism (a subject that is brought up in the movie but purposely never resolved).  She wants a baby for her and her female life partner...and she wants it to come from him.Thus begins the journey of our protagonist becoming essentially a patriarch/prostitute who impregnates almost twenty women, for five thousand dollars each.The messages about everything from the nature of human relationships, gender and sexuality to the value of human life in this modern technological age, to the truth about conspiracy and whistleblowers is stated in unusual ways.The structure of the narrative, again, is purposely disjunct.  An actor once told me that a screenplay is the closest thing to poetry in the literary arts; Spike's SHE HATE ME is more of a slam run by two or three street poets of New York City riffing simultaneously in that context than a single mini-Homerian epic or even Shakespearean sonnet.  And again, this is what makes the movie difficult to digest yet simultaneously too intriguing to stop watching.  Just when you think he did a bad job at conveying his message(s), you are left feeling like the messages you thought he was trying to convey are not actually the ones he was most concerned with-and therefore he may still be completely on point; you just haven't figured out what he's really saying yet.For this alone SHE HATE ME is worth seeing.

872448,AT6CZDCP4TRGA,B0006QAIG4,Eduarrdo Nietzsche,"[12, 21]","...up to now I've found something to like in every Spike Lee film I've ever seen, in fact I love his early work like ""She's Gotta Have It"" and ""Do The Right Thing.""But here it really seems like Lee set out to DELIBERATELY make the stupidest, clumsiest and totally irredeemable film imaginable.  Everything about it, from the first 10 minutes, just REEKS: atrociously directed actors stumbling through atrociously written dialogue, a cast of numbingly predictable stock characters, a story line that just rambles from one random unconnected schizoid digression after another and cannot decide if it's a sex farce or courtroom thriller or sociopolitical manifesto and packs about three wholesale suspensions of disbelief every five minutes---everything that could possibly go wrong does go wrong and never stops going wrong, in this absolute catastrophe of a movie.So I confess: the only thing that kept me from bailing out on this movie after the first ten minutes was my anticipation of watching Lee's typically yummy female cast (only Woody Allen can match his talent for always casting some of the hottest women on the planet) pay to get impregnated by Anthony Mackie.  On this score he only delivers once, during a flashback to the time that Mackie's character catches his fiancee in bed with another woman---the rest is pretty tame PG-13 stuff.  Compared to the sex scenes in his other films, even this normally strong segment of Lee's repertoire falls flat here.My theory: Spike Lee must've signed some ironclad contract to make X amount of films within X span of years which he cannot get out of, and ""She Hate Me"" is his spiteful revenge at the film studio.

872449,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0006QAIG4,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","SHE HATE ME by title and by the cover of this DVD suggests a comedy by the notorious Spike Lee, a comedy of the sexes with a lot of static in the background.  But as usual Spike Lee takes on issues and gives them a different slant, again establishing himself as a cinematic philosopher as well as a talented director, and the overall result is a thoughtful drama about contemporary issues that reflect historical precedents.Set against the corporate world decadent background, the main character is a bright young African American man Jack (Anthony Mackie) at the top of his powers in a company that is on the brink of releasing a vaccine that promises to wipe out AIDS.  In an opening bizarre conversation with a Dr. Schiller (David Bennett) he begins to gain insight that all is not well with his company.  When Dr. Schiller jumps from his 40th floor window to his death, everything begins to change.  Jack is confronted by his white female boss Margo (Ellen Barkin), blows the whistle on his company's practices, and is summarily dismissed, all of his financial assets being frozen.Jack ex-girlfriend Fatima (Kerry Washington), who has been living as a lesbian since their breakup four years ago, hears of Jack's financial problems and re-enters Jack's life with her lover Alex (Dania Ramirez) with the proposition that Jack be the sperm donor for each of the girls' desired pregnancies.  Confused but desperate Jack finally consents and impregnates both women.  Fatima (who still has strong feelings for Jack and is determined to help him through his crisis) becomes pregnant and simultaneously becomes an agent to bring fellow lesbians to Jack's apartment for impregnation for a fee of $10,000. each!  Though Jack has moral issues with this role, he successfully impregnates 19 women (including the wealthy daughter Simona (Monica Bellucci) of the mafia boss Don Angelo Bonasera (John Turturro) in the 'old-fashioned way'.Meanwhile Jack's whistle blowing on his company's corruption drives the new boss Powell (Woody Harelson) and Margo to bring charges that result in Jack's being imprisoned.  Jack's support comes most strongly from Fatima and Alex together with all of the successful mothers-to-be, but also reluctantly from his family (including his diabetic father Geronimo - Jim Brown). Ultimately Jack has his day in court where all of the issues collide in a way that brings the story to a sensitive conclusion.The aspects that make this an unclassifiable film are the comedic use of animation, the somewhat warped look at lesbian women who desire children, the 'bad white folks' who head Jack's company, the spears well-aimed at corporate greed and degeneracy, and the extraordinary tenderness with which Lee forms his lead characters.  But that is what makes Spike Lee's films work.  There are no (pardon the pun) 'black and white' explanations for the issues he confronts: everything is a shade of gray. If he becomes preachy on certain aspects, he remains just as human and tender on others.  The film is a bit overlong at 138 minutes and it is practically drowned in sound by the dyspeptic musical score by Terence Blanchard.  But in all the fine cast and thoughtful script make this a movie worth savoring.

The film's topography shows the reality that the universe is changing. Attitudes and politics are changing.Unfortunately, Mr. Lee had to tout the feminist and lesbian vote by not depicting why these women are using the ""role reversal.""  If this were an autobiography, I think that the audience would see that some, not all, of the women in the film have been victims of male torture.  In one scene, Fatima's live-in lover says, ""I don't even feel like a woman"" since she didn't get pregnant.  My question, then, is ""Is Fatima a male in their relationship?""  Also, an additional question is ""Why do these lesbian women have to identify roles in their relationships?""  Why is Fatima's lover cooking dinner for both of them, after she walks in the condo with a business suit (in one scene)?Finally, Jack is portrayed as a victim.  He is not.  Jack is a Wharton graduate who feels denigrated to consort to other forms of employment and/or career alternatives like: teaching, working at McDonald's, or playing nursemaid to his sick father. Therefore, he does not have to be a ""stallion"" sending his spermatoza into women who are paying him.  Furthermore, Jack doesn't have to feed the children that he is creating. He is not the victim of rape and furthermore, he signs a ""release of parental responsibility.""  This fact creates the stereotypical ""black stallion.""  Jack, an educated man, becomes an irresponsible prototype of the black male who does not support his progeny.  Here is where Spike shows that the black male stereoptype is alive.The movie is worth watching so that you THINK.  As ususal, Mr. Lee leaves you guessing.  He does not answer the questions for you.

872455,A3IY9HIAMJQ7HL,B0006QAIG4,Marcel Lee,"[0, 0]","A lot of, perhaps most, so-called lesbians are actually bisexual. A lot of, perhaps most, women who claim to be straight are too. Fatima's fianc&eacute; Jack; the vice president of a corporate firm; caught her in bed having sex with another woman. She claims it was her first time and that the reason she did it is because she ""had to find-out"" her sexual orientation, either unaware or unwilling to admit that the curiosity alone told her everything she needed to know. It's not who you have sex with that determines your sexual orientation, in other words, it's who you're sexually attracted to.So when Fatima's new girlfriend and several other ""lesbian"" women have sex with Jack; her now ex-fianc&eacute;; it's strictly business. They want babies and women can't give each other babies. And sperm banks are too unreliable and it's hard for women couples to adopt. That makes Jack the man of choice. After losing his job during a Watergate-like job scandal, he needs the money; ten-thousand dollars per woman, minus Fatima's ten-percent finder's fee. That's the deal and the hook of the plot. The fact that Fatima still has heteromantic feelings for him is supposed to be beside the point.If it all seems silly, that's because it is. The overall tone of this Spike Lee ""joint"" is that of a serious drama, as the orchestral score so often suggests, but the lesbian baby bits come across as some sort of comical hyperbole. That might be fine if the movie were just about that, but it rocks back and forth between that and Jack's unrelated job scandal, which lacks any real sense of suspense despite threatening to land him in prison for a long time. There's even a big courtroom scene near the end.

872456,AMUP8DYE7EAN2,B0006QAIG4,"mateo52 ""invisible man""","[0, 0]","I've always had a great deal of admiration for Spike Lee as a filmmaker even if I haven't always found his films enjoyable.  Over nearly three decades of direction, he has proven to be an enigma, willing to stretch and take risks in selection of subject matter, often bringing attention to issues related to ethnicity, social responsibility, cultural distinctiveness and self-reflexivity among others, in a direct periodically controversial manner. Conversely, his directorial style, originally acclaimed as inventive and edgy has fallen into predictability.  There are signature devices like kaleidoscopic shots, frame capture and repetition, or overhead perspective where immediately the viewer recognizes the film as a Spike Lee joint.While at first, I didn't find She Hate Me to be particularly successful in either the dramatic segments or attempts at comedic release as in both instances the scenes seemed over-worked, those factors did not make the movie unwatchable and may have been the result of familiarity with thematic paths Lee has examined so often in previous films. I believe the emphasis on lesbianism is a new hook - for Lee anyway - but the underlying message here that self-awareness is often amorphous and in far too many situations personal values are sublimated to capitalistic aspirations, these concepts are recurrent subjects in many of his films. In this outing the sub-plots, most of which were satirical treatments of conventional views, are multifaceted but so numerable that for some viewers the film may appear to lack cohesiveness. Lee also becomes heavy-handed with what is obviously personal commentary on some issues like corporate excesses and social responsibility but with those concepts under examination in the same space he uses to decry parochialism in society by presenting a range of stereotypical characterizations he risks confusing a portion of his audience and offending another.",3,Not everyone likes fusion jazz.,1247961600,"07 19, 2009",2009,1929,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'had', 'great', 'deal', 'admiration', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'filmmaker', 'even', 'have', ""n't"", 'always', 'found', 'films', 'enjoyable', 'nearly', 'three', 'decades', 'direction', 'proven', 'be', 'enigma', 'willing', 'stretch', 'take', 'risks', 'selection', 'subject', 'matter', 'often', 'bringing', 'attention', 'issues', 'related', 'ethnicity', 'social', 'responsibility', 'cultural', 'distinctiveness', 'self-reflexivity', 'others', 'direct', 'periodically', 'controversial', 'manner', 'Conversely', 'directorial', 'style', 'originally', 'acclaimed', 'inventive', 'edgy', 'fallen', 'predictability', 'are', 'signature', 'devices', 'kaleidoscopic', 'shots', 'frame', 'capture', 'repetition', 'overhead', 'perspective', 'where', 'immediately', 'viewer', 'film', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'joint.While', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'Hate', 'Me', 'be', 'particularly', 'successful', 'dramatic', 'segments', 'attempts', 'comedic', 'release', 'instances', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'over-worked', 'factors', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'movie', 'unwatchable', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'result', 'familiarity', 'thematic', 'paths', 'Lee', 'examined', 'so', 'often', 'previous', 'films', 'believe', 'emphasis', 'lesbianism', 'new', 'hook', 'Lee', 'anyway', 'underlying', 'message', 'here', 'self-awareness', 'often', 'amorphous', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'situations', 'personal', 'values', 'are', 'sublimated', 'capitalistic', 'aspirations', 'concepts', 'are', 'recurrent', 'subjects', 'many', 'films', 'outing', 'sub-plots', 'most', 'were', 'satirical', 'treatments', 'conventional', 'views', 'are', 'multifaceted', 'so', 'numerable', 'viewers', 'film', 'may', 'appear', 'lack', 'cohesiveness', 'Lee', 'also', 'heavy-handed', 'what', 'obviously', 'personal', 'commentary', 'issues', 'corporate', 'excesses', 'social', 'responsibility', 'concepts', 'examination', 'same', 'space', 'decry', 'parochialism', 'society', 'presenting', 'range', 'stereotypical', 'characterizations', 'confusing', 'portion', 'audience', 'offending']",N/A

Viola, a money making business is formed!The issue I take with the story, is that I didn't see how it transformed the main character. Where is the growth? How did he find himself? Donating goodies to women? Not good enough. How does doing that, demonstrate his growth as a character? It doesn't.Even the end of the movie, with him winding up in a three-way relationship with his ex and her girlfriend/partner. Where is the growth? Where are the lessons?I didn't get it.

872462,A2WELHE1RT3ELM,B0006QAIG4,Reggie L. Mattocks,"[1, 2]","Like everyone else, when I saw this movie on the shelf, I figured typical Spike Lee movie with a lot of comedy with dashes of seriousness added to provoke thought, which is usually a Lee trademark.  Eventhough a lot of the parts as far as Mackie's interaction with trying to impregnate lesbians, who were more than willing to pay him top dollar to do so, became almost too way over the top to even fathom, I think the point behind it was when a person's back is against the wall, after losing a job, getting his assets freezed by the government, having his name slandered and unable to gain employment because of trying to do the right thing, and basically being to the point where he was penniless, if faced with that choice, what would any of us do in that situation?  Sit around and mope, or look for the quick buck.  It's a problem we have as a society today that we tend to put more emphasis on a quick dollar ahead of morals.  And to me that was whole concept to this movie.  Whether a quick dollar is worth having at the expense of losing your dignity, self respect, and morals we were brought up to have.  Though, this clearly is not one of Lee's best films, and it has ""She's Got To Have It"" 2005 written all over it, the film still makes you question even some of the decisions we make in our daily lives.  I love the history lesson also injected into the film (anybody who's watched a Spike Lee movie knows there's usually one in his films) of the police officer who was basically responsible for whistleblowing and starting off the chain reaction of the Watergate scandal.  It was a nice mix of the past which coincided with Mackie's present of blowing the whistle on his company's unethical practices and his character was forced to face the same hardships and realities as the officer who blew the whistle on Watergate.  It's a lesson that it's a lot more painstaking in life sometimes to do what you feel is morally right.  I've seen enough of Spike Lee's films over the past almost 20 years now to know not to look at a film on the surface but to look at the message behind what he's presenting.  Overall, it's a good film with many, many terrific actors and actresses in it, and how Lee managed to differentiate all the different top notch artists, and give them their own unique characters to spotlight on, just shows his usual creative genius behind the camera.

872468,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0006QAIG4,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 6]","Whatever the film's real message or satire behind this messy collection of ideas may be, `She Hate Me' is definitely a Spike Lee film. There have been common threads that run through the works that Spike Lee had done in the past, and they are deeply related to racial consciousness. It is also true he has been trying to expand his perspectives and even when he shot films like `25th Hour' you will not miss the Spike Lee touch in there.In his `She Hate Me' you can find his unmistakable touches, for example, in the jazzy music, the (occasionally used) grainy images of 16 mm film, or frequent close-ups of the actors. You can also hear his 'voices' or messages, which are as honest and candid as the ones you heard in the 80s, but what he is trying to say remains unclear from the first to the end.Consider this. In `She Hate Me' you will meet a gentle businessman `Jack' (brilliant Anthony Mackie) working for a big pharmaceutical company, who comes to know that the data submitted to FDA were actually rigged. He becomes a `whistle blower' but in consequence he is fired.Then this story about corrupt business jumps to a totally unexpected stage. That is, `Jack' finds his former girlfriend waiting for him at home, who is in fact a lesbian. Knowing that Jack needs money, she offers a $10,000 deal to him, in order to have a baby - well, in fact two babies, one for her and another for her lover. Now I don't think I have to write how she gets what she wants except that there are some silly cartoon-like sequences which show how insemination occur.Some reviewers say this film, if flawed, would be at least food for thought. Certainly there are some parts that could be intelligent commentaries on such issues as sexuality and parentage, but the film completely fails to convince us of its logical and coherent views on our society. For instance, the film warns us of the danger of being a whistle blower. Fine, but in what way does it related to the story of a man sleeping with as many as 18 ladies (including Monica Bellucci)?But probably the biggest weakness of `She Hate Me' is its superficial descriptionf of women. See, for example, how all the `clients' of Jack (presumably lesbian) are depicted as if they are sexually aroused (and pleased) while in bed with Jack. For all his undeniable talent for tackling the social issues, Lee is not known for drawing convincing portraits of women, and I can say he has not changed much. I understand homosexuals and lesbians have their own problems, but I'm sure they would not even try to solve them in the way Lee shows unashamedly to make us laugh.Lee managed to gather an interesting list of supporting actors including Ellen Barkin, Jim Brown, Ossie Davis, Brian Dennehy, Woody Harrelson, Bai Ling, Lonette McKee, Q-Tip, Dania Ramirez, and John Turturro. Among them, John Turturro shows again his brilliant performance which makes the flat character he plays a truly flesh-and-blood person. Surely `She Hate Me' is worth watching for the skills of the cast and crew involved in it, but they could have been used in much more efficient way with more coherent story than they are now.",2,Spike Lee Disjointed: Too Many Ideas in One Film,1164153600,"11 22, 2006",2006,3141,"['film', 'real', 'message', 'satire', 'messy', 'collection', 'ideas', 'may', 'be', 'Hate', 'Me', 'definitely', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'common', 'threads', 'run', 'works', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'had', 'done', 'past', 'are', 'deeply', 'related', 'racial', 'consciousness', 'also', 'true', 'been', 'trying', 'expand', 'perspectives', 'even', 'when', 'shot', 'films', '25th', 'Hour', 'will', 'not', 'miss', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'touch', 'there.In', 'Hate', 'Me', 'can', 'find', 'unmistakable', 'touches', 'example', 'jazzy', 'music', 'occasionally', 'used', 'grainy', 'images', '16', 'mm', 'film', 'frequent', 'close-ups', 'actors', 'can', 'also', 'hear', ""'voices"", 'messages', 'are', 'honest', 'candid', 'ones', 'heard', '80s', 'what', 'trying', 'say', 'remains', 'unclear', 'first', 'end.Consider', 'Hate', 'Me', 'will', 'meet', 'gentle', 'businessman', 'Jack', 'brilliant', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'working', 'big', 'pharmaceutical', 'company', 'who', 'know', 'data', 'submitted', 'FDA', 'were', 'actually', 'rigged', 'whistle', 'blower', 'consequence', 'fired.Then', 'story', 'corrupt', 'business', 'jumps', 'totally', 'unexpected', 'stage', 'Jack', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'waiting', 'home', 'who', 'fact', 'lesbian', 'Knowing', 'Jack', 'money', '10,000', 'deal', 'order', 'have', 'baby', 'well', 'fact', 'two', 'babies', 'one', 'lover', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', 'write', 'how', 'what', 'are', 'silly', 'cartoon-like', 'sequences', 'show', 'how', 'insemination', 'occur.Some', 'reviewers', 'say', 'film', 'flawed', 'would', 'be', 'least', 'food', 'thought', 'Certainly', 'are', 'parts', 'could', 'be', 'intelligent', 'commentaries', 'such', 'issues', 'sexuality', 'parentage', 'film', 'completely', 'convince', 'logical', 'coherent', 'views', 'society', 'instance', 'film', 'danger', 'being', 'whistle', 'blower', 'Fine', 'what', 'way', 'related', 'story', 'man', 'sleeping', 'as', 'many', '18', 'ladies', 'including', 'Monica', 'Bellucci', 'probably', 'biggest', 'weakness', 'Hate', 'Me', 'superficial', 'descriptionf', 'women', 'See', 'example', 'how', 'clients', 'Jack', 'presumably', 'lesbian', 'are', 'depicted', 'are', 'sexually', 'aroused', 'pleased', 'bed', 'Jack', 'undeniable', 'talent', 'tackling', 'social', 'issues', 'Lee', 'not', 'known', 'drawing', 'convincing', 'portraits', 'women', 'can', 'say', 'not', 'changed', 'much', 'understand', 'homosexuals', 'lesbians', 'have', 'own', 'problems', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'not', 'even', 'try', 'solve', 'way', 'Lee', 'unashamedly', 'make', 'laugh.Lee', 'managed', 'gather', 'interesting', 'list', 'supporting', 'actors', 'including', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'Jim', 'Brown', 'Ossie', 'Davis', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Bai', 'Ling', 'Lonette', 'McKee', 'Q-Tip', 'Dania', 'Ramirez', 'John', 'Turturro', 'John', 'Turturro', 'again', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'flat', 'character', 'truly', 'flesh-and-blood', 'person', 'Surely', 'Hate', 'Me', 'worth', 'watching', 'skills', 'cast', 'crew', 'involved', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'much', 'more', 'efficient', 'way', 'more', 'coherent', 'story', 'are', 'now']",N/A
872469,A2W7GQG04QCEVT,B0006QAIG4,Wendell,"[4, 5]","I'll give this three stars, but that's a disappointed three stars. I've been a Spike Lee fan since She's Gotta Have It. Used to be that I'd get out to see each of his films in the cinema right when it came out. That sort of enthusiasm has waned, however, and this film is an example of why.Spike has done some classics, like She's Gotta Have It, Do the Right Thing, Jungle Fever, X. And he's made some strong recent movies, like Summer of Sam and The 25th Hour. But he's also made some stinkers, like Crooklyn and Bamboozled. She Hate Me is a lot like those lesser films. Whatever point the director is trying to make takes over and moves his characters around like they were stick figures - even if they're doing their best with their roles. Sometimes this works, but I'm not sure that in this case Spike has anything particularly interesting to say about either big business or lesbian motherhood or black male physical objectification...I can't disregard him entirely. At moments this is thought provoking, but not often enough. It's tiring. Spike often goes on to long in his films, even in ones that I like. But when he goes on and on in a film that's not his best it really starts to get wearing. His cameo roles help inject some energy into it, but they don't hold the whole thing together. Anthony Mackie is a promising actor, but far too often in this he seems to doing a Will Smith imitation, especially when he gets upset.Anyway, not one of Mr. Lee's best. I wish, actually, that he'd branch out and do something outside his New York comfort zone. He was ambitious early in his career, but to stay ambitious he needs to branch out and challenge himself again. Maybe something historical, something with an international flavor, just something different!",3,Disappointing,1138492800,"01 29, 2006",2006,1764,"[""'ll"", 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'disappointed', 'three', 'stars', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'fan', 'Got', 'ta', 'Have', 'Used', 'be', ""'d"", 'get', 'out', 'see', 'films', 'cinema', 'right', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'sort', 'enthusiasm', 'waned', 'however', 'film', 'example', 'why.Spike', 'done', 'classics', 'Got', 'ta', 'Have', 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'X', 'made', 'strong', 'recent', 'movies', 'Summer', 'Sam', '25th', 'Hour', 'also', 'made', 'stinkers', 'Crooklyn', 'Bamboozled', 'Hate', 'Me', 'lot', 'lesser', 'films', 'point', 'director', 'trying', 'make', 'characters', 'were', 'stick', 'figures', 'even', ""'re"", 'doing', 'best', 'roles', 'Sometimes', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'case', 'Spike', 'anything', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'say', 'big', 'business', 'lesbian', 'motherhood', 'black', 'male', 'physical', 'objectification', 'ca', ""n't"", 'disregard', 'entirely', 'moments', 'thought', 'provoking', 'not', 'often', 'enough', 'tiring', 'Spike', 'often', 'long', 'films', 'even', 'ones', 'like', 'when', 'film', 'not', 'best', 'really', 'get', 'wearing', 'cameo', 'roles', 'help', 'inject', 'energy', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'whole', 'thing', 'together', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'promising', 'actor', 'far', 'too', 'often', 'doing', 'Will', 'Smith', 'imitation', 'especially', 'when', 'upset.Anyway', 'not', 'one', 'Mr.', 'Lee', 'best', 'wish', 'actually', ""'d"", 'branch', 'out', 'do', 'something', 'New', 'York', 'comfort', 'zone', 'was', 'ambitious', 'early', 'career', 'stay', 'ambitious', 'branch', 'out', 'challenge', 'again', 'Maybe', 'something', 'historical', 'something', 'international', 'flavor', 'just', 'something', 'different']",N/A

A weird offensive [...] unbelievable movie about an upper class Black businessman who is somehow forced through circumstance to sell his sperm to upper class ethnic/mostly Black lesbians who pay $10,000 a pop.  REALLY??????  It was so DUMB.  It was [...]- the sex scenes seemed to be for the male gaze and the lipstick lesbians all seemed to enjoy the mighty powerful expensive magical penis.  I didn't get it at all.  Also, there is this side story about the male lead being discriminated against in the workplace by The Man and evil corrupt Big Business preventing a cure for AIDs.  I'M NOT KIDDING.  This movie is ridiculous. An embarassment.  What is the message?  What is the purpose?  Who was the target audience?  What exactly was supposed to be entertaining?  A tawdry mess of a story.  Devoid of any soul.  If there was a moral or lesson, it was lost because the main character and all the other characters were so hopelessly flawed and unattractive- whenever they stopped screwing around to pontificate, I just didn't care.  And most of what they said just didn't make sense anyway.  I love you Spike but this film is horrible. Spike Lee's films usually have depth and ""authentic""/realistic characters BUT NOT THIS TIME.  It was almost like Spike knew it because everybody was weirdly ""fake"" pretty/glamorous looking. All style, NO substance.
