Estes,"[2, 2]","Taking an altogether different route than that of itspredecessor, ""Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II"" introduces a supernatural twist to the ""Prom Night"" franchise. In the film, hot-to-trot hussy, Mary Lou, gets her comeuppance when a jilted boyfriend accidentally sets her ablaze during her crowning as Prom Queen. Thirty years later, she returns to her old stomping grounds to possess a new Prom Queen hopeful and to hassle her old boyfriend, played by Michael Ironside, who just so happens to have grown up to be the principal of their high school.More ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" meets ""Carrie"" than ""Halloween"" or ""Friday The 13th,"" ""Prom Night II"" is a quirky but entertaining sequel. The death scenes are much more imaginative than in the first film, in spite of obvious heavy editing and some poorly-achieved yet ambitious visual effects. Michael Ironside rolls through the film straight-faced almost as if he can't wait to cash that paycheck. It's left up to the teens, then, to carry the film. Unfortunately they all appear to be in their mid-20s and, especially in the case of the main character, require much stretching of the imagination to fit the part.There's some undeniable weirdness at hand (especially concerning two gals in a shower) but the film succeeds at creating its own atmosphere independently of the first film. There are some issues with originality at times, but the film is never boring and doesn't quite turn out the way you expect it to. Also, the `50s nostalgia is a nice touch and helps set the film aside from other horror sequels in the `80s.  Overall, ""Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II"" is an entertaining if not odd little sequel that will entertain those who love their `80s cheese dished up with a bit of the strange.",3,Prom Night on Elm Street,1295827200,"01 24, 2011",2011,1751,"['Taking', 'altogether', 'different', 'route', 'itspredecessor', 'Hello', 'Mary', 'Lou', 'Prom', 'Night', 'II', 'supernatural', 'twist', 'Prom', 'Night', 'franchise', 'film', 'hot-to-trot', 'hussy', 'Mary', 'Lou', 'comeuppance', 'when', 'jilted', 'boyfriend', 'accidentally', 'ablaze', 'crowning', 'Prom', 'Queen', 'Thirty', 'years', 'later', 'old', 'stomping', 'grounds', 'possess', 'new', 'Prom', 'Queen', 'hopeful', 'hassle', 'old', 'boyfriend', 'played', 'Michael', 'Ironside', 'who', 'just', 'so', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'be', 'principal', 'high', 'school.More', 'A', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'Carrie', 'Halloween', 'Friday', '13th', 'Prom', 'Night', 'II', 'quirky', 'entertaining', 'sequel', 'death', 'scenes', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'imaginative', 'first', 'film', 'spite', 'obvious', 'heavy', 'editing', 'poorly-achieved', 'yet', 'ambitious', 'visual', 'effects', 'Michael', 'Ironside', 'film', 'straight-faced', 'almost', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'cash', 'paycheck', 'left', 'up', 'teens', 'then', 'carry', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'appear', 'be', 'mid-20s', 'especially', 'case', 'main', 'character', 'require', 'much', 'stretching', 'imagination', 'fit', 'part.There', 'undeniable', 'weirdness', 'hand', 'especially', 'concerning', 'two', 'gals', 'shower', 'film', 'creating', 'own', 'atmosphere', 'independently', 'first', 'film', 'are', 'issues', 'originality', 'times', 'film', 'never', 'boring', ""n't"", 'quite', 'turn', 'out', 'way', 'expect', 'Also', '50s', 'nostalgia', 'nice', 'touch', 'set', 'film', 'aside', 'other', 'horror', 'sequels', '80s', 'Overall', 'Hello', 'Mary', 'Lou', 'Prom', 'Night', 'II', 'entertaining', 'not', 'odd', 'little', 'sequel', 'will', 'entertain', 'who', 'love', '80s', 'cheese', 'dished', 'up', 'bit', 'strange']",N/A
916504,A3STFVPM8NHJ7B,B0009XTYQY,A. Pierre,"[1, 1]","Hello Mary Lou is a classic rock song originally sung by Ricky Nelson and covered by such classic bands as Queen, CCR, and Led Zeppelin. I love the song and it's not the reason why I bought this dvd. I saw a very, very brief clip of this film over ten years ago and i've always wanted to get it once I learned it was out on dvd.Mary Lou confesses to her priest that she likes sex and has done alot of guys in her school and craves her name in the confessional saying call for a good time. We cut to prom and she went with her current boyfriend but he is told they broke up. He denies it and catches her cheating on him, apparently the only reason why she dates him is because he treats her right and his father is rich. He accidentally sets Mary Lou on fire and everyone stares, weren't there any fire extinguishers back then? We cut to thirty years later and the boyfriend is the current principal of the school. Mary Lou comes back, enters the body of a girl, and wreaks havoc on peopke that did her wrong. The movie is not really gory and there is some cheap looking effects. The end of the movie was a typical ending to a horror film, leaving room for the next part.Overall, I enjoyed this movie even though the story was not always clear or maybe I didnt pay to much attention to it. I don't understand why they could not use the song Hello Mary Lou in the film.

Burned alive in front of the entire senior class, Mary Lou stares out at them w/ eyes full of hate. Fast-forward 30 years, and it's prom season again. This time, Mary Lou will finally have her vengeance. PROM NIGHT 2 is one of those movies I put off watching for years, figuring it would stink. I also wanted Jamie Lee Curtis to be in it (yes, I love her). Well, I just watched it and must say that it stands on it's own as an 80s classic.

Another memorable scene involving a rocking horse also looms, and this is a seriously cool film. The effects department keeps things exactly as they want them, which is average for a horror but in a style all of its own. Editing is just right and the acting always underplayed. Wendy Lyon plays a high school girl who is haunted by the ghost of Mary Lou which occupies the costume closet underneath the Great Hall. There are a lot of bad-tempered jealous characters in this movie, who are fuelled by an overdose of Heineken into unspeakable violence, not rivers of blood though because this is a very controlled SFX team. Locations are various, it's not just the school, and visually there is more than just a touch of the original Omen film.

916510,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B0009XTYQY,Dave. K,"[4, 6]","Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II is a sequel by name only; the only connection between this and the first Prom Night is the high school Hamilton High. Other than that this is a stand-alone movie with nothing from the original carrying over. I suppose that's a good thing; the original Prom Night wasn't the worst movie I've seen, but it's not very good either. The final 30-minutes were fairly decent, but not enough to really salvage it. Prom Night II on the other hand is a far better movie, but not without its fair share of flaws.There might be more going against Prom Night II rather than for it; there is a low body count, very little in the way of the red stuff, and very little suspense and tension. The basic premise of Prom Night II is a little bit of Carrie, A Nightmare on Elm Street and The Exorcist. And it also rips off, or you can say homage if you like to other horror movies of the 70s and 80s. But yet despite all these flaws there is just something so much fun about Prom Night II. Despite all those flaws it's damn entertaining.Writer Ron Oliver delivers the basic script for this kind of movie and borrows elements from other films, but he manages to work them in well and they don't feel out of place. Bottom line is the script won't win any awards, but it works out rather well. It's an entertaining script. It's not bad and it's not good, but again entertaining. Ron Oliver may not go down as one of the horror genres better writers, but his script mostly gets the job done.Director Bruce Pittman does a fairly good job at keeping the pace moving along nicely, there are a few spots where the pacing does lag, but overall there aren't too many slow moments due to the cheese factor. Most of the deaths are in the final 30-minutes or so, and that does hurt a little bit, but again Bruce Pittman keeps the pace mostly moving and with all the cheesy moments prior you won't lose interest. Prom Night II borderlines seriousness and camp, which was the point; though there are a couple of scenes I wasn't sure if they were meant to be serious or campy and that is the major flaw with the directing. There are certain scenes you know were meant to be campy, but like I said there were a couple that I wasn't quite sure.Prom Night II could have used a little bit of editing though like I said there are moments where the pace might lag a bit, but the cheese factor helps it from becoming boring. Prom Night II runs at about 97-minutes and could have maybe been edited down to the 90-minute mark, but the movie doesn't get too boring, but a little bit of editing could have greatly helped the pace.Prom Night II isn't without some bizarre moments one of them being when Vicki played by Wendy Lyon is possessed by Mary Lou she begins to make out with her father played by Wendell Smith. The creepy thing is the father was sort of into it. In fairness Vicki was possessed, but the father wasn't; gotta love movies with the incest theme.The cast was pretty good as well; Lisa Schrage as Mary Lou Maloney was excellent despite her limited screen time; Most of the time Mary Lou is either doing a haunting and we don't see her or possesses the body of Vicki. Wendy Lyon is highly likeable as the heroine and when possessed by Mary Lou she's really fun as the villain. Michael Ironside also stars and delivers a mostly entertaining performance. The rest of the cast play their roles they way they were meant to. Like I stated before Prom Night II borderlines seriousness and camp and the performances fit the movie.Overall despite the flaws Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II is an effective movie. While the suspense and tension does lack it's very entertaining in a way only an 80s horror flick can be. Though at least there is some full frontal nudity from Wendy Lyon. You rarely see that in movies these days due to the PC police. For a low budget the F/X weren't too bad. After this the Mary Lou plot would continue in Prom Night III and the 4th would go off in a different direction, but go back to the slasher elements of the first one. Of all the Prom Night flicks this is really the only one worth watching. Despite the flaws it manages to entertain and when all is said and done isn't that all that matters?",4,"Flawed, but fun",1207353600,"04 5, 2008",2008,4220,"['Hello', 'Mary', 'Lou', 'Prom', 'Night', 'II', 'sequel', 'name', 'only', 'only', 'connection', 'first', 'Prom', 'Night', 'high', 'school', 'Hamilton', 'High', 'Other', 'stand-alone', 'movie', 'nothing', 'original', 'carrying', 'suppose', 'good', 'thing', 'original', 'Prom', 'Night', 'was', ""n't"", 'worst', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'either', 'final', '30-minutes', 'were', 'fairly', 'decent', 'not', 'enough', 'really', 'salvage', 'Prom', 'Night', 'II', 'other', 'hand', 'far', 'better', 'movie', 'not', 'fair', 'share', 'flaws.There', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'going', 'Prom', 'Night', 'II', 'rather', 'low', 'body', 'count', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'red', 'stuff', 'very', 'little', 'suspense', 'tension', 'basic', 'premise', 'Prom', 'Night', 'II', 'little', 'bit', 'Carrie', 'A', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'Exorcist', 'also', 'off', 'can', 'say', 'homage', 'like', 'other', 'horror', 'movies', '70s', '80s', 'yet', 'flaws', 'just', 'something', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'Prom', 'Night', 'II', 'flaws', 'damn', 'entertaining.Writer', 'Ron', 'Oliver', 'basic', 'script', 'kind', 'movie', 'elements', 'other', 'films', 'work', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'place', 'Bottom', 'line', 'script', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'awards', 'out', 'rather', 'well', 'entertaining', 'script', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'good', 'again', 'entertaining', 'Ron', 'Oliver', 'may', 'not', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'one', 'horror', 'better', 'writers', 'script', 'mostly', 'job', 'done.Director', 'Bruce', 'Pittman', 'fairly', 'good', 'job', 'keeping', 'pace', 'moving', 'along', 'nicely', 'are', 'few', 'spots', 'where', 'pacing', 'lag', 'overall', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'many', 'slow', 'moments', 'due', 'cheese', 'factor', 'Most', 'deaths', 'are', 'final', '30-minutes', 'so', 'hurt', 'little', 'bit', 'again', 'Bruce', 'Pittman', 'pace', 'mostly', 'moving', 'cheesy', 'moments', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lose', 'interest', 'Prom', 'Night', 'II', 'seriousness', 'camp', 'was', 'point', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'were', 'meant', 'be', 'serious', 'campy', 'major', 'flaw', 'directing', 'are', 'certain', 'scenes', 'know', 'were', 'meant', 'be', 'campy', 'said', 'were', 'couple', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure.Prom', 'Night', 'II', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'little', 'bit', 'editing', 'said', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'pace', 'might', 'lag', 'bit', 'cheese', 'factor', 'becoming', 'boring', 'Prom', 'Night', 'II', '97-minutes', 'could', 'have', 'maybe', 'been', 'edited', 'down', '90-minute', 'mark', 'movie', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'boring', 'little', 'bit', 'editing', 'could', 'have', 'greatly', 'helped', 'pace.Prom', 'Night', 'II', ""n't"", 'bizarre', 'moments', 'one', 'being', 'when', 'Vicki', 'played', 'Wendy', 'Lyon', 'possessed', 'Mary', 'Lou', 'make', 'out', 'father', 'played', 'Wendell', 'Smith', 'creepy', 'thing', 'father', 'was', 'sort', 'fairness', 'Vicki', 'was', 'possessed', 'father', 'was', ""n't"", 'got', 'ta', 'love', 'movies', 'incest', 'theme.The', 'cast', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'well', 'Lisa', 'Schrage', 'Mary', 'Lou', 'Maloney', 'was', 'excellent', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'Most', 'time', 'Mary', 'Lou', 'either', 'doing', 'haunting', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'body', 'Vicki', 'Wendy', 'Lyon', 'highly', 'likeable', 'heroine', 'when', 'possessed', 'Mary', 'Lou', 'really', 'fun', 'villain', 'Michael', 'Ironside', 'also', 'mostly', 'entertaining', 'performance', 'rest', 'cast', 'play', 'roles', 'way', 'were', 'meant', 'stated', 'Prom', 'Night', 'II', 'seriousness', 'camp', 'performances', 'fit', 'movie.Overall', 'flaws', 'Hello', 'Mary', 'Lou', 'Prom', 'Night', 'II', 'effective', 'movie', 'suspense', 'tension', 'lack', 'very', 'entertaining', 'way', 'only', '80s', 'horror', 'flick', 'can', 'be', 'Though', 'least', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'Wendy', 'Lyon', 'rarely', 'see', 'movies', 'days', 'due', 'PC', 'police', 'low', 'budget', 'F/X', 'were', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'Mary', 'Lou', 'plot', 'would', 'continue', 'Prom', 'Night', 'III', '4th', 'would', 'go', 'off', 'different', 'direction', 'go', 'back', 'slasher', 'elements', 'first', 'one', 'Prom', 'Night', 'flicks', 'really', 'only', 'one', 'worth', 'watching', 'flaws', 'entertain', 'when', 'said', 'done', ""n't"", 'matters']",N/A

916514,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,B0009XTYQY,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[1, 1]","Although completely unrelated (not such a bad thing) to the original ""Prom Night"", ""Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night 2"" is an entertainingly dark movie that is rather low on actual horror.  The name of this movie itself indicates that this is not an all-time great horror movie, nor does it try to be, but for people serious about rounding out their horror movie collection, I think this review is helpful.  It should be noted that this sequel is better than the original, but that is faint praise.  Mary Lou was the prom queen during the 1950s, but she was a very bad girl, and when a prank goes bad, a la ""Carrie"", a tragedy results.Trying to separate itself from the original slasher, the sequel tries its hand at spiritual possession.  Overall, the possession scenes are rather dull, and there is virtually nothing scary about them.  Interestingly enough, ""Prom Night 2"" takes itself seriously for the most part as a horror movie, and this is partly what makes it fun, even if it's not scary.  Give it credit for that much.The acting is pretty good in ""Prom Night 2"", especially Michael Ironside.  The movie is executed pretty well, and the movie reaches its maximum potential.  On one level, ""Prom Night 2"" succeeds at being an entertaining movie with a dark side that actually takes itself seriously (for the most part) as a horror movie, but falls short in the scary department; and this is why ""Prom Night 2"" gets a decent rating of 2.25 STARS.  Therefore, if you're looking for an 80s movie that is in the mold of a horror movie, but more fun than scary, this could be your thing.

However I did not like any of the other Prom Night movies, except for this one, and maybe the 3rd one.As said, it's not a direct sequel, usually when horror movies are a success and they use the name to make another one in hopes the name alone can sell it, they usually get bashed by reviews and dismissed as cheap B-grade movies.Hello Mary-Lou is not that case. This movie is one people can truly say it's a sequel better then the original.The movie is about a woman named Mary Lou who is a tramp. Her boyfriend she goes to the prom with becomes very unhappy when he finds she will not do it with him, but he finds her going all the way with someone else backstage of the prom.Mary-Lou falls victim to a death that pays homage to ""Carrie"". She is burned in a fire and dies. Years later she returns to the school and possesses a young girl to seek revenge on those who killed her, and to finally enjoy her prom queen status, all while the typical things like people finding out and running around after her trying to stop it all.If anyone tells you this movie is a rip off of Carrie and a few other horror movies, they need to know that, this movie is not a rip off. It was paying homage to classic horror films. It was a collection of different horror flicks rolled into one for this story.Looking at it now, it's not the worlds greatest horror movie, but it's cool, it's funny and very enjoyable. Tho I first remember coming home one day when I was very young and my older brother was watching this, and the locker room scene scared the hell out of me as a kid, which is why I wanted to see it again a few years back ... and second time around, it was a great movie, and fun.There is combination available on DVD for Prom Night 2 & 3.

What fate. The movie jumps ahead thirty years, to show us that her prom date Bill Nordham is a principle and another man who had the hots for Marylou is the past has now become a priest of all things. A trunk in the school is opened, unleashing the rebellious spirit of Marylou. She slowly takes over the body of a young and uptight woman, Vicki, before another prom night and crown rolls around. Along the way she gets her taste of revenge by killing others just for the heck of it.The plot, of course, isn't the point. Body count and fun times are. The acting isn't superb but it's passable and many of the characters have an undeniable sort of charm about them.The film is obviously low budget but the plot works to accomplish what it set out to do: be a perfect popcorn movie that screams the title ""guilty pleasure."" Something about this film is addictive. Because, while the events are, well...basically stupid, they remained interesting.The deaths weren't even that good by slasher standards, unless you count the great ""locker squish"", but that's not what won me over. There was a great fun chemistry going down all the way through and I left this one feeling about as chipper as a girl recently asked to the prom.On a more deeper level, Vicki is in a way more the main character here. You have a girl basically buried beneath the disapproving face of her mother, the strictness of their religion, and trying to be the popular girl in school. She gets ridiculed by some of her peers without classifying as a nerd (although to me her boyfriend may as well be wearing triple thick glasses and spouting pocket protectors), and her mother is about as scary as the spirit of Mary Lou herself. After being drawn to the trunk and research on the past prom queen who died, she gets more than she bargained for but, through Mary Lou's possession, also finally stands up to her bitchy mother, has a near lesbian scene, becomes more friendly with her boyfriend (my guess is they never did much beforehand), and lets her stand up more to her enemies. While this is all accomplished in ""horror fun"" and not in the best way to achieve the end results, maybe there's a message somewhere in here?Not too much stands out on the acting, although Lisa Schrage as Mary Lou seems made for the part. Vicki (Wendy Lyon) had this look about her that fit, and her acting was stiff but blended in somehow. I remember seeing this years back and wondering how she did her hair in a particular scene. *ends strange side note* We have other good actors, such as Michael Ironside, but all of this are completely off. Whether it's intentional or not, it fits into the general theme of this movie.Of course there are a multitude of plot holes. I find it hard to believe the man who accidently killed her at the prom would then go on to become the principal there, for instance. But these things can always be overlooked when it comes to offerings like Prom Night 2.While this B movie may not be the best of the lot, it still can stand proud against some of the stinkers out there. The script isn't so foul it gives only migraines, the acting isn't so low it's reduced to high school play levels, and the humor in it is actually funny in a cute, morbid way.Don't rent it expected a sequel to the original prom night, or something classy - rent it expecting pure and simple old school slasher fun, and that's what you'll get.",4,Campy,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,3559,"['Marylou', 'Maloney', 'Lisa', 'Schrage', 'beautiful', 'popular', 'generically', 'bitchy', 'girl', 'who', 'up', 'dying', 'horrible', 'death', 'being', 'nominated', 'prom', 'queen', '1957', 'What', 'fate', 'movie', 'ahead', 'thirty', 'years', 'show', 'prom', 'date', 'Bill', 'Nordham', 'principle', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'hots', 'Marylou', 'past', 'now', 'become', 'priest', 'things', 'trunk', 'school', 'opened', 'unleashing', 'rebellious', 'spirit', 'Marylou', 'slowly', 'body', 'young', 'uptight', 'woman', 'Vicki', 'prom', 'night', 'crown', 'rolls', 'way', 'taste', 'revenge', 'killing', 'others', 'just', 'heck', 'it.The', 'plot', 'course', ""n't"", 'point', 'Body', 'count', 'fun', 'times', 'are', 'acting', ""n't"", 'superb', 'passable', 'many', 'characters', 'have', 'undeniable', 'sort', 'charm', 'them.The', 'film', 'obviously', 'low', 'budget', 'plot', 'accomplish', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'be', 'perfect', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'title', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'Something', 'film', 'addictive', 'events', 'are', 'well', 'basically', 'stupid', 'remained', 'interesting.The', 'deaths', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'good', 'slasher', 'standards', 'count', 'great', 'locker', 'squish', 'not', 'what', 'won', 'over', 'was', 'great', 'fun', 'chemistry', 'going', 'way', 'left', 'one', 'feeling', 'as', 'chipper', 'girl', 'recently', 'asked', 'prom.On', 'more', 'deeper', 'level', 'Vicki', 'way', 'more', 'main', 'character', 'here', 'have', 'girl', 'basically', 'buried', 'disapproving', 'face', 'mother', 'strictness', 'religion', 'trying', 'be', 'popular', 'girl', 'school', 'ridiculed', 'peers', 'classifying', 'nerd', 'boyfriend', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'wearing', 'triple', 'thick', 'glasses', 'spouting', 'pocket', 'protectors', 'mother', 'as', 'scary', 'spirit', 'Mary', 'Lou', 'being', 'drawn', 'trunk', 'research', 'past', 'prom', 'queen', 'who', 'died', 'more', 'bargained', 'Mary', 'Lou', 'possession', 'also', 'finally', 'up', 'bitchy', 'mother', 'near', 'lesbian', 'scene', 'more', 'friendly', 'boyfriend', 'guess', 'never', 'did', 'much', 'beforehand', 'stand', 'up', 'more', 'enemies', 'accomplished', 'horror', 'fun', 'not', 'best', 'way', 'achieve', 'end', 'results', 'maybe', 'message', 'somewhere', 'here', 'Not', 'too', 'much', 'out', 'acting', 'Lisa', 'Schrage', 'Mary', 'Lou', 'made', 'part', 'Vicki', 'Wendy', 'Lyon', 'had', 'look', 'fit', 'acting', 'was', 'stiff', 'blended', 'somehow', 'remember', 'seeing', 'years', 'back', 'wondering', 'how', 'did', 'hair', 'particular', 'scene', 'strange', 'side', 'have', 'other', 'good', 'actors', 'such', 'Michael', 'Ironside', 'are', 'completely', 'intentional', 'not', 'general', 'theme', 'movie.Of', 'course', 'are', 'multitude', 'plot', 'holes', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'man', 'who', 'accidently', 'killed', 'prom', 'would', 'then', 'go', 'become', 'principal', 'there', 'instance', 'things', 'can', 'always', 'be', 'overlooked', 'when', 'offerings', 'Prom', 'Night', '2.While', 'B', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'lot', 'still', 'can', 'stand', 'proud', 'stinkers', 'out', 'there', 'script', ""n't"", 'so', 'foul', 'only', 'migraines', 'acting', ""n't"", 'so', 'low', 'reduced', 'high', 'school', 'play', 'levels', 'humor', 'actually', 'funny', 'cute', 'morbid', 'way.Do', ""n't"", 'rent', 'expected', 'sequel', 'original', 'prom', 'night', 'something', 'classy', 'rent', 'expecting', 'pure', 'simple', 'old', 'school', 'slasher', 'fun', 'what', ""'ll"", 'get']",N/A

There was also a sticker on the case that said ""On DVD for the First Time!"" The picture and sound were both crystal clear. No special features but that is to be expected. It seems the soundtrack is still in tact as well including Ricky Nelson's Hello Mary Lou. Sometimes it is hard licensing music onto old films due to legal/money/rights issues (the replaced music for the 2004 DVD of Happy Birthday to Me comes to mind). I'm assuming this is being re-released to coincide with the 2008 remake of Prom Night due out in theatres next week. I really enjoyed the first Prom Night with Jaime Lee Curtis. People should note that this film has nothing to do with the first one and that's not necessarily a bad thing although the same high school name is used. Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II is actually a very entertaining, fun horror flick with some comedic touches thrown in. It is sort of a cross between Carrie and The Exorcist. We open with the 1957 prom queen winner Mary Lou Maloney (Lisa Schrage) who goes up in a barrell of flames due to her jilted boyfriend being left behind for another guy. Fast forward 30 years later and Vickie Carpenter (Wendy Lyon) has been nominated prom queen. She is also dating the principal's son whose father just happens to be the guy responsible for Mary Lou's death. Suddenly, Mary Lou's unrested spirit is released and she is burning mad! (no pun intended) Vickie begins acting stranger by the day. She is saying things she doesn't normally say. She begins doing things she doesn't nomally do. She even comes to school dressed in clothes fit for 1957. What could be happening? If you are thinking Mary Lou is starting to possess Vickie's body to get revenge on those who wronged her or who stand in her way of becoming the 1987 prom queen, you would be right. There are many enjoyable moments to savor for those who don't mind taking a break from serious horror. There is also some very smart and witty dialogue, and the actors all did a nice job. This DVD is 5 stars all around.

I have seen this movie countless times and I think it was very well done in an era when these kinds of movies ran rampant.............the 80's, I don't know if it would stand up against some of the ones if it were made today the same way but it still gives me chills.Mary Lou Maloney was Prom Queen of the 1957 prom but unfortunately, a jealous boyfriend decided to play a joke on her a throw a stink bomb on stage from the rafters and ruin the proceedings, but as luck would have it, he ruined a lot more than that, he ruined her dress, her hair, her makeup and pretty much any chance for a life after High School because the stink bomb ignites the dress and turns her into a toasted Marshmallow...........BUT HEY, what kind of a movie would it be if it ended there, eh?.................CIRCA: 1987, 30 years later and strange things are happening at this school and most of them to poor Vicki Carpenter, who is running for Prom Queen, unfortunately for Vicki, someone else wants the crown who missed it by a stink's breath, MARY LOU and nothing is going to stand in her way......or NOBODY so, she does what any self respecting life entity does in a movie like this...she takes over Vicki's body and the fun starts and so does the body count.Hey, this movie is a slam dunk for anyone's collection who likes horror, it stars great Character actor Michael Ironside, from the TV Mini-series ""V"" and movies like THE NEXT KARATE KID.",5,"""There aint no god..and you wanna know what really pissed me off?.........""",1210032000,"05 6, 2008",2008,1564,"['F*****G', 'WINGS', '..this', 'just', 'one', 'line', 'movie', 'far', 'collection', 'one', 'creepiest', 'movies', 'own', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'countless', 'times', 'think', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'era', 'when', 'kinds', 'movies', 'ran', 'rampant', '80', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', 'stand', 'up', 'ones', 'were', 'made', 'today', 'same', 'way', 'still', 'chills.Mary', 'Lou', 'Maloney', 'was', 'Prom', 'Queen', '1957', 'prom', 'unfortunately', 'jealous', 'boyfriend', 'decided', 'play', 'joke', 'throw', 'stink', 'bomb', 'stage', 'rafters', 'ruin', 'proceedings', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'ruined', 'lot', 'more', 'ruined', 'dress', 'hair', 'makeup', 'pretty', 'much', 'chance', 'life', 'High', 'School', 'stink', 'bomb', 'dress', 'toasted', 'Marshmallow', 'HEY', 'what', 'kind', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'ended', 'there', 'eh', '..CIRCA', '1987', '30', 'years', 'later', 'strange', 'things', 'are', 'happening', 'school', 'most', 'poor', 'Vicki', 'Carpenter', 'who', 'running', 'Prom', 'Queen', 'unfortunately', 'Vicki', 'someone', 'else', 'crown', 'who', 'missed', 'stink', 'breath', 'MARY', 'LOU', 'nothing', 'going', 'stand', 'way', 'NOBODY', 'so', 'what', 'self', 'respecting', 'life', 'entity', 'movie', 'Vicki', 'body', 'fun', 'so', 'body', 'count.Hey', 'movie', 'slam', 'dunk', 'anyone', 'collection', 'who', 'horror', 'great', 'Character', 'actor', 'Michael', 'Ironside', 'TV', 'Mini-series', 'V', 'movies', 'THE', 'NEXT', 'KARATE', 'KID']",N/A
