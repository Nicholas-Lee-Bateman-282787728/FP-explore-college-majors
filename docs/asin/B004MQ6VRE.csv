1420221,AF61MRUO1WLFN,B004MQ6VRE,"C. Powell ""It's Always Sunny""","[17, 18]","This documentary is mainly about PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) all the way from the Civil War in 1861 up until The Iraq war in 2003-2010. Throughout these many different wars, Post Traumatic Stress has been called many things. Civil War they called it Hysteria or Melancholy, WWI they called it Shell-shock, WWII they called it Battle Fatigue, Vietnam and the Iraq War both called it Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. This Documentary which is just over an hour is not too hard to watch, but may be hard to watch by some who have been affected by PTSD or have even just been overseas. The documentary shows about 5 different lives that PTSD has affected as well as their families.The first was a Union soldier back in 1861 who committed suicide. Then there is a mother whom talks about her son that shot himself after coming back from Iraq. There is another segment in the film where a young soldier comes home from Iraq and within a month was arrested for putting a gun to a middle eastern taxi driver man's head. This is a sad segment, as well as the part in the film where a father of two explains how his son knew he was going crazy, but was not listened to by the military doctors and was told he was faking it and to get back to his room. Well they gave him his gun and bullets and set him to his room, as well as told his fellow soldiers to leave him alone and let him be...he shot himself back in his room. The last segment of this documentary was about a man who did 3 or 4 tours in Iraq and was discharged due to him losing it. The film shows him at his house looking at photos from Iraq and describing his feeling towards them. Also his family is in the room describing how he has changed and how he just like many other soldiers who went over there died when they went over there and came back someone else. PTSD is not in these soldiers' minds and is only increasing as many more men and women admit to having symptons rather than being neglectful of it and saying their fine when truly they are on a breaking point. I'd say sit back and learn a little somehting about our Wars and our soldiers that are affected by them..Overall, a good documentary to watch about PTSD. Very heart-felt and informative if you are interested by this sort of thing.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[8, 8]","WARTORN 1861-2010 (2010, though dated 2011) was a marvel, a riveting film that was as compelling as it was heartbreaking and unbearable. Produced and presented by James Gandolfini - who does all the interviews here - this film covers the serious disease PTSD (""post-traumatic stress disorder"") that afflicts around 45% of war veterans.Touching on one or two soldiers from every major war, beginning with the Civil War and ending with the Iraq War, this film allows the victims and their families to tell the stories in their own words, at their own pace. Letters from a young Civil War victim, read in a gradually weakening, quavering voice by an actor, are as effective as the face-to-face interviews with the present soldiers.I was most touched by the fact that WWII and Korean vets have benefitted the most, even if it is far too late, from recognition/treatments. The stories of several WWII vets will leave you in tears - but you will cry as much for the Iraq War vets and their stories. One came home and committed suicide; another young soldier drunkenly shot a Middle Eastern cab driver, thinking he was back in Iraq. After he was arrested he realized he wasn't having a nightmare - it was real. He received 6 years in the slam.Nice compassion.Notable is the lack of interviews with Korean War vets, and I think only two Vietnam vets are interviewed. The pace is crisp, the condition, while not defined or delineated properly, is explained so well through the victims themselves. In spite of the dreadful photos and film shown here, I think this should be part of American schools' curriculum. Kids and even soldiers' families need to learn about this. While I can't explain why Gandolfini chose to insert himself at key moments in the interviews, I guess that was his pejorative. The rest of the film is softly, respectfully silent while victims tell their stories.Also deeply impressing on me is the schizophrenic attitude the military has always maintained toward PTSD. One high-ranking Army officer, a doctor, is working toward dealing effectively with PTSD. He emphasized pulling the affected soldiers from duty when they begin to show signs, in order to save them.Yet in another case, a large family of vets told of their deceased loved one; this soldier returned from a visit with the base psychiatrist only to have his gun and ammo shoved into his hands by his C.O. He was ordered to go to his barracks and ""clean his gun"". All the others were ordered to leave him alone and not approach him in the barracks. ""What did they expect to happen?!"", his father complains in this film. This young soldier clearly shot himself, but oddly, the film avoids stating it.To which I shouted at the TV, ""They expected him to blow his brains out and end the trouble!!"" - my wife thought I was fighting with someone on the phone when she heard that. This film really is that moving. Usually, I do not like being moved in that way.A soldier told Gandolfini, ""They tell you to get over it; or to put it behind you. Well those are just words."" We need to watch our words when it comes to PTSD - Gandolfini was shocked when the soldier concluded: ""YOU go do the things I've done and get over it!""At a neat hour, with about 8 minutes of credits, this is THE must-see documentary of the real horrors of war ... and the horrors of the soldiers who return home. Much of who they were is left on the battle field, and families are left with a sort of ""Mr. Hyde"" version of the loved one who originally left to serve America.Maybe it's time we began rethinking how we ask our soldiers to ""serve"".",5,"""YOU go do the things I've done and get over it!""",1307232000,"06 5, 2011",2011,3586,"['WARTORN', '1861-2010', '2010', 'though', 'dated', '2011', 'was', 'marvel', 'riveting', 'film', 'was', 'as', 'compelling', 'was', 'heartbreaking', 'unbearable', 'Produced', 'presented', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'who', 'interviews', 'here', 'film', 'serious', 'disease', 'PTSD', 'post-traumatic', 'stress', 'disorder', 'around', '45', '%', 'war', 'veterans.Touching', 'one', 'two', 'soldiers', 'major', 'war', 'beginning', 'Civil', 'War', 'ending', 'Iraq', 'War', 'film', 'victims', 'families', 'tell', 'stories', 'own', 'words', 'own', 'pace', 'Letters', 'young', 'Civil', 'War', 'victim', 'read', 'gradually', 'weakening', 'quavering', 'voice', 'actor', 'are', 'as', 'effective', 'face-to-face', 'interviews', 'present', 'soldiers.I', 'was', 'most', 'touched', 'fact', 'WWII', 'Korean', 'vets', 'have', 'benefitted', 'most', 'even', 'far', 'too', 'late', 'recognition/treatments', 'stories', 'several', 'WWII', 'vets', 'will', 'leave', 'tears', 'will', 'cry', 'as', 'much', 'Iraq', 'War', 'vets', 'stories', 'One', 'came', 'home', 'committed', 'suicide', 'young', 'soldier', 'drunkenly', 'shot', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'cab', 'driver', 'thinking', 'was', 'back', 'Iraq', 'was', 'arrested', 'realized', 'was', ""n't"", 'having', 'nightmare', 'was', 'real', 'received', '6', 'years', 'slam.Nice', 'compassion.Notable', 'lack', 'interviews', 'Korean', 'War', 'vets', 'think', 'only', 'two', 'Vietnam', 'vets', 'are', 'interviewed', 'pace', 'crisp', 'condition', 'not', 'defined', 'delineated', 'properly', 'explained', 'so', 'well', 'victims', 'spite', 'dreadful', 'photos', 'film', 'shown', 'here', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'part', 'American', 'schools', 'curriculum', 'Kids', 'even', 'soldiers', 'families', 'need', 'learn', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'why', 'Gandolfini', 'chose', 'insert', 'key', 'moments', 'interviews', 'guess', 'was', 'pejorative', 'rest', 'film', 'softly', 'respectfully', 'silent', 'victims', 'tell', 'stories.Also', 'deeply', 'impressing', 'schizophrenic', 'attitude', 'military', 'always', 'maintained', 'PTSD', 'One', 'high-ranking', 'Army', 'officer', 'doctor', 'working', 'dealing', 'effectively', 'PTSD', 'emphasized', 'pulling', 'affected', 'soldiers', 'duty', 'when', 'begin', 'show', 'signs', 'order', 'save', 'them.Yet', 'case', 'large', 'family', 'vets', 'told', 'deceased', 'loved', 'one', 'soldier', 'returned', 'visit', 'base', 'psychiatrist', 'only', 'have', 'gun', 'ammo', 'shoved', 'hands', 'C.O', 'was', 'ordered', 'go', 'barracks', 'clean', 'gun', 'others', 'were', 'ordered', 'leave', 'alone', 'not', 'approach', 'barracks', 'What', 'did', 'expect', 'happen', 'father', 'film', 'young', 'soldier', 'clearly', 'shot', 'oddly', 'film', 'avoids', 'stating', 'it.To', 'shouted', 'TV', 'expected', 'blow', 'brains', 'out', 'end', 'trouble', 'wife', 'thought', 'was', 'fighting', 'someone', 'phone', 'when', 'heard', 'film', 'really', 'moving', 'Usually', 'do', 'not', 'being', 'moved', 'way.A', 'soldier', 'told', 'Gandolfini', 'tell', 'get', 'put', 'Well', 'are', 'just', 'words', 'need', 'watch', 'words', 'when', 'PTSD', 'Gandolfini', 'was', 'shocked', 'when', 'soldier', 'concluded', 'go', 'do', 'things', ""'ve"", 'done', 'get', 'neat', 'hour', '8', 'minutes', 'credits', 'must-see', 'documentary', 'real', 'horrors', 'war', 'horrors', 'soldiers', 'who', 'return', 'home', 'Much', 'who', 'were', 'left', 'battle', 'field', 'families', 'are', 'left', 'sort', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'version', 'loved', 'one', 'who', 'originally', 'left', 'serve', 'America.Maybe', 'time', 'began', 'rethinking', 'how', 'ask', 'soldiers', 'serve']",N/A

L LaRegina ""Jim LaRegina""","[0, 0]","As I write this in 2013 the United States is still warring with and occupying Afghanistan and, albeit with even less publicity, Iraq.  Lies take longer to tell than truths, after all, hence these incredibly long, needless wars supported by lies of two American presidents and counting since 2001.The 2010 documentary WARTORN tells the truth about war, so it's over in just 75 minutes.  As WARTORN honestly tells it, even the guys who win the conflict can still end up losing because of the psychological effects of killing.  WARTORN's film clips and photos of the dead from the Civil War to Afghanistan and Iraq, both soldier and civilian, ought to give you a hint.  But if you're slow, just listen to the WARTORN testimonies of American troops and their families about what happens when Johnny comes marching home.WARTORN refers to the mental illness suffered by soldiers as post-traumatic stress disorder.  Do an on-line video search of ""George Carlin Shell Shock,"" for a clip of the late, great comedian in the 1980s where in just two minutes and 40 seconds (again, the truth never takes long) he explains why, instead of the proper designation of shell shock, the sickness has come to be known by that loopy name ""post-traumatic stress disorder.""  When words are used to obscure information rather than convey it, you get terms like that.Nonetheless, WARTORN communicates what war does to the troops those in favor of invading nations would tell you to support.  See WARTORN.One last thing.  If you wonder why the graphic battlefield images WARTORN presents have so often failed to make it to news reports all these years, look up who owns the print and broadcast organizations that control all information outside of the small number of independent media.  For example, weapons manufacturer General Electric owns the N.B.C. television network, conflict of interest be damned.  With all the news coverage of the June 2013 death of James Gandolfini, who produced WARTORN and conducts several interviews in the documentary, how many mentions of WARTORN made the reports you saw?",5,Telling the truth never takes as long as it does to lie,1373241600,"07 8, 2013",2013,2080,"['write', '2013', 'United', 'States', 'still', 'warring', 'occupying', 'Afghanistan', 'even', 'less', 'publicity', 'Iraq', 'Lies', 'take', 'longer', 'tell', 'truths', 'hence', 'incredibly', 'long', 'needless', 'wars', 'supported', 'lies', 'two', 'American', 'presidents', 'counting', '2001.The', '2010', 'documentary', 'WARTORN', 'truth', 'war', 'over', 'just', '75', 'minutes', 'WARTORN', 'honestly', 'even', 'guys', 'who', 'win', 'conflict', 'can', 'still', 'end', 'up', 'losing', 'psychological', 'effects', 'killing', 'WARTORN', 'film', 'clips', 'photos', 'dead', 'Civil', 'War', 'Afghanistan', 'Iraq', 'soldier', 'civilian', 'ought', 'give', 'hint', ""'re"", 'slow', 'just', 'listen', 'WARTORN', 'testimonies', 'American', 'troops', 'families', 'what', 'when', 'Johnny', 'marching', 'home.WARTORN', 'refers', 'mental', 'illness', 'suffered', 'soldiers', 'post-traumatic', 'stress', 'disorder', 'Do', 'on-line', 'video', 'search', 'George', 'Carlin', 'Shell', 'Shock', 'clip', 'late', 'great', 'comedian', '1980s', 'where', 'just', 'two', 'minutes', '40', 'seconds', 'again', 'truth', 'never', 'long', 'why', 'instead', 'proper', 'designation', 'shell', 'shock', 'sickness', 'come', 'be', 'known', 'loopy', 'name', 'post-traumatic', 'stress', 'disorder', 'When', 'words', 'are', 'used', 'obscure', 'information', 'rather', 'convey', 'get', 'terms', 'that.Nonetheless', 'WARTORN', 'what', 'war', 'troops', 'favor', 'invading', 'nations', 'would', 'tell', 'support', 'See', 'WARTORN.One', 'last', 'thing', 'wonder', 'why', 'graphic', 'battlefield', 'images', 'WARTORN', 'presents', 'have', 'so', 'often', 'failed', 'make', 'news', 'reports', 'years', 'look', 'up', 'who', 'print', 'broadcast', 'organizations', 'control', 'information', 'small', 'number', 'independent', 'media', 'example', 'weapons', 'manufacturer', 'General', 'Electric', 'N.B.C', 'television', 'network', 'conflict', 'interest', 'be', 'damned', 'news', 'coverage', 'June', '2013', 'death', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'who', 'produced', 'WARTORN', 'several', 'interviews', 'documentary', 'how', 'many', 'mentions', 'WARTORN', 'made', 'reports', 'saw']",N/A

It will not take you to the next level of what help is available, but that's probably because neither the VA, military nor society is dealing with the magnitude of this war caused outcome in any satisfactory fashion. I felt sick and sad after watching this because I am tired dealing with my own battle with my own veteran and the problems PTSD is continuing to cause in our lives.  The man that left is not the man who returned and  I doubt we will ever see him again.  Its like a death having occurred where you still see the body walking around after the fact infusing the former self with every negative energy designed to kill off the remainder of its own soul.I beg society considers every war to which it chooses to sacrifice young men in its own defense.  I demand society to research and implement a comprehensive program to re-adapt these men back to society as best as possible and take responsibility for the cost of what they would deem 'heroic' if they indeed consider a war to be in the interest of their own 'best defense'.",5,Veterans wife,1318982400,"10 19, 2011",2011,1147,"['documentary', 'probably', 'as', 'close', 'can', 'get', 'depicting', 'surface', 'what', 'combat', 'PTSD', 'will', 'not', 'take', 'next', 'level', 'what', 'help', 'available', 'probably', 'VA', 'military', 'society', 'dealing', 'magnitude', 'war', 'caused', 'outcome', 'satisfactory', 'fashion', 'felt', 'sick', 'sad', 'watching', 'am', 'tired', 'dealing', 'own', 'battle', 'own', 'veteran', 'problems', 'PTSD', 'continuing', 'cause', 'lives', 'man', 'left', 'not', 'man', 'who', 'returned', 'doubt', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'again', 'death', 'having', 'occurred', 'where', 'still', 'see', 'body', 'walking', 'around', 'fact', 'infusing', 'former', 'self', 'negative', 'energy', 'designed', 'kill', 'off', 'remainder', 'own', 'soul.I', 'beg', 'society', 'considers', 'war', 'sacrifice', 'young', 'men', 'own', 'defense', 'demand', 'society', 'research', 'implement', 'comprehensive', 'program', 're-adapt', 'men', 'back', 'society', 'as', 'best', 'possible', 'take', 'responsibility', 'cost', 'what', 'would', 'deem', ""'heroic"", 'indeed', 'consider', 'war', 'be', 'interest', 'own', ""'best"", 'defense']",N/A

I agree with that.  Unfortunately, there has been little treatment.  Returning vets are discouraged from self-identifying PTSD, with veiled threats about losing benefits,  and having a ton of paperwork to fill out.  In some cases, the vets are ""walked through"" the paperwork, and are told how to fill out the debriefing forms.  My wife is a therapist who has worked with Army vets at Ft.
