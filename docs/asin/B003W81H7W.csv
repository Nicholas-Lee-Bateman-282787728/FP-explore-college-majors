1368334,AJASGOXDLFHR9,B003W81H7W,Ace,"[6, 6]","Wow, so many 5 star reviews! An example of a 5 star indie film in my opinion would be the EVIL DEAD, and not COLIN. At 5 stars you really have nowhere else to go as that is the summit. Do we really believe that these two films are on par with each other and that there is little room for improvement? I think not. Although they have a similar pedigree; indie/small budget/undead cinema fare, the EVIL DEAD is sooo much better despite its extreme vintage. Also, contrary to many opinions, COLIN is not the first Zombie film to portray events from the undead perspective. There are a number of films that portrayed that at least to some degree. One of them is I,ZOMBIE, (1999), though it spent more time detailing the physical and psychological changes that afflicted the hapless victim as he turned. The same Director was also responsible for DEAD CREATURES (2001), which told a similar tale of Zombie lifestyle, (see my review on Amazon). COLIN is an extremely tedious and ponderous film. I continually found myself watching the clock as it never seemed to ""jump"". Where COLIN could have redeemed itself (in the gore department), it also failed. The undead victim in COLIN eventually turned into a half decent stage 3 Zombie, though the pay off was too little and too late. Lots of flaws, like after feeding there was no blood on his face, weird sub plots that did not work well,...and the camera work stunk. For example, much of the film is under exposed and the action shots feature that irritating hand held filming technique which has been worked to death. All of this made the film fatiguing to watch, while it obscured the gore. Overall the acting was also spotty to say the least, and I did not care for the lead zombie either. On the plus side COLIN is a serious attempt at Horror that featured the classic Romero shambler type zombies. Also, thankfully this was not a ""Zomedy"", (which would have totally sunk it). There certainly was a stab at making this a decent entry into the Zombie film field, though it comes up short. Stick with the above noted Andrew PARKINSON films, especially I,ZOMBIE (though it also falls into my marginal category). Curiously, the keep case lists COLIN's run time at 165 minutes though my DVD clocked it at a still bloated 137 minutes. Much of COLIN should have been left on the cutting room floor. Nonetheless, I recognize the effort put into COLIN though there is no escaping the fact that it is a boring, poorly paced, marginal Zombie film. While many apparently disagree, I refuse to bow to the ""Emperor's New Clothes Syndrome"" and pay undue homage to a film just because of the circumstances that surround its production. As the film maker decided to take the plunge, then take the heat and get on with it. I absolutely agree to give the film maker kudos especially when one considers what he had to work with, but please do not insult the intelligence of the thoughtful film community with all of these maximum ratings.

1368336,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B003W81H7W,blackaciddevil,"[0, 0]","Mmmkay. Colin takes an interesting premise as a movie by telling the story from a zombie's perspective. During the course of the movie, we find out exactly who Colin was and, more importantly, what he has become. We follow him as he wanders the streets during the zombie apocalypse, through all his encounters with the living-dead(or undead)-places and even objects.  We find out what it is like to be an individual. Even more importantly, why we should value our individuality in being human.I'll be brutally honest, folks, I was a little put-off with this film at first. I mean, you can tell almost immediately that this movie was made on a, supposed, $70 budget. Not only that but it was made with a standard definition Panasonic mini-dv camcorder that the director had owned for 10 years. It was edited on his home PC using Adobe Premiere 6 software which had come bundled with a video capture card he'd purchased a few years before. Upon repeated viewings, the movie grew on me. More importantly, it got me to thinking of how someone such as this came up with a story about the Human condition after being turned into a zombie and how noone else(not even the Hollywood bigwigs) came up with the idea before. Sure, other movies have attempted it but not quite the way Colin was done. Imagine what could have been done if the Director had the kind of budget directors in Hollywood get. It would have turned the zombie genre on its' ear, believe me. As it stands, though, it was made just as it was...and, for what it is, Colin is a great little film.You're going to read mixed reviews on this movie, I'm sure. People will say the movie was boring, uninspired and cheap...and, above all, one movie you should definitely stay away from and not waste your money on. To which I say, give this film a chance. Watch it with an open-mind. You'll realize this guy was a real genius when he came up with the concept for the movie. Okay; so it was made on, practically, no budget at all. One thing this film has that alot of Hollywood zombie movies don't is heart.I highly recommend this one.

It is an interesting idea - a zombie flick told from the point of view of the Zombie.  Unfortunately that is a concept that, while interesting, is entertaining for a short period of time.  There are scenes that move SOOOO slowly that my friends and I were shouting ""come on already"" and several friends took a break and came back, and said ""what did I miss?"" we replied - nothing, it is still the same scene.  It's low budget but they did a decent job with effects.  Seeing the world from a camera that is shaking frequently (to see things from the Zombie Colin's point of view) becomes an irritable headache in short order.  The film dragged and the entire tale could have been told effectively in 40 minutes.  It does have redeeming moments and I enjoyed watching the end of the film, a flashback to how he received his zombie-virus infection.  That was lovely and gave the film and character more depth. The acting was quite good.  The long sequences of shaking camera, extended zombie attack scene in a house with many people just doing zombie moaning and groaning and attacking uninfected humans for about 15 minutes was just silly.  People all squashed into a room milling around, implausible how long it took to attack the uninfected - it was poorly done.  However, if you have a good fast forward button, and can watch the key scenes and fast forward the ones that drag on interminable, it's an okay film.  Not great, but okay (one of my friends walked out - not able to be patient with how slow the film was).  Hope this helps some of you decide if the film is for you or not!",3,"Interesting Idea, drags slowly and low budget",1302912000,"04 16, 2011",2011,1649,"['bought', 'film', 'due', 'very', 'good', 'reviews', 'many', 'provided', 'interesting', 'idea', 'zombie', 'flick', 'told', 'point', 'view', 'Zombie', 'Unfortunately', 'concept', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'are', 'scenes', 'move', 'SOOOO', 'slowly', 'friends', 'were', 'shouting', 'come', 'already', 'several', 'friends', 'took', 'break', 'came', 'back', 'said', 'what', 'did', 'miss', 'replied', 'nothing', 'still', 'same', 'scene', 'low', 'budget', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'effects', 'Seeing', 'world', 'camera', 'shaking', 'frequently', 'see', 'things', 'Zombie', 'Colin', 'point', 'view', 'irritable', 'headache', 'short', 'order', 'film', 'dragged', 'entire', 'tale', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'effectively', '40', 'minutes', 'have', 'redeeming', 'moments', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'end', 'film', 'flashback', 'how', 'received', 'zombie-virus', 'infection', 'was', 'lovely', 'gave', 'film', 'character', 'more', 'depth', 'acting', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'long', 'sequences', 'shaking', 'camera', 'extended', 'zombie', 'attack', 'scene', 'house', 'many', 'people', 'just', 'doing', 'zombie', 'moaning', 'groaning', 'attacking', 'uninfected', 'humans', '15', 'minutes', 'was', 'just', 'silly', 'People', 'squashed', 'room', 'milling', 'implausible', 'how', 'long', 'took', 'attack', 'uninfected', 'was', 'poorly', 'done', 'However', 'have', 'good', 'fast', 'forward', 'button', 'can', 'watch', 'key', 'scenes', 'fast', 'forward', 'ones', 'drag', 'interminable', 'okay', 'film', 'Not', 'great', 'okay', 'one', 'friends', 'walked', 'out', 'not', 'able', 'be', 'patient', 'how', 'slow', 'film', 'was', 'Hope', 'decide', 'film', 'not']",N/A

Romero once said that zombie films have about another good five years before Hollywood and the public tire of the genre. However, this does not seem to be the opinion George A. Romero has as of 2010 when he has been quoted by the Boston Globe as saying -- the genre is here to stay, and ""I don't think it will ever die.""Of course, Romero is more than a little biased, but I suspect that he must be excited about the abundant interest in zombies these last few years.And what an exciting time for zombies, especially when with a mere $75 dollar budget (Rumored), you too might earn a Cannes showing and $1 million dollar buy from a Japanese distributor (Rumored). This certainly was the case for a British-made zombie film called ""Colin"", which is an unconventional zombie-centric POV film that many fans of this genre have craved. A film with character versus the shock and mayhem we are often exposed to in this genre. I am not knocking the wildeye of the zombie apocalypse, but this introspective look into the death of a young man and his inevitable turn to zombie are reflected carefully and with instinctual specification from zombie eating behavior to the memories of his life before living undead.The pacing is neither tiresome or stuck in fast forward. Situations develop. They properly creep and shamble, dragging the viewer into the world of the zombie while emphasizing the emotional brutality and eccentricities of humankind and the undead.There is gore and brutality, but it is handled in a realistic and non over-the-top manner. The party scene in which we encounter a small band of humans fending off 20 or so zombies in an apartment is visually horrifying. In one particular instance, a young man is ripped from the clutches of his friend and dragged away into the horde. The tension, the will to survival cannot match the numbers and strength of the horde, but the young man hangs on to the bitter end. The pacing accentuates the tension and futility of struggling humans and the crack shot sound editing compliments the agony and gushing empathy the viewer will have toward the impending doomed fate of the young man.There is very little dialogue in this movie. There is more screaming, hissing, environmental noise, and background track, and this only serves to amplify the plight of the tiny corner of British civilization underseige by flesh eaters and supports the stark visualizations of our zombie's POV.I understand why this movie went to Cannes. It is a zombie movie that like Fido is a trailblazer in terms of where this genre is going. Just as zombies have evolved over time in film and other media, the zombie film itself has evolved. It's longevity can only be credited by the ability of this genre to change and adapt. I am personally excited to see where zombies venture forth in the future.The movie pays some homage to the movies that have come before it. Pay attention, to the shout out to Romero's ""Day of the Dead's"" Bub. Look for color reference. The solid backbone of this movie is it's very allegiance to follow this one character without falling prey to absurd cliche. With each frame he is relateable, primitive, and sympathetic. In order not to give the plot away, I am withholding a better explanation of what makes Colin so sympathetic.I leave you with this...The movie I believe begs us to ask ourselves some questions such as, ""Are we that far removed from Zombies let alone animals and/or our primitive ancestry?""

Even though Colin is a zombie, and of course what do we do with zombies, kill them  all, you actually get to see the human side of Colin, he has a family, friends, you almost want to feel bad for him, you can't help it really, but he is still a zombie, so of course you're like, um, yeah right.

1368342,AAW58LG72PG7I,B003W81H7W,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[0, 0]","Zombie films generally focus on the gore that results when the undead feast on the flesh of trapped and overrun humans.  COLIN has that too but it also includes other subtexts that give the viewer pause.  To begin with, it is one of the very few zombie films that present the action from one particular zombie's point of view.  Most viewers never even consider that a zombie has a point of view other than a driving urge to eat the living.  What would it be like to really be a re-animated corpse?  COLIN suggests that beneath the snarling open mouth of a zombie lies a fragmented wisp of memory of its former life.  In all zombie films, the undead always remember how to perform basic tasks of cerebration: shuffling walk, distinguishing between the living and the dead (notice how the dead never interact with one another?); using their senses to track and identify prey, and avoiding areas where prey is not to be found.  Colin is a recently dead zombie who wanders the streets like a wounded amnesiac Lear.  Despite his status, he seeks more out of life than his next meal.  Colin spends most of the film simply watching his dead brethern do their thing.  Zombies are ubiquitous as they seek out the living.  Colin shuffles about as he observes them as if he were witnessing a slightly interesting cricket match.  He pauses occasionally to join in--after all he is a zombie--but he is mostly the mute observer.  He sees things that register internally.  He meets his still living sister who binds him as she tries to stoke his buried humanity.  She fails but for the briefest of moments, Colin approaches the moral barrier that separates man from monster.  Many critics of COLIN have complained of the shaky hand held camera work, the unfocused footage, and the lack of continuity.  From this they declare a fault of the director who lacks a firm hand behind the camera.  Yet, I maintain that the wandering camera scenes and drifting focus are precisely the director's point.  We are watching from Colin's point of view.  Our eyes are only the filter through which he sees things.  We do not end by sympathizing with Colin, but we do note that in his case, at least, his shuffling gait leads to more than merely his next meal but rather to an insane attempt to make sense out of his far more insane new existence.",3,Surprisingly Effective,1316908800,"09 25, 2011",2011,2317,"['Zombie', 'films', 'generally', 'focus', 'gore', 'results', 'when', 'undead', 'feast', 'flesh', 'trapped', 'overrun', 'humans', 'COLIN', 'too', 'also', 'other', 'subtexts', 'give', 'viewer', 'pause', 'begin', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'zombie', 'films', 'present', 'action', 'one', 'particular', 'zombie', 'point', 'view', 'Most', 'viewers', 'never', 'even', 'consider', 'zombie', 'point', 'view', 'other', 'driving', 'urge', 'eat', 'living', 'What', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'be', 're-animated', 'corpse', 'COLIN', 'beneath', 'snarling', 'open', 'mouth', 'zombie', 'fragmented', 'wisp', 'memory', 'former', 'life', 'zombie', 'films', 'undead', 'always', 'remember', 'how', 'perform', 'basic', 'tasks', 'cerebration', 'shuffling', 'walk', 'distinguishing', 'living', 'dead', 'notice', 'how', 'dead', 'never', 'interact', 'one', 'using', 'senses', 'track', 'identify', 'prey', 'avoiding', 'areas', 'where', 'prey', 'not', 'be', 'found', 'Colin', 'recently', 'dead', 'zombie', 'who', 'streets', 'wounded', 'amnesiac', 'Lear', 'status', 'more', 'life', 'next', 'meal', 'Colin', 'most', 'film', 'simply', 'watching', 'dead', 'brethern', 'do', 'thing', 'Zombies', 'are', 'ubiquitous', 'seek', 'out', 'living', 'Colin', 'about', 'were', 'witnessing', 'slightly', 'interesting', 'cricket', 'match', 'occasionally', 'join', 'zombie', 'mostly', 'mute', 'observer', 'things', 'register', 'internally', 'still', 'living', 'sister', 'who', 'stoke', 'buried', 'humanity', 'briefest', 'moments', 'Colin', 'moral', 'barrier', 'man', 'monster', 'Many', 'critics', 'COLIN', 'have', 'complained', 'shaky', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'work', 'unfocused', 'footage', 'lack', 'continuity', 'declare', 'fault', 'director', 'who', 'firm', 'hand', 'camera', 'maintain', 'wandering', 'camera', 'scenes', 'drifting', 'focus', 'are', 'precisely', 'director', 'point', 'are', 'watching', 'Colin', 'point', 'view', 'eyes', 'are', 'only', 'filter', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'end', 'sympathizing', 'Colin', 'do', 'note', 'case', 'least', 'shuffling', 'gait', 'more', 'merely', 'next', 'meal', 'rather', 'insane', 'attempt', 'make', 'sense', 'far', 'more', 'insane', 'new', 'existence']",N/A

It has to keep you interested with a character who only grunts, hisses and moans.  I shave a star for it's rewatch value for a casual fan.  This movie has a flaw, that it is made for a specific fan base that really wants to watch a movie about a zombie, not a bunch of marines or survivalists... but about a zombie - without narration and little dialogue, save for people discussing whether Colin still has memories, and some survivalists attacking.  The lead is still a zombie and he plays it to the hilt leaving you unsure all the way if he has any memories or affections for family.

The plot is about a young man, Colin, and his descent into zombiehood.  The film begins in a modified in media res with Colin gripping a hammer, emotionally distraught, and bitten.  It takes the entire film to circle around to discover what has happened.  The plot is best left to be discovered by the viewer, so I won't focus on that.  Revealing it would be almost criminal.  Zombie fans that want an intelligent movie mixed with powerful drama will love it.  The film's long episodes of silence are unnerving.  It has some of the greatest most guttural and disturbing zombie attack scenes I have ever seen.  The absolute brilliance of this movie is in that it uses the mind to depict the horror of what is happening to victims more so than special effect gore.  The gore is well done but the budget of the movie forced it to depend on something else.  That ""something else"" almost has a magical quality.  I honestly think that if this film had been produced with a large budget that it could not have been improved.  There are scenes of zombies doing zombie things.  There are scenes of despair.  There are scenes of humans doing awful things to each other as the world disintegrates.  This movie has everything and pushes the envelope in ways I have not seen in a long time.  It has such power in its presentation.  The fact that the director took a brilliant script and produced this film for under $80.00 makes me shake my head in amazement and gives me hope that some of my own endeavors could come to light one day.  It is inspiring to see an independent effort come off so well.  Not only is the movie great, it outpaces other films with far larger budgets by amazing lengths.  COLIN is a sad film but beautiful.  It is thought provoking, moving, horrifying, original, heartbreaking, painful to watch, uncomfortable to watch, sinister, romantic, and haunting all at the same time.  The superb, and I do mean superb, acting by virtual unknowns make this production even more amazing.  Every single cast member gave it everything they had.  I can not emphasize this enough.  What an excellent ride it is!  If you are a fan of film or the zombie genre, pick this one up.
