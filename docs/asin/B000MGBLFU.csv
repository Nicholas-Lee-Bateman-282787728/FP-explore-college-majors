E Jackson,"[2, 3]","Sublime tries to be an intelligent suspense but instead it's one of those ""Oh, this is really boring and confusing until the very end when everything finally wraps up and makes sense"" type films.  The problem is, it's not suspenseful at all, and all comments about it being deeply disturbing and properly executing the fear of hospitals/surguries -despite a few emotional scene when the man first discovers that something is wrong- are all fairly exaggerated.The story- a man goes into a hospital to get a colonoscopy but it turns out that when moved to another floor, the doctos perform the wrong surgery unbeknownst to the patient until he wakes up and finds some of his other body parts have been removed.  Sounds intriguing and suspenseful so far, right?Then... a female nurse enters the room.  A sexy female nurse.  This is the point when the film goes downhill and never again recovers (though there's a brief recovery period later on when the man awakes and finds his daughter kissing another girl beside his bed along with an interesting trip down memory lane involving a story that he once said to his daughter).  Anyway about the nurse.  The problem is not only that she's attractive enough to be a porn star, but the actual pacing and atmosphere almost *changes* into a pornographic environment, and with a man lying there in a hospital bed recovering from the WRONG surgery... this is beyond terrible writing.  From here,  thoughts and dreams of his wife having sex with other people in the hospital enter the mans head while the sexy nurse is pushing the man around in a wheelchair in an attempt to dig up secretive information about his botched surgery.  Oh man this is brutal to watch.Another moment of interest appears when the patient tries to defend his case to his lawyer and to the other hospital workers at a meeting room, only to discover that he's not allowed to leave the hospital.  By this point I'm wondering why the mans wife isn't feeling any kind of fear or sadness or *any* kind of emotion whatsoever- she just sits by and hears the doctors having a conversation but never steps in to defend her husband.  This should send a red flag concerning the ending of the movie, and... it did.  Perhaps the writers should have included the REAL emotional way that a wife would respond to such an unfortunate incident when they discover their husband received the wrong surgery?  That would have given a boost to the conclusion and would've surprised viewers at least a *little* more.  Still, none of this excuses what I consider a lousy story overall and several moments of aimless, uninteresting/unsuspenseful writing.The problem is that Sublime would have worked sooooo much better had it focused on the patient waking up from a botched surgery and kept the emotional side in full swing instead of trying to wrap a confusing and unnecessary, barely adequate and relatable story around it.  It didn't though.  Instead... well, without giving away what happens, it ends up being a disappointment.",2,uh and ugh,1341532800,"07 6, 2012",2012,3017,"['Sublime', 'tries', 'be', 'intelligent', 'suspense', 'instead', 'one', 'Oh', 'really', 'boring', 'confusing', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'everything', 'finally', 'up', 'sense', 'type', 'films', 'problem', 'not', 'suspenseful', 'comments', 'being', 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'properly', 'executing', 'fear', 'hospitals/surguries', '-despite', 'few', 'emotional', 'scene', 'when', 'man', 'first', 'discovers', 'something', 'wrong-', 'are', 'fairly', 'exaggerated.The', 'story-', 'man', 'hospital', 'get', 'colonoscopy', 'out', 'when', 'moved', 'floor', 'doctos', 'perform', 'wrong', 'surgery', 'unbeknownst', 'patient', 'up', 'other', 'body', 'parts', 'have', 'been', 'removed', 'intriguing', 'suspenseful', 'so', 'far', 'right', 'Then', 'female', 'nurse', 'room', 'sexy', 'female', 'nurse', 'point', 'when', 'film', 'downhill', 'never', 'again', 'recovers', 'brief', 'recovery', 'period', 'later', 'when', 'man', 'awakes', 'daughter', 'kissing', 'girl', 'bed', 'interesting', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'involving', 'story', 'once', 'said', 'daughter', 'nurse', 'problem', 'not', 'only', 'attractive', 'enough', 'be', 'porn', 'star', 'actual', 'pacing', 'atmosphere', 'almost', '*changes*', 'pornographic', 'environment', 'man', 'lying', 'there', 'hospital', 'bed', 'recovering', 'WRONG', 'surgery', 'terrible', 'writing', 'here', 'thoughts', 'dreams', 'wife', 'having', 'sex', 'other', 'people', 'hospital', 'enter', 'mans', 'head', 'sexy', 'nurse', 'pushing', 'man', 'wheelchair', 'attempt', 'dig', 'up', 'secretive', 'information', 'botched', 'surgery', 'Oh', 'man', 'brutal', 'watch.Another', 'moment', 'interest', 'when', 'patient', 'defend', 'case', 'lawyer', 'other', 'hospital', 'workers', 'meeting', 'room', 'only', 'discover', 'not', 'allowed', 'leave', 'hospital', 'point', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'why', 'mans', 'wife', ""n't"", 'feeling', 'kind', 'fear', 'sadness', '*any*', 'kind', 'emotion', 'whatsoever-', 'just', 'sits', 'doctors', 'having', 'conversation', 'never', 'steps', 'defend', 'husband', 'should', 'send', 'red', 'flag', 'concerning', 'ending', 'movie', 'did', 'Perhaps', 'writers', 'should', 'have', 'included', 'REAL', 'emotional', 'way', 'wife', 'would', 'respond', 'unfortunate', 'incident', 'when', 'discover', 'husband', 'received', 'wrong', 'surgery', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'boost', 'conclusion', 'would', ""'ve"", 'surprised', 'viewers', 'least', '*little*', 'more', 'Still', 'none', 'what', 'consider', 'lousy', 'story', 'overall', 'several', 'moments', 'aimless', 'uninteresting/unsuspenseful', 'writing.The', 'problem', 'Sublime', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'sooooo', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'focused', 'patient', 'waking', 'up', 'botched', 'surgery', 'kept', 'emotional', 'side', 'full', 'swing', 'instead', 'trying', 'wrap', 'confusing', 'unnecessary', 'barely', 'adequate', 'relatable', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'Instead', 'well', 'giving', 'away', 'what', 'up', 'being', 'disappointment']",Sublime R-Rated Edition

1046004,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000MGBLFU,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[10, 15]","Sublime is a red hot tamale hidden within the predominantly bland cheese pizza of the horror industry.  Some like it, some hate it, but no one forgets the unexpected taste of it.  I do not like the box cover, though - to me, at least, the image conveys the notion of cutting and scarring, and that made me expect this film to be some kind of slasher film - psychological, of course, but still a slasher.  Well, it's not a slasher; I would classify it as horror, though - definitely; it's just a deeply psychological, symbolic type of horror that actually plays quite effectively.  I should note that there are a few scenes of a medically gruesome nature, which may have squeamish folks squirming, but this story is not about blood and gore at all.  I haven't seen the commentary on the DVD, which is probably both fortunate as well as unfortunate.  While I would be very interested in hearing the director and writer explain their insights into the story, the rabble I hear about one of them saying the unfortunate main character of this film somehow represents George W. Bush leaves me happy to enjoy the film as it was, free of any directorial politics.  I see no connection whatsoever to my President in this film, and I'm happy to keep it that way (putting such a political spin on the film I saw seems utterly inane from my perspective).  This is a rare case when I believe the commentary can actually harm your enjoyment and impressions of a film.It would be a crying shame for any reviewer to divulge any spoilers about this film, so I'm rather limited in what I can talk about.  At its most basic level, Sublime is the story of a man who goes in to the hospital for a routine colonoscopy, but - to his great misfortune - that routine procedure ends up being the polar opposite of routine.  Mistakes do happen, you know, resulting in as many as 100,000 deaths a year from what I have read (remember the case of doctors at Duke essentially killing a young girl by performing a heart and lung transplant with organs of the wrong blood type?).  George Grieves (Thomas Cavanagh) knows something is wrong as soon as he wakes up.  He's sweating like a hog, has an extraordinarily suspicious scar on his lower left abdomen (that would really be taking the long way to the colon), and he's sort of shoved off on the wrong floor across from the mysterious closed wing of the hospital.  There's no sign of his family or his doctor - just his nurse Zoe (Katherine Cunningham-Eves) and an exceedingly suspicious male nurse or orderly who makes George increasingly uneasy every time he comes by to change the IV bag.  Zoe happens to be everything I would want in a nurse, but even her uber-fine-ness can't make a dent in the anxiety and fear George is suddenly feeling.  Little does he know that the worst - and plenty of it - is still to come.  Basically, all of his deepest fears begin to realize themselves before his eyes, with virtually every new shock playing out against flashbacks of his fortieth birthday party the night before his ""test.""  Meanwhile, one medical mistake builds upon another, leaving George essentially trapped in a terrifying situation he can't understand.  Surreality doesn't even begin to describe the ordeal he has to endure.Like it or not, the success of a movie such as Sublime hinges almost completely on the conclusion.  How many great films have we seen utterly destroyed by a terrible ending?  Thankfully, Sublime really delivers at crunch time; while some viewers may successfully predict how it all plays out, the film definitely takes the road less traveled rather than selling out in the final moments.  That's really important to me.Different aspects of this story can and probably will be debated by those who see the film.  Personally, I think the filmmakers cast the net of George's fears a little too wide, as I see no reason why race was thrown into the mix.  I saw no real context for it, leaving me to interpret it as the product of an agenda on the part of the writer and director - and, for me, that took a little something away from the film.

I was drawn to this package by the comparisons to The Twilight Zone, and the association with John Shiban (formerly of the X-Files). I have grown weary of the endless stream of copycat Asian horror and welcome something new in this genre. If you're of the same mindset, I'd suggest you give this one a serious look.I can't go into too much detail without spoiling the plot, but suffice it to say that that action and psychology of the film spring from the mind of a middle aged white-bread male who is bedridden in a very strange ward in a hospital. There's little splatter or blood here (save for a surgical incision), and we the audience follow him as he goes from reminiscences - mostly family and friends - to the strange east ward of the facility.Despite the rather limited location, the movie kept my attention from beginning to end. Clocking in at 113 minutes, things were just about right, and the creators freed themselves from the token 90-minute horror standard. The movie tackles issues of innermost fears, and while I think the race issue was overplayed, there is some interesting political satire thrown into the mix, which is explained in detail during the director\writer commentary. The soundtrack is noteworthy, particularly the use of ethnic\techno hybrid sounds in the percussion. Used unobtrusively, it enhances the visual experience.So take your pick: if you are looking for troubled girl ghosts, serial killers with sickles, or the monster shtick, this isn't for you.

Well, the ratings and comments on this one were all over the place with the highest number of reviewers giving it one star. I was almost hesitant to put it on, yet a few people thought it was a really good movie. I'm in agreement with them, but I can easily understand the spread in ratings. This movie is not easy to watch or understand. It plays with your mind and you have to pay attention or you'll lose it. Once you've lost it, there's probably no way to get back.The movie is presented as a collage of scenes. Past, present, future, dreams, fears. lusts, prejudices and longings are all intermixed and pass by in set after set. It's up to your own mind to put it all together. Believe me, not everyone will be up to the task and they'll end up thinking it's a lousy movie. It's not. It's excellent! It's billed as a horror movie, but I would say it's much more of a complex mental exercise. Sure, there are some horrible things in it, but that doesn't make it a horror movie. The acting is quite good. The photography is good. The sound is a little too intrusive, in my opinion. But all in all, it's a well done movie.The main plot is centered about a man who is having a birthday party (about # 40) and is scheduled for a colonoscopy in the immediate future. Of course, that's going to plant a certain number of fears into anyone's mind. As he is getting prepped, he finds out that his Doctor is an Iranian. Now, how would you feel about having an Iranian do a colonoscopy on you? Then, almost all of us feel uneasy about hospitals in the first place, but everything is going wrong in this particular one. And the anxiety builds ever higher. Added to the scene is a beautiful nurse and the anxiety builds in a different direction. Then add an Afro-American male nurse with a cold and cruel demeanor to arouse a few deep-seated racial prejudices. Then have the patient changed to another room where he undergoes the wrong procedure by the wrong physician. Add a few highly negative discussions about the American health-care system and it's shortcomings. Slip in a few of his fear-ridden dreams while under sedation. Now, stir all of those scenes, and a lot of others, into an almost randomly-presented movie and you'll have something that will glue you to the TV screen. Don't leave, not for an instant. Get the snacks there first. Make sure you've peed. Don't converse. Settle back and watch a five-star movie unfold in all it's horror.Gary Peterson",5,"Surprisingly, A Really Good Movie.

""A New Yorker""","[2, 5]","I was mildly entertained with ""Rest Stop"" - although it was not perfect I expected for things to only improve as each film was released, unfortunately with ""SUBLIME"" things still remain the same. Not so much a horror movie as a deft medical thriller, ""Sublime"" is part of a new experiment by Warner Bros. to produce horror films that appeal to a wider audience. By that I'm assuming they mean the PG-13 crowd who are the target demographic of most studios producing genre movies these days, and as this movie shows, WB defines horror in the widest of terms. Antiquely written and superbly shot, this movie plays out like a long episode of The Outer Limits, which is not exactly in keeping with the excellently ghoulish DVD art. While I wouldn't call the movie horrifying or chock full of terrors, there are some genuinely creepy moments and plenty of disturbing medical paranoia.Tom Cavanagh puts in his usual fine performance as poor George, who has to deal with everything from an incompetent doctor, a attractive nurse, a murderous and preachy orderly and one nasty case of flesh eating bacteria (now that was sick!). Most of the other actors give stock performances, with the exception of Katherine Cunningham-Eves as George's nurse Zoe, and the ultra talented Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs as the insane and creepy orderly who keeps a tight leash on George's delirium.The hospital itself is gorgeous, and the medical mysteries of George's mishaps are frighteningly realistic. Director Tony Krantz (a veteran of TV's 24) and Writer Erik Jendresen (who wrote some episodes of my one of my favorite TV experience ever, Band of Brothers) create a plausible tale that is both entertaining and stylish.On the down side, the script was a little predictable, and the big twist was a bit ho-hum. The thing is, this sort of premise has been done much better before and with creepier results (think Jacob's Ladder). The gore is hardly there (except for a wicked torture scene that surprised even me), and nudity is non-existent. The dream sequences are so hokey that they detract from what should have been a touchable sense of dread in this film. Simply put, there are so many controversial places they could have gone to with this one, but they didn't.

I am a fan of all things `experimental', but they cannot dare call this experimental horror. I mean, any way you cut it, this film is very, very weak. It doesn't take a film scholar to figure that out.The casting is very `cheap', to say the least. Cavanagh is not an actor, and his presence only lowers this film to one of those D-Grade late night films that no one caught the first time out. My peeve with the film is not that its so bad that I want to trash it - rather, its to ask the film-makers WHY they thought something so pedestrian and wasteful was worth making. In this case, to say that this movie was a `waste of my time' would be an understatement. The film has no reason to exist, and I would highly advise them to get rid of all the negatives while they still have time.Oh and lets see - the `climax' of the movie had me gagging and almost barfing. Seriously dudes? Did you think you could pull that `It was all a Dream!!"" schtick so many years out of kindergarten? Jeez.

The attention to detail, the sumptuous imagery, and the incredibly precise directing make for compelling brain candy, but when you walk away from the experience, you realize your mind is still hungry.  This isn't a cinematic meal, in spite of the heavy helping of allegory, symbolism, philosophy and cultural references; it is a dark, well-spun mass of filmic cotton candy.Thomas Cavanagh plays George Grieves, who has just turned 40 and is being checked into Mt. Abaddon Hospital for a routine colonoscopy.  The routine goes wrong (as it is wont to do) when charts are mixed up and doctors make mistakes.  Before you know it, George is struggling against unhelpful (and sometimes TOO helpful) nurses, cold hospital lawyers, an oddly distant family, and formlessly sinister forces that prowl the halls of the East Wing -- currently under construction.What's going on?  Well, the tag line for the film is, ""Maybe if you spend your life worrying then the only way that your life will have meaning is if what you fear becomes real.""  George comes face-to-face with the tangled conjunction of virtually every one of his fears.  In one sense it is a mesmeric mosaic of metaphors, smartly-done, patient, probative.  In another sense it is a sloppy mess, a tossed salad of terror, drowned in the dark dressing of doom.Overwritten comparisons aside, the film is, in fact, very well-done.  Every single cast member gives an impressive performance (kudos to Cavanagh, et. al.), every single scene is set-up with archeological diligence (hats off to directorial newbie, Tony Krantz), and the dialogue is perfect -- almost stunning (standing O for screenwriter Erik Jendresen).What keeps this movie from being a great flick is it's lack of focus.  It tries so hard to be about so many things that it ends up being about very little at all.  In the last fifteen minutes, however, the story tries to rally every one of its disparate symbols and signs around one heady, political (some would say philosophical) point.  (Not to mention it makes use of a twist ending that has become so over-used in films these days that it couldn't really be called a ""twist"" anymore.)  In spite of this, it is mostly a success, but it is also repetitive and dragged-out.It's also stunningly neat-n-tidy, providing contrast to the rest of the script's every-which-way-but-loose modality.  Although I can't say it resonated with me, I can say that it was a pleasing last bite for a movie that -- while it didn't sate my hunger -- at least gave me something tasty to chew on for awhile.",4,Sublime-inal,1175644800,"04 4, 2007",2007,2706,"['Sublime', 'one', 'movies', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'time', 'lowered', 'bit', 'estimation', 'more', 'thought', 'later', 'attention', 'detail', 'sumptuous', 'imagery', 'incredibly', 'precise', 'directing', 'make', 'compelling', 'brain', 'candy', 'when', 'walk', 'away', 'experience', 'realize', 'mind', 'still', 'hungry', ""n't"", 'cinematic', 'meal', 'spite', 'heavy', 'helping', 'allegory', 'symbolism', 'philosophy', 'cultural', 'references', 'dark', 'well-spun', 'mass', 'filmic', 'cotton', 'candy.Thomas', 'Cavanagh', 'George', 'Grieves', 'who', 'just', 'turned', '40', 'being', 'checked', 'Mt', 'Abaddon', 'Hospital', 'routine', 'colonoscopy', 'routine', 'wrong', 'wont', 'do', 'when', 'charts', 'are', 'mixed', 'up', 'doctors', 'make', 'mistakes', 'know', 'George', 'struggling', 'unhelpful', 'sometimes', 'TOO', 'helpful', 'nurses', 'cold', 'hospital', 'lawyers', 'oddly', 'distant', 'family', 'formlessly', 'sinister', 'forces', 'prowl', 'halls', 'East', 'Wing', 'currently', 'construction.What', 'going', 'Well', 'tag', 'line', 'film', 'Maybe', 'spend', 'life', 'worrying', 'then', 'only', 'way', 'life', 'will', 'have', 'meaning', 'what', 'fear', 'becomes', 'real', 'George', 'face-to-face', 'tangled', 'conjunction', 'virtually', 'one', 'fears', 'one', 'sense', 'mesmeric', 'mosaic', 'metaphors', 'smartly-done', 'patient', 'probative', 'sense', 'sloppy', 'mess', 'tossed', 'salad', 'terror', 'drowned', 'dark', 'dressing', 'doom.Overwritten', 'comparisons', 'aside', 'film', 'fact', 'very', 'well-done', 'Every', 'single', 'cast', 'member', 'impressive', 'performance', 'kudos', 'Cavanagh', 'et', 'al', 'single', 'scene', 'set-up', 'archeological', 'diligence', 'hats', 'off', 'directorial', 'newbie', 'Tony', 'Krantz', 'dialogue', 'perfect', 'almost', 'stunning', 'standing', 'O', 'screenwriter', 'Erik', 'Jendresen', 'movie', 'being', 'great', 'flick', 'lack', 'focus', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'up', 'being', 'very', 'little', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'however', 'story', 'tries', 'rally', 'one', 'disparate', 'symbols', 'signs', 'one', 'heady', 'political', 'would', 'say', 'philosophical', 'point', 'Not', 'mention', 'use', 'twist', 'ending', 'become', 'so', 'over-used', 'films', 'days', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'be', 'called', 'twist', 'anymore', 'spite', 'mostly', 'success', 'also', 'repetitive', 'dragged-out.It', 'also', 'stunningly', 'neat-n-tidy', 'providing', 'contrast', 'rest', 'script', 'every-which-way-but-loose', 'modality', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'resonated', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'pleasing', 'last', 'bite', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'sate', 'hunger', 'least', 'gave', 'something', 'tasty', 'chew', 'awhile']",Sublime R-Rated Edition

1046026,A3BKIVVRFP7X6M,B000MGBLFU,R.C. Collins,"[8, 12]","[This review contains NO spoilers.]Sublime is a movie about a man that goes in for a colonoscopy and wakes up having found out that there was a mix-up and the wrong procedure was performed. It follows his struggles after this to just get out of the hospital with strange things going on around him with his care and the rest of the hospital. That's the plot in a nutshell.A movie like this where the main character is confused about what is going on (and the audience views the film through that character's eyes - without any outside narration or the POV of other characters) hinges on how the situation unfolds and what the eventual outcome is. For instance, a mystery novel needs to have a satisfying trail of clues and a satisfying payoff where the mystery is solved at the end. In this respect, I think this movie fails. The trail of clues was poor in that I was pretty sure exactly what the situation was pretty early on in the movie. (I won't say anymore than that because I do not want to spoil it for anyone.) The solution at the end of the film was also uninspired. The entire buildup of the film leads to no real payoff.Another aspect of this movie that I did not like was the heavy-handed treatment given to ""the message"" in it. The filmmakers want to make a point regarding fear in our society and how white males cower in fear all the time. It's a point I'm not particularly impressed with for depth of thought and I was not impressed with the execution of it given how thick it was laid on the audience. I tired of it quickly.I did find the makeup showing the maladies affecting the main character to be quite effective. That was well done. I also thought that the atmosphere in the film was well done. The hospital has an appropriate creepy feeling for what is going on. And the acting was also quite good too. I've long been a fan of Tom Cavanagh and it was interesting to see him in a role that is not traditional for him. Very nice surprise and excellent work on his part.With those positives being said, they do not make up for the poor story and overkill with the message of the film (to the point where I felt belittled by it) and so I am only giving Sublime 2 stars.sincerely,R.C.",2,"Predictable Plot, Interesting Imagery",1175299200,"03 31, 2007",2007,2203,"['[', 'review', 'spoilers', ']', 'Sublime', 'movie', 'man', 'colonoscopy', 'up', 'having', 'found', 'out', 'was', 'mix-up', 'wrong', 'procedure', 'was', 'performed', 'struggles', 'just', 'get', 'hospital', 'strange', 'things', 'going', 'care', 'rest', 'hospital', 'plot', 'nutshell.A', 'movie', 'where', 'main', 'character', 'confused', 'what', 'going', 'audience', 'film', 'character', 'eyes', 'outside', 'narration', 'POV', 'other', 'characters', 'hinges', 'how', 'situation', 'unfolds', 'what', 'eventual', 'outcome', 'instance', 'mystery', 'novel', 'needs', 'have', 'satisfying', 'trail', 'clues', 'satisfying', 'payoff', 'where', 'mystery', 'solved', 'end', 'respect', 'think', 'movie', 'trail', 'clues', 'was', 'poor', 'was', 'pretty', 'sure', 'exactly', 'what', 'situation', 'was', 'pretty', 'early', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'anymore', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'spoil', 'anyone', 'solution', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'uninspired', 'entire', 'buildup', 'film', 'real', 'payoff.Another', 'aspect', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'was', 'heavy-handed', 'treatment', 'given', 'message', 'filmmakers', 'want', 'make', 'point', 'regarding', 'fear', 'society', 'how', 'white', 'males', 'cower', 'fear', 'time', 'point', ""'m"", 'not', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'depth', 'thought', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'execution', 'given', 'how', 'thick', 'was', 'laid', 'audience', 'tired', 'did', 'find', 'makeup', 'showing', 'maladies', 'affecting', 'main', 'character', 'be', 'quite', 'effective', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'also', 'thought', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'hospital', 'appropriate', 'creepy', 'feeling', 'what', 'going', 'acting', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'too', ""'ve"", 'long', 'been', 'fan', 'Tom', 'Cavanagh', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'role', 'not', 'traditional', 'Very', 'nice', 'surprise', 'excellent', 'work', 'part.With', 'positives', 'being', 'said', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'up', 'poor', 'story', 'overkill', 'message', 'film', 'point', 'where', 'felt', 'belittled', 'so', 'am', 'only', 'giving', 'Sublime', '2', 'stars.sincerely', 'R.C']",Sublime R-Rated Edition

I had already read an article on Fangoria's website about the metaphorical implications of the film, but when I actually watched it, I guess I was surprised that they appeared so heavy-handed. Don't get me wrong - the metaphors and the symbolism made sense, they made a lot of sense, but they would have been more appealing with a bit more subtlety.I was impressed to see Tom Cavanagh actually kind of act - I think he tends to fall back on his aw-shucks good looks way too often. Mandingo's character was one who could have used a lot more subtlety, but seeing as how he really blossoms during the apex of the film, it does make sense that he's a bit overdone at that point.It really wasn't a bad film. I certainly didn't find it to be as bad as a lot of other reviewers seemed to. I just like my symbolism to be under a few more layers - I like to sit back a week or so after watching and have realizations hit me like  atruck. It didn't happen this way - I was bombarded with the information right off the bat, and that's kind of too bad. It would have meant more if I had to work for it.Anyhow, give it a shot.

1046029,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000MGBLFU,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 5]","Sublime (Tony Krantz, 2007)Young, and very hot, producer Tony Krantz (24) sits in the director's chair for the first time for Sublime, an oddly-named psychological horror flick that starts out as a medical-incredible gone horribly wrong and attempts to grow into an extended meditation on rage, medical malpractice, white guilt, infidelity, and a whole host of other interesting topics. While it never quite succeeds, it's an incredibly ambitious piece of work, and bodes well for both Krantz and screenwriter Erik Jendresen (Deadlocked) going very far, once they've got a bit more experience under their belts.George Grieves (Thomas Cavanagh, recently of How to Eat Fried Worms) goes in for a routine colonoscopy on his fortieth birthday, plagued by memories of a birthday party that was always on the verge of going bad the night before. When he wakes up, he discovers that, through a clerical error, a patient with a similar name got his procedure, and he was given an operation that has had some unforeseen complications. George, with the help of his guilty-feeling nurse Zoe (The Passage of Mrs. Calabash's Katherine Cunningham-Eves), tries to figure out why, all the sudden, everything seems to have gotten really, really weird since he woke up--is he going crazy as one of the side effects of the surgery, or is there really something more sinister behind what happened to him? All this is made worse by the presence of Mandingo (Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs, probably the best thing about the short-lived TV adaptation of Alien Nation), a male nurse who seems to head George and Zoe off at the pass whenever they get too close to an answer.Technically, the film does what it's supposed to do, and does it passably well. The camerawork and lighting are exceptionally well-done for a film that came in under two million bucks, providing an atmosphere that's suitably claustrophobic. The acting is never less than competent, but veers, sometimes in the same character, from the ridiculous, to, well, you know. What's missing is the script, or part of it; Jendresen tried to cram a whole lot of ideas into a movie of less than two hours; everything referenced here could have easily expanded to fill four. The end result is we get a little of everything, but not much in depth of anything. The most depressing thing, however, is (judging by the comments) the number of people who didn't catch the reason behind Mandingo's name (and thus didn't catch the odd look George gets when he reports it, or misinterpreted it); watcgh the film of the same name before seeing this if you don't get the joke, and much will be made clear. I can't unhesitatingly recommend this deeply flawed movie, but if you can enjoy a film based on the potential it has, you'll find a rich vein of it here. ** ",3,"Not at all what it could have been, but still watchable.",1184716800,"07 18, 2007",2007,2781,"['Sublime', 'Tony', 'Krantz', '2007', 'Young', 'very', 'hot', 'producer', 'Tony', 'Krantz', '24', 'sits', 'director', 'chair', 'first', 'time', 'Sublime', 'oddly-named', 'psychological', 'horror', 'flick', 'out', 'medical-incredible', 'gone', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'attempts', 'grow', 'extended', 'meditation', 'rage', 'medical', 'malpractice', 'white', 'guilt', 'infidelity', 'whole', 'host', 'other', 'interesting', 'topics', 'never', 'quite', 'incredibly', 'ambitious', 'piece', 'work', 'bodes', 'well', 'Krantz', 'screenwriter', 'Erik', 'Jendresen', 'Deadlocked', 'going', 'very', 'far', 'once', ""'ve"", 'got', 'bit', 'more', 'experience', 'belts.George', 'Grieves', 'Thomas', 'Cavanagh', 'recently', 'How', 'Eat', 'Fried', 'Worms', 'routine', 'colonoscopy', 'fortieth', 'birthday', 'plagued', 'memories', 'birthday', 'party', 'was', 'always', 'verge', 'going', 'bad', 'night', 'before', 'When', 'up', 'clerical', 'error', 'patient', 'similar', 'name', 'got', 'procedure', 'was', 'given', 'operation', 'had', 'unforeseen', 'complications', 'George', 'help', 'guilty-feeling', 'nurse', 'Zoe', 'Passage', 'Mrs.', 'Calabash', 'Katherine', 'Cunningham-Eves', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'sudden', 'everything', 'have', 'gotten', 'really', 'really', 'weird', 'woke', 'up', 'going', 'crazy', 'one', 'side', 'effects', 'surgery', 'really', 'something', 'more', 'sinister', 'what', 'happened', 'made', 'worse', 'presence', 'Mandingo', 'Lawrence', 'Hilton-Jacobs', 'probably', 'best', 'thing', 'short-lived', 'TV', 'adaptation', 'Alien', 'Nation', 'male', 'nurse', 'who', 'head', 'George', 'Zoe', 'off', 'pass', 'whenever', 'get', 'too', 'close', 'answer.Technically', 'film', 'what', 'supposed', 'do', 'passably', 'well', 'camerawork', 'lighting', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'well-done', 'film', 'came', 'two', 'million', 'bucks', 'providing', 'atmosphere', 'suitably', 'claustrophobic', 'acting', 'never', 'less', 'competent', 'veers', 'sometimes', 'same', 'character', 'ridiculous', 'well', 'know', 'What', 'missing', 'script', 'part', 'Jendresen', 'tried', 'cram', 'whole', 'lot', 'ideas', 'movie', 'less', 'two', 'hours', 'everything', 'referenced', 'here', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'expanded', 'fill', 'four', 'end', 'result', 'get', 'little', 'everything', 'not', 'much', 'depth', 'anything', 'most', 'depressing', 'thing', 'however', 'judging', 'comments', 'number', 'people', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'reason', 'Mandingo', 'name', 'thus', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'odd', 'look', 'George', 'when', 'misinterpreted', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'seeing', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'joke', 'much', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'clear', 'ca', ""n't"", 'unhesitatingly', 'recommend', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'movie', 'can', 'enjoy', 'film', 'based', 'potential', ""'ll"", 'find', 'rich', 'vein', 'here', '**']",Sublime R-Rated Edition

The cover art has little to nothing to do with the story and, I believe, intentionally misleading to audiences who think they are getting a ""Saw"" type of film.  Two, it was far too predictable.  Then, Steve, why three stars?Well, this film may be inappropriately marketed and too predictable, but that doesn't mean it isn't well-executed and interesting.  The actors are all good, not great, but the lead, played by Thomas Cavanagh, TV's ""Ed"", is rather exceptional, and I was greatly surprised by the depth of his acting ability that was only hinted at on his popular, but now cancelled TV show.  The script is a bit long in the tooth and  preachy about not worrying your life away, but that isn't an awful thing as there are people who do worry about far too much.  They can be exhausting to be around.Overall, the film was a satisfying experience, but not one I would watch again and certainly not one I would run out and recommend.  It was just a bit above average.  It is certainly not to everyone's taste and if you are looking for a slasher/torture-type film like ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Saw"", or expecting tons of sex and nudity as the cover art suggests, then this film isn't for you and you will be rather disappointed.",3,"Interesting, Well-Acted, But Very Predictable",1177891200,"04 30, 2007",2007,1333,"['was', 'disappointed', 'film', 'two', 'main', 'reasons', 'One', 'believe', 'marketed', 'wrong', 'crowd', 'cover', 'art', 'little', 'nothing', 'do', 'story', 'believe', 'intentionally', 'misleading', 'audiences', 'who', 'think', 'are', 'getting', 'Saw', 'type', 'film', 'Two', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'predictable', 'Then', 'Steve', 'why', 'three', 'stars', 'Well', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'inappropriately', 'marketed', 'too', 'predictable', ""n't"", 'mean', ""n't"", 'well-executed', 'interesting', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'lead', 'played', 'Thomas', 'Cavanagh', 'TV', 'Ed', 'rather', 'exceptional', 'was', 'greatly', 'surprised', 'depth', 'acting', 'ability', 'was', 'only', 'hinted', 'popular', 'now', 'cancelled', 'TV', 'show', 'script', 'bit', 'long', 'tooth', 'preachy', 'not', 'worrying', 'life', 'away', ""n't"", 'awful', 'thing', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'worry', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'exhausting', 'be', 'around.Overall', 'film', 'was', 'satisfying', 'experience', 'not', 'one', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'certainly', 'not', 'one', 'would', 'run', 'out', 'recommend', 'was', 'just', 'bit', 'above', 'average', 'certainly', 'not', 'everyone', 'taste', 'are', 'looking', 'slasher/torture-type', 'film', 'Friday', '13th', 'Saw', 'expecting', 'tons', 'sex', 'nudity', 'cover', 'art', 'then', 'film', ""n't"", 'will', 'be', 'rather', 'disappointed']",Sublime R-Rated Edition

There is hardly any comparison between the two except for a thin similarity of the out of body experience. Of course one also has to realize that unlike ""Awake"", a complete Hollywood production, ""Sublime"" isn't.

Most of the brownish tone gets all the more depressing making it look as though it was made in the 70's. Probably that was the idea but it doesn't really make an impression. The small four or five worded quick inaudible conversations from the protagonist, early on in the movie was irritating after a point. The nudity is acceptable but the obscene language went a bit too far and even unecessary for a horror movie. The psycological analysis of the main character and trying to show the white man's fear of the black man swearing profusely and doing all the killing and mutilation also felt racist. They even mention that in the movie.The only two pluses are the soundtrack and the role of Dan Gerrity as the bald man who reminded me of the head nurse in ""One flew over the Cuckoo's nest"".

This film wasn't cut to follow the standard ""start/plot/action/tidy end"" formula... It runs at the pace at which it is occurring within George's unconcious mind - full of complicated, suppressed ideas & fears, & irrational cross-associations between what he knows to be fact & what his mind believes to be happening in reality.It plays out the way it plays out. The pace is jerky, jumbled & slow at various times, but I believe this was intentional and integral to pulling you into the story and allowing you to experience life as George does (in his current state). You thought it was too LONG? I'm sure George did too, but he was as helpless as you were. Get it?I also found the end (of the movie anyway) quite disturbing, too. Perhaps I would do the same. I don't know.This is not one of your typical films cranked out by the ""Hollywood movie machine"". I was still contemplating this one long after watching it. I like that.THIS IS A KEEPER!
