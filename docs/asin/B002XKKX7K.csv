We deserved to see them walk under the swords of their fellow officers...heck, they did it for Bud and Harriet (season 4, me thinks.)

1297698,A3NW2MN6JH8OL3,B002XKKX7K,Almost 50 Lassie fan,"[6, 8]","I borrowed a friend's videotapes to see the rest of the series. Until this price drops at least another $10, I won't be buying this. I own 8 of the JAG seasons, and I love the show. It is sad that the standards of the show fell so horrifically the last season. The man who replaced Jackson's Chegwidden simply lacks Jackson's strong actor's personality (THIS man was in Band of Brothers as the man who turned Dick Winters transfer to Japan down, and he was fine in that, but here, he seems lackluster.). The show always had immense humor, some of which was at its best during the Mic Brumby shows. Little of that here in episodes. Little money was spent on soundtrack (witness the weak music track for the last two shows ever made here) and less money spent on sets. The room where Mac and Harm learn, in the 2nd to last episode, of their transfers to San Diego and London looks like four, colorless stage flats thrown together, with pale paint. Period. Contrast that with the luxurious conference rooms Chegwidden always had during his years. It as though the producers knew the show was ending, so why bother putting money into a quality product anymore? The actors are not to blame for any of that. Content wise, the pre-Christmas show where Mac has her car accident, after talking to a psychiatrist, largely about Harm, is very fine--acting, direction, plot.  Other episodes are lacking. And I'm sorry, but anything with Vukovic or whatever young kid's name was, was beyond dull and boring. HE couldn't act, as far as I was concerned. Contrast the final episode, with Mac's engagement episode in season 6 or 7, where Chegwidden hosted the party for her and Brumby (David James Elliot directed, and the episode was called Lifeline maybe?), and you'll see the immense drop in quality.

1297704,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B002XKKX7K,D. S. Thurlow,"[0, 0]","""JAG"" was a consistently good show for most of its ten seasons, with an entertaining mixture of exciting courtroom drama, exotic adventures in and out of uniform, ward room comedy, and character romances.  If the plots were often a little (or a lot) far-fetched, the cast usually pulled it off in fine form, while the tone of the show was consistently respectful of military traditions.  ""JAG"" got a new lease on life after 9/11 opened up a whole new range of possibilities for stories.One of the consistent themes of the show was the intriguing relationship between series lead Harmon ""Harm"" Raab (David James Elliot), Navy JAG lawyer and aviator, and his Marine Corp counterpart, the fiesty and independent Sarah ""Mac"" McKenzie (Catherine Bell).  Harm and Mac were great partners on many an adventure in and out of the courtroom, and constantly on the verge of admitting to their deeper feelings for each other.  Loyal viewers waited patiently for the two to finally come together, and there were clear signs in seasons eight and nine that aviator playboy Harm had finally matured, while Sarah appeared ready for a stable relationship.All this brings us to Season Ten.  David James Elliot was on his way out of the series, and the producers sidelined his character for much of the season in favor of laying the groundwork for a reboot that would have taken Mac McKenzie to San Diego to manage a new crop of young JAG lawyers.  Prominent among the new characters was the obnoxious LT Gregory Vukovic (Chris Beetam), who tried to cut corners in the courtroom while chasing Lt Col McKenzie in a most unprofessional manner.  A new senior JAG officer changed the ward room environment at JAG headquarters, while many series mainstays were eased out the door.  This reviewer was disappointed in many of the episodes, a feeling only partially assuaged by the season and series finale, which featured Harm and Mac in a life-changing cliffhanger dilemma.If you were a long-time fan of JAG, or if you picked up the series in rerun on cable, you have to watch the final season to see how it all plays out.

1297707,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,B002XKKX7K,Gary P. Cohen,"[11, 11]","JAG was my 2nd favorite show debuting in the 1990s. (Babylon 5 was my favorite of that decade.)  I watched JAG its first season when it was stupidly cancelled by NBC until its 10th. season (after CBS picked it up and it became a massive hit, evn begating a bigger hit: NCIS.)  Of all its seasons, the 10th and final was its weakest.  There were two major reasons for this.Firstly, JAG's star David James Elliott demanded more money when his contract expired.  When it was not given to him, he signed a contract with ABC for a new comedy pilot (which never sold.)  As a result of this, the producers of JAG began phasing his character out.  There were many episodes where he only made a brief appearance.  Big mistake, as his character Harmon Rabb Jr. was the heart and soul of the show.  Secondly, they brought in a new annoying stud, Lt. Vukovich, to replace him.  Bigger mistake, especially when they stupidly had him put the moves on Colonel MacKenzie.  This was doubly idiotic  and in sort of bad taste since everyone who watched the show was well aware that Harm and Mac were madly in love with each other.The other problem was that JAG was ""played out"" as my father used to say.  The scripts just weren't all that good anymore.  This happens to many series that are on for a very long time.  I loved ""Hawaii 5-0"" and saw every episode during its 12 year run.  However by the 10th year, 5-0 had simply run out of good scripts.  Even a change in supporting cast its final season couldn't hide the fact that the scripts were not what they once were.  Same with Mission:Impossible which ran 7 years.  I thought they simply ran out of interesting missions by the end of its 5th season.The phasing out of its star, the loss of John Jackson as the beloved boss Admiral Chigwidden who left at the end of the previous season and a lack of really good scripts resulted in a mediocre final seasonStll the last episode was fine with Harm and Mac finally getting together.  (I never got why David James Elliott has not done more since JAG's cancellation 5 years ago.  He co-starred in the second and final season of an excellent series ""Close to Home"" on CBS and did some silly mini-series, I believe, on the Sci Fi. channel.  He is an excellent ""leading man"" and I'm surprised he never tried to make it on the big screen.)Anyway, JAG was a truly excellent series and I miss it.  Since it has been off for 5 years, I think its time for CBS (or one of the other networks) to start producing some ""Return to JAG"" 2 hour tv movies the way they have done over the years with ""Rockford Files,"" ""Perry Mason,"" ""Gunsmoke"" and many other classic series.

And I'm sure other folks are now going thru painful JAG withdrawal, same as me, now that the final season is available on DVD, and there ain't no more after this. It's been a wait and a half for this tenth season to come out on disc, and never mind that these aren't exactly the best episodes in the series. There are enough terrific moments here to still make it a satisfying capper. And, finally, there's a resolution to that long unresolved thing between Mac & Harm. But more on that in a bit.The cases the JAG officers work on remain as topical and relevant as ever. The courtroom battles revolve around issues such as combat stress, combat high, ageism, improper psychiatric counseling, communication breakdowns in the chain of command, private contractors getting in a firefight with U.S. troops, equal rights (a female sergeant - played by professional boxer Lucia Rijker - wants to fight men in the ring), how far can you take torture to garner information, etc. For me, though, the cases are secondary to what's going on in the cast's personal lives. Bud and Petty Officer Coates are old favorites, and they're featured in several episodes. Bud, as calm and non-threatening a guy as you'll ever meet, is ordered to attend anger management classes, and that notion alone is enough to elicit a grin, if you know your Lieutenant Roberts. Later he goes up against the ""Dream Team"" of Commander Rabb and Lt. Vukovic in court, and manages to get the better of them. Since Vukovic happens to be the lead counsel of that team and an arrogant pup who likes to cut corners, this goes down very gratifyingly. This isn't A FEW GOOD MEN, and Vukovic isn't Tom Cruise.Meanwhile, Jennifer Coates, reformed thief turned indispensable yeoman to the JAG corps, is a compelling character, and I perk up whenever she's on the screen and quietly running things (doesn't hurt that she's cute, too). ""There Goes the Neighborhood"" finds Coates's past haunting her, forcing her to step out of military protocol and call on her hard-knock experiences in the streets. In ""The Sixth Juror"" Coates gets drafted as a juror on the very same case with which she'd been assisting Harm and Mac. Meanwhile, Mattie's father is more in the picture than ever and he's seeking custody of Mattie, which leaves Harm more or less out in the cold. But then something happens...""JAG: San Diego"" is another interesting episode, especially since it gives us another chance to see the enthusiastic mystery buff Lt. Graves (we first meet her in ""Automatic for the People""). This episode was intended to pave the way for a possible spin-off, except that CBS chose not to roll the dice.With David James Elliott opting to leave the show - I think he got tired of waiting for JAG to get its eleventh season pick-up - new characters were introduced. Rear Admiral Chegwidden having retired, the headquarters up in Falls Church, Virginia come rife with rumors regarding the identity of the new Judge Advocate General. The no-nonsense, don't-eff-with-me marine who ends up in the JAG chair doesn't exactly fill Commander Rabb and Colonel MacKenzie with optimism. But, bar none, the most annoying new character is Lt. ""Vic"" Vukovic, who I guess is supposed to be this charming rogue, except he comes off as weasely and really unlikable. Plenty of times, I felt myself wanting to skip over scenes involving him and, to be honest, he kinda soured me on some of the episodes. Especially since he was taking away from more time with the rest of the cast.Now I do resent that the writers strung out the audience for so long with the whole Mac & Harm ""Will they, why won't they?"" soap opera. Nine years is an exhaustive wait just for the final episode's almost perfunctory resolution, although I suppose it's better than nothing. Still, those final fifteen minutes are not nearly enough, not by far, and I do feel cheated. At least ""The Four Percent Solution"" aired a few months before that, and featured Mac's flashing back to a day spent with her shrink as they explore her very big emotional and psychological baggage. And, yes, one of the issues she's been working thru concerns Harm. Mac and Harm have been so good at internalizing their feelings that something like ""The Four Percent Solution"" is necessary, letting us know that the writers haven't forgotten one of the key elements in the show which drew in the viewers week after week.And, yes, the special feature isn't that special and, with its brevity, is barely a feature, although the sentiment passed on by David James Elliott and the cast and crew is appreciated. But, again, I feel cheated by the lack of more bonus features. Despite this and the inclusion of the shady Lt. Vukovic and also that Harm and Mac's romance is given short shrift, I'm still rating this 4 stars out of 5. Ultimately, I still love this show, great comfort television that it was.My guess, by the way, is that it's Harm who ended up retiring...",4,Fair winds and following seas... goodbye to

The new characters were awful, expecially the Vic character who was just disgusting.  The new General was a poor judge of character who though Vic was great.  Resurrection of Webb from the dead again was just to much and the unreal story arc of Mattie was over the top.  Webb should have been left dead this time and Mattie left with her father never to be heard from again.  D.Bellisario always said he would wait until the show ended to bring Harm and Mac together and he wasn't kidding but only allowing 7 1/2 minutes at the end was a diservice to the loyal fans that had watched all of those years.  He even had to ruin the final episode by having the replusive Vic monopolize half of the episode.CBS moved the show to the Friday night graveyard in Season 9 and then complained about not having the young demographic that are not home watching TV on Friday night.I have pre-ordered this only to have the complete 10 year set.

Silvia,"[91, 96]","After 9 well-recieved seasons, the 10th and final season of JAG may seem like a drag to some, unwatchable to others, or a low-quality version of the show we all knew and loved.  In my opinion, the fault of these 22 episodes lies not in the actor's ability to portray their characters, but rather in the fact that Admiral Chegwidden had retired and were introduced to too many new characters over the course of the season.This had been nothing new to JAG.  Sturgis Turner came in Season 7, Petty Officer Coates was added a year or two later as a main character.  Even Bud & Harriet came in seasons 2 & 3.  However, in Season 10, we are introduced to a new admiral, a couple new lawyers (one namely a Lt. Gregory Vukovic, who Rabb--and many fans--did't like), and so we are forced to watch new actors ""create"" their characters in the final season of an established show. Obviously, Donald P. Bellisario wanted to keep his succesful show on the air longer (especially since David James Elliott had officially stated this season would be his last).  Maybe he tried too hard.At any rate, JAG does deliver a few more entertaining episodes, and finally ends the tension between Harm & Mac in the last episode.  And although one couldn't give season 10 an A+, the show still manages to pull off a few suprises till the end.The following is a list of the final 22 episodes:1. Hail and Farewell, Part II (2)2. Corporate Raiders3. Retrial4. Whole New Ball Game5. This Just In from Baghdad6. One Big Boat7. Camp Delta8. There Goes the Neighborhood9. The Man on the Bridge10. The Four Percent Solution11.

Donald Bellisario had informed David James Elliott that his contract would not be renewed  (Elliott did not quit as was mentioned in another review).  The Vukovic character was supposed to be a new lead to carry the show forward into future seasons, but most fans hated his character.The one thing that I think was unforgiveable was not to focus the entire last episode on the Harm and Mac story.  At that point, they knew the show was canceled so why did we need to have so much time taken up with the secondary plot with Vukovic.It has also been very disapointing that there have been so few extras (if any) on the JAG DVD's.
