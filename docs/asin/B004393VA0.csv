I watched this movie last night and it's kind of a slow paced movie.  I don't mean that in a bad way because looking back on the entire plot, it had to be slow or else it wouldn't have made sense.  I wouldn't necessarily say that it's my favorite movie but it was definitely worth seeing.  I give it four stars.",4,Bridget's Review,1294272000,"01 6, 2011",2011,402,"['was', 'expecting', 'THE', 'HAUNTING', 'OF', 'AMELIA', 'be', 'horror', 'flick', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'title', 'watched', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'kind', 'slow', 'paced', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'bad', 'way', 'looking', 'back', 'entire', 'plot', 'had', 'be', 'slow', 'else', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'sense', 'would', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'say', 'favorite', 'movie', 'was', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'give', 'four', 'stars']",Haunting of Amelia

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[11, 17]","THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRACKS (inexplicably a/k/a THE HAUNTING OF AMELIA, 2008: both titles are used in the U.S. but here you see the AMELIA title is used for the DVD). Sigh. Even on cable it's shown as THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRACKS.My review is SPOILER HEAVEN - and that's your first spoiler right there. Josh has been in a coma for a decade, but you would not know it from the way he looks - which is fine, by the way. He stays where he is happiest and lives out some sort of Elizabeth Kubler-Ross existence on the edge of death. He is, in fact, the ghost of a living person whose time may or may not be nigh.The whole film consists of Josh's presence, his own little universe, which exists right along with reality. His sister and his niece discuss pulling the plug on him; his niece, a blossoming lesbian, is blossoming with the nurse who tends to Josh's comatose body in the hospital. This only works if you accept dead people thinking and acting like they did when they were alive, even though they are denizens of heaven. Or, perhaps they are not quite from the same ""undead"" regions you might think ........ Gorgeous Canadian native Brendan Fehr, an all-too-familiar-looking newcomer with hair that is deep purplish red, plays Josh. Josh has chosen to remain working in a place called Trackside, Connecticut, at a pizzeria right next to the train tracks on which his girlfriend was killed a decade earlier. He is something of a weirdo, consumed with grief and at 29, a directionless loser. But ... he's happy in his misery. The coma he's in keeps him happy, I guess.Tania Raymonde plays Amelia, a pretty little 19-year-old who suddenly appears at the pizzeria looking for work. She's the spit-and-image of Josh's dead girlfriend, who has been haunting him quite a bit in any case (ultimately because she is his dead girlfriend, arrived from heaven to take Josh with back her).At the same time, his former best friend Rusty (Chad Lindberg, PUSH) appears and begins essentially hounding him, trying to keep Josh in his sights at all times. Rusty is a pesky poltergeist, and he wants Josh to stay with him. At one point, Amelia and Rusty have a clandestine meeting, and Amelia tries to get Rusty to return to heaven with her and Josh. This film is extremely clever, not allowing us to get the slightest inkling of what is happening.It was hilarious: the first time I ever saw this, I didn't know ANYONE was supposed to be dead and could not fathom what had happened when it was all over. Even poor Josh's mother, who visits him to see how he is, is DEAD. She is trying to get him to come to HER ""neck of the woods"". Of course, he refuses.This review is my I-don't-give-a-pig's-ear-in-hell-about-spoilers. You have to have this movie explained in order to enjoy fully the brilliance of the twisted presentation. If you are lost watching it the first time, I highly recommend you ponder it and watch it carefully again, and again if need be.It has its annoying qualities, to be sure. The sound is horrific, with the usual bad dialogue pick-up, yet the whiny college radio station music is LOUD and clear. None of the logic seems askew, but I think they badly tripped up in the scenes that show the living apparently able to see and perceive the dead. Or should we call them ""the undead""?! The fact that Josh's sister is a medium only adds to the tedium.I feel the director presents a brilliant yet painful-to-endure film, hard to follow and a migraine to fathom ... even after it's over you may be scratching your head til your scalp is detached. Hopefully my review, though spoiling it, helps you through it. This film copies unnecessarily from many other movies, and I would have presented it in a completely different manner.Hence the very end, which is the one part I will leave unrevealed so you may judge for yourself. How sad ....But I won't complain too much. It took me four days to work through this story, and it was my fellow reviewer P. Johnston who actually cracked the case. Therefore you may get it spoiled all you like by reading our posted comments (vid. below, click on the ""comments"" link and read away).This won't go on my DVD shelf at all, and the wife was angry about ""these damned puzzle films you have to work out yourself, so you can't really enjoy the movie."" I half agree, but leave it to you to decide for yourself.Remember, there's nothing grateful about being dead.",1,"The Haunting of My Patience, or, The Other Side of My Gastric Distress",1295827200,"01 24, 2011",2011,4397,"['OTHER', 'SIDE', 'THE', 'TRACKS', 'inexplicably', 'THE', 'HAUNTING', 'OF', 'AMELIA', '2008', 'titles', 'are', 'used', 'U.S.', 'here', 'see', 'AMELIA', 'title', 'used', 'DVD', 'Sigh', 'Even', 'cable', 'shown', 'THE', 'OTHER', 'SIDE', 'THE', 'TRACKS.My', 'review', 'SPOILER', 'HEAVEN', 'first', 'spoiler', 'right', 'there', 'Josh', 'been', 'coma', 'decade', 'would', 'not', 'know', 'way', 'fine', 'way', 'where', 'happiest', 'out', 'sort', 'Elizabeth', 'Kubler-Ross', 'existence', 'edge', 'death', 'fact', 'ghost', 'living', 'person', 'time', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'nigh.The', 'whole', 'film', 'Josh', 'presence', 'own', 'little', 'universe', 'right', 'along', 'reality', 'sister', 'niece', 'discuss', 'pulling', 'plug', 'niece', 'blossoming', 'lesbian', 'blossoming', 'nurse', 'who', 'Josh', 'comatose', 'body', 'hospital', 'only', 'accept', 'dead', 'people', 'thinking', 'acting', 'did', 'when', 'were', 'alive', 'even', 'are', 'denizens', 'heaven', 'perhaps', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'undead', 'regions', 'might', 'think', '..', 'Gorgeous', 'Canadian', 'native', 'Brendan', 'Fehr', 'all-too-familiar-looking', 'newcomer', 'hair', 'deep', 'purplish', 'red', 'Josh', 'Josh', 'chosen', 'remain', 'working', 'place', 'called', 'Trackside', 'Connecticut', 'pizzeria', 'right', 'next', 'train', 'tracks', 'girlfriend', 'was', 'killed', 'decade', 'earlier', 'something', 'weirdo', 'consumed', 'grief', '29', 'directionless', 'loser', 'happy', 'misery', 'coma', 'keeps', 'happy', 'guess.Tania', 'Raymonde', 'plays', 'Amelia', 'pretty', 'little', '19-year-old', 'who', 'suddenly', 'pizzeria', 'looking', 'work', 'spit-and-image', 'Josh', 'dead', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'been', 'haunting', 'quite', 'bit', 'case', 'ultimately', 'dead', 'girlfriend', 'arrived', 'heaven', 'take', 'Josh', 'back', '.At', 'same', 'time', 'former', 'best', 'friend', 'Rusty', 'Chad', 'Lindberg', 'PUSH', 'essentially', 'hounding', 'trying', 'keep', 'Josh', 'sights', 'times', 'Rusty', 'pesky', 'poltergeist', 'Josh', 'stay', 'one', 'point', 'Amelia', 'Rusty', 'have', 'clandestine', 'meeting', 'Amelia', 'tries', 'get', 'Rusty', 'return', 'heaven', 'Josh', 'film', 'extremely', 'clever', 'not', 'allowing', 'get', 'slightest', 'inkling', 'what', 'happening.It', 'was', 'hilarious', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'saw', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'ANYONE', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'dead', 'could', 'not', 'fathom', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'when', 'was', 'Even', 'poor', 'Josh', 'mother', 'who', 'see', 'how', 'DEAD', 'trying', 'get', 'come', 'HER', 'neck', 'woods', 'course', 'review', ""I-don't-give-a-pig's-ear-in-hell-about-spoilers"", 'have', 'have', 'movie', 'explained', 'order', 'enjoy', 'fully', 'brilliance', 'twisted', 'presentation', 'are', 'lost', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'highly', 'recommend', 'ponder', 'watch', 'carefully', 'again', 'again', 'need', 'be.It', 'annoying', 'qualities', 'be', 'sure', 'sound', 'horrific', 'usual', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'pick-up', 'whiny', 'college', 'radio', 'station', 'music', 'LOUD', 'clear', 'None', 'logic', 'askew', 'think', 'badly', 'tripped', 'up', 'scenes', 'show', 'living', 'apparently', 'able', 'see', 'perceive', 'dead', 'should', 'call', 'undead', 'fact', 'Josh', 'sister', 'medium', 'only', 'tedium.I', 'feel', 'director', 'brilliant', 'yet', 'painful-to-endure', 'film', 'hard', 'follow', 'migraine', 'fathom', 'even', 'may', 'be', 'scratching', 'head', 'scalp', 'detached', 'Hopefully', 'review', 'spoiling', 'film', 'copies', 'unnecessarily', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'would', 'have', 'presented', 'completely', 'different', 'manner.Hence', 'very', 'end', 'one', 'part', 'will', 'leave', 'unrevealed', 'so', 'may', 'judge', 'How', 'sad', '.But', 'wo', ""n't"", 'complain', 'too', 'much', 'took', 'four', 'days', 'work', 'story', 'was', 'fellow', 'reviewer', 'P.', 'Johnston', 'who', 'actually', 'cracked', 'case', 'may', 'get', 'spoiled', 'reading', 'posted', 'comments', 'vid', 'click', 'comments', 'link', 'read', 'away', '.This', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'DVD', 'shelf', 'wife', 'was', 'angry', 'damned', 'puzzle', 'films', 'have', 'work', 'out', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'half', 'agree', 'leave', 'decide', 'yourself.Remember', 'nothing', 'grateful', 'being', 'dead']",Haunting of Amelia
