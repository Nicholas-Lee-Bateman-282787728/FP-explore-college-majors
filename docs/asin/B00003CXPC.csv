This is one such, about a young English boy from a striking coal mining family who defies his father's prejudice against dancing (""It's all poofs, you know."") to learn ballet. In fact, he learns from Mrs. Weasley, in a way. That is, the actress who plays his teacher also plays Molly Weasley in the Harry Potter series. In fact, the two characters have a lot in common. Kind-hearted but tough and not into taking any BS from anyone.The plot is a little thin and pretty predictable, but the kid is very appealing and the story is well told. I've been trying to think what my favorite scene is, and I guess it is his audition for the Royal Ballet School. He's so nervous he takes a minute to get started, but then he flies! He shows the panel he can do a huge variety of moves very well, and there they sit, trying to keep straight faces. I guess the British are better at that than I'm accustomed to, but there's a recognizable look of astonishment on several faces.But the last question they ask him really made it for me: ""Billy, what does it feel like when you are dancing?"" He's not very articulate, but gradually he warms up to the description, and we find that he's almost a poet as well as a dancer. He's a likeable kid, and you feel good for him when he gets admitted to the school.

531478,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B00003CXPC,C. B Collins Jr.,"[2, 2]","As a hint as to the high quality of this excellent film, notice that this film has a higher proportion of '5' scores among a large number of raters than the vast majority of films. It is a very well crafted piece of art.The film is about the human spirit and the motivations to excel and to experience life fully. Billy is a young boy who becomes entranced with dance, an art form that allows him to express his emotions and experience a deeper connection with himself. He is reared in a working class neighborhood with a rough father and older brother, both of whom are miners on strike. Billy's mother has died and this boy interested in dance must survive in a highly tense highly aggressive home and neighborhood. Jamie Bell plays the role to perfection and deserves incredible credit for being able to carry off this lead role with such fine acting skills and ability to become the character Billy Elliot before our eyes.The film is also about his dance teacher and mentor, played perfectly by the wonderful actress Julie Walters. She is the perfect mentor, pressing the student when he needs to be pressed but recognizing that for every step she takes, he must also make a step.  The best mentors know that they can't do it for the mentee. Walters is an incredible actress, being able to be vulnerable and controlled at the same time. She recognizes that the role she has taken on in regard to Billy's budding talent is that of protector and teacher and that at some point he will move beyond her if her work is done. Walters embodies and channels this aspect of the mentor perfectly.Gary Lewis is superb as Jackie Elliot, Billy's father. He plays a middle aged coal miner, still in grief over the loss of his wife, trying to make ends meet in a home with two sons. At first Jackie is furious that his son wants to become a dancer, but gradually the father sees the hopelessness that he and his older son experience as miners on strike, and supports his son in following his passion and breaking into a new world of opportunities and experiences.Excellent in every way, this tale is about the growth of the human spirit but thoughtfully explores the roles of those who facilitate that growth.",5,Joyful is the best description,1193875200,"11 1, 2007",2007,2198,"['hint', 'high', 'quality', 'excellent', 'film', 'notice', 'film', 'higher', 'proportion', '5', 'scores', 'large', 'number', 'raters', 'vast', 'majority', 'films', 'very', 'well', 'crafted', 'piece', 'art.The', 'film', 'human', 'spirit', 'motivations', 'excel', 'experience', 'life', 'fully', 'Billy', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'entranced', 'dance', 'art', 'form', 'express', 'emotions', 'experience', 'deeper', 'connection', 'reared', 'working', 'class', 'neighborhood', 'rough', 'father', 'older', 'brother', 'whom', 'are', 'miners', 'strike', 'Billy', 'mother', 'died', 'boy', 'interested', 'dance', 'must', 'survive', 'highly', 'tense', 'highly', 'aggressive', 'home', 'neighborhood', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'role', 'perfection', 'incredible', 'credit', 'being', 'able', 'carry', 'off', 'lead', 'role', 'such', 'fine', 'acting', 'skills', 'ability', 'become', 'character', 'Billy', 'Elliot', 'eyes.The', 'film', 'also', 'dance', 'teacher', 'mentor', 'played', 'perfectly', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'perfect', 'mentor', 'pressing', 'student', 'when', 'be', 'pressed', 'recognizing', 'step', 'must', 'also', 'make', 'step', 'best', 'mentors', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'mentee', 'Walters', 'incredible', 'actress', 'being', 'able', 'be', 'vulnerable', 'controlled', 'same', 'time', 'role', 'taken', 'regard', 'Billy', 'budding', 'talent', 'protector', 'teacher', 'point', 'will', 'move', 'work', 'done', 'Walters', 'embodies', 'channels', 'aspect', 'mentor', 'perfectly.Gary', 'Lewis', 'superb', 'Jackie', 'Elliot', 'Billy', 'father', 'middle', 'aged', 'coal', 'miner', 'still', 'grief', 'loss', 'wife', 'trying', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'home', 'two', 'sons', 'first', 'Jackie', 'furious', 'son', 'become', 'dancer', 'gradually', 'father', 'hopelessness', 'older', 'son', 'experience', 'miners', 'strike', 'son', 'following', 'passion', 'breaking', 'new', 'world', 'opportunities', 'experiences.Excellent', 'way', 'tale', 'growth', 'human', 'spirit', 'thoughtfully', 'roles', 'who', 'facilitate', 'growth']",N/A

I frankly don't know where to start with,,  The story itself is pretty interesting;a british boy, who lives in this small coal mining town with intensified strikes going on, happens to find his hidden talent as a ballet dancer.It is a very powerful movie because it gives out this inspiration, motivation, little push to change your life if you are caught up with the situation/circumstances.  I'm not joking here, but I literally packed all of my video games and systems (which happen to be my precious collection over years) to sell them and move on to be a determined law school student,,(which ended up in unpacking everything i've packed..it was so close though,,).  I mean, I could never ever picture myself throwing away my precious game collections, but this movie actually persuaded me to throw them away to dance for my own dream, almost.  This movie shows a burning desire of a boy, (hold it right there!) you see, do you know what it feels like to have that burning desire? that you wanna do something so bad yet you are strained by your own family,,  This movie did an excellent job on building/developing the struggle by Billy with the family, outside, and himself.  man,, this boy surely knows how to dance,,let me tell you that-  (I'm seriously considering of registering a dance class, though i'm not much of a dancer)I absolutely agree with the other reviewer who said that this movie was overlooked during Oscar ceremony.  I don't know about you, but i couldn't understand why the Billy Elliot wasn't picked as a best movie, well at least it's better than Gladiator.  This already maginificient movie with struggling, dancing, maturing boy, is again solidified with the father's decision to sacrifice himself utterly, i mean utterly and vague touch of Billy's gay friend, who adds more to the depth of the story with this faint scent of nostalgia.Aaahh(sigh),, I literally watched his dancing scenes more than,, i don't even remember,,  But this boy, who wants to be a ballet dancer, will either make you cry with tears of determination or give that warmth that you haven't felt for a long time.Hey people, dance like Billy, dance like Billy to go forth to reach for your dream regardless of the struggle, obstacle, and circumstances,, if Billy can do it, then you and I can do it  =)",5,"Man,,this boy knows how to DANCE!!",993859200,"06 30, 2001",2001,2483,"['gosh', 'Billy', 'Billy', 'Billy', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'too', 'much', 'when', 'picked', 'one', 'BlockBuster', 'not', 'only', 'watched', '3', 'times', 'row', 'also', 'purchased', 'day', 'rent', 'frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'start', 'story', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'british', 'boy', 'who', 'small', 'coal', 'mining', 'town', 'intensified', 'strikes', 'going', 'find', 'hidden', 'talent', 'ballet', 'dancer.It', 'very', 'powerful', 'movie', 'out', 'inspiration', 'motivation', 'little', 'push', 'change', 'life', 'are', 'caught', 'up', 'situation/circumstances', ""'m"", 'not', 'joking', 'here', 'literally', 'packed', 'video', 'games', 'systems', 'happen', 'be', 'precious', 'collection', 'years', 'sell', 'move', 'be', 'determined', 'law', 'school', 'student', 'ended', 'up', 'unpacking', 'everything', 'i', ""'ve"", 'packed..it', 'was', 'so', 'close', 'mean', 'could', 'never', 'ever', 'picture', 'throwing', 'away', 'precious', 'game', 'collections', 'movie', 'actually', 'persuaded', 'throw', 'away', 'dance', 'own', 'dream', 'almost', 'movie', 'burning', 'desire', 'boy', 'hold', 'right', 'there', 'see', 'do', 'know', 'what', 'have', 'burning', 'desire', 'wan', 'do', 'something', 'so', 'bad', 'yet', 'are', 'strained', 'own', 'family', 'movie', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'building/developing', 'struggle', 'Billy', 'family', 'outside', 'man', 'boy', 'surely', 'how', 'dance', ',let', 'tell', 'that-', ""'m"", 'seriously', 'considering', 'registering', 'dance', 'class', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'dancer', 'absolutely', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'overlooked', 'Oscar', 'ceremony', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'i', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Billy', 'Elliot', 'was', ""n't"", 'picked', 'best', 'movie', 'well', 'least', 'better', 'Gladiator', 'already', 'maginificient', 'movie', 'struggling', 'dancing', 'maturing', 'boy', 'again', 'solidified', 'father', 'decision', 'sacrifice', 'utterly', 'i', 'mean', 'utterly', 'vague', 'touch', 'Billy', 'gay', 'friend', 'who', 'more', 'depth', 'story', 'faint', 'scent', 'nostalgia.Aaahh', 'sigh', 'literally', 'watched', 'dancing', 'scenes', 'more', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'boy', 'who', 'be', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'will', 'either', 'make', 'cry', 'tears', 'determination', 'give', 'warmth', 'have', ""n't"", 'felt', 'long', 'time.Hey', 'people', 'dance', 'Billy', 'dance', 'Billy', 'go', 'forth', 'reach', 'dream', 'regardless', 'struggle', 'obstacle', 'circumstances', 'Billy', 'can', 'do', 'then', 'can', 'do', '=']",N/A

Set against the backdrop of the coalminer's strike of the late 1980's in Northern England, the film is about an adolescent boy(Jamie Bell) who wants to pursue ballet instead of more manly pursuits such as boxing despite the social and economic pressures that are against such a dream.  Jamie Bell is just luminous as Billy.  You can feel the fire that burns inside him as he pursues this dream.  My favorite scene in the film is one where he dances his frustrations out of anger with the Jam's ""A Town Called Malice"" playing on the soundtrack.  Good support is offered here by Gary Lewis as Billy's father, a widower who has the burden of raising his family and also towing the union line in the miner's strike.  Julie Walters is equally fine as Billy's sympathetic ballet teacher.  What I did like about the film is that it effectively portrayed it's sympathies for the striking miners without going over-the-top.

There are numerous small but crucial roles. The entire family, of course, is crucial, but each actor makes the most of some very brief but moving scenes. Grandma's goodbye is powerful, for example, as is the brother's hard hitting performance as the committed striker. The father is magnificent, really perfect. The teacher gives a rather restrained performance. She is very good, though, especially with the cigarette ever dangling, which she makes a critical prop in the development of her character.

Her daughter, too, is rather good, although she disappears more or less, and is replaced by the gay neighborhood boy who comes many years later to see Billy dance in ""Swan Lake"".

(This seems to be a characteristic of many British films)Some reviewer I've read calls it (the whole story)  &#34;funny.&#34;  I tend to disagree.  There are certainly many scenes which are downright  funny. The action overall is handled with a very light, easily watched spirit - only one brief scene approaches intense drama.

In this case, a boy's father (a man's man miner) scrimps and saves during hard times (a mining strike) to send his son to boxing lessons. The son instead discovers he is both more interested in and has a talent for ballet and uses his father's money for ballet lessons, lying to his father about what he is doing. When it becomes clear that his talent goes well beyond what the teaching in their northern English town can offer, Billy's instructor suggests that he apply to study in London. Family problems thus ensue, with both Billy's father and brother (both striking miners and ""macho"") criticizing Billy, barring Billy from this ""homosexual way of life"", etc. In the end, Billy triumphs, perhaps because his talent is too great to deny, perhaps because his father finally sees that this a ticket for Billy to avoid the kind of hard and uncertain life he has had to endure.",4,hard to see beyond the depressing backdrop,1111622400,"03 24, 2005",2005,1420,"['British', 'film', 'much', 'many', 'other', 'contemporary', 'British', 'films', 'billed', 'comedies', 'Full', 'Monty', 'Brassed', 'Off', 'chronicle', 'even', 'backdrop', 'dying', 'industry', 'layoffs', 'unemployment', 'labor', 'problems', 'truly', 'depressing', 'things', 'first', 'viewing', 'films', 'am', 'struck', 'more', 'palpable', 'sense', 'hopelessness', 'background', 'even', 'main', 'story', 'film', 'meant', 'be', 'hopeful', 'Depressing', 'circumstances', 'take', 'several', 'attempts', 'get', 'past', 'order', 'see', 'funny', 'heartwarming', 'story', 'case', 'boy', 'father', 'man', 'man', 'miner', 'scrimps', 'saves', 'hard', 'times', 'mining', 'strike', 'send', 'son', 'boxing', 'lessons', 'son', 'instead', 'discovers', 'more', 'interested', 'talent', 'ballet', 'father', 'money', 'ballet', 'lessons', 'lying', 'father', 'what', 'doing', 'When', 'clear', 'talent', 'well', 'what', 'teaching', 'northern', 'English', 'town', 'can', 'offer', 'Billy', 'instructor', 'apply', 'study', 'London', 'Family', 'problems', 'thus', 'ensue', 'Billy', 'father', 'brother', 'striking', 'miners', 'macho', 'criticizing', 'Billy', 'barring', 'Billy', 'homosexual', 'way', 'life', 'etc', 'end', 'Billy', 'perhaps', 'talent', 'too', 'great', 'deny', 'perhaps', 'father', 'finally', 'ticket', 'Billy', 'avoid', 'kind', 'hard', 'uncertain', 'life', 'had', 'endure']",N/A

Bragg ""--Braggeroni""","[3, 3]","I was a ballet and dance performer in high school when this film first came out, and it struck me as one of the most genuine movies since.Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell) is part of a family that, without a mother, flows with strong masculine influence; he takes boxing lessons regularly by his fathers influence, but young Billy seems to be unable to connect with the sport.  Once he discovers the ballet class of a schoolmate, he begins to practice with them, awakening a passion inside of him that would guide him through trial and tribulation before he can share this joy with the world around him.This film is honest in several key areas.  When I was in school, it was expected of me to play football or wrestling, as opposed to ballet in dance.  My typical rebuttal would be that it is better to spend evenings around girls in tights then on football fields grabbing other men.  For me it was a sense of humor that allowed me to consider my passion ""normal,"" but young Elliot cannot define his passion, even by the end of the film.When asked at the conclusion of his audition for the Royal Ballet School, ""what does it feel like, when you're dancing?"" He responds ""I don't know."" Sensing the dissatisfaction of the panel which will determine if he can enter the school, he tries to define it as best he can.  Speaking from experience, there are some passions that are simply so truely and deply a part of you that you cannot simply ""justify"" them with words, they are simply a part of you.This film is true and honest to that passion; for ballet enthusiasts, you'll immediately understand the ""political"" development around what is ""normal"" for a young ballet performer.  As a non-influenced audiencemember, you're bound to appreciate every conflict, frustration, denial and accomplishment that is so masterfully displayed on screen.

Even more amazing is the acting debut of Jamie Bell in the title role. Rumor has it that some 2000 young boys were ruled out first, but it's a wonder anyone was found who met the criteria at all. Despite his youth, Bell gives a top-notch performance as both a dancer AND an actor.This is a story of a family in a mining town in north England during a strike in 1984. Billy's Dad and older brother are both miners, and his Mom is recently deceased. Billy has been enrolled in boxing lessons, but takes an interest in the ballet class across the gym, and the dance instructor quickly picks up on this. Inevitable conflicts ensue, etc. That's enough plot information; I'm just here to tell you that everyone involved in ""Billy Elliot"" contributed their best efforts to make it a fine film, and succeeded. In addition to the aforementioned Daldry and Bell, there is Jamie Draven as Billy's brother Tony, Gary Lewis as Billy's father, and Julie Walters as his dance teacher. The movie contains drama without sensationalism, much humor, and of course music and dance; something for everyone.There is some coarse language, but it's not gratuitous.

531508,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00003CXPC,"""flickjunkie""","[3, 5]","I was prepared to love this film when I read the descriptions, and with one minor exception, my wish was fulfilled.  This is a compelling story of a young boy's courage to pursue his dream, despite its being completely antithetical to the cultural expectations of the town in which he lived.  In a mining town, where men are men, Billy (Jamie Bell) slips away each night after boxing practice to learn ballet with the girls.  In spite of enormous social pressure and a disapproving father, Billy persists in his dream to become a ballet dancer and emerges triumphant.This is a story that is less about dance than it is about social interaction.  The incredible pressure to be what one is expected to be is pitted elegantly against the unyielding desire to pursue one's ambitions.  Also woven into the story are various themes about people who are different and how they handle being on the fringe.  The film does an excellent job of developing various characters and making us love them, foibles and all.My only reservation is that the film overemphasized certain of the human stories (particularly the minors' strike) at the expense of the dance.  We see glimpses of Billy's progress as a dancer, but he seems to explode from spastic and gawky to an accomplished tap artist with little transition.  Also, there seems to be a disconnect between his exceptional tap skills and his tentative ballet skills, which is so discrepant that it is hard to believe it is the same dancer.  While the dance theme is clearly subordinate to the human issues, I felt it should have been more believable and better developed to complete the film.Not much more could have been asked of Jamie Bell in this role.  In his film debut he is mesmerizing, both in his acting and dance performances.  Bell always found exactly the right emotion to portray Billy's conflicts, disappointments and stubborn persistence.  Bell is the keystone that holds the entire film together and he is the reason it succeeds so completely.The ensemble supporting Bell is also first rate as is the direction of Stephen Daldry.  Daldry gives the story that quaint small town British feel, full of brutal honesty and simple human truths.  Daldry's greatest success is in the pure sincerity of the actors' performances making every frame realistic and convincing, and earning him an Oscar nomination for best director in only his second film.  Julie Walters, also nominated for best supporting actress, does a fine job as the tough and determined ballet teacher, and Gary Lewis gives a standout performance as Billy's dad.This is an inspirational film that is just a hair short of perfect.  I rated it a 9/10.  With a little better development of the dance theme it might have been flawless.  Nonetheless, it is one of the most compelling and uplifting films of the year with a positive and upbeat message that is sure to capture your heart.",5,Almost flawless,998438400,"08 22, 2001",2001,2895,"['was', 'prepared', 'love', 'film', 'when', 'read', 'descriptions', 'one', 'minor', 'exception', 'wish', 'was', 'fulfilled', 'compelling', 'story', 'young', 'boy', 'courage', 'pursue', 'dream', 'being', 'completely', 'antithetical', 'cultural', 'expectations', 'town', 'lived', 'mining', 'town', 'where', 'men', 'are', 'men', 'Billy', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'away', 'night', 'boxing', 'practice', 'learn', 'ballet', 'girls', 'spite', 'enormous', 'social', 'pressure', 'disapproving', 'father', 'Billy', 'dream', 'become', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'triumphant.This', 'story', 'less', 'dance', 'social', 'interaction', 'incredible', 'pressure', 'be', 'what', 'one', 'expected', 'be', 'pitted', 'elegantly', 'unyielding', 'desire', 'pursue', 'one', 'ambitions', 'Also', 'woven', 'story', 'are', 'various', 'themes', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'different', 'how', 'handle', 'being', 'fringe', 'film', 'excellent', 'job', 'developing', 'various', 'characters', 'making', 'love', 'foibles', 'only', 'reservation', 'film', 'overemphasized', 'certain', 'human', 'stories', 'particularly', 'minors', 'strike', 'expense', 'dance', 'see', 'glimpses', 'Billy', 'progress', 'dancer', 'explode', 'spastic', 'gawky', 'accomplished', 'tap', 'artist', 'little', 'transition', 'Also', 'be', 'disconnect', 'exceptional', 'tap', 'skills', 'tentative', 'ballet', 'skills', 'so', 'discrepant', 'hard', 'believe', 'same', 'dancer', 'dance', 'theme', 'clearly', 'subordinate', 'human', 'issues', 'felt', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'believable', 'better', 'developed', 'complete', 'film.Not', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'asked', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'role', 'film', 'debut', 'mesmerizing', 'acting', 'dance', 'performances', 'Bell', 'always', 'found', 'exactly', 'right', 'emotion', 'portray', 'Billy', 'conflicts', 'disappointments', 'stubborn', 'persistence', 'Bell', 'keystone', 'entire', 'film', 'together', 'reason', 'so', 'completely.The', 'ensemble', 'supporting', 'Bell', 'also', 'first', 'rate', 'direction', 'Stephen', 'Daldry', 'Daldry', 'story', 'quaint', 'small', 'town', 'British', 'feel', 'full', 'brutal', 'honesty', 'simple', 'human', 'truths', 'Daldry', 'greatest', 'success', 'pure', 'sincerity', 'actors', 'performances', 'making', 'frame', 'realistic', 'convincing', 'earning', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'best', 'director', 'only', 'second', 'film', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'also', 'nominated', 'best', 'supporting', 'actress', 'fine', 'job', 'tough', 'determined', 'ballet', 'teacher', 'Gary', 'Lewis', 'standout', 'performance', 'Billy', 'dad.This', 'inspirational', 'film', 'just', 'hair', 'short', 'perfect', 'rated', '9/10', 'little', 'better', 'development', 'dance', 'theme', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'flawless', 'Nonetheless', 'one', 'most', 'compelling', 'uplifting', 'films', 'year', 'positive', 'upbeat', 'message', 'sure', 'capture', 'heart']",N/A

531511,A3M5O6UHXO9IBU,B00003CXPC,Gary,"[6, 68]","One does try as hard as one can to avoid the working classes, although poverty and lack of transport make this problematic.  If curiosity about how they actually live their lives gets the better of one then what safer way than home video?  My last such glimpse into a strange and unfamiliar world was through Ken Loach's 'Kes', in which a frustrated and alienated young boy, cowed by an aggressive brother and the uncertainty of a benighted future down the pits, discovers that his best friend is a Kestrel.  Quickly crushing any aesthesia brought on by Loach's compassion for the great unwashed, it has taken the hyperbol surrounding 'Billy Elliot' to take me less than expeditiously down memory lane once more.  How have the lives of the working classes changed thirty years on?  Apparently they sleep two to a bedroom instead of six as I had once erroneously supposed and have inside toilets.  When a solitary worker has the temerity to want to do a day's work he is chased through a succession of working class dwellings by fifty riot police in full regalia until caught.  It's gratifying to see such a realistic prioritizing of police resources on film and the comforting knowledge of the tax payer's money well spent.  Apart from that, little has changed except for one egrigious detail.  Your actual working classes pirouette down the high street. Billy Elliot, a frustrated and alienated young boy cowed by an aggressive brother and the uncertainty of a benighted future down the pits, discovers that his best friend is a ballet tutu.  Also, his second best friend just might be a transvestite.  This irresponsibility on the part of the British film industry should not go unanswered.  This is not Hampstead.  Encouraging the lower orders to experience culture only leads to books, and books lead to union membership and then (God help us) secret ballots. I think the need to appeal to the American market has reared it's capitulant head here.  Pleas for sexual tolerance and finding your inner child are more important than a roof over one's head and the dignity of (hard) labour.  Kestrels are aggressive, macho symbols that may lower the tone and pull a boy's false eye lashes off.  Of course, we must take all these changes on trust, but how accurate is this to real working class lives?  Unlike the ending to 'Kes' which leaves the audience basking in the warm glow of their own undoubtedly justified prejudices, 'Billy Elliot' leaves us suspicious and distrustful at it's challenge to the natural order.  Yes, we may let the odd one escape to become rock musicians, sportsman and soap stars, but let us not get carried away.  This is an American fortune cookie, not OUR Britain, thank you very much.Now, one may be prepared to sit through working class life when the film making calibre of Ken Loach is involved, but when confronted by the almost obdurately dire artistic decisions and cack direction of Stephen Daldry, the urge to hit the off switch is overwhelming.  There are, no doubt, worse experiences one might be subjected to in one's drawing room than 'Billy Elliot' such as listening to pibroch while having your leg chewed off by a shark, but it's a close run thing.  It may be in the unlikely event prejudice (heaven forbid), but I thought this film was quite staggeringly, fall off Ben Nevis bad.  It's jocund liveliness cannot hide it's jejunity (and trying saying that fast, I guarantee it will be more comprehensible than 'Billy Elliot'). And if I have to endure one more scene in which a minor turns to another minor (as opposed to a miner) and after a long pause says &quot;do you want to play hide the salami with me&quot; or words to that effect, I shall emigrate to Botswana and I don't even know where that is.  Do contemporary writers think this is cute and cuddly coming from children, as opposed to deeply creepy put in their mouths by an adult?  May I suggest that in an act of charity not dissimilar to their salt of the earth goodness depicted in 'Billy Elliot', our actual working classes band together to confer on the writer Mr Hall, the useful and life changing gift of an escritoire?",1,Nay a thousand times 't nay,998438400,"08 22, 2001",2001,4130,"['One', 'try', 'as', 'hard', 'one', 'can', 'avoid', 'working', 'classes', 'poverty', 'lack', 'transport', 'make', 'problematic', 'curiosity', 'how', 'actually', 'live', 'lives', 'better', 'one', 'then', 'what', 'safer', 'way', 'home', 'video', 'last', 'such', 'glimpse', 'strange', 'unfamiliar', 'world', 'was', 'Ken', 'Loach', ""'Kes"", 'frustrated', 'alienated', 'young', 'boy', 'cowed', 'aggressive', 'brother', 'uncertainty', 'benighted', 'future', 'down', 'pits', 'discovers', 'best', 'friend', 'Kestrel', 'Quickly', 'crushing', 'aesthesia', 'brought', 'Loach', 'compassion', 'great', 'unwashed', 'taken', 'hyperbol', 'surrounding', ""'Billy"", 'Elliot', 'take', 'less', 'expeditiously', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'once', 'more', 'How', 'have', 'lives', 'working', 'classes', 'changed', 'thirty', 'years', 'Apparently', 'sleep', 'two', 'bedroom', 'instead', 'six', 'had', 'once', 'erroneously', 'supposed', 'have', 'inside', 'toilets', 'When', 'solitary', 'worker', 'temerity', 'want', 'do', 'day', 'work', 'chased', 'succession', 'working', 'class', 'dwellings', 'fifty', 'riot', 'police', 'full', 'regalia', 'caught', 'gratifying', 'see', 'such', 'realistic', 'prioritizing', 'police', 'resources', 'film', 'comforting', 'knowledge', 'tax', 'payer', 'money', 'well', 'spent', 'Apart', 'little', 'changed', 'one', 'egrigious', 'detail', 'actual', 'working', 'classes', 'pirouette', 'high', 'street', 'Billy', 'Elliot', 'frustrated', 'alienated', 'young', 'boy', 'cowed', 'aggressive', 'brother', 'uncertainty', 'benighted', 'future', 'down', 'pits', 'discovers', 'best', 'friend', 'ballet', 'tutu', 'Also', 'second', 'best', 'friend', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'transvestite', 'irresponsibility', 'part', 'British', 'film', 'industry', 'should', 'not', 'go', 'unanswered', 'not', 'Hampstead', 'Encouraging', 'lower', 'orders', 'experience', 'culture', 'only', 'books', 'books', 'lead', 'union', 'membership', 'then', 'God', 'help', 'secret', 'ballots', 'think', 'need', 'appeal', 'American', 'market', 'reared', 'capitulant', 'head', 'here', 'Pleas', 'sexual', 'tolerance', 'finding', 'inner', 'child', 'are', 'more', 'important', 'roof', 'one', 'head', 'dignity', 'hard', 'labour', 'Kestrels', 'are', 'aggressive', 'macho', 'symbols', 'may', 'lower', 'tone', 'pull', 'boy', 'false', 'eye', 'lashes', 'course', 'must', 'take', 'changes', 'trust', 'how', 'accurate', 'real', 'working', 'class', 'lives', 'ending', ""'Kes"", 'audience', 'basking', 'warm', 'glow', 'own', 'undoubtedly', 'justified', 'prejudices', ""'Billy"", 'Elliot', 'suspicious', 'distrustful', 'challenge', 'natural', 'order', 'Yes', 'may', 'let', 'odd', 'one', 'escape', 'become', 'rock', 'musicians', 'sportsman', 'soap', 'stars', 'let', 'not', 'get', 'carried', 'away', 'American', 'fortune', 'cookie', 'not', 'OUR', 'Britain', 'thank', 'very', 'much.Now', 'one', 'may', 'be', 'prepared', 'sit', 'working', 'class', 'life', 'when', 'film', 'making', 'calibre', 'Ken', 'Loach', 'involved', 'when', 'confronted', 'almost', 'obdurately', 'dire', 'artistic', 'decisions', 'cack', 'direction', 'Stephen', 'Daldry', 'urge', 'hit', 'off', 'switch', 'overwhelming', 'are', 'doubt', 'worse', 'experiences', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'subjected', 'one', 'drawing', 'room', ""'Billy"", 'Elliot', 'such', 'listening', 'pibroch', 'having', 'leg', 'chewed', 'off', 'shark', 'close', 'run', 'thing', 'may', 'be', 'unlikely', 'event', 'prejudice', 'heaven', 'forbid', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'quite', 'staggeringly', 'fall', 'off', 'Ben', 'Nevis', 'bad', 'jocund', 'liveliness', 'can', 'not', 'hide', 'jejunity', 'trying', 'saying', 'fast', 'guarantee', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'comprehensible', ""'Billy"", 'Elliot', 'have', 'endure', 'one', 'more', 'scene', 'minor', 'minor', 'opposed', 'miner', 'long', 'pause', 'quot', 'do', 'want', 'play', 'hide', 'salami', 'quot', 'words', 'effect', 'shall', 'emigrate', 'Botswana', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'where', 'Do', 'contemporary', 'writers', 'think', 'cute', 'cuddly', 'coming', 'children', 'opposed', 'deeply', 'creepy', 'put', 'mouths', 'adult', 'May', 'suggest', 'act', 'charity', 'not', 'dissimilar', 'salt', 'earth', 'goodness', 'depicted', ""'Billy"", 'Elliot', 'actual', 'working', 'classes', 'band', 'together', 'confer', 'writer', 'Mr', 'Hall', 'useful', 'life', 'changing', 'gift', 'escritoire']",N/A

Billy's father (Gary Lewis) and brother (Jamie Draven) are strongly involved in the miner's strike and the future of the family and community looks bleak. Billy's father scrapes together money to send him to boxing classes, but he doesn't enjoy them and being captivated by the girl's ballet dances he transfers to the latter, while concealing this from his family.But his dance teacher, the abrasive but big hearted Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters) notices Billy's talent and is determined he should be enrolled in the Royal School of Ballet in London. The resistance of Billy's father breaks down when he see's Billy's incredible talent and he will do anything to get Billy to be able to follow his passion and have a chance at a better lifeTogether with a few gems like 'This England' this is one of the few movies to focus on Britain's ever neglected and abused white working class, betrayed first by Margaret Thatcher and then by the liberal and left middle class elit, on account of Third world immigrants and Muslims, Britain's white working class have been abused and kicked around by both conservatives and the left. Scenes of poverty, such as the little blond girl with her rag doll, who stands outside the council houses, add a gritty reality to a wonderful, heartwarming, inspiring and passionate movie. Notable scenes include the clash between Mrs Wilkinson and Billy's brother tony, when Billy runs away and shakes his body in angst and rage to the tune of 'A Town like Malice'.

There is very little that struck me as truly original, although I enjoyed the scene when Billy's elder brother is chased by police about the mining town and he simply knows that every front and back door is going to be unlocked.The choice of music for the soundtrack was bizarre -- early 70s T Rex (largely) for an early 80s movie?  But, given that most of the music of the 1980s was so dire, the choice of a deceased composer like Marc Bolan enabled the producers to get legal permission before they started filming (unlike THE BIG CHILL, for instance, where the actors are required to dance in the kitchen with no idea what tune will finally be overlaid on the soundtrack).There are one or two very touching scenes -- such as Billy showing his ballet teacher the letter from his dead mother -- and you know you've been set up for them, but they're endearing nonetheless.  I couldn't understand why Billy's Dad had such a strong Scottish accent when everyone else in the family and community spoke with the lilt of North-East England.Overall, not a great film from the production companies of Richard Curtis and Rowan Atkinson (Working Title / Tiger Aspect), but not a bad one.

I fully accept that kids use 4-letter words until they wear them out or get bored with them, but wasn't this just a tad overdone in &quot;Billy&quot;-- especially for the adults???I think what struck me most was the *reminders* of elements in other movies-- for example:*Kid yells at parent to stop beating sibling.

Jamie Bell was fantastic as Billy.Many very touching moments in the film-- the boy trying to clean the spray paint from his mom's grave marker;  the grandmother being left behind;  the father willing to be a *scab* to earn money for his son's trip;  the miners having to go back to a job at the same or even less salary (been there, done that, bought the t-shirt-- it is a lousy feeling!)

531526,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B00003CXPC,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[2, 2]","The Cortonwood Colliery in Yorkshire, UK,  closed in 1984. This was to be the first of 20 mine closures with the loss of 20,000 jobs. The UK Miners' Union responded by calling for a national strike, a major industrial action affecting the entire British coal industry. At it's height 165,000 miners were out on strike. In many communities miners' wives pushed the struggle forward, joining picket lines and arranging communal food kitchens. The Tory government used the state's resources to put more and more police into the coal fields and on the picket lines, frequently with violent and bloody consequences. After 51 weeks on strike, a special delegate conference of the National Union of Mineworkers voted by 98 to 91 votes to return to work. This was a defining moment in British industrial relations, and its defeat significantly weakened the British trade union movement. It was also seen as a major political and ideological victory for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her Conservative Party. At one point during the strike, in a speech to Tory M.P.'s, Prime Minister Thatcher stated, ""We had to fight the enemy without in the Falklands. We always have to be aware of the enemy within,"" (referring to the striking miners), ""which is much more difficult to fight and more dangerous to liberty.""It is against this grim backdrop that ""Billy Elliot"" begins. Eleven year-old Billy, (Jamie Bell), is the son of a widowed coal miner, (Gary Lewis). Their beloved wife and mother died the year before. Billy, his father, older brother, Tony, (Jamie Draven), and live-in grandmother, (Jean Heywood), reside in the fictional coal-mining town of ""Everington,"" in northeast England. The movie is actually shot in the real County Durham, UK. Billy looks after his grandmother, who has Alzheimer's, but never lets anyone forget that she could have been a professional dancer if marriage hadn't gotten in the way of her potential career. Cinematographer Brian Tufano does a magnificent job of depicting the beauty of the local, with its quaint brick houses and nearby green fields. The ocean can often be seen in the background as the characters walk through the streets. It's as if the picturesque surroundings can ameliorate the bleakness of the situation.The movie opens with Billy playing a recording of ""Cosmic Dancer"" by T-Rex. He exuberantly leaps and dances to the sound of the music as if to escape his oppressive surroundings. He deeply mourns the loss of his  ""Mum,"" and since both his Dad and brother are out on strike, the repressed anger and depression at home couldn't get much worse. As Billy runs outside to search for his wandering ""Gran,"" he sees, from the fields, a group of policemen, gathering, armed with riot shields and clubs. The threat of explosive violence is a constant throughout the movie, even with its wonderfully upbeat, and frequent comic moments.Billy takes boxing lessons at a local gym, to uphold the family tradition. Both his father and brother excel at the sport. Unfortunately, our young protagonist is not a chip off the old block, pugilistically speaking. His footwork is fabulous, but he really doesn't want to hit anyone. He is fascinated, however, by the ballet class which is being taught at the same gym. The irrepressible Billy takes a few classes, spending his 50 pence for dancing lessons rather than boxing. He even takes a book from the local library on ballet and practices the positions secretly in the bathroom. Stern, chain-smoking ballet mistress, Mrs. Wilkinson, (Julie Walters), immediately spots the boy's talent.Naturally, Billy's Dad discovers that his youngest son is not boxing. He also finds out what Billy is doing instead. Mr. Elliot is furious, and tells Billy, ""Lads do football or boxin' or wrestlin'! Not friggin' ballet!"" Billy responds, ""It's not just poofs, Dad! Some ballet dancers are as fit as athletes."" Mr. Elliot is primarily angry, however, because he believes that Billy has been wasting money. The miners are on strike and money is very scarce. He forces Billy to give up the class. But Mrs. Wilkinson continues to teach him privately, at no monetary cost. She seems to come alive while working with the budding dancer. She pours her emotions into his training, and encourages him to audition for the Royal Ballet School. The two work together rigorously...as rigorously as for boxing, wrestling or football.Billy is also encouraged by his best friend, Michael, who is having difficulties coming to grips with his own puberty - a confusing time for anyone. He is a closet cross dresser and not afraid to wear his sister's school uniform or apply make-up. Michael urges Billy to be himself and to follow his dream.The film's suspense peaks during the day of Billy's audition where multiple things happen at once - both at the dance academy and at the home front - which have a dramatic effect on Billy and his family.Director Stephen Daldry really focuses on the relationship, the strong bonds of love, between father and son. Daldry assembled a wonderful cast, which brings to life the struggles and triumphs of Lee Hall's script. Their speaking accents do take some getting used to, though. But if you're renting or own the DVD, you can always play back the initial scenes until you get used to the speech patterns. The musical/dance montages are magical. Passion and love for dance permeate the film. However, the grim political and economic circumstances surrounding the storyline are ever present. Jamie Bell is phenomenal in the title role. He gives a riveting, sensitive, dynamic performance.I just saw the theatrical production on Broadway and was curious as to how film would measure up. The show was/is extraordinary and the movie does not disappoint.Jana Perskie",5,"""Billy Elliot"" - An electrifying, uplifting film!!",1241913600,"05 10, 2009",2009,5754,"['Cortonwood', 'Colliery',

The film's so formulatic that it's really sad. There are a few early scenes that show Billy's discovery of ballet that really are something special, but even these are cross cut with shots showing the police quelling a worker's rebellion. The biggest problem with the film is that Billy is meant to stand for more than he is. He's filling in as hope for an entire community here. His dad &amp; brother are resigned to being coal workers. His teacher has a failed marriage &amp; teaches for 50 pence a lesson. His gay friend feels stifled by his homosexuality and sees Billy as the only one who understands him. His grandmother had hopes of being a pro dancer, but never got the training. Taken one by one these subplots are fine, but the accumulation of them all makes the film feel so forced that it really hurts the overall impact of Billy's dancing glories. The film achieves its successes in the small moments of personal discovery; the rest seems unnecessary.The scenes simply work much better alone than in the framework of the picture where they all combine to form mush despite the fact that there is little mush contained in them individually.

Basically, the overall plot is that if you are a guy, you don't have to be gay to dance ballet, but the story presents us with the following facts:  Billy is very uncomfortable with his girlfriend, turning down a kiss offered to him by her(and more) offering her a pillow fight as a diversion; Billy seems quite comfortable with his gay guy friend(nothing wrong with that),he even kisses him goodby near the end; Billy shows homophobia at the Royal Ballet School when a fellow male student innocently touches his hand to console him; finally, when we see Billy dancing as a professional adult, he is in a famous homoerotic version of Swan Lake.  Gee wiz, we might almost conclude that maybe the story is trying to tell us something else here.  Of course these issues are not resolved in the story.

On January 10, 2009, I saw the musical for the third time--this time in Manhattan where it was every bit as good as in London. For me it is one of the best works of the last decade. With a variety of musical styles by Elton John the stage show is a masterful production finally to be produced in the U.S. in the fall of 2008. The movie itself is a skillfully crafted work, highly original, affecting, and perfectly cast.In Billy's small mining town in northern England in the anti-labor Thatcher era, the miners are on strike. There's a heavy, oppressive police presence. The police are as much symbolic and iconic as they are real, and act as a mute chorus to the action throughout the movie. In one scene Billy is walking with a girl, and as they stroll she lightly taps the successive shields held by a line of silent, unmoving cops; the police are robotic, mechanistic, inhuman but menacing presences.Billy has the audacity to prefer ballet classes to the manly boxing classes his striking father is paying fifty p for him to attend. Jamie Bell as eleven year-old Billy is a superb dancer, who is given masculine, very original pieces to interpret. His acting is equally brilliant. The dance teacher played to the hilt by Julie Walters is a tour de force performance. There's sentimentality, but it's humanity that triumphs here.This is a brilliant, highly innovative, pioneering film.

Perez ""Jose""","[57, 58]","Jamie Bell is pure magic in this wonderful coming-0f-age film that tells the story of a working class English lad who takes up ballet as a way to hone his boxing skills.  In the process, he discovers himself, learnes some valuable life lessons, and fills a deep void left by the death of his beloved mum.  Despite his family's strong objections (and financial straits) Billy ends up studying dance from a local teacher (the effervescent Julie Walters, who won an Oscar nomination for her work here).  Her lessons - both technical and moral - serve as the basis for a devastatingly real connection between Billy and his disgusted macho father.  What ensues is a dramatic comedy that inspires us at every turn without condescension or pity.  The heartening interaction that develops between father and son is truly evocative, especially so for anyone who ever followed (or didn't) their dreams despite their family's objections.  Not only does Billy ""Dance!!"" for his supper...he befriends the local outcast gay teenager and copes with questions about his own sexual orientation - heady topics for a movie about a dancing teen.  All of this is handled in a mature, thoughtful manner, which makes the film a visceral, haunting experience.  You can take or leave it's many messages, but theere is no denying its emotional core.It's rare for a movie to challenge social mores and values by focusing on the dominant male principals.  But ""Billy Elliot"" succeeds on more levels than other underdog-come-from-behind flicks.  First, its based on a true story and resonates with truth, integrity and spirit.  And, Bell's brash, authentic portrayal is pure magic.  His feet literally take over his soul...he dances in the street, mimmicking Gene Kelly, and in the process taps his way into your heart.  The performance is so accomplished it's a wonder Bell didn't receive an Oscar nomination.  Even Russell Crowe - who won the 2000 BAFTA and Oscar for ""Gladiator"" - admitted Bell deserved the BAFTA Prize instead.  Having resisted ""Billy Elliot"" at the movies, I finally caught it recently on HBO and was taken in immediately.  This is a film your entire family can and should enjoy...if they don't, perhaps a little side trip to an English coal-mining town will help them appreciate this wonderful heartwarming film.

It certainly deserves all of its success, and should've been a Best Picture runner-up at the Oscar's 2001, but unfortunately, all it got was 3 nods. Oh, well. At least it got that, or else I would have been pouncing on the Academy!1984: In a northern England mining town, miners are on strike and the atmosphere is tense. Eleven-year old Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell), whose father (Gary Lewis) and brother (Jamie Draven) are participating in the strike, whose mother has died quite some time ago and whose grandmother is not completely aware of what's going on, doesn't like the brutal boxing lessons at school. Instead, he falls for the girls' ballet lessons. When his folks find out about this unusual love of his, Billy is in trouble. Being supported by the ballet teacher, Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters), he keeps on training secretly while the work situation as well as the problems at home get worse. Finally, Mrs. Wilkinson manages to get Billy an audition for the Royal Ballet School, but now he also has to open his heart to his family.There are heaps of shining stars in the movies that make it all worth while: Stephen Daldry, director, nominated for his extroadinary effort this year, Gary Lewis, who brutally and brilliantly displays his anger and Julie Walters who stuns our emotion every time she peeps a word. But, the film belongs to the amazingly talented Jamie Bell, he is Oscar-worthy and very natural in his role as Billy, and it hasn't been since Haley Joel Osment's performance in The Sixth Sense 2 years ago that we have seen such an engaging child actor. The film is also able to mix comedy, drama and a slight touch of romance into a very acceptable running time, and do it completely relaxed and with style.Billy Elliot is simply not to be missed!

Billy's macho father and older brother are both miners, but father wants to cross the picket line and his son is violently union and even gets arrest during one of the union protests, so there's that interplay. Billy is supposed to be taking boxing lessons, but he hates the violence and is not very good at it. He discovers a ballet class held in the same building at the same time and becomes fascinated with it. The ballet teacher agrees to him joining the class, finds that he has talent, and gives him private lessons for nothing. When Billy's father and brother find out about the ballet, things get pretty heated. Eventually, after the ballet teacher lays it on the line, telling Billy's father that Billy should try out for the Royal Ballet audition, father reluctantly gives in and the older son goes along with it. Father accompanies Billy to the audition and the interview, at which time he seems to realize how lucrative a dance career could be for Billy and that it would save him from having to toil in the mines. Although it was not alluded to in the movie, It was rather obvious that Billy received a scholarship to the Royal Ballet school because otherwise there is no way his family could afford to pay. However, there are two omissions that bother me a little. After Billy passes the audition, the next thing we see of him is as an adult going on stage as the lead male dancer in a ballet, with his father and brother in the audience, so is this the first time they've seen Billy dance or just the first time they saw him dance the lead? Also, where has Billy been all this time? Has he lived in London in a dorm for students of the Royal Ballet, has he commuted back and forth from London to his home? I know they're both small things and some of you reading this interview may think I'm nitpicking, but I'm the kind of person who doesn't like anything left hanging. It hasn't diminished my love for movie, however - I'd just like to know! By the way, that final scene, when Billy goes on stage, is magnificent.

531544,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,B00003CXPC,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[3, 3]","While I had hopes of watching this one with my family, I'm glad I watched it alone first. First of all, the parts that might keep you from sharing it with your kids - another boy who has a homo-erotic crush on young Billy Elliot (and a later scene showing this boy as a possible transvestite in adult life), some explicit cursing and some violence, etc. Depending on your comfort level with sharing (and explaining) this to your kids, you may decide to hold off sharing this film with the rest of your family. Another point - the British accents are quite thick and hard to understand at times.  As a dance film and as a coming of age story, however, I found this one among the best I've seen. Billy Elliot (played by newcomer Jamie Bell) is totally believable as a young boy in a difficult situation, his family torn apart by his mother's death and living in bleak circumstances. Billy has no talent for being a boxer, a sport his father loves. But he does have a knack for dance, a talent he discovers when he blunders his way into a dance class. Taken under the wing of the instructor (played by the inimitable Julie Walters)he begins to blossom. The dance numbers are mostly in the Fred Astaire/Gene Kelly style and Jamie Bell brings just the right amount of passion and amateurish charm to the role. He dances like no young dancer I've ever seen, actually making awkwardness engaging (no small feat). I was moved to tears when he finally stood up to his father and improvised a wild, rebellious and angry dance which left his father speechless. Julie Walters is in top form as a teacher with heart and just the right amount of firmness to handle Billy's turbulent emotions - and his family's resistance to dance.  But don't be misled into thinking this is just a dance film. Billy's entire family takes center stage in this one and his father's pain is palpable, his grief at having lost his wife and his despair at trying to make a living as a miner in a town torn apart by a mining strike.  There are few coming-of-age films which show a young boy's life in such real detail and which highlight the anguish of a young adolescent so honestly.

I was most pleased with the way the movie would have subplots that seemed not to fit with the movie (such as the miner's strike), but they would be wonderfully interwoven into the movie in a way that was thought provoking.However, I was somewhat dissapointed with the movie's handling of the homosexual issue.  While the point of the movie was that not all boys that are interested in dance, etc. are homosexuals, the movie gives the impression that all male homosexuals are interested in dance, etc.-- which I don't think to be true.  However, that aside, the movie deals with the issue of young boys and their emotions very well.  It shows that there is nothing wrong with emotionally expressive boys.  I was also impressed with the way the writer handled the family situation- the interactions between Billy, his father, his brother, and his grandmother were intense and meaningful.Overall, a movie worth seeing for anybody interested in child psychology.

With a lot of practice, Billy becomes so good that she thinks he should audition for the Royal Ballet School in London.  This would be the chance of a lifetime, but Billy's father doesn't know he's been dancing; he thinks ballet is for just for girls.I love this movie.  It is charming, honest, and uplifting.

His father considered ballet as feminine. His brother angers the ballet instructor and accuses her of scheming.

Billy's father thinks about his late wife and decides to give Billy a shot at something else, rather than a future in coal mining. Everyone in the film was perfect. The dynamics of the actors as a family was very believable.  My favorite character is the father, (Gary Lewis). He gave a very moving performance and his acting is superb.

This is the plot of this feel-good British film which has won several awards.  It has a statement to make about gender stereotypes and family love and it makes its point loud and clear.There's some fine acting in this film.  The 14-year old Jamie Bell, cast as Billy, is an excellent actor as well as a good dancer.  I immediately related to his struggle to sneak away from boxing class and study ballet in spite of the disapproval of his father and brother, striking miners who are going through struggles themselves, especially since Billy's mother has recently died.  Julie Walters plays the ballet teacher who believes in Billy, Gary Lewis plays his father, and Jean Heywood is his elderly grandmother who tends to wander away and needs to be taken care of.  Billy's young gay friend is played by Stuart Wells.  Billy is not gay and this entire subject is handled with a high degree of sensitivity.Some of the British dialog was lost on me and as I was familiar with the plot there were no surprises.  But the tension was kept up throughout with constant obstacles being put in Billy's way.  Even after he has won his father over to his side, he still has the tough examination by the Royal Ballet Academy to contend with and the audience has to sweat this out right along with Billy. I would have liked to see a bit more dancing.  What we do see is excellent but they are all solos performed without costumes.  I wish there was at least one full ensemble piece.I enjoyed this video although something holds me back from raving about it.

I enjoyed this movie enough to buy the DVD. Several scenes stick in my memory: a pillow fight between Billy and his ballet teacher's daughter, full of pubescent sexual tension; and Billy's dad, turned ""scab"" to pay for Billy's ballet career, riding the police-guarded bus through the picket lines; and Billy and his teacher dancing in the gym.The tension in Billy himself between his environment's ""boys don't do ballet"" attitudes and his own love of dancing is nicely played out. I felt everyone came around to a supportive position a little too easily and predictably, like, ""Come on, there's only a 30 minutes of this movie left, so we better gather round and drop all the negativity"", but that may be a comment on the editing rather than the acting or direction. The colours and photography were great, tho the winter scenes were so completely unconvincing it was funny! And Jamie Bell himself is brilliant - his acting even more than his dancing. This is an interesting story, about the difficulty of growing up without a mother, about breaking social and sexual expectations; it is NOT a movie about miners or politics.

On his way to a boxing lesson, he happened upon a ballet dancing class.  Soon he discovered that he was very good at ballet, and he then wanted to become a dancer despite his family's wishes.  This is a really touching and inspirational film about achieving dreams that will leave you cheering!This is easily one of the best movies I have ever seen, and I have seen quite a few considering that I'm only 14.  &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; is very similar to &quot;October Sky&quot;, which is another great movie.  (Even the kid's dad is a coal miner!)  But it is also very different in the way that it is much more complex and subtle.  I have noticed that because this is a British movie, it seems to be a lot more daring than most American movies, with a lot of things that Americans might consider extraneous.  But that's what I like about it; Every character is so well developed even if they have a very small role (e.g. Billy's supposedly gay friend).  These little aspects of these minor characters add a really nice touch to the already powerful story.Also, DON'T let the R-rating fool you.  THIS IS A FAMILY MOVIE.  This movie is NOT pornographic, or violent, or chock-full of coke-sniffing.  It just contains some language that little kids shouldn't use.  Even so, the profanity is used very maturely.  It is never gratuitous or unnecessary, it's just how these British people speak.  And the film never seems to glorify the use of such language.This film was WAY overlooked at the Oscars.  It's definitely better than &quot;Gladiator&quot;.  &quot;Gladiator&quot; may have cool combat actoin, but it's got a very straightforward plot which doesn't make you think.  I have NO IDEA why Jamie Bell wasn't nominated for his act.

531561,AAYE34TCTNV2R,B00003CXPC,MarlowesMom,"[1, 1]","The title character of ""Billy Elliot"" is a boy who dances, but the film is not really about dance. Rather, it is a beautifully-acted tale of starkly opposed forces and their painful, hard-won reconciliation.In 1984, 11-year-old Billy lives in a run-down row house in an industrial suburb of Durham, England, with his slightly senile grandmother, and his widowed father Jackie and elder brother Tony, both of whom are coal miners. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has turned the government against working people. The miners are embroiled in an increasingly violent strike. In this macho culture where the hardship of the months-long strike, economic marginalization and loss of pride have embittered working-class men, Billy discovers ballet when a white-tutu-clad group of girls begins holding their dance class in the same gymnasium as his disliked boxing lessons.The middle-class ballet teacher, Mrs. Wilkinson, sees Billy's interest and invites him to join the dance class, and he begins to learn ballet instead of boxing. Jackie, horrified to catch Billy doing ballet, forbids him to continue. Boys, Jackie says, play football, box, or wrestle. Jackie and Tony both think ballet is strictly for girls and ""poofs."" Mrs. Wilkinson, who believes Billy has talent, agrees to continue to work with him secretly, and helps him get an audition at the Royal Ballet School in London.You've probably heard that this is an inspiring film, and it is, but be forewarned, this is no pretty, slick Hollywood production. The filmmakers pull no punches in depicting Billy's family's grim poverty, the violence of the strike, or the bitterness of English class divisions. In one scene, Billy's father chops up his late mother's piano for firewood. The burgeoning sexuality of Billy and his friends is explored, with his friend Michael depicted as gay/transgendered. The dialogue contains dozens of f-words that may offend sensitive ""family-friendly"" American ears. (I have not lived in Northern England, but based on my experience living with a working-class family in Ireland, I found the dialogue realistic.) Mrs. Wilkinson smokes in almost every scene she appears in.So why on earth do I say parents should see ""Billy Elliot"" with their (10 and older) kids? Because it shows children that sometimes they have to stand up to their parents to become their authentic selves. Because it shows parents that we have to let our children be themselves and love the children we have. Because, with small gestures and telling details instead of heart-tugging speeches or soaring violins, it shows that life and letting go can be more painful than we think we can stand, but we can survive and have richer, more fulfilling lives for our trouble.",5,"Roughly Beautiful, Parents and Kids 10 and Up Should See Billy Elliot",1368576000,"05 15, 2013",2013,2724,"['title', 'character', 'Billy', 'Elliot', 'boy', 'who', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'dance', 'Rather', 'beautifully-acted', 'tale', 'starkly', 'opposed', 'forces', 'painful', 'hard-won', 'reconciliation.In', '1984', '11-year-old', 'Billy', 'run-down', 'row', 'house', 'industrial', 'suburb', 'Durham', 'England', 'slightly', 'senile', 'grandmother', 'widowed', 'father', 'Jackie', 'elder', 'brother', 'Tony', 'whom', 'are', 'coal', 'miners', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'turned', 'government', 'working', 'people', 'miners', 'are', 'embroiled', 'increasingly', 'violent', 'strike', 'macho', 'culture', 'where', 'hardship', 'months-long', 'strike', 'economic', 'marginalization', 'loss', 'pride', 'have', 'embittered', 'working-class', 'men', 'Billy', 'ballet', 'when', 'white-tutu-clad', 'group', 'girls', 'begins', 'holding', 'dance', 'class', 'same', 'gymnasium', 'disliked', 'boxing', 'lessons.The', 'middle-class', 'ballet', 'teacher', 'Mrs.', 'Wilkinson', 'Billy', 'interest', 'join', 'dance', 'class', 'learn', 'ballet', 'instead', 'boxing', 'Jackie', 'horrified', 'catch', 'Billy', 'doing', 'ballet', 'continue', 'Boys', 'Jackie', 'play', 'football', 'box', 'wrestle', 'Jackie', 'Tony', 'think', 'ballet', 'strictly', 'girls', 'poofs', 'Mrs.', 'Wilkinson', 'who', 'Billy', 'talent', 'continue', 'work', 'secretly', 'get', 'audition', 'Royal', 'Ballet', 'School', 'London.You', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'heard', 'inspiring', 'film', 'be', 'forewarned', 'pretty', 'slick', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'filmmakers', 'pull', 'punches', 'depicting', 'Billy', 'family', 'grim', 'poverty', 'violence', 'strike', 'bitterness', 'English', 'class', 'divisions', 'one', 'scene', 'Billy', 'father', 'up', 'late', 'mother', 'piano', 'firewood', 'burgeoning', 'sexuality', 'Billy', 'friends', 'explored', 'friend', 'Michael', 'depicted', 'gay/transgendered', 'dialogue', 'dozens', 'f-words', 'may', 'offend', 'sensitive', 'family-friendly', 'American', 'ears', 'have', 'not', 'lived', 'Northern', 'England', 'based', 'experience', 'living', 'working-class', 'family', 'Ireland', 'found', 'dialogue', 'realistic', 'Mrs.', 'Wilkinson', 'almost', 'scene', 'in.So', 'why', 'earth', 'do', 'say', 'parents', 'should', 'see', 'Billy', 'Elliot', '10', 'older', 'kids', 'children', 'sometimes', 'have', 'stand', 'up', 'parents', 'become', 'authentic', 'selves', 'parents', 'have', 'let', 'children', 'be', 'love', 'children', 'have', 'small', 'gestures', 'telling', 'details', 'instead', 'heart-tugging', 'speeches', 'soaring', 'violins', 'life', 'letting', 'go', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'painful', 'think', 'can', 'stand', 'can', 'survive', 'have', 'richer', 'more', 'fulfilling', 'lives', 'trouble']",N/A

531564,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXPC,Matthew Horner,"[5, 5]","To me, there are differences between a 'feel good' movie and one that makes you feel good. The phrase 'feel good' implies something shallow, something that touches your emotions in a superficial and often hollow way. You get a little lump in your throat or a smile on your face, but you don't feel anything particularly powerful. But a movie that has the ability to make you feel good is a rare event, and the best ones can connect you with that elusive thing, the human spirit. Billy Elliot is such a movie.Billy Elliot is a twelve year old kid in northern England in 1984 who seems destined for an ordinary life. His dad and his older brother are coal miners, and in the rather dreary town he lives in, it is quietly assumed that Billy will join them one day. Billy is taking a boxing class. One afternoon his instructor asks him to give some keys to Mrs. Wilkerson [Julie Walters], who teaches a ballet class in the same building. She is in no hurry for the keys, so Billy has time to observe the lesson. Something about dancing intrigues Billy, and soon he is secretly attending the classes. Wilkerson is delighted because Billy is easily the most talented pupil she has ever had. It is only a matter of time before Billy is caught by his father and brother, but he is almost mystically drawn to ballet. When he is finally discovered, there is hell to pay. His family is already suffering from the effects of the worst coal miners' strike in British history, and Billy's participation in what they perceive to be an effeminate pursuit just adds to their woes. Billy must now learn how hard it is to follow your heart when it is pulling in two different directions.Jamie Bell is remarkable as Billy. He is the most talented young actor I have seen in years. His command of the role is the more remarkable because this is his first acting assignment. Like his character, he also is from northern England and took dance classes without his friends knowing.The always excellent Julie Walters plays Mrs. Wilkerson as a disillusioned but kind woman who chain smokes while she teaches and who sees in Billy the talent she never had. She also acts as a mother figure to the boy, who recently lost his own Mom. As Billy's dad, Gary Lewis gives us a man who is hard as nails on the outside but thoughtful on the inside. Beyond his blustering, he sees in Billy's dancing an opportunity he never had, but he resists because ballet is so alien to his world.Billy Elliot is one of the most positive, thoughtful and finely crafted movies I have seen recently. It should prove endearing to all the countless people who have found that they are different from the people around them and who have struggled between trying to fit in and following their true destiny.NOTE: The characters in this movie speak in a British dialect which may be unfamiliar to many viewers. It will be well worth the effort of backing up the DVD a bit in order to catch words and phrases you might have trouble understanding.Rated R for language. The MPAA is going to have to conclude that a certain word beginning with 'f' has been heard a thousand times already by teenagers or else movie makers are going to have to sacrifice that word. I mention this because said word is the one and only reason this film was rated R.

That's what Billy's father, Jackie probably thought when he was confronted with the painful (to him) realization that his 11 year old son wanted to do Ballet.  Boys do Boxing, like he and Billy's grandfather did, or wrestle - &quot;they don't do ballet&quot;. Well, Billy takes after his deceased mother who played piano and whom, Billy's grandmother tells him, could have been a professional dancer. Billy enjoys watching Fred Astaire dance in those old movies and when he starts watching the ballet lessons that share the gym with his boxing classes - he's hooked.The film is set in Durham, England during the bitter coal miners strikes of 1984. The social tensions and economic hardships are portrayed with frequent views of riot clad policemen and in the difficulty Jackie and Tony (Billy's foul mouthed older brother) have in just feeding the family. The tensions are of course there when father and brother find out that Billy has been taking the money for boxing and attending ballet classes.The film handles the family relationships well.

531579,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,B00003CXPC,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[7, 7]","Billy Elliot is the story of an 11-year-old boy (Jamie Bell) brought up in a tough working class environment who attends boxing classes at the behest of his tough mining father (Gary Lewis). Unfortunately for Billy however, not only does he has to wear his grandfathers antique boxing gloves but he has no boxing talent whatsoever. Somewhat reluctantly (and secretly from his father) he is drawn into participating in the local ballet classes that take place in the same village hall. There he is taken under the wing of the teacher, Mrs Wilkinson, played by Julie Walters (Educating Rita) who soon realises that his flourishing talent may just be his ticket out of the poverty and deprivation that surround them. However, this is to the horror of his father, for not only is this dancing, it's not even the masculine dance of Gene Kelly. It is ballet, as his father would have it, only for girls and nancy boys.Set in the north east of England during the British miners strike of 1984-5 Director Stephen Daldry perfectly captures the darkest period of British social history and the poverty suffering and devastation that it brought to so many communities in this extremely heartwarming and uplifting movie. The miners strike was the period in Britain's history when Margaret Thatcher (the Iron Lady as she became known) literally starved the coal miners, who were striking to save their jobs and the pits from closing. It literally turned neighbours against one another, brought enormous economic hardship to families and destroyed communities. And when it was all over they closed all the pits anyway and all hope was stolen from the working classes, perhaps never to be restored again.Billy Elliot is a very good movie but I have one objection with it and all the other `gritty' British movies and that is the way the working classes are always portrayed. On the basis of Brassed Off, The Full Monty, Little Voice etc., Americans must really pity us poor British in our squalid terraced council houses and working men's clubs, cigarette permanently in one hand, beer permanently in the other, with our conversations littered with obscenities, even when speaking to kids. The reality is somewhat different and it worries me that a stereotype may begin to develop here. I, and all of my friends come from a working class background and many of the people I knew at school had fathers working in the mines. However, none of them came from a family where obscenities, cigarettes and alcohol were the norm. Certainly there is an element of society that lives like that but from my experience they tend to be the never worked, never want to work lowest of the low, who would never fight to keep a job or bring up a family. (Excuse me whilst I get off my soap box)!Ultimately however, this is a film with a lot of charm, a lot of humour, a lot of heart and great acting performances all round (but particularly from Gary Lewis, Julie Walters and the excellent newcomer Jamie Bell as the title character). The movie is full of fine moments including Billy and his teacher performing a powerhouse dance routine to I Love to Boogie by T Rex, or when Mrs Wilkinson's daughter Debbie idly bangs a stick along the row of policemen's perspex riot shields, whilst sauntering down the street and Billy's dance of rage when his father forbids him from dancing again.Stephen Daldry's direction and the screenplay by Lee Hall are both excellent and it is to their credit that they deal with the question of Billy's nascent sexuality, avoiding vulgarity and judgement. Billy Elliot is not a stereotypical male ballet dancer but the question of his sexuality is left open to question and to their credit the filmmakers have avoided the obvious temptation to reassure the audience that the young boy is straight, because it is irrelevant to the triumph against the odds story. Slightly confusing however, is the use of T rex throughout the soundtrack and other obvious references to the seventies, such as the sight of a Spacehopper and the game Ker-Plunk. 1984/5 was more the time of Wham, Frankie Goes To Hollywood and Duran Duran and the Spacehopper and fallen from fashion some ten years earlier (although now making a return apparently). However, any criticisms are mere details for Billy Elliot is that annual rarity, a really good British movie, that both inspires and entertains in equal volumes.

After all the media's mixed opinions on this movie, it was good to sit down and actually see for ourselves what all the hype(good, bad or otherwise) was about. The only other Brit movie we saw this year was the godawful MAYBE BABY, wrongly marketed as comedy. However, BILLY ELLIOT is billed as drama and is often wittier than you think! The subject matter of a young boy becoming a ballet dancer sounded odd and done-before, but it certainly works here! Set in 1984, with the coal miner's strike as a backdrop, young Billy's interest in ballet dancing causes family friction in a macho-male dominated society of the 1980s Britain. His dance teacher, brilliantly played by Julie Walters, encourgaes him to develop his skills and audition for the Royal Ballet School in London. However, his family are not well off - his father and brother are actively involved in the miner's strike with union activity and things come to a head when Billy's brother is arrested for rioting. Those scenes brought back some memories of that time - the retro settings are just great and the musical soundtrack, featuring T-Rex, The Jam, The Clash and assorted classical pieces is interesting(great songs during end credit roll by Stephen Gately and Eagle Eye Cherry too!) and works well with the film's best moments.

It isn't just the pawning of his deceased wife's jewelry, the last possession of any value left in the house or how beholding he has to become to friend's and neighbors for their support, but it is how he has to put aside the beliefs that those in his class associate with manhood.His younger son, his Billy, is choosing the arts in a time when the Dad knows that there is no future in the mines for anyone. Even so, his son's choice runs so contrary to everything he believes makes a boy a man.There are so many powerful father/son moments that it is hard to even recall them all.I weep four or five times in this film every time. The moment of shock in a gymnasium where Billy was supposed to learn to box when he realizes that his boy not only can dance but desires to do so with his whole heart changes the direction of his life and he knows it.The wonderful moment when Billy cries because he was accepted and his Dad's moment of triumph is dimmed by the news that the union was forced to cave in reminds us that this is not a silly story told outside of time, but in the midst of very hard times.And the Dad and son wrestle in the grass and his Dad holds him close (much as he must have done when he was a baby) and they laugh shows how complex their relationship really is.I could go on.

Both his father and brother are toughened miners who are involved in the contemptuous and sometimes violent strike.  Billy's father sends him to boxing lessons, but he is taken with the ballet students in the next room.  The ballet teacher, Mrs. Wilkinson sees that Billy has real talent and she pushes him to higher limits.  Billy hides the fact that he taken ballet from his family as he feels they will look down on him.  Ballet after all isn't for real men, it is for women and poofs.  after his father finds out that he's been taking ballet lessons instead of boxing, he forbids Billy from ballet.  Defiantly Billy continues private lessons with Ms. Wilkinson and eventually his father sees that Billy truly loves ballet and has a chance to try out for the prestigious Royal Academy of Ballet in London.  But due to the strike, the Elliot's are low on money.  In an act of true love, Mr. Elliot, crosses the picket lines to try to earn money to send Billy to the audition.  He is stopped by his oldest son from actually working, but his actions show that he really loves his family.  In the end, Billy gets into the Academy and triumphs in the face of huge odds.  Billy Elliot could have turned into a deliberate melodrama, but first time director Stephen Daldry doesn't allow that to happen.  The main reason is Jamie Bell who does a tremendous job as Billy.  With a glut young actors out there, Mr. Bell is often overlooked.  This will change as his performance shows great depth as he applies comedic and dramatic touches to Billy.  Julie Waters is excellent as Mrs. Wilkinson as is the rest of the cast.

It is a sure-to-be classic about a young boy, Billy Elliot (newcomer, Jamie Bell), who dreams of becoming a dancer even though his father forbides it because dancing is something that &quot;real men&quot; do not do and it's only for girls.Every single part of this movie is excellent and there is no boring or dull moment. The acting by the entire cast is absolutely flawless with a great storyline and amazing screenplay. The choreography is above all, one of the best parts of the entire film. Jamie Bell and Julie Walters, who plays the kind but strict dance teacher who urges Billy to dance, are the true stand-out actors in this film.BILLY ELLIOT is a heartwarming tale and can be tear-jerky at times, too. One of the best sceens is when Billy shows his father how well he can dance when he dances in that room (I forget where they are), and his father is watching him with tears in his eyes. Another one of my favorite sceens is when Billy is dancing down the street.This is a movie that should be treasured because it is a pure masterpiece.

The relationship between Billy's neighborhood friend was edited making it a very minor friendship which was not in the original.

Despite his father's opposition, he trained til he managed to convince his father he needed a chance at a better life.While this film is very serious in nature, there's a lightness and a hope even in the worst of it.

Plotlines begin and disappear (mostly to accentuate points of character; it's easier and more effective to do so without introducing subplots you don't plan to do anything with), characters are developed and then never realized, ambiguity reigns in areas where definition cries out for exposure, and the soundtrack is a horrid mishmash of songs that may have been appropriate where they were, had the movie's subject matter been about the same things as the songs were (most notably The Clash's &quot;London Calling,&quot; which lent a great deal of weight to what was, at best, a minor scene).As with Cast Away (ONE word, not two...), a director took a fine cast of characters and refused to let them come through.

531603,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CXPC,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 4]","""Billy Elliot,"" one of 2000's best films, is far more than just the typical coming-of-age story.  It is a paean to all of us who have, at one time or another, felt ourselves to be ""different"" from society as a whole (and who among us, in moments of quiet honesty, would deny feeling this way at some time or other in our lives?).  ""Billy Elliot"" takes us back to that time in our lives - early adolescence - when we are just beginning to experience the manifold wonders of the world, when we are just beginning to explore those things which makes us feel good, and when we are just starting that long process of self-discovery that will ultimately define who we are and what we love.  Such a journey can be an easy one if, for instance, that thing that we choose to love happens to be socially acceptable - i.e. football for boys or cooking for girls - but what if it isn't?  What if, say, the focus of attention for a young boy growing up in a poor English mining town happens to be ballet dancing?  Then growing up and staying true to oneself suddenly become all that more challenging.  If for no other reason, ""Billy Elliot"" deserves credit for tackling and illuminating the tricky and sometimes uncomfortable subject of adolescent gender-bending.Billy is an 11-year old boy whose life provides little opportunity for warmth or joy.  His father and brother are striking miners, his beloved mother has recently passed away and his maternal grandmother struggles with the disorientation that comes with advancing senility.  The one ray of light in Billy's otherwise drab, humorless life is his fascination with the ballet class that meets in the same gym where he is supposed to be receiving his boxing lessons.  One of the great joys of ""Billy Elliot"" comes in these early scenes as we see Billy going to enormous lengths to hide the truth of his activities, secreting his dancing shoes under his mattress or inside his trousers or absconding with a book on dancing from a local book mobile etc.  Who among us can fail to identify with this sense that, if others discovered what we REALLY loved, we would quickly become a pariah, a misfit, an outcast?  Haven't we all, at some time or other, secretly hidden objects that meant the world to us but that others just wouldn't understand if they saw we had them?  Well, ""Billy Elliot"" reminds us that it is okay to be different, that indeed pursuing our goal - whatever it is - is the single most important step to achieving personal happiness.In terms of plotting, there is not really much that is new here.  The conflict-ridden lower class family, the recently dead mother, the feisty, sympathetic teacher who places all her faith in her young pupil, the initial reluctance on the part of the family and the community to accept Billy's dream and their ultimately yielding to his wishes - these are all elements we have seen in films before.  Yet, somehow, ""Billy Elliot"" never seems clich&eacute;d or derivative, partly because writer Lee Hall and director Stephen Daldry get the details of character and setting so right and partly because Jamie Bell delivers such a luminous, naturalistic performance as Billy.  Thanks to Bell's subtle underplaying, Billy never comes across as precious or precocious.  He is just an ordinary kid with an extraordinary gift who is not afraid to ultimately stand up and defend his own originality.  As the ballet instructor, Julie Walters conveys just the right combination of firm determination and openhearted compassion to make her a believable inspiration to her young charge.  Gary Lewis, Jamie Draven and Jean Heywood are all excellent as Billy's father, brother and grandmother respectively.The term ""feel good movie"" is often the kiss of death when it comes to encouraging the less sentimentally inclined among us to check out a film.  But ""Billy Elliot"" really is a movie that could serve a salutary purpose.  If it inspires even one parent to allow a child to fulfill his or her dream - regardless of what it happens to be - it may be one of those rare films that actually does some good in the world.  Not bad for a little independent charmer like this one.",4,wonderful feel-good triumph,995068800,"07 14, 2001",2001,4152,"['Billy', 'Elliot', 'one', '2000', 'best', 'films', 'far', 'more', 'just', 'typical', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'paean', 'who', 'have', 'one', 'time', 'felt', 'be', 'different', 'society', 'whole', 'who', 'moments', 'quiet', 'honesty', 'would', 'deny', 'feeling', 'way', 'time', 'other', 'lives', 'Billy', 'Elliot', 'back', 'time', 'lives', 'early', 'adolescence', 'when', 'are', 'just', 'beginning', 'experience', 'manifold', 'wonders', 'world', 'when', 'are', 'just', 'beginning', 'explore', 'things', 'feel', 'good', 'when', 'are', 'just', 'starting', 'long', 'process', 'self-discovery', 'will', 'ultimately', 'define', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'love', 'journey', 'can', 'be', 'easy', 'one', 'instance', 'thing', 'choose', 'love', 'happens', 'be', 'socially', 'acceptable', 'i.e', 'football', 'boys', 'cooking', 'girls', 'what', ""n't"", 'What', 'say', 'focus', 'attention', 'young', 'boy', 'growing', 'up', 'poor', 'English', 'mining', 'town', 'be', 'ballet', 'dancing', 'Then', 'growing', 'up', 'staying', 'true', 'oneself', 'suddenly', 'become', 'more', 'challenging', 'other', 'reason', 'Billy', 'Elliot', 'credit', 'tackling', 'illuminating', 'tricky', 'sometimes', 'uncomfortable', 'subject', 'adolescent', 'gender-bending.Billy', '11-year', 'old', 'boy', 'life', 'little', 'opportunity', 'warmth', 'joy', 'father', 'brother', 'are', 'striking', 'miners', 'beloved', 'mother', 'recently', 'passed', 'away', 'maternal', 'grandmother', 'disorientation', 'advancing', 'senility', 'one', 'ray', 'light', 'Billy', 'otherwise', 'drab', 'humorless', 'life', 'fascination', 'ballet', 'class', 'same', 'gym', 'where', 'supposed', 'be', 'receiving', 'boxing', 'lessons', 'One', 'great', 'joys', 'Billy', 'Elliot', 'early', 'scenes', 'see', 'Billy', 'going', 'enormous', 'lengths', 'hide', 'truth', 'activities', 'secreting', 'dancing', 'shoes', 'mattress', 'inside', 'trousers', 'absconding', 'book', 'dancing', 'local', 'book', 'mobile', 'etc', 'Who', 'can', 'fail', 'identify', 'sense', 'others', 'discovered', 'what', 'REALLY', 'loved', 'would', 'quickly', 'become', 'pariah', 'misfit', 'outcast', 'Have', ""n't"", 'time', 'other', 'secretly', 'hidden', 'objects', 'meant', 'world', 'others', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'understand', 'saw', 'had', 'Well', 'Billy', 'Elliot', 'okay', 'be', 'different', 'indeed', 'pursuing', 'goal', 'whatever', 'single', 'most', 'important', 'step', 'achieving', 'personal', 'happiness.In', 'terms', 'plotting', 'not', 'really', 'much', 'new', 'here', 'conflict-ridden', 'lower', 'class', 'family', 'recently', 'dead', 'mother', 'feisty', 'sympathetic', 'teacher', 'who', 'faith', 'young', 'pupil', 'initial', 'reluctance', 'part', 'family', 'community', 'accept', 'Billy', 'dream', 'ultimately', 'yielding', 'wishes', 'are', 'elements', 'have', 'seen', 'films', 'somehow', 'Billy', 'Elliot', 'never', 'clich', 'eacute', 'derivative', 'partly', 'writer', 'Lee', 'Hall', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Daldry', 'get', 'details', 'character', 'setting', 'so', 'right', 'partly', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'delivers', 'such', 'luminous', 'naturalistic', 'performance', 'Billy', 'Thanks', 'Bell', 'subtle', 'underplaying', 'Billy', 'never', 'across', 'precious', 'precocious', 'just', 'ordinary', 'kid', 'extraordinary', 'gift', 'who', 'not', 'afraid', 'ultimately', 'stand', 'up', 'defend', 'own', 'originality', 'ballet', 'instructor', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'conveys', 'just', 'right', 'combination', 'firm', 'determination', 'openhearted', 'compassion', 'make', 'believable', 'inspiration', 'young', 'charge', 'Gary', 'Lewis', 'Jamie', 'Draven', 'Jean', 'Heywood', 'are', 'excellent', 'Billy', 'father', 'brother', 'grandmother', 'respectively.The', 'term', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'often', 'kiss', 'death', 'when', 'encouraging', 'less', 'sentimentally', 'inclined', 'check', 'out', 'film', 'Billy', 'Elliot', 'really', 'movie', 'could', 'serve', 'salutary', 'purpose', 'even', 'one', 'parent', 'allow', 'child', 'fulfill', 'dream', 'regardless', 'what', 'be', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'actually', 'good', 'world', 'Not', 'bad', 'little', 'independent', 'charmer', 'one']",N/A

There are few local pleasures to be had, police in riot gear are on their ever-present guard throughout the streets, and the whole thing in general is a confluence of rusted metal doors and brick tenements that look like they are built haphazardly on top of each other. Billy, like the rest of the young men in the village, goes to daily boxing practice in order to keep up repressive prototypes of machismo that all the men in the town must ascribe to. Unfortunately he is not very good at it, but is does have natural and immediately evident talent in the ballet classes which get taught in the same gym as soon as boxing practice ends. Soon Billy finds his true calling in the art, all the while keeping it a secret from his drunk and depressive father and brother, themselves caught in their own strife with the ongoing Miners Strike that plagued their part of the country at that time.Billy Elliot is a film about staying true to yourself and ignoring adversity. It is about finding what's right for you and following it with everything you've got. It is about using your God-given talent to improve yourelf and get yourself out of your current sad reality. It is about not judging others, about kindness. As a film it works beautifully. The screenplay is witty, the characters are true, the storyline fantastical but not at all improbable. Films like this are so simple and sweet and rare that to criticize them is to take away from the intentions of the piece.

I've raised two boys of my own, and let me tell you, Jamie Bell's portrayal of adolescent angst, boy-style is flawless.  I've actually witnessed my thirteen year-old son pound something and then punch the air in impotent rage as Billy did after his father forbade him to take any more dance lessons, and when Billy's teacher chastised him for not practicing and Billy angrily responded that he couldn't do what she was asking, my son, recognizing the problem immediately, sagely stated,""He can't do it because he's angry.""  When Billy told off his teacher for always telling him what to do ""the same as everybody else,"" I asked my daughter if it reminded her of anybody, and she laughed and said,""Yeah, Brian! (the aforementioned 13 year old).  When Billy danced out his anger and frustration at not being heard and at having no control over anything that was happening to him or to his family, and then came smack up against a wall, pounding it and giving it one last elbow-jab before sinking into sullen silence, Brian, again recognizing himself, said, ""I make that face.""  It's hard to believe that Jamie Bell had almost no acting experience before he made this movie.  I believe he is going to be a force to reckon with in the movie world.Aside from Jamie Bell's spectacular acting and dancing, the other characters were perfectly cast and acted. Julie Walters (Educating Rita) as the chain-smoking dance teacher who both mothers and pushes Billy to the limit is at her absolute best, as is Gary Lewis as the grieving, angry, bewildered father.The story itself was at once heartbreaking and heartwarming without being either contrived or shmaltzy.  One does not have to be a boy who has recently lost his mother, and who'd rather dance than box, to relate to Billy's struggle to deal with adversity and to be accepted for who he is.

Billy, however, lives with his elder brother and his father, both of whom are striking miners and neither of whom can abide let alone comprehend Billy's desire to take ballet lessons.  It simply isn't done.  It's not for a lad, and that's that.Billy struggles to follow both his heart and his innate talent in order to break free from a less-than-ideal (and at times even violent) home life and the prospects of a bleak future.  As a result, walls, cages, barriers and other images of entrapment figure prominently in the film, underscoring his predicament, and his dancing (by which means he struggles to break free) is powerfully juxtaposed with scenes of the violence, rage, and hatred in the community at the time.The Special Edition of the video contains a 20 minute blurb (after the closing credits) with the show's stars, producers, and director talking about the film, the characters, and the situation in England at the time, all of which is interspersed with brief clips from the film.The film is a 2000 BBC co-production with a running time of 111 minutes.  Apart from a superb storyline that is powerfully portrayed, the acting is absolutely first rate by all involved.  The Northumberland accents may be a little difficult at first for some, but it's nothing that can't be overcome with close attention, and it's well worth the effort.In short, I'd highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a moving and inspiring yet rough-around-the-edges story of a lad intent upon breaking free and following his dreams in spite of the odds.  This is not some slick but gooey, maudlin Hollywood-style production, and in my opinion it's all the better for it.

Our hero's father finds out from his boxing teacher that his son has been hovering on the dark side and there is a confrontation. In the end the dads love wins out against his prejudices of what a man should do. The climax is set in a strange ... version of Swan Lake in which the various swan parts are played by male dancers. Our hero has been able to escape the dead end of working class life and move into the tertiary sector. The film is sort of okay but I found it hard to get into. I preferred the similar but less artificial Bootmen. Still that just may be nationalism. Despite my prejudices the film is well crafted original and was much loved.,3,Okay I guess,998784000,"08 26, 2001",2001,1432,"['film', 'was', 'enormously', 'popular', 'England', 'young', 'boy', 'rising', 'up', 'elements', 'set', 'background', 'miners', 'strike', 'type', 'film', 'intrepid', 'hero', 'young', 'working', 'class', 'lad', 'who', 'dad', 'sets', 'aside', 'small', 'amounts', 'dole', 'money', 'can', 'learn', 'box', 'look', 'Instead', 'boxing', 'out', 'lad', 'drawn', 'other', 'side', 'hall', 'where', 'girls', 'are', 'practicing', 'ballet', 'take', 'lessons', 'dad', 'will', 'not', 'approve', 'so', 'one', 'young', 'lad', 'bit', 'talent', 'teacher', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'Educating', 'Rita', 'Julie', 'trapped', 'loveless', 'pointless', 'marriage', 'someone', 'who', 'overweight', 'attracted', 'young', 'hero', 'one', 'aspect', 'beauty', 'otherwise', 'messy', 'life', 'hero', 'father', 'out', 'boxing', 'teacher', 'son', 'been', 'hovering', 'dark', 'side', 'confrontation', 'end', 'dads', 'love', 'out', 'prejudices', 'what', 'man', 'should', 'do', 'climax', 'set', 'strange', 'version', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'various', 'swan', 'parts', 'are', 'played', 'male', 'dancers', 'hero', 'been', 'able', 'escape', 'dead', 'end', 'working', 'class', 'life', 'move', 'tertiary', 'sector', 'film', 'sort', 'okay', 'found', 'hard', 'get', 'preferred', 'similar', 'less', 'artificial', 'Bootmen', 'Still', 'just', 'may', 'be', 'nationalism', 'prejudices', 'film', 'well', 'crafted', 'original', 'was', 'much', 'loved']",N/A

I saw so much of myself as an artist and identified completely with Billy.  I think we all have personal struggles, especially in youth, and Billy gives us hope that we can win.  This picture is one of my favourites and I must have it for my collection.  The sound track is fabulous and probably worth owning on it's own for T-Rex and Stephen Gately.The symbolism is simply brilliant.  I hope everyone notices the swans on the wallpaper during the feather pillow fight scene.  This ties in with the whole theme of wings, feathers, flying to freedom, and ""Swan Lake"", with a genius interpretation of the ugly-duckling-to-swan metamorphosis that Billy makes, only he is quite cute.  The story is all about overcoming the unrecognised oppression that males face straight or gay.  There is also a sense of anger/fear changing to cathartic tenderness between men and it's about time we have more of this in pictures.  Men's liberation has only begun.I would recommend this picture for everyone young or old, fed up to the back teeth with the constrictions of antiquated thinking, and seeking great entertainment.
