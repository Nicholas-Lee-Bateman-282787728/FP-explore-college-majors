Don't get me wrong, it's very well done and the acting is good...  but here are some things that I cannot over look.The 2 Biggest Flaws that I can't ignore are:Flaw #1.) Dr. MacNeill's wife ... in the actual &#34;Christy&#34; novel his wife has died in child birth several years before Christy ever arrives in the cove. *** However, in this TV Series, Dr. MacNeill's wife is alive and shockingly becomes a dance hall girl! o.O ***Flaw #2.) CBS did not bother to finish the story while they had the chance with the original cast... leaving everyone with a major 5 year long cliff hanger of Christy's decision between David (the pastor) and Dr. MacNeill.However, thankfully, PAX TV (aka ION TV) in 2000 took it over and finished the story.  The producers drew Christy's ultimate romantic decision from notes for an unfinished sequel Christy novel that were discovered among Catherine Marshall's possessions after her death.Any way...  on the whole, it's a good series.  But I would advise the parents to view each episode before letting younger children watch it...  especially the very last episode with the dance hall girls!",5,"Great Series, but it does have serious flaws",1387756800,"12 23, 2013",2013,1325,"['do', 'enjoy', 'series', 'however', 'are', 'things', 'writers', 'changed', 'are', 'very', 'irritating', 'also', 'infuriating', 'are', 'inaccurate', 'unfaithful', '34', 'Christy', '34', 'novel', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'acting', 'good', 'here', 'are', 'things', 'can', 'not', 'over', 'look.The', '2', 'Biggest', 'Flaws', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ignore', 'are', 'Flaw', '1', 'Dr.', 'MacNeill', 'wife', 'actual', '34', 'Christy', '34', 'wife', 'died', 'child', 'birth', 'several', 'years', 'Christy', 'ever', 'cove', '***', 'However', 'TV', 'Series', 'Dr.', 'MacNeill', 'wife', 'alive', 'shockingly', 'dance', 'hall', 'girl', 'o.O', '***Flaw', '2', 'CBS', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'finish', 'story', 'had', 'chance', 'original', 'cast', 'leaving', 'everyone', 'major', '5', 'year', 'long', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'Christy', 'decision', 'David', 'pastor', 'Dr.', 'MacNeill.However', 'thankfully', 'PAX', 'TV', 'aka', 'ION', 'TV', '2000', 'took', 'over', 'finished', 'story', 'producers', 'drew', 'Christy', 'ultimate', 'romantic', 'decision', 'notes', 'unfinished', 'sequel', 'Christy', 'novel', 'were', 'discovered', 'Catherine', 'Marshall', 'possessions', 'death.Any', 'way', 'whole', 'good', 'series', 'would', 'advise', 'parents', 'view', 'episode', 'letting', 'younger', 'children', 'watch', 'especially', 'very', 'last', 'episode', 'dance', 'hall', 'girls']",N/A

1038624,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B000LC4ZBC,Bobby Underwood,"[161, 161]","This gentle and heartfelt drama was wholesome and substantive television for families. Based on the cherished book by Catherine Marshall detailing her mother's time in the Tennessee Smoky Mountains in 1912, it is the story of a young and exuberant city girl who comes to teach in poverty-striken Cutter Gap and the manner in which it changed her life forever.The book was warm and wonderful and those like myself who loved it had doubts that the essence of it could truly be captured for television. It was a pleasant surprise when those doubts were proven to have no validity. It was faithful in conveying both the feelings and the atmosphere of the book and, for many, including myself, Kellie Martin will always be Christy Huddelston. Her wide-eyed and hopeful performance was perfect, and Tyne Daly added emotional depth as Miss Alice, the Quaker woman who had seen heartache before yet found the strength to carry on.The wonderful Tess Harper portrayed the sensible and delicate Fairlight Spencer, who offered Christy the most cherished gift of those great mountains; her friendship. There was a wholesome and romantic glow to this series as the hardships these people experienced in their lives every day and the sometimes illegal means they used to survive came into conflict with the teachings of the young Minister, David (Randall Batinkoff), who is smitten with Christy.But the older doctor who understood the people of Cutter Gap better may be the one Christy would find love with if she could hold on to the joy that brought her there. Stewart Finlay-McLennan had a nice turn as Doc Neil, who had some feelings of his own for young Christy. But it was the children and their teacher who took center stage as Christy faced opposition which kept some of the children away. None of them had shoes and sometimes very little to eat, but nearly all of them had a thirst for knowledge.Her greatest challenge was a little girl who did not speak and an older boy whose father was the worst of the moonshiners. He acted like a bully because it was what he had been taught. But when Christy caught him reading David Copperfield and talking angrily about making something of himself from nothing in the pilot film, she knew there was hope. The attempted destruction of the schoolhouse brought everything to a boiling point at the beginning, and Christy had to decide once and for all whether to stay or leave forever.The greens and blues of the beautiful Smoky Mountains were romantically photographed by Mike Fash in director Michael Rhodes' warmhearted remembrance of this young and pretty teacher who came to Cutter Gap and made a difference. Kellie Martin's voice-over added warmth and understanding to Christy's emotional journey into a place she would come to call home.Patricia Green co-produced and wrote the teleplay for the original film, and the affection she and everyone involved with the project had for Catherine Marshall's book cames across in every frame, in every episode.This series could break your heart one moment and uplift your spirits the next. It  maintained a high standard of quality. Christy was a warm and sometimes poignant examination of a yong woman's personal journey of faith. It was, as the saying goes, ""too good"" for television, but remained on the air long enough to leave its mark.It also was a great role for Kellie Martin, of ""Life Goes On"" fame. While she has found another good role as of late in a series of films as Samantha Kinsey, mystery lover and owner of a mystery book store, ""Christy"" will probably always be the role she will be most identified with. Fans have been waiting a long time for this one and it's a pleasant surprise to see it is finally being released.

I'm disappointed that I didn't catch it then and that it only lasted one season.  It's a sweet, old-fashioned, clean, faith-focused, family show.  The lead actors are great in their roles.  The two male leads, in Dr. MacNeill and Reverend David Grantland, play wonderfully off each other.  Their combative and competitive relationship (over the heart of the schoolteacher, Christy) is very often the source of laugh-out-loud moments.  It's too bad they weren't able to wrap up the storyline with the same actors.  I know who Christy is supposed to end up with but with the way the season ends (her looking back and forth between the two, holding a ring), it doesn't make sense that she picks who she picks.I haven't seen the PAX movie series yet but I have a feeling it won't be as enjoyable since only Dr. MacNeill returns.  There are a few annoying quirks about the show that keep it from being a 5-star show, at least to me.  One, Alice Henderson (played well by Tyne Daly) talks too much in ""thee"" and ""thy"" but yet not all the time so it just seems odd and makes the conversation into platitudes.  Christy (played by Kellie Martin) is sweet and innocent, sometimes aggravatingly so.  She also morphs into speaking in the accent of Cutter Gap every so often.  Again it's an odd way of talking- but then they all talk pretty funny.  Another annoyance is how the sentiment comes off as melodramatic and hokey at times, making serious moments laughable.""That waren't right, teacher...""  The schoolchildren are very good actors in their own right.  They are able to deliver such lines in the funny accents, and easily keep a straight face.  They, at least the little boys, must have been having a jolly good time, getting to run around all dirty all the time.Overall, a great family show.

1038630,A1OVYZPXPB0RKB,B000LC4ZBC,"C.J. Darlington ""Author of Thicker Than Blood...","[15, 15]","It was an interesting choice to transform the novel Christy into a tv series. With the expectation of millions running high, Christy made its debut in April 1994. Unlike a movie, the characters would have to take on lives of their own apart from the book (think Little House on the Prairie), which could potentially alienate its most receptive viewers---the readers of the novel.If the producers had concerns about the public's reception, they need not have worried. The show was an instant success with the public, but unfortunately suffered in the ratings (due to poor time scheduling according to some sources) and only lasted two seasons. What success the show did have can greatly be attributed to its star, Kellie Martin, known for her work in Life Goes On, ER and now the Hallmark Channel's popular Mystery Woman. Martin, eighteen at the time, skillfully pulled off Christy's innocence and spunk to such a degree that she BECAME Christy in many viewers' minds.""Only my father saw me to the Asheville station that Sunday morning in 1912.""When Catherine Marshall penned the first line of Christy some forty years ago, she couldn't possibly have known that an estimated 30 million people would read it. Christy was in Marshall's words ""a story I have always wanted to write."" Based on the real-life experiences of her mother and nine years in the writing, the novel was originally published by McGraw Hill in 1967. With more than 10 million copies in print, Christy is considered a landmark title in Christian publishing, but especially in Christian fiction. In a time when this genre was almost nonexistent except for the occasional Biblical epic, Christy tells the story of nineteen-year-old Christy Huddleston who travels to backwoods Cutter Gap, Tennessee to teach children in a mission school. Naive and inexperienced, her trials and triumphs fill nearly 500 engaging pages. Regrettably, Marshall (who died in 1983) never lived to see her novel come to life on the small screen.Supporting cast members include notables such as Tyne Daly (Judging Amy, Cagney & Lacey) who played Alice Henderson, a devote Quaker and Christy's mentor. Daly won an Emmy in 1996 for the role. We quickly grow to love her portrayal of Alice, but this is where the show strayed from Marshall's original depiction of a kinder, gentler lady. The novel described her thus in postman Ben Pentland's words, ""She's a smiley woman. All her wrinkles are smile-wrinkles. Has a heap o' hair, light hair, leetle grey in it now. Wears her hair in braids that she folds round and round her head, like---like a crown."" Stewart Finlay-McLennan (The Last Sin Eater, National Treasure) as Dr. Neil McNeil was always a fan favorite, as was Emily Schulman's Ruby Mae Morrison, who offered some lightness and humor to the show.Later episodes brought characters to life who had died in the novel before Christy ever arrived in Cutter Gap (Alice's daughter Margaret) or who died during the story (Tom McHone). Some even showed up who never existed in the book. Levar Burton's Daniel Scott seemed the most out of place of these. Like Michael Landon occasionally did with Little House on the Prairie, it seemed the writers were trying too hard with Burton's character to infuse modern themes into a historical setting. Then again, you can't beat the success of Little House, so maybe they were on the right track after all. Watch Christy as a tv show rather than a book adaptation and you'll be just fine.Perhaps the greatest achievement of Christy is the way it upholds morals and spirituality. Not only are the heroine's physical adventures chronicled, but moral lessons are woven through the storylines as well. Those seeking excellent family entertainment will find 907 enjoyable minutes of it on this 4-disc set. It's a wonder why all 19 episodes are only now making it to DVD.--Reviewed by C.J.

However, this wasn't the case with the ""Christy"" series! First and foremost, Kellie Martin and Tyne Daly were perfectly cast in the roles of 19-year-old schoolteacher Christy Huddleston and Quaker missionary Alice Henderson. Secondly, the show generally kept true with the storylines and descriptions first brought to life in Marshall's classic novel, making it easy for fans to make the transition to the show.If you aren't familiar with the story, the general premise involves the title character, a recent transplant from a wealthy North Carolina family, who has just arrived in the poor but proud community of Cutter Gap, Tennessee, in 1912 to teach school. It's Christy's first time on her own, and her eyes are certainly opened as she experiences the effects of ignorance, poverty and disease. As she struggles to convert the residents to her beliefs, they also teach Christy a little about faith, nature, love and other life essentials.Often seen with Christy are David Grantland, a young minister who is desperate to win her heart; and Neil MacNeil, a native doctor who equally intrigues and infuriates the stubborn, idealistic schoolteacher.My only complaint is that the series was so short-lived!

1038646,ARLKYF9JL3QKB,B000LC4ZBC,J. SHARP,"[12, 13]","Upon viewing this series again for the first time in more than a decade, I was reminded anew of how much I deeply loved and respected it and how bitterly disappointed I was that it was cancelled after one season. I had forgotten just how much I missed it.On its surface, 'Christy' looked like a simple attempt by CBS to recreate the alchemy of its hugely successful hit 'Dr. Quinn: Medicine Woman,' with frontier family drama, a benevolent-fish-out-of-water heroine, and a dash of romance. But it ended up being a great deal more than that. It took those elements and added two other critical ingredients. One is well-worn in television storytelling, the other treated like the third rail of commercial TV.The series was extremely conscientious about treating the denizens of the fictional mountain community of Cutter Gap with respect and dignity even as it showed the negative side of their almost feral life. Christy Huddleston was constantly learning not to condescend to them, even though many of their ways were not only backward but patently self-destructive, even deadly. She consistently learned as much from them as they did from her.Most surprisingly, the series addressed religion in an adult manner, making it an organic part of the story rather than a theme to visit every so often. Christy teaches school to the mountain children as part of her service as a Christian missionary. She and the other missionaries speak of God as a matter of course and discuss their faith in honest, practical terms. They have faults and address them inconsistently but determinedly. The agnostic local doctor frequently confronts them with questions (some honest, some not) about their beliefs and motives and they respond honestly, sometimes learning more about themselves and their faith in the process, and frequently give the doctor something to chew on as well. And unlike most television Christians, they discover the error of preachiness without recanting the truth they were preaching. This balanced, faith-with-boots-on approach was bracingly refreshing and downright exciting in 1994. Recent attempts to 'humanize' Christian characters by essentially making them universalists (Aaron Sorkin, take note) get it all wrong. 'Christy' got it as close to right as I've seen yet.Enough praise cannot be heaped on the then-19-year-old Kellie Martin, who carried the series with the aplomb of someone twice her age. She makes Christy not only adorable but admirable. And Tyne Daly, who won another Emmy for this role, is a constant treat.My only qualms with this release echo everyone else's. Double-sided discs are a huge no-no. Handling them with care is always problematic.

1038656,A11HB3LYLIQNZP,B000LC4ZBC,"PhiloX ""PhiloX""","[5, 5]","I don't watch much TV but if I do it's either the news or PBS on HDTV antenna, neither with satellite nor with cable. In so doing I missed the mini series ""Christy"" when it aired in the mid 1990's. I bought this DVD on a whim to keep my wife & I warm during the winter nights, something like ""Little House on the Prairie"" or ""Anne of Green Gables"" that holds a certain innocence & charm. Yes, some of the characters are rather simplified as for example Bird's Eye as the typical villain, & some of the plots are copies from other TV series, for example almost every TV series has a ghost story. Yet the main characters have taken a hold on me & I have learned some moral lessons that reflect my current thoughts.Christy (Kellie Martin) is an idealist upper middle class young woman that leaves her small city life of safety to become a school teacher in the backwards Smokey Mountain area of Tennessee. She thinks that she can help the people into the early 20th century, yet they teach her more than what she has to offer. She falls in love with 2 antithetical men; Rev. David Grantland (Randall Batinkoff) a simple but honest preacher verses Dr. Neil MacNeill (Stewart Finlay-McLennon) an irreligious man from the area who has taught himself to become a doctor. The story unfolds with no surprises until the last DVD where everything is revealed & Christy's life nearly falls apart for 2 main reasons:1. The main benefactor of the mission, who is from the Christy home city, turns out all along to be plotting to buy off the local people's land for lumber.2. Christy must choose who she truly loves.What really makes this series work is that Christy thinks she is doing good yet evil has a way of twisting the outcome. In other words: Have you ever done something that you thought was for good yet it backfired & what you worked so hard for turns out bad in the end? What I am getting at is that the series may seem to be rather simple in plot yet holds a profound message in the end: The best of attentions may not turn out for the greater good. A great DVD series for the whole family.Extra Bonus:July Collins guest stars in a few episodes as a blind woman who sings the local folk songs. Strangely in one spisode she sings the Shaker's song ""Simple Gift's"" which is out of place for that area.Note about Comment Section from Bobby Underwood's Review:One person wrote a comment on Bobby Underwood's great review questioning if the ""Christy"" DVD series was good for children & if there were any bad words. I don't remember any bad words, at least they are not upfront enough to notice. Therefore ""Christy"" is clean enough that you would have to focus on finding any bad words. These days I rarely go to movie theaters because of the over use of bad words as well as a few other issues. A few years ago I watched ""Rainman"" with Tom Cruise, it must have been at a friend's house or something, & it had the most extreme & unnessary use of bad words that I would never watch that film again. Therefore when a film or series over uses bad words it is obvious & desensitizes you. ""Christy"" did not do this.Another issue about Family Viewing:In the last DVD, the hill men go down to the nearest town to visit a ""Tea House"" which is really a Cabrera. There are some flirtatious women in petticoats & robes which was questionable in the early 20th century, but I have seen some modern cartoons which reveal more. Maybe a ""PG"" rating?I would have given this DVD a ""5"" for its underlining moral lessons, or its grand twist in the last episodes, but I agree with some of the other reviews; the manufactures made 4 non descript double sided DVD's with no inner notes, nor special features wrapped in a strange cheap plastic. In fact I thought the plastic was the removeable cover that normally comes with DVD's. Therefore a ""4"" is given.",4,Family Show with Profound Ending,1196380800,"11 30, 2007",2007,3827,"['do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'much', 'TV', 'do', 'news', 'PBS', 'HDTV', 'antenna', 'satellite', 'cable', 'doing', 'missed', 'mini', 'series', 'Christy', 'when', 'aired', 'mid', '1990', 'bought', 'DVD', 'whim', 'keep', 'wife', 'warm', 'winter', 'nights', 'something', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'certain', 'innocence', 'charm', 'Yes', 'characters', 'are', 'rather', 'simplified', 'example', 'Bird', 'Eye', 'typical', 'villain', 'plots', 'are', 'copies', 'other', 'TV', 'series', 'example', 'almost', 'TV', 'series', 'ghost', 'story', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'taken', 'hold', 'have', 'learned', 'moral', 'lessons', 'reflect', 'current', 'thoughts.Christy', 'Kellie', 'Martin', 'idealist', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'young', 'woman', 'small', 'city', 'life', 'safety', 'become', 'school', 'teacher', 'backwards', 'Smokey', 'Mountain', 'area', 'Tennessee', 'can', 'help', 'people', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'yet', 'teach', 'more', 'what', 'offer', 'love', '2', 'antithetical', 'men', 'Rev', 'David', 'Grantland', 'Randall', 'Batinkoff', 'simple', 'honest', 'preacher', 'verses', 'Dr.', 'Neil', 'MacNeill', 'Stewart', 'Finlay-McLennon', 'irreligious', 'man', 'area', 'who', 'taught', 'become', 'doctor', 'story', 'unfolds', 'surprises', 'last', 'DVD', 'where', 'everything', 'revealed', 'Christy', 'life', 'nearly', 'apart', '2', 'main', 'reasons:1', 'main', 'benefactor', 'mission', 'who', 'Christy', 'home', 'city', 'out', 'all', 'along', 'be', 'plotting', 'buy', 'off', 'local', 'people', 'land', 'lumber.2', 'Christy', 'must', 'choose', 'who', 'truly', 'loves.What', 'really', 'series', 'work', 'Christy', 'doing', 'good', 'yet', 'evil', 'way', 'twisting', 'outcome', 'other', 'words', 'Have', 'ever', 'done', 'something', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'backfired', 'what', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'out', 'bad', 'end', 'What', 'am', 'getting', 'series', 'may', 'seem', 'be', 'rather', 'simple', 'plot', 'yet', 'profound', 'message', 'end', 'best', 'attentions', 'may', 'not', 'turn', 'out', 'greater', 'good', 'great', 'DVD', 'series', 'whole', 'family.Extra', 'Bonus', 'July', 'Collins', 'guest', 'stars', 'few', 'episodes', 'blind', 'woman', 'who', 'local', 'folk', 'songs', 'Strangely', 'one', 'spisode', 'Shaker', 'song', 'Simple', 'Gift', 'place', 'area.Note', 'Comment', 'Section', 'Bobby', 'Underwood', 'Review', 'One', 'person', 'wrote', 'comment', 'Bobby', 'Underwood', 'great', 'review', 'questioning', 'Christy', 'DVD', 'series', 'was', 'good', 'children', 'were', 'bad', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'bad', 'words', 'least', 'are', 'not', 'upfront', 'enough', 'notice', 'Christy', 'clean', 'enough', 'would', 'have', 'focus', 'finding', 'bad', 'words', 'days', 'rarely', 'go', 'movie', 'theaters', 'over', 'use', 'bad', 'words', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'other', 'issues', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'watched', 'Rainman', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'friend', 'house', 'something', 'had', 'most', 'extreme', 'unnessary', 'use', 'bad', 'words', 'would', 'never', 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'Therefore', 'when', 'film', 'series', 'uses', 'bad', 'words', 'obvious', 'Christy', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'this.Another', 'issue', 'Family', 'Viewing', 'last', 'DVD', 'hill', 'men', 'go', 'down', 'nearest', 'town', 'visit', 'Tea', 'House', 'really', 'Cabrera', 'are', 'flirtatious', 'women', 'petticoats', 'robes', 'was', 'questionable', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'have', 'seen', 'modern', 'cartoons', 'reveal', 'more', 'Maybe', 'PG', 'rating', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'DVD', '5', 'underlining', 'moral', 'lessons', 'grand', 'twist', 'last', 'episodes', 'agree', 'other', 'reviews', 'manufactures', 'made', '4', 'non', 'descript', 'double', 'sided', 'DVD', 'inner', 'notes', 'special', 'features', 'wrapped', 'strange', 'cheap', 'plastic', 'fact', 'thought', 'plastic', 'was', 'removeable', 'cover', 'normally', 'DVD', 'Therefore', '4', 'given']",N/A

1038661,AJGP5XYKKBGBG,B000LC4ZBC,Reliable Reviews,"[5, 6]","Set in the smokey mountains of Tennessee in 1912. A young lady comes from the city to start a school for children of the poor, rugged, mountain community. She faces hardships, but is helped by a woman who provides her lodging, Ms. Alice. She is also helped by a young Irish doctor, Dr. Neil MacNeil, and a young preacher, David. Drama and relationships. Scenic. I enjoyed this series of 15 hours.The three sequels:I did not like the three Christy sequels, with the different actress as Christy, Lauren Lee Smith: ""Christy a New Beginning"", ""Return to Cutter Gap"", and ""A Change of Seasons"". Though these three sequels are the same setting, with the same doctor; the stories are just not interesting. Substituting a successful actor never works. They would have done better to have Christy leave, and a new girl by another name, say Gwendolyn, come teach in her place, rather than substituting Christys and relying upon the audience to use their imagination. They relied upon the audience to imagine better scripts as well.I enjoyed this series first time, but was not interested to watch it again years later, because this series is more interesting for girls and women, because it revolves totally around Christy.

I love it so much that I've decided I'm going to buy it for myself, as I consider it a ""keeper"" that I will likely watch many times.I read the book ""Christy"" when it first came out many years ago, and I loved it at the time. I don't remember all the details of the book, as it's been so long since I read it, so I can't vouch for how closely the TV series followed the book. I do plan to read the book again soon, now that I've started watching these DVDs! However, from the other reviews I get the impression it's pretty true to the book.The cast is superb, the location gorgeous. I have fallen so in love with these characters and the way they are portrayed. I just borrowed from the library one of the other Christy movies that followed this series. I haven't watched it yet, but just by looking at the picture on the cover, I don't think I will like the cast as much as the original series. I do see that Dr. MacNeill is played by the same actor, Stewart Finlay-McLellan, who is wonderful.I highly recommend this DVD set.
