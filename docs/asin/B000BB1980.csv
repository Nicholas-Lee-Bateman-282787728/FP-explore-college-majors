If you're familiar with some of Klimov's other works you'll understand his knack for twisting the psyche of his audience with tormenting visions and macabre sound arrangements, and this film will certianly please you, if insanity is what you like. I find his movies must be watched several times to absorb their rich visual explosion fully, and I particularly love the use of stock footage of various stages of Russion history to better describe the plot and that which is going on surrounding the main characters. This movie is also hugely accurate and displays the true human existence behind the figures involved as it is rarely told. A must see, as the cliche goes.",5,Insanity,1189987200,"09 17, 2007",2007,694,"['movie', 'fantastic', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'Klimov', 'other', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'knack', 'twisting', 'psyche', 'audience', 'tormenting', 'visions', 'macabre', 'sound', 'arrangements', 'film', 'will', 'certianly', 'please', 'insanity', 'what', 'like', 'find', 'movies', 'must', 'be', 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'absorb', 'rich', 'visual', 'explosion', 'fully', 'particularly', 'love', 'use', 'stock', 'footage', 'various', 'stages', 'Russion', 'history', 'better', 'describe', 'plot', 'going', 'surrounding', 'main', 'characters', 'movie', 'also', 'hugely', 'accurate', 'true', 'human', 'existence', 'figures', 'involved', 'rarely', 'told', 'must', 'see', 'cliche']",N/A

Contrary to cheesy Hollywood versions portraying the monster opposite some youths in love, this film takes you to the reality of Russian ruling class in the early years of XX century. It is not about one person, it shows the agony of the whole system at the dawn of the October 1917 revolution. The Tzar with his weaknesses, the nobles with their arrogance and uselessness, the bureaucrats with their greed; and amongst them all, this strange and horrific figure who appeared out of nowhere as some kind of evil genius or, maybe, a personification of all Russian folk.The film creates incredibly authentic atmosphere of the time, focusing mostly on macabre side(considering the subject).  The  acting is absolutely superb.",5,a must see,1131321600,"11 7, 2005",2005,792,"['Definitely', 'best', 'film', 'notorious', 'man', 'Russian', 'history', 'Contrary', 'cheesy', 'Hollywood', 'versions', 'portraying', 'monster', 'opposite', 'youths', 'love', 'film', 'reality', 'Russian', 'ruling', 'class', 'early', 'years', 'XX', 'century', 'not', 'one', 'person', 'agony', 'whole', 'system', 'dawn', 'October', '1917', 'revolution', 'Tzar', 'weaknesses', 'nobles', 'arrogance', 'uselessness', 'bureaucrats', 'greed', 'amongst', 'strange', 'horrific', 'figure', 'who', 'appeared', 'nowhere', 'kind', 'evil', 'genius', 'maybe', 'personification', 'Russian', 'folk.The', 'film', 'incredibly', 'authentic', 'atmosphere', 'time', 'focusing', 'mostly', 'macabre', 'side', 'considering', 'subject', 'acting', 'absolutely', 'superb']",N/A

As the Anti-Christ, in the flesh,  in addition to the bells and whistles,  no nation would want to claim him as a fruit of their soil. Yet Shakespeare would have had a ball with Rasputin because he was a complex man with a wide human spectrum;  poised between spiritual devotion, will-full-ness and debauchy. What has been lost to history is what must have been the man's INNER sense of humour since just being very evil  or a reveller would deny the subtle intelligence he started out with,  or the kindness and compassion to heal the boy-tsar.This film does nothing but villify Rasputin and skips the stages of his development  into maturity ,which, reading between the lines in his biographies, is evident. Instead the film merely depicts his Agony at being force fed the karma of his own villainy. Incase we are in any doubt of his intrinsic nature, the director resorts to a direct allusion to the famous film,  Ivan the Terrible.Especially  the shot which replicates a characature of Ivan The Terrible,  standing  infront of a window,  using the same stance and pointy, cutlass beard : Rasputin never washed , much less styled his beard.He was also known for his pale, blue , hypnotic, mystical eyes ; quite wierdly outlined in dark shadows. It is also the most startling thing about him in photographs .How can any film-maker on Rasputin omit  this? No  attempt was made,  in casting,  to find anyone looking remotely like him. The Rasputin in Agony had mundane brown eyes,  which is flabbergasting.The director insists on him becoming full of the Agony of panic towards the end. Yet if he could draw upon a deep peace, strong enough to relax  a haemophillic child into a type of coma, which stilled everything enough for his blood to coagulate, then surely he could relax himself enough to stay cool under pressure. It is quite possible he foresaw hisend was nigh, as has been known to occur to lesser mortals.Although there is no denying he was a dangerous rogue also.Why a filmaker/s would go to such lenghs to transform Rasputin into a poor devil is intriguing. In hindsight it's clear he didn't bring down the Romanovs but was more a target amongst the unrest in Russia. But punishment and self-inflicted mental angst figure largely in this film. I think there is a religious motive since he was as pious as he was ""devilish"" . It's a contradiction that sits uneasily with believers especially since he was powerful nonetheless ; through a meditative mind and training as a monk wether that was used to serve God as much as himself. Rather than deal with someone who could be both healer and letch,  for example,  the filmaker/s flatten him into a one-dimentional poor devil. To me,  Rasputin had all the gifts and pitfalls of an evolved astral body that has little to do with a sublimation ofSelf in God and there won't be a movie that gets to grips with him psychologically unless from a secular perspective.",2,deliberate distortion of an important historical figure,1340841600,"06 28, 2012",2012,3045,"['Rasputin', 'national', 'disgrace', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Russian', 'film-maker', 'be', 'making', 'anything', 'worthy', 'coming', 'way', 'soon', 'Anti-Christ', 'flesh', 'addition', 'bells', 'whistles', 'nation', 'would', 'want', 'claim', 'fruit', 'soil', 'Shakespeare', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'ball', 'Rasputin', 'was', 'complex', 'man', 'wide', 'human', 'spectrum', 'poised', 'spiritual', 'devotion', 'will-full-ness', 'debauchy', 'What', 'been', 'lost', 'history', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'man', 'INNER', 'sense', 'humour', 'just', 'being', 'very', 'evil', 'reveller', 'would', 'deny', 'subtle', 'intelligence', 'started', 'out', 'kindness', 'compassion', 'heal', 'boy-tsar.This', 'film', 'nothing', 'villify', 'Rasputin', 'stages', 'development', 'maturity', 'reading', 'lines', 'biographies', 'evident', 'Instead', 'film', 'merely', 'Agony', 'being', 'force', 'fed', 'karma', 'own', 'villainy', 'Incase', 'are', 'doubt', 'intrinsic', 'nature', 'director', 'direct', 'allusion', 'famous', 'film', 'Ivan', 'Terrible.Especially', 'shot', 'characature', 'Ivan', 'Terrible', 'standing', 'infront', 'window', 'using', 'same', 'stance', 'pointy', 'cutlass', 'beard', 'Rasputin', 'never', 'washed', 'much', 'less', 'styled', 'beard.He', 'was', 'also', 'known', 'pale', 'blue', 'hypnotic', 'mystical', 'eyes', 'quite', 'wierdly', 'outlined', 'dark', 'shadows', 'also', 'most', 'startling', 'thing', 'photographs', '.How', 'can', 'film-maker', 'Rasputin', 'omit', 'attempt', 'was', 'made', 'casting', 'find', 'anyone', 'looking', 'remotely', 'Rasputin', 'Agony', 'had', 'mundane', 'brown', 'eyes', 'flabbergasting.The', 'director', 'insists', 'becoming', 'full', 'Agony', 'panic', 'end', 'could', 'draw', 'deep', 'peace', 'strong', 'enough', 'relax', 'haemophillic', 'child', 'type', 'coma', 'stilled', 'everything', 'enough', 'blood', 'coagulate', 'then', 'surely', 'could', 'relax', 'enough', 'stay', 'cool', 'pressure', 'quite', 'possible', 'foresaw', 'hisend', 'was', 'nigh', 'been', 'known', 'occur', 'lesser', 'denying', 'was', 'dangerous', 'rogue', 'filmaker/s', 'would', 'go', 'such', 'lenghs', 'transform', 'Rasputin', 'poor', 'devil', 'intriguing', 'hindsight', 'clear', 'did', ""n't"", 'bring', 'down', 'Romanovs', 'was', 'more', 'target', 'unrest', 'Russia', 'punishment', 'self-inflicted', 'mental', 'angst', 'figure', 'largely', 'film', 'think', 'religious', 'motive', 'was', 'as', 'pious', 'was', 'devilish', 'contradiction', 'uneasily', 'believers', 'especially', 'was', 'powerful', 'nonetheless', 'meditative', 'mind', 'training', 'monk', 'wether', 'was', 'used', 'serve', 'God', 'as', 'much', 'Rather', 'deal', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'healer', 'letch', 'example', 'filmaker/s', 'flatten', 'one-dimentional', 'poor', 'devil', 'Rasputin', 'had', 'gifts', 'pitfalls', 'evolved', 'astral', 'body', 'little', 'do', 'sublimation', 'God', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'movie', 'grips', 'psychologically', 'secular', 'perspective']",N/A
938737,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B000BB1980,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[18, 19]","This is one of the greatest Russian films ever made, but it's not particularly well known in this country, even in cinema circles.  It's directed by Elem Kilmov, who directed the masterful Come and See.  The film is excellent for many reasons.  One, it gives a very well rounded portrait of the Russian monarchy at the time, and the complete chaos in the house of Nicholas II (and Russia during his reign).  Second, the portrayal of Rasputin here is amazing (by Alexi Pentrenko), and extremely accurate.  He was a very unkept man, but he had amazing charisma and he had carte blanche in the household of Nicholas II (which he abused regularly).  There are some wicked surreal touches that really make this film extraordinary.  As an added bonus, this is the widescreen, uncut version.  When the film made it to the states, the film was cut by 35 minutes.  Previous VHS versions were also pan and scan, which butchered Kilmov's widescreen compositions.  The film had difficulty in the USSR as well, because the Soviet censors felt that Kilmov was too sympathetic towards Nicholas II.  It was made in 1974, but wasn't officially released until 1985.  This is a great Russian film, one of the best portrayals of Rasputin and the fall of Nicholas II.",5,One of the most unheralded Russian films ever....,1177891200,"04 30, 2007",2007,1246,"['one', 'greatest', 'Russian', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'not', 'particularly', 'well', 'known', 'country', 'even', 'cinema', 'circles', 'directed', 'Elem', 'Kilmov', 'who', 'directed', 'masterful', 'Come', 'See', 'film', 'excellent', 'many', 'reasons', 'One', 'very', 'well', 'rounded', 'portrait', 'Russian', 'monarchy', 'time', 'complete', 'chaos', 'house', 'Nicholas', 'II', 'Russia', 'reign', 'Second', 'portrayal', 'Rasputin', 'here', 'amazing', 'Alexi', 'Pentrenko', 'extremely', 'accurate', 'was', 'very', 'unkept', 'man', 'had', 'amazing', 'charisma', 'had', 'carte', 'blanche', 'household', 'Nicholas', 'II', 'abused', 'regularly', 'are', 'wicked', 'surreal', 'touches', 'really', 'make', 'film', 'extraordinary', 'added', 'bonus', 'widescreen', 'uncut', 'version', 'When', 'film', 'made', 'states', 'film', 'was', 'cut', '35', 'minutes', 'Previous', 'VHS', 'versions', 'were', 'also', 'pan', 'scan', 'butchered', 'Kilmov', 'widescreen', 'compositions', 'film', 'had', 'difficulty', 'USSR', 'as', 'well', 'Soviet', 'censors', 'felt', 'Kilmov', 'was', 'too', 'sympathetic', 'towards', 'Nicholas', 'II', 'was', 'made', '1974', 'was', ""n't"", 'officially', 'released', '1985', 'great', 'Russian', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'portrayals', 'Rasputin', 'fall', 'Nicholas', 'II']",N/A
