The final straw for me was when the kid said his favorite game was the&#34;1980 US vs Russia Olympic game at Lake Placid for the Gold Medal&#34; ... That game was not the Gold Medal game. The Americans still had to beat Finland to earn their gold medal.,2,Couldn't hardly watch it.,1395014400,"03 17, 2014",2014,293,"['Not', 'well', 'done', 'Acting', 'was', 'awful', 'final', 'straw', 'was', 'when', 'kid', 'said', 'favorite', 'game', 'was', '34', '1980', 'US', 'vs', 'Russia', 'Olympic', 'game', 'Lake', 'Placid', 'Gold', 'Medal', '34', 'game', 'was', 'not', 'Gold', 'Medal', 'game', 'Americans', 'still', 'had', 'beat', 'Finland', 'earn', 'gold', 'medal']",N/A

1282949,A1JRVSVHBHB7VB,B002PI1NSI,"M. Soltys ""nari solstice""","[0, 0]",This movie is base on a true story of a pee-wee hockey team for the USA back in 2003 that went to Canada to play a game and got mistreated by most of the adults because the Iraqu war had just started and Canada didnt like the USA for dragging them into it. (guilt by asosiation). The refs were failing to give the US  any calls on penalties by the second half of the game it was 8-0 Canada and even the canadian coach was calling the refs on their bad sportsmanship. US team walk out before the game was over which was called forfit. One of the kids on the Canadian team knew it was unfair what happened the team so he work to get the team back to have a fare rematch. And he did. Wont ruin the ending; just know good wins out.,4,Great teamwork movie,1350950400,"10 23, 2012",2012,727,"['movie', 'base', 'true', 'story', 'pee-wee', 'hockey', 'team', 'USA', 'back', '2003', 'went', 'Canada', 'play', 'game', 'got', 'mistreated', 'most', 'adults', 'Iraqu', 'war', 'had', 'just', 'started', 'Canada', 'didnt', 'USA', 'dragging', 'guilt', 'asosiation', 'refs', 'were', 'failing', 'give', 'US', 'calls', 'penalties', 'second', 'half', 'game', 'was', '8-0', 'Canada', 'even', 'canadian', 'coach', 'was', 'calling', 'refs', 'bad', 'sportsmanship', 'US', 'team', 'walk', 'game', 'was', 'was', 'called', 'forfit', 'One', 'kids', 'Canadian', 'team', 'knew', 'was', 'unfair', 'what', 'happened', 'team', 'so', 'work', 'get', 'team', 'back', 'have', 'fare', 'rematch', 'did', 'Wont', 'ruin', 'ending', 'just', 'know', 'good', 'wins', 'out']",N/A
1282950,A1UIZVPLOSEG44,B002PI1NSI,Pistol King,"[0, 1]",I am a huge hockey fan.  I purchased this video as a Christmas gift for my 4 year old hockey loving son.  I didn't really care for the movie at all and neither did he.  Perhaps it is way past my time and way too mature for him.  It does have a decent premise but it just wasn't all that great of a film.  Less talking and more playing would have made this film much better.  ACTION....it's what hockey is about!  That was lost a bit in this movie.,4,Sticks and boredom,1367020800,"04 27, 2013",2013,447,"['am', 'huge', 'hockey', 'fan', 'purchased', 'video', 'Christmas', 'gift', '4', 'year', 'old', 'hockey', 'loving', 'son', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'movie', 'neither', 'did', 'Perhaps', 'way', 'time', 'way', 'too', 'mature', 'have', 'decent', 'premise', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'film', 'talking', 'more', 'playing', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'ACTION', '.it', 'what', 'hockey', 'was', 'lost', 'bit', 'movie']",N/A
