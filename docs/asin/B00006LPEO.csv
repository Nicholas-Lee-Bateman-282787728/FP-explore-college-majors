720547,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B00006LPEO,Bobby Underwood,"[6, 6]","""You know something funny? He didn't mention you either.""Margaret Sullavan's waif-like delicacy proved perfect for this Wiliam Wyler film adaptation of Ferenc Molnar's fanciful play about a young orphan who causes confusion by trying to do a good deed and ends up finding love in the process. Wyler also fell under Sullavan's spell while filming this and the two became a couple.A fabulous cast that includes Frank Morgan, Herbert Marshall, Eric Blore, Beulah Bondi, and Reginald Owen in a comic gem of a performance, act out Preston Sturges screenplay to marvelous perfection. Wyler and Sullavan let the charm slowly build, each new ingredient adding to its flavor until this sweet and delicate confection can't be resisted.Luisa (Margaret Sullavan) gets a chance to leave the orphanage for the first time to work as an usherette in a movie theatre called The Dream Palace. It is there that she meets waiter Reginald Owen and they have a fanciful friendship, he trying the entire film to protect her innocence from Frank Morgan's Konrad, a rich meat exporter who has fallen under Sullavan's spell, not fully realizing she is genuine.Complications arise when she makes up a white lie about being already married and picks idealistic lawyer, Max Sporum, out of the phone book to be her wedded husband. He falls under Sullavan's spell also, but totally unaware that Konrad has made him a rich attorney because Luisa is his good fairy. Luisa falls under the spell of Max's simple yet charming ideals until the inevitable occurs and everyone discovers the truth.Frothy and lighter than air, this film slowly works its way into your heart until you too fall under Sullavan's spell. Owen is terrific as her protector and has some wonderful moments. Perhaps the most memorable scene is between Luisa and Max on the phone, when she tells him tearfully, ""Think of me kindly. Almost--almost as if I loved you.""This early 1930's film has a bit of sophistication similar to foreign films which requires more of an attention span than filmgoers of today are used to having to muster but is well worth the effort. Remade in a slightly more American fashion as a Deanna Durbin vehicle, ""I'll Be Yours,"" also highly recommended, film buffs, and fans of Sullavan especially, don't want to miss this one.",5,Delicate Charm,1193011200,"10 22, 2007",2007,2286,"['know', 'something', 'funny', 'did', ""n't"", 'mention', 'either', 'Margaret', 'Sullavan', 'waif-like', 'delicacy', 'proved', 'perfect', 'Wiliam', 'Wyler', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Ferenc', 'Molnar', 'fanciful', 'play', 'young', 'orphan', 'who', 'confusion', 'trying', 'do', 'good', 'deed', 'up', 'finding', 'love', 'process', 'Wyler', 'also', 'fell', 'Sullavan', 'spell', 'filming', 'two', 'became', 'couple.A', 'fabulous', 'cast', 'Frank', 'Morgan', 'Herbert', 'Marshall', 'Eric', 'Blore', 'Beulah', 'Bondi', 'Reginald', 'Owen', 'comic', 'gem', 'performance', 'act', 'out', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'screenplay', 'marvelous', 'perfection', 'Wyler', 'Sullavan', 'let', 'charm', 'slowly', 'build', 'new', 'ingredient', 'adding', 'flavor', 'sweet', 'delicate', 'confection', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'resisted.Luisa', 'Margaret', 'Sullavan', 'chance', 'leave', 'orphanage', 'first', 'time', 'work', 'usherette', 'movie', 'theatre', 'called', 'Dream', 'Palace', 'there', 'waiter', 'Reginald', 'Owen', 'have', 'fanciful', 'friendship', 'trying', 'entire', 'film', 'protect', 'innocence', 'Frank', 'Morgan', 'Konrad', 'rich', 'meat', 'exporter', 'who', 'fallen', 'Sullavan', 'spell', 'not', 'fully', 'realizing', 'genuine.Complications', 'arise', 'when', 'up', 'white', 'lie', 'being', 'already', 'married', 'picks', 'idealistic', 'lawyer', 'Max', 'Sporum', 'phone', 'book', 'be', 'wedded', 'husband', 'Sullavan', 'spell', 'also', 'totally', 'unaware', 'Konrad', 'made', 'rich', 'attorney', 'Luisa', 'good', 'fairy', 'Luisa', 'spell', 'Max', 'simple', 'yet', 'charming', 'ideals', 'inevitable', 'occurs', 'everyone', 'truth.Frothy', 'lighter', 'air', 'film', 'slowly', 'way', 'heart', 'too', 'fall', 'Sullavan', 'spell', 'Owen', 'terrific', 'protector', 'wonderful', 'moments', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'memorable', 'scene', 'Luisa', 'Max', 'phone', 'when', 'tearfully', 'Think', 'kindly', 'Almost', 'almost', 'loved', 'early', '1930', 'film', 'bit', 'sophistication', 'similar', 'foreign', 'films', 'more', 'attention', 'span', 'filmgoers', 'today', 'are', 'used', 'having', 'muster', 'well', 'effort', 'Remade', 'slightly', 'more', 'American', 'fashion', 'Deanna', 'Durbin', 'vehicle', ""'ll"", 'Be', 'Yours', 'also', 'highly', 'recommended', 'film', 'buffs', 'fans', 'Sullavan', 'especially', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'one']",N/A
720548,A2BIK37ZMXKW91,B00006LPEO,"brian komyathy ""Thanks for scouting out my pa...","[5, 6]","The 1930s were a great decade for film; of the grand sort, the likes of Gone with the Wind et al., and also for the just darn likable sort such as The Good Fairy.  The details of this film are not particularly relevent (and have been summarized elsewhere here anyway).  Suffice it to say that this is a screwball comedy played out with refreshing aplomb.  Frank Morgan wonderfully displays here why ( I presume) they cast him as the Wizard of Oz.  He is all over Margaret Sullavan who plays ""The Good Fairy"" herein (What's your name? -I can't tell you. Oh, you're incognito. -No, you'll never guess it.) & is a hoot just to watch as he delivers clever lines in his amusing doubletake, hesitatingly timed, manner of speech. His style is very apropo thus to the material---his wooing of a naive gal who counterplays him to confused befuddlement.  If you are a fan of his wizard and Prof Marvel roles then you'd probably welcome simply seeing this film just for that; but that this film is rather enjoyable too---albeit lighthearted (hence the 3 stars)---makes it all the more worthwhile seeing; & especially so if you are a 1930s fan and have yet to see this film.

720549,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B00006LPEO,Byron Kolln,"[1, 1]","William Wyler tries his hand at Lubitsch-meets-Molnar territory in 1935's THE GOOD FAIRY - and the results are charming.  Not as well known for his light comedies, THE GOOD FAIRY is an often forgotten title in Wyler's repertoire, but why is a real mystery to me.  It's a sheer delight from beginning to end.When Budapest movie palace manager Maurice Schlapkohl (Alan Hale) needs new girls for usherettes, he calls into the Municipal Orphanage, where he encounters Luisa Ginglebusher (Margaret Sullavan).  In no time Luisa swaps her gingham smock for an usherette uniform, yet she keeps the advice given to her by the kindly orphanage mistress (Beulah Bondi), to strive in performing one good deed a day.  Luisa's ""deed"" becomes a mission to become a Good Fairy to Dr. Sporum (Herbert Marshall), an impoverished lawyer.  By referring to Sporum as her ""husband"", Luisa is able to assist him financially - with the money of Konrad (Frank Morgan), an older society gent who wants more than friendship from Luisa in return!Headed by a winning performance from Margaret Sullavan, THE GOOD FAIRY is indeed a breezy delight.  Screenwriter Preston Sturges retains the European flavour of the original play by Ferenc Molnar (""Lilliom"", ""The Shop Around the Corner"") which had starred Helen Hayes on Broadway in 1931.  THE GOOD FAIRY was where Sullavan and Wyler's tempestuous marriage started.  They eloped towards the end of the filming schedule.  Sullavan is all tomboy in the opening scene at the Orphanage, entertaining the smaller children with a hair-raising fairytale; but once she hits the movie palace in her jaunty Hussar's hat and usherette uniform, watch out!  She's dazzling here.Frank Morgan is his blustery, befuddled best as Lu's would-be seducer; and Herbert Marshall is appropriately Molnar-esque in his performance as the lawyer.  It's all put together beautifully (the scenes in the sparkling Schlapkohl cinema palace evoke an era in moviegoing I sadly doubt we'll ever see again).  Whilst William Wyler's great acclaim came with his dramas (including ""Dodsworth"", ""Jezebel"" and ""The Letter""), he does give THE GOOD FAIRY an airy touch that's quite apart from most of his other films.  Perhaps it was his unfolding romance with Margaret Sullavan during filming or his affinity with the subject.THE GOOD FAIRY would be re-made by Universal again in 1947 asI'll Be Yourswith Deanna Durbin, and musicalized on Broadway in 1951 as ""Make a Wish"", starring Nanette Fabray as Janette (Luisa).Extras on this DVD are limited to the trailer, and a gallery of candid pictures provided by the Wyler Family Estate.

720550,A2ZA2FUK6UVRNX,B00006LPEO,Donald Rogers,"[5, 5]","This is an enjoyable minor comedy. Set in Hungary and based on a Molnar play, it is somewhat reminiscent of Lubitsch's earlier Trouble in Paradise (which also starred Herbert Marshall) and his later The Shop Around the Corner (which also had Margaret Sullavan and Frank Morgan). To say those Lubitsch films are better than The Good Fairy -- which they are -- is to praise with faint damnation, as they are all-time classic comedies.William Wyler is celebrated for his dramatic, not his comedic flair, but there is nothing seriously wrong with his direction here. The work he gets out of his then-wife Margaret Sullavan is charmingly winning, as it needs to be. Sturges' script has flashes of his later style, but he was not yet as adept at working around the censors as he later grew to become, and the second half of the film is a bit stagy and contrived. Still, this is an amusing and little-seen mid-30's comedy that will be appreciated by fans of Sullavan, Morgan, Wyler, Sturges... and Lubitsch.As for the Kino DVD itself, the ""extras"" are very thin (just the preview and some Wyler family photographs) but the print is gorgeous.  It must have been digitally cleaned up somehow -- new film doesn't look this good. The sound is excellent, too.

720551,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00006LPEO,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 3]","Five years before she butted heads with James Stewart working at Matuschek and Co. in Ernst Lubitsch's classic pen-pal romance,The Shop Around The Corner, Margaret Sullavan was playing another character living in Budapest, this time a nave young woman chosen to become an usherette in an elaborate movie palace. This warm-hearted 1935 screwball comedy has impressive credentials beyond a luminous Sullavan in only her third film, as it offers a screenplay by Preston Sturges (The Lady Eve) and direction from William Wyler (The Best Years of Our Lives) who married Sullavan during the tempestuous production. Alas, this was their only collaboration since they divorced less than two years later, but this long-forgotten collaboration is a fruitful one as the then-25-year-old actress sparkles in a role that could have easily been cloying if Wyler didn't maintain the right tempo for Sturges' alternately scatterbrained and clever story.Sullavan plays the improbably named Luisa Ginglebusher, a gregarious, pig-tailed orphan who regales the younger girls with her fanciful fairy tales. A blustery theater owner comes to the orphanage looking for girls to be silver-costumed usherettes at his Budapest movie palace. The head of the orphanage allows Luisa to accept the job on the condition that she performs at least one good deed a day in the real world. At the theater, Luisa meets Detlaff, a waiter who gets her an invitation to an exclusive party at which he is serving. She almost immediately has to hold off the bold advances of Konrad, a somewhat lascivious South American meat-packing millionaire who wants to seduce her and shower her with gifts. However, she isn't interested and lies about being married. When he insists on employing her ""husband"" so he can send him away, Luisa randomly picks a name from the phone book, hoping to do a good deed and divert some of Konrad's wealth to someone else. The lucky man is poor but proud Dr. Max Sporum, but complications obviously ensue when Luisa meets Sporum and Konrad finds out the truth.Although she had few opportunities to play comedy, the adorable Sullavan shines in this type of shenanigan-driven farce, whether using her electric wand to point patrons to their theater seats or prancing with a multiplicity of her mirror images as she models a ""foxine"" stole at the department store. Reginald Owen (Scrooge in the 1938A Christmas Carol) gamely plays Detlaff with rubbery charm, while Frank Morgan (the Wizard inThe Wizard of Oz) is a bit too fey and downright wizardly as Konrad. Generally a tight-lipped presence on the screen, Herbert Marshall (The Little Foxes) has never appeared more animated in a movie than he does as Sporum. Familiar character actors show up like Alan Hale as the cinema impresario, Beulah Bondi as the orphanage matron, a hilariously over-the-top Eric Blore (from all the early Fred-and-Ginger pictures) as a monocled drunk, and a menacing Cesar Romero as a pushy stage-door lothario. An unusual entry on Wyler's resume, this is quite a charmer thanks to Sullavan. The print is clear on the 2002 DVD, which includes the original theatrical trailer and a photo gallery as extras.",4,An Elfin Sullavan Charms in a Fanciful Budapest-Set Fable,1322092800,"11 24, 2011",2011,3168,"['Five', 'years', 'butted', 'heads', 'James', 'Stewart', 'working', 'Matuschek', 'Co.', 'Ernst', 'Lubitsch', 'classic', 'pen-pal', 'romance', 'Shop', 'Corner', 'Margaret', 'Sullavan', 'was', 'playing', 'character', 'living', 'Budapest', 'time', 'nave', 'young', 'woman', 'chosen', 'become', 'usherette', 'elaborate', 'movie', 'palace', 'warm-hearted', '1935', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'impressive', 'credentials', 'luminous', 'Sullavan', 'only', 'third', 'film', 'screenplay', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'Lady', 'Eve', 'direction', 'William', 'Wyler', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', 'who', 'married', 'Sullavan', 'tempestuous', 'production', 'Alas', 'was', 'only', 'collaboration', 'divorced', 'less', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'long-forgotten', 'collaboration', 'fruitful', 'one', 'then-25-year-old', 'actress', 'sparkles', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'cloying', 'Wyler', 'did', ""n't"", 'maintain', 'right', 'tempo', 'Sturges', 'alternately', 'scatterbrained', 'clever', 'story.Sullavan', 'improbably', 'named', 'Luisa', 'Ginglebusher', 'gregarious', 'pig-tailed', 'orphan', 'who', 'younger', 'girls', 'fanciful', 'fairy', 'tales', 'blustery', 'theater', 'owner', 'orphanage', 'looking', 'girls', 'be', 'silver-costumed', 'usherettes', 'Budapest', 'movie', 'palace', 'head', 'orphanage', 'Luisa', 'accept', 'job', 'condition', 'least', 'one', 'good', 'deed', 'day', 'real', 'world', 'theater', 'Luisa', 'Detlaff', 'waiter', 'who', 'invitation', 'exclusive', 'party', 'serving', 'almost', 'immediately', 'hold', 'off', 'bold', 'advances', 'Konrad', 'somewhat', 'lascivious', 'South', 'American', 'meat-packing', 'millionaire', 'who', 'seduce', 'shower', 'gifts', 'However', ""n't"", 'interested', 'being', 'married', 'When', 'employing', 'husband', 'can', 'send', 'away', 'Luisa', 'randomly', 'name', 'phone', 'book', 'hoping', 'do', 'good', 'deed', 'divert', 'Konrad', 'wealth', 'someone', 'else', 'lucky', 'man', 'poor', 'proud', 'Dr.', 'Max', 'Sporum', 'complications', 'obviously', 'ensue', 'when', 'Luisa', 'Sporum', 'Konrad', 'out', 'truth.Although', 'had', 'few', 'opportunities', 'play', 'comedy', 'adorable', 'Sullavan', 'shines', 'type', 'shenanigan-driven', 'farce', 'using', 'electric', 'wand', 'point', 'patrons', 'theater', 'seats', 'prancing', 'multiplicity', 'mirror', 'images', 'models', 'foxine', 'stole', 'department', 'store', 'Reginald', 'Owen', 'Scrooge', '1938A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'gamely', 'Detlaff', 'rubbery', 'charm', 'Frank', 'Morgan', 'Wizard', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'bit', 'too', 'fey', 'downright', 'wizardly', 'Konrad', 'Generally', 'tight-lipped', 'presence', 'screen', 'Herbert', 'Marshall', 'Little', 'Foxes', 'never', 'appeared', 'more', 'animated', 'movie', 'Sporum', 'Familiar', 'character', 'actors', 'show', 'up', 'Alan', 'Hale', 'cinema', 'impresario', 'Beulah', 'Bondi', 'orphanage', 'matron', 'hilariously', 'over-the-top', 'Eric', 'Blore', 'early', 'Fred-and-Ginger', 'pictures', 'monocled', 'drunk', 'menacing', 'Cesar', 'Romero', 'pushy', 'stage-door', 'lothario', 'unusual', 'entry', 'Wyler', 'resume', 'quite', 'charmer', 'thanks', 'Sullavan', 'print', 'clear', '2002', 'DVD', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'photo', 'gallery', 'extras']",N/A

She plays Luisa, a completely unworldly orphan hired from her orphanage to work in a movie theatre as an usherette by Alan Hale. Hale is the first of a series of &quot;good fairies&quot; who come to Luisa and try to transform her life: the other is Herbert Marshall (as a grouchy waiter), Frank Morgan (as an amorous millionaire) and Reginald Owen (as a poor lawyer)--but all the while it's Luisa who thinks she's acting the role of Good Fairy to them. The script (Preston Sturges's re-write of a Molnar play) here is so superb (and constantly surprising) that you would have thought it was exactly tailored to the various actors' talents: none of them have ever been funnier. But even when none of them are onscreen (in the hilarious movie-within-amovie sequence) it's still funny. Sullavan took this role (she acted only infrequently onscreen, much preferring the stage) to improve her comedy skills, but she's absolutely peerless: her delight over her &quot;genuine foxine&quot; tippet near the movie's end, and her subsequent bickering over its beauty with Morgan, are indescribably charming.",5,One of the funniest (and least known) Thirties comedies,1058140800,"07 14, 2003",2003,1221,"['Very', 'few', 'people', 'know', 'delightful', 'gem', '1935', 'starring', 'sublime', 'Margaret', 'Sullavan', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'parts', 'Luisa', 'completely', 'unworldly', 'orphan', 'hired', 'orphanage', 'work', 'movie', 'theatre', 'usherette', 'Alan', 'Hale', 'Hale', 'first', 'series', 'quot', 'good', 'fairies', 'quot', 'who', 'come', 'Luisa', 'try', 'transform', 'life', 'other', 'Herbert', 'Marshall', 'grouchy', 'waiter', 'Frank', 'Morgan', 'amorous', 'millionaire', 'Reginald', 'Owen', 'poor', 'lawyer', 'Luisa', 'who', 'acting', 'role', 'Good', 'Fairy', 'script', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 're-write', 'Molnar', 'play', 'here', 'so', 'superb', 'constantly', 'surprising', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'was', 'exactly', 'tailored', 'various', 'actors', 'talents', 'none', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'funnier', 'even', 'when', 'none', 'are', 'onscreen', 'hilarious', 'movie-within-amovie', 'sequence', 'still', 'funny', 'Sullavan', 'took', 'role', 'acted', 'only', 'infrequently', 'onscreen', 'much', 'preferring', 'stage', 'improve', 'comedy', 'skills', 'absolutely', 'peerless', 'delight', 'quot', 'genuine', 'foxine', 'quot', 'movie', 'end', 'subsequent', 'bickering', 'beauty', 'Morgan', 'are', 'indescribably', 'charming']",N/A

What's different here, and one of the things that makes this film unique, is the Preston Sturges screenplay, which puts such a strong stamp of Sturges's style on the film that it really deserves to be called a Preston Sturges film as much as a William Wyler one. All the characteristic Sturges elements are here: the combination of subtlety and slapstick, the credible development of a comic situation which starts simply and rapidly becomes absurdly complicated, continual rapid-fire action and repartee, and an atmosphere of sophisticated sex farce overlaying a surprisingly cynical vision of relations between the sexes. Margaret Sullavan is enchanting as the naive do-gooder orphan suddenly dumped into the real world, and Herbert Marshall as a lawyer who is something of a young fogey steers an exactly right course between pomposity and idealism. Some of the comic sequences -- for instance, the attempted seduction dinner which is disastrously thwarted by a combination of the orphan's innocence and the machinations of the waiter to make it impossible for them to order, are as funny as anything in film.Should you see it? I'd recommend this film to everyone. It's a thoroughly entertaining comedy which is also a first rate piece of film making by everyone involved.

The image of Miss Sullavan on the DVD cover, which makes her look like a toy soldier, is a depiction of her character in her uniform as an usher at a movie palace.

Secondly, Frank Morgan of the Wizard of Oz is a lecherous old business man.  This is quite a change for him.Secondly, let's discuss European movies of the 1930s. By this I mean Hollywood movies set in Europe.  In the 1930s it was customary to set these movies in Europe with European names, European place names, and European money.  Three movies come to mind: Grand Hotel (1930), Shop Around the Corner (1940), and this one. In recent years it has become customary to set these movies in the US. The example is You've Got Mail (1998) with Meg Ryan. As you know, this movie was a remake of Shop Around the Corner but set in New York.The interesting thing about The Good Fairy is that the heroine's last name is Ginglebush. This name was meant to be not only funny to US audiences but to the other characters in the movie.  Lu (Margaret Sullavan) was advised not to reveal this name. This little touch was a cultural insight.All in all, this was a delightful European farce.",4,A Rare Gem,1373760000,"07 14, 2013",2013,1405,"['movie', 'fascinating', 'two', 'points', 'view', 'first', 'farce', 'secondly', 'European', 'movie', '1930s', 'farce', 'many', 'unexpected', 'things', 'happen', 'example', 'heroine', 'future', 'husband', 'phone', 'book', 'refreshing', 'change', 'trite', 'plots', '1930s', 'refreshing', 'surprise', 'Herbert', 'Marshall', 'romantic', 'lead', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'have', 'seen', 'romantic', 'lead', 'other', 'movie', 'Secondly', 'Frank', 'Morgan', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'lecherous', 'old', 'business', 'man', 'quite', 'change', 'him.Secondly', 'let', 'discuss', 'European', 'movies', '1930s', 'mean', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'set', 'Europe', '1930s', 'was', 'customary', 'set', 'movies', 'Europe', 'European', 'names', 'European', 'place', 'names', 'European', 'money', 'Three', 'movies', 'come', 'mind', 'Grand', 'Hotel', '1930', 'Shop', 'Corner', '1940', 'one', 'recent', 'years', 'become', 'customary', 'set', 'movies', 'US', 'example', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Mail', '1998', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'know', 'movie', 'was', 'remake', 'Shop', 'Corner', 'set', 'New', 'York.The', 'interesting', 'thing', 'Good', 'Fairy', 'heroine', 'last', 'name', 'Ginglebush', 'name', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'not', 'only', 'funny', 'US', 'audiences', 'other', 'characters', 'movie', 'Lu', 'Margaret', 'Sullavan', 'was', 'advised', 'not', 'reveal', 'name', 'little', 'touch', 'was', 'cultural', 'insight.All', 'was', 'delightful', 'European', 'farce']",N/A
