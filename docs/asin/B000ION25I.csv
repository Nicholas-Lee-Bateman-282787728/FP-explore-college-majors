The interactions between the four are sometimes insightful, sometimes annoying, and often entertaining if not particularily hilarious. As a reality show it's ok and worth watching maybe once. But you know what would have made this show great? If it was funny. The standup routines including Dane Cook's might make you smile once or twice but there's little in the way of side splitting hilarity to be found. In fact there isn't any. No full set is provided either, rather just edited bits and pieces, dribs and drabs. For a reality show it's not bad, for a comedy dvd it's covered in flop sweat.",2,Succeeds where it doesn't really matter and fails where it shouldn't,1187654400,"08 21, 2007",2007,781,"['reality', 'show', 'staring', 'four', 'young', 'comics', 'traveling', 'country', 'distinct', 'personalities', 'styles', 'levels', 'experience', 'show', 'guess', ""'d"", 'call', 'amusing', 'interactions', 'four', 'are', 'sometimes', 'insightful', 'sometimes', 'annoying', 'often', 'entertaining', 'not', 'particularily', 'hilarious', 'reality', 'show', 'ok', 'worth', 'watching', 'maybe', 'once', 'know', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'show', 'great', 'was', 'funny', 'standup', 'routines', 'including', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'might', 'make', 'smile', 'once', 'twice', 'little', 'way', 'side', 'splitting', 'hilarity', 'be', 'found', 'fact', ""n't"", 'full', 'set', 'provided', 'either', 'rather', 'just', 'edited', 'bits', 'pieces', 'dribs', 'drabs', 'reality', 'show', 'not', 'bad', 'comedy', 'dvd', 'covered', 'flop', 'sweat']",Dane Cook's Tourgasm

The only reason I watched it is because I accidentally rented this instead of ""Dane Cook: Vicious Circle.""  The video store had the box in the wrong place. Figures.Anyway, I found the show completely fascinating. Due to the many bad reviews here, I had to throw in a good word to encourage others. I am not a die-hard Dane Cook fan like I know so many exist. I was an open-minded viewer expecting a bad show due to the Amazon reviews. Let's turn this around:In watching the performers off stage we are treated to four adults in four distinct stages of career and success. Invest the emotional time to compare where you are at in your life to these comics. I found myself relating to them differently at various points throughout. I was hooked from episode one when Jay and Bobby (definitely not Silent Bob) struck back at each other over the merits of porn.Their comedy pieces are alright. It's not the funniest comedy you will ever see presented here. Sometimes it feels like you're watching a train wreck. Or more accurately, like you are watching an episode of Project Greenlight where everything goes wrong. Watching them grow and adjust over the course of the episodes enthralled me.And the last episodes featuring Dane and the others before they were famous is absolutely priceless and very moving. These things seem drool-worthy to Cook fans: watching footage of Dane when he was a teen, returning to his old high school years later, re-reading the letter he wrote to himself years ago...again I wonder why the bad reviews?Anyone who appreciates human drama, sociology, psychology, or anyone who's ever had a dream to make it big will not be disappointed in this.",5,Give it a try!,1168041600,"01 6, 2007",2007,1743,"['bad', 'reviews', 'page', 'almost', 'kept', 'watching', 'show', 'only', 'reason', 'watched', 'accidentally', 'rented', 'instead', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'Vicious', 'Circle', 'video', 'store', 'had', 'box', 'wrong', 'place', 'Figures.Anyway', 'found', 'show', 'completely', 'fascinating', 'Due', 'many', 'bad', 'reviews', 'here', 'had', 'throw', 'good', 'word', 'encourage', 'others', 'am', 'not', 'die-hard', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'fan', 'know', 'so', 'many', 'exist', 'was', 'open-minded', 'viewer', 'expecting', 'bad', 'show', 'due', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'Let', 'turn', 'watching', 'performers', 'off', 'stage', 'are', 'treated', 'four', 'adults', 'four', 'distinct', 'stages', 'career', 'success', 'Invest', 'emotional', 'time', 'compare', 'where', 'are', 'life', 'comics', 'found', 'relating', 'differently', 'various', 'points', 'was', 'hooked', 'episode', 'one', 'when', 'Jay', 'Bobby', 'definitely', 'not', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'struck', 'back', 'other', 'merits', 'porn.Their', 'comedy', 'pieces', 'are', 'alright', 'not', 'funniest', 'comedy', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'presented', 'here', ""'re"", 'watching', 'train', 'wreck', 'more', 'accurately', 'are', 'watching', 'episode', 'Project', 'Greenlight', 'where', 'everything', 'wrong', 'Watching', 'grow', 'adjust', 'course', 'episodes', 'enthralled', 'me.And', 'last', 'episodes', 'featuring', 'Dane', 'others', 'were', 'famous', 'absolutely', 'priceless', 'very', 'moving', 'things', 'seem', 'drool-worthy', 'Cook', 'fans', 'watching', 'footage', 'Dane', 'when', 'was', 'teen', 'returning', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'later', 're-reading', 'letter', 'wrote', 'years', 'ago', 'again', 'wonder', 'why', 'bad', 'reviews', 'Anyone', 'who', 'human', 'drama', 'sociology', 'psychology', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'had', 'dream', 'make', 'big', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",Dane Cook's Tourgasm

1021677,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000ION25I,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","I wanted to complete the review of HBO's ""Tourgasm"" at the same time as I took a look at Dane Cook's concert film ""Vicious Circle."" I think Dane Cook is a talented and engaging performer, and I think his standup is genial and enjoyable. I can't say that I'm a big fan of his film choices thus far, but his CD's and concerts are genuinely funny and identifiable. In my review of ""Vicious Circle"", I gave the DVD 4 stars.Now that you know I don't have an agenda against Dane Cook, you can take this review in the spirit it was intended or not. ""Tourgasm"" is a reality show broadcast in 9 episodes. It takes a look at Dane with three other comics as they traveled the country to perform for 20 shows in 30 days. On paper, this seems like a great idea--some great comedy, some backstage drama, some insight into the comedy process, a more personal look at Dane Cook. There was a potential for many things.Inexplicably, however, nothing was delivered. The show has no narrative drive, no hook and nothing to invest yourself in. You want to hear great comedy? Not here. You get a couple of jokes from each show--but anyone familiar with Dane Cook's CDs and Gary Gulman's stint on ""Last Comic Standing"" will be familiar with the material. But trust me, this series is NOT about the comedy performances. Backstage drama, then? Absolutely not. We're treated to a couple of pranks, and an argument or two (mostly Robert Kelly picking on newbie Jay Davis). Not that interesting. Everyone keeps telling the camera how difficult this trip is, how revolutionary--and yet our view is so sanitized--if there was drama, I never saw it. At one point Gary Gulman actually leaves the tour for a while, I guess he's sick of it. But we see nothing leading up to it and the actual event takes place off camera. One day he's just not there. This is NOT backstage insight. Will you learn about the comedy process? Well, Jay Davis does make up one unfunny joke and we're treated to seeing him do it several times. Personal info on Dane? Nope.I feel strongly that this could have been fascinating TV. But as it stands, it is so uneventful as to be nonexistent. I'm only trying to warn you! These nine episodes will seem like a lifetime.

1021678,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000ION25I,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[13, 17]","A good premise gets wasted with Dane Cook's Tourgasm, which promises to give a first person back stage view of the cross country comedy tour piloted by Dane Cook, Gary Gulman, Robert Kelly, and Jay Davis.  Cook has since become huge in the comedy world, and is even branching out into movies, while Gulman will be familiar with those who frequently watch stand up specials on Comedy Central.  Robert Kelly isn't very funny, and Jay Davis a newbie comedian who frequently gets made fun of by Kelly.  There's a few interesting and funny moments here, including Davis bombing frequently and given advice from Cook, but these moments are few and very far between.  Not to mention that for a series dealing with comedians, you'd expect maybe a few more snippets of the shows they play, and you get a few, but not as many as you might like.  Not to mention there is a point in the show where Gulman departs, and no background information as to why is ever really given.  Even if you are a die hard fan of Dane Cook, you'll have a hard time enjoying Tourgasm, especially if you're looking for frequently funny moments.
