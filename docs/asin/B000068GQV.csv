My child started watching these fantastic videos at 8 months old, so we could teach her sign language. She is not hearing impaired but we thought it beneficial to teach her sign language as a second language to help her communictae with us before she could talk. She loved the videos and even asked to watch them. She did her first sign at 10 months and asked for 'Milk"". Now she is 2 years old an still mesmerized by the videos adn loves watching them. She now knows all the signs from the first three videos and signs them often. She is also talking a lot now and signing has in no way impaired her speech or slowed it down.These videos are pleaseing to the eye both for children adn grown ups. Many children sign the signs adn it is also repeeated verbally to help your hearing child to pick up the words. they are bright colourful adn the songs are beautiful adn very catchy.I would recommend these videos to anyone interested in teaching sign to their children.",5,Awesome video,1103846400,"12 24, 2004",2004,997,"['Check', 'out', 'more', 'info', 'child', 'started', 'watching', 'fantastic', 'videos', '8', 'months', 'old', 'could', 'teach', 'sign', 'language', 'not', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'thought', 'beneficial', 'teach', 'sign', 'language', 'second', 'language', 'help', 'communictae', 'could', 'talk', 'loved', 'videos', 'even', 'asked', 'watch', 'did', 'first', 'sign', '10', 'months', 'asked', ""'Milk"", 'Now', '2', 'years', 'old', 'still', 'mesmerized', 'videos', 'adn', 'loves', 'watching', 'now', 'signs', 'first', 'three', 'videos', 'signs', 'often', 'also', 'talking', 'lot', 'now', 'signing', 'way', 'impaired', 'speech', 'slowed', 'down.These', 'videos', 'are', 'pleaseing', 'eye', 'children', 'adn', 'grown', 'ups', 'Many', 'children', 'sign', 'signs', 'also', 'repeeated', 'verbally', 'help', 'hearing', 'child', 'pick', 'up', 'words', 'are', 'bright', 'colourful', 'songs', 'are', 'beautiful', 'adn', 'very', 'catchy.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'videos', 'anyone', 'interested', 'teaching', 'sign', 'children']",N/A

Then you see the item on the screen in a natural setting or as a cartoon. Then you see a mother doing the signing. After that you see kids doing the sign language as you see a wide variety of examples of that item. Big balls, little balls, orange balls and green balls. Then you see more kids doing the sign for the item. And at the end of the segment, the mother doing the sign for ball again.WE were quickly able to pick up several of the signs and begin using them in our daily speaking. With a little bit watching every day, we picked up many signs that were easy to use and encorporate daily.The negative:Very few negatives. One negative was that there was no sign taught for please and thank you. These are easy signs and should have been included in the first video I believe. The other negative for us, and my kids are a bit older and wanted to learn how to put some of those signs together. For example, it taught mother and it taught dog. They would have liked to see someone do mother dog. However, this is a starting video and I can understand why it didn't do that- it was just a negative for my children.Overall, a great video.

We knew we wanted to teach ASL as a 2nd language because of the many benefits such as earlier communication. You can communicate with your baby as young as 8 months old, maybe even younger. What a gift to know what your child needs before they can tell you with spoken words! For more information on the benefits of ASL check out the Signing Time website at [...]We love this volume of Signing Time. The songs are wonderful and work very well in a school setting as well as at home.  The songs are very catchy so you will find they get stuck in your head. Alex and Leah do a great job. We love to see the 2 friends/cousins interacting together.We like that the written word comes on the screen first and then they show the sign. It is very helpful for practicing the signs. It is like a video flashcard. It also helps children develop reading skills because they start to recognize the written word that goes with the sign. We love watching the children do the signs because you see lots of different kids and lots of different skill levels. It gives you an idea of how your child might make the sign at different ages. Rachel also does the sign so you can clearly see the proper way to do it.The song during the credits is a great way to learn additional signs that were not covered in the show. You can really add to your signing vocabulary if you pay attention.I highly recommend this volume of signing time as well as the other 5 in the series. As a mother and a teacher I can say it is truly the best educational tool I have found for teaching ASL to children (and adults too).

704541,A24BUT5LD6FNQ6,B000068GQV,Matthew Wall,"[117, 198]","This is a well-produced video that is a moderately entertaining introducton to ASL for kids, but which is disappointingly thin on content and not of a great deal of use for learning sign for either kids or parents wishing to teach their babies some sign.Signing is introduced one word at a time, with only a dozen or so words making it into the brief 30 minutes. Those signs that are shown are covered well, with multiple toddlers, the adult guide, and sometimes cartoon characters making the signs, all to a mixture of backdrops of live-action and animation. For instance, 'cat' shows a cartoon cat, real cats, and the adult and several kids making the sign interspersed.But there's just not enough material here to be useful. The video neither explains in depth how to go about learning to sign, nor does it address specific audiences -- for instance, baby-sign learners (all the kids using signs are older), those seeking to learn full ASL as a second language, or parents.As such, it has some entertainment value, but is not that useful. I hate  to give a nicely-done video a low rating, but there's no real educational design here or way to make it fit into learning sign except as supplemental material -- and even then, it's just not got a lot of depth.The DVD has basic chapter features, but the ""extras"" are misleading. The ""song"" the packaging promised, for instance, is just over the closing credits, not an extra sing-along while signing -- and it's far too sophisticated for beginners.For baby-sign learners, I'd recommend instead the Joseph Garcia book and video as an introduction -- and a decent basic reference -- the video is only in VHS but has about five times as many words as this DVD, and the accompanying book has decent illustrations, all for a price comparable to this DVD. For learning ASL, any kid old enough to read or adult can use one of the ASL-as-second-language textbooks designed to teach it as a natural language.",2,"Well-Produced, but Very Thin on Depth of Content",1113523200,"04 15, 2005",2005,1949,"['well-produced', 'video', 'moderately', 'entertaining', 'introducton', 'ASL', 'kids', 'disappointingly', 'thin', 'content', 'not', 'great', 'deal', 'use', 'learning', 'sign', 'kids', 'parents', 'wishing', 'teach', 'babies', 'sign.Signing', 'introduced', 'one', 'word', 'time', 'only', 'dozen', 'so', 'words', 'making', 'brief', '30', 'minutes', 'signs', 'are', 'shown', 'are', 'covered', 'well', 'multiple', 'toddlers', 'adult', 'guide', 'sometimes', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'making', 'signs', 'mixture', 'backdrops', 'live-action', 'animation', 'instance', 'cartoon', 'cat', 'real', 'cats', 'adult', 'several', 'kids', 'making', 'sign', 'interspersed.But', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'material', 'here', 'be', 'useful', 'video', 'explains', 'depth', 'how', 'go', 'about', 'learning', 'sign', 'address', 'specific', 'audiences', 'instance', 'baby-sign', 'learners', 'kids', 'using', 'signs', 'are', 'older', 'seeking', 'learn', 'full', 'ASL', 'second', 'language', 'parents.As', 'such', 'entertainment', 'value', 'not', 'useful', 'hate', 'give', 'nicely-done', 'video', 'low', 'rating', 'real', 'educational', 'design', 'here', 'way', 'make', 'fit', 'learning', 'sign', 'supplemental', 'material', 'even', 'then', 'just', 'not', 'got', 'lot', 'depth.The', 'DVD', 'basic', 'chapter', 'features', 'extras', 'are', 'misleading', 'song', 'packaging', 'promised', 'instance', 'just', 'closing', 'credits', 'not', 'extra', 'sing-along', 'signing', 'far', 'too', 'sophisticated', 'beginners.For', 'baby-sign', 'learners', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'instead', 'Joseph', 'Garcia', 'book', 'video', 'introduction', 'decent', 'basic', 'reference', 'video', 'only', 'VHS', 'about', 'five', 'times', 'many', 'words', 'DVD', 'accompanying', 'book', 'decent', 'illustrations', 'price', 'comparable', 'DVD', 'learning', 'ASL', 'kid', 'old', 'enough', 'read', 'adult', 'can', 'use', 'one', 'ASL-as-second-language', 'textbooks', 'designed', 'teach', 'natural', 'language']",N/A
