Not sure why they got cheap, then DVD 8 was good again like the rest.I'm not sure if they will release the complete series on DVD, so this aint bad for a substitute. They do have Season 1 on DVD and this box set starts with Season 2 which is great! Get this box set and season 1 and you're ready to go! Great down home southern cop show with Archie Bunkner and Bubba! What can be better!Amazing though they left out ""a matter of justice"" that starred the late great George C Scott! Also left out was ""walkout"" where O J Simpson had the guest role. Plus O'Conners fav episode of all time, one in which he wrote himself called ""Execution of Trust"". The people that just slapped together various episodes for this box was set was CLUELESS! But what else is new!",4,Great DVD set...but many GREAT episodes left out,1359676800,"02 1, 2013",2013,1001,"['DVD', '7', 'season', '6', 'mono-VCR', 'copy', 'disc', 'rest', 'are', 'very', 'high', 'quality', 'stereo', 'DVD', 'crisp', 'clean', 'pic', 'audio', 'when', 'got', 'DVD', '7', 'looked', 'VCR', 'tape', 'quality', 'theme', 'song', 'whole', 'episodes', 'were', 'mono', 'Not', 'sure', 'why', 'got', 'cheap', 'then', 'DVD', '8', 'was', 'good', 'again', 'rest.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'will', 'release', 'complete', 'series', 'DVD', 'aint', 'bad', 'substitute', 'do', 'have', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'starts', 'Season', '2', 'great', 'Get', 'box', 'set', 'season', '1', ""'re"", 'ready', 'go', 'Great', 'down', 'home', 'southern', 'cop', 'show', 'Archie', 'Bunkner', 'Bubba', 'What', 'can', 'be', 'better', 'Amazing', 'left', 'out', 'matter', 'justice', 'starred', 'late', 'great', 'George', 'C', 'Scott', 'Also', 'left', 'out', 'was', 'walkout', 'where', 'O', 'J', 'Simpson', 'had', 'guest', 'role', ""O'Conners"", 'fav', 'episode', 'time', 'one', 'wrote', 'called', 'Execution', 'Trust', 'people', 'just', 'slapped', 'together', 'various', 'episodes', 'box', 'was', 'set', 'was', 'CLUELESS', 'what', 'else', 'new']",N/A

I first started with the Best of Leave/Beaver then all the Seasons, leading me to Lassie/Jeff's Collie, Law & Order with only the Seasons Jerry Orbach (Lenny Brisco, so far Seasons 3-8) was in, all The Waltons Seasons & now In The Heat of the Night.  I've watched 4 of the episodes in this 24 hour/episode DVD & I can now see myself purchasing two Seasons a month until I have them all but I don't believe all the Seasons are on DVD yet.  Next will be All In The Family where as Carroll was superb!  And even though I've watched all these episodes dozens & dozens of time, I am still drawn to sit down & watch them again & again!  My way of collecting these masterpieces has brought back happier times in my life, like remembering my Mom & Dad as we sat & watched these shows together in the living room as a family & gives me classic entertainment, when in my opinion, to date lacks on television.
