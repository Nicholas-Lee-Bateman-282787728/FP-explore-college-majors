Scratch that. I still haven't.The deeper the plot got, the more confused I became. I'm not a simplton, either. I honestly don't know why half the people that died, died.It's also harder to give a movie more than three stars on a review when a key line in the movie is, ""If I'm lyin', I'm dyin'."" Why not just make it, ""What's up doc?"" or even ""That's what she said."" Those are sadly more amusing.The random sex scene was also annoying. ""I just got the fool beat out of me ... again. Wanna mess around?"" It didn't flow. The only thing more enjoyable than counting the times Jericho (Prinze) got the fool beat out of him were the very very few twists in the plot.Don't buy this movie.

I don't want to give away too much of the plot.When's the last time we saw Freddie Prinze Jr?  This movie is worth the price of seeing Ving Rhames suck on chicken feet.  By the end of the movie you're confused as to just who is going to come out on top.

942529,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000BI5LFK,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[3, 5]","After watching this I came to the conclusion that I was watching a rip-off ""Poolhall Junkies"" and a poorly executed one too. Freddi Prinze Jr. as your main character comes off and nothing more then a pretty face who thinks he can shoot some pool. In the final stages of the film, I wanted to cut my ears off because I couldn't stand his ""broken nose"" accent.Ving Rhames was waaay below par in this film; all he does is walk around and chew on alligator feet which was quite nasty to me. He actually does nothing in the film, until the climax when he shoots some pool and a gun. Roselyn Sanchez played her role quite well, albeit her history in the story does not need to be actually in there, and finally Callum Keith Rennie does a good performance, but his character was written in what seems to be a hurried way. The whole crew was (if you can imagine the analogy) put into a blender, served up with whipped cream and a cherry on top, when you are expecting something bitter. It didn't blend at all well, the acting between the people.The visuals within the film are great. The director did a great job for showing such a different forray of shots; the sleazy underworld, the wonderful city shots and the added bonus of Pool-Hall terms being printed and written across angled camera-shots - I liked. Freddie actually shoots some pool here, nice to see that, but it's obvious that the trick shots are done by someone else. I liked the whole switching of the shooting sides that Freddie does near the end though; I thought that was a nice addition.This film, in it's own right, is a film that went straight-to-DVD/video and quite rightly so. No way would it have performed in the cinemas with the rest of the blockbusters of 2005. I can say that `Shooting Gallery' is one of those films that people rent when they have run out of films to watch.",3,"""If I'm Lyin...I'm Dyin.""",1159660800,"10 1, 2006",2006,1845,"['watching', 'came', 'conclusion', 'was', 'watching', 'rip-off', 'Poolhall', 'Junkies', 'poorly', 'executed', 'one', 'too', 'Freddi', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'main', 'character', 'off', 'nothing', 'more', 'then', 'pretty', 'face', 'who', 'can', 'shoot', 'pool', 'final', 'stages', 'film', 'wanted', 'cut', 'ears', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'broken', 'nose', 'accent.Ving', 'Rhames', 'was', 'waaay', 'par', 'film', 'walk', 'chew', 'alligator', 'feet', 'was', 'quite', 'nasty', 'actually', 'nothing', 'film', 'climax', 'when', 'shoots', 'pool', 'gun', 'Roselyn', 'Sanchez', 'played', 'role', 'quite', 'well', 'history', 'story', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'actually', 'there', 'finally', 'Callum', 'Keith', 'Rennie', 'good', 'performance', 'character', 'was', 'written', 'what', 'be', 'hurried', 'way', 'whole', 'crew', 'was', 'can', 'imagine', 'analogy', 'put', 'blender', 'served', 'up', 'whipped', 'cream', 'cherry', 'top', 'when', 'are', 'expecting', 'something', 'bitter', 'did', ""n't"", 'blend', 'well', 'acting', 'people.The', 'visuals', 'film', 'are', 'great', 'director', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'showing', 'such', 'different', 'forray', 'shots', 'sleazy', 'underworld', 'wonderful', 'city', 'shots', 'added', 'bonus', 'Pool-Hall', 'terms', 'being', 'printed', 'written', 'angled', 'camera-shots', 'liked', 'Freddie', 'actually', 'pool', 'here', 'nice', 'see', 'obvious', 'trick', 'shots', 'are', 'done', 'someone', 'else', 'liked', 'whole', 'switching', 'shooting', 'sides', 'Freddie', 'end', 'thought', 'was', 'nice', 'addition.This', 'film', 'own', 'right', 'film', 'went', 'straight-to-DVD/video', 'quite', 'rightly', 'so', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'performed', 'cinemas', 'rest', 'blockbusters', '2005', 'can', 'say', 'Shooting', 'Gallery', 'one', 'films', 'people', 'rent', 'when', 'have', 'run', 'films', 'watch']",Shooting Gallery

This is all very common but what is uncommon is the quality of photography and back ground music. Cinematography is superlative - all frames are complete - lighting is fabulous - can compare it to Sincity. Now a days in the world of computer generated movies it is difficult to find such photography.  You will notice that the editing is also great and matches with the phography - some the trick shots in the pool table are great. Good entertaining movie.

942532,A1VKCMOWYX2OEB,B000BI5LFK,R. Gale,"[3, 5]","A terrible film on every level.  The story is unbelievable as well as unrealistic.  The characters are not only hard to believe, but are not sympathetic so you really don't care.  There is so much slang inserted into the dialogue that's it almost incomprehensible -- they actually have a special feature on poolhall slang which I guess we're supposed to watch first.  Seeing a few well done pool shots well executed is the only positive thing I can say about this mess, but that it's not enough to warrant even a rental, as you can see that on ESPN.

The bright spots of the movie are Ving Rhames, your always going to get a good performance from , he played his part well and Roselyn Sanchez, I have not seen her in any movie previous to this one , Not only is she beatiful but she can actually act this is usually uncommon with beatiful actresses. Really those where the only two reasons I bought this movie cause I am a Ving Rhames fan and I wanted to see Roselyn Sanchez.
