1073164,A1YCV76MUFESR1,B000Q5L9N6,Anne-Marie G,"[0, 0]","Really loved watching this movie. I was surprised at how well done it actually was, with the description I had actually avoided watching it for a while. Kim Ah Joong plays Hana, an ""ugly, overweight"" woman who is only valued for her voice. She does not only phone sex calls but also is the voice for a beautiful, thin pop star.  She is pretty content with that life until she accidentally overhears the pop star and the producer (who Hana has a crush on) talking about her and how she is only a voice.Utterly devastated by hearing the man she loves say that she tries to kill herself--and then gets another idea.One of her phone sex clients is a plastic surgeon. She blackmails him into helping her and she becomes the beautiful Jenny.Kim Ah Joong does such an amazing job of playing Jenny as someone who is completely uncomfortable in her new body.  That discomfort is more than a physical problem and is what drives the rest of the movie. Hana has to struggle with figuring out who she is now that she looks completely different and has taken up a new identity (yet has gone back to her old job).The male main character is a great catalyst for all of the changes that Hana/Jenny undergo. He is also a sort of shades of gray character who also has some growing to do, but as a secondary character we don't see it as much.Totally worth watching, it is funny and heartwarming.Also, it has a fantastic cover of Blondie's Ave Maria as Jenny's anthem song. Kim Ah Joong does a great job with it.",5,Loved it!

Chen ""what is in a nickname""","[7, 7]","Warning: This DVD disc is not region 1, so you'll probably need either a player that can read all regions (ex. blu-ray) or use your computer to watch.  You can also see this movie for free now online at a lot of places, but if you like it you'll probably want to own it. I'd buy it here because foreign import DVDs usually cost a lot more for shipping and handling.This is one of my favorite movies of all time! The premise is simple and borrowed, but comes off fresh because it takes a couple old stories and puts a new angle on it.  It's like a prince and pauper story with a popstar instead of prince.  It's like a cinderella story with evil corporation instead of evil family.  It's like an ugly duckling tale with plastic surgery instead of a swan.  The whole mix is set to some funky Kpop music and adds some touching realistic drama.Hanna is a 200lb woman with a gorgeous heart and beautiful voice. Unfortunately, no one seems to appreciate this. So, she transforms herself in a desperate act and goes through head to toe surgery.  This changes her life, but in ways totally unexpected.  Suddenly, she realizes that maybe she just didn't value what was inside because of what others told her about her outside.

Kim as Hanna has a life full of heartbreak: she is grossly overweight, bucktoothed, has a father with Alzheimers, and secretly in love with her producer, the only man who is even remotely kind to her. Matters become so bad that Hanna considers suicide but wisely changes her mind. Instead she blackmails a plastic surgeon into performing a head to foot plastic surgery so that she emerges as Jenny, a drop-dead gorgeous model type who sings as well as did Hanna. This film is a sentimental throwback to much earlier ones that celebrate victory over personal trauma. Hanna/Jenny at first is thrilled with being eye candy that is until she learns that inner beauty is as least as important as the outer variety. Further her producer rather preferred the Hanna version. Jenny clearly loves him even as he struggles to learn the same lessons as she does. The climax at the end when she acknowledges her confused father is truly tearful. Ah-Jung Kim performs her own songs and her rendition of &#34;Maria Ave Maria&#34; is breathtaking. 200 POUNDS BEAUTY does not pretend to suggest that it is more than what it is but it does show that for Hanna/Jenny inner peace is often more likely to be achieved if only we could peer inward to see who and what we are.",4,Heartwarming,1397779200,"04 18, 2014",2014,1367,"['200', 'POUNDS', 'BEAUTY', 'Ah-Jung', 'Kim', 'obese', '34', 'hidden', '34', 'singer', 'beautiful', 'untalented', 'singer', 'Kim', 'Hanna', 'life', 'full', 'heartbreak', 'grossly', 'overweight', 'bucktoothed', 'father', 'Alzheimers', 'secretly', 'love', 'producer', 'only', 'man', 'who', 'even', 'remotely', 'kind', 'Matters', 'become', 'so', 'bad', 'Hanna', 'considers', 'suicide', 'wisely', 'mind', 'Instead', 'plastic', 'surgeon', 'performing', 'head', 'foot', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'Jenny', 'drop-dead', 'gorgeous', 'model', 'type', 'who', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'Hanna', 'film', 'sentimental', 'throwback', 'much', 'earlier', 'ones', 'celebrate', 'victory', 'personal', 'trauma', 'Hanna/Jenny', 'first', 'thrilled', 'being', 'eye', 'candy', 'inner', 'beauty', 'as', 'least', 'as', 'important', 'outer', 'variety', 'Further', 'producer', 'rather', 'preferred', 'Hanna', 'version', 'Jenny', 'clearly', 'even', 'learn', 'same', 'lessons', 'climax', 'end', 'when', 'confused', 'father', 'truly', 'tearful', 'Ah-Jung', 'Kim', 'own', 'songs', 'rendition', '34', 'Maria', 'Ave', 'Maria', '34', 'breathtaking', '200', 'POUNDS', 'BEAUTY', 'not', 'pretend', 'suggest', 'more', 'what', 'show', 'Hanna/Jenny', 'inner', 'peace', 'often', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'achieved', 'only', 'could', 'peer', 'inward', 'see', 'who', 'what', 'are']",200 Pounds Beauty (Standard Edition) DVD

1073175,A2PDVQRK9PSIPJ,B000Q5L9N6,Tamarleigh Lippegrenfell,"[4, 10]","Spoiler Alert: This review contains detailed descriptions of the plot.This movie is NOT FUNNY. I would have given up on it after the first 30 minutes, but I was already planning this review, so I stuck it out in order to write an informed review. The movie seemed interminable.The woman, Hannah, is a singer, and she has a large body. She sings for a petite woman, Ammy, who is pretty but untalented and lip-synchs on stage while Hannah does the real singing backstage. The male lead is the music producer, on whom Hannah has a big crush. Unfortunately, one day Hannah finds out that he is just using her. Despondent, she tries to commit suicide.She ends up getting interrupted by a phone call from one of her phone sex clients who happens to be a plastic surgeon. She tapes him, blackmails him, and gets him to perform dangerous plastic surgery on her to make her look thin and pretty.Inexplicably, Hannah is STILL in love with the guy even though she had found out what a jerk he is.Hannah is also a jerk. She is supposedly a nice person, but she is a total jerk to her sweet little dog, which really says more about her character than anything else. Later in the film, she's a complete jerk to her own father, who is elderly and senile and perfectly nice.Hannah's best friend is also a shallow jerk. She is truly cruel in her comments to Hannah. I truly can't understand why Hannah is even friends with her in the first place.Ammy is a shallow, selfish jerk as well. She's a snotty, snobby, jealous, vindictive person. The plastic surgeon is a shallow, selfish jerk. Hannah's spiritual mentor (or whatever, from the first scene) is also a jerk. The guy's brother is sort of ok, but not really, and the guys' father is probably the biggest jerk of all. Really, the only two characters who are nice are Hannah's father and Hannah's dog, both of whom she treats like dirt, as I already mentioned.There isn't a single main character who is not a jerk, nor is there any actually funny dialogue. Seriously, everyone in the movie is a jerk, and the whole movie just sort of revolves around the jerky idea that people with large bodies are ugly and worthless, even though it seemed to me from the description that it was going to be something of the opposite. The ""funny"" parts are things like Hannah being so big that she falls through the floor of the stage, Hannah being so big that when she tries to bow to the mentor guy, her butt hits the wall behind her and launches her forward to fall and make a mess, and Hannah's father being so senile that when he dances with Hannah, he thinks he's dancing with Hannah's (presumably deceased) mother, and gropes Hannah's butt. If that's the kind of thing you find funny, you'll probably love the film. Otherwise, don't bother.I hated it ""from head to toe...everything.""",1,"LAME, shallow, NOT funny whatsoever.",1369008000,"05 20, 2013",2013,2810,"['Spoiler', 'Alert', 'review', 'detailed', 'descriptions', 'plot.This', 'movie', 'NOT', 'FUNNY', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'was', 'already', 'planning', 'review', 'stuck', 'out', 'order', 'write', 'informed', 'review', 'movie', 'seemed', 'interminable.The', 'woman', 'Hannah', 'singer', 'large', 'body', 'petite', 'woman', 'Ammy', 'who', 'pretty', 'untalented', 'lip-synchs', 'stage', 'Hannah', 'real', 'singing', 'backstage', 'male', 'lead', 'music', 'producer', 'whom', 'Hannah', 'big', 'crush', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'day', 'Hannah', 'out', 'just', 'using', 'Despondent', 'commit', 'suicide.She', 'up', 'getting', 'interrupted', 'phone', 'call', 'one', 'phone', 'sex', 'clients', 'who', 'be', 'plastic', 'surgeon', 'perform', 'dangerous', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'make', 'look', 'thin', 'pretty.Inexplicably', 'Hannah', 'STILL', 'love', 'guy', 'even', 'had', 'found', 'out', 'what', 'jerk', 'also', 'jerk', 'supposedly', 'nice', 'person', 'total', 'jerk', 'sweet', 'little', 'dog', 'really', 'more', 'character', 'anything', 'else', 'Later', 'film', 'complete', 'jerk', 'own', 'father', 'who', 'elderly', 'senile', 'perfectly', 'best', 'friend', 'also', 'shallow', 'jerk', 'truly', 'cruel', 'comments', 'Hannah', 'truly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Hannah', 'even', 'friends', 'first', 'place.Ammy', 'shallow', 'selfish', 'jerk', 'as', 'well', 'snotty', 'snobby', 'jealous', 'vindictive', 'person', 'plastic', 'surgeon', 'shallow', 'selfish', 'jerk', 'Hannah', 'spiritual', 'mentor', 'whatever', 'first', 'scene', 'also', 'jerk', 'guy', 'brother', 'sort', 'ok', 'not', 'really', 'guys', 'father', 'probably', 'biggest', 'jerk', 'Really', 'only', 'two', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'nice', 'are', 'Hannah', 'father', 'Hannah', 'dog', 'whom', 'dirt', 'already', 'mentioned.There', ""n't"", 'single', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'not', 'jerk', 'there', 'actually', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'Seriously', 'everyone', 'movie', 'jerk', 'whole', 'movie', 'just', 'sort', 'revolves', 'jerky', 'idea', 'people', 'large', 'bodies', 'are', 'ugly', 'worthless', 'even', 'seemed', 'description', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'something', 'opposite', 'funny', 'parts', 'are', 'things', 'Hannah', 'being', 'so', 'big', 'floor', 'stage', 'Hannah', 'being', 'so', 'big', 'when', 'bow', 'mentor', 'guy', 'butt', 'wall', 'forward', 'fall', 'make', 'mess', 'Hannah', 'father', 'being', 'so', 'senile', 'when', 'Hannah', 'dancing', 'Hannah', 'presumably', 'deceased', 'mother', 'Hannah', 'butt', 'kind', 'thing', 'find', 'funny', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'love', 'film', 'Otherwise', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother.I', 'hated', 'head', 'toe', 'everything']",200 Pounds Beauty (Standard Edition) DVD
