The one Jimi DVD where he plays at his best is ""Live at the Filmore East"" but the video quality is low.

On this disk, it shows an amateur video of the concert taken by a guy who sneaked on stage during it. If you are a fan of Hendrix, you should already own this concert and not be reading a review.

What a disappointment.At first I blamed the camera operators for zooming in for close-ups when they could have shown Hendrix's fingerwork on solos. After all, ""idiot camera syndrome"" was pretty prevalent during the 60s.However, a viewing of the original Woodstock motion picture reveals that there were other camera angles available. For instance, during ""Voodoo Child (A Slight Return)"" the movie shows full-frontal guitar action where the newer ""complete"" release opts for close-up nostril shots. It's the equivalent of focusing on a quarterback's helmet while he's running a full-field touchdown. Jeez.The original film was also released in widescreen format, while the newer version is in ""pan and scan."" This would've been OK if the editors had just panned and scanned. There were many shots where Hendrix was standing to the far left of the frame, fully visible in widescreen but barely visible in the new aspect ratio.In my opinion, the makers of this DVD have squandered a golden opportunity to present a historic performance in its entirety.It's a damn shame.",2,Greatness Ruined by Poor Editing,1233187200,"01 29, 2009",2009,1162,"['was', 'quite', 'excited', 'prospect', 'seeing', 'complete', 'footage', 'Hendrix', 'Woodstock', 'What', 'disappointment.At', 'first', 'blamed', 'camera', 'operators', 'zooming', 'close-ups', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'shown', 'Hendrix', 'fingerwork', 'solos', 'idiot', 'camera', 'syndrome', 'was', 'pretty', 'prevalent', '60s.However', 'viewing', 'original', 'Woodstock', 'motion', 'picture', 'were', 'other', 'camera', 'angles', 'available', 'instance', 'Voodoo', 'Child', 'A', 'Slight', 'Return', 'movie', 'full-frontal', 'guitar', 'action', 'where', 'newer', 'complete', 'release', 'opts', 'close-up', 'nostril', 'shots', 'equivalent', 'focusing', 'quarterback', 'helmet', 'running', 'full-field', 'touchdown', 'Jeez.The', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'released', 'widescreen', 'format', 'newer', 'version', 'pan', 'scan', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'OK', 'editors', 'had', 'just', 'panned', 'scanned', 'were', 'many', 'shots', 'where', 'Hendrix', 'was', 'standing', 'far', 'left', 'frame', 'fully', 'visible', 'widescreen', 'barely', 'visible', 'new', 'aspect', 'ratio.In', 'opinion', 'makers', 'DVD', 'have', 'squandered', 'golden', 'opportunity', 'present', 'historic', 'performance', 'entirety.It', 'damn', 'shame']",N/A

The interviews and bonus materials round out the package nicely and put the event in perspective.

I had to retract that statement.Now the Hendrix family has released the full performance, or at least everything that exists on film on his performance at that landmark Woodstock festival.There are 2 DVDs, one with the complete filmed version, that the promoters were able to get on such short notice. This is the completion of what we already had.The second DVD is an actual taped real time video that someone had taken with a camera and kept for 35 years until the family got him to release it with this set. Now everything Hendrix did that was recorded is available.The quality of the first (filmed) DVD is fine, that of the second is spotty (it was mostly in black and white) supplemented with clips from the filmed version where the video had dropouts. The video version has the only clip of ""Hear my Train Coming"" - the film guys were reloading at that time.This is of great historical value, and all Hendrix fans will want to own it, simply because it has the whole thing.Of course I never get tired of watching Hendrix play his music.

The result is that the 1999 version has less compression and more dynamic range and headroom.  It does make a big difference when you play them side by side!

928438,A3LKGCBWNFVEJ6,B000AM6N9U,"Ivan Brantes Salinas ""Ivan Brantes""","[12, 13]","This is a must have / highly recommended DVD; it really needs an extra star.  For the very first time you can see Jimi Hendrix's then new band ""Gipsy Sun and Rainbows"" (Band of Gypsies for short)ALMOST complete live performance at Woodstock Music and Arts Fair Festival (1969).DVD 1 is the almost complete performance except for Hear my Train a Coming. Master Mind and Gypsy Woman.  I can't believe that parts of this material were shelved during 36 years (Lover Man, Hey Joe..) without seeing the light of the day.Lots of close up to Jimi's, face, fingers, guitar, you can even learn how to play the songs (watch Red House for instance: plug your Stratocaster and start a blues lesson from the master himself).  Jimi sometimes is not very ""happy"" with this new band. He currently shows Larry Lee the notes/tone he should be playing on and gives instructions to Jerry ""high on the mountains"" Velez to stop smashing the congas.  Just watch the face of Jimi after playing ""Fire"" (Uh my god!).Even more, at one point Jimi tells the audience ""we are only jamming you can leave it if you want"".  There are some small portions edited such as Jimi countain the frets before starting  Izabella and Jimi answering ""I got mines"" when someone in the audience offer him to get ""high"" (just before ""Message to Love""); both used to appear on the previous DVD.DVD 2 is the almost complete performance as it happens, no interruptions and in the most pure shape.  The additional black and white footage is simply great (forget the technical problems) since it gives a new dimension of the performance and makes a great companion for the front images.  You can even see a woman offering dope to Jimi and how he rejects it.  It seems the takes from this camera were also used on ""Woodstock Lost Performances"" VHS/Laserdisc for Janis Joplin ""Work me Lord"" performance.If you look carefully you'll see another video camera shooting from the right side of the stage, just behind Jimi.  So maybe in the future we'll see a 3 DVD set containing new shots of the performance....Please note that Mitch Mitchell wrote on his book ""The Hendrix Experience"" (by Mitch Mitchell and John Platt - 1993 Mitchell Beazley) that the set list was: Message to love, Hear my Train a Coming, Spanish Castle Magic, Red House, MASTER MIND (vocals by Larry), Foxy Lady, Jam Back at the House, Izabella, GYPSY WOMAN (vocals by Larry), Fire, Voodoo Chile, Star Spangled Banner, Purple Haze, Villanova Junction, Hey Joe.  So there are two numbers missed (Master mind and Gypsy Woman) which is something known to Hendrix bootlegs recordings collectors.The candid interviews give knowledge of the festival since its beginning to the end (just listen to Chip Monk saying the last words of the event ""Thank you so very much"" as the remaining audience starts to leave the site).  Listen to Eddy Kramer impressions when he get to the festival site on Friday morning and listen to Mike Lang revealing for the very first time the former artist who was about to close the festival.  The so called press conference is very interesting despite the drop outs.Will ever be an ultimate video release with all THE MUSIC performed at Woodstock?

I was born in 1971, so Jimi had already died by the time I was born. Fortunately his music lives on for everyone and this may be the crown jewel of his career.When I first bought the DVD I couldn't believe I actually had this footage in my hands. I mean this was the legendary Woodstock Concert of 1969. This much footage of Jimi was not supposed to exist. Much like Indiana Jones, I felt as if I was holding the Arc or the Holy Grail for the first time.Before popping in the DVD I read the booklet that came with it. The story behind the filming of Hendrix is reading entertainment in itself. A deal to film the concert was landed just two days prior to the show. The crew had little time to prepare. Also if the crew had not decided to reload their cameras at the time they did, the 'Star Spangled Banner' would have been a moment in time lost. They got the film rolling again just in time.In the meantime, little did anyone know, that a college student snuck up on stage with a video camera. We smuggled his equipment on stage by walking behind a roadie carrying a guitar. As soon as he was set up everyone left him alone because he was thought to be part of the film crew. Disc 2 of this double DVD is his footage. The story goes the young man hitch-hiked out of Woodstock after the show only to be picked up by a truck driver who knew where Jimi was staying. The young student visited Jimi and showed him the footage. Jimi enjoyed it. This film has not been seen since. Stored away, locked away for almost 35 years.If you are a guitar player, this is a must see event. What Jimi could do with a guitar was no short of amazing. Eric Clapton and Pete Townsend were terrified of him, and rightly so. Jimi commanded the Woodstock stage and was in total control of the wall of sound he blasted out onto the muddy farmland. It was his show and everyone knew it. The setlist was awesome. My personal favorite is Voodoo Chile (Slight Return). He was the master of the wah pedal. Maybe this performance was not as spectacular as the Monterey Show, but Jimi didn't have anything to prove this time around.Hendrix fans like myself will find themselves pulling this off the shelf and popping it in the player often. Jimi may be gone, but what he left us will last forever.

Hendrix never sounded so good. I would even dare say that it might have edged out his groundbreaking, immortal performance at Monterey, which was well encapsulated for DVD by those responsible for the Criterion Collection set.There is no bland song present. Even when it appeared that the music would begin to mellow, Jimi would either start hitting the chords or suddenly pick up the quick series of string pluckings to show that no one during his day was his equal when it came to performing on stage with the amplifiers, reverb and all.I implore you to get this set if you want to listen to a master at work.

Finally, after more than 35 years, the bulk of the footage is now available in this Deluxe Edition. The packaging is superb, as are both DVDs included within. The first disc features the majority of Hendrix's set, save for the omission of 3 songs, plus a look back at Woodstock by Hendrix's band members and others. There are some spectacular camera angles - most notably, my favorite is the crane shot that zooms from the audience to the stage where Hendrix and his bandmates are performing. Also, guitarists will be pleased to see a number of excellent shots of Hendrix fingers as they practically glide across the fretboard. Color footage is very good to excellent throughout.The second DVD features another look at the concert, from the vantage point of an amateur cameraman who was lucky enough to be on stage to record the show. The quality of this footage ranges from spotty to excellent, but given the fact we have this recording, it's definitely an added treat. Furthermore, the cameraman captured a song that the professionals didn't, namely ""Hear My Train..."".Jimi delivered an excellent set - with old songs (Foxey Lady, Hey Joe, Purple Haze) and new (Izabella, Jam Back at the House, Message to Love) mixed in.

We get prolonged close-ups of Jimi's nostrils, the back of his head, his finger tips, and people sitting in the audience looking mostly miserable and bored.

One thing that struck me by watching him at Woodstock and listening was that what I thought were studio - were him! Just him!. The intro that tells how they nearly missed and scrambled not to miss and how somehow everything worked down to the last scrap of film; and the breakdown of the Why there are  the Band of Gypsies it is really important to know you have this product. Lots of people read all this and pieced it all together - but I was a Jimi fan and not too detailed in the who what's why and wherefore's. Felt intimidated by the younger set who knew so much on this. I just was a great fan of his music from Hey Joe forward - and Electric Ladyland was and is one of my favorite albums - he gave us cred. Those of us who were going through the era - he gave us this fantastic guitar and song selection - so respectful of both his roots in blues and the need for psychedelic rock. If you please. And his continued nod and tributes to his heroes - the greats and the legends. The man had class, style was human = best of all he was all about his music. There are different shots of the people in the field = mud, showing large crowd and some shots show less. There were a lot less than the previous night. There was actually space between people down front. People left for various reasons. The ones who stayed were there for Jimi. Captive audiences too by the earlier performance of Paul Butterfield. Any thought of leaving then was gone. It was more than worth hanging on - where would you go anyway, so hungry and burnt out and miss Jimi Hendrix?  Well- he didn't disappoint. He was a warm sight. There are things on this video that are amazing. Awesome. If you never saw him play or did and want to see him again.

Go dig out an old ancient VHS copy of the Woodstock movie and you'll see what I mean. This footage cleaned up nice. A lot of film was shot watching Jimi's fingers run the neck of his guitar. If your into guitars and guitar players alone you'll love this part. This is why there is (or was) no other.. While you're watching this DVD, take a look at all the background stuff going on. The literal crowd of people that's up on stage WITH Jimi while he's playing. That's never allowed now. Too many screwballs at concerts played today. What about the mostly empty field where the half million strong crowd once was. Those people left over (still in the thousands) were those that didnt have to get to work or back to school the next day. Remember that some idiot decided that Jimi should still play as the last act, and on Monday morning at 9am, not sunday at midnite as was originally planned. Everything was running late by Sunday. Too bad. The logistics nightmare that unfolded over three days is detailed real well at the start of the video. Disc two is sort of an edited down and put together floor clippings version of the first. It includes what looks like amature footage and perhaps some early day video tape attempts. I'm sure its in the credits as to who shot what. I didnt look. Whatever.. Fun to watch. If you always wished that you could have seen the whole Hendrix Woodstock performance, here it is pretty much..

They mostly show close-ups of Jimi's face, but that's because people rarely ever filmed live concerts back then.  It's definitely very raw, and the full extended band doesn't completely work for Hendrix.  However, this show includes a lot of information about the show, interview footage of what Hendrix was doing at the time, and the concert twice.I personally feel that although the black and white footage of the show on the second disc is of a lower film quality, it makes me feel like I'm there much more than the footage from the professional cameramen.

928457,A3JEV3M4L5R2OL,B000AM6N9U,T. S. C.,"[2, 2]","Oh to have been at this Hendrix performance, but alas I was just a nipper at the time! Oh well, such is life. We can always watch this utterly amazing performance whenever we were born thankfully.I have been a fan of Hendrix for years; I think that not only was he a great showman, but he was a masterful and superlative guitarist with an amazing technique, both as an excellent rhythm guitarist and as perhaps, almost certainly, the finest improvisational and lead guitarist ever. Whilst writing this I am listening to 'Drivin' South' which is an amazing sonic assault Blues of which Jimi was the undoubted master. So inventive and skillful in his improvisational ability.The Woodstock concert stands out of the era it was made in, yet Hendrix was very much a man of his time and Woodstock was the culmination of the pop and youth and hippie culture that was present at the time and was possibly in its end phase, certainly the naive idealism of hippie culture anyway.Hendrix's performance at Woodstock is utterly amazing and mind-blowing; most guitarists at their best are like Hendrix at his worst; and Hendrix at his best? Well, he could make you question everything! I find it hard to say that Hendrix's music is 'pop music' as it seems to transcend most of that which has the epithet of 'pop music' at the time. In the early 60's most popular music was throwaway stuff, not really saying anything, and not reaching out beyond a pleasant listen or two; by the end of the 60's popular music and popular culture was expanding and was talking about and trying to express deeper meanings and become more genuinely introspective and thoughtful; some of the better artists, writers, film-makers and musicians managed to become successful whilst at the same time trying to remain true to their muse; I think Hendrix was one of them.So, we come to Jimi; His performance at Woodstock for me can't be bettered, even though he makes a few mistakes (yes, one or two!) but his overall performance at Woodstock is a landmark in popular cultural history, for me it stands out as one of the defining moments of the twentieth century; but maybe that's just me. If you watch Hendrix here playing 'Voodoo Chile' it is perhaps one of the most exciting, energetic and mindblowing rock performances ever; he certainly gave value for money on that one! But for me, the highlights of this concert are the 'Woodstock Improvisation' and the track 'Villanova Junction.' Although Hendrix was often seen as the psychedelic freak-out wild eyed guitarist who could blow everybody away, I find that when he bared his soul, and just played, he could play more beautifully and thoughtfully than anyone else. The piece entitled 'Woodstock Improvisation' is a tour-de-force of all kinds of unorthodox and wonderful guitar playing that not only showed off Hendrix's playing ability but also his completely original creativity too; there are tender moments in this piece that defy description and are best simply just savoured and enjoyed. Likewise, when Hendrix plays 'Villanova Junction' he bares his soul and his vulnerability, and touches on things that can't be put into words and only into music, emotions we have no adequate words for; if you watch it you might understand what I am getting at; or perhaps not.So, this Hendrix performance for me is a defining moment in world history, and not just a guitarist at the top of his game.

Now for the first time, we can see Hendrix's entire Woodstock performance -- 14 songs delivered in their original sequence -- with the six-piece Gypsy Sun & Rainbows. Released in 1999, the original single-disc Jimi Hendrix: Live at Woodstock offered an hour's worth of highlights from the show, but not the whole enchilada.Yet there's more: The feature movie on disc 1 has been painstakingly re-edited with new camera angles, and expanded to 80 minutes with recent interviews. Those who worked closely with Hendrix -- bandmates Mitch Mitchell, Noel Redding, and Billy Cox; Gypsy Sun & Rainbows second guitarist Larry Lee and percussionist Juma Sultan; engineer Eddie Kramer; and assorted managers and promoters -- all have their say about his legacy.In a way, disc 2 is even more amazing. A 22-year-old college student managed to smuggle a clunky, tripod-mounted video camera onstage and shoot the whole show from the musician's perspective. In this footage, we watch Hendrix joking and giving directions to the band as if we were standing next to Cox and Lee, and we hear Hendrix's raps, most of which are missing from the film edition. Amazingly, this video also contains seven minutes of music -- a bluesy jam of ""Hear My Train a Comin'"" -- the official film crew missed.By today's standards, the black-and-white video images are primitive, but the intimacy of this footage makes it priceless. Where the videotape runs into technical trouble, the editors have substituted 16mm film clips -- always perfectly in sync with the music and often providing alternative angles to those in the main film. Essentially, we get two views of Hendrix's spellbinding performance: a full-color, carefully edited, multi-camera edition, shot primarily from the front of the stage, plus a grainy, black-and-white cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute; version shot from behind.Disc 2 also includes three mini-documentaries. In a press conference in Harlem, held shortly after Woodstock, we watch a mellow Hendrix respond to questions from the uptight press regarding politics, drugs, and society. Cox and Lee recall the times they spent playing in clubs with Hendrix in the Nashville area, and we see a handful of photos from this period. Finally, Kramer describes in detail how he dealt with the technical challenges of recording Hendrix at Woodstock. A cool booklet with Hendrix's handwritten set list and poetry, stage photos, and a detailed essay on how the film crew captured the event completes the package. The expanded Live at Woodstock makes it perfectly clear why, decades after his death, Hendrix remains rock's most inventive and magical guitarist.",5,Hendrix as we've never seen him,1131235200,"11 6, 2005",2005,2711,"['Hendrix', 'freaks', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'better', 'two-DVD', 'set', 'Now', 'first', 'time', 'can', 'see', 'Hendrix', 'entire', 'Woodstock', 'performance', '14', 'songs', 'delivered', 'original', 'sequence', 'six-piece', 'Gypsy', 'Sun', 'Rainbows', 'Released', '1999', 'original', 'single-disc', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'Live', 'Woodstock', 'offered', 'hour', 'worth', 'highlights', 'show', 'not', 'whole', 'enchilada.Yet', 'more', 'feature', 'movie', 'disc', '1', 'been', 'painstakingly', 're-edited', 'new', 'camera', 'angles', 'expanded', '80', 'minutes', 'recent', 'interviews', 'who', 'worked', 'closely', 'Hendrix', 'Mitch', 'Mitchell', 'Noel', 'Redding', 'Billy', 'Cox', 'Gypsy', 'Sun', 'Rainbows', 'second', 'guitarist', 'Larry', 'Lee', 'percussionist', 'Juma', 'Sultan', 'engineer', 'Eddie', 'Kramer', 'assorted', 'managers', 'promoters', 'have', 'say', 'legacy.In', 'way', 'disc', '2', 'even', 'more', 'amazing', '22-year-old', 'college', 'student', 'managed', 'smuggle', 'clunky', 'tripod-mounted', 'video', 'camera', 'onstage', 'shoot', 'whole', 'show', 'musician', 'perspective', 'footage', 'watch', 'Hendrix', 'joking', 'giving', 'directions', 'band', 'were', 'standing', 'next', 'Cox', 'Lee', 'hear', 'Hendrix', 'raps', 'most', 'are', 'missing', 'film', 'edition', 'Amazingly', 'video', 'also', 'seven', 'minutes', 'music', 'bluesy', 'jam', 'Hear', 'My', 'Train', 'Comin', 'official', 'film', 'crew', 'missed.By', 'today', 'standards', 'black-and-white', 'video', 'images', 'are', 'primitive', 'intimacy', 'footage', 'priceless', 'Where', 'videotape', 'technical', 'trouble', 'editors', 'have', 'substituted', '16mm', 'film', 'clips', 'always', 'perfectly', 'sync', 'music', 'often', 'providing', 'alternative', 'angles', 'main', 'film', 'Essentially', 'get', 'two', 'views', 'Hendrix', 'spellbinding', 'performance', 'full-color', 'carefully', 'edited', 'multi-camera', 'edition', 'shot', 'primarily', 'front', 'stage', 'grainy', 'black-and-white', 'cin', 'eacute', 'v', 'eacute', 'rit', 'eacute', 'version', 'shot', 'behind.Disc', '2', 'also', 'three', 'mini-documentaries', 'press', 'conference', 'Harlem', 'held', 'shortly', 'Woodstock', 'watch', 'mellow', 'Hendrix', 'respond', 'questions', 'uptight', 'press', 'regarding', 'politics', 'drugs', 'society', 'Cox', 'Lee', 'recall', 'times', 'spent', 'playing', 'clubs', 'Hendrix', 'Nashville', 'area', 'see', 'handful', 'photos', 'period', 'Finally', 'Kramer', 'detail', 'how', 'technical', 'challenges', 'recording', 'Hendrix', 'Woodstock', 'cool', 'booklet', 'Hendrix', 'handwritten', 'set', 'list', 'poetry', 'stage', 'photos', 'detailed', 'essay', 'how', 'film', 'crew', 'captured', 'event', 'package', 'expanded', 'Live', 'Woodstock', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'why', 'decades', 'death', 'Hendrix', 'rock', 'most', 'inventive', 'magical', 'guitarist']",N/A
