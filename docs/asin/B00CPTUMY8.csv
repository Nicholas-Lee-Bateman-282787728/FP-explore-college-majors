Season 5 dvds are very clear, the  color realistic and audio was crisp. The extra notes and commentary, etc. are very interesting and alert the viewer to watch for discrepancies the next time the discs are viewed; the bloopers and misses don't really take away from the story lines, rather they show how much attention or lack or attention was paid to details by producers. I like the fact that the episodes are self contained and not ongoing plot lines invloving regular cast members. You can select an individual story and not worry about what happened leading up to the episode.  Having a completely season in one box is preferable to having to deal with half season offerings. The big minus is lack of a definitive index of episodes on the box jacket or on the discs themselves.",4,A worthwhile series to own.,1384128000,"11 11, 2013",2013,899,"['like', 'more', 'story', 'content', 'embellishment', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'preference', 'b', 'w', 'color', 'Season', '5', 'dvds', 'are', 'very', 'clear', 'color', 'realistic', 'audio', 'was', 'crisp', 'extra', 'notes', 'commentary', 'etc', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'alert', 'viewer', 'watch', 'discrepancies', 'next', 'time', 'discs', 'are', 'viewed', 'bloopers', 'misses', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'take', 'away', 'story', 'lines', 'rather', 'show', 'how', 'much', 'attention', 'lack', 'attention', 'was', 'paid', 'details', 'producers', 'fact', 'episodes', 'are', 'self', 'contained', 'not', 'ongoing', 'plot', 'lines', 'invloving', 'regular', 'cast', 'members', 'can', 'select', 'individual', 'story', 'not', 'worry', 'what', 'happened', 'leading', 'up', 'episode', 'Having', 'completely', 'season', 'one', 'box', 'preferable', 'having', 'deal', 'season', 'offerings', 'big', 'minus', 'lack', 'definitive', 'index', 'episodes', 'box', 'jacket', 'discs']",Combat!: Season 5

1650003,A331VBP9BPGEOG,B00CPTUMY8,Thomas Colladay,"[4, 4]","If you have seen Combat when it was on television, then I actually need say no more.  This 5th Season set is in color.  Too bad the others were not, but the black-and-white ones are just as good in reality.  The main cast is five soldiers who are in the European Theater of WWII.  It is so well done that it has been recognized as one of the best series on television.  Vic Morrow is excellent as the Sargent who commands the others most of the time.  While he speaks his role, it is a joy to &#34;read his face&#34; at times when he does not speak, but you, as the viewer&#34; know what he is thinking.  It is classic, as is the whole series from volume one through to volume 5.  If you are new to Combat, it is very low on &#34;blood and guts&#34; unlike what is to be found in todays TV and films - it has meaningful content and will focus and lock your attention through each episode - that I can promise!",5,Combat! on TV,1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,909,"['have', 'seen', 'Combat', 'when', 'was', 'television', 'then', 'actually', 'need', 'say', 'more', '5th', 'Season', 'set', 'color', 'Too', 'bad', 'others', 'were', 'not', 'black-and-white', 'ones', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'reality', 'main', 'cast', 'five', 'soldiers', 'who', 'are', 'European', 'Theater', 'WWII', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'been', 'recognized', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'television', 'Vic', 'Morrow', 'excellent', 'Sargent', 'who', 'others', 'most', 'time', 'role', 'joy', '34', 'read', 'face', '34', 'times', 'when', 'not', 'speak', 'viewer', '34', 'know', 'what', 'thinking', 'classic', 'whole', 'series', 'volume', 'one', 'volume', '5', 'are', 'new', 'Combat', 'very', 'low', '34', 'blood', 'guts', '34', 'what', 'be', 'found', 'todays', 'TV', 'films', 'meaningful', 'content', 'will', 'focus', 'lock', 'attention', 'episode', 'can', 'promise']",Combat!: Season 5
