You see, in the next movie, Macgyver is on the run, as he gets framed for a crime he didn't commit.  Sorta like the movie the Fugitive or the 2nd season of Prison break.  So you get 90 minutes of him on the run from the police which is sorta unique.You'll love this even more if like me you have an interest in economics or politics.  In this movie their is a 1 or 2 minute debate, about whether communism is real, if their are a few people who fund communism, making a profit from the people at the bottom.

They are good but you see where they could have been bonus episodes not T.V. movies. I was going to order three of them one for my husband and one for each of my sons but after seeing it once I only ordered one. My boys who love MacGyver they didn't like this much. It's a great character but the movies are drawn out. In my opinion they should have maybe combined the two rather than make them two seperate movies.,5,Not what I expected.,1282608000,"08 24, 2010",2010,524,"['MacGyver', 'again', 'made', 'T.V', 'movies', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'episodes', 'are', 'drawn', 'out', 'are', 'good', 'see', 'where', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bonus', 'not', 'T.V', 'movies', 'was', 'going', 'order', 'three', 'one', 'husband', 'one', 'sons', 'seeing', 'once', 'only', 'ordered', 'one', 'boys', 'who', 'love', 'MacGyver', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'much', 'great', 'character', 'movies', 'are', 'drawn', 'out', 'opinion', 'should', 'have', 'maybe', 'combined', 'two', 'rather', 'make', 'two', 'seperate', 'movies']",N/A
