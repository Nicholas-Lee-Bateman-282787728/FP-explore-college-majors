Cronyn and Tandy are perfect for their roles and will draw you into this story as though it happened to you. This is one of the best Hallmark has to offer.

It stars Hume Cronyn as Sam, a farmer, who's beloved wife of fifty years, Cora, has died.  The couple were devoted to each other in life, and Cora's spirit,  in the form of a beautiful white dog, returns to look after Sam and help him in his time of grief.  The old man is greatly comforted by the dog, whom he alone can see, and as his own health ebbs, he faces his own death with anticipation, for he knows he will see his Cora again.Was there ever a better acting couple than Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn?  Their life experiences etched into every line of their gentle faces, and their real love evident in their eyes, their performances bring not only tears, but also a sense of awe for their profound talents.  They play simple people with such charisma that you simply cannot take your eyes off of them.  The script is guaranteed to tug at your heartstrings and send the hopeful message that death is not necessarily the end for those who truly love.

It shares a similarity with another movie this couple made called Firefox also starring John Denver as their son. The title To Dance With the White Dog comes from an unwelcome gift to an aging widower, Mr. Peek, in the form of a walker. He tries it out just to please his son but his face tells us he does not like it until a strange white dog who had come out of nowhere earlier in the movie to become his friend places her forepaws on the bars and actually dances with him. We watch as Peek tries to bake the biscuits his departed wife did so well, and try to convince his family of the dog's existence. He sets off on a road trip with just his dog for company and winds up in need of family help. When the movie nears its end, well, you will just have to watch the movie, so full of family members giving all sorts of advice and cautions to the patriarch who is not about to listen to any of them.

When Cora dies Sam is befriended by a white dog who stays with him through his last days. What makes this movie so poignant is that Jessica Tandy and Humn Cronyn were married for fifty plus years like the characters and the year this was released Jessica Tandy died of cancer. THis movie really celebrates a special love these two characters had and at the same time shows the relationships with their children and the issues faced by a lot of older people- losing a spouse, health declining, and maintaining independence. To me the movie was about how love can live forever and that the magic between two people will live on. Jessica Tandy was luminious in this movie- she just glowed and was so amazing and elegant- what a class act- both of them are. Humn Cronyn was very good as well as Sam Peek. It was so bittersweet watching Jessica Tandy in the DVD extras talking about life and how it should be enjoyed such a short time before her death.
