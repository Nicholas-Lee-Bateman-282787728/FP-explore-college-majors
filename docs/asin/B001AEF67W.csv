Very irritating mistake...Upon first glance, this is a KIDS show that likely could be viewed on whatever channel keeps hacking up popular anime from Japan and changing everything around to make everything happy, mindless, and complete with lessons for kids...But sure enough, there are humorous adult themes mixed in and thankfully, the company chose to keep them in rather than edit them out. Example in point? One of the girl characters is in love with another girl character and practices voodoo magic on her rivals...Other than that angle, the character was very similar to Grenda in Petite Princess Yucie...Another example, probably the best, is a joke where one teacher tells another that she will have to get on her knees and beg the mothers of the kids for forgiveness -the other teacher says that she'll have to do that for the fathers. It these type of jokes that you almost could miss that spice up the show and make it more entertaining.The cast is taken directly from the Tenchi universe with Sasami, Washu, Mihoshi, and of course Ryo Ohki the CABBIT. Although Ryo has a new mischievous personality instead of cuddly.Sasami is the title character -once the little sister alien in Tenchi turned magical girl in Magical Project S: Pretty Sammy and she has magical powers she inherited from her father. Misao also appears, but not as the amazing Pixy Misa rival, but rather shy awkward Misao.Each girl has powers that they are not in control of; Sasami can move things, and the others range from little demons snakes/shadows, size changing, wind, voodoo...that's how they meet and become friends although they have nothing else in common. A very strange teacher appears to recruit them, along with the Janitor, and poses as the school nurse. There are immature themes and mature themes, but overall it's very enjoyable.In closing, the things that may annoy you are:*The name mispronunciation (EVERY time!)*Sasami's squeeky high-pitched English voice*The lesson of the day in every episode theme*Not much actual magical girl content*The English version of the theme song",4,Humorous adult themes hidden in the mix...and not so magical...,1284249600,"09 12, 2010",2010,2125,"['First', 'not', 'sah-summy', 'Sah-sah-mi', 'Very', 'irritating', 'mistake', 'first', 'glance', 'KIDS', 'show', 'likely', 'could', 'be', 'viewed', 'channel', 'keeps', 'hacking', 'up', 'popular', 'anime', 'Japan', 'changing', 'everything', 'make', 'everything', 'happy', 'mindless', 'complete', 'lessons', 'kids', 'sure', 'enough', 'are', 'humorous', 'adult', 'themes', 'mixed', 'thankfully', 'company', 'chose', 'keep', 'rather', 'edit', 'out', 'Example', 'point', 'One', 'girl', 'characters', 'love', 'girl', 'character', 'practices', 'voodoo', 'magic', 'rivals', 'Other', 'angle', 'character', 'was', 'very', 'similar', 'Grenda', 'Petite', 'Princess', 'Yucie', 'example', 'probably', 'best', 'joke', 'where', 'one', 'teacher', 'will', 'have', 'get', 'knees', 'beg', 'mothers', 'kids', 'forgiveness', '-the', 'other', 'teacher', ""'ll"", 'have', 'do', 'fathers', 'type', 'jokes', 'almost', 'could', 'miss', 'spice', 'up', 'show', 'make', 'more', 'entertaining.The', 'cast', 'taken', 'directly', 'Tenchi', 'universe', 'Sasami', 'Washu', 'Mihoshi', 'course', 'Ryo', 'Ohki', 'CABBIT', 'Ryo', 'new', 'mischievous', 'personality', 'instead', 'cuddly.Sasami', 'title', 'character', '-once', 'little', 'sister', 'alien', 'Tenchi', 'turned', 'magical', 'girl', 'Magical', 'Project', 'S', 'Pretty', 'Sammy', 'magical', 'powers', 'inherited', 'father', 'Misao', 'also', 'not', 'amazing', 'Pixy', 'Misa', 'rival', 'rather', 'shy', 'Misao.Each', 'girl', 'powers', 'are', 'not', 'control', 'Sasami', 'can', 'move', 'things', 'others', 'range', 'little', 'demons', 'snakes/shadows', 'size', 'changing', 'wind', 'voodoo', 'how', 'meet', 'become', 'friends', 'have', 'nothing', 'else', 'common', 'very', 'strange', 'teacher', 'recruit', 'Janitor', 'school', 'nurse', 'are', 'immature', 'themes', 'mature', 'themes', 'overall', 'very', 'enjoyable.In', 'closing', 'things', 'may', 'annoy', 'are', '*The', 'name', 'mispronunciation', 'EVERY', 'time', '*Sasami', 'squeeky', 'high-pitched', 'English', 'voice*The', 'lesson', 'day', 'episode', 'theme*Not', 'much', 'actual', 'magical', 'girl', 'content*The', 'English', 'version', 'theme', 'song']",Sasami: Magical Girls Club: Season 1 S.A.V.E.
1165654,A2LS6A1XNO8Y7,B001AEF67W,Nurse Washu,"[8, 9]","It's billed as a spin-off of Tenchi Muyo and while this is not altogether incorrect, Sasami Magical Girls Club is more properly a spin off of Pretty Sammy/Magical Project S. Returning from Magical Project S are our spunky heroine Sasami, her dreadfully shy best friend Misao, Sasami's parents Hanoka and Ginji, Sasami's teacher Mihoshi, and one of my all-time favorite anime characters - the unforgettable Washu. However, the resemblance to the earlier Pretty Sammy material ends rather quickly. Indeed, even before you open the plastic wrap you will notice that the cover artwork and character designs are very different. So different, that I actually checked to see if AIC (Anime International Co.) even produced Sasami Magical Girls Club and I was pleasantly surprised to find out that they did.The basic premise to the story is similar in many ways to Harry Potter. In ages of the distant past, normal humans and witches (magic users) co-existed harmoniously, but over time this changed and non-magical people began to fear and oppressively persecute the witches. So great was their plight that the witches retreated into a hidden world where they could leave in peace. Eventually this was forgotten by normal humans over the course of history, that is until new groups of magic users began to emerge randomly in the human world. And so enters Sasami and her friends.There is so much about Sasami Magical Girls Club that is different from anything previously associated with Tenchi Muyo, that attempting to use the older franchise as a yardstick to judge this new series would fail miserably. It really needs to stand on its own merits and in that regard it exceeds quite well. The story is told very evenly without revealing too much too early or dragging it out too much. Many themes such as friendship, social acceptance, and self esteem are very appropriate for the age group this show is intended for and provide some lovely drama for us older viewers as well. Like with Magical Project S, the shoujo and angst dimensions are much more pronounced than with the normally shounen Tenchi Muyo. The writing and intricate plotlines are superb, and I did find the anime artwork to be very cute and pleasing, even though it is so different from AIC's previous works like EL Hazard, and Ah! My Goddess. I should also mention that the soundtrack is wonderful and I found the harp music in the theme for Sasami and Amitav especially beautiful.All in all, I enjoyed Sasami Magical Girls Club a great deal. If you're more of a Tenchi traditionalist and prefer the original works, you might not enjoy it so much. But if like me you love Tenchi Muyo in all forms, especially Pretty Sammy, then this series is not to be missed. AIC did a wonderful job in giving new life to an aged franchise, making it new and refreshing once again.",4,"Everything about this is different, but in a good way.",1234656000,"02 15, 2009",2009,2827,"['billed', 'spin-off', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'not', 'altogether', 'incorrect', 'Sasami', 'Magical', 'Girls', 'Club', 'more', 'properly', 'spin', 'Pretty', 'Sammy/Magical', 'Project', 'S.', 'Returning', 'Magical', 'Project', 'S', 'are', 'spunky', 'heroine', 'Sasami', 'dreadfully', 'shy', 'best', 'friend', 'Misao', 'Sasami', 'parents', 'Hanoka', 'Ginji', 'Sasami', 'teacher', 'Mihoshi', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'anime', 'characters', 'unforgettable', 'Washu', 'However', 'resemblance', 'earlier', 'Pretty', 'Sammy', 'material', 'rather', 'quickly', 'Indeed', 'even', 'open', 'plastic', 'wrap', 'will', 'notice', 'cover', 'artwork', 'character', 'designs', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'So', 'different', 'actually', 'checked', 'see', 'AIC', 'Anime', 'International', 'Co.', 'even', 'produced', 'Sasami', 'Magical', 'Girls', 'Club', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'out', 'did.The', 'basic', 'premise', 'story', 'similar', 'many', 'ways', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'ages', 'distant', 'past', 'normal', 'humans', 'witches', 'magic', 'users', 'co-existed', 'harmoniously', 'time', 'changed', 'non-magical', 'people', 'began', 'fear', 'oppressively', 'persecute', 'witches', 'So', 'great', 'was', 'plight', 'witches', 'retreated', 'hidden', 'world', 'where', 'could', 'leave', 'peace', 'Eventually', 'was', 'forgotten', 'normal', 'humans', 'course', 'history', 'new', 'groups', 'magic', 'users', 'began', 'emerge', 'randomly', 'human', 'world', 'so', 'enters', 'Sasami', 'friends.There', 'so', 'much', 'Sasami', 'Magical', 'Girls', 'Club', 'different', 'anything', 'previously', 'associated', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'attempting', 'use', 'older', 'franchise', 'yardstick', 'judge', 'new', 'series', 'would', 'fail', 'miserably', 'really', 'stand', 'own', 'merits', 'regard', 'quite', 'well', 'story', 'told', 'very', 'evenly', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'early', 'dragging', 'out', 'too', 'much', 'Many', 'themes', 'such', 'friendship', 'social', 'acceptance', 'esteem', 'are', 'very', 'appropriate', 'age', 'group', 'show', 'intended', 'provide', 'lovely', 'drama', 'older', 'viewers', 'well', 'Magical', 'Project', 'S', 'shoujo', 'angst', 'dimensions', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'pronounced', 'normally', 'shounen', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'writing', 'intricate', 'plotlines', 'are', 'superb', 'did', 'find', 'anime', 'artwork', 'be', 'very', 'cute', 'pleasing', 'even', 'so', 'different', 'AIC', 'previous', 'works', 'EL', 'Hazard', 'Ah', 'Goddess', 'should', 'also', 'mention', 'soundtrack', 'wonderful', 'found', 'harp', 'music', 'theme', 'Sasami', 'Amitav', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'Sasami', 'Magical', 'Girls', 'Club', 'great', 'deal', ""'re"", 'more', 'Tenchi', 'traditionalist', 'prefer', 'original', 'works', 'might', 'not', 'enjoy', 'so', 'much', 'love', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'forms', 'especially', 'Pretty', 'Sammy', 'then', 'series', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'AIC', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'giving', 'new', 'life', 'aged', 'franchise', 'making', 'new', 'refreshing', 'once', 'again']",Sasami: Magical Girls Club: Season 1 S.A.V.E.

The series basic short info is that you have a young group of elementary school girls who for some reason or another have or start to develop magical powers and because of this they must be trained on how to use their powers somewhat responsibly by being trained by two teachers learned an the magical lore,  but since of course this is a more humorous anime you'll see more than your share of bumbling hi jinx along the way.  The animation is reminiscent of the pokeman series a little but still good and the soundtrack matches the series very good as well,  the voice cast for the English actors and actresses sis their character roles very well but I feel that the Japanese voice cast especially for the five young magical girls fit better for the series.  Surprisingly the box set for the first set gives the video format as standard but actually both the first and second season box sets video is wide-screen format, the extras with most box sets isn't anything really great just the usual trailers and textless intro/ending songs.
