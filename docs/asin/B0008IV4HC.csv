It's nice because 45 minutes is the cardio/kickboxing and the remaining 30 minutes is the lower body core work. It's nice to have the option of doing the workout in its entirety or just choosing the kickboxing work. I find it challenging (intermediate). Nice if you want to supplement your regimen with higher intensity workouts.",4,Great workout!,1356739200,"12 29, 2012",2012,421,"['good', 'workout', 'want', 'combine', 'cardio', 'kickboxing', 'lower', 'body', 'core', 'work', 'nice', '45', 'minutes', 'cardio/kickboxing', 'remaining', '30', 'minutes', 'lower', 'body', 'core', 'work', 'nice', 'have', 'option', 'doing', 'workout', 'entirety', 'just', 'choosing', 'kickboxing', 'work', 'find', 'challenging', 'intermediate', 'Nice', 'want', 'supplement', 'regimen', 'higher', 'intensity', 'workouts']",N/A

899235,A27TQA0XCZUXZY,B0008IV4HC,Feles31,"[5, 6]","I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.Cathe as an instructor is alright for me, neither love nor hate.My number one thought through this workout is:  Why did they title this kick max?  They probably had the least focus on kicks.Secondly, they should have titled this jump max with all the jumping jacks, jump rope, jump in place you do.Overall, I found the kickbox combo sections awful.  For me, the moves were messy and awkward and I barely broke a sweat.  Hardly any cuing but you can pick up the basic punches and kicks since the combos are repeated quite a lot.The plyo/cardio segement was HARD and high impact.  Jump, jump, jump.  This is my second Cathe workout and I notice you probably need to double up on your sport bras for Cathe's workouts (I say this with a very modest bra size.)  I think Cathe is really in her element with this style and cuing and moves flowed much smoother.  Not a huge fan of high impact, tho.At this point, I was ready to donate this workout, but then came the kick drills with the chair.  Excellent burn and good for working on form.  Keeping this DVD on the strength of the kick drills segment.  I can use the plyo/cardio + kick drills as a workout and skip the kickbox segments.",3,kickbox portion is not the strong point,1288224000,"10 28, 2010",2010,1233,"['consider', 'intermediate', 'level', 'fitness.Cathe', 'instructor', 'alright', 'love', 'hate.My', 'number', 'one', 'thought', 'workout', 'Why', 'did', 'title', 'kick', 'max', 'probably', 'had', 'least', 'focus', 'kicks.Secondly', 'should', 'have', 'titled', 'jump', 'max', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'jump', 'rope', 'jump', 'place', 'do.Overall', 'found', 'kickbox', 'combo', 'sections', 'awful', 'moves', 'were', 'messy', 'awkward', 'barely', 'broke', 'sweat', 'Hardly', 'cuing', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'basic', 'punches', 'kicks', 'combos', 'are', 'repeated', 'quite', 'lot.The', 'plyo/cardio', 'segement', 'was', 'HARD', 'high', 'impact', 'Jump', 'jump', 'jump', 'second', 'Cathe', 'workout', 'notice', 'probably', 'need', 'double', 'up', 'sport', 'bras', 'Cathe', 'workouts', 'say', 'very', 'modest', 'bra', 'size', 'think', 'Cathe', 'really', 'element', 'style', 'cuing', 'moves', 'flowed', 'much', 'smoother', 'Not', 'huge', 'fan', 'high', 'impact', 'tho.At', 'point', 'was', 'ready', 'donate', 'workout', 'then', 'came', 'kick', 'chair', 'Excellent', 'burn', 'good', 'working', 'form', 'Keeping', 'DVD', 'strength', 'kick', 'segment', 'can', 'use', 'plyo/cardio', '+', 'kick', 'workout', 'skip', 'kickbox', 'segments']",N/A

The video is well-made and great for the beginning exerciser, but I did not find it challenging at all and hardly broke a sweat except briefly during the bootcamp segment.  I usually workout with either Billy Blanks' Get Ripped Advanced Tae Bo series or by taking kickboxing classes at the gym.  Compared to these, this video simply doesn't cut it and is much too slow-paced for the advanced level exerciser.",3,"Great for beginners, not-so-much for the advanced exerciser",1142899200,"03 21, 2006",2006,519,"['bought', 'video', 'high', 'expectations', 'reading', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'was', 'really', 'disappointed', 'video', 'well-made', 'great', 'beginning', 'exerciser', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'challenging', 'hardly', 'broke', 'sweat', 'briefly', 'bootcamp', 'segment', 'usually', 'workout', 'Billy', 'Blanks', 'Get', 'Ripped', 'Advanced', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'series', 'taking', 'kickboxing', 'classes', 'gym', 'Compared', 'video', 'simply', ""n't"", 'cut', 'much', 'too', 'slow-paced', 'advanced', 'level', 'exerciser']",N/A
899238,A271TPS6T13TW7,B0008IV4HC,J. Richman,"[37, 37]","I have been boxing training (in a gym with a personal trainer/former professional boxer and at home with dvds) for years, and before I did this workout for the first time, I had been working out for a year consistently with the Janis Saffell and Guillermo Gomez dvd ""Hardcore Kickbox Circuit.""  After a year of doing that challenging workout, I wasn't sweating with it as much, and needed a new challenge to keep advancing my fitness.  I ordered this dvd looking for a greater challenge, and wow did I get it!I tried to do Cathe's workout from start to finish (75 minutes), and found I couldn't even come close to doing all of the reps and exercises (particularly the plyometric ""blasts"" and the ""bootcamp challenge"" toning exercises).  This workout definitely is a challenge for the intermediate to advanced exerciser, and those few who reviewed the dvd as ""too easy"" must be professional hardbodies because otherwise I cannot believe their reviews are accurate even for them (or they stopped working out after the warm-up).  Now, after having worked out with this dvd consistently for a couple of weeks, I can complete two of my favorite ""Premixes"" (a great feature of this dvd): the 48 minute ""Timesaver"" and the 50 minute ""Kickbox Bootcamp Challenge.""  I still have not completed every rep of the 75 minute full video from start to finish, and look forward to doing so.Bottom line:  this is a hard workout that will grow with you, and you will sweat a lot while your heart and breathing rate go way up (particularly during the plyometric sections).  Cathe makes the workout fun (she reminds you to ""get your game face on"" and she means it!) without being overly cute about it.  I can also say, having worked with a professional boxing trainer, Cathe's punch technique is spot-on and fierce, and a good tool for those who want to continue to hone their punching technique while they become more fit.  If you enjoy kickboxing and a hard workout, this dvd is for you!",5,Challenging and fun workout!

Cathe is one of the best cuers out there and so you know ahead of time what's next.  You need good instruction here because you are so busy huffing and puffing and sweating, you don't want to have to worry about your next move before you need to.  It's one of the most challenging kickbox workouts I've ever done.It's broken up into three segments.  You can either choose one only or two or if you are in the mood for some tough 'punishment' then you can do all three together for the most effective workout.  It's about 75 minutes all up, and let me say - this ain't for the faint of heart.  Do not make the mistake of thinking you can get through this if you are new to exercising.

I like the different sections, e.g. kickboxing routines, high impact drills, leg conditioning and a stretch.What I enjoyed about this DVD:**the strong beat of the music helped me put more intensity into my punching and kicking.**the uncluttered set and minimal background exercisers. Jai and Lorraine join Cathe for this workout.  I love watching them both; they are very fit and have meticulous kickboxing form.**the variety. It's nice to have 30 minutes of kickboxing, 15 minutes of high intensity drills, 15 minutes of leg conditioning and a stretch.  I can get tired of kickboxing, but I don't with this variety.**it's intense!  I know several other reviewers said they didn't find it intense enough and I usually agree that Cathe's kickboxing workouts aren't that intense.
