She thinks he is a charming bad boy and wonders why he is sticking his nose in her detective work.  He has an insight on her that shows there is more to him than meets the eye.  His homelife is a story all its own - we have a teenager that we can actually adore who has a brilliant future ahead of her, but several ex-wives and a mother who lives in the world of the theater.  I love Castle's writer friends who play poker - real life authors who poke fun at Castle and give an authenticity to the show. Great ensemble cast with great mysteries to solve.  Castle's contributions have more than once been key to finding the killer, but I think his best contribution has been the expresso machine for the precinct.

Instead of giving us another CSI: Louisville or Law And Order: The Special Parking Squad, the minds at ABC Studios came up with something a bit newer, a little quirky, overall very entertaining and a boon to us writers, a hero named Richard Castle.Castle introduces us to the series lead, Richard Castle (Nathan Fillion, Firefly), a writer that has the time honored problem that plagues all writers; writer's block.  On the surface Castle has all the things we writers aspire to; he's famous, he has a large (though it appears mostly female) following, he's rich, and his poker buddies are other famous writers.  However he is also a single father of a teenage daughter, Alexis (Molly C. Quinn, My One and Only) who is a fair match for her father's intellect, and has to deal with his mother, Martha Rodgers (Susan Sullivan, Dharma and Greg) who relives her glory days on Broadway, thinks her son's career needs her guidance, while also living with them.Castle's opposite is an attractive, street-smart NYPD homicide detective, Kate Beckett (Stana Katic, The Spirit) who is driven to solve unusual cases, and has deep reasons for doing so.  Her, and subsequently her team, Javier Esposito (Jon Huertas, NCIS) and Kevin Ryan (Seamus Dever, Army Wives), are unwillingly drawn into Castle's world, when his invades Beckett's in a series of murders, based on Castle's novels.The chemistry of the two leads (Fillion and Katic) is substantial and the duo play well against each other, but more importantly the supporting cast is just as strong; which also include Lanie Parish (Tamala Jones, The Wood) a medical examiner and friend of Beckett, Roy Montgomery (Ruben Santiago-Hudson, The West Wing) Beckett's boss who is frequently amused at Castle's irritation of Beckett, Meridith (Darby Staunchfield, Private Practice) Castle's first ex-wife who brings a new definition to ""deep fried Twinkie"" (trust me, you just have to see the episode).  The viewers should offer kudos to the casting people and the writers, for putting together this team.After their initial investigation, Castle has decided that he has found his muse and the answer to his writer's block, in the form of Detective Beckett.  Using his considerable pull with the mayor of the city, he manages to get assigned to Beckett's team, while she works her cases; he takes notes for his new book series.Cleverly written, quality acting and inviting to viewers, Castle, blends together some of the better characteristics of former television detectives, such as Remington Steel/Laura Holt and Maddie Hayes/David Addison.If you enjoy a good police story and a little comedy touch to your drama, then you should be watching Castle.",5,"The best writer on TV, a review of Castle",1273449600,"05 10, 2010",2010,2850,"['vast', 'wasteland', 'Network', 'television', 'occasionally', 'bright', 'flame', 'will', 'appear', 'usually', 'snuffed', 'out', 'can', 'find', 'voice', 'viewer', 'following', 'Instead', 'giving', 'CSI', 'Louisville', 'Law', 'Order', 'Special', 'Parking', 'Squad', 'minds', 'ABC', 'Studios', 'came', 'up', 'something', 'bit', 'newer', 'little', 'quirky', 'overall', 'very', 'entertaining', 'boon', 'writers', 'hero', 'named', 'Richard', 'Castle.Castle', 'series', 'lead', 'Richard', 'Castle', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'Firefly', 'writer', 'time', 'honored', 'problem', 'writers', 'writer', 'block', 'surface', 'Castle', 'things', 'writers', 'aspire', 'famous', 'large', 'mostly', 'female', 'following', 'rich', 'poker', 'buddies', 'are', 'other', 'famous', 'writers', 'However', 'also', 'single', 'father', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Alexis', 'Molly', 'C.', 'Quinn', 'My', 'One', 'Only', 'who', 'fair', 'match', 'father', 'intellect', 'deal', 'mother', 'Martha', 'Rodgers', 'Susan', 'Sullivan', 'Dharma', 'Greg', 'who', 'glory', 'days', 'Broadway', 'son', 'career', 'guidance', 'also', 'living', 'them.Castle', 'opposite', 'attractive', 'street-smart', 'NYPD', 'homicide', 'detective', 'Kate', 'Beckett', 'Stana', 'Katic', 'Spirit', 'who', 'driven', 'solve', 'unusual', 'cases', 'deep', 'reasons', 'doing', 'so', 'Her', 'subsequently', 'team', 'Javier', 'Esposito', 'Jon', 'Huertas', 'NCIS', 'Kevin', 'Ryan', 'Seamus', 'Dever', 'Army', 'Wives', 'are', 'unwillingly', 'drawn', 'Castle', 'world', 'when', 'invades', 'Beckett', 'series', 'murders', 'based', 'Castle', 'novels.The', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'Fillion', 'Katic', 'substantial', 'duo', 'play', 'well', 'other', 'more', 'importantly', 'supporting', 'cast', 'just', 'strong', 'also', 'include', 'Lanie', 'Parish', 'Tamala', 'Jones', 'Wood', 'medical', 'examiner', 'friend', 'Beckett', 'Roy', 'Montgomery', 'Ruben', 'Santiago-Hudson', 'West', 'Wing', 'Beckett', 'boss', 'who', 'frequently', 'amused', 'Castle', 'irritation', 'Beckett', 'Meridith', 'Darby', 'Staunchfield', 'Private', 'Practice', 'Castle', 'first', 'ex-wife', 'who', 'new', 'definition', 'deep', 'fried', 'Twinkie', 'just', 'have', 'see', 'episode', 'viewers', 'should', 'offer', 'kudos', 'casting', 'people', 'writers', 'putting', 'together', 'team.After', 'initial', 'investigation', 'Castle', 'decided', 'found', 'muse', 'answer', 'writer', 'block', 'form', 'Detective', 'Beckett', 'Using', 'considerable', 'pull', 'mayor', 'city', 'get', 'assigned', 'Beckett', 'team', 'cases', 'notes', 'new', 'book', 'series.Cleverly', 'written', 'quality', 'acting', 'inviting', 'viewers', 'Castle', 'together', 'better', 'characteristics', 'former', 'television', 'detectives', 'such', 'Remington', 'Steel/Laura', 'Holt', 'Maddie', 'Hayes/David', 'Addison.If', 'enjoy', 'good', 'police', 'story', 'little', 'comedy', 'touch', 'drama', 'then', 'should', 'be', 'watching', 'Castle']",Castle: Season 1

It stands out for clever, witty dialog and truly inspired acting.  Unlike older shows along this formula, this one does not reset to zero (like Magnum PI).  There are story arcs that cross episodes and seasons.  Events and relationships generally have meaning.  Start with season one.As of this writing, there are five seasons of Castle on the market and the sixth begins in the coming months.  The show provides an island oasis of smart, sensitive entertainment in a sea of TV drek.The entire cast is outstanding, with such depth and plausibility that you fall into their world with them.

If you're old enough to remember, I have to liken Castle to a blend of ""Moon Lighting"", ""Columbo"", and ""Murder She Wrote"".The 30 second gist of the show is that Fillion is a crime writer who gets connected with an attractive detective and manages to convince the mayor (who Castle is friends with) that he should have unrestricted access to follow her around for inspiration.  He's also a huge asset to the NYPD with his understanding of criminal behavior etc.  Fillion is great and there is lots of comic relief surrounding the central murder plot so it's not a real downer to watch.As of the time of this writing, they are into Season 6.  We just started watching a few weeks ago, ripped through season 1 and are now into Season 2.

1245146,A189BPUDLRCQEQ,B001XRLWPQ,"B. Kemper ""Buzz""","[0, 1]","Okay, so being totally honest here: I do not want to like this show. I first stumbled onto it because I like Nathan Fillion (became a fan because of the Firefly series, which by the way, is really great Sci-Fi). This rating should really be 3.5 stars, but why quibble over half a star, right? First, the negative: this series is really formulaic: Filthy-rich, handsome mystery author Richard Castle decides to follow around super-hot (and smart--credit where credit is due), detective Kate Beckett and her NYPD colleagues to get inspiration for his novels. Because he is well-connected, he gets to follow the detectives around, even in very dangerous situations. Not very realistic, right? No. And of course Castle and Beckett didn't get along well at first. And of course, they now have a constant, though very manufactured-seeming, sexual tension throughout. It's like someone took every Buddy-Cop show cliche and wrote it into these scripts.But, you'll notice I gave it 4 stars (well 3.5, but who's counting). That's because I am a total sucker for decent &#34;Whodunit&#34; mystery shows. On some weird level, Castle and Beckett have a kind of Sherlock Holmes/John Watson thing going on--though at a noticeably lesser intellectual level--with the two of them constantly switching between the Holmes or Watson role. The observations and character development is not as good as the British &#34;Sherlock&#34; series (which is excellent, by the way), but it's good enough to be somehow simultaneously smart and mindless entertainment. At the end of a long day--and I've had a lot of them lately--watching an episode of Castle is just what I need. So, if the sitcoms you've been watching are a little TOO mindless, give this a try: it just might be the escape you're looking for.",4,Guilty Pleasure,1353369600,"11 20, 2012",2012,1779,"['Okay', 'being', 'totally', 'honest', 'here', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'like', 'show', 'first', 'stumbled', 'like', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'became', 'fan', 'Firefly', 'series', 'way', 'really', 'great', 'Sci-Fi', 'rating', 'should', 'really', 'be', '3.5', 'stars', 'why', 'quibble', 'star', 'right', 'First', 'negative', 'series', 'really', 'formulaic', 'Filthy-rich', 'handsome', 'mystery', 'author', 'Richard', 'Castle', 'follow', 'super-hot', 'smart', 'credit', 'where', 'credit', 'due', 'detective', 'Kate', 'Beckett', 'NYPD', 'colleagues', 'get', 'inspiration', 'novels', 'well-connected', 'follow', 'detectives', 'even', 'very', 'dangerous', 'situations', 'Not', 'very', 'realistic', 'right', 'No', 'course', 'Castle', 'Beckett', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'well', 'first', 'course', 'now', 'have', 'constant', 'though', 'very', 'manufactured-seeming', 'sexual', 'tension', 'someone', 'took', 'Buddy-Cop', 'show', 'cliche', 'wrote', 'scripts.But', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'well', '3.5', 'who', 'counting', 'am', 'total', 'sucker', 'decent', '34', 'Whodunit', '34', 'mystery', 'weird', 'level', 'Castle', 'Beckett', 'have', 'kind', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes/John', 'Watson', 'thing', 'going', 'noticeably', 'lesser', 'intellectual', 'level', 'two', 'constantly', 'switching', 'Holmes', 'Watson', 'role', 'observations', 'character', 'development', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'British', '34', 'Sherlock', '34', 'series', 'excellent', 'way', 'good', 'enough', 'be', 'somehow', 'simultaneously', 'smart', 'mindless', 'entertainment', 'end', 'long', 'day', ""'ve"", 'had', 'lot', 'lately', 'watching', 'episode', 'Castle', 'just', 'what', 'need', 'So', 'sitcoms', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'are', 'little', 'TOO', 'mindless', 'give', 'try', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'escape', ""'re"", 'looking']",Castle: Season 1

I realize it's to keep the story moving and viewers interested but really? They don't have to marry but they could have a relationship. All it does is encourage them to sleep around with others. Who'd want a relationship with someone like that?

Mom""","[0, 0]","Much as I am loath to watch yet another TV cop show - having gotten to the point in the last decade or so when I could see about every possible plot angle coming in the first five minutes - and about every possible buddy pairing imaginable - my daughter talked me into this one. ""Mom, it stars Nathan Fillion - Captain Mal! It can't possibly be that bad!""And to my mild surprise, it wasn't that bad; quite good, in fact: not for the actual crime-solving puzzles involved, but for the play of personalities - Richard Castle, the celebrity mystery author and dilettante, and Kate Beckett, the driven and earnest police detective, working together and striking creative and almost-but-not-quite romantic sparks off each other. In a lot of ways, it's a throwback, not just to TV shows like Moonlighting, but to 1930's William Powell and Myrna Loy, in ""The Thin Man"" series - an engaging merge of the who-dunnit with firecracker wit, sexual attraction and glamorous Manhattan, into one delicious trifle of intriguing characters and snappy conversation.The supporting characters are not neglected when it comes to delivering crackling good lines; notably Kate's work buddies, Detectives Esposito and Ryan, and the sharp-tongued medical examiner, Dr. Parish. Castle's personal life - he lives with a refreshingly grounded teenage daughter, and his mother, a flamboyant former Broadway star - rounds out the character of Castle. He is a good and responsible father, and possesses connections and skills - notably a writer's sharp observation and intuition about characters - which are a good fit for Beckett's determination and laser-sharp focus. In personalities, they are opposites: he is talkative, open, creative, whereas she is focused, stoic, and more inward. Part of the charm is how they act on each other - she opens up, just a little bit, and he seems to become a bit more responsible, as the season progresses.Of the extras included, the most amusing is ""Write Along With Nathan Fillion"" - where he and producer-writer Stephen Cannell spend the day together, in the interests of Fillion learning to be a mystery writer.

The book launch sequences were actually shot on location in New York City as part of a presentation before the show was picked up. Marlowe talks about the challenge of introducing all the regular characters while also telling a mystery story. Marlowe and Bowman talk about casting Fillion and Katic. Meanwhile, Fillion cracks jokes and is his usual entertaining self.The second disc includes a commentary on ""A Chill Goes Through Her Veins"" by Marlowe, Bowman, Fillion, Katic, Huertas and Molly Quinn. They talk about the challenge of filming on an actual construction site. Marlowe and Fillion talk about their approach to the character of Castle. Katic goes into detail about her character's backstory and how it informs what she does.Disc three starts off with two commentaries on ""A Death in the Family."" The first one features Marlowe, Bowman, Fillion, Katic, Huertas, and Quinn. Everyone banters back and forth while sharing anecdotes about shooting this episode. Katic talks about the dramatic material in this episode and how it changes the relationship between Castle and Beckett.There is also another commentary for this episode by Huertas and fellow cast member Seamus Dever. These guys crack jokes and praise the episode's guest stars. They also tell all sorts of filming anecdotes.""Whodunit: The Genesis of Castle"" features Andrew Marlowe talking about the origins of the show - a desire to hearken back to shows likeThe Rockford Files - Season OneandMoonlighting - Seasons 1 & 2. Fillion, Katic and the other regular cast members talk about their characters.""Castle's Godfather"" is an interview between Marlowe, Bowman and T.V. producer/writer and legend Stephen J. Cannell. Bowman knew Cannell when he was a kid and got his start on T.V. working for him. The two men share entertaining anecdotes about some of the shows they've worked on together.""Write-Along with Nathan Fillion"" is a hilarious mock-featurette as the actor spends the day with Cannell. The actor shows up to the man's house late and is forced to camp out until the next day. Fillion hangs on Cannell's every word but seems more impressed by the T.V. mogul's numerous classic cars. This is a fun extra as these two guys play well off each other.

Marlowe (""Air Force One"", ""End of Days"" and ""Hollyw Man"") and executive produced by Rob Bowman (""The A-Team"", ""The X-Files"", ""Day Break"") comes a new drama series on crime solving.The first season which featured 10 episodes stars actor Nathan Fillion (""Firefly"", ""Drive"" and ""Desperate Housewives"") as Richard Castle.  The famous mystery novelist who is adored by many but behind-the-scenes, he is a playboy who has an on-and-off fling with his ex-wife (who is an actress), another ex-wife who is his publisher and lives with his bright teenage daughter Alexis (Molly Quinn, ""My One and Only"") and his meddlesome mother and former Broadway actress, Martha Rodgers (Susan Sullivan, ""The Nine"", ""Dharma & Greg"").There is a lot of pressure on Nathan to create another book and with him stuck, his luck starts to change when he meets by-the-book Detective Kate Beckett (Stana Katic, ""Heroes"", ""The Spirit"", ""Quantum of Solace"") who is investigating several murders which have taken place and the way that they were done were like the murders featured in several of his novels.  Because of his knowledge of how things end up with his books, he gets the opportunity to assist the detectives in their case.Eventually, Richard Castle discovers that he can do several things in his life.  Write his new book based on Detective Beckett, see if he can woo Detective Beckett and most of all to investigate other murders which he can incorporate ideas for his new book.  At first, it seems implausible but with Castle being so well-known and friends with the mayor, Captain Montgomery (Ruben Santiago-Huds0n) will do what he can to make the mayor and his boss happy, so he allows Richard to tag along with Detective Beckett.Needless to say, she's not happy about it but with his skills of mystery writing and her skills as a detective, the two find out that together, they can be an effective duo in crime solving.

The drama series is quite slick as it gives you the feel of New York and like many abc studios related DVD releases, Disney has always done a good job with their TV show transfers.  A show that balances outdoor and indoor shots with good lighting, the picture quality for ""CASTLE"" is pretty solid.  I didn't see any major artifacting issues or low level noise that was distracting.As for the audio, the series is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  The series is front and center channel driven with a few episodes (that involve gun fights) utilizing the surround channels.  The series does utilize quite a bit of music and for the most, the series is understandable and clear.Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""CASTLE - The Complete First Season"" includes the following special features:DISC 1:* Audio Commentary for ""Flowers For Your Grave"" with Executive Producer Andrew Marlow, Executive Producer Rob Bowman, Actors Nathan Fillion, Stana Katic and Jon HuertasDISC 2:* Audio Commentary for ""A Chill Goes Through Her Veins"" with Executive Producer Andrew Marlow, Executive Producer Rob Bowman, Actors Nathan Fillion, Stana Katic, Jon Huertas and Molly QuinnDISC 3:* Audio Commentary for ""A Death in the Family"" with Executive Producer Andrew Marlow, Executive Producer Rob Bowman, Actors Nathan Fillion, Stana Katic, Jon Huertas and Molly Quinn* Audio Commentary for ""A Death in the Family"" with Seamus Dever and  Jon Huertas* Whodunit: The Genesis of Castle -(6:15) Andrew Marlowe talks about how he came up with the idea of ""Castle"".

Cannell (creator of ""A-Team"" and ""Rockford Files"").* Write-Along with Nathan Fillion - (9:07) A hilarious featurette featuring Nathan Fillion wanting to learn from Stephen J. Cannell.* Misdemeanors: Bloopers & Outtakes - (2:37) First season bloopers.JUDGMENT CALL:""CASTLE"" was definitely a surprise.  I can remember seeing the commercials during ""LOST"" but and for the most part, it kind of reminded me of the old ""Moonlighting"" years of crime investigation.  But after watching the first episode, I was instantly hooked.Both Rick Castle and Detective Kate Beckett are just polar opposites but you know that there is this sexual attraction there that makes their chemistry work onscreen.  In a way, both are like Bruce Wayne (Batman) in the way they are keen in investigating things.  Castle, as a mystery writer and having done a lot of research, puts himself in the shoes of the criminal and thinks of the many possibilities that can exist between the characters.  Detective Beckett, almost having a similar tragic Bruce Wayne story is a by-the-book detective and for the most part, have their unique way of feeding off each other in terms of handling a case.  But Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic do a great job and have good chemistry onscreen.So, far every episode has been intriguing, suspenseful and entertaining.  If there was one thing that tends to creep in my head that is more on the negative side, is just the serious aspects of a popular writer getting the opportunity to tag along a detective on her various cases.  I just have a hard time seeing the NYPD allowing such a thing and allowing a writer to get that close to the detectives.Granted, this may seem a bit farfetched but overall, the writers make it work.  Each of the characters are actually quite enjoyable to watch, especially Castle's meddling mother Martha and logical and intelligent daughter Alexis,  it's good to see Castle pulled out of his element once in awhile. Beckett's partners Detective Esposito and Ryan lend that serious but also comedic moment for the series.The first season of ""CASTLE"" has been quite enjoyable thus far.  I'm glad to hear that the series has been green lighted for a second season because ""CASTLE"" has been nothing but entertaining, fun and a suspenseful drama series thus far.""CASTLE - The Complete First Season"" is definitely worth checking out!",5,"Wow!  This show really rocks!

You can't help but like the episode when Alexis goes to the prom.

In the tradition of all the good murder mystery shows, this has wit, a good and strange murder, and even a hint of romance.What I love most and found the best quality of the show is the premise.  A famous murder mystery writer called in to use his eye for murders to help the police.  It's cute, it's clever, and it's a great spin on the genre.Add to that a very likable and memorable cast that still manages to stay within the realms of reality.  No one is too quirky, but everyone, part big or small, has enough personality to be endearing.

Johnson ""'ntohign slhe thaersam'""","[0, 0]","Though the season is a lot shorter than most runs, it barely takes a full episode to come to understand the pacing and mood. Fan favourite Nathan Fillion plays Richard Castle, a long time best-selling author with incredible wit and charisma. He dotes on his daughter (played beautifully by Molly Quinn) and adores his mother (Susan Sullivan). There is obviously a great chemistry between this television family.And then comes Detective Kate Beckett (a hard role to do justice, yet performed with subtle grace by Stana Katic), a hard-edged supercop who also happens to be a fan of the titular character. So when a crime scene mimics one that Castle has written into a novel, the detective goes to gain some insight from her literary guilty pleasure.And from there, comedy and crime drama explode like you wouldn't believe.There have been an annoying surge of crime dramas, some better, some worse. It is my opinion Castle ranks among the best. This season features a few commentaries, a few featurettes and a 5.1 digital sound track. I try pretty hard to avoid spoilers if at all possible, so I'll try and sum things up as best as possible: if you enjoy Fillion's other performances (Firefly and Serenity, White Noise 2, Slither) then you must watch this series as it is a more nuanced feel with many subtle layers. And of course, his real-world wit and charisma.

Through his friendship with the Mayor, he gets to team up with NY detective Kate Beckett and help her solve the various homicides that come their way.  Fillion who was terrific on the prematurely-cancelled ""Firefly"" is just as good here.  However it is Stana Katic as detective Beckett who really steals the show.  I had never seen this Canadian actress before, (except for a brief appearance at the conclusion of the Bond flick ""Quantum of Solace,"") but she is both likeable and sympthetic as the put-upon homicide detective.  She is tall, beautiful and moves like she must have done some modeling.  She and Fillion work well together.  They get great support from the other two male homicide detectives that assist them and are there for basically comic-relief.  Susan Sullivan also steals most scenes as the tart-tongued mother of ""Castle,"" a former Broadway star who lives with him and his precocious teenage daughter.  The daughter is excellently played by Molly Quinn, who among other things has the most beautiful blue eyes I've seen.This is a great show with wonderful dialogue, a terrific cast and great scripts.

Frankly, there's a lot of television series out there who could do with that sort of zing. CASTLE has got a nice gimmick, but no surprise that its success rests hugely on how Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic mesh onscreen. Thankfully for CASTLE, the two leads create sparks together.Best-selling mystery novelist and dashing man-about-town Richard Castle lives it up big. Got the fame and glamor, the wealth, and the beautiful broads. Castle gets involved with NYPD when a serial killer begins to lift murder scenes from his past novels. That case solved, Castle decides to stick around the precinct as a consultant, regarding this as an opportunity to harvest ideas for future bestsellers (he's kind of nursing this writer's block). This doesn't at all suit standoffish and driven NYPD Homicide Detective Kate Beckett, but she has no choice since Castle's got an in with the mayor. And, of course, Detective Beckett also being this beautiful babe doesn't have anything to do with Castle wanting to hang around. He sees her as a challenge. She calls him a ""nine-year-old on a sugar rush."" You get the picture.Are Castle and Beckett the sexiest sleuths since Temperance Brennan and Special Agent Seeley Booth? I dunno, but they're certainly in the running. Nathan Fillion - who should be on TV or in films as much as possible (don't give me that crap about his needing a personal life) - has got his easy-going rakish charm going on, the perfect foil to Stana Katic's uptight, chip-on-the-shoulder brand of sexy. There's nothing like that sly sexual tension wafting in the air, even as we realize that if these two ever do get together, it won't be until a good long while, with ABC milking the thing for all the Nielsen ratings it can squeeze out. Meanwhile, we soak in all that suggestive banter and innuendo.To be honest, the murder cases take a back seat. To me, they're only interesting in that they at times provide peeks into the makeup of the show's characters. Episode 6, for example, opens up Beckett's painful past as she makes a personal connection with the case at hand. We learn why she decided to become a police detective. But there's more to Kate Beckett than being prickly and a control freak. As she sasses to Castle: ""O so many layers to the Beckett onion - however will you peel them all?"" We learn more about her later on, especially when her old flame reappears and looks to be staying around for a while - because, as we know, there has to be that obligatory romantic third wheel.I dig that, although Castle may be big noise elsewhere, he's treated like a rookie in the precinct. In the first couple of episodes, he's often directed to stay in the car while the real detectives went off to investigate. Of course, Castle doesn't listen and sometimes ends up bumbling things. But, gradually, he wins Beckett's squad over, because the guy does have this outside-the-box intuitiveness. His vivid writer's imagination does come in handy, not to mention all his big time connections and also that espresso machine he just bought the squad. I get a kick out of how Rick Castle so gets a kick out of shadowing Beckett and crew. ""Nine-year-old on a sugar rush"" seems right. However, another perfectly apt quote regarding Castle comes from Castle himself: ""Some people love the institution, hate the day-to-day.""We'd think him a more frivolous guy than he really is, except early on we learn just how wonderful of a dad he is. His interactions with his teen daughter Alexis (Molly Quinn) continually provides some of the show's best ""aww"" moments. On the other hand, I can't stand Castle's over-the-top ex-stage actress mom.Only ten episodes, and the last one ends on a sort of cliffhanger, and I suspected that Castle was due to get his you-know-what handed to him by Beckett. As it is, the first episode of Season 2 deals largely with Castle attempting to fix the damaged relationship between him and Beckett.When we first meet Rick Castle, he'd just killed off his literary cash cow, Derek Storm. Beckett inspires him to create a new protagonist (and I laughed out loud at the premise - ""hooker by day, cop by night""), and part of the fun this season is in seeing Beckett so discomfited at being Castle's ""muse.""CASTLE: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON collects all ten episodes on three discs. The DVD bonus stuff: ""Misdemeanors: Bloopers & Outtakes (2:36 minutes); ""Whodunit: The Genesis of CASTLE"" (6:13 minutes); ""Write-Along with Nathan Fillion"" - Nathan hangs out with author/executive producer Stephen J. Cannell (9:07 minutes); ""CASTLE's Godfather"" - goes into how Stephen J. Cannell took Executive Producer Rob Bowman and Creator/Executive Producer Andrew Marlowe under his wing and taught them the ropes of the television biz (7:15 minutes).There are 4 audio commentaries on 3 episodes, with Nathan Fillion keeping things light: ""Flowers For Your Grave"" (Creator/Executive Producer Andrew Marlowe, Executive Producer Rob Bowman, Actors Nathan Fillion, Stana Katic, & Jon Huertas), ""A Chill Goes Through Her Veins"" (Andrew Marlowe, Rob Bowman, Nathan Fillion & Stana Katic, Jon Huertas & Molly Quinn), and ""A Death In The Family"" (two different commentaries for this episode, one with Andrew Marlowe, Rob Bowman, and Nathan Fillion, Stana Katic, Jon Huertas, & Molly Quinn; the other with actors Seamus Dever and Jon Huertas).Another cool moment pops up in the first episode, when Castle's poker buddies of the evening turn out to be James Patterson and Stephen J. Cannell. If you read mystery thrillers, then you've probably read their stuff. In my eyes, Rick Castle just gained that much more cachet. I am so glad there's a Season 2. I'll say it again, there's no need for Nathan Fillion to have a personal life. Just keep doing television and film, dude. And maybe a sequel to DR.

1245215,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B001XRLWPQ,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[125, 131]","CASTLE is one hell of an entertaining piece of light, fluffy cop television. It's the perfect antidote to those who are wallowing in the dark sewers of cop shows like LAW AND ORDER SVU or CRIMINAL INTENT or the brilliant but extreme THE SHIELD. Creator Andrew Marlowe, perhaps best known as the screenwriter for AIR FORCE ONE, has created a very breezy and incredibly fun cop show that's primary purpose is to counter the altogether too intense police procedurals that the public seems to inhale like cigarette smoke (you know it's not good for you, but you can't help it). He's also added the perfect actor for a show like this: Nathan Fillion. Many people weren't familiar with Fillion's work until he became a cast member of the horrifically awful DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES, but before that, he was a key player in what's known as The Whedonverse, starring in the all-too shortlived FIREFLY and also guest-starring in the final season of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. He was also featured in one of Whedon's more recent and brilliant creations, DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG, where he wonderfully plays a shallow, over-confident superhero. He also appeared in another VERY shortlived Fox television show called DRIVE, which was cut down before it could reach its potential. He's been featured in films like the FIREFLY sorta-sequel SERENITY, a wonderful indie splattergore comedy called SLITHER, and some unfortunate direct-to-DVD fare like WATER'S EDGE and WHITE NOISE 2: THE LIGHT. But as he proved with FIREFLY, he has more than enough talent and charisma to carry a show on his own if necessary (even though it wasn't necessary with how great FIREFLY was).And that's very much the case with CASTLE. As mystery writer Richard Castle, this is his show. Despite some strong supporting performances by actors like Susan Sullivan, who plays his flamboyant, vibrant, and at times, annoying mother, and a sometimes over-her-head Stana Katic as his professional and personal foil, NYPD Detective Kate Beckett, this show and everything great about it is planted rightly and firmly on the charm and talent of Fillion.The show is very much in the vein of a program like MOONLIGHTING, pitting the goofy yet irrestistably charming lothario against the by-the-book, stalwart, intelligent and sassy and undeniably sexy-but-sexless woman as the two of them get into one wild adventure after another. The thing about this show that gives it perhaps an even stronger catch than a show of this type should is that it has a specific ""mythology"" arc that will carry it for at least another season; namely the unsolved murder of Beckett's mother, and Castle's determination to solve it, even if it means that he will lose a friend and potential love interest in Beckett.So I say bring on Season Two, and continue the tone that the show has given us, and don't let it conform to what the ""hitmakers"" see trending with the too-upsetting cop shows. Keep it easy breezy. And hopefully the show will get the audience it deserves, and Fillion will get more of the opportunities he deserves.",4,"It's not reinventing the wheel, but it's almost perfect entertainment!",1243123200,"05 24, 2009",2009,3061,"['CASTLE', 'one', 'hell', 'entertaining', 'piece', 'light', 'fluffy', 'cop', 'television', 'perfect', 'antidote', 'who', 'are', 'wallowing', 'dark', 'sewers', 'cop', 'shows', 'LAW', 'ORDER', 'SVU', 'CRIMINAL', 'INTENT', 'brilliant', 'SHIELD', 'Creator', 'Andrew', 'Marlowe', 'perhaps', 'best', 'known', 'screenwriter', 'AIR', 'FORCE', 'ONE', 'created', 'very', 'breezy', 'incredibly', 'fun', 'cop', 'show', 'primary', 'purpose', 'counter', 'altogether', 'too', 'intense', 'police', 'procedurals', 'public', 'inhale', 'cigarette', 'smoke', 'know', 'not', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'also', 'added', 'perfect', 'actor', 'show', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'Many', 'people', 'were', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'Fillion', 'work', 'became', 'cast', 'member', 'horrifically', 'awful', 'DESPERATE', 'HOUSEWIVES', 'was', 'key', 'player', 'what', 'known', 'Whedonverse', 'starring', 'all-too', 'shortlived', 'FIREFLY', 'also', 'guest-starring', 'final', 'season', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'was', 'also', 'featured', 'one', 'Whedon', 'more', 'recent', 'brilliant', 'creations', 'DR.', 'HORRIBLE', 'SING-ALONG', 'BLOG', 'where', 'wonderfully', 'shallow', 'over-confident', 'superhero', 'also', 'appeared', 'VERY', 'shortlived', 'Fox', 'television', 'show', 'called', 'DRIVE', 'was', 'cut', 'down', 'could', 'reach', 'potential', 'been', 'featured', 'films', 'FIREFLY', 'sorta-sequel', 'SERENITY', 'wonderful', 'indie', 'splattergore', 'comedy', 'called', 'SLITHER', 'unfortunate', 'direct-to-DVD', 'fare', 'WATER', 'EDGE', 'WHITE', 'NOISE', '2', 'LIGHT', 'proved', 'FIREFLY', 'more', 'enough', 'talent', 'charisma', 'carry', 'show', 'own', 'necessary', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'how', 'great', 'FIREFLY', 'was', '.And', 'very', 'much', 'case', 'CASTLE', 'mystery', 'writer', 'Richard', 'Castle', 'show', 'strong', 'supporting', 'performances', 'actors', 'Susan', 'Sullivan', 'who', 'flamboyant', 'vibrant', 'times', 'annoying', 'mother', 'sometimes', 'over-her-head', 'Stana', 'Katic', 'professional', 'personal', 'foil', 'NYPD', 'Detective', 'Kate', 'Beckett', 'show', 'everything', 'great', 'planted', 'rightly', 'firmly', 'charm', 'talent', 'Fillion.The', 'show', 'very', 'much', 'vein', 'program', 'MOONLIGHTING', 'pitting', 'goofy', 'yet', 'irrestistably', 'charming', 'lothario', 'by-the-book', 'stalwart', 'intelligent', 'sassy', 'undeniably', 'sexy-but-sexless', 'woman', 'two', 'get', 'one', 'wild', 'adventure', 'thing', 'show', 'perhaps', 'even', 'stronger', 'catch', 'show', 'type', 'should', 'specific', 'mythology', 'arc', 'will', 'carry', 'least', 'season', 'namely', 'unsolved', 'murder', 'Beckett', 'mother', 'Castle', 'determination', 'solve', 'even', 'will', 'lose', 'friend', 'potential', 'love', 'interest', 'Beckett.So', 'say', 'bring', 'Season', 'Two', 'continue', 'tone', 'show', 'given', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'conform', 'what', 'hitmakers', 'see', 'trending', 'too-upsetting', 'cop', 'shows', 'Keep', 'easy', 'breezy', 'hopefully', 'show', 'will', 'get', 'audience', 'Fillion', 'will', 'get', 'more', 'opportunities']",Castle: Season 1

Well produced with excellent photography of NY (where I live), fine acting, good plot lines (I like the romance situation withBeckett & Castle) overall good casting and sets. and humor to boot.  Some of the stories appear to be inspired by some Bone episodes: the growing but slowly romantic connections, and the bickeringbetween a rich consultant and a tough cop like Booth and Dr Brennan.  That's ok because they are all well done, fun to watch and occasionally shed a tear or two: I am always the romantic!  CASTLEis a bit more realistic while BONES is a bit more sci fi & fantasy.

While Castle initially claims he's there to glean ideas and inspiration for his new series -- about a female detective named Nikki Heat, who is based on Beckett -- it's also clear that Castle loves the &#34;whodunnit&#34; angle of solving real-life cases.In addition, it quickly becomes clear that Castle is attracted to Beckett, a pretty and intelligent yet tough and no-nonsense cop. The writer and researcher in Castle almost immediately appraises Beckett, concluding that someone so smart and good-looking could've been anything she wanted, so there must be a specific reason for her choosing to join the police force. Castle's suspicions are fast affirmed, but it's also apparent that Beckett's past is too painful for her to discuss. Nonetheless, that's hardly a deterrent for someone like Castle, who only thinks it makes Beckett all the more intriguing.Rounding out the cast are Kevin Ryan (Seamus Dever) and Javier Esposito (Jon Huertas), two other NYPD detectives who work under Beckett for Captain Roy Montgomery (Ruben Santiago-Hudson); Castle's former-actress mother Martha Rodgers (Susan Sullivan) and teen daughter Alexis (Molly C. Quinn), both of whom live with him.Although Season 1 only has 9 episodes, it's a great way to become introduced to this quickly addicting series! If you enjoy mysteries, a bit of flirtation and a frequently sprinkling of witty banter and humor, definitely give Castle a try!",5,Not just another crime procedural...,1390953600,"01 29, 2014",2014,1918,"['best-selling', 'author', 'NYPD', 'detective', 'team', 'up', 'solve', 'difficult', 'crimes', 'utilizing', 'very', 'different', 'personalities', 'backgrounds', 'simultaneously', 'creating', 'appealing', 'show', 'everything', 'mystery', 'light-hearted', 'humor.Despite', 'initial', 'reluctance', 'Det', 'Kate', 'Beckett', 'Stana', 'Katic', 'tailed', 'job', 'Richard', 'Castle', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'famous', 'crime', 'novelist', 'fictitious', 'equivalent', 'Stephen', 'King', 'thanks', 'pulling', 'strings', 'mayor', 'office', 'Castle', 'initially', 'there', 'glean', 'ideas', 'inspiration', 'new', 'series', 'female', 'detective', 'named', 'Nikki', 'Heat', 'who', 'based', 'Beckett', 'also', 'clear', 'Castle', '34', 'whodunnit', '34', 'angle', 'solving', 'real-life', 'cases.In', 'addition', 'quickly', 'clear', 'Castle', 'attracted', 'Beckett', 'pretty', 'intelligent', 'yet', 'tough', 'no-nonsense', 'cop', 'writer', 'researcher', 'Castle', 'almost', 'immediately', 'Beckett', 'concluding', 'someone', 'so', 'smart', 'good-looking', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'anything', 'wanted', 'must', 'be', 'specific', 'reason', 'choosing', 'join', 'police', 'force', 'Castle', 'suspicions', 'are', 'fast', 'affirmed', 'also', 'apparent', 'Beckett', 'past', 'too', 'painful', 'discuss', 'Nonetheless', 'hardly', 'deterrent', 'someone', 'Castle', 'who', 'only', 'Beckett', 'more', 'intriguing.Rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'are', 'Kevin', 'Ryan', 'Seamus', 'Dever', 'Javier', 'Esposito', 'Jon', 'Huertas', 'two', 'other', 'NYPD', 'detectives', 'who', 'work', 'Beckett', 'Captain', 'Roy', 'Montgomery', 'Ruben', 'Santiago-Hudson', 'Castle', 'former-actress', 'mother', 'Martha', 'Rodgers', 'Susan', 'Sullivan', 'teen', 'daughter', 'Alexis', 'Molly', 'C.', 'Quinn', 'whom', 'live', 'him.Although', 'Season', '1', 'only', '9', 'episodes', 'great', 'way', 'become', 'introduced', 'quickly', 'addicting', 'series', 'enjoy', 'mysteries', 'bit', 'flirtation', 'frequently', 'sprinkling', 'witty', 'banter', 'humor', 'definitely', 'give', 'Castle', 'try']",Castle: Season 1

It's a fresh idea I haven't seem before even though it is a bit far fetched. The characters interact great with each other and there really aren't any that I dislike. Each episode offers up a fresh murder mystery and Fillion's role as a writer and not a detective gives him a chance to make humorous or quirky comments without seeming out of place. He's a bit of a screwball which he carries off oh so well, and if he were simply a police detective his humor would seem very out of place.

1245239,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B001XRLWPQ,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[2, 3]","In a TV field already clogged with one-hour mystery sitcoms, what Castle adds is a working cop's angle, a blue collar procedural grit.  No necktied PI coming in when the dirty work is already done here.  No, this story centers on a precinct building full of clock-punching police working at uncomfy desks surrounded by sweating cinder blocks.  This is a mystery sitcom that works for a living.In some ways, this show follows the formula.  There's the daffy intruder who upsets everyone's apple cart, the sexual tension probably destined to go unresolved, the compulsory wisecracks, and the slowly unearthed secrets beneath the characters' cool exteriors.  What makes this show great is not that it does anything new, but that it does everything well.The physical design of the show is spectacular.  Breeze-block buildings, alleys, and cracked pavements emphasize just how workaday this world is.  Characters dress with panache, but it's clear that they shop at the mall rather than having a wardrobe team.  Stana Katic is sexy without having to slink, and Nathan Fillion has the manfulness of a guy who doesn't mind a second helping of dessert.  You could imagine walking into this world.And though the murders are elaborate enough that you couldn't imagine this sort of thing really happens that often, they aren't so elevated that they look silly.  The cops have to dig out clues slowly, and often have to let the title character break rules for them if they hope to get to the bottom of the case.  Once again, the procedural angle emphasizes that fighting crime is work, not constant clam.As much as I've enjoyed this series, I must warn you that the special features are mostly lame.  I enjoy the episode commentary, and the commentators offer insights into how an episodic crime comedy is made.  But the short featurettes on Disc 3 were obviously done up by the design team to have something to stick on the DVD.  Skip the special features.Though this is a short run on a midseason replacement, it's a slick, funny, engaging dramedy that will draw in a diverse audience.  Smart and playful, charming and tense, this is what more mystery sitcoms ought to be.

Nathan Fillion plays Richard Castle, crime novelist par excellence, who, in his search for new material, gets himself permanently attached (practically at the hip) to NYPD Detective Kate Becket (Stana Katic); in true Holmes and Watson mode, they go around solving crimes.Castle, with his mystery writer's background, often contributes mightily to the crime solving, AND he makes Becket famous as ""Nikki Heat,"" his latest literary creation.Becket's of two minds about this. At first, she resents having to sheepdog Castle, but as the first season progresses they bond. She also enjoys her notoriety as Nikki Heat, but it sometimes becomes a burden. Her superiors expect her to close every case she gets. She becomes a folk hero to Castle's fans, and a target to the lunatic fringe. Katic, running armed down an alleyway in black jeans is why they invented DVR!Castle, for his part, enjoys the sleuthing, and its obvious he loves both the character of Nikki Heat and her inspiration, whom he very much also admires. Although Castle the bestselling author is sometimes impenetrable to others, he is a warm, funny man who loves his High School-aged daughter and his in-residence mother.The handsome Fillion and the beautiful Katic have a wonderful chemistry onscreen, and I hope this New York-based show lasts many seasons, especially since those NBC boneheads decided to tank LAW & ORDER. The only real downside to CASTLE is that it is a near-clone of BONES, another of my favorite few shows (HOUSE is the third; the rest are in re-runs).Hopefully, the viewership won't tire of two intelligently-written shows brimming with drama and humor, fueled by the sexual tension in a smart, witty partnership between two good-looking people, one male and one female.

Castle is truly a good spirited, kind-hearted almost rustic romantic with an incredibly human side. He is a very compassionate father and the victimized son of a long-term 'dedicated' actress mother. Besides writing murder mystery novels his new kick is trying not to be irritating - but often is - to Kate Beckett (Stana Katic), the NYPD detective. His inspiration for his next set of novels is Det. Becket. The chemistry between Fillion and Katic is eletric and humorous and defiantely organic. It was the charm of Murder She Wrote with the humor of Lou Grant meets House. Unlike most criminal investigation shows, Castle focuses on the story of the murder. The twist after twist after twist. What's really cool is the murderer is literally NEVER who you think it is. Great cast, great writing and just a lot of fun.The bonus materials include the behind the scenes interviews with the stars, out takes, deleted scenes, and more.This is a great family show. Fresh and fun adn has several of the producers from Star Trek: The Next Generation. So the writing is intelligent and thoughtful. A must for every fan of murder mystery television.  Lorenzo M.

While he struggles with writer's block creating a new lead, someone starts using his books as the basis of a series of grisly murders.  When he's called in to consult on the case, he meets NY homicide detective Kate Beckett (Stana Katic).  Beckett is less than impressed with the always joking Castle, but the two do make a decent team tracking down the killer.Beckett also sparks Castle.  In an effort to see her more often, Castle bases his new character on her.  Now he's a regular consultant with the police department, riding along with Beckett and helping her solve crimes.  Will the pairing work out?I must admit, this show snuck up on me, but I really enjoy it.  True, the mysteries are rather formulaic, drawing much from the writings of best selling authors.  I often have the solution figured out before Castle and Beckett, but there's often one twist that throws me along the way.What makes the show so fun are the characters.  Castle and Beckett don't exactly have an adversarial relationship, but she doesn't like having him shadowing her everywhere, either.  They are constantly teasing each other with quips that make it lots of fun.  Yep, another chance to get some laughs along with your mystery.  Additionally, Castle's teenage daughter and mother are living with him.  They really add to the texture of the show.  I just love their scenes.About the only thing that doesn't work is the romantic ""tension.""  I know from what I've read, this is supposed to be part romance as well.  I'm just not buying it.  I see their relationship, at least as we've seen it so far, as more brother and sister than boyfriend and girlfriend.

Long form: I've noticed that most of the ""glowing"" reviews for this ABC show have come from women - who are clearly quite infatuated with the male lead - but I'm sure there are lots of guys out there, who like me, also love the show...and who (also like me) haven't failed to notice the considerable charms of the female lead! (She had a brief part in the most recent James Bond film  - playing an agent who is being duped in the same way as Bond's girlfriend in the previous film.)  In any case, the two of them seem to have that genuine and increasingly rare screen chemistry that makes it fun watching their relationship grow; and Castle's daughter (an incredibly well-adjusted ""normal"" kid) and his mother, who live together with him, along with the two other homicide detectives, their captain, the female M.E., and assorted others, round out a great cast. Castle's fame and wealth have allowed him to be something of a lothario; however since meeting Beckett, apparently a reformed one - so now he's just your basic adult Peter Pan with a knack for knocking out hugely popular mystery novels, and yet still a caring, involved dad - who is able to afford great toys, by the way. Beckett is a slightly repressed (with good reason, we've learned) yet sexy and incredibly focused detective, and don't ask me how, but the two balance each other out perfectly. Anyway, rent or buy the first season if you missed it, and get ready for the upcoming (I hope) second season...when we left them last summer, Castle was just about to risk forever alienating Beckett, by telling her some critical information about her mother's death, a subject she'd warned him to avoid under threat of ending their budding friendship, but that he feels she has to hear to ever have closure...so stay tuned!",5,"Give this show 3 weeks, and you'll be hooked!",1250812800,"08 21, 2009",2009,1881,"['Short', 'version', 'great', 'show', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'do', 'favor', 'watch', 'Long', 'form', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'most', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'ABC', 'show', 'have', 'come', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'clearly', 'quite', 'infatuated', 'male', 'lead', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'lots', 'guys', 'there', 'who', 'also', 'love', 'show', 'who', 'also', 'have', ""n't"", 'failed', 'notice', 'considerable', 'charms', 'female', 'lead', 'had', 'brief', 'part', 'most', 'recent', 'James', 'Bond', 'film', 'playing', 'agent', 'who', 'being', 'duped', 'same', 'way', 'Bond', 'girlfriend', 'previous', 'film', 'case', 'two', 'seem', 'have', 'genuine', 'increasingly', 'rare', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'fun', 'watching', 'relationship', 'grow', 'Castle', 'daughter', 'incredibly', 'well-adjusted', 'normal', 'kid', 'mother', 'who', 'live', 'together', 'two', 'other', 'homicide', 'detectives', 'captain', 'female', 'M.E.', 'assorted', 'others', 'round', 'out', 'great', 'cast', 'Castle', 'fame', 'wealth', 'have', 'allowed', 'be', 'something', 'lothario', 'however', 'meeting', 'Beckett', 'apparently', 'reformed', 'one', 'so', 'now', 'just', 'basic', 'adult', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'knack', 'knocking', 'out', 'hugely', 'popular', 'mystery', 'novels', 'yet', 'still', 'caring', 'involved', 'dad', 'who', 'able', 'afford', 'great', 'toys', 'way', 'Beckett', 'slightly', 'repressed', 'good', 'reason', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'yet', 'sexy', 'incredibly', 'focused', 'detective', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'how', 'two', 'balance', 'other', 'out', 'perfectly', 'Anyway', 'rent', 'buy', 'first', 'season', 'missed', 'get', 'ready', 'upcoming', 'hope', 'second', 'season', 'when', 'left', 'last', 'summer', 'Castle', 'was', 'just', 'about', 'risk', 'forever', 'alienating', 'Beckett', 'telling', 'critical', 'information', 'mother', 'death', 'subject', ""'d"", 'warned', 'avoid', 'threat', 'ending', 'budding', 'friendship', 'hear', 'ever', 'have', 'closure', 'so', 'stay', 'tuned']",Castle: Season 1

Emery,"[1, 1]","I have long been a Nathan Fillion fan, ever since his stint as Caleb on ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" and of course as Mal on Firefly & Serenity.So I was already set to like CASTLE.Not only do I absolutely LOVE this show, it rates as one of only 5 shows I bother to buy on DVD when released.An immature crime novelist paired with a ""just the facts, ma'am"" type of police detective. It's an oddball pairing that just flows so naturally and enjoyably in my opinion.Nathan as Richard Castle is pure comedic genius! His arrogance is laced with a kind of ""playboy"" charm that makes the character impossible not to like.Then there's Stana Katic who plays detective, Kate Beckett. The character is tough and smart, yet shows just enough sensitivity and heart to prevent her from being just some jaded (b)itch.The obvious chemistry the characters feels for each other is actually done believably. Castle is kind of blatent in his attraction toward her, while Beckett is more coy and playful about it.But what REALLY impresses me is how the stories don't feel like ""Eh, they did that kind of episode on this OTHER show before."" The writers do a great job of taking what would normally be a ""been there, done that"" storyline, and they make it actually feel like I've never seen that kind of story before.The only bad thing I can say about this show isn't even ABOUT the show, but rather about the network. There are only 12 episodes in this first season, so you're only getting a little more than half of what you'd buy from a typical season's DVDs.Also, while I loved the special features, they were very minimal. The best one is when Nathan Fillion spends a day with Stephen J. Cannell on how to portray a writer. Hilarious moments from both men!If you're a Nathan Fillion fan, this is a no-brainer: Buy this DVD set.For the rest of the people reading this, all I can say is this: If you want to watch a well written drama for a change, that has some of the best comedy laced though it, this will DEFINITELY be worth buying!That's My Opinion, But You're Welcome To It!",5,Short But SWEET!!,1260316800,"12 9, 2009",2009,2057,"['have', 'long', 'been', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'fan', 'ever', 'stint', 'Caleb', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'course', 'Mal', 'Firefly', 'Serenity.So', 'was', 'already', 'set', 'like', 'CASTLE.Not', 'only', 'do', 'absolutely', 'LOVE', 'show', 'rates', 'one', 'only', '5', 'shows', 'bother', 'buy', 'DVD', 'when', 'released.An', 'immature', 'crime', 'novelist', 'paired', 'just', 'facts', ""ma'am"", 'type', 'police', 'detective', 'oddball', 'pairing', 'just', 'so', 'naturally', 'enjoyably', 'opinion.Nathan', 'Richard', 'Castle', 'pure', 'comedic', 'genius', 'arrogance', 'laced', 'kind', 'playboy', 'charm', 'character', 'impossible', 'not', 'like.Then', 'Stana', 'Katic', 'who', 'detective', 'Kate', 'Beckett', 'character', 'tough', 'smart', 'yet', 'just', 'enough', 'sensitivity', 'heart', 'prevent', 'being', 'just', 'jaded', 'b', 'itch.The', 'obvious', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'feels', 'other', 'actually', 'done', 'believably', 'Castle', 'kind', 'blatent', 'attraction', 'Beckett', 'more', 'coy', 'playful', 'it.But', 'what', 'REALLY', 'how', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Eh', 'did', 'kind', 'episode', 'OTHER', 'show', 'writers', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'taking', 'what', 'would', 'normally', 'be', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'storyline', 'make', 'actually', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'kind', 'story', 'before.The', 'only', 'bad', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'show', ""n't"", 'even', 'show', 'rather', 'network', 'are', 'only', '12', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', ""'re"", 'only', 'getting', 'little', 'more', 'half', 'what', ""'d"", 'buy', 'typical', 'season', 'DVDs.Also', 'loved', 'special', 'features', 'were', 'very', 'minimal', 'best', 'one', 'when', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'day', 'Stephen', 'J.', 'Cannell', 'how', 'portray', 'writer', 'Hilarious', 'moments', 'men', ""'re"", 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'fan', 'no-brainer', 'Buy', 'DVD', 'set.For', 'rest', 'people', 'reading', 'can', 'say', 'want', 'watch', 'well', 'written', 'drama', 'change', 'best', 'comedy', 'laced', 'will', 'DEFINITELY', 'be', 'worth', 'buying', 'My', 'Opinion', ""'re"", 'Welcome']",Castle: Season 1
1245274,A1WX42M589VAMQ,B001XRLWPQ,Mir,"[81, 94]","I'll freely admit that the reason I watched the premiere of Castle (and every episode since) is because Nathan ""Captain Mal"" Fillion is in it. Love the man. LOOOOVE him. He was pitch perfect as the futuristic dashing spaceship captain, a hoot in Dr. Horrible's, and he's got an incredible comedic ability blended with good acting chops and toothsome looks. He's great.So, finally, we see him get top dog billing on a prime time show on one of networks. He's Rick Castle, a bestselling author who is drawn into a partnership (of sorts) with police detective Kate Beckett played by Stana Katic when murders by a serial killer are based on Castle's novels. She's the reluctant partner, he's having a grand old time (with lots of humor), needling her while also being insightful and helpful due to his myriad connections. (I do enjoy how, as the show progresses, we see how he puts that celebrity of his to good use.) That's the core of the show, the conflict and chemistry between the cop and the writer.It works because of Fillion's immense personal charm, humor, and snap-crackliness. Stana is fine in her semi-tense, driven, cop-girl who doesn't eat enough way, but the show is Nathan's.It was nice to see Susan Sullivan of Dharma and Greg fame again, this time as flamboyant mom--oh, those bright outfits, that hair--to Castle. She's good in anything, frankly. We also have a cute if way, way, way too sweet-and-nice daughter to Castle. (Pulease, I haven't met a teen this squeaky nice since Sunday School decades ago. Given grandma's dramatics and dad's wicked sense of humor, where did she come from?)The scenes of daughter and dad tend to be really squishily heartwarming, and that's okay with me. Sometimes, I need that sentimental dose.The supporting cop cast adds to the fun--watch them enjoy their espresso in the episode where Castle springs for one for the crew.Whether Katic will be able to keep up is my main worry. She is doing okay, and there are moments when you're glad she's the crankier one, ""straight man."" But this show will rise or fall on not just Fillion's talent and charisma--and yes, hottienss--but on whether she can really ramp it up and keep the core hot.If you like a less serious cop show, and you are a fan of Fillion's, you've gotta watch/get CASTLE.",5,"Nathan Fillion is Amazingly Good, and yeah, the rest of cast and show are fun, too!",1238630400,"04 2, 2009",2009,2283,"[""'ll"", 'freely', 'admit', 'reason', 'watched', 'premiere', 'Castle', 'episode', 'Nathan', 'Captain', 'Mal', 'Fillion', 'Love', 'man', 'LOOOOVE', 'was', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'futuristic', 'dashing', 'spaceship', 'captain', 'hoot', 'Dr.', 'Horrible', 'got', 'incredible', 'comedic', 'ability', 'blended', 'good', 'acting', 'chops', 'toothsome', 'looks', 'great.So', 'finally', 'see', 'get', 'top', 'dog', 'billing', 'prime', 'time', 'show', 'one', 'networks', 'Rick', 'Castle', 'bestselling', 'author', 'who', 'drawn', 'partnership', 'sorts', 'police', 'detective', 'Kate', 'Beckett', 'played', 'Stana', 'Katic', 'when', 'murders', 'serial', 'killer', 'are', 'based', 'Castle', 'novels', 'reluctant', 'partner', 'having', 'grand', 'old', 'time', 'lots', 'humor', 'needling', 'while', 'also', 'being', 'insightful', 'helpful', 'due', 'myriad', 'connections', 'do', 'enjoy', 'how', 'show', 'see', 'how', 'celebrity', 'good', 'use', 'core', 'show', 'conflict', 'chemistry', 'cop', 'writer.It', 'Fillion', 'immense', 'personal', 'charm', 'humor', 'snap-crackliness', 'Stana', 'fine', 'semi-tense', 'driven', 'cop-girl', 'who', ""n't"", 'eat', 'enough', 'way', 'show', ""Nathan's.It"", 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Susan', 'Sullivan', 'Dharma', 'Greg', 'fame', 'again', 'time', 'flamboyant', 'mom', 'oh', 'bright', 'outfits', 'hair', 'Castle', 'good', 'anything', 'frankly', 'also', 'have', 'cute', 'way', 'way', 'way', 'too', 'sweet-and-nice', 'daughter', 'Castle', 'Pulease', 'have', ""n't"", 'met', 'teen', 'squeaky', 'nice', 'Sunday', 'School', 'decades', 'ago', 'Given', 'grandma', 'dramatics', 'dad', 'wicked', 'sense', 'humor', 'where', 'did', 'come', 'scenes', 'daughter', 'dad', 'tend', 'be', 'really', 'squishily', 'heartwarming', 'okay', 'Sometimes', 'need', 'sentimental', 'dose.The', 'supporting', 'cop', 'cast', 'fun', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'espresso', 'episode', 'where', 'Castle', 'one', 'crew.Whether', 'Katic', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'keep', 'up', 'main', 'worry', 'doing', 'okay', 'are', 'moments', 'when', ""'re"", 'glad', 'crankier', 'one', 'straight', 'man', 'show', 'will', 'rise', 'fall', 'not', 'just', 'Fillion', 'talent', 'charisma', 'yes', 'hottienss', 'can', 'really', 'ramp', 'up', 'keep', 'core', 'hot.If', 'less', 'serious', 'cop', 'show', 'are', 'fan', 'Fillion', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'watch/get', 'CASTLE']",Castle: Season 1

There are 10 wonderful episodes...the pilot episode is sure to get any neophyte hooked on Castle. Anyone who is a fan of great writing will love this show and should buy this DVD set: there is humour, there is drama and so much more than can be put into words...except if you're a Castle writer! It's easy to enjoy over and over again...which after all is why you buy DVDs!I must make mention of the excellent cast, Nathan Fillion, Stana Katic (her first name rhymes with banana! See her website if you don't believe me), Susan Sullivan, Molly Quinn, Jon Huertas, Tamala Jones, Seamus Dever, and Ruben Santiago-Hudson are all impressive and believable in their roles from the beginning, and make this TV show a certifiable classic. There is a very real chemistry between the leads that is exciting and fresh, but there's also a connection within the entire cast which makes watching them so enjoyable.Because this first season is short, one may feel cheated but the bonus features more than make up for any perceived lack. Anyone who's a fan of Stephen J. Cannell must definitely get this for completion! R.I.P. SJC. :(""Castle"" doffs its hat to the greats of history, naming the lead female detective who is completely efficient and strikingly beautiful after the first female detective in the US, Kate (Warne), and having amazing story lines that also pay homage to other fascinating characters in the history of crime fiction. Awesomeness!In Season 1, there are several amazing guest stars, Patrick Bauchau (Carnivale -HBO; The Pretender -NBC/TNT), Caterina Scorsone (Private Practice -ABC; Missing -Lifetime); Jason Brooks (Days of Our Lives, The Pretender), Judy Reyes - of the original ""Little Girl Lost: the Delimar Vera Story"" (Lifetime movie), plus the real-life authors whom Castle hobnobs with at his poker table: James Patterson, Stephen J. Cannell et al.Definitely worth buying and especially at the low low price Amazon is giving it away for these days - $16.99!Or you could try to save the earth and get it through Instant video...if you're in the US that is.

1245278,A1YOYEB5K3XFTU,B001XRLWPQ,"MovieLover ""movieloversyd""","[0, 0]","Can't believe I've been missing out on this wonderful show. I know it's now been on for 6 seasons, so I have no idea why it took me so long to discover a great show that so many others were watching regularly. Hey, better late than never though. I'm not even sure when exactly or why exactly I began to watch this series, but I believe it may have been the fact that it's on a marathon run almost every day of the week. Hey, that's what originally captured my attention with the Law and Order spin-offs. Oh, maybe that's the reason it took me so long - i.e. because I was already watching so many other detective shows and didn't realize just how 'different' and 'unique' this one was. Whatever the reason, I'm so glad to finally be a regular viewer.While I've been a fan of Law and Order Criminal Intent, Law and Order SVU, CSI New York ... and occasionally CSI Miami ... I really don't want to compare ""CASTLE"" to any of the above. In fact, other than being a detective series, it really has little in common with those other shows. n actuality it's probably a lot more similar to an oldie but goodie ~ ""Moonlighting."" That said, I think it's actually more entertaining than it's so-called predecessor. For one thing, the relationship between Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic is engaging, entertaining, comical, sweet (at times) and even believable. O.K., so the concept of a mayor allowing a well-known writer to tag along with a detective may not be very realistic .... but the chemistry between these two characters (and actors) definitely is. The other regular characters are equally satisfying to watch. Some shows just get their casting right, while others .... not so much; this one did get it right. I love the relationship between Castle and his family as much as the one he has with Beckett and the other detectives. Either Nathan is a really charming guy in reality, or he sure knows how to play one. I suspect both are true. What he brings to this role, besides comedic relief to intense situations revolving around homicides, is an honest portrayal of someone who is genuinely concerned about the cases he's allowed to be a part of. Uh....not to mention his genuine interest in Detective Beckett. As the series progresses, Castle gradually grows on Beckett .... initially annoying the you-know-what out of her, and eventually becoming her friend, co-worker, confidant and love interest. Detective Beckett is equally engaging to watch and her devotion to her career, based on personal past history, is real and believable.I have some catching up to do as I have not seen every single episode as yet. However, I've seen the early episodes several times and found the decision to finally begin my DVD series collection to be a 'no brainer.' For other newcomers like myself, if you are hooked on season one, as I was and still am, then it's likely you will continue to watch the other seasons. I'm hoping to purchase season 2 soon .... and plan to gradually add all the seasons to my DVD collection.

1245279,AOAUIFXP0UMWO,B001XRLWPQ,mrobinson52,"[6, 6]","The only reason I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 is that the first season was a mid-season replacement, with only 10 episodes, and it did not start as strong as it is in the current second season. There is much to like about this show. The family scenes really humanize the main character, who would be a bit of a jerk otherwise. His relationship with his daughter is one of the best on tv currently.I really like the fact that this series does not fall into the problem most mysteries have had in the past, such as Murder, She Wrote. There is a reason this non-professional is involved in the crime solving rather than having people get murdered wherever he goes. Also, the victims are interesting, because at first you do not really care that much about them, but as you learn more, you gain more sympathy for them and start to really want the killer to be caught. This is also different from some mysteries where the victim is someone you could picture as having many enemies so there would be more suspects.The writing is good, and the acting is great, as you really come to see these characters as real people. I hope the series continues for a long time to come, as long as they keep the quality up.

""Castle"" is a plain out overall fun murder mystery show. Everything from the actors (the always underrated Nathan Fillion and the always lovely Stana Katic), the murders and the dialogue are fresh. I am not saying fresh in the sense that the series has re-invented the wheel, but fresh compared to over serious and seriously OVER/DONE/CANCEL ALREADY crime shows out there like ""CSI"", ""NCSI"" and ""Law & Order"" (all spin offs included). The thing that works for this show is the humor combined with the dialogue and the playful chemistry of the stars. It almost reminds me of the playful nature of ""Ellery Queen"" (thanks to re-runs on A&E; I can reference that), ""Nero Wolfe"" or even earlier ""Murder, She Wrote"" episodes.Bottom line the series is a good time that helps you take your mind off of the real world around you and to me that is good solid entertainment.The DVD set has your standard transfer. Everything looks good, at least for me I have not seen anything wrong.  The audio when piped through a surround sound system is all there (like I said standard stuff). I honestly can say if there is one complaint I have with anything here it is the opening DVD menu. Being a Graphic Designer, I just feel that the title should fade in like it does, the pen should come in on the A, title fades out and menu commands come up. Instead the pen shows up on the left and stay, the title is just in and out with no pen motion and the menu commands come up. I am using this as an example of how I find nothing wrong with this set at all and need at least one thing to complain about.I feel that this will be an excellent addition to any crime show/murder mystery fan or someone who is just looking for a fun show to watch.",5,Castle: Season One Review,1259280000,"11 27, 2009",2009,1885,"['nothing', 'much', 'say', 'not', 'been', 'covered', 'other', 'reviews', 'product', 'summary', 'Amazon', 'even', 'TV', 'Guide', 'entertainment', 'guide', 'review', 'Castle', 'plain', 'overall', 'fun', 'murder', 'mystery', 'show', 'Everything', 'actors', 'always', 'underrated', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'always', 'lovely', 'Stana', 'Katic', 'murders', 'dialogue', 'are', 'fresh', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'fresh', 'sense', 'series', 're-invented', 'wheel', 'fresh', 'compared', 'serious', 'seriously', 'OVER/DONE/CANCEL', 'ALREADY', 'crime', 'out', 'there', 'CSI', 'NCSI', 'Law', 'Order', 'spin', 'offs', 'included', 'thing', 'show', 'humor', 'combined', 'dialogue', 'playful', 'chemistry', 'stars', 'almost', 'playful', 'nature', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'thanks', 're-runs', 'A', 'E', 'can', 'reference', 'Nero', 'Wolfe', 'even', 'earlier', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'episodes.Bottom', 'line', 'series', 'good', 'time', 'take', 'mind', 'real', 'world', 'good', 'solid', 'entertainment.The', 'DVD', 'set', 'standard', 'transfer', 'Everything', 'good', 'least', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'anything', 'wrong', 'audio', 'when', 'piped', 'surround', 'sound', 'system', 'there', 'said', 'standard', 'stuff', 'honestly', 'can', 'say', 'one', 'complaint', 'have', 'anything', 'here', 'opening', 'DVD', 'menu', 'Being', 'Graphic', 'Designer', 'just', 'feel', 'title', 'should', 'fade', 'pen', 'should', 'come', 'A', 'title', 'fades', 'out', 'menu', 'commands', 'come', 'up', 'Instead', 'pen', 'up', 'left', 'stay', 'title', 'just', 'pen', 'motion', 'menu', 'come', 'up', 'am', 'using', 'example', 'how', 'find', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'set', 'need', 'least', 'one', 'thing', 'complain', 'about.I', 'feel', 'will', 'be', 'excellent', 'addition', 'crime', 'show/murder', 'mystery', 'fan', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'looking', 'fun', 'show', 'watch']",Castle: Season 1

1245302,ANW7ZQSOJQ2A7,B001XRLWPQ,"Richard Muller ""old school audiologist""","[0, 0]","For me, a very bittersweet introduction to some terrific writing and ensemble acting.  The &#34;Goodbye&#34; refers to Steven J. Cannell who passed away not long after doing some guest appearances in Castle's weekly poker game.  He also did some &#34;Bonus features&#34; for this 1st season of a comedy/drama/romance that was obviously close to his heart.  Whatever the amount of influence he might have had was most likely in the writing department, which is where its creator, Andrew W.Marlowe, has excelled.  This series is listed in the TV Guide as a &#34;Comedy&#34;.  But the clever way that drama is woven into the comedy (or vice-versa) makes it even more likable for the viewer.  Plus the interaction of stars Nathan Fillion (Firefly) and lovely Canadian actor Stana Katic (The Librarian #3) is one of the very best on TV these days, PERIOD!  Rick Castle (&#34;Master of the Macabre&#34;) is the well-connected, successful writer whose friendship with the Mayor gets him into the NYPD Precinct for the research he needs for his next series &#8212; after he kills off the &#34;hero&#34; of his wildly successful crime novels.  His first attraction/confrontation with Detective Kate Beckett (Katic) makes for an instant love/hate relationship that develops well over time, making it almost inevitable that the two will eventually be an &#34;item&#34;. The supporting cast of Castle makes this a true ensemble piece, with Seamus Dever and John Huertas doing the gopher work and backing up the lead team wonderfully well.  Mystery Writer Rick Castle's family is no less than absolutely charming and equally as quirky (in some respects) as he is.  Molly Quinn is real heartbreaker as Castle's daughter Alexis, a remarkably well grounded young lady, and veteran actress Susan Sullivan is the Grand Dame of the family, Martha Rogers, and provides the connection that every family needs as Castle's Mother.  The development of the characters is terrific, with the viewer getting more and more insight into what makes Castle &#8212; and the rest of the characters as well &#8212; really tick.  If you remember &#34;Moonlighting&#34; or &#34;The Rockford Files&#34;, you will get very comfortable quickly with Castle.  Did I mention the writing??  One cannot stress enough how well it is done here.  The storylines are varied and equally quirky as some of the characters investigating them.  The City of New York may make this familiar ground for many viewers, and adds to the possibilities of interesting storylines.  This variety of crimes and scoial interaction may be the best thing that has happened to a series on TV for many, many years!  As comfortable as reading a book, you will absolutely find Castle to be a fun evening in front of the Small Screen.  Now in its fifth season, we can only hope that this series has many more to come; as in my mind this is one comedy/drama that is still developing nicely and continues to improve with age.  Fast moving, with great attention to detail, this is something that can be viewed over and over again with a big smile on your face!",5,"""Hello"" to a great ""Whodunit"" series!

However, this year seemed to offer something new and different. ""Castle"" (and ""Revenge"", though unrelated except for both being on ABC) show what writers can create when not constrained by too many stereotypes of what a popular/profitable show should be. Yes, there are legitemate challenges that it is a stereotypical ""ensemble police dramedy.""

I just don't get it.Contrived is the best way to describe it. Predictable. Corny. And it drives me nuts watching any show about the police and the legal system that doesn't follow facts - so many times in each episode what they were doing was just wrong, cops would never do that, or cops aren't *allowed* to do that - whatever. Making up stuff because it fits how you want the story to go - if you are going to have one of your main characters be a detective then why can't they research and do things correctly? Probably because that is rather boring and they want something exciting for the camera.Anyway.
