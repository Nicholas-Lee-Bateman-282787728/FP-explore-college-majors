723790,A1VWDUFE3AX61H,B00007149K,,"[7, 7]","With all due respect to the previous reviewers, I think rating this DVD is a matter of perspective.  If what you are looking for is a video (as opposed to a film) of the concert itself, that is to say, if you want to be able to sit back and feel like you're watching the concert in linear fashion as though you were there, then I agree with the other reveiwers that this DVD is a disappointment.  But if you are seeking a documentary film of the Back in the US tour that includes much of the concert but also includes commentary, crowd shots, interviews, etc., then you will find this DVD very fun to watch.  I agree with the other reviewers that the fast cutting from shot to shot during the performances gets annoying.  I'm sure the editor thought that the fast cuts would add ""energy"" to the film.  Sorry, but it's simply annoying.  I attended the concert, so watching the film brings back happy memories.  But make no mistake about it, this is a documentary film of the tour, not a video of just the concert.  The visual has all the grainy the shortcomings of film versus video, but if that's not a priority for you you'll enjoy the DVD just the same.  So, if you want something that's more of a pure concert video like ""The ""Concert for George"" or ""The Doobie Brothers Live at Wolf Trap"" or ""The Moodie Blues at Red Rocks"", you'll probably be disappointed with ""Back in the US.""  But if you're interested in a documentary film of the tour that happens to include quite a bit of music, then you'll probably enjoy this one.",4,A Matter of Perspective,1111536000,"03 23, 2005",2005,1526,"['due', 'respect', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'think', 'rating', 'DVD', 'matter', 'perspective', 'what', 'are', 'looking', 'video', 'opposed', 'film', 'concert', 'say', 'want', 'be', 'able', 'sit', 'back', 'feel', ""'re"", 'watching', 'concert', 'linear', 'fashion', 'were', 'there', 'then', 'agree', 'other', 'reveiwers', 'DVD', 'disappointment', 'are', 'seeking', 'documentary', 'film', 'Back', 'US', 'tour', 'much', 'concert', 'also', 'commentary', 'crowd', 'shots', 'interviews', 'etc.', 'then', 'will', 'find', 'DVD', 'very', 'fun', 'watch', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'fast', 'cutting', 'shot', 'shot', 'performances', 'annoying', ""'m"", 'sure', 'editor', 'thought', 'fast', 'cuts', 'would', 'add', 'energy', 'film', 'Sorry', 'simply', 'annoying', 'attended', 'concert', 'watching', 'film', 'back', 'happy', 'memories', 'make', 'mistake', 'documentary', 'film', 'tour', 'not', 'video', 'just', 'concert', 'visual', 'grainy', 'shortcomings', 'film', 'versus', 'video', 'not', 'priority', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'just', 'same', 'So', 'want', 'something', 'more', 'pure', 'concert', 'video', 'Concert', 'George', 'Doobie', 'Brothers', 'Live', 'Wolf', 'Trap', 'Moodie', 'Blues', 'Red', 'Rocks', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Back', 'US', ""'re"", 'interested', 'documentary', 'film', 'tour', 'include', 'quite', 'bit', 'music', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'one']",Paul McCartney: Back in the U.S. - Live 2002 Concert Film

Hardcore Paul fans are giving reviews based on seeing him live during his most recent tour. Give me a break already! I look forward to reading reviews from fans who have actually seen the Dvd.Update:11/27/2002, Now that I have viewed this Dvd for the first time, I must say this just might possibly be the best Rock/concert film released this year.  The concert footage sends chills down ones spine as Paul and his band play flawless interpretations of both his Beatle and solo material.  The interaction and response of the audience makes you feel as if you were there.  One can also sense an emotional and loving respect that the audience has for this legend and in someways felt his grief when he sang ""Something"" in honor of George Harrison while playing a ukulele that George gave him as a gift.  His hit ""My Love"" was obviously sang with Linda in mind.  Paul has assembled a band that is without question one of his best ever.  Drummer Abe Laboriel Jr. is a standout here and is something to see.  I would also recommend the companion cd as well.  If you are a Beatle fan or McCartney fan or just like great music, I would advise you to pick up this Paul McCartney concert Dvd and enjoy an evening of fun and music from the man who wrote the soundtrack to many of our lives.",5,Sir Paul at his very best!,1038182400,"11 25, 2002",2002,1377,"['am', 'totally', 'amazed', '16', 'reviews', 'are', 'Dvd', 'even', 'been', 'released', 'public', 'Hardcore', 'Paul', 'fans', 'are', 'giving', 'reviews', 'based', 'seeing', 'live', 'most', 'recent', 'tour', 'Give', 'break', 'already', 'look', 'forward', 'reading', 'reviews', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'actually', 'seen', 'Dvd.Update:11/27/2002', 'Now', 'have', 'viewed', 'Dvd', 'first', 'time', 'must', 'say', 'just', 'might', 'possibly', 'be', 'best', 'Rock/concert', 'film', 'released', 'year', 'concert', 'footage', 'chills', 'down', 'ones', 'spine', 'Paul', 'band', 'play', 'flawless', 'interpretations', 'Beatle', 'solo', 'material', 'interaction', 'response', 'audience', 'feel', 'were', 'there', 'One', 'can', 'also', 'sense', 'emotional', 'loving', 'respect', 'audience', 'legend', 'someways', 'felt', 'grief', 'when', 'sang', 'Something', 'honor', 'George', 'Harrison', 'playing', 'ukulele', 'George', 'gave', 'gift', 'hit', 'Love', 'was', 'obviously', 'sang', 'Linda', 'mind', 'Paul', 'assembled', 'band', 'question', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'Drummer', 'Abe', 'Laboriel', 'Jr.', 'standout', 'here', 'something', 'see', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'companion', 'cd', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'Beatle', 'fan', 'McCartney', 'fan', 'just', 'great', 'music', 'would', 'advise', 'pick', 'up', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'concert', 'Dvd', 'enjoy', 'evening', 'fun', 'music', 'man', 'who', 'wrote', 'soundtrack', 'many', 'lives']",Paul McCartney: Back in the U.S. - Live 2002 Concert Film

When the attacks of September 11th managed to affect everyone the world over, including Sir Paul himself, he knew this tour should be more than just something to sell a new product. Paul used the tour to promote the healing power of music, to ease the pain the Americans were feeling in the wake of tragedy with his music.The tour turned out to be highly successful. To commemorate its success as well as emotional effect, a two disc cd and dvd both entitled ""Back In The U.S."" were released (I wrote my glowing review for the cd when it first came out 4 and a bit years ago).Like the cd, the dvd of ""Back In The U.S."" is an incredible piece of entertainment. In addition to over 30 excellent performances of classics from Paul's Beatles years as well as his solo career, we see Paul interract with his family (the tender moments with Heather seem somewhat cheap now in the wake of recent events, but who cares), his band, his crew, and best of all his fans. We see the reactions of his loving audiene (be on the lookout for, among others, Jack Nicholson, Michael Douglas and other notable celebs enjoying the magic of Sir Paul's music), and it's truly a one of a kind experience.Though it's not quite up to par with Paul's 1991 ""Get Back"", ""Back In The U.S."" is still an excellent representation of Sir Paul in concert and why he is the legend that he is.",5,A Great Performance And Something No American Patriot Should Be Without.,1169337600,"01 21, 2007",2007,1490,"['Paul', 'McCartney', '2002', 'American', 'tour', 'was', 'initially', 'held', 'support', 'album', 'Driving', 'Rain', 'soon', 'grew', 'something', 'more', 'When', 'attacks', 'September', '11th', 'managed', 'affect', 'everyone', 'world', 'including', 'Sir', 'Paul', 'knew', 'tour', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'just', 'something', 'sell', 'new', 'product', 'Paul', 'used', 'tour', 'promote', 'healing', 'power', 'music', 'ease', 'pain', 'Americans', 'were', 'feeling', 'wake', 'tragedy', 'music.The', 'tour', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'highly', 'successful', 'commemorate', 'success', 'as', 'well', 'emotional', 'effect', 'two', 'disc', 'cd', 'dvd', 'entitled', 'Back', 'U.S.', 'were', 'released', 'wrote', 'glowing', 'review', 'cd', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', '4', 'bit', 'years', 'ago', 'cd', 'dvd', 'Back', 'U.S.', 'incredible', 'piece', 'entertainment', 'addition', '30', 'excellent', 'performances', 'classics', 'Paul', 'Beatles', 'years', 'as', 'well', 'solo', 'career', 'see', 'Paul', 'interract', 'family', 'tender', 'moments', 'Heather', 'seem', 'somewhat', 'cheap', 'now', 'wake', 'recent', 'events', 'who', 'band', 'crew', 'best', 'fans', 'see', 'reactions', 'loving', 'audiene', 'be', 'lookout', 'others', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'other', 'notable', 'celebs', 'enjoying', 'magic', 'Sir', 'Paul', 'music', 'truly', 'one', 'kind', 'not', 'quite', 'par', 'Paul', '1991', 'Get', 'Back', 'Back', 'U.S.', 'still', 'excellent', 'representation', 'Sir', 'Paul', 'concert', 'why', 'legend']",Paul McCartney: Back in the U.S. - Live 2002 Concert Film

Obviously, that is a creative decision that Paul, as Executive Producer made - and you have to respect his decision to make something other than a ""pure"" concert film.  I was surprised at this - I expected the non-concert footage to be contained in a separate program.  However, it doesn't really bother me that much.What DOES bother me is the video quality - it looks like grainy VHS - I would rate much of it lower than VHS quality.  This has to have been a conscious decision (there are obviously some interview spots where this was done intentionally) - but why do it during the concert footage?  I understand that film looks ""richer"" than video (i.e. - the quality difference between a movie and a typical three-camera sitcom is enormous) - but richness is not the same as graininenss - I don't know if they shot this in video and then applied some sort of ""fim effect"" or what, but the result is not good.The sound is OK - certainly not the best DTS mix I've ever heard in terms of its use of the rear channels.",3,Content OK - Video Quality Not,1038700800,"12 1, 2002",2002,1260,"['Several', 'reviewers', 'have', 'expressed', 'disappointment', 'content', 'DVD', 'basically', 'not', 'straight', 'concert', 'DVD', 'rather', 'interviews', 'backstage', 'goofing', 'other', 'gobblygook', 'midst', 'show', 'Obviously', 'creative', 'decision', 'Paul', 'Executive', 'Producer', 'made', 'have', 'respect', 'decision', 'make', 'something', 'other', 'pure', 'concert', 'film', 'was', 'surprised', 'expected', 'non-concert', 'footage', 'be', 'contained', 'separate', 'program', 'However', ""n't"", 'really', 'bother', 'much.What', 'DOES', 'bother', 'video', 'quality', 'grainy', 'VHS', 'would', 'rate', 'much', 'lower', 'VHS', 'quality', 'have', 'been', 'conscious', 'decision', 'are', 'obviously', 'interview', 'spots', 'where', 'was', 'done', 'intentionally', 'why', 'do', 'concert', 'footage', 'understand', 'film', 'richer', 'video', 'i.e', 'quality', 'difference', 'movie', 'typical', 'three-camera', 'sitcom', 'enormous', 'richness', 'not', 'same', 'graininenss', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'shot', 'video', 'then', 'applied', 'sort', 'fim', 'effect', 'what', 'result', 'not', 'good.The', 'sound', 'OK', 'certainly', 'not', 'best', 'DTS', 'mix', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'terms', 'use', 'rear', 'channels']",Paul McCartney: Back in the U.S. - Live 2002 Concert Film

Ringo's new All-Starr concert DVD has MUCH higher quality video, and also doesn't have the MTV short attention span edits all through it. I actually had a headache after watching this! That is the same bad editing style that Paul's last two concert tour films used (&quot;Get Back&quot; &amp; &quot;Paul Is Live&quot;) that make them very annoying too, and almost unwatchable. The behind the scenes stuff and excess fan clips should be included as extras, they detract from the show, interupt the flow, and make the feature less watchable after multiple viewings. Who wants to see that stuff more than once or twice, and certainly not in between and over top most every song (they didn't learn from Black Sabbath's &quot;Last Supper&quot; butcher job). In a different way, the same complaint I had with Ringo's DVD--just show the WHOLE concert, in the right order, that's what makes a good concert video--goes here too.The sound is OK, should have been better when other artists release better than this (in addition to previous mentions, I would add Fleetwood Mac &quot;The Dance&quot; as another audio benchmark comparison).The extras, that were included, are nice. The sound check performances are more fun than the feature really. They would have made a killer extra grouped together, and should not have been mixed partly into the concert portion of video. There is nothing on this whole DVD that beats the version of &quot;Matchbox&quot; from the sound check. As for the &quot;bonus Secret Web Site&quot;, what a worthless waste. Some techno-geek's &quot;brilliant idea&quot; of the day. Everything that is on that site should have, and could have, been on this DVD.

His voice was far stronger than his 1990 and 1993 tours, and his young band really made McCartney work harder than he'd done in decades. While not as many surprises in the set list as before, those selected made for a well-paced exciting show.But, this DVD isn't quite as good of a souvenir as those of us who attended the shows would've liked. First off, it might be THE most fawning video of a performer. An artist of his stature hardly needs the gushing validation that this offers, plus all the superstar accolades. And all this fawning takes up time away from the music. Only about 29 of the 35 songs played on the tour are performed in the concert film (another three are in the bonus section), and not all the songs are performed complete. Sadly, his sweet tribute to George Harrison, ""Something"" is trimmed by a whole verse. Surely we could have cut out one more shot of a middle aged soccer mom screaming ""PAUL!""......... to find room for this lovely song complete. Finally, the songs aren't in the order they were played, which is likewise disappointing as it was the pace of the show that was part of its success.As for the disc quality, the authoring of this is really sad, almost like it was done on a home computer. The same footage appeared in the ABC-TV special in far better quality, so this is just a mediocre DVD master. The disc's authors have also put the scene/track selections in the ""Special Features"" section (not exactly where I'd look for them), but you can quick access your favorite song.But on the plus side - it sounds fantastic. The performances chosen from the tour footage are outstanding, both McCartney and band are in terrific form. The bonus materials (soundchecks, backstage, etc.) are generous and will make McCartney fans happy.So...a mixed review. But all the details aside - it IS a great show that I know I'll enjoy often.",3,Great Performance on a so-so DVD,1038441600,"11 28, 2002",2002,1961,"['question', 'Paul', 'McCartney', '2002', 'tour', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'post-Beatles', 'performances', 'voice', 'was', 'far', 'stronger', '1990', '1993', 'tours', 'young', 'band', 'really', 'made', 'McCartney', 'work', 'harder', ""'d"", 'done', 'decades', 'not', 'many', 'surprises', 'set', 'list', 'before', 'selected', 'made', 'well-paced', 'exciting', 'show.But', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'souvenir', 'who', 'attended', 'shows', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'First', 'might', 'be', 'THE', 'most', 'fawning', 'video', 'performer', 'artist', 'stature', 'hardly', 'gushing', 'validation', 'superstar', 'accolades', 'fawning', 'up', 'time', 'away', 'music', 'Only', '29', '35', 'songs', 'played', 'tour', 'are', 'performed', 'concert', 'film', 'three', 'are', 'bonus', 'section', 'not', 'songs', 'are', 'performed', 'complete', 'Sadly', 'sweet', 'tribute', 'George', 'Harrison', 'Something', 'trimmed', 'whole', 'verse', 'Surely', 'could', 'have', 'cut', 'out', 'one', 'more', 'shot', 'middle', 'aged', 'soccer', 'mom', 'screaming', 'PAUL', 'find', 'room', 'lovely', 'song', 'complete', 'Finally', 'songs', 'are', ""n't"", 'order', 'were', 'played', 'likewise', 'disappointing', 'was', 'pace', 'show', 'was', 'part', 'success.As', 'disc', 'quality', 'authoring', 'really', 'sad', 'almost', 'was', 'done', 'home', 'computer', 'same', 'footage', 'appeared', 'ABC-TV', 'special', 'far', 'better', 'quality', 'just', 'mediocre', 'DVD', 'master', 'disc', 'authors', 'have', 'also', 'put', 'scene/track', 'selections', 'Special', 'Features', 'section', 'not', 'exactly', 'where', ""'d"", 'look', 'can', 'quick', 'access', 'favorite', 'song.But', 'plus', 'side', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'chosen', 'tour', 'footage', 'are', 'outstanding', 'McCartney', 'band', 'are', 'terrific', 'form', 'bonus', 'materials', 'soundchecks', 'backstage', 'etc', 'are', 'generous', 'will', 'make', 'McCartney', 'fans', 'happy.So', 'mixed', 'review', 'details', 'aside', 'great', 'show', 'know', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'often']",Paul McCartney: Back in the U.S. - Live 2002 Concert Film

There was my near life-long hero, joining an out of key Terry Bradshaw for a rendition of Love Me Do.  At that moment, I saw McCartney as an over the hill, egomanical opportunist.  I honestly believed, at that time, that he used 9-11 as his own promotional tool.Well, hell, McCartney has always been unabashedly self-promoting.  But at his age, I guess it just didn't go down quite as easily.  Thank God, this DVD nearly erases that Super Bowl blunder.  McCartney is sincere, energetic and puts on a hell of a show.  He's made some good and bad decisions in his career; getting some younger guys for Driving Rain and this tour was definitely a good decision.  These guys give him a badly needed adreniline shot, as their energy is contagious.  None more so than drummer Abe, a rather large young black man.  While subtlety is not his forte, and is missed a few times, he bashes the drums with an abandon I've not seen since Keith Moon.  The two young guitarists add to the inspired mayhem, and it's a good thing we've got good old Wix Wickham to hold everything together.This DVD is a must have if you're a McCartney fan.  These are energized versions of mostly very old Macca songs, and you'll just love the electricity the band, and the old man, create onstage.The sound itself is a bit of a bummer.  Producer David Kahne obviously wanted to capture the energy that was happening onstage, but he does it at the expense of any real detail.  You feel like you are in the arena, kind of lost in that big sound.  I guess that's a good thing, but sometimes individual sounds are all but lost in that big sound.On this tour, Macca makes up for his aging voice with pure energy and will.  Again, the subtlety and suppleness of his young voice is gone, but he sings his heart out, and God love him for it.Enough said.

To tell you the truth that was one of my two biggest disappointments.  Concert DVD's should all be in WIDESCREEN ANAMORPHIC format. THERE IS NO EXCUSE.

Paul McCartney, one of rock and roll's true greats, broke records with his 2002 nation-wide tour.  Indeed, one wonders where Paul gets the energy to perform virtually nonstop for two and a half hours during each show.  Therefore, my review of this DVD is somewhat jaded by the fantastic experience of attending Paul's Philadelphia concert.The DVD does not fully convey the spirit of the concert.  As a tour documentary intercut with live concert footage, it is a well edited film.  As a pure McCartney concert it somewhat misses the mark.  Unfortunately several of the musical numbers are cut short with the addition of tour commentary.  There are breaks between the numbers to interview crowds, show footage of the tour driving cross country, and other non-performance vignettes.Some of the songs are not included in the main presentation and can only be found in the bonus material.  This DVD would probably have been better off as a pure -- unbroken --  concert DVD with a bonus disc highlighting the other aspects of the tour.  No doubt the editing of the DVD was designed to distinguish it from the companion CD of the same tour.On the plus side for all those who viewed the ABC Television special BACK IN THE U.S., this DVD has double the material that was broadcast on national television.

Don't get me wrong, the 2002 band was probably the best of McCartney's solo career, and there is much evidence of that on this release. No, the problem is not with the music, but rather McCartney's presentation of it, and his own on-stage routine. I went to all three shows in Boston on the 2002 tour, and by the third I literally could not wait for it to end. Each show had the same tedious jokes, phony forgotten words, hokey George Harrison tribute, and worst of all, the endless ""solo"" applause for McCartney. I'm sure he could have squeezed at least a couple more numbers into the set if he hadn't spent so much time standing in the spotlight, arms aloft, wallowing in the adulation. Save for a couple of set changes between the April and September shows, the whole thing was scripted to a word, and acted as such. Given this then, it is no wonder that the DVD record of the tour should reflect a similar disregard for the spontaneity of rock music. Instead of showing the concert as performed, we are ""treated"" to songs interspersed with more of the McCartney adulation routine; endless one-liners from adoring fans, a slew of shots of audience members waving ""I love you Paul"" signs, a short clip of Jack Nicholson, or some other celeb, grooving along in some VIP box. You get the idea.It was revealing that around the same time as the release of the tour DVD and CD the whole ""Lennon-McCartney"" thing broke in the news, when Macca locked horns with Yoko Ono over his insistence on reversing the most famous song writing credits in music history to suit his own purposes. What really disturbs me is that there is just no need for McCartney to do all of this. Is he really that insecure? If so, perhaps this explains his inability to perform a real, spontaneous rock and roll show, or release a visual record that doesn't spend most of its time trying to show just how revered the star of the show is.

I was looking forward to being able to own this as a souvenir of the concert experience. Unfortunately, it 'Back In The US' turned out to be a complete disappointment.What ruined it for me was all the jumpy camera work, constant scene editting, song truncations, backstage shots mixed in with song performances, etc, etc, etc.  And there was way too much focus on audience shots, it all just seemed too contrived and artificial. Which is was a real let-down, because I was really hoping for this DVD to be a simple film of  uninterupted concert songs in sequence so I could experience it as a souvenir of the show I saw.No, it's not completely terrible. The sound is great, and the picture quality is clear and sharp. And of course the music is absolutely wonderful. But what else would you expect with Beatles music.I just wanted to watch the band play songs in sequence without the constant interuptions and dizzying camera work. All the crowd scenes, backstage shots, etc, etc, would have been better featured on a bonus disk. Continually mixed in with the band's performance is distracting and ultimately annoying.Jan 15,2003 lr***(I am definitely passing on this DVD.

In addition, Paul has completely come to terms with his past.  In addition to performing many Beatles songs, he dedicates ""Here Today"" to John Lennon, ""Something"" to George Harrison and ""My Love"" to Linda McCartney.  However, don't get the impression that the concerts are somber remembrances of past glories.  All of the songs, old and new, are performed with passion, vitality and a sense of fun.

723836,ARMVMKO557G3V,B00007149K,PETER XUEREB,"[1, 2]","Firstly I can't get over the number of mixed reviews here for this DVD. Talk about polarised opinions. It's obvious those who were at the concerts last year expected similar a treatement on this DVD. Whereas the ""fan"" opinion is opposite. I last saw Paul in concert in 1993 here in Sydney and it was the fulfillment of a dream seeing one of my childhood heroes in concert in the flesh.  Personally I enjoyed the DVD speaking as someone who didn't get to see him on this tour as he didn't make it down to Oz this time around. The ""interuptions"" were OK. I can relate to the comments made by the fans at the concerts..the music touched and still touches us deeply. Let's face it the man is an entertainer first and foremost. Yeah there were a couple of cheesy moments - the zoo apes particularly and it cut into ""Hey Jude"".  The song ""Freedom"" ""may have helped New Yorkers get over 9/11"" but it does come across a little too gung-ho and he's a pommy! (Bruce Springsteen's recent CD ""The Rising"" was probably the best example of how to approach this tragedy musically in a very intelligent, thoughful and non-jingoistic way). The behind scenes stuff puts things in perspective. The audience reactions to the ""Live And Let Die"" pyros reminded me of my own back in '93. But this is more a rock-umentary than a concert and if one approaches the DVD this way then it can be a very enjoyable experience. It's touching watching Paul's emotional reaction to his crew's ""last night heart surprise"" during ""Long & Winding Road"". Yeah he might have an ego but he's a guy that obviously tries to look after his own and his crews actions reflected that. When I heard Paul's ukelele version of ""Something"" on the CD I was a tad disappointed and annoyed by his approach as a tribute to George. However on the DVD he explains before the song that George was a great ukelele player. Now I understand the nature of the tribute. I'm no longer annoyed & disappointed but I would like to hear a more ""serious rendition"" of it  all the same Paul. He is backed by a great, cracking young band of musicians who are all obviously thrilled at being on the same stage as Sir Paul McCartney. Heck I'm an ex-drummer and I would be ecstatic at such a chance. It's typical of the standard of musicians that Paul has always surrounded himself with going back to the Beatles then Wings and his other touring bands in the 80's & 90's through to the guys he used on his ""Cavern"" concert and ""Run Devil Run"" album.The concert performances are superb. While it may have been great to see the concert from go to whoa for myself I don't mind the approach of this DVD as I find it a little difficult to sit through a whole concert video in one sitting.

The cd is a superb account of  Mr. McCartney's most recent American tour and really captured the essence of the concert.  The dvd doesn't quite match up to the album.  The concert footage and performances are exactly the same, so of course, they are excellent.  The problem lies in the editing.  There is a bit too movement, cutting from one band member, to the audience and so forth, that the pace is too quick.  Also, an even bigger problem is the breaking away from the concert to see backstage footage, on the road footage, etc.  While these, unto themselves are entertaining and provide a nice glimpse into life on the road, they break up the flow of the concert.  The disk would have been better served to show the full concert and offer the other views as extras.

723838,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00007149K,Reviewer,"[10, 14]","This film puts you front row center with one of the immortals, Paul McCartney:  The Beatle; the icon; and the man.  And, of course, there's the music.  ""Paul McCartney-- Back In the U.S,"" is much more than ""just"" the music, however; it's an experience, and one you can now live over and over again thanks to the magic of DVD/video.The cameras follow Paul and his band on this 2002 tour of the U.S., from New York to Los Angeles (where as they pan the audience you get glimpses of such luminaries as Jack Nicholson, Michael Douglas, John Cusack and Steve Buscemi, among others) and a number of stops at cities and venues along the way as they crisscross the country.  The music is great, Paul looks and sounds good, and you also get some insights into how it all came together and what it's like on the other side of the curtain, through brief interviews and/or comments from Paul, members of his band and others who work so hard behind the scenes to make it all happen (and to give you an idea of the magnitude of their endeavors, it took twelve semi-trucks to haul equipment and sets from one place to the next).But what really makes this film engrossing is what the eye of the camera captures as it sweeps the audience, which makes it quite evident that this is not just another concert, but history in the making and being revisited, playing out and documented here for posterity, and clearly transcending show business in general and the music business in particular.  There are old and young alike in attendance, exhibiting every possible emotion; some through totally uninhibited revelry, others more introspective-- internalizing the moment though every bit as exuberant as those who express themselves openly.  And there are some genuinely profound moments captured here, as you can clearly see in the eyes of especially the more ""mature"" members of the crowd, that McCartney's music is taking them on a tour of their entire lives, creating a personal retrospective for each individual through songs that for them evoke a particular place at a specific time.  It's a spontaneous revisiting of good times and bad, as evidenced by the joy, laughter, tears, and for many by the distant, transported look of the eyes, a glassy expression signifying the timelessness, not only of the music, but of the experience itself.There are those among us who, adopting a most erudite countenance, will dismiss out-of-hand the notion that four mop-haired rock n' rollers from Liverpool changed the world as we know it, but such a stance is nothing less than an unmistakably self-serving denial of the incontrovertible facts of the matter.  Directly or indirectly, in one way or another, the Beatles touched the lives of everyone and will continue to do so as each generation discovers them anew in their own way and time, and Paul McCartney is decidedly a part of it still.  The music and the influence of McCartney and his mates is forever, and skeptics who stubbornly cling to their life rafts of refusal need look no further than ""Paul McCartney-- Back In the U.S.""  for the proof.  And acquiescence will be humbly accepted at the door.",5,More Than Just Another Concert,1038441600,"11 28, 2002",2002,3131,"['film', 'front', 'row', 'center', 'one', 'immortals', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'Beatle', 'icon', 'man', 'course', 'music', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'Back', 'U.S', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'music', 'however', 'experience', 'one', 'can', 'now', 'live', 'over', 'again', 'thanks', 'magic', 'DVD/video.The', 'cameras', 'follow', 'Paul', 'band', '2002', 'tour', 'U.S.', 'New', 'York', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'where', 'pan', 'audience', 'get', 'glimpses', 'such', 'luminaries', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'others', 'number', 'stops', 'cities', 'venues', 'way', 'crisscross', 'country', 'music', 'great', 'Paul', 'good', 'also', 'get', 'insights', 'how', 'came', 'together', 'what', 'other', 'side', 'curtain', 'brief', 'interviews', 'and/or', 'comments', 'Paul', 'members', 'band', 'others', 'who', 'work', 'so', 'hard', 'scenes', 'make', 'happen', 'give', 'idea', 'magnitude', 'endeavors', 'took', 'twelve', 'semi-trucks', 'haul', 'equipment', 'sets', 'one', 'place', 'next', '.But', 'what', 'really', 'film', 'engrossing', 'what', 'eye', 'camera', 'audience', 'quite', 'evident', 'not', 'just', 'concert', 'history', 'making', 'being', 'revisited', 'playing', 'out', 'documented', 'here', 'posterity', 'clearly', 'transcending', 'show', 'business', 'general', 'music', 'business', 'particular', 'are', 'old', 'young', 'alike', 'attendance', 'exhibiting', 'possible', 'emotion', 'totally', 'uninhibited', 'revelry', 'others', 'more', 'introspective', 'internalizing', 'moment', 'bit', 'as', 'exuberant', 'who', 'express', 'openly', 'are', 'genuinely', 'profound', 'moments', 'captured', 'here', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'eyes', 'especially', 'more', 'mature', 'members', 'crowd', 'McCartney', 'music', 'taking', 'tour', 'entire', 'lives', 'creating', 'personal', 'retrospective', 'individual', 'songs', 'evoke', 'particular', 'place', 'specific', 'time', 'spontaneous', 'revisiting', 'good', 'times', 'bad', 'evidenced', 'joy', 'laughter', 'tears', 'many', 'distant', 'transported', 'look', 'eyes', 'glassy', 'expression', 'signifying', 'timelessness', 'not', 'only', 'music', 'experience', 'are', 'who', 'adopting', 'most', 'erudite', 'countenance', 'will', 'dismiss', 'out-of-hand', 'notion', 'four', 'mop-haired', 'rock', 'n', 'rollers', 'Liverpool', 'changed', 'world', 'know', 'stance', 'nothing', 'less', 'unmistakably', 'self-serving', 'denial', 'incontrovertible', 'facts', 'matter', 'Directly', 'indirectly', 'one', 'way', 'Beatles', 'touched', 'lives', 'everyone', 'will', 'continue', 'do', 'so', 'generation', 'anew', 'own', 'way', 'time', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'decidedly', 'part', 'still', 'music', 'influence', 'McCartney', 'mates', 'forever', 'skeptics', 'who', 'stubbornly', 'cling', 'life', 'rafts', 'refusal', 'need', 'look', 'further', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'Back', 'U.S.', 'proof', 'acquiescence', 'will', 'be', 'humbly', 'accepted', 'door']",Paul McCartney: Back in the U.S. - Live 2002 Concert Film

As for the negative reviews of this disc here, the probability is very high that these people did not attend one of Paul's shows on this tour and shamefully so - you're probably Paul-bashers from way back and anything the man does will not meet your approval anyway. But enough on that: I did attend Paul's show in NC last year and it was the best concert I've ever been to. I've had this DVD for about a year and just recently gave it a fresh viewing, putting some space between when I actually saw him live and seeing this video for a more objective opinion and found that this show is just awesome. Paul's in great voice, his band is top-notch. Rusty Anderson is an excellent lead guitarist, Brian Ray has those classic Paul bass riffs down superbly - just listen to &quot;Getting Better&quot;. And, oh man, Abraham Laboriel, Jr is one of the best drummers I've ever seen and heard; like Paul himself says in the video, &quot;Abe is a serious drummer&quot;. How anyone can look at this DVD and not get into these Beatle &amp; solo Paul classics performed so energetically is way beyond my comprehension. I was sitting and watching Paul &amp; his band playing some of these tunes and thinking to myself, &quot;even if the other Beatles were still around to reunite, could they be any better than this?&quot;  That statement might infuriate a few Beatles purist, but so be it -I'm as big a Beatles fan as the next guy.

723848,A19DW3VKM5KKYB,B00007149K,TheBandit,"[11, 12]","I attended two concerts from the Driving USA tour in 2002.  I really hoped this dvd would be an accurate representation of what the complete show was like.  Instead, the apparent idea was to make a &quot;documentary&quot; of what it was like backstage and on the road, while also showing us songs from the concerts.  The DVD sometimes feels like a 2 hour promotional piece, straining to show what an &quot;event&quot; this tour was.  Well, having been there, I can say that it WAS definitely quite an event.  But this presentation doesn't really communicate that.First off, what did I like about the DVD?  The performances that are included are uniformly very good and sound excellent.  Most of the songs from the tour are accounted for, whether in the main program or in the &quot;bonus song&quot; section.  As a McCartney fan, I want as much music as possible, and in the best sound quality possible.  A nice inclusion was a trio of performances from soundchecks.So... I am left with a lot of negatives.  While I liked a lot of the 'backstage' and 'behind the scenes' material, I would've preferred it to be seperate from the concert footage.  That would've been perfect:  a concert presented in it's entirety, and a separate &quot;documentary&quot; showing how the tour was put together, etc.  But interrupting songs for interviews and breaking up the flow of the concert was not a great idea.The picture quality is not very clear, definitely not what we've grown accustomed to for DVD.  The recent Eric Clapton concert dvd provides a FAR superior picture, for example (and wisely presents the concert from start to finish with no interruptions).The worst offense by far was the editing of songs and the exclusion of certain songs (all of which can be found on the 2 CD set of the same name).  With DVD, it would've been easy to present the entire concert and still be able to organize all the 'behind the scenes' stuff as bonus materials.",3,Concert or infomercial?,1042934400,"01 19, 2003",2003,1942,"['attended', 'two', 'concerts', 'Driving', 'USA', 'tour', '2002', 'really', 'hoped', 'dvd', 'would', 'be', 'accurate', 'representation', 'what', 'complete', 'show', 'was', 'Instead', 'apparent', 'idea', 'was', 'make', 'quot', 'documentary', 'quot', 'what', 'was', 'like', 'backstage', 'road', 'also', 'showing', 'songs', 'concerts', 'DVD', 'sometimes', '2', 'hour', 'promotional', 'piece', 'straining', 'show', 'what', 'quot', 'event', 'quot', 'tour', 'was', 'Well', 'having', 'been', 'there', 'can', 'say', 'WAS', 'definitely', 'quite', 'event', 'presentation', ""n't"", 'really', 'communicate', 'that.First', 'what', 'did', 'like', 'DVD', 'performances', 'are', 'included', 'are', 'uniformly', 'very', 'good', 'sound', 'excellent', 'Most', 'songs', 'tour', 'are', 'accounted', 'main', 'program', 'quot', 'song', 'quot', 'section', 'McCartney', 'fan', 'want', 'much', 'music', 'possible', 'best', 'sound', 'quality', 'possible', 'nice', 'inclusion', 'was', 'trio', 'performances', 'soundchecks.So', 'am', 'left', 'lot', 'negatives', 'liked', 'lot', ""'backstage"", 'scenes', 'material', 'would', ""'ve"", 'preferred', 'be', 'seperate', 'concert', 'footage', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'perfect', 'concert', 'presented', 'entirety', 'separate', 'quot', 'documentary', 'quot', 'showing', 'how', 'tour', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'etc', 'interrupting', 'songs', 'interviews', 'breaking', 'up', 'flow', 'concert', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'idea.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'not', 'very', 'clear', 'definitely', 'not', 'what', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'accustomed', 'DVD', 'recent', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'concert', 'dvd', 'FAR', 'superior', 'picture', 'example', 'wisely', 'concert', 'start', 'finish', 'interruptions', '.The', 'worst', 'offense', 'far', 'was', 'editing', 'songs', 'exclusion', 'certain', 'songs', 'can', 'be', 'found', '2', 'CD', 'set', 'same', 'name', 'DVD', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'easy', 'present', 'entire', 'concert', 'still', 'be', 'able', 'organize', 'scenes', 'stuff', 'bonus', 'materials']",Paul McCartney: Back in the U.S. - Live 2002 Concert Film

723852,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00007149K,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[3, 4]","Macca's performance is top notch in this DVD of his tour of the United States. The songs and performances (particularly Getting Better, Live and Let Die, Band on the Run, Coming Up and Sgt. Pepper Reprise/The End)highlight this band as of one Macca's best. Despite the fact that this is patched together from a number of performances (pretty seamlessly I might add), the concert has a pretty good flow.The pros--you get to see the band perform three songs during rehearsal (Midnight Special, San Francisco Bay, Good Rockin' Tonight)plus three bonus selections (including the marvelous Every Night)and the expected classics. There are a number of surprises (if you have seen Macca before and didn't catch him this time)including a beautiful tribute to John and George.Although occasionally grainy (probably due to the low light or digital transfer, the picture quality is very good overall. The director manages to capture the mood of the performances and the audience. Some folks have complained about the audience shots--I believe the director was trying to recreate the experience of being at a concert where you watch the performer and (at least we did) check out the audience as well.Without the concert footage you would have wondered why Paul's voice breaks up during his performance of The Long and Winding Road. Members of the audience are holding heart signs which make Paul tear up during the song. He gamely tries to perform it but it's quite a nice genuine, emotional moment. He also comments on it as well (albeit briefly).The cons--I would have liked the option with the angle function to either watch the band (and Paul) the whole time or view it the way it was shot. Audience shots get a bit old after watching a concert special a couple of times. Yes, we know it's live. The DVD format should have allowed fans to access rehearsals, outtakes, etc. during the actual performances (basically the disc needed to be more interactive). Perhaps a section where Paul discusses how it feels to be performing many of his Beatles/Wings/solo classics that he's never played live before.How could they cut off Hey Jude? In the concert DVD it begins in the middle of the song. It spoils the concert's momentum and, again, going outside the performance and venue does hurt the pacing. It's distracting and could have been an ""extra"" feature.I also would have loved the additional tracks that Paul added to the second swing of his US tour; She's Leaving Home was performed beautifully by the band. Perhaps we could have seen the rehearsal for this track (and a couple of the other changes) since they probably hadn't been incorporated yet.There was a very active camera crew at the show I added so, perhaps, the performances were being taped in addition to being shown on the monitors. Paul is in fine voice throughout although there are a couple of tracks where it's clear he's lost some of his upper register (but that's to be expected given his age, the amount of performances0. Really his voice has matured and has a bluesy edge that was only hinted at before.All in all this would be a nice gift for fans of Paul and, as a momento of his performance, would be a nice addition to any Beatle/Macca fan's collection. It's flawed but those flaws don't detract from the best performances on the DVD.I'd suggest picking up the 2 disc CD as well. The performances there are straight forward (and the DVD-Audio or SACD will probably have multichannel versions of these very same tracks with a year or two)and without the visual interruptions seen here.",4,Flawed but fun concert DVD,1039305600,"12 8, 2002",2002,3551,"['Macca', 'performance', 'top', 'notch', 'DVD', 'tour', 'United', 'States', 'songs', 'performances', 'particularly', 'Getting', 'Better', 'Live', 'Let', 'Die', 'Band', 'Run', 'Coming', 'Up', 'Sgt', 'Pepper', 'Reprise/The', 'End', 'highlight', 'band', 'one', 'Macca', 'best', 'fact', 'patched', 'together', 'number', 'performances', 'pretty', 'seamlessly', 'might', 'add', 'concert', 'pretty', 'good', 'flow.The', 'pros', 'get', 'see', 'band', 'perform', 'three', 'songs', 'rehearsal', 'Midnight', 'Special', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Bay', 'Good', 'Rockin', 'Tonight', 'three', 'bonus', 'selections', 'including', 'marvelous', 'Every', 'Night', 'expected', 'classics', 'are', 'number', 'surprises', 'have', 'seen', 'Macca', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'time', 'including', 'beautiful', 'tribute', 'John', 'George.Although', 'occasionally', 'grainy', 'probably', 'due', 'low', 'light', 'digital', 'transfer', 'picture', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'overall', 'director', 'capture', 'mood', 'performances', 'audience', 'folks', 'have', 'complained', 'audience', 'shots', 'believe', 'director', 'was', 'trying', 'recreate', 'experience', 'being', 'concert', 'where', 'watch', 'performer', 'least', 'did', 'check', 'out', 'audience', 'concert', 'footage', 'would', 'have', 'wondered', 'why', 'Paul', 'voice', 'up', 'performance', 'Long', 'Winding', 'Road', 'Members', 'audience', 'are', 'holding', 'heart', 'signs', 'make', 'Paul', 'tear', 'up', 'song', 'gamely', 'perform', 'quite', 'nice', 'genuine', 'emotional', 'moment', 'also', 'comments', 'as', 'well', 'briefly', '.The', 'cons', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'option', 'angle', 'function', 'watch', 'band', 'Paul', 'whole', 'time', 'view', 'way', 'was', 'shot', 'Audience', 'shots', 'get', 'bit', 'old', 'watching', 'concert', 'special', 'couple', 'times', 'Yes', 'know', 'live', 'DVD', 'format', 'should', 'have', 'allowed', 'fans', 'access', 'rehearsals', 'outtakes', 'etc', 'actual', 'performances', 'basically', 'disc', 'needed', 'be', 'more', 'interactive', 'Perhaps', 'section', 'where', 'Paul', 'how', 'be', 'performing', 'many', 'Beatles/Wings/solo', 'classics', 'never', 'played', 'live', 'before.How', 'could', 'cut', 'off', 'Hey', 'Jude', 'concert', 'DVD', 'middle', 'song', 'concert', 'momentum', 'again', 'going', 'performance', 'venue', 'hurt', 'pacing', 'distracting', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'extra', 'feature.I', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'additional', 'tracks', 'Paul', 'added', 'second', 'swing', 'US', 'tour', 'Leaving', 'Home', 'was', 'performed', 'beautifully', 'band', 'Perhaps', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'rehearsal', 'track', 'couple', 'other', 'changes', 'probably', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'incorporated', 'yet.There', 'was', 'very', 'active', 'camera', 'crew', 'show', 'added', 'so', 'perhaps', 'performances', 'were', 'being', 'taped', 'addition', 'being', 'shown', 'monitors', 'Paul', 'fine', 'voice', 'are', 'couple', 'tracks', 'where', 'clear', 'lost', 'upper', 'register', 'be', 'expected', 'given', 'age', 'amount', 'performances0', 'Really', 'voice', 'matured', 'bluesy', 'edge', 'was', 'only', 'hinted', 'before.All', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'gift', 'fans', 'Paul', 'momento', 'performance', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'addition', 'Beatle/Macca', 'fan', 'collection', 'flawed', 'flaws', 'do', ""n't"", 'detract', 'best', 'performances', 'DVD.I', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'picking', 'up', '2', 'disc', 'CD', 'as', 'well', 'performances', 'are', 'straight', 'forward', 'DVD-Audio', 'SACD', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'multichannel', 'versions', 'very', 'same', 'tracks', 'year', 'two', 'visual', 'interruptions', 'seen', 'here']",Paul McCartney: Back in the U.S. - Live 2002 Concert Film
