Through clips from their Columbia shorts, the MGM shorts they made with Ted Healy, the movies they made guest appearances in, television appearances they made in the final stretch of their career, and numerous interviews, the viewer gets a full picture of the Stooges as individuals, how their careers began and developed, what makes their comedy so timeless and endearing in spite of the violence, and their legacy.  Along with the requisite familiar footage (such as overrepresentation from the 4 public domain shorts and 'Heavenly Daze,' which at one point was mistakenly believed to be public domain also) are also rarer clips, such as from the movies they made guest appearances in, their MGM shorts in the early Thirties (including one in early Technicolor), some of Shemp's solo films, and appearances on various television shows.  Of particular value are all of the interviews, such as the ones with Emil Sitka (their frequent co-star) and Ed Bernds (one of their best directors), as well as interviews with Moe from the late Fifties and the early Seventies.  Particularly priceless are the clips from his appearance on the Mike Douglas Show in the Seventies, where he recreates the old Niagara Falls skit and later gets a pie in the face from his wife in the audience.  Larry's last recorded interview from 1973 is also featured.  The Larry interview, while deeply informative and enjoyable, is also a bit distressing to watch because he looked old and sick, and his speech was a bit affected from the stroke he'd had a few years earlier.  There's even an interview with Curly's second wife Elaine and their daughter Marilyn.  There might be a bit of overreliance on clips to tell the story, but it's not as though the clips are being used to make up for nothing of value to say.  Apart from the overreliance on clips, the only major flaws I could find with it are that they report a couple of urban legends as fact, some things don't go into as much detail as possible, and they got Curly's year of birth and date of death wrong.  While I'd more highly recommend a documentary like 'The Men Behind the Mayhem,' this one has a lot of great information as well.",4,A pretty solid documentary,1187827200,"08 23, 2007",2007,2413,"['documentary', 'jump', 'timeline', 'few', 'times', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'extraordinarily', 'high', 'budget', 'lot', 'footage', 'available', 'bunch', 'other', 'discs', 'overall', 'pretty', 'engrossing', 'informative', 'clips', 'Columbia', 'shorts', 'MGM', 'shorts', 'made', 'Ted', 'Healy', 'movies', 'made', 'guest', 'appearances', 'television', 'appearances', 'made', 'final', 'stretch', 'career', 'numerous', 'interviews', 'viewer', 'full', 'picture', 'Stooges', 'individuals', 'how', 'careers', 'began', 'developed', 'what', 'comedy', 'timeless', 'endearing', 'spite', 'violence', 'legacy', 'requisite', 'familiar', 'footage', 'such', 'overrepresentation', '4', 'public', 'domain', 'shorts', ""'Heavenly"", 'Daze', 'one', 'point', 'was', 'mistakenly', 'believed', 'be', 'public', 'domain', 'also', 'are', 'also', 'rarer', 'clips', 'such', 'movies', 'made', 'guest', 'appearances', 'MGM', 'shorts', 'early', 'Thirties', 'including', 'one', 'early', 'Technicolor', 'Shemp', 'solo', 'films', 'appearances', 'various', 'television', 'shows', 'particular', 'value', 'are', 'interviews', 'such', 'ones', 'Emil', 'Sitka', 'frequent', 'co-star', 'Ed', 'Bernds', 'one', 'best', 'directors', 'as', 'well', 'interviews', 'Moe', 'late', 'Fifties', 'early', 'Seventies', 'Particularly', 'priceless', 'are', 'clips', 'appearance', 'Mike', 'Douglas', 'Show', 'Seventies', 'where', 'old', 'Niagara', 'Falls', 'skit', 'later', 'pie', 'face', 'wife', 'audience', 'Larry', 'last', 'recorded', 'interview', '1973', 'also', 'featured', 'Larry', 'interview', 'deeply', 'informative', 'enjoyable', 'also', 'bit', 'distressing', 'watch', 'looked', 'old', 'sick', 'speech', 'was', 'bit', 'affected', 'stroke', ""'d"", 'had', 'few', 'years', 'earlier', 'even', 'interview', 'Curly', 'second', 'wife', 'Elaine', 'daughter', 'Marilyn', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'overreliance', 'clips', 'tell', 'story', 'not', 'clips', 'are', 'being', 'used', 'make', 'up', 'nothing', 'value', 'say', 'Apart', 'overreliance', 'clips', 'only', 'major', 'flaws', 'could', 'find', 'are', 'report', 'couple', 'urban', 'legends', 'fact', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'much', 'detail', 'possible', 'got', 'Curly', 'year', 'birth', 'date', 'death', 'wrong', ""'d"", 'more', 'highly', 'recommend', 'documentary', ""'The"", 'Men', 'Mayhem', 'one', 'lot', 'great', 'information', 'as', 'well']",N/A

Often, old film clips that have nothing to do with the stooges are inserted as filler material.

I've bought lots of Stooges tapes, seen lots of footage.  This was crammed with stuff I had never seen before, including:- footage from one of Larry Fine's last interviews.- interviews with Emil Sitka (longtime Stooges co-star), and Ed Burns (director). Some of the footage shown was used in the inferior doc 'The Making Of The Stooges', but most of it wasn't.- color footage and more clips from the rarely seen Ted Healy MGM shorts from the early 30's.- TV commercials, some from the late 60s!- TV appearances, including The Steve Allen Show.- Rare Interview footage with Moe, Larry, & Curly Joe from the late 1950's- Trailers for rarer films, such as Gold Raiders and Stooges Fun-O-RamaAnyone who says they've seen all this footage lots of times is spoiled; just becuase it's public domain doesn't mean it's not worthwhile.  The use of stock footage didn't seem unusual to me; I'm sure the budget didn't allow for hunting down rare photographs, and you have to have something going while the narrator's talking.While it does have a lot of stuff from the 4 public domain shorts (and Heavenly Daze, I wonder if that's PD now), it doesn't totally depend on them like The Making of The Stooges or even the A&E; Biography did.Unlike those biographies, instead of learning the basics of The Stooges' lives, I also felt I learned more about their personalities, particulary Moe and Larry, who are not often talked about.If there's anything I can say against this documentary, it's that it might be too detailed for a casual fan.  If you don't know anything about The Stooges and want to find out more, you'd be better off with The Men Behind The Mayhem DVD.  But for the hardcore fan who knows every short, this is a great buy.The DVD itself is certainly not the highest of quality (the one I bought didn't even have chapter stops, but it was part of a set.) but the rarity of the footage and the bargain price make this an essential purchase for all Three Stooges fans.",5,The Best Stooges Documentary I've Seen,1125792000,"09 4, 2005",2005,2126,"['was', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'reading', 'nasty', 'reviews', 'nearly', '2-hour', 'DVD', 'fantastic.I', ""'m"", 'longtime', 'Stooges', 'fan', 'fifteen', 'years', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'lots', 'Stooges', 'tapes', 'seen', 'lots', 'footage', 'was', 'crammed', 'stuff', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'including', 'footage', 'one', 'Larry', 'Fine', 'last', 'interviews.-', 'interviews', 'Emil', 'Sitka', 'longtime', 'Stooges', 'co-star', 'Ed', 'Burns', 'director', 'footage', 'shown', 'was', 'used', 'inferior', 'doc', ""'The"", 'Making', 'Stooges', 'most', ""wasn't.-"", 'color', 'footage', 'more', 'clips', 'rarely', 'seen', 'Ted', 'Healy', 'MGM', 'shorts', 'early', ""30's.-"", 'TV', 'commercials', 'late', '60s', 'TV', 'appearances', 'including', 'Steve', 'Allen', 'Show.-', 'Rare', 'Interview', 'footage', 'Moe', 'Larry', 'Curly', 'Joe', 'late', ""1950's-"", 'Trailers', 'rarer', 'films', 'such', 'Gold', 'Raiders', 'Stooges', 'Fun-O-RamaAnyone', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'footage', 'lots', 'times', 'spoiled', 'just', 'becuase', 'public', 'domain', ""n't"", 'mean', 'not', 'worthwhile', 'use', 'stock', 'footage', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'unusual', ""'m"", 'sure', 'budget', 'did', ""n't"", 'allow', 'hunting', 'down', 'rare', 'photographs', 'have', 'have', 'something', 'going', 'narrator', 'talking.While', 'have', 'lot', 'stuff', '4', 'public', 'domain', 'shorts', 'Heavenly', 'Daze', 'wonder', 'PD', 'now', ""n't"", 'totally', 'depend', 'Making', 'Stooges', 'even', 'A', 'E', 'Biography', 'biographies', 'instead', 'learning', 'basics', 'Stooges', 'lives', 'also', 'felt', 'learned', 'more', 'personalities', 'particulary', 'Moe', 'Larry', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'often', 'talked', 'anything', 'can', 'say', 'documentary', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'detailed', 'casual', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'Stooges', 'want', 'find', 'out', 'more', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'off', 'Men', 'Mayhem', 'DVD', 'hardcore', 'fan', 'who', 'short', 'great', 'buy.The', 'DVD', 'certainly', 'not', 'highest', 'quality', 'one', 'bought', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'chapter', 'stops', 'was', 'part', 'set', 'rarity', 'footage', 'bargain', 'price', 'make', 'essential', 'purchase', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'fans']",N/A

Sure there was a lot of footage from the 4 public domain shorts all stooge fans are familiar with, but there are also clips from many of the Healy era MGM films, clips from ""Heavenly Daze"", the new 3 stooges series, plus various clips from many television shows the stooges appeared on, rare interviews, and great clips from many of the behind the scenes collaborators of the stooges such as Henry Freulich, Jules White and the great Ed Bernds.Plus there's a lot of clips of great stooge foil and almost stooge Emil Sitka. I think all of the above mentioned clips cancel out any gripes about the use of footage from the PD shorts.If I had any reservations about this DVD is that more of the spotlight isn't shown on some of the great supporting players who contributed so much to the stooge films like Christine McIntyre, Vernon Dent or Bud Jamison, but that's only a minor gripe.Also, as a Shemp fan, I'm glad to see he was given a segment all his own, the same as Moe, Larry and Curly and that his work with the team is spoken of in a positive light.

579768,A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,B00005B1WV,Phil S.,"[3, 3]","I like my Stooges hard and heavy, fast and furious, and this documentary rocks! For Stooge-philes there's nothing new, save many rare stills and a few unfamiliar clips even this fan of nearly 50 years.Downside: at the time of production, apparently only four Columbia shorts were available to cull from, and so it's the same ol' same ol', as strong as they are. Without the full catalogue, we have that treadmill effect, and lose the chance for alot of brilliant, actually dialogue-driven material. With all the crazy visuals and sound effects, some of the best comedy writing - in History! - is lost, and is clouded by some of the worst examples of unnecessary, unfunny violence ever captured on celluloid. The documentary adroitly points out that when the shorts finally made it to TV, parents were shocked by some of the bits involving hachets, hammers, and the like. And you know what? They were right...and so were the TV stations who went to work to trim off alot of garbage.Having said that, let's state unequivocally that they were a fabulous team who were held back in many ways, by the tired, predicable schtick. And this program has too much of that banging around (from the pre-Columbia days before they worked with brilliant sound and editing technicians).Alot of time is spent on Ted Healey here, and he of course was, or is reported to be, the first Stooge supervisor. His talent for oration and singing; his timing and stage presence was remarkable. He could almost perform at the level of W. C. Fields, as well. But he, too, was not the ""writer"", say, like Stan Laurel and Groucho Marx, etc. So his gifts were often guilded in gruesome stuff, where he appears somewhat sadistic. In short [no pun]...none too funny.Perhaps less biographical data was needed on the main players - it's about time that the Stooges troupe got more attention: Symona Boniface, Christine MacIntire, et. al., were excellent. But then it goes back to the (surmised) availability of the material.Kudos to the producer for *finally* mentioning that Curly made not one, but *two* cameos! Yes, the second one came in '49, and sadly, the only reported remnant is a single still used on a lobby card. I've been terribly disappointed that it seems that I am the only fan who is interested in learning alot more about that significant event - and naturally, to watch the actual deleted scene. Why would Columbia discard that?I disagree with one reviewer who said that the writers, behind-the-scenes folks, had nothing interesting to say. Just the mention of the importance of the sound-effects man to their careers, is huge.Still waitin' on ""Malice In The Palace"" (alternate take).",4,Great value especially for the unitiated,1201910400,"02 2, 2008",2008,2665,"['like', 'Stooges', 'hard', 'heavy', 'fast', 'furious', 'documentary', 'rocks', 'Stooge-philes', 'nothing', 'new', 'save', 'many', 'rare', 'stills', 'few', 'unfamiliar', 'clips', 'even', 'fan', 'nearly', '50', 'years.Downside', 'time', 'production', 'apparently', 'only', 'four', 'Columbia', 'shorts', 'were', 'available', 'cull', 'same', 'ol', 'same', 'ol', 'as', 'strong', 'are', 'full', 'catalogue', 'have', 'treadmill', 'effect', 'lose', 'chance', 'alot', 'brilliant', 'actually', 'dialogue-driven', 'material', 'crazy', 'visuals', 'sound', 'effects', 'best', 'comedy', 'writing', 'History', 'lost', 'clouded', 'worst', 'examples', 'unnecessary', 'unfunny', 'violence', 'ever', 'captured', 'celluloid', 'documentary', 'adroitly', 'out', 'when', 'shorts', 'finally', 'made', 'TV', 'parents', 'were', 'shocked', 'bits', 'involving', 'hachets', 'hammers', 'like', 'know', 'what', 'were', 'right', 'so', 'were', 'TV', 'stations', 'who', 'went', 'work', 'trim', 'off', 'alot', 'garbage.Having', 'said', 'let', 'state', 'unequivocally', 'were', 'fabulous', 'team', 'who', 'were', 'held', 'back', 'many', 'ways', 'tired', 'predicable', 'schtick', 'program', 'too', 'much', 'banging', 'around', 'pre-Columbia', 'days', 'worked', 'brilliant', 'sound', 'editing', 'technicians', '.Alot', 'time', 'spent', 'Ted', 'Healey', 'here', 'course', 'was', 'reported', 'be', 'first', 'Stooge', 'supervisor', 'talent', 'oration', 'singing', 'timing', 'stage', 'presence', 'was', 'remarkable', 'could', 'almost', 'perform', 'level', 'W.', 'C.', 'Fields', 'as', 'well', 'too', 'was', 'not', 'writer', 'say', 'Stan', 'Laurel', 'Groucho', 'Marx', 'etc', 'gifts', 'were', 'often', 'guilded', 'gruesome', 'stuff', 'where', 'somewhat', 'sadistic', 'short', '[', 'pun', ']', 'none', 'too', 'funny.Perhaps', 'less', 'biographical', 'data', 'was', 'needed', 'main', 'players', 'time', 'Stooges', 'troupe', 'got', 'more', 'attention', 'Symona', 'Boniface', 'Christine', 'MacIntire', 'et', 'al.', 'were', 'excellent', 'then', 'back', 'surmised', 'availability', 'material.Kudos', 'producer', '*finally*', 'mentioning', 'Curly', 'made', 'not', 'one', '*two*', 'cameos', 'Yes', 'second', 'one', 'came', ""'49"", 'sadly', 'only', 'reported', 'remnant', 'single', 'still', 'used', 'lobby', 'card', ""'ve"", 'been', 'terribly', 'disappointed', 'am', 'only', 'fan', 'who', 'interested', 'learning', 'alot', 'more', 'significant', 'event', 'naturally', 'watch', 'actual', 'deleted', 'scene', 'Why', 'would', 'Columbia', 'discard', 'disagree', 'one', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', 'writers', 'behind-the-scenes', 'folks', 'had', 'nothing', 'interesting', 'say', 'Just', 'mention', 'importance', 'sound-effects', 'man', 'careers', 'huge.Still', 'waitin', 'Malice', 'Palace', 'alternate', 'take']",N/A
