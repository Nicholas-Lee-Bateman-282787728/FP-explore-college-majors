Well, this story is a lot more than that, but you might as well enjoy the fantastic insects and nature scenery of Costa Rica while going along for this ride. This is another based-on-a-true story film, about boy dying of brain cancer getting his wish to go track down the mysterious ""Blue Morpho"" butterfly which supposedly brings magical powers.The film stars William Hurt and a couple of unknown actors: Marc Donato, who plays the boy, ""Pete Carlton,"" and Pascale Bussieres as his mom, ""Teresa."" All three do a fine job.I really enjoyed the wildlife photography. Some of the insects, reptiles, birds and animals in that part of the world are just amazing. The story tries hard not to be sentimental, sometimes too hard and also infers near the end that the young boy was magically healed by some spirits of the jungle. Filmmakers love promoting mystical New Age-type stuff. Nonetheless, unlike what I expected, there was a happy ending to this story. Most importantly it was happy conclusion for the real person. Obviously, that is what is really important.This is the real-life story of David Marenger, who is a grateful, now-healthy young man who spends his time wisely helping other kids with illnesses.

975963,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000EPFCN6,Grady Harp,"[4, 4]","THE BLUE BUTTERFLY, made in 2004, is based on a true story as adapted for the screen by Pete McCormick and as directed by L&eacute;a Pool. Looking for this DVD in the usual places finds it listed under Family  entertainment, and with the right family this film could raise some worthy discussions.  But THE BLUE BUTTERFLY  is not a typical Hallmark-type presentation: it is based on fine acting by a varied cast gathered from Canada, the USA, and Costa Rica, it is a beautifully sculpted nature film, and it introduces a fact - that miracles do happen.  It deserves a wider audience.Alan Osborne (William Hurt) is an well known Entomologist who is visiting Montreal of the dedication of a science building named in his honor.  There the busy Osborne meets 10-year-old Pete Carlton (the fine young Canadian actor Marc Donato), a victim of brain cancer who is in his final month of life and who has become a devoted fan of the brilliant Osborne's books and lectures to the point that Pete wants Osborne to take him to the rain forest to capture a Blue Morpho butterfly - the Blue Morpho Butterfly (Morpho menelaus) is an iridescent blue butterfly from South American rain forests and is an insect Pete remembers Osborne as calling 'magic'. Pete's devoted mother Teresa (then incandescent Canadian actress Pascale Bussi&egrave;res) accompanies Pete to meet Osborne, shares her son's lack of future, and ultimately convinces Osborne to take Pete to the rain forest despite Osborne's hesitation.  From here the film is all located in the rain forest (here, Costa Rica as captured on film by Director of Photography Pierre Mignot who also is responsible for the extraordinarily beautiful close-up images of all manner of insects and wildlife), and with the help of a friendly village lead by Alejo (Raoul Trujillo) the group (Pete, Osborne, Teresa, Alejo and guides) sets out to find and capture the Blue Butterfly.  What follows is a journey that tests faith, shows courage and mends bruised lives: the capture of the desired butterfly and the manner it is handled is one of the little miracles of the film - the real 'miracle' is that upon return to Canada, Pete is diagnosed free of tumor!Films such as this can, in the wrong hands, become maudlin and saccharine, but from the script through the direction through the acting of the cast this film exceeds expectations.  it is a lovely little movie that restores faith in the power of human kindness.

He had an avid interest in entomology and especially butterflies.  His last wish before he died was to meet up with a famous entomology expert and go with him to the rain forest in South America to find and capture a rare blue butterfly, with local folklore of it having special qualities.  This was a story based on a true life experience.He finally met the famous (William Hurt) entomologist, who wanted no part of the deal and furthermore didn't like kids.  This boy however, won him over and he and his mom flew with Hurt to the rain forest.This movie is about their story while trying to find this butterfly, and the near death experience it was for both of them.  I did really like the relationship that began to develop with Hurt and the boy and his mom.  I loved all the beautiful nature scenes, although some of the bugs and beetle shots in the movie made my skin crawl.  I guess that's also a sign of realism.  The rare butterfly was amazing to see fly.  I won't spoil the end of the movie in a review, but I did really enjoy this movie.William Hurt does a great job at being a moody, grumpy yet sorta lovable character.  Marc Donato does a great job in his role as well.",4,The Blue Butterfly DVD,1236988800,"03 14, 2009",2009,1275,"['story', '10', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'terminal', 'brain', 'tumor', 'last', 'weeks', 'life', 'had', 'avid', 'interest', 'entomology', 'especially', 'butterflies', 'last', 'wish', 'died', 'was', 'meet', 'up', 'famous', 'entomology', 'expert', 'go', 'rain', 'forest', 'South', 'America', 'find', 'capture', 'rare', 'blue', 'butterfly', 'local', 'folklore', 'having', 'special', 'qualities', 'was', 'story', 'based', 'true', 'life', 'finally', 'met', 'famous', 'William', 'Hurt', 'entomologist', 'who', 'wanted', 'part', 'deal', 'furthermore', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'kids', 'boy', 'however', 'won', 'mom', 'flew', 'Hurt', 'rain', 'forest.This', 'movie', 'story', 'trying', 'find', 'butterfly', 'near', 'death', 'experience', 'was', 'did', 'really', 'relationship', 'began', 'develop', 'Hurt', 'boy', 'mom', 'loved', 'beautiful', 'nature', 'scenes', 'bugs', 'beetle', 'shots', 'movie', 'made', 'skin', 'crawl', 'guess', 'also', 'sign', 'realism', 'rare', 'butterfly', 'was', 'amazing', 'see', 'fly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'end', 'movie', 'review', 'did', 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie.William', 'Hurt', 'great', 'job', 'being', 'moody', 'grumpy', 'yet', 'sorta', 'lovable', 'character', 'Marc', 'Donato', 'great', 'job', 'role', 'as', 'well']",N/A
