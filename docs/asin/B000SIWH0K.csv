It may have Henry (the youngest brother/son)on the cover and the spine of the DVD case, but he isn't in any of the episodes/season 5.  The packaging of the DVD is much simpler than previous releases other releases - slim cases, slipcover, double sided covers, ect. This one is just a standard black case, two disc holder, and insert. It's an okay season. I recommend it anyways.",4,Grounded for Life: Season 5,1295308800,"01 18, 2011",2011,455,"['One', 'greatest', 'shows', 'ever', 'weakest', 'season', 'released', 'may', 'have', 'Henry', 'youngest', 'brother/son', 'cover', 'spine', 'DVD', 'case', ""n't"", 'episodes/season', '5', 'packaging', 'DVD', 'much', 'simpler', 'previous', 'releases', 'other', 'releases', 'slim', 'cases', 'slipcover', 'double', 'sided', 'covers', 'ect', 'one', 'just', 'standard', 'black', 'case', 'two', 'disc', 'holder', 'insert', 'okay', 'season', 'recommend']",Grounded for Life: Season 5

Grounded For Life (alongside Seinfeld) still stands as my favorite (non Star Trek) TV show of all time.  Unfortunetly, by the time season 5 came around, the shows creators had been called off to write for other shows and did not write this season.  I must admit that it shows and the series suffered for it.  And what ever happened to Henry?  It was like he was wiped out of existance and out of everyones memory in this season.  I think they said his name once in the last episode, and that was all for the whole season.  I figured he'd at least come back in with Walt (who was also pretty much non-existant in the season) in the end of the final episode, but he was no where to be found.  I was disapointed in the DVD.  It seems like the production company just threw it all together to get it out of their hair and onto the shelves as quickly as possible.  The first four seasons had a lot more care put into the DVD production.  I'm not trying to diss the show, as mentioned before I love this show.  I'm just saying that the DVD production was second rate and the writing lost some of its flair.  But for the sake of completing your Grounded For Life collection, I would still recomend picking this up.",3,Not the best ending for the show.,1201219200,"01 25, 2008",2008,1259,"['hate', 'having', 'give', 'one', 'mediochre', 'rating', 'Grounded', 'Life', 'alongside', 'Seinfeld', 'still', 'favorite', 'non', 'Star', 'Trek', 'TV', 'show', 'time', 'Unfortunetly', 'time', 'season', '5', 'came', 'around', 'shows', 'creators', 'had', 'been', 'called', 'off', 'write', 'other', 'shows', 'did', 'not', 'write', 'season', 'must', 'admit', 'series', 'suffered', 'what', 'ever', 'happened', 'Henry', 'was', 'was', 'wiped', 'existance', 'everyones', 'memory', 'season', 'think', 'said', 'name', 'once', 'last', 'episode', 'was', 'whole', 'season', 'figured', ""'d"", 'least', 'come', 'back', 'Walt', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'pretty', 'much', 'non-existant', 'season', 'end', 'final', 'episode', 'was', 'where', 'be', 'found', 'was', 'disapointed', 'DVD', 'production', 'company', 'just', 'threw', 'together', 'get', 'hair', 'shelves', 'as', 'quickly', 'possible', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'had', 'lot', 'more', 'care', 'put', 'DVD', 'production', ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'diss', 'show', 'mentioned', 'love', 'show', ""'m"", 'just', 'saying', 'DVD', 'production', 'was', 'second', 'rate', 'writing', 'lost', 'flair', 'sake', 'completing', 'Grounded', 'Life', 'collection', 'would', 'still', 'recomend', 'picking', 'up']",Grounded for Life: Season 5

My only regret is that it ended after five seasons cuz the network that owned it could have probably milked a few more seasons out of the actors.  The show is also a great depiction of middle class family life that several shows boast of having but fall short of.,4,Great Show,1200441600,"01 16, 2008",2008,347,"['one', 'time', 'favorite', 'shows', 'simple', 'reason', 'hilarious', 'only', 'regret', 'ended', 'five', 'seasons', 'cuz', 'network', 'owned', 'could', 'have', 'probably', 'milked', 'few', 'more', 'seasons', 'actors', 'show', 'also', 'great', 'depiction', 'middle', 'class', 'family', 'life', 'several', 'shows', 'boast', 'having', 'short']",Grounded for Life: Season 5

He is in all the other seasons, but for whatever reason he did not appear in this one. They continued to mention him like he was there, but he never made an appearance.
