1532651,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B007K7IBXE,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","The girls of Sakuragaoka Girl's High School's Light Music Club (K-On!) are back in season 2 of the hit Japanese animations series known as ""K-On!"".""K-ON!"", happens to be one of the hottest anime series in Japan that has not only dominated in the TV ratings but also on Japan's Oricon music charts!The series has been a phenomenon as it has attracted fans all over the world, those who want to cosplay as the characters, those who want to sing like the characters and those who want to play the music of the characters. Just one look on YouTube and all over the Internet and you can see how passionate fans have been for this series!""K-ON!"" began as a four-panel comic strip written and illustrated by kakifly and the manga would then be serialized in Houbunsha's seinen manga magazine ""Manga Time Kirara"" between May 2007-October 2010. In April 2011, the manga was relaunched on both ""Manga Time Kirara"" and Houbunsha's magazine ""Manga Time Kirara Carat"" with two separate storylines.The popularity of the manga series led to a 13-episode anime TV series which aired in Japan on April-June 2009, an OVA episode in Jan. 2010 and a 26-episode second season titled ""K-ON!!"" which aired in Japan from April through Sept. 2010, a new OVA released in March 2011 and an animated film last winter.The series would also lead to a Sony PSP music rhythm video game and now, ""K-On!"" Season Two was released in two parts on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Sentai Filmworks.VIDEO:K-ON!"" is an anime series that is stylishly created but also features beautifully painted art backgrounds. Presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 anamorphic widescreen), one thing that I love to see when it comes to anime series is the attention to detail when covering a modern setting.A lot of TV series tend to not make the backgrounds of a city landscape so detailed and tend to put a lot of recycled trees, dirt and sky but ""K-ON!"", is not one of those anime series. There are scenes and also still images of natural settings that are beautifully painted and added to the series. There is detail for the instruments, for the desserts and I felt that with each episode, aside from the practice room and the wideshot image of their school, there was always something new being featured in terms of location. So, the color palette of the series is full of color and nothing is stale or seemed regurgitated.With that being said, the colors are a bit saturated but for an anime TV series (which is expected) but the OVA does feature more vibrant colors and a bit more detail.For the many decades I have watched Japanese animation, for anime series that are set in a modern Tokyo setting, I prefer anime series that focused on the smallest details, such as what is inside their bedrooms and home. What's inside the stores when they go shopping, etc. I love seeing those details instead of the typical walls or trees that are part of the banality anime TV series.""K-ON!"" is one of those series where those little things matter and for me, those attention to small details enhanced my appreciation for the series.AUDIO:If there was a weak side of this Blu-ray release, I'm sure the audiophiles might be a bit cranky that the soundtrack is not Dolby TrueHD or DTS-HD MA. What you get is an English and Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 soundtrack. What surprised me is the fact that even with the work for the English dub version, there was no change to make it a Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack or to increase the bitrate for Dolby TrueHD or DTS-HD MA. But for a Blu-ray release, those who are expecting immersive lossless audio may fret about it, while those who have been waiting for this series to come out to the U.S. will be perfectly fine with the its 2.0 lossless soundtrack.Personally, I chose to have my receiver play the anime series with stereo on all channels for a more immersive soundscape. As for the voice acting, I am a bit biased to the Japanese voice acting but I did watch the series also with the English dub soundtrack and for the most part, both are well-done and the voice acting should appeal to fans who prefer their anime in Japan or English.Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:""K-On! Season Two, Collection 1&#8243; comes with the following special features:Clean Opening and Closing AnimationsTrailers - Sentai Filmworks trailers.JUDGMENT CALL:As a fan of ""K-On!"" and simply loving the first season, the question is how you can you continue this successful series?  And the answer is to focus on the club members as seniors in high school and having their final time together as classmates.It is sad in a way, but ""K-On!"" does capture high school life and the plans that the kids have of having a band but then having to decide what next in their lives.  To continue with music or to find careers?And that's why I'm happy to see the character of Sawako having more of an impact this season.As a former member of the Light Music Club, now advisor and teacher for Yui, Ritsu, Mio and Tsumugi, she personally knows how life went for her and her friends who were musicians and having to choose a different career path.But as the first season focused on the music and the courage of the members to perform live and create Hokago Team Time, the second season has two storylines.  One focusing on the group's final year in high school and part of the club, but also sophomore Azusa who is now starting to feel the emotions of how these young women, friends and club members who she thought were lazy and always eating cakes and drinking tea than performing, are actually much more to her life than she ever knew.These bandmates and club members have made Azusa happy, they experienced adventures together that help establish her as a person with confidence but also a new drive and that is to continue the Light Music Club by finding new members.I have to say that I really love this series!  And loved the progression of the Hokago Tea Time band and how each of these young ladies grew up together to become a band that can actually perform quite well and start playing their first major gig to now growing together and getting ready to prepare themselves to whatever happens after high school but for now, enjoying this final year together.My favorite episodes of the first half of season two includes episode 10 titled ""Sensei!"", the group following Sawako and finding out that she is meeting a former club member of the Light Music Club and a former member of the band, Death Devil.  But to see a juxtaposition of what Sawako experienced and the experiences of the members of current Light Music Club.Another favorite was ""Natsu Fesu!"" and in Japan, summer music festivals are huge!  From Summer Sonic to the Fuji Rock Festival, it was great to see Sawako taking the members to their first music festival and just seeing their eyes light up when they experience these various bands.""Atsui!"" was another fun episode as the group are lacking the energy to do anything because of high heat and humidity, and their room has no A/C.  So, it is interesting and fun to see how far they go to cool down.And to tell you the truth, every episode in this first half of season one, I enjoyed a lot!I love the fact that it focuses on normal high school life but also the formation of a band and the dynamics with each of the members as they go through their ups and downs but also the little cute quirks that come with each character.I typically don't go crazy over anime series, nor am I the hardcore fan that goes out and buys anything after I see a series but this is probably the first time since I watched an anime series such as ""Ranma 1/2&#8243; back in 1992, where I went out and started buying merchandise related to the series. In fact, I have purchased the PSP video game, the Figma figures and it has become one of my favorite series that I have really got into in a very long time in this manner.The music is awesome! The characters are entertaining. The animation and art backgrounds were very good and for the most part, it has been a long time, possibly since ""Azumanga Daioh"" in which I really enjoyed gakusei-based anime series (student anime series - focused on a school setting).As for the Blu-ray release, I know one of the major criticisms that the first season (released by Bandai Entertainment) was its price and that it only came with four episodes per volume.  And many wondered if Sentai Filmworks would follow the same path.  And fortunately, for fans, Sentai Filmworks included 13-episodes with this first collection and also for the second half as well.As for picture quality and audio quality, ""K-On!"" also receives a DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 lossless soundtrack for both English and Japanese.  And the TV series looks great on Blu-ray!  And as for special features, the first season never really came with any and the second only comes with the clean opening and ending themes.  But fortunately, fans should be happy that this second season Blu-ray release comes with the first 13-episodes, instead of just four episodes.If you are an anime fan who loves a straight-up, feel-good anime series with nothing dark, nothing to risque but something just all out-fun, give ""K-ON!"" a chance! It's a wonderful anime series on Blu-ray and there is really nothing like it out there (although one may want to check out the live action film ""Linda Linda"" if they are interested in a storyline of all-girl rock bands).Overall, a fun, hilarious and entertaining second season of ""K-ON!"" and definitely one of my favorite series to be released in 2012.  Definitely recommended!",5,Definitely one of my favorite anime series to be released in 2012!,1354320000,"12 1, 2012",2012,9571,"['girls', 'Sakuragaoka', 'Girl', 'High', 'School', 'Light', 'Music',

The band also takes a school trip to Kyoto, and makes a $5,000 profit off selling Ms. Yamanaka's old SG. That's a lot of money for a piece of junk. This season is more of the same.

That is what makes it so endearing.This is a great collection. It contains the first 13 episodes of season 2.
