If nothing else you can always fast forward thru that bit. My son loved this movie but has since moved on (now three and immersed in Peter Pan as well as Jake and the Neverland Pirates). I miss watching this movie with him and have tried to re-introduce it but he isn't there yet. I am sure it will come around again. I really enjoyed this one. Falling asleep together in the recliner while listening to the peaceful songs. Animation is well done as are the songs and voice acting. Yes there is a bit of a scare at the end but it isn't violent and isn't as intense as some seam to think - but again, if my kid had been traumatized I would feel as they do, but he wasn't.... terrific film so don't be scared away....",5,Very Warm film for young children.,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,846,"['Yes', 'scary', 'scene', 'two', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'was', 'fine', 'guess', 'everythiig', 'else', 'really', 'child', 'nothing', 'else', 'can', 'always', 'fast', 'forward', 'thru', 'bit', 'son', 'loved', 'movie', 'moved', 'now', 'three', 'immersed', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'as', 'well', 'Jake', 'Neverland', 'Pirates', 'miss', 'watching', 'movie', 'have', 'tried', 're-introduce', ""n't"", 'there', 'yet', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'come', 'around', 'again', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'Falling', 'asleep', 'together', 'recliner', 'listening', 'peaceful', 'songs', 'Animation', 'well', 'done', 'are', 'songs', 'voice', 'acting', 'bit', 'scare', 'end', ""n't"", 'violent', ""n't"", 'as', 'intense', 'seam', 'think', 'again', 'kid', 'had', 'been', 'traumatized', 'would', 'feel', 'do', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrific', 'film', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'scared', 'away']",N/A

My 3-yr-old has never cried like that at a movie and my 6-year-old keeps talking about the ""night train"" and how scared he is now and that we need to tell the people at the library about this so they know this scary thing is in their movie. Most kids who are interested in seeing this movie will be Thomas Tank-engine aged which is pretty darn young. Kids at this age still can't distinguish well enough between fantasy and reality, so I don't believe it's a good idea to show them such frightening images.",1,Ugh...I wish I'd read the reviews,1348531200,"09 25, 2012",2012,559,"['really', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'let', 'kids', 'watch', 'movie', '3-yr-old', 'never', 'cried', 'movie', '6-year-old', 'keeps', 'talking', 'night', 'train', 'how', 'scared', 'now', 'need', 'tell', 'people', 'library', 'so', 'know', 'scary', 'thing', 'movie', 'Most', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'seeing', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'Thomas', 'Tank-engine', 'aged', 'pretty', 'darn', 'young', 'Kids', 'age', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'distinguish', 'well', 'enough', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'good', 'idea', 'show', 'such', 'frightening', 'images']",N/A
1410247,A3BBY3CZ5IWPGX,B004HYK25I,David N. Self,"[1, 1]",This is a great animated story about the little engine that could.  My 4 year old foster child really liked the story but came running to me when the Nightmare Train showed up.  He was really scared of the gruff sounding engine.  He has asked to see it many times and I have just about memorized the vocals.  Great art work and a wonderful inspiring story.  If we all really try hard at making a life in this tough world we would all benefit. We really can do more if we only try.  Thanks to all for a great video.,5,I think I can!,1327881600,"01 30, 2012",2012,514,"['great', 'animated', 'story', 'little', 'engine', 'could', 'My', '4', 'year', 'old', 'foster', 'child', 'really', 'liked', 'story', 'came', 'running', 'when', 'Nightmare', 'Train', 'showed', 'up', 'was', 'really', 'scared', 'gruff', 'sounding', 'engine', 'asked', 'see', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'just', 'about', 'memorized', 'vocals', 'Great', 'art', 'work', 'wonderful', 'inspiring', 'story', 'really', 'try', 'hard', 'making', 'life', 'tough', 'world', 'would', 'benefit', 'really', 'can', 'do', 'more', 'only', 'try', 'Thanks', 'great', 'video']",N/A

1410249,A3UZFB2LEZYWCT,B004HYK25I,"JLL ""jamesndir""","[2, 3]","The voices in this movie are superb and really fit the characters well.  The story is a very nice adaptation of the old stand-by book.  The trains are responsible for carrying what children wish for form their ""Dream land"" to the real world.  A boy who was just the victim of bullying is accidentally carried by a train into the dream world and lots of things start to go wrong.  Learning to believe in themselves the Little Engine ends up helping the boys and some toys stranded by a broken train get to the real world.  It is funny and a nice story.  The other reviewers are right on about the ""bad guy.""  This is the nightmare train who wants to keep the boy in dream land so the other ""good"" trains can't make good dreams come true but he can continue to bring his nightmares.  The train is charcoal colored and has red eyes and the front ""cow catcher"" are his teeth.  The character would scare most toddlers and a fair number of preschoolers depending on their comfort level.  Certainly seems like the movie would be fine for 4 year olds and up.  Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with the voices, the story, overall message and really enjoyed this as did my children.
