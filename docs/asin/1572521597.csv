There's something seriously wrong with the soundtrack; the dialog elements are drowned out by the music, and there's a synchronization problem that often leaves the left and right channel staggered by about half a second.  Even more distracting, added sound effects often come from the wrong channel compared to the supposed visual source of the sound.My guess is that instead of using a properly mixed mono soundtrack, Fox Lorber went back to the multi-channel master tapes for the mono soundtrack and used them as a fake stereo master -- but did a really bad job on the mix.Whatever the technical explanation, it ruined my enjoyment of the movie.",3,"A wonderful movie, an awful DVD",999993600,"09 9, 2001",2001,739,"[""'d"", 'give', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'problem', 'DVD', 'release', 'Fox', 'Lorber', 'awful', 'something', 'seriously', 'wrong', 'soundtrack', 'dialog', 'elements', 'are', 'drowned', 'out', 'music', 'synchronization', 'problem', 'often', 'left', 'right', 'channel', 'staggered', 'second', 'Even', 'more', 'distracting', 'added', 'sound', 'effects', 'often', 'come', 'wrong', 'channel', 'compared', 'supposed', 'visual', 'source', 'sound.My', 'guess', 'instead', 'using', 'properly', 'mixed', 'mono', 'soundtrack', 'Fox', 'Lorber', 'went', 'back', 'multi-channel', 'master', 'tapes', 'mono', 'soundtrack', 'used', 'fake', 'stereo', 'master', 'did', 'really', 'bad', 'job', 'mix.Whatever', 'technical', 'explanation', 'ruined', 'enjoyment', 'movie']",Meantime VHS

Leigh doesn't simply record the monumental, faceless, soulless tenements and urban environment that dwarf his characters, as a social-realist would: he allows them to shape his narrative, a rigid, static series of concrete tableaux.  Leigh doesn't reduce his characters to caricature, as he's often accused of - Thatcherism does, by removing all those things (hope, work, dreams etc.) that mark humanity and individuality.  As bitterly angry and funny as 'Naked'.",4,"This should be a period piece - depressingly, it isn't.",988329600,"04 27, 2001",2001,578,"['Portentousness', 'contrivances', 'misogyny', 'aside', 'modernist', 'masterpiece', 'closer', 'Antonioni', 'Loach', 'Leigh', ""n't"", 'simply', 'record', 'monumental', 'faceless', 'soulless', 'tenements', 'urban', 'environment', 'dwarf', 'characters', 'social-realist', 'would', 'shape', 'narrative', 'rigid', 'static', 'series', 'concrete', 'tableaux', 'Leigh', ""n't"", 'reduce', 'characters', 'caricature', 'often', 'accused', 'Thatcherism', 'removing', 'things', 'hope', 'work', 'dreams', 'etc', 'mark', 'humanity', 'individuality', 'bitterly', 'angry', 'funny', ""'Naked""]",Meantime VHS

All three men in the household are out of work and drive each other crazy when they aren't nursing their wounded pride with drink or petty criticisms. One son in the household, Colin, has built a life out of keeping his head down because he lacks the wit to compete intellectually. His brother Mark loves him but is jealous of any attention his brother receives so he alternates between bucking him up and tearing him down. Most of the acting is excellent and there is no denouement, sentimental focus, or social argument in it.

186006,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,1572521597,Robert J. Crawford,"[0, 0]","Rather than a story, this film is impressionistic, moving from scene to scene in random sequence with sudden sharp focus.  The characters and acting - just look at the debut performances in the cast! - are extremely good, as are the comedic situations of the depressed unemployed going nowhere.  Oldman is a dumb skinhead.  Tim Roth is a dim-witted younger brother, devoid of ambition and self esteem; his older brother is a lazy cynic, also with no future.  The father and mother despise them, yet do nothing to change anything.  Molino is a long-suffering relative who works and is bored with his marriage to a rather nice alcoholic.While I am a fan of Mike Leigh, this early effort is clearly before he has honed his storytelling skills, who will become first rate in such films as Life is Sweet or Secrets and Lies.  It is worth a look, but I would not recommend buying it.",3,"rambling, strange, plotless take on Thatcher's England",1313020800,"08 11, 2011",2011,877,"['Rather', 'story', 'film', 'impressionistic', 'moving', 'scene', 'scene', 'random', 'sequence', 'sudden', 'sharp', 'focus', 'characters', 'acting', 'just', 'look', 'debut', 'cast', 'are', 'extremely', 'good', 'are', 'comedic', 'situations', 'depressed', 'unemployed', 'going', 'nowhere', 'Oldman', 'dumb', 'skinhead', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'dim-witted', 'younger', 'brother', 'devoid', 'ambition', 'self', 'esteem', 'older', 'brother', 'lazy', 'cynic', 'also', 'future', 'father', 'mother', 'despise', 'yet', 'do', 'nothing', 'change', 'anything', 'Molino', 'long-suffering', 'relative', 'who', 'bored', 'marriage', 'rather', 'nice', 'am', 'fan', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'early', 'effort', 'clearly', 'before', 'honed', 'storytelling', 'skills', 'who', 'will', 'become', 'first', 'rate', 'such', 'films', 'Life', 'Sweet', 'Secrets', 'Lies', 'look', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'buying']",Meantime VHS
186007,A2N46J4SPXJ09U,1572521597,Robert Stribley,"[12, 13]","If you've any doubt of the difference between English and American cultures, watch this early Mike Leigh flick and then think about the fact that it was made for television.  The writing in this dark little number is  better than that of most of the movies released over here, let alone  anything American-made you'll ever see on television.These are dark  character sketches, and I too was reminded of Leigh's Naked as watched,  though this movie doesn't share so much of Naked's explicit philosophizing.  It does share similarly benighted characters, however, and a central  character with the same shiftless way and easy ability to say whatever pops  into his head.Phil Daniels portrays this character, Mark, the story's  wise fool: he knows enough to understand his situation is a horrible one;  he's quite adept at analyzing whatever goes on around him, and he's  revolted by it; but he does little to extricate himself from the situation;  his attitude reflects that of most in the film, expect perhaps for his aunt  who is always somewhat futilely trying to adjust the status quo.Mark and  his brother Colin and their father (who looks perfectly like an older Phil  Daniels) are all on the dole, along with Gary Oldman's character Coxy.As  Mark's half-witted brother, Tim Roth really steals the show; he's so deep  into his part, it's easy to forget he's acting.  The character development  in this story belongs mainly to Roth's character and though the movie seems  to start out focusing equally on all involved, events gradually accumulate  to have the greatest effect upon him.  Interaction especially with Coxy and  his brother stirs him to life and the consequences are both amusing and  touching.  Some viewers won't be happy with the ending--the change may not  be profound enough for them--but the change is there and it's a sign of  inward struggle, a slight pulsing signal of hope .Kudos also to Marion  Bailey who plays the boys' mother.  Her role is not a particularly  sympathetic one, but in one striking scene when she plays hurt, your heart  goes out to this woman anyway.  You understand that beneath her surly  exterior there's a woman needing affection from her sons.Often amusing  and surprisingly touching despite its torpid atmosphere, this cunningly  simple movie is most greatly enrichened by its characters, many of whom  will stay with me for quite some time.(Footnote: As I watched Naked, I  thought that Mike Leigh may be the only director qualified to make a film  of Martin Amis's London Fields; Meantime confirms his qualifications for  me.)",4,Time Keeps On Slipping,963273600,"07 11, 2000",2000,2580,"[""'ve"", 'doubt', 'difference', 'English', 'American', 'cultures', 'watch', 'early', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'flick', 'then', 'think', 'fact', 'was', 'made', 'television', 'writing', 'dark', 'little', 'number', 'better', 'most', 'movies', 'released', 'here', 'let', 'alone', 'anything', 'American-made', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'television.These', 'are', 'dark', 'character', 'sketches', 'too', 'was', 'reminded', 'Leigh', 'Naked', 'watched', 'movie', ""n't"", 'share', 'so', 'much', 'Naked', 'explicit', 'philosophizing', 'share', 'similarly', 'benighted', 'characters', 'however', 'central', 'character', 'same', 'shiftless', 'way', 'easy', 'ability', 'say', 'pops', 'head.Phil', 'Daniels', 'character', 'Mark', 'story', 'wise', 'fool', 'enough', 'understand', 'situation', 'horrible', 'one', 'quite', 'adept', 'analyzing', 'revolted', 'little', 'extricate', 'situation', 'attitude', 'most', 'film', 'expect', 'perhaps', 'aunt', 'who', 'always', 'somewhat', 'futilely', 'trying', 'adjust', 'status', 'quo.Mark', 'brother', 'Colin', 'father', 'who', 'perfectly', 'older', 'Phil', 'Daniels', 'are', 'dole', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'character', 'Coxy.As', 'Mark', 'half-witted', 'brother', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'really', 'show', 'so', 'deep', 'part', 'easy', 'forget', 'acting', 'character', 'development', 'story', 'mainly', 'Roth', 'character', 'movie', 'start', 'out', 'focusing', 'equally', 'involved', 'events', 'gradually', 'accumulate', 'have', 'greatest', 'effect', 'Interaction', 'especially', 'Coxy', 'brother', 'stirs', 'life', 'consequences', 'are', 'amusing', 'touching', 'viewers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'happy', 'ending', 'change', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'profound', 'enough', 'change', 'there', 'sign', 'inward', 'struggle', 'slight', 'pulsing', 'signal', 'hope', '.Kudos', 'also', 'Marion', 'Bailey', 'who', 'boys', 'mother', 'role', 'not', 'particularly', 'sympathetic', 'one', 'one', 'striking', 'scene', 'when', 'hurt', 'heart', 'out', 'woman', 'anyway', 'understand', 'beneath', 'surly', 'exterior', 'woman', 'needing', 'affection', 'sons.Often', 'amusing', 'surprisingly', 'touching', 'torpid', 'atmosphere', 'cunningly', 'simple', 'movie', 'most', 'greatly', 'enrichened', 'characters', 'many', 'whom', 'will', 'stay', 'quite', 'time', 'Footnote', 'watched', 'Naked', 'thought', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'director', 'qualified', 'make', 'film', 'Martin', 'Amis', 'London', 'Fields', 'Meantime', 'qualifications']",Meantime VHS
