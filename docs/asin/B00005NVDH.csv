It would eventually return to the spotlight. Then in 1998 the first movie ""The Rugrats Movie"" came out. The movie introduced Dil whom was unquestionably cute (although he's a bit of an attention hogging crybaby). Dil has to be my favorite rugrat (next to Tommy). Then in 2000 a second movie was released ""Rugrats in Paris"". Kimi (Chuckie's new step-sister) and Kira (Kimi's mom and Chuckie's new stepmother) were introduced. In my opinion, the addition of these 3 characters helped the show to grow and become extremely popular among kids. I thought the spin-off ""All Grown Up"" was OK.

670581,A1JJ2MHN7S4QQH,B00005NVDH,John V,"[2, 2]","""Rugrats"" is a favorite of mine from my childhood. Every now and then I watch re-runs on that popular block on TeenNick called ""The 90's Are All That."" First off, the way this DVD is put together is very dated. It's from 2001 and was released to commemorate the 10th anniversary of ""Rugrats."" The show is now 23 years old and the seasons have been released as Amazon exclusives. The season sets are too overpriced for me though but finding this DVD for a cheap price is all I need (and maybe a couple other compilations). I remember seeing all of these episodes on Nickelodeon back in the day. I especially liked that it had the Vacation special. You won't be seeing the original intro. Instead it's the intro from the later seasons and there are intervals in-between each episode talking about the next episode. I only wish they included more episodes, but you also get a bonus...the unaired pilot episode, which was a treat for me. You also get two dated but classic music videos that were shown on Nickelodeon back in the mid 90's along with short clips from other episodes that weren't included on this DVD. Definitely worth it if you just want a simple list of episodes of ""Rugrats"" just for nostalgic purposes.",4,"Outdated DVD, but Great Episodes",1380240000,"09 27, 2013",2013,1216,"['Rugrats', 'favorite', 'mine', 'childhood', 'now', 'then', 'watch', 're-runs', 'popular', 'block', 'TeenNick', 'called', '90', 'Are', 'All', 'That', 'First', 'off', 'way', 'DVD', 'put', 'together', 'very', 'dated', '2001', 'was', 'released', 'commemorate', '10th', 'anniversary', 'Rugrats', 'show', 'now', '23', 'years', 'old', 'seasons', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'Amazon', 'season', 'sets', 'are', 'too', 'overpriced', 'finding', 'DVD', 'cheap', 'price', 'need', 'maybe', 'couple', 'other', 'compilations', 'remember', 'seeing', 'episodes', 'Nickelodeon', 'back', 'day', 'especially', 'liked', 'had', 'Vacation', 'special', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'seeing', 'original', 'intro', 'Instead', 'intro', 'later', 'seasons', 'are', 'intervals', 'in-between', 'episode', 'talking', 'next', 'episode', 'only', 'wish', 'included', 'more', 'episodes', 'also', 'get', 'bonus', 'unaired', 'pilot', 'episode', 'was', 'treat', 'also', 'get', 'two', 'dated', 'classic', 'music', 'videos', 'were', 'shown', 'Nickelodeon', 'back', 'mid', '90', 'short', 'clips', 'other', 'episodes', 'were', ""n't"", 'included', 'DVD', 'Definitely', 'just', 'want', 'simple', 'list', 'episodes', 'Rugrats', 'just', 'nostalgic', 'purposes']",N/A

All of the episodes in this special disc range from seasons 2 to 7, according to the season sets now available from Amazon, but with slightly-edited prints of Vacation & Finsterella, since they were whole 22-minute episodes without being called 2-parters, in the case of the Valentine special. But sadly, this disc contains things not found in any season set; bonus features, especially the rarely-seen pilot episode! Other bonuses include clips from 10 other episodes from seasons 2 to 7 that weren't in the countdown, the Pickles Family Photo Album short, and 2 old Rugrats music videos from Nick in the 1990's. You might as well get this disc to accompany the season sets, movie trilogy and/or Tales From The Crib DVDs, mainly for the bonus features since they're not in any other DVD, and this whole thing being a time capsule from bygone eras in Nick history and technological history; it's a wonder Decade in Diapers on DVD still being made & sold brand-new today! The 2 VHS volumes of this collection contain Retromercials & a long, old Nick jingle before the feature presentations got started, that aren't on the single DVD. For the bonus features' sake, don't hesitate to add this time capsule to your Rugrats DVD collection today, unless you've done it LONG ago and still have yours.
