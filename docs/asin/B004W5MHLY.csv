This is a classic example of how the story of this movie has actual potential.  However, the amazingly awful acting (as well as substandard writing) ruin the entire affair.  For those who are hoping for a solid patriotic type movie, will get the patriotic part in this movie, but will have to suffer through high school level acting (and writing).2.

It amazes me when you read comments like, ""Poor acting...turned off after 10 minutes...skip this dud.""  :) Then you read the other 17 reviews of people that actually watched the movie..This is a great movie...with an unexpected twist or two...in fact the end ill take you by storm. This ""dud"" made me laugh, cheer and cry.  If you love your country...if you love God or you are struggling with your faith (which is most of us) and you like tender movies about family...THEN BUY THIS MOVIE TODAY!Quit crying about poor acting...the worst actor is Arnold Schwarzenegger (Hercules in New York (1970).) and you still go watch him...lol  Why?  Because sometimes we see a movie for more than a stars abilities.  :)",5,For the love of our country & God watch this movie.,1370304000,"06 4, 2013",2013,782,"['right', 'said', 'God', 'movie', 'Faith', 'family', 'Country', 'when', 'read', 'comments', 'Poor', 'acting', 'turned', 'off', '10', 'minutes', 'skip', 'dud', 'Then', 'read', 'other', '17', 'reviews', 'people', 'actually', 'watched', 'movie..This', 'great', 'movie', 'unexpected', 'twist', 'two', 'fact', 'end', 'ill', 'take', 'storm', 'dud', 'made', 'cheer', 'cry', 'love', 'country', 'love', 'God', 'are', 'struggling', 'faith', 'most', 'tender', 'movies', 'family', 'THEN', 'BUY', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'TODAY', 'Quit', 'crying', 'poor', 'acting', 'worst', 'actor', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Hercules', 'New', 'York', '1970', 'still', 'go', 'watch', 'lol', 'Why', 'sometimes', 'see', 'movie', 'more', 'stars', 'abilities']",Flag Of My Father

1430392,AIH35QDMJEJK0,B004W5MHLY,J Book,"[1, 1]","This has to be one of the very best movies in years!  It sneaks up on you. The movie leads you into conclusions you were supposed to make only to turn 180 degrees and then ...even then you're wrong.To call this a feel good movie is not accurate.  It is that plus a great acting movie. It is great plot, scripted movie.  All the actors surprise you at one time or another... ALL of them, do you hear?  Even John S. tosses some curve balls.My son is a lifer in the military.... that is NOT why I love this flick.... I feel so connected to it because the writers and the actors, (should I include the director), got everything to work together and up popped a movie my wife and I will never forget.  The movie is presented in a neither Right or Left view of the military....it is balanced and often worldly.It has world view. It has Christian view.  It has military view.  You will do good for yourself to watch and re-watch this movie.Come-on, I dare you!!!!  Do something excellent for you, your family and your friends.",5,Almost speechless for this........,1315094400,"09 4, 2011",2011,1019,"['be', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'movies', 'years', 'up', 'movie', 'conclusions', 'were', 'supposed', 'make', 'only', 'turn', '180', 'degrees', 'then', 'even', 'then', ""'re"", 'wrong.To', 'call', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'accurate', 'great', 'acting', 'movie', 'great', 'plot', 'scripted', 'movie', 'actors', 'surprise', 'one', 'time', 'do', 'hear', 'Even', 'John', 'S.', 'curve', 'balls.My', 'son', 'lifer', 'military', 'NOT', 'why', 'love', 'flick', 'feel', 'so', 'connected', 'writers', 'actors', 'should', 'include', 'director', 'got', 'everything', 'work', 'together', 'up', 'popped', 'movie', 'wife', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'movie', 'presented', 'neither', 'Right', 'Left', 'view', 'military', '.it', 'balanced', 'often', 'worldly.It', 'world', 'view', 'Christian', 'view', 'military', 'view', 'will', 'do', 'good', 'watch', 're-watch', 'movie.Come-on', 'dare', 'Do', 'something', 'excellent', 'family', 'friends']",Flag Of My Father
1430393,A1ZSWL641H5018,B004W5MHLY,"Marie44 ""marie44""","[6, 6]","We watched this movie last night on Memorial Day, and it is the kind of movie that should be watched on that day. The acting was really good and the plot was great.A woman has a close bond with her stepfather because they both served in the military. Her four stepbrothers are jealous of that relationship, and their jealousy keeps them even further from their biological father. When the man dies, just before the opportunity of his sons to know him better, all the hidden anger and resentment comes out as they are later arguing about who should have the flag that was presented at the funeral.The stepbrothers make it clear to their stepsister that they don't think much of her military service, saying she wasn't a soldier since she was ""only"" a nurse. Then, through flashbacks of her military service, we learn what she really did in the military and those are the most heartrending parts of the movie. The woman and her husband go to a counselor to help the woman with her PTSD and she relives those times all over again. Those scenes, from the enemy attacks to what happens when the woman and another soldier go through a horrific ordeal, are some of the most intense and well-acted I've ever seen in a military-themed film.The only things I didn't like about the movie were some of the sudden transitions, such as when we find out some of people in the family were in a car accident. But, really, the acting in this movie is so good that it is hardly noticeable and doesn't detract from the high quality of the acting or the story.I loved how it was all brought together at the end--how someone from the woman's past was going to help heal the anger and resentment of the brothers, and that they finally learned to honor those who give military service, as should be done. It also makes good points about how hurtful judging without knowledge can be and how important it is to show others love before it's too late.",5,Very thought-provoking and poignant movie,1306800000,"05 31, 2011",2011,1923,"['watched', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'Memorial', 'Day', 'kind', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'day', 'acting', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'plot', 'was', 'great.A', 'woman', 'close', 'bond', 'stepfather', 'served', 'military', 'four', 'stepbrothers', 'are', 'jealous', 'relationship', 'jealousy', 'even', 'further', 'biological', 'father', 'When', 'man', 'just', 'opportunity', 'sons', 'know', 'better', 'hidden', 'anger', 'resentment', 'out', 'are', 'later', 'arguing', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'flag', 'was', 'presented', 'funeral.The', 'stepbrothers', 'make', 'clear', 'stepsister', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'military', 'service', 'saying', 'was', ""n't"", 'soldier', 'was', 'only', 'nurse', 'Then', 'flashbacks', 'military', 'service', 'learn', 'what', 'really', 'did', 'military', 'are', 'most', 'heartrending', 'parts', 'movie', 'woman', 'husband', 'go', 'counselor', 'help', 'woman', 'PTSD', 'times', 'over', 'again', 'scenes', 'enemy', 'what', 'when', 'woman', 'soldier', 'go', 'horrific', 'ordeal', 'are', 'most', 'intense', 'well-acted', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'military-themed', 'film.The', 'only', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'were', 'sudden', 'transitions', 'such', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'people', 'family', 'were', 'car', 'accident', 'really', 'acting', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'hardly', 'noticeable', ""n't"", 'detract', 'high', 'quality', 'acting', 'story.I', 'loved', 'how', 'was', 'brought', 'together', 'end', 'how', 'someone', 'woman', 'past', 'was', 'going', 'help', 'heal', 'anger', 'resentment', 'brothers', 'finally', 'learned', 'honor', 'who', 'give', 'military', 'service', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'also', 'good', 'points', 'how', 'hurtful', 'judging', 'knowledge', 'can', 'be', 'how', 'important', 'show', 'others', 'too', 'late']",Flag Of My Father
