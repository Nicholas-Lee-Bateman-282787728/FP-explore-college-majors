It is a good workout but there are alot of changes during the routines.  I wish there was a bit more repitition versus the quick changes that take place.

958654,A1Y3WG8FGYPXDA,B000CFX794,globalcook,"[15, 15]","This is one of my favorite Richard Simmons DVDs.  It lasts about 50 minutes, about 45 minutes of which is aerobics/dance.  The songs are from the 80s.  I could have done without Like a Virgin, though the rest of them were good.  One thing I like about Richard is that he doesn't teach the steps.  So at first, it takes a bit of time to get things figured out.  But in the long run it's so much nicer to not have to ""review"" the steps every time you use the DVD.  This is a pretty good workout; I always break a sweat early on.  Beginners can modify the steps or arm movements if they want.  I added wrist weights today to get a more intense workout.  One thing I love about Richard Simmons is that he makes exercising fun.  I don't like to exercise, but I do because I need to.  Once I start a Richard Simmons DVD I get into it right away.  Richard is encouraging and he surrounds himself with ordinary people wearing pretty much ordinary clothes.",5,Fun way to exercise,1186531200,"08 8, 2007",2007,947,"['one', 'favorite', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'DVDs', '50', 'minutes', '45', 'minutes', 'aerobics/dance', 'songs', 'are', '80s', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Virgin', 'rest', 'were', 'good', 'One', 'thing', 'like', 'Richard', ""n't"", 'teach', 'steps', 'So', 'first', 'bit', 'time', 'get', 'things', 'figured', 'out', 'long', 'run', 'so', 'much', 'nicer', 'not', 'have', 'review', 'steps', 'time', 'use', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'good', 'workout', 'always', 'break', 'sweat', 'early', 'Beginners', 'can', 'modify', 'steps', 'arm', 'movements', 'want', 'added', 'wrist', 'weights', 'today', 'get', 'more', 'intense', 'workout', 'One', 'thing', 'love', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'exercising', 'fun', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'exercise', 'do', 'need', 'Once', 'start', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'DVD', 'get', 'right', 'away', 'Richard', 'encouraging', 'ordinary', 'people', 'wearing', 'pretty', 'much', 'ordinary', 'clothes']",N/A

I had always passed over Richard Simmons because I thought he was just for the very large or very out of shape. I am neither. I am thin for my height and am in pretty good shape. I was looking for something new though and I decided to try it. I love the music and with some moderations (bouncing jumping jacks instead of just keeping the feet low for example) this workout became the best I have done. It kicked on the Crunch series for making me sweat. I really love it except Richard gets a little annoying, I just find him slimey. I also am not a fan of the costumed dancers except maybe the cheerleaders in Mickey, the girls in the dresses dancing in the one song I can't even watch as Richard ""meows"" at one of them and I just can't handle that. Overall though, I would recommend it, I am getting another one of his DVDs to do.",5,Surprised that I love it!,1206230400,"03 23, 2008",2008,915,"['first', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'DVD', 'may', 'sound', 'bad', 'mean', 'disrespect', 'had', 'always', 'passed', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'very', 'large', 'very', 'shape', 'am', 'am', 'thin', 'height', 'am', 'pretty', 'good', 'shape', 'was', 'looking', 'something', 'new', 'decided', 'try', 'love', 'music', 'moderations', 'bouncing', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'instead', 'just', 'keeping', 'feet', 'low', 'example', 'workout', 'became', 'best', 'have', 'done', 'kicked', 'Crunch', 'series', 'making', 'sweat', 'really', 'love', 'Richard', 'little', 'annoying', 'just', 'find', 'slimey', 'also', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'costumed', 'dancers', 'maybe', 'cheerleaders', 'Mickey', 'girls', 'dresses', 'dancing', 'one', 'song', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'watch', 'Richard', 'meows', 'one', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'Overall', 'would', 'recommend', 'am', 'getting', 'one', 'DVDs', 'do']",N/A
