I don't care if the movie was shot over 18 days for barely $1 million, watching this movie is about as pleasant as licking scrotum sweat off a cadaver. This script should never have been greenlit in the first place, writer James Gunn should have approached Dark Horse or some other indie comic publisher and done a black-and-white graphic novel. It could have been halfway decent in that format and it is a lot easier to sell the superhero stuff in comics than it is in a film without money for special effects.My feeling is you can't make a superhero movie for a mil, I don't care how you're doing it. Never for an instant does anybody believe any of the guys in this movie have any powers. I think it would've made a huge difference if they had shown one or two shots of members of the Specials using their powers early on to establish their cred as heroes, but they don't and it's impossible for the cast to simulate superpowers, no matter how good they are as actors.The annoying thing about this is that you give $1 million bucks and 18 days to a number of directors, they could turn out something pretty special. Kevin Smith made Clerks for $20K for crissakes, and even considering inflation that would've been maybe $60K in 2000, when this was made.Instead, director Craig Mazin and writer Gunn have given us another bottom-of-the-barrel superhero movie, as if we needed another one of those.It just goes to show how bass ackwards Hollywood can be--if these guys worked in any other business and this was the work they produced, they would be abruptly fired and unable to ever work again in that industry. But the movie business doesn't seem to care whether their products are any good, hence Mazin is directing the upcoming ""Superhero!"" and Gunn is writing other gems like Scooby Doo 2.

Only vague memories as one disturbed nerd would shout out to another ""11!"" on some crowded convention floor sparking a limited amount of laughter from those cool enough and often old enough to have actually seen spinal tap. But it seems that ever since James Gunn, the Director of such Awe inspiring noncommercial cult hits such as ""Slither"" and ""Super"", gave us ""The Specials"" the fake reality television movie is everywhere.This Gem written by and starring Gunn can be yours now apparently for the super low price of $3.65 as of the publishing of this article. I have three pieces of advice for you 1)BUY 2) BUY 3) BUY. Buy a copy for you, buy a copy for your family and buy a copy all your friends. This movie is sure to please and here are a few reasons why, it is by far the best superhero movie to contain 0 battle scenes, you heard right absolutely no giant superhero battles. Want to know how that is awesome? You're going to have to watch the movie to find out. The wonderful Thomas Haden Church creates in The Great Strobe (AKA Ted) a character every bit as vain, egotistical, fallible and endearing as he did with Jack in ""Sideways"". The rest of the cast including Rob Lowe, Jamie Kennedy and Paget Brewster give wonderful and true performances, there is even a small part featuring John Doe doing what he does best being the invisible character actor who will make you say ""Hey I know that guy, wasn't he in "" Pure Country""?"". If you look really careful you will even see early and hilarious performances by Judy Greer, Jordan Ladd, Chase Masterson and Melissa Joan Hart. You'll find yourself laughing along and at even those Specials who fell into obscurity never to be seen or heard from again. I have been a fan of this movie ever since seeing it at an early screening at Comic-Con directly in front of Lloyd Kaufman of (of Troma fame) and believe me he laughed.

The Specials, comprised of the sixth or seventh greatest superhero team in the world, need to improve their image. Unfortunately, they spend more time bickering about love affairs, finances and publicity, then they do catching Super Villains. However, The Specials' luck may soon change The Weevil (Rob Lowe), The Strobe (Thomas Hadden Church), Amok (Jamie Kennedy) and the rest of the The Specials hope to gain immortality with their own line of action figures...the superhero equivalent of an Academy Award.I briefly heard about this movie late last year in radio promos. Even then it had sounded interesting. However, when it opened in Manhattan I was sure it would come to my town, but then it was gone. I felt cheated and rightfully so. This is a damn good movie. Now I have to warn you this is not an action movie, there is now spectacular effects, it is about these people, these superheroes lives. Having said that, the movie is a marvel of independant film making. The script shines and the characters remain true to themselves as they would in any good drama, and this, for all intents and purposes is a superhero drama. I found myself enjoying these character's company, and wondered what their lives would be like after the film faded to black.

The story of the sixth most famoussuperhero fighting group in the world. Only though in this world,there's no Supermen, Spider-Men, or any credible hero really.What gets me about this flix is that even with a pretty decentcast, featuring Rob Lowe, pre-Spider-Man 3 Thomas Haden Church, and Jamie Kennedy, along with other recognizable faces, everyone really seems to know on screen just what a disaster they're actually in.Anyway, the group's main desire is to have the ultimate award,their own action figures. But when the action figures turn out tobe cheesy recycled-parts of other less-than-heroic toys, the group falls into dismay. Should I really go on? Maybe I shouldn't but okay, I'll give a spoiler alert here:While you get to see the ""human"" side of superheroes in this flix, you never, I repeat NEVER see the hero side. NO POWERS SHOWN! They don't do anything! They talk alot, but if it wasn't for Kennedy's decent Nightcrawler rip-off make-up, you couldn't tell this was a hero flix in the first place. A lot of whining, alot of moaning, but even if this was supposed to be satire on films like this, they completely missed the point. Hard to believe that this film was written by the same guy that wrote 2004's Dawn Of The Dead, produced by the team that gave us the excellent Clerks-like Free Enterprise, and how interesting, the director of '08's Superhero Movie, yet another attempt at paroding this genre. Hope he gets it right this time.To sum up, I blind-bought this at a Dollar General, new mind you, for $3 and it's worth that much. Mostly a boring disaster, but has a couple of saving graces, like it's commentary with star/screenwriter Gunn telling how everyone but himself turned his dream movie into such a mess (did he read what he wrote?).

This is a film about the personal lives and neuroses of superheroes. To begin with there is some entertainment value to the idea of superheroes swearing, smoking and generally misbehaving, but this evaporates by about the middle of the film when it becomes apparent that that is all we are going to see. There is no super-villain to this story. All of the ""dramatic tension"" in this movie comes from disagreements within the group itself, which means that there are no opportunities for the group to show off their super powers and no big fight scene to form the climax to the film. In fact, the film ends with the group going off to fight a group of giant ants, but we are never shown the fight. The only scene in the film that shows anything other than talk is a ""spontaneous"" dance scene in a bar, but even this feels contrived. It is as if it were inserted because that is the sort of thing that is ""meant"" to appear in a film like this, rather than because it is naturally the right thing to happen.

I only managed to unearth it in a Blockbusters store, buried under some dvds on sale for $6. Having been a lifelong fan of superheroes, and finding the movie premise somewhat intriguing, I took a chance and bought it. And I'm glad I did.First of all, this is not your average superhero comic book on cinema. If you pop this in your player, expecting a whiff of X-men type of action and carnage, you'll be hugely disappointed. This film more closely resembles Mystery Men in terms of its cynical, sad sack comedy and wicked digs at the superhero mythology. Mystery Men, if I recall, focused more on the personal foibles of the ""heroes"" than on actual superheroing. The Specials have even less action - in fact, it has NO action scenes. What it does, instead, is unfold a villain-free day-in-the-life of the Specials.The plot, as such: The Specials are a bush-league, second-string superhero team, considered the 6th or 7th greatest superhero team around. The team comprises of 12 or 19 members (there is a superhero named 8 - one mind in 8 bodies) and is led by the preachy goody-goody Strobe (Thomas Haden Church). On the verge of getting their own line of Kosgro action figures, the supers fall prey to incessant bickering, which culminates in the break-up of the Specials. Now the disbanded members find themselves rudderless and must do some soul searching and decide on what they really want:  go their own separate ways, or come to terms with each other and once more become Special.This is a low budget film with a semi-indie feel. This flick is also a spoof. It has plenty of satiric elements. It's a ""superhero"" movie without many special effects (the few f/x we see are at the end, and, brother, do they suck!) But, it doesn't matter. The point never was about the gratuitous spectacular fight scenes, but, rather, the humanizing ""behind-the-story"" aspects of our masked vigilantes. This picture goes on to show that, underneath the trappings of the glossy superhero veneer, these gifted folks are still inevitably, fallibly human and definitely not error-proof. The viewer is witness to greed, rivalries, jealousies, an extramarital affair, and the misfit deportment of super-nerds, -idiots, and -weirdos. It also makes sense that if superheroes did exist, they'd try to rake in their share of commercial endorsements, corporate sponsorships, and news pub. That's the way of the world, love. Most supers, in my opinion, would strive to ""get theirs.""I find the acting to be very good and appropriate for this genre spin. The three main leads (Church, Brewster, and Lowe) do their best with their roles. Church's the Strobe is self-righteous and humorless until he gets the shock of the night, and then sorta comes around. Paget Brewster (guest starred in tv's Friends) is the Strobe's discontented wife Emily (Ms. Indestructible). Paget puts real emotion into her portrayal, ably communicating Emily's dissatisfaction with life and then grief over her transgressions. I think Rob Lowe does credible work as Tony, the Weevil, the most charismatic and popular member of the team. I'll say this, I was semi-stunned with the choice and choice words the Weevil ends up with at the end of the film.The supporting cast is all-around awesome: Judy Greer (13 Going on 30) as the snide, bitchy, yet faithful friend Deadly Girl; Sean Gunn as Doug, the very weird green alien orphan; Jamie Kennedy as the filthy-mouthed blue-hued ex-supervillain Amok; and Jordan Ladd as the sweet, naive Nightbird, the newest member imbued with dubious bird powers.This movie has some funny bits in it, such as the Strobe freaking out after watching the tv promo spot of his team's line of toys, and slow thinker U.S. Bill showing new rookie Nightbird around the headquarters. Or the Strobe reminiscing with an ex-team mate: ""How about the time we captured and drained the Amazing Blister?"" But the bits I found funniest are the comments spat out by the profane Amok, who cusses with sailorlike regularity. He tells the touchy-feely Power Chick: ""You're 12-stepping me to death, b***h!"" To counteract that, look out for a touching, feel good scene involving dancing on a club stage.The special features has 2 audio commentaries (one by writer/actor James Gunn and actress Paget Brewster, the other by director Craig Mazin, the producer, the visual effects supervisor, and again writer/actor James Gunn), deleted scenes, a Wedding Video, a trailer, and behind-the-scenes photos.",4,"""Not

I didn't realize that this movie was made in 1999 until after I watch it, and from that perspective it still hold up after more than 10 years and could possibly be timeless.  The concept is different from a lot of other superhero movies.  Specials takes a look at the down time and internal politics of a superhero team.  It starts off well, but if feels like it ran out of money towards the end especially because of the bad CG special effects.  However, I can forgive that because CG was much, much more difficult and expensive in 1999.  Some of the character concepts are very intriguing, especially 8, the man with 1 mind and 8 bodies.
