45584,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,0783214243,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[3, 3]","One of Adam Sandler's best movies, Billy Madison is the absolutely hilarious film that sparked Sandler's long reign as a romantic comedy box office draw. Exhibiting a sharp wit, combined with a touch of sensitivity for the fairer sex, the former Saturday Night Live standout successfully distances himself from the lewd and crude comedy path and creates a nice medium between outrageous and lighthearted comedy. It's a path he would later follow with box office hits Happy Gilmore, The Wedding Singer, The Waterboy, and Mr. Deeds. In Billy Madison, he follows that same path to perfection...Billy Madison follows the life of a character by the same name (Adam Sandler) - a 27-year-old unemployed heir to a hotel fortune who lacks all ambition. The opening scenes capture Billy lying by the pool with his friends, hungover and completely out of his mind, and they set the tone for a movie filled with humorous antics and great one-liners. But Billy's life of laziness is turned upside down, when his father (Darren McGavin) decides that he's going to retire from running his multimillion dollar hotel empire. He appoints his arrogant and condescending assistant Eric Gordon (Bradley Whitford) as heir apparent. The appointment comes as a shock to Billy who thought he would automatically inherit the reigns upon his father's retirement. But when Billy's father reveals that he paid all of Billy's teachers from kindergarten to high school to give his son a passing grade, the young man begins to understand why. Billy quickly offers a deal to his father that if he can pass grades K-12 all over again, then he will inherit control of the hotel empire after all. His father agrees.As Billy goes through each grade, he meets a number of new friends - mostly third graders. He also falls in love with his beautiful third grade teacher Veronica Vaughn (Bridgette Wilson) who is quick to condemn Billy as a lazy, self-absorbed, screw-up. However, she later recognizes his sensitivity and special way with children, and she develops an interest in him as well. Also interested in Billy is the gay elementary school principal Max Anderson (Josh Mostel). When Eric Gordon sees that Billy is going to successfully pass each grade, he blackmails Principal Anderson. If Anderson doesn't go on TV and tell the world that Billy paid him for a passing grade, he'll tell everyone about Anderson's hidden past as a pro-wrestler named ""The Revolting Blob"" who accidentally killed another wrestler in the ring.When Billy's grade school friends come to his aid, it's determined that Billy and Eric will fight for control of the hotel empire via an ""academic decathlon"". Now, only Billy's wits can win him what he most desires...Billy Madison is a movie with a number of hilarious scenes. In one such scene, a third grader accidentally ""pees his pants"" and is afraid to get on the bus during a field trip. Sandler throws some water on his pants and tells the other children that ""peein' in your pants is cool""! thus saving the child from embarrassment. In another scene, Billy calls ex-classmate Danny McGrath (Steve Buscemi) to apologize for picking on him as a kid. After the phone call, Danny crosses Billy off of his master list of ""people to kill"". Later, Danny comes to Billy's aid.Overall, this is a fun movie. If you like lighthearted comedy with just a touch of outrageous behavior, then you'll enjoy this breakout Adam Sandler hit. Billy Madison won't be found on anyone's list of Academy Award winning all-time great cinema masterpieces, but it's just as entertaining as any film that would be. That's why I rank it as a must-see movie.

45591,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,0783214243,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[13, 16]","Billy Madison is the most hilariously inane character that Adam Sandler has portrayed, and while I don't consider this one of Sandler's best movies, it is easily one of his funniest.  A lot of the comedy seems to have come directly from the set of Saturday Night Live; it was funny there, and it is funny here.  Even a few SNL buddies, namely Norm MacDonald and the late Chris Farley, turn up to revel in the infectiously entertaining silliness.  Sandler plays Billy Madison (of course), the son of a filthy rich hotel magnate.  He spends all of his time lazing around the pool, drinking copious amounts of alcohol, and pawing over nudie mags; his only hobby seems to be lighting bags of poo on fire on the front porch of people he doesn't particularly like.  Even after his infantile behavior at a big business meeting, he is shocked to hear his father say he is giving the company to a particularly annoying executive rather than turning it over to him.  He swears he will do anything, even go back to school and actually earn the diploma his father bought for him, to make his father change his mind.  Monday morning finds him camped out in a first grade classroom, where he actually fits in pretty well.  Every two weeks, he is tested and bumped up another grade.  Billy really enjoys his time in third grade because he makes some good friends among the children and laps the elixir of knowledge from the fountain of the gorgeous Veronica Vaughn (Bridgette Wilson).  As time goes by, Eric starts sweating and sets Billy up for a fall.  Only the disciplinarian love of Veronica and the support of his new childhood friends can pick Billy up and get him back in the game.I think Sandler is a comic genius, and few comedians could make such a silly, silly movie a real success.  I mean, Billy does things like chase imaginary giant penguins around the house; that kind of thing just doesn't fly with any other actors.  I should point out that there is actually a strong human element to this story as it progresses, though.  Once all the alcohol is out of his bloodstream, Billy is a nice, good-hearted fellow, and the reliving of his old school days makes a profound impact on his character.  I'm still not exactly sure what Veronica sees in him, but true success pretty much requires a good-looking woman to be there to kiss you at the end.  Perhaps I should just say a final word to the parents of teenaged boys: while this movie does provide a strategy guaranteed to make any young man study his heart out, it is probably not something you will want to sanction in your own family life.",4,Adam Sandler at his most inane and comical best,1060646400,"08 12, 2003",2003,2591,"['Billy', 'Madison', 'most', 'hilariously', 'inane', 'character', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'portrayed', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'one', 'Sandler', 'best', 'movies', 'easily', 'one', 'funniest', 'lot', 'comedy', 'have', 'come', 'directly', 'set', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'was', 'funny', 'there', 'funny', 'here', 'Even', 'few', 'SNL', 'buddies', 'namely', 'Norm', 'MacDonald', 'late', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'turn', 'up', 'revel', 'infectiously', 'entertaining', 'silliness', 'Sandler', 'Billy', 'Madison', 'course', 'son', 'filthy', 'rich', 'hotel', 'magnate', 'time', 'lazing', 'pool', 'drinking', 'copious', 'amounts', 'alcohol', 'pawing', 'nudie', 'mags', 'only', 'hobby', 'be', 'lighting', 'bags', 'poo', 'fire', 'front', 'porch', 'people', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'like', 'Even', 'infantile', 'behavior', 'big', 'business', 'meeting', 'shocked', 'hear', 'father', 'say', 'giving', 'company', 'particularly', 'annoying', 'executive', 'rather', 'turning', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'even', 'go', 'back', 'school', 'actually', 'earn', 'diploma', 'father', 'bought', 'make', 'father', 'change', 'mind', 'Monday', 'morning', 'camped', 'out', 'first', 'grade', 'classroom', 'where', 'actually', 'pretty', 'well', 'two', 'weeks', 'tested', 'bumped', 'up', 'grade', 'Billy', 'really', 'time', 'third', 'grade', 'good', 'friends', 'children', 'elixir', 'knowledge', 'fountain', 'gorgeous', 'Veronica', 'Vaughn', 'Bridgette', 'Wilson', 'time', 'Eric', 'sweating', 'sets', 'Billy', 'up', 'fall', 'Only', 'disciplinarian', 'love', 'Veronica', 'support', 'new', 'childhood', 'friends', 'can', 'pick', 'Billy', 'up', 'get', 'back', 'game.I', 'think', 'Sandler', 'comic', 'genius', 'few', 'comedians', 'could', 'make', 'such', 'silly', 'silly', 'movie', 'real', 'success', 'mean', 'Billy', 'things', 'chase', 'imaginary', 'giant', 'house', 'kind', 'thing', 'just', ""n't"", 'fly', 'other', 'actors', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'actually', 'strong', 'human', 'element', 'story', 'though', 'Once', 'alcohol', 'bloodstream', 'Billy', 'nice', 'good-hearted', 'fellow', 'reliving', 'old', 'school', 'days', 'profound', 'impact', 'character', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'what', 'Veronica', 'true', 'success', 'pretty', 'much', 'good-looking', 'woman', 'be', 'there', 'kiss', 'end', 'Perhaps', 'should', 'just', 'say', 'final', 'word', 'parents', 'teenaged', 'boys', 'movie', 'provide', 'strategy', 'guaranteed', 'make', 'young', 'man', 'study', 'heart', 'out', 'probably', 'not', 'something', 'will', 'want', 'sanction', 'own', 'family', 'life']",N/A

I didn't like Happy Gilmore. I didn't like Waterboy. I didn't like Mr. Deeds. (Though... I did like the Wedding Singer, but I take that as the exception that proves the rule...) It was to be expected, going in, that I wouldn't like Billy Madison. And, I didn't.But maybe you *are* an Adam Sandler fan, like the friend of mine who convinced me to take this chance on Sandler. If so, you'll probabaly really like this movie (it's his favorite of the Sandler films). I'd say that, if you're a Sandler fan, you can add two stars to my review for a total of four.Sandler is really himself in this film, doing his schtick. For instance, early on he sings a pointless, off-key ode to sunscreen. Sandler fans find that kind of thing funny; I don't. I think that's the barometer for this movie--ask yourself: guy singing about sunscreen, just 'cause. Funny? If so, get this movie.To get into specifics, Billy Madison is about the title character (Sandler), heir to his father's multi-million dollar corporation, who is in danger of losing out on his inheritance because he's uneducated and unmannered and, in general, a big layabout who spends his days sunbathing and drinking (and singing about sunscreen). Billy makes a deal with his dad that the business will go to him if he manages to pass each grade, 1-12, with 2 weeks for each grade. I hope I'm not spoiling too much to say that: Billy wins in the end, gets the girl (a very hot elementary school teacher) and sticks it to the bad guy (an unscrupulous businessman, scheming to ""steal"" the business away from Billy).I found the plot unrealistic. What the hell does it mean to ""pass"" 12th grade in 2 weeks... and more than that, Madison starts out unable to spell the word ""rock"" (his version: ""rok""); do we really believe he could turn that around so quickly? I found Sandler's character inconsistent. One second he's a spastic moron, the next he's a relatively decent, sensitive guy, and there's no real reason to believe they're the same person. I found the humor lame--jokes revolve around ugly homosexuals finding Billy attractive and little kids pissing on themselves.None of this will matter to the Sandler fan, but those on the fence might take note.Some positives include two of the supporting cast--Norm McDonald (who needs to work more) and Chris Farley's brief appearance (who is missed). Also, the teacher/love-interest *is* really hot.Sandler Fans: 4 Stars.Everyone Else: 2 Stars.",2,"A Film for Sandler Fans; Others, Steer Clear",1153785600,"07 25, 2006",2006,2571,"['have', 'understand', 'am', 'not', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'fan', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Waterboy', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'did', 'Wedding', 'Singer', 'take', 'exception', 'rule', 'was', 'be', 'expected', 'going', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'Billy', 'Madison', ""didn't.But"", 'maybe', '*are*', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'fan', 'friend', 'mine', 'who', 'convinced', 'take', 'chance', 'Sandler', 'so', ""'ll"", 'probabaly', 'really', 'movie', 'favorite', 'Sandler', 'films', ""'d"", 'say', ""'re"", 'Sandler', 'fan', 'can', 'add', 'two', 'stars', 'review', 'total', 'four.Sandler', 'really', 'film', 'doing', 'schtick', 'instance', 'early', 'pointless', 'off-key', 'ode', 'sunscreen', 'Sandler', 'fans', 'find', 'kind', 'thing', 'funny', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'barometer', 'movie', 'ask', 'guy', 'singing', 'sunscreen', 'just', 'Funny', 'so', 'get', 'movie.To', 'get', 'specifics', 'Billy', 'Madison', 'title', 'character', 'Sandler', 'heir', 'father', 'multi-million', 'dollar', 'corporation', 'who', 'danger', 'losing', 'out', 'inheritance', 'uneducated', 'unmannered', 'general', 'big', 'layabout', 'who', 'days', 'sunbathing', 'drinking', 'singing', 'sunscreen', 'Billy', 'deal', 'dad', 'business', 'will', 'go', 'pass', 'grade', '1-12', '2', 'weeks', 'grade', 'hope', ""'m"", 'not', 'spoiling', 'too', 'much', 'say', 'Billy', 'end', 'girl', 'very', 'hot', 'elementary', 'school', 'teacher', 'bad', 'guy', 'unscrupulous', 'businessman', 'scheming', 'steal', 'business', 'away', 'Billy', '.I', 'found', 'plot', 'unrealistic', 'What', 'hell', 'mean', 'pass', '12th', 'grade', '2', 'weeks', 'more', 'Madison', 'out', 'unable', 'spell', 'word', 'rock', 'version', 'rok', 'do', 'really', 'believe', 'could', 'turn', 'so', 'quickly', 'found', 'Sandler', 'character', 'inconsistent', 'One', 'second', 'spastic', 'moron', 'next', 'relatively', 'decent', 'sensitive', 'guy', 'real', 'reason', 'believe', ""'re"", 'same', 'person', 'found', 'humor', 'lame', 'jokes', 'revolve', 'ugly', 'homosexuals', 'finding', 'Billy', 'attractive', 'little', 'kids', 'pissing', 'themselves.None', 'will', 'matter', 'Sandler', 'fan', 'fence', 'might', 'take', 'note.Some', 'positives', 'include', 'two', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Norm', 'McDonald', 'who', 'work', 'more', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'brief', 'appearance', 'who', 'missed', 'Also', 'teacher/love-interest', '*is*', 'really', 'Fans', '4', 'Stars.Everyone', 'Else', '2', 'Stars']",N/A
45600,A1TJIJKKN15KR9,0783214243,drqshadow,"[4, 24]","Born right in the heart of the golden era of SNL goofball idiot comedy, this lands somewhere near the middle of the pack in terms of overall watchability. It's a completely moronic premise that serves as nothing more than a thin vehicle to move from one throwaway sight gag to the next, but never has any illusions about evolving into something bigger. The film sticks with its bread and butter, a series of skits that would've been right at home on a particularly brainless episode of SNL, while dedicating as little time as possible to furthering the plot.

After all, who spells Rock ""R-O-K""? Determined that he should take over the family business, Sandler makes a bet with his father that if he goes back to school and scores good grades in each grade in a week (1 grade, 1 week), that he should get to take over the family business.Along with his best friend Norm McDonald and the help of fellow SNL Alumni Chris Farley and of course the help of his classmates and sexy teacher Bridgette Wilson, Sandler makes Billy Madison the most fun and funniest movie that he has on his bill so far.

This seems to be one of his better films. He often seems to play that goofy yet loveable character.  The plot does have that ""movie logic"" premise of the main character having to repeat 1st thru 12th grades in order to inherit his father's hotel empire.Then again I am not looking for absolute realism. Just funny popcorn entertainment, and this movie delivered.There are a lot of funny and touching moments between Sandler and some of the younger kids in the film. Watching it I get the feeling that they all geniunely enjoyed making this movie. Lots of quotable lines (such as the title of my review) and a heartfelt ending make this worth renting. Special shout out to Norm MacDonald for playing one of Billy Madison's slacker friends who is always hanging out with him. Also Bradley Whitford does a good job of playing the character everyone loves to hate. I thought that he looked familiar and then remembered that I had seen him on tv starring in The West Wing.No where else will you see a penguin hallucination, Steve Buscemi and Chris Farley all in the same film. Yet, it works without being over the top. The musical scene is also worth mentioning, as is the homage to the Godfather II scene between Fredo and Michael(where Billy confronts the character of Eric who is trying to stop Billy and control the company).

Honestly has there ever been a better ""dumb"" movie as my boy Kenny calls it. In my eyes it still holds up today with classic lines and one liners that I still fin myself repeating today. Honestly anything with Steve Buscemi, Chris Farley and Norm Macdonald in the same film had to be a classic.The film is about man child Billy Madison who is the son of a very wealthy man so he really doesn't have to do anything but lie around and do nothing. Follow penguins around, magazines and two friends enjoying it all with him, until someone else wants to take over his father's company. It is at that point that Billy decides he must get serious and take care of the family business. His father reuses at first but then agrees that if Billy goes back to school and passes each grade from first to 12th he will hand the company over to him.I have to admit that I have always loved this movie, don't know what it is about these crazy early Sandler flicks but I love them. I mean come on, Sandler, Steve Buscemi, Chris Farley, Norm Macdonald and more. It is that stupid humor but it is also fun humor, Sandler interacting with the kids and everything is priceless. There are some classic moments in this film like the peeing in ones pants and the interactions between Billy and the man looking to take his father's company. You classic stupid/dumb humor like that, I can't help it but I love it.Director Tamra Davis [who directed other classic comedies such as ""Half Baked"", ""Best Men"", and ""CB4""] does a good job keeping Sandler and Tim Herlihy's script moving at a good pace and the film never gets boring. As far as acting it is just what you would want from this type of flick. Sandler is his usual crazy self and Norm MacDonald is his perfect self as well. Bridgette Wilson is as hot as ever, I still wish Billy would have gotten more questions right in that tent. Bradley Whitford is a show stealer throughout the entire flick and is a great villain. Every one here is perfect for their part including the uncredited Steve Buscemi, love it.I know a lot of people do not like this movie but I know a lot love it, I am one of those who love it. It is the perfect movie for a nice and relaxing lazy day, I need me one of those so I may watch this once again here soon. The DVD is great with a commentary from the director and is a good one.

Billy then says: ""I'd get off the couch and go find my fu***** dog!"" in front of many 3rd graders.3. Billy completely ""kills"" little 3rd or 4th graders in a game of dodgeball.There you go.

This is when Billy's father promises him inheritance to his hotel chain if he can sit through grades 1-12 for 2 weeks each.

There is another man, Eric, clearly more mature and experienced than him, who Billy portrays as a villain trying to take control of his dad's company instead. But of course, Billy wins in the end.There may be a line or two in the script that is interesting, but aside from that, it's terrible. How can a man who never studied seriously in his life spend only two weeks each to pass a year's worth of information in every grade in school?

It's nice to see Adam Sandler on screen not just playing Adam Sandler.  Here he plays Billy Madison, the lazy son of a hotel tycoon who finds out that, due to his complete lack of ambition and nearly equal lack of intelligence, his father intends to pass the family hotel chain on to an associate of his named Eric whom Billy Despises.  Not wanting to let this happen, Billy decides to go back to school, as his first go-around turned out to have been bought and paid for by his father, completing each of the twelve grades in two weeks' time.  It's nice when you're rich enough to make the public school system bend over for an insane project like this...education reformers should really watch this film.  While Billy works his way through school, Eric, played creepily by Bradley Whitford, schemes to interfere with his success as failure would ensure that the latter man gets the hotel company.  Meanwhile, Billy meets and falls for his two-week 3rd grade teacher Veronica, played by Bridgette Wilson.  Now, some might think that this plot line would never work, regardless of who was starring in the film.  I was among those doubters.  But thankfully, I was proven wrong.  As weird as the idea of Adam Sandler sitting and learning among elementary school students, the filmmakers and Mr. Sandler actually make it work.  While the other characters may acknowledge the strangeness of the situation, they never overdo that joke.  If anything, only the housekeeper was a bit strange, but even she never overdid it too badly.  And Adam Sandler's singing was pretty good.  If you want to label any Adam Sandler movie as your favorite, this one would definitely be a good candidate...it was for me.

Billy Madison is a perfectly silly movie that requires no thought and need not be overanalyzed. It's an Adam Sandler movie for crying outloud, not a ground-breaking documentary, so get over it. If you enjoy Adam Sandler and have somehow missed Billy Madison, you need to go get it right now. Billy Madison (Adam Sandler) has coasted through life on his father's dime. His father is preparing to retire and wants to leave his hotel empire to his only son, but Billy just wants to drink in the sun all day and live the good life (can't say I blame him). However, due to Billy's lack of responsibility and drunken penguin-chasing ways, his father can't in good conscious turn the company over to Billy. Plus, his dad admits he paid off all of Billy's teachers from the first grade on to let him pass. His dad wants to turn the company over to a man named Eric who has worked for him for years, but Eric's an evil guy. Billy doesn't want Eric to gain control of his father's hotels so he throws a log on the fire - he comes up with an idea to return to school and take each grade over again in order to take over the company. And of course, this is where the movie takes on new silliness. I'm not saying this is an Oscar-winner or anything like that, but if you've had a bad day at the office or just need something mindless and amusing to zone out to, Billy Madison is the movie for you.

However, the film's driving theme is that underlying fear that all adults have nightmares about; that is the very thought of having to relive your school years over again. This is what Billy Madison has to go through to prove to his father, a Hotel Chain Chairman Brian Madison (Darren McGavin--A CHRISTMAS STORY), that he is not the idiot he is perceived to be and he is capable enough to take over the hotel chairmanship when his father retires. The audience is given the privy information that his father had to pay all of Billy's teachers in order for him to pass high school.  In one hilarious moment, before his father gives the blessing for Billy go back to school, the elder Madison recalls a spelling bee in which Billy spells the word 'rock' ""r-o-k"". At which Billy exclaims ""Yeah, so what's your point?!"" At the same time, one of Brian Madison's sidemen Eric (Bradley Whitford--tv's THE WEST WING) is scheming to take over that chairmanship by trying to sabotage Billy's foray back into the school system.  Adam Sandler had made a couple of films prior to this, but this film and HAPPY GILMORE established his screen persona and enhancing his SNL popularity. Sandler is hilarious (in the eyes of Sandler fans only?) with his child-man persona that only he can pull off.  Also, there are some hilarious cameos that help the plot along  (i.e. Steve Buscemi, Chris Farley, and Norm McDonald). As with a lot of Sandler's films, there is always that underlying theme of the main character's devotion to family members no matter the conflict (i.e. HAPPY GILMORE, the grandmother; THE WATERBOY, the mother) and in this film, its the father. The children characters he meets as he is going through the grades are not too annoying or smart-alecky (Adam Sandler fills that void to a degree) and a few of them are engaging. Another funny aspect of the film is, as Billy passes each grade (from kindergarten to high school), he is thrown a big outdoor party at his father's mansion. Overall, a typical Adam Sandler effort that has alot of funny moments, funny characters, a thought-provoking plot of having to go back to school, and a very attractive co-star, Bridgette Wilson (Mrs. Pete Sampras) as Veronica, one of Billy Madison's teachers.",4,Adam Sandler...

45665,AP3B615GM191G,0783214243,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","As we grow old with every passing year, most of us look back on those carefree days of childhood and wish that freedom was ours to enjoy once again.  Well, Billy Madison (Adam Sandler) gets to do exactly that!Basically, the premise of the film is that Billy, a young-20s loser who stands to inherit his father's wealthy company, must return to school for two weeks in every grade in order to prove to dear old Dad that he is worthy of that inheritance, lest it be handed to ""evil"" businessman Eric.Now, first and foremost, this is very much an ""Adam Sandler film"", much along the lines of Happy Gilmore.  If you don't like his persona or type of humor, than stay away from this film altogether.  However, if you find his shenanigans to be quite amusing, than I consider this to be the peak of his comedic-acting roles.The reason this film ends up being so charming is that it taps into that little kid in all of us, the one who looks back at those grade- and high-school days with equal parts nostalgia and horror.  The movie does an excellent job of portraying both and oh so much more, including the standard ""crush on teacher"" (which takes on a new twist considering the student is 20 years old!), ""bullying"", and ""social cliques/interaction"" vignettes.  There is nary a person in the entire USA who can't, at least on some level, relate to the type of jokes that Sandler and Co. provide in this film.About the only reason I don't consider ""Billy Madison"" to be a truly classic film is the insertion of the stoner themes and Sandler's sometimes crude, adolescent humor (although in this film it is toned down a bit from some others).  Had the focus truly been on a family audience, instead of the 20-something age group that Sandler usually targets, it could have been one of the most unique films ever produced.  Instead, at times, it gets bogged down in Sandler's idiot rants and overly-crude jokes.All in all, though, ""Billy Madison"" is a funny movie that will keep you laughing from beginning to end.  Though not for the young kiddies (crudity/profanity) or very likely older parents (who just don't ""get"" Sandler's appeal), this is a great movie to watch with your buddies or same-age relatives.
