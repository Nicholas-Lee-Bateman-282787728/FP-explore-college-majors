1521390,A1N1H9FB2LKVI3,B006WNSHUY,DarthJustice,"[2, 2]","Where On Earth Is Carmen Sandiego is a cartoon that ran on Saturday mornings from 1994 to 1999. Based on the popular Carmen Sandiego games, each episode has the titular thief committing grandiose crimes as Acme detectives and siblings Ivy and Zach track her down and try capturing the former Acme detective. All the while they occasionally receive help from other detectives and support from Acme chief, appropriately named Chief (who is voiced by the same voice actor that voices Spongebob's Squidward and also looks like a certain Real Ghostbuster...)As someone who grew up watching the cartoon, it was great to finally get the chance to own it on DVD. The packaging itself I'm not entirely crazy about, as another reviewer also mentioned. The case itself looks great and then when you open it, the actual DVDs are stacked upon each other in cheap paper sleeves. For less than $5, not counting shipping, I suppose you can't expect a whole a lot, but it still would have been nice to have them packaged slightly better. I remember the show Archie's Weird Mysteries, also put out by the same company (which I reviewed last year), was given the same treatment. It's not a big gripe, but nonetheless...The show itself is still very enjoyable. Not only still entertaining in its own right, but it also has its educational value as well, which is great for young kids. As I said about David the Gnome, the the ability to balance the entertainment and educational aspects seems to have been lost on people responsible for these shows. You have shows like this and David the Gnome and then you look at some shows of a similar nature and it's very noticeable. Such shows now have become ""let's shove it down kids and treat them like idiots' throats!"" But I digress.I think the show has aged very well.Bottom line is if you were a fan, the show is still worth a buy, especially with its current pricing.",5,Edutainment Done Right,1366848000,"04 25, 2013",2013,1895,"['Where', 'Earth', 'Is', 'Carmen', 'Sandiego', 'cartoon', 'ran', 'Saturday', 'mornings', '1994', '1999', 'Based', 'popular', 'Carmen', 'Sandiego', 'games', 'episode', 'titular', 'thief', 'committing', 'grandiose', 'crimes', 'Acme', 'detectives', 'siblings', 'Ivy', 'Zach', 'track', 'down', 'try', 'capturing', 'former', 'Acme', 'detective', 'occasionally', 'receive', 'help', 'other', 'detectives', 'support', 'Acme', 'chief', 'appropriately', 'named', 'Chief', 'who', 'voiced', 'same', 'voice', 'actor', 'Spongebob', 'Squidward', 'also', 'certain', 'Real', 'Ghostbuster', 'someone', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'cartoon', 'was', 'great', 'finally', 'get', 'chance', 'own', 'DVD', 'packaging', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'crazy', 'about', 'reviewer', 'also', 'mentioned', 'case', 'great', 'then', 'when', 'open', 'actual', 'DVDs', 'are', 'stacked', 'other', 'cheap', 'paper', 'sleeves', 'less', '5', 'not', 'counting', 'shipping', 'suppose', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'whole', 'lot', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'packaged', 'slightly', 'better', 'remember', 'show', 'Archie', 'Weird', 'Mysteries', 'also', 'put', 'out', 'same', 'company', 'reviewed', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'given', 'same', 'treatment', 'not', 'big', 'gripe', 'nonetheless', 'show', 'still', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'Not', 'only', 'still', 'entertaining', 'own', 'right', 'also', 'educational', 'value', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'young', 'kids', 'said', 'David', 'Gnome', 'ability', 'balance', 'entertainment', 'educational', 'aspects', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'people', 'responsible', 'shows', 'have', 'shows', 'David', 'Gnome', 'then', 'look', 'shows', 'similar', 'nature', 'very', 'noticeable', 'Such', 'shows', 'now', 'have', 'become', 'let', 'shove', 'down', 'kids', 'treat', 'idiots', 'throats', 'digress.I', 'think', 'show', 'aged', 'very', 'well.Bottom', 'line', 'were', 'fan', 'show', 'still', 'worth', 'buy', 'especially', 'current', 'pricing']",Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego? - The Complete Series

I liked the show then and understood a chunk of it but not all.Now in my 20s I fully understand it and the information it provides. I must say I like Zack and Ivy, the  gumshoes that get the stolen items back but never are quite quick enough to catch carmen. Even though eventually they do catch her for a short time.The show  provides an endless amount of facts about people and places. I  always feel like I am learning something and not just simply being entertained. Though it does a good job at doing that too!The chief keeps things even more interesting with his over the wall personality.I have to say my favorite character is Carmen herself, even though she is the bad guy. She makes  stealing seem cool due to her always calm demeanor and last minute escapes. She always seems to have at least one more trick up her sleeve.It is fun to watch her out maneuver the everyone again and again. She steals for the challenge of it and  this makes her stick out more than your common thief.The show feels like it should have been on  pbs but has enough action and animation to support it being on fox at the time. This is a wonderful show point blank.The suspense and action are real so you feel like the show is actually taking place in real life.I haven't seen all the episodes on the dvd, but I am glad to own the whole series.

1521415,A13L7XH3VFBLNV,B006WNSHUY,MoonLiteStar88,"[80, 86]","I just got my copy in the mail today after a short delay of the release. I watched this series as child when it was still airing on FOX in the mid 90's and the show is still just as good as I remembered it. The show is very kid friendly and has a bit of an educational theme. Now let's get to the specs of this DVD.Approx Runtime: 14hrs and 20 minAspect Ratio: 4:3/1:33:1All 40 episodes on 4 DVD'sThe image quality is a bit of a disappointment since they crammed 10 episodes per DVD as well as some bonus features. That said, when I play this on my computer, my DVD fan will run very high because so much space was used on the DVD's. In my opinion, it would've been a lot better if they released this on Blu-Ray. As we all know, Blu-Ray DVD's can hold a lot more space than regular DVD's. Personally, I gladly would have forked over $50 for the complete set (as long as it's in airdate order and uncut) on Blu-Ray either that or they should have put them on more DVD's but I suppose this release will do for now.The packaging is pretty piss poor. The DVD's come in 4 paper sleeves and a single DVD case. Whoever thought that was a great idea to hold DVD's that way should be fired. This puts the DVD's at risk for scratching and plenty of finger prints.

1521426,A1G2Y89G496IF0,B006WNSHUY,Terry,"[1, 1]","Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego is an educational cartoon in which the most famous world crook (Sandiego) pulls of the most daring heists (such as stealing the eyes off of the portrait of Van Gogh or stealing Cathrine the Great's statue from Russia) where she takes famous landmarks, ruins, paintings, etc. All of it in a spirit of playing an intellectually challenging game against two teenaged detectives Zac and Ivy (a brother and sister duo detective act from ACME).This cartoon takes the viewer (young and older) on trips around the world with Ivy and Zac to track down Carmen. Usually the episodes begin with Carmen completing a theft and then leaving clues for the detectives to pick up on. As the two try to figure them out, Carmen endeavors to set a theme to her crime of the day and complete it for a playful twist of some kind. We as the viewers learn history, geography, and other cultures as the clues unfurl and lead us ever closer to that Carmen Sandiego.The voices, art, and humor all come together to create excitement and laughter and make it all look good. Where as there are serious points that highlight key moral issues for the viewers to contemplate to add counter balance. Such as cases where the siblings must work to save Sandiego or work with her to complete an end and fight against something much worse than a famous thief. And the creators decided to give Carmen a strict sense of morality in which she doesn't hurt people, doesn't really want to have them hurt.Overall, this is educational and fun. And while I can't say this is a substitute for reading, studying, and genuinely taking an interest in these things, it at least will pave the way for curiosity and what not. Heck, did for me.
