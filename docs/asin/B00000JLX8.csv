It does not seem that scary, but you will keep getting frightened more and more even though you wont know  why. I think it is because for once, you do not want the people in the  movie to die.  Usually you could take or leave the characters, but you see  that none of these people really deserve to die.  Its like the death of  Randy in Scream 2, just every character is like that.  Also there is not a  lot of gore at all, they give you just enough to make girls scream and grip  to you (literally, if the girl is afraid of clowns) but it doenst gross you  out, or over do it on the blood.

Just some thoughts on this movie...The Clown At Midnight (1999) is a Canadian teen slasher movie that takes place mainly inside an old opera house where a killer clown stalks his victims.  That's the unique part of this movie - the opera house setting.  The killer clown concept?  We've all seen it before, but some movies of this type are better than this one (such as ""It"" and ""Clownhouse"").  The killer clown reminds me of Michael Myers, only he's a clown who talks.  The death scenes are well done.  The special effects are good, as is the makeup.  The kids in this movie seem to fight back pretty well, unlike in a lot of slasher movies where kids seem to lack any ability to fight back.Look for Margot Kidder in a supporting role.  We all know her from such movies as Black Christmas (1974), The Amityville Horror (1979), and the Superman movies.  The acting in this movie is average.  The musical score is decent.I recommend this flick to all fans of slasher movies to see at least once.",3,Predictable but unique teen slasher,1339459200,"06 12, 2012",2012,1052,"['description', 'plot', 'etc.', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'Just', 'thoughts', 'movie', 'Clown', 'Midnight', '1999', 'Canadian', 'teen', 'slasher', 'movie', 'place', 'mainly', 'old', 'opera', 'house', 'where', 'killer', 'clown', 'stalks', 'victims', 'unique', 'part', 'movie', 'opera', 'house', 'setting', 'killer', 'clown', 'concept', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', 'type', 'are', 'better', 'one', 'such', 'Clownhouse', 'killer', 'clown', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'only', 'clown', 'who', 'death', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'makeup', 'kids', 'movie', 'seem', 'fight', 'back', 'pretty', 'well', 'lot', 'slasher', 'movies', 'where', 'kids', 'seem', 'lack', 'ability', 'fight', 'back.Look', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'supporting', 'role', 'know', 'such', 'movies', 'Black', 'Christmas', '1974', 'Amityville', 'Horror', '1979', 'Superman', 'movies', 'acting', 'movie', 'average', 'musical', 'score', 'decent.I', 'recommend', 'flick', 'fans', 'slasher', 'movies', 'see', 'least', 'once']",Clown at Midnight VHS

But ""IT"" (first half) and ""Killer Klowns from Outer Space"" this ain't. Heck, this ain't even ""Clownhouse"".This is a Canadian production attempting to cash in on the Scream/I Know What You Did brand of teenage slashers, but it falls dreadfully flatThe characters are obnoxious and truly awful, and the acting is terrible. The story fails to take advantage of its potentially promising opera house setting, and the killer, a man in ""Pagliacci"" makeup, is a bore. The film can't seem to generate the creepiness it aspires to, and lacks what it takes to make a psychotic clown story work: sardonic wit.There is no wit here, sardonic or otherwise.And, by the way, what's with Margot Kidder and Christopher Plummer getting top billing on the video box, when they don't even appear on the cover with the rest of the cast?Come to think of it, what is the great Christopher Plummer doing here at all?This is exactly the sort of movie you would expect to find a faded, single-claim-to-fame star like Margot Kidder in, but Plummer?

506437,ASCR6RUWOU1F9,B00000JLX8,Kane's Review,"[0, 0]","Being the evil clown fanatic that I am, I had to check out this movie. At first I wasn't too fond of it when I saw the trailer but me being the clown lover I am couldn't resist and I had to give it a watch. I'm glad I did as it turned out to be a good movieThe Clown At Midnight is about a group of 7 high school teens who have been chosen to help refurbish a decrepit opera house. Many years prior, opera singer, Lorraine Sedgewick was murdered in her dressing room by opera Pagliacci, Lorenzo.Orsini. When Orsini was thought to have fled to Europe afterwards, the opera house closed down. Now, high school students Kate, Monica, Cheryl, George, Marty, Ashley, and her boyfriend Taylor have all been chosen to reconstruct the opera house with the aid of nuisance teacher, Ms. Gibby.Not too long after, Kate, who happens to be the deceased Lorraine's daughter, is plagued with horrible visions of her mother's murder. The more time Kate spends in the opera house, her visions begin to clearly piece together her mother's death, when she ends up discovering she's linked to the alleged clown killer. As Kate tries to solve the eerie mystery of Lorraine's death, her peers are being gruesomely killed off one by one until she's the only one left. Will Kate find the answers she's looking for or will she too suffer the same fate her mother and friends are facing?Overall: This is a really good clown movie, despite what others may say. The clown in this movie is just downright creepy! The faces he makes when he stalks his victims are beyond creeper status. The clown is no Pennywise, but he's horrifying in his own way. The plot of the film is decently solid and takes a somewhat predictable twist nearing the end. This is a teen slasher with a lot of typical teen characters. You have your hot but stuck-up and pretentious blonde. The nerd, the gay, the borderline douchebag football player, and the interesting loner. However, because this movie was made in the 1998 and many 80s and 90s horror movies had stereotypical characters, it's forgivable.

I watched it, and it really freaked me in a way. It's not pulse-pounding horror, but it seems almost real. The acting can get a bit HORRIBLE at times, but most of it is good, and it helps out. I know there isn't much gore in this film, unlike most new horror films, but UNLIKE new teen horrors, this has nudity. That guarantees this film to be Canadian, because in the U.S. That shouldn't be the reason why you see this film, but sadly, most male viewers will want this only for that. But in terms of fear, this film does rank right up there with ""Scream."" The clown, who you actually get to see often, is scary, and makes you shake. You care about most of the characters, and so you're sad when the get killed off. Also, seeing both Margot Kidder, who deserves a bit of a ""scream-queen"" title, and Christopher Plummer, who you're kinda suprised to see, really makes the film better, because with them, it doesn't seem as much as a teen horror as most films.The only couple of bad things about this film is the stereotypical characters, who you care for, but aren't really unique and are there mainly for the purpose of being killed. Also, like I mentioned before, the sometimes horrendous acting by a couple of characters can get annoying FAST. And finally, the death of a certain character makes me mad, seeing how they were great to watch and didn't deserve it.But other than those couple things, this is a good film that undoubtedly got less than it deserved.
