Were any other actress in the biggest blockbuster ever --`Titanic'--, she would follow up with another big movie, and become a sort of heroine. But Winslet, no! She doesn't want that. And here she is, in a small movie, with a low budget and with such a peculiar title. She doesn't care, as long as she's doing what she likes-- and by the way, she does it very well.`Hideous Kinky' tells the story of a British young woman who with her two little daughters leave the boring  and grey London and her poet husband to go to a sunny and exotic place in Morocco in the early 70s. Her idea is to find a Sufi guru  who will instructs her in the annihilation of Ego. While seeking this man, she falls in love, lives in awful conditions and even has to be apart from one of her daugthers.Needless to say that Winslet brings all the passion and power that this character needs. Her presence is magic and almost perfect. She is playing the kind of outsider anyone is expecting Winslet to play. It is impossible to imagine any other girl doing this role. Her two daughters are very good too, showing how lost they are in that place that is far from what they've been their whole lives.The script is based on Esther Freud's novel, and it interesting to think that the source material was written by a descendent of Freud --the man who made the word Ego the mantra of XX century. Another thing that shines in the movie is the soundtrack. Full of songs from the late 60s, it gives the right tone to the story. Not failing to mention the Moroccan song that are terrific!

17145,A141HP4LYPWMSR,0767823931,Brian E. Erland,"[3, 3]","Synopsis: Set in the year 1972 in Marrakech, Morocco we find twenty-five year old British hippie Julia (Kate Winslet) wandering about Marrakech with her two young daughters.  Tired of the sameness of everyday life she has left the father of her children behind in London in search of ""something different"" for the children and herself in North Africa.Julia and the girls wander about the exotic landscape interacting with the locals, other occidental fellow seekers and an occasional British ex-patriot or two. She becomes involved in a romantic interlude with a street performer named Bilal (Said Taqhmaoui) but her real quest is not to find another man, but to discover the Truth (yes, with a capital T). She hopes what she is looking for will be revealed to her by the resident leader of a group of Sufi's, a sect of Islamic mystics flourishing in the area. The only question is whether or not she's ready for the answer?Critique: `Hideous Kinky' released in '99 is an exquisite film that insightfully captures the innate human desire to find some form of spiritual underpinning in life to counterbalance a mundane world consisting of nothing more than duties and passing pleasures. The film takes the viewer on a slow, meandering, hypnotic journey through the cities and countryside of Morocco. The goal of the storyline is at times unclear, but then so is any true spiritual journey. And like any real quest for truth the answers one receives are generally not answers at all, only more questions. It's this ambiguity of thought and motion that is the real beauty and message of this mesmerizing film. The amazing scenery coupled with a soundtrack consisting of late `60's, early `70's pop tunes interspersed between African rhythms and Sufi trance music make for a magical mystery tour to another world.Recommendation: This film belongs in your permanent DVD collection.",5,"""The Truth Is A Man Standing Upright In The Sun"" ~ Duties And Passing Pleasures On The Road To Annihilation",1172448000,"02 26, 2007",2007,1876,"['Synopsis', 'Set', 'year', '1972', 'Marrakech', 'Morocco', 'find', 'twenty-five', 'year', 'old', 'British', 'hippie', 'Julia', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'wandering', 'Marrakech', 'two', 'young', 'daughters', 'Tired', 'sameness', 'everyday', 'life', 'left', 'father', 'children', 'London', 'search', 'something', 'different', 'children', 'North', 'Africa.Julia', 'girls', 'wander', 'exotic', 'landscape', 'interacting', 'locals', 'other', 'occidental', 'fellow', 'seekers', 'occasional', 'British', 'ex-patriot', 'two', 'involved', 'romantic', 'interlude', 'street', 'performer', 'named', 'Bilal', 'Said', 'Taqhmaoui', 'real', 'quest', 'not', 'find', 'man', 'discover', 'Truth', 'yes', 'capital', 'T', 'what', 'looking', 'will', 'be', 'revealed', 'resident', 'leader', 'group', 'Sufi', 'sect', 'Islamic', 'mystics', 'flourishing', 'area', 'only', 'question', 'not', 'ready', 'answer', 'Critique', 'Hideous', 'Kinky', 'released', ""'99"", 'exquisite', 'film', 'insightfully', 'innate', 'human', 'desire', 'find', 'form', 'spiritual', 'underpinning', 'life', 'counterbalance', 'mundane', 'world', 'consisting', 'nothing', 'more', 'duties', 'passing', 'pleasures', 'film', 'viewer', 'slow', 'meandering', 'hypnotic', 'journey', 'cities', 'countryside', 'Morocco', 'goal', 'storyline', 'times', 'unclear', 'then', 'so', 'true', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'real', 'quest', 'truth', 'answers', 'one', 'receives', 'are', 'generally', 'not', 'answers', 'only', 'more', 'questions', 'ambiguity', 'thought', 'motion', 'real', 'beauty', 'message', 'mesmerizing', 'film', 'amazing', 'scenery', 'coupled', 'soundtrack', 'consisting', 'late', '60', 'early', '70', 'pop', 'tunes', 'interspersed', 'African', 'rhythms', 'Sufi', 'trance', 'music', 'make', 'magical', 'mystery', 'tour', 'world.Recommendation', 'film', 'permanent', 'DVD', 'collection']",N/A

Almost from the first moment, though, I was involved, which says a lot.  It is the parts that pull; summarizing the whole doesn't particularly advertise this in one way or another.  For me, it is a respectful but clear-eyed reconsideration of the nomadic hippie generation in search of spiritual enlightenment and the effect on its own children.  Kate Winslet is wonderful but the child actresses playing her young daughters are absolutely sublime.  The film's success lies in part in giving plenty of time to their reactions and part of the story.  The direction, pace and camera angles provide the tension that is lacking in the actual action.  As for the location shooting and depiction of Moroccan culture, it matches perfectly the memories I've saved from being an adolescent a continent and ocean apart from my parents in that part of the world, in the same era.  That's the ultimate success of the film for me:  it portrays it as it was, the highs and the lows, but it also joins me in the reflection born of time and growth. It is sweet, not too bitter. You don't have to be of my generation to appreciate it; just about anyone can identify with being very young and embarrassed and confused by one's parent as Lucy and Bea are by Julia (Winslet).",4,It quickly grows on you,976579200,"12 12, 2000",2000,1373,"['did', ""n't"", 'even', 'intend', 'watch', 'someone', 'else', 'had', 'channel', 'tuned', 'volume', 'was', 'low', 'had', 'book', 'hand', 'Almost', 'first', 'moment', 'was', 'involved', 'lot', 'parts', 'pull', 'summarizing', 'whole', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'advertise', 'one', 'way', 'respectful', 'clear-eyed', 'reconsideration', 'nomadic', 'hippie', 'generation', 'search', 'spiritual', 'enlightenment', 'effect', 'own', 'children', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'wonderful', 'child', 'playing', 'young', 'daughters', 'are', 'absolutely', 'sublime', 'film', 'success', 'part', 'giving', 'plenty', 'time', 'reactions', 'part', 'story', 'direction', 'pace', 'camera', 'angles', 'provide', 'tension', 'lacking', 'actual', 'action', 'location', 'shooting', 'depiction', 'Moroccan', 'culture', 'perfectly', 'memories', ""'ve"", 'saved', 'being', 'adolescent', 'continent', 'ocean', 'apart', 'parents', 'part', 'world', 'same', 'era', 'ultimate', 'success', 'film', 'was', 'highs', 'lows', 'also', 'reflection', 'time', 'growth', 'sweet', 'not', 'too', 'bitter', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'generation', 'appreciate', 'just', 'anyone', 'can', 'identify', 'being', 'very', 'young', 'embarrassed', 'confused', 'one', 'parent', 'Lucy', 'Bea', 'are', 'Julia', 'Winslet']",N/A
17148,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0767823931,Dennis Littrell,"[11, 12]","Kate Winslet (Julia) eschews the glamour here in favor of depicting a 25-year-old mother of two seeking adventure and enlightenment with the Sufis in Morocco (instead of with the yogis in India, as was once the fashion).  The year is 1972 and Julia might be a welfare mother except that there's no dole and the locale is rather exotic.  Having left her poet husband behind in London, rather than ""share him,"" Julia seeks the annihilation of the ego, and the god within.  What she finds (aside from the fact that she's a little too young for that) is Bilal (Said Taghmaoui), a Marrakech street performer of questionable character who speaks English and charms her and her daughters.Beautiful cinematography combined with a steady effort by Kate and winning performances from Bella Riza (Bea) and Carrie Mullan (Lucy) as her pre-adolescent daughters, however, cannot quite save this slightly plotted, although always realistic tale, from the bargain video bin.Too bad because there is something wonderfully charming and honest about this film.  ""Wow!  Hideous!  Kinky!"" is what the girls like to exclaim (in their London accents) in reaction to their experiences in the world.  When Bea, wise as only a nine-year-old can be, describes the women on the balcony as ""prostitutes,"" so thick is her accent that only the context allowed this old Yankee's ears to comprehend.  There is a little peek-a-boo nudity that might offend some, and yes Marrakech and environs look as clean and sparkling as an upscale suburban mall, and true the editing is jumpy and a little chaotic; but in the land of the whirling dervishes perhaps this is as it should be.  Bea is the daughter who disapproves of mum's adventurous spirit and wants to be ""normal"" and go to school every day (reminding me of Cher and Winona Ryder in Mermaids (1990)), while younger daughter Lucy finds love in her heart for all, especially for mum's new boy friend, Bilal.  Somehow she actually teaches him the beginnings of responsibility, while he shares with them the delight of being alive.I think what carries this story (from the novel by Esther Freud-yes, a relation) and made it an attractive part for Kate Winslet is the fair and honest character of Julia who struggles to find herself while caring for two little girls, which is what it is like for all women.  A woman cannot find herself alone.  She cannot throw off the constraints and responsibility of being a mother, because those are HER children.  So she must take them along where ever she goes and find with them whatever it is she seeks, and this is a burden and a delight, as this film, despite its shortcomings, clearly shows.--Dennis Littrell, author of ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""",3,"Warm, charming and honest but lacks tension",975628800,"12 1, 2000",2000,2748,"['Kate', 'Winslet', 'Julia', 'glamour', 'here', 'favor', 'depicting', '25-year-old', 'mother', 'two', 'seeking', 'adventure', 'enlightenment', 'Sufis', 'Morocco', 'instead', 'yogis', 'India', 'was', 'once', 'fashion', 'year', '1972', 'Julia', 'might', 'be', 'welfare', 'mother', 'dole', 'locale', 'rather', 'exotic', 'Having', 'left', 'poet', 'husband', 'London', 'rather', 'share', 'Julia', 'annihilation', 'ego', 'god', 'What', 'aside', 'fact', 'little', 'too', 'young', 'Bilal', 'Said', 'Taghmaoui', 'Marrakech', 'street', 'performer', 'questionable', 'character', 'who', 'English', 'daughters.Beautiful', 'cinematography', 'combined', 'steady', 'effort', 'Kate', 'winning', 'performances', 'Bella', 'Riza', 'Bea', 'Carrie', 'Mullan', 'Lucy', 'pre-adolescent', 'daughters', 'however', 'can', 'not', 'quite', 'save', 'slightly', 'plotted', 'always', 'realistic', 'tale', 'bargain', 'video', 'bin.Too', 'bad', 'something', 'wonderfully', 'charming', 'honest', 'film', 'Wow', 'Hideous', 'Kinky', 'what', 'girls', 'exclaim', 'London', 'accents', 'reaction', 'experiences', 'world', 'When', 'Bea', 'wise', 'only', 'nine-year-old', 'can', 'be', 'describes', 'women', 'balcony', 'prostitutes', 'thick', 'accent', 'only', 'context', 'allowed', 'old', 'Yankee', 'ears', 'comprehend', 'little', 'peek-a-boo', 'nudity', 'might', 'offend', 'yes', 'Marrakech', 'environs', 'look', 'clean', 'sparkling', 'upscale', 'suburban', 'mall', 'true', 'editing', 'jumpy', 'little', 'chaotic', 'land', 'whirling', 'perhaps', 'should', 'be', 'Bea', 'daughter', 'who', 'mum', 'adventurous', 'spirit', 'be', 'normal', 'go', 'school', 'day', 'reminding', 'Cher', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'Mermaids', '1990', 'younger', 'daughter', 'Lucy', 'love', 'heart', 'especially', 'mum', 'new', 'boy', 'friend', 'Bilal', 'Somehow', 'actually', 'beginnings', 'responsibility', 'shares', 'delight', 'being', 'alive.I', 'think', 'what', 'story', 'novel', 'Esther', 'Freud-yes', 'relation', 'made', 'attractive', 'part', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'fair', 'honest', 'character', 'Julia', 'who', 'find', 'caring', 'two', 'little', 'girls', 'what', 'women', 'woman', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'alone', 'can', 'not', 'throw', 'off', 'constraints', 'responsibility', 'being', 'mother', 'are', 'HER', 'children', 'must', 'take', 'along', 'where', 'ever', 'find', 'burden', 'delight', 'film', 'shortcomings', 'clearly', 'shows.', 'Dennis', 'Littrell', 'author', 'Cut', 'Chaise', 'Lounge', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Believe', 'Swallowed', 'Remote']",N/A

17152,A1KLG8F5APLM2N,0767823931,h,"[10, 13]","""Hideous Kinky"" are the first and last words spoken in this film.  No, the movie is not about sex, it's based on Esther Freud's autobiographical novel (yes, that Freud) about nomadic life in Northern Africa in 1972.  The title, ""Hideous Kinky"" is the name of a game the young girls play, much like tag.  The very beautiful Kate Winslet plays Julia, mother of two, who drags her two children, Bea and Lucy from London, England in search of a more free and spiritual life. The story is narrated time to time by Bea, the eldest daughter.Julia is married to an English poet and writer, better known to them as the ultimate dead-beat Dad. From small clues, we gather that he is adultrous, a bit of a wash-up, and only offers support to the small family with checks, that rarely arrive when needed.Julia lives meagerly, selling dolls to support herself, but this occupation seems as pitiful as standing on a street corner asking for charity. Her existense is ironic. She and her girls live in a tiny, broken down, prostitute hang-out apartment with little clothing, money, or clean water. They live day by day in search of money or the next charitable helper. While her life seems desperate and chaotic, she is surrounded by some of the most beautiful and colorful culture in the world.  Perhaps this is why Julia can not give up her nomadic lifestyle.  The cities of Morocco are too enchanting to leave.  I found myself constantly asking ""Is it worth it? What are they gaining?""She admits to others she has chosen this life. She doesn't want the normalcy of a one room London flat and TV ringing through her children's ears night and day. Instead, in Morocco, she hopes to find keys to a happier afterlife, one with no pain or suffering...but WHO is she living this life for? Her family, or herself?  On her quest she encounters romance, spiritual obstacles, and loss.  Julia is challenged to choose between her beloved new country or face the ""real world"" back home. This is not a movie about a young woman's struggle, rather the relationships she has with her lover, children and others that open new and different doors and opportunities.The movie is so visually stunning, you can't help but look at the Marrakech markets and think you might be smelling spices and tasting exotic things.

17153,A2OP1HD9RGX5OW,0767823931,"Jedidiah Palosaari ""Not My Real Name""","[3, 6]","Wonderful film, of Julia taking her kids from England, pulling them around Morocco in the early seventies, as she searches for wisdom and enlightenment in the Islamic mysticism of Sufism.  The characters are well done, and the children *very* well acted, sweet and engaging.  Here one gets a strong foretaste of travels to Morocco, with beautiful scenes of Marrakech and the desert.Some drawbacks:  brief nudity, Christians are portrayed too negatively, and one child is not entirely believable in her dislike of the free life in Morocco.  Children have more imagination than that, and every child I have ever known enjoys adventure and travel at that age.Some of the characters, and indeed some viewers, feel Julia displays poor parenting skills, for she pursues her spiritual enlightenment at the expense of raising her children.  The one child mentioned above in the movie struggles greatly with the desire to lead a ""normal"" life.  From my perspective, growing up in a Jesus Freak commune (a people who are even mentioned in this movie), Julia's actions are not only entirely appropriate, but beneficial to her children, allowing them to experience greater spiritual depth.  Growing up, we continuously traveled around, in many countries, and I am grateful to my parents for such an experience.  I recommend this movie not as a view into a woman who is not raising her kids right, because she is being too selfish; but rather a look at how one can provide far greater opportunity to one's children through bold adventure, and how many children miss out because parents do not provide that opportunity.Hideous Kinky: A Novel",4,Reminded me of my Childhood,1055376000,"06 12, 2003",2003,1627,"['Wonderful', 'film', 'Julia', 'taking', 'kids', 'England', 'pulling', 'around', 'Morocco', 'early', 'seventies', 'wisdom', 'enlightenment', 'Islamic', 'mysticism', 'Sufism', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'children', '*very*', 'well', 'acted', 'sweet', 'engaging', 'Here', 'one', 'strong', 'foretaste', 'travels', 'Morocco', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'Marrakech', 'desert.Some', 'drawbacks', 'brief', 'nudity', 'Christians', 'are', 'portrayed', 'too', 'negatively', 'one', 'child', 'not', 'entirely', 'believable', 'dislike', 'free', 'life', 'Morocco', 'Children', 'have', 'more', 'imagination', 'child', 'have', 'ever', 'known', 'enjoys', 'adventure', 'travel', 'age.Some', 'characters', 'indeed', 'viewers', 'feel', 'Julia', 'displays', 'poor', 'parenting', 'skills', 'spiritual', 'enlightenment', 'expense', 'raising', 'children', 'one', 'child', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'greatly', 'desire', 'lead', 'normal', 'life', 'perspective', 'growing', 'up', 'Jesus', 'Freak', 'commune', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'even', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'Julia', 'actions', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'entirely', 'appropriate', 'beneficial', 'children', 'allowing', 'experience', 'greater', 'spiritual', 'depth', 'Growing', 'up', 'continuously', 'traveled', 'around', 'many', 'countries', 'am', 'grateful', 'parents', 'such', 'experience', 'recommend', 'movie', 'not', 'view', 'woman', 'who', 'not', 'raising', 'kids', 'right', 'being', 'too', 'selfish', 'rather', 'look', 'how', 'one', 'can', 'provide', 'far', 'greater', 'opportunity', 'one', 'children', 'bold', 'adventure', 'how', 'many', 'children', 'miss', 'out', 'parents', 'do', 'not', 'provide', 'opportunity.Hideous', 'Kinky', 'Novel']",N/A

17157,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0767823931,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[14, 14]","""Hideous Kinky"" is based on an autobiographical novel by Esther Freud (Sigmund's great-granddaughter, not that this means anything in terms of the story) and stars Kate Winslet as Julia, a young British woman who has traveled to Marrakech in 1972 with her two young daughters in tow, 8-year old Bea (Bella Riza) and 6-year old Lucy (Carrie Mullan).  Julia seems to be living in this exotic world because is a truth-seeker, but she is also running away from her life in London, where she caught her ""husband"" (i.e., the man who fathered her children), cheating on her.  He is supposed to be sending them checks and care passages from home, but what usually happens is that the checks never arrive or are less than expected while the packages are intended for his ""other"" family.This film holds us at a distance because the perspective is not so much that of the mother as it is of the daughters.  Conveniently one of them is game for being dragged around a foreign land while the other becomes rebellious.  The world does seemed turned upside down when a young girl tells her hippie mother: ""I don't need another adventure, Mom.  I need to go to school.  I need to learn things.""  Julia wants to understand Sufi philosophy and find inner peace.  Her daughters would like to taste rice pudding again (every time the older one has something to say the younger one announces the fact).It is not so much that the movie condemns Julia as it is that it fails to understand her, largely because she clearly does not understand herself.  Throughout the film director Gillies MacKinnon uses familiar songs by the likes of Jefferson Airplane and Richie Havens to substitute for action and to provide the film with the appropriate vibe.  If these songs are being played loudly then what Julia is doing in a strange land with her children must be a good thing because these are good songs.Yet we come to the conclusion that this what matters here in the end is not going to be a quest for enlightenment but simply the effort by Julia to get out of Morocco alive with both of her girls.  However the crucial factor in this appears to be neither Julia nor the Europeans with whom she has some connections in Morocco, but Bilal (Said Taghamoui), a street performer who may be running from the policy and who becomes not only Julia's lover but a father figure of sorts to the girls.  He may be a rogue, but he is a charming one and we have reason to believe that he cares about these women, even if he is ultimately powerless to help them.In the end ""Hideous Kinky"" is more about people and a place more than anything else.  The performances, including Winslet's first after the mega-success of ""Titanic,"" are certainly solid enough.  But memorable moments in this film are more likely to be when a familiar song, such as America's ""Horse With No Name,"" pops up while Julia and the girls are hitchhiking across the desert.  We get a sense of the culture of Morocco, but no real understanding of it, any more than Julia really understands herself any better in the end.  But what we see is captivating enough that like Julia's children, we go along for the adventure.",4,A woman finds herself in Morocco trying to find herself,1096070400,"09 25, 2004",2004,3149,"['Hideous', 'Kinky', 'based', 'autobiographical', 'novel', 'Esther', 'Freud', 'Sigmund', 'great-granddaughter', 'not', 'anything', 'terms', 'story', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Julia', 'young', 'British', 'woman', 'who', 'traveled', 'Marrakech', '1972', 'two', 'young', 'daughters', 'tow', '8-year', 'old', 'Bea', 'Bella', 'Riza', '6-year', 'old', 'Lucy', 'Carrie', 'Mullan', 'Julia', 'be', 'living', 'exotic', 'world', 'truth-seeker', 'also', 'running', 'away', 'life', 'London', 'where', 'caught', 'husband', 'i.e.', 'man', 'who', 'fathered', 'children', 'cheating', 'supposed', 'be', 'sending', 'checks', 'care', 'passages', 'home', 'what', 'usually', 'checks', 'never', 'arrive', 'are', 'less', 'expected', 'packages', 'are', 'intended', 'other', 'family.This', 'film', 'distance', 'perspective', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'mother', 'daughters', 'Conveniently', 'one', 'game', 'being', 'dragged', 'foreign', 'land', 'other', 'rebellious', 'world', 'seemed', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'young', 'girl', 'hippie', 'mother', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'adventure', 'Mom', 'need', 'go', 'school', 'need', 'learn', 'things', 'Julia', 'understand', 'Sufi', 'philosophy', 'find', 'inner', 'peace', 'daughters', 'would', 'like', 'taste', 'rice', 'pudding', 'again', 'time', 'older', 'one', 'something', 'say', 'younger', 'one', 'fact', '.It', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'condemns', 'Julia', 'understand', 'largely', 'clearly', 'not', 'understand', 'film', 'director', 'Gillies', 'MacKinnon', 'familiar', 'songs', 'likes', 'Jefferson', 'Airplane', 'Richie', 'Havens', 'substitute', 'action', 'provide', 'film', 'appropriate', 'vibe', 'songs', 'are', 'being', 'played', 'loudly', 'then', 'what', 'Julia', 'doing', 'strange', 'land', 'children', 'must', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'are', 'good', 'songs.Yet', 'come', 'conclusion', 'what', 'here', 'end', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'quest', 'enlightenment', 'simply', 'effort', 'Julia', 'get', 'Morocco', 'alive', 'girls', 'However', 'crucial', 'factor', 'be', 'neither', 'Julia', 'Europeans', 'whom', 'connections', 'Morocco', 'Bilal', 'Said', 'Taghamoui', 'street', 'performer', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'running', 'policy', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'Julia', 'lover', 'father', 'figure', 'sorts', 'girls', 'may', 'be', 'rogue', 'charming', 'one', 'have', 'reason', 'believe', 'women', 'even', 'ultimately', 'powerless', 'help', 'them.In', 'end', 'Hideous', 'Kinky', 'more', 'people', 'place', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'performances', 'including', 'Winslet', 'first', 'mega-success', 'Titanic', 'are', 'certainly', 'solid', 'enough', 'memorable', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'when', 'familiar', 'song', 'such', 'America', 'Horse', 'No', 'Name', 'up', 'Julia', 'girls', 'are', 'hitchhiking', 'desert', 'get', 'sense', 'culture', 'Morocco', 'real', 'understanding', 'more', 'Julia', 'really', 'better', 'end', 'what', 'see', 'captivating', 'enough', 'Julia', 'children', 'go', 'along', 'adventure']",N/A

Taking place in the early 1970s, it is very reminiscent of an era now passed, an era when ""flower power"" was the rule of the day.Here, Kate Winslet plays Julia, a twenty five year old young mother of two children, nine year old Bea, stunningly acted by Bella Riza, and her younger sister, Lucy, charmingly played by Carrie Mullen. They abandon their structured, staid life in London, when Julia decides to leave their father to go to Marrakech in Morocco, then the capitol of the disaffected, in search of spiritual enlightenment.Taking her children, Julia goes on an adventure, an adventure to which Lucy, the younger of her two daughters, takes to almost immediately. Nine year old Bea, on the other hand, begins to yearn for a more ""normal"", structured life. Julia, however, will have none of it. Living in a Moroccan slum with her girls, she romanticizes their existence.Julia becomes involved with Bilal, a street performer of sorts, who looks out for them. Wonderfully acted by Said Taghemaoui, Bilal charms Julia and her daughters. He cannot, however, support them, and they cannot support themselves. This becomes clear as they begin a rag tag journey into the Moroccan country side.Sooner, rather than later, reality sets in. The adventure wears thin on Bea who becomes estranged from her mother. The harsh reality of every day life confronts Julia, who ultimately realizes that traipsing around Morocco just puts her young daughters at risk. Unfortuntely, this realization does not occur to her until she almost loses Bea to illness. It is then that Bilal steps up to home plate and gives them the means to return. They leave Marrakech to begin their journey home, taking with them enough memories to last a lifetime.This is a wonderful movie with exceptional cinematography.

While we churn out mind-numbingly trite fare like 'Not another teen movie', the UK and France constantly challenge us with exhilarating creations like 'The Dreamlife of Angels' and 'Les Parapluies de Cherbourg'. In this particular case, the film in question is 'Hideous Kinky', a little-seen, but revered film for fans of novelist Esther Freud. A strictly Brit-only dominion ensures that the crisp diction of a language oft mistreated comes through in dazzling perfection, and Kate Winslet proves why she is perhaps one of the best actresses we have in our midst today.This film has no story, really. Its more or less a collection of vignettes focussing on a mother and her two children in Marrakesch, Morroco. In Germany, producers decided for aeons before deciding that the German version of the film couldn't possibly be titled 'Hideous Kinky' and they then decided on the plain 'Marrakech' as the movie's name. The mother, played by Kate, is a young British woman who has dragged her two young daughters to Morocco in search of spiritual understanding. Its all set in the '60s and if you can find yourself the out of print soundtrack to the movie, GRAB IT! Its a find worth keeping.The movie traces Kate's attempts to make sense, and some money, in a country she has embraced, but has its own problems in embracing her back. Her kids however, blend straight into the scenery without a problem. And what a scenery it is! This is perhaps the most beautiful Morocco has looked on film, and thats no careless statement. Through the course of the film, Kate falls in love with a handsome Islamic rogue, who falls so hard for her that he moves heaven and earth to get them back to England when they fall upon hard times. He knows he won't see them again, yet is willing to put his life in jeopardy for their happiness.I loved this movie because its exactly the sort of film I enjoy. Its MUCH better than Kate's other Eastern influenced movie 'Holy Smoke'. Its also very refreshing to see how films such as these still pop up in an era where blockbusters have taken a front seat in the world of film-making.I recently understood that this DVD is out of print, which means that the studio is no longer producing it. Amazon.com is one of the few online merchants who still have a few copies of the movie so I highly recommend you get your hands on this rarity before it disappears from the public eye completely!

Based upon Emma Freud's  beguiling novel, the film attempts to translate (the main character)  Julia's hippie-era 'search for meaning' in exotic Marrakech. While not  enough time is spent delving into the deep reasons for Julia's dash from  London for the often squalid conditions of Morrocco with two young  daughters in tow, the location scenes are powerfully done. Julia's  spiritual search is not idealized in the film and neither are her  surroundings--Morrocco is shown with all of its luster and languor. Thus,  the viewer is treated to the possibilities such a journey for the soul  might bring--sickness, hunger, assault, theft, and many glimpses into a  truly mesmerizing culture. The overall effect is one of visual fascination  with Moroccan scenery (both pretty and putrid) and gentle, almost detached,  curiosity about Julia's string of misadventures. The main conflict, of  course, is Julia's naive belief that her structureless expedition will not  have any serious consequences for her two daughters, especially Bea. Her  affair with Bilal is also misleading to their fragile psyches.  Kate  Winslet portrays Julia with ravishing flair. She comes across as perfectly  brilliant and senseless at the same time...no small acting accomplishment!  This film will captivate the world-traveler or the dreamer in a soft,  leisurely manner. It will toy with the intelligent imagination and linger  like the smell of rain long after the summer storm has passed. Those who  are not of an artistic bent may find it a trifle dull and difficult to  follow.

Stathoulopoulos ""nick9155""","[3, 5]","Hideous Kinky is based on Esther Freud's novel, told from a child's point of view, of a strange family journey through Morocco in the early 1970s.  Kate Winslett is the young mother who has left behind the stability of a flat in central London, work, and a husband.  She drags her two young girls through the dusty and beautiful landscapes of Morocco, all the while searching for something she believes is out there.The theatrical trailer for this film was very odd--all I remember about is that I wanted to see the film for some reason.  Not your typical Hollywood fare by a long shot, it's Winslett's first major film after Titantic, I believe.  Quite a departure in terms of production, however, still a very good role for her.  Over time, the characters find themselves lost in more ways than one, meeting up with and losing and finding Bilal, a Moroccan man who offers a fascinating counterpoint to these atypical English travellers.  The selfishness of the main character becomes more clear as we watch the children suffer through confusion, discomfort, and a suspended reality while mommy flirts with spirituality.This is not for everyone.  It's not a chick flick, it's not exactly a travelogue (though it approaches that format most often), nor is it a melodrama by any means.  Taking place in the early 1970s it plays with the notions of the hippie or the pseudo-hippie, bucking the system yet stressing the notion that the system has irrevocably molded you.  You may feel for the characters, or you may feel contempt at the irresponsible choices.There's also a great soundtrack on CD.  The theatrical trailer made it's point with Jefferson Airplane's classic Somebody to Love, while there's also Nick Drake, Canned Heat, and some regional music from Morocco as well.The film is a real treat and is highly recommended if you want a recognizable star in a non-Hollywood setting, and if you want an insight into the nomadic handling of young children by a confused parent.",4,"Spirit of the 60s, man",1047772800,"03 16, 2003",2003,1979,"['Hideous', 'Kinky', 'based', 'Esther', 'Freud', 'novel', 'told', 'child', 'point', 'view', 'strange', 'family', 'journey', 'Morocco', 'early', '1970s', 'Kate', 'Winslett', 'young', 'mother', 'who', 'left', 'stability', 'flat', 'central', 'London', 'work', 'husband', 'two', 'young', 'girls', 'dusty', 'beautiful', 'landscapes', 'Morocco', 'while', 'searching', 'something', 'out', 'there.The', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'odd', 'remember', 'wanted', 'see', 'film', 'reason', 'Not', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'long', 'shot', 'Winslett', 'first', 'major', 'film', 'Titantic', 'believe', 'departure', 'terms', 'production', 'however', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'role', 'time', 'characters', 'find', 'lost', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'meeting', 'up', 'losing', 'finding', 'Bilal', 'Moroccan', 'man', 'who', 'fascinating', 'counterpoint', 'atypical', 'English', 'travellers', 'selfishness', 'main', 'character', 'more', 'clear', 'watch', 'children', 'suffer', 'confusion', 'discomfort', 'suspended', 'reality', 'mommy', 'flirts', 'spirituality.This', 'not', 'everyone', 'not', 'chick', 'flick', 'not', 'exactly', 'travelogue', 'format', 'most', 'often', 'melodrama', 'means', 'Taking', 'place', 'early', '1970s', 'notions', 'hippie', 'pseudo-hippie', 'bucking', 'system', 'yet', 'stressing', 'notion', 'system', 'irrevocably', 'molded', 'may', 'feel', 'characters', 'may', 'feel', 'contempt', 'irresponsible', 'choices.There', 'also', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'CD', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'made', 'point', 'Jefferson', 'Airplane', 'classic', 'Somebody', 'Love', 'also', 'Nick', 'Drake', 'Canned', 'Heat', 'regional', 'music', 'Morocco', 'well.The', 'film', 'real', 'treat', 'highly', 'recommended', 'want', 'recognizable', 'star', 'non-Hollywood', 'setting', 'want', 'insight', 'nomadic', 'handling', 'young', 'children', 'confused', 'parent']",N/A

17168,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0767823931,Reviewer,"[4, 4]","Though the ""Beat"" generation of the `50s may have been the genesis of it all, there is no doubt that the `60s spawned an accelerated social upheaval like nothing that came before it.  It was an era that was to become synonymous with uninhibited freedom and free love, as well as a quest for change and enlightenment on a variety of levels.  ""Hideous Kinky,"" directed by Gillies MacKinnon, has it's roots in that `60s sensibility, but the story picks up in the early `70s in Marrakech, Morocco, where a twenty-five year old mother of two has come seeking not only enlightenment, but a means to effect the ""annihilation of the ego.""  Kate Winslet stars as Julia, who has left her home in London behind, as well as her children's father, in order to pursue her quest for spiritual freedom.  But, as often happens when reality sets in, that quest becomes something of a trial in itself, as life becomes a matter of living hand to mouth, depending upon the generosity of others-- in many cases strangers-- and unfortunately at times putting not only Julia, but her two young daughters in peril for their lives.  As a friend tells her early on in the film, in response to her reaction to the brutality to which he is subjected at work, ""This isn't London--""  And had she been a bit more astute, those simple words from her friend would've been all the enlightenment she needed.  But to one with an eye on the prize and an adamant attitude, such simple wisdom is rarely perceptible, and-- as in Julia's case-- more often than not will go unheeded, as it does here.  There's beauty in much of what Julia encounters on her journey, but mostly it's something of a travelogue for places to avoid at any cost; and the film is disconcerting in that the audience-- as an impartial observer-- can readily discern the futility of Julia's endeavors, and the fact that her children are subjected to it, as well, is unnerving at times.  Of course, hindsight is always the nectar of the gods, and it's easy to see the ""big picture"" when you're able to view it at arm's length.  There is no question that her quest is admirable, but because this is a person you come to like early on-- her personal qualities and motivations are beyond reproach; it's her decisions that are questionable-- it is frustrating to watch her muddle her way through (even during the happier moments) when it all seems so unnecessary, somehow.  What is required, perhaps, is a thorough understanding of the times, and the attitudes effectuated by them; for the allurement of an awareness that can effect spiritual release is compelling, and the wisdom thought to be afforded by the fool on the hill can be an irresistible enticement even today.  You have to admire Winslet for taking on a fairly unglamorous, though somewhat sympathetic role, after her mainstream success in ""Titanic.""  With what I'm sure must have been a plethora of plum parts from which to choose, rather than play it safe she took the daring route and determined upon a project with character and substance.  And though Julia may not be her most memorable creation, there is no question that her performance here is the highlight of the film.  She lends an earthy, endearing quality to the character that make her not only likable, but believable; and because you sense the danger of her situation, it evokes a feeling of uneasiness that cannot be dispelled.  It also makes you empathize with those whose loved ones embarked upon journeys similar to Julia's during this era; and there were many.  The supporting cast includes Said Taghmaoui (Bilal), Bella Riza (Bea), Carrie Mullan (Lucy), Pierre Clementi (Santoni), Abigail Cruttenden (Charlotte), Ahmed Bouland (Ben Said), Sira Stampe (Eva) and Amidou (Sufi Sheikh).  A film that prompts emotional involvement on a number of levels, ""Hideous Kinky"" is a paean of sorts to those who seek the fulfillment of a better way of life, and are willing to take the road less traveled to find it.  And the strength of Winslet's performance alone makes it a film worth seeing.  In her previous outing, she may have had a beautiful blue jewel to wear around her neck, but in this one, she ""is"" the jewel.

17170,A2ZKKJKTBKJYEK,0767823931,"""sopera""","[3, 3]","Set in Morocco in 1972, &quot;Hideous Kinky&quot; is a gem. The acting, music and cinemetography all come together to create a wonderfully free-spirited, original film.Each of the characters in &quot;Hideous Kinky&quot; is on a quest. Julia, a smart, slightly immature and selfish young mother, seeks spiritual enlightenment through Sufism and &quot;the school of the annihilation of the ego.&quot; Lucy, her younger daughter, surveys the world through bright eyes and tries to learn all she can  from it (by the end of the film, she speaks Arabic with Bilal and wraps her head in a turban!). Bea, the older daughter, wants nothing more than to go to school and &quot;be normal,&quot; in spite of her eccentric family. During their days in Marakkesh they meet Bilal, a charming street performer with a shady past who becomes Julia's lover, steps in as the girls' surrogate father and, ultimately, saves them all.The film wanders along with Julia and her family: one minute, they are enjoying music in a square in Marakkesh; later, they are hitchhiking through the desert en route to Algeria. It's different, and it is fitting to both the characters and the story.Several scenes in the film are dream sequences, and, overall, &quot;Hideous Kinky&quot; has a surreal, dreamlike quality. The viewer really picks up the atmosphere of Morocco through the various places Julia and her children visit.This was the first Kate Winslet film I had ever seen, and I was impressed with her portrayal of Julia. As other reviewers have mentioned, Bella Riza and Carrie Mullan, as Winslet's young daughters, are also outstanding.There is one major gripe I have with this video. When I saw &quot;Hideous Kinky&quot; at the cinema overseas, all of the Arabic dialogue was subtitled. In this American release video, however, there aren't any subtitles AT ALL. Hence, anglophone viewers might have only a marginal idea of what is happening in some of the film's important scenes--such as Bilal's street show (all about the meaning of life, which is a central theme to the movie!) and his conversations with Fatima and the ticket seller.ALl in all, though, I think this is a great addition to anyone's video library--particularly those who have also enjoyed roaming around the world!",5,"Unique and Riveting, but where are the subtitles?",986428800,"04 5, 2001",2001,2262,"['Set', 'Morocco', '1972', 'quot', 'Hideous', 'Kinky', 'quot', 'gem', 'acting', 'music', 'cinemetography', 'come', 'together', 'create', 'wonderfully', 'free-spirited', 'original', 'film.Each', 'characters', 'quot', 'Hideous', 'Kinky', 'quot', 'quest', 'Julia', 'smart', 'slightly', 'immature', 'selfish', 'young', 'mother', 'spiritual', 'enlightenment', 'Sufism', 'quot', 'school', 'annihilation', 'ego.', 'quot', 'Lucy', 'younger', 'daughter', 'surveys', 'world', 'bright', 'eyes', 'tries', 'learn', 'can', 'end', 'film', 'Arabic', 'Bilal', 'wraps', 'head', 'turban', 'Bea', 'older', 'daughter', 'nothing', 'more', 'go', 'school', 'quot', 'be', 'normal', 'quot', 'spite', 'eccentric', 'family', 'days', 'Marakkesh', 'meet', 'Bilal', 'charming', 'street', 'performer', 'shady', 'past', 'who', 'Julia', 'lover', 'steps', 'girls', 'surrogate', 'father', 'ultimately', 'all.The', 'film', 'wanders', 'Julia', 'family', 'one', 'minute', 'are', 'enjoying', 'music', 'square', 'Marakkesh', 'later', 'are', 'hitchhiking', 'desert', 'route', 'Algeria', 'different', 'fitting', 'characters', 'story.Several', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'dream', 'sequences', 'overall', 'quot', 'Hideous', 'Kinky', 'quot', 'surreal', 'dreamlike', 'quality', 'viewer', 'really', 'up', 'atmosphere', 'Morocco', 'various', 'places', 'Julia', 'children', 'visit.This', 'was', 'first', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'film', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'was', 'impressed', 'portrayal', 'Julia', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'Bella', 'Riza', 'Carrie', 'Mullan', 'Winslet', 'young', 'daughters', 'are', 'also', 'outstanding.There', 'one', 'major', 'gripe', 'have', 'video', 'When', 'saw', 'quot', 'Hideous', 'Kinky', 'quot', 'cinema', 'overseas', 'Arabic', 'dialogue', 'was', 'subtitled', 'American', 'release', 'video', 'however', 'are', ""n't"", 'subtitles', 'AT', 'ALL', 'Hence', 'anglophone', 'viewers', 'might', 'have', 'only', 'marginal', 'idea', 'what', 'happening', 'film', 'important', 'scenes', 'such', 'Bilal', 'street', 'show', 'meaning', 'life', 'central', 'theme', 'movie', 'conversations', 'Fatima', 'ticket', 'seller.ALl', 'think', 'great', 'addition', 'anyone', 'video', 'library', 'particularly', 'who', 'have', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'roaming', 'world']",N/A
17171,A3MEGCL9WU0U1R,0767823931,Stephen G. Melvin,"[46, 50]","Off-beat, original, and a masterpiece. That is Hideous Kinky in a nutshell. Kate Winslett was once an actress I held in contempt for that horrid movie Titanic. Since then, however, she has redeemed herself.  Playing most notably, Ophelia in Branagh's Hamlet, and the delightfully  sinful cousin in the adaptation of Thomas Hardy's novel Jude. This movie is  no exception. Here she plays an English expatriate living in Moracco. She  has taken her two small children and the three of them live in poverty  waiting on the next check from the children's careless father, who is a  poet in England. As Winslett continues her neverending seach for inner  enlightenment and her obsession with the sufi, she becomes as neglectful to  the children as their father is. It is a tale about a woman who desires  freedom, but is torn by responsibility.Supporting Winslet is an  excellent cast of unknows. Playing her love interest, Bilal, is Sad  Taghmaoui, who handles his role excellently. Perhaps most impressive are  the two little girls. Older Bea, who just wants to be normal, is played by  Bella Riza. Carrie Mullan is younger Lucy, who is still trying to  understand what her wild life means.Director Gillies MacKinnon does a  wonderful job of portraying the foreign landscape and capturing the overall  feel of Moracco. Based on the novel by Esther Freud (yes, she is in the  direct lineage of old Siggy) this movie is not a typical flick, which is  what makes it so nice. A refreshing break from the run-of-the-mill  Hollywood movie, this may be the best movie the world never saw.",4,Not your typical Hollywood movie--thank God.,947894400,"01 15, 2000",2000,1578,"['Off-beat', 'original', 'masterpiece', 'Hideous', 'Kinky', 'nutshell', 'Kate', 'Winslett', 'was', 'once', 'actress', 'held', 'contempt', 'horrid', 'movie', 'Titanic', 'then', 'however', 'redeemed', 'Playing', 'most', 'notably', 'Ophelia', 'Branagh', 'Hamlet', 'delightfully', 'sinful', 'cousin', 'adaptation', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'novel', 'Jude', 'movie', 'exception', 'Here', 'English', 'expatriate', 'living', 'Moracco', 'taken', 'two', 'small', 'children', 'three', 'live', 'poverty', 'waiting', 'next', 'check', 'children', 'careless', 'father', 'who', 'poet', 'England', 'Winslett', 'neverending', 'seach', 'inner', 'enlightenment', 'obsession', 'sufi', 'as', 'neglectful', 'children', 'father', 'tale', 'woman', 'who', 'freedom', 'torn', 'responsibility.Supporting', 'Winslet', 'excellent', 'cast', 'unknows', 'Playing', 'love', 'interest', 'Bilal', 'Sad', 'Taghmaoui', 'who', 'role', 'excellently', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'impressive', 'are', 'two', 'little', 'girls', 'Older', 'Bea', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'normal', 'played', 'Bella', 'Riza', 'Carrie', 'Mullan', 'younger', 'Lucy', 'who', 'still', 'trying', 'understand', 'what', 'wild', 'life', 'means.Director', 'Gillies', 'MacKinnon', 'wonderful', 'job', 'portraying', 'foreign', 'landscape', 'capturing', 'overall', 'feel', 'Moracco', 'Based', 'novel', 'Esther', 'Freud', 'yes', 'direct', 'lineage', 'old', 'Siggy', 'movie', 'not', 'typical', 'flick', 'what', 'so', 'nice', 'refreshing', 'break', 'run-of-the-mill', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'movie', 'world', 'never', 'saw']",N/A
