I thought that Spookie Ookie was a more frightening character than Gloomius Maximus, but neither ever bothered her. This from child who won't watch Toy Story 2 because she's afraid of Zurg.The quality of the graphics looks different, almost like they filmed it instead of using video - if that can make sense. It's not as crisp, but it's just fine for a toddler (remember, it's not made for us digital freaks!) :-)I read comments regarding the style of the writing/story line. Nothing like that was readily apparent to me, just as it wasn't to my daughter (at least she didn't make any such observation - that'd really be something! and she can read some - so she's no dummy). :-)I say that, if your child is a Rolie Polie Olie fan, they'll like the movie. You may not want to invest in a DVD since the quality isn't really as good as typical digital video, but you could also just keep that in mind.Enjoy! :-)",4,Great fun,1030233600,"08 25, 2002",2002,1048,"['3.5', 'yr', 'old', 'daughter', 'who', 'loved', 'Rolie', 'Polie', 'Olie', 'forever', 'who', 'videos', 'loved', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'scare', 'thought', 'Spookie', 'Ookie', 'was', 'more', 'frightening', 'character', 'Gloomius', 'Maximus', 'ever', 'bothered', 'child', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Toy', 'Story', '2', 'afraid', 'Zurg.The', 'quality', 'graphics', 'different', 'almost', 'filmed', 'instead', 'using', 'video', 'can', 'make', 'sense', 'not', 'crisp', 'just', 'fine', 'toddler', 'remember', 'not', 'made', 'digital', 'freaks', 'read', 'comments', 'regarding', 'style', 'writing/story', 'line', 'Nothing', 'was', 'readily', 'apparent', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'daughter', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'such', 'observation', ""'d"", 'really', 'be', 'something', 'can', 'read', 'dummy', 'say', 'child', 'Rolie', 'Polie', 'Olie', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'like', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'invest', 'DVD', 'quality', ""n't"", 'really', 'as', 'good', 'typical', 'digital', 'video', 'could', 'also', 'just', 'keep', 'mind.Enjoy']",N/A

My 2-1/2 year old is a big fan of ""Rolie Polie Olie"" and was very disappointed in this movie. The animation, for some reason, has lost its computer-generated fluidity and is a jittery headache to watch and the usual slow-paced and charming writing is gone and been replaced with your standard good guy/bad guy conflict and lots of frenetic racing around. Everytime ""Gloomius Maximus"" came on, my daughter asked me to fast forward it because he scared her. Eventually, my daughter picked up one of her books and wandered off...

704863,AJC962LFF93VC,B000068MBN,Michael Gebert,"[0, 0]","This first feature-length Olie video will obviously please children who are fans of this show; it's reminiscent in its plotting of the old Rankin/Bass Christmas specials, with a bad guy who sings to explain the roots of his badness and really just needs cheering up.  (Instead of Paul Frees, he's voiced by no less  than James Woods.)Adults may feel slightly disconcerted that the very qualities that make the show so suitable for toddlers-- the simple 3-D graphics (more geometric yet no less versatile than Toy Story), the child-sized cast of characters (the Polies live in a world of about 10 people, just like a child does), and the low-key, kid-manageable stories and conflicts-- have been blown up to Hollywood size in a story that's busier, noisier and just generally more dramatic than the TV series.  Rolie Polie Olie has often been a refuge for my family from that kind of kid video.  And then there's the truly bizarre fact (as several people have noted) that the studio dropped the animation's frame rate from a video 30 frames per second (like the TV series) to a film-like 24 fps-- a common enough trick for digital video independent films to make them look more like film, but something that will presumably be lost on most three year olds!  Unfortunately, it means that this video doesn't quite have the seamless look of the TV series itself.If you're (the parent of) an Olie fan, you will surely add this to your video collection, but if you don't know the show, you're probably better off checking out some of the actual episodes before seeing this bigger, louder, Hollywoodized version.",3,Sweet little show has gone Hollywood,1030579200,"08 29, 2002",2002,1605,"['first', 'feature-length', 'Olie', 'video', 'will', 'obviously', 'please', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'show', 'reminiscent', 'plotting', 'old', 'Rankin/Bass', 'Christmas', 'specials', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'explain', 'roots', 'badness', 'really', 'just', 'needs', 'cheering', 'up', 'Instead', 'Paul', 'Frees', 'voiced', 'less', 'James', 'Woods', 'Adults', 'may', 'feel', 'slightly', 'disconcerted', 'very', 'make', 'show', 'so', 'suitable', 'toddlers', 'simple', '3-D', 'graphics', 'more', 'geometric', 'yet', 'less', 'versatile', 'Toy', 'Story', 'child-sized', 'cast', 'characters', 'Polies', 'live', 'world', '10', 'people', 'just', 'child', 'low-key', 'kid-manageable', 'stories', 'conflicts', 'have', 'been', 'blown', 'up', 'Hollywood', 'size', 'story', 'busier', 'noisier', 'just', 'generally', 'more', 'dramatic', 'TV', 'series', 'Rolie', 'Polie', 'Olie', 'often', 'been', 'refuge', 'family', 'kind', 'kid', 'video', 'then', 'truly', 'bizarre', 'fact', 'several', 'people', 'have', 'noted', 'studio', 'dropped', 'animation', 'frame', 'rate', 'video', '30', 'frames', 'second', 'TV', 'series', 'film-like', '24', 'fps', 'common', 'enough', 'trick', 'digital', 'video', 'independent', 'films', 'make', 'look', 'more', 'film', 'something', 'will', 'presumably', 'be', 'lost', 'most', 'three', 'year', 'olds', 'Unfortunately', 'video', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'seamless', 'look', 'TV', 'series', 'itself.If', ""'re"", 'parent', 'Olie', 'fan', 'will', 'surely', 'add', 'video', 'collection', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'show', ""'re"", 'probably', 'better', 'off', 'checking', 'out', 'actual', 'episodes', 'seeing', 'bigger', 'louder', 'Hollywoodized', 'version']",N/A

I was not surprised to learn that the Rolie Polie Olie series was made in Canada...things seem to be neater and cleaner north of the border (see 'Canadian Bacon' if you don't know what I mean).  for some reason the 'Leave It To Beaver' lifestyle still thrives up in the Great White North.But the bottom line here folks is my 2 1/2-yr-old loves this DVD, and you can't trust an adult critic to understand what this movie is all about.  I am amazed at the accent James Woods puts on for Gloomy, I thought it was Bob Hoskins!  The characters are cute, the plot interesting enough to hold a young child's imagination and attention, and overall I think (and my youngest son seems to agree) that this is a great kids movie.  It just proves that you don't need to be sugary-sweet or overcompensate with glitzy special effects to win kids over.
