1554123,A1CV150BFI5TKT,B008IG0E7M,AdamS1990,"[0, 0]","Before I begin, let me tell you that I had been anticipating this DVD since it was first mentioned by Punk himself during his tirade on his way to winning the gold at Money In The Bank 2011. Throughout the time it took to produce this set, there details that came to surface about it's documentary that got me even more interested in the set. Not only does this set include a stellar, one of a kind documentary; but it also contains a great set of matches looking back on his run through the WWE and his rise to the top.The Documentary:From the opening minute, straight-on through to the crazy/silly last words by punk after the credits, you can see the extraordinary amount of hands-on work Punk himself has put in to this film. This translates to a wonderful, and inspiring look into Punk's career, including some very ""insider"" stuff. Everything from child-hood, to his money in the bank win, and a few events that follow; this covers all of CM Punks best career highs & lows, in bot the indys and WWE. I will not spoil much of the actual documentary; but the stories Punk provides on how he was held back, and how he was rewarded, make for a remarkable story of that one guy who wasn't suppose to make it big in his line of work, but he broke through that ""glass-ceiling"" to become the biggest star in his industry.The extras - I can't see why most of these cut-scenes weren't included on the actual documentary portion of disc 1. Anyway, there all great stories, and should be watched right after the doc, as they really help it come full circle.Disc 1 Score: 5/5This has to be the most entertaining WWE documentary to be released sinceRic Flair & The Four Horsemen. A lot of Insider information on the wrestling business, and Punk's overall struggles through-out his career, make it a very entertaining watch for even a non-wrestling fan. This is gold.The Matches:Many will complain that there are no ROH or other Indy matches on here, but I don't think it's any kind of blemish. Want his ROH matches? Well then, buy his ROH sets, I believe someone sells them here on Amazon. I personally think this is a great match listing, that really saves his classics for the last disc, while the preceding disc does feature a few promos, and some above average-matches, including his first few championship victories in his early WWE career. All TV matches on disc 2 are free of commercials, and make for a nice, quick watch. Meanwhile, disc 3 contains five of my favorite matches in the last few years, and each match is excellent. His infamous TLC match with Hardy, the match where he loses his hair, his huge money in the bank main event with Cena; this whole disc is gold, and is a treat for any wrestling fan.Discs 2 & 3 Score: 4.5/5This is really a great overview of CM Punk's career so far in the WWE, covering his early debut, and climb through the ranks, on disc 2; and his best big matches covered on disc 3. Both disc 2 & 3 are easy viewing, with disc three containing 5 matches that I personally rate at/above 4 1/2 stars. I would provide a match list, but everyone else has one, and we should all know how awesome this DVD/BD really is by now.Overall score: *****5/5 StarsThis has to be the best Superstar focused set since eitherWWE: Bret ""Hitman"" Hart - The Best There Is, The Best There Was, The Best There Ever Will BeorRic Flair & The Four Horsemen. When you pick the dvd/bd up, you're getting a great documentary, and an awesome match listing featuring classic matches and all the video packages available to hype them. A must own DVD or Blu-ray for wrestling fans, and a DVD that will even entertain those who're not that into wrestling.",5,"An amazing retrospective on CM Punk's great career in, and out, of the WWE",1350604800,"10 19, 2012",2012,3653,"['begin', 'let', 'tell', 'had', 'been', 'anticipating', 'DVD', 'was', 'first', 'mentioned', 'Punk', 'tirade', 'way', 'winning', 'gold', 'Money', 'Bank', '2011', 'time', 'took', 'produce', 'set', 'details', 'came', 'surface', 'documentary', 'got', 'even', 'more', 'interested', 'set', 'Not', 'only', 'set', 'include', 'stellar', 'one', 'kind', 'documentary', 'also', 'great', 'set', 'matches', 'looking', 'back', 'run', 'WWE', 'rise', 'top.The', 'Documentary', 'opening', 'minute', 'straight-on', 'crazy/silly', 'last', 'words', 'punk', 'credits', 'can', 'see', 'extraordinary', 'amount', 'hands-on', 'work', 'Punk', 'put', 'film', 'wonderful', 'inspiring', 'look', 'Punk', 'career', 'including', 'very', 'insider', 'stuff', 'Everything', 'child-hood', 'money', 'bank', 'win', 'few', 'events', 'follow', 'CM', 'Punks', 'best', 'career', 'highs', 'lows', 'indys', 'WWE', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'much', 'actual', 'documentary', 'stories', 'Punk', 'how', 'was', 'held', 'back', 'how', 'was', 'rewarded', 'make', 'remarkable', 'story', 'one', 'guy', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'suppose', 'make', 'big', 'line', 'work', 'broke', 'glass-ceiling', 'become', 'biggest', 'star', 'industry.The', 'extras', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'most', 'cut-scenes', 'were', ""n't"", 'included', 'actual', 'documentary', 'portion', 'disc', '1', 'Anyway', 'great', 'stories', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'right', 'doc', 'really', 'help', 'come', 'full', 'circle.Disc', '1', 'Score', '5/5This', 'be', 'most', 'entertaining', 'WWE', 'documentary', 'be', 'released', 'sinceRic', 'Flair', 'Four', 'Horsemen', 'lot', 'Insider', 'information', 'wrestling', 'business', 'Punk', 'overall', 'through-out', 'career', 'make', 'very', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'even', 'non-wrestling', 'fan', 'gold.The', 'Matches', 'Many', 'will', 'complain', 'are', 'ROH', 'other', 'Indy', 'matches', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'kind', 'blemish', 'Want', 'ROH', 'matches', 'Well', 'then', 'buy', 'ROH', 'sets', 'believe', 'someone', 'here', 'Amazon', 'personally', 'think', 'great', 'match', 'listing', 'really', 'classics', 'last', 'disc', 'preceding', 'disc', 'feature', 'few', 'promos', 'average-matches', 'including', 'first', 'few', 'championship', 'victories', 'early', 'WWE', 'career', 'TV', 'matches', 'disc', '2', 'are', 'free', 'commercials', 'make', 'nice', 'quick', 'watch', 'Meanwhile', 'disc', '3', 'contains', 'five', 'favorite', 'matches', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'match', 'excellent', 'infamous', 'TLC', 'match', 'Hardy', 'match', 'where', 'hair', 'huge', 'money', 'bank', 'main', 'event', 'Cena', 'whole', 'disc', 'gold', 'treat', 'wrestling', 'fan.Discs', '2', '3', 'Score', '4.5/5This', 'really', 'great', 'overview', 'CM', 'Punk', 'career', 'so', 'far', 'WWE', 'covering', 'early', 'debut', 'climb', 'ranks', 'disc', '2', 'best', 'big', 'matches', 'covered', 'disc', '3', '2', '3', 'are', 'easy', 'viewing', 'disc', 'three', 'containing', '5', 'matches', 'personally', 'rate', 'at/above', '4', '1/2', 'stars', 'would', 'provide', 'match', 'list', 'everyone', 'else', 'one', 'should', 'know', 'how', 'awesome', 'DVD/BD', 'really', 'now.Overall', 'score', '*****5/5', 'StarsThis', 'be', 'best', 'Superstar', 'focused', 'set', 'eitherWWE', 'Bret', 'Hitman', 'Hart', 'Best', 'Best', 'Was', 'Best', 'Ever', 'Will', 'BeorRic', 'Flair', 'Four', 'Horsemen', 'When', 'pick', 'dvd/bd', 'up', ""'re"", 'getting', 'great', 'documentary', 'awesome', 'match', 'listing', 'featuring', 'classic', 'matches', 'video', 'available', 'hype', 'must', 'own', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'wrestling', 'fans', 'DVD', 'will', 'even', 'entertain', 'who', ""'re"", 'not', 'wrestling']",N/A

I was really starting to second guess my career path of being a wrestler and then I watched this. CM Punk inspired me all over again. This is the greatest DVD that WWE has ever put out. And it even helps knowing that CM Punk was an Executive Producer of his DVD, really picking and choosing what goes on the DVD and what doesn't. I've watched it twice, Amazon delivered it to me on the day of its release and this is my first ever Blu-Ray purchase. I got a Blu-Ray player on that day this was released, I'll never forget. It was the greatest day. I highly recommend this DVD, if at all possible, grab the Blu-Ray edition for extra goods.

1554127,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,B008IG0E7M,D.P.,"[17, 21]","I'll be like Punk himself & be blunt honest in that this day & age, WWE hasn't had a good track record of creating & establishing top name main event caliber talent (another subject for another time) but in over the past year, there has been one name who broke through the ""glass ceiling"" to become currently one of the longest reigning WWE Champions in history & the one guy who actually brought back old fans to the promotion they left once the ""Attitude Era"" was over for doing one thing...just speaking his mind & being his ""straight edged"" himself. That man is C.M. Punk & this is his story which he was personally was hands on with in regards to how it would be presented (or as he's called it in interviews, his eulogy) from his childhood to paying his dues, earning his reputation in the independent scene, and fighting for the proper respect in the WWE. This documentary is different than most of the previous WWE sets in that not only was footage used that WWE owns but also footage from an active promotion (some can even say their competition) in Ring Of Honor to the point where Punk was interviewed in their training dojo. Throughout the presentation, you'll hear from Punk himself along with others including his best friend Chez & ""their"" family, Lita, Lars Frederickson from the band Rancid, ring announcer Justin Roberts, his trainer Ace Steel, Colt Cabana, Chris Hero (currently Kassius Ohno), Daniel Bryan, Joey Mercury, Curt Hawkins, Kofi Kingson, Paul Heyman, The Miz, Michael Hayes, John Cena, referee Scott Armstong, Jim Ross, Triple H, and Zack Ryder.  It should also be noted that all the matches are shown in full including exclusive footage of what happened during the commercial breaks along with showing the pre-match interview & video packages building up to the match.The documentary begins talking about him growing up in Chicago with him having a bad relationship with his parents to the point where he called himself a ""Spaceboy"" & how through his experiences with his family came the decision to not drink along with where the mindset of being ""straight edge"" came from. How he discovered wrestling was discussed with the one Hall Of Famer that he felt he connected to when he first started watching leading to him getting involved in backyard wrestling which caused another rift in his family along with how he was so dedicated to wrestling that one person said that ""he makes a better best friend than a boyfriend"" because of how he always put it first. Meeting Colt Cabana was heavily talked about next in terms of how their friendship developed to the point where they toured their match on the independent scene & landed them into their first home promotion of IWA while also going into how Punk developed his heel persona through his real life values & talked about the importance of a T.L.C. match he had with Chris Hero that kept damaging the building created such a huge buzz over the underground scene. Punk discussed his Ring Of Honor career (while actually filming at the ROH training dojo) in regards to how his feud with Raven was the first feud to include a storyline with Raven teaching him followed by talking about the trilogy of matches he had with Samoa Joe before going into the details of the ""Summer Of Punk"" storyline where he used the internet to his advantage & his final match where he openly admits that he wasn't ready for how emotional it would be. Punk's current workout route was discussed in regards to his changes over the years going into his days of at the WWE developmental territory of OVW from the bad attitude he had, the positive & negatives of his relationship with & support from Paul Heyman, and how he really became a student of the game both in & out of the ring. ECW's rebirth was covered next as Punk was Heyman's first draft pick & got the buzz that wasn't expected along with various things going against him like his past on the independents before talking about his series against John Morrison & why Punk didn't like the matches until the final one. His first World Title reign was discussed next with all the problems that happened in regards to not being the ""top guy"" despite being the champion to the point of how & when he found out he was losing the title followed by briefly talking about his title runs with Kofi & the significance of his feud with William Regal. One of the highlights of the documentary came here when talking about his heel turn starting a challenge from Vince himself to where he started lead to him starting to take control of his own career & reverting to his day pre-WWE days to the point where he gained the respect of one of the top guys that never thought he would respect Punk. Punk goes over the importance of his tattoos & how it links him to important people in his life before talking about the Straight Edge Society where Joey Mercury gave a real personal story about how Punk saved him in real life while Punk gives the details of being of ""Wrestling Jesus"" down to little things like the names of the group members & the heavy amount of real life heat he got before going into the frustrations of how it was ended. The various music that Punk listens to is briefly discussed before going into the details of the infamous ""pipe bomb"" he dropped on the world (which was shown in full) from the months leading up to his contract expiring including being very upset at the WrestleMania main event to the backstage reactions from everyone before concluding on his hero's welcome at Money In The Bank, how's he's changed into a leader with one talent saying on how Punk saved his career, and people voicing their opinions on them with even Cena himself saying, ""he's one the most dedicated wrestlers on this planet.""Matches Include:OVW Championship Tournament Finals vs. Brent Albright - Punk gained control early on working over Brent's head with various kicks & forearms along with a frankensteiner & crossface before Brent was able to catch Punk at one point on the outside throwing him into the railing before working over Punk with various suplexes before he was caught with Punk capitalizing himself.  Both men continued to trade momentum as they were able to keep escaping each others offense until a freak accident halted everything with Brett showing his true hatred for Punk & taking advantage of the situation while Punk refused to quit despite being on one leg.  This was a very good encounter with good wrestling from start to finish while getting more aggressive as time went on.""Ohio Valley Wrestling"" Mar. 06vs. Justin Credible - This was Punk's WWE in-ring debut in front of the very ""smart"" crowd of the Hammerstein Ballroom where the crowd was heavy towards with his their response & even some signs in the crowd as Punk's unique in-ring style was showcased early on he locked in a version of an Anaconda Vice while crucifying Credible in the ropes while also showcasing his various kicks & aerial ability like the springboard clothesline while Credible was able to give him some nice competition by working over his back with various holds like a half crab.  This debut was meant to give an impression & for those who hadn't seen him before this, it did.""ECW On Sci-Fi"" Aug. 06vs. ECW Champion John Morrison - After these two had various matches on TV & the previous 3 PPV's (Night Of Champions, Great American Bash, SummerSlam), this was C.M. Punk's last chance to face Morrison for the ECW Championship. Both men traded offensive moves of grounding their opposition along with stiff kicks while breaking out other maneuvers like Punk doing a springboard crossbody from the apron to the floor while Morrison was able to reverse a top rope attempt by Punk into a powerslam at one point & used ""Starship Pain"" for the first time in his career. This was a very competitive match & the best encounter from their series of matches throughout the summer.""ECW On Sci-Fi"" Sep. 07[John Morrison: Rock Star]Money In The Bank Ladder Match vs. Chris Jericho vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. John Morrison vs. Carlito vs. M.V.P. vs. Mr. Kennedy....Kennedy (sorry, I'm a mark for that) - Anyways, you know that this match is set to be nothing more than a non-stop spotfest and boy was it ever. Morrison's moonsault off the top rope with ladder in hand & later taking a fall that every man watching felt, Shelton Benjamin's ""tower of doom"" powerbomb off the ladder & his fall out of the ring onto the ladder wedged on the outside, the Walls Of Jericho on the ladder, Carlito's ""backstabber"" off the ladder, and the return of Matt Hardy. One of the best Money In The Bank's matches yet.WrestleMania XXIV[Blu-Ray Version Of The True Story Of WrestleMania]w/Kofi Kingston vs. World Tag Team Champions Cody Rhodes & Ted DiBiase - Punk & Kofi dominated early before Dibiase & Rhodes had to resort to cheating behind the referee's back to get the advantage where they continued to single out Kofi building up to the hot tag to Punk. This was your basic solid tag team match.""RAW"" Oct. 08No Disqualification Match vs. WWE Intercontinental Champion William Regal - This stipulation was added here after each man got disqualified in their matches for the past two weeks while Punk had the heavy hometown advantage here as they were in his hometown of Chicago. Punk started off with stiff kicks to Regal before he worked over Regal's arm with an armbar & modified version of the Anaconda Vice using the ringropes taking advantage of the No DQ stipulation. Regal's valet, Layla, did get involved while Regal at one point delivered a suplex that landed Punk right on his head with Punk returning the favor delivering a stiff kick right to Regal's head. This was a competitive match with a crowd that was hot from start to finish ending with Punk not only winning the Intercontinental Championship but also becoming a triple crown champion winning all the titles available on RAW in under a year.""RAW"" Jan. '09[Best Of RAW 2009]T.L.C. Match vs. World Champion Jeff Hardy - This match was very similar to how Edge & Jeff Hardy had their ladder match months earlier in that this wasn't a non-stop spotfest more than a match where they used the weapons to make moves more high impact & trying to tell a story. It's a TLC match so all elements were used as expected along with various moments such as Punk slamming Hardy onto an open chair to the backrest hit his spine, Hardy missing a splash & crashing through a table on the outside, Hardy reversing Punk's running knee kick/bulldog combination into a toss to the outside table, and of course Jeff Hardy being the human highlight reel with the swanton bomb that you have to see to believe...and I still didn't believe I saw it when I was there. This was a great one on one TLC match from both men while what happened to end the show was probably just as shocking as we saw another WWE return & great way to end the show.SummerSlam '09[Blu-Ray Version Of Greatest Wrestling Stars Of The 21st Century; Best PPV Matches 2009-2010]vs. Rey Mysterio - At WrestleMania, Mysterio won the match where he would have to join the S.E.S. if he won while Punk won the rematch where his hair was on the line...so this is the final encounter with both stipulations from the previous matches applying here while the S.E.S. were banned from ringside. The match started off quick before Mysterio did a head scissors that drove Punk into the ringside barrier that caused him to start bleeding before he retailed in the ring by tossing Rey out of the ring under the bottom ropes that caused him to hit the barber chair, set up at ringside, headfirst which knocked him silly for a bit while Punk got attended to. The match was stopped before Punk came aggressive at Mysterio after being patched up and focusing on Rey's head with various kids before Mysterio rebounded with a quick win resulting in Punk being forced to get his head shaved...with a little help from ""The Big Red Machine"" & some funny chants from the fans who wished for Rey to shave another part of Punk's body.As a side note, if you don't enjoy the bickering between Lawler & Striker then I suggest you watch this match on mute since they kept going at each other throughout the match.Over The Limit '10[Rey Mysterio: Life Of A Masked Man]vs. WWE Champion John Cena - As everyone already knows, the big story here is that Punk made it clear that his contract expires that night & he planned on walking out of the company with the WWE Championship with Vince McMahon making it clear that he didn't want that to happen (think Survivor Series '97) & that John Cena would be fired if that took place. This is the first time I can remember John Cena being in such a hostile territory with the audience since ECW One Night Stand around 5 years earlier as the crowd was completely pro-C.M. Punk to the point where they were cheering for him before he ever came out while Cena didn't do his usual ""play to the crowd/salute"" entrance as he was all business by walking straight to the ring & holding up the championship while it should be noted that ex-NWA Champion & Punk's good friend Colt Cabana (who was in WWE for a short time as Scotty Goldman & the man Punk's been mentioning on TV in the past few weeks) was in the front row. Cena was greeted with ""You Can't Wrestle"" chants from the start & responded to it by actually doing wrestling such as reversing Punk's attempted at the Anaconda Vice into an armbar while coming to a stalemate with Punk at both escape attempts at an Attitude Adjustment & G.T.S. The chants from the crowd started to split & duel against each other which caused Booker T to reference ""Rocky 4"" of all things with when even Colt at ringside getting some small chants. Punk focused on Cena's neck reversing the A.A. into a DDT while later delivering a top rope kneedrop onto Cena's neck on the apron. There was a point where Punk attempted a crossbody block but mistimed it as Cena ended up hurting his knee while Punk's midsection as effected which Cena tried to capitalize on with an abdominal stretch. Both men went on to find unique counters to each others signature moves including a great series of counters that saw a flying crossbody, A.A., G.T.S., STF, and modified Anaconda Vice. While this was definitely one of Punk's best matches in WWE, the shock here was the fact that he pulled something out of John Cena that I honestly can't remember seeing out of him in a very long time...if EVER as the match went close to half an hour & Cena didn't ""phone it in"" like he's done for the last few PPV's. Definitely a highlight in WWE's history along with the careers of BOTH men involved here.Money In The Bank '11[Best PPV Matches Of 2011]WWE Championship Match vs. Chris Jericho - The battle to see who's really ""The Best In The World"" got a special twist before the match as Johnny Ace added the stipulation that Punk would lose the championship if he got disqualified. Jericho kept trying to have Punk lose his temper earlier by taunting him about his family but staying close to the ropes to Punk would have to break by the count of five or lose the match & even pushed Punk so far by daring him to hit him with a chair. After seeing that those tactics weren't working, Jericho tried to out-wrestle Punk & work over his back after doing a suplex that had Punk land on it hard while Punk would later be pulled off the top rope with his head bouncing off the mat. The match got very competitive as it went on with each guy having various reversals & counters to their signature moves along with some hard hits like Jericho's head being sandwiched between Punk's high knee & the ringpost while Punk was also caught in midair by the Codebreaker. The DQ stipulation hurt the match more than it helped (remember WrestleMania 25?) because they kept overplaying it but once they decided to forget about it & just wrestle then we got the quality expected from two of the ""best in the world.""WrestleMania XXVIIIWWE Championship Match vs. Daniel Bryan - As Punk alluded to in the pre-match interview, the two former Ring Of Honor competitors meet here for the WWE Championship which would have been unthinkable years ago. The crowd was split from the very start as Punk focused on Bryan's leg wrapping it in the ropes before working it over with various stomps & kicks & kneedrops & a curb stomp with his legs wrapped up along with submissions like an indian deathlock & spinning toehold while later tossing him over the top rope to the floor landing knee first. Bryan showed the effects of Punk's offense after delivering a missile dropkick but hurt his own leg in the process as he focused on the midsection that Kane had hurt with a steel chair on the previous SmackDown doing such thing as dropping him on the guardrail, various stretches, a running kneedrop, and the flying headbutt before both men crash & burned on each other with dual crossbody attempts. Both men continued to target each others focal points of the body from here with Bryan's kicks to Punk's ribs, Punk's dragonscrew legwhip & figure four before dropping his Savage elbow but hurting his own ribs in the process, and Bryan being able to counter Punk's trademark bulldog into the Yes Lock. This was a hell of a match that stole the show as the two men who are more known for being wrestlers than entertainers gave you exactly what you would expect from them.Over The Limit '12(Blu-Ray) vs. Rey Mysterio - Over a year before they would have their more famous feud, this met here for the first time in the finals of a #1 Contenders Tournament for the Intercontinental Championship with champion William Regal sitting at ringside as Punk came into this match after losing his tag team title the night before while Mysterio wasn't 100% with a hurt wrist. Punk worked over Mysterio's arm before the momentum picked up with both men exchanging armdrags followed by Mysterio executing a moonsault that had his knees hit Punk's head. Mysterio worked on Punk's arm himself with a head scissors into an armbar while Punk continued working on Mysterio's arm twisting his wrist in an armbar into the crossface before Mysterio was able to catch Punk with a senton & springboard crossbody. Both men had a series of counters such as the 619 into the GTS back into the 619 resulting in a match that was so competitive that Mysterio ended up bleeding from the nose at the end.Armageddon 08DVD extras include bonus stories such as his problems when it came to high school sports, where did the ""C.M."" come from, the detailed story of his worst injury & the recovery from it, the design of his OVW feud with Brett Albright, how his career came full circle from his WrestleMania 22 cameo, the original plan for the December To Dismember PPV, various stars telling their stories of first meeting Punk, the orgins of his unique in-ring style, where ""It's Clobbering Time"" came from, his Cubs hat, the issues he had when traded to RAW in 2009, the conversation Lars had with Punk when it contract was coming up, how the WWE Title ended up in his refrigerator, the rib he played on his ex-girlfriend at Extreme Rules, a music video, and two hidden extras of Punk talking about the significance of a prop from the movie ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" & Kofi Kingston talking about what he did one time for Valentine's Day. Blu-Ray extras include more bonus stories such as his hidden talent with a saxophone, his ECW arena match, and a story on Eddie Guerrero.I will go as far as to say that this was one of the WWE's best presentations ever because it didn't shy away or ""softball"" the history of event that would make WWE look bad, spending a significant amount of time on his career before WWE including the special bonus of getting the footage from the other promotions such as ROH & IWA, and hearing from people that we normally wouldn't don't really hear from in these presentations such as Heyman & Cabana & Hero. Punk himself said that watching this presentation was like watching his own ""eulogy"" because of how it truthly & completely told his story which I can't disagree with while I also liked the fact that all the matches on here served a purpose & told an important part of his career. The only thing I didn't like was that they didn't really go into his various feuds he's had in his WWE career (vs. Rey Mysterio which was some of his best mic work) but in the end, this is a set worth going out of your way to get that I heavily recommend.Side Note: The F.Y.E. version of this set comes with C.M.

Did not like the fact that they did  not talk about how he took over the Nexus and failed.

All must known facts are placed in this box set telling from where he started all the way to where he his now. Told by him, rivals, and enemies too. Really great matches added to see for your entertainment. I would give this around a 4.5 to 4.75 because they could really have waited a little while longer just to add Punk VS Cena at the 2012 Night of Champions. A true match to remember, but it's still something to really get. Enjoy!

1554134,A3N0LBOUQAD1BG,B008IG0E7M,"Jonnathan Ritland ""Hank Peters, Italian Grocer""","[0, 0]","For years he has fought for respect from an early age, to his backyard days, his independent runs through various territories and finally in 2006 WWE fans found out what most wrestling fans around the country and the world had already known. CM Punk is something special and this is his life story told by the man himself, along with comments from friends Colt Cabana, Ace Steel, Chris Hero, Lita, WWE Announcer Justin Roberts, family members, various superstars and talents like Paul Heyman, Daniel Bryan, Joey Mercury, Curt Hawkins, Kofi Kingston and others.It starts out with a short narrative from Punk saying he wasn't supposed to make it in the WWE but he did and he wants to show future stars that it can be done. The parts where he talks about growing up, moving into his best friend's house at an early age, dealing with his alcoholic father and what drove him to be straight edge were moving as was the part about being part of a small wrestling company where his brother swindled thousands of dollars from the promotion and to this day Punk and him haven't talked.Once they get to his runs in IWA and ROH it gets good since they include footage from both promotions and talk about his matches against Samoa Joe, Raven and others. The ECW portion is decent as the bio really picks up as through the runs he had in WWE he had frustrations and that he kept battling through and the best part was him being honest about how he felt he should've been in Miz's place in the Wrestlemania 27 main event against John Cena. The bio closes out with his Money In The Bank 2011 WWE Title Match against Cena and how his re-signing with WWE will lead to bigger things.Bonus Interviews and Featres on Disc 1: 35 minutes worth.-High School Sports: He talks about changing his hair styles and colors, then how his attempts to do high school wrestling and football didn't happen cause they didn't like his hair style.-CM Punk-The Name: We hear about the different versions of the name and what it stands for.-Skull Fracture: The worst injury he ever suffered was during a botched neckbreaker from the second rope at a show in June of '02.

Then to the infamous ECW PPV where Heyman's vision of the main event didn't work out and how Punk talked to Vince after the show.-1st Impressions: Some superstars and friends talk about their first times meeting Punk and how he's not always the nicest guy when he first meets someone.-In-Ring Style: Jim Ross and others talk about his style and move set and how its different from other superstars.-It's Clobbering Time: The meaning behind his entrance and why he says the phrase cause he's such a comic book and music fan.-The Hat: He talks about his Chicago Cubs hat which means a lot to him as it reminds him of home.-""The Most Insulting Thing You Could Say To Me"": After being drafted to Raw, Punk was upset that he was forced into a bad spot and that someone pissed him off by telling him he was ""Cena's TV program going into Wrestlemania"".-A Coversation With Lars: We hear from Lars from the band Rancid who tells a story about when Punk was unsure about whether he would resign with WWE and the advice he gave to help guide Punk.-Title In The Fridge: Right after winning the title at Money In The Bank '11, Punk talks about how he literally ran from the arena and threw the title in the fridge and chugged water for a bit.-Natalie's T-Shirt: We see Punk talking about a shirt he wore on TV that was hers, funny stuff.-""Teenage Anarchist"": A music video of Punk moments by Against Me!Matches on Disc 1-3/1/06, OVW, Tournament Finals for the OVW World Heavyweight Championship, vs. Brent Albright: A rare one from WWE's developmental league as these two rivals faced off in this good technical match. Both displayed good mat and aerial moves, Punk worked on the neck and head to set up for the Anaconda Vice while Brent did some good strength moves and held his own on the mat. Nice spot where Albright catches Punk from the ring apron and slams him head first into the guardrail, later Punk slips off the top rope and seems to hurt his knee so some officials come to check on him. Back from commercial break Punk is taken out on a stretcher, Albright attacks him whipping him with a leather strap. Punk gets in the ring and he and Brent fight some more, the ref is knocked down, Punk gets the strap and whips Albright, but he clips the knee, slaps on the STF, Punk passes out and Brent is the champion. 7/10.-8/1/06, ECW, vs. Justin Credible: Its Punk's ECW debut and we get a prematch promo and the match itself is not much beyond Punk hitting his usual spots, some nice submission and mat work, Credible gets a few moves in but Punk ends up locking on the Anaconda Vice and Justin taps out so Punk wins. 5/10, nice how Punk seemed emotional after his win.-9/4/07, ECW, Last Chance Match for the ECW Championship, vs. John Morrison (Champion): After having 3 PPV matches before where Punk was unable to win, we have this final chance for Punk to get the belt and we get some hype packages that show how we got to this contest. Its a good match though I'm not sure it's one of the best of his career like Punk said in his bio, but thats neither here nor there. Both guys display some good mat wrestling, Morrison does quite well grounding Punk working on the neck and Punk kept going for win with some good moves of his own like a springboard dive to the outside. There's close nearfalls towards the end and Punk gets up hitting the GTS and covers to win the title. 7/10.-3/30/08, Wrestlemania 24, Money In The Bank Ladder Match, vs. Chris Jericho vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. John Morrison vs. Carlito vs. MVP vs. Mr. Kennedy: This was supposed to include Jeff Hardy but he stupidly got suspended for drug use so he was out (nice job since it appeared he was slotted to win this). Anyways as for the match itself it had the usual high spots including Morrison hitting a moonsault to the outside while holding a ladder. Every guy got their spots in and Shelton took a nasty bump off one ladder through another ladder set up on the outside. Matt Hardy does make a shocking appearance preventing MVP (who injured him months back) from winning. CM Punk pulls Jericho's legs into the rungs of the ladder and climbs to retrieve the briefcase. 9/10.-10/27/08, Raw, World Tag Team Championship Match, w/Kofi Kingston vs. Cody Rhodes & Ted DiBiase (Champions) w/Manu: This was mainly about the high flying team of Kofi and Punk getting revenge on members of Priceless for attacks by both of them in recent weeks. Its a good tag team match, Priceless cuts off the ring working over both guys at various times and Punk and Kofi hit some good high spots and keep the pace quick where Punk hits a dive to the outside to the crowd's delight. Rhodes and DiBiase work on the arm of Punk and ground Kingston, Punk gets the tag and soon after hits the GTS on DiBiase and covers to win. 7/10.-1/19/09, Raw, No DQ Match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship, vs. William Regal (Champion): Regal had snuck out victories in the past 2 weeks to hold onto his I.C. title, thus making this stipulation no DQ and the added element of Raw being in Punk's hometown of Chicago helped give it a bigger feel than usual as they cheered big for Punk. Its hard hitting and pretty stiff as both of their unique styles mix very well, both use submission moves well, Punk works on Regal's arm while William targets the neck and head. Punk ends up hitting the GTS and covers to win the I.C. title. 7/10.(Available on Best of Raw 2009)Disc 2-8/23/09, Summerslam, TLC Match for the World Heavyweight Championship, vs. Jeff Hardy (Champion): This rivalry all started after Punk cashed in the MITB briefcase at Extreme Rules to win the title from Jeff, then after Hardy won it back at Night of Champions we have this rematch which is Jeff's specialty match. Its not as spotty as previous TLC bouts but that doesn't make it any less impressive as both guys really use the weaponary to their advantage, both take some falls with Jeff hitting a massive Swanton off a ladder through Punk and the announce table. Later Punk ends up kicking Jeff off the ladder and grabs the belt to win. 9/10. As Punk celebrates The Undertaker's gong hits, the lights go out and he appears underneath Punk and chokeslams him.-5/23/10, Over The Limit, If Rey Loses He Must Join The Straight Edge Society, If Punk Loses He'll Have His Head Shaved, vs. Rey Mysterio: These two had a good rivalry leading up to this match, Rey hits a head scissors launching Punk into the barricade which busted him open, Punk comes back throwing Rey under the bottom rope into the barber's chair at ring side. The referee and a doctor tries working on Punk's cut, which all through it Punk looks pretty upset about the delay. Punk comes out attacking Rey, slamming him into the barricade and just beating on Mysterio, which did get the crowd back into the match. After some great counter wrestling, Rey uses a crucifix pin to pick up the win. 9/10. Afterwards a mystery member of the S.E.S. and Luke Gallows and Serena make their appearance. Then Kane come down and destroys Gallows, the mystery man and Punk. Rey handcuffs Punk to the ring ropes and nails a 619, cuffs his other hand then uses the razor on Punk's head which is kinda graphic.(Available on Rey Mysterio: Life of a Masked Man)-7/17/11, Money In The Bank, WWE Championship Match, vs. John Cena (Champion): Hard to sum up the action in this match as its pure magic and since this was in Punk's hometown of Chicago the crowd erupted and I mean erupted when he came out and oh my was Cena booed when his music hit. This was easily one top 5 matches of the last 15 years in my opinion, the crowds energy was amazing, both guys had the match of their careers, countering moves, switching momentum, tons of near falls and so much more. Punk really got the chance to shine in the main event which was a rarity for him up to this point and yes Cena had a great showing here as well. Near the end Vince McMahon comes down with John Laurenitis and tries to do a screw job ending, Cena punches Laurenitis but then gets the GTS from Punk who makes the cover and wins the title. 11/10. Vince tries to have Del Rio come down and cash in the MITB case but Punk kicks him and leaves through the crowd with the title, just like he said he would.-4/1/12, Wrestlemania 28, WWE Championship Match, If CM Punk gets Disqualified He Will Lose the WWE Title, vs. Chris Jericho: For weeks Chris had run down Punk's family in an effort to get under his skin and the question was could Punk not lose his cool during this contest. There's some good mat wrestling early on and Jericho tried everything to get to Punk even shouting ""How's your father?, How's your sister?"". Punk was about to hit him with a chair, but stopped himself and took it to Jericho, but got a suplex off the apron to the floor.Chris targets the back, with a back breaker and sends him off the second rope to the ring for two, Punk tries coming back and dodges the running bulldog sending Jericho into the turnbuckle. The momentum keeps going back and forth, Jericho locks on the Walls of Jericho which Punk powers out of, hits a kick but only for two. After more big moves Punk goes for a hurricarana off the top but Jericho locks on Walls however Punk gets to the ropes. Nice suicide dive to the outside by Punk, then back in the ring Chris hits the Codebreaker but only for two. Punk tries for the GTS but again the Walls is locked on but Punk counters, then locks on the Anaconda Vice and Chris finally taps out. 9/10.-5/20/12, Over The Limit, WWE Championship Match, vs. Daniel Bryan: For years they fought on the independent circuit and into Ring of Honor and now to one of the main events of a WWE PPV. The crowd cheers both men and the usual ""Yes, Yes, Yes"" chants follow Bryan, along with ""CM Punk chants. It starts with good wrestling by both men as the crowd is split in their chants, both use good kicks and some submission moves as Punk works over the left knee of Bryan. However soon Daniel locks on a shoulder stretch working on the arm and midsection of Punk, then a surfboard but Punk comes back with hammer fists.Punk makes a comeback but Bryan thwarts it and hits a nice flying headbutt then locks on a modified camel clutch, Punk starts battling back and the crowd is once again split on the chants. Both guys keep going all out, Punk locks on a figure four but Bryan gets to the ropes, Daniel keeps up the attack and neither man will stay down. The crowd starts a ""This is Awesome"" chant, after a big diving elbow by Punk there's a ""Randy Savage"" chant. Bryan catches Punk off the running bulldog and locks on the Yes Lock, but Punk rolls him onto his shoulders for three just as Punk was tapping out, but Punk retains the title. 10/10.Blu-Ray Exclusive Features-61 minutes in interviews and backstage footage-No Plan B: Punk talks about handing out flyers during his backyard wrestling days, he also says his only option in life was being a pro wrestler.-Saxophone: Shockingly (well not really) Punk was a rebel while in the school band, also talks about how his aunt helped influenced his taste in music.-Easter Greeting: His ex Natalie talks about a time where he came home with her for Easter and how he greeted her mom about the holiday and it stuck with her family to this day.-Chicken Wings & Apple Pie: Colt Cabana tells a story about when they were starting out in wrestling how Punk ate a ton of chicken wings at a restaraunt cause he thought they were full of protein (which got a laugh from Colt).-Most Recognizable Tattoo: Punk says his Pepsi ink represents his choice of being Straight Edge.-Fish Tattoo: Natalie talks about buying some Vegan food and that after a cooking disaster Punk at her Vegan fish so she wasn't upset about it.

Its definitely one thats better watched and enjoyed, Punk does end up hitting the GTS (breaking Rey's nose in the process) and covers to win. 9/10. Side note: Layla was very distracting when she was shown as I completely forgot how gorgeous she is.What makes this bio great is the brutal and I mean brutal honesty of Punk on a variety of topics, his heavy involvment in the whole project along with footage from other promotions really lended a cool feel to this whole production. After watching this I can understand why some people don't like Punk as a person, but I do, I have major respect for him because he stands up for what he believes in, he's different and refreshing and he's real and that's all any wrestling fan can ask for instead of being fed the same old garbage from other guys.The match selection is quite good also, yes there are a few on other DVD's but each one seemed to focus on a key point in Punk's career. The special interview segments are also quite good and worth shelling out the extra bucks for the blu-ray edition.",5,Best in the Blu-Ray World,1352073600,"11 5, 2012",2012,18624,"['years', 'fought',

1554137,A1DIFL0333QPEB,B008IG0E7M,Marcus T. Brody,"[1, 2]","I remember about a year ago, CM Punk tweeting about wanting to make a DVD that is going to be totally different than anything the WWE has ever produced.  He claimed that it was going to be made the way that HE wanted it to be made.  His own music selection, his own style.  Well, fast forward a year later, and here it is: Best in The World.This DVD takes you on a journey from his youth, all the way to the present.  The documentary sheds some insight as to why Punk is the person he is today; having to overcome a great deal of adversity from his poor family life, alcoholic father, not fitting in at school, etc.  It's incredible, the transformation he's made over the years, and the man he has grown into.John Cena, Kofi Kingston, The Miz, Colt Cabana, Michael Hayes, Triple H, and Curt Hawkins provide most of the guest commentary, but Jim Ross, Lita, and a few others make short appearances as well.  No Vince McMahon, unfortunately.  Would have loved to hear what he had to say.All in all, great documentary.  Very well done.  It was about 11 minutes shy of 2 hours (the documentary part).  I honestly could have easily watched it if it were 4 hours long.  The matches part are cool, but a lot of them you can find on YouTube anyway.  I just look at those like an added throw-in.  The documentary is the cool part, and it doesn't disappoint!",5,Excellent documentary; very well put together.,1349654400,"10 8, 2012",2012,1348,"['remember', 'year', 'ago', 'CM', 'Punk', 'tweeting', 'about', 'wanting', 'make', 'DVD', 'going', 'be', 'totally', 'different', 'anything', 'WWE', 'ever', 'produced', 'claimed', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'made', 'way', 'HE', 'wanted', 'be', 'made', 'own', 'music', 'selection', 'own', 'style', 'Well', 'fast', 'forward', 'year', 'later', 'here', 'Best', 'World.This', 'DVD', 'journey', 'youth', 'way', 'present', 'documentary', 'sheds', 'insight', 'why', 'Punk', 'person', 'today', 'having', 'overcome', 'great', 'deal', 'adversity', 'poor', 'family', 'life', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'not', 'fitting', 'school', 'etc', 'incredible', 'transformation', 'made', 'years', 'man', 'grown', 'into.John', 'Cena', 'Kofi', 'Kingston', 'Miz', 'Colt', 'Cabana', 'Michael', 'Hayes', 'Triple', 'H', 'Curt', 'Hawkins', 'provide', 'most', 'guest', 'commentary', 'Jim', 'Ross', 'Lita', 'few', 'others', 'make', 'short', 'appearances', 'as', 'well', 'Vince', 'McMahon', 'unfortunately', 'Would', 'have', 'loved', 'hear', 'what', 'had', 'say.All', 'great', 'documentary', 'Very', 'well', 'done', 'was', '11', 'minutes', 'shy', '2', 'hours', 'documentary', 'part', 'honestly', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'watched', 'were', '4', 'hours', 'long', 'matches', 'part', 'are', 'cool', 'lot', 'can', 'find', 'YouTube', 'anyway', 'just', 'look', 'added', 'throw-in', 'documentary', 'cool', 'part', ""n't"", 'disappoint']",N/A
1554138,A3DFJWEIUXT6RN,B008IG0E7M,Matt,"[2, 4]","I had high expectations for this set when it was announced last year. When I learned that CM Punk would have a great deal of creative input in the project, my expectations sky-rocketed. Now that ""CM Punk: Best in the World"" has arrived on our shelves, I can honestly say that my expecations have been met and far exceeded. In fact, this is one of the top 5 releases that WWE has ever put out.The nearly two hour documentary begins with a quote from CM Punk with no backround music, which I feel sets the tone for the feature extremely well. Punk openly discusses his rough childhood and his father's alcoholism, which inspired Punk to become straight edge. Punk's adoptive family, childhood friends, and even an ex-girlfriend provide great insight and perspective to CM Punk as a young man.Punk's early days as a backyard wrestler are discussed next. I was not aware of this phase of Punk's career, so it was a blast seeing all the old footage that WWE was able to get their hands on. We move on to Punk's days on the independent wrestling circut. His friendship with Colt Cabana, their chemistry, and their matches in IWA are discussed, as his TLC match with Chris Hero that many feel started the ball rolling for Punk. Cabana and Hero are both interviewed here, as is Punk's trainer, Ace Steel, and it's great to hear from people who were in ther ring with Punk in his early days. His time in Ring of Honor is discussed next. His early feud with Raven and his matches with Samoa Joe are highlighted before the initial ""Summer of Punk"" is talked about. We learned how Punk wanted to mess with the ""smart fans"" who found out about Punk signing with WWE and figured he'd be leaving the company. Instead, Punk won the ROH Heavyweight title and proceeded to sign his WWE contract on the belt. All told, Punk's indy career is given about 30 minutes, which is great to see in a WWE produced dvd.Punk's days in OVW and ECW are discussed next. Paul Heyman, John Cena, Michael Hayes, and Triple H are interviewed and without spoiling any of the stories, this portion sheds great light on the backstage politics that took place during Punk's early WWE tenture. You can really get a feel for Punk (and Heyman's) frustrations.Punk's two MITB and World Heavyweight Championship are discussed. Punk talks very candidly about his feelings on his ill-fated first title run and his much better second reign. Punk talks about his fantastic feud with Jeff Hardy before running into the Undertaker and promptly tumbled down the card.Punk talks about the Sraight Edge Society next. The group was Punk's idea and you can clearly tell he had a blast leading the SES. Joey Mercury tells a very personal story about Punk bringing him back to WWE. Unfortunately, WWE didn't know what to do with the SES and Punk was once again directionless.Punk's backstage issues are talked about next, leading up to his infamous ""pipe bomb"" promo. The promo is shown in full (which is awesome) and it's cool to learn about the backstage mood after the promo. Money in the Bank 2011 and Punk resigning with WWE close out the documentary.Overall, this is one of the best documentaries that WWE has ever produced. It's paced well and you get the feeling that everyone interviewed was being 100% genuine with their feelings (which is a feeling I don't always get from WWE dvds). To me, it ranks just behind Edge's ""You Think You Know Me?"" as the best WWE doc.Also included are about 30 minutes of bonus features that discuss things like Punk's in-ring style, December to Dismember, his  OVW feud with Brent Albright and his worst ever injury. All of the bonus features are worth watching and feel like they could have easily been included in the main feautre without issue.Disc two and three contain matches hand-picked by CM Punk himself. While some will no doubt be familiar, there's not a match that feels out of place, as the tell the (WWE story) of Punk's in-ring career.vs. Brent Alright for the vacant OVW Heavyweight Championship (OVW. 03/01/06) A solid match from Punk's time in OVW. Albright (who I am not familiar with) and Punk have great chemistry and put on a hard hitting match. A bizarre injury angle almost ruins the match for me, but the in-ring action is too solid to ignore. 2.5/5vs Justin Credible ( ECW TV. 08/01/06) Basic tv match that was Punk's introduction to WWE. Punk's pre-match promo is shown beforehand. Nothing special in this match. Credible dominates much of the match before Punk hit's his running knee and slaps on the Anaconda Vice for the win. 2/5Last Chance Match for the ECW Championship - vs John Morrison (ECW TV. 9/04/07) Punk said on the dvd that his is one of his best matches. I'm not sure about that but it is a great match. Both men worked fast and agressive and showed off their impressive athleticism. The match goes back and forth before Punk nails a GTS to win the belt. 3.5/5Money in the Bank Match - vs Chris Jericho, Carlito, Shelton Benjamin, John Morrison, MVP & Mr. Kennedy (Wresltemania 24. 03/30/08) Great spot-fest that is non-stop action. Shelton Benjamin is the MVP of the match with his crazy bumping ability. Great climax to the match with Punk and Jericho on top of the ladder. 4/5World Tag Team Championship Match - w/Kofi Kingston vs Ted DiBiase & Cody Rhodes (Raw. 10/27/08) Punk and Kofi are friends in real life so it's no surprise that they have great chemistry as a team (as do DiBiase & Rhodes.) It's a typical tag match, with the faces getting in early offense before the heels dominate the majority of the match. Kofi gets the hot tag to Punk and we have new Tag Team Champions. 2.5/5No DQ Match for the Intercontinental Championship - vs William Regal (Raw. 01/19/09) Taking place from Chicago, Regal and Punk worked a hard hitting match for the IC strap. These two have great chemistry and it would be great to see what they could do with 20+ minutes. Still, a great tv match. 3/5TLC Match for the World Heavyweight Championship - vs Jeff Hardy (Summerslam. 08/23/09) One of my favorite matches ever and arguably the best (one on one) TLC match of all time. Both Hardy and Punk bumped their asses off and combined great storytelling with amazing spots. Just a great match. 5/5Rey Joins the SES vs CM Punk's Hair - vs Rey Mysterio (Over the Limit. 05/23/10) Mysterio and Punk always put on great matches together and this gem is no exception. The match is hurt by Punk getting busted open in the beginning and match being stopped while he was stiched up (it's wrestling, WWE. Blood is ok sometimes). But, once they got going, these two worked a blistering match. The fact that Mysterio wins irks me a little, but the post-match shenanigans are included. 3.5/5WWE Championship Match - vs John Cena (Money in the Bank. 07/17/11) Simply put, one of the best matches ever. The crowd reaction, the in-ring action, the fact that you never knew who was going to win and the of course, the ending, all add up to the perfect package. An all-time, top-ten match. 5/5WWE Championship Match - vs Chris Jericho (Wrestlemania 28. 04/01/12) Two of my favoirte wrestlers of all-time go toe-to-toe at Wrestlemania for the title. The match starts slow but builds to an exciting climax. There was no way a match with Chris Jericho and CM Punk was going to be bad and this match was a wrestling purist's dream 5/5WWE Championship Match - vs Daniel Bryan (Over the Limit. -5/20/12) These two know each other extremely well and used that fact to their advantage to put on a wrestling clinic. If you've watched these two hook up in ROH, you'll appreciate the sublte callbacks to their previous matches. Fantastic match. 5/5Overall verdict: An engrossing documentary, entertaining bounus features, and a no-dud match listing easily make this one of the best dvd sets ever produced by WWE. WWE have been on a roll with their dvd sets latley (Randy Orton's, Steve Austin's, The Rock's, and Edge's dvds all come to mind) and ""CM Punk: Best in the World"" continues the trend. A definite must-buy. 5/5",5,The Best in the World Gets One of the Best Releases from WWE,1350172800,"10 14, 2012",2012,8006,"['had', 'high', 'expectations', 'set', 'when', 'was', 'announced', 'last',

I probably have to say I have watch this DVD at least 4-5 times.  This DVD is just this darn good.  Before WWE brought CM Punk to our TV screens, this DVD goes back to his upbringing and his indy days before making it in the big leagues.  I am glad the WWE has finally allowed CM Punk the chance to shine on TV.  My only minor gripe is the DVD does not include any matches from his indy days.  I guess the WWE didn't want to pay for the rights to feature them but other then that, it feature his big matches such as his first time winning Money in the Bank, his classic with Rey Mysterio, and his Money in the Bank title match with John Cena.  If you want to know more about CM Punk and his background, this is a great DVD.  I think even non-wresting fans can get into him as he comes off as a hard working wrestler who earned his right to be on top.

1554144,A3E6KZL8HCSX5L,B008IG0E7M,TMH,"[2, 4]","The best WWE DVDs and documentaries are produced with hands on involvement from the talent involved,WWE: Bret ""Hitman"" Hart - The Best There Is, The Best There Was, The Best There Ever Will BeandWWE: Greatest Rivalries - Shawn Michaels vs. Bret Hart [Blu-ray] are perfect examples of this; so when CM Punk announced months ago that he was going to be very hands on with this DVD project, I immediately knew it was going to be something special... and it is! This is easily one of WWE's best documentaries ever put together on an individual wrestler. The documentary tells the story of Punk's wrestling career from it's ambitious backyard wrestling start to his unforgettable WWE title win at Money in the Bank 2011. Punk's input is clearly evident in the presentation, you can see it in the hand written graphics to the licensed video footage from Punk's independent wrestling career. I've gotta say, it's very surreal to see footage from IWA and Ring of Honor on a WWE DVD, and the clips they show will make you want to track down those matches on DVD. Hardcore fans know that arguably CM Punk's greatest matches took place in Ring of Honor against the great Samoa Joe, so it's awesome to see actual video footage from their epic encounters and not just still images courtesy of Pro Wrestling Illustrated in the documentary. No doubt, CM Punk used his influence to convince WWE to license this content for use on this DVD and it's a testament to how far he's traveled up the WWE ladder to be able to make that happen. Thanks to the footage from IWA, Ring of Honor and Ohio Valley Wrestling (WWE's old developmental territory that Paul Heyman ran during Punk's time there) you get to see the evolution of the CM Punk character, and it's a fascinating journey. They didn't bother to discuss Punk's time in TNA, but considering the fact that they're WWE's biggest competitor, the current lawsuit and what happened to Punk in TNA, it's no surprise they didn't mention Punk's time there at all.Punk's passion for professional wrestling is clearly evident as he tells his story. He pulls no punches and holds nothing back, but I wouldn't expect him to tell his story any other way. For example, he pointed out how surprised and disrespected he felt to see Miz headline WrestleMania XXVII against John Cena instead of himself. I was so glad to hear him say that! I never understood why the Miz was shot to that spot instead of Punk, so it was great to see him stand up for himself and express something that I and a lot of other fans were screaming at out television sets about when the Miz was given the title. Punk also doesn't hold back about his thoughts about WWE creative and how he would tear up their scripts right in front of them (I wish more wrestlers would do that, the shows would be a million times better if wrestlers were simply given bullet points and no scripts). Punk also offers insight into several key career moments, like why he wasn't given the ECW title at the December to Dismember PPV (this story is told in the extras).I was glad to see they interviewed Colt Cabana for the documentary. Why he was let go by WWE is beyond me. He's the same size as Punk, athletic and just as good on the mic; so why not use him? Any way, Colt provides some great insight into Punk's early career and what drives him as a performer. Paul Heyman is also interviewed as well are Punk's friends, family and fellow wrestlers from WWE and the independents. The interviews provide various perspectives that help to tell a very thorough and concise story of Punk's life and career thus far.As for match listings and extras, I really loved the bonus interview section. You'll get to hear why WWE went with Bobby Lashley as ECW champion instead of Punk at December to Dismember, the origin of his name, a scary injury and more stories and insights into Punk's life and career. The matches are great and truly contain the highlights of Punk's WWE career. The only one I would've liked to have seen added is at least one match with the Undertaker, otherwise this is a very definitive collection of matches.To summarize, this is an outstanding release by WWE and I for one would love to see more hands on releases like this from them. If you're a CM Punk fan, or a general fan of professional wrestling, I think you'll love seeing this in-depth and passionate profile on CM Punk. I've read some other various reviews and comments coming from fans saying that they were turned off by Punk's arrogance during the documentary, and I couldn't disagree more with them. I didn't think Phil came off as arrogant at all, I think he came off as supremely confident, and folks, you wont get far in this life without that...",5,Punk's Passion,1349827200,"10 10,
