Yes, I will admit, the acting (secondary characters) is a bit shaky at times, but I can handle that better than the sex, violence and language coming out of Hollywood these days. The two main characters do an excellent job, especially Mac. He played the hardened, bitter husband and father without seeming overdone. Watching this movie as a parent and a Christian, I placed myself in his shoes. What would I do if it was my child? Could I forgive? I hope so. The end scene was truly amazing. I cannot say some of what happened in the film wasn't a bit ""saw that coming"", but watching Mac break down emotionally and the love of his friend moved me as I thought about the way God orchestrates our lives, bringing people in for a season. This isn't a film easily forgotten after viewing. As for some of the complaints about this movie, no, it may not be in your face preaching and maybe isn't all you think a Christian movie should be (though I thought it was!) but it's clean and the message is powerful, so ease up.

Instead the power of Jesus was not emphasized in a meaningful way. I read the movie created by a church group like Courageous so I expected a strong Jesus message. Why wasn't Jesus emphasized more during the movie? The plot was sensationalized and predictable like most Hollywood movies BUT Jesus and God were mentioned at some level. Then there was the unbelievable sensationalism. The son's killer comes back to apologize the exact day the pastor sergeant returns to church after having donating his kidney to his police partner's son after being the only donor they could find? This made the movie not believable or realistic. I was expecting his long lost father to show up too at this same moment. It was just over the top. Instead of the son and father having issues the son becomes borderline gang member.

It was very hard to keep up with what was going on and the whole thing seemed disjointed and did not flow smooth at all.  The dialogue wasn't even that great.  It was hard to keep up with who was the main character and who was the supporting cast.  I loved the partners family but they didn't show enough of the love there either.  The main focus was on how big a bigot the main character was and what a general creep he was to everyone.

1438296,A3P876I6K3KL8V,B005335K9A,C. Long,"[3, 4]","This was a movie I was really looking forward to.  Unfortunately, honestly, I have to say, that while there are a few redeeming things, I was disappointed on several levels.  The acting and production quality were both alright (not good, but alright) and did not distract from the story.  The problem came in with the story itself, and even more than that, some of the spiritual content in the story.  Let me explain.I guess I'm starting to get a little weary of Christian movies that are just loaded with obvious stereotypes, cliches, and more than that, surface Christianity.  The obvious racial thing was played pretty much exactly as you knew it would.  The story itself, though taking a few odd turns (i.e. the son going from being honest and open with his dad to what they made him be a few scenes later where his accident occurs, which didn't even make any sense), pretty much played exactly as you knew it would.  By half-way through the movie, even though I wasn't sure of specifics, I pretty much knew exactly where the movie was going to be taking me for the next 45 minutes and honestly wasn't sure I really cared enough to see it.  That's never a good sign when you start thinking such things halfway through a movie.I'll try to explain more in a minute, but I think I can provide a specific example that is representative of my feelings/issues with this movie. In the movie, there's several scenes with a ""Christian counselor"" that the wife (and son) see for help.  They actually had such a person claim she was NOT a ""Christian counselor"" but a counselor that was a Christian - trying to make some point to make you as the viewer think that was such a great thing she said.  But it wasn't.  It was wrong, and it was NOT Biblical.  I don't want someone that is trained in the ways and knowledge of the world, who just happens to also be a Christian as an afterthought, counseling me.  I'd much rather have a ""Christian Counselor"" - somebody who sees their Christianity as an integral part of their counseling.  But, actually, one could easily argue Scripturally that that's the JOB of the pastor or deacons or spiritually mature members in the church, not somebody you go and pay on the ""outside"".And here's my point: This scene alone shows the contrast between movies like this, and say, the movies produced by Sherwood Baptist (Courageous, Fireproof, etc.).  In Courageous, there's family issues and tragedy, and the man goes to his pastor for Godly Spiritual counsel / wisdom.  In this movie, the filmmakers have them go to somebody who just identifies themselves as ""a counselor, who also happens to be a Christian"".  This may seem like a little thing, but this one contrast alone tells you much of what you need to know about this movie because it has a similar feel all the way through the movie, which more ""baby Christians"" might not pick up on, but those that have been actively growing in the faith a while, should be able to spot.There are several other examples that could be given (such as the ""conversion"" scene), but basically the movie just never ""felt quite right"" to me in my spirit.  This movie is more about a general message of love, grace, and forgiveness, than the real depth of those messages found in REALITY in, and because of, Jesus Christ.With that said, despite some of its questionable spiritual content and completely stereotypical portrayals, there are still messages of love, grace, and forgiveness in this movie (both forgiving yourself and forgiving others), and that's certainly not something I'm going to knock.  And because those messages, which we all need to hear, are ones that can affect some people very deeply if there's been lots of unforgiveness or hurt in their life (which describes many people), this can be a meaningfully positive movie.  I have read several such reviews, and have no problem envisioning some people being genuinely touched by this movie in a ""net positive"" way.My favorite thing about this movie: I really liked that the black cop put his love into real, practical action - it went beyond just a sermon (which we get to hear part of earlier in the movie).  And they clearly showed that him doing that also spured on many other people to want to do the same.  So for that reason alone, this movie does have a major redeeming point (even though, because this movie was utterly predictable, I knew pretty much as soon as the accident occurred that this was going to happen.)At the end of the day, my opinion is that if you're looking for a movie that explores the importance of the family unit and reconciliation in the family after loss, then you'd be much better served by a movie like ""Courageous"" that goes much deeper than surface ""Christianny Christianity"".  If you're looking for a movie to teach you a message of love and grace and forgiveness, I'd say there are better options out there also.  But because this movie shares them also, it still might be worthwhile for some.Chris LongLaugh & Lift ministries",3,Disappointed but some may enjoy,1329350400,"02 16, 2012",2012,4994,"['was', 'movie',

I was told by the cashier that the movie sold out fast that everyone wanted the movie.. Well I see why now that I have viewed the movie.We found out about The Grace Card after viewing another christian movie, as The Grace Card was one of the previews, and after seeing the preview I knew that I wanted to view the movie and add the movie to our movie collection.This movie was great family entertainment, clean entertainment. This movie really did Bless my family and I.. For me it was right on time because I am dealing with difficult co workers (which is an understatement) and this movie helped me to see the Grace and Forgiveness that I needed. The main characters helped me to see that the difficult people that I am dealing with are really showing me that it is not about me, But about Grace and Forgiveness. It is about being a light in dark places. God places you in hostile environments so that we can change the atmosphere and win souls.I pray more movies like this one are made, because there is a hunger for this genre, souls are hungry and this is one great way to feed them and to start a grass roots movement in many communities to take those communities back, families back, marriages back, etc.The characters did an awesome job, The producers did an awesome job, everyone involved in this movie all the actors and the individuals that worked behind the scenes with this movie did an awesome job. The quality of the movie was awesome, I knew I had to find this movie and share this movie with my family. Which they loved the movie as well. I will continue to show this movie to family and friends and as many individuals as I can.I like how this movie showed the issues that many families face on a daily basis. Many just don't want to talk about it. I am glad that The Grace Card was created made into a movie.

1438319,A1CTO6QJL5H909,B005335K9A,Hotaru-San,"[71, 89]","Before watching The Grace Card, I heard several very good reviews about it. Everyone who watched it seemed to think it was a very profound and well done movie of faith. Needless to say, I was excited to watch the movie and had high(er) expectations.The Pros:-The cinematography as a whole is not bad. For the most part, the shots were good.-The actor who played Mac (the white male cop, main protagonist) was the best actor in the movie. However, even he had some moments that were ""cringe worthy"".-The anger and frustration over finances in the home were spot on.The Cons:-The acting. ...Enough said.-The dialogue was clunky in several places.-Sometimes, the choices of scenes were more of a distraction than helping the story. In several cases the choice to put in a scene jolted you out of the flow of the story.-Overall, there was a feeling to the film that didn't sit right with me and those watching it with me. It's hard to describe. It's like you wished you had never watched the movie and never, ever want to watch it again. But it's more than that. It leaves a bad feeling with you for awhile. Thankfully, God isn't a God who wants you to be in that state and lifts you out of it!-There were faulty theories and strange comments that were rather disturbing. One scene/line in particular was at the end of the movie when a member of Sam's (the black male cop, main protagonist, pastor) church said to the rest of the congregation -about Sam-, ""Welcome him back, he's our healer, Pastor Sam!"" Whether you are Christian or not, that statement is very creepy. If you are Christian you'll know that the phrase contradicts everything in the Bible.-The movie, which is supposed to be a movie of God's grace and faith in Jesus, fell short in that area. Although it had a moment of repentance and two or three characters were ""Christians"", it really lacked God and having a relationship with Him. It was disappointing to see that the pastor/cop, Sam, became a pastor of a church because he thought it was the thing he was supposed to do and thought it was success to make ""his"" church bigger. He suffers from dissatisfaction in that he can't make things happen in the church. First of all, Sam shouldn't have become a pastor unless God specifically told him to- not because it seemed like the best thing for a good Christian guy, or the right thing to do. Second, he- as many real life pastors today- missed the fact that it's not about a bigger church attendance and it's not a pastor's job to make a mega-church. The job of the pastor is to shepard the people and to show God's heart. You do what God tells you to do and He'll bring the increase.Lastly, Sam never recognized the fact that the source of his dissatisfaction was that he needed a RELATIONSHIP with God and not a distant mutual acquaintance. He never realized that maybe he WASN'T supposed to be a pastor. Sam should have taken a hiatus from ministry until he knew that God wanted him to go back or to quit being a minister.Perhaps the real reason why this movie didn't make the cut is a combination of the bad feeling of the film, the lack of Jesus' saving grace, the odd comments and central theme of human grace and human healing.",2,An Honest Review,1330819200,"03 4, 2012",2012,3199,"['watching', 'Grace', 'Card', 'heard', 'several', 'very', 'good', 'reviews', 'Everyone', 'who', 'watched', 'seemed', 'think', 'was', 'very', 'profound', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'faith', 'Needless', 'say', 'was', 'excited', 'watch', 'movie', 'had', 'high', 'er', 'Pros', '-The', 'cinematography', 'whole', 'not', 'bad', 'most', 'part', 'shots', 'were', 'good.-The', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Mac', 'white', 'male', 'cop', 'main', 'protagonist', 'was', 'best', 'actor', 'movie', 'However', 'even', 'had', 'moments', 'were', 'cringe', 'worthy', '.-The', 'anger', 'frustration', 'finances', 'home', 'were', 'spot', 'on.The', 'Cons', '-The', 'acting', 'Enough', 'said.-The', 'dialogue', 'was', 'clunky', 'several', 'places.-Sometimes', 'choices', 'scenes', 'were', 'more', 'distraction', 'helping', 'story', 'several', 'cases', 'choice', 'put', 'scene', 'jolted', 'flow', 'story.-Overall', 'was', 'feeling', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'sit', 'right', 'watching', 'hard', 'describe', 'wished', 'had', 'never', 'watched', 'movie', 'never', 'ever', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'more', 'bad', 'feeling', 'awhile', 'Thankfully', 'God', ""n't"", 'God', 'who', 'be', 'state', 'lifts', 'were', 'faulty', 'theories', 'strange', 'comments', 'were', 'rather', 'disturbing', 'One', 'scene/line', 'particular', 'was', 'end', 'movie', 'when', 'member', 'Sam', 'black', 'male', 'cop', 'main', 'protagonist', 'pastor', 'church', 'said', 'rest', 'congregation', 'Sam-', 'Welcome', 'back', 'healer', 'Pastor', 'Sam', 'are', 'Christian', 'not', 'statement', 'very', 'creepy', 'are', 'Christian', ""'ll"", 'know', 'phrase', 'everything', 'Bible.-The', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'movie', 'God', 'grace', 'faith', 'Jesus', 'fell', 'short', 'area', 'had', 'moment', 'repentance', 'two', 'three', 'characters', 'were', 'Christians', 'really', 'lacked', 'God', 'having', 'relationship', 'Him', 'was', 'disappointing', 'see', 'pastor/cop', 'Sam', 'became', 'pastor', 'church', 'thought', 'was', 'thing', 'was', 'supposed', 'do', 'thought', 'was', 'success', 'make', 'church', 'bigger', 'dissatisfaction', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'things', 'happen', 'church', 'First', 'Sam', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'become', 'pastor', 'God', 'specifically', 'told', 'to-', 'not', 'seemed', 'best', 'thing', 'good', 'Christian', 'guy', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'Second', 'he-', 'many', 'real', 'life', 'pastors', 'today-', 'missed', 'fact', 'not', 'bigger', 'church', 'attendance', 'not', 'pastor', 'job', 'make', 'mega-church', 'job', 'pastor', 'shepard', 'people', 'show', 'God', 'heart', 'do', 'what', 'God', 'do', ""'ll"", 'bring', 'increase.Lastly', 'Sam', 'never', 'recognized', 'fact', 'source', 'dissatisfaction', 'was', 'needed', 'RELATIONSHIP', 'God', 'not', 'distant', 'mutual', 'acquaintance', 'never', 'realized', 'maybe', 'WAS', ""N'T"", 'supposed', 'be', 'pastor', 'Sam', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'hiatus', 'ministry', 'knew', 'God', 'wanted', 'go', 'back', 'quit', 'being', 'real', 'reason', 'why', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'cut', 'combination', 'bad', 'feeling', 'film', 'lack', 'Jesus', 'saving', 'grace', 'odd', 'comments', 'central', 'theme', 'human', 'grace', 'human', 'healing']",N/A

Well that is because this film must appeal to the non-Christian.  In case you haven't noticed if you use Christ, Christian to much on the no believer they tune you out.  This film does two thing it brings a Christian Kinder garden if you will to someone that will maybe not set still if you mention Christ more than 5 times in an 1.5 hour movie.  It also addresses a race problem which I see all the time among supposed Christians.  I am white and grew up in the 50s and 60s in the south and remember what went on.  It's hard to believe we still need healing there but we do.  So I think this film is just right for just who needs to see it.  If you don't get it maybe it isn't for you but there is a message and it will speak to someone who needs it.  Remember our primary purpose is to carry the message to the non-believer this does that.  If you don't think is has enough Christ good you you probably don't need it but someone does.  I plan on spreading it around to anybody. I enjoyed it.  Yes the acting was not perfect but I've seen very little big money going into this type of film.  If all your worried about is that acting quality then maybe you have a problem and you need to remember the primary purpose or maybe you need to be less critical of the message carrier and more open to the message.

While police officers Mac McDonald and Sam Wright can't imagine why they've suddenly been teamed up together, they soon learn that God has a purpose for everything.Mac's life is in shambles. Having never been able to get over the sudden death of his oldest son nearly 17 years before, Mac's withdrawal and anger is hurting his wife, his other son, and his job. Prejudice of African-Americans (due to the fact that it was a black drug dealer who killed his son) Mac baulks when the police force teams him up with newly-promoted Sergeant Mac McDonald--an African-American, and a preacher to boot. Sam isn't all too crazy about having Mac as a buddy either. Mac doesn't like him just because of the color of his skin, and won't listen to him when out on the streets. What to do?The two main actors who played Mac and Sam were great. There were several actors who seemed a bit dead--as if they were reading the script instead of acting--and that got a bit annoying. The music is contemporary Christian, which I personally didn't mind, but others might.The Grace Card deals with the sensitive racial issue, as well as several other topics. Because of heated arguments and fights and other disturbing scenes, I wouldn't recommend this for younger children. Teens would probably learn a lot through this book, so I highly recommend it to them.All in all, I found The Grace Card a very enjoyable movie. Perfect to watch as a family with the teens.

An emotional roller coaster from the first scene where Mac McDonald (Michael Joiner) and his family are put through the hardest of life's tragedies as his young son is killed by a drug deal gone bad. While the police are pursuing the dealer, Tyler rides directly into the path of the dealer's car.Now the family, 17 years later is still struggling in the various stages of grief. For Mac, it's getting over the hate he still feels for the boy who took the life of his son. Even though he doesn't say he's a racist, his actions confirm that he is being held captive. Now partnered with Sam Wright (Mike Higgenbottom), who's an up and coming pastor and who just received the promotion that Mac had hoped he would get, he is faced with his greatest enemy.Sam Wright is trying to get his church started so he can quit to police force, however he too struggles with his messages when he can't even find a way to reach a hurt and wounded man he is partnered with everyday who hates him simply based on his skin color.Blake is the remaining son who is on the verge of not graduating in his senior year due to his grades. He is still dealing with trying to live up to Tyler even though the accident happened 17 years ago. He turns to the wrong crowd since being at home with his mom and dad only leads to more arguments. His dad, Mac, believes he will never measure up to his expectations.Louis Gossett Jr. plays a small role as the grandfather of Sam who teaches him about what the definition of grace means through a story of a slave owner on a plantation. This movie is well produced and the storyline will impact you no matter where you stand in life.I received the DVD, The Grace Card, compliments of Propeller and Provident Films for my honest review and once again LOVE that movies like this are being made for families again. The message is relevant to anyone who questions what the meaning of grace is and how forgiveness works in any situation we face in life. A word of caution: you WILL need tissues for this one.

It was an incredible movie with great themes and very moving and inspiring messages. My brothers playfully teased my mom and I about our tears after the movie because they had seen us crying during one of several emotional scenes.The Grace Card: ""I promise to pray for you every day, ask your forgiveness, grant you the same, and always be your friend"".Mac is a man who has been drowning in guilt and anger for seventeen years. When his five year old son, Tyler, was killed by a black drug dealer's car, Mac's family fell apart and Mac became a racist police man so that his tragedy would not happen to any one else and he could feel less guilty for destroying his family. His other son, Blake, loves his mom but can't stand the level of perfection his dad expects of him because the standard his father holds him up to is his dead five year old brother. Mac's wife can't get a job because she fell at work and now has a disability. 17 years have gone by since the death of their 5 year old son and their family is falling apart.Sam is Mac's new police partner and a pastor who is working hard to get enough money so that he can become a full time preacher. Since Sam is black and Mac is a racist, their relationship doesn't start as a friendly one.  Sam doesn't understand why God has put Mac into his life, but his wife thinks that God has put Sam into Mac's life.  It turns out their both right as tragedy strikes Mac's family once again and finally brings Mac to his knees before God.  It is through Sam's friendship and sacrifice that Mac sees God's Grace and is able to share it with another who has hurt him deeply.  This story is about Grace, not judgement.  It is about forgiveness, not prejudice.  It is about GodThis is a great movie and I learned a lot from it. It had many great messages about friendship, family, love, racism, murder, stealing and grace. It was very inspiring and perfectly appropriate for all ages.

Most Christian movies I have viewed have been greatly lacking in their acting abilities.The Grace Card is really different. This movie proves great actors and stories can come from the Christian community.Besides the acting, the story itself is a winner. It is a very touching, emotional movie that will bring tears to your eyes.The Grace Card is full of hurting, blame, loss, forgiveness and sacrifice.The main story is when someone does something against you, you will forgive them and love them even if they don't ask-that's The Grace Card.My three youngest children 17, 18 and 20 watched it and approved it. They are hard to please, but have really loved it and will watch it again.The end of this movie is so fantastic and amazing you will be brought to tears.I give this the highest rating possible.

However, I was sadly disappointed in this movie.  It was not well-made, not even comparable to the Sherwood movies (Flywheel, Facing the Giants, Fireproof, Courageous).  The interview in the extras shows the (producer/director?) saying that when he saw Fireproof he thought, ""we can do that too"".  Sorry, but they failed.  The idea of forgiveness in a movie is great.  But this movie spent the first 1-1 1/4 hours setting up/showing how bitter the main character is about the death of his son (all very dark).  Then in the last 25ish minutes, the reversal happens.  This transformation period was my favorite part of the whole movie, tear-provoking & touching (somewhat resembling Sherwood movies)...but the brevity of this portion of the movie really ruins the moment.  It's like they were setting up the movie and then realized how long it was and slapped an end on it.  It would have been much better if they spent just 30-40 minutes setting everything up, more time on the reversal/transformation of hearts, then the end could be 10 minutes of showing the characters walking through life with their new/changed hearts.  I have to honestly say your time would be MUCH better spent watching the Sherwood movies, which are deep & truly life-changing.",3,"Slow, disappointing",1326067200,"01 9, 2012",2012,1382,"['reviews', 'movie', 'looked', 'great', 'message', 'forgiveness', 'something', 'so', 'many', 'bondage', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'However', 'was', 'sadly', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'well-made', 'not', 'even', 'comparable', 'Sherwood', 'movies', 'Flywheel', 'Facing', 'Giants', 'Fireproof', 'Courageous', 'interview', 'extras', 'producer/director', 'saying', 'when', 'saw', 'Fireproof', 'thought', 'can', 'do', 'too', 'Sorry', 'failed', 'idea', 'forgiveness', 'movie', 'great', 'movie', 'spent', 'first', '1-1', '1/4', 'hours', 'setting', 'up/showing', 'how', 'bitter', 'main', 'character', 'death', 'son', 'very', 'dark', 'Then', 'last', '25ish', 'minutes', 'reversal', 'transformation', 'period', 'was', 'favorite', 'part', 'whole', 'movie', 'tear-provoking', 'touching', 'somewhat', 'resembling', 'Sherwood', 'movies', 'brevity', 'portion', 'movie', 'really', 'moment', 'were', 'setting', 'up', 'movie', 'then', 'realized', 'how', 'long', 'was', 'slapped', 'end', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'spent', 'just', '30-40', 'minutes', 'setting', 'everything', 'up', 'more', 'time', 'reversal/transformation', 'hearts', 'then', 'end', 'could', 'be', '10', 'minutes', 'showing', 'characters', 'walking', 'life', 'new/changed', 'hearts', 'have', 'honestly', 'say', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'MUCH', 'better', 'spent', 'watching', 'Sherwood', 'movies', 'are', 'deep', 'truly', 'life-changing']",N/A
