The scenes at the cottage were lacking and left you wondering what happened. It to me was very poor. You knew what was going to be in the end and you felt like you were at a funeral the entire movie.

979728,A29VKODW4R5U7W,B000EXDRUI,dooby,"[47, 49]","I liked this film very much. It's a very intense little drama which will provoke reflection, indignation and much post-viewing discussion, as evidenced by the postings here. What happens when as a fairly successful young woman, you are diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour and given just months to live. What happens when as a happily married man, the first ""true love"" of your life turns up at the door and tells you she's dying and wants to spend her last days with you? What happens when as a happily married woman, your husband's first love turns up and asks to ""borrow"" your husband for the last weeks of her life? How these people respond is the story of the film and it is gripping from first to last.The actions of these characters are far from exemplary but they are believable. These are human beings, not saints. Personally I thought the dying young woman's actions were extremely self-centered, insensitive and selfish. She must have known perfectly well that her actions would wreak havoc on her ""true love's"" marriage. One's imminent death is not a license to ruin other people's lives. The man's response to her proposition is equally disappointing. When your wife makes it crystal clear that she doesn't want you spending time with your ex-lover, irrespective of whether she's dying or not, you do not blissfully ignore her pleas because you coveniently assume you have a ""higher"" obligation to a dying friend. It may be old fashioned to point out, but a man's first loyalty should be to his spouse, not his ""first love."" The wife's reponse was to be expected. My sympathies lay with her from the start. She could and should have tried to be more understanding but how understanding can you be with someone who felt every right to take your spouse away and did not look the least bit sickly to boot. Perhaps if her husband had been more trustworthy she could have exhibited more compassion.The script is good. The acting is equally good. This is an ensemble movie with an excellent all round cast. Gerard Butler's charm and charisma alone saves his character. I vouch that many ladies who defend the husband's actions do so because they see it as defending Gerard Butler. If a lesser actor had taken on the role, they would have been scathing in their condemnations. Valerie Edmund as the dying woman, Sarah, is just as good in winning our affections while at the same time repelling us with her behaviour. Despite my misgivings over her actions, I found her defiant attitude towards impending death heartening, even heroic. I was moved by her final exhortation, ""Don't sleepwalk through life..."" ending with its famous Dylan Thomas quotation, ""Rage, rage against the dying of the light."" Many of the poor ratings for this film come from viewers who are unhappy with the characters' actions. But judging the characters' behaviour and judging the film should be two separate things. I found the characters' conduct less than salutary but I found the film exceptionally good because it was topical, thought-provoking, involving and moving. There are far too few such films being made these days.Curiously, the film was shot in 2.35:1 widescreen - a very wide aspect ratio usually reserved for Hollywood epics and blockbusters, not for an intimate drama like this. Perhaps the director wanted to showcase the beauty of the Borderland (Scottish Borders). With such a widescreen aspect, Hen's Tooth should have provided an anamorphic transfer (widescreen TV enhancement). Instead they have letterboxed this ultra-widescreen into the standard 4:3 frame leaving viewers with a thin sliver of a ribbon of film to watch. Playback on a newer widescreen TV is less than ideal because it has to be manually magnified resulting in loss of image detail. For a relatively recent film (1998), there is an inordinate amount of white specks appearing on the print. Not enough to mar your enjoyment but irritating nonetheless. Picture quality is as good as you can expect of a non-anamorphic picture (less detail than in an anamorphic transfer). Colours are sufficiently rich and true. Black levels are OK. The Scots accent may be a challenge to some viewers. Unfortunately no subtitles are provided. Aside from the trailer, there are no extras.",4,"Lovely, intense little drama...

979729,A1283Z83HCLL36,B000EXDRUI,Heather Simmons,"[8, 9]","This was a very good movie that makes a person realize how fragile, short, and precious life really is.This is the story of Sarah (Valerie Edmond). Sarah moved from Scotland to New York to persue a business career, leaving behind her father and boyfriend. Years later, Sarah is informed that she has a brain tumor and only has a short amount of time to live. Sarah begins to think back in her life to when she was happiest and decides to return to Scotland. When she returns she reunites with her father, Frank (James Cosmo), and discovers that her childhood boyfriend, Sam (Gerard Butler), is married. Despite this fact, Sarah tells Sam's wife, Charlotte (Valerie Gogan), that she wants to spend the time she has left with her husband. This begins the journey into Sarah's final months where she plans her funeral arrangments (with excitement!), Developes a strong relationship with her father, and falls back in love with Sam.While I understand the nature of Sarah's intentions of spending time with her childhood friend, I found her to be very selfish and inconsiderate to Charlotte and Sam. There is nothing wrong with her wanting to spend time with Sam, but when things took a turn towards adultry, she should have set boundaries. Sarah consumed Sam's time and did whatever she wanted with him without thinking of Charlotte and her feelings. She also showed lack of care for Sam by becoming so involved with him. By starting a relationship with Sam, she caused Charlotte to leave him and when Sarah dies it leaves Sam with no one.This was a beautiful movie about life, but I found the victim in the movie to be the antagonist. I felt sorry for both Sam and Charlotte having their relationship shattered by the selfishness of a dying woman. If Sarah wanted to be with Sam so bad, she should have grabbed him up ten years ago when she has the chance. I think Sam was worth a little more than just ""The time she had left"".",4,Very Thought Provoking.

979730,A171FCUSCW4C8N,B000EXDRUI,"Janis Hendler ""filmfan""","[0, 0]","&#34;One More Kiss&#34; makes one wonder why sensitive, intelligent Gerard Butler gave up a promising dramatic and comic career for one of crassly commercial ass-kicking gut-busters.  Oh, that's right - if one caters to the lowest common denominator, one will make more money.  But this movie serves to remind that beneath the muscular exterior is a talented actor with a great sense of humor, and one can only hope he'll eventually be able to make the transition back to his more believable roots.All that said, Butler, at his youthfully, physically most appealing best, is merely a backdrop to Valerie Edmond's character, who is dying of Cancer.  Unfortunately, she is so selfishly self-indulgent throughout the movie that I found it impossible to give a rat's ass whether she died or not.  She barged into former boyfriend Butler's life, destroyed his marriage, and never seemed to feel a whit of responsibility.  Whereas the viewer is supposed to love her because she's the lead character and is a tragic one to boot, instead I found myself to be impatiently awaiting her personal reckoning and reformation, to see her regret the mess she made of the life of a man who was guilty of nothing worse than timelessly loving her.Because she plays a hand in salvaging the life of her lonely father, the viewer is supposed to exonerate her for the destructive role she plays in her ex-boyfriend's.  At the end of the movie, it's clear her father will begin a new and better life, while poor Butler will probably pine away for her for the rest of his.  Ms. Edmond's performance is excellent; but plain and simply, I didn't like her character and will not mourn her.I believe the problem with &#34;One More Kiss&#34; lies with the script, which is too superficial for the subject.

979738,A2UMOEBAND6BS5,B000EXDRUI,"M. J. Ward ""mojane""","[25, 25]","One More Kiss has beautiful cinematography, a lovely score, an interesting premise, and a badly cast role - Sarah (Valerie Edmund).From our first shot of her on the rooftop with arms outstretched, no matter what the cameraman and director do, they cannot make this into a woman who looks like she is sick, let alone dying.  She is too big, strong and healthy.  So I cannot feel her pain, sorrow and desparation.  In fact, I feel nothing, and that is bad for the role and the movie.On the other hand, the actress playing the wife, Charlotte (Valerie Gogan) is perfect at showing the panic, resentment and eventual hatred of this interloper in her life.  From the very first time she sets eyes on Sarah - in her husband Sams' (Gerard Butler) embrace, even just a friendly one - she is threatened.  (As I would have been; confess would YOU come into a room and see your husband with his arms around another woman as just another day at the office?)  When Sam introduces them, he even hesitates before he says ""my wife.""  What a slap in the face.Maybe I'm not seeing the romance in this situation.  When Sarah announces she is dying, Sam is nonplused; Charlotte sees trouble.  In the real world, right then I would have said, ""sorry to hear that and WE will help if WE can.  But that's not this movie.So we have THE LIST for Sam it get through.  Which is just a device to be able for Sarah to manipulate Sam into kindling a romance again.  And all the singing together, skydiving and kite-flying and lush background music doesn't make it anything but what it is - seduction of another womans husband.  Leading to predictable harsh words, fights and tears.  But Charlotte loves this man; she hugs his jacket and breathes in his smell; and cries in pain.Meanwhile, we have brave (?) Sarah planning her funeral down to what will be served at the afterparty!  I know this is to show her bravery, but I wanted to tell Sam to run out of that house - he is being manipulated.  As is her father.  Sarah may not be around much longer, but by God, everyone will remember her!  Too harsh?  Why does she show up at the restaurant just before Sam is to go meet his wife?  Didn't know about the concert?  Cummon.  His birthday! - she knew.  And she didn't care.  It was all about her - what she wanted.And that brings us to the most emotionally satisfying scenes in the film with the most beautiful music - Charlotte in her lovely dress, hair just right, sitting and waiting, waiting, waiting for her love and he never comes.  I DO feel HER pain.Where is Sam?  Why getting it on with his other love.  Sorry I'm underwhelmed.The last scenes in the hospital are done well, and Gerry is at his most beautiful and touching.  He almost redeems the whole film right there.  But not quite, for me at least.Sarah's father, played by James Cosmo, is very good and the part is to underscore the theme of the film - choices we make that alter life.Try as I might I just cannot see that the choice to break up your marriage (even if not perfect) for a few weeks of what? bliss? great sex? is worth ruining anothers life and possible your own.  The only one who ends satisfied is the interloper who we are to feel sorry for, and I just can't do it.And, of course, she is gone and I suppose, rests in peace.Rated 6/10.Jane",3,Choices that alter life---,1154044800,"07 28, 2006",2006,3290,"['One', 'More', 'Kiss', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'lovely', 'score', 'interesting', 'premise', 'badly', 'cast', 'role', 'Sarah', 'Valerie', 'Edmund', 'first', 'shot', 'rooftop', 'arms', 'outstretched', 'matter', 'what', 'cameraman', 'director', 'do', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'woman', 'who', 'sick', 'let', 'alone', 'dying', 'too', 'big', 'strong', 'healthy', 'can', 'not', 'feel', 'pain', 'sorrow', 'desparation', 'fact', 'feel', 'nothing', 'bad', 'role', 'movie.On', 'other', 'hand', 'actress', 'playing', 'wife', 'Charlotte', 'Valerie', 'Gogan', 'perfect', 'showing', 'panic', 'resentment', 'eventual', 'hatred', 'interloper', 'life', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'eyes', 'Sarah', 'husband', 'Sams', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'embrace', 'even', 'just', 'friendly', 'one', 'threatened', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'confess', 'would', 'YOU', 'come', 'room', 'see', 'husband', 'arms', 'woman', 'just', 'day', 'office', 'When', 'Sam', 'even', 'wife', 'What', 'slap', 'face.Maybe', ""'m"", 'not', 'seeing', 'romance', 'situation', 'When', 'Sarah', 'dying', 'Sam', 'nonplused', 'Charlotte', 'trouble', 'real', 'world', 'right', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'said', 'sorry', 'hear', 'WE', 'will', 'help', 'WE', 'can', 'not', 'movie.So', 'have', 'LIST', 'Sam', 'get', 'Which', 'just', 'device', 'be', 'able', 'Sarah', 'manipulate', 'Sam', 'kindling', 'romance', 'again', 'singing', 'together', 'skydiving', 'kite-flying', 'lush', 'background', 'music', ""n't"", 'make', 'anything', 'what', 'seduction', 'womans', 'husband', 'Leading', 'predictable', 'harsh', 'words', 'fights', 'tears', 'Charlotte', 'man', 'hugs', 'jacket', 'breathes', 'smell', 'cries', 'pain.Meanwhile', 'have', 'brave', 'Sarah', 'planning', 'funeral', 'down', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'served', 'afterparty', 'know', 'show', 'bravery', 'wanted', 'tell', 'Sam', 'run', 'out', 'house', 'being', 'manipulated', 'father', 'Sarah', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'around', 'much', 'longer', 'God', 'everyone', 'will', 'remember', 'Too', 'harsh', 'Why', 'show', 'up', 'restaurant', 'just', 'Sam', 'go', 'meet', 'wife', 'Did', ""n't"", 'know', 'concert', 'Cummon', 'birthday', 'knew', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'was', 'what', 'wanted.And', 'most', 'emotionally', 'satisfying', 'scenes', 'film', 'most', 'beautiful', 'music', 'Charlotte', 'lovely', 'dress', 'hair', 'just', 'right', 'sitting', 'waiting', 'waiting', 'waiting', 'love', 'never', 'DO', 'feel', 'HER', 'pain.Where', 'Sam', 'Why', 'getting', 'other', 'love', 'Sorry', ""'m"", 'underwhelmed.The', 'last', 'scenes', 'hospital', 'are', 'done', 'well', 'Gerry', 'most', 'beautiful', 'touching', 'almost', 'whole', 'film', 'right', 'there', 'not', 'quite', 'least.Sarah', 'father', 'played', 'James', 'Cosmo', 'very', 'good', 'part', 'underscore', 'theme', 'film', 'choices', 'make', 'alter', 'life.Try', 'might', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'choice', 'break', 'up', 'marriage', 'even', 'not', 'perfect', 'few', 'weeks', 'what', 'bliss', 'great', 'sex', 'worth', 'ruining', 'anothers', 'life', 'possible', 'own', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'satisfied', 'interloper', 'who', 'are', 'feel', 'sorry', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'it.And', 'course', 'gone', 'suppose', 'rests', 'peace.Rated', '6/10.Jane']",N/A

Then she makes Sam's Wife angry with the fact they're spending a lot of time together, and he's rarely with her.

After an experimental cancer treatment goes wrong and it kills her, Sam's world falls apart when he gets back from her funeral and there are three very large bags sitting in front of the entrance to the front door.  Ending the Movie.  Gerard Butler and the rest of the crew were very good in this movie, But I don't blame the wife for her anger towards the ex GF who after 7 yrs comes back into his life only after she finds she's dying of cancer and realizes Sam(Gerard Butler) was the only man she ever loved. To me she was selfish to stroll back into his life and not care about what it would do to his marriage.  I mean she could have asked Sam if he was interested in coming to New York with her when she was leaving, instead of just leaving and wham! or when she got settled in NY given him her address and asked him to come.
