922959,A3W0VIPTDIFIKC,B000A6T23U,AWVA,"[0, 0]","My kids love this movie, age 3.5 and 13 months. Every year we DVR this movie and watch it I don't know, 2 times a day for a month. Well, not anymore!! Now we can watch it whenever we want. In fact it just traveled to Mexico with us and still hasn't gotten worn out. Who doesn't love a little story that secretly teaches kids that it's not only OK to be different, but it's really an awesome special thing also that needs to be celebrated. And let's not forget the songs, even I find myself singing them when heading down the hall, and the boys just LOVE when we all three start belting them out. YIPPY for Spookley!!",5,we don't have to wait for halloween anymore...,1352505600,"11 10, 2012",2012,616,"['kids', 'love', 'movie', 'age', '3.5', '13', 'months', 'year', 'DVR', 'movie', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', '2', 'times', 'day', 'month', 'Well', 'not', 'anymore', 'Now', 'can', 'watch', 'whenever', 'want', 'fact', 'just', 'traveled', 'Mexico', 'still', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'worn', 'out', 'Who', ""n't"", 'love', 'little', 'story', 'secretly', 'kids', 'not', 'only', 'OK', 'be', 'different', 'really', 'awesome', 'special', 'thing', 'also', 'be', 'celebrated', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'songs', 'even', 'find', 'singing', 'when', 'heading', 'down', 'hall', 'boys', 'just', 'LOVE', 'when', 'three', 'start', 'belting', 'out', 'YIPPY', 'Spookley']",N/A
