746510,A2RQS7X7FI3C6E,B00008PW1F,AAI,"[4, 5]","If you are just getting into the Sopranos this might not be the season for you. I personally think it is the weakest of all the seasons but none the less it is good and there is great continuation of character development. In other words Start watching from season one.  This season isn't the most action orientated and that let alot of viewers down.  I for one don't need to see action every second, the Sopranos aren't that type of show, and the Sopranos always has delivers on all fours when it comes to plot and drama.  This season was more of a focus on the marriage of Tony and Carmella and as you see in the season finale ""White Caps"", everything comes to an end.  That episode is explosive (drama wise), and is one of the best Sopranos episodes.  It leaves the door wide open for Season Five, which debuts on HBO on March 7th.This season focuses on developing the other characters on this show.  I mean Tony Soprano is cool, but this show would get very stale if it was all about him.  You see the rise of characters like Johnny Sack, Ralph Cifareto and Christopher Moltisanti as they rise to greater mafia power.  There is a very memorable fight scene in the episode, ""Who Ever Did This?"" with two ""made men"", and it is very graphic and gory.  This isn't a show for immature people, because last year some kids killed their mother in the same fashion from that famous scene.Like I said earlier, this season did disapoint some and it did start to resemble a soap opera at times but don't let that sidetrack the truth of the Sopranos.  It is the best show on television and season four is a must buy for all Soprano fans.  Definetely check out this season and enjoy it because ""Nothing lasts forever"" and the Sopranos is a modern day classic.",4,Another knockout season from David Chase & co.,1073606400,"01 9, 2004",2004,1749,"['are', 'just', 'getting', 'Sopranos', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'season', 'personally', 'think', 'weakest', 'seasons', 'none', 'less', 'good', 'great', 'continuation', 'character', 'development', 'other', 'words', 'Start', 'watching', 'season', 'one', 'season', ""n't"", 'most', 'action', 'orientated', 'let', 'alot', 'viewers', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'action', 'second', 'Sopranos', 'are', ""n't"", 'type', 'show', 'Sopranos', 'always', 'delivers', 'fours', 'when', 'plot', 'drama', 'season', 'was', 'more', 'focus', 'marriage', 'Tony', 'Carmella', 'see', 'season', 'finale', 'White', 'Caps', 'everything', 'end', 'episode', 'explosive', 'drama', 'wise', 'one', 'best', 'Sopranos', 'episodes', 'door', 'wide', 'open', 'Season', 'Five', 'HBO', 'March', '7th.This', 'season', 'focuses', 'developing', 'other', 'characters', 'show', 'mean', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'cool', 'show', 'would', 'get', 'very', 'stale', 'was', 'see', 'rise', 'characters', 'Johnny', 'Sack', 'Ralph', 'Cifareto', 'Christopher', 'Moltisanti', 'rise', 'greater', 'mafia', 'power', 'very', 'memorable', 'fight', 'scene', 'episode', 'Who', 'Ever', 'Did', 'two', 'made', 'men', 'very', 'graphic', 'gory', ""n't"", 'show', 'immature', 'people', 'last', 'year', 'kids', 'killed', 'mother', 'same', 'fashion', 'famous', 'scene.Like', 'said', 'earlier', 'season', 'did', 'disapoint', 'did', 'start', 'resemble', 'soap', 'opera', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'sidetrack', 'truth', 'Sopranos', 'best', 'show', 'television', 'season', 'four', 'must', 'buy', 'Soprano', 'fans', 'Definetely', 'check', 'out', 'season', 'enjoy', 'Nothing', 'forever', 'Sopranos', 'modern', 'day', 'classic']",The Sopranos: Season 4

I will tell why this season is different and why it got some bad press. Everyone knows that The Sopranos broke all the rules and set the bar high for itself, for HBO, and for TV in general. The first three seasons were marked with intensity, vulgarity, and, most importantly, violence. Season 4 did have violence in it (perhaps one of the most violent episode, in fact) yet the intensity was one of a different kind. Remember that this was the first season to come out after the events of September 11th. This season is a progression into the lives of the Soprano family, and ultimately their subsequent crumbling. Season 4 is The Sopranos as family drama, a hat it wears well. Regardless of what popular opinion has said, there is no disputing that there are major rumblings in the fourth season; anyone interested in the series cannot ignore the fact that this season is pivotal in that it will help the show's momentum in its final years.",5,Season 4 - The Change of Pace,1078704000,"03 8, 2004",2004,1011,"['am', 'not', 'going', 'give', 'episode-by-episode', 'retelling', 'season', 'will', 'tell', 'why', 'season', 'different', 'why', 'got', 'bad', 'press', 'Everyone', 'Sopranos', 'broke', 'rules', 'set', 'bar', 'high', 'HBO', 'TV', 'general', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'were', 'marked', 'intensity', 'vulgarity', 'most', 'importantly', 'violence', 'Season', '4', 'did', 'have', 'violence', 'perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'violent', 'episode', 'fact', 'yet', 'intensity', 'was', 'one', 'different', 'kind', 'Remember', 'was', 'first', 'season', 'come', 'out', 'events', 'September', '11th', 'season', 'progression', 'lives', 'Soprano', 'family', 'ultimately', 'subsequent', 'crumbling', 'Season', '4', 'Sopranos', 'family', 'drama', 'hat', 'well', 'Regardless', 'what', 'popular', 'opinion', 'said', 'disputing', 'are', 'major', 'rumblings', 'fourth', 'season', 'anyone', 'interested', 'series', 'can', 'not', 'ignore', 'fact', 'season', 'pivotal', 'will', 'help', 'show', 'momentum', 'final', 'years']",The Sopranos: Season 4

746516,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00008PW1F,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Season Four was a turning point in the show for me.  I have always been in love with this show, from its conception even, but within the fourth season lies the root of my lust.  This season is, for me at least, the definition of perfect entertainment.  What this season does so magically is really flesh out Tony's home life, from his wife to his children, and delivers for us a brilliant scope into what makes this man who he is.  The season is filled to the brim with relationships, both business and personal, getting started and even coming to bitter ends.With the start of the season we immediately realize that this is going to be one of those seasons to set things in motion, especially when concerning a certain young lady named Adriana.  Yes, the same Adriana who has played second fiddle to Christopher is now finally stepping out of her comfort zone and making herself heard.  In fact, I'm tempted to say that Drea de Matteo is probably the most impressive and valuable asset to the cast for both season four and season five.  Season four spends a lot of its time establishing a relationship between Adriana and the feds, beginning with her friendship with an undercover agent named Danielle that ends badly, ultimately resulting in Adriana being nearly forced to leak information to the cops.Tony though, and his relationships inside and outside work, are the true focus of the season and any season for that matter.  A strain between Carmela and himself is established relatively quickly as she quarrels about their finances and establishing some sort of trust fund for her and children in case Tony were to die.  Finances are something Tony is becoming increasingly worried about with the slowing economy but he's reluctant to get involved in something he's not comfortable with, regardless of Carmela's feelings on the matter.  Carmela is not the only one giving Tony grief though.  Meadow is taking it upon herself to plan a trip to Europe against her parent's wishes, putting school on hold for a year to come into her own.  This season was a nice push for Jamie-Lynn Sigler.  She really took hold of Meadow and steered her in a great direction, acting wise.  It's funny how as each season progresses you want to just take both Meadow and Anthony Jr. aside and smack some sense into them, but it's the beauty within the acting that helps establish those feelings in the audience.On the business side of things Tony continues to have to put up with certain someone's who only seem to bring him trouble.  For starters Paulie, in jail on a firearms charge, begins to stir things up from behind bars between Carmine and Ralph, thus causing major problems for Tony as he attempts to make things right.  Ralph never fails to get on everyone's bad side, from making comments about Carmine's wife to frustrating Tony, and he further twists the knife by starting a relationship with Tony's sister Janice despite being in a serious relationship with Rosalie Aprile.  Ralph is also seeing the beautiful Valentina who just happens to take a liking to Tony, and visa-versa.  Ralph also brings a beautiful horse, a race horse that Tony takes a liking to.  This horse is the eventual chink in the chain that is Tony and Ralph's relationship.Tony's relationship with Artie is also tested when Artie borrows money for a deal that seems too good to be true.  When he's ultimately screwed out of the money he finds himself indebted to Tony and this causes a major rift in their friendship.As Tony and Carmela drift apart Carmela finds herself infatuated with Furio.  As the season progresses their relationship becomes dangerous.  Furio finds himself falling in love with Carmela but realizes that being the bosses wife means she is off limits to him and this is further cemented when he visits his family back home in Italy.  As Tony contemplates what to do in regards to his wife's incessant nagging for some sort of financial stability he begins to integrate her cousin Brian into the business as he advises Tony of ways to increase his wallet size.The acting this season is once again superb beyond words.  James Gandolfini is god in my book as he continues to outact and outshine just about any and every actor he comes in contact with.  His portrayal of Tony Soprano can stand its ground against some of the most legendary and highly lauded performances ever given.  Edie Falco also brings her A-Game to this season, as always, and this is proven with that final episode that brutally brings Carmela and Tony's relationship to a boiling point.  Those two Emmys were well, well deserved.  Aside from Drea and Michael Imperioli, who are brilliant, standouts include the always effortless Dominic Chianese who continues to mold Uncle Junior into an essential character.  Aida Turturro is just getting better and better as each season progresses and this is no exception.  Steve Schirripa also gets a boost towards the end of the season where he becomes more than just Junior's caretaker.  Tony Sirico and Vincent Curatola continue to ignite with their dynamic performances and newcomer Leslie Bega sizzles as Valentina, leaving a lasting impact on Tony as well as the audience.In the end season four is far from a disappointment, in fact it is one of my favorite seasons for it does so well what this show is supposed to do.  It helps form ties to the cast of characters and further cements them into our hearts.  If I've said it once I've said it a thousand times...there is no show that can even compete in the same league as `The Sopranos' and I'm pretty certain there never will be.",5,Without doubt the

A cross between The Godfather and the traditional nuclear sitcom family, the show provided a unique experience for a niche audience that quickly developed into a barrage of dedicated fans. Nominated for countless Emmy's, and winner of at least four in every one of its seasons except Season 2 (in which it carried home one), The Sopranos has cemented itself as one of the elite shows in television history...Golden Globe performer James Gandolfini plays the title role of Tony Soprano, a middle-aged father of two, loving husband, and successful businessman. But contrary to a typical sitcom, Tony finds himself irritated by his kids Anthony and Meadow (Robert Iler and Jamie Lynn Sigler), he cheats on his wife Carmela (Edie Falco), and the business organization responsible for his success is the mafia (of which he is the local boss). All the confusion in Tony's life leads to massive amounts of stress, prompting him to regularly visit a therapist, Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco) - one of the few outsiders he trusts. Following a classic prime time soap opera format, quite similar to the hit TV show Dallas, The Sopranos provides audiences with a glimpse into the life and times of a mafia boss, where we find out that being a mob kingpin isn't the glamour life often portrayed in the movies...The Sopranos (Season 4) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""For All Debts Public and Private"" in which Tony and Carmela deal with the strain on their household finances in the midst of a recession, and Adrianna brings a friend of great interest to the Soprano family dinner. Meanwhile, Tony creates a special bond with Christopher when he gives his blessing for Christopher to avenge his father's murder... Other notable episodes from Season 4 include ""No Show"" in which Meadow has a fallout with Tony and Carmela when she decides to drop out of college and travel the European continent, and ""Pie-O-My"" in which Tony develops a deep interest in Ralphie's new race horse, prompting him to spend more time away from home than Carmela likes...Below is a list of episodes included on The Sopranos (Season 4) DVD:Episode 40 (For All Debts Public and Private)Episode 41 (No Show)Episode 42 (Christopher)Episode 43 (The Weight)Episode 44 (Pie-O-My)Episode 45 (Everybody Hurts)Episode 46 (Watching Too Much Television)Episode 47 (Mergers & Acquisitions)Episode 48 (Whoever Did This)Episode 49 (The Strong, Silent Type)Episode 50 (Calling All Cars)Episode 51 (Eloise)Episode 52 (Whitecaps)The DVD Report",5,A truly great series...,1113955200,"04 20, 2005",2005,2690,"['Sex', 'City', 'HBO', 'original', 'series', 'Sopranos', 'took', 'world', 'storm', 'late-1990s', 'cutting', 'edge', 'drama', 'acerbic', 'wit', 'cross', 'Godfather', 'traditional', 'nuclear', 'sitcom', 'family', 'show', 'provided', 'unique', 'experience', 'niche', 'audience', 'quickly', 'developed', 'barrage', 'dedicated', 'fans', 'Nominated', 'countless', 'Emmy', 'winner', 'least', 'four', 'one', 'seasons', 'Season', '2', 'carried', 'home', 'one', 'Sopranos', 'cemented', 'one', 'elite', 'television', 'history', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'performer', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'title', 'role', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'middle-aged', 'father', 'two', 'loving', 'husband', 'successful', 'businessman', 'contrary', 'typical', 'sitcom', 'Tony', 'irritated', 'kids', 'Anthony', 'Meadow', 'Robert', 'Iler', 'Jamie', 'Lynn', 'Sigler', 'wife', 'Carmela', 'Edie', 'Falco', 'business', 'organization', 'responsible', 'success', 'mafia', 'local', 'boss', 'confusion', 'Tony', 'life', 'massive', 'amounts', 'stress', 'prompting', 'regularly', 'visit', 'therapist', 'Dr.', 'Jennifer', 'Melfi', 'Lorraine', 'Bracco', 'one', 'few', 'outsiders', 'Following', 'classic', 'prime', 'time', 'soap', 'opera', 'format', 'quite', 'similar', 'hit', 'TV', 'show', 'Dallas', 'Sopranos', 'audiences', 'glimpse', 'life', 'times', 'mafia', 'boss', 'where', 'find', 'out', 'being', 'mob', 'kingpin', ""n't"", 'glamour', 'life', 'often', 'portrayed', 'movies', 'Sopranos', 'Season', '4', 'DVD', 'number', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Debts', 'Public', 'Private', 'Tony', 'Carmela', 'deal', 'strain', 'household', 'finances', 'midst', 'recession', 'Adrianna', 'friend', 'great', 'interest', 'Soprano', 'family', 'dinner', 'Meanwhile', 'Tony', 'special', 'bond', 'Christopher', 'when', 'blessing', 'Christopher', 'avenge', 'father', 'murder', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '4', 'include', 'Show', 'Meadow', 'fallout', 'Tony', 'Carmela', 'when', 'drop', 'college', 'travel', 'European', 'continent', 'Pie-O-My', 'Tony', 'deep', 'interest', 'Ralphie', 'new', 'race', 'horse', 'prompting', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'away', 'home', 'Carmela', 'likes', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Sopranos', 'Season', '4', 'DVD', 'Episode', '40', 'Debts', 'Public', 'Private', 'Episode', '41', 'No', 'Show', 'Episode', '42', 'Christopher', 'Episode', '43', 'Weight', 'Episode', '44', 'Pie-O-My', 'Episode', '45', 'Everybody', 'Hurts', 'Episode', '46', 'Watching', 'Too', 'Much', 'Television', 'Episode', '47', 'Mergers', 'Acquisitions', 'Episode', '48', 'Whoever', 'Did', 'Episode', '49', 'Strong', 'Silent', 'Type', 'Episode', '50', 'Calling', 'Cars', 'Episode', '51', 'Eloise', 'Episode', '52', 'Whitecaps', 'DVD', 'Report']",The Sopranos: Season 4
746526,AS558SNWF1DXG,B00008PW1F,Clare Quilty,"[0, 0]","Riddled with subplots that explored loss and sudden tragedy, the just-out-on-DVD &quot;The Sopranos: Season Four&quot; appeared on HBO 16 long months after a hugely popular third season and almost immediately underwhelmed a lot of viewers.  Season four started out slow, and found its characters blanketed under a haze of post-9/11 anxiety, but finished as one of the better volumes in this vivid, violent soap opera about New Jersey mob boss Tony Soprano and his strangely compelling families.And, anyway, the show's generally slow pace has always been one of the qualities that makes it so rich. Unlike most network programs, ""The Sopranos"" never seems to be in any hurry to reach a conclusion, the episodes play out like chapters of a novel, and when something big or dramatic happens, the twists are much more shocking and effective.Despite its sullen pace, and a not-too-convincing flirtation between Carmella and sensitive thug Furio, &quot;Season Four&quot; was still full of completely satisfying moments: the slow descent of Tony's sidekick Christopher into heroin addiction, and the hilarious intervention that helped pull him out of it; the sad demise of Tony's mistress Gloria, his racehorse Pie-O-My and his psychotic cohort Ralphie (who checked out in one of the series' best and grisliest episodes); and the raw season-capping split between Tony and Carmella.TV series on video are basically review-proof. Hardly anyone is going to buy or rent a series unless they know and like it. But in a steadily growing DVD market that's suddenly crammed with box-sets of TV shows barely worth remembering (much less shelling out 30-100 bucks for) it's good to see a show, like ""The Sopranos,"" that's actually worth preserving.",5,Everybody had a hard year....,1068508800,"11 11, 2003",2003,1731,"['Riddled', 'subplots', 'explored', 'loss', 'sudden', 'tragedy', 'just-out-on-DVD', 'quot', 'Sopranos', 'Season', 'Four', 'quot', 'appeared', 'HBO', '16', 'long', 'months', 'hugely', 'popular', 'third', 'season', 'almost', 'immediately', 'underwhelmed', 'lot', 'viewers', 'Season', 'four', 'started', 'out', 'slow', 'found', 'characters', 'blanketed', 'haze', 'post-9/11', 'anxiety', 'finished', 'one', 'better', 'volumes', 'vivid', 'violent', 'soap', 'opera', 'New', 'Jersey', 'mob', 'boss', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'strangely', 'compelling', 'families.And', 'anyway', 'show', 'generally', 'slow', 'pace', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'qualities', 'so', 'rich', 'most', 'network', 'programs', 'Sopranos', 'never', 'be', 'hurry', 'reach', 'conclusion', 'episodes', 'play', 'out', 'chapters', 'novel', 'when', 'something', 'big', 'dramatic', 'happens', 'twists', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'shocking', 'effective.Despite', 'sullen', 'pace', 'not-too-convincing', 'flirtation', 'Carmella', 'sensitive', 'thug', 'Furio', 'quot', 'Season', 'Four', 'quot', 'was', 'still', 'full', 'completely', 'satisfying', 'moments', 'slow', 'descent', 'Tony', 'sidekick', 'Christopher', 'heroin', 'addiction', 'hilarious', 'intervention', 'helped', 'pull', 'sad', 'demise', 'Tony', 'mistress', 'Gloria', 'racehorse', 'Pie-O-My', 'psychotic', 'cohort', 'Ralphie', 'who', 'checked', 'out', 'one', 'series', 'best', 'grisliest', 'episodes', 'raw', 'season-capping', 'split', 'Tony', 'Carmella.TV', 'series', 'video', 'are', 'basically', 'review-proof', 'Hardly', 'anyone', 'going', 'buy', 'rent', 'series', 'know', 'steadily', 'growing', 'DVD', 'market', 'suddenly', 'crammed', 'box-sets', 'TV', 'shows', 'barely', 'remembering', 'much', 'less', 'shelling', 'out', '30-100', 'bucks', 'good', 'see', 'show', 'Sopranos', 'actually', 'worth', 'preserving']",The Sopranos: Season 4

Kutinsky ""ekutinsky""","[3, 3]","Season 4 is a lightning rod for Sopranos criticism - certain plots go on too long and certain plots are so uninteresting, they're offensive (Paulie's mom at Green Grove anyone?).  Still, the masterful sleight of hand David Chase pulls on us is our complacency in thinking the show is all blood and bravado.  This is a show that recognizes the fullness of its characters' lives, the complexity and their consequences.  That means that some episodes that were trashed on the season's original airings are masterpieces of characterization, in their bold turns in the screenplay and their endlessly fearless performances.  I'm thinking not of Ralphy's surprise murder (a great turn, to be sure), but of Adriana's desperation after being tapped by the feds (""Pie-o-My""), Johnny Sack's arrogant but touching overreaction to the jokes against his wife (""The Weight""), or of the bizarre interation throughout the season of Bobby Baccala's grief and Janice's opportunism.  Each actor rises marvelously to their challenge without ever getting showy in their attempt, but for one actor, it'll go into some television record book eventually - Edie Falco's performance during the season is so overwhelmingly astonishing, you don't quite know what to do with it.  Fusing anger, loneliness, a desperation for intimacy, lust, jealousy, codependence, and a need for independence often all in the same glance, she goes further than any performance, female or male, in television history.  That makes even the weakest of the 4th season episodes compulsively watchable (as in ""Mergers and Acquisitions,"" for which her theft of Tony's money from the birdfeeder is the only interesting plotline).",4,"Weaker Sopranos, but with more gems than you'd expect",1108684800,"02 18, 2005",2005,1674,"['Season', '4', 'lightning', 'rod', 'Sopranos', 'criticism', 'certain', 'plots', 'go', 'too', 'long', 'certain', 'plots', 'are', 'so', 'uninteresting', ""'re"", 'offensive', 'Paulie', 'mom', 'Green', 'Grove', 'anyone', 'Still', 'masterful', 'sleight', 'hand', 'David', 'Chase', 'complacency', 'thinking', 'show', 'blood', 'bravado', 'show', 'fullness', 'characters', 'lives', 'complexity', 'consequences', 'episodes', 'were', 'trashed', 'season', 'original', 'airings', 'are', 'masterpieces', 'characterization', 'bold', 'turns', 'screenplay', 'endlessly', 'fearless', 'performances', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'not', 'Ralphy', 'surprise', 'murder', 'great', 'turn', 'be', 'sure', 'Adriana', 'desperation', 'being', 'tapped', 'feds', 'Pie-o-My', 'Johnny', 'Sack', 'arrogant', 'touching', 'overreaction', 'jokes', 'wife', 'Weight', 'bizarre', 'interation', 'season', 'Bobby', 'Baccala', 'grief', 'Janice', 'opportunism', 'actor', 'marvelously', 'challenge', 'ever', 'getting', 'showy', 'attempt', 'one', 'actor', ""'ll"", 'go', 'television', 'record', 'book', 'eventually', 'Edie', 'Falco', 'performance', 'season', 'so', 'overwhelmingly', 'astonishing', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'Fusing', 'anger', 'loneliness', 'desperation', 'intimacy', 'lust', 'jealousy', 'codependence', 'need', 'independence', 'often', 'same', 'glance', 'further', 'performance', 'female', 'male', 'television', 'history', 'even', 'weakest', '4th', 'season', 'episodes', 'compulsively', 'watchable', 'Mergers', 'Acquisitions', 'theft', 'Tony', 'money', 'birdfeeder', 'only', 'interesting', 'plotline']",The Sopranos: Season 4

For two years the show was smart, ironic, had great characters and moved along at a good pace. Interesting ideas were explored: the disillusionment of the descendants of Italian immigrants who go back to the ""old country"" only to find it's changed, the growing obsession of Dr. Melfi with ""bad boy"" Tony, the internal power struggles within the ""family."" Then some time during season 3 the writers began to lose their way. They killed off two great characters (Tony's mother and Richie) and basically neutered a third (Dr. Melfi). The problem was that the writers ran out of premise. ""Mob boss goes to see therapist"" can only be spun out for just so long. Then you have to think of something else, and turning the show into a soap opera simply didn't cut it. By season 4 there was nothing left of the original humor or intelligence. Dr. Melfi's perspective- which was so important as a counterpoint to Tony's - was absent, and the pace dragged horribly. Tony Soprano's kids continued to be brats, Tony continued to have ""issues with impulsivity,"" affairs continued to happen (although with fewer strippers), and people got shot. But there was no real reason to care, because there were no stakes. It's a shame, because this show did not have to fizzle. With a little long range plot and character development, it could have been great.

A mention of the tragedy is made in the first episode of this season.  Tony is still wanting for his ducks to return.  Tony Soprano is still a bad son of a gun.  Abusive to his bartender for showing concern.  His wife is pressuring him for more money.  He then pressures his crime-organization for more money.  The thing is Tony has loads of cash hidden in a secret concrete safe near the main house.  His family doesn't even know about it.  He has a secret safe outside too.  Now the daughter has to see a psychiatrist.  The first Soprano trial begins after 16 years.  Disagreements get serious between the Italians and the Indians.  Tony Jr. becomes worse in behavior.  Tony Sr. gets involved in horse-racing wagering and of course more affairs with women.  Dirt hits the fan for Tony.  It's the wrath of Tony's wife.

Then the show returned to the air for its fourth season in September 2002. And the wait was worth it. Season four of ""The Sopranos"" was as effective as it's three previous seasons (though still not up there with the memorable first season). The acting, writing, and directing is still top-notch in season four. The show got 13 Emmy nominations for its fourth season. The strong acting by James Gandolfini and Edie Falco paid off again: both won their third Emmys for Best Actor and Actress in a Drama Series, and deservedly so (Gandolfini won previously for seasons two and three; Falco won previously for seasons one and three). This was thanks in part to the final episode of season four, titled ""Whitecaps"". This is the episode where Carmela decides that she's had enough of Tony's philandering and stands up to him by throwing him out of their house. Falco has done alot of great acting on ""The Sopranos"", but her performance in this episode is easily her best. Also winning an Emmy for season four was Joe Pantoliano, who won for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his chilling role as the psychopathic Ralph, and the writing team again was honored with an Emmy for the third time in the show's history. Other memorable storylines from season four include: Christopher fighting a massive drug addiction; Uncle Junior's trial; Carmela's major attraction to Tony's driver Furio (a character introduced back in season two); and Adriana finding out that her new friend actually works for the FBI. ""The Sopranos"" has never disappointed since it hit the airwaves in 1999, and season four continues to be proof of that.",5,The Sopranos: Season Four,1142467200,"03 16, 2006",2006,1748,"['third', 'season', 'Sopranos', 'finished', 'airing', 'May', '2001', 'mob', 'series', 'went', 'long', 'hiatus', '16', 'months', 'Then', 'show', 'returned', 'air', 'fourth', 'season', 'September', '2002', 'wait', 'was', 'worth', 'Season', 'four', 'Sopranos', 'was', 'as', 'effective', 'three', 'previous', 'seasons', 'still', 'not', 'there', 'memorable', 'first', 'season', 'acting', 'writing', 'directing', 'still', 'top-notch', 'season', 'four', 'show', 'got', '13', 'Emmy', 'nominations', 'fourth', 'season', 'strong', 'acting', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'Edie', 'Falco', 'paid', 'off', 'again', 'won', 'third', 'Emmys', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Actress', 'Drama', 'Series', 'deservedly', 'so', 'Gandolfini', 'won', 'previously', 'seasons', 'two', 'three', 'Falco', 'won', 'previously', 'seasons', 'one', 'three', 'was', 'thanks', 'part', 'final', 'episode', 'season', 'four', 'titled', 'Whitecaps', 'episode', 'where', 'Carmela', 'had', 'enough', 'Tony', 'philandering', 'up', 'throwing', 'house', 'Falco', 'done', 'alot', 'great', 'acting', 'Sopranos', 'performance', 'episode', 'easily', 'best', 'Also', 'winning', 'Emmy', 'season', 'four', 'was', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'who', 'won', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Drama', 'Series', 'chilling', 'role', 'psychopathic', 'Ralph', 'writing', 'team', 'again', 'was', 'honored', 'Emmy', 'third', 'time', 'show', 'history', 'Other', 'memorable', 'storylines', 'season', 'four', 'include', 'Christopher', 'fighting', 'massive', 'drug', 'addiction', 'Uncle', 'Junior', 'trial', 'Carmela', 'major', 'attraction', 'Tony', 'driver', 'Furio', 'character', 'introduced', 'back', 'season', 'two', 'Adriana', 'finding', 'out', 'new', 'friend', 'actually', 'FBI', 'Sopranos', 'never', 'disappointed', 'hit', 'airwaves', '1999', 'season', 'four', 'be', 'proof']",The Sopranos: Season 4

746550,A3KVUF77EDW1HS,B00008PW1F,J.R.E,"[13, 13]","Upon its original airing, the fourth season of The Sopranos provoked a vocal and hostile response from the show's fans.  Nothing happens, they would complain.  The episodes wander aimlessly from one to the next.  Plot lines are brought up and then dropped.  Nobody gets whacked.Viewers watching during its original airing can be excused for so thinking.  Viewed one episode at a time, one week at a time, it was easy to feel dragged along.  It is no secret that The Sopranos wasn't built to last and was never really intended to go on past three seasons; once its original conceit was used up, David Chase and the writers needed to find a new direction.As a result, Season Four has no overarching plot lines, such as Tony's rivalries with Junior or Ritchie, or clearly delineated character arcs like the downfall of Jackie Jr. or Tony's doomed relationship with Gloria.  Instead, much of the ""mafia"" story was dedicated to getting us better acquainted with the Soprano family's relationship with Johnny Sack, Carmine, and New York (storylines that pay off dividends in Season Five).  Moreover, from the very first episode, ""For All Debts Public and Private,"" Season Four has a sense of impending, post-9/11 dread; every week gave viewers the sense that something ""big"" was about to happen -- that Tony would discover Paulie ""talking out of school,"" that the Feds would put the screws into Adrianna, that Carmela would consummate her flirtations with Furio -- but it never did.  And when a major character did meet his untimely end, it came as an inevitability rather than a release.  The buildup of tension that was never released undoubtedly led to the frustration of many viewers.Still, on a second viewing, with Season Five behind us and without the suspense of waiting to find out what happens next, Season Four plays remarkably well.  On DVD, unbound from the constraints serial-viewing and the weekly suspense of waiting for a new episode, the pace of the season improves dramatically, and the richness of each episode becomes apparent.  ""No Show"" contrasts Meadow's post-adolescent ennui with Christopher's ""learning curve"" as acting capo.  ""Everybody Hurts"" and ""Watching Too Much Television"" are two of the best self-contained episodes of the series.  In addition to genuine suspense, ""The Weight"" shows us Johnny Sack's genuine affection for his overweight wife, foreshadowing events between Tony and Carmela.  ""Eloise"" puts the finishing touches on the portrait of Carmela's bourgeois hell-of-her-own-creation touched on in ""Second Opinion"" and ""Amour Fou"" (both Season Three).  The finale, ""Whitecaps,"" plays out like a 75-minute version of Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage; it's the most brutal episode of the series (despite the fact that no regular character is expended), with Gandolfini and Falco giving two of the most devastating performances on television.  Even the season's one true clunker ""Christopher"" -- a misguided course in Identity Politics 101 -- plays much better when you're not expecting anything more.In Season Four, we were still learning how to watch The Sopranos and learning the demands it places on the viewer.  Like life, it's messy.  Entropy and inertia triumph over the artifice of resolution and the fiction of ""closure.""  Conflicts are not resolved; they fester.  What seemed desperately important one day is crowded out by new pressures and priorities.  But this direction should be reason for celebration, not criticism.  If the series doesn't conform to audience expectations, aren't we the better for it?  In the 70s, they had a term for movies that didn't adopt standard notions of narrative form: they called them ""Art Films.""In the final analysis, if Season Four does not live up to prior seasons, it is only because Seasons One, Two, and Three set the bar so high.  (Compare Season 4 and the comparable season of, say, ER and then get back to me.)  Rather than trying to carry on as a pale imitation of its predecessors, in Season Four the series evolves in a new direction, demanding more of the viewer, but proving why The Sopranos is the best show in the history of television.",5,"Season Four, Reconsidered",1140998400,"02 27, 2006",2006,4132,"['original', 'airing', 'fourth', 'season', 'Sopranos', 'provoked', 'vocal', 'hostile', 'response', 'show', 'fans', 'Nothing', 'would', 'complain', 'episodes', 'wander', 'aimlessly', 'one', 'next', 'Plot', 'lines', 'are', 'brought', 'up', 'then', 'dropped', 'Nobody', 'whacked.Viewers', 'watching', 'original', 'airing', 'can', 'be', 'excused', 'so', 'thinking', 'Viewed', 'one', 'episode', 'time', 'one', 'week', 'time', 'was', 'easy', 'feel', 'dragged', 'along', 'secret', 'Sopranos', 'was', ""n't"", 'built', 'last', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'intended', 'go', 'past', 'three', 'seasons', 'once', 'original', 'conceit', 'was', 'used', 'up', 'David', 'Chase', 'writers', 'needed', 'find', 'new', 'direction.As', 'result', 'Season', 'Four', 'overarching', 'plot', 'lines', 'such', 'Tony', 'rivalries', 'Junior', 'Ritchie', 'clearly', 'delineated', 'character', 'arcs', 'downfall', 'Jackie', 'Jr.', 'Tony', 'doomed', 'relationship', 'Gloria', 'Instead', 'much', 'mafia', 'story', 'was', 'dedicated', 'getting', 'better', 'acquainted', 'Soprano', 'family', 'relationship', 'Johnny', 'Sack', 'Carmine', 'New', 'York', 'storylines', 'pay', 'off', 'dividends', 'Season', 'Five', 'Moreover', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'Debts', 'Public', 'Private', 'Season', 'Four', 'sense', 'impending', 'post-9/11', 'dread', 'week', 'gave', 'viewers', 'sense', 'something', 'big', 'was', 'happen', 'Tony', 'would', 'discover', 'Paulie', 'talking', 'school', 'Feds', 'would', 'put', 'screws', 'Adrianna', 'Carmela', 'would', 'consummate', 'flirtations', 'Furio', 'never', 'did', 'when', 'major', 'character', 'did', 'meet', 'untimely', 'end', 'came', 'inevitability', 'rather', 'release', 'buildup', 'tension', 'was', 'never', 'released', 'undoubtedly', 'led', 'frustration', 'many', 'viewers.Still', 'second', 'viewing', 'Season', 'Five', 'suspense', 'waiting', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'next', 'Season', 'Four', 'remarkably', 'well', 'DVD', 'unbound', 'constraints', 'serial-viewing', 'weekly', 'suspense', 'waiting', 'new', 'episode', 'pace', 'season', 'dramatically', 'richness', 'episode', 'apparent', 'Show', 'Meadow', 'post-adolescent', 'ennui', 'Christopher', 'learning', 'curve', 'acting', 'capo', 'Everybody', 'Watching', 'Too', 'Much', 'Television', 'are', 'two', 'best', 'self-contained', 'episodes', 'series', 'addition', 'genuine', 'suspense', 'Weight', 'Johnny', 'Sack', 'genuine', 'affection', 'overweight', 'wife', 'foreshadowing', 'events', 'Tony', 'Carmela', 'Eloise', 'finishing', 'touches', 'portrait', 'Carmela', 'bourgeois', 'hell-of-her-own-creation', 'touched', 'Second', 'Opinion', 'Amour', 'Fou', 'Season', 'Three', 'finale', 'Whitecaps', 'out', '75-minute', 'version', 'Bergman', 'Scenes', 'Marriage', 'most', 'brutal', 'episode', 'series', 'fact', 'regular', 'character', 'expended', 'Gandolfini', 'Falco', 'giving', 'two', 'most', 'devastating', 'performances', 'television', 'Even', 'season', 'one', 'true', 'clunker', 'Christopher', 'misguided', 'course', 'Identity', 'Politics', '101', 'plays', 'much', 'better', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'expecting', 'anything', 'more.In', 'Season', 'Four', 'were', 'still', 'learning', 'how', 'watch', 'Sopranos', 'learning', 'demands', 'viewer', 'life', 'messy', 'Entropy', 'inertia', 'triumph', 'artifice', 'resolution', 'fiction', 'closure', 'Conflicts', 'are', 'not', 'resolved', 'fester', 'What', 'seemed', 'desperately', 'important', 'one', 'day', 'crowded', 'out', 'new', 'pressures', 'priorities', 'direction', 'should', 'be', 'reason', 'celebration', 'not', 'criticism', 'series', ""n't"", 'conform', 'audience', 'expectations', 'are', ""n't"", 'better', '70s', 'had', 'term', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'adopt', 'standard', 'notions', 'narrative', 'form', 'called', 'Art', 'Films', 'final', 'analysis', 'Season', 'Four', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'prior', 'seasons', 'only', 'Seasons', 'One', 'Two', 'Three', 'set', 'bar', 'so', 'high', 'Compare', 'Season', '4', 'comparable', 'season', 'say', 'ER', 'then', 'get', 'back', 'Rather', 'trying', 'carry', 'pale', 'imitation', 'predecessors', 'Season', 'Four', 'series', 'new', 'direction', 'demanding', 'more', 'viewer', 'proving', 'why', 'Sopranos', 'best', 'show', 'history', 'television']",The Sopranos: Season 4

Very few dramatic series can even compare to The Sopranos where it entertains on all levels, from gripping drama to dead pan humorous moments.Combining the continued elements of extraordinary writing, superior direction and exceptional acting all make this fourth season another resounding success in the Sopranos series and a long wait until March of 2004 for the fifth season to kicks in.Episode

to him and he goes on a bloodthirsty quest for revenge which in the end brings both he and Ralph to the brink; Carmela and Furio begin to develop a more than interesting relationship and she and Tony continue to argue over their financial future.Pie O My - Ralph buys a race horse and invites Tony to the track and he suddenly finds a relationship similar to that which he had with the ducks in the first season and Adrianna becomes even more paranoid about her new friends when Christopher and the rest of the family starts using her club to conduct business.Everybody Hurts - Artie and Tony's relationship takes a new swing when Artie borrows money from Tony and the deal goes sour; Tony informs Christopher of his plan for the new chain of command but he's unaware of Christopher's ever increasing drug problem and Tony finds out what happened to Gloria which enrages him.Watching Too Much Television - Paulie is out of jail and he's holding a few grudges; Carmela's cousin Brian gives Tony some real estate advice that will continue to have repercussions throughout the rest of the season and Carmela and Furio continue to suppress their feelings for one another.Mergers & Acquisitions

with Tony; everybody starts to question Paulie's loyalty and Meadow invites her parents to her apartment for dinner and an interesting conversation ensues.Whitecaps - In this extraordinarily dramatic season finale; Carmela is suffering a broken heart; Tony attempts to keep the family together by buying a beachfront home which almost brings Carmela out of her doldrums until a fateful phone call from one of Tony's former girlfriends; everybody is loosing money on the Esplanade deal and Johnny makes a power play; and the Sopranos' marriage comes to a head, leaving everybody in great ""anticipation"" waiting until March of 2004 to see where this goes...  {ssintrepid}Episode list:For all Debts Public and PrivateNo-ShowChristopherThe WeightPie O MyEverybody HurtsWatching Too Much

746554,A1WQM564J3V3P2,B00008PW1F,Lacelle P. Howard,"[7, 13]",What I find interesting about Tony's character is that he has one foot in reality (his wife-and-children-family) and one in a world that we can only grasp through movies (thank God).  His ability to keep them separate amazes me.  His own family goes about like any other (remember Meadow getting upset when Tony might not be able to make her graduation--never mind that he had been cuffed and stuffed by the Feds.)  The only one-dimensional character is the son. His character is just space-filling and time-filling. Carmella is very complex and I admire her ability to not fade into the background.,5,Family Man,1058227200,"07 15, 2003",2003,599,"['What', 'find', 'interesting', 'Tony', 'character', 'one', 'foot', 'reality', 'wife-and-children-family', 'one', 'world', 'can', 'only', 'grasp', 'movies', 'thank', 'God', 'ability', 'keep', 'separate', 'own', 'family', 'other', 'remember', 'Meadow', 'getting', 'upset', 'when', 'Tony', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'graduation', 'never', 'mind', 'had', 'been', 'cuffed', 'stuffed', 'Feds', 'only', 'one-dimensional', 'character', 'son', 'character', 'just', 'space-filling', 'time-filling', 'Carmella', 'very', 'complex', 'admire', 'ability', 'not', 'fade', 'background']",The Sopranos: Season 4
746555,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,B00008PW1F,L.A. Scene,"[6, 6]","By the time ""The Sopranos"" entered its fourth season, it had solidified its standing as a ""weekly event"".  There aren't many television shows in the 50+ years of television history that can be put into this category.  A ""weekly event"" show basically has everyone talking about the episode the next day.  In the 1980s, shows such as ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty"" were ""weekly events"".  In the 1990s, ""Seinfeld"" would take emerge as the show that would become a ""weekly event"".  As Seinfeld wound up, another show would soon take that title into the 21st century - that show being HBO's ""The Sopranos"".  The first two seasons of the show not only established a show of high entertainment value, but a show that also was of high quality.  While the third season of the show was still good, I felt it fell short when compared to the first two years.  However, on  ""The Sopranos - The Complete Fourth Season"", the show comes back with a vengeance  - having its most solid season both quality and entertainment-wise from start to finish.The show focuses on an organized Italian-American crime family that is based in North Jersey.  The main character of the show is Tony Soprano played brilliantly by James Gandolfini.  Tony is the head of the fictional DiMeo crime family.  On the show, we see Tony try to balance his ""work"" in the DiMeo crime family with his home life.  Tony has suffered from panic attacks and depression and therefore sees a psychiatrist - Dr. Jennifer Melfi (played by Lorraine Bracco).Previous seasons of the Sopranos have had slow starts and weak finales.  However Season 4 gets off to a very quick start and keeps you hooked throughout the year.  Season 4 does a great job in the finale at tying together many of the storylines that had been prevalent throughout the year.  Here are some of the key storylines from Season 4:Here are some of the key storylines from Season 41-Friction begins to develop between the New Jersey DiMeo crime family and a New York crime family that the DiMeo's have been traditionally on good-terms with.  The show does a good job at building up the rivalry.2-Tony is continuing to have extra-martial affairs and it will continue to bother Carmela Soprano (played by Edie Falco).  In the meantime, an attraction develops between Carmela and one of Tony's ""men"", Furio Giunta (played by Federico Castelluccio).  Overall, I was a little disappointed the way the attraction played out between Carmela and Furio, but I was pleased that Furio got an expanded role this year.3-While solidifying himself as a part of Tony's ""inner circle"" of Made Men, Christopher Moltisanti (played by Michael Imperioli) is going to develop a very serious drug problem.4-Christopher's fianc&eacute;e Adriana La Cerva (played by Drea De Matteo) is going to develop a friendship with a woman posing as an undercover FBI agent.  This is eventually going to cause major personal agony for Adriana.5- Meadow Soprano (played by Jamie-Lynn Sigler)  is going to continue to be at College.  She is going to have to rebound from the death of Jackie Aprile, Jr. and eventually falls for a Dental Student.  Meanwhile, Anthony Soprano Jr. (played by Robert Iller) is going to start to see girlfriend of his own.6- Joe Pantoliano continues his outstanding portrayal of Tony's ""Capo"" Ralph (Ralphie) Cifaretto.  Ralphie is going to start to see Janice Soprano (played by Aida Turturro) and begin to have some friction with the New York Crime family.  We get to see another side of Ralphie when he his son is injured.7-Uncle Junior is going have a new health problem.  Most of his role during Season 4 is going to involve his long-awaited racketeering trial.8-Dr.Melfi's role seems more insignificant than ever.  While Tony continues his therapy into Season 4, once again the opportunity to expand her character and integrate her into the show fails.9-Investments are going to play a major theme during Season 4 for the the Soprano family.  Tony and Carmela are going to consider personal investments,  Tony's going to look at some business investments - and these are going to play a role in the friction with the New York Crime Family.10-Paulie Walnuts (played by Tony Sirico) starts out slow as he is in jail and seen seldom in the early episodes of Seaon 4.  Paulie will surface, but won't quite have the high level of humor that he had during Seasons 1 to 3.  Much of Season 4 will focus on Paulie's continued friction with Tony and his relationship with the New York Crime Family.11-Bobby ""Bacala"" (played by Steven R. Schrippa) is also going to have an expanded role.  Bobby is going to go through personal hard ache with his family and eventually get involved with Janice Soprano.Here are some other points to consider from Season 4:- As mentioned, the Season finale ranks among the show's best.  Gandolfini and Falco give awesome performances in that finale.- The episode involving Christopher Columbus and whether he is a hero or not is one of the best.  It shows why this show is one of the most innovative ones on television.- Next to the Finale and Columbus episode, the other episode that is ""can't miss"" is the episode in which Ralphie's son is injured.- The music of the Sopranos continues to be a major part of the show.  This season is no exception as the music is terrific.As for the DVD packaging - besides the usual extras, one thing I really liked was how there was a brief textual synopsis provided on the screen before playing the episode.  Overall, I do think this was the best season of the show to date. Clearly the show continues to maintain its status as a ""television event"".  This show is a must-see for Sopranos fans.  New fans will also enjoy it, but should see the first three seasons first.",5,Back and better than ever,1151712000,"07 1, 2006",2006,5726,"['time', 'Sopranos', 'entered', 'fourth', 'season', 'had',

746556,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00008PW1F,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 8]","While watching the fourth season of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; it occurred to me that one of the defining moments in the history of the series was when Dr. Malfi was attacked and we waited for her to break down and tell Tony so that her assailant would disappear.  But she refuses to do it, even though it would be so easy to do.  All throughout the fourth season of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; there are several things that we are convinced that are going to happen that do not happen.  Of course, the other broad clue that this was going to become a key element of the show was when Ralph made it all the way through the third season.  We should have known that his ticket getting punched was going to be a surprise, even if it was a long anticipated event.The original tagline of the HBO series was that if one family did not get him, the other one would, and that is especially true in the fourth season, although in different ways from the first.  The bonds of fidelity are tested in these episodes as the decision to promote Ralph instead of whacking him creates cracks in the Soprano family that are exploited by both outsider and, rather surprisingly, insiders as well.  As Tony makes a concerted effort to bond with Christopher as his true blood heir, Christopher's relationship with Adriana is tested as well.  Meanwhile, with Meadow away at college and Anthony, Jr. off doing whatever, Carmella has a lot more time to think about things...and people, while Tony actually stops going to see his shrink (too soon, of course, as it turns out).The open-ended format of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; is clearly the approach that the series is taking.  If you are expecting everything from the third season that you wanted to see wrapped up handled during this one, you are going to be disappointed.  One of the reasons this was such a strong season was that they kept throwing new items into the mix, and even with the bombshell dropped in the final episode you can really have no expectations for what will happen in the fifth season, set to premier Sunday, March 7th, 2004.  The fourth season was not particularly bloody, with only seven bodies, but a couple were fairly significant and there were also a couple of significant animals that you could add to the body count if you wanted to.

Regardless, the twists and turns involving Ralphie's new race horse Pie O' My, Chris' decent into heroin addiction, Carmela's attraction to one of her husband's deadly henchmen, Johnny Sack's love for his very heavy wife, and Tony's sometimes impulsive womanizing all pay off in wonderful & unexpeted ways.The 5th season is eagerly awaited, to be sure.

Every few episides a new family member will either turn and start working for the Feds, or will become disenchanted and threaten to betray Tony.  Tony can't control his temper.  Get it?  No?  Then, we will have to watch him lose his temper every few minutes to prove it.  Did I mention it gets repetitive?  Tony threatens his own marriage, which he clearly values, by cheating on his wife every chance he gets because he's self-destructive.  The same stupid neurotic type each time.  Because -- they're like his mother.  Get it?  No.  Then, we'll repeat it until you're sick of it.  Tony is a hypocrite, screwing a partner's girlfriend while beating another associate for dating one of Tony's old girlfriends -- even after Tony gives his blessing.  Because Tony can't control his temper.  It's been a few minutes since the last pathetic rage, we needed to be reminded.  Tony can't control his temper.  Remember?

They just repeat, repeat, repeat what worked in the first three seasons until you're sick of it.  If it is funny to see a Mob Guy get offended and exact bloody revenge because of some stupid little off-hand joke, why not repeat this plot device over and over?  They're supposed to be tough, but they're REALLY thin-skinned, get it?  No?  Then, we'll just keep repeating the gag until you do.  And Ralph is just Richie Aprile.  EVERYTHING repeats until you're sick of everybody.

Too many beloved TV shows rely on the comfortable patterns of the past to maintain their popularity, and only when threatened with cancellation will they try to break out of their rut, and usually with less-than-stellar results.""The Sopranos,"" on the other hand, has no ruts because it is always changing.  Characters are killed off with aplomb, other characters are the focus of an episode or two and then fade off into the margins for five or six weeks.  Nothing is safe, and no pattern exists that can't be broken.The lodestone for Season Four remains Tony, that hulking brute of a teddy bear.  Tony continues to struggle with his bizarre duality - he is a nice guy, capable of tenderness and affection, and yet by his own omission is the scorpion who stings the frog.  The writers throw all kinds of curveballs at Tony this year, from new mistresses to Chris's drug addiction to a beloved racehorse to Tony's fatigue with Dr. Melfi's therapy to a face-off with Ralph to a face-off with Carmine and the New York families (and there's more).  Tony, who is no Superman, faces all of it head-on, with a twinkle in his eye and a murderous rage kept just under a boil.Mercifully, the writers have given us a huge cast of supporting characters worthy of Tony, and many of their plights are just as dire as Tony's.  Adriana must juggle her devotion to Chris with the intrusion of the FBI into her life.  Furio has to cope with his unrequited love for Carmela (and vice versa).  Meadow struggles with the independence of college and finally seeing her parents as human beings rather than ATM/authority figures.  Paulie struggles with being passed over in favor for Chris, and Sil needs to show Tony that he's worthy of some respect, too.  And then there's poor Bobby Bacala, who loses his beloved wife only to find the ultimate, user, Janice, ready to sink her claws into him.Wonderful acting and writing keeps ""The Sopranos"" at the highest level, and the domestic-oriented Season Four never flags even though the body count may not be as high as previous seasons.You absolutely cannot dive into Season Four without knowing what came before.

However that didn't stop this season from delivering masterpieces of confrontations and back stabbing. In this season Tony Soprano's relationship with his wife starts to take a turn for the worse, his business associates are starting to work behind his back, and then to top it all off someone may be talking to the feds...This season comes with the usual 13 episodes, including:For All Debts Public and Private: A slowing economy is affecting business, and the Sopranos are finding money a little tight nowadays, and Carmela [Tony's wife] is starting to worry about insurance issues. Adriana has made a new friend, who doesn't really get along with Adriana's fianc&eacute;, Christopher. Meanwhile Paulie is behind bars on a gun rap, and he starts finding resentment toward Tony. And finally Christopher sets his sights on avenging an old murder.No-Show: With Paulie behind bars, Christopher is put in charge of Paulie's turf. Meadow [Tony and Carmela's daughter] decides to take a year off from college to go to Europe, much to the objection of her parents. A construction site is starting to become a hotbed of criminal activity, and Tony has harsh words for his sister Janice's new relationship with Ralph, a made guy.Christopher: Tony's uncle, Uncle Junior, is on trial for his life. Silvio and Furio intend to make sure a Native American protest does not stop the Columbus Day Parade as their pride sets in. Bobby Bacala suffers a loss that affects everyone in the family, especially Janice. Paulie starts talking to Johnny Sack, a New York crime boss, which includes several eyebrow raising topics. Tony also starts to wonder whether or not someone is talking too much.The Weight: After someone makes a joke about Johnny Sack's wife at a dinner party, Johnny Sack goes on a rampage of words and threats. When the fighting of words and actions gets out of control, something must be done. Christopher and Silvio go on search for someone to take a hit, and it leads them to a group of men who seem past their prime, but are as deadly as ever. Carmela and Furio start a close relationship, and finally Meadow decides to volunteer to work at the South Bronx Law Center.Pie Oh My: Tony starts taking an interest in a race horse that Ralph bought, and still has to deal with Carmela's insistence of investing in medical stocks. Adriana finds that the club Christopher gave her is now being used by Tony and his crew for ""business"" reasons. Meanwhile Uncle Junior is still in trial and now faces insult to injury when it comes to the court artist. Janice also reaches out to Junior's helper Bobby in his time of need.Everybody Hurts: Artie, Tony's friend who owns a restaurant, finds that his new hostess is seductive enough to convince him to borrow money from Tony and give to her brother as a loan. However the brother can't pay the money back and now Artie is in debt to Tony. Christopher meanwhile has been given a lot more power in the family, but his drug addiction may get in the way of the responsibility he has to fulfill. Tony also hears news about his old mistress Gloria that sends him in a rage to Dr. Melfi.Watching Too Much Television: Paulie finally gets out of jail and a party is held to welcome him back, however he still holds a couple of grudges, especially if it concerns his mother. Johnny Sack seems to be the only person who understands Paulie, so the two start talking. Carmela's cousin Brian, who is a financial advisor, tells Tony of a ""hypothetical"" housing scheme that would bring in a lot of money.Mergers and Acquisitions: Tony has a lot more time on his hands now that he has Christopher running things for him. Ralph introduces Tony to his new girlfriend, Valentina, who is an art dealer. Paulie also gets his mom to go into the Green Grove nursing program, but is shocked when he sees how the other retirees treat his mom. Furio is in Italy and realizes a new revelation in his life and Carmela finds something really important in her own backyard...Whoever Did This: Uncle Junior's case seems to be getting worse and worse, that is until an incident on the courtroom steps outside leads to an all new defense strategy. Meanwhile Ralph has some fun with Paulie's mother, and that only adds fuel to the fire that Paulie has been brewing for a while. However things take a turn for the worse for Ralph after his son is involved in an accident. [Really big twist in this episode!]The Strong Silent Type: Tony and his crew are trying to find Ralph, who has mysteriously disappeared. Furio is back from Italy and is struggling to suppress his feelings for Carmela, who is struggling with feelings of her own. And finally Christopher's drug addiction is turning worse and worse, with Adrianna's pet dog the newest victim.Calling All Cars: After a series of dreams follow Tony all through the night he now has to talk to Johnny Sack and another mob boss, Carmine, to contemplate the future of his new property business. Meanwhile Johnny Sack and Paulie are talking about Paulie's new loyalty to the New York crew. Janice is trying to move in on Bobby and his family, and AJ [Tony's son] gets on everyone's bad side after playing a mean trick on Bobby's kids. And finally Tony surprises Dr. Melfi after saying he doesn't want to be in therapy anymore.Eloise: Tony continues to butt heads with Johnny Sack and Carmine who want in on the profit that Tony will get with his new housing scheme. Furio and Carmela continue their suppressed feelings relationship and Furio finds himself in the awkward position where he and Tony are out on the town with several ladies. Meanwhile everyone starts questioning Paulie's loyalty, but harsh reality hits Paulie when he gets to talk to Carmine. Meanwhile Carmela and Meadow start yet another argument.Whitecaps: Tony buys a beachfront summer resort to calm down all the hassles in his family right now. It almost works until Carmela gets a call from someone in Tony's past that changes everything...Johnny Sack proposes a power play that relies on Tony's cooperation, and Tony needs Christopher now more than ever. The season also ends up in the air in a dramatic way as Tony deals with hassles in his family and his crew.The fourth season of The Sopranos I thought was not a disappointment. The violence and killing is toned down a bit, but there are still twists in this season as well, especially in the ending. Plus James Gandolfini still does a wonderful job as Tony Soprano. The acting is superb, the drama is intense, and this is one season you should definitely get if you are a fan of The Sopranos...",5,The Sopranos fourth season contines the story of Tony

746589,A1DQZBHEU98PBT,B00008PW1F,Theresa W,"[0, 0]","In the Sopranos Season 4, we see a bit of a shake up on many levels.  We see trust damaged, we see human frailty, we see what happens when someone hits their breaking point, we see some good things come to an end and a beginning for other things to come.  We see a series smack in the middle of their prime, and you wonder, where will it go from here?Again, I have to say that it still surprises me that a show like this, can capture such a huge audience, even a fan like myself (who is not normally into this sort of thing).  But it shouldn't be shocking, not when you have such a large outstanding cast and creative and gifted writers like this show does.  And why is it so huge?  Because this show does what many can't- and that's to be about more than one or two central premises.  The Sopranos is about a lot of things, one of which is organized crime.  But even more it's about family, friendships, morals, inner turmoil.  I think it's the characters struggles that we relate to the most.  Well, but don't get me wrong, we all enjoy the excitement of the family business as well!  That's what we can't look away from, that's where we inhale a breath and hold it, wondering what's going to happen next.Buy it, rent it, borrow it, whatever you have to do, just do it.

There was so much complaining done about it. I liked it alot actually and found that some of the most memorable things came out of it. I think this furthered the characters and plot line a great deal- to completion for some of them. I only had one gripe and I will not spoil it for anybody who is going to just watch the dvds and hasn't seen them on HBO Already. A certain character who I happen to be entertained very much by committed an act that I thought was even out of character and out of the question for his character who is a killer and a thief already. It bugged me alot. Yes I know Mr. Chase wants everybody to know for sure that even likeable mob characters are still bad mamma jammas despite the whole nobody is 100 percent bad or 100 percent good thing and what not. But still Mr. Chase what gives?

746595,A2CDMCG1Z84A51,B00008PW1F,Wanda B. Red,"[2, 2]","Whenever I get into watching the Sopranos, I find myself thinking about them all the time, as if their lives were more real and vivid than my own. It astonishes me that characters whose experience is so different from my own, basically violent ill-educated thugs and their dames, can be given such humanity. I think the fascination comes from the contrast between the criminal underside of the Soprano family and the comfortable domesticity of their life in the suburbs, where (for example, in this season) they confront such ordinary problems as their daughter's first apartment and the tiny rift caused by the sophistication of her Columbia education.No episode exemplifies this dichotomy more than the shocking ninth episode ""Whoever Did This"" -- the episode that brings an end to the sordid career of the sociopathic Ralphie. I don't want to ruin this one for a viewer who has not watched the season, but suffice it to say that Tony's contradictions are here on full display; never is he more violent, or in a more sentimental cause. For sure, Tony is evil (Ralph's head in a bag proves it). But he's still human enough for us to believe that someone like Carmela and his children can legitimately love and care about him. What a trick these writers have!The fourth season is my favorite because it is the season where this tension between domestic comfort and violence is the most dramatic, and not only in the ninth episode. This is really Tony's and Carmela's season, as the secrets deepen and  their lives begin to veer apart hopelessly, the season when the tension becomes too much until it erupts when Carmela confronts Tony with evidence of his infidelity.

746596,A17JVVAKWEB0M,B00008PW1F,Wesley Mullins,"[4, 5]","Above all other seasons, the forth in this groundbreaking series focuses on the complex enigma that is Tony Soprano. Creator David Chase allows Gandolfini's character to go places rarely reached in television or film. Traveling through these thirteen episodes with Tony, a viewer will get to experience utter joy, limitless rage, and the unequaled pain that accompanies an acknowledgment of personal culpability in creating one's troubles.Tony comes to realize how others truly see him in the early episodes of Season Four. He laughs at his friend Artie and his cronious cohort Councilman Zellman when they nervously try to discuss different requests. He does not understand why they should be so afraid. But soon, he validates their concerns and sees the monster inside that drives away the closest people in his life.His marriage is also falling apart, a plotline most associated with this season. Gandolfini and Falco provide career performances, particularly in the finale's blow-up scene. But Tony's most powerful moments concern two important losses in his life. Sudden news of the passing of an old acquaintance sends an unstable (and violent) Tony back to therapy and another tender relationship with an animal (remember the ducks) ends with Tony out looking for blood.Chase loves to allow small incidental moments to provide the genesis for much of the show's conflict, a comment on the fragile nature of life. In the first season, the jokes about Junior's acquired &quot;taste&quot; of his girlfriend drive the wedge between he and Tony that causes many to get whacked. In this season, a throw-away line made about the weight of a tangential character builds and festers animosity all season.
