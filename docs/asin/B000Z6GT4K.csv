1121355,A3IIBE4D1VECWC,B000Z6GT4K,D. Allen,"[3, 5]","I can't wait for the Fourth Season! I had a great time watching the first three and the last seasons.Funny to say that the fourth season will be no different than any of the other seaons. One of the following three things will happen in each episode - but with different locales and settings:1) Alex gets kidnapped by some crazed con or ex-cop.2) Walker goes on vacation or undercover and reveals a major gang operation by accident or luck.3) For little or no apparent reason, a specific criminal targets the texas ranger, and everyone on his ""hit list"" is dead except for Walker and Walker bust the criminal by doing a spectacular martial art sideshow instead of using a gun.I find Walker to be a hilarious show. When I was young, I found it to be semi-serious, but now as an adult, I can't help but laugh at some things. On one episode Walker played a con sent to a prison undercover of some hitman and the mob leader said, ""Some people eat airplane food and asks for seconds. You don't look like that kind of a man and that's why I trust you."" I was drinking some soda at that moment, and I almost sprayed it all over my laptop.It's even more funny that every single bad guy in Texas knows expert martial arts. When given a choice between a gun or fighting hand-to-hand combat, every criminal chooses hand to hand, regardless of the fact if the criminal is armed to the teeth with automatic rifles and submachine guns.Oh yeah, one episode a woman's father just gotten blown up by a grenade and probably burnt to pieces. Trivette came in trying to pick her up and they both started flirting right there next to her dad's burning car. And then she stomped off and Trivette was like, ""Gosh, women!"" Funny as anything.One thing you can always count on, every episode ends with a slow motion round house kick to the face, and then CD, Walker, Trivette, Alex, and the new new members (in later seasons) kick it off with some joke where everyone laughs and then credit rolls.",5,Preview: Fourth Season...,1203033600,"02 15, 2008",2008,1971,"['ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Fourth', 'Season', 'had', 'great', 'time', 'watching', 'first', 'three', 'last', 'seasons.Funny', 'say', 'fourth', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'different', 'other', 'seaons', 'One', 'following', 'three', 'things', 'will', 'happen', 'episode', 'different', 'locales', 'settings:1', 'Alex', 'kidnapped', 'crazed', 'con', 'ex-cop.2', 'Walker', 'vacation', 'undercover', 'major', 'gang', 'operation', 'accident', 'luck.3', 'little', 'apparent', 'reason', 'specific', 'criminal', 'targets', 'texas', 'ranger', 'everyone', 'hit', 'list', 'dead', 'Walker', 'Walker', 'bust', 'criminal', 'doing', 'spectacular', 'martial', 'art', 'sideshow', 'instead', 'using', 'gun.I', 'find', 'Walker', 'be', 'hilarious', 'show', 'When', 'was', 'young', 'found', 'be', 'semi-serious', 'now', 'adult', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'laugh', 'things', 'one', 'episode', 'Walker', 'played', 'con', 'sent', 'prison', 'undercover', 'hitman', 'mob', 'leader', 'said', 'people', 'eat', 'airplane', 'food', 'asks', 'seconds', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'kind', 'man', 'why', 'trust', 'was', 'drinking', 'soda', 'moment', 'almost', 'sprayed', 'laptop.It', 'even', 'more', 'funny', 'single', 'bad', 'guy', 'Texas', 'expert', 'martial', 'arts', 'When', 'given', 'choice', 'gun', 'fighting', 'hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'criminal', 'hand', 'hand', 'regardless', 'fact', 'criminal', 'armed', 'teeth', 'automatic', 'rifles', 'submachine', 'guns.Oh', 'yeah', 'one', 'episode', 'woman', 'father', 'just', 'gotten', 'blown', 'up', 'grenade', 'probably', 'burnt', 'pieces', 'Trivette', 'came', 'trying', 'pick', 'up', 'started', 'flirting', 'right', 'there', 'next', 'dad', 'burning', 'car', 'then', 'stomped', 'off', 'Trivette', 'was', 'Gosh', 'women', 'Funny', 'anything.One', 'thing', 'can', 'always', 'count', 'episode', 'slow', 'motion', 'round', 'house', 'kick', 'face', 'then', 'CD', 'Walker', 'Trivette', 'Alex', 'new', 'new', 'members', 'later', 'seasons', 'kick', 'off', 'joke', 'where', 'everyone', 'then', 'credit', 'rolls']","Walker, Texas Ranger: Season 4"

In fact when they first started showing Walker on CBS that is when I started being a fan of Chuck Norris. When I first started buying Walker Texas Ranger I was really looking forward to owning all of the seasons on dvd! I do not regret purchasing any of them on dvd. If I had to I would buy them all over again that is how good the show is (at least it is to me). I definitely recommend the fourth season for any Walker fan. This one had a lot of action and just has great episodes of Walker Texas Ranger! Chuck Norris did an excellent job in his portrayal of his character Cordell Walker. They could not have picked a better actor for Walker. This show has an excellent cast in it. I liked all of the characters in it and the actors in it.The production did an excellent job picking out the actors and actresses in the show! I have to admit I could not remember what episodes belonged to what season til I purchased them on dvd. I remembered some but not all I am glad that I have them on dvd because the picture quality is a whole lot better than the vhs tapes that I used to record the episodes on so I could watch them again.

1121369,A2NC9G399V3UF0,B000Z6GT4K,"Tim Lasiuta ""Comic Fan 42""","[12, 14]","One of the highlights of my DVD collection is the Walker, Texas Ranger series. As a fan of old TV western films that starring Gene Autry, John, Wayne, Clayton Moore, Gary Cooper, and Jimmy Stewart, ""Walker"" hit the genre dead on without being western.The fourth season of Walker continues the grand tradition of adventure, and moralistic adventures. Ranger Cordel Walker, Jimmy Trivette, and Assistant DA Alex Cahill tackle crime in the Dallas area. With Walker and his half Cherokee background, you just never know what kind of case (or evidence) comes up. ""Ghost Rider"" includes a mystic vision that leads Walker to the murderer in an 8 year old cold case. Eastern mysticism comes to the forefront in ""Higher Power"" as Walker protects a chosen one until his return to the monastery. Alex Cahill faces her father in court in ""Redemption"", and discovers how thick blood really is. Cordel Walker plays ""Christmas Carol"" to a group of orphans in a touching episode ""A Ranger's Christmas"". A hit man comes to town in ""The Deadliest Man Alive"" and Interpol collaborates with Walker to take him out. The supernatural re-enters Dallas in ""Heart of the Dragon"" as Walker restores a jade idol to it's proper owner.My favorite (hard to pick) episode this season is probably the two part ""Sons of Thunder"" that introduces Trent Molloy to the outstanding cast of characters. Episodes like this are the reason why the show lasted 8 seasons, and could probably have lasted beyond Bonanzas' 12 years on the air.The outstanding artwork that graces the inside of the disc cases of Walker beside his horse just cement the relationship between Walker and classic westerns.You can't lose with Walker.Www.paramount.com/homeentertainmentTim Lasiuta",5,Walker Spectacular!,1202083200,"02 4, 2008",2008,1727,"['One', 'highlights', 'DVD', 'collection', 'Walker', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'series', 'fan', 'old', 'TV', 'western', 'films', 'starring', 'Gene', 'Autry', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Clayton', 'Moore', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Walker', 'hit', 'genre', 'dead', 'being', 'western.The', 'fourth', 'season', 'Walker', 'grand', 'tradition', 'adventure', 'moralistic', 'adventures', 'Ranger', 'Cordel', 'Walker', 'Jimmy', 'Trivette', 'Assistant', 'DA', 'Alex', 'Cahill', 'tackle', 'crime', 'Dallas', 'area', 'Walker', 'half', 'Cherokee', 'background', 'just', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'case', 'evidence', 'up', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'mystic', 'vision', 'Walker', 'murderer', '8', 'year', 'old', 'cold', 'case', 'Eastern', 'mysticism', 'forefront', 'Higher', 'Power', 'Walker', 'chosen', 'one', 'return', 'monastery', 'Alex', 'Cahill', 'father', 'court', 'Redemption', 'how', 'thick', 'blood', 'really', 'Cordel', 'Walker', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'group', 'orphans', 'touching', 'episode', 'A', 'Ranger', 'Christmas', 'hit', 'man', 'town', 'Deadliest', 'Man', 'Alive', 'Interpol', 'Walker', 'take', 'out', 'supernatural', 're-enters', 'Dallas', 'Heart', 'Dragon', 'Walker', 'jade', 'idol', 'proper', 'owner.My', 'favorite', 'hard', 'pick', 'episode', 'season', 'probably', 'two', 'part', 'Sons', 'Thunder', 'Trent', 'Molloy', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'characters', 'Episodes', 'are', 'reason', 'why', 'show', 'lasted', '8', 'seasons', 'could', 'probably', 'have', 'lasted', 'Bonanzas', '12', 'years', 'air.The', 'outstanding', 'artwork', 'inside', 'disc', 'cases', 'Walker', 'horse', 'just', 'cement', 'relationship', 'Walker', 'classic', 'westerns.You', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lose', 'Walker.Www.paramount.com/homeentertainmentTim', 'Lasiuta']","Walker, Texas Ranger: Season 4"
