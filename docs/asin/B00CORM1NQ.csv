1649763,A3RXJYWBLOKP4O,B00CORM1NQ,Irene Gierzak,"[1, 1]","When I watch an episode of the show, I can't wait until I can purchase the dvd. There are so many parts to each character that you can watch these over and over and still find out something different about each character. I really like it when they are involved with people other than Swedish, it makes you realize how close the other countries are and makes you wonder what it would be like in the states if we each spoke different languages and had different law systems in place. I know it is true that the people there can speak other languages, but they also have to understand them and where they are from. This show does a great job in showing that this is just a way of life there and treating everyone's problems or crimes the same. I really hope there will be more episodes because these characters are too good to not make more and the stories are always top notch. PS I have all the dvds and watch them over and over and still enjoy them very much.",5,More Beck Please,1379030400,"09 13, 2013",2013,960,"['When', 'watch', 'episode', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'can', 'purchase', 'dvd', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'parts', 'character', 'can', 'watch', 'still', 'find', 'out', 'something', 'different', 'character', 'really', 'when', 'are', 'involved', 'people', 'other', 'Swedish', 'realize', 'how', 'close', 'other', 'countries', 'are', 'wonder', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'states', 'spoke', 'different', 'languages', 'had', 'different', 'law', 'systems', 'place', 'know', 'true', 'people', 'can', 'speak', 'other', 'languages', 'also', 'have', 'understand', 'where', 'are', 'show', 'great', 'job', 'showing', 'just', 'way', 'life', 'treating', 'everyone', 'problems', 'same', 'really', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'episodes', 'characters', 'are', 'too', 'good', 'not', 'make', 'more', 'stories', 'are', 'always', 'top', 'notch', 'PS', 'have', 'dvds', 'watch', 'over', 'over', 'still', 'enjoy', 'very', 'much']",Beck: Episodes 22-24

I ordered the 19-21 episodes, hoping to catch the final seasons, but, while the first two were new to me (though it was clear they appeared earlier in the line-up) the third is The Japanese Painting, which I've seen twice (due to it's having been cleverly inserted into another 'new' season); it's one of the best, but I really don't want to see it again.This series is among the best available. But the dvd mixers and sellers do a disservice in palming off duplicates of episodes they've already sold us in the past. Watch and read the titles before you buy.",1,Repeats.
