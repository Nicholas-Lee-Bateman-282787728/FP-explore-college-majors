The original author did not write the first half which consists of three episodes.  Most people I know even deny the existance of the first half.  The second half is much better!  I don't want to spoil anything for anyone who has not seen it but believe me, it is fantastic. You see a lot of new characters and one's mentioned in the series.  The animation and music is really nice.  Plus, between every episode there is a hysterical 'super deformed' skit involving the Suzaku and the Seiryu and a lot of inside jokes for Fushigi Yugi fans.  I highly suggest this and the series.

579942,A1TKCUJFJ8MPC,B00005B1ZO,Anastasia,"[1, 1]","This OVA was all about tying up loose ends.We all wanted to know how Miaka was able to see Tamahome again.  We wanted to know what happened to the rest of the Suzaku warriors (the living ones, anyway; because at the time, the dead didn't have anything going on, except for appearing to give guidance to the living and an ending to their story).  We wanted to know what happened to Miaka, Keisuke, Yui, and Tetsuya.  We wanted to know what happened to the surviving Seiryu warrior.  We definitely wanted to know what happened to the Universe of the Four Gods.Well, my questions were answered...somewhat. Tamahome (aka Taka Sukunami) doubted who he was so much that he didn't believe who he was anymore, and then almost drank himself to death in the first attempt at disillusionment.  I ended up liking him a lot less in the OVA than I did in the cartoon series.  That was the only dislike I had in the whole OVA.  That was the big disappointment to me, though his personality did a 360 during the cartoon series.Other than that, because of Yui's vindictive jealousy (that was inevitably exploited by Nakago), she remains caught in a state of utter self-doubt and was stripped of all of her warriors.  It also shows how their friendship changed, as well as themselves.  Miaka isn't so immature; Yui isn't so proud--or jealous.  Or vindictive.  Or in other words, a bitch.  Tetsuya loves Yui as is, and I'm happy for her, though Keisuke should've had a girlfriend too!If you like the cartoon series (and watched them all), this just shows them who they are a year later.  If you had some questions, and the ending didn't do you any justice (even if you did cry at the very end), this will answer them--only in the Mysterious Play way.  I can't give everything away (though I pretty much did at this point)!

579944,A2V026TK7H80V3,B00005B1ZO,Carl Cheng,"[30, 32]","This final DVD set for Watase Yu's famous anime series, Fushigi Yuugi, contains the 2 OAVs that were released.  The first OAV has 3 episodes which concerns itself about how Tamahome couldn't stay in the real world as his current form while a new evil comes out of NOWHERE.  The second OAV has 6 episodes which are about the new evil returning and just tying up loose ends.  This brings the series to a finish.  Personally, the OAVs did not give me the same effect that I got from the TV series.  The stories in the OAVs seemed random and so out of place.  Because they were so random, when they got to the real story at hand, it felt way too rushed.The animation is updated from the TV series.  Because Miaka and the others are older, they retain a new, mature look.  I think the OAVs in general are for a more older audience.  There is some nudity that is actually more detailed than in the TV series.The music gives the same feel but obviously with a more darker mood.  Most of the songs are sung by Akemi Sato (who sang the opening to the TV series).  Songs are nice, different ones for each OAV.Accompanied with the OAV series are these fun little sigments.  For the first OAV, there's a trip to a hot spring that only girls are allowed to enter.  So you can see all the *cough* fun they have there.  The second OAVs have these outtakes of the episodes that are extremely weird and random.Final Note:  While the FY TV series ended well in my opinion, this basically just concludes it even more I guess.  Price might seem a little steep for just 9 episodes.  But then again, it's good quality, it's Pioneer, it's Fushigi Yuugi!  Even though the OAV series wasn't too good, it is definately worth watching.  And if you bought the DVD box sets (Suzaku and Seiryu for the TV series), you'll probably want this to finish off the collection.",4,What?

It is true that the box sets are expensive somehow but it is worth it. Now I can say that I watched the 52 TV series episodes, 9 OVA series and the Eikoden and they are all excellent. I thought that Ayashi No Ceres is the best, but I was wrong and I found out that Fushigi Yugi is far more better than ceres. Yu Watase is one of the best anime creators and I can't wait till they make Alice 19th a TV series. Anyway, this OVA Boxed Set is a masterpiece. I especially love the Ending Theme of the first two episodes. To tell you the truth, I missed Nakago and Hotohori. It is true that they appeared in the episodes, but they were no more than phantoms or ghosts, so it wasn't that effective. I agree with Ms.Watase that Nakago is one of the best characters and he is one of my favourites too along with Hotohori. I was hoping that Miaka will end up with Hotohori somehow but it didn't happen. It is not that I don't like Taka aka Tamahome, but I think that he is better off with Yui. I liked Yui far more than Miaka and she became a beautiful lady too. I think she and Tetsia can make a good couple. Tasake is a good character and an attractive one too. What can I say more? All I can say is that I will miss this anime and I will always remember it. I'm trying to read the manga now, so I placed an order for the first volume. It is my first time that I ever read a manga. I usually watch the series directly, so I don't find it necessary to read the manga, but I will read Fushigi Yugi. I want to thank Yu Watase for such a great project and the Director for such a good work. I also extended my thanks to Amazon.com for always providing us with such excellent animes for if it weren't for Amazon.com, I don't know what I was going to do. To all of animes freak, watch this one and never miss it. Be sure that you won't regret it.Was this review helpful to you?

579947,A3IOL528UTH7IL,B00005B1ZO,J. A. Stickles,"[15, 16]","I can't help but write reviews on the Fushigi Yugi series, it is my favorite, as you can tell if you read my previous two reviews.  The Fushigi Yugi OAV continues with excellence in this nine episode continuation.  And as a reminder, the OAV's are far more dramatic then the series, a reason why there are omake theatre sequences at the end, so hopefully you won't be too depressed at the end...didn't work for me though.  For other fans of the series, we all know it's a tear jerker, but I'll get into that later.For fans of the series, you will probably most definitely agree that the OAV is very heavy on the heart, and the one reason that I am so passionate about this show.  The OAV is broken up into two ""parts.""  The first three episodes of the series will definitely make you confused as all hell, but thankfully it's explained by the third episode.  If you are a fan of Tamahome and Miaka, be ready to tear up, if you are truly into the series, you won't help but tear up.Thankfully, all of the Suzaku Seven return, in one form or the other.  And again, they have to be reassembled, and finding the spirits is a little more tuff.  And there's a new cast of villains in the OAV.  Tomo, who isn't as great as Nakago, is the psychotic leader of the ""evil"" side, and his group of evil comrads don't come close to the original Seryiu Seven.  You'll miss Nakago for sure.As I stated before, the first three episodes are tear jerkers, but wait until you see episode four.  It is for lack of a better word, gut-renching.  I even know guys who were torn up over that episode.  Don't get me wrong, there are some other light moments, but it is pretty emotional.  The other episodes that follow continue with the same route.  You grow to love the characters more and more, for they have all grown so much as individuals.Miaka for one thing, will not annoy you as much, promise.  She has evolved into a smart, less gluttoness, and stronger person.  She does depend on Tamahome, but can you blame her, they spent all that time trying to protect the world, and protect eachother, and just because the first part of the series is over, don't be stupid to think the dependency is over with.  There's also an interesting twist about Tamahome, which you will either love, or absolutely hate, I haven't seen too much of a middle ground.Nuriko is back, and wiser and still the best friend of Miaka, but he grows even closer with Tamahome's character, and is one of most positive characters in the OAV.  Tasuki is still the comedic relief, while Chichiri has an episode that actually revolves around him and his past, which you did not see during the regular series.  It is quite refreshing.  Hotohori is still a bit whiney, but I still love him...and it's obvious that he's over Miaka, thankfully.Like I've said, this series is something I can talk hours about, which is why I can rarely say anything ""bad"" about it.  You'll love the OAV if you loved the series, it is thoughtfully made and devised.  Yu Watase us a goddess when it comes to certain aspects of manga/anime, she has a talent for drama, and great characters.  Too much to say, but I highly reccomend this to any FY fan, and/ or anime fan.",5,Tear Jerker,1050451200,"04 16, 2003",2003,3191,"['ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'write', 'reviews', 'Fushigi', 'Yugi', 'series', 'favorite', 'can', 'tell', 'read', 'previous', 'two', 'reviews', 'Fushigi', 'Yugi', 'OAV', 'excellence', 'nine', 'episode', 'continuation', 'reminder', 'OAV', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'dramatic', 'then', 'series', 'reason', 'why', 'are', 'omake', 'theatre', 'sequences', 'end', 'so', 'hopefully', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'depressed', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'other', 'fans', 'series', 'know', 'tear', 'jerker', ""'ll"", 'get', 'later.For', 'fans', 'series', 'will', 'probably', 'most', 'definitely', 'agree', 'OAV', 'very', 'heavy', 'heart', 'one', 'reason', 'am', 'so', 'passionate', 'show', 'OAV', 'broken', 'up', 'two', 'parts', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'series', 'will', 'definitely', 'make', 'confused', 'hell', 'thankfully', 'explained', 'third', 'episode', 'are', 'fan', 'Tamahome', 'Miaka', 'be', 'ready', 'tear', 'up', 'are', 'truly', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'help', 'tear', 'up.Thankfully', 'Suzaku', 'Seven', 'return', 'one', 'form', 'other', 'again', 'have', 'be', 'reassembled', 'finding', 'spirits', 'little', 'more', 'tuff', 'new', 'cast', 'villains', 'OAV', 'Tomo', 'who', ""n't"", 'as', 'great', 'Nakago', 'psychotic', 'leader', 'evil', 'side', 'group', 'evil', 'comrads', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'original', 'Seryiu', 'Seven', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'Nakago', 'sure.As', 'stated', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'are', 'tear', 'jerkers', 'wait', 'see', 'episode', 'four', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'gut-renching', 'even', 'know', 'guys', 'who', 'were', 'torn', 'up', 'episode', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'are', 'other', 'light', 'moments', 'pretty', 'emotional', 'other', 'episodes', 'follow', 'continue', 'same', 'route', 'grow', 'love', 'characters', 'more', 'more', 'have', 'grown', 'so', 'much', 'individuals.Miaka', 'one', 'thing', 'will', 'not', 'annoy', 'much', 'promise', 'evolved', 'smart', 'less', 'gluttoness', 'stronger', 'person', 'depend', 'Tamahome', 'can', 'blame', 'spent', 'time', 'trying', 'protect', 'world', 'protect', 'eachother', 'just', 'first', 'part', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'stupid', 'think', 'dependency', 'also', 'interesting', 'twist', 'Tamahome', 'will', 'either', 'love', 'absolutely', 'hate', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'too', 'much', 'middle', 'ground.Nuriko', 'back', 'wiser', 'still', 'best', 'friend', 'Miaka', 'even', 'closer', 'Tamahome', 'character', 'one', 'most', 'positive', 'characters', 'OAV', 'Tasuki', 'still', 'comedic', 'relief', 'Chichiri', 'episode', 'actually', 'past', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'regular', 'series', 'quite', 'refreshing', 'Hotohori', 'still', 'bit', 'whiney', 'still', 'love', 'obvious', 'Miaka', ""'ve"", 'said', 'series', 'something', 'can', 'talk', 'hours', 'why', 'can', 'rarely', 'say', 'anything', 'bad', ""'ll"", 'love', 'OAV', 'loved', 'series', 'thoughtfully', 'made', 'devised', 'Yu', 'Watase', 'goddess', 'when', 'certain', 'aspects', 'manga/anime', 'talent', 'drama', 'great', 'characters', 'Too', 'much', 'say', 'highly', 'reccomend', 'FY', 'fan', 'and/', 'anime', 'fan']",Fushigi Yugi - The Mysterious Play 3 - OVA
579948,A3GFK7F5IUF60X,B00005B1ZO,"Myra Schjelderup ""Ignolopi""","[1, 2]","I liked the first half of the Fushigi Yuugi series, Suzaku, very much. The second half, Seiryu, not so much.The OVAs, however, are worse than the second set. Although I didn't much care for the ending of Seiryu, it did end, and I didn't much see the point of having more.The first OVA is about some evil in the book world that they have to deal with. Beware, definitely a mature rating here, and even if the bad guy is cool, I didn't think much about the rest of the story.The second OVA takes place when Miaka is pregnant, and much older. It goes back into the book to fight against a stupid girl from Miaka's world who tries to mess things up. She's really annoying.Both OVAs you get to learn a little more about some of the characters, but really some things are better not knowing and going through. Although it was inevitable Tasuki falls for Miaka at one point, the way this happened here completely ruined his image, and my opinion of him has been hard to repair.Really, the best part of the OVAs was the in between stuff. It's this nonsense story about the two sects (Suzaku and Seiryu people) going to a hot springs. The funniest stuff happens when they're in the buses, and it's just hilarious; using the twins to write insults to the other sect, the accurate portrayal of Miaka and Tamahome ('Tamahome...' 'Miaka...' 'Tamahome...' 'Miaka...' with little flowers and sparklies...), and more. Cute.There were also some good outtakes, but also some very lame and/or embarrassing ones.The music was good, once again, and the art stayed pretty and aged the characters very well.So if you really, really loved the entire series, and are OK with a mature rating, go ahead and get these OVAs, if not only for the Hot Springs nonsense story.Otherwise, you might try D.N. Angel, Peacemaker, Knight Hunters, Fruits Basket, or a number of the other great anime titles out there.Also, if you liked the Fushigi Yuugi music, you should definitely look at getting Fushigi Yuugi Super Best Collection, and because there are so many great voice actors in the series, Memories: Character's Vocal and Fushigi Yuugi Best Vocal Collection are a must.",2,"The series is good, but....",1163548800,"11 15, 2006",2006,2139,"['liked', 'first', 'half', 'Fushigi', 'Yuugi', 'series', 'Suzaku', 'very', 'much', 'second', 'half', 'Seiryu', 'not', 'so', 'much.The', 'OVAs', 'however', 'are', 'worse', 'second', 'set', 'did', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'ending', 'Seiryu', 'did', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'much', 'see', 'point', 'having', 'more.The', 'first', 'OVA', 'evil', 'book', 'world', 'have', 'deal', 'Beware', 'definitely', 'mature', 'rating', 'here', 'even', 'bad', 'guy', 'cool', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'rest', 'story.The', 'second', 'OVA', 'place', 'when', 'Miaka', 'pregnant', 'much', 'older', 'back', 'book', 'fight', 'stupid', 'girl', 'Miaka', 'world', 'who', 'mess', 'things', 'up', 'really', 'annoying.Both', 'OVAs', 'get', 'learn', 'little', 'more', 'characters', 'really', 'things', 'are', 'better', 'not', 'knowing', 'going', 'was', 'inevitable', 'Tasuki', 'Miaka', 'one', 'point', 'way', 'happened', 'here', 'completely', 'ruined', 'image', 'opinion', 'been', 'hard', 'repair.Really', 'best', 'part', 'OVAs', 'was', 'stuff', 'nonsense', 'story', 'two', 'sects', 'Suzaku', 'Seiryu', 'people', 'going', 'hot', 'springs', 'funniest', 'stuff', 'when', ""'re"", 'buses', 'just', 'hilarious', 'using', 'twins', 'write', 'insults', 'other', 'sect', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'Miaka', 'Tamahome', ""'Miaka"", ""'Miaka"", 'little', 'flowers', 'sparklies', 'more', 'Cute.There', 'were', 'also', 'good', 'outtakes', 'also', 'very', 'lame', 'and/or', 'embarrassing', 'ones.The', 'music', 'was', 'good', 'once', 'again', 'art', 'stayed', 'pretty', 'aged', 'characters', 'very', 'well.So', 'really', 'really', 'loved', 'entire', 'series', 'are', 'OK', 'mature', 'rating', 'go', 'ahead', 'get', 'OVAs', 'not', 'only', 'Hot', 'Springs', 'nonsense', 'story.Otherwise', 'might', 'try', 'D.N', 'Angel', 'Peacemaker', 'Knight', 'Hunters', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'number', 'other', 'great', 'anime', 'titles', 'out', 'there.Also', 'liked', 'Fushigi', 'Yuugi', 'music', 'should', 'definitely', 'look', 'getting', 'Fushigi', 'Yuugi', 'Super', 'Best', 'Collection', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'voice', 'actors', 'series', 'Memories', 'Character', 'Vocal', 'Fushigi', 'Yuugi', 'Best', 'Vocal', 'Collection', 'are', 'must']",Fushigi Yugi - The Mysterious Play 3 - OVA

Having read people's reviews before, I had low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised! It is different and it can seem a bit convoluted, but if you pay close attention you will be able to find out what's going on quickly and realize where the plot is going. The ending is a bit weak, and Taka is a bit emo, but these little slights can be overlooked. Tasuki undergoes a change but that is because he realizes he has feelings for Miaka and becomes possessed by an evil spirit (he manages to exorcise it with Taka and Miaka's help). And also, alot of people will notice this part of the series is mainly about Taka recovering his memories even though Miaka is still a major part of the plot. Overall, it's still a worthy addition to your Fushigi Yugi collection (even with the minor flaws in it).",4,Not as bad as everyone said....,1232582400,"01 22, 2009",2009,910,"['bought', 'item', '1', ""'m"", 'huge', 'Fushigi', 'Yugi', 'fan', '2', 'wanted', 'see', 'was', 'as', 'bad', 'people', 'said', 'Having', 'read', 'people', 'reviews', 'had', 'low', 'expectations', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'different', 'can', 'seem', 'bit', 'convoluted', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'quickly', 'realize', 'where', 'plot', 'going', 'ending', 'bit', 'weak', 'Taka', 'bit', 'emo', 'little', 'slights', 'can', 'be', 'overlooked', 'Tasuki', 'change', 'feelings', 'Miaka', 'becomes', 'possessed', 'evil', 'spirit', 'exorcise', 'Taka', 'Miaka', 'help', 'also', 'alot', 'people', 'will', 'notice', 'part', 'series', 'mainly', 'Taka', 'recovering', 'memories', 'even', 'Miaka', 'still', 'major', 'part', 'plot', 'Overall', 'still', 'worthy', 'addition', 'Fushigi', 'Yugi', 'collection', 'even', 'minor', 'flaws']",Fushigi Yugi - The Mysterious Play 3 - OVA
