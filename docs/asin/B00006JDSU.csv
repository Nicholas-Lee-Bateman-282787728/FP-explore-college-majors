717695,A1VEJM45WNSYCY,B00006JDSU,"Amazon Customer ""the_enchanted""","[9, 9]","First of all the description.  The continuation of Fushigi Yugi-Eikoden is a story about a girl Maya who is secretly in love with Taka is enveloped in jealousy and hatred.  Her twisted emotion climaxed during Miaka and Taka's wedding.  Accidentally seeing the book-The Universe of Four Gods in a dump, she found out the past of Miaka and Tamahome and how Taka is the reincarnation of a character in a book.  She then decided to open the book again and find her own adventure and possible love.  However, the book itself has turned into hole for negative energy craving for another legend to ensure its own survival.  Maya thus become the puppet of the negative energy.  Her entering the book caused Miaka to fall into a coma.  In addition, Miaka's baby magically disappeared and somehow, Maya now carries her baby.  Desperate, Taka decides to go into the book again in order to save Miaka.  The adventure thus begins...(not like i haven't spoiled enough, but lol)It was a huge disappointment for I am a die hard Fushigi Yugi fan ever since I saw the Manga about 6 years ago.  The origanal 52 episode of this anime itself is magical as it draws me deeper and deeper into it.  However, this continuation is a disgrace for Fushigi Yugi.  It not only has a lame plot, its character designs and even voices have been changed and conducted differently.  Supposely, Eikoden so much newer than the original Fushigi Yugi, but the graphical art is extremely dull, the movement of the character is very unreal and awkward.  Eikoden completely ruins the beauty of Fushigi Yugi.  It is not worth buying even if you are a devoted fan of FY.  If you really wanna see it, rent it from somewhere.  Despite the disapointment, the opening music is quite satisfying.  Very beautiful, romantic beat.",2,Beyond Disappointment...,1074297600,"01 17, 2004",2004,1778,"['First', 'description', 'continuation', 'Fushigi', 'Yugi-Eikoden', 'story', 'girl', 'Maya', 'who', 'secretly', 'love', 'Taka', 'enveloped', 'jealousy', 'hatred', 'twisted', 'emotion', 'climaxed', 'Miaka', 'Taka', 'wedding', 'Accidentally', 'seeing', 'book-The', 'Universe', 'Four', 'Gods', 'dump', 'found', 'past', 'Miaka', 'Tamahome', 'how', 'Taka', 'reincarnation', 'character', 'book', 'then', 'decided', 'open', 'book', 'again', 'find', 'own', 'adventure', 'possible', 'love', 'However', 'book', 'turned', 'hole', 'negative', 'energy', 'craving', 'legend', 'ensure', 'own', 'survival', 'Maya', 'thus', 'become', 'puppet', 'negative', 'energy', 'entering', 'book', 'caused', 'Miaka', 'fall', 'coma', 'addition', 'Miaka', 'baby', 'magically', 'disappeared', 'somehow', 'Maya', 'now', 'baby', 'Desperate', 'Taka', 'go', 'book', 'again', 'order', 'save', 'Miaka', 'adventure', 'thus', 'not', 'i', 'have', ""n't"", 'spoiled', 'enough', 'lol', 'was', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'am', 'die', 'hard', 'Fushigi', 'Yugi', 'fan', 'ever', 'saw', 'Manga', '6', 'years', 'ago', 'origanal', '52', 'episode', 'anime', 'magical', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'However', 'continuation', 'disgrace', 'Fushigi', 'Yugi', 'not', 'only', 'lame', 'plot', 'character', 'designs', 'even', 'voices', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'conducted', 'differently', 'Supposely', 'Eikoden', 'so', 'much', 'newer', 'original', 'Fushigi', 'Yugi', 'graphical', 'art', 'extremely', 'dull', 'movement', 'character', 'very', 'unreal', 'awkward', 'Eikoden', 'completely', 'beauty', 'Fushigi', 'Yugi', 'not', 'worth', 'buying', 'even', 'are', 'devoted', 'fan', 'FY', 'really', 'wan', 'see', 'rent', 'somewhere', 'disapointment', 'opening', 'music', 'quite', 'satisfying', 'Very', 'beautiful', 'romantic', 'beat']",N/A

What could the producers possibly come up with this time?  This isn't Watase Yu's fault.  Then again, it is...a fanfic (a fictional story by a fan based on these characters on a website) was approved by Yu, and thus Eikoden begins.We see this little girl named Mayo, who's on the basketball team with her friend, Saori.  The coaches are Keisuke, and you guessed it...Taka.  Guess who she has the crush on?  Too predictable, I tell you--no need to elaborate here.  Mayo's jealousy and rage (at Taka's/Miaka's marriage) equal Yui's of old when she discovers the Universe of the Four Gods and becomes a Suzaku priestess.  Keisuke become a witness again to the book's powers as it takes Mayo inside.  Mayo wants Taka for herself, in any way that she can.  The shinzaho is Miaka's baby, and Miaka's laying in a hospital bed, helpless...or so she seems.  Enough of that.  I see the original voice of Tamahome (in the English dubbed version) got sick of this convoluted mess, and didn't want to be part of it, because it wasn't his voice that I heard.  It sounded similar, but it wasn't him.If you are a true-blue fan of Fushigi Yugi/Mysterious Play, then at least ask someone who's heard of it and ask them to lend it to you.  I got this DVD as a gift, so it sits with the rest of the FY collection...untouched.  We view it at least once in a while, but why bother?  Mayo has no redeeming virtues because we didn't know her, so we instantly hate her when she tries to separate Taka from Miaka.The good points was that we got to see the Suzaku Seven come together again (Chichiri and Tasuki are alive and well; the others reborn), though whatever kind of evil it was remained unseen (I still don't know what it was), and I won't even bother trying to find out.  All I did was say, ""WTF?"" and scratched my head, trying to figure it out, and eventually gave up.  Also loved the music (which I downloaded).All in all, try your best to go to a website and read the story, if I were you.  You'd waste money trying to buy something like this.  The OVA was the end of FY; don't try to resurrect it with some bull like this.",1,"A Waste of Paper, Color, and Story",1119744000,"06 26, 2005",2005,2233,"['Ah', 'get', 'see', 'lovely', 'Miaka', 'Taka', 'again', '2-3', 'years', 'later', ""'re"", 'married', 'Miaka', 'pregnant', 'Wow', 'Great', 'What', 'could', 'producers', 'possibly', 'come', 'up', 'time', ""n't"", 'Watase', 'Yu', 'fault', 'Then', 'again', 'fanfic', 'fictional', 'story', 'fan', 'based', 'characters', 'website', 'was', 'approved', 'Yu', 'thus', 'Eikoden', 'begins.We', 'see', 'little', 'girl', 'named', 'Mayo', 'who', 'basketball', 'team', 'friend', 'Saori', 'coaches', 'are', 'Keisuke', 'guessed', 'Taka', 'Guess', 'who', 'crush', 'Too', 'predictable', 'tell', 'need', 'elaborate', 'here', 'Mayo', 'jealousy', 'rage', ""Taka's/Miaka"", 'marriage', 'equal', 'Yui', 'old', 'when', 'Universe', 'Four', 'Gods', 'Suzaku', 'priestess', 'Keisuke', 'become', 'witness', 'again', 'book', 'powers', 'Mayo', 'inside', 'Mayo', 'Taka', 'herself', 'way', 'can', 'shinzaho', 'Miaka', 'baby', 'Miaka', 'laying', 'hospital', 'bed', 'helpless', 'so', 'Enough', 'see', 'original', 'voice', 'Tamahome', 'English', 'dubbed', 'version', 'got', 'sick', 'convoluted', 'mess', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'part', 'was', ""n't"", 'voice', 'heard', 'sounded', 'similar', 'was', ""n't"", 'him.If', 'are', 'true-blue', 'fan', 'Fushigi', 'Yugi/Mysterious', 'Play', 'then', 'least', 'ask', 'someone', 'who', 'heard', 'ask', 'lend', 'got', 'DVD', 'gift', 'rest', 'FY', 'collection', 'untouched', 'view', 'least', 'once', 'while', 'why', 'bother', 'Mayo', 'redeeming', 'virtues', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'instantly', 'hate', 'when', 'separate', 'Taka', 'Miaka.The', 'good', 'points', 'was', 'got', 'see', 'Suzaku', 'Seven', 'come', 'together', 'again', 'Chichiri', 'Tasuki', 'are', 'alive', 'well', 'others', 'reborn', 'though', 'kind', 'evil', 'was', 'remained', 'unseen', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'did', 'was', 'say', 'WTF', 'scratched', 'head', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'eventually', 'gave', 'up', 'Also', 'loved', 'music', 'downloaded', '.All', 'try', 'best', 'go', 'website', 'read', 'story', 'were', ""'d"", 'waste', 'money', 'trying', 'buy', 'something', 'OVA', 'was', 'end', 'FY', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'resurrect', 'bull']",N/A
717697,A2V026TK7H80V3,B00006JDSU,Carl Cheng,"[29, 30]","So many incarnations of this series.  While I love Watase Yu's stories and this one was the one that sparked my love for anime, I think.. there should be no more additions to Fushigi Yugi.  This Mysterious Game should just end.  Well, this new OAV series was brought to my attention two years ago at Anime Expo and was a big shock for me.  After 52 Episodes, a 3 episode OAV, and another 6 episode OAV, comes 4 more episodes of another OAV titled ""Eikoden.""This story sort of starts like the other OAVs have.  Normal life between Miaka, Taka, Yui, etc. except Miaka is pregnant!  All the Suzaku Warriors have been revived/reincarnated.  Well anyway, the Universe of the Four Gods keeps popping up and causing trouble.  In this chapter of the story, the antagonist, Mayo, is a high school student who is infatuated with Taka.  She's very similar to Yui in the TV series in how she wanted Taka/Tamahome and would do anything to take him away from Miaka and stuff like that.  For some reason, she has the book and enters the world in Konan and becomes the second Priestess of Suzaku.  The first twist in this whole story is that she didn't take just herself to Konan, she took Miaka's baby..Being an anime that has not even been a year old, the animation quality is very nice.  It keeps true to the original drawings that fans have been accustomed to in the past.  The lines are very clear and the colors very bright.The packaging for this DVD box set is probably its strongpoint.  It follows a trend for the past DVD box sets that come with a slip cover.  The cover for this set has Suzaku over a green granite background.  The color contrasts with Suzaku very well.  The lettering will probably be gold and shiny.  Like past DVDs, this will include a full-color booklet spanning 28 pages filled with information about the story and characters.  Also, the benefit for buying this limited edition set is the pencil boards.  You don't just get one pencil board, you get TEN of them.  They feature Miaka, Yui, and the Seven Suzaku Warriors, as well as one with a picture of characters from Eikoden.  On one side, the characters are behind beautiful cherry blossoms.  On the other, they are holding flowers in their hand.  Red flowers for Suzaku and Blue for Yui (Seiryu).  This is an incredible treat that is worth the extra dollars.Final Note:  Fushigi Yugi is my favorite anime but still, I feel that all these new additions are lessening my love for it.  I love seeing all my favorite characters again but I felt it was good enough on its own.  I'd rather more of her new series come out.  I am eagerly awaiting Alice 19th, Watase Yu's current manga, which is extremely well written.And also, the reason Pioneer is my favorite DVD distributor still is because of the fact that they treat fans well with the extras that come in their packaging.  It's the icing on the cake, and the wrapping paper for a present.",4,And then there were four..,1034380800,"10 12, 2002",2002,2908,"['So', 'many', 'incarnations', 'series', 'love', 'Watase', 'Yu', 'stories', 'one', 'was', 'one', 'sparked', 'love', 'anime', 'think..', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'additions', 'Fushigi', 'Yugi', 'Mysterious', 'Game', 'should', 'just', 'end', 'Well', 'new', 'OAV', 'series', 'was', 'brought', 'attention', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'Anime', 'Expo', 'was', 'big', 'shock', '52', 'Episodes', '3', 'episode', 'OAV', '6', 'episode', 'OAV', '4', 'more', 'episodes', 'OAV', 'titled', 'Eikoden', 'story', 'sort', 'starts', 'other', 'OAVs', 'have', 'Normal', 'life', 'Miaka', 'Taka', 'Yui', 'etc', 'Miaka', 'pregnant', 'Suzaku', 'Warriors', 'have', 'been', 'revived/reincarnated', 'Well', 'anyway', 'Universe', 'Four', 'Gods', 'popping', 'up', 'causing', 'trouble', 'chapter', 'story', 'antagonist', 'Mayo', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'infatuated', 'Taka', 'very', 'similar', 'Yui', 'TV', 'series', 'how', 'wanted', 'Taka/Tamahome', 'would', 'do', 'anything', 'take', 'away', 'Miaka', 'stuff', 'reason', 'book', 'world', 'Konan', 'second', 'Priestess', 'Suzaku', 'first', 'twist', 'whole', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'just', 'Konan', 'took', 'Miaka', 'baby..Being', 'anime', 'not', 'even', 'been', 'year', 'old', 'animation', 'quality', 'very', 'nice', 'true', 'original', 'drawings', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'accustomed', 'past', 'lines', 'are', 'very', 'clear', 'colors', 'very', 'bright.The', 'packaging', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'probably', 'strongpoint', 'trend', 'past', 'DVD', 'box', 'sets', 'come', 'slip', 'cover', 'cover', 'set', 'Suzaku', 'green', 'granite', 'background', 'color', 'Suzaku', 'very', 'well', 'lettering', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'gold', 'shiny', 'past', 'DVDs', 'will', 'include', 'full-color', 'booklet', 'spanning', '28', 'pages', 'filled', 'information', 'story', 'characters', 'Also', 'benefit', 'buying', 'limited', 'edition', 'set', 'pencil', 'boards', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'get', 'one', 'pencil', 'board', 'get', 'TEN', 'feature', 'Miaka', 'Yui', 'Seven', 'Suzaku', 'Warriors', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'picture', 'characters', 'Eikoden', 'one', 'side', 'characters', 'are', 'beautiful', 'cherry', 'blossoms', 'other', 'are', 'holding', 'flowers', 'hand', 'Red', 'flowers', 'Suzaku', 'Blue', 'Yui', 'Seiryu', 'incredible', 'treat', 'extra', 'dollars.Final', 'Note', 'Fushigi', 'Yugi', 'favorite', 'anime', 'still', 'feel', 'new', 'additions', 'are', 'lessening', 'love', 'love', 'seeing', 'favorite', 'characters', 'again', 'felt', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'own', ""'d"", 'rather', 'more', 'new', 'series', 'come', 'am', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'Alice', '19th', 'Watase', 'Yu', 'current', 'manga', 'extremely', 'well', 'written.And', 'also', 'reason', 'Pioneer', 'favorite', 'DVD', 'distributor', 'still', 'fact', 'treat', 'fans', 'well', 'extras', 'come', 'packaging', 'icing', 'cake', 'wrapping', 'paper', 'present']",N/A

While at the otakon, I got a free DVD catalog from pioneer and I saw Fushigi Yuugi Eikoden on it. Thinking ""hmm... probabaly just another anime with a similar name"" I didn't watch it right away, but I decided to check it out anyway. I was so excited when I found out what it was about! I have already searched the net and found a complete story line of what happens, but being the nice person that I am, I won't give it away.Well, Taka and Miaka get married, but there is a reason for the rush of the wedding, Miaka is pregnant! To make things worse, yet another girl has become infatuated with Tamahome, her name is Mayo(she is the kind of character you love to hate! omg i really do hate her!). She finds the Universe of the Four Gods and enters it and becomes the new priestess of Suzaku with the goal of stealing taka for herself.  Not only that, Miaka's baby is inside of Mayo now!  Taka enters the book so he can find the suzaku warriors and so he can bring back Mayo and ""reclaim"" his baby.  And I'm not gonna give anymore away than that.My friend got a copy imported from japan, it had only chinese subtitles with a japanese audio or english audio, so i was forced to listen to the horrible dub (it is painful to listen too, it really is!) i found it not to be quite up to par with the tv series, and it did have it's share of corny moments (like all shoujo anime does i suppose) but all in all, i liked it.The difference between the limited edition and the normal edition is that the limited one comes with 10 mini pencil boards.i would really recommend this if you are a FY fan!",4,More fushigi yuugi?!

I reserved my copy of the ultra edition with great anticipation.After having seen it... I was more than a little dissapointed. The episodes are cute & I'm not sorry that I purchased it, but they really left a lot to be desired. The character of Mayo was supposed to be a new ""everygirl"" for audiences to follow, but she actually comes off as incredibly unlikable, unsympathetic, & uninteresting. She seems more of a fanfiction creation (not the good type) than anything created by Watase. The idea that she's trying to erase Miaka is interesting, but it just never quite follows through with the promise. Miaka's character is actually dissapointing as well. She does what comes best to her, but in the end many of her actions are a bit too unrealistic even for an anime character. Even so, this was still entertaining to watch, even if it was only once or twice.Now onto the packaging. The packaging was incredibly well done. The colors are gorgeous & the slip sleeve was a great idea. It looks beautiful. The inside came with a nice booklet which went into detail about the series. All in all, the packaging was nice.However I just couldn't stay interested in the DVD enough to really consider it worth having. I eventually ended up trading the DVD in so I could get something I'd rather have.

There were some really glaring problems with it that kept me from giving it a higher rating, and I'll go into those in a moment, but it wasn't *bad*. The 4th episode actually brought tears to my eyes a couple times, and (unlike the first OVA) I actually understood what was going on! Like I said, it's all relative.The first issue with this OVA is the unnamed evil in the book, which appears as some REALLY GLARINGLY OBVIOUS CGI. I mean, it's... REALLY obvious! So much so, that it's completely jarring for the viewer, because it's so utterly out of place. The rest of the show is done in traditional anime. Words cannot even begin to express how weird the CGI looks in this setting.The second issue is Mayo... the reason I had to skip ahead a lot during the first couple of episodes. At one point, she rakes her fingernails against the wall in irritation. After watching her for a while, I know the feeling.And the third issue is how rushed the story is. Not that I wished it would be longer, but a great number of the problems that the Seishi encountered in this OVA were literally solved within seconds, often with the solution coming out of thin air. Not a lot of opportunity for drama.There's definitely something to be said for allowing time for buildup and character development. The original series did this quite well. This series, not so much.

717703,A2SIUOOVNZQVFY,B00006JDSU,Mare,"[10, 12]","Plot: Miaka and Taka/Tamahome get married and Miaka is pregnant. A young girl, Mayo, who is in love with Taka and jealous of Miaka finds &quot;The Universe of the Four Gods&quot; and goes into the book to become the Priestess of Suzaku, putting Miaka into a coma and taking Miaka and Taka's baby with her! Taka follows her into the book and finds the remaining two of the Suzaku seven, Chichiri and Tasuki, but they must find the other four, who have already been reborn, before it's too late and Miaka and the baby are lost forever.My thoughts: FY is tied for my favorite anime, but this OVA still isn't more than 3 stars. Miaka isn't in this one much, which is a little strange. Mayo is the kind of character some would say you love to hate. Tasuki's hair is different, which took some getting used to. My DVD is an import and just has Chinese subtitles, so I had to sit through the dub with a different voice for Tamahome, which was annoying. Has some CG effects but they don't blend with the animation well. It's worth getting for the scenes of Tasuki holding baby Chiriko (very funny) and the back story about Hotohori.

I dont particuarily go out of my way for Shojo anime(not saying that I hate it), but Fushigi yugi just had something that was special.  The charecters (especially the bad guys) were very fun to watch, and the comedy scenes involving them made me laugh.  Romantic scenes touched my heart.  And sad scenes made me cry.However, The OVA's really did not impress me.  They seemed rushed and just dident have the same effect on me as the TV serius(Not to mention, the bad guy was corny).  Eikoden suffers from the same cons.  I think comparing this to ""Star Trek:Insurrection"" would be fair, because in all ways, this had NO reason to be created but to make more money for the franchise, and it just seems very cheezy (Hotohori's brother!?!  man that was stupid).  I could mention the many other plot holes/cheezy points, but I think I'ed run out of the 1,000 word limit.  The charecters in Eikoden are also forgettable.  I dident end up hating Mayo as much as I think you were supposed to, and I thought the whole ""fake god"" thing was just doofy.  In fact, Yu Watase had nothing to do with this story.  It was orignally published in novel form(The Gaiden Novels) written by a fan.  The music and animation however, were done quite well I would have to say.  Much CGI is uutilized in a unique manner in this production.I mostly give 2 stars for packaging.  Pioneer never unimpresses me.  The extras with the disk as well as the box it comes with are great.  The special edition also contains pencil boards.  Both the regular edition and the special edition also come with a book that contains tons of info and interviews.So please, stop messing up Fushigi Yugi.  Just end it and let it rests in our hearts as one of our favorite anime shows of all time, and stop making it cheezy and taking our money for these OVA's which are not worth the fans time.  I think if another fushigi yugi OVA is made based on the Gaiden novels, please make it based off one that was charecter related(ex. The Nakago one, Seiraden).",2,Not impressive....,1041120000,"12 29, 2002",2002,2103,"['remember', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'Fushigi', 'Yugi', 'summer', '2001', 'was', 'completely', 'hooked', 'dont', 'particuarily', 'go', 'way', 'Shojo', 'anime', 'not', 'saying', 'hate', 'Fushigi', 'yugi', 'just', 'had', 'something', 'was', 'special', 'charecters', 'especially', 'bad', 'guys', 'were', 'very', 'fun', 'watch', 'comedy', 'scenes', 'involving', 'made', 'Romantic', 'scenes', 'touched', 'heart', 'sad', 'scenes', 'made', 'cry.However', 'OVA', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'impress', 'seemed', 'rushed', 'just', 'dident', 'have', 'same', 'effect', 'TV', 'serius', 'Not', 'mention', 'bad', 'guy', 'was', 'corny', 'Eikoden', 'suffers', 'same', 'cons', 'think', 'comparing', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Insurrection', 'would', 'be', 'fair', 'ways', 'had', 'NO', 'reason', 'be', 'created', 'make', 'more', 'money', 'franchise', 'just', 'very', 'cheezy', 'Hotohori', 'brother', 'man', 'was', 'stupid', 'could', 'mention', 'many', 'other', 'plot', 'holes/cheezy', 'points', 'think', ""I'ed"", 'run', '1,000', 'word', 'limit', 'charecters', 'Eikoden', 'are', 'also', 'forgettable', 'dident', 'end', 'up', 'hating', 'Mayo', 'as', 'much', 'think', 'were', 'supposed', 'thought', 'whole', 'fake', 'god', 'thing', 'was', 'just', 'doofy', 'fact', 'Yu', 'Watase', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'story', 'was', 'orignally', 'published', 'novel', 'form', 'Gaiden', 'Novels', 'written', 'fan', 'music', 'animation', 'however', 'were', 'done', 'quite', 'well', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'Much', 'CGI', 'uutilized', 'unique', 'manner', 'production.I', 'mostly', 'give', '2', 'stars', 'packaging', 'Pioneer', 'never', 'extras', 'disk', 'as', 'well', 'box', 'are', 'great', 'special', 'edition', 'also', 'pencil', 'boards', 'regular', 'edition', 'special', 'edition', 'also', 'come', 'book', 'tons', 'info', 'interviews.So', 'please', 'stop', 'messing', 'up', 'Fushigi', 'Yugi', 'Just', 'end', 'let', 'hearts', 'one', 'favorite', 'anime', 'shows', 'time', 'stop', 'making', 'cheezy', 'taking', 'money', 'OVA', 'are', 'not', 'fans', 'time', 'think', 'fushigi', 'yugi', 'OVA', 'made', 'based', 'Gaiden', 'novels', 'please', 'make', 'based', 'off', 'one', 'was', 'charecter', 'related', 'ex', 'Nakago', 'one', 'Seiraden']",N/A

717707,A3B8DR4BWZJBQQ,B00006JDSU,SR9,"[7, 8]","It's not that this story couldn't have made a place for itself in this much-loved series; if only it hadn't been so poorly done, it might have succeeded. Having read the translations of the manga for Eikoden, the story itself, while not terribly impressive, certainly could have flowed into this timeline. But what we get in video is Eikoden, a convoluted, confusing, annoying scenario slapped into four episodes bound to make many any loyal fan roll their eyes and shake their head.Where Yui might have been infuriating in her bitter vengeance, it seems difficult to believe that this overly angsty, spoiled schoolgirl Mayo is even *worth* saving, when she willingly gets herself involved in the Universe of the Four Gods. Her maliciousness and over-the-top jealous rage do not make for an interesting character. She's almost morbidly funny as an antagonist, ineffective and bratty beyond reason. A kind of Skeletor, if you will, whose malice is ridiculous. (And we're somehow supposed to feel for her at the end? They never give us a reason to like her in the first place.)We don't get more than a perfunctory glance of Miaka through this entire story. She remains an unconscious cameo after the first half of episode one, and through to just before the end. The tale really focuses around Mayo's insanity and Taka's annoyingly bland quest to save the book world. The rebirth of the Suzaku seven is kind of interesting, but the CGI monsters completely break up the standard animation, and don't fit in well at all. I have no idea what the producers were thinking.The music is actually fair, however, and we at least get a little more insight into Houki, the empress of Konan... (though the sub story she's involved in with Hotohori is another bizarre, mind-boggling situation). If this story had been stretched over many more episodes, and wasn't so determined to blow through an awkward and unimaginable plot line, it could have been something other than what it amounted to: unnecessary.I give it 1.5 stars. If you're not an FY fan that would adore anything released with these characters, I would highly recommend skipping over this poorly-done story supplement.
