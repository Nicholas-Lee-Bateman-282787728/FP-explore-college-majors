Otherwise wait to take it from off air or until another DVD company decides to do an acceptable job of transferring it. This DVD is a DVD-R with a picture that looks as if it were made from a copy of a copy VHS. My laser disc issued by Image Entertainment is of far superior quality. This DVD is a total waste of money.,1,Poor quality dvd transfer,1369440000,"05 25, 2013",2013,370,"['Buy', 'disc', 'only', 'must', 'have', 'movie', 'now', 'Otherwise', 'wait', 'take', 'off', 'air', 'DVD', 'company', 'do', 'acceptable', 'job', 'transferring', 'DVD', 'DVD-R', 'picture', 'were', 'made', 'copy', 'copy', 'VHS', 'My', 'laser', 'disc', 'issued', 'Image', 'Entertainment', 'far', 'superior', 'quality', 'DVD', 'total', 'waste', 'money']",Hustling

I was happy to see it offered on DVD, and was glad to add it to my collection. With digital downloads being pushed in favor of DVDs, the price continues to rise on films from recent history. There are some which are very worth it to me, and this is one of them.Based on a book by Gail Sheehy, this movie stars two great actresses who have since passed away. Jill Clayburgh, and Lee Remick are sorely missed. Look for Melanie Mayron of thirtysomething fame as one of the prostitutes in which Ms. Sheehy chronicles in her story.",5,Another one from the 70's I am happy to finally own.

831004,A1JEFESGLIS076,B0002CZB6O,rsoonsa,"[2, 2]","This film is based upon Gail Sheehy's pseudo-sociological book dealing with streetwalking prostitution in midtown New York, and features Lee Remick as a middle class magazine journalist who selects one particular harlot named Wanda (Jill Clayburgh) with whom she somewhat bonds in the course of investigating unsavoury real estate dealings involving socially prominent figures who ostensibly benefit from prostitution income. Despite the use of open mikes and harshly grained lighting to bring about a sense of aural and visual realism, the work suffers from a romantic approach to its subject, presenting the prostitutes and local police who arrest them as one reluctantly interlaced family, with the pimps grotesque caricatures, and the direction by Joseph Sargent vying with Jerry Fielding's jazzy score for being the most unimaginative contribution, whereas those real problems associated with this type of vice activity: venereal disease, the deleterious effect upon local business establishments, etc., are barely touched upon, indeed being submerged beneath a flurry of bootless subplots.",2,CLICHE-BURDENED FILM.,1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,1095,"['film', 'based', 'Gail', 'Sheehy', 'pseudo-sociological', 'book', 'dealing', 'streetwalking', 'prostitution', 'midtown', 'New', 'York', 'features', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'middle', 'class', 'magazine', 'journalist', 'who', 'one', 'particular', 'harlot', 'named', 'Wanda', 'Jill', 'Clayburgh', 'whom', 'somewhat', 'bonds', 'course', 'investigating', 'unsavoury', 'real', 'estate', 'dealings', 'involving', 'socially', 'prominent', 'figures', 'who', 'ostensibly', 'benefit', 'prostitution', 'income', 'use', 'open', 'mikes', 'harshly', 'grained', 'lighting', 'bring', 'about', 'sense', 'aural', 'visual', 'realism', 'work', 'suffers', 'romantic', 'approach', 'subject', 'presenting', 'prostitutes', 'local', 'police', 'who', 'arrest', 'one', 'reluctantly', 'interlaced', 'family', 'pimps', 'grotesque', 'caricatures', 'direction', 'Joseph', 'Sargent', 'vying', 'Jerry', 'Fielding', 'jazzy', 'score', 'being', 'most', 'unimaginative', 'contribution', 'real', 'problems', 'associated', 'type', 'vice', 'activity', 'venereal', 'disease', 'deleterious', 'effect', 'local', 'business', 'establishments', 'etc.', 'are', 'barely', 'touched', 'indeed', 'being', 'submerged', 'flurry', 'bootless', 'subplots']",Hustling
