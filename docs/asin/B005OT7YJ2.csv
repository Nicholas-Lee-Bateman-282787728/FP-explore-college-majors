Even though that first wave ended up being more of a fad than a phenomenon (the crash in the mid `80s nearly killed the market altogether until Nintendo resurrected it in 1987 and never looked back), that didn't stop networks like CBS and ABC from launching cartoons based on ""Pac-Man,"" ""Donkey Kong,"" ""Q*Bert,"" ""Pole Position"" and ""Dragon's Lair.""The latter made the most sense of all the games to adapt into a cartoon, since ""Dragon's Lair"" was no ordinary video game: it was one of several laser-disc games, fully animated by Don Bluth and an absolute pain in the behind to play (most of us kids would insert 50 cents and last about 5 seconds in a game that was all about memorizing moves as opposed to hand/eye coordination). Still, it looked cool with Dirk the Daring out to save Princess Daphne from the Dragon ""Singe"" in a colorful medieval castle - elements which animators Ruby-Spears wisely opted to retain in their brief Saturday morning adaptation, which the Warner Archive has brought to DVD this month.The two-disc set includes all 13 episodes of the short-lived series in acceptable full-screen transfers with mono audio. John Debney scored the series, doing a nice job infusing the limited animation pallet with majestic orchestral tones.",4,Fun for Geeks and Nostalgic Freaks,1337040000,"05 15, 2012",2012,1463,"['early', '80s', 'when', 'arcades', 'were', 'place', 'spend', 'allowance', 'money', 'Atari', '2600', 'was', 'Xbox', '360', 'day', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'TV', 'sought', 'capitalize', 'success', 'first', 'video', 'game', 'era', 'Even', 'first', 'wave', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'more', 'fad', 'phenomenon', 'crash', 'mid', '80s', 'nearly', 'killed', 'market', 'altogether', 'Nintendo', 'resurrected', '1987', 'never', 'looked', 'back', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'networks', 'CBS', 'ABC', 'launching', 'cartoons', 'based', 'Pac-Man', 'Donkey', 'Kong', 'Q*Bert', 'Pole', 'Position', 'Dragon', 'Lair', 'latter', 'made', 'most', 'sense', 'games', 'adapt', 'cartoon', 'Dragon', 'Lair', 'was', 'ordinary', 'video', 'game', 'was', 'one', 'several', 'laser-disc', 'games', 'fully', 'animated', 'Don', 'Bluth', 'absolute', 'pain', 'behind', 'play', 'most', 'kids', 'would', 'insert', '50', 'cents', 'last', '5', 'seconds', 'game', 'was', 'memorizing', 'moves', 'opposed', 'hand/eye', 'coordination', 'Still', 'looked', 'cool', 'Dirk', 'Daring', 'out', 'save', 'Princess', 'Daphne', 'Dragon', 'Singe', 'colorful', 'medieval', 'castle', 'elements', 'animators', 'Ruby-Spears', 'wisely', 'opted', 'retain', 'brief', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'adaptation', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'brought', 'DVD', 'month.The', 'two-disc', 'set', '13', 'episodes', 'short-lived', 'series', 'acceptable', 'full-screen', 'transfers', 'mono', 'audio', 'John', 'Debney', 'scored', 'series', 'doing', 'nice', 'job', 'infusing', 'limited', 'animation', 'pallet', 'majestic', 'orchestral', 'tones']",Dragon's Lair: The Complete Series

1496791,A13MN6DAKT9HZB,B005OT7YJ2,Michael McGinnis Jr,"[0, 0]","If you know the original Dragon's Lair games then you know they were beautifully animated by Don Bluth, showed over the top action, death scenes and above all slapstick humor.While the series tries its best to emulate the games it falls short in many places. The animation is well done but nowhere near the detail and luster of the Don Bluth game animation.The action in the series is nearly constant as well as the slap-stick humor which is mostly provided by the hapless Dirk the Daring and his squire Timothy as well as the Giddy Goons employed by Singe the Dragon.While the show's death scene aspect isn't nearly as violent or graphic as the games it still manages to make you feel bad or horrified if you chose the wrong course of action in the &#34;What should Dirk do?&#34; segments. Basically before each commercial break when the series originally aired on Saturday morning cartoons Dirk would find himself in a life or death situation and the narrator would ask you the viewer &#34;What should Dirk do?&#34;Most times the wrong choice leads to a horrific death or some sort of injury for Dirk. Many happen off screen so it's not too violent for younger kids.Also there are some &#34;What should Dirk Do?&#34; segments where they don't give you the full choices of what he can do so no matter what you pick you lose which seems vindictive or at the very least poor planning by the creators.As is typical with many cartoons of the 80s the show usually tries to teach a moral like lying is bad or stealing is wrong so it does try to balance out the violence with a moral.Still despite its few shortcomings its a fun show full of quests, knights, magic and damsels in distress. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of sword and sorcery tales.",3,A great show but not as good as the games,1397865600,"04 19, 2014",2014,1757,"['know', 'original', 'Dragon', 'Lair', 'games', 'then', 'know', 'were', 'beautifully', 'animated', 'Don', 'Bluth', 'showed', 'top', 'action', 'death', 'scenes', 'slapstick', 'humor.While', 'series', 'best', 'emulate', 'games', 'short', 'many', 'places', 'animation', 'well', 'done', 'nowhere', 'detail', 'luster', 'Don', 'Bluth', 'game', 'animation.The', 'action', 'series', 'nearly', 'constant', 'as', 'well', 'slap-stick', 'humor', 'mostly', 'provided', 'hapless', 'Dirk', 'Daring', 'squire', 'Timothy', 'as', 'well', 'Giddy', 'Goons', 'employed', 'Singe', 'Dragon.While', 'show', 'death', 'scene', 'aspect', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'violent', 'graphic', 'games', 'still', 'make', 'feel', 'bad', 'horrified', 'chose', 'wrong', 'course', 'action', '34', 'What', 'should', 'Dirk', 'do', '34', 'segments', 'Basically', 'commercial', 'break', 'when', 'series', 'originally', 'aired', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoons', 'Dirk', 'would', 'find', 'life', 'death', 'situation', 'narrator', 'would', 'ask', 'viewer', '34', 'What', 'should', 'Dirk', 'do', '34', 'Most', 'wrong', 'choice', 'horrific', 'death', 'sort', 'injury', 'Dirk', 'Many', 'happen', 'off', 'screen', 'not', 'too', 'violent', 'younger', 'kids.Also', 'are', '34', 'What', 'should', 'Dirk', 'Do', '34', 'segments', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'full', 'choices', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'so', 'no', 'matter', 'what', 'pick', 'lose', 'vindictive', 'very', 'least', 'poor', 'planning', 'creators.As', 'typical', 'many', 'cartoons', '80s', 'show', 'usually', 'teach', 'moral', 'lying', 'bad', 'stealing', 'wrong', 'try', 'balance', 'out', 'violence', 'moral.Still', 'few', 'shortcomings', 'fun', 'show', 'full', 'quests', 'knights', 'magic', 'damsels', 'distress', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'sword', 'sorcery', 'tales']",Dragon's Lair: The Complete Series
1496792,A2K9FGSRD400EF,B005OT7YJ2,Rayne Labelle,"[2, 2]","I have always been a fan of classic cartoons, and I loved the video game, too. This is a good cartoon to accompany the series. The only problems I have is the fact that Dirk didn't have a squire, and Singe, the dragon, did not talk. I imagine they added these things to make the show more interesting. But, overall, it follows the general tone of the game, even asking viewers what Dirk should do in certain situations, and then showing the outcome of each decision. The video quality is outstanding. Either the show wasn't played very much, or Warner Bros. took great care to restore it. Either way, the picture looks fantastic. No complaints there. Even though the animation wasn't done by Don Bluth, it's still worth checking out if you're a fan of Dragon's Lair, or of classic cartoons in general.",4,Great restoration job!,1367366400,"05 1, 2013",2013,801,"['have', 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'classic', 'cartoons', 'loved', 'video', 'game', 'too', 'good', 'cartoon', 'accompany', 'series', 'only', 'problems', 'have', 'fact', 'Dirk', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'squire', 'Singe', 'dragon', 'did', 'not', 'talk', 'imagine', 'added', 'things', 'make', 'show', 'more', 'interesting', 'overall', 'general', 'tone', 'game', 'even', 'asking', 'viewers', 'what', 'Dirk', 'should', 'do', 'certain', 'situations', 'then', 'showing', 'outcome', 'decision', 'video', 'quality', 'outstanding', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'played', 'very', 'much', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'took', 'great', 'care', 'restore', 'way', 'picture', 'fantastic', 'complaints', 'there', 'Even', 'animation', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'Don', 'Bluth', 'still', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Dragon', 'Lair', 'classic', 'cartoons', 'general']",Dragon's Lair: The Complete Series
