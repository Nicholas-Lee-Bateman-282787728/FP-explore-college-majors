167743,A1LBGXE29GG1IR,1400316111,"Coffee Addicted Writer's Reviews ""Billy""","[2, 2]","While teaching at the Bible Adventure Training Academy, the Bibleman's (a human transformed by the word of God) secret weapon, the armor is God is stolen by the treacherous villains. Bibleman and his Bible Team must stop the villains from using the weapon against them.I honestly never knew anything about Bibleman when I received this DVD to review. Not counting the bonus features, the LIVE episode is under forty minutes, and was somewhat painful for me to watch. It's obvious that this shows is aimed for a younger audience. The acting is horrible, the costumes are silly, and the special effects are even worse. It reminds me of the ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"" but with a Christian twist to it. Bibleman is like a superhero with a light saber. There are a few fight scenes to keep a kid's interests. Despite the moral messages, the story is still the basic good vs. evil storyline, but with bad production values.",2,Silly,1337731200,"05 23, 2012",2012,922,"['teaching', 'Bible', 'Adventure', 'Training', 'Academy', 'Bibleman', 'human', 'transformed', 'word', 'God', 'weapon', 'armor', 'God', 'stolen', 'treacherous', 'villains', 'Bibleman', 'Bible', 'Team', 'must', 'stop', 'villains', 'using', 'weapon', 'them.I', 'honestly', 'never', 'knew', 'anything', 'Bibleman', 'when', 'received', 'DVD', 'review', 'Not', 'counting', 'bonus', 'features', 'LIVE', 'episode', 'forty', 'minutes', 'was', 'somewhat', 'painful', 'watch', 'obvious', 'aimed', 'younger', 'audience', 'acting', 'horrible', 'costumes', 'are', 'silly', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'even', 'worse', 'Mighty', 'Morphin', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Christian', 'twist', 'Bibleman', 'superhero', 'light', 'saber', 'are', 'few', 'fight', 'scenes', 'keep', 'kid', 'interests', 'moral', 'messages', 'story', 'still', 'basic', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'storyline', 'bad', 'production', 'values']",N/A
167744,A6D07P6DHMXIP,1400316111,"L. Courtney ""Book Mom""","[0, 0]","Bibleman is a spiritual super hero.  He came to know the Lord as a young boy during a difficult time in his life, and as he grew he studied and learned the Bible to join the ranks of those who use God Word to stand against evil!.  This particular DVD is a live action drama filmed in front of a live audience in a church.Bibleman and his friends find a secret weapon.  It is so new and so secret that no one knows exactly how it works.  Before they can discover the secret of the weapon and how to use it, it is stolen by the powers of evil.  The evil ones attempt to find out the secret of the weapon and use it against Bibleman and his friends.  Bibleman and his friends recover the weapon and find out what it really is in time.  Along the way, they learn more about the power of God's Word to defeat evil.This was the first Bibleman movie I have seen, although I have heard of them and seen them in Christian book stores.  I didn't realize that it was a live drama being performed in front of an audience. Ashlyne and Rachel (ages 5 and 4) enjoyed the movie more than Charles (age 9).  Charles did get caught up in the action and watching to see if the secret weapon would be recovered.  Charles and I both liked the use of Scripture all throughout the show.At the end of the movie, a very straightforward Gospel presentation is given.  I did like that, but I did not like the fact that they gave a ""pray this prayer after me"" invitation on the DVD.  [I'm not really a fan of salvation invitations where children come forward and repeat a prayer.  I prefer that children are counseled individually, so that their questions can be answered and they can have a better understanding of what they are doing.  (Just my personal opinion, feel free to disagree.)]Overall, I think we liked the video and would probably watch more of them with my children.  We like to memorize Scripture with the kids, and this was a great tool for that.  I would recommend it especially for younger kids who will like the drama and special effects and won't think the acting is a bit corny.&lt;span style=""font-style:italic;"">Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their [..] book review bloggers program.

167745,A1Q62S1E5H3Q2A,1400316111,Lisa R.,"[0, 0]",I recently was able to view a copy of Bibleman: Combating the Commandant of Confusion ~ a live adventure. This DVD was action packed! Talk about adventure! Bibleman is a great hero for children and I just love how he quotes scripture throughout his adventure.This adventure was a filmed live show where the audience is part of a Bible Training Academy. I don't want to give too much away but the live action fighting was AWESOME! My 9 year old was impressed with the sword play. There was plenty of drama and music to keep you captivated!The best part of this DVD was that Bibleman tells you how you can become a Soldier for Christ. There is a Salvation message at the end and a call to God! I just loved it ~ my son asked if we could watch it again!,4,Great DVD,1269907200,"03 30, 2010",2010,750,"['recently', 'was', 'able', 'view', 'copy', 'Bibleman', 'Combating', 'Commandant', 'Confusion', '~', 'live', 'adventure', 'DVD', 'was', 'action', 'packed', 'Talk', 'adventure', 'Bibleman', 'great', 'hero', 'children', 'just', 'love', 'how', 'scripture', 'adventure.This', 'adventure', 'was', 'filmed', 'live', 'show', 'where', 'audience', 'part', 'Bible', 'Training', 'Academy', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'live', 'action', 'fighting', 'was', 'AWESOME', '9', 'year', 'old', 'was', 'impressed', 'sword', 'play', 'was', 'plenty', 'drama', 'music', 'keep', 'captivated', 'best', 'part', 'DVD', 'was', 'Bibleman', 'how', 'can', 'become', 'Soldier', 'Christ', 'Salvation', 'message', 'end', 'call', 'God', 'just', 'loved', '~', 'son', 'asked', 'could', 'watch', 'again']",N/A

But they do not pay proper attention to the warning label and do not follow instructions closely.Bibleman is a Christian super hero. He combats various villains with his friends Cypher and BibleGirl. This particular episode is a live action show and as such, has limited production resources. The show also was made in a short-budget, but what really matters after all is the message that is transmitted to the target audience, the little kids. The theological content is excellent and the movie teaches the kids to trust in God. If you want to expose your children to this type of message, this is the correct choice. Just do not expect high quality or Broadway type production or you will be disappointed.",4,Combating the Commandant of Confusion,1268524800,"03 14, 2010",2010,1071,"['Christian', 'DVD', 'movie', 'published', '2010', 'Thomas', 'Nelson', 'were', 'kind', 'enough', 'send', 'copy', 'reviewing', 'Thomas', 'Nelson', 'Book', 'Review', 'Bloggers', 'Program', 'new', 'BookSneeze', 'Program.The', 'Commandant', 'Confusion', 'helper', 'Chaos', 'decided', 'steal', 'secret', 'weapon', 'Bible', 'Team', 'put', 'full', 'armor', 'God', 'do', 'not', 'pay', 'proper', 'attention', 'warning', 'label', 'do', 'not', 'follow', 'instructions', 'closely.Bibleman', 'Christian', 'super', 'hero', 'various', 'villains', 'friends', 'Cypher', 'BibleGirl', 'particular', 'episode', 'live', 'action', 'show', 'such', 'limited', 'production', 'resources', 'show', 'also', 'was', 'made', 'short-budget', 'what', 'really', 'matters', 'message', 'transmitted', 'target', 'audience', 'little', 'kids', 'theological', 'content', 'excellent', 'movie', 'kids', 'trust', 'God', 'want', 'expose', 'children', 'type', 'message', 'correct', 'choice', 'Just', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'high', 'quality', 'Broadway', 'type', 'production', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

Bibleman and his team race to recover it.  During the adventure kids learn scripture and character lessons.  This is an interesting and action packed episode.  Most boys ages 6-10 love an action filled character they can relate to.  Bibleman is that hero.  Bibleman is a great character with a godly mindset and he relies on God and Scripture to save the day.  Bibleman is a superhero who teaches kids to trust in God and to conqueror evil by using scripture.  In today's society kids need a hero who wants God's best.  A great dvd!
