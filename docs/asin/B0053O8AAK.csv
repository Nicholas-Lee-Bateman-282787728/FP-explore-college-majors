I feel this season have been true to the original first few season of the office. I just finished watching season 8  and I've loved every episode and I find the characters are developing so well! All the characters are lovable and I love that they get to be part of the show so much more! Michael Scott leaving actually gave the show some elbow room for character development and story line. I only gave this 4 stars because there weren't any commentaries and I love those.So if you love Michael Scott so much that you won't give this a chance, then you won't like these last few seasons.

1440132,A35AFXBYZ4WK2O,B0053O8AAK,C. D. White,"[45, 59]","Don't get me wrong, The Office isn't what it used to be, and Steve Carell's departure has hurt this flailing show taking everything into consideration. But it's too easy to point the finger at Catherine Tate and James Spader as reasons that this season was sub-par by Office standards and average by most other TV comedy standards. The fact is James Spader and Catherine Tate as Robert California and Nellie Bertram were actually continually funny throughout the season to me. And why that's so is because both of those characters are absolutely insane. That was the main ingrediant to what made the show head and shoulders above anything before it when it first started. It also had a compelling love story with Jim and Pam and besides those two characters pretty much everyone else was either completely bonkers and had some odd quirks. As the show has progressed, those characters were either toned down or became charicatures of themselves and the enduring love story has become painfully boring.The main problem as any die hard Office fan knows stems from the writing. Andy was my favorite character and in a strange stroke of misfortune for me as a viewer Ed Helms became famous which meant the writers felt compelled to make Andy Bernard more like Stu Price. But what made Andy funny was that for the most part we used to laugh at him now we are supposed to laugh with him. The writers tried to shoehorn an upper class jerk with anger issues into a relatable character. In doing so we are basically supposed to forget who he used to be. I have been alternating watching season 3 and season 8 recently and the Andy of season 3 is a completely different person than the Andy of season 8. Real people don't change as much in 5 years as Andy has on this show, so why do the writers think we should accept this...in a mockumentary no less! But Andy is just one of many characters that has gone through this weird transformation from a quirky character into either a charaicature of themselves (Dwight, Kevin, Meredith etc.) or a bland version of the original character (Andy, Pam, Creed etc.). As others have said they tried to make Andy and Erin the new Jim and Pam but since Jim and Pam are ostensibly the only normal people (besides Darryl and Toby at first) it was doomed to fail. In fact, the Darryl and Val relationship was a way more compelling love story this season than Andy and Erin because again those two character are more or less normal.But back to Robert and Nellie, like I said I thought they provided some of the best moments this season because they are weirdos. And along that line I think the people giving this season 1 star are overreacting. Obviously, the show is not what it used to be, but I still laugh at it occasionally and there were still some episodes this season that actually hung together for the whole episode. Also, I was encouraged with David Wallace coming back. I always HATED the Sabre story line so it's definitely a good thing to be rid of that. And frankly, I'm also not upset to see Mindy Kaling leave, she has been increasingly annoying as Kelly Kapoor since she and Ryan got back together. And I also think the increasing cutesyness and references to pop culure and internet sensations come from her as a writer so hopefully that stuff will stop now. Paul Lieberstien as Toby serves no purpose now that Michael is gone. Lieberstien as a writer may be missed but I can't remember a Lieberstien written episode that I like since season 4. So I don't know about that. I will say that I have low expectations for the planned Dwight spinoff that he will be the show runner of.So with all of that being said I do think there are things that could possibly be good in season 9. And it's not like every second of this season was unwatchable...it's just not as good as it used to be. But sub par Office is still way better than above average Two and a Half Men.",3,A Mixed Bag,1342569600,"07 18, 2012",2012,3901,"['Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Office', ""n't"", 'what', 'used', 'be', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'departure', 'hurt', 'flailing', 'show', 'taking', 'everything', 'consideration', 'too', 'easy', 'point', 'finger', 'Catherine', 'Tate', 'James', 'Spader', 'reasons', 'season', 'was', 'sub-par', 'Office', 'standards', 'average', 'most', 'other', 'TV', 'comedy', 'standards', 'fact', 'James', 'Spader', 'Catherine', 'Tate', 'Robert', 'California', 'Nellie', 'Bertram', 'were', 'actually', 'continually', 'funny', 'season', 'why', 'so', 'characters', 'are', 'absolutely', 'insane', 'was', 'main', 'ingrediant', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'head', 'shoulders', 'anything', 'when', 'first', 'started', 'also', 'had', 'compelling', 'love', 'story', 'Jim', 'Pam', 'two', 'characters', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'completely', 'bonkers', 'had', 'odd', 'quirks', 'show', 'progressed', 'characters', 'were', 'either', 'toned', 'down', 'became', 'charicatures', 'enduring', 'love', 'story', 'become', 'painfully', 'boring.The', 'main', 'problem', 'die', 'hard', 'Office', 'fan', 'writing', 'Andy', 'was', 'favorite', 'character', 'strange', 'stroke', 'misfortune', 'viewer', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'became', 'famous', 'meant', 'writers', 'felt', 'compelled', 'make', 'Andy', 'Bernard', 'more', 'Stu', 'Price', 'what', 'made', 'Andy', 'funny', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'used', 'laugh', 'now', 'are', 'supposed', 'laugh', 'writers', 'tried', 'shoehorn', 'upper', 'class', 'jerk', 'anger', 'issues', 'relatable', 'character', 'doing', 'are', 'basically', 'supposed', 'forget', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'have', 'been', 'alternating', 'watching', 'season', '3', 'season', '8', 'recently', 'Andy', 'season', '3', 'completely', 'different', 'person', 'Andy', 'season', '8', 'Real', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'change', 'as', 'much', '5', 'years', 'Andy', 'show', 'so', 'why', 'do', 'writers', 'think', 'should', 'accept', 'mockumentary', 'less', 'Andy', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'characters', 'gone', 'weird', 'transformation', 'quirky', 'character', 'charaicature', 'Dwight', 'Kevin', 'Meredith', 'etc', 'bland', 'version', 'original', 'character', 'Andy', 'Pam', 'Creed', 'etc.', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'tried', 'make', 'Andy', 'Erin', 'new', 'Jim', 'Pam', 'Jim', 'Pam', 'are', 'ostensibly', 'only', 'normal', 'people', 'Darryl', 'Toby', 'first', 'was', 'doomed', 'fail', 'fact', 'Darryl', 'Val', 'relationship', 'was', 'way', 'more', 'compelling', 'love', 'story', 'season', 'Andy', 'Erin', 'because', 'again', 'two', 'character', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'normal.But', 'back', 'Robert', 'Nellie', 'said', 'thought', 'provided', 'best', 'moments', 'season', 'are', 'weirdos', 'line', 'think', 'people', 'giving', 'season', '1', 'star', 'are', 'overreacting', 'Obviously', 'show', 'not', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'still', 'laugh', 'occasionally', 'were', 'still', 'episodes', 'season', 'actually', 'together', 'whole', 'episode', 'Also', 'was', 'encouraged', 'David', 'Wallace', 'coming', 'back', 'always', 'HATED', 'Sabre', 'story', 'line', 'definitely', 'good', 'thing', 'be', 'rid', 'frankly', ""'m"", 'also', 'not', 'upset', 'see', 'Mindy', 'Kaling', 'leave', 'been', 'increasingly', 'annoying', 'Kelly', 'Kapoor', 'Ryan', 'got', 'back', 'together', 'also', 'think', 'increasing', 'cutesyness', 'references', 'pop', 'culure', 'internet', 'sensations', 'come', 'writer', 'so', 'hopefully', 'stuff', 'will', 'stop', 'now', 'Paul', 'Lieberstien', 'Toby', 'purpose', 'now', 'Michael', 'gone', 'Lieberstien', 'writer', 'may', 'be', 'missed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'Lieberstien', 'written', 'episode', 'like', 'season', '4', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'will', 'say', 'have', 'low', 'expectations', 'planned', 'Dwight', 'spinoff', 'will', 'be', 'show', 'runner', 'being', 'said', 'do', 'think', 'are', 'things', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'good', 'season', '9', 'not', 'like', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'unwatchable', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'used', 'be', 'sub', 'par', 'Office', 'still', 'way', 'better', 'above', 'average', 'Two', 'Half', 'Men']",The Office: Season Eight

Quite simply, this show makes me laugh, and it makes me FEEL GOOD! It's the only show on T.V. that compels me to tune in every week. I realize the season is not completely over yet, but I feel that even if there were no more episodes after the 15th one (which just aired), I would still give this year's effort a 5 star rating... it's just been that much fun for me to watch.The strength of The Office has always been its brilliant casting. From the dreary HR rep (Toby) to the bubbly Customer Service employee (Kelly) to the gung-ho salesman (Dwight), and everybody else (Stanley, Kevin, Creed, Andy, Erin, Oscar, Meredith, Angela, Todd Packer, etc.). These characters nail the essence of their stereotypes (as anybody who has worked in an office can tell you!), and they do it with hilarity. It's because of this incredibly strong cast that the show can go on, should any one character leave the show... including the loveable Michael Scott.

There seems to be a even split between Office fans that the new season is terrible, or the new season is still good stuff.  I say it is good stuff.  I really enjoy Spader in the show.  The first four seasons are the best, pure and simple.  Then, while there are moments in seasons 5-7, there were more moments--for me--where it was just too cringe inducing to handle.  I guess to put my money where my mouth is, I own seasons 1-4, and I plan on buying season 8, not sure what I'm going to do about seasons 5-7.  So, if you didn't watch this season because Michael/Steve was gone, you owe it to yourselves to watch this, based upon all us diehards, it looks like there is a 50% chance that you are going to really like the show.  Hey, what else are you going to do?  Watch all the shows about crackheads, methheads, badass biker dudes, serial killer killers, dead guys, dying guys, zombies, and crime based shows showing us rape, child molestation, incest, torture killing, thrill killing--and all of the ridiculously pretty/handsome ""agents"" who are trying to solve the crimes etc, etc?

1440155,A3G4BFD7FN8VF1,B0053O8AAK,Marvin Powell,"[2, 3]","You know, I hate to be that guy who points out that Steve Carell leaving the show was  what killed it. And in some ways, this isn't even accurate. While Michael Scott was a driving force behind The Office, the show COULD survive without him. It's just too bad the writers and producers never really figured out how.This entire season was one big clusterf--k of 'What the hell is going on?' So, without any on-camera buildup or true explanation, Andy becomes the new boss and replaces Michael Scott. Now, it seems to me, the creators of the show should know how their own show is scuccessful. Especially if you're going to replace the STAR of a show. (This is the case, even if the star is no one that important, such as Topher Grace leaving ""That 70's Show""; it still went downhill from there). As much as Ed Helms' character of Andy Bernard is so much more likable than he used to be, the key to a successful Dunder Mifflin boss is that you can't really respect them. Or think that they could really be a regional manager in real life. Andy fails with this as he IS smart enough and restrained enough to be a real life boss. Granted, not of a company the size of Dunder Mifflin(/Sabre), but Ed Helms' character is still too believable to fit this role, here. Which results in BORING episodes. Stuff, where they literally had to find something for them to do. Like Andy getting a tattoo to win his co-workers respect. ...What was this? The fact that writers were so lost even BEFORE the season began is not a good sign.Oh, and let's talk about the Black Hole of comedy that is James Spader. I mean, don't get me wrong. Spader is good when he has his moments, like in Boston Legal. But just like Nic Cage, basically, James Spader only ever plays himself. Only, as Robert California, he now plays himself saying weird and inappropriate sexual things. I also assume the writers couldn't balance his Crazy/Genius act for too long and just decided to make him an Eccentric Con Artist and master manipulator rather than a barely sane Mad Scientist/SuperGenius. But the point is, James Spader in The Office makes about as much sense as Rainn Wilson playing a new forensics expert in Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. ...Wait. No. I take that back. Rainn Wilson  actually has the acting range (and believable nerd-isms) to pull that off. James Spader just doesn't fit in The Office as much as James Spader doesn't fit in ANY comedy, anywhere. What's worse is, his highly unlikable character whose only redeemable quality is that he's too confusing to fully dislike. Robert California scams influential people and knows much less than his air of confidence exudes. Regardless of all of this though, he's just simply NOT FUNNY.Okay, so halfway through this entire mess, things start to slightly show a glimmer of hope with the Sabre Store arc, which brings back Nellie Bertram, played by Catherine Tate. The arc itself shows promise, but the writers drop the ball on this one, pretty much only getting Stanley's ""wild Florida persona"" right. But they also introduce a very confusing storyline where adorable Erin decides to stay in Florida in order to run away from her feelings with Andy, and Andy abandons his job to go chase her, despite not knowing what's going on with her. Before all this, though, we have the return of Todd Packer (who was great years ago, but his character is long past his prime at this point) who establishes a rivalry with Dwight in who will head the Sabre Store project. A lame storyline that's only trumped by a super-weak attempt to introduce a seductress into Jim's life, and try to throw a wrench in his happy marriage. Of course, the whole Cathy Simms plot was so rushed and poorly done, it might as well have never even been attempted. Eventually, Jim saves Dwight from heading the Sabre Store project, which was all a scam and destined to fail anyway, and Packer becomes the scapegoat and gets fired for it. Now, all of this could've worked if they had 1) Not made such a chaotic mess with it all and 2) not treated the Scranton branch during all of this as an afterthought. Just a lot of stuff going on and not much of it with any value. The only important things here that happened is the Sabre Store arc was a waste of time (in-universe, and in real life) and Andy reveals his true feelings to Erin, despite already having a girlfriend... who we are never given any reason for her existence or reason for liking a goofball like Andy, despite her drull, real life personality.So after this whole confusing, muddled Tallahassee mess, Andy, while shirking his manager responsibilities to get Erin back, loses his job in an elaborate coup perpetrated by Nellie Bertram (who avoided going down with the Sabre Store disaster). And so NOW, after an entire Summer and much of the end of last season, the writers STILL don't know who should be manager![* In my opinion, bringing Melora Hardin back as Jan would've worked out best, as she's an already established character, has been proven to be funny, and would have no bad blood with the company since it's Sabre now, but I digress.]Now, Nellie Bertram is manager. And although many will be mixed on this, I feel she actually WORKED in the role! Just like Michael, Nellie is barely competent, highly appropriate, and would never be a believable regional manager in real life. It seems like the spark is back and the potential for comedy on The Office has returned, only the writers never know what to do with Nellie! And after more confusion, she eventually loses her job again to Andy, after he hits rock bottom, gets fired by California, and does some 'soul searching' to grow a spine, man-up, and take back what's his. This leads into the Season Finale, where Andy Buckley returns as David Wallace, who inexplicably gets rich again, and is able to orchestrate a buyout of Dunder Mifflin with major help from Andy. Nellie is de-throned (which personally, I feel was a horrible choice and makes the writers look even more like they're as confused as a bunch of headless chickens, as Jo Bennett might possibly say.) This supposedly sets up the return of the ""old"" Sabreless Dunder-Mifflin for Season 9, only most of this never comes to fruition and David Wallace, as well as the pre-Sabre Dunder-Mifflin, never really return.And what did Pam and Jim even do this entire season? I'm pretty sure it must've been something, but the fact it can't even be easily remembered just says enough about their characters, at this point in the series. I'm petty sure they just had another baby and that's it. The only character who had any kind of decent potential storyline this entire season was Dwight, possibly knocking up a now-engaged Angela. Only, the whole Dwight/Angela romance seems so dated and ""been there, done that"" now. It's really boring, at this point.[* Not to play writer myself, but what ever happened to the amazonian dentist friend of Pam, Isabel Poreba? It would've made more sense for her to be happily in a relationship with Dwight, and Angela, having falling out of love with ""The Senator,"" engages in an affair with Dwight, which is very much in line with her hypocritical character, gets pregnant. Dwight could've argued Isabel is ""bad in bed"" or ""not as petit and dainty"" as Angela or something like that, and it would've better set up the whole Baby Daddy Mystery storyline. But you're not here to hear my What If's. Just saying, that would've made more sense and worked better, IMO. It also would've gotten rid of the need for Cathy Simms' stupid Mistress storyline with Jim.]I've been a big Office fan since it's initial run in 2005 and own every season on DVD. However, this will be the first one I won't own. This season was so terrible, it needs to be de-canonized. As in, no one ever mentions anything that occured in this season, ever. Just a big, giant confusing mess for the writers and stupid storyline after the other. Again, I don't think Steve Carell's absence is a major factor in why this season sucked so badly, but it sure seemed to trip up the writers pretty badly. Not to mention, 2013's Season 9 (which again, introduces two annoying, very unlikable characters no one asked for, just when we finally get rid of Gabe Lewis) so far doesn't seem to be much better. While seeing the show end before we get sick of it would've left us wanting more, I'd much rather have the show end on top than slump into embarassment like Season 8. ""Seinfeld"" was able to go out on top.

Fonseca ""carmarthen""","[1, 2]","I went for this season fully knowing that things would not be the same without Michael Scott/Carell, but I also knew that the show is called ""The Office"" and not something like ""Buffy"" or ""Angel"". It is based on a strong ensemble cast. No doubt Carell was the star of the show, but I thought it could survive reasonably well without him. So, since I enjoy the show a lot, I bought it without thinking twice.But I was wrong. The season really struggled in the first episodes. It was not only the absence of Carell, but it seemed to me that show running also changed, whoever was in charge did not ge the feel and essence of the show (of course, these are tottaly subjecitve topics). Some of the difficulty, I think, was due to the fact that Andy Bernard is not Michael Scote, that meaning: he is not insane. The really insane characters at the Office are Michael Scott (dellusional, no limits about being ridiculous, etc), Creed (no comments) and Dwight. The other people are not crazy. They all have their idiossincrasies, but are not in the level of madness of the character I mentioned before. So, one could not try to make Bernard goes suddenly crazy.But, to my surprise, when I was struggling to the episodes, I think things really found their way after (and including) the DOOMSDAY episode, about the ""Accountability Booster"" (according to Dwight). And, yes, the rest of the ensemble had a little bit more screen time (except for Creed - his screen time even dwindled!). There is the introduction of a female character in the wharehouse, to act as love interest toJames Spader's Robert California is awful. Spader made the character so obnoxious and aloof and one-dimensional and aloof. No wonder he was gone after this sesason.Some people disliked the Nellis character, but I found her very funny indeed.",4,"Good season, with some down moments.",1356307200,"12 24, 2012",2012,1810,"['went', 'season', 'fully', 'knowing', 'things', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'same', 'Michael', 'Scott/Carell', 'also', 'knew', 'show', 'called', 'Office', 'not', 'something', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'based', 'strong', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'doubt', 'Carell', 'was', 'star', 'show', 'thought', 'could', 'survive', 'reasonably', 'well', 'So', 'enjoy', 'show', 'lot', 'bought', 'thinking', 'twice.But', 'was', 'wrong', 'season', 'really', 'struggled', 'first', 'episodes', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'absence', 'Carell', 'seemed', 'show', 'running', 'also', 'changed', 'whoever', 'was', 'charge', 'did', 'not', 'ge', 'feel', 'essence', 'show', 'course', 'are', 'tottaly', 'subjecitve', 'topics', 'difficulty', 'think', 'was', 'due', 'fact', 'Andy', 'Bernard', 'not', 'Michael', 'Scote', 'meaning', 'not', 'insane', 'really', 'insane', 'characters', 'Office', 'are', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'dellusional', 'limits', 'being', 'ridiculous', 'etc', 'Creed', 'comments', 'Dwight', 'other', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'crazy', 'have', 'idiossincrasies', 'are', 'not', 'level', 'madness', 'character', 'mentioned', 'before', 'So', 'one', 'could', 'not', 'try', 'make', 'Bernard', 'suddenly', 'crazy.But', 'surprise', 'when', 'was', 'struggling', 'episodes', 'think', 'things', 'really', 'found', 'way', 'including', 'DOOMSDAY', 'episode', 'Accountability', 'Booster', 'according', 'Dwight', 'yes', 'rest', 'ensemble', 'had', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Creed', 'screen', 'time', 'even', 'dwindled', 'introduction', 'female', 'character', 'wharehouse', 'act', 'love', 'interest', 'toJames', 'Spader', 'Robert', 'California', 'awful', 'Spader', 'made', 'character', 'so', 'obnoxious', 'aloof', 'one-dimensional', 'aloof', 'wonder', 'was', 'gone', 'sesason.Some', 'people', 'disliked', 'Nellis', 'character', 'found', 'very', 'funny', 'indeed']",The Office: Season Eight

1440159,A27L5L6I7OSV5B,B0053O8AAK,Otto Correct,"[32, 42]","Wow, in this past season of the Office, the show's quality fell straight off a cliff.I'm fine with Michael leaving, there was plenty of comedic talent among the cast to make it an enjoyable show without him, but the writing was super lazy and no one seemed to have any idea where anything was going.  This was most manifest in the two new characters they brought aboard. (SPOILERS ahead, for all who care)James Spader as Robert California started out (in the season 7 finale) as a character that seemed to be either a genius or a con-man making it up as he went along.  Throughout all of Season 8, it seemed like the writers never figured out for themselves what they wanted him to be.  One episode he's a drunk screwing everything up.  The next he's 3 steps ahead of everyone else.  Ultimately he was both as he managed to run the company into the ground and yet convince David Wallace to give him a million dollars severance to go abroad Europe ""training"" teenage gymnasts in what had to be one of the dumbest character moments the show has ever had (I mean, really? David Wallace can't see through Robert's BS, but the entire office INCLUDING KEVIN can????  And they say NOTHING????).Catherine Tate as Nellie.  Plenty of fans hated her, and its not hard to see why.  Personally, I think her character had potential, but again the writers didn't know who she was going to be.  She seemed confidant and together for the Sable store stuff, then admits to the camera in a later episode she doesn't have any idea what she's doing.  By the time she's in the main office she seemed like a new antagonist for Andy, but in some episodes they're trying to paint her sympathetically and give her relatable flaws (the memory box in the moving episode, the shopaholic stuff that Pam uncovers, the lame ""fish-out-of-water"" taco bit with Darryl) so is she supposed to be a character we hate or not?  The result was that most fans really didn't like her but I, for one, have no idea if that was the actual intention.Some plot threads were introduced just to be dropped without much development.  Angela's baby, her possibly gay husband, California's wife, Andy's new girlfriend, that one lady trying to get Jim to sleep with her, etc. all seemed like they were going to be somewhat important only to surprise us by not getting much screen time after their introduction, with many things being wrapped up before they even have a chance to begin.  It was like the writers lit a series of firecrackers only to have every single one of them not go off.Other plot points were just stupid, plain and simple.  I've already mentioned the boneheaded way California was sent off, but you can add Nellie getting Andy's job just by SITTING IN HIS CHAIR as the dumbest thing that's ever happened on this show.  That was compounded by Andy KEEPING HER ON STAFF at the end, despite her constant efforts to wreck him up til this point (again, including TAKING HIS JOB).  This show has already strayed pretty far from its realistic mockumentary roots, but this kinda stuff is so far beyond the realm of plausibility its honestly shocking the writers attempted to pass it off on a show like this.There were other smaller issues too, but these major things, compounded by some unaddressed problems present in the last couple of years (Jim and Pam having nothing really to do now that they're married, Dwight's ever greater transformation to a living cartoon character) make this the worst year the Office has ever had.If the one star rating seems a little harsh, let it be known that there were a few chuckle inducing moments (Kevin's disbelief that anyone would put a mummy in a museum was pretty great, and you can always count a few great Creed moments), and this is hardly the worst comedy on TV, but if the earlier seasons were 5 star, and the last couple of years were 3, I have no choice but to rate this season as a 1, it really was that bad in comparison to eveything that's come before it.That said, I'll be watching season 9.  Not only is it the final season of the show (so I might as well stick around to see it off), the premiere last Thursday had two great meta moments (everyone throwing trash at Nellie being the highlight for me) that seemed to be the writers acknowledging they've made some mistakes in season 8 and they're gonna make it better.  Let's hope they do a better job with season 9.  Cause with season 8 behind them, there's no other place to go but up.",1,Crash and burn...,1348531200,"09 25, 2012",2012,4451,"['Wow', 'past', 'season', 'Office', 'show', 'quality', 'fell', 'straight', 'cliff.I', ""'m"", 'fine', 'Michael', 'leaving', 'was', 'plenty', 'comedic', 'talent', 'cast', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'show', 'writing', 'was', 'super', 'lazy', 'one', 'seemed', 'have', 'idea', 'where', 'anything', 'was', 'going', 'was', 'most', 'manifest', 'two', 'new', 'characters', 'brought', 'aboard', 'SPOILERS', 'ahead', 'who', 'care', 'James', 'Spader', 'Robert', 'California', 'started', 'out', 'season', '7', 'finale', 'character', 'seemed', 'be', 'either', 'genius', 'con-man', 'making', 'up', 'went', 'along', 'Season', '8', 'seemed', 'writers', 'never', 'figured', 'out', 'what', 'wanted', 'be', 'One', 'episode', 'drunk', 'screwing', 'everything', 'up', 'next', '3', 'steps', 'ahead', 'everyone', 'else', 'Ultimately', 'was', 'managed', 'run', 'company', 'ground', 'yet', 'convince', 'David', 'Wallace', 'give', 'million', 'dollars', 'severance', 'go', 'abroad', 'Europe', 'training', 'teenage', 'gymnasts', 'what', 'had', 'be', 'one', 'dumbest', 'character', 'show', 'ever', 'had', 'mean', 'really', 'David', 'Wallace', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'Robert', 'BS', 'entire', 'office', 'INCLUDING', 'KEVIN', 'can', 'say', 'NOTHING', '.Catherine', 'Tate', 'Nellie', 'Plenty', 'fans', 'hated', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'Personally', 'think', 'character', 'had', 'potential', 'again', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'seemed', 'confidant', 'together', 'Sable', 'store', 'stuff', 'then', 'camera', 'later', 'episode', ""n't"", 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'doing', 'time', 'main', 'office', 'seemed', 'new', 'antagonist', 'Andy', 'episodes', ""'re"", 'trying', 'paint', 'sympathetically', 'give', 'relatable', 'flaws', 'memory', 'box', 'moving', 'episode', 'shopaholic', 'stuff', 'Pam', 'uncovers', 'lame', 'fish-out-of-water', 'taco', 'bit', 'Darryl', 'so', 'supposed', 'be', 'character', 'hate', 'not', 'result', 'was', 'most', 'fans', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'one', 'have', 'idea', 'was', 'actual', 'intention.Some', 'plot', 'threads', 'were', 'introduced', 'just', 'be', 'dropped', 'much', 'development', 'Angela', 'baby', 'possibly', 'gay', 'husband', 'California', 'wife', 'Andy', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'one', 'lady', 'trying', 'get', 'Jim', 'sleep', 'etc', 'seemed', 'were', 'going', 'be', 'somewhat', 'important', 'only', 'surprise', 'not', 'getting', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'introduction', 'many', 'things', 'being', 'wrapped', 'up', 'even', 'have', 'chance', 'begin', 'was', 'writers', 'lit', 'series', 'firecrackers', 'only', 'have', 'single', 'one', 'not', 'go', 'off.Other', 'plot', 'points', 'were', 'just', 'stupid', 'plain', 'simple', ""'ve"", 'already', 'mentioned', 'boneheaded', 'way', 'California', 'was', 'sent', 'off', 'can', 'add', 'Nellie', 'getting', 'Andy', 'job', 'just', 'SITTING', 'IN', 'HIS', 'CHAIR', 'dumbest', 'thing', 'ever', 'happened', 'show', 'was', 'compounded', 'Andy', 'KEEPING', 'HER', 'ON', 'STAFF', 'end', 'constant', 'efforts', 'wreck', 'up', 'til', 'point', 'again', 'including', 'TAKING', 'HIS', 'JOB', 'show', 'already', 'strayed', 'pretty', 'far', 'realistic', 'mockumentary', 'roots', 'kinda', 'stuff', 'so', 'far', 'realm', 'plausibility', 'honestly', 'shocking', 'writers', 'attempted', 'pass', 'off', 'show', 'were', 'other', 'smaller', 'issues', 'too', 'major', 'things', 'compounded', 'unaddressed', 'problems', 'present', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'Jim', 'Pam', 'having', 'nothing', 'really', 'do', 'now', ""'re"", 'married', 'Dwight', 'ever', 'greater', 'transformation', 'living', 'cartoon', 'character', 'make', 'worst', 'year', 'Office', 'ever', 'had.If', 'one', 'star', 'rating', 'little', 'harsh', 'let', 'be', 'known', 'were', 'few', 'chuckle', 'inducing', 'moments', 'Kevin', 'disbelief', 'anyone', 'would', 'put', 'mummy', 'museum', 'was', 'pretty', 'great', 'can', 'always', 'count', 'few', 'great', 'Creed', 'moments', 'hardly', 'worst', 'comedy', 'TV', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'were', '5', 'star', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'were', '3', 'have', 'choice', 'rate', 'season', '1', 'really', 'was', 'bad', 'comparison', 'eveything', 'come', 'it.That', 'said', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'season', '9', 'Not', 'only', 'final', 'season', 'show', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'stick', 'around', 'see', 'off', 'premiere', 'last', 'Thursday', 'had', 'two', 'great', 'meta', 'moments', 'everyone', 'throwing', 'trash', 'Nellie', 'being', 'highlight', 'seemed', 'be', 'writers', 'acknowledging', ""'ve"", 'made', 'mistakes', 'season', '8', ""'re"", 'gon', 'make', 'better', 'Let', 'hope', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'season', '9', 'Cause', 'season', '8', 'other', 'place', 'go', 'up']",The Office: Season Eight

He was hilarious in the season seven finale, but they toned down his character so much, he becomes the very thing he was meant to spoof: being creepy and strange.Secondly, that new girl, Nelly I think, She was terrible. She was very hard to watch and was an absolutely horrible character,  and that's me being nice all right. She got Andy's job by just simply walking in and sitting down in his chair?

I stopped watching it because I knew Steve Carell left the show, and heard this show wasn't as good anymore.But now, I got some extra time and decided to finishing seeing Season 8 and 9 and let this series end for me. Well, I thought season 8, wasn't that bad, in fact, it was good! It wasn't great or excellent because I felt that something was missing. It didn't take me hold and kept me there as it used to. I know Micheal isn't there anymore, but that wasn't it. The series has gone down since the Jim and Pam thing is pretty much died. They're married and have a child, wait make that a child and half. She pregnant and that wasn't really a story that I cared for. Jim has a slight spark interest beside Pam since she left and she give her job to a temp, but Jim was very slight interest in the temp, but clearly he didn't want to do anything with her and I thought that would had made a good story line I could had liked.Other things that happened this season was that Andy became the main character of the story because he is now the manager and the CEO is Robert California. The whole season is about them fighting and working together. Some more things would be that Erin still loves Andy but Andy has another girlfriend, but still likes/loves Aaron as well. That was probably the most interesting thing I liked this season. I didn't really care about the story with Darryl and Val. Dwright wasn't as funny this seaon and the rest of the cast just were there, and weren't that big of a deal anymore.Also, this series introduces Nellie Bertram, the Special Projects Manager. Her story was the second favorite this season. I found her character was quite funny and love how sexy she is. Even though she kind of old, she was she still HOT. lolAll in all, I liked the season. It started out really slow, but as the season continued on, it grew on me. I no longer looked to see if Michael would somehow walked in and say I'm back, but looked to see what would happen next with Andy and Erin.

Andy does a great job too, as well as the other characters. As for Robert California, he didn't bother me after a few episodes.

Then, a transition season (seeing the departure of Steve Carrell) left the show with a very unstable future.  Sadly, the ""circle down the drain"" only continues with this eighth season, producing no redeeming moments whatsoever.This season was lost right from the get-go and never improved one iota.  The additions of James Spader & Catherine Tate to the cast proved to add nothing to the ""Michael Scott void"", while all the other characters begin to really get stale for the first time in the show's now-lengthy run.  Some of the ""lowlights"" of this season (minor spoilers ahead) include...-The complete ruination of the Andy Bernard character and his relationship with Erin.  This was supposed to be the next ""Jim & Pam"" kind of relationship, but it has failed miserably.  The ""Nard Dog"" was once the funniest character on the show.  Now, he is just a shell of his former self.  His character just isn't the ""leading man"" type.-The new additions to the cast also failed to impress and even further muddy the waters of the show's identity.  But, what should have been expected after the failed experiment of the Will Ferrell character in the previous season?-The auxiliary characters are now old and stale.  Whereas their eclectic comments once seemed to never get old, now they are almost cringe-worthy most of the time.The sad fact of the matter is that Michael Scott was the glue that held ""The Office"" together.  With his departure, everything has completely melted down.  I can honestly say that not a single episode of the entire season stood out as ""funny"".  Only Rainn Wilson's Dwight Schrute remains even remotely entertaining (with Jim/Pam now completely played out).I fully expect the show to continue as it is such a big hit for NBC and the network will milk it dry and then some, but I made have to make the tough decision to jump ship before the resolution.  I do not take this decision lightly, as I have invested so much in the Dunder Mifflin-ites, but it has now become a chore to watch each week.  I saw the same thing happen with ""Smallville"" over on the WB/CW network, and it saddens me to realize ""The Office"", which was once so great, will go out with such a whimper.If you are a casual fan of this show and don't necessarily need to ""see the payoff"" in the end, I would actually encourage you to stop watching after the Michael Scott departure episode towards the end of season seven, which could have (and should have, in hindsight) served as the show finale.
