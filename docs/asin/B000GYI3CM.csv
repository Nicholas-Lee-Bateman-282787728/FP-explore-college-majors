1008300,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B000GYI3CM,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[6, 6]","Catherine Cookson was a master storyteller. More of the British television adaptations of some of Cookson's best stories are here on DVD.  Every one of the stories are worth the typical cost of a current running motion picture so this set has a bargain price.  I'd rate any of the 17 movies adapted from Catherine Cookson's books a 5-star; and I have them all.There is usually some violence involved in these Victorian stories as Cookson wrote about the common and poor people of the Victorian era, not the aristocrats. Their life style was much harsher, dirty, and troublesome. Cookson was able to show romance, love, and family value in many of her characters as well. You will get quite a mix of characters, and many will be as unforgettable as the story itself.Cookson almost always wrote of the Newcastle area in NE England and the sets allow you to look back in time and to see the sights for yourself.  And the costumes, so realistic, help set the stage for the delightful stories.  Don't always expect the delightful ending, or the anticipated finale.  Cookson likes to surprise.Warning: Keep this set on the adult shelf. Almost all of the stories, because of the people and region portrayed in the tale, offer segments unacceptable to younger children due to language, sexuality, violence, nudity, and/or content. But the other 97% is ""BANG-ON,"" and ""JOLLY GOOD.""",5,CATHERINE COOKSON STORIES ON FILM ARE GREAT,1225843200,"11 5, 2008",2008,1372,"['Catherine', 'Cookson', 'was', 'master', 'storyteller', 'More', 'British', 'television', 'adaptations', 'Cookson', 'best', 'stories', 'are', 'here', 'DVD', 'Every', 'one', 'stories', 'are', 'typical', 'cost', 'current', 'running', 'motion', 'picture', 'set', 'bargain', 'price', ""'d"", 'rate', '17', 'movies', 'adapted', 'Catherine', 'Cookson', 'books', '5-star', 'have', 'usually', 'violence', 'involved', 'Victorian', 'stories', 'Cookson', 'wrote', 'common', 'poor', 'people', 'Victorian', 'era', 'not', 'aristocrats', 'life', 'style', 'was', 'much', 'harsher', 'dirty', 'troublesome', 'Cookson', 'was', 'able', 'show', 'romance', 'love', 'family', 'value', 'many', 'characters', 'well', 'will', 'get', 'quite', 'mix', 'characters', 'many', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'unforgettable', 'story', 'itself.Cookson', 'almost', 'always', 'wrote', 'Newcastle', 'area', 'NE', 'England', 'sets', 'allow', 'look', 'back', 'time', 'see', 'sights', 'costumes', 'so', 'realistic', 'help', 'set', 'stage', 'delightful', 'stories', 'Do', ""n't"", 'always', 'expect', 'delightful', 'ending', 'anticipated', 'finale', 'Cookson', 'surprise.Warning', 'Keep', 'set', 'adult', 'shelf', 'Almost', 'stories', 'people', 'region', 'portrayed', 'tale', 'offer', 'segments', 'unacceptable', 'younger', 'children', 'due', 'language', 'sexuality', 'violence', 'nudity', 'and/or', 'content', 'other', '97', '%', 'BANG-ON', 'JOLLY', 'GOOD']",The Catherine Cookson Collection: (The Dwelling Place / The Gambling Man / The Glass Virgin / The Man Who Cried)
1008301,AD1F6WG7MFBBU,B000GYI3CM,"homeskoolmom ""homeskoolmom""","[0, 0]",Catherine Cookson has some really good books. I have to say I like the movies better than the books as they are a little hard to get through at times...at least for me.I really liked The Glass Virgin and The Dwelling Place.The Glass Virgin is about a young girl that grows up believing she is the daughter of her parents. When the truth comes out her life changes dramatically. She goes through much hardship with a special friend.The Dwelling Place is again about hardship and making choices. The young girl is raped. Other reviewers have stated the unlikelyhood of her marrying the rapist. I have to disagree to some degree because it was a different time and place then. There are historical accounts of women doing just that and living their lives out together.,4,Some good movies,1301184000,"03 27, 2011",2011,765,"['Catherine', 'Cookson', 'really', 'good', 'books', 'have', 'say', 'movies', 'better', 'books', 'are', 'little', 'hard', 'get', 'times', 'least', 'me.I', 'really', 'liked', 'Glass', 'Virgin', 'Dwelling', 'Place.The', 'Glass', 'Virgin', 'young', 'girl', 'up', 'believing', 'daughter', 'parents', 'When', 'truth', 'out', 'life', 'changes', 'dramatically', 'through', 'much', 'hardship', 'special', 'friend.The', 'Dwelling', 'Place', 'again', 'hardship', 'making', 'choices', 'young', 'girl', 'raped', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'stated', 'unlikelyhood', 'marrying', 'rapist', 'have', 'disagree', 'degree', 'was', 'different', 'time', 'place', 'then', 'are', 'historical', 'accounts', 'women', 'doing', 'just', 'living', 'lives', 'out', 'together']",The Catherine Cookson Collection: (The Dwelling Place / The Gambling Man / The Glass Virgin / The Man Who Cried)
