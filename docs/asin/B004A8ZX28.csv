The man checks his Blackberry. Was a suitcase lost? Can it be recovered? There is an accident and rescue. [Bad luck symbol?] Dr. Martin Harris lives! He can't remember a cell phone number. Four days have passed in a coma. Harris wants to find his wife, but he has lost his passport. He is impatient. ""Do I know you?"" says Liz. There is conflict. [A false note?] The police arrive. They check the Internet for his name. Whose picture is that? [Can you trust the Internet?] Harris leaves the hotel, the makes a telephone call to leave a message. Some man follows him, but he catches a subway train. His taxi driver has disappeared, but he finds her. Next he goes to see that German professor and finds his imposter there.The police arrive to sort things out. Harris is back in the hospital for his memory loss. Another medical test. Something goes very wrong! Who is after him? Harris gets away, he goes to see detective Jurgen (a former member of the Stasi) recommended by Nurse Gretchen. Does he know Liz's past? Ask enough questions and a man may change his story. Harris finds Gina the taxi driver, who is an illegal immigrant. Jurgen does his research on the Biotech Congress. But there is another threat! The intruders play for keeps. But Harris and Gina get away. There is a car chase in the streets that ends in an accident. They find refuge in a night club, both are in danger. Harris decodes a book code message. Prince Shahida supports the work of bio-technical research into food production. They watch a building. Harris watches the man watching Liz. Liz explains she is being watched, they are in danger. Mr. Kohl calls Jurgen for a meeting.Jurgen offers a drink to Mr. Kohl and tells about a secret agency that never fails. Harris and Gina recover his suitcase (ownership is proved by knowing the combination lock). Now Harris has his passport. [Foolish to keep it in a suitcase?] Should they wait in a caf&eacute;? That professor meets Harris. Gina sees the kidnapping. Another car chase for action. ""There is no Martin Harris."" It is a legend made up to get into the convention! ""I'm really, really sorry."" ""Who am I?"" Gina arrives in time to save Harris (and tidy up the loose ends). There is a big surprise in that suitcase! Harris begins to remember the past. He and Gina go to that hotel. Liz drops a tracking device into a professor's bag. The police are on guard. Can a person use a remote device to copy files?Will the police believe Harris and sound an alarm? Dressler was working on a strain of corn that would grow in any climate. Will things work as planned? Yes and no. There is another fight, only one survives. Will there be a happy ending? Dressler announces his donation of this corn to the whole world. [Stocks in agribusiness drop as a result.] Two people with valid passports leave Berlin. [You wonder what will happen to them next.]This story seems like partly from an Alfred Hitchcock movie and from ""The Twilight Zone"". The character of Gina seems derived from that girl with the dragon tattoo. Parts seems incredible. If that secret agency never fails how did Martin survive all those attempts on his life? It is overly complicated for an assassination plot, there are simpler methods (based on the recent news where an Iranian scientist was murdered).

I found this film to be a throw-back to the classic spy genre while also holding on to the early cinematic touches of evil lurking around every corner. The snow spattered world of Berlin Germany is where we enter a Dr. Harris (Neeson), who gets a good bump on the head as his taxi accidentally plunges into an icey body of water. The beautiful German actress Diane Kruger becomes his permanant lifesaver.Hospitalized, he then makes his way through the European streets after a four day coma seeking his wife (January Jones) whom he arrived with. It is then (without much thinking)the premise of the film is set. Dr. Harris is not recognized by his wife and his ID appears to be stolen. Many twists and turns play out with a surprising caldron of excellent actors who solidify the plot. Bruno Ganz plays a stately detective which is a period piece of it's own.""Unknown"" is extremely well filmed with harrowing car chases, relentless murderers and Hitchcockian imagery. Excellent on screen chemistry between Neeson and Kruger as they strive for survival against ruthless killers. An addendem is the German landscape that becomes a viseral peril. When the director bothered to put in a good old museum spy chase, I subconciously had to applaude. Frank Langella, in one the best roles I've seen him, plays badness like he owns it. Add unique flashbacks and some grand explosions for a spy thriller galore.However implausible a storyline, the film is grounded enough to connect the realistic dots. The only slight detractor is the one on one chop/cut style fight scene between Neeson and his enemy toward the end.

E Jackson,"[1, 4]","I wish I could sit here and give Unknown a solid review based on the fact it sounded *extremely* appealing to me based on the description, but sadly -due to the predictable and underwhelming nature of the storyline- the movie slowly sinks to a level of mediocrity as it rolls forward.I mean, really!  It starts off on a REALLY positive note.  While riding a car down a busy city street in Germany, a man (Liam Neeson's character) sinks to the bottom of a lake, hits his head on the car window, and loses his memory.From here, he eventually finds what he believes is his wife at a dinner party, and walks up to her and explains what's going on... unfortunately the woman doesn't recognize him... nor does the man standing next to his wife at the party who mysteriously happens to share the same name as Lian Neeson's character.  Talk about an intriguing way to begin a film!However, it's soon discovered that the plotline doesn't move forward in a suspenseful or interesting kind of way at *all*.  Instead, we're introduced to mediocre car chase segments that we've seen in thousands of other movies, a car falling and crashing from a building after sitting through several more minutes of unsatisfying storytelling, and eventually a bomb explosion that seems more appropriate for a James Bond film.

I sure hope Liam Neeson isn't losing his touch as a fantastic main character in suspense films either- this is the second less than spectacular film I've seen him star in this year (can't remember the other one, but I *did* write a review for it back over the summer).",3,unknown for a reason,1322352000,"11 27, 2011",2011,1972,"['wish', 'could', 'sit', 'here', 'give', 'Unknown', 'solid', 'review', 'based', 'fact', 'sounded', '*extremely*', 'appealing', 'based', 'description', 'sadly', '-due', 'predictable', 'underwhelming', 'nature', 'storyline-', 'movie', 'slowly', 'level', 'mediocrity', 'forward.I', 'mean', 'really', 'REALLY', 'positive', 'note', 'riding', 'car', 'down', 'busy', 'city', 'street', 'Germany', 'man', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'character', 'bottom', 'lake', 'head', 'car', 'window', 'memory.From', 'here', 'eventually', 'what', 'wife', 'dinner', 'party', 'up', 'what', 'going', 'unfortunately', 'woman', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'man', 'standing', 'next', 'wife', 'party', 'who', 'mysteriously', 'share', 'same', 'name', 'Lian', 'Neeson', 'character', 'Talk', 'intriguing', 'way', 'begin', 'film', 'However', 'soon', 'discovered', 'plotline', ""n't"", 'move', 'forward', 'suspenseful', 'interesting', 'kind', 'way', '*all*', 'Instead', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'mediocre', 'car', 'chase', 'segments', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'thousands', 'other', 'movies', 'car', 'falling', 'crashing', 'building', 'sitting', 'several', 'more', 'minutes', 'unsatisfying', 'storytelling', 'eventually', 'bomb', 'explosion', 'more', 'appropriate', 'James', 'Bond', 'film', 'Certainly', 'not', 'plot', 'direction', '*I*', 'was', 'anticipating', 'based', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'memory', 'loss', 'portions', 'movie', 'many', 'eagerly', 'believed', 'would', 'entice', 'never', 'before-', 'least', '*I*', 'did', '.I', 'dunno', 'people', 'might', 'find', 'Unknown', 'appealing', 'disappointingly', 'flawed', 'storyline', 'totally', 'golden', 'opportunity', 'interesting', 'shot', 'something', 'original', 'enticing', 'ask', 'sure', 'hope', 'Liam', 'Neeson', ""n't"", 'losing', 'touch', 'fantastic', 'main', 'character', 'suspense', 'films', 'either-', 'second', 'less', 'spectacular', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'star', 'year', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'other', 'one', '*did*', 'write', 'review', 'back', 'summer']",Unknown

Fifteen years ago, Harrison Ford could have seamlessly shifted into this role and done a good job with it. That is probably the biggest fault in this film: the character doesn't seem like Liam until the very end. After the huge success of ""Taken"" (just about any guy you talk to will tell you it's in their list of favorite films), he had set himself up as this brooding action character. More subdued yet brutal than Jason Statham, he could have easily stepped into any action role at this point as the quiet killer and made the movie his. Unfortunately, in this film he is not playing the trained killer so much as the helpless victim trying to get his life back.Don't get me wrong, after the plot twist at the end of the film, it gets really good and reminds you why you came to see the film. The problem is getting to that point. If the plot twist had occurred an hour into the movie to give you 45 minutes of Liam being cool, I could have enjoyed it more. Likewise, a character actor like Harrison Ford (in his day) could have made this a good film. Instead, I kept waiting for Liam to break some bad guy's bones like ""Taken"", and it was just a very long time coming. I found myself looking at my watch several times into the film.It's not really the movie goer's fault for expecting this action. The trailers for the film make it look like a follow-up to ""Taken"" (or at least in the same action vein) and even the movie poster gives us a gun-toting Liam looking ready to kill...and instead we get this Hitchcockian thriller with a little action at the end.

For Americans that's probably the closest thing to Hell on Earth, right up there with being denied Monday Night Football in Hi-Def. (Just kidding) A few films have similar premises of an American being a fish out of his own waters: ""the Bourne Identity"", ""Frantic"", and ""Seven Days Seven Nights"". Hollywood is also replete with stories about people either losing their memories or simply being ""lost"" inside a political situation because of forces beyond their control, such as ""the Changeling"", Hitchcock's ""Spellbound"", ""the Truman Show""; even ""Total Recall"" and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" have similarities.The one element that saves these movies is the premise of the main character being in essentially a ""no win situation"". Despite how contrived or ""unrealistic"" the whole plot is, if the character is interesting enough, and the situation compelling enough, then you tend to run with it. Part of the fun is learning the greater story along with the character. It may have become a rather over-used plot devise, but it tends to work, in part because pieces of the puzzle can be thrown at the character without him understanding what it means.""Unknown"" falls into this category of a character being trapped in a situation he does not completely understand, and the story is told almost entirely from the his point of view. After a near-death experience in Berlin, an American wakes up in a hospital room and his only knowledge is that he is Dr Martin Harris and he was there for a Biotech conference. But he has lost his identification along the way, and no one seems to believe him. He even returns to the hotel where he was supposed to be staying and finds his wife. Except his wife not only denies him but appears to be married to a man also by the name of Dr Martin Harris. Will the real Martin Harris please stand up? Starts to ring of a suspense version of the old television show ""To Tell the Truth"" where three people would claim they were the same person, and panelists would try to figure out who was the ""real"" person.I don't see ""and the nominees for Best Actor are Liam Neeson for Uknown"" in the near future, but at the same time it really is Neeson who makes the entire film work. His honesty as an actor delivers a performance right on the money that kept me on the edge of my seat most of the way, to the point where I really wanted to know how he would get out of this. I never quite fell out of my chair, the way I did when I saw the original ""the Bourne Identity"" with Richard Chamberlain, but ""Unknown"" is first-rate entertainment of the escapist variety.The two leading ladies also keep the entertainment level high, particularly January Jones (of Mad Men fame) who plays against type, as the loyal wife turned traitor.

1392607,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B004A8ZX28,C. Sawin,"[4, 7]","THIS DOES CONTAIN SOME HEAVY SPOILERS IN THE LAST TWO PARAGRAPHSI'm just going to say what everyone is probably thinking, Unknown looks like the indirect sequel to Taken. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing on paper, it is kind of unnecessary given that a Taken sequel is currently in development. While Liam Neeson used to be the go to actor to portray a mentor or father figure that would die early on in whatever film he was a part of (Star Wars: Episode I, Gangs of New York, Kingdom of Heaven, Batman Begins, and The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, just to name a few), Taken seemed to break that mold. But now it seems like Neeson is drawn to roles similar to the one he had in Taken since the film was such a surprise success. At the end of the day, however, Unknown is definitely its own film with obvious similarities to Taken.The biggest difference between Taken and Unknown is that element of mystery in Unknown. For the first three quarters of the film, you're trying to figure out who the real Dr. Martin Harris really is. And when it's finally revealed, it's actually a surprisingly decent twist. Taken also had much more action than Unknown mostly in part to Liam Neeson completely owning anyone that stood in his way of finding his daughter. While Unknown has its exciting moments, it's more thrilling than anything. It's all mostly car chases and Martin running away from people trying to kill him. While there is a scuffle or two involving Neeson beforehand, his only real fight similar to anything in Taken is the one in the finale (the ""I didn't forget everything,"" scene). While this may sound disappointing, it's really not and gives Unknown a few more distinguishing features to seem less like a doppelganger of a film you've already seen.The cast is pretty strong all around. Liam Neeson doesn't disappoint and is just as strong as he was in Taken. Diane Kruger manages to outshine January Jones, but that's mostly due to Kruger having more screen time and doing more besides saying she doesn't know her husband. Frank Langella is worth talking about though. Ever since Frost/Nixon, Langella seems to have stuck to smaller roles (where he also usually winds up dying). It's just a shame since Langella usually steals scenes in whatever film he's a part of and you generally want his character to be around longer than he is. On the bright side though, at least he doesn't take it upon himself to choose characters that you wouldn't want around at all.Unknown isn't what it could it have been though. Despite its flaws, it was actually incredibly entertaining and extremely exciting up until the last fifteen minutes or so. Then it's like they decided to throw logic out the window. THESE ARE SOME VERY HEAVY SPOILERS THAT LIE AHEAD, SO IF YOU DON'T WANT THE ENTIRE FILM SPOILED I SUGGEST YOU STOP READING HERE. The original twist is fairly original; Martin is actually an assassin that was sent to Berlin on a mission, hit his head in the car crash, and wound up believing he was the fake identity he took on for the job. That's fine, but when he decides to grow a conscience and save the day is when it seems kinda hokey. Considering the payoff for the whole thing is fast growing corn, the film winds up coming off like a bad joke rather than an exhilarating two hours. Also, it can't really be that easy to obtain passports, can it?Unknown starts off as a pretty intense thriller with teeth grinding car chases and knucklebiting action sequences across rooftops and parking lots, but all of the good things Unknown has going for it are thrown away during its final minutes. Instead we're going to give a bleeding heart to a guy who originally started as a villain and end the world's hunger problems in a two minute video montage. Unknown may look like an action packed film you've seen before, but it actually isn't anywhere near as good as Taken is. If you liked Taken, Unknown is still worth giving a shot.

After leaving the airport, the couple is just outside a luxury hotel when Harris realizes that he is missing a briefcase, which must be very important.  He finds himself momentarily separated from his wife, seconds count, and the briefcase is most likely at the airport. So, Harris jumps into a taxi (conveniently) driven by a beautiful, resourceful, tough, compassionate, illegal immigrant, Gina (Diane Kruger).

If you've seen any espionage film, you'll know the basic premise (including the ""twist"") from the trailer alone.  This knowledge of previous story lines ruins any of the film's suspense; you know how it's going to go, and all you can do is sit there and let director Jaume Collet-Serra drive you around for a couple hours.  (NOTE: I did not call this an ""action"" film, because there is very little action until the last two-thirds; this is not TAKEN, despite what the marketing campaign would have you believe, and if you go into it like that you will be even more disappointed than normal.)That's not to say the film is without any redeeming features (there are two stars in this review, after all).  The story is trite: man loses his identity, struggles to prove he is who he says he is.  Way too many plot-holes here; part of the fun in watching the film is picking all of them out.  Aside from January Jones, who gives an utterly wooden performance as (maybe/maybe not) Mrs. Liam Neeson, the performances are decently solid.  Neeson himself has done way, way better, but he's still a strong presence (he CAN give a bad performance, but he rarely does).  Aidan Quinn, as Neeson's possible replacement, is dangerously charming--is he hiding something or isn't he?  Diane Kruger is the anchor of the lead cast here; she seems to know what kind of film she's making, and decides to walk an even balance between hamming it up and keeping things serious.  As for the more supporting cast, kudos to Frank Langella and Bruno Ganz, who share a tremendously understated scene together; seriously, rent the movie for this one scene alone, and watch it repeatedly.  Especially for those of you wannabe actors who are curious as to how two older men can completely and thoroughly steal a movie in just five minutes.The script is predictable and the directing is inconsequential.  You've seen better espionage films; this is BOURNE-lite, so lite that it's pretty much water with a little sugar added.  If you go into it without any great expectations, perhaps you'll be okay; but as it is, this film is a C-grade thriller at best, passable but utterly forgettable.

That's basically the plot of this nifty little thriller starring Liam Neeson and a very good supporting cast which includes Aideen Quinn, Frank Langella, Diane Kruger and German veteran actor, Bruno Ganz. In fact the pivotal scene between Langella and Ganz threw me for a loop because it was so well acted and written which is unusual for a action movie of this type since good dialogue is usually not a hallmark of action movies.  The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 is because January Jones as Neeson's wife was quite wooden and stiff in her role but perhaps that's why she was chosen since as the plot unravels we begin to understand her role more fully in the movie.

Arriving at the hotel where he is to give his lecture, Martin realizes he had left his brief case at the airport. Martin quickly hopes in the first taxi he sees to retrieve the brief case. On the way back to the airport Martin is involved in car accident. Martin awakens four days later with little recollection of what had happened to him. Martin heads back to the hotel to rejoin his wife to find that someone else had taken his identity. Martin now must prove who he is and unravel the mystery of what had happen and why someone has stolen his identity. Martin recruits the taxi driver that saved his life in their accident and starts to unravel a story that has many twists and turns along the way.Unknown bolts onto blu-ray with a beautiful 1080p/AVC-encoded transfer. The images are clear defined. Each pore on all the thespians is seen with distinct clearness. Each hair follicle is shown with beauty and detail. Unknown's video transfer will easily satisfy the biggest videophiles to the casual observer. Warner Brothers does a top notch five star transfer with Unknown that will in the end gratify the viewer.Equally impressive as Unknown's video quality is Unknown's audio quality. Sorting a beautiful DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround soundtrack, Unknown explodes onto blu-ray. The movie comes to life with its action scenes of car chases, one on one combat, to simple dialogue. No clouding in any scene nor is any dialogue muffled by music or drowned out by action sequences. Audiophiles will salivate as much as videophiles with this five star rating transfer.The most disappointing about Unknown is the special features or I should say lack of special features. The one I am reviewing comes with a DVD/Digital Copy disc and two small featurettes (Liam Neeson: Known Action Star and Unknown: What is Known.). There is no real difference in the featurettes as they both run four and half minutes and talk mostly about the film's star, Liam Neeson. Warner Brothers should have offered the viewer some deleted and alternate scenes and disc commentary. For the disc commentary I would have loved a director's commentary and one with the stars of the film, especially Liam Neeson and the person who plays his replacement in the film Aidan Quinn.Unknown is a well paced thriller. The main gripe both critics and patrons have of Unknown is that Unknown is not Taken 2, that is a good thing. In Taken, the plot and the story is laid out for you in the first thirty minutes of the film. For Unknown, the plot is paced throughout the movie and unlike Taken; Unknown has many twists and turns in the film. Unknown is well acted and paced phenomenally. If you go in expecting Taken, the viewer will be disappointed. If you go in with a clear mind, the viewer will be satisfied. This maybe one of those movies you need to see multiple times to appreciate the movies true value.

Involved in an auto accident causing a head injury further causing amnesia, Martin only has fleeting recollections of his past, and--gasp!--his own wife doesn't recognize him, and what's more--triple gasp!--someone else is pretending to be him!  Accordingly Martin goes about tearing up Germany as he attempts to get to the bottom of this diabolical dilemma, accompanied by an unwilling cab driver (Diane Kruger).  So we have contrived, melodramatic, and zany moments, culminating in Martin fully recovering his memory when it's time to kick some serious arse.

1392630,AHPV4F8IVSC39,B004A8ZX28,"Douglas B. Moran ""Computer+History/Politics""","[8, 15]","It takes a really bad movie to make Liam Neeson boring, and this is such a movie. The plot is a collection of blatant ripoffs from other movies that were mindlessly cobbled together. In this category of movie, the ""MacGuffins"" (or plot coupons) don't need to make a lot of sense because the action and pacing is _supposed_ to pull the viewers along, and not let them recognize that it is a MacGuffin, much less linger on it. This movie fails in both regards. First, the MacGuffins are so in-your-face preposterous that I couldn't not think about them. Second, the slow pacing of the movie didn't give me the opportunity to ignore how preposterous they were. Third, the action sequences are boring because they are mundane technically and I had no investment in any of the characters or in the story.Liam Neeson's performance most of the time feels like a reading during a walk-thru (possibly one to determine why a scene isn't working). A photo of January Jones (the wife, third-billed) seems to have more on-screen time than the actress herself, and even when she is on-screen, the script and director seem to use her as little more than a mannequin. Diane Kruger (second-billed) gives a much more animated performance, but the script has her character as such an incoherent combination of parts that it comes across as ""sound and fury, signifying nothing"".The preposterousness of the plot is hard to even partially explain without spoilers, but here's what I can say: The impetus for the whole story is Neeson's character leaving his briefcase at the airport, something that that character would _never_ have done. When he comes out of a coma four days after an accident, he finds that no one came to the hospital looking for him. Whether he is the real Dr. Martin Harris, an impostor, or something else, I could not conceive of any circumstance where he would not have been missed and someone would have tried to find him, and succeeded. When what is really happening is finally revealed, it only confirms how preposterous this MacGuffin was. Similarly, the bad guys attempting to kill him makes absolutely no sense from their perspective, and it is there simply to enable various chases and fights.The two Dr. Martin Harrises are impossibly perfect in their identical knowledge of events and trivia. Not just far, far more than the plots requires, but detrimental to the plot. And preposterous relative to what the viewer eventually learns.The best example of the how lazy and ill-conceived the script is can be seen in the coded message MacGuffin: The message is something that could have been trivially memorized. Even if there were some reason to write it down, it would have drawn no attention as clear text. In fact, the only purpose of the trivial encoding is to draw the attention of the characters to that information and its importance.The MacGuffin of none of Dr. Harris' scientific collaborators being able to identify him is a ""homage"" to the 1920s and 1930s when long-distance travel was difficult and expensive.  The update is inconsistent. He talks with the collaborators on the phone, but doesn't use video chat -- an international collaboration is more likely to use Skype than traditional telephony.

What's worse, there is another man there who has assumed his identity. What's going on? And why?This interesting film stars Liam Neeson with co-stars Diane Kruger, January Jones, and Aidan Quinn  with supporting roles by Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella.Irish actor Liam Neeson (1952) is best known for his role in ""Schindler's List"" and as Qui-Gon Jinn in ""Star Wars"". A veteran of 80+ films, he was nominated for an Oscar, Golden Globe and a BAFTA for ""Schindler's List"" (1993) and a Golden Globe for ""Michael Collins"" (1996) and ""Kinsey"" (2004). Recently he has been in several films as an action hero - ""Taken"" (2008), ""The A Team"" (2010), ""The Next 3 Days"" (2010) - and this film is part of that transition.You'll recognize Diane Kruger (1976) from her terrific role as Bridget from ""Inglorious Bastards"" (2009) and from her co-starring role in ""National Treasure"" (2004). She plays a taxi driver who gets involved helping Neeson.January Jones (1978) plays Neeson's wife. She's best known for her award nominated performances in ""Mad Men"" and as Emma Frost from ""X Men - First Class"" (2011).Irish actor Aidan Quinn (1959) plays the other man. Quinn is a veteran of more than 50 films and as many TV appearances. He was nominated for an Emmy for his work on ""Bury My Heart a Wounded Knee"" (2007) and ""Early Frost"" (1985).Frank Langella (1938) appears briefly near the end of the film, and is the key to the film's resolution.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[4, 4]","UNKNOWN (2011, 113 minutes) is a satisfying enough spy/actioner starring Liam Neeson as ""Dr. Martin Harris"" - I put quotes because there is no sense pretending it will spoil anything to reveal that is not this unnamed character's real name.In Berlin, Dr. Harris and his silly wife (January Jones) get separated and he ends up comatose after a car wreck. When he awakens, he recalls who he is, and of course no one can seem to confirm he's Dr. Martin Harris ... because he isn't. Someone has already stepped in to replace his identity (Aidann Quinn in what amounts to a cameo) and is running about with his wife.Dr. Harris then goes to seek the help of someone I do not understand fully, a former Stasi officer tunred private detective (Bruno Ganz). The fellow gets a good vibe from Harris and really does his homework. The remainder of the story I will leave to you to discover. While a bit hollow and finally meaningless, this film did present to me a great ethical hypothesis: if a spy developed amnesia that gradually faded, and in the interim thought he was really the cover ID he had invented, would it change him once he'd regained his memory in full?The film leaves no question about it. It is clear Dr. Harris wants to be Dr. Harris, not a CIA assassin. He will have to learn to live with that, and I find that is just about the only value this film has - aside from seeing Neeson which is a delight for me. I realize Neeson is a bad actor and will never be rid of his stilted, wooden delivery of lines. What do you expect from a man who used to be a forklift operator and amateur boxer!I was far more impressed with Neeson's brilliant turn inTaken(see my review) which storyline slightly resembles this because Neeson plays the same generic character.

It's certainly intriguing to begin with and there are a couple of genuinely tense scenes (the bit with the scissors in particular had me on the edge of my seat). Ultimately, however, the plot relies of a series of implausibilities (would Harris really rush back to the airport without uttering a single word to his wife?) and I found the denouement unsatisfying.There's also a rather gratuitous sex-in-the-shower scene that's repeated like a motif throughout. And do we really need to see Liam Neeson with a wife who is so much younger?Finally, if you know Berlin well you'll be utterly bemused by the continuity and how the film jumps around locations seemingly at random.

The viewer can just marvel at the skill, expertise and emotion that are rarely seen in action-packed movies.In all, ""Unknown"" is entertainment at its best.",5,Entertainment at its best with an impressive supprting performance by Bruno Ganz,1304208000,"05 1, 2011",2011,958,"['Unknown', 'professional', 'thriller', 'intriguing', 'storytelling', 'intense', 'high', 'tension', 'actions', 'scenes', 'speedy', 'car', 'chases', 'beautiful', 'Berlin', 'one', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'actor', 'rest.In', 'special', 'case', 'even', 'short', 'plot', 'summery', 'might', 'ruin', 'experience.What', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'story', 'efforts', 'Dr.', 'Martin', 'Harris', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'reclaim', 'life', 'being', 'involved', 'car', 'accident', 'difficulties', 'doing', 'so.In', 'process', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'try', 'help', 'one', 'Ernst', 'J', 'uuml', 'played', 'Bruno', 'Ganz', 'who', 'short', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performance', 'Ganz', 'character', 'veteran', 'Stasi', 'operative', 'now', 'detective', 'hire', 'who', 'steal', 'scene', 'part', 'viewer', 'can', 'just', 'marvel', 'skill', 'expertise', 'emotion', 'are', 'rarely', 'seen', 'action-packed', 'movies.In', 'Unknown', 'entertainment', 'best']",Unknown

1392648,A2BPDFR58H9575,B004A8ZX28,Galina,"[7, 10]","************This review contains spoilers***********If you liked the movie ""Taken""(2008) with Liam Neeson as a former CIA operative saving his daughter in France from the mafia that kidnaps the girls and forced them into prostitution, you should like the new movie Unknown (2011) with Neeson in the title role of an American scientist, Dr. Martin Harris, who arrived  with his young beautiful wife Beth (January Jones) in Berlin to give a speech on the biotechnology summit. Just minutes after arrival, Dr. Harris fell into a coma as a result of  a car accident and after four days of coma awaking in a Berlin hospital, he found out that no one, including his own wife does not recognize him, and that his identity and his all life was taken by another person with the same name. If you are a fan of Neeson - the film should appeal to you. Neeson has tremendous screen presence and charisma.  Looks like age is no obstacle to him. The cast also includes two beautiful actresses, January Jones and Diane Kruger. The scene between two veteran actors, Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella elevates the film above its genre. If you are a fan of the twisted thriller / mystery / action / suspense, and not just one but double or even triple twists and turns, you should not read this but run and watch the movie. :)  Seriously, it is exciting, gripping and suspenseful film. It seemed predictable in the beginning but it surprised me with its revelations in the final part. I think the first film in what may become the series, ""Leam Neeson's dangerous adventures in Europe"", Taken is better because I truly rooted for Bryan/Neeson. Taken's twists and turns concerned more the identities of the ""bad guys"", and as questionable Bryan's actions were, I always wanted him to succeed and find his daughter before it was too late. Unknown is morally ambiguous. I think the title is very appropriate with the constant developments of the character as his memory of the events before his accident began coming back but the movie's got too many holes in the plot to make as convincing case for Dr. Harris as it was for Bryan Mills.*****************Major Spoilers. Don't read if you did not see the film. ***********************************Unknown makes you think that perhaps bumping one's head and felling into coma could actually help to clear the head in reality and to cure the very dangerous terrorists by changing their outlook completely. Unknown also suggests that no matter how carefully and thoroughly you plan the major secret operation, thinking that you predicted and backed up everything and everybody, there is always something you'd overlook or simply could not fathom.***************End of Spoilers****************************************************************************As its predecessor Taken, Unknown is enjoyable action/thrillers/mystery.

1392657,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004A8ZX28,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","UNKNOWN is. Many aspects of this cerebral suspense thriller are given to the audience in snippets - bits and pieces that involves the audience in keeping up with the ever-changing story line or simply throws everybody for a loop - especially the ending.  Adapted from the novel 'Out of my Head' by Didier Van Cauwelaert and molded into a screenplay by Oliver Butcher and Stephen Cornwell this film needs a  seasoned director to make it work: Jaume Collet-Serra isn't quite there yet.American Biotechnologist Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) arrives in Berlin with his wife Liz (January Jones) for an important world conference to unveil a newly developed failsafe corn developed by Professor Bressler (Sebastian Koch) and underwritten by Prince Shada (Mido Hamada).  But once at the hotel Matin realizes he left his briefcase at the airport and while Liz checks in he grabs a taxi driven by Bosnian immigrant Gina (Diane Kruger): in an attempt to race against time the taxi is in an accident and plunges into the river - Gina escapes the underwater car and saves Martin's life.  Martin is comatosed in a hospital for four days attended by Dr. Farge (Karl Markovics) and wise nurse Gretchen (Eva L&ouml;bau) and when he awakens he has memory loss: he remembers his name and begins to piece together the events that brought him to the hospital, remembering that his wife Liz may be worried about him. He leaves AMA and begins a journey that proves to be a long one - his identity has been stolen by another man who claims to be  Martin (Aidan Quinn) and Liz claims she doesn't know her own husband.  Without identification and desperate for answers martin finds Gina who pledges to help him, supplying Martin with the name of an ex-Stasi spy Ernst J&uuml;rgen (Bruno Ganz) who helps Martin paste together his identity.  But the trouble has just begun as Martin finds himself being chased by a group of thugs (Olivier Schneider and Stipe Erceg), and Gina is helpful but in the middle of the situation with her dear colleague Biko (Clint Dyer) also in danger.  Even the appearance of martins old friend Rodney Cole (Frank Langella ) doesn't aid Martin's quest for regaining his complete memory until a jarring turn of events introduces a whole new explanation for the strange plot that is so full of twists it almost sinks from its own weight.The cast is strong and Liam Neeson again proves that characters such as this fit perfectly into his charismatic macho appearance.  The other reliable pros - Diane Kruger, Sebastian Koch and Bruno Ganz - add credibility to their roles and there are many relatively new faces that seem to show great promise in screen presence.

1392658,A1S1JC7LTBZAH2,B004A8ZX28,Hal Jordan,"[3, 6]","This film did not do particularly well at the box office, so I was expecting a weak effort intended to cash in on the success Liam Neeson enjoyed in Taken.  I was pleasantly surprised that the film was actually quite good.  I was afraid that the resolution of the basic mystery was going to be far-fetched, as in the Jodie Foster film Flight Plan.  In fact, though, the resolution was quite satisfying.[SPOILER ALERT]  It is true, though, as other reviewers have noted, that the film bears a strong resemblance to the Bourne Identity.  I have to say that it is not nearly as good as that film, but not bad on its own terms.  There are a few plot holes, however.  How plausible is it that the scientist who invents a new super strain of corn has all the information contained on the hard drive of his laptop, so that by killing him the bad guys keep the strain from being used?  The scientist is shown running a large lab and none of his research assistants have the information?  It's not kept on the labs computers?  Why be so secretive when he intends to give the strain away, rather than patent it?  In addition, the usual Hollywood paranoia about big business is in full play.  Somehow, I doubt any new strain of any crop would sweep the world in a way that would damage ""agribusiness"" significantly.  It also seemed a bit implausible that the January Jones character would go back to try to disarm the bomb.  She is apparently afraid of being identified, but wouldn't that also have been a problem if the original plan had come off?  Finally, when the ex-Stasi agent who is helping Liam Neeson, realizes one of the bad guys is coming to kill him, he commits suicide rather than shooting the bad guy.  Seems a bit weak.

After arriving at his hotel, he realizes that he left his briefcase with all his papers at the airport and leaves his wife to check in while he goes to retrieve it. There is an accident & he wakes up in a hospital after four days in a coma. He returns to the hotel where, not only does his wife not recognize him, but she's in the company of another man (a near cameo by Aidan Quinn) who says that HE is Martin Harris. With no identification & still nursing a head injury, he tries to piece together his past, while in his present, he is being pursued by vicious thugs intent on killing him. The only link to his recent past who can prove he's not insane is the cab driver who was involved in the accident with him (Diane Kruger).

Bourne has already done all that in Berlin, Moscow, London, Paris, Hong Kong or Shanghai, and a good twenty more touristic destinations. This one is touched by some nostalgia with a special focus on East Berlin. Friedrichstrasse Bahnhof, the entering station of East Berlin, a little bit of Unter den Linden, next door, and then the Brandenburg Tor on the East side essentially, the East German TV tower on Alexandra Platz, the Hohenzollern Palace' rebuilt after the fall of the wall, and an ex-Stasi agent, and some survivors of the Cold War, terrorist style from the West. We just miss the Karl Marx Allee and the Vopos [Volkspolizei for the younger generation who never met them] of course. I guess East Berlin is cheaper for film makers than West Berlin. Then the whole thing is wrapped up in some kind of nice pieces of ideological good will. The Stasi commits suicide on the screen. The brutal Serbs are killed one by one and one after another. The Arab prince is a nice-looking nearly Caucasian young chap and he is supporting western science. The scientists are developing a new type of maize that will grow in the desert and will kill all insects five hundred miles around and the NGOs are even said (or is it told?) to approve it, and it is true the ecological zombies have been made scarce. The only negative point is that the terrorists are plain criminal hit men paid by the agricultural industry to kill the scientist and steal his files. And all that goes down the chute because of a weirdo professional killer who loses his memory and his mind. Superb! Well, people my age can always get some kicks out of the little bits of East Berlin they remember when the Stasi was everywhere.

There wasn't anything that interested me until UNKNOWN. It looked like it would be a good action/suspense movie but I was wrong. I'll be blunt this movie was pretty boring. It's kind of reminds me of The American with George Clooney. It had potential but failed to rise above ordinary to bad.The story follows Dr. Martin Harris(Liam Neeson) and Elizabeth Harris(January Jones) who have arrived in Berlin for a conference. Things are going well for them until Martin gets into a accident. When he awakes he finds out there's someone else has taken over his life and impersonating him. Things go from bad to worse when he tries to prove who he is. The overall story isn't very good a plot to assassinate someone at the conference. The intriguing part is Martin. Is he really Martin Harris or is the other Martin the real one. The payoff worked well when you find out who he really is. The problem with the story is the pacing and the editing of the story. How many minutes were wasted with Martin just wandering the streets. I mean it must have been ten minutes. Then there was the action which was few an far between and outside of one good scene was bad. Then there was the ending which planned sucked.The acting was what hurt the movie the most. All the lead actors seemed to be on autopilot through this movie. Liam Neeson did a ok job. There were times he did a great job and there were others he seemed to be on autopilot. Aidan Quinn and January Jones seemed like zombies. The only one of the leads that showed any real emotion was Diana Kruger(Gina). Because of the bad acting you or at least I ended up not caring one bit about any of them. Oh one of them died all well who cares and you move one. The actor who stole the show and the film was a supporting actor. His name is Bruno Ganz. I had never heard of him before. He plays Ernst J&uuml;rgen a ex Stasi(The East German State Security) officer. His character is the most intriguing and surprisingly the most likable. Ernst is also in the best scene in the movie. Where he is at his home with Rodney Cole(Frank Langella). This two veteran actors do a superb job but again Bruno is the one that shines. To be honest I wish the made the movie about his character.Now back to the action that was hard to find. The fight scenes weren't very well done. The climax in a hotel was done terribly. Maybe the director wanted to rely on the mystery and suspense but those two weren't good enough make this a good movie. I don't mind movies with out a long of action but when there is it had better be good. The only really great action scene in the near midway part of the film where there is a car chase in the streets of Berlin which I thought was really well done.As for directing by Jaume Collet-Serra was bad. Which I guess shouldn't be surprising once I found out who he was and what he directed before. He's only directed four movies and the only one I know about or seen is the god awful HOUSE OF WAX. I wish the movie studio had found someone else to direct this movie maybe then it would have been better.Overall a below average to bad action/suspense movie that I'd skip if I were you.,2,It's simply not a good movie.,1307145600,"06 4, 2011",2011,3257,"['Warning', 'might', 'be', 'spoilers', 'ahead', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'just', 'two', 'months', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'interested', 'UNKNOWN', 'looked', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'action/suspense', 'movie', 'was', 'wrong', ""'ll"", 'be', 'blunt', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'boring', 'kind', 'reminds', 'American', 'George', 'Clooney', 'had', 'potential', 'failed', 'rise', 'above', 'ordinary', 'bad.The', 'story', 'Dr.', 'Martin', 'Harris', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Elizabeth', 'Harris', 'January', 'Jones', 'who', 'have', 'arrived', 'Berlin', 'conference', 'Things', 'are', 'going', 'well', 'Martin', 'accident', 'When', 'out', 'someone', 'else', 'taken', 'over', 'life', 'impersonating', 'Things', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'when', 'prove', 'who', 'overall', 'story', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'plot', 'assassinate', 'someone', 'conference', 'intriguing', 'part', 'Martin', 'really', 'Martin', 'Harris', 'other', 'Martin', 'real', 'one', 'payoff', 'worked', 'well', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'really', 'problem', 'story', 'pacing', 'editing', 'story', 'How', 'many', 'minutes', 'were', 'wasted', 'Martin', 'just', 'wandering', 'streets', 'mean', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'ten', 'minutes', 'Then', 'was', 'action', 'was', 'few', 'far', 'one', 'good', 'scene', 'was', 'bad', 'Then', 'was', 'ending', 'planned', 'sucked.The', 'acting', 'was', 'what', 'hurt', 'movie', 'most', 'lead', 'actors', 'seemed', 'be', 'autopilot', 'movie', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'did', 'ok', 'job', 'were', 'times', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'were', 'others', 'seemed', 'be', 'autopilot', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'January', 'Jones', 'seemed', 'zombies', 'only', 'one', 'leads', 'showed', 'real', 'emotion', 'was', 'Diana', 'Kruger', 'Gina', 'bad', 'acting', 'least', 'ended', 'up', 'not', 'caring', 'one', 'bit', 'Oh', 'one', 'died', 'well', 'who', 'move', 'one', 'actor', 'who', 'stole', 'show', 'film', 'was', 'supporting', 'actor', 'name', 'Bruno', 'Ganz', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'before', 'Ernst', 'J', 'uuml', 'rgen', 'ex', 'Stasi', 'East', 'German', 'State', 'Security', 'officer', 'character', 'most', 'intriguing', 'surprisingly', 'most', 'likable', 'Ernst', 'also', 'best', 'scene', 'movie', 'Where', 'home', 'Rodney', 'Cole', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'two', 'veteran', 'actors', 'do', 'superb', 'job', 'again', 'Bruno', 'one', 'be', 'honest', 'wish', 'made', 'movie', 'character.Now', 'back', 'action', 'was', 'hard', 'find', 'fight', 'scenes', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'well', 'done', 'climax', 'hotel', 'was', 'done', 'terribly', 'Maybe', 'director', 'wanted', 'rely', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'two', 'were', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'movies', 'out', 'long', 'action', 'when', 'had', 'better', 'be', 'good', 'only', 'really', 'great', 'action', 'scene', 'near', 'midway', 'part', 'film', 'where', 'car', 'chase', 'streets', 'Berlin', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'well', 'done.As', 'directing', 'Jaume', 'Collet-Serra', 'was', 'bad', 'Which', 'guess', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprising', 'once', 'found', 'out', 'who', 'was', 'what', 'directed', 'before', 'only', 'directed', 'four', 'movies', 'only', 'one', 'know', 'seen', 'god', 'awful', 'HOUSE', 'OF', 'WAX', 'wish', 'movie', 'studio', 'had', 'found', 'someone', 'else', 'direct', 'movie', 'maybe', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'below', 'average', 'bad', 'action/suspense', 'movie', ""'d"", 'skip', 'were']",Unknown

I even enjoyed it close to the end when the truth about Neeson's character (Dr. Martin Harris, in Berlin for a biotechnology conference) comes out, up until the rationale and justification for all this sturm and drang occurs.  Then I got disgusted with the Hollywood agenda.  But more on that at the end of THIS review.Dr. Martin Harris, in Berlin with his wife, is in an auto accident in a taxi, nearly dies, and comes out of a coma.  At that point he's ""unknown.""  His wife doesn't know him any more and she's with another guy who is Dr. Martin Harris (played by Aiden Quinn), who has all the proper papers!  Neeson's character has absolutely zero papers to prove he is really Dr. Harris.  He then starts running all over Berlin trying to figure out who he is and avoid getting killed by some shady ruthless guys.  The plot is full of suspense and fear.  I like the ""Urban Euro feel"" to the movie when Harris, played well by Neeson, befriends Gina the taxi driver (who is an illegal immigrant from Eastern Europe) and runs all over Berlin trying to figure things out and avoiding the bad guys.  He runs into a former member of the Stasi (E. German secret police), which only makes the confusion worse and the action more lethal.  While some may find the movie plot cliched, I liked it and I was rather surprised when I learned the truth near the end, when Dr. Martin Harris finds out who he really is.(Spoiler alert below!)OK, now my rant and the part that I hate:  THE CLICHED HOLLYWOOD POLITICAL AGENDA, which comes out at the end.  It's in way, way too many movies!  You see, corporations are evil, because they are greedy sociopathic money makers and they'll kill to get their money, according to Hollywood.  Just look at ""The Island"" (where evil corporations make clones for body parts for evil rich), or ""The Runaway Jury"".  Maybe the Hwood producers are projecting their own jerkiness on to other corporations, I don't know, but this movie falls into this stupid, false and cliched political agenda at the end.  You see, all the action and killing in the movie is due to ....... Corporations knowing that their profits will go down when a scientist wants to donate the formula for revolutionary bio-engineered corn to the world!!  So they'll murder people to keep up their profits!???  This is such BS and it's so typical of Hollywood films.  You mean to tell me that a charitable scientist, funded by a Arab Prince, is going to help the world with his FREE invention, and thus is targeted by assassination by .... corporations???  You the reader, how many Fortune 500 corporations do you know that directly pay assassins to knock off their competitors (and saying that criminal drug cartels are part of the Fortune 500 is cheating)?  Try ZERO.  That's because they are run by people who either are mostly good, or at least do not want to go to jail.  The premise of Unknown just doesn't ring true.Look at the world's organized killings & bombings -- a high percent by Islamic terrorists, a high percent by Mafiosias and Drug gangs, and perhaps another big chunk by Communists & dictators; and some in war zones.  But Islamic terrorists and Mexican drug kingpins are OFF LIMITS -- non-PC!! -- to the Hollywood crowd. So the makers of Unknown pin the blame on some corporation that wants to kill the saintly, selfless scientist who is going to save the world for free.  B. S. !  It made all the good plot elements sour for me.  It's a conspiracy theory that rings false, just like the paranoid theory that ""we would have had electric cars decades ago but the evil oil companies stopped them.""  Doesn't wash with me.

As soon as the movie started I was glued to the screen until the credits came up, that's how good the movie was. This film has it all, suspense, mystery, drama, and a little thrill all in one. I thought the entire cast worked well together; and Frank Langella was classic as an antagnoistic character. I wasn't expecting the twist near the end, which made the movie much more exciting. Who would have thought the true identity of Neeson would be that of a terrorist, I'm just glad he was able to change at the end.

Upon returning to rejoin his wife, she claims she doesn't know him and her husband is Aiden Quinn.From this point, Neeson is whirled into a vertox of proving just who he is.  He convinces Kruger and a retired German soldier (Bruno Ganz) to help him determine what's going on.Although it's fairly obvious what's occurring, the script throws in enough twists to make the whole journey a wild ride.The director maintains both a kinetic energy replete with a great car chase and dramatic breaks giving us more insight into the characters.  There's a brief but chilling scene between Ganz and Frank Langella that's superb in its simplicity.I loved the relationship between Neeson and Kruger.

Diane Kruger (of ""Inglourious Basterds"" fame) is ethereally beautiful as the cab driver who helps Neeson recover his identity.Without getting into plot details, ""Unknown"" resembles a mashup of ""The Bourne Identity,"" Polanski's ""Frantic,"" ""Total Recall"" and the short-lived TV series ""Nowhere Man.""

The same might be said for Aidan Quinn and Frank Langella in their roles, though they do it with more authority than Jones.

I really wasn't sure what to expect, but I was hoping for something along the lines ofTaken. While this movie wasn't much like that one, it was on par with that movie in terms of quality and intrigue. This movie isn't an all-out action movie, but there are a few action-packed scenes when it makes sense to have them. What I liked best about the movie was that it wasn't predictable. The story moves along at a good pace, and as Liam's character tries to unravel the mystery of who he really is, you are right there with him, picking up the clues and revelations at the same time. The older I get, the less I like predictable movies, and this one WASN'T PREDICTABLE. It was just a good movie mystery, and favorable to watch with teenagers. A bit of swearing, a few non-graphic shower scenes, and a few explosions and gun-shots are what earns it the PG-13 rating.

They grab a cab and while loading their luggage into the cab forget a briefcase behind in the luggage carrier.  On the way to their hotel, the cab driver starts to talk on the radio in another language and Dr. Harris asks his wife, ""Did you understand any of this?""  She probably didn't but strangely enough I did understand every word of it.  You would think that people would speak German in Germany, but the cab driver was speaking Turkish.  In another part of the movie, a restaurant owner was also speaking Turkish.Side Note: there is a large population of Turks living in Germany and unfortunately they are not well integrated or assimilated.  This causes friction between the Germans and the Turks.****SPOILER ALERT BELOW*******The movie itself was exciting with unexpected turns of events.  After an accident causes Dr. Harris to lose part of his memory (along the lines of Bourne Identity movies), Dr. Harris discovers that his wife doesn't know him and another man has taken his identity.  But, this movie was not as good as the Bourne Identity series.  One part that did not jive was that earlier in the movie when he was Martin Harris, he was getting his *ss kicked.  But later on when he figured out his real identity, he started to fight back.  This is one big difference between this movie and the Bourne movies.

Liam Neeson plays Martin Harris, a scientist who is attending a biotech conference in Berlin with his wife. Or is he? After an accident, he is left with no identification and no proof of who he is, and everyone is claiming they don't know him. He then proceeds to find out who he is. This type of mystery/thriller has been done before, although perhaps not as slickly as this one. The movie ERASED, starring Aaron Eckhart comes to mind, although that pales in comparison to this in terms of just about everything. Liam Neeson once again shows that he makes a capable, if unexpected, action star and he also has the acting chops to give it some weight. January Jones as his wife, however, is practically a non-entity. She practically sleepwalks through her limited role and doesn't really give off anything resembling human emotion, although that might have been on purpose. To accurately describe my reasoning would delve into spoiler territory, so I'll just leave it at that. Diane Kruger also gave a good performance as an immigrant taxi driver who helps out Liam Neeson's character. Aside from him, she's given the most screen time and is given a nice back story, to boot. Rounding out the cast are Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella. Although neither one of them had a lot of screen time (one might say they were underutilized), they did own the few scenes they were in. In terms of technical quality, the film was decent. There was a fair amount of handheld camerawork, but none of it was too &#34;shaky&#34; and the fight scenes were comprehensible. There was even a couple good car chases. There was also some nice on-location shooting in Berlin, although the visual palette of the film didn't really bring out anything spectacular. Narrative-wise, the film is preposterous but still fun. There was a couple of moments where I laughed out loud due to how ridiculous things were, but overall I just accepted that the whole premise was far-fetched and went with it. Now, being mostly a dumb action movie, you wouldn't expect it to have much in the way of pertinent themes or sociopolitical commentary, but they did manage to shoehorn some in via Bruno Ganz's character, a former Stasi agen,t and a Saudi prince who is bankrolling a GMO project. Nothing too deep is said, but it was nice that they acknowledged that these things exist. As a whole, the movie is ok. It moves along at a good pace and is never boring.

In ""Unknown,"" Neeson plays a mild-mannered doctor and devoted husband who faces a shocking identity crisis while visiting Berlin.  Many viewers have drawn parallels between this film and 2008's Neeson action film ""Taken;"" thankfully, this film seems quite different, and much better.Though both ""Taken"" and ""Unknown"" are action/suspense films, Neeson's character in the latter film spends most of the story as a highly-vulnerable ""everyman.""  His plight - thrown into a strange, cold city in which no one recognizes him - could be taken from a thousand dreams (or at least a hundred Phillip K. Dick short stories).  The premise is so commonplace that the plot could have been derivative and tedious, but it holds and maintains tension quite well.  It also taps into common wish-fulfillment; we all would like to be more than meets the eye.  As one character says: ""It's all about the details.""  And so it is; those details give this film flavor and heft.The supporting cast lend the film much of its interest.  Frank Langella and Bruno Ganz are superb here.  Berlin itself has a great supporting role; it's chilling in its distinctive ""Berlin Blue"" which many directors and cinematographers have labored to perfect.""Unknown"" has its flaws; I automatically deduct a star from almost any film with a car chase.  If it's not ""The French Connection"" or ""Bullitt,"" it's filler.  The chase is blessedly brief.

There is no easy way to sum up the filmUNKNOWN, since it is a thriller, as well as an action piece. I suspect that the book, in English translation, which UNKNOWN is adapted from, as many more answers, and probablyjust as many dead ends. Just as the film THE NINTH GATE was a superbly teased out thread from the book le club Dumas, where certain characters become clear only after readingthe book. Playing with the theme of the loss of memory is an intriguing element, especially when I had received an amazingly erudite book called COMMUNITY in the same weekthat I received UNKNOWN, and I could not help but draw some comparisons. When I had looked up the quote from Jim Morrison, I also found another Morrison quote that could quiteeasily apply to the film unknown:"" I believe in a long, prolonged, derangement of the senses in order to obtain the unknown."" Basically at least the first third of the filmcould apply to this quote. I must admit that my interest in this film was from a promo where there was no indication of the central film story. The film TAKEN is, in my view,what some may term a rock 'em sock 'em roller coaster ride, where the identities of each character are clearly defined, and you are essentially strapped in for an amazingroller coaster ride that few films can emulate in the exact same way. UNKNOWN requires more thought, more intellect, in the approach that the audience should take with such apotentially involving film. I suspect that this film may not be everyone's cup of tea, as some might say, since key characters evolve, develop, and, at least from my point ofview, raise many questions about the nature of who we are, what are our memories, and so on.

The movie does regain some momentum but I can't help feeling cheated by a movie that could have gone to greatness but instantly took a turn to the outhouse.The cast is very good, though Aiden Quinn and January Jones are rather nodescript. There parts are integral, but small enough that Jones' plasticity and Quinn's lack of lines aren't a huge issue. Neeson is his usual good self, Diane Kruger is good as well and some of the supporting characters shine in limited exposure to add a lot of depth early in the movie. The doctor and nurse at the hospital (Karl Markovics and Eva Lobau) add a nice feeling of grounding and Bruno Ganz does also.Still, I was very much enjoying the movie until the reveal.

It's a great setup. Neeson is knocked unconcious in the opening minutes, is in a coma for a few days, and when he finally wakes up, he finds someone else has taken over his life. No one believes Neeson's story -- probably because his wife doesn't back him up. This leaves the rest of the movie for Liam to run around Berlin, trying to prove his case and uncovering a vast Eco-terror plot in the process.Liam simply owns these movies, and it's too his credit that he's reinvented himself as a thinking man's action star. There's also great supporting work from Diane Kruger as the cab driver who helps him (she doesn't get nearly enough work in Hollywood). If only the script had been a little better. Too many times they get help out of nowhere, from a kind-hearted nurse who just happens to know a former East German spy with nothing better to do but take on seemingly insane American hospital patients. It also helps that Diane's cab driver character is on good terms with a nightclub bouncer, giving them a great hideout when they're on the run from mysterious agents.As the twists and turns mount, you think you're headed to a great pay-off, but the final twist seems too fabricated and unlikely, based on a serious of miraculous incidents (not least of which is why Liam cracked his head in the first place).

AND, when he does finally remember who he is, he tries to do the right thing, presumably because he's appalled at the damage he has already caused (several corpses) and because he has had the good fortune to meet an honest illegal alien taxi driver (female, pretty) who has shown herself willing to help him at a time when he didn't know who he was.

1392797,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B004A8ZX28,Steven Aldersley,"[5, 7]","Unknown (drama, mystery, thriller)Directed by Jaume Collet-SerraStarring Liam Neeson, Diane Kruger and January JonesWarner Bros. | 2011 | 113 min | Rated PG-13 | Released Jun 21, 2011Video:Video codec: MPEG-4 AVCVideo resolution: 1080pAspect ratio: 2.40:1Audio:English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1French: Dolby Digital 5.1Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1Portuguese: Dolby Digital 5.1Subtitles:English SDH, French, Spanish, PortugueseDiscs:50GB Blu-ray DiscDVD copy (with digital copy)The Film 4/5Unknown's plot is extremely simple once you know a key piece of information, but that's not revealed until late in the movie. As a result, you'll find yourself confused and having to guess what's really going on. On first viewing, Unknown is full of mystery and puts the viewer in the position of the main protagonist, Martin Harris (Neeson). Like Memento, the story keeps letting us see events in a new context and their meaning changes as a result.Harris flies into Berlin with wife Liz (Jones) for a biotechnology conference. He's one of the speakers. While getting into a taxi at the airport, he leaves behind a briefcase containing his passport and vital documents. Does that seem like the act of a man with the supposed intelligence of Harris? He notices that it's missing when they arrive at the hotel and jumps into another taxi while his wife checks in. There's no signal for his phone (really) so he can't explain his actions.The taxi is involved in an accident and plunges into a river. The driver, Gina (Kruger), pulls him out and then runs off leaving him in the hands of the medics. He wakes up in hospital and all he can remember is his name and that he's married to Liz, who doesn't know where he is. The doctor tells him that he's been in a coma for four days.Luckily, he sees a story about the conference on TV in his room and remembers that he's supposed to be attending. It shows the hotel where he was supposed to check in. How convenient. After checking out and going to the hotel, he sees his wife at a reception. The problem is she says that she doesn't know him. She even introduces another man as her husband, Martin Harris. The hotel security men throw him out. Are you confused yet? Is he really Martin Harris? Is everything we are seeing just some coma-induced dream? Is he crazy?The story continues with Harris trying to prove his identity. He finds Gina and she agrees to help him. He also phones a friend in the US who he knows can confirm his identity. His memories slowly start to return and he notes everything he can remember. One piece of information tells him that he has a meeting arranged with Professor Bressler, who he communicated with by phone and email for a while. Maybe Bressler can confirm his identity? It wouldn't explain his wife's actions, but it would be a start.I won't reveal any more of the story because it would ruin the mystery, but it contains a few glaring plot holes. The exposition is also laughable at times and assumes that the audience is pretty dumb. My favorite example is: ""So that's got all your secrets in it, right?""You might be wondering why I gave the movie such a high score if it's full of so many plot holes and stupid dialogue. The reason is it somehow works. Neeson is such a good actor that he pulls it off. I found myself actually caring about his predicament and wanting to see him resolve it. Most of the supporting cast does a great job too and I was especially impressed with Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella.Did you see the movie posters advertising the theatrical run? It showed Neeson holding a gun and looking ready to take on the world. In short, it was marketed as Taken 2. If you buy the movie on the strength of that image, you may be disappointed. Neeson doesn't touch a gun at any point in the movie. There are a couple of car chases and scenes full of action, but this is nothing like Taken. Neeson does get into a couple of fights, but this is more a mystery than an action movie. Fans of Taken might like Neeson enough to enjoy this too, but be aware that the two movies are very different.I found myself invested in the story, even though I could see that parts of it were contrived or even ludicrous. Neeson plays it dead straight and is believable in his role. Kruger did a good job as his sidekick. I've watched the movie twice now and will be happy to watch it again despite its flaws.Video Quality 4.5/5I have no complaints about the picture quality. Fine grain is present throughout and detail is always strong. I detected one slightly noisy image in a dark scene, but that's a minor quibble. Colors look accurate and the presentation is clean and bright. You'll be very happy when you see it.Audio Quality 5/5The movie starts quietly, but gradually increases in volume as the action rises. Dialogue is always clear, but the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track really starts to shine when we see the car crash. The action scenes in the final act all benefit from heavy use of the surrounds and you'll feel like you're in the middle of the action. The audio presentation is flawless.Special Features 1/5There are two HD features which run for a total of nine minutes and the content of each overlaps with the other. I hoped for much more.Liam Neeson: Known Action Hero (4:33) - Brief interviews with the cast and crew about the making of the film.Unknown: What is Unknown (4:24) - Similar in content to the opening feature, but it's more of an extended advertisement and appears to have been shot before the movie was released.I'm not sure what Unknown is supposed to be. There are too many holes for it to be a serious drama or compelling mystery, but there's not really enough action for it to fall into that genre. If you go into it with the right attitude, you'll probably enjoy it. I had fun watching it the first time and enjoyed seeing it on Blu-ray. For fans of Neeson, it's worth adding to your collection. For action fans, it could fail to meet expectations. The Blu-ray presentation certainly won't disappoint, but there's very little in the way of special features.Overall score 4/5",4,"Don't expect Taken 2, but see it anyway",1308182400,"06 16,

1392799,A17639YIJLDS1G,B004A8ZX28,still searching,"[0, 0]","Fresh from his exploits in Taken it was obviously a good idea to exploit Neeson&#8217;s newly minted tough guy persona while still fresh in the mind of the film-going public: hence Unknown, a shamelessly derivative product if ever there was one!  Perhaps I'm being a little too harsh, but I think not. Naturally, it's impossible to escape our cultural influences and we cannot look at anything without looking through the filters of our experience and here we have a perfect example.  Whether consciously or otherwise the visual echoes of previous productions flicker and sometimes beam from the screen almost blindingly throughout.But this isn&#8217;t meant to be a criticism: for the movie buff it&#8217;s all part of the entertainment!  We have bio-scientist, Dr Martin Harris (Neeson), arriving in a snowy, wintery Berlin accompanied by his wife (January Jones).  Almost three decades before, in Hitchcock&#8217;s Torn Curtain, we had physicist, Dr Michael Armstrong (Paul Newman), arriving in Copenhagen accompanied by his fianc&eacute;e (Julie Andrews).  Both esteemed American scientists are visiting European capitals to give presentations at an important scientific conference.On arriving at their hotel Harris realizes that his briefcase, containing important items like a passport and his presentation papers, has been left at the airport and, bizarrely, without telling his wife he hops back into the taxi and returns to the hotel hoping to retrieve the lost briefcase.  However, calamity strikes and the taxi is involved in an incident that causes it to swerve and hurtle through a barrier into the icy river.  Harris is knocked unconscious but the female driver, who we later come to know as Gina (Diane Kruger) is able to escape and make the surface.  She realizes Harris is still in the car and manages to dive down and save him!He wakes up in hospital and is told he&#8217;s been &#8216;out&#8217; for four days.  Immediately discharging himself he manages to make his way back to his hotel to find his wife who steadfastly refuses to recognize him having in the meantime mysteriously acquired another husband, Dr Martin Harris (Aidan Quinn), who has all the necessary documentation to prove that he is the real Harris and Neeson the imposter!So which one is the real Harris? Since Neeson is the star, it must be him, surely!  But just like Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) before him in North by North West, he has a tough job persuading just about anybody!  However, he&#8217;s given the name of a private detective, a former Stasi operative named Ernst Jurgen (Bruno Ganz) who acts as the &#8216;wiser older mentor&#8217; type figure a la, Dr Brulov (Michael Chekov) in Hitchcock&#8217;s Spellbound.  Jurgen advises &#8216;Harris&#8217; to find the taxi driver, Gina, as he thinks she may be the key!And, indeed, this turns out to be a valid assertion.  Gina, just like Michelle (Emanuelle Seigner) in Polanski&#8217;s Frantic, who aids Harrison Ford&#8217;s Dr Richard Walker (a &#8216;mere&#8217; medical practitioner) in an &#8216;unknown&#8217; Paris, proves to be just the kind of streetwise, knowledgeable young sidekick &#8216;Harris&#8217; needs.So, we&#8217;ve seen many of the elements before but the primary source seems to be Hitchcock, primarily, North by North West: even an evil though amiable and courteous &#8216;Mr Big&#8217; a la James Mason&#8217;s, Phillip Vandamm, in the form of Frank Langella, enters the action about half way through and January Jones and Diana Kruger are a kind of amalgam of Eva Marie Saint&#8217;s, Eve Kendall.Fittingly, then, after suitably Machiavellian plot machinations, the film ends on a train.

1392807,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B004A8ZX28,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[5, 9]","If you are fortunate enough to find yourself in a hit film, Hollywood will most likely ask you to repeat the success and either make a sequel or make a film so similar it could be a sequel. The enticement? Usually a large, mega-size paycheck.A few years ago, Liam Neeson stumbled into a new genre of film with ""Taken"", a silly action film conceived and produced by Luc Besson, the French Joel Silver. It was a big hit and proved the addition of the venerable actor's gravitas to a dumb action film could help the movie stand out from the pack. Hollywood was eager to replicate the success, so Joel Silver brought ""Unknown"" to the popular star.""Taken"" and ""Unknown"" have their respective producer's stamp all over them; Besson films are marked by outlandish, unbelievable story turns and Silver's films usually contain elaborately choreographed improbable action sequences. Yet, because both films star Neeson, and both are set in European cities, I think people assume both films are more similar than they actually are.I was surprised by how much I enjoyed ""Taken"". In it, Neeson's character uses his dormant skill set, abandoned when he changed jobs to save his marriage, to travel to Paris and track down his kidnapped daughter. Unlike Besson's next film ""From Paris With Love"", ""Taken"" works because, and only because of, Neeson's performance. He is so serious throughout you begin to believe he could actually track down his daughter and fight his way though the multitude of bad guys surrounding her.In ""Unknown"", Neeson's character, Dr. Martin Harris, and his quest, have a lot more turns and facets, making the journey more cerebral, more suspenseful and more interesting.That said, my partner guessed the storyline after watching the preview a few months before we actually got to see the film. But I found myself becoming engrossed in the story just the same,Dr, Martin Harris (Neeson) and his wife, Liz (January Jones, TV's ""Mad Men"") arrive in Berlin for a summit. Henry has been invited to speak at a summit sponsored by a leading scientist (Sebastian Koch) ready to reveal a major breakthrough. A controversial Arab leader also sponsors the summit. Because of all of this, security is tight. Upon their arrival, Martin realizes he left his briefcase at the airport and hails a taxi to go back and get it. Liz stays to check in. On the way to the airport, the taxi gets in an accident and plunges into the river. Gina (Diane Kruger), the driver, saves Martin but quickly runs off. Four days later, Martin wakes up in the hospital. He rushes back to the hotel and finds Liz, but she doesn't recognize him. In fact, she introduces Martin, and hotel security, to her husband, Martin (Aidan Quinn). Martin becomes frantic and confused. Then people start trying to kill him.Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (""Orphan"", ""House of Wax (2005)""), ""Unknown"" would be referred to by many as 'Hitchcockian'. Many thrillers are still labeled with this term, trying to draw a connection to the renowned filmmaker. ""Unknown"" is one of the few films deserving the connection; it is evocative of late Hitchcock, lesser Hitchcock, ""Torn Curtain"" Hitchcock, but Collet-Serra gets enough right to earn this comparison.Once again, Neeson's gravitas makes the film watchable and more interesting than it may have a right to be.From the moment the film begins and we meet the couple in the airplane upon their arrival in Berlin, Martin is a serious man; he Is seriously in love with his wife, seriously interested in delivering a good speech at the conference, seriously interested in his colleague's research, seriously confused and becomes seriously pissed off at the people trying to kill him. As soon as he wakes up in the hospital, he tries to piece together what happened. He's been in a coma for four days? His wife has been alone in a city she doesn't know for four days? Then he realizes his wife has been alone for four days while he was in a coma. He rushes to the hotel and spots her.Neeson plays the role straight. In every moment, he has a goal. The goal changes throughout the film, but we always know what he is trying to figure out. The key to his performance is when Martin spots Liz in the hotel. She stares at him blankly, seems a bit confused, and introduces him to her husband. Martin is thoroughly defeated. Maybe he did get things mixed up. Maybe he does have a concussion and the accident was more harmful than he felt. So he returns to the hospital. As he waits for the doctor to run additional tests, someone tries to kill him. He gets pissed off and realizes someone; somewhere is trying to hide something.January Jones is cool and icy and evocative of Tippi Hedren. Liz is enough of an enigma to remain mysterious. Jones walks a tightrope throughout. She has to convince us everything she knows is true, basically contradicting everything we learn. She doesn't seem to fit into the puzzle, but because she is so sure Martin is not her husband, she causes him to feel doubt.The last piece of the puzzle is Diane Kruger's Gina. As she drives the cab Martin is in when he has the accident, is she a piece of the puzzle as well? How does she fit into the puzzle? Gina, an illegal living in Berlin, trying to desperately raise money to get her papers and get out of the city. She takes shifts driving her friend's cab and works other jobs. She seems real and authentic throughout. And in this type of film, this usually means she is involved in some way.Bruno Ganz has a memorable role as Ernst Jurgen, a former Stazi agent who now fills his time as a private eye. He calls on his considerable connections to help him figure things out and tries to help his new client, Martin. There are other facets to his character that make him even more interesting and unusual.Martin is given Jurgen's contact information and arranges to meet with him. Jurgen seems perplexed by the changes going on in the society around him but faces the daily challenges with a certain amount of detachment. After listening to Martin's story, he agrees to poke around a bit. This character is a nice touch because he adds validity to Martin's quest.Frank Langella pops up as one of Martin's colleagues, a man who may be able to help piece the puzzle together.""Unknown"" has a lot of twists and turns. Generally, these can be problematic. The filmmakers are usually not skilled enough to tie everything together, to make everything fit in a believable way an d most viewers are savvy enough to spot these problems right away. But Collet-Serra makes them work. Less skilled directors learn about Hitchcock's use of the 'MacGuffin' and think it gives them license to do whatever they want. But Hitchcock understood he was making a deal with the audience. If the hero is looking for a wine bottle filled with uranium ore or a small statue filled with microfilm, this item needs to remain ever present in the film. This item drives the characters to do what they are doing. The MacGuffin is essential. We don't need to know what it is, but we need to know it is important.In ""Unknown"", the MacGuffin is basically a scientific discovery to be revealed at the conference. Throughout the film, as Martin tries to figure out what is going on, the conference looms in the background. Martin and Liz are traveling to attend the conference. An Arab leader is hosting the conference, leading to heightened security. Professor Bressler, the key speaker, is rumored to have a big announcement scheduled for the conference. As soon as Martin wakes up, he tries to figure out what is going on and everything keeps pointing back to the conference.""Unknown"" is produced by Joel Silver, so improbable; over the top action scenes are part of the mix. Surprisingly, these are fairly well integrated and don't detract from the overall experience.Neeson's newest is a surprise, the pacing is taught, the mystery involving, the suspense is good and the acting is believable.

It had the potential to be so much more, but about three-quarters of the way in it tosses that potential aside and deflates into Hollywood cliche. A large part of the blame for this must be laid at the feet of Collet-Serra (who aside from directing music videos and TV commercials, was responsible for the hideous remake of House Of Wax and the cliche-ridden Orphan) and the hack writers Oliver Butcher (Dr. Jekyll and Ms. Hyde) and Stephen Cornwell (Marshal Law, Killing Streets), whose only real claim to fame is that he's the son of John LeCarre.Dr. Martin Harris (Neeson), a prominent botanist, arrives in Berlin with his beautiful wife (January Jones) to attend a conference. When they reach the hotel, Harris realizes he left his briefcase back at the airport and goes back to get it, hailing a cab driven by Gina (Diane Kruger), a Bosnian immigrant working in Germany illegally. An accident on the way back to the airport sends the taxi off a bridge and into a river, causing Harris to strike his head and go unconscious.  He wakes up in a hospital four days later with hazy memories and no identification, his passport and other documents apparently in the missing briefcase. The hospital, not knowing who he was, had not been able to notify anyone. Harris, worried about his wife, hurries to a reception at the conference, only to find that his wife does not recognize him and that there is another man with her (Aidan Quinn) claiming to be her husband... Dr. Martin Harris. And to his confusion and consternation, his wife is acting as if the other Harris is her husband while professing to never have seen Neeson's Harris before in her life. Furthermore, Quinn's Harris has identification as well as photos of him with his wife, and an internet check turns up Quinn's photo as Dr. Harris and not Neeson's.From that point, Harris must try to prove who he is, to himself as much as to everyone else, and to find out why his wife is refusing to acknowledge his identity. He goes back to where his problems all began - with the cab ride back to the airport - and manages to track down Gina and convinces her to help him. Then strange things start happening. People are trying to kill him and anyone he comes into contact with. He finds messages in code that make no sense but seem to have something to do with a conspiracy. And he keeps getting flashes of memory that seem real and yet are confusing and dream-like. Just who is Martin Harris? And is he the real Harris?The cast is generally capable.  Neeson turns in his usual first-class performance while most of the other actors are workmanlike, if not exactly riveting, in theirs. Bruno Ganz however outshines everyone else in the film in a minor role as a thoroughly unapologetic and unrepentant former Stasi (East German secret police) officer Neeson seeks out to help prove who he is. Ganz (Wings of Desire, Downfall) is truly a marvel to watch, showing how a great actor can turn what might have been a trivial role into one that steals every scene he's in. Frank Langella, a very gifted actor when given the chance (Frost & Nixon, Good Night And Good Luck), is unfortunately wasted in this film. He's played so many villainous and/or creepy characters in recent years that he's become type-cast and his mere presence is a dead giveaway that his character is not on the side of the angels.All in all, Unknown is a watchable if not particularly memorable thriller, so long as you are willing to suspend the average level of disbelief and don't mind its failure to rise above the level of usual Hollywood fare.(*** Warning - From this point on, spoilers await ***)A number of problems keep Unknown from living up to its potential, a big one being its sheer predictability: I had already guessed what the mystery of the two Harrises was just from seeing the trailer.  It really was fairly obvious that there was no real Martin Harris and that Neeson had only been pretending to be Harris when the accident threw a monkey wrench into everything.The other problems with the film generally fall into three categories: (1) characters behaving either stupidly or inconsistently because the plot requires it, (2) plot-holes and character actions requiring repeated suspension of disbelief, and (3) taking the easy, cliched way out to resolve things rather than going in a direction that the audience might not have expected.In no particular order, Unknown is burdened with:Characters with inexplicable driving skills.  One has to wonder about taxi drivers - not to mention botanists - who  somehow pull off stunts and maneuvers that would (and probably did) stagger entire teams of experienced stunt-men.Head trauma as a force for good.  It's been done so many times that it's almost a film cliche that a villain, having taken a good knock in the head that leaves him unable to  remember who or what he really is, somehow undergoes a personality transformation that stays in place even when he finally remembers. And so Neeson's professional assassin who had no problems whatsoever killing people in the past and was on a mission to kill new targets, is now nobly scrambling to save them.  The film would have been far more interesting if Neeson's personality had reverted to sociopathic killer when his memories returned. But then that wouldn't have given the cliched Hollywood ending the script was calling for.Pointless code to be solved. The whole sub-plot around the code, written by Jones, that Neeson finds in a book he's carrying is ridiculous as the only thing they're concealing is the Latin names of two flowers.  First of all, who couldn't simply remember the Latin names of two flowers? Secondly, given that Jones is using them to hack into a laptop from another laptop, why wouldn't she simply keep them on her own laptop?  And why did she bother writing them in a book Neeson was carrying?  Particularly given that when she needed them to hack into the target laptop, she didn't use the book at all.Convenient loss of specific items. A large part of the plot depends on Neeson losing his identification in the accident. But it also depends on him not losing the book and on having some cash.  So voila!  While being fished out of the river, he somehow loses all identification but still has plenty of cash and the book with the code written in it.  Why?  Because the plot requires it.Gina. So, we have a female cab driver (already a low-level probability) with fashion-model good looks (an even lower probability) who speaks perfect English (try finding one of those here!) and who continues to hang around Neeson even after it's clear that he's being pursued by professional assassins who are killing anyone Neeson comes into contact with.People being stupid and/or incompetent because the plot demands it.  Once their targets are no longer in the hotel room, Jones' assassin goes back to disarm the bomb.  For what earthly reason?  Because the plot demands it. And despite knowing everything about where the bomb is, how it's armed, and exactly when it's supposed to go off, she fumbles around ineptly for five minutes trying to disarm the bomb until it finally goes off, killing her and only her.When the shaved-head assassin goes to Neeson's hospital room to finish him off, he kills two nurses in short order, snapping their necks. But for Neeson, instead of simply snapping his neck like the others, the killer decides to tie him to a gurney and then inject some kind of drug into his IV bag which will take minutes to make it down the tube into his system.  Why?  To make it seem like an accident? When he's already leaving two bodies very obviously murdered? Because the plot demands it, that's why.And why do the other assassins keep trying to kill Neeson in such a way that it will look like a drug accident/overdose?  They've been leaving bodies littered left and right with broken necks all over Berlin but for some reason Neeson must look like a drug death? Why? Because the plot requires Neeson must always have enough time to avoid being killed.  Stupid.And on top of it all, the whole elaborate conspiracy to kill a scientist by making it seem as if he was simply a bystander killed in a bombing attack on a rich Arab prince?  Why?  Again, because the plot demands it.All in all, Unknown was an okay thriller, but only just barely.  In the end it was both frustrating and disappointing.  Frustrating because it had the potential to be so much more; disappointing because it settled for the safe, lame and thoroughly cliched Hollywood outcome that we've seen a thousand times before.",3,An

After the rousing success of ""Taken"", Liam Neeson returns to the same basic format in ""Unknown"".  Unfortunately, the final product is far less thrilling and downright bad.For a basic plot summary, ""Unknown"" sees bio-scientist Martin Harris (Neeson) in Germany for a worldwide science convention.  While oversees, Harris is involved in a traffic accident and gets banged around a bit.  When he comes to, his memory is a bit scrambled and his entire identity is seemingly stolen.To put it bluntly, this film is bad in pretty much every aspect, but three really stand out:First off, Hollywood suckers us in by capitalizing on Neeson's ""Taken"" persona, only this time throwing in January Jones (of Mad Men fame) as eye candy.  No new character ground is trod whatsoever.Second, the plot is almost a carbon-copy of the Jason Bourne series, only much less intriguing and reeking again of capitalizing on an already-done idea.Finally, and this is the truly sad part, this movie actually has a decent mystery revealed towards the end.  However, the rest of the movie is so drab that you won't care about the ""big reveal"" when it does arrive.Basically, here is how I look at ""Unknown"": It tries to channel ""Taken"", instead rips off ""Bourne"", and ends up far too close to the dismal ""Edge of Darkness"".
