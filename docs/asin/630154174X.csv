I didn not really find anything wrong with this movie at all. The acting was very good for a B film and it probably would have been better if they upped the gore a little. The main problem was the kills in this movie were the worst in the history of horror films. Ive seen tons and tons of horror movies and I cant recall the kills being as bad as this film.

Truth be told, Cutting Class is not that bad at all. It's just quirky and campy, and I like it that way. The chemistry Brad has with Jill Schoelen is topnotch. Poor Jill, she had to dump Brad as her boyfriend the harshest way possible, and she will have to live with the fact for the rest of her life that Brad Pitt is one of the several most recognizable names on the planet. Sometimes, Donovan Leitch gets in the way but serves his purpose. However, Brad can be really too cocky to be likeable. It depends on the viewer's judgment. Now, only if Roddy McDowell can bring his gun from Class of 1984, he might have be well-prepared for this mini-Scream thriller. Well, I wouldn't say Cutting Class is all horror because I think it's a funny picture. There are scenes, most especially the one with the janitor, that are too funny to watch. The whole Martin ""Help! Help! I am stuck in the wood for a week with an arrow stuck in me!"" Mull is to be seen to believe. Quite so, the suspension of disbelief has to be in a full force, and that's where I actually enjoy the film. There is a guessing game going on who might be the killer. Once I knew who it might be, I second guessed myself too many times. Then to the end, it's been obvious all along. I think that was funny as well. When people are killed or missing, the cops are usually alerted. But in Cutting Class, it seems to be treated phlegmatically. Also, one scene where the counselor is making photocopies, it's usually done with the cover and not in the dark. In there, it's been the opposite. Remember, I said that Cutting Class is quirky and campy, *winks winks*. All in all, Cutting Class is supposed to be about the kids playing hokey only that they never do.",4,Very Funny and Enjoyable Slasher Flick.,1347408000,"09 12, 2012",2012,1866,"['Viewed', '9/12Rate', '89/12', 'become', 'big', 'actors', 'usually', 'get', 'start', 'horror', 'film', 'Cutting', 'Class', 'film', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'Cutting', 'Class', 'not', 'bad', 'just', 'quirky', 'campy', 'like', 'way', 'chemistry', 'Brad', 'Jill', 'Schoelen', 'topnotch', 'Poor', 'Jill', 'had', 'dump', 'Brad', 'boyfriend', 'harshest', 'way', 'possible', 'will', 'have', 'live', 'fact', 'rest', 'life', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'one', 'several', 'most', 'recognizable', 'names', 'planet', 'Sometimes', 'Donovan', 'Leitch', 'way', 'purpose', 'However', 'Brad', 'can', 'be', 'really', 'too', 'cocky', 'be', 'likeable', 'viewer', 'judgment', 'Now', 'only', 'Roddy', 'McDowell', 'can', 'bring', 'gun', 'Class', '1984', 'might', 'have', 'be', 'well-prepared', 'mini-Scream', 'thriller', 'Well', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'Cutting', 'Class', 'horror', 'think', 'funny', 'picture', 'are', 'scenes', 'most', 'especially', 'one', 'janitor', 'are', 'too', 'funny', 'watch', 'whole', 'Martin', 'Help', 'Help', 'am', 'stuck', 'wood', 'week', 'arrow', 'stuck', 'Mull', 'be', 'seen', 'believe', 'Quite', 'so', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'be', 'full', 'force', 'where', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'film', 'guessing', 'game', 'going', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'killer', 'Once', 'knew', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'second', 'guessed', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'Then', 'end', 'been', 'obvious', 'think', 'was', 'funny', 'as', 'well', 'When', 'people', 'are', 'killed', 'missing', 'cops', 'are', 'usually', 'alerted', 'Cutting', 'Class', 'be', 'treated', 'phlegmatically', 'Also', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'counselor', 'making', 'photocopies', 'usually', 'done', 'cover', 'not', 'dark', 'there', 'been', 'opposite', 'Remember', 'said', 'Cutting', 'Class', 'quirky', 'campy', '*winks', 'winks*', 'Cutting', 'Class', 'supposed', 'be', 'kids', 'playing', 'hokey', 'only', 'never', 'do']",N/A

Now we add to the mix several suspects. The boyfriend (Brad Pitt) that seems a tad dysfunctional. Their old friend (Donovan Leitch) fresh from the psycho ward.

254948,A33FCLUEQSUD68,630154174X,Claire,"[0, 0]","If you are one of those people like I am who enjoys cheesy slasher flicks then you'll like this maybe a little. It's got all the components of a B flick horror movie- typical bad acting, multiple dufus types who only serve as red herrings to throw you off the scent of the killer's identity which we spend the majority of the movie trying to figure out, and of course boobs. There must be a rule that in every slasher flick there has to be some pointless scene where some chick is naked. I read some reviewer wrote that Brad Pitt had tried to buy every copy of this movie so it wouldn't be out there. If that's true, then I can't blame old Brad. It's a wonder he ever went on to become so huge a celebrity. His acting is horrendous and he isn't even very good looking YET. I guess like wine, he's aged with time- in a good way. I disagree with another reviewer who said Brad didn't have a very big part. The three main actors seem to all have equal time and balance each other out. Jill Scholen's acting is pretty bad- she's the one who should have been buying up all the copies. Donovan Leitch is the saving grace of the film in regards to acting. I can't figure out why he didn't go on to do more films. He was and still is adorable plus a good actor. As for the dvd, it's a little over-priced but I had wanted to see it so bought it. The biggest problem was that most people want to be guessing who the killer is but on the back of the dvd, they put the killer's picture on there with an axe so it kind of spoiled it for me. Therefore, if you wanna be surprised, try not to look at the back when you open the dvd. Another note not really related to the review, but is there also a rule that every big star has to do a cheesy horror flick before they can get their SAG card? ha ha (i.e. Matthew McConaughey, Johnny Depp, Brad Pitt, Demi Moore, Corey Feldman, Renee Zellweger, Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Bacon and of course, Jamie Lee Curtis etc etc.)",3,Mad for Brad...& Donovan,1263945600,"01 20, 2010",2010,1949,"['are', 'one', 'people', 'am', 'who', 'cheesy', 'slasher', 'flicks', 'then', ""'ll"", 'like', 'maybe', 'little', 'got', 'components', 'B', 'flick', 'horror', 'movie-', 'typical', 'bad', 'acting', 'multiple', 'dufus', 'types', 'who', 'only', 'serve', 'red', 'herrings', 'throw', 'off', 'scent', 'killer', 'identity', 'spend', 'majority', 'movie', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'course', 'boobs', 'must', 'be', 'rule', 'slasher', 'flick', 'there', 'be', 'pointless', 'scene', 'where', 'chick', 'naked', 'read', 'reviewer', 'wrote', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'had', 'tried', 'buy', 'copy', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'out', 'there', 'true', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'old', 'Brad', 'wonder', 'ever', 'went', 'become', 'so', 'huge', 'celebrity', 'acting', 'horrendous', ""n't"", 'even', 'very', 'good', 'looking', 'YET', 'guess', 'wine', 'aged', 'time-', 'good', 'way', 'disagree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', 'Brad', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'big', 'part', 'three', 'main', 'actors', 'seem', 'have', 'equal', 'time', 'balance', 'other', 'out', 'Jill', 'Scholen', 'acting', 'pretty', 'bad-', 'one', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'buying', 'up', 'copies', 'Donovan', 'Leitch', 'saving', 'grace', 'film', 'regards', 'acting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'do', 'more', 'films', 'was', 'still', 'adorable', 'good', 'actor', 'dvd', 'little', 'over-priced', 'had', 'wanted', 'see', 'so', 'bought', 'biggest', 'problem', 'was', 'most', 'people', 'want', 'be', 'guessing', 'who', 'killer', 'back', 'dvd', 'put', 'killer', 'picture', 'axe', 'kind', 'spoiled', 'Therefore', 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'surprised', 'try', 'not', 'look', 'back', 'when', 'open', 'dvd', 'note', 'not', 'really', 'related', 'review', 'there', 'also', 'rule', 'big', 'star', 'do', 'cheesy', 'horror', 'flick', 'can', 'get', 'SAG', 'card', 'ha', 'ha', 'i.e', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'course', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'etc', 'etc']",N/A

Sure, she's responsible enough to be trusted by herself for an entire week...at least, to a point. But hey, I can understand the peer pressure being a little more influential when Brad Pitt is your boyfriend. The timing is impeccable, though, for a institutionalized young man to be released after five years for killing his father. Returning to school after such a stint is enough of a transition to deal with. Now imagine daily electric shock therapy during said stint on top of that. Still, there should be no jumping to conclusions when the high school's faculty and student body starts, well..., losing bodies. You can't rule out perv principal Roddy McDowall, for example. And everybody knows the high school custodian is as much of a suspect as, say, the butler in the old mansion when it comes to whodunits. Only there's not as much mystery as there could have been. Or horror. Or comedy, for that matter. Maybe that's the reason this ""cult classic"" falls into so many subgenres; nobody can determine exactly where it should go due to its content. The interest in seeing an early major role for Pitt will likely provide the majority of the contributing towards any longevity this quasi-slasher film has.

And people may pop this into the dvd player or vcr just to see the movie that was Brad - I'm too gorgeous for words - Pitt's debut.His acting..well it was obvious this was the first major role for him but he wasnt too bad. I am still surprised he improved to the point he is now. Martin Mull (Roseanne) plays the father and local DA. Roddy McDowell is the horny principle who likes looking up the skirts of cheerleaders a bit too much.Paula's father leaves for a hunting trip and she stays by herself for the week. He leaves with the warning of ""no cutting class"" and promptly gets ambushed when he arrives at his destination.Brian Woods is a mental patient who has been released and is now back in school. He used to be friends with Pitts character Dwight but now Dwight avoids him like the bubonic plague. Brian desires a friend in Paula, Dwights girlfriend, so the jealousy and testosterone begins to rise. We have other teen cannon fodder and a few senseless characters thrown into the horror gumbo. Soon dead bodies pop up, and the fingers point in all directions.Is it the ex-nut Brian? Is it the angry Dwight constantly under pressure? The creepy janitor with more than one nut loose whose always threatening? Or someone else entirely?The movie attempts a little Agatha Christie and shows the kills from POV shots. When you think it's obvious, think again. Or maybe not. You will change your mind at least twice, and go back and forth. You may figure out the killer before he or she is shown...but maybe you won't. Either way this movie isn't meant to be COMPLEX as a mystery so figuring it out or not figuring it doesn't take away any enjoyment it offers.The climax is pretty predictable when it comes up but it's still pretty pleasing. Some of the deaths were pretty cool although they weren't violent. The body count is not very high on the charts but it's there.

254964,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,630154174X,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[1, 2]","Yeah, I've always liked this film since I first saw it on HBO many moons ago.  It was at the tail end of the slasher craze, and like many of the slashers of that time, it's partially a comedy.  Not a spoof of the genre, but it has a playful and tongue in cheek approach, though at times it tries(not terribly successfully) to be suspenseful.The body count at high school begins after the return of a former local boy who had been residing in a mental hospital for murdering his father.  He's played by Donovan Leitch, and naturally all eyes are on him as he's branded the creepy and odd one.  He spends a great deal of time lurking about and spying on lovers, Brad Pitt and Jill Schoelen.  He's got the hots for Schoelen and he also wishes to rekindle his friendship with Pitt.  Pitt is the handsome, basketball star badboy boyfriend, and Schoelen is the naive chick who cares more about studying than giving up the goods to Brad.  Schoelen is so naive and clueless, she is completely oblivious to the very obvious advances on her from the lecherous principal played by Roddy McDowall.The body count rises and the accusations fly, and in the end it's either Leitch or Pitt who's guilty of the killings considering they both have their own grudges and share a deadly secret from their youth.  Schoelen is caught in the middle, not sure who to trust.We all know where Brad Pitt's career ended up, so it is fun watching him as the central character of a low budget slasher film.  To me he's always seemed like an arrogant prettyboy, and even here it's no exception.  Though he gets the most screen time, he's billed third in the credits.  Obviously this film was not centering itself on Pitt for starmaking.  We can see here that the attempt was to launch the career of Donovan Leitch instead.  Leitch never did go on to superstardom.  He is the son of Mr. Mellow Yellow himself, Donovan!  This may be why he was looked at as more of a star at the time.  But ya know, Leitch is pretty good here.  Not Oscar material, but his character is given much more depth and more to do than Pitt, who is more or less a cliche.  Leitch is good at the whole is-he-a-killer-or-is-he-not thing.  Plus he pulls off the creepy stalker/odd guy thing really well(he wears a suit, bowling shoes and rides a bicycle).  Near the end of the film he's given some very silly dialogue that would have sounded bad even if Vincent Price had to say it.  So yes, Leitch steals the show here.Schoelen is a kind of second string scream queen.  Remember Popcorn(""Buy a bag, Go home in a box"")?  Or The Phantom of the Opera with Robert Englund?  How about The Stepfather?  There's Jill Schoelen for ya.  Not bad, she's cute, but not terribly memorable either.Roddy McDowall is one of my favorite actors of all time, and I'm kinda mixed on how I feel about his role here.  Playing a pervert principal is beneath him, but at the sane time, we get to see a goofy side of him we really haven't seen before.  Plus, he seems to simply disappear from the film at a certain point, which kinda sucks.There's a bizarre subplot here involving Martin Mull(playing Jill Schoelen's father), as we periodically see him staggering around a marsh after having been shot by an arrow earlier in the film.  These scenes seem kind of like an afterthought or something.  Each time we see Mull, the scene is played as slapstick comedy as he tries to get help or call attention to himself.  To me it seems as though the director got lucky to have Mull show up to do the film, but had nothing for him to do.Lionsgate advertises this DVD as the Unrated version, though I'll be damned if there's anything different in this version from the VHS tape I used to have that said it was rated R.  It wasn't gory to begin with, and still isn't.  Nothing in the way of bonus features.  I suppose it would be too much to ask Brad Pitt to provide a commentary track as I'm sure he probably looks upon this film with contempt now that he's such an important and serious actor and above this sort of thing.But considering the price, the lack of bonus materials isn't so bad.

O'Blenis,"[7, 9]","Gigantically entertaining, scrumptiously sexy slasher/who-done-it combo, set in a high school where the student population is beginning to be killed off.  ""Cutting Class"" is obviously not re-inventing the wheel plotwise, but it does what it does with extreme flair and effectiveness, being one of the few from the vast batch of relatively unknown, sequel-less, usually direct-to-video horror slashers released regularly in the 80s/early 90s (and, welcomely, to an increasing extent today) that can actually hold its own with the best of the famous fare, like ""The Return Of Michael Myers"", ""Jason Goes To Hell"" and ""Wrong Turn"".  Unpredictable, with the rare distinction of having some genuine wit and humor instead of just wince-inducing would-be jokes like many of its peers.  The acting is several cuts above the norm for similar unheralded high-school horror types, starring Jill Schoelen (from the 1989 ""Phantom Of The Opera"" and ""When A Stranger Calls Back"", among others), Brad Pitt, Brenda Klemme (who also shone in ""The Channeller"", another of horror's unheralded greats), Donovan Leitch, Roddy McDowell (from the original ""Planet Of the Apes"" series) and Marin Mull.  Some unexpectedly tense moments, but also manages to be huge fun without ever straying into the dreaded realm of corniness.And did I mention how sexy this is?  From Jil's quick wardrobe change to Brenda's pantyless cheerleading performance, this is red-hot.  Does it with class too - hot and delightful but never crude or vulgar.Right now, it looks like videocassette is the only place this can be tracked down.  If any DVD licencers are seing this (like maybe Anchor Bay, who's earned a great reputation by releasing obscure/unavailable titles on the DVD format), please do us all a favor and at least consider putting this out, preferably with the original late 80s version cover, in a done-right, high-quality audiovisual version (not just transferred directly off a faded fiftenn year-old tape like a few movies seem to have been on some of the smaller distributors.
