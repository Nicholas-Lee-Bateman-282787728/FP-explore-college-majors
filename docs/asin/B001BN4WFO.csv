1172528,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,B001BN4WFO,Amanda Richards,"[23, 23]","It's time for new adventures with our favorite singing and dancing critters, The Backyardigans.  This DVD contains four more episodes from Season Three, and these are:1. Escape from Fairytale Village: Tyrone plays a paperboy with a new route.  The thing is, his new clients include Austin the Wolf, Uniqua the Witch and Pablo the Giant, and they all want to have him for dinner.  If your kids know their nursery rhymes they'll love this one, and you'll like the bluegrass music.2. Front Page News: Tasha plays a photographer with a secret super identity, and when a giant robot attacks Bigopolis she's sent out by Editor Pablo to get the scoop.  The thing is, how to get the picture when you're busy saving the city? Tyrone as Captain Bubble and Uniqua as Bug Girl provide superhero support to a background of Berlin cabaret music.  Best song: ""Cheese Cheese""3. Le Master of Disguise: Pablo is Le Master of Disguise and is hiding on The Orient Express. Police Inspector Austin has to find him before the train reaches Istanbul.  Also starring Conductor Uniqua, Cowboy Tyrone and Tasha the Circus Performer.  There's only one sure way to identify Le Master of Disguise, and Austin knows what it is. This one is set to Nigerian pop music.4. Pirate Camp: Uniqua and Pablo sign up for pirate training aboard Pirate Austin's ship, Camp Walkaplanka.  Lessons include the Heave Ho, the Swashbuckle and the Scalawag.  Trouble strikes when Pirate Austin is captured by the ghost of Captain Redboots (Tasha).  Can the trainee pirates save the day? Arrrrrh!  The usual four songs are set to the garage band genre.Another fun and imaginative addition to the series, and a great gift idea for your favorite small fry.  Arrrrrh!Amanda Richards, October 15, 2008",5,Still going......,1224028800,"10 15, 2008",2008,1747,"['time', 'new', 'adventures', 'favorite', 'singing', 'dancing', 'critters', 'Backyardigans', 'DVD', 'four', 'more', 'episodes', 'Season', 'Three', 'are:1', 'Escape', 'Fairytale', 'Village', 'Tyrone', 'paperboy', 'new', 'route', 'thing', 'new', 'clients', 'include', 'Austin', 'Wolf', 'Uniqua', 'Witch', 'Pablo', 'Giant', 'want', 'have', 'dinner', 'kids', 'know', 'nursery', 'rhymes', ""'ll"", 'love', 'one', ""'ll"", 'like', 'bluegrass', 'music.2', 'Front', 'Page', 'News', 'Tasha', 'photographer', 'secret', 'super', 'identity', 'when', 'giant', 'robot', 'attacks', 'Bigopolis', 'sent', 'out', 'Editor', 'Pablo', 'get', 'scoop', 'thing', 'how', 'get', 'picture', 'when', ""'re"", 'busy', 'saving', 'city', 'Tyrone', 'Captain', 'Bubble', 'Uniqua', 'Bug', 'Girl', 'provide', 'superhero', 'support', 'background', 'Berlin', 'cabaret', 'music', 'Best', 'song', 'Cheese', 'Cheese', '3', 'Le', 'Master', 'Disguise', 'Pablo', 'Le', 'Master', 'Disguise', 'hiding', 'Orient', 'Express', 'Police', 'Inspector', 'Austin', 'find', 'train', 'Istanbul', 'Also', 'starring', 'Conductor', 'Uniqua', 'Cowboy', 'Tyrone', 'Tasha', 'Circus', 'Performer', 'only', 'one', 'sure', 'way', 'identify', 'Le', 'Master', 'Disguise', 'Austin', 'what', 'one', 'set', 'Nigerian', 'pop', 'music.4', 'Pirate', 'Camp', 'Uniqua', 'Pablo', 'sign', 'up', 'pirate', 'training', 'Pirate', 'Austin', 'ship', 'Camp', 'Walkaplanka', 'Lessons', 'include', 'Heave', 'Ho', 'Swashbuckle', 'Scalawag', 'Trouble', 'strikes', 'when', 'Pirate', 'Austin', 'captured', 'ghost', 'Captain', 'Redboots', 'Tasha', 'Can', 'trainee', 'pirates', 'save', 'day', 'Arrrrrh', 'usual', 'four', 'songs', 'are', 'set', 'garage', 'band', 'genre.Another', 'fun', 'imaginative', 'addition', 'series', 'great', 'gift', 'idea', 'favorite', 'small', 'fry', 'Arrrrrh', 'Amanda', 'Richards', 'October', '15', '2008']",The Backyardigans: Escape from Fairytale Village
