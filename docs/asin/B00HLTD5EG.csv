Sure the topic is very scary and in reality it's crazy to make jokes out of such stuff. It happens, it's real and it's the most dangerous thing that can happen to a person, in my humble opinion. But none the less I came for a comedy and it delivered. Was funnier than the first one and I liked it. Stupid? Yes, but it was funny. I really would like even more from the third movie.",4,Hope the third movie will be even better than this one,1405641600,"07 18, 2014",2014,409,"['actually', 'kind', 'liked', 'Sure', 'topic', 'very', 'scary', 'reality', 'crazy', 'make', 'jokes', 'such', 'stuff', 'real', 'most', 'dangerous', 'thing', 'can', 'happen', 'person', 'humble', 'opinion', 'none', 'less', 'came', 'comedy', 'delivered', 'Was', 'funnier', 'first', 'one', 'liked', 'Stupid', 'Yes', 'was', 'funny', 'really', 'would', 'like', 'even', 'more', 'third', 'movie']",A Haunted House 2

Yes, Scary Movie and even part 2 where classic comedies and some of the best parody films ever made, but he had the rest of his brothers with the exception of Damon and a whole crew of writers making that film. There was something like 12 writers making Scary Movie, and after that the Scary Movie franchise reigns where handed to 1 of the 3 legendary parody writers of movies like Airplane, The Naked Gun and Hot Shots (David Zucker)... while 2 of the 12 writers went off and have just about ruined parody movies since with all the &#34;(enter name here) Movie&#34; concoctions, and then Marlon decides to go solo and work on something like A Haunted House and this sequel, which screams out the question, WHY? For one, Marlon already did a haunted house movie with Scary Movie 2... then he goes and does A Haunted House which came out roughly the exact same time as Scary MoVie, and they where simmilar in what they where parodying.... why the heck did Marlon not just do the smart thing and team up with David Zucker and make another Scary Movie that would have combined the best of what Scary MoVie and Haunted House had, which wasn't much, but at least combining them would have possibly gotten at least a half decent movie out.After seeing this one, it's clear Marlon can't do it on his own. I didn't not laugh out loud once during this whole thing, and probably because the strongest gags have been done already in previous Scary Movie movies. How many times can a penis show up on screen and be funny? It was done in Scary Movie 1, how many times is smashing an animal around gonna be funny? Again, done in both the other movies... and not to mention the fast forward Benny Hill style sex scenes... it's just been done to death already, and it's not funny seeing it repeated again and again.Just quit Marlon, don't even try to make another parody unless you bring back your brothers, or even try hooking up with the Zuckers and Jim Abraham... on your own, you just ain't delivering the goods. This movie was a waste of time to make, and watch.",1,"""Miss me?"" - Nope, not at all.",1405296000,"07 14, 2014",2014,2173,"['Marlon', 'Wayans', 'really', 'give', 'up', 'trying', 'make', 'parody', 'movies', 'work', 'rest', 'family', 'board', 'Yes', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'even', 'part', '2', 'where', 'classic', 'comedies', 'best', 'parody', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'had', 'rest', 'brothers', 'exception', 'Damon', 'whole', 'crew', 'writers', 'making', 'film', 'was', 'something', '12', 'writers', 'making', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'franchise', 'reigns', 'where', 'handed', '1', '3', 'legendary', 'parody', 'writers', 'movies', 'Airplane', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'Hot', 'Shots', 'David', 'Zucker', '2', '12', 'writers', 'went', 'off', 'have', 'just', 'about', 'ruined', 'parody', 'movies', '34', 'enter', 'name', 'here', 'Movie', '34', 'concoctions', 'then', 'Marlon', 'go', 'solo', 'work', 'something', 'A', 'Haunted', 'House', 'sequel', 'out', 'question', 'WHY', 'one', 'Marlon', 'already', 'did', 'haunted', 'house', 'movie', 'Scary', 'Movie', '2', 'then', 'A', 'Haunted', 'House', 'came', 'out', 'roughly', 'exact', 'same', 'time', 'Scary', 'MoVie', 'where', 'simmilar', 'what', 'where', 'parodying', 'why', 'heck', 'did', 'Marlon', 'not', 'just', 'do', 'smart', 'thing', 'team', 'up', 'David', 'Zucker', 'make', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'would', 'have', 'combined', 'best', 'what', 'Scary', 'MoVie', 'Haunted', 'House', 'had', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'least', 'combining', 'would', 'have', 'possibly', 'gotten', 'least', 'half', 'decent', 'movie', 'out.After', 'seeing', 'one', 'clear', 'Marlon', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'own', 'did', ""n't"", 'not', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'once', 'whole', 'thing', 'probably', 'strongest', 'gags', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'already', 'previous', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'movies', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'penis', 'show', 'up', 'screen', 'be', 'funny', 'was', 'done', 'Scary', 'Movie', '1', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'smashing', 'animal', 'gon', 'be', 'funny', 'Again', 'done', 'other', 'movies', 'not', 'mention', 'fast', 'forward', 'Benny', 'Hill', 'style', 'sex', 'scenes', 'just', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'already', 'not', 'funny', 'seeing', 'repeated', 'again', 'again.Just', 'quit', 'Marlon', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'make', 'parody', 'bring', 'back', 'brothers', 'even', 'try', 'hooking', 'up', 'Zuckers', 'Jim', 'Abraham', 'own', 'just', 'ai', ""n't"", 'delivering', 'goods', 'movie', 'was', 'waste', 'time', 'make', 'watch']",A Haunted House 2

I'm sending you back to Taiwan!&#34; After finally getting rid of his possessed ex, Malcolm (Wayans) has started a new life in a new house with his new girl Megan (Pressly). When the same thing starts happening again he thinks it has to do with a creepy doll. Once again Malcolm has to exercise something out of his life. So I will say that I thought the first one was funny for about 20 minutes then started to get old. Most spoof movies are like that though so I won't hold it against them. I in no way thought this needed a sequel. After about five minutes I was certain that they didn't need a sequel. While the first one kept me laughing for about half the time I don't think I even smiled at all watching this one. It may be that the humor just wasn't for me but some of the jokes went on way to long and they weren't funny to start with (the sex scene with the doll for example). It had the right idea mixing Sinister and The Conjuring for the main story line but they didn't do anything with it. Overall, a movie that started off annoying and never really got better, I really struggled to get through this one.
