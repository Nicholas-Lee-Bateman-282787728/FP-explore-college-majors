Usually good camera angles, poignant music and misty-eyed expressions of love and humanity in the face of annihilation make it happen (think of the closing scenes from Paths of Glory).  We have a movie of stark, dark humored gloom, of engaging Canadians (aren't they always) allowing some humanity, love and glibness to crush the normal anarchy and depraved chaos the end of the world may cause.  Sandra Oh's car isn't just vandalized, it leans on its hind quarters against the store.  The vandals put some thought into it.Throughout the film you realize it's not puzzling at all as to why we go on living until we can't, why there is such a fine line from wanting to live and wanting to die that most of us won't cross with a train about to squash us.  And for the final scene to unfold with Pete Seeger's version of doomed Cuban revolutionary Jose Marti's ""Guantanamera"" providing the perfect soundtrack of love and humanity in the scope of doom, coupling with the final couple's decision to let love conquer all, it left this viewer unable to speak or interact with others for days, simply because where I come from the singleminded status infected hordes refuse to get it. After all, we watch brainless hollywood stenographed screenplays regurgitated in our faces.  This scene has never left my head for the last 8 years and probably never will, even if the DVD is released with no extras and no letterboxes.  It's still rewarding to let these characters reveal their truths and be ""the poor people of this earth who want to share their fates"".

68427,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,0783240228,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 4]","I'm usually a fan of the odd and quirky, but this definitively odd and quirky little apocalyptic film never really connected with me in a spiritual or emotional way.  I'm used to liking films others don't like, so it's always a little disconcerting to find myself explaining my dissatisfaction with a movie that others found moving or even profound.  Certainly, the potential end of humanity should be a profound concept.  All I found among the characters of Last Night, however, was an aloof sense of resignation - and very little despair.  Tragic figures abound, but any overall sense of tragedy somehow comes up lacking, as far as I'm concerned.Last Night begins at 6:00 pm on humanity's last day of existence.  Six hours later, at precisely midnight, the world is going to end - and everyone knows it.  Apparently, it's been common knowledge for at least a couple of months, so by this point most people seemed pretty much resigned to the fact that they are in their final hours of life and have already decided how they will spend their last night.  Some choose to act like hooligans out on the streets, some unite with their families, some (even at least one hooker) continue working, some prepare to meet their end in solitude, etc.  Patrick Wheeler (Don McKellar, who also wrote and directed the film) leaves his family gathering to meet death on his own terms, only to find himself interacting with others in an effort to help reunite Sandra (Sandra Oh) and her husband Duncan (played by David Cronenberg), a gas company executive who goes to the trouble of making courtesy calls to every single customer of the company before the end comes.  Sandra apparently spent so much time preparing for her final moments that she forgot to purchase necessary supplies until the very last day, at which point she is unable to make it back home.  While the film centers on Patrick and Sandra, other characters certainly leave an impression upon the viewer.  Patrick's friend Alex (Trent McMullen), for example, has devoted all of his final days to fulfilling every sexual fantasy he can think of.  Another acquaintance schedules his musical debut for the final hour.  Then there are basically throwaway characters who lend an even more surreal feel to what is happening, such as a mother and daughter who sit along on a vacant bus throughout the duration of the story.All of this is interesting, but I didn't find any of it particularly moving.  What we are privy to here are people leading futile lives preparing for their own futile ends.  I should be feeling mournful and compassionate towards these people - but I really don't, and that is why Last Night failed to win me over.  There just doesn't seem to be any point to all of this.  The only thing that kept me hooked was my curiosity concerning how the world would end.  That is not something that our characters speak of, although one gets a sense of its potential nature from the complete lack of darkness accompanying the day's late night hours.  It turns out that this world goes out with a proverbial whimper, and I think the same can be said of this film.",3,Possesses more of a sense of futility than tragedy,1328313600,"02 4, 2012",2012,3117,"[""'m"", 'usually', 'fan', 'odd', 'quirky', 'definitively', 'odd', 'quirky', 'little', 'apocalyptic', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'connected', 'spiritual', 'emotional', 'way', ""'m"", 'used', 'liking', 'films', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'always', 'little', 'disconcerting', 'find', 'explaining', 'dissatisfaction', 'movie', 'others', 'found', 'moving', 'even', 'profound', 'Certainly', 'potential', 'end', 'humanity', 'should', 'be', 'profound', 'concept', 'found', 'characters', 'Last', 'Night', 'however', 'was', 'aloof', 'sense', 'resignation', 'very', 'little', 'despair', 'Tragic', 'figures', 'abound', 'overall', 'sense', 'tragedy', 'somehow', 'up', 'lacking', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned.Last', 'Night', '6:00', 'pm', 'humanity', 'last', 'day', 'existence', 'Six', 'hours', 'later', 'precisely', 'midnight', 'world', 'going', 'end', 'everyone', 'Apparently', 'been', 'common', 'knowledge', 'least', 'couple', 'months', 'so', 'point', 'most', 'people', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'much', 'resigned', 'fact', 'are', 'final', 'hours', 'life', 'have', 'already', 'decided', 'how', 'will', 'spend', 'last', 'night', 'choose', 'act', 'hooligans', 'out', 'streets', 'unite', 'families', 'even', 'least', 'one', 'hooker', 'continue', 'working', 'prepare', 'meet', 'end', 'solitude', 'etc', 'Patrick', 'Wheeler', 'Don', 'McKellar', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'directed', 'film', 'family', 'gathering', 'meet', 'death', 'own', 'terms', 'only', 'find', 'interacting', 'others', 'effort', 'help', 'reunite', 'Sandra', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'husband', 'Duncan', 'played', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'gas', 'company', 'executive', 'who', 'trouble', 'making', 'courtesy', 'calls', 'single', 'customer', 'company', 'end', 'Sandra', 'apparently', 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'preparing', 'final', 'moments', 'forgot', 'purchase', 'necessary', 'supplies', 'very', 'last', 'day', 'point', 'unable', 'make', 'back', 'home', 'film', 'centers', 'Patrick', 'Sandra', 'other', 'characters', 'certainly', 'leave', 'impression', 'viewer', 'Patrick', 'friend', 'Alex', 'Trent', 'McMullen', 'example', 'devoted', 'final', 'days', 'fulfilling', 'sexual', 'fantasy', 'can', 'think', 'acquaintance', 'musical', 'debut', 'final', 'hour', 'Then', 'are', 'basically', 'throwaway', 'characters', 'who', 'lend', 'even', 'more', 'surreal', 'feel', 'what', 'happening', 'such', 'mother', 'daughter', 'who', 'along', 'vacant', 'bus', 'duration', 'story.All', 'interesting', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'particularly', 'moving', 'What', 'are', 'privy', 'here', 'are', 'people', 'leading', 'futile', 'lives', 'preparing', 'own', 'futile', 'should', 'be', 'feeling', 'mournful', 'compassionate', 'towards', 'people', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'why', 'Last', 'Night', 'failed', 'win', 'over', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'point', 'only', 'thing', 'kept', 'hooked', 'was', 'curiosity', 'concerning', 'how', 'world', 'would', 'end', 'not', 'something', 'characters', 'speak', 'one', 'sense', 'potential', 'nature', 'complete', 'lack', 'darkness', 'accompanying', 'day', 'late', 'night', 'hours', 'out', 'world', 'out', 'proverbial', 'whimper', 'think', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'film']",N/A

Director/star Don McKellar takes his cue from the more intelligent, character-driven apocalyptic films like &quot;Day The Earth Caught Fire&quot;, &quot;Miracle Mile&quot; and &quot;Quiet Earth&quot;. The story intimately focuses on several Toronto residents and how they choose to spend (what they know to be) the final 6 hours of thier lives. Some viewers may recognize McKellar from his work with director Atom Egoyan. He must have have been taking notes, because as a director, McKellar has inherited Egoyan's quiet, deliberate way of drawing you straight into the emotional core of his characters. Fantastic ensemble work, featuring a couple of casting coups: the timelessly beautiful and classy Genevieve Bujold and a rare acting appearance by oddball Canadian splatter director David Cronenberg. Although generally somber in tone, the well-written script delivers many laugh-out-loud moments, funny in a very real,gallows-humor way. The powerful and  unforgettable final scene packs an almost indescribably emotional wallop.

68429,A1FQ04UJHTGII1,0783240228,Douglas Setter,"[2, 2]","As a Sci-fi and action fan, I expected Last Night to be full of survivalist fights and savagery.  The movie had a bit of that, but for the most part, it was how different people were facing the last 6 hours on earth.  The movie starts out with Sandra (Sandra Oh), picking up some food and wine at an abandoned store in Toronto.  Her car gets flipped by a mob and she is forced to walk across town to home.  Strangely, there is not quite the havoc one would expect (like the LA riots).  Tired and frustrated, she rests outside of the apartment of Patrick (Don McKellar) a cynical man who just left his family's mock Christmas party.  Patrick lets Sandra use his telephone and eventually agrees to help her get a car so she can die with her husband.  He seeks the aid of two friends for the use of a car.  One is too busy giving his first (and last) piano recital.  The other friend is a make-out man dedicating his last days to every sexual encounter possible.  Patrick visits the make-out man, just in time to meet the make-out man's latest lover: his former high school French teacher.  But, no one judges anyone as it is the final few hours on earth.  The make-out guy is reluctant to give up one of his 3 cars as it is important to his image.  But, he finally finds it in his heart to help out.  The movie goes on like this.  Everyone is facing their final few hours in a pretty civilized for the most part.  I liked some of the dialogue and comments.  Eg. ""Why does everyone feel sorry for children? They haven't done any living, yet.""  The filming was not the greatest, but if you looked at it like a stage play it is quite brilliant and entertaining.  Great sound track with top music from the 60's and 70's. I really liked Sandra Oh's character and in my humble opinion, think that she made the movie.

68432,ACVNA57PI4DLV,0783240228,Francois Tremblay,"[13, 16]","There is no more night, the world is plunged in eternal light. Toronto, 8PM, four hours before the end of the world. The government has closed down two months ago, there is no more police, and the city is under anarchy rule. The masses have claimed the streets : car travel is hazardous at best. Some people work to report or entertain people in the last hours (such as the radio announcer who proudly announces ""here at CKRT... with you... until the end""), but most services are down. This is it. This is THE END. What do you do ?Patrick Wheeler already knows the answer. He is invited to his parents' home, where his mother is preparing a Christmas dinner, even though it is not Christmas. A cynic at heart and seemingly disgusted at the ""fake"" of a family he never liked, he can't help disparaging his mother's efforts to give peace to her family. After he leaves, he is planning to wait until the last minutes, when he will install his radio system outside, play some good music, sit in a chair, and wait for the end. As good a way to go, I suppose.Including Patrick, we follow a group of loosely-knit people as they prepare for the end, including Sandra Oh, whose desperation to get to her husband intertwines her life with Patrick, Craig Zwiller, best friend of Patrick who decides to spend his last days in constant sex, a French teacher (played by Genevi&egrave;ve Bujold), a pianist, and others.In this frenzy of violence in the streets on the one hand, and the desire for a final accomplishment played out by his friends on the other hand, Patrick wants no part of all this and wants to die alone, but events conspire to derail his simple plans. He is interesting to follow, as an egoist character who spurns the superficiality and frenzy of those around him, while deeply aware of the gravity of the situation. Sort of tying the movie together is the president of the gas company (played by known sci-fi director David Cronenberg, an added plus), who has made it his job to call every customer to thank them and wish them good final hours.The masses go crazy in fear and revolt, as masses are wont to do, but that's not what concerns the movie (a Hollywood take on this plot would have concentrated on the violence, or saving the Earth, or otherwise some meaningless romance, and that's why I don't bother to watch Hollywood movies). There is only as much violence as necessary, but this is not a slow movie - in fact, if there is one thing I have against Last Night, it's that it doesn't stop. Moments of contemplation would have helped.As for how to define it, you could say it's a mix of black comedy and drama, although I'm not sure that really captures it. It all looks perfectly ""natural"", if you understand me - the humour and drama seem completely incidental. This is what impressed me most.Like Cube, it got moderate critical approval but few people seem to think it's a masterpiece. I guess my love for science-fiction shines through again. This is the kind of movie I love - hard science-fiction, no special effects, no more violence than necessary, paced like clockwork (in this case, I guess there was not much choice, huh ?), lots of dialogue, as natural as possible, and very moving despite - or rather, because of - the lack of Hollywood-like action and histrionics. If you have the same tastes as I do, it is highly likely that you will love Last Night. The acting is delicious, especially Don McKellar as Patrick (he really enhances the movie as its main actor), and David Cronenberg.In his review, Roger Ebert recounts the following anecdote. On a talk show in Toronto, Wayne Clarkson, the former director of the Toronto Film Festival, explained the difference between Canadian and American movies by using Last Night as example : ""Sandra Oh goes into a grocery story to find a bottle of wine for dinner.

68433,A367Q9VRWQZG7W,0783240228,Gavin B.,"[3, 3]","What would you do if you knew the world was going to end tomorrow? Don McKellar answers this question in his full feature debut, as a director, and dazzles us with his wry humor and big heart.  McKellar, Canada's best kept cinematic secret, and a triple threat player as he writes, directs and plays leading man with equally strong effect.  I would recommend Hollywood to take notice of McKellar and give the guy a budget and let him run with it. Previously best known for his role in as the pet shop owner in the indie film ""Exotica"", McKellar's end of the world opus is made on a shoesting budget with an ensemble cast of excellent B-list actors.McKellar does not waste time with lengthly explanations of why the world is ending at midnight. The only information we get is that it has something to do with the sun, goverment has been shut down for two months and everyone is pretty much attempting to cope with this grim inevitability in their own way.  David Cronenberg (the director) plays a gas company manager who dutifully and hilariously calls through a phone list of customers thanking them for their support over the years and wishing them a happy ending.  A doting mother calls together her family for a final ""Christmas"" dinner and appears to be cooking everything in the freezer. The magnificent Genvieve Bujold plays an aging French teacher who visits many of her former students.  Others want to go out with a big bang.  Indie veteran actor, Keith Rennie Callum, is on the internet attempting to seduce women into performing every conceivable sex act that he hasn't tried. Many of the younger crowd go ""wilding""; getting drunk, intimidating passerbys and counting down the end of the world in a New Years Eve Times Square type of gathering.  Don McKeller's leading man and Sandra Oh's leading lady play the star-crossed pair who by serendipty are in the same place at the same time.  McKellar's visually stunning camera angles in the wordless final scene between Sandra Oh and himself make the final frames of ""Last Night"" among the most powerful in recent memory.McKellar's filmaking and writting technique have Robert Altman as a precendent.  He strings together loose vignettes of seemingly isolated events and unconnected characters and shows us the interconnectivety of all things. McKellar's storyboarding is stronger than director Paul Thomas Anderson (""Magnolia""), the best known of the younger generation of Altman devotees.

68437,A3DE1IYJGU5HPW,0783240228,Jason N. Mical,"[2, 5]","There's no escaping it - when you're making a movie about how people respond to the immenant end of the world, there's only so much ground to cover.  Don McKellar's film Last Night, while delivering where other movies and books have not, rehashes a lot of cliches left over from books and movies like &quot;On the Beach.&quot;One of the things that appeals to me about end-of-the-world and (post) holocaust media is that it depicts ordinary people in extraordinary situations, and speculates on how those people - and ourselves - might react.  Do we dismiss ethics?  Turn to hedonism?  Try to find meaning in the few remaining aspects of our life we can cling to?On the Beach wrestled with these issues before, and Last Night does again.  Don't get me wrong; McKellar allows the viewer plenty of room for interpretation, and has colored his script with a good deal more humor than Shute's downer of a novel.  The thing that keeps Last Night from being a truly great piece of filmmaking, though, is that it ultimately fails to go the extra step into territory unexplored.The direction and acting is top-notch, and the cinematography is very well done.  The final scene of the movie, on the rooftop, is one of the most memorable scenes in any film I've ever watched.I recommend Last Night, but you might want to rent if before you buy it.  I'd also be interested to see if a widescreen version is supposed to come out, because the pan-and-scan left a little to be desired.",4,"Very well done, but not all that original",983750400,"03 5, 2001",2001,1470,"['escaping', 'when', ""'re"", 'making', 'movie', 'how', 'people', 'respond', 'immenant', 'end', 'world', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'ground', 'cover', 'Don', 'McKellar', 'film', 'Last', 'Night', 'delivering', 'where', 'other', 'movies', 'books', 'have', 'not', 'lot', 'cliches', 'left', 'over', 'books', 'movies', 'quot', 'Beach.', 'quot', 'One', 'things', 'appeals', 'end-of-the-world', 'post', 'holocaust', 'media', 'ordinary', 'people', 'extraordinary', 'situations', 'speculates', 'how', 'people', 'might', 'react', 'Do', 'dismiss', 'ethics', 'Turn', 'hedonism', 'Try', 'find', 'meaning', 'few', 'remaining', 'aspects', 'life', 'can', 'cling', 'Beach', 'wrestled', 'issues', 'Last', 'Night', 'again', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'McKellar', 'viewer', 'plenty', 'room', 'interpretation', 'colored', 'script', 'good', 'deal', 'more', 'humor', 'Shute', 'downer', 'novel', 'thing', 'Last', 'Night', 'being', 'truly', 'great', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'ultimately', 'go', 'extra', 'step', 'territory', 'unexplored.The', 'direction', 'acting', 'top-notch', 'cinematography', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'final', 'scene', 'movie', 'rooftop', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched.I', 'recommend', 'Last', 'Night', 'might', 'want', 'rent', 'buy', ""'d"", 'also', 'be', 'interested', 'see', 'widescreen', 'version', 'supposed', 'come', 'out', 'pan-and-scan', 'left', 'little', 'be', 'desired']",N/A
68438,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,0783240228,Jeffrey Leach,"[49, 51]","Most films dealing with apocalyptic themes, especially nowadays, likes to use a ton of flashy special effects and thundering soundtracks to convey the imminent demise of our planet. Fortunately for viewers who want something a little more thought provoking, other films about the end of the world occasionally slip through the cracks. One of these films is ""Last Night,"" a chilling, low budget piece of cinema from Canada. ""Last Night"" doesn't have huge asteroids slamming into the planet, or killer plagues turning the human population into dust, but it does have heavy atmosphere and compelling performances from several actors and actresses you have probably never heard about. The movie even casts famous horror film director David Cronenberg in a major role. If you tire easily of the big Hollywood action/apocalypse films, turn to something like ""Last Night"" to get your Armageddon fix. About the only problem I had with ""Last Night"" concerned the play list on the radio station as it counted down the top 500 songs of all time. Personally, I didn't recognize very many of these tunes; I would have picked a few numbers that are more upbeat myself.""Last Night"" distressingly describes the last six hours of the last night the human race will ever see. Set in Toronto, Canada, the movie closely follows the final hours of several individuals, including a reclusive loner and his family, his best friend, an Asian woman desperately trying to reach her husband before the catastrophe arrives, an energy executive and his secretary, and a former high school French teacher. Perhaps surprisingly, most of these people sedately go about the last moments of their lives as though it isn't a big deal. The reason for this maddening calmness rests with the fact that the entire planet has known for some months that the end is coming, so most of the hysterical behavior you would expect to see has already worked itself out of most people's systems (Not everyone accepts their destiny. The streets are dangerous in places, with gangs going around tipping over buses or shooting and robbing people, but many people are staying at home quietly planning their final activities). What remains is a slightly sad resignation of the inescapable as each individual in the film goes about his or her personal business.Duncan, the energy executive played by Canadian director David Cronenberg, spends his last few hours calling all of his customers to promise them that the power will remain on until the bitter end. Patrick Wheeler, the main character of the film and the loner who wishes to spend his last moments of life alone, makes an appearance at a family Christmas party where some of his pent up bitterness about a life cut short seep out in vitriolic comments to his parents and sister. His friend resorts to playing sexual games, trying to sleep with as many women of different races and physical attributes as possible. One of the women he conquers is his former French teacher, played effectively by a still sexy Genevieve Bujold. Bujold's appearance marks one of the most absurdly comic moments of the film when she quizzes a confused Patrick on his French speaking skills. The best performance in ""Last Night"" comes from the remarkable and beautiful Sandra Oh, who plays the Asian woman looking for her husband. She soon comes into Patrick's orbit, and seeks his help so she can carry out a grisly pact she made with her spouse. Oh, perhaps better than anyone else in the film, truly conveys the utter helplessness of the unfolding situation.There seems to be some difficulty among viewers concerning what exactly will destroy the human race in this movie. I find this a bit odd because the ending gives a clear hint, and if that isn't enough, the fact that the sun still shines at midnight should provide a further clue. But what destroys the earth isn't as important as what the characters do regarding their impending fate, and that fate hangs over every action in the film like a black pall. Occasionally, the time flashes on the screen as the characters move another hour closer to doom, giving the whole film an incredible sense of claustrophobic tension. Arguably, the best line in the film comes from Patrick and his oversexed buddy, when Patrick says ""See you later"" and his friend replies without missing a beat, ""No, you won't."" Moments like these continually pull the viewer back into the unbearable agony of the film's central premise: There is no hope here, no magical hiding place in the mountains or under the sea where someone can avoid their fate. The ending is never in doubt in ""Last Night.""If I had to compare ""Last Night"" with another film or book, I would say that Nevil Shute's ""On the Beach"" closely resembles this film in its psychological exploration of an unavoidable apocalyptic disaster. I noticed I was quiet and reflective for some time after watching this film, always a good indication that a movie or a book touched me in some way. Regrettably, the DVD of ""Last Night"" is a bare bones edition. All you get on the disc is a theatrical trailer and the film. I think a commentary would have been nice, at the very least, but ultimately the movie succeeds without any further elaborations by the director or writers. Hopefully, this great movie will see a reissue on DVD soon.",5,Powerful and Grim,1066435200,"10 18, 2003",2003,5309,"['Most', 'films', 'dealing', 'apocalyptic', 'themes', 'especially', 'nowadays',

This is the story of the last night on earth. For the past few months the people of earth have known that the world would end at this midnight, obviously having something to do with the sun...which even at 11:59:59 shines as brightly as midday.  Around the city of Toronto, a family sits down to Christmas dinner, though it is not Christmas. A man working for the gas company (David Cronenberg) calls everyone in Toronto to let them know that their gas will be on for as long as possible. His wife (Sandra Oh) desperately attempts to get home after her car is vandalized by looters. A man elsewhere in the city attempts every sexual fantasy he has ever considered. When another gentleman (McKellar, who also directed) who has every intention sitting home alone listening to music up until the end runs into Sandra, and they wind up spending their last hours together.There has never to my knowledge ever been a film like this one. No drama, no hysterics, this movie shows the world as it most likely really would end were we to be made aware of it a couple of months in advance. It makes you sit down and think for a moment about who you would like to spend your last hours with. Family, friends, lovers? Who would be important to you during the last six hours, and how would you wish to spend it with them? I couldn't fathom of it, but McKellar, who also wrote this story, does a brilliant job of it. This movie is amazing and beautiful and rarely tragic. It is definitely worth your time and definitely worth the purchase. It's food for thought, and a brilliant accomplishment by McKellar. If you like him, check out some of his other work such as Exotica and eXistenZ.

68440,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,0783240228,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[8, 8]","This small Canadian picture from writer/director/star Don McKellar came as a huge surprise.  As it begins, there are six hours left before the end of the world.  It's never divulged just what has transpired to bring about this catastrophe, but that's completely secondary to the very real and human stories unfolding.  As people confront the end in different ways--some dignified, some anarchic--this picture connects with small moments and believable characterizations.Far from typical Apocalyptic representations, this is a refreshing story about human interactions.  There is some looting and rioting, to be sure, but much of that is a backdrop to normal people facing the inevitable.  They all have different ways they want to face the end--attend a last concert, be alone, have an impromptu Christmas, watch home movies, go to a party, have sex.  Realistic and small observances are what will make this film linger in my mind.McKellar is great as a man who just wants to be left alone, having already lost the woman he loves.  Sandra Oh probably has the showiest role as a woman trying to get across town so that she may fulfill a suicide pact with her husband.  She is understated and powerful.  The rest of the cast is a virtual Who's Who of Canadian cinema including Sarah Polley, Genevieve Bujold, director David Cronenberg, Egoyan regular Arsinee Khanjian, and many other recognizable faces.I really enjoyed this picture.  It never tries to manipulate your feelings, it's all so matter of fact--that is its strongest point!  It would have been easy to manufacture this tale as a weeper.  But that doesn't mean it won't connect with you emotionally, it just isn't obvious about it.  The end was surprisingly touching and moving--all the more so because I didn't know I was so drawn in.  Mind you, however, this isn't slick--it's low budget and small.  Maybe it's not for everyone, but if you enjoy a character driven story--this could be a nice surprise.  It was for me.

Last Night explores the answers.Would you become utterly hedonistic, sampling every perverse pleasure you can imagine like Craig (Callum Keith Rennie)? Would throw one last Christmas party with friends and family even though it's not Christmas like the Wheeler family?  Would you try to comfort others in their last moments like local gas company owner Duncan (David Cronenberg)?  SPOILER NIGHT: Would you party like Jennifer Wheeler (Sarah Polley), plan to end it all before the end comes (Sandra Oh), run through the streets screaming (Jackie Burroughs), or just become utterly paralyzed with fear (Arsinee Khanjian)? Or maybe, like Patrick Wheeler (Don McKellar), you'd just like to be left alone as you brood the loss of your beloved who left the world too early to share the apocalypse with you. Last Night deftly ties all these choices together in a neat tapestry of woe as the nights get brighter and brighter.As Last Night progresses a clock ticks off each hour.  Unlike the post-apocalyptic visions we've become accustomed to, Last Night's horror has long since worn off on its beleaguered citizens. There are still vandals roaming the streets, but the hopelessness of the situation has begun to sink in.  Why steal anything when you won't live long enough to enjoy it?  The people who would do harm act out of sheer nihilistic indifference, struggling to feel alive by destroying.  The crux of Last Night is these little random acts of living.There's no eleventh hour salvation, no secret sanctuary to save the protagonists, no major revelation about the nature of the apocalypse.  The apocalypse is coming, the world is ending, and Last Night asks: What are you going to do about it?The answer: You can live a lifetime in under thirty seconds. You just have to spend it wisely.

68443,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,0783240228,Muzzlehatch,"[2, 2]","I saw this when it originally came out; I think actually it was at a film festival. I was thinking that it was originally commissioned as part of a project called ""2000 Seen By..."" in which a whole bunch of directors around the world made films about the end of the millenium, but I don't see any info on that.  I think it must have premiered in Chicago at the same time as some of that series which I saw, thus the confusion in my mind after 11 years. At any rate, it has a ""millenial"" feel even if the exact date isn't mentioned, and I liked it then and even more on this viewing.It's not just the end of the world as we know it, it's the end of the world period, but we (mostly) still feel fine.  Or at least...resigned and OK about it. Director-writer Don McKellar plays Patrick Wheeler, a successful architect who lives alone in a high-rise in Toronto, and at the beginning of the film he's going to a ""Christmas"" dinner with his family, who he's been somewhat estranged from it seems; after that he plans to return home to await the end, which will occur at midnight.  As I said, the date isn't given, but it might be around Christmas-time, though it's warm and the sun is bright in the sky throughout the night.  Presumably the sun is about to go supernova and burn the planet up - certainly the only logical explanation for a warm, bright and green Toronto in the winter!Patrick soon runs across Sandra (Sandra Oh), trying to get back to her husband to be with him at the end.  Her car has been wrecked by vandals and she lives on the other side of town; public transportation and cabs are nonexistant at this point. Patrick doesn't really want to help her at first, quite selfishly (but understandably if you think about it) wanting his end to be what he had designed - but through events and his own deeper selflessness he becomes involved in trying to help her through most of the rest of the film.  We also drop in on Craig (Callum Keith Rennie) who is trying to satisfy as many sexual fantasies as he can before the end; Duncan (David Cronenberg), a gas company manager who is personally calling all of his customers to with them farewell; a mother and daughter (Arsin&eacute;e Khanjian and Chandra Muszka) sitting desolately on an abandoned streetcar, and a few other disparate characters, most of whom in the end wind up having connections to each other that weren't at first apparent.Canadian cinema fans will no doubt recognize a lot of people involved in the film - with the Cronenberg connection and Khanjian (Atom Egoyan's wife and principle collaborator), Oh and Sarah Polley (as Patrick's sister) among others it has the feeling of a ""Canada's greatest hits"" cast, but I think that's entirely appropriate - the film as a whole takes a very different approach to the looming catastrophe than something like ARMAGEDDON, released the same year. I don't know how conscious McKellar was of this, but the film strikes me in some ways as a rebuke to the notion that we have to approach the end - of life or of the world - with anger, violence, madness - or with the notion that we can save ourselves no matter what the scientists tell us.  Although plenty of fear and negative emotions and violence exist in the film, we're also constantly reminded that many Torontians are approaching the end with grace and dignity, and somehow in this film that actually seems logical and realistic.  I could be reading too much into it I suppose, but through the various coincidences and the spectacularly wonderful - yet wholly predictable, if you really divine what the film is reaching for - ending, we see people searching for, and often finding, hope and forgiveness and love in the face of the end.  Certainly a very different sort of ""armageddon"" than the ones we typically see in the multiplexes.The film wouldn't have worked at all if not for the two leads; at first I wasn't crazy about Patrick, who seems a little too snobbish and bitchy to be quite believable at the end of the world - but eventually both through the revelation of his past and McKellar's general underplaying he becomes more compelling.  Oh is terrific, and for once her long, sad face is utterly appropriate; in the finale she is absolutely radiant when at last she finds the strength to smile and to feel something other than loss, if only for the last second.Although some of the secondary characters seem like they could have/should have been fleshed out a bit more to me (Sarah Polley's in particular) and there's a bit of a rushed quality, overall this is a beautiful and sensitive and warmly humanistic film, a low-key corrective to the notion that we have to approach ""the end"" kicking and screaming, something that's all too rare in the context of it's subject matter - and in general.

Perhaps the sun will go nova. Perhaps a vagrant neutron star has wandered into the solar system and is headed for earth. The sky never turns dark during those six hours, which is as much of a clue as we get. It doesn't matter. What matters is that everyone in the world has known about the end for months, there is nothing anyone can do to prevent it, and this is the last night.The people in the movie act as we all do all the time, only more intensely. In order to cope, some ignore the reality, some seek family, some seek solitude, some turn to religion, some turn to drugs, some engage in pillage and rapine, some lose themselves in work, some party, and some plan suicide. One character tries to fulfill every sexual fantasy before the end. Another runs nonstop around Toronto. One stays at work and makes thank-you calls to customers. Their reactions all make a kind of sense. In truth, we all face last night even if we don't know the precise second of its arrival, and we all behave in one or more of these various ways. Six hours, six years, or six decades are just a blink of an eye in the scheme of things after all.The script is full of low-key dark humor. One cranky woman, for example, when someone says ""it's is hard on the children,"" complains, ""I don't give a damn. People are always saying 'The children. Pity the children'.

His roles in Exotica, a CBC series and other wonderful bits of artistic work have made me a big fan.Last Night is what someone could call an Apocalyptic Comedy.  Ever think you'd see a movie like that?  Is it even possible to make something like that?  Well, it is indeed and McKellar does it with great humour.  The funniest scene is he seeing his family to celebrate Christmas, even though it isn't Christmas - people just want to try and have a final celebration.Then there is the frustration with the brilliant co-star of the film as she desperately wants to get in touch with her husband and she cannot.  At the same time, McKellar weaves a dark yet very funny movie.  How is the world ending?  How do people know this?  You never find out.  They just do, and somehow that is enough.I would not say that this movie was &quot;realistic&quot;; people seemed so accepting that the world was ending.  They just were trying to figure out things to do as they wait.  I found it chilling in that, as I watched it, i was working in a job that was trying to solve the Y2k problem.  I can only look back at THAT and this movie with even greater sardonic humour.With a cameo by Cronnenburg, some great plot twists and stark imagery, this movie is a cinematic work of genius.

In Toronto, families sit down for one final meal together, the radio station counts down the 500 greatest songs of all time while crowds mingle in a city square to count down the seconds. In the streets looters steal for the sheer thrill, and vandals destroy property because no one cares anymore. This dark character drama covers a range of people that are tied together in some way, whether they are fulfilling sexual fantasises or lifelong dreams. Characters are so resigned to death that they are almost non-chalant about it. They accept their fate and do not waste their last hours. This movie's glaring faults could well be it's strengths; the tedious moments involving awkward stares and silences are annoying, but they build tension in ways words would struggle to do. These indie, art-house stylings are not out of place in a McKellar film, who has had a hand in other langorous and underplayed dramas such as Exotica and the Red Violin.

What heartless DJ would play songs to their certainly depressed sad listeners like ""the last song"" and ""I didn't get to sleep at all"". Is that helping anyone?  Seems to me they would play upbeat songs like ""joy to the world"" or Van Morrison's ""Moondance"". The music they played on the radio was the only thing I found NOT believeable in this film.

68452,A3T689SS856U3N,0783240228,Vincent Lassauw,"[1, 1]","Great movie by Don McKellar, who also plays the lead. The movie was part of a 1998 world wide project inviting directors, as the millennium was drawing close, to make a movie related to an ""end of the world"" subject. 1999 a network broadcasted this movie and I caught it halfway through and was on the edge of my seat until it finished, so I didn't stop until it became part of my movie collection which at that time was a bit of a challenge.In view of the subject mentioned above, the title of the movie is an exact representation of what it's about. Say, the last 6 hours of everybody on this planet have started, what would you do with the time remaining? The nice thing about this movie is that it doesn't try to be some Hollywood spectacle, but handles the subject from the individual view point of a group of people spending their last few remaining hours.It's not explained what's causing the end of the world. All the viewer gets to know is that it has been known to the world for a number of months and all you visually notice is that in the evening hours the light outside remains bright as day, a comet perhaps, but it doesn't really matter.The character that connects the people portrayed in the movie is that of Patrick Wheeler (McKellar), who really had decided to spend the remaining hours on his own, but that plan is not really working out. First of all, there are his family duties and even on this very last day he's not spared the painful rituals that these entail, including an impromptu Christmas celebration during which his mother unsuccessfully tries to emotionally blackmail him into staying with them.The next scene gives us a mood picture of Toronto with lots of background noise of people partying and rioting, smoke plumes rising from buildings and finally zooming in on a woman (the marvelous Arsinee Khanjian, known from many wonderful Canadian movies like Exotica and The Adjuster) who is waiting in a bus with her daughter for a driver who will obviously never come and refusing, in spite of her daughter's pleas, to leave, not even when a group of people start their attempts of toppling the bus.Meanwhile in a supermarket a woman (the wonderful Sandra Oh, yet another Canadian film diva) is doing some proletarian shopping for a bottle of wine, surrounded by looting people. She's carrying and anxiously holding on to a small case and as she leaves the store finds her car upright against a street light. She tries her luck with aforementioned bus, but as no coherent response is forthcoming to her queries, she gets out again and resumes her search for transportation.Meanwhile Patrick Wheeler returns home after a narrow escape from his parents' house and on his doorstep finds the transportation denied woman who asks him the use of his phone as she wants to call her husband to inform him of her problems returning home. First Patrick Wheeler is hesitant but finally he gives in to the desperate pleas of the woman. Her subsequent attempts to reach her husband prove in vain and as the time to get to him before the end has passed Patrick offers her to stay with him until the end. She agrees providing he on his part agrees to a request of hers which completely stuns him and will shape his final hours in quite a different way as he might have expected.The relationship that develops between them those few remaining hours are central to the movie, even though there are some sideline stories. At one point, in a final attempt to get the woman home, to go to one of Patrick's friends. This friend turns out to be in the final hours of a 'project' that's been going on for the last few months which entails having all his sexual fantasies fulfilled, including a sexual encounter with his former high school French teacher, played by Genevi&egrave;ve Bujold. We also become witness to Sandra Oh's husband, the one she is so desperately trying to reach, played by nobody less than David Cronenberg, wrapping up final business affairs for the gas company he manages, before going home where the days events catch up with him. His secretary, who has a crush on her boss, in her final hours decides to give in to a long harbored desire.All the goings on are musically framed by a radio broadcast featuring a dj's personal all time favorite top 500, a nice touch.I really don't want to give away anything more, except that this is a great movie that really drew me in and it's astonishing ending, followed by the wonderful end credit music, moved me to tears.
