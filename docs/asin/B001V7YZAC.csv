I realize that the general public would never think of this option, but there are many of us that are hearing impaired and would also love to be able to enjoy many of the wonderful movies that are out there..Most other companies offer subtitles.

1243193,A3VBSPN28EAFSW,B001V7YZAC,Phil J,"[0, 0]","We like to watch dramas/mysteries that rely on writing, acting, directing and scenery.  Any show that uses sex or nudity or special effects is missing one or more of those four requirements.  The Poirot mysteries with David Suchet charge away on all four cylinders.  These are really good family entertainment.  The shows move along at a pace that allows you to exercise your little gray cells.  As I watched Peril at End House, I felt something was missing until, about half way through, Inspector Japp appeared.  He really adds a lot to these shows.  Although, Inspector Japp was not in Dumb Witness, the plot and suspects were entertaining enough to keep me guessing throughout - unfortunately, my own little gray cells were not able to figure out the murderer until Poirot worked through his &#34;gather all the suspects&#34; scene.

I remember she used to tell me how my grandmother was a fun of this novelist, and when she was young she also wonder...specially because my grandfather used to always make negative comments about her choice of literature.  Well, am I impress? YES!  Dame Agatha Christie knew what she was doing. And I'm glad that my mother was enchanted with both Poirot & Marple, the first movie she saw was the black and white ""And then there were none"", she was disappointed with the ending, since it's not how it ends in the novel, but it started her in her way to find more books and movies, I have been very happy to purchase them through Amazon, we just simply can't get enough of Amazon.
