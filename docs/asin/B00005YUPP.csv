Usually I've purchased used BEs becasue they have nice shots of animals, though I am constantly amazed at how they claim to be educational when they are so poorly designed. The design of this DVD reflects exceptionally inadequate understanding of how infants acquire language. Words are introduced by showing parts of objects that would be difficult for a baby to identify (such as bits of an object shown through a camera lens, or showing toys that look minimally like the animal/object), they are presented in such a way that it is sometimes difficult to determine which object in the shot is the one that goes with the word, and most importantly they don't pair the spoken word with the images. How is this supposed to be 'from a baby's perspective' as they tout, when they have clearly little grasp of how to make something accessable to a developing mind? Not to mention that babies and young children don't understand figurative language (like metaphor) so exposing them to adult poetry seems more geared towards parental egos than anything else.",1,Useful only as pretty images,1168905600,"01 16, 2007",2007,1141,"['bought', 'consignment', 'store', '2', 'dollars', 'was', 'more', 'was', 'worth', 'Usually', ""'ve"", 'purchased', 'used', 'BEs', 'becasue', 'have', 'nice', 'shots', 'animals', 'am', 'constantly', 'amazed', 'how', 'claim', 'be', 'educational', 'when', 'are', 'so', 'poorly', 'designed', 'design', 'DVD', 'exceptionally', 'inadequate', 'understanding', 'how', 'infants', 'acquire', 'language', 'Words', 'are', 'introduced', 'showing', 'parts', 'objects', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'baby', 'identify', 'such', 'bits', 'object', 'shown', 'camera', 'showing', 'toys', 'look', 'minimally', 'animal/object', 'are', 'presented', 'such', 'way', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'determine', 'object', 'shot', 'one', 'word', 'most', 'importantly', 'do', ""n't"", 'pair', 'spoken', 'word', 'images', 'How', 'supposed', 'be', 'baby', 'perspective', 'tout', 'when', 'have', 'clearly', 'little', 'grasp', 'how', 'make', 'something', 'accessable', 'developing', 'mind', 'Not', 'mention', 'babies', 'young', 'children', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'figurative', 'language', 'metaphor', 'so', 'exposing', 'adult', 'poetry', 'more', 'geared', 'towards', 'parental', 'egos', 'anything', 'else']",N/A

The word is shown on the screen followed by the object or animal then a short poem. It is very colorful and entertaining to watch and the music follows the actions of the objects perfectly.

I don't like sticking my five month old in front of the tv for long periods of time, but I will let him watch a 20 minute baby Einstein movie while I get ready for the day. He's got Baby Mozart, Beethoven, Baby Neptune: Discovering Water and Baby Van Gogh: Discovering Colors. For Christmas we ordered him Baby Shakespeare's World of Poetry. This one is suggested for 1 year and up, but I popped it in to see what his reaction would be. His eyes were glued to the tv and he immediately began laughing and smiling as words like &#34;train,&#34; &#34;cat&#34; and others flash on the screen, and a poem is read in the background. It seems to be his favorite of the ones he's seen. The writer in me is already proud!

At 4 months I found this DVD and Mozart and read the reviews here where people said their infants were mezmerized.  I bought both.  At the beginning she liked Mozart better.  But by 5 months she preferred Shakespeare because of all the silly puppets and their noises.  She Loves the Train poem, and the tiger in the grass and Bard when he plays in the colorful leaves.

691148,A1GOJL8ZS95UKO,B00005YUPP,Mom Of Many Munchkins,"[4, 12]","Another Baby Einstein video that was such a disappointment.  This video recites poems.  The voice is Julie Clark (if you've read my other reviews you already know I don't care for her voice as the narrator.  No offense Julie!).  They show something, such as an apple, train, cat, grass, leaf, etc. and then recite a poem about it.  A lot of the poems don't make sense and I don't think they are very good for a baby video.  Often the toys they show have nothing to do with the word that the poem is about.  Here's an example of a poem for the word apple:""It's the fall.  The unfallen apples hold their brightness a little longer, into the blue air hold the dream that could be brighter.""What???  I guess I am not much for poems, but to me that is just dumb and doesn't make any sense to me (I'm not even sure where you'd put the punctuation in that poem).

691149,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B00005YUPP,Scott Schiefelbein,"[3, 3]","Our daughter has been watching ""Baby Shakespeare"" since around 8 months.  The language elements (each separate vignette tracks to a word, like ""grass,"" ""snow,"" ""leaf,"" etc.) were a bit beyond her at first --it's not like she was repeating the words or anything -- but the combination of words, music (classical -- mainly Beethoven) and images make her giggle constantly and keep her riveted for about half an hour.Officially, ""Bard the Dragon"" is the hero of the DVD, and our daughter is now sufficiently familiar with Bard so that she laughs at him as he frolics on screen.  Other giggles come from the shots of the live kids singing the ""ABCs,"" and from some of the toys that are shown on-screen during the musical numbers.  Bard has other ""friends"" in the DVD, but they aren't on the screen as much, so our daughter hasn't gotten quite as ""bonded"" with them as she has with Bard.The DVD has a few options, but you will probably find yourself hitting the main ""Theater"" option most.

I actually really enjoyed the video also even though there were some odd parts where certain animals were introduced but no coinciding skit afterwards. I especially found the arranged Beethoven compositions to be really good in this video (considering the Beethoven vid didn't catch mine or my sons attention). We both enjoyed the poetry in this video, and I'm not a real big fan of poetry for various reasons, my only complaint about those sections is that they're really quiet even with the dialogue enhanced on our system. All these parents who seem to believe, however, that the classical poetry/artwork/compositions that go along with these videos are too advanced for their children forget that to maintain a child's interest in learning you have to expose them from an early age to classical medias that challenge them. My child responds greatly to composers like Mozart and Beethoven, artwork by Bottecelli and Van Gogh because he was exposed very early on to classical works and at this point he's only 6 mos 3 wks.
