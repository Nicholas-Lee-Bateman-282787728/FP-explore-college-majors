Goldie Hawn was very convincing as the woman who fell in love with a man whom she really didn't know at all.  The Rich Man's Wife, starring Halle Berry, had a few twists and turns that kept my attention.  But Summer of Sam---I don't know about that one.  If it was about The Son of Sam, the serial killer who terrorized the city of New York, then it missed its point.  The killer was only a subplot in this mishmash of a movie.
