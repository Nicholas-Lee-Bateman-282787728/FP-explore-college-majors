1406643,A1KJ1TRORSE5WG,B004G8QO7U,AlskerSvenskFilm,"[2, 2]","ACADEMY AWARD WINNER BEST FOREIGN FILM 2011, GOLDEN GLOBE WINNER BEST FOREIGN FILM 2011.In a Better World is a wonderful mature drama from Danish Director Susanne Bier. Many film directors have signature elements to their process and although I have only seen two other Bier films (After the Wedding and Things We Lost in the Fire). There are elements of herself, her voice, which she lends to the creative process, cinematography, musical composition, editing and etc. I felt something familiar, something personal that felt familiar, yet I could not place my finger on it. I felt connected to her work like I knew her work so very well, yet is was still very special and new to me. Her hidden, yet visible stamp.The cinematography nourishes us with equally breathtaking sweeping vista's of African plains and Danish coastlines. The feel she created, we can almost touch and smell and taste the lovely Danish countrysides and African skies. The visual content is quite magnificent.The story is so very simple and straightforward. Yet we are held tight to the screen by MASTER ACTORS. Actors who take us with them to the places they are going inside their hearts and souls.Mikael Persbrandt is a soaring Swedish talent with no boundaries on his range. I own several Mikael Persbtandt works including Everlasting Moments, Day and Night, Bang Bang Orangutan, and Search. He reaches for the moon we see at night from Earth and brings us several of Saturn's moons. His performance, it is REAL and ORGANIC. He IS that man in Denmark and Africa, He IS that character.The Dane, Trine Dyrholm gives us her soul as a mother and a wife. She pulls at our heartstrings and brings tears to our eyes. She is a master actor. I am now a huge fan. I will find her past works and view this skilled actor's history. She brought only truths to the screen. Wow. She is a FORCE!Ulrich Thomsen is a distinguished Danish actor who has been booked by Hollywood in films such as The International. He is a powerful screen presence and he had to reign in his screen force to play this simple role. The three leads, they all carry this movie as our consciences, our logical mature internal voices. Ulrich Thomsen in particular speaks without words. He is at that level where we know where he is at through his thought process. He is a pure master actor.The boys are the heart of this piece. Usually kids ruin these kinds of slow powerful dramas, yet these kids are perfect in their roles. Their decisions, their choices, their unheard voices, their thoughts, and their raw fire drives this film. Ultimately they make adult choices, but they do not have the capacity to fully understand their decisions until the choice has been made. When made, they do the right thing, a little late, but they do the right thing. Kids love their parents even when they hate them. The changes internally kids go through are difficult and that makes patience a key to not losing your kids hearts and love.MASTERFUL!I love films with depth, perception, humanity, exploration of our emotional conditions without being dialogue heavy, or too slick or too mainstream. This film is true to its core.After seeing this I felt like I am....In A Better World",5,In A Better World,1302566400,"04 12, 2011",2011,3203,"['ACADEMY', 'AWARD', 'WINNER', 'BEST', 'FOREIGN', 'FILM', '2011', 'GOLDEN', 'GLOBE', 'WINNER', 'BEST', 'FOREIGN', 'FILM', '2011.In', 'Better', 'World', 'wonderful', 'mature', 'drama', 'Danish', 'Director', 'Susanne', 'Bier', 'Many', 'film', 'directors', 'have', 'signature', 'elements', 'process', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'two', 'other', 'Bier', 'films', 'Wedding', 'Things', 'Lost', 'Fire', 'are', 'elements', 'herself', 'voice', 'creative', 'process', 'cinematography', 'musical', 'composition', 'editing', 'etc', 'felt', 'something', 'familiar', 'something', 'personal', 'felt', 'familiar', 'yet', 'could', 'not', 'place', 'finger', 'felt', 'connected', 'work', 'knew', 'work', 'so', 'very', 'well', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'special', 'new', 'hidden', 'yet', 'visible', 'stamp.The', 'cinematography', 'nourishes', 'equally', 'breathtaking', 'sweeping', 'vista', 'African', 'plains', 'Danish', 'coastlines', 'feel', 'created', 'can', 'almost', 'touch', 'smell', 'taste', 'lovely', 'Danish', 'countrysides', 'African', 'skies', 'visual', 'content', 'quite', 'magnificent.The', 'story', 'so', 'very', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'are', 'held', 'tight', 'screen', 'MASTER', 'ACTORS', 'Actors', 'who', 'take', 'places', 'are', 'going', 'hearts', 'souls.Mikael', 'Persbrandt', 'soaring', 'Swedish', 'talent', 'boundaries', 'range', 'own', 'several', 'Mikael', 'Persbtandt', 'including', 'Everlasting', 'Moments', 'Day', 'Night', 'Bang', 'Bang', 'Orangutan', 'Search', 'moon', 'see', 'night', 'Earth', 'several', 'Saturn', 'moons', 'performance', 'REAL', 'ORGANIC', 'man', 'Denmark', 'Africa', 'character.The', 'Dane', 'Trine', 'Dyrholm', 'soul', 'mother', 'wife', 'heartstrings', 'tears', 'eyes', 'master', 'actor', 'am', 'now', 'huge', 'fan', 'will', 'find', 'past', 'works', 'view', 'skilled', 'actor', 'history', 'brought', 'only', 'truths', 'screen', 'Wow', 'FORCE', 'Ulrich', 'Thomsen', 'distinguished', 'Danish', 'actor', 'who', 'been', 'booked', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'such', 'International', 'powerful', 'screen', 'presence', 'had', 'reign', 'screen', 'force', 'play', 'simple', 'role', 'three', 'leads', 'carry', 'movie', 'consciences', 'logical', 'mature', 'internal', 'voices', 'Ulrich', 'Thomsen', 'particular', 'speaks', 'words', 'level', 'where', 'know', 'where', 'thought', 'process', 'pure', 'master', 'actor.The', 'boys', 'are', 'heart', 'piece', 'Usually', 'kids', 'ruin', 'kinds', 'slow', 'powerful', 'dramas', 'yet', 'kids', 'are', 'perfect', 'roles', 'decisions', 'choices', 'unheard', 'voices', 'thoughts', 'raw', 'fire', 'film', 'Ultimately', 'make', 'adult', 'choices', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'capacity', 'fully', 'understand', 'decisions', 'choice', 'been', 'made', 'When', 'made', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'little', 'late', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'Kids', 'love', 'parents', 'even', 'when', 'hate', 'changes', 'internally', 'kids', 'go', 'are', 'difficult', 'patience', 'key', 'not', 'losing', 'kids', 'hearts', 'love.MASTERFUL', 'love', 'films', 'depth', 'perception', 'humanity', 'exploration', 'emotional', 'conditions', 'being', 'dialogue', 'heavy', 'too', 'slick', 'too', 'mainstream', 'film', 'true', 'core.After', 'seeing', 'felt', 'am', 'Better', 'World']",N/A

1406645,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B004G8QO7U,Andrew Ellington,"[9, 10]","There is no denying the message brought out in `In a Better World'.  Susanne Bier (god, I love her) has a way of working with situations and actors to create such visceral chemistry.  I've seen all of her works, and while `In a Better World' is far from her strongest (just watch `After the Wedding' and tell me it isn't one of the single greatest cinematic achievements of the past decade...I dare you) it still carries her trademark aura.`In a Better World' explores a different theme for Bier.  Here she tackles violence, its root and the steady escalation of untreated anger.  It is within this theme, and the overall construction of its elements, that the film falters for me.  While I find it more compelling than the lauded `A History of Violence', it doesn't quite capture the unsettling realities of violence that any one of Michael Haneke's masterpieces has done (especially `Cache').  Instead, `In a Better World' is a little too calculated for its own good.  I actually loved the assessment given by the sites reviewer, Robert Horton.  He states ""this film is rendered with great care and each new strand of the plot is thought out and carefully placed...maybe, if anything, slightly too carefully placed--the story is so neatly plotted and balanced it comes close to being a closed system"", and I concur with this sentiment.  The film is so obvious in its construction that the eventualities bare less impact than they would if there was that element of surprise, and that element is a big one when considering violence as an act.  Violence is often senseless and careless and unwarranted, and while this film touches on those areas (school bullies, ruthless warlords) it doesn't allow that energy to seep into the skin of the picture.`In a Better World' deals with dueling families affected by various degrees and expressions of violence.  Anton is separated from his wife Marianne after his indiscretions catch up with him.  While he is off in Africa taking care of women ravaged by a disgusting warlord, Marianne is taking care of their son Elias who is suffering emotionally by the torment of a school bully.  Claus, recently widowed after his wife lost her battle with cancer, is trying to repair his relationship with his young son Christian, who has witnessed Elias's treatment and has retaliated with a burst of violence that left the tormentor bruised, battered and scared.  Christian begins to fray though, using this situation not as a stepping stone for change but instead, he spirals down into a morbid and vengeful spirit as he contemplates exacting revenge on anyone who treats him or those around him unfairly.  Anton, who is absent in Africa most of the time, tries to set a good example in `being the bigger man' for his son and his son's friend, but Christian's attitude continues to derail as his pent up anger over his mother's death pushes him to the edge.The performances are all outstanding, especially from young William Johnk Nielson, who infuses so much emotional complexity behind Christian's eyes.  Trine Dyrholm is also very good here.  I've only seen her in two films (WATCH `TROUBLED WATER' NOW!) and she's been exceptional in both.  I loved Ulrich Thomsen in Bier's marvelous `Brothers', but here I'll admit that he has little to do.  Mikael Persbrandt is extraordinary as Anton (he sounds like a Swedish Alan Rickman), developing such layered emotions as he struggles to be a father and a role model and a friend and when he begins to tamper with his own moral and ethical boundaries you can see the confliction in his soul.In the end, `In a Better World' is a beautiful film.  It has so much going for it (the score, the cinematography and the set designs are just a few of the extras that make this film completely eye-catching), I only wish that it wasn't so mechanically `exact' because it loses a bit of its heart in the process.  It becomes `expected', which takes away from the wonderment of the experience.Still, Bier is an exceptional filmmaker!",4,Sincerity and earnestness produce a very good film...,1318291200,"10 11, 2011",2011,4001,"['denying', 'message', 'brought', 'out', 'Better', 'World', 'Susanne', 'Bier', 'god', 'love', 'way', 'working', 'situations', 'actors', 'create', 'such', 'visceral', 'chemistry', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'works', 'Better', 'World', 'far', 'strongest', 'just', 'watch', 'Wedding', 'tell', ""n't"", 'one', 'single', 'greatest', 'cinematic', 'achievements', 'past', 'decade', 'dare', 'still', 'trademark', 'aura.', 'Better', 'World', 'different', 'theme', 'Bier', 'Here', 'violence', 'root', 'steady', 'escalation', 'untreated', 'anger', 'theme', 'overall', 'construction', 'elements', 'film', 'falters', 'find', 'more', 'compelling', 'lauded', 'History', 'Violence', ""n't"", 'quite', 'capture', 'unsettling', 'realities', 'violence', 'one', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'masterpieces', 'done', 'especially', 'Cache', 'Instead', 'Better', 'World', 'little', 'too', 'calculated', 'own', 'good', 'actually', 'loved', 'assessment', 'given', 'sites', 'reviewer', 'Robert', 'Horton', 'film', 'rendered', 'great', 'care', 'new', 'strand', 'plot', 'thought', 'out', 'carefully', 'placed', 'maybe', 'anything', 'slightly', 'too', 'carefully', 'placed', 'story', 'so', 'neatly', 'plotted', 'balanced', 'close', 'being', 'closed', 'system', 'concur', 'sentiment', 'film', 'so', 'obvious', 'construction', 'eventualities', 'bare', 'less', 'impact', 'would', 'was', 'element', 'surprise', 'element', 'big', 'one', 'when', 'considering', 'violence', 'act', 'Violence', 'often', 'senseless', 'careless', 'unwarranted', 'film', 'touches', 'areas', 'school', 'bullies', 'ruthless', 'warlords', ""n't"", 'allow', 'energy', 'seep', 'skin', 'picture.', 'Better', 'World', 'deals', 'dueling', 'families', 'affected', 'various', 'degrees', 'expressions', 'violence', 'Anton', 'separated', 'wife', 'Marianne', 'indiscretions', 'catch', 'up', 'Africa', 'taking', 'care', 'women', 'ravaged', 'disgusting', 'warlord', 'Marianne', 'taking', 'care', 'son', 'Elias', 'who', 'suffering', 'emotionally', 'torment', 'school', 'bully', 'Claus', 'recently', 'widowed', 'wife', 'lost', 'battle', 'cancer', 'trying', 'repair', 'relationship', 'young', 'son', 'Christian', 'who', 'witnessed', 'Elias', 'treatment', 'retaliated', 'burst', 'violence', 'left', 'tormentor', 'bruised', 'battered', 'scared', 'Christian', 'fray', 'using', 'situation', 'not', 'stepping', 'stone', 'change', 'instead', 'down', 'morbid', 'vengeful', 'spirit', 'exacting', 'revenge', 'anyone', 'who', 'unfairly', 'Anton', 'who', 'absent', 'Africa', 'most', 'time', 'tries', 'set', 'good', 'example', 'being', 'bigger', 'man', 'son', 'son', 'friend', 'Christian', 'attitude', 'derail', 'pent', 'up', 'anger', 'mother', 'death', 'edge.The', 'performances', 'are', 'outstanding', 'especially', 'young', 'William', 'Johnk', 'Nielson', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'emotional', 'complexity', 'Christian', 'eyes', 'Trine', 'Dyrholm', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'here', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'two', 'films', 'WATCH', 'TROUBLED', 'WATER', 'NOW', 'been', 'exceptional', 'loved', 'Ulrich', 'Thomsen', 'Bier', 'marvelous', 'Brothers', 'here', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'little', 'do', 'Mikael', 'Persbrandt', 'extraordinary', 'Anton', 'Swedish', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'developing', 'such', 'layered', 'emotions', 'be', 'father', 'role', 'model', 'friend', 'when', 'tamper', 'own', 'moral', 'ethical', 'boundaries', 'can', 'see', 'confliction', 'soul.In', 'end', 'Better', 'World', 'beautiful', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'score', 'cinematography', 'set', 'designs', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'extras', 'make', 'film', 'completely', 'eye-catching', 'only', 'wish', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'mechanically', 'exact', 'bit', 'heart', 'process', 'expected', 'away', 'wonderment', 'experience.Still', 'Bier', 'exceptional', 'filmmaker']",N/A

Young schoolmates Christian and Elias are dealing with very big issues&#8212;divorce, death of a parent, and bullying at school and elsewhere. As the traumas big and small begin to add up, so does the anger, and the friends contemplate a violent response. In A Better World at first seems focused on the subject of violence and some of its undeniable truths, perhaps its inscrutability being the most undeniable of all. But the film ultimately and happily is not an analysis of the convoluted subject of the whys and whens of violence. It's much more interested in giving us a glimpse into the prism through which children witness violence and exploring the role we all play in shaping that prism. This is a visually rich film with a forceful screenplay that unfolds at a brisk pace. But its most enduring scene, one that the viewer finds very difficult to forget, is one of visual simplicity and involving the deeply profound lessons and legacy a parent can pass on to a child. It's a scene of poignant grace defined by a difficulty deliberately sought out, a challenge squarely faced, an indignity kindly overlooked, all for the selfless purpose of teaching an invaluable lesson to the most pliable among us &#8230; in order to make a better world. The relevance and humanity of this film are its exploration of how parents and other adults raise children in a world full of violence and what those adults teach&#8212;by word and by deed&#8212;about how to confront adversity and the urge to respond with violence. It's not always an easy film to watch despite the gorgeous cinematography. But the &#8220;emotional blows,&#8221; as one amazon reviewer writes, &#8220;are cleansing; as the characters work toward some kind of healing, so do you.&#8221; One leaves the theater &#8220;grateful for the experience.&#8221; At its most basic, this is a film about parents raising kids, and a beautiful reminder that you don't have to be a perfect parent. In an increasingly inexplicable world, for children and adults, you just have to have the courage and the wisdom&#8212;in word and deed&#8212;to be good enough.",4,Parenting in Word and Deed,1390435200,"01 23, 2014",2014,2735,"['world', 'filled', 'violence', 'individual', 'gang', 'tribal', 'state', 'world', 'great', 'disparity', 'what', 'adults', 'say', 'what', 'adults', 'do', 'world', 'where', 'mass', 'shootings', 'have', 'become', 'daily', 'reality', 'political', 'leaders', 'say', 'answer', 'more', 'guns', 'world', 'state', 'security', 'strong', 'military', 'military', 'action', 'best', 'thing', 'individuals', 'confronting', 'violence', 'turn', 'other', 'cheek', 'world', 'where', 'children', 'see', 'bullying', 'day', 'as', 'well', 'teachers', 'who', 'do', 'nothing', 'wonder', 'kids', 'grow', 'up', 'wildly', 'confused', 'violence', 'place', 'lives', 'Young', 'Christian', 'Elias', 'are', 'dealing', 'very', 'big', 'issues', '8212', 'divorce', 'death', 'parent', 'bullying', 'school', 'elsewhere', 'traumas', 'big', 'small', 'begin', 'add', 'up', 'so', 'anger', 'friends', 'contemplate', 'violent', 'response', 'A', 'Better', 'World', 'first', 'focused', 'subject', 'violence', 'undeniable', 'truths', 'perhaps', 'inscrutability', 'being', 'most', 'undeniable', 'film', 'ultimately', 'happily', 'not', 'analysis', 'convoluted', 'subject', 'whys', 'whens', 'violence', 'much', 'more', 'interested', 'giving', 'glimpse', 'prism', 'children', 'witness', 'violence', 'exploring', 'role', 'play', 'shaping', 'prism', 'visually', 'rich', 'film', 'forceful', 'screenplay', 'brisk', 'pace', 'most', 'enduring', 'scene', 'one', 'viewer', 'finds', 'very', 'difficult', 'forget', 'one', 'visual', 'simplicity', 'involving', 'deeply', 'profound', 'lessons', 'legacy', 'parent', 'can', 'pass', 'child', 'scene', 'poignant', 'grace', 'defined', 'difficulty', 'deliberately', 'sought', 'out', 'challenge', 'squarely', 'faced', 'indignity', 'kindly', 'overlooked', 'selfless', 'purpose', 'teaching', 'invaluable', 'lesson', 'most', 'pliable', '8230', 'order', 'make', 'better', 'world', 'relevance', 'humanity', 'film', 'are', 'exploration', 'how', 'parents', 'other', 'adults', 'raise', 'children', 'world', 'full', 'violence', 'what', 'adults', 'teach', '8212', 'word', 'deed', '8212', 'how', 'confront', 'adversity', 'urge', 'respond', 'violence', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'film', 'watch', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', '8220', 'emotional', 'blows', '8221', 'one', 'amazon', 'reviewer', '8220', 'are', 'cleansing', 'characters', 'work', 'kind', 'healing', 'so', 'do', 'you.', '8221', 'One', 'theater', '8220', 'grateful', 'experience.', '8221', 'most', 'basic', 'film', 'parents', 'raising', 'kids', 'beautiful', 'reminder', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'perfect', 'parent', 'increasingly', 'inexplicable', 'world', 'children', 'adults', 'just', 'have', 'have', 'courage', 'wisdom', '8212', 'word', 'deed', '8212', 'be', 'good', 'enough']",N/A

Amith (kndy),"[1, 2]","From the award winning Danish film director Susanne Bier (""Brothers"", ""After the Wedding"", ""Things We Lost"") comes ""Hvnen"" (in Dutch which means ""Revenge"") or better known for the US release as ""In a Better World"", the Academy Award winner of the ""Best Foreign Language Film of the Year"" of 2011 but also multiple-award winning film around the world.Directed by Bier and featuring a screenplay by Anders Thomas Jensen (""The Duchess"", ""Brothers"", Adam's Apples""), the film's title ""Hvnen"" depicts the seriousness of bullying and taking revenge, ""In a Better World"" is also an appropriate but different title to show hope for the characters of the film.VIDEO:""In a Better World"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 2:35:1) and the picture quality of the film is fantastic!  From the Sudan scenes, we can see the grime, dirt and sweat on the people with great clarity.  You can see the details of the skin, natural surroundings and the same back in Denmark as we see many closeups of the character's faces.Cinematography by Morten Sborg is wonderful.  We get a good balance of artistic, beautiful shot scenes and the picture quality captures the vibrancy of the sunlight and surroundings during the daylight but also effectively showcasing the darkness of shadows and the night.Overall, picture quality is excellent for the film and I detected no artifacts, no banding, no problems whatsoever!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""In a Better World"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and French 2.0 LTRt DTS-HD MA.  The lossless audio soundtrack features a dialogue-driven track but also a beautiful score by Johan S&ouml;derqvist.  While dialogue and music come from the center and front-channels, there are moments in the film where there is good use of LFE and the surround channels.  Primarily when both Elias and Christian are using the bombs but also during the Sudanese scenes as the terrorist start driving crazily and start shooting their machine guns.So, those action moments are what you hear mostly through the surround channels, but the film is primarily dialogue-driven and is crystal clear!Subtitles are in  English, English SDH and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:""In a Better World"" comes with the following special features:Commentary with Director Susanne Bier & Editor Pernille Bech Christensen  - Featuring an in-depth commentary by director Susanne Bier and the film's editor Pernille Bech Christensen.  The two discuss the process of shooting various scenes in Denmark and Kenya and also perspectives of editing the film and more.Interview with Susanne Bier - (15:53) An interview with Susanne Bier about the film and the talent of the film.Deleted Scenes - (7:30) A total of seven deleted scenes.Trailer - (2:02) The original theatrical trailer for ""In a Better World"".EXTRAS:""In a Better World: Blu-ray + DVD Combo Pack"" comes with the Blu-ray and DVD version of the film.JUDGMENT CALL:Susanne Bier has directed a few wonderful and memorable films, but ""In a Better World"" is definitely her best film yet.""In a Better World"" is a powerful and thought-provoking film.  For one, it's a film that takes on topics of bullying but also the psychological trauma for young children who have lost a parent or parents who are in the process of divorce and the difficult choices one must make as a parent and a human being when one is bullied or when one comes across a person who inflicts harm on others.Personally, I had no idea of the bullying of Danish towards Swedes.  Watching the film, to see the Danish characters have this prejudice towards the Swedes, from the way they look and the way they talk, at first I was thinking that maybe it was a bit farfetched but with research online, I've started to learn that both Denmark and Sweden have not been the friendliest countries towards each other for over two centuries.What I loved about the film is how real it felt.  The acting of the two children Christian (played by William Johnk Nielsen) and Elias (played by Markus Rygaard) was magnificent.  With child actors playing a role where they are victimized and become somewhat of the aggressors, was quite provocative and also intriguing.  The character of Christian seems to be such a well-mannered boy until we start to learn of how much anger he has inside of him because of his mother dying of cancer and of course, the father supporting her decision to not prolong her life.For a young boy, a death of his mother is a terrible thing and you literally feel Christian's pain.  As we do with Elias, the Swedish boy who is bullied.  Elias follows Christian because he is the boy who saved his life, the boy who became his friend and because of his strength of not letting anyone hurt people.  But what Elias and Christian feel is misguided.As Anton tries to teach his children that fighting is not right, we can see why the boys are disappointed when Anton confronts the man who bullied and hit him and just stood there and took more blows.  As Anton tries to prove that no one can tear you down unless you let it.  But for the boys, what they see is visual... having gone through bullying themselves and not liking it, seeing grownups do it to another grownup is just as terrible.Even if Anton is trying to show a positive that fighting is not right, the boys find it a hard to take it in...  Why don't you call the police?  Why don't you beat him up?  Why do you let someone do that to you?And for Elias, being the meek one, he wants his father to do something about it but Elias is like his father.  Not the person to be proactive about it, but around Christian, it's like a hero willing to conquer evil.  But in this case, the stakes are too high... blowing up the aggressor's car.  Elias knows its wrong but he doesn't want to lose his friendship with Christian nor does he like what happened to his father.Meanwhile, it's an interesting juxtaposition for Elias' father Anton, in the Sudanese refugee camps, having to operate on young women who have been savagely maimed by a warlord known as the Big Man but then being forced to treat the warlord responsible for the crimes and suffering of the people.Anton struggles this.  Unlike what happened in Denmark, there is no standing up to the aggressor.And when Anton hears the jokes coming out of the Big Man's mouth about the women, men and children they have killed but most of all, to make the women he maimed and killed, making them out to be nothing but playthings and not human beings, Anton is now pushed to point where he may do something drastic, similar to what his son and Elias are planning.The Blu-ray comes with a few special features but also one very good interview along with an in-depth commentary.  The picture quality of the film is amazing on Blu-ray and the vibrant colors and detail will definitely satisfy viewers and also the film has a solid lossless soundtrack.  While the film does have its fair share of action moments that do utilize the surround channels, because of the nature of the film, it's pretty much a dialogue-driven soundtrack.""In a Better World"" is wonderful film and although I'm not sure if I can call this Susanne Bier's masterpiece, we know that the filmmaker has so much yet to give in her career and things have just gotten better and better.  But do feel that this is one extraordinary film that must be watched.Wonderfully written, wonderfully acted and one thing that I have liked is filmmaker Susanne Bier and editor Pernille Bech Christensen's working relationship as both really do compliment each other's work.  By looking at the deleted scenes and seeing how much different the film could have been if they included those scenes, I'm pretty happy that Pernille is strong enough to communicate with Susanne about scenes that needed cutting.

Not only is she able to construct stories (with the frequent close collaboration of screenwriter Anders Thomas Jensen) that define characters with multilayered personalities,  but she is also able to carry those characters into the realm of metaphors for her view of the world as she cautiously defines it. IN A BETTER WORLD is a masterpiece of cinematic achievement, blessed with a cast of Nordic actors who are masters of their craft, and photographed with sweeping panoramas as well as intense intimacy by Morten Sborg, and held together with a musical score by Johan S&ouml;derqvist. It never skips a beat.Anton (Mikael Persbrandt, in one of the most keenly fleshed out roles in years) and his wife Marianne (Trine Dyrholm) are both doctors. Anton spends the better part of his practice in the windswept poverty stricken deserts in Darfur, tending to all manner of illness but not the least of which are wounds from human conflicts (there is a warlord who has been ripping the abdomens of pregnant women who eventually himself becomes a patient of Anton).  He and Marianne are separated because of Anton's indiscretion and their children are torn between life with their mother and their too distant but very loving father. Their son Elias (Markus Rygaard) is bullied at school because he wears braces etc, and suffers quietly. His only friend is another boy named Christian (William Jhnk Nielsen), a very troubled lad whose mother has recently died form cancer: Christian blames his father Claus (Ulrich Thomsen) for wanting her to die (in truth Claus allowed his beloved wife to stop painful therapies and pass with dignity) and Christian feels an ever present need for revenge.  When Christian sees Elias being bullied he fights the brute who is hurting Elias, brandishing a knife in the fight - a fact that draws school attention to both Elias and Christian while at the same time bonding them more closely.Anton returns home, witnesses the manner in which Elias is taunted by an adult and becomes involved in evading a fight: a grim plumber slaps Anton but Anton turns his cheek.  This act ignites Christian who hates to see Elias' father not get revenge and together the boys plan to bomb the plumbers van - and act which leads to a problem that eventually brings around an understanding among all concerned - fathers and sons. There are so many sub-stories in this film that it takes a bit of distance to appreciate all the pacifist statements Bier is making.  She appears to be demonstrating on many levels how little incidents can lead to disasters much the way the differences between countries can lead to war. The beauty of Bier's message is the presentation of the complexities of love between parents and children, husbands and wives, and doctors and patients: pain and empathy fill many of the portions of the poignant dialogue of this compelling story.This film is a powerful work of art and a magnificent success for Suzanne Bier and her incredible cast of actors.

1406653,A3TXY9E0HDWMXK,B004G8QO7U,Howard Schumann,"[25, 25]","Can revenge ever be justified or does violence simply lead to an ever-widening cycle of more violence?  Should we use reason to confront an opponent or does turning the other cheek only make the problem worse? There are no easy answers in Suzanne Bier's In a Better World, winner of the Oscar for Best Foreign Film at the 2011 Oscars. It is a thought-provoking film about several subjects: bullying and how best to respond, parents who are too involved with their own problems to reach out to their children, and how the seeds of anger need to be addressed before they are acted out.Written by Anders Thomas Jensen, In a Better World, whose Danish title is translated as ""Revenge"", begins on a dusty landscape in an unnamed African country as young children run after the car of Anton (Mikael Persbrandt), a volunteer doctor at a refugee camp. Violence rears its ugly head almost immediately as we see a young pregnant woman wheeled into the camp, the victim of mutilation by a tribal warlord. Later, Anton has to face a moral dilemma when he must confront the opposition of his nurses and assistants and decide whether or not to treat the badly wounded tribal leader responsible for the death and mutilation of so many women.The scene then shifts back home in Denmark to a parallel incident (though obviously not on the same scale) where the doctor's pre-teen son, Elias (Markus Rygaard) is bullied by bigger students who call him ""rat face"" because he wears braces. The bullying is witnessed by a new boy, Christian (William Jhnk Nielsen), who has just moved from London and who is still feeling the anger over his mother's recent death from cancer and his father's perceived indifference. Christian unleashes his bottled-up anger at the bully Sofus (Simon Maagaard Holm), beating him with a bicycle pump and threatening him with a knife. Elias covers up for Christian when questioned by the police and denies that Christian had a knife.Elias and Christian begin to feel a closeness resulting from their mutual need. Elias' father is in Africa a good part of the time and not around when he needs him. To compound the problem, Anton and his wife Marianne (Trine Dyrholm) are nearing a divorce because of the father's apparent philandering. Christian, perhaps unable to realize that he is angry at his mother for dying, an issue the film does not explore, takes out his resentment on his passive father Claus (Ulrich Thomsen) who he feels lied to him when he told him that his mother would not die. He also believes his father flirted with Elias' mother and, for that reason, wanted his mother to die.In another incident, Lars (Kim Bodnia), a local garage mechanic, pushes Anton around after he breaks up a fight involving Lars' son. Though Anton later confronts Lars, he does so verbally not physically, telling the boys that Lars is a jerk and if he hit him back, he would also be a jerk. Unfortunately, the boys do not get the message of showing restraint, but think of Anton as a weakling. Together, they cook up a poorly thought-out plan to blow up Lars' van with a home-made pipe bomb, an action that inevitably compounds the problem.Though there can be differences of opinion about many of the issues raised and the film does give mixed messages, Bier makes clear the vital need for honest and open communication between parents and children. While there are candid discussions between Elias' parents about their relationship, what is lacking is the recognition that there is a vast difference between the world as perceived by children and the one seen by adults, a difference that can only be bridged by taking responsibility to provide a nurturing environment for children to become aware of and express their feelings without fear of punishment.While In a Better World is not a daring or original film, it raises issues that most Hollywood films would stay far away from. Piercing through the veil of a media culture that sells violence as the solution to problems, the film's message resonates strongly - that violence does not resolve an issue, even if on the surface it may seem otherwise.Though some aspects of the film are not completely convincing, including the ending which seems tied together too neatly, Bier's characterizations are crafted with such intelligence and sensitivity that the film overall has a strong impact, drawing performances that are so natural and emotionally resonant that any weakness in the script is easily overcome.",4,Crafted with

1406654,A1A535W556ROBQ,B004G8QO7U,James Ferguson,"[5, 10]","Revenge can have its drawbacks, as the two boys learn in this all too predictable film.  Susanne Bier sets up her movie as an allegory with the earnest seriousness of a first time filmmaker.  There are few light touches, as it seems she wants us to feel the full impact of the decisions made by her protagonists.  Fortunately, Mikael Persbrandt is able to carry off his role as idealistic doctor and father effectively.Bier attempts to explore prejudice on a number of levels, paralleling stories of Anton in what is presumably Darfur helping relieve the misery of some of the refugees.  He comes into conflict with a menacing warlord who has been terrorizing women in his region.  Anton is forced to hold to his Hippocratic Oath when the warlord appears at the remote clinic with a badly wounded leg.Meanwhile, his young son is having a difficult time coming to terms with his schoolmates.  Seems Swedish kids aren't very welcome in Danish schools, and Elias finds himself constantly abused by a bully.  One day Christian appears.  A boy who comes from a very affluent family, but is suffering from the death of his mother, apparently an American.  Unlike Elias, Christian won't take any abuse from anyone, and soon figures a way to bring the school bully down to size.  The two become uneasy friends, as Christian's problems run much deeper than Elias can imagine.Upon returning to Denmark, Anton tries to deal with the problems his son is facing, as he and his ex-wife are called into school by the well-meaning but hopelessly inept headmaster and teacher to address Elias' problems.  Anton begins to realize that the difficulties presenting themselves at home are just as vital as those in Darfur, but his passive nature doesn't rest well with Christian, who enlists Elias to seek ""revenge"" against a menacing auto mechanic.The two stories are compelling, but don't really fit together.  One quickly understands that Bier is trying to show two extremes and how each is equally important, but she takes it only so far, relying too much on imagery and meaningful looks to carry her film.",3,A little bit too earnest,1302739200,"04 14, 2011",2011,2089,"['Revenge', 'can', 'have', 'drawbacks', 'two', 'boys', 'learn', 'too', 'predictable', 'film', 'Susanne', 'Bier', 'up', 'movie', 'allegory', 'earnest', 'seriousness', 'first', 'time', 'filmmaker', 'are', 'few', 'light', 'touches', 'feel', 'full', 'impact', 'decisions', 'made', 'protagonists', 'Fortunately', 'Mikael', 'Persbrandt', 'able', 'carry', 'off', 'role', 'idealistic', 'doctor', 'father', 'effectively.Bier', 'attempts', 'explore', 'prejudice', 'number', 'levels', 'paralleling', 'stories', 'Anton', 'what', 'presumably', 'Darfur', 'helping', 'relieve', 'misery', 'refugees', 'conflict', 'menacing', 'warlord', 'who', 'been', 'terrorizing', 'women', 'region', 'Anton', 'forced', 'hold', 'Hippocratic', 'Oath', 'when', 'warlord', 'remote', 'clinic', 'badly', 'wounded', 'leg.Meanwhile', 'young', 'son', 'having', 'difficult', 'time', 'coming', 'terms', 'schoolmates', 'Seems', 'Swedish', 'kids', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'welcome', 'Danish', 'schools', 'Elias', 'constantly', 'abused', 'bully', 'One', 'day', 'Christian', 'boy', 'who', 'very', 'affluent', 'family', 'suffering', 'death', 'mother', 'apparently', 'American', 'Elias', 'Christian', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'abuse', 'anyone', 'soon', 'figures', 'way', 'bring', 'school', 'bully', 'down', 'size', 'two', 'become', 'uneasy', 'friends', 'Christian', 'problems', 'run', 'much', 'deeper', 'Elias', 'can', 'imagine.Upon', 'returning', 'Denmark', 'Anton', 'deal', 'problems', 'son', 'facing', 'ex-wife', 'are', 'called', 'school', 'well-meaning', 'hopelessly', 'inept', 'headmaster', 'teacher', 'address', 'Elias', 'problems', 'Anton', 'realize', 'difficulties', 'presenting', 'home', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'vital', 'Darfur', 'passive', 'nature', ""n't"", 'rest', 'well', 'Christian', 'who', 'Elias', 'seek', 'revenge', 'menacing', 'auto', 'mechanic.The', 'two', 'stories', 'are', 'compelling', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit', 'together', 'One', 'quickly', 'Bier', 'trying', 'show', 'two', 'extremes', 'how', 'equally', 'important', 'only', 'so', 'far', 'relying', 'too', 'much', 'imagery', 'meaningful', 'looks', 'carry', 'film']",N/A
1406655,A1725KPO7A5ULX,B004G8QO7U,"Jesse Kornbluth ""Head Butler""","[25, 26]","I saw ""In a Better World"" --- this year's winner of the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film and the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film --- in a theater with a dozen people.This was in cosmopolitan New York.The evening show on a weekday night.Depressing.Even more depressing when you consider that the director --- Susanne Bier --- is also the director of After the Wedding, an exceptional movie that was nominated for Best Foreign Film in 2007. (It lost to the German entry, ""The Lives of Others."")I don't rank film directors by the awards they get --- when I say that Ms. Bier is one of the greatest filmmakers on the planet, it's because that's what I really think. My reasons? Her movies are strong melodramas. Her actors are not beautiful in the way movie stars are beautiful --- no Botox, no surgery. The dialogue in her movies doesn't show off a screenwriter's cleverness. She doesn't telegraph the emotions she wants you to feel with music.No wonder ""In a Better World"" has grossed just $230,000 in the United States.If you stand outside a theater showing ""In a Better World"" and other movies and watch people leaving, you can easily identify who saw the Bier film --- they're the people who are silent. Slack-jawed. Maybe even weeping.How is  a Bier film different from a movie we all liked --- ""The King's Speech,"" for example? Ah, that's the thing. There's no comparison. ""The King's Speech"" is entertainment: a formula movie, a buddy film. It's ""Rocky"" --- only here the underdog is the King of England. And the moral? You've heard it a zillion times: You can make it if you try.The genius of ""The King's Speech"" is that it's methodical about the buttons it pushes --- the challenges are neatly presented, the solutions appear right on cue.The genius of Susanne Bier movies is that she pushes buttons for which there are no neat answers. And offering solutions is not her intent. She presents characters who are just like us --- that is, they're suffering and trying to make the best of it --- and you fall in love with them, in all their glorious pain, and then things start happening. And you're stuck. You're no longer watching a movie. You're living it.""In a Better World"" is about two families in Denmark.Anton and his wife Marianne are both doctors, but their marriage is failing, and Anton is away for months at a time, working in a Doctors Without Borders medical mission in Africa. Their son, Elias, is a sweet 10-year-old who is regularly bullied at school --- a fact he doesn't share with his parents.Christian is also ten. He's the son of Claus, a rich Danish businessman who has moved his family to London. But Christian's mother has recently died of cancer, and Claus has moved back to Denmark.Two boys. One victimized and confused. One grieving and enraged. Naturally they bond. Naturally, Christian comes to Elias's defense.In Danish, the title of this movie is ""Haevnen,"" which translates to ""revenge"" --- and that is what the movie is about. Life hits you with a baseball bat, and how do you respond? And if you can identify your tormentor and hit him back, then what?Christian hits back. And plans, with Elias, to do it again. And their parents? Anton has a doctor's code in Africa; he treats everyone. In Denmark, he tries to live the same way. But when he sees a kid beating another in a playground, he intervenes ---  and for his troubles, the bully's father pushes him around.It gets worse. Anton goes, with his kids, to confront that bully. The guy's a thug. He slaps Anton around. And promises more. Anton doesn't retaliate. Instead --- in a scene I guarantee you will never see in a movie financed by Hollywood --- Anton explains to the kids that the bully ""lost"" the moment he threw the first punch.Really? I often quote the line ""Don't pick up the rope"" --- but how many times can you walk away? At what point does unchallenged bullying become evil? Should we be so above the fray that a monster can march us into a concentration camp? Where do we draw a line?The people --- I hesitate to call them ""characters"" --- in Bier's movie fumble with these issues. Because Bier is a ruthlessly efficient director, they don't talk much. They act. Things happen. Things go wrong.Do you remember that scene in ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" when Dustin Hoffman's son has an accident in Central Park and Hoffman grabs him and runs with him to the emergency room? Your heart was, as they say, in your mouth; your eyes misted. There's a scene in this movie that has that feeling. No disrespect to Dustin Hoffman or his director, Robert Benton --- this scene is better.Over and over. my wife and I groaned as we watched ""In a Better World."" Groaned because we were watching scenes like no others and had no defense against the novelty. Groaned because we identified so strongly with the people, because we shared their hurt and confusion.No one heard us --- as I say, we were almost alone in the theater. As you will be if you go to see ""In a Better World."" Those emotional blows, you will find, are cleansing; as the characters work toward some kind of healing, so do you. And when they get to the end, so do you.Yes, you leave the theater battered. But also relieved. And smarter. And grateful for the experience.I'd drive a hundred miles, if I had to, to see ""In a Better World."" If you don't live in New York, that's what you might have to do. Don't even think about the price of gas.

The acting is superb - the lead Characters, (Mikael Persbrandt, Anton) and the two boys, (William Johnk Neilsen, Christian) and (Markus Rygaard, Elias), are perfect in their roles. It is well worth the time, (two hours) spent watching it.Plot: Anton (Mikael Persbrandt) is a Swedish doctor who commutes between his home in Denmark and his work in a Sudanese refugee camp. In Sudan, he often treats female patients who are the victims of a sadistic warlord. Anton is married to Marianne (Trine Dyrholm), but they are separated, and struggling with the possibility of divorce over an affair that Anton had with another woman. They have two young sons, the older one being 12-year-old Elias (Markus Rygaard).Christian (William Jhnk Juels Nielsen), who has just moved from London with his father, Claus (Ulrich Thomsen), is a new boy at Elias' school. Christian's mother recently died from cancer, and Christian blames his father for lying to him that she would get well, and that, in a late stage of her disease, he ""wanted"" her to die. Elias is bullied at school, until he is defended by Christian, who assaults the main bully and threatens him with a knife. Christian gives Elias the knife, and both boys lie to the police, and their parents, about the incident.When Anton separates his younger son from another child, while they are fighting at a playground, the father of the other child, a mechanic, tells Anton not to touch his child and slaps Anton in the face. Anton later visits the mechanic at his work, accompanied by his children and Christian, to discuss the matter, and to show the children that he is not afraid of the man. The mechanic slaps Anton several more times, who does not flinch from the blows.Later, in Sudan, the warlord comes to Anton's hospital for treatment of his wounded leg. To the horror of his staff and others, Anton treats the man, after demanding that no weapons, and only two of his guards, are allowed inside the hospital. However, after the warlord shows contempt for one of his victims, Anton drags him away from the clinic, allowing him to be beaten to death by local people.In Denmark, Christian and Elias decide to make a bomb to destroy the mechanic's car, on a Sunday morning so no passers-by are hurt. However, with the fuse already burning, they see two joggers approaching (a mother and her young daughter), and Elias leaves his protected position to warn them. He is knocked unconscious, but saves the joggers from harm. Christian is questioned by the police and then released, with the incident being addressed as an extreme case of vandalism. He goes to the hospital to visit Elias, but Marianne does not let him see the boy, instead telling him that he has killed her son. Christian, believing that Elias is dead, climbs to the roof of a silo, contemplating suicide, but is rescued by Anton. Christian is relieved that Elias is doing well, and he is now allowed to visit him.Christian reconciles with his father, and Anton and Marianne have sex, apparently resuming their marriage.",5,Wonderful Movie,1387843200,"12 24, 2013",2013,3176,"['terrifically', 'made', 'movie', 'well', 'deserved', 'awards', 'received', 'especially', '2011', 'Academy', 'award', 'best', 'Foreign', 'film', 'acting', 'superb', 'lead', 'Characters', 'Mikael', 'Persbrandt', 'Anton', 'two', 'boys', 'William', 'Johnk', 'Neilsen', 'Christian', 'Markus', 'Rygaard', 'Elias', 'are', 'perfect', 'roles', 'well', 'time', 'two', 'hours', 'spent', 'watching', 'it.Plot', 'Anton', 'Mikael', 'Persbrandt', 'Swedish', 'doctor', 'who', 'home', 'Denmark', 'work', 'Sudanese', 'refugee', 'camp', 'Sudan', 'often', 'female', 'patients', 'who', 'are', 'victims', 'sadistic', 'warlord', 'Anton', 'married', 'Marianne', 'Trine', 'Dyrholm', 'are', 'separated', 'struggling', 'possibility', 'divorce', 'affair', 'Anton', 'had', 'woman', 'have', 'two', 'young', 'sons', 'older', 'one', 'being', '12-year-old', 'Elias', 'Markus', 'Rygaard', '.Christian', 'William', 'Jhnk', 'Juels', 'Nielsen', 'who', 'just', 'moved', 'London', 'father', 'Claus', 'Ulrich', 'Thomsen', 'new', 'boy', 'Elias', 'school', 'Christian', 'mother', 'recently', 'died', 'cancer', 'Christian', 'father', 'lying', 'would', 'get', 'well', 'late', 'stage', 'disease', 'wanted', 'die', 'Elias', 'bullied', 'school', 'defended', 'Christian', 'who', 'assaults', 'main', 'bully', 'knife', 'Christian', 'Elias', 'knife', 'boys', 'lie', 'police', 'parents', 'incident.When', 'Anton', 'younger', 'son', 'child', 'are', 'fighting', 'playground', 'father', 'other', 'child', 'mechanic', 'Anton', 'not', 'touch', 'child', 'slaps', 'Anton', 'face', 'Anton', 'later', 'mechanic', 'work', 'accompanied', 'children', 'Christian', 'discuss', 'matter', 'show', 'children', 'not', 'afraid', 'man', 'mechanic', 'slaps', 'Anton', 'several', 'more', 'times', 'who', 'not', 'flinch', 'blows.Later', 'Sudan', 'warlord', 'Anton', 'hospital', 'treatment', 'wounded', 'leg', 'horror', 'staff', 'others', 'Anton', 'man', 'demanding', 'weapons', 'only', 'two', 'guards', 'are', 'allowed', 'hospital', 'However', 'warlord', 'contempt', 'one', 'victims', 'Anton', 'away', 'clinic', 'allowing', 'be', 'beaten', 'death', 'local', 'people.In', 'Denmark', 'Christian', 'Elias', 'decide', 'make', 'bomb', 'destroy', 'mechanic', 'car', 'Sunday', 'morning', 'so', 'passers-by', 'are', 'hurt', 'However', 'fuse', 'already', 'burning', 'see', 'two', 'joggers', 'approaching', 'mother', 'young', 'daughter', 'Elias', 'protected', 'position', 'warn', 'knocked', 'unconscious', 'joggers', 'harm', 'Christian', 'questioned', 'police', 'then', 'released', 'incident', 'being', 'addressed', 'extreme', 'case', 'vandalism', 'hospital', 'visit', 'Elias', 'Marianne', 'not', 'let', 'see', 'boy', 'instead', 'telling', 'killed', 'son', 'Christian', 'believing', 'Elias', 'dead', 'climbs', 'roof', 'silo', 'contemplating', 'suicide', 'rescued', 'Anton', 'Christian', 'relieved', 'Elias', 'doing', 'well', 'now', 'allowed', 'visit', 'him.Christian', 'reconciles', 'father', 'Anton', 'Marianne', 'have', 'sex', 'apparently', 'resuming', 'marriage']",N/A

Mikael Persbrandt stars as a Swedish medical doctor who splits his time with his family in an exclusive area of Denmark and a refugee camp in central Africa (filmed in Kenya).  The older of his two sons, Elias (Markus Rygaard) is about 11 and is bullied at school primarily because he's Swedish.  His marriage is ending because of a previous affair.Another family has recently relocated to Denmark from London.  Claus (Ulrich Thornsen) is a wealthy businessman but decides to move in with his elderly mother on a large rural estate along with his son, Christian (William Johnk Nielsen). His wife had recently died of cancer after a lengthy battle.  Christian seems to be dealing with the death of his mother well, but the hardened outer shell is hiding his grief.  He blames his father to some degree for his mother's death.The two boys become friends when Christian comes to Elias's aide as a bully corners him in a bathroom.  Christian beats the bully senseless with a bicycle pump and threatens his life with a knife.  At this point part of me says good, that's what he deserved; but there is a deeper concern when Christian doesn't let up.  Is this the root of an emerging psychopath?The film centers on the relationship between the two men and their sons but Trine Dyrholm gives a strong performance as Elias's mother Marianne.  Christian's violence escalates and he brings Elias along for the ride.  It gets out of hand when a pipe bomb is crafted with help from the internet, and the boys blow up the van of an adult thug who had previously assaulted Anton (Persbrandt).This is an extremely effective film that is well written and acted.  Persbrandt is particularly good as his character is conflicted and loaded with guilt.  The photography is excellent with some nice interiors combining with the lush countryside of Denmark and the starkness of Kenya.  The Blu ray picture is very good.

1406660,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B004G8QO7U,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[10, 13]","Why are Scandinavians so hell-bent on persuading us their societies are miserable and dysfunctional? When's someone going to put out a Scandi Rom-Com? (You will get precisely four Google hits should you search for ""Danish Rom-Com"" - all refer to the same film, Italian for Beginners - apparently very good, but having the misfortune to be released the week of 9/11.)Well, if a Danish film entitled In A Better World fills you with expectation the drought might finally have broken, save your money. It is, instead, a pretty harrowing drama, beautifully staged and acted, as close in tone as I can think to Swedish Romantic-Horror LetLet The Right One In. Which is to say, grim.The opening titles are projected downward onto a scene of sandy African hinterland cropped in such a way that it might be a close up of a banana. From there we open on a painterly tableau: a sweeping African landscape vaulted over by a heaving, boiling sky. The locale of the film switches between here and autumnal, coastal Denmark, between which Anton, a field doctor divides his time.We also have parallel stories: Elias, Anton's son, is bullied at school. His home is also fractured: not only because Anton spends most of his time in an African refugee camp, but also because Anton's marriage is falling apart.Christian is a new boy in Elias' school, transplanted out of a wealthy London boarding school following his mother's death from cancer. We first meet Christian as he flawlessly, but coldly, delivers his mother's eulogy over her coffin. In an early playground confrontation he comes to Elias' aid and reveals himself as a fearless child with a destructive streak. Elias - quite the opposite - can't believe his luck to have found a protector and latches onto him like a remora. Christian is a passable shark.Meantime, Anton continent-hops and deals with his own sort of bullying: there are unpleasant goings on in the refugee camp, courtesy of a sadistic local war lord, who has been creating most of the trauma patients in Anton's clinic. Anton has a principled, but unworldly, commitment to the hypocratic oath, even if that means healing the war lord when he suffers an infected wound. Anton is bullied also back in Denmark, where he is as much of an outsider as he is in Africa: he's Swede.So, nicely set up: we have fractures and bifurcations everywhere you look: between Denmark and Africa; between husband and wife; between Anton's theory and the boys' practice. But all under the same, brooding sky - a visual repeatedly imposed on the screenplay: for all the localised fractures everything is part of a continuum: everything is under the sun. Well, clouds, at any rate.The drama is very tightly worked and the pacing is perfect: whenever the pot nears the boil, we cut between Denmark and Africa so as to delay gratification, and the suspense keeps growing. Michael Persbrandt plays the Anton well, with fittingly piecing blue eyes. The children leads are terrific too: Markus Rygaard captures the eager but guileless Elias and William Johnk Nielsen is excellently cast as the scowling Christian.As the premise implies, events set a course for tragedy and make all haste getting there: the family bonds in each family have worked themselves loose enough to be unable to avert disaster. This, I think, is Susanne Bier's industry: to investigate how the western veneer of settled social organisation (perfectly exemplified by the social democrat Scandinavians) doesn't need much of a scratch to come apart.Anton's moment of revelation comes as his war lord, healed, shows no sign of remorse or gratitude and he realises there is a limit to philosophical theorising in the face of a nasty, brutish and short life. I doubt such a credulous or idealistic European would last long in that sort of environment in real life, but as a narrative device it works well.Bier's conclusion, which I won't spoil, struck me as a little pat, but in the round this is a clever, tense, and well produced drama.Olly Buxton",4,Not a Scandinavian Rom Com,1313625600,"08 18, 2011",2011,4000,"['Why', 'are', 'Scandinavians', 'so', 'hell-bent', 'persuading', 'societies', 'are', 'miserable', 'dysfunctional', 'When', 'someone', 'going', 'put', 'out', 'Scandi', 'Rom-Com', 'will', 'get', 'precisely', 'four', 'Google', 'hits', 'should', 'search', 'Danish', 'Rom-Com', 'refer', 'same', 'film', 'Italian', 'Beginners', 'apparently', 'very', 'good', 'having', 'misfortune', 'be', 'released', 'week', '9/11', 'Well', 'Danish', 'film', 'entitled', 'A', 'Better', 'World', 'expectation', 'drought', 'might', 'finally', 'have', 'broken', 'save', 'money', 'instead', 'pretty', 'harrowing', 'drama', 'beautifully', 'staged', 'acted', 'close', 'tone', 'can', 'think', 'Swedish', 'Romantic-Horror', 'LetLet', 'Right', 'One', 'Which', 'say', 'grim.The', 'opening', 'titles', 'are', 'projected', 'downward', 'scene', 'sandy', 'African', 'hinterland', 'cropped', 'such', 'way', 'might', 'be', 'close', 'banana', 'open', 'painterly', 'tableau', 'sweeping', 'African', 'landscape', 'vaulted', 'heaving', 'boiling', 'sky', 'locale', 'film', 'switches', 'here', 'autumnal', 'coastal', 'Denmark', 'Anton', 'field', 'doctor', 'time.We', 'also', 'have', 'parallel', 'stories', 'Elias', 'Anton', 'son', 'bullied', 'school', 'home', 'also', 'fractured', 'not', 'only', 'Anton', 'most', 'time', 'African', 'refugee', 'camp', 'also', 'Anton', 'marriage', 'falling', 'apart.Christian', 'new', 'boy', 'Elias', 'school', 'transplanted', 'wealthy', 'London', 'boarding', 'school', 'following', 'mother', 'death', 'cancer', 'first', 'meet', 'Christian', 'flawlessly', 'coldly', 'mother', 'eulogy', 'coffin', 'early', 'playground', 'confrontation', 'Elias', 'aid', 'reveals', 'fearless', 'child', 'destructive', 'streak', 'Elias', 'quite', 'opposite', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'luck', 'have', 'found', 'protector', 'latches', 'remora', 'Christian', 'passable', 'shark.Meantime', 'Anton', 'continent-hops', 'deals', 'own', 'sort', 'bullying', 'are', 'unpleasant', 'goings', 'refugee', 'camp', 'courtesy', 'sadistic', 'local', 'war', 'lord', 'who', 'been', 'creating', 'most', 'trauma', 'patients', 'Anton', 'clinic', 'Anton', 'principled', 'unworldly', 'commitment', 'hypocratic', 'oath', 'even', 'healing', 'war', 'lord', 'when', 'infected', 'wound', 'Anton', 'bullied', 'also', 'back', 'Denmark', 'where', 'as', 'much', 'outsider', 'Africa', 'Swede.So', 'nicely', 'set', 'up', 'have', 'fractures', 'bifurcations', 'everywhere', 'look', 'Denmark', 'Africa', 'husband', 'wife', 'Anton', 'theory', 'boys', 'practice', 'same', 'brooding', 'sky', 'visual', 'repeatedly', 'imposed', 'screenplay', 'localised', 'fractures', 'everything', 'part', 'continuum', 'everything', 'sun', 'Well', 'clouds', 'rate.The', 'drama', 'very', 'tightly', 'worked', 'pacing', 'perfect', 'whenever', 'pot', 'boil', 'cut', 'Denmark', 'Africa', 'so', 'delay', 'gratification', 'suspense', 'growing', 'Michael', 'Persbrandt', 'Anton', 'well', 'fittingly', 'piecing', 'blue', 'eyes', 'children', 'leads', 'are', 'terrific', 'too', 'Markus', 'Rygaard', 'eager', 'guileless', 'Elias', 'William', 'Johnk', 'Nielsen', 'excellently', 'cast', 'scowling', 'Christian.As', 'premise', 'implies', 'events', 'set', 'course', 'tragedy', 'make', 'haste', 'getting', 'there', 'family', 'bonds', 'family', 'have', 'worked', 'loose', 'enough', 'be', 'unable', 'avert', 'disaster', 'think', 'Susanne', 'Bier', 'industry', 'investigate', 'how', 'western', 'veneer', 'settled', 'social', 'organisation', 'perfectly', 'exemplified', 'social', 'democrat', 'Scandinavians', ""n't"", 'need', 'much', 'scratch', 'come', 'apart.Anton', 'moment', 'revelation', 'war', 'lord', 'healed', 'sign', 'remorse', 'gratitude', 'limit', 'philosophical', 'theorising', 'face', 'nasty', 'brutish', 'short', 'life', 'doubt', 'credulous', 'idealistic', 'European', 'would', 'last', 'long', 'sort', 'environment', 'real', 'life', 'narrative', 'device', 'well.Bier', 'conclusion', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'struck', 'little', 'pat', 'round', 'clever', 'tense', 'well', 'produced', 'drama.Olly', 'Buxton']",N/A

1406662,A39W3263A9HCMN,B004G8QO7U,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[0, 2]","First off, Suzanne Brier has such a gorgeous sense of eye-for-a-shot, that even if you don't like this rather frustrating Danish melodrama, the viewing experience is worth it based on the strength of the cinematography alone. I haven't seen any if Brier's previous movies, so I guess I can't say much about her as a storyteller there, but I will say that this film, for the most part, is a well-crafted story that at the same time, should have been bette.In a Better World won best foreign picture at the Oscars this year. I only saw one other movie nominated, Incendies, so I guess I can't say much about whether or not this movie deserved the Oscar, but it is more worthwhile than Incendies. And like I said, it's a good movie for the most part, provided you're prepared to finish the movie feeling rather frustrated.In a Better World follows Anton, a Swedish doctor who lives two lives; one being helping injured people in Africa (and we do get a good look into how he does this), and taking care of his two children at home in Denmark. He has recently split from his wife, who also helps take care of the children. His son has trouble with bullying in school, and encounters a few boys who call him names such as ""rat face"".Elias soon befriends Christian, a boy who has lived all over the world, and most recently has lived in London. Christian beats up one of the bullies in the boys room, who threatens Elias and constantly harassed him. After dealing with then police about it, they become friends, and hang out a lot, when one day they notice their dad breaking up a fight between his two small children. They suggest he gets back at him, but the dad refuses. Further encounters lead to a diabolical plan of Christian's: he wants to blow up the man's van.So let me start off by saying this film is, for the most part, well acted and shot. It avoids pretension, which is a breath of fresh air. I hate to sound prejudiced, because I'm not, but more often than not, a lot of European cinema does tend to be rather pretentious, and thankfully this isnt the case here.The movie, like I said earlier, is gorgeously shot. I saw it on blu-ray, and it does have a gorgeous look. The constant scenic shots of Africa, the sweeping shots of the lake house, etc. they all look very pretty. This is one of the few good uses of digital cinematography in a while, almost to the point where it's not noticeable that the movie was shot digitally. The acting is well done, especially from Christian. His English in the opening scene was well done, and his role as a confused kid who thinks violence is always the answer was well done too.What makes this movie so frustrating, though, is that it seems to lack any clear focus. You may have noticed that I devoted two entire paragraphs to descriptions of the plot. It is rather unfocused and despite being well written, seems to jump all over the place a bit. Also, I didn't like the third act, mainly for the fact that it just plays it too safe and thus proving that the movie rarely ever goes for broke. had the writers taken more risks with the plot, perhaps I'd have enjoyed the movie more. In fact, dare I say it, it almost seems like a recipe for an Oscar winning movie.So in spite of all this, why did I give this a 7/10? The way the movie looks and feels was enough to warrant the rating alone. It's not a perfect movie, which is rather a frustration because this film did have potential to become a future classic, but for what we got, I'd say it's good enough... provided you don't look too far into it.OVERALL: 7/10PROS: Great performances, beautiful cinematography and nice cinematography make the film worth the price of admission.CONS: The film rarely ever goes for broke. When the opportunity to take a good risk comes, it misses it. Also, the film wraps up a bit too conveniently.",4,The age of innocence is fading like an old dream...,1316304000,"09 18, 2011",2011,3833,"['First', 'off', 'Suzanne', 'Brier', 'gorgeous', 'sense', 'eye-for-a-shot', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'rather', 'frustrating', 'Danish', 'melodrama', 'viewing', 'experience', 'based', 'strength', 'cinematography', 'alone', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Brier', 'previous', 'movies', 'guess', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'storyteller', 'there', 'will', 'say', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'well-crafted', 'story', 'same', 'time', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Better', 'World', 'won', 'best', 'foreign', 'picture', 'Oscars', 'year', 'only', 'saw', 'one', 'other', 'movie', 'nominated', 'Incendies', 'guess', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'not', 'movie', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'Incendies', 'said', 'good', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'provided', ""'re"", 'prepared', 'finish', 'movie', 'feeling', 'rather', 'frustrated.In', 'Better', 'World', 'Anton', 'Swedish', 'doctor', 'who', 'two', 'lives', 'one', 'being', 'helping', 'injured', 'people', 'Africa', 'do', 'get', 'good', 'look', 'how', 'taking', 'care', 'two', 'children', 'home', 'Denmark', 'recently', 'split', 'wife', 'who', 'also', 'take', 'care', 'children', 'son', 'trouble', 'bullying', 'school', 'few', 'boys', 'who', 'call', 'names', 'such', 'rat', 'face', 'soon', 'befriends', 'Christian', 'boy', 'who', 'lived', 'world', 'most', 'recently', 'lived', 'London', 'Christian', 'up', 'one', 'bullies', 'boys', 'room', 'who', 'Elias', 'constantly', 'harassed', 'dealing', 'then', 'police', 'become', 'friends', 'hang', 'out', 'lot', 'when', 'one', 'day', 'notice', 'dad', 'breaking', 'up', 'fight', 'two', 'small', 'children', 'suggest', 'back', 'dad', 'Further', 'encounters', 'lead', 'diabolical', 'plan', 'Christian', 'blow', 'up', 'man', 'van.So', 'let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'well', 'acted', 'shot', 'pretension', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'hate', 'sound', 'prejudiced', ""'m"", 'not', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'lot', 'European', 'cinema', 'tend', 'be', 'rather', 'pretentious', 'thankfully', 'case', 'here.The', 'movie', 'said', 'earlier', 'gorgeously', 'shot', 'saw', 'blu-ray', 'have', 'gorgeous', 'look', 'constant', 'scenic', 'shots', 'Africa', 'sweeping', 'shots', 'lake', 'house', 'etc', 'look', 'very', 'pretty', 'one', 'few', 'good', 'uses', 'digital', 'cinematography', 'while', 'almost', 'point', 'where', 'not', 'noticeable', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'digitally', 'acting', 'well', 'done', 'especially', 'Christian', 'English', 'opening', 'scene', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'role', 'confused', 'kid', 'who', 'violence', 'always', 'answer', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'too.What', 'movie', 'so', 'frustrating', 'though', 'lack', 'clear', 'focus', 'may', 'have', 'noticed', 'devoted', 'two', 'entire', 'paragraphs', 'descriptions', 'plot', 'rather', 'unfocused', 'being', 'well', 'written', 'jump', 'place', 'bit', 'Also', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'third', 'act', 'mainly', 'fact', 'just', 'too', 'safe', 'thus', 'proving', 'movie', 'rarely', 'ever', 'broke', 'had', 'writers', 'taken', 'more', 'risks', 'plot', 'perhaps', ""'d"", 'have', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'more', 'fact', 'dare', 'say', 'almost', 'recipe', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'movie.So', 'spite', 'why', 'did', 'give', '7/10', 'way', 'movie', 'feels', 'was', 'enough', 'warrant', 'rating', 'alone', 'not', 'perfect', 'movie', 'rather', 'frustration', 'film', 'did', 'have', 'potential', 'become', 'future', 'classic', 'what', 'got', ""'d"", 'say', 'good', 'enough', 'provided', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'too', 'far', 'it.OVERALL', '7/10PROS', 'Great', 'performances', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'nice', 'cinematography', 'make', 'film', 'price', 'admission.CONS', 'film', 'rarely', 'ever', 'broke', 'When', 'opportunity', 'take', 'good', 'risk', 'Also', 'film', 'up', 'bit', 'too', 'conveniently']",N/A

Its underlying theme is social violence in different forms and the moral question of how to respond to it most effectively. The film's title in the original Danish translates as `The Revenge'.Mikael Persbrandt plays Anton, a Swedish surgeon vocationally devoted to charity work in a Sudanese refugee camp whose occasional visits to his middle-class Danish home are punctuated by marital difficulties with wife Marianne (a superb Trine Dyrholm), and trying to be a role model to his two young sons. The elder son Elias (played by the excellent and promising young Markus Rygaard) is bullied at school because he's Swedish - a recurrent theme in other Danish films over the years so presumably a persistent if minor social problem in Denmark - and befriended and protected by another boy, Christian, who has a strong sense of righteous moral justice but harbours a worryingly violent streak bordering on the psychotic.Only-child Christian has recently moved to the locality from London with his bereaved father, Claus (played in an understated performance by Ulrich Thomsen). Christian's mother died of cancer following a long degenerative illness and although both father and son seem to be coping well on the surface deeper wounds lie beneath, to be uncovered as the story unfolds.The film contrasts differing responses to confronting violence, by the idealistic and mature Anton who essentially tries to live by a `Turn the other cheek' attitude of moral superiority; with the visceral, clear certainties of the vengeful young Christian, and the consequences for those around them as the inevitable results of their actions develop. In parallel, a civilized, well-ordered modern European society like Denmark ruled by law and social contract are contrasted with the wild, dangerous chaos of parts of the world where brutal warlord gang violence is, de facto, the local law-and-order. The film demonstrates Anton's western moral principles are doomed to fail in this environment and that a harder line of `natural justice' as understood by the local culture is the only thing which is going to work.The editing is first-rate, with not a superfluous line of dialog or unnecessary scene. The only criticism of the film with merit might be that the denouement is perhaps too trite, the happy-ending-of-sorts where everything is resolved not entirely convincing. However, this is a small criticism in an excellent piece of work and if you like serious, thoughtful non-Hollywood films don't be put off by the Danish dialog: see it.",4,Susanne Bier's well-deserved Oscar winner has serious themes & makes you think,1340236800,"06 21, 2012",2012,2712,"['Danish', 'director', 'Susanne', 'Bier', '2010', 'Oscar-winner', 'finely', 'written', 'intelligently', 'scripted', 'piece', 'work', 'full', 'superb', 'acting', 'especially', 'two', 'children', 'main', 'characters', 'underlying', 'theme', 'social', 'violence', 'different', 'forms', 'moral', 'question', 'how', 'respond', 'most', 'effectively', 'film', 'title', 'original', 'Danish', 'translates', ""Revenge'.Mikael"", 'Persbrandt', 'Anton', 'Swedish', 'surgeon', 'vocationally', 'devoted', 'charity', 'work', 'Sudanese', 'refugee', 'camp', 'occasional', 'visits', 'middle-class', 'Danish', 'home', 'are', 'punctuated', 'marital', 'difficulties', 'wife', 'Marianne', 'superb', 'Trine', 'Dyrholm', 'trying', 'be', 'role', 'model', 'two', 'young', 'sons', 'elder', 'son', 'Elias', 'played', 'excellent', 'promising', 'young', 'Markus', 'Rygaard', 'bullied', 'school', 'Swedish', 'recurrent', 'theme', 'other', 'Danish', 'films', 'years', 'so', 'presumably', 'persistent', 'minor', 'social', 'problem', 'Denmark', 'befriended', 'protected', 'boy', 'Christian', 'who', 'strong', 'sense', 'righteous', 'moral', 'justice', 'worryingly', 'violent', 'streak', 'bordering', 'psychotic.Only-child', 'Christian', 'recently', 'moved', 'locality', 'London', 'bereaved', 'father', 'Claus', 'played', 'understated', 'performance', 'Ulrich', 'Thomsen', 'Christian', 'mother', 'died', 'cancer', 'following', 'long', 'degenerative', 'illness', 'father', 'son', 'seem', 'be', 'coping', 'well', 'surface', 'deeper', 'lie', 'beneath', 'be', 'uncovered', 'story', 'unfolds.The', 'film', 'contrasts', 'differing', 'responses', 'confronting', 'violence', 'idealistic', 'mature', 'Anton', 'who', 'essentially', 'live', 'Turn', 'other', 'cheek', 'attitude', 'moral', 'superiority', 'visceral', 'clear', 'certainties', 'vengeful', 'young', 'Christian', 'consequences', 'around', 'inevitable', 'results', 'actions', 'develop', 'parallel', 'civilized', 'well-ordered', 'modern', 'European', 'society', 'Denmark', 'ruled', 'law', 'social', 'contract', 'are', 'contrasted', 'wild', 'dangerous', 'chaos', 'parts', 'world', 'where', 'brutal', 'warlord', 'gang', 'violence', 'de', 'facto', 'local', 'law-and-order', 'film', 'Anton', 'western', 'moral', 'principles', 'are', 'doomed', 'fail', 'environment', 'harder', 'line', 'natural', 'justice', 'understood', 'local', 'culture', 'only', 'thing', 'going', 'work.The', 'editing', 'first-rate', 'not', 'superfluous', 'line', 'dialog', 'unnecessary', 'scene', 'only', 'criticism', 'film', 'merit', 'might', 'be', 'denouement', 'perhaps', 'too', 'trite', 'happy-ending-of-sorts', 'where', 'everything', 'resolved', 'not', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'However', 'small', 'criticism', 'excellent', 'piece', 'work', 'like', 'serious', 'thoughtful', 'non-Hollywood', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'off', 'Danish', 'dialog', 'see']",N/A
1406667,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B004G8QO7U,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 5]","""In a Better World,"" an Oscar-winning Danish-Swedish drama (Best Foreign Language Film for 2010), follows two thematically-related stories set in different locations: Africa and Denmark. Anton (Mikael Persbrandt) is a Swedish doctor who had moved to Denmark, but now lives in Africa as a dedicated member of a group providing medical services in a refugee camp. But the people in the camp are horrified by ""Big Man,"" a sadistic warlord cutting up pregnant women.In the meanwhile, Anton's son Elias (Markus Rygaard) and a new boy at school Christian (William Jhnk Juels Nielsen) become friends when Christian beats up a schoolboy bullying Elias. Christian's mother recently died of cancer, and the strained relationship with his father Claus (Ulrich Thomsen) is not getting better.Then two things happen: Anton is humiliated by a mechanic Lars (Kim Bodnia), who slaps him in the face, and though Anton tells the boys to ignore him, Christian disagrees. (The Danish film's original title ""Hvnen"" means ""revenge."") And in Africa, when the ""Big Man,"" now severely injured, is brought to the camp, an idealist Anton's belief is tested.The plot gets markedly melodramatic as the film moves into the second half, where the two boys and their parents have to face the consequences of their actions. Acting is unanimously strong, especially from the two boys, and director Susanne Bier handles the convoluted story skillfully.Or maybe she does it too skillfully. The film wraps everything up too neatly, and while we understand the point she is trying to make by juxtaposing two events at totally different places, I'm afraid the melodramatic narrative may be oversimplifying the complexity of the issues the film is dealing with.Like her previous works (including ""After the Wedding"" and ""Brothers""), Susanne Bier tells us a story of people in an extraordinary situation, and she is quite good at it. These stories are often very emotional but not sentimental. Flawed as it is, ""In a Better Place"" is a compelling drama with believable characters.",4,Revenge and Forgiveness: Melodramatic and Compelling,1317427200,"10 1, 2011",2011,2039,"['Better', 'World', 'Oscar-winning', 'Danish-Swedish', 'drama', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Language', 'Film', '2010', 'two', 'thematically-related', 'stories', 'set', 'different', 'locations', 'Africa', 'Denmark', 'Anton', 'Mikael', 'Persbrandt', 'Swedish', 'doctor', 'who', 'had', 'moved', 'Denmark', 'now', 'Africa', 'dedicated', 'member', 'group', 'providing', 'medical', 'services', 'refugee', 'camp', 'people', 'camp', 'are', 'horrified', 'Big', 'Man', 'sadistic', 'warlord', 'cutting', 'up', 'pregnant', 'meanwhile', 'Anton', 'son', 'Elias', 'Markus', 'Rygaard', 'new', 'boy', 'school', 'Christian', 'William', 'Jhnk', 'Juels', 'Nielsen', 'become', 'friends', 'when', 'Christian', 'up', 'schoolboy', 'bullying', 'Elias', 'Christian', 'mother', 'recently', 'died', 'cancer', 'strained', 'relationship', 'father', 'Claus', 'Ulrich', 'Thomsen', 'not', 'getting', 'better.Then', 'two', 'things', 'happen', 'Anton', 'humiliated', 'mechanic', 'Lars', 'Kim', 'Bodnia', 'who', 'slaps', 'face', 'Anton', 'boys', 'ignore', 'Christian', 'Danish', 'film', 'original', 'title', 'Hvnen', 'revenge', 'Africa', 'when', 'Big', 'Man', 'now', 'severely', 'injured', 'brought', 'camp', 'idealist', 'Anton', 'belief', 'tested.The', 'plot', 'markedly', 'melodramatic', 'film', 'second', 'half', 'where', 'two', 'boys', 'parents', 'have', 'face', 'consequences', 'actions', 'Acting', 'unanimously', 'strong', 'especially', 'two', 'boys', 'director', 'Susanne', 'Bier', 'convoluted', 'story', 'skillfully.Or', 'maybe', 'too', 'skillfully', 'film', 'wraps', 'everything', 'up', 'too', 'neatly', 'understand', 'point', 'trying', 'make', 'juxtaposing', 'two', 'events', 'totally', 'different', 'places', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'melodramatic', 'narrative', 'may', 'be', 'oversimplifying', 'complexity', 'issues', 'film', 'dealing', 'previous', 'works', 'including', 'Wedding', 'Brothers', 'Susanne', 'Bier', 'story', 'people', 'extraordinary', 'situation', 'quite', 'good', 'stories', 'are', 'often', 'very', 'emotional', 'not', 'sentimental', 'Flawed', 'Better', 'Place', 'compelling', 'drama', 'believable', 'characters']",N/A
