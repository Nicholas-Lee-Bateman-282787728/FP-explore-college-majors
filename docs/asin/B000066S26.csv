The world in in ruins most likely due to a war or some other catastrophe.  We are introduced to a tribal community that has some disturbed philosophical ideas about population growth.  The more people the angrier god will become.  However, the priest that is spouting it off seems to be having sex with whatever he wants.  Anyways some rebellious(sterotypical) kid kills his father, the preist, and ends up exiled.  Well his ignorant(sterotypical) friends follow.  At this point of watching the movie it didn't have much going for it.  I thought maybe Clark was going to make it funny but the laughter never came or I thought maybe it will get scary it never did that either.  This movie is really a downgrade to the entire movie industry not only is the storyline shot, but the acting is terrible as well.  Some parts of the movie made me feel like I was watching a cheep, no very cheep, porno flick(and I am not over exaggerating).If you are familiar with Larry Clark's other movies you will know he presents us things in a blunt manner it is just most of his other movies have some substance(and storyline) where this one has none.

There is one religious hypocritical nut who teaches people to read.  To make it fun, they learn to read out of Penthouse magazines. A select few rebel and run off from their camp in search of better things. The stumble upon an abandoned city, a lifeless New York. A storm comes in and they all hide. The group finds themselves waking up in a room with clean cloths.It turns out they have been taken in by some guy and his Korean girlfriend who have survived for 90 years after the fall of man. They are still incredibly young, being mutants of some freak experiment and all. Little does our group of rebel cavemen know they are pawns in a scheme to turn them all into mutant kind...This film is God-awful. The lead actor swithces personalaties 8 or 9 times, literally. In every scene he has a different accent and a completley different mood. 30 minutes of this movie is a drugged out orgy, again, literally. My friend and I were watching this and about every 7 minutes we said ""I can't believe this is still going on.""There are loads of boobies in this film that would, if only the girls were hot, make it worth it. The hottest girl in the film dies first, of course. The final chick we get to see nude is a scrawny chicken like creature and more pale than Michael Jackson. The caveman on the cover is in the movie, howeve he is not one of the actual cavemen.I guarantee that if you are able to keep your eyes on this movie you will get lost in it. There is a story, a very weak one. But the scenes drag out in completely pointless fashions. The characters have lengthy exchanges that are completely meaningless.

This one concerns the primitive living conditions of the human survivors after civilization is destroyed by violent storms.  Despite the harsh conditions and the struggle to survive, the teenagers seem to have plenty of leisure time to plan rebellion and break the rules.  After one altercation a small band of teens heads out into the wilderness and discover the remains of a city.  Suddenly they find themselves guests of a strange pair of teens who seem to have all of the power and resources they need.The leader of the strange teens, sporting a silly-looking top-knot, seduces the group with music, food, technology and comfort.  Later, he and the female of the pair also seduce the group with sex.  It is after the orgy that the viewer starts to get an idea of what is going on and what secrets are being kept.  This is a horror movie, so people start dying for various reasons until the inevitable final struggle.  Then we have a new leader emerge who also decides to suddenly sport the silly-looking top-knot.  A final scene helps to tie up the loose ands and leaves the view wondering what will happen next to the characters.I have watched all of the Creature Feature films and this is the worst.  Really bad acting combines with a poorly written script and almost nonexistent special effects.  Plenty of nudity and sex are thrown in but it all just results in a silly mess.

The movie starts off slow and goes down hill from there.Tribes of humans live in a cave ruled by a religious nut who basically is a remake of that so-called leader in Waco. This leader gets his 'jollys' deflowering girls who catch his eye and makes up all sort of rules to follow as long as it doesnt interfer with his 'fun'.Having rejected someone who he thinks is a threat to his rule a band of kids decide to leave the area and set up camp somewhere else.A sandstorm comes fade to black. The kids wake up in a clean new and to them a strange place with plenty of clothes, food and drink as well as drugs. Meeting their 2 mutant rescuers (a guy and girl) the kids degrade into a massive orgy of drink and drugs.Now, who was the idiot who decided that EXTREME close ups of teenages having sex and doing drugs is a good idea? Instead of having the camera in everybody's faces and moving it around and jumping back and forth all the time. The director should have pulled back to a wide shot and let it go. Made me think of that remake of 13 ghosts. Heres a naked girl, cut to some guy's head, back to another girl, cut to moving camera behind everybody's head.Could have been better directed by someone with more experience then a collge grad fresh out of directer's school. The story and plot goes downhill faster then a car off a cliff. The kids after having sex with the mutants start to die or are killed by the male mutant in a fit of anger.Now background story about how they survived or became mutants (unless that was explained during the long winded, boring speeches given by both mutants at one time or another. The powers of the mutants are never fully explained just that the female and male both have heighted senses and the female can make anybody see what she wants them to see other then that I guess the ability to turn into a toxic warrior wanna be was just a bonus.Can anybody tell me if that scrawny, flat chested blond lives or dies at the end of the movie? Major plot hole there.Plot holes, bad acting, bad camera angles, bad story and bad directing aside.

701850,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,B000066S26,Richard Ross,"[4, 4]","Under the official banner of a B movie Larry Clark takes his obsession with teen sex to a whole new level. Teenage Caveman takes place sometime in the future after a devastating storm wipes out humanity. The storm was an act of  God who wanted to punish humans for giving into their sexual curiosity. The few survivors live in caves.  In one particular cave lives David (Andrew Keegan), his girlfriend Sarah (Tara Subkoff) and a few of their friends. David's father is the tribal leader who likes to have sex with his son's friends. He believes that he is doing God's will by raping the young members of his tribe but when he tries it with Sarah David kills him. David is sentenced to death but before his punishment is carried out his friends rescue him and the teens make a break for it. They travel for days  until they stumble upon an intact city that they later find out is run by solar energy. They  get caught up in a sandstorm and when they come to they have been taken in by a young couple named Neil (Richard Hillman) and Judith (Tiffany Limos). Neil and Judith introduce the kids to punk rock and teach them how to drink and do lines of coke. What they delight in showing their new house guests however are the pleasures of sex which they demonstrate by inviting the kids to join them for a  group bath. After the kids are cleaned up Judith leads them all in an orgy. For some of the kids they think they've  found paradise  with all the constant sex but David and Sarah are suspicious of their new leaders. They refrain from the sexual activities and David learns the truth about Neil and Judith. They are survivors of medical experiments that resulted in them becoming genetic mutants. It ain't all bad though since they can never die and have the power to self heal. The reason they are so eager to have sex with the kids is so that they can spread  their mutation. They want everyone to be like them and once they have infected this group they plan on infecting the cave where they came from. This is the bottom of the barrel for Clark and that is saying something. There is so much gratuitous nudity and sex that this film safely qualifies as soft core. I'm not complaining about that however when you have someone as sexy as Tiffany Limos running around naked constantly. What I am complaining about is that that is the only redeeming part of the film. There isn't a good story to be told here and you won't find one decent performance from anyone. If you just wanna see some barely legal teens getting it on then this one's for you. The opening scene sets the tone for this whole film when Clark,  playing one of the elders of the tribe,dies when one of the teens impales him with a spear because he was tired of being told what to do. This murder results in the Clark character gaining martyr status in the tribe. As the camera pans from his dead body it stops to catch a glimpse of a signpost which reads ""no skateboarding."" Even in an apocalyptic world Clark still finds a way for these kids to be violent , sex crazed outlaws.",2,Tons of gore and nudity.

Still, as long as you conform properly and don't wish for the ways of the old world, listening instead to the garbled mixture of religion and healthy obscenities mouthed by the community's priest, you'll be fine. The problem comes when the priest's son, already furious with his father and the way that he treats his little band of miscreant friends, finds his girlfriend's virtues impeded upon and he's forced to introduce a cross and his father's eye to one another. This unfortunately leads him to be sentenced to death, one that the acting gods should have forced down his throat, but his friend's, curse their black hearts, unfortunately saved him. So, exile ensues and they wander for a time until, on the horizon, the ruins of Seattle are found.After being buried in a storm that almost claimed their lives, the band of horrid actors find themselves in a lair that looks very much like a stage prop and some dressing rooms, confronted by two very odd, very energetic, souls. After being properly introduced to a variety of vices that include but are not limited to bodily fulfillment and a vast array of pharmaceutical delights, they find themselves slowly immersed in a most horrid existence, one that spins out of control as the theme progresses forward and Stan Winston is finally allowed to play.Sadly, I have to say that this movie was something that I found very, very disappointing. I had thought that it, because of its Creature Feature logo, would be something of merit, walking the line that the others (Earth vs. The Spider, She Creature, The Day the World Ended, and so on) had. Unfortunately, this thought was thrown out a tad too quickly and I'm still reeling from the brunt of the shock. While I did enjoy certain things about the movie, the actors finding themselves within the ruins of Seattle and the clothing-optional settings that they brought with them, not to mention the effects by Stan Winston, the caption on the front of the movie proclaiming that it isn't so great wasn't far from the truth.
