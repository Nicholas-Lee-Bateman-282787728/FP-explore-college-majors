886436,A2S244KFX0745K,B0007PAMII,Alan Edward Creager,"[0, 0]","""Zero Day"" is one of the most unusual and fascinating movies I have ever seen, a perfect example of effective use of limited resources. It also has an interesting history. Director Ben Coccio first thought of and began writing the film in the wake of Columbine in 1999, completed it in 2001, but didn't release it until 2003 because of the September 11 attacks. In the intervening two years he had plenty of time to edit, something Coccio did for about six months. The end result was another great film that upon release received virtually no attention but is well-appreciated by the few people who have seen it. ""Zero Day"" is a grand total of 92 minutes long, and had my attention for all 92 of them.The premise of ""Zero Day"" is simple: two American high schoolers somewhat like Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, planning a school shooting very much like Columbine. And like Harris and Klebold, our two- protagonists?- document their plans and preparation through a handheld video camera. We see the entire movie through that camera, save for the opening and closing credits and the scene, filmed by school security cameras, where the boys' planning comes to fruition. The filming of ""Zero Day"" is highly unique in that not one professional camera was used, and I believe that definitely adds a feeling of realism to it. Few would-be school shooters have the kind of cameras Hollywood does.""Zero Day"" has few surprises as far as the plot goes. Two disgruntled teenagers are documenting their plan to attack their high school, ending their own lives being part of the plan. What do you think happens? They decide to call it off? I won't spoil anything for you, but big plot twists are not why somebody goes to see ""Zero Day"". But that's not to say the plot isn't interesting. It's not so much learning where it ends- the destination is more or less understood- but the journey that takes us there. Andre Kriegman and Cal Gabriel take us along as they prepare for the big day, offering advice and expressing opinions and beliefs along the way.I was disappointed to find the film starts after they've already made the decision- the conversation(s), the evolving and shaping of Andre and Cal's views and goals, that led up to their making the solemn pact of ""Zero Day"" would have been interesting to see. Or, at least to have discussed in detail. But while it did retain my interest consistently from beginning to end, ""Zero Day"" rather let me down as far as the biggest question regarding school shooters goes- why they did it. It seems to shy away from that. Yes, it can be taken for granted that Andre and Cal already know. But what about us? We're watching the movie, after all. Coccio should have taken that part of the movie head-on- it's already controversial, so make the most of it.There is no soundtrack to speak of in ""Zero Day"". It has exactly two songs- Sonic Youth's ""Eliminator Jr."" and Benji Cossa's ""Volcano"". The latter is the movie's theme song if it has one- played during the closing credits, it is so fitting that Cossa could have written the song expressly for ""Zero Day"". Another song I would suggest listening to is The Beach boys' ""I Just Wasn't Made for these Times"", which Ben Coccio had wanted to use also, but for unknown reasons wasn't able to. That song, just like ""Volcano"", fits ""Zero Day"" like a glove. Ben Coccio used very few songs in his movie, but certainly knew how to pick them.Most of ""Zero Day"" is one member of the self-proclaimed ""Army of Two"" speaking to the other. There are some occasions where the camera is used for something totally irrelevant, such as Cal going to the dentist and Andre being visited at his job at a pizza place by his father. Some have said that Andre and Cal only interact meaningfully with each other, and that their plan overshadows everything else they do. Well, wouldn't that make sense? Why would their jobs, social lives, or future careers matter at all, when they're in the final stages of a plan that makes all those things irrelevant? Maybe Zero Day weighs on their minds, detaches Andre and Cal from all other aspects of their lives. That is a likely phenomenon, something Coccio captures very well. Not many high schoolers plan on killing themselves and as many classmates as possible before graduation, so the mindset and feelings that come with that are probably difficult for most to imagine.All that said, ""Zero Day"" works a lot more than it doesn't. It has made it to the point of being readily available on DVD despite virtually no theatrical release- I certainly never heard of one- and a two year delay in getting it released in the first place. Coccio dared to make a kind of movie very few people ever have- or will, deciding to deal with a much more realistic, much more relevant kind of evil than the one we are used to seeing. ""Star Wars"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" both show evil on a titanic scale ultimately getting the epic butt-kicking it deserves. ""Zero Day"" offers no such resolution, because that just isn't possible. Backyard evil isn't as popular in theaters for two reasons- it can't be resolved the same way as standard movie evil, and I very much doubt the public likes having to deal with it. And while that may be understandable, that isn't acceptable.""Zero Day"" is the kind of movie we need to have more of, one that deals with issues very relevant to real life. While it's nice to get lost in Fantasyland once in a while, we can't let ourselves stay there. It matters a lot more that we think about what ""Zero Day"" leaves us with than whether or not it's right to invade planets full of blue people. Yes, ""Avatar"", I'm talking about you.",5,Truly exceptional.,1303430400,"04 22, 2011",2011,5640,"['Day', 'one', 'most', 'unusual', 'fascinating', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'perfect',

886437,A2GANR9I6XHTU9,B0007PAMII,Amy Lynn,"[7, 8]","Excellent Independent Film about 2 boys ( Andre and Cal ) who over the course of a year are planning an assault on their school which they will call ( Zero Day). Zero day is the code word for the day on which the shooting will take place. Over the course of this year we are shown the whole plan and get to see into the minds of the killers.  These use video cameras to record their mission. Every aspect is planned to perfection. We get to see many sides of their personalities/ how normal or ordinary they are at one point, yet we cant understand why they commited these crimes. The one mentions some things that happened to him in school during the film but you are left wondering. Why? They claim there is no reason. Could be for notoriety or just hate for society in general.  The film looks like it was shot with a regular home video camcorder. It adds a hardcore realness to the film. You can easily mistake this for being real. It is, in a sense real. Its extremely well acted and compelling. Chilling and Artistic film. I try to find unique films on Amazon that I havent seen before and once in a great while I'll find one. It's rare to find a gem like this- Everyone should see this.

886440,A31A9GENAJYD64,B0007PAMII,David M. Rossi,"[4, 4]","Zero Day is yet another of the many films trying to make sense of the much publicized school shootings that seem to be increasing in frequency across the nation. What makes this movie different from many others lies in two different areas.One, There doesn't appear to be a single major issue that stands out as the precursor to such a horriffic and perfectly planned out event. Yes, we are given snippets here and there through the characters that their general hatred toward their classmates was indeed fueled by the usual bullying behaviors. Sure they go to school with kids in a better economic circumstance and probably rub it in their faces every chance they get, but these are only glimpses and suppositions. Overall, we are left to really wonder about whether these or the other factors of being a teen were what ultimately led these teens to their carefully laid plans.Two, The film is as raw and believable as a camcorder film of your own family. Gus Van Sant may have provided some interesting curveballs in Elephant by looking through the students' eyes as they moved through their schoolday, but Zero Day's take on the methodical countdown to disaster is nothing short of amazing. These teens don't seem to be acting at all. They are just teens being themselves. There's no hollywoodized impression of what it's like to be a teen, this is just raw, seemingly unscripted improvisation as the pair makes their plans of destruction.It all fuses together in a chaotic, realistic film that will leave you searching within yourself for ways to prevent further real life examples of this type of tragic occurrence. Never before have I been so deeply affected by a film's finale. It's a gut wrenchingly real scene that still makes tears well up in my eyes as I am writing this. As if the fruition of the pair's plans aren't bad enough, the final short scene before the credits is another that will leave you shaking your head. Zero day is beyond any star rating. This is not a movie, it's life.Watch Zero Day, and get involved with EVERY aspect of your child's life. Be there for them every step of the way. Find out if they are experiencing anything that is too much for them to handle. We all must do our part to make certain that our children not only have a loving environment at home, but a proper school experience as well. If the school officials are blind to what's going on in their schools, make them see. The difference between acting and standing on the sidelines and just hoping everything is ok could be a lot more deadly than you think.",5,astonishing work,1138406400,"01 28, 2006",2006,2555,"['Zero', 'Day', 'yet', 'many', 'films', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'much', 'publicized', 'school', 'shootings', 'seem', 'be', 'increasing', 'frequency', 'nation', 'What', 'movie', 'different', 'many', 'others', 'lies', 'two', 'different', 'areas.One', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'single', 'major', 'issue', 'out', 'precursor', 'horriffic', 'perfectly', 'planned', 'out', 'event', 'Yes', 'are', 'given', 'snippets', 'here', 'there', 'characters', 'general', 'hatred', 'classmates', 'was', 'indeed', 'fueled', 'usual', 'bullying', 'behaviors', 'Sure', 'go', 'school', 'kids', 'better', 'economic', 'circumstance', 'probably', 'rub', 'chance', 'get', 'are', 'only', 'glimpses', 'suppositions', 'Overall', 'are', 'left', 'really', 'wonder', 'other', 'factors', 'being', 'teen', 'were', 'what', 'ultimately', 'led', 'teens', 'carefully', 'laid', 'plans.Two', 'film', 'raw', 'believable', 'camcorder', 'film', 'own', 'family', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'may', 'have', 'provided', 'interesting', 'curveballs', 'Elephant', 'looking', 'students', 'eyes', 'moved', 'schoolday', 'Zero', 'Day', 'take', 'methodical', 'countdown', 'disaster', 'nothing', 'short', 'amazing', 'teens', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'acting', 'are', 'just', 'teens', 'being', 'hollywoodized', 'impression', 'what', 'be', 'teen', 'just', 'raw', 'seemingly', 'unscripted', 'improvisation', 'pair', 'plans', 'destruction.It', 'together', 'chaotic', 'realistic', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'searching', 'ways', 'prevent', 'further', 'real', 'life', 'examples', 'type', 'tragic', 'occurrence', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'deeply', 'affected', 'film', 'finale', 'gut', 'wrenchingly', 'real', 'scene', 'still', 'tears', 'well', 'up', 'eyes', 'am', 'writing', 'fruition', 'pair', 'plans', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'final', 'short', 'scene', 'credits', 'will', 'leave', 'shaking', 'head', 'Zero', 'day', 'star', 'rating', 'not', 'movie', 'life.Watch', 'Zero', 'Day', 'get', 'involved', 'EVERY', 'aspect', 'child', 'life', 'Be', 'there', 'step', 'way', 'Find', 'out', 'are', 'experiencing', 'anything', 'too', 'much', 'handle', 'must', 'do', 'part', 'make', 'certain', 'children', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'loving', 'environment', 'home', 'proper', 'school', 'experience', 'as', 'well', 'school', 'officials', 'are', 'what', 'going', 'schools', 'make', 'see', 'difference', 'acting', 'standing', 'sidelines', 'just', 'hoping', 'everything', 'ok', 'could', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'deadly', 'think']",Zero Day
886441,AAU7CAQIN5BAE,B0007PAMII,"EliteLamo ""too weird to live, too rare to die""","[2, 2]","In this harsh reality of our existence, and this foul year of our Father 2008, we find the increasing hysteria around violence, school shootings, and teenagers carrying guns, not so much in the ghetto's and big cities of America, but in suburbia. The aftermath of events like that of Columbine and Virginia Tech echo only true emotions to the reality that we revolve ourselves around in and in that we find, 'Zero Day'While the two main characters, Andre Kriegman and Calvin Gabriel, fitting like a glove to perhaps the days and months that prepared the real life Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, who themselves made home videos, are ever present in the film. The pure tenacity, and testicular fortitude the two have is beyond maniacal. The opening segment alone, of the two as youth's, with the stellar opening song, is enough to set you up for a roller coaster of a trip.Zero Day delivers in a way you would only expect it to. There is no need to expect a dynamite show of method acting and the like. We, as in other films of it's genre, see the life and times of two troubled teens, building an arsenal of weapons and coming from left field without a trace of worry from friend or family alike. However we are lead to believe, by the perps themselves, that they are not the end product of Grand Theft Auto Marathon's until the early next morning, or by-products of shows like 24 or the like. They take full responsibilty for their actions and make it clear in their videos, that no one is to blame, and no one could have prevented this. I think that is a very important mechanism in the film. As much as we want to protect our children, in the end, they will do what they want to do, right even under our nose.In the hey-dey of horrid first person, cam-shooting genres like 'Blair ' and the horrible-as-much-as-you-want-to-candycoat-it 'Cloverfield', the film is not shifty, jaded or nauseous in anyway. In fact the camcorder shooting is quite appealing and very personal, as it should be. If you really let yourself immerse into the movie, you feel as if you were with the two boys throughout the whole planning of the massacre. You have front row seats into their zero day plan, their march towards victory, their own personal vendetta towards the how the other half walks. Their own chiming in on the world to let everyone know, they too will be remembered.People might come here, and say the movie brings a strong message to all, that is should be a guide or an aid to what schools should be prepared for. Well in all reality, it should make the bullies, the jocks, 'Johnny Football Hero' who gets away with everything and anything because he is the town's pride and joy, and that stuffing Mike the Chess Player in the toilet after gym can have dire consequences. Not to say what happens in this movie or at Columbine was warranted, but you never hear about the torment these kind of kids go through, getting called names that could demoralize a youth for life.I wont give anything away, but if you want something better than the Van Sant pederastic feel to a film like the incessantly juvenile 'Elephant', and something less surreal then 'Bang, Bang, Your Dead,' perhaps Zero Day is a shining example that you dont have to go to NYU or USC film school to get into the hearts and minds of movie lovers who really appreciate art in the form of pure, raw, commando-style filmmaking.

886444,A1BPCSTNJDIL69,B0007PAMII,"Mono-Grind ""dtb""","[5, 5]","I've been wanting to write a review for this movie for a long time, and here i am. This movie, at least to me, is powerful. I understand some people might not either 'get it' (even though the movie is quite straight-forward really) or might not like it due to it's content and what it's basically about. There are many things about this movie that i really cannot fault at all..from the brilliant acting, the way the two central characters plan the 'attack' i guess you could say and basically slide further and further away from reality, to the powerful way the movie ends..this movie is one of my favorite movies now, and it's a crime that it's not more well-known.The story follows two teenage males, outcasts at their school who are taunted by Jocks and rejected by most of the peers. They start off with the idea of a school shooting, trying to keep it a secret but also giving out hints to their parents and the few friends/other family they have which makes it a little creepy. It's also creepy in the way the characters are pretty much happy with what they're planning, they're happy about the 'revenge' aspect they're hoping to indulge in on 'Zero Day'. Slowly, during the movie, you see their disintegration and how..together, especially..they seem to live in their own world. Together, they are the Army of Two.The whole movie and idea is based, if not entirely at least a little bit, on the Columbine Massacre in Colorado of April 1999. The movie is also filmed like The Blair Witch Project, but isn't copying it in any way. I think if The Blair Witch Project was never made, Zero Day would still film it in this way..because it shows the video diaries of the two central characters in this movie. Counting down the days to the eventual 'Zero Day'.The actors in this movie are not professional actors, which makes it even more amazing considering the acting is incredible i think. It makes it that much more real to use actual teenagers.  If you have seen Elephant, and enjoyed it, definitely check this awesome movie out. Personally, i think it is better in alot of ways than Elephant..but i also enjoyed Elephant very much. Zero Day is an extremely interesting experience for open-minded people who want to indulge in a serious film with a serious message.

We weren't effected by movies, TV, video games, books or what ever. it just had to be done."" The film paints a picture of these animals as though they are some sort of saviors sending a message that almost makes what they do seem acceptable. This kind of film could influence other young people who are not mentally sound to do the same thing. And on that level this film should be condemmed. Also because the film explains realistically how to make pipe bombs, how to utilize guns, and so fourth I think it's dangerous film in the hands of the mentally weak. This film should freighten people and be a genuine wakeup call to a very real and pressing danger that is all too true in todays worlkd. On the other hand the film does send an obvious message at the end that they are despised by their peers for what they did. And one only needs to look at this story objectively to understand that the two boys who were the central characters were the lowest and sickest form of life on earth. And I think the film does get that message across if your willing to note that point. Over all a very convincing film that should be taken as a serious warning.

First, the viewer should know that this movie is not a documentation of the Columbine shooting...it does however use that crime as it's basis. Second, the viewer should also realize that even though it's based on Columbine, it's premise is what is thought to be in the Columbine ""Basement Tapes"" and relies on written opinions of those tapes and speculation. These are videos recorded by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold documenting the planning of the crime and are currently in lock up with the Jefferson County Sheriff's office and have been seen by only a handful of people.We're introduced immediately to the protagonists and get a clear picture of what they're planning. The filming is entirely on hand held video (thus theoretically matching the Basement Tapes) which certainly adds realism to the film. They say that they are angry and plan to attack the school, but no evidence of bullying, mental health problems or egomaniacal behavior is presented and this I feel is the major drawback in this film. Granted, most of the major clues missed at Columbine were the result of Harris's and Klebold's apparent normal behavior but their anger ensued over time...time that obviously isn't available to the film's makers. The directors needed to establish a base anger in my opinion and then this film would have seemed a bit more believable.Again, clearly using the evidence of the Columbine shooting, we follow Andre and Cal's progress in development of the plan...numerous similarities are noted to the actual crime. On the day of the ""big ass mission"" we see a short scene explaining their actions and apologizing for the coming events.The actual attack is covered by school video surveillance tape and has been confused with actual Columbine footage on many video websites. This is the highlight of the film as it presents a somber picture of what it may have been like inside Columbine...the viewer gets a surreal experience and should be discreet regarding watching this with children. The film closes with anger at a makeshift memorial set up for the victims, similar to the memorial erected at Clement park's Rebel Hill following Columbine.This is a film not recommended for general view, but an essential one for understanding and experiencing what school shootings are like.",4,Where is the anger?,1263513600,"01 15, 2010",2010,2624,"['Having', 'spent', 'better', 'part', 'last', 'year', 'researching', 'studying', 'tragedy', 'Columbine', 'naturally', 'turned', 'movie', 'part', 'research', 'came', 'away', 'little', 'torn', 'certain', 'aspects', 'film', 'were', 'chillingly', 'realistic', 'added', 'depth', 'understanding', 'others', 'were', 'clearly', 'uninformed', 'rushed', 'First', 'viewer', 'should', 'know', 'movie', 'not', 'documentation', 'Columbine', 'shooting', 'however', 'use', 'crime', 'basis', 'Second', 'viewer', 'should', 'also', 'realize', 'even', 'based', 'Columbine', 'premise', 'what', 'thought', 'be', 'Columbine', 'Basement', 'Tapes', 'relies', 'written', 'opinions', 'tapes', 'speculation', 'are', 'videos', 'recorded', 'Eric', 'Harris', 'Dylan', 'Klebold', 'documenting', 'planning', 'crime', 'are', 'currently', 'lock', 'up', 'Jefferson', 'County', 'Sheriff', 'office', 'have', 'been', 'seen', 'only', 'handful', 'people.We', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'immediately', 'protagonists', 'get', 'clear', 'picture', 'what', ""'re"", 'planning', 'filming', 'entirely', 'hand', 'held', 'video', 'thus', 'theoretically', 'matching', 'Basement', 'Tapes', 'certainly', 'realism', 'film', 'say', 'are', 'angry', 'plan', 'attack', 'school', 'evidence', 'bullying', 'mental', 'health', 'problems', 'egomaniacal', 'behavior', 'presented', 'feel', 'major', 'drawback', 'film', 'Granted', 'most', 'major', 'clues', 'missed', 'Columbine', 'were', 'result', 'Harris', 'Klebold', 'apparent', 'normal', 'behavior', 'anger', 'ensued', 'time', 'time', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'available', 'film', 'makers', 'directors', 'needed', 'establish', 'base', 'anger', 'opinion', 'then', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'seemed', 'bit', 'more', 'believable.Again', 'clearly', 'using', 'evidence', 'Columbine', 'shooting', 'follow', 'Andre', 'Cal', 'progress', 'development', 'plan', 'numerous', 'similarities', 'are', 'noted', 'actual', 'crime', 'day', 'big', 'ass', 'mission', 'see', 'short', 'scene', 'explaining', 'actions', 'apologizing', 'coming', 'events.The', 'actual', 'attack', 'covered', 'school', 'video', 'surveillance', 'tape', 'been', 'confused', 'actual', 'Columbine', 'footage', 'many', 'video', 'websites', 'highlight', 'film', 'somber', 'picture', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'inside', 'Columbine', 'viewer', 'surreal', 'experience', 'should', 'be', 'discreet', 'regarding', 'watching', 'children', 'film', 'anger', 'makeshift', 'memorial', 'set', 'up', 'victims', 'similar', 'memorial', 'erected', 'Clement', 'park', 'Rebel', 'Hill', 'following', 'Columbine.This', 'film', 'not', 'recommended', 'general', 'view', 'essential', 'one', 'understanding', 'experiencing', 'what', 'school', 'shootings', 'are']",Zero Day
