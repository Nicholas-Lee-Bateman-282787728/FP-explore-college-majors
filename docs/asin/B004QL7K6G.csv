But sometimes, a long hike becomes, well, just a long hike, and it's better to just know when it's time to sit down and take a rest.  I knew that I was ready for one long before the film ended.This film surely was influenced by comedies made by Ben Stiller, where humiliation -- and being able to withstand that humiliation, even as the viewer -- is important.  These films can be really funny, but they can more easily devolve into cringefests.  Now, ""Wanderlust"" never quite gets that bad, but it sure acts as if it tries.Typical theme for this type of film:  are people who are involved in communes crazy, or is it more the case that people who engage in ""normal"" life really the crazy ones?  It deconstructs human behaviour to try to make that point, but it doesn't exactly work.  (It does have a lot of full male frontal nudity versus the standard female version in most ""dirty"" films, perhaps trying to help support that deconstruction.)  However, it still has it's moments, and I got a few good laughs out of it.But even still, I wanted to go 4 here, but I just couldn't.

However, it has 2 big names in it:  Jennifer Anniston and Paul Rudd, so I figured, how bad can it be?  Well, it wasn't bad at all.  It was FANTASTIC!In the movie (which is funny right from the start, by the way) Jennifer Anniston (Linda) and Paul Rudd (George) are a married urban couple living in a ""micro-loft"" in New York.  But when George loses his job and Linda's ultra-serious documentary about penguins is rejected by HBO, they decide to high-tail it out of NY and go live with George's wife and brother down south, until they figure out what they should do.It's a long drive to the brother's house, so George and Linda decide to stop along the way at a bed and breakfast called Elysium.  Only, SURPRISE!! This is no ordinary bed and breakfast.....it's really a modern day hippie commune!  (One clue that this is not your typical ""B & B"" is the totally naked guy they meet on the pathway to the hotel).Due to recent hardships in their lives, the experimental community - despite it's lack of privacy and philosophy of ""what's yours is mine"" - has appeal to George and Linda.  Soon they find themselves embracing the bohemian life style - well, Linda a bit more than George, since she suddenly has a crush on the very charismatic guru guy named Seth.Their marriage is challenged...temptations arise....and many quirky kooky characters are met (including Alan Alda, who is the patriarch of this weird hippie hotel).  Most importantly, there are plenty of laughs along the way....which never stop!  You know how some movies start out really funny, then they kind of ""lose it?""  Well, this movie retains the same high level of humor throughout.  I was never bored....I never felt like the movie ""dragged.""Bottom line?  I laughed.  Out loud!  Would this movie win any awards?  Probably not, but so what.  I was entertained.  I highly suggest this movie to anyone who just enjoys silly comedies about adults (not teenagers), such as Zoolander or 40 Year Old Virgin.  WARNING:  As you probably figured out by the cover (and the R rating) this movie is NOT for young children!

1424342,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B004QL7K6G,C. Sawin,"[34, 44]","After missing ""The State"" when it was on the air, I became a fan of David Wain when ""Stella"" hit Comedy Central in 2005. From there I went back and visited Wet Hot American Summer and Role Models. Wet Hot American Summer is a classic while Role Models is humorous but just slightly better than average overall. Expectations were honestly pretty low for Wanderlust. The trailers were mostly just toilet humor (literally) and what appeared to be your everyday modern couple going to live with a group of hippies. How good could that be? It's probably because expectations were so low that Wanderlust is as great as it turned out to be.George (Paul Rudd) and Linda (Jennifer Aniston) are moving to New York to follow their dreams. Well, George is reluctantly moving there while Linda follows her dreams. Now they find themselves with a studio apartment (oh excuse me, a ""micro-loft"") that is incredibly tiny and massively expensive. But things get rough when Linda's hopes get washed down the drain and George loses his job. George's brother Rick (Ken Marino) has a job waiting for George, but they're all the way in Atlanta. Leaving their dreams behind, George and Linda go on a road trip and stop at Elysium before reaching their destination. Elysium is unlike anything George and Linda have ever experienced before as everyone shares everything, is so open with one another, and even believes in free love. As everything that could go wrong does, George and Linda are faced with the decision of continuing to live in the city for the technology and advancements they love or moving to the country, being stripped of that technology, and feeling happier than they can ever remember.One could argue that Wanderlust uses the same formula over and over involving raunchy jokes and dialogue and featuring the most nudity of any film in your recent memory. That may be the case, but if you're familiar with David Wain's humor then this should come as no surprise. You probably know what you're getting yourself into and you're either a fan of his work or you hate it (but then why would you be seeing this anyway?). Wanderlust is labeled as a comedy and if it makes you laugh, then it's done its job. If anything, this is actually a return to form for both Wain and the majority of the cast of ""The State.""The film throws you headfirst into hilarity as the ""breaking the apartment in the old fashioned way"" scene is kind of a warm-up for what's to come. George's sarcasm is what will more than likely win you over the most while Linda's inability to commit to any sort of career causes her character to be pretty unpredictable. Elysium is a gold mine of eccentric characters; the most noteworthy being Wayne (Joe Lo Truglio) the nudist and Seth (Justin Theroux). Wayne's nude habits will either have you in tears from laughing so hard or cause you to turn away in disgust while Seth's outdated technology references, his ability to loiter around doorways out of sight and selfish tendencies are hilarious in their own right. Paul Rudd's mirror scene is what you'll remember the most though as you'll be laughing for a good two or three minutes straight from that scene alone.Wanderlust does get pretty outlandish in its second half, but it isn't exactly the most grounded concept to begin with. There are several dream-like sequences that are fantastically surreal. The two that come to mind are Linda's peyote-like trip during the trust circle and George's fly dream. The fly dream is actually one of my favorite scenes in the movie since it's just so bizarre and random yet manages to fit the flow of the movie somehow.The R-rated comedy does have its shortcomings though. Rick is easily the most annoying character to be featured in any film so far in 2012. You'll breathe a sigh of relief once his story arc is resolved. The other main one is the film's conclusion. It feels a bit generic when all of the raunchiness is dropped for heartfelt speeches and the struggle to do what's right. Everything still comes together in a logical sense, but it's in a way that seems so familiar which is kind of a letdown. The transition just doesn't feel as smooth as it should.Wanderlust is vulgar, obscene, littered with jiggling unclothed man and lady parts, and downright disgusting at times, but it's laugh out loud funny because of all of these things. The story may be a bit lacking in parts, but your laughter will drown out whatever flaws the movie may have. While Wanderlust may not be for everyone, it certainly soars and caters to those who love this type of comedy.",4,"Raunchy, vulgar, disgusting, and downright hilarious",1330041600,"02 24, 2012",2012,4563,"['missing', 'State', 'when', 'was', 'air', 'became', 'fan', 'David', 'Wain', 'when', 'Stella', 'hit', 'Comedy', 'Central', '2005', 'went', 'back', 'visited', 'Wet', 'Hot', 'American', 'Summer', 'Role', 'Models', 'Wet', 'Hot', 'American', 'Summer', 'classic', 'Role', 'Models', 'humorous', 'just', 'slightly', 'better', 'average', 'overall', 'Expectations', 'were', 'honestly', 'pretty', 'low', 'Wanderlust', 'trailers', 'were', 'mostly', 'just', 'toilet', 'humor', 'literally', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'everyday', 'modern', 'couple', 'going', 'live', 'group', 'hippies', 'How', 'good', 'could', 'be', 'probably', 'expectations', 'were', 'so', 'low', 'Wanderlust', 'as', 'great', 'turned', 'out', 'be.George', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Linda', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'are', 'moving', 'New', 'York', 'follow', 'dreams', 'Well', 'George', 'reluctantly', 'moving', 'there', 'Linda', 'dreams', 'Now', 'find', 'studio', 'apartment', 'oh', 'micro-loft', 'incredibly', 'tiny', 'massively', 'expensive', 'things', 'get', 'rough', 'when', 'Linda', 'hopes', 'get', 'washed', 'down', 'drain', 'George', 'job', 'George', 'brother', 'Rick', 'Ken', 'Marino', 'job', 'waiting', 'George', ""'re"", 'way', 'Atlanta', 'Leaving', 'dreams', 'George', 'Linda', 'go', 'road', 'trip', 'stop', 'Elysium', 'reaching', 'destination', 'Elysium', 'anything', 'George', 'Linda', 'have', 'ever', 'experienced', 'everyone', 'shares', 'everything', 'so', 'open', 'one', 'even', 'free', 'love', 'everything', 'could', 'go', 'wrong', 'George', 'Linda', 'are', 'faced', 'decision', 'continuing', 'live', 'city', 'technology', 'advancements', 'love', 'moving', 'country', 'being', 'stripped', 'technology', 'feeling', 'happier', 'can', 'ever', 'remember.One', 'could', 'argue', 'Wanderlust', 'same', 'formula', 'involving', 'raunchy', 'jokes', 'dialogue', 'featuring', 'most', 'nudity', 'film', 'recent', 'memory', 'may', 'be', 'case', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'David', 'Wain', 'humor', 'then', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'probably', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', ""'re"", 'fan', 'work', 'hate', 'then', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'seeing', 'anyway', 'Wanderlust', 'labeled', 'comedy', 'then', 'done', 'job', 'anything', 'actually', 'return', 'form', 'Wain', 'majority', 'cast', 'State', 'film', 'headfirst', 'hilarity', 'breaking', 'apartment', 'old', 'fashioned', 'way', 'scene', 'kind', 'warm-up', 'what', 'come', 'George', 'sarcasm', 'what', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'win', 'most', 'Linda', 'inability', 'commit', 'sort', 'career', 'character', 'be', 'pretty', 'unpredictable', 'Elysium', 'gold', 'mine', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'most', 'noteworthy', 'being', 'Wayne', 'Joe', 'Lo', 'Truglio', 'nudist', 'Seth', 'Justin', 'Theroux', 'Wayne', 'nude', 'habits', 'will', 'either', 'have', 'tears', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'cause', 'turn', 'away', 'disgust', 'Seth', 'outdated', 'technology', 'references', 'ability', 'loiter', 'around', 'sight', 'selfish', 'tendencies', 'are', 'hilarious', 'own', 'right', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'mirror', 'scene', 'what', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'most', ""'ll"", 'be', 'laughing', 'good', 'two', 'three', 'minutes', 'straight', 'scene', 'alone.Wanderlust', 'get', 'pretty', 'outlandish', 'second', 'half', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'most', 'grounded', 'concept', 'begin', 'are', 'several', 'dream-like', 'sequences', 'are', 'fantastically', 'surreal', 'two', 'come', 'mind', 'are', 'Linda', 'peyote-like', 'trip', 'trust', 'circle', 'George', 'fly', 'dream', 'fly', 'dream', 'actually', 'one', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'movie', 'just', 'so', 'bizarre', 'random', 'yet', 'fit', 'flow', 'movie', 'somehow.The', 'R-rated', 'comedy', 'have', 'shortcomings', 'Rick', 'easily', 'most', 'annoying', 'character', 'be', 'featured', 'film', 'so', 'far', '2012', ""'ll"", 'breathe', 'sigh', 'relief', 'story', 'arc', 'resolved', 'other', 'main', 'one', 'film', 'conclusion', 'bit', 'generic', 'when', 'raunchiness', 'dropped', 'heartfelt', 'speeches', 'struggle', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'Everything', 'still', 'together', 'logical', 'sense', 'way', 'so', 'familiar', 'kind', 'letdown', 'transition', 'just', ""n't"", 'feel', 'as', 'smooth', 'vulgar', 'obscene', 'littered', 'jiggling', 'unclothed', 'man', 'lady', 'parts', 'downright', 'disgusting', 'times', 'laugh', 'loud', 'funny', 'things', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'lacking', 'parts', 'laughter', 'will', 'drown', 'out', 'flaws', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'Wanderlust', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'certainly', 'caters', 'who', 'love', 'type', 'comedy']",Wanderlust

1424353,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B004QL7K6G,Douglas King,"[5, 7]","""Wanderlust"" functions less as a film than it does as a series of comedy sketches stitched together. Starring two attractive and funny leads (Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston) and featuring even more likable and funny actors in supporting roles (Justin Theroux, Lauren Ambrose, Malin Akerman, Alan Alda, etc.); there is no shortage of talent here to mine. What's lacking is a consistent, cohesive storyline and believable character development.Comedy Sketch 1: The film starts with couple George (Rudd) and Linda (Aniston) in New York, where their lives are falling apart. They've just spent a fortune on a tiny, overpriced studio apartment (or ""microloft"" as the real estate agent insists on calling it) when George loses his job, while Linda is unable to pitch her documentary (a labor of love about penguin testicular cancer) to HBO. This section of the film plays like a perfunctory parody of New York life, where hurried, exhausted people work in demanding, soul-crushing jobs just to be able to afford tiny apartments. This is territory that has been explored many, many times in much more clever films.Comedy Sketch 2: Desperate, George and Linda pack up and move to Atlanta, where George can work for his brother. Driving through northern Georgia and looking for a place to spend the night, the couple happens upon the ""Elysium"" community, a hippie commune full of all sorts of wacky, countercultural characters. George and Linda have a blast spending the night partying with the welcoming and free-spirited people, before continuing onto Atlanta.Comedy Sketch 3: George and Linda arrive at George's obnoxious, tactless brother's garish McMansion, in order to work for his Port-a-Potty business. The whole place reeks of misery, with George a rage-aholic, his wife heavily medicated, and his son an awful brat. So George and Linda quickly decide to go back to Comedy Sketch 2, to try living full time in Elysium.The film might have worked if it had just completely abandoned any conventional storytelling and just embraced being completely absurd (like ""Wet Hot American Summer"", the classic that director David Wain wrote). Unfortunately, ""Wanderlust"" tries to convince the audience that its main characters have somehow learned something throughout all their wacky adventures, and emerged a stronger couple, and its in this way that the film falls flat.

The audience only sees a blurred-view.  More female nudity would have made the movie more entertaining.  Especially that scene.Some of the humor is contrived.  The writers seem to think going on-and-on with a joke makes it funnier, but it doesn't.  When the Paul Rudd character has a chance to sleep with a good-looking woman with the permission of his wife (wife played by Jennifer Aniston) he is so nervous that he keeps saying strange things until the woman changes her mind.  It's unclear why the Paul Rudd character, who is level-headed most of the time, and has experience sleeping with a good-looking woman (his wife), would get so nervous that he says strange things.There is another joke which goes on-and-on in which male TV new-reporters harrass a female reporter while on-the-air.  This also gets less funny and less believable as it proceeds.The hippie characters are repeatedly referred to as vegan, but the Jennifer Aniston character is taught by them to milk a goat at the start of the movie.  Vegans don't drink milk.  This discrepancy isn't explained.  Nor are we told much about the food eaten at the commune.  A message of the movie is eat meat instead of unspecified vegan food.Near the end of the movie, one of the hippies physically assaults the Paul Rudd character, and the other hippies just stand by.  A hippie woman says that they believe in non-violence and so can't interfere.  As if they couldn't grab the assailant.

But the last half of the movie just dragged with a predictable and repetitive storyline. Another example of writers not having enough creative range to fill out and then finish their script.Movies about a return to hippie, commune, peace & love living emerge from either LA or NY writers about every five years so we were due for this rendition. This one had mostly an east coast vibe largely because of the quirky ""dumb blonde"" hook filled as usual by Aniston although, admittedly, she performed the role quite well. Now that I think about it, I'm not sure if that's a compliment or not. Subplot and foil to the quirky blonde was the usual income & status driven male love interest as counterpoint to her now stereotypic quirk portrayals. The hIppies, of course, win the day against the evil developers & bankers, in showing that veggies rule over bank accounts and portfolios. Well, until push comes to shove.Restricted Rating Warning:It's surprising how rarely full nudity is found in film given it's inherently curious we are about the subject.

Ultimately, however, I was a little disappointed.As often happens in life, a couple - George (Paul Rudd) and Linda (Jennifer Aniston) - makes a mutual sacrifice by following the dreams of one and risking the lives of both.  George and Linda get in over their heads when her documentary pitch gets rejected and he gets fired, leaving them with no money to afford the recently purchased expensive, downtown NYC studio apartment.  Left with no choices, they pack up and move to Atlanta where George's brother Rick (Ken Marino) has a menial backup job.  On the way they search for a place to stay they end up at the aforementioned Elysium (I was hoping they'd find the motel fromVacancy).  At Elysium they encounter an assortment of offbeat, outcast, and oddball who live their free-spirited way.  The experience at Elysium, and the soul-crushing life possibilities at Rick's house, is enough for George and Linda to question their current situation, their preoccupation with technology and industry, and contemplate a life-altering decision.  Sadly, Wayne (Joe Lo Trugilo) is quickly revealed as the only nudist of the group is, immediately tempering the excitement and anticipation of a possible Anniston or Malin Akerman uncovering.Speaking of Akerman, one of the strongest aspects of this movie is the combined cast.  Every bit player is someone who could carry a portion of a film in their own right.  Most are funny.  Alan Alda, Justin Theroux, Kathryn Hahn, Kerri Kenney, Lauren Ambrose, Michaela Watkins, and Todd Barry all bring something to the table.  Alan Alda, while up there in age, can still deliver in any role.Being a fan of raunchy comedy, I really thought I'd like the film more.  The script is predictable as can be, but it's easily dismissed for people who can shut off their brain for two hours.  I'm also a fan of Paul Rudd; his sarcastic delivery is hilarious.  Unfortunately this film didn't deliver nearly enough laughs, and disappointed me just like Couples Retreat.  One scene has Paul Rudd in front of a mirror, preparing for a tryst with Malin Akerman, and he's obviously adlibbing for an extended period of time.  It's painfully unfunny to watch.Verdict?  Not crude enough to win me over in aSuperbadsort of way, and not heart-warming enough to convince me in aLittle Miss Sunshinekind of way, but good enough at each that I sort of enjoyed it.",3,Wander.

There is an entertaining travel montage: they sing, argue, sleep, and take turns driving. They stay for one pleasant night at ""Elysium,"" a Utopian camp along the way, but continue on to the home of the successful brother and his semi-catatonic wife. It doesn't take long for us to understand why she is in that condition; he is hateful, short-tempered, rude and selfish. Our horrified couple flees back to the Utopian camp.Just let me caution you: This is a Judd Apatow-produced movie, so some of you shouldn't read any further because there will be raunch, nudity, profanity, nudity, fart jokes, nudity, diarrhea jokes, and a whole herd of elderly nudists running down a hill toward the camera. Get the DVD from Amazon.com so you can fast forward!If you're gonna go there, these are the folks you'll meet:* Paul Rudd (""Our Idiot Brother"") is the hapless New Yorker who is commanded to experience free love with a beautiful blonde. You won't expect his reaction.* Jennifer Aniston (""Horrible Bosses"") is the distaff side of the unemployed couple. She isn't too bad in this one.* Justin Theroux (""Your Highness"") is the spokesman and guru for the commune. He gets dibs on our heroine right away!* Alan Alda (""Tower Heist"") is one of the founding members of the commune. If only he could remember where he put that deed!* Ken Marino (lots of TV) is that vile brother. Marino is also one of the scriptwriters.* Joe Lo Truglio (""Paul"") is the first person they meet at the commune. We see a LOT of Joe! (Remember I mentioned nudity?)By the time we have explored ""free love"" and all the eccentricities and hypocrisies of the various occupants, I found myself becoming more and more impatient, so I was happy when our hero finally pops his cork and tells them off. He speaks for all of us and we agree with him wholeheartedly.Paul Rudd is a handsome, capable actor who has found himself in a bit of a rut. He is evidently a great improviser and I suspect his scene talking dirty to himself in the mirror was improvised. I'm sure the crew was cracking up (I wasn't!); the screening audience of young adults loved it.At least Jennifer Aniston was able to cast her boyfriend (Justin Theroux) in this one...sigh...

1424385,A3KDVSFMPMXSRO,B004QL7K6G,Kevin F. Tasker,"[6, 8]","While it does not reach the apex of bizarro comedic genius attained by David Wain's cult classic Wet Hot American Summer, Wanderlust, penned by Wain and Ken Marino (Party Down), inspires enough laughs to allow its tepid plot to be overlooked, due in large part to the committed performances of its leads--notably Rudd, whose sexual-pump-up speech is one for the ages, proving that simple anatomy can be ridiculously funny when flowing from the right mouth. Other actors, like Marino, seem annoyingly misplaced and more than a few gags are clumsy, but ultimately this shaggy dog of a film rears its head in profane, gleeful confusion enough times to endear itself to you. Devotees of the cerebral and short-lived Stella will rejoice.The wavering plot concerns George (Rudd) and Linda (Aniston), two New York up-and-comers whose lives are derailed by virtually spontaneous unemployment. The two have recently purchased a miniature apartment referred to as both a ""studio"" and ""micro-loft,"" depending on the whims of their avaricious and unhinged realtor. The apartment is the sort of place where the bed drops down from the wall and the addition of both a couch and an armchair would result in over-crowding. The New York scenes resound with satirical validity and are over perhaps too soon, resulting in a quasi-road picture vs. hippie-commune subplot that gradually grows to assimilate all other story threads. Pacing is Wanderlust's general flaw, with several scenes running too long--particularly those at Ken Marino's suburban hell castle which could have been handled during less intrusive (and plot-stalling) telephone conversations since watching grown men prance about smashing plates to express their ennui and women drinking into oblivion have been beaten to death and beyond in lesser movies.Wanderlust flounders when the action is confined to the hippie commune. Many subplots jump in and out including one in which a thoroughly gaunt and wheelchair bound Alan Alda attempts to remember where he kept the deed to the commune, as vague land developers appear to have their eye on repossessing it. The best scenes are the ones which seem hijacked by David Wain and rise above cliche set-ups. Most of these include a hardly recognizable Justin Theroux whose attempts to free George's mind during an arm-swinging yoga session results in fabulous wordplay from Rudd. Funnier than Aniston up in a tree on DMT, which could have been handled better (though the hallucinations were amusing). Elsewhere, the film is enlivened by character actors like Joe Lo Truglio (he was the ""you guys on myspace?"" freak from Superbad and the guy with the weird voice from I Love You, Man) whose novelist character Wayne spends much more time running amok with his manhood exposed than he does writing his novel about ""The Monster of the Beltway"". Ultimately, Wanderlust flows in a typically deranged Wain manner with cars showing up in odd places, babies delivered at inopportune moments (and with gory results) and polygamy taking hold of the central plot.

1424397,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B004QL7K6G,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[2, 4]","It sounds like a recipe for greatness. Take Judd Apatow, the creative genius behindThe 40-Year-Old VirginandSuperbadand add him to David Wain, the writer-director ofRole Modelsand one of the driving forces behind the now-defunct comedy troupeThe State. Throw in more than a few seasoned comedic actors (Paul Rudd, Alan Alda, Justin Theroux, and many of the same actors and actresses from the aforementioned comedy group) and the star power of Jennifer Aniston. You'd expect the end result to be an above-average comedy, if not downright hilarious.Don't get me wrong. Wanderlust isn't a bad film, but it doesn't really try very hard to be great. This might have something to do with the story, which is built so firmly on a tired cliche that none of the surrounding jokes can rise too high above it. The plot concerns George and Linda, two New Yorkers that have found themselves on the verge of bankruptcy and failure. In an attempt to avoid total destitution, the couple moves to Georgia to stay with George's horribly obnoxious brother, Rick (played by the writer of the movie, Ken Marino). Along the way, they detour to a very special bed-and-breakfast that turns out to be a hippie commune called Elysium. Cue: nudity, drugs, free love, and the loss of privacy and personal property.There are few directions to take this plot in that haven't been done before, and Wanderlust gives each of them a bit of play. Some people in the commune turn out to be not as wholesomely granola as they appear. George and Linda's addiction to work and money doesn't turn out to be so vile and absurd. Drugs and free love may or may not offer quite the utopia that they seem to. And, of course, real estate developers are all underhanded slime bags who only care about building casinos. In Georgia.Ha ha ha ha! Oh, silly movie. Commercial gambling isn't legal in Georgia! (You can hop on a casino boat in Savannah, but gambling isn't allowed until you're in international waters.) Ah, but who cares?I do. This is evidence of laziness. The evil real-estate developers did not have to be building a casino. It could have easily been any other symbol of American soullessness, such as a strip mall, or series of resorts, or something else not nearly so cliched and overused. The point being, instead of trying to be creative or clever, Marino went with the first immediately available stereotype and shoved it into the script, regardless of if it made sense or not. The same goes for most of the jokes about hippies and even suburban life (Rick's mortally depressed housewife is over-medicated and in hilarious (?) denial; hippies hilariously (?) try to have conversations with George while he's sitting on the toilet; the commune leader is so fried from years of LSD that he is an hilarious (?) chore to talk to). As the comedian once said, ""That joke's so old it can vote.""That's not to say it isn't done well. The actors nail nearly every scene, even if the lines seem pre-chewed. And there are a handful of refreshingly new additions to the line up, including a bit about a car in a lake, a nudist novelist, and a real estate agent who is unusually forthright about her personal life. But these are exceptions rather than the rule. The script is further muddied by Linda and George's constant flip-flopping on the whole hippie idea. Obviously, for the plot to work, one of them must love it and the other hate it, but those roles reverse mid-way through the movie, and for no immediately obvious reason other than that it must. The end result is that you can't tell who's being a stick-in-the-mud nor who is being blind to the less endurable realities of the whole hippie mindset. The movie doesn't really know how it feels about either side of the coin, and so it adopts a noncommittal attitude that makes the whole story feel ambivalent and overly-fake. It becomes less about a story, and more about an excuse to continue making jokes about finding the worst kind of hair in your homemade wine or people bringing placentas to breakfast.I laughed a decent amount, but I was bummed by the shrink-wrapped, assembly-line feel to the movie. With this much comedic talent working on a project, you'd expect, if nothing else, a little ingenuity (which is only briefly found in a few quick news segments) or risk. Instead, you have two people risking their entire livelihood in a story that, itself, takes no risks at all.",3,Competently Cliched,1339372800,"06 11, 2012",2012,4402,"['recipe', 'greatness', 'Take', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'creative', 'genius', '40-Year-Old', 'VirginandSuperbadand', 'David', 'Wain', 'writer-director', 'ofRole', 'Modelsand', 'one', 'driving', 'forces', 'now-defunct', 'comedy', 'troupeThe', 'State', 'Throw', 'more', 'few', 'seasoned', 'comedic', 'actors', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'Justin', 'Theroux', 'many', 'same', 'actors', 'actresses', 'aforementioned', 'comedy', 'group', 'star', 'power', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', ""'d"", 'expect', 'end', 'result', 'be', 'above-average', 'comedy', 'not', 'downright', 'hilarious.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Wanderlust', ""n't"", 'bad', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'try', 'very', 'hard', 'be', 'great', 'might', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'story', 'built', 'so', 'firmly', 'tired', 'cliche', 'none', 'surrounding', 'jokes', 'can', 'rise', 'too', 'high', 'plot', 'concerns', 'George', 'Linda', 'two', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'have', 'found', 'verge', 'bankruptcy', 'failure', 'attempt', 'avoid', 'total', 'destitution', 'couple', 'Georgia', 'stay', 'George', 'horribly', 'obnoxious', 'brother', 'Rick', 'played', 'writer', 'movie', 'Ken', 'Marino', 'way', 'detour', 'very', 'special', 'bed-and-breakfast', 'out', 'be', 'hippie', 'commune', 'called', 'Elysium', 'Cue', 'nudity', 'drugs', 'free', 'love', 'loss', 'privacy', 'personal', 'property.There', 'are', 'few', 'directions', 'take', 'plot', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'Wanderlust', 'bit', 'play', 'people', 'commune', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'not', 'wholesomely', 'granola', 'appear', 'George', 'Linda', 'addiction', 'work', 'money', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'so', 'vile', 'absurd', 'Drugs', 'free', 'love', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'offer', 'quite', 'utopia', 'seem', 'course', 'real', 'estate', 'developers', 'are', 'underhanded', 'slime', 'bags', 'who', 'only', 'care', 'building', 'casinos', 'Georgia.Ha', 'ha', 'ha', 'ha', 'Oh', 'silly', 'movie', 'Commercial', 'gambling', ""n't"", 'legal', 'Georgia', 'can', 'hop', 'casino', 'boat', 'Savannah', 'gambling', ""n't"", 'allowed', ""'re"", 'international', 'waters', 'Ah', 'who', 'do', 'evidence', 'laziness', 'evil', 'real-estate', 'developers', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'building', 'casino', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'other', 'symbol', 'American', 'soullessness', 'such', 'strip', 'mall', 'series', 'resorts', 'something', 'else', 'not', 'nearly', 'so', 'cliched', 'overused', 'point', 'being', 'instead', 'trying', 'be', 'creative', 'clever', 'Marino', 'went', 'first', 'immediately', 'available', 'stereotype', 'shoved', 'script', 'regardless', 'made', 'sense', 'not', 'same', 'most', 'jokes', 'hippies', 'even', 'suburban', 'life', 'Rick', 'mortally', 'depressed', 'housewife', 'over-medicated', 'hilarious', 'denial', 'hippies', 'hilariously', 'try', 'have', 'conversations', 'George', 'sitting', 'toilet', 'commune', 'leader', 'so', 'fried', 'years', 'LSD', 'hilarious', 'chore', 'talk', 'comedian', 'once', 'said', 'joke', 'so', 'old', 'can', 'vote', 'not', 'say', ""n't"", 'done', 'well', 'actors', 'nail', 'nearly', 'scene', 'even', 'lines', 'seem', 'pre-chewed', 'are', 'handful', 'refreshingly', 'new', 'additions', 'line', 'up', 'including', 'bit', 'car', 'lake', 'nudist', 'novelist', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'who', 'unusually', 'forthright', 'personal', 'life', 'are', 'exceptions', 'rather', 'rule', 'script', 'further', 'muddied', 'Linda', 'George', 'constant', 'flip-flopping', 'whole', 'hippie', 'idea', 'Obviously', 'plot', 'work', 'one', 'must', 'love', 'other', 'hate', 'roles', 'reverse', 'mid-way', 'movie', 'immediately', 'obvious', 'reason', 'other', 'must', 'end', 'result', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'who', 'being', 'stick-in-the-mud', 'who', 'being', 'blind', 'less', 'endurable', 'realities', 'whole', 'hippie', 'mindset', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'how', 'side', 'coin', 'so', 'noncommittal', 'attitude', 'whole', 'story', 'feel', 'ambivalent', 'overly-fake', 'less', 'story', 'more', 'excuse', 'continue', 'making', 'jokes', 'finding', 'worst', 'kind', 'hair', 'homemade', 'wine', 'people', 'bringing', 'placentas', 'breakfast.I', 'laughed', 'decent', 'amount', 'was', 'bummed', 'shrink-wrapped', 'assembly-line', 'feel', 'movie', 'much', 'comedic', 'talent', 'working', 'project', ""'d"", 'expect', 'nothing', 'else', 'little', 'ingenuity', 'only', 'briefly', 'found', 'few', 'quick', 'news', 'segments', 'risk', 'Instead', 'have', 'two', 'people', 'risking', 'entire', 'livelihood', 'story', 'risks']",Wanderlust

Could delayed cord severing or waiting for the cord to fall off on its on time (2 - 5 days) help the child to feel more connected/grounded in life?  Navel-gazing on the navel.  I think this movie deserves credit for giving viewers a rare look at how natural child birthing is done where the cord is allowed to drop off on its own accord (""A Lotus Birth"").

He really nailed certain specifics that made me both laugh AND feel that he was talking directly to me with this film.Sure, there are parts of the script and film that miss here or there, and -- as per usual with Wain productions -- some of the actors go a little overboard at times ... but, ultimately, it's a hilarious film that stays fresh and funny throughout, with some true emotion and moments of sincerity that I think are missing from most mainstream films today, especially those claiming to be comedies for the lumpen set.As such, it was equally refreshing that in an era where most such films -- funnily enough, usually stamped with the Apatow seal as this one is -- are about irritatingly annoying jerks who hate each other and who make you hate them even more (with the result of American Idol-watching, McDonald's eating troglodytes seem to not be able to get enough of such pablum), Wanderlust has characters who are actually endearing and who you want to see succeed; you're with them because they're ultimately good people and not just because they're played by du jour stars who you want to win despite how awful and superficial their characters may seem.Give it a shot; you'll definitely be able to tell within a few minutes whether this movie is for you or not.",4,"Wain/State/Stella fans, rejoice!",1388880000,"01 5, 2014",2014,1995,"['absolutely', 'adored', 'Wanderlust', 'same', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'State', 'Stella', 'Wet', 'Hot', 'American', 'Summer.The', 'humor', 'inherent', 'Wainiac', 'projects', 'one', 'moments', 'realities', 'opposed', 'sordid', 'jokes', 'how', 'uncomfortable', 'filmmakers', 'can', 'make', 'audience', 'feel', 'irritating', 'scatology', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'here', 'too', '.What', 'enjoyed', 'best', 'Wanderlust', 'however', 'was', 'nature', 'relationship', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'first', 'third', 'film', 'had', 'really', 'reflecting', 'back', 'last', 'relationship', 'loved', 'Wain', 'brought', 'so', 'many', 'realistic', 'qualities', 'living', 'modern', 'world', 'particularly', 'sense', 'harried', 'NYC', 'versus', 'hippie-dippie', 'Elysium', 'really', 'nailed', 'certain', 'specifics', 'made', 'laugh', 'feel', 'was', 'talking', 'directly', 'film.Sure', 'are', 'parts', 'script', 'film', 'miss', 'here', 'there', 'usual', 'Wain', 'productions', 'actors', 'go', 'little', 'overboard', 'times', 'ultimately', 'hilarious', 'film', 'fresh', 'funny', 'true', 'emotion', 'moments', 'sincerity', 'think', 'are', 'missing', 'most', 'mainstream', 'films', 'today', 'especially', 'claiming', 'be', 'comedies', 'lumpen', 'set.As', 'such', 'was', 'equally', 'refreshing', 'era', 'where', 'most', 'such', 'films', 'funnily', 'enough', 'usually', 'stamped', 'Apatow', 'seal', 'one', 'are', 'irritatingly', 'annoying', 'jerks', 'who', 'hate', 'other', 'who', 'make', 'hate', 'even', 'more', 'result', 'American', 'Idol-watching', 'McDonald', 'eating', 'troglodytes', 'seem', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'enough', 'such', 'pablum', 'Wanderlust', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'actually', 'endearing', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'succeed', ""'re"", ""'re"", 'ultimately', 'good', 'people', 'not', 'just', ""'re"", 'played', 'du', 'jour', 'stars', 'who', 'want', 'win', 'how', 'awful', 'superficial', 'characters', 'may', 'seem.Give', 'shot', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'few', 'minutes', 'movie', 'not']",Wanderlust

I am a woman in my thirties who loves comedies, especially romantic comedies. And if you are someone who has kept up with recent movie trends in comedy, you know that nudity and vulgar humor is nothing new. If you have seen ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and ""American Reunion"" you have seen male nudity. Honestly, it's about time. We've been watching naked women for decades on television. It's about time some naked men were added to the mix.  Most of the reviews here have exaggerated the amount of nudity in this movie. Basically, just one guy is naked through the movie, with one scene at the end in which everyone is running and naked (and it's funny).I won't get into details about the movie itself, but if you like today's idea of what a comedy is or a romantic comedy, like ""My Best Friend's Girl,"" you will enjoy this movie. I laughed many times. Paul Rudd is his usual hilarious self (and even funnier) and you get to see another side of Jennifer Aniston that she has yet to display in prior films. I really enjoyed this movie. I just got done watching it and am going to watch it again. Although, I felt the need to write this review for all the other people out there like myself, who are open-minded, down to earth, enjoy a good laugh and don't take offense to nudity. It's not one of those cheesy movies you watch and want to stop watching 5 minutes in. It's interesting and entertaining from beginning to end. I truly can't understand all of the bad reviews, unless the world consists of a lot of snobby, pretentious people? If you are a red-blooded, meat-eating (or vegan) American, you will love this movie! I hope that my review has done the job of helping others like myself decide whether or not they would like to rent this. If you want to be entertained and laugh, rent this movie now. If you are looking for some philosophical movie with some intrinsic deeper meaning, rent something else.

1424405,AGTFW4TAC7W2H,B004QL7K6G,"M. McClellan ""marksakissfan""","[6, 17]","Wanderlust is a lazy comedy about a New York couple George (Paul Rudd) and Linda (Jennifer Aniston) who find themselves unemployed and unable to pay for their too small-too expensive studio apartment -excuse me- microloft that they have just purchased. So they decide to abandon it and head south to Atlanta for a job that George's unbearable older brother Rick has set up for him. Along the way, they make a side stop at a kind of hippie bed and breakfast called Elysium. The commune is populated with all the stereotypical characters you see in comedies that poke fun of hippie culture. George takes a shine to it at first with its feel good, let it all go philosophy. Linda hates it of course. But they must have money so they proceed to Rick's house where poor George is subjected to Rick's lectures and overbearing nature because Rick is the success and George isn't. So they decide to head back to the commune where the tables turn and Linda starts loving the place and George hates it.Why? Because Linda has taken a shine to Elysium's alpha male Seth (Justin Theroux) and the prospect of free love with him. George is put off despite the promise of sex himself with the very attractive Eva (Malin Akerman). In a cringe inducing moment, George actually has to psyche himself up for it by talking dirty to himself in the mirror and then torpedoes the whole thing when he can't stop talking dirty to Eva turning her off. Of course why would any one need extra encouragement when it's Malin Akerman? Oh well.Then there's some artificial drama concerning a big corporation wanting to take over the land Elysium is on. That leads to your typical plot twist about who's helping them (hint: one of Elysium's members) but it's all handled like an afterthought.The problem with this flick is for one; the filmmakers chose an all too easy target (hippies) and instead of coming up with creative jokes they try to get laughs by showing how disgusting it's all supposed to be. For instance, when a couple who had recently given birth to their first child decide not to cut the imbilical cord and let it fall away naturally, they show up to the dinner table with the child and the cord still attached. Other jokes involve vegans and drinking concoctions made with roots and berries. There is one clever joke where Linda and Elysium's co-founder Carvin (Alan Alda) sneak off to a diner to eat ""real"" food including a plate full of sausages, steak and other meats.And course there are jokes involving nudity which leads to some full frontal discomfort mainly because the streakers are elderly or out of shape.Anyone who saw the red band trailer on YouTube (including me) will realize there are scenes missing from the final film. And the Mr. Skin crowd hoping to see Aniston topless will be dissappointed. So you may get the sense that the movie is a lot tamer than it could've been.Too bad too because Rudd and Aniston have real chemistry as a couple and are trapped in a script with trite jokes and no imagination at all.Bummer dude.",1,Wander away.

1424406,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B004QL7K6G,M. Oleson,"[26, 31]","I was reading snippets from numerous critics about this movie after watching it and I was surprised to find several panning it because it wasn't funny.  I get the fact that some people could be offended by the language, ""sexy talk"" and plenty-o-nudity but not funny?  Then I remembered how much I hated ""Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie.""As I think back a few hours about this movie I would argue that it might be just another comedy if not for the brilliance and comedic genius of Paul Rudd.  Yes, Jennifer Aniston seems to get more beautiful as she gets older and yes, she has her moments (including one involving pixilated boobs) but this is Rudd's movie.  He plays George and is married to Linda (Aniston).  They live in New York City.  After several unsuccessful career moves, Linda makes a pitch to HBO to show a documentary she produced about testicular cancer in penguins.  Pretty funny concept right there.  She's turned down.George is a successful business executive in the financial sector.  As the CEO of his firm is perp-walked away in handcuffs for some form of SEC malfeasance, George loses his job.  All of this comes the day after they movie into their brand new micro-loft studio apartment.  In route to Atlanta in their aging Honda, where George's brother Rick (co-writer Ken Marino) has promised a job, they stumble upon a bed and breakfast where they hope to stay for the night.  Located in northern Georgia, it is actually a commune community where characters of all stripes are in residence.  In spite of their differences, George and Linda enjoy their stay but must move on to Atlanta.After a night or two in Rick and Marisa's (Michaela Watkins) suburban home, they've had enough (Rick is an A-hole and Marisa is always drunk or drugged) and head back to the commune.  While, the comedy is a bit uneven at times, Rudd manages to rescue every scene he's in.  In one of the funniest bits I've ever seen, George readies himself for a sexual liaison with Eva (Malin Akerman).  Even with his wife's blessing, George has second thoughts so tries to pump himself up in front of a mirror.  He goes through several minutes of clearly unscripted riffs about how he's going to perform.  Using one clich&eacute;d macho term after another, I couldn't stop laughing.  It continues when he gets to the bedroom and actually confronts Eva.  He promises what she is going to experience which goes on until she is no longer interested.  I imagine this scene took forever to shoot and how Akerman kept a straight face is amazing itself.This movie is not for the prudish.  It includes full frontal nudity, some of which you really don't want to see (aging nudists running!), crude banter (sexual and otherwise) and some disgusting remnants of childbirth.

Well, that is until George loses his job and Linda's documentary is passed up on by HBO. So now what's a hip, happening couple to do? Taken in by George's douchey brother, they struggle to find their place in the world. After a refreshing overnight stay at Elysium, the couple decides to make their home more permanently at the rural commune, only to find the free-spirited life isn't quite what it seems.You know those movies where the trailer looks absolutely hilarious but then when you watch it you realize that all the funny parts were already in the trailer and you've essentially wasted your time? Yeeeeah. This is one of those movies. Don't get me wrong--I'm not saying Wanderlust wasn't funny, because it certainly did have its moments, but those parts are very far and very few between. Overall, for the type of movie it was, it was conventional and generic. Again, this is one of those times where high expectations led to severe disappointment. Wain and Rudd's previous collaborations (Wet Hot American Summer and Role Models) were total winners. I mean, the concept--taking a modern, hip couple and throwing them into a hippie-style commune--is comedy gold. So then where did it all go wrong?Let's start with the casting. Aniston isn't someone you'd expect to see in a raunchy comedy and I suppose since her stint in Horrible Bosses, she's trying hard to break away from her rom-com typecasting. But I have to say, she just looked like a fish out of water. It just wasn't a role that suited her. Rudd, on the other hand, was right at home with his composed-man-meets-crazy-antics act. He practically invented and perfected the dry wit and sarcastic humour bit and he's about the movie's only saving grace because of it. I feel like everything else was just too forced or over the top to be funny. Wanderlust was a let-down and in no way lives up to Wain's previous credits. Yes, some of the characters are quirky but they grow to be too awkward and unbelievable for my liking. The plot was a mash-up of dull hippy clich&eacute;s and it got old very quickly. I honestly had a better time watching the trailer than I did the feature-length film, which is saying something.Food for Thought: Wanderlust is one of those movies that is doomed to lay in the ""failed-to-meet-expectations graveyard."" It's a conventional film that's raunchy for the sake of being raunchy and far from memorable, though it does generate a few laughs. I'd say, if you want to see it, it's worth a rental at best.Rating: &#9733;&#9733;",2,"In the ""failed to meet expectations"" graveyard!",1350950400,"10 23, 2012",2012,2702,"['Linda', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'George', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'have', 'great', 'jobs', 'wonderful', 'marriage', 'shiny', 'new', 'microloft', 'heart', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'toast', 'success', 'Well', 'George', 'job', 'Linda', 'documentary', 'passed', 'up', 'HBO', 'So', 'now', 'what', 'hip', 'happening', 'couple', 'do', 'Taken', 'George', 'douchey', 'brother', 'struggle', 'find', 'place', 'world', 'refreshing', 'overnight', 'stay', 'Elysium', 'couple', 'make', 'home', 'more', 'permanently', 'rural', 'commune', 'only', 'find', 'free-spirited', 'life', ""n't"", 'quite', 'what', 'seems.You', 'know', 'movies', 'where', 'trailer', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'then', 'when', 'watch', 'realize', 'funny', 'parts', 'were', 'already', 'trailer', ""'ve"", 'essentially', 'wasted', 'time', 'Yeeeeah', 'one', 'movies', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'Wanderlust', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'certainly', 'did', 'have', 'moments', 'parts', 'are', 'very', 'far', 'very', 'few', 'Overall', 'type', 'movie', 'was', 'was', 'conventional', 'generic', 'Again', 'one', 'times', 'where', 'high', 'expectations', 'led', 'severe', 'disappointment', 'Wain', 'Rudd', 'previous', 'collaborations', 'Wet', 'Hot', 'American', 'Summer', 'Role', 'Models', 'were', 'total', 'winners', 'mean', 'concept', 'taking', 'modern', 'hip', 'couple', 'throwing', 'hippie-style', 'commune', 'comedy', 'gold', 'So', 'then', 'where', 'did', 'go', 'wrong', 'Let', 'start', 'casting', 'Aniston', ""n't"", 'someone', ""'d"", 'expect', 'see', 'raunchy', 'comedy', 'suppose', 'stint', 'Horrible', 'Bosses', 'trying', 'hard', 'break', 'away', 'rom-com', 'typecasting', 'have', 'say', 'just', 'looked', 'fish', 'water', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'role', 'suited', 'Rudd', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'right', 'home', 'composed-man-meets-crazy-antics', 'act', 'practically', 'invented', 'perfected', 'dry', 'wit', 'sarcastic', 'humour', 'bit', 'movie', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'feel', 'everything', 'else', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'forced', 'top', 'be', 'funny', 'Wanderlust', 'was', 'let-down', 'way', 'up', 'Wain', 'previous', 'credits', 'Yes', 'characters', 'are', 'quirky', 'grow', 'be', 'too', 'awkward', 'unbelievable', 'liking', 'plot', 'was', 'mash-up', 'dull', 'hippy', 'clich', 'eacute', 'got', 'old', 'very', 'quickly', 'honestly', 'had', 'better', 'time', 'watching', 'trailer', 'did', 'feature-length', 'film', 'saying', 'something.Food', 'Thought', 'Wanderlust', 'one', 'movies', 'doomed', 'lay', 'failed-to-meet-expectations', 'graveyard', 'conventional', 'film', 'raunchy', 'sake', 'being', 'raunchy', 'far', 'memorable', 'generate', 'few', 'laughs', ""'d"", 'say', 'want', 'see', 'rental', 'best.Rating', '9733', '9733']",Wanderlust

1424434,A1IUE52O75XPZS,B004QL7K6G,teatime,"[6, 7]","I am a 30-something person who enjoys and has had much contact, and even temporarily lived with the kind of free-living people featured in the movie, and I think this homage is pure genius!  I usually don't think much of the two main actors at all (Rudd or Aniston), but they were good in this movie.  The hippie ensemble is absolutely perfect.  Just loved this movie and if you have a love for these counter-culture types, you will probably find it to be harmless fun; a good-humored poke at hippies.  The film takes every cliche about hippies ever and squeezes them into the commune characters, but it's ok because it's self-aware that's it's just a movie; it's actually not trying to be offensive to ""hippies"" but in an odd way it celebrates them in a loving way! My boyfriend agrees, we both know people like the ones on the commune and believe the film presents them as sincere idealists.Overall, the whole movie is light, fun, is full of memorable moments and characters, has some lowbrow humor scenes (but not as overt as other movies), and has a more unique storyline than the average comedy. Like the two main characters, I appreciate that counter culture, but can't live in it full time. Usually I can't abide ""raunchy"" movies, but this one is actually sweet.  The lowbrow humor is more about the incredible openness of the people versus the overwhelming private-ness of the outsiders, which is a very funny juxtaposition!The movie is optimistic, wacky, and perhaps a bit too graphic (nudity, etc., but mostly in a non-sexual way). Are you offended by briefly watching old nudists (in a non-sexual scene)? Really? Haven't you ever seen male genitalia before? The nudity would be essential to telling the story of such a community (of which there are hundreds across America), so I don't believe it to be gratuitous in this case. These people really exist out there; I've met people like pretty much all the characters or bits of them and THEY have zero shame or weirdness about being naked (but of course, WE feel weird about it, hence the comedy).  It's just how they are, so it's all plausible.Some interesting flaws of the unexamined, materialistic life are pointed out throughout the film, such as how the brother basically deals with excrement to buy fancy things, like a big house--a metaphor for how the main character (and we) all live working ""shoveling poop"" or working at a hateful job just to buy ""stuff"" that makes us miserable anyway; so it's not 100% fluff--there is a message behind the laughs.  I thought the movie got funny and wackier as it progressed, with a ridiculous ending to an incredulous story. Why does anyone want a realistic ending to a silly movie?  Perhaps people are too uptight with their expectations.  I especially liked how the Aniston and Rudd characters change because of their experience on the farm.  I would definitely recommend watching this if you are in a playful and open mood.I would definitely caution prudish, mainstream, or materialistic types from watching this movie--it's not for the uptight! I also don't think this movie is actually as ""raunchy"" as viewers might expect it to be.

1424437,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,B004QL7K6G,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[1, 3]","Paul Rudd must have a particular fondness for hippies because he seems to love either playing them or playing off them. They make for relatively easy laughs and breezy comedies, similar to Rudd's performance as the free-spirited moron in last year's Our Idiot Brother. Hippies are fun, and they make for relatively soft targets for a likable actor like Rudd. Wanderlust, the latest comedy from the Judd Apatow umbrella, has Rudd paired up with a familiar face in Jennifer Aniston. Even though the two haven't done a movie together since 1998's The Object of My Affection, they spent plenty of time together on the set of Friends. Their chemistry together is on point, and the bulk of the film's laughs come between one another. Separately, Wanderlust succumbs to a drowsy script that can't overcome the slight plot.George(Rudd) and Linda(Aniston) are a seemingly happy married couple devoted to the idea of setting up their lives in bustling New York City. He's a businessman of some sort, while she just seems to be drifting from career to career. At this point she wants to be a documentary film maker....about penguins with terminal cancer. It doesn't go well. But their commitment is strong, and are pushed by a hilariously unscrupulous real estate agent(Linda Lavin!!) into buying a high priced ""micro-loft"", which turns out to be a closet sized studio apartment. George almost immediately loses his job, whatever it was, and unable to afford the lifestyle, they find themselves headed to Atlanta to stay with his scummy but successful brother(Ken Marino).Disaster strikes during the interminable road trip, in the form of a hairy nudist(Joe Lo Truglio) and his floppy man sack chasing them into a freak accident. Forced to stay at the ironically named Elysium Bed & Breakfast, they discover that it's actually a hippie commune, or as its leader Seth(Justin Theroux) calls it, an ""intentional community"".  The big city folks quickly fall in love with the relaxed nature and the close-knit bonds forged among the denizens, and after a wild night of drinking, pot smoking, and being treated like beatnik royalty, George and Linda feel they've found a new home.No more stress, no more reliance on technology, and no more barriers.Basically every hippie joke you can think of becomes an instant factor, whether it's farm animals turning up in the oddest places, wacky acid trips, and shocking infringements on one's personal space. It's all stuff you've seen before, but Rudd and an excellent supporting cast do their best to make it work. You know from the start that Seth has his eyes on Linda, who is acclimating to the group better than George ever could hope to. You know where it's going, but Theroux shines as the manliest guy in a town full of pacifists.Rudd nearly saves the day, however, especially as George's perceptions of the group begin to shift from enthusiastic follower to caustic observer. Tempted by a free lovin' sex pot(Malin Akerman), George is willing to give up good food, bathroom privacy, and his favorite local coffee to give the lifestyle a shot. If only Rudd help from a better script, one which wasn't so devoted to skit show cliches. Too often the film feels razor thin, like screenwriters Ken Marino and director David Wain came up with the idea on the fly to do a hippie movie, but never got past the conceptual stage. Basically, it's like they just assembled a talented group of comedic heavyweights and said ""Have at it"". Not everybody is capable of making chicken salad out of chicken crap the way Rudd can, and unfortunately too many scenes don't work for that very reason. It's sad to watch the great Alan Alda wasting away with a one-note bit that is never funny, yet repeated over and over again as if we'll suddenly change our minds about it. Sometimes that works, but not often.A look at the trailers for the film show a number of scenes that were apparently left on the cutting room floor, which makes the inclusion of some of the worst jokes utterly confusing. George's excruciating, profanity-laden attempts to psych himself up for some guilt free sex is a serious low point. It's only matched by a mother who gives birth to a baby right at George's feet, then proceeds to lug the placenta around like luggage. Why is this funny?Nearly all of the offensively lame attempts at humor come in the second half of the film, when it appears that Wain and Co. basically threw in the towel. For the first hour or so, Wanderlust moves at a solid pace, letting it's two charming leads tell what was a clever fish-out-of-water story. Too bad it all vanishes in a puff of smoke.",2,Not even Paul Rudd can overcome this drowsy script,1332288000,"03 21, 2012",2012,4613,"['Paul', 'Rudd', 'must', 'have', 'particular', 'fondness', 'hippies', 'love', 'either', 'playing', 'playing', 'off', 'make', 'relatively', 'easy', 'laughs', 'breezy', 'comedies', 'similar', 'Rudd', 'performance', 'free-spirited', 'moron', 'last', 'year', 'Idiot', 'Brother', 'Hippies', 'are', 'fun', 'make', 'relatively', 'soft', 'targets', 'likable', 'actor', 'Rudd', 'Wanderlust', 'latest', 'comedy', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'umbrella', 'Rudd', 'paired', 'up', 'familiar', 'face', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Even', 'two', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'movie', 'together', '1998', 'Object', 'My', 'Affection', 'spent', 'plenty', 'time', 'together', 'set', 'Friends', 'chemistry', 'together', 'point', 'bulk', 'film', 'come', 'one', 'Separately', 'Wanderlust', 'drowsy', 'script', 'ca', ""n't"", 'overcome', 'slight', 'plot.George', 'Rudd', 'Linda', 'Aniston', 'are', 'seemingly', 'happy', 'married', 'couple', 'devoted', 'idea', 'setting', 'up', 'lives', 'bustling', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'businessman', 'sort', 'just', 'be', 'drifting', 'career', 'career', 'point', 'be', 'documentary', 'film', 'maker', '.about', 'penguins', 'terminal', 'cancer', ""n't"", 'go', 'well', 'commitment', 'strong', 'are', 'pushed', 'hilariously', 'unscrupulous', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'Linda', 'Lavin', 'buying', 'high', 'priced', 'micro-loft', 'out', 'be', 'closet', 'sized', 'studio', 'apartment', 'George', 'almost', 'immediately', 'job', 'whatever', 'was', 'unable', 'afford', 'lifestyle', 'find', 'headed', 'Atlanta', 'stay', 'scummy', 'successful', 'brother', 'Ken', 'Marino', '.Disaster', 'strikes', 'interminable', 'road', 'trip', 'form', 'hairy', 'nudist', 'Joe', 'Lo', 'Truglio', 'floppy', 'man', 'sack', 'chasing', 'freak', 'accident', 'Forced', 'stay', 'ironically', 'named', 'Elysium', 'Bed', 'Breakfast', 'discover', 'actually', 'hippie', 'commune', 'leader', 'Seth', 'Justin', 'Theroux', 'intentional', 'community', 'big', 'city', 'folks', 'quickly', 'fall', 'love', 'relaxed', 'nature', 'close-knit', 'bonds', 'forged', 'denizens', 'wild', 'night', 'drinking', 'pot', 'smoking', 'being', 'treated', 'beatnik', 'royalty', 'George', 'Linda', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'found', 'new', 'home.No', 'more', 'stress', 'more', 'reliance', 'technology', 'more', 'barriers.Basically', 'hippie', 'joke', 'can', 'think', 'becomes', 'instant', 'factor', 'farm', 'animals', 'turning', 'up', 'oddest', 'places', 'wacky', 'acid', 'trips', 'shocking', 'infringements', 'one', 'personal', 'space', 'stuff', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Rudd', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'do', 'best', 'make', 'work', 'know', 'start', 'Seth', 'eyes', 'Linda', 'who', 'acclimating', 'group', 'better', 'George', 'ever', 'could', 'hope', 'know', 'where', 'going', 'Theroux', 'shines', 'manliest', 'guy', 'town', 'full', 'pacifists.Rudd', 'nearly', 'day', 'however', 'especially', 'George', 'perceptions', 'group', 'shift', 'enthusiastic', 'follower', 'caustic', 'observer', 'Tempted', 'free', 'lovin', 'sex', 'pot', 'Malin', 'Akerman', 'George', 'willing', 'give', 'up', 'good', 'food', 'bathroom', 'privacy', 'favorite', 'local', 'coffee', 'give', 'lifestyle', 'shot', 'only', 'Rudd', 'help', 'better', 'script', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'devoted', 'skit', 'show', 'cliches', 'Too', 'often', 'film', 'feels', 'razor', 'thin', 'screenwriters', 'Ken', 'Marino', 'director', 'David', 'Wain', 'came', 'up', 'idea', 'fly', 'do', 'hippie', 'movie', 'never', 'got', 'conceptual', 'stage', 'Basically', 'just', 'assembled', 'talented', 'group', 'comedic', 'heavyweights', 'said', 'Have', 'Not', 'everybody', 'capable', 'making', 'chicken', 'salad', 'chicken', 'crap', 'way', 'Rudd', 'can', 'unfortunately', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'very', 'reason', 'sad', 'watch', 'great', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'wasting', 'away', 'one-note', 'bit', 'never', 'funny', 'yet', 'repeated', 'over', 'again', ""'ll"", 'suddenly', 'change', 'minds', 'not', 'often.A', 'look', 'trailers', 'film', 'show', 'number', 'scenes', 'were', 'apparently', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'inclusion', 'worst', 'jokes', 'utterly', 'confusing', 'George', 'excruciating', 'profanity-laden', 'attempts', 'psych', 'up', 'guilt', 'free', 'sex', 'serious', 'low', 'point', 'only', 'matched', 'mother', 'who', 'birth', 'baby', 'right', 'George', 'feet', 'then', 'lug', 'placenta', 'luggage', 'Why', 'funny', 'Nearly', 'offensively', 'lame', 'attempts', 'humor', 'come', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'when', 'Wain', 'Co.', 'basically', 'threw', 'towel', 'first', 'hour', 'so', 'Wanderlust', 'solid', 'pace', 'letting', 'two', 'charming', 'leads', 'tell', 'was', 'clever', 'fish-out-of-water', 'story', 'Too', 'bad', 'vanishes', 'puff', 'smoke']",Wanderlust

The movie is great for film students wanting to learn how NOT to portray a romantic interest, because they made Theroux so foolish that I can't imagine how he'll receive future roles or be considered attractive.  Or maybe I'm wrong, Aniston seems to star in failure after failure and works steadily, so....Very, very unfunny and just plain strange movie, its shocking that they released it at all.  And, though I was pleasantly surprised to see a few of the cast members from the ancient MTV comedy show The State (which I enjoyed, I think I was the only one), I know that movies which they star in are usually not so great, so I was immediately suspicious, and my suspicions were correct.I have no idea if they--The State members, wrote the script, and I don't even care enough to find out, but I will tell you this; I truly could have gone without seeing one of The State members in full frontal nudity scenes, I'm not prudishly opposed to nudity, I just don't want to see him naked, thank you very much, its just too weird.  And finally, it was hard to watch an incredible actor like Alan Alda in this film, for a lot of reasons.",1,I really can't believe these actors get paid for this...,1345939200,"08 26, 2012",2012,1292,"['had', 'stop', 'movie', 'fifty', 'minutes', 'was', 'actually', 'becoming', 'embarrassed', 'actors', 'especially', 'Theroux', 'character', 'was', 'cringeworthiest', 'movie', 'great', 'film', 'students', 'wanting', 'learn', 'how', 'NOT', 'portray', 'romantic', 'interest', 'made', 'Theroux', 'foolish', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'how', ""'ll"", 'receive', 'future', 'roles', 'be', 'considered', 'attractive', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'Aniston', 'star', 'failure', 'failure', 'steadily', '.Very', 'very', 'unfunny', 'just', 'plain', 'strange', 'movie', 'shocking', 'released', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'see', 'few', 'cast', 'members', 'ancient', 'MTV', 'comedy', 'show', 'State', 'enjoyed', 'think', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'know', 'movies', 'star', 'are', 'usually', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'was', 'immediately', 'suspicious', 'suspicions', 'were', 'correct.I', 'have', 'idea', 'State', 'members', 'wrote', 'script', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'care', 'enough', 'find', 'out', 'will', 'tell', 'truly', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'seeing', 'one', 'State', 'members', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'scenes', ""'m"", 'not', 'prudishly', 'opposed', 'nudity', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'naked', 'thank', 'very', 'much', 'just', 'too', 'weird', 'finally', 'was', 'hard', 'watch', 'incredible', 'actor', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'film', 'lot', 'reasons']",Wanderlust
