I had a couple of episodes on tape that I watched over the years.  I bought the first few seasons on dvd.  I've been watching the third one and I think the show holds up well.  It's funny, weird, and sad at times.  It reminds me of Punky Brewster in some ways.  Teaching lessons and showing that family is important.  If you love 80s sitcoms you should enjoy Webster.Be sure to check out the really cheesy episode called ""Almost Home"".  It was supposed to be a pilot for a spin-off, but it never got picked up.  It has a lot of bad acting and bad writing.
