Kapustar,"[1, 1]","Baby Blood is a weird little French horror film but very effective.It starts out with a Creature from the Black Lagoon beginning explaining the origin of the monster from the beginning of the creation of earth.The creature enters the womb of a well built circus owners wife who is treated abusively by him.  He is extremely possessive so when she disscovers she is mysterously pregnant she flees. The creature keeps talking to the host and you hear the conversations as she goes between thoughts of sucide and mothers  love for the alien inside her body.The creature in the womb needs blood to survive so many bloody murders follow as the mother and creature head to the sea where the creature says he must live.There is nudity,much blood and a crazy story.everything modern horror fans will love.I highly recommend theis movie.",4,weird but effective,1247097600,"07 9, 2009",2009,828,"['Baby', 'Blood', 'weird', 'little', 'French', 'horror', 'film', 'very', 'effective.It', 'out', 'Creature', 'Black', 'Lagoon', 'beginning', 'explaining', 'origin', 'monster', 'beginning', 'creation', 'earth.The', 'creature', 'womb', 'well', 'built', 'circus', 'owners', 'wife', 'who', 'treated', 'abusively', 'extremely', 'possessive', 'so', 'when', 'mysterously', 'pregnant', 'creature', 'talking', 'host', 'hear', 'conversations', 'thoughts', 'sucide', 'mothers', 'love', 'alien', 'body.The', 'creature', 'womb', 'blood', 'survive', 'so', 'many', 'bloody', 'murders', 'follow', 'mother', 'creature', 'head', 'sea', 'where', 'creature', 'must', 'live.There', 'nudity', 'much', 'blood', 'crazy', 'story.everything', 'modern', 'horror', 'fans', 'will', 'love.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'theis', 'movie']",N/A
383324,A1EGZYG8PC51U5,6303640540,"D. Wilson ""SonRisedInTheEast""","[3, 4]","Baby Blood (also known as The Evil Within) tells the story of a woman who is impregnated with an ancient entity... that craves blood for sustenance and eventual birth.  This is a French horror film by director Alain Roback (unfortuantely never did anything else worth note) that Anchor Bay has deservingly exhumed and released featuring everything intact and completely uncut (kinda like what they did with the Deep Red DVD, some lost footage has subtitles).  This is less a horror film than an exploitation picture but it provides more than enough uncomfortable (especially if you are female I would guess) and macabre scenes to keep you entertained.  The scenes of gore and violence are extreme while remaining really well-done, almost like mixing the over the top stylings of Dead Alive with the surrealism of Cemetary Man (and who doesn't love both those movies?)in a really grimey pot.  Yanka, our female lead spends a good portion of the first quarter of the film either scantilly clad or completely full-frontal nude and although not that attractive (Mike Strahan type gap in teeth, frizzy hair, black circles under eyes) I was in need of a cold shower by the time the credits rolled.  All in all a very entertaining and original movie, that although may be nothing more than exploitative sleaze... remains really, really good exploitative sleaze!",4,"How do you say ""sleazy, splatter, cinema"" in French?

383326,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6303640540,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 2]","Baby Blood (Alain Robak, 1990)I started feeling a lot better about Baby Blood once I realized it was supposed to be a comedy. At least, I think it was supposed to be a comedy. They couldn't have intended some of those scenes seriously, could they?The film concerns Yanka (Emmanuelle Escourrou), a rather lovely young carny who becomes impregnated by, well, something. Dissatisfied with her carnival life, and under the command of the thing now growing inside her, she leaves the carnival and sets off on a killing spree to get blood to feed the creature.Yeah, that's pretty much the entire plot. Still, despite the thinness of the plot and the obvious fact that Robak treated this as pretty much a straight exploitation film (it's right up Joe Bob Briggs' alley), there's something under the hood here, whether it's the film's warped sense of humor (one of the best scenes involves Yanka hijacking a bloodmobile) or the fact that there's actually character development, or Robak's approach to stereotypes (Richard the womanizer could easily drive a film of his own), this didn't come off as just-another-blood-breasts-and-beasts flick. I grant you, it doesn't come off as a deathless piece of filmmaking, either, but it's not a mindless action-horror film, either. If you're a fan of the outer edges of the horror genre, this is definitely one you should consider hunting down. ***",3,Amusingly gory.,1185926400,"08 1, 2007",2007,1381,"['Baby', 'Blood', 'Alain', 'Robak', '1990', 'started', 'feeling', 'lot', 'better', 'Baby', 'Blood', 'once', 'realized', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'comedy', 'least', 'think', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'comedy', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'intended', 'scenes', 'seriously', 'could', 'film', 'concerns', 'Yanka', 'Emmanuelle', 'Escourrou', 'rather', 'lovely', 'young', 'carny', 'who', 'impregnated', 'well', 'something', 'Dissatisfied', 'carnival', 'life', 'command', 'thing', 'now', 'growing', 'carnival', 'sets', 'off', 'killing', 'spree', 'get', 'blood', 'feed', 'creature.Yeah', 'pretty', 'much', 'entire', 'plot', 'Still', 'thinness', 'plot', 'obvious', 'fact', 'Robak', 'treated', 'pretty', 'much', 'straight', 'exploitation', 'film', 'right', 'up', 'Joe', 'Bob', 'Briggs', 'alley', 'something', 'hood', 'here', 'film', 'warped', 'sense', 'humor', 'one', 'best', 'scenes', 'Yanka', 'hijacking', 'bloodmobile', 'fact', 'actually', 'character', 'development', 'Robak', 'approach', 'stereotypes', 'Richard', 'womanizer', 'could', 'easily', 'drive', 'film', 'own', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'just-another-blood-breasts-and-beasts', 'flick', 'grant', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'deathless', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'either', 'not', 'mindless', 'action-horror', 'film', 'either', ""'re"", 'fan', 'outer', 'edges', 'horror', 'genre', 'definitely', 'one', 'should', 'consider', 'hunting', 'down', '***']",N/A

383328,A1H7PH075VTHO8,6303640540,Sir Jub-Jub,"[1, 2]","""Baby Blood"" starts out promising, reminding me somewhat of ""Freaks"" with its circus setting. It seems that some sort of parasitic creature has infected one of the circus animals. It eventually breaks out, invades a woman and then she goes on a killing spree to ""feed"" her host baby. There is a fair amount of blood spurting and nudity but not much else. The film depicts the communication between the woman and her parasitic invader and this voice over stuff never really works. It is basically a road trip story with the woman moving from place to place and then killing someone. One thing that I found amusing is that there is a lengthy period towards the end of the film where the woman is covered in blood. No one seems to really care or even ask if she is okay, they treat her requsts for a ride as if she looked otherwise normal. You would think that if someone walked up to you covered in blood you would at least take notice.

383329,A3VROBXAJDF6MA,6303640540,"""vincentarlock""","[3, 3]","This isn't the greatest horror flick I've ever seen but is definitely above average and has a suprisingly good amount of gore. The movie begins by showing you a beast that has been captured in the African jungle. This beast, a jaguar, is particularly fierce...as if something is inside of it and making it so. It arrives at a circus where are leading female character lives with her abusive, circus manager boyfriend. The mere sight of the creature causes the other animals to get ancy and aggressive. Later that night, the manager wakes up, leaves his sleeping girlfriend and wanders about the circus. He finds the animal tamer weeping in front of the jaguar's cage as the beast is splattered about the cage (as if something emerged from within). Something did and it finds its way to the sleeping woman and creeps up into her womb. From this point on the movie follows her and the evil within her, which by the way can communicate with her. It needs blood to grow and drives her to seduce and kill as many people as she can in order to nourish they creature within her womb. The movie culminates with the birth of the creature and from there...things can only get bloodier as the abmonination emerges from its newborn skin and slithers onto a bus full of futbol players. This is a pretty simple plot and it is presented in a very easy to follow fashion. The female lead is attractive in a euro sort of way and the dialogue between her and the creature in her womb pretty much carries the film between the violence. The scenes of gore are suprisingly good, especially a scene towards the end that takes place in a ambulance.
