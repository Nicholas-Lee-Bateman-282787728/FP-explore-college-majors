I never loved it, but it was indeed an interesting angle on the alien invasion. How did they do it in the movie? As to make temperature high( for they can not survive cold), and overtake the Earth, for them we do not deserve it. They have a base with their technology deep underground and they are killing those who might find out about them(aka. team of scientists or 3 scientists). I didn't like the model of the aliens, nor that they are taking the full-body masks to walk among us. But it was okay to see how some of them may just look like and adapt to be among us just for a short time. In the movie, they basically hunt us and fast overtaking the Earth. How did they make it that far? And what was the support? Of course for humanity one of them must be a multi-millionaire.

It's in a space somewhere between pure camp and serious sci-fi drama.Charlie Sheen is very entertaining and believable as a radio astronomer that discovers a strange radio signal which proves to be a first step in uncovering a big plot that is the sort of thing you hear coming from a paranoid schizophrenic in a mental institution. Or one of those weird late night radio shows that fields calls from crazy morons. ""The aliens are behind it! Blah, blah, blah..."" It's like they simply took some nut job's story and made it into a movie. Sheen is one of the biggest reasons why the movie works. He's so intense and on the edge... really just pitch perfect in this role. Sheen's slightly over the top performance is what keeps the movie fun and from getting too weighed down with it's own bull----. Just look at the facial expressions.

Things started to get heated and come to find out his situation was not only the heated situation. The space aliens where trying to heat up the atmosphere so they could inhabit the earth. Well, from his garage he ended up going to Central America to fine that these aligns had built some kind of building that ended up housing their facilities and atmosphere heater. Well, by the end of the move he was able to get the aliens to put there plans on hold. In Arrival II Zane Zaminsky had moved to Alaska and was killed And there was limited to no info on how he was killed. So Zane had some Mailers made up to be sent out in case of his death. I really was not much in to Arrival II but there was one guy Jack Addison who was a Computer Programmer who was never really into his work.

No, in this movie they are already here! I've seen this movie several times and always find it fun to watch. So, let's start with Charlie Sheen who plays a (non-comical) radio astronomer. Nice to see him playing a real character without the jokes and womanizing. He makes a discovery of a radio signal beaming from Mexico to a distant planet. ""They"" have been keeping an eye on him and get him fired from his job and banded from the telescope. Sheen uses a series of TV dishes in the neighborhood to create a radio telescope ganged array to resume his search for that signal. Eventually he travels to Mexico to look for the source of the signal. Let's just say he discovers several twin brothers for his old boss; hummm? Soon he begins to discover that not all of the towns people are human.This is a fun sci-fi movie with some good effects. The effects are in good check and not too many; this is a sci-fi story movie.

Until the advent of Blu-Ray technology, Laserdiscs were the best video format available..THE ARRIVAL is a nightmarish sci-fier about an astronomer who first tunes into alien broadcasts and later discovers these shape-shifters have already come to Earth and are actively adapting our eco-system to their liking. The plan is to poison our atmosphere with greenhouse gases, thus raising the planet's mean temperature by about 25F.Ron Silver is outstanding as an ET who's infiltrated JPL, the hi-tech company that Sheen works for, by morphing into and then replacing the boss Sheen reports to. When Charlie brings taped evidence of otherworldly broadcasts to Silver, he's fired from his job and the tape is destroyed. Sheen's partner in the radio location project (Richard Schiff) is murdered, but it's arranged to look like a suicide. This event and his job termination don't deter Sheen from working independently to tune into and capture on tape the transmissions he'd previously picked up.When a signal originating from Mexico crosses in with the outer space one, Charlie travels there to locate the source. This is how he meets Lindsay Crouse, a climatologist investigating massive levels of greenhouse emissions. Their opportunity to work together ends when Crouse is murdered. Worse, Sheen is made to look like her killer after he trespasses at the supposed power plant, one of several that's ""terraforming"" Earth into a hothouse, and learns the full extent of the creepy-looking aliens' invasion and plans.Confronting Silver with what he's learned just makes Charlie a target for elimination. The story's exciting climax occurs at a satellite dish broadcasting base, where Sheen and his girlfriend, Teri Polo, battle for both their lives and the survival of all humankind.This great start to what could've been a phenomenal movie series was unfortunately kiboshed by an extremely mediocre sequel.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(6.2) The Arrival (USA/Mexico-1996) - Charlie Sheen/Lindsay Crouse/Richard Schiff/Ron Silver/Teri Polo",5,"""What is this, 'Tales from the Darkside'?

77387,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,0784012822,Brian Driver,"[0, 0]","A term that is commonly tossed around when it comes to sci-fi (or any other kind of fiction, really) is ""the willing suspension of disbelief."" It means, of course, that you have to make the audience WANT TO believe in your film. When a work of fiction can convince its audience that its story could very well be true, it has passed the first and perhaps most important test that sci-fi, especially, depends upon. If that ""willing suspension"" is not accomplished, the result can be laughable: I remember seeing the zipper on a monster's suit once (it was an old black and white horror film) and from then on I could only see what was comically wrong with the. But when it's done well - which is so much easier to say than do - your audience is right on your side.THE ARRIVAL more than accomplishes this important first step.  Mind you, it's notContact- another good movie about contact from beings outside our planet - but it is not trying to be. Whereas CONTACT had a plethora of A-name actors (Jodi Foster, Matthew McConaughey and others...) acting in a script from a notable scientist (Carl Sagan), and at that time a high-end director (Robert Zemeckis, who'd just completedForrest Gump), THE ARRIVAL really came out of nowhere.  Director and writer David Twohy had only one directorial role to his credit four years earlier: Timescape, which actually goes by a different name,Grand Tour: Disaster in Time. So THE ARRIVAL was really a movie in which a small, unproven director was given a small cast (starring fellow B-listers Lindsay Crouse and Ron Silver) and a small budget ($25 million) with which he might prove himself. Sadly, this film didn't do it for him...it only originally pulled in about $14 million.Oddly enough, though, ask around: you might be surprised by how many of your friends have already seen it.The plot is, briefly: Charlie Sheen is Zane Zaminsky, who works for SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence), hears the exact kind of radio signal that means BIG news, and he reports it to his boss.  What happens is a complete surprise: he's fired (claiming budget cuts) and finds he can't work anywhere...he's been blacklisted. Frustrated, when he finally lands a job as a television satellite installer he uses it to gather equipment and set up his own radio post in his garage. It isn't too long before his explorations begin to take him on a trip that leads him to Mexico, where he finds for sure that the aliens aren't just OUT THERE, they're HERE, too...on our planet, and ingraining themselves into our society. As you can imagine, it isn't long before the poop hits the fan.And yes, even though Charlie Sheen has been a giant tool, lately, he did a great job making this film almost two decades ago...in fact, rather than being a distraction, he was a good deal of the reason I liked it. He more than ably conveyed the frantic alienation (despite the pun, I do mean it literally) that any of us would feel if we alone found proof of an alien infiltration among our race, and he was a perfect fit for this movie.Of course, a good deal of the credit must go to writer and director David Twohy (who went on to directRiddick Trilogy (Pitch Black / The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury / The Chronicles of Riddick)), has put together a really good alien movie here.  It is far from merely sensational, and I found it to be quite believable. Given the subject matter, that's asking a lot...and he/they really delivered.What I really liked was how seamlessly Twohy moved the viewer along from the first blip in the radio waves to aliens actually working their way into our society...THE ARRIVAL does a credible job of making their discovery here move along from the IM-possible to the possible to the ""Oh, crap...they're here!"" stage. Sheen's barely controlled mannerisms work well here: he has a personality that seems to blend well with paranoia and suspicion (this shouldn't be news to anyone). And the special effects work well here too: a ""tornado"" inside a building is handled well, and a neat trick with alien physiology is conveyed nicely, too: you'll definitely know by this characteristic who THEY are.Thank the heavens for DVDs, where THE ARRIVAL has made its mark. It hasn't really arrived at cult film status, nor will it, most likely.  But if you want to have 90 minutes filled with mounting tension, a credible story, and a well-acted sci-fi thriller with good special effects, you could do worse than rent this movie.(NOTE for anyone who wants to give a negative review: please leave a comment to help me do better next time.)",4,Arrived...and Ready,1368144000,"05 10, 2013",2013,4572,"['term', 'commonly', 'tossed', 'when', 'sci-fi', 'other', 'kind', 'fiction', 'really', 'willing', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'course', 'have', 'make', 'audience', 'WANT', 'TO', 'believe', 'film', 'When', 'work', 'fiction', 'can', 'convince', 'audience', 'story', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'true', 'passed', 'first', 'perhaps', 'most', 'important', 'test', 'sci-fi', 'especially', 'upon', 'willing', 'suspension', 'not', 'accomplished', 'result', 'can', 'be', 'laughable', 'remember', 'seeing', 'zipper', 'monster', 'suit', 'once', 'was', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'horror', 'film', 'then', 'could', 'only', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'comically', 'wrong', 'when', 'done', 'well', 'so', 'much', 'easier', 'say', 'do', 'audience', 'right', 'side.THE', 'ARRIVAL', 'more', 'accomplishes', 'important', 'first', 'step', 'Mind', 'notContact-', 'good', 'movie', 'contact', 'beings', 'planet', 'not', 'trying', 'be', 'Whereas', 'CONTACT', 'had', 'plethora', 'A-name', 'actors', 'Jodi', 'Foster', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'others', 'acting', 'script', 'notable', 'scientist', 'Carl', 'Sagan', 'time', 'high-end', 'director', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'who', ""'d"", 'just', 'completedForrest', 'Gump', 'THE', 'ARRIVAL', 'really', 'came', 'nowhere', 'Director', 'writer', 'David', 'Twohy', 'had', 'only', 'one', 'directorial', 'role', 'credit', 'four', 'years', 'earlier', 'Timescape', 'actually', 'different', 'name', 'Grand', 'Tour', 'Disaster', 'Time', 'THE', 'ARRIVAL', 'was', 'really', 'movie', 'small', 'unproven', 'director', 'was', 'given', 'small', 'cast', 'starring', 'fellow', 'B-listers', 'Lindsay', 'Crouse', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'small', 'budget', '25', 'million', 'might', 'prove', 'Sadly', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'only', 'originally', 'pulled', 'about', '14', 'million.Oddly', 'enough', 'ask', 'might', 'be', 'surprised', 'how', 'many', 'friends', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'it.The', 'plot', 'briefly', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'Zane', 'Zaminsky', 'who', 'SETI', 'Search', 'Extra-Terrestrial', 'Intelligence', 'exact', 'kind', 'radio', 'signal', 'BIG', 'news', 'boss', 'What', 'complete', 'surprise', 'fired', 'claiming', 'budget', 'cuts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'work', 'anywhere', 'been', 'blacklisted', 'Frustrated', 'when', 'finally', 'job', 'television', 'satellite', 'installer', 'gather', 'equipment', 'set', 'up', 'own', 'radio', 'post', 'garage', ""n't"", 'too', 'long', 'explorations', 'begin', 'take', 'trip', 'Mexico', 'where', 'sure', 'aliens', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'OUT', 'THERE', ""'re"", 'HERE', 'too', 'planet', 'ingraining', 'society', 'can', 'imagine', ""n't"", 'long', 'poop', 'fan.And', 'yes', 'even', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'been', 'giant', 'tool', 'lately', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'film', 'almost', 'two', 'decades', 'fact', 'rather', 'being', 'distraction', 'was', 'good', 'deal', 'reason', 'liked', 'more', 'ably', 'conveyed', 'frantic', 'alienation', 'pun', 'do', 'mean', 'literally', 'would', 'feel', 'alone', 'found', 'proof', 'alien', 'infiltration', 'race', 'was', 'perfect', 'fit', 'movie.Of', 'course', 'good', 'deal', 'credit', 'must', 'go', 'writer', 'director', 'David', 'Twohy', 'who', 'went', 'directRiddick', 'Trilogy', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'Chronicles', 'Riddick', 'Dark', 'Fury', '/', 'Chronicles', 'Riddick', 'put', 'together', 'really', 'good', 'alien', 'movie', 'here', 'far', 'merely', 'sensational', 'found', 'be', 'quite', 'believable', 'Given', 'subject', 'matter', 'asking', 'lot', 'he/they', 'really', 'delivered.What', 'really', 'liked', 'was', 'how', 'seamlessly', 'Twohy', 'moved', 'viewer', 'first', 'blip', 'radio', 'aliens', 'actually', 'working', 'way', 'society', 'ARRIVAL', 'credible', 'job', 'making', 'discovery', 'here', 'move', 'along', 'IM-possible', 'possible', 'Oh', 'crap', ""'re"", 'here', 'stage', 'Sheen', 'barely', 'controlled', 'mannerisms', 'work', 'well', 'here', 'personality', 'blend', 'well', 'paranoia', 'suspicion', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'news', 'anyone', 'special', 'effects', 'work', 'well', 'here', 'too', 'tornado', 'building', 'handled', 'well', 'neat', 'trick', 'alien', 'physiology', 'conveyed', 'nicely', 'too', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'know', 'characteristic', 'who', 'THEY', 'are.Thank', 'heavens', 'DVDs', 'where', 'THE', 'ARRIVAL', 'made', 'mark', ""n't"", 'really', 'arrived', 'cult', 'film', 'status', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'want', 'have', '90', 'minutes', 'filled', 'mounting', 'tension', 'credible', 'story', 'well-acted', 'sci-fi', 'thriller', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'could', 'do', 'worse', 'rent', 'movie', 'NOTE', 'anyone', 'who', 'give', 'negative', 'review', 'please', 'leave', 'comment', 'help', 'do', 'better', 'next', 'time']",N/A

Landing in Mexico about a third of the way through the film kicks into hyperdrive and never lets you stop to catch your breath.  Teri Polo gives a star-making performance as the not-so-supportive girlfriend whose own identity is a running mystery.

It was watched on a 42"" Panasonic Plasma and Panasonic BD35 player. The film itself is very clear and has a marked improvement over the SD. However, I was surprised to see a very subdued color palette (the reason for the 4/5, overall). Perhaps the director intended it to look this way, but it was still a bit strange, especially in some scenes, where I expected colors to pop.It felt like I had turned the color down (which I had not), and even the grass, trees and any other color rich items in scenes were just not very vivid. However, I must rave about the DTS sound! It is very powerful and I absolutely recommend renting or purchasing this disc if you're a fan of the film. There are several thunderous scenes where the DTS really shines, and is very enjoyable.The film itself contains some poor acting, but the storyline is what has always attracted me to this film. I am a huge fan of space, exploration and alien films, and while a bit comical at times, this one offers some neat little surprises in the storyline. Since visual effects technology has progressed significantly, even over the last 10 years, it's worth noting that the effects of the actual creatures are eye candy for fans of this genre. Charlie Sheen's mission to prove the existence of extra-terrestrials, by constructing his own super antenna drives the film, and creates the ""1 man against the world"", theme that is very enjoyable. You want him to succeed, and watching the film unfold is fun. However, there are no special features on te disc, which was very disappointing for me.

77409,A2XSGVBHS37L2B,0784012822,"D. Mills ""WatchThis""","[0, 0]","I have always had soft spot for this movie, but it takes a certain frame of mind to cruise through its alternating quirky and inspired moments. The template for this film really is 'The Invaders', a late 60s ABC-TV alien  invasion yarn. There, Roy Thinnes played an architect who had stumbled upon a flying saucer landing behind the proverbial deserted diner, and spent two television seasons trying to convince the world of a growing menace spawned by 'alien beings from a dying planet out to make it (Earth) THEIR world'.'The Arrival'  feels a lot more like television than the silver screen. Right off the bat, there are eccentric but likable characters, moments of overacting, and attempts at humor (some more successful than others). Then there's Charlie Sheen playing scientist Zane Zaminksi, fulfilling the role of everyman trying to convince a disbelieving world that they're being invaded. It's probably the most inspired case of miscasting that I have ever witnessed. As he squints through his geeky spectacles at his CRT while the aliens' ""wow' signal comes along, are we supposed to take him seriously? In the end, it doesn't matter. He gets fired from his astronomer job (is he getting just a bit too close to the alien plans?), works as a PacBell support tech,which turns out to be the best thing for someone embarking on an alien-hunting career, and heads off to Mexico once he has figured out the aliens' plans. There, he teams up with an environmental scientist (portrayed by the ever-earnest Lindsay Crouse), who had noted that poppies are growing in the arctic, and located a 'hot spot' in Mexico where one of several hidden power plants have been constructed. Could the nasty invaders be responsible for the drastic global warming she has discovered?In the end, the hapless Zaminski fails to expose the nasty invaders for what they are, just as Roy Thinnes experienced ultimate frustration back in 1968. 'The Arrival' could have been a pilot for a perfectly good sci-fi series, and if viewed in this spirit, it's a jolly good show. The Blu-Ray transfer is superb, but there are no extras - a pity, since simple interviews with Sheen or director David Twohy would have been welcome.

Of course, unnecessary follow-ups are a rule of thumb, so a sequel to The Arrival seemed pretty inevitable, especially when you consider its ending. Too bad this ""continuation"" lacks all the qualities of its predecessors, namely in good writing, acting, and inspired direction. I actually purchased the Arrival II on DVD...as it was a double feature with the original. Before I even popped the film in, I was expecting ...from the first minute, so the best thing I can say is that the movie turned out to be a bit more watchable than I expected.The Arrival II is set in Montreal, two months after the events of the original. Radio astronomer Zane Zaminski has died of an apparent heart attack, but he did manage to send out info of the alien invasion to his most trusted colleagues, as well as to his stepbrother, Jack Addison (Patrick Muldoon), and a news reporter (Jane Sibbett, Ross' lesbian ex-wife from Friends). This group becomes the targets of the aliens, until the only survivors are Muldoon and Sibbett, who go on the run together and try to expose the aliens' nefarious plans.The Arrival II suffers distinctly from a lack of freshness, which is much needed in a sequel that's meant to continue a running story. All the material we have here is pretty much repeat. Basically, we know there are aliens out there disguised as human beings and they're whole goal is to terraform the Earth and mold it into an environment suitable for their own colonization. Oh, and let's not forget that spherical object with a strong vacuum pull.Like the original, we've got our ""intelligent"" protagonist (we find this out because everyone keeps telling him he's smarter than he thinks) and blonde chick that plays as love interest. Problem is, these two are played by Patrick Muldoon and Jane Sibbett, neither of whom I've seen in anything on film or TV that suggests they can act. Muldoon is mostly expressionless, though occasionally has that ""whoa, dude"" act that would give Freddie Prinze, Jr. a run for his money. Sibbett is simply dreadful as the reporter. Let's put it this way, those who found Courtney Cox unconvincing as Gail Weathers in the Scream series will be shouting ""Come back! All is forgiven!"" The other performances aren't worth noting, except maybe Catherine Blythe, who gives the movie its sole bit of very gratuitous nudity.The script has little to none of the intelligence of the original and it often mistakes scientific mumbo-jumbo as smart screenwriting. The plot's got a lot of twists and turns, mostly involving a guessing game of who's human and who's not. None of these little revelations are the slightest bit surprising, and they might even induce a few scoffs here and there.The special effects on display range from pretty bad to hilariously awful, the worst bit probably being when one of the aliens reveals its true identity. There are a lot of other clunkers, such as the cheesy-looking holographic displays and the destruction of a power plant in the film's conclusion. Yeah, visual effects themselves usually don't determine a movie's quality, but they sure don't help the film here.Directed by Kevin S.

77415,A7RM685PHBK20,0784012822,Eric,"[54, 62]","The Arrival is a little known science fiction thriller thatarrived in the early summer of 1996 a year that is much more wellknown for a little film called Independence Day.  Both movies are about alien invasions, but are different in execution and style.  As to where Independence Day is an action film about visuals and explosions, The Arrival focuses on paranoia, plausibility, and drawing the audience in with an intriguing and credible plot.Zane Ziminski (Charlie Sheen) and his partner Calvin (Richard Schiff) are radio astronomers who have picked up a signal from outer space, just around a star called Wolf 336, which is 14.6 light years away from Earth. Arrival is writer David Twohy's directorial debut (his other work is Pitch Black, another great sci-fi thriller) and he does a very good job.  He makes the plot quite intelligent and keeps the pace moving quickly with a riveting finale.  The underlying paranoia is one of the aspects that fuels this movie along.  X-Files fans should definitely enjoy this film and get a kick out of it.Many critics seemed to think Charlie Sheen was miscast, though I find no credibility in that statement.  He is superb in his role as a normal guy who gets caught up in a dangerous conspiracy.  His entire performance is very believable and it's easy to feel sympathetic and root for him at the same time.  The supporting performances are decent, with Teri Polo and Lindsay Cruise doing fine jobs as the women in Zane's life.  Ron Silver is particularly menacing as a CEO executive of SETI and he plays his part with a lot of subtlety.There's a lot of scientific talk in this film with many ideas thrown around and developed but it's doubtful viewers will get lost in this film's plot.  It may seem confusing at first but it starts to become clear by the middle and the end.",5,The most underrated sci-fi/thriller of the 90's,954028800,"03 26, 2000",2000,1820,"['Arrival', 'little', 'known', 'science', 'fiction', 'thriller', 'thatarrived', 'early', 'summer', '1996', 'year', 'much', 'more', 'wellknown', 'little', 'film', 'called', 'Independence', 'Day', 'movies', 'are', 'alien', 'invasions', 'are', 'different', 'execution', 'style', 'where', 'Independence', 'Day', 'action', 'film', 'visuals', 'explosions', 'Arrival', 'paranoia', 'plausibility', 'drawing', 'audience', 'intriguing', 'credible', 'plot.Zane', 'Ziminski', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'partner', 'Calvin', 'Richard', 'Schiff', 'are', 'radio', 'astronomers', 'who', 'have', 'picked', 'up', 'signal', 'outer', 'space', 'just', 'star', 'called', 'Wolf', '336', '14.6', 'light', 'years', 'away', 'Earth', 'Arrival', 'writer', 'David', 'Twohy', 'directorial', 'debut', 'other', 'work', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'great', 'sci-fi', 'thriller', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'plot', 'quite', 'intelligent', 'pace', 'moving', 'quickly', 'riveting', 'finale', 'underlying', 'paranoia', 'one', 'aspects', 'fuels', 'movie', 'along', 'X-Files', 'fans', 'should', 'definitely', 'enjoy', 'film', 'get', 'kick', 'it.Many', 'critics', 'seemed', 'think', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'was', 'miscast', 'find', 'credibility', 'statement', 'superb', 'role', 'normal', 'guy', 'who', 'caught', 'up', 'dangerous', 'conspiracy', 'entire', 'performance', 'very', 'believable', 'easy', 'feel', 'sympathetic', 'root', 'same', 'time', 'supporting', 'performances', 'are', 'decent', 'Teri', 'Polo', 'Lindsay', 'Cruise', 'doing', 'fine', 'jobs', 'women', 'Zane', 'life', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'particularly', 'menacing', 'CEO', 'executive', 'SETI', 'part', 'lot', 'subtlety.There', 'lot', 'scientific', 'talk', 'film', 'many', 'ideas', 'thrown', 'around', 'developed', 'doubtful', 'viewers', 'will', 'get', 'lost', 'film', 'plot', 'may', 'seem', 'confusing', 'first', 'become', 'clear', 'middle', 'end']",N/A

77419,A39C2BQXZHOUMJ,0784012822,G. Dowling,"[5, 5]","""The Arrival"" is an interesting new classic.  Back when it was released, it came ou the same summer as ""Independence Day"" and was considered the counter-programming to that big-budget blockbuster for its emphasis on character and story as opposed to huse special effects.  ""The Arrival"" tells the story of a scientist (played with suprising nuance and likability by Charlie Sheen) who comes across an alien signal (a la ""Contact"") from another world.  This leads him on a chase to discover the meaning of the signal and who (or what) sent them.  I won't put spoilers in, but I will say one of the twists of the story is what makes ""The Arrival"" remain remarkably relevant.  The motives and activities of the aliens are explained in such a way that blurs the lines as to who is right, whereas in ID4, the aliens were merely evil.  Great supporting performances by Richard Schiff,Terri Polo, the late Ron Silver, and the always wonderful and compelling Lindsay Crouse.  Writer-Director David Twohy (The Chronicles of Riddick, The Perfect Getaway) makes the movie quite exciting and intelligent and while the special effects are not on par with ID4 (to compare by time period), they are dazzling in their own way because they are interesting and mean something.  ""The Arrival"" is a suprisingly exhilarating ride, where the ideas are more exciting than any special effect.Fans of the movie will be delighted by this Blu-ray 1080p transfer.  The picture has flaws such as the colors not being as vivid as they should and the use of DNR which created some smearing and washing out of the brighter scenes.  I will say that I think this has more to do with the source material and its budget constraints.  DNR, I suspect was used on the source material if the original print was damaged.  Overall it looks great with some very vivid colors and jaw-droppingly fine detail for a movie of its age.  It has never looked better and leave previous prints in the dust.  Very nice looking.The audio is amazing.  LionsGate continues to treat us with its catalogue releases with a DTS-HD MA 7.1 lossless soundtrack.  ""The Arrival"" has never sounded this great, with fabulously aggressive sound, terrific directional and ambient sound effects, and crisp dialogue.  Just look at the scene where the aliens plant an otherwordly ball on Zane's lab that creates a vortec which sucks away all his equipment, emptying the room.  The scene is loud, awesome bass and directional effects, and the visual effects look great.  The climactic action sequence atop a massic satellite dish looks and sounds phenomenal as well.The only disappointment for me is the absence of any special features.  A commentary would have been great (David Twohy is fan of doing these, so what gives?) or some kind of making of doc or some new interviews.  But alas, not so much as a theatrical trailer.  But, LionsGate has split the difference and filled the entire 25GB disc with the picture and audio, which, in the end, is what I was after.  If your a fan of the film and have one its many DVD versions, the upgrade is a must as it blows away the previous releases.

77433,A3DU3WOGW4A9QH,0784012822,"jammer ""jammmer""","[18, 21]","This reviewer considers The Arrival one of the TEN BEST science fiction films ever!My comparisons between the standard (red-ray) Live-Artisan DVD double feature (The Arrival and Arrival II, dual sided single disc); and the blu-ray release are below.  I have never seen the original single-sided red-ray release of just The Arrival (Live-Artisan); or the red-ray two-disc double feature edition of same put out by Lions Gate.  It is possible that either of those two editions have better picture quality than the comparison red-ray release.I used a 1080p LCD (Sony Bravia 32XBR6), a Pioneer (BDP-51FD) Blu-ray Disc player; a Pioneer Elite DVD Player DV-59AVi (top of the line!) for standard red-ray DVDs; and a Sunfire receiver-amp with the largest Klipsch speakers and woofer money could buy.  I have neither the proper equipment, time, nor inclination to make a more scientific analysis.  I can't count speckle density or minute dirt fleck artifacts or other source contaminants.  I can't freeze frame to examine defects.  But I can mount the standard red-ray disc in the Pioneer Elite player, mount the blu-ray disc in the Pioneer Blu-ray player, and then intercut selected scenes of special interest between these two onto a shared Sony 32XBR6.Upon doing this, one thing becomes very clear:  The blu-ray image is VASTLY SUPERIOR in every respect!  By comparison, the red-ray image looks grubby, blurry and truly awful (the price one apparently pays for getting used to blu-ray?)!  And the DTS sound track is spectacular.  If you are a big fan of this film, have blu-ray, can afford the reasonable price, and are debating; then the decision is clear:  Get the blu-ray release for your collection and dispose of the other one!That being said, this blu-ray release is not without problems, likely tracking back to the original filming.  Image quality varies from scene to scene depending on such factors as underground, indoor or outdoor locales; and foreground versus background definition.  The opening scene of the earth from space fading into the giant radio receiver antenna is great!  By comparison, the red-ray image appears grey and drab.  Other shots of Californian or Mexican mountains are good in their faded desert clarity and color definition. Details on close-ups of faces, facial wrinkles and blemishes, strands of hair, sweating from the excessive heat, clothing fabric weaves and patterns, neck-tie details, are exceptionally sharp and up to full blu-ray standards.Blu-ray's superior definition reinforces a key plot-point:  Earthlings are suffering from the sweltering temperatures induced by the alien terra-forming.  Sweat literally rolls off Zane's face.  But the aliens of course (like Gordy) don't sweat; THEY LIKE IT HOT!  On red-ray DVD, picture detail is so poor that such a subtle reinforcement almost escapes notice.Filmed in Technicolor, no grain was visible except where intended.  I've heard they use a newer Technicolor process than that of old, wherein colors are muted and blacks lack good fidelity as is the case here.  Knowing little about photography, the cameras used for the filming obviously had very poor depth of field.  (Some big budget recent films - I Am Legend - display exquisite detail simultaneously in both foreground AND background, NOT true here!)  Why?  Because of computer-generated digital backgrounds?  More sophisticated cameras?  Rear projection techniques?  Use of blue screen?  In this film, camera shots lacking foreground focal points (like faces), where depth of field is not a problem display very pleasing distance detail:  the walls inside and outside of this ""one of our much very best hotels;"" the water trickling down and over the tile floor; many of the panning landscape shots in California and Mexico; images of that giant radio receiver; were all good, some even showing exquisite detail.My biggest criticisms concern the underground scenes which are grey, foggy and indistinct; colors are excessively muted and black saturation fidelity is abominable!  As said in another review somewhere: it's as if an obscuring film was laying over everything.  Two positive notes on these underground scenes:  First, close-up details of Zane's face, that of other aliens, and foreground shots of equipment and the like are crisp, despite the background color fidelity issues, the color for such underground foregrounds being mostly pretty good.  Second, after comparing several key scenes, I saw no instance where the underground special effects weren't at least the equal of, or significantly improved (sometimes much more) over red-ray:  There is more detail in close-up alien shots and in the underground combustion chamber, with better color too.It's pretty hard to compete with big budget computer generated digital backdrops, likely why some recent films with such newer technology come out so well on blu-ray.  Yet this release is a clear step up from what was out before.",3,"This review is of the blu-ray release, not the film!",1242000000,"05 11, 2009",2009,4940,"['reviewer', 'Arrival', 'one', 'TEN',

77447,A1QHYYND7Q7ZOE,0784012822,Justin Lowry,"[2, 3]","""The Arrival"" is one of Hollywood's few attempts to make a real sci-fi film - one that takes a creative idea and plays it out to its conculsion rather than just using sci-fi as window-dressing.  The product is an entralling film that begins slow (as it should) but then ramps up the stakes with some great scenes.  ""The Arrival"" does what it sets out to do and does it well.  It is not overly ambitious and it is unpretentious.One thing that impresses me about the film is that it pays attention to the science.  It doesn't go into details much, but in the background one can see that the writer did his research.  From details such as the knowledge that the transmission is from the stars and not a satellite, to the major creative idea behind the plot (which I will not mention so as not to spoil it).Charlie Sheen does an excellent job as a paranoid astronomer.  His character is dedicated, not afraid to uncover the truth no matter the cost to himself.  The sidekick character Kiki though is distracting.  Kiki is written as if drawing on stereotypes.  Maybe there is subtle reason for that given Kiki's nature, but it's unclear.  I will leave it there.Unfortunately, the DVD release is subpar.  My main concern in a DVD is for high quality in the video and audio.  Alas, this DVD does not use anamorphic video in its widescreen version, which means it does not utilize the full resolution that the format is capable of.  More problematic is that the film print used for the transfer is not very good, though not terrible.  There are a fair number of dust specks and other film artifacts and the colors are washed out in some places.  The audio for the film is decent but not spectacular.  The 5.1 audio shines most in a few crucial scenes.  The DVD also lacks features.  It only includes a couple of trailers.  I would love to see a special edition done with this film.Overall, I give the film a solid 4 stars but the DVD only 2.",4,"Good movie, mediocre DVD",1096848000,"10 4, 2004",2004,1934,"['Arrival', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'few', 'attempts', 'make', 'real', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'one', 'creative', 'idea', 'plays', 'out', 'conculsion', 'rather', 'just', 'using', 'sci-fi', 'window-dressing', 'product', 'entralling', 'film', 'slow', 'should', 'then', 'up', 'stakes', 'great', 'scenes', 'Arrival', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'well', 'not', 'overly', 'ambitious', 'unpretentious.One', 'thing', 'film', 'attention', 'science', ""n't"", 'go', 'details', 'much', 'background', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'writer', 'did', 'research', 'details', 'such', 'knowledge', 'transmission', 'stars', 'not', 'satellite', 'major', 'creative', 'idea', 'plot', 'will', 'not', 'mention', 'so', 'not', 'spoil', '.Charlie', 'Sheen', 'excellent', 'job', 'paranoid', 'astronomer', 'character', 'dedicated', 'not', 'afraid', 'uncover', 'truth', 'matter', 'cost', 'sidekick', 'character', 'Kiki', 'though', 'distracting', 'Kiki', 'written', 'drawing', 'stereotypes', 'Maybe', 'subtle', 'reason', 'given', 'Kiki', 'nature', 'unclear', 'will', 'leave', 'there.Unfortunately', 'DVD', 'release', 'subpar', 'main', 'concern', 'DVD', 'high', 'quality', 'video', 'audio', 'Alas', 'DVD', 'not', 'use', 'anamorphic', 'video', 'widescreen', 'version', 'not', 'utilize', 'full', 'resolution', 'format', 'capable', 'More', 'problematic', 'film', 'print', 'used', 'transfer', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'terrible', 'are', 'fair', 'number', 'dust', 'specks', 'other', 'film', 'artifacts', 'colors', 'are', 'washed', 'out', 'places', 'audio', 'film', 'decent', 'not', 'spectacular', '5.1', 'audio', 'shines', 'most', 'few', 'crucial', 'scenes', 'DVD', 'also', 'features', 'only', 'couple', 'trailers', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'special', 'edition', 'done', 'film.Overall', 'give', 'film', 'solid', '4', 'stars', 'DVD', 'only', '2']",N/A

Burning fossil fuels, spraying aerosol cans, and the destruction of the rain forests have all been accused of being responsible for the melting polar ice caps.  Writer-director David Twohy comes up with a more interesting culprit in this 1996 science fiction thriller, which begins with scientist Ilana Green (Lindsay Crouse) finding something in Antarctica that should not be there.  However, the hero of our tale is a radio astronomer named Zane Zaminski (Charlie Sheen with a goatee), who working on a S.E.T.I. project by looking where nobody in their right mind should be looking, in the FM band.  To his surprise and the shock of his colleague, Cal (Richard Schiff), he finds something there.  This could be the biggest scientific discovery of the 20th century by Zane's boss, Phil Gordian (Ron Silver), not only refuses to get excited, he destroys the evidence.  Then some strange guys in suits show up to make sure they have all of the evidence.Clearly Zane has discovered something he is not supposed to know about.  But part of the problem is that he has no clue what he has stumbled upon or why it should get people killed.  The other key part of the problem is that Zane is now unemployed and no longer has access to a gigantic radio telescope.  So he has to, basically, build one, which is how &quot;The Arrival&quot; lets you know that Twohy has paid attention to the science of the story (okay, I know nothing about science and this could all be nonsense, but there is an effort being made to connect the scientific dots).  Zane effective does build his own radio telescope, and if this new phase of his old obsession has made him lose his girl friend, Char (Teri Polo), at least he has Kiki (Tony T. Johnson) the smart street kid who lives next door to take up the slack.At some point Zane and Ilana have to cross paths, which gets them closer to the horrible truth that still has to see some people dead in this movie.  But we have a big clue in terms of trying to figure out where the interests of a radio astronomer and an environmental scientist would overlap.  Of course the audience gets to figure things out a bit before Zane does, but then he is distracted by the most ingenious attempts to kill someone is  bath tub I have seen since &quot;Final Destination.&quot;  I checked out this film because I saw one of Twohy's more recent efforts, &quot;Below,&quot; and again he shows some creativity in presenting the conventions of the science fiction-thriller genre.Sheen's performance is an interesting mix of paranoia and anger, sometimes switching back and forth between the two in an instance if somebody looks at him funny or is just funny looking.  At a key point in the film he is asked why he knows the bad guys are not gone yet, and his response is the best line in the film.  I did not bite on the obvious red herring as to who the ultimate villain was in &quot;The Arrival,&quot; but I did not see the final revelation coming either, so that is a good thing.  Ultimately, I did not find &quot;The Arrival&quot; to be a classic science fiction film, but for a modern version of the &quot;B&quot; movie it is very good.  There is a sequel, 1998's &quot;The Second Arrival,&quot; but Twohy had nothing to do with it, which is rarely a good since when it comes to such things.",4,Want to know the cause of global warming?

Clever and imaginative, a lot was done on a limited budget to make it into a top notch sci-fi thriller. It has an intelligent and well reasoned story, and the special effects are imaginative.Charlie Sheen, clean and sober, plays radio astronomer, Zane Zaminski, who picks up radio signals that are not earthly. When he takes a copy of the tape of these signals, which he believes to be indicative of intelligent, alien life, to his boss, chillingly played by Ron Silver, he is summarily fired from his job. Suddenly, all is not right with the world.Smelling something real fishy, Zane sets up a home satellite and tries to zero in on the signal. He gets lucky, or unlucky, depending upon how one looks at it, and he picks up the same signal he previously had picked up. It crosses a signal given off by a Mexican radio station, which motivates him to go to Mexico and check it out.While in Mexico, he meets a fellow scientist (Lindsay Crouse), who is there on her own investigation, as she has noted major atmospheric changes, which indicate that global warming is occurring at an alarming rate, almost as if there were a greenhouse effect. Unbeknownst to Zane at the time, her concerns are connected to his.While at a power plant with her, he comes across a doppelganger for his former boss, which sets off alarms in his head. Returning undercover at night, he discovers that the entire plant is operated by aliens, and they are not here just to say hello. There, a series of events transpire to reveal to him an immense, alien plot. Yes, it's the old alien conspiracy story rearing its ugly head. Only this time, it is handled with surprising intelligence. Zane is now on a mission to convey what he knows to the world, but the aliens will stop at nothing to silence him. Will he make it?

I just caught wind of this movie not too long ago, and wanted to see it, since I haven't seen it at the time. I just happened to watch it last night.Since I have a huge collection of sco-fi movies that date back to the early '50s, I thought well, one more sci-fi film wouldn't hurt. I find this film to be reminiscent of the old '50s classic Invation of the Body Snatchers as well as both '70s films Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Polderguiest where aliens decend on earth to try to take over the population and disguise themselves as normal human beings!WHAT IS THE STORY LINE?The story line begins with Charlie Sheen (from the TV sitom Two and a Half Men) playing radio astronmer Zane Zaminsky who has a ton of radio / satelite equipment and believes that he's picked up cosmic noises that signal the possibility of extra terrestrial intelligence. He investigates further to make sure that his findings are accurate.He then turns the tape over to his boss Phil Gordian (played by Ron Silver) who then fires him. He demands it back, but he doesn't get it back. His girlfriend (Teri Polo) gets transfered and his partner is found dead from a supposed suicide. And after being denied access to the labratory grounds, Zane breaks through the securiy cofinements of the place with his truck anyway to try to do some investigating of his own. After finding out what he wants to know, he heads back to the house to do some more reseach. Strange noises coming from his window has him suspecting that he's being watched. He is startled by someone making a little noise outside! It's Kiki who has been spying on him!Enter Kiki; an Afro-American street-wise smart-mouth 13-year-old boy who is making smirky remarks and lives next door (played by Tony T. Johnson, who also was the nosey getting-into-everyone's- business, asking-nosey- questions smart-mouthed smirky-comment-spewing little boy Chris who lives next door to Deacon Earnest Frye in the TV sitcom Amen). After being told by Zane to wait downstairs, Kiki somehow sneaks upstairs to the lab room and  wants to know what's going on and why Zane is so wrapped up in his research on the possibility that aliens may be invading Earth. So when Kiki bombards Zane with a mountain of questions, Zane has no choice but to let the always nosey and curious but crazy and friendly Kiki work with him for a while because he was afraid that Kiki might blow his cover.Zane's desparate search for answers leads him to Mexico and into a mysterious power plant, generating more than just electricity and is run by people who are not what they appear to be. He then gets arrested for the murder of a scientist (Lindsay Crouse) while investigating an impending ecological disaster.Back at home, Zane finds out that his lab room in the attic has been mysteriously robbed of his equipment and happens to see Kiki again. He and his female assistant goes back over to the huge satelite dish with Kiki in tow behind them.Zane learns the sad truth about Kiki having become an alien when Kiki stares at him mysteriously,then he stops trying to help him and gives the tape to Phil instead.When they are attacked by the people disguised as aliens, the lab there begins to self-destruct and the giant satelite dish begins to callapse seemingly with Zane and his assistant trying to run for their lives!There's a shot of Kiki from behind standing outside watching. As they manage to escape the collapsing satelite dish, they notice Kiki staring at then again. Angered and disappointed because Kiki turned his back on him on him, Zane gives him a message to take back to the other aliens. Kiki then bends his knees and hips backward (into his alien configuration) and then he runs off into the surrounding dessert.Can they save earth from being taken over by these hostile alians? Who will rise and who will fall? Who's mind will be poison and taken over by the aliens?Tony T. Johnson adds a bit of eccentric humor and comedy to the movie with his street-smart talking and smirky remarks. Just about ALL of his roles in TV and films has him making sarcastic smirky remarks and belittling,treating adults as though he's more superior to them than they are!!Not particularly fond of the ending though.

B Cole ""Kegrun""","[0, 0]","Zane Zaminsky (Charlie Sheen), an astronomer, is at work one day scanning the solar system with his co-worker and friend Calvin (Richard Schiff) when they come across an unidentified signal that is being sent to Earth, not from Earth. Excited that they might have come across extraterrestrial contact, they rush to their boss, who quickly fires Zane because they are 'downsizing' and cutting back employees. Baffled because he's considered one of the best in his field, begins to think something is just not right. So he creates his own scanner in his back yard garage, and comes across the same frequency again one night, but this time it's being sent from Earth, not from outer space. With a little research he finds out that the signal was sent from Mexico, and with that information, he quickly makes his way there to investigate. What he finds though is not quite what he was expecting. Now that paranoia from what's he's witnessed has set in, there is no one that he can trust. Alone, he must get enough evidence to expose the truth to what is going on, before it's to late for the human race.The story of 'The Arrival' is what really drives this movie. The conspiracies, the paranoia, the subtle evil plan. When I saw this in theaters, I remember everything being just right. But now, some 12 years later, not everything is perfect like I remember. What really brings the movie down for me is the action scenes. Most of them just seem so corny. And the CG just isn't as good as say 'Independence Day' which was released around the same time. I wish the movie had been extremely more of a story driven drama than an action/sci-fi. Even Charlie Sheen was pretty good and believable as an astronomer. I loved when he just walked into a conference looking for his boss after he found out a lot of information going on. The man looked like he had been to hell and back.In the end, if you can deal with some hokey action, then this is a definite watch if you like a good 'alien' story. I almost want to give it 4 stars, but just cant because of the goofy action scenes.P.S. Right at the beginning of the movie you see a scene where maybe a football field size of grass was growing... at the North Pole. My friend said that that couldn't happen since the North Pole is nothing but water and ice. There is no actual soil there. Is this true?

I don't want to write a ""spoiler"" type of review, so I will keep things general.In ""Arrival"" with Charlie Sheen, you get a look at someone driven to distraction partly from paranoia and partly from learning the truth. I thought the movie did a great job revealing the storyline at the proper pace - without dragging or rushing.  The movie also did a good job at keeping me guessing who were the ""good guys"" and who were the ""bad guys"" - with some unanticipated surprises along the way.  Also, I liked the progress of Zane's (Charlie Sheen's) urgency throughout.  My main complaint is that there are no special features with ""Arrival.""I thought ""Arrival II"" was a decent sequel.  In the first movie there is a question that takes the full movie to be answered. But we begin the sequel already knowing the answer to the first movie's question, so the tone of the sequel is different. I thought Patrick Muldoon was OK, but for continuity's sake, I wish it could have been Charlie Sheen.  My main complaint with the sequel is that, considering all of the technology available to the ""bad guys"" (who were aliens, governments and federal and local government agencies), much too much time was spent in simple one-on-one car chases with only the same two ""bad guys"" constantly in pursuit.

The story-line is solid, believable, makes sense, and what you might expect IF the events actually were true, and well told.If you have interests in 'global warming', this'll ring a bell... even though, the cause is fiction (we think) ; )  ... the dialog totally works... the characters all work, and work well together. There are some places for 'comic relief', which all totally fit, without over-doing it. And the pace of the film is just right... not too slow, not too fast. I'll say this... just about the time you first wonder when the sci-fi part is gonna start, it's starts... and how! The music seems to fit perfectly... I especially liked the little Myan flute/vibe piece when Zane is first in his yellow jeep rental, down in Mexico. Short... but it sets the 'feel'.This film has some elements of a 'who done it', where the viewer is given a series of clues... but no matter how good you think you are, you absolutely will not figure out what's next. It also has what initially looks like a bit of a 'conspiracy theory' happening... and as the film progresses, you begin to realize just how massive and deep-rooted it actually is. The ending... or what you think is the ending, is a surprise, and goes right back to the conspiracy... and how good these aliens actually are.The locations/scenes/sets/models are excellent, and a complete fit... flawless and quite impressive, especially beneath the power-plant. The distant scene of the power plant in central Mexico looks completely real... right down to the condors slowly soaring on the currents above it.If you're like me, you really hate it when movies or TV shows don't bother with 'continuity' or double-checking facts. The film's second scene introduces the primary character (Charlie Sheen), who is a radio astronomer. Sheen does a top-notch job of acting... totally authentic and believable... and the astronomical references are right on target.IMO, David Twohy did a fantastic job of directing. Supporting actors, Lindsay Crouse, Ron Silver, Leon Rippy, and really everyone... all contribute quite well. How this film snuck past me at the box office, I'll never know. But if you are a true Sci-Fi buff, you'll want this one in your collection... it's a film you can pull out when you have friends over, and probably none of them have ever heard of it... but they won't be disappointed (and neither will you). This is one that you could 'risk' showing to friends, without having seen it first, all will enjoy it, and you won't end up with egg on your face. It's not too heavy in the gore-N-guts department... really nothing excessively violent, so kids can probably watch. There's only one brief 'buff scene'... but it doesn't really show much. Probably more than anything else... I'd say several scenes will inspire 'awe'... like jaw-dropping wOw!Now- when I pruchased my DVD, I was surprised to find that it was actually a two-sided DVD, with ""The Arrival II"" on side 2 (although, I wouldn't expect it, unless it actually says you get both I & II).""The Arrival II"" was initially disappointing for me... as no one from the first film are in the second. The script is weaker... the acting doesn't seem to work as well, and the plot just doesn't go where you'd think it would logically go. It's almost as if some Hollywood executive woke up in the middle of the night, and said ""I got it... we'll do 'The Arrival II', and that'll be way-kewel"". But, you get the impression that no one from the first film wanted anything to do with the project. (kinda makes ya wonder).But- that's not to say it's a bad, or poor film. It does help if you've seen the first one, prior. But it's like the graveyard-shift punched-in, picked-up the ball, and carried it off (and that's all that is really familiar about the film... the alien's ball*). (* As seen in the first film, this is a metal sphere, larger than a softball, but smaller than a basketball... the aliens use it to literally 'wipe a room completely clean'... of everything in the room, and sometimes beyond the room. When activated, it lifts up of the ground, pausing motionless momentarily, then one section slides open emitting light... the sphere begins to spin... a second section opens... then a third. As it's speed increases, it's like it is pulling objects and matter with gravity, and just like in a black-hole, everything revolves around the 'event horizon' until ultimately, it is all pulled into the balck-hole. The same thing happens here, except on a highly localized scale. Finally, the sphere sucks itself out of existance, leaving the room it was placed in completely bare.) The alien sphere's are used twice in ""The Arrival (I)""... one of them completely destroys a huge radio-dish in the desert (great effect, too!... you can even see the wind and dust being drawn into the building)(very realistic).So- I guess my bottom line is... for sure... buy ""The Arrival"". If ""The Arrival II"" happens to be on the other side... great. But I wouldn't buy the ""Arrival II"" on it's own merrit. It's better than most of 'made by the sci-fi channel' for TV movies... but is like weak tea compared to the first Arrival.",5,"""Arrival"" of a top-notch Sci-Fi flick",1197504000,"12 13,

Except the movie has an unusual premise:  Perhaps the global warming being experienced on Earth is terraforming for the advancement of an ""extra solar"" race that wants the Earth as a new home, much like we want to do to Mars.Charlie plays Zaminski, and his life turns for the worst when he listens in on a signal from the Wolf star that he was never meant to intercept.The aliens already on the planet want to cover this up so they fire the guy!  This immediately gets Zaminski's curiosity up and he starts hunting for clues.  This was pretty stupid since if the aliens were really that smart, they would not have been killing off people that knew the secret, but they should have simply pretended to further research the signal and make nothing of it.But then, it would have been a very short movie!Also I wondered where Zaminski got all the money to hack into other radio dishes to further find out the signal and record it.  And when he goes to Mexico and other areas to search for the source of global warming, where does he get all this money for equipment, airfare and hotel?  Amazing for an astrophysicist.He meets a woman whom we as viewers discovered early in the film, another scientist.  The plot runs rather thin with her.  Scorpions are planted in her room by the score and she never sees one of them until too late?  It was beyond ludicrous.What I liked:What I liked were the special effects, the way the aliens made themselves interact with humans flawlessly, and the language and movements were fun.  The whole conspiracy theory stuff and the surprise alien were also fun to see.Bottom Line:Not the best sci fi film I've seen since Zaminski and the aliens both were acting way beyond logic to handle their respective problems.

Shortly after he discovers what seems like a likely signal, and reports it to his boss, he is fired, and blackballed from  academia. He finds a clever and plausible way to continue his research, and  confirms his findings. Soon after, he finds that someone is trying to cover  up his discovery. He finds another scientist who is on to the secret he has  started investigating, and they head to Mexico to investigate  further.Everything the humans in the movie do is plausible. The human  science is sound, and even clever in the case of how Charlie Sheen  continues his radio astronomy. The behavior is reasonable too -- people  show fear when we would be afraid, and make mistakes that seem reasonable  rather than stupid. When they discover useful information, they draw clever  conclusions, without relying on unbelievable reasoning or information they  couldn't know. Charlie Sheen has a few successes -- and failures -- due to  luck, but most of his success come from dedication and intelligence.The  aliens are generally plausible too. Some of their technology is a bit hard  to believe, but don't require unreasonable suspension of disbelief. (Their  disguises are questionable, but important to the plot and more believeable  than alternatives in other movies. The device they used to shut down  Charlie Sheen's follow-up experiments was questionable, but more fun to see  in action than a work gang.) More important, the aliens' behavior is  reasonable. They're very protective of their secrets, which they would have  to be to maintain their cover. Rather than mistakes of overconfidence,  their mistakes result from desire to keep a low profile...It has a bad  direct-to-video sequel, which is present as a mostly worthless extra on one  DVD version of The Arrival.

Dead-on realistic with uniformly excellent performances, including top-billed Charlie Sheen (I never would have guessed from movies like ""Hot Shots"" and ""Major League"" that he'd be so capable of doing this kind of role so excellently) and Ron Silver, outstanding special effects and true conceptual innovation, I would have to rank this as one of the best science fiction movies ever.Two radio astronomers involved with the ongoing globally co-ordinated scanning of the skies for radio waves that could be of artificial origin (alien transmissions) suddenly hit the jackpot when on one random night, 'The' transmission gets picked up.  What should be the discovery of a lifetime becomes a maddening frustration as they're disbelieved and suppressed, and a nightmare as more drastic action is taken and the movie begins to reveal the stunning iceberg that the initial, undeciphered transmission was just the merest tip of.

77525,A2VP7JOT3K7PFM,0784012822,"Stephen Pletko ""Uncle Stevie""","[7, 9]","+++++This disc is a DVD double feature having one movie on each side.(1) The Arrival (5 stars)Radio Astronomer Zane Zaminsky (Charlie Sheen) believes he's picked up a cosmic noise that signals ET.  Trouble is his boss Phil Gordian (Ron Silver) doesn't believe him.  So Zane tries to reestablish contact, which he does but this time the extraterrestrial signal is Earth-based.  At the same time, an UCLA environmentalist Ilana Green (Lindsay Crouse) discovers from her data that the global average temperature is predicted to rise an unprecedented dozen degrees over the next decade.For both Zane and Ilana, the search for answers leads them to Mexico where Zane discovers a mysterious and secretive power plant that's operated by ETs.  Through misunderstanding, he's also arrested for the murder of Ilana.  Zane must escape with his proof of an alien invasion.The second half of this movie is truly fascinating.  The special effects (considering that this movie was shot on a limited budget) are effective and ""smart.""  These special effects do not get in the way of the excellent acting of Charlie Sheen and Ron Silver (who gives an especially chilling performance).Some of the scientific topics discussed in this movie are:greenhouse gases, ET intelligence, radio astronomy, global warming, terraforming, and space aliens.The DVD extra of this movie gives a good summary of this movie:""A [ET] signal never meant to be heard,A secret never meant to be shared,A scientist never meant to survive.""I was absorbed in this story from beginning to end.(2) Arrival II (3 stars-I'm being generous here)After an exhilarating first movie, I was truly disappointed in this sequel.We're told that Zane has died but before doing so he has sent information packets about ""an alien conspiracy"" to five people.  Three of the most important ones are his stepbrother, computer programmer Jack (Pat Muldoon), an investigative reporter Bridget (Jane Sibbet), and a professor named Nelson Zarcoff (Michael Sarrrazin).  (No one from the first movie appears in this sequel.)The aliens know that Zane has sent these information packets to these people. (Question: how would they know?)  The movie then becomes one long chase scene with the aliens having trouble getting to Jack and Bridget.This movie goes for shock value.  There is an unnecessary full-frontal nude scene and decent special effects.  (I decided to give this movie a 3 instead of a 2 because of these decent special effects.)There's only one true extra with this movie: a theatrical trailer.While the first movie kept me absorbed in the story, this one did not.Finally, the DVD as a whole has practically perfect picture and sound quality.In conclusion,  ""The Arrival"" is an effective, intelligent science fiction movie that unfortunately gave birth to a disappointing sequel.(1996/1998;  110 min/100 min;  widescreen; 40 scenes/36 scenes)+++++",4,"""If you can't tend to your own planet, [then] you don't deserve to live here""",1125964800,"09 6, 2005",2005,2887,"['+++++This', 'disc', 'DVD', 'double', 'feature', 'having', 'one', 'movie', 'side', '1', 'Arrival', '5', 'stars', 'Radio', 'Astronomer', 'Zane', 'Zaminsky', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'picked', 'up', 'cosmic', 'noise', 'ET', 'Trouble', 'boss', 'Phil', 'Gordian', 'Ron', 'Silver', ""n't"", 'believe', 'So', 'Zane', 'tries', 'reestablish', 'contact', 'time', 'extraterrestrial', 'signal', 'Earth-based', 'same', 'time', 'UCLA', 'environmentalist', 'Ilana', 'Green', 'Lindsay', 'Crouse', 'discovers', 'data', 'global', 'average', 'temperature', 'predicted', 'rise', 'unprecedented', 'dozen', 'degrees', 'next', 'decade.For', 'Zane', 'Ilana', 'search', 'answers', 'Mexico', 'where', 'Zane', 'mysterious', 'secretive', 'power', 'plant', 'operated', 'ETs', 'misunderstanding', 'also', 'arrested', 'murder', 'Ilana', 'Zane', 'must', 'escape', 'proof', 'alien', 'invasion.The', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'truly', 'fascinating', 'special', 'effects', 'considering', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'limited', 'budget', 'are', 'effective', 'smart', 'special', 'effects', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'way', 'excellent', 'acting', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'who', 'especially', 'chilling', 'performance', '.Some', 'scientific', 'topics', 'discussed', 'movie', 'are', 'greenhouse', 'gases', 'ET', 'intelligence', 'radio', 'astronomy', 'global', 'warming', 'terraforming', 'space', 'aliens.The', 'DVD', 'extra', 'movie', 'good', 'summary', 'movie', '[', 'ET', ']', 'signal', 'never', 'meant', 'be', 'heard', 'secret', 'never', 'meant', 'be', 'shared', 'scientist', 'never', 'meant', 'survive', 'was', 'absorbed', 'story', 'beginning', 'end', '2', 'Arrival', 'II', '3', 'stars-I', ""'m"", 'being', 'generous', 'here', 'exhilarating', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'truly', 'disappointed', 'sequel.We', ""'re"", 'told', 'Zane', 'died', 'doing', 'so', 'sent', 'information', 'packets', 'alien', 'conspiracy', 'five', 'people', 'Three', 'most', 'important', 'ones', 'are', 'stepbrother', 'computer', 'programmer', 'Jack', 'Pat', 'Muldoon', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'Bridget', 'Jane', 'Sibbet', 'professor', 'named', 'Nelson', 'Zarcoff', 'Michael', 'Sarrrazin', 'one', 'first', 'movie', 'sequel', 'aliens', 'know', 'Zane', 'sent', 'information', 'packets', 'people', 'Question', 'how', 'would', 'know', 'movie', 'then', 'one', 'long', 'chase', 'scene', 'aliens', 'having', 'trouble', 'getting', 'Jack', 'Bridget.This', 'movie', 'shock', 'value', 'unnecessary', 'full-frontal', 'nude', 'scene', 'decent', 'special', 'effects', 'decided', 'give', 'movie', '3', 'instead', '2', 'decent', 'special', 'effects', 'only', 'one', 'true', 'extra', 'movie', 'theatrical', 'trailer.While', 'first', 'movie', 'kept', 'absorbed', 'story', 'one', 'did', 'not.Finally', 'DVD', 'whole', 'practically', 'perfect', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality.In', 'conclusion', 'Arrival', 'effective', 'intelligent', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'gave', 'birth', 'disappointing', 'sequel', '1996/1998', '110', 'min/100', 'min', '40', 'scenes/36', 'scenes', '+++++']",N/A

77541,A2XOS0D485JSMM,0784012822,webhawk50,"[0, 0]","Okay.  I've pretty much given away the movie with my tag line.  It is in the way this particular genre of &#34;the aliens have landed and are among us&#34; unfolds that kept me riveted to the movie. Charlie Sheen often plays the roles of out-of-control characters that border on the psychotic quite well.  He is positively unrelenting and manic in this regard here.I found The Arrival a very enjoyable and quite different kind of sci-flick.  This is not the first time that the aliens have infiltrated our society in the manner depicted in this movie.  We could even go back to the pod people of &#34;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&#34; or the wonderful B-movie, &#34;They Live&#34;.  The Arrival fits nicely into those camps, but is far more intelligent in the way the main character (Sheen) goes about unraveling the mystery.  It is ingenious, really, if not considerably absurd, in spite of the fact that it might even be actually &#34;doable&#34;.  I am being purposefully vague here, because I don't want to give away too many details about how our hero goes about unlocking the secrets of the particular problem he discovers after finding a spike on the FM band that he obsessively scans the skies for.  The Arrival is generally pretty logically solid (okay, it's not perfect, but hey, we're talking sci-fi here) and what I liked most is that we're kept guessing and intrigued right up to the end.  I've usually got things figured out in these kinds of movies almost from the get-go, but this movie has enough twists and turns and unexpected discoveries and events that I was kept thoroughly intrigued throughout the movie.While I can't go so far as to say that I &#34;loved&#34; this movie, I really liked it and would watch it many times.

And the supporting cast doesn't do much for it either.Just a bland sci-fi movie that I really could have just skipped. I can't really even recommend renting it.
