What momma doesn't know can't hurt her.The Howling III starts off pretty good. Cheesey special effects (none of that CG crud) , quirky characters, and good looking women. Typical 80's horror with the exception of it being filmed in Australia.Basically a band of marsupial werewolves live in the outback to avoid man's encroachment and scientists that may want to do experiments on them. After all, they are werewolves with pouches, that's fairly rare these days.The first half of the movie had plenty of good old fashioned special effects and entertaining sequences that kept both my daughter and I interested. Of course it was a bit uncomfortable when the lead female (Kanga-lycanthrope) gives birth to a little marsupial werewolf baby. Ugly little bugger at that!The second half of the flick just doesn't have enough special effect type sequences to keep it interesting.You may think the storyline has enough clout to stand on it's own but it doesn't.Still I'm happy to add it to my collection of 80's horror films.The DVD is of good quality.(widescreen) and it does contain several extras which is rare for a film of this type and price.Good day mate!!",3,The Howling 3 gets a generous 3 stars................,1071619200,"12 17, 2003",2003,1385,"['moment', 'Christmas', 'spirit', 'overload', 'pick', 'up', 'two', 'copies', 'movie', 'One', 'office', 'party', 'one', 'myself.I', 'get', 'home', 'see', 'PG-13', 'figure', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'daughter', 'spousal', 'unit', 'asleep', 'What', 'momma', ""n't"", 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'her.The', 'Howling', 'III', 'pretty', 'good', 'Cheesey', 'special', 'effects', 'none', 'CG', 'crud', 'quirky', 'characters', 'good', 'looking', 'women', 'Typical', '80', 'horror', 'exception', 'being', 'filmed', 'Australia.Basically', 'band', 'marsupial', 'werewolves', 'live', 'outback', 'avoid', 'man', 'encroachment', 'scientists', 'may', 'want', 'do', 'experiments', 'are', 'werewolves', 'pouches', 'fairly', 'rare', 'days.The', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'had', 'plenty', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'special', 'effects', 'entertaining', 'sequences', 'kept', 'daughter', 'interested', 'course', 'was', 'bit', 'uncomfortable', 'when', 'lead', 'female', 'Kanga-lycanthrope', 'birth', 'little', 'marsupial', 'werewolf', 'baby', 'Ugly', 'little', 'bugger', 'second', 'half', 'flick', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'special', 'effect', 'type', 'sequences', 'keep', 'interesting.You', 'may', 'think', 'storyline', 'enough', 'clout', 'stand', 'own', ""'m"", 'happy', 'add', 'collection', '80', 'horror', 'films.The', 'DVD', 'good', 'quality', 'widescreen', 'contain', 'several', 'extras', 'rare', 'film', 'type', 'price.Good', 'day', 'mate']",N/A

I had no idea what to expect from Howling III. In the first part of the movie, it seems like a funny horror-comedy, even a spoof of other werewolf movies.

That's really the only thing that grossed me out.

Although it is understandably assumed that ""wolfman"" is describing some kind of Soviet project or weapon, the news is nonetheless brought to the attention of a professor in sociology, who packs his bags for... Australia (?)... to find conclusive evidence of werewolves. Yes, yes, Prof. Beckmeyer's grandfather had old footage of a supposed wolfman captured by natives in 1905 in Cape York, but it still feels like our ""hero"" used the KGB info to somehow validate going down under instead. And yes, they're still down under, as indicated by Imogen Annesley leaving her clan, only to be followed by three werewolves disguised as nuns (!) and tracked down. Not before, however, getting a role in the film production of ""Shape Shifters Part 8"", falling in love and getting pregnant. In that order, of course. The film's title, at least, is not misleading as Imogen's pouch is put to proper use later on.

Considering this to be concrete evidence of the existence of werewolves, Harry travels to Australia so that he can prove the existence of werewolves to the scientific community.Meanwhile Australian native Jerboa (Imogen Annesley) is recruited by a young filmmaker (Donny) to act in a werewolf movie called ""Shape Shifters.""  They become intimate and Donny learns a bit more than he expected about werewolves--including that, evidently, they have kangaroo pouches just above their hoo-has.The first half of the movie follows these three characters in an over-the-top marathon of fun horror-spoofed nonsense.  The second half feels like a really weird family movie complete with a healthy relationships between Jerboa and Donny, Harry settling down with a balerina werewolf, and they all have fast-growing werechildren.  Meanwhile, the Australian military has become hell-bent on capturing, studying and maybe eradicating the recently discovered werewolves.  It's like The Little Marsupial Werewolf House on the Prairie with some pesky military occupants.The cheesy transformation scenes are comically littered with rubber prosthetics, bubbling skin and retractable claws.  There's a laughably gross monster birth scene dream sequence.  Oh, and there are werewolf nuns and a werewolf ballerina with poor transformation timing!  Of course, the actual action is infrequent and awful, but I don't mind at all.Fun, weird, light-hearted and spoofy.  All in good fun, folks.MPAA SIDEBAR:  As for the rating, you should really consider this to be rated R (not PG-13) when considering young viewers.  It's not scary or gory, but there's basically total nudity obscured only by a thin layer of ""body fur"" and this includes the moment and the actual act of monster childbirth followed by watching a tiny, slimy, marsupial lycanthrope--which is strangely cute--make its way to mommy's pouch from her...well, you know.

Director Philip Mora must have had his tongue firmly stuck in his cheek when he wrote and directed this film. It's about Marsupial werewolfs for goodness sake! It you take it for what it is, Howling III is entertaining for the first half. It's so odd that it keeps you interested. The last half tends to drag, and seems to overstay its welcome. This DVD is beautifully remastered, in widescreen, and comes with plenty of extras. I can't believe this movie was treated so well on its DVD release when it's not even liked that well by horror movie fans? It just strikes me as strange. Anyway, I have to say I liked the Director's communtary by Philip Mora. He seems to take this movie so seriously, saying that he ""wanted to make a Howling movie he could call his own since Howling II (which he also directed) was the product of the editors and producers"". I can't say that Howling III is much better than Howling II. Both are pretty lame in my book. Anyway, I like these wacked out horror movies every once-in-awhile. Make sure to also pick up the MGM's new special edition of The Howling and the Artisan double feature Howling V/Howling VI DVD to help complete your oddball werewolf collection.

Starting with the original 1981 film, we got a classic genre film and one of the best werewolf films ever made.  After it's success at the box office came ""Howling II"" a few years later.  A low budget, low class sequel....  Over the course of the 80's and early 90's followed more Howling sequels.  With seven films in total, the quality (""Howling 7:  New Moon Rising"" is the only one that's UNWATCHABLE) varies quite a bit, but it really goes without saying that thanks to a great script, some outrageous moments and effects and a good cast, ""Howling III-The Marsupials"" is quite a fun ride.  There's nothing too scary going on here, but this film provides some amazing weird moments, some darkly twisted touches and an overall sense of fun that for the horror/werewolf fan, it's real hard to dislike this film.Having nothing to do with the previous films other than the fact that part III also involves werewolves, the story centers around the existance of and subsequent hunt for a tribe of marsupial werewolves.  Descended from the extinct Tasmanian Tiger, the tribe of marsupials have remained a secret until one of their own escapes to America and becomes a popular B Movie actress.  Before long, other members of the tribe are sent to bring her back, attention is called to the tribe when she becomes famous and eventally, the marsupial tribe is being hunted through the outback by the military while a small band of humans race to protect them.  Toss into the mix, werewolf nuns, a Russian werewolf ballerina, a 'Hitchcockian' B movie director and some other truly odd moments and you have a werewolf film unlike any other!There's a surprising amount of character depth here that really engages the viewer.  You'll be engorssed in the love story that ignites between the refugee werewolf and the film producer, when they return to the outback to protect her tribe from the military, the viewer is generally rooting for the good guys to win the day.  ""Howling III"" is a real crazy film, chaulk full of strange ideas, likable characters and some nice fx work.  Don't let the PG-13 rating turn you off, it's not as tame as you'd think and it's so much fun that it doesn't matter what it's rated.

580647,A30SEFSHDK5RX,B00005B8U3,Matthew C. Lupoli,"[10, 12]","PLOT: The film opens with archival footage labeled as ""Cape York, Australia, 1905."" A group of Aborigines are posing with a dead werewolf that is tied to a tree. The film then jumps to modern day. The U.S. government intercepts a KGB report of a werewolf killing three villagers in a small Siberian village and that a special army has been dispatched to take care of the beast. Some think that the Soviets are using the word ""werewolf"" as a code name. Others think that it is the real thing. Next, the film introduces us to Professor Harry Beckmeyer (Barry Otto), an anthropologist. He shows his class the archival footage from the beginning of the film. The footage was made by his grandfather on an anthropological expedition of the Australian outback. He never returned but this was the footage that was found. The Aborigines are shown dancing around the werewolf tied to a tree. Then they throw spears at it and kill it. Harry says that the werewolf is a woman wearing an unbelievably lifelike wolf-mask, but he secretly believes that it is a real werewolf. The U.S. government later summons Harry and informs him about the KGB reports. He admits that he thinks that werewolves really exist and that they live in places like Russia and Australia. Harry goes back to Sydney, Australia and meets up with his colleague Professor Sharp (Ralph Cotterill). He tells Sharp about his plans to get evidence of the existence of werewolves. The film next takes us to a small outback village outside of Sydney named Flow (that's Wolf spelled backwards.) A beautiful young werewolf woman there named Jerboa (Imogen Annesley) is being mistreated by her stepfather (and den leader) Thylo (Max Fairchild). She hits him and runs off. She charters a bus to Sydney. A priest on board asks her why she is running away. She simply replies, ""Because my stepfather tried to rape me and he's a werewolf."" After arriving in Sydney, Jerboa spends the night on a park bench. Two drunken Australians start harassing her. She quickly starts sprouting fangs and green werewolf eyes and scares them away. The next morning, Jerboa awakens to see the beauty that is Sydney. A young man driving by (Leigh Biolos) sees Jerboa on the park bench and falls in love with her at first sight. He parks his car and starts to approach her. Jerboa, fearing the man might want to hurt her, runs off. The man chases her to a dead end and quickly proclaims that he is not trying to hurt her but that he wants to offer her a job. He says that his name is Donny and that he is the assistant director on a horror film called ""Shape Shifters Part 8."" He says that she is perfect for the female part because she is ""beautiful and wild-looking."" He tells her that she won't get much money, being that it is a low-budget film, but she agrees to take the part anyway. It turns out that Donny gets a lot more than he bargained for.COMMENTS: This is the first Howling sequel that has nothing to do with the original, or any of the other films for that matter. It was also the last one to be released theatrically. Philippe Mora, who directed Howling II, also directed this film. He felt that the producers and editors ruined Howling II, so he made sure that no one got in the way of this one. The story and screenplay were written by Mora himself. He cites Gary Brandner's novel ""The Howling III: Echoes"" (1985) as the source material, but it is an extremely unfaithful adaptation. The novel takes place in the same village from the original Howling. I've got to give Mora an A+ for originality here. He's an Australian so he thought it would be cool to have a movie about Australian werewolves which descended from the thylacine (Tasmanian wolf), a marsupial predator that carried its young in a pouch. I think that this was a great idea and it makes the film stand out as one of the better Howling sequels. Mora shows that the werewolves are people like anybody else and he makes the audience feel sorry for them. It is also the only Howling film to get a PG-13 rating. Mora intended for this film to not be very gory and be sort of a ""tongue-in-pouch"" horror comedy. In many ways it is a spoof of the first two films. The makeup and special effects are a big improvement over Howling II, though they still don't match up with Rob Bottin's makeup and special effects from the original Howling. The werewolves in this film resemble the original Howling werewolves a lot more than the ones in Howling II. A contradictory problem with this film is that some of the werewolves seem to be killed when shot by regular bullets, as opposed to silver ones. If there is one thing that the Howling series introduced us to, it is sexy female werewolves (i.e. Elisabeth Brooks, Marsha A. Hunt, Sybil Danning) and Imogen Annesley as Jerboa is no exception. The franchise also introduced us to ""werewolf sex scenes"", which is replaced in this film by a ""werewolf birth scene"". I would recommend this film to most horror fans and all werewolf fans. This new DVD version is pretty nice. The picture and sound have been completely remastered and it is presented in the original widescreen theatrical ratio. It also features a photo gallery, original promotional trailer, TV spot, and an interesting commentary by Philippe Mora. He mentions how the film within the film is called ""Shape Shifters Part 8"" and how the Howling franchise ironically made it up to Part 7.

It goes wrong just as badly, but for completely different reasons. Who could have messed up these movies so badly?Jerboa, the main female of the flick (also a werewolf of course) escapes her 'clan' to avoid another werewolf's (Thylo's) sexual nudgings. She winds up in a park, found by Donny, who falls for her immediately and casts her in his cheesy horror flick. After the two do the sweaty dance in bed, Jerboa begins changing one night at a party because of the effects from strobe lights. (!?) Panicking, she runs into a car and is hauled to a hospital. There the doctors notice she's not normal (No kidding), and of course know instantly to call in Beck Meyer, who happens to be someone who has been searching for 'real werewolves' for years now.A few of Jerboa's clan members, not holding a grudge, come to rescue her in the hospital. In order to do this, their attire makes them appear as nuns. (!) ... And ugly ones at that. After her break out, Jerboa runs back to the tribe, knowing she doesn't belong alone in the big, bad world , to where she gives birth to one of the oddest things imaginable. The 'infant' sleeps and sits in her pouch (WTF???). Of course, love is so blind it can cause stupidity, especially in horror films, so the boyfriend runs back to her, knows the truth, yet almost instantaneously accepts her and his freak child. Sorry, folks, I'm a good person and all, but I think I'd have major problems adjusting.Because of the Dr's annoying meddling, a U.S. task force arrives to try and capture the clan. The werewolves flee, and then the film jumps to seeing Jerboa's and Danny's older son grown, as well as the natural progression of the clan.There are plenty of reasons Howling 3 failed, the most obvious one being the ridiculous concept of WERE KANGAROOS. However, even the oddest of things can work decently if they are executed correctly, and this one really wasn't. It doesn't help that on the movie they make fun of what they're doing on camera as well , yet play the whole movie out like they want it to be taken seriously. The pacing was all off, for one thing. They tried to fit too much story into one movie (Never thought I'd say that concerning one of these sequels). What I mean is, one minute she's escaping, then she instantly falls in love, gives birth, a minute later the son is full grown....everything is rush, rush, rush, and because of this nothing is ever explored to seem real. Not that this is a big loss with this flick, but still....The low budget also seeped through in cheesy effects, stale acting, and a botched script. It's set in Australia, and that is a cool move that's bizarre since that's also where Kangaroos reside.

580655,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B00005B8U3,Robert I. Hedges,"[1, 2]","""Howling III"" is not really related to the earlier ""Howling"" entries, though it manages to create howls of an entirely different type. The film opens in Australia in 1905 with villagers taunting a half-man, half-bear creature, but before you can figure out what is going on or even whether or not the creature has a pouch and eats eucalyptus leaves, the film snaps your neck in a jump cut to a man screaming at the top of his lungs in Siberia. That's about thirty seconds into the film, and if you know what's good for you, you'll stop right there.In a matter of national security, US intelligence picks up evidence of werewolves marauding in the Soviet Union (this was, after all, made before the Berlin Wall fell.) My question: what kind of apparatus does the US have for monitoring worldwide werewolf activity: I was skeptical. Speaking of skeptical, the President was also skeptical, but we were both wrong, as it turns out. It turns out that there is an unemployed actress who is also a werewolf marsupial named Jerboa Jerboa (Imogen Annesley.) I really can't tell you what happens for about the next twenty minutes of the movie, because I was laughing way too hard at that name to concentrate for quite a while. Jerboa gets involved with a human, they breed, and the creepy offspring makes it's home in Jerboa's warm belly pouch. Before you know it, there are werewolves everywhere (my favorite onscreen werewolf transmogrification ever is at the ballet rehearsal) and they are terrorizing polite society, causing rifts in both the scientific community and in society at large.This isn't a typical werewolf movie, though. It's more of a lycanthropic love story, complete with hot marsupial action (so do they have kids, pups, or cubs?) There are actually two separate love stories here, and the social discourse that is unveiled is just the kind of thinking we need in a progressive world: even the Pope blesses lycanthropic halfbreeds, enabling them to reenter society (which Jerboa and husband do in Hollywood, of course.) It was a real puzzler knowing what rating to give this movie. It's not a particularly funny spoof; it's certainly not a scary horror story; it has terrible acting and over-the-top plot devices throughout that definitely induce eye-rolling, but despite it's lack of success in any well-defined, conventional sense, I still found it entertaining as a camp classic. It's more elegantly made than most campy movies (although many funny 1980's relics are on prime display,) but it's oddly appealing. I settled on three stars with these conditions: if you want a genuinely scary sequel to an earlier ""Howling"" installment, this is not it, and would rate a single star; if you want a piece of peculiar, slyly funny sci-fi camp, this is close to five stars. Beauty has never been more in the eye of the beholder: ""Howling III"" is utterly ridiculous, campy, funny (sometimes intentionally, sometimes not,) and strangely entertaining.",3,"""What's Going On?""...""There's A Pack Of Marsupial Werewolves On The Loose.""",1282521600,"08 23, 2010",2010,2955,"['Howling', 'III', 'not', 'really', 'related', 'earlier', 'Howling', 'entries', 'create', 'howls', 'entirely', 'different', 'type', 'film', 'Australia', '1905', 'villagers', 'taunting', 'half-man', 'half-bear', 'creature', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'even', 'not', 'creature', 'pouch', 'eats', 'eucalyptus', 'film', 'neck', 'jump', 'cut', 'man', 'screaming', 'top', 'lungs', 'Siberia', 'thirty', 'seconds', 'film', 'know', 'what', 'good', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'right', 'there.In', 'matter', 'national', 'security', 'US', 'intelligence', 'up', 'evidence', 'werewolves', 'marauding', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'was', 'made', 'Berlin', 'Wall', 'fell', 'question', 'what', 'kind', 'apparatus', 'US', 'have', 'monitoring', 'worldwide', 'werewolf', 'activity', 'was', 'skeptical', 'Speaking', 'skeptical', 'President', 'was', 'also', 'skeptical', 'were', 'wrong', 'out', 'out', 'unemployed', 'actress', 'who', 'also', 'werewolf', 'marsupial', 'named', 'Jerboa', 'Jerboa', 'Imogen', 'Annesley', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'next', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'movie', 'was', 'laughing', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'name', 'concentrate', 'quite', 'while', 'Jerboa', 'involved', 'human', 'breed', 'creepy', 'offspring', 'home', 'Jerboa', 'warm', 'belly', 'pouch', 'know', 'are', 'werewolves', 'everywhere', 'favorite', 'onscreen', 'werewolf', 'transmogrification', 'ever', 'ballet', 'rehearsal', 'are', 'terrorizing', 'polite', 'society', 'causing', 'rifts', 'scientific', 'community', 'society', 'large.This', ""n't"", 'typical', 'werewolf', 'movie', 'though', 'more', 'lycanthropic', 'love', 'story', 'complete', 'hot', 'marsupial', 'action', 'so', 'do', 'have', 'kids', 'pups', 'cubs', 'are', 'actually', 'two', 'separate', 'love', 'stories', 'here', 'social', 'discourse', 'unveiled', 'just', 'kind', 'thinking', 'need', 'progressive', 'world', 'even', 'Pope', 'lycanthropic', 'halfbreeds', 'enabling', 'reenter', 'society', 'Jerboa', 'husband', 'do', 'Hollywood', 'course', 'was', 'real', 'puzzler', 'knowing', 'what', 'rating', 'give', 'movie', 'not', 'particularly', 'funny', 'spoof', 'certainly', 'not', 'scary', 'horror', 'story', 'terrible', 'acting', 'over-the-top', 'plot', 'devices', 'definitely', 'induce', 'eye-rolling', 'lack', 'success', 'well-defined', 'conventional', 'sense', 'still', 'found', 'entertaining', 'camp', 'classic', 'more', 'elegantly', 'made', 'most', 'campy', 'movies', 'many', 'funny', '1980', 'relics', 'are', 'prime', 'display', 'oddly', 'appealing', 'settled', 'three', 'stars', 'conditions', 'want', 'genuinely', 'scary', 'sequel', 'earlier', 'Howling', 'installment', 'not', 'would', 'rate', 'single', 'star', 'want', 'piece', 'peculiar', 'slyly', 'funny', 'sci-fi', 'camp', 'close', 'five', 'stars', 'Beauty', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'eye', 'beholder', 'Howling', 'III', 'utterly', 'ridiculous', 'campy', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'intentionally', 'sometimes', 'not', 'strangely', 'entertaining']",N/A
