957718,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000CEV3P0,Grady Harp,"[2, 2]","Paul Reiser steps away from the standup comedy spotlight to write a warmly humorous and gently tender story about family - what we see and what we don't see, what we expect and what surprises us.  THE THING ABOUT MY FOLKS doesn't set any new standards for film, but it is a fine little story well told that reminds us about the significant bonds that family represents.Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) has been a workaholic, at times pushing his wife Muriel (Olympia Dukakis), his daughters (Mackenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan), and his son Ben (Paul Reiser) into the background.  One day Muriel leaves a note that after years of marriage she is leaving!  Her daughters, along with Ben's wife Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins) immediately begin the search for her whereabouts, leaving the confused and hurt and disgruntle Sam to sort things out on a road trip with son Ben. The road trip becomes a time for the two men to learn who each other is and what they each mean to their status as father and son and as family members.  Sam relaxes for the first time in his life and introduces the now workaholic Ben to the pleasures and fun of living.  The trip comes to an end with a phone call about the whereabouts of  Muriel and why she left and the regrouping of the wiser family draws the story's warm ending.  All is not what it seemed: it's better and, well, different.Falk and Reiser play off each other like the pros they are, but in many ways the film belongs to the brief moments when Olympia Dukakis is on screen, reminding us that she is one of our strongest matriarchs on film.Well worth viewing.

957719,A3080YC6R9G303,B000CEV3P0,Greg Robertson,"[3, 5]","In his best and funniest work since 'Mad About You,' Paul Reiser plays the son of an elderly couple (Peter Falk and Olympia Dukakis) who both try to squeeze a last bit of meaning out of their increasingly-shorter lives -- in their own separate ways.  For the sisters of Reiser's character, this results in a lengthy search for their missing Mom.  For Reiser and Falk, the simultaneous result is a road trip filled with the most fun and adventure they ever had together as father and son.The only ""acting"" worth anything here comes from Peter Falk, who is terrific as a dad put on the defensive for his 1950s work ethic and how it affected his wife and kids over the years.  It's territory a lot of us middle aged kids can relate to, including a lot of laughs and, yeah, even a few tears.  The other actors are good enough, but Dukakis' role is VERY short, Reiser will always be more comedian than actor, and Elizabeth Perkins, as Reiser's wife, plays the same character that she has in every movie since 'Big.'

957724,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000CEV3P0,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","""The Thing About My Folks"" is a pleasant, if not at all surprising, little diversion. In a bit of male wish fulfillment, a man and his father find themselves on an unlikely roadtrip--and thus have the time to learn about one another and bond in ways previously foreign to them both. This seriocomic adventure stars Paul Reiser and Peter Falk as the duo, and the piece was obviously put together as an ode to familial love. What little boy doesn't yearn to spend more time with his dad? Apparently, even into adulthood, that's not something you ever get over.After a fairly contrived and perfunctory beginning, our guys get on the road. Their escapades are pleasingly familiar which means that we're treated to a lot of cliche'd moments. As you might expect--we get ballgames, camping, fishing, drinking, smoking, carousing with women, and any other father/son interaction you might hope for. It's all very tame, though, but there is a warm humor to be had throughout. Naturally, they grow closer and there are some sweet (and completely expected) moments.There is nothing particularly wrong with ""The Thing About My Folks""--it's just so safe and unassuming. I suspect many will be attracted to it's comfortable feeling and experience a tugging sensation on their heartstrings. It has the feel of a good Cable TV movie, and never strives to be anything other than pleasant. In that it succeeds, it's pleasant. It is good to see Falk back in a leading role, and he makes the most of it. It's a very likable performance.People who like the ""warm and fuzzies"" should like this film--but if it sounds like it's not your type of film, it probably isn't.

In my book, nothing lowers the intelligence level of a person or movie more efficiently than a constant barrage of swearing and cursing, particularly the F-word.  The barrage didn't let up and I willed myself to sleep a little more than half-way through.  Husband watched the rest of the movie and filled me in later.  He informed me that the cursing didn't let up.  Reiser's character was the worst.  Funny thing, his character never swore at home around his wife and kids but did everywhere else.  My life observations tell me that this is a very unrealistic scenario.  What could have been a thoughtful, intelligent movie was destroyed in it's quest for the all-important PG-13 rating.  It's not as if it spent a lot of time, if any, in the theatres anyway.  Bad move.Aside from the mindless cursing: Olympia Dukakis - one of my favorite actresses, is hardly even in the movie.  Never saw her during the whole portion I was awake through.  Saw her in the closing scene when I woke up.  Husband said didn't appear much more than that.  What a waste of a great actress.

He has a heart of gold, although he seems to be quite difficult to deal with. What a character, though!

She is one hell of an actor, as is Peter Falk.Paul Reiser made a mistake in not creating a documentary - something along the lines of ""A Day with My Hero.""  It would have been better for Reiser to have a one-on-one experience that we could enjoy.  There could have been several installations of this, including getting to go ""fishing with my hero.""Many of us dream about spending a day, or more, with someone we admire.  Most of us would be awkward about it, if given the chance.  Reiser's film, and Reiser himself, are clearly uncomfortable.  And who can blame him?  He has done what we would  like to do, but don't have the access.  But he should have made it as completely personal as he really wanted the experience to be.  (I'd bet that he has many regrets about things he didn't get to say to Mr. Falk, or do with Peter Falk, and that's a pity).Reiser made this film because of his adoration for Peter Falk, and, Mr. Falk was lovely to consent to do the film. The script is not good.  The direction is not good.  Time spent with a hero, on the other hand, might well have been brilliant, but I don't fault Reiser one bit for so much wanting to be part of the light and life of his star.",2,The wrong way for Reiser to catch a dream.,1285200000,"09 23, 2010",2010,1287,"['script', 'bad', 'Olympia', 'Dukakis', 'appearances', 'movie', 'are', 'slightly', 'more', 'cameo', 'one', 'hell', 'actor', 'Peter', 'Falk.Paul', 'Reiser', 'made', 'mistake', 'not', 'creating', 'documentary', 'something', 'lines', 'Day', 'My', 'Hero', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Reiser', 'have', 'one-on-one', 'experience', 'could', 'enjoy', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'several', 'installations', 'including', 'getting', 'go', 'fishing', 'hero', 'Many', 'dream', 'spending', 'day', 'more', 'someone', 'admire', 'Most', 'would', 'be', 'awkward', 'given', 'chance', 'Reiser', 'film', 'Reiser', 'are', 'clearly', 'uncomfortable', 'who', 'can', 'blame', 'done', 'what', 'would', 'like', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'access', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'completely', 'personal', 'really', 'wanted', 'experience', 'be', ""'d"", 'bet', 'many', 'regrets', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'say', 'Mr.', 'Falk', 'do', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'pity', '.Reiser', 'made', 'film', 'adoration', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'Mr.', 'Falk', 'was', 'lovely', 'consent', 'do', 'film', 'script', 'not', 'good', 'direction', 'not', 'good', 'Time', 'spent', 'hero', 'other', 'hand', 'might', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'brilliant', 'do', ""n't"", 'fault', 'Reiser', 'one', 'bit', 'so', 'much', 'wanting', 'be', 'part', 'light', 'life', 'star']",The Thing About My Folks
