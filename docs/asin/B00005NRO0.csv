In fact, I wondered how someone got funding to do a REAL movie for once.  Jennifer Lopez keeps your attention through-out the movie, and for anyone who wants to see a woman in a strong role (for once), she manages it.  No nonsense.  At first, I was upset with how her family behaves toward her, but then I realized...this movie is about real life.  For anyone who wants to see a movie well-acted with a completely different feel to it...this is an excellent choice to see.  And you will feel the adrenaline pumping through you when she is yelling at her brother for the wicked thing he did.",4,Very different.,990662400,"05 24, 2001",2001,706,"['had', ""n't"", 'even', 'planned', 'seeing', 'movie', 'happened', 'film', 'NOT', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'garbage', 'pieces', 'fact', 'wondered', 'how', 'someone', 'got', 'funding', 'do', 'REAL', 'movie', 'once', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'attention', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'see', 'woman', 'strong', 'role', 'once', 'nonsense', 'first', 'was', 'upset', 'how', 'family', 'then', 'realized', 'movie', 'real', 'life', 'anyone', 'who', 'see', 'movie', 'well-acted', 'completely', 'different', 'feel', 'excellent', 'choice', 'see', 'will', 'feel', 'adrenaline', 'pumping', 'when', 'yelling', 'brother', 'wicked', 'thing', 'did']",N/A

Moir""","[1, 1]","I rarely even give tear-jerkers the time of day, I'm more of a Harrison Ford/Clint Eastwood/band-em-up type of fan, but when I tuned into ""Angel Eyes"" while running on the treadmill, I liked it so much that I stayed on the machine for the full length. What I got was a great workout both physically and emotionally. I don't need to summarize the plot; the Amazon main review reflects exactly what I thought, and many reviewers have done a great job. I just wanted to add my two cents that, as a 31-year-old grit/action fan, I still enjoyed this film a lot. It's not the saccharine silly love of every other chick-flick, this movie deals with the difficulties of love in this world, on two fronts: family and partner. This is definitely the best Jennifer Lopez movie I've ever seen (gosh, ""Anaconda"" might be a close second!) and Caviezel has the perfect blend of romantic/haunted/creepy that makes ""Catch"" a deep character. He's a great guy with a CATCH of his own: if you love him, you have to understand his past.I really felt good at the end, as it didn't finish on a silly little everything's-peachy note. I think the director and screenwriter did a great job of tying it up in the finale. See what you think. And guys: don't be afraid of this one.

Many people I talked with after seeing the movie told me they thought it was a ghost story. I myself thought it was going to be a detective story. As it turns out,it's a love story. &quot;Angel Eyes&quot; is a differnt type of movie we (the American public)are use to watching. And, to be honest, I'm glad it's not the average everyday Hollywood fare we've been getting lately. But, unfortunately not many people share my same opinions, as it's not doing very well at the box office. In just 3 weeks the film has managed to gross a little over 21 million dollars. Jennifer Lopez stars as Sharon Pogue, a Chicago cop who meets an usually man, played by James Cauiezel (Catch). There's something Sharon (Lopez) just can't figure out about this guy, like why doesn't he ever shave? lol. No, but really, she just can't seem to place him. Who is he? That's not only the question she wants answered but, so do we! Now, in order to be honest, I have to &quot;warn&quot; people who go see this movie. The beggining scenes with Catch (Cauiezel) may not make much sense to you. You may start to come to your own conclusions about him too quickly. &quot;Angel Eyes&quot; is best described as a puzzle. And it's at the very end we find all the pieces, everything makes sense. I really don't want to spoil everything for thoses who decide to go see this movie by giving away too much of the plot. The less you know, the better. All you really have to know is, it's not a ghost story. Director Luis Manoki and writter Gerald Di Pego have come up with a very interesting approach to take on a love story. It works and carries your attention. The characters are pretty well developed, and we sorta get that sense that we &quot;know&quot; them. Which I personally like when movies do that. I unlike a lot of people liked &quot;The Cell&quot;, and to me, and Lopez fans (I'm not one) this is a letdown, if for any reason, because it was an unexpected move, it's not because this is a bad movie. I really think people will like this movie if they give it a chance. I read a lot of people say it's boring or slow, hey, no one seemed to mind sitting threw 3 hours of &quot;Titanic&quot;! &quot;Angel Eyes&quot; isn't really getting a fair shake, it's a good movie and I hope more people enjoy it.",3,"&quot;Angel Eyes, That Old Devil Sent...ect&quot;",992476800,"06 14, 2001",2001,2346,"['quot', 'Angel', 'Eyes', 'quot', 'had', 'lot', 'misconceptions', 'floating', 'Many', 'people', 'talked', 'seeing', 'movie', 'told', 'thought', 'was', 'ghost', 'story', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'detective', 'story', 'out', 'love', 'story', 'quot', 'Angel', 'Eyes', 'quot', 'differnt', 'type', 'movie', 'American', 'public', 'are', 'use', 'watching', 'be', 'honest', ""'m"", 'glad', 'not', 'average', 'everyday', 'Hollywood', 'fare', ""'ve"", 'been', 'getting', 'lately', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'many', 'people', 'share', 'same', 'opinions', 'not', 'doing', 'very', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'just', '3', 'weeks', 'film', 'managed', 'gross', 'little', '21', 'million', 'dollars', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'Sharon', 'Pogue', 'Chicago', 'cop', 'who', 'usually', 'man', 'played', 'James', 'Cauiezel', 'Catch', 'something', 'Sharon', 'Lopez', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'guy', 'why', ""n't"", 'ever', 'shave', 'lol', 'No', 'really', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'place', 'Who', 'not', 'only', 'question', 'answered', 'so', 'do', 'Now', 'order', 'be', 'honest', 'have', 'quot', 'quot', 'people', 'who', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'beggining', 'scenes', 'Catch', 'Cauiezel', 'may', 'not', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'may', 'start', 'come', 'own', 'conclusions', 'too', 'quickly', 'quot', 'Angel', 'Eyes', 'quot', 'best', 'described', 'puzzle', 'very', 'end', 'find', 'pieces', 'everything', 'sense', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'everything', 'thoses', 'who', 'decide', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'less', 'know', 'better', 'really', 'have', 'know', 'not', 'ghost', 'story', 'Director', 'Luis', 'Manoki', 'writter', 'Gerald', 'Di', 'Pego', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'very', 'interesting', 'approach', 'take', 'love', 'story', 'attention', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'well', 'developed', 'sorta', 'get', 'sense', 'quot', 'know', 'quot', 'Which', 'personally', 'when', 'movies', 'do', 'lot', 'people', 'liked', 'quot', 'Cell', 'quot', 'Lopez', 'fans', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'letdown', 'reason', 'was', 'unexpected', 'move', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'really', 'think', 'people', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'give', 'chance', 'read', 'lot', 'people', 'say', 'boring', 'slow', 'hey', 'one', 'seemed', 'mind', 'sitting', 'threw', '3', 'hours', 'quot', 'Titanic', 'quot', 'quot', 'Angel', 'Eyes', 'quot', ""n't"", 'really', 'getting', 'fair', 'shake', 'good', 'movie', 'hope', 'more', 'people', 'enjoy']",N/A

Jennifer Lopez is riveting as a Chicago cop who is still hurting over the many conflicts she has had since chilhood with her abusive father and passive mother. One night on the job she is saved from death by a mysterious drifter (Jim Caviezel) who seems just as heartbroken over something, but he won't say what. Caviezel matches Lopez's performance in his moody role, but as has been the case with his last few films his hairstylists and makeup artists seem determined to completely hide the fact that this is a very good looking guy (realism is one thing, but come on! We're paying money here!) The experience of the film is that these two people heal each other simply by becoming each other's friends, and Mandoki's sense of atmosphere gives much to the film (the aforementioned Meg Ryan weepie, on the other hand, was never quite so effective). Better films have been made along this theme, from Passion Fish to As Good As It Gets, but anyone who likes a slow but steady drama about people revealing themselves to one another will definitely want to take a look at this worthwhile romance.

Jennifer Lopez and James Caviezel do an outstanding job as the two romantic leads in this urban drama.  Director Luis Mandoki also shines in pointing the spotlight at a family domestic violence problem that has left Lopez's character, Chicago cop Sharon Pogue, sealed off from her own family for turning her father in for his acts against her mother.  Worse, her brother seems to be emulating the father yet the family still blames the daughter for blowing the whistle. Mandoki captures perfectly this entire subgenre of domestic law and doesn't resolve it sappily.  Caviezel's character Catch does not have a violent bone in his body.  He is a very gentle man, a musician, who leads  a life as an urban knight, helping those in distress.  He seems to have no visible means of support, doesn't work and lives in an apartment with no furniture.

I haven't enjoyed a movie so much since 'The Contender', or maybe 'Out of Sight'.This movie is not at all what I expected, or even what the movie blurb leads you to believe.  It's one of those great movies that has a plot you can't predict.  You don't know how this movie is going to end and you don't know where it's going.But it's just enjoyable and intriguing to see the two lead characters reveal themselves and develop.  A really mature, well-written script, both funny, sassy, courageous, and poignant.  I don't know where they got the hokey title; they must have grabbed it out of a hat.  But don't be fooled, the packaging has mismarketed an unusually good story.  It's not a date movie; the movie deals with deep emotional issues, but thankfully in an uncliched way.  Events play out fairly honestly.  'Angel Eyes' neither cheats its audience nor preaches.And Guess what? Jennifer Lopez really can act, and not just as herself.  I was coerced into seeing 'The Wedding Planner' right before this one and the difference in both the script and her acting is HUGE.  Jennifer Lopez has earned her acting chops (and thankfully she's better in this field than in the musical one).Great directing, great casting, great acting.  Five out of five for 'Angel Eyes'.If you like this movie you may want to see 'Deja Vu' or maybe 'The Sixth Sense', which is similar to this movie in tone.

669963,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00005NRO0,D. Litton,"[6, 6]","There's more than just a mystery involved in the plot of &quot;Angel Eyes,&quot; a movie which may or may not deserve the title &quot;thriller.&quot; The reason for this depends on whether or not you've been subjected to the theatrical trailer, which is a big mislead, and if you haven't seen it, then don't. The way in which the movie takes a different path is a bit disappointing, but everything else falls into place nicely. The acting from the two leads is astounding, while the elements of the plot deal with human issues and obstacles, making the film easy to relate to.The story begins at the scene of an auto accident, where police officer Sharon Pogue is busy attempting to keep an unseen victim alive and focused on her. Moving ahead by a year, we are given a more human side of her life: a conversation with her brother begins a storyline of family discord between Sharon and her father, while her intervention with her fellow officers and criminals casts her in a strong light. This is the point at which Catch comes onto the scene, keeping a watch over her and saving her life after a drive-by shooting which ends in an on-foot pursuit.From this point on, the two get to know one another on a more personal level, but Sharon finds that the new man in her life is not all that he seems. His past is touchy subject for conversation, while his apartment remains devoid of furniture, and he walks wherever he goes. Sharon wants to know more, and in her pursuit of the details, she finds herself falling more in love with Catch, who is beginning to remember things from a past that may have more to do with Sharon than either of them think.This is a movie that has its ups and downs, and while the ups have the majority, the downs are not easily ignored. For instance, the promotional material portrays mystery-man Catch as a possible apparition who has walked into her life. Even the first section of the movie itself portrays him as a well-intentioned man, in a scene in which he opens a pedestrian's car door to merely turn off his lights, nothing more. His interactions with others give him a sort of angelic presence, so it comes as a bit of a letdown when the second half takes a totally different approach. Personally, I liked the way the trailers made the movie look. The idea that Catch is an angel who falls in love with a human is intriguing, and while it's certainly not new, to me, it has much more appeal than what the story leaves us with.The story also gives away its secrets too quickly, but for good reasons. Catch begins having flashbacks early into the movie, which will give away the ties he has to Sharon as well as the secrets of his past. But the filmmakers have a certain purpose for that: the overall story is less about the mysteries of Catch's life and more about the personal problems in both he and Sharon's lives, and so some of the secrets are revealed in order to allow the main viewpoint to center on these obstacles.What's good about the movie is the delicate relationship between Catch and Sharon. Sharon has problems with her family, which screenwriter Gerald Dipego keeps well hidden until later points in the film. While her own problems create a life of tension, her need to help Catch discover the secrets of his past and hold onto him also weigh heavily on her mind. Their problems and hardships allow them to act as consolation for each other, not unlike that of a guardian angel watching over an earthly soul.The movie also allows us to get to know the characters, something I greatly admire in a film. From the first introductions, we know who the characters are, their intentions in relation to one another, and how different situations and occurances affect them. Director Luis Mandoki uses a careful pace in order to establish these traits, while also heightening the suspense at times to keep everything in place.The best part about this movie are the performances of the two leads, who are required to carry a majority of the film on their shoulders. Jennifer Lopez is cast as Sharon, and through her acting, she portrays Sharon as strong and determined, as the tough cop with a lighter side. Lopez does some of her best work here, topping her work in &quot;The Cell;&quot; it is evident through her work here that she is easily able to get into her character. Jim Caviezel is Catch, and his looks project a feeling of innocence and goodness (his blue eyes, piercing and effective, always take on the look that he is on the verge of shedding tears). His mental breakdown proves his worth as an actor, and the chemistry between he and Lopez electrifies the screen.&quot;Angel Eyes&quot; is not without its flaws, and the way it all ends seems a bit underachieved. But the way in which everything comes together in the end leaves no loose strings, and that, accompanied with the powerhouse performances by Caviezel and Lopez make this movie well worth watching.",4,"Flawed, but still a great film.",990144000,"05 18, 2001",2001,4917,"['more', 'just', 'mystery', 'involved', 'plot', 'quot', 'Angel', 'Eyes', 'quot', 'movie', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'deserve', 'title', 'quot', 'quot', 'reason', 'not', ""'ve"", 'been', 'subjected', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'big', 'mislead', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'way', 'movie', 'different', 'path', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'everything', 'else', 'place', 'nicely', 'acting', 'two', 'leads', 'astounding', 'elements', 'plot', 'deal', 'human', 'issues', 'obstacles', 'making', 'film', 'easy', 'relate', 'to.The', 'story', 'scene', 'auto', 'accident', 'where', 'police', 'officer', 'Sharon', 'Pogue', 'busy', 'attempting', 'keep', 'unseen', 'victim', 'alive', 'focused', 'Moving', 'ahead', 'year', 'are', 'given', 'more', 'human', 'side', 'life', 'conversation', 'brother', 'storyline', 'family', 'discord', 'Sharon', 'father', 'intervention', 'fellow', 'officers', 'criminals', 'strong', 'light', 'point', 'Catch', 'scene', 'keeping', 'watch', 'saving', 'life', 'drive-by', 'shooting', 'on-foot', 'pursuit.From', 'point', 'two', 'get', 'know', 'one', 'more', 'personal', 'level', 'Sharon', 'new', 'man', 'life', 'not', 'past', 'touchy', 'subject', 'conversation', 'apartment', 'devoid', 'furniture', 'Sharon', 'know', 'more', 'pursuit', 'details', 'falling', 'more', 'love', 'Catch', 'who', 'beginning', 'remember', 'things', 'past', 'may', 'have', 'more', 'do', 'Sharon', 'movie', 'ups', 'downs', 'ups', 'have', 'majority', 'downs', 'are', 'not', 'easily', 'ignored', 'instance', 'promotional', 'material', 'portrays', 'mystery-man', 'Catch', 'possible', 'apparition', 'who', 'walked', 'life', 'Even', 'first', 'section', 'movie', 'well-intentioned', 'man', 'scene', 'pedestrian', 'car', 'door', 'merely', 'turn', 'off', 'lights', 'nothing', 'more', 'interactions', 'others', 'give', 'sort', 'angelic', 'presence', 'bit', 'letdown', 'when', 'second', 'half', 'totally', 'different', 'approach', 'Personally', 'liked', 'way', 'trailers', 'made', 'movie', 'look', 'idea', 'Catch', 'angel', 'who', 'love', 'human', 'intriguing', 'certainly', 'not', 'new', 'much', 'more', 'appeal', 'what', 'story', 'with.The', 'story', 'also', 'away', 'secrets', 'too', 'quickly', 'good', 'reasons', 'Catch', 'having', 'flashbacks', 'early', 'movie', 'will', 'give', 'away', 'ties', 'Sharon', 'as', 'well', 'secrets', 'past', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'certain', 'purpose', 'overall', 'story', 'less', 'mysteries', 'Catch', 'life', 'more', 'personal', 'problems', 'Sharon', 'lives', 'so', 'secrets', 'are', 'revealed', 'order', 'allow', 'main', 'viewpoint', 'center', 'obstacles.What', 'good', 'movie', 'delicate', 'relationship', 'Catch', 'Sharon', 'Sharon', 'problems', 'family', 'screenwriter', 'Gerald', 'Dipego', 'well', 'hidden', 'later', 'points', 'film', 'own', 'problems', 'create', 'life', 'tension', 'need', 'help', 'Catch', 'discover', 'secrets', 'past', 'hold', 'also', 'weigh', 'heavily', 'mind', 'problems', 'hardships', 'allow', 'act', 'consolation', 'other', 'not', 'guardian', 'angel', 'watching', 'earthly', 'soul.The', 'movie', 'also', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'something', 'greatly', 'admire', 'film', 'first', 'introductions', 'know', 'who', 'characters', 'are', 'intentions', 'relation', 'one', 'how', 'different', 'situations', 'occurances', 'affect', 'Director', 'Luis', 'Mandoki', 'careful', 'pace', 'order', 'establish', 'traits', 'also', 'heightening', 'suspense', 'times', 'keep', 'everything', 'place.The', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'are', 'performances', 'two', 'leads', 'who', 'are', 'required', 'carry', 'majority', 'film', 'shoulders', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'cast', 'Sharon', 'acting', 'Sharon', 'strong', 'determined', 'tough', 'cop', 'lighter', 'side', 'Lopez', 'best', 'work', 'here', 'topping', 'work', 'quot', 'Cell', 'quot', 'evident', 'work', 'here', 'easily', 'able', 'get', 'character', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'Catch', 'looks', 'project', 'feeling', 'innocence', 'goodness', 'blue', 'eyes', 'piercing', 'effective', 'always', 'take', 'look', 'verge', 'shedding', 'tears', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'worth', 'actor', 'chemistry', 'Lopez', 'screen.', 'quot', 'Angel', 'Eyes', 'quot', 'not', 'flaws', 'way', 'bit', 'underachieved', 'way', 'everything', 'together', 'end', 'loose', 'strings', 'accompanied', 'powerhouse', 'performances', 'Caviezel', 'Lopez', 'make', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

It revolves around the fallout of a horrible traffic accident and the long-term effects it has on two lives.

669969,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00005NRO0,"""flickjunkie""","[16, 16]","""Angel Eyes"" is an excellent character study that is not likely to have much mass appeal.  It requires a very patient viewer due to its deliberate pacing and subtle presentation.  The great majority of viewers want to be actively entertained when they go to the movies and this is not that sort of film.  Viewing this film is more like trying to navigate a ship through a fog.  You have to stay alert and try to figure things out as you go.The story by Gerald De Pego is well written, presenting two very flawed characters that spend the entire story struggling to overcome a considerable amount of emotional baggage.  I give director Luis Mandoki extremely high marks for his presentation.  Mandoki takes his time and unfolds the story gradually with great nuance.  He takes great care to make sure to avoid being obvious.  Despite the fact that it is readily apparent that Catch (James Caviezel) is the same man that Sharon (Jennifer Lopez) helped in the car wreck in the opening scene (no spoiler here, they almost spoon feed this to you on the movie jacket) everything else needs to be discovered.Mandoki artfully introduces characters in a consistently nebulous way.  When we meet a new character we are not exactly sure during the beginning of the scene to whom we are being introduced and why he or she is important.  It is as if we are overhearing a conversation between two people and we are trying to figure out how they know one another.  The viewer is forced to think (a risky concept with today's fast-food-cinema mentality).  Mandoki constantly supplies us with vague information, making us ask ourselves, ""Okay, how does this fit in.""  It makes the film much more intriguing.My only criticism of Mandoki is that he tries to do too much with Sharon's family relationships. He makes it a full blown subplot that bogs down an already convoluted tale, taking us away from the real story which is about Catch and Sharon.  The entire party scene after the renewal of vows is completely superfluous.  The scenes of Sharon and her partner having soul searching conversations should also have been cut.  Another annoying detail is that Sharon and Catch are constantly driving around wearing no seat belts, which seems to me to be terribly incongruous given that one is a cop and the other a serious auto accident victim.The acting is terrific.  This is the best performance I have seen to date by Jennifer Lopez.  This part tests her talent with its breadth and she delivers a full ranging performance. Sharon is an extremely complex character filled with self doubt, anger and misplaced aggression.  Lopez plays her flawlessly with a delicate combination of toughness and emotional vulnerability, which is a difficult balance to achieve.  Her love scenes are tender and sincere, and her banter with fellow cops is smart and feisty.I was impressed by James Caviezel's performance in ""Frequency"", but I enjoyed this role even better.  Catch is an enigmatic character drifting through a period of anomie.  There is a duality to him, defeated and despondent, yet with a hint of seemingly inconsistent strength that emerges occasionally from his listlessness.  Caviezel's performance appears uneven as we watch it, yet it is perfectly presented and fits the character completely once we learn the whole story about him.  It is a marvelous interpretation of a complicated and puzzling individual.This film is a wonderful character study that is likely to be grossly unappreciated for its intricacy and strong direction.  The character development is masterfully done and the acting is superlative.  I rated it an 8/10.  It is an intelligent and sensitive story for the refined viewer.",4,Intriguing character study.

Yet I looked for deeply rooted emotional++ spiritual traits for both characters! Writer & director accomplished fabulous colors of insight into the personhood of Catch and Sharon.When one review likened him to Jesus, I forgot he acted the role of Jesus in Passion. As he first showed his personal interest in Sharon, she commented on his smile; He really became lit-up! The director makes Catch into the person, you can readily embrace. He illustrates this even more, as they walk, along the street, holding hands. He easily greets all the passer-byes, encouraging her to do the same.Sharon, true to Actress J. Lopez, plays-out gutsy, toughness, as her spiritual intensity changes to Godly patience, just when her partner recognizes it in a new-found treatment of those street tough boys, are being arrested and placed into squad car!From my perspective, viewing Lopez's best DVD's then seeing her twice on ""Inside the Actors' Studio,"" this became my first time  watching her become a three-dimensional complexity of emotional, physical,and spiritual personhood! She was capable to portray an Enigma as Abused Lover, yet Police-woman holding in-reserve her personal tragedy. All-in-all both characters portrayed emotional growth spiritual confidence!

669972,A3HETHW2XD3DWH,B00005NRO0,frisky2000,"[5, 6]","With the exception of her title role as SELENA in the '90's, Jennifer Lopez has done many films with little substance, but this picture brought her to the forefront of decent movie actors who can hold her own with the new generation of Hollywood starletts, i.e., Julia Roberts, Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz.  All have played dramatic roles as well as comedic parts, but in my opinion none have done the transition better than Lopez.  In Angel Eyes, her portrayal of Sharon, an emotionally drained policewoman haunted by a fatal car accident where she tried to save the victims, is one of sensitivity and raw emotion.  She makes us believe the torment inside her and when she falls for Catch, a moody and handsome stranger whose secret past she can't quite figure out, we are rooting for them to make their way through the rocky road of their romance.Catch is portrayed by Jim Caviezel, the wonderful actor whose role as Christ in this year's THE PASSION of the Christ, is so stirring that he should walk away with the Academy Award.  He also portrays a warm-hearted homeless man in Pay if Forward with Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt and brings the same sincere feeling to his role in ANGEL EYES as he does to the others.

Considering I'm the type who prefers comedies, I was surprised to find that ""Angel Eyes"" was an excellent, excellent movie. Jennifer Lopez delivers an awesome performance here. I never was really a big fan of hers, but I must say that she was great in this film. This may very well be one of her best performances. In this gripping drama, she portrays Sharon Pogue, a tough cop who is very focused on her job and nothing else. She doesn't really want to let anyone in her life, mainly because of a painful past she's endured with her family. The mysterious Catch comes along later on. He is a lot like Sharon in many ways; he is secluded, and the loss of his family has brought him to build a wall around himself. But when Sharon and Catch meet, it's instant chemistry. Through their individual decisions to let one another into their lives, emotional healing gradually brings about peace for both of them. Though some people consider this to be a ghost story, I don't think it is at all. It's just a very powerful movie with a LOT of action and occasional violence throughout.

But suddenly, Selena herself is on the scene, trying to revive the victim. Fast-forward one year later, and gunfire erupts while Selena is having lunch with fellow officers, when she is saved from certain death by a mysterious stranger known only as Catch. There are many surprises in store for the viewer...Jwnnifer Lopez and Jim Caviezel (who was cast at the insistence of Jennifer Lopez, who had been impressed with his performance in The Thin Red Line, despite not knowing his name) deliver fantastic and deeply moving performances in this intricately wrought tale of woe. Audiences who have only seen Mr. Caviezel in The Count Of Monte Cristo, The Passion Of The Christ or CBS' hit drama PERSON OF INTEREST will be pleased to discover that he is an incredible actor, as his role here is a bit more complex than in the afore-mentioned movies and television series. Ms. Lopez is also an incredible actress. She should do more movies like this. My only gripe, story-wise, is that there isn't a sufficient resolution to the sub-plots with the neighbor Candace & Sharon's abusive brother, Other than that, I loved the film. SPOILER ALERT!!! One last thing; the profaning of the Lord's Name (ie. combining God's Name with a mild curse word) is like nails on a chalkboard, at least to me. Hell, even the f-word would have been fine instead of during that moment towards the end when Sharon yells at her brother to have a moment alone with her equally abusive father.

It's an interesting script about a cop named Sharon (Jennifer Lopez) who is at an accident where Catch (Jim Caviezel) is near unconcious and she pleads for him to stay with her. A year later, after a gang retaliates after an arrest Sharon makes, she puts herself in danger by trying to track down the criminal. The criminal almost kills her, but Catch saves her. Slowly they start to get to know each other, not knowing that they encountered each other the year before at the accident. She's a tough woman who is hurt by her painful past, and he's a man who is desperately trying to avoid his past and pretend like it didn't happen. She wants to know about him, but he has walls all around him and won't let her in. When she starts to piece together his past life, she remembers the accident and their encounter. She tries to force him to face his grief over the death of his wife and son (who were in the car accident with him, he was the sole survivor), she pushes him too hard and fears she's lost him forever. Afterwards he finds the courage to face what happened, and to talk to his wife and son at the graveyard. Meanwhile, Sharon has her own demons to deal with when she attends the ceremony in which her parents are being remarried. When she was younger, her father abused her mother and she called the police, and her whole family shut her out and never forgave her. While attending, trying to extend an olive branch, she realizes her family and most importantly her father will never forgive her. She runs into Catch again, and breaks down saying how unfair it is of them to punish her, since she did the right thing. It is only then when they connect and admit they love each other, and that it doesn't have to be perfect. I found this movie to be very touching and sensitive.

Price ""kreisleriana""","[1, 2]","After ""catching"" the last half-hour or so of this film on television a few weeks ago I picked up the DVD -- I love weepy stories with happy endings.  Within 30 seconds of the opening titles, I was completely surprised and riveted by Angel Eyes.  Characters, story, it all worked for me.  I won't even try to find fault, the film felt ""personal.""Jennifer Lopez is credible as Sharon Pogue, well-liked, a tough, impatient cop with a relentless sense of right and wrong.  She is quick to reject anyone trying to get too close, yet her bravado fades when she is alone at night.  Her baggage is her estrangement from family.  Of course she would fall for the strange, gentle man who pursues her.  (I came upon Ms. Lopez and crew filming a music video near my office a few years ago --  she was great to watch.)James Caviezel's portrayal of Catch is, for me, the personification of grief.  What happened to this guy, this artistic, loving man, would not be easily gotten over.  I once lost someone whom I could not afford to lose, and all I could do for that person was grieve completely then decide to go on living.  I recognized such grief in watching Caviezel, with his detachment and his shuffling walk.  By the way, my theory about his name, ""Catch,"" is that the last thing he heard before impact was his son's voice calling ""Daddy, catch!"" then playfully throwing a toy that went uncaught.Sonia Braga stands out as Sharon's mother, the faithful wife of a hard man.  Shirley Knight shines as Catch's mother-in-law, who hopes he can ""see the love in it"" in spite of himself as she reaches out to him.  Terrence Howard, as Sharon's partner, brought life to his character with humor and affection.  Kari Matchett, as Catch's neighbor Candace, cracked me up with her venomous, one-sided telephone conversation.  And wasn't Sharon's boring date here played by nasty old Theron (Dominic West) from this year's 300?  I couldn't find the character or his name listed in the credits.  The soundtrack, by Marco Beltrami and various artists, is good support, reminiscent in places of minimalist John Adams, other times sounding like a broken toy.There are special features:  Luis Mandoki's droll commentary is very entertaining.  In it, he describes Jennifer Lopez's ease in performing the fence-jumping stunt that the stuntwoman wasn't able to pull off.  That being the case, I don't see any reason why she couldn't restrain a bad guy.Interestingly, this movie is not coy or overly manipulative.  It is what it is - a love story about two hurt people who decide to risk loving each other, to start from scratch, and choose to live.  It is not Sixth Sense.

Not only she can act the socks off the likes of Gywneth Paltrow, she has the added bonus of being a red hot singer too.The plot is quite complex but surprisingly easy to follow.  Lopez plays a dedicated cop called Sharon who has her fair share of emotional demons to cope with, along with a stressful job, an over protective partner, and a dysfunctional family life that is just getting worse.  James Caviezel plays Catch, a mysterious young man who comes into her life abruptly, saving her from a gun toting assailant.  They know each other but are unable to voice this knowledge because they are perfect strangers...aren't they?  The story steadily moves through Sharon and Catch's lives as they come to terms with secrets, family ghosts and their blossoming love for each other.  This is an unusual love story, with great camera angles, and the flash back between past and present is done with a ghost like subtly that makes you shiver.  And no, Jennifer Lopez doesn't burst into song every five seconds, in fact it is James Caviezel who has the musical ability, playing jazz on a trumpet in an elegant downtown bar as Lopez watches on in delight.  Also the musical score is great which makes this film all the more watchable.All the cast in this film are great, right down to Bob the stray mutt that Catch takes in and gives a home.This is a smart film for smart people.

Those who have the luxury of being unacquainted with family violence may comment that the movie doesn't seem to be about anything; but in reality it is about the deepest of issues, the love for your parents and loathing men who hit women.  With Victor Argo's somewhat stiff father and Sonja Braga's multi-layered performance as Sharon's mother, we see a family trying to heal, but not quite getting there.The other major issue comes from Catch's perspective, dealing with loss.  How having those closest to you ripped away in an instant can take your sanity and send it to the stratosphere.  So is Caviezel a little spacey, a little creepy?  You bet.  The scene at the end of the film where he finally talks in the graveyard to his wife & son is so emotionally powerful.  He talks about all of the minutes of our life and how this memory or that memory was ""a good minute.""  And Caviezel NAILS this performance.  If Oscars were given solely on merit, Denzel Washington would have gotten his for something other than ""Training Day"" & Caviezel would have his for ""Angel Eyes.""The supporting cast are also marvelous.  Shirley Knight who was twice nominated for an Oscar (""Dark At the Top of the Stairs"" [1960] & ""Sweet Bird of Youth"" [1962]), does a masterful job as the mother of the woman who died in the car accident.  Jeremy Sisto as brother Larry, (Clueless [1995]) who himself becomes a wife beater, is alternately interesting & repellent.  Monet Mazur who was a drug user with Johnny Depp in ""Blow"" and hit on Josh Hartnett in ""40 Days & 40 Nights"" does a great job as the abused sister-in-law.  Sharon's partner Robby played by Terrance Howard also has great levels as a prospective father, horny friend, and good cop.  One of the reasons this film is so good is that it gives all of the supporting roles a range of levels on which each actor delivers.When Catch & Sharon go into the jazz club, Catch is drawn to on stage by the lure of the trumpet.  The haunting theme he renders is also the music used in the ""Moulin Rouge"" film.The DVD version really does have little to offer other than digital playback over the video cassette.  There are no deleted scenes, no cast interviews, and a less-than-interesting acting resume for the principles.Step by step, this movie builds toward the emotional climax.  Lopez is rejected by her family only to find acceptance and love with Catch; while Catch accepts the loss of his family and new life in his love for Sharon.  Jennifer Lopez is superb!  Supported by the issues of loss & family violence, ""Angel Eyes"" becomes more than just a romantic film, but is deeply moving.  I call very few films ""brilliant,"" but for me, ""Angel Eyes"" is brilliant, one of the best!  Don't miss it!",5,Caviezel's Oscar-caliber performance,1037577600,"11 18, 2002",2002,3397,"['Actors', 'covet', 'roles', 'allow', 'wide', 'range', 'emotions', 'Angel', 'Eyes', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'emotional', 'gamut', 'Lopez', 'who', 'spotted', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'demanded', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'credited', 'much', 'film', 'quality', 'watched', 'film', 'theatre', 'high', 'expectations', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'left', 'town', 'went', 'back', '2', 'more', 'times', 'DVD', 'was', 'Christmas', 'list', 'last', 'year', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'watched', '11', 'times', ""n't"", 'lose', 'appeal', 'me.The', 'film', 'deals', 'heaviest', 'personal', 'emotional', 'issues', 'Sharon', 'Pogue', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'family', 'where', 'father', 'hit', 'mother', 'who', 'have', 'luxury', 'being', 'unacquainted', 'family', 'violence', 'may', 'comment', 'movie', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'anything', 'reality', 'deepest', 'issues', 'love', 'parents', 'loathing', 'men', 'who', 'hit', 'women', 'Victor', 'Argo', 'somewhat', 'stiff', 'father', 'Sonja', 'Braga', 'multi-layered', 'performance', 'Sharon', 'mother', 'see', 'family', 'trying', 'heal', 'not', 'quite', 'getting', 'other', 'major', 'issue', 'Catch', 'perspective', 'dealing', 'loss', 'How', 'having', 'closest', 'ripped', 'away', 'instant', 'can', 'take', 'sanity', 'send', 'stratosphere', 'Caviezel', 'little', 'spacey', 'little', 'creepy', 'bet', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'where', 'finally', 'graveyard', 'wife', 'son', 'so', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'minutes', 'life', 'how', 'memory', 'memory', 'was', 'good', 'minute', 'Caviezel', 'NAILS', 'performance', 'Oscars', 'were', 'given', 'solely', 'merit', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'something', 'other', 'Training', 'Day', 'Caviezel', 'would', 'have', 'Angel', 'Eyes', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'also', 'marvelous', 'Shirley', 'Knight', 'who', 'was', 'twice', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Dark', 'Top', 'Stairs', '[', '1960', ']', 'Sweet', 'Bird', 'Youth', '[', '1962', ']', 'masterful', 'job', 'mother', 'woman', 'who', 'died', 'car', 'accident', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'brother', 'Larry', 'Clueless', '[', '1995', ']', 'who', 'wife', 'beater', 'alternately', 'interesting', 'repellent', 'Monet', 'Mazur', 'who', 'was', 'drug', 'user', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Blow', 'hit', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', '40', 'Days', '40', 'Nights', 'great', 'job', 'abused', 'sister-in-law', 'Sharon', 'partner', 'Robby', 'played', 'Terrance', 'Howard', 'also', 'great', 'levels', 'prospective', 'father', 'horny', 'friend', 'good', 'cop', 'One', 'reasons', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'supporting', 'roles', 'range', 'levels', 'actor', 'delivers.When', 'Catch', 'Sharon', 'go', 'jazz', 'club', 'Catch', 'drawn', 'stage', 'lure', 'trumpet', 'haunting', 'theme', 'also', 'music', 'used', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'film.The', 'DVD', 'version', 'really', 'have', 'little', 'offer', 'other', 'digital', 'playback', 'video', 'cassette', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'cast', 'interviews', 'less-than-interesting', 'acting', 'resume', 'principles.Step', 'step', 'movie', 'emotional', 'climax', 'Lopez', 'rejected', 'family', 'only', 'find', 'acceptance', 'love', 'Catch', 'Catch', 'loss', 'family', 'new', 'life', 'love', 'Sharon', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'superb', 'Supported', 'issues', 'loss', 'family', 'violence', 'Angel', 'Eyes', 'more', 'just', 'romantic', 'film', 'deeply', 'moving', 'call', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'brilliant', 'Angel', 'Eyes', 'brilliant', 'one', 'best', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss']",N/A

The primary reason for this is because this is not really a romance or a 'chick flick'. Its a very mature story about two adults who have been horribly hurt by their pasts, and who use each other in the most positive way possible to grow and blossom. It is absolutely gritty, real and spares no awkward emotion in making us believe that these are real people with real problems.No fan of Lopez here, but her nuanced performance made me realize that she is definitely an actress who should have won awards for this role. She is tremendously expressive, and towards the end of the movie, she is spectacular. My personal favorite scene was the climax, where the writers could have made a 'happy ending', but instead its a sad, true depiction of what happens even in the best families today. Just so amazing.Jim Caviezel, who was never a great actor to begin with, uses his silent presence to his advantage. Everything about this film just works, and even if you think that you may not be a 'slow movie' kind of person, you will enjoy this. Its sad that people often overlook this once they see that picture of J-Lo on the cover, but this really is a fine piece of film-making, comparable to the greatest films ever made (it really is THAT good).Five Stars.

The first time I saw Angel Eyes last May, I didn't care for it. Now that I have seen it a second time, I realize it wasn't the movie's fault. The problem was caused by Warner Brothers publicity department, which put together trailers that depicted the film as a supernatural thriller. It isn't that at all. It's a romance. The next time I watched it, I knew that and enjoyed it a lot. It is almost all about the relationships between people and has so little action and suspense that some viewers will give a rating of two yawns. Others will be fascinated.Sharon Pogue [Jennifer Lopez] is a Chicago cop. She's good at what she does, and she likes her job. Her personal life barely exists at all, as much because of her childhood as her profession. Hers is a dysfunctional family, one which operates beyond the pat answers and cliches usually found in American movies. Sharon's father, Carl [Victor Argo], used to abuse her mother, Josephine [Sonia Braga]. Years ago, Sharon turned her father in to the police. The abuse stopped, but, much as in real life, the family turned Sharon into the villain. Now her parents are about to renew their wedding vows. She's been invited but doubts her father really wants her to attend. Meanwhile, a lost and lonely young man named Catch [James Caviezel] sees Sharon in the street. He is attracted to her, but is perplexed because it has been a long time since anyone has intruded into his very private world. Eventually, the movie reveals what is so special about her. It turns out Sharon thinks he's pretty special, too, but she also has built walls around herself.Lopez, who is also a pop music star, has increasingly become a refined and assured actress. She was notable in Out of Sight and The Cell, but here she seems very comfortable whether she is in her cop's uniform, dealing with her family or involving herself with Catch. Caviezel is also someone to watch. He is excellent here, as he was on last year's Frequency with Dennis Quaid. He should do well in the next few years. There are few American actors who can be both tender and masculine as well as he can.Angel Eyes has the slower pacing and emphasis on character development found in European films. This is probably why Warner Brothers marketed it so badly. It didn't fit the 'paint by numbers' selling mentality. We tend always to be in a rush these days, even when we aren't really going anywhere, and this applies to Hollywood as well. This is a movie that needed a platform release, which is one where a movie is slowly rolled out across the country. Warner had no time or patience for this and opened it on thousands of screens simultaneously, as if it were just any old generic movie. Perhaps it will find an audience on video.",4,Underrated romantic gem,1015891200,"03 12, 2002",2002,2817,"['can', 'be', 'quite', 'disappointing', 'when', 'movie', 'not', 'what', 'advertised', 'be', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'Angel', 'Eyes', 'last', 'May', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Now', 'have', 'seen', 'second', 'time', 'realize', 'was', ""n't"", 'movie', 'fault', 'problem', 'was', 'caused', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'publicity', 'department', 'put', 'together', 'trailers', 'depicted', 'film', 'supernatural', 'thriller', ""n't"", 'that', 'romance', 'next', 'time', 'watched', 'knew', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'almost', 'relationships', 'people', 'so', 'little', 'action', 'suspense', 'viewers', 'will', 'give', 'rating', 'two', 'yawns', 'Others', 'will', 'be', 'fascinated.Sharon', 'Pogue', '[', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', ']', 'Chicago', 'cop', 'good', 'what', 'job', 'personal', 'life', 'barely', 'much', 'childhood', 'profession', 'Hers', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'one', 'pat', 'answers', 'cliches', 'usually', 'found', 'American', 'movies', 'Sharon', 'father', 'Carl', '[', 'Victor', 'Argo', ']', 'used', 'abuse', 'mother', 'Josephine', '[', 'Sonia', 'Braga', ']', 'Years', 'ago', 'Sharon', 'turned', 'father', 'police', 'abuse', 'stopped', 'much', 'real', 'life', 'family', 'turned', 'Sharon', 'villain', 'Now', 'parents', 'are', 'renew', 'wedding', 'vows', 'been', 'invited', 'father', 'really', 'attend', 'Meanwhile', 'lost', 'lonely', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Catch', '[', 'James', 'Caviezel', ']', 'Sharon', 'street', 'attracted', 'perplexed', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'anyone', 'intruded', 'very', 'private', 'world', 'Eventually', 'movie', 'what', 'so', 'special', 'out', 'Sharon', 'pretty', 'special', 'too', 'also', 'built', 'walls', 'herself.Lopez', 'who', 'also', 'pop', 'music', 'star', 'increasingly', 'become', 'refined', 'assured', 'actress', 'was', 'notable', 'Out', 'Sight', 'Cell', 'here', 'very', 'comfortable', 'cop', 'uniform', 'dealing', 'family', 'involving', 'Catch', 'Caviezel', 'also', 'someone', 'watch', 'excellent', 'here', 'was', 'last', 'year', 'Frequency', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'should', 'do', 'well', 'next', 'few', 'years', 'are', 'few', 'American', 'actors', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'tender', 'masculine', 'as', 'well', 'Eyes', 'slower', 'pacing', 'emphasis', 'character', 'development', 'found', 'European', 'films', 'probably', 'why', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'marketed', 'so', 'badly', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', ""'paint"", 'numbers', 'selling', 'mentality', 'tend', 'always', 'be', 'rush', 'days', 'even', 'when', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'going', 'anywhere', 'applies', 'Hollywood', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'needed', 'platform', 'release', 'one', 'where', 'movie', 'slowly', 'rolled', 'out', 'country', 'Warner', 'had', 'time', 'patience', 'opened', 'thousands', 'screens', 'simultaneously', 'were', 'just', 'old', 'generic', 'movie', 'Perhaps', 'will', 'find', 'audience', 'video']",N/A

Never a big fan of Jennifer Lopez, I was amazed at her effective performance as a tough cop (and yes, smaller people can manhandle bigger guys given the right training) who ten years earlier had turned her own father over to the police for abusing her mother, and then was made an outcast by the family when the mother and son took daddy's side.  Lopez conveys the sense of disconnection, hurt, and loss quite effectively.  Jim Caviezel (Passion of the Christ) is marvelous as the almost saintly stranger who risks his life to save Lopez.  From the opening scene of the movie, it doesn't take too long to figure out Caviezel's identity.  But the movie doesn't focus so much on that as it does on how hard it is to lose someone you love, either permanently or temporarily, as is the case for Lopez.

Unaccountably, he blames himself for this twist of fate.Personally, I don't quite buy into J-Lo as a cop but the movie rises above my reservations. And, after all, she is one tough Puerto Rican who seems to excel in both blue collar and princess roles, although she seems to be playing herself more than acting. However, she proved me wrong here.Then fate reconnects the victim and J-Lo in another sudden and deadly twist.Soon,  They find themselves drawn to each other,  being troubled souls looking for answers in their confusing lives. They enter into a  very unique relationship.This is a film about redemption more than anything else. Redemption as it relates to guilt and death and forgiveness. And it's also about a different kind of love that evolves out of torn souls who discover they share much more than each other's emotional pain, more so than typical romantic entanglements.The film ends on a positive and realistic note and avoids Hollywood pretense.Just like all redemption, however, a soul must be willing to embrace it and sometimes that's not always the case with those around us, especially family members.Surprisingly, this film is much more touching and profound than it leads you to believe on the surface, with unforeseen poignant moments.Quote:[Catch is staring at Sharon intently in the car]Sharon Pogue: What!Catch: Oh, I was trying to picture you without your clothes on!Sharon Pogue: [startled] Excuse Me!Catch: Oh, not like that, I mean I'm trying to picture you without your uniform, on your day off... with regular clothes.Quote:Sharon Pogue: You never said a word about yourself the other night, who are you?Catch: What's the difference!Sharon Pogue: What's the difference, you're standing in my bedroom, looking through my panty drawer, that's the difference, who are you?Catch: Somebody who keeps his appointments.Angel Eyes lyricsEvery heart that's been brokenby just a word that's been spoken.Heaven keeps the score...there's always something more,if only you believe.Angel eyes want to love youand angels fly high above you.The promise never ends.The rainbow never bends,if only you believe.",5,Fate and Redemption,1357344000,"01 5, 2013",2013,2848,"['Angel', 'Eyes', '2001', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'James', 'Caviezel', 'Jeremy', 'SistoRated', 'R', 'mainly', 'cop', 'violence', 'language', 'Tagline', 'Sometimes', 'accident', 'accident', 'ghost', 'story', 'police', 'story', 'most', 'unusual', 'love', 'story', 'more', 'thought', 'provoking', 'entertainment', 'traditional', 'sense.J-Lo', 'portrays', 'Chicago', 'police', 'women', 'who', 'troubled', 'family', 'life', 'personal', 'life', 'especially', 'father.Her', 'situation', 'bizarre', 'turn', 'one', 'night', 'duty', 'when', 'mysterious', 'male', 'victim', 'scene', 'brutal', 'traffic', 'accident', 'where', 'victim', 'wife', 'pre-school', 'son', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'car', 'was', 'driving', 'was', 'hit', 'head', 'nowhere', 'semi', 'Unaccountably', 'twist', 'fate.Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'buy', 'J-Lo', 'cop', 'movie', 'reservations', 'one', 'tough', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'who', 'excel', 'blue', 'collar', 'princess', 'roles', 'be', 'playing', 'more', 'acting', 'However', 'proved', 'wrong', 'here.Then', 'fate', 'victim', 'J-Lo', 'sudden', 'deadly', 'twist.Soon', 'find', 'drawn', 'other', 'being', 'troubled', 'souls', 'looking', 'answers', 'confusing', 'lives', 'enter', 'very', 'unique', 'relationship.This', 'film', 'redemption', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'Redemption', 'guilt', 'death', 'forgiveness', 'also', 'different', 'kind', 'love', 'torn', 'souls', 'who', 'discover', 'share', 'much', 'more', 'other', 'emotional', 'pain', 'more', 'so', 'typical', 'romantic', 'entanglements.The', 'film', 'positive', 'realistic', 'note', 'avoids', 'Hollywood', 'pretense.Just', 'redemption', 'however', 'soul', 'must', 'be', 'willing', 'embrace', 'not', 'always', 'case', 'especially', 'family', 'members.Surprisingly', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'touching', 'profound', 'believe', 'surface', 'unforeseen', 'poignant', 'moments.Quote', '[', 'Catch', 'staring', 'Sharon', 'intently', 'car', ']', 'Sharon', 'Pogue', 'What', 'Catch', 'Oh', 'was', 'trying', 'picture', 'clothes', 'Sharon', 'Pogue', '[', 'startled', ']', 'Excuse', 'Me', 'Catch', 'Oh', 'not', 'mean', ""'m"", 'trying', 'picture', 'uniform', 'day', 'regular', 'clothes.Quote', 'Sharon', 'Pogue', 'never', 'said', 'word', 'other', 'night', 'who', 'are', 'Catch', 'What', 'difference', 'Sharon', 'Pogue', 'What', 'difference', ""'re"", 'standing', 'bedroom', 'looking', 'panty', 'drawer', 'difference', 'who', 'are', 'Catch', 'Somebody', 'who', 'appointments.Angel', 'Eyes', 'lyricsEvery', 'heart', 'been', 'brokenby', 'just', 'word', 'been', 'spoken.Heaven', 'score', 'always', 'something', 'more', 'only', 'believe.Angel', 'eyes', 'want', 'love', 'youand', 'angels', 'fly', 'high', 'you.The', 'promise', 'never', 'rainbow', 'never', 'only', 'believe']",N/A

Sharon (J Lopez), the leading lady, is a lady-cop, tough but vulnerable, good-looking, but not eye-striking (thank God, the tasteless extremities of the Cell are over and forgotten), arrives at a scene of a terrible car-crash and tries to keep the last breathing victim alive (we keep guessing, who it is and what becomes of this person). Then, in a year's time, she is saved from a mortal assault by a handsome mysterious guy, Catch. Romance is budding quickly, but who he really is?Well, not a guardian angel, not a reincarnation apparition, not even a victim of traumatic amnesia. Actors and director keep beating around the bush, stretching patience to the maximum, while you feel irritation building: what angels have to do with all this mediocre mess?Whatever potential this flick had, vanishes into the thin air after first 40 minutes, degrading into mumbo-jumbo attempting to fuse together family drama, psychological thriller and banal love-story. Some ghosts from the past creep in and the viewers are dragged through all possible cliches while the characters deal them in with strained grimaces. Given the material, J-Lo does her best, while J. Caviezel, who's an undeniably gorgeous hunk (at least in Frequency he showed what he's capable of), shuffles around as a heavy-lidded sweating mannequin on heavy sedatives.

They are trying to sell &quot;Angel Eyes&quot; as a crime thriller, with some ads almost making it look like an emotional &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; type clone.  They could not be farther from the truth.  &quot;Angel Eyes&quot; is a gripping, honest, very original crime drama about the theory of predestination, and the effects of true love.Jennifer Lopez is flawless as Chicago Police Officer Sharon Pogue.  In the first portion of the film, we see her in action.  We see that she is a good person at her core.  She believes in her job, and she executes her duties to the best of her ability.  She is honest, yet tough.  Just, yet vulnerable.  Then comes a day when she becomes involved in a violent brawl and is rescued from a bloody execution by a mysterious stranger (Jim Caviezel).  From that moment on, their lives would never be the same.  As the two strangers meet, and eventually fall in love, dark secrets from their respective pasts emerge, and they are both forced to confront the pain that has left them unable to receive love for so long.&quot;Angel Eyes&quot; is potent and convincing.  Part crime thriller in the first half, to flat out drama in the second, it never once loses its grip on the audience.  Credit screenwriter Gerald Dipego and director Luis Mandoki for keeping the atmosphere dark and brooding when need be, and light and hopeful when called for.Jennifer Lopez gives what I think to be the best performance of her career, although her turn as Federal Agent Karen Sisco in &quot;Out of Sight&quot; comes a close second.  She is a true entertainer, whose appeal goes clear across the board.  She is flat out mesmirizing in this film.  Jim Caviezel proves yet again that he is a talent that is here to stay.  In the last year, he's played similar characters in &quot;Frequency&quot;, &quot;Pay it Forward,&quot; and now &quot;Angel Eyes,&quot; but in each film, he gives his character subtle details that make them a far cry from the one before.  He is a true actor.Some people are being put off by this film, and I'd once again have to blame the marketing department.  Why they think that people would only respond to the trailers of a crime thriller instead of the trailers of an intelligent, adult drama baffles me.

670011,A2VN986E5KR1NV,B00005NRO0,ProperGander News (Dr. Emil Shuffhausen),"[6, 7]","This fine film really snuck up on me emotionally, but the superb performances of Jennifer Lopez (Sharon) and Jim Caviezel (Catch) are rich, nuanced, and ultimately captivating.  ANGEL EYES works on so many levels ... suspense, action, drama, and of course, romance.  It intricately and sensitively deals with issues of life and death, loss, betrayal, and redemption.  The ending doesn't tie up everything in a neat little cliched package, either.  But aside from a wonderful script and crisp direction, the key to this film is the chemistry of Lopez and Caviezel, who can communicate so much from a look or a smile or tears.  Particularly intriguing is the character that Caviezel plays, the enigmatic Catch.  Is he dead or alive?  An angel or devil?  Is he psychotic or just deeply wounded?  Somehow, as the viewer sorts it all out, Caviezel plays Mr. Catch as a warm-yet-tragic figure who steals the viewer's hearts just as surely as he touches Lopez's Sharon.  Speaking of Lopez, this is one of her best performances; it's truly one from the heart.  She's gritty, yet vulnerable...tough, but gorgeous.  I'm not really a weepy type, but all I can say is that Sharon's amazing ""tribute"" to her father near the film's end had me getting embarrasingly misty-eyed. This is certainly a fantastic date movie; it really would not be appropriate for children or younger teens, however, due to some salty language, intense themes, and brief scenes of sensuality.  I am amazed that Caviezel didn't experience a superstar breakout as a leading man after this film, but it is without question a brilliant and heart-rending performance.

670015,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00005NRO0,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[3, 4]","This flick is better than it has a right to be.J-Lo is Sharon Pogue, a Chicago cop with some family issues.  The daughter of a wife-beater and sister of one in training, Sharon has little patience for those who are blas&eacute; about violence.  Sharon doesn't have much of anything aside from her PD buddies.  (They kid her, but let's be real, even as a fictional character, she still looks like J-Lo; whenever any of them start talking too nice, she gives them a quarter to call home).  Her comfy solitude is broken when she meets the mysterious ""Catch"", a laconic (almost catatonic) guy played by Jim Caviezel.  Saving her life during an arrest-almost-gone-wrong, Catch is too remote a guy to take advantage of the romantic possibilities...as quickly as the rest of us would.  Catch, we learn, loves jazz and toys almost as much as he could love Sharon, yet he remains distant from all three (keeping mounds of toys stashed in the junk draws of his otherwise empty loft).  Though Sharon's love can bring him back, we learn that Sharon's demons sidetrack her as well.  In the end, each will learn from the other how to love again.This was a nice flick, but not a great one - Jennifer Lopez (so I spelled her name out, so sue me!)  is the flick's best surprise, not letting certified-Diva status keeping her from acting decently.  She's so good that she single-handedly covers up what's missing in this flick - any real tension, or any sign that the flick is headed for somewhere or something.  Catch, we guess immediately, possesses a secret that's too painful to confront, but it's little revelation when we finally meet it.  J-Lo asides, the flick has no surprises, not even the generic and violent kind that you can whip up simply because Sharon is a Chicago cop.  The script stirs up a sort of supernatural tone with Catch's mysterious ways (he never closes doors; he seems fixated on his neighbor's young son) nor does much with its location (though Chicago blues infect the early part of the score, that ebbs away quickly, leaving nothing more than the patches on J.Lo's police jacket to remind us where this flick takes place).  After an ending that's too pat to be anything other than Hollywood, the credits roll, making anxiously wonder about when J.Lo will ever get a script that highlights her talents.  This flick was simply a J.Lo vehicle, but at least one she takes and drives away with.",3,Jennifer Lopez stands out,1039305600,"12 8, 2002",2002,2402,"['flick', 'better', 'right', 'be.J-Lo', 'Sharon', 'Pogue', 'Chicago', 'cop', 'family', 'issues', 'daughter', 'wife-beater', 'sister', 'one', 'training', 'Sharon', 'little', 'patience', 'who', 'are', 'blas', 'eacute', 'violence', 'Sharon', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'anything', 'aside', 'PD', 'buddies', 'kid', 'let', 'be', 'real', 'even', 'fictional', 'character', 'still', 'J-Lo', 'whenever', 'start', 'talking', 'too', 'nice', 'quarter', 'call', 'home', 'comfy', 'solitude', 'broken', 'when', 'mysterious', 'Catch', 'laconic', 'almost', 'catatonic', 'guy', 'played', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'Saving', 'life', 'arrest-almost-gone-wrong', 'Catch', 'too', 'remote', 'guy', 'take', 'advantage', 'romantic', 'possibilities', 'as', 'quickly', 'rest', 'would', 'Catch', 'learn', 'jazz', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'love', 'Sharon', 'yet', 'distant', 'three', 'keeping', 'mounds', 'toys', 'stashed', 'junk', 'draws', 'otherwise', 'empty', 'loft', 'Sharon', 'love', 'can', 'bring', 'back', 'learn', 'Sharon', 'demons', 'sidetrack', 'as', 'well', 'end', 'will', 'learn', 'other', 'how', 'love', 'again.This', 'was', 'nice', 'flick', 'not', 'great', 'one', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'so', 'spelled', 'name', 'out', 'so', 'sue', 'flick', 'best', 'surprise', 'not', 'letting', 'certified-Diva', 'status', 'keeping', 'acting', 'decently', 'so', 'good', 'single-handedly', 'up', 'what', 'missing', 'flick', 'real', 'tension', 'sign', 'flick', 'headed', 'somewhere', 'something', 'Catch', 'guess', 'immediately', 'secret', 'too', 'painful', 'confront', 'little', 'revelation', 'when', 'finally', 'meet', 'J-Lo', 'asides', 'flick', 'surprises', 'not', 'even', 'generic', 'violent', 'kind', 'can', 'whip', 'up', 'simply', 'Sharon', 'Chicago', 'cop', 'script', 'up', 'sort', 'supernatural', 'tone', 'Catch', 'mysterious', 'ways', 'never', 'doors', 'fixated', 'neighbor', 'young', 'son', 'much', 'location', 'Chicago', 'blues', 'infect', 'early', 'part', 'score', 'away', 'quickly', 'leaving', 'nothing', 'more', 'patches', 'J.Lo', 'police', 'jacket', 'remind', 'where', 'flick', 'place', 'ending', 'too', 'pat', 'be', 'anything', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'credits', 'roll', 'making', 'anxiously', 'wonder', 'when', 'J.Lo', 'will', 'ever', 'get', 'script', 'talents', 'flick', 'was', 'simply', 'J.Lo', 'vehicle', 'least', 'one', 'away']",N/A

And frankly, I don't, either.  But I am ready to admit that Jennifer Lopez can act, and act better than we usually think.  Just see her turn in &quot;Out of Sight.&quot;So, I watched &quot;Angel Eyes.&quot;  J-Lo plays a tough cop Sharon, whose devoting attitudes to her hard jobs and her honest character easily wins your sympathy for her, and also that of a mysterious guy named 'Catch' (Jim Caviezel).  'Catch' for some reason to be revealed later in the film, keeps on watching over Sharon in the similar way with the angelic Nick Cage in &quot;City of the Angels.&quot;  But, the initially supernatunal tone of the film is slowly changing into a more mature, slightly off-beat romance between these two characters.As you know, 'Catch' has some enigmatic past, which Jim Caviezel deftly realizes with his expressions of eyes.  Though he sometimes looks sleepwalking, the fact is that Jim is just acting to show that he is hiding something from Sharon, which is, of course, to be disclosed.But stronger and more impressive performance comes from Jennifer Lopez, whose character Sharon Pogue has left her painful past behind, and you will learn that it is related to her family.  When Sharon recollects one of her best memories before her estranged father, Ms. Lopez's acting talent is shown undeniably, revealing the tormented heart of the apparently tough policewoman.  That moment alone can deserve some respect for her.As a whole, the film has some tendency of chaging tones too much, making inconsistent movement from one scene to another.  You don't imagine a love romance between a secretive man and a female police officier right after your seeing a rain of gunshot from the gangsters on the street.  To make matters worse, the film, for all its good acting, shows actually little depth about the character of 'Catch.'  His 'secret' is sufficiently presented, but the film tends to rely on atomospheric presence of Jim Caviezel when his character should be drawn more convincingly with substantial materials.  How is he living?  Did he really forget his past?  His inside is too vaguely described for us to believe his magnetic personality.  That's why the origin of the name 'Catch' turns out disappointingly explained.As for Jennifer Lopez's character Sharon, she is a believable one enough for us to feel sympathy for her.  The film is brave enough to refuse to give a sweet, sugar-coated outcome about the father-daughter relation.  In spite of its film title, which suggests some supernatural aspect, &quot;Angel Eyes&quot; succeeds most in presenting this realistic view on family though it also gives moderately intriguing atomosphere between 'Catch' and Sharon.  But the latter part, I think, somehow fares less effectively, partly because no matter how an actor plays a mysterious person, he/she should be given a human side to the character.  Angel Eyes are surely enticing, but as far as the human's romance go, it is the personality that attracts the other people.
