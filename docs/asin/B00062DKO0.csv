As with any new dvd you have to be familiar with some basic yoga poses: mountain pose, downward dog, upward dog, plank, warrior, chair pose, foward bend, pigeon pose, triangle pose. so i didnt have a problem keeping up with this dvd. Rodney does alot of upward dog and downward dog poses in between wich i liked because it helped with warming up and developing upper body strengh.. so its a constant flow of moves. The only setback i have with this is he doesnt teach much breathing techniques, wich is vital to yoga. As a general rule, folding down you exhale, and coming back up you inhale. You will get very good stretching with his program. Also the setting and music are not distracting at all. I bought this dvd a year and a half ago , im more advance in my yoga  so i dont use it much now, but occasionally i will pop it in to maitain good flexibilitly.

The music is great and it has been filmed in Joshua Tree National Park so the scenery is beautiful.The practice includes; Sun salutations, Triangle pose, Pigeon and Backbend lunges, Seated, Wide angle and Foreword bends, Cobblers pose, Reclined twist and finally a great relaxation/meditation segment at the end.

You really need to know a bit about yoga (like the warrior series) before you do this practice.

Yes, the sun salutations are a bit fast, but is okay since this warms you up for the floor stretches to follow. He holds you in downward facing dog to rest, but I think the pace is perfect to warm you up quickly. It is a short workout of only 30 min., but perfect for those days when I don't have a lot of time. You will definitely get the flexibility on the floor postures after the warm up.I use Rodney's ""Power Yoga Total Body"" which I love too, but it is 1 hour.

Simple in production, long on substance, short on both instruction and new-agey faux-wisdom, these DVDs provide excellent replay value.""Power Yoga: Flexibility"" is a surprisingly short (25-minute) workout.  Set in the desert, the DVD features, as usual, Yee flying solo on his yoga mat with some telegenic scenery nearby.  Yee opens with several quick transitions through sun salutations before moving into some downward-dog poses and finishing with some sitting stretches (forward bends, pigeon, etc.).I had expected a ""flexibility"" workout to be both longer and slower - something more akin to Yee's hour-long ""Yoga Burn"" DVD (my current favorite).  But I have to admit, when you're finished with this workout, you will feel more limber than before.  Perhaps after a month or two of working this routine into the regular workout series you will really see the difference.I have only two quibbles with this DVD.  First, why is there no option for a longer workout?  It's not as if the DVD lacks the storage space.  Second, many of these poses are found in other Yee DVDs - indeed, there is very little here that is all that different from Yee's ""Power Yoga:  Strength"" workout.  Both involve sun salutations and down-dog poses - the differences are at the margins.  I suppose all yoga workouts improve your flexilibility, but I had expected a more unique workout.That being said, I still recommend this DVD given the main limitation - it's a 25-minute workout.

But he does lack the attention to the viewer and practitioner you'll get from Bryan Kest, for example. He doesn't talk to you or about your feelings and the poses are too quick in some places to do much good. A pose should be held about 12 seconds at least. You're in up dog about one to two seconds and must revert to down dog.Nonetheless, you get a good general physical workout and feel tenseness fade.
