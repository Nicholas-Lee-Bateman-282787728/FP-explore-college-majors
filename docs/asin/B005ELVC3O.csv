I appreciate the sense of wonder and hint of strange they try to convey.  I bought this collection for the size & price, and it was more or less what I expected  I guess, but noticeably uneven.  Not all of these shows were produced for the same broadcast program, so the approach is a bit different from episode to episode.  For example, one show treated Roswell with incredible skepticism, but another views crop circles with absurd credulity.  The ""Nazi Ghost Train"" episode must have been selected for inclusion on the title alone by someone who never bothered to view it, because while there may be some history involved, there's nothing mysterious about it (it was a Belgian train that was sabotaged so it couldn't deliver prisoners to German concentration camps; there's no unexplained phenomena involved at all).  Certainly ok for the price and affords a few hours of distraction, but hardly the pinnacle of the genre.",3,Iffy,1328918400,"02 11, 2012",2012,1041,"['do', ""n't"", 'take', 'short', 'History', 'Channel', 'entirely', 'seriously', 'anyway', ""n't"", 'why', 'watch', 'appreciate', 'sense', 'wonder', 'hint', 'strange', 'try', 'convey', 'bought', 'collection', 'size', 'price', 'was', 'more', 'less', 'what', 'expected', 'guess', 'noticeably', 'uneven', 'Not', 'shows', 'were', 'produced', 'same', 'broadcast', 'program', 'approach', 'bit', 'different', 'episode', 'episode', 'example', 'one', 'show', 'treated', 'Roswell', 'incredible', 'skepticism', 'views', 'crop', 'circles', 'absurd', 'credulity', 'Nazi', 'Ghost', 'Train', 'episode', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'selected', 'inclusion', 'title', 'alone', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'bothered', 'view', 'may', 'be', 'history', 'involved', 'nothing', 'mysterious', 'was', 'Belgian', 'train', 'was', 'sabotaged', 'could', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'prisoners', 'German', 'concentration', 'camps', 'unexplained', 'phenomena', 'involved', 'Certainly', 'ok', 'price', 'few', 'hours', 'distraction', 'hardly', 'pinnacle', 'genre']",History Classics: History’s Mysteries
