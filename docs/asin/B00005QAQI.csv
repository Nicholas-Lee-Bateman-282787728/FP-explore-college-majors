674363,A17S1450Y06C86,B00005QAQI,Aidan J. McQuade,"[1, 1]","The film is worth watching for bringing to wider attention the struggle of the Warsaw Ghetto fighters and the stories of those courageous people who resisted the Nazis in the Ghetto uprising. The casting of Hank Azaria and David Schwimmer as two of the leading fighters is quite inspired: their more familiar personas as comedy actors emphasises the fact that the uprising was forced on ordinary people who found themselves, through no fault of their own, in appalling circumstances.However the film does some disservice to the wider Polish community. Great play is made of Polish anti-Semitism as a reason that the Home Army did not give greater support to the Ghetto fighters. Appalling anti-Semitism certainly was a feature of much of the western world through the 20th century, including Britain and France as well as Poland. However Polish anti-Semitism is perhaps overstated in many analyses of the Second World War. Norman Davis in his account of the 1944 Warsaw uprising argues that the post-war emphasis on Polish anti-Semitism was, at least in part, an attempt by the western allies to exculpate themselves of guilt over their betrayal of democratic Poland to Stalin and decades of Soviet occupation. Gitta Sereny in her book ""Into that Darkness"" details the efforts of the Polish Home Army and the Polish Government in Exile to document and draw the world's attention to the genocide in eastern Poland.Roman Polanski, himself a Polish Holocaust survivor, saved by non-Jewish Poles, in his film ""The Pianist"" paints a much more balanced picture of Warsaw society during the war. He seems to recognize that celebration of the courage and heroism of the Ghetto fighters does not require blanket defamation of the rest of the Home Army, who at a later date also fought with enormous courage and sacrifice against the Nazis, and have also been forgotten by much of the world.",3,Almost a great film,1325203200,"12 30, 2011",2011,1881,"['film', 'worth', 'watching', 'bringing', 'wider', 'attention', 'struggle', 'Warsaw', 'Ghetto', 'fighters', 'stories', 'courageous', 'people', 'who', 'resisted', 'Nazis', 'Ghetto', 'uprising', 'casting', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'two', 'leading', 'fighters', 'quite', 'inspired', 'more', 'familiar', 'personas', 'comedy', 'actors', 'fact', 'uprising', 'was', 'forced', 'ordinary', 'people', 'who', 'found', 'fault', 'own', 'appalling', 'circumstances.However', 'film', 'disservice', 'wider', 'Polish', 'community', 'Great', 'play', 'made', 'Polish', 'anti-Semitism', 'reason', 'Home', 'Army', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'greater', 'support', 'Ghetto', 'fighters', 'Appalling', 'anti-Semitism', 'certainly', 'was', 'feature', 'much', 'western', 'world', '20th', 'century', 'including', 'Britain', 'France', 'as', 'well', 'Poland', 'However', 'Polish', 'anti-Semitism', 'perhaps', 'overstated', 'many', 'analyses', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'Norman', 'Davis', 'account', '1944', 'Warsaw', 'uprising', 'argues', 'post-war', 'emphasis', 'Polish', 'anti-Semitism', 'was', 'least', 'part', 'attempt', 'western', 'allies', 'exculpate', 'guilt', 'betrayal', 'democratic', 'Poland', 'Stalin', 'decades', 'Soviet', 'occupation', 'Gitta', 'Sereny', 'book', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'details', 'efforts', 'Polish', 'Home', 'Army', 'Polish', 'Government', 'Exile', 'document', 'draw', 'world', 'attention', 'genocide', 'eastern', 'Poland.Roman', 'Polanski', 'Polish', 'Holocaust', 'survivor', 'saved', 'non-Jewish', 'Poles', 'film', 'Pianist', 'much', 'more', 'balanced', 'picture', 'Warsaw', 'society', 'war', 'recognize', 'celebration', 'courage', 'heroism', 'Ghetto', 'fighters', 'not', 'require', 'blanket', 'defamation', 'rest', 'Home', 'Army', 'who', 'later', 'date', 'also', 'fought', 'enormous', 'courage', 'sacrifice', 'Nazis', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'forgotten', 'much', 'world']",N/A
674364,AQWCVDX13E6TV,B00005QAQI,"Alton Lomas ""waterdweller""","[1, 2]","The uprising in the Warsaw Ghetto was one of the few bright lights for the Polish Jewish Community in wartime  nazi-occupied Poland. It was a story of sacrifice, nobility of spirit, and undaunted resolve.Why this movie was ever made is beyond me, because it's a disaster in too many ways. In fact, it's so badly made and produced that it diminishes the true standing of the uprising in the ghetto as a monumental act of (ultimately futile) resistance. It's a character-driven film, trying to be epic in its portrayal of the historical events in 1941-1943, and while it touches on all of the clich&eacute;s normally found in a movie about this difficult subject, it does little with them except try to ratchet up the Hollywood drama.My biggest objection was the script's/producer's/director's/studio's reduction of a major event in the history of European Judaism to a ""social soap opera with nazis"", many of whom were played with tired exaggerated Prussian overtones. Jon Voight was particularly buffoonish as the evil General Stroop.The version I saw was ostensibly a streaming version of a DVD - but I realized pretty quickly that the continuity problems and apparent narrative inconsistencies were a function of it being a TV mini-series (with all the flaws that that implies). The breaks for station identification were incredibly obvious and disruptive, and the final scene ended without much resolution of the narrative threads previously introduced. Everyone died in the historical story, but that is inadequately handled in the version I saw. At best, the adaptation to DVD from TV was awkward. I did not see the mini-series on Television, so I don't know if the program was interrupted for advertising. I sincerely hope not, as it would be almost sacrilegious to break even a badly-made dramatic adaptation of this story in order to sell toilet paper and auto insurance. Nonetheless, the breaks in the narrative had that horrible ""and now for a word from our sponsors"" feel.The longer I watched, the more restless I became, as the production seemed almost to trivialize the sweeping events in favor of cheesy Hollywood dramatics. Moreover, the story of the Jewish uprising of 1943 (as opposed to the general uprising in Warsaw in August of 1944) is redacted and edited down, such that the activities of ZOB and ZZW are lumped meaninglessly together, and the confrontations with the Nazis (such as the battle at the loading station) suggest a great deal more meaningful opposition than there really was.This is not a story about a triumph of good over evil. We all know that, in the end, evil won out in the Ghetto, as it did in the larger city a year later. This is a story of resigned opposition, a struggle in the face of certain death. Perhaps the single greatest testament the Warsaw ghetto leaves is that the Warsaw Jews did not all walk in sheepish obedience to their deaths. That is the resonant message of this sorry chapter in history. This made for TV movie in no way does this inspiring episode justice.",2,A Tremendous Disappointment,1387238400,"12 17, 2013",2013,3023,"['uprising', 'Warsaw', 'Ghetto', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'bright', 'lights', 'Polish', 'Jewish', 'Community', 'wartime', 'nazi-occupied', 'Poland', 'was', 'story', 'sacrifice', 'nobility', 'spirit', 'undaunted', 'resolve.Why', 'movie', 'was', 'ever', 'made', 'disaster', 'too', 'many', 'ways', 'fact', 'so', 'badly', 'made', 'produced', 'true', 'standing', 'uprising', 'ghetto', 'monumental', 'act', 'ultimately', 'futile', 'resistance', 'character-driven', 'film', 'trying', 'be', 'epic', 'portrayal', 'historical', 'events', '1941-1943', 'clich', 'eacute', 'normally', 'found', 'movie', 'difficult', 'subject', 'little', 'except', 'try', 'ratchet', 'up', 'Hollywood', 'drama.My', 'biggest', 'objection', 'was', ""script's/producer's/director's/studio"", 'reduction', 'major', 'event', 'history', 'European', 'Judaism', 'social', 'soap', 'opera', 'nazis', 'many', 'whom', 'were', 'played', 'tired', 'exaggerated', 'Prussian', 'overtones', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'was', 'particularly', 'buffoonish', 'evil', 'General', 'Stroop.The', 'version', 'saw', 'was', 'ostensibly', 'streaming', 'version', 'DVD', 'realized', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'continuity', 'problems', 'apparent', 'narrative', 'inconsistencies', 'were', 'function', 'being', 'TV', 'mini-series', 'flaws', 'implies', 'breaks', 'station', 'identification', 'were', 'incredibly', 'obvious', 'disruptive', 'final', 'scene', 'ended', 'much', 'resolution', 'narrative', 'threads', 'previously', 'introduced', 'Everyone', 'died', 'historical', 'story', 'inadequately', 'handled', 'version', 'saw', 'best', 'adaptation', 'DVD', 'TV', 'was', 'awkward', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'mini-series', 'Television', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'program', 'was', 'interrupted', 'advertising', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'not', 'would', 'be', 'almost', 'sacrilegious', 'break', 'even', 'badly-made', 'dramatic', 'adaptation', 'story', 'order', 'sell', 'toilet', 'paper', 'auto', 'insurance', 'Nonetheless', 'breaks', 'narrative', 'had', 'horrible', 'now', 'word', 'sponsors', 'feel.The', 'longer', 'watched', 'more', 'restless', 'became', 'production', 'seemed', 'almost', 'trivialize', 'sweeping', 'events', 'favor', 'cheesy', 'Hollywood', 'dramatics', 'Moreover', 'story', 'Jewish', 'uprising', '1943', 'opposed', 'general', 'uprising', 'Warsaw', 'August', '1944', 'redacted', 'edited', 'down', 'such', 'activities', 'ZOB', 'ZZW', 'are', 'lumped', 'meaninglessly', 'together', 'confrontations', 'Nazis', 'such', 'battle', 'loading', 'station', 'suggest', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'meaningful', 'opposition', 'really', 'was.This', 'not', 'story', 'triumph', 'good', 'evil', 'know', 'end', 'evil', 'won', 'out', 'Ghetto', 'did', 'larger', 'city', 'year', 'later', 'story', 'resigned', 'opposition', 'struggle', 'face', 'certain', 'death', 'Perhaps', 'single', 'greatest', 'testament', 'Warsaw', 'ghetto', 'Warsaw', 'Jews', 'did', 'not', 'walk', 'sheepish', 'obedience', 'deaths', 'resonant', 'message', 'sorry', 'chapter', 'history', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'way', 'inspiring', 'episode', 'justice']",N/A

Although, I am not an expert on exactly that topic the film seems to cover the story fairly well. The heroic struggle of people who were outgunned and desperate against an enemy that would actually use the worst of mankind to terminate the uprising.A film covering both, German atrocities against Jewish AND Polish people together would not have been possible. The two hours normal length cinema movies would not allow a proper coverage of those two related and complicated topics.Some of the reviewers do not seem to grasp what this film and other movies such as The Pianist like to show: the human and inhuman dimensions. If people think that they can just point to the Germans as the bad guys, they did not get the point.Plus: some scenes showing German troops marching into the Ghetto were clearly over the top. If you like to see an excellent movie that portrays the Nazis' mentality, watch ""The Wannsee Conference"".What some people here forget to mention are all the Jews who served as ""Kapos"", policemen, that helped the Germans to gather all the Jews to be transported to the camps. Those ""Kapos"" are also shown in the movie.

Recreates the events of the Warsaw Ghetto uprisings of Jewish fighters against their Nazi murderers.Begins in 1939 with the bloody German invasion of Poland. shortly after which we see the Jewish population of Warsaw herded into the small cramped, ghetto, where they are subjected to exposure and starvation , and hundreds perish every day as a result of starvation and exposure. While others are daily shot and beaten to death by their Nazi tormentors. The uprising began after the  Nazi Germany's final effort to transport the remaining Ghetto population to Treblinka extermination camp. When the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising began on April 19, 1943, more than 300 000 ghetto inhabitants had already perished in the gas chambers of Treblinka.And was crushed by the Germans a month later who officially finished their campaign to liquidate the ghettoHank Azaria plays Mordechai Anielewicz, a leader of the Zionist-socialist youth movement Hashomer Hatzair and  Commander in Chief of the Jewish fighting Organization (ZOB). Who in this account is the man who spearheads the first acts of resistance and leads the uprising.  Azaria plays the role with force, charisma and conviction. The beautiful Lelee Sobieski (who had already distinguished herself as another notable woman warrior in Joan of Ark) is the primary star of the movie as the valiant and dedicated  Tosia Altman, who has seen her loved ones die and been shamefully humiliated by the Nazis.Other notable appearances are by Mili Avital as the ZOB ;leader and poet Devorah Baron, Donald Sutherland as the head of the Judenrat council Adam Czerniakow and Jon Voigt as the diabolical Jurgen Stroop , SS-Gruppenf&uuml;hrer Jurgen Stroop, who led the attack of the Nazi forces on the Warsaw Ghetto.My ONLY quibble with this film  is that if completely omits the role in the uprisings against the Nazis of the Jewish Military Union (ZZW) made up of righting Betarist Zionists.. The ZZW was formed at the outset of the Nazi occupation of Poland, and was in fact the first Jewish fighting organization formed in Poland, the first to become alive to the Nazi danger, the first to institute military training and secure weapons and the first to go into action. Not in fact as the film portrays Anielewicz,and the leftwing ZOB.The mainstream Zionist movement, after World War II, tried to downplay the role of the ZZW, in keeping with it's policy of ostracizing the Jabotinsky Movement, and the Communist dictators of post-war Poland, tried to overplay the small role played in the revolt by the Communists and Bundists, and to airbrush out of history the central role played by the ZZW, as this was reviled as a nationalist movement.Moist of those Jews who survived the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, including some of the key resistance leaders, moved to Israel, were their descendants still live today.Let that be a reminder to those sick and evil people who try to equate the Israeli Jews with the Nazis.Today Israelis are being abused and persecuted around the world and murdered in Israel and elsewhere simply for their existence as Israeli Jews, not for their deeds or opinions.The international fury against the collective Jewish presence in Israel certainly mirrors the rise of Nazism.If we can learn anything from the Holocaust it is to defend Israel and her people from the hatred and boycott, divestment and sanction campaign that inevitably leads to mass murder.",5,The Star of David rises against the yoke of the swastika,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,3461,"['Overall', 'thrilling', 'inspiring', 'moving', 'film', 'events', 'Warsaw', 'Ghetto', 'uprisings', 'Jewish', 'fighters', 'Nazi', 'murderers.Begins', '1939', 'bloody', 'German', 'invasion', 'Poland', 'shortly', 'see', 'Jewish', 'population', 'Warsaw', 'herded', 'small', 'cramped', 'ghetto', 'where', 'are', 'subjected', 'exposure', 'starvation', 'hundreds', 'perish', 'day', 'result', 'starvation', 'exposure', 'others', 'are', 'daily', 'shot', 'beaten', 'death', 'Nazi', 'tormentors', 'uprising', 'began', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'final', 'effort', 'transport', 'remaining', 'Ghetto', 'population', 'Treblinka', 'extermination', 'camp', 'When', 'Warsaw', 'Ghetto', 'Uprising', 'began', 'April', '19', '1943', 'more', '300', '000', 'ghetto', 'inhabitants', 'had', 'already', 'perished', 'gas', 'chambers', 'Treblinka.And', 'was', 'crushed', 'Germans', 'month', 'later', 'who', 'officially', 'finished', 'campaign', 'liquidate', 'ghettoHank', 'Azaria', 'Mordechai', 'Anielewicz', 'leader', 'Zionist-socialist', 'youth', 'movement', 'Hashomer', 'Hatzair', 'Commander', 'Chief', 'Jewish', 'fighting', 'Organization', 'ZOB', 'Who', 'account', 'man', 'who', 'first', 'acts', 'resistance', 'uprising', 'Azaria', 'role', 'force', 'charisma', 'conviction', 'beautiful', 'Lelee', 'Sobieski', 'who', 'had', 'already', 'distinguished', 'notable', 'woman', 'warrior', 'Joan', 'Ark', 'primary', 'star', 'movie', 'valiant', 'dedicated', 'Tosia', 'Altman', 'who', 'seen', 'loved', 'ones', 'die', 'been', 'shamefully', 'humiliated', 'Nazis.Other', 'notable', 'appearances', 'are', 'Mili', 'Avital', 'ZOB', 'leader', 'poet', 'Devorah', 'Baron', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'head', 'Judenrat', 'council', 'Adam', 'Czerniakow', 'Jon', 'Voigt', 'diabolical', 'Jurgen', 'Stroop', 'SS-Gruppenf', 'uuml', 'Jurgen', 'Stroop', 'who', 'led', 'attack', 'Nazi', 'forces', 'Warsaw', 'Ghetto.My', 'ONLY', 'quibble', 'film', 'completely', 'role', 'uprisings', 'Nazis', 'Jewish', 'Military', 'Union', 'ZZW', 'made', 'righting', 'Betarist', 'Zionists..', 'ZZW', 'was', 'formed', 'outset', 'Nazi', 'occupation', 'Poland', 'was', 'fact', 'first', 'Jewish', 'fighting', 'organization', 'formed', 'Poland', 'first', 'become', 'alive', 'Nazi', 'danger', 'first', 'institute', 'military', 'training', 'secure', 'weapons', 'first', 'go', 'action', 'Not', 'fact', 'film', 'Anielewicz', 'leftwing', 'ZOB.The', 'mainstream', 'Zionist', 'movement', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'tried', 'downplay', 'role', 'ZZW', 'keeping', 'policy', 'ostracizing', 'Jabotinsky', 'Movement', 'Communist', 'dictators', 'post-war', 'Poland', 'tried', 'overplay', 'small', 'role', 'played', 'revolt', 'Communists', 'Bundists', 'airbrush', 'history', 'central', 'role', 'played', 'ZZW', 'was', 'reviled', 'nationalist', 'movement.Moist', 'Jews', 'who', 'survived', 'Warsaw', 'Ghetto', 'Uprising', 'including', 'key', 'resistance', 'leaders', 'moved', 'Israel', 'were', 'descendants', 'still', 'live', 'today.Let', 'be', 'reminder', 'sick', 'evil', 'people', 'who', 'try', 'equate', 'Israeli', 'Jews', 'Nazis.Today', 'Israelis', 'are', 'being', 'abused', 'persecuted', 'world', 'murdered', 'Israel', 'elsewhere', 'simply', 'existence', 'Israeli', 'Jews', 'not', 'deeds', 'opinions.The', 'international', 'fury', 'collective', 'Jewish', 'presence', 'Israel', 'certainly', 'rise', 'Nazism.If', 'can', 'learn', 'anything', 'Holocaust', 'defend', 'Israel', 'people', 'hatred', 'boycott', 'divestment', 'sanction', 'campaign', 'inevitably', 'mass', 'murder']",N/A

674378,A10F5LMYPXQYDF,B00005QAQI,grerp,"[10, 15]","The story of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising is riveting in and of itself, and the director, Jon Avnet, couldn't ruin it entirely with his casting choices and historical inaccuracies, but it's a close thing.First off, the accents here are atrocious.  Not a single actor does the Polish/Yiddish accent well, but the German accents are terrible too.  I'm not sure why no Polish or Germans were cast, but the speech here is very distracting.  If you can't do it right, don't do it at all.Of the main cast only LeeLee Sobieski and Stephen Moyer have any presence.  David Schwimmer is entirely out of his league.  He should stick to comedy.  His hangdog face is perhaps suitable in the ghetto setting, but you still just want to smack it.  Hank Azaria is far too old to be playing Mordechai Anielewicz.  Donald Sutherland seems utterly non-Jewish (why do they have him bearded when Adam Czerniakov was clean shaven?), and Jon Voight fails to be convincing as a German.It's also clear that Avnet has an agenda with regard to the Poles. Not a single Pole in this movie, outside of the Jewish Poles, is likable.  The Polish civilians taunt or blackmail the Jews and the Polish Home Army turns its back on the ghetto in its hour of greatest need.  Also, in the interviews and commentary the claim is made that the Jewish ghetto resistence held out longer against the Germans than the country of Poland did as a whole which is factually untrue and misleading as well.  Poland was antisemitic, but there were Poles thatdid help despite the great risks they ran. The Polish Home Army WAS involved in supplying arms to the Jews and did offer assistance.  Poles were seen as sub-human as well and had no bargaining power with their occupiers, and Poland as a country suffered terribly under the Nazis.  Finally, there were plenty of unscrupulous Jews on the interior side of the ghetto wall, but very little mention of this is made.  The message: Jews, good; Poles, bad.What is good here is the action when it finally comes.  Uprising is well filmed and when the Jews finally face off against theirtormentors, it's emotionally powerful stuff.  Unfortunately, there is some inaccurate stuff here as well including some scenes in which, prior to the uprising itself, Jews take out groups of Nazis and then steal their weapons.This is probably worth a watch, but I wouldn't spend money to do it.",3,A mixed bag,1157932800,"09 11, 2006",2006,2373,"['story', 'Warsaw', 'Ghetto', 'Uprising', 'riveting', 'director', 'Jon', 'Avnet', 'could', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'entirely', 'casting', 'choices', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'close', 'thing.First', 'accents', 'here', 'are', 'atrocious', 'Not', 'single', 'actor', 'Polish/Yiddish', 'accent', 'well', 'German', 'accents', 'are', 'terrible', 'too', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'Polish', 'Germans', 'were', 'cast', 'speech', 'here', 'very', 'distracting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'right', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'main', 'cast', 'only', 'LeeLee', 'Sobieski', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', 'have', 'presence', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'entirely', 'league', 'should', 'stick', 'comedy', 'hangdog', 'face', 'perhaps', 'suitable', 'ghetto', 'setting', 'still', 'just', 'want', 'smack', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'far', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'playing', 'Mordechai', 'Anielewicz', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'utterly', 'non-Jewish', 'why', 'do', 'have', 'bearded', 'when', 'Adam', 'Czerniakov', 'was', 'clean', 'shaven', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'be', 'convincing', 'German.It', 'also', 'clear', 'Avnet', 'agenda', 'regard', 'Poles', 'Not', 'single', 'Pole', 'movie', 'Jewish', 'Poles', 'likable', 'Polish', 'civilians', 'taunt', 'blackmail', 'Jews', 'Polish', 'Home', 'Army', 'back', 'ghetto', 'hour', 'greatest', 'need', 'Also', 'interviews', 'commentary', 'claim', 'made', 'Jewish', 'ghetto', 'resistence', 'held', 'out', 'longer', 'Germans', 'country', 'Poland', 'did', 'whole', 'factually', 'untrue', 'misleading', 'as', 'well', 'Poland', 'was', 'antisemitic', 'were', 'Poles', 'thatdid', 'help', 'great', 'risks', 'ran', 'Polish', 'Home', 'Army', 'WAS', 'involved', 'supplying', 'arms', 'Jews', 'did', 'offer', 'assistance', 'Poles', 'were', 'seen', 'as', 'sub-human', 'well', 'had', 'bargaining', 'power', 'occupiers', 'Poland', 'country', 'suffered', 'terribly', 'Nazis', 'Finally', 'were', 'plenty', 'unscrupulous', 'Jews', 'interior', 'side', 'ghetto', 'wall', 'very', 'little', 'mention', 'made', 'message', 'Jews', 'good', 'Poles', 'bad.What', 'good', 'here', 'action', 'when', 'finally', 'Uprising', 'well', 'filmed', 'when', 'Jews', 'finally', 'face', 'off', 'theirtormentors', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'stuff', 'Unfortunately', 'inaccurate', 'stuff', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'scenes', 'prior', 'uprising', 'Jews', 'take', 'out', 'groups', 'Nazis', 'then', 'steal', 'weapons.This', 'probably', 'worth', 'watch', 'would', ""n't"", 'spend', 'money', 'do']",N/A

674386,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005QAQI,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[41, 42]","""Uprising"" is a story of the Holocaust that really could not be told until NBC showed this two-part made-for-television movie in 2001. The story of the Warsaw ghetto uprising has been told before. In the 1978 mini-series ""Holocaust,"" a major subplot had to do with Moses Weiss (Sam Wanamker), who becomes active in the uprising before being caught and shot by the Nazis at the end.  Other movies dealing with the Holocaust have touched on this heroic but futile act of resistance against Hitler's army.  This time, however, the point is to cast the uprising in terms that count for more than a moral victory.When Poland fell to Nazi Germany the city's Jewish population was put into a walled in section of the city, thereby creating the ghetto.  In the summer of 1942, after 300,000 Jews were deported from Warsaw to Treblinka the first reports of mass murder were heard in the Warsaw ghetto.  Mordecai Anielewicz, then 23-years-old, and other young Jews formed the Zydowska Organizacja Bojowa (Jewish Fighting Organization), issuing proclamations calling for the Jewish people to resist being sent away in railroad cars to the death caps, and firing upon German troops trying to round by Jews for deportation.The ""Uprising"" began on April 19, 1943, when German troops and police entered the ghetto and were repulsed by the fighters.  It is believed that less than a thousand such fighters held off the heavily armed and better trained Germans for almost a month, using mostly pistols and Molotov cocktails, but on May 16 the revolt was finally crushed.  Seven thousand of the 56,000 Jews captured were shot, and the rest were deported to either killing centers or concentration camps to be exterminated by the Nazis.  At one point the Warsaw ghetto consisted of 450,000 human beings.The point of ""Uprising"" is not only that for the first time somebody stood up against German occupation, but that some of the fighters did indeed survive.  Mordechai Anielewicz (Hank Azaria), Yitzhak Zuckerman (David Schwimmer), Tosia Altman (Leelee Sobieski), and many others depicted in ""Uprising"" are historic figures.  Azaria and Schwimmer obviously stand out, not because of the roles they play in the narrative but also because the actors are going to great pains to remind fans they are not just comic actors.  Also standing out are Sadie Frost as Zuckerman's wife, Zivia, and Stephen Moyer as freedom fighter Kazik Rodem, who wrestle with the hard questions of not only knowing what to do, but how to do it. Director and executive producer Jon Avnet has recreated the ghetto in great detail and makes full use of cinematographer Denis Lenoir and composer Maurice Jarre to make sure this television movie looks and sounds like a theatrical film.""Uprising"" repeatedly asks the question of how a moral person can sustain a moral code in an immoral world, and the uprising serves as the obvious answer.  Where ""Uprising"" is different from its predecessors is how Avnet recasts history to emphasize a sense of how the Jews ""win"" here.  Even though the Nazis will kill 99% of the Jews in the Warsaw ghetto, they did not get them all and they did not get them fast enough to please Himmler and Hitler.  Nazi General Jurgen Stroop has to endure being out thought and out fought by a bunch of rabble, all the way having his failure filmed by documentarian Fritz Hippler, who is working on ""The Eternal Jew"" because for some reason the Nazis do not find the German people to be anti-Semitic enough.  The Nazis continue to commit atrocities throughout this movie, but the emphasis is clearly on what the other side is doing.""The Grey Zone,"" which also came out in 2001, is of a similar mind in terms of presenting Jews fighting back, and depicts the October 7, 1944 uprising when members of the 12th sonder-kommando succeeded in blowing up two of the four crematoria at Auschwitz II-Birkenau. The sonder-kommandos were the ones who escorted their fellow Jews to die in the gas chambers, then took the bodies to the crematoriums, and disposed of the ashes. For four months the sonder-kommandos carried out their duties, and enjoyed certain privileges (compared to the other inmates), and then were executed. This group of Jews also decided to fight back and like those who resisted the Nazis in the Warsaw ghetto, deserve to be remembered.  But only once we have accepted the total horror and scope of the Holocaust can we tell stories such as these, ever mindful that they represent a minority report.  How many of you were stunned with a train full of Jews left Auschwitz in ""Schindler's List""?  The incident was true, but it becomes difficult for us to accept that other side of the story given the overwhelming death count of the Final Solution.The two commentary tracks are a mixed bag.  Avnet spends too much time commenting on the historical accuracy of the action and not enough talking about his decisions as a director, particularly with regards to what changes he had to make when his planned theatrical film was downgraded to a television movie.  Azaria, Schwimmer, and Voight recorded their commentary two weeks about September 11th, and engage each other to talk about the production and their performances.  Sobieski's comments were recorded separately and edited in, and like Avent, she has a hard time going it alone.  There are two documentaries accompanying ""Uprising."" ""Resistance"" is a too brief look at the history of the resistance movement in the Warsaw ghetto, although it does provide background on the characters and interviews with some of the surviving fighters.  ""Breaking Down the Walls: The Road to Recreating the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising,"" is a behind the scenes featurette with clips and interviews.

Overall I feel that the movie was very well done. This was not a documentary, I wouldn't expect all of the scenes to be ""factually correct"". Yes, I know that others suffered from Nazi oppression, however this is an heroic tale, and I feel that the spirt of the Ghetto uprising was well portrayed here. Having read two novels, and one factual account of the uprising, I think for the most part they got it right. My only objection was the scene in the Catholic church on Easter Sunday. There was no need for it, and I thought it detracted from the spirit of the film. Were the filmmakers trying to infer anti-semitism from the Catholic Church? Ah well, other than that, I loved it.

With some big names, and some surprising casting choices, I have to admit that I was very impressed with the movie overall.The story follows some young Jews who decide to resist the Germans in the face of numerous obstacles. Firstly, the lack of materials was acute, but interestingly they had trouble mobilising their own people and the Jewish community's leadership, who still saw hope of compromise. The impact of their scout finding out the final destination of the trains transferring Jews from Warsaw was significant, to say the least.I have to admit being surprised and initially sceptical about David Schwimmer, (having not seen him inBand of Brothers, where he was also very good). Schwimmer acted very well, and held his own with actors of great skills, such as Hank Azaria, John Voight, and David Sutherland. Overall, the acting was superb, in your face and without pretention.For a movie that is nearly 3 hours long, it sure did not feel like it. I was very surprised to see it end ""so soon"". It is a rivetting movie, that moves with the tragedy of it all. It tells the story of heroes who were basically ripped off by the local resistance, and still managed to give the Nazis something to worry about. It is hard to do that type of heroism and bravery justice, but ""Uprising"" gives it a decent shot.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and have watched it a few times.

The later event was hinted at in the historically-accurate scene which showed the Polish national flag flying from a rooftop alongside the Jewish Star of David flag. This was a deliberate decision by the leadership of the Uprising, who were largely members of Left Zionist youth organizations such as Hashomer Hatzair who believed that the fight against Nazi Germany was a common cause for Jewish and non-Jewish Poles.Some production details were bothersome.

So they build shelters and bunkers in the basements and cellars of buildings, often with tunnels that lead to other buildings; they collect arms and ammunition for battle; and they fight the Germans.  It is an important story for people to know; the acting itself is okay.  One question that repeatedly comes up is ""can a moral man maintain his morals in an immoral age (or at an immoral time)?""  Some of the most sickening scenes are those that show horrible propoganda films. I guess the reason I like the story is because I have always been horrified and sickened by the Holocaust and I get some gratification watching these people take on their evil oppressors.  I don't want to spoil the end but there are a couple of success stories told at the end.  Ultimately, the movie itself is okay but everyone should know the history of this resistance movement and how this small group of Jews were able to succeed against their much bigger oppressor and enemy.",4,can a moral man maintain his morals in an immoral age?,1169337600,"01 21, 2007",2007,1486,"['story', 'Nazi', 'oppression', 'Jews', 'Ghetto', 'Warshaw', 'Jews', 'rebellion', 'film', '1939', 'growing', 'list', 'prohibitions', 'regulations', 'leading', 'virtual', 'imprisonment', 'half-a-million', 'Polish', 'Jews', 'old', 'district', 'Warsaw', 'daily', 'struggle', 'hunger', 'disease', 'made', 'worse', 'when', 'Nazis', 'start', 'deportations', 'guidance', 'few', 'men', 'members', 'community', 'decide', 'have', 'die', 'will', 'only', 'do', 'so', 'fighting-they', 'will', 'not', 'die', 'passively', 'build', 'shelters', 'bunkers', 'basements', 'cellars', 'buildings', 'often', 'tunnels', 'lead', 'other', 'buildings', 'collect', 'arms', 'ammunition', 'battle', 'fight', 'Germans', 'important', 'story', 'people', 'know', 'acting', 'okay', 'One', 'question', 'repeatedly', 'up', 'can', 'moral', 'man', 'maintain', 'morals', 'immoral', 'age', 'immoral', 'time', 'most', 'sickening', 'scenes', 'are', 'show', 'horrible', 'propoganda', 'films', 'guess', 'reason', 'like', 'story', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'horrified', 'sickened', 'Holocaust', 'get', 'gratification', 'watching', 'people', 'take', 'evil', 'oppressors', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'end', 'are', 'couple', 'success', 'stories', 'told', 'end', 'Ultimately', 'movie', 'okay', 'everyone', 'should', 'know', 'history', 'resistance', 'movement', 'how', 'small', 'group', 'Jews', 'were', 'able', 'succeed', 'much', 'bigger', 'oppressor', 'enemy']",N/A

Survivors and/or historians will inevitably find flaws; war mongers would rather watch Normandy battle scenes; drama aficionados won't see enough heartache.  This movie is no exception.  As someone with a deep interest in the Holocaust, I can say that nothing, even touring the remaining camps in Poland, can adequately relate the experience to a layperson.  What impresses me most about Uprising is that it tells a story rarely told.  The Jewish resistance in Warsaw is one of World War II's ultimate tales of bravery, yet few people are even aware.  Kudos to Avenet for breaking the silence.Mordechai Anielewitz was a hero, and this movie sufficiently portrays that.  His rallying call, taken straight from actual correspondance, breaks my heart:  ""All we have is how we die.""  It's important to understand that none of the brave Jews in Warsaw thought for a moment that they would survive German aggression and rage; their decision was simply to march passively to their deaths in Treblinka or to go out fighting. A few chose the latter.  Even though there's no doubt after viewing this account that Anielewitz was selfless and care more about the perpetuance of Jewish honor than about his own life, I I wish this film portrayed his extreme youth--he was only 23 years old when he died in a bunker in Warsaw after holding off German advances and deportation threats for a month.The acting in this film is only so-so.  Hank Azaria is decent; David Schwimmer's accent is laughably bad (why bother?).  But it still has merit as a sample of the incredible stories stemming from the Holocaust and related angst--one of my favorites is the story of Dr. Yanush Korczak, a Jewish physician so esteemed by Germans that he was given a chance to escape certain death at Treblinka.  He declined, opting instead to accompany the dozens of orphans who had been under his care at a Warsaw orphanage.  He died with them in the gas chamber.Holocaust legacies are fading fast, and it's up to people like director Jon Avenet to aide in the preservation of history.  If this movie piqued the interest of even one apathetic person, I say his work is worthwhile.",4,A good primer--the best we can expect from network tv,1026604800,"07 14, 2002",2002,2204,"['Holocaust', 'movies', 'will', 'never', 'satisfy', 'everyone', 'Survivors', 'and/or', 'historians', 'will', 'inevitably', 'find', 'flaws', 'war', 'mongers', 'would', 'rather', 'watch', 'Normandy', 'battle', 'scenes', 'aficionados', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'enough', 'heartache', 'movie', 'exception', 'someone', 'deep', 'interest', 'Holocaust', 'can', 'say', 'nothing', 'even', 'touring', 'remaining', 'camps', 'Poland', 'can', 'adequately', 'relate', 'experience', 'layperson', 'What', 'most', 'Uprising', 'story', 'rarely', 'told', 'Jewish', 'resistance', 'Warsaw', 'one', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'ultimate', 'tales', 'bravery', 'yet', 'few', 'people', 'are', 'even', 'aware', 'Kudos', 'Avenet', 'breaking', 'silence.Mordechai', 'Anielewitz', 'was', 'hero', 'movie', 'sufficiently', 'rallying', 'call', 'taken', 'straight', 'actual', 'correspondance', 'breaks', 'heart', 'have', 'how', 'die', 'important', 'understand', 'none', 'brave', 'Jews', 'Warsaw', 'thought', 'moment', 'would', 'survive', 'German', 'aggression', 'rage', 'decision', 'was', 'simply', 'march', 'passively', 'deaths', 'Treblinka', 'go', 'out', 'fighting', 'few', 'chose', 'latter', 'Even', 'doubt', 'viewing', 'account', 'Anielewitz', 'was', 'selfless', 'care', 'more', 'perpetuance', 'Jewish', 'honor', 'own', 'life', 'wish', 'film', 'portrayed', 'extreme', 'youth', 'was', 'only', '23', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'died', 'bunker', 'Warsaw', 'holding', 'off', 'German', 'advances', 'deportation', 'threats', 'month.The', 'acting', 'film', 'only', 'so-so', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'decent', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'accent', 'laughably', 'bad', 'why', 'bother', 'still', 'merit', 'sample', 'incredible', 'stories', 'stemming', 'Holocaust', 'related', 'angst', 'one', 'favorites', 'story', 'Dr.', 'Yanush', 'Korczak', 'Jewish', 'physician', 'so', 'esteemed', 'Germans', 'was', 'given', 'chance', 'escape', 'certain', 'death', 'Treblinka', 'declined', 'opting', 'instead', 'accompany', 'dozens', 'orphans', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'care', 'Warsaw', 'orphanage', 'died', 'gas', 'chamber.Holocaust', 'legacies', 'are', 'fading', 'fast', 'up', 'people', 'director', 'Jon', 'Avenet', 'aide', 'preservation', 'history', 'movie', 'piqued', 'interest', 'even', 'one', 'apathetic', 'person', 'say', 'work', 'worthwhile']",N/A
