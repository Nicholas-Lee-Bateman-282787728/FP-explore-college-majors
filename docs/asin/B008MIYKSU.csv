1570434,AQ74866A320DF,B008MIYKSU,"B. Masters ""Army Retired""","[12, 12]","I grew up watching the Combat series on TV and it is amazing how many years ahead of its time it was.  It takes you down to the human level of combat during World War II - the street fighting, hand-to-hand combat, and stress involved in facing danger and death on the battlefield.  The acting is superb - they just don't make these nitty gritty type actors anymore.  These guys all know and practice their craft fantastically.  They make the most of the technology of their day.  A must for all military veterans and those who enjoy war movies.  Great value for the money.  Buy this series - you will not be disappointed.  Hard to stop watching once you start.

1570438,A1I5LC05HZJ9CF,B008MIYKSU,"Kanenberg ""50kmwalk""","[31, 37]","""Combat"" is a great show and the episodes on this disc are the cream of the entire series and I loved them all. The problem is it turns out I already own these episodes because they provide no description of what the 20 episodes are and all of them have already been released. IF YOU OWN BEST OF THE SQUAD, BEST OF NEW REPLACEMENTS, BEST OF ESPIONAGE, BEST OF HANLEY, BEST OF SAUNDERS, you already have what's on this set like I do. The seller is ripping off the public by not listing the episodes so I'm giving fans of this series a heads up. What you basically get is the ""Best of Episodes"" in slim pack form which is great--if you don't already own these shows and ok if the seller told us that's what your getting--but they don't. If your gonna buy this set--buy it from importcds like I did--they rock as a seller.",1,Combat is great--this item is a rip-off,1351036800,"10 24, 2012",2012,819,"['Combat', 'great', 'show', 'episodes', 'disc', 'are', 'cream', 'entire', 'series', 'loved', 'problem', 'out', 'already', 'own', 'episodes', 'provide', 'description', 'what', '20', 'episodes', 'are', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'released', 'IF', 'YOU', 'OWN', 'BEST', 'THE', 'SQUAD', 'BEST', 'OF', 'NEW', 'REPLACEMENTS', 'BEST', 'OF', 'ESPIONAGE', 'BEST', 'OF', 'HANLEY', 'BEST', 'SAUNDERS', 'already', 'have', 'what', 'set', 'do', 'seller', 'ripping', 'off', 'public', 'not', 'listing', 'episodes', ""'m"", 'giving', 'fans', 'series', 'up', 'What', 'basically', 'get', 'Best', 'Episodes', 'slim', 'pack', 'form', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'own', 'shows', 'ok', 'seller', 'told', 'what', 'getting', 'do', ""n't"", 'gon', 'buy', 'set', 'buy', 'did', 'rock', 'seller']",Combat!: Fan Favorites
