Most are wonder exactly what happened after krad pulled the wedge of time after the 6th dvd and this just ends it all. I wont say too much otherwise i will spoil this dvd to good fans, but if you must know the ending isnt exactly bad. There were a few scenes where I felt as if there were strong emotions flowing through me, but after that it was just heart warming. We get to see how Krad and Dark were created and learning the truth about the hikari's and the Niwa's deepest secrets. I was satisfied with the ending of how the relationship ends with Daisuke and Riku and as a bonus ill even tell you that there was a slight hint of two special people getting together. Over all this series was just wonderful overall and I recommend this dvd to all those who have previously watched the other 6.",5,The truth comes out!!!!!!!!!!!!,1123804800,"08 12, 2005",2005,874,"['Well', 'ladies', 'gentlemen', 'finale', 'd.n.angel', 'finally', 'been', 'released', 'Most', 'are', 'wonder', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'krad', 'pulled', 'wedge', 'time', '6th', 'dvd', 'just', 'wont', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'otherwise', 'i', 'will', 'spoil', 'dvd', 'good', 'fans', 'must', 'know', 'ending', 'isnt', 'exactly', 'bad', 'were', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'felt', 'were', 'strong', 'emotions', 'flowing', 'was', 'just', 'heart', 'warming', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'Krad', 'Dark', 'were', 'created', 'learning', 'truth', 'hikari', 'Niwa', 'deepest', 'secrets', 'was', 'satisfied', 'ending', 'how', 'relationship', 'Daisuke', 'Riku', 'bonus', 'ill', 'even', 'tell', 'was', 'slight', 'hint', 'two', 'special', 'people', 'getting', 'together', 'series', 'was', 'just', 'wonderful', 'overall', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'who', 'have', 'previously', 'watched', 'other', '6']",D.N.Angel Volume 7: The Light Breaks

913279,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B0009UV7F8,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[2, 2]","After returning from the world inside the painting, Daisuke goes back to enjoying his school break. That is until another artifact awakens and threatens to destroy the city. The Black Wings have awakened and it will take Daisuke, Dark, and Satoshi to stop it. This battle may take the lives of Krad, Dark, Satoshi, Saisuke, and everyone they love. The Harada twins are both in love with someone who could very well die in this final battle. Will they both get their lover back, or will they both end up alone? The ending to this story is emotional and very fitting. It's all that I expected from a good series like D.N. Angel.This series was up and down for me. There were some fairly unimportant episodes in this series. Some of which I liked, and some not so much. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack were all very well done. There were plenty of good characters and dramatic moments; as well as some light hearted comedy. D.N. Angel was a well balanced anime. It was a good clean show that is suitable for almost any age group. I would give it a PG rating. The ending in this series was a solid 5 stars. As a whole though, I have to give it 4. There was more potential here than was actually achieved I think. There was also a lot of wasted time. It was still a very good series though. I recommend it to anime fans of all ages.",5,A Really Good Ending,1356220800,"12 23, 2012",2012,1339,"['returning', 'world', 'painting', 'Daisuke', 'back', 'enjoying', 'school', 'break', 'artifact', 'destroy', 'city', 'Black', 'Wings', 'have', 'awakened', 'will', 'take', 'Daisuke', 'Dark', 'Satoshi', 'stop', 'battle', 'may', 'take', 'lives', 'Krad', 'Dark', 'Satoshi', 'Saisuke', 'everyone', 'love', 'Harada', 'twins', 'are', 'love', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'die', 'final', 'battle', 'Will', 'get', 'lover', 'back', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'alone', 'ending', 'story', 'emotional', 'very', 'fitting', 'expected', 'good', 'series', 'D.N', 'Angel.This', 'series', 'was', 'up', 'down', 'were', 'fairly', 'unimportant', 'episodes', 'series', 'liked', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'animation', 'voice', 'acting', 'soundtrack', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'were', 'plenty', 'good', 'characters', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'light', 'hearted', 'comedy', 'D.N', 'Angel', 'was', 'well', 'balanced', 'anime', 'was', 'good', 'clean', 'show', 'suitable', 'almost', 'age', 'group', 'would', 'give', 'PG', 'rating', 'ending', 'series', 'was', 'solid', '5', 'stars', 'whole', 'have', 'give', '4', 'was', 'more', 'potential', 'here', 'was', 'actually', 'achieved', 'think', 'was', 'also', 'lot', 'wasted', 'time', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'series', 'recommend', 'anime', 'fans', 'ages']",D.N.Angel Volume 7: The Light Breaks

Looking back on this series and knowing what I know now about whom these characters are and what their stories are, I can really appreciate what happened earlier in the series and really take in the gravity of what each event meant.In the end, the staff took a big chance with this story since there was very little indication that this story was going anywhere for the first half. The staff really had to trust that their audience would stick it out to the end and those of them that did were treated to a great ending. While it did manage to get stuck on a couple of clich&eacute;s and spots of poor writing, it did its job and gives the audience enough to feel satisfied. Definitely a series that will get a full replay from me at some point in the future and recommended.",5,Well Played,1213920000,"06 20, 2008",2008,833,"[""'m"", 'finding', 'pleasantly', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'right', 'now', 'Looking', 'back', 'series', 'knowing', 'what', 'know', 'now', 'whom', 'characters', 'are', 'what', 'stories', 'are', 'can', 'really', 'appreciate', 'what', 'happened', 'earlier', 'series', 'really', 'take', 'gravity', 'what', 'event', 'end', 'staff', 'took', 'big', 'chance', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'indication', 'story', 'was', 'going', 'anywhere', 'first', 'half', 'staff', 'really', 'had', 'trust', 'audience', 'would', 'stick', 'out', 'end', 'did', 'were', 'treated', 'great', 'ending', 'did', 'manage', 'get', 'stuck', 'couple', 'clich', 'eacute', 'spots', 'poor', 'writing', 'did', 'job', 'audience', 'enough', 'feel', 'satisfied', 'Definitely', 'series', 'will', 'get', 'full', 'replay', 'point', 'future', 'recommended']",D.N.Angel Volume 7: The Light Breaks
