980549,A1Y7C52533BA2H,B000EXZFOY,Blake Fraina,"[7, 9]","I stumbled across this film on Showtime, having never heard of it before.  I've always been a big fan of films about struggling rock musicians, despite the fact that most in this genre strike a lot of false notes - no pun intended.  SHOOTING LIVIEN, however, is the real deal.  This little film, filled with gritty, grotty New York locales and subtle, nuanced performances, is completely authentic.  It follows the burgeoning career of The Virgins Undone, a fictional NYC power trio fronted by the charismatic but deeply troubled John Livien.  Through brief, drug induced flashbacks, the viewer is given hazy glimpses into the childhood trauma at the root of his problems - conflicted memories of his mentally unstable mother, who fostered his early love of music and art, as well as his lifelong idolization of John Lennon.  Frequently addled by booze and drugs, Livien is vaguely disassociative, subject to frightening hallucinations and exhibiting strange, sexually inappropriate behaviour.  In situations where he needs to assert himself (e.g, when he is on stage), he hides behind affectations that mimic his idol, a pseudo-Liverpudlian accent and (non-prescription) round glasses.  Deeply mistrusting of women, he attempts to seduce every one he meets with an odd mixture of aggression and submissiveness.  The relationship between him and his mother and her tragic fate (a mystery revealed somewhat late in the film) has left him such obviously damaged goods, that the band's A&R; rep, one of his many conquests, (an impressively lowkey Ally Sheedy) observes, ""Whatever she did to you, she almost spoiled you for the rest of us.""The stunning Jason Behr is utterly riveting, completely believable and heartbreaking in the title role.  If there's any justice in Hollywood, he'll soon be competing with Billy Crudup for quality parts in intelligent films.  Dominic Monaghan and Joshua Leonard, as his bandmates, also turn in ingratiating, naturalistic performances. The dialogue and easy camraderie between the three men is one of the film's most authentic elements.  Last but certainly not least, the original music is head and shoulders above what usually passes for great rock and roll in films of this ilk (see the lame-o Sparklehorse  tunes in LAUREL CANYON as an example of the downside of this musical genre) and the songs sound quite credibly like the music of Livien's supposed main influence, post-Beatles John Lennon.I can't say enough good things about this one.  If you catch it, be sure to watch until after the last credit rolls so you are left with no doubts about an otherwise ambiguous ending.

But, I fell asleep on this movie. I was tired after work so I thought I would try watching it again the next day. This time I stayed awake, thanks to my husband pinching me,  but not even the fine acting and incredible body of Jason Behr could make me think this was a great movie.John Livien's a dark, morose miserable, confused man, haunted by the images of his mom who commits suicide.  His quest it seems is to find the tune to a beatles song his mom loved and to learn the words. Simple John play the  darn albums and find the song.  Maybe if he had stop doing drugs long enough and being miserable he could figure out his pain lies in his moms suicide and his fathers going on with his life. His propensity towards older women is understandable due to the lost of his mom at such a young age. But the scene where he kisses Ally Sheedy what was that.... not to mention that the women playing his girlfriend looks at least 10 to 15 years older than him. Although, the acting was good  why not find an actor that can sing, the story bleak, but a 5 star it ain't. And the reviewer who gives this 5 stars why? Slapping John Lennons image in  a movie doesn't a 5 star make.

A true independent film gem.  Great!  Yes, it's a dark and haunting story of a present day Lennon-inspired musician, but it's so-o-o-o much more than that.  Really loved the dialogue.  Loved the humor, albeit sparse.  Loved the hallucination scenes in bright primary colors while real life was in muted grays and browns.  Loved Dominic Monaghan's character ragging on Jason Behr's character about his Lennon impersonations, which were actually pretty good.  Jason Behr totally nailed his part, great performance.  Great nude scene at the wedding, very funny - ""It looks like the fantasy backfired.""  I'm still laughing.  Loved Fionn O'Lochlainn's music.  This is a movie I'll definitely watch a few times, which is the exception for me.  The dialogue grabbed me right from the start.  ""Before life, there must have been time.  And before time, there must have been God.
