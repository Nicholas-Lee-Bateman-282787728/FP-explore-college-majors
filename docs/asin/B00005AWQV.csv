579384,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B00005AWQV,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[4, 4]","That quote was also spoken in Quentin Tarantino'sReservoir Dogs (15th Anniversary). This is a reasonably moderate slice of blaxploitation that is apparently the pilot of a short lived TV series. I didn't know that at the time, but it makes a lot of sense now. It concerns the typically foxy, spirited black woman who, this time, is a cop. There is a small point of interest in that, because this was on television, it was probably required that she be a cop, that is, on the side of official ""decency,"" as opposed to being a street vigilante or average woman moved to take the law into her own hands. But be aware that that point of interest is not actually IN the movie.This movie does stand out a little bit because it was based on a novel, and as such it actually has characters, an attempt at a subtext, and a somewhat decent story. Christie is a hip and tough detective who portrays prostitutes in order to bring killers to justice. In her first confrontation, she seems terrified, and goes on a long time begging for her life before she finally karate-chops the guys'.....A... butt. Well, why did she wait so long? There is also a small point of scandal when a guy she refuses calls her ""ni$$er,"" and she come back with: ""Ni$$er lover."" And this was on TV!Eventually the story proper starts and Christie is deployed to get close to Helena, the girlfriend of a wanted drug dealer. There is a lot of subtext given lip service about how Christie and Helena share similar backgrounds and ""are the same person,"" but it is not developed at all. But Christie's character is surprisingly developed; she's very bold, sassy, in-your-face in a somewhat friendly way, and style. Teresa Graves does look like Whitney Houston and ironically Whitney was suppose to do the remake for ""Get Christie Love"" under Danny's Devito's Jersey films production in the late 90's, what happen after that nobody really knows.For those who are interested check out some of her clips on this site. [...]On the side Note: 'Get Christy Love' ran only one season, from September 1974 to June 1975 on ABC. Because of low audience numbers, the series went through an overhaul midseason when Glen Larson (Battlestar Galactica - Razor (Unrated Extended Edition)) took over as producer and Christy was assigned to a new gruff boss played by Jack Kelly. There weren't many notable guest stars seen during the series, but Graves' former Laugh-in buddies Arte Johnson, Jo Anne Worley, Judy Carne, Henry Gibson, Gary Owens and Johnny Brown guest starred on one of the January, 1975 episodes. Graves was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Leading Role for Get Christie Love.After the series ended, Graves costarred in several TV-movies (like the campy with David Niven 'Old Dracula"" aka:'Vampira') in the early-seventies. In the early-eighties, Teresa Graves receded from the spotlight and was rarely seen on screen again. She died on October 9, 2002 at age 53 due to a fire in her Hyde Park (LA) apartment. A faulty space heater sparked the blaze.

Yes, they were one in the same.Get Christi Love was not cancelled for poor ratings. It was actually because she found religion. Now, that's not a bad thing. But she said she couldn't do the sexy stuff or shoot bad guys anymore. That made it tough to do a cop show on TV. After that she did a few other things and then concentrated on her religion thing. It's to bad she left TV and a real shame that she died at only 53. She was the first African American woman to star in her own TV show. Hard to believe it took that long to get past that. If you're a fan of the 70s or can remember that far back, you will also see some familiar supporting actors. The DVD quality is not great and her career was just starting. It is the 70s too. But if you are a Teresa Graves fan, it's a must have. Maybe the TV show will come out on DVD at some point as well. I gave it 5 stars. Four, plus 1 because it's almost all there is of Teresa to see today. Teresa Graves was real class, beauty, talent and full of energy. In person, her presence could fill any room.

579389,A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,B00005AWQV,Phil S.,"[0, 0]","Seems like quite a step from JULIA (tv series), the first BILL COSBY show, to GET CHRISTIE LOVE (made for tv movie), in the slow progress to have an African American as prime time star - the latter showed a woman in charge, a strong, physical, defiant force, when ""smart and sexy"" was obvious and not repeated in the dialogue as a reminder.A good script has Harry Guardino, as the stereotypical Police Chief, playing against the very a-typical Detective, in hip-huggers; he pulls the eager young Love off the complicated case. Don't have to tell you what happens next - she manages to penetrate the pysche of a troubled woman, all mixed up in the drug world, but one whose photographic memory has been a great benefit to the drug lords.Guardino is stereotypical, as plotlines go, but there's a surprising twist in spots -he expresses interest in something impossible on TV as late as 1968 and still controversial after Feminism went Federal: something more ""social"" than occupational.There's a small subplot involving the making of a martial arts movie, and it seems the Director missed a chance to have Christie show off *her* skills, in that arena.
