Ceron ""Alacran""","[0, 0]","I think this is one of the best shows in TV, keep in mind that a profiler is merely a tool to the investigation, they don't really solve the crime like on the TV series, which are pure fiction, this DVD has the pilot episode and several of the best cases,.. is amazing how this woman can profile a criminal based in little details collected from a crime scene,.. it really is worth watching and owning this compilation of her criminal cases.",5,Dayle Hinman is the best.!,1253664000,"09 23, 2009",2009,441,"['think', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'TV', 'keep', 'mind', 'profiler', 'merely', 'tool', 'investigation', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'solve', 'crime', 'TV', 'series', 'are', 'pure', 'fiction', 'DVD', 'pilot', 'episode', 'several', 'best', 'cases', 'amazing', 'how', 'woman', 'can', 'profile', 'criminal', 'based', 'little', 'details', 'collected', 'crime', 'scene', 'really', 'worth', 'watching', 'owning', 'compilation', 'criminal', 'cases']",The Best of Court TV: Body of Evidence
880835,A15JFODPMUGF0M,B0007GP7UU,GangstaLawya,"[1, 2]","Dayle Hinman is a modern day Sherlock Holmes.  Indeed, Sherlock Holmes was a profiler who made insightful observations of crime scenes.  Arthur Conan Doyle was ahead of his time.  Hinman is well schooled from the FBI academy and applies her education well.  Although John Douglas invented the concept of profiling, Hinman has demonstrated herself as not only a brilliant practioner of the technique of profiling, but an innovator as well who developed profiling.  Like DNA, lie detectors and so on, profiling is just a tool to narrow down the pool of suspects.  With all of the boring, stupid, caustic television shows on tv, this show is one of the few remaining shows that makes watching tv still a worthwhile pastime.  My only misgiving is the cost of this CD.  Much too overpriced for the little material it provides.

Forensics/profiling is definitely not a career for the faint of heart.  She's uncannily accurate; she even guessed the type, make and color of a vehicle that the suspect drove.  Who does that?  I was disappointed that this was not a whole season, or series, worth of DVDs, but I took what I can get.  I'm glad TRU TV and other channels are playing this series once again.  I rarely watch reruns of TV shows, but this series I can watch over and over again.

The only cases I found her so called ""profiling"" at all effective in the ongoing investigation was the one about the two young girls who murdered the nude guy in his bedroom [duh!], and the son who was suspected of killing his mother until someone told Gale mom was raped during the murder.  C'mon.....this is CSI 101 for boneheads!!!!At least I got a few chuckles from observing the physical conditioning of a typical Florida cop.  With all their girth, I would be surprised any of these guys could even run a 100, let alone do it fast enough to catch a fleeing killer.My ""profile"" for Florida law enforcement in general.....FAT, FAT, FAT!  hahahahahaPerhaps it is a good idea that Gale is around as it seems almost all the suspects are either ratted out by friends or girlfriends, or actually turn themselves in.  None of these fat guys would ever have the nerve to claim ""solving the case"", so Gale might as well do it.The pretense of these shows is misrepresented in the first place.  FBI profiler, John Douglas, who perfected this craft had always stated that a profiler was never there to solve the cases.  Rather they are there to provide or discount possible suspects.Gale only did that in two of these episodes.

Dayle is a very likable person who takes her job quite seriously - you can tell it means a lot to her to get these criminals off the street.  She is responsible for helping the police to determine the ""type"" of person who would commit such crimes - including their ethnicity, age, educational level & personlity.This is one of those shows that I watch each & every week, as it never ceases to amaze me how the art of profiling works.  It's great to know that police now have this tool available for catching the ""bad guys"".Overall, I would highly recommend this DVD set to anyone who enjoys learning about the man or woman behind the crime, and the process law enforcement uses to get the criminals behind bars.",5,One of My Favorite Shows,1124582400,"08 21, 2005",2005,918,"['Body', 'Evidence', 'show', 'Court', 'TV', 'where', 'various', 'real-life', 'crimes', 'are', 'shown', 'discussed', 'beginning', 'end.The', 'particular', 'crimes', 'explored', 'program', 'are', 'files', 'profiler', 'Dayle', 'Hinman', 'Dayle', 'very', 'likable', 'person', 'who', 'job', 'quite', 'seriously', 'can', 'tell', 'lot', 'get', 'criminals', 'street', 'responsible', 'helping', 'police', 'determine', 'type', 'person', 'who', 'would', 'commit', 'such', 'crimes', 'including', 'ethnicity', 'age', 'educational', 'level', 'personlity.This', 'one', 'shows', 'watch', 'week', 'never', 'amaze', 'how', 'art', 'profiling', 'works', 'great', 'know', 'police', 'now', 'have', 'tool', 'available', 'catching', 'bad', 'guys', '.Overall', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'set', 'anyone', 'who', 'learning', 'man', 'woman', 'crime', 'process', 'law', 'enforcement', 'get', 'criminals', 'bars']",The Best of Court TV: Body of Evidence
880839,A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ,B0007GP7UU,Zoe Paris,"[5, 5]","This show is not for the faint of heart. However, I think it's one of the best crime shows ever. Criminal profiler Dayle Hinman talks about cases she has helped solve. The shows have good re-inactments, good crime scene and evidence footage and the show has good pace and doesn't lag. This show is very engrossing and I admit being addicted to it.It is true that Dayle comes off a little stiff (she reminds me of an anchorwoman) however, I think she has a certain intensity behind the outer phoniness. She is playing the phony Hollywood game where looks are important and this is not her thing and it shows. Her thing is solving crimes and it's easy to see that she loves what she does and is good at it. Not everyone is photogenic or great at speaking on camera but when she speaks of crime it's obvious she is one tough woman!Dayle has said in the show that she was always facinated by puzzles as a child and she sees a crime as a puzzle. I think there is something to be said about a person who dedicates their life to studying the most horrible of human behaviors to bring closure to the families of victims. If you are into crime shows and you like puzzles and mysteries you might enjoy this show! If you have already seen the show, the DVD quality is great.",5,If you like true crime you should check this out,1175644800,"04 4, 2007",2007,1263,"['show', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'However', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'crime', 'ever', 'Criminal', 'profiler', 'Dayle', 'Hinman', 'cases', 'helped', 'solve', 'shows', 'have', 'good', 're-inactments', 'good', 'crime', 'scene', 'evidence', 'footage', 'show', 'good', 'pace', ""n't"", 'lag', 'show', 'very', 'engrossing', 'admit', 'being', 'addicted', 'it.It', 'true', 'Dayle', 'off', 'little', 'stiff', 'anchorwoman', 'however', 'think', 'certain', 'intensity', 'outer', 'phoniness', 'playing', 'phony', 'Hollywood', 'game', 'where', 'looks', 'are', 'important', 'not', 'thing', 'thing', 'solving', 'crimes', 'easy', 'see', 'what', 'good', 'Not', 'everyone', 'photogenic', 'great', 'speaking', 'camera', 'when', 'crime', 'obvious', 'one', 'tough', 'woman', 'Dayle', 'said', 'show', 'was', 'always', 'facinated', 'puzzles', 'child', 'crime', 'puzzle', 'think', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'person', 'who', 'life', 'studying', 'most', 'horrible', 'human', 'behaviors', 'bring', 'closure', 'families', 'victims', 'are', 'crime', 'shows', 'like', 'puzzles', 'mysteries', 'might', 'enjoy', 'show', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'show', 'DVD', 'quality', 'great']",The Best of Court TV: Body of Evidence
