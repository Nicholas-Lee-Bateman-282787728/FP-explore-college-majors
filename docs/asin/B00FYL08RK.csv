Homsher,"[1, 2]","The fast forward is broken on my remote, otherwise I would have used it many times to get through the extremely hokey dialogue and plot situations.  Very little rang true in this film as every character seemed built on a cliche.  Too much time was wasted on setting up the father's death in  &#34;precious&#34; background scenes.  Much too often the various characters were drunk to no real purpose---or at least seemed to be drunk.  And what was  with the radical fairy--like woodland romp?  Puppet shows?  Filler, filler, filler.  And beaver milk cheese?---I couldn't see any city slicker being that far out of it.  Some reviewers lay the blame on the actors.  Although they were probably inexperienced,  I got the impression they could have done a lot better with some direction and a decent script---It seems to me most of the blame should go to the filmmakers---writer, director, editor etc. I felt a much better film could have been made from the basic premise.",2,Two stars for effort,1405468800,"07 16, 2014",2014,967,"['fast', 'forward', 'broken', 'remote', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'used', 'many', 'times', 'get', 'extremely', 'hokey', 'dialogue', 'plot', 'situations', 'Very', 'little', 'rang', 'true', 'film', 'character', 'seemed', 'built', 'cliche', 'Too', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'wasted', 'setting', 'up', 'father', 'death', '34', 'precious', '34', 'background', 'scenes', 'Much', 'too', 'often', 'various', 'characters', 'were', 'drunk', 'real', 'purpose', 'least', 'seemed', 'be', 'drunk', 'what', 'was', 'radical', 'fairy', 'woodland', 'romp', 'Puppet', 'shows', 'Filler', 'filler', 'filler', 'beaver', 'milk', 'cheese', '-I', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'city', 'slicker', 'being', 'far', 'reviewers', 'lay', 'blame', 'actors', 'were', 'probably', 'inexperienced', 'got', 'impression', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'lot', 'better', 'direction', 'decent', 'script', '-It', 'most', 'blame', 'should', 'go', 'filmmakers', '-writer', 'director', 'editor', 'etc', 'felt', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'basic', 'premise']",Leather
1673723,A20R44GC750MIO,B00FYL08RK,"Michael Soros ""bronzebus34""","[1, 2]",I've given this film three stars (it's Ok) as the film is borderline ok. The one redeeming feature of the film is the plot. It is a very good story and in the hands of the right director/producer/actors it could be a hit. Unfortunately none of these apply to this production. The plot is outlined in great detail by another reviewer as are the flaws - a review with which I concur wholeheartedly.I don't know who these actors are and I hope it is their first tentative steps into the world of acting. If not I suggest they try another profession because they are never going to convince anyone they can act. I have no idea how the boyfriend with the rabbit ever got chosen for this role. He seriously cannot act and I doubt that he got the role after a long and rigorous auditioning. I assume he owned the camera or gave some funding but anyone off the street could have acted better - or in this case just read the words off the page.The two main actors around which the story is set are less wooden as their arms and legs move but they still are not really carrying the film. You can see them 'act'.The story seriously misses a sub-plot. As there is only one story the three actors have to try carry it and us along. They fail to do that and a little bit of distraction would have been welcome. I thought we learned too little about the father and a subplot could have been a woman who was in love with him and who reveals his past in flashbacks. Anything really to lighten the mood. The nearest the film came to breaking through was the puppeteer. She was good - if not the best actress (if indeed she was as actress) but she added much needed breaks to the other three. The problem however was that her puppet therapy pieces in the film do not go on long enough to warrant the reactions they get from the actors. They should have been longer and possibly a lot more subtle. Just having puppets blurt out bluntly that your father hated you and dumped you out of the house 10 years ago doesn't leave much to the imagination.Birch was passable as an actor but seemed just too relaxed considering he was going to be turfed out of his house. He was also writing dodgy cheques using the father's forged signature. That isn't addressed in the plot. Although the credits list a 'leather work advisor' it would appear that making a pair of sandals in a couple of minutes is the norm. I suspect at least a day or two would be the norm. I know it has to be condensed for the film but leather work is time consuming and smells. That was ignored.Overall the plot was strong and was worth watching just for that. The acting was terrible with not one experienced or strong actor to carry the film. It needed a sub-plot to tell us more back story about the father and his relationship with Birch who managed to remain immaculately dressed in the middle of a forest or in a workshop by the way. Watch it if you get the opportunity and hopefully someone will buy the script and re shoot the film.,3,Good plot acted badly.,1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,2982,"[""'ve"", 'given', 'film', 'three', 'stars', 'Ok', 'film', 'borderline', 'ok', 'one', 'redeeming', 'feature', 'film', 'plot', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'hands', 'right', 'director/producer/actors', 'could', 'be', 'hit', 'Unfortunately', 'none', 'apply', 'production', 'plot', 'outlined', 'great', 'detail', 'reviewer', 'are', 'flaws', 'review', 'concur', 'wholeheartedly.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'actors', 'are', 'hope', 'first', 'tentative', 'steps', 'world', 'acting', 'not', 'suggest', 'try', 'profession', 'are', 'never', 'going', 'convince', 'anyone', 'can', 'act', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'boyfriend', 'rabbit', 'ever', 'got', 'chosen', 'role', 'seriously', 'can', 'not', 'act', 'doubt', 'got', 'role', 'long', 'rigorous', 'auditioning', 'assume', 'owned', 'camera', 'gave', 'funding', 'anyone', 'street', 'could', 'have', 'acted', 'better', 'case', 'just', 'read', 'words', 'page.The', 'two', 'main', 'actors', 'story', 'set', 'are', 'less', 'wooden', 'arms', 'legs', 'move', 'still', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'carrying', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'story', 'seriously', 'sub-plot', 'only', 'one', 'story', 'three', 'actors', 'have', 'try', 'carry', 'along', 'fail', 'do', 'little', 'bit', 'distraction', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'welcome', 'thought', 'learned', 'too', 'little', 'father', 'subplot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'love', 'who', 'past', 'flashbacks', 'Anything', 'really', 'lighten', 'mood', 'nearest', 'film', 'came', 'breaking', 'was', 'puppeteer', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'best', 'actress', 'indeed', 'was', 'actress', 'added', 'much', 'needed', 'breaks', 'other', 'three', 'problem', 'however', 'was', 'puppet', 'therapy', 'pieces', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'long', 'enough', 'warrant', 'reactions', 'get', 'actors', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'longer', 'possibly', 'lot', 'more', 'subtle', 'Just', 'having', 'puppets', 'blurt', 'out', 'bluntly', 'father', 'hated', 'dumped', 'house', '10', 'years', 'ago', ""n't"", 'leave', 'much', 'imagination.Birch', 'was', 'passable', 'actor', 'seemed', 'just', 'too', 'relaxed', 'considering', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'turfed', 'house', 'was', 'also', 'writing', 'dodgy', 'cheques', 'using', 'father', 'forged', 'signature', ""n't"", 'addressed', 'plot', 'credits', 'list', ""'leather"", 'work', 'advisor', 'would', 'appear', 'making', 'pair', 'sandals', 'couple', 'minutes', 'norm', 'suspect', 'least', 'day', 'two', 'would', 'be', 'norm', 'know', 'be', 'condensed', 'film', 'leather', 'work', 'time', 'consuming', 'smells', 'was', 'ignored.Overall', 'plot', 'was', 'strong', 'was', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'acting', 'was', 'terrible', 'not', 'one', 'experienced', 'strong', 'actor', 'carry', 'film', 'needed', 'sub-plot', 'tell', 'more', 'back', 'story', 'father', 'relationship', 'Birch', 'who', 'managed', 'remain', 'immaculately', 'dressed', 'middle', 'forest', 'workshop', 'way', 'Watch', 'get', 'opportunity', 'hopefully', 'someone', 'will', 'buy', 'script', 're', 'shoot', 'film']",Leather
1673724,A2KARIOEGE27DW,B00FYL08RK,"MountainMan ""David""","[0, 4]","The &#8220;1970&#8217;s aesthetic&#8221; (quoted from the synopsis) this film attempts to produce takes some getting use to.At first I thought the director may have been trying to use the &#8220;screen-door effect&#8221; as a historical time element (looking through a screen door = past) but this is evident, off and on, throughout the entire film. Are the constant amateur attempts to keep the cameras focused also part of the aesthetic? In one of the first opening scenes, the main character, Birch (Chris Graham &#8220;All That Glitters&#8221; - 2010 (demo reel of his 2013 films on imdb, check it out!)) is seen cutting leather (as we find out later, in order to make sandals) but the camera continually loses focus jumping from close-up of the leather to close-up of his hands, arms, etc. It is very distracting, even annoying, at the beginning of a movie.Putting aside these production items, this is a story about a man who lives with an older man in a log cabin located somewhere in the Catskills. During the opening we see kids playing with a young, bearded man. Fast forward to the preset and we see Birch taking care of a man old enough to be his father who is sick and dying. We also briefly see an equally older woman taking care of the older man. We then see Birch setting up the older man&#8217;s gravestone and thanking him with a toast of bottle of booze and a shot glass.Birch has clothes out of &#8220;Little House on the Prairie;&#8221; a cleanly, well-dressed, suspendered and bearded mountain-man but when you observe him walking, it appears as if he has spent all of 5 minutes in the mountain as he carefully steps over branches and rocks, avoiding all obstacles.We then see him being intimate (not sexual) with a young woman named Stacy (Sara Jecko) who seriously over-acts. It is not revealed if she is his girlfriend or wife but there is definite love between them. There is very loud &#8220;back-woods folk&#8221; guitar music playing that makes it extremely difficult to hear what the couple says to each other. Although this music continues throughout the opening scenes, fortunately it eventually fades so we can hear the main characters. I don&#8217;t think it needed to be as loud to prove a point. In fact, shortly thereafter Birch asks Kyle (played by Jeremy Neal) to turn it off so they can hear each other talk.Cut to New York where we meet 2 young men, 1 (Andrew, played by Andrew Glaszek) an obvious gym bunny and his boyfriend Kyle who is just a bunny (read: flamboyant, bitchy, rude and just as annoying as the loud music) twink who has pierced nips and a rabbit wrapped in some kind of crocheted blanket. We never find out why he is so attached to the rabbit but it is symbolic as revealed later in the film. They have a mutual female friend who plays the &#8220;girlfriend&#8221; part to a T with extreme over-acting. It appears that Kyle is just as much attached to her as he is to his cellphone and rabbit. They keep him too busy to really discover who he is or what he wants out of life.As the 2 NY guys drive along in the car, the camera scans, not the countryside but the sky and when they pass trees, the camera again blurs. Is this 1970&#8217;s aesthetic or just plain bad photography?All characters were very careful to recite the horrible script word for word. The only emotion was obviously faked. It was very difficult for me to retain interest in the first 40 minutes.We come to find out that Andrew is the son of the man who Birch has been living with and that Birch and Andrew use to be boyhood friends. Andrew had a crush on Birch in high school. Birch left the city life and loves his connection with all things nature, fishing, hunting, drinking, getting together with like-minded country neighbors, urinating outside and swimming nude. When Andrew finally tells him about how he has always felt toward Birch, Birch reminds Andrew that he already has a boyfriend (Kyle). Andrew attempts to find out how Birch feels but Birch does not believe in labeling (gay, straight, etc.) love. Kyle thinks Birch is hot but also thinks Birch killed Andrew&#8217;s father.Then there is this big outdoor mountain party with all sorts of &#8220;down-home&#8221; mountain characters drinking and smoking dope and 1 woman (May, played by Glenda Lauten) who does a puppet play about Andrew coming out to his father and the argument that ensued between them. The only way she could have known about that is if Birch told her so Andrew fights with Birch. Well, as we all know, 2 guys fighting together is one of the best ways for males to become friends and bond so in a future scene, after they drink a bottle of &#8220;Harvey&#8217;s Wonder Tonic&#8221; we see the two wearing antlers on their heads with leaf necklaces tied around their necks, frolicking in the woods and bushes. After some talk, Birch has a very brief frontal nude urination scene and then he strips and jumps nude in the lake and convinces Andrew to follow (in his boxers). The picture on the main page here that you see of them lying in the field is taken after the swim and they are both nude (rear only). There is also rear nudity when Andrew and Kyle made very tender love earlier in the film. Unfortunately, the scene with Birch listening from the next room as they did so, was accompanied by disgustingly-fake sexual vocalizations that seriously degraded this film.While Andrew and Birch were dancing with antlers on their heads, Kyle and May were drinking wine and smoking dope (irony that Kyle would make friends with the same woman that just reveled Andrew&#8217;s past to everyone!) and when Kyle started to sober up, realized that his boyfriend had stayed out all night and Kyle began to obsess. Evidently, the rabbit liked to stay outside as well. The rabbit and Andrew both liked the wild woods! So we see Kyle going off about loosing both of them. Another example of a way over-acted and very bad over-dramatized part, none of which was believable.At about 1:23 of the 1:41 movie, it started to pixelate. I pulled out the DVD and saw no dirt or scratches (the DVD was in the original sealed case and the DVD was not loosed in shipment) but I did the standard cleaning thing anyway. Putting it back in and selecting the last scene, it still pixelated but cleared after a minute and a half running so I could watch the abrupt and rather unbelievable ending titled &#8220;Resolution.&#8221;This &#8220;resolution&#8221; does clear up some previous questions the movie raised. It also presents a stark contrast between the perceived need for modern technology and the real need to be freed from old definitions of romantic love.",2,Might be worth it if you can make it past 40
