701082,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00006684S,A Customer,"[0, 2]","Summary:Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) and Sarah Altman (Kristen Stewart) have just decided on a massive new house to move into following Meg's divorce from her extremely wealthy husband, Stephen Altman (Patrick Bauchau).  On their tour of the house the real estate agent shows them one of the perks of a house so big and expensive - the panic room.  The room is supposed to be impenetrable and allow the occupants safety while emergency personnel arrive in case of any troubles.During their first night in the home three burglars break in, Burnham (Forest Whitaker), Raoul (Dwight Yoakam), and Junior (Jared Leto).  What Meg and Sarah don't realize is that the burglars are not after them but after what the previous occupant left in the panic room - several million dollars.Meg and Sarah make it to the panic room and are able to seal themselves in before they are caught, leading the burglars to attempt numerous ways to crack the defenses of the panic room.  All of the plans are devised by Burnham, who happens to be the person who designed the room.Meg and Sarah probably would have been fine if it didn't so happen that Sarah is a diabetic and forgot to bring her insulin, etc.  Eventually Meg has to break her way out to get the insulin, but in the process gets locked out with the burglars locked in with her daughter.  Sarah gets her insulin, but Meg is on the outside.  The only plus is that Raoul dropped his gun in the scuffle and now Meg has it.Eventually the burglars find what they are looking for and try to get away, but Raoul and Meg don't plan on making it that easy.  Raoul knows that the Altman's have seen his face and now he wants to kill them.  Meg still doesn't know exactly what the burglars were after, but she isn't very happen with them and wants to catch them.  In the end Raoul, who happens to be the sociopath of the group, nearly kills the Altmans except Burnham intervenes and kills him instead.  The Altmans survive and the millions of dollars hidden in the panic room are lost when Burnham is captured by the police.My Comments:The major problem with this movie is how contrived the story is.  First, Burnham has access to a bunch of information about the house and is supposed to know that no one has moved in, but for some reason Meg and Sarah moved in early and he wasn't aware of it.  Second, when given the chance to notify the police, Meg decides not too (this is really what did it for me, at this point I lost all respect for the movie).  If she had notified the police then the movie would have ended before a final confrontation could take place, and of course that can't happen.  Third, Sarah has diabetes?  Come on!  The only reason for this coincidence is so Meg has to leave.  And last, Meg thinks she can take on two beefy men, one of whom is a sociopath that doesn't mind killing people?  Give me a break.  I can understand some suspension of belief in movies that require it, but this was just pushing things much further than I was willing to go and is the reason that I rated the movie as low as I did.What about the acting?  Well, it isn't actually too bad.  Jodie Foster did pretty good with what she had to work with.  The rest of the cast was also pretty good.  I'm actually quite impressed with Dwight Yoakam who seems to be finding a niche for himself as a villain (Sling Blade).  The only person I really had a problem with was Junior - he was just too much the overly stereotypical, rich spoiled kid, blah, blah.  Otherwise, the acting isn't too bad.Overall, I just couldn't bring myself to give this movie a good rating because I kept thinking about how silly the plot reversals were.  Anybody with half a brain would have done things dramatically different and there were just too many coincidences to make this a believable film.  I should also note that despite trying to make the movie tense, it isn't really all that 'on the edge of your seat' thrilling.  Anyway, it's an okay film if you can give the characters a lot of leeway for the really stupid decisions they make and the number of coincidences that take place.  I don't think I would recommend it, but some people may like it.",2,"Other than being horribly contrived, kind of interesting",1059955200,"08 4, 2003",2003,4149,"['Summary', 'Meg', 'Altman', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Sarah', 'Altman', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'have', 'just', 'decided', 'massive', 'new', 'house', 'move', 'following', 'Meg', 'divorce', 'extremely', 'wealthy', 'husband', 'Stephen', 'Altman', 'Patrick', 'Bauchau', 'tour', 'house', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'one', 'perks', 'house', 'so', 'big', 'expensive', 'panic', 'room', 'room', 'supposed', 'be', 'impenetrable', 'allow', 'occupants', 'safety', 'emergency', 'personnel', 'arrive', 'case', 'troubles.During', 'first', 'night', 'home', 'three', 'burglars', 'break', 'Burnham', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Raoul', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'Junior', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'What', 'Meg', 'Sarah', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'burglars', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'previous', 'occupant', 'left', 'panic', 'room', 'several', 'million', 'dollars.Meg', 'Sarah', 'make', 'panic', 'room', 'are', 'able', 'seal', 'are', 'caught', 'leading', 'burglars', 'attempt', 'numerous', 'ways', 'crack', 'defenses', 'panic', 'room', 'plans', 'are', 'devised', 'Burnham', 'who', 'be', 'person', 'who', 'designed', 'room.Meg', 'Sarah', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'did', ""n't"", 'so', 'happen', 'Sarah', 'diabetic', 'forgot', 'bring', 'insulin', 'etc', 'Eventually', 'Meg', 'break', 'way', 'get', 'insulin', 'process', 'locked', 'out', 'burglars', 'locked', 'daughter', 'Sarah', 'insulin', 'Meg', 'outside', 'only', 'Raoul', 'dropped', 'gun', 'scuffle', 'now', 'Meg', 'it.Eventually', 'burglars', 'find', 'what', 'are', 'looking', 'try', 'get', 'away', 'Raoul', 'Meg', 'do', ""n't"", 'plan', 'making', 'easy', 'Raoul', 'Altman', 'have', 'seen', 'face', 'now', 'kill', 'Meg', 'still', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'burglars', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'happen', 'catch', 'end', 'Raoul', 'who', 'be', 'sociopath', 'group', 'nearly', 'Altmans', 'Burnham', 'intervenes', 'instead', 'Altmans', 'survive', 'millions', 'dollars', 'hidden', 'panic', 'room', 'are', 'lost', 'when', 'Burnham', 'captured', 'police.My', 'Comments', 'major', 'problem', 'movie', 'how', 'contrived', 'story', 'First', 'Burnham', 'access', 'bunch', 'information', 'house', 'supposed', 'know', 'one', 'moved', 'reason', 'Meg', 'Sarah', 'moved', 'early', 'was', ""n't"", 'aware', 'Second', 'when', 'given', 'chance', 'notify', 'police', 'Meg', 'not', 'too', 'really', 'what', 'did', 'point', 'lost', 'respect', 'movie', 'had', 'notified', 'police', 'then', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'final', 'confrontation', 'could', 'take', 'place', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Third', 'Sarah', 'diabetes', 'Come', 'only', 'reason', 'coincidence', 'so', 'Meg', 'leave', 'last', 'Meg', 'can', 'take', 'two', 'beefy', 'men', 'one', 'whom', 'sociopath', ""n't"", 'mind', 'killing', 'people', 'Give', 'break', 'can', 'understand', 'suspension', 'belief', 'movies', 'require', 'was', 'just', 'pushing', 'things', 'much', 'further', 'was', 'willing', 'go', 'reason', 'rated', 'movie', 'as', 'low', 'did.What', 'acting', 'Well', ""n't"", 'actually', 'too', 'bad', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'what', 'had', 'work', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'also', 'pretty', 'good', ""'m"", 'actually', 'quite', 'impressed', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'who', 'be', 'finding', 'niche', 'villain', 'Sling', 'Blade', 'only', 'person', 'really', 'had', 'problem', 'was', 'Junior', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'overly', 'stereotypical', 'rich', 'spoiled', 'kid', 'blah', 'blah', 'Otherwise', 'acting', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad.Overall', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'bring', 'give', 'movie', 'good', 'rating', 'kept', 'thinking', 'how', 'silly', 'plot', 'reversals', 'were', 'Anybody', 'brain', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'things', 'dramatically', 'different', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'coincidences', 'make', 'believable', 'film', 'should', 'also', 'note', 'trying', 'make', 'movie', 'tense', ""n't"", 'really', 'all', 'edge', 'seat', 'thrilling', 'Anyway', 'okay', 'film', 'can', 'give', 'characters', 'lot', 'leeway', 'really', 'stupid', 'decisions', 'make', 'number', 'coincidences', 'take', 'place', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'recommend', 'people', 'may', 'like']",N/A

701086,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B00006684S,A. Estes,"[6, 11]","There are three (3) things I have come to expect to see when viewing a David Fincher film:1. Rain. Lots and lots of rain2. The colors green and blue3. A completely left-of-center, sucks-to-be-you sort of endingAnd yes, in that sense, Panic Room delivers. But really, there's nothing else in this movie! For one thing, I personally didn't find it very suspenseful, I mean, two women (Well, Jodie Foster and a female Edward Furlong look-alike) being victimized by three men, you know that the women will win for the cause of being politically correct. Also, the villians (aside from ""Raoul"" played by Dwight Yoakam) weren't very threatening at all, just wanting to get into the room to get some money and scare the girls out. Jared Leto is almost unrecognizable in this movie. Half way through I thought to myself ""Hey, wasn't Jared Leto supposed to be in this movie?"" then finally I caught on that he is playing the corn-rowed leader, Junior. Forest Whitaker plays the least threatening one of them all, reminding me more of Carl Winslow from Family Matters than a criminal. The story is: Meg Altman, a divorced mom (played by Jodie Foster, who is always excellent) and her daughter (believe it or not, it is not little Eddie Furlong, but a newcomer by the name of Kristen Stewart) move into a giant house that was formerly inhabited by a paranoid shut-in. Within the house is a virtually unpenetratable safe-room with a phone line, known as the ""panic room"" where the home-owners can hide from invaders and call from help, unharmed. The room seems sort of pointless until the major plot-point comes into play: There are millions of dollars hidden under the floor of the panic room, and three intruders enter the house, not knowing that two people just moved in, with intents on grabbing the money. Of course, Meg notices the three men and her and Sarah quickly hide away into the Panic Room, causing one major problem for the intruders: They can't get the money. They try dilligently to get the girls to come out and resort to all sorts of weird tactics to try to drive the girls out. However, as things go wrong, tensions start rising, and well, I'll let you see the rest. The reason why I didn't like this movie is because of it's limited plot. This movie is what it looks like. There is nothing hidden under the surface and there is no underlying message. All this movies come across as, to me, is a 2 hour-long, spiffed up version of MTV's ""Jackass"" with the intruders trying odd stunts to draw the girls out of the room. Also, the ending, which I won't ruin for you, was extremely weak and anti-climactic. After viewing movies like Se7en and Fight Club, I expected another high-quality flick from Fincher. However, this movie is basically just recycling the odd camera techniques used in both of those films, and if you pay attention, you will notice that all of the ""impossible shots"" are computer generated. The DVD is also very weak, I had seen all these commercials for the DVD announcing this new ""Revolutionary Superbit Encoding Process"" feature, and now I realize, I have no idea what that is. Does anyone? This DVD doesn't look or sound any better than other DVDs. What makes this so special?Overall, I suggest you check out other David Fincher films. He is a man whose name is synonymous with quality. However, everyone has that one bad film, and this is his.",2,What a let-down!,1034553600,"10 14, 2002",2002,3373,"['are', 'three', '3', 'things', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'see', 'when', 'viewing', 'David', 'Fincher', 'film:1', 'Rain', 'Lots', 'lots', 'rain2', 'colors', 'green', 'blue3', 'completely', 'left-of-center', 'sucks-to-be-you', 'sort', 'endingAnd', 'yes', 'sense', 'Panic', 'Room', 'delivers', 'really', 'nothing', 'else', 'movie', 'one', 'thing', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'mean', 'two', 'women', 'Well', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'female', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'look-alike', 'being', 'victimized', 'three', 'men', 'know', 'women', 'will', 'win', 'cause', 'being', 'politically', 'correct', 'Also', 'villians', 'aside', 'Raoul', 'played', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'threatening', 'just', 'wanting', 'get', 'room', 'get', 'money', 'scare', 'girls', 'out', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'movie', 'way', 'thought', 'myself', 'Hey', 'was', ""n't"", 'Jared', 'Leto', 'supposed', 'be', 'movie', 'then', 'finally', 'caught', 'playing', 'corn-rowed', 'leader', 'Junior', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'least', 'threatening', 'one', 'reminding', 'more', 'Carl', 'Winslow', 'Family', 'Matters', 'criminal', 'story', 'Meg', 'Altman', 'divorced', 'mom', 'played', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'who', 'always', 'excellent', 'daughter', 'believe', 'not', 'not', 'little', 'Eddie', 'Furlong', 'newcomer', 'name', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'move', 'giant', 'house', 'was', 'formerly', 'inhabited', 'paranoid', 'shut-in', 'house', 'virtually', 'unpenetratable', 'safe-room', 'phone', 'line', 'known', 'panic', 'room', 'where', 'home-owners', 'can', 'hide', 'invaders', 'call', 'help', 'unharmed', 'room', 'sort', 'pointless', 'major', 'plot-point', 'play', 'are', 'millions', 'dollars', 'hidden', 'floor', 'panic', 'room', 'three', 'intruders', 'enter', 'house', 'not', 'knowing', 'two', 'people', 'just', 'moved', 'intents', 'grabbing', 'money', 'course', 'Meg', 'three', 'men', 'Sarah', 'quickly', 'hide', 'away', 'Panic', 'Room', 'causing', 'one', 'major', 'problem', 'intruders', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'money', 'try', 'dilligently', 'get', 'girls', 'come', 'out', 'resort', 'sorts', 'weird', 'tactics', 'try', 'drive', 'girls', 'out', 'However', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'tensions', 'start', 'rising', 'well', ""'ll"", 'let', 'see', 'rest', 'reason', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'limited', 'plot', 'movie', 'what', 'nothing', 'hidden', 'surface', 'underlying', 'message', 'movies', 'come', '2', 'hour-long', 'spiffed', 'up', 'version', 'MTV', 'Jackass', 'intruders', 'trying', 'odd', 'stunts', 'draw', 'girls', 'room', 'Also', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'was', 'extremely', 'weak', 'anti-climactic', 'viewing', 'movies', 'Se7en', 'Fight', 'Club', 'expected', 'high-quality', 'flick', 'Fincher', 'However', 'movie', 'basically', 'just', 'recycling', 'odd', 'camera', 'techniques', 'used', 'films', 'pay', 'attention', 'will', 'notice', 'impossible', 'shots', 'are', 'computer', 'generated', 'DVD', 'also', 'very', 'weak', 'had', 'seen', 'commercials', 'DVD', 'announcing', 'new', 'Revolutionary', 'Superbit', 'Encoding', 'Process', 'feature', 'now', 'realize', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'Does', 'anyone', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'look', 'sound', 'better', 'other', 'DVDs', 'What', 'so', 'special', 'Overall', 'suggest', 'check', 'out', 'other', 'David', 'Fincher', 'films', 'man', 'name', 'synonymous', 'quality', 'However', 'everyone', 'one', 'bad', 'film']",N/A

At one point one of the bad guys played by a greasy, corn rowed Jared Leto tells his gang of bumbling burglars that women - referring to a now firmly locked up Jodie Foster in her panic room - need safety and security. He wants to play on that to psych her out of the veritable vault that's preventing him from stealing his family's wealth. I think this sums up alot of why the movie works. There are lots of bad guys out there and at night when we shut the lights and go to sleep, they just might want to break in and prey on us. By having shelter within a shelter - a virtually impenetrable vault to hide - we feel safer, more secure and maybe we're even able to sleep better.Of course how many of us could afford a panic room? So with this film, we can live vicariously through Foster's character and her daughter as they make a stand against the intruders in their home. Fincher's direction is spot on terrific. He's a director who can evoke Hitchcock effortlessly, while never mimicking the master's style. The intricate camera work which pans over the elaborate and convincing sets may owe alot to digital magic, but it never looks synthetic.This is one you'll watch again and again.

701092,A1GOI8745FGIDN,B00006684S,"""an_avid_book_reviewer""","[1, 4]","The movie begins with a recently divorced wife and her child looking for home to buy.  They choose an expensive mansion/townhouse that has this ""panic room"" in case of emergency.  It has 3 foot thick steel walls, tv screens of all the surveilance cameras throughout the house, a separate phone line, and unknown to the new owners of the house, several million dollars worth of bonds in a hidden safe.  3 crooks did know about the bonds and all would have gone smoothly for them except for the fact that they moved into it a week early.Jodie Foster is pretty sexy in this one, acting most of the movie wearing a tight black spagetti top.  The girl who plays her daughter is ugly and I seriously thought she was a boy for about a half an hour into the movie until she was called by the name of Sarah.The plot is pretty engaging throughout the movie.  Three burglars break into their house, expecting it to be empty but they moved in a week early, so this creates problems.  The woman and her kid make it into the panic room just in time, in safety.  But the crooks won't leave so easily and they know more about the panic room than the new inhabitants do.  They know that the separate phone line for it isn't hooked up yet and they know there is a fortune in bonds in the safe, left behind by a deceased man that no one else knows about.  It is interesting seeing all the ways they try getting into the panic room and getting them to come out.  The unexpected pressure makes conflict break out among the three accomplices.  Two out three of them end up killed right in the house by each others hands.  I don't remember how or which crook knew of the bonds, but I was wondering why the woman or the crooks never thought of splitting it with her in exchange for her cooperation.  But that wouldn't have made much of a movie, now would it?  Like ""Ransom"", this movie shows how being rich can put one into danger by being a target.I found it ironic that the biggest crook of the three had been some type of security person working to keep guys like them out and now he's a crook because things didn't work out the way he wanted them to, he told the kid.  It was also ironic that the guy didn't want to hurt anyone in the burglary but he came back into the house to kill the burglar who was about to kill the woman.  Had it not been for that delay, he probably would have made it out of the place, and out of the country, with 22 million dollars.  But because he spared her life, the cops got him in time.  Telling him to hold his hands up, the bonds were in his fist.  They told him they wanted to see his palms, so he had to let go of the bonds and the wind of the storm that had been going on all night blew them away.  Then the scene moved ahead and her kid is older and they are looking at houses in the classifieds again.  I was wondering what would become of that man.  I mean, yes, he's guilty of breaking and entering and stealing the bonds, and killing his accomplice, but didn't he save the life of the woman and her kid?  If it wasn't for him, the other two would've just killed them, as they nearly did several times.",4,"No dull parts, continual suspense and plot twists.",1021939200,"05 21, 2002",2002,3123,"['movie', 'recently', 'divorced', 'wife', 'child', 'looking', 'home', 'buy', 'choose', 'expensive', 'mansion/townhouse', 'panic', 'room', 'case', 'emergency', '3', 'foot', 'thick', 'steel', 'walls', 'tv', 'screens', 'surveilance', 'cameras', 'house', 'separate', 'phone', 'line', 'unknown', 'new', 'owners', 'house', 'several', 'million', 'dollars', 'worth', 'bonds', 'hidden', 'safe', '3', 'crooks', 'did', 'know', 'bonds', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'smoothly', 'fact', 'moved', 'week', 'early.Jodie', 'Foster', 'pretty', 'sexy', 'one', 'acting', 'most', 'movie', 'wearing', 'tight', 'black', 'spagetti', 'top', 'girl', 'who', 'daughter', 'ugly', 'seriously', 'thought', 'was', 'boy', 'half', 'hour', 'movie', 'was', 'called', 'name', 'Sarah.The', 'plot', 'pretty', 'engaging', 'movie', 'Three', 'burglars', 'break', 'house', 'expecting', 'be', 'empty', 'moved', 'week', 'early', 'problems', 'woman', 'kid', 'make', 'panic', 'room', 'just', 'time', 'safety', 'crooks', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'so', 'easily', 'know', 'more', 'panic', 'room', 'new', 'inhabitants', 'do', 'know', 'separate', 'phone', 'line', ""n't"", 'hooked', 'up', 'yet', 'know', 'fortune', 'bonds', 'safe', 'left', 'behind', 'deceased', 'man', 'one', 'else', 'interesting', 'seeing', 'ways', 'try', 'getting', 'panic', 'room', 'getting', 'come', 'out', 'unexpected', 'pressure', 'conflict', 'break', 'out', 'three', 'accomplices', 'Two', 'three', 'end', 'up', 'killed', 'right', 'house', 'others', 'hands', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'how', 'crook', 'knew', 'bonds', 'was', 'wondering', 'why', 'woman', 'crooks', 'never', 'thought', 'splitting', 'exchange', 'cooperation', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'much', 'movie', 'now', 'would', 'Ransom', 'movie', 'how', 'being', 'rich', 'can', 'put', 'one', 'danger', 'being', 'target.I', 'found', 'biggest', 'crook', 'three', 'had', 'been', 'type', 'security', 'person', 'working', 'keep', 'guys', 'out', 'now', 'crook', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'way', 'wanted', 'told', 'kid', 'was', 'also', 'ironic', 'guy', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'hurt', 'anyone', 'burglary', 'came', 'back', 'house', 'kill', 'burglar', 'who', 'was', 'kill', 'woman', 'Had', 'not', 'been', 'delay', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'place', 'country', '22', 'million', 'dollars', 'spared', 'life', 'cops', 'got', 'time', 'Telling', 'hold', 'hands', 'up', 'bonds', 'were', 'fist', 'told', 'wanted', 'see', 'palms', 'had', 'let', 'go', 'bonds', 'wind', 'storm', 'had', 'been', 'going', 'night', 'blew', 'away', 'Then', 'scene', 'moved', 'ahead', 'kid', 'older', 'are', 'looking', 'houses', 'classifieds', 'again', 'was', 'wondering', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'man', 'mean', 'yes', 'guilty', 'breaking', 'entering', 'stealing', 'bonds', 'killing', 'accomplice', 'did', ""n't"", 'save', 'life', 'woman', 'kid', 'was', ""n't"", 'other', 'two', 'would', ""'ve"", 'just', 'killed', 'nearly', 'did', 'several', 'times']",N/A
701093,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00006684S,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 3]","I'm a rabid fan of David Fincher's work.  He has such a knack for creating sustained tension, so the grit and the aura of suspense permeate every frame of his films.  When he dwells within that niche, he rarely disappoints.`Panic Room' is a film about just that; a panic room.  A single mother still depressed over the failing of her marriage, moves into a beautiful new home with her young daughter.  One of the big pluses to the home is a panic room; a technically efficient room that will lock itself from outside interference and serve as a safe house in case of forced entry into the home.  Well, this depressed mother soon gets an unwanted housewarming present when three armed men break into her home.  Obviously, she and her daughter immediately race for the panic room, but the shocking reality that the strange men are desperate to get into that room begins to cause sheer panic.The film's script is a tad underwhelming in parts, but Fincher's direction is superb and the technical achievements here really elevate the film.  The tension is perfectly captured in the sound that inches into our eardrums, the way that the cinematography captures that element of fear and the way that each frame beautifully slides into the next to up the intensity.  The film can get a tad repetitive, and it certainly isn't as gritty as Fincher's previous work (`Se7en' and `Fight Club').  I had made mention to others that `Panic Room' felt like a melding of those two movies, but less successful as it intended to be.  The main issue is that the script doesn't allow us to really care about these people, and the acting comes off rather one-dimensional.  Forest Whitaker and Jodie Foster are serviceable, but they don't really emote anything but the expected.  Dwight Yoakam is kind of a clich&eacute;d disaster.  Jared Leto and Kristen Stewart (yeah, the one from `Twilight') are the film's two standouts.  Stewart doesn't have a lot to do, but she is rather effective in convincing us of her dwindling health, and Leto is crazed and desperate and chaotic to perfection, actually.Fincher knows how to push the right buttons, and so his skill certainly creates something memorable out of a skeletal script, but at the end of the day the film's major flaw remains that it is void of any real feeling.",3,Fincher injects much needed `panic' into this rather underwhelmed story...,1328832000,"02 10, 2012",2012,2294,"[""'m"", 'rabid', 'fan', 'David', 'Fincher', 'work', 'knack', 'creating', 'sustained', 'tension', 'grit', 'aura', 'suspense', 'permeate', 'frame', 'films', 'When', 'niche', 'rarely', 'disappoints.', 'Panic', 'Room', 'film', 'about', 'just', 'panic', 'room', 'single', 'mother', 'still', 'depressed', 'failing', 'marriage', 'beautiful', 'new', 'home', 'young', 'daughter', 'One', 'big', 'pluses', 'home', 'panic', 'room', 'technically', 'efficient', 'room', 'will', 'lock', 'outside', 'interference', 'serve', 'safe', 'house', 'case', 'forced', 'entry', 'home', 'Well', 'depressed', 'mother', 'soon', 'unwanted', 'housewarming', 'present', 'when', 'three', 'armed', 'men', 'break', 'home', 'Obviously', 'daughter', 'immediately', 'race', 'panic', 'room', 'shocking', 'reality', 'strange', 'men', 'are', 'desperate', 'get', 'room', 'cause', 'sheer', 'panic.The', 'film', 'script', 'tad', 'underwhelming', 'parts', 'Fincher', 'direction', 'superb', 'technical', 'achievements', 'here', 'really', 'elevate', 'film', 'tension', 'perfectly', 'captured', 'sound', 'eardrums', 'way', 'cinematography', 'element', 'fear', 'way', 'frame', 'beautifully', 'next', 'up', 'intensity', 'film', 'can', 'get', 'tad', 'repetitive', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'as', 'gritty', 'Fincher', 'previous', 'work', 'Se7en', 'Fight', 'Club', 'had', 'made', 'mention', 'others', 'Panic', 'Room', 'felt', 'melding', 'two', 'movies', 'less', 'successful', 'intended', 'be', 'main', 'issue', 'script', ""n't"", 'allow', 'really', 'care', 'people', 'acting', 'rather', 'one-dimensional', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'are', 'serviceable', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'emote', 'anything', 'expected', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'kind', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'disaster', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'yeah', 'one', 'Twilight', 'are', 'film', 'two', 'standouts', 'Stewart', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'do', 'rather', 'effective', 'convincing', 'dwindling', 'health', 'Leto', 'crazed', 'desperate', 'chaotic', 'perfection', 'actually.Fincher', 'how', 'push', 'right', 'buttons', 'so', 'skill', 'certainly', 'something', 'memorable', 'skeletal', 'script', 'end', 'day', 'film', 'major', 'flaw', 'void', 'real', 'feeling']",N/A

Before hearing who was in the Director's chair I immediately said 'There is no way I am going to see this', a kick in my ass came shortly after a friend of mine told that David Fincher was directing it. I dig David Fincher so much that if he decided to a movie about a monkey trapped in a mental asylum, I'd still see it. Hm.. now that actually sounds like a spiffy flick.. maybe I can write a script for it. So yes, it's David Fincher folks, he is good at whatever he does, thus this movie was good as well.This movie is quite simple, it also seems like it could be a 20 minute cartoon on the tube, but when you have David Fincher behind the camera you can't help but get plunged into it. Just the dark-gloomy visuals of this flick are absolutely breath taking. The eerie mood created by the enormous house, humorous crooks going after the panic room, it's all in here!So here go...Meg Altman played by Jodie Foster (Silence Of The Lambs, Contact) is a divorced mother who moves into this enormous palace with her daughter Kristen Stewart (Sarah Altman). Not even fully settled in, they are awaken by three burglars played by Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto and Dwight Yoakam whose plain is to go after what is in the 'panic room'.Not expecting anyone to be in the house, they soon find out that Meg & Sarah Altman actually moved in tad bit early. This of course gets into their way of robbing the house in peace and comfort and everything pretty much goes off the planned road.Seeing that this movie is a 'thriller', it does however resemble Fight Club for a tad bit. It is fraught with anecdotes just like Fight Club was. I found this unbelievably cool even though some people disagreed, some were saying that the movie could have gone without the humorous incidents. I don't see the big deal, I actually thought it was kind of cool.So what exactly is so good and so bad about this movie? The good is the way the movie was shot, the mood that was created from the story, the breath-taking visuals (blue flame explosion scene) & the opening credits (tell me that didn't look slick as all hell?) and of course the odd chemistry between the burglars. The bad is of course the plot turns, you could pretty much just sit there and call them one by one. Maybe some people will actually think that's cool, I don't know. I personally like being surprised more than  being able to tell what will happen next. The ending also left me kind of 'eh? what, no no no, ah come on' simply because I fell for one of the characters whose fate was kind of sad. The ending is not bat at all, this is purely my own opinion. Overall I was entertained by the movie and not once did I put my head down out of boredom.

701101,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00006684S,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[0, 0]","Claustrophobic. That's one way of describing this one set thriller. I wasn't a huge fan of director David Fincher at all when he first came out. Didn't like ""Alien 3"", ""Seven"", or ""Fight Club"". Things changed when I saw ""The Game"". And now, there is this. ""Panic Room"" is a fine, stylish, suspenseful thriller that is worthy of your night's entertainment. All future thrillers should take note of David Fincher's(and M. Night Shyamalan's)work. Jodie Foster stars as Meg Altman, a single mom with a young daughter named Sarah(Kristen Stewart,who I originally thought was a boy when I first saw the trailer for this. Woops.). She and her daughter move into a spacious new place in Manhattan. The place is gigantic. Through the tour, they learn of a secret room in the main bedroom called a 'panic room'. It's a safe place to go too when someone breaks into your house, or to keep things. The girls' first night in the new house is interrupted by the intrusion of three burglars. The three are expertly played by Forrest Whitaker, Jared Leto, and country superstar Dwight Yoakam. Meg discovers them and her and Sarah race to the panic room just in time. The two females are not out of harm's way because what the burglars want is in that very room. Meg and Sarah try to think of everything they can do to get help, and to keep the burglars from somehow getting into the room. The camera work is absolutely amazing. Right from the beginning of the film where you see the opening credits look as if they were part of the New York landscape, you know this movie is going to be interesting. Not to mention look interesting. The wonderful camera work continues through the rest of the film. It passes through walls, floors, keyholes, drain pipes, lightbulbs. It looks amazing. The screenplay by David Koepp is sharp and tight and never wanders. Keeps it real. The mood and setting is supposed to be dark, like most Fincher works, and this one is no different. The setting is part of the cast in a way and Fincher knows how to film it. The actors are all great. Jodie Foster proves once again why she is one of our best, most versatile actresses, and why we like and respect her so much. Plus, she looks amazing in this. Kristen Stewart, as Sarah, was pitch perfect casting. She looks like she could actually be Jodie's daughter. She is real. Very natural. Our three burglars are just as good. No one will look at Dwight Yoakam the same way ever again after this. He's mean, nasty, and creepy as hell. You won't be able to listen to ""Guitars And Cadillacs"" again without picturing him with a sledge hammer. Jared Leto sprouts corn rows here and it isn't pretty. He's the lesser of the two, but he still does an admirable job. Forrest Whitaker is his usual solid self. And, of course, there always seems to be a nicer one in a trio of bad guys. This is one of the better thrillers I've seen in a long time. It plays this drama out in front of you and feel like you are a part of it.

701102,A2YAABMT80RLYA,B00006684S,Ben Rowland,"[0, 0]","Like all of David Fincher's movies, ""Panic Room"" is more a study in cinematic style than it is cohesive storytelling. And while ""Panic Room"" lacks the surprising twists and turns of ""The Game"" and ""Fight Club"", it still succeeds as a standard suspense movie, with Jodie Foster carrying it further with her usual charm.The story is simple enough: Forster, a recently divorced mother, moves into a spacious Manhattan house with her teenage daughter (Kristen Stewart). The house is huge, with one unique feature, a ""panic room"", which is a self-contained safe room where people can retreat if something goes awry. Well, as luck would have it, something does go awry on their first night. A gang of burglars break in, assuming that no one's there. The gang is your typical stereotype: ""The Nice One"" (Forest Whitaker), the ""The irrational one"" (Jared Leto), and ""The Psychotic One"" (Dwight Yoakam). So Foster and her daughter retreat to the panic room and lock themselves in. Here's the twist: What the burglar's want is in the panic room.Nothing special, but for some reason, it works quite well. Many people have called ""Panic Room"" a violent, adult version of ""Home Alone"", but I think this movie deserves better. The writing is very well done, considering the mundane subject matter. The acting is first rate, with Foster doing her most believeable performance in years. Personally, I think she can make any movie good. David Fincher, ever the master of stlye, does some neat camera tricks, and the movie is kept interesting by the dark atmosphere. If you crave suspense, this movie will definitely please you. It has more than it's share of moments.The DVD hails from the ""Superbit collection"", which boasts impeccable picture quality, but it's relatively light on the extras. There are no featurettes, no documentaries, no commentary, and no deleted scenes. Fincher's movies are so interesting that you crave the extras after you see them. I have no idea why they consider scene selection, language selection, and interactive menus to be ""Special Features"", since they are the industry standard. My guess is that there will be a special edition of ""Panic Room"" coming out sometime in the near future.",4,A solid movie with great acting.

It was strange to get oout and search for an apartment at night.  With the scary movie, you have to use imagination to figure out what they are doing.  The owner specifically showed them the Panic Room and explained what its purpose was, to hide from things. The secret is that $30 million was hid in this hidey hole. The rooms were pretty large as Sarah rode around on her scooter; schoolhouse lights hung from the ceiling.  Meg, (Jodie Foster in glasses) appears to be a homely type.  The intruders knew that the house had a peep-hole.Perhaps all of the darkness makes for mystery. but it would have been more effective had the film been made in black and white.  Lighting has a lot to be desired.  Everything was dreary, no fun, no laughter.  It was most frustrating to not be able to see what is happening.  I've never liked movies filmed at night in big cities, or in the dark indoors.  We could see silhouettes of violence as the three outsiders tear the inside of the house apart with sledge hammers and noisy, loud chainsaw, looking for the stach of money.Camera work was erratic and the conversations confrontational with no love shown.  It was verbally abusive with lots of swearing and cussing.  This was like a late-night soap opera in drag.  The visitor did not take the spoils.  Instead...  Sarah was more adult than her mom at first.  Terror and abuse is something some kids learn in an unhappy marriage.  It is possible that Meg's husband, Steve, is involved with this intrusion.Before Sarah suffers a panic attack, after seeing her university prof father talking to the criminals, Meg becomes hysterical as her cell phone was not of much use in the Panic Room.  She had called her husband and said ""there are three...""The concierge, French for superintendent of supplies like Mona claimed to be in a Los Angeles hotel where Nat King Cole called her Mona Lisa, was avaukabke at a fancy apartment house near Central Park.  Some way, Meg had sent a subliminal message on the phone; the police arrive at the request of Steve.  At least, they know how to treat a woman out there, as opposed to K. P. who showed me no respect or integrity to a woman who was almost killed.  After the rescue, suddenly we see color as things appear normal for the first time.Meg and Sarah are out in the Park on a Fall day in glorious color.  How much better this movie would have been had we seen a bit of that color throughout and not relegated to the ending.  It was wasted by then.

701104,A82MLYSUUU3CF,B00006684S,"Bil Antoniou ""Movie madness!""","[3, 4]","Fans who were disappointed by the filmed adaptation of the novel Sliver will find much recompense in this taut Ira Levinesque thriller. Jodie Foster (at her most assured and compelling in years) plays a newly divorced mother (to Kristen Stewart) who buys a new Manhattan home based on its spacious rooms, many floors and a nifty bedroom feature: a completely secure, foolproof panic room, designed in case of emergencies like burglaries and the like. Foster dismisses the room as a useless novelty, the product of the corrupted mind of the paranoid millionaire who owned the home before she did. Unfortunately, her sentiments obviously fall on deaf karma, since on the very night of her moving in a trio of robbers (Jared Leto, Forest Whitaker, Dwight Yoakam) break in to her house, thinking the place still empty. Now, mother and daughter are trapped in a well-equipped but tiny little space with no way of escape, hoping that the gentlemen will just take what they want and leave. However, what they want turns out to be in that very room, and just because it's impossible to enter it doesn't mean the bad guys won't try. Tight as all hell, the film is about as scary as any film you'll ever see, directed with incredible precision by crafty David Fincher (The Game, Fight Club), who just seems to be getting better and better at this kind of film every time he tries it. Gorgeously shot by both Conrad L. Hall and Darius Khondji (who was fired during the shoot for having a level of perfectionism that made the film run way over schedule, which in turn was getting in the way of pregnant Foster's growing belly), the film was written by David Koepp (Jurassic Park, Death Becomes Her), and is safely acknowledgeable as his best script to date. The lead role was originally to be played by Nicole Kidman, who thanks to an injury she sustained while filming Moulin Rouge was unable to fulfill her commitment to this film, prompting Foster to drop out of her duties as president of the 2002 Cannes Film Festival Jury at last minute's notice and take over the role (Liv Ullmann later took Foster's position at Cannes and Foster made a small presentation during the Cannes Award ceremonies). Kidman's voice makes a tiny cameo as the voice of Foster's ex-husband's new wife.",4,Scary stuff!,1041984000,"01 8, 2003",2003,2270,"['Fans', 'who', 'were', 'disappointed', 'filmed', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'Sliver', 'will', 'find', 'much', 'recompense', 'taut', 'Ira', 'Levinesque', 'thriller', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'most', 'assured', 'compelling', 'years', 'newly', 'divorced', 'mother', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'who', 'new', 'Manhattan', 'home', 'based', 'spacious', 'rooms', 'many', 'floors', 'nifty', 'bedroom', 'feature', 'completely', 'secure', 'foolproof', 'panic', 'room', 'designed', 'case', 'emergencies', 'burglaries', 'like', 'Foster', 'room', 'useless', 'novelty', 'product', 'corrupted', 'mind', 'paranoid', 'millionaire', 'who', 'owned', 'home', 'did', 'Unfortunately', 'obviously', 'fall', 'deaf', 'karma', 'very', 'night', 'moving', 'trio', 'robbers', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'break', 'house', 'thinking', 'place', 'still', 'empty', 'Now', 'mother', 'daughter', 'are', 'trapped', 'well-equipped', 'tiny', 'little', 'space', 'way', 'escape', 'hoping', 'gentlemen', 'will', 'just', 'take', 'what', 'want', 'leave', 'However', 'what', 'want', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'room', 'just', 'impossible', 'enter', ""n't"", 'mean', 'bad', 'guys', 'wo', ""n't"", 'try', 'Tight', 'hell', 'film', 'as', 'scary', 'film', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'directed', 'incredible', 'precision', 'crafty', 'David', 'Fincher', 'Game', 'Fight', 'Club', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'getting', 'better', 'better', 'kind', 'film', 'time', 'Gorgeously', 'shot', 'Conrad', 'L.', 'Hall', 'Darius', 'Khondji', 'who', 'was', 'fired', 'shoot', 'having', 'level', 'perfectionism', 'made', 'film', 'run', 'way', 'schedule', 'turn', 'was', 'getting', 'way', 'pregnant', 'Foster', 'growing', 'belly', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'David', 'Koepp', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'Death', 'Becomes', 'Her', 'safely', 'acknowledgeable', 'best', 'script', 'date', 'lead', 'role', 'was', 'originally', 'be', 'played', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'who', 'injury', 'sustained', 'filming', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'was', 'unable', 'fulfill', 'commitment', 'film', 'prompting', 'Foster', 'drop', 'duties', 'president', '2002', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Jury', 'last', 'minute', 'notice', 'take', 'over', 'role', 'Liv', 'Ullmann', 'later', 'took', 'Foster', 'position', 'Cannes', 'Foster', 'made', 'small', 'presentation', 'Cannes', 'Award', 'ceremonies', 'Kidman', 'voice', 'tiny', 'cameo', 'voice', 'Foster', 'ex-husband', 'new', 'wife']",N/A

701113,A16EFRMJOKEI0B,B00006684S,Christopher Wyer,"[0, 0]","Panic Room is a new version of an old story but is much more than it appears.  The characters are trapped by the bad guys and for some reason, the cops aren't able to help.  It's been done before and will be done again.  This movie adds a new aspect to this simple story.  The addition of the panic room to the house, a room that nobody can get in or out of, that runs completely separate from the house.  Just watching the movie made me want one for myself.  The suspense of this movie is completely based on the room itself and the two sides of defending the room and attacking the room.  The movie was a lot more interesting than it sounds.The main character Meg Altman, played by Jodie Foster, and her daughter Sarah find themselves trapped in their new home when a group of burglars enter their home in the middle of the night.  The burglars aren't  just your run of the mill, smash and grab thieves.  One of them knows that the room exists and how the whole thing is put together.  The characters take turns having the upper hand that keeps the movie interesting throughout.  The atmosphere of the house itself also added to the suspense of the movie, taking on a creepy character all it's own.The casting in this movie is nothing short of spectacular.  Jared Leto, Forest Whitaker, and Dwight Yoakam all fit their respective roles to a tee.  Dwight Yoakam especially plays evil like it's second nature.  For another example check out ""Sling Blade.""  And Jodie Foster was excellent and in my mind the only move that proves that she ages at all is ""Taxi Driver.""  Kristen Stewart also did an admirable job playing Jodie Foster's daughter although I'll admit, I thought she was a boy for the first 15 minutes of the movie.The best part of the movie was the cinematography that director David Fincher used.  You can definitely tell that the same crew worked on Fight Club and Seven and I loved both of those movies.  The way the movie was shot added volumes to how creepy it was.  And the sets were so detailed that the fact that the movie was a single setting plot didn't bother me at all.  And the movie is worth seeing for just the opening credits alone.  I've never seen anything done quite like it.  All in all a good movie to see.The Breakdown:1.  Plot-8 (New version of an old story)2.  Characters-8 (Typical of these types of movies but nicely balanced)3.  Flow-8 (Slow start but nicely paced)4.  Atmosphere-10 (Highly detailed setting for a one set plot)5.

The bumbling ""bad guys"" are three stooger-like and show no signs of originality. The soundtrack is the main source of the thrills in an otherwise mediocre thriller. Throughout the film, there are obvious instances where the screenwriter ran out of ideas and just threw in ridiculous sequences to make the running time respectable.So if you're looking for a cheap, thoughtless thriller with no real creativity (except of course the unorthodox camera work of Fincher) this is the movie for you. But, if you're looking to see a film that keeps you interested with excellent all around acting, a realistic script, and effective suspense,(and you're a Jodie Foster fan) I recommend ""Silence of the Lambs.""

701116,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00006684S,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 3]","It's actually kind of remarkable that David Fincher has never made an outright terrible movie. Yeah he did do Alien 3 but in all fairness: with a nagging studio, production problems and an incomplete script, it's surprising there's something at least watchable with Alien 3, particularly its ""Assembly Cut"". But for every great film from Seven to Fight Club to Zodiac, we have the pretty good films such as the Game and this one. They're not as highly regarded but they're still fun entertainment and worth a watch, even if there's nothing to be gained from watching except for a good time.Meg and her daughter Sarah have just moved into a new house in New York. It's pretty big (maybe a bit TOO big) and it has a unique feature: a panic room, which has steel plating for walls, video surveillance system and a phone line not connected to the house's main line. It's the perfect place for a family to be safe when people try to break in. Of course that's what happens on the first night as 3 thieves: Junior, Raoul and Bernham show up and rather than wanting Meg's things, they want what's inside the panic room. The film then becomes a game of cat and mouse as Meg has to somehow outwit 3 robbers who want in.It's often been said that a script in the hands of a talented director can be a great film regardless of the thinner qualities of the script. No more is this evident in Panic Room which had anyone else directed (or at least, anyone who's a hack) it would've been awful. Sure there's not a lot to the script and you can tell screenwriter David Koepp threw as much as he could to give characters to do but damn if it doesn't work. To keep things interesting, Fincher uses a lot of computer assisted camera moves to keep things flowing with one of the best being a long take as the robbers initially start to inspect the house. Some work while others, such as going inside a lightbulb filament seem kind of unnecessary like it was a means to be playful.Acting-wise we have Jodie Foster who plays a great Meg; someone who's not an action superstar but is more than capable when she has to be. Kristin Stewart, who in my opinion, was the only thing that made the Messengers watchable plays the daughter Sarah and she's also quite good here. The 3 robbers played by Jared Leto, Forest Whitaker and Dwight Yoakam are quite a fun team to watch but have enough menace for Meg to fight with, particularly Yoakam who's quite the crazy bugger and probably also has one of the better entrances when you finally see his face since he had a ski mask a good chunk of the movie.One might find it odd that a film like Panic Room, which is essentially a superbly made B-movie, has tons of special features, even moreso than Seven or Panic Room's. We have director's commentary, star commentary with Foster, Yoakam and Whitaker who are also directors and a screenwriter's commentary. Then we get behind the scenes looks at the making of the film to featurettes on pre-visualization to the special effects shots one by one. Some discs are packed with stuff but seem kind of light and you could get through them in one afternoon; here it's kind of daunting.This isn't Seven or Panic Room but then again this ain't no Alien 3.

After the disappointment of 'The Game', we somehow knew that this interesting director would indeed attempt to out due himself, or at least show us that his casting director(s), after the dismal mistake with Michael Douglas, could redeem themselves. Let's face it, with a resume like Jodi Foster, its hard to go wrong, and this certainly was proved in ~Panic Room~. She puts in a grand performance that we've come to expect.This film grabs you from the start - the opening credits are original and quite impressive - so much so, they're worth the price of admission alone. In fact, call me strange, but I wanted to sneak back into the theatre during the second showing to see them again.The camera work is pure art. The planning for each shot shows an attention to detail and seamless quality that does not detract from the viewing. Confined to such a small space over months of shooting, every scene is painstakingly crafted; the editing is tight, which only adds to the suspense.The plot is almost laughably simple, but an excellent scenario in which to get actors and crew to surpass their limits as artists. Fencher surely achieved this end, because everything but the plot itself is superlative. During the first ten minutes of viewing, I kept thinking: in terms of style what does this film remind me of? Hitchcock came to mind. ~Panic Room~ has a 'Vertigo' and 'Rope' feel to it without question. For me, at any rate, this only added to the film's enjoyment.David Fencher set a new standard with his masterpiece, 'Seven' (another work of art in editing that won an Oscar nomination), which deserved all the acolades it received. But, unfortunately, ~Panic Room~ doesn't quite set a new standard, but more a thriller piece that should please moviegoers interested in this genre of film.A suggestion, do not wait for this film to come out on DVD or video, because it's made for the big screen.

No revelations are disclosed before the credits roll but every frame is strategically placed together in an effort to hold the viewer in constant peril until the final frame...and for the most part it works.The story revolves around a divorced mother (Foster) and her diabetic daughter (Stewart) who move into a new home just in time to have it broken into by three armed men (Jared Leto, Forest Whitaker & Dwight Yoakam) looking for a fortune left over by the previous owner.  These men are all different breeds and that's what adds to the layers of this film.  Leto, who to me is the star here, is the impatient flamboyant leader who knows where the money is and desires it the most.  Whitaker is trying to take care of his family and needs this money the most.  He's also the sensitive level headed one.  Yoakam is the calm and collected psychopath who might as well kill everyone to get what he wants.  When these men enter the house only to have Foster and Stewart lock themselves in 'The Panic Room', the only safe room in the house yet the only room the intruders desire to enter (that's where the money is) then the film gets extremely smart in showing how these men try and smoke them out sort-of-speak, and then turns to cat and mouse when things start to get out of hand.For the most part this is very effective, and I might even say it were effective 100% if it weren't for the fact that it really gave me no feeling.  I didn't really care about any of the characters...and to me Leto was the only real standout as far as acting.  Foster is a great actress but a little dry here (too bad Kidman was hurt...she would have been sensational!) while I will admitt Stewart is quite convincing.  The movie has a few jump scenes but nothing that will really evoke any fear and that's too bad because with a little tweaking this could have been brilliant...just add in a touch of the underlying fear of 'Se7en' and the mind-blowing truism of 'Fight Club' and 'Panic Room' would have been another Fincher classic.  Don't get me wrong...it's still a great film and a very smart one at that; it just falls a little short of brilliance!",4,Panic Worthy,1154304000,"07 31, 2006",2006,2545,"['remember', 'seeing', 'film', 'theater', 'being', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'differed', 'what', 'expected', 'yet', 'surpassed', 'expectations', 'expecting', 'scary', 'gritty', 'film', 'Fincher', 'previous', ""'Se7en"", 'even', 'something', 'more', 'lines', ""'Fight"", 'Club', 'gritty', 'smart', 'film', 'attention', 'mind', 'Instead', 'got', 'gritty', 'smart', 'film', 'period', 'Nothing', 'overly', 'fantastic', 'happens', 'revelations', 'are', 'disclosed', 'credits', 'roll', 'frame', 'strategically', 'placed', 'together', 'effort', 'hold', 'viewer', 'constant', 'peril', 'final', 'frame', 'most', 'part', 'story', 'revolves', 'divorced', 'mother', 'Foster', 'diabetic', 'daughter', 'Stewart', 'who', 'move', 'new', 'home', 'just', 'time', 'have', 'broken', 'three', 'armed', 'men', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'looking', 'fortune', 'left', 'over', 'previous', 'owner', 'men', 'are', 'different', 'breeds', 'what', 'layers', 'film', 'Leto', 'who', 'star', 'here', 'impatient', 'flamboyant', 'leader', 'who', 'where', 'money', 'most', 'Whitaker', 'trying', 'take', 'care', 'family', 'money', 'most', 'also', 'sensitive', 'level', 'headed', 'one', 'Yoakam', 'calm', 'collected', 'psychopath', 'who', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'kill', 'everyone', 'get', 'what', 'When', 'men', 'enter', 'house', 'only', 'have', 'Foster', 'Stewart', 'lock', ""'The"", 'Panic', 'Room', 'only', 'safe', 'room', 'house', 'yet', 'only', 'room', 'intruders', 'desire', 'enter', 'where', 'money', 'then', 'film', 'extremely', 'smart', 'showing', 'how', 'men', 'try', 'smoke', 'out', 'sort-of-speak', 'then', 'cat', 'mouse', 'when', 'things', 'start', 'get', 'hand.For', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'effective', 'might', 'even', 'say', 'were', 'effective', '100', '%', 'were', ""n't"", 'fact', 'really', 'gave', 'feeling', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'characters', 'Leto', 'was', 'only', 'real', 'standout', 'as', 'far', 'acting', 'Foster', 'great', 'actress', 'little', 'dry', 'here', 'too', 'bad', 'Kidman', 'was', 'hurt', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'sensational', 'will', 'admitt', 'Stewart', 'quite', 'convincing', 'movie', 'few', 'jump', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'will', 'really', 'evoke', 'fear', 'too', 'bad', 'little', 'tweaking', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'brilliant', 'just', 'add', 'touch', 'underlying', 'fear', ""'Se7en"", 'mind-blowing', 'truism', ""'Fight"", 'Club', ""'Panic"", 'Room', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Fincher', 'classic', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'still', 'great', 'film', 'very', 'smart', 'one', 'just', 'little', 'short', 'brilliance']",N/A

Waldman ""Film Guru""","[3, 5]","Thankfully in Panic Room David Fincher has abandoned doing a bad rip-off of Tarantino & instead does a decent take on Alfred Hitchcock.  Even the opening credits where the titles are superimposed on various New York City buildings bring to mind the credits sequence of North By Northwest. This is straight ahead storytelling, without any bad sermons and Fincher has made a better film for it.The plot follows a woman and her daughter as they move into an elaborate New York Townhouse/Brownstone combination (so the realtor tells us in the beginning) previously owned by a wealthy, paranoid recluse.  This old man was so fearful of burglars that he had built a small panic room into his bedroom for security.Three burglars break into the house and drive the mother and daughter into the panic room where they then engage in a battle of wits against each other.David Fincher has yet to make a movie which did not require a bit more of a suspension of disbelief than most other movies in a similar genre.  Panic Room is no exception.  I would immediately compare this film to Rear Window and Wait Until Dark, but inferior to those masterwaorks.  There are ways in which the villains torment the heroes which seemed a stretch, as well as the rather hokey inclusion of some disabilities for the heroes.  The mother, it is implied early on, is claustrophobic.  However this is only mentioned early on in the film and never brought up again.  A bit later it turns out that the daughter is diabetic.  A plot contrivance to make it necessary for the mother to try to sneak out and get the daughter's medicine.So try to push past that stuff, enjoy the elaborate camera angles, turn off your brain and be glad that this isn't a David Fincher movie where you also aren't getting a meandering sermon.",3,David Fincher's strongest film,1032393600,"09 19, 2002",2002,1787,"['Thankfully', 'Panic', 'Room', 'David', 'Fincher', 'abandoned', 'doing', 'bad', 'rip-off', 'Tarantino', 'instead', 'decent', 'take', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Even', 'opening', 'credits', 'where', 'titles', 'are', 'superimposed', 'various', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'buildings', 'bring', 'mind', 'credits', 'sequence', 'North', 'Northwest', 'straight', 'ahead', 'storytelling', 'bad', 'sermons', 'Fincher', 'made', 'better', 'film', 'it.The', 'plot', 'woman', 'daughter', 'move', 'elaborate', 'New', 'York', 'Townhouse/Brownstone', 'combination', 'realtor', 'beginning', 'previously', 'owned', 'wealthy', 'paranoid', 'recluse', 'old', 'man', 'was', 'so', 'fearful', 'burglars', 'had', 'built', 'small', 'panic', 'room', 'bedroom', 'security.Three', 'burglars', 'break', 'house', 'drive', 'mother', 'daughter', 'panic', 'room', 'where', 'then', 'engage', 'battle', 'wits', 'other.David', 'Fincher', 'yet', 'make', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'require', 'bit', 'more', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'most', 'other', 'movies', 'similar', 'genre', 'Panic', 'Room', 'exception', 'would', 'immediately', 'compare', 'film', 'Rear', 'Window', 'Wait', 'Dark', 'inferior', 'masterwaorks', 'are', 'ways', 'villains', 'torment', 'heroes', 'seemed', 'stretch', 'as', 'well', 'rather', 'hokey', 'inclusion', 'disabilities', 'heroes', 'mother', 'implied', 'early', 'claustrophobic', 'However', 'only', 'mentioned', 'early', 'film', 'never', 'brought', 'up', 'again', 'bit', 'later', 'out', 'daughter', 'diabetic', 'plot', 'contrivance', 'make', 'necessary', 'mother', 'try', 'sneak', 'out', 'get', 'daughter', 'medicine.So', 'try', 'push', 'past', 'stuff', 'enjoy', 'elaborate', 'camera', 'angles', 'turn', 'off', 'brain', 'be', 'glad', ""n't"", 'David', 'Fincher', 'movie', 'where', 'also', 'are', ""n't"", 'getting', 'meandering', 'sermon']",N/A
701123,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00006684S,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","The Egyptian pharaohs had it right all along; the only way to make your sanctuary, your abode of eternal rest, your panic room truly impregnable and safe is to kill the guys who build it as soon as the job is done.  Of course, you can't go around killing construction and security people willy-nilly, and that leads to the kind of situation we find in this movie.  When the newly-divorced and emotionally scarred Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) and her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart) manage to barricade themselves inside their new home's super-nifty panic room, they think they are safe from the three guys who have broken into the house.  They are wrong.  The paranoid, rich, recently deceased guy who owned the home before the Altmens had millions of dollars hidden inside a safe in that very panic room; these guys know it, and one of them helped build the darn panic room and safe himself.  So begins a standoff that never flags in intensity or leaves the viewer more than a few precious seconds in which to come up for air.Meg, despite her claustrophobic tendencies, proves herself to be quite the clever survivor, engaging the bad guys in a mental chess game of ingenuity, desperation, and the type of bravery that can only come from a parent's instinctual necessity to protect his/her child.  It's strange to think that Nicole Kidman was cast to play the role of Meg, bowing out a week or so into the project as a result of some type of injury.  As with any Jodie Foster role, I can't imagine anyone else playing this main character.  I love Nicole Kidman to death, but I think Jodie was much better suited for the part of Meg.  Of course, Jodie can't do everything herself; the movie's overall effectiveness also hinges on the performance of the three bad guys.  Jared Leto is quite good in a weasel sort of way, but Dwight Yoakam was quite unconvincing as the cold and hard ""Raoul.""  Luckily, Forest Whitaker more than takes up the slack to give a performance worthy of a Jodie Foster film.  He is the proverbial criminal with a conscience, and he plays the role extremely well, thereby churning up some additional emotions and feelings in the audience, creating more conflict in one's hopes of final resolution, and ensuring that the audience remains mesmerized in front of the screen until the credits roll.The DVD heralds itself as a Superbit DVD, which means it optimizes sound and video at a much more impressive level than normal DVDs.  I suppose this only adds to the effectiveness of the unusual camera angles and long camera pans moving from one story of the building to the others in long continuous shots.  I'm just a regular movie watcher, though, so I can't tell much difference in Superbit vs. regular DVDs.  I do know, albeit rather vaguely, that the Superbit technology works by using extra layers of the DVD to encode more technological whatsits and wossnames, extra layers that are often used for such things as extra features.  This helps explain why Panic Room comes with virtually no special features at all, only a trailer for the movie and short filmographies of a few of the actors and filmmakers.  Personally, I'd rather have a commentary and miscellaneous goodies.  Ultimately, though, this movie is so good that it's really all you need to make you happy.  Panic Room is a suspenseful thriller, but it really doesn't make any effort to scare the audience, making this a movie that all sorts of fans can marvel at and enjoy.",5,"An intense, suspensful thriller",1065744000,"10 10, 2003",2003,3456,"['Egyptian', 'pharaohs', 'had', 'right', 'all', 'along', 'only', 'way', 'make', 'sanctuary', 'abode', 'eternal', 'rest', 'panic', 'room', 'truly', 'impregnable', 'safe', 'kill', 'guys', 'who', 'build', 'as', 'soon', 'job', 'done', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'around', 'killing', 'construction', 'security', 'people', 'willy-nilly', 'kind', 'situation', 'find', 'movie', 'When', 'newly-divorced', 'emotionally', 'scarred', 'Meg', 'Altman', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'daughter', 'Sarah', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'manage', 'barricade', 'inside', 'new', 'home', 'super-nifty', 'panic', 'room', 'think', 'are', 'safe', 'three', 'guys', 'who', 'have', 'broken', 'house', 'are', 'wrong', 'paranoid', 'rich', 'recently', 'deceased', 'guy', 'who', 'owned', 'home', 'Altmens', 'had', 'millions', 'dollars', 'hidden', 'safe', 'very', 'panic', 'room', 'guys', 'know', 'one', 'helped', 'build', 'darn', 'panic', 'room', 'safe', 'So', 'standoff', 'never', 'flags', 'intensity', 'viewer', 'more', 'few', 'precious', 'seconds', 'come', 'up', 'air.Meg', 'claustrophobic', 'tendencies', 'be', 'quite', 'clever', 'survivor', 'engaging', 'bad', 'guys', 'mental', 'chess', 'game', 'ingenuity', 'desperation', 'type', 'bravery', 'can', 'only', 'come', 'parent', 'instinctual', 'necessity', 'protect', 'child', 'strange', 'think', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'was', 'cast', 'play', 'role', 'Meg', 'bowing', 'out', 'week', 'so', 'project', 'result', 'type', 'injury', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'role', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'playing', 'main', 'character', 'love', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'death', 'think', 'Jodie', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'suited', 'part', 'Meg', 'course', 'Jodie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'everything', 'movie', 'overall', 'effectiveness', 'also', 'performance', 'three', 'bad', 'guys', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'quite', 'good', 'weasel', 'sort', 'way', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'was', 'quite', 'unconvincing', 'cold', 'hard', 'Raoul', 'Luckily', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'more', 'up', 'slack', 'give', 'performance', 'worthy', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'film', 'proverbial', 'criminal', 'conscience', 'role', 'extremely', 'well', 'thereby', 'churning', 'up', 'additional', 'emotions', 'feelings', 'audience', 'creating', 'more', 'conflict', 'one', 'hopes', 'final', 'resolution', 'ensuring', 'audience', 'mesmerized', 'front', 'screen', 'credits', 'roll.The', 'DVD', 'heralds', 'Superbit', 'DVD', 'sound', 'video', 'much', 'more', 'impressive', 'level', 'normal', 'DVDs', 'suppose', 'only', 'effectiveness', 'unusual', 'camera', 'angles', 'long', 'camera', 'pans', 'moving', 'one', 'story', 'building', 'others', 'long', 'continuous', 'shots', ""'m"", 'just', 'regular', 'movie', 'watcher', 'though', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'much', 'difference', 'Superbit', 'vs.', 'regular', 'DVDs', 'do', 'know', 'rather', 'vaguely', 'Superbit', 'technology', 'works', 'using', 'extra', 'layers', 'DVD', 'encode', 'more', 'technological', 'whatsits', 'wossnames', 'extra', 'layers', 'are', 'often', 'used', 'such', 'things', 'extra', 'features', 'explain', 'why', 'Panic', 'Room', 'virtually', 'special', 'features', 'only', 'trailer', 'movie', 'short', 'filmographies', 'few', 'actors', 'filmmakers', 'Personally', ""'d"", 'rather', 'have', 'commentary', 'miscellaneous', 'goodies', 'Ultimately', 'though', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'really', 'need', 'make', 'happy', 'Panic', 'Room', 'suspenseful', 'thriller', 'really', ""n't"", 'make', 'effort', 'scare', 'audience', 'making', 'movie', 'sorts', 'fans', 'can', 'marvel', 'enjoy']",N/A

See? Just like carbon monoxide, the movie slaughters two of your finite hours on Planet Earth that you could have been using more enjoyably.Yes, this is a locked-room mystery, where the locked-room in question is a high-tech secret chamber located in an Upper Eastside Manhattan townhouse, and where the mystery is why a normally gifted, edgy director like David Fincher (Se7en, Fight Club) would direct a boring, colorless clunker like this.Jodie Foster plays Meg Altman, a divorcee who with her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart, who has three modes: sullen, smirking, and sick) moves into a multi-million dollar New York townhouse. Mother and daughter discuss their mutual disdain for the new digs, eat a pizza, and fall asleep.Now: it's fortunate Jodie toys with the high-tech Panic Room before turning in, because---wouldn't ya know it---along come three villains with the vilest of intentions. Talk about a bad first night in the new pad!It turns out the trio of thugs want the fortune stowed in the panic room by the townhouses's previous owner, and in their bumbling they manage to alert mom and daughter, who scuttle into the little fortress-within-a-fortress. So what you end up with is a 2 hour+ siege movie. Siege movies can be great, or they can be tedious; this movie takes the latter path and with, evidently, no regrets.It doesn't help that two of the three villains are pretty much out for the count when they realize they have to take on real live people holed up in the panic room. Dwight Yoakum plays Raoul, who is the real deal, a determined psycho if there ever was one, and he rallies his team's flagging spirits and the three determine to beg, borrow or steal their way into the high-tech little broom closet.And that's pretty much it. The much-touted CGI enhancement of camera movements in the townhouse is fine, and this is a technically competent movie. It's also a massively boring movie, and imminently forgettable; everything here has been done before, far more masterfully, in an underrated little gem called ""Wait Until Dark"". Everyone in ""Panic Room"" seems bored, and it's a contagious emotion, because by the conclusion you'll be bored too.Jodie Foster plays Jodie Foster, who toys with claustrophobia for about 5 minutes but tosses that potentially intereting plot device aside as soon as the going gets tough.

One assumes her ex will be responsible for the bills or she has been given a handsome settlement that enables her to continue with her life of trivial pursuits.Enter the men. Three thieves. All, naturally of course, lacking enough collective cerebral power to exit the house on finding it is occupied and coming back at another time.

So why not stay and see how it goes? Duh?Well predictably it doesn't go well. Motivated by the impoverishing divorce where she can now only access millions of dollars instead of tens or hundreds of millions and protecting her chronically wounded daughter, the mother puts up a mythic defense against the sullying patrimony of society.

When three men break into the house, Meg and Sarah take refuge in the house's unusual ""panic room"", an indoor fortress meant to serve as a hidden and impenetrable haven for its residents.  The problem is, the burglars not only know about the panic room, but they will do anything to get what is hidden inside it.  Closed off from help, the women must rely on their resourcefulness to repel the equally determined intruders. Just when you think things can't get any worse, they do.  This is ""Home Alone"" with a deadly seriousness.  (The screenplay acknowledges this when one of the burglars calls another ""Joe Pesce."")The trailers for this highly suspenseful film made it seem more terrifying than it actually is.  ""Panic Room"" relies more on tension and desperation than it does on sheer fear - and it is a much better film for it.  Jodie Foster turns in a skilled, believable performance, as does Kristen Stewart, who not only looks like she could be Foster's biological child but acts that way, too.  Forest Whitaker, as the brains of the burglary, provides complexity to a character that might otherwise have been a type; you can't help wishing that he was not a part of the operation.  The camera work (not dissimilar to that of television's ""CSI"") works to increase the tension, although often it comes across as an effect for effect's sake.""Panic Room"" held my attention from beginning to end.

It's shorter than Is...","[27, 30]","I had to wonder, coming out of the theater, if PANIC ROOM wasn't David Fincher's attempt to Keep Hollywood Happy. After his brilliant FIGHT CLUB suffered mixed reviews and box office failure, he must have been aware that he needed a Big Hit if he wanted to keep making movies.Enter PANIC ROOM, a dark, sharp thriller which showcases the talents of Jodie Foster and Forest Whitaker in a cat-and-mouse game between the new owner of a house and the builder of its security systems who is hoping to steal something the previous owner left behind: Whitaker and his crew break in, thinking the new occupants haven't yet moved in, and Foster has time to rush herself and her daughter into the house's Panic Room, an extremely secure high-tech saferoom: the room keeps the intruders out, but it also keeps their intended victims in.Foster is brilliant as the claustrophobic mom who will do anything to keep her daughter safe, but the film comes up short when she makes choices that most of the audience will perceive as short-sighted at best and stupid at worst. Foster overcomes this script shortcoming by playing the choices convincingly--you can read the conundrum in her face and believe in her reasoning when she makes the poor choice.It's a credit to Whitaker that his ""villain"" character remains sympathetic throughout--he's not the sort of terrorist-cum-robber that made Alan Rickman famous in DIE HARD. You find yourself hoping that some accord can be reached--that he can just get what he wants and get out safely. Unfortunately, his psychotic partners-in-crime make that an impossibility.Fincher has always done an excellent job of taking us to the dark side of things, leading the camera into places that the human eye could never see. I'm not sure PANIC ROOM will have the staying power and rewatchability of FIGHT CLUB or SE7EN, but it's definitely the sort of taut thriller that's been missing from the A-movie circuit for years.

The ""Panic Room"" as it is called contains unknowingly treasure bonds which the robbers have set their sights on. The criminals are played by a solemn Whitaker, a cocky Jared Leto and the psychopath-in-a-mask Yoakham. Their conflicts act on to the palpable tension.No doubt the story is a conventional damsel-in-distress; but Fincher having helmed Seven, Fight Club and The Game stylishly creates a five-storey house on the Upper West side. He manipulates the space through fluid camera takes and swoops down with spectral camera through airducts and walls to intensify the narration. The house is immediately cavernous and sepulchural.

This will almost certainly give Fincher his greatest box office takings, but he can be equally proud of his latest work which will be appreciated by the masses and not only the cult followers his other works have attracted. Jodie Foster carries the film with a performance that equals her Oscar winning performance of her best work, Silence Of The Lambs. She is entirely convincing in her role of a recently divorced mother who moves into a large (too large) new house with her 12 year old daughter, only to become a target of three burglars during her first night in her new home. Country singer Dwight Yoakam is outstanding in his supporting role of burglar Raoul, and his performance is complemented by fellow criminals Forest Whittaker (this actor gains the audiences sympathy in almost every role he takes), and comic relief Jared Leto. My attention didn't waver for the entire duration of the film and both the gasping and prolonged silences of the audience in the theatre seemed to indicate that they too were both surprised and enthralled by the film's twists and turns.

701138,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00006684S,D. Litton,"[6, 18]","What exactly is a panic room? According to David Fincher's new film, appropriately titled ""Panic Room,"" these small, virtually impregnable rooms come equipped with everything from surveillance cameras to a separate, hidden phone line... everything one should need in the event of a burglary or a forced entry. And now, this latest rage in home security finds itself at the center of a thriller that delivers suspense and implausibility in equal measure.Jodie Foster plays Meg Altman, a recently divorced mother in the market for a new home. She shares a slightly distanced relationship with her daughter, Sarah (Kristen Stewart); from a conversation between the two early in the film, we gather that all Meg wants is to move on with her life. Her search ends with the purchase of spacious Manhattan home complete with four floors, four fireplaces, an elevator, and (surprise!) a hidden room found behind a mirrored panel in the master bedroom.The movie does have the good sense to provide an explanation for the inclusion of a panic room in this otherwise normal abode. We are told that the previous owner of the house, a wealthy tycoon fearful of being robbed, had the room built in case of emergences. Coincidentally, this piece of information is followed by the revelation that a comely portion of the deceased's fortune has since been missing (three guesses as to where it's hidden).To keep things succinct, Meg and Sarah's first night in their new house becomes quite the nightmare when three burglars (played by Jared Leto, Forest Whitaker, and Dwight Yoakam) force their way in, unaware that the house is now occupied until it is too late. Before they have a chance to collect their reward, Meg and Sarah find refuge in the panic room, where a battle of wits, wills and intelligence ensues as they attempt the thwart the thieves' tactics to penetrate the room.For all the positive buzz the stronghold attains, there are flaws. For instance, why is it customary that the new owner should have the emergency phone line connected upon arrival? Should it not be a permanently connected line directly to the police? And what about the room's ventilation system, that which enables Meg's aggressors to fill the room with gaseous fumes in one of the film's reality-stretching scenes? Would not such a structure be embedded within the concrete and steel walls of the room? As the attempts to enter the room become more frantic, such questions become increasingly bothersome.The thieves themselves aren't all too challenging, either. Leto, Whitkaker, and Yoakam do fine jobs in handling the moments of humorous intervention, but this comic relief serves to lessen the suspense that surrounds it. Whitaker's character plays the token softy, while Yoakam's character is increasingly agitated, and furthermore, dimwitted. At one point, observing Meg disabling the surveillance cameras, he makes the remark, ""Why didn't we think of that?""Director David Fincher (""Seven"") does give the film more redeeming qualities than one would think. He wears his Hitchcock pedigree proudly on his sleeve, filling the movie with an arsenal of foreboding shots that begin on one floor and end on another, sweeping through banisters and revolving throughout hallways and rooms. Underneath the film's predictability lies an undercurrent of effective suspense that holds up surprisingly well, due in part to the claustrophobic setting, and Foster, whose performance is marked by fear and determination.In the end, a film like ""Panic Room"" is best enjoyed with a continuous suspension of disbelief. The setting is quite striking, not to mention original, but much that revolves around the implausible plot becomes increasingly conventional. For the measurable amount of shocks and energy it manages to generate, the movie qualifies as a by-the-numbers crowd pleaser, but it's by no means nothing to panic over.",3,Delivers suspense and implausibility in equal measure.,1017705600,"04 2, 2002",2002,3885,"['What', 'exactly', 'panic', 'room', 'According', 'David', 'Fincher', 'new', 'film', 'appropriately', 'titled', 'Panic', 'Room', 'small', 'virtually', 'impregnable', 'rooms', 'come', 'equipped', 'everything', 'surveillance', 'cameras', 'separate', 'hidden', 'phone', 'line', 'everything', 'one', 'should', 'need', 'event', 'burglary', 'forced', 'entry', 'now', 'latest', 'rage', 'home', 'security', 'center', 'thriller', 'delivers', 'suspense', 'implausibility', 'equal', 'measure.Jodie', 'Foster', 'Meg', 'Altman', 'recently', 'divorced', 'mother', 'market', 'new', 'home', 'shares', 'slightly', 'distanced', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'Sarah', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'conversation', 'two', 'early', 'film', 'gather', 'Meg', 'move', 'life', 'search', 'purchase', 'spacious', 'Manhattan', 'home', 'complete', 'four', 'floors', 'four', 'fireplaces', 'elevator', 'surprise', 'hidden', 'room', 'found', 'mirrored', 'panel', 'master', 'bedroom.The', 'movie', 'have', 'good', 'sense', 'provide', 'explanation', 'inclusion', 'panic', 'room', 'otherwise', 'normal', 'abode', 'are', 'told', 'previous', 'owner', 'house', 'wealthy', 'tycoon', 'fearful', 'being', 'robbed', 'had', 'room', 'built', 'case', 'emergences', 'Coincidentally', 'piece', 'information', 'followed', 'revelation', 'comely', 'portion', 'deceased', 'fortune', 'been', 'missing', 'three', 'guesses', 'where', 'hidden', '.To', 'keep', 'things', 'succinct', 'Meg', 'Sarah', 'first', 'night', 'new', 'house', 'quite', 'nightmare', 'when', 'three', 'burglars', 'played', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'force', 'way', 'unaware', 'house', 'now', 'occupied', 'too', 'late', 'have', 'chance', 'collect', 'reward', 'Meg', 'Sarah', 'find', 'refuge', 'panic', 'room', 'where', 'battle', 'wits', 'wills', 'intelligence', 'ensues', 'attempt', 'thwart', 'thieves', 'tactics', 'penetrate', 'room.For', 'positive', 'buzz', 'stronghold', 'are', 'flaws', 'instance', 'why', 'customary', 'new', 'owner', 'should', 'have', 'emergency', 'phone', 'line', 'connected', 'arrival', 'Should', 'not', 'be', 'permanently', 'connected', 'line', 'directly', 'police', 'what', 'room', 'ventilation', 'system', 'Meg', 'aggressors', 'fill', 'room', 'gaseous', 'fumes', 'one', 'film', 'reality-stretching', 'scenes', 'Would', 'not', 'such', 'structure', 'be', 'embedded', 'concrete', 'steel', 'walls', 'room', 'attempts', 'enter', 'room', 'become', 'more', 'frantic', 'such', 'questions', 'become', 'increasingly', 'bothersome.The', 'thieves', 'are', ""n't"", 'all', 'too', 'challenging', 'either', 'Leto', 'Whitkaker', 'Yoakam', 'do', 'fine', 'jobs', 'handling', 'moments', 'humorous', 'intervention', 'comic', 'relief', 'serves', 'lessen', 'suspense', 'Whitaker', 'character', 'token', 'softy', 'Yoakam', 'character', 'increasingly', 'agitated', 'furthermore', 'dimwitted', 'one', 'point', 'observing', 'Meg', 'disabling', 'surveillance', 'cameras', 'remark', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'Director', 'David', 'Fincher', 'Seven', 'give', 'film', 'more', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'Hitchcock', 'pedigree', 'proudly', 'sleeve', 'filling', 'movie', 'arsenal', 'foreboding', 'shots', 'begin', 'one', 'floor', 'end', 'sweeping', 'banisters', 'revolving', 'hallways', 'rooms', 'film', 'predictability', 'undercurrent', 'effective', 'suspense', 'up', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'due', 'part', 'claustrophobic', 'setting', 'Foster', 'performance', 'marked', 'fear', 'determination.In', 'end', 'film', 'Panic', 'Room', 'best', 'enjoyed', 'continuous', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'setting', 'quite', 'striking', 'not', 'mention', 'original', 'much', 'implausible', 'plot', 'increasingly', 'conventional', 'measurable', 'amount', 'shocks', 'energy', 'generate', 'movie', 'by-the-numbers', 'crowd', 'pleaser', 'means', 'nothing', 'panic']",N/A

The problem, however, is that what the burglars want is inside that panic room and they won't leave until they get what they came for.  So what should make the victims feel safe now compromises their safety.It was suspenseful watching the burglars think up new tricks to break inside the panic room and wondering how the mother (played by Jodie Foster) would be able to block their entry.  However, the suspense was dragged out too long in some places.  There were times where I felt like screaming at the mother to get moving already.I also wasn't sure if I'm supposed to like Whitaker's character or dislike him.

A major star, some recognizable minor stars, a good director, a good premise.  This is the story of a recently separated mother and teenage daughter who buy what has to be a multi-million dollar residence in Manhattan.  It is equipped with something called a &quot;Panic Room&quot;, which is a fortified room in the middle of the house to protect the inhabitants from home invaders.  The fact that the Panic Room gets a workout right away is the plot of the film.This film has a lot of things going for it, but doesn't offer us anything that special.  On the good side, we get a trio of believable bad guys of varying degrees of badness.  We get to see Jodie Foster thinking of how to get out of a nasty situation, which reminds us a bit of dueling Buffalo Bob in a dark house in that &quot;Lamb&quot; movie.  And we get some plot twists that force here to actually make a truce with the bad guys at a crucial moment.It's just that there's nothing that is that special.  I suppose if you have a movie called &quot;Panic Room&quot;, which has a Panic Room, you should use the Panic Room.  Coincidently, they need it on their very first night, which is necessary to the plot, as the fact that it isn't all hooked up properly makes in only a marginally effective device.  And there is a problem with one of the bad guys not being as bad as the other bad guys.  You just know this will be the one that will be turned to for help, and it's so obvious I'm not really revealing anything here.

I did admire the camera work, and the angles that were used on some of the shots.  But, at the same time I found that I was more interested in the camera work than the actually story, which is pretty much none existant.Set up, mother and daughter move into huge apartment with 50 rooms and 12 stories, and hundreds of video cameras.  Of course, the first night robbers try to break in.  Couldn't it have been a week later at least?  The rest of the movie is pretty unbelievable.  The robbers break in, three of them.  Larry, Moe and Curly.  One is an idiot, one is psycho and the other is a professor of everything.  Long story short, the mother and daughter go into the panic room only to find that that is where the robbers want to go too.  Sadly, the mother forgot her daughter's diabetes meds.  So, while they are stuck on the 12th floor, the meds are on the 2nd floor.  Of course her daughter starts to get low blood sugar.  So, instead of getting out of the room and getting out the window while the robbers are on the first floor, they stay there.  When I asked my friend, why don't they just get out while the robbers are downstairs she said, ""because the door would make a lot of noise and the robbers would know that they are opening the door.""  Wrong, they opened the door and there wasn't a sound at all.  Totally illogical when you know they want to get into the room that your hiding in.  The ending, well it was like the rest of the movie, dumb.  Panic Room is a good rental when you've seen every other movie in the store.

Its almost set in stone already. What many people don't think of, though, are the high-quality Home Video Releases of his films, particularly on DVD. Whereas 'Panic Room' may be his least-engaging film (outside of 'Alien 3', of course, but to anybody who knows anything about that film's Production, it almost shouldn't count), this 3-Disc DVD release for it contains some of the most instructive and detailed Special Features for any Movie I've yet come across. This puts a number of Criterion Releases to shame. YOU LEARN HOW THEY MADE THIS MOVIE.Love the movie or hate it, if you're a filmmaker, or a person interested in Filmmaking, this is one of the Must-Buy DVD/Blu Ray sets to have in your collection. So much about this film's creation, from David Koepp's inception of his idea to the film's Theatrical Release, is covered here in remarkable detail. Outside of the FOUR Info-loaded commentaries on the 1st disc, the 2nd two discs contain so much that if I listed exactly what here, your mouth may drop. Let's put it this way: the Special Features are so insightful and so instructional, that they themselves have commentaries loaded with even more information. Like I said: you learn how they made this movie.What's better? If you are a person who can catch a hint, like if you hear someone mention the phrase 'Negative Pulldown' or 'Digital Intermediate' or 'Image Latitude', and can recognize that somebody is pointing you in the direction of EVEN MORE information, this set is  even more than a must-buy: A 'BUY-THIS-NOW!' DVD set. What more can I say about the Special Features outside of the fact that it isn't one of those boring, half-assed ones that merely feature everyone who worked on the film patting each other on the back the entire time?Regarding the movie itself, this is the best Home video release of Panic Room available right now. Mastered in HD, the movie looks and sounds great on DVD. Not a half-assed release like that Superbit release of the film. Although not Fincher's best, it isn't bad.

701156,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B00006684S,General Zombie,"[1, 2]","I think I'll keep this one short.  'Panic Room' is a sharp, well-executed thriller.  In terms of plot and ideas it's definitely a cut below earlier Fincher films like 'Fight Club' and 'Seven'.  (You spell it 'Se7en' and I cut you! I cut you bad!!!)  Still, Fincher's technical ability shines thru along with a reasonably plausible and intelligent script to allow this to be a very worthwhile film, even if it doesn't really have a terribly strong impact once it's all over.You gotta already know the setup, but here it is: Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) and her creepy hermaphrodite child move into an absurdly massive and fancy house in New York (?), one which was inhabited by a rather eccentric old man who was particularly concerned with security.  Thus the house contains a panic room, which contains an additional phone line and various video screens and is just virtually impenetrable.  On their first night in the house a trio of burglars break into their home, and Meg and her daughter flee into the panic room.  Trouble is, they've got no way to contact the outside world, and the items the thieves are after are located in the panic room itself.  And that's about it.  As is true of most well-done thrillers, a lot more happens within this scenario than you likely would've thought possible, all with out becoming to terribly contrived.Fincher has always been a great visual stylist, and that ability is nicely displayed here, with smooth, gliding camera movements combined with CGI for clean movement all about the house.  The whole thing is just very dark and ominous, as per usual, but in sleek, modern way rather than the clattering industrial mess you'd find in 'Seven'.  Performances are first-rate, though there is occasionally a disturbing lack of characterization.  This is particularly a concern for Foster's character, as she is, theoretically, the protagonist, but proves to be pretty flat, and didn't really draw any particular sympathy from me.  And the kid, ooh the kid is just as annoying as hell.  By the end of the film Forest Whitaker's Burnham, one of the robbers, proves to be by far the most interesting and sympathetic character of the bunch.  This allows us to sympathize with someone, I suppose, which is nice, but for much of the film I was interested in what was going to happen, but I didn't especially *care*.  A wide variety of results would've been acceptable.  The film does do a nice job of slowly revealing the true nature of the characters as we move along, but this does mean that they start out pretty faceless.Thinking back I have a hard time remembering the particular flow of events in the film.  It is, again, a bit more plausible than your average thriller, and most of the events flow into one another smoothly enough that it seems like a fairly continuous whole.  It's harder to dissect and pick apart in my mind, which might make it hold up better on repeated viewings.That's about it, I guess.  The DVD looks very nice, as you'd expect for a Superbit one.  Again, I dunno if this is the sorta movie that's gonna impact anyone terribly, but it's done with enough panache and professionalism that it proves very watchable, and I'll no doubt pull it out for another viewing every once in a while.Grade: B+",4,Entertaining,1141516800,"03 5, 2006",2006,3254,"['think', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'one', 'short', ""'Panic"", 'Room', 'sharp', 'well-executed', 'thriller', 'terms', 'plot', 'ideas', 'definitely', 'cut', 'earlier', 'Fincher', 'films', ""'Fight"", 'Club', 'spell', ""'Se7en"", 'cut', 'cut', 'bad', 'Still', 'Fincher', 'technical', 'ability', 'shines', 'thru', 'reasonably', 'plausible', 'intelligent', 'script', 'allow', 'be', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'even', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'terribly', 'strong', 'impact', 'over.You', 'got', 'ta', 'already', 'know', 'setup', 'here', 'Meg', 'Altman', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'creepy', 'hermaphrodite', 'child', 'move', 'absurdly', 'massive', 'fancy', 'house', 'New', 'York', 'one', 'was', 'inhabited', 'rather', 'eccentric', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'particularly', 'concerned', 'security', 'Thus', 'house', 'panic', 'room', 'additional', 'phone', 'line', 'various', 'video', 'screens', 'just', 'virtually', 'impenetrable', 'first', 'night', 'house', 'trio', 'burglars', 'break', 'home', 'Meg', 'daughter', 'flee', 'panic', 'room', 'Trouble', ""'ve"", 'got', 'way', 'contact', 'outside', 'world', 'items', 'thieves', 'are', 'are', 'located', 'panic', 'room', 'true', 'most', 'well-done', 'thrillers', 'lot', 'more', 'happens', 'scenario', 'likely', 'would', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'possible', 'out', 'becoming', 'terribly', 'contrived.Fincher', 'always', 'been', 'great', 'visual', 'stylist', 'ability', 'nicely', 'displayed', 'here', 'smooth', 'gliding', 'camera', 'movements', 'combined', 'CGI', 'clean', 'movement', 'house', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'very', 'dark', 'ominous', 'usual', 'sleek', 'modern', 'way', 'rather', 'clattering', 'industrial', 'mess', ""'d"", 'find', ""'Seven"", 'Performances', 'are', 'first-rate', 'occasionally', 'disturbing', 'lack', 'characterization', 'particularly', 'concern', 'Foster', 'character', 'theoretically', 'protagonist', 'be', 'pretty', 'flat', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'draw', 'particular', 'sympathy', 'kid', 'kid', 'just', 'as', 'annoying', 'hell', 'end', 'film', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Burnham', 'one', 'robbers', 'be', 'far', 'most', 'interesting', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'bunch', 'sympathize', 'someone', 'suppose', 'nice', 'much', 'film', 'was', 'interested', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'did', ""n't"", 'especially', '*care*', 'wide', 'variety', 'results', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'acceptable', 'film', 'do', 'nice', 'job', 'slowly', 'revealing', 'true', 'nature', 'characters', 'move', 'along', 'mean', 'start', 'out', 'pretty', 'faceless.Thinking', 'back', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'remembering', 'particular', 'flow', 'events', 'film', 'again', 'bit', 'more', 'plausible', 'average', 'thriller', 'most', 'events', 'flow', 'one', 'smoothly', 'enough', 'fairly', 'continuous', 'whole', 'harder', 'dissect', 'pick', 'apart', 'mind', 'might', 'make', 'hold', 'up', 'better', 'repeated', 'viewings.That', 'guess', 'DVD', 'very', 'nice', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Superbit', 'one', 'Again', 'dunno', 'sorta', 'movie', 'gon', 'na', 'impact', 'anyone', 'terribly', 'done', 'enough', 'panache', 'professionalism', 'very', 'watchable', ""'ll"", 'doubt', 'pull', 'out', 'viewing', 'once', 'while.Grade', 'B+']",N/A

There isn't a huge amount to go into beyond that concept because the movie is fairly basic in concept.  Though, I have to admit that the way they generated the drama with the location was quite impressive.This is a movie based around the story of a robbery gone wrong.  The robbers didn't expect anyone to be in the house, but Jodi Foster's character and her daughter had already moved in early.  The house has some unusual features, such as an elevator and a panic room.  The panic room, which the movie is named after, is a small room that people can hide in and survive if attacked.  It's behind very thick steel, so it's nigh impossible to get through and it comes complete with a camera surveillance system.  Naturally the robbers were expecting the room to be empty, but Foster really throws that wrench in their plans.  What they're after is in that room, it just so happens that one of the robbers installs those kinds of rooms, thus enter Forest Whittaker.  As you can see the stage is set for a very suspenseful ride.  The whole movie takes place in this house and really doesn't go anywhere else.  That alone is fairly impressive.  Seriously, to stay on screen for two hours and not leave the same location, that takes pretty good writing and they do manage to pull it off.  Not to mention this is all done with like five actors and a sixth enters later with almost no lines.Despite the very competent acting, the film still felt a tad drawn out.  This is a shock to hear me say because I'm usually the guy wanting more out of the movie!  The suspense was certainly great and the acting was very well done.  However, I can't see myself watching this numerous times in the future and that's what really separates a great movie from an okay movie for me.  I did like the interaction with the robbers the most once they realized their carefully laid plans weren't going very smooth.  The audience is meant to eventually sympathize with Whittaker's character, which I thought was a bit of an interesting twist, though I really don't think Whittaker would make a really good down and dirty robber with loads of violent experience.  Seriously, it's just not him, so he was perfect for this role of a man who was in over his head, so to speak.I think this is definitely a movie worth seeing once, at the very least.  If you're a fan of Jodi Foster films I don't see how this could possibly disappoint you.  I'm not a huge fan of hers, but I typically enjoy the films she puts out.  That's about all I can think to say on this, just a good thrilling and suspenseful movie if you ask me.",3,A thrilling and dramatic experience,1214438400,"06 26, 2008",2008,2662,"['can', 'see', 'rating', 'really', 'just', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'okay', ""n't"", 'huge', 'amount', 'go', 'concept', 'movie', 'fairly', 'basic', 'concept', 'have', 'admit', 'way', 'generated', 'drama', 'location', 'was', 'quite', 'impressive.This', 'movie', 'based', 'story', 'robbery', 'gone', 'wrong', 'robbers', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anyone', 'be', 'house', 'Jodi', 'Foster', 'character', 'daughter', 'had', 'already', 'moved', 'early', 'house', 'unusual', 'features', 'such', 'elevator', 'panic', 'room', 'panic', 'room', 'movie', 'named', 'small', 'room', 'people', 'can', 'hide', 'survive', 'attacked', 'behind', 'very', 'thick', 'steel', 'nigh', 'impossible', 'get', 'complete', 'camera', 'surveillance', 'system', 'Naturally', 'robbers', 'were', 'expecting', 'room', 'be', 'empty', 'Foster', 'really', 'wrench', 'plans', 'What', ""'re"", 'room', 'just', 'so', 'one', 'robbers', 'installs', 'kinds', 'rooms', 'thus', 'enter', 'Forest', 'Whittaker', 'can', 'see', 'stage', 'set', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'ride', 'whole', 'movie', 'place', 'house', 'really', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere', 'else', 'alone', 'fairly', 'impressive', 'Seriously', 'stay', 'screen', 'two', 'hours', 'not', 'leave', 'same', 'location', 'pretty', 'good', 'writing', 'do', 'manage', 'pull', 'off', 'Not', 'mention', 'done', 'like', 'five', 'actors', 'sixth', 'enters', 'later', 'almost', 'lines.Despite', 'very', 'competent', 'acting', 'film', 'still', 'felt', 'tad', 'drawn', 'out', 'shock', 'hear', 'say', ""'m"", 'usually', 'guy', 'wanting', 'more', 'movie', 'suspense', 'was', 'certainly', 'great', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'However', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'watching', 'numerous', 'times', 'future', 'what', 'really', 'great', 'movie', 'okay', 'movie', 'did', 'interaction', 'robbers', 'most', 'once', 'realized', 'carefully', 'laid', 'plans', 'were', ""n't"", 'going', 'very', 'smooth', 'audience', 'meant', 'eventually', 'sympathize', 'Whittaker', 'character', 'thought', 'was', 'bit', 'interesting', 'twist', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Whittaker', 'would', 'make', 'really', 'good', 'down', 'dirty', 'robber', 'loads', 'violent', 'experience', 'Seriously', 'just', 'not', 'was', 'perfect', 'role', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'head', 'so', 'speak.I', 'think', 'definitely', 'movie', 'seeing', 'once', 'very', 'least', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Jodi', 'Foster', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'could', 'possibly', 'disappoint', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'hers', 'typically', 'enjoy', 'films', 'out', 'can', 'think', 'say', 'just', 'good', 'thrilling', 'suspenseful', 'movie', 'ask']",N/A

He adds a bit of paranoid messages into the film making it pretty interesting till the end. For instance, the heistin question involving the three thieves Burnham (Forest Whitaker), Raul (Dwight Yoakam), and Junior (Jared Leno) breaking into an unbreakable house which has a ''panic room'' (an unbreakable room for emergency). The ''panic room'' is like the 1990's version of the 1950 version of a panic room which paranoid people in that time used because of the so called threat of nuclear war. lolThe dilemna here is that Meg and her daughter are at the house at the same time the thieves are coming in. So Meg and Sarah hide in the ''panic room'' which yes hides the fortune the thieves are after. So while the thieves are trying to break into the panic room, the Altman's are trying to break out of the room (because the room is cutting of oxygen) and to contact the police for help.Fincher does managed to established a great clautrosphobic ( I think I spelled it right) atmosphere enabling to gasp for our breathes while Meg and Sarah try to conserve their last ones. The lighting of the movie also a certain atmosphere as well, as most of the shots in the movie look dark and gloomy giving us more chills and spills.The acting is great Jodie Foster does another fine performance in her career, whichI have admired for a long time. Here she pulls of the single mother fighting forthe life of her daughter routine very well. She likes all her other roles, doesgives that tough edge that makes her characters so real.Kristen Stewart is good too although she doesn't get too many lines.Forest Whitaker as Burnham and Jared Leno as Junior are the lead thieves who gives some laughs in between especially when these collide with another as to their next plan of attack on Meg.Burnham is a good character. Whats starts out as a typical thief, turns into a sympathetic character of a thief who perhaps is sick of the life of crime he has led, while Junior represents the most typical violent thief even, someone who continually robs and kills people with no conscience. He is another words like these guys on ''America's Most Wanted'' who gets profiled like a million times, almost taking pride in the fact that he loves being a menace to society''Panic Room'' by David Fincher is then obviously more than just a heist movie, Fincher puts in some critical factors that prevent from being just a standard crime movie. The characters are different than you would get in a typical movie of this genre.

Well that was how I felt after seeing this movie-in fact I began to feel that maybe I had the worst taste in films going!!I've really enjoyed Fincher's most recent films '7' and 'Fight Club' and what with Jodie Foster in the cast I was really looking forward to this film. The previews made it out to be a rollercoaster ride of tension and anxiety for the viewer. To be honest I found it barely palpable apart from a few brief moments where I got frustrated and slightly anxious as Foster gropes around for her cell-phone.The premise of the movie is really good-recently split from her mega-rich husband, Foster and her young teenage daughter (with an attitude!) seek to move into a new residence in Manhattan. The fact that this husband left her means that Foster can gain some sort of vengeance by exploiting his wealth by moving into this amazing house. This massive house full of winding stairs, old rattling windows, inevitable shadows and even better a service elevator also happens to have what is known as a panic room. This room is in fact an impenetrable room from which all the rest of the house can be viewed through a c.c.t.v. system. The fact that the house would have such a room in the first place would have made me pretty jumpy. So of course everyone  knows that Foster and her daughter would have to use this room at some stage-personally speaking I'd have left the daughter outside! Yet the fact that it happens so early in the film I feel has a limiting effect on developing a storyline or characters. The house is soon invaded by 3 of the most stereotypical burglars you could ever meet. They sort of reminded me of the two hapless burglars in the Home Alone movies! Forrest Whittaker is the burglar with a kind heart who only wants to feed his kids; Jarod Leto-the loudmouth clueless burglar and Dwight Yoakam is the cold-hearted psychopathic burglar who tries to maintain an aura of hopeless mystery.I did find myself intrigued as to how the situation could reslove itself-but after a while I simply didn't care what happened especially as events grew more and more farcical. Personally I began to pray that maybe the burglars would just give up and go home for a good nights sleep. The ending is a total anti-climax and whatever Fincher was thinking in the closing seconds before the credits as we zoom in closely on two of the characters faces (won't tell you who!) to an enormous crescendo of dramatic violins-I sort of left the cinema laughing loudly.

The panic room in this film had a door, similar to that of a bank vault, that could only be opened by those inside and had a supply of milk to last its residents for months. Jody Forster, a newly divorced woman, and her daughter move into a large house in the upper westside of Manhattan, and utilize their panic room in their first night in the house to hide from three burglers who invade their home looking for a cache of money hidden inside this room.Without giving away any more of the plot, I found this movie to be one of the dullest ""thrillers"" I have ever seen. It seemed that the film was made up entirely of bits and pieces of similar movies of this genre that were haphazardly pasted together. Two of the three thugs were total Neanderthals and the third, who had worked on constructing such panic rooms in the past, was the typical criminal with a heart of gold. He was the true professional and was in it only for the money. He was so good to Jodie, and especially to her daughter, that someone should have nominated him for the Nobel peace prize.

701171,A34CVPZ30BA4GD,B00006684S,James Robert Dator,"[26, 29]","David Fincher has always been a very visual director. He understands the most innovative and revolutionary film techniques to appeal to every sense. This is apparent in his films 'Se7en' and 'Fight Club'; however in this outing delivers a film that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats for 100 minutes in the thriller 'Panic Room'.The premise when first looked at is rather simple. Recently divorced mother Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) moves into a huge new house on Manhattan's West Side, which is not only enormous but has something most places don't; a panic room. This room is solid concrete, on top of steel, fixed out with surveillance cameras; in short nothing can get in, or out.On their first night Meg and daughter Sarah (Kirsten Stewart), whose relationship has been strained since the divorce, are awoken by three criminals (Jared Leto, Dwight Yokam, and the socially minded Forest Whitaker) who are hell bent in entering the house. Thus Meg and Sarah run into the panic room hidden behind a mirror in the master bedroom, expecting the thieves will ransack the house and leave. The plot twists from here, as the criminals actually want the 22 million dollars in bearer bonds hidden in a floor safe in the panic room. What ensues is an intense pseudo game of `hide and seek' with Meg and Sarah trapped by the three criminals.The characters that Fincher establishes are amazing. The film wouldn't have the same feel if Nicole Kidman (who was due to be cast) were in the role of Meg. It is the dichotomy Foster portrays between a sensitive, maternal Female, who is forced to react in a very masculine way. In this sense Foster plays a character much like Clarice in `Silence of the lambs', who's femininity in brought to the forefront but extenuous circumstances.Perhaps the single thing that strikes the audience and appeals to them is Fincher's mind blowing camera work. He uses the camera like another member of the cast, as the importance he imbues on the camera. The viewer is taken place conventional rigs could never take the viewer before. Into locks, between banisters, even a spiraling shot down the staircase that can only be resembled to Hitchcocks shot in `Vertigo'. David Fincher is a director who truly understands film as a visual medium. Lets face it there are times where his idea's could have flopped in `Panic Room' when an entire room is reconstructed with CG then the camera moves through it could have looked really hokey... but it works to great effect.My only criticism of the film is sometimes the pacing slows down a bit. Fincher's work always moves very quickly and I feel at times the middle of the film lagged a little; otherwise it was great.`Panic Room' is a fantastic piece of modern cinema. A great thriller that will keep the audience of the edge of their seats.

It's, evidently, where back-alley threats and urban terrorists attack the pure and virtuous wealthy New Yorkers.Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) and her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart) are living in a spacious Upper West Side brownstone town house, with architecture that reflects the priciest of pricy New York abodes - large and expensive enough for three or four young professionals to live in, and they'd still have to live off of ramen a few times per week.  Meg attained her home via the money-grubbing divorcee route, with real estate revenge as her sole purpose for even choosing the Richie Rich option in housing.In this ridiculously large home in which Meg and her daughter have ten times the room they truly need, there is no real need to furnish the house.  Instead, Meg is worried about her WASPish needs such as finding the corkscrew for her wine bottle, how to steal more money from her ex-husband, and, oh yeah, making sure she has enough diabetes medicine for her daughter.  On top of all the other opulence, they have a luxury above all other needless luxuries: a panic room.  This panic room is the amenity of all amenities, and for only the filthy rich.  It acts as a barricade for an extended period of time for any and all rich occupants, and via its Ft. Knox security and armaggedon stockage, all rich occupants remain safe from all non-rich people.In the case of this movie, I was kind of hoping that the criminals would win because the money and security clearly wasn't earned.  However, the three criminals in his movie aren't that lucky.  Burnham (Forest Whitaker) is a safe-cracking, goofy-as-hell yet somehow intelligent role tailor made for Forest Whitaker.  Junior (Jared Leto) is the ADD-riddled, get rich quick bad element generically typical in every psychological thriller.  And Raoul (Dwight Yoakam) is the heartless psychopath of the group, ubiquitous to this type of movie.  While fighting for power and control, the criminals build tension and suspense, allowing the viewer to not only choose sides between Meg and the villians, but also amongst the villians themselves.Generic maternal instinct provides determination enough to thwart the bad guys in a foreshadowed Lavergne and Shirley meets Jackass style of female empowerment ending.

701173,A3DE1IYJGU5HPW,B00006684S,Jason N. Mical,"[6, 7]","Few directors have the stylistic wit and independent ambition of David Fincher, whose previous films Fight Club and Se7en broke boundaries of taste and standards of what makes a film.  Both projects succeeded, and although Fincher's other works, like Alien 3 and The Game were less successful, it hasn't stopped him from picking some of the most difficult films in mainstream cinema.  Panic Room, written by David Koepp, reflects that.  Based on a slim premise - that of a woman stuck in a sealed ""panic room"" in her new apartment while a band of crooks threatens her outside - Fincher manages to direct a picture with a string-tightening tension reminiscent of Hitchcock.The story seems a little like Home Alone for adults: after a messy divorce, Meg Altman (Foster) and her diabetic daughter Sarah (newcomer Kristen Stewart) find what seems like a dream apartment on the Upper West Side: four stores, all the amenities, and a special ""panic room"" with its own power, phone, and video surveillance of the house.  When the son of the now-dead former owner leads a band of thugs into the apartment on the first night to recover something, Meg find the room quite useful - until she realizes what the thugs want is in that room.  The rest of the film is a contest between Meg and the thugs to try and outwit each other and live through the night.  With each dark shot, each new plan, and each whittling away of will and strength, the situation continues to get more and more desperate, and Fincher masterfully tightens the noose of suspense.The computer-to-camera effects Fincher pioneered in Fight Club return here, taking the all-seeing eye through floors, walls, tiny drains, mug-handles, and railings.  Whereas in Fight Club it was stylistic and essential to the story, in Panic Room it seems more of a distraction.  The final ending, too, is weak: after such a gut-wrenching film, one feels let down.  Suspense films are based on the payoff at the end, and it's in those final moments that Panic Room fails to deliver.  For all Panic Room has going for it, it's a shame that it couldn't have found a better ending.",4,Great Movie Ruined by Weak Ending,1017705600,"04 2, 2002",2002,2117,"['Few', 'directors', 'have', 'stylistic', 'wit', 'independent', 'ambition', 'David', 'Fincher', 'previous', 'films', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Se7en', 'broke', 'boundaries', 'taste', 'standards', 'what', 'film', 'projects', 'succeeded', 'Fincher', 'other', 'works', 'Alien', '3', 'Game', 'were', 'less', 'successful', ""n't"", 'stopped', 'picking', 'most', 'difficult', 'films', 'mainstream', 'cinema', 'Panic', 'Room', 'written', 'David', 'Koepp', 'Based', 'slim', 'premise', 'woman', 'stuck', 'sealed', 'panic', 'room', 'new', 'apartment', 'band', 'crooks', 'outside', 'manages', 'direct', 'picture', 'string-tightening', 'tension', 'reminiscent', 'Hitchcock.The', 'story', 'little', 'like', 'Home', 'Alone', 'adults', 'messy', 'divorce', 'Meg', 'Altman', 'Foster', 'diabetic', 'daughter', 'Sarah', 'newcomer', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'find', 'what', 'dream', 'apartment', 'Upper', 'West', 'Side', 'four', 'stores', 'amenities', 'special', 'panic', 'room', 'own', 'power', 'phone', 'video', 'surveillance', 'house', 'When', 'son', 'now-dead', 'former', 'owner', 'band', 'thugs', 'apartment', 'first', 'night', 'recover', 'something', 'Meg', 'find', 'room', 'quite', 'useful', 'what', 'thugs', 'want', 'room', 'rest', 'film', 'contest', 'Meg', 'thugs', 'try', 'outwit', 'other', 'live', 'night', 'dark', 'shot', 'new', 'plan', 'whittling', 'away', 'will', 'strength', 'situation', 'get', 'more', 'more', 'desperate', 'Fincher', 'masterfully', 'noose', 'suspense.The', 'computer-to-camera', 'effects', 'Fincher', 'pioneered', 'Fight', 'Club', 'return', 'here', 'taking', 'all-seeing', 'eye', 'floors', 'walls', 'tiny', 'drains', 'mug-handles', 'railings', 'Whereas', 'Fight', 'Club', 'was', 'stylistic', 'essential', 'story', 'Panic', 'Room', 'more', 'distraction', 'final', 'ending', 'too', 'weak', 'gut-wrenching', 'film', 'one', 'feels', 'let', 'down', 'Suspense', 'films', 'are', 'based', 'payoff', 'end', 'final', 'moments', 'Panic', 'Room', 'deliver', 'Panic', 'Room', 'going', 'shame', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'found', 'better', 'ending']",N/A

701175,A3HB5BTD9VHDS8,B00006684S,"""jbridell""","[0, 2]","My problems with Panic Room started at the credits, a weird sort of 3D modeling where the names of the players and writers, etc., are on strange, beveled 3D letters put over New York buildings, it looked like something done in Bryce. If you are reading this it is safe to assume that you know the premise, a recently divorced mother of one is the victim of a home invasion and hides in an impenetrable cubby hole designed by the former tenant, a paranoid old man, a film like this needs three things, great actors, good directing and camera work, and a convincing story and believable dialogue, Panic room has two of these.  Jodie Foster and Forest Whiticer (Spelling)?are as good as ever, Whiticker as the long suffering ""Good crook,"" in the ""good crook, bad crook"" drama that unfolds from the first time we see the intruders.  The director of ""Seven"" gives us lots and lots of cool camera moves and great lighting, menacing blue and lots of shadows and light, but sadly this cannot cover the silly script and forced plot, we just don't believe it.  Many, many times the crooks banter floats off into unintentional humor, there was some laughing on the part of the audience at places we know were supposed to be serious, and way too often we see a character do one thing and then another, for no reason other then the script calls for it.  Foster is great at gasping, panicking and protecting her cub like the lion hearted actress we all know and love, but when she is given a chance, I thought, to do something she doesn't.  The daughter is a very fine young actress who could have been sappy as the diabetic little girl, she has spunk and some good lines but mostly she is there to be rescued.  The over done film school shots of the ""Clues"" at the beginning (The camera zooms in on the insulin in the fridge, and we see Jodie has bare feet, with a foot close up) are obvious set ups and when the pay off comes we have all seen it coming. Many, many times a phone or a gun are just out of reach, this wears thin.  Then there is the ceaseless ""suspense music"" that would have been over done in a radio drama, too much, too loud, too bad, I hope Jodie Foster does better next time, I am sure she will, it wasn't bad, but two out of three just doesn't cut it.",3,"Close, but not quite there....",1017360000,"03 29, 2002",2002,2259,"['problems', 'Panic', 'Room', 'started', 'credits', 'weird', 'sort', '3D', 'modeling', 'where', 'names', 'players', 'writers', 'etc.', 'are', 'strange', 'beveled', '3D', 'letters', 'put', 'over', 'New', 'York', 'buildings', 'looked', 'something', 'done', 'Bryce', 'are', 'reading', 'safe', 'assume', 'know', 'premise', 'recently', 'divorced', 'mother', 'one', 'victim', 'home', 'invasion', 'hides', 'impenetrable', 'cubby', 'hole', 'designed', 'former', 'tenant', 'paranoid', 'old', 'man', 'film', 'three', 'things', 'great', 'actors', 'good', 'directing', 'camera', 'work', 'convincing', 'story', 'believable', 'dialogue', 'Panic', 'room', 'two', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Forest', 'Whiticer', 'Spelling', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'ever', 'Whiticker', 'long', 'suffering', 'Good', 'crook', 'good', 'crook', 'bad', 'crook', 'drama', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'intruders', 'director', 'Seven', 'lots', 'lots', 'cool', 'camera', 'moves', 'great', 'lighting', 'menacing', 'blue', 'lots', 'shadows', 'light', 'sadly', 'can', 'not', 'cover', 'silly', 'script', 'forced', 'plot', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Many', 'many', 'times', 'crooks', 'banter', 'floats', 'off', 'unintentional', 'humor', 'was', 'laughing', 'part', 'audience', 'places', 'know', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'serious', 'way', 'too', 'often', 'see', 'character', 'do', 'one', 'thing', 'then', 'reason', 'other', 'then', 'script', 'Foster', 'great', 'gasping', 'panicking', 'protecting', 'cub', 'lion', 'hearted', 'know', 'love', 'when', 'given', 'chance', 'thought', 'do', 'something', ""n't"", 'daughter', 'very', 'fine', 'young', 'actress', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'sappy', 'diabetic', 'little', 'girl', 'spunk', 'good', 'lines', 'mostly', 'there', 'be', 'rescued', 'done', 'film', 'school', 'shots', 'Clues', 'beginning', 'camera', 'insulin', 'fridge', 'see', 'Jodie', 'bare', 'feet', 'foot', 'close', 'are', 'obvious', 'set', 'ups', 'when', 'pay', 'off', 'have', 'seen', 'coming', 'Many', 'many', 'times', 'phone', 'gun', 'are', 'just', 'reach', 'thin', 'Then', 'ceaseless', 'suspense', 'music', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'radio', 'drama', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'loud', 'too', 'bad', 'hope', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'better', 'next', 'time', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'two', 'three', 'just', ""n't"", 'cut']",N/A

On their first night there, three guys break in looking for '3 million' dollars which is located in the panic room. Unfortunately Jodie sees them on the camers in the panic room when she goes to turn everything off in their and stuff, so she runs and gets her daughter, & they run and get in the panic room. Now since they r in it, the robbers can't get in it. So over intercom Jodie tells them to 'get out of my house' & they tell her why they're there. Jodie and her daughter refuse to ever come out. Unfortunately they try putting gas in there to scare them out, so Jodie lights a lighter & blows the gas up into the gascontainer & the guys get hurt instead. But then her daughter goes into diabetic shock...she needs insulin. So when Jodie thinks she can make it to her daughter's room where a refrigerator (mini one) is by her bed, the two 'remaining' guys get in there with the daughter. Luckily Jodie throws in the bag of needles and insulin bottles into the panic room right before the door shuts. One of the guys is nice enough to give the girl the shot. When the two guys aren't looking, the little girl hides the needles behind her back.

Panic Room does this cleverly.The film engages the viewer and makes them think about what they've just seen. It doesn't just come right out and explain everything to the viewer.  The film challenges its viewers to pay attention and realize the significance of what they saw.An example is the shot of the daughter's Refrigerator in her rooom. If you're clever and paying atttention you immediately undertstand it's significance. It may become clear when Jody warns her daughter not to get too excited. Or later notice the daughter's unusual ""watch"". More clues when her daughter warns her mom she's getting hungry...Finally, the fridge's significance finally dawns when Jody frantically looks through the boxes after the daughter's watch has gone off.Ok, so the viewer's suspension of disbelief kinda dips when Jody reaches in the vent for the telephone wire and it's marked right there inside the vent. Would a phone line really be marked there?  And all that work Jody does to get back to the refrigerator and she gets the wrong item but the movie makes it out to be the correct one.  But the rest of the movie is so good it doesn't detract from the film's enjoyment even if it is noticed.The shot of jody crying in the tub and gulping down a huge glass of wine.The shot of the key in the front door going in and then out.No explainations or dialogue. Just shots of things that actually mean something significant to the story telling.The cinematography is likewise clever. The shot of the camera going through the kitchen table, the floor, the vents are just ways the film's technology frees itself from the fixed camera (much as the director of the Matrix proclaimed it would). It's just another enjoyable element in the film and more importantly, it still serves as a purpose to the story telling (unlike the Matrix, whose cinematography was mainly about oohs and ahhs).All in all Panic Room's a blast.

The home was previously owned by a multimillionaire who installed a Safe Room which in this film is called a Panic Room.  It is a steel and concrete walled room with a steel door and wired for live video of the home, ventilation system, security and a telephone.On the first night they move into the new home it is broken into by Junior (Jared Leto), the grandson of the former owner.  He has recruited Burnham (Forest Whitaker) an employee of the security company that manages the safety of the home and a sadistic gunman named Raoul (Dwight Yoakam) who has experience. The alarm is set and the family is in bed.  The break in is part of a plan to steal millions of dollars of bearer bonds that are hidden in a safe in the Panic Room and nobody knows about their existence but Junior and his team.The burglars think the home is empty but are surprised to find that they are not alone in the house.  Meg is not sleeping well and when she turns off a light she sees them in the video monitors and hears them as one of them accidently kicks a basketball.  She grabs her daughter and they run but finally make it into the Panic Room and close the steel door with just seconds to spare.  They try the  phone in the safe room and realize that they never hooked up a second line....This is an intense and suspenseful film about a standoff between a mother protecting her child and herself and desperate criminals who will do anything to win.  Jody foster just played this role to perfection. (Doesn't she always!)  She almost always plays the intelligent protagonist in the film and this script was made for her.  I also liked the actors who played the criminals.  They all did a good job and if made the film powerfully gripping.I loved this movie and I thought it was very well done.

Even the movies that are BASED on real life get stuck with all sorts of crap to embellish the plot.My son and I watched ""Panic Room"" the other night. At first, I thought that it would be a pretty good flick. That thought faded away rather quickly. This room was supposed to be impenetrable. By the end of the movie, there were more ways to disable the occupants of that ""impenetrable"" room than there are gates at Disney World.Here they had a room that was supposed to be surrounded by concrete and steel yet the neighbor heard the screaming from the room and complained to police about it. The air system was compromised. There was a hole in the wall that led directly outside, wires from the outside could be reached from the inside. It was a freaking joke.I would rather take my chances face to face than depend on a room like that. Whoever wrote the script should be barred from ever writing again. The only good thing that we got out of the movie was that we agreed it was stupid. We were just sitting there talking about how stupid it was and before we knew it, it got even MORE stupid.

The visual style and camera movements are to be praised to no end, as are the performances by Jodie Foster and Forest Whitaker.  Past that, the movie gets bogged down when the burglars (excluding Whitaker) are on screen.  Not only are Yoakam and Leto discordant compared to Whitaker's acting realism, but their characters are right out the formula book.  Leto is the braggart that wants to run things when Whitaker is clearly the intelligent one, and Yoakam is the token loose cannon that Leto brings along unannounced.  The ending is decent, which is usually tough for movies like this.Having said that, I think Panic Room could become something of a minor classic with two good actors and inventive direction from David Fincher.  Fincher reminds me of the young Brian DePalma who always did well with average material.As far as the SuperBit compression, I couldn't tell a difference on my regular television.

701187,A25RN8X70DSZLU,B00006684S,JRP,"[0, 1]","Ending The March series of 2002 in film & 20 years ago  I'm going to review Panic Room. This is a neat movie I've always though. Directed by David Fincher he directed Alien 3 which most people hate but I like Alien 3 despite it's shortcomings. He also directed Seven & Zobiac. It stars Jodie Foster as Meg Altman, Kristen Stewart as Sarah Altman, Dwight Yoakam as Raoul, Forest Whittaker as Burnham, Jared Leto as Junior & Patrck Bauchau as Stephen Altman. The story is about this single Mother Meg Altman & her Daughter Sarah who have moved to this nice upscale house in New York City. During the tour they take a look at the panic room which you get an idea of what the movie is about. The night they move in while they are asleep 2 men break into the house Burnham & Junior he is the Grandson of the previous owner. Burnham works for the security company that made the panic room in the house. Then another guy comes in Raoul who wears a ski masks & carries a silenced pistol. They find out that people live in the house they argue over it they convince Burnham to continue. The thing is Burnham doesn't want anybody killed. Meg wakes up & discovers that there are people in the house on the security camera. So she goes & wakes up her daughter their chased by the robbers they use the elevator to evade them they eventually get back to the top floor & into the panic room. There's 1 problem for them though the panic room has it's own phone line & it hasn't benn connected. So these robbers try a lot of stuff to get into that room. Burnham decides to gas the vents to get them out Meg tries to seal the the vents which doesn't work. Raoul turns up the gas. Meg grabs some fire proof blankets she covers herself & Sarah. She takes a lighter & causes a blast through the vents. Junior's arm catches fire. Meg & Sarah try anything to get help. Sarah uses a flashlight throught a hole to use as a signal for help. Then you have a well done suspense scene the robbers are arguing among themeselves Meg gets out of the panic room to get her cell phone a lamp falls off of the nightstand which alerts the robbers she grabs her cell phone & hurries back into the room. But there is no signal in the room for a cell phone so they have the same  d  a  m  n problems as before. So there only hop is to rig a pnone line the robbers go to the basement to try & cut the line Meg calls 911 but they put her on hold. Sarah says try calling Dad. Meg calls her ex she gets his new girlfirend she says""B  i  t  c  h put me on the phone with Stephen!"" She tells him that there are 3 people on the house before the phone goes dead. Junior has given up he lets it slip that there is more than $3 million in the vault. Sarah is suffering from a low blood sugar & has suffered a seizure. Then outside of the room Junior is leaving but he is shot in the head by Raoul. Stepehen shows up & he is taken hostage by Raoul he orders Burnham to finish the job. Burnham puts Stephen's ID up to the camera. Raoul puts his mask on Stephen to trick her. Meg goes to get a Glucagion shot she hurries back where Raoul grabs her she throws Dwight Yoakam on hisa  z  z. Raoul & Burnham get into the panic room Meg throws the medical kit into the room before the door shuts & it closes on Raoul's hand. Burnham sees Sarah on the floor & he wants to help her. Outside of the room Meg grabs the gun that Raoul had. Cops arrive Stephen called them before he went to their house. She has to lie to the cops cause the robbers told her to. It's actually a pretty funny scene. Burnham gives Sarah the injection. They get the safe open & find $22 million in bearer bonds. Meg takes a sledgehammer & knocks out the camera's. Burnham & Raoul try to escape they use Sarah as a hostage. They run into a badly hurt Stephen sitting in a chair he points a gun at them. Then Meg comes from behind Sarah gets out of the way Meg hits Raoul with a sledgehammer he's knocked down the stairs. Burnham gets out of there Raoul gets back up they have a struggle Stephen tries to shoot him but misses Raoul takes him down. Sarah tries to do something but she is thrown across the room. Raoul takes the sledgehammer & tries to kill Meg. While Burnham tries to escape he hears Sarah's screams he comes back in grabs the gun on the floor & shoots Raoul in the head. The police arrive Burham is arrested he lets the bearer bonds fly away. It goes to sometime later with Meg & Sarah searching for a new home. Other than some of the CGI which I will always pick on CGI & the burglers except for Forest Whittaker they didn't have a lot of interest. As well there is no mention of what happend to Stephen I really enjoyed this movie 2 character that you cared about the whole premise neat. I like the 1 location films that use suspense. David Fincher did a really good job directing. Jodie Foster did a good job. Kristen Stewart this is the 1 time I can say she is a pretty good actress. Dwight Yoakam was ok. Jared Leto was there again nothing going for him. Forest Whitaker did a good job. Patrick Bauchau wasn't in it a lot but he was alright.

They say: ""Jodie Foster's character should have done this, should have done that, the bad guys didn't notice this and that, there's a plot-hole in this part..."".I just want to remind them that ""Panic room"" is a FICTION MOVIE. THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE REAL. That's what enterteinment is about. ""Panic room"" is a thriller, right? So, in a thriller, the script is written in such a way that the viewers WILL BE THRILLED. Of course, the writers attempt to attain their script to reality as long as they can, but sometimes they have to forsake reality to provide their movie with some parts that will simply be transformed in scenes that will create on the audience the effect they expect.I just want to know what do reviewers that gave poor rating to this movie on grounds of plot-incredibility think of movies like ""Harry Potter"", ""Lord of the rings"" and others alike. If they are coherent, they also despise these movies, and all they want to watch are czech-polish movies about the lives of two old seamstresses escaping Lithuania during the second world war (this is an example, I'm not saying that czech movies or polish movies are bad, they just usually are not  action thrillers). What I want to say is, ""Panic room"" is good enterteinment, it's a movie that leaves you with your eyes wide open every scene, and you just want to know what's going to happen next.

701192,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B00006684S,Kaya Savas,"[4, 4]","MOVIE: David Koepp (Who wrote the screenplay) must have been seeking a challenge or something when he decided to cook this morsel up. How do you make a movie compelling when the only setting is a manhattan town home, when the main characters are stuck in one room throughout the majority of the movie, and when there are no major stunt sequences or gunfights? How do you? You get David Fincher to direct, that's how! The movie has the simplest premise yet the movie is tense and entertaining. I remember seeing the trailer for the first time and I kind of though ""what a stupid idea that is"", but I was wrong.  What Fincher did with this movie is made the house a character of its own, the audience sees the town home from almost every angle possible, and the camera never stops.  Most of the shots are CG, but the effect is astounding and without it would make this movie a sleeper.  Fincher is still an amateur in my eyes, but every movie he's done (which is only a few) have been fantastic.  The movie itself is one of the few that will keep you watching not because of the acting or the story but of the camera work, and the audience will never even know it.VIDEO: The movie is presented in an anamorphic widescreen at a 2.40:1 ratio.  The movie is dark, very dark, and I think the video turned out great. The dark colors come out nicely. I don't see any downgrade from the Superbit version released two years ago. The video was also mastered in High Definition, so if you own a HD set and a progressive scan DVD player then you'll have the benefit. Pretty Good!AUDIO: The mix is good it's a 5.1 DD, and the sound effects come out sharp and crisp. The real sound is from Howard Shore's subtle score that is highly effective. You can listen to the film in Spanish and French too. Overall sharp and clear and top notch!PACKAGING / EXTRAS: The set comes in one of the most original box I've seen, and it's great. When you slide out the piece from the slip cover it opens up two flaps and in the center we have three discs one after another in a clear digipak case, and you can flip them like a book. They aren't cheaply made and look pretty sturdy.  As for the extras we get a load of them. The Superbit release two years ago only had a trailer, and that was pathetic.  Now we have one of the most extensive looks into a film ever compiled onto a DVD.  This puppy can be stacked up with LOTR and Pearl Harbor in terms of extras.  On disc 1 we get the movie and the options, and we get three commentaries by the director, stars, and writer.  We also get the trailer and plus a few other trailers for classic movies from Columbia / Tri-star.  On disc 2 we get Pre-Production which consists of 6 featurettes pre-production, interactive pre-visualizations (i.e. storyboards compared with different shots and the final). In Production we get a one hour long documentary on the principal photography, and a makeup effects featurette. On disc 3 we get the second half of Production and in that we have sequence breakdowns.  Then we have the Post-Production section that consists of 21 documentaries and featurettes that focus on post visual effects work, Sound Design featurette, Digital Intermediate featurettes, Musical Score breakdown, and some other minor things.  Overall this one is a whopper, a very well made DVD, worth the money even if you have the original. If you haven't seen it then I recommend this set highly, and if you're interested in film making then I order you to get it cause the ""making of"" doesn't get any better than this.MOVIE SCORE: (* * * *) / 5 StarsDVD SCORE: (10/10)",4,The Simplest Plots Make The Most Entertaining,1080864000,"04 2, 2004",2004,3592,"['MOVIE', 'David', 'Koepp', 'Who', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'seeking', 'challenge', 'something', 'when', 'decided', 'cook', 'morsel', 'up', 'How', 'do', 'make', 'movie', 'compelling', 'when', 'only', 'setting', 'manhattan', 'town', 'home', 'when', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'stuck', 'one', 'room', 'majority', 'movie', 'when', 'are', 'major', 'stunt', 'sequences', 'gunfights', 'How', 'do', 'get', 'David', 'Fincher', 'direct', 'how', 'movie', 'simplest', 'premise', 'yet', 'movie', 'tense', 'entertaining', 'remember', 'seeing', 'trailer', 'first', 'time', 'kind', 'what', 'stupid', 'idea', 'was', 'wrong', 'What', 'Fincher', 'did', 'movie', 'made', 'house', 'character', 'own', 'audience', 'town', 'home', 'almost', 'angle', 'possible', 'camera', 'never', 'stops', 'Most', 'shots', 'are', 'CG', 'effect', 'astounding', 'would', 'make', 'movie', 'sleeper', 'Fincher', 'still', 'amateur', 'eyes', 'movie', 'done', 'only', 'few', 'have', 'been', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'one', 'few', 'will', 'keep', 'watching', 'not', 'acting', 'story', 'camera', 'work', 'audience', 'will', 'never', 'even', 'know', 'it.VIDEO', 'movie', 'presented', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', '2.40:1', 'ratio', 'movie', 'dark', 'very', 'dark', 'think', 'video', 'turned', 'out', 'great', 'dark', 'colors', 'come', 'out', 'nicely', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'downgrade', 'Superbit', 'version', 'released', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'video', 'was', 'also', 'mastered', 'High', 'Definition', 'so', 'own', 'HD', 'set', 'progressive', 'scan', 'DVD', 'player', 'then', ""'ll"", 'have', 'benefit', 'Pretty', 'Good', 'AUDIO', 'mix', 'good', '5.1', 'DD', 'sound', 'effects', 'come', 'out', 'sharp', 'crisp', 'real', 'sound', 'Howard', 'Shore', 'subtle', 'score', 'highly', 'effective', 'can', 'listen', 'film', 'Spanish', 'French', 'too', 'Overall', 'sharp', 'clear', 'top', 'notch', 'PACKAGING', '/', 'EXTRAS', 'set', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'box', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'great', 'When', 'slide', 'out', 'piece', 'slip', 'cover', 'up', 'two', 'flaps', 'center', 'have', 'three', 'discs', 'one', 'clear', 'digipak', 'case', 'can', 'flip', 'book', 'are', ""n't"", 'cheaply', 'made', 'look', 'pretty', 'sturdy', 'extras', 'get', 'load', 'Superbit', 'release', 'two', 'years', 'only', 'had', 'trailer', 'was', 'pathetic', 'Now', 'have', 'one', 'most', 'extensive', 'looks', 'film', 'ever', 'compiled', 'DVD', 'puppy', 'can', 'be', 'stacked', 'up', 'LOTR', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'terms', 'extras', 'disc', '1', 'get', 'movie', 'options', 'get', 'three', 'commentaries', 'director', 'stars', 'writer', 'also', 'get', 'trailer', 'few', 'other', 'trailers', 'classic', 'movies', 'Columbia', '/', 'Tri-star', 'disc', '2', 'get', 'Pre-Production', '6', 'featurettes', 'pre-production', 'interactive', 'pre-visualizations', 'i.e', 'storyboards', 'compared', 'different', 'shots', 'final', 'Production', 'get', 'one', 'hour', 'long', 'documentary', 'principal', 'photography', 'makeup', 'effects', 'featurette', 'disc', '3', 'get', 'second', 'half', 'Production', 'have', 'sequence', 'breakdowns', 'Then', 'have', 'Post-Production', 'section', '21', 'documentaries', 'focus', 'post', 'visual', 'effects', 'work', 'Sound', 'Design', 'featurette', 'Digital', 'Intermediate', 'featurettes', 'Musical', 'Score', 'breakdown', 'other', 'minor', 'things', 'Overall', 'one', 'whopper', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'DVD', 'money', 'even', 'have', 'original', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'then', 'recommend', 'set', 'highly', ""'re"", 'interested', 'film', 'making', 'then', 'order', 'get', 'cause', 'making', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'this.MOVIE', 'SCORE', '*', '*', '*', '*', '/', '5', 'StarsDVD', 'SCORE', '10/10']",N/A

Nicole Kidman was suppose to play the star role, but with her injury in Moulin Rouge, Fincher asked Jodie Foster to do it and I heard she didn't really want to play this role, but after watching the making of it on the bonus DVD's, she was really looking forward to it...I had to re-purchase this movie though in the 3-Disc Special Edition though once I found out that Columbia re-released it...Which is very much worth it if anybody owns the 2-Disc Collector's Edition of Fight Club which I thought was out of print, but found about 8 copies of it at a Best Buy location.  Panic Room being a movie about home invasion and what the three men want (Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto, & Dwight Yoakum) are in the panic room and Foster and her kid (Kristen Stewart) do not let them in.  The three men begin to find their own ways to get into the panic room, using a small gas tank and gas them out to just giving them the finger on camera and cussing at them from outside.  Their situation gets more horrifying when Foster's husband in the movie visits them after a frightening phone call.  He gets beaten to death on camera while Foster and her kid watches painfully.  The tragic  ending involves two of the men dead and one escaping with the  money that was hidden in the floor panel of the panic room.  Foster and her kid find a new place in New York City.  Fincher made a great MAZE of a movie in this dark movie of home invasion.

Quido ""quidrock""","[1, 2]","of excellence you've come to expect from Director David Fincher.Panic Room has been transferred to DVD using Superbit technology, and the DVD visuals and sound are superb.  Fincher  used stunning camera work to capture the almost malevolent feel of the house that luckless mom, Jodie Foster, purchases in Manhattan, following a divorce from her powerful husband.  The room in question, upstairs in the house, has been built for a siege, of solid concrete and steel, with survival contents and surveillance cameras.Meg, Foster's character, has a teenage daughter, Sarah (Kirsten Stewart in a superb performance).  They are lucky to awake and get to the panic room on the night that three intruders invade the house.  Unfortunately, the intruders know more about the secrets held in the Panic Room than do Meg and Sarah.  The home invaders (Jared Leto, Dwight Yoakam and Forest Whitaker) are an unlikely bunch, and their unfortunate partnership leads to several mishaps in their quest to unglue the women from the Panic Room, in order to obtain the fortune that lies hidden there.  Because they seem to be bunglers (and perhaps because Leto &amp; Yoakam are miscast), viewers are shocked at the speed and nature of the violence that occurs.Billed as a suspenseful thriller, Panic Room has its moments of suspense, but tends to disappoint as the action drags.  The brilliant filming holds your attention, and Foster is in her element as a strong woman who will fight to defend her daughter, no matter what the cost.  I think the screenwriter was unable to create the suspense the setting and the players deserved, and so instead, the viewers have several ""why did they do that....they're so stupid!"" moments.  You didn't see those moments in Hitchcock films, because he knew how to deliver suspense in a way that had you living it with the character, not able to spot actions that would lead to disaster.

Heavy colors, heavy drapes, heavy facial expressions; heavy rain, darkened corners, unfinished walls.  With all that &quot;atmosphere,&quot; you'd think we had the beginnings of a frightfully engaging film.  After all, this is a movie about a mother (and a darn good actress, Jodie Foster) and daughter (who happens to be an insulin-dependent diabetic) crammed into a small cement and steel room as some big, bad wolves lurk outside ready to jump.But all of this lovely set-up is for naught.  Foster's acting is flat, closer to her work in the abysmal Contact.  Sure, we get to see her scientifically enhanced cleavage, but that is about the only thing that is revealed about her character.  One of the problems is that Foster's character is dimwitted and depressed, not exactly a formula for an engaging heroine.  And if Foster is rather dumb, she looks like a genius compared to the bumbling crooks who are trying to steal money from her house.Panic Room is filled with cliches and marginal performances.

701205,A2QGP7E8LSC7TG,B00006684S,Mark Baum,"[1, 1]","I'm a huge fan of David Fincher's work. To me his best movies happen to be ""SE7EN"", ""Fight Club' and ""Zodiac"". And while ""Panic Room"" is a good flick it doesn't hold up well to post-viewing analysis.There is much that can be considered to be quite contrived. For example her daughter who goes into diabetic shock if she doesn't get her emergency injection. Or the typical scene where her ex shows up to try to rescue them. I could go on but those are two examples that remain in my mind. Even the ending is rather anticlimactic in light of what was viewed.So why watch this if the plot relies on clich&eacute;s? As Fincher proved in his numerous works he is a master of setting up some very good camera shots and ""impossible"" camera moves. And while it's all the more obvious that he's relying upon CGI (the shot of the flashlight within the wiring conduit is a prime example of overuse) some are just simply very interesting to view. Such as the opening traveling shot which is essentially a tour of the house. The camera appears to float around from upstairs to downstairs and even pass through the handle of a coffee mug in one unbroken take and is fairly seamless until it ""passes through"" the floors. The opening credits deserve a quick mention as the titles are laid out among the buildings of New York and perfectly rendered in a silvery font and casting shadows across the cityscape as through they're part of the landscape. It's an attempt at style attempting to cover up the lack of substance, though. It's still neat to view.The acting is top notch from all involved. The standout is Dwight Yoakam's character who elevates the stakes as a psychotic killer who doesn't mind killing off one of his crew in cold blood. Forrest Whittaker holds his own as he tries to keep the situation from spiraling further out of control as the leader of the burglary gang. And I have no complaints about Jodie Foster's performance. It doesn't come close to her role in ""Silence Of The Lambs"" but it's still serviceable.But why the high rating? The three-disc special edition is something worth savoring for anyone who wants to know more about David Fincher and his crew's creative process. Much is revealed as to the use of CGI, the location shooting, sound design and much more. From top to bottom this is one of the most detailed documents of how the movie was put together. Compared to the two-disc edition of ""SE7EN"" this is even more detailed. The multiple feature commentaries are good but the special features spread across two additional discs are by far more in-depth. Compared to the 2-disc special editions of ""Fight Club"", ""Zodiac"" and even ""Benjamin Button"" I have a feeling that the need to overcompensate was mandatory for a rather average thriller.So it's an average movie just chock full of neo-noir eye candy. There are much worse ""thrillers"" out there so it could've been much worse. But the extensive features concerning the filmmaking process are worth viewing. Compared to the original single-disc SuperBit release it's an improvement. If you're a film geek then this is worth a purchase. Everyone else should stick with the single-disc release.",4,Not the best thriller but an outstanding special edition!,1259625600,"12 1, 2009",2009,3161,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'David', 'Fincher', 'work', 'best', 'movies', 'happen', 'be', 'SE7EN', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Zodiac', 'Panic', 'Room', 'good', 'flick', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'well', 'post-viewing', 'analysis.There', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'be', 'quite', 'contrived', 'example', 'daughter', 'who', 'diabetic', 'shock', ""n't"", 'get', 'emergency', 'injection', 'typical', 'scene', 'where', 'ex', 'up', 'try', 'rescue', 'could', 'go', 'are', 'two', 'examples', 'remain', 'mind', 'Even', 'ending', 'rather', 'anticlimactic', 'light', 'what', 'was', 'viewed.So', 'why', 'watch', 'plot', 'relies', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'Fincher', 'proved', 'numerous', 'works', 'master', 'setting', 'up', 'very', 'good', 'camera', 'shots', 'impossible', 'camera', 'moves', 'more', 'obvious', 'relying', 'CGI', 'shot', 'flashlight', 'wiring', 'conduit', 'prime', 'example', 'overuse', 'are', 'just', 'simply', 'very', 'interesting', 'view', 'Such', 'opening', 'traveling', 'shot', 'essentially', 'tour', 'house', 'camera', 'float', 'upstairs', 'downstairs', 'even', 'pass', 'handle', 'coffee', 'mug', 'one', 'unbroken', 'take', 'fairly', 'seamless', 'floors', 'opening', 'credits', 'deserve', 'quick', 'mention', 'titles', 'are', 'laid', 'out', 'buildings', 'New', 'York', 'perfectly', 'rendered', 'silvery', 'font', 'casting', 'shadows', 'cityscape', ""'re"", 'part', 'landscape', 'attempt', 'style', 'attempting', 'cover', 'up', 'lack', 'substance', 'though', 'still', 'neat', 'view.The', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'involved', 'standout', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'character', 'who', 'stakes', 'psychotic', 'killer', 'who', ""n't"", 'mind', 'killing', 'off', 'one', 'crew', 'cold', 'blood', 'Forrest', 'Whittaker', 'own', 'keep', 'situation', 'spiraling', 'further', 'control', 'leader', 'burglary', 'gang', 'have', 'complaints', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'performance', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'role', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'still', 'serviceable.But', 'why', 'high', 'rating', 'three-disc', 'special', 'edition', 'something', 'worth', 'savoring', 'anyone', 'who', 'know', 'more', 'David', 'Fincher', 'crew', 'creative', 'process', 'Much', 'revealed', 'use', 'CGI', 'location', 'shooting', 'sound', 'design', 'much', 'more', 'top', 'bottom', 'one', 'most', 'detailed', 'documents', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'Compared', 'two-disc', 'edition', 'SE7EN', 'even', 'more', 'detailed', 'multiple', 'feature', 'commentaries', 'are', 'good', 'special', 'features', 'spread', 'two', 'additional', 'discs', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'in-depth', 'Compared', '2-disc', 'special', 'editions', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Zodiac', 'even', 'Benjamin', 'Button', 'have', 'feeling', 'need', 'overcompensate', 'was', 'mandatory', 'rather', 'average', 'thriller.So', 'average', 'movie', 'just', 'chock', 'full', 'neo-noir', 'eye', 'candy', 'are', 'much', 'worse', 'thrillers', 'there', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'much', 'worse', 'extensive', 'features', 'concerning', 'filmmaking', 'process', 'are', 'worth', 'viewing', 'Compared', 'original', 'single-disc', 'SuperBit', 'release', 'improvement', ""'re"", 'film', 'geek', 'then', 'purchase', 'Everyone', 'else', 'should', 'stick', 'single-disc', 'release']",N/A
701206,ASU3THM5ZUTUI,B00006684S,"Mark Lee ""Peacemaker""","[2, 2]","Recently divorced Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) and her teenage daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart) are looking for a new place to live, and they decide on a majestic Manhattan mansion. The mansion is unlike anything they've ever seen, but its most distinguishing feature is a secret ""panic room,"" a secure shelter just off the master bedroom.  The room is complete with impenetrable walls, a ventilation system and phone line of its own, and an array of surveillance monitors showing most of the home's interior.Meg and Sarah settle in, impressed by the panic room but not intending to use it anytime soon. On their first night in their new home, however, a determined trio of robbers breaks in (played by Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto, and Dwight Yoakum), and they won't leave until they get just what they want from the panic room.Directed by David Fincher (""Se7en"", ""Fight Club""), ""Panic Room"" isn't the most brilliant movie you'll ever see, but it's sure to keep you on the edge of your seat.  Although the idea of an entire movie taking place in one house sounds pretty restricted, Fincher still manages to make it a vastly entertaining film.  The majority of the film focuses on Burnham, Junior, and Raoul (the criminals) trying to lure Meg and Sarah out of the room in order to get what they want there, while Meg and Sarah try to get help from outside sources.  This leads to a relentless assault of suspenseful cat-and-mouse scenes upon the viewer, and the various complications along the way make the film even more fun to watch.The musical score, composed by Howard Shore (who would later compose the Oscar-winning music for ""The Fellowship of the Ring""), is suitably suspenseful, and the sound effects also work well to increase the film's tension-particularly those of the omnipresent sledgehammer.  But by far, the film's most distinguishing feature is the dazzling camera work.  The camera is almost always moving and often swoops around the house for a bird's-eye view.  This includes zooming into ventilation shafts, downward through the floors, and even straight into a keyhole.  The use of lighting is also effective, as virtually the entire film takes place in the home with a ""dark and stormy night"" setting, so most of the lighting is created with fluorescent lamps.  And, with the addition of a *very* attractive opening title sequence, ""Panic Room"" is surely a visually triumphant film from beginning to end.The acting is also fairly good, especially considering how cheesy most other films of this genre are.  Forest Whitaker delivers an especially moving performance as the one criminal whom the audience actually learns to like by the film's end.One of the film's weaknesses, however, lies in the smart but occasionally rough script.  While the criminals are realistic and appropriately unlikeable, their dialogue suffers from a few really corny lines.  Comic relief is understandable in a suspense/thriller like this, but one rather inane scene involves Junior repeatedly slamming a mirrored door while yelling about twenty expletives in a row, which leads Raoul to say, ""That's seven years bad luck.""What's more significant, however, is the considerable lack of credibility that develops in the last third of the film.  One scene involving an encounter with the cops is rather silly, and doesn't help to explain a later scene when the cops return to the home.  Also, one character seems to have somehow developed bones of steel near the end, as he/she is able to survive a tremendous blow to the head, and then still manage to avoid getting shot several times and then wrestle another character to the ground.  Finally, a third character's fate is not fully explained, as that character is not present in the film's final scene.Overall, however, ""Panic Room"" is a very fun film to watch, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants good, solid entertainment that won't exactly expand your mind, but also doesn't insult your intelligence like most action films do.

701207,A3EYQU2KQAPPYW,B00006684S,Matt Denison,"[4, 5]","Panic RoomJodie Foster has come a long way since starring in those Disney films ""Candleshoe"" and ""Freaky Friday"". Having been nominated for four Academy Awards (1977 for ""Taxi Driver"", 1989 for ""The Accused"", 1992 for ""The Silence of The Lambs"" and 1995 for ""Nell"") and winning twice (""The Silence of The Lambs"" and ""The Accused"") she is a versatile actor who has shown that she can hold her own against the best of them. Since her last nomination she has decided to take time and make a movie every other year. This is her first movie since 1999's ""Anna and The King"" which failed to ignite at the box office. ""Panic Room"", directed by David Fincher (""Alien 3"", ""Se7en"", ""Fight Club"") is a look at what happens when your first night in new surroundings becomes a chilling battle for survival. Meg Altman (Foster) is a single mother with a daughter (Newcomer Kristen Stewart) who has just finalized a divorce from a pharmaceutical big shot. Now she and her daughter are looking to find a place to live. They settle on a quaint New York brownstone with three floors. The place is everything they need and more. There is something else that it has that puzzles Meg. You see the original owner was paranoid and never thought you could be too safe so he had a secret room put in the apartment. That room is known as a ""Panic Room"" and features virtually everything that you would need should you ever find yourself confined to that room. As Meg and her daughter settle in for the night, they have no idea that three murderous thieves (Forrest Whittaker, Dwight Yoakam, Jared Leto) are intent on getting into the house and obtaining a cache of money hidden in the house. Fleeing to the Panic Room mom and daughter try to get the thieves to leave but they are not easily persuaded and when they reveal that what they want is located in the ""Panic Room"", they realize that they are in for a long night unless they can figure out a way to outwit the thieves who are trying to get in. One of them it is later revealed helped create the room so he tells the other's that since we can't get in we have to get her to come out. How they attempt to do so is quite suspenseful. Country Music singer Dwight Yoakam is chilling as one of the three villains. He spends the first half of the movie covered up by a mask and speaking very little. However halfway through he gets really nasty and shows his true colours. The movie has a lot of nifty camera angles that give you a spooky tour of the place. Every inch of this place looks creepy at night and during some key scenes it makes the movie all the more frightening. I also liked the whole cat and mouse aspect of the film. The thieves can't get in and mother and daughter can't get out. At one point in the story the heroine finds herself faced with a life or death situation involving her daughter. Does she risk their lives to get what is needed or does she stay in the room and hope for some help?

701208,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00006684S,Matthew Horner,"[0, 0]","My opinion of ""Panic Room"" was adversely affected by my high expectations of it. It was directed by David Fincher, the man behind two of my favorite movies - ""Seven"" and ""Fight Club"". It stars Jodie Foster, who was so incredibly good as Agent Starling in one of the great thrillers, ""Silence of the Lambs"". The co-stars are three of my favorite actors - Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto and Dwight Yoakum. In the hands of a lesser [or lesser known] director and crew, this might have seemed like a first-rate thriller. For Fincher and company, though, this strikes me as a second-tier work.Meg Altman [Foster], recently divorced from a very wealthy man, buys a posh townhouse in an exclusive Manhattan neighborhood. The eccentric previous owner had a 'panic room' installed off the master bedroom. Encased by concrete and steel, the room is impervious to intruders. Altman and her young daughter think of the unusual room as nothing more than a conversation piece. They think again when the house is broken into by three men on the very night they move in. They escape into the panic room just in time, only to find that what the men want is in the room itself. The ensuing cat and mouse game resembles a game of chess played by very determined adversaries.The movie is technically brilliant - so much so that I found myself more interested in the set design and the camera work than in the story itself. That's because the script didn't work for me. I know thrillers rarely have a great deal of logic to them, but this one seemed especially absurd. For example, when one of the thieves takes a sledgehammer to the ceiling below the panic room, I wondered why a neighbor didn't call the cops. This is a townhouse in a quiet part of New York, after all, not some isolated mansion.

Unlike &quot;Se7en and &quot;Fight Club,&quot; however, the plot and characters in &quot;Panic Room&quot; can't survive without the subtext, and what we're left with is a slick but unfulfilling little thriller.Freud would've loved the plot - frightened woman and her frail but tough daughter are trapped in the womb of a house while three would-be robbers (who might as well be named Id, Ego, and Superego) invade the home, seeking the treasure that's secure in the center of the fortress. Wow! Anyway, Fincher has fun with camera moves, funky angles, set pieces, and wonderfully muted colors...unfortunately, every self-conscious shot only magnifies his weakness with character development and true, human fear. Examine the moment when Jodie Foster's character discovers the trio in her house - why is it so muted, when it should be filling her - and us - with terror?Unfortunately, I suspect Fincher was drawn to &quot;Panic Room&quot; as much for its flimsy plot (more of a situation, actually) as its symbolism - the simpler the setup, the more chances to dazzle with nifty camerawork. &quot;Panic Room&quot; could've been a nail-biter, but it's only a mildly satisfying thriller, and a waste of most of the actors' talents.",3,Panic?,1078531200,"03 6, 2004",2004,1471,"['movies', 'satirical', 'quot', 'Fight', 'Club', 'quot', 'deep', 'human', 'horror', 'quot', 'Se7en', 'quot', ""could've-been"", 'quot', 'Alien', '3', 'quot', 'Fincher', 'quot', 'Panic', 'Room', 'quot', 'conventional', 'thriller', 'loaded', 'layer', 'subtext', 'Unlike', 'quot', 'Se7en', 'quot', 'Fight', 'Club', 'quot', 'however', 'plot', 'characters', 'quot', 'Panic', 'Room', 'quot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'survive', 'subtext', 'what', ""'re"", 'left', 'slick', 'unfulfilling', 'little', 'thriller.Freud', 'would', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'plot', 'frightened', 'woman', 'frail', 'tough', 'daughter', 'are', 'trapped', 'womb', 'house', 'three', 'would-be', 'robbers', 'who', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'named', 'Id', 'Ego', 'Superego', 'invade', 'home', 'seeking', 'treasure', 'secure', 'center', 'fortress', 'Wow', 'Anyway', 'Fincher', 'fun', 'camera', 'moves', 'funky', 'angles', 'set', 'pieces', 'wonderfully', 'muted', 'colors', 'unfortunately', 'self-conscious', 'shot', 'only', 'weakness', 'character', 'development', 'true', 'human', 'fear', 'Examine', 'moment', 'when', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'character', 'trio', 'house', 'why', 'so', 'muted', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'filling', 'terror', 'Unfortunately', 'suspect', 'Fincher', 'was', 'drawn', 'quot', 'Panic', 'Room', 'quot', 'much', 'flimsy', 'plot', 'more', 'situation', 'actually', 'symbolism', 'simpler', 'setup', 'more', 'chances', 'dazzle', 'nifty', 'camerawork', 'quot', 'Panic', 'Room', 'quot', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nail-biter', 'only', 'mildly', 'satisfying', 'thriller', 'waste', 'most', 'actors', 'talents']",N/A

From the very beginning of the movie, to the very end, my nails were digging into my palms, and I was constantly wondering what would happen next. Despite having your usual plotholes (propane being lighter than air for example) and some of the characters being so utterly stupid, it beggars belief, this doesn't detract from the movie at all. The film, being largely set in the one place, also makes you feel extremely claustrophobic.The opening credits are the most original next to Cellular in my opinion. Opening credits are amazingly realistic in that they cast shadows and are reflected on the surrounding glass buildings. This was the first of two films in as many months to feature screenwriter David Koepp's name in the opening credits, hanging in front of a New York skyscraper. (See also Spider-Man) The opening credits were created by a collaboration between title design company The Picture Mill and special effects company ComputerCafe. It took them one year to complete.Jodie Foster played an absolutely amazing character in this. For some reason, I've never been too keen on watching Jodie Foster, and have only seen her in Silence Of The Lambs, and the original Freaky Friday. She was pregnant with her second child during filming. Because of this, reshoots had to be made in the autumn of 2001 after she had given birth, as principal photography took longer than planned. According to David Fincher, Kristen Stewart grew more than three inches during filming of this project. She was smaller than Jodie when the production satrted and towered over her when the final shots were done, no doubt due to the reshoots! Nicole Kidman was originally cast to play the role of Meg Altman, but was forced to back out of the role after eighteen days due to a recurring knee injury. She originally injured the knee during the filming of Moulin Rouge! However, you can still hear her as the voice of Stephen Altman's girlfriend.The cellular phone used by Jodie Foster in this movie is a Nokia 8890. The silver slide phone is often mistaken as the phone used in The Matrix.The only thing I didn't like about this movie was Kirsten Stewart's performance. It was very bland for some reason, and I thought she could have easily stabbed the bad guys with insulin long before she did. Both actresses are also quite plain looking, which works for Jodie Foster, but not so much in Kirsten's case, as she's almost instantly forgettable, as well as being a very androgynous actress. Thankfully, she avoids the cutesy kid thing very well, although comes across as a little brat occasionally.The only quibble I have about the ending (apart from Forest Whitaker's character giving up way too easily), is what happened to the dad/husband? Did he die, did he live? I would have liked to have found out what happened to him.I quite liked the bit where the girl, Sarah, used ""SOS"" morse code to attract the attention of a neighbour, and when asked where she learned it from, she said Titanic. This would commonly be taken to mean the multi-Oscar-winning film Titanic.

However, Fincher blesses us with a taut, visually stirring suspense-filled thriller.  Jodie Foster plays a recent divorcee who moves into an elegant brownstone with her daughter, played quite well by Kristen Stewart.  One unique feature of the house is its panic room----a room to go if you're house is invaded.  And lo and behold, does it get invaded!  Seems like the former owner left behind some money in a safe--where else, but in the panic room!!!!The trio of villains, quite reminiscent of those in ""Wait Until Dark"" have their own agenda---henchman Jared Leto (I wanted to cut off his fingers, everytime he used them to punctuate his lines); the security man who installed the panic room (a nice performance from Forest Whitaker); and the obviously demonic Dwight Yoakam, a country singer whose stone-faced evil could be called a rotten performance, but it manages to work because the character is so blatantly heartless.  I, too, had some trouble seeing Jodie's character married to such an older man, and if there is any weakness, it is the lack of any rapport between Foster, Stewart and Patrick Bauchau who plays the unfortunate ex-husband, Steven.  An especially tense, subtly so, sequence is when Foster sends two cops away who have come to answer her husband's phone call.  There is such fierce conflict in Foster's attempts to get rid of them so the two remaining villains won't ice her daughter.In another vein, I really admired the opening credits, the way the names appeared to be signs on some of the buildings.

Together with her daughter (Kristen Stewart), Meg moves into a luxurious four-floor Manhattan home that is equipped with a ""panic room"": a fortified, high-tech bunker for use in case of a home invasion. Of course, right after mother and daughter move in, such a home invasion occurs. This leads to a gripping chess-like contest between homeowner and criminals, and is ultimately resolved in an electrifying conclusion.""Panic Room"" is a lean, gripping thriller that is full of intriguing plot turns and inventive gambits (by both heroes and villains). There are solid performances by the entire cast, which includes Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto (in an appalling hairdo), and Dwight Yoakam. Ian Buchanan is especially fun in his brief role as an imperious, but oh-so-charming real estate agent (a performance prominently featured in the film's memorable trailer).Overall, I really enjoyed ""Panic Room."" But I couldn't help feeling that the film has a creepy classist and sexist flavor. I find it hard to really summon up sympathy for a super-rich woman who can afford such a uber-luxurious crib when my hard working public school teacher sister lived for years in a Manhattan efficiency! Is the subtle message here that we as a society need to work harder to protect the property of the priveleged and wealthy? And there seems to be a further subtle anti-feminist message: that if Foster's character had worked harder to please her super-rich ex-husband, he wouldn't have dumped her for another woman, and thus she wouldn't have needed the new digs and wouldn't have gotten into this mess at all.Oh well; perhaps I overanalyze.

Jurassic Park III is a perfect example of this.  It's like the screenwriters said, ""Hey, lets throw all these characters on an island filled with dinosaurs for about an hour and a half and watch them struggle to survive, and then lets get them out so we can do another sequel.""  Good character development is thrown out the window because they just want plot.Panic Room is much the same way.  The story is very simple.  A mother and daughter buy a new house because Daddy decided to get a new woman.  The realtor shows them the house, familirizing the viewer with the layout, gives a brief history of the panic room, which is designed to protect the house's residents in case of a burglary by encasing them in an impenetrable room. The house is on the market because a rich man had just died.The mother and daughter buy it, and the first night there three burglars enter the house to get money in the panic room.  The women get into the room.  The rest of the film is much like a chess game, with the rules clearly established.  Who wins depends on who has the best strategy.Panic Room shares the same flaw of Jurassic Park III.  While Panic Room does much better than Jurassic Park III, it still feels just like an excuse to see these characters thrown into a thriller where they have to survive.  The characters are not established as real people you really want to get to know but just a vehicle for the plot.Overall, Panic Room lacks those qualities that made Hitchcock's films so memorable.  In Hitchcock, his characters never feel like just an tool to move a plot.  The plots themselves are ingeniously drawn, and the endings both shock and tantalize the viewer by tying up the plot into a neat package.  Best of all, his characters are both convincing and legitimate.The best asset of Panic Room is Forest Whitaker, the most sympathetically drawn character in the entire movie.  He is the only one that feels like a real person instead of just one more plot device.  Had they done the other characters like his character, they would have both the suspense and the right character development to make a truly effective thriller.As it stands, Panic Room is a film that once you see it, there's nothing to go back too.  You can always go back to a Hitchcock film.April 18, 2002-Written as Newspaper review in 2002 while the movie was in theatres (released on Amazon.co.uk in 2007).

And you can't, cause he's not the problem here. In fact, he deserves kudos for taking up a film with so many obstacles: namely, a single location, a small number of characters, and a restricted period of time in which the story takes place. But all these challenges are ones that should've been overcome at the scripting stage. Fincher isn't fighting an up-hill battle. He's trudging through the remains of a dead script.Fincher's strength - his dark and innovative visual style - gets completely overtaken by the boring, simple, unmotivated screenplay by Koepp that has several crippling weaknesses:1) laughable dialogue with too much reliance on expletives and hokey name-calling2) ineffective build-up of tension due to drawn-out, somewhat ridiculous plot devices3) inability to believe Foster and her daughter are in any real danger because of the presence of Whitaker's character4) a non-engaging cat-and-mouse game because too little is happening - people are just waiting for their opponents' next move5) minimal character development that offers no surprisesThat last weakness is the Achilles heel of ""Panic Room."" In Fincher's previous films, the twists and surprises come not in plot, but in character. ""Fight Club"" and ""Se7en"" pay off at the end because of what is revealed about Tyler and John Doe. In ""Panic Room,"" not only are the characters one-dimensional, they're also extraneous. Junior serves no practical purpose in the story - he could've simply stepped in at the middle (to bring out Raoul's wild side) and stepped out. Raoul himself doesn't do much up until that point. And Foster's daughter has no effect on the events whatsoever. She would've served the same purpose (namely, as the object of Foster's maternal instinct) if she were comatose or an infant baby.But bland characters do not doom a film. It can still be enjoyable if there's a a nice plot twist or two. Alas, there's not even a cheap surprise in store for you at the end of ""Panic Room."" And that's a shame because the premise sets up an intriguing question: what's in the panic room that these thieves are so anxious to get? Early in the film, Leto states to Whitaker (and the audience) what's supposed to be there. And guess what. The very thing they expect is exactly what they find.

701225,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,B00006684S,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[0, 0]","It's finally here, the age where movies are hyped not just for the next pretty star that's in them but for the next serious actor that's in them and for the director's reputation.  In a similar vein to Insomnia, Punch Drunk Love and About Schmidt, the hype surrounding Panic Room surrounded not only its premise but also the question as to whether it would live up to the expectations produced by Fight Club?  The answer is a kind of, which certainly isn't to say that Panic Room isn't a highly efficient, taut genre piece.  It is.  The premise is pretty basic, having Meg (Foster) and Sarah move into a new house after Meg's painful divorce with her husband.  The house contains a so-called 'panic room' where occupants can hide should burglars break into the house, a room that's inpenetrable and completely safe.  Of course, burglars do break in looking for $6 million that is hidden in...you guessed it, the panic room.It's not really in the premise of the film that you expect Fincher to pull all this off but in the psychological struggle between mother/daughter and robbers.  Given this it's perhaps a pity that the two groups are allowed little interaction bar a few 'get out of my house'-type comments.  In fact, Fincher doesn't veer from the formula much at all.  The obligatory efforts to contact the outside world are all present and intact, although it's a shame that later plot devices are so clearly pinpointed to the audience beforehand that they're not anywhere near as surprising as they could have been.  Take for instance the long take of Meg placing her mobile phone on the charger by her bed, or the explanation of the house's unique elevator system.  The heavyhandedness of this ensures that little suspense is generated when Meg finally realises she has a cell phone about half an hour after the audience does so.  That said, this is a distinctly Fincher picture, something that is nowhere as evident as in the camera work.  Remember the title credits of Fight Club where the camera zoomed outwards from the inside of the brain?  Here the camera zooms across surfaces, through keyholes and up stairwells so effortlessly that there's a real sense of voyeurism built up, and such a nod to classic thriller Rear Window is certainly appreciated.  It's Hitchcock that Fincher truly evokes here, pumping life into a very familiar formula, making a genre film exciting without really moving out of the boundaries of it.  In many ways a comparison can be made to Chrisopher Nolan's Insomnia, which disappointed many as it wasn't as unconventional or groundbreaking as his previous work Memento had been.  Here Panic Room is the lesser partner, but the fact that it isn't as original as Fight Club can't really be said to be a necessarily bad thing.  Of course there are many flaws here but Fincher's style is just so effortless that you should be able to sit back and enjoy the show rather than worrying that this isn't as thought-provoking as you might like it to be.As for the acting, Jodie Foster again proves what a resourceful actress she is within tight limits, and the girl who plays Sarah is very good indeed considering she's playing a highly stereotyped role of angsty teenage girl.  Jared Leto, playing a completely different role yet again (compare his character here with the ones he played in Fight Club and Requiem For A Dream), shows off his amazing talent in an unsympathetic role compared to Forrest Whittaker's wisely restrained performance as the burglar with a conscience.  Also watch out for a cameo from Nicole Kidman, who was originally cast to play the lead but had to drop out due to a leg injury sustained whilst filming Moulin Rouge, as Meg's ex-husband's new girlfriend on the telephone.All in all Panic Room is one of the best movies of last year and although it may not deserve any Oscars for originality, it's an intelligently written and nicely character-driven film that despite lack of tension in some areas does manage to develop some suspense when things are up and running.  Never going for the easy option it should be similarly noted that apart from the prologue and epilogue, the camera never leaves the house, leading to an intense claustrophobia that only heightens our panic for the central characters.",4,Highly efficient thriller,1045612800,"02 19, 2003",2003,4262,"['finally', 'here', 'age', 'where', 'movies', 'are', 'hyped', 'not', 'just', 'next', 'pretty', 'star', 'next', 'serious', 'actor', 'director', 'reputation', 'similar', 'vein', 'Insomnia', 'Punch', 'Drunk', 'Love', 'About', 'Schmidt', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'Panic', 'Room', 'surrounded', 'not', 'only', 'premise', 'also', 'question', 'would', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'produced', 'Fight', 'Club', 'answer', 'kind', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'say', 'Panic', 'Room', ""n't"", 'highly', 'efficient', 'taut', 'genre', 'piece', 'premise', 'pretty', 'basic', 'having', 'Meg', 'Foster', 'Sarah', 'move', 'new', 'house', 'Meg', 'painful', 'divorce', 'husband', 'house', 'so-called', ""'panic"", 'room', 'where', 'occupants', 'can', 'hide', 'should', 'burglars', 'break', 'house', 'room', 'inpenetrable', 'completely', 'safe', 'course', 'burglars', 'do', 'break', 'looking', '6', 'million', 'hidden', 'guessed', 'panic', 'room.It', 'not', 'really', 'premise', 'film', 'expect', 'Fincher', 'pull', 'off', 'psychological', 'struggle', 'mother/daughter', 'robbers', 'Given', 'perhaps', 'pity', 'two', 'groups', 'are', 'allowed', 'little', 'interaction', 'bar', 'few', ""house'-type"", 'comments', 'fact', 'Fincher', ""n't"", 'veer', 'formula', 'much', 'obligatory', 'efforts', 'contact', 'outside', 'world', 'are', 'present', 'intact', 'shame', 'later', 'plot', 'devices', 'are', 'so', 'clearly', 'pinpointed', 'audience', 'beforehand', ""'re"", 'not', 'anywhere', 'as', 'surprising', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Take', 'instance', 'long', 'take', 'Meg', 'placing', 'mobile', 'phone', 'charger', 'bed', 'explanation', 'house', 'unique', 'elevator', 'system', 'heavyhandedness', 'little', 'suspense', 'generated', 'when', 'Meg', 'finally', 'cell', 'phone', 'hour', 'audience', 'so', 'said', 'distinctly', 'Fincher', 'picture', 'something', 'nowhere', 'as', 'evident', 'camera', 'work', 'Remember', 'title', 'credits', 'Fight', 'Club', 'where', 'camera', 'zoomed', 'outwards', 'inside', 'brain', 'Here', 'camera', 'surfaces', 'keyholes', 'up', 'stairwells', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'real', 'sense', 'voyeurism', 'built', 'up', 'nod', 'classic', 'thriller', 'Rear', 'Window', 'certainly', 'appreciated', 'Hitchcock', 'Fincher', 'truly', 'here', 'pumping', 'life', 'very', 'familiar', 'formula', 'making', 'genre', 'film', 'exciting', 'really', 'moving', 'boundaries', 'many', 'ways', 'comparison', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'Chrisopher', 'Nolan', 'Insomnia', 'disappointed', 'many', 'was', ""n't"", 'unconventional', 'groundbreaking', 'previous', 'work', 'Memento', 'had', 'been', 'Here', 'Panic', 'Room', 'lesser', 'partner', 'fact', ""n't"", 'as', 'original', 'Fight', 'Club', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'be', 'said', 'be', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'course', 'are', 'many', 'flaws', 'here', 'Fincher', 'style', 'just', 'so', 'effortless', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'show', 'rather', 'worrying', ""n't"", 'as', 'thought-provoking', 'might', 'like', 'be.As', 'acting', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'again', 'what', 'resourceful', 'actress', 'tight', 'limits', 'girl', 'who', 'Sarah', 'very', 'good', 'indeed', 'considering', 'playing', 'highly', 'stereotyped', 'role', 'angsty', 'teenage', 'girl', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'playing', 'completely', 'different', 'role', 'yet', 'again', 'compare', 'character', 'here', 'ones', 'played', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Requiem', 'A', 'Dream', 'amazing', 'talent', 'unsympathetic', 'role', 'compared', 'Forrest', 'Whittaker', 'wisely', 'restrained', 'performance', 'burglar', 'conscience', 'Also', 'watch', 'out', 'cameo', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'who', 'was', 'originally', 'cast', 'play', 'lead', 'had', 'drop', 'out', 'due', 'leg', 'injury', 'sustained', 'whilst', 'filming', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'Meg', 'ex-husband', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'telephone.All', 'Panic', 'Room', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'last', 'year', 'may', 'not', 'deserve', 'Oscars', 'originality', 'intelligently', 'written', 'nicely', 'character-driven', 'film', 'lack', 'tension', 'areas', 'manage', 'develop', 'suspense', 'when', 'things', 'are', 'up', 'running', 'Never', 'going', 'easy', 'option', 'should', 'be', 'similarly', 'noted', 'apart', 'prologue', 'epilogue', 'camera', 'never', 'house', 'leading', 'intense', 'claustrophobia', 'only', 'panic', 'central', 'characters']",N/A

The place we go at the end of a hard day to relax, to sleep, somewhere safe and warm but at the back of our minds is always the fear of this sanctuary being compromised and our peaceful existence being shattered.This is the backdrop for David Fincher&#65533;s latest dark and claustrophobic movie thriller &#65533;Panic Room&#65533;, where single mother (Jodie Foster), recently estranged from her very rich husband, moves into a dark but rather opulent five-storey brownstone on West 94th Street on the upper west side of Manhattan, with her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart). Apart from (surely) being too big for only two people to live in, the house comes complete with its own elevator, CCTV and an impenetrable panic room; somewhere safe to hide should the house ever be invaded. And of course inevitably on their first night in their new house that&#65533;s exactly what happens and mother and daughter have to seek sanctuary in the aforementioned rather claustrophobic room. But here&#65533;s the rub, what the robbers (Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto, Dwight Yoakam) want is in the panic room and the emergency insulin shot that the daughter Sarah urgently needs is outside the panic room, and so begins a battle of wits, with Meg and Sarah&#65533;s desperate attempts to attract help, whilst the criminals (in between squabbles) come up with plan after plan to drive them from their seemingly impenetrable sanctuary. As Sarah's diabetes starts to send her into a hypo-glycaemic shock, Director Fincher (Alien 3, Seven, The Game, Fight Club) expertly cranks the feelings of danger urgency and claustrophobia up notch by notch.Although it would be fair to say that the cast of conventional characters are more than familiar; the gutsy mother and her rebellious daughter, the kindly first-time criminal (Forest Whitaker), the big-mothed idiot (Jared Leto) and the vicious psychopath (Dwight Yoakam), it must also be said that all the actors concerned bring depth, subtlety and believability to their performances, lifting their characters above and beyond stereotype. However, it is David Fincher&#65533;s innovation backed up by his cinematographers, Conrad W Hall and Darius Khondji, which lift this movie above the average and ordinary, as in (what appear to be) unbroken shots, the camera swoops from room to room, down stairwells, up to skylights, along air ducts and through walls. All in all Panic Room is probably Director Fincher&#65533;s most conventional film to date and certainly not as ground-breaking as Fight Club or Se7en or as clever as The Game but it is still a very enjoyable thriller, which bears many of his very dark and edgy hallmarks.

So there it is in the middle with nothing really to make it stand out from the crowded genre of suspense thrillers.  After director David Fincher has delivered such unique twisted tales shot in a highly stylized manner such as ""Seven"" and ""The Game"", we expect a little more out of ""Panic Room.""  But what really stands out from this movie is not so much the acting, plot, or mood, but instead a cool special effect in which the camera moves the viewer from room to room and gives you this quick glance at the space in between walls.  It's a grabbing omnipotent filming technique that gives you a sense of the house as a character.  But the fact that the movie highlight was a special effect is a telling hint at the overall impression of the movie itself.For the most part the acting is good.  We get quality Foster as she seems to have a strength for this type ""strong woman in a tense situation"" roles.

Also, like The Hand that Rocks the Cradle, Panic Room's promise disappears within minutes and the film turns into a mindless mess. Jodie Foster who's known for masculine, tougher, butch-like roles plays a single mother who's normal boring world goes from ordinary to thrilling in one night. I thought this would be different but once again Hollywood pees on its own leg. We get a bratty, foul-mouthed child ( whose mother allows her to curse right in front of her ), a disillusioned mother and a couple of criminals in the dullest looking house to ever be in a film. The setting is dark and gloomy making the film as boring as watching a corpse rot.  Don't be fooled. The title is wonderful but nothing hooks you in. This is nothing different from a million other films where a woman was trapped in a house with criminals. It's been done for centuries and this is the worst version of anything similar.The supporting actors Jared Leto and Forrest Whitaker out-acted Foster easily though I felt Forrest was wasted. Bottom line, this movie isn't even interesting enough to review. I just felt I should save someone the time and trouble of seeing this crap. It's one of the most boring, draggy films you'll ever experience. It's like being in a time capsule for fifty years. NOTHING seems to ever move and by the time it does...you'll be asleep or have stopped watching. Why BUY this when it's on Cinemax every day and night? Save your money and watch it on cable.

That does not happen often, particularly for a film that I was late seeing and about which I therefore had tons of preconceived notions. I was pleased with how well they established the basic premise of the film at the beginning, something that had seemed silly in the trailers was perfectly credible in the actual film. The $95 Million U.S. box office must have happened from word-of-mouth because the trailer simply does not do the film justice.There were only minor plot holes, although the lame way that Meg and her daughter initially get into the panic room almost derails the whole thing. And I still find it inconceivable that $48 Million had to be spent on what is really a very small film. Since so little of the budget ever makes it onto the screen they would have been better served with the creative incentive of a smaller budget.Nicole Kidman was originally cast to play Meg but hurt her knee and had to drop out. I don't think they lost anything by bringing in Jodie Foster, I can't imagine Kidman doing any better, Meg's kind of brainy stubborn scrapper is Foster's specialty. And she is much better from a physical casting perspective, as Kristen Stewart looks like she could actually be Foster's daughter. In fact, there were more that a few times when I momentarily got the two of them confused. This was very appropriate because ""Panic Room's"" heroines are not the usual film-fare mother and daughter (one strong and one weak), but rather a ""like mother-like daughter"" situation. I think Stewart has a great future in films (see ""Speak"" for a example of her ability to carry a whole feature) and it was nice that she got a chance so early in her career to work closely with Foster.I was particularly impressed with the pacing of this story and its similarity to chess masters hiding one line of attack inside another. The battle progresses much like a chess match, as pieces are lost the layout becomes less familiar and the alternatives fewer. As the two sides use up resources and get sucked in deeper, their earlier choices limit the choices that are available to them. This chess-like process holds until the very end of the film.Then again, what do I know?

701245,A319YRDK8Y39N,B00006684S,"""qmlhcb""","[2, 4]","Panic Room takes the classic technique of having a limited set (almost the entire film taking place in a house, and most of that in a single room), and adds a visual style to make it exciting.Some reviewers have criticized many of the &quot;excessive&quot; shots as the &quot;camera&quot; zooms through floors and ceilings to follow action as thieves break into the house owned by a woman (Jodie Foster) and her daughter. But when you have a film that takes place in a confined setting, the visual tone of the film is often lifeless. Director David Fincher used the &quot;camera&quot; to capture impossible scenes of roaming through walls to help visually tell the story. And isn't that what the film media is supposed to do? Tell stories primarily through visual images?But the visual style, while perhaps the most prominent, is by far not the heart of this film.

I guess there is just something about the name that sparks interest.  Don't fall for this.  I am taking this opportunity to lower your expectations of this movie in hopes that if and when you see this movie, you may be able to salvage your viewing experience.Panic Room begins with a mother (Jodie Foster) and her daughter hunting for a new apartment as the product of a recent divorce.  They are reeled into buying the townhouse that becomes the center of the movies' attention.  Along with an extensive security system, this house also comes equiped with it's very own ""panic room""...a highly sucure room used in cases of emergency.  To make a long story short, some burglars break into the house and try to steal a load of money that happens to be hidden in the ""panic room"".  The mother hears the ""HomeAlone-esque"" criminals bumbling around in the house, grabs her daughter and hides out in the ""panic room"".The rest of the movie is comprised of the burglars attempting to break into the ""panic room"" and Jodie Foster failing to convincingly play the part of a concerned mother in a desperate situation.All in all, stay clear of this movie unless you are deathly bored or have seen all the other better movies that are out.To sum up:Fun level: 3 of 5 starsActing: 2 of 5 starsRomance: 0 of 5 starsPlot: 1 of 5 starsAction: 2 of 5 stars",2,Mediocre plot...less than convincing acting.,1032998400,"09 26, 2002",2002,1454,"['must', 'admit', 'when', 'girlfriend', 'told', 'new', 'movie', 'Panic', 'Room', 'was', 'fairly', 'excited', 'seeing', 'guess', 'just', 'something', 'name', 'interest', 'Do', ""n't"", 'fall', 'am', 'taking', 'opportunity', 'lower', 'expectations', 'movie', 'hopes', 'when', 'see', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'salvage', 'viewing', 'experience.Panic', 'Room', 'mother', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'daughter', 'hunting', 'new', 'apartment', 'product', 'recent', 'divorce', 'are', 'reeled', 'buying', 'townhouse', 'center', 'movies', 'attention', 'extensive', 'security', 'system', 'house', 'also', 'equiped', 'very', 'own', 'panic', 'room', 'highly', 'sucure', 'room', 'used', 'cases', 'emergency', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'burglars', 'break', 'house', 'try', 'steal', 'load', 'money', 'be', 'hidden', 'panic', 'room', 'mother', 'HomeAlone-esque', 'criminals', 'bumbling', 'around', 'house', 'grabs', 'daughter', 'out', 'panic', 'room', '.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'comprised', 'burglars', 'attempting', 'break', 'panic', 'room', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'failing', 'convincingly', 'play', 'part', 'concerned', 'mother', 'desperate', 'situation.All', 'stay', 'clear', 'movie', 'are', 'deathly', 'bored', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'better', 'movies', 'are', 'out.To', 'sum', 'up', 'Fun', 'level', '3', '5', 'starsActing', '2', '5', 'starsRomance', '0', '5', 'starsPlot', '1', '5', 'starsAction', '2', '5', 'stars']",N/A

To fully appreciate this excellent film, one must drop all expectations and presumptions at the door.Now, ""Panic Room"" is no-doubt a thriller, but it has an unusual dosage of humor and unlikely castings.  Forest Whitaker's soft heart, Jared Leto's comical stupidity, and Dwight Yoakam's impulsive rage are indeed an odd combination for such a film.  Add in the the fact that this is not your typical cat-and-mouse game between a cop and a criminal, and ""Panic Room"" is truely one of the freshest productions to come along in a good while!  Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart handle their roles to a tee, but it is the villians who are the gleaming highlight.  The characters played by Leto and Whitaker both have weaknesses that make them seem almost harmless, allowing for respite from the dramatic action.  By the middle of the film, you'll realize both of them are far from the bonafide, heartless killers you may have intially thought them to be.  Nonetheless, Yoakam makes sure the viewer gets his/her share of shakes and jolts as his homocidal character progressively gets more and more out of control throughout the film.  ""Raoul"" starts off as if he's just a quiet assistant to Leto and Whitaker, but he soon takes control of the scrape with his quick instincts and cold-blooded decisions.Overall, ""Panic Room"" doesn't contain the all-out viciousness, nor the head-scratching mystery that most thrillers live and die by.  In place of this is a creative plot and some very interesting character interaction.  The script is sharp, not wasting any time on narritives or character backgrounds. Finchner's fast-moving camera work is the icing on the cake that makes this a fine thriller.

701250,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00006684S,Reviewer,"[3, 5]","Everyone likes to think that they'd know what they would do-- without hesitation, yet-- if suddenly and unexpectedly confronted with a perilous, even life-threatening, situation.  It's human nature; we all want to feel, or at least believe, that we are always in control of everything that happens in our lives.  But, upon reflection, if that IS, in fact, what you think, then you're probably not being entirely honest with yourself.  Because unless you're Dirty Harry, or someone of that ilk (and take note, the key word here is ""are,"" not ""think"" you are), you're not really going to know how you'd react to any such situation until the moment of truth is actually upon you.  And it's that moment that director David Fincher enables you to experience, albeit vicariously, in ""Panic Room,"" a suspense/thriller that very quickly takes you to a very dark place-- a place few have actually ever been or would care to go, if given the choice.  But, of course, when it comes to a situation like the one depicted in this film, that's the rub:  You simply do not get to choose whether or not you want to participate.  And when you really think about it, it's a concept that is more than a bit disconcerting, to say the least.  Because whether or not you want it, if it happens, you are going to be confronted with that moment of truth; and in that moment, you will probably learn more about yourself than you've ever known before.As the film begins, recently divorced New Yorker Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) is being shown a property, a spacious Brownstone Townhouse, which she ultimately decides upon and secures for herself and her teenage daughter, Sarah (Kristen Stewart).  They move in, and prepare for their first night in the new house.  What Meg cannot know, however, is that someone else has an eye on her house, but it has nothing to do with wanting to live there.  His name is Junior (Jared Leto), whom, as it happens, knew the previous tenant-- a wealthy, and apparently paranoid recluse-- more than just a bit.  He also knows (or at least thinks he does) that there is something extremely valuable hidden in that house.  And now that the previous owner has passed on, Junior wants it.Toward that end, he recruits a couple of acquaintances, Burnham and Raoul (Forest Whitaker and Dwight Yoakam) to help him get it.  But as fate would have it, Junior makes his move on the very night that Meg and Sarah move into the house, which as far as Junior knows, is still vacant.  They break in successfully, but it all goes south quickly when they discover the house is occupied, a situation for which Junior and his gang have no contingency plans; and their hesitation enables Meg and Sarah to make it to a safe room-- the ""Panic Room"" of the title-- a virtually impregnable room built by the previous owner as a safeguard against intruders.  And with the aid of a closed-circuit video surveillance/security system, Meg is able to monitor the movements of the trespassers throughout the house from inside her fortress, and she has no intention of emerging until they are gone.  But Junior is adamant; and he's not about to leave until he has what he came for.  And at that point, the standoff begins.In his previous films (especially ""Se7en"") Fincher has established his use of a dark, brooding atmosphere-- pregnant with foreboding-- to enhance the suspense and drama of his story, and this film is no exception.  Night falls, and Fincher uses the oncoming darkness and the stillness of the house to create a sense of isolation that is the subtle beginning of the tension he will continue to build and maintain throughout the film.  He also uses some imaginative camera work, slowly exploring the house from the audience's point-of-view, which-- combined with Meg's initial apparent trepidation upon entering the panic room itself-- gives it all a pointedly claustrophobic feeling.  Those with difficulties in that regard, in fact, may experience some uneasiness during a good portion of this film because of it; and it simply demonstrates what a good job Fincher did in creating the setting he wanted, and which he uses so effectively here to keep you on the edge of your seat.The plot is fairly basic, with an inherently narrow framework within which Fincher must work; but he sets a perfect pace and has an inventive touch both visually and psychologically that enables him to take an average screenplay (by David Koepp) to a higher level in the finished product.  Considering the storyline, some of what happens is-- some would say predictable-- though I prefer to call it inevitable (granted, a thin line differentiates the two; in this case, however, I feel ""inevitable"" is more accurate), and there are some surprises, which Fincher uses to great advantage.It's no surprise, however, that what really elevates this film is the totally convincing performance by Jodie Foster as Meg.  Long one of the best actors around, she has the talent and ability to turn any material she's given into so much more than any writer or director could possibly hope to expect.  What makes her so remarkable-- as she is in this film-- is not only the fact that she can create such a believable character, but that she can do it with such intelligence and resourcefulness.  You have but to look into Foster's eyes to realize how much is going on constantly behind them; this is one savvy lady whom you can readily believe is always one step ahead of everyone else in the room.  And she goes a long way in proving that true beauty is, indeed, more than skin deep; she's attractive to begin with, but in a pair of black, horn-rimmed glasses, she looks ravishing.  In the final analysis, ""Panic Room"" is Foster's film; and she makes it a satisfying cinematic experience for her audience.",4,Remarkable Performance by Jodie Foster,1017792000,"04 3,

The entire premise was revealed in the first 10 minutes, if you paid attention, and I was thinking that this was going to be a formula bore-fest with predictable goings-on and stock good guys & bad guys. I was right about the premise, but in the hands of David Fincher (whom I've admired greatly since ""Alien 3"" and all subsequent endeavors) the standard becomes quite unique. I consider Jodie Foster to be among the finest living actresses, and she comes through like a pro, as usual. There are certain elements in her portrayal that are gripping. She's having a hard time with the realization that she'd been dumped by hubby for a newer version, trying to understand, as well as showing genuine motherly devotion to her seemingly insensitive daughter (a fine, understated performance by Kristin Stewart...who reminded me of a young Ellen de Generes). After about an hour into the film, I realized that NONE of the 5 main characters had any discernable self-confidence, and these weaknesses added substantially to the resulting hour of the film. Though this could be compared to ""Desperate Hours"", ""Cape Fear"" or ""Wait Until Dark"", the characters in ""Panic Room"" were less sure of themselves, allowing the audience to identify to a stronger degree. Indeed, Foster's new-found courage (when daughter gets sick) gives her a strength above the others. Forrest Whittaker is best when he plays a nice guy, as he does here (the stock ""victim of circumtances""); Dwight Yoakam was strong as the true psychotic in the group, and Jered Leto, with his whining rich-kid, poor put-upon creep, made me want to find him and slap him silly. To have that effect on me made me realize that his performance was really fine. Fincher maintained a solid, steady mood; and the camera-work was reminiscent of the best of Hitchcock, though not quite as subtle. But it's Jodie Foster, with sly nuance and mild double-takes that snaps her out of her funk. It's clever, despite the predictibility of it all, and as the only material Hollywood has to deal with lately are re-hashes of old plots, you could do worse than enjoying the Filmmakers' talents involved in ""Panic Room"".",5,It's all there if you pay attention...,1019520000,"04 23, 2002",2002,2178,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'entire', 'premise', 'was', 'revealed', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'paid', 'attention', 'was', 'thinking', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'formula', 'bore-fest', 'predictable', 'goings-on', 'stock', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'was', 'right', 'premise', 'hands', 'David', 'Fincher', 'whom', ""'ve"", 'admired', 'greatly', 'Alien', '3', 'subsequent', 'endeavors', 'standard', 'quite', 'unique', 'consider', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'be', 'finest', 'living', 'actresses', 'pro', 'usual', 'are', 'certain', 'elements', 'portrayal', 'are', 'gripping', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'realization', ""'d"", 'been', 'dumped', 'hubby', 'newer', 'version', 'trying', 'understand', 'as', 'well', 'showing', 'genuine', 'motherly', 'devotion', 'seemingly', 'insensitive', 'daughter', 'fine', 'understated', 'performance', 'Kristin', 'Stewart', 'who', 'reminded', 'young', 'Ellen', 'de', 'Generes', 'hour', 'film', 'realized', 'NONE', '5', 'main', 'characters', 'had', 'discernable', 'self-confidence', 'weaknesses', 'added', 'substantially', 'resulting', 'hour', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'compared', 'Desperate', 'Hours', 'Cape', 'Fear', 'Wait', 'Dark', 'characters', 'Panic', 'Room', 'were', 'less', 'sure', 'allowing', 'audience', 'identify', 'stronger', 'degree', 'Indeed', 'Foster', 'new-found', 'courage', 'when', 'daughter', 'sick', 'strength', 'others', 'Forrest', 'Whittaker', 'best', 'when', 'nice', 'guy', 'here', 'stock', 'victim', 'circumtances', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'was', 'strong', 'true', 'psychotic', 'group', 'Jered', 'Leto', 'whining', 'rich-kid', 'poor', 'put-upon', 'creep', 'made', 'want', 'find', 'slap', 'silly', 'have', 'effect', 'made', 'realize', 'performance', 'was', 'really', 'fine', 'Fincher', 'maintained', 'solid', 'steady', 'mood', 'camera-work', 'was', 'reminiscent', 'best', 'Hitchcock', 'not', 'quite', 'subtle', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'sly', 'nuance', 'mild', 'double-takes', 'out', 'funk', 'clever', 'predictibility', 'only', 'material', 'Hollywood', 'deal', 'lately', 'are', 're-hashes', 'old', 'plots', 'could', 'do', 'worse', 'enjoying', 'Filmmakers', 'talents', 'involved', 'Panic', 'Room']",N/A

701256,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00006684S,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[9, 16]","Panic Room (David Fincher, 2002)I used to think David Fincher was incapable of making a bad movie. Even the last few scenes of Fight Club, as painfully hokey as they were, didn't set me up for a whole two hours of badness. And to be fair, Panic Room isn't all bad. But it's A DAVID FINCHER FILM (yes, in all caps), and that's about it. There's loads of style here, but substance suffers as a result.Newly-divorced Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) and her daughter Sarah (Kristen [The Safety of Objects] Stewart, one of the film's true highlights) move into a four-story brownstone in Manhattan. (Suspend one's disbelief, for the moment, that one could actually FIND a four-story brownstone in Manhattan on the market.) The house was equipped with a panic room by its previous owner, a paranoid and very rich financier. Needless to say, the night Meg and Sarah move in, three guys break into the house, looking for the paranoid financier's money, which, as we're told in the beginning, has never been found.The first review of the movie I read quipped that ""one day, David Fincher will make a movie entirely without light."" The reviewer neglected to add that the same movie will probably take place completely outside in the rain. To further telegraph that this is, in fact, a David Fincher film, we get the nausea-inducing camera tricks of moving between floors, etc., through various air vents and the like (and through walls when nothing convenient is available). And while the film does ostensibly have humans in it, it's obvious within twenty minutes that the stars of this film are the dark, the rain, and the camera.That said, there's some decent acting in here. Kristen Stewart has already been mentioned, but she deserves another mention. She's good. Jodie Foster does what she can with a limited script (we're given many signs at the beginning that she's claustrophobic, but then when they actually get themselves into the panic room, her claustrophobia magically goes away. Ain't life grand?), as does the usually brilliant Forest Whitaker. Whitaker, along with Jared Leto and Dwight Yoakam, are the three invaders. Leto shows absolutely nothing of the talent that made him so watchable in Requiem for a Dream, but Yoakam (South of Heaven West of Hell, Sling Blade, etc.) gives a career-making performance as the only invader who actually seems as if he's a bad guy. (Another script point woefully underdone: loads of possible tension between Yoakam, Stewart, and Whitaker in an extended scene that, in the hands of the right director, could have been a movie in itself [think Polanski's Death and the Maiden, e.g.].) Also, Ann Magnuson's all-too-brief performance as the real estate agent at the beginning of the movie was up to, well, Ann Magnuson's usual standards. Too bad she never shows up again.I will say in passing that, in the screening I attended, I seemed to be in the minority. The audience (one wonders if they caught Se7en, The Game, or any of Fincher's other superior films) was completely taken in, cheering for the good guys, booing the bad guys, etc. Fincher does manage enough shameless emotional manipulation to make this movie worth killing two hours of your time, but you're much better served waiting for the rental. **",2,Fincher takes a header.,1017619200,"04 1, 2002",2002,3246,"['Panic', 'Room', 'David', 'Fincher', '2002', 'used', 'think', 'David', 'Fincher', 'was', 'incapable', 'making', 'bad', 'movie', 'Even', 'last', 'few', 'scenes', 'Fight', 'Club', 'painfully', 'hokey', 'were', 'did', ""n't"", 'set', 'up', 'whole', 'two', 'hours', 'badness', 'be', 'fair', 'Panic', 'Room', ""n't"", 'bad', 'DAVID', 'FINCHER', 'FILM', 'yes', 'caps', 'loads', 'style', 'here', 'substance', 'suffers', 'result.Newly-divorced', 'Meg', 'Altman', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'daughter', 'Sarah', 'Kristen', 'Safety', 'Objects', ']', 'Stewart', 'one', 'film', 'true', 'highlights', 'move', 'four-story', 'brownstone', 'Manhattan', 'Suspend', 'one', 'disbelief', 'moment', 'one', 'could', 'actually', 'FIND', 'four-story', 'brownstone', 'Manhattan', 'market', 'house', 'was', 'equipped', 'panic', 'room', 'previous', 'owner', 'paranoid', 'very', 'rich', 'financier', 'Needless', 'say', 'night', 'Meg', 'Sarah', 'move', 'three', 'guys', 'break', 'house', 'looking', 'paranoid', 'financier', 'money', ""'re"", 'told', 'beginning', 'never', 'been', 'found.The', 'first', 'review', 'movie', 'read', 'quipped', 'one', 'day', 'David', 'Fincher', 'will', 'make', 'movie', 'entirely', 'light', 'reviewer', 'neglected', 'add', 'same', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'take', 'place', 'completely', 'rain', 'further', 'telegraph', 'fact', 'David', 'Fincher', 'film', 'get', 'nausea-inducing', 'camera', 'tricks', 'moving', 'floors', 'etc.', 'various', 'air', 'vents', 'like', 'walls', 'when', 'nothing', 'convenient', 'available', 'film', 'ostensibly', 'have', 'humans', 'obvious', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'stars', 'film', 'are', 'dark', 'rain', 'camera.That', 'said', 'decent', 'acting', 'here', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'already', 'been', 'mentioned', 'mention', 'good', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'what', 'can', 'limited', 'script', ""'re"", 'given', 'many', 'signs', 'beginning', 'claustrophobic', 'then', 'when', 'actually', 'get', 'panic', 'room', 'claustrophobia', 'magically', 'away', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'life', 'grand', 'usually', 'brilliant', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Whitaker', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'are', 'three', 'invaders', 'Leto', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'talent', 'made', 'so', 'watchable', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'Yoakam', 'South', 'Heaven', 'West', 'Hell', 'Sling', 'Blade', 'etc', 'career-making', 'performance', 'only', 'invader', 'who', 'actually', 'bad', 'guy', 'script', 'point', 'woefully', 'underdone', 'loads', 'possible', 'tension', 'Yoakam', 'Stewart', 'Whitaker', 'extended', 'scene', 'hands', 'right', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'movie', '[', 'think', 'Polanski', 'Death', 'Maiden', 'e.g.', ']', 'Also', 'Ann', 'Magnuson', 'all-too-brief', 'performance', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'beginning', 'movie', 'was', 'up', 'well', 'Ann', 'Magnuson', 'usual', 'standards', 'Too', 'bad', 'never', 'up', 'again.I', 'will', 'say', 'passing', 'screening', 'attended', 'seemed', 'be', 'minority', 'audience', 'one', 'wonders', 'caught', 'Se7en', 'Game', 'Fincher', 'other', 'superior', 'films', 'was', 'completely', 'taken', 'cheering', 'good', 'guys', 'booing', 'bad', 'guys', 'etc', 'Fincher', 'manage', 'enough', 'shameless', 'emotional', 'manipulation', 'make', 'movie', 'killing', 'two', 'hours', 'time', ""'re"", 'much', 'better', 'served', 'waiting', 'rental', '**']",N/A

Since there are a ton of reviews already, I'll spare you the plot summary. Suffice it to say that Jodie Foster's claustrophobia needed to be way more evident and spotlighted throughout the movie. I needed to feel trapped in the panic room, as they did, or else the basic premise falls through a bit. The dialogue between the thugs was pretty amusing, but it distracted a bit from the ladies in the room. The director did some very . . . interesting? . . . visual things with wires going through walls, following the elevator as it progresses up or down, and a 90 degree camera shift as Foster lies in bed. While they were . . . interesting (?), they didn't make up for the lack of substance to the plot or the lack of ""claustrophobia"" in the movie itself. The director also used sound, or lack thereof, very effectively--one of the best scenes is virtually silent, which doesn't always work. This plot and storyline had a ton of potential, but I don't think the director or screenplay writer capitalized on it. The basic premise is very interesting, and the break-in works, but the events of the next few hours and the ending both shortchange the potential that exists.The DVD itself was a waste, too. There were absolutely no extras (interviews, making-of, deleted/extended scences)--nothing. They might have helped a little. You might as well buy the VHS version or wait for some kind of expanded, extended, or deluxe version if you want anything other than just the movie. It didn't hold up by itself.Jodie Foster was fine, but I think her role could have been written much better to capitalize on her incredible acting skills. Forest Whitaker was very good, considering the dialogue he had to work with, and his character was marginally compelling, even with the hokey ending (sorry). Dwight Yoakam was laugh-out-loud funny when he first appeared (I think that was good), but he was turned into somewhat of a joke by the end (did they need to make him look like Michael Keaton in BEETLEJUICE in his final scene. . . ?). The daughter was fine, the father/ex-husband seemed like an idiot, and the other thug was kind of amusing until his departure (do we want our thugs to be amusing?).Bottom Line: somewhat inconsistent potential and delivery. Performances were inhibited by the screenplay and were also inconsistent throughout the movie. I've seen worse, but I expected much better.

701259,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00006684S,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 5]","""Panic Room"" opens with one of the most stylishly elegant, visually arresting and classily designed credit sequences I have seen fronting a movie in a very long time.  Would that the rest of the film managed to live up to that high quality level.  Instead, ""Panic Room"" emerges as second-rate warmed-over Hitchcock with barely a suspenseful moment to be had for love or money.And love and money pretty much turn out to be the two dominant ""themes"" of this claustrophobic thriller, which stars Jodie Foster as an embittered, recently divorced mother who purchases a spectacular home on the west side of Manhattan for herself and her diabetic teenaged daughter.  The great selling point of this property turns out to be an elaborately designed ""panic room,"" which theoretically will provide a place of safety should robbers ever break onto the premises.  And lo and behold, what should happen on their very first night staying in the place!  You guessed it: three armed men, intent on stealing a secret cache of loot hidden in a safe located right there in the panic room, storm the place and make the young mother and her daughter virtual prisoners in their own fortress-like sanctuary.  The majority of the movie is spent with the two terrified women stuck behind the implacable steel door while the three hoodlums work on ways of trying to ferret them out.The single noteworthy element of ""Panic Room"" is that master cinematographer, Conrad Hall, has managed to make the house itself into something of a character - actually a far more interesting character than any of the people we encounter in the film.  He does this by having his camera move through walls, creep along air ducts and spy on the inhabitants' activities from bizarre angles, the effect of which is that we get an impressive sense of geography that helps us to map out the intricacies of the building itself.  This is not, however, enough to compensate for an underwritten screenplay filled with hackneyed plot elements, stereotypical characters and precious little in the way of nail-biting suspense.  Particularly grating is the team of three familiar burglars, consisting of the humanitarian with a heart-of-gold (Forest Whitaker), the sardonic but ineffectual ""brains"" of the operation (Jared Leto) and, of course, the trigger-happy psychotic (Dwight Yoakum) who is called in at the last moment and ends up making life just plain miserable for everyone involved, criminals and decent citizens alike.  Straight from central casting, these three men provide us with not one single surprise in the course of the film's running time.An actress of the caliber of Jodie Foster need do little but phone in her performance in a role as shallow as this one here - which is essentially what she does.  Ms. Foster has exactly two good moments in the film: an early dinner scene between her and her daughter in which she subtly conveys the hurt and confusion occasioned by the breakup of her marriage, and a sequence later in the film when she is forced to play out the required policemen-at-the-door scene (I doubt I am giving anything away by revealing that there IS such a scene in this movie).""Panic Room"" will probably manage to get under the skin of only the most confirmed claustrophobics.  The rest of us will probably find ourselves breaking out of the theater for quite different reasons altogether.",2,pretty conventional stuff,1017446400,"03 30, 2002",2002,3370,"['Panic', 'Room', 'one', 'most', 'stylishly', 'elegant', 'visually', 'arresting', 'classily', 'designed', 'credit', 'sequences', 'have', 'seen', 'fronting', 'movie', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'Would', 'rest', 'film', 'managed', 'live', 'up', 'high', 'quality', 'level', 'Instead', 'Panic', 'Room', 'second-rate', 'warmed-over', 'Hitchcock', 'barely', 'suspenseful', 'moment', 'be', 'had', 'love', 'money.And', 'love', 'money', 'pretty', 'much', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'two', 'dominant', 'themes', 'claustrophobic', 'thriller', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'embittered', 'recently', 'divorced', 'mother', 'who', 'purchases', 'spectacular', 'home', 'west', 'side', 'Manhattan', 'herself', 'diabetic', 'teenaged', 'daughter', 'great', 'selling', 'point', 'property', 'out', 'be', 'elaborately', 'designed', 'panic', 'room', 'theoretically', 'will', 'provide', 'place', 'safety', 'should', 'robbers', 'ever', 'break', 'premises', 'lo', 'behold', 'what', 'should', 'happen', 'very', 'first', 'night', 'staying', 'place', 'guessed', 'three', 'armed', 'men', 'intent', 'stealing', 'secret', 'cache', 'loot', 'hidden', 'safe', 'located', 'right', 'there', 'panic', 'room', 'storm', 'place', 'make', 'young', 'mother', 'daughter', 'virtual', 'prisoners', 'own', 'fortress-like', 'sanctuary', 'majority', 'movie', 'spent', 'two', 'terrified', 'women', 'stuck', 'implacable', 'steel', 'door', 'three', 'hoodlums', 'work', 'ways', 'trying', 'ferret', 'out.The', 'single', 'noteworthy', 'element', 'Panic', 'Room', 'master', 'cinematographer', 'Conrad', 'Hall', 'managed', 'make', 'house', 'something', 'character', 'actually', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'character', 'people', 'encounter', 'film', 'having', 'camera', 'move', 'walls', 'creep', 'air', 'ducts', 'spy', 'inhabitants', 'activities', 'bizarre', 'angles', 'effect', 'get', 'impressive', 'sense', 'geography', 'map', 'out', 'intricacies', 'building', 'not', 'however', 'enough', 'compensate', 'underwritten', 'screenplay', 'filled', 'hackneyed', 'plot', 'elements', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'precious', 'little', 'way', 'nail-biting', 'suspense', 'Particularly', 'grating', 'team', 'three', 'familiar', 'burglars', 'consisting', 'humanitarian', 'heart-of-gold', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'sardonic', 'ineffectual', 'brains', 'operation', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'course', 'trigger-happy', 'psychotic', 'Dwight', 'Yoakum', 'who', 'called', 'last', 'moment', 'up', 'making', 'life', 'just', 'plain', 'miserable', 'everyone', 'involved', 'criminals', 'decent', 'citizens', 'alike', 'Straight', 'central', 'casting', 'three', 'men', 'provide', 'not', 'one', 'single', 'surprise', 'course', 'film', 'running', 'time.An', 'actress', 'caliber', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'need', 'do', 'little', 'phone', 'performance', 'role', 'as', 'shallow', 'one', 'here', 'essentially', 'what', 'Ms.', 'Foster', 'exactly', 'two', 'good', 'moments', 'film', 'early', 'dinner', 'scene', 'daughter', 'subtly', 'conveys', 'hurt', 'confusion', 'occasioned', 'breakup', 'marriage', 'sequence', 'later', 'film', 'when', 'forced', 'play', 'out', 'required', 'policemen-at-the-door', 'scene', 'doubt', 'am', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'revealing', 'IS', 'scene', 'movie', 'Panic', 'Room', 'will', 'probably', 'manage', 'get', 'skin', 'only', 'most', 'confirmed', 'claustrophobics', 'rest', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'breaking', 'theater', 'quite', 'different', 'reasons', 'altogether']",N/A

701261,A3UBWCLVJ6WN2V,B00006684S,"""saintbsm""","[0, 1]","The two best things that can be said about this movie are:#1 The Performances. Jodie Foster's in paticular. She brings great depth to her character of a single mom who's as tough-as-nails.Her daughter also is terrific. Just a tough as her mom and you get the impression that they really could be mother and daughter in real life. Forest Whitaker leads the trio of robbers who for some reason have to get into the panic room where Jodie Foster's character and her daughter hide while waiting for the trio to depart, which they don't intend on doing. Their performances are all more than credible with Dwight Yokam playing a mysterious robber who ends up taking control of trying to get into the room.#2 The Direction. David Fincher surely does some of his best work here and it is so cool to see the camera zooming into an object then coming out on the other side.Case-in-point: At one particular scene the camera zooms into the keyhole in the knob of a door, coming out on the other side.Another has the camera going through an exhaust fan and coming out in a different room. This creates for quite a thrilling sensation.The story itself is good, a simple enough plot pieced together and while it is quite predictable, it is also a lot of fun just watching it unfold.

But this time whats missing is a truly great story and script. We have seen this basic story before,&quot; Home Alone&quot;, to &quot;Die Hard&quot;. Two very different films, but both with the same premise. Our protagonist is trapped in a building with loved ones at stake by a group of theives.In Die Hard all the bases are covered in a fairly believable context. With Home Alone we are talking about a comedy, and kid so we have alot of room to play with what could be believable. But here we have a very intelligent adult in Jody Foster a reasonably intelligent teenage girl, and three bad guys. Two of whom aint the brightest bulbs in the box, and one who's got brains, and a decent heart. We know almost from the get go that(as the decent bad guy says) &quot;Everythings going to be alright.&quot;Kinda kills the suspense.The acting is good from Forest Whitiker, Jared Leto, and Dwight Yoakem. The teenage daughter of Fosters character played by Kristen Stewart is dead on. And as always Jody Foster is terrific.(Baring very ample and distracting cleavage this goround)The camara moves we've come to expect from Fincher are all here on constant display, and the CGI inhancing is flawless.The story and script are the problem. In a thriller our protaganist must do the same things we would reasonably do in order to extricate themselves from the situation. That is until the antagonists leave them no option except the extreme. Never happens here.This DVD is excellent in quality, and quantity. Three discs woth of &quot;how we did it&quot; info.

The story is simple, yet it is gripping, thanks mainly to the excellent camera angles.Jodie Foster is a divorcee who moves into a new house with her diabetic daughter.  The new house is huge, with 3 levels and many rooms.  But one room (the 'Panic room') is the centre of all the action.  The previous owner of the house was a very rich man and had built this panic room specifically to keep himself safe from anyone who tried to break into the house.  On the very first night after Jodie and her daughter move in, 3 thugs (including Forest Whitekar) break into the house.  The plot then develops nicely, as Jodie and her daughter take shelter in the panic room and thugs are unable to get into it.  But whatever the thugs want from the house is inside the panic room.  The rest of the story is the battle of wits between Jodie and the thugs.  Jodie tries to keep the thugs away with the added headache of her daughter needing insulin shots (which are not inside the room) and Forest and his buddies try to get Jodie to open the door to the panic room.  The whole film is shot inside the house and all the events happen on one night.It seems that Jodie Foster got this role because Nicole Kidman decided to drop out, it is good for the film that Kidman did so because Jodie is a better actress than her.  As always, Jodie Foster gives an even performance.  Whitekar does his bit commendably and is ably supported by his buddies.The direction is good and the cinematography deserves a special mention since it contributes most to the thrills.  The film slows down a bit towards the end, but that still does not make it boring.In the end, this is a tight thriller that is entertaining and worth watching.",4,A taut thriller.,1017273600,"03 28, 2002",2002,1805,"[""'Panic"", 'room', 'taut', 'thriller', 'edge', 'seat', 'most', 'running', 'time', 'story', 'simple', 'gripping', 'thanks', 'mainly', 'excellent', 'camera', 'angles.Jodie', 'Foster', 'divorcee', 'who', 'new', 'house', 'diabetic', 'daughter', 'new', 'house', 'huge', '3', 'levels', 'many', 'rooms', 'one', 'room', ""'Panic"", 'room', 'centre', 'action', 'previous', 'owner', 'house', 'was', 'very', 'rich', 'man', 'had', 'built', 'panic', 'room', 'specifically', 'keep', 'safe', 'anyone', 'who', 'tried', 'break', 'house', 'very', 'first', 'night', 'Jodie', 'daughter', 'move', '3', 'thugs', 'including', 'Forest', 'Whitekar', 'break', 'house', 'plot', 'then', 'nicely', 'Jodie', 'daughter', 'take', 'shelter', 'panic', 'room', 'thugs', 'are', 'unable', 'get', 'whatever', 'thugs', 'want', 'house', 'panic', 'room', 'rest', 'story', 'battle', 'wits', 'Jodie', 'thugs', 'Jodie', 'keep', 'thugs', 'away', 'added', 'headache', 'daughter', 'needing', 'insulin', 'shots', 'are', 'not', 'room', 'Forest', 'buddies', 'try', 'get', 'Jodie', 'open', 'door', 'panic', 'room', 'whole', 'film', 'shot', 'house', 'events', 'happen', 'one', 'night.It', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'got', 'role', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'decided', 'drop', 'out', 'good', 'film', 'Kidman', 'did', 'so', 'Jodie', 'better', 'actress', 'always', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'even', 'performance', 'Whitekar', 'bit', 'commendably', 'ably', 'supported', 'buddies.The', 'direction', 'good', 'cinematography', 'special', 'mention', 'most', 'thrills', 'film', 'down', 'bit', 'end', 'still', 'not', 'make', 'boring.In', 'end', 'tight', 'thriller', 'entertaining', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

A trio of the most severely knuckleheaded crooks you have ever set your eyes on (apart from Home Alone series perhaps, where it was all at least tongue-in-cheek) plan to oust a mom+daughter duo from a &quot;safe&quot; room that was created for this very occasion.That intriguing premise turns into poppycock quicker than you can shut a door. Questions arise at almost every other minute. Without divulging too much:* Why couldn't the crooks just come some other time when there was no one in the house?* Why did they choose to be themselves and let all the ensuing hide-and-seek take place? Impersonation doesn't really take so much brains!* Why did they just not smash the cameras or make up a cock-and-bull story to get access to the safe?* How did the bad guys know that blowing up a cylinder wouldn't send the entire house in flames, and only have the desired selective impact?* Why did the mother not bluff about calling the police with a cell phone when they snapped the phone line?Forget about suspension of disbelief, you've seen teen horror movies with more grey matter.I won't spoil whatever little value there may be in watching the &quot;surprise&quot; ending, but the truth is, highly predictable things happen and get resolved in perfectly imaginable ways -- barring of course the cacophany of the orchestra in the backdrop, which is the only thing that gives you the misconception of watching a thriller. Which this film definitely isn't.Saving graces? Some clever camera work (it is David Flinch after all) and a couple of tense skip-a-beat moments strewn here and there.

One of them is the grandson of Mr Perlstien who knows that the old man has hidden his loot in a safe in the Panic Rom. Another is a security contractor familiar with the Panic Room. The third is a hired gun, brought along by the grandson without the second man's foreknowledge.The grandson hadn't reckoned on their being anyone at home, because of the time it should  have taken for the property to change ownership. The mother and daughter escape into the Panic Room, just in time. And the intruders have to get them out, for they have no way to breach the poured concrete, and three-inch-thick steel.Because this film had gotten such poor reviews I hadn't bothered going to see it at the cinema. But after watching in on DVD, I have to say that I found it to be much better than the reviewers had claimed.

Her daughter, wonderfully done by Kristen Stewart, seemed to have a sexual identity problem. Apparently whoever decided to give Jodie a daughter, must have had a son in mind.It's nice to see a woman, playing a victim but not being the victim. She proved to her attackers that she was not going down without a fight.She reminded me alot of Sigourney Weaver in Aliens (the 2nd one).

He has this unrelenting-quest who's hell-bent on killing the innocent- people he comes in contact with. The dude, in my opinion would've been killed instantly, that's all I have to say.The main characters in the film (a protective-mother with her precious-daughters) find themselves in this ""lock-downed"" position in a Panic Room in this spacious-home which is built of impenetrable steel and concrete, that's designed to protect themselves from an impending-disater i.e. sadistic-intruders. (I'm curious as to whether it can withstand an earthquake that's 6.0 on the richter-scale, or hurricane-force winds?). This room has some state-of-the-art electronic gadgetry: A bank of TV monitors for security purposes, so you can see what's going-on around the perimeter of the house; a computerized-system that controls most of the rooms vital functions; a phone for communication; and bulletproof-glass windows. (The Panic Room's built like a bank-vault.) It also had a 72-hour kit which comes complete with all the the things you'd need in case of an emergency, and an ample-supply of food for sustenance.The intruders managed to break holes in the concrete walls of the Panic Room, eventually exposing the telephone lines which are vital for communication to the outside world. They ended-up cutting the telephone-lines thereby rendering the phone system in the home useless, to anyone wanting to call the cops to notify them about what's going-on with the dire-circumstances the unsuspecting mother and her daughters found themselves in. ""Panic Room"" is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. The vigilant mother desperatly-tries to outmaneuver these intruders by doing all she can do, to protecting her prized- assets, by attempting to free herself and her daughters from an imminent-disaster.The mother and her daughters eventually comes-out of the Panic Room unscathed, from the aforementioned intruders. With the help of friends, and the cop's who show-up way-late to arresting these scum-bags; the timing of the cop's arrival to offer them assistance seems pretty pathetic to me. It's not the best horror-flick I've seen. Because of the paltry action-sequencing, the mediocre special-effects with the dude having earned the dubious-distinction of having survived the initial blows to the face with a sledgehammer, being able to penetrate the concrete-ediface of the Panic Room, by eventually getting shot and killed after many illogical-attempts by his attackers, is why I give this movie ***3-stars***.

Don't let your friends talk to you or detain you in front of the box-office, thinking it's just an opening credit sequence.And now we come to No. 2, Ms. Foster.  Replacing Nicole Kidman who bailed out from the production (but whose voice is briefly heard as a cameo), Jodie Foster gives her good, solid performance as the heroine of modern-day thriller, who, as  always, should appears ordinary at first, but later becomes incredibly tough when required.  As her daughter appears newcomer Kristen Stewart in good shape, but the real story begins when three burglers (Whitaker, Yoakam, Leto, all typecast) break into her 4-storey building equipped with ""Panic Room,"" a secret high-tech room prepared in case of emergency.And, guys, there's a rub, I mean No. 3, the script.  Oh, if you are a fan of first-rate thrillers like me, you will be dismayed, as you easily find so many holes in David Koepp's story that you can predict what the characters are going to do the next five minutes.  Even the dialogues are barely average, one of them referring to SOS signal too banal way, making me anticipate the name of, before the character speaks, ""Titanic,"" and she says exactly the same way!  (No way!)  Seriously, David Koepp's scripts, if you remember, are always helped greatly by master directors -- see ""Spider-man"" ""Jurassic Park"" and so on and on....  Well, I admit his cat-and-mouse story is just ... adequate, but nothing more.  But what the heck is this plot hole (not a minor one, you'll notice) about door censor?  Or, how come such a rich person, who can afford to take an entire floor on the spot in today's New York City, fails to provide enough security for herself and her child?  Come on!Those complaints aside, the director David Fincher keeps the ball rolling on pretty tactfully, not boring the viewers till the film's not a little predictable ending.  To be frank, though I do not admire his technical things so much as others, it is, I admit, something breathlesstaking to watch his sweeping camerawork -- see, for example, how the camera floats in the air, from above the floor through the dark room and even a coffee pot, too.  And it also peeps through the key hole (wow, some might say).  After all, these things remain in your memory best because, for that purpose, stylist Fincher took 40 and 50 and more takes of each scene.In conclusion, ""Panic Room"" caters what we expect from modern thrillers based on our fears about our modern life in Western Civilization, especially about ever increasing crimes.

701289,A1NTXJPTFP1G03,B00006684S,"Van T. Roberts ""Film Historian""","[4, 6]","David Fincher has fashioned some first-rate films since he started directing movies back in 1992.  The Colorado native called the shots on ""Se7en"" (1995), a gripping serial killer saga starring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman as the cops and Kevin Stacey as the villain, that disturbed as much as it enthralled audiences.  He toyed mischievously with audiences in ""The Game"" (1997) toplining Michael Douglas and Sean Penn in the tradition of George Roy Hill's Oscar-winning Best Picture ""The Sting.""  The incomparable and offbeat ""Fight Club"" (1999) qualified hands down as Fincher's finest, reuniting him with Brad Pitt and co-starring Edward Norton in a pre-terrorist 9/11 opus.  Until he made the Jodie Foster crime film ""Panic Room"" (*1/2 out of ****), ""Alien 3"" ranked as Fincher's least distinguished epic, with a shaven-headed Sigourney Weaver impersonating science officer Ripley for the last time as a flesh & blood human being.  Comparatively, as the least commercial entry in the creature-feature franchise, the anemic ""Alien 3"" induced sleep rather than suspense.  No matter how atrocious ""Alien 3"" seemed, ""Panic Room"" weighs in as infinitely worse.  Only deep-fried Jodie Foster fans will savor this superficial, occasionally sadistic exercise in futility.  Actually, the producers cast Nicole Kidman, but she injured herself and pulled out.  A hopelessly miscast Jodie Foster brings a certain elegance to this unexceptional nail-biter.  Indeed, lensers Conrad Hall and Darius Khondji's atmospheric cinematography, the eerie lighting, and the looming interiors win ""Panic Room"" brownie points, not nearly enough.This inferior feminist fable takes its title from a 12 by 12 foot, steel-plated, concrete bunker inside a four-story Brownstone in Upper West Side Manhattan.  The reclusive tycoon who owned it has died, and our divorced heroine, Meg Altman (a bespectacled Jodie Foster) and her diabetic daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart of ""Twilight"") now occupy the place.  Plagued by paranoia, the late millionaire equipped the townhouse with a secret room.  This impregnable bomb shelter boasts a high tech surveillance system with a cameras that scan the premises 24 hours a day from every angle inside and outside.  The chamber contains its own ventilation system and features a separate telephone line.  During the first night that Meg and Sarah sleep in their new beds, they awaken to find themselves at the mercy of three harebrained hoodlums out to steal millions of dollars worth of bearer bonds that the dead financier concealed in a vault in the safe room.Predictably, Meg and Sarah hole up in the bunker while Junior (Jared Leto of ""Girl, Interrupted""), Burnham (Forrest Whitaker of ""Bird""), and Raoul (country singer Dwight Yoakam of ""Sling Blade"") toil incompetently to evict them.  Aside from their vulnerability as females-at-risk with flaws--Meg suffers from claustrophobia, while Sarah requires insulin shots)--these females do little to appeal to our sympathy.  Ironically, Whitaker's character emerges as not only the most sympathetic but also the most interesting.  Poor Patrick Bauchau of ""A View to a Kill"" plays Meg's millionaire, ex-husband (no relation to the deceased tycoon) and takes a hellacious beating from Raoul in a scene which will undoubtedly sicken some viewers.This tedious, third-rate tale unravels from the outset with a premise as contrived as it convoluted plot.  What veteran scenarist David Koepp of ""Stir of Echoes"" fame doesn't steal from his own scripts, he appropriates from the durable Audrey Hepburn thriller ""Wait Until Dark"" (1967) and the exciting Sean Connery caper ""The Anderson Tapes"" (1972).  The Raoul character clearly recalls the Mafia thug in ""Anderson Tapes"" that veteran character actor Val Avery played in a ski-mask with a penchant for violence.  The ending that disposes of the bearer bonds comes straight out of John Huston's ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" (1948).  Had the ""Panic Room"" been a tenth as entertaining as any of those classics, this derivative mishmash with its unintentionally hilarious histrionics might have proven tolerable.  Instead, ""Panic Room"" resembles a heavy-handed Lifetime channel version of ""Home Alone.""  Decked out in a black, tank-top to display cleavage, Jodie Foster imitates the antics of Macaulay Culkin as she battles a trio of bungling burglars.  These clueless cretins make the Three Stooges appear like intellectual titans.  Foster is a top-flight actress who shouldn't have stooped to this one-dimensional nonsense.  Koepp's script bristles with inconsistencies.  After making a big deal about Meg's claustrophobia early in the film, Fincher and Koepp unaccountably drop it from the plot when they tighten the screws on our protagonists.  The scene with the butane gas tank elicits derision more than dread, and the flashlight batteries in another scene were clearly of the Eveready variety.Don't get trapped in the ""Panic

Jodie and Forest whitaker shine as the stars. It is a simple cat and mouse game yet not a minute of the movie deviates from the suspense. It is the minimality of digression that is the key here. The director does not leave the story line to chase any ponderous or emotional moments. From when the burglars enter the house till the very end the suspense refuses to die. The concept of the panic room, the strong hold, the very room the burglars are after is novel. In many places in the movie the tables are turned and the movie goes from jodie's character has upper hand TO burglars have upper hand  sitation. In the end Jodie's character goes into the Bruce Willis Die hard mode. One pitted against the gang where she has to outwit them. The movie is violent and brutal in the scenes where it is necessary. The fun is in how the burglars try to get Jodie's character to come out of the panic room. Nicole Kidman was originally to star in the role of Meg Altman (Jodie), but had to back out due to a knee injury she sustained during the filming of Moulin Rouge. However, she did add her voice to the movie portraying Steven Altman's girlfriend and talking with Meg Altman on the phone. The movie is fully shot in a house and it's amazing how even without change of environments,sets and no expensive costume design,  one is still glued to the screen. The location is still the same house. So where lies the gem ?.

Fortunately, the movie has many surprises and ultimately is a great popcorn movie.  It is also terrific to see Jodie Foster again after a three year absence from the screen (1999's Anna and the King), and in such an accessible movie.  Jodie plays a newly separated New Yorker who moves, with her 11-year-old daughter, into a great old Brownstone in Manhattan.  The apartment features a panic room with concrete and steel-reinforced walls.  The action starts right away and continues to build throughout the movie.  The plot is fairly simplistic, but director David Finch manages to milk it for all it's worth by employing great camera trickery, including some fantastic shots where the camera zooms from floor to floor in the house, through key holes, etc.On the negative side, the characters are not well-developed and we know very little about Jodie and her daugher.  Action movies obviously don't need to have characters as fully developed as do dramas, but it still would be nice to have more multi-layered characters.  Also, the burglars are exceedingly stupid and single-minded, particularly Jared Leto who displays some horrific overacting.  Overall, however, I enjoyed the movie a great deal, as did the audience with whom I saw the movie.",4,Very entertaining movie,1017446400,"03 30, 2002",2002,1389,"['seeing', 'trailers', 'months', 'was', 'very', 'eager', 'see', 'Panic', 'Room', 'feared', 'trailers', 'gave', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'Fortunately', 'movie', 'many', 'surprises', 'ultimately', 'great', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'also', 'terrific', 'see', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'again', 'three', 'year', 'absence', 'screen', '1999', 'Anna', 'King', 'such', 'accessible', 'movie', 'Jodie', 'newly', 'separated', 'New', 'Yorker', 'who', '11-year-old', 'daughter', 'great', 'old', 'Brownstone', 'Manhattan', 'apartment', 'panic', 'room', 'concrete', 'steel-reinforced', 'walls', 'action', 'right', 'away', 'build', 'movie', 'plot', 'fairly', 'simplistic', 'director', 'David', 'Finch', 'milk', 'worth', 'employing', 'great', 'camera', 'trickery', 'including', 'fantastic', 'shots', 'where', 'camera', 'floor', 'floor', 'house', 'key', 'holes', 'etc.On', 'negative', 'side', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'well-developed', 'know', 'very', 'little', 'Jodie', 'daugher', 'Action', 'movies', 'obviously', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'have', 'characters', 'fully', 'developed', 'do', 'dramas', 'still', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'have', 'more', 'multi-layered', 'characters', 'Also', 'burglars', 'are', 'exceedingly', 'stupid', 'single-minded', 'particularly', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'who', 'horrific', 'overacting', 'Overall', 'however', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'great', 'deal', 'did', 'audience', 'whom', 'saw', 'movie']",N/A
701296,A2ASIT0JYIGHTA,B00006684S,William,"[0, 3]","I read that Jodie Foster didn't want to do PANIC ROOM, but somehow got caught up in it. The movie does provide much suspense, and although quite ridiculous in some parts, is worthy of a place in any top 20 suspense thriller list. Jodi is excellent in the role of a lady who has purchased a home fitted with a panic room off the main bedroom.  I felt they should have waited before introducing the home invasion - it just seemed too far-fetched to have that happen on her first night in her new home.  It's a minor issue, but it just seemed to spoil it.  It would have been good to build up to it to give the viewer more of a feel for the home.DVD EVALUATION - Be careful, like many new DVD's, the greedy film companies are bringing out one version, then a few months later another version.  A good example is the new &quot;Superbit&quot; version of Panic Room with improved picture quality and more special features.  It's annoying, but if you have the original DVD version you probably aren't missing out on too much.",3,"Good, not great suspense",1042502400,"01 14, 2003",2003,1018,"['read', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'PANIC', 'ROOM', 'somehow', 'got', 'caught', 'up', 'movie', 'provide', 'much', 'suspense', 'quite', 'ridiculous', 'parts', 'worthy', 'place', 'top', '20', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'list', 'Jodi', 'excellent', 'role', 'lady', 'who', 'purchased', 'home', 'fitted', 'panic', 'room', 'main', 'bedroom', 'felt', 'should', 'have', 'waited', 'introducing', 'home', 'invasion', 'just', 'seemed', 'too', 'far-fetched', 'have', 'happen', 'first', 'night', 'new', 'home', 'minor', 'issue', 'just', 'seemed', 'spoil', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'build', 'up', 'give', 'viewer', 'more', 'feel', 'home.DVD', 'EVALUATION', 'Be', 'careful', 'many', 'new', 'DVD', 'greedy', 'film', 'companies', 'are', 'bringing', 'out', 'one', 'version', 'then', 'few', 'months', 'later', 'version', 'good', 'example', 'new', 'quot', 'Superbit', 'quot', 'version', 'Panic', 'Room', 'improved', 'picture', 'quality', 'more', 'special', 'features', 'annoying', 'have', 'original', 'DVD', 'version', 'probably', 'are', ""n't"", 'missing', 'out', 'too', 'much']",N/A

How could a woman and her daughter go into a panic room to hide from three burglers be scary? I don't get that. Maybe the previews had everyone thinking it was gonna be a scary movie. Nah, it's just a thriller. Anywho, this is a great edge-of-your-seat thriller. All the time, I was like, ""What's gonna happen next?"", ""Don't do that!"" and all of that stuff we like to yell out loud.
