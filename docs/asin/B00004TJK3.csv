Even  though she is only two, like her father she enjoys quality.  I have seen  and enjoyed these videos with my daughter and I must say I think they are  very fun and informative.  When the intro song begins my daughter gives  Bear her undivided attention and listens to what he has to say.  I  recommend this DVD to all parents.  I definitely will now and in the future  as I am sure my daughter will also.  And just think.  In about 20 or so  years the DVD will not be like the videotape (worn out that is)!  It will  still be in the same shape as it was the day I bought it for her.",5,About time!,965088000,"08 1, 2000",2000,727,"['daughter', 'watching', 'Bear', 'however', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'watch', 'crystal', 'clear', 'beautiful', 'sounding', 'DVD', 'medium', 'now', 'Even', 'only', 'two', 'father', 'quality', 'have', 'seen', 'enjoyed', 'videos', 'daughter', 'must', 'say', 'think', 'are', 'very', 'fun', 'informative', 'When', 'intro', 'song', 'daughter', 'Bear', 'undivided', 'attention', 'what', 'say', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'parents', 'definitely', 'will', 'now', 'future', 'am', 'sure', 'daughter', 'will', 'also', 'just', 'think', 'about', '20', 'so', 'years', 'DVD', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'videotape', 'worn', 'out', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'same', 'shape', 'was', 'day', 'bought']",N/A

My daughter is only 10 1/2 months old so she is not going to be truely interested in the fact that there are different shapes as much as she is interested in the music and movements of the characters. My Nephew who is 2 years old totally enjoys Bear and is into learning shapes and colors and plays along with the characters when they start naming the shapes and mixing the colors! It really is a good video to have!,4,Very Entertaining!,989971200,"05 16, 2001",2001,495,"['video', 'really', 'great', 'much', 'younger', 'children', 'really', 'enjoy', 'daughter', 'only', '10', '1/2', 'months', 'old', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'truely', 'interested', 'fact', 'are', 'different', 'shapes', 'as', 'much', 'interested', 'music', 'movements', 'characters', 'Nephew', 'who', '2', 'years', 'old', 'totally', 'Bear', 'learning', 'shapes', 'colors', 'plays', 'characters', 'when', 'start', 'naming', 'shapes', 'mixing', 'colors', 'really', 'good', 'video', 'have']",N/A

The episodes are ""A Wagon of a Different Color,"" ""Listen Up"" and ""Shape of a Bear.""In ""A Wagon of a Different Color,"" Bear wants to take everyone to the market, but finds that Ojo has taken his wagon to give it a new paint job. Everyone in the Big Blue House learns about colors. Ojo learns that they can be mixed and Treelo learns about all of the great colors that make up him. Meanwhile, Tutter frets about the color of what to wear.""Shape of a Bear"" is, naturally, all about shapes. The characters learn some great things about shapes, such as that they all have their own unique shapes and about the unique properties of a rectangle.""Listen Up"" is a fun episode about sounds. Treelo makes sounds that annoy Ojo at first, but Bear helps out. Later, everyone goes on a campout.Great episodes featuring great songs and writing. A fun release.The version I'm reviewing is the original Columbia Tristar release. There's also an updated Disney version available, although I don't know if it's really that much different from the Columbia Tristar release.
