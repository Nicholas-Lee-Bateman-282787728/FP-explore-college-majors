This one is special, the look, the wide scope of the tent as in the old 50s and 60s tent meeting sings, and taped at the Billy Graham Library in North Carolina.There are not too many of the classic and beloved Old Timers anymore, but Ben Speer is here and he sings the title song, ""The Old Rugged Cross"" and this is wonderful, because as a longtime Music Director of the Gaither Homecoming Concerts, we don't see Ben sing too often.If you like the classic ""His Eye is On the Sparrow"", you can enjoy that with the rich and powerful voice of Larnell Harris.  Jason Crabb sings ""Sometimes I Cry"".But the highlight of the concert performance is the opening acts,  one of my favorites, ""Life's  Railway to Heaven"",  ""Tabernacle"",  and a fun, beautiful ""Heavenly Surprise"" with the Hoppers, and some great music my The Gatlin Brothers, ""Greatly Blessed, Highly Favored"". Also here are the Oak Ridge Boys.Included are some very loved classics.. "" I Will Meet You In the Morning"" and ""Sheltered in the Arms of God"".Bill Gaither chats with Bev O'Shea, now at the younger looking age of 102 and we see a tour of the Billy Graham Library by Franklin Graham.There is a companion to this DVD, calledBill & Gloria Gaither: Tent Revival Homecoming, and Bill Gaither promises four hours of music!  I love this one, the song choices, the Friends, the setting, and the old convention song feeling.....Rizzo",5,The feel of old fashioned tent meeting songs!,1324339200,"12 20, 2011",2011,1468,"['Old', 'Rugged', 'Cross', 'partner', 'DVD', 'Tent', 'Revival', 'are', 'most', 'recent', 'tapings', 'one', 'special', 'look', 'wide', 'scope', 'tent', 'old', '50s', '60s', 'tent', 'meeting', 'sings', 'taped', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'Library', 'North', 'Carolina.There', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'classic', 'beloved', 'Old', 'Timers', 'anymore', 'Ben', 'Speer', 'here', 'title', 'song', 'Old', 'Rugged', 'Cross', 'wonderful', 'longtime', 'Music', 'Director', 'Gaither', 'Homecoming', 'Concerts', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Ben', 'sing', 'too', 'often.If', 'classic', 'Eye', 'Sparrow', 'can', 'enjoy', 'rich', 'powerful', 'voice', 'Larnell', 'Harris', 'Jason', 'Crabb', 'Sometimes', 'Cry', 'highlight', 'concert', 'performance', 'opening', 'acts', 'one', 'favorites', 'Life', 'Railway', 'Heaven', 'Tabernacle', 'fun', 'beautiful', 'Heavenly', 'Surprise', 'Hoppers', 'great', 'music', 'Gatlin', 'Brothers', 'Greatly', 'Blessed', 'Highly', 'Favored', 'Also', 'here', 'are', 'Oak', 'Ridge', 'Boys.Included', 'are', 'very', 'loved', 'classics..', 'Will', 'Meet', 'Morning', 'Sheltered', 'Arms', 'God', '.Bill', 'Gaither', 'Bev', ""O'Shea"", 'now', 'younger', 'looking', 'age', '102', 'see', 'tour', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'Library', 'Franklin', 'Graham.There', 'companion', 'DVD', 'calledBill', 'Gloria', 'Gaither', 'Tent', 'Revival', 'Homecoming', 'Bill', 'Gaither', 'four', 'hours', 'music', 'love', 'one', 'song', 'choices', 'Friends', 'setting', 'old', 'convention', 'song', 'feeling', '..Rizzo']",N/A

What a song, and such a blessing. / &#34;Sometimes I Cry,&#34; sung by Jason Crabb (& written by his father), is right on, -what a sweet thing to share! / Another song that I always enjoy very much is, &#34;That Sounds Like Home to Me&#34; -GVB. /Gaithers' productions (CD/DVDs) are of such a variety, one has to deduce that there is something for almost everyone. I think these good people put a lot of thought into what we might like to see and hear. Now ain't that nice?It's fun to find out what is available to get me through the rough spots, and to remind me -in so many ways that I should not be anxious.  Besides it is good music. The Gaithers have such a variety that almost anyone could find their pleasure as to style and lyrics, and we can learn some history and geography too, in these DVDs.PMT",4,"Bill & Gloria, with their Homing Friends really dressed for this tent meeting-type production",1393891200,"03 4, 2014",2014,910,"['34', 'Christ', 'Alone', '34', '-sung', 'Booth', 'Brothers', 'would', 'be', '-if', 'were', 'more-', 'worth', 'price', 'What', 'song', 'blessing', '/', '34', 'Sometimes', 'Cry', '34', 'sung', 'Jason', 'Crabb', 'written', 'father', 'right', '-what', 'sweet', 'thing', 'share', '/', 'song', 'always', 'enjoy', 'very', 'much', '34', 'Home', 'Me', '34', '-GVB', '/Gaithers', 'productions', 'CD/DVDs', 'are', 'such', 'variety', 'one', 'deduce', 'something', 'almost', 'everyone', 'think', 'good', 'people', 'put', 'lot', 'thought', 'what', 'might', 'like', 'see', 'hear', 'Now', 'ai', ""n't"", 'nice', 'fun', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'available', 'get', 'rough', 'spots', 'remind', '-in', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'anxious', 'good', 'music', 'Gaithers', 'have', 'variety', 'almost', 'anyone', 'could', 'find', 'pleasure', 'style', 'lyrics', 'can', 'learn', 'history', 'geography', 'too', 'DVDs.PMT']",N/A
