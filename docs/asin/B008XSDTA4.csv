I like how the plan was to meet  by  using a wish andhow the grandfather helped with the process. The story was good by showing how they were able to accept each other and deal with the separation of divorce which tears family apart. Will bring a lump in throat and a smile to your face.,4,true to life,1364860800,"04 2, 2013",2013,347,"['story', 'was', 'brothers', 'who', 'were', 'seperated', 'divorce', 'how', 'plan', 'was', 'meet', 'using', 'wish', 'andhow', 'grandfather', 'helped', 'process', 'story', 'was', 'good', 'showing', 'how', 'were', 'able', 'accept', 'other', 'deal', 'separation', 'divorce', 'family', 'apart', 'Will', 'bring', 'lump', 'throat', 'smile', 'face']",N/A
1578251,A1RXCODDDOWXLJ,B008XSDTA4,"Patrick Yamada ""Shiroh 'niichan""","[3, 4]","Kiseki (literally ""Miracle"", translated ""I Wish"" for the English film title) is a slow-paced tale of 12-year old Kouichi Oosako's wish for his divorced parents to reconcile so that he, they and his younger brother could all live together again. While Kouichi lives on one end of Kyuushuu with his mother and maternal grandparents, his brother lives at the other end with his father and his father's rock band. In class he hears a classmate's claim that the energy released by passing bullet trains will bring wishes to pass, so he decides to meet his brother half-way to see if his wish will come true.The side stories of his friends and his brother's friends who come along for the experiment give us a heart-warming look into the minds of innocent Japanese preteens. Subtle situational humor and dialog keep the slowly unfolding story engaging as we look into family, friendship and classroom dynamics. The young actors are at their most convincing when they share their wishes with each other in secrecy.I appreciate the fact that the film is touching without falling into schmaltz. There are no sappy, tear-jerking scenes or overly-idealistic portrayals of pure, noble characters. We have a film about ordinary people in nearly mundane situations. What may disappoint American viewers is the lack of a happy ending (or even a tying up of all the loose ends). If you expect a miracle at the end, you will not be satisfied. If, however, you are content with a cute film that will give you some chuckles and insight into the lives of common Japanese folks, give it a try.",4,A touching work at a relaxed pace,1356652800,"12 28, 2012",2012,1572,"['Kiseki', 'literally', 'Miracle', 'translated', 'Wish', 'English', 'film', 'title', 'slow-paced', 'tale', '12-year', 'old', 'Kouichi', 'Oosako', 'wish', 'divorced', 'parents', 'reconcile', 'so', 'younger', 'brother', 'could', 'all', 'live', 'together', 'again', 'Kouichi', 'one', 'end', 'Kyuushuu', 'mother', 'maternal', 'grandparents', 'brother', 'other', 'end', 'father', 'father', 'rock', 'band', 'class', 'classmate', 'claim', 'energy', 'released', 'passing', 'bullet', 'trains', 'will', 'bring', 'wishes', 'pass', 'meet', 'brother', 'half-way', 'see', 'wish', 'will', 'come', 'true.The', 'side', 'stories', 'friends', 'brother', 'friends', 'who', 'come', 'along', 'experiment', 'give', 'heart-warming', 'look', 'minds', 'innocent', 'Japanese', 'preteens', 'Subtle', 'situational', 'humor', 'dialog', 'keep', 'slowly', 'unfolding', 'story', 'engaging', 'look', 'family', 'friendship', 'classroom', 'dynamics', 'young', 'actors', 'are', 'most', 'convincing', 'when', 'share', 'wishes', 'other', 'secrecy.I', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'film', 'touching', 'falling', 'schmaltz', 'are', 'sappy', 'tear-jerking', 'scenes', 'overly-idealistic', 'portrayals', 'pure', 'noble', 'characters', 'have', 'film', 'ordinary', 'people', 'nearly', 'mundane', 'situations', 'What', 'may', 'disappoint', 'American', 'viewers', 'lack', 'happy', 'ending', 'even', 'tying', 'loose', 'ends', 'expect', 'miracle', 'end', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'satisfied', 'however', 'are', 'content', 'cute', 'film', 'will', 'give', 'chuckles', 'insight', 'lives', 'common', 'Japanese', 'folks', 'give', 'try']",N/A
1578252,A2Z67Z0N89WDPW,B008XSDTA4,"pipnuts ""pnewhouse""","[1, 1]","I expected this film to be like an emotional bullet train, given the subject matter, but it is actually very subtle and very gentle, which is entirely appropriate. There are not the histrionics that you might expect from an American rendering of the same story. What you get is a gentle representation of the warmth, love, and differences that exist between two young brothers who have been recently separated by divorce, and who have to learn to move forward with change. Koki Maeda and his younger brother Oshiro were perfectly cast as the protagonist brothers Koichi (serious yet still capable of dreaming and having fun)and Ryonosuke (Slightly nuts, and inexhaustibly energetic, yet responsible beyond his years).The film handles a common situation with panache, and with a clear indication that this is a Japanese film depicting a uniquely Japanese approach to solving it. Wonderful!

1578253,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B008XSDTA4,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[2, 2]","This is one of those films that puts a smile on your face. It is all about 12 year old Koichi who has been separated from his little brother after his parents split up. He talks to his little brother all the time by mobile and just wants the whole family to be reunited. He has gone to live with his mother in his grand parents house in the sight of an ever angry volcano near the coats. Father and brother are many miles away in Fukuoakia.Then they hear of the start of the new bullet train service and a knowing friend has heard that the energy produced when two of the trains pass each other is of such magnitude, that if you are present and make a wish at the same time, then that wish will come true. So armed with this news he decides it is his best chance to reunite his family. He tells Ryunoske of his plan who in turn tells his friends. Problem is they need the rail fare, so must also come up with some cunning plans to raise the cash for the plan to work.It sounds pretty basic, but it is one of those films that although it is about the hope and dreams of children can translate across the generational divide. All of the little actors do a great job especially the two brothers who get that innocence and cunning in equal measure to be completely believable. This might be down to the direction of Hirokazu Koreeda who has allowed all the characters to have both their flaws and their strengths to great effect. In Japanese with good sub titles, this is a heartfelt film that does not shirk from the real issues around familial break down but also manages to bring the hope and innocence of youth into the mix for a genuinely enjoyable film experience.",4,Bullet Trains and a Child's Wish,1372809600,"07 3, 2013",2013,1666,"['one', 'films', 'smile', 'face', '12', 'year', 'old', 'Koichi', 'who', 'been', 'separated', 'little', 'brother', 'parents', 'split', 'up', 'little', 'brother', 'time', 'mobile', 'just', 'whole', 'family', 'be', 'reunited', 'gone', 'live', 'mother', 'grand', 'parents', 'house', 'sight', 'ever', 'angry', 'volcano', 'coats', 'Father', 'brother', 'are', 'many', 'miles', 'away', 'Fukuoakia.Then', 'hear', 'start', 'new', 'bullet', 'train', 'service', 'knowing', 'friend', 'heard', 'energy', 'produced', 'when', 'two', 'trains', 'pass', 'other', 'such', 'magnitude', 'are', 'present', 'make', 'wish', 'same', 'time', 'then', 'wish', 'will', 'come', 'true', 'So', 'armed', 'news', 'best', 'chance', 'reunite', 'family', 'Ryunoske', 'plan', 'who', 'turn', 'tells', 'friends', 'Problem', 'need', 'rail', 'fare', 'so', 'must', 'also', 'come', 'up', 'cunning', 'plans', 'raise', 'cash', 'plan', 'work.It', 'sounds', 'pretty', 'basic', 'one', 'films', 'hope', 'dreams', 'children', 'can', 'translate', 'generational', 'divide', 'little', 'actors', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'especially', 'two', 'brothers', 'who', 'get', 'innocence', 'cunning', 'equal', 'measure', 'be', 'completely', 'believable', 'might', 'be', 'down', 'direction', 'Hirokazu', 'Koreeda', 'who', 'allowed', 'characters', 'have', 'flaws', 'strengths', 'great', 'effect', 'Japanese', 'good', 'sub', 'titles', 'heartfelt', 'film', 'not', 'shirk', 'real', 'issues', 'familial', 'break', 'down', 'also', 'bring', 'hope', 'innocence', 'youth', 'mix', 'genuinely', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'experience']",N/A
