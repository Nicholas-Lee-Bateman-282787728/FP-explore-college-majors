186051,A1ZOF747O5EB6R,1572521775,Andrew Desmond,"[3, 3]","With the death this week of Edward Woodward, the star of ""Breaker Morant"", I thought it timely to have another look at this film which is now almost thirty years old.  And I'm very glad that I did make the effort.  This is simply a wonderful film that doesn't date.Set in 1901 during the Boer war, ""Breaker Morant"" is, essentially, a court room drama.  It covers the trial of two Australians and an Englishman serving with the Bush Veldt Carbineers.  This was an irregular unit established by the British to fight behind the lines in a war that was coming to be increasingly defined by guerrilla tacts.  Indeed, the word ""commando"" is a Boer word meaning a soldier living off the land and mounting surprise attacks behind enemy lines.  It's interesting to think how much of modern war now plays out in this manner.The trio are tried with murdering civilians including a missionary.  They plead not guilty using what would come to be known as the Nuremburg defence; that is, they claimed to be just following orders.  However, there are larger forces at work and the trio are mere pawns in this game.  The tension gradually builds with the courtroom evidence and the use of flash backs to actual events.  This technique is brilliantly handled by director Bruce Beresford.The role of Breaker Morant is played by Edward Woodward and he performs the task superbly.  He is ably backed by an ensemble of Australia actors with Jack Thompson as the defence counsel rising to the occasion.  We also see a young Brian Brown playing Peter Hancock, one of the accused.Despite being set against the background of war, ""Breaker Morant"" is not a war movie.  Rather, it is a brilliant court room drama of the highest order.  Make an effort.

The set designers and costume designers had a real eye for detail here.  The dialogue is also very well wrought.  And the cinematography is very fine as well.Rather than a ""war picture,"" I would call this a ""costume drama""--somewhat in the vein of Masterpiece Theater.The depection of turn-of-the-century Empire politics is shrewdly executed, and the film highlights a frequently forgotten milestone in historical-geo-political events: the South African (or Boer) War turned out to be a nasty campaign for the English: it lasted much too long (1899-1902); the Brits themselves unnecessiarly lost too many men; and there was too much collaterial damage--e.g., Boer (Dutch) women and children placed in exposed concentration camps, etc.It was an ugly mess and an issue for the Germans to scrape over.And it came at a time of rising lower-middle class and working class prosperity and influence in Britain, with an increasingly independant and critical popular media (newspapers and journals).  In the home Islands it was recognized that the war had been grossly mismanaged.Bottom line: the Boer War was the first national-political scandal to really shake the hold of the ruling class (gentry and aristocracy) in Britain.

The British command is obviously using the three as scapegoats to convince the Germans, who seem eager to join the war on the side of the Boers, to stay out. The men claim they were only following orders, orders which went against ""normal"" military practice. This is a new type of warfare: the Boers fought as guerrillas, not in uniform, not by ""the rules."" The Australians on trial felt they were engaging them on those terms. The morality of war itself, therefore, is just as much on trial as these men. They all lose in the end.

It's nice to see a historical film about the ambiguity and injustice of war set in an era other than Vietnam.  War and politics have never been black and white.Aside from the message, this film is well directed and acted.  The cast are all outstanding especially Edward Woodward (Breaker Morant) and Jack Thompson (the lawyer, Major Thomas).  The film is evenly paced and moves along briskly.  The scenery is outstanding and adds so much to the sense of vastness.  The costumes and sets are authentic and add great detail.  The film quality is a little substandard but not distracting, however with the beautiful cinema-photography I would really like to see a remastered edition.  As for extras there are none to speak of.The story is riveting and is comparable to other courtroom dramas like A Few Good Men.  The blatant railroading of the three soliders is frustrating and it's thrilling to see Major Thomas's minor victories.  Despite the serious subject matter the film has several humorous moments.

I have been a life long lover of good movies and this one is truly one of the best. I have owned it for many years, first taped from TV, then purchased a DVD, which either was loaned and not returned, or misplaced, so I bought another. I cannot count the times I have viewed and enjoyed it, as have several of my seven grown sons, one of whom is now working for a government contractor in Afghanistan. We e-mail back and forth regularly and he still frequently uses quotes from this movie. It first introduced me to Australian actors Edward Woodward, Jack Thompson and Bryan Brown, all of whom I have followed through the past thirty years since the movie was made. In today's (12/28/09) Incredible Inman newspaper column, a Massachesetts reader was inquiring the identity of the actor who starred in The Equalizer, a TV series, the same Edward Woodward who brilliantly played the breaker of horses who starred herein as a Lieutenant in the Aussie contingent fighting in the Boer War in Africa in the early 1900's. I would classify this as a must-see movie. The acting, settings, costumes, lighting, and the drama are all first class and more, if there can be more. It is based on a true story, character, and history of a war few know much about except for the name of the war itself. It centers on one of the best court trials ever filmed and is chock full of unforgettable characters as well as dialogue and memorable quotes one will not soon forget.

Even then I had read many books about the British empire, even one history on the Zulu wars, so I had something of a context for the movie. I was thinking about Breaker Morant again the other day and decided to order it from Amazon and watch it once more. I am glad I did. The movie is as excellent as I remember it. This is a courtroom drama of three Australian soldiers brought up on charges of shooting enemy prisoners, despite the fact they were acting under orders when doing so. Between the courtroom scenes one is treated to vignettes of the soldiers in the field where the events happened. The movie, based on actual events, is stirring, poignant and obviously memorable. Well worth watching.It does an excellent job of portraying the differences betwixt the British and Australian national characters and the underlying tensions between these groups. It also shows how geopolitical events can conspire to make scapegoats of good, decent, and loyal soldiers. In this case the British are forced to prosecute these soldiers in order to appease the Germans, who at the time of these events had the most powerful army in the world. If the Germans had weighed in on the side of the Boers it would have been disastrous for the British. In order to avoid this the Australians are tried as war criminals. Thus WWI was avoided for another 15 years.The movie is eerily prescient of so many problems which plague the world today. The problems of fighting an enemy who is not in uniform, who employs hit and run guerilla tactics, and who is not a soldier of sovereign nation. How do you fight them? What rules do you adhere to if they do not adhere to your rules? If you capture them, how do you treat them? These are issues we have been dealing with since the events of this movie and are caught up with yet today with the war on terrorism. It is all to easy to imagine the military today offering up it's own soldiers as scapegoats in order to bring the conflict in Iraq to an end. Beneath the stirring courtroom drama, the movie also shows how so many other elements of our current military and world situtation have roots in this conflict. The special forces units we employ, even the word Commando, trace their roots to the Boer conflict. Concentration camps trace their roots to the Boer war as well, an invention of the British, not the Germans. Even the shooting of prisoners, despite being under orders, and the treatment of insurgents, harkens to scenes of Nuremberg and Guatanamo Bay.The movie is well worth watching for it's historicity, showing early developments in guerilla war, concentration camps, terrorism, counter-insurgency tactics, and special forces, as well as the slow slide of the British empire and how geopolitical forces can grind indivudal soldiers to dust as easily as enemy actions. It is also a splendid courtroom drama on top of all that.

It tells a straightforward story of true events that came to pass after the Boer War ended in 1900, in which a pair of valiant Colonial soldiers, one of whom a former horse ""breaker"" named Morant, are executed by firing squad in a probable and in some quarters still infamous miscarriage of justice. Victory having been achieved in this unpopular South African war, the British begin to mend fences with the uneasy Boer population and to that end seek out scapegoats whose punishment might appease Boer resentment over the savagery with which the British waged their anti-guerilla fight in the closing days of the hostilities. Selecting veterans responsible for the ""execution"" of members of a Boer partisan group, the British hierarchy gives world-wide center stage to this trial, and later to the punishment of two men (a third member of the accused trio is later spared death) most directly at the heart of the incident in which armed Boers masquerading as civilians died. This judicial action divided segments of the British population and engendered considerable resentment in Australia, as the soldiers put to death were brave and loyal military members, much needed by the Empire in a time of war and suddenly dispensable in a time of uneasy peace. It should also be noted that the Boers the condemned men shot that day were almost certainly guilty of being clandestine insurrectionists responsible for direct attacks on British forces in a conflict in which the distinctions between friend and foe had long since blurred and in which the rules of ""civilized"" Victorian-era combat had broken down in a very modern way.And of course as I mentioned Breaker Morant is also unavoidably metaphorical, as it was somewhat intended to be. The men killed by firing squad were a sort of ""anymen"" fighting in ""anywar"" be they British in Africa a century since, Americans in Vietnam forty years ago, or service personnel in Iraq today. In war there will always be cruelties, human beings under great pressure will on occasion snap, and when faced with an enemy who clothes himself in the guise of civilians, an individual's judgment of right and wrong will always fade from sharp focus.Breaker Morant is a good film, and its story is universal.And sad.",4,A Story And A Metaphor,1171584000,"02 16, 2007",2007,2371,"['Breaker', 'Morant', 'fine', 'Australian', 'film', 'made', 'generation', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'one', 'two', 'ways', 'either', 'being', 'equally', 'valid', 'straightforward', 'story', 'true', 'events', 'came', 'pass', 'Boer', 'War', 'ended', '1900', 'pair', 'valiant', 'Colonial', 'soldiers', 'one', 'whom', 'former', 'horse', 'breaker', 'named', 'Morant', 'are', 'executed', 'firing', 'squad', 'probable', 'quarters', 'still', 'infamous', 'miscarriage', 'justice', 'Victory', 'having', 'been', 'achieved', 'unpopular', 'South', 'African', 'war', 'British', 'begin', 'mend', 'fences', 'uneasy', 'Boer', 'population', 'end', 'seek', 'out', 'scapegoats', 'punishment', 'might', 'appease', 'Boer', 'resentment', 'savagery', 'British', 'waged', 'anti-guerilla', 'fight', 'closing', 'days', 'hostilities', 'Selecting', 'veterans', 'responsible', 'execution', 'members', 'Boer', 'partisan', 'group', 'British', 'hierarchy', 'world-wide', 'center', 'stage', 'trial', 'later', 'punishment', 'two', 'men', 'third', 'member', 'accused', 'trio', 'later', 'spared', 'death', 'most', 'directly', 'heart', 'incident', 'armed', 'Boers', 'masquerading', 'civilians', 'died', 'judicial', 'action', 'divided', 'segments', 'British', 'population', 'engendered', 'considerable', 'resentment', 'Australia', 'soldiers', 'put', 'death', 'were', 'brave', 'loyal', 'military', 'members', 'much', 'needed', 'Empire', 'time', 'war', 'suddenly', 'dispensable', 'time', 'uneasy', 'peace', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'noted', 'Boers', 'condemned', 'men', 'shot', 'day', 'were', 'almost', 'certainly', 'guilty', 'being', 'clandestine', 'insurrectionists', 'responsible', 'direct', 'attacks', 'British', 'forces', 'conflict', 'distinctions', 'friend', 'foe', 'had', 'long', 'blurred', 'rules', 'civilized', 'Victorian-era', 'combat', 'had', 'broken', 'down', 'very', 'modern', 'way.And', 'course', 'mentioned', 'Breaker', 'Morant', 'also', 'unavoidably', 'metaphorical', 'was', 'somewhat', 'intended', 'be', 'men', 'killed', 'firing', 'squad', 'were', 'sort', 'anymen', 'fighting', 'anywar', 'be', 'British', 'Africa', 'century', 'Americans', 'Vietnam', 'forty', 'years', 'ago', 'service', 'personnel', 'Iraq', 'today', 'war', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'cruelties', 'human', 'beings', 'great', 'pressure', 'will', 'occasion', 'snap', 'when', 'faced', 'enemy', 'who', 'guise', 'civilians', 'individual', 'judgment', 'right', 'wrong', 'will', 'always', 'fade', 'sharp', 'focus.Breaker', 'Morant', 'good', 'film', 'story', 'universal.And', 'sad']",N/A

This film is very well directed and packs an emotional punch.

William Calley during the Vietnam War, namely should a soldier be punished for following orders?The answer to that question depends not only on what the orders were--that is, were they legitimate orders consistent with the ""rules of war""--but also on who is asking the question and why they are asking it.  After WWII the Allies asked the question and the reason they asked it was because so many people were horrified by Nazi atrocities and wanted someone to punish.  If the Axis powers had somehow won the war they might have tried US President Harry S Truman and others for the atomic bombings of the Japanese cities, or indeed for the fire bombings of Dresden.  In Vietnam we asked the question of ourselves during the war because our government and military were being accused both at home and abroad of waging a unjustified war and going against our own value system.Here the story goes back to the Boer War a hundred years ago in South Africa, as the British command for political reasons puts Lt. Breaker Morant, an Australian soldier fighting with the British forces, and two of his fellow Bushveldt Carbineers on trial for shooting Boer prisoners.  Their defense is the same as the Nazi soldiers and that of Lt. Calley: they were just following orders.The superb direction by Bruce Beresford (from the play by Kenneth Ross) makes us identify with Morant (Edward Woodward), Lt. Peter Handcock (Bryan Brown) and the third soldier because we can see that the horrors of war pervert the usual logic of right and wrong so completely that we can appreciate what drove them to do what they did.  Jack Thompson, playing defense attorney Major J. F. Thomas, expresses this when he tells the court that war changes us and that therefore the usual rules of conduct no longer apply.  Incidentally this film is based on actual events.Regardless of which side of this very vexing question you come down on, I can promise you will enjoy this outstanding film, winner of 10 Australian Film Institute Awards.

186069,A2ZHZ8ZTHJKOS0,1572521775,Douglas Doepke,"[1, 3]","So, who says the movies are strictly an entertainment medium. Occasionally a burst of  reality manages to sneak through. In Breaker Morant we're shown what most of us suspect anyway-- that in war, the demands of politics trump the demands of justice. Kubrick revealed the lesson in 1958's Paths of Glory, where it was the French high command sacrificing three hapless dogfaces to protect France's war effort or at least those charged with waging it. Here it's the fabled British Empire on which the sun never sets and whose responsibility never ceases. It's a heavy burden-- civilizing the rabble, known to Kipling and his acolytes as the White Man's Burden. But then, it's got to be the correct white men doing the civilizing and maybe helping themselves at the same time to whatever riches the land may offer. The South African Boers simply won't do. Look at them-- there're a scruffy lot and besides they're blood related to those other white men wanting to create an Empire, the Germans. Can't have all those subjugated black Africans responding to two civilizing saviors at the same time. One has to go.Fine screenplay, a needed corrective to all those heroic  ""thin red line"" celebrations that propagandized the Western world for decades. The trouble here is that the Boers fight dirty. They don't line up in disciplined squadrons and fight in a civilized manner. They're sort of like those rustic American colonists conducting guerilla raids when and where they can. Funny how motivated the rabble can be when they're fighting for their homes and way of life. But the British are a disciplined lot. They don't take their responsibilities lightly. Just watch the robotic precision with which they execute their deadly hierarchy. The foot stomping obeisances to authority and tradition are a matter of deep-down pride in Crown, God, and Empire.However, the Aussies are only half British. They don't even stuff easily into the regimented coffins at movie's end. Here the three Aussie officers are no angels. They take their orders literally, and when the British high command says take no prisoners, they obey and shoot the hapless captives with no second thoughts. But then the Dutch Boers are no angels either, mutilating the unlucky British when they can. There's a message here, one that Americans in Iraq should take heed of. People defending their homes and way of life don't fight fair. They tend to get upset with foreign invaders telling them how to live. And, as the movie shows, don't expect the boys sent on the civilizing mission to come back the way they left. There's a price to pay for fighting in a dirty imperial war when it's not your home or livelihood you're defending. That's what's so unsettling to believers in the White Man's Burden about a screenplay like this. As Morant and especially the earnest attorney learn too late, such wars are not about justice or noble ideals. They're about power, raw imperial power, whether it's the South Africa of yesterday or the Iraq of today. And those mighty wheels of Empire are capable of running over anything and anybody who gets in the proverbial way. Here those wheels grind in a dramatically grievous manner, and one you're not likely to forget.--------------------",5,Lessons from History,1212883200,"06 8, 2008",2008,3239,"['So', 'who', 'movies', 'are', 'strictly', 'entertainment', 'medium', 'Occasionally', 'burst', 'reality', 'manages', 'sneak', 'Breaker', 'Morant', ""'re"", 'shown', 'what', 'most', 'suspect', 'anyway', 'war', 'demands', 'politics', 'trump', 'demands', 'justice', 'Kubrick', 'revealed', 'lesson', '1958', 'Paths', 'Glory', 'where', 'was', 'French', 'high', 'command', 'sacrificing', 'three', 'hapless', 'dogfaces', 'protect', 'France', 'war', 'effort', 'least', 'charged', 'waging', 'Here', 'fabled', 'British', 'Empire', 'sun', 'never', 'sets', 'responsibility', 'never', 'heavy', 'burden', 'civilizing', 'rabble', 'known', 'Kipling', 'acolytes', 'White', 'Man', 'Burden', 'then', 'got', 'be', 'correct', 'white', 'men', 'doing', 'civilizing', 'maybe', 'helping', 'same', 'time', 'riches', 'land', 'may', 'offer', 'South', 'African', 'Boers', 'simply', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'Look', ""'re"", 'scruffy', 'lot', ""'re"", 'blood', 'related', 'other', 'white', 'men', 'wanting', 'create', 'Empire', 'Germans', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'subjugated', 'black', 'Africans', 'responding', 'two', 'civilizing', 'saviors', 'same', 'time', 'One', 'go.Fine', 'screenplay', 'needed', 'corrective', 'heroic', 'thin', 'red', 'line', 'celebrations', 'propagandized', 'Western', 'world', 'decades', 'trouble', 'here', 'Boers', 'fight', 'dirty', 'do', ""n't"", 'line', 'up', 'disciplined', 'squadrons', 'fight', 'civilized', 'manner', ""'re"", 'sort', 'rustic', 'American', 'colonists', 'conducting', 'guerilla', 'raids', 'when', 'where', 'can', 'Funny', 'how', 'motivated', 'rabble', 'can', 'be', 'when', ""'re"", 'fighting', 'homes', 'way', 'life', 'British', 'are', 'disciplined', 'lot', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'responsibilities', 'lightly', 'Just', 'watch', 'robotic', 'precision', 'execute', 'deadly', 'hierarchy', 'foot', 'stomping', 'obeisances', 'authority', 'tradition', 'are', 'matter', 'deep-down', 'pride', 'Crown', 'God', 'Empire.However', 'Aussies', 'are', 'only', 'half', 'British', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'stuff', 'easily', 'regimented', 'coffins', 'movie', 'end', 'Here', 'three', 'Aussie', 'officers', 'are', 'angels', 'take', 'orders', 'literally', 'when', 'British', 'high', 'command', 'take', 'prisoners', 'obey', 'shoot', 'hapless', 'second', 'thoughts', 'then', 'Dutch', 'Boers', 'are', 'angels', 'mutilating', 'unlucky', 'British', 'when', 'can', 'message', 'here', 'one', 'Americans', 'Iraq', 'should', 'take', 'heed', 'People', 'defending', 'homes', 'way', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'fight', 'fair', 'tend', 'get', 'upset', 'foreign', 'invaders', 'telling', 'how', 'live', 'movie', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'boys', 'sent', 'civilizing', 'mission', 'come', 'back', 'way', 'left', 'price', 'pay', 'fighting', 'dirty', 'imperial', 'war', 'when', 'not', 'home', 'livelihood', ""'re"", 'defending', 'what', 'so', 'unsettling', 'believers', 'White', 'Man', 'Burden', 'screenplay', 'Morant', 'especially', 'earnest', 'attorney', 'learn', 'too', 'late', 'such', 'wars', 'are', 'not', 'justice', 'noble', 'ideals', ""'re"", 'power', 'raw', 'imperial', 'power', 'South', 'Africa', 'yesterday', 'Iraq', 'today', 'mighty', 'wheels', 'Empire', 'are', 'capable', 'running', 'anything', 'anybody', 'who', 'proverbial', 'way', 'Here', 'wheels', 'grind', 'dramatically', 'grievous', 'manner', 'one', ""'re"", 'not', 'likely', 'forget.']",N/A

Alpher,"[7, 13]","This film addresses (and won the Australian &quot;Oscar&quot; for best film over 20 years ago) a vexing, eternal question in the history of humankind and human conflict.  Military discipline is invoked to control what would otherwise become a savage horde.  Men (and now women) are taught to kill in the name of some identity (national, religious, subversive, for example).When to the combatants go &quot;too far&quot; in engaging their minds to the task before them?  Protecting their own, perhaps putting the enemy at some risk (psychological or physical) doing so?  Saving lives.  Is war never acceptable as a form of handling conflict, and what should be the consequences of going &quot;out of bounds?&quot;  Where is the rulebook?  Who does it apply to?  This question is as fresh today as at the near-end of the Boer War, a hundred years ago and on the other side of the world, but not further from the questions it raises than nightly news reports on NBC, CBS, ABC, and other media that &quot;report.&quot;I chance upon this film during a late night (or should I say early morning) showing about five years after its release, and have considered it one of my top ten films of all time.  It is engaging, the script is excellent, the portrayals of these actual soldiers and their superiors (including Lord Kitchener) during what no one knew then were the waning days of the British Empire, the soundtrack, all would be worthy of &quot;Oscar&quot; nominations even in the Politically Correct climate today.We see south African blacks treated as nonexistent, the pride of &quot;colonials&quot; as part of the Empire, the arrogance of &quot;true Britons&quot;--all with counterparts in every conflict.A highly political &quot;court martial&quot; is held for three Australians serving in the Bushveldt Carbineers--a unit using recently developed &quot;commando&quot; techniques.  It is a new word applied to war, and something quite different from the Napoleonic tactics seen not only at the entrance of the 19th century, but repeated again and again in armed conflicts throughout.These three men applied their intelligence and their compassion (for the death of their commanding officer) to the reduction of casualties, and psychological (propaganda) techniques aimed at the Boers, Dutch colonials living in South Africa.It was a highly political occurence...after all, the Kaiser (Emperor) of Germany, recently united and no doubt ready to enter a &quot;real&quot; conflict, was the late Queen Victoria's grandson!!!  If three Australian &quot;colonials&quot; were to be sacrificed in that pursuit, what of it?  With stiff upper lips (camouflaged with mustaches for the most part), we see this tragedy laid out in the most &quot;civilized manner&quot; possible.You will have strong feelings for and about the men involved.The United States of America appears to be the last land-occupying miltary superpower (does the sun set on the &quot;American Empire&quot;?). Given the paradoxes and tactical problems encountered in dozens of &quot;humanitarian&quot; and &quot;military&quot; conflicts following the first Gulf War, the lessons of &quot;Breaker Morant&quot; are no less compelling than in any other time in the history of warfare.  In fact, this drama makes draws one to surmise that many &quot;military tribunal&quot; concoctions--in legal language, &quot;off point.&quot;  Thankfully, the DVD edition of this classic is crisp, compelling, and produced to the highest standards.

That's a shame because it is actually a very good movie. In this day of numerous mindless action flicks with moronic plots or no plots at all, Breaker Morant provides a glimpse of good acting, directing and a real storyline. It was produced in 1980 and falls in that gap between the old legal classics like &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird&#34; or &#34;Twelve Angry Men&#34; and the new historical based films like &#34;Charlie Wilson's War&#34; .The story follows an actual event from the second Boer War in the early 1900's and the court martial of Harry &#34;Breaker&#34; Morant along with two other officers.The story is laid out in a long series of flashbacks interspaced with the courtroom scenes. I would give it 5 stars if the dialog didn't get lost in in the audio track from time to time. That is more of an audio editing and production issue than one of content but it detracts from the overall film just enough to lose one star.

This film has several brilliant performances,it's writing is witty and intelligent. I own it and I can't count how many times I've watched it, but I never tire of it.  Now for weighter matters. While this movie definitely addresses the issue of ethics and morality in wartime I think it also shows that soldiering is a dangerous profession in so many ways. One will often have more than one foe. There is the armed foe that one has been sent to fight and then there is one's superiors and peers. Warfare is the business of nations, which means there are often many things on the table besides defeating ones enemy. Politicians have a way of changing their objectives and not informing the soldiers of the changes. Previously condoned behavior can suddenly become &quot;inconvenient&quot; and the soldier find him or herself the scapegoat. What I get from this superb movie is that sacrificing one's own beliefs and ,doing what you know to be wrong, because one's superiors say it's all right, is a dangerous thing indeed. It isn't worth it. Warfare is a grim activity. Killing and survival often are and holding on to one's ethics are often the only thing one may have.

That phrase, spoken by Captain Hunt in the film, sums up the entire Boer War.  Countless gallons of ink have been spilled about that conflict, and Morant's role in it; resources for further study can be found easily.  The basic plot: three British soldiers are put on trial for the murder of several Boer prisoners and a German missionary, but they claim they were merely ""following orders.""  I think the movie provides an honest account of the trial itself, though it's clearly sympathetic toward the defendants.  Let's say that the film's premise is correct: that the British government callously offered three soldiers as sacrificial scapegoats for its wartime policies in South Africa.  Does this excuse the fact that the defendants committed non-combat, extrajudicial killings?  That's a question you'll have to decide for yourself.The good news is that this is an excellent 16x9 transfer.  The bad news is that special features are minimal: a 30 second radio spot, and a documentary on the Boer War, both of which were incredibly boring; I've had more fun watching grass grow.  Normally, I'd say that it's worth upgrading from dvd, but current prices for this movie (even the dvd versions) are ridiculous.  So while this is a very good film, I'd recommend waiting for a reissue, unless you've got serious cash to burn.  If you have no version of this movie at all (and are willing to spend the exorbitant sums vendors are asking for it), I'd say buy the Masterworks dvd edition, because the A/V quality, while not at the level of Blu-ray, is still very good, and the special features far more interesting.Although there is some action, this movie is first and foremost a courtroom drama.  The casting, both in the lead and supporting roles, was perfect, and excellent performances were given by both.  I was so impressed with Bruce Beresford's efforts in making this film that I forgive him forKing David.  Near the end, there is synopsis given regarding the fate of three main participants in the trial: J.F. Thomas (the defense attorney), Alfred Taylor (the intelligence officer, who likely blew the whistle on Morant and the others), and George Witton (the young Leftenant).  Surprisingly, humor is plentiful, albeit often of a gallows nature.Favorite quote (this occurs as Handcock and Morant overhear carpenters building their coffins):Handcock (Bryan Brown): ""Could've seen fit to measure us first.""Morant (Edward Woodward): ""Don't suppose they've had many complaints.""I was fortunate enough to buy this Blu-ray at a time when the prices were much more reasonable.

186085,A2T049UQONS0OY,1572521775,Larry VanDeSande,"[5, 5]","The many reviews of five-time Austraian Academy Award winner ""Breaker Morant"" seem to imply the film is an antiwar tirade. Not really, I'd say, because it is more about politics than war. Released in 1980 to nearly immediate international acclaim, ""Breaker Morant"" is a biopic that tells the story of three Australian officers railroaded during the Second Boer war in South Africa on behalf of the British empire circa 1902.In the film, Edward Woodward plays Lt. Harry ""Breaker"" Morant, a nickname he picked up from his years breaking wild horses. Morant and fellow officers carry out orders during the war and are brought to trial for it. Jack Thompson plays the lawyer that tries to save Morant and fellow officers Capt. Alfred Taylor (John Waters) and Lt. Peter Handcock (Bryan Brown) from their eventual demise.What did these officers do to deserve this fate? They followed orders and killed prisonsers during the war, a crime the British government could no longer stand behind once the political tide of war turned. The three were left as vagabonds, sacrificed to save the empire's appearance of doing the right thing during an imperial effort in retreat.The plot of ""Breaker Morant"" revolves around the prewar lives of the principals, and the ironies and terrors they face when they do as commanded and, instead of being rewarded, are offered as sacrifical lambs. Their trial shows the irony of their situation -- acting as good soldiers and being treated as Germans at Nuremberg by the empire that ordered them to war.""We shot them under Rule 303,"" Morant says during his trial, justifying the excessive use of force as a rule of law cast upon soliders of the empire. ""Rule 303"" sounds like a line from a military manual but is, instead, a reference to the .303 gauge rifles the Aussies used during the war. Here lies one of the film's greater ironies -- the ""rule"" to shoot prisoners was not cast in paper; it was ordered verbally and followed as if conventional wisdom.To add reality to the biopic, the production filmed on location at Burra, South Australia, a pastoral section of the country that resembled the South African veldt and the British military camp where the incident occurred.The acting in the film is 100 percent sincere and credible. Woodward, who died in November 2009, gained such international fame from the film he turned it into a gig on American network television as ""The Equalizer."" In doing so, Woodward played a former British secret agent leveling the field for average people against bad guys.The series ran from 1885-89 on CBS but never captured the charisma, betrayal and doomed destiny he and his co-stars portrayed in ""Breaker Morant."". It plays on a parable of people doing what they are told, supposedly doing the right thing, and being punished for it. This is the reality projected in moviemaking that is as true in 2009 as it was when the Second Boer war was constested from 1899-1902.If you have interest in history, war or political films or if you just like great filmmaking, see ""Breaker Morant"" at your earliest opportunity.

Unlike &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; or &quot;A Few Good Men,&quot; the trial takes up most of the film, with events depicted in flashbacks.  Also, the defendants are innocent of (most of) the charges against them.  Harry &quot;Breaker&quot; Morant (played by a still unknown Edward Woodward years before &quot;The Equalizer&quot;) led a group of Australian horse soldiers who had to deal with guerillas during the Boer War.  Because the British government wishes to negotiate a peace, Morant and two of his officers are charged with various violations of military law the most important being the execution of Boer prisoners.  Leaving nothing to chance, the British command gives the defendants an Australian lawyer to defend them who has never been in a courtroom; however, the man is inexperienced, he is not stupid.  It is clear to everyone that the trial is a sham.  This is why &quot;Breaker Morant&quot; has more in common with &quot;Gallipoli,&quot; another Australian film about British disdain for their subjects from that colony continent.&quot;Breaker Morant&quot; was directed by Bruce Beresford, who along with Jonathan Hardy and David Stevens was nominated for an Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium for adapting Kenneth G. Ross' stage play.  This movie also had one of the best trailers I have ever seen and it is impossible to forget Woodward's voice declaring, &quot;We were out on the veldt fighting the Boer the way the Boer fought us.&quot;  Bryan Brown plays one of the other defendants, but this is Woodward's film even when he is reduced to doing nothing more than sitting in his chair and letting the farce plays itself out to the end (Do not ask me to explain why it was Thompson and not Woodward who won the Australian Film Institute's award for Best Actor in a Drama that year).

186088,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,1572521775,Linda Linguvic,"[27, 29]","This 1979 Australian film is based on a true story which took place during the Boer War in South Africa from 1899 to 1902.  The British fought to keep their colonial empire going; the South African settlers who were mostly of German or Dutch origin fought for their independence.  It was a guerilla war with atrocities on both sides. The British brought in Australians to do the actual fighting, and, when a German clergyman who was a Boer spy was killed, the Brits wanted to assuage the Germans.  And so they put three Australian lieutenants on trial for shooting Boer prisoners, an act that had been accepted by them all along.  These three men were scapegoats.  This is their story.Most of the film takes place in the courtroom, which is supposed to be a place of justice.  Instead, it become clear that the three Australians, played by Edward Woodward, Byran Brown and Lewis Fitz-Gerald are being used as pawns for British politics.  Their attorney, played by Jack Thompson, has only been given one day to prepare his case.  And yet he presents some masterful legal arguments as he cross-examines the witnesses and puts the three accused men on the stand.  There is much tension, a lot of surprises and constantly fascinating.There was also excellent character development as little by little the audience discovers who these men are and the untenable situation in which they were thrust.  The name ""Breaker Morant"" is the name of one of the accused.  His nickname is ""Breaker"" because he was a horse breaker before he was in the military.  It's a good title for the film, and made me think about all the  ""breaking"" that goes on in the military.The morality of following orders gets explored in all its various forms, and the fact that is a true story made it even more interesting.  When it was over, it gave me much food for thought. And I was so intrigued that I barely noticed how good a screenplay it was and how well it was paced.

It's based on a real incident which occurred during the Boer War in South Africa.The plot revolves around a group of British and Australian officers serving in a highly mobile anti-guerrilla cavalry unit, called the Bushveldt Carbineers. After the Carbineers are ambushed by a force of Boers, who capture, kill and mutilate the Carbineers' commanding officer, the unit captures some Boers and find some of them wearing British uniform tunics taken from dead Carbineers. Because the Boer prisoners are wearing items of British uniform, the officer in charge, the Breaker Morant of the title, orders the summary field execution of the Boer prisoners.Morant and two other officers subsequently face a court martial on charges of murder. The film presents them as scapegoats who believed they were acting under orders to take no Boer prisoners but who are sacrificed to political expediency by a British High Command, under Lord Kitchener, which wants to mollify German and Dutch public opinion, which unequivocally supports the Boers.This movie raises issues which are still relevant today.Great movie - highly recommended.One point about the Amazon headers though. The headers don't mention the lead actors, Edward Woodward and Brian Brown. Instead they list some supporting actors. That's very confusing.I had to look at the graphic image of the DVD cover to see the names Edward Woodward and Brian Brown and confirm to myself that this was the Breaker Morant movie from the early 1980s and not a remake.

Over $70 for a DVD??!! Are you guys kidding? This is a really good movie, but it's not worth over $70 for the DVD. To the people marketing this at this price, give your heads a shake guys!July 2013 addition to original post. The asking price for this DVD is now $99.89!!! Alomst $100 for a single DVD????!!!

186091,ATP9LYGM6D3RO,1572521775,"McGillicutty ""DVD Fan""","[3, 3]","Certainly the most compelling ""men-on-trial"" film ever made, ""Breaker Morant"" is stunning in its straightforward storytelling and brilliant performances. An instant classic, this is a must-have for all film buffs.Based on a real incident and set during the Boar War, three Australian soldiers are on trial for killing Boar prisoners and a German missionary. The soldiers' fate seems to be a foregone conclusion until their inexperienced lawyer puts up a surprisingly effective defense. Director Bruce Beresford doesn't waste a single shot and keeps the pace tight while the cast, led by Edward Woodward as 'Breaker' Morant, delivers top notch performances.I was most impressed by the new ""HD"" transfer of the film. A far cry from old VHS pan 'n scan copy I've long ago worn out. The barren landscape of Australia which is very similar to the ""Boar"" country of South Africa really stands out and must be viewed in this new light.As good as the film is, I was less than impressed with the few extra features the DVD offers. No commentary, no cast/crew lists, not even a film trailer which is surprising in this day 'n age of DVD releases. What we do have is a 20 minute history of the Boar War done in a dull, documentary style that tells the origins of the conflict, but literally stops its story only a few months into the war. No information on how the war ended or even how the British overcame their initial setbacks. Also included is a 30 second radio spot and that's it.Despite this, I still give this release a 5 star rating as the film itself is so important, so good, so enjoyable to view that I feel everyone should have a copy for their collection.",5,"Hero or Villain, Breaker Morant is both...and niether.",1271116800,"04 13, 2010",2010,1658,"['Certainly', 'most', 'compelling', 'men-on-trial', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'Breaker', 'Morant', 'stunning', 'straightforward', 'storytelling', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'instant', 'classic', 'must-have', 'film', 'buffs.Based', 'real', 'incident', 'set', 'Boar', 'War', 'three', 'Australian', 'soldiers', 'are', 'trial', 'killing', 'Boar', 'prisoners', 'German', 'missionary', 'soldiers', 'fate', 'be', 'foregone', 'conclusion', 'inexperienced', 'lawyer', 'up', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'defense', 'Director', 'Bruce', 'Beresford', ""n't"", 'waste', 'single', 'shot', 'pace', 'tight', 'cast', 'led', 'Edward', 'Woodward', ""'Breaker"", 'Morant', 'top', 'notch', 'performances.I', 'was', 'most', 'impressed', 'new', 'HD', 'transfer', 'film', 'far', 'cry', 'old', 'VHS', 'pan', 'n', 'scan', 'copy', ""'ve"", 'long', 'ago', 'worn', 'out', 'barren', 'landscape', 'Australia', 'very', 'similar', 'Boar', 'country', 'South', 'Africa', 'really', 'out', 'must', 'be', 'viewed', 'new', 'light.As', 'good', 'film', 'was', 'less', 'impressed', 'few', 'extra', 'features', 'DVD', 'offers', 'commentary', 'cast/crew', 'lists', 'not', 'even', 'film', 'trailer', 'surprising', 'day', 'n', 'age', 'DVD', 'releases', 'What', 'do', 'have', '20', 'minute', 'history', 'Boar', 'War', 'done', 'dull', 'documentary', 'style', 'origins', 'conflict', 'literally', 'story', 'only', 'few', 'months', 'war', 'information', 'how', 'war', 'ended', 'even', 'how', 'British', 'overcame', 'initial', 'setbacks', 'Also', 'included', '30', 'second', 'radio', 'spot', 'it.Despite', 'still', 'give', 'release', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'film', 'so', 'important', 'so', 'good', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'view', 'feel', 'everyone', 'should', 'have', 'copy', 'collection']",N/A

It was a compelling drama about several Australian soldiers in the Boer War who were tried for the murder of a German missionary.  Although they made a case for their actions, they were pawns in the political game and doomed before their trial even began.  These points are well-developed by the director Bruce Beresford who co-wrote the script based on a play by Kenneth Ross.  It was pretty obvious that this was previously produced on the legitimate stage because the scenes seem exclusively made for smaller sets.  I noticed this because, as a war movie, it is limited in action scenes.  However, the drama was present throughout in the same sense that it was in ""A Few Good Men"".  The conclusion of the movie is powerful and underscored by a rousing version of ""Soldiers of the Queen"" as the cast and credits roll on.When I was a young man I was surprized one day by my grandfather's spontaneous outburst of condemnation against the British.  Where was that coming from, I wondered.  Then I realized that he was born in The Netherlands in the early 1890's and didn't emigrate to the US until he was 18.  He was just old enough to follow the Boer War as a child and have it leave an indelible impression on him.  I guess that's another reason I enjoyed ""Breaker Morant"".

Claster ""rjclaster""","[12, 14]","This superbly written, directed and acted movie ranks, in my opinion, with All Quiet on the Western Front and Paths of Glory as a critique of the morality of war.  Like them, it casts a jaundiced eye on the dishonesty and cynicism of governments, in this case, the duplicitous scapegoating by the British imperial high command against these unwitting Australian colonial soldiers, aided and abetted by the after the fact complicity of their own government (in this regard, I would question what others on this site have said about this movie dealing with the soldier's accountability for following orders that are immoral, inasmuch as their superiors sought to deny that such orders existed in the first place)However, I believe that this movie transmits a deeper message that the brutality of war inevitably has a brutalizing effect on the souls of those who participate in it even if they are fundamentally decent, honorable human beings, in this case, the protagonist, Breaker Morant, who, though he intially distained to follow the unwritten policy of executing prisoners who were Boer combatants (and perhaps those that aided them as well, such as the German clergyman in this film), was finally moved to an about face in this regard after the trauma of seeing that his best friend and the brother of his fiance had been killed and viciously mutilated by the Boer commandos.  Like Oliver Stone's Platoon, this movie displays a post Vietnam, post My Lai sensibility in this respect, but goes deeper in that it does not seek to divide people into good and bad, humane and brutal, as Stone did with the two sergeants, for what is conveyed here is that no one is immune from the corrosion and degradation that the fear and violence of deadly combat inflicts upon the mind and soul.Strongly recommended!",5,Profoundly thought provoking,1059091200,"07 25, 2003",2003,1803,"['superbly', 'written', 'directed', 'acted', 'movie', 'ranks', 'opinion', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', 'Paths', 'Glory', 'critique', 'morality', 'war', 'jaundiced', 'eye', 'dishonesty', 'cynicism', 'governments', 'case', 'duplicitous', 'scapegoating', 'British', 'imperial', 'high', 'command', 'unwitting', 'Australian', 'colonial', 'soldiers', 'aided', 'abetted', 'fact', 'complicity', 'own', 'government', 'regard', 'would', 'question', 'what', 'others', 'site', 'have', 'said', 'movie', 'dealing', 'soldier', 'accountability', 'following', 'orders', 'are', 'immoral', 'inasmuch', 'superiors', 'sought', 'deny', 'such', 'orders', 'existed', 'first', 'place', 'However', 'believe', 'movie', 'deeper', 'message', 'brutality', 'war', 'inevitably', 'brutalizing', 'effect', 'souls', 'who', 'participate', 'even', 'are', 'fundamentally', 'decent', 'honorable', 'human', 'beings', 'case', 'protagonist', 'Breaker', 'Morant', 'who', 'intially', 'distained', 'follow', 'unwritten', 'policy', 'executing', 'prisoners', 'who', 'were', 'Boer', 'combatants', 'perhaps', 'aided', 'as', 'well', 'such', 'German', 'clergyman', 'film', 'was', 'finally', 'moved', 'face', 'regard', 'trauma', 'seeing', 'best', 'friend', 'brother', 'fiance', 'had', 'been', 'killed', 'viciously', 'mutilated', 'Boer', 'commandos', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Platoon', 'movie', 'post', 'Vietnam', 'post', 'My', 'Lai', 'sensibility', 'respect', 'deeper', 'not', 'seek', 'divide', 'people', 'good', 'bad', 'humane', 'brutal', 'Stone', 'did', 'two', 'sergeants', 'what', 'conveyed', 'here', 'one', 'immune', 'corrosion', 'degradation', 'fear', 'violence', 'deadly', 'combat', 'inflicts', 'mind', 'soul.Strongly', 'recommended']",N/A

Firstly, I am an Australian, so maybe I'm biased, as it is about Australian soldiers treated poorly by their British commanders during the Boer War in South Africa (1899-1902). It is a military courtroom drama which deals with complex issues of guerilla warfare, off-the-record orders, political expediencies, honour, obedience, inconsistent treatment of allied soldiers from different countries, and a host of other complex military and civilian issues which examine just how messy and terrible war can be. The epitaph of Mr Morant, at least in the film, quotes Matthew 10:36: &quot;And a mans foes shall be they of his own household&quot;.At one point, Mr Morant and his 2 fellow Australian soldiers- who are on trial for executing Boer prisoners-even though they were ordered to do so-their defense attorney points out that Mr Morant, on trial for obeying these orders, disobeyed these same standing orders previously, but which was at the time accepted- and agreed by witnesses for the prosecution- but was now on trial for *obeying* those same orders. A veritable mess. Basically, the British denied such orders were ever given, so that they could use these Australians as political scapegoats, of how bad and irrelevant the war had become, and therefore have an excuse to get out of their war-the Australians were thus sacrificed as &quot;scapegoats for the Empire&quot;. &quot;A sideshow of the war&quot;, it is stated. Or was it the war that was a sideshow in the first place? If you don't understand, don't worry, neither do I-it was a sham of a war, but then war often is.I have heard some reviwers mention that the film was not entirely accurate-that is one for the historians-although others who seem to be in the know are adamant that it is accurate-but it is clear that these issues are universal, and can't be far from what happened. People died terribly and needlessly, on both sides and from their own side-and that is ugly and messy enough. If the film does nothing else, it educates one on the messiness of war, and gives one respect for the soldiers and civilians who get caught up in them.The film deals with the tragedy of war, but also on human tenderness, poetry, love, obedience, political expediency, and on a low budget and a great script, brings out some of the best and worst of the human spirit.Highly recommended for anyone interested in complex military issues, Australian and British history, or just a very good, well acted, and well written legal drama.

On visiting Austrlia, I bought a book by the same title and found that this story is frightening correct.The Boer War is winding down and, to fight the Afrikaner commandos, the English have formed commandos of their own.  Their control is loose and they virtually live off the land.  They travel fast and light--a necessity for guerilla warfare--and they are ordered to shoot encumbering prisoners.  They do.But now the Empire is anxious for peace and wants to throw the Boer population a bone.  They will try, and hopefully execute, their own fighters for war crimes.  Our boys, including their leader, Breaker Morant, are at first perplexed and then frightened.  They procure an army attorney who does a yeomen's job at getting them acquitted.  His main witnesses--the ones who actually issued the execution orders--have conveniently left the country.The Bushvelt Caribiniers are convicted and Morant and one other man are shot to death.  Morant observes, just before his death, ""This is what comes from making Empire.""This important story puts a microscope on the nature of war crime and atrocity.

The  historical basis of this film, if modified for screen  presentation, is incontestable.  The Breaker  was an Englishman who  emigrated to Australia.  He was a known, if not celebrated, poet as  well  as a horse breaker.  Like Peter Handcock, Harry Morant went into the army  as much for  a square meal as for any patriotic motives.  The Boer War was  distant and dubious for any  meaningful values.Edward Woodward, sheathed  in a corset for this film, is a dubious figure as a horse breaker,  but  displays a superb vehemence in his desire for vengeance for the mutilation  of his friend.  He recites The Breaker's poetry with sincere feeling and  his final lines were delivered with  the strength Morant displayed  throughout his life.  Morant's throwaway line to George  Witton as the  latter's being led off to prison that the trio were 'scapegoats of empire'  became  the title of Witton's account of the episode.  Bryan Brown's  portrayal of Handcock is almost  certainly speculative, but he carries off  the attitude of a loyal subordinate with style.  The  Bushveldt Carbiniers  were a novel organization [the British introduced the concentration  camp  in South Africa as well as this irregular cavalry force], and Brown conveys  the  insecurity this force must have felt in operating in hostile  territory.It is Jack Thompson who deserves the highest accolades for a  performance in this movie.  How this country solicitor really performed in  the courtroom is immaterial [although  Witton's book gives Thomas' full  praise for his efforts to clear the officers].  Thompson  renders superbly  the role of a man striving for justice against a clearly stacked  deck.This film may be about the Boer War, but that's wholly immaterial -  it's a universal issue.  Massive organizational power rendered against  hapless individuals covers all levels of life,  from military to corporate.  Breaker Morant offers a multitude of lessons for anyone questing  for  justice.  The Breaker's fate was a setback in that quest, but his story,  superbly told to a  world more willing to investigate such incidents for  truth.

186112,AGRR05FH945HR,1572521775,Steven Cain,"[25, 28]","A very powerful film, which richly deserves the praise it has accumulated over the years.Beresford certainly shone in this, one of this finest moments, and the cast, especially Woodward, Brown and Thompson were just superb.I read the Kit Denton book Case Closed many years ago, and the movie appears to be partly based on that. Information seems to have come to light after the event, such as Kitchener's diaries confirming the order to shoot 'enemies' wearing British uniforms in any form, and the evaluation of Morant's 'psychotic' character by some of his fellow troopers. However, it doen't really change the central issue of putting soldiers on trial for political reasons, while the gin-swilling politicians continue to mess things up from thousands of miles away.The British made such a hash of the Boer War(s) that it is no surprise that two thirds of their war dead died from disease rather than enemy action. Likewise the thousands of Boer women and children who died in the British concentration camps (the Brits invented them to 'concentrate' the prisoners into a manageable environment) only died due to administrative incompetence, not through any attempt to harm them.It was against this background that an Aussie BVC patrol were put on trial for summarily executing Boer prisoners, whom some claim were coming in to surrender. Yet there is so much that we can never really know in this case, as so much of what was believed to be evidence has been contradicted, such as whether one of the Boers had really been wearing a dead British officer's (Morant's friend) army pants.Was Morant a 'killer'? If he was, then so was Kitchener. Perhaps the main difference was that some people kill with a stroke of a pen and others with a 303 rifle.As with the My Lai massacre in Vietnam, there has to be accountability in war. No question. But it is also inappropriate to place a bunch of young men in harm's way, in an asymmetrical warfare situation, and expect them to be immune to provocation and imminent physical danger, and to react calmly and rationally in every case.It clearly was a politically-motivated show trial and the men should never have been executed, even if a trial had actually been warranted.

Breaker Morant is a 1980 Australian film directed by Bruce Beresford and starring British actor Edward Woodward as Harry ""Breaker"" Morant. This film is about what happens the bureaucratic cycle of war spins out of control. This story details the murder trial of three Australian Army officers serving in South Africa during the Second Boer War. The soldiers that stand on trial are accused of executing enemy soldiers unlawfully. The truth to the matter is that there is a bigger picture and the soldiers lives are on the line. It is revealed that the trail is actually a propaganda tool that could be used to end the war. Breaker Morant is a brutal film that brings the harshness of war to the forefront of your consciousness. War requires creativity and brutality. In the midst of war life really becomes nothing more then a numbers game. The theatrical outcome: you will have to watch that for yourself. The realistic outcome: Life can easily become nothing but a spinning gear in the ever turning machine of war.Live everyday as if its going to be your last because one day you're sure to be right.The fact of the matter is that war changes men's natures. The barbarities of war are seldom committed by abnormal men. The tragedy of war is that these horrors are committed by normal men in abnormal situations. Situations in which the ebb and flow of everyday life have departed and have been replaced by a constant round of fear and anger, blood and death.",5,The Empire 5 Star 500 - #71,1312329600,"08 3, 2011",2011,1565,"['When', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'were', 'reprimanded', 'doing', 'something', 'were', 'asked', 'do', 'first', 'place', 'Breaker', 'Morant', '1980', 'Australian', 'film', 'directed', 'Bruce', 'Beresford', 'starring', 'British', 'actor', 'Edward', 'Woodward', 'Harry', 'Breaker', 'Morant', 'film', 'what', 'bureaucratic', 'cycle', 'war', 'spins', 'control', 'story', 'details', 'murder', 'trial', 'three', 'Australian', 'Army', 'officers', 'serving', 'South', 'Africa', 'Second', 'Boer', 'War', 'soldiers', 'stand', 'trial', 'are', 'accused', 'executing', 'enemy', 'soldiers', 'unlawfully', 'truth', 'matter', 'bigger', 'picture', 'soldiers', 'lives', 'are', 'line', 'revealed', 'trail', 'actually', 'propaganda', 'tool', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'end', 'war', 'Breaker', 'Morant', 'brutal', 'film', 'harshness', 'war', 'forefront', 'consciousness', 'War', 'creativity', 'brutality', 'midst', 'war', 'life', 'really', 'nothing', 'more', 'then', 'numbers', 'game', 'theatrical', 'outcome', 'will', 'have', 'watch', 'realistic', 'outcome', 'Life', 'can', 'easily', 'become', 'nothing', 'spinning', 'gear', 'ever', 'turning', 'machine', 'war.Live', 'everyday', 'going', 'be', 'last', 'one', 'day', ""'re"", 'sure', 'be', 'right.The', 'fact', 'matter', 'war', 'changes', 'men', 'natures', 'barbarities', 'war', 'are', 'seldom', 'committed', 'abnormal', 'men', 'tragedy', 'war', 'horrors', 'are', 'committed', 'normal', 'men', 'abnormal', 'situations', 'Situations', 'ebb', 'flow', 'everyday', 'life', 'have', 'departed', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'constant', 'round', 'fear', 'anger', 'blood', 'death']",N/A
186116,ABKDVUJXBA1SZ,1572521775,Titus,"[8, 91]","On the surface, Breaker Morant is a simple story of soldiers in the field being asked to operate under impossible moral constraints. They end up being sacrificied on the altar of political expediency.But director Bruce Beresford does a masterful of job of hiding his anti-christianity in plain sight. For example, he has the chaplain recite a verse that goes something like, ""God, you accomplish thy will by war as well as by peace"". The impression Beresford leaves is that God makes war for its own sake.Second, his portrayal of the incident involving the missionary leaves little doubt in the viewer's mind that the missionary had it coming to him. Say what you want about civilians who cross the line in a guerilla war, fair enough. But I find it very disturbing that the director chose a Christian missionary, when he could have chosen anything else on earth, as a character who deserves to be murdered.Last but not least is Morant's rejection of God again symbolized by the chaplain, just prior to his death. I find this attitude to be incomprehensible. Are Morant and Handcock's deaths unjust, absolutely.But is it God's fault that men are unjust? Bruce Beresford seems to think so. Unfortunately, he forgets that God gave us the Ten Commandments to follow or not to follow as we choose. That's why we call it ""free will"", Bruce.And a pagan is not someone who doesn't believe there's a divine being dispensing justice throughout the world. A pagan is someone who believes that the divine being doesn't care whether or not there is justice throughout the world.I will say that the film is very powerful, especially the scenes were Morant takes his vengeance on his Boer captives.

The trial is interspersed with flashback scenes of the actual conflict.In short the Boers after some initial successes were defeated by the more numerous British forces. They however did not accept defeat and mounted groups of Boer farmers continued to fight a guerilla war.The Boer war was notable for a number of things one being the invention of concentration camps. The British locked up the wives and children of the Boers so that they could not be supplied while carrying out raids. Some 20,000 women and children are said to have died in the camps.This film centres on some Australian troops who followed orders to shoot captured Boer commandoes. One of them Breaker Morant was a noted poet of the time who in Australia had contributed to the Bullutein Magazine for some time. He volunteered with an Australian unit to fight in the war.The film is largely about the hypcrosy of the British High Command who were willing to order the killing of prisoners and then to deny it when their actions in South Africa were causing a stink. Some territorials were put on trial to play the role of sacraficial victims.The problem with most Australian films is that they have poor scripts. Great photography and composition is no substitute for a tight script. The virtue of this film is that it is one of the best scripted Australian films released. It is also noteworthy as a film which is critcal of the Imperial tradition. The cast is very good with Edward Woodwood, Brian Brown and Jack Thompson.
