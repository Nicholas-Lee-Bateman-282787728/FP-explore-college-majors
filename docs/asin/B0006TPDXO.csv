874075,A3JWVMLYSYQOSJ,B0006TPDXO,"AlwaysLearning ""Happy2Be""","[8, 8]","I applaud the focus of this video.  In the video, Megan Garcia performs various yoga postures with voice over commentary.  Megan looks like she is around clothing size 18 or 20.  There is a Spanish language option in the video.  The background music is the soothing, new age type. The warm-up and sequence of the postures make sense. The reason I did not give this video a 5 star rating is because there were no modifications of the poses for people who are not as flexible as Megan.  I feel the video would have been more helpful if she had included people who were larger, or less flexible.  For yoga showing modifications with a chair and people at various levels of flexibility, I prefer the Peggy Cappy videos.",4,"Yoga for the slightly larger, flexible female.",1172966400,"03 4, 2007",2007,715,"['applaud', 'focus', 'video', 'video', 'Megan', 'Garcia', 'various', 'yoga', 'postures', 'voice', 'commentary', 'Megan', 'clothing', 'size', '18', '20', 'Spanish', 'language', 'option', 'video', 'background', 'music', 'soothing', 'new', 'age', 'type', 'warm-up', 'sequence', 'postures', 'make', 'sense', 'reason', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'video', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'were', 'modifications', 'poses', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'flexible', 'Megan', 'feel', 'video', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'helpful', 'had', 'included', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'larger', 'less', 'flexible', 'yoga', 'showing', 'modifications', 'chair', 'people', 'various', 'levels', 'flexibility', 'prefer', 'Peggy', 'Cappy', 'videos']",Yoga: Just My Size With Megan Garcia
874076,A2I3TKKHF6INI6,B0006TPDXO,Connie,"[19, 26]","I am a total total newbie to yoga but here are my thoughts... mostly I could not hold the poses for ""five deep breaths"" and be done with my five deep breaths anywhere near as fast as the leader was.  I was usually on breath #2 when she was moving on to the next thing.  Plus sometimes I thought the instructions given by the narrator didn't make sense (ie I found it impossible to twist to the right while head, shoulders, AND hips all went to the right too.  Some of that stuff goes LEFT when the rest goes right.  Just a little bit frustrating, when you're learning).Also, many of the poses require that you put a lot of weight on your upper arms, forearms, and wrists.  After doing the video twice this week, I feel very sore and tendonitis-y in my wrists.The leader and narrator were not too too heavy on the touchy-feely yoga get-in-touch-with-yourself commentary.  That kind of thing is a big turn-off for me so I was glad they kept it to a minimum.I think this DVD is ok, just not great and not quite good enough to encourage me to keep at it.

This workout will also be enjoyed by anyone starting Yoga because of the gentle approach. The exercise routine is divided into three sections:Warm UpWorkoutDeep RelaxationMegan Garcia introduces a variety of relaxing and balancing poses. After Sun Breaths while sitting, you ease your body into twists and then unique hip stretches where you slide your hips to the side while in the cat/dog pose. The gentle lunge didn't hurt my knees and when you move from the floor to standing, Megan makes sure you are making a gentle transition. Child's pose has modifications so you don't feel like your stomachis uncomfortable and warrior poses are elegant and centering. You will be learning downward-facing dog and a relaxation pose at the end.The teaching style is relaxing and nurturing. I love Megan's vibrant soul and positive attitude. Her eyes sparkle with a love for life and her goal is to make Yoga very accessible to all women. The bonus interview gives additional information and explains why Yoga is so important for women.As you move through the postures, you will feel a sense of calm descending. A wonderful way to relax in the evening and this is a good introduction to yoga. I followed this workout with an additional relaxing stretching routine while listening to Kevin Kendle's Music for Yoga. If you are used to doing Yoga for an hour or more, you might want to do this workout twice or follow it with more stretching.Megan Garcia helps to create a beautiful accepting space for all yoga students and I'm very impressed with her new DVDs.

I can say that Garcia was pretty thorough in explaining the positions, the background music was soothing yet non-intrusive, and I even liked the transitional screen with its slow-moving clouds. However, the one thing which kept me from enjoying this dvd as much as I'd like is that a lot of the positions she chose to feature placed a lot of forward leaning weight on my wrists and held it there for some time. I simply couldn't do any of these exercises as the pain became intolerable. While some may not experience this problem, I think these positions should have been limited as it's hard enough for a smaller individual to support their entire upper body with their wrists, much less a plus sized person who is carrying more weight. At the very least, there should have been modifications given to address different body types. Some may think my expectations in this regard are too high, but if this video is specifically targeted towards plus sized women, the plus size body type should be addressed. Extra weight in areas such as the stomach or chest can seriously impede certain positions...but none of this was addressed in the video.",3,Too painful,1286064000,"10 3, 2010",2010,1234,"['Being', 'absolutely', 'new', 'yoga', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'other', 'beginner', 'videos', 'can', 'say', 'Garcia', 'was', 'pretty', 'thorough', 'explaining', 'positions', 'background', 'music', 'was', 'soothing', 'yet', 'non-intrusive', 'even', 'liked', 'transitional', 'screen', 'slow-moving', 'clouds', 'However', 'one', 'thing', 'kept', 'enjoying', 'dvd', 'as', 'much', ""'d"", 'like', 'lot', 'positions', 'chose', 'feature', 'placed', 'lot', 'forward', 'leaning', 'weight', 'wrists', 'held', 'time', 'simply', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'exercises', 'pain', 'became', 'intolerable', 'may', 'not', 'experience', 'problem', 'think', 'positions', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'limited', 'hard', 'enough', 'smaller', 'individual', 'support', 'entire', 'body', 'wrists', 'much', 'less', 'plus', 'sized', 'person', 'who', 'carrying', 'more', 'weight', 'very', 'least', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'modifications', 'given', 'address', 'different', 'body', 'types', 'may', 'think', 'expectations', 'regard', 'are', 'too', 'high', 'video', 'specifically', 'targeted', 'towards', 'sized', 'women', 'plus', 'size', 'body', 'type', 'should', 'be', 'addressed', 'Extra', 'weight', 'areas', 'such', 'stomach', 'chest', 'can', 'seriously', 'impede', 'certain', 'positions', 'none', 'was', 'addressed', 'video']",Yoga: Just My Size With Megan Garcia

But, and this is a big but. . . You have to watch a separate dvd extra to get the modifications--they aren't incorporated into the routine itself, which pretty much defeats the purpose.  You have to memorize the modifications and then remember them during the routine, which makes it harder to focus on the poses.  A second person doing the modifications during the routine itself would've made it much better, as the modifications are actually helpful and make uncomfortable poses more comfortable.  The routine itself is really basic and short--just 6 poses and it felt a little rushed (she says to hold poses for 5 deep breathes, and I barely got 2-3 deep breathes before she moved on).If you're a complete couch potato, this DVD would a good place to start. It's nice to see someone who's not anorexic enjoying movement.
