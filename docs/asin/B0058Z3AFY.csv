Attractive Korean actor and Japanese actress, funny Japanese character actress doing the Whoopi Goldberg psychic, again with restraint - making the emotions all the more real, not Hollywood bombastic.  Nice job, sweet little Japanese-Korean production.",5,Asian remake of Ghost,1388620800,"01 2, 2014",2014,385,"['Quieter', 'gentler', 'remake', 'Ghost', 'Role', 'reversal', 'boy', 'left', 'broken', 'heart', 'girl', 'waits', 'heaven', 'help', 'boyfriend', 'Attractive', 'Korean', 'actor', 'Japanese', 'actress', 'funny', 'Japanese', 'character', 'actress', 'doing', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'psychic', 'again', 'restraint', 'making', 'emotions', 'more', 'real', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'bombastic', 'Nice', 'job', 'sweet', 'little', 'Japanese-Korean', 'production']","Ghost in Love / Ghost: In Your Arms Again Japanese Movie Dvd English Subtitle NTSC All Region 1 Disc (Nanako Matsushima, Song Seung Heon)"

I won't spoil anything for anybody who may be interested, but I will say that the protagonist in this one is a lady. Naturally there are some cultural interjections, but nothing that takes away from the movie. On the contrary, this entire experience is quite wonderful, and stays true to the premise of the original.

I had my doubts, but both the screenwriter and director of this movie took what is now an American classic movie and made an enjoyable remake.  I loved the reversed roles in the characters in the story,  There is  a cohesiveness in the story and just enough suspense to keep you glued to you seat..  The casting director should also receive recognition in picking the right actors for the specific roles.  It is always a pleasure to have Song Seung Heon  in the male leading role.

1447626,AAW58LG72PG7I,B0058Z3AFY,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[0, 1]","Sometimes a remake is better than the original. The original GHOST with Patrick Swayze was remade in 2010 with Seung-Heon Song in the starring role as Juno Kim, a Korean born potter now living in Japan. Mr. Song has made a career of playing the romantic lead and he is supremely well cast as one who quite unexpectedly meets a Japanese business executive who takes one look at his rugged good looks and the audience can nearly hear the twang ring in her mind. Their chemistry is immediate and palpable. They marry and are happy until his wife is killed in a motorcycle accident. She becomes a ghost and the movie morphs from romance to fantasy. There are inevitable plot twists and complications with the surprising re-appearance of one of the wife's business partners with a hidden agenda. In an over the top performance is an elderly Japanese psychic who can ""hear"" the ghost and communicates with the husband in a spirit-within-a-body scene that is both sentimental and touching. How one takes all this in is a function of whether one can appreciate fantasies that remain rooted in the human condition. GHOST manages to tread a gentle balancing act between crying at key scenes and commiserating at others.  GHOST is I think a date movie that can cause lovers to ponder their own relationship even after the closing credits.",5,GHOST: Just the Right Balance,1396137600,"03 30, 2014",2014,1327,"['Sometimes', 'remake', 'better', 'original', 'original', 'GHOST', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'was', 'remade', '2010', 'Seung-Heon', 'Song', 'starring', 'role', 'Juno', 'Kim', 'Korean', 'born', 'potter', 'now', 'living', 'Japan', 'Mr.', 'Song', 'made', 'career', 'playing', 'romantic', 'lead', 'supremely', 'well', 'cast', 'one', 'who', 'quite', 'unexpectedly', 'Japanese', 'business', 'executive', 'who', 'one', 'look', 'rugged', 'good', 'looks', 'audience', 'can', 'nearly', 'hear', 'twang', 'ring', 'mind', 'chemistry', 'immediate', 'palpable', 'marry', 'are', 'happy', 'wife', 'killed', 'motorcycle', 'accident', 'ghost', 'movie', 'morphs', 'romance', 'fantasy', 'are', 'inevitable', 'plot', 'twists', 'complications', 'surprising', 're-appearance', 'one', 'wife', 'business', 'partners', 'hidden', 'agenda', 'top', 'performance', 'elderly', 'Japanese', 'psychic', 'who', 'can', 'hear', 'ghost', 'communicates', 'husband', 'spirit-within-a-body', 'scene', 'sentimental', 'touching', 'How', 'one', 'function', 'one', 'can', 'appreciate', 'fantasies', 'remain', 'rooted', 'human', 'condition', 'GHOST', 'tread', 'gentle', 'balancing', 'act', 'crying', 'key', 'scenes', 'commiserating', 'others', 'GHOST', 'think', 'date', 'movie', 'can', 'cause', 'lovers', 'ponder', 'own', 'relationship', 'even', 'closing', 'credits']","Ghost in Love / Ghost: In Your Arms Again Japanese Movie Dvd English Subtitle NTSC All Region 1 Disc (Nanako Matsushima, Song Seung Heon)"

But I have to be honest and say this one was the best of the two.  It was more sensitively done; you could really have empathy with the characters.  My wife felt the same way.  In fact, not only we two, but many others (see the Amazon reviews) feel the same way about the two movies.  It's up to you to decide, but I think you'll feel you have gone through a very nice experience watching this movie.
