There are too many flashblacks, the plot overlaps in present time, it's just one big passionless mess.

I hate a movie where someone is trying to find someone else and the whole time they are living right next to eachother or only a few feet apart!  To me, that is annoying... I mean bite your lip and kick the back of the fat guy's (who is munching on goobers) seat in front of you!  The movie was just portrayed differently in the previews.. I thought I was going to see a psychological thriller and instead I found a ""will he ever find her?"" kind of movie.  When he finally finds her... it is a touching moment but by this point the plot had been so strecthed out that the viewer was exasperated.  I mean these two characters crossed paths a bizillion times, and never saw each other...and all because of some crazy girl!!  It was just too text book.. nothing to surprise the viewer and it was falsly advertised much like Cold Creek Manor... I mean how many of us thought we were going to see a ghost movie and instead had to sit through story about a crazy guy.  Wicker Park is a story of a crazy girl and her attempt to keep the boy she loves away from his one true love.  It could have been good but it was just as if the director soaked ever moment he could to build up the ending when in fact the viewer was ready for it to end long before it actually did!

862369,A3LZAIH6S4LT56,B00067BBMS,"A. Snyder ""awsnyde""","[1, 1]","I'm not someone who watches movies repeatedly, at least not very often.  For example, I've only seen my all-time favorite, ""Donnie Darko"", only twice.  However, over the six years since ""Wicker Park"" came out, I've watched it three times, and I've loved it every time.Unlike some, I didn't find it at all confusing.  If anything, watching the storyline unravel the very first time made that viewing the best of the three.  And this is nowhere near as complex a storyline as ""Memento"", ""Irreversible"" (and one of the stars of that, Monica Bellucci, was in the original French version of this movie), or ""Donnie Darko"" for that matter (or heck, even ""Pulp Fiction"").I'm not going to go into the plot.  As Roger Ebert has pointed out, it's nearly impossible to do so without giving something away--and if you haven't watched it yet, I want you to be able to enjoy it as I did the first time.What I do want to say is that Rose Byrne's performance in this film is fantastic.  The look of pain on her face when someone reveals something to her through a dressing room door is so real that I actually felt it, as if I'd been punched in the stomach.  And despite the foreknowledge during later viewing, that visceral reaction to her acting occurred the second and third time I watched the movie as well.  During a much later scene in the film, in a restaurant, you can actually see the sickened (as in heartsick) look she gets as she realizes that she's not going to get what she most desires in the world.  Simply an amazing performance throughout the film, and I honestly can't remember ever being as affected by the performance of any actor or actress in anything else (with the possible exception of Anna Chlumsky's performance at the funeral in ""My Girl"", but that was just one scene, not throughout the entire movie).",5,Most Affecting Performance,1287792000,"10 23, 2010",2010,1815,"[""'m"", 'not', 'someone', 'who', 'movies', 'repeatedly', 'least', 'not', 'very', 'often', 'example', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'only', 'twice', 'However', 'six', 'years', 'Wicker', 'Park', 'came', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'three', 'times', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'confusing', 'anything', 'watching', 'storyline', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'made', 'viewing', 'best', 'three', 'nowhere', 'near', 'complex', 'storyline', 'Memento', 'Irreversible', 'one', 'stars', 'Monica', 'Bellucci', 'was', 'original', 'French', 'version', 'movie', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'matter', 'heck', 'even', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', '.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'go', 'plot', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'pointed', 'out', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'do', 'so', 'giving', 'something', 'away', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'yet', 'want', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'did', 'first', 'time.What', 'do', 'want', 'say', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'performance', 'film', 'fantastic', 'look', 'pain', 'face', 'when', 'someone', 'something', 'dressing', 'room', 'door', 'so', 'real', 'actually', 'felt', ""'d"", 'been', 'punched', 'stomach', 'foreknowledge', 'later', 'viewing', 'visceral', 'reaction', 'acting', 'occurred', 'second', 'third', 'time', 'watched', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'much', 'later', 'scene', 'film', 'restaurant', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'sickened', 'heartsick', 'look', 'not', 'going', 'get', 'what', 'most', 'desires', 'world', 'Simply', 'amazing', 'performance', 'film', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'ever', 'being', 'affected', 'performance', 'actor', 'actress', 'anything', 'else', 'possible', 'exception', 'Anna', 'Chlumsky', 'performance', 'funeral', 'Girl', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'scene', 'not', 'entire', 'movie']",Wicker Park

862371,A3I7YI4NMP6SV8,B00067BBMS,"B. Wells ""CineMan""","[0, 1]","Paul McGuigan's ""Wicker Park"" is like a demented episode of friends without the self-conscious humor.  Matthew is a twentysomething executive type engaged to his boss's sister but seriously pining for his old lover, Lisa, who left without a trace two years earlier.  When Matthew and his fiancee return to Chicago (following Matthew's two year self-exile in New York), Matt hooks up with Luke, an old buddy who was privy to the whole Lisa drama. Luke has recently begun dating Alex, an elusive actress who is driving him crazy.  Soon after his return, Matthew spies the long-missing Lisa in a restaurant where he is having a drink with his fiancee and her brother.  Or does he?  Things start to get really complicated from there on out, so it's important to pay attention in order to keep all the threads straight, as the lives of all the characters intersect in unexpected ways.  It's advertised as a thriller but there's nothing really thrilling about ""Wicker Park""; despite it twists and turns, it is, first and foremost, a soap opera, and one that, despite its subject matter, is oddly un-sexy.Director McGuigan does a fair job translating a French film into an American remake.  It has a flashy, jumpy quality that keeps the viewer on edge, although that doesn't always work in the film's favor.  Josh Hartnett delivers a fine performance as Matthew, the film's hero; he reminds me a lot of Timothy Hutton back in his heyday.  This is, arguably, one of his best performances.  As the long-lost lover, Diane Kruger is attractive but there seems to be something missing from her Lisa; she's not all that interesting and it's hard to believe that she cares much for Matthew.  Much better is Rose Byrne as the secretive Alex; is it a coincidence that she shares the same name as the femme fatale in ""Fatal Attraction""?  As played by Byrne, Alex is hot and cold, a dynamic mystery woman playing a dangerous game.  Matthew Lillard, as Luke, is believable but I have never seen much variation in any of his performances; maybe that has more to do with the kind of roles he keeps getting.While it starts out interestingly enough, ""Wicker Park"" becomes too convoluted and contrived to maintain its initial momentum.",3,Flashy Soap Opera,1215388800,"07 7, 2008",2008,2211,"['Paul', 'McGuigan', 'Wicker', 'Park', 'demented', 'episode', 'friends', 'self-conscious', 'humor', 'Matthew', 'twentysomething', 'executive', 'type', 'engaged', 'boss', 'sister', 'seriously', 'pining', 'old', 'lover', 'Lisa', 'who', 'left', 'trace', 'two', 'years', 'earlier', 'When', 'Matthew', 'fiancee', 'return', 'Chicago', 'following', 'Matthew', 'two', 'year', 'self-exile', 'New', 'York', 'Matt', 'up', 'Luke', 'old', 'buddy', 'who', 'was', 'privy', 'whole', 'Lisa', 'drama', 'Luke', 'recently', 'begun', 'dating', 'Alex', 'elusive', 'actress', 'who', 'driving', 'crazy', 'Soon', 'return', 'Matthew', 'long-missing', 'Lisa', 'restaurant', 'where', 'having', 'drink', 'fiancee', 'brother', 'Things', 'start', 'get', 'really', 'complicated', 'there', 'out', 'important', 'pay', 'attention', 'order', 'keep', 'threads', 'straight', 'lives', 'characters', 'intersect', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'advertised', 'thriller', 'nothing', 'really', 'thrilling', 'Wicker', 'Park', 'first', 'foremost', 'soap', 'opera', 'one', 'subject', 'matter', 'oddly', 'un-sexy.Director', 'McGuigan', 'fair', 'job', 'translating', 'French', 'film', 'American', 'remake', 'flashy', 'jumpy', 'quality', 'viewer', 'edge', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'film', 'favor', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'fine', 'performance', 'Matthew', 'film', 'hero', 'lot', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'back', 'heyday', 'arguably', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'long-lost', 'lover', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'attractive', 'there', 'be', 'something', 'missing', 'Lisa', 'not', 'interesting', 'hard', 'believe', 'much', 'Matthew', 'Much', 'better', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'secretive', 'Alex', 'coincidence', 'shares', 'same', 'name', 'femme', 'fatale', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'played', 'Byrne', 'Alex', 'hot', 'cold', 'dynamic', 'mystery', 'woman', 'playing', 'dangerous', 'game', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'Luke', 'believable', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'much', 'variation', 'performances', 'maybe', 'more', 'do', 'kind', 'roles', 'getting.While', 'out', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'Wicker', 'Park', 'too', 'convoluted', 'contrived', 'maintain', 'initial', 'momentum']",Wicker Park

Davidson,"[2, 2]","This is what happens when emo kids grow up to be filmmakers.... well, french film RE-makers to be more exact...This kaleidoscopic montage of creepy people doing creepy things and basically calling the proverbial kettle black trips and skips over itself and generally comes across as a pretentious experiment in transitional fades and blurry color techniques. It just may be a 115 minute indie rock music video. But by george if I didn't like it. The previews would have you believe it is a thriller, but its really more of a glorified chick flick. And still, I liked it. The soundtrack really helped this film along with cuts by The Postal Service, The Shins, and Death Cab For Cutie (to name a few) providing the haunting emotions behind every scene.Though I've seen Josh Hartnett better, (he was amazing in ""O"") he wasn't too bad. Rose Byrne, who plays Lisa 2, was fantastic as the lovesick ""psycho"". I really look forward to seeing more of her. It was also nice to see Jessica Pare, who plays Rebecca, in another film. (She and her castmates from Lost & Delirious seem to be doing very well.) The big surprise for me was Matthew Lillard who plays Hartnett's best friend. I hate Matthew Lillard. But his work in this movie completely won me over. He's great. (Be sure to watch the deleted scenes.)Though a lot of the story turns were obvious, it definitely kept me engaged and tore at my heart. Though the editing was a little flashy, I really enjoyed the direction they took. Merging scenes, mixing up time, camera angles, and using reflections and glass to break up the scenes added to the message of ""nothing is at it seems"". The whole movie is basically told in the first  one minute of the film (particulalry in the extended version) and I knew it right then, but it didn't subtract from my enjoyment of the work at all. A scene I loved in particular was where Byrne's character is applying makeup and they play it in reverse- a very simple but effective tool.The story almost compliments itself on its cleverness and is sure to point out all of the symbolism- in case you were too busy watching all the pretty colors to notice- but its a solid look at that fine line between romance and stalking portrayed in an adult and attractive manner.Overall, I really liked watching this film and I love listening to the soundtrack. But all of the characters are really creepy- the men AND the women. And if you don't see that, then... well......yikes.EDIT: Its been a day and I don't know if its the soundtrack or what but I'm still thinking about this movie and I want to watch it again.",4,Delusions of grandeur...,1107302400,"02 2, 2005",2005,2587,"['what', 'when', 'emo', 'kids', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'filmmakers', 'well', 'french', 'film', 'RE-makers', 'be', 'more', 'exact', 'kaleidoscopic', 'montage', 'creepy', 'people', 'doing', 'creepy', 'things', 'basically', 'calling', 'proverbial', 'kettle', 'black', 'trips', 'skips', 'generally', 'across', 'pretentious', 'experiment', 'transitional', 'fades', 'blurry', 'color', 'techniques', 'just', 'may', 'be', '115', 'minute', 'indie', 'rock', 'music', 'video', 'george', 'did', ""n't"", 'previews', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'thriller', 'really', 'more', 'glorified', 'chick', 'flick', 'still', 'liked', 'soundtrack', 'really', 'helped', 'film', 'cuts', 'Postal', 'Service', 'Shins', 'Death', 'Cab', 'Cutie', 'name', 'few', 'providing', 'haunting', 'emotions', 'scene.Though', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'better', 'was', 'amazing', 'O', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'who', 'Lisa', '2', 'was', 'fantastic', 'lovesick', 'psycho', 'really', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'more', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'Jessica', 'Pare', 'who', 'Rebecca', 'film', 'castmates', 'Lost', 'Delirious', 'seem', 'be', 'doing', 'very', 'well', 'big', 'surprise', 'was', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'who', 'Hartnett', 'best', 'friend', 'hate', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'work', 'movie', 'completely', 'won', 'over', 'great', 'Be', 'sure', 'watch', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'lot', 'story', 'turns', 'were', 'obvious', 'definitely', 'kept', 'engaged', 'tore', 'heart', 'editing', 'was', 'little', 'flashy', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'direction', 'took', 'Merging', 'scenes', 'mixing', 'up', 'time', 'camera', 'angles', 'using', 'reflections', 'glass', 'break', 'up', 'scenes', 'added', 'message', 'nothing', 'whole', 'movie', 'basically', 'told', 'first', 'one', 'minute', 'film', 'particulalry', 'extended', 'version', 'knew', 'right', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'subtract', 'enjoyment', 'work', 'A', 'scene', 'loved', 'particular', 'was', 'where', 'Byrne', 'character', 'applying', 'makeup', 'play', 'reverse-', 'very', 'simple', 'effective', 'tool.The', 'story', 'almost', 'compliments', 'cleverness', 'sure', 'point', 'out', 'symbolism-', 'case', 'were', 'too', 'busy', 'watching', 'pretty', 'colors', 'notice-', 'solid', 'look', 'fine', 'line', 'romance', 'stalking', 'portrayed', 'adult', 'attractive', 'manner.Overall', 'really', 'liked', 'watching', 'film', 'love', 'listening', 'soundtrack', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'creepy-', 'men', 'women', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'then', 'well', 'yikes.EDIT', 'been', 'day', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'soundtrack', 'what', ""'m"", 'still', 'thinking', 'movie', 'want', 'watch', 'again']",Wicker Park

862374,A1BFO0O2FT0O3T,B00067BBMS,"Chancie ""Chance""","[1, 3]","""Wicker Park"" doesn't have a totally original plot. In fact, you could easily compare it to ""Single White Female."" What is original, however, is how it's done.Main character Matthew's girlfriend disappears one day without a word, a phone call, a note, etc. She's just gone. And the only other option he has is to move on with his life, still haunted by the fact that the woman he was madly in love with just vanished.The movie begins about two years later from that event, and he has a fiance, a great job, and everything's going perfect for him. Until he gets a little glimpse of a girl that he believes to be Lisa, the girlfriend who disappeared.Now, this review is going to include only slight spoilers, but nothing that will be bad enough to ruin any aspect of the movie for you.From this little moment, Matthew drops everything to search for Lisa. He lies to his fiance, he cancels a business trip, and he begins a mad hunt to find her, which actually makes him seem more desperate and stalker-like than starstruck. To the point that he uses an apartment key she accidentally left behind to break into her apartment and then fall asleep on her bed.I would not call him romantic. I would call him a creeper.In any case, he eventually discovers that the girl he's been trailing is actually the wrong Lisa. Or ""Lisa."" And so begins the ""Single White Female"" aspect as she develops an obsession for him while he still obsesses over the real Lisa.Anyways, moving away from the plot itself, it's a good movie. Not the best, but still pretty good. It's the kind of movie that will make your head spin from all of the details and the way that every little piece of the movie connects. It's not a movie you can pick up at in the middle, and go from there. You need to see it beginning to end.Now, I can't call it a suspense movie, because there really aren't any times where you can put the pieces together yourself. The movie doesn't give you enough clues. You're forced to sit there and think ""what the heck's going on with this plot?"" for almost the entire time. So, if you're looking for the kind of suspense that keeps you thinking, you won't find it here. However, the story is still thrilling to watch as it unravels and shows what's really going on.The story itself is a little bit unrealistic, but overall, it's pretty well done. The acting and actors are good. The story's decent. And the ending is, well, satisfying. Oh, and the music is pretty good too. Despite it being an almost two hour movie, it doesn't feel that long and it doesn't feel too drawn out. The pace is perfectly set.Many reviews mention that the flash backs are a little hard to follow apart from the main story. I will admit that maybe the first one or two throw you for a loop, as there's really no introduction that implies it's from the past.

This film isn't the least bit thrilling or mysterious.  You pretty much understand what's going on right away and just have to sit back and wait for the rest of the world to figure it out.  Josh Hartnett does pull this off though, and even if you don't think he'd make a great investment banker you can't deny he has acting skills.  He has a lot of warmth in just his eyes alone and is able to convey feelings without opening his mouth.  I feel one day he'll really break out (`Oscar attention' break out) if given the perfect role.Hartnett plays Matthew, a man who is still devastated by the one that got away.  That 'one' was Lisa (Diane Kruger in a surprisingly strong...compared to her `Troy' fiasco...performance), a young dancer who captured Matthews heart only to disappear without a word and leave Matthew lost and depressed.  Time has passed, and although Matthew has moved on (he's now engaged) he hasn't forgotten Lisa, and when she mysteriously appears he becomes frantic to find her and reunite.  Rose Byrne and Matthew Lillard co-star as Alex, the mysterious girl who may or may not have had something to do with Lisa's disappearance, and Luke, Matthews's best friend.  The stand out here is Byrne who plays psycho pretty convincingly.My only regret is the studios decision to market this as a thriller a'la 'Fatal Attraction' but they failed to deliver, and the false pretence that anything here would be remotely steamy is also a let down.  Even with a PG-13 in tact they could have upt the ante with some passion and intensity.

862378,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B00067BBMS,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[6, 9]","Despite it's high profile cast (including Josh Hartnett and Matt Lillard) this movie `Wicker Park' feels like an independent movie with its rather quirky yet intelligent storyline, clever use of flashbacks and off-the-wall cinematography.Perhaps much of that is related to its source material (a French movie). But whatever the reason - I felt myself drawn into this world as a man (Hartnett) throws his career and impending wedding to the wind in an obsessive search for a woman who walked out on him two years earlier.For anyone who has loved and lost, this movie will strike a chord with you, certainly the girls who watched this movie with me loved it and were left sitting on the edge of their seats as it drew to a close. The acting is simply superb and even Hartnett (who has less than impressed me previously) turns in a convincing performance as a man who seems to awaken out of a trance following a fateful walk to the house telephone at a restaurant.The movie opens with Hartnett engaged to Rebecca and meeting with his future brother-in-law at a restaurant to conclude details on a merger between his company and a Chinese company. But, as he waits for the house phone to become available he overhears the voice of his former lover who disappeared two years previously and the race is on to find her.With much of the movie told in flashbacks we learn the details of what happened in the past and are kept two steps ahead of the Hartnett character, who finds another woman in the girls apartment, a friend who is lying to him about an affair with a woman and all manner of machinations that leads him to question his own senses and judgement.With a very satisfying explanation and some wonderful performances this movie surprisingly delivers. I usually am not a person drawn to independent-type movies but this one is a hit with me.This DVD is a little short on extras. There are some deleted scenes that offer nothing new, a rather lame and uninteresting audio commentary and a selection of trailers. Perhaps the best special feature (and certainly the only one I enjoyed) is a gag reel, but its all too short.An interesting, thoughtful romantic drama of a movie, this one is worth a look.",4,"A good, thoughtful movie",1104105600,"12 27, 2004",2004,2201,"['high', 'profile', 'cast', 'including', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'Matt', 'Lillard', 'movie', 'Wicker', 'Park', 'feels', 'independent', 'movie', 'rather', 'quirky', 'yet', 'intelligent', 'storyline', 'clever', 'use', 'flashbacks', 'off-the-wall', 'cinematography.Perhaps', 'much', 'related', 'source', 'material', 'French', 'movie', 'whatever', 'reason', 'felt', 'drawn', 'world', 'man', 'Hartnett', 'career', 'impending', 'wedding', 'wind', 'obsessive', 'search', 'woman', 'who', 'walked', 'out', 'two', 'years', 'earlier.For', 'anyone', 'who', 'loved', 'lost', 'movie', 'will', 'strike', 'chord', 'certainly', 'girls', 'who', 'watched', 'movie', 'loved', 'were', 'left', 'sitting', 'edge', 'seats', 'drew', 'close', 'acting', 'simply', 'superb', 'even', 'Hartnett', 'who', 'less', 'impressed', 'previously', 'convincing', 'performance', 'man', 'who', 'awaken', 'out', 'trance', 'following', 'fateful', 'walk', 'house', 'telephone', 'restaurant.The', 'movie', 'Hartnett', 'engaged', 'Rebecca', 'meeting', 'future', 'brother-in-law', 'restaurant', 'conclude', 'details', 'merger', 'company', 'Chinese', 'company', 'house', 'phone', 'become', 'available', 'voice', 'former', 'lover', 'who', 'disappeared', 'two', 'years', 'previously', 'race', 'find', 'her.With', 'much', 'movie', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'learn', 'details', 'what', 'happened', 'past', 'are', 'kept', 'two', 'steps', 'ahead', 'Hartnett', 'character', 'who', 'woman', 'girls', 'apartment', 'friend', 'who', 'lying', 'affair', 'woman', 'manner', 'machinations', 'question', 'own', 'senses', 'judgement.With', 'very', 'satisfying', 'explanation', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'movie', 'surprisingly', 'delivers', 'usually', 'am', 'not', 'person', 'drawn', 'independent-type', 'movies', 'one', 'hit', 'me.This', 'DVD', 'little', 'short', 'extras', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'offer', 'nothing', 'new', 'rather', 'lame', 'uninteresting', 'audio', 'commentary', 'selection', 'trailers', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'special', 'feature', 'certainly', 'only', 'one', 'enjoyed', 'gag', 'reel', 'too', 'short.An', 'interesting', 'thoughtful', 'romantic', 'drama', 'movie', 'one', 'look']",Wicker Park

It centers around the concept of obsession, but not in the way it first appears.  The film has a nice dreamlike quality to it & the subtle soundtrack helps push the story forward.  As it is full of flashbacks by 3 of the characters, it kind of resembles the undoing of an omelet.It is fitting that one of the characters is an actress in a Shakesperian play;  many of Shakespeare's storylines featured motifs of mistaken identity.  So too is the case in this film.  Still, mistaken identity or not, this movie proves that only Josh Hartnett could get away with turning a breaking-and-entering into a sleepover!The acting is of a high caliber;  both Rose Byrne & Diane Kruger are capable actresses (not to mention easy on the eyes!).  Hartnett has once again expanded his range, having acted in everything from a war movie (Black Hawk Down) to a fun & silly Romantic Comedy (40 Days and 40 Nights).  He has done a good job of preventing his career from being typecast.This is a good film that explores how being someone's secret admirer can cross the line into the territory of being a stalker very easily.

""Wicker Park"" is an adaptation of the French film ""L'Appartment,"" but being remade in a Chicago setting doesn't do anything for the plot. If anything, the tepid acting and weird script drag down the worthy original film.A few years ago, Matt (Josh Harnett) was madly in love with Lisa (Diane Kruger), but she vanished mysteriously after not showing up for a meeting with him. Heartbroken, Matt moved from Chicago to NYC. Now he's in another relationship, and is working for his girlfriend's brother. All is well with the world, it seems. But when he stops in Chicago before a business trip, he hears a woman's voice making a phone call -- and becomes convinced that it's Lisa.Desperate to find Lisa again, Matt enlists his smooth-spoken pal Luke (Matthew Lillard) to help him find Lisa again. He has become obsessed with finding the woman he believes is his one true love. But he runs into another woman (Rose Byrne) who is as obsessed with him as he is with Lisa, and who will do anything to make him hers...""Men who stalk are true romantics. Women who stalk are lunatics."" Not a sentiment I have any liking for, but it's at the core of ""Wicker Park."" While pretty to look at, this film expects the audience to see the soap-esque scenario as being a representation of true love and obsession. Instead, it feels stylized to the point of being surreal. In a nutshell: Even strange people don't act the way they do in this film.Paul McGuigan attempts to give this movie a deep, symbolic, artistic feel. Not to mention a soft-edged Tarantino look, with all the flashbacks and the non-linear style. Can he handle it? Not really. More often than not, the movie seems to be getting out of control. Taken purely for visuals, it is a very pretty movie -- lots of beautiful light, shadow, snow and a dreamlike quality.Josh Harnett gives a practiced but not very compelling turn as Matt. Maybe he would have done better had his character not been a stalker -- the scene where he breaks into the hotel room is simply freaky.

After watching the first 20 minutes I found myself bored: ok, Matthew is a young up-and-coming businessman who, on the eve of a business trip overseas, runs into a woman who he thinks is his long-lost love Lisa.  So he cancels his trip and starts hunting for her.  Where is this going?But in the end, I'm so glad I braved on.  The plot thickens and the appearance of a brunette Lisa starts to make things interesting.  Even though Harnett's acting leaves much to be desired, Australian actress Byrne simply gets better and better as the film progresses.  The film does involved quite a number of flashbacks, but, contrary to the Amazon official reviewer's complaint, they are very easy to follow.  The director uses flashes (literally) to let the audience know they are watching a flashback.  Even without these cues, the ""time travel"" is not confusing at all -- and I'm someone who usually loathes flashbacks (or flash-forwards).I have not watched the 1996 French flick of which Wicker Park is a remake (man, can't Hollywood churn out any good originals no more?), so I'm not going to make a comparison of the two.  But Wicker Park stands well on its own.  After Alex's appearance, the plot has enough suspense to make the remainder 90 minutes quite enjoyable.  Ultimately, it's a love story: unwavering love and desperate love, never-ending love and secret love.  If you ever felt a long-lasting crush on someone, this is a great film for you.  Even if you never did, this is still a film worthy of two hours.The only gripes I have of the film are, first, there's no nudity at all (a sexually charged film with no simulated sex?!), and two, I never understood the Daniel character.",4,"Surprisingly good movie, not your average cliched romance",1110844800,"03 15, 2005",2005,1743,"['picked', 'up', 'Wicker', 'Park', 'random', 'local', 'Blockbuster', 'watching', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'found', 'bored', 'ok', 'Matthew', 'young', 'up-and-coming', 'businessman', 'who', 'eve', 'business', 'trip', 'overseas', 'woman', 'who', 'long-lost', 'love', 'Lisa', 'So', 'trip', 'hunting', 'Where', 'going', 'end', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'braved', 'plot', 'thickens', 'appearance', 'brunette', 'Lisa', 'make', 'things', 'interesting', 'Even', 'Harnett', 'acting', 'leaves', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'Australian', 'actress', 'Byrne', 'simply', 'better', 'better', 'film', 'film', 'involved', 'quite', 'number', 'flashbacks', 'contrary', 'Amazon', 'official', 'reviewer', 'complaint', 'are', 'very', 'easy', 'follow', 'director', 'flashes', 'literally', 'let', 'audience', 'know', 'are', 'watching', 'flashback', 'Even', 'cues', 'time', 'travel', 'not', 'confusing', ""'m"", 'someone', 'who', 'usually', 'flashbacks', 'flash-forwards', '.I', 'have', 'not', 'watched', '1996', 'French', 'flick', 'Wicker', 'Park', 'remake', 'man', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Hollywood', 'churn', 'out', 'good', 'originals', 'more', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'make', 'comparison', 'two', 'Wicker', 'Park', 'well', 'own', 'Alex', 'appearance', 'plot', 'enough', 'suspense', 'make', 'remainder', '90', 'minutes', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'Ultimately', 'love', 'story', 'unwavering', 'love', 'desperate', 'love', 'never-ending', 'love', 'secret', 'love', 'ever', 'felt', 'long-lasting', 'crush', 'someone', 'great', 'film', 'Even', 'never', 'did', 'still', 'film', 'worthy', 'two', 'hours.The', 'only', 'gripes', 'have', 'film', 'are', 'first', 'nudity', 'sexually', 'charged', 'film', 'simulated', 'sex', 'two', 'never', 'understood', 'Daniel', 'character']",Wicker Park

Both movies actually begin near the end of the plot, relying on extensive flashbacks. They are really a jumble of out-of-order scenes that are presumably tied up in the end in a sensible way.

I hope people will agree with me when I say that her performance alone makes this movie a must see.Rose is not the only reason this movie is great.  It is a heart-wrenching, tragic love story/mystery brought to life with stunning visual style.  Wicker Park is a moving painting augmented by a poetic story.  It is a tale of a man, Matthew (played by Josh Hartnett) desperately searching for a lost love, Lisa (Diane Kruger). The film is told in a non-linear fashion and key plot points are revealed at precisely the right time to keep the viewer guessing.  This is kind of a spoiler; but the reason his love is lost is because of the manipulative scheming of Alex (Rose Byrne's character).  She falls hopelessly in love with Matthew from afar before he even knows who she is.  Without too much trouble she is able to devise a plan which allows her to break up the lovers and at the same time get close to Matthew.  That's the details of this particular film, but what it boils down to is a classic theme: person A loves person B while person C loves person A.  Unfortunately person A essentially doesn't know that person C exists.  It's a basic story that almost everyone can relate to in some form or another.Okay back to the main subject of my review.  Yes, Josh Hartnett is well cast and Diane Kruger is adequate in her role, but the real star of the show is Rose Byrne.  Her character is not fully revealed until 45 minutes into the film, but from that moment on, you will forever be under her spell.  Rose is perfectly cast.  No one can say as much with just their eyes and facial expressions as Rose Byrne can.  Love, hurt, anger, fear, sadness, remorse, embarrassment, and elation are all easily displayed without so much as a word.  And what a beautiful face it is, her eyes alone make me weak.  Thankfully the filmmakers were aware of this and took full advantage; frequently shooting her in close-up.Rose's character Alex can easily be seen as the villain because she does everything in her power to keep Matthew and Lisa apart.  Just like in real life, however, everything isn't black and white.  ""Love makes you do crazy things,"" as Rose's character declares.  It depends on who you personally identify with.

It also has enough plot holes to drive a Mac truck through. I'd been meaning to watch this for a while, but the sexual explicit looking cover and the blurb, made me think it would be weak-plotted but that certainly wasn't the case. The storyline is composed of flashbacks and that didn't affect my enjoyment of this film, despite its momentary confusion!The beginning didn't satisfy me completely, but I stuck with it. At first glance, it appeared disjointed, vaguely incoherent and kind of hard to follow, but as it went on, it became clear that this might be a film I'd have to maybe watch a second time to appreciate it on the level it actually meant to be appreciated on. This can't be described as a perfect film, but, to anyone who can identify with it will certainly interest you and leave you with a number of angles to view it from.All the cast deliver a great performances. Hartnett is entirely believable as the haunted young man, caught up in a whirlwind of romances that threaten to destroy him, with good support from Matthew Lillard as his snazzy best friend, and Byrne and Kruger providing captivating female parts. Although a romance, it didn't feel soppy, more tense actually (you end up hitting a lot of things while watching), until the final scene-which gives you a real warm fuzzy feeling!In case you want to see the original, reverse to L'Appartement.

The only true bright spot in this movie is Matthew Lillard's acting and character - though Lisa/Alex was also really very good in her part as was the real Lisa. Josh Hartnett is the only actor that probably should have been re cast. He didn't quite have that childlike charisma to carry off this role. In several scenes he was just sort of creepy.The story is told from present to flashbacks to present - not really done coherently. Mostly from Josh H's POV but at the end the audiencce gets a fill in the blank moment with a POV from the person who had ultimately been manipulating events as well as Lisa's.The premise was shaky just because there is an invention called the cell phone (which no 20 something in this day and age is without). Plus - at the end - this really bothered me - NO ONE HAD CALL WAITING during a point where all four of the main characters were trying to call each other. Also - I don't live there - but does Chicago have any season but winter? From watching this movie, I wouldn't think so...Trailers give the impression that this is going to be a psychological thriller - not so.  More of a - will he ever find her? type of film.

862399,A2GAK89B29KSKX,B00067BBMS,"J. Kruppa ""JKruppa""","[8, 12]","I saw ""Wicker Park"" at a preview screening last night and throughout the entire film kept getting the feeling that a better film lay buried somewhere in the slick cinematography, the non-linear structure and the superficial script.  Though I haven't seen it, I suspect that the better film I was detecting is ""L'Appartement,"" the French original upon ""Wicker Park"" is based.Very briefly, Matt (Josh Hartnett) is introduced to us as a successful young ad-man with a promising career and an attractive, doting fiancee.  On the eve of an important business trip to China, he overhears a voice he believes belongs to a woman (Diane Kruger) who mysteriously disappeared from his life two years before.  He is instantly compelled to find her again, disregarding both his job and his fiancee in the process.  His obsession grows as he follows clues that seem to lead him to a dead end, but nothing is as it appears.On the surface, the main problem with Wicker Park seems to be that it can't decide whether to be a suspense film or a romance, and so fails to do either very well.  The real problem, however, is that at no point does the film ever explore what lies beneath its flashy surface.  The romance between the main leads is told in fractured flashback sequences that do nothing to establish geniune chemistry between the characters.  We are never given a sense of what makes the relationship so powerful for these people that it still haunts them two years later (the present-day setting of most of the story).  The consequence: the resolution of the romantic plot seems arbitrary, and not earned (and then there's the matter of using Coldplay's ""The Scientist"" for the film's last scene, a mismatched music cue if I ever heard one).Similarly, director Paul McGuigan and screenwriter Brandon Boyce give us precious little information about what drives the suspense plot other than a few longing looks from the character who engineers it.  Is this what passes for motivation these days?  Presumably, a restaurant scene toward the end of the film, where the plot threads finally all collide, is supposed to explain some of this.  Unfortunately, it's a poorly handled, poorly written scene, though its one virtue is that it doesn't devolve into the predictable full-blown psycho-killer hysteria I was dreadedly anticipating.  (And why do the characters only ever go to this one restaurant?  I've been to Chicago, I know there's more than one place to eat.)There are a number of other problems with ""Wicker Park"" - an unresolved wisp of a subplot that provides an important story point and is then discarded; the clumsy, identical way each flashback is introduced, etc. - that suggests this is the work of filmmakers who are clearly out of their depth.  Greater skill at balancing the story conflicts might have yielded a more satisfying film, so inasmuch as ""Wicker Park"" is a bad movie, it's really more frustrating for being an intriguing idea that is very poorly executed.",1,A mess,1093996800,"09 1, 2004",2004,2972,"['saw', 'Wicker', 'Park', 'preview', 'screening', 'last', 'night', 'entire', 'film', 'kept', 'getting', 'feeling', 'better', 'film', 'lay', 'buried', 'somewhere', 'slick', 'cinematography', 'non-linear', 'structure', 'superficial', 'script', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'suspect', 'better', 'film', 'was', 'detecting', ""L'Appartement"", 'French', 'original', 'Wicker', 'Park', 'based.Very', 'briefly', 'Matt', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'introduced', 'successful', 'young', 'ad-man', 'promising', 'career', 'attractive', 'doting', 'fiancee', 'eve', 'important', 'business', 'trip', 'China', 'voice', 'belongs', 'woman', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'who', 'mysteriously', 'disappeared', 'life', 'two', 'years', 'before', 'instantly', 'compelled', 'find', 'again', 'disregarding', 'job', 'fiancee', 'process', 'obsession', 'clues', 'seem', 'lead', 'dead', 'end', 'nothing', 'surface', 'main', 'problem', 'Wicker', 'Park', 'be', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'be', 'suspense', 'film', 'romance', 'so', 'fails', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'real', 'problem', 'however', 'point', 'film', 'ever', 'explore', 'what', 'beneath', 'flashy', 'surface', 'romance', 'main', 'leads', 'told', 'fractured', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'do', 'nothing', 'establish', 'geniune', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'are', 'never', 'given', 'sense', 'what', 'relationship', 'so', 'powerful', 'people', 'still', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'present-day', 'setting', 'most', 'story', 'consequence', 'resolution', 'romantic', 'plot', 'arbitrary', 'not', 'earned', 'then', 'matter', 'using', 'Coldplay', 'Scientist', 'film', 'last', 'scene', 'mismatched', 'music', 'cue', 'ever', 'heard', 'one', '.Similarly', 'director', 'Paul', 'McGuigan', 'screenwriter', 'Brandon', 'Boyce', 'give', 'precious', 'little', 'information', 'what', 'suspense', 'plot', 'other', 'few', 'longing', 'looks', 'character', 'who', 'what', 'motivation', 'days', 'Presumably', 'restaurant', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'where', 'plot', 'threads', 'finally', 'collide', 'supposed', 'explain', 'Unfortunately', 'poorly', 'handled', 'poorly', 'written', 'scene', 'one', 'virtue', ""n't"", 'devolve', 'predictable', 'full-blown', 'psycho-killer', 'hysteria', 'was', 'dreadedly', 'anticipating', 'why', 'do', 'characters', 'only', 'ever', 'go', 'one', 'restaurant', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Chicago', 'know', 'more', 'one', 'place', 'eat', 'are', 'number', 'other', 'problems', 'Wicker', 'Park', 'unresolved', 'wisp', 'subplot', 'important', 'story', 'point', 'then', 'discarded', 'clumsy', 'identical', 'way', 'flashback', 'introduced', 'etc', 'work', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'are', 'clearly', 'depth', 'Greater', 'skill', 'balancing', 'story', 'conflicts', 'might', 'have', 'yielded', 'more', 'satisfying', 'film', 'so', 'inasmuch', 'Wicker', 'Park', 'bad', 'movie', 'really', 'more', 'frustrating', 'being', 'intriguing', 'idea', 'very', 'poorly', 'executed']",Wicker Park

But when I eventually saw this film it was less like Fatal Attraction and more like an Alfred Hitchcock thriller such as Vertigo. Even though this film was nothing like I expected I still enjoyed it. This is a film about love found, love lost and love found again two years later. The film takes place in the present but we are treated to flashabacks of past events in the characters lives that answer many questions and also scenes that have already happened are shown again but from a different character's perspective. If you pay close attention to some of the scenes you can catch details that are made more clear later in the film. While not one of my favorite actors, I thought Josh Hartnett did a great job in this film and was able to show all of the pain and confusion his character was going through with just his facial expressions. I do realize that the film isn't perfect and has it faults. In fact my main problem with this film is Matthew Lillard as Hartnett's friend. Lillard has spent most of his career playing goofy characters that it is hard taking him seriously in this film.

They meet up and both deeply fall in love, then she disappears without leaving trace.He starts a new life after failing to find Lisa, dates another girl for 2 years, whom is supposed to later get married to him, but however he is still haunted by the memories of Lisa and the question of why she left him.Then one day at a restaurant he spots Lisa very quickly before she leaves. He traces her through the hotel key room she leaves at the restaurant, and starts afterwards throughout the movie following many traces of her until he eventually leads himself to another Lisa, however not the same blonde Lisa he was in love with!In the end we realize that this new Lisa (brunette) faked her identity. Her actually name was Alex. She was deeply in love with Mathew for a long time without him knowing. She fell in love with him at first sight the same way he fell in love with Lisa!In fact, she was Lisa's close friend, but when she discovered her relationship with Mathew, she did all she can to keep them apart, and she succeeded to keep them so for 2 years. Evetually Mathew discovers her lie and finds the Lisa he loves and gets back together with her.Quite mysterious movie and not very easy to follow at first, however excellent story that keeps you thinking while watching the film.This movie for me was mainly about jealousy. How jealousy could hurt others. Alex was jealous because her friend Lisa was deeply in love with Mathew, so she decided to ruin their love. Didn't we see many cases like this in our lives?Also, cheating was a major thing in this movie. Mathew cheats on his fiancee with Lisa (emotionally). He also cheats on Lisa with Alex (physically). Alex cheats on her boy friend with Mathew. The only faithful one was Lisa.

Matthew (Josh Hartnett), a young, handsome, Chicago businessman is scheduled to leave for China on a business trip. While on a business lunch, shortly before his departure, he suddenly hears a voice that brings back memories. He catches a glimpse of the woman speaking and believes her to be  Lisa (Diane Kruger), the woman  whom he passionately loved two years before but who had totally and mysteriously disappeared from his life, seemingly without a trace. As she rushes out of the restaurant, Matthew is unable to catch up with her, as his current girl friend is with him.Still, he is so taken with what he thinks that he has heard and seen that he decides to chuck his trip to China and, instead, search for his heart's desire.  His best friend, Luke (Matthew Lillard), helps him, after Matthew lays it out for him. Meanwhile, Luke is having his own troubles with Alex (Rose Byrne),  his current main squeeze. Matthew's investigative efforts eventually lead him to an apartment that he believes to be Lisa's, only to find another woman there who calls herself Lisa  but who is not the Lisa that he is looking for. To his surprise, this Lisa seems to have the hots for him, and he initially responds accordingly.Nonethelees, he continues the search for his Lisa, and the viewer eventually sees them pass each other, as two ships in the night, so close, yet so far, seemingly kept apart by fate. Will they ever connect, and why have they not managed to find each other before this? These are the questions that the viewer begins to ask, and it is this that is at the crux of the film. There is more than fate at work here. There is an obstacle to their reunion, and what that obstacle is and why will soon become apparent to the viewer.The first half of the movie is told with numerous flashbacks, as the director  weaves in what happened two years before with the current state of affairs (pun intended). Unfortunately, it is done in such a clumsy way as to leave the viewer somewhat confused. The second half of the film is much better, as the flashbacks appear to make more sense and the veil begins to be lifted. The film actually starts to achieve some semblance of coherence and clarity. The eventual interconnection between the characters is interesting, but what the film delivers to the viewer is a far cry from what was promised by the film's trailers.Rose Byrne gives an excellent performance in a role that demands much from her. Matthew Lillard is fun to watch, as always. Josh Hartnett, to my surprise, as I am a fan of his, gives a performance that is almost laughable. I was actually embarrassed for him. Diane Kruger does a credible job with her role.

Carol ""carolcecilia, D.V.""","[1, 2]","""Wicker Park"" was an unworthy remake of the excellent French psychological thriller, ""L'Appartment"" (1995).The crux of what went wrong with ""Wicker Park"" is this - while ""L'Appartment""'s plot was the epitome of a first-class thriller: clever, intricate, unpredicatble and kept you guessing right till the end, the US remake was the exact opposite. ""Wicker Park"" continuously questioned viewers' ability to decipher the labyrinth of deceit and inexplicable occurences, resulting in its spelling out every nuance every step of the way.For those who have seen and loved the original French flick, it's a no-brainer that the casting was all that much stronger, from Vincent Cassel's lovesick, dazed and confused persona vis-a-vis Josh Hartnett's lost-in-space act, to the dazzlingly mesmerising performance by la belle Monica Bellucci against Diane Kruger, albeit the German model-turned-actress was a beautiful sight to behold and in that regard rightly cast for the role of femme fatale Lisa. (Digressing but some movie trivia here - ""L'Appartment"" actually helped launch Bellucci's career, at the time when she was still a relatively unknown Italian model-turned-actress playing no more than bit parts in Italian films. In her US movie debut, she starred as Dracula's delicious-looking vampire conquest in Francis Ford Coppola's ""Bram's Stoker Dracula"" (1992)). What's worth mentioning was Cassel and Bellucci's sizzling on-screen chemistry and compatibility (which resulted in their off-screen romance and eventual marriage), a stark contrast to the outright mismatch in tying up Hartnett's boyish charm with Kruger's aloof sophistication.  To be fair, Rose Byrne's performance, as the wilfully deceitful woman whom everyone loved to hate for devising the abominable plan in stifling Matt's and Lisa's budding romance, was on a par with Romane Bohringer's pathetic verging on psychotic depiction of Alex the 'single white female' neighbour in the French original.Finally, while ""Wicker Park"" failed to re-enact/mimic/emulate the suspense and ingenuity of ""L'Appartement"" in more ways than one, if we were to judge the US remake purely from the romantic genre's standpoint, it would fare more acceptably, as it proffered the perfect Hollywood ending where the protagonists, in the fashion of Tom and Meg in ""Sleepness in Seattle"" and ""You've Got Mail"", rose above all obstacles to be reunited at the end of the movie. I shan't reveal too much here for those wishing to check out the stylish French version, but suffice it to say the US remake did add value by taking a very different spin on its concluding remarks, something that, for better or worse, gratified and appealed to the optimists in us.",2,Many Cuts Below L'Appartement,1108771200,"02 19, 2005",2005,2698,"['Wicker', 'Park', 'was', 'unworthy', 'remake', 'excellent', 'French', 'psychological', 'thriller', ""L'Appartment"", '1995', '.The', 'crux', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'Wicker', 'Park', ""L'Appartment"", 'plot', 'was', 'epitome', 'first-class', 'thriller', 'clever', 'intricate', 'unpredicatble', 'kept', 'guessing', 'right', 'till', 'end', 'US', 'remake', 'was', 'exact', 'opposite', 'Wicker', 'Park', 'continuously', 'questioned', 'viewers', 'ability', 'decipher', 'labyrinth', 'deceit', 'inexplicable', 'occurences', 'resulting', 'spelling', 'out', 'nuance', 'step', 'way.For', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'loved', 'original', 'French', 'flick', 'no-brainer', 'casting', 'was', 'much', 'stronger', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'lovesick', 'dazed', 'confused', 'persona', 'vis-a-vis', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'lost-in-space', 'act', 'dazzlingly', 'mesmerising', 'performance', 'la', 'belle', 'Monica', 'Bellucci', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'German', 'model-turned-actress', 'was', 'beautiful', 'sight', 'behold', 'regard', 'rightly', 'cast', 'role', 'femme', 'fatale', 'Lisa', 'Digressing', 'movie', 'trivia', 'here', ""L'Appartment"", 'actually', 'helped', 'launch', 'Bellucci', 'career', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'Italian', 'model-turned-actress', 'playing', 'more', 'bit', 'parts', 'Italian', 'films', 'US', 'movie', 'debut', 'starred', 'Dracula', 'delicious-looking', 'vampire', 'conquest', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'Bram', 'Stoker', 'Dracula', '1992', 'What', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'was', 'Cassel', 'Bellucci', 'sizzling', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'compatibility', 'resulted', 'off-screen', 'romance', 'eventual', 'marriage', 'stark', 'contrast', 'outright', 'mismatch', 'tying', 'up', 'Hartnett', 'boyish', 'charm', 'Kruger', 'aloof', 'sophistication', 'be', 'fair', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'performance', 'wilfully', 'deceitful', 'woman', 'whom', 'everyone', 'loved', 'hate', 'devising', 'abominable', 'plan', 'stifling', 'Matt', 'Lisa', 'budding', 'romance', 'was', 'par', 'Romane', 'Bohringer', 'pathetic', 'verging', 'psychotic', 'depiction', 'Alex', ""'single"", 'white', 'female', 'neighbour', 'French', 'original.Finally', 'Wicker', 'Park', 'failed', 're-enact/mimic/emulate', 'suspense', 'ingenuity', ""L'Appartement"", 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'were', 'judge', 'US', 'remake', 'purely', 'romantic', 'genre', 'standpoint', 'would', 'fare', 'more', 'acceptably', 'proffered', 'perfect', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'where', 'protagonists', 'fashion', 'Tom', 'Meg', 'Sleepness', 'Seattle', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Mail', 'rose', 'obstacles', 'be', 'reunited', 'end', 'movie', 'sha', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'too', 'much', 'here', 'wishing', 'check', 'out', 'stylish', 'French', 'version', 'say', 'US', 'remake', 'did', 'add', 'value', 'taking', 'very', 'different', 'spin', 'concluding', 'remarks', 'something', 'better', 'worse', 'gratified', 'appealed', 'optimists']",Wicker Park

When he finally reaches the end of the trail the girl he does find, Lisa/Alex, played by Rose Byrne. Obviously not his Lisa.

Rest assured, this movie is not a thriller at all.  It's a story of lost and obsessive love, and it has some good performances, but after watching it, I somehow felt cheated.  Josh Hartnett plays a young up and coming exec who is about to get engaged to a society-climbing sweetie.  In a restaurant, he overhears a conversation that makes him think his ex-love who left him two years earlier is back in town and he becomes obsessed in finding her.  Diane Krueger is lovely as Lisa, the girl he lost, but Rose Byrne as Alex comes out the focal female character and her performance is rich in its self-centered obsessive love for a man she shouldn't have.  Matthew Lillard as Josh's buddy is effective.  The movie uses flashbacks to show us what is really going on, but an astute viewer should see the ""twists"" coming.  The script also injects a possessive lover in Lisa's new life, but then drops him like they changed their mind.

All during the movie, I was thinking to myself, ""This is really dragging...."" But when it was all over, I kind of liked the entire story all put together.Personally, the acting in this movie was poor, in my opinion... was a bit disappointed with the cinematography too... and I'm pretty sure there's a few places where there are plot holes pretty large... The flashbacks became confusing, with the first part of the movie making the transition from present to past pretty clear, but the line between the two became a lot less clear toward the end of the movie. Character development was a bit weak too, and I found that all three of the major players, and the one minor player in the movie occasionally slipped out of their personas and did things out of character.All that being said - the story itself is kind of sad, kind of sweet, and a bit scary, when you really think of how sometimes what might appear to be fate may really be someone else controlling what is happening in your life and you never know it.I think our 'Alex/Lisa' character got off a bit too easy after all she had done, and the ending was a bit too pat for me, but then again, we are seeing movies after a time period of having unhappy endings be the norm, move back to that 'happily ever after' ending we used to see in movies. This movie does just that - sums it up with a happily ever after that just isn't as realistic to the plot as I would have liked.Yet, with all these negatives, I still find I walked away from this movie satisfied in general with the story, and I have to say, it wasn't a waste of my time... it wouldn't be my first choice, but I feel it is worth watching for those who like a bit is a suspenseful love story.",4,More like a 3 1/2 than a 4...,1163289600,"11 12, 2006",2006,1798,"['walked', 'away', 'movie', 'wondering', 'liked', 'not', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'movie', 'was', 'thinking', 'myself', 'really', 'dragging', 'when', 'was', 'kind', 'liked', 'entire', 'story', 'put', 'together.Personally', 'acting', 'movie', 'was', 'poor', 'opinion', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'cinematography', 'too', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'few', 'places', 'where', 'are', 'plot', 'holes', 'pretty', 'large', 'flashbacks', 'became', 'confusing', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'making', 'transition', 'present', 'past', 'pretty', 'clear', 'line', 'two', 'became', 'lot', 'less', 'clear', 'end', 'movie', 'Character', 'development', 'was', 'bit', 'weak', 'too', 'found', 'three', 'major', 'players', 'one', 'minor', 'player', 'movie', 'occasionally', 'slipped', 'personas', 'did', 'things', 'character.All', 'being', 'said', 'story', 'kind', 'sad', 'kind', 'sweet', 'bit', 'scary', 'when', 'really', 'think', 'how', 'sometimes', 'what', 'might', 'appear', 'be', 'fate', 'may', 'really', 'be', 'someone', 'else', 'controlling', 'what', 'happening', 'life', 'never', 'know', 'it.I', 'think', ""'Alex/Lisa"", 'character', 'got', 'off', 'bit', 'too', 'easy', 'had', 'done', 'ending', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'pat', 'then', 'again', 'are', 'seeing', 'movies', 'time', 'period', 'having', 'unhappy', 'endings', 'be', 'norm', 'move', 'back', ""'happily"", 'ever', 'ending', 'used', 'see', 'movies', 'movie', 'just', 'sums', 'up', 'happily', 'ever', 'just', ""n't"", 'as', 'realistic', 'plot', 'would', 'have', 'liked.Yet', 'negatives', 'still', 'find', 'walked', 'away', 'movie', 'satisfied', 'general', 'story', 'have', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'first', 'choice', 'feel', 'worth', 'watching', 'who', 'like', 'bit', 'suspenseful', 'love', 'story']",Wicker Park

It might be better described as a psychological maze or game of blind tag. Matthew (Josh Hartnett) has returned to Chicago after a  2-year absence, having left the city heartbroken that the woman he loved, Lisa (Diane Kruger), had abandoned him with no explanation. Back in Chicago, just as he prepares to jet off to China on business, Matthew thinks he catches a glimpse of Lisa in a restaurant. Obsessed with finding her, he drops everything and sets off on a relentless search, aided halfheartedly by an old friend, Luke (Matthew Lillard), who has romantic troubles of his own. Matthew's search leads him to an apartment occupied by a woman named Lisa (Rose Byrne), sure enough. She happens to wear the same style coat and shoes as his Lisa, but is an entirely different woman who is interested in Matthew nonetheless.""Wicker Park"" is loosely based on the 1996 French film ""L'Appartement"", and it retains that film's preponderance of flashbacks. Half of the story is told in flashback, as we are being shown two series of events: one that took place 2 years before and one that is contemporary. There is a lot of potential for confusion as the film juggles both identity confusion and temporal uncertainty. But ""Wicker Park"" manages to avoid chaos and present a coherent, if not very affecting, picture of unfulfilled desire. The characters all have their hearts set on being with someone other than the person they have. Everyone loves another, forming a circle of passion and denial. This is intriguing up to a point -the point being when they start playing telephone tag. -Writers and directors take note: this never works as a dramatic device. ""Wicker Park"" toys with being a thriller, but never has enough bite. And it exceeds the quota for coincidences. The film might be an exploration of desire, but most of the characters are too soft around the edges. Rose Byrne's Lisa is the exception. She is the pivot around which the story turns, and Byrne pulls it off. She's intense and vulnerable, crazy and sympathetic, and she should have been more prominent. ""Wicker Park"" isn't bad light entertainment if you don't insist on it having any pay-off. It's just a flat interpretation of interesting ideas.The DVD: Bonus features include an audio commentary by director Paul McGuigan and actor Josh Hartnett, 11 deleted scenes, a short gag reel, a music video for Postal Service's bad rendition of ""Against All Odds"", a photo gallery of on-set photos and publicity stills, a promotional spot for the soundtrack, and a theatrical trailer. In the audio commentary, McGuigan and Hartnett discuss filming in Montreal, Canada. It's sporadically interesting, but the commentary is too laid back to be informative.

862425,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00067BBMS,RMurray847,"[2, 5]","If better actors than Josh Hartnett or Diane Krueger had been cast, WICKER PARK could have been a sleek thriller with lead characters we cared out.  Instead, it's a glossy but fairly lifeless mystery that generates only academic interest.Hartnett plays a young professional who seems to have it made.  He's about to be engaged to a lovely young professional.  He's helped land a major client, is about to globetrot to China in preparation for taking another leap upward in his career.  Yet just as all these pieces are falling into place, he thinks he spies the woman (Diane Krueger) he had a passionate affair with 2 years ago...an affair that ended abruptly with her disappearance.  He literally watched her walk away from him after a conversation in a restaurant and never saw her again.He thinks he's moved on, but in truth, he is compelled to track down this woman who MIGHT be the woman he once loved (and clearly still does).  His quest to track down this woman is interspersed with flashbacks of their relationship, from uncomfortable first meeting to hot, fiery passion to what sure seemed like love to Hartnett, at least.  He follows the trail, and it doesn't quite lead him where he would have hoped.He is assisted by his old friend, woman's shoe store owner Matthew Lillard.  And he is drawn to another woman (Rose Byrne) who seems to somehow figure into all this.The movie is a puzzle to be fitted together.  And the puzzle is mildly, but only academically intriguing.  In order to really care about this piece, we have to really care about the hot, steamy romance between our two leads.  We need to FEEL a desire to see what happened to these people we care about, and we would then feel properly shocked, surprised, dismayed, joyful, etc. at all the events that unfold as Hartnett moves closer to the truth.The basic plot of WICKER PARK is not too bad, but the script is not the best.  It makes the mistake of assuming (as so many movies do) that if we see two attractive people making transcendent love in their chic apartments...we'll fall in love with them ourselves and dote on their every move.  It takes a bit of sparkling dialogue or real chemistry between stars to do that.  The script misses on the dialogue, and the two stars BADLY, REALLY BADLY miss on the chemistry part.  Krueger hasn't really done too much on-screen work in the past, and with her accent, can perhaps be somewhat forgiven for coming across as a pretty airhead.  Hartnett, however, is a more complex problem.  For me, I am hard-pressed to think of a ""star"" in recent years who is less capable of acting.  I guess ""the chicks dig him"" or something, because he kept landing big parts in PEARL HARBOR, 40 DAYS AND NIGHTS, LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN, HOLLYWOOD HOMICIDE and this clunker.  And in not one of those films was he even remotely convincing.  In WICKER PARK, he's asked to smolder and look sad.  His smolder makes him just look vaguely dim-witted and his sad makes him look like a 6 year old crying over a spanking from Mommy.  He's truly, thoroughly dreadful, and utterly lacking in charisma.  There are a number of ""stars"" who can't act very well (Dwayne Johnson springs immediately to mind)  but they have charisma to burn.  Hartnett is in the same category as Hayden Christiansen and Jessica Alba...singularly  unable to be a human being an audience can care about.Matthew Lillard is not a great actor either, but he at least musters ups energy and is mildly sympathetic.  Rose Byrne is a dour creature...but at least something seems to be going on behind her eyes.  I like her better in stuff like ""Damages"" where her slow burn has time to work.  I wouldn't say she  ""succeeds"" in WICKER PARK, but it is only as her character develops that any real interest in the film kicks in.In the end, WICKER PARK aspires to be a mystery romance or perhaps a love-story / thriller.  It neither thrills nor inspires romantic feelings.  However, it does add another page to the ""why Josh Hartnett"" mystery.I would avoid this PG-13 movie at almost all costs.",2,Two really badly cast stars ruin any chance this film had.,1245974400,"06 26, 2009",2009,4043,"['better', 'actors', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'Diane', 'Krueger', 'had', 'been', 'cast', 'WICKER', 'PARK', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'sleek', 'thriller', 'lead', 'characters', 'cared', 'out', 'Instead', 'glossy', 'fairly', 'lifeless', 'mystery', 'only', 'academic', 'interest.Hartnett', 'young', 'professional', 'who', 'have', 'made', 'be', 'engaged', 'lovely', 'young', 'professional', 'helped', 'land', 'major', 'client', 'globetrot', 'China', 'preparation', 'taking', 'leap', 'upward', 'career', 'Yet', 'just', 'pieces', 'are', 'falling', 'place', 'woman', 'Diane', 'Krueger', 'had', 'passionate', 'affair', '2', 'years', 'ago', 'affair', 'ended', 'abruptly', 'disappearance', 'literally', 'watched', 'walk', 'away', 'conversation', 'restaurant', 'never', 'saw', 'again.He', 'moved', 'truth', 'compelled', 'track', 'down', 'woman', 'who', 'MIGHT', 'be', 'woman', 'once', 'loved', 'clearly', 'still', 'quest', 'track', 'down', 'woman', 'interspersed', 'flashbacks', 'relationship', 'uncomfortable', 'first', 'meeting', 'hot', 'fiery', 'passion', 'what', 'sure', 'seemed', 'like', 'love', 'Hartnett', 'least', 'trail', ""n't"", 'quite', 'lead', 'where', 'would', 'have', 'hoped.He', 'assisted', 'old', 'friend', 'woman', 'shoe', 'store', 'owner', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'drawn', 'woman', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'who', 'somehow', 'figure', 'this.The', 'movie', 'puzzle', 'be', 'fitted', 'together', 'puzzle', 'mildly', 'only', 'academically', 'intriguing', 'order', 'really', 'care', 'piece', 'have', 'really', 'care', 'hot', 'steamy', 'romance', 'two', 'leads', 'need', 'FEEL', 'desire', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'people', 'care', 'would', 'then', 'feel', 'properly', 'shocked', 'surprised', 'dismayed', 'joyful', 'etc', 'events', 'unfold', 'Hartnett', 'closer', 'truth.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'WICKER', 'PARK', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'script', 'not', 'best', 'mistake', 'assuming', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'do', 'see', 'two', 'attractive', 'people', 'making', 'transcendent', 'love', 'chic', 'apartments', ""'ll"", 'fall', 'love', 'dote', 'move', 'bit', 'sparkling', 'dialogue', 'real', 'chemistry', 'stars', 'do', 'script', 'dialogue', 'two', 'stars', 'BADLY', 'REALLY', 'BADLY', 'miss', 'chemistry', 'part', 'Krueger', ""n't"", 'really', 'done', 'too', 'much', 'on-screen', 'work', 'past', 'accent', 'can', 'perhaps', 'be', 'somewhat', 'forgiven', 'coming', 'pretty', 'airhead', 'Hartnett', 'however', 'more', 'complex', 'problem', 'am', 'hard-pressed', 'think', 'star', 'recent', 'years', 'who', 'less', 'capable', 'acting', 'guess', 'chicks', 'dig', 'something', 'kept', 'landing', 'big', 'parts', 'PEARL', 'HARBOR', '40', 'DAYS', 'AND', 'NIGHTS', 'LUCKY', 'NUMBER', 'SLEVIN', 'HOLLYWOOD', 'HOMICIDE', 'clunker', 'not', 'one', 'films', 'was', 'even', 'remotely', 'convincing', 'WICKER', 'PARK', 'asked', 'smolder', 'look', 'sad', 'smolder', 'just', 'look', 'vaguely', 'dim-witted', 'sad', 'look', '6', 'year', 'old', 'crying', 'spanking', 'Mommy', 'truly', 'thoroughly', 'dreadful', 'utterly', 'lacking', 'charisma', 'are', 'number', 'stars', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'very', 'well', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'springs', 'immediately', 'mind', 'have', 'charisma', 'burn', 'Hartnett', 'same', 'category', 'Hayden', 'Christiansen', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'singularly', 'unable', 'be', 'human', 'being', 'audience', 'can', 'care', 'about.Matthew', 'Lillard', 'not', 'great', 'actor', 'least', 'musters', 'ups', 'energy', 'mildly', 'sympathetic', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'dour', 'creature', 'least', 'something', 'be', 'going', 'eyes', 'better', 'stuff', 'Damages', 'where', 'slow', 'burn', 'time', 'work', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'WICKER', 'PARK', 'only', 'character', 'real', 'interest', 'film', 'kicks', 'in.In', 'end', 'WICKER', 'PARK', 'be', 'mystery', 'romance', 'perhaps', 'love-story', '/', 'thriller', 'thrills', 'inspires', 'romantic', 'feelings', 'However', 'add', 'page', 'why', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'mystery.I', 'would', 'avoid', 'PG-13', 'movie', 'almost', 'costs']",Wicker Park
862426,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00067BBMS,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 2]","Wicker Park (Paul McGuigan, 2004)McGuigan (Gangster No. 1) takes Gilles Mimouni's script for L'Appartement and modifies it for an American audience, coming up with a confusing mess in the process. Josh Hartnett (Pearl Harbor) plays Matt, a photographer who blows off a trip to China to seal the deal on a major account (for what, exactly, is never stated) in order to pursue a woman who disappeared from his life two years ago, Lisa (the gorgeous Diane Kruger, recently seen in National Treasure). This despite him having a fiancee, Rebecca (Jessica Pare; I've no idea if she's any relation to Michael Pare), who happens to be the brother of a bigwig at the company. Oh, well, blowing off the trip to China probably cost him his job anyway. Also involved in all this is Luke (Matthew ""Shaggy"" Lillard), an old friend of Matt's who he ran into by chance a few days previous, and Luke's mysterious girlfriend Alex (Rose Byrne, recently in I Capture the Castle), along with a woman Matt finds while tracking Lisa down.It actually all makes for a great story, and done properly, it could have been quite a good thriller. However, ""properly"" is not the correct word for this. It's got the same disappointment factor as Christopher Nolan's recent and similarly painful take on Erik Skjoldbaerg's brilliant film Insomnia, and comes with the same recommendation: just rent the original instead. The remake is not worth your time.The one thing about the movie that makes it worth watching is that it's one of those few moments where we find out Matthew Lillard really can act. This may be the most low-key role he's ever played, and he pulls it off wonderfully; easy the best role I've seen him in since The Curve. Lillard, while no one is looking, is liable to develop into a truly fantastic actor. If you're a fan, this movie is a must-see; for everyone else, don't bother. **",2,Another unnecessary remake.,1107129600,"01 31, 2005",2005,1869,"['Wicker', 'Park', 'Paul', 'McGuigan', '2004', 'McGuigan', 'Gangster', 'No', '1', 'Gilles', 'Mimouni', 'script', ""L'Appartement"", 'American', 'audience', 'coming', 'up', 'confusing', 'mess', 'process', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'Matt', 'photographer', 'who', 'off', 'trip', 'China', 'seal', 'deal', 'major', 'account', 'what', 'exactly', 'never', 'stated', 'order', 'pursue', 'woman', 'who', 'disappeared', 'life', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'Lisa', 'gorgeous', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'recently', 'seen', 'National', 'Treasure', 'having', 'fiancee', 'Rebecca', 'Jessica', 'Pare', ""'ve"", 'idea', 'relation', 'Michael', 'Pare', 'who', 'be', 'brother', 'bigwig', 'company', 'Oh', 'well', 'blowing', 'off', 'trip', 'China', 'probably', 'cost', 'job', 'anyway', 'Also', 'involved', 'Luke', 'Matthew', 'Shaggy', 'Lillard', 'old', 'friend', 'Matt', 'who', 'ran', 'chance', 'few', 'days', 'previous', 'Luke', 'mysterious', 'girlfriend', 'Alex', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'recently', 'Capture', 'Castle', 'woman', 'Matt', 'tracking', 'Lisa', 'down.It', 'actually', 'great', 'story', 'done', 'properly', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'good', 'thriller', 'However', 'properly', 'not', 'correct', 'word', 'got', 'same', 'disappointment', 'factor', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'recent', 'similarly', 'painful', 'take', 'Erik', 'Skjoldbaerg', 'brilliant', 'film', 'Insomnia', 'same', 'recommendation', 'just', 'rent', 'original', 'instead', 'remake', 'not', 'worth', 'time.The', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'one', 'few', 'moments', 'where', 'find', 'out', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'really', 'can', 'act', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'low-key', 'role', 'ever', 'played', 'off', 'wonderfully', 'best', 'role', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Curve', 'Lillard', 'one', 'looking', 'liable', 'develop', 'truly', 'fantastic', 'actor', ""'re"", 'fan', 'movie', 'must-see', 'everyone', 'else', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', '**']",Wicker Park

862429,A1FCWRSICTO2AH,B00067BBMS,S. Harris,"[0, 1]","""Wicker Park"" is pretty bad.  For one thing, it's packaged (""Thriller"") as something it is not.  What it is however, is a romance - and one that pushes all the cheap emotional buttons.  Corporate dreamboat, Matthew (Josh Hartnett), on the eve of his upcoming marriage is preparing, in a restaurant party in Chicago, to go off to China to make money for his company.  But Chicago holds memories, and by being there he's reminded of a  nagging longing for an ex- he dated two years before.  And then, coincidence be damned, he thinks he catches a glimpse of her - Lisa -- as she's leaving.  Could it be?  Lisa?Now, Shakespeare used coincidence, and Thomas Hardy was not above using the lost-letter-at-a-critical-moment device, but ""Wicker Park"" is a virtual litany of missed phone calls, meetings, misunderstandings, and one pathetic Iago of a villainess (Rose Byrne as Alex).  But Byrne can act, and against all odds, she actually lifts this ultimately treacly mess.  (Matthew Lillard as Matt's friend Daniel, is also good.) And Byrne certainly acts circles around the bad Josh Hartnett, who somehow succeeds in maintaining a romantic frown for the entire move.  I guess that counts for something - great face muscles?  But the result is that he looks perpetually like a bruised Bambi. But back to Alex, who, like Iago with a wounded heart, deliberately misleads the lovers, because she has her own flame burning for Matt.  Good acting aside, she is however left with the unfortunate line, ""Love makes you do crazy things"", which is right up there with ""Love Story's"" ""Love means never having to say you're sorry.""  (Well, in fairness, it's probably a wiser statement.)  The love interest in all this, Lisa (""Troy's"" Diane Kruger), really didn't register with me at all - probably because her character never gets any traction due to the excessive use of flashbacks.  Still, much has been said about how Kruger shows more of a pulse in ""Wicker Park,"" than she did in ""Troy.""  I disagree, if for no other reason than that ""Troy's"" a better movie.  In ""Troy"" you have guys with swords and stuff, which is certainly more ""thrilling"" than ""Wicker Park.""  And Kruger's got the face that launched a thousand ships. I saw them.

After it was over, she liked it better than I did.From a marketing perspective, I think the promoters did not want this to come out as a chick flick, and they wanted young men to buy into it, but I think that blurred the movie's appeal and confused its audience.  It would have done much better if it was targeted more directly and squarely at women 18-35.  If you are in this core demographic, you should like this movie.

862432,ADUPP9UM7MPFG,B00067BBMS,sweetheart1883,"[1, 1]","The trailor for ""Wicker Park"" would have you believe that this is a ""Fatal Attraction"" kind of film. A crazy stalker type who is obsessive from afar at first and then takes matters into her own hands, which is partly true of this film minus the intense climaxes, and endlessly deep characters.The audience never really gets a feel for the true Matt (played by heart-throb Josh Hartnett) we don't connect with his background or his personality. The audience is just thrown into the middle of this chronilogically deficient love story, thats why we aren't too concerned with how hurt he is in the numerous scenes where he's left weeping.The direction by Paul McGuigan is confusing and scattered. It didn't seem like he was sure of where he wanted to go with the film as judging by the complete disarray of the scene sequencing. The audience is left in a frustrating state of perplexity thoughout the entire film due to its constant flashbacks. Flashbacks are a technique often used to give background but mostly seen in a different cinematogaphy to differenciate their meaning, i.e. black and white or fast forwarding a narrated scene or slow motion with a previous monologue as used in classics like ""Momento"".The inadequate soundtrack was best fit for a film with more intensity and detracked from what was actually appealing. Finally the only redeeming quality this film possesses is its impeccable choice of casting for the part of Luke, Matt's best friend, played by the always reliable Matthew Lillard, who gave his usual comic relief perfomance and yet captured the audience with his schoolboy charm.",2,What A Tangled Web We Weave,1095206400,"09 15, 2004",2004,1605,"['trailor', 'Wicker', 'Park', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'kind', 'film', 'crazy', 'stalker', 'type', 'who', 'obsessive', 'afar', 'first', 'then', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'partly', 'true', 'film', 'intense', 'climaxes', 'endlessly', 'deep', 'characters.The', 'audience', 'never', 'really', 'feel', 'true', 'Matt', 'played', 'heart-throb', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'do', ""n't"", 'connect', 'background', 'personality', 'audience', 'just', 'thrown', 'middle', 'chronilogically', 'deficient', 'love', 'story', 'thats', 'why', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'concerned', 'how', 'hurt', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'where', 'left', 'weeping.The', 'direction', 'Paul', 'McGuigan', 'confusing', 'scattered', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'was', 'sure', 'where', 'wanted', 'go', 'film', 'judging', 'complete', 'disarray', 'scene', 'sequencing', 'audience', 'left', 'frustrating', 'state', 'perplexity', 'entire', 'film', 'due', 'constant', 'flashbacks', 'Flashbacks', 'are', 'technique', 'often', 'used', 'give', 'background', 'mostly', 'seen', 'different', 'cinematogaphy', 'differenciate', 'meaning', 'i.e', 'black', 'white', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'narrated', 'scene', 'slow', 'motion', 'previous', 'monologue', 'used', 'classics', 'Momento', '.The', 'inadequate', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'best', 'fit', 'film', 'more', 'intensity', 'detracked', 'what', 'was', 'actually', 'appealing', 'Finally', 'only', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'film', 'impeccable', 'choice', 'casting', 'part', 'Luke', 'Matt', 'best', 'friend', 'played', 'always', 'reliable', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'who', 'gave', 'usual', 'comic', 'relief', 'perfomance', 'yet', 'captured', 'audience', 'schoolboy', 'charm']",Wicker Park

862435,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00067BBMS,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 3]","[CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS]  One strange thing is that when I saw the trailer of 'Wicker Park,' I thought this film must be a Hitchcock-like thriller.  Now I saw it, and found it isn't.  It is more like a romance shot with a Brian DePalma touch -- romantic, moody, and very convoluted.  Most likely you don't believe the story, OK, but you are constantly entertained.  Turn a blind eye to unbelievable coincidences and silly decisions that the characters make.This is another (some say, ruined) remake of French film 'L'Appartment' (1996) starring Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel.  The MGM/Lakeshore Entertainment remake, directed by Paul McGuigan ('Gangster No,1'), stars instead Josh Hartnett as Matthew, a successful businessman who is engaged to beautiful Rebecca (Jessica Pare), and is about to travel to China on business.  But at the restroom of a restaurant, he overhears a familiar voice of someone he knew very well, in fact, someone he loved two years ago.She is Lisa (Diane Kruger, 'Troy'), and instead of going to the airport, Matthew tracks down his ex-love to one hotel room.  Then, the flashback sections bring us the romantic events between Lisa and Matthew, seen from his point of view -- how he met her in the snowy city of Chicago, how he talked to her at a shop where Matthew's buddy (Matthew Lillard) works, and how Matthew loved her so passionately.But suddenly Lisa disappeared, abruptly, leaving any trace behind.  And more incredible thing is (to him, and to us all), as Matthew (of the present tense) follows the clues of Lisa's whereabouts, he finds himself in Lisa's room (don't ask me how he get in), finds another girl (Rose Byrne, also 'Troy' as Briseis) who claims she is Lisa.OK, let's stop it, for there are more to come, more to surprise us.  The film is basically a love story seen from more than one perspectives, but director McGuigan uses too many flashbacks explaining the 'truths' which not only mystify our mind, but grab our head, and keep on twisting them.  I eventually understood, and never lost interest in, what really happened to the characters, but still do not know what is the film's point after all, with these jumbled time order and even split screens.  Did we really need these styles to tell this story, especially when this is not a thriller?I was not a little impressed with the acting of the four main cast.  While Josh Hartnett is the weakest link, that is probably his character acts in a very impossible way.  Kruger is much better than in 'Troy' but it is Rose Byrne who is really memorable, pulling off this very demanding role.  And it is time we should give Matthew Lillard a chance to do something different.  He is not bad; it is that he deserves better than playing just another wiseacre buddy who turns out not as wise as the main character.Certainly 'Wicker Park' keeps you guessing, as long as you just stop thinking.  Don't think about why all these characters do not use e-mail when they use cell phones ten times a day.  Don't think about why three (or more, I am afraid) characters leave messages on paper, surely troublesome and unreliable way.  And it is beautifully shot, with the frosty streets and three charming ladies.  Expect that, it is quite empty.",3,Wicker Park Is Moody and Vacant.

862436,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B00067BBMS,Tucker Andersen,"[16, 19]","This film vacillates between romance, mystery and occasional flashes of humor, and the story is accompanied by a varied and sometimes overly loud sountrack. It is simultaneously a story of lost opportunities, the search for closure, and the pursuit of a dream (or is it a romantic obsession?) sequenced in an interesting and clever manner by Director Paul McGuigan. It is almost two hours in length and the storyline takes shape slowly at the beginning, so a theatergoer should be prepared for it to take a while to become involved with the characters and for the pace to accelerate.The movie opens with Matt (Josh Hartnett) rushing to a Chicago restaurant to meet his girlfriend and her family before he is scheduled to leave for Shanghai on a business trip. (He is employed by his girlfriend's brother.)  Luke (Matthew Lillard), an old friend who does not know that Matt has returned to Chicago from living in NYC, spots him on the street as he is about to enter the restaurant and Matt promises that they will get together when he returns from China. While making a visit to the restroom after using the pretext of the need to make a phone call (apparently he doesn't own a cell phone) when the discussion of marriage was brought up, Matt accidentally overhears a phone conversation involving a woman who apparently fears for her safety. Once he concentrates upon the call, he is convinced it is the voice of his former girlfriend Lisa, who mysteriously disappeared overnight two years ago. Her unexplained absence after failing to meet her for a planned rendezvous in WICKER PARK caused the heartbreak which resulted in his decision to move to NYC. The woman rushes from the restaurant before he can confront her, but he finds a hotel key left folded in a newspaper in the phone booth. One of the few predictable moments in the movie occurs when Matt decides he has to attempt to locate the woman and determine if it is indeed Lisa, with whom he is still obsessed.So, Matt's odyssey begins. He enlists Luke's help, who is of course stunned that Matt would postpone his business trip and take the chance of completely ruining his current relationship. However, in a flashback we soon discover that Luke played a significant role in Matt's initial meeting with Lisa (Diane Kruger). Furthermore, the state of Luke's relationship with his girlfriend and budding actress Alex (Rose Byrne) leaves a lot to be desired. The complexity of the interrelationships betwen the characters is gradually revealed, and while the surprise at the center of the story is not as great as that in the SIXTH SENSE, many of the same cinematic techniques of time shifting, misdirection, and well disguised clues are employed. Since I do not want to include any spoilers, I will simply summarize the story by saying that the tension builds gradually as the degree of the manipulation resulting from the romantic obsession of one of the characters is gradually revealed.This is not a film for moviegoers who like linear plot expositions and easily categorizable stories. The element which causes it to rise above the usual mundane two or three star film about a manipulative psycho acting out a romantic fantasy is the structure of the film. The story is told in very nonlinear fashion, with cuts to flashbacks of events two years ago becoming more frequent as the film proceeds. Flashbacks to events that have just transpired are also interspersed, but these are experienced from the point of view of other than the primary narrator Matt. On occasion the technique was disorienting until I became accustomed to it, because the viewer has to figure out when the action is occuring. But if you stay alert, it was a very efective way of illuminating the events involved and adding contex through the rapidly changing perspectives. I definitely would have to watch the film again in order to see how often such juxtapositions could actually be recognized by an alert moviegoer and how many were totally a function of utilizing closeups which obscured the totality of the action. In summary, this is a technically interesting and well acted film telling a moderately interesting. The tension is palpable, because the viewer is never sure until the end whether it is primarily a romance or a psyhological thriller. (I certainly won't tell!) In conclusion, this is a story of both shattered lives and restored dreams.Tucker Andersen",4,O Lisa!  Lisa!

In fact, I didn't expect much from the movie and thought that I wouldn't like it.  The movie sat on my shelf for three weeks before I finally stuck it into the DVD player out of pureboredom.  I won't go into the plot of the movie.  You can get that from many of the other reviews.  WhatI will say is that I found myself hooked about halfway through the film when I began to realize that this was a love story and not a thriller.  Though I'm not a big Josh Harnett fan, he won me over and had me rooting for him during the last third of the movie.  The ending (to my surprise) brought tears to my eyes.  That seldom happens when I watch a movie, unless you count The Notebook, A Message In A Bottle, The Bridges of Madison County, Made In Heaven, and Somewhere In Time.  This is definitely a movie that I want to watch again, which is saying a lot because I see so many movies that do absolutely nothing for me emotionally.  Wicker Park was a most pleasant surprise that tugged at my heart and had me wondering why I couldn't find someone to love as strongly as the character seem to do in this film.  That's the reason I'm giving it 5 Stars.  It accomplished what I think the director set out to do, which was to tell a story about lost love and how everyone can experience it and what we'll do to get it back.",5,One of the best surprises of 2005!!!!,1135814400,"12 29, 2005",2005,1438,"['most', 'other', 'reviewers', 'thought', 'Wicker', 'Park', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'low', 'budget', 'thriller', 'racy', 'sex', 'scenes', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'movie', 'thought', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'sat', 'shelf', 'three', 'weeks', 'finally', 'stuck', 'DVD', 'player', 'pureboredom', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'plot', 'movie', 'can', 'get', 'many', 'other', 'reviews', 'WhatI', 'will', 'say', 'found', 'hooked', 'halfway', 'film', 'when', 'began', 'realize', 'was', 'love', 'story', 'not', 'thriller', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'Josh', 'Harnett', 'fan', 'won', 'had', 'rooting', 'last', 'third', 'movie', 'ending', 'surprise', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes', 'seldom', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'count', 'Notebook', 'A', 'Message', 'A', 'Bottle', 'Bridges', 'Madison', 'County', 'Made', 'Heaven', 'Somewhere', 'Time', 'definitely', 'movie', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'saying', 'lot', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'do', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'emotionally', 'Wicker', 'Park', 'was', 'most', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'tugged', 'heart', 'had', 'wondering', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'someone', 'love', 'as', 'strongly', 'character', 'seem', 'do', 'film', 'reason', ""'m"", 'giving', '5', 'Stars', 'accomplished', 'what', 'think', 'director', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'was', 'tell', 'story', 'lost', 'love', 'how', 'everyone', 'can', 'experience', 'what', ""'ll"", 'do', 'get', 'back']",Wicker Park
