I can't believe there is so much more to his history than I knew, having been a fan since 1983...it was a great time reliving these classic moments. You look at all of the pictures, and here is this huge muscle bound snarling man staring at you; but the video reveals what appears to be a gentle, super nice  smiling rocker. I have a new found respect for this artist after watching this. I give it five starts because it is a real blessing to have this compilation in my hands and I am truly grateful. I just hope there is a part two, as this only covers thru the mid 80's...we need twenty more years exposed!",5,MUSCLE ROCK....YES!!!,1167782400,"01 3, 2007",2007,686,"['Fans', 'Thor', 'HAVE', 'get', 'Wow', 'amount', 'classic', 'clips', 'amazing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'history', 'knew', 'having', 'been', 'fan', '1983', 'was', 'great', 'time', 'reliving', 'classic', 'moments', 'look', 'pictures', 'here', 'huge', 'muscle', 'snarling', 'man', 'staring', 'video', 'what', 'be', 'gentle', 'super', 'nice', 'smiling', 'rocker', 'have', 'new', 'found', 'respect', 'artist', 'watching', 'give', 'five', 'starts', 'real', 'blessing', 'have', 'compilation', 'hands', 'am', 'truly', 'grateful', 'just', 'hope', 'part', 'two', 'only', 'thru', 'mid', '80', 'need', 'twenty', 'more', 'years', 'exposed']",N/A
908485,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B0009N31E0,Kasey G,"[1, 1]","In the mid-'80s, I remember buying the heavy metal magazines (mostly for Motley Crue and Judas Priest) but always remember seeing Thor in them.The Vancouver-born Jon Mikl Thor was a heavy metal showman who was like Alice Cooper on steroids. As a teenager who lifted weights while listening to Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, he also incorporated his childhood interest in comic book superheroes to create his stage persona, The Mighty Thor.Thor was a precursor to the Chippendales and male stripper phenomenon of the '80s.  Even though he wasn't a dancer, the fact that he used his amazing physique as part of the gimmick really paved the way for the idea of beefcake as entertainment for women (and some men). One reporter even named him ""the male Dolly Parton"" obviously referring to his bodacious attributes.While there's no denying much of Thor's appeal was visual, you can see in his performances that he was very earnest in giving the audience the best show he could.Thor began performing during the Glam Rock era of the '70s and his influences were Alice Cooper, David Bowie, Kiss, Lou Reed and even Elvis!Anyone doing a search on Thor already knows that this music isn't exactly the calibre of Alice Cooper, Aerosmith or even Kiss. It is what it is, as the saying goes, but I must say I prefer the Vegas/Glitter style act he was performing in the '70s to the later '80s era where he took the heavy metal persona too seriously.As a video document of Thor's career, you can't get much better than this DVD. There is approximately two hours of material here including all of his music videos (It should be noted that many of these were made Pre-MTV to hopefully gain him publicity), many live performances, and a still gallery that contains nearly 100 rare photos, from childhood pics to candid shots, outtakes from video shoots and LP cover sessions, and shots from early performances. This DVD is worth the price for the still gallery alone!There is the option of watching with a running commentary which is very interesting and informative.The video quality is generally good, and most of the clips are what you would expect from old VHS quality. There are no serious glitches.A great, comprehensive DVD release for fans of Thor!",5,Comprehensive DVD Chronicles THOR's Career,1285545600,"09 27, 2010",2010,2237,"[""mid-'80s"", 'remember', 'buying', 'heavy', 'metal', 'magazines', 'mostly', 'Motley', 'Crue', 'Judas', 'Priest', 'always', 'remember', 'seeing', 'Thor', 'them.The', 'Vancouver-born', 'Jon', 'Mikl', 'Thor', 'was', 'heavy', 'metal', 'showman', 'who', 'was', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'steroids', 'teenager', 'who', 'lifted', 'weights', 'listening', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'Black', 'Sabbath', 'also', 'incorporated', 'childhood', 'interest', 'comic', 'book', 'superheroes', 'create', 'stage', 'persona', 'Mighty', 'Thor.Thor', 'was', 'precursor', 'Chippendales', 'male', 'stripper', 'phenomenon', ""'80s"", 'Even', 'was', ""n't"", 'dancer', 'fact', 'used', 'amazing', 'physique', 'part', 'gimmick', 'really', 'paved', 'way', 'idea', 'beefcake', 'entertainment', 'women', 'men', 'One', 'reporter', 'even', 'named', 'male', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'obviously', 'referring', 'bodacious', 'denying', 'much', 'Thor', 'appeal', 'was', 'visual', 'can', 'see', 'performances', 'was', 'very', 'earnest', 'giving', 'audience', 'best', 'show', 'began', 'performing', 'Glam', 'Rock', 'era', ""'70s"", 'influences', 'were', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'David', 'Bowie', 'Kiss', 'Lou', 'Reed', 'even', 'Elvis', 'Anyone', 'doing', 'search', 'Thor', 'already', 'music', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'calibre', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'Aerosmith', 'even', 'Kiss', 'what', 'saying', 'must', 'say', 'prefer', 'Vegas/Glitter', 'style', 'act', 'was', 'performing', ""'70s"", 'later', 'era', 'where', 'took', 'heavy', 'metal', 'persona', 'too', 'seriously.As', 'video', 'document', 'Thor', 'career', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'better', 'DVD', 'approximately', 'two', 'hours', 'material', 'here', 'including', 'music', 'videos', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'many', 'were', 'made', 'Pre-MTV', 'hopefully', 'gain', 'publicity', 'many', 'live', 'performances', 'still', 'gallery', 'nearly', '100', 'rare', 'photos', 'childhood', 'pics', 'candid', 'shots', 'outtakes', 'video', 'shoots', 'LP', 'cover', 'sessions', 'shots', 'early', 'performances', 'DVD', 'price', 'still', 'gallery', 'alone', 'option', 'watching', 'running', 'commentary', 'very', 'interesting', 'informative.The', 'video', 'quality', 'generally', 'good', 'most', 'clips', 'are', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'old', 'VHS', 'quality', 'are', 'serious', 'glitches.A', 'great', 'comprehensive', 'DVD', 'release', 'fans', 'Thor']",N/A
908486,A2HRVE5MUWP0PN,B0009N31E0,"Ken Pierce ""Editor, PiercingMetal.com""","[5, 6]","Thor is and always was one of the most interesting people in Hard Rock music.  This DVD is a perfect historical document to the first 20 years of Jon Mikl Thor's career and his efforts to defend the music fan from the forces of evil.  It is a battle he has fought well, and you are given the reminder very well in this DVD appropriately titled ""An-Thor-Logy"".  Starting with footage that dates back to 1976, on the Merv Griffin show of all things, we see Thor first as a Las Vegas styled ""strongman entertainer"".  He performs the song ""Action"" by The Sweet, and personally I am not a fan of Sweet covers when I can listen to the real thing.  Thor's voice is also not of the register for such a vocal range.  Despite this, even back then he showcases the hot water bottle inflating he is known for.  After this piece he is more showcased as a rock music performer and how his act began and grew ever more interesting over time.  There are a few more TV appearances to enjoy on this DVD as well and the old school fans will remember them I am sure.This DVD is really a lot of fun because it not only shows you a great historical document on one of the most dedicated forces in Hard Rock, but it really is the only place you will ever get to see a lot of this footage ever again.  It seems to include all of Thor's promotional videos and contains a lot of live footage with a couple of different line-ups playing along with him.  The videos might seem a bit corny by today's standards but for what Thor and his music were about they truly fit in well.  They are actually mini-movies showing Thor fighting demons and defeating his enemy or just simply performance pieces were it is meant to look like this is a live show.  On the concert footage the diehard will be beside themselves for it is a great way to see what Thor was like in the glory days of his performances.  Everything from blowing up the hot water bottle until it bursts, bending the steel bar in his mouth, & shattering the concrete blocks on his chest are there for the non believer to see firsthand.There are also some cool interview pieces for you to enjoy.  Sadly not enough people got to experience the fun that is a Thor show, but this DVD gives the diehards a fine memento and the curious a great place to start. Thor is lucky to have so much footage to choose from that the people at Smog Veil were able to place it into a worthwhile DVD.  This is recommended purely because it was a lot of fun to watch and let the rest of the world be left behind just a little bit.  Enjoy and keep those hammers raised high for the Mighty Thor.",4,Keep Those Hammers Raised!!!!,1125619200,"09 2, 2005",2005,2600,"['Thor', 'always', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'people', 'Hard', 'Rock', 'music', 'DVD', 'perfect', 'historical', 'document', 'first', '20', 'years', 'Jon', 'Mikl', 'Thor', 'career', 'efforts', 'defend', 'music', 'fan', 'forces', 'evil', 'battle', 'fought', 'well', 'are', 'given', 'reminder', 'very', 'well', 'DVD', 'appropriately', 'titled', 'An-Thor-Logy', 'Starting', 'footage', 'back', '1976', 'Merv', 'Griffin', 'show', 'things', 'see', 'Thor', 'first', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'styled', 'strongman', 'entertainer', 'song', 'Action', 'Sweet', 'personally', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'Sweet', 'covers', 'when', 'can', 'listen', 'real', 'thing', 'Thor', 'voice', 'also', 'not', 'register', 'vocal', 'range', 'even', 'back', 'then', 'hot', 'water', 'bottle', 'inflating', 'known', 'piece', 'more', 'showcased', 'rock', 'music', 'performer', 'how', 'act', 'began', 'grew', 'ever', 'more', 'interesting', 'time', 'are', 'few', 'more', 'TV', 'appearances', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'old', 'school', 'fans', 'will', 'remember', 'am', 'sure.This', 'DVD', 'really', 'lot', 'fun', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'historical', 'document', 'one', 'most', 'dedicated', 'forces', 'Hard', 'Rock', 'really', 'only', 'place', 'will', 'ever', 'get', 'see', 'lot', 'footage', 'ever', 'again', 'include', 'Thor', 'promotional', 'videos', 'lot', 'live', 'footage', 'couple', 'different', 'line-ups', 'playing', 'videos', 'might', 'seem', 'bit', 'corny', 'today', 'standards', 'what', 'Thor', 'music', 'were', 'truly', 'fit', 'well', 'are', 'actually', 'mini-movies', 'showing', 'Thor', 'fighting', 'demons', 'defeating', 'enemy', 'just', 'simply', 'performance', 'pieces', 'were', 'meant', 'look', 'live', 'show', 'concert', 'footage', 'diehard', 'will', 'be', 'beside', 'great', 'way', 'see', 'what', 'Thor', 'was', 'glory', 'days', 'performances', 'Everything', 'blowing', 'up', 'hot', 'water', 'bottle', 'bending', 'steel', 'bar', 'mouth', 'shattering', 'concrete', 'blocks', 'chest', 'are', 'there', 'non', 'believer', 'see', 'firsthand.There', 'are', 'also', 'cool', 'interview', 'pieces', 'enjoy', 'Sadly', 'not', 'enough', 'people', 'got', 'experience', 'fun', 'Thor', 'show', 'DVD', 'diehards', 'fine', 'memento', 'curious', 'great', 'place', 'start', 'Thor', 'lucky', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'footage', 'choose', 'people', 'Smog', 'Veil', 'were', 'able', 'place', 'worthwhile', 'DVD', 'recommended', 'purely', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'let', 'rest', 'world', 'be', 'left', 'behind', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'Enjoy', 'keep', 'hammers', 'raised', 'high', 'Mighty', 'Thor']",N/A

A total of twenty-seven songs, commercials and snippets. I definitely got something good out of his 1976 appearance on the Merv Griffin Show where he's playing a cover of the Sweet's ""Action"". Maybe dated, but still holds the test of time. Also like ""Sleeping Giant"" as well as both versions of ""Keep The Dogs Away"" (wasn't that tune on his very first lp?), the heavy-duty rocker ""Anger"", ""Gladiator Stomp"" and ""Knock 'Em Down"" (hadn't heard this tune in ages). Didn't expect the two rarely-seen TV commercials. Everything here on this should-see DVD was recorded from 1976-1985. Ironic, but for as long as I could remember, I've never been able to locate more than another one - maybe even two fellow Thor fans. He was slated to play a dive in my hometown awhile back. But the gig was cancelled - I then later found out they only sold something like four tickets in advance. A true underdog in the heavy metal field.

908488,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,B0009N31E0,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[0, 0]","I've always believed that what the world needs is a career retrospective on ""muscle rocker"" Jon Mikl Thor.  Thankfully Smog Veil records has made this a reality.For those unfamiliar with Thor(if you're reading this you should be, but you never know), he's a bodybuilder from Vancouver who has won many titles, but found his true calling in Rock and Roll.  Taking on the image and persona of the mythical hero/comic character, Thor started making music in the mid seventies, starting out as a glam act, then a hard rock/metal act in the 80s, right up until the present day.  Also incorporated into his act were circus strongman type feats.  He's known for blowing up a hot water bottle til it explodes, bending steel with his teeth and having cinder blocks crushed on his chest.  In the late 70s it looked like Thor might have been destined to be the up and coming big thing in rock, but he never really achieved anything more than cult status.  Even the metal community doesn't really talk about him!  You know he's gotta be corny if the metal community keeps him on the hush hush.  He's probably more famous in Canada, but I'm not sure.The An-THOR-logy DVD isn't a documentary of his career, but rather 90 minutes of archival footage.  It includes his promo videos, many live performances, TV show appearances, old interviews with folks who had seen his live act, television commercials, and the hilarious appearance on the Merv Griffin show(the folks in the audience as well as Merv's band have no idea what to think of this guy!).  Most of it does consist of live performances.  I was only familiar with a handful of songs coz his older albums are quite difficult to come by.  I guess you'd say it's kinda Manowar-ish lyrically and thematically, but musically a lot more basic.  It's also a bit more tongue in cheek.Thor never took himself too seriously and it shows he has a sense of humor by allowing some of this footage out of the bag.  ""Corny"" hardly begins to describe some of his stage antics and poses.  It's really funny stuff, but you might find yourself feeling a bit odd after a half hour or so of watching an oiled up Thor prancing around on stage in his underwear, displaying his finely tuned figure.The DVD only covers up to around 1985, so unfortunately there is no mention or footage from Thor's 1987 schlockfest movie, Rock and Roll Nightmare.  But the bonus features on the Rock and Roll Nightmare DVD are plentiful enough that they aren't really needed on this disc without being redundant.Though he'll never be accused of being a great vocalist, you gotta admit that Thor was(is) one hell of a showman.  Nobody else did stuff like this.  Even though the music isn't all that original or great(the glam stuff is actually pretty cool), Thor obviously puts on one helluva show.  I'd love to see him sometime.If you're curious, check out some of the Thor postings on Youtube like ""Keep The Dogs Away"" and various live performances.  His newer videos are there as well.
