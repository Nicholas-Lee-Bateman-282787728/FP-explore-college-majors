From the scrappy underdog (who you *will* cheer for, if only because the established opposition is so much more odious), whose toddler son can be heard in the background pleading ""Stop playing Donkey Kong!"" so that his father will come help him in the bathroom, and whose daughter offhandedly points out that, you know, some people ruin their entire lives trying to get into the Guinness Book of World Records... to the established top dog, Billy Mitchell, whose every line positively drips with hilarious self-important haughtiness, to the self-appointed guardians of classic game scores... who are so deeply in bed with Billy Mitchell that they will do just about anything to preserve his status as top game scorer.It is an absolute *scream* to see the wild-eyed ""tape reviewer"" who reviews the submission tapes rant on about potential cheaters and how he'll stake his life and honor and whatnot on their reputation... except, of course, when it comes to Billy's tapes which are judged automatically authentic immediately, despite frequent tape skips, distortions, and impurities. Indeed, Billy is so trustworthy, that he's on the committee who decides whether or not the people who send in new scores to beat his old scores can ""truly"" be trusted or not. Of course, he's totally fair... I have to bet that Guinness was SO thrilled when this documentary came out, because they're basically on record as saying that this slip-shod organization's word is good enough for their prestigious publishing, ha.Fans of classic gaming will love this documentary for the fascinating discussions of how and why classic games were as impossibly hard to master as they often were - as well as the interesting programming discussions about the ""kill screen"" when the game code basically just... runs out. Non-gamers will love this documentary for the hilarious personalities on display - really, there's not a single person in this documentary who doesn't take the travails of Donkey Kong (""this machine is *possessed*!"") far, far more seriously than the average viewer will - and the results are nothing short of hilarious.~ Ana Mardoll",4,The people you love to hate...,1256947200,"10 31, 2009",2009,2462,"['Kings', 'Kong', 'Fistful', 'Quarters', '/', 'B000XQ4HR8Every', 'moment', 'documentary', 'pure', 'gold', 'only', 'have', 'love', 'admire', 'amount', 'obliviousness', 'canny', 'sense', 'self-parody', 'would', 'allow', 'participants', 'aid', 'documentary', 'so', 'everyone', 'involved', 'clueless', 'petty', 'childless', 'and/or', 'moronic', 'scrappy', 'underdog', 'who', '*will*', 'cheer', 'only', 'established', 'opposition', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'odious', 'toddler', 'son', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'background', 'pleading', 'Stop', 'playing', 'Donkey', 'Kong', 'father', 'will', 'come', 'help', 'bathroom', 'daughter', 'offhandedly', 'out', 'know', 'people', 'ruin', 'entire', 'lives', 'trying', 'get', 'Guinness', 'Book', 'World', 'Records', 'established', 'top', 'dog', 'Billy', 'Mitchell', 'line', 'positively', 'hilarious', 'self-important', 'haughtiness', 'self-appointed', 'guardians', 'classic', 'game', 'scores', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'deeply', 'bed', 'Billy', 'Mitchell', 'will', 'do', 'just', 'anything', 'preserve', 'status', 'top', 'game', 'scorer.It', 'absolute', '*scream*', 'see', 'wild-eyed', 'tape', 'reviewer', 'who', 'reviews', 'submission', 'rant', 'potential', 'cheaters', 'how', ""'ll"", 'stake', 'life', 'honor', 'whatnot', 'reputation', 'course', 'when', 'Billy', 'tapes', 'are', 'judged', 'automatically', 'authentic', 'immediately', 'frequent', 'tape', 'skips', 'distortions', 'impurities', 'Indeed', 'Billy', 'so', 'trustworthy', 'committee', 'who', 'not', 'people', 'who', 'send', 'new', 'scores', 'beat', 'old', 'scores', 'can', 'truly', 'be', 'trusted', 'not', 'course', 'totally', 'fair', 'have', 'bet', 'Guinness', 'was', 'SO', 'thrilled', 'when', 'documentary', 'came', 'out', ""'re"", 'basically', 'record', 'saying', 'slip-shod', 'organization', 'word', 'good', 'enough', 'prestigious', 'publishing', 'ha.Fans', 'classic', 'gaming', 'will', 'love', 'documentary', 'fascinating', 'discussions', 'how', 'why', 'classic', 'games', 'were', 'impossibly', 'hard', 'master', 'often', 'were', 'as', 'well', 'interesting', 'programming', 'discussions', 'kill', 'screen', 'when', 'game', 'code', 'basically', 'just', 'out', 'Non-gamers', 'will', 'love', 'documentary', 'hilarious', 'personalities', 'display', 'really', 'not', 'single', 'person', 'documentary', 'who', ""n't"", 'take', 'travails', 'Donkey', 'Kong', 'machine', '*possessed*', 'far', 'far', 'more', 'seriously', 'average', 'viewer', 'will', 'results', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'hilarious.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",King of Kong:Fistful of Quarters (D/WS)

1114772,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,B000XQ4HR8,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[3, 3]","I always find it amazing that people give their consent to appear in films like this, and I can only think of two reasons why they would.  Either they are completely unaware of how they are going to come across on screen, or else the thrill of being filmed overrides any second thoughts.  I don't automatically assume anything about these people one way or another, but a film like this demands oddballs, so it's certainly in the filmmaker's vested interest to make them appear as entertaining as possible, to show them in the worst, or craziest, light.  For someone to blithely hand their image over to that sort of ringmaster seems way too trusting to me.Even so, 'King of Kong' is an extremely entertaining film, and as I assume no one put words into the participants mouths, the people in the film make the director's job that much easier - if he wants oddballs, all he has to do is keep the camera rolling and the people talking.  Many people interviewed and followed on film have spent a good chunk of their lives mastering classic arcade games, and while it might be tempting to snicker or look down on them for it, the subtle fact the film never raises is that any form of obsessive behavior lends itself to the silent ridicule of a camera's reflection.  It doesn't matter if one builds model trains in their basement or spends 30,000 dollars on a bass boat, desperately trailing after an obsession to the exclusion of any other worthwhile pursuit is just asking to be roasted on the spit of mockery.  Especially when the subjects are vying for the title of 'Best'.And superficially, that is what 'King of Kong' is about - two two-bit gladiators in search of the official Donkey Kong high score, and the right to inscribe their three letter call sign into the starry sky of the arcade galaxy.  Steve Wiebe, out of a job and in search of meaning and substance in his life, turns his attention instead to Donkey Kong and the decades old high score of that shining beacon of classic arcade game enthusiasts, the ayatollah of rock and rolla, Billy Mitchell.  How these two resolve the contest, and how at first the established gaming community closes ranks around Mitchell when he's challenged is indeed entertaining in a tempest in a teapot sort of way, and especially as a study in human psychology.But there's a distateful undertone to these people's pursuits too.  The first time Wiebe breaks the record, it's in his garage, and videotaped.  As he creeps nearer to the record, there is a point where his young son has some bathroom issues and needs parental assistance with toilet tissue.  At one point, you can hear the boy crying for his dad, and then scream, ""Please quit playing DONKEY KOOOOOONG!""  It is an excrutiating film moment.Steve Wiebe makes a statement halfway through the film to the effect that he was only looking for something that could be his, something that would belong to him after missing out on some other goals in life.  From the movie it's clear that he has pretty nice family (and one helluva supportive wife), and it seems sad that he's driven to such an extreme for a rather empty bid at immortality.  I can't condemn him though, as I've had plenty of obsessions myself both in the past and waiting for me in the future.  Except viewing those obsessions through the prism of competitive classic arcade gaming shines a pretty unfavorable light on obsessive behavior of any kind.",4,Buying immortality 25 cents at a time,1240099200,"04 19, 2009",2009,3415,"['always', 'find', 'amazing', 'people', 'give', 'consent', 'appear', 'films', 'can', 'only', 'think', 'two', 'reasons', 'why', 'would', 'are', 'completely', 'unaware', 'how', 'are', 'going', 'come', 'screen', 'else', 'thrill', 'being', 'filmed', 'second', 'thoughts', 'do', ""n't"", 'automatically', 'assume', 'anything', 'people', 'one', 'way', 'film', 'oddballs', 'certainly', 'filmmaker', 'vested', 'interest', 'make', 'appear', 'as', 'entertaining', 'possible', 'show', 'worst', 'craziest', 'light', 'someone', 'blithely', 'hand', 'image', 'sort', 'ringmaster', 'way', 'too', 'trusting', 'me.Even', 'so', ""'King"", 'Kong', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'film', 'assume', 'one', 'put', 'words', 'participants', 'mouths', 'people', 'film', 'make', 'director', 'job', 'much', 'easier', 'oddballs', 'do', 'keep', 'camera', 'rolling', 'people', 'talking', 'Many', 'people', 'interviewed', 'followed', 'film', 'have', 'spent', 'good', 'chunk', 'lives', 'mastering', 'classic', 'arcade', 'games', 'might', 'be', 'tempting', 'snicker', 'look', 'down', 'subtle', 'fact', 'film', 'never', 'form', 'obsessive', 'behavior', 'silent', 'ridicule', 'camera', 'reflection', ""n't"", 'matter', 'one', 'model', 'trains', 'basement', '30,000', 'dollars', 'bass', 'boat', 'desperately', 'trailing', 'obsession', 'exclusion', 'other', 'worthwhile', 'pursuit', 'just', 'asking', 'be', 'roasted', 'spit', 'mockery', 'Especially', 'when', 'subjects', 'are', 'vying', 'title', ""'Best'.And"", 'superficially', 'what', ""'King"", 'Kong', 'two', 'two-bit', 'gladiators', 'search', 'official', 'Donkey', 'Kong', 'high', 'score', 'right', 'inscribe', 'three', 'letter', 'call', 'sign', 'starry', 'sky', 'arcade', 'galaxy', 'Steve', 'Wiebe', 'job', 'search', 'meaning', 'substance', 'life', 'attention', 'instead', 'Donkey', 'Kong', 'decades', 'old', 'high', 'score', 'shining', 'beacon', 'classic', 'arcade', 'game', 'enthusiasts', 'ayatollah', 'rock', 'rolla', 'Billy', 'Mitchell', 'How', 'two', 'resolve', 'contest', 'how', 'first', 'established', 'gaming', 'community', 'ranks', 'around', 'Mitchell', 'when', 'challenged', 'indeed', 'entertaining', 'tempest', 'teapot', 'sort', 'way', 'especially', 'study', 'human', 'psychology.But', 'distateful', 'undertone', 'people', 'pursuits', 'too', 'first', 'time', 'Wiebe', 'record', 'garage', 'videotaped', 'nearer', 'record', 'point', 'where', 'young', 'son', 'bathroom', 'issues', 'parental', 'assistance', 'toilet', 'tissue', 'one', 'point', 'can', 'hear', 'boy', 'crying', 'dad', 'then', 'scream', 'Please', 'quit', 'playing', 'DONKEY', 'KOOOOOONG', 'excrutiating', 'film', 'moment.Steve', 'Wiebe', 'statement', 'halfway', 'film', 'effect', 'was', 'only', 'looking', 'something', 'could', 'be', 'something', 'would', 'belong', 'missing', 'out', 'other', 'goals', 'life', 'movie', 'clear', 'pretty', 'nice', 'family', 'one', 'helluva', 'supportive', 'wife', 'sad', 'driven', 'extreme', 'rather', 'empty', 'bid', 'immortality', 'ca', ""n't"", 'condemn', 'though', ""'ve"", 'had', 'plenty', 'obsessions', 'past', 'waiting', 'future', 'viewing', 'obsessions', 'prism', 'competitive', 'classic', 'arcade', 'gaming', 'shines', 'pretty', 'unfavorable', 'light', 'obsessive', 'behavior', 'kind']",King of Kong:Fistful of Quarters (D/WS)

This documentary is riveting. It is impossible to look away from despite all attempts. The only thing in my life that I can relate this to is when my cousin unplugged the Atari while I was killing at Asteroids. I was 13, and I think I got very mad for about 8 minutes. Maybe 9.The most troubling thing about this video is not what these people are attempting to do but rather their scruples, lack of them, or the nerdy lackeys that run around doing bigger nerds bidding. The way they look (bad hair, bad beards, bad dress) and the way the 80s have never seemed to end for them is good for a hoot. Billy Mitchell is depicted as some sort of evil nerd on high. In his former life he was probably some sort of carnival barker, wizard behind the curtain, puppet master pulling everyones strings for a laugh.Steve is essentially Lightening McQueen and Billy Mitchell is Chick Hicks. Go watch Pixars Cars and you will see what I mean. Integrity, being likable, and being a stand up guy with a stand up personality is, in the end, more important than any score on some video screen. I hope Steve realizes that.Why they use VHS instead of hard drives, live streaming video, DVDs or just play live is anyones best guess. It's a small bizarre community.Steve's wife (and family) is perhaps the best woman, no, make that the best lady on the planet. I thought my wife was understanding. WOW! Give Steve's wife a cigar. Give her a mansion!So if you are here reading this then you need no convincing to watch this. It's a good documentary, even thought it's also a bit sad.  Crumb, Crazy Love, and documentaries like them are similar in scope to this. Bizarre, small circles of people, in a zone, planet, world all their own. Aren't we all.***************What ever nerd decided to go with this lame DVD box image instead of the amazing poster for this film is the biggest nerd of all.

1114774,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,B000XQ4HR8,Chris Luallen,"[2, 2]","Steve Weibe is a middle school science teacher from Redmond, Washington. In the past Steve had strived for success in baseball and music. But, despite having some talent, he never quite made it to the top of the heap. Steve's current interest is in the classic arcade game Donkey Kong and this doc follows his quest to beat the world record. In contrast, Billy Mitchell, the long time record holder, comes across as an arrogant jerk who will stop at nothing to maintain his position as the ""King Of Kong"".Director Seth Gordon does a fine job spinning this tale of ""good vs evil"".But he never loses sight of the absurdity of the conflict, with touches of comedic irony mixed in with the all too real human emotions on display.Eccentric characters like Walter Day and the self-proclaimed ""Mr Awesome"" add to the film's charm, though there isn't anyone besides Steve and his family that I would personally want to hang out with. I especially enjoyed the soundtrack, including the hilarious use of Survivor's ""Eye Of The Tiger"" and Leonard Cohen's brillant ""Everybody Knows"".The DVD also includes some excellent bonus material.

Laid off from his job and with lots of time on his hands he decides to try and break the all-time high score on Donkey Kong, a 1980s arcade game. The record has been the same for over 20 years, held by video gaming legend Billy Mitchell. Steve films his attempts and when he finally breaks the record, sends the tape off to a small organization of people who have set themselves up as the keeper of the records. They disallow his record game for murky reasons so Steve flies across the country to New Hampshire to a gathering of gamers to play live. There he breaks the record again. Having witnessed it, they proclaim him the new king of Donkey Kong . . . until . . . they view a video tape sent by Billy Mitchell showing him recording an even higher score. Wiebe continues his quest but also tries to get Mitchell to come out and play him live head-to-head. Mitchell refuses to play.Steve Wiebe comes off as a sympathetic figure. Out of work and feeling bad about himself he turns to the video game record as a way to boost his self esteem while he figures his future out. Billy Mitchell is portrayed as a narcissistic douche who's scared to lose. Twin Galaxies, the organization given the power to accept or deny a filmed score, seems to want to do the right thing but are all too enamored of players like Billy and their sense of entitlement. They seemed reluctant to accept Steve's score mainly because they didn't know him. He was an interloper into their insular world and on top of that was a better player than them.The movie was funny at places that weren't necessarily intentional. The seriousness with which these video games records are taken by some of the participants leads to laughs.

It deserves some respect, and I think this was not just a goofy idea for a movie but worthwhile subject matter. What the director was very fortunate to discover, and exploited to the hilt, is that the egos and reputations in high level gaming are immense -- which makes for good drama. Yes, there is irony in the fact that it's in the end all done for a video game, but then again, what is the intrinsic worth of being able to do a slam dunk either? If anything, these video gamers could come in mighty handy if we ever had a ""war against the machines"" Terminator scenario (!)...but I digress.While this is a fascinating story about the underdog, and it is put together quite well, in the end it does not go into much detail about the fundamental methods or fascination of beating these games. Instead, it plays fast n' loose with the facts, exploiting the fragile nerd world in a way Jimmy Kimmel or another comedian might. In the end, we're all supposed to look at these guys as vindictive, somewhat pathetic outcasts.Most of the film derives its dramatic gravitas from the character of legendary gamer Billy Mitchell. He really is quite a fascinating man, truly insecure and villainous at times -- but obviously quite brilliant, insightful, and understandably protective of his reputation. This is one of those examples where everybody likes to pick on the guy, but in the end, he's the reason they came. He's a brutal competitor. At the same time, he is also the biggest spoiled brat in the world -- who learned video games playing endlessly in his Dad's restaurant and then had the whole franchise waiting for him when he became of age.  Billy now fancies himself a peerless entrepreneur. To me, it seems as though he has only shamelessly exploited his god-given talents and inherited position in life. Whereas his competitor, the dogged and unassuming Steve Wiebe, has fought tooth and nail to get just an ounce of respect for all of his abilities in various endeavors. It's actually a pretty amazing story, the kind of thing great novelists have written about.There is a sad, pathetic irony of how cutthroat the world of supposed ""escapist"" hobbies can be. I've encountered some of the most vicious backstabbing and arrogance with movie geeks and comic nerds. These worlds are created by legions of outcasts in an attempt to have something to call their own -- kind of like a big WASPy gang.

It's a great movie because it'll keep you riveted to the disaster that is the main character's lives and how they are dominant and famous in only an isolated group.  Fame for Minutia - the American Way.We are a nation obsessed by Fame.  The entertainment and sports sections are more read than the front page.

Paris Hilton is also a marketing genius despite her inability to pass any math or grammar test in our public schools.

1114781,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000XQ4HR8,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 2]","Man, I am all worked up after watching this fascinating film.  The King of Kong is about so much more than a video game record - this really is good vs. evil, the all-American underdog vs. the privileged elite, the little guy vs. city hall, etc.  It doesn't matter if you've never played a video game in your life.  If you have a competitive bone in your body or if you value truth and justice above deviousness and chicanery, you will find yourself drawn into this story.  For those of us who grew up playing Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, Galaga, and the like, it's an especially meaningful story - and the taint of unsportsmanlike conduct hits us even harder because of the nexus we can't help but draw with our own childhoods.  Donkey Kong may be ""just a silly video game,"" but this story about one man's attempt to break the world record becomes a metaphor for life and how to live it in the hands of these talented filmmakers.  Lest you think all nerds are the same, prepare to meet some true characters in this gaming drama.  You couldn't invent the likes of Billy Mitchell, the prima donna of gaming, or Walter Day, the folk-singing, self-appointed commissioner of classic arcade competitive gaming.Steve Wiebe is the quintessential good guy, an all-American kid who grew up to become a devoted husband, father, and teacher.  For whatever reason along the way, he just couldn't get a break each time he put himself in a position to realize his dreams.  After he was laid off from work, he set himself the goal of breaking the world record score for the original arcade version of Donkey Kong.  And break it he does, capturing the entire game on video - with one of his small children hollering at him in the background about a certain hygiene emergency at one point.  All he has to do is send the tape in to the official scorekeepers and reap the glory of his feat - or so you would think.  Unfortunately, Wiebe's moment in the sun comes to an abrupt end when the self-proclaimed lord of classic arcade game records, Walter Day of Twin Galaxies, proves himself to be little more than a puppet for longtime champion Billy Mitchell and comes up with an excuse to disqualify Wiebe's score when he learns that the circuit board for Wiebe's machine was supplied by Roy Shildt, one of Mitchell's bitter gaming enemies.  Oh, but Wiebe is more than welcome to come to Funspot Arcade in New Hampshire and prove himself on an officially sanctioned machine.  Wiebe does just that and proceeds to break the record right there in front of the gaming elite, including Billy Mitchell spies reporting every one of his moves to the mullet-headed king.  Ah, but Mitchell is prepared for that - with a tape of his own showing him breaking Wiebe's new record.  Strangely enough, there's a distortion in the tape right when the score maxes out and resets itself to zero - but Walter Day quickly declares it official and restores the crown to Billy Mitchell.Wiebe returns home and seemingly gives up his fight - until he hears that the next edition of Guinness World Records is going to include the names of Twin Galaxies record holders.  This mild-mannered everyman calls Billy Mitchell out and makes the journey to Mitchell's very home town, setting the stage for the long-awaited head-to-head challenge between the two.  Will it actually happen?  Will the champion who goes on and on about how the only scores that matter are the ones from live competitions yet depends on questionable videos of his own making to retain the crown finally face his biggest challenger face to face?  Will justice finally be served?  Believe me - you're going to want to find out what happens, even if you've never played a video game in your life.

Donkey Kong: Yes, the video game that we played back in the 1980s.This documentary is particularly skilled in that it gets the viewer to care deeply about a subject and characters that one normally would have no interest in.  I don't care about video games, but I couldn't resist rooting for the underdog in this saga.  The tension builds and builds until the credits roll.In contrast toSpellbound, another extremely entertaining documentary, King of Kong has much less innate appeal.  Spellbound is about kids trying to achieve something great; King of Kong is about middle-aged men playing video games rather than spending time helping their kids with their spelling.  But this film delivers not only a great conflict (with the theme songs from bothThe Karate Kidand Rocky) but also a cast of characters more entertaining than any screenwriter could invent.Even the DVD extras, with the brief history of Donkey Kong and the film festival appearances by Donkey Kong challenger Steve Wiebe, were entertaining.Two favorite lines:1. [Walter Day, international referee for retro video games]  I wanted to be a hero. I wanted to be the center of attention. I wanted the glory, I wanted the fame. I wanted the pretty girls to come up and say, ""Hi, I see that you're good at Centipede.""2.

1114785,A2VZP50FSYD6CO,B000XQ4HR8,drebbles,"[4, 4]","""The King of Kong"" is a classic look at good vs. evil as Steve Wiebe challenges Billy Mitchell for the Donkey Kong title that Mitchell has held for years. Wiebe comes across as a lovable, devoted family man who starts playing Donkey Kong when he loses his job and who just wants to be a winner for once. Mitchell comes across as a bit arrogant, wanting to hold on to his title as champ, refusing to meet with Wiebe in a face to face challenge, even as he emphasizes the importance of ""live"" scores.""The King of Kong"" is a fascinating look into the world of classic game competition. You can't help but end up cheering for Wiebe and hating Mitchell as the movie goes along. This is partly due to the somewhat controversial editing that shows Wiebe at home, surrounded by family, trying and failing to meet with Mitchell, and willing to show up in public to challenge the title. On the other hand, you only catch brief glimpses inside Mitchell's home, an even briefer glimpse of his wife, and when he does meet up with Wiebe, he basically ignores him.  His unwillingness (at least at that time of the documentary) to defend his record in public is perplexing, especially since he stresses throughout the documentary how important it is to do it ""live"". His sending a videotape of him setting a record in Donkey Kong to Funspot while Wiebe is competing live is one of the more infuriating things he does in the documentary as is Walter Day's decision to use the score on the tape even though he had questions about the tape (to be fair, ""The King of Kong"" neglects to mention that Mitchell's score was soon taken down).What makes ""The King of Kong"" so interesting is how important the record in Donkey Kong is to both Wiebe and Mitchell. It's clear that Mitchell loves the ""fame"" that comes with the title of Donkey Kong champ. But Wiebe is no less determined to gain the title, sometimes almost neglecting his children (the scene with him first breaking the score is both funny and sad as his children struggle to gain his attention). His young daughter has perhaps the most telling line in the documentary: ""I never knew that the Guinness World Record Book was so... I never knew it was so important... Some people sort of ruin their lives to be in there."" Also interesting are some of the other players who are also competing on various games (I would have loved to see more of the late Doris Self, the oldest video game competitor, who once set a world record in Q-Bert). The scene where Wiebe reaches a kill screen in Donkey Kong shows just how exciting competition can be not just to those playing the game, but those playing other games as well.""The King of Kong"" is a good, if not perfect documentary. The film plays with facts a little too much - the producers not only omit the bit about Mitchell's high score being quickly taken down, but the fact that Wiebe was not the first to seriously challenge Mitchell's records, there had been an earlier much disputed, record breaking score. The film also neglects to mention that even though Mitchell made it into the 2007 Guiness World Records for the highest score in Donkey Kong, Wiebe also is listed in Guinness for the highest score in Donkey Kong, Jr. There is also some dispute as to whether Wiebe and Mitchell did meet up, especially in a restaurant scene that is edited to look like Mitchell is avoiding Wiebe; and what exactly happened when people came to Wiebe's house to examine his Donkey Kong machine. Oddly enough, these omissions and disputed facts only serve to make the move even more interesting.""The King of Kong"" is a fascinating documentary.",4,Fascinating Look at Carnival Like World of Competitive Gaming,1205884800,"03 19, 2008",2008,3614,"['King', 'Kong', 'classic', 'look', 'good', 'vs.', 'Steve', 'Wiebe', 'Billy', 'Mitchell', 'Donkey', 'Kong', 'title', 'Mitchell', 'held', 'years', 'Wiebe', 'across', 'lovable', 'devoted', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'playing', 'Donkey', 'Kong', 'when', 'job', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'winner', 'once', 'Mitchell', 'across', 'bit', 'arrogant', 'wanting', 'hold', 'title', 'champ', 'refusing', 'meet', 'Wiebe', 'face', 'face', 'challenge', 'even', 'importance', 'live', 'scores', 'King', 'Kong', 'fascinating', 'look', 'world', 'classic', 'game', 'competition', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'end', 'up', 'cheering', 'Wiebe', 'hating', 'Mitchell', 'movie', 'along', 'partly', 'due', 'somewhat', 'controversial', 'editing', 'Wiebe', 'home', 'surrounded', 'family', 'trying', 'failing', 'meet', 'Mitchell', 'willing', 'show', 'up', 'public', 'challenge', 'title', 'other', 'hand', 'only', 'catch', 'brief', 'glimpses', 'Mitchell', 'home', 'even', 'briefer', 'glimpse', 'wife', 'when', 'meet', 'up', 'Wiebe', 'basically', 'unwillingness', 'least', 'time', 'documentary', 'defend', 'record', 'public', 'perplexing', 'especially', 'documentary', 'how', 'important', 'do', 'live', 'sending', 'videotape', 'setting', 'record', 'Donkey', 'Kong', 'Funspot', 'Wiebe', 'competing', 'live', 'one', 'more', 'infuriating', 'things', 'documentary', 'Walter', 'Day', 'decision', 'use', 'score', 'tape', 'even', 'had', 'questions', 'tape', 'be', 'fair', 'King', 'Kong', 'mention', 'Mitchell', 'score', 'was', 'soon', 'taken', 'down', 'King', 'Kong', 'so', 'interesting', 'how', 'important', 'record', 'Donkey', 'Kong', 'Wiebe', 'Mitchell', 'clear', 'Mitchell', 'fame', 'title', 'Donkey', 'Kong', 'champ', 'Wiebe', 'less', 'determined', 'gain', 'title', 'sometimes', 'almost', 'neglecting', 'children', 'scene', 'first', 'breaking', 'score', 'funny', 'sad', 'children', 'struggle', 'gain', 'attention', 'young', 'daughter', 'perhaps', 'most', 'telling', 'line', 'documentary', 'never', 'knew', 'Guinness', 'World', 'Record', 'Book', 'was', 'so', 'never', 'knew', 'was', 'so', 'important', 'people', 'sort', 'ruin', 'lives', 'be', 'there', 'Also', 'interesting', 'are', 'other', 'players', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'competing', 'various', 'games', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'more', 'late', 'Doris', 'Self', 'oldest', 'video', 'game', 'competitor', 'who', 'once', 'set', 'world', 'record', 'Q-Bert', 'scene', 'where', 'Wiebe', 'kill', 'screen', 'Donkey', 'Kong', 'just', 'how', 'exciting', 'competition', 'can', 'be', 'not', 'just', 'playing', 'game', 'playing', 'other', 'games', 'well', 'King', 'Kong', 'good', 'not', 'perfect', 'documentary', 'film', 'facts', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'producers', 'not', 'only', 'omit', 'bit', 'Mitchell', 'high', 'score', 'being', 'quickly', 'taken', 'down', 'fact', 'Wiebe', 'was', 'not', 'first', 'seriously', 'challenge', 'Mitchell', 'records', 'had', 'been', 'earlier', 'much', 'disputed', 'record', 'breaking', 'score', 'film', 'also', 'mention', 'even', 'Mitchell', 'made', '2007', 'Guiness', 'World', 'Records', 'highest', 'score', 'Donkey', 'Kong', 'Wiebe', 'also', 'listed', 'Guinness', 'highest', 'score', 'Donkey', 'Kong', 'Jr', 'also', 'dispute', 'Wiebe', 'Mitchell', 'did', 'meet', 'up', 'especially', 'restaurant', 'scene', 'edited', 'look', 'Mitchell', 'avoiding', 'Wiebe', 'what', 'exactly', 'happened', 'when', 'people', 'came', 'Wiebe', 'house', 'examine', 'Donkey', 'Kong', 'machine', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'omissions', 'disputed', 'facts', 'only', 'serve', 'make', 'move', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'King', 'Kong', 'fascinating', 'documentary']",King of Kong:Fistful of Quarters (D/WS)

It follows Steve Weibe, an amateur Donkey Kong enthusiast on his journey to beating Donkey Kong champion Billy Mitchell's top score. It doesn't matter if you follow arcade gaming or not, this documentary is more about how Weibe is consumed by the competitiveness of the gaming scene and how he overcomes the obstacles thrown by his opponents while remaining an honest person.What makes this documentary great is that was not dramaticized.

This battle of the geekoids -- new against old, cocky champion against hopeful challenger -- is worthy of a smarmy Hollywood farce.  But the charcters that director Seth Gordon has captured in ""The King of Kong"" are very real and very commited to their hobby. The craf involved in the story is a matter of smart editing, not of clever writing.When it came to enjoying this film, it didn't hurt that my family lives within easy driving of Weirs Beach, NH, where some of the action in this film takes place. We visited Funspot just last weekend, and saw the very machines recorded in the film. The place is real, the competitors are real and the competition is real. It's hard to imagine a more fascinating battle, with more different competitors. Champion Bobby Mithell has held the Donkey Kong title since 1982. He has parlayed his notoriety into a successful hot sauce business. With his BeeGee's era beard and blow-dried do, he clearly thinks more than a little about himself. His competitor, Steve Wiebe, is a schlumpy Seattle dad and science teacher -- the kind of guy with lot of talent who has never quite hit the big time in spite of his enormous ambitions to succeed. He finally finds his niche in playing Donkey Kong. Buying his own game, he maps the game's dozens of screens, mastering moves that he hopes will give him the success that has always just barely eluded him. Though their sympathies are clearly with Wiebe, the filmmakers never let on how the contest will come out until the end.Congratulations to the makers of ""The King of Kong"" for letting this small, strange demimonde of players, wannabes and self-styled referees speak for itself. A wonderful achievement of the documentary form, with a little help from some very out-there characters. Bravo. Ding! Flash!

I attend the WCG (the olympics of video game competitions) whenever possible and the last time was in 2004 in San Francisco. I've seen amazing abilities taken for granted and let me say that King Kong is amazing, but I really don't see it as more competitive than say Star Craft, which is truelly amazing to witness when two professional gamers (usually Korean) face off for ten minutes doing the near impossible of over 100 actions per second. Real Time Strategy games are so far above my talent levels and that of Kong that it's hard for me to really get excited over the gameplay level. I am more impressed by the characterizations of this movie and the role playing that the directors force into shape; oh, and the music rocks. It's almost laughable how they transform Billy Mitchell into the devil and Steve the ultimate hero (though he's a good person). It's hard when Billy has children also but you only see Steve Wiebe's family to feel anything for Billy. But I had a great time with this Film. And more important, it's a great experience because it's fresh, unexpected (c'mon, nobody could have guessed Kong would get it's own documentary!) and great to pop in for the family. I'm not sure why it's PG-13. I guess they used Chumpatized too many times or something. It is the complete opposite of the norm documentary in that even this movie seems to say that nobody gives a crap about Kong and the top score, there were no teeming crowds, only dark and depressing little arcade spots populated by older men with pockets of quarters. There were maybe ten people who watche Steve break Billy's record from the early 80's. It's that irresistable classic story of good versus bad and our shaking desire to see the outcome of it all.

Before I knew it, the end titles were coming up.  This movie starts out slowly and you think it's going to be for hard-core gamers only and then it just sucks you in.The first time you see Billy Mitchell on screen, standing in front of a copy machine wearing a button up shirt and tie, hair unfashionably long and blunt cut, with facial hair right out of the 70s, your first thought is ""loser.""  Some of this comes from the popular image of people who are hard-core game players as not having real lives.  It comes a surprise, therefore, to find out that not only is Mitchell a world champion video gamer, he is an exceptionally successful business person who is married and has children.  Nevertheless, this doesn't stop him from coming across as a world-class jerk.  While this is no doubt due somewhat to editing, no one put words into Mitchell's mouth and after a while you'll want to roll your eyes at his pompous pontificating.  Still, he's the rock star of video gamers and the world-record holder in Donkey Kong, and even if you think that people who spend that much time going after such a seemingly useless world record need to get a life, you can't argue with the fact that Billy Mitchell certainly seems to have one, even if you'd never want to be part of it.Steve Wiebe, on the other hand, is one of those guys you'd love to have as your best friend.  Just as no amount of editing could make Billy Mitchell into the jerk he obviously is, no amount of editing in a picture this long could make Steve Wiebe out to be such a good guy if he weren't genuinely good natured.  Even when the video gaming world seems to be conspiring against him to make sure that Billy Mitchell stays on top, Wiebe has a smile on his face.  He's smart, good-looking, talented, and also married and a father.  And such a sap that times, you just want to slap him for putting up with everything with such good grace.The movie is about Wiebe's attempt to break Mitchell's long-standing world record for the highest ever Donkey Kong score.  Those of us old enough to have played the game back in its heyday will remember how fun it was as well as its sheer impossibility.  But even if you never played, or if that funny looking little guy dodging fireballs and falling barrels while trying hopelessly to rescue the girl never appealed to you, chances are you'll find this movie delightful.  Because this movie is not about a video game, it's about what drives us to keep going in the face of the odds.  The filmmakers do a great job of eliciting from the participants, particularly Wiebe, the reasons for their attraction to the game and the pursuit of the all time high score.  Actual gameplay is kept to a minimum, which is frustrating for those of us who really liked the game, but what keeps it interesting even for people who've never held a joystick.  Even if you think such a pursuit is really stupid, you'll probably find yourself torn when Steve Wiebe has to choose between breaking the world record and wiping his young son's bottom.  You really end up rooting for him.The supporting players are almost as entertaining as Wiebe and Mitchell, especially Walter Day, the folksinging, meditating, self-appointed guru of the gaming world, who seems to be going out of his way to keep Billy Mitchell on top.  Seriously, you couldn't invent this guy.Seth Gordon, the director of this film, worked on the movie New York Doll, and he seems to have picked up some of that film's ability to transcend the subject matter and keep us interested in people who might not otherwise seem like anyone we'd want to watch for a couple of hours.  That Gordon can make Donkey Kong into a metaphor for life, and an entertaining one at that, is no mean accomplishment.

I dumped probably thousands of dollars in quarters down those thirsty video boxes; a few of them I got good at. Donkey Kong was not one of them, (neither Pacman or Space Invaders. Galaga was my game.)Anyway, you turn some corner at some time and video games are no longer interesting. Everything moved to the TV games boxes anyway, so . . .Who knew there was a *very serious* cadre of 40ish men out there still taking not just video games seriously, but an entire subculture of high scores and ""officially sanctioned"" record keeping bodies.Watch this movie and you'll find out tons more about this than you ever thought possible. Its *amazing* the producers actually caught this while it happened: some ""baby face"" upstart decides to challenge a decades old high score on Donkey Kong - one of the most difficult and never-ending video games ever produced. Not only does he set the record, he runs smack into one of the strangest sub-cultures around: *Idol Worship* of the long-reigning Grand Poobah of Kong, Billy Mitchell, (not the airplane pilot.)Turns out ol' Billy played lights out back in the mid 80's and actually became Lord of this very small but incredibly competitive and serious-minded game players. (When you step back and consider, in the grand light of all things, who could possibly care about any of this; and then you find these guys totally wrapped up, its a recipe for endless head-shaking.)Cheating? Did someone say *cheating?* Yep, this genre is so hardscrabble and cut throat that some have even dared to jimmy the game itself to get an advantage, (and the baby faced upstart is accused of using a ""tricked up"" video machine from a known cheater.) The lengths some people will go to . . .Billy Mitchell. Massive head-case here. Holding onto his high record status like King Saul. Will not even VISUALLY ACKNOWLEDGE his competition when he makes a ""special appearance"" at his home town arcade.Oh, that's right. There are some out of the way nooks and crannies in this country that are actually considered MECAS for 30 year old video game machines, and hold national tournaments on a yearly basis, (and you can just smell the testosterone.)If you ever read or saw the movie King Rat, you'll understand a bit more of how this works; one guy and ONE GUY ONLY is going to be at the top of this heap, and that's Billy Mitchell.

1114801,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B000XQ4HR8,K. Driscoll,"[2, 2]","The King of Kong is about the conflict that arose in 2005 as Steve Wiebe challenged Billy Mitchell's impressive world record.  The record?  It is the 25 year long highest score on the 1981 arcade game Donkey Kong.  He had 800,000 points, and that my friends is quite a bit of busted barrels and fallen monkeys.It turns out that The King of Kong is a wonderful underdog film.  Steve Weibe is portrayed as a likeable everyman who just happens to have a knack for the extreme patience and analytical skill to get such a score. He is described by his family as a savant in some respects but he seems like a relatively normal guy. As a fellow-gamer, I will concede that it takes some work to do what both these guys have done.  On the other side of the coin, we get the sub-culture's heroic golden boy Billy Mitchell.  Billy is portrayed as the villainous and elitist coward and I get the feeling that he didn't get a fair shake from our documentarian Seth Gordon, but I can't be sure.  Billy has a charisma and bravado that will turn most people off, but in his own culture he is the man and his big old mullet is indeed very cool.  He is very successful far beyond his game-playing however, owning his own restaurant and homemade line of hot sauces.  He is the ""Sauce King"" of Florida.  I actually liked Billy but most viewers are going to hate him.  Then again, I almost always root for the villain in these formulaic good vs. evil kind of films.  The people I really didn't like were his toadies and minions who seemed to support Billy and undermine Steve consistently throughout.There are great characters in this movie.  In addition to Steve and Billy we have Walter Day; the referee and founder of Twin Galaxies, a small arcade that evolved into an organization that tracks video game world records.  Walter is also a songwriter and provides some surreal impromptu folk singing.  Steve Saunders is the old nemesis of Billy who was handedly defeated by the Donkey Kong prodigy 25 years ago.  He is now one of Billy's friends, who in many ways come off more as disciples.  Brian Kuh for example is portrayed as the quintessential Billy Mitchell toady.  He has played Donkey Kong with great enthusiasm as well and put up some very high scores, but he is humbled in person by Weibe's gaming chops.  Brian walks around the arcade containing his jealously with this bizarrely awkward disposition that was one of the film's highlights for me.  He just couldn't wait for Billy to come along and take this guy's score out!  Another character is Roy Shildt or Mr. Awesome.  Mr. Awesome is a fitness guru and a self-proclaimed pickup artist.  Well, where else would one find such a person but in the underworld of classic arcade gaming?  Mr. Awesome is one of Billy's hated rivals and he is accused of unfairly assisting Steve in his quest to shatter Billy's record.Anyway, the fascinating thing about this film is that it does come off as formulaic in some respects but that is just fine with me because it is coverage of real life.  I'm sure that the editing favored Steve Weibe, but that is because there was a really fun and interesting story to tell within Gordon's footage.  I obviously loved this movie and I would guess that anyone who has any interest in this kind of thing would as well but my wife, who has rarely if ever played any video games, loved it too.

Best case scenario for a documentary -- I take away  life enriching information in exchange for a few hours of my time. Worst case scenario -- I'm given great ice breakers or party conversation.

Then comes the challenger, a man driven to conquer and able to rock the King's Mountain.Throw in the supporting cast, some serious, serious quirkiness and you've got yourself a very memorable few hours. One note. Be forewarned that one particularly over-the-top character turned his record-breaking game win into a Playgirl spread.

I thought it was gonna be more funny than it was (though it IS funny), but it really does capture your attention.Back in the 80's, TIME magazine had an article about some of the best players of video games in America. Centipede, Joust, Pac-Man...all the greats were there. And Donkey Kong. One of the hardest games ever made. And Billy Walsh was the King of that barrel throwing ape. He destroyed the scoreboards with a score of 800k+. Over 300K from 2nd place. It was ridiculous. The man had been on top of that game since 1986.And then comes along a Steve Weibe who caught a slight case of the OCD (heh). Steve beats the score, but it's a taped score, so the judges that take in tapes at Twin Galaxies, aren't to sure if this wasn't a hoax or a trick or just downright cheating.Now this is where I begin to say ""Holy Crap... these nerds are ruthless!"" Supposedly this one guy self nicknamed ""Mr. Awesome"" has the top score for missile command but Twin Galaxies won't give him credit for it. So he is at war basically with Billy Walsh. So he helped out Steve with a card for his Donkey Kong machine, which made the Twin Galaxy officials think it's a rigged board. I was seriously sitting on my couch laughing out how almost fake this is...but it's all true.So to prove his worth Steve plays live and once again breaks the record all the while having a lackey (yes...a dang lackey who thinks he's a prot&eacute;g&eacute;) of Billy Walsh standing behind him making comments and you just KNOW he's trying to get under Steve's skin. I even caught myself saying out loud to the TV to 'STFU MAN!' Then there is scandal after scandal. Tapes. No Show's. The Guinness Book of World Records.

1114811,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000XQ4HR8,mirasreviews,"[24, 26]","""The King of Kong"" follows the 2004-2006 rivalry and resulting controversy for the title of Donkey Kong Champion between longtime record holder and Gamer of the Century Billy Mitchell and challenger Steve Wiebe. Wiebe is cast in the role of heroic underdog, a junior high school science teacher from Washington state who has chosen Donkey Kong as the vehicle of his success after a series of disappointments in other fields. When Wiebe's videotaped record-breaking game is rejected by Twin Galaxies, the regulatory organization for classic arcade records, Steve is forced to try to break the record live, with referee Walter Day as a witness. Meanwhile, defending champion Billy Mitchell, a hot sauce mogul from Florida, avoids the challenge of his rival for fear of losing his title.I didn't realize that the interest in retro arcade games is still so intense, as I haven't seen hide nor hair of one of these machines since the 1980s. Director Seth Gordon has fashioned a story from a competition that takes place in front of video game screens by focusing on the characters and the controversy. He digs into Steve Wiebe's past to find motivation, accurate or not, for his obsessive pursuit of the Donkey Kong title. Billy Mitchell is portrayed as a egomaniac who tries to manipulate Twin Galaxies' acceptance of challengers' scores. His fear of defeat after 20 years on top is understandable, even if his actions are not admirable. I have no interest in video games, but ""The King of Kong"" is a character drama that is at once compelling and curious.The DVD (New Line 2008): Bonus features include 10 bonus scenes, 11 extended interviews, a DVD-ROM (Windows only), a theatrical trailer (2 min), a Glossary of 12 arcade terms, 2 feature commentaries, and: ""The Saga Continues"" updates us on the rivalry for the Donkey Kong title since 2006. ""A Really, Really Brief History of Donkey Kong"" (1 min) is a fast-talking animated history of the game. ""I am 8-bit"" is a gallery of 18 frames of a group art project, with music, inspired by classic arcade games. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish.The first feature commentary is by the filmmakers. Director Seth Gordon, producer Ed Cunningham, and associate producer Clay Tweel tell us how they discovered the story, how different parts of the film were conceived, and provide additional history of the people and relationships in the film. The second feature commentary is by Chris Carlyle, entertainment editorial director for IGN, and Jon M. Gibson, founder of ""i am 8-bit"". This is a conversational, often joking commentary about the people in the film.

He finds that cause in his quest to master Donkey Kong -- allegedly the most challenging of all the classic video games.  The problem is that reigning champion Billy Mitchell is not about to give up his title as the King of Kong -- one of the last remaining crowns upon which he's staked his reputation and his ego.  The first record set by Steve is challenged on legal grounds -- with the suggestion that he must have tampered with his machine.  His new challenge is to set the record straight, in public and in person -- but Billy is just too slick to put his record on the line without a few tricks up his sleeve.This is really as good as it gets in documentary territory -- fun, funny, heartbreaking, tense, exciting, enraging.  It's all there -- and what is so quirky and odd is that the stakes can be so high in what appears on the face of it to be the most trivial of contests.  It is rare that a documentarian can find a protagonist as likeable and worthy but down on his luck as Steve Wiebe and an antagonist as devious and clever and diabolical as his weaselly slick archnemesis Jedi from the darkside Billy Mitchell.

The story does look at the history of video games and the high scores people achieve on them, but the essence of the documentary revolves around unassuming nice guy Steve Wiebe, a virtual unknown in the competitive gaming field and brash, cocky and arrogant Billy Mitchell, named gamer of the century and generally considered the greatest gamer of all time.  Mr. Wiebe has set out to break Mr. Mitchell's long standing Donkey Kong high score record.  Spending hours mastering the game in his garage and filming his attempts, he finally thinks he breaks the record.  When he sends it in for verification to Twin Galaxies, the organization that tracks and verifies the records, he is denied as his machine is inspected and found to contain a circuit board provided by Roy Schildt who is Mr. Mitchell's nemesis. Forced to play in person at the official gaming arcade in New Hampshire, Mr. Wiebe must force the people at Twin Galaxies to not just accept his high score, but fight for his integrity and credibility as player, Mr. Wiebe does indeed break Mr. Mitchell's score.  Despite Mr. Mitchell railing against players who videotape themselves in order to break records, he sends in a tape to Twin Galaxies that shows he re-sets the high score.

Just ask the legions of retro arcade gamers and enthusiasts throughout the world if there is one game that TRULY stands the test of time in its game design and challenge level and Donkey Kong will quickly rise to the top of the list.  Still challenging and still fun after all these years Miyamoto's masterpiece becomes the center of an unlikely documentary.  There is a protagonist and an antagonist, there is turmoil and there are hardships, this is 2 very different mens story as they attempt to master the machine know as KONG.Director Seth Gordon doesn't get in the way of his subject matter with too many technical tricks he lets the game and the men speak for themselves.  By the end of King of Kong you will look at videogames and the electronic athletes who play them in a whole new light and you might find yourself trying to best one of TWIN GALAXIES high scores yourself.A fascinating study in what makes the human animal such a competitive and obsessive beast we also see the softer side of humanity in the oddly touching real life character of WALTER DAY, enthusiast and official referee for videogame high scores he is like an enlightened champion for all the pale and sallow geeks who have risked their health for HIGH SCORES.  This DVD is packed with highly entertaining extras that go on and on, my favorite is the I AM 8 Bit section with art and music inspired by and from the 8 bit era. The extended interviews are fascinating overall, listening to 2 gamers break down the facts and frustration in Burgertime is one the most hilarious discussions about gaming I have ever seen.

It's the characters that make it- an ensemble cast of weirdos, the inner circle of competitive gaming- who are easily as compelling as any dreamed up by an author or screenwriter. Billy Mitchell, portrayed as the conniving villain, comes off as having all the vile cynicism and self-worshiping arrogance of a bad guy from Marvel comics. Even his dark clothes and unnerving hairstyle fit the role. Weibe is a mild-mannered father simply trying to make something of himself, and becomes helplessly entangled in the bewilderingly serious world of making and keeping high scores on vintage arcade games. I was amazed by the one guy from Twin Galaxies, showing us the hours and hours of videotaped game sessions that it is his responsibility to watch all the way through, confirming that the players did not cheat at any point. As some would say, you can't make this stuff up. And, for the most part, the story keeps a respectful stance towards its easily-lampooned characters. This isn't Napoleon Dynamite. The joke isn't on the gamers, rather it's amazement at the world in which they exist that drives the film.SPOILER: It's also worth noting, for moral reasons, that director Seth Gordon wasn't exactly a saint of objectivity in the making of this movie... some research online made it clear that he actually took some significant liberties in the editing room (he admitted this himself), contrary to what Amazon.com's reviewer may think.

Zwick,"[3, 3]","****1/2The superb documentary, ""The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters"" takes us to a strange and fascinating world in which otherwise reasonable, responsible adults compete to become the high scoring champions of such video arcade classics as Pac Man, Ms. Pac Man, Asteroids, and, of course, the inimitable Donkey Kong.Seth Gordon's film focuses on two key players in the field - Billy Mitchell, who has held the high-scoring record for Donkey Kong since 1982, and Steve Wiebe, who, in 2005 (the time of the movie), was threatening to knock Mitchell off his throne.  The movie is mainly about Wiebe's obsession with challenging Mitchell to a competition and Mitchell's dodging Wiebe's efforts at virtually every turn.  Like a true king who has long enjoyed the privileges and trappings and sense of entitlement that come with royalty, Mitchell is clearly not one who will abdicate easily.At first, it seems as if the movie is going to be just another tale of quirky obsession in a niche area that the majority of us know little or nothing about.  Yet, a funny thing happened to this movie on its way to completion. It found its own unforeseen drama in the nature of the two protagonists.  When they began making their documentary, the filmmakers clearly had no intention of making one of their subjects a ""hero"" and the other a ""villain,"" but, thanks to the actions of each of the men, that is exactly how things eventually turned out.  For Wiebe emerges as a pretty decent guy overall, a bit obsessed with the game perhaps (as, indeed, any person bucking for the title of world champion would have to be), but a comparatively modest, hardworking family man who is treated rather shabbily by the official record keepers of the sport, Twin Galaxies (though they do tend to redeem themselves somewhat at the end).  The many comments from Wiebe's supportive wife, Nicole, and others who know him, go a long way towards humanizing his character.  Mitchell, on the other hand, comes across on camera as a real jerk, a conceited individual more concerned with maintaining his record than engaging in open and honest competition with a potential rival.  It is this unexpected turn into insightful character study that gives the film its special added kick.Beyond its probing of obsession and competition on an individual level, the movie also lays bare the complex political dynamics that take place behind the scenes and away from the competitions themselves.  We see the manipulation that goes into deciding which scores to validate and which to not, as well as the ""boys' club"" mentality that favors established stars like Mitchell over upstart newcomers to the scene like Wiebe.  In fact, Wiebe spends most of his time in the film simply trying to get some of his record scores accepted by Twin Galaxies.""The King of Kong"" would make an impressive double feature with ""Air Guitar Nation,"" yet another study of a fringe world filled with obsessive/compulsive players and cutthroat competition.

""..R..""","[0, 0]","The King of Kong is a documentary about a legendary gamer and Rickey's Hot Sauce creator,  Billy Mitchell and his new gaming foe Steve Wiebe. Both men are trying to get and keep the best scores possible for the classic Nintendo arcade game Donkey Kong. Billy Mitchell is the current champion in the movie. Billy has held top scores in many classic arcade games over the years; Donkey Kong being the last title he held onto. Steve Wiebe, currently a Science teacher, decides he has plenty of time to challenge for the highest score possible in Donkey Kong; after he finds him self laid off by Boeing. The movie almost seems to good to be true. Steve Wiebe, being the nicest of nice guys. The prototype of a good father and husband. Against the brash, and often times rude for no real reason, Billy Mitchell. The movie mainly follows Steve Wiebe, in his quest for the title. Billy Mitchell is featured in many segments, but mainly as a protagonist. Billy makes claims of being the best and makes a comment to the effect That To Be The Best, You Have To Play Live. Playing Live in front of a crowd being the only way to truly prove you are the best. This comment is the basis for the entire movie. Steve Wiebe flies all over the US showing off his skills, all in the hopes of being recognized as the best Gamer. While Billy tries his best to avoid him. In a deleted scene on the DVD, you get to see a comparisons of both men's game play. While Billy mainly uses hammers to destroy objects to gain maximum points, Steve uses tricks to adjective his best scores. Like jumping up and down on certain platform stages to get extra bonus points. These differences give some room for an argument on who is truly best, because while both men are adjectiving top scores, both men are doing it in different ways. So who is better? The game player, or the person that finds the loopholes? Both men are by far some of the best gamers on Earth, so respect has to go to given to both of them. As of 2008, Billy Mitchell holds the top scores for Donkey Kong, but Steve has not given up on reclaiming his top scores.This movie is very enjoyable. I have seen it both on DVD and on G4. It is not a movie I can get bored of. So if you are into video games, even if you don't play the classics's, King of Kong is still right for you. I didn't want to write too much in the way of reviewing the core storyline, because I don't think I review should give away the entire movie.

And the veteran champ Billy Mitchell seems to always be one step ahead, keeping Wiebe from his record.This was a very well executed documentary, if for no other reason than the fact that there is no way I could identify with the obsession of a competitive gamer, but I was truly cheering for Weibe to somehow overcome the obstacles in his way and win.Even if this is not your usual genre or subject matter, give this one a view.",4,The Sea Biscuit of video game films,1238716800,"04 3, 2009",2009,1138,"['documentary', 'started', 'slowly', 'wish', 'wife', 'had', 'seen', 'would', 'appreciate', 'man', 'compared', 'competitive', 'gamers', 'beginning', 'film', 'King', 'Kong', 'Sea', 'Biscuit', 'video', 'game', 'films', 'young', 'unheralded', 'unlikely', 'West', 'Coast', 'competitor', 'finds', 'real', 'success', 'travels', 'country', 'chase', 'challenge', 'established', 'East', 'Coast', 'titan', 'record', 'book', 'hangs', 'balance', 'Sea', 'Biscuit', 'established', 'champ', 'newcomer', 'everything', 'own', 'advantage.Somewhere', 'line', 'became', 'truly', 'invested', 'challenger', 'Steve', 'Wiebe', 'quest', 'growing', 'minute', 'wanted', 'victory', 'more', 'more', 'veteran', 'champ', 'Billy', 'Mitchell', 'always', 'be', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'keeping', 'record.This', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'executed', 'documentary', 'other', 'reason', 'fact', 'way', 'could', 'identify', 'obsession', 'competitive', 'gamer', 'was', 'truly', 'cheering', 'Weibe', 'somehow', 'overcome', 'obstacles', 'way', 'win.Even', 'not', 'usual', 'genre', 'subject', 'matter', 'give', 'one', 'view']",King of Kong:Fistful of Quarters (D/WS)

I couldn't help but get wrapped up in what is a completely absurb competition and root for the underdog Wiebe.  I don't remember the last scripted movie that made me want to see the reigning champ get his title stripped away more.  I thoroughly enjoyed this battle for the highest score.  The rivalry between the two men builds in a very intense way, considering they barely ever appear onscreen together.

But they are F-U-N.And like those games this film is fun. It's put together perfectly and with a love for the 80's games. The music for the soundtrack is well chosen. The characters are interesting and depressing all at the same time. It's a short, wonderful film about discovering yourself and realizing it's never to late to get good at something.

To watch Mitchell move competing hot sauce products on the shelves of a market to make more room for his own is a good encapsulation of the person portrayed in the video. Shifting things around while no one else is looking to make himself look better.  Equivalent to having his lapdog play the video while the good guy is busting his rear trying to win the record LIVE.

Games like Pac Man, Donkey Kong, Centipede, Joust, Defender, and Galaga are simple in terms of graphics and goals. These were the classic ""man vs computer"" machines that judged a player's skills based on the points system. After this generation of classic video games, scores are pretty much obsolete for the next generation of video games since the whole object is to complete the game. The points total represented a gamer's skill in classic pattern recognition, quick reaction, critical thinking, pattern analysis and response, as well as hand-eye coordination. These vintage games will never be equaled, and will continue to live on.This documentary represents both the old and the new very well in terms of the actual gamers that love and play these games competitively. The film kicks off with a little background and then jumps right into the story of Billy Mitchell, the man who holds the title of ""Gamer of the 20th Century"", as well as several record-breaking scores in classic games. Billy Mitchell's story originates in 1982 when he was named the World Champion at Centipede for his high score and then challenged the Donkey Kong champion. Mitchell, in public, set an astounding record at Donkey Kong that would be unrivaled for over 20 years. The documentary spends a few minutes interviewing Mitchell who attributes his entreprenurial success (he owns a successful restaurant chain and a business that sells hot sauce) to his passion to succeed, the same passion he applies to classic video games. In short, the interviews with Mitchell sell the viewers a portrayal of Mitchell as a seemingly arrogant man who appears to believe himself as infallible.The documentary then shifts gears as we are introduced to Steve Wiebe, a humble and likeable family man that appears to have caught several tough breaks in life. Wiebe one night sees Billy Mitchell's high score posted on the Twin Galaxies website and dedicates himself to conquering the score, which he ultimately does. He then submits the recording of him breaking the score to Twin Galaxies, the organization that recognizes, authenticates, and records high scores in classic games.From here, the documentary launches into the real meat-and-potatos portion of the film, which is the rivalry of Billy Mitchell vs Steve Wiebe in Donkey Kong. Controversy surrounds both Mitchell and Wiebe's submitted recordings, and Wiebe is drawn to an annual convention at a classic arcade spot on the east coast that encourages competitive gamers to come and attempt records in public. To Wiebe, this is an opportunity to settle the score and end the controversy. Unfortunately, more controversy ensues and Wiebe returns to the arcade some time later only to come up short. The documentary ends on a high note as a post-production note reveals that Wiebe would eventually be recognized as the record holder for the high score of Donkey Kong.What makes this documentary so compelling is the fueled rivalry between Mitchell and Wiebe. The two really couldn't be further different from each other outside of their desire to be the record-holder. Mitchell is a respected and recognized semi-celebrity that appears to have always have luck on his side and comes across as conceited, whereas Wiebe is a very humble and likeable family man with no video game pedigree whatsoever, and doesn't really appear to have a vicious fiber in his body. Despite the fact that the movie centers wholly on these two persons, they are only in the same room once in the whole film, which is nothing more than a brief encounter where Mitchell appears to rudely snub Wiebe at the arcade. This encounter, while no more than a few seconds in length, is central to summing up the attitudes of the two main characters. Wiebe calls Mitchell several times to inquire whether or not he will appear at the arcade, but never actually gets ahold of him. Wiebe asks other gamers who are friends of Mitchell whether or not Mitchell will show, and other than Mitchell's brief cameo at the arcade, he never does.The controversy reaches a fever pitch when Mitchell is on the phone with a friend at the arcade who witnesses Wiebe breaking Mitchell's Donkey Kong score in public. Wiebe enjoys a humble celebration for only one day when Mitchell submits a controversial video tape of himself breaking one million points. Twin Galaxies officially recognizes Mitchell's questionable score and Wiebe is instantly unseated as champion. This instance comes across as highly questionable in the film not only due to the screen flickering on Mitchell's recording, but also because interview footage earlier in the film have Mitchell stating that video recordings are meaningless, that the score must be demonstrated in public. Also, Wiebe had submitted a tape to Twin Galaxies earlier in the film of himself breaking one million points, but Twin Galaxies refused to recognize the score because it was on a video tape. For the most part, Twin Galaxies and even Billy Mitchell appear quite the hypocrites at this point in the film.It's hard to fault Mitchell though. Personally, I understand that the film was pushing an agenda and the rivalry and controversy does make for great entertainment. The only entities that I truly fault are Twin Galaxies and their staff. True, they are promoting a very fascinating rivalry, but they appear quite biased towards promoting Billy Mitchell as the superstar gamer while taking dubious actions towards disputing Wiebe's accomplishments. Mitchell may have acted hypocritical, but Twin Galaxies rewarded the behavior of Mitchell and unfairly punished Wiebe. On top of that, the friends of Mitchell take part in some very absurd behavior, constantly calling Mitchell and informing him of Wiebe's whereabouts and actions. At one point, they even shun Wiebe for appearing at the same restaurant they are eating at. Twin Galaxies really does look foolish for their display of childishness in the film, and official ""game referee"" Walter Day emails Wiebe an apology after Wiebe leaves. To me, this action also comes across as hypocritical as the email reads that ""Twin Galaxies apologizes for any perceived mistreatment."" Clearly, it was easier for Twin Galaxies to apologize impersonally via email as opposed to in person and after he had already returned home to Washington. On top of that, the apology is meaningless since it doesn't change the fact that Twin Galaxies did treat Wiebe, an extraordinary gamer, unfairly and like an outcast.The film comes across as very entertaining, and the personalities involved are very dynamic and interesting. Since then, a newcomer by the name of Chien has thrown his skills into the mix, but this original rivalry over the top score in Donkey Kong is remarkable and compelling.",5,When Video Games Get

1114844,AP3B615GM191G,B000XQ4HR8,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","Usually, the appeal of video games is ""man vs. machine"".  In this documentary, however, it is reconstituted as ""man vs. man"" when an arrogant old champion is challenged by an ""everyman"" competitor on perhaps the most difficult arcade game of all-time: Donkey Kong.For a basic plot summary, ""The King of Kong"" starts out with a bit of history of the Donkey Kong game, as well the rise to dominance of one Billy Mitchell, who owned the high score for more than two decades.  However, in the deep recesses of his garage, middle school science teacher Steve Wiebe begins putting together a run of his own at the high score.  The resulting conflict is between Mitchell (the egotistical, reclusive jerk) and Wiebe (just a guy who wants to be the best) played out on the arcade joystick.There are two simple reasons why this is such a great documentary:First, the nostalgia factor.  Even if you have never played a video game in your life, you have probably heard of Donkey Kong, and for those who remember it well this doc will bring back a flood of memories.Secondly, this is a human-drama story at its heart, complete with heroes, villains, and even moderators (a video game ref!) to separate the two.  Over something so trivial as a video game, a truly emotional human-interest struggle results, making you really care about the major players (one way or the other) in the end.So, while ""King of Kong"" will obviously appeal the most to hard-core gamers (especially those who grew up in that era), it can also at least be appreciate by those just looking for a compelling, fun, interesting documentary.  It has all the drama of a Hollywood production...but in real life.",5,"Turns ""Man vs. Machine"" Into ""Man vs. Man""",1325894400,"01 7, 2012",2012,1666,"['Usually', 'appeal', 'video', 'games', 'man', 'vs.', 'machine', 'documentary', 'however', 'reconstituted', 'man', 'vs.', 'man', 'when', 'arrogant', 'old', 'champion', 'challenged', 'everyman', 'competitor', 'perhaps', 'most', 'difficult', 'arcade', 'game', 'all-time', 'Donkey', 'Kong.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'King', 'Kong', 'out', 'bit', 'history', 'Donkey', 'Kong', 'game', 'as', 'well', 'rise', 'dominance', 'one', 'Billy', 'Mitchell', 'who', 'owned', 'high', 'score', 'more', 'two', 'decades', 'However', 'deep', 'recesses', 'garage', 'middle', 'school', 'science', 'teacher', 'Steve', 'Wiebe', 'putting', 'together', 'run', 'own', 'high', 'score', 'resulting', 'conflict', 'Mitchell', 'egotistical', 'reclusive', 'jerk', 'Wiebe', 'just', 'guy', 'who', 'be', 'best', 'played', 'out', 'arcade', 'are', 'two', 'simple', 'reasons', 'why', 'such', 'great', 'documentary', 'First', 'nostalgia', 'factor', 'Even', 'have', 'never', 'played', 'video', 'game', 'life', 'have', 'probably', 'heard', 'Donkey', 'Kong', 'who', 'remember', 'well', 'doc', 'will', 'bring', 'back', 'flood', 'memories.Secondly', 'human-drama', 'story', 'heart', 'complete', 'heroes', 'villains', 'even', 'moderators', 'video', 'game', 'ref', 'separate', 'two', 'something', 'so', 'trivial', 'video', 'game', 'truly', 'emotional', 'human-interest', 'struggle', 'results', 'making', 'really', 'care', 'major', 'players', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'end.So', 'King', 'Kong', 'will', 'obviously', 'appeal', 'most', 'hard-core', 'gamers', 'especially', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'era', 'can', 'also', 'least', 'be', 'appreciate', 'just', 'looking', 'compelling', 'fun', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'drama', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'real', 'life']",King of Kong:Fistful of Quarters (D/WS)
