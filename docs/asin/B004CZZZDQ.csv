1396536,AVMJOWP2ZPD2E,B004CZZZDQ,Alfredo R. Villanueva,"[0, 0]","Forget about William Holden, the barechested hunk in &#34;Picnic&#34;, or the suave hustler of &#34;Sunset Boulevard&#34;.  Meet an earlier avatar, with a flair for comedy, a great voice, and in a totally different role than those he was to play in later years.  Welcome to &#34;Father is a Bachelor&#34;, which I ran to get as soon as I had finished watching it on TV.  Basically, Holden becomes the &#34;father&#34; of five orphaned children who are trying to make it on their own. Perfect for children of all ages--5 to 75!",5,SIMPLY ADORABLE.

Holden gets away and stops and loafs near home of children trying to live on their own without people in the town knowing of their situation. Soon Holden gets caught up in taking care of these children, claiming to be a relative and handling the difficulties that arrive.
