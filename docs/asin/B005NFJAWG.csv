I'm a TV adict and TV police series fan. Spend almost all nights plugged to the dumb box. I'm too a Netflix loyal customer ever since they started in business. Well, how did I learn about this show? Not by any TV advertising or Netflix suggestion, not at all. Two months ago I was just wandering in my public library, when I came across to the 3rd disc of the 1st season. Read the DVD cover and liked. Found the 4th and 5th discs as well and took them home, since then, could not stop until last disc of season 5 (yesterday night).Is not strange that the series fly under the radar of the media targeted in the average TV/movies consumer. All reasons for that to happen are very well explained in the review Amazon shows as the most relevant.There could be as well a couple of ""politically incorrect"" items adding to that. Tough street drug criminals, merciless killers, are however predated by ""suit"" vampires: lawyers, city councilmen, contractors, real estate developers, etc. Not wonder America is sunk in probably the worst housing/mortgage crisis of history.The scene I enjoyed the most was when Omar Little and Brother Mouzone killed Stringer Bell, and to watch the city contractor/real estate shark that was feeding from Stringer, literally melting on the floor when bullets started to fly, fearing they will shoot him as well - as he surely deserves. Instead of doing so, Omar just laughed at him.Another controversial subject is the Major Colvin plan for cleaning 95% of his district streets, by concentrating all the drug dealing in three small inhabited decadent areas, a social experiment called Hamsterdam, in reference to tolerant policy about drugs in european city/port of Amsterdam. Sadly, old conservative conventional uneffective approach overcomes social innovation and drug business goes back as usual, infecting a very much larger part of city streets and residents, while police waste time and resources street chasing lowest level - foot soldier criminals.",5,"A few words from the heart about the show, not the 5 seasons package",1263945600,"01 20, 2010",2010,2171,"['saw', 'entire', '5', 'seasons', 'separate', 'want', 'give', 'opinion', 'whole', 'series', ""'m"", 'using', '5', 'seasons', 'package', 'do', 'so.This', 'series', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'underrated', ""'m"", 'TV', 'adict', 'TV', 'police', 'series', 'fan', 'Spend', 'almost', 'nights', 'plugged', 'dumb', 'box', ""'m"", 'too', 'Netflix', 'loyal', 'customer', 'ever', 'started', 'business', 'Well', 'how', 'did', 'learn', 'show', 'Not', 'TV', 'advertising', 'Netflix', 'suggestion', 'not', 'Two', 'months', 'was', 'just', 'wandering', 'public', 'library', 'when', 'came', '3rd', 'disc', '1st', 'season', 'Read', 'DVD', 'cover', 'liked', '4th', '5th', 'discs', 'as', 'well', 'took', 'home', 'then', 'could', 'not', 'stop', 'last', 'disc', 'season', '5', 'yesterday', 'night', 'not', 'strange', 'series', 'fly', 'radar', 'media', 'targeted', 'average', 'TV/movies', 'consumer', 'reasons', 'happen', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'explained', 'review', 'Amazon', 'most', 'relevant.There', 'could', 'be', 'as', 'well', 'couple', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'items', 'adding', 'Tough', 'street', 'drug', 'criminals', 'merciless', 'killers', 'are', 'however', 'predated', 'suit', 'vampires', 'lawyers', 'city', 'councilmen', 'contractors', 'real', 'estate', 'developers', 'etc', 'Not', 'wonder', 'America', 'sunk', 'probably', 'worst', 'housing/mortgage', 'crisis', 'history.The', 'scene', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'was', 'when', 'Omar', 'Little', 'Brother', 'Mouzone', 'killed', 'Stringer', 'Bell', 'watch', 'city', 'contractor/real', 'estate', 'shark', 'was', 'feeding', 'Stringer', 'literally', 'melting', 'floor', 'when', 'bullets', 'started', 'fly', 'fearing', 'will', 'shoot', 'as', 'well', 'surely', 'Instead', 'doing', 'so', 'Omar', 'just', 'laughed', 'controversial', 'subject', 'Major', 'Colvin', 'plan', 'cleaning', '95', '%', 'district', 'streets', 'concentrating', 'drug', 'dealing', 'three', 'small', 'inhabited', 'decadent', 'areas', 'social', 'experiment', 'called', 'Hamsterdam', 'reference', 'tolerant', 'policy', 'drugs', 'european', 'city/port', 'Amsterdam', 'Sadly', 'old', 'conservative', 'conventional', 'uneffective', 'approach', 'social', 'innovation', 'drug', 'business', 'back', 'usual', 'infecting', 'very', 'much', 'larger', 'part', 'city', 'streets', 'residents', 'police', 'waste', 'time', 'resources', 'street', 'chasing', 'lowest', 'level', 'foot', 'soldier', 'criminals']",The Wire: The Complete Series

It is very character driven and seemed to take very seriously the goal of showing us the dirty inside workings of many aspects of the bureaucracy.  It has plenty of violence and action to go along with some pretty deep characters that seem very real.  Not one character in the show is completely untainted, just like real people.  The show also examines morality from many different angles because it covers the criminals as unflinchingly as it covers the good guys.  Ultimately you realize that the ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" are parallels of each other in many ways.I highly recommend this series.  It's one of those that doesn't always take the formula plot direction - sometimes an outcome is foreshadowed but doesn't come to pass, and that keeps you guessing.

1495505,A2FTHCGH06O4Y5,B005NFJAWG,Caraculiambro,"[4, 16]","Would you believe I bought this entire series without ever having watched a single episode?  Such were the reviews that it had garnered (e.g., here's Wikipedia:  ""The Wire has been described by many critics as the greatest television series ever made and one of the most accomplished works of fiction of the 2000"") that I was willing to pay that hefty price sight unseen.Unlike every other 1-star reviewer here, though, I had no problems with the disks.  Probably that's because I bought mine from the U.K.  Apparently the ones sold there are outfitted with a different casing system.And though I admit the series probably deserves more than one measly star, I give it only one because I would like to be the first reviewer here to frontally attack the content of the series, not the packaging.For yes, I was disappointed.  There were aspects of excellence here and there, but on the whole I wish I had done something else with the two weeks it took me to get through this.Before I start bashing on it, though, lemme start with the one big positive this series can boast.There is one respect in which this series, while perhaps not the best series ever to have been broadcast, beats even the greats, such as ""Civilisation,"" ""Blackadder,"" ""Seinfeld,"" ""The Honeymooners,"" ""The Twilight Zone,"" ""The Singing Detective,"" etc., in one respect:Namely, all of the various episodes establish and explore a single, drumming theme:  WHY NOTHING IN THIS GOD-AWFUL CITY EVER CHANGES!Everything you see is aimed at that.  The storylines of all characters, all the plot threads, every episode, further this theme, so that by the end of the series, it's been irretrievably rammed down your throat.  Even though you might not know what they're aiming toward during certain scenes, you certainly won't leave the series as a whole wondering what the filmmakers were getting at.  The entire series coheres in a way I've never seen before, especially for such a sprawling epic.This is no mean feat, to be sure.  I think it's probably easy to single-handedly write a work of fiction that has all its various storythreads tending toward one central thesis, though interestingly even the greatest novels in English (e.g., Ulysses, Middlemarch, Moby Dick) really don't.What surely is hard, though, at least in the context of Hollywood, is keeping that vision, that theme, intact through the multifarious processes of financing and executive oversight.So that's a big plus.  I'm blown away by that.  A solemn bow to the filmmakers on that score.  Heck, even some of the greatest works of liteature (War and Peace, The Magic Mountain) don't cohere as well as this does.But I promised a negative review, so here we go:The first big negative I can think of is that, despite comprehensively convincing dialogue, the portrayal of nearly all the characters is one-dimensional.  Instead of substantial, fully-fleshed out characters, we instead have actors playing bit parts.  I've read somewhere this was intentional:  many of these actors were hired for their ability to render nothing more than a caricature.But the script also gives them bit parts, if you follow me.  They're not just character actors; they're character actors playing stock parts.Every character in this series, even the ones the script apparently imagines it's fleshing out, represents a philosophy about something, some way of thinking, without actually being 3D humans.Think of Gus in the newsroom, the embodiment of journalistic standards and probity.  But what else do you know about him?  Nothing, and nothing further is ever attempted.  This is true for virtually every character in the series.  They're not themselves, in a way; their job is simply to play a part, in the most shallow understanding of that phrase.  So for me characterization is a minus.I'm sure the writers could bark back at me, ""Are you serious?  There must be over 100 characters in that series!  All of them can't be fully rounded-out characters!""True, true, but even in cases of the more rounded-out characters, the writers had no idea what to do with them.  Consider McNulty.  They wanted him to be a kind of good detective but also a problem-with-authority kind of guy.  Beyond that, they had no idea where they wanted to take him.  Season after season sees the script not knowing what to do with him.Or Bubbles.  Those filmmakers, to this day, are probably congratulating themselves on writing Bubbles, whom they certainly imagine to be one of their most well-developed characters.Yet what insights, really, do they have into the life of a heroin addict?  Everything is so predictable and stereotyped.  I get the feeling that if I were to sit down in my garage for a half an hour I could write scenes exactly similar to all Bubbles's defining scenes using nothing more than my imagination and what I'd heard about heroin addicts on daytime television.Even the way the characters interact bears no resemblance to human behavior as I recognize it.  I've worked in many industries, some of them high-stress industries such as policework.  In my experience, people do not constantly yell at each other day in and day out every minute of the day.  Sure, there's the odd episode of flaring tempers, but, if one were to take ""The Wire"" as a guide to human interaction, one would conclude that people in every walk of life lose their temper at the drop of a dime and yell constantly, almost in preference to normally modulated speech.Actual police work is far more boring, more secretarial (not to mention dock work!). The only reason people are yelling at each other constantly in this series is simply because, on the TV screen, you've got to have constant conflict or the show will end up seeming boring.  Fine; I understand that.  That's life as a scriptwriter, dumbing down complexities.  But then how is this output being held up as an insight into human character?Even the more memorable characters suffer from believability problems.  Like I'm so sure Omar would have come back from the Caribbean.  Also, Omar himself, to begin with, was a little far-fetched.  And Snoop.  These are memorable characters; yes, but they're so reworked with artistic and multi-cultural embellishments and sensibilities that they don't really represent the kind of people that are realistically doing things like this in real-life Baltimore.  Like I'm so sure the young, unproven, and unremarkable Marlo would be heading a massive drug operation.  My guess as to what happened:  the filmmakers simply liked that kid's face and demeanor, so they alloted him the role of nefarious leader of a drug gang without the script or the characterization's ever earning it.Moreover, the script delves fearlessly into areas where it has absolutely no meaningful insights.  The docks, for example.No, wait:  Griggs is a better example.  I get the feeling the filmmakers didn't know jack squat about lesbians or gays, or at least not more than any of us know.  But they wanted to include a main gay character to be politically correct and a bit provocative.Unfortunately, watching Griggs and Omar in action (e.g., their cuddling scenes), you get the feeling you're just listening to dialogue written for straight characters that was simply grafted on to gay characters with little alteration.  Because these guys have no insight!  They should have feared to tread.Most unforgivably, all the characters in the series are all either/or.  Either a head cop is ""juking"" the stats or he's working for the good of the community.  Either a mayoral figure is corrupt and self-serving, or he's corrupt.  It's like the possibility of a complex figure --  one who is both juking the stats and yet earnestly working to improve the community -- was a contradiction that never occurred to the filmmakers.  Everyone's fate is completely one-dimensional:  Dukie ends up slamming and that's it.  Mike becomes Omar and that's that.  Namond becomes the next Roland Fryer, Jr.  Reporters are either upright or corrupt.  There's no nuance to the portrayal of humans.I believe shortcomings like this are ascribable to the fact that while the writers may possess useful insights about policing, the drug war, and the political process, their understanding of ""the human heart in conflict with itself,"" to use Faulkner's phrase, is no better than mine or yours.So let's stick with what they're good at, just to be fair.But what exactly is that?  Heck, even when the script tries for social and political insights, there's no subtlety to the core insights about government, the schools, and the police force.Let's take the schools, as just one example.  What we are taught here is that schools are ruined by the ever-present prescription to ""teach to the test.""This is largely true, but the writers evince no insight as to why such legislation was passed, or why the alternative can well be worse.But I'll tell you:  crappy teachers!  Teachers who tell their students about the time their father lost money in the stock market and claim they're teaching economics.  Teachers who avoid topics in grammar because they themselves don't understand them.  Teachers who twist history classes into political inculcation gab-fests.No, no attempt to wrestle with this problem.  Instead, the script presents everything as one-sided.  Opposing positions are comically distorted.I regard this as being no minor drawback.  One constantly hears this series as being praised for being insightful, but when you really roll up your sleeves and start peeling off the layers to get to what it's good at, you realize that it's a show that's been cobbled together by second-rate, one-sided, data-ignoring ""thinking"" about complex issues.  At times the thinking is eloquently presented, but ultimately there is no depth or fairness to conflicting viewpoints or approaches about journalism, education, law, drug legalization, etc.That program run in the basement of the school, for example, richly deserved to be cancelled.  Instead of preparing kids for high school by teaching them to write essays and do algebra, they simply sit around and talk about life in the hood?  Could you imagine if one of those students had been a young Neil deGrasse Tyson?  That kind of program gives up on the hidden promise of children . . . in advance!  No, kid's noses must be held to the fire whether or not they can see the relevance at the moment.So, at the end of the day, what do we learn about Baltimore after watching this series that you didn't know before?  Nothing reliable.  I hate to say it, but all you're left with is a general idea of what the city looks like and that there's a lot of black people living there.. . . Or wait!  Perhaps you claim that the series should be accounted great not for its insights into human character, not for its insights into the political process, but instead as an example of superb dramatic story-telling?Hold on.  While it might be true, as I say, that the series as a whole is unified by a coherent theme, individual scenes and plot points aren't.  Many of them seem to be thrown in there for shock value or to round out the hour.  There are clunky mistakes that a master dramatist would never commit:  often the pacing is awkward, the tension mismanaged, suspense fumbled, foreshadowing muddied, and - something that really got my goat -- character arcs just wander off!WHY DOES EVERYBODY HAVE SUCH A HIGH OPINION OF THIS?",1,"classic case of something that, while good, is nevertheless overrated",1333584000,"04 5,

1495514,A28JGV8PVHV3ZQ,B005NFJAWG,"EnglishMajor ""Fran""","[0, 0]","Perhaps the best police procedural series ever. Character-driven, realistic story lines (some of the funniest parts of the script are taken directly from David Simon's original non-fiction book, &#34;Homicide&#34;) & you can't beat the screenwriting (Simon, George Pelecanos, Richard Price - WOW). I particularly liked season 4, in which a detective who has been kicked from the force ends up teaching math at a city alternative school. This isn't a sweet, heartwarming &#34;Up the Down Staircase&#34; or &#34;To Sir With Love.&#34; The kids are a workout, people get hurt, not everyone succeeds, & just when the teacher is starting to get through to them, standardized testing requirements kill whatever joy there might have been in teaching or learning. I've taught in alternative schools, & this story arc was all too real.My only complaint(s) are with the DVD format. It's listed on the box as 4:3, which means that it was originally filmed for the old square screen settings, rather than for today's widescreen TVs. Depending on your DVD controller, you have two options: you can watch it in widescreen, which makes normal people appear to be about 20 lbs overweight & heavyset folks look positively grotesque; or you can watch it in a &#34;narrow&#34; setting which displays the picture in the original square screen format, where the actors' bodies appear normal but 20% of the screen on either side of the picture is blacked out. Also, the producers used locals for many of the roles, & the screenwriters wrote realistic dialogue (much of it sounds ad libbed), so it can be extremely difficult to understand what the characters are saying, both because of the Baltimore accents & because of their use of slang/jargon. I've read some reviews of the &#34;Homicide&#34; series that complain about the lack of subtitles & viewers of this series could benefit from those as well. But these are minor quibbles.

We have to say that the shipping was as expected and the product it self came in a decent box, and the DVD's were in sleeves wrapped in plastic. We have not had a chance to view all of the DVD's but so far so good.We cut the cord on cable and use our DVD collection and our Roku, and Logi Tech Revue to view T.V. We decided we were tired of the trash on paid for T.V. We realized that we were paying for local stations and could view the same channels for free if we cut the cord. We did just that and put some of our savings towards adding great shows like this to our collection.So it was a no brainier to add this item to our DVD collection. This has great actions, acting, real life reality.. If you like police drama, crime t.v. etc this is for you. Even if you don't like police drama or crime t.v. you will like this show.

You will hate the antagonists: Avon, Stringer, Nawls, Clay... and then there will be times where you alternately love and hate everyone as the series continues.You'll be introduced to new ideas, new characters, new arcs, and new styles as the series progresses.If you've seen it, you'll know of the episode where McNulty and Bunk are looking into a homicide crime scene and their dialogue consists entirely of one word.That's the one breathless word that you will exclaim when you appreciate how great this show was, and the word you will utter in disgust and fury when you realize that it never won an Emmy. I've seen ER, THE WEST WING and 24 (which I actually loved) win Best Dramatic Series, but no props for not only a show that was far superior to any single one of those shows (some farther than others) and one of the very best shows ever to grace the small screen with its existence.For quite some time, I thought honestly that ROME was going to be the best thing HBO had ever done, and while I still worship that show, THE WIRE has far and away taken the cake.",5,Hi?

Well, everyone here has said it all, so let me make this as possible and help anyone ""on the wire"" (or fence, but I tried to make a pun here...forgive!): Mr. Simon showed his genius as a writer in his grim and human portrayals of detectives and criminals in the other classic HOMICIDE LIFE ON THE STREETS back in the 1990s....if you haven't bought THAT yet, I suggest you watch it and THE WIRE will be an even more satisfying experience for you.The characters in all facets of Baltimore life are shown and fleshed out so well that it truly is a heart-stopping drama that will have you drawn in until the final season. The manner in which the series is intertwined forces you to watch from beginning to end: yes, each season could be seen as stand-alone to a casual viewer, but who could ""casually"" watch this? Like Sons of Anarchy, to truly respect the time and detail invested in creating this opus, you must watch it all. I went though this complete edition while writing my MA thesis last year, and I can say that while THE SHIELD was good, this is REAL. Compelling and brutal storyline, brilliant cast and story. I got into this show well after it ended, and it was a shame that I heard it was struggling while on the air, but that again is indicative of the society we live in that necessitates force-fed sesationalist insults to our intelligence as opposed to facing the real world for what it is, especially in a city where African Americans are the majority and left behind to fend for ourselves in the midst of violence and apathy.Get the complete series, watch, and please give your own interpretation here!",5,Utterly Brilliant Simon,1314748800,"08 31, 2011",2011,1670,"['Greetings', 'Why', 'do', 'say', 'Wire', 'fantastic', 'Well', 'everyone', 'here', 'said', 'so', 'let', 'make', 'possible', 'help', 'anyone', 'wire', 'fence', 'tried', 'make', 'pun', 'here', 'forgive', 'Mr.', 'Simon', 'showed', 'genius', 'writer', 'grim', 'human', 'portrayals', 'detectives', 'criminals', 'other', 'classic', 'HOMICIDE', 'LIFE', 'ON', 'THE', 'STREETS', 'back', '1990s', '.if', 'have', ""n't"", 'bought', 'THAT', 'yet', 'suggest', 'watch', 'THE', 'WIRE', 'will', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'satisfying', 'experience', 'you.The', 'characters', 'facets', 'Baltimore', 'life', 'are', 'shown', 'fleshed', 'out', 'so', 'well', 'truly', 'heart-stopping', 'drama', 'will', 'have', 'drawn', 'final', 'season', 'manner', 'series', 'intertwined', 'forces', 'watch', 'beginning', 'end', 'yes', 'season', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'stand-alone', 'casual', 'viewer', 'who', 'could', 'casually', 'watch', 'Sons', 'Anarchy', 'truly', 'respect', 'time', 'detail', 'invested', 'creating', 'opus', 'must', 'watch', 'went', 'complete', 'edition', 'writing', 'MA', 'thesis', 'last', 'year', 'can', 'say', 'THE', 'SHIELD', 'was', 'good', 'REAL', 'Compelling', 'brutal', 'storyline', 'brilliant', 'cast', 'story', 'got', 'show', 'well', 'ended', 'was', 'shame', 'heard', 'was', 'struggling', 'air', 'again', 'indicative', 'society', 'live', 'force-fed', 'sesationalist', 'insults', 'intelligence', 'opposed', 'facing', 'real', 'world', 'what', 'especially', 'city', 'where', 'African', 'Americans', 'are', 'majority', 'left', 'behind', 'fend', 'midst', 'violence', 'apathy.Get', 'complete', 'series', 'watch', 'please', 'give', 'own', 'interpretation', 'here']",The Wire: The Complete Series

This is one of the all time great series, but the packaging of this is the worst I've ever purchased...and I collect a lot!  I even went as far as contacting Amazon and wanted to return the series, when I just gave up and kept it realizing I was just going to wind up getting the same thing when I re-order it.  I have never in my life come across more disk skipping and portions of disks that just won't play in a DVD.  No matter if I try playing the disks on my PC or my Blu Ray player, you get multiple disk skipping in a lot of the disks.  I think it may be due to the idiotic plastic sleeves they send the disks in.  Real flimsy cheap material.  And when there's the least bit of heat, the plastic sticks to the disks.I'm trying to watch season 5 now on my pc, and so far this episode has stopped at least 10 times.  And these are brand new clean disks.  Oops, make that 12 times, no wait 13, 14, 15, crap..I give up.  Now it's stuck permanantly.What a shame.

1495537,A1P2NBM3P3TS2X,B005NFJAWG,"John S. Harris ""The Voice of Reason""","[2, 2]","Watching ""The Wire"" is like reading a really good book --- complex, layered, fully-developed characters, fleshed-out storylines with narrative arcs, etc.  The show feels very true to life:  the good guys aren't always so good, and the bad guys aren't always all bad.  The legal system is corrupt, the police and newspaper organizations are more interested in appearances than truth, the drug war isn't really a war at all, the good guys don't always win and the bad guys don't always lose.Season One primarily deals with a special police task force trying to take down Baltimore drug kingpin Avon Barksdale's organization. (The entire series is filmed and set in Baltimore, Maryland - ""bodymore murderland"").  Barksdale is an ""old school"" Baltimore gangster but his second in command, Stringer Bell, perhaps has his eyes set on greater heights for the organization than his boss will allow.  Many of the central characters we meet in this season will be featured in all five seasons.Season Two primarily deals with another special task force investigating a local dockworker's union because a high-ranking Police department official has  a personal beef with a union official.  The police official orders the task force to ""find something, anything"" on the union official or the union.  Things are complicated by a few accidental deaths and the fact that the union official really is corrupt (to a degree unbeknownst to the police official) but he's doing all these corrupt things for the right reasons (sort of).Season Three primarily deals with City Hall - corruption and backstabbing within the system, political maneuvering, a white candidate trying to unseat a black mayor in a mostly-black city, and important police investigations being compromised or shut down solely for political reasons.  Season three also sees the introduction of a new drug lord named Marlo Stanfield, a ruthless twenty-something sociopath with an elite team of enforcers backing him up.  You can't take your eyes off this guy.  He is deliciously evil but in the most understated way possible.Season Four deals primarily with the school system, its ineffectiveness, the students' lifestyle obstacles that make learning difficult or impossible, how politics impedes progress in the schools, and the toll that poverty and crime takes on the lives and futures of the children.  The lives of some of the children become intertwined with the Stanfield organization.Season Five deals primarily with the media.  An unprincipled but effective police detective manipulates crime scene evidence to fabricate a serial killer because it is the only way to get the city to pour financial resources into the police department, money he plans to use to pursue real cases he is driven to solve.  An ambitious but unprincipled reporter for The Baltimore Sun, who has a history of fabricating stories to pad his resume [based on high-profile real-life people and incidents], embellishes and fabricates elements of the story to further his career (not knowing the serial killer doesn't really exist).  His editor at the paper suspects  the reporter is turning in fraudulent stories, and when he takes his proof to management at the paper, management turns a deaf ear because they see their rising-star reporter as their ticket to a possible Nobel Prize for Public Service for the newspaper.  Layoffs and cutbacks at the newspaper further undermine the Sun's professional integrity.  ""Maybe you DO win the Nobel Prize"", says the editor who knows of the star reporter's fraudulent but popular news pieces, ""and maybe you have to give it back.""About 2 dozen central characters run through all 5 seasons, including police detectives, drug lords, street-level dealers, city prosecutors, and one especially interesting criminal character who robs drug dealers for a living.  The drug lords are probably far and away the most interesting characters in the series.  They are magnetic, charismatic, and ruthless, but perhaps no more ruthless than the red-tape and internal politics in the police department and City Hall.  Upon close examination, there really is very little difference between the business practices in the drug trade and the politics of City Hall and the Police Department.  The detectives in the Organized Crime Unit who really can devote time, energy, and resources to investigating the drug trade do so with no small sense of respect and admiration for their targets.""The Wire"" is far and away the best drama I have ever seen on television.  Best part is, it doesn't feel like a TV show.  Few of the trademark TV elements are there:  no ""bumper music "" when a scenes change, no overly expository dialogue, no stand-alone episodes where a single case gets introduced and wrapped up in the same episode, and the episode structure is different than on network TV.  On commercial network TV dramas there are carefully placed dramatic ""beats"" that are positioned right before the show cuts to commercial.  It makes the rhythm of the shows fairly predictable.  Even when watching those episodes on DVD you can sense that.  But each episode of ""The Wire"" runs a full hour with no commercial interruptions and no predictable narrative or dramatic beats.  You get to watch things unfold as the storyline logic dictates, as opposed to how a 48-minute commercial TV episode would have to unfold under time constraints.Needless to say, I highly recommend this show.  Bear in mind there is considerable adult language and some violence.  The language is so specific to the geography, professions, and cultures that one pretty much HAS to watch it with the English subtitles on in order to fully comprehend everything.  It may seem distracting at times but it definitely enhances the viewing experience.  I have watched the complete series 3 times in just under a year.  It is not unlike reading the same great novel over and over.  It might even be too good.  In the world of everyday television,  ""The Wire"" is Michael Jordan playing basketball against an elementary school team.  It's Rembrandt or Michelangelo against a bunch of fingerpainters. It's Charles Dickens against a bunch of pop-up books.  It's a game of chess versus a game of Go Fish.  It's a steak dinner against a box of McNuggets.  There's just no contest.""The Wire"" could well change the way you watch TV.  It sets the bar so high you may never look at ""regular"" TV the same way again.  Once you see how great television drama CAN be, everything else just pales in comparison.  You'll want to revisit it over and over again.",5,Quite possibly the best drama EVER.

I finally figured I'd be glad to deface the packaging to gain access to such an important story.  The first time I opened my collection to start watching it, I was incredulous to find the discs easily accessible in standard book page holders.That's the packaging.

The show starts out slow, and the pace is never really intense, minus for a few episodes/moments.  But it's easily my favorite show of all times. Every character is amazing, there's only 1 character in the show I don't like. And it's in a rooting against him kind of don't like. The acting's wonderful, I know a bunch of the other reviews probably are filled with spoilers. None here, I'll just say this Bubbles is awesome as is Omar.  There are so many moments here, I didn't watch it until after it was long off the air. But when I did, I watched all 5 seasons over maybe 3 weeks. There were days I woke up and literally watched 8 episodes in a row. Only taking a break to use the bathroom and get something to eat and drink.  Season 2 started off weird, but I'm glad I stuck with it, because it made sense and by the end was actually very good. It's obviously a drama, but it has some genuinely funny moments. Herc & Carver as partners had me laughing more than a few times. The same with Clay Davis, but at at heart of the show there's nothing at all funny here. This is what television should be, the only shame here is the show was a bit early so there's no HD or even widescreen. I would absolutely be in heaven to have an HD version of this. While the pacing may seem slow to some, it lends to near flawless character development. I'm currently in the process of re-watching it in it's entirely, which I'll probably do about once a year.

Not only is this show a trophy piece for HBO, it is probably the best television series ever created.If you are unfamiliar with the city of Baltimore, you definitely won't be after viewing this series. It tackles the hard, key points of urban society and its unfortunate decay -- from all areas in the city. The drama flows from the police departments to the streets, and from the schools to the print media. Every aspect of life is depicted on this show, which only lasted for five seasons (which, by the way, were five GREAT seasons!). The acting, writing and directing on this show is superb. There is no margin of error on this series, whatsoever.I began watching 'The Wire' exactly one year ago, and purchased the Complete Series boxed set (2008 version) from a third-party seller. Unfortunately, it was a knock-off which featured the menus and discs as though they were the authentic set. The boxed set was a brick-style case. When removing the side shield, it featured a red/black interior, and five season booklets tucked inside. Each disc contained a plastic sleeve, which was also tucked in a slit inside the season booklet. This packaging was horrible!A 2010 edition of the boxed set was released, which I recently purchased, and they changed it up a little bit. The box no longer features a light-grey complexion; it is now a dark-grey without a side shield. It also has a paper slip that covers the front, back, and sides of the set. To identify whether or not you have the new edition, which you should have, here are the things that are included in the authentic set:1.

1495555,A2BSRSOG7B2RSI,B005NFJAWG,Mr. H. C. Orr,"[3, 3]","I'll start by saying I don't generally watch TV shows. The last TV series I followed before ""The Wire"" was perhaps Season 2 of ""24"", which was obviously years ago. I'm a sceptic about TV, because watching TV in Britain it's all too common to see poor, lazy writing on shows, with mediocre acting papered over by good photography and flashy music sequences (""Holby""). ""The Wire"" has changed all that for me.It is possible to divide the world into two groups: those that say the Wire is a ""cop show"" and those that say it is a hell of a lot more than that. The first group have never seen ""The Wire""; the second group have, and are generally profoundly grateful for the experience. ""The Wire"" is simply an astonishly well-written, well-acted, masterful crime drama, a mosaic piecing together the living, breathing, bleeding city of Baltimore.What makes ""The Wire"" so great, genuinely great? Firstly, the writing and pacing are phenomenal: there's Shakespeare, Beckett and ""Citizen Kane"" at the top, but David Simon et al.'s writing is only just behind. The dialogue is sparse and as viewers of another of HBO's shows, ""Oz"" will recount, peppered liberally with swearing; but dialogue is always intelligent, and crucially grants intelligence to the disparate characters in the story.Secondly, the balance in terms of screen time is not the usual 80/20 split between cops and crooks; it is a more or less even split, making the lives of the drug dealers, traffickers and kingpins one that is allowed to breathe, grow, and mature over time. Again, the show is a crime drama, not a police show.This leads me onto my next point. The show evolves from a crime drama to a drama about a city that just happens to be enveloped in crime: for instance, we see a police man, Bresboluwski, eventually become a teacher, which gives the show a chance to portray the school system and the lives of the neighbourhood children who are on the verge of going to sell drugs on the street corners of Baltimore. The lives of the dockers in the dying city port are covered in series 2, not the usual fare for TV cop shows. The crime is simply a way into telling stories of people in Baltimore.The five series of ""The Wire"" portray in painstaking detail the struggles of a city, where expedient reasons force ordinary people to do often terrible things. I've kept this review brief because like all really great things, ""The Wire"" demands to be seen.",5,"It Lives, it breathes, it bleeds: Baltimore.",1249084800,"08 1, 2009",2009,2423,"[""'ll"", 'start', 'saying', 'do', ""n't"", 'generally', 'watch', 'TV', 'shows', 'last', 'TV', 'series', 'followed', 'Wire', 'was', 'perhaps', 'Season', '2', '24', 'was', 'obviously', 'years', 'ago', ""'m"", 'sceptic', 'TV', 'watching', 'TV', 'Britain', 'too', 'common', 'see', 'poor', 'lazy', 'writing', 'shows', 'mediocre', 'acting', 'papered', 'good', 'photography', 'flashy', 'music', 'sequences', 'Holby', 'Wire', 'changed', 'me.It', 'possible', 'divide', 'world', 'two', 'groups', 'say', 'Wire', 'cop', 'show', 'say', 'hell', 'lot', 'more', 'first', 'group', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Wire', 'second', 'group', 'have', 'are', 'generally', 'profoundly', 'grateful', 'experience', 'Wire', 'simply', 'astonishly', 'well-written', 'well-acted', 'masterful', 'crime', 'drama', 'mosaic', 'piecing', 'together', 'living', 'breathing', 'bleeding', 'city', 'Baltimore.What', 'Wire', 'so', 'great', 'genuinely', 'great', 'Firstly', 'writing', 'pacing', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'Shakespeare', 'Beckett', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'top', 'David', 'Simon', 'et', 'al', 'writing', 'only', 'just', 'dialogue', 'sparse', 'viewers', 'HBO', 'shows', 'Oz', 'will', 'recount', 'peppered', 'liberally', 'swearing', 'dialogue', 'always', 'intelligent', 'crucially', 'grants', 'intelligence', 'disparate', 'characters', 'story.Secondly', 'balance', 'terms', 'screen', 'time', 'not', 'usual', '80/20', 'split', 'cops', 'crooks', 'more', 'less', 'even', 'split', 'making', 'lives', 'drug', 'dealers', 'traffickers', 'one', 'allowed', 'breathe', 'grow', 'mature', 'time', 'Again', 'show', 'crime', 'drama', 'not', 'police', 'show.This', 'next', 'point', 'show', 'crime', 'drama', 'drama', 'city', 'just', 'be', 'enveloped', 'crime', 'instance', 'see', 'police', 'man', 'Bresboluwski', 'eventually', 'become', 'teacher', 'show', 'chance', 'portray', 'school', 'system', 'lives', 'neighbourhood', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'verge', 'going', 'sell', 'drugs', 'street', 'corners', 'Baltimore', 'lives', 'dockers', 'dying', 'city', 'port', 'are', 'covered', 'series', '2', 'not', 'usual', 'fare', 'TV', 'cop', 'shows', 'crime', 'simply', 'way', 'telling', 'stories', 'people', 'Baltimore.The', 'five', 'series', 'Wire', 'portray', 'painstaking', 'detail', 'struggles', 'city', 'where', 'expedient', 'reasons', 'force', 'ordinary', 'people', 'do', 'often', 'terrible', 'things', ""'ve"", 'kept', 'review', 'brief', 'really', 'great', 'things', 'Wire', 'be', 'seen']",The Wire: The Complete Series

Durham ""Big Evil""","[1, 1]","Forget Law & Order, C.S.I., NYPD Blue, and every single other cop or crime drama (except maybe for Homicide: Life on the Street) you've ever seen.  HBO's The Wire is single handedly the single best series, of any genre, that you have never seen, as well as being perhaps the most complex and well-written shows to ever grace television.  Created by Homicide: Life on the Street and The Corner creator David Simon, all five seasons of the The Wire are collected in this handsome box set, presenting the tales of the crime and drug-ridden Baltimore streets, as well as the dealers, cops, junkies, and everyone else caught in between.  Our main protagonist through the series is self-destructive detective Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West), but he is only one of many, many unforgettable characters that have an impact on the events of the series, as well as each other, even if they don't know it.  From drug kingpins Avon Barksdale (Wood Harris) and Stringer Bell (the smooth as silk Idris Elba), to the fearless vigilante Omar (Michael K. Williams), to junkie Bubbles (Andre Royo) to corrupt dock worker Frank Sobotka (Chris Bauer), to up and coming kingpin Marlo Stanfield (Jamie Hector), to would be mayor Tommy Carcetti (Aiden Gillen), to doomed youths Michael (Tristan Wilds) and Dukie (Jermaine Crawford); all of whom leave quite an impression on the viewer, and end up proving to be some unforgettable characters made greater by the actors playing them.  Sadly underappreciated during its run (how this show was only ever nominated for two Emmy's is beyond comprehension), The Wire can now be discovered and re-discovered for years to come.  After viewing one episode, you'll be quite intrigued, and after viewing the first season, you'll be hooked.  And most of all, you'll never be able to watch all those other crime dramas and cop shows in the same way ever again.""You gotta keep that devil, way down in the hole...""",5,The single best series that you have never seen,1229126400,"12 13, 2008",2008,1921,"['Forget', 'Law', 'Order', 'C.S.I.', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'single', 'other', 'cop', 'crime', 'drama', 'maybe', 'Homicide', 'Life', 'Street', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'HBO', 'Wire', 'single', 'handedly', 'single', 'best', 'series', 'genre', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'perhaps', 'most', 'complex', 'well-written', 'shows', 'ever', 'grace', 'television', 'Created', 'Homicide', 'Life', 'Street', 'Corner', 'creator', 'David', 'Simon', 'five', 'seasons', 'Wire', 'are', 'collected', 'handsome', 'box', 'set', 'presenting', 'tales', 'crime', 'drug-ridden', 'Baltimore', 'streets', 'as', 'well', 'dealers', 'cops', 'junkies', 'everyone', 'else', 'caught', 'main', 'protagonist', 'series', 'self-destructive', 'detective', 'Jimmy', 'McNulty', 'Dominic', 'West', 'only', 'one', 'many', 'many', 'unforgettable', 'characters', 'have', 'impact', 'events', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'drug', 'kingpins', 'Avon', 'Barksdale', 'Wood', 'Harris', 'Stringer', 'Bell', 'smooth', 'silk', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'fearless', 'vigilante', 'Omar', 'Michael', 'K.', 'Williams', 'junkie', 'Bubbles', 'Andre', 'Royo', 'corrupt', 'dock', 'worker', 'Frank', 'Sobotka', 'Chris', 'Bauer', 'up', 'coming', 'kingpin', 'Marlo', 'Stanfield', 'Jamie', 'Hector', 'would', 'be', 'mayor', 'Tommy', 'Carcetti', 'Aiden', 'Gillen', 'doomed', 'youths', 'Michael', 'Tristan', 'Wilds', 'Dukie', 'Jermaine', 'Crawford', 'whom', 'leave', 'impression', 'viewer', 'end', 'up', 'proving', 'be', 'unforgettable', 'characters', 'made', 'greater', 'actors', 'playing', 'Sadly', 'underappreciated', 'run', 'how', 'show', 'was', 'only', 'ever', 'nominated', 'two', 'Emmy', 'comprehension', 'Wire', 'can', 'now', 'be', 'discovered', 're-discovered', 'years', 'come', 'viewing', 'one', 'episode', ""'ll"", 'be', 'quite', 'intrigued', 'viewing', 'first', 'season', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hooked', 'most', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'other', 'crime', 'dramas', 'cop', 'shows', 'same', 'way', 'ever', 'again', 'got', 'ta', 'keep', 'devil', 'way', 'down', 'hole']",The Wire: The Complete Series
1495558,AIJQU979J6UFY,B005NFJAWG,"Nick ""whereishawkins""","[2, 3]","HBO deserves credit and taking a chance with a show such as The Wire. It's slow, methodical, features a heavy African-American cast - all of which aren't good for ratings. But give the show a chance, and you'll find yourself deeply enriched by the experience and realizing that the war on drugs is more complex than you've imagined.In an ensemble cast, Dominic West plays Jimmy McNulty - a self-destructive mess of a police officer who is obsessed in almost a Quixotic manner with bringing down the Barksdale family, the druglords of Baltimore's West Side. The Barksdale's aren't bad, as most shows portray drug dealers - they're almost sympathetic characters with their own code on the opposite side of the moral coin from the police. It's murky, but intriguing. McNulty's not driven by a sense of right or wrong, he's driven by the desire to prove that he's smarter than the criminals he hunts. Throughout 5 seasons, McNulty's life becomes a rollercoaster and eventually ends with a conclusion worthy of a Pulitzer Prize winning novel.Each season takes on a new target. The first season is about the Barksdale drug empire, and the attempt to bring down McNulty's version of Moby Dick - Stringer Bell. The second season takes on corruption at the Docks (in the only slowdown of the series). The third season goes back to trying to take down Stringer Bell before he becomes untouchable and fully removed from the drug trade, while Bell fends off newcomer Marlo Stanfield. The fourth season, and the most emotionally rich, takes on the topic of the failing public school systems. The fifth, and most closest to David Simon, takes on journalism. Each season has a theme, and takes it head-on and holds a mirror to these organizations and causes us to look at them in a whole new light.The show's complex with many characters that you practically need an organization chart in order to understand the layers of bureaucracy within the police department and the criminal elements. That's the strength: each of the characters are well written, and you want to know about them.The show isn't about Baltimore, and could have been portrayed in any major city in the US or even the world. The show takes on difficult topics head-on and is a slap in the face about society.If The Wire was a book, it would have won every literary prize out there.

1495565,AZ9JWGE1UGKZA,B005NFJAWG,R.A. McKenzie,"[614, 643]","Imagine a show that every critic on the planet loves.  Imagine a show so deeply layered that it makes every other drama seem simple.  Imagine a show where each character is equally important.  Imagine a show that reinvented itself every season, yet still felt like it was part of the world it created from the outset.  Imagine a show so complex that you will always discover something new the next time around.Doesn't this sound like perfection to you?  Trust me, it is, in more ways than you can fathom.THE WIRE is a show so meticulously crafted and executed that it would take me a dozen reviews to scratch the surface of what makes it great.  After catching the very first episode on HBO, I immediately bought the 1st season.  The rest, as they say, is history.I'm so afraid to ruin anything that I don't even want to give away characters' names.  To even let you go in expecting certain traits from a character would spoil the fun.  So instead, I'm deliberately being vague about what occurs.  If you've never heard about this series, you deserve go in cold.But I'll give you a few details, starting with the very first scene.  THE WIRE begins when a detective is questioning a young hoodlum who witnessed a murder.  The detective asks why the guy and his friends allowed the victim to continue rolling dice, after he'd been known to snatch the money & run.  The scene closes when the kid says, ""Got to, man.  This America.""Then the show begins its title sequence, in which The Blind Boys of Alabama's cover of ""Way Down In The Hole"" plays over a montage of seemingly random clips of police activity & urban life.  But as you'll learn the more you see this title sequence (and song), this montage is actually filled with clues, both literal and metaphorical.  The greatest crime dramas throw clues in your face without telling you how important they are.  Believe me, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, one of the greatest films of all time with its labyrinthine plot, has nothing on THE WIRE.  And we're only just getting started.What you'll also notice from the opening scene is the dialogue.  It actually took me two viewings to find out what the detective and the dice-roller were saying.  As if that wasn't enough, I eventually had to turn on the English subtitles just to find out what each character was saying.  The dialogue flows so naturally that THE WIRE never feels like a TV drama.  There are no scenes where the characters recap what happened in the previous episode, unless the characters would actually take a moment to remind each other.  This sounds like a challenge, and indeed it is.  THE WIRE requires (and deserves) your undivided attention.  Pause if you have to.  Rewind if you have to.  Use the subtitles if you have to.  Many have called THE WIRE ""a visual novel"", and they couldn't be more right.  You see how much attention I've given to just the first few minutes?  Guess what, the entire series clocks in at 63 hours.So, what's the premise of the series?  The first season's main story begins when a team of Baltimore police is assembled to take down one of the city's high-profile drug dealers.  The investigators and surveillance teams endure what real cops would endure: long hours, cold trails, bad weather, tedious paperwork, crummy offices, and worse...smart criminals.  THE WIRE gives the justice officers an equal amount of screen time as the targets they pursue.  The dealers aren't delightfully vicious or glamorous in the least.  Sort of like the Corleone Family or the protagonists in GOODFELLAS, THE WIRE portrays its criminals as guys who either can't do anything else for a living, or refuse to do anything else for a living.  The series goes even deeper, as we're engaged in the lives of judges & lawyers, homicide detectives & their office-dwelling superiors, drug kingpins & their corner workers, and even the homeless.  Calling this ""epic"" is an understatement.  If you're as interested in the urban drama as you are in the police procedural, then you're on the right track.  Don't worry, you will get to see the cops bust a few doors and arrest a few thugs, but just be aware each event it treated as ordinarily and naturally as anything else in THE WIRE.  To the characters, these events are just another day.Now bear in mind, I've only given a little info on the first season!  I won't give away any details, but Season Two continues in the exact opposite way you'd expect a sequel to.  The cops and criminals shared equal halves of TV time on Season One, but for the seasons that follow, they share equal parts with a completely new side of Baltimore.  Just wait until THE WIRE continues through its next few seasons, it gets even more deliciously complex.  If you think Season One sounds like a beastly Rubik's Cube, wait until you get a load of Season Two, not to mention the seasons afterwards.  After all, you can't predict how a single story is going to proceed if you're too blindsided by how it begins.  One of the most interesting aspects is that slowly over time, THE WIRE becomes more than a crime drama --- the series evolves into a multi-layered epic, where crime is only part of the picture.  Each of the five seasons feels like its own individual story, but naturally connects with the season that comes before and after it.I don't want you to be discouraged by this onslaught of convoluted storytelling.  There is a method to the madness.  Audiences (including me) are too used to knowing where we are at every given point of the story.  THE WIRE purposefully refrains from the kind of clarity we're used to.  This challenge that will stimulate your mind in ways that no other TV show has.  In so many ways, it's the kind of entertainment we've always wanted: Surprising yet Natural --- isn't that always the goal?THE WIRE is so great that everyone is going to take something different from it.  This show can be interpreted in a million ways.  Nobody is right, and nobody is wrong.  How can that be?  Well, creator David Simon is to be credited for this neutrality.  Simon is as hands-on as any other TV series producer, writer, or creator.  Every single aspect of the show is exactly what he wanted it to be.  THE WIRE was never the victim of a writer's strike, or cancelled seasons, or poor broadcasting schedules, or any other excuse.  If there is a character or story arc you don't care for, it isn't Simon's fault; your personal taste just doesn't mesh with it.  Sure, I have one or two nitpicks about what THE WIRE should've been in my eyes, but not once did I believe it was for a lack of focus.  For example, one particular season takes a more didactic approach to the series.  We witness moral dilemmas with an ambitious mayor, unethical cops, and newspaper staff --- all tackle the immortal question, ""Do the ends justify the means?""  This more black-and-white angle is exactly what David Simon wanted to use.  I preferred a more gray-shaded tale, but Simon decided that this tale needed a more direct statement.  Now, even though this isn't my preference, I overlooked my own criticisms because this season was built this way.  There are a couple of other little things that might not sit well with some viewers, notably how the ""star"" of the show's cast disappears for most of one season (don't worry, you'll know it's coming before it happens).  The point is that THE WIRE never once strayed from its intended path.I think that's what I'm going to take away most from this show: It tells every story it wants to tell.  It answers every question it poses, unless we're meant to ponder.  It forces us to sympathize with those we'd normally condemn, and to relate to those we'd usually ignore.  This television drama is a masterful work of art, from the page to the screen.I'm going to close with this:Despite my review title, spending a large amount of money on a complete TV series without seeing a few clips is clearly irresponsible.  I didn't type this review expecting you to drop a couple hundred by my words alone.  So, let's be sensible about this product.  If you can, rent the first few episodes from a videostore, or try to find the show in a library, or maybe even go on YouTube to find a few Season One scenes.There is so much more I want to share with you, but it's time to use a lesson David Simon taught me:I will say only enough, and make it your responsibility to discover the rest.

1495566,AXF0OX50YZQC6,B005NFJAWG,Rebecca Lyle,"[6, 6]","I just recently finished watching this series, and I must say that it is the greatest show I have ever watched in my life.  This is the type of show that needs to be watched as a whole as there are frequent tie-ins with previous episodes and you'll absolutely need to watch them in order to understand what is happening.If you're simply curious about getting into the show, there are a few things you must know.  First, this is a very intricate and detailed series.  Everything happens at an incredibly slow pace, but it is quite rewarding in the long run.  I can't wait to go back through the series to see what I may have missed.Have you ever wondered how a city is run?  Or maybe how illegal goods are imported into the country?  Maybe you've wondered what a mayor goes through to get elected or what happens behind the scenes of the Baltimore school system.  All of these questions are answered in great detail alongside an amazing narrative filled with sometimes loveable, sometimes hateable, but always in-depth characters.I have read that this series depicts these elements in an incredibly realistic manner, and the the fact that they managed to make it this entertaining is amazing.  Not only are you educated by watching, but you are emotionally involved with everything that is happening.  I know it's possible to say this about many, many shows, but I've never seen anything near the caliber of The Wire.If you're into character devolopment, look no further.  The characters are quite unique and colorful.  Omar Little, my personal favorite, is a homosexual, shotgun toting stick up man who likes to whistle nursery rhymes while performing robberies; and he's one of the good guys!  Everyone has something special going about them, even some of the lesser seen guys (Walon, etc.) are awesome to see appear and re-appear.  The charisma and the relationships shared between them is also about as good as it gets on screen.  McNulty and Bunk, two homocide detectives and obvious close friends will have many interesting drunken conversations that promise laughter.  These are just a few examples as there are many characters, and they all come and go in relevance throughout the series.Also, a lot of actual police officers, investigators, politicians, and even ex-cons lent their acting skills to the series to add even more authenticity to the characters, though most of them are small roles.Again, this is a very detailed show, so get ready to pay attention.  I can promise anyone that it pays off once you find your groove.  A friend of mine told me that he actually watched it with the subtitles on which isn't a bad idea considering the amount of slang involved; both law enforcement and street slang.As I said earlier, you're definitely going to need the entire series to fully enjoy the experience offered by this show.  I bought this particular boxed set and have had absolutely no problem with it, though some fans have been unhappy with the way this boxed set is presented.  Every season is seperated inside the box by cardboard folders that house each disc for that particular season.  It's not the prettiest way to house the 23 discs as plastic casing would probably be a safer bet, but I personally had no problems.  I haven't had a chance to watch the special features so I can't really say whether or not those are satisfying, but the show itself is enough for me given the price I paid for this.In conclusion, if you're patient, willing, and interested in this show, wait no further!

Obviously I think that The Wire is one of the best programs ever made or I would not have added it to my Amazon wish list as my highest priority item.  However, instead of heaping well deserved praise on the series I would like to review this five season box set:To begin with, it's all packaged in a box that does not readily fit in with my DVD collection unless I turn the box on it's end and then the name is not showing (I have an organized, alphabetized collection).  Inside of the box are five paper sleeves (one for each season).  They are the same size as a standard DVD case but open up horizontally instead of vertically. When you open them up each DVD is held in place by a paper divider.  This doesn't keep my discs from slipping out of their pages.  I own quite a few complete series collections and this is the least impressive packaging that I have seen for a major show.  Yes, it takes up less space than some other complete series but it doesn't look nearly as nice as most of them.As far as the Bonus Features go, there are the usual commentaries by the directors, writers and actors.  The first season has no additional specials but here are the bonus features for the remaining seasons:Season 2:  Episodic Previews and RecapAudio CommentariesSeason 3:  Q&A; with David Simon and Creative TeamConversation with David SimonSeason 4:  A Behind-the Scenes Documentary in Two Parts* ""It's All Conected""* ""The game is Real""Season 5:  The Wire: The Last Word* A Documentary exploring the role of the mediaThe Wire Odyssey* A retrospective of the first four seasonsThe Wire PrequelsFrom the Wrap PartyGag Reels...Some of these features are interesting not none approach the quality and creativity of the show itself.  The Wire is a great, wonderful, fascinating series but I think that it deserved a better presentation than this collection.  Dollar-wise this is a good value but the individual seasons seemed better packaged.  Still, it is worth buying for the content of the shows themselves.***** Five Stars for the Series*** Three Stars for this Collection",3,This rating is NOT for the series but for the box set,1247616000,"07 15, 2009",2009,2185,"['received', 'Wire', 'Complete', 'Series', 'birthday', 'recently', 'wonderful', 'series', 'great', 'gift', 'Obviously', 'think', 'Wire', 'one', 'best', 'programs', 'ever', 'made', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'added', 'Amazon', 'wish', 'list', 'highest', 'priority', 'item', 'However', 'instead', 'heaping', 'well', 'deserved', 'praise', 'series', 'would', 'like', 'review', 'five', 'season', 'box', 'set', 'begin', 'packaged', 'box', 'not', 'readily', 'fit', 'DVD', 'collection', 'turn', 'box', 'end', 'then', 'name', 'not', 'showing', 'have', 'organized', 'alphabetized', 'collection', 'box', 'are', 'five', 'paper', 'sleeves', 'one', 'season', 'are', 'same', 'size', 'standard', 'DVD', 'case', 'open', 'up', 'horizontally', 'instead', 'vertically', 'When', 'open', 'up', 'DVD', 'held', 'place', 'paper', 'divider', ""n't"", 'keep', 'discs', 'slipping', 'pages', 'own', 'quite', 'few', 'complete', 'series', 'collections', 'least', 'impressive', 'packaging', 'have', 'seen', 'major', 'show', 'Yes', 'up', 'less', 'space', 'other', 'complete', 'series', ""n't"", 'look', 'nearly', 'as', 'nice', 'most', 'them.As', 'far', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'go', 'are', 'usual', 'commentaries', 'directors', 'writers', 'actors', 'first', 'season', 'additional', 'specials', 'here', 'are', 'bonus', 'remaining', 'seasons', 'Season', '2', 'Episodic', 'Previews', 'RecapAudio', 'CommentariesSeason', '3', 'Q', 'A', 'David', 'Simon', 'Creative', 'TeamConversation', 'David', 'SimonSeason', '4', 'Behind-the', 'Scenes', 'Documentary', 'Two', 'Parts*', 'Conected', '*', 'game', 'Real', 'Season', '5', 'Wire', 'Last', 'Word*', 'A', 'Documentary', 'exploring', 'role', 'mediaThe', 'Wire', 'Odyssey*', 'A', 'retrospective', 'first', 'four', 'seasonsThe', 'Wire', 'PrequelsFrom', 'Wrap', 'PartyGag', 'Reels', 'features', 'are', 'interesting', 'not', 'none', 'quality', 'creativity', 'show', 'Wire', 'great', 'wonderful', 'fascinating', 'series', 'think', 'deserved', 'better', 'presentation', 'collection', 'Dollar-wise', 'good', 'value', 'individual', 'seasons', 'seemed', 'better', 'packaged', 'Still', 'worth', 'buying', 'content', 'shows', '*****', 'Five', 'Stars', 'Series***', 'Three', 'Stars', 'Collection']",The Wire: The Complete Series
1495576,A2XUW4IZP6UPDL,B005NFJAWG,To Be Simple,"[2, 2]","I do not suscribe to HBO. I have not watched an entire television series in over a decade. I find current and recent television to be incredibly cliche and boring. It is with that attitude that I finally caved in and bought all five seasons of The Wire. Several of my friends have been encouraging me for the past four or five years to find a way to watch this show. After seeing all the positive reviews, and getting a good price from Amazon I decided to give things a go.Other people have done a nice job of detailing what the show is about, so I will refrain from doing that in this review. What I will say is that this is the rare show/movie that actually lives up to the hype and expectations for me. In fact, it surpasses them.I got so hooked on this series that I knocked out an entire season every couple of days until I was finished with all seasons. This is addictive viewing to say the least! The acting is simply superb. The characters are generally well cast. There is humor, drama, action, suspense, etc. in each season. I honestly feel sorry for people that watched each season as they came out, episode by episode. I couldn't have stood the wait from week to week to see what happened next.What I like best about this series is that the writing is so superb. It is smart, and while it may get a bit sensationalistic at times, it is grounded in reality and makes the viewer think that they are getting an actual window into observing the characters' lives. Additionally, there is none of the clear-cut good versus evil crap that saturates most shows and movies these days. In the Wire, the good guys are sometimes very bad, and the bad guys are sometimes very good. The characters are portrayed as being very human, with nobody being perfect. It is this intricacy in character development that helps make an already interesting story even better.In closing, I highly recommend The Wire. This is coming from someone who is generally pretty cynical about television shows. There are very few shows, or movies for that matter, that have hooked me as much as The Wire.",5,Lives up to the hype,1230940800,"01 3, 2009",2009,2079,"['do', 'not', 'suscribe', 'HBO', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'entire', 'television', 'series', 'decade', 'find', 'current', 'recent', 'television', 'be', 'incredibly', 'cliche', 'boring', 'attitude', 'finally', 'caved', 'bought', 'five', 'seasons', 'Wire', 'Several', 'friends', 'have', 'been', 'encouraging', 'past', 'four', 'five', 'years', 'find', 'way', 'watch', 'show', 'seeing', 'positive', 'reviews', 'getting', 'good', 'price', 'Amazon', 'decided', 'give', 'things', 'go.Other', 'people', 'have', 'done', 'nice', 'job', 'detailing', 'what', 'show', 'about', 'will', 'refrain', 'doing', 'review', 'What', 'will', 'say', 'rare', 'show/movie', 'actually', 'up', 'hype', 'expectations', 'fact', 'them.I', 'got', 'so', 'hooked', 'series', 'knocked', 'out', 'entire', 'season', 'couple', 'days', 'was', 'finished', 'seasons', 'addictive', 'viewing', 'say', 'least', 'acting', 'simply', 'superb', 'characters', 'are', 'generally', 'well', 'cast', 'humor', 'drama', 'action', 'suspense', 'etc', 'season', 'honestly', 'feel', 'sorry', 'people', 'watched', 'season', 'came', 'out', 'episode', 'episode', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'stood', 'wait', 'week', 'week', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'like', 'best', 'series', 'writing', 'so', 'superb', 'smart', 'may', 'get', 'bit', 'sensationalistic', 'times', 'grounded', 'reality', 'viewer', 'think', 'are', 'getting', 'actual', 'window', 'observing', 'characters', 'lives', 'Additionally', 'none', 'clear-cut', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'crap', 'most', 'shows', 'movies', 'days', 'Wire', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'sometimes', 'very', 'bad', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'sometimes', 'very', 'good', 'characters', 'are', 'portrayed', 'being', 'very', 'human', 'nobody', 'being', 'perfect', 'intricacy', 'character', 'development', 'make', 'already', 'interesting', 'story', 'even', 'better.In', 'closing', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Wire', 'coming', 'someone', 'who', 'generally', 'pretty', 'cynical', 'television', 'shows', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'shows', 'movies', 'matter', 'have', 'hooked', 'as', 'much', 'Wire']",The Wire: The Complete Series

As many people have already stated, it is arguably one of the best programs ever shown. On the other hand, it portrays a gritty, brutal side of America that most people, including myself, choose to ignore and to look the other way. Meanwhile, others are condemned to live out their lives in the exact manner shown in the episodes. I cried over the corner kids and their inability to ever be children of the type I was fortunate to be. They are simply the raw material used by older men in pursuit wealth and power. The helplessness that government and the police and schools showed in attempting to address the problems are stains on the American dream.

One of those exquisite scenes is at the start of Episode 10 of the Second Season.  It is held within the few first moments --  Prez turns on the radio, and, while ""I Walk the Line"" plays on, scenes quietly pass by, and Prez continues to arrange the suspect board.  Who, I wonder, had whatever surpasses talent to do something so simple and yet so absolutely compelling in its perfection.

It can be stored vertically to save space, or horizontally to show off as a mantelpiece. As far as the special features go, there aren't any on seasons 1 or 2 other than audio commentaries. I would've liked to see more documentary behind-the-scenes features which are seen on seasons 4 and 5. Those are absolutely phenomenal, bringing you into the world of The Wire, both as a TV show and as a mirror for the city of Baltimore. The special features on season 3 are very unique (Q&A; panel of cast/crew from the Museum of Television and one David Simon guest lecture at a college), but I must admit they are somewhat boring.However, all that aside, the quality of the show itself redeems any faults. The Wire is most truly appreciated when the series is watched from start to finish. As David Simon often says, the show is like a novel which should be evaluated based on the whole product (1 season) rather than indivudal chapters (1 episode). Each character will have you hooked as they embark on amazing emotional journeys throughout these five seasons. The show sugarcoats nothing, which is a quality that may alienate some viewers of more traditional, network television. In other words, there aren't very many ""happy endings.""

The characters never try to be anything other than what they are. No bs like the closer or bones or SVU on this. The problems are real, both sides are dirty. The budget problems, racism, drugs, poverty, it all is real and makes the show that much more enjoyable. Aside from the boring 2nd season, every episode of this series was immaculate. The production of the dvd is somewhere in mexico, not the best but not the worst. But this if you love the show or love drama.
