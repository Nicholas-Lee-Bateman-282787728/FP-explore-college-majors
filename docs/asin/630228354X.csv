305693,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,630228354X,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[0, 0]","Dogfight starring River Phoenix and Lili Taylor is a film that is highly under-rated, it's one of the best films of 1991. Phoenix and Taylor's chemisty is strong and awkward but in a good way. You care about these characters and you want them to live happily ever after but Dogfight has no final resolution or fairytale ending. This film works because the people and the places are authentic, you can picture yourself being there in the turbluent 1960's. If you want a film that will leave you in awe then Dogfight is for you, this is a film you surely won't forget.

Instead, director Nancy Savoca uses such intimate depth and fragility to unearth the inner emotions at play and truly craft a believable bond and ignited (however softly) love between two very unlikely people.The film takes place is 1963.  Eddie Birdlace and his friends are preparing to get shipped off for Vietnam and are planning on taking part in a nasty little game called `Dogfight'.  Basically, men have to find and unsuspecting date to bring to a party where they will be graded on their looks and the man who brings the ugliest date gets a cash prize.  Eddie finds young Rose, a frumpy waitress who has an overbearing (or is she merely concerned) mother.  Rose is nave and sensitive and reserved and somewhat unattractive and so Eddie lays on the charm (or what he can muster) and gets her come with him.  Once she discovers what she is there for, the tables turn and the relationship between Rose and Eddie takes an unexpected turn.It's truly remarkable and beautiful to watch.This is thanks in large part to the three main players here.  Savoca's direction is so sincere, so intimate that one cannot help but be completely taken by the way she frames her characters and their situations.  The cinematography is also beautifully complimentary to the emotional themes.  Savoca works wonders with her leads as well.  River Phoenix, who was having such a great year in '91, is on the very top of his game.  He embodies Eddie with an inner struggle and adds layers of depth to him especially as the film progresses forward.  But it is Lili Taylor who steals the show and your heart.  The way her character shifts from shy and nave to convicted and aggressive is astonishing.  She never loses the insecurity that laces her every movement, but she underlines her actions with a ferocity that is unforgettable.If you are looking for a small, quiet, breathtaking departure from the frothy predictable `love stories' of the norm, then dig in to `Dogfight'; you'll be more than pleased.",5,Not as ugly as you'd expect...,1340236800,"06 21, 2012",2012,2124,"['was', 'wonderful', 'surprise', 'premise', 'sounded', 'little', 'cheesy', 'could', 'easily', 'become', 'something', 'campy', 'forgettable', 'Instead', 'director', 'Nancy', 'Savoca', 'such', 'intimate', 'depth', 'fragility', 'unearth', 'inner', 'emotions', 'play', 'truly', 'craft', 'believable', 'bond', 'ignited', 'however', 'softly', 'love', 'two', 'very', 'unlikely', 'people.The', 'film', 'place', '1963', 'Eddie', 'Birdlace', 'friends', 'are', 'preparing', 'get', 'shipped', 'off', 'Vietnam', 'are', 'planning', 'taking', 'part', 'nasty', 'little', 'game', 'called', 'Dogfight', 'Basically', 'men', 'have', 'find', 'unsuspecting', 'date', 'bring', 'party', 'where', 'will', 'be', 'graded', 'looks', 'man', 'who', 'ugliest', 'date', 'cash', 'prize', 'Eddie', 'young', 'Rose', 'frumpy', 'waitress', 'who', 'overbearing', 'merely', 'concerned', 'mother', 'Rose', 'nave', 'sensitive', 'reserved', 'somewhat', 'unattractive', 'so', 'Eddie', 'charm', 'what', 'can', 'muster', 'come', 'what', 'there', 'tables', 'turn', 'relationship', 'Rose', 'Eddie', 'unexpected', 'turn.It', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'beautiful', 'watch.This', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'three', 'main', 'players', 'here', 'Savoca', 'direction', 'so', 'sincere', 'so', 'intimate', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'completely', 'taken', 'way', 'characters', 'situations', 'cinematography', 'also', 'beautifully', 'complimentary', 'emotional', 'themes', 'Savoca', 'wonders', 'leads', 'as', 'well', 'River', 'Phoenix', 'who', 'was', 'having', 'such', 'great', 'year', ""'91"", 'very', 'top', 'game', 'Eddie', 'inner', 'struggle', 'layers', 'depth', 'especially', 'film', 'forward', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'who', 'show', 'heart', 'way', 'character', 'shifts', 'shy', 'nave', 'convicted', 'aggressive', 'astonishing', 'never', 'insecurity', 'movement', 'actions', 'ferocity', 'unforgettable.If', 'are', 'looking', 'small', 'quiet', 'breathtaking', 'departure', 'frothy', 'predictable', 'love', 'stories', 'norm', 'then', 'dig', 'Dogfight', ""'ll"", 'be', 'more', 'pleased']",Dogfight VHS
305695,A2AN5WDTIQSLWU,630228354X,Blue Leaf,"[0, 0]","I recently rewatched this film from the early 90's and appreciated it even more the second time around. Set in the mid 60s, it begins with a story about four young marines who have leave in San Francisco before being sent to Vietnam. While celebrating a night on the town they decide to have a DOGFIGHT while on leave. The rules of the DOGFIGHT were simple: everyone puts in fifty bucks and the guy with the ugliest date wins. River Phoenix stars as Cpl. Eddie (Devil Dog) Birdlace and he finds a young, shy waitress in a small cafe named Rose, played by Lili Taylor, for his date. She loves folk music but is naive when it comes to dating and men. After Rose abruptly leaves after finding out the truth about the DOGFIGHT Eddie runs after her, leaving his friends behind to spend a long evening together with her. They slowly learn about each other and escape the lonliness of their lives, at least for this one night. They both give outstanding performances and the acting along with the heartwarming story and the incredible sound of 60's folk/rock music makes this film a unique and captivating love story. San Francisco in the 60's is a dynamic character of its own, adding another creative dimension to this genuine story of falling in love during a time of immense change in the world.",5,First Love Amidst War,1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,1292,"['recently', 'rewatched', 'film', 'early', '90', 'appreciated', 'even', 'more', 'second', 'time', 'around', 'Set', 'mid', '60s', 'story', 'four', 'young', 'marines', 'who', 'have', 'leave', 'San', 'Francisco', 'being', 'sent', 'Vietnam', 'celebrating', 'night', 'town', 'decide', 'have', 'DOGFIGHT', 'leave', 'rules', 'DOGFIGHT', 'were', 'simple', 'everyone', 'fifty', 'bucks', 'guy', 'ugliest', 'date', 'wins', 'River', 'Phoenix', 'Cpl', 'Eddie', 'Devil', 'Dog', 'Birdlace', 'young', 'shy', 'waitress', 'small', 'cafe', 'named', 'Rose', 'played', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'date', 'folk', 'music', 'naive', 'when', 'dating', 'men', 'Rose', 'abruptly', 'finding', 'out', 'truth', 'DOGFIGHT', 'Eddie', 'leaving', 'friends', 'spend', 'long', 'evening', 'together', 'slowly', 'learn', 'other', 'lonliness', 'lives', 'least', 'one', 'night', 'give', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'acting', 'along', 'heartwarming', 'story', 'incredible', 'sound', '60', 'folk/rock', 'music', 'film', 'unique', 'captivating', 'love', 'story', 'San', 'Francisco', '60', 'dynamic', 'character', 'own', 'adding', 'creative', 'dimension', 'genuine', 'story', 'falling', 'love', 'time', 'immense', 'change', 'world']",Dogfight VHS
305696,A1ME8I7QU6DWIB,630228354X,"Bridget Niki ""yoga, chemistry, but mainly chi...","[4, 4]","Wow!  I love the setting, the research, the growth, the story told in this movie.  You see Birdlace, a Marine, choose Rose as his date for the dogfight.  The Marines are shipping out to Vietnam the next day so they are letting loose.  Birdlace half heartedly tries to dissuade Rose from sticking it out but Rose will have none of that!  When Rose finds out what the party really is, she lets Birdlace have it (you learn in the audio commentary that the particular scene I'm talking about was their FIRST take).  Birdlace asks for Rose's forgiveness and the bulk of the movie takes you through his last night in the States with Rose.  Spanning from the 60s to the 70s, we also see how the culture has changed.  Contrasted with the rigid 60s, Birdlace comes back to a 70s America where a lot has changed.  You'll either love the ending or not.  I suggest if you have a hard time swallowing the ending, listen to the audio commentary!  This DVD has the type of audio commentary I love.  The director talks about the motives, the 'symbolism', and the research, and the quirky little facts. The director and the producer talk about what is really going on ... what the characters might be thinking.  I would give the commentary itself a 5/5 stars!More things I liked:- the awkward love scenes.  Instead of cutting and fast forwarding to the 'good' stuff, she (the director) makes you go through every painful moment of it.- The transformation of River Phoenix's Birdlace character throughout the movie.  He is your typical cussing sailor who turns into this quiet, stoic type by the end.- Rose's character.  Even though she is the victim of this dogfight, she never acts pitiful but still plays this hopeful, fragile, naive character.- Birdlace's military friends.  They are these minor characters, but they still are independent round characters with personality and thought put into their story lines.- In the audio commentary, the director notes that Birdlace represents the harsh reality of things and Rose is the idealistic hopeful one.  Even though they have these opposite viewpoints, you believe them both.  So true.  The commentary also notes the dress Rose wears to the dogfight (which, when she gets prepared for it is one of my favorite parts of the movie) is this puffy, yellow thing where Rose looks almost like a fluffy duckling and she's going into this dogfight where the guys have different intentions ... These are the types of things you learn in the commentary!  Very informative.There are just so many small things that make this movie incredibly believable.",4,look for the brendan fraser cameo!,1229558400,"12 18, 2008",2008,2575,"['love', 'setting', 'research', 'growth', 'story', 'told', 'movie', 'see', 'Birdlace', 'Marine', 'choose', 'Rose', 'date', 'dogfight', 'Marines', 'are', 'shipping', 'out', 'Vietnam', 'next', 'day', 'are', 'letting', 'loose', 'Birdlace', 'half', 'heartedly', 'dissuade', 'Rose', 'sticking', 'out', 'Rose', 'will', 'have', 'none', 'When', 'Rose', 'out', 'what', 'party', 'really', 'Birdlace', 'have', 'learn', 'audio', 'commentary', 'particular', 'scene', ""'m"", 'talking', 'was', 'FIRST', 'take', 'Birdlace', 'Rose', 'forgiveness', 'bulk', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'States', 'Rose', 'Spanning', '60s', '70s', 'also', 'see', 'how', 'culture', 'changed', 'Contrasted', 'rigid', '60s', 'Birdlace', 'back', '70s', 'America', 'where', 'lot', 'changed', ""'ll"", 'either', 'love', 'ending', 'not', 'suggest', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'swallowing', 'ending', 'listen', 'audio', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'type', 'audio', 'commentary', 'love', 'director', 'talks', 'motives', ""'symbolism"", 'research', 'quirky', 'little', 'facts', 'director', 'producer', 'talk', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'what', 'characters', 'might', 'be', 'thinking', 'would', 'give', 'commentary', '5/5', 'stars', 'More', 'things', 'liked', 'awkward', 'love', 'scenes', 'Instead', 'cutting', 'fast', 'forwarding', ""'good"", 'stuff', 'director', 'go', 'painful', 'moment', 'it.-', 'transformation', 'River', 'Phoenix', 'Birdlace', 'character', 'movie', 'typical', 'cussing', 'sailor', 'who', 'quiet', 'stoic', 'type', 'end.-', 'Rose', 'character', 'Even', 'victim', 'dogfight', 'never', 'pitiful', 'still', 'hopeful', 'fragile', 'naive', 'character.-', 'Birdlace', 'military', 'friends', 'are', 'minor', 'characters', 'still', 'are', 'independent', 'round', 'characters', 'personality', 'thought', 'put', 'story', 'lines.-', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Birdlace', 'harsh', 'reality', 'things', 'Rose', 'idealistic', 'hopeful', 'one', 'Even', 'have', 'opposite', 'viewpoints', 'believe', 'So', 'true', 'commentary', 'also', 'dress', 'Rose', 'dogfight', 'when', 'prepared', 'one', 'favorite', 'parts', 'movie', 'puffy', 'yellow', 'thing', 'where', 'Rose', 'almost', 'fluffy', 'duckling', 'going', 'dogfight', 'where', 'guys', 'have', 'different', 'intentions', 'are', 'types', 'things', 'learn', 'commentary', 'Very', 'informative.There', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'small', 'things', 'make', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'believable']",Dogfight VHS

I don't know how they were able to make this movie so touching, so human and so funny when the subject matter, on the surface, is so offensive.  The scenes with Eddie's three best buddies are filled with youthful male humor---vulgar, crude and immature--- yet it rings so true and really is just plain hilarious.  You love these guys.  They don't know where they're going when they ship out, but they're together and nothing else matters.  And the friendship that develops between Eddie and Rose also rings completely true.I like the way the ""ugly"" girl turns out to be so witty and interesting and how the cute guy, over the course of the night, is so affected by her.  The whole movie is just a wonderful surprise.  From beginning to end.  I still laugh whenever I think of one of the guys looking for ugly girls at the bus station and finding Miss Two Bears.

305698,A2PBV1899CX3TE,630228354X,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 0]","Dog Fight is a charming little movie, surprisingly sensitive for such an ugly subject. Eddie Birdlace (River Phoenix) is a young marine who will soon be shipping out to Viet Nam. A marine tradition is to have a dog fight, a contest to see who can get the ugliest girl to come to a party. Eddie asks Rose (Lili Taylor) but then regrets it when he starts to like her. While in the Ladies Room she overhears that she is in a dog fight, and tells him off, trying to salvage what little dignity remains. He follows her home, and in spite of getting off on the wrong foot, convinces her to go out with him. He is a young and callow jerk, but she refuses to be mistreated. There is a funny scene in a restaurant where she gives as good as she gets to drive home her point that he swears too much. Can't print the quote, but you get the idea.The movie takes place in 1963, and the two characters mirror the schism that was tearing our country apart. She is much more politically aware, if perhaps a bit too idealistic and naive. She is listening to Joan Baez and such.I just read up on River Phoenix, and he was a remarkable man. He died tragically of a drug overdose outside Johnny Depp's Viper Room on Sunset Blvd. He was brought up by an unusual family who belonged to a religious cult, but perhaps could better be described as hippies. River had numerous friends who were really shaken by his death. They are actors and directors, and many musicians from all over the world. I mention this merely because to see him in Dog Fight, he really becomes a young gung ho marine with little idea of what Viet Nam has in store for him.Lili Taylor has carved out quite a career for herself playing the kind of deep, brooding artists that may not be the cutest but are certainly the most profound girls in the room. She is married to a poet, Nicky Flynn, who navigates between the worlds of theater and poetry effortlessly. He seems perfect for her, and I wish them both much happiness.River PhoenixSneakers(1992) .... Carl Arbegast was portrayed by River Phoenix.My Own Private Idaho(1991) ....

His untimely death ended a career that would have blossomed even more over time.In Dogfight, Phoenix play the part of Birdlace with honesty and emotion. You think of the character as a complete jerk to begin with, then realize that the marine does have a soft heart for ugly-duckling Rose. You're then again disappointed when he rips up her address and tosses out the window of a moving bus as he and his fellow marines head to Viet Nam. For those who haven't seen it, I won't reveal the final scene. Instead, I will say that it is truly touching. Both Phoenix and Taylor delve into the characters of Birdlace and Rose, a perfect pair for this film. Their quiet moments together had me feeling the intensity, something that I admire. Not every actor is able to do that.I feel like this film should have received more recognition when it was released. Then again, Phoenix wasn't about recognition and was more about doing films he believed in. Fans of this movie saw the same special qualities that River saw; the development of the characters made you care for them even when they were in the wrong and the story was so bittersweet and realistic that you could have seen something like that actually happening during that confusing and delicate time in history.For some, River will always be missed and we will always wonder what might have been.

It serves as an expose of machismo in it's most phony and cruel forms.  There is also a pacifistic message that runs through it with the nascent conflict in Vietnam in the background.  Director Nancy Savoca weaves these themes passionately into the narrative but doesn't bludgeon the point.  See this film for the heartbreaking final scene for nothing else.

The winner gets the money the entrants put together. I actually knew someone in college who took part in one of these, and I remember thinking that he was a real loser.Eddie chooses Rose to be his entry in this contest, and she eventually catches on to what he's done and gives him a piece of her mind and storms off into the night.But Eddie feels remorse for what he subjected Rose to, and he also realizes that he actually likes her and after a comically botched apology back at her house, the two go out on the town and have a whirlwind romance.That's it except for the bittersweet coda where Eddie returns home from Vietnam broken by his wounds and loss of his friends and falls weeping into Rose's welcoming arms.&lt;spoilers end>Like I said this movie has three flaws that undermine it:1.  The film asks us to believe Rose is an unattractive woman because she is fat.  The thing is, Lili Taylor is not a fat person and the ""fat suit"" she wears in the movie is really obvious.  They should have come up with some other stratagem to make her look dowdy because she looks faintly ridiculous in that get up.2.  Eddie is presented as a ""good guy"" once he realizes he likes Rose.  But when he was apologizing to her, he happened to comment that he had taken part in six other dogfights before meeting her.  Taking repeated part in such events goes beyond being just a little immature and insensitive, and I think that an admission like that would hardly make Rose think to herself, ""Yup, he's a keeper!!""3.  Finally, the film takes willing suspension of disbelief to the breaking point and beyond in that it shows Rose going from justifiably furious at Eddie and his pals for treating women so badly to being ""in love"" with him to the point of sleeping with him ... all in the span of just a few hours (and this was fifty years ago when people even in San Francisco were a lot less casual about sex).  I could have bought the idea of them reconciling and falling in love over a week or even a few days, but the idea that they would have become lovers so quickly after such a disastrous introduction was absurd.  And what would it say about a woman who had so little self esteem that she'd be willing to sleep with the guy who she felt humiliated her and a lot of other women just a few hours after the dogfight took place?My criticisms shouldn't be taken as a warning not to see the movie.

305716,A1V5JPGVZB7POK,630228354X,mfaromantic,"[8, 11]","I got sucked into this movie on IFC last night and was very glad I did. I was reminded just what a compelling and talented actor River Pheonix was and couldn't help feeling sad at various points throughout the film about our loss of his brilliance. Lili Taylor played her character beautifully. Despite her meek, unassuming, and shy manner, her strength shone through and she did not allow Eddie to intimidate her or cause her to back away from her ideals.As many other reviewers have noted, this film does a wonderful job of capturing the sweetness and the awkwardness of young and new love. I loved the contrast between Eddie's night with Rose and that of his buddies raucous, hollow ramblings.Where I found the movie lacking was at the end. It felt a little too contrived and formulaic for me, especially in light of the rest of the film and it's attempt to show the illusions of both characters, their extreme difference in view points, and the development of these fledgling new identities that we can only really guess at in the final scene. So much is revealed to us in the subtle scenes and conversations they share in their night together and yet at the end we are only shown one scene from Eddie's experience in Vietnam and must guess at who they have both become and what it is that brings them back together. In addition, there was some very interesting commentary on the United States - its culture and foreign policy - that I think is highly relevant today. This element was very much overshadowed by the love story and I think deserved more focus.Despite this, I still very much enjoyed it and would recommend it if not only to see these two great actors in a moving story.",3,I wanted so much more,1156896000,"08 30, 2006",2006,1688,"['got', 'sucked', 'movie', 'IFC', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'very', 'glad', 'did', 'was', 'reminded', 'just', 'what', 'compelling', 'talented', 'actor', 'River', 'Pheonix', 'was', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'sad', 'various', 'points', 'film', 'loss', 'brilliance', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'played', 'character', 'beautifully', 'meek', 'unassuming', 'shy', 'manner', 'strength', 'shone', 'did', 'not', 'allow', 'Eddie', 'intimidate', 'cause', 'back', 'away', 'ideals.As', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'film', 'wonderful', 'job', 'capturing', 'sweetness', 'awkwardness', 'young', 'new', 'love', 'loved', 'contrast', 'Eddie', 'night', 'Rose', 'buddies', 'raucous', 'hollow', 'ramblings.Where', 'found', 'movie', 'lacking', 'was', 'end', 'felt', 'little', 'too', 'contrived', 'formulaic', 'especially', 'light', 'rest', 'film', 'attempt', 'show', 'illusions', 'characters', 'extreme', 'difference', 'view', 'points', 'development', 'fledgling', 'new', 'identities', 'can', 'only', 'really', 'guess', 'final', 'scene', 'So', 'much', 'revealed', 'subtle', 'scenes', 'conversations', 'share', 'night', 'together', 'yet', 'end', 'are', 'only', 'shown', 'one', 'scene', 'Eddie', 'experience', 'Vietnam', 'must', 'guess', 'who', 'have', 'become', 'what', 'back', 'together', 'addition', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'United', 'States', 'culture', 'foreign', 'policy', 'think', 'highly', 'relevant', 'today', 'element', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'overshadowed', 'love', 'story', 'think', 'deserved', 'more', 'focus.Despite', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'would', 'recommend', 'not', 'only', 'see', 'two', 'great', 'actors', 'moving', 'story']",Dogfight VHS
305717,A20NJAPECFGIR9,630228354X,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[11, 11]","This film is one of my favorites. I have enjoyed a lot of River's roles but none like the lovesick marine he plays in Dogfight. He and Lili Taylor have excellent chemistry that makes this the perfect date film.The film starts with Eddie Birdlace AKA Birdlegs ( Phoenix ) reminiscing about the night before he left for the Vietnam war. We learn about his three marine friends who help him form the Four B's. The last night before they leave they embark on a traditional girl hunt called &quot; Dogfight &quot;. The object is to find the ugliest woman you can find and bring her to the marine's dance so she can be judged on. If your date is the ugliest, you win money. Sounds cruel? Well it is. Anyway, Eddie finds quiet, innocent slightly plump and unique-looking Rose ( Lili Taylor ) at her mother's diner. He's attracted to her singing more than her figure. He ropes her into accepting his invitation to the dogfight. Seeing how Rose doesn't have many dates she jumps at the chance to be with the handsome marine. At the dance Rose learns of the horrible reason Eddie invited her. Eddie makes it his mission of the night to apologize. By this time he really likes her. She allows him to take her for a night on the town in which the two fall hopelessly in love. They end the night very romantically and Eddie leaves to hook up with the other B's so they can leave for the war.This movie is one of the most touching I have ever seen. It drug out many emotions. I was angry at how cruel Eddie could be, but at the same time I felt sorry for him. I realized he didn't know any better. The turning point was how Rose was able to show him that his faults may not have been visible as hers, but were actually worse. The acting was wonderful. Lili and River did a great job and they fit the parts beautifully. Taylor is always a breath of fresh air and is one of the most underrated film stars. This is another movie that saddens River fans because unfortunately he is no longer with us. Dogfight was River's best film in my opinion. It's a love story that tugs at your heart and opens your eyes. It's a film for everyone to enjoy. And for the record, Lili Taylor is prettier than most. The sad thing about this film is that &quot; dogfights &quot; are real. But this movie allows the culprits to see how their victims feel.  Lili Taylor is a true winner in this one.

I think the actors did a great job conveying the awkwardness of what falling in love is all about. While Lili Taylor is not ugly at all, I like the idea of an ""ugly girl"" getting the guy without changing herself. She stayed true to herself until the very end. Speaking of which: The ending, in my opinion, is one of the most perfect endings I've seen for a movie - hands down. I don't really have much else to add except to say that Dogfight is a gripping love story and you will think about it long after the film is over.
