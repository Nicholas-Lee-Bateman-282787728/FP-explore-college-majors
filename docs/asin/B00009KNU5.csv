Ritter ""Petercrissgirl72""","[0, 0]","I first caught this show on Directv but the showings were sporadic...I really wanted to be able to watch it and really give it a chance. I looked for it on DVD and luckily it's available! I am hooked on this show. It is probably hands down the funniest show I have ever watched. Part of the allure is the down-to-earth characters on the show, yeah they all have their unique idiosyncrasies and maybe are not typical ""upstanding, proper citizens"" but you can definitely relate to them. Ricky is so much fun to listen to and watch...He always screws up words...like ""denial and error"". You will love each character...Julian, Bubbles, Ricky, Mr. Lahey, Randy, J-ROC and his ""crew""...and of course Trevor and Cory. You have the ladies mainly Lucy and Sarah and they are as trailer trashy as the rest! This show is somewhat like RENO 911 but I think funnier. This was a top-rated cable show in Canada for 7 years so something must have been right! There are 7 seasons, as well as a Christmas Special and I believe 2-3 other movies.

After doing a marathon and watching almost everything in about a week I had to write a review saying watch this series. If you're a fan of offbeat comedies and uncomfortable moments and ridiculous things being said by characters to show will have you rolling on the floor.Some amazing Rickyisms:One man's garbage is another man person's good ungarbage.It's Clear to See Who Makes the Pants HerePlutonium LoveshipYou might wanna just get this box set:TRAILER PARK BOYS - SEASON 1 - 7Then each season is only $11 bucks.  You still need to buy the movies but you should save about $20.Watching the ""Christmas"" special before season 5 (It in all respects is a prequel to the whole series. Also watch ""The Big Dirty"" movie after season 6I'll save you an explanation as to what the show is about and let you know that you want to focus on Ricky and Jim as the characters that say some super memorable stuff. What I love so much about the show is the way Ricky comes off as ""unintelligent"" but in a very sincere and funny way. I love it when he mispronounces a word and you have to sit there for a second try to figure out what word he actually meant, it's golden. And the park supervisor Jim as some of the best lines as a ""bad guy"" you'll ever hear. He takes the S word and uses it in such an artfully cunning way your mind will actually be blown.The show is just funny on so many levels and I think is on par with The Office in its early years. And while it does get repetitive in some of the story arcs it still is quality seven seasons later. I hope you've enjoyed reading this as much as I enjoyed watching it but in all reality there is no freaking way that's even possible.Thanks for reading!PS my only complaint is that there aren't very many episodes per season.

Like the original ""The Office"", ""Trailer Park Boys"" shows up in mock reality style and there the similarities end. The first two seasons exhibit that sort of newness and surprise that makes for priceless entertainment. The story lines, characters and their interactions are almost hard to believe. What can you say about a show with a character named Ricky telling his best friend Julian ""I love Lucy"" after Lucy has made a pass at Julian? Or Bubbles making his living by restoring stolen shopping carts and, when facing jail time, asks the sincere and poignant question, ""Who's gonna look after my kitties""? As preposterous as the people and the situations become, the lads hold it all together with flawless comic logic that usually ends in hilarious parodies of typical TV style, not unlike South Park's addiction to ""I learned something today ..."" closings. But of course, no-one has or ever will learn a thing. Unapologetically lovable and offensive adventures in love, friendship, gunfights, growing dope and getting drunk.

Everything he causes to go wrong becomes somebody else's fault through his warped rationalization. He's uselessly wise about his own stupidity. It's a thing of beauty to behold! He's constantly setting up people with Knock Knock jokes that don't actually follow the Knock Knock rhythm just so he can tell people to f*** off. Each time he does this, I laugh harder than the last time! Rob Wells plays this character to the hilt and is the true comedic genius driving this entire show, in my opinion.Julian is the straight man/tough guy/brains of the outfit. He comes off as seeming more intelligent but it's only because he has more poise. He's almost as stupid as Ricky. It does not matter what is going on, to include action scenes, Julian is NEVER without his rum and Coke, ice tinkling in the glass. It kills me!Something is clearly dysfunctional about Bubbles in a fundemental fashion, and yet he is the most intelligent citizen in the park. He passionately curses non-stop in a way as natural to him as taking the next breath. His blisteringly foul language often pops up in the most benign of situations causing the funny quotient to leap upwards.There's a guy who never wears a shirt, wears too tight white pants, has a huge belly, and there's no explanation given, ever, for why he's like this.The ""Bottle Kids"" randomly appear to smash bottles on people's windshields or homes, while the people are there, and this is an accepted part of life in the park.

Officially the first reality television show to air on national television, ""Cops"" pandered to the prurient in all of us, the urge to see willful stupidity and irrational rage played out in all of its seamy, accidentally-comedic glory.  ""Cops,"" now 18 years old, still plays, eternally banking on society's fascination with train wrecks, especially when those trains are run by boozed, baked, and bewildered boobs.  Well, move over ""Cops.""  If you thought real-live redneck morons could make for arresting television (pun intended), take a look at what Mike Clattenburg has done with the wonderful world of make-believe.A mockumentary of Canada's Sunnyvale Trailer Park and its hopelessly clueless citizens, ""Trailer Park Boys"" owes as much to Reiner'sThis Is Spinal Tapas it does to ""Cops.""  Like ""Spinal Tap,"" the show follows three short-sighted dopes around as they try to make sense of their lives, mend strained relationships among those they love, and -- of course -- try out any number of hair-brained (and mostly illegal) schemes to make money fast.Bubbles is ostensibly the smartest (he quotes Aristotle and Plato ... with accuracy!) and most sensitive of the trio, a cat lover who gets caught up in the shenanigans if for no other reason than because he values loyalty over intelligence and friendship over freedom.  Julian, a well-built man who is always seen in a black baby-t, is the only one of the three who harbors dreams beyond his small life in the trailer park.  Rarely seen without a drink in hand, Julian is a smart man, but not smart enough to disengage himself from the chaotic orbit of Ricky, a truly crazy, dumb, dangerous, dumb, well-meaning, and just very, very dumb man.If it weren't for the almost flawless acting, the show could very well be consider nothing more than a protracted and horribly foul-mouthedThree Stoogesepisode (with a littleJackassthrown in for flavor).  However, with the exception of a few characters (Sam Losco, a former veterinarian, is the one that comes immediately to mind), the actors and actresses in this show are truly, and without exaggeration, dead-on in every scene.  If it weren't for the ludicrous circumstances and the fact that the camera work steadily loses its shaky, documentary feel over the years, it would be very easy indeed to believe that these are real people.  (Adding to the faux-autheticity, whenever the actors make live public appearances, they always remain steadfastly in character.)Season One introduces us to the gentlemen, Ricky and Julian, as they are finishing up an eighteen month stint in jail.  They return to their beloved trailer park, but immediately encounter resistance (and will for the rest of the seasons) in the form of the trailer park supervisor, Mr. Lahey, and his half-naked assistant, Randy.  In addition, Ricky must deal with his dwindling relationship with Lucy (with whom he's fathered a daughter, Trinity), while Julian takes on the new trailer park hotshot, Cyrus.  Somewhere in there a kindly old woman's dog eats some suspicious brownies, an undeniably white rapper -- J-Roc -- tries to earn money in the amateur adult video industry, and a robbery at a local grocery store goes horribly, hilariously wrong.  The Second Season expands the characters, giving us a more thorough look at Bubbles (his affinity for felines and exactly how he makes his money), Cory and Trevor (lapdogs who are to Julian and Ricky what Rosencrantz and Guildenstern were to King Claudius), and Mr. Lahey and Randy (the nature of their symbiotic relationship is explored in disturbing detail).If it sounds dirty, distasteful, stupid, and weird, it kinda is.  But the nicely contained cosmos of the trailer park, the perfectly defined characters, the psychologically-sound ties that bind every person in the park together, and the (as I said before) amazing acting make this show not just hilarious, but also ground-breaking and brilliant.  For most TV series, that would be high praise, but when you're talking about drugged-up, trash-talking Moe, Larry, and Curly, it's a recommendation of the highest order.",5,Garbage Art and Flawless Fools,1176854400,"04 18, 2007",2007,4190,"['Long', 'before', 'Survivor', 'Big', 'Brother', 'Amazing', 'Race', 'was', 'Cops', 'right', 'Officially', 'first', 'reality', 'television', 'show', 'air', 'national', 'television', 'Cops', 'pandered', 'prurient', 'urge', 'see', 'willful', 'stupidity', 'irrational', 'rage', 'played', 'out', 'seamy', 'accidentally-comedic', 'glory', 'Cops', 'now', '18', 'years', 'old', 'still', 'eternally', 'banking', 'society', 'fascination', 'train', 'wrecks', 'especially', 'when', 'trains', 'are', 'run', 'boozed', 'baked', 'bewildered', 'boobs', 'Well', 'move', 'Cops', 'thought', 'real-live', 'redneck', 'morons', 'could', 'make', 'arresting', 'television', 'pun', 'intended', 'take', 'look', 'what', 'Mike', 'Clattenburg', 'done', 'wonderful', 'world', 'make-believe.A', 'mockumentary', 'Canada', 'Sunnyvale', 'Trailer', 'Park', 'hopelessly', 'clueless', 'citizens', 'Trailer', 'Park', 'Boys', 'as', 'much', ""Reiner'sThis"", 'Is', 'Spinal', 'Tapas', 'Cops', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'show', 'three', 'short-sighted', 'dopes', 'try', 'make', 'sense', 'lives', 'mend', 'strained', 'relationships', 'love', 'course', 'try', 'out', 'number', 'hair-brained', 'mostly', 'illegal', 'make', 'money', 'fast.Bubbles', 'ostensibly', 'smartest', 'Aristotle', 'Plato', 'accuracy', 'most', 'sensitive', 'trio', 'cat', 'lover', 'who', 'caught', 'up', 'shenanigans', 'other', 'reason', 'loyalty', 'intelligence', 'friendship', 'freedom', 'Julian', 'well-built', 'man', 'who', 'always', 'seen', 'black', 'baby-t', 'only', 'one', 'three', 'who', 'harbors', 'dreams', 'small', 'life', 'trailer', 'park', 'Rarely', 'seen', 'drink', 'hand', 'Julian', 'smart', 'man', 'not', 'smart', 'enough', 'disengage', 'chaotic', 'orbit', 'Ricky', 'truly', 'crazy', 'dumb', 'dangerous', 'dumb', 'well-meaning', 'just', 'very', 'very', 'dumb', 'man.If', 'were', ""n't"", 'almost', 'flawless', 'acting', 'show', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'consider', 'nothing', 'more', 'protracted', 'horribly', 'foul-mouthedThree', 'Stoogesepisode', 'littleJackassthrown', 'flavor', 'However', 'exception', 'few', 'characters', 'Sam', 'Losco', 'former', 'veterinarian', 'one', 'immediately', 'mind', 'actors', 'actresses', 'show', 'are', 'truly', 'exaggeration', 'dead-on', 'scene', 'were', ""n't"", 'ludicrous', 'circumstances', 'fact', 'camera', 'work', 'steadily', 'shaky', 'documentary', 'feel', 'years', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'easy', 'indeed', 'believe', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'Adding', 'faux-autheticity', 'whenever', 'actors', 'make', 'live', 'public', 'appearances', 'always', 'remain', 'steadfastly', 'character', 'Season', 'One', 'gentlemen', 'Ricky', 'Julian', 'are', 'finishing', 'up', 'eighteen', 'month', 'stint', 'jail', 'return', 'beloved', 'trailer', 'park', 'immediately', 'encounter', 'resistance', 'will', 'rest', 'seasons', 'form', 'trailer', 'park', 'supervisor', 'Mr.', 'Lahey', 'half-naked', 'assistant', 'Randy', 'addition', 'Ricky', 'must', 'deal', 'dwindling', 'relationship', 'Lucy', 'whom', 'fathered', 'daughter', 'Trinity', 'Julian', 'new', 'trailer', 'park', 'hotshot', 'Cyrus', 'Somewhere', 'kindly', 'old', 'woman', 'dog', 'suspicious', 'brownies', 'undeniably', 'white', 'rapper', 'J-Roc', 'tries', 'earn', 'money', 'amateur', 'adult', 'video', 'industry', 'robbery', 'local', 'grocery', 'store', 'horribly', 'hilariously', 'wrong', 'Second', 'Season', 'characters', 'giving', 'more', 'thorough', 'look', 'Bubbles', 'affinity', 'felines', 'exactly', 'how', 'money', 'Cory', 'Trevor', 'lapdogs', 'who', 'are', 'Julian', 'Ricky', 'what', 'Rosencrantz', 'Guildenstern', 'were', 'King', 'Claudius', 'Mr.', 'Lahey', 'Randy', 'nature', 'symbiotic', 'relationship', 'explored', 'disturbing', 'detail', 'dirty', 'distasteful', 'stupid', 'weird', 'nicely', 'contained', 'cosmos', 'trailer', 'park', 'perfectly', 'defined', 'characters', 'psychologically-sound', 'ties', 'bind', 'person', 'park', 'together', 'said', 'amazing', 'acting', 'make', 'show', 'not', 'just', 'hilarious', 'also', 'ground-breaking', 'brilliant', 'most', 'TV', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'high', 'praise', 'when', ""'re"", 'talking', 'drugged-up', 'trash-talking', 'Moe', 'Larry', 'Curly', 'recommendation', 'highest', 'order']",Trailer Park Boys: Season 1-2

Still, it reminds me a bit of what is swept off of the cutting room floor of a skit comedy.

753783,A2TP4A79ZRVTHV,B00009KNU5,Orphan of Sickness,"[0, 0]","Season 1 - 4 starsSeason 2 - 5 starsWell, this is the start of Canada's trademark cult series, a mockumentary of life in a trailer park located in Nova Scotia. While the show has become a personal favorite, the first season was a bit rough and underdeveloped, but at the same time, it is still an important part to the storyline. Two ex-convicts, Ricky and Julian, are fresh out of jail following the events that took place in the rare black and white Trailer Park Boys feature full-length. Both of them are doing what it takes to get back on their feet, whether it would be dealing with the gun toting Cyrus, starring in a grease film just to make money to start off a hydroponics operation (which quickly backfires), or even doing a little break and enter just to have a successful proposal. Trailer park supervisor Jim Lahey and his shirtless assistant Randy don't make things any easier for the two. The thing I've noticed about this season in particular is that it's more dark in tone, having Ricky and Julian constantly arguing and disagreeing with each other when it comes to their set goals and outcomes. While I still think it's not one of my favorite seasons of the show, it's still a great season to start things up. Besides, the last episode of the first season makes it worthwhile to keep watching towards the second season...Season two feels more developed, with the ideas fleshed out better and by utilizing the cat loving Bubbles much more to bring out its own personality. Ricky is even funnier than ever with his use of ""Rickyisms"", and Julian comes off as less selfish. The main objective of this season involves a business strategy called ""Freedom 35"", a mass grow and sell operation to approach retirement. The Boys must deal with the trailer park turning into a mess due to a conflict in Lahey and Randy's relationship, spider mites infesting their plants, Lahey's daughter who takes a liking to Ricky (played by Ellen Page of Juno and Inception fame), and even con artists masquerading as Bible sales people, just to name a few. This also brings out the veterinarian Sam Losco in a negative light, who lost his license due to events in the first season, who threatens to take control over Sunnyvale. The season as a whole comes off as much less dark in its nature and more comedy based (which the show would keep following down that same approach), and with the use of clever dialog and awkward situations done even better than before, it's very obvious that this was the point that the show was something that would make an imprint in comedy television.Even though the second season is done better than the first, it is still highly recommended to watch this show from front to back, starting off with the first season. It may be a bit slow to absorb it all in, but by the time the second season is on its way, it finally hits like a firecracker and you have no choice but to keep watching throughout the Boys' crazy adventures.",5,The formulative beginnings,1362268800,"03 3, 2013",2013,2952,"['Season', '1', '4', 'starsSeason', '2', '5', 'starsWell', 'start', 'Canada', 'trademark', 'cult', 'series', 'mockumentary', 'life', 'trailer', 'park', 'located', 'Nova', 'Scotia', 'show', 'become', 'personal', 'favorite', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'bit', 'rough', 'underdeveloped', 'same', 'time', 'still', 'important', 'part', 'storyline', 'Two', 'ex-convicts', 'Ricky', 'Julian', 'are', 'fresh', 'jail', 'following', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'rare', 'black', 'white', 'Trailer', 'Park', 'Boys', 'feature', 'full-length', 'are', 'doing', 'what', 'get', 'back', 'feet', 'would', 'be', 'dealing', 'gun', 'toting', 'Cyrus', 'starring', 'grease', 'film', 'just', 'make', 'money', 'start', 'off', 'hydroponics', 'operation', 'quickly', 'even', 'doing', 'little', 'break', 'enter', 'just', 'have', 'successful', 'proposal', 'Trailer', 'park', 'supervisor', 'Jim', 'Lahey', 'shirtless', 'assistant', 'Randy', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'things', 'easier', 'two', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'season', 'particular', 'more', 'dark', 'tone', 'having', 'Ricky', 'Julian', 'constantly', 'arguing', 'disagreeing', 'other', 'when', 'set', 'goals', 'outcomes', 'still', 'think', 'not', 'one', 'favorite', 'seasons', 'show', 'still', 'great', 'season', 'start', 'things', 'up', 'last', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'keep', 'watching', 'second', 'season', 'Season', 'two', 'feels', 'more', 'developed', 'ideas', 'fleshed', 'out', 'better', 'utilizing', 'cat', 'loving', 'Bubbles', 'much', 'more', 'bring', 'out', 'own', 'personality', 'Ricky', 'even', 'funnier', 'ever', 'use', 'Rickyisms', 'Julian', 'off', 'less', 'selfish', 'main', 'objective', 'season', 'business', 'strategy', 'called', 'Freedom', '35', 'mass', 'grow', 'sell', 'operation', 'approach', 'retirement', 'Boys', 'must', 'deal', 'trailer', 'park', 'turning', 'mess', 'due', 'conflict', 'Lahey', 'Randy', 'relationship', 'spider', 'mites', 'infesting', 'plants', 'Lahey', 'daughter', 'who', 'liking', 'Ricky', 'played', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Juno', 'Inception', 'fame', 'even', 'con', 'artists', 'masquerading', 'Bible', 'sales', 'people', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'also', 'out', 'veterinarian', 'Sam', 'Losco', 'negative', 'light', 'who', 'lost', 'license', 'due', 'events', 'first', 'season', 'who', 'take', 'control', 'Sunnyvale', 'season', 'whole', 'off', 'as', 'much', 'less', 'dark', 'nature', 'more', 'comedy', 'based', 'show', 'would', 'keep', 'following', 'down', 'same', 'approach', 'use', 'clever', 'dialog', 'awkward', 'situations', 'done', 'even', 'better', 'before', 'very', 'obvious', 'was', 'point', 'show', 'was', 'something', 'would', 'make', 'imprint', 'comedy', 'television.Even', 'second', 'season', 'done', 'better', 'first', 'still', 'highly', 'recommended', 'watch', 'show', 'front', 'back', 'starting', 'off', 'first', 'season', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'slow', 'absorb', 'time', 'second', 'season', 'way', 'finally', 'firecracker', 'have', 'choice', 'keep', 'watching', 'Boys', 'crazy', 'adventures']",Trailer Park Boys: Season 1-2
