1141227,A2S0DU8QTQSKWK,B0013D8LLS,Brendon Spencer,"[1, 1]","and poor ol' Peter (Reece Shearsmith) is one of them. The guts of the story is a kidnapping gone terribly, terribly wrong. Or very, very funny, depending on which side of the screen you happen to be on. The brothers, David (Andy Serkis) and the reluctant Peter have kidnapped the step-daughter of a rich mafia type. Under normal circumstances you'd think she would be more than a tad upset. Instead she's totally ticked off and not afraid of anything, including her captors. Jennifer Ellison plays the -- I was going to say 'victim', but quite honestly, anyone in her sphere of influence is the victim, not her. While I do recommend this movie, obviously from the 4 stars I gave it, be aware the girl does have a mouth on her, meaning a LOT of foul language. She uses at least one word constantly that I am personally uncomfortable with, but at the same time she's cracking me up.To start with, the kidnapping is about the only thing they do half-way right. From then on it's a disaster. The brothers, both, are fine actors and get into their characters in such a way they are totally believable. The kidnapee, Tracy, also is a winner. Without giving away the plot, we manage to go from a crime comedy to a...really strange twist in that it turns into a horror movie.SPOILER ALERT: The only fault I found in the movie was the ending. I really hated it. There were so many directions in which it could have gone, that would have been so much better.

1141229,AI75DMXPK6SD1,B0013D8LLS,CannibalxKorps,"[1, 1]","This Brittish horror comedy starts out as a botched kidnapping for the first half of the film. It starts with two brothers(David and Peter) kidnapping the daughter of a gangster and taking her to a cabin out in the woods. They ask for a ransom of 100 thousand which is brought to them by the girl's stepbrother(Andrew) who is also in on the kidnapping. However he failed to check the case the money was supposed to be in and realizes it was empty after reaching the cabin. Meanwhile the gangster was aware of the stepbrothers involvement and sends two asian hitmen after them. The first half of the film plays out more like a black comedy and a thriller. Peter is shown to be incompetent in his task and ends up getting his nose broken by the girl using a headbutt on him while being tied up. Peter also has a severe case of moth phobia shown through several humorous scenes of him freaking out in the presence of a moth. The stepbrother Andrew is shown to be a complete moron by not checking the suitcase for money and also buying himself a facemask that doesn't even cover his face.David drives over to a nearby town to call the gangster and demand his money. While he is in town the first signs of a horror film start to show. The townsfolk act strangely around him and warn him about what happens to strangers in the area. David returns to the cabin to find only Andrew fainted with Peter and the girl gone. At this point it would look like the two hitmen were responsible but are later shown to be only a red-herring as a body with a slit-throat of one of them is found. David and Andrew and Peter and the girl each encounter the real killer of the film, a deformed backwoods farmer that stalks them for the rest of the film. The plot twist in the middle of this film can be compared to ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" with a hostage thriller quickly turning to a vampire film except in this it quickly turns into a hillibilly slasher type film.While this no ""Dead Alive"" as far as blood and gore there are some good bloody kills in the movie and the gore level rises a lot in the second half. A difference this film has from other backwoods slasher films like ""Wrong Turn"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is that the killer didn't become the way he is from inbreeding or radiation like in the other films. The Farmer was deformed in a machine accident that ended up disfiguring his face.The idea of a a backwoodsman going on a killing spree isn't exactly otiginal but this movie is different enough from the usual to not make it tired or cliche.

1141233,A364W6U6YL219D,B0013D8LLS,"Craig Edwards ""Media Guy""","[0, 0]","The Cottage (2008) This comedic horror flick has a couple of Brit brothers named David (Andy Serkis-Gollum himself!) and Peter (Reece Shearsmith-Shaun of the Dead) who have the bright idea of kidnapping a local London gangster's daughter named Tracey (Jennifer Ellison-Phantom of the Opera '04). Things quickly go awry when they take her to a tiny cottage out in the boonies, mostly due to Peter, a spectacularly inept kidnapper. Eventually Tracey escapes with Peter as her prisoner, leaving David and another accomplice to pursue them into the countryside. Unfortunately they end up on a farm owned by a psychotic disfigured local serial killer and they all really start having a lousy evening. Throw in some slapstick, a couple of Asian hitmen, a few off kilter villagers, some sharp implements and some very graphic violence and you end up with this movie, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Mixing humor and horror can be tricky, but this movie manages it deftly, keeping the situations serious but letting the characters be funny. The whole cast is solid, but Serkis is really good, keeping his exasperation on a solid boil at all the really dim people around him. The makeup effects are top notch and the whole shebang is well orchestrated by director Paul Andrew Williams (London to Brighton).

1141234,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0013D8LLS,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[10, 14]","From the shores of the UK comes yet another hilariously gruesome horror comedy that more than takes the piss out of anything Hollywood could ever come up with.  That being said, though, the old clich&eacute; does apply: you'll either love it or hate it.  Personally, I thought it was bloody brilliant, especially in the way it kept the dark comedy coming even after it shifts from ""bumbling criminal comedy"" to ""disfigured madman slasher"" mode.  Andy Serkis is just fantastic as the heavy whose simple kidnapping plan goes horribly, horribly wrong thanks to his incompetent partners.  Reece Shearsmith plays the whiny wanker to the hilt, Steven O'Donnell chips in mightily as a complete idiot, and Jennifer Ellison makes each of her scenes memorable, largely by way of her liberal use of adult language (some complain about her over-use of the ""c-word,"" but it's not like this movie is being marketed to children, for Pete's sake).  The legendary Doug Bradley also appears (all too briefly), and that's a pretty big deal to horror aficionados like myself.  As for Paul Andrew Williams, let me just say that he is a great writer/director; this may only be his second feature-length film, but I would say he's already graduated from ""up and coming"" to the big time.You would think the hardest part of any kidnapping would be the actual kidnapping itself, but that's already been done as The Cottage opens its doors to the audience.  In this case, though, the actual kidnapping is the only thing the kidnappers manage to get done properly (or at all).  Poor David (Andy Serkis) finds his plans ruined time and time again by his partner - and brother - Peter (Reece Shearsmith).  Peter, unlike his brother, just isn't cut out for a life of crime, as he proves time and again.  The man is deathly afraid of moths, for heaven's sake, so he's no match at all for Tracey (Jennifer Ellison) once she wakes up.  The daughter of some kind of local goon, she's spit-in-your-eye and cuss-you-out tough.  Once she starts holding forth in that grating Cockney accent of hers, it soon becomes clear why the kidnappers are only asking one hundred thousand pounds for her return.  She strikes me as a sort of Cockney Britney Spears.I won't go in to the laundry list of stupid mistakes that doom the kidnapping plot, but each one of them makes for great comedy.  The actors work really well together, showing great comedic timing throughout, thanks in no small part to Serkis' ability to play the heavy in such a convincing manner.  Much of it may be predictable, but it's still funny.  Then, about midway through the film, some viewers might be wont to say that they went to a dark comedy and a horror movie broke out.  The Cottage may well lose some of its audience here, as it does take its mutilation and murder seriously (in other words, there will be blood and gore), but this horror fan really ate it up.  Even underneath all of the blood and body parts, the comedic elements are still there; heck, there's even a poignant little moment of brotherly bonding at one point.  Of course, you've also got the proverbial dash of bitter irony thrown in for good measure, and a fairly successful attempt by writer/director Paul Andrew Williams to ""leave `em laughin.'""Some might say that The Cottage doesn't know whether it wants to be a comedy or a slasher.

Wilson ""SonRisedInTheEast""","[24, 27]","With titles like Shaun Of The Dead, Severence, Evil Aliens, and Botched being sparkling examples of the horror/comedy genre AND all coming to us from Great Britain, it should come as no real surprise that The Cottage fits in so well with the rest of those films.  Enter polar-opposites(and brothers) David and Peter; stuck in the middle of nowhere and involved in a kidnapping gone awry that includes a captive that refuses to go quietly, a pair of Asian assasins, an obese partner in crime that can do little right(my favorite character too), bizarre townsfolk(with a guest spot by Pinhead himself, Doug Bradley!), and of course, when things seem like they can't get any worse, a demented and deformed maniac!  Now for the kind of dry humor and wit used here, you need a great cast, and Andy Serkis(The Prestige, King Kong) and Reece Shearsmith(Shaun Of The Dead, The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy) as the lead protagonists are fantastic... whether it's bouncing quips off of eachother, or interacting with the rest of the ecclectic characters that they run into throughout the night.  As far as deformed killers go, ""the farmer"" is a definite keeper!  He's the same basic mold as a hundred gruesome, semi-retarded, cruel and twisted(with canibalistic urges) madmen that horror fans have come to expect... but he looks and acts the part perfectly, and actually features the best looking(and by that I mean ugliest) clump of flesh for a head that I've seen in quite awhile!  The direction is excellent and I really enjoyed the musical score(which sounds like it was cut for a Tim Burton film rather than this); in the end, I'd even go as far as to say this is my favorite of all the aforementioned films listed at the top of the review... bold statement I know, but give it a chance and see what you think(at the worst you'll get a few laughs and a decent helping of grue).  As a bonus, if you do dig the film as much as I do, the DVD features a ton of quality deleted scenes and outtakes(some so good that it makes you wonder why they were removed?) that are more than worth seeing.  *VIEWERS ATTENTION*  Make sure and wait until the credits finish rolling before turning the movie off... there's a nice added surprise at the very end.",4,Enjoy some blood clottage at The Cottage!,1211760000,"05 26, 2008",2008,2239,"['titles', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'Severence', 'Evil', 'Aliens', 'Botched', 'being', 'sparkling', 'examples', 'horror/comedy', 'genre', 'coming', 'Great', 'Britain', 'should', 'come', 'real', 'surprise', 'Cottage', 'fits', 'so', 'well', 'rest', 'films', 'Enter', 'polar-opposites', 'brothers', 'David', 'Peter', 'stuck', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'involved', 'kidnapping', 'gone', 'awry', 'captive', 'go', 'quietly', 'pair', 'Asian', 'assasins', 'obese', 'partner', 'crime', 'can', 'do', 'little', 'right', 'favorite', 'character', 'too', 'bizarre', 'townsfolk', 'guest', 'spot', 'Pinhead', 'Doug', 'Bradley', 'course', 'when', 'things', 'seem', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'worse', 'demented', 'deformed', 'maniac', 'Now', 'kind', 'dry', 'humor', 'wit', 'used', 'here', 'need', 'great', 'cast', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'Prestige', 'King', 'Kong', 'Reece', 'Shearsmith', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'Galaxy', 'lead', 'protagonists', 'are', 'fantastic', 'bouncing', 'quips', 'eachother', 'interacting', 'rest', 'ecclectic', 'characters', 'run', 'night', 'As', 'far', 'deformed', 'killers', 'go', 'farmer', 'definite', 'keeper', 'same', 'basic', 'mold', 'hundred', 'gruesome', 'semi-retarded', 'cruel', 'twisted', 'canibalistic', 'urges', 'madmen', 'horror', 'fans', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'part', 'perfectly', 'actually', 'best', 'looking', 'mean', 'ugliest', 'clump', 'flesh', 'head', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'awhile', 'direction', 'excellent', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'musical', 'score', 'was', 'cut', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'film', 'rather', 'end', ""'d"", 'even', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'say', 'favorite', 'aforementioned', 'films', 'listed', 'top', 'review', 'bold', 'statement', 'know', 'give', 'chance', 'see', 'what', 'think', 'worst', ""'ll"", 'get', 'few', 'laughs', 'decent', 'helping', 'grue', 'bonus', 'do', 'dig', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'DVD', 'ton', 'quality', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'outtakes', 'so', 'good', 'wonder', 'why', 'were', 'removed', 'are', 'more', 'worth', 'seeing', '*VIEWERS', 'ATTENTION*', 'Make', 'sure', 'wait', 'credits', 'finish', 'rolling', 'turning', 'movie', 'nice', 'added', 'surprise', 'very', 'end']",The Cottage

That is one of the best combos of all time and I wish more films like this were being made. This is a really fun flick that I am sure any one who watches it would enjoy; so far every one I know liked it. Looking at the case you would think this is a straight horror movie but this is more so a comedy more than any thing with some great performances.David and Peter are brothers on a mission and that mission is getting money from a powerful gangster by kidnapping his daughter. Also involved in this scheme is her brother Andrew who botches the money exchange by not checking the bag. From here David storms off not noticing the hit men that are outside who followed Andrew. When he returns Andrew is knocked out and his brother is missing, as is their hostage. Little do any of them know that a disgustingly burned crazed farmer killer is on the loose and they are headed towards his place. I am sure you can see were this movie is going, every one heading to a bloody doom. What you may not expect is how funny this film is, intentionally.These films are rare indeed with the ""Evil Dead"" series being the best as far as these kinds of films go but this film is actually really good. Writer/director Paul Andrew Williams did a great job with this film crafting a very entertaining film. His humor I guess matches mine because I thought this film was hilarious, and his direction is on point. Also did I mention that the deaths and gore in this film are also very good. Got to love when some one pulls your head off and drags it on the ground still connect to you spinal cord, Mortal Combat style ""oops e"".All the performances are great starting with Andy Serkis as David, this dude is insanely good in this film. And with Reece Shearsmith as Peter they are perfect together as brothers; this dude is very funny in this one. Jennifer Ellison is hilarious as Tracey and is very very mean in this, poor Peter. Steven O'Donnell plays her brother Andrew and is wonderful in this film; all of these people interact very well with each other. The entire cast is very well cast and in my opinion is perfect in this film. Ever one in this is good though including the guy who plays the killer, he is not a pretty guy at all, of course he is burned all over.This is a very fun film at least to me with all of the blood and guts and violence that takes place but it is the humor that really makes this film shine. With a very likable cast and a cool killer this is a winner for sure, to be honest I am surprised that is didn't do better. If you like surprise endings you will definitely like this one here, although I am sure some will see it coming but it is still a nice way to end things.

1141246,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0013D8LLS,Mark Turner,"[2, 2]","Let me say up front that for me this could be one of my favorite films of the year. It offers something unseen before, twists a genre on its ear and has more laughs than most highly touted big studio comedies have offered in years. That being said lets get to the plot.David (Andy Serkis) and Peter (Reece Shearsmith) are brothers who are attempting to pull of a kidnapping. David works for a high level thug and sees an opportunity. Peter is a milk toast who bows to the pressures of his wife and sees a chance to get ahead. Neither of them gets what they want.The kidnapped in question is Tracey (Jennifer Ellison), a foul mouthed spitfire who takes no guff from anyone least of all two inept kidnappers. Each opportunity that presents itself to do damage to either one she takes. Unfortunately for Peter, the more inept of the two, that means he suffers considerably from beginning to end.They hapless pair have Tracey holed up in a cottage in the country. This setting is far from anything, including people, making it the perfect place to stow the victim. Well, victim isn't a great term to use for Tracey because she pretty much controls any and everything as we progress.  After a mishap with David's cell phone, he goes to town to use the pay phone. While there, he is warned by the strangest looking group of townsfolk you have ever seen to stay in his house.The gags in this film move from sight gags to situational comedy that hits the mark every time. Toss in another member of the kidnappers who screws things up past the point of no return (and who offers a laugh that forced me to pause the DVD) and you have a great comedy.BUT...it's not just a comedy. No, if you paid attention to the cover work on the shelf you caught a glimpse of some spooky looking character. Yes, this is a horror film as well! You get two movies for the price of one!Eventually, do to Peter's bumbling, Tracey escapes with Peter in tow. Searching for the nearby town, Tracey leads them to a farm that at first seems abandoned. But the more they walk through, the more aware they become of an evil presence that lives there. And when they confront the grotesque figure of the home's owner, it offers a scare and a laugh at the same time.The movie shifts into a different gear as we've changed from simple kidnap story to horror icon land. The home is owned by a farmer who went mad years ago and who now stalks the countryside. With Tracey and Peter captured, we now get to see David and his fellow cohort try to find and then rescue them. Instead, more mayhem ensues. And when the thug's henchmen get into the picture it's even more hilarious.I know, I know, the movie doesn't sound funny at all. But that's because to reveal some of the funniest parts would be to ruin it for the viewer. Suffice to say that so much damage to one person has never been nearly as funny. It's like an entire season of FUNNIEST HOME VIDEO damage clips rolled into one person.At the same time, the movie offers some of the goriest horror scenes put on film in some time. Enough so this movie would not be one I'd recommend for children. For adults though you shouldn't deny yourself the chance to see this funny film. Laughs and scares in equal measure make this one of the most original and best films of the year.",5,CRIME DOESN'T PAY,1214524800,"06 27, 2008",2008,3285,"['Let', 'say', 'up', 'front', 'could', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'year', 'something', 'unseen', 'before', 'genre', 'ear', 'more', 'laughs', 'most', 'highly', 'touted', 'big', 'studio', 'comedies', 'have', 'offered', 'years', 'being', 'said', 'lets', 'get', 'plot.David', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'Peter', 'Reece', 'Shearsmith', 'are', 'brothers', 'who', 'are', 'attempting', 'pull', 'kidnapping', 'David', 'high', 'level', 'thug', 'opportunity', 'Peter', 'milk', 'toast', 'who', 'pressures', 'wife', 'chance', 'get', 'ahead', 'what', 'want.The', 'kidnapped', 'question', 'Tracey', 'Jennifer', 'Ellison', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'spitfire', 'who', 'guff', 'anyone', 'least', 'two', 'inept', 'kidnappers', 'opportunity', 'do', 'damage', 'one', 'Unfortunately', 'Peter', 'more', 'inept', 'two', 'considerably', 'beginning', 'end.They', 'hapless', 'pair', 'have', 'Tracey', 'holed', 'up', 'cottage', 'country', 'setting', 'far', 'anything', 'including', 'people', 'making', 'perfect', 'place', 'stow', 'victim', 'Well', 'victim', ""n't"", 'great', 'term', 'use', 'Tracey', 'pretty', 'much', 'controls', 'everything', 'progress', 'mishap', 'David', 'cell', 'phone', 'town', 'use', 'pay', 'phone', 'there', 'warned', 'strangest', 'looking', 'group', 'townsfolk', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'stay', 'house.The', 'gags', 'film', 'move', 'sight', 'gags', 'situational', 'comedy', 'mark', 'time', 'Toss', 'member', 'kidnappers', 'who', 'screws', 'things', 'up', 'point', 'return', 'who', 'laugh', 'forced', 'pause', 'DVD', 'have', 'great', 'comedy.BUT', 'not', 'just', 'comedy', 'No', 'paid', 'attention', 'cover', 'work', 'shelf', 'caught', 'glimpse', 'spooky', 'looking', 'character', 'Yes', 'horror', 'film', 'well', 'get', 'two', 'movies', 'price', 'one', 'Eventually', 'do', 'Peter', 'bumbling', 'Tracey', 'Peter', 'tow', 'Searching', 'nearby', 'town', 'Tracey', 'farm', 'first', 'abandoned', 'more', 'walk', 'more', 'aware', 'become', 'evil', 'presence', 'there', 'when', 'confront', 'grotesque', 'figure', 'home', 'owner', 'scare', 'laugh', 'same', 'time.The', 'movie', 'shifts', 'different', 'gear', ""'ve"", 'changed', 'simple', 'kidnap', 'story', 'horror', 'icon', 'land', 'home', 'owned', 'farmer', 'who', 'went', 'mad', 'years', 'ago', 'who', 'now', 'countryside', 'Tracey', 'Peter', 'captured', 'now', 'get', 'see', 'David', 'fellow', 'cohort', 'try', 'find', 'then', 'rescue', 'Instead', 'more', 'mayhem', 'ensues', 'when', 'thug', 'henchmen', 'get', 'picture', 'even', 'more', 'hilarious.I', 'know', 'know', 'movie', ""n't"", 'sound', 'funny', 'reveal', 'funniest', 'parts', 'would', 'be', 'ruin', 'viewer', 'Suffice', 'say', 'so', 'much', 'damage', 'one', 'person', 'never', 'been', 'nearly', 'funny', 'entire', 'season', 'FUNNIEST', 'HOME', 'VIDEO', 'damage', 'clips', 'rolled', 'one', 'person.At', 'same', 'time', 'movie', 'goriest', 'horror', 'scenes', 'put', 'film', 'time', 'Enough', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'one', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'children', 'adults', 'should', ""n't"", 'deny', 'chance', 'see', 'funny', 'film', 'Laughs', 'scares', 'equal', 'measure', 'make', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'best', 'films', 'year']",The Cottage

Serkis and Reece Shearsmith play feuding brothers David and Peter who have kidnapped the daughter of a strip club owner.  They've taken their hostage Tracey (Jennifer Ellison) out to a remote cottage and from there, everything that can go wrong does.  Tracey doesn't make things easy on her witless captors...she's loud, foulmouthed, and frankly scares the hell out of timid Peter.Complicating matters is their befuddled accomplice and Tracey's half brother Andrew, who has led the boss's hitmen straight to the trio.  The three and their hostage soon find themselves on the run through the wilderness, taking refuge at nearby farmhouse.  Things go from bad to worse as they soon find out the farm is home to an ax-wielding cannibal who has just sharpened all his farm tools for his next meal.The Cottage is a surprisingly fun little film.  While it is thrilling and filled with generous amounts of blood and gore, a requisite for any good slasher film, it never lets it's comedy elements stray too far away.  Horror comedies often turn out as campy spoofs but this is anything but campy.  The shock elements and the kills made by the enormous, disfigured killer are just as terrifying as in any horror film but director Paul Andrew Williams cleverly manages to sneak in droll bits of humor when you least expect it.  Ellison is a riot as the buxom, mouthy hostage, who is more than a match for her captors.  Her four-letter tirades allow her to steal just about any scene where she is not gagged.Serkis, who has lent his name to various film and video game projects, finally gets to shine in a starring role in front of the camera.  As David he projects a pretense of the tough guy mastermind but with a genuine love for his hen-pecked brother.  He shows a range far beyond just doing voice-over roles.  Shearsmith is equally enjoyable as nervous and whiny Peter, always giving into his brother but eventually proving that he is strong and resourceful.  Their scenes together early in the film as they argue over things from their childhood are some of the best in the film.  It's almost a shame when the caper film turns into the horror film.  If there is a weakness it is that the film does take a bit of time to develop and move itself along to the horror portion of the film.The Cottage is clever and doesn't take itself too seriously although horror fans won't be disappointed.  The slasher elements are better than you see in a lot of low budget films and frankly better than those in some big budget horrors.

The movie starts with two brothers having kidnapped the daughter of a rich man.  The plan quickly went south as the two were proven incompetent.  To make the matter worst, a killer lurked in the woods.  The movie takes a good hour to build the characters into well rounded people.  When killer appeared, we empathize with their plights however ridiculous they might be.  The kills were simple yet effective.  One or two will make the squeamish to cover their eyes.The Cottage is possibly the best in the 4 or 5 Dimension Extreme titles that I have viewed.
