Beginning with Julianne Nicolson and Christopher Meloni, both from the Law and Order series, and throwing in Timothy Hutton from the big screen, it was too interesting to pass up! The icing on the cake was John Krasinski who is Jim from the Office.Julianne's character is wounded and hurt by her boy friend (Krasinski) and so she obtains permission from her professor to take on a project of interviewing various men. Her goal is to learn how men think and why they treat women the way they do! The information she obtains is a mixture of painful truths, obvious lies, possible fantasies, sincere adoration of women, and devious mixed messages!  Krasinski, who was also the director delivered one of the tougher monologues to his former girlfriend. I found him to be convincing as a rather insensitive character. In fact, the cast were very good, but I do think the film needed a little more editing because it did drag a few times.",3,-------Quirky and entertaining in an off-beat way------,1269043200,"03 20, 2010",2010,1037,"['film', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'actors', 'associated', 'husband', 'decided', 'needed', 'see', 'Beginning', 'Julianne', 'Nicolson', 'Christopher', 'Meloni', 'Law', 'Order', 'series', 'throwing', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'big', 'screen', 'was', 'too', 'interesting', 'pass', 'up', 'icing', 'cake', 'was', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'who', 'Jim', 'Office.Julianne', 'character', 'wounded', 'hurt', 'boy', 'friend', 'Krasinski', 'so', 'permission', 'professor', 'take', 'project', 'interviewing', 'various', 'men', 'goal', 'learn', 'how', 'men', 'think', 'why', 'treat', 'women', 'way', 'do', 'information', 'mixture', 'painful', 'truths', 'obvious', 'lies', 'possible', 'fantasies', 'sincere', 'adoration', 'women', 'devious', 'mixed', 'messages', 'Krasinski', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'director', 'delivered', 'one', 'tougher', 'monologues', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'found', 'be', 'convincing', 'rather', 'insensitive', 'character', 'fact', 'cast', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'do', 'think', 'film', 'needed', 'little', 'more', 'editing', 'did', 'drag', 'few', 'times']",N/A
1293473,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B002VKB0JW,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[6, 7]","Two things are clear from actor turned writer/director John Krasinski's debut film ""Brief Interviews With Hideous Men."" One is that Krasinski has deep regard for its source material, the challenging David Foster Wallace collection of the same title. And two, Krasinski clearly has friends in the entertainment community for this film is populated with a veritable ""who's who"" of familiar faces in even the briefest of roles. I suspect that, like the book, this is a piece that will divide its audience. I don't suspect that many people who've read ""Brief Interviews With Hideous Men"" ever expected to see a film adaptation. A ""love it"" or ""hate it"" postmodern literary experiment, the book ""Hideous Men"" sometimes got lost in its own ambitions and cleverness. Brief snippets of story, sometimes with no discernable point or narrative conclusion, are told in a series of vignettes to explore the male dynamic especially in regard to his view of the female of the species. Some were terrific, some fell flat in this intriguing but exasperating work.Krasinski, in his screenplay, tries to tie these stories together with the smallest of narrative hooks. Julianne Nicholson, representing every woman, stands as the film's central performance--a researcher studying the male perspective. Existing completely and only to tie the male stories together, however, her underdeveloped character adds little to the overall experience. Shot in outright interview sessions, observations from Nicholson's actual life and fantasy sequences and recreations--Krasinski pulls out all the filmic bells and whistles to unite this into a cohesive piece. He has talent and I'd be interested to see his next pursuit, but his version of ""Brief Interviews With Hideous Men"" struck me more as an intriguing experiment as opposed to a fully formed film. Don't get me wrong, I admired many aspects within ""Hideous Men""--it was just a bit all over the place for my taste.Of the stories/performances (you will recognize just about every actor in the film--so there are too many to list here), several do stand out. Krasinski saves perhaps the best monologue for himself and is terrific delivering it. It is, however, a noticeably scripted piece and not remotely like actual verbal discourse. Dominic Miller gave my favorite performance as an unhinged student who challenges Nicholson. It has a power and surprise lacking from many of the stories. For example, Josh Charles does particularly well as a lothario but the segment offers little that we haven't seen countless times before. Like the book, the film has its stronger sequences and its less memorable ones. As a whole, though, I like the effort from an intellectual standpoint more than I appreciated it from an emotional one.

As of yet, I have only seen John Krasinski's film of the same name and subject.)This movie is viewed best as an overview of a certain mindset rather than of all men. It is comprised mainly of a series of interviews performed by a female interviewer (Julianne Nicholson). Male subjects include both strangers and close acquaintances. Nicholson is excellent, especially considering she is mostly silent. All women characters lack a voice here. This clearly symbolic reinforcement of women as objects and victims is interesting but also an easy evasion of creating the rare three-dimensional female characters.The inconclusive interviews are, at times, frustrating. In fact, several cut off when the subject is about to confess his most important theory about himself or women. Perhaps the point here isn't so much what these men believe; it's that they believe they are right. Many stones are left unturned, as there really is only one general theme in a variety of guises, that of objectification. Here, male insecurities and self-hatred lead to misogyny. Men ruminate on the female mystique. One man describes objectification related more to race than gender. The pieces range from humorous, inoffensive, and light, to powerful and truly sickening; some are both.'Brief Interviews with Hideous Men' has received mainly negative reviews.
