It presents a real man who was inspirational and dedicated to his mission.  He had courage and knew how to minister among those in need without making himself into a king among them.  He clearly won the hearts and touched the souls of the young men in the military around him.  This is a great movie.  He ""walks the talk"" of the Gospel - watch the video and you will be impressed; even if you don't consider yourself particularly ""religious"" you will find it easy to respect him and his personal character.",5,Solid & Inspirational,1266192000,"02 15, 2010",2010,600,"['was', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'film', 'was', 'awesome.It', 'not', 'syrupy', 'way', 'real', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'inspirational', 'dedicated', 'mission', 'had', 'courage', 'knew', 'how', 'minister', 'need', 'making', 'king', 'clearly', 'won', 'hearts', 'touched', 'souls', 'young', 'men', 'military', 'great', 'movie', 'talk', 'Gospel', 'watch', 'video', 'will', 'be', 'impressed', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'particularly', 'religious', 'will', 'find', 'easy', 'respect', 'personal', 'character']",Father of Mercy: The True Story of Venerable Don Gnocchi

Di Lollo ""Debby DiLollo""","[1, 2]","This movie, one in a series of foreign made movies about Catholic Saints distributed by Ignatius Press, is a good family film. I cannot vouch for historical accuracy; some of these Italian made films get rather ""creative"" with the personal life of the Saint featured in the film. However, it is a noble story with good depiction of everyday kind of struggles that people go through.  The acting is on par with some American TV rather than Hollywood.  My 11 year old son, who loves to ""play war"" and shoots everything that moves (including his fav target- his father!) with his Nerf guns, but who also gets up every morning to serve at 7 AM Mass (yes, even in summer), really liked this Saint's story. He identified with Fr. Gnocchi's manliness in his devotion to God and affection for his friends. Often a man's spirituality is portrayed in a feminine manner, which can be demoralizing to a ""real boy"" (let alone a ""real man!""). I recommend this film.",4,Good Family Movie,1278547200,"07 8, 2010",2010,951,"['movie', 'one', 'series', 'foreign', 'made', 'movies', 'Catholic', 'Saints', 'distributed', 'Ignatius', 'Press', 'good', 'family', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'vouch', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'Italian', 'made', 'films', 'get', 'rather', 'creative', 'personal', 'life', 'Saint', 'featured', 'film', 'However', 'noble', 'story', 'good', 'depiction', 'everyday', 'kind', 'struggles', 'people', 'go', 'acting', 'par', 'American', 'TV', 'rather', 'Hollywood', '11', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'who', 'play', 'war', 'shoots', 'everything', 'including', 'fav', 'target-', 'father', 'Nerf', 'guns', 'who', 'also', 'up', 'morning', 'serve', '7', 'AM', 'Mass', 'yes', 'even', 'summer', 'really', 'liked', 'Saint', 'story', 'identified', 'Fr', 'Gnocchi', 'manliness', 'devotion', 'God', 'affection', 'friends', 'Often', 'man', 'spirituality', 'portrayed', 'feminine', 'manner', 'can', 'be', 'demoralizing', 'real', 'boy', 'let', 'alone', 'real', 'man', 'recommend', 'film']",Father of Mercy: The True Story of Venerable Don Gnocchi

Italy is the same as Hollywood it seems. And this true story took place during World War II. Well, the ones who made the movie were probably not Catholic or were born after Vatican II when the novus ordo Mass started. When this priest was actually a priest, the Mass was in LATIN and totally different from the way the director/producer portrayed it. The vestments were correct, but the words were not. This is not a truly Catholic movie. Somebody truly orthodox should remake this movie please! It was terrible. Also, the story was sappy to begin with. Not realistic. Shame on Ignatius Press for putting forth such a bad movie. Too long, too.",3,Disappointed,1250553600,"08 18, 2009",2009,755,"['priest', 'story', 'was', 'good', 'one', 'am', 'sure', 'why', 'insert', 'love', 'triangle', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'reality', 'Italy', 'same', 'Hollywood', 'true', 'story', 'took', 'place', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Well', 'ones', 'who', 'made', 'movie', 'were', 'probably', 'not', 'Catholic', 'were', 'born', 'Vatican', 'II', 'when', 'novus', 'ordo', 'Mass', 'started', 'When', 'priest', 'was', 'actually', 'priest', 'Mass', 'was', 'LATIN', 'totally', 'different', 'way', 'director/producer', 'portrayed', 'vestments', 'were', 'correct', 'words', 'were', 'not', 'not', 'truly', 'Catholic', 'movie', 'Somebody', 'truly', 'orthodox', 'should', 'remake', 'movie', 'please', 'was', 'terrible', 'Also', 'story', 'was', 'sappy', 'begin', 'Not', 'realistic', 'Shame', 'Ignatius', 'Press', 'putting', 'forth', 'bad', 'movie', 'Too', 'long', 'too']",Father of Mercy: The True Story of Venerable Don Gnocchi
