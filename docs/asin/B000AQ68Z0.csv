930750,A3LW6FZ12WUX2A,B000AQ68Z0,"4MaskCurse ""Kyonshi Jiang Shi""","[11, 44]","I know that this dvd set isn't out yet and I really shouldn't rate it,but I have seen all of these episodes and just wanted to put my 2 cents in on the newest season.I agree with the larger part of reviews:please drop American Dadand focus on Family Guy! American Dad has it's moments,but what makes Family Guy great is that it makes fun of everybody. American Dad is pretty much just a slam on the right wing and that's it;and that gets really old after awhile.The left wing can be pretty stupid as well,and that's putting it mildly.Besides,we are still at war;and constantly poking fun at the CIA,the military,our government and our very country is just lame.While Family Guy is still great,it has lost a bit of it's spark.Stewie not being as maniacal and bent on killing Louis is part of the reason.I know I'm going to get alot of people rolling their eyes at me when I write this,but the whole episode about the Passion of Christ just wasn't funny... it was offensive and way out of line.It's almost as if it's in competition with SouthPark(a show I no longer watch for the same reasons)in being just plain offensive rather than funny or even crude.I'm not a religous zealot,and I still love adult animation. Family Guy is probabaly the best animated adult show on television right now.But I do have my priorities,and I'm not going to put Hollywood or pop culture before my faith.I really hope Family Guy doesn't do a ""South Park"" on us,and that Seth Macfarlane drops American Dad.",4,"Yeah,I know...

930756,A18DON5KI1ERFX,B000AQ68Z0,"Anthony Morelli ""Woofbear""","[4, 6]","I love this collection, for the laughs just don't stop...and they're real laughs...not forced laughs like that weirdo reviewer on amazon (M.F Haviland) talks about. How can you ""force a laugh"" while watching something like this? If you can't laugh a real laugh, then comedy such as Family Guy is NOT for you! All 3 discs are racier & heavier than the material on Volumes 1 & 2, making Volume 3 the best collection of Family Guy to own. Volumes 1 & 2 are funny, but just don't cut it compared to Vol. 3. Some of the episodes in this collection have already been aired on Fox at 9pm on Sunday nights...and some are still on their way. But the Sunday night versions are edited, making the DVD a must have in everyone's DVD collection.All family members stand out this time with their dry & ""in your face!"" humor. Lois & Stewie continue to keep their fans roaring with their nonchalant wit & charm. I've no favorite episodes and the most memorable & re-watchable segment has to be the ecstatic cow being milked in the last episode on Disc 4 ""Jungle Love"". It's just too funny to miss!Hopefully Fox will leave the show alone, giving it plenty of airtime & perhaps some all new episodes, giving us a Volume 4? I read in a review, something concerning the fact that you can't skip through the ads at the beginning of each disc. Well...for me, I don't really care, for it gives me a chance to get a drink or make myself comfortable, if I'm watching the DVD in bed. I don't like it when a movie starts right away and you blink your eye & miss the first few seconds, anyway.Sound & picture quality is great. Also, i like the preview ""sound clips"" in the menu of each disc, for they're helpful when you want to recall what was on a particular episode. Especially ""Jungle Love""...with the ecstatic cow. Or on ""Model Misbehavior"" where Lois is offered a modeling career by this older woman, whom Quagmire flirts with. There are so many small details & easy to miss ""snippets"" in each episode, calling for lots of concentration.DISC ONE (Episodes 1-4)- North By North Quahog (Air Date - 5/1/05)Peter Steals Mel Gibson's latest film, then agrees to swap it for Lois, high atop Mount Rushmore, while Brian and Stewie chaperone Chris at the school dance.- Fast Time At Buddy Cianci Jr. High (Air Date: 5/8/05)Chris is hot for his buxom blonde teacher, until she asks him to murder her husband- gangsta style!- Blind Ambition (Air Date: 5/15/05)Quagmire's penchant for peeping into women's restrooms gets him busted and Peter goes blind while attempting to break the world record for eating nickels.- Don't Make Me Over (Air Date: 6/05/05)With Meg's sudden popularity after a makeover, she becomes the focal point of the griffin family band-and hooks up with Jimmy Fallon of ""Saturday Night Live""!DISC TWO: (Episodes 5-8)- The Cleveland-Loretta Quagmire (Air Date: 6/12/05)After Peter discovers that Quagmire and Loretta are having an affair, he pushes Cleveland to take action--all too successfully.- Petarded (Air Date: 6/19/05)Peter is thrilled to learn he has been diagnosed as mentally-challenged, so he can now do whatever he pleases...until Child Services deems him unfit to care for his kids.- Brian The Bachelor (Air Date: 6/26/05)While Chris explores a budding relationship with his talking (and very manipulative) zit, Brian and Quagmire compete for the affections of the ""The Bachelorette"".- 8 Simple Rules For Buying My Teenage Daughter (Air Date: 7/10/05)Peter turns Meg over to his pharmacist's son to settle a $34,000 tab, while Stewie is smitten with his new babysitter--and decides her boyfriend must be destroyed.DISC THREE (Episodes 9-13)- Breaking Out Is Hard To Do (Air Date: 7/17/05)The rush of shoplifting turns Lois into a kleptomaniac and lands her in the slammer, but Peter smuggles her out (in his mouth) and the family takes refuge in Quahog's Asiantown.- Model Misbehavior (Air Date: 7/24/05)Peter puts his foot down after Lois launches a far-too-revealing modeling career, and Stewie convinces Brian to join his latest get-rich-quick scheme.- Peter's Got Woods (Air Date: 9/11/05)Peter's outraged!

This is a very good collection, and probably worth buying if you already have the first two volumes.You WILL laugh your ass off several times over, and you'll probably get offended and insulted a few times as well.  It comes with the show.  Love it or leave it.There's something missing from this volume though---something subtle---but this volume doesn't carry as much comedic weight as the first two.  Also, there isn't as much replay value in this volume.Alas this IS season four (volume 3), ""Family Guy's"" victorious return to television, and I'm sure they're just getting back into their groove.One noticeable difference in these episodes is that they often follow one major storyline throughout, whereas earlier episodes would so often have three or four going at once.

930763,A16PEMNNXMO1UQ,B000AQ68Z0,"Butch Ediocy ""sleepyeyedplumber""","[14, 18]","I say this, because the fourth season is not the best season of Family Guy.When I heard they were bringing the show back in 2005, I got up and sang the Happy Happy Joy Joy song, for that Family Guy was one of the funniest cartoons I have seen. But after seeing the season premiere, I was left somewhat dissapointed. In fact, by looking at a most episodes, it actually feels as if to say nobody has a clue what they are doing.The first three seasons were top-notch hilarious stories with edgy humor and solid concepts. The plotlines in the fourth season, however, were pretty damn stale. Fox may have been pressurizing Seth Macfarlane and his crew around, but that led the episodes to great stories and edgy situations that are not so hard to laugh at. Now with Fox letting them do whatever they please, everything becomes lazy. Episodes like ""Fast Times at Buddy Cianci Jr. High"" and ""Petarded"" would start off very nicely and come home with underdeveloped endings. Or even if they are not being lazy, they don't concentrate on the plots, rather, they concentrate on the humor itself--involving favorite catchphrases, inside-jokes, and trademark edginess, thinking those were the only elements that made the show successful, but really the chemistry of the show also included good concept, character development, and the evolution of the show.I included the evolution part, because when it comes to humor, they are digging up a few cliches here and there. (Remember Peter and the Chicken fight in DABOOM? It's back in ""Blind Ambition"".) Or at times when it's not cliched, it's edgy. The fourth season provided a hell of a lot of edgy humor that isn't so easy to laugh; In fact it's TOO edgy to be funny, and when it's too edgy, it's disturbing. I, for one, did not like the premiere episode ""North By North Quahog"", because the concept of Catholic Mel Gibson making a Rush Hour-esque sequel to ""The Passion of the Christ"" made the entire episode a mind-numbingly tedious exercise to watch. Or even when it's not cliched, or edgy, it's just plain lazy, stupid, and crude without even being funny, and that's included in a number of episodes such as ""Model Misbehavior"" (The Marijuana guy running around in the drug store is not funny at all.)The character development, too, is not the best thing out there. Peter's just a one-dimensional idiot so I won't worry about him, but characters like Stewie are not what they used to be; Stewie used to be an insane little boy that always causes mischief whereever he goes, but you barely see him actually cause any mischief in this season. Cleveland and his wife break up thier relationship and plan to divorce in ""The Cleveland-Loretta Quaqmire"", when you don't see them do much in the previous seasons of the show. Those are just a few examples of what I mean; you'll find out the rest on your own.On the upside, though, it's not that bad; it's still a little bit better entertainment than some animation that makes it through TV these days. The three stars are for the few gems in this set, which include ""Breaking out is Hard to Do"" and ""Brian the Bachelor"". With those episodes, I do believe they can still turn around in the fifth season, even with creator Seth Macfarlane leaving AMERICAN DAD to concentrate on this show.Oh man, I hope...I hope...",3,Hope they turn around next season...,1131148800,"11 5, 2005",2005,3295,"['say', 'fourth', 'season', 'not', 'best', 'season', 'Family', 'Guy.When', 'heard', 'were', 'bringing', 'show', 'back', '2005', 'got', 'up', 'sang', 'Happy', 'Happy', 'Joy', 'Joy', 'song', 'Family', 'Guy', 'was', 'one', 'funniest', 'cartoons', 'have', 'seen', 'seeing', 'season', 'premiere', 'was', 'left', 'somewhat', 'dissapointed', 'fact', 'looking', 'most', 'episodes', 'actually', 'say', 'nobody', 'clue', 'what', 'are', 'doing.The', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'were', 'top-notch', 'hilarious', 'stories', 'edgy', 'humor', 'solid', 'concepts', 'plotlines', 'fourth', 'season', 'however', 'were', 'pretty', 'damn', 'stale', 'Fox', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'pressurizing', 'Seth', 'Macfarlane', 'crew', 'around', 'led', 'episodes', 'great', 'stories', 'edgy', 'situations', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'hard', 'laugh', 'Now', 'Fox', 'letting', 'do', 'whatever', 'please', 'everything', 'becomes', 'lazy', 'Episodes', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Buddy', 'Cianci', 'Jr.', 'High', 'Petarded', 'would', 'start', 'off', 'very', 'nicely', 'come', 'home', 'underdeveloped', 'endings', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'being', 'lazy', 'do', ""n't"", 'concentrate', 'plots', 'rather', 'concentrate', 'humor', 'involving', 'favorite', 'catchphrases', 'inside-jokes', 'trademark', 'edginess', 'thinking', 'were', 'only', 'elements', 'made', 'show', 'successful', 'really', 'chemistry', 'show', 'also', 'included', 'good', 'concept', 'character', 'development', 'evolution', 'show.I', 'included', 'evolution', 'part', 'when', 'humor', 'are', 'digging', 'up', 'few', 'cliches', 'here', 'there', 'Remember', 'Peter', 'Chicken', 'fight', 'DABOOM', 'back', 'Blind', 'Ambition', 'times', 'when', 'not', 'cliched', 'edgy', 'fourth', 'season', 'provided', 'hell', 'lot', 'edgy', 'humor', ""n't"", 'so', 'easy', 'laugh', 'fact', 'TOO', 'edgy', 'be', 'funny', 'when', 'too', 'edgy', 'disturbing', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'premiere', 'episode', 'North', 'North', 'Quahog', 'concept', 'Catholic', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'making', 'Rush', 'Hour-esque', 'sequel', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'made', 'entire', 'episode', 'mind-numbingly', 'tedious', 'exercise', 'watch', 'even', 'when', 'not', 'cliched', 'edgy', 'just', 'plain', 'lazy', 'stupid', 'crude', 'even', 'being', 'funny', 'included', 'number', 'episodes', 'such', 'Model', 'Misbehavior', 'Marijuana', 'guy', 'running', 'around', 'drug', 'store', 'not', 'funny', 'character', 'development', 'too', 'not', 'best', 'thing', 'out', 'there', 'Peter', 'just', 'one-dimensional', 'idiot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'worry', 'characters', 'Stewie', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'Stewie', 'used', 'be', 'insane', 'little', 'boy', 'always', 'mischief', 'barely', 'see', 'actually', 'cause', 'mischief', 'season', 'Cleveland', 'wife', 'break', 'up', 'thier', 'relationship', 'plan', 'divorce', 'Cleveland-Loretta', 'Quaqmire', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'do', 'much', 'previous', 'seasons', 'show', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'examples', 'what', 'mean', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'rest', 'upside', 'though', 'not', 'bad', 'still', 'little', 'bit', 'better', 'entertainment', 'animation', 'TV', 'days', 'three', 'stars', 'are', 'few', 'gems', 'set', 'include', 'Breaking', 'out', 'Hard', 'Do', 'Brian', 'Bachelor', 'episodes', 'do', 'believe', 'can', 'still', 'turn', 'around', 'fifth', 'season', 'even', 'creator', 'Seth', 'Macfarlane', 'leaving', 'AMERICAN', 'DAD', 'concentrate', 'show.Oh', 'man', 'hope', 'hope']",N/A

Martin,"[2, 5]","I have to admit that while I was excited about the return of Family Guy, I was also somewhat apprehensive at the beginning of the new season. The show had been off the air for years, and I imagined that it would be hard to jump right back in. Making matters worse was the fact that Family Guy had entered a realm of nostalgia where I was willing to overlook the flaws of the first three seasons but was extra critical of anything new coming out.It only took the first episode to allay my fears. This is indeed Family Guy, back and as good as it ever was. It's got the same clever jokes, the absurd cutaways, and the same high quality of humor that made me love the show in the first place. Fans of the show will feel right at home from the moment that the first episode begins. The show is usually pretty accessible to newcomers as well, although if you haven't seen Family Guy before you'll probably want to check out at least some of the previous seasons first. As with most shows of at least some longevity, Family Guy has become a bit self-referential. If you haven't seen much of the series you'll probably be scratching your head at the kid with the upside down face and wondering why one episode features a five-minute long fight between Peter and a giant yellow chicken.Some of the episodes are weaker than others and some jokes miss their mark, but the show keeps the humor coming so quickly and on so many levels that there's something for everybody here. Family Guy may stumble down the line and become the next Simpsons, but it won't be here.

930766,A17ZP3VKZ4QRWT,B000AQ68Z0,Charlie Brooks,"[0, 0]","Family Guy has a strange history. Although it was always well-received, the executives at Fox seemed to have a vendetta against the show, heavily censoring it and then finally canceling it before its time. However, strong DVD sales and high ratings on Cartoon Network pulled the series back from the brink. The result is this DVD volume which features the beginning of Family Guy's return. The show starts off strong again, although it doesn't quite have the same crackle that it once had.Family Guy, like the Simpsons, has a number of divisive opinions. Some claim the shows have gone steadily downhill for years, while others claim that it's funnier than ever. My opinion on the series is the former, but most of that downhill slide came after this DVD volume. The episodes on this DVD include a terrific return to the airwaves coupled with a skewering of Fox's decision to cancel them in the first place. It fleshes out some of the minor characters of Quahog, such as Peter's neighbor Cleveland, and it gives the spotlight to Meg and Chris a bit more. Most importantly, it features an episode guest-starring James Woods that is one of the best Family Guy episodes there has ever been.The reason I give this four stars instead of five is because while the episodes are very good, there are definite signs that the show has lost some of its focus over the years. Stewie has gone from being an evil baby to a continuous gay joke, although the creators do sometimes tap back into his sinister side. The cutaways become increasingly nonsensical as the writers start to rely more on one-note jokes than the plot of the show. And some running gags, particularly Peter's recurring fights with a giant chicken, will leave newcomers to the show cold. While these are all symptoms to the show's eventual slide, the episodes here remain in good form. While not quite as strong as seasons 2 and 3 were, this new Family Guy is still worth watching and will definitely earn its laughs.",4,Back and as funny as ever...almost.,1257724800,"11 9, 2009",2009,1973,"['Family', 'Guy', 'strange', 'history', 'was', 'always', 'well-received', 'executives', 'Fox', 'seemed', 'have', 'vendetta', 'show', 'heavily', 'censoring', 'then', 'finally', 'canceling', 'time', 'However', 'strong', 'DVD', 'sales', 'high', 'ratings', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'pulled', 'series', 'back', 'brink', 'result', 'DVD', 'volume', 'beginning', 'Family', 'Guy', 'return', 'show', 'strong', 'again', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'same', 'crackle', 'once', 'had.Family', 'Guy', 'Simpsons', 'number', 'divisive', 'opinions', 'claim', 'shows', 'have', 'gone', 'steadily', 'downhill', 'years', 'others', 'claim', 'funnier', 'ever', 'opinion', 'series', 'former', 'most', 'downhill', 'slide', 'came', 'DVD', 'volume', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'include', 'terrific', 'return', 'airwaves', 'coupled', 'skewering', 'Fox', 'decision', 'cancel', 'first', 'place', 'out', 'minor', 'characters', 'Quahog', 'such', 'Peter', 'neighbor', 'Cleveland', 'spotlight', 'Meg', 'Chris', 'bit', 'more', 'Most', 'importantly', 'episode', 'guest-starring', 'James', 'Woods', 'one', 'best', 'Family', 'Guy', 'episodes', 'there', 'ever', 'been.The', 'reason', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'episodes', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'are', 'definite', 'signs', 'show', 'lost', 'focus', 'years', 'Stewie', 'gone', 'being', 'evil', 'baby', 'continuous', 'gay', 'joke', 'creators', 'do', 'sometimes', 'tap', 'back', 'sinister', 'side', 'cutaways', 'become', 'increasingly', 'nonsensical', 'writers', 'start', 'rely', 'more', 'one-note', 'jokes', 'plot', 'show', 'running', 'gags', 'particularly', 'Peter', 'recurring', 'fights', 'giant', 'chicken', 'will', 'leave', 'newcomers', 'show', 'cold', 'are', 'symptoms', 'show', 'eventual', 'slide', 'episodes', 'here', 'remain', 'good', 'form', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'strong', 'seasons', '2', '3', 'were', 'new', 'Family', 'Guy', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'will', 'definitely', 'earn', 'laughs']",N/A

With small underwhelming ratings and an ever-shifting schedule, the series seemed doomed and so it was when it was cancelled by Fox. Only rabid fanbases bought the DVD's like crazy and reruns on networks were very high in ratings. Fox realized a little late(as usual) that they did have a hit so they brought back the series and put out around 13 episodes this past spring/summer. While there's nothing as hysterical as previous episodes, it's still got its appeal.The season premiere welcomes back the fans with ""North by North Quahog"" with Peter delivering a monologue about cancelled Fox shows, mentioning at least over 25. Then we get some episodes about Peter going blind, Meg finally looking attractive, and Brian going on the Bachelorette. And as usual, we get the jabs at several celebrities including Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, the Osmonds and several others.While there is moments that are very funny, there's almost a ""resting on their laurels"" syndrome with some of the humor. The Simpsons formula revolved around a first act that had nothing to do with the rest of the episode such as the family attending a Renaissance Fair only to have the entire thing about the Simpsons in the future. For Family Guy, it's flashback gags where a character will say a variance of ""remember that time when...?"" or ""I hope I did better than..."". While it's of course part of the series, it's still a tad predictable.However, parts where the Keebler elves attack the Rice Krispies chefs with one of them not making it out alive or Jesus' action packed sequel to Passion of the Christ starring Chris Tucker(I love when the announcer can't pronounce Jim Caviezel's name). There's others during the show that are indeed funny although some might find a bit laziness such as bringing back the Chicken fight, Greased-up deaf guy or even Adam West doing a long laughing take, in place of his I love taffy scene.Some might be disappointed that there's less episodes here than any previous set. True, it only contains 13 episodes while the first set had 1 1/2 seasons in one pack but since the show picked up later on with Season 5 it's kind of understandable although you'd tend to ask ""why not just combine 4 and 5?"" The extras are good including my favorite where you get to see the actors doing a table read.

N,"[18, 42]","Like most people, I never really got into Family Guy until after it was cancelled and Cartoon Network began to run the episodes during their adult cartoon block known as Adult Swim. Soon after I went out an bought both box sets and I can say with confidence that was one of the most worthwild purchases I've ever made.When FOX announced the return of the show, I was excited, well, actually estatic, until season four came around. The first episode was decent (that Passion of the Christ 2 trailer still makes me laugh to this day) but after that I began to realize how touch-and-go the new episodes really were. Soon the clever, witty jabs one expected from Family Guy was replaced by unbelievable obserdity. Lois as a shoplifter, a crack addicted model? Cleveland and Loretta getting a divorce after she cheats on him with Quagmire? Obviously the writters would rather ""regrade"" the characters they worked so hard to develop in seasons 1-3 than actually come up with good, solid storylines.Which brings me to the title of this review ""What makes a real fan?"" Many people who actually like season four tell people ""they shouldn't hate season four because it's still Family Guy"". I honestly think it takes a bigger person and a much more loyal fan to admit if something isn't right even if they like the series, band, music or what ever it is they talking about. I think it is pointless and stupid to buy something just because it has a certain ""logo"" on it or just because you have an undying loyalty to something that blinds you to into believing everything curned out by a band or a creator of a cartoon is pure gold. That's my two cents, take or leave it.So, no, I won't be buying season 4 unless I find it in discount bin someday.

930783,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000AQ68Z0,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 3]","There's really no point in explaining this, but ""Family Guy"" rose to prominence in the '90s as a comedy show that pushed the limits. It was cancelled after it's third season...But due to succesful re-runs on Adult Swim and massive DVD sale; the show was revamped and the entire voice cast has returned for more episodes, all featured on this 3 Disc set. The show, despite varied reports, has improved a lot from the first three seasons. The show's are funnier and feature so many jokes in each one, you quickly forget the last one. They also keep to the form of the original shows, it's like no time passed at all. The Griffin family (Peter, Lois, Chris, Meg, Stewie, and Brian) are one of the funniest TV families ever and ""Family Guy"" is probably the best animated show you will find. Here's the episodes and my comments on them:DISC 11. North by North Quahog-This episode tackles everything from cancelled Fox television shows, to Pinochio, to religion. It's the ultimate beginning of a new season for Family Guy2. Fast Times at Buddy Cianci Jr. High-The writing of Good Will Hunting, Donny & Marie's incestual relationship, a broken blood vessel, and and more. Another hilarious episode.3. Blind Ambition-Any episode involving Quagmire, Naked Plastic Ladies, and a homeless man being dragged down the street by a dog is a winner.4. Don't Make Me Over-The Kevin Spacey, Neil Armstrong, Gene Simmons, and President Bush jokes are hilarious. Another terrific episode.DISC 21. The Cleveland Loretta Quagmire-Any episode centered around Quagmire is hilarious. The beds falling out everywhere is awesome.2. Petarded-One of the funniest episodes on here. Joke included or things parodied (the funniest in my opinion) The Vagina Monolouges, The Civil Rights Boardgame, Peter locking his keys outside the car, Firetrucks, Hiroshima, Tom Tucker's dead hooker, The Girl's Reply in the Bathroom, Stewie's Joke, Rocky Dennis, Quagmire's apperance at the sleep over are all hilarious.3. Brian the Bachelor-The first two minutes contains too many one-liners to name. Any scene with Quagmire is funny as hell. ""Put your pants on back on!"" ""Shut up!""4. 8 Simple Rules for Buying My Teenage Daughter-The humor in this episode is more nonchalant, but it's still great.DISC 31. Breaking Out is hard to Do-Jackie Chan, Sweatshops, Asian Trix, Asian Three's Company, The Truffle Shuffle, what more could you want. Childhood obesity.2. Model Misbehavior-The Cookie Monster and Quagmire...'nuff said.3. Peter's Got Woods-Racial jokes, James Woods, and Stewie the Pimp. Not the best episode, but it's cool.4. Perfect Castaway-Bjork jokes. The Skeet Ulrich joke is one of the funniest things ever put on this show.5. Jungle Love-The Cow, Bible Camp, and Will Ferrell. One of the wittiest episodes.Any ""Family Guy"" fan should be pleased and I hope this show has a longer run.GRADE: A",5,Funny as Hell,1148256000,"05 22, 2006",2006,2860,"['really', 'point', 'explaining', 'Family', 'Guy', 'rose', 'prominence', ""'90s"", 'comedy', 'show', 'pushed', 'limits', 'was', 'cancelled', 'third', 'season', 'due', 'succesful', 're-runs', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'massive', 'DVD', 'sale', 'show', 'was', 'revamped', 'entire', 'voice', 'cast', 'returned', 'more', 'episodes', 'featured', '3', 'Disc', 'set', 'show', 'varied', 'reports', 'improved', 'lot', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'show', 'are', 'funnier', 'feature', 'so', 'many', 'jokes', 'one', 'quickly', 'forget', 'last', 'one', 'also', 'keep', 'form', 'original', 'shows', 'time', 'passed', 'Griffin', 'family', 'Peter', 'Lois', 'Chris', 'Meg', 'Stewie', 'Brian', 'are', 'one', 'funniest', 'TV', 'families', 'ever', 'Family', 'Guy', 'probably', 'best', 'animated', 'show', 'will', 'find', 'Here', 'episodes', 'comments', 'DISC', '11', 'North', 'North', 'Quahog-This', 'episode', 'tackles', 'everything', 'cancelled', 'Fox', 'television', 'shows', 'Pinochio', 'religion', 'ultimate', 'beginning', 'new', 'season', 'Family', 'Guy2', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Buddy', 'Cianci', 'Jr.', 'High-The', 'writing', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Donny', 'Marie', 'incestual', 'relationship', 'broken', 'blood', 'vessel', 'more', 'hilarious', 'episode.3', 'Ambition-Any', 'episode', 'involving', 'Quagmire', 'Naked', 'Plastic', 'Ladies', 'homeless', 'man', 'being', 'dragged', 'street', 'dog', 'winner.4', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Make', 'Me', 'Over-The', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Neil', 'Armstrong', 'Gene', 'Simmons', 'President', 'Bush', 'jokes', 'are', 'hilarious', 'terrific', '21', 'Cleveland', 'Loretta', 'Quagmire-Any', 'episode', 'centered', 'Quagmire', 'hilarious', 'beds', 'falling', 'out', 'everywhere', 'awesome.2', 'Petarded-One', 'funniest', 'episodes', 'here', 'Joke', 'included', 'things', 'parodied', 'funniest', 'opinion', 'Vagina', 'Monolouges', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Boardgame', 'Peter', 'locking', 'keys', 'car', 'Firetrucks', 'Hiroshima', 'Tom', 'Tucker', 'dead', 'hooker', 'Girl', 'Reply', 'Bathroom', 'Stewie', 'Joke', 'Rocky', 'Dennis', 'Quagmire', 'apperance', 'sleep', 'are', 'hilarious.3', 'Bachelor-The', 'first', 'two', 'minutes', 'contains', 'too', 'many', 'one-liners', 'name', 'scene', 'Quagmire', 'funny', 'hell', 'Put', 'pants', 'back', 'Shut', 'up', '4', '8', 'Simple', 'Rules', 'Buying', 'My', 'Teenage', 'Daughter-The', 'humor', 'episode', 'more', 'nonchalant', 'still', 'great.DISC', '31', 'Breaking', 'Out', 'hard', 'Do-Jackie', 'Chan', 'Sweatshops', 'Asian', 'Trix', 'Asian', 'Three', 'Company', 'Truffle', 'Shuffle', 'what', 'more', 'could', 'want', 'Childhood', 'obesity.2', 'Model', 'Misbehavior-The', 'Cookie', 'Monster', 'Quagmire', 'said.3', 'Peter', 'Got', 'Woods-Racial', 'jokes', 'James', 'Woods', 'Stewie', 'Pimp', 'Not', 'best', 'episode', 'cool.4', 'Perfect', 'Castaway-Bjork', 'jokes', 'Skeet', 'Ulrich', 'joke', 'one', 'funniest', 'things', 'ever', 'put', 'show.5', 'Jungle', 'Love-The', 'Cow', 'Bible', 'Camp', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'One', 'wittiest', 'episodes.Any', 'Family', 'Guy', 'fan', 'should', 'be', 'pleased', 'hope', 'show', 'longer', 'run.GRADE']",N/A

I'm going to take the middle ground and say it has both qualities.First off, Seth and the gang had been on hiatus for a long time. You can tell by the lack of humor in the first few episodes. But slowly you can see the silver lining again.Man, I remember when I first got into Family Guy. I just remember thinking how oever the top it was and how recklessly funny it was. And I gobbled up every episode on the DVDs, just like many of you did.But sadly, fox canned the series. And after that opening rant peter makes, you can see how Fox is DEATH to any up-and-coming show.But after Fox realized how much money FG was making, they decided to bring it back.I sat down in front of my TV to watch that first new episode, just like all of you probably did. And I was just as disappointed at its lack of humor, story, and heart. The first few episodes of this season are verry shaky. But still they have their gems (like the Law and Order parody!)Eventually we see what was missing, plot and heart...and comedy. I stopped watching FG on tv because I couldn't stand what I thought it had become. But now I see that it really isn't that bad. And the new episodes on Fox are FANTASTIC! I can tell that the writers really know their fan base, since we don't see as many frivolous references and I was absolutely delighted to see Stewie portrayed as that homicidle mad-man (well, mad-baby) that we haven't seen since like season 2!If you can stand the couple of stinkers here, then you'll find some pretty good entertainment. But to those of you that hated this: don't lose heart!

I wish other series would follow suit.  Although I didn't enjoy most of these episodes as much as the earlier ones (there are a few I REALLY like), all the same Family Guy humor is here.  After the years in hiatus, the new shows flow together with the older ones very well, like it was never off the air.  Here's what you get:Disc 1:North By North Quahog-With their love life on the rocks, Lois and Peter go on a second honeymoon.  Peter pretends to be Mel Gibson to get into his swanky hotel suite and try to prevent the release of The Passion of the Christ II: Crucify This (""Let He who is without sin kick the first ass""). Car chase scene is silly. Highlight: Pinocio joke. Opening joke on all the Fox shows that were canceled since Family Guy got the ax is classic.Fast Times at Buddy Cianci Jr. High-Chris has a crush on his new teacher and Lois grows concerned when she finds a note in Chris' room outlining a plan to murder his teacher's husband.  Meanwhile, Brian becomes a teacher at the junior high and teaches a remedial class of pregnant girls and gangbangers.Blind Ambition-Lois catches Quagmire peeping at her in the ladies' room (hilarious) and Quagmire is forced to reform.  After saving a hot babe's life in a dressing room (Quagmire didn't realize he was giving her CPR), Quagmire is given a reward.  With all his friends achieving great feats (Cleveland was once a prominent auctioneer), Peter is worried he will never do anything memorable.  Peter tries to make the record books by eating nickels which cause him to go blind. Highlights:  Rice Krispies spoof, Stewie tripping Peter.  One of my favorites, but am I the only one who cannot stand those chicken fight segments?Don't Make Me Over-Meg gets a makeover, becomes the hottie in the Griffin family band and gets deflowered on Saturday Night Live.  Not a very good episode.  Note: Brian's racist upbringing comes up. Hospital scene is priceless.Disc 2:The Cleveland-Loretta Quagmire-Loretta has an affair with Quagmire but Cleveland is too meek to react, until Peter finally succeeds in egging him on.  A favorite of mine.Petarded-Lois tries to help Peter's self-esteem by giving him Trivial Pursuit questions from the pre school edition (""What is the color of a fire truck?"").  Peter takes an IQ test and finds out he's mentally retarded and takes advantage of it.  Highlights: ""Caution Special Dad"" sign, Quagmire observing Meg's slumber party, 7 prostitutes.Brian the Bachelor-Recently a viewer's choice.  Brian goes on The Bachelorette and takes the results a little too seriously. Highlight: JFK Jr. joke even Stewie found distasteful.8 Simple Rules for Buying My Teenage Daughter-Peter runs up a huge tab at the drug store and sells Meg to the druggist's geeky son, Neil, to pay it off.  Stewie falls in love with his new babysitter and decides to kill off her boyfriend.  Another one of the better episodes.  Highlight:  The ""I'm Sorry for trying to sell our daughter"" card.  Peter-""You don't know how hard it was to find one of those in English.""Disc 3:Breaking Out is Hard to Do-Lois discovers the exhilaration of shoplifting and is sentenced to prison for 3 years. When the Griffin house gets so bad that a deer wanders in, they break Lois out of prison and hide out in Asiantown.  So-so episode.Model Misbehavior-To get back at her strict father, Lois follows her dreams of becoming a model and goes down the wrong path.  Meanwhile, in order to pay for medicine to treat his worms, Brian works for Stewie in a pyramid scheme.  Highlight:  Stewie's security guard is his teddy bear.Peter's Got Woods-Brian falls in love with an African American teacher and tries very hard to hide his racist tendencies.  Peter finds a new best friend in James Woods.  One of my least favorites.Perfect Castaway--Peter and his buddies are shipwrecked on a desert island (the old sailor with the wooden limbs is very annoying here.  There is one joke he keeps running into the ground).  Lois thinks Peter is dead and remarries.  Highlight:  Peter's Christmas album:  ""I've brought these gifts for you, they're up in my bum.""Jungle Love--In order to avoid the torment of being a Freshman, Chris joins the Peace Corps and marries an 11-year old tribal girl.  While the family goes to the tribe to convince Chris to return with them, the natives attack them and Meg met her demise...or did she?Commentaries on almost every show, deleted scene animatics, ""World Domination:  The Family Guy Phenomenom"" featurette make up just a few of the extras.  Note on a previous criticism:  I was able to skip through all the ads at the beginning with the scene select feature on my DVD player (not the fast forward feature).",4,"""I've brought these gifts for

930793,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000AQ68Z0,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[151, 197]","It wasn't that long ago that Seth MacFarlane's Family Guy suffered an untimely death thanks to the brilliant collective minds at Fox, dooming the series to late night re-runs on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block.  However, the re-runs managed to get higher ratings then the syndicated episodes, and the DVD sales were surprisingly through the roof.  Thus, the voices of the people were heard by the mighty network, and Family Guy was miraculously resurrected and back on Fox.  The series gets off to a slamming start (including Peter's opening rant where he names every single show to air on Fox that suffered an untimely death as well) as Peter and Lois seek to spice up their relationship, and end up stealing the master copy of Mel Gibson's upcoming ""Passion of the Christ 2"".  Later on, Peter gets judged to be mentally incompetant, and there's plenty of other gags, in-jokes, and absurd references that only a handful of people will get.  It's true, this fourth season isn't the same quality as the previous three (Stewie is more of a wisecracking character than the evil baby genius hellbent on controling the world here, and his interaction with pet dog Brian isn't what it used to be) but it's still complete animated lunacy that is irreverant as ever, and hilarious as ever.  The voice team, including MacFarlane, MAD TV alum Alex Borstein, Seth Green, and That 70's Show's Mila Kunis, do great deadpan work.  All in all, it's great to have Family Guy back, and the prayers of longtime fans yearning for the show to return have thankfully been answered.  Let's hope that this time around, Fox has learned a lesson, and won't shuffle the show around the schedule to the brink of cancellation like they did before.",5,Power to the people,1125619200,"09 2, 2005",2005,1722,"['was', ""n't"", 'long', 'Seth', 'MacFarlane', 'Family', 'Guy', 'suffered', 'untimely', 'death', 'thanks', 'brilliant', 'collective', 'minds', 'Fox', 'dooming', 'series', 'late', 'night', 're-runs', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'block', 'However', 're-runs', 'managed', 'get', 'higher', 'ratings', 'then', 'syndicated', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'sales', 'were', 'surprisingly', 'roof', 'Thus', 'voices', 'people', 'were', 'heard', 'mighty', 'network', 'Family', 'Guy', 'was', 'miraculously', 'resurrected', 'back', 'Fox', 'series', 'slamming', 'start', 'including', 'Peter', 'opening', 'rant', 'where', 'single', 'show', 'air', 'Fox', 'suffered', 'untimely', 'death', 'well', 'Peter', 'Lois', 'seek', 'spice', 'up', 'relationship', 'end', 'up', 'stealing', 'master', 'copy', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'upcoming', 'Passion', 'Christ', '2', 'Later', 'Peter', 'judged', 'be', 'mentally', 'incompetant', 'plenty', 'other', 'gags', 'in-jokes', 'absurd', 'references', 'only', 'handful', 'people', 'will', 'get', 'true', 'fourth', 'season', ""n't"", 'same', 'quality', 'previous', 'three', 'Stewie', 'more', 'wisecracking', 'character', 'evil', 'baby', 'genius', 'hellbent', 'controling', 'world', 'here', 'interaction', 'pet', 'dog', 'Brian', ""n't"", 'what', 'used', 'be', 'still', 'complete', 'animated', 'lunacy', 'irreverant', 'ever', 'hilarious', 'ever', 'voice', 'team', 'including', 'MacFarlane', 'MAD', 'TV', 'alum', 'Alex', 'Borstein', 'Seth', 'Green', '70', 'Show', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'do', 'great', 'deadpan', 'work', 'great', 'have', 'Family', 'Guy', 'back', 'prayers', 'longtime', 'fans', 'yearning', 'show', 'return', 'have', 'thankfully', 'been', 'answered', 'Let', 'hope', 'time', 'around', 'Fox', 'learned', 'lesson', 'wo', ""n't"", 'shuffle', 'show', 'schedule', 'brink', 'cancellation', 'did', 'before']",N/A

The show ran from 1999 to 2002...although FOX hardly promoted it during the first run and it was cancelled in 2002.  But the DVD proved so popular that Fox brought the show back in May 2005, hyped it appropriately, and now it's become a huge hit with a tremendous following.  I'll admit that I was not a fan when I first saw the show but re-runs got me interested and now it is a fave!  This set features the first 13 episodes of Season Four...not ALL the episodes as some other reviews are claiming.  The last episode in the set is ""Jungle Love"" from September 2005.It's hard to pick a favorite episode.  This show is so incredibly clever with the inside jokes and sexual innuendo that you often have to watch twice just to pick up on everything that you might have missed.  Some of my favorites so far from this season and on this set are:""Petarded""  Peter thinks he's a genius after winning a game of trivial pursuit...and that's winning very loosely.  But then an intelligence test actually proves him to be mentally challenged.Brian the Bachelor""  Brain competes in the Bachelorette TV show and Chris gets a huge pimple on his face that actually talks to him ala the plant in Little Shop of Horrors.""Blind Ambition""  Peter tries to get into the Guiness bookof records for swallowing the most nickels but gets nickel poisoning and goes blind.""Jungle Love""  Peter gets a new job at a beer factory and is warned about drinking on the job...10 seconds later he's drunk and naked.Great show...filled with excellent special features.
