940480,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B000BCKFHU,Artist & Author,"[3, 3]","In a lot of ways, this movie is another 'bad kid in a private school movie.'  But, I think it is a cut above the others for three reasons.  First, it is quite realistic in its portrayal of the bad kid, Luther.  (Being a highly Catholic movie, I wonder if the name Luther has any significance!)  Second, it adds the element of utter secrecy of the Confessional for the priest.  Excommunication awaits any priest who breaks that secrecy.  Third, it brings up the element of the friend who witnessed the homicide, and his promise to not say anything.Parents need to discuss with their kids just when it is appropriate to remain quiet, and when a promise of secrecy needs to be broken, and this is a good movie to show them to bring up the subject..  For Catholics, parents might wish to discuss with their kids what they should do if they need to confess something that will put the priest in such a quandary as this priest.  The sin may not implicate the priest himself, as in this film, but should they burden him under the protection of the Confessional with knowledge that could save another person great harm?  Also, one might ask if divine forgiveness can really be given by confession only, without rectifying the sin in reality.  (For example, would Confession of a bank robbery really be forgiven if one still kept the money?)  This movie brings up these issues in a compelling way that teens should be able to relate to and to discuss.",4,Some Interesting Ethical Issues in a Psychological Drama,1154044800,"07 28, 2006",2006,1442,"['lot', 'ways', 'movie', ""'bad"", 'kid', 'private', 'school', 'movie', 'think', 'cut', 'others', 'three', 'reasons', 'First', 'quite', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'bad', 'kid', 'Luther', 'Being', 'highly', 'Catholic', 'movie', 'wonder', 'name', 'Luther', 'significance', 'Second', 'element', 'utter', 'secrecy', 'Confessional', 'priest', 'Excommunication', 'priest', 'who', 'secrecy', 'Third', 'up', 'element', 'friend', 'who', 'witnessed', 'homicide', 'promise', 'not', 'say', 'anything.Parents', 'need', 'discuss', 'kids', 'just', 'when', 'appropriate', 'remain', 'quiet', 'when', 'promise', 'secrecy', 'needs', 'be', 'broken', 'good', 'movie', 'show', 'bring', 'up', 'subject..', 'Catholics', 'parents', 'might', 'wish', 'discuss', 'kids', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'need', 'confess', 'something', 'will', 'put', 'priest', 'such', 'quandary', 'priest', 'sin', 'may', 'not', 'implicate', 'priest', 'film', 'should', 'burden', 'protection', 'Confessional', 'knowledge', 'could', 'save', 'person', 'great', 'harm', 'Also', 'one', 'might', 'ask', 'divine', 'forgiveness', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'given', 'confession', 'only', 'rectifying', 'sin', 'reality', 'example', 'would', 'Confession', 'bank', 'robbery', 'really', 'be', 'forgiven', 'one', 'still', 'kept', 'money', 'movie', 'issues', 'compelling', 'way', 'teens', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'discuss']",Confession

940482,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000BCKFHU,Grady Harp,"[9, 9]","Jonathan Myers makes an impressive film debut as writer/director of CONFESSION, a very well done film that unfortunately went direct to DVD.  Though the script is at times a bit clumsy and the control over the arch of emotion from the actors could be tighter, the film succeeds as a thriller, beautifully capturing the mysteries of the Catholic traditions.In a private, expensive Catholic Prep School Luther Scott (Chris Pine) is a business minded renegade, supplying the student body with booze, porn movies, and other off limits paraphernalia.  His hesitant roommate Robbie (Lukas Behnken) assists him but on a turnkey night their partying dorm is visited by the headmaster Father Thomas Parker (Bruce Davison) with a potential rich Senator's student son:  the party is over.  The boys are all subjected to questioning as to the source of the contraband and one student informs on Luther and Robbie and in a fit of anger Luther pushes the student to his death while disguised/dressed as a priest.  Luther makes Robbie promise to keep their secret and Luther 'absolves' himself in the confessional where he admits his murderous act to the kind Father Michael Kelly (Cameron Daddo). Obeying the rules that words said in confessional must remain secret, Father Kelly becomes suspect as the perpetrator and elects to remain silent.  The manner in which Luther and Robbie cope with the arrest of an innocent man and the resolution of the crime provide the exciting if a bit predictable conclusion to the story.The cast is variable but generally fine, especially Australian actor Cameron Daddo and young Chris Pine, allowing us to understand the rites of the Church without condescension.  The cinematography is moodily atmospheric and the musical score by Ryan Shore admixes ecclesiastic tones with contemporary mood music. Given that this is a first film for Myers it is one worth examining for the potential it carries.

The movie is set in the exclusive Catholic St. Michael's Prep School where handsome young student Chris Pine is selling drugs, booze and porn mags to obliging students.  When a fellow student turns him in, Pine and his roommate are expelled.  Chris plans revenge on the turncoat and suddenly finds a corpse on his hands.  Pine confesses his sin to friendly father Cameron Daddo knowing that the priest can't divulge what he hears in the confessional.  Soon evidence seems to point to the priest and Pine adds more fuel to the fire.The movie examines the Catholic code of faith and features fine support from Bruce Davison and Tom Bosley.  Pine and Daddo are excellent in their roles, with Daddo especially convincing as the tormented priest who has his own dark past.

The priests who run the school are venal, stupid, and back-biting. The students have apparently learned their lessons well because they, too, are venal, stupid, and back-biting. Then there's the plot. (This is not a spoiler) If you can explain why a priest can say &#34;I took Joe's confession at 10:30&#34; and then must lie and claim he &#34;just closed up and went to his room&#34; when he actually heard John's confession at 10:40, I'll modify my opinion from &#34;total piece of garbage&#34; to just &#34;garbage&#34;. Of course, you can't because there would be no movie if the priest had simply stated he had heard John's confession after he heard Joe's confession. The confessional seal only applies to what was said IN the confessional, not WHO confessed - which makes the whole premise of the movie bogus. Then, of course, there's the police detective who's out for priest's blood to avenge his prejudices against the Catholic Church. And, would someone please tell me why a male police detective wears eye makeup to work that makes him look like a drag queen? I was going to say, don't bother to watch this film unless you're sadistic and like wasting your life, but it may just be worth it to see the most far-fetched ending ever filmed. Maybe if Chris Pine had a few nude scenes it would have helped, but I doubt it.",1,"I'm no fan of the Roman Catholic Church, but even I have to admit this film portrays the church in a negative and unfair manner",1383091200,"10 30, 2013",2013,1507,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'am', 'fan', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'even', 'have', 'admit', 'film', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'extremely', 'negative', 'unfair', 'manner', 'priests', 'who', 'run', 'school', 'are', 'venal', 'stupid', 'back-biting', 'students', 'have', 'apparently', 'learned', 'lessons', 'well', 'too', 'are', 'venal', 'stupid', 'back-biting', 'Then', 'plot', 'not', 'spoiler', 'can', 'explain', 'why', 'priest', 'can', 'say', '34', 'took', 'Joe', 'confession', '10:30', '34', 'then', 'must', 'lie', 'claim', '34', 'just', 'closed', 'up', 'went', 'room', '34', 'when', 'actually', 'heard', 'John', 'confession', '10:40', ""'ll"", 'modify', 'opinion', '34', 'total', 'piece', 'garbage', '34', 'just', '34', 'garbage', '34', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'would', 'be', 'movie', 'priest', 'had', 'simply', 'stated', 'had', 'heard', 'John', 'confession', 'heard', 'Joe', 'confession', 'confessional', 'seal', 'only', 'what', 'was', 'said', 'IN', 'confessional', 'not', 'WHO', 'confessed', 'whole', 'premise', 'movie', 'bogus', 'Then', 'course', 'police', 'detective', 'who', 'out', 'priest', 'blood', 'avenge', 'prejudices', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'would', 'someone', 'please', 'tell', 'why', 'male', 'police', 'detective', 'wears', 'eye', 'makeup', 'work', 'look', 'drag', 'queen', 'was', 'going', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'watch', 'film', ""'re"", 'sadistic', 'wasting', 'life', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'worth', 'see', 'most', 'far-fetched', 'ending', 'ever', 'filmed', 'Maybe', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'had', 'few', 'nude', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'doubt']",Confession

This was one of those movies that received OK reviews by the public, but nothing special. I took a chance and purchased it. I doubt that I will ever watch it again in the future. The story is fairly weak whereas the locations, color and sets are top quality. The movie certainly has its weak points in terms of the script. Examples are when one of the students is shot and no one goes to his rescue, even though a crowd is present and the killer has fled.
