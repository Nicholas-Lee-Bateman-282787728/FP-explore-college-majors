1596887,A39CLUEZN0XIPY,B009INAH58,David Parker,"[7, 7]","Ahhhh, this really brings back the memories! Fond recollections of the Tea Party playing several smokin' concerts in very small clubs here in Burlington, Vermont (in fact, their debut album ""Splendor Solis"" was recorded right here!) I always thought they were an absolutely killer band live, but all along, there was no live album or video concert to remember them by - until now! In front of a packed Aussie audience of rabid fans, the band rips through a selection of songs from just about every phase of their career, and even includes a nice acoustic-based set. But as I've wondered many times before, why these guys never took over the world is beyond me! A combination of Led Zep crunch (along with a similar bent towards Middle-Eastern textures) with a singer who more often than not sounds a lot like Jim Morrison fronting a hard-rock band, these guys have been making great albums, and performing kickass shows for years, yet have remained relatively unknown enough to lead them to their inevitable break-up a few years ago. While several of Jeff Martin's solo outings have been good-to-great, this set really reminded me of how perfect the three of these guys are together - and how they haven't missed a step in-between (besides, few threesomes could ever pull off what they do in concert: just check out Stuart Chatwood's dexterity on bass guitar, keyboards and bass pedals!) Martin announces that they are ""back for good"", and that is GREAT news. Maybe now, the world will discover that they have simply been a bit ahead of their time! My only (slight) complaint would be: too much of Martin's between-song banter - but that's not enough to detract from anything here. If you miss big, creative, 70's-based riffs and powerful vocals, these guys are the real deal: live (as on this DVD, which by the way, is great in sound and picture), or in the studio.",4,Best Canadian trio since RUSH!!,1356652800,"12 28, 2012",2012,1866,"['Ahhhh', 'really', 'back', 'memories', 'Fond', 'recollections', 'Tea', 'Party', 'playing', 'several', 'smokin', 'concerts', 'very', 'small', 'clubs', 'here', 'Burlington', 'Vermont', 'fact', 'debut', 'Splendor', 'Solis', 'was', 'recorded', 'right', 'here', 'always', 'thought', 'were', 'absolutely', 'killer', 'band', 'live', 'along', 'was', 'live', 'album', 'video', 'concert', 'remember', 'now', 'front', 'packed', 'Aussie', 'audience', 'rabid', 'fans', 'band', 'selection', 'songs', 'just', 'phase', 'career', 'even', 'nice', 'acoustic-based', 'set', ""'ve"", 'wondered', 'many', 'times', 'why', 'guys', 'never', 'took', 'world', 'combination', 'Led', 'Zep', 'crunch', 'similar', 'bent', 'towards', 'Middle-Eastern', 'textures', 'singer', 'who', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'lot', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'fronting', 'hard-rock', 'band', 'guys', 'have', 'been', 'making', 'great', 'albums', 'performing', 'kickass', 'shows', 'years', 'yet', 'have', 'remained', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'enough', 'lead', 'inevitable', 'break-up', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'several', 'Jeff', 'Martin', 'solo', 'outings', 'have', 'been', 'good-to-great', 'set', 'really', 'reminded', 'how', 'perfect', 'three', 'guys', 'are', 'together', 'how', 'have', ""n't"", 'missed', 'step', 'in-between', 'few', 'threesomes', 'could', 'ever', 'pull', 'off', 'what', 'do', 'concert', 'just', 'check', 'out', 'Stuart', 'Chatwood', 'dexterity', 'bass', 'guitar', 'keyboards', 'bass', 'pedals', 'Martin', 'are', 'back', 'good', 'GREAT', 'news', 'Maybe', 'now', 'world', 'will', 'discover', 'have', 'simply', 'been', 'bit', 'ahead', 'time', 'only', 'slight', 'complaint', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'Martin', 'between-song', 'banter', 'not', 'enough', 'detract', 'anything', 'here', 'miss', 'big', 'creative', ""70's-based"", 'riffs', 'powerful', 'vocals', 'guys', 'are', 'real', 'deal', 'live', 'DVD', 'way', 'great', 'sound', 'picture', 'studio']",The Tea Party - Live in Australia - The Reformation Tour

The set list is great and the band is in top form from start to finish. It's great to see these guys back in solid shape and performing so well its like they never left. The companion live album is excellent too.

1596889,A2X2X8S80WW29I,B009INAH58,J. R. Cagle,"[2, 2]",Jeff Martin is right! Women are the better half. My wife turned me on to these guys a few years ago knowing I was a big Zep and Doors fan! Its like having the best of both worlds but make no mistake Tea Party put their own style on this wonderful DVD. Songs like The River and Save Me for me at least sound better live than on record. The sound on this DVD is incredible and as good as ay DVD I have minus Pulse. For those of you who say these guys are lame or unoriginal get over yourselves! This DVD is true Rock N Roll the way it should be. Jeff is a great host and his comments are both whitty and funny to listen too. For a three piece the sound is big and Zeppelinesque in a GOOD way. Jeff Burrows and Stuart Chatwood are a powehouse rythym section and compliment the multi talented Martin well.. They are back he says for good! Lets hope that is true and for a very long time!,5,Repeated viewing is a MUST!

1596890,A5R336VHUTPQR,B009INAH58,"To The Max&#34;Bax&#34; ""Baximus111""","[0, 0]","Back for good....so they say and I can't believe how well they kicked off their reformation of the band. During the summer of 2012, Canadian rock trio The Tea Party embarked on a tour of Australia.Canadian fans adore them, as much so does the rest of the world, especially ""down under"". Recorded at The Hordern Pavilion in Sydney, this concert DVD brings new life to all your favorite hits from the bands extensive catalog.Pretty much just picking up where they left off, singing their classics as if they have kept touring since 2005. Martin's vocals are in fine form and this DVD showcases a band bursting with renewed energy.The Tea Party...Jeff Burrows - drums, percussion, backing vocalsStuart Chatwood - bass, keyboards, harmonium, mandolin, acoustic guitar, backing vocalsJeff Martin - guitar, acoustic guitar, theremin, esraj, oud, bowedThey have been around for approximately 20 years and after a 7 year hiatus they are back with their latest offering, a ""Live from Australia - The Reformation Tour."" I guess the endless support and pressure from their fans to put it all together again was more than any band could wish for, so they made their fan's dreams come true.One week prior to The Tea Party's show at the Hordern Pavilion, Sydney on July 21, 2012 they announced they would be filming the concert for a live Blu-ray/DVD release, when they reminded the audience in attendance every face in the Pavillion lit up.What more can I say, the band is awesome, and as usual always at the top of their game. Jeff Martin oozes charisma,throughout the performance and especially during the acoustic numbers. His laid back style, fluid hand gestures and confidence makes this the celebration to remember. Owning this concert DVD is a must have for all Tea Party fans.Hopefully they'll get back to their roots and create more of the music that made them such a huge success.Long Live, ""Moroccan Roll"".",5,"Long Live ""Moroccan Roll""...",1362268800,"03 3, 2013",2013,1904,"['Back', 'good', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'well', 'kicked', 'off', 'reformation', 'band', 'summer', '2012', 'Canadian', 'rock', 'trio', 'Tea', 'Party', 'embarked', 'tour', 'Australia.Canadian', 'fans', 'adore', 'as', 'much', 'rest', 'world', 'especially', 'down', 'Recorded', 'Hordern', 'Pavilion', 'Sydney', 'concert', 'DVD', 'new', 'life', 'favorite', 'hits', 'bands', 'extensive', 'catalog.Pretty', 'much', 'just', 'picking', 'up', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'singing', 'classics', 'have', 'kept', 'touring', '2005', 'Martin', 'vocals', 'are', 'fine', 'form', 'DVD', 'band', 'bursting', 'renewed', 'energy.The', 'Tea', 'Party', 'Jeff', 'Burrows', 'drums', 'percussion', 'backing', 'vocalsStuart', 'Chatwood', 'bass', 'keyboards', 'harmonium', 'mandolin', 'acoustic', 'guitar', 'backing', 'vocalsJeff', 'Martin', 'guitar', 'acoustic', 'guitar', 'theremin', 'esraj', 'oud', 'bowedThey', 'have', 'been', 'approximately', '20', 'years', '7', 'year', 'hiatus', 'are', 'back', 'latest', 'offering', 'Live', 'Australia', 'Reformation', 'Tour', 'guess', 'endless', 'support', 'pressure', 'fans', 'put', 'together', 'again', 'was', 'more', 'band', 'could', 'wish', 'made', 'fan', 'dreams', 'come', 'true.One', 'week', 'prior', 'Tea', 'Party', 'show', 'Hordern', 'Pavilion', 'Sydney', 'July', '21', '2012', 'announced', 'would', 'be', 'filming', 'concert', 'live', 'Blu-ray/DVD', 'release', 'when', 'reminded', 'audience', 'attendance', 'face', 'Pavillion', 'lit', 'up.What', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'band', 'awesome', 'usual', 'always', 'top', 'game', 'Jeff', 'Martin', 'charisma', 'performance', 'especially', 'acoustic', 'numbers', 'laid', 'back', 'style', 'fluid', 'hand', 'gestures', 'confidence', 'celebration', 'remember', 'Owning', 'concert', 'DVD', 'must', 'have', 'Tea', 'Party', 'fans.Hopefully', ""'ll"", 'get', 'back', 'roots', 'create', 'more', 'music', 'made', 'huge', 'success.Long', 'Live', 'Moroccan', 'Roll']",The Tea Party - Live in Australia - The Reformation Tour
