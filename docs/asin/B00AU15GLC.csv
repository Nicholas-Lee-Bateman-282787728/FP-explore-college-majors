The sound on this disc is fantastic, and the visual presentation is equally as good. If you are into rock and you have previously been prejudiced against this music group, it's time to let the sound fill your ears and clean out the poor and undernourished vocals of other lesser singers that you may have been feeding upon. This is an absolutely incredible performance.If you have been in search of a heavy but still pop-driven rock show, &#34;Queen: Live at Wembley Stadium&#34; might just be the ultimate musical orgasm that you have been waiting for.",5,Majesterial display of exuberance from an always divisive band that remains more entertaining than ever!,1393545600,"02 28, 2014",2014,804,"['Freddie', 'Mercury', 'pick', 'number', 'one', 'vocalist', 'time', 'realm', 'rock/pop', 'fields', 'least', 'DVD', 'why', 'loose', 'beer-fueled', 'crowd-pumping', 'performances', 'were', 'most', 'watchable', 'rock/pop', 'spectacles', 'ever', 'given', 'sound', 'disc', 'fantastic', 'visual', 'presentation', 'equally', 'as', 'good', 'are', 'rock', 'have', 'previously', 'been', 'prejudiced', 'music', 'group', 'time', 'let', 'sound', 'fill', 'ears', 'clean', 'out', 'poor', 'undernourished', 'vocals', 'other', 'lesser', 'singers', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'feeding', 'upon', 'absolutely', 'incredible', 'performance.If', 'have', 'been', 'search', 'heavy', 'still', 'pop-driven', 'rock', 'show', '34', 'Queen', 'Live', 'Wembley', 'Stadium', '34', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'ultimate', 'musical', 'orgasm', 'have', 'been', 'waiting']",Queen: Live at Wembley Stadium

It is, and I've seen many concerts in many genres of music, the very best of the best. I'm a massive Van Halen fan, and I've seen them on tour live and their videos as well. The mighty VH loses to this DVD. Originally, only the Friday show was released because of better weather, and it just looked better, but the Saturday show was no slouch. There are inherent video quality issues, it is 25 years old, but the sound is superb.",5,"Classic concert, and here's both nights",1374192000,"07 19, 2013",2013,555,"['Stunning', 'Simply', 'stunning', 'band', 'was', 'absolutely', 'top', 'game', 'crowd', 'was', 'heaving', 'Freddie', 'ruled', 'place', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'concerts', 'many', 'genres', 'music', 'very', 'best', 'best', ""'m"", 'massive', 'Van', 'Halen', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'tour', 'live', 'videos', 'well', 'mighty', 'VH', 'DVD', 'Originally', 'only', 'Friday', 'show', 'was', 'released', 'better', 'weather', 'just', 'looked', 'better', 'Saturday', 'show', 'was', 'slouch', 'are', 'inherent', 'video', 'quality', 'issues', '25', 'years', 'old', 'sound', 'superb']",Queen: Live at Wembley Stadium
