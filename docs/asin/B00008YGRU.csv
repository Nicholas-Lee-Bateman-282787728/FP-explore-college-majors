749567,A1U0HUXO9GLOUD,B00008YGRU,"Akira ""gigatonx""","[4, 4]","24 follows the story of Jack Baur, an inactive Counter Terrorism Unit agent.  At the present time a nuclear bomb has been smuggled into Los Angeles and its set to off today.  The only person that can get the job done is Jack Baur.  Each episode represents one hour in the day and during this time you get to see the  different situations each character experiences.After hearing all the buzz about how great 24 was I decided to check it out for  myself. After I saw the first episode I could not believe at how good this series was.  After each episode I was tempted to the watch the next and then next.  This probably one of the most captivating series that when its over you'll be eagerly anticipating the next season, especially after the huge cliffhanger in the last episode. This show has it all great plot, the most interesting characters, and enough government conspiracies &amp; action to keep you on the edge of your seats.*HIGHLY RECOMMENDED*",5,24 is just to addictive,1081987200,"04 15, 2004",2004,952,"['24', 'story', 'Jack', 'Baur', 'inactive', 'Counter', 'Terrorism', 'Unit', 'agent', 'present', 'time', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'been', 'smuggled', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'set', 'today', 'only', 'person', 'can', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'Jack', 'Baur', 'episode', 'one', 'hour', 'day', 'time', 'get', 'see', 'different', 'situations', 'character', 'experiences.After', 'hearing', 'buzz', 'how', 'great', '24', 'was', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'saw', 'first', 'episode', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'how', 'good', 'series', 'was', 'episode', 'was', 'tempted', 'watch', 'next', 'then', 'next', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'captivating', 'series', 'when', ""'ll"", 'be', 'eagerly', 'anticipating', 'next', 'season', 'especially', 'huge', 'cliffhanger', 'last', 'episode', 'show', 'great', 'plot', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', 'enough', 'government', 'conspiracies', 'amp', 'action', 'keep', 'edge', 'seats', '*HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED*']",24: Season 2
749568,A3TLY1A7NGVCQM,B00008YGRU,"Alexander E. Paulsen ""AlexP""","[0, 0]","I have a high threshold for excitement. Most movies are slow moving, boring and predictable. Major league football puts me to sleep. Hockey only keeps me awake because of the noise. In short, it takes a lot to get my heart rate above 56. 24 can put me into fibbrillation. I dream about it after watching more than one episode.My daughter comes down to see me literally on the edge of my seat during an episode. She laughed ""Dad, now I know what they mean by edge of the seat thrills, every time I see you your're about to fall off the end of the chair.""The two spotlight reviews give a lot away. I really don't like to drop spoilers in a review so I will stay arms length from the plot. In 24 just about anything you say about classifies as a spoiler since so much happens and the plot is an intricate chain of events with just about everything linked. Just knowing who is recruited to help Jack can totally ruin the end of Season 1 for someone who hasn't seen it.The public knowledge about this season is that Jack Bauer is no longer with CTU. George Mason is in charge. Jack is off the payroll recovering from the events of last few minutes of season 1. This is a year later. ( real time again) Tony Almeida ( great character and terrific work by Carlos Bernard)  is back with a new CTU crew.Word gets out, there is some sort of nuclear device in Los Angeles planted by a terrorist group called Second Wave. David Palmer is President. ( hell, I would vote for David Palmer! )There is a link with a domestic terror group that flags Jack Bauer. He was undercover with this group and is the only guy with a half chance of infiltrating them again in order to track down the nuke.Jack also has to ally with an old enemy - name witheld to prevent a spoiler. The plot starts in overdrive and picks up speed from there.The plotting is intricate, all events relate to all others. The race is on to find the nuke and save LA. There are several more subplots with of course Kim, Jacks daughter in trouble again. I guess the family aspect helps add tension to Jacks mission, but that subplot is lame compared to whats happening at higher levels of the government with the conspiracy leading all the way to the uppermost echelons of government.Like Season 1 the action is non-stop. There is at least one major shocker in each episode and each one ends in an irresistable cliffhanger that will have you cueing up the next one right away not even wanting to take a minute to review the ""Previously on 24"" spot. You want it NOW!In any other show or movie the plot would climax after they find the bomb, or course trhe guys would cut the green wire and that would the that. Nothing so pedestrian would ever make a 24 Episode.In 24 you can ever count on them finding and disarming the bomb. Maybe they do, then again maybe not - I won't say here. But whatever does happen with the bomb I will say that the plot INTENSIFIES from there!Like with Season 1, I had an impossible time turning off the DVD player until the disk was finished.I didn't expect S2 to have the thrills and excitement of Season 1 since I knew a little more of what to expect from the show but if anything I was even more out of breath after these episodes.One thing though, 24 will spoil you for most other TV shows and movies. Get used to the real time format and everything else seems lame. The only other TV show with the edge of 24 is maybe the new Battlestar Galactica, but that isn't the same serial format and no where near as addicting as 24.24 is addicting and beware. Once you start you won't want to put them away until you're done.The producers, directors and writers do a marvelous job of hooking you into the plot and caring about the characters and even feeling their pain.Watch this show. It is the best of the best. This is as good as TV gets folks.I come up with a great idea for a 24 party. Get a bunch of hardcores together and watch it real time. Start at 8am and play the disks realtime with the clock. Only break to bathroom and eat during the commercial gaps. Cue them up and restart on time.",5,I have a high threshold for excitement,1109635200,"03 1, 2005",2005,4070,"['have', 'high', 'threshold', 'excitement', 'Most', 'movies', 'are', 'slow', 'moving', 'boring', 'predictable', 'Major', 'league', 'football', 'sleep', 'Hockey', 'only', 'awake', 'noise', 'short', 'lot', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', '56', '24', 'can', 'put', 'fibbrillation', 'dream', 'watching', 'more', 'one', 'episode.My', 'daughter', 'down', 'see', 'literally', 'edge', 'seat', 'episode', 'laughed', 'Dad', 'now', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'edge', 'seat', 'thrills', 'time', 'see', ""'re"", 'fall', 'off', 'end', 'chair', 'two', 'spotlight', 'reviews', 'give', 'lot', 'away', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'drop', 'spoilers', 'review', 'will', 'stay', 'arms', 'length', 'plot', '24', 'just', 'anything', 'say', 'about', 'classifies', 'spoiler', 'so', 'much', 'happens', 'plot', 'intricate', 'chain', 'events', 'just', 'everything', 'linked', 'Just', 'knowing', 'who', 'recruited', 'help', 'Jack', 'can', 'totally', 'ruin', 'end', 'Season', '1', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'it.The', 'public', 'knowledge', 'season', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'longer', 'CTU', 'George', 'Mason', 'charge', 'Jack', 'payroll', 'recovering', 'events', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'season', '1', 'year', 'later', 'real', 'time', 'again', 'Tony', 'Almeida', 'great', 'character', 'terrific', 'work', 'Carlos', 'Bernard', 'back', 'new', 'CTU', 'crew.Word', 'out', 'sort', 'nuclear', 'device', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'planted', 'terrorist', 'group', 'called', 'Second', 'Wave', 'David', 'Palmer', 'President', 'hell', 'would', 'vote', 'David', 'Palmer', 'link', 'domestic', 'terror', 'group', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'was', 'undercover', 'group', 'only', 'guy', 'half', 'chance', 'infiltrating', 'again', 'order', 'track', 'down', 'nuke.Jack', 'also', 'ally', 'old', 'enemy', 'name', 'witheld', 'prevent', 'spoiler', 'plot', 'overdrive', 'up', 'speed', 'there.The', 'plotting', 'intricate', 'events', 'relate', 'others', 'race', 'find', 'nuke', 'save', 'LA', 'are', 'several', 'more', 'subplots', 'course', 'Kim', 'Jacks', 'daughter', 'trouble', 'again', 'guess', 'family', 'aspect', 'add', 'tension', 'Jacks', 'mission', 'subplot', 'lame', 'compared', 'whats', 'happening', 'higher', 'levels', 'government', 'conspiracy', 'leading', 'way', 'uppermost', 'echelons', 'government.Like', 'Season', '1', 'action', 'non-stop', 'least', 'one', 'major', 'shocker', 'episode', 'one', 'irresistable', 'cliffhanger', 'will', 'have', 'cueing', 'up', 'next', 'one', 'right', 'away', 'not', 'even', 'wanting', 'take', 'minute', 'review', 'Previously', '24', 'spot', 'want', 'NOW', 'other', 'show', 'movie', 'plot', 'would', 'climax', 'find', 'bomb', 'course', 'trhe', 'guys', 'would', 'cut', 'green', 'wire', 'would', 'Nothing', 'so', 'pedestrian', 'would', 'ever', 'make', '24', 'Episode.In', '24', 'can', 'ever', 'count', 'finding', 'disarming', 'bomb', 'Maybe', 'do', 'then', 'again', 'maybe', 'not', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'here', 'happen', 'bomb', 'will', 'say', 'plot', 'INTENSIFIES', 'there', 'Season', '1', 'had', 'impossible', 'time', 'turning', 'off', 'DVD', 'player', 'disk', 'was', 'finished.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'S2', 'have', 'thrills', 'excitement', 'Season', '1', 'knew', 'little', 'more', 'what', 'expect', 'show', 'anything', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'breath', 'episodes.One', 'thing', '24', 'will', 'spoil', 'most', 'other', 'TV', 'shows', 'movies', 'Get', 'used', 'real', 'time', 'format', 'everything', 'else', 'lame', 'only', 'other', 'TV', 'show', 'edge', '24', 'maybe', 'new', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', ""n't"", 'same', 'serial', 'format', 'where', 'near', 'as', 'addicting', '24.24', 'addicting', 'beware', 'Once', 'start', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'put', 'away', ""'re"", 'done.The', 'producers', 'directors', 'writers', 'do', 'marvelous', 'job', 'hooking', 'plot', 'caring', 'characters', 'even', 'feeling', 'pain.Watch', 'show', 'best', 'best', 'as', 'good', 'TV', 'folks.I', 'come', 'up', 'great', 'idea', '24', 'party', 'Get', 'bunch', 'hardcores', 'together', 'watch', 'real', 'time', 'Start', '8am', 'play', 'disks', 'realtime', 'clock', 'Only', 'break', 'bathroom', 'eat', 'commercial', 'gaps', 'Cue', 'up', 'restart', 'time']",24: Season 2

In fact all of the major characters (except Terri, of course) are back again. I was disappointed with their decision to bring Sherri and Nina back even though I'm a fan of Nina. But, if 24 were as real as it thinks it is, Nina should have spent the rest of her life in jail (though, I loved the interrogation scenes between Nina and Jack!). Fortunately, by season four they wisely decided to put a lot of fresh faces in the cast.By far, the worst thing about this season was their decision to give Kim a huge chunk of the time.  Whereas in the first season she played an important role in being the bad guys' leverage against Jack, this time she is utterly irrelevent to the main plot of the nuke threat. The writers did an abysmal job with the role they assigned her this time.How did this girl live to be in her late teens when on a typical day she's kidnapped, held hostage, arrested for murder, and chased by wild animals?!? Note that those were independent events that I listed! Some people think Chloe (seasons 3, 4, 5) is annoying but at least Mary Rajskub can act and can come across as caring without being condescending.Overall, this is a good season.

His wife was killed by Nina Myers minutes before she was caught, his daughter Kim blames him for the death, and he has been out of commission ever since.  But those problems are only the beginning.  It is revealed that a terrorist group named Second Wave plans to detonate a nuclear bomb somewhere in Los Angeles sometime that day, and the only lead that CTU has is linked to Bauer.  Palmer, now the President, had George Mason, now the Director of CTU, immediately reinstate Bauer so that he can infiltrate the lead and find out where the bomb is.  Along the way, many secrets come out such as a conspiracy within the government to allow the bomb into the country, and all along, Kim keeps getting into more trouble.  Once again, this proves to be one of the greatest shows on television.  You will be hooked from the beginning, and you will never want to stop watching.

749585,A34A7QEBMYTALW,B00008YGRU,"Arthur Kicker ""Ragged, Tagged, and Bodybagged""","[11, 12]","After a fabulous first season that saw Jack Bauer stop the assassination of the president, '24' returns for a second season.  This time Bauer must stop a nuclear warhead from going off in downtown Los Angeles.  The creators of the show upped everything:  the violence, action, doublecrosses...everything was notched up.  Which was good up to a point.  I was totally into it throughout the entire search for the bomb, but when the main focus switched over to the search for a computer chip...it just seemed like much less was at stake all the sudden.And why must the makers feel the need to put Bauer's daughter in constant danger?  The very annoying Elisha Cuthbert(does it bother anyone else that she has dark brown eyebrows and platnum blonde hair?)has a day that rivals her father's but not in terms of importance but in annoyance.  Its truly irritating to be deeply involved in the main story and the scene cuts to Cuthbert fighting a mountain lion.  Other than Cuthbert, the performances are great.  Kiefer Sutherland owns the role of Jack Bauer.  Dennis Haysbert is so good as the President that he could run for the real office and I'd probably vote for him.  And Carlos Bernard as Tony Almeida is the unsung hero of the series.  He turns in a great performance every show.The writing is very tight.  The dialogue is good, except for the fact that the phrases ""within the hour"" and ""in real time"" are overused.  Other than the few too many red herrings, the story is very well done and chugs right along.  Like I said, when the focus switches mid-season from a nuclear bomb to a computer disk, its a bit of a letdown.Overall, '24' is a very good television show.  While not as good as its first season, the second is still worth checking out especially for its excellent first half.",3,24 Again,1124582400,"08 21, 2005",2005,1789,"['fabulous', 'first', 'season', 'saw', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'stop', 'assassination', 'president', 'returns', 'second', 'season', 'time', 'Bauer', 'must', 'stop', 'nuclear', 'warhead', 'going', 'off', 'downtown', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'creators', 'show', 'upped', 'everything', 'violence', 'action', 'doublecrosses', 'everything', 'was', 'notched', 'up', 'Which', 'was', 'good', 'up', 'point', 'was', 'totally', 'entire', 'search', 'bomb', 'when', 'main', 'focus', 'switched', 'search', 'computer', 'chip', 'just', 'seemed', 'like', 'much', 'less', 'was', 'stake', 'sudden.And', 'why', 'must', 'makers', 'feel', 'need', 'put', 'Bauer', 'daughter', 'constant', 'danger', 'very', 'annoying', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'bother', 'anyone', 'else', 'dark', 'brown', 'eyebrows', 'platnum', 'blonde', 'hair', 'day', 'father', 'not', 'terms', 'importance', 'annoyance', 'truly', 'irritating', 'be', 'deeply', 'involved', 'main', 'story', 'scene', 'cuts', 'Cuthbert', 'fighting', 'mountain', 'lion', 'Other', 'Cuthbert', 'performances', 'are', 'great', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'role', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'so', 'good', 'President', 'could', 'run', 'real', 'office', ""'d"", 'probably', 'vote', 'Carlos', 'Bernard', 'Tony', 'Almeida', 'unsung', 'hero', 'series', 'great', 'performance', 'show.The', 'writing', 'very', 'tight', 'dialogue', 'good', 'fact', 'phrases', 'hour', 'real', 'time', 'are', 'overused', 'Other', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'red', 'herrings', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'chugs', 'right', 'along', 'said', 'when', 'focus', 'mid-season', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'computer', 'disk', 'bit', 'letdown.Overall', 'very', 'good', 'television', 'show', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'season', 'second', 'still', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'especially', 'excellent', 'first', 'half']",24: Season 2

The real time gimmick is still a big enough gimmick that they seem to be coasting on it.And that's a pity. The writing in this second season of ""24"" is flabby, silly and typically telegraphed miles and miles off. Fans tuning in looking for edge of their seat thrills aren't going to find them here; they'd be better off switching from Fox to sister station FX and ""The Shield.""The very first hour telegraphs things that the characters will be blissfully ignorant of for several hours -- Hey, there's a conspiracy inside the White House to subvert the president's authority! Hey, this cartoonishly evil bully Kim works for isn't going to just let her get away with defying her authority! Jack is mad and he's a loose cannon!Plot elements seem to have been lifted from online fanfic: When running from the evil father, Kim runs, not into the crowded public street, but into an alley empty of people; Kim is an au pair instead of a nanny despite the fact that most people have no idea what an au pair is and despite the fact that she neither seems to be a foreign student nor a college student at all; an expensive sports car's trunk conveniently springs a leak in time for police to investigate the sudden gusher of blood despite the fact that even the cheapest car trunk won't drip a drop if you spill a 2 liter of soda back there (learned the hard way); no one seems capable of getting along with each other, and instead White House officials and intelligence agency officials alike have to snarl half-threats at each other and refuse to do even the most rudementary cooperation; this bizarre inability to connect with each other extends outside the workplace -- instead of calling up his estranged son and saying he's been badly hurt on the job, the humorously named George Mason has his son arrested and brought in wearing handcuffs, in a failed attempt to win the Father of the Year award.If they cut most of this nonsense out -- along with the entirely pointless Kim storyline -- the show would be half its length, which just might make it tight enough to watch.

Utilizing a novel premise, each season of 24 comprises a single day in lives of its characters, with each of the 24 episodes representing a one-hour time segment of that day. Kiefer Sutherland stars in the imminent role of Jack Bauer, a government agent periodically faced with enormous challenges within a single day. Each season is reminiscent of a fast-paced Hollywood action thriller, but it's only a busy day in the life of the heroic Bauer...Season 2 supposedly takes place eighteen months after Jack's big day in Los Angeles. Jack is now dealing with the death of his wife and is estranged from his daughter Kim. As a result, he contemplates retirement. But when President Palmer personally requests his help, Jack agrees to take on a new assignment. In so doing, Jack learns that a Middle-Eastern terrorist group called Second Wave is going to detonate a nuclear device in Los Angeles in the next 24 hours. Yet again the clock is ticking, and yet again, only Jack Bauer stands in the way of an evil conspiracy reaching its final fruition...The 24 (Season 2) DVD features a number of breathtaking episodes including the season premiere which begins with President Palmer and his son fishing in an Oregon lake when he's called away for an emergency. Ushered into an underground bunker, he learns of a terrorist plot to set off a nuclear weapon in the Los Angeles area in the next 24 hours. At the CIA's Counter Terrorism Unit, George Mason is ordered to contact Jack Bauer in respect to the case, but it takes the personal appeal of President Palmer to move Jack into action. Meanwhile Kim, working as a housekeeper/nanny, overhears a domestic dispute between her boss and his wife, and she locks herself and the man's daughter in a bedroom. As the episode concludes, Jack learns that the key to uncovering the whereabouts of the nuclear device may lie with a domestic terrorist organization he once infiltrated... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include (#31) in which Jack and Nina set up a sting to see if a contact can lead them to the site of the bomb, and (#46) in which Jack stands on the verge of making a break in the case but has his efforts thwarted by the president's ex-wife, who's involved in the terrorist conspiracy...The DVD Report",5,"An original, fast-paced series...",1114041600,"04 21, 2005",2005,2410,"['First', 'airing', 'November', '2001', '24', 'quickly', 'established', 'one', 'best', 'television', 'series', 'solidified', 'cult', 'classic', 'icon', 'Utilizing', 'novel', 'premise', 'season', '24', 'comprises', 'single', 'day', 'lives', 'characters', '24', 'episodes', 'representing', 'one-hour', 'time', 'segment', 'day', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'stars', 'imminent', 'role', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'government', 'agent', 'periodically', 'faced', 'enormous', 'challenges', 'single', 'day', 'season', 'reminiscent', 'fast-paced', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'thriller', 'only', 'busy', 'day', 'life', 'heroic', 'Bauer', 'Season', '2', 'supposedly', 'place', 'eighteen', 'months', 'Jack', 'big', 'day', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Jack', 'now', 'dealing', 'death', 'wife', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'Kim', 'result', 'retirement', 'when', 'President', 'Palmer', 'personally', 'help', 'Jack', 'take', 'new', 'assignment', 'so', 'doing', 'Jack', 'Middle-Eastern', 'terrorist', 'group', 'called', 'Second', 'Wave', 'going', 'detonate', 'nuclear', 'device', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'next', '24', 'hours', 'Yet', 'again', 'clock', 'ticking', 'yet', 'again', 'only', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'way', 'evil', 'conspiracy', 'reaching', 'final', 'fruition', '24', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'number', 'breathtaking', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'President', 'Palmer', 'son', 'fishing', 'Oregon', 'lake', 'when', 'called', 'away', 'emergency', 'Ushered', 'underground', 'bunker', 'terrorist', 'plot', 'set', 'off', 'nuclear', 'weapon', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'area', 'next', '24', 'hours', 'CIA', 'Counter', 'Terrorism', 'Unit', 'George', 'Mason', 'ordered', 'contact', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'respect', 'case', 'personal', 'appeal', 'President', 'Palmer', 'move', 'Jack', 'action', 'Meanwhile', 'Kim', 'working', 'housekeeper/nanny', 'domestic', 'dispute', 'boss', 'wife', 'man', 'daughter', 'bedroom', 'episode', 'Jack', 'key', 'uncovering', 'whereabouts', 'nuclear', 'device', 'may', 'lie', 'domestic', 'terrorist', 'organization', 'once', 'infiltrated', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '2', 'include', '31', 'Jack', 'Nina', 'set', 'up', 'sting', 'see', 'contact', 'can', 'lead', 'site', 'bomb', '46', 'Jack', 'verge', 'making', 'break', 'case', 'efforts', 'thwarted', 'president', 'ex-wife', 'who', 'involved', 'terrorist', 'conspiracy', 'DVD', 'Report']",24: Season 2

But the writers were not about to just give up on the show after one season. Kiefer Sutherland returns as Jack Bauer, and he is about to have his second bad day.It has been a year and half since the events of the first season. JACK BAUER (again played by Kiefer Sutherland) is still in grief over his wife's untimely death and he no longer works for CTU. He had quit after Teri's death. He and his daughter KIM BAUER (again played by Elisha Cuthbert) are estranged from each other, but they are trying to work out their relationship. Kim is working as a live-in nanny for a family, until she finds that the husband of the girl Kim is nannying turns out to be physically abusive to both his wife and daughter.After a brief visit to Kim, Jack receives a phone call from DAVID PALMER (again played by Dennis Haysbert). David is now in office, well has been for the last year and a half. He informs Jack that there are plans of a terrorist attack on L.A. The plan is to detonate a nuclear bomb over L.A. Jack returns to CTU and is greeted by TONY ALMEIDA (again played by Carlos Bernard) and GEORGE MASON (again played by Xander Berkeley). George is now the head of CTU. He has taken Jack's place after Jack had quit. After Nina Myers had been arrested and taken to jail for murdering Jack's wife, CTU has brought in a new employee to take Nina's place. Replacing Nina is MICHELLE DESSLER (played by the beautiful Reiko Aylesworth). She and Tony seem to have a personal interest in each other. Jack decides to help out Tony, George, and Michelle through the day.Off-hand, there is a family residing in L.A., they are the WARNER family. Mr. Warner resides in L.A. with his daughters, KATE WARNER (played by Sarah Wynter) and MARIE WARNER. Marie is getting married today. But all of that unfolds as CTU closes in on Marie's fiancee, Reza. But CTU finds that Reza is not involved with today's threat, for his fiancee...Marie...is the one involved, after they find out that she has killed Reza. Jack decides that Kate should help out CTU, whereas Kate agrees to help do anything to stop the threats from occuring.David has enough power to handle this day's threats, but he wants to bring in extra help. So, he decides to bring in SHERRY PALMER (again played by Penny Johnson Jerald), his ex-wife. All seems fine until Sherry stills shows signs of her being against David, rather than help him.Throughout the course of the day, CTU tries to locate the nuclear bomb. Jack finds that the person who authorized the location of this bomb is none other than...NINA MYERS (again played by Sarah Clarke). Nina has a lot of key information for CTU. She says she'll only help if she is allowed a presidental pardon. They allow it to her, with David's authorization, just so they can get rid of today's events. CTU locates the bomb, whereas Jack is the only one to plummit the bomb into the ground, destroying it. But to do that, Jack would have to be killed in the process of plummiting a helicopter. But George Mason has stellowayed on the chopper. Earlier, George had been infected with some sort of infectious gas, where he will die int he next 24 hours. He has Jack skydive out of the chopper, where George will take the plummit, since he's dying anyway.Saved by Mason's dying deed, Jack still has to find out the terrorists who are still trying to bring L.A. down. He finds Sherry Palmer with one of the men involved, but the man Sherry is meeting with kills himself, forcing Sherry to help Jack out with the leader of today's terrorists. Jack and Sherry successfully pull it off, whereas Tony and Michelle officially become an item, with Jack and Kim finally working things out between them, whereas Kim has killed the man she was working for, since he had tried killing her.The first season was extremely intense, but the season was even more intense than the first. I really enjoyed the season and you all will too. Get a copy of 24: Season Two.

749615,AZVEPWRYOFBX5,B00008YGRU,Charity Bishop,"[0, 0]","A man screams in agony as various tortures are inflicted on his flesh. He refuses to tell his tormentors anything until the pain becomes too great; he reaches his breaking point, and screams out what they want to hear. The information is rapidly taken to President David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert), on a fishing sojourn with his son. The recently elected, divorced politician and his media team are astounded and disturbed to discover that a nuclear bomb is planned to detonate sometime in the next 24 hours in the city of Los Angeles. Palmer orders a High Terrorist Watch and his staff contacts all agencies across the Midwest, alerting them to the danger. He has one request of the Counter Terrorist Agency in L.A to get Jack Bauer (Keifer Sutherland) on the case.A year after the devastating events surrounding the death of his wife, Jack Bauer has quit his job at the CTU. His daughter Kim (Elisha Cuthbert) is attempting to recover outside her fathers influence and now works as an au pair for a wealthy young couple in the suburbs. He refuses to become involved until a phone call from the president asks for his time and patience. He agrees to visit CTU and listen to a briefing by George Mason (Xander Berkeley), but promises nothing. When learning the truth, Jack refuses to assist them, instead making a phone call to persuade his daughter to get out of LA as swiftly as possible. While en route to his car, he sees a mother and her child walking along the street and changes his mind.Together with fellow agents Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard) and Michelle Dessler (Reiko Aylesworth), Jack is determined to stop this bomb from going off. He will have to go deep undercover, with serious consequences. The CTU is targeted, his life is placed in danger, and an involvement from high-class government shakes Palmers presidency. Numerous incidents are set to occur on this date, including the marriage of Marie Warner (Laura Harris) to an Arab-American. Her older sister Kate (Sarah Wynter) has never liked or trusted Reza and hires a private investigator to look into his financial accounts, fearing he may be embezzling from the country. What she finds instead drags her into the midst of chaos when CTU shows up on their doorstep. Kim also has serious problems when she discovers her employers husband has a penchant for domestic violence. She will stop at nothing to protect Megan (Skye McColle Bartusiak) even when it comes to kidnapping.As a television series, 24 is successful because you have time enough to digest each episode and await the next, but watched consecutively becomes increasingly more unbelievable. The concept that anyone could live through such an unholy amount of terror (kidnappings, beatings, shootings, car accidents, and torture sessions) in the course of a single day is just plain fabrication. The plot moves swiftly on some fronts, slowly on others. Kim's storyline is believable for the first half dozen episodes but then becomes predictable and slow: everywhere she goes, you know inevitably it'll turn wrong. She meets up with one psycho after another, some of them with dark intentions, others just unintentionally freaky. Palmers political end of the spectrum is intriguing enough for a while but then bogs down in endless plot twists. By the time an actual decision is made on whether or not to bomb foreign countries in retaliation, the viewer has grown tired of all the bantering. Poor Jack loses one snitch after another, goes through hellish torture experiences, and winds up carrying a full load. His story, and the trials of Michelle and Tony at the CTU, is the most interesting.Fans of the first season will be pleased to see some of the same characters back in the second, with a heavy dose of new faces to balance the familiar adrenalin-pumping episodes. George Mason, self-professed jerk, redeems himself. Tony goes through some morphs, being likable and yet villainous when it suits him best. Michelle is the most emotionally attractive character, and some conversations will bring even the most hardened viewer close to tears. This DVD collection is also much more charitable than the first where content is concerned. There's no outright sexual activity (there are implications), less profane language, and redeeming messages. The content is still grueling, the storyline rampant with unsavory torture scenes (usually the victim is stripped naked, but the camera is careful not to show too much), and many shoot-outs. In one of the first episodes, Jack delivers a severed head in a leather bag. Many people are shot and killed with gory results; the body count is extremely high.A dead woman's bloodstained body is found in a trunk; a man throws his little girl to the floor, hitting her head on the edge of the bed. Kim is forced to defend herself numerous times, taking a tire iron to a mans head and shooting another person dead. In the aftermath of rumors of attack, Americans are provoked to retaliate against innocent Arab citizens. Several men attack an Arab agent and beat him to death. Jack is forced to remove a computer chip from a dead mans body; the camera lingers on the blood. Television programs don't have anything higher than a TV14, but 24s violent and thematic content is closer to an R. The torture scenes are the most difficult to watch, as people are burned, stabbed, electrocuted, cut with electrical blades, and injected with various painful medications. My biggest problem with this is that most of the time, good guys are involved. I cannot condone torture under any circumstance, and do not take pleasure in seeing the hero use it, even for the good of the country.When an Arab refuses to give information, Jack beats him and then forces him to choose between his information and the life of his son. (SPOILERCTU did not kill his eldest child; it was staged to gain cooperation.) After shooting a female suspect in the arm, he refuses to give her pain medication and squeezes the wound to make her talk. He learns vital information from one man by telling him his death will be painless if he cooperates (the spy was injected with a slow-acting medication that makes his lungs collapse so he suffocates). Palmer also condones the torturing of a cabinet member in order to discern if he was in league with foreign terrorists. I also did not appreciate the obvious Bush Administration bashing in the last several episodes. There is also some language (mostly mild profanity and abuse of deity, although various characters use the term screwed and d*cked around once or twice).Carefully obscured nudity appears in the first episode and several thereafter. A woman intimates shell sleep with a man if hell give her something out of her boyfriends locker. They go into his office and close the door. Present are themes of racism, blackmail, brainwashing, and political corruption. A man is shown vomiting in one scene; another suffers from radiation poisoning with mildly gruesome results; a bomb goes off in a terrorist unit, killing fifteen people and wounding others. A woman is deliberately detained from going to the hospital in order to gain information, further jeopardizing her life. Kim is also locked in with a mentally deranged man who we fear might have aggressive intentions, but nothing comes of it. She's seen in a t-shirt and panties in her opening scene; her employers husband looks lustfully at her. Several times her tank top becomes mildly sheer.For die-hard action fans, 24 is fabulous. It has many twists and turns, emotional highs, and down-to-the-wire cliffhanger endings. But its also extremely violent, much of its subject matter is cruel, and many of its themes challenge the viewer to wonder when enough is enough do we condone torture in order to gain information, sacrifice one life to save thousands of others, or rationalize bad behavior? The means are just as important as the end. This is my primary fault with 24 they make out that as long as everything turns out all right, the means of getting there isn't important.",3,Parental Review,1363824000,"03 21,

749625,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B00008YGRU,Craig MACKINNON,"[8, 9]","The second season of 24 offers a more logical story than season 1.  There are less coincidences, fewer vanishing characters, and a tighter control on the overall plot.  For watching the show on DVD, unbroken by a week between episodes (not to mention advertising breaks), this is vital.  Sure, the series still suffers from some of the same coldly logical problems of Season 1, e.g. it seems you can get from anywhere in L.A. to anywhere else in 10 minutes or less, irrespective of the time of day.  But there are precious few other illogical happenings in this second series, which makes it more enjoyable (and easier to watch multiple times) than season 1.This plot this time: information comes to President David Palmer (last seen as a candidate for that office - obviously he won the election and is early in his tenure) that terrorists have a nuclear weapon.  Because the weapon will go off that day, and the series starts at 6 am, simple arithmatic tells you that the bomb will be discovered (or go off) on or before episode 18.  But the real story is not necessarily finding the bomb, but also finding out who is behind it.  At various stages we are led to suspect the following: a terrorist super-group (like al-Qiada) is responsible, the governments of several ""Middle Eastern"" countries are responsible, the bomb is actually a conspiracy in the U.S. government, the bomb is controlled by local (U.S.-led) terrorists.  And just because one possibility is apparently eliminated doesn't mean it won't come back later!  Into the situation is drafted Jack Bauer, still grieving over the murder of his wife at the end of Season 1.  Palmer personally orders Jack onto the case, and he proceeds with psychopathic glee to torture and murder his way through the case.This season is not for the squeamish.  There are a number of scenes of torture that are surprisingly graphic.  The subplots with Kim (Jack's daughter), are difficult to watch for a different reason - they are pointless and irritating.  Any terroists that act like these do would be caught in hours - they kidnap Americans, leave bodies lying around, etc.  Those are only minor strikes against the show, though.  Generally, the pace is hectic, the plots interesting, and you're left wanting more at the end of each hour.  Unfortunately, a bigger strike against this season is that there are 3 or 4 shows near the end (after we discover the fate of the bomb but before we discover who's responsible) where the writers are obviously just trying to fill time to reach 24 hours.  If this season was called ""21,"" it would have been vastly improved.  Finally, to avoid naming real countries, the producers rely on what they hope is geographical ignorance on the part of the viewer.  At one point, the origin of the terrorists is identified by a wave at a map of North Africa (say, Algeria-Libya), while later American bombers are having to pass over Turkey on the way to their targets, which would be impossible if the targets were the previously identified Libya or Algeria.A lot of these issues will only be noticed by DVD viewers like me who watched the entire series over the course of a month, rather than over the 8 month TV schedule.  I make no apologies for that, since this is a DVD review!  Speaking of which, this package contains many extras, much more than Season 1, and some of them are quite good.  The highlights for me are featurette on the effects of blowing up the CTU office, and the commentary that includes the actress who plays Nina.",4,"More logical than Season 1 (and better), but a few hours too long",1158883200,"09 22, 2006",2006,3516,"['second', 'season', '24', 'offers', 'more', 'logical', 'story', 'season', '1', 'are', 'less', 'coincidences', 'fewer', 'vanishing', 'characters', 'tighter', 'control', 'overall', 'plot', 'watching', 'show', 'DVD', 'unbroken', 'week', 'episodes', 'not', 'mention', 'advertising', 'breaks', 'vital', 'Sure', 'series', 'still', 'same', 'coldly', 'logical', 'problems', 'Season', '1', 'e.g', 'can', 'get', 'anywhere', 'L.A.', 'anywhere', 'else', '10', 'minutes', 'less', 'irrespective', 'time', 'day', 'are', 'precious', 'few', 'other', 'illogical', 'happenings', 'second', 'series', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'easier', 'watch', 'multiple', 'times', 'season', '1.This', 'plot', 'time', 'information', 'President', 'David', 'Palmer', 'last', 'seen', 'candidate', 'office', 'obviously', 'won', 'election', 'early', 'tenure', 'terrorists', 'have', 'nuclear', 'weapon', 'weapon', 'will', 'go', 'off', 'day', 'series', '6', 'am', 'simple', 'arithmatic', 'tells', 'bomb', 'will', 'be', 'discovered', 'go', 'off', 'episode', '18', 'real', 'story', 'not', 'necessarily', 'finding', 'bomb', 'also', 'finding', 'out', 'who', 'various', 'stages', 'are', 'led', 'suspect', 'following', 'terrorist', 'super-group', 'al-Qiada', 'responsible', 'governments', 'several', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'countries', 'are', 'responsible', 'bomb', 'actually', 'conspiracy', 'U.S.', 'government', 'bomb', 'controlled', 'local', 'U.S.-led', 'terrorists', 'just', 'one', 'possibility', 'apparently', 'eliminated', ""n't"", 'mean', 'wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'back', 'later', 'situation', 'drafted', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'still', 'grieving', 'murder', 'wife', 'end', 'Season', '1', 'Palmer', 'personally', 'orders', 'Jack', 'case', 'psychopathic', 'glee', 'torture', 'murder', 'way', 'case.This', 'season', 'not', 'squeamish', 'are', 'number', 'scenes', 'torture', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'graphic', 'subplots', 'Kim', 'Jack', 'daughter', 'are', 'difficult', 'watch', 'different', 'reason', 'are', 'pointless', 'irritating', 'terroists', 'act', 'do', 'would', 'be', 'caught', 'hours', 'kidnap', 'Americans', 'leave', 'bodies', 'lying', 'around', 'etc', 'are', 'only', 'minor', 'strikes', 'show', 'though', 'Generally', 'pace', 'hectic', 'plots', 'interesting', ""'re"", 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'end', 'hour', 'Unfortunately', 'bigger', 'strike', 'season', 'are', '3', '4', 'shows', 'end', 'discover', 'fate', 'bomb', 'discover', 'who', 'responsible', 'where', 'writers', 'are', 'obviously', 'just', 'trying', 'fill', 'time', 'reach', '24', 'hours', 'season', 'was', 'called', '21', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'vastly', 'improved', 'Finally', 'avoid', 'naming', 'real', 'countries', 'producers', 'rely', 'what', 'hope', 'geographical', 'ignorance', 'part', 'viewer', 'one', 'point', 'origin', 'terrorists', 'identified', 'wave', 'map', 'North', 'Africa', 'say', 'Algeria-Libya', 'later', 'American', 'bombers', 'are', 'having', 'pass', 'over', 'Turkey', 'way', 'targets', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'targets', 'were', 'previously', 'identified', 'Libya', 'Algeria.A', 'lot', 'issues', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'noticed', 'DVD', 'viewers', 'who', 'watched', 'entire', 'series', 'course', 'month', 'rather', '8', 'month', 'TV', 'schedule', 'make', 'apologies', 'DVD', 'review', 'Speaking', 'package', 'many', 'extras', 'much', 'more', 'Season', '1', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'highlights', 'are', 'featurette', 'effects', 'blowing', 'up', 'CTU', 'office', 'commentary', 'actress', 'who', 'Nina']",24: Season 2

Although in my country have yet to be aired, I just can't wait and get this DVD Boxset... and finally, after watching the entire run of Season Two... this is the best season out of 2 I have seen this year!!!Season Two has become much faster, better and crazier compare to Season One. It has a simple story to start with - there is a bomb in United States of America. Enter Jack Bauer, grieving at what he has lost in Season One and had resign from CTU. But the President Palmer needs him to locate that bomb... and its another 24 hour run of his life... that almost nearly kill him.I have to admit, this is the best Season Two I have watched. This time I didn't get sick. Watching all 24 episodes had me up and reeling for more. It has the action any TV fan would want. It has the story anyone will enjoy. And most of all, the intensity of the story that grips you from beginning to the end.With the extras of over 40 deleted scenes, 2 featurettes plus other extra stuff, you can't go wrong with this season.

I'm so glad they are putting these episodes out quickly.  I was a &quot;johnny-come-lately&quot;, panning the first season and tuning in for the second season on a whim.  I was hooked with the first episode and couldn't get enough.  Thankfully, at the time I started watching, Season One was out on dvd, so I bought it and caught up on Jack Bauer's adventures.  Now, I'm jonesing for Season Three but in the meantime I have this new dvd set to enjoy with lots of interesting features, such as 44 deleted scenes, commentary and featurettes that make this 7 disc set a worthy addition to your collection.  Jack's next horrific day on the job starts with the threat of an atomic bomb smuggled into Los Angeles by an international terrorist organization.  This sets of a chain of reactions that become one spell binding turn after another.  I won't go into much detail about what happens but you'll be biting your nails by the end of each episode.  Keifer Sutherland is great as Jack Bauer, the CTU agent that can handle almost ANY situation.  Dennis Haysbert is perfect as David Palmer, a very charasmatic President, who uses Agent Bauer when he gets into a tight spot.  My personal favorite, Penny Johnson, as the delightfully sneaky and scheming, Sherry Palmer, is back for Season Two, adding plenty of guessing and twists for the fans.  Daughter Kim is back too (played by Elisha Cuthbert) stumbling into trouble and keeping her dad busy trying to save her, as well as the entire city of Los Angeles.

749638,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B00008YGRU,"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL""","[4, 5]","I'm always amazed to see it come together. Because so many times, you're so close to it that it doesn't seem like it's going to be very good."" If you've seen even a couple of episodes of Fox's ""real time"" series 24, you likely won't be surprised to hear that Carlos Bernard, who plays Tony Almeida, has a sense of humor and humility. Still, it's entertaining to hear him yuk it up with costars Sarah Wynter (who plays hapless but incredibly gritty bystander Kate Warner) and Michelle Forbes (Presidential Assistant Lynne Kresge), as they watch the fourth episode (""11am-12pm"") for Fox's second season DVD collection.Over the 45 minutes, the three remark on one another's good or bad hair, enthuse about their camera people and writers, call star Kiefer Sutherland ""the Keifernator,"" and joke about the show's lapses into convention (""Look at this guy with his arm!"" Bernard giggles when he spots corny behavior by a victim of the explosion at CTU [Counter Terrorism Unit], at whose offices much of the show is set). From the sounds of it, they actually like working on this show.And no wonder. The series not only takes on a timely subject -- ongoing and organized terrorist threats against the U.S., this season set in L.A., where a nuclear bomb is set to explode -- but it also treats its performers with unusual care, granting them unusually lengthy onscreen minutes in which to build characters. Indeed, it is somewhat amazing,"" to borrow Bernard's term, to consider that the show commences production each season with only six or so episodes written, that the confluence of events and storylines is only imagined late in the season, that the actors don't exactly know who will survive or not; on one of the DVD set's documentaries, a casting director says she tells agents wondering about character arcs, ""If you don't die, you can come back."" Still, it does ""come together"" and make for compelling tv, and despite the Perils of Kim (Elisha Cuthbert).The new DVD set is certainly well outfitted (especially compared to the notoriously no-frills first season), with commentary tracks on six episodes (some more engaged than others), and a seventh disc with two documentaries, ""On The Button: The Destruction Of CTU"" (in which FX Coordinator Stan Blackwell dryly observes, ""You don't want too much Styrofoam flying when you do an explosion, 'cause it's so light. Nothing ruins a frame more than one piece of fluttering concrete coming down like a leaf""); and a two-part documentary, ""24 Exposed,"" about the making of the final two episodes (with a focus on the shootout and fighting between Jack and an array of feisty villains).This in addition to 49 deleted scenes and alternate takes, and the original extended version season premiere, which remains excellent, even on repeated viewing: the moment when Jack, sullen and short-tempered following his wife's murder last season, shoots that slimy suspect point blank in the chest is seriously disconcerting. As George Mason (Xander Berkley) looks on, appropriately aghast, Jack instructs him, ""That's the problem with people like you, George. You want results, but you never want to get your hands dirty... I'm gonna need a hacksaw."" (As producer Joel Surnow pronounces, ""This is a red meat show. People kill people and go eat a sandwich right after."")The season had much to live up to, given that the first was critically lauded, but took some time to gather a broad audience (this process including the repurposing of episodes on Fox's sister network, FX, such that 24 was available to view, for a few months anyway, repeatedly (though not nearly so often as the Law & Order behemoth or Seinfeld reruns, for that matter). Jack's transformation from morally upright hard worker to singular angry ex-agent is efficiently conveyed in the first episode, ""8am-9am,"" as he appears, ""inactive,"" walking away from the camera in a split screen, next to Tony walking toward the camera. Grizzled, flannel-shirted, and stalking his daughter, Jack's still suffering from the traumatic events 18 months earlier, but NSA calls him in anyway, as he's the only guy with a remote chance to respond usefully to a ""domestic terrorist alert,"" a nuclear device timed to go off within 24 hours. Of course he's the only guy. He's Jack Bauer.The ""domestic"" aspect of this terror always works across boundaries in 24 -- the private and public domains are continually collapsing here. As Forbes notes, ""Read it on paper, and you expect it to be like heightened melodrama,"" but, between Jack's job at CTU (however reluctantly he returns to it) and the extraordinary/daily crises faced by President David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert), the series neatly inserts imminent, global catastrophes. As Forbes notes, the directors work this line repeatedly and unusually, for television: ""Here,"" she says, ""they let the camera rest on all of these characters' faces, and they let their eyes speak what isn't being said."" It's a productive way to exploit tv close-ups, as well as these particular actors, all great faces. (As director Jon Cassar puts it during his commentary, ""It's all about the faces, the looks, the raised eyebrows. We don't need the visual eye candy that other shows have"").This season's plot, as Sutherland notes in ""24 Exposed,"" runs more or less (and often uncomfortably) parallel to current headlines, except, as the politically outspoken Sutherland offers, ""Our show is about trying to stop a war; our country, unfortunately, is at war."" During shooting (much of it in Toronto), cast and crew were only too aware of these correspondences (""It was just hitting a little too close to home,"" says Forbes), and the series made its own (sometimes subtle, sometimes not) assessments of the wrong-headedness of U.S. administration policies.Such assessments are most plainly realized in the terrorist plot, in which Second Wave, a group ""officially not recognized by any of the Middle Eastern States,"" threatens to explode a bomb in downtown L.A. This sucks in everyone at the office, including Paula (Sara Gilbert, who is terrific) and Michelle (equally sharp Reiko Aylesworth), who brilliantly juggles her part in the ticking bomb plot, her daughterish relation to George, and her growing attraction to self-interested Tony.The series also handles politics in a slightly offset way, for instance, in the supposed wedding between pert Marie Warner (Laura Harris, currently making charming trouble in Dead Like Me) and Reza Naiyeer (Phillip Rhys), the latter introduced speaking Arabic on his cell while speeding along in his red convertible, that is, just asking to be profiled by viewers, up until the point that he walks up behind his fianc&eacute;e accompanied by vaguely menacing music. Wynter says in her commentary, ""I think it was really gutsy for [the terrorist] to turn out not to be [Reza], but my very white, very blond, very privileged, very cheerleading kind of sister."" (At which point Bernard adds, if only he knew she was a cheerleader, Tony ""woulda been mackin' on her."")Other commentaries include the one over ""3-4am,"" by Sutherland and Surnow, which solicits my favorite comment of the whole package, from Sutherland: watching a series of images sans Jack: ""When I look at these scenes, it's just other people, other people, other people, just waiting for Jack"" (he hurries to declare this a joke, in case you're wondering). Another commentary, for ""1pm-2pm,"" features Cassar (who directed 10 episodes this year) and Sarah Clarke, who plays Nina (to file under gossipy trivia, she is recently married to the terrific Xander Berkley, whom she met on last year's set). Like everyone else, they discuss their affection for the series structure (Clarke likes ""the constant storylines coming at you"") as well as the episode in which Jack first confronts Nina (murderer of his wife), specifically, the smart use of surveillance monitors and window or doorframes to mark the tension and confusion caused by her re-appearance at CTU. ""It's like two fighters,"" Clarke says, watching Jack and Nina square off in a sequence of unnerving close-ups, ""Round after round.""The season's other brilliant return belongs to Sheri (Penny Johnson Jerald), with machinations as sinister as before. This complex, powerful woman can do anything, it's clear, the ethical and emotional arrangements in her own mind are always breathtakingly focused on her relationship to that man she loves. At the same time, Sheri is part of the show's commitment to intelligent and politicized casting; watching a scene with characters of color, Johnson Jerald notes during her commentary track, ""This is the beauty of 24 here, in terms of casting. I enjoy it when I see people who look like me and look like other people and represent the full spectrum of people, without making a big deal out of it.""Definitely less well rounded, much like last season, Kim's annoying storyline stumbles from calamity to calamity. Again, she's caught up in serial dangers, so that her box is always about to break out into chaos: dashing about in her tight little top, she's always in dire need of Jack's help (that said, she does eventually come into her own, and proves wholly capable of the sort of ""red meat"" violence for which her father is infamous). Still, she tends to distract him from whatever latest international fire he's forced to put out (as Johnson Jerald says, ""Look at the difference between Dennis and Kiefer, just in terms of the manly look. You have this clean-cut, very Presidential man with power, and then this rugged look of this man who's going to save the day). Working as a nanny for a little girl whose father is abusing her, Kim escapes with the help of her gorgeous beau Miguel (pop star Innis Casey), runs right into the arms of hard-charging head case Kevin Dillon, then has to deal with the apparent fact that her father is playing Slim Pickens on a nuclear warhead. Again, he's the only guy. He's Jack Bauer.As Jack careens from mishap to tragedy, he's set off against the President, who behaves in the noblest manner imaginable, no matter what disasters head his way. Haysbert describes his performance this way: ""I live in a world where there are no accidents."" It's an apt way of looking at the responsibility Palmer shoulders (Haysbert says he models the character on Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and Colin Powell, and does his best, even off set, to seem a role model; ""My personal belief,"" he says in his incredible voice, ""Is that I have to maintain a certain footing.""Leave it to Sheri to see though this gallant posture, as when she confronts Jack with his own only guyness, his lonely absolutism, in the final episode, ""7-8am."" ""You're a very impressive man, Jack, but you see everything as either good or bad, just like David. And the world is so much more complicated than that."" 24 appreciates these complications, even if it might wish Jack is right. It reveals dangers from within the U.S. administration (emerging from corruption and ineptitude equally), from within the perfect Southern Californian family, from within those ""corporate interests"" propped up by government policies. It also gives you a hero, but he's mad about it.",5,24 Season 2 (DVD),1139788800,"02 13, 2006",2006,11176,"[""'m"", 'always', 'amazed', 'see', 'come', 'together', 'so', 'many', 'times', ""'re"", 'so',

For ages afterward something was bothering me about this series and when I figured out what it was it made me a happy man, so I'd like to share it with the community. It's this: Kim. Yes she's perky, yes she's wholesome, but she also happens to be every Friday the 13th rolled into one. I mean, accused of murder and kidnapping, involved in a near-fatal car crash and a gas-station siege and then held hostage by a millenial wack-job, all on a day when her father specifically told her to stay out of trouble? The cougar was just the icing. What I did when I figured this out was, I went back and watched the whole thing again, skipping right past all the Kim-related tomfoolery - it was way shorter and roughly about a million times better, trust me, try it out.

With season 2, we finally get to see Jack in full hard a** mode.

He also attains somewhat ridiculous but enduring superman powers, surviving plenty of near death and yes (spoiler alert) even full death experiences with out much damage. OK. Not very likely. It's even silly at times. But overall,  it's entertaining. Far more entertaining than the first season. Newbies might just want to skip the first season entirely and start here.

Buy when I checked out season two, I was hooked all over again. Not only is the season more interesting, it involves issues that our world is currently dealing with. Not only that, but the action has been pumped up 400%, that acting keeps getting better, and Jack (Keifer Sutherland) is one of the best characters to follow on TV.With the finale just around the corner, and a new third season on the way, I think it is safe to say this DVD is a perfect buy for any fan of the show, or anybody who missed its initial run and wants to see what all the hype is about. Surely it will have many more special features than season 1 did, since the first season DVD was produced and created in about 2 months. Most likely as well as the stuff season one's had, like preview for season three, and quite possibly an alernate ending. Hopefully they will put in some commentaries in the mix as well.But anyway.....Fox is doing a great job with their TV on DVD lately.

Season 1 did have violence and cruelty, but it was mostly suggested, not shown in a graphic manner.  Season 2, however, opens by showing severe torturing of a man to get information, showing the method and how much pain he was in.  It was disturbing.

749648,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,B00008YGRU,D. Mok,"[64, 72]","Season Two is the true test of this show's mettle.  Can 24 sustain itself now that the novelty of its groundbreaking real-time conceit has worn off?The answer is yes.  24's writers and producers are smart enough to know that it wasn't so much the real-time aspect which connected with people, but the array of insurmountable obstacles and impossible odds with which Jack Bauer is faced episode after episode, as befits a good suspense thriller.Season Two's nuclear-bomb plot is much more ambitious than Season One.  And yes, there comes a point in the middle where the action lapses quite badly, when the threat of detonation diminishes.  And the show underutilizes Jack's character for a good four, five episodes -- a mistake.  It's Kiefer Sutherland's edgy, aggressive portrayal of this dogged, often morally questionable character that anchors the tone of the show, and the first quarter of the show has far too much Kate Warner (Sarah Wynter) and not enough jack Bauer.The Kate Warner subplot, while a good one in conception, goes awry in execution for a good 50 per cent of the show.  Sarah Wynter does an adequate job, but every single character in this subplot remains paper-thin up until the midpoint of the season.  It's like the gooey family love-in in Season One without the physical danger.  Since the characters have no weight (Laura Harris as Marie Warner is especially irritating), their fussy interactions also ring hollow, especially ranked alongside Jack's apocalyptic nuclear threat and even the Kim Bauer kidnapping subplot.  Once Kate and Jack meet and she is incorporated into the conspiracy through-line, she becomes a much better character and Wynter's appeal comes through.Sutherland remains the center of everything, befittingly.  The loss of Sarah Clarke in the main cast does hurt; Reiko Aylesworth does a fine job as replacement Michelle Dessler, but she just doesn't have Clarke's arresting presence.  Fans of Season One looking for closure in the Nina Myers subplot can stop looking -- Season Two gives Clarke a wonderful opportunity to chew scenery and play an insidious villainess and Clarke is terrific in this role, but don't expect any attempt to explain just how Nina Myers went from saintly sidekick to vicious double agent.  Elisha Cuthbert continues to impress with acting nuances uncommon among actresses her age; she's a pro at making interesting choices at emotional moments.  Dennis Haysbert is stately and subtly powerful as President Palmer, and happily, Penny Johnson Jerald as Sherry Palmer is given a more human dimension in the scripts, rather than the blindly destructive saboteur of Season One, and Jerald rises to the occasion.  The best performance of the season, however, belongs to Xander Berkeley.  Finally this fine actor is given a character arc worthy of his abilities, and Berkeley's portrayal of George Mason's metamorphosis is emotionally devastating, while retaining the character's defining irreverence and scuzziness.  I wonder why he was locked out of the Emmys?Suffice to say that I stayed up for another 20 hours straight watching this thing.  This show has a hypnotic quality not found in any other, and you can bet I'll be first in line for Season Three -- especially since Season Two ends on the mother of all cliffhangers.

If you are not among that crowd, watch that season before you even think about watching this one********24's second season find's Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) ready for another day that's bad beyond my ability to convey. When we first catch up with Jack, we find him no longer employed at CTU, and alienated from his daughter Kim (Elisha Cuthbert), who's recently begun caring for an abused child with a psychopathic father. Jack is quickly called back to work when President Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) and his aides learn there is a nuclear bomb somewhere in L.A. set to go off that very day. Palmer, himself, is forced to deal with a possible conspiracy against him, and the return of his not-so-pleasant ex-wife, Sherry (Penny Johnson-Jerald). George Mason (Xander Berkeley) now heads CTU, with Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard) working just under him, as well as several new faces. Meanwhile, Kate Warner (Sarah Wynter) suspects her sister's husband-to-be may be involved with terrorists.24's second season features just as much action and suspense as season one, and even improves upon the previous season in some respects. The entire season seems to have been planned in advance this time around, so almost all of the plot developments fit together nicely and make perfect sense. Some of these twists will surprise the hell out of you, and even the ones that won't will please because the show is well-written and well-acted.The only thing that keeps these episodes from earning five stars is Kim Bauer's plot line, which is like an extended bad dream. Whereas all of the other plots come together, Kim just seems to be in the mix because the writers/producers wanted to keep the character around. The scenes involving Kim (with the notable exception of one involving a disturbing phone call from her father) all distract more than anything else. This is not to say it was in any way actress Elisha Cuthbert's fault-the writers simply should have found a way to work her into the plot better. As it is, a series of unbelievable mini-disasters happen to Kim.Still, her role is thankfully kept to a minimum and won't ruin an otherwise A+ television series.

Even when it's not necessarily my personal favorite, I think that it's objectively the best.The reason is that it has so much in common with the stock blockbuster disaster thriller (e.g., Armageddon, Independence Day), namely in the way it goes from all these disparate groups of people who are brought together by the potential disastrous event; and it also is the most, as it were, ""Clancyesque"" of the seasons.  I always note how most action movies start right here, where the ex-agent has suffered some great loss before now, which is alluded to but we do not actually see -- yet in the case of 24, we have seen it, and thus does Day1 function as a sort of prequel -- and is the reason why he retired, yet he is called back in For This One Assignment, because no one else can.  And Jack Bauer's role in this is just so much more ""Leader of the Pack"" rather than his later adventures, which often remind me of Die Hard (viz., after Day3) -- not that they are worse or better on that account (I love Die Hard(s)), but just different.I've also noticed that Sean Callery's music, something about the way he arranges it in this particular season, is way more intense than most seasons.

But this is pre-Abu Graib, when the US government thought that torture (and extraordinary rendition) was a justifiable way of averting calamity. The producers of 24 take up this theme with a vengeance, and Jack Bauer dies at least once in this story, although you know that he gets resurrected, otherwise there couldn't be a series 3, 4 and 5, could there?The story is better than the first series in the sense that it is one continuous plot. (Series One suffers from a big change of story, pace and production team after episode #14.) But in order to keep Kimberley Bauer in the story, she is subjected to a series of adventures almost wholly unrelated to the main nuclear-bomb story yet which happen coincidentally on the same day. The girl she looks after is incredibly annoying, by the way. But if you want to target a teenage audience, I guess you have to have some teenage characters.There are some highly unlikely turnarounds during this 24-hour period. A president gets replaced then reinstated. His ex-wife worms her way back into his bunker, then gets expelled, then becomes a virtual heroine. The top baddies seem perfectly happy to switch their plans at the last moment from a start-a-Middle-Eastern-war strategy to an assassinate-the-president plan. The aspect that perhaps the director does best is the no-sex relationship developments. Tony and Michelle look early on as if they're going to get it together, but by the end, they both know they're too damned tired. And Jack and the woman he rescues develop an understanding, without any need to hop into bed before the day is out.

In the last few months, I've picked up a few shows, but in the 5 years previous to that there wasn't a single drama that I watched with any regularity.  (This would be dating back to when the 'X-Files' went to hell, and when I determined that 'Millenium' was too goddamn depressing.)  Well actually, I still haven't ever watched '24' on TV, just the DVD's, and I don't really know if I'd have all that much patience for just watching a single episode a week.  But, suffice to say, watching it on DVD is damn fun.  Yeah, yeah, this show is ridiculously implausible, and the flashy style rarely adds anything to it, but it makes you watch more.  So, it works.Entertaining though season 1 was, season 2 is a vast improvement.  Season 1 tended to be extremely unfocused and meandering, whereas season 2 is much more tightly plotted.  And, it also earns points for being willing to do things that you wouldn't anticipate. (i.e. kill important characters)  A few of the plot twists are kinda obnoxiously ludicrous, but this sorta thing is only a passing annoyance, and comes with the territory.  Performances are generally very strong, with the notable exception of Elisha Cuthbert, who's pretty ehh.  But, she's real purty, so I forgive her.  Special note goes to Kiefer Sutherland, mainly because he pretty much pulls off the whole badass image he's trying to create here, despite the fact that he's more naturally inclined to be a dork.

Dealing with the tragic death of his wife, Jack Bauer isknow confronted with more terrible news that sets up another plot for a 24 hour race against the clock.

The characters are intact  and  even showcase symptoms of true heroism. Sarah Wynter's addition to the cast was magnificent.

It's also extraordinary to note that the writers never fail to deliver its charge of rapid resistance  and vital suspense.The season 2 box set is filled heavily.

Everything about this plot was stupid and implausible. It was so frustrating to watch I can't even put it into words.My opinion is skip this season all together. The funny thing is, they duplicate this exact plot in season 6, like literally it's the exact same thing that happens to David Palmer's brother.

But his mourning is put on hold when The President of The United States reactivates him as an agent for the Las Angelos Counter Terrorist Unit. Bauer learns of a nuclear threat against the city and that one of his old covers will lead him to those who are first implicated. Except once assuming his old cover, Bauer discovers that there is someone more powerful behind the detination of the nuclear bomb. And the clock is ticking....This time around, Kiefer Sutherland not only assumes the role of Jack Bauer, but also as the show's co-executive producer. It is quite an impact on this season. Sutherland's character is not as essential as it was in the previous year. There are numerous sub-stroylines with countless characters, and they take away the focus of the main story. Kim Bauer is even more of an airhead in this season, and she really did not even have to be in the story. She is just there to take up time. There are other characters that do this, but not nearly as bad as Kim Bauer. The real problem with this season, is that the writers tried to out-do the previous year with more conflicts for the characters. This does not work so well, for the issues arise and are soon dropped with no true relevance to the main story. This causes the show to loose its feel of a film, even with it still in Real-Time Format.

749684,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00008YGRU,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","Twenty-four hours of television for one series, with advertising, slightly shorter without, thanks God. The series is a perfect thrilling adventure and till the last minute we do not know the end, and I won't tell it. The situation is political and it explores, under G.W. Bush, what should be done, hence should have been done after 9/11, in the case of a  nuclear international crisis, what's more a nuclear attack on the US territory. First the President is black and the vice-president is white. The president divorced his wife and she hates it and wants his head. That makes the plot very thick if not frankly sick. A nuclear bomb is smuggled into the US and will eventually explode though not in the midst of Los Angeles as initially planned. A tape is delivered that seems to prove a meeting took place in Cyprus between the representatives of three Middle East states and a terrorist organization. The President organizes the response, including a military immediate strike against the three countries concerned by the tape. The tape is validated by all services, though one agent of the main security agency has doubts and events little by little convince him that the tape is a fake. The President trusts him and thus keepts the military action going but stops the final strike that will have to wait for the result of Jack Bauer's research and mission.  The whole series is very good because the story line is systematically disturbed and warped by new elements making the target evasive. The warmonger is the Vice President, an allusion to Cheney, and the main argument is that military action cannot be decided on the basis of any information or evidence if there is a doubt about it. Any doubt must freeze the action and dynamize the work of all security services to explore that doubt. The twenty-fifth amendment to the US Constitution is largely used in the last hours of this day and it shows some are ready to use it to block a debate or even an investigation in order to make a military decision, which is apolitical decision, inescapable. The series does not try to really discuss the validity of the procedure but shows how in some circumstances the amendment can be manipulated by some to side-track the President himself. In other words the series shows us that the very Constitution of the US contains some loops that could be used by a clan to impose their power. At the same time the series tries to reassure us about such situations that are exceptional and in a way negotiable.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID",5,High Treason knows many ways,1272585600,"04 30, 2010",2010,2639,"['Twenty-four', 'hours', 'television', 'one', 'series', 'advertising', 'slightly', 'shorter', 'thanks', 'God', 'series', 'perfect', 'thrilling', 'adventure', 'till', 'last', 'minute', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'situation', 'political', 'G.W', 'Bush', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'hence', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'done', '9/11', 'case', 'nuclear', 'international', 'crisis', 'what', 'more', 'nuclear', 'attack', 'US', 'territory', 'First', 'President', 'black', 'vice-president', 'white', 'president', 'divorced', 'wife', 'head', 'plot', 'very', 'thick', 'not', 'frankly', 'sick', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'smuggled', 'US', 'will', 'eventually', 'explode', 'not', 'midst', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'initially', 'planned', 'tape', 'delivered', 'prove', 'meeting', 'took', 'place', 'Cyprus', 'representatives', 'three', 'Middle', 'East', 'states', 'terrorist', 'organization', 'President', 'response', 'including', 'military', 'immediate', 'strike', 'three', 'countries', 'concerned', 'tape', 'tape', 'validated', 'services', 'one', 'agent', 'main', 'security', 'agency', 'doubts', 'events', 'little', 'little', 'convince', 'tape', 'fake', 'President', 'thus', 'keepts', 'military', 'action', 'going', 'final', 'strike', 'will', 'have', 'wait', 'result', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'research', 'mission', 'whole', 'series', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'line', 'systematically', 'disturbed', 'warped', 'new', 'elements', 'making', 'target', 'evasive', 'warmonger', 'Vice', 'President', 'allusion', 'Cheney', 'main', 'argument', 'military', 'action', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'decided', 'basis', 'information', 'evidence', 'doubt', 'doubt', 'must', 'freeze', 'action', 'dynamize', 'work', 'security', 'services', 'explore', 'doubt', 'twenty-fifth', 'amendment', 'US', 'Constitution', 'largely', 'used', 'last', 'hours', 'day', 'are', 'ready', 'use', 'block', 'debate', 'even', 'investigation', 'order', 'make', 'military', 'decision', 'apolitical', 'decision', 'inescapable', 'series', 'not', 'try', 'really', 'discuss', 'validity', 'procedure', 'how', 'circumstances', 'amendment', 'can', 'be', 'manipulated', 'side-track', 'President', 'other', 'words', 'series', 'very', 'Constitution', 'US', 'loops', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'clan', 'impose', 'power', 'same', 'time', 'series', 'reassure', 'such', 'situations', 'are', 'exceptional', 'way', 'negotiable.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Paris', '8', 'Saint', 'Denis', 'University', 'Paris', '12', 'Cr', 'eacute', 'CEGID']",24: Season 2

The tale revolves around an imminent threat to Los Angeles, prompting a collection of L.A.'s best agents -- and a woman who ends up getting some crucial information -- to unite in an attempt to counter it, and afterwards, a desperate effort to prevent a misdirected retaliatory strike by the U.S.This is the season in which the show hits its stride, doing plenty of notable things and doing them quite well.Character:We're introduced to Michelle Dessler -- who would go on to become the greatest heroine in '24' history. We've also got the development of Tony Almeida's true character in this season, which marked the beginning of his becoming the show's secondary male hero. We glimpse a very sympathetic side of George Mason, get Jack at his ever-driven finest, and before it's all over, we even see Sherry taken full circle.Writing:There are some great lines from David Palmer, particularly at the end, and without giving too much away, there's a very touching scene between George and his son this season, while the last scenes between George and Jack stand out as well. One of the most memorable lines comes when Jack comments that the thing about terrorists is that they want to blame the rest of the world for everything wrong with their lives.Action:Jack vs. Wald's group, the CTU bust just outside of L.A., Kate going undercover, and a simply amazing season finale are some of the highlights in this area.Romance:For a series that abounds in but isn't mainly centered around personal relationships, the romance you'll find between Jack and Kate in this one season is better written than that of some shows that actually are romantic dramas. Even now, it remains by far the most cleverly constructed and interesting one that the protagonist has ever been given. Like Jack's relationship with Teri, it worked because, throughout the day, it was in a stage of development.

749695,A1EBJ93E1T50RT,B00008YGRU,Jason A. Miller,"[3, 5]","I'll always have special affection for the second season of ""24"", because it was the first season I watched.  I knew the general outlines of the first season: events occur in real time, Dennis Hopper with a bad accent, Pedro Cerrano from ""Major League"" as a Presidential candidate, Jack's wife died in the last scene, etc.  I didn't see a single frame of any of that until years later.  Season 2 is when I actually started watching.Season 2 has a graver threat than Season 1: a nuclear bomb is set to go off in Los Angeles.  There's a whole Presidential administration to run, not just a campaign.  Jack has more at stake this time: not only is his daughter Kim still getting in danger every hour, but he also has to put his own life back on track.  As with season 1, there are several villains who appear sequentially, with Nina Myers making a vicious return, and the froggy-throated girl from Nickelodeon's ""Fifteen"" showing up as a sleeper-cell terrorist maniac.  Another Jack -- from ""Lost"" -- doesn't get into the act, but his TV dad (John Terry) does.The focus of the season shifts over the last two discs from the bomb blast to a threatened reprisal against three Middle Eastern countries.  What's fascinating here is that an idealist President refuses to rush into war because he suspects he's been supplied with faulty intelligence -- and all this played out in prime time in early 2003 as the war in Iraq was beginning on the basis of intelligence that also may have been doctored.If there's a weak spot to this year of ""24"", it may be Kim Bauer.  In Season 1, the threat against Jack extended to his family, so Kim's weekly perils usually tied back to the main plot.  In Season 3, a more mature Kim worked at CTU and dated Jack's sidekick, so, again, never far from the main plot.  In Season 2, however, Kim's efforts to escape the blast radius are thwarted by the increasingly bizarre obstacles the producers throw in her way: an over-the-top boss who's not just a murderer, but a pervert, too; a creepy poacher living alone in the woods; an inexperienced gunman holding up a convenience store; and a cougar.  Even Kim's boyfriend this season gets into the act: after surviving a car wreck in which, apart from a bloody nose, he is not shown to have any injuries at all, he returns in a hospital bed seven hours later... with a perfectly formed stump where his foot used to be.  Huh?The DVD content is brilliant.  Deleted scenes are incorporated for most of the 24 episodes.  There's one commentary track on each of the six discs, usually pairing the featured cast member for that episode with a producer, writer or director.  Kiefer Sutherland is mostly quiet for his commentary, although he raises a great point about how Jack Bauer regularly runs into ordinary citizens and inspires them into acts of great heroism.  Dennis Haysbert talks a lot about his inspirations for President Palmer (Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Colin Powell), and Penny Johnson talks about her inspiration for making Mrs. Palmer sympathetic (Condeleezza Rice, although one suspects Penny's opinion may have changed after this track was recorded in early 2003).  On the bonus disc, the deleted scenes are shown in order with commentary from three members of the production team.  A discarded concept for the season's final shot reveals a shockingly different Big Bad.  A 90-minute documentary detailing the filming of the season's final two episodes contains a lot of goodies, including an April Fool's Day take on how the season is going to end.The current season of ""24"" may be recycling several tricks from earlier seasons of the show, but back in Season 2, most of this material was fresh, and made for months of edge-of-your-seat viewing.",4,"""We will have made a mistake of historic proportions""",1139184000,"02 6, 2006",2006,3733,"[""'ll"", 'always', 'have', 'special', 'affection', 'second', 'season', '24', 'was', 'first', 'season', 'watched', 'knew', 'general', 'outlines', 'first', 'season', 'events', 'occur', 'real', 'time', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'bad', 'accent', 'Pedro', 'Cerrano', 'Major', 'League', 'Presidential', 'candidate', 'Jack', 'wife', 'died', 'last', 'scene', 'etc', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'single', 'frame', 'years', 'later', 'Season', '2', 'when', 'actually', 'started', 'watching.Season', '2', 'graver', 'threat', 'Season', '1', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'set', 'go', 'off', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'whole', 'Presidential', 'administration', 'run', 'not', 'just', 'campaign', 'Jack', 'more', 'stake', 'time', 'not', 'only', 'daughter', 'Kim', 'still', 'getting', 'danger', 'hour', 'also', 'put', 'own', 'life', 'back', 'track', 'season', '1', 'are', 'several', 'villains', 'who', 'appear', 'sequentially', 'Nina', 'Myers', 'making', 'vicious', 'return', 'froggy-throated', 'girl', 'Nickelodeon', 'Fifteen', 'showing', 'up', 'sleeper-cell', 'terrorist', 'maniac', 'Jack', 'Lost', ""n't"", 'get', 'act', 'TV', 'dad', 'John', 'Terry', 'does.The', 'focus', 'season', 'shifts', 'last', 'two', 'discs', 'bomb', 'blast', 'threatened', 'reprisal', 'three', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'countries', 'What', 'fascinating', 'here', 'idealist', 'President', 'rush', 'war', 'been', 'supplied', 'faulty', 'intelligence', 'played', 'out', 'prime', 'time', 'early', '2003', 'war', 'Iraq', 'was', 'beginning', 'basis', 'intelligence', 'also', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'doctored.If', 'weak', 'spot', 'year', '24', 'may', 'be', 'Kim', 'Bauer', 'Season', '1', 'threat', 'Jack', 'extended', 'family', 'Kim', 'weekly', 'perils', 'usually', 'tied', 'back', 'main', 'plot', 'Season', '3', 'more', 'mature', 'Kim', 'worked', 'CTU', 'dated', 'Jack', 'sidekick', 'so', 'again', 'never', 'far', 'main', 'plot', 'Season', '2', 'however', 'Kim', 'efforts', 'escape', 'blast', 'radius', 'are', 'thwarted', 'increasingly', 'bizarre', 'obstacles', 'producers', 'throw', 'way', 'over-the-top', 'boss', 'who', 'not', 'just', 'murderer', 'pervert', 'too', 'creepy', 'poacher', 'living', 'alone', 'woods', 'inexperienced', 'gunman', 'holding', 'up', 'convenience', 'store', 'cougar', 'Even', 'Kim', 'boyfriend', 'season', 'act', 'surviving', 'car', 'wreck', 'apart', 'bloody', 'nose', 'not', 'shown', 'have', 'injuries', 'hospital', 'bed', 'seven', 'hours', 'later', 'perfectly', 'formed', 'stump', 'where', 'foot', 'used', 'be', 'Huh', 'DVD', 'content', 'brilliant', 'Deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'incorporated', 'most', '24', 'episodes', 'one', 'commentary', 'track', 'six', 'discs', 'usually', 'pairing', 'featured', 'cast', 'member', 'episode', 'producer', 'writer', 'director', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'mostly', 'quiet', 'commentary', 'great', 'point', 'how', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'regularly', 'ordinary', 'citizens', 'acts', 'great', 'heroism', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'lot', 'inspirations', 'President', 'Palmer', 'Jimmy', 'Carter', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'Colin', 'Powell', 'Penny', 'Johnson', 'talks', 'inspiration', 'making', 'Mrs.', 'Palmer', 'sympathetic', 'Condeleezza', 'Rice', 'one', 'Penny', 'opinion', 'may', 'have', 'changed', 'track', 'was', 'recorded', 'early', '2003', 'bonus', 'disc', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'shown', 'order', 'commentary', 'three', 'members', 'production', 'team', 'discarded', 'concept', 'season', 'final', 'shot', 'shockingly', 'different', 'Big', 'Bad', '90-minute', 'documentary', 'detailing', 'filming', 'season', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'lot', 'goodies', 'including', 'April', 'Fool', 'Day', 'take', 'how', 'season', 'going', 'end.The', 'current', 'season', '24', 'may', 'be', 'recycling', 'several', 'tricks', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'show', 'back', 'Season', '2', 'most', 'material', 'was', 'fresh', 'made', 'months', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'viewing']",24: Season 2

749702,A3AFNUPOSK2QGV,B00008YGRU,"Joe Kenney ""buttergun""","[5, 6]","Season One of 24 was near-perfect television: movie-quality, with great characters, great cinematography, inventive action, clever plot twists, heart-rending drama, and satisfying conclusions.Season Two is even better.The story picks up a little over a year after the events of Season One.  Main character Jack Bauer, who was already a loose cannon in Season One, is now even more unhinged.  He's just as crazily determined as Mel Gibson's character Riggs in ""Lethal Weapon.""  Just as deadly too.  This makes him the perfect candidate for the mission at hand: find a nuclear bomb, somewhere in the LA area, that is going to go off sometime in the next 24 hours.  Bauer shows no mercy in his quest.I understand that some viewers, many of whom enjoyed Season One, refused to watch Season Two just because they didn't buy it that the same character could go through yet another crazy day.  I find this ridiculous.  That everything happens within a 24-hour period is the show's premise.  Not watching it because you think it's impossible is like not watching ""Star Trek"" because you don't believe in alien life, or not watching ""Buffy"" because you don't believe in vampires.  You have to buy into this show, for sure, but once you do, you find yourself swept along with it.Season One pushed the envelope of what can be shown on television, but Season Two tears the envelope to shreds.  I'm mostly a jaded viewer, but still I was shocked by the amount of carnage and violence on display.  I lost count of how many terrorists Bauer killed, and how many people were tortured.  So be aware that this show doesn't skimp on the violence quotient, which is fine for action junkies such as myself.The budget must have been significant for this season, as the quality of the production is high throughout.  No expenses seem to have been spared.  Let me just give you an idea.  There is a scene where a terrorist is tearing down a runway in a plane that's holding the nuclear bomb.  Bauer and his agents are in hot pursuit, in humvees.  All of this is shown as it actually happens - the plane going super fast, the humvees right behind.  Bauer gets on the roof of the humvee and shoots at the plane.  All of this is shown in the same angle, so you can see that they are actually doing the stunt, that it's not camera trickery.  Now, normally that would be something you'd see at the end of a big-budget film - but this was just the middle half of episode 13!That's just one of the many great action scenes at hand.  Episode 9 features a well-done combat sequence, in which Jack takes on a team of rogue US commandos.  There's more machine gun and small arms fire in this one scene than in most big-budget feature films.  There's another great night-time alley battle in Episode 20 or thereabouts, in which Bauer and two comrades are holed up in an abandoned building, while a squad of heavily armed terrorists track them down.The show isn't just all action.  There's lots of drama on hand, as well.  Normally I shy from the stuff, I find too much of it comes off a bit Lifetime channel-ish.  But the drama reached here is better handled than just about any other movie I can think of.  The heights reached go way beyond the normal strands of television.  Jack's yearning for reconciliation with his daughter, the President's resolve to stand firm, the reunion of Jack and Nina Myers, George Mason saying goodbye to his son, Jack saying goodbye to his daughter from an airplane, and the resolutions to all of these plot threads in the final episode; every one of these scenes, and more, are carried off effectively.I considered Season One to be like a well-done feature film, stretched out over 24 episodes.  Season Two is the same, but it could just as easily be compared to a novel.  There's foreshadowing, set-ups, and resolutions, which each episode working as a chapter.  Things mentioned in early episodes sometimes don't come into play until near the end of the series.  That's one of my favorite things about the show.  It never once insults the viewer's intelligence.  It requires he or she to keep up with events, to remember things.  Nothing is spoon-fed.Season One was originally only greenlit for 12 episodes, but was expanded by Fox to 24 episodes mid-season, requiring the producers to sometimes grasp at straws to continue stretching the tension.  However, Season Two was greenlit for 24 episodes from the get-go, meaning that there is no mid-season slump, this time around, and that the story evolves and expands naturally.So, is everything perfect?  Well, not exactly.  Most reviewers will bring up the oft-ridiculed Kim Bauer plotline, in which Jack's nubile daughter runs from one bizarre encounter to the next, each more unbelievable than the last.  Season One's mid-season downfall occurred when Jack's wife suffered from amnesia, a plot development that just about everyone hated, but in no way does Season Two slump so bad.  I didn't mind the Kim plotline, because I enjoyed the dark comedy of it all.  I mean, the girl goes from being chased by a maniacal guy who's gone buck wild for no reason at all, to being chased by cops, to meeting a deranged loner who lives in a bomb shelter, to getting involved in a hostage situation.Now, most of the scenes with Kim involve her running around.  She wears tight clothing throughout.  The actress portraying Kim is a very shapely, beautiful young woman.  24 is a Fox Television program.  Girl in tight clothes, running around.  Fox program.  NOW do you see why the Kim plotline was added?The DVD release is flawless.  Unlike Season One, there are actually chapter stops!  This alone is cause for celebration.  There are 6 audio commentaries spread throughout the season, and deleted/alternate scenes for most episodes.  You have the option of integrating these scenes back into the episodes by selecting that feature on each episode's menu, or you can watch all of them, separated from the shows they're from, on the bonus 7th disc of the set.  This is a nice feature, as I prefer watching the episodes without interruption, and then watching what was taken out later.  The video and audio presentation is flawless.In short, 24 is a fast-paced, action-packed, emotion-pulling tour de force; an intelligent, mature, supremely-crafted piece of entertainment that surpasses any other action TV program I've ever seen.  The final episode is just as satisfying as the conclusions of ""Die Hard,"" ""Lethal Weapon,"" ""The Rock,"" or any other action movie you could name.  If you are a discerning viewer who believes there's nothing on TV worth watching, get ready to have all of your notions blown away.The only way I can sum it all up is this: for years now, I've been a TV snob.  Never watched ""Friends,"" never watched ""Law & Order,"" never watched ""CSI.""  As far as I was concerned, the only show worth watching was ""the Simpsons.""  I still think it's the best show in TV history, but that's a story/review/debate for another time.  So when I say that I think Season Two of 24 is certainly equal to - and in a few ways better than - the Simpsons, please understand that this is the highest praise I can give.",5,24 more hours of pure

749703,AQBRMBQ99ESI7,B00008YGRU,"John A Lee III ""jal3""","[4, 9]","Season two has just as much excitement and suspense as season one. Terrorists want to blow up a nuke in LA. The president turns to Jack Bauer to solve the problem. The president is helped by his own integrity but faces real problems of backbiting within his administration. CTU has the same problem. The president is great. I wish we really had leaders like this.Episode Synopses appear below:8 AM - 9 AM - Jack Bauer has left the CTU after the death of his wife. He's having a hard time coping. Things are not made any better by his estrangement from his daughter. Senator Palmer from the last season is now President Palmer. When word comes that an Arab terrorist cell has a nuclear device set to go off in Los Angeles TODAY, the president insists that Bauer be brought in on the case. He is reluctant but does so on the condition that his daughter is taken to safety outside the city. President Palmer still seems to be the honest and upstanding guy he was in the last season. He lays down the law to the suspect government without equivocation but also refuses to jump to any conclusions. Jack, on the other hand, is even grittier than before. He will do what it takes to save the city even if it means executing a child molester. The daughter, Kim, continues to further demonstrate her propensity to hook up with losers. She works as a nanny for a little girl. The husband obviously has the hots for her but is a wife beater, daughter beater and nanny beater. It's going to be another long day.9 AM - 10 AM - Kim and the girl she watches over manages to make an escape but the psychopath is after them. There is no indication that he is involved with the terrorists at this point but he's enough to ruin anyone's day. Jack makes contact with the first level of bad guys by cashing in on an old acquaintance who thinks he's another crook. They are suspicious but Jack manages to convince them in a rather unorthodox way that violates lots of civil rights. They are still suspicious. CTU has problems as well. One of the functionaries is frightened enough that she has a hard time doing her job. Worse is the guy who runs the unit. He is frightened and making a beeline to get out of the potential blast radius. That leaves CTU without an effective head. The President has his own problems. He doesn't want to panic the nation but a reporter is suspicious and about to blow up the whole thing on TV. Convincing the reporter to keep the story under wraps is not easy so he gets some civil rights violated as well. There is also a bride with problems. She is about to get married to a guy who might be one of the Middle East terrorists. The supposition is that he is using her as a cover. The bride's sister is suspicious and trying to check up on him but has no real reason to connect him to any plot.10 AM - 11 AM - The psychotic father has reported Kim Bauer as a kidnapper. Kim is still trying to get herself and the girl away from him. She finally calls her father for help but it is a bad time. He is in the car with some terrorists on their way to blow up CTU. Since he is acting weird, she freaks out and calls CTU for help; she takes a bus for CTU. Jack can't get in touch to warn CTU that they are a target because the terrorists have interrupted the phone line. So Jack calls the president to try and get a message through to evacuate the place. Since the president is in the middle of a press conference, a staffer takes the call. She wants to let the president know immediately but another staffer with his own agenda has other plans. He calls CTU to get them to pass all their data along to them. This takes them off of jobs that they need to be doing. As Mason, the cowardly director, tries to flee the blast area, he gets a call to check out a lead. He does divert to check it out and finds part of the trail but is ambushed. These terrorists seem to be of the domestic variety instead of the Arab one. The sister of the bride learns that her suspicions are well founded but is told not to tell anyone else for fear of her endangering her family and herself. She is a poor actress (in this context) and everyone wonders why she is acting so strangely.11 AM - 12 PM - The terrorist bomb got the CTU. Many are dead and others are dying. Kim was walking in right as they started to evacuate. She is alive but the little girl she is caring for starts having seizures because of the beatings from her father. Kim is now a suspect in those beatings. Jack gets the location of the next contact up the line but while doing so has to eliminate those he is with. The guys who blew up the CTU are a bunch of home grown nuts. They know nothing about the nuke and have been duped. Jack finds the guy but he is holed up in his own personal bomb shelter. When he finally believes the plot is real, he takes drastic action but not before he gives Jack one more clue that leads in an unexpected direction. Mason the cowardly leader of the Los Angeles CTU finally shows some guts. Since he has been exposed to a lethal dose of radiation, he has nothing to lose and heads back to take charge and make difficult choices. The president is having trouble with those closest to him. One of his advisors is trying to keep the president in the dark and the other wants to tell him. The one who wants to block it has political and personal power motives. When the president finds out he's been kept in the dark, he is rightfully hacked.  The bridegroom continues to act suspiciously and his soon to be sister in law gets more and more paranoid. The private investigator she hired has set off some red flags and he is taken into custody by the feds.12 PM - 1 PM - The child beating father manages to intimidate both Kim and the mother to keep them from saying anything bad about him. Kim finally manages to get in touch with her father who tells her what is going on. He swears her to secrecy and makes her promise to leave town. She agrees and then promptly gets others involved in an effort to rescue the little girl from the hospital.  The lead provided by Jack's previous suspect leads right to Nina, the mole from last season who killed his wife. She has information but will not say anything until she gets a presidential pardon. The president is inclined to capitulate because the options are worse. Jack learns about this and strong-arms Mason into letting him handle the interrogation. The president is also leaning on the country suspected of funding the terrorists. Against the advice of all, he agrees to an intelligence exchange. As the ambassador is leaving, though, his chopper crashes and he is killed. Meanwhile, CTU is onto the bridegroom and sends someone out to interrogate him. Naturally, the bride freaks out.1 PM - 2 PM - Jack is interrogating Nina to find out more about the plot. His strategy is to convince her that he will kill her and does not care about the consequences. It's effective but gets only limited results. Jack has to take her to meet the next person up the chain. The president is trying to keep the lid on things but having a staff that is infighting among itself proves frustrating. It is even worse when the ex-wife from hell shows up sowing more distrust (which is probably deserved) and making another power grab for herself. The plot to free the child from the hospital gets complicated. Kim is much less adept at these matters than her father but she does show some promise. The interrogation of the bridegroom seems stalled until his parents show up. Then he finally gives up the goods on someone completely unexpected. He may or may not be telling the truth but the CTU agent buys his story.2 PM - 3 PM - Jack sets Nina up to meet her contact. Nobody trusts her. She leads them to her contact but slips her leash for a brief period. The contact is wounded. The president's administration is riven by suspicion. The ex wife is just making things worse. Its to run an investigation when you think that anybody is just waiting to stab you in the back. Mason's symptoms are getting worse. He brings in his son to effect reconciliation before he dies. Kim and her boyfriend are making their escape with the little girl and everything seems to be going in their favor when they get stopped for a traffic violation. The cop is gong to let them go when he notices something dripping from the trunk. It's not ketchup.3 PM - 4 PM - Kim and her boyfriend are arrested for murder. They and the little girl are taken back towards LA. She finally gets the sheriff to get in touch with CTU and Jack. He is on his way back with Nina and one of the terrorists and is distracted by his daughter's pleas for help. He gets further distracted when Nina gets the location of the bomb and kills the terrorist. She is now in a strong bargaining position. The president's wife is worming her way deeper and deeper into intrigue. She convinces the president to let her talk to the reporter being held. The original terrorists finally put in another appearance. They are trying to get their bomb to the right site. They are having a bad day as well. Car trouble and a terrorist who is having second thoughts mess up their original plans. The sister who hired the PI to investigate the Arab groom is worried since her dad is taken into custody. She gets the PI to hack into his files in order to clear him. Instead, things get more suspicious. There is a possible explanation; Dad claims to be an agent as well. It becomes moot when unknown parties abduct the sister and the PI. All the attempts at secrecy start to fall apart when the reporter somehow gets free and goes live with a panic story. About this time, the plane with Jack and Nina starts to fall out of the air.4 PM - 5 PM - Recordings show that the president's ex wife was not the one who let the reporter go. It was a fired staffer. This seemingly clears the wife but don't be too sure about that. The plane with Jack and Nina has crashed. They are both alive and search and rescue is on the way. Some well armed soldiers show up first and they are trouble. The only thing that might save Jack and Nina is his Special Forces background. This gives Nina a chance to get the drop on Jack and make more demands. She wants a pardon for the murder of Jack in return for information on the location of the bomb. The sister and her PI have been abducted by the head honcho terrorist. They want to know what they found in her father's files and torture IS an option. The only thing that might be in her favor is that the address given up by Nina might be the one where she is being held. The father of the bride is looking more and more guilty and the Arab groom is looking more and more innocent. That makes the bride believe that her fianc&eacute; has turned on her dad. It is a no win situation for grooms. At least the beaten little girl seems to be getting to safety. The same cannot be said of Kim and her boyfriend.5 PM - 6 PM - The distrust in the president's cabinet is raised even higher when Jack reports that he was attacked by US troops from a unit run by the NSA. The president is inclined to arrest the director but his ex wife persuades him to wait until he has more proof. She is making herself more and more valuable but the snake is not to be trusted. Kim and her boyfriend are being transported to the LA jail but manage to stage an attempt to get away. She does but others are not so lucky. Jack takes down the address given to him by Nina with a rescue squad. He manages to rescue the sister of the bride but the bad guy swallows a cyanide capsule and that source of information is lost. The big bad guy is still at large. Things start coming together but they are confusing. The bride has a big surprise for everyone, especially the groom.6 PM - 7 PM - The blushing bride is up to her eyeballs in the nuclear plot. Presumably her father is as well. There is also some suspicion about the sister but Jack thinks she is clean. The ex wife of the president is up to her eyeballs in the plot against the president's administration. She gets the head of the NSA, one of her cohorts, arrested. The president knows something is fishy. He authorizes some unsavory and extra legal methods to get information. An assault on a mosque known to have the head terrorist winds up without the quarry. Meanwhile, the bad sister (bride) manages to get the nuclear triggers. Kim doesn't get very far in her bid to get away. She finds a large cat who considers her to be a tasty and nutritious way to end the day.7 PM - 8 PM - The terrorist does not get away, as seemed would happen and Jack uses the same interrogation philosophy used by the president but his methods are even uglier. The bride's sister finds out that the bride has been implicated in the murder of the groom and the terrorist plot. She doesn't want to believe it but agrees to set up a cell phone trace. Dad doesn't want to believe it either but fills in some information about her past. Just when things don't seem to be able to get any uglier, Jack gets the information he needs. The bomb is at an airport. Evidence begins to mount that the rat in his office is his ex wife. That further ratchets up the tension.  A rescuer finds Kim and likes what he sees.8 PM - 9 PM - The corrupt head of the NSA finally breaks under interrogation and confirms the location of the bomb. He also reveals the existence of a rogue US paramilitary force that will kill anyone who gets in the way of their getting the bomb. Jack finds them but they are dead. They have been executed by somebody. Kim's rescuer turns out to be a nut in his own right. He's a survivalist and has is own personal bomb shelter with quite an arms cache. He's been looking forward to a bomb burst for some time. Getting Kim into his bomb shelter raises expectations. Bureaucrats from CTU are worried about the bombed out base of operations and want to move things up to their office. George Mason, the irradiated head of the local office, steps forward and won't let them do it. They have too many operations in play at the moment. The higher ups have heard that he is no longer able to run things but he puts on a good face. He is failing fast, though.  The NSA director, while being confronted lets slip that there is one more commando unaccounted for but fails to let them know that the ex wife is part of the plot. Jack and his team manage to stop the plane with the bomb but it is a decoy. The bomb is still in play. When the NSA director learns about this, he does point the finger.9 PM - 10 PM - CTU has the pilot of the plane but he claims that he was doing it for his family. They were to be paid when he blew himself up. He claims not to know about the bomb being a dummy or about the location of the real one. The sister of the bride has proven most helpful thus far but she is nave. When she sees her sister, she runs to find her and try to get things ""straightened out"". She does not count on her sister being willing to kill her to get her badge. Luckily, Jack is not nave. The president confronts his ex wife and, reluctantly, she admits that she has been plotting but she claims not to know about how the plans have unraveled. She might even be telling the truth but her track record is against her. Kim's rescuer gets more and more exited. He is looking forward to repopulating the world which doesn't need populating. His lies begin to unravel and she gets suspicious. George Mason comes to the point where he knows he can't do the job any more because of the radiation sickness. He bows out and turns things over to Tony and is a real class act. The episode ends with them finding the bomb. At least that is what we are supposed to believe. With this series, though, all we can be sure of is that everyone is probably wrong.10 PM - 11 PM - The bomb has a little less than an hour before it goes off. Jack decides to fly it as far from LA as possible. There are two options. One is to head out to sea and the other is to head for the desert. Each has drawbacks. The desert is chosen. It is a suicide run. Jack is planning on flying it himself but he has a stowaway. Because of that, he may survive after all. CTU has a diplomatic problem. They are cracking information on a terrorist hard drive which implicate three foreign governments. Many people are urging the president to prepare for war but there is the possibility that the allegations are false. Only time will tell and time is running out. Time does run out on the bomb with the inevitable consequences.11 PM - 12 AM - The bomb has gone off and Jack is alive. The big problem at present is that there is some belief that three foreign governments were part of the plot. Strangely enough, there is reason to believe him but there is much evidence to contradict him. There is the distinct possibility that the governments are being framed. CTU assessment gets garbled when it gets passed to the president and it looks like the US is going to war. Jack is asked to further interrogate the prime suspect to determine if he is lying and he agrees to do so but he is distracted by concern for his daughter. He gets an answer but the terrorist is assassinated moments later. Could this be the last member of the rogue US team? Whoever it is, he is offering Jack evidence that the recordings implicating the foreign governments are is faked. The price is breaking the bride's sister out of CTU. Kim thinks her dad is dead and she is trying to figure out what to do. She goes into a closed store to use the bathroom and the craziness is just beginning. People are trying to rob the store and the chaos factor grows.12 AM - 1 AM - Jack breaks Kate out of CTU in order to try and find out about the possibility of the evidence against the unnamed middle eastern countries being fabricated. This makes Jack a suspicious character in CTU's eyes.  The cabinet is pushing for war but the president will not back down from his insistence that they must get this right. This makes others think he is losing his nerve and the plotting begins to thicken. Jack finds the missing 7th member of the strike team. He wants Kate as a hostage to ensure his getaway. He says he has evidence that a business cartel arranged the plot. Jack sees no choice but to make the transfer. All seems to go well then all are ambushed by parties unknown. The situation at the convenience store has gotten out of hand. A man has been killed and Kim is being held hostage until the police take the wife of the killer a safe distance from the city.1 AM - 2 AM - Getting out of the ambush set of for Jack and his source takes a lot of effort. He requires the help from inside CTU but his source is under suspicion. They manage to get away but the head guy is shot in the escape. Only he can tell where the information is and he refuses to go to a hospital. Eventually he realizes he is dying and starts to tell Jack where the information is hidden but he waits too long. Kim still thinks her dad is dead and has been taken into custody by the LA county sheriff's office. Now with events the way they are, the authorities are inclined to believe her earlier story but she is still in trouble for some of the escape attempt. The president is dealing with problems as well. His cabinet is being less than fully supportive and is second guessing him. The military is unsatisfied with the way things are being done and rioting is beginning to break out in the east. Shootings by the National Guard only make matters worse.2 AM - 3 AM - Jack finds a tracking device in the chip with the evidence. He sends the evidence with Kate and the foreign agent to get back to CTU. He takes the tracker himself to decoy the hostiles in a different direction. His distraction works but he gets caught. That sets up another torture scenario with Jack on the receiving end. The hidden powers want the evidence suppressed and a great deal of money rides on it. Things at CTU are starting to fall apart. Personal agendas and family relations are tearing working relationships apart.  The president's cabinet has been summoned to a secret meeting. It looks like the Vice President is staging a coup.3 AM - 4 AM - The torture keeps getting worse for Bauer and he still refuses to give up the information the terrorists want. He does manage to get free and get a name for the higher ups. Kate and the foreign intelligence officer are about to head to CTU when they get caught by some hysterical people looking to kill Arabs. The guy gets a beating and robbed and the thugs get the chip. Kate offers them money if she can get the chip back and they take her to her house for the payoff. The president's loyal advisor is critically injured as she tries to escape the custody one of those holding her. The president is suspicious but unaware that his NSA director is at the heart of the plot. The vice president is as bad as the ex wife about being a power hungry @$$4 AM - 5 AM - Jack gets the chip and tries to transmit the data but the chip is damaged. He tries to get some CTU types to clean up the data but there is a power grab in process by some types working with the vice president. The president also has problems. He is on trial by his cabinet. The VP is going for broke and has perjured testimony ready. The vote is ugly. The results are uglier. The one slim hope is to find the guy who actually did the forgery work. Jack heads that way. What he finds is the ugliest thing yet.5 AM - 6 AM - The president is relieved and the VP takes over. Planes are on the way and the beginning of the war is imminent. Power struggles within the cabinet leave enough uncertainty for the president to get a Secret Service agent working on his side. Power struggles within CTU also hang things up. Jack's only source of help is relieved of duty. Jack has found not only the guy who doctored the tapes but the BIGGEST TRAITOR OF ALL. The traitor is still trying to wheel and deal and the geek is worried about the future. He doesn't want to go to jail and is frightened. He doesn't know whether to trust Jack or the traitor. He gives the traitor a knife and Jack the slip. Kim Bauer finally makes another significant part of the story line. She is laboring under the delusion that everything will now be fine and the bits and pieces are being mopped up. A deputy takes her to her former employer's house to pick up her things. The wife beater is hiding out there. Kim learns that sometimes life is nasty and survival is nastier.6 AM - 7 AM - Jack catches up with the fleeing computer geek but not before he manages to critically hurt himself. CTU sends a chopper to pick him up but the political types call it off before the pickup can be made. This has severe health consequences for the geek. That means that Jack has to rely on the traitor. He wants the rat to set up a meet with the big guys to try and get evidence. Jacks biggest problem besides being stuck with a traitor, and needing to stop a war is that he has been damaged by the torture. That lowers his effectiveness and he has to trust the least trustworthy person in the entire series.  The VP's government needs a deal too. Some of the bombers have been spotted and the Turks want to talk to Palmer personally. The VP needs him to pretend like he is still the president. That is the only way to save the American aircrews. After showing a bit of spunk, Kim is now in shock over shooting the guy that wanted to kill her. Jack sends Kate to pick her up but Kim doesn't know or trust Kate.7 AM - 8 AM - The president's lawyer finds some corroborating evidence. This makes the president's chief of staff have second thoughts. He orders CTU to help Bauer. That gets Bauer's associates off the hook but  Bauer is struggling to get to the meet and he thinks he is unsupported. When he finally makes contact, time is running out. He has to trust the arch traitor to wear a wire. Kim and Kate make it to CTU. Jack the traitor goes through with the meet live and on the air. They get the evidence but who knows whether the VP wants to accept it. That's a political problem. Jack's problem is that the stress causes problems with his heart. All of the goals seem to be met but things are set up for further trouble.

749705,AO9J9F3O1BT7B,B00008YGRU,John,"[46, 55]","I was always skeptical about 24 going into a second season. It ended near perfectly at the end of the first season. Buy when I checked out season two, I was hooked all over again. Not only is the season more interesting, it involves issues that our world is currently dealing with. Not only that, but the action has been pumped up 400%, that acting keeps getting better, and Jack (Keifer Sutherland) is one of the best characters to follow on TV.With the finale just around the corner, and a new third season on the way, I think it is safe to say this DVD is a perfect buy for any fan of the show, or anybody who missed its initial run and wants to see what all the hype is about. Surely it will have many more special features than season 1 did, since the first season DVD was produced and created in about 2 months. Most likely as well as the stuff season one's had, like preview for season three, and quite possibly an alernate ending. Hopefully they will put in some commentaries in the mix as well.But anyway.....Fox is doing a great job with their TV on DVD lately.

749707,A3OH101U0CPUC7,B00008YGRU,Joseph Boone,"[7, 9]","Season 2 follows Jack Bauer as he tries to stop a nuclear bomb from exploding in the city of Los Angeles in addition to preventing a war of retaliation springing from that same event. Most of the cast from the first season is back including the now-President David Palmer and his ex-wife Sherry. Jack's daughter Kim and the crew from CTU including villain Nina Meyers all are present and accounted for. I won't reveal much of the story specifics because too much of the enjoyment of 24 revolves around the unexpected twists and turns of the plot. Suffice it to say, that the viewer is kept guessing about much of what is going on and Jack is put through a very bad day indeed.As with24 - Season One, there are some real highs and lows here. Jack himself is great and the show is at its best when we watch him do what he does best. President Palmer, played by Dennis Haysbert, has great presence and is always compelling to watch. The struggle to find the nuke and stop it from killing millions of people is riveting and provided for some very exciting moments. Unfortunately, that story is resolved in episode 16 along with virtually every other plot thread and then the show tries to start a whole new series of stories revolving around a war to retaliate against three countries that may have been involved in the plot to nuke LA. The season really loses steam at this point and almost every aspect feels extremely contrived and unrealistic. Instead of building to a great climax, it wheezes across the finish line like an out of shape marathon runner. I know it wouldn't have the same marketing pizzazz but they honestly should have named this season ""16"" and finished after 16 hours. It would have made for a far stronger product.The worst aspect of Season 2 is undoubtedly Kim Bauer and her increasingly unlikely story where she meets and is threatened by what appears to be every psychotic in the greater LA area and even a mountain lion thrown is for good measure. There is no connection whatsoever to the main story, she's just there for Jack to worry about and, apparently, to annoy viewers. One plot that was somewhat interesting was civil unrest and rioting related to the bomb but after several scenes building tension on this point it simply fades away unresolved and forgotten. Other flaws include CTU headquarters apparently having no restrictions to family and friends walking around at will, a phony urgency to retaliate with hours of the nuke or never, and more.The funny thing about 24 is that you can point out endless flaws that are silly and easily avoidable yet the show's twists and turns largely carry you through them on sheer momentum. Kiefer Sutherland is fantastic in the lead role and also helps viewers ignore most of the worst flaws. Still, there's no question the show would be far less frustrating and more enjoyable if the writers would dig a little deeper and make a more honest effort to provide less contrived situations and an understanding of national security that surpasses that of the average 12 year old. I do recommend this season of 24, but only to those who are willing to accept some frustration with their entertainment.",3,Should have ended at hour 16,1196553600,"12 2, 2007",2007,3169,"['Season', '2', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'stop', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'exploding', 'city', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'addition', 'preventing', 'war', 'retaliation', 'springing', 'same', 'event', 'Most', 'cast', 'first', 'season', 'back', 'including', 'now-President', 'David', 'Palmer', 'ex-wife', 'Sherry', 'Jack', 'daughter', 'Kim', 'crew', 'CTU', 'including', 'villain', 'Nina', 'Meyers', 'are', 'present', 'accounted', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'much', 'story', 'specifics', 'too', 'much', 'enjoyment', '24', 'revolves', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'Suffice', 'say', 'viewer', 'kept', 'guessing', 'about', 'much', 'what', 'going', 'Jack', 'put', 'very', 'bad', 'day', 'indeed.As', 'with24', 'Season', 'One', 'are', 'real', 'highs', 'lows', 'here', 'Jack', 'great', 'show', 'best', 'when', 'watch', 'do', 'what', 'best', 'President', 'Palmer', 'played', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'great', 'presence', 'always', 'compelling', 'watch', 'struggle', 'find', 'nuke', 'stop', 'killing', 'millions', 'people', 'riveting', 'provided', 'very', 'exciting', 'moments', 'Unfortunately', 'story', 'resolved', 'episode', '16', 'virtually', 'other', 'plot', 'thread', 'then', 'show', 'start', 'whole', 'new', 'series', 'stories', 'revolving', 'war', 'retaliate', 'three', 'countries', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'involved', 'plot', 'nuke', 'LA', 'season', 'really', 'steam', 'point', 'almost', 'aspect', 'extremely', 'contrived', 'unrealistic', 'Instead', 'building', 'great', 'climax', 'finish', 'line', 'out', 'shape', 'marathon', 'runner', 'know', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'marketing', 'pizzazz', 'honestly', 'should', 'have', 'named', 'season', '16', 'finished', '16', 'hours', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'far', 'stronger', 'product.The', 'worst', 'aspect', 'Season', '2', 'undoubtedly', 'Kim', 'Bauer', 'increasingly', 'unlikely', 'story', 'where', 'meets', 'threatened', 'what', 'be', 'psychotic', 'greater', 'LA', 'area', 'even', 'mountain', 'lion', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'connection', 'whatsoever', 'main', 'story', 'just', 'there', 'Jack', 'worry', 'about', 'apparently', 'annoy', 'viewers', 'One', 'plot', 'was', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'was', 'civil', 'unrest', 'rioting', 'related', 'bomb', 'several', 'scenes', 'building', 'tension', 'point', 'simply', 'away', 'unresolved', 'forgotten', 'Other', 'flaws', 'include', 'CTU', 'headquarters', 'apparently', 'having', 'restrictions', 'family', 'friends', 'walking', 'around', 'will', 'phony', 'urgency', 'retaliate', 'hours', 'nuke', 'never', 'more.The', 'funny', 'thing', '24', 'can', 'point', 'out', 'endless', 'flaws', 'are', 'silly', 'easily', 'avoidable', 'yet', 'show', 'twists', 'largely', 'carry', 'sheer', 'momentum', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'fantastic', 'lead', 'role', 'also', 'viewers', 'ignore', 'most', 'worst', 'flaws', 'Still', 'question', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'far', 'less', 'frustrating', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'writers', 'would', 'dig', 'little', 'deeper', 'make', 'more', 'honest', 'effort', 'provide', 'less', 'contrived', 'situations', 'understanding', 'national', 'security', 'average', '12', 'year', 'old', 'do', 'recommend', 'season', '24', 'only', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'accept', 'frustration', 'entertainment']",24: Season 2

If you thought the worst part of Jack Bauer's life was over, then, you don't know Jack!Picking up approximately 2 years after the events of ""24: Season One"", Jack's life is in shambles.  Jack, (played brilliantly by Keifer Sutherland) no longer works at CTU, his daughter Kim (Elisha Cuthbert) has all but severed ties with him because of the constant reminder of her dead mother, and now the security of the United States is threatened yet again.  Now terrorists have threatened to detonate a nuclear device in the middle of L.A., now faced with a possible panic current President David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) must ask Jack Bauer to come out of retirement, and infiltrate the terrorist cell behind the threat and stop the bomb from being detonated.After an incredible, action packed first season, many felt the Fox network really had their work cut out for them in returning for a second season of ""24"".  Using the same real-time format, virtually the same cast and having more bad stuff happen in the so called, ""City of Angels"", and calling upon the same man to save the day.  It seemed as if Fox was maybe expecting too much from television audiences; however, any critics were quickly silenced when the clock began ticking on Day 2 of this gripping drama, as week after week audiences across America tuned in to see just how Jack Bauer and Co. were going to save the day.  The redeeming fact to what makes this show believable, aside from the real-time format and realistic characters, is the fact that in season 2, or Day 2, the process to solving this threat is conducted with more teamwork.

749718,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,B00008YGRU,Kenji Fujishima,"[3, 3]","The first season of ""24"" introduced to television the idea of an action thriller told in real-time: 24 hours, 24 episodes, one hour per episode. The concept was generally well executed in Season 1, but the second half of the season admittedly did not seem quite as well-paced or well-planned as the first. With elements like Teri Bauer's instant amnesia and Kim Bauer's return to Rick, it seemed obvious that the writers were straining to sustain the already intricate main terrorist plot for the whole season. And yet, despite its imperfections, the whole added up to more than the sum of its parts. It worked as an addictive television thriller, sure; but not only did it also manage subtle political commentary into its storylines, it also managed real humanity and soul amidst its conventional action-thriller elements. And of course there was the calm center of the show, Kiefer Sutherland, who was able to sustain a deft mixture of soulfulness, charisma, and intensity as Jack Bauer for all 24 episodes.The second season of ""24"" could have gone wrong; it could have exacerbated the problems of Season 1's second half and easily become a mess. And yet, Robert Cochran, Joel Surnow, and co. returned with a sophomore season that is, in many ways, even better than the first. There is a confident sweep that amazingly spans the entire season; you really get the feeling that the writers know where the twisty plot is going every step of the way. And---especially when the season aired, during 2002-3, as the U.S. was launching its still-controversial Iraq offensive---Season 2 is even stronger with the topical relevance, as, in the season's latter half, (possible spoiler alert) President David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) finds his presidency endangered by a decision he makes regarding a surprise attack and the possibility that it may be based on false intelligence. To those who followed President George W. Bush's decision to go to war in Iraq, the parallels must have seemed uncanny in 2003. Season 2 may be the first season of ""24"" to fully assert its calling card: the fear of terrorism that marks the atmosphere these days is used to ground the Hollywood-thriller action---and occasional outrageous plot twists---of ""24"" in today's reality. Season 2 has more torture scenes than Season 1, but the writers suggest that, under this atmosphere of tension and fear, these are the kinds of methods that may have to be employed in order to keep the country safe.As well-done as Season 2 is, not even this season manages perfection. The storylines involving Kim Bauer (played by Elisha Cuthbert) have gotten a lot of flack from fans, and for understandable reasons: she gets into so much trouble that after a while her sheer bad luck starts to feel impossibly contrived---mere padding, if you will. (Thankfully, Kim wasn't around for Season 4.) Yet, at least Cuthbert herself has the good luck to be involved in what is perhaps the best scene of the entire season: an emotional, heartbreaking scene during the 10PM hour in which father Jack tells her he may not be returning from the field alive.Jack Bauer is perhaps worth a mention too; this is a slightly different Jack from the one seen in Season 1. Apparently, since his wife's tragic death 18 months ago, he's gained a ruthless streak that leads him to act nearly as dirty as the terrorists in trying to save Los Angeles from nuclear annihilation. In other words, it seems to me that Jack Bauer has morphed from a straight action hero into a morally ambiguous anti-hero, one who dirties his hands and does controversial things---like stage the death of a suspected terrorist's son---to get results. Perhaps the subtle transformation is meant to be a commentary by itself: this is what terrorism and the threat of war does to characters like Jack. It's a credit to Kiefer Sutherland that he still manages to make Bauer a compelling, even charismatic lead figure without making him too likable.Dennis Haysbert is also on hand as President David Palmer, and once again he is one of authentically presidential actors you'll ever see. Conviction rings through nearly every syllable of Haysbert's voice; but this is hardly a one-note performance. Haysbert manages to create a convincing portrayal of a president under undue pressure, and not only from the country to protect them from terrorism; members of his own cabinet, it turns out, seem to have it in for Palmer in some way.Other characters pop up from Season 1. Sherry Palmer (Penny Johnson Jerald), for instance, who was so unceremoniously dismissed by her husband at the end of the first season, returns; so does Nina Myers (Sarah Clarke), who was revealed to be a traitor in the penultimate episode of Season 1 and killed Teri Bauer in the end. It's apparently a small world in the ""24"" universe, but no matter: ""24"" is a show about intelligent thrills, not about absolute realism.I have yet to see the third season of ""24,"" but if it is as messy and uneven as a lot of fans say it is, then Season 2, for me, will stand as the best season of ""24"" so far. As enjoyable as Seasons 1 & 4 was, neither managed the confident forward sweep of this second season, which is so well-executed that it truly does start to feel like one huge epic action film. I can think of no higher compliment for the second season of this fine show.

As is the case with this series though, there is much more than meets than eye...Kiefer Sutherland, Sarah Clark (who is GORGEOUS!), Dennis Haysbert, Carlos Bernard, Xander Berkeley (!) and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  Very well written and very well presented, the series is without a doubt guaranteed to provide hours of entertainment.The major setbacks are in relation to:1) The attack out of nowhere on Yousouf and Kate Warner at exactly the wrong time.2) It gets worse when Yousouf survives long enough just to tell Jack Kate's address and then dies!!!3) There's also the whole bringing people back from the dead (!!!) in typical soap opera fashion... Shameful!4) And if that wasn't bad enough, then for hours afterwards the ""resurrected"" is as good as new even though he's had holes burned into him, they have cut through him and they have sliced him open.5) The ridiculous capture of Jack when all he had to do is drop the tracker in a waste disposal or slip it in someone's pocket!6) The completely useless daughter that attracts all (literally ALL) weirdos, psychos, and retards.  The actress is very attractive, but the writers have turned her into a complete moron!7) The endless dragging on of her ""ordeal"" and how she screws everything up ALL THE TIME!8) The return of the very annoying Palmer wife and the unlikely path she has chosen.9) The presence of the equally annoying Paula.10) Everything that could (and couldn't or shouldn't) go wrong does go wrong!On the positive side:1) 24 Sheds light on illegal covert operations carried out by cartels and shadow agencies within the government.2) Kiefer Sutherland and Sarah Clark have an amazing chemistry, while Dennis Haysbert and Carlos Bernard were born for their respective roles.3) Good moral story with the president doing the right thing and making the right choices.4) Very original to have the whole series be ""24 hours.""5) A good look into the dirty world of politics.In short, 24 is a series definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!

From a critical point of view, the story in season one may be better, but I enjoyed season two much more because even though the suspense is still great, the story seems less believable (more James-Bondish style).

749738,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B00008YGRU,Mark Baker,"[12, 13]","I enjoyed season one of this inventive show.  When I found out it had been picked up for another season, the only question left in my mind was ""Will they be able to match the first season?""  When this season started, I had my answer.  They surpassed it with flying colors.Season two picks up a year and a half after season one.  Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) is estranged from his daughter Kim (Elisha Cuthbert), who has moved out and is working as a nanny.  Jack has also quite his job at the Los Angeles branch of the Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU).  That doesn't matter to now President David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert).  When the President gets news that there is a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles, he calls Jack to personally ask him to help prevent the disaster.  Reluctantly, Jack agrees to go back to work for CTU to find the bomb before it goes off.  But first, he calls Kim and warns her to get out of LA in case he can't find it in time.  Meanwhile, Kate Warne (Sarah Wynter) is busy getting ready for her sister's wedding.  But something about the groom to be doesn't feel right to her.One idea discussed at the end of season one was going to more self-contained stories.  Fortunately, the producers decided to keep their one day per season real time.  I have seem some argue that the real time format isn't followed as closely this season, but if so, I found no evidence of it.This show builds on the returning characters from season one and even manages to bring back villainesses Sherry Palmer (Penny Johnson Jerald) and Nina Myers (Sarah Clarke) in believable ways.  The story is mostly self-contained, so you could jump in here is you wanted to, but watching season one will help explain all the relationships and increase your enjoyment of the show.  The new characters help build the story of season two, although the Kate sub-plot seems out of place until at least a third of the way through the season when you begin to understand how it fits with everything else.  Kim's sub-plot of trying to leave LA starts out believable, but grows increasingly ludicrous as the day goes by.  The main storyline, however, moves quickly with lots of twists and turns.  Each episode ends with a cliffhanger that will make you want to keep watching.After the success of season one and the DVD release of that season, the producers had more time to plan this DVD set, and it shows.  The twenty-four episodes are preserved on six discs.  Each episode is shown in sharp wide screen and presented in surround sound.  Removing my complaint from season one, the ""Previously on 24"" recap is included, although you can skip over it if you so desire.  Chapter breaks and a play all feature are also included on these discs.  Each disc includes one audio commentary with a member of the cast and crew as well as deleted scenes from the episodes.If that's not enough to make you happy, check out the seventh disc.  It includes all 44 deleted scenes in one place with optional commentary.  In additional, there are two featurettes on the production and post-production of the show.  A third featurette goes into behind the scenes detail on the bombing of CTU from early in the season.Not only did the producers step up the plate with a better over all second season, but the DVD set is better as well.  A few minor sub-plot complaints can't hamper the enjoyment of the thriller that is 24 season two.",5,Jack's Back,1131148800,"11 5, 2005",2005,3386,"['enjoyed', 'season', 'one', 'inventive', 'show', 'When', 'found', 'had', 'been', 'picked', 'up', 'season', 'only', 'question', 'left', 'mind', 'was', 'Will', 'be', 'able', 'match', 'first', 'season', 'When', 'season', 'started', 'had', 'answer', 'surpassed', 'flying', 'colors.Season', 'two', 'up', 'year', 'half', 'season', 'one', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'Kim', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'who', 'moved', 'out', 'working', 'nanny', 'Jack', 'also', 'quite', 'job', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'branch', 'Counter', 'Terrorism', 'Unit', 'CTU', ""n't"", 'matter', 'now', 'President', 'David', 'Palmer', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'When', 'President', 'news', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Jack', 'personally', 'ask', 'help', 'prevent', 'disaster', 'Reluctantly', 'Jack', 'go', 'back', 'work', 'CTU', 'find', 'bomb', 'off', 'first', 'Kim', 'get', 'LA', 'case', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'time', 'Meanwhile', 'Kate', 'Warne', 'Sarah', 'Wynter', 'busy', 'getting', 'ready', 'sister', 'wedding', 'something', 'groom', 'be', ""n't"", 'feel', 'right', 'her.One', 'idea', 'discussed', 'end', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'going', 'more', 'self-contained', 'stories', 'Fortunately', 'producers', 'decided', 'keep', 'one', 'day', 'season', 'real', 'time', 'have', 'seem', 'argue', 'real', 'time', 'format', ""n't"", 'followed', 'closely', 'season', 'so', 'found', 'evidence', 'it.This', 'show', 'returning', 'characters', 'season', 'one', 'even', 'manages', 'bring', 'back', 'villainesses', 'Sherry', 'Palmer', 'Penny', 'Johnson', 'Jerald', 'Nina', 'Myers', 'Sarah', 'Clarke', 'believable', 'ways', 'story', 'mostly', 'self-contained', 'could', 'jump', 'here', 'wanted', 'watching', 'season', 'one', 'will', 'help', 'explain', 'relationships', 'increase', 'enjoyment', 'show', 'new', 'characters', 'help', 'build', 'story', 'season', 'two', 'Kate', 'sub-plot', 'place', 'least', 'third', 'way', 'season', 'when', 'begin', 'understand', 'how', 'everything', 'else', 'Kim', 'sub-plot', 'trying', 'leave', 'LA', 'out', 'believable', 'increasingly', 'ludicrous', 'day', 'main', 'storyline', 'however', 'moves', 'quickly', 'lots', 'twists', 'turns', 'episode', 'cliffhanger', 'will', 'make', 'want', 'keep', 'watching.After', 'success', 'season', 'one', 'DVD', 'release', 'season', 'producers', 'had', 'more', 'time', 'plan', 'DVD', 'set', 'twenty-four', 'episodes', 'are', 'preserved', 'six', 'discs', 'episode', 'shown', 'sharp', 'wide', 'screen', 'presented', 'surround', 'sound', 'Removing', 'complaint', 'season', 'one', 'Previously', '24', 'recap', 'included', 'can', 'skip', 'so', 'desire', 'Chapter', 'breaks', 'play', 'feature', 'are', 'also', 'included', 'discs', 'disc', 'one', 'audio', 'commentary', 'member', 'cast', 'crew', 'as', 'well', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'episodes.If', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'happy', 'check', 'out', 'seventh', 'disc', '44', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'one', 'place', 'optional', 'commentary', 'additional', 'are', 'two', 'featurettes', 'production', 'post-production', 'show', 'third', 'featurette', 'scenes', 'detail', 'bombing', 'CTU', 'early', 'season.Not', 'only', 'did', 'producers', 'step', 'up', 'plate', 'better', 'second', 'season', 'DVD', 'set', 'better', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'minor', 'sub-plot', 'complaints', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hamper', 'enjoyment', 'thriller', '24', 'season', 'two']",24: Season 2
749739,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00008YGRU,Mark Turner,"[1, 2]","I was not one of those that hooked up with the show 24 during its initial run. Matter of fact, I didn't fall in line for season two either. I felt that I couldn't find the time to make certain I was sitting in front of my television that one particular night each week. Nor could I be certain that I would have a tape ready to go. I now regret that decision.This is one of the most innovative concepts for a television program I have seen in some time. For those not in the know, the show takes place in one hour segments each episode. In other words, it is supposed to happen in real time. The only fault in this is that no one seems to eat or use the bathroom. But we'll forgive that and have no need to view either option.The stories have revolved around two central characters. The first is Jack Bauer (Kieffer Sutherland), an agent of the CTU (Central Terrorist Unit), an espionage agency determined to take down terrorists. Along with Jack we have his backup team and boss as well as his daughter Kim. During the first season, Jack's wife was killed by a terrorist Jack was pursuing, leaving him a broken man and causing him to leave the CTU.The second main character is President David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) and the members of Washington based powers that surround him. These include members of his cabinet and his ex-wife Sherry, a power player with her own interest and goals in mind.In the first series, Palmer was running for office and his life was saved by Jack, a man he now trusts implicitly. Then Palmer was running for office. Now as President the story shifts from gaining power to wielding it.The show begins at 8:00AM and the President's vacation plans are interrupted by the news that a terrorists organization has managed to smuggle in a nuclear weapon on US soil. And the bomb is set to go off sometime within the next 24 hours in Los Angeles. Palmer does what he thinks is best. He contacts the CTU and asks that Bauer be brought in to help deal with this problem.Bauer is in the midst of reconciliation with Kim. Meeting her at her new job as a nanny for an upper class LA couple, the pair reunites but has their time cut short by the President. Kim returns to her job only to find that her employer is a wife and child beater. She high tails it with the kid in tow and goes for help.Jack begins reluctantly begins his task of finding the nuke before it can be detonated on the condition that they get his daughter to safety. The promise is made but they can't follow through since she's on the run.Jack uses the most unorthodox methods to find the information he needs, going so far as to....well I won't say. To do so would be to blow one of the many surprises that this show pops out each episode.Along with this story is that of the President discovering that members of his staff are working against him throughout this event. Just who is behind it and who he can trust makes for as suspenseful a story as the Jack's search.All of these story arcs combine to make one stimulating viewing experience. You watch each one, get to the end and can't wait to start the next. I found myself checking the clock as each episode ended, wondering if I couldn't deal with perhaps one more less hour of sleep that night so that I could see what happened next.Everything about this series is fantastic. The direction keeps the flow of the story moving along at breakneck speed, using visual tricks to heighten the suspense. The story itself is a marvel as the threads of each story are combined to make on long narrative. While a TV show may seem like a chapter in a book, this one that runs 24 hours is like reading an entire novel when watched back to back.The acting in this series is some of the best I've seen on the small screen. Sutherland is totally believable in the role of rogue hero that does whatever it takes to get the job done. And Haysbert's performance as the President makes me want to go out and campaign for him tomorrow.Few shows have captured my imagination and enthusiasm like this one has. The last was perhaps THE X-FILES.

749747,A10CJINP7KBR4W,B00008YGRU,M. Herzog,"[0, 0]","This decade has suffered from far too many shows that had a great first season, but started to sink in later seasons.  Luckily, 24 avoided this trap, and produced a second season that was largely better than the first.  The story provided bigger stakes, and was largely more consistent as well as political than the first.  Jack Bauer's character developed, becoming far colder and harsher after the loss of his wife from season 1.  Without going too much into details, I was impressed with the stories, how they interwove, and how they were all linked together.  That is, with the exception of Kim Bauer, Jack's daughter.  This story was boring, bland, detracted from the story, and while it started fairly interesting, got to a point of frustration where I started fast-forwarding as I was so tired of her story (which I have never done in a show before).  I feel the writers wanted to keep the family elements from the first season around, but were having severe difficulty making it work.  That being said, this season was an improvement over an already great first season, which was already pretty great.I think its odd how often a show can have a great first season but fall into the sophomore slump for so many modern shows.

Filled with non-stop thrills, chills, excitement, devastating turn-of-events, tragedy and action, this second season proves to be a better success over the first one.  Make sure you've strapped your seatbelt in and prepare for one hell of a ride.It's been well over a year since the horrible events that happened to Jack Bauer and his family.  Not working for CTU anymore, Jack's life is a complete mess because he constantly blames himself for what happened to them.  Things drastically change when he gets a phone call from the President, telling him that there's a nuclear bomb that is set to go off in Los Angeles at any time during the day.  Bauer goes back to work for CTU and is once again faced with a 24-hour catastrophe that could very well bring the next World War.Again, I was hooked right after the first episode and wanted to watch more.  It's great to watch the season for the first time on DVD because you can watch as many episodes as you like.  I don't know if I could just watch one episode a week.  If you thought the first season was a real nail-biter, trust me, you haven't seen anything yet.  The second season offers more twists and turns that will make your body ache in every place.  You're afraid to watch, fearing that the worst could happen... but, you still do.  That's the kind of effect this show has on you.Be warned (again), this is NOT an easy show to watch.  Anything bad you think can happen most likely will.  They do not let you off easy with this show.  You will see some terrible things.  I'm shocked that this isn't on HBO instead of Fox, as I think they get away with a lot of stuff.  Then again, that's what's so great about it.  It literally breaks all of the rules.  The show gets very disturbing and hard to watch.  Just be prepared.The DVD set this time around is EXCELLENT; offering more features than before.  The show is widescreen, which really gives you the impression that you're watching a real movie.  The picture and sound quality is great, especially for a TV show.  Extra features included are over 40 deleted scenes, commentary for selected shows, featurettes and more.  There's even a 7th disk included that is dedicated to bonus material.  A great package, in my humble opinion.""24: Season Two"" is an addicting joy-ride that will leave you sweating and shaking.  It is almost impossible to only watch one episode; you're going to want to watch them all!  ""24"" is really an outstanding show that pushes the envelope every step of the way.  Get ready and expect the unexpected and think the unthinkable.  This is a rough and unpredictable ride that will leave you wanting more.",5,The Clock is Ticking...

Season 2 was better, though it still did some ""hokey"" stuff. Still centered a bit too much around Jack's daughter (did they intentionally write her as a ditz?). Nonetheless, this season upped the ante a bit, and was quite satisfying.As to packaging and the discs themselves: the first 4 seasons come in fold-out packaging + outer sleeve, much like the Highlander series and a few others. The first discs contain the episodes themselves, and the last disc contains some bonus materials.Season 2 did a much better job with chapter breaks, scene selection menus, and an added dis of bonus features, including deleted scenes, and featurettes. The video and audio were up to par. Of course I don't have a large-screen/wide-screen TV nor surround sound, so I can't test under all conditions. But if there were any video or audio issues I didn't notice them. Perhaps some moire/color issues in scenes with close parallel-line patterns. But I've noticed that on any number of DVD releases of other series from other studios, so I wouldn't say there was any more in 24 than other series.Overall, I highly recommend this for anyone who hasn't seen 24, and who likes the spy/thriller type show. If you liked Alias and/or La Femme Nikita, you'll probably like 24 as well.

He no longer works for the CTU, and he is trying to move on with his life by rebuilding a solid relationship with his daughter Kim (Elisha Cuthbert). Unfortunately, a terrorist threat has been announced, and over the course of the next 24 hours, a nuclear bomb is going to be detonated in Los Angeles. David Palmer ( Dennis Hayworth) is now president, and is faced with the challenge of containing the threat. The only person Palmer can turn to is obviously Jack Bauer- the man who saved his life. Now Jack must become the man he once was, and find out who is behind the nuclear bomb before it is too late...I was originally very skeptical when it came to season 2 of Fox's ground-breaking show &quot;24&quot;. Season 1 had incredible acting, nail-biting suspense, and a totally original format of airing each episode as an hour over the course of one day. I figured there was no way that FOX could pull off a second season that even came close. However, the show managed to become even better for season 2. The plot behind season 2 really hits home because of the events of 9/11. Another thing that was great, was the fact that season 2 managed to build off of the previous season when it came to the characters. Even though season 1 was based on a different set of events, the emotional fall out from that day is carried over into season 2, because of how great the acting was. Kiefer Sutherland, Dennis Hayworth, Elisha Cuthbert, Carlos Bernard ( Tony Almeida), Sarah Clarke ( Nina Myers), and Penny Johnson ( Sherry Palmer) are all back and are all fantastic. In fact, it was one of the most well rounded performances from a cast I have ever seen.The second season was even better than the first season in my opinion. However, the show was not the only thing that improved. The DVD itself took a complete 180 when it came to the special features that were offered. The first season DVD set did not really have any special features at all, or even any scene selection. The second time around, FOX made sure to correct their mistake. First of all, there is actually scene selection. You do not have to manually skip through the whole episode just to find a particular scene. The special features are great as well. The show itself fits over six discs. However, a seventh disc was created that contains nothing but extras. There are 44 deleted scenes, three incredible featuretes, and much more.

749759,A1E15WYG9C47X1,B00008YGRU,"""mobby_uk""","[2, 2]","I must admit that I did not expect the second season of 24 to be as exciting and thrilling as the first, and I had my doubts especially since it was using the same formula of real time events unfolding over the course of one day,and hence the originality factor that made the first season such a success is not there.Moreover, many friends have advised me that indeed Jack Bauer's second adventure was weaker.Yet two things I have learned after years of a passionate appreciation of cinema and good TV:Never let other opinions or reviews influence your own judgment, andNot being quite original does not mean a bad thing a all, if the writing, acting and direction are good enough to pull it off.So, watching the second season of 24, I was totally captivated from the very first hour till the very last..Indeed I found the second series of 24 to be far better in many ways, and this is why..First of all the familiarity with most of the characters ensured that the viewer sympathizes/connects with them from the very start, as opposed to taking maybe few 'hours' to be totally involved as with the original.Secondly, the writing was superb:While the first, despite the nail biting tension, twists and suspense, had a very simple and straightforward plot, an eye for an eye personal revenge, the second expands the possibilities much more, and delves into very dark and dangerous grounds, both on a international terrorism and domestic conspiracies levels. The writing is so good in fact that you will be excused in believing even for mere seconds, that you are watching more than the entertaining fiction that it really is.All actors involved are excellent, but I am surprised no one has mentioned one particular actor who was instrumental in lifting this second series up, and infusing a lot of humanity albeit tragic, and that is Xander Berkeley.He, in my opinion, gives the performance of his career , as does Berkeley's real life missus the lovely Sarah Clarke, who makes a comeback, and is chillingly transformed into this cold blooded assassin and traitor that we only saw few glimpses of in the closing minutes of the first season.Dennis Haysbert aka David Palmer now president,is not only a very able actor who added a lot of dignity and class to his role, but I must admit he makes one helluva president too!!!The twists and suspense in the second season never lapse for one second, up until the very last minute, which leaves the door open for lots of possibilities for the third season.I liked the fact that the plot in the second season was evenly divided into two sections, connected smoothly over these crucial 24 hours.. The hunt, against the clock for the nuke and the conspiracy inside Washington, and the shadowy men behind it all.Of course, the second series has its minor flaws: the sub plots involving the gorgeous Elisha Cuthbert were somehow weak in comparison to everything that was going on ..(a psycho abusive father, the loner nut case in the woods, the over the top deranged Latino father-to-be in the store..).All credit should go to all people involved in this wonderful series for the collective effort that has been put to produce quality television that is guaranteed to keep you glued to your screen, for 24 hours and more!

There are currently six seasons and season seven is planned for 2009. Each season has 6 discs, with 4 episodes per disc. Each episode covers approximately 1 hour of real-time drama although there are breaks for television advertising time meaning each episode lasts for about 45 min. To date there is approximately 6 days worth of 24 viewing. Each season is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next 24 days. It has won Emmy and Golden Globe awards. It has already achieved some of highest viewer rates for any television show. The discs are held in a cardboard and plastic flip holder. It slides into the slim line box. It is not that easy to remove but this increases the security of the discs. The sound is in 5:1 Dolby Digital and the show is shot in 1.78 : 1.The real-time nature makes it unique along with its split screen type editing where more than one scene can take place at a time. There is also the clock with its ominous digital ticking that seems more like a countdown even though it is moving forward in time. 24 Season 2 is incredible television. If you had to select the best seasons from any TV series then 24 Season 2 would easily rank up there. It is maybe the best TV action season you can own. So that says a lot. Also it mimics the mindset and politics back in 2003 with respect to post-911 events and the war in Iraq. It is dead-on interesting in hindsight to see Season 2 with respect to the current situation.24 season 2 is mostly about Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) who has left CTU (counter-terrorist unit) because of his wife's demise. Presidential candidate Senator David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) is now in office. Bauer's daughter Kim is working as a child minder for a rich but dangerous businessman. CTU learns that there is an atomic bomb about to go off in L.A today. Each episode becomes an edge of your seat thriller with lots of plot twists and character turns. From the bomb chase, to double-crossing, to NSA internal problems, torture, going to war, intelligence reports gone bad and a cabinet that is split on removing the President from office. Can Jack Bauer find a nuclear device, prove the intelligence reports wrong, save the President's career and the millions of people in LA in less than 24 hours? There hasn't been an action season like it!Overall the show has very high production values and the transfer quality of season 2 is exceptionally better than season 1 which was one of the early DVD TV releases and so sometimes the widescreen bars produced fluffy edges. Well that's gone now.

749775,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B00008YGRU,Patrick L. Randall,"[4, 6]","The first season of the genre-defining action-thriller &iexcl;24&iexcl; was a landmark of taught suspense, thrilling action, and inventive story telling.  Every single one of the 24 hours had viewers on the edge of their seats as they watched Counter-Terrorism Unit (CTU) agent Jack Bauer race against time to prevent the assassination of presidential candidate David Palmer and rescue his family from terrorists who wanted him dead.  Each episode was filled to the brim with depth and detail.  There were no wasted movements.  Whether it was David Palmer battling treachery within his own campaign or Jack Bauer uncovering another mind-bending twist the conspiracy, &iexcl;24&iexcl; produced some of the best, movie-quality TV to come along in years.  The thought on everyone&iexcl;s mind was, &iexcl;Is &iexcl;24&iexcl; a one-trick pony, or does it have legs for a second season that is as good at the first.&iexcl;  Fortunately for fans of Jack Bauer, David Palmer, and the show&iexcl;s unique format, the answer is an unqualified &iexcl;Yes!&iexcl;The end of Season One left Jack Bauer exhausted and heartbroken as, despite his best efforts, he could still not prevent the murder of his wife, Teri.  Interim literature such as Marc Cerasini&iexcl;s &iexcl;Findings at CTU&iexcl; reveals that Bauer left CTU not long after events of that day.  He is estranged from his daughter, Kim, and is just struggling to keep himself from ending it all.  Palmer, of course, went on to win the Presidency and is now faced with the worst crisis the Chief Executive could face, this side of 9/11 and Pearl Harbor.  Intelligence sources have revealed, with high confidence, that a fully armed nuclear bomb is set to be detonated in downtown Los Angeles at some point during that day.  CTU&iexcl;s best agents are on the case attempting to find the location of the bomb, but there is only one man who has both the background to find the bomb and President Palmer&iexcl;s utmost confidence in his ability to get the job done.  That man is Jack Bauer.  Sympathetic to Bauer&iexcl;s struggles, but in dire need of his help, Palmer speaks directly to Jack and enlists the help of current CTU director, George Mason, to get him back in the fold.  Upon realizing the weight of the task at hand, Jack agrees to return to active duty at CTU and embark on what would prove to be the second longest day of his life.My initial fear was that the plotting wouldn&iexcl;t be as tight and that it wouldn&iexcl;t generate the same level of intense emotion as the first season.  The first couple of episodes of Season Two do actually move slower than in Season, but soon the action picks up and &iexcl;24&iexcl; returns to the same level of quality it showed in its debut.  The richness of detail and depth of plotting are as prevalent as in the first season and perhaps even more so this year.  In addition the plot to detonate the nuclear bomb there is more of Kim getting into trouble, scheming within David Palmer&iexcl;s administration, plots against CTU, and subplot where suspicions that the Arab-born fianc of WASP-ish woman may be involved in the bomb plot come to the fore on the day of their wedding.  As much as I wish I could, I cannot reveal any more details about this season, lest viewing experience being ruined for you.  I should add, however, that in addition to be being a great overall season, one of its episodes (Episode 15, 10:00 pm C 11:00 pm) is one grittiest most dramatic television episodes I have ever seen on TV.  Its excellence rates it right up the annals of television history with &iexcl;Abyssinia, Henry&iexcl; from M*A*S*H and &iexcl;Love&iexcl;s Labour&iexcl; from ER.  You will understand when you see it.  Without a doubt, &iexcl;24: Season Two&iexcl; is as good, if not better, than the original &iexcl;24&iexcl;.",5,Wow!

Schneider,"[6, 6]","Executive-produced by its star, Kiefer Sutherland (who has made one of the most remarkable comebacks for an actor in recent history), &quot;24&quot; took a unique and innovative idea---film an entire day, hour by hour, over an entire season---and, instead of using it as a gimmick, let it be the starting pad for one of the most suspenseful, interesting, exciting, disturbing, engrossing and best dramatic series in TV history. This show has never let up from the beginning, and has only become more riveting ever since. In Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU) Agent Jack Bauer, Kiefer Sutherland has created a truly complex hero, and has deservingly revived his once-promising career that had been sagging for over a decade.The first season, which I got on DVD last year, concerned a double-whammy threat: An assassination plot against Presidential candidate Senator David Palmer (played nobly by veteran African-American actor Dennis Haysbert) and the kidnapping of Jack Bauer's daughter Kim (Elisha Cuthbert) and, eventually his wife Teri (Leslie Hope). Along the way, subplots are interwoven cleanly into the proceedings, such as Sen. Palmer's ambitious, scheming Lady MacBeth of a wife Sherry (Penny Johnson Jerald) and Jack Bauer's enigmatic colleague, and former lover, Agent Nina Myers (Sarah Clarke). The entire first season was a high-caliber rollercoaster ride all the way to its shocking and completely unpredictable conclusion.Season Two promised a no-less-intense rollercoaster ride as it concerned the threat of a nuclear bomb about to be set off in Los Angeles. Beginning 18 months after the events of the previous season's day, a much-embittered Jack Bauer is called upon by President David Palmer to help save the day. At the same time, Jack is highly concerned about keeping Kim out of the potential blast area. Unfortunately, it won't be easy for her as she is a live-in nanny to the young daughter of an abusive father. Also at the same time, a rich business owner named Bob Warner is about to marry off his younger daughter Marie to his trusted employee, a young British-raised Arab-American man named Reza, whom is suspected of being involved with terrorists by Bob's elder daughter, Kate Warner (Sarah Wynter). All of these plot threads come together, in ways that are completely surprising, exciting, suspenseful and spellbinding.Bottom line: If you loved Season One of &quot;24&quot; then you're gonna LOVE Season Two.

749795,A2KXYGIZI4I55D,B00008YGRU,Romulus,"[6, 8]","I'll save you a plot summary, obviously you can get that from the other 200 reviews written here. I will simply state my unworthy opinion. Let me just say that 24 made me believe in television again. After the X-files went down the drain and even Voyager got stupid on me and then with the horrible disgrace that is Enterprise entering the picture I swore I would never be faithful to an American TV series again. The suspense and unbelievable endings in this series are above the standards of most films and light years ahead of all current television. Season One, from start to finish never disappointed me, save for Teri Bauer. I'm sorry about it but she was just damned annoying. Kim seems to have followed in her mother's footsteps in this Season. She herself is not annoying but the writers just seem to put her in the most unbelievable and absurd situations in the entire series. I have seen all three seasons and I have to say that Season two is the low point. But it is still way better than anything else that is on television.Jack's rash actions in the first episode just seem to be there to bring back the old flame of his malicious, unrelenting character. What he does has little affect on the people he was trying to impress and is forgotten completely. The writers are at their very best in the President Palmer storyline. Damn, I wish he was our president. Anyhow, the way Palmer handles the situation before and especially after the Season's major mid-season climax provides a perfect foil for the blunders of the current administration as sort of dramatic ""what-should-have-been-done-in-the-first-place-you-jug-earred-baboon"" scenario. Also, after the early gaining of the audience's trust in unbelievable climaxes, the characters REALLY get a great chance to develop. I wouldn't mind seeing a version which edited out Kim save for her scenes with Jack. I don't think she is a bad actress, she just is in a lot of bad scenes and as an actress, she does a good job of putting on a good face in those idiotic situations. But honestly, the guy with the bomb shelter, the cougar scare, the Convenience store fiasco was all very horrible. It will make you wince and instinctively reach for the remote to fast forward to non-Kim parts. I felt the same during the amnesia episode with Teri Bauer in the first season. That dumb, blank look on her face made me want to scream. The third season, save for Chloe doesn't have any characters that I wanted to immediately see killed for reasons other than their being the villian. But even Chloe had redeeming qualities.In shortKiefer Sutherland and Dennis Haybert Perfect!Carlos Bernard and Reiko Aylesworth Wonderful!Sarah Clarke and Penny Marshal I love to hate them!Elisha Cuthbert A decent actress who finds her way into bad plotsXander Berkley, a so-so actor who found his way into an awesome plot this season which totally redeems him for his Season One roleNuclear Bomb Threat-Suspenseful and worthy of attention, it won't end the way you think it willThe Decision to invade or to not invade three Middle Eastern countries-handled with a remarkable integrity that will have you cheering for Palmer and wishing our President was as virtuous.The Mason family subplot, the suspicion of the Arab-American character Reza was a bit trite and annoying and Marie was unconvincing and a bit annoying.Nina and Sherry's roles-These two are so pitch perfect I don't mind seeing them even if there is no reason for them to be on screen. I never thought they had it in them to be who they are but they strike the right chord everytime.Summary-It has everything that you loved about the first season and will like about the third season but the Kim subplot is REALLY, REALLY BAD. Just fastforward just about every scene when she is not sharing the screen with Jack and you will have no regrets.The",4,Save for Kim's Storyline It's a Winner,1101859200,"12 1, 2004",2004,3844,"[""'ll"", 'save', 'plot', 'summary', 'obviously', 'can', 'get', 'other', '200', 'reviews', 'written', 'here', 'will', 'simply', 'state', 'unworthy', 'opinion', 'Let', 'just', 'say', '24', 'made', 'believe', 'television', 'again', 'X-files', 'went', 'drain', 'even', 'Voyager', 'got', 'stupid', 'then', 'horrible', 'disgrace', 'Enterprise', 'entering', 'picture', 'swore', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'faithful', 'American', 'TV', 'series', 'again', 'suspense', 'unbelievable', 'endings', 'series', 'are', 'standards', 'most', 'films', 'light', 'years', 'ahead', 'current', 'television', 'Season', 'One', 'start', 'finish', 'never', 'disappointed', 'save', 'Teri', 'Bauer', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'was', 'just', 'damned', 'annoying', 'Kim', 'have', 'followed', 'mother', 'footsteps', 'Season', 'not', 'annoying', 'writers', 'just', 'seem', 'put', 'most', 'unbelievable', 'absurd', 'situations', 'entire', 'series', 'have', 'seen', 'three', 'seasons', 'have', 'say', 'Season', 'two', 'low', 'point', 'still', 'way', 'better', 'anything', 'else', 'television.Jack', 'rash', 'actions', 'first', 'episode', 'just', 'seem', 'be', 'there', 'bring', 'back', 'old', 'flame', 'malicious', 'unrelenting', 'character', 'What', 'little', 'affect', 'people', 'was', 'trying', 'impress', 'forgotten', 'completely', 'writers', 'are', 'very', 'best', 'President', 'Palmer', 'storyline', 'Damn', 'wish', 'was', 'president', 'Anyhow', 'way', 'Palmer', 'situation', 'especially', 'Season', 'major', 'mid-season', 'climax', 'perfect', 'foil', 'blunders', 'current', 'administration', 'sort', 'dramatic', 'what-should-have-been-done-in-the-first-place-you-jug-earred-baboon', 'scenario', 'Also', 'early', 'gaining', 'audience', 'trust', 'unbelievable', 'climaxes', 'characters', 'REALLY', 'get', 'great', 'chance', 'develop', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'version', 'edited', 'out', 'Kim', 'save', 'scenes', 'Jack', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'bad', 'actress', 'just', 'lot', 'bad', 'scenes', 'actress', 'good', 'job', 'putting', 'good', 'face', 'idiotic', 'situations', 'honestly', 'guy', 'bomb', 'shelter', 'cougar', 'scare', 'Convenience', 'store', 'fiasco', 'was', 'very', 'horrible', 'will', 'make', 'wince', 'instinctively', 'reach', 'remote', 'fast', 'forward', 'non-Kim', 'parts', 'felt', 'same', 'amnesia', 'episode', 'Teri', 'Bauer', 'first', 'season', 'dumb', 'blank', 'look', 'face', 'made', 'want', 'scream', 'third', 'season', 'save', 'Chloe', ""n't"", 'have', 'characters', 'wanted', 'immediately', 'see', 'killed', 'reasons', 'other', 'being', 'villian', 'even', 'Chloe', 'had', 'redeeming', 'qualities.In', 'shortKiefer', 'Sutherland', 'Dennis', 'Haybert', 'Perfect', 'Carlos', 'Bernard', 'Reiko', 'Aylesworth', 'Wonderful', 'Sarah', 'Clarke', 'Penny', 'Marshal', 'love', 'hate', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'A', 'decent', 'actress', 'who', 'way', 'bad', 'plotsXander', 'Berkley', 'so-so', 'actor', 'who', 'found', 'way', 'awesome', 'plot', 'season', 'totally', 'Season', 'One', 'roleNuclear', 'Bomb', 'Threat-Suspenseful', 'worthy', 'attention', 'wo', ""n't"", 'end', 'way', 'think', 'Decision', 'invade', 'not', 'invade', 'three', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'countries-handled', 'remarkable', 'integrity', 'will', 'have', 'cheering', 'Palmer', 'wishing', 'President', 'was', 'virtuous.The', 'Mason', 'family', 'subplot', 'suspicion', 'Arab-American', 'character', 'Reza', 'was', 'bit', 'trite', 'annoying', 'Marie', 'was', 'unconvincing', 'bit', 'annoying.Nina', 'Sherry', 'roles-These', 'two', 'are', 'so', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'even', 'reason', 'be', 'screen', 'never', 'thought', 'had', 'be', 'who', 'are', 'strike', 'right', 'chord', 'everytime.Summary-It', 'everything', 'loved', 'first', 'season', 'will', 'like', 'third', 'season', 'Kim', 'subplot', 'REALLY', 'REALLY', 'BAD', 'Just', 'fastforward', 'just', 'scene', 'when', 'not', 'sharing', 'screen', 'Jack', 'will', 'have', 'regrets.The']",24: Season 2

749801,A3081Z4P774YR4,B00008YGRU,"""rsmon77""","[2, 2]","After such a surprisingly good first season (and one heckuva finale to boot), I had good expectations for the second season of ""24"".  After the first episode of year two, I had my expectations raised considerably.  Avoiding the ""sophomore slump"" most new TV shows tend to fall into, ""24"" managed to still be entertaining, and by no means boring.  After the tragic finale of season one, Jack Bauer (played to award-winning perfection by Kiefer Sutherland) finds himself isolated and unwilling to go back to work for the Counter-Terrorist Unit.  So it's with surprise that President David Palmer (played to award-deserving perfection by Dennis Haysbert), the man whose life he saved last season calls him for help to find a nuclear bomb which is believed to go off in Los Angeles before the end of the day.  He takes the assignment, but before its over, he will face off against terrorists, an old ally turned traitor, and certain death (over and over again).  This concept (24 hours=24 episodes) could easily fall flat on its face, but is held together by a solid ensemble cast and crew, incredible twists and turns, and unbeliveably relevant drama.  The seven-disc set is a new bar for TV on DVD, boasting several commentaries, nearly an hour of deleted scenes, a great two-part documentary on the last episodes of the season, and a look the work it takes to make those slick split-screen sequences.  All in all, a better than average collection for a solid season of great drama and action (And if you're not waiting for season three after this, I'd honestly recommend checking your pulse).",5,"""24"": Season Two",1063411200,"09 13, 2003",2003,1591,"['surprisingly', 'good', 'first', 'season', 'one', 'heckuva', 'finale', 'boot', 'had', 'good', 'expectations', 'second', 'season', '24', 'first', 'episode', 'year', 'two', 'had', 'expectations', 'raised', 'considerably', 'Avoiding', 'sophomore', 'slump', 'most', 'new', 'TV', 'shows', 'tend', 'fall', '24', 'managed', 'still', 'be', 'entertaining', 'means', 'boring', 'tragic', 'finale', 'season', 'one', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'played', 'award-winning', 'perfection', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'isolated', 'unwilling', 'go', 'back', 'work', 'Counter-Terrorist', 'Unit', 'surprise', 'President', 'David', 'Palmer', 'played', 'award-deserving', 'perfection', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'man', 'life', 'saved', 'last', 'season', 'help', 'find', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'believed', 'go', 'off', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'end', 'day', 'assignment', 'over', 'will', 'face', 'off', 'terrorists', 'old', 'ally', 'turned', 'traitor', 'certain', 'death', 'over', 'again', 'concept', '24', 'hours=24', 'episodes', 'could', 'easily', 'fall', 'flat', 'face', 'held', 'together', 'solid', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'crew', 'incredible', 'twists', 'turns', 'unbeliveably', 'relevant', 'drama', 'seven-disc', 'set', 'new', 'bar', 'TV', 'DVD', 'boasting', 'several', 'commentaries', 'nearly', 'hour', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'great', 'two-part', 'documentary', 'last', 'episodes', 'season', 'look', 'work', 'make', 'slick', 'split-screen', 'sequences', 'better', 'average', 'collection', 'solid', 'season', 'great', 'drama', 'action', ""'re"", 'not', 'waiting', 'season', 'three', ""'d"", 'honestly', 'recommend', 'checking', 'pulse']",24: Season 2
749802,AK7IDQJN31163,B00008YGRU,Ryan,"[20, 25]","...And the countdown is on!  One of the compelling themes that runs through 24 is the idea that someone, somewhere, is always running out of time.  That's a notion that we can all identify with on many levels.  Throw in a nuclear bomb scheduled to be detonated somewhere in Los Angeles, a group of renegade terrorists who control the bomb and a retired agent with a tragic past, and you've got a recipe for suspense, action and the unexpected.  The major strength of 24 has always been its ability to be twisted and unpredictable.  Although some of the surprises aren't as shocking as those in the first season of the show, there are more than enough to ratchet up the tension in this drama until the viewer's nerves become taught with anticipation.  Kiefer Sutherland proved himself a top-notch actor in the first season of this unique series and he returns as Federal Agent Jack Bauer.  Bauer is a man haunted by his own demons; the tragic death of his wife and the estrangement of his daughter Kim.  The last thing he wants to do is help his old friends at CTU with another mission.  But he can't bring himself to say no to President David Palmer when he is asked to help hunt down a nuclear bomb somewhere in L.A.  Jack is dragged into the middle of it all and finds himself working undercover with a McVeigh-like group of domestic terrorists, a path that will ultimately lead him to a forced alliance with his arch nemesis, Nina Myers (Sarah Clark), the traitor who killed Jack's wife in the explosive finale of season one.  The scenes between jack and Nina are probably the most electrifying and intense during the course of the day.  Once they worked as partners and lovers, and now they must track down the bomb with an ever-present sense of murderous ferocity between them.  Meanwhile, Palmer (Dennis Haysbert), must deal with a conspiracy within his own administration, lead by those who seek to remove him from power any way they can.  Things become more complicated when Palmer's duplicitous ex wife, Sherry (Penny Johnson Jerald), arrives on the scene claiming to have information that will help the President during this crisis.  Other familiar faces return from the first season, including the rye Tony Almeda (Carlos Bernard), the loyal Mike Novick (Jude Ciccolella) and the apathetic George Mason (Xander Berkeley).  Mason was a minor character during the previous season, but his role in this day's events becomes important as he is forced to face his own destiny.  We also meet a young lady who is about to marry a Middle Eastern businessman who may or not be a terrorist.  The weakest plot thread throughout Day Two involves Kim Bauer (Elisha Cuthbert).  Many fans found her exploits annoying during the first season when she was more central to the story, but during this day of building terror, she seems to serve as little more than filler as she tries to help a little girl flea Los Angeles and her abusive father.  The purpose of the writers seems to be to put Kim in every conceivable terrifying scenario, from a hostage situation in a convenience store to an unexpected encounter in the woods with a cougar.  Still, while they are irritating, the Kim story line doesn't detract from the excellent suspense of the other major plots as Jack hunts down the nuclear bomb and tries to prevent a war from being waged by the U.S. in the Middle East.  The real-time format in which each episode represents one hour in this day-long period may create implausibility at times, but its easy to forgive the writers when the tension is razor sharp.The extras in this DVD package are superb and are far superior to the meager offerings of the Season One set.  We are given 44 deleted scenes that can be branched into the shows, episode commentary from all major stars and producers and three behind-the-scenes documentaries that take up an entire bonus disk.  The picture quality is excellent and the sound is in clear Dolby 5.1 dynamics.  Many fans have compared the two seasons and there seems to be a split decision as to which one is better.  While I personally lean a bit more toward season one as the better story offering, both seasons are excellent and I encourage every viewer to check out both packages and decide for yourself.  Whether you prefer season one or two, you won't be disappointed with either.  It is well worth the money you would invest to own the box set.  Once you start watching, you won't be able to stop.  Like the previous season, 24 is one hell of a wild ride from start to finish.",5,Day Two: Countdown to Destruction,1063411200,"09 13, 2003",2003,4525,"['countdown', 'One', 'compelling', 'themes', '24', 'idea', 'someone', 'somewhere', 'always', 'running', 'time', 'notion', 'can', 'identify', 'many', 'levels', 'Throw', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'scheduled', 'be', 'detonated', 'somewhere', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'group', 'renegade', 'terrorists', 'who', 'control', 'bomb', 'retired', 'agent', 'tragic', 'past', ""'ve"", 'got', 'recipe', 'suspense', 'action', 'unexpected', 'major', 'strength', '24', 'always', 'been', 'ability', 'be', 'twisted', 'unpredictable', 'surprises', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'shocking', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'are', 'more', 'enough', 'ratchet', 'up', 'tension', 'drama', 'viewer', 'nerves', 'become', 'taught', 'anticipation', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'proved', 'top-notch', 'actor', 'first', 'season', 'unique', 'series', 'Federal', 'Agent', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'Bauer', 'man', 'haunted', 'own', 'demons', 'tragic', 'death', 'wife', 'estrangement', 'daughter', 'Kim', 'last', 'thing', 'do', 'help', 'old', 'friends', 'CTU', 'mission', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'say', 'President', 'David', 'Palmer', 'when', 'asked', 'help', 'hunt', 'down', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'somewhere', 'L.A.', 'Jack', 'dragged', 'middle', 'working', 'undercover', 'McVeigh-like', 'group', 'domestic', 'terrorists', 'path', 'will', 'ultimately', 'lead', 'forced', 'alliance', 'arch', 'nemesis', 'Nina', 'Myers', 'Sarah', 'Clark', 'traitor', 'who', 'killed', 'Jack', 'wife', 'explosive', 'finale', 'season', 'one', 'scenes', 'jack', 'Nina', 'are', 'probably', 'most', 'electrifying', 'intense', 'course', 'day', 'worked', 'partners', 'lovers', 'now', 'must', 'track', 'down', 'bomb', 'ever-present', 'sense', 'murderous', 'ferocity', 'Meanwhile', 'Palmer', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'must', 'deal', 'conspiracy', 'own', 'administration', 'lead', 'who', 'seek', 'remove', 'power', 'way', 'can', 'Things', 'become', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'Palmer', 'duplicitous', 'ex', 'wife', 'Sherry', 'Penny', 'Johnson', 'Jerald', 'scene', 'claiming', 'have', 'information', 'will', 'help', 'President', 'crisis', 'Other', 'familiar', 'return', 'first', 'season', 'including', 'rye', 'Tony', 'Almeda', 'Carlos', 'Bernard', 'loyal', 'Mike', 'Novick', 'Jude', 'Ciccolella', 'apathetic', 'George', 'Mason', 'Xander', 'Berkeley', 'Mason', 'was', 'minor', 'character', 'previous', 'season', 'role', 'day', 'events', 'important', 'forced', 'face', 'own', 'destiny', 'also', 'meet', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'marry', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'businessman', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'terrorist', 'weakest', 'plot', 'thread', 'Day', 'Two', 'Kim', 'Bauer', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'Many', 'fans', 'found', 'annoying', 'first', 'season', 'when', 'was', 'more', 'central', 'story', 'day', 'building', 'terror', 'serve', 'as', 'little', 'more', 'filler', 'help', 'little', 'girl', 'flea', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'abusive', 'father', 'purpose', 'writers', 'be', 'put', 'Kim', 'conceivable', 'terrifying', 'scenario', 'hostage', 'situation', 'convenience', 'store', 'unexpected', 'encounter', 'woods', 'cougar', 'Still', 'are', 'irritating', 'Kim', 'story', 'line', ""n't"", 'detract', 'excellent', 'suspense', 'other', 'major', 'plots', 'Jack', 'down', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'tries', 'prevent', 'war', 'being', 'waged', 'U.S.', 'Middle', 'East', 'real-time', 'format', 'episode', 'one', 'hour', 'day-long', 'period', 'may', 'create', 'implausibility', 'times', 'easy', 'forgive', 'writers', 'when', 'tension', 'razor', 'sharp.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'package', 'are', 'superb', 'are', 'far', 'superior', 'meager', 'offerings', 'Season', 'One', 'set', 'are', 'given', '44', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'can', 'be', 'branched', 'shows', 'episode', 'commentary', 'major', 'stars', 'producers', 'three', 'behind-the-scenes', 'documentaries', 'take', 'up', 'entire', 'bonus', 'disk', 'picture', 'quality', 'excellent', 'sound', 'clear', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'dynamics', 'Many', 'fans', 'have', 'compared', 'two', 'seasons', 'there', 'be', 'split', 'decision', 'one', 'better', 'personally', 'lean', 'bit', 'more', 'season', 'one', 'better', 'story', 'offering', 'seasons', 'are', 'excellent', 'encourage', 'viewer', 'check', 'out', 'packages', 'decide', 'prefer', 'season', 'one', 'two', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'well', 'money', 'would', 'invest', 'own', 'box', 'set', 'start', 'watching', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'stop', 'previous', 'season', '24', 'one', 'hell', 'wild', 'ride', 'start', 'finish']",24: Season 2

749808,A3H8PVQG3IW4JU,B00008YGRU,Sho Uesugi,"[5, 10]","Popular reviews on Amazon are normally those that go with the flow. So I don't expect this to be popular.I avoided watching this show years ago when it first aired because just from the buzz it received, I felt like it was too over the top and unrealistic to be of interest to me. However, someone gave me the 2nd season as a gift and I decided to watch it while working.Alfred Hitchcock was quite astute when he identified the ""suspension of disbelief"" as a key component to keep any drama believable - particularly those that involved ""suspense"". 24 does the opposite, and for a purpose. While not overtly political in tone, the show not-so-subtle message smuggles in a range of stereotypes, and situations that are both contrived and ludicrous in their intensity and repetition.As opposed to the real world where Islamic terrorists are not supported by a ""right wing"" conspiracy, in 24, that's the name of the game. The ideal Obama-like President is being undermined by secret cabal of -- get this -- American business, oil and military interests, that want to push him into various middle eastern wars. And to accomplish this, they are prepared to bomb or risk bombing a major American city with a nuke. You heard me - the ahem...Republicans are out to nuke us, because we need oil. Sound familiar?It get's better. Blond, spoiled valley girls are part of the conspiracy, because they have fallen for mysterious middle eastern men in the past and their love brought them to the point of wanting to murder millions. In between ""likes"" and ""whatevers"", we hear Arabic in hushed tones, plans to destroy our civilization. Just so we can see that even Alicia Silverstone could indeed become a terrorist. Just because it hasn't happened, does not mean that it won't tomorrow. This is what passes for believability on 24.ALL ethnic/gender groups and skin shades portrayed in this series are a caricature of a caricature. The aggressive, irrational latino who is both kind hearted but shoots everyone is sight. The right wing hunter hick, in the forest, in a cabin, with a bomb shelter who wants to abduct cute blond girls and keep them prisoner. The fat, rude 7-11 operator who care nothing for his fellow man, just twinkies. The two catty females who work together but hate each other, and bring the naive man into their little game (women can't be assertive, rational in the ""24"" universe, without being ""b-tchy""). The black lady who is domineering with a ""street-vibe"", sexual and sassy like something off of the old sitcom 227. The out of control hyper-aggressive hippy white man in Bauer that is out to save the world from...like everything...without any semblance of rationality except that everyone is somehow wrong and out to get him, and everyone else. The new type of James Bond, without brains except to see what's right in front of him.Let's also not forget the American miliary/special forces in the film, who are out of control, and killing everyone (mostly Americans) - best is that they have a ""don't tread on me"" style tattoo on their arm - how amusing. Jefferson would spin in his grave.-- Actually, the only people that come off looking human are the Muslim Terrorists, and leaders of Islamic regimes. They're the main victims here. Victims of evil American business/military conspiracies and at the end of the day, don't really want to hurt anyone. Most give up before the job is even done especially when someone offers to help them fix a flat tire.You would think that perhaps before republicans nuke LA, they would first look for oil in um...Alaska lolAnd the worst, most insane thing about this program - Bauer's daughter who every 5 minutes gets hit with a firestorm of trouble, more than even Bauer himself! Ridiculous.Now understand. I know that there are people who benefit from middle eastern wars. I know that some people in the US might hope for a nuke to go off. But really...this show is so much contrived silliness. I mean, every scene - from Bauer jumping at the chance to kill himself, to the evil female spy who is Bauer's nemesis - and can kill with cardboard like Shibumi, to the President who seems like his acting outclasses everyone around him, like he's on another show...it's just such a silly mess of a plot...you do indeed have to see it to believe it.When I watch a film or tv show, I'm not interested in an argument against a political group in the US. I want to be entertained. And while 24 can be fun and exciting, it has the brainpower of a B Chuck Norris film but with the badguys reversed into being evil capitalists bent on world domination, through using poor middle eastern terrorists as pawns. We have heard this story before. The bottom line is that radical islam is the enemy in the world of cloak and dagger, and these types of shows need to accept that before the thinking public will accept them. Luckily, tv audiences are more into emotion than rationality, and romantic realism is a dead concept in art. So we are left with this as a substitute.If you ever get a chance to see Sandbaggers, or read an old LeCarre novel, you will get what a real spy drama is all about.",1,RIDICULOUS x 1000,1320192000,"11

Virtually all the characters from series one are back in the show, so the President, his wife, Nina, Mason, Tony and Michelle are all involved. Its very cleverly written with multiple over-lapping stories that will keep you guessing all the time. There is political intrigue, family drama, terrorism and enough tension to last you a year let alone 24 hours.Not having seen series 3 yet I have no idea whether the end of series 2 is relevent or not, but it certainly took me by surprise.

Some of the events of season two include:  murder, kidnapping, and the president's cabinet considering invoking the 25th Amendment to revmove him from power.Although most of the action was great, I have only given it four stars as the various plots surrounding Bauer's daughter Kim are just too frequent and far fetched.  In the span of 24 hours (the show is in real time), she gets herself involved in countless forms of danger and threats to her life and wellbeing.

That means if you're a woman, no matter how proud and mentally sound, you better stand back and let the men do their jobs.  As with Season 1, CTU is a boy's club.  The females - whether employed by the U.S. government, or merely related to such employees - are relegated to the proverbial ""damsels in distress"" role that went out with the great feminist uprising of the 1970s.  Kiefer and Co. need to wake up and smell the coffee.  We women may not be as physically strong as our brawnier counterparts, but mentally we are at least as sharp (and often can focus better on difficult work).  I fear the revealing of plot points, so I will not go into great detail.  Suffice it to say that, while I was able to sort of forget the misogynistic undertones of Season 1, Season 2 establishes a pattern that continues unchecked throughout the series.That said, Season 2 is a wilder, less predictable ride than Season 1.

Kim's role seemed very feeble when watching it week by week, but appeared much more satisfactory when watching it like this.To a lesser extent this applied to the other characters and the plot development as a whole, with any plot holes being less obvious, since the viewer is kept in the loop for much longer periods of time, as the hours segue into one another.I was also impressed by how well this series looks, in terms of its lighting and set- design.My only gripe is the short to-black pauses as some scenes cut from one character's section to another.

After watching Season 2 in its entirety, it was somewhat of a letdown, but nonetheless, it delivered the same suspense and thrills the first one dished out.The second season takes place 18 months after the events of the first season and it ranges from 8:00pm to 8:00am.  Jack Bauer, played wonderfully by Kiefer Sutherland, returns as a broken man, obviously because of the Season 1 finale.  Kim has disowned Jack and he finds himself lonely and distraught.  Meanwhile, David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert), who ran in the presidential primary in Season 1, is the new commander-in-chief of the United States.  President Palmer calls Bauer back on duty, on a dangerous mission to thwart the detonation of a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles.  Bauer has the dark mentality of a rogue, feeling as if he has nothing to live for.  In short, Bauer is a good guy, thinking more like a bad guy.  With each hour, Bauer discovers the government conspiracy behind the terrorist threat and it all leads up to the final hour, where Bauer must in essence, save Palmer's presidency and the world, for that matter.The second season of 24 seems to reflect the touchy, changing times and further onward into the waning hours, it reflects the social and political problems of the world today.  Despite the influenced plot and the relatively predictable line of events, 24 carries on the quality of the first season.  The cast, especially Sutherland and Haysbert, is stellar as usual and of course, the nail-biting developments and tone are awesome and cerebral.  For those just new to the phenomenon of 24, I advise that you watch Season 1 first before this second set because your understanding of the story is greatly enhanced.",5,"Not as Unpredictable as the 1st, but Doesn't Disappoint",1055462400,"06 13, 2003",2003,1851,"['Personally', 'hype', '24', 'sequel', 'season', 'had', 'received', 'was', 'somewhat', 'skeptical', 'Season', '2', 'could', 'outdo', 'riveting', 'success', 'was', 'Season', '1', 'watching', 'Season', '2', 'entirety', 'was', 'somewhat', 'letdown', 'nonetheless', 'delivered', 'same', 'suspense', 'first', 'one', 'dished', 'second', 'season', 'place', '18', 'months', 'events', 'first', 'season', '8:00pm', '8:00am', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'broken', 'man', 'obviously', 'Season', '1', 'finale', 'Kim', 'disowned', 'Jack', 'lonely', 'distraught', 'Meanwhile', 'David', 'Palmer', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'who', 'ran', 'presidential', 'primary', 'Season', '1', 'new', 'commander-in-chief', 'United', 'States', 'President', 'Palmer', 'Bauer', 'back', 'duty', 'dangerous', 'mission', 'thwart', 'detonation', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Bauer', 'dark', 'mentality', 'rogue', 'feeling', 'nothing', 'live', 'short', 'Bauer', 'good', 'guy', 'thinking', 'more', 'bad', 'guy', 'hour', 'Bauer', 'government', 'conspiracy', 'terrorist', 'threat', 'up', 'final', 'hour', 'where', 'Bauer', 'must', 'essence', 'save', 'Palmer', 'presidency', 'world', 'matter.The', 'second', 'season', '24', 'reflect', 'touchy', 'changing', 'times', 'further', 'onward', 'waning', 'hours', 'social', 'political', 'problems', 'world', 'today', 'influenced', 'plot', 'relatively', 'predictable', 'line', 'events', '24', 'quality', 'first', 'season', 'cast', 'especially', 'Sutherland', 'Haysbert', 'stellar', 'usual', 'course', 'nail-biting', 'developments', 'tone', 'are', 'awesome', 'cerebral', 'just', 'new', 'phenomenon', '24', 'advise', 'watch', 'Season', '1', 'first', 'second', 'set', 'understanding', 'story', 'greatly', 'enhanced']",24: Season 2

The show has a premise that is not just intriguing but it guarantees that viewers will stick it out for all twenty four episodes. The flaw of course being that anyone who misses the first 5 or 6 episodes will be (for the most part) lost and will be turned off to tuning in so late in the game. The show creates real tension and Jack Bauer is a very good if sometimes over the top character. My only problem is the twists become more and more ridiculous as the season goes on. It seems they throw in everything and anything to keep viewers guessing. The kim sub plots are not only painful to watch but frustratingly stupid. From trying to save a little girl to encountering mountain lions it seems the writers have very little for Kim to do, why not just write her off the show? I hate to think they actually gave her a job in CTU in the next season. I am not looking forward to more of her lame hijinks. I couldn't help but laugh when one character turns out to be a terrorist. COME ONE NOW! That was just dumb. (You know what I'm talking about.)The show is ultimately flawed by its own premise. One story just can't hold for 24 episodes, no matter how hard they try.

Of course, Wayne was in some ways the personification of a certain image of America, and I wonder if this is part of the appeal of ""24"", the fact that this is how Americans see themselves, as the perennial Good Guy.

OK, the storyline involving Kim Bauer is silly, but the main plot is a brilliantly-conceived and -performed bit of television, with a multitude of plot twists and turns, surprises, people turning out to be something other than they first appeared and cliff-hanging endings. Some of it is just a bit too pat and Jack's physical abilities in an exhausted and injured state just too superhuman, but at the end of each episode, you're panting for the next one.

It is in short unmissable television.  Early on you are lead to believe the terrorist threat is from islamic militants and although there is involvement from them the threat is a little more American, and closer to home.  The way the plot turns dramatically at every turning keeps you on the edge of your seat, and though the concept has obviously been used before it does not tire at all.  There are great appearances from Xander Berkeley as the heroic George Mason, now much more involved than in the first series and the devious Sherry Palmer, who figures later in the series.  David Palmer and Jack Bauer are once again played superbly by Dennis Haysbert and Keifer Sutherland.  The only real criticism I have is with the role of Kim Bauer, she was integral to the story in series 1, however in this series her escapades are really irrelavant to the main story.  She was a very popular character so I can see why they were keen to keep her in, but they could have thought about how to use her better.

Big mistake: This second season rocks and hooked me so bad that I had to watch 4 episodes at a time.Naturally, I thought this would be another soapy action series. The writing is so good that lots of fluff is eliminated and you are treated to a cerebral adventure. This show hits the right topic at the right time. Terrorists could place a nuclear device in a major US city.I won't rehash the plots as you can get them off the 24 hour site.

Great sound! I wonder if I can get the same sound from my TV. If not, another vote for buying the DVD.Also, I work long hours and thus this raises a question: why bother to record or watch each week, when the convenience of the DVD makes viewing more enjoyable and practical.Thus, should I watch the third season or just buy the DVD? I will buy the DVD as I would hate to miss even one episode.There are few time wasters such as stupid car chase scenes, long dying dialogs, or love story complications. Yes, there is some romance, but thank God the writers don't waste time with 'getting to know you&quot;, useless bedroom scenes, shower scenes, crying &quot;I love you scenes&quot;.

Too much of the same will lead to stagnation, while too much change will actually alienate loyal viewers.  24, however, is a completely new breed of show and thus does not adhere to the typical critiques of TV drama.Essentially, the second season of 24 follows the same parameters as the first.  Over the course of a single day, CTU (Counter-Terrorism Unit) agent Jack Bauer must get himself (and the nation) out of a crisis...this time when a nuclear bomb is set to detonate in Los Angeles and could prompt World War 3 if the plot succeeds.  Of course, besides Bauer, a host of other characters (Kim Bauer, Tony Almeida, George Mason, etc.) round out the cast.  The twists and turns are just as mind-blowing as the first go-round, yet it never seems to get old due to the great acting and straight-forward plot devices (every episode ends with a new huge twist).The biggest reason the Season Two succeeds, though, is that much more time is devoted to the character of Jack Bauer, who really is the fulcrum of the show.  The episodes in which the raging, frenetic Jack takes center stage will have you on the edge of your seat and literally cheering out loud!  Whereas in the first half of the first season Bauer was little more than a concerned parent, this entire season sees him wriggling his way out of tight spot after tight spot...MacGyver has nothing on Jack Bauer.  I never thought I would find an actor who brings more intensity to his role than Matthew Fox gives to Jack Shepard on LOST, but Kiefer Sutherland's Jack Bauer eclipses him.So, if you were intrigued (or completely thrilled!) by the first season of 24, this second season will not let you down.

When I finally did, I enjoyed it, but it rang a bit hollow to me.  This second season is much better, especially Keifer Sutherland.  The dark and disturbed edge of Jack Bauer this season brings much more depth to his character and is never overblown.  While I originally thought offing his wife in the first season was a mistake, it led to a great change in his character.  Xander Berkley as George Mason is also a very well done tragic character.My main complaint is Kim.  My friend called her ""a walking Darwin award"" and I couldn't agree more.  There seems to be a problem in 24 with most of the women being either stupid or manipulative (which is another reason not to give this 5 stars), but she's by far the dumbest.  Whenever they go to her subplot I cringe, and then laugh while they're playing out.  I see the need for a tie to Jack's family, but the writers either need to get her better integrated into the story, stop her from running into every sleazy guy stereotype (the loner militia guy, the cartoonish wife beater), or just get rid of her altogether.Otherwise, I really enjoy this show.
