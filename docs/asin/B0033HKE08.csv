1320122,A19KLWTEW9KRJ8,B0033HKE08,Alexis,"[0, 0]","Didn't know what to expect with this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. There were some scenes that didn't make a lot of sense like how they just move into this huge mansion and their little boy goes wandering off and nobody seems to care where he is. Also the star of the movie is a short red head yet her sisters and brother are the like 9 feet tall Nordic looking blondes. But none of that really mattered. The movie had me in suspense the whole time. It was very unpredictable and a lot of fun. There was no nudity or sex and minor cussing. Not a lot of bloody gore or anything either. I would recommend it as a fun Halloween movie. My hubby enjoyed it as well.",5,Knife Edge,1382400000,"10 22, 2013",2013,669,"['Did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'movie', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'were', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'how', 'just', 'move', 'huge', 'mansion', 'little', 'boy', 'wandering', 'off', 'nobody', 'care', 'where', 'Also', 'star', 'movie', 'short', 'red', 'head', 'yet', 'sisters', 'brother', 'are', 'like', '9', 'feet', 'tall', 'Nordic', 'looking', 'blondes', 'none', 'really', 'mattered', 'movie', 'had', 'suspense', 'whole', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'unpredictable', 'lot', 'fun', 'was', 'nudity', 'sex', 'minor', 'cussing', 'Not', 'lot', 'bloody', 'gore', 'anything', 'either', 'would', 'recommend', 'fun', 'Halloween', 'movie', 'hubby', 'enjoyed', 'as', 'well']",N/A
1320123,A22K5CUTUGJMAA,B0033HKE08,Brian,"[6, 8]","What a mess.  This pastiche of murder-mystery/psychological-thriller/haunted-house cliches tries to coast along on autopilot, its disjointed, psuedo-Hitchcockian plot borrowing greedily from an array of superior sources ('Gaslight,' 'The Shining' and any of various takes on 'The Turn of the Screw' most obviously), but gets bogged down by a muddled script, indecisive pacing and an overabundance of hand-me-down images and characters that seem not to know which genre they belong to.  The dialogue, especially in scenes that require a shade of jargonistic authenticity (e.g., the opener at the Wall Street brokerage, Henri's urgent business dealings and the legal jockeying for control of the son's trust), is weak and so follows the bulk of the acting.  Perhaps the creators thought they couldn't miss if they tossed enough familiar ingredients into the stew-- well, with the exception of some slick photography, they missed the pot altogether.  1 1/2 stars.If you're in the market for a satisfyingly atmospheric supernatural mystery/thriller, check out 1995's 'Haunted,' 1981's 'The Changeling,' 1973's 'Don't Look Now' or 1961's 'The Innocents.'",2,Euro-natural hash,1312675200,"08 7, 2011",2011,1149,"['What', 'mess', 'pastiche', 'murder-mystery/psychological-thriller/haunted-house', 'cliches', 'tries', 'coast', 'along', 'autopilot', 'disjointed', 'psuedo-Hitchcockian', 'plot', 'borrowing', 'greedily', 'array', 'superior', 'sources', ""'Gaslight"", ""'The"", 'Shining', 'various', ""'The"", 'Turn', 'Screw', 'most', 'obviously', 'bogged', 'down', 'muddled', 'script', 'indecisive', 'pacing', 'overabundance', 'hand-me-down', 'images', 'characters', 'seem', 'not', 'know', 'genre', 'belong', 'dialogue', 'especially', 'scenes', 'require', 'shade', 'jargonistic', 'authenticity', 'e.g.', 'opener', 'Wall', 'Street', 'brokerage', 'Henri', 'urgent', 'business', 'dealings', 'legal', 'jockeying', 'control', 'son', 'trust', 'weak', 'so', 'bulk', 'acting', 'Perhaps', 'creators', 'thought', 'could', ""n't"", 'miss', 'tossed', 'enough', 'familiar', 'ingredients', 'stew', 'well', 'exception', 'slick', 'photography', 'missed', 'pot', 'altogether', '1', '1/2', 'stars.If', ""'re"", 'market', 'satisfyingly', 'atmospheric', 'supernatural', 'mystery/thriller', 'check', '1995', ""'Haunted"", '1981', ""'The"", 'Changeling', '1973', ""'Do"", ""n't"", 'Look', 'Now', '1961', ""'The"", 'Innocents']",N/A
1320124,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B0033HKE08,Compay,"[2, 3]","Knife Edge is an average psychological horror film.  And it shouldn't be, considering the cast.  What immediately caught my attention was that it starred the lovely Natalie Press, whom I previously enjoyed in Fifty Dead Men Walking.  Add award-winning actress Joan Plowright into the mix, and you have the potential for a terrific movie.The problem?  The story isn't very original.  The ""spooky home with a secret"" concept has simply been overdone.  The scariest elements of the film either borrow from different movies (the Orphanage, Changeling), or are recycled from others.  How many films feature a scene where someone opens a medicine cabinet, grabs what they need, and closes it only to be surprised by what's in the reflection?  Yet a veteran horror director still chose to include such a scene in this movie.The film doesn't grab your attention until it reaches the halfway mark, and it doesn't gain steam until the final 15 minutes.  Some of the earlier clues in the film also make the conclusion fairly predictable.I wanted to enjoy this movie given the cast, but it simply brought nothing new to the table as far as psychological horror films go.

This movie is not as bad as all that!Granted I didn't know any of the actors, except for Joan Plowright (who I adore, by the way), but overall, they didn't do a bad job at all.  Some of the dialogue seemed contrived, yet what movie doesn't have a line or two that doesn't make you tilt your head and wonder what they were thinking when the wrote it?Overall, a suspenseful mood is set, lighting, props, atmosphere, all were used to the greatest advantage and there were several moments that really made me jump.I think this movie is definitely worth a viewing.  It's not horrible at all.  It's not the greatest story ever told, but if you are looking for a good suspenseful scare, this just might be it.  If I were you, I'd ignore the nay-sayers and give it a try.
