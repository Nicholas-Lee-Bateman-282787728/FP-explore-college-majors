42606,ALR35EFI69S5R,0783112750,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[139, 151]","The opening scene in this HBO movie is perhaps one of the grittiest and most realistic depictions of the realities of combat ever filmed, at least this side of the first 30 minutes of `Saving Private Ryan'. The viewer is  immediately transported into the surreal world of death, decay, and  destruction, where the panorama in view is a smoke-seared scene that the  young soldiers labor through in the midst of all this horror. In this  excellent depiction of General Omar Bradley's ill-fated decision to strike  deep into the forbidding terrain of the  Hurtigen Forest, accuracy and  detail are everywhere one looks. The situation described in the film is  quite accurate, and the young cast of mostly unknown actors do a convincing  and credible job in conveying the insane circumstances surrounding combat,  especially of the lonely, nerve-racking and suddenly murderous nature of  isolated units moving cautiously forward through the sometimes impenetrable  glades of the forest.All of the craziness and chaos of battle is well  presented, and the story line lends itself to the strong anti-war message  of the movie. A friend expressed outrage at the scene in which a platoon  leader shoots a deserting private, without realizing it is standard battle  procedure. There is nothing uplifting about the scenes and situations the  soldiers faced, no over-riding morality or contrived happy ending to  dislodge the reality of the horror and futility of all this carnage. If you  are looking for a pleasant evening of entertainment, a couple hours of  mindless diversion, better find another movie. But if you want to watch a  well-made and memorable movie that accurately recounts the events of one of  the most ill-conceived and bloodiest series of engagements and firefights  in the Allied campaign in France in the late Fall of 1944, and if you don't  mind a sobering slap of reality hitting you in the face while you're being  drawn into a thoughtful and engaging statement about life and death in the  20th century, this may be for you!

42607,A2YM0JQI2IO0VS,0783112750,"B. Berthold ""brad13""","[8, 9]","For a `war film` to achieve greatness it must first and foremost debunk any claim that war is anything but legitimized murder. There is nothing noble nor glorious about man`s most sadistic and perverse sport.  `When Trumpets Fade` captures this truth better than most war films.  While it lacks both the technical virtuosity of  `Saving Private Ryan` and the refinement of `Thin Red Line,` `When Trumpets Fade` manages to telegraph the `war experience` with a laudable fealty to that old chestnut,`war is hell.`WTF takes place in Germany`s Huertgen Forest during the fall of 1944.  Over the next three months, the Pennsylvania National Guard`s 28th `Keystone` division was ground down to near nothing in the so-called `Death Factory.`  The division`s continuous assault on the forest through withering artillery and tank fire was one of the greatest tactical blunders of American leadership during the war.  It`s no wonder that the long-suffering and valiant men of the 28th felt little motivation to sacrifice their lives under such incompetent leadership.Faulty leadership is precisely what this film exposes so accurately and so mercilessly.  Whether it be the Lt. Colonel (Dwight Yoakam), Lieutenant Pritchett (Martin Donovan) or the central character of Private David Manning (Ron Eldard), the leaders in this film are all case studies in gross self-interest.  Yoakam`s Lt. Colonel cares more about moving the front forward and thus advancing his career than the welfare of those under his command.  Lieutenant Pritchett is caught in the worst possible dilemma.  He has to produce results for the Colonel while protecting his men from futile sacrifice.The character of Private David Manning, masterfully portrayed by Ron Eldard, is what makes this film great.  With his admittedly self-serving common sense and open defiance of those in `authority,` Private Manning personifies the conundrum that was `GI Joe,` America`s vaunted citizen soldier.  Like so many Americans thrust from civilian life into the horrific slaughter of WWII, Manning`s `heroism` stems from his blunt refusal to be heroic.  His singular goal is to stay alive.  If survival entails saving other lives then all the better, but if not, then so be it.  This is a complete reversal of the Audie Murphy/Sgt York myth.  In the cauldron of war, saving yourself and your buddies is as noble as it gets.  And Private Manning does just that:  save himself and his men.Throughout the film, the viewer is forced to ask him/herself whether he/she would have acted differently than Private Manning.  The film opens with him carrying a mortally wounded comrade back to US lines.  When the soldier refuses to move on, thereby endangering them both, Manning is faced with an awful choice:  leave him to suffer until death or wait around until they are both picked off by sniper fire.  Instead, Manning chooses to hasten the inevitable.  Murder?  Mercy?  It`s precisely scenes such as these that make up the film`s emotional and moral complexity.Yet, in other scenes, Manning does what he can to save the lives of his platoon mates.  He consistently defies suicidal orders even under the threat of court martial. Yet, what makes Private Manning so real, so believable is that his every action is guided by simple self-preservation.  He`ll save lives but his comes first.  His credo is near universal.  ""I`ll do what I can to help you...but I`m not taking a bullet for anybody.""Despite its tiny budget, this HBO drama puts together a great cast.  While the film`s nexus is unquestionably Eldard`s Private Manning,  the supporting roles are strong as well.  Both Martin Donovan and Dwight Yoakam are very convincing as officers blinded by their respective positions.  Frank Whaley`s medic Chamberlain makes an excellent foil to Manning.  Unlike Manning, he believes everybody can and should be saved and confronts Manning on his seemingly arbitrary and self-motivated decisions.Not only are the performances and characters realistic in their complexity, but the film itself has more than its share of unsettling scenes.  While not as polished as SPR`s action scenes, the combat scenes in this film are all the more graphic and disturbing for being so understated.  Whether it be the severed body parts dangling from tree limbs, a soldier`s near melted face or a horrific jaw wound, `When Trumpets Fade` gives the viewer a tiny glimpse of the obscenity of combat.War films like war novels approach the pornographic.  To view or read in comfort that which for others was (is) a nightmarish reality is perverse and shameful.  That said, `When Trumpets Fade` brings the viewer to the battlefield and begs the question,"" What would you have done?""",5,An American Schweik,1277769600,"06 29, 2010",2010,4699,"['war', 'film', 'achieve', 'greatness', 'must', 'first', 'foremost', 'debunk', 'claim', 'war', 'anything', 'legitimized', 'murder', 'nothing', 'noble', 'glorious', 'man', 'most', 'sadistic', 'perverse', 'sport', 'When', 'Trumpets', 'Fade', 'captures', 'truth', 'better', 'most', 'war', 'films', 'technical', 'virtuosity', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'refinement', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'When', 'Trumpets', 'Fade', 'manages', 'telegraph', 'war', 'experience', 'laudable', 'fealty', 'old', 'chestnut', 'war', 'hell.', 'WTF', 'place', 'Germany', 's', 'Huertgen', 'Forest', 'fall', '1944', 'next', 'three', 'months', 'Pennsylvania', 'National', 'Guard', 's', '28th', 'Keystone', 'division', 'was', 'ground', 'down', 'nothing', 'so-called', 'Death', 'Factory.', 'division', 's', 'continuous', 'assault', 'forest', 'withering', 'artillery', 'tank', 'fire', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'tactical', 'blunders', 'American', 'leadership', 'war', 's', 'wonder', 'long-suffering', 'valiant', 'men', '28th', 'felt', 'little', 'motivation', 'sacrifice', 'lives', 'such', 'incompetent', 'leadership.Faulty', 'leadership', 'precisely', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'accurately', 'so', 'mercilessly', 'Whether', 'be', 'Lt', 'Colonel', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'Lieutenant', 'Pritchett', 'Martin', 'Donovan', 'central', 'character', 'Private', 'David', 'Manning', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'leaders', 'film', 'are', 'case', 'studies', 'gross', 'self-interest', 'Yoakam', 's', 'Lt', 'Colonel', 'more', 'moving', 'front', 'forward', 'thus', 'advancing', 'career', 'welfare', 'command', 'Lieutenant', 'Pritchett', 'caught', 'worst', 'possible', 'dilemma', 'produce', 'results', 'Colonel', 'protecting', 'men', 'futile', 'sacrifice.The', 'character', 'Private', 'David', 'Manning', 'masterfully', 'portrayed', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'what', 'film', 'great', 'admittedly', 'self-serving', 'common', 'sense', 'open', 'defiance', 'authority', 'Private', 'Manning', 'conundrum', 'was', 'GI', 'Joe', 'America', 's', 'vaunted', 'citizen', 'soldier', 'so', 'many', 'Americans', 'thrust', 'civilian', 'life', 'horrific', 'slaughter', 'WWII', 'Manning', 's', 'heroism', 'blunt', 'refusal', 'be', 'heroic', 'singular', 'goal', 'stay', 'alive', 'survival', 'entails', 'saving', 'other', 'lives', 'then', 'better', 'not', 'then', 'so', 'be', 'complete', 'reversal', 'Audie', 'Murphy/Sgt', 'York', 'myth', 'cauldron', 'war', 'saving', 'buddies', 'as', 'noble', 'Private', 'Manning', 'just', 'save', 'men.Throughout', 'film', 'viewer', 'forced', 'ask', 'he/she', 'would', 'have', 'acted', 'differently', 'Private', 'Manning', 'film', 'carrying', 'mortally', 'wounded', 'comrade', 'back', 'US', 'lines', 'When', 'soldier', 'move', 'thereby', 'endangering', 'Manning', 'faced', 'awful', 'choice', 'leave', 'suffer', 'death', 'wait', 'are', 'picked', 'off', 'sniper', 'fire', 'Instead', 'Manning', 'chooses', 'hasten', 'inevitable', 'Murder', 'Mercy', 's', 'precisely', 'scenes', 'such', 'make', 'up', 'film', 's', 'emotional', 'moral', 'complexity.Yet', 'other', 'scenes', 'Manning', 'what', 'can', 'save', 'lives', 'platoon', 'mates', 'consistently', 'suicidal', 'orders', 'even', 'threat', 'court', 'martial', 'what', 'Private', 'Manning', 'so', 'real', 'so', 'believable', 'action', 'guided', 'simple', 'self-preservation', 'll', 'save', 'lives', 'first', 'credo', 'universal', 'll', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'help', 'm', 'not', 'taking', 'bullet', 'anybody', 'tiny', 'budget', 'HBO', 'drama', 'together', 'great', 'cast', 'film', 's', 'nexus', 'unquestionably', 'Eldard', 's', 'Private', 'Manning', 'supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'strong', 'as', 'well', 'Martin', 'Donovan', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'are', 'very', 'convincing', 'officers', 'blinded', 'respective', 'positions', 'Frank', 'Whaley', 's', 'medic', 'Chamberlain', 'excellent', 'foil', 'Manning', 'Manning', 'everybody', 'can', 'should', 'be', 'saved', 'confronts', 'Manning', 'seemingly', 'arbitrary', 'self-motivated', 'decisions.Not', 'only', 'are', 'performances', 'characters', 'realistic', 'complexity', 'film', 'more', 'share', 'unsettling', 'scenes', 'not', 'as', 'polished', 'SPR', 's', 'action', 'scenes', 'combat', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'more', 'graphic', 'disturbing', 'being', 'so', 'understated', 'be', 'severed', 'body', 'parts', 'dangling', 'tree', 'limbs', 'soldier', 's', 'melted', 'face', 'horrific', 'jaw', 'wound', 'When', 'Trumpets', 'Fade', 'viewer', 'tiny', 'glimpse', 'obscenity', 'combat.War', 'films', 'war', 'novels', 'approach', 'pornographic', 'view', 'read', 'comfort', 'others', 'was', 'nightmarish', 'reality', 'perverse', 'shameful', 'said', 'When', 'Trumpets', 'Fade', 'viewer', 'battlefield', 'begs', 'question', 'What', 'would', 'have', 'done']",When Trumpets Fade VHS
42608,A2SZ86FLBMZPLL,0783112750,"B. Etnyre ""roguemissive""","[8, 9]","For me and many (if not most) other film enthusiasts, a film's story and plot - rather than the inclusion of ""A List"" actors (an arbitrary, usually temporary, and essentially meaningless designation) to its cast - is the initial draw (plus a good trailer doesn't hurt); as for rental movies, the reasons can be less geared towards the plot and more geared towards the wondrous aesthetic of bare female skin.  In the World War 2 film WHEN TRUMPETS FADE, viewers get none of the latter aspect but a very commendable example of the former.  It is an excellent story and screenplay with an engagingly ironic premise and an effective cast.  The setting is the Hurtgen Forest, a short distance from the Belgian/German border.  The battle over said real estate was a harrowing and bloody ordeal that inflicted significant casualties on the American troops, who expected a cakewalk following the ongoing German retreat in the wake of the allied liberation of France.  Instead, the allies found the weary German troops consolidated in well-planned defensive positions from which they put forth determined and brutally effective resistance.  The film actually closely follows the details of the battle (one of the longest in U.S. history).In the movie, Ron Eldard stars as David Manning, the lone survivor of his platoon returning to the battalion HQ after a devastating battle and a harrowing incident which followed.  Instead of a brief respite from the horrendous ordeal, Manning is not only put back into combat rotation, but is also assigned as a squad leader.  Manning himself is an underachieving fatalistic malcontent without much interest or effort beyond his own self-preservation.  The Company Commander (in an understated but not entirely ineffective portrayal by Martin Donovan) has no illusions about Manning's character, but comes to recognize an unappealing yet practical truth: that Manning's experience (especially when compared to the inexperienced replacements who reinforce the mauled units) and his ability to survive are tantamount to making him the best candidate for the position (if for no other reason than by default).  Manning continually asks for an exception from combat duty, which is always and immediately refused.  Soon, he is assigned a squad to lead, which is reduced to a mere fire team after an unsuccessful attack by the battalion is savagely repelled by German artillery.  Following this latest debacle, the Captain makes Manning a somewhat remarkable deal: if Manning will lead his 4-man fire team on a seemingly hopeless assault to destroy the German artillery positions, the Company Commander will classify Manning as unfit for combat via a Section 8.Thus, what begins with a suicide mission which the Captain believes will rid him of Manning and the requests for removal from combat duty, spurs an increasing cycle of surprisingly heroic though self-serving actions by Manning that grow in daring and peril.  Along the way in his Faustian bargain, Manning unintentionally displays the leadership, bravery, and heroism that he had no interest in possessing, even if the motives lack nobility.  It is an intriguing question of the nature of heroism: is its essence defined by motive without regards to results, or actions without regard to motive?  As for the characters, there aren't many that are very easy to like in a conventional sense, though you end up rooting for some of them.  Besides Manning's self-centeredness and disdain for authority, the Captain is an earnest but ineffectual commander, the new and unprepared (both in terms of training and psychology) platoon leader (Timothy Oliphant) utterly loses his nerve and mind after a disastrous attack, the Battalion Commander (marginal performance by Dwight Yoakum) is a rear echelon officer who reflects the upper chain-of-command's oblivion to the tactical realities of the battle.  Eldard may not be the greatest actor ever born, but he nails the role and comes off as rather believable - which is or should be the goal of an actor in a film.  Frank Whaley, Dylan Bruno, and Zak Orth all turn in solid performances respectively as a dedicated medic, a tough but jaded sergeant, and the brand new augmentee who transforms from being the platoon's biggest doofus to its most promising soldier through his harrowing experiences.For fans of war movies, the budget is pretty modest (an HBO movie filmed in eastern Europe) with special effects and military props which might not be top of the line as well.  But the violence and gore are frankly depicted, and the terror and tension are palpable (this is the movie which prepared me for the unprecedentedly violent Omaha Beach landing sequence in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN).  There isn't much in the way of soppy sentimentality, though there is an argument that could be made for this film being one of the most realistic and best World War 2 films you never saw.  It is one of my favorite films of all, though this gritty and dark effort doesn't fall into the category of ""feel good movies"".  It's best to be in the right frame of mood for seeing it, though worth the time spent.",5,It might be one of the most underrated war movies you never saw,1183680000,"07 6, 2007",2007,5115,"['many',

The  primary consideration among the troops that &quot;nobody dies&quot; is  brought home with sheer realism. The entire cast performed brilliantly and  the directing is top notch. Unlike &quot;The Longest Day&quot; where the  viewer is merely a spectataor to the events of war, or &quot;Saving Pvt.  Ryan&quot; where he feels to be an occasional particiapnt, this movie hits  you where its at. You're down there with the squad feeling the danger and  tension of fighting and the fear of getting killed . There is a lot of  action and excitement in this movie despite the fact that it also a  cerebral cinema.

My Uncle Phil especially as he had fought in Africa, Italy, (Normandy Beach and The Battle of the Bulge) France, and Germany. This movie will make you feel a new respect for what many of the men in that war went through at one place or another or one time or another. This one battle made men reach down deep to give their inner strength to those around them. I have never been in the military but in my work and personal life I have been exposed to them all my life.

Some may object to its rather unpatriotic overtones (especially in the context of WWII), but I suppose in the meatgrinder that was the Hurtgen Forest anyone's patriotism would be severely put to the test.  But it's not the film's political message that I object to, but its execution.  Although most of the cast turned in solid, believable performances, the script and the direction were generally uneven.The film started off well enough.  A rather reluctant and unheroic private, the lone survivor of his platoon, was assigned to lead a squad of raw ""replacements"" into their position.  An unexceptional quiet day on the front perhaps, but the nervous tension was palpable as we follow our group of raw troops through the drifting fog and the errie quiet of the forest as they crawl their way to their foxholes.  Nothing dramatic, nothing spectacular, just the dripping terror of being alone in the woods faced with an unseen enemy.But if the film was masterful in depicting the psychological tension before the battle, the battle itself was anti-climatic.  In no way can this film be compared to the gritty realism of Saving Private Ryan.  There was a great deal of gore to be sure, but the battle sequences seem plucked straight out of a Clint Eastwood First Person Shooter, as troops from the 1st German Deaf, Blind & Dumb Division flail about in utter incompetency as our squad of half a dozen raw recruits take out one position after another.  I won't even mention the scenerios that seem highly improbable to anyone even vaguely knowledgeable about military history.If you want to see a film that successfully combines the gritty realism of WWII combat with an anti-war message, I recommend the Thin Red Line.",3,"Strong start, weak finish.

The focus is the bloody and all-but-forgotten fight over Germany's Hurtegen Forest, described in the soldiers in the film as ""the Death Factory.""  Our hero is a self-serving survivor whose talent for combat leads to several unwanted battlefield promotions -- and, of course, to a restoration of his deadened sense of humanity and heroism.  The forced modernism of the script -- particularly the gratuitous cursing and '90s-ish performances -- threaten to upend the film in the opening sequences, but it gathers steam and a sense of dread.  Worth checking out.  The only real gaping hole is country singer Dwight Yoakam's dull, scenery-chomping cameos as a bullet-headed, unsympathetic officer.

42623,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,0783112750,Doug Park,"[1, 1]","{4.25 stars}WHEN TRUMPETS FADE is one of the very best recent WWII films. It doesn't have anywhere near the scope of something likeSaving Private Ryan, but it captures what it was like to fight as a typical ""grunt"" in Europe during the winter of '44-'45--and what it's like to fight in a war anywhere-- about as well as any movie can. Appropriately enough, its setting is the bloody, intense Battle of H&uuml;rtgen Forest, the longest single engagement in the history of the United States Army and one that, ironically, many of the history books largely ignore and that most experts argue should have been avoided altogether.Ron Eldard gives a really fine performance as ""Manning,"" a reluctant draftee-type who's ""not about to take a bullet for anyone."" One of the best aspects of this film is the way it shows the psychology--and irony--of how Manning's higher-ups use him via a combination of threats, flattery, and promotions just to take one small strategic spot during the battle. Just about everyone else in the film--American or German, I don't believe that there are any non-military characters --gives a commendably believable performance, but special mention goes to Zak Orth, who plays a typical replacement who, young, green, and unsoldierly though he may seem, turns out to be a fine soldier, and Martin Donovan as Captain Pritchett, a typically ruthless, uncaring commander to the men in his company but a bit of a Private Manning himself to his own superiors.Like most of today's war films, WHEN TRUMPETS FADE is gory, disturbing, and, by necessity (since it's about an unpopular and rather ineffectual battle), somewhat depressing.

It was really ominous and suspenseful. But the thing I really didn't like  about it were the blatant technical inaccuracies.When the company made  their push through the minefield, it was infuriating to see them so bunched  up. Groups of 3 here, 5 there, and 7 over there. Each man should have had  at least 20 to 25 meters between him and his buddy. AT LEAST!I've spent  the better part of my life studying weapons and tactics and how they are  employed in the field, so when I see a BAR firing about 100 rounds without  the man behind it changing magazines, it pisses me off. Or when every time  an enemy soldier gets hit, he lurches around for a couple seconds and then  finally screams or says, &quot;Ahh!&quot;.When a burning hot hunk of  lead smashes into you, you fall to the ground like a ton of bricks. It's  like you don't have legs anymore. That's it; you're down. End of story.  Call for a corpsman if you can, but more than likely, it'll be somebody  else yelling, &quot;Corpsman up!&quot;. I know that in the army, the  majority call for a Medic, but I'm speaking for a different branch. That's  what geting shot is like.And the fat guy wasting nearly all of his fuel  in the flamethrower, just screaming, screaming, screaming. It's  ludicrous.Also, why in the hell do movie makers feel they have to create  huge fireballs to make an artillery blast look real?Artillery doesn't do  that. The movie kept on showing 88mm shells hitting the trees, which, yes  it did happen, but then for some reason, billowing fireballs would eminate  from the ground. Artillery sends a lot of dirt and dust in the air along  with a hell of a lot of fast-flying shrapnel. There almost no flame at all.  It just annoys me, that's all.I would recommend against adding this  movie to your collection.

Over 24,000 young men and boys were either killed or wounded in this battle.  This fine film portrays the soldiers in an American platoon during this bloody battle.Ron Eldard's performance as David Manning, a young, scared, and &quot;yellow&quot; private-promoted to seargeant-promoted to lieutenant is excellent. Manning was the sole survivor of his original platoon and was assigned the task of forming a group of replacement G.I. s into a fighting unit.  Accused of being &quot;yellow&quot; by some of his peers, Manning molds his platoon into an effective fighting unit as the film goes on, and they participate in some daring raids behind enemy lines.Frank Whaley, Martin Donovan, and Dwight Yoakam give fine performances as a medic, company captain, and group commander.The action scenes are well-done, especially the attack by Manning's group on a battery of German 88mm anti-tank guns.  The setting is eerily similiar to the real Hurtgen, with its dense trees and misty fog.  This made the movie very realistic.  The only scene which I thought was a little &quot;theatrical&quot; was the bazooka attack on the German tanks.  German tanks were well known for their thick armor, but in this scene, the American bazookas knocked out the tanks with one shot.  Sometimes it took several shots from a bazooka before the tank was actually destroyed.Overall, I rate this as a good film.  The acting is very good and the scenery is excellent.

Austra,"[6, 13]","WHEN TRUMPETS FADE starts off great, but then devolves into something little better than paperback fiction.This is really the first film to take on the often forgotten Battle of the Huertgen forest.  In that, I applaud director John Irvin.  The storyline is a grim.  Private Manning discovers that he is the sole survivor of his squad.  As other noncomms and officers become casualties, Manning finds himself rapidly promoted -- against his will.  As a newly promoted sergeant, Manning is assigned a group of replacements and his own selfish survivalist attitude is sidelined in order for him to teach the new arrivals.No doubt about it.  In this movie does a good job introducing the death factory of the Huertgen and recreating the partially overrun fortifications of the German Westwall.Unfortunately, the film derails from historic reality with the renewed attacks on the Kall Gorge.  The entire Kall River Bridge fight is as phony as the bridge battle scenes in THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY.  After a promising start, it appears that no one on the production staff bothered to read up on what actually happened on the narrow Kall trail and the struggles on either side of the gorge.  The true story alone would have made for a good movie.One of the best books written on the Huertgen Forest is FOLLOW ME AND DIE by Cecil B. Currey.  Having previously read that book and several others, as well has having had the good fortune to tour the actual Huertgen battlefield, I am bound to be more critical than most of this film. At a time before I had cable HBO a co-worker told me that this film was very good.  Unfortunately I had to wait a couple years before it was available on VHS (and now DVD).  As I watched the film for the first time I kept hoping the movie would redeem itself before the end credits.  Alas, it was not to be.In the film, despite the fact that the US Army cannot come close to breaking though the German lines, Manning's green squad continuously does so and wreaks havoc with the Germans.There are some good fight scenes, but please do not confuse this nighmarish fantasy with what really happened along the Westwall in late 1944.  Come on, now.  American officers would not blow whistles to signal an attack.  Why not just invite a German artillery barrage?The movie was filmed in Hungary, no doubt to acquire military hardware and extras at a bargain.  This movie would have had potential had someone taken the opportunity to read a book on the subject.  As such, the battle in the Huertgen is just as distorted as the many Battle of the Bulge movies gone awry. I came away from this film thinking that it was Irvin's remake of HAMBURGER HILL by inserting 1944 Europe.Buy this movie as military fiction.  Some fine moments.

Although the actual story itself is fictional it is couched in the reality that was an actual battle during World War II that is known as the Battle of the Hurtgen Forest which took place in the autumn of 1944 and was immediately overshadowed by the much larger and incredibly more significant Battle of the Bulge which took place only a few days later.  Albeit fictional, this is an incredibly well told and poignant &quot;soldier's&quot; story that rings amazingly of the human condition in impossible situations that are well beyond the daily lives of the normal American.Ron Eldard, primarily of &quot;ER&quot; fame and several other television programs performs quite admirably in the lead role of this film, the producers chose very well in picking him for this part.  Of note also are the great performances by Dwight Yoakam, Martin Donovan and Frank Whaley.Director John Irvin who also directed &quot;Hamburger Hill&quot; and &quot;The Dogs of War&quot; clearly knows what it is to put a war film to screen and tell the soldiers story to the fullest.  He clearly deserves any and all accolades he's received for making this film.The Premise:&quot;When Trumpets Fade&quot; is the fictional albeit extremely well told story of the Battle of the Hurtgen Forest and more succinctly one soldier, Private Manning (Ron Eldard) who, through his own innate understanding of battlefield condition was able to survive his units initial onslaught and defeat in the forest.

42635,A2AVSKPLMDEBJT,0783112750,"LILyte Review ""Mercy""","[1, 18]","This is a good movie on the battle lines of Hurtgen Forest,  which it's very realistic in blood galore. I am not sure of the accuracy when compare to factual history but if they really depict what actually happen, then i can understand the waste of lives with lil gain during this frontiere. First off, when this sargient non-wannabe agreed do take out the enemy guns in return for a section 8, why did he bring 4 rookies GI's with 2 of them carrying their own flamethrower. First off, flamethrowers are for close range and not use to take out artillary in open field unless they want to be blown up with it when all the artillary shell start to explode. Not only that, they don't even know how to use it. One ran away sceaaming like a whining baby who eventually got shot by his own man and the other one is yelling like a moron while charging at them. Then they run like babies back to the line, which cost the lives of 3 of them.First off, i would forget about the framethrowers and bring a bazooka with lots of granades, one guy bring the rockets. Plus,  everyone forgot about those M1 rifles and bring thompsons instead to cover more ground. Dwight Yoakim, ur ok as a worthless commander but don't give up ur singing career cuz u still can't act and never will. Also, how can anyone suppose to get past the landmines and barb wires during heavy artilery shelling in daylight?  The 82nd is a good division and should'nt waste their time in this mess. They should join the 101st in the battle of the bulge, which has a purpose and a victory. The keystone 28th division should just stay there holding the siegfred line instead of pushing an offensive to break it.I recommend anyone who enjoy war movies, to watch this.",4,Hiyo Silver type of manslaughter that never should've been,1042329600,"01 12, 2003",2003,1720,"['good', 'movie', 'battle', 'lines', 'Hurtgen', 'Forest', 'very', 'realistic', 'blood', 'galore', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'accuracy', 'when', 'compare', 'factual', 'history', 'really', 'depict', 'what', 'actually', 'happen', 'then', 'i', 'can', 'understand', 'waste', 'lives', 'lil', 'gain', 'frontiere', 'First', 'off', 'when', 'sargient', 'non-wannabe', 'agreed', 'do', 'take', 'out', 'enemy', 'guns', 'return', 'section', '8', 'why', 'did', 'bring', '4', 'rookies', 'GI', '2', 'carrying', 'own', 'flamethrower', 'First', 'flamethrowers', 'are', 'close', 'range', 'not', 'use', 'take', 'out', 'artillary', 'open', 'field', 'want', 'be', 'blown', 'up', 'when', 'artillary', 'shell', 'start', 'explode', 'Not', 'only', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'how', 'use', 'One', 'ran', 'away', 'sceaaming', 'whining', 'baby', 'who', 'eventually', 'got', 'shot', 'own', 'man', 'other', 'one', 'yelling', 'moron', 'charging', 'Then', 'run', 'babies', 'back', 'line', 'cost', 'lives', '3', 'them.First', 'i', 'would', 'forget', 'framethrowers', 'bring', 'bazooka', 'lots', 'granades', 'one', 'guy', 'bring', 'rockets', 'everyone', 'forgot', 'M1', 'rifles', 'bring', 'thompsons', 'instead', 'cover', 'more', 'ground', 'Dwight', 'Yoakim', 'ur', 'ok', 'worthless', 'commander', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'ur', 'singing', 'career', 'cuz', 'u', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'never', 'will', 'Also', 'how', 'can', 'anyone', 'suppose', 'get', 'landmines', 'barb', 'wires', 'heavy', 'artilery', 'shelling', 'daylight', '82nd', 'good', 'division', ""should'nt"", 'waste', 'time', 'mess', 'should', 'join', '101st', 'battle', 'bulge', 'purpose', 'victory', 'keystone', '28th', 'division', 'should', 'just', 'stay', 'there', 'holding', 'siegfred', 'line', 'instead', 'pushing', 'offensive', 'break', 'it.I', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'enjoy', 'war', 'movies', 'watch']",When Trumpets Fade VHS

42637,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,0783112750,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[3, 3]","This very little known film took me completely by surprise and it was a very pleasant surprise indeed. Now, don't get me wrong, this film is quite nightmarish and extremely violent and I do not think there is even one single ""pleasant"" moment in it - but on another hand this is a rarity in recent cinema, a war film with a solid scenario, credible characters, well filmed action scenes, quite a lot of developments we can not anticipate and a really surprising, very strong ending...Director John Irvin made earlier (in 1987) another excellent (and also little known) war film, ""Hamburger Hill"". In this one he did almost as well. As for ""Hamburger Hill"" he selected actors who are not really known (well, at least I didn't know them) and he worked them very hard indeed - in the film we can almost REALLY see the terminal exhaustion slowly breaking people who just reached the very limit of their strangth... As in ""Hamburger Hill"", the cast is exclusively male, the language is strong and the occasional jokes fly at the lowest possible level... However the butcher bill in this film is much, much heavier than in ""Hamburger Hill"" as here, the enemy has not only light weapons but also artillery and tanks.Most of this movie was turned in a natural park in Hungary and the forest is indeed a very savage place, with enough fog and undergrowth to hide entire squads waiting in ambush, and enough steep hills and muddy banked rivers to stop in its tracks any amount of armor - which is exactly what happened in 1944-45 in the Hurtgen Forest and what made this battle so bloody for both sides. With only a handful of tanks managing to slip here or there and the positions of both sides being so close (sometimes only 25 metres separated Americans from Germans!) that air support was ruled out, the battle had to be waged as in 1914-17, with infantry and artillery... And the results were exactly the same as during the WWI - a long, exhausting, overextended slaughter.Military details were well respected. On both sides soldiers carry weapons they really carried in 1944-45 - Garands, Thompsons and Browning BARs for Americans and Mauser 98, MP40 and MG42 for Germans. Hungarian army also helped with some of its hardware and as the result old Soviet M1939 85 mm anti-aircraft guns played in this film very convincingly the legendary German ""acht-acht"" (88 mm) anti-aircraft guns, which also happened to be one of the best antitank and infantry support weapons of World War II... Also, at one moment we can see a pair of Soviet-made self-propelled 2S1Gvozdika howitzers - once fitted with ""schurzen"" (thin lateral armor plates), additionnal turret armor and some camouflage nets, they can pass for the last variants of Panzer-IV which in 1944-45 would indeed wear quite a lot of additionnal armor and camouflage...The scenario is not stupid at all and the ending is particularly strong. It is also a very good thing that although everybody curses and bitches all the time against the ""stupid army"", there is virtually no villain amongst the officers. It is true that the lieutenant-colonel and the captain seem to be extremely ruthless - but they are just doing their job and we realize soon enough that if they show any weakness their whole batallion will collapse and run... There is also one of the officers who ultimately will loose it because of being repeatedly shell shocked, but even then we can hardly see him as a villain... In fact in the whole film there is no villains or heroes - everybody is trapped in this seemingly neverending battle...So, to conclude, this is a very, very good war film, which keeps a high quality of scenario and action from the beginning to the end. I am very happy that I discovered it and I am certain that any war films fan will be delighted after watching it.

42638,A1VID7V2TWV3AE,0783112750,"M. Dalton ""big-dummy""","[33, 36]","This is a coldly realistic, well executed though somewhat low budget movie (I think originally done for HBO).  Some people complain about technical points, but they are wrong.  The technical realism in here is superb.One point worth correcting, re: bazookas vs German tanks.  The StuGG 3 and PZ IV tanks depicted in the film WERE succeptible to US Bazookas, especially the versions available in 1944.  What's more, in the scene where they are attacked, they are hit from behind.  Almost every Tank in the world at that time (except maybe a Tiger) was vulnerable to a hit from behind.And unlike in most WW II movies, the tanks in here looked very, very real.  They were not round turreted US M48's or even russian T-34s, but rather very realistic looking mockups which looked almost exactly like real PV IV's.  The German cannon (not heavy artillery as another reivewer mistakenly referred to them) were equally realistic and terrifying on impact.  It was also refreshing to see (unlike SPR) that they made good use of their Mg42 bow and co-ax guns against US infantry.  Tanks are scary, scary things, and that is how they were depicted here.In fact the SOUND and effect of the shells impacting was the most real I have ever seen in any movie.  It was one of the only times I have ever seen shell explosions that brought to mind the real thing.Some people wont like the fact that not all the U.S. troops are portryaed as cliche heros, willing to jump on a grenade to save their buddies.  These people have obviously never been in the military.The military is full of ordinary people, (especially during a time of draft) There is the same proportion of true heros as in real life, that is to say, very few.  Under good leadership and the right circumstances, a good esprit de corps can develop where many more rise to the occasion.  The Battle of the Hurtgen, while it had it's share of heroes on both sides, was not one of these occasions.  It was a slaughter of US troops in which morale reached the breaking point (the only US deserter shot in the war, Eddie Slovak, fled from this battle).  Read some of the actual accounts (widely available online, google Hurtgen forst) and you can easily grasp the horror and futility of this immense battle.Dont like the idea of Ron Eldards character looking out for number one (at least some of the time)?  Or the incompetent, detatched senior officers who had no imagination or idea what to do other than send troops into the meat grinder over and over?Well, stick your head in the sand like an Ostrich, because that is how war is sometimes.  Try to imagine yourself facing near certain death in an obviously bungled military operation, with idiots in charge, seemingly determined to feed you to the lions.I found the technical realism and detail superb, the acting was goood, and the writing was excellent.  I think it hits home more if you have ever been in the military.  Yes, it was 1944, but people cursed then too. People could be just as cynical as today, especially people on the front lines. Trust me.  When do you think terms like SNAFU and FUBAR were coined?  The scenery (shot in Eastern Europe) reminded me of the sinister Black Forest in Bavaria where I was stationed in the Army.The German soldiers were a good combination of scary veterans and hapless draftees, not just the creepy losers as in SPR.  The U.S. replacements were very accurately depicted, and their transformation from innocence to desperation, as the realization of the true horror of their circumstances dawns on them, is a true testimetn to war.If you liked this directors other films, such as the underrated Hamburger Hill, you will like this.

G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[124, 137]","If you watch films about WWII, and maybe even if you haven't, you've seen ""Saving Private Ryan"" which has apparently become the definitive movie about The Big One....well, if that film as a polar opposite, this is it. ""Trumpets"" follows a few days in the miserable life of a miserable man, Private Manning, a dogface who is part of the ... disasterous 1944 - 1945 campaign by the American army to seize the Huertgen Forest from the Wehrmacht. Everybody knows about D-Day and the Bulge, while the Huertgen is forgotten, probably because there is no glory in recounting the story of how 30,000 GI's got fed into a human meatgrinder they called ""The Death Factory"" for no purpose. The Germans never could understand why the American army chose to attack them at their strongest, most easily defensible point, but were more than content to let it happen. WWII histories, most notably Eisenhower's and Bradley's, who oversaw this idiocy, gloss it over, but ""Trumpets"" rips open the scab and gives a glimpse of what really went down. Unlike ""Ryan"" which stressed the nobility of the individual soldier even as it attacked the logic of war, ""Trumpets"" has no heroes. Private Manning is a no-account malingerer who doesn't give a damn about anyone but himself and as a result, keeps surviving while better men get killed off. His officers foolishly assume he is therefore a good soldier, and keep promoting him against his will. Thus he ends up having to break in the replacements soldiers being fed into the grinder, a task which requires empathy, leadership, courage, and patience, so naturally Manning is the worst possible choice. The battle scenes are not especially terrific, but the film does a good job of showing how the stress of combat can make good man bad and bad men worse. Officers lose their nerve, privates run away, everybody is cold, tired, and afraid, and there is always one more mindless ""push"" into the impregnable defence just over the horizon. The performances, especially by Robert Eldard as Manning and Frank Whaley as his only (sort of) friend, a combat medic, are very good. The film never sentimentalizes the characters, and the scene where Manning brutally tells the basket-case lieutenant ""If there's any way I can help you without endangering my own life, I won't hesitate, but I'm not taking a bullet for anybody"" is about as far from Tom Hanks' speech at the end of ""Ryan"" as you are gonna get. The lieutenant, near tears, tells him that's not good enough, whereupon Manning says, ""That's as good as it gets."" The medic overhears this and tells him, ""When you're out there with your guts shot out crying for a medic -- if there's any way I can help you without endangering my own life, I won't hesitate.""

This is one of those episodes that doesn't find frequent mention in the history books, but strangely it wound up with its own movie.When I watched this, I couldn't help being reminded of the Vietnam flick ""Platoon.""  The emphasis here is on showing the gritty, unglamorous side of infantry combat, and it's well done.  Heroism, cowardice, mud, blood and fratricide are all featured in this story of a scared G.I. who's determined to survive the war at any cost, even if it means the loss of his honor.The story opens with a young private, brand new to the war, who is the sole survivor after his platoon attacks a German position and is wiped out.  His survival is qualification enough to earn him a promotion to sergeant, and not long after, to lieutenant.  He wants neither.  All he wants to do is survive at any cost, and he doesn't care what his superiors or subordinates think about it.The action scenes are generally believable and well done, even if some of the mock-ups of the German tanks aren't.  Several of the scenes are particularly intense and bloody, a little reminiscent of Private Ryan, but not to the same degree of utter carnage.  In general I thought the acting was okay, but seeing Dwight Yoakam as a light colonel was a little surreal for me.

42648,APHX2A37KDRAH,0783112750,N. Trachta,"[5, 6]","I picked this movie up years ago because it dealt with something I've had an interest in; the battles that took place in the Hurtgen Forest.  My fascination with the Hurtgen Forest derives from the absoluteness of the conditions and how men continued their struggles in a battle that never should have taken place.  Rather than the mobile warfare so typified in other WWII battles, the battles in the Hurtgen Forest were typified by relatively static warfare in terrible terrain that was reminiscent of the Civil War struggle in the Wilderness.Rating wise this ones a solid 4 star movie.  The acting is solid, especially given how young/green the actors were.  All of the actors did an excellent job capturing the behavior and look of the troops who'd fought in the Hurtgen Forest (especially around 7 November 1944 when the movie takes places).  The terrain is between accurate and very accurate depending on the parts you're looking for (the woods and the mud are very accurate; the bridge over the Kall stream and the terrain around the Kall trail were inaccurate).  Historically the director and the writers did a good job telling of the 112th Infantry Regiment, 28th ID (the 112th was the regiment from the 28th ID assigned to capture Schmidt and Kommerscheidt) and showing the losses the division sustained (the Hurtgen Forest were nicknamed the Death Factory by American troops.  I've read of American losses being between 24,000 and 30,000 with German losses being similar.  Matter of fact, one battalion went in with 900 men, received 100 reinforcements, and walked out with 50 men of whom half were sent to hospital).  The weak point in the movie was showing the area around the Kall Trail and showing them attacking the guns (sorry, they would have been the responsibility of another battalion or the 109th Regiment).  This is significant because viewer not familiar with the battlefield could be mislead about conditions (having said that though, they did a great job showing what the battlefield conditions were like though).  I recommend this one for lovers of history or those interested in seeing the realities of what war is like.

42649,A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z,0783112750,Octavius,"[19, 37]","A movie about the battle of Hurtigen Forrest in the closing year of WWII. A battle left in obscurity because it represented America's highest attrition in any battle during WWII and clearly the poorest leadership. A lofty subject the execution of which was mutilated by inummerable basic errors in tactical details and equipment. The quality of the film is eroded further by a simplistic and inaccurate script, substandard directing, and mediocre acting.The script is flawed in that the language and even the situations are purely modern anachronisms so that the characters end up talking and behaving as if they were in Vietnam at Hue 24 years later.  The tactical decisions each enlisted and officer makes in the film are laughable.  The characters portrayed are so inept that they must have been in a coma during basic training.  For some absurd reason, it seems like every GI in that film feels compelled to come out of his fox hole and talk to his buddies without care while being shelled or in full battle; as if having a pleasant walk in the park. Ask any vet, unless ordered to do so or a fellow soldier is injured, no soldier in his right mind would do something like that when being bombarded by artillery.  At one point some guys pick up a flame thrower that uses a fire hose (a fire hose????) to shoot the flame! The Germans in a tactical retreat withdraw the 88s back last after the infantry so that they remain exposed to the advancing enemy?  And it just went on.  I had to stop the film after a while because I was laughing too hard.  The only thing those involved in producing and directing this film knew about their story is that it was during WWII in Europe and that the Japanese were not there.Ultimate conclusion, this has to be one of the absolute worst war films I have ever seen and I have seen many. I've seen bad foreign war films that are better than this HBO film.  Hands down, this has to be the worst HBO film I have seen in a long time.  Don't be fooled by all the stars the film has. I frankly don't know why so many reviewers rate this film over two stars!  Rent the movie first if you're thinking about buying it so that you will only have lost $5 instead of $20 in watching this ridiculous film.  I originally received this movie as a promotional item; I watched it once and gave it away in disgust. One star is too kind a rating for such an amateurish film.

It was bad, but not on that scale statistically! German-plaques aside, if you start checking, I think youll find Im 'rechts'.But you are correct this battle is deliberately played-down in Hollywood compared to the still relatively huge US death-toll, and relatively huge US bungling and callousness, of legends like Bradley who had a tank named after him.This film addresses that, and this battle should have been looked-at in non-flag-flapping terms previously, it is classic-grounds for the anti-war genre.

42652,AZYDWA8MSNUMR,0783112750,Patrick King,"[274, 280]","This movie focuses on a sad chapter in the history of the U.S Army in World War II.  The Hurtgen Forest was a deathtrap the could have more or less been bypassed.  Certainly a low point in the annals of command, though  through no fault of the G.I.s involved.  This movie made a point to bring  out the frustration and waste experienced by the men of the 28th Inf. Div.  in that campaign.  I think Spielberg set a new standard for the war movie  genre with Saving Private Ryan.  So far, When Trumpets Fade is one of the  few recent military movies to even come close to that standard. It's a  shame that, being a made for cable release, it hasn't been seen by more  people.  The movie is technically very well done.  Uniform and equipment  portrayal is excellent.  For those reviewers above who find fault with a  G.I. wearing his watch cap backwards, try wearing one under an M-1 helmet  sometime. It's more comfy turned backwards I assure you.  The only thing  the movie couldn't represent, being filmed in Hungary, was the true  geography of the Kall River Valley, which is much worse than shown on the  film.  Having hiked the Kall Trail quite a bit, it's a rough walk.  Hats  off as well to my fellow US military members, stationed in Hungary, that  played extras in the film.

Their mission is to break through the German lines around a bridge guarded by two 88mm FlaK guns and 2 PzIV H/J tanks.  To prevent the main assualt force from getting decimated, our unlikely hero takes a small squad on a flanking manuever to take out the 88's and tanks.

While not as graphic as Ryan, this movie conveys just as much horror.  The equippment appears accurate for the Germans as well as US forces shown.  The two German tanks even if not the real thing have been done up to look like it.  That gets points from me.  The end, while a little fantastic, is still plausible for the most part.
