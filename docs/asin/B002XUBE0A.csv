As far as indie flicks go, I'll give it a 5. It is pretty impressive for an indie flick. The rivalry between the born and raised Harlemites and the Slumlord is interesting and one of my favorite themes throughout the movie. The music selections are dope too and put a great finishing touch on the film.",5,Not Too Shabby....,1266364800,"02 17, 2010",2010,406,"['recently', 'had', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'film', 'Two', 'Stick', 'Up', 'Kids', 'agree', 'review', 'above', 'As', 'far', 'indie', 'flicks', 'go', ""'ll"", 'give', '5', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'indie', 'flick', 'rivalry', 'born', 'raised', 'Harlemites', 'Slumlord', 'interesting', 'one', 'favorite', 'themes', 'movie', 'music', 'selections', 'are', 'dope', 'too', 'put', 'great', 'finishing', 'touch', 'film']",Stick Up Kids

I thought this would be just another NYC crime flick but they tackle some real issues that New Yorkers are experiencing in several of the newly gentrified neighborhoods. This movie also taught me some stuff I didnt know about New York City's first settlers (hint: it was not the dutch). Bryce Wilson and Mel Jackson are great on the screen. I would give 5 stars except for a couple scenes that are a little too corny, other wise a great flick!",4,More than what it seems!,1265932800,"02 12, 2010",2010,467,"['film', 'impressed', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'NYC', 'crime', 'flick', 'tackle', 'real', 'issues', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'are', 'experiencing', 'several', 'newly', 'gentrified', 'neighborhoods', 'movie', 'also', 'taught', 'stuff', 'didnt', 'know', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'first', 'settlers', 'hint', 'was', 'not', 'dutch', 'Bryce', 'Wilson', 'Mel', 'Jackson', 'are', 'great', 'screen', 'would', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'couple', 'scenes', 'are', 'little', 'too', 'corny', 'other', 'wise', 'great', 'flick']",Stick Up Kids
1298796,A1NLO4JVLEGGRJ,B002XUBE0A,New York Horror Reader,"[1, 1]","..I'm going to keep this short and sweet.  This is a horribly written story about a group of con artist / thieves called the 'Stick up Kids'.  The script throws every b movie cliche at you, and the bulk of the actors and actresses involved really seem like they are just phoning it in.  The lead male actor has horrible timing and can't deliver a line to save his life.  The lighting sound and editing where pretty good for a low budget movie...but it's just not enough.I can understand what the other reviewers are saying when they mention that its a black cast..and that at least they get a chance to shine..but the message in this movie is the not a good one.  The theme of the story is that if you are a thief a lier and a con man who breaks the law on a daily basis, and is a general detriment to society..it's okay if as long as you give back to the community.  This is the same ridiculous message in allot of today's modern rap music.  There is a culture of respect for criminality in the African American community that should be eliminated, not celebrated.  This movie is not only not a good movie....it sends a horrible message.  If African American actors and actresses get a chance to create something they owe it to their community to be socially responsible with the message they are sending....or don't try to send a message at all..just make a good movie..I threw this DVD out after one viewing....save your money",2,A ridiculous story that was horribly acted,1284595200,"09 16, 2010",2010,1429,"['..I', ""'m"", 'going', 'keep', 'short', 'sweet', 'horribly', 'written', 'story', 'group', 'con', 'artist', '/', 'called', ""'Stick"", 'up', 'Kids', 'script', 'b', 'movie', 'cliche', 'bulk', 'actors', 'actresses', 'involved', 'really', 'seem', 'are', 'just', 'phoning', 'lead', 'male', 'actor', 'horrible', 'timing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'line', 'save', 'life', 'lighting', 'sound', 'editing', 'where', 'pretty', 'good', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'enough.I', 'can', 'understand', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'are', 'saying', 'when', 'mention', 'black', 'cast..and', 'least', 'get', 'chance', 'shine..but', 'message', 'movie', 'not', 'good', 'one', 'theme', 'story', 'are', 'thief', 'lier', 'con', 'man', 'who', 'law', 'daily', 'basis', 'general', 'detriment', 'society..it', 'okay', 'as', 'long', 'give', 'back', 'community', 'same', 'ridiculous', 'message', 'allot', 'today', 'modern', 'rap', 'music', 'culture', 'respect', 'criminality', 'African', 'American', 'community', 'should', 'be', 'eliminated', 'not', 'celebrated', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'not', 'good', 'movie', '.it', 'horrible', 'message', 'African', 'American', 'actors', 'actresses', 'get', 'chance', 'create', 'something', 'owe', 'community', 'be', 'socially', 'responsible', 'message', 'are', 'sending', '.or', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'send', 'message', 'all..just', 'make', 'good', 'movie..I', 'threw', 'DVD', 'out', 'one', 'viewing', '.save', 'money']",Stick Up Kids

1298799,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B002XUBE0A,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","A group of Harlem con artists rob rich people and live by the Three Musketeers' motto. After amassing millions and living in a low end rental, they decide they need to pull one more big job before retirement. One gang member gets shot and put in a wheel chair. While in prison he gives us the ""great white conspiracy"" speech to give a substandard movie some mock substance. Somehow I don't see the Feds controlling interest rates as targeting blacks, but maybe that is just me.At this point the movie turns from a light con artist film to a heavy film about the Moors, the original owners/ settlers of NYC, and how the white man keeps the black man down. The movie gets bogged down with this theme and doesn't integrate it into the film as well as other films have done. Coupled with bad acting and poorly written dialouge, this production lost my interest after the wheel chair speech. For those who believe in the white vs. black conspiracy  ideas, they might find an interest in this film in spite of its short comings.N-word, F-bomb, sex, no nudity.",2,"DON'T HATE THE PLAYERS, HATE THE GAME",1340582400,"06 25, 2012",2012,1053,"['group', 'Harlem', 'con', 'artists', 'rob', 'rich', 'people', 'live', 'Three', 'Musketeers', 'motto', 'amassing', 'millions', 'living', 'low', 'end', 'rental', 'decide', 'need', 'pull', 'one', 'more', 'big', 'job', 'retirement', 'One', 'gang', 'member', 'shot', 'put', 'wheel', 'chair', 'prison', 'great', 'white', 'conspiracy', 'speech', 'give', 'substandard', 'movie', 'mock', 'substance', 'Somehow', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Feds', 'controlling', 'interest', 'rates', 'targeting', 'blacks', 'maybe', 'just', 'me.At', 'point', 'movie', 'light', 'con', 'artist', 'film', 'heavy', 'film', 'Moors', 'original', 'owners/', 'settlers', 'NYC', 'how', 'white', 'man', 'black', 'man', 'down', 'movie', 'bogged', 'down', 'theme', ""n't"", 'integrate', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'done', 'Coupled', 'bad', 'acting', 'poorly', 'written', 'dialouge', 'production', 'lost', 'interest', 'wheel', 'chair', 'speech', 'who', 'believe', 'white', 'vs.', 'black', 'conspiracy', 'ideas', 'might', 'find', 'interest', 'film', 'spite', 'short', 'comings.N-word', 'F-bomb', 'sex', 'nudity']",Stick Up Kids
