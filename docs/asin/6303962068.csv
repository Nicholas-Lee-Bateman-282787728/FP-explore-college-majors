I have been a Joan Crawford fan for over 20 years and I can say this is definitely one of her best performances.  She always chews the scenery, but this role was apparently so true to life it can be a bit disturbing; and more than a little sympathetic.  I just think Joan has been given the shaft on DVD though.

392869,A2T74RP19O2K4Q,6303962068,Ben,"[4, 6]","It's Joan in a pretty house that, for some unexplained reason, she is obsessive about.  She's also a manipulative creep.  There is not a warm bone in this woman's body, though she obviously inspires a warm bone in her husband.  She uses sex on her puppet-husband, so she's either very good at it, or he's very stupid.  Six of one, a half dozen of the other, take your pick.  There's a cousin floating around the house as her assistant.  Harriet Craig needs an assistant because, obviously, the maid and the cook are too busy doing other things.  No one can move in Harriet Craig's house without her say-so.  Even the little boy next door gets the heave-ho.  And if you're going to invite your boss for dinner, don't sit and play cards with his wife at THAT table and move THAT lamp because now you've screwed up everything.  And really, if you're going to be a shaking idiot of a maid you WILL be fired.  ESPECIALLY IF YOU BREAK ONE OF MY COFFEE CUPS.Harriet has been upwardly mobile since her father left her and her mother when she was 14.  Now her mother is in a sanitarium (good, good, out of the way) and dad is either dead or vanished completely (good, good, out of the way).  That leaves Harriet and her husband.  Eventually, even her hen-pecked husband can't stand it and while she won't come downstairs for him, she will come downstairs when she hears a vase smash to smithereens.Many believe that this was about as close to an autobiographical role for Joan than any other.

392878,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,6303962068,JGC,"[10, 13]","I love this movie so much. ""Harriet Craig"" has to be one of Joan's very best dramatic roles and one of, if not the very best film she ever made during the 50's....Why is this movie so perfect?Now more than ever before, Joan played such a personal role. I am not going to say that Harriet Craig was just like Joan. But I think this was her most private movie role, either before or since; because Harriet was so fundamental.As you already know, Miss Crawford plays the title-role, Harriet Craig. Harriet is a domestic artist (in 1950 when this movie came out, the term was known as ""housewife."") Harriet lives with her husband, Walter (played by Wendell Corey) and her adult (yet, somewhat younger) cousin, Clare Raymond (portrayed by K.T. Stevens.)The Craig's are an upper-middle class family. They live in a beautiful colonial home that Walter grew up in. And, Harriet takes much pride in managing her home. In fact, she has made it her life-long reason for living to make sure everything in her home is absolutely up to the high standards that she has always had. For example, Harriet doesn't like the blinds opened past 11:00 a.m. because as she put it, ""I am not going to have the sun fade my furniture."" Of course, she has a grand wrapping staircase that empties into an elaborate foyer. But it goes without saying that Harriet's two domestics (Mrs. Harold played by Viola Roache and Lottie played by ""Grandma Walton"" aka, Ellen Corby) are relegated to using the back entrance to go up and down the house floors. It was somewhat interesting to see Harriet scold Lottie for using the front stairs. Joan looked even more frazzled and caught off guard than her counterpart; perhaps, because she knew the importance of keeping a good home?The movie has a lot of subtext and maybe even secondary subplots. For example, Harriet was made out to be this huge mean-spirited villain. By the end of the movie the film's director wanted the viewer to dislike Harriet because (by now) Harriet had managed to chase everyone in her life away from her. But what did she do that was so wrong? She wanted to make sure that her home always looked perfect and she liked to keep her hubby on a (somewhat) close leash. One might argue that any good wife would do the things that Harriet did?I really picked up that the others in her life (besides her sweet cousin, Clare) all had an attitude problem. Harriet's husband, Wendell was a huge wimp. He let all the women in his life tell him what to do. He lived in his parents' home his entire life, then when his mother passed on he married a woman that would baby him. And, if that's not bad enough, he also had a full-time maid, Mrs. Harold that loved to kiss and pamper his bee-hind. Why? Speaking of Mrs. Harold, she had such a personality problem. She was simply an hourly maid; so why did she think she was in the same league as Mrs. Craig? The woman was so stuck-up and persnickety towards Mrs. Craig. Maybe she was envious of Mrs. Craig? Maybe not. One thing I am certain of is that she resented Mrs. Craig. Mrs. Harold resented her because she thought she should run the home, not Mrs. Craig.And if this isn't bad enough, Harriet had to put up with her neighbor who made Mrs. Kravitz look like a walk in the park. Mrs. Frazier (Fiona O'Shiel) was a huge busy-body that was looking to weave her widow's web right around Harriet's husband. She even used her young son, Danny (Pat Mitchell,) to lure Walter to her home. I can't think of anything lower than to use a small child in such a disgraceful and wanton way. But Walter (always) fell for it! Hook, line and sinker.Here's a little bit of trivia: Kathryn Card played  Mrs. Norwood (a bit/uncredited role) in this film. Of course Kathryn Card is world-famous for portraying Mrs. McGillicudy; the mother of everyone's favorite redhead!The last scenes between Walter and Harriet are probably Joan's most pivotal acting ever. Again, I must reiterate, this was her most exclusive role ever. And over the years since this movie has been out (57 to be exact) it has been written that Joan was just playing an extension to herself. I do not know if that is true or not. What I do think is true is that Harriet just wanted some happiness. She wanted someone to give her a chance. She was always afraid to let her true self show because she couldn't trust anyone; least of all, a man. And when Walter finally got a good look at the real Harriet do you know what he did? He walked out on her.Many years later, when asked about this movie, Miss Crawford only said this, ""'Harriet Craig' was all right. Formula but not too bad. At least I played a woman with which a portion of the audience could identify. Or is it, 'with whom?'"" Maybe there's a little bit of Harriet Craig inside all of us. Someone that just wants to be understood and loved, unconditionally.",5,the Queen of Clean,1194566400,"11 9, 2007",2007,4839,"['love', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'Harriet', 'Craig', 'be', 'one', 'Joan',

392882,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6303962068,Lawyeraau,"[34, 35]","This is an engrossing film of a cold, calculating, and manipulative woman, Harriet Craig, who is married to Walter Craig, a very nice man who adores her. She lives in an impeccably appointed mansion with him, has two servants, and a poor relation, Claire, who caters to her every whim. Life should be great. Wrong!Harriet is not happy, unless she is able to control everyone and everything around her. A regular martinet and perfectionist, she is cruel to the servants and totally self absorbed. If something does not revolve around Harriet, then it is of no import. She stops at nothing to get what she wants, even if it means destroying those who love her.Harriet keeps her husband on a short lease, and he is so besotted by her that, at first, he does not even notice. She is a master at maintaining her own status quo. Then, one day she goes too far. Walter is going get a long awaited promotion that will require him to travel abroad. As this does not fit in with Harriet's plans, she surreptitiously moves heaven and earth to quash the promotion. At first, Walter is puzzled by his change of circumstances, but when he discovers Harriet's treachery, no more Mr. Nice Guy.Joan Crawford is magnificent as the cold, implacable, and  shrewish Harriet. Wendell Corey is wonderful as the besotted husband, who has his kind heart ripped out by his wife's perfidy. Look for a wonderful performance by the delightful Lucille Watson, as the perceptive wife of Walter's boss. While Harriet may have fooled everyone else, she certainly did not fool her.This is a wonderful film that all Joan Crawford fans will love. Aficionados of classic films will, likewise, enjoy it.

392886,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6303962068,Simon Davis,"[16, 16]","""Harriet Craig"" is a startling and awe inspiring movie which is dominated from beginning to end by Joan Crawford in a standout performance as the character of the title, a cold and calculating woman used to getting her own way in all things. Never was a role more tailor made for an actress than this one and it is a tribute to Joan Crawford's great (and often underrated) talent that she manages to pull it off and add extra dimension to an otherwise unlikeable character.This film was based on the stage play and previous movie starring Rosalind Russell called ""Craig's Wife"" and deals with a domineering and manipulative woman who runs her beautifully furnished home like an army base and also controls the lives of her husband and servants as she sees fit. Despite having everything in life to make her happy Harriet is only content when she has people to herself, namely her Husband  Walter played superbly by Wendall Corey and her cousin Clare (KT Stevens). What transpires is in a way a very sad tale of a woman who by her perfectionism destroys everything she ever had.Despite being the monster she undoubtedly is there is one scene were Harriet retells some of her childhood history and it goes along way towards explaining her current manical behaviour. Joan Crawford is always  superb in playing anguished women forced into hazardous situations. Here she is in her element as she manages to stop Walter obtaining a great job promotion to Japan to keep him with her, manages to break up Clare's relationship with Wes Millar, Walter's assistant and stricks terror into all her staff when they fail to meet her impossibly high standards.Wendall Corey, an often underrated actor, is excellent in the role of Harriet's besotted husband who ultimately learns the hard way about Harriet's calculating ways. the scenes after he realizes Harriets calculating manipulation are superb as he turns the tables on her at the dinner table and flushes out all the deceit and lies that Harriet has told about all those who are supposedly dear to her. He proceeds to smash one of Harriet's prized Chinese antique vases and that is a symbol that what Harriet had is now finished, broken and cannot be repaired. Fiona O'Sheil and Ellen Corby also score in the roles of Harriet's domestic staff who suffer under her perfectionist yoke. O'Sheil in particular has a wonderfully dramatic scene when she resigns from the staff and warns Harriet about having a beautiful house which has no warmth or love in it.""Harriet Craig"" while a quite disturbing film to watch, filled as it is with a manipulative central character and surrounding people who in one way or the other are victims, is a splendidly acted piece of movie making which is totally engrossing. Despite her character's faults I still feel an element of pity for Harriet, in particular during the scenes with her mother where the lack of love and deprivation of her childhood goes at least part of the way towards explaining her adult actions. Joan Crawford is of course the whole movie and she makes ""Harriet Craig"" a memorable viewing experience.  If like me you are a Crawford fan you will definately see it as one of Joan's very best later performances.

Moser ""The Austin Chronicle""","[6, 9]","Joan, with director Sherman, trimming *all* the fat away from *Craig's Wife* (that means removing every scene in which Joan would *not* be present), and turning it into a tour-de-force for La Crawford. As the epitome of every neurotic, deeply disturbed female that Joan ever portrayed, *Harriet Craig* is Joan with a capital J. Taking the role in her mouth and shaking it into submission, she is playing, ultimately, another facet of Joan herself. But what Joan film role *didn't* become Joan herself - either before or *after* filming? In a case of Joan's art imitating her life, as well as her life imitating her art, Harriet provides Joan with yet *one* more of those peculiar roles - roles which must have been written with *only* Joan in mind, since it would be difficult to imagine *any* other actress in this role. If Rosalind Russell had had this much focus on her in *her* version, *Craig's Wife*, it's hard to imagine if she could have sustained it, since part of Russell's strength was her ability to respond to other characters while seemingly on a course all her own. But Joan, never one to shy away from *any* movie role, makes *Harriet Craig* one the great milestones of her career. And we are indebted to her for it. As she explains to her niece (she *always* has nieces in movies like this - sweet young things who come to live with her and become her indentured servants) about how to ""keep men in line,"" we are given more pure-Joan philosophy. With lines like, ""...the average woman *does* put her life in someone else's hands - her husbands'. That's why she usually comes to grief,"" and ""No man is *born* ready for marriage - he has to be trained,"" it is familiar Joan territory. Familiar now, because we've seen Joan spackling her angst all over movie and TV screens for decades, but along with *Mildred Pierce*, *Queen Bee* and *Torchsong*, *Harriet Craig*, at the time, was a new dimension in Joan's personal psychosis committed to film.",4,Joan To The Bone,1106352000,"01 22, 2005",2005,1960,"['Joan', 'director', 'Sherman', 'trimming', 'fat', 'away', '*Craig', 'Wife*', 'removing', 'scene', 'Joan', 'would', '*not*', 'be', 'present', 'turning', 'tour-de-force', 'La', 'Crawford', 'epitome', 'neurotic', 'deeply', 'disturbed', 'female', 'Joan', 'ever', 'portrayed', '*Harriet', 'Craig*', 'Joan', 'capital', 'J', 'Taking', 'role', 'mouth', 'shaking', 'submission', 'playing', 'ultimately', 'facet', 'Joan', 'what', 'Joan', 'film', 'role', 'become', 'Joan', '*after*', 'filming', 'case', 'Joan', 'art', 'imitating', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'life', 'imitating', 'art', 'Harriet', 'Joan', 'yet', '*one*', 'more', 'peculiar', 'roles', 'roles', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'written', '*only*', 'Joan', 'mind', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'imagine', '*any*', 'other', 'actress', 'role', 'Rosalind', 'Russell', 'had', 'had', 'much', 'focus', '*her*', 'version', '*Craig', 'Wife*', 'hard', 'imagine', 'could', 'have', 'sustained', 'part', 'Russell', 'strength', 'was', 'ability', 'respond', 'other', 'characters', 'seemingly', 'course', 'own', 'Joan', 'never', 'one', 'shy', 'away', '*any*', 'movie', 'role', '*Harriet', 'Craig*', 'one', 'great', 'milestones', 'career', 'are', 'indebted', 'niece', 'nieces', 'movies', 'sweet', 'young', 'things', 'who', 'come', 'live', 'become', 'indentured', 'servants', 'how', 'keep', 'men', 'line', 'are', 'given', 'more', 'pure-Joan', 'philosophy', 'lines', 'average', 'woman', '*does*', 'put', 'life', 'someone', 'else', 'hands', 'husbands', 'why', 'usually', 'grief', 'man', '*born*', 'ready', 'marriage', 'be', 'trained', 'familiar', 'Joan', 'territory', 'Familiar', 'now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Joan', 'spackling', 'angst', 'movie', 'TV', 'screens', 'decades', '*Mildred', 'Pierce*', '*Queen', 'Bee*', '*Torchsong*', '*Harriet', 'Craig*', 'time', 'was', 'new', 'dimension', 'Joan', 'personal', 'psychosis', 'committed', 'film']",Harriet Craig VHS
392888,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,6303962068,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[4, 5]","Before reading the following review please keep in mind that this is a Region 2 DVD and will not play in any Region 1 DVD or Blue Ray player. Your DVD or Blue Ray player has to be equipped to play any region DVD. These players are known as Region Free machines. Unfortunately, ""Harriet Craig"" has never seen a Region 1 North American release, but has been released in foreign countries, most notably Spain where other Joan Crawford films from her Columbia years have seen a limited DVD release. Those films include ""The Story of Esther Costello"", ""Autumn Leaves"", and ""Berserk!"".Having been a huge fan of Joan Crawfords for the past 20 years I have studied her films closely. In 1950 she was dating her director Vincent Sherman who had recently worked with Crawford on ""The Damned Don't Cry"". The much married Sherman was having an affair with Crawford and would direct Joan in the follow-up film ""Harriet Craig"" (as well as 1951's ""Goodbye, My Fancy"") that was based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning play ""Craig's Wife"" which was turned into a 1930's motion picture starring Joan's friend and co-star from ""The Women"", Rosalind Russell. In this version Joan plays a woman married to a successful engineer, played by Wendel Corey. Joan's character, Harriet, is more concerned with the running of her house and expects her servants to do what they are told or face harsh consrquences. She announces she can't have any children because her husband Walter ""doesn't like kids"". So despite the fact that Harriet's home is devoid of any little creatures she still demands to have three servants working for her, one as her maid, the other her cook, and one as her secretary/confidant who is a cousin she took in.The movie really is the best film in Joan's library of motion pictures that has her portraying a character that really resembles what she (Crawford) was like in real life. From the reading I have done on Joan her portrayal of Harriet Craig wasn't that much of a stretch for her. In reality Crawford was a control freak, wanted her home cleaned impeccably, and was obsessed with neatness. At the beginning of the movie Harriet tells her maid that she wants the window blinds closed before 11:30 am as she doesn't want the sunlight fading things. She then instructs her to take care of her most prized possession, a vase that stands above the fireplace. Before leaving the house Harriet gives the maid a long list of instructions that she expects her to remember. If you have read Joan's daughter's memoir ""Mommie Dearest"" you can't help but see the similarities between Crawford and the role she played in this film. In one part of the book Christina talks about Joan's film ""Queen Bee"" and how she had to leave the theatre upon viewing it as she stated, ""That wasn't any acting job on mother's part. That was exactly the way I knew her at home"". I have a feeling Christina was talking about ""Harriet Craig"" as she got the films confused in her mind.There are also some amazing supporting players in ""Harriet Craig"": among them are the wonderful Ellen Corby who played Harriet's maid Lotty. ""Lotty is completely hopeless""; ""Now look at what you've done!""; ""Mrs. Harrold will send you your wages minus the cost of the cup!""; are some of the lines Harriet barks at the innocent and vulnerable Lotty before she fires her. Ellen would become quick friends with Joan in real life and go on to win three Emmys for her role as Grandma Walton in ""The Waltons"". Another great performance is by KT Stevens who plays Harriet's cousin/secretary Claire. Stevens is most famous for her television soap opera work on ""General Hospital"" and ""Days of Our Lives"" in the 1960's, and for playing psychotic Vanessa Prentiss on ""The Young and The Restless"" from 1976-1981.I really believe director Sherman conferred with the script writers on ""Harriet Craig"" to put as many Joan Crawford attributes into the role as possible. Like Harriet Joan's father deserted her and her mother when she was only a child, and most alarmingly like Harriet Joan worked in a laundry to put food on the table before she became an actress.An excellent film, if you want to see the real Joan Crawford forget about ""Mommie Dearest"" although that film does have a ring of truth to it. Watch ""Harriet Craig and see Joan Crawford play Joan Crawford.""Harriet Craig"" finally gets a DVD release in November, 2012 when it will be available in a beautiful box set by Sony/TCM called ""Joan Crawford in the 1950's"".

392889,A3IP0R4JOD4R5G,6303962068,the masked reviewer,"[5, 5]","In the1935 film Craig's Wife, we get Rosalind Russell, the woman for whom the word ""madcap"" seemed coined, whose giddy portrayals of fast-talking, double-dealing dames with machine-gun delivery - acting! Well, it turns out that Miss Russell could act, but she often didn't get the chance once she'd been typecast as a motor-mouthed madonna. However, in playwright George Kelly's Pulitzer Prize-winning story of an overbearing, scheming matron who is a little too involved with her possessions, she acts her marvelous, little heart out. Mr. Kelly, uncle of Princess Grace, has written one of the all-time great female roles, one that any actress would give her eyeteeth to play.So, in 1950, full-time Star Joan Crawford, along with director/lover Vincent Sherman, streamlined ""Craig's Wife"" (removing every scene that didn't include Ms Crawford), retitled it ""Harriet Craig"", and turned it into a tour-de-force for the Diva. The epitome of every neurotic, deeply disturbed female that Joan ever portrayed, Harriet Craig is a housewife - married to her house, a monster of control who cares more about her home and her possessions than she cares about her marriage. Because of her domestic obsession, she alienates friends and family.Crawford, then in her middle forties, was in yet another phase of her remarkably resilient career, which had taken her from flapper to proletarian working girl to fur-swathed glamour queen to steely, against-all-odds survivor. Her subsequent roles were even fiercer. Sherman was the first, (but not the last), to see the similarities between Harriet Craig and Joan Crawford. As he recalled in his 1996 autobiography, ""I realized that in many ways, she was the embodiment of Harriet Craig...in her obsessive attitude toward her home; her distrust of men and her desire to control; her power of manipulation; and her concept of the proper way for a man to behave toward his wife."" Years later, when Crawford's daughter Christina published her tell-all memoir, Mommie Dearest, it was not difficult to see those same parallels in her daughter's description of Crawford's compulsive housekeeping.Harriet Craig is a must for any true collector of Ms. Crawford's film work.",5,The PERFECT companion piece to MOMMIE DEAREST!,1187481600,"08 19, 2007",2007,2198,"['the1935', 'film', 'Craig', 'Wife', 'get', 'Rosalind', 'Russell', 'woman', 'whom', 'word', 'madcap', 'seemed', 'coined', 'giddy', 'portrayals', 'fast-talking', 'double-dealing', 'dames', 'machine-gun', 'delivery', 'acting', 'Well', 'out', 'Miss', 'Russell', 'could', 'act', 'often', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'once', ""'d"", 'been', 'typecast', 'motor-mouthed', 'madonna', 'However', 'playwright', 'George', 'Kelly', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize-winning', 'story', 'overbearing', 'scheming', 'matron', 'who', 'little', 'too', 'involved', 'possessions', 'marvelous', 'little', 'heart', 'out', 'Mr.', 'Kelly', 'uncle', 'Princess', 'Grace', 'written', 'one', 'all-time', 'great', 'female', 'roles', 'one', 'actress', 'would', 'give', 'eyeteeth', 'play.So', '1950', 'full-time', 'Star', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'director/lover', 'Vincent', 'Sherman', 'streamlined', 'Craig', 'Wife', 'removing', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'Ms', 'Crawford', 'retitled', 'Harriet', 'Craig', 'turned', 'tour-de-force', 'Diva', 'epitome', 'neurotic', 'deeply', 'disturbed', 'female', 'Joan', 'ever', 'portrayed', 'Harriet', 'Craig', 'housewife', 'married', 'house', 'monster', 'control', 'who', 'more', 'home', 'possessions', 'marriage', 'domestic', 'obsession', 'friends', 'family.Crawford', 'then', 'middle', 'forties', 'was', 'yet', 'phase', 'remarkably', 'resilient', 'career', 'had', 'taken', 'flapper', 'proletarian', 'working', 'girl', 'fur-swathed', 'glamour', 'queen', 'steely', 'against-all-odds', 'survivor', 'subsequent', 'roles', 'were', 'even', 'fiercer', 'Sherman', 'was', 'first', 'not', 'last', 'see', 'similarities', 'Harriet', 'Craig', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'recalled', '1996', 'autobiography', 'realized', 'many', 'ways', 'was', 'embodiment', 'Harriet', 'Craig', 'obsessive', 'attitude', 'home', 'distrust', 'men', 'desire', 'control', 'power', 'manipulation', 'concept', 'proper', 'way', 'man', 'behave', 'wife', 'later', 'when', 'Crawford', 'daughter', 'Christina', 'published', 'tell-all', 'memoir', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'was', 'not', 'difficult', 'see', 'same', 'parallels', 'daughter', 'description', 'Crawford', 'compulsive', 'housekeeping.Harriet', 'Craig', 'must', 'true', 'collector', 'Ms.', 'Crawford', 'film', 'work']",Harriet Craig VHS
