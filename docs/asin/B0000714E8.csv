724225,AAOT8ZNO94H0V,B0000714E8,Dean Anderson,"[7, 9]","I find this film fascinating for its subtext. It begins with a San Francisco family torn apart: A father's untimely death and his eldest daughter's demise in some far off part of Europe during the politically charged 1960s.Left behind are the mother and youngest daughter. When the daughter wants to answer the lingering questions she has about her big sib, she sets out to trace the path that her sister took, and to find out what she could about the events.Of course, she is cautioned every step of the way, first by her mom, then by her sister's long time beau, who very reluctantly and uncomfortably begins to recount the story of their excursion across the continent and their involvement with the &quot;peace movement,&quot; and what he knew about his lover's death.The &quot;Generation Gap&quot; I refer here is the elder &quot;Baby Boom&quot; daughter, played by Cameron Diaz, and her &quot;do anything&quot; free spirited ways, and her kid sis, portrayed in a very reserved performance by Jordana Brewster, who demonstrates how a few years can make a big difference in how you get treated. Here, seemingly trapped in her existence, she plays the part of a bird trying to find her way out of the cage she has been locked in for her life, and trying to get some answers from a world that seems intent on &quot;protecting&quot; her.This isn't an action picture. I wouldn't even consider it a road picture, even though it takes place in Amsterdam, Paris and Portugal, beautiful locations all. But it is a psychological drama, about putting people's actions into a context, be it historical or just understandable. If you're born between the late 50s to the mid 70s, this film just might strike an important chord with you.Wonderful performances from Diaz, Brewster, and Christopher Eccleston as the former boyfiend who plays tour guide to both Europe and his ex's final days.Recommended.",4,A Generation Gap Examined...,1084060800,"05 9, 2004",2004,1892,"['find', 'film', 'fascinating', 'subtext', 'San', 'Francisco', 'family', 'torn', 'apart', 'father', 'untimely', 'death', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'demise', 'far', 'part', 'Europe', 'politically', 'charged', '1960s.Left', 'behind', 'are', 'mother', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'When', 'daughter', 'answer', 'lingering', 'questions', 'big', 'sib', 'out', 'trace', 'path', 'sister', 'took', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'could', 'events.Of', 'course', 'cautioned', 'step', 'way', 'first', 'mom', 'then', 'sister', 'long', 'time', 'beau', 'who', 'very', 'reluctantly', 'uncomfortably', 'recount', 'story', 'excursion', 'continent', 'involvement', 'quot', 'peace', 'movement', 'quot', 'what', 'knew', 'lover', 'death.The', 'quot', 'Generation', 'Gap', 'quot', 'refer', 'here', 'elder', 'quot', 'Baby', 'Boom', 'quot', 'daughter', 'played', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'quot', 'do', 'anything', 'quot', 'free', 'spirited', 'ways', 'kid', 'sis', 'portrayed', 'very', 'reserved', 'performance', 'Jordana', 'Brewster', 'who', 'how', 'few', 'years', 'can', 'make', 'big', 'difference', 'how', 'get', 'treated', 'Here', 'seemingly', 'trapped', 'existence', 'part', 'bird', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'cage', 'been', 'locked', 'life', 'trying', 'get', 'answers', 'world', 'intent', 'quot', 'protecting', 'quot', 'her.This', ""n't"", 'action', 'picture', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'consider', 'road', 'picture', 'even', 'place', 'Amsterdam', 'Paris', 'Portugal', 'beautiful', 'locations', 'psychological', 'drama', 'putting', 'people', 'actions', 'context', 'be', 'historical', 'just', 'understandable', ""'re"", 'born', 'late', '50s', 'mid', '70s', 'film', 'just', 'might', 'strike', 'important', 'chord', 'you.Wonderful', 'performances', 'Diaz', 'Brewster', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'former', 'boyfiend', 'who', 'tour', 'guide', 'Europe', 'ex', 'final', 'days.Recommended']",N/A

I for one don't need my feelings and thoughts dictated to me, in the way that many 'popcorn' movies do. A way that many people have gotten used to it seems, and that made them lazy. And as for the 60's, this film is certainly not without its (implicit) criticism about the era...This film challenges you to think for yourself, and make up your own mind. In my book that's a good thing.We see how Faith gets overwhelmed by her fathers projections: in his view she's born in the right age to change things - unlike himself, a wannabe painter who's stuck in an office job. Faith and Phoebe believe that's what brought him to an early grave, and Faith sets out to fulfill her fathers dreams, which have now become her own.Always looking for more, pushing further and further, Faith crosses the line  and ventures into violent and extremist circles. Too late she realizes she went too far, and there's no way back - at least in her mind.One of many thing that this film shows 'between the lines' is how easy it is to stray too far, and how hard it is to take one step back after you've crossed a certain line. And I'm not (just) talking about the ending of the film. It's clear to see how estranged Faith is from her old hippie friends after she comes back from the extremist RAF circles. She's still on an adrenaline buzz when she comes back, thinking the extremists were the real deal and oh so very exiting, whilst she perceives her old friends as 'boring' and merely 'wasting their time with slogans and banners'. Misguided as she is, she sees the terrorists as the only ones who are really making a difference. She can't relate to her friends anymore, and that's one more reason why it all went so horribly wrong...The younger sister Phoebe sets out to follow Faith's footsteps, be it just to find out how it could have been possible that her happy, fun loving sister suddenly committed suicide.It's a 'coming of age' drama in a way, but in a sense that we all have to find our own way, not follow blindly in the footsteps of others. It also makes a point that violence is never the answer. The only way to ever really change things is by setting a positive example, reach out to others, and keep on struggling to find our own truth.",4,Moving and Realistic 'Coming of Age' Drama,1195344000,"11 18, 2007",2007,2419,"['people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', ""n't"", 'fill', 'blanks', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', ""60's.That"", 'too', 'bad', 'own', 'way', 'little', 'gem', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'feelings', 'thoughts', 'dictated', 'way', 'many', 'movies', 'do', 'way', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'gotten', 'used', 'made', 'lazy', '60', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'implicit', 'criticism', 'era', 'film', 'think', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind', 'book', 'good', 'thing.We', 'see', 'how', 'Faith', 'overwhelmed', 'fathers', 'projections', 'view', 'born', 'right', 'age', 'change', 'things', 'wannabe', 'painter', 'who', 'stuck', 'office', 'job', 'Faith', 'Phoebe', 'believe', 'what', 'brought', 'early', 'grave', 'Faith', 'out', 'fulfill', 'fathers', 'dreams', 'have', 'now', 'become', 'own.Always', 'looking', 'more', 'pushing', 'further', 'further', 'Faith', 'line', 'ventures', 'violent', 'extremist', 'circles', 'Too', 'late', 'went', 'too', 'far', 'way', 'back', 'least', 'mind.One', 'many', 'thing', 'film', 'lines', 'how', 'easy', 'stray', 'too', 'far', 'how', 'hard', 'take', 'one', 'step', 'back', ""'ve"", 'crossed', 'certain', 'line', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'talking', 'ending', 'film', 'clear', 'see', 'how', 'estranged', 'Faith', 'old', 'hippie', 'friends', 'back', 'extremist', 'RAF', 'circles', 'still', 'adrenaline', 'buzz', 'when', 'back', 'thinking', 'extremists', 'were', 'real', 'deal', 'oh', 'so', 'very', 'exiting', 'whilst', 'old', 'friends', ""'boring"", 'merely', ""'wasting"", 'time', 'slogans', 'banners', 'Misguided', 'terrorists', 'only', 'ones', 'who', 'are', 'really', 'making', 'difference', 'ca', ""n't"", 'relate', 'friends', 'anymore', 'one', 'more', 'reason', 'why', 'went', 'so', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'younger', 'sister', 'Phoebe', 'out', 'follow', 'Faith', 'footsteps', 'be', 'just', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'possible', 'happy', 'fun', 'loving', 'sister', 'suddenly', 'committed', 'suicide.It', ""'coming"", 'age', 'drama', 'way', 'sense', 'have', 'find', 'own', 'way', 'not', 'follow', 'blindly', 'footsteps', 'others', 'also', 'point', 'violence', 'never', 'answer', 'only', 'way', 'ever', 'really', 'change', 'things', 'setting', 'positive', 'example', 'reach', 'others', 'keep', 'struggling', 'find', 'own', 'truth']",N/A
