The price you pay for all 5 seasons plus a disc of awesome extras is unbelievable.  The packaging is fun, creative and user friendly.  Love the shag carpet lining on the set and the booklet inside details all the episodes.  Many criticize the cardboard storage case that holds all the discs and say the glue gets all over their discs and that discs are scratched.I love the way the discs are held.  It is very important to handle all dvds with care and it makes sense to do that here.  Pull them out and place them back in by the edges.  None of my discs are scratched and there is nothing that gets on the discs that would cause any damage to my dvd player.  I find this set a pure delight.For the show, I grew up with the Brady's and it is very emotional to watch the early years when family values and true caring is shown thru very simple but heartfelt tales.  The seasons develop to have the kids center stage as they mature very well looks wise and acting ability wise.  No one will ever forget MARCIA, MARCIA, MARCIA.This box set is a must for those of us who grew up with this wonderful family and for those who did not - discover them now.  The magic is still alive.The show lived on in many different forms for decades after its weekly run ended.  There is a Christmas movie reunion, a drama series episode and cartoons just to name a few of the extras.  As I said, don't be scared off by those who dislike the packaging.

I loved the show, I loved all of the characters and my first crush was on Cindy.(don't give me that look, I was only 6 years old at the time!!) Of course as time passed I kind of left the Brady's behind (or thought I had) and moved onto other things.A few months ago while channel surfing with my daughter I saw a block of ""The Brady Bunch"" coming up and wanted to show my daughter what I used to watch when I was a kid. We pop on the first episode and it's one of my favorites; Greg is making a movie about the first Thanksgiving and of course all of the Bradys' get involved, and before long my daughter and I are laughing out loud.That was it, I was hooked again! And better yet, my daughter loved the show as well!!We began taping the two episodes which played daily, but I began to notice that the episodes that aired were edited for time. Sometimes entire sub-plots were removed?! So I jumped onto Amazon and saw this set and knew I had to get it.This set is fantastic!! From the unique outside packaging with the shag carpet, to the booklet which is included, to the bonus disk featuring a couple of the Brady made-for-tv movies, this is a box set that any fan of the show will love. I noticed that several reviewers didn't care for the cardboard flip-flower thing that actually holds the disks, but I prefer it to having a bunch of plastic shells. The entire flip-flower thing is easily removed from the box, and each disk slides in and out of it's slot easily (unlike the last few ""Simpsons"" box sets) so even with regular use, the disks shouldn't scratch.If you are a fan of the show, then this is a must own!!",5,Groovy Set for Fans,1360281600,"02 8, 2013",2013,1654,"['grew', 'up', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'loved', 'show', 'loved', 'characters', 'first', 'crush', 'was', 'Cindy', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'look', 'was', 'only', '6', 'years', 'old', 'time', 'course', 'time', 'passed', 'kind', 'left', 'Brady', 'behind', 'thought', 'had', 'moved', 'other', 'things.A', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'channel', 'surfing', 'daughter', 'saw', 'block', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'coming', 'up', 'wanted', 'show', 'daughter', 'what', 'used', 'watch', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'pop', 'first', 'episode', 'one', 'favorites', 'Greg', 'making', 'movie', 'first', 'Thanksgiving', 'course', 'Bradys', 'get', 'involved', 'long', 'daughter', 'are', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud.That', 'was', 'was', 'hooked', 'again', 'better', 'yet', 'daughter', 'loved', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'began', 'taping', 'two', 'episodes', 'played', 'daily', 'began', 'notice', 'episodes', 'aired', 'were', 'edited', 'time', 'Sometimes', 'entire', 'sub-plots', 'were', 'removed', 'jumped', 'Amazon', 'saw', 'set', 'knew', 'had', 'get', 'it.This', 'set', 'fantastic', 'unique', 'outside', 'packaging', 'shag', 'carpet', 'booklet', 'included', 'bonus', 'disk', 'featuring', 'couple', 'Brady', 'made-for-tv', 'movies', 'box', 'set', 'fan', 'show', 'will', 'love', 'noticed', 'several', 'reviewers', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'cardboard', 'flip-flower', 'thing', 'actually', 'disks', 'prefer', 'having', 'bunch', 'plastic', 'shells', 'entire', 'flip-flower', 'thing', 'easily', 'removed', 'box', 'disk', 'slides', 'slot', 'easily', 'last', 'few', 'Simpsons', 'box', 'sets', 'so', 'even', 'regular', 'use', 'disks', 'should', ""n't"", 'scratch.If', 'are', 'fan', 'show', 'then', 'must', 'own']",The Brady Bunch: Complete Series Pack - Seasons 1-5

I think being that they had the discs that it would not have been to much to ask to have made the packaging a lot more sturdy and also the disc to be held in much better casing. The outside shag carpet is great but the Brady Bunch Flower on front and the side view would have been awesome to have been made to look like it was one of those retro puffy stickers!

I had this DVD collection on my wish list for several years now and when Amazon offered it as a Gold Box special several weeks ago I could not resist. clocking in at almost 50 hours of pure Brady entertainment it is truly a set worth purchasing. I am reliving my childhood all over again growing up with the Brady Kids, Susan Olsen and I are about the same age, so I truly grew up with then Brady kids. they were the perfect family that to me set the standard for all families of the early 70's. Who can forget such episodes like ""The Cincinnati Kids"" when they all go to Kings Island Amusement Park and ride all the cool rides. or what about their trips to the Grand Canyon and Hawaii. Those were the good ole days of television.I felt it was my duty to address the issues other reviewer has complained about concerning the packaging. first of all I have learned from experience that some people are looking for something to complain about and aren't happy unless they find fault in everything. With that said does the packaging have issues? Yes, but the issues aren't nearly as bad as other reviewers claim them to be; out of 20 or so disks in the collection I found a very small amount of glue on the edge of 1 DVD which was very easily wiped off with a little alcohol and a soft cloth. The only other issue is the actual sleeves the Disks are stored in; yes they are cardboard and you should probably store them somewhere safer. This seems to be a problem with all the studios that produce an entire series/movie collection in one gimmicky massive set(i.e. M*A*S*H Martinis & Medicine Collection); while they are really neat to look at they are very impractical to store the collection in over the long run.

I grew up watching this classic program and can proudly say that I know every single show by heart. I can see a show for just a split second and know the exact and precise plot; is this a gift or a curse? But, that doesn't mean these shows ever get boring. There's always room for ""The Brady Bunch"" because this happy family can bring a smile to anyone's face.The late and much-loved Robert Reed played the Brady patriarch, Mike Brady. Mr. Brady was always the sense of reason. Every time I see him I instantly think of Carol saying, ""Whatever your father says."" Or, I think of the kids saying to Mike (after he kindly put them in their place, so to speak), ""I never thought of it like that..."" Robert Reed was an awesome actor. Because he played the part very seriously. He didn't care that it was only a kid's show. No, to him it was a real family. And, not too many guys can pull off a perm but Mike looked pretty hot. Before joining ""The Brady Bunch,"" Robert Reed was on the classic '60s detective drama, ""The Defenders.""Speaking of hot, Florence Henderson was one hot mama; playing Carol Brady n&eacute;e Martin (and her maiden name was Tyler.) It was never established, but I have always believed that Carol was widowed. She wasn't divorced, because at a time in American culture this was still a controversial subject. (Of course in theThe Brady Bunch Movie / A Very Brady Sequel, she is a divorc&eacute;e, but that's certainly not the same storyline.) Carol was the world's best mom. She was always there for her kids, but she didn't baby them. Carol treated all of her kids like adults. One of my favorite eps with Carol was during the ep ""Every Boy Does It Once."" Bobby wanted to run away because he didn't feel needed or wanted, and Carol says, ""it's a big world out there; you didn't think I was going to let you go alone."" Since, ""The Brady Bunch"" Flo has kept busy. She had a couple talk-shows and has acted in movies. She even wrote a cookbook,Florence Henderson's Short-Cut Cooking: America's Favorite Mom Helps You Get Dinner On The Table Fast. But no matter what she does, she will always be most loved for being Carol Brady.A member of the Brady Family that is tremendously underrated is Alice Nelson (Ann B. Davis.) I just loved Alice. What can I say about Alice that you don't already know? She was always there when the Brady's needed her and never around when they didn't. But she wasn't viewed as a ""maid."" Nope, Alice was a bona fide member of the family. Alice was seamstress, chef, nursemaid, listener, friend and at times even surrogate mother for the entire Brady Family. I don't think the Brady's could ever survive without Alice and Alice could never survive without them. And didn't Alice's dishes always look so good? I don't think she cared about carbs or fat-grams. There's also a great cookbook that Ann B. Davis wrote,Alice's Brady Bunch Cookbook. In the '50s Ms. Davis was best known as the lovable, ""Schultzy"" from her two-time Emmy-winning role on ""The Bob Cummings Show.""Greg was the oldest Brady brother, played by Barry Williams. Greg enjoyed singing, playing the guitar, baseball, and surfing. And Greg was always girl-crazy. One of my favorite eps with Greg is ""Our Son, the Man."" This is the one where Greg moved into Mike's den and gets a ""groovy"" new outfit to impress a senior at school. There are many books about ""The Brady Bunch,"" but Barry Williams wrote the very best book that I have ever read,Growing Up Brady : I Was a Teenage Greg. Barry, aka Johnny Bravo, even had his own CD:Return of Johnny Bravo.Marcia was the oldest Brady girl, played by Maureen McCormick. For lack of a better word, Marcia was perfect. She was a cheerleader, a writer on the school newspaper and she had more friends and boyfriends than she knew what to do with. She also had the most perfect blonde hair in the world. Marcia also had a really beautiful voice, remember when she sang? In 1997 Maureen played country-singer, Barbara Mandrell in a critically-acclaimed movie. Maureen even released music into the `90s that has somewhat of a country flair,When You Get a Little Lonely. And, earlier this year Maureen was on ""Celebrity Fit Club"" and got into fit shape! I understand Maureen is currently writing a book that will be out next year!Peter (Christopher Knight) was probably the most thoughtful Brady boy. He was always around to lend a helping hand and he always felt remorse when he did something wrong. Remember ""The Personality Kid"" ep? Peter tries to come up with a new personality because he is afraid that no one likes him. But he learns that even saying ""pork chops and applesauce"" can't buy him friends if he doesn't like himself first. Of course, Chris Knight is well-known now by an entirely new generation, thanks to ""The Surreal Life"" and his very popular reality-show, ""My Fair Brady.""Jan, aka Marcia's little sister (Eve Plumb) was one of my very favorite Brady's. I always felt bad for Jan. She had to spend her entire childhood living in Marcia's shadows. Jan tried everything to branch-out and be her own person; she tried being a pom-pom girl, a painter, a tap dancer and even a writer. All with no success; because Jan was always the perpetual loser. Of course Jan uttered the most famous lines on ""The Brady Bunch,"" when she said, ""Marcia, Marcia Marcia."" Don't worry Jan, I still love you. After ""The Brady Bunch"" ended, Eve became the ""Brady"" who was most reluctant to talk about her past. She even branched out into many different roles which were the complete opposite of the sweet and shy Jan. She was in the '79 movie Little Women. One of Eve's best roles was playing a nun in a series of eps on ""The Facts of Life.""Bobby was the youngest Brady boy, played by Mike Lookinland. Bobby was the type of kid that a parent had to always watch because he was slick. He would do something when no one was looking. He also had a tendency to snitch; remember when he became a safety-monitor and started using his authority to his own advantage by busting all of his bothers and sisters, not to mention the kids at school?Speaking of snitches, Cindy Brady was the youngest Brady child; played by the considerably more intelligent Susan Oleson. This child was purely dumb a as a doorknob which only made her more funny than the rest. Cindy also had an incredibly large mouth; she would repeat anything and everything she (over)heard. She was referred to as ""the baby"" at least once by Marcia and I think that was more because of the way she behaved than because of her actual age. Before being cast as cute Cindy, Susan had a bit part in one of The King's last movies, The Trouble with Girls.And rounding out the cast is Sam ""the butcher"" Franklin (played by the legendary character actor, Allan Melvin also famous for another ground-breaking '70s sitcom, All in the Family - The Complete First Season.) And, towards the end of Season Five, Cousin Oliver (child character actor, Robbie Rist) joined the family. Also members of the extended Brady Family were Tiger the Dog (real name: Tiger) and Fluffy the Cat (pilot ep, only) (real name: unknown.) Cindy also got a couple of rabbits in the last ep that she wanted to sell, named Romeo and Juliet (real names for both: who cares.)It really is hard to say who my favorite character is because I feel like I know them all so well. They Brady's are like a member of my own family. How can I choose one over the other? I suppose if I had to choose, I would pick Jan and coming in at a close second would be Cindy and Alice, tied.""The Brady Bunch"" was always extremely educational for children. I started watching ""The Brady Bunch"" in the late `80s when I was 7 or 8 and it really taught me a lot. I didn't come from a large family, but perhaps I learned from ""The Brady Bunch"" the importance of family and the importance of sharing with others. I also learned more basic lessons in history. For example, when my family went to HI, I already knew about Pearl Harbor & the USS AZ (courtesy of ""The Brady Bunch."") I also learned about Early American History, specifically Benedict Arnold, as he was spoken about more than a couple of times.There was another very important lesson that ""The Brady Bunch"" taught me. I learned that just because a family was not physically related didn't mean that they couldn't love each other just as much and be just as close as any other nuclear family. The Brady's were a blended-family (I hate the word step, and as Carol said to Bobby, as she pointed towards the steps leading upstairs to the bedrooms, ""those are the only steps in the house..."") that was no different from any other family. Through ""The Brady Bunch"" I learned that family can really be whatever you make of it.It took me years to realize that ""The Brady Bunch"" was (supposed to be) in actuality a children's TV show. I used to think that this was how all families lived and I thought that this was how all `70s TV shows were. Of course, I was very wrong. But wouldn't it be great if we all lived in a Brady World!""The Brady Bunch"" never ""jumped the shark."" Of course there were better eps at times. But there is not a single season that is worse than the others. This is very rare for long-running sitcoms that produce in excess of 100 eps (the Brady's did 117.) ""The Brady Bunch"" was always consistent because each season was top-quality television entertainment. Below, is a list of all the eps from the entire run of ""The Brady Bunch.""Season OneThe Honeymoon (original air-date: 9/26/1969)Mike marries Carol and all havoc breaks out at the reception when Tiger gets out of the car.Dear Libby (original air-date: 10/3/1969)Dear Libby is an advice columnist who ""tells it like it is.""

However, after getting to the bottom of things, Mike and Carol agree that Marcia can have the party.

But it's just a client of Mike's; Natalie Schafer plays the role of Penelope Fletcher.The Hustler (original air-date: 3/1/1974)Mike's boss sends him a pool table.  Jim Backus has another part in this classic series as Harry Matthews.The Hair-Brained Scheme (original air-date: 3/8/1974)Bobby sells hair tonic that turns Greg's hair orange-blonde. Meanwhile, Cindy starts selling bunnies. When neither one can turn a buck, they both decide to bleach their bunnies and sell them back to the pet store. This is the last ep of ""The Brady Bunch"" and unfortunately Robert Reed refused to appear in this show because he thought it lacked continuity.The performances of the entire cast was always first-class. Especially the acting of the children, it was impressive to watch them because they were such talented actors and actresses, even at such young ages. It's not uncommon for child actors to just be glorified props. But, not on ""The Brady Bunch."" I don't think Sherwood Schwartz would ever have stood for that. When Cindy cried, I thought they were real tears, not ""crocodile tears."" When Marcia made snide remarks to Jan, such as, ""don't get mad at me if boys don't find you attractive,"" you could hear the meanness in her voice. When Peter was afraid to participate in the glee club you could see the blatant sadness and desperation written all over his face. When Alice slipped and fell (on the kids' game board,) it really looked like she almost broke her neck.Another aspect of the show that I know is imperative is how Mr. and Mrs. Brady always believed in their children and always encouraged them. When Carol saw a pack of cigarettes fall out of Greg's coat pocket (""Where There's Smoke,"") she immediately believed him when he said they weren't his. There was absolutely no question about this. When Marcia wanted to get Davie Jones (""Getting Davie Jones"") to perform at her school, instead of telling her that she was chasing waterfalls her parents even helped her! When Mike thought that Greg wanted to be an architect he was the proudest man in the world; and even after he saw that Greg had no talent, he still tried to help him. When Carol told Marcia that they believed she was telling the truth (""The Slumber Caper,"") she was ecstatic to see that her parents believed in her. And, Mike even went to Marcia's school because he believed in his daughter and he wanted to find out what exactly happened. When Bobby tried to win a trophy his entire family went out of their way to help him. If I got a buck for every time Carol and Mike encouraged Jan during all of her identity-breakdowns I would be a rich person. And, at the end of the day, it didn't matter to the Brady's that there kids weren't perfect. It didn't matter because to them, what was most important was just getting in the game and giving it a good try.The DVD's include the full eps; there are 2 ""Complete Series Sets."" I prefer this set just because it has that groovy-retro '70s look. Sherwood Schwartz, creator of ""The Brady Bunch,"" is to put it mildly, a genius. I am certain that there isn't a more wholesome TV show that the entire family can enjoy! Remember, you are what you watch!",5,"If you know who George Glass was, you might be a Brady-addict",1193875200,"11 1, 2007",2007,31444,"['am', 'proud', 'be', 'Brady-addict', 'can', 'be',

956454,A19552QR80XTOX,B000CCBCI0,Jungle Red,"[3, 3]","I held out on buying this set for the longest time for two reasons: I'm not a Brady superfan (I like the show but I can easily go years without watching it and not have withdrawals) and the reviews about the packaging terrified me. There's nothing worse than spending a boatload of money on a huge DVD set only to have not work. I am happy to report that all the problems others encountered with glue and unplayable discs did not happen to me. I don't know if it's because Paramount fixed the shoddy packaging or because I didn't buy this via Amazon (perhaps Amazon gets a different batch?), but there are no glue issues and my disc play fine.All that said, I won't bore readers with an in-depth review of the actual show. If you're over the age of ten, you likely know what The Brady Bunch is about. Episodes are sweet, simple and a bit campy. There are many instances of bad hair (Greg and Mrs. Brady) and awful clothes (all the men!) and a good solid lesson to be learned at the end of each episode (ie don't play ball in the house, fire safety is important). The Brady Bunch is one of those great, feel good shows that you can throw on and just let the sugar syrupy goodness rush over you.The main draw for me was the special features. I've been longing to rewatch the 1988 television film A Very Brady Christmas for years now and I finally(!) have the entire movie on DVD. Yes, it's a very corny and attempts to bring the Bradys into the 1980s is kind of hilarious but there is something comforting and downright sweet about it. Also included are two episodes of the animated series The Brady Kids. I wasn't alive when this originally aired and, I presume, this never aired in syndication or in a very limited market because I've never seen it. It's your run of the mill, somewhat terrible Filmation cartoon version of the show. It's interesting for the purpose of nostalgia but this is not one of the many Brady spin-offs that I think people are chomping at the bit for. Last on the special feature list is The Brady 500, a two hour television film which is actually two episodes of the huge failure that was The Bradys. In case you're not in the loop, the success of A Very Brady Christmas lead to creation of comedy/drama series The Bradys that aired briefly in 1990. It was intended to be an updated version of The Brady Bunch with touches (or shall I say huge slaps) of dramatic elements as hour long dramas were popular television staples at the time. While I was fully aware of A Very Brady Christmas at the time it was released, I don't recall The Bradys. Judging by how long it lasted, I'll venture a guess that other people weren't aware of it either. Without giving too much away, The Brady 500 takes a few risks storyline-wise that probably left audiences a bit confused and weirded out. Bad things just don't happen to the Bradys and it's a bit disconcerting to see them facing bad things. The Brady 500 is a bit painful to watch because some of the acting is terrible (as is the theme song that is poorly written and bellowed out by Florence ""Mrs. Mike Brady"" Henderson) but it's an interesting and somewhat odd period at the end of the Brady sentence.Now, for the bad aspects. I honestly don't have an issue with anything that is on the discs. All the episodes look great and are seemingly in tact. What I don't care for is the on the outside as I do not like the shag carpeting packaging and the cheapo box. I've always been more interested in the material on the discs that what the packaging looks like. For a while there, a lot of studios were releasing kitchy box sets (think theFull House: Complete Series Collectionwith a box shaped like the Tanners' house andThe Golden Girls: 25th Anniversary Complete Collectionwith a box shaped like Sophia's purse). I never went for these because I know part of the (high) price in sets like these goes towards the ill conceived cutesy boxes that are fun to look at in passing but typically irritating to deal with in real life. The Brady Bunch set is no exception. The shag on the outside of the box of my set is already falling off in bits. Nothing says awesome like finding neon green bunches of lint on your clothing and carpet. Inside, the discs are held in a hot pink paper daisy that fit into a cardboard square. As I stated previously, there is no sticky glue on my set so I have no beef with the paper daisy but it is rather cheap looking and feeling. Thus far it holds the discs surprisingly well but I would have preferred something more standard and a lot sturdier. A small quibble in the grand scheme of things however.Overall, this is a solid release that I think most BB fans enjoy. Very few channels reair the series and I'm happy to have them at my disposal along with a few cool bonus features. Now, if only we could get Paramount to release The Brady Brides, the remainder of The Bradys and the awesomely bad Brady Bunch Variety Hour!",5,A Super Cool and Totally Groovy

I love the packaging. What I like about the set is that its the same as if you bought them separately but they throw in a bonus disc which i happen to love. I personally had A Very Brady Christmas on my Tivo for the past 6 months but was able to delete it because paramount included it in its bonus features.

956464,A1URXSRV6WDHVY,B000CCBCI0,Marty Gillis,"[5, 5]","There are many good reviews here so mine will just focus on the condition of the actual product received and not the content which we can all agree takes us (and our kids) back to a kinder, simpler time.My Brady Bunch box set included all the proper discs. None of them had any of the much mentioned glue on them.  The little booklet was included along with the Bonus disc. Overall, I was quite pleased and not put off by the disc holder as it is very similar to the one in the ""I Love Lucy"" box and as long as you handle the discs with care it won't damage them to keep using the holder. On the other hand it would be simpler and easier to just put them all in double sided plastic sleeves.** Remember, it is the TOP of the discs that are the most fragile with a scratch or deep scuff possibly leading to the dreaded 'Disc Rot"" syndrome.I found the printing on the discs themselves to be of average or better quality and the booklet to be of great help with decent episode synopsis organized by season.This makes it VERY handy for finding exactly the show you want with ease. Thanks Paramount!It appears the first season has been restored while the remaining season seem a bit flat in the color department, but overall good. I just use my Oppo Color Enhancement feature and they pop with 70's goodness! Just bumping up your color saturation control a few notches will yield a similar benefit. The audio, while glorious mono, is fine (except for a slight problem I have detailed below) and sounds better than it EVER did in the original broadcast back in the day!  The disc menus are very good and overall the disc authoring is well done. Each program averages around 25 minutes without commercials and it is a real treat to see them this way again with little or no cuts.  All five glorious seasons of Sherwood and Lloyd Schwartz's schmaltzy classic!  Just the thing to settle down to with a nice serving of Pork Chops and Applesauce!I have but one complaint about my particular set. It was purchased new from Amazon and factory sealed, however the green ""Shag"" carpeting has a large stain on it in the upper left hand corner of the front cover. Perhaps the Brady's pooch Tiger did his business on mine? It sure looks that way...***Ok, just one more slight complaint. (minor for me really, but might be very serious for others) For those of you who use a sub woofer while viewing your discs, you may wish to just shut it off for these. The reason is there is a low frequency rumble/humming on most all episodes that is constant, almost like an electrical grounding problem when this was mastered for disc. It also might be a problem that goes back to the original production. Hard to say now. The only thing I can say for sure is it IS there. RATS! Listening on headphones would be OUT as you could not escape it then, but turning off my sub makes it tolerable, although I can still hear the low freq rumble. A few other old DVD sets I own have this exact problem as well.Other than the stain on my green shag and the low freq rumble in the audio, the entire set was pristine and complete.

I checked every single disc, and there was nothing on them at all.  I checked near the bottom of the packaging, and there was no glue anywhere to be found.  I couldn't have been happier to see this.  There were only two problems.  First, I bought it as a gift for my mother, and I opened it to investigate.  So I'm sad that I'm giving it to her opened.  Second, in fear that the the case would be an unsuitable storage environment for the discs, I bought a CD zipper case to go along with them.

I bought this because it's a better price than buying one season at a time, and for the bonus DVD.  One downside with the bonus is that ""The Brady Girls Get Married,"" the first Brady Bunch movie, wasn't on the disc (which is severely lacking.  I wish it was released on DVD or at least on VHS.  My collection's imcomplete).  I don't really care about the Brady Brides and the Bradys TV series (short-lived, each about 10 episodes or less), but since it included the Christmas and the Bradys movies, I wish it had included said movie.I agree that the packaging is lacking.  Although the flip file rolodex type format is a cute idea, it doesn't really hold up to scrutiny.  There's a high probability of disc damage (which ruins discs) due to them not being properly stored.  I read that another reviewer purchased a small capacity CD wallet (24 disc) to store hers in (which I think I'm going to do myself).  I'd also recommend purchasers do that.

I actually bought the series in all the season individual boxsets, but had to purchase this set because of the bonus DVD. If you can spare the money and want to take a chance on the discs not being damaged buy this set. If your contented in having all the show's individual boxsets pass on buying the complete series set.""The Brady Bunch"", despite its popularity in syndication and on the TBS Superstation in the '80's and early '90's, never entered the Top 25 while it was originally shown on ABC from 1969-1974. It became the perfect half hour sitcom when it began to be broadcast everyday after kids were home from school: that is when I discovered the Bradys. A simple series with simple characters and storylines, ""The Brady Bunch"" will always live on in the hearts of viewers for years to come.There have been two outstanding books written on the ""The Brady Bunch"": the first was ""Growing Up Brady"", written by Barry Willimas who played Greg. That book has a ton of information on the show and features an episode guide as well as air dates. The second is Maureen McCormick's splendid and outspoken memoir, written in 2008 called ""Here's The Story"". It also features informative info on Maureen's time as Marcia Brady.",5,"""Wonderful Series, But Packaging Isn't Up To Par""",1247356800,"07 12, 2009",2009,1859,"['Nearly', 'anyone', 'who', 'owned', 'TV', 'past', 'forty', 'years', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'series', 'place', 'American', 'pop', 'culture', 'series', 'die', 'complete', 'series', 'boxset', 'features', 'single', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'episode', '117', 'disc', 'neat', 'bonuses', 'including', '1988', 'Christmas', 'TV', 'movie', 'Very', 'Brady', 'Christmas', 'helped', 'bring', 'new', 'notoriety', 'series', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'boxset', 'shoddy', 'packaging', 'Paramount', 'unfortunately', 'carelessly', 'produced', 'set', 'many', 'have', 'said', 'discs', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'scratched', 'way', 'were', 'housed', 'actually', 'bought', 'series', 'season', 'individual', 'boxsets', 'had', 'purchase', 'set', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'can', 'spare', 'money', 'want', 'take', 'chance', 'discs', 'not', 'being', 'damaged', 'buy', 'set', 'contented', 'having', 'show', 'individual', 'boxsets', 'pass', 'buying', 'complete', 'series', 'set', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'popularity', 'syndication', 'TBS', 'Superstation', ""'80"", 'early', ""'90"", 'never', 'entered', 'Top', '25', 'was', 'originally', 'shown', 'ABC', '1969-1974', 'became', 'perfect', 'half', 'hour', 'sitcom', 'when', 'began', 'be', 'broadcast', 'everyday', 'kids', 'were', 'home', 'school', 'when', 'discovered', 'Bradys', 'A', 'simple', 'series', 'simple', 'characters', 'storylines', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'will', 'always', 'live', 'hearts', 'viewers', 'years', 'come.There', 'have', 'been', 'two', 'outstanding', 'books', 'written', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'first', 'was', 'Growing', 'Up', 'Brady', 'written', 'Barry', 'Willimas', 'who', 'played', 'Greg', 'book', 'ton', 'information', 'show', 'episode', 'guide', 'as', 'well', 'air', 'dates', 'second', 'Maureen', 'McCormick', 'splendid', 'outspoken', 'memoir', 'written', '2008', 'called', 'Here', 'Story', 'also', 'informative', 'info', 'Maureen', 'time', 'Marcia', 'Brady']",The Brady Bunch: Complete Series Pack - Seasons 1-5

Terry,"[1, 1]","Once I got past the Breaking Bad purchases for Christmas in a good way, I decided to treat myself to this charming sitcom, which ran on ABC-TV from 1969-74.  Of course, in researching reviews previously made regarding the glue issue, I had concerns about how this would play out for me come XMAS morning.  Well, here it is, XMAS morning...and I am happy to report, knock on wood, that there is no glue issue on any of my discs.  I have played only one episode on one of the discs thus far, which was the XMAS episode from the series' first season.  Be it that particular episode aired in 1969, I was surprised when I made the selection that a cast photo came on first.  Originally, I thought it was something inherent in the DVD itself...until I learned that it was an original tag of the series being presented &#34;IN COLOR&#34;.  Gee, imagine that!!!!!!  I never truly saw that coming at all!!!!  But I also remember that TV Guide used to have the color insignia next to its color program listings as late as this year before eventually dropping that distinction not long thereafter.  But to have a Brady Bunch episode lead with an &#34;IN COLOR&#34; tag is truly a pleasant surprise indeed!!!!  I am looking forward to reacquainting myself with this series I remember fondly in my youth as I welcome The Bradys into my TV DVD collection and my home as well!!!!!

Having said that, NO OTHER TV SHOW provides a departure from the real world more than the Brady Bunch. A family of 9 (yes, I count Alice) living under one roof and actually getting along? Try finding that in this day & age. But that's why reruns of the show are still on TV to this day. The show's unique nostalgia and charm never seems to get old.I ordered this collection as part of my week long birthday celebration (along with taking a week vacation from work). When it arrived, I couldn't believe my eyes - The Brady Bunch box set in SHAG carpeting? How 70's is that?! Even the packing is true to the era. Of course the real deal is what's inside the box - Every episode from all 5 seasons, the movies (The Brady 500 & A Very Brady Christmas) and a double episode of The Brady Kids cartoon - 21 discs total with an episode guide. And it was only $89.95!I spent each day of my vacation watching an entire season - and it was fun! I watched everything - the trips to the Grand Canyon & Hawaii (both 3-part episodes), Jan's middle child issues, Marcia's popularity & dating issues (boy, did she grow up hot!), Peter's voice changing, The musical episodes (Adios, Johnny Bravo) and more - A thoroughly enjoyable week-long stroll down memory lane!This Brady box set is a must own for any fan of this classic show - if they don't own it already.

I like to think of the Bradys as friends with whom we all could relate to and hope that their special problems might mirror our own. Sure they seem dated and very controlled for the time, but somehow reflect an innocence and style of good moral upbringing despite the ever-changing world around them. Greg, Marcia, Jan, Peter, Bobby and Cindy all have the problems that many children deal with today and we follow their stories with amazement. The circumstances might be hokey or impossible at first, but the messages are still very clear and hold true, even today. Mr. Brady and Mrs. Brady and Alice, all support and understand the difficulties and situations that they witness and never fail to live up to their love for their children. Maybe this is why the show has such a grip on so many fans...
