The screenplay is enjoyable to watch... again, at times.But in the end, my prevailing impression of it was one of ""Sakes alive, those men are VAIN."" Because, the amount of self-worship the movie involved had me simultaneously laughing and groaning through the whole thing. It approaches creepy.For example, in the end when the young boys witness Siegfried and Roy standing before them, shining in full show regalia while gazing outward as though basking in their own inner glory. Or when the movie demonstrates clips from their own show, which are obviously staged especially for the film itself. The angle by which the camera approaches the two men seems to purposefully make them appear more grandiose and mystical.In conclusion, it was boring. If it weren't only 40 minutes long, I would have turned it off long before its ending. It was half illustrated history book and half PETA rebuttal, with teeny tidbits of staged show tricks peppered throughout.It would have been more fun to watch if only it had to do with the actual show, not just the two men themselves.",2,Hmmm.... nah.,1173657600,"03 12, 2007",2007,1118,"['gorgeous', 'graphics', 'touching', 'times', 'screenplay', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'again', 'times.But', 'end', 'prevailing', 'impression', 'was', 'one', 'Sakes', 'alive', 'men', 'are', 'VAIN', 'amount', 'self-worship', 'movie', 'involved', 'had', 'simultaneously', 'laughing', 'groaning', 'whole', 'thing', 'creepy.For', 'example', 'end', 'when', 'young', 'boys', 'witness', 'Siegfried', 'Roy', 'standing', 'shining', 'full', 'show', 'regalia', 'gazing', 'outward', 'basking', 'own', 'inner', 'glory', 'when', 'movie', 'clips', 'own', 'show', 'are', 'obviously', 'staged', 'especially', 'film', 'angle', 'camera', 'two', 'men', 'purposefully', 'make', 'appear', 'more', 'grandiose', 'mystical.In', 'conclusion', 'was', 'boring', 'were', ""n't"", 'only', '40', 'minutes', 'long', 'would', 'have', 'turned', 'off', 'long', 'ending', 'was', 'half', 'illustrated', 'history', 'book', 'half', 'PETA', 'rebuttal', 'teeny', 'tidbits', 'staged', 'show', 'tricks', 'peppered', 'throughout.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'fun', 'watch', 'only', 'had', 'do', 'actual', 'show', 'not', 'just', 'two', 'men']",N/A

I saw them in Las Vegas at the Mirage hotel and I was about 15 feet from the stage and that would be the only way the view would be better. The production on the video is really good. Now that they are gone this video would bew great to have so you could truly see their great magic.,5,This is true magic,1240790400,"04 27, 2009",2009,376,"['really', 'enjoy', 'true', 'magic', 'watching', 'two', 'superb', 'magic', 'men', 'then', 'must', 'saw', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Mirage', 'hotel', 'was', 'about', '15', 'feet', 'stage', 'would', 'be', 'only', 'way', 'view', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'production', 'video', 'really', 'good', 'Now', 'are', 'gone', 'video', 'would', 'bew', 'great', 'have', 'so', 'could', 'truly', 'see', 'great', 'magic']",N/A

Don't miss this CD. I recommend it as a good souvenir of that show that was seen in Las Vegas during a long time because, perhaps, we will have no more opportunity to see them in such spectacle. Sigfried and Roy are the masters of the illusion (SARMOTI). It would be so interesting to have more DVD's about their magic shows.",5,Excellent DVD !,1220659200,"09 6, 2008",2008,461,"['Simply', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'story', 'two', 'worldwide', 'known', 'magicians', 'wonderfiul', 'performances', 'stage', 'are', 'unforgetable', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'CD', 'recommend', 'good', 'souvenir', 'show', 'was', 'seen', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'long', 'time', 'perhaps', 'will', 'have', 'more', 'opportunity', 'see', 'such', 'spectacle', 'Sigfried', 'Roy', 'are', 'masters', 'illusion', 'SARMOTI', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'interesting', 'have', 'more', 'DVD', 'magic', 'shows']",N/A
521073,A1PI8VBCXXSGC7,B00003CX51,Lynn,"[0, 0]","I first watched 'Siegfried & Roy: The Magic Box' in 3D on Time Warner Cable.  TWC offered it free. I enjoyed learning the background of these two entertainers. The 3D was amazing but in a few areas had  crosstalk/ghosting. I planned on watching it again on TWC, but it was removed from their line-up. At the time, TWC removed several free 3D programs  (a few months later the free 3D programs were added back to the line-up).This 3D version:When I searched Amazon, I found this 3D version which uses those cardboard glasses with one red lens & one blue lens. I was curious about the 3D quality & purchased this DVD for less than $3, plus shipping, from an Amazon seller.  I watched this documentary in 3D using the 3D glasses provided in the pkg (4 pairs are included), and the 3D looked awful. In some scenes,the plastic colored lenses even distorted the actual colors in the movie. It was so bad I couldn't finish the movie in 3D. Then I chose Standard to watch the movie. (the two choices are 'Standard' & '3D'). I thought many scenes looked blurry or fuzzy around the edges; the edges weren't well-defined. Probably because this isn't a blu-ray DVD. We have a 3D tv so I chose 2D to 3D, put on my active shutter 3D glasses & the movie looked good. Of course the 3D wasn't as visually exciting as watching it in 3D.I can't recommend this version of the documentary/movie if you're looking for a good 3D experience. However, I enjoyed learning the background of these two talented entertainers, and,  in the right format, the 3D is amazing. Also, if you're expecting to see an actual Siegfried & Roy performance, you'll be disappointed with this DVD.",3,Not the 3D we're used to viewing in 2011...,1329609600,"02 19, 2012",2012,1652,"['first', 'watched', ""'Siegfried"", 'Roy', 'Magic', 'Box', '3D', 'Time', 'Warner', 'Cable', 'TWC', 'offered', 'free', 'enjoyed', 'learning', 'background', 'two', 'entertainers', '3D', 'was', 'amazing', 'few', 'areas', 'had', 'crosstalk/ghosting', 'planned', 'watching', 'again', 'TWC', 'was', 'removed', 'line-up', 'time', 'TWC', 'removed', 'several', 'free', '3D', 'programs', 'few', 'months', 'later', 'free', '3D', 'programs', 'were', 'added', 'back', 'line-up', '3D', 'version', 'When', 'searched', 'Amazon', 'found', '3D', 'version', 'cardboard', 'glasses', 'one', 'red', 'one', 'blue', 'was', 'curious', '3D', 'quality', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'less', '3', 'shipping', 'Amazon', 'seller', 'watched', 'documentary', '3D', 'using', '3D', 'glasses', 'provided', 'pkg', '4', 'pairs', 'are', 'included', '3D', 'looked', 'awful', 'scenes', 'plastic', 'colored', 'lenses', 'even', 'distorted', 'actual', 'colors', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'could', ""n't"", 'finish', 'movie', '3D', 'Then', 'chose', 'Standard', 'watch', 'movie', 'two', 'choices', 'are', ""'Standard"", ""'3D"", 'thought', 'many', 'scenes', 'looked', 'blurry', 'fuzzy', 'edges', 'edges', 'were', ""n't"", 'well-defined', 'Probably', ""n't"", 'blu-ray', 'DVD', 'have', '3D', 'tv', 'so', 'chose', '2D', '3D', 'put', 'active', 'shutter', '3D', 'glasses', 'movie', 'looked', 'good', 'course', '3D', 'was', ""n't"", 'visually', 'exciting', 'watching', '3D.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'version', 'documentary/movie', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', '3D', 'experience', 'However', 'enjoyed', 'learning', 'background', 'two', 'talented', 'entertainers', 'right', 'format', '3D', 'amazing', 'Also', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'see', 'actual', 'Siegfried', 'Roy', 'performance', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'DVD']",N/A
