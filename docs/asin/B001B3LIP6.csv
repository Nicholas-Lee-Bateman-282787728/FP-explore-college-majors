1170303,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B001B3LIP6,Byron Kolln,"[1, 1]","This 25th Anniversary ""Silver Wedding"" special is a nice little coda to what remains one of the Beeb's best and brightest comedy series.  Peter Spence's TO THE MANOR BORN ran for three series, starring the inestimable Penelope Keith as the staunch Audrey fforbes-Hamilton, a woman who knows her place in the world (the historic Grantleigh Manor and Estate no less), but financial hardships prevent her claim to it!  Millionaire grocery store magnate Richard DeVere (Peter Bowles) snatches up the Estate and earns Audrey's wrath from the get-go with his grand plans of dragging Grantleigh - kicking and screaming if need be - into the hustle of the 1980s.  The final episode of TO THE MANOR BORN (watched by a record-breaking 24 million people during it's original transmission!) saw Audrey win back Grantleigh, and marrying Richard in the bargain.  Which sets the stage for the Silver Wedding special...Whilst preparing for their silver wedding celebrations, there's trouble brewing for Audrey and Richard.  All of their neighbours' estates have been swallowed up by wholesale food company Farmer Tom's (""And what's wrong with wibbly-wobbly carrots?"" quizzes Audrey).  Richard knows exactly what's wrong with them...and the revelation he has for Audrey will send her into a tailspin!  Good old Marjory Frobisher (Angela Thorne) has taken residency of the Lodge - complete with her menagerie of stray animals.  And Audrey welcomes the arrival of nephew Adam (Alexander Armstrong).  Of course the passage of time has also meant the loss of beloved characters Brabinger and Mrs. Poo; however the script includes some nice remembrances of them.Penelope Keith looses little step in re-assuming the character of Audrey.  She's still the glue holding the entire premise together.  And her chemistry with Peter Bowles is as palpable as ever.  Angela Thorne and Gerald Sim (as the Rector) add a nice touch of nostalgia.  Curl up and reunite yourself with the ""Manor"" family...it's every bit as magical as the original series.",4,"Penelope Keith and Peter Bowles rekindle ""Manor"" days",1283558400,"09 4, 2010",2010,2016,"['25th', 'Anniversary', 'Silver', 'Wedding', 'special', 'nice', 'little', 'coda', 'what', 'one', 'Beeb', 'best', 'brightest', 'comedy', 'series', 'Peter', 'Spence', 'TO', 'THE', 'MANOR', 'BORN', 'ran', 'three', 'series', 'starring', 'inestimable', 'Penelope', 'Keith', 'staunch', 'Audrey', 'fforbes-Hamilton', 'woman', 'who', 'place', 'world', 'historic', 'Grantleigh', 'Manor', 'Estate', 'less', 'financial', 'hardships', 'prevent', 'claim', 'Millionaire', 'grocery', 'store', 'magnate', 'Richard', 'DeVere', 'Peter', 'Bowles', 'up', 'Estate', 'Audrey', 'wrath', 'get-go', 'grand', 'plans', 'dragging', 'Grantleigh', 'kicking', 'screaming', 'need', 'be', 'hustle', '1980s', 'final', 'episode', 'TO', 'THE', 'MANOR', 'BORN', 'watched', 'record-breaking', '24', 'million', 'people', 'original', 'transmission', 'saw', 'Audrey', 'win', 'back', 'Grantleigh', 'marrying', 'Richard', 'bargain', 'stage', 'Silver', 'Wedding', 'special', 'Whilst', 'preparing', 'silver', 'wedding', 'celebrations', 'trouble', 'brewing', 'Audrey', 'Richard', 'neighbours', 'estates', 'have', 'been', 'swallowed', 'up', 'wholesale', 'food', 'company', 'Farmer', 'Tom', 'what', 'wrong', 'wibbly-wobbly', 'carrots', 'Audrey', 'Richard', 'exactly', 'what', 'wrong', 'revelation', 'Audrey', 'will', 'send', 'tailspin', 'Good', 'old', 'Marjory', 'Frobisher', 'Angela', 'Thorne', 'taken', 'residency', 'Lodge', 'complete', 'menagerie', 'stray', 'animals', 'Audrey', 'arrival', 'nephew', 'Adam', 'Alexander', 'Armstrong', 'course', 'passage', 'time', 'also', 'meant', 'loss', 'beloved', 'characters', 'Brabinger', 'Mrs.', 'Poo', 'however', 'script', 'nice', 'remembrances', 'them.Penelope', 'Keith', 'little', 'step', 're-assuming', 'character', 'Audrey', 'still', 'glue', 'holding', 'entire', 'premise', 'together', 'chemistry', 'Peter', 'Bowles', 'as', 'palpable', 'ever', 'Angela', 'Thorne', 'Gerald', 'Sim', 'Rector', 'add', 'nice', 'touch', 'nostalgia', 'Curl', 'up', 'reunite', 'Manor', 'family', 'bit', 'as', 'magical', 'original', 'series']",To the Manor Born: Silver Anniversary Special

1170308,A2POT13FER5L82,B001B3LIP6,it,"[1, 2]","I bought the original series DVDs when they first came out and watch them one or two times a year. I especially like the final episode which is much like the fairy tale about, ""They lived happily ever after.""Not so. To understand part of the plot you should watch the 30 minute special first. It describes the increasing number of government regulations that are putting small, independent farmers out of business.The most depressing part of the presentation is that the marriage has gone sour and Audrey and Richard have been reduced to the culturally lower class practices of keeping secrets from each other and playing underhanded, harmful tricks on each other. What is unforgivable is that Richard has made Audrey get rid of her dog. Fortunately there is a happy ending which I do not believe based on the 25 years of past experience. Any psychologist will tell you that the best predictor of someone's future behavior is their past behavior.Then you need to have a lot of suspended disbelief. Richard, the experienced business tycoon is faced with a lack of staff. He does not have the gumption to (1) hire more on his own, (2) do his own laundry or send it out, and (3) do his own cooking, even if it is TV dinners cooked in a microwave.Then you have to have business disbelief. Audrey owns the property yet has no control on what happens on it. A concert is to be held on the estate and yet there is no written contract. Richard can on a whim back out of the agreement. Another is that carrots that are not straight enough to be sold intact can easily be sold to be diced and put in soups etc.One minor irritation is that there are several continuity errors. Another sad part is that in the rare shots of the outside of the mansion you can see serious degradation to the building that has not been repaired because of deferred maintenance. I feel sorry for heirs of wealthy people. They get an albatross (stately mansion in this case)that drains what little wealth they have.",2,depressing to watch,1292112000,"12 12, 2010",2010,1982,"['bought', 'original', 'series', 'DVDs', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'watch', 'one', 'two', 'times', 'year', 'especially', 'final', 'episode', 'much', 'fairy', 'tale', 'lived', 'happily', 'ever', 'Not', 'so', 'understand', 'part', 'plot', 'should', 'watch', '30', 'minute', 'special', 'first', 'increasing', 'number', 'government', 'regulations', 'are', 'putting', 'small', 'independent', 'farmers', 'business.The', 'most', 'depressing', 'part', 'presentation', 'marriage', 'gone', 'sour', 'Audrey', 'Richard', 'have', 'been', 'reduced', 'culturally', 'lower', 'class', 'practices', 'keeping', 'secrets', 'other', 'playing', 'underhanded', 'harmful', 'tricks', 'other', 'What', 'unforgivable', 'Richard', 'made', 'Audrey', 'get', 'rid', 'dog', 'Fortunately', 'happy', 'ending', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'based', '25', 'years', 'past', 'experience', 'psychologist', 'will', 'tell', 'best', 'predictor', 'someone', 'future', 'behavior', 'past', 'behavior.Then', 'need', 'have', 'lot', 'suspended', 'disbelief', 'Richard', 'experienced', 'business', 'tycoon', 'faced', 'lack', 'staff', 'not', 'have', 'gumption', '1', 'hire', 'more', 'own', '2', 'do', 'own', 'laundry', 'send', 'out', '3', 'do', 'own', 'cooking', 'even', 'TV', 'dinners', 'cooked', 'microwave.Then', 'have', 'have', 'business', 'disbelief', 'Audrey', 'property', 'yet', 'control', 'what', 'concert', 'be', 'held', 'estate', 'yet', 'written', 'contract', 'Richard', 'can', 'whim', 'back', 'agreement', 'carrots', 'are', 'not', 'straight', 'enough', 'be', 'sold', 'intact', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'sold', 'be', 'diced', 'put', 'soups', 'etc.One', 'minor', 'irritation', 'are', 'several', 'continuity', 'errors', 'sad', 'part', 'rare', 'shots', 'outside', 'mansion', 'can', 'see', 'serious', 'degradation', 'building', 'not', 'been', 'repaired', 'deferred', 'maintenance', 'feel', 'sorry', 'heirs', 'wealthy', 'people', 'get', 'albatross', 'stately', 'mansion', 'case', 'what', 'little', 'wealth', 'have']",To the Manor Born: Silver Anniversary Special
