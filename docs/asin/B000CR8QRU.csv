961423,AIB1J75JT2MGI,B000CR8QRU,"Bruce Nichols ""Coffeeman""","[1, 1]","I have both this dvd and Outsourced. As with most comics, Russell Peters gets better with age. Outsourced has stronger material so if you're only planning to buy one dvd, get Outsourced. However, with 90 minutes of Russell Peters on this dvd, it is a good value and worth buying if you're enjoying Outsourced and want more.As far as the royalties issue goes, I am personally disgusted with Russell Peters for using his fans to get revenge against the company that put out this dvd.

961429,AP9RVNCXHB3OB,B000CR8QRU,Thayer,"[8, 11]","The bulk of his act is about race jokes so if you're a little sensitive to that subject, consider this a warning. But personally I think he knows his boundaries and I don't think he crossed any lines. In fact I think he is one of the ""tamer"" stand up comics. I don't remember any unnecessary swearing and the sex jokes were minimal and discreet. And he has such an innocent and childlike ""everyman"" quality about him that I find appealing, just like Ray Romano and Jerry Seinfeld.Grade: B+",4,Russell Peters,1146441600,"05 1, 2006",2006,489,"['bulk', 'act', 'race', 'jokes', 'so', ""'re"", 'little', 'sensitive', 'subject', 'consider', 'warning', 'personally', 'think', 'boundaries', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'crossed', 'lines', 'fact', 'think', 'one', 'tamer', 'stand', 'up', 'comics', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'unnecessary', 'swearing', 'sex', 'jokes', 'were', 'minimal', 'discreet', 'innocent', 'childlike', 'everyman', 'quality', 'find', 'appealing', 'just', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld.Grade', 'B+']",Comedy Now!
