501521,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00000G3TN,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Cop and a Half is one of those films in the same category as Rookie of the Year- light comedies with a small touch of drama that focuses entirely on having fun during a fantasy adventure.  I remember the early 90's was overcrowded with these type of movies.  Some of them look extremely dated these days to the point of being unwatchable while others hold up a little better.  Cop and a Half holds up enough for me to make a recommendation that it's quite okay to watch it.I don't even really need to mention the storyline because honestly the cover of the movie pretty much explains everything you need to know.  A little boy loves playing cops and robbers, and eventually gets the opportunity to actually BE a cop (or rather, tag along with the cops) because one day he witnesses a murder take place and realizes he can help the police officers track down the bad guys.It's definitely a movie that's supposed to be taken as strictly fun and nothing more.  Burt Reynolds does a fantastic job portraying the mean cop that doesn't give a darn about kids one way or the other, but eventually the kid and the cop team-up and become close friends.  You knew it was coming, and well, you'll know *everything* is coming believe me, because the storyline is entirely predictable.Still, for what it is -cheap family entertainment- it's worth watching.  Some of the action scenes are pretty entertaining themselves and personally remind me of the early 90's popular movie writing style that filled my childhood with absolute joy and actually made me think *this* is the next revolutionary step in writing a family friendly comedy.",4,"simple fun, and nothing more",1296950400,"02 6, 2011",2011,1621,"['Cop', 'Half', 'one', 'films', 'same', 'category', 'Rookie', 'Year-', 'light', 'comedies', 'small', 'touch', 'drama', 'entirely', 'having', 'fun', 'fantasy', 'adventure', 'remember', 'early', '90', 'was', 'overcrowded', 'type', 'movies', 'look', 'extremely', 'dated', 'days', 'point', 'being', 'unwatchable', 'others', 'hold', 'up', 'little', 'better', 'Cop', 'Half', 'up', 'enough', 'make', 'recommendation', 'quite', 'okay', 'watch', 'it.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'need', 'mention', 'storyline', 'honestly', 'cover', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'explains', 'everything', 'need', 'know', 'little', 'boy', 'playing', 'cops', 'robbers', 'eventually', 'opportunity', 'actually', 'BE', 'cop', 'rather', 'tag', 'cops', 'one', 'day', 'murder', 'take', 'place', 'can', 'help', 'police', 'officers', 'track', 'down', 'bad', 'guys.It', 'definitely', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'taken', 'strictly', 'fun', 'nothing', 'more', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'fantastic', 'job', 'portraying', 'mean', 'cop', ""n't"", 'give', 'darn', 'kids', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'eventually', 'kid', 'cop', 'team-up', 'become', 'close', 'friends', 'knew', 'was', 'coming', 'well', ""'ll"", 'know', '*everything*', 'coming', 'believe', 'storyline', 'entirely', 'predictable.Still', 'what', '-cheap', 'family', 'entertainment-', 'worth', 'watching', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'personally', 'remind', 'early', '90', 'popular', 'movie', 'writing', 'style', 'filled', 'childhood', 'absolute', 'joy', 'actually', 'made', 'think', '*this*', 'next', 'revolutionary', 'step', 'writing', 'family', 'friendly', 'comedy']",N/A

Golden II. Cop and a Half was actor Ray Sharkey's final film.SUMMARY: Meet the Tampa Police Department newest recruit: He's fearless. He's relentless. He's&#8230;eight years old! Director Henry Winkler serves up a hilarious, action packed treat the whole family will love, starring Burt Reynolds and introducing Norman D. Golden the second. Young Devon Butler is obsessed with being a cop. Whether he's memorizing lingo from Miami Vice or tailing suspects on the playground, this kid knows all the moves. In addition, when Devon witnesses a murder, he's eager to share what he knows with the police-for a price. In exchange, Devon demands to be made a cop-complete with badge, handcuffs and cool shades. Saddled with a pint sized squad car sidekick, hard-boiled detective Nick McKenna is not happy. However, when the crooks come gunning for the boy, Nick and Devon become real partners as they race against time to bring the bad guys to justice.

501526,A25RN8X70DSZLU,B00000G3TN,JRP,"[0, 2]","Ok I'm starting off my 20 years ago reviews for the month of April & I have 3 movies I am going to review. Starting off with this forgettable pos A Cop & Half & A Dollar Hat. I don't know why I added the dollar hat sub title all you need to know is I thought this movie was bad. This is 1 of those movies I can agree with the critics on. Anyway this movie was directed by Henry Winkler yes the man who played The Fonze on Happy Days. The movie stars Burt Renyolds as Detective Nick McKenna Renyolds needed the money I guess. Norman D Golden III as Devon Butler, Ray Sharkey as Vinnie Fountain this was Ray Sharkey's last movie reading up on him it's sad what happened to him. Also stats Holland Taylor as Captain Rubio. The story is this boy named Devon Butler who make believe's that he is a cop & his friend always plays the villain decent enough plot most kids want to be a cop when they grow up. Anyway he shoots a water gun at this teacher & he makes it look like the teacher p  e  e  d his pants. Anyway you have these 2 older boys who bully Devon. The Principal or whoever tells Devon's Grandma that he needs to stop playing cop. Devon & his friend follow a Detective named Nick McKenna who is chasing down some thugs this Detective chases after a couple of crooks even driving through residents yards. So 1 of the crooks manages to get to a get away car Devon writes the number down. Anyway McKenna causes some destruction to property catches the guy he was going after handcuffs him to the car & makes him walk which is dumb. Anyyway Devon's Grandma leaves him home alone cause she has to work at the hospital who leaves a kid under the age of 12 home alone in this day & age. Later that night Devon spots the get away car from earlier & follows it to this fish cannery. He sees this guy being murdered you have the introduction of the villain Vinnie Fountain who is the only character that has anything going for him. I mean Ray Sharkey is the only actor that is even trying. The Cops have a witness Devon he won't tell them anything until he gets to become a Cop. He tells them the licensce plate number & Burt Renyolds has to put up with this kid that's kind of annoying. They spend the day on stake outs looking for anybody involved with shady activites. Devon spots a man running with a purse Devon chases after him. The guy is trying to catch up with his wife who forgot her purse. I didn't laugh at all about 99 percent of the humor is fail in this movie. Not much of anything happens in this movie it's forgettable they looks for this dude named Bobo McKenna drops Devon off at his house. Devon & his friend come across the get away car those 2 bullies are going to beat him up he tells them that the car is his Grandma's car she wanted him to watch it for her this part I actually liked cause it was brillant those 2 bullies trash the mobsters car. If they put more thought into this movie & made where adults cold enjoy I might of liked it. I mean I saw this movie back in like 93 or 94 & I liked it it doesn't hold up. I mean I recently reviewed all 3 TMNT movies from the 90's especially part III. The 1st & 2nd movies hold up well that as an adult I can enjoy them. Anyway Devon goes home his Grandma tells him that there is a consler from school who wants to see him it turns out it is Vinnie Fountain & he is placed in the care of Detective McKenna. The Nostalgia Critic brought this up in his review why don't they just put Devon & his Grandma in Witness Protection. Detective McKenna doesn't like it 1 bit there was only 1 other bit of humor I liked where Detective McKenna reads Devon a betime story & it's a newspaper artical. Devon is on a traffic stop with another Cop I did laugh at the part where Devon gives his Principal a speeding ticket then you have those mobsters try to run Devon over & the part where Detective McKenna yells at Devon to warn him I do agree with The Nostalgia Critic you can't understand what Renyolds is yelling it sounds like DEVA. The NC's review of this movie is better than this movie. McKella saves him they go to this biker bar where they look for Bobo a big fight breaks out & they know who they are after the next morning McKella can't find Devon cause Devon was nice enough to get some Donuts for his hero. What does McKella do he acts like ap  ric  k to the kid for the nice gesture Devon goes back to school where is bullied by those 2 boys but he outsmarts them handcuffs them to a gate. The 2 mobsters show up a bunch of the kids distract the mobsters. Devon is in the backseat of the mobsters car he is caught yeah real smart he is taken to their hideout he is put in a room with a phone so convienant calls the cops McKenna is out looking for Devon & he spots Bobo steals Bobo's motorcycle takes his clothes no doubt this was Winkler's idea. McKella saves Devon you have a lame chase scene a lame boat chase & a c  rap ending & that is A Cop & Half with a dollar hat that is a forgettable movie. The is bad it doesn't hold up at all I forgot most of this movie in 5 or 10 minutes. Henry Winkler didn't direct much after this except TV shows so it pretty much sums up his capability as a director. Burt Renyolds needed the money I guess. Norman D Golden III rarely & I mean rarely do i ever agree with The Razzie's but I do agree with the nomination of worst new star. Never did mention Holland Taylor's character shows what I thought of her performance. Ray Sharkey was decent cause he atleast to give an over the top performance. Overall it's a pos . If you need to see it then it's on you tube.

501527,AUQUTT47CU3P7,B00000G3TN,L. Young,"[1, 1]","I REALLY enjoy this movie.  Little Devon Butler (played by Norman D. Golden II) gets bullied in school by two older guys whose favorite objective is to dunk him upside down into the toilet. Devon's favorite thing to do is play cop and dirtbag with his friend Ray Sanchez. Mr. Fleming is the school principal who thinks Devon is lying about the bullies and calls Devon's grandmother (his only guardian). Devon asks Fleming not to bother his grandmother (played by Ruby Dee) because she works hard as a nurse doing double shifts. This does not move Fleming who tells Devon ""you will never learn and I will have done you a great injustice."" Devon wants to be a cop so that he can take care of his grandmother. He makes sure she has her police whistle when she goes off to work.One day Devon and Sanchez see a real detective, Nick McKenna (played by Burt Reynolds), apprehend a suspect by running him down with his car because he ""hates to run"" and Nick ties him to the car and makes him run alongside back to the police station. Devon is impressed with Nick.One evening Devon follows the car of Nick's suspect to a warehouse where some small-time gangsters led by Mr. Falcon, a wannabe 50s singer, rub out the suspect. Devon is hiding in the rafters and witnesses his demise - AND Falcon's distinct shoes but not his face. Nick is on the case and Devon won't give any information to the police unless they make him a cop.Devon ends up riding with Nick as they hunt down suspects. When the bad guys find out about Devon, Falcon visits his grandmother while posing as a new school counselor. Grandmother thinks this has something to do with Devon's antics at school. Falcon asks whether Devon recognizes him and Devon says no. Once Devon sees the shoes, he knows Falcon is a bad guy and yells for his grandmother when Falcon leaves, who overhears Devon.Devon moves in with Nick for protection but Nick gets overwhelmed at the responsibility of caring for a kid so another cop who has kids gets Devon. The two are doing a radar trap and Fleming drives by 3 miles over the limit. Devon insists they stop him. The cop pulls over Fleming and Devon gets to issue the ticket. Fleming wants to explain his side to get out of the ticket but the 8-year-old with a badge repeats what Fleming told him at school: ""you will never learn and I will have done you a great injustice.""Falcon's boys see Devon walking back to the police car and try to run him down with their car. Nick sees them aiming for him from a distance and runs to push Devon out of the way ""just like Miami Vice."" Nick and Devon are partners again and roust a biker bar. Nick asks around looking for their suspect Bobo while Devon is having ""a milk ... in a dirty glass."" Bobo gets away on a motorcycle.The next morning Nick wakes up and finds Devon gone. Panicked, he runs outside asking if anyone's seen him. Up walks Devon who went to get donuts for breakfast. Nick yells at him for going off and Devon yells back that he doesn't want Nick to be his father or his partner and gets away from Nick. Devon ends up at school to get handcuffs from his locker and runs into the two bullies. Devon tells them that he is on police business. The bullies carry Devon to the playground and drops him into the sandbox as the other kids are coming out for recess. This time, Devon fights his way out using a technique he learned from Nick and handcuffs the bullies to the playground fence.Along comes Falcon's boys to the school looking for Devon. Devon gets the schoolyard kids to create a diversion so he could get away. But, Devon hides in their car. When Sanchez calls Devon on the walkie-talkie, they discover him.Falcon's boys take Devon back to the warehouse and Falcon where they plan to do away with him. Nick follows Bobo to the warehouse, bursts in and saves Devon and gets the crooks after a great boat chase.
