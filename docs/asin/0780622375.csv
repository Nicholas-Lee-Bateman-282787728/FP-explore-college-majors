31193,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,0780622375,Bobby Underwood,"[37, 40]","Patricia Arquette is excellent as a young woman numb with grief who slowly comes to terms with being left behind after her husband and young son are murdered in their home during a robbery. When she travels to Burma to vacation with her sister, Andy (Frances McDormand), she finds a country in as much pain as she is and slowly finds the purpose she so desparately needs. Based on actual events, John Boorman deftly weaves on a large loom the fine thread of Laura Bowman's intimate story with the thicker yarn of a country fighting for democracy.Laura (Arquette) and her sister, Andy (Frances McDormand), are on vacation in Burma, two American tourists enjoying a boat ride down a beautifully scenic river in Burma. Laura has been brought here by her sister in the hopes it will help her move forward after she has lost everything she loved. Though Laura seems stoic, there is tremendous pain just beneath the surface, emotions so strong she dare not let herself feel them. She has walked away from her life as a doctor because she could not heal herself and is drifting on a boat of sorrow.Boorman shows us a visually beautiful country, that like Arquette, has deep emotions just below the surface. One night in her hotel room Laura hears a demonstration in the streets and is drawn to it, witnessing firsthand the call for freedom as one woman fearlessly calls for democracy in the midst of soldiers sent to stop her. That woman is Aung Suu Kui (Adelle Lutz). The soldiers are, in a larger sense, her sons and brothers, and she bravely walks to them and lowers their weapons.When Laura is separated from her sister she forms a friendship with an elderly teacher and a group of young students who are seeking change. She learns of the government crackdown that has cost many their lives, as soldiers have fired into crowds of young students. Laura wonders why the world has not heard about this but learns that no photo journalists are allowed to send words or pictures outside of the country. Cut off from her family, Laura must make her way, along with the others, to Thailand, for safety. She will risk her life on more than one occasion as they make their way through the lush jungle and down the beautiful rivers of Rangoon.Laura has found a place for her grief to dwell as she has unknowingly come to a place where millions are grieving. A transformation occurs within Laura as she begins to live again, and in doing so starts the healing process. ""Beyond Rangoon"" is a film about the struggle for political change and the struggle within ourselves to find redemption. Arquette gives a subtle performance as Laura, dead on the surface, but filled with anguish underneath.Laura, who has begun to feel again, will make a decision at the end of this film that will alter the direction of her life forever. Travel down the beautiful waters of Irrawaddy with Arquette as she navigates her way through a river of grief, and discovers the reason she was left behind. It is a journey worth taking.",5,A River of Grief,1126828800,"09 16, 2005",2005,2996,"['Patricia', 'Arquette', 'excellent', 'young', 'woman', 'numb', 'grief', 'who', 'slowly', 'terms', 'being', 'left', 'husband', 'young', 'son', 'are', 'murdered', 'home', 'robbery', 'When', 'Burma', 'vacation', 'sister', 'Andy', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'country', 'as', 'much', 'pain', 'slowly', 'purpose', 'so', 'desparately', 'Based', 'actual', 'events', 'John', 'Boorman', 'deftly', 'large', 'loom', 'fine', 'thread', 'Laura', 'Bowman', 'intimate', 'story', 'thicker', 'yarn', 'country', 'fighting', 'democracy.Laura', 'Arquette', 'sister', 'Andy', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'are', 'vacation', 'Burma', 'two', 'American', 'tourists', 'enjoying', 'boat', 'ride', 'down', 'beautifully', 'scenic', 'river', 'Burma', 'Laura', 'been', 'brought', 'here', 'sister', 'hopes', 'will', 'help', 'move', 'forward', 'lost', 'everything', 'loved', 'Laura', 'stoic', 'tremendous', 'pain', 'just', 'surface', 'emotions', 'so', 'strong', 'not', 'let', 'feel', 'walked', 'away', 'life', 'doctor', 'could', 'not', 'heal', 'herself', 'drifting', 'boat', 'sorrow.Boorman', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'country', 'Arquette', 'deep', 'emotions', 'just', 'surface', 'One', 'night', 'hotel', 'room', 'Laura', 'demonstration', 'streets', 'drawn', 'witnessing', 'firsthand', 'call', 'freedom', 'one', 'woman', 'fearlessly', 'democracy', 'midst', 'soldiers', 'sent', 'stop', 'woman', 'Aung', 'Suu', 'Kui', 'Adelle', 'Lutz', 'soldiers', 'are', 'larger', 'sense', 'sons', 'brothers', 'bravely', 'walks', 'lowers', 'weapons.When', 'Laura', 'separated', 'sister', 'friendship', 'elderly', 'teacher', 'group', 'young', 'students', 'who', 'are', 'seeking', 'change', 'government', 'crackdown', 'cost', 'many', 'lives', 'soldiers', 'have', 'fired', 'crowds', 'young', 'students', 'Laura', 'wonders', 'why', 'world', 'not', 'heard', 'photo', 'journalists', 'are', 'allowed', 'send', 'words', 'pictures', 'country', 'Cut', 'off', 'family', 'Laura', 'must', 'make', 'way', 'others', 'Thailand', 'safety', 'will', 'risk', 'life', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'make', 'way', 'lush', 'jungle', 'beautiful', 'rivers', 'Rangoon.Laura', 'found', 'place', 'grief', 'dwell', 'unknowingly', 'come', 'place', 'where', 'millions', 'are', 'grieving', 'transformation', 'Laura', 'live', 'again', 'doing', 'so', 'healing', 'process', 'Beyond', 'Rangoon', 'film', 'struggle', 'political', 'change', 'struggle', 'find', 'redemption', 'Arquette', 'subtle', 'performance', 'Laura', 'dead', 'surface', 'filled', 'anguish', 'underneath.Laura', 'who', 'begun', 'feel', 'again', 'will', 'make', 'decision', 'end', 'film', 'will', 'alter', 'direction', 'life', 'forever', 'Travel', 'beautiful', 'waters', 'Irrawaddy', 'Arquette', 'way', 'river', 'grief', 'reason', 'was', 'left', 'behind', 'journey', 'worth', 'taking']",N/A
31194,A1S3C5OFU508P3,0780622375,Charles Ashbacher,"[0, 0]","Although the extent to which this movie is based on actual events is unclear, the overall theme clearly is. Myanmar (Burma) is a military dictatorship where the leaders maintain their rule through fear and terror. Opponents are jailed and executed and the military exists to keep their leaders in power, not to protect the country from external enemies.Laura Bowman is a young American doctor on a quest of forgetfulness, her husband and young son were murdered and she was the one that discovered their bodies. She has joined a group traveling to Burma and she witnesses a pro-democracy demonstration led by Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the opposition. The next day she barely avoids arrest and cannot find her passport. After going to the U. S. embassy, she is issued a temporary one and then comes into contact with a kindly former professor. The professor was forcibly removed from his post for aiding the pro-democracy movement and he is now conducting ad-hoc tours.Bowman goes out into the countryside and meets with a group of former students, learning what life is like in Burma. When they receive word that martial law has been declared, the professor tries to get her back to Rangoon. They encounter a military checkpoint and when the professor is being beaten, she gets him into a car and flees. The professor is shot and in a wild escape, she manages to rescue him, which is the start of an adventure in opposition. Bowman has now lost all of her apathy and is an active participant in standing up to the government while attempting to flee Burma.This movie is full of adventure and action for a purpose. While the specific events may not all be true, the overall theme of the oppression in Burma is. Recently, the overwhelming majority of the attention in the west has been focused on repression and suffering in Africa, specifically in Sudan. Yet, the oppression and suffering in Burma is also severe and this movie does a great deal to bring it to light.",5,Action and adventure with a purpose,1244332800,"06 7, 2009",2009,1972,"['extent', 'movie', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'unclear', 'overall', 'theme', 'clearly', 'Myanmar', 'Burma', 'military', 'dictatorship', 'where', 'leaders', 'maintain', 'rule', 'fear', 'terror', 'Opponents', 'are', 'jailed', 'executed', 'military', 'exists', 'keep', 'leaders', 'power', 'not', 'protect', 'country', 'external', 'enemies.Laura', 'Bowman', 'young', 'American', 'doctor', 'quest', 'forgetfulness', 'husband', 'young', 'son', 'were', 'murdered', 'was', 'one', 'discovered', 'bodies', 'joined', 'group', 'traveling', 'Burma', 'pro-democracy', 'demonstration', 'led', 'Aung', 'San', 'Suu', 'Kyi', 'leader', 'opposition', 'next', 'day', 'barely', 'arrest', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'passport', 'going', 'U.', 'S.', 'embassy', 'issued', 'temporary', 'one', 'then', 'contact', 'kindly', 'former', 'professor', 'professor', 'was', 'forcibly', 'removed', 'post', 'aiding', 'pro-democracy', 'movement', 'now', 'conducting', 'ad-hoc', 'tours.Bowman', 'out', 'countryside', 'meets', 'group', 'former', 'students', 'learning', 'what', 'life', 'Burma', 'When', 'receive', 'word', 'martial', 'law', 'been', 'declared', 'professor', 'get', 'back', 'Rangoon', 'encounter', 'military', 'checkpoint', 'when', 'professor', 'being', 'beaten', 'car', 'flees', 'professor', 'shot', 'wild', 'escape', 'rescue', 'start', 'adventure', 'opposition', 'Bowman', 'now', 'lost', 'apathy', 'active', 'participant', 'standing', 'up', 'government', 'attempting', 'flee', 'Burma.This', 'movie', 'full', 'adventure', 'action', 'purpose', 'specific', 'events', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'true', 'overall', 'theme', 'oppression', 'Burma', 'Recently', 'overwhelming', 'majority', 'attention', 'west', 'been', 'focused', 'repression', 'suffering', 'Africa', 'specifically', 'Sudan', 'oppression', 'suffering', 'Burma', 'also', 'severe', 'movie', 'great', 'deal', 'bring', 'light']",N/A

For example, there are no accounts of a white woman becoming so involved in the protests. Furthermore, it is a one-sided portrayal, casting the military as evil and opposition as all good - but that's not too far from the truth.The movie is at times corny, with stale acting and all too naive Burmese ""natives.""

31200,A3FLMB7VZ1KZBE,0780622375,Greg Allup,"[6, 7]","I am surprised that movies like Beyond Rangoon do not get much recognition out of Hollywood and the general public as it deserves.  It is movies like this that can open up people's eyes and appreciate for what they take for granted and also learn about another culture and its current politics in a country so little known to the west.  Myanmar(Burma) is a South East Asian country that has endured a very repressive military governemnt and has one of the world's worst civil rights records.  The country has not been at peace since it won its independence from the British in 1948.  Being isolated from the outside world for so long, not many people outside the Land of the Pagodas know of its people, culture, or even its existence.  Beyond Rangoon introduces the pro-democracy movement that shook the country in 1988 and uprooted thousands of Burmese citizens.  In watching this movie one will gain a reasonable understanding of Burma's political turmoil from the past to the pro-democracy movement of 1988 that seems to have eluded the world's attention.  At the time that I saw this movie on video, the July 1995 issue of National Geographic magazine published a wonderful article on Burma.  As I watched the movie I was also reading the article at the same time.  Everything in the article coincided and supported the events that were portrayed in the movie.

Slevin,"[11, 12]","Beyond Rangoon is an excellent movie for understanding the struggle between freedom and oppression.I happened to be on the Thai border in September of 1988 just prior to the massive movement of people across the border due to the response to Aung San Suu Kyi and her following.  I did not know that at the time.  All I remember is that on Thai TV a border war seemed to be starting and the road that I was driving on just the week before was being bombed by the Burmese.The story, although referring to the rebellion and some of those who fled, is more about Archette's character as she struggled to forget the death of her son and husband.  As a Doctor, she never took time to get away, and Rangoon seemed a place to be that was exotic.She takes a walk one very balmy evening only to see Aung San Suu Kyi and her followers walking enmasse on the street.  There is later the next day another protest, then things unravel and Archette, Dr. Laura Bowman, is forced to flee.The flight across the jungle is intense.  You actually feel the horror she feels, the close calls, yet, she is helped to flee by virtual strangers with a mutual desire to survive.This is an excellent movie as an introduction to Myanmar/Burmese history.  I have stayed on the border with some of the Karen peoples, whom you will be introduced to at the end of the movie.

While in Burma she gets caught  up in the ongoing struggle for democracy against the country's military  dictatorship, and along the way runs into an ex-professor who lost his  university position due to his support of that movement.But while a  well-intentioned movie it might be, it suffers from horrible acting and a  dreadful script. And the Burmese characters spout cliche after cliche  reminding us of their devotion to the great Buddha. If you ever manage to  forget that Burma is a Buddhist country while watching this movie then you  need only wait a few minutes. Which raises an interesting question about  how Hollywood treats non-whites in movies. White people constantly babbling  scripture are called fundamentalists and treated with some derision, Asians  or blacks or Indians who do so are called &quot;noble&quot;. Indigenous  peoples who aren't white are depicted lovingly and have movies like this  and &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; made about them.

For those of you unfamiliar with it, it is about a doctor whose grief from the senseless murder of her husband and son keeps her from practicing medicine.  Her sister takes her to Burma (Myanmar) to help her get away from her suffering.  While she is there, she gets caught in the clash between their harsh military dictatorship and nonviolent democracy movement.  As she struggles to get across the border to free and democratic Thailand, she learns how she is far from alone when it comes to grief and suffering.  She is finally ready to put her medical knowledge to good use again.  This movie really should be made available on DVD.  I hope it will be someday soon and, more importantly, I hope the people of Burma win their nonviolent struggle for democracy.

Why someone who had just lost her husband and son to murder would vacation there is beyond me. But let's not quibble about something that is minor compared to what is a sweeping and powerful qwest for freedom.The qwest for freedom in the movie is for Arquette, her Burmese friends, and for the Burmese people. Arquette is unwittingly dumped by Fate into harm's way, only to rediscover her own inner strength. The Burmese people have been living in harm's way for years under a brutal military regime. It takes all the inner strength they can muster to make it through each day. And for those who are truly brave, there may be opportunities to escape into Thailand.I won't go into detail on the plot. Suffice to say that I was greatly moved by the stories in the movie. I verified the horrible life faced by the Burmese people after watching this movie. I didn't know. We in the West live in ignorance of such horrifying human rights abuses. Burma's struggle is not on the news every night. These people largely suffer in silence.The movie probably tones it down quite a bit. The Burmese army routinely enscripts and brutalizes child labor to build roads (often for Western companies). The army routinely rapes women in villages around the country. And the army has systematically murdered adult men, particularly any man even thought to be in opposition to the dictatorship. Burma experiences the depths of evil everyday.We owe it to ourselves to watch such movies. They remind us of what man is capable of and what we must overcome. They remind us of the power we have to overcome.
