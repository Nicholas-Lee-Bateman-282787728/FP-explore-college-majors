243355,A1H4667RGGDVM5,6301017129,"A. Beseman ""Beezer""","[0, 0]",This Disney short won a well deserved Academy Award. I first saw this as a kid on the Disney &#34;Wonderful World of Color&#34; TV show and loved it [ this was in the same timeframe as their famous Man in Space trilogy]. Walt Disney was very interested in the popularization of science. And this was before the Space Race really took off. Donald Duck makes the perfect &#34;explorer&#34; character for the story. It makes the basics of math and the history of how mathematics developed very understandable and fun to learn. The graphics are fabulous as is the stories pacing. My daughter grew up with an old VHS copy of this and immediately asked for a DVD when I told her that I had ordered one from Amazon. She is a graduate artist and she also loves the art in this show. My granddaughter and grandson [both teenagers] also like this a lot and both learned stuff about math that they didn't lean in school.  I highly recommend this to anyone,5,A true Disney science classic,1369612800,"05 27, 2013",2013,944,"['Disney', 'short', 'won', 'well', 'deserved', 'Academy', 'Award', 'first', 'saw', 'kid', 'Disney', '34', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'Color', '34', 'TV', 'show', 'loved', '[', 'was', 'same', 'timeframe', 'famous', 'Man', 'Space', 'trilogy', ']', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'was', 'very', 'interested', 'popularization', 'science', 'was', 'Space', 'Race', 'really', 'took', 'off', 'Donald', 'Duck', 'perfect', '34', 'explorer', '34', 'character', 'story', 'basics', 'math', 'history', 'how', 'mathematics', 'developed', 'very', 'understandable', 'fun', 'learn', 'graphics', 'are', 'fabulous', 'stories', 'pacing', 'daughter', 'grew', 'up', 'old', 'VHS', 'copy', 'immediately', 'asked', 'DVD', 'when', 'told', 'had', 'ordered', 'one', 'Amazon', 'graduate', 'artist', 'also', 'art', 'show', 'granddaughter', 'grandson', '[', 'teenagers', ']', 'also', 'lot', 'learned', 'stuff', 'math', 'did', ""n't"", 'lean', 'school', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone']",N/A

I first saw this when I was still in Elementary School, and I didn't care too much about the subject (I did, however, found Donald Duck amusing). Now, I see it as a Disney classic, something that can entice just about everybody. Mathematics is still an unpopular subject in cartoons today, but Disney has made it interesting with Donald Duck and some vivid 50's animation. When you think of Donald Duck, you think of a talking duck with a tempestuous temper. But here, he's more relaxed (but still hilarious) and follows along with the history of mathematics and its uses. Paul Frees of Ludwig von Drake fame is the narrator, and he gives some pretty helpful info on how the human mind (and the entire world) is depended on numbers, shapes, and sizes. This one is truly special, folks. Nice music and animation, amusing ways to admire mathematics, and of course, Donald Duck. Donald in Mathmagic land is one huge treat.NOTE: Some people might be disappointed with this newly released DVD because it has no special features whatsoever.

243368,A3QAQUUPFIARWB,6301017129,"Gord Wilson ""alivingdog.com""","[26, 28]","One of the last four theatrical Donald Duck cartoons, Donald in Mathmagic Land didn't get the Academy Award for 1959, which went to John Hubley's Moonbird, but it was nominated for ""Best Documentary Short"". In retrospect, it's probably not only the best educational short of that year, but one of the best of any year. Hamilton Luske directed this lavish featurette, which despite clocking in at only 27 minutes, is filled with modernistic late '50s style art, dense and lavish color, and our favorite, irascible duck.Teachers loved to project this film for their classes, as it was so far above the host of now decently buried educational films of the time. This DVD opens with a montage trailer of scenes from the ""Wonderful World of Disney"" releases, which have the characteristic look of the four color Technicolor of the '60s, and that places this film in its rightful millieu. In his biography, former NBC head, Pat Weaver recalls that Disney offered NBC its film and TV catalog in the mid- '50s if NBC would buy a fourth of the then fledgling Disneyland Park. David Sarnoff, president of RCA, which owned NBC, flatly refused. The Disneyland TV show therefore continued on ABC, with a title change in the 1959 season to ""Walt Disney Presents"". Due to the runaway success of Davey Crockett, however, ABC wanted Walt to keep cranking out westerns, so in 1961, the program moved to NBC, with a new name many viewers remember, ""The Wonderful World of Color"".""General"" Sarnoff had made clear that RCA's one goal was to sell color TV sets, since most homes still had black and white, and ""Donald Duck in Mathmagic Land"" aired on its new network as part of an hour show hosted by a new character, Ludwig Von Drake, called ""An Adventure in Color"". I very much wish that had been included on this DVD, as not only is the program interesting in its own right, as well as a favorite of Von Drake fans, but it's a fascinating snapshot of the early days of color TV, as the mallard professor talks about color, with continual asides like ""you people with black and white sets will have to imagine what this looks like"". Then there's the theme song, ""The world is a carousel of color, color, color. Wonderful, wonderful color."" The accompanying slow motion nature shots made for an unforgettable, captivating entrance to the show, which segued to the magic paintbrush, the famous trademark of Disney educational films. Even in the days of black and white sets, Disney had farsightedly chosen to film in color.An early VHS release for video stores included the entire show, but so far, the other part hasn't made it to DVD. This shorter featurette, however, stands alone, and has far outlived most of the other animated shorts from the show. It's also on The Chronological Donald Volume Four. Some reviewers have noted that ten bucks might be a bit high for an under half hour show, and it would be nice to have some extras like interviews with animators or commentary on the short. However, anyone who's ever seen this film will probably just be happy to find it on DVD. There's also an ""enhanced"" teacher's edition for about $50. That may seem steep, but you get a ""printable teachers' guide"" and public performance license to show it in class, not unlike when educators of an earlier era would rush to rent the film reel from distributors, and it probably ranked as the most checked out educational film.The math in this film has been criticized, and some of it seems a bit of a stretch, but anyone interested in the Golden Section or Divine Proportion, as it is variously termed, or patterns in nature, or basic principles of how a guitar works likely first got the bug watching this show. Someone might even have hit the billiard hall armed with tricky shots from the film. Some of the chessboard and geometric shapes parts might seem more like an excuse to make some animation, but they are still entertaining, and this is not the only wildly speculative Disney film. If a few bits seem somewhat dated, that's all part of the fun of a period film, and for animation lovers, this one is a treasure trove. So in many ways, this bare-bones, budget edition is the best of all worlds, and will likely entice new viewers to join old fans on the well-trod path with Donald in Mathmagic Land.",5,The Wonderful World of Color,1250726400,"08 20, 2009",2009,4281,"['One', 'last', 'four', 'theatrical', 'Donald', 'Duck', 'cartoons', 'Donald', 'Mathmagic', 'Land', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Academy', 'Award', '1959', 'went', 'John', 'Hubley', 'Moonbird', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Documentary', 'Short', 'retrospect', 'probably', 'not', 'only', 'best', 'educational', 'short', 'year', 'one', 'best', 'year', 'Hamilton', 'Luske', 'directed', 'lavish', 'featurette', 'clocking', 'only', '27', 'minutes', 'filled', 'modernistic', 'late', ""'50s"", 'style', 'art', 'dense', 'lavish', 'color', 'favorite', 'irascible', 'duck.Teachers', 'loved', 'project', 'film', 'classes', 'was', 'so', 'far', 'host', 'now', 'decently', 'buried', 'educational', 'films', 'time', 'DVD', 'montage', 'trailer', 'scenes', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'Disney', 'releases', 'have', 'characteristic', 'look', 'four', 'color', 'Technicolor', ""'60s"", 'film', 'rightful', 'millieu', 'biography', 'former', 'NBC', 'head', 'Pat', 'Weaver', 'Disney', 'offered', 'NBC', 'film', 'TV', 'catalog', 'mid-', ""'50s"", 'NBC', 'would', 'buy', 'fourth', 'then', 'fledgling', 'Disneyland', 'Park', 'David', 'Sarnoff', 'president', 'RCA', 'owned', 'NBC', 'flatly', 'refused', 'Disneyland', 'TV', 'show', 'therefore', 'continued', 'ABC', 'title', 'change', '1959', 'season', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Presents', 'Due', 'runaway', 'success', 'Davey', 'Crockett', 'however', 'ABC', 'wanted', 'Walt', 'keep', 'cranking', 'westerns', 'so', '1961', 'program', 'moved', 'NBC', 'new', 'name', 'many', 'viewers', 'remember', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'Color', 'General', 'Sarnoff', 'had', 'made', 'clear', 'RCA', 'one', 'goal', 'was', 'sell', 'color', 'TV', 'sets', 'most', 'homes', 'still', 'had', 'black', 'white', 'Donald', 'Duck', 'Mathmagic', 'Land', 'aired', 'new', 'network', 'part', 'hour', 'show', 'hosted', 'new', 'character', 'Ludwig', 'Von', 'Drake', 'called', 'Adventure', 'Color', 'very', 'much', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'included', 'DVD', 'not', 'only', 'program', 'interesting', 'own', 'right', 'as', 'well', 'favorite', 'Von', 'Drake', 'fans', 'fascinating', 'snapshot', 'early', 'days', 'color', 'TV', 'mallard', 'professor', 'talks', 'color', 'continual', 'asides', 'people', 'black', 'white', 'sets', 'will', 'have', 'imagine', 'what', 'Then', 'theme', 'song', 'world', 'carousel', 'color', 'color', 'color', 'Wonderful', 'wonderful', 'color', 'accompanying', 'slow', 'motion', 'nature', 'shots', 'made', 'unforgettable', 'captivating', 'entrance', 'show', 'segued', 'magic', 'paintbrush', 'famous', 'trademark', 'Disney', 'educational', 'films', 'Even', 'days', 'black', 'white', 'sets', 'Disney', 'had', 'farsightedly', 'chosen', 'film', 'color.An', 'early', 'VHS', 'release', 'video', 'stores', 'included', 'entire', 'show', 'so', 'far', 'other', 'part', ""n't"", 'made', 'DVD', 'shorter', 'featurette', 'however', 'alone', 'far', 'outlived', 'most', 'other', 'animated', 'shorts', 'show', 'also', 'Chronological', 'Donald', 'Volume', 'Four', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'ten', 'bucks', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'high', 'half', 'hour', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'have', 'extras', 'interviews', 'animators', 'commentary', 'short', 'However', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'just', 'be', 'happy', 'find', 'DVD', 'also', 'enhanced', 'teacher', 'edition', '50', 'may', 'seem', 'steep', 'get', 'printable', 'teachers', 'guide', 'public', 'performance', 'license', 'show', 'class', 'not', 'when', 'educators', 'earlier', 'era', 'would', 'rush', 'rent', 'film', 'reel', 'distributors', 'probably', 'ranked', 'most', 'checked', 'out', 'educational', 'film.The', 'math', 'film', 'been', 'criticized', 'bit', 'stretch', 'anyone', 'interested', 'Golden', 'Section', 'Divine', 'Proportion', 'variously', 'termed', 'patterns', 'nature', 'basic', 'principles', 'how', 'guitar', 'likely', 'first', 'got', 'bug', 'watching', 'show', 'Someone', 'might', 'even', 'have', 'hit', 'billiard', 'hall', 'armed', 'tricky', 'shots', 'film', 'chessboard', 'geometric', 'shapes', 'parts', 'might', 'seem', 'more', 'excuse', 'make', 'animation', 'are', 'still', 'entertaining', 'not', 'only', 'wildly', 'speculative', 'Disney', 'film', 'few', 'bits', 'seem', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'part', 'fun', 'period', 'film', 'animation', 'lovers', 'one', 'treasure', 'trove', 'So', 'many', 'ways', 'bare-bones', 'budget', 'edition', 'best', 'worlds', 'will', 'likely', 'entice', 'new', 'viewers', 'join', 'old', 'fans', 'well-trod', 'path', 'Donald', 'Mathmagic', 'Land']",N/A
