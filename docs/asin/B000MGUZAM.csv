As a friend of mine once said about Mississippi John Hurt, if you don't like this movie you've got a hole in your soul.Of course, it doesn't hurt to have arguably America's greatest actor - Morgan Freeman - on your team.  The film is a showcase for him - he stars, and executive produced.  More to the point, he is playing (almost) himself.  Of course the irony here is that for most actors that would be the one impossible role - they can play anyone BUT themselves.  Freeman is so thoroughly comfortable and comforting - the avuncular persona and lush voice - that we never question any of the improbabilities and simply drift into this thoroughly odd and quirky reality.Writer, director, and co-producer Brad Silberling is to be highly commended for a smart, funny, and touching script that came alive on the screen.  The brief appearance of Bobby Cannavale reminded me of a similar movie, Station Agent, which has the same quiet confidence, dry wit, and warmth.  There is no plot worthy of the name, everything rests on the chemistry between Scarlet, the exquisite Paz Vega, and Freeman - and there's enough to burn down the science building.  The fulcrum here is the concept of intersecting lives - and how - in a rare moment of unexpected intimacy and honesty - people can connect and give of themselves generously, with no expectation of return.  It is exquisite.Morgan as the helpless star, Vega as the tough-minded checkout cashier is such a hilariously improbable pairing that something good must come of it.

And it's nice to see when a director/script get it right. Clocking in at just 82 minutes, 10 ITEMS OR LESS doesn't stretch the story, trying to grasp at inane topics. It stays focused, being funny, sad, and well thought out.Morgan Freeman (Lucky Number Slevin) stars as ""Him"", an aging actor grasping at any roles presented to him. We're introduced to ""Him"" as he travels to a supermarket in an out-of-the-way section of town by The Kid (Jonah Hill,Click). Realizing he has a star in his car, The Kid pressures Him to talk about his absence in cinema over the past few years. Him isn't very forthcoming because, not only has he been out of it for while, he's also en route to a shooting location of an indie film he might act in (""I haven't decided if I'm going to accept the part.""). The Kid is a relative of the director involved in this indie venture and soon drops him in the middle of nowheresville. Stuck, Him decides to check out the local market. He immediately runs into the beautiful Scarlet (Paz Vega,Spanglish) who operates the 10 items or less register. Not just strikingly pretty but intelligent, Him begins using her as his prime research subject for his upcoming independent film role. He learns how she figures out numbers so quickly and why she knows the quirks of every member of this isolated community.But Him doesn't just use Scarlet, he helps her so he can see deeper into her life. They travel together to get her car back from a cheating husband, and he teaches her how to act to get a new job she's pining for, and how to dress for success even when confronted with Target as the epitome of local clothing. This is probably one of the funniest moments as we get a glimpse of Him, too, showing his complete lack of understanding of the chain-store retail world (""These shirts are only $12 bucks! How is this possible?!"")The ending, as stated at the beginning of this review, is abrupt but apropos. There's no way these two could ever remain friends even though they form a unique bond. They know when to say goodbye and what each garnered from the other. It's a quiet but riveting moment as Scarlet's clunker car sits idling outside Him's L.A. mansion.This is a great independent production and one that wastes little time getting going.

Taking place almost entirely in various, non-descript spots in southern Los Angeles, the story itself is inconsequential, but like Sofia Coppola'sLost in Translation, the film is far more about two strangers who meet unexpectedly, find a common bond and go back to their lives enlightened for the momentous encounter. It also helps considerably that Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are playing the characters. Finally freed of the wise sages and authority figures beyond reproach that have become his big-screen specialty, Freeman seems comparatively liberated as a somewhat self-indulgent movie star. His character is driven to a low-rent grocery store in Carson, where he will be able to research a role he is considering in an indie film.Out of work for a few years, he is embarrassed when he sees DVDs of his films in the bargain bin, but his ego is such that he does not lack the temerity to watch and even mimic the enervated store staff. Of particular fascination to him is Scarlet, an embittered worker from Spain and relegated to the express line where she is the unsung model of efficiency. She has an interview for a secretarial job at a construction company, but her deep-seeded insecurity seems to defeat her chances already. Still looking like Penelope Cruz's Amazonian sister, the beautiful Vega (one of the few redeemable aspects of James L. Brooks' execrableSpanglish) brings a stinging edge and realistic vulnerability to Scarlet. She and Freeman interplay very well throughout the story, which includes stops not only at the grocery store but also at Target, Arby's and a full-service carwash. Nothing earth-shattering happens except to show how two people realize the resonating transience of chance encounters.Director/screenwriter Brad Silberling keeps the proceedings simple, but the production also reflects expert craftsmanship in Phedon Papamichael's vibrant cinematography (he lensed Alexander Payne'sSideways) and the infectious score by Brazilian composer Antonio Pinto (City of God). There are fast cameos by Bobby Cannavale (as Scarlet's soon-to-be-ex-husband) and as themselves, Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman, as well as funny bits with Jonah Hill (Knocked Up) as the clueless driver and Jim Parsons (the ""knight"" inGarden State) as a worshipful receptionist. The 2007 DVD is overstuffed with extras, including a making-of documentary, ""15 Days or Less"", aimed at film students and running a marathon 103 minutes; six extended scenes; a light-hearted but insightful three-way conversation between Silberling, Freeman and Vega in the middle of Target; and a couple of snippets that specifically advertise the DVD.",4,Yet Another Brief Encounter Yields Two Smart Performances in a Deceptively Casual Fable,1185062400,"07 22, 2007",2007,2807,"['Running', 'only', 'seventy-two', 'minutes', 'small', 'overlooked', '2006', 'dramedy', 'really', 'just', 'two-character', 'sketch', 'piece', 'one', 'very', 'well', 'limitations', 'Taking', 'place', 'almost', 'entirely', 'various', 'non-descript', 'spots', 'southern', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'story', 'inconsequential', 'Sofia', ""Coppola'sLost"", 'Translation', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'two', 'strangers', 'who', 'meet', 'unexpectedly', 'find', 'common', 'bond', 'go', 'back', 'lives', 'enlightened', 'momentous', 'encounter', 'also', 'considerably', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Paz', 'Vega', 'are', 'playing', 'characters', 'Finally', 'freed', 'wise', 'sages', 'authority', 'figures', 'reproach', 'have', 'become', 'big-screen', 'specialty', 'Freeman', 'comparatively', 'liberated', 'somewhat', 'self-indulgent', 'movie', 'star', 'character', 'driven', 'low-rent', 'grocery', 'store', 'Carson', 'where', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'research', 'role', 'considering', 'indie', 'film.Out', 'work', 'few', 'years', 'embarrassed', 'when', 'DVDs', 'films', 'bargain', 'bin', 'ego', 'such', 'not', 'lack', 'temerity', 'watch', 'even', 'mimic', 'enervated', 'store', 'staff', 'particular', 'fascination', 'Scarlet', 'embittered', 'worker', 'Spain', 'relegated', 'express', 'line', 'where', 'unsung', 'model', 'efficiency', 'interview', 'secretarial', 'job', 'construction', 'company', 'deep-seeded', 'insecurity', 'defeat', 'chances', 'already', 'Still', 'looking', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'Amazonian', 'sister', 'beautiful', 'Vega', 'one', 'few', 'redeemable', 'aspects', 'James', 'L.', 'Brooks', 'execrableSpanglish', 'stinging', 'edge', 'realistic', 'vulnerability', 'Scarlet', 'Freeman', 'interplay', 'very', 'well', 'story', 'stops', 'not', 'only', 'grocery', 'store', 'also', 'Target', 'Arby', 'full-service', 'carwash', 'Nothing', 'earth-shattering', 'happens', 'show', 'how', 'two', 'people', 'realize', 'resonating', 'transience', 'chance', 'encounters.Director/screenwriter', 'Brad', 'Silberling', 'proceedings', 'simple', 'production', 'also', 'expert', 'craftsmanship', 'Phedon', 'Papamichael', 'vibrant', 'cinematography', 'lensed', 'Alexander', ""Payne'sSideways"", 'infectious', 'score', 'Brazilian', 'composer', 'Antonio', 'Pinto', 'City', 'God', 'are', 'fast', 'cameos', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'Scarlet', 'soon-to-be-ex-husband', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'Rhea', 'Perlman', 'as', 'well', 'funny', 'bits', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'clueless', 'driver', 'Jim', 'Parsons', 'knight', 'inGarden', 'State', 'worshipful', 'receptionist', '2007', 'DVD', 'overstuffed', 'extras', 'including', 'making-of', 'documentary', '15', 'Days', 'Less', 'aimed', 'film', 'students', 'running', 'marathon', '103', 'minutes', 'six', 'extended', 'scenes', 'light-hearted', 'insightful', 'three-way', 'conversation', 'Silberling', 'Freeman', 'Vega', 'middle', 'Target', 'couple', 'snippets', 'specifically', 'advertise', 'DVD']",10 Items or Less

Not just any actor can do that. An incredible amount of the humor is from Vega, sadly more than half of it due to her uproarious Spanish accent.More's the pity there: Vega is an up-and-coming star, if she can lessen the accent.

Silberling had the good fortune to pair veteran actor Morgan Freeman, in between his big projects, with Spanish actress Paz Vega, and the result is a dialogue between two people from different vantages who manage to enhance the life of the other.Morgan Freeman plays himself - yet part of the comedy is that he is depicted as an actor who has been out of work for four years, scouting a location for a little 'filler film' to get back into the flow of things.  His 'role' is to be that of a market manager and he is dropped off at seedy market in Carson where he encounters, among others, one Scarlet, the girl at the argumentative 10 Items or Less checkout line. Not only is Scarlet tired of her static job, she is also generally angry about her philandering husband (Bobby Cannavale), currently sleeping with Scarlet's lazy co-worker (Anne Dudek), and her lack of ability to get a decent job elsewhere.  The two pair after a few shared problems and off they go on a 'road trip' that results in each of the characters growing from the presence and life story of the other.It is a simple story, simply told, but because of the tender bonding between Freeman and Paz it works very well.  This is one of those little films about human relationships where being vulnerable to change and exchange is the message.  It is well worth viewing, and this is a DVD that has featurettes that are touching, informative, and comic - a pleasure to view.

No, this is not a parody of the recent political campaign. It is the story of an out-of-work, but still famous, actor dropped off by an airhead driver at a neighborhood grocery in the midst of Carson, California, which looks like an run down town, to research a role in a potential independent film. Freeman is in a slough of self-doubt and despair. When he sees copies of his old movies being heavily discounted on DVD, he buries them deep in the display.He meets Paz Vega, who mans - er, womans - the ""10 Items Or Less"" lane. She is brash, angry, frustrated, wrapped up in a lousy marriage where her husband's lover works in the same store, is convinced that life is a dead end.Freeman and Vega form an unlikely alliance. He has no way to find his way back home to Brentwood - a highly unlikely experience - and she has to go to an interview that she is convinced will get her nowhere.Thus begins a series of light adventure in which both Freeman and Vega expand their horizons.This is a fun, light film. Freeman is Freeman playing Freeman and, unsurprisingly, he does it quite well. He waltzes through his scenes with an appealing lightness. Vega works hard as the bitter woman looking for a better life, while she is sure that she is not entitled to anything more than life in the ""10 items or less"" lane.The ending is pleasing.

In the case of10 Items or Lessthe movie was filmed in 15 days. The locations were Carson and Brentwood, CA. And a good deal of the story takes place in Archie's Ranch Market, Target, and a car wash. And this is one of the best films to come along - well - in a long time!Morgan Freeman portrays a nameless (but very recognizable) actor who hasn't worked in four years. He's considering a part, as a store manager, for an independent film. Feeling the need to research this part before committing to the role, Freeman's character is dropped off at a Carson grocery market. And this is where he meets the ""10 Items or Less"" checkout girl, Scarlet Morales, played by the incomparable Paz Vega. They wind up spending a serendipitous day together. Their lives couldn't be more different, but they share a congruity. Both are somewhat trapped by their own intertia. The actor hasn't stepped beyond Brentwood in a long while and Scarlet hasn't stepped out of Carson.Freeman's character is stranded with no cash - just a Diner's Club card (Thank you, Diner's Club). He can't remember his own phone number. Scarlet is the sharp, practical and pragmatic one and once she retrieves her Gremlin from estranged husband/store manager, they are in business.What makes this movie amazing is the bond that forms between the actor and Scarlet. She has an job interview scheduled later that day. The actor puts his desire to get home on hold to help Scarlet prepare for the ""audition.""It's worth the price of admission when you come to the scene in Target. The actor has never stepped foot into a discount department store. His first comment is ""This is amazing."" Scarlet responds sardonically, ""It's Target.""The carwash scene is the next gem-he decides Scarlet's Gremlin needs some spiffing up before she pulls up for the interview. Whether it's the carwash, Target, or even Arby's, Freeman's character has a wonderful way of engaging people and Scarlet adds that sense of grounded reality. Each learn something from the other.Another scene to watch for involves Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman near the end of the movie.The soundtrack (which unfortunately is not available) is kick-butt to say the least.

It's all about two people whose lives briefly touch and who make a touching, unlikely connection.There are a few too many quirks ladled into these characters' behavior to make them truly believable. Morgan Freeman plays an actor whose career is lagging and who therefore has agreed to star in the very indie film of a Hollywood newcomer. Freeman is chauffeured out to the limbo of a grocery store set in an improbably desolate industrial parking lot area, so that he can study a real store manager in preparation for his movie role. It's hard to imagine that any actor, however flagging his career, would take the time to venture off on such a goofy course of study.Then Freeman is given the odd habit of clutching at the napes of passersby in order to sneak a peek at their clothing labels and check them for fabric content. Who does that? That is a bizarre eccentricity that the scriptwriters truly dragged in by the mohair.There is also something rather unconvincing about the behavior of the young check-out clerk whom Freeman befriends. She moves from being a sullen, skeptical girl with a chaotic personal life, to being an open, heartfelt woman of calm philosophy. That sort of quick transformation is hardly believable.Still, there is something appealing about this movie.

She's been a checker for 6 years, no upwardly mobile prospects,and  as she says, ""never had a job where I could sit down.""In the wealthier parts of town, where Scarlet visibly feels completely out of place,and walking to the enormous, intimidating ""temple"" building of the construction receptionist job, you know she'd have cut and run if ""Him"" wasn't there to give her moral courage. He stands behind her just for that reason, that she can't turn and chicken out.Morgan Freeman is excellent as usual. He knows when to tone down his acting just as he gets a little too close to mugging and being full of himself, but aren't all actors full of themselves? He can afford to be what with his phenomenal talent and success. He looks like he'd just be a blast to hang out with! And in his early 70's, he looks 53-54 years old, tops! He doesn't have the old person mentality; he's still full of life in his later years. We can never get enough of Morgan.The only problem with this movie was the sexual innuendos towards Scarlet. You could see her face sag when Him brought up the subject, like she thought Him liked her for her, but he's kind of crossing the line to see how she reacts to talk of sex. All women have been here. It can hurt our feelings when it appears all a man wants from us is sex, not friendship. I got a little uncomfortably squirmy like Scarlet.That aside, when Scarlet walks out of the interview,shoulders straight and confident,  she is visibly a different person, having done what terrified her beyond belief. We don't know if she got that job, but we know she'll go somewhere else and do it again until she succeeds. That's the invaluable gift Him's character. Her gift to Him is that even though he's a long faded star,seeing the struggles of the lower working class, he realizes he has a whole lot more to be grateful for than he thought.The wonderful music score features an infectious Latin cha-cha-cha piece that will stick in your brain for days! Loved the carwash scene!!Silberling is a wonderful comic director, so subtle, yet his sight gags make you laugh out loud. Nothing over the top stupid and juvenile as we see so much of anymore. His approach to comedy has more of an understated European flair than the pathetic American style. Make more comedies, Mr. Silberling!So far I've probably watched this little gem 10 times!P.S.

These two are a couple of likeable characters who find themselves thrown together for a few hours because she needs to go on a job interview and he doesn't have a ride home.The rest of the movie is just sort of a day-in-the-life of these two souls as they accomplish simple tasks, like going to Target for a new blouse for her, or getting her car washed, or eating a take-out meal.  The blouse is quite revealing, by the way, and will provide gentleman admirers of Ms. Vega with an eyeful.There are no car chases, gun fights or explosions.  There is an off-screen fight between Ms. Vega and her estranged husband (a dispute over car keys) which sounds as though it may result in a physical injury to him of some sort, but we are not sure what it is that she has done to him.Mr. Freeman is charming, as ever, but not much of an English accent - that's OK, as I don't really expect it from Americans anymore.I really enjoyed the soundtrack, too - a nice old Paul Simon song throughout the final sequence.",4,Unexpected and Likeable,1190332800,"09 21, 2007",2007,1163,"['little', 'movie', 'nowhere', 'moderate', 'pace.Morgan', 'Freeman', 'actor', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Paz', 'Vega', 'ranch', 'market', 'check-out', 'cashier', 'two', 'are', 'couple', 'likeable', 'characters', 'who', 'find', 'thrown', 'together', 'few', 'hours', 'go', 'job', 'interview', ""n't"", 'have', 'ride', 'home.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'just', 'sort', 'day-in-the-life', 'two', 'souls', 'accomplish', 'simple', 'tasks', 'going', 'Target', 'new', 'blouse', 'getting', 'car', 'washed', 'eating', 'take-out', 'meal', 'blouse', 'quite', 'revealing', 'way', 'will', 'provide', 'gentleman', 'admirers', 'Ms.', 'Vega', 'are', 'car', 'chases', 'gun', 'fights', 'explosions', 'off-screen', 'fight', 'Ms.', 'Vega', 'estranged', 'husband', 'dispute', 'car', 'keys', 'may', 'result', 'physical', 'injury', 'sort', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'done', 'him.Mr', 'Freeman', 'charming', 'ever', 'not', 'much', 'English', 'accent', 'OK', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'expect', 'Americans', 'anymore.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'soundtrack', 'too', 'nice', 'old', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'song', 'final', 'sequence']",10 Items or Less
