Wisely avoiding an international firestorm of hatred, Mr. Kingsley's narration sensitively pulled every punch that might have reflected poorly on the topic at hand.  The international commentators produced a thin veneer of scholarly analysis without all the tiresome strife that questioning, debate, and independent thought sometimes cause.

581820,A2U8V7XK1X4ACD,B00005I9P1,"Anno ""tookson""","[63, 97]","I just finished watching this entire *ahem* historical documentary, and I will never be able to get back the three hours of my life I spent watching this video.Islam: Empire of Faith is propaganda pure and simple and in its most transparent form. The few ""scholars"" who are endlessly quoted in this video actually said the following:1.  When Mohammed and his followers conquered the cities and nations that they conquered in the early Islamic expansion of their religion, the conquered peoples didn't really fight back that hard because they were all tired of being oppressed by the local priest classes and were ready for a major religious change.  (No mention at all of blood shed, carnage, or anything unpleasant like that in the advancement of Islam.)2.  The Muslims actually invented the scientific method. (Sorry ancient Greece, I guess your ancient scrolls are just a Western forgery.)3.  [This one kills me] The Muslims actually invented the aqueduct.  I am not kidding, they said it in this video! Ancient Rome I guess didn't do it hundreds of years before Mohammed was even born. Who knew?4.  A Muslim Harem is defined as:  ""A system designed to produce heirs.""You will learn nothing about Islamic teachings in the three hours of watching this film.  What are the five pillars of Islam? This film only mentions that there are five pillars of Islam, but never tells you what they are.At the end of this video you will think that Christians are barbaric, weak, impoverished, and the West is insignificant in the advancement of science, art and culture.Muslim rulers only attacked their neighbors ""because they had no choice.""Not a single negative word is spoken against Islam or its rulers throughout history. It was as if an Al Queda terrorist was standing just outside the camera's view pointing a gun at the head of each commentator as they spoke into the camera.  And contrast that to how PBS treats Christians and Christendom in other installments of their Empire series. They accuse Martin Luther of being a neurotic big baby.I learned more about PBS in watching this video than I did about Islam. PBS I now know really stands for ""Pure B.S.""There must be better historical documentaries about Islam out there.

We don't hear anything about what has been in the news lately, or anything else from the twentieth-century. Couldn't they have at least covered such important events such as the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire, the rise of the House of Saud, Iranians in rebellion, etc?2)The film gives undue treatment to imperial powers, at the expense of discussing Islam outside of the Middle East. The majority of Muslims in the world today live in Asia, but there is next to nothing about them here. Also, Persia is given a short treatment, but I was really curious about the Safavids and how they came to power. Furthermore, there was no discussion of the Mughal Empire, so we lack any perspective on Islam in India.3)The treatment is sanitized. Muslims always seem ""good,"" while Christians are treated as ""bad."" This is just as frustrating as the traditional line portraying Muslim culture as ""lacking"" civilization.4)Great editing and camerawork kept me involved in scenes which I normally would probably have tuned out.5)I recommend this film for people new to studying Islam or the Middle East(or, for that matter, the modern world), as long as the above guidelines are taken into account.",3,O.K.

581825,A2KG8WLR1AKO12,B00005I9P1,"David Thomson ""Second Rate Eric Hoffer Imitator""","[9, 14]","I enjoyed, as far as it goes, Islam: Empire of Faith.  One learns about the educational and cultural advances of the Islamic empires from 7th Century to the latter half of the 16th.  During this time period the Muslim world valued secular learning and modern technology.  It established hospitals and mammoth libraries unheard of in the Christian West.  A certain degree of religious toleration even existed.  The film producers, however, could have spent more time regarding the second class status of women---but the West admittedly was not doing much better in this regard.  No, the problem is that this documentary study did not continue into the 17th Century when everything started to rapidly fall apart.  Anti-intellectualism and ludditism started to become the norm.  At times, a number of Islamic adherents even embraced a nihilistic interpretation of the their faith.  Life is supposedly an awful thing and death is preferable.  The previously backward West even surpassed the Muslims to the point of utter embarrassment.What has the Islamic world accomplished in the last 400 to 500 years?  The more affluent Muslims are compelled to send their children to the West to obtain a good education.  Islamic dominated universities are usually nothing more than a joke.  You should make a point to view this fine series.  Immediately afterwards, you must read Bernard Lewis's What Went Wrong?: Western Impact and Middle Eastern Response.

Kaminski ""j_s_k""","[6, 10]","""Islam-Empire of Faith"" provides a decent history of the birth and spread of Islam, but some glaring omissions make the program somewhat disappointing.  The first episode covers the life and career of Muhammed, as it should, but only a brief mention is made of the split in Islam that occurred after his death.  The followers of Muhammed couldn't decide who should lead the people: a blood relative or the most capable person.  So Islam split into two factions, the Shia and the Sunni.  As I don't know much about the differences, I was hoping this program would go into more details, but it doesn't.  A definite missed opportunity.The 2nd episode covers the spread of Islam throughout the Middle East and North Africa, but does not mention that these were conquests of people and lands.  If one did not know better, one might think this was a peaceful conversion of towns and cities to the Islamic empire, but this is not so.  It was a military conquest, just like any other.Also, the Muslims are held up as the great thinkers of their time, and for the most part they were, but there are some black eyes here too.  A Muslim was responsible for the destruction of the Great Library in Alexandria, which housed treasures that will never be recovered again.  A great literary loss.One issue the program does cover is that the ""spark"" that caused the Crusades actually began with a Muslim.  The ""mayor"" of Jerusalem ordered the destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the early 1100s, and it was this act that created the mistrust between Christian and Muslim.

Its purpose seems to be to emphasize the positive and eliminate the negative perceptions of Islam, while doing the reverse for Christianity. For example, one of the interviewees stated that the first Crusade was a response to the burning of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem in 1005 by the Caliph whom she described as ""[only] one mad man."" This is difficult to accept because the first Crusade was in 1095, 90 years later. There is no mention of the Crusades as a possible response to Muslim aggression. As another reviewer here noted, if Islam is a religion of peace, how did it get from Medina in 632 AD to ruling the Mid East and much of Eastern Europe and Spain by 1300 AD -  by preaching on street corners?While there has undoubtedly been violence by both Christians and Moslems, this work conveniently overlooks the fact that Christians committing violence must act contrary to their founder's commands, while Moslems must merely emulate theirs.Here are some of the less glorious aspects of Islam and Islamic history you will not learn about in this piece of propaganda that PBS has obviously allowed some Islamic PR group or other to approve, if not produce altogether:Jihad -""holy war"" to spread the dominion of Islam;Dhimmihood -the way conquered un-believers are to be treated (worse than Jim Crow treated blacks);Women - how Islamic law treats women;Slavery - How slavery has been legal all through Islamic history down to the present day.""Misconceptions about the Crusades are all too common. The Crusades are generally portrayed as a series of holy wars against Islam led by power-mad popes and fought by religious fanatics. They are supposed to have been the epitome of self-righteousness and intolerance, a black stain on the history of the Catholic Church in particular and Western civilization in general. A breed of proto-imperialists, the Crusaders introduced Western aggression to the peaceful Middle East and then deformed the enlightened Muslim culture, leaving it in ruins.

581844,AX9FLAFCVP2FB,B00005I9P1,"William Alexander ""Bill Alexander""","[370, 438]","First the good.  This DVD is incredibly beautiful and Kingsley's voice is absolutely marvelous, he should narrate more documentaries.  The grand sweep of Islamic history is presented in a succinct and eloquent manner, with accompanying visuals that are captivating.  The story begins in the 6th century CE with the message of Muhammad's strict monotheism.  Struggling to gain a foothold in Arabia, he eventually is victorious, conquers Mecca and gains thousands of followers.  In one of the most spectacular rises of civilization in the history of man, Islam spreads its faith for thousands of miles from Western Europe to Central Asia.  Muhammad's message is simple and profound, he unites the various Arab tribes into one cohesive group under the banner of one God, smashing idols and reciting God's words along the way.  Muhammad co-opted one of the greatest innovations of man:  the immense power of monotheism and its ability to unite disparate groups of people under a common polity and society.  The new Arabic empire spreads rapidly throughout the peninsula, the Levant, Egypt, the Maghrib, Spain, Persia.There is absolutely no doubt that Islamic civilization during the Middle Ages was spectacular, rich, and more advanced than European civilization.  They preserved Greek philosophy and expanded upon it, developed geometry and discovered trigonometry, and adapted Indian numerals to a decimal system, greatly advancing mathematics.  Art and architecture under the empire was simply stunning, breathtakingly beautiful.  Muslims also developed an anatomy that was used for centuries afterward by Europe, discovered inoculation and formed the precursor to modern hospitals.  The Islamic empire was so rich and powerful it became a great threat to Christian Europe, who responded with the Crusades.  Over one hundred years of conflict ensues in the Levant, until Saladin re-conquers and ends the Crusading campaigns.  The account of the Crusades is short, and not historically complete.  It is also quite biased in its presentation of details.The rise and spread of the Ottoman Empire is narrated in the third installment.  Their power, spread into Europe, their great architecture, and their antagonism with the Iranian Safavid Empire are all included.  By far the best part of this DVD is its telling of the life of Suleyman the Magnificent.  He was certainly an extraordinary ruler and he receives his due attention in this documentary.Now the bad.  This production is quite biased, sometimes subtly in its choice of pictures, other times not so subtly in its choice of language.  What you will not hear about is the gruesome nature of the Arabic conquest.  While, according to this documentary the Muslims were led by a noble faith in God, the truth is many people were slaughtered in the conquests.  Many thousands of Zoroastrian Persians were slaughtered; the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) were allowed to maintain their faith, but were subject to a special Muslim toll tax that did not apply to Muslims.  They also were not allowed to proselytize, and their legal testimony was not as valid as their Muslim overlords.  Many people were given only three options:  conversion, death, or slavery.  All peoples have conquered and slaughtered the Other; neither Muslims nor Christians are exempt from such behavior.  Nonetheless, some Christians received more toleration than they had had under the Byzantine Empire.  But the fact of the matter is that modern religious toleration was birthed in the European Enlightenment, not in the Middle East or West Asia.  Muslims did develop much philosophy and learning, however many of the scholars working in Cordoba and Baghdad were Jews and Christians, albeit studying in peaceful cooperation with the Muslims.  Paper was discovered via Chinese slaves brought into the empire, and the slave trade formed an integral part of the economy of the Muslim lands.  Although Muslims did not invent slavery, which has been around since the dawn of civilization, they did innovate the African slave trade.  Several times we hear about Europe ""languishing in the Dark Ages"".  No serious historian uses the term Dark Ages anymore, as the past decades have revealed a much more complex and intellectually interesting history.  The term has been abandoned for the more appropriate Middle Ages, being as it is the bridge between the ancient and modern worlds.A great oversight is its short shrift of Iran.  Iran is one of the centers of Islamic civilization, the center of Shiism, and a complex and interesting culture.  The glory of the Safavid Empire and the beauty of its capital Isfahan are briefly mentioned, but there is no word on Shah Abbas, Iran's ruler at the height of this empire.Also, this DVD focuses on politics, not religion.  You will not gain a deep understanding of the myriad forms of Islamic faith in this documentary, certainly a key point of interest for some individuals.  The Sufi dervishes were only very briefly mentioned, which is a shame because Sufism is a fascinating expression of Islamic mysticism, looked at with great suspicion by more conservative Muslims.  Neither will you hear much detail about the schism between the Sunni and Shiites.  The roots of this split are told, but the theological differences are not discussed.  It was the development of Shiism that was a great impetus for the conversion of the Zoroastrian Persians to Islam, as it incorporated Zoroastrian ideas, merging the Saoshyant with the Hidden Imam to be revealed in later times.So, it's biased, but extremely beautiful and informative.  This could have been a four or five star documentary, but because of its political correctness it gets three.",3,Quite good and quite biased,1072742400,"12 30, 2003",2003,5707,"['First', 'good',

The approach is a bit staid, which isn't unusual given that it's a PBS documentary. However it still provides a lot of information - information one rarely gets outside of academic circles - and as such serves as a kind of balance for the highly negative view of Islamic culture that predominates in the West. That said I do agree with those that point out that the parallel development of Shi'ite culture doesn't get enough treatment, and one could argue that Americans really need a good, reliable and balanced picture of that world, explaining the roots of Shi'ite resentment against the West. And to those who argue that this documentary wasn't sufficiently pejorative I would say that with so much anti-Muslim material in the media, there's a greater need for media like this, to give us all a bigger picture, from which to form our own opinions on how to regard the Muslim world today.",3,"staid, purposefully stilted, but informative.",1225411200,"10 31, 2008",2008,1030,"['Colorful', 'informative', 'Islam', 'Empire', 'Faith', 'really', 'major', 'branch', 'Islamic', 'Civilization', 'less', 'Islam', 'faith', 'approach', 'bit', 'staid', ""n't"", 'unusual', 'given', 'PBS', 'documentary', 'However', 'still', 'lot', 'information', 'information', 'one', 'rarely', 'academic', 'circles', 'such', 'serves', 'kind', 'balance', 'highly', 'negative', 'view', 'Islamic', 'culture', 'West', 'said', 'do', 'agree', 'point', 'out', 'parallel', 'development', ""Shi'ite"", 'culture', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'treatment', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'Americans', 'really', 'need', 'good', 'reliable', 'balanced', 'picture', 'world', 'explaining', 'roots', ""Shi'ite"", 'resentment', 'West', 'who', 'argue', 'documentary', 'was', ""n't"", 'sufficiently', 'pejorative', 'would', 'say', 'so', 'much', 'anti-Muslim', 'material', 'media', 'greater', 'need', 'media', 'give', 'bigger', 'picture', 'form', 'own', 'opinions', 'how', 'regard', 'Muslim', 'world', 'today']",N/A
