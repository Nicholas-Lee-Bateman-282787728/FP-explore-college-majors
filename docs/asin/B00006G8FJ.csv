714915,A19UTUEBWKIZFT,B00006G8FJ,AKN,"[8, 8]","Watching Sister Wendy, I don't know which is more moving; watching this small nun with the buck teeth and thick lisp as she so eloquently expounds on her views of the meanings behind great works of art, or the amazing works themselves.  It's really a toss up.Sister Wendy gets meanings out of each masterpiece that would fill a book on each painting.Things that, were we to go walking in a museum of great art would probably not even catch our attention, are brought to life and examined and explained in a way that is breathtaking.  Clearly, Sister Wendy has been gifted with the ability to actually see and understand what is in front of her, something that most of us don't do very well.This woman clearly is a genius.  It makes me wonder what else she observes and understands, about life and people.  How I would love to sit and talk to her, and soak up her wisdom.But at least, I can watch her as she takes us into great art museums around the world.She opens up art in an entirely new way for many of us.  There is so much there going on in these great masterpieces, so much the artists were telling us and showing us, if only we had the intuitive intelligence of Sister Wendy to see it and really comprehend it.Sister Wendy is a riot also. Her observations are pithy and blunt at times.  Wendy's laughing description of Caravaggio's cherubs as ""looking like 'rent boys'"" made me burst out laughing.  She is neither naive nor self censured.  She doesn't mince words.Sister Wendy graduated from Oxford University with honors with a degree in English Literature.  She then taught college in South Africa for a few years before returning to England.I read that Sister Wendy lives in a trailer in a far removed area of a convent, away from other people, as a hermit.  In this way she feels she can commune with God more easily.By keeping herself apart from the ordinary world and other people, she has opened up her intuitive mind and allowed her pineal gland, her third eye, to open and see probably better than her two other eyes.  I am thankful that she has brought her very unique and fascinating ability to the world so we can share a bit of what she thinks and feels and sees.  I find Sister Wendy and her insights to be very deeply moving.  They clearly come from a depth of feeling that almost none of us can comprehend.  What an utterly charming woman.  I hope to get a chance to see every DVD that is available.  It's rare to see such unique ability.",5,Gifted with insight,1346803200,"09 5, 2012",2012,2463,"['Watching', 'Sister', 'Wendy', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'more', 'moving', 'watching', 'small', 'nun', 'buck', 'teeth', 'thick', 'lisp', 'so', 'eloquently', 'views', 'meanings', 'great', 'works', 'art', 'amazing', 'really', 'toss', 'up.Sister', 'Wendy', 'meanings', 'masterpiece', 'would', 'fill', 'book', 'painting.Things', 'were', 'go', 'walking', 'museum', 'great', 'art', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'even', 'catch', 'attention', 'are', 'brought', 'life', 'examined', 'explained', 'way', 'breathtaking', 'Clearly', 'Sister', 'Wendy', 'been', 'gifted', 'ability', 'actually', 'see', 'understand', 'what', 'front', 'something', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'very', 'well.This', 'woman', 'clearly', 'genius', 'wonder', 'what', 'else', 'understands', 'life', 'people', 'How', 'would', 'love', 'sit', 'talk', 'soak', 'up', 'wisdom.But', 'least', 'can', 'watch', 'great', 'art', 'museums', 'world.She', 'up', 'art', 'entirely', 'new', 'way', 'many', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'great', 'masterpieces', 'so', 'much', 'artists', 'were', 'telling', 'showing', 'only', 'had', 'intuitive', 'intelligence', 'Sister', 'Wendy', 'see', 'really', 'comprehend', 'it.Sister', 'Wendy', 'riot', 'also', 'observations', 'are', 'pithy', 'blunt', 'times', 'Wendy', 'laughing', 'description', 'Caravaggio', 'cherubs', 'looking', ""'rent"", 'boys', 'made', 'burst', 'out', 'laughing', 'naive', 'self', 'censured', ""n't"", 'mince', 'words.Sister', 'Wendy', 'graduated', 'Oxford', 'University', 'honors', 'degree', 'English', 'Literature', 'then', 'taught', 'college', 'South', 'Africa', 'few', 'years', 'returning', 'England.I', 'read', 'Sister', 'Wendy', 'trailer', 'far', 'removed', 'area', 'convent', 'away', 'other', 'people', 'hermit', 'way', 'can', 'commune', 'God', 'more', 'easily.By', 'keeping', 'apart', 'ordinary', 'world', 'other', 'people', 'opened', 'up', 'intuitive', 'mind', 'allowed', 'pineal', 'gland', 'third', 'eye', 'open', 'see', 'probably', 'better', 'two', 'other', 'eyes', 'am', 'thankful', 'brought', 'very', 'unique', 'fascinating', 'ability', 'world', 'can', 'share', 'bit', 'what', 'feels', 'sees', 'find', 'Sister', 'Wendy', 'insights', 'be', 'very', 'deeply', 'moving', 'clearly', 'come', 'depth', 'feeling', 'almost', 'none', 'can', 'comprehend', 'What', 'utterly', 'charming', 'woman', 'hope', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'DVD', 'available', 'rare', 'see', 'such', 'unique', 'ability']",N/A

She begins with ancient cave paintings in France and works her way into the Renaissance (with Fra Angelico, Massaccio, Duccio and Leonardo.)  She explores 'history' paintings such as those done by Davide.  We see a fair share of religious art but we also see a surprising amount of the 'fleshy' works by Reubens, for example or Manet's 'Olimpia'.  I especially enjoy viewing the major impressionist pieces with her.  Sister Wendy helps viewers to learn how to look at works of art and she does not hesitate to express her personal reactions to the works.  Her aim in these four discs is to provide an overview of a wide range of artistic expression rather than to delve too deeply into any one work, period of history or 'school' of painting.  I ended up being appreciative of the many works she views with us rather than thinking I just came out of Art History class.

We must forget the densities of 'history' and simply surrender to the wonder of the story."""" --Sister Wendy BeckettThis four-DVD set presents every Sister Wendy episode from her Story of Painting series, plus Sister Wendy's Odyssey, Sister Wendy's Pains of Glass, Sister Wendy's Grand Tour and an interview with Sister Wendy.When watching these DVDs, you will become as enthralled with art as Sister Wendy is herself. As a long-time fan of her books, I was pleased to finally be able to view the art all over Europe and to hear her poetic explanations.When explaining the paintings at the Caves of Lascaux, I was surprised when she mentioned evolution. However, it was so delightful to hear a nun explaining the cave art and concluding that art is about being human. What made me laugh out loud was those times when she just breaks free from reticence and says things like ""male erotic fury"" when describing the cave painting.At times Sister Wendy says the most amusing things. They are all in innocence and show her beauty, yet slightly mischievous side.She is not your ""everyday"" nun or at least, she is not what I expected. She fully embraces art with an aesthetic sensibility all while exploring the very human and at times erotic side of art. Kids will never catch onto this as it will go right overtheir heads.I just find the way she becomes so intoxicated with art to be very entertaining. Sister Wendy seems to view the world with a sense of childlike wonder and yet has the knowledge of a scholar.The way she presents the art awakens a love and appreciation for art that becomes so strong you might even find yourself overwhelmed by beauty.Not only do you get to view the art, the environments in which it was created and see how art changed over time, Sister Wendy explains color, symbolism and the spiritual, political and personal aspects of the paintings. Art comes alive and is no longer just a painting. It is a combination of the experiences that make up life. She explains the emotions the characters are feeling and even gives logical explanations for the Mona Lisa's smile.I learned many things while viewing these DVDs. You can read many books on art, but viewing Sister Wendy's programs is a much more enlightening way to go. There is also a ""special feature"" where pop-up notes on artists and their work appear so you can view additional information while watching the shows. You can also pause the program to zoom in on the paintings.What makes these shows a thing of great beauty is the natural settings in which the art was created. You have waves crashing on rocks as she discusses Scotland in 800 AD. You view Venice in all its beauty and see Pompeii like never before.I had a difficult time writing anything down while watching the shows because I was so completely captivated.

In short, depite her rather unorthodox methods, Sister Wendy opens minds.",5,Great for beginners!,1134172800,"12 10, 2005",2005,671,"['use', 'Sister', 'Wendy', 'Art', 'History', 'classes', 'unsophisticated', 'students', 'who', 'tend', 'think', 'comic', 'books', 'video', 'games', 'are', 'fine', 'art', 'laugh', 'uproariously', 'Sister', 'Wendy', 'not', 'art', 'know', 'juvenile', 'truth', 'art', 'intimidate', 'people', 'react', 'deriding', 'defence', 'ignorance', 'Sister', 'Wendy', 'ice', 'sizzle', 'attract', 'viewer', 'works', 'might', 'normally', 'be', 'ignored', 'novice', 'access', 'timeless', 'beauty', 'melts', 'prejudice', 'humor', 'sincere', 'admiration', 'short', 'depite', 'rather', 'unorthodox', 'methods', 'Sister', 'Wendy', 'minds']",N/A

She is a passionate and persuasive advocate for her choices and it makes for engaging television to see a ""talent"" realising her thoughts into words in front of the camera, and not just reciting.

I fell in love with Sister Wendy's enthusiasm, and how she uses her vast knowledge of history, cultures and human nature to open up the world of art.  If you've gone to a gallery and looked at the art as 'pictures,' you haven't looked at it through Sister Wendy's eyes and heart.  She sees imagery and subtle sub-themes that the average person (like me) misses.
