When a long time sleeper cell wakes up they the cold war is pretty much over and they don't want to activate to spy or carry out covert operations against the U.S. any longer. The wife and husband have a teenage son who has only known the ways of being an American. The problem is they are being hunted by their own and only with the help of the FBI, and an agent played by Poitier, are they likely to have any chance at survival.

711752,A3TPSEI5YZO777,B00006CXGH,Jane Beckwith,"[1, 7]","Fortunately, I borrowed this DVD from my local library.  I like Sidney Poitier and saw River Phoenix in ""The Mosquito Coast"" years ago, so I thought the teaming of the two actors would be wonderful.  I like stories of espionage and intrigue as well.  This film, however, was a huge disappointment.  I wasn't for one moment convinced that Jeff's parents were Russian spies, that Sidney Poitier was an FBI agent or that the older Russian guy was a real threat. In addition, River Phoenix's character isn't very likable and it's so obvious that River Phoenix is acting.  The plot is choppy and there are very few suspenseful scenes or thrills (I don't consider a car chase scene a thrill).  Not recommended at all.",1,A real turkey,1244678400,"06 11, 2009",2009,711,"['Fortunately', 'borrowed', 'DVD', 'local', 'library', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'saw', 'River', 'Phoenix', 'Mosquito', 'Coast', 'years', 'ago', 'thought', 'teaming', 'two', 'actors', 'would', 'be', 'wonderful', 'stories', 'espionage', 'intrigue', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'however', 'was', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'moment', 'convinced', 'Jeff', 'parents', 'were', 'Russian', 'spies', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'was', 'FBI', 'agent', 'older', 'Russian', 'guy', 'was', 'real', 'threat', 'addition', 'River', 'Phoenix', 'character', ""n't"", 'very', 'likable', 'so', 'obvious', 'River', 'Phoenix', 'acting', 'plot', 'choppy', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'suspenseful', 'scenes', 'thrills', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'car', 'chase', 'scene', 'thrill', 'Not', 'recommended']",N/A

The premise, that Soviet sleepers of many years could be called up for espionage, is played out with Mr. Poitier as the FBI agent working to foil the Soviets.  I have only seen River Phoenix in this movie, yet he is masterful; it's such a shame his personal life was so tragic.  I hadn't seen this movie in more than 10 years when I purchased the DVD.  I found myself transfixed as I had in the movie theater originally.  The two actors playing the sleepers were terrific, though I can never remember their names.
