The animation is doen perfectly and makes me only wish they put as much hard work into the actual anime series that they did in the movie.  Oh well....its all still good.Anyways what this movie is about is an evil demon named Menomaru wants to unseal the power of his father, Hyoga, who was sealed away by Inuyasha's father.  To do so he needs the power of the Tetsusaiga to destroy the fang left behind to seal the demon.  Once Inu Yasha is tricked into doing this the real trouble soon begines as the souls of the many villagers on the island are slowly being drawn to Menomaru.  To make matters even worse, Kirara has been tunred against Sango and the others and now Sango must fight her one and only friend left from the demon slayer village.Thats the basic plot....now on to thhe specs...This movie has the following special features...~Line-art Gallery~Japanese Inuyahsa Movie Promos~Special Inuyasha Footage (all this is a background on the story)~Dolby 5.1 digital audioA few things that i noticed when watching the movie in english i noticed that some characters where speaking while anothers character's mouth is moving.  For example....when Kagoem is holding an arrow to Menomaru's two femal helpers you HEAR menomaru say ""you're a fiesty one"" but the blue haired girl is the one who's mouth is moving!  This is not the only time it happens...so i have to say that they didnt do the best of dubbing job.  Although if you like the japanese version you should be just fine.One of the best parts of the movie i think i just in the beggining as it moves back and forth between the characters and to a scene with flames with cast and so on listed...i thought is was cool.  One thing i noticed tho that this film starts out light hearted and funny like we all love and quicly gets serious within about 15 minutes.  You will then have the occasional funny scene between Miroku and Sango and one particular good one with Haachi...but i think it balances out okay...especiall at the end...make sure you watch thru all the credits to witness a very hilarious scene between Kagome and Inuyahsa!In a nut shell....buy This movie if you like Inuyahsa....it is a great asset to the series and you will surly be missing out if you dont.  It's great anime...no doubt about it.",5,Great Anime Movie!,1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,2331,"['Inuyahsa', 'Affections', 'Touching', 'time', 'great', 'movie', 'animation', 'doen', 'perfectly', 'only', 'put', 'as', 'much', 'hard', 'work', 'actual', 'anime', 'series', 'did', 'movie', 'Oh', 'well', 'still', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'evil', 'demon', 'named', 'Menomaru', 'unseal', 'power', 'father', 'Hyoga', 'who', 'was', 'sealed', 'away', 'Inuyasha', 'father', 'do', 'so', 'power', 'Tetsusaiga', 'destroy', 'fang', 'left', 'seal', 'demon', 'Once', 'Inu', 'Yasha', 'tricked', 'doing', 'real', 'trouble', 'soon', 'begines', 'souls', 'many', 'villagers', 'island', 'are', 'slowly', 'being', 'drawn', 'Menomaru', 'make', 'matters', 'even', 'worse', 'Kirara', 'been', 'tunred', 'Sango', 'others', 'now', 'Sango', 'must', 'fight', 'one', 'only', 'friend', 'left', 'demon', 'slayer', 'basic', 'plot', '.now', 'thhe', 'specs', 'movie', 'following', 'special', 'features', '~Line-art', 'Gallery~Japanese', 'Inuyahsa', 'Movie', 'Promos~Special', 'Inuyasha', 'Footage', 'background', 'story', '5.1', 'digital', 'audioA', 'few', 'things', 'i', 'noticed', 'when', 'watching', 'movie', 'english', 'i', 'noticed', 'characters', 'where', 'speaking', 'anothers', 'character', 'mouth', 'moving', 'example', '.when', 'Kagoem', 'holding', 'arrow', 'Menomaru', 'two', 'femal', 'helpers', 'HEAR', 'menomaru', 'say', ""'re"", 'fiesty', 'one', 'blue', 'haired', 'girl', 'one', 'who', 'mouth', 'moving', 'not', 'only', 'time', 'so', 'i', 'have', 'say', 'didnt', 'do', 'best', 'dubbing', 'job', 'like', 'japanese', 'version', 'should', 'be', 'just', 'fine.One', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'i', 'think', 'i', 'just', 'beggining', 'back', 'forth', 'characters', 'scene', 'flames', 'cast', 'so', 'listed', 'i', 'thought', 'was', 'cool', 'One', 'thing', 'i', 'noticed', 'tho', 'film', 'out', 'light', 'hearted', 'funny', 'love', 'quicly', 'serious', '15', 'minutes', 'will', 'then', 'have', 'occasional', 'funny', 'scene', 'Miroku', 'Sango', 'one', 'particular', 'good', 'one', 'Haachi', 'i', 'think', 'out', 'okay', 'especiall', 'end', 'make', 'sure', 'watch', 'thru', 'credits', 'witness', 'very', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'Kagome', 'Inuyahsa', 'nut', 'shell', '.buy', 'movie', 'like', 'Inuyahsa', '.it', 'great', 'asset', 'series', 'will', 'surly', 'be', 'missing', 'out', 'dont', 'great', 'anime', 'doubt']",N/A

The movie start's with a flashback when Kagome first came to the feudal era and it shows when Kagome broke the jewel shards into over 200 peices. The beaming light from the Jewel shards woke the insect demon Menomaru which is also the son of a very strong demon that Inuyasha's father killed 100 years ago. Now it is up to Inuyasha, Kagome, Miroku, Sango, and Shippo to stop him from ruling the world.

Apparently menomaru which is the son of a demon that was defeated by Inu-yasha's father was ressurected by the shikon crystals. Since then he's been trying to lure Inu-yasha to cut open his fathers power so that menomaru can inheirit his father's powers and strength. There were scenes that did kind of upset me because of what happened. Kagome ended up pulling a Kikyo move on Inu-yasha and shot him with an arrow. That scene just hurt me badly, but I also knew that it wasn't her fault because she didn't choose to do it.

833407,A3HBVVZCMJPPX4,B0002HODKE,Dr. Michael A. Rinella,"[7, 8]","[Contains minor spoiler information] There is always a problem of striking a balance in a feature made from a successful series.  You have to explain everything well enough for newcomers to figure out what's going on, but you can't do that excessively or you will lose the interest of the hard-core fans.The rather oddly named ""Affections Touching Across Time"" manages to strike a near-perfect balance, and as a result this is anime that really delivers.As noted by Amazon and other reviewers the plot of the movie would have also fit in as a well-done multi-part episode of the regular series.  The events in the movie appear to occur between the end of the second season and the beginning of the third, since Inu-Yasha has learned how to use the ""backlash wave"" with his sword.  Sesshomaru, however, does not carry his second sword for reasons unknown (maybe he hides it somewhere?).There is original soundtrack music, most of which is very good, but much of the background music is straight out of the series, or a cut from the series with some minor adaptation.  This isn't a problem since the music is truly excellent.The animation is where the movie really outdoes the series.  There is greater depth, richness of detail and color, and the occasional use of computer technology.  The characters look a bit different, but it's not so different that it ought to be criticized by hard-core fans.  It should be mentioned that the movie *has* been formatted for television viewing, it's not in letter box format (you can confirm this by watching the Japanese promotions, portions of which *are* in letterbox).All the major protagonists from the series (Inu-Yasha, Kagome, Miroku, Shippo, and Sango) are given moments to shine in the movie.  It might also be said that the worst aspects of each protagonist are ""toned down"" a little for the movie (as is the amount of blood spray during combats).  Some of the other major players appear, such as Sesshomaru and Kikyo.The major antagonist Menomaru and his helpers Ruri and Hari are - like the three antagonists in the Cowboy Bebop movie - a bit bland and, despite their great power, not particularly frightening, as some of the worst demons on the series are.  The choice of a moth demon was odd - a rather nasty one had already appeared on the series.  There is only the occasional hint of the kind of demonic morality/viewpoint of demons that you see quite often in the series, such as when the one side-kick demon says something like ""You're a handsome one, young Monk.  I think I'd like to dig out your heart, and eat it"".  There is a sub-plot involving Sango's animal companion, who is taken from her by Ruri and Hari and must be rescued, which I suspect younger viewers will enjoy.The combat between the demons Ruri and Hari, and the humans Miroku and Sango, is relatively more interesting than when Inu-Yasha and Kagome fight the main antagonist Menomaru.  The movie does a good job of showing the problems of humans fighting demons in combat (the demons don't tire, while the humans are soon gasping and perspiring), as well as the weakness of many demons (being in large part immortal, they are arrogant, careless, and overconfident).The young fox demon Shippo, who rarely is useful in combat on the series, displays more ability in the movie, even claiming to have killed three demons himself in the climatic battle.You also get to see minor protagonists such as Kagome's family, which is nice, since they all but disappeared after the first season of the series.  Her mom, brother, and grandfather all appear in the movie.There are a few eyebrow-raising moments and loose threads in the movie that don't add up.1.  Kikyo, Inu-Yasha's first love, appeared to be much taller in the movie than she is in the series.  In the series she has to stand on tip-toe to kiss Inu-Yasha - in the movie she often looked at least a foot taller, almost as tall as Sesshomaru (!?).2.  It's not clear where the jewel shard in the giant scorpion at the beginning of the movie came from, since Menomaru had only one, and it's inside his chest until much later.3.  Menomaru is brought back to life by a jewel shard immediately after the Shikon Jewel is shattered, but the events of the movie have to have been months or a year or more later.  The movie ignores this considerable period of time.  Where and how did Ruri and Hari appear from?4.  It didn't make sense for Kikyo to give a jewel shard to Kagome and then proceed to tell her she has to return to her own time and never return.  In the series Kikyo desires for the jewel to be restored so she can destroy it, and the demon Naraku.  Sending Kagome back to the present with the shard would make that impossible.  Unless, as Sesshomaru speculates, she is testing Kagome and knows she can use the sacred arrow to return to the feudal era.  Except if that's true -5. - how does Sesshomaru know about the confrontation between Kikyo and Kagome?  And it is hard to believe that Kikyo would show no reaction to his ""warning"" that only *he* would kill Inu-Yasha?  And how can Sesshomaru *still* think he can do that, given the power of Inu-Yasha's sword?The DVD includes some nice extras.  In addition to the Japanese promos, and the original ending-credits, you get a 30 minute long series of highlights from the first two seasons, that is very helpful in explaining much of the motivations of each character.  It doesn't have an English dub, unfortunately, only subtitles (and at times it has that shrill shout-in-your-face style of anime that doesn't translate well to western culture - the Simpsons did a great parody of it).The Japanese promotions for the movie contain a few clips that are not in the US release.  Either the footage was edited out before the movie was released in Japan (distinctly possible), or the US version is not identical to the Japanese version. Examples include Kagome swinging a *sword* at Inu-Yasha (this never happens in the movie when she is under Menomaru's control), and a scene where Kikyo and Sesshomaru are speaking to each other and you see the two of them *simultaneously* with Jaken and Rinn hiding behind some bushes (this too never happens in the movie).There is plenty of character art.  Some of these appear to be identical to those found on some of the regular DVDs, but much of it is original.",5,The Movie Delivers,1097625600,"10 13, 2004",2004,6332,"['[', 'Contains', 'minor',

833408,A2VF73N1AI95SQ,B0002HODKE,Dylan,"[10, 11]","I love the show Inuyasha.  The first Inuyasha movie is called Affections Touching Across Time.  The plot is fairly simple, yet exciting.  When Kagome's arrow broke the Sacred Jewel, a shard awakened Menomaru, the son of a powerful demon named Hyoga. Hyoga was defeated by Inuyasha's father and his great power was laid dormant thanks to one of Inuyasha's father's fangs. Menomaru and his followers attack our heros and ultimately break the seal around Hyoga's power.As Menomaru transforms into the new Hyoga, Kagome  and Kirara are being controlled by his followers.  Kagome turns on Inuyasha and Kirara on Sango.  As the new Hyoga awakens, Kagome becomes trapped in her world.  Can she get back to Inuyasha and help him defeat Hyoga?Elsewhere, Miroku has his Wind Tunnel copied by one of Hyoga's followers and the two battle.  Kirara helps another follower of Hyoga to fight Sango. Can Sango awaken Kirara and break Hyoga's hold?  Will Miroku's Wind Tunnel hold out against such a powerful foe?This movie is great.  The title is Affections Touching Across Time because Kagome and Inuyasha can still hear one another from different time dimensions all thanks to the Sacred Tree which began their story. I enjoyed this movie because it explains a bit about Inuyasha's father's past and the Trees of Ages.  However, what really steals the show are the bonds between Kagome and Inuyasha, Miroku and Sango, and Sango and Kirara that ultimately leave our heros victorious.Still, two major flaws of this movie are the lack of Sesshomaru and Naraku. Sesshomaru does have a few lines, and I love how he speaks to Kikyo, but not nearly enough.  Naraku is not even in the movie once!

In the film, Inuyasha, Kagome, and their friends must defeat Menomaru, the reawakened son of Hyoga (a powerful moth yokai that Inuyasha's father had defeated two hundred years earlier).The animation in the film is a little different than the anime series, because the character designs in the film more closely resemble the characters' manga counterparts.  There is also some use of computer animation in the movie.  Unfortunately, the CG that was used stands out like a sore thumb compared to the rest of the film.  However, the CG really needed to be used where it was (the shots of the Tree of Ages), because 2D animation would have been more limiting for what the filmmakers were trying to portray.There are some bonus features on the DVD.  While I was happy to see that the original Japanese trailers for the film were included, I was disappointed that English subtitles weren't included; without the English subtitles, the Japanese trailers were rather awkward for me to watch.  There are also some character line art sketches included in the extras.  There is also a 35-minute piece that appears to be a promotional piece that aired on Japanese television before the release of the film, which recaps what happened in the Inuyasha television series prior to the film.Overall, I thought the film was rather well-done.  Clock in at 100 minutes, it was just the right length to tell the story that the filmmakers wanted to tell.

The character renderings are different from the anime.  In this film they are not as well done, and certainly inconsistent.  In some frames they are perfect, in others a little off.  The backgrounds are excellent, though; I am sure many backgrounds were just borrowed from the series.In Affections, Inuyasha is cruder and meaner to Kagome and Shippo than he is in the series. It is not until just past the middle of the movie that the great stuff starts to happen.  Two powerful subplots, one involving Kirara's bond with Sango, the other Kagome's bond with Inu (hence the film's title), had me constantly removing my glasses because of the tears pouring out of my eyes.The main villian Menomaru and his two hench-wenches Ruri and Hari are foreign demons from ""the continent."" (China)  The story is nicely tied in with the Mongol invasion in 1281 that threatened all of Japan's culture and was stopped only by a sudden and tremendous typhoon.  In the movie, the Mongols were accompanied by demons, and were fought off by Inuyasha's powerful dog-demon father.  Menomaru is the vanquished demon Hyoga's son, and he is back for revenge.Unfortunately, Menomaru is a lame villian. He has moth feelers and uses moths to steal souls to make him stronger.  He looks just like the villian in Sailor Moon's Promise of the Rose.  His formidable female helpers are the real baddies.  Oh, they are bad.  And they look gorgeous.Now, about Kagome's Dad.  He is never shown or mentioned in the anime.  But in the closing credits, you can clearly see a very young (sixteen or so) Kagome's mom dressed as a maiko, or apprentice geisha.  The father of the children could be a wealthy patron.  That is how she supports the family and her father.  It is not only Kagome's ojiisan who is keeping the traditions of Japan alive.Speaking of extras, the extras in Affections are amazing.  The Japanese closing credits show the pictures (of what happened after the movie ended) larger than the English ones.  There is a long feature called All About Inuyasha.  It goes through the entire series from start to finish and is narrated by several characters, including Myoga, Hachi, Kaede, and Rin.Also, Sesshoumaru and Kikyo meet for the first time in this film. Although their exchange is brief, I am not giving anything away by including this short, great line, one of the best in the film:Jaken: Lord Sesshoumaru, is it wise to let that woman live?Sesshoumaru: You fool, she is dead.Jaken: HUUUUUHHHHH?????",4,Very Good ; Mystery of Kagome's Father Solved?,1098144000,"10 19, 2004",2004,2581,"['Inuyasha', 'Affections', 'Touching', 'Time', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Not', 'knock-your-socks-off', 'WOW', 'GREAT', 'character', 'renderings', 'are', 'different', 'anime', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'done', 'certainly', 'inconsistent', 'frames', 'are', 'perfect', 'others', 'little', 'off', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'excellent', 'am', 'sure', 'many', 'backgrounds', 'were', 'just', 'borrowed', 'series.In', 'Affections', 'Inuyasha', 'cruder', 'meaner', 'Kagome', 'Shippo', 'series', 'not', 'just', 'middle', 'movie', 'great', 'stuff', 'happen', 'Two', 'powerful', 'subplots', 'one', 'involving', 'Kirara', 'bond', 'Sango', 'other', 'Kagome', 'bond', 'Inu', 'hence', 'film', 'title', 'had', 'constantly', 'removing', 'glasses', 'tears', 'pouring', 'eyes.The', 'main', 'villian', 'Menomaru', 'two', 'hench-wenches', 'Ruri', 'Hari', 'are', 'foreign', 'demons', 'continent', 'China', 'story', 'nicely', 'tied', 'Mongol', 'invasion', '1281', 'threatened', 'Japan', 'culture', 'was', 'stopped', 'only', 'sudden', 'tremendous', 'typhoon', 'movie', 'Mongols', 'were', 'accompanied', 'demons', 'were', 'fought', 'off', 'Inuyasha', 'powerful', 'dog-demon', 'father', 'Menomaru', 'vanquished', 'demon', 'Hyoga', 'son', 'back', 'revenge.Unfortunately', 'Menomaru', 'lame', 'villian', 'moth', 'feelers', 'moths', 'steal', 'souls', 'make', 'stronger', 'just', 'villian', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'Promise', 'Rose', 'formidable', 'female', 'helpers', 'are', 'real', 'baddies', 'Oh', 'are', 'bad', 'look', 'gorgeous.Now', 'Kagome', 'Dad', 'never', 'shown', 'mentioned', 'anime', 'closing', 'credits', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'very', 'young', 'sixteen', 'so', 'Kagome', 'mom', 'dressed', 'maiko', 'apprentice', 'geisha', 'father', 'children', 'could', 'be', 'wealthy', 'patron', 'how', 'family', 'father', 'not', 'only', 'Kagome', 'ojiisan', 'who', 'keeping', 'traditions', 'Japan', 'alive.Speaking', 'extras', 'extras', 'Affections', 'are', 'amazing', 'Japanese', 'closing', 'credits', 'show', 'pictures', 'what', 'happened', 'movie', 'ended', 'larger', 'English', 'ones', 'long', 'feature', 'called', 'Inuyasha', 'entire', 'series', 'start', 'finish', 'narrated', 'several', 'characters', 'including', 'Myoga', 'Hachi', 'Kaede', 'Rin.Also', 'Sesshoumaru', 'Kikyo', 'meet', 'first', 'time', 'film', 'exchange', 'brief', 'am', 'not', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'including', 'short', 'great', 'line', 'one', 'best', 'film', 'Jaken', 'Lord', 'Sesshoumaru', 'wise', 'let', 'woman', 'live', 'Sesshoumaru', 'fool', 'dead.Jaken', 'HUUUUUHHHHH']",N/A

She retrieves the tip, makes a new Arrow and uses it to clear the Well and return to Inuyasha's side.

They talked all the time and made comments until some woman yelled at them.Enough of that, the movie's plot is like this. I'm not exactly sure when in the series this takes place. Inu Yasha knows the Bakuryuuha (or Backlash Wave as they dubbed it) but for some reason, Sesshomaru (only seen twice through out the movie) doesn't have Tokijin.Anyway, Inu Yasha and the gang are running around trying to find jewel shards when they run into a giant scorpion with one in it. During the battle Kirara is injured and becomes possessed. Sango and Miroku are trapped by two minions of our head villian Menomaru while Inu Yasha, trying to find Kagome after an arguement, runs into Menomaru himself. It seems Menomaru wishes for Inu Yasha to use his Kizu no Kaze (or Wind Scar for those people who like it) to destroy a fang of Inu Yasha's father that locks Menomaru's father, the Hyoga, with all his power restrained. Inu Yasha, of course, thinks he's doing the right thing when he sends a couple streaming lines of energy at Menomaru, directly in front of the fang, but soon learns (and hates) that he's just being used.Menomaru begins to suck souls from everyone around the world while possessing Kagome to shoot Inu Yasha with an arrow (gasp, just like Kikyo). Kagome is forced to return to her own world (the well is sealing up for reasons explained in the movie) and feels deep heartbreak becuase she'll never see Inu Yasha again (this was just where all the cosplays in the theater went ""awwwww"").I'm giving away too much of the story but that's a good enough explination.",5,"Great Movie, Terrible Audiences (note: some spoilers inside)",1093046400,"08 21, 2004",2004,1759,"['THOUGHT', 'had', 'great', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'Inu', 'Yasha', 'first', 'movie', 'big', 'screen', 'free', 'curtesy', 'VIZ', 'when', 'began', 'watch', 'realized', 'what', 'jerks', 'were', 'world', 'talked', 'time', 'made', 'comments', 'woman', 'yelled', 'them.Enough', 'movie', 'plot', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'when', 'series', 'place', 'Inu', 'Yasha', 'Bakuryuuha', 'Backlash', 'Wave', 'dubbed', 'reason', 'Sesshomaru', 'only', 'seen', 'twice', 'out', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'Tokijin.Anyway', 'Inu', 'Yasha', 'gang', 'are', 'running', 'around', 'trying', 'find', 'jewel', 'shards', 'when', 'run', 'giant', 'scorpion', 'one', 'battle', 'Kirara', 'injured', 'becomes', 'possessed', 'Sango', 'Miroku', 'are', 'trapped', 'two', 'minions', 'head', 'villian', 'Menomaru', 'Inu', 'Yasha', 'trying', 'find', 'Kagome', 'arguement', 'Menomaru', 'Menomaru', 'wishes', 'Inu', 'Yasha', 'use', 'Kizu', 'Kaze', 'Wind', 'Scar', 'people', 'who', 'destroy', 'fang', 'Inu', 'Yasha', 'father', 'Menomaru', 'father', 'Hyoga', 'power', 'restrained', 'Inu', 'Yasha', 'course', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'when', 'couple', 'streaming', 'lines', 'energy', 'Menomaru', 'directly', 'front', 'fang', 'soon', 'learns', 'just', 'being', 'used.Menomaru', 'begins', 'suck', 'souls', 'everyone', 'world', 'possessing', 'Kagome', 'shoot', 'Inu', 'Yasha', 'arrow', 'gasp', 'just', 'Kikyo', 'Kagome', 'forced', 'return', 'own', 'world', 'well', 'sealing', 'up', 'reasons', 'explained', 'movie', 'feels', 'deep', 'heartbreak', 'becuase', ""'ll"", 'never', 'see', 'Inu', 'Yasha', 'again', 'was', 'just', 'where', 'cosplays', 'theater', 'went', 'awwwww', '.I', ""'m"", 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'good', 'enough', 'explination']",N/A
