252736,AZSN1TO0JI87B,6301435192,A. Estes,"[2, 2]","William Ragsdale and Roddy McDowall return for more vampire slaying craziness in ""Fright Night: Part 2."" Taking place three years after the events of thefirst film, the sequel finds Charley Brewster a little older and a little wiser. Thanks to some therapy, Charley no longer believes in vampires and is trying his hardest to move on with his life, which includes his college studies, a new love interest (Traci Lind) clinging to his side and a gnarly mullet to boot. Unfortunately, just as things start getting back on track for our hero, a gang of vampires comes to town seeking food, a good time, and some good old fashioned vengeance. It's up to Charley and the down-on-his-luck Peter Vincent to once again put a stop to the madness.Directed by Tommy Lee Wallace (""Halloween III - Season Of The Witch""), ""Fright Night: Part 2"" is somewhat lacking in the charming spirit of the original. While Wallace (a John Carpenter prot&eacute;g&eacute;) puts on a good show with the aid of a fog machine and an excellent score by the great Brad Fiedel in tow, the film can't help but succumb to sequelitis. While the character of Charley may have moved on, his routine certainly hasn't. Even though the film makes an effort to not repeat the events of the first film, it can't help but slip into redundancy with a ""been there, done that"" vibe running throughout. It also doesn't help that this new gaggle of baddies lack the charisma of Chris Sarandon and come across as less of a threat than they do a cast of rejects from Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" video.It's not all bad for this sequel, though. On the plus side, Wallace keeps the pace quick and easy. Reuniting with characters from the original film is a treat and it's nice to see their characters expanded upon as well. Both Ragsdale and McDowall are on their game and it shows in the final product as the two whole-heartedly carry the film. Traci Lind makes for a slightly less interesting love interest than Amanda Bearse in the original, but has a likable energy about her that makes one wonder why her career never took off. All in all, ""Fright Night: Part 2"" is an enjoyable if flawed re-entry into familiar territory. It might not have the same ""bite"" as the original, but it's certainly not one of the worst sequels of its era either.Side note: Beware of the Artisan DVD. It is a bare-bones release which is nothing more than a transfer from a VHS source. It's not in its original widescreen presentation and looks and sounds like garbage. Hopefully someday in the future another company will get it right and release it in all of its glory on Blu-Ray/DVD, but for now, this is unfortunately as good as it gets.",3,Less bite but still alright.,1294790400,"01 12, 2011",2011,2669,"['William', 'Ragsdale', 'Roddy', 'McDowall', 'return', 'more', 'vampire', 'slaying', 'craziness', 'Fright', 'Night', 'Part', '2', 'Taking', 'place', 'three', 'years', 'events', 'thefirst', 'film', 'sequel', 'Charley', 'Brewster', 'little', 'older', 'little', 'wiser', 'Thanks', 'therapy', 'Charley', 'no', 'longer', 'vampires', 'trying', 'hardest', 'move', 'life', 'college', 'studies', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'Traci', 'Lind', 'clinging', 'side', 'gnarly', 'mullet', 'boot', 'Unfortunately', 'just', 'things', 'start', 'getting', 'back', 'track', 'hero', 'gang', 'vampires', 'town', 'seeking', 'food', 'good', 'time', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'vengeance', 'up', 'Charley', 'down-on-his-luck', 'Peter', 'Vincent', 'once', 'again', 'put', 'stop', 'madness.Directed', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Wallace', 'Halloween', 'III', 'Season', 'Witch', 'Fright', 'Night', 'Part', '2', 'somewhat', 'lacking', 'charming', 'spirit', 'original', 'Wallace', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'good', 'show', 'aid', 'fog', 'machine', 'excellent', 'score', 'great', 'Brad', 'Fiedel', 'tow', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'succumb', 'sequelitis', 'character', 'Charley', 'may', 'have', 'moved', 'routine', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'Even', 'film', 'effort', 'not', 'repeat', 'events', 'first', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'slip', 'redundancy', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'vibe', 'running', 'also', ""n't"", 'help', 'new', 'gaggle', 'baddies', 'lack', 'charisma', 'Chris', 'Sarandon', 'come', 'less', 'threat', 'do', 'cast', 'rejects', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Thriller', 'video.It', 'not', 'bad', 'sequel', 'though', 'plus', 'side', 'Wallace', 'pace', 'quick', 'easy', 'Reuniting', 'characters', 'original', 'film', 'treat', 'nice', 'see', 'characters', 'expanded', 'as', 'well', 'Ragsdale', 'McDowall', 'are', 'game', 'final', 'product', 'two', 'whole-heartedly', 'carry', 'film', 'Traci', 'Lind', 'slightly', 'less', 'interesting', 'love', 'interest', 'Amanda', 'Bearse', 'original', 'likable', 'energy', 'one', 'wonder', 'why', 'career', 'never', 'took', 'off', 'Fright', 'Night', 'Part', '2', 'enjoyable', 'flawed', 're-entry', 'familiar', 'territory', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'bite', 'original', 'certainly', 'not', 'one', 'worst', 'sequels', 'era', 'either.Side', 'note', 'Beware', 'Artisan', 'DVD', 'bare-bones', 'release', 'nothing', 'more', 'transfer', 'VHS', 'source', 'not', 'original', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'like', 'garbage', 'Hopefully', 'someday', 'future', 'company', 'will', 'get', 'right', 'release', 'glory', 'Blu-Ray/DVD', 'now', 'unfortunately', 'as', 'good']",Fright Night Part 2 VHS

Now, the beautiful vampiress Regine and her fiendish entourage have arrived seeking revenge against those responsible for her brother's death! William Ragsdale and Roddy McDowall return for another spooky adventure care of the talented Tommy Lee Wallace, who steps in to direct for series creator Tom Holland. Wallace gives us many more ambitious and atmospheric moments, including a werewolf's vertical ascent up the dormitory wall, several swooping crane shots from the wings of the bat, Regine's swirling appearance out of the mist in Charley's dorm room, and the grand entrance into Regine's lair that is suddenly lit by hundreds of candles. These touches keep with the Gothic traditions of the original FRIGHT NIGHT, but are updated with more modern make-up and special effects. This is where the lower budget is most evident, however, since the costumes fall slightly behind the incredible work that was shown before. Julie Carmen is dark and mysterious as the temptress Regine, although she does not have quite the presence as her toothy counterpart, Chris Sarandon. Unfortunately, Roddy McDowall is given few moments to shine this second time around, as his character simply goes through the same motions as he had in the first film. Jon Gries, Brian Thompson, and Russell Clark, on the other hand, provide memorable bits playing Regine's evil cohorts.

As sequels go, this one isn't too bad.  It did manage to retain some of the the charm of the original, but the surprises are a little worn.  The introduction of new creatures is welcome, along with a new vampire, but they seemed a little too Euro-trashy and not as menacing to me.  The story is fairly the same, with some minor changes, which was a little disappointing as I was hoping for a little more originality, being the optimist that I am....As far as the presentation of the movie on this DVD, it is very poor.  I am unsure if there was a widescreen version of this movie, but I did notice some cropping, panning and scanning which may suggest that this was originally released in a different format.  The picture is at times fuzzy, grainy, and generally pretty poor all around.  The sound is a little better.  There are no extras, not even a token trailer.

That said, I have been waiting for a few years (ever since the release of the first FN film by Columbia TriStar in '99) for Part II to become available on DVD.I'm not disappointed that the presentation is full-frame, 1.33:1, as from what I understand, the film was originally shot in this aspect ratio.  I'm not even disappointed that there aren't any extras to speak of (extras being rare for any sequel DVD, really).No, the problem lies with the ABOMINABLE transfer.  The movie seems to have been mastered directly from whatever print Vista had lying around--it's very grainy and looks about the same, or perhaps slightly worse than, an SP speed VHS copy.  For DVD, it's absolutely hideous.  Artisan should know better than to release such product without at least attempting a remastering which would have tightened up the picture and made it worth the DVD release (look at the 2 films' DVD releases side-by-side...nothing to compare!).If you're a Fright Night completist or just really really like the movie, buy this DVD.

They both rank up there with Salem's Lot, Bram Stoker's Dracula, The Lost Boys, and many others. The only problem with Fright Night 2 is the DVD release by Artisan. The first Fright Night was released by Columbia TriStar and was a flipper disc. Although there were little to no extras on that disc the movie still had a great anamorphic widescreen transfer that still holds up. Fright Night 2 should also have gotten that but NO it didn't. Artisan treated this worthy sequel with no respect whatsoever. Despite the crimes that Artisan committed, I hope that Lionsgate rereleases the movie with a anamorphic widescreen transfer in its original aspect ratio with some good extras too. The first Fright Night should get rereleased too in a better edition. The 25th Anniversary of Fright Night is coming in two years so be prepared for it hopefully.

I actually went to see this film during its limited theatrical release nearly 20 years ago and I had a blast.Monsters HD (part of the Voom HD channel suite that USED to be carried on Dish Network but sadly Dish dropped Voom 5/2008) just got Fright Night II transferred over to HD from the original negative and that usually means that a spiffy DVD release may not be to far around the bend.Seriously, this is fun flick with some cool make up effects and comedic gags; enough for any vampire movie lover to sink their fangs into. If you like 80s horror films than this is a MUST see.I am just hoping for a nice wide screen transfer of the film with a 5.1 DD sound track. Is that too much to ask for? Some extras like commentary and or cast interviews would be swell too.The Artisan DVD release from a few years ago was a joke. I remember running out to get this and was floored at the awful picture quality; honestly it is no better than a standard VHS picture.

252762,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,6301435192,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[4, 6]","The orignial ""Fright Night"" is a very entertaining movie, but it wasn't scary and neither is ""Fright Night 2"", but one has to admit that both movies have style, vampire style.  ""Fright Night 2"" does what many sequels don't do and that is that it actually follows up where the original left off, at least relatively speaking.  Bringing back Roddy McDowell and William Ragsdale (notwithstanding his mullet) as Peter Vincent and Charlie Brewster was a great idea as the sequel maintains some of the flavor and attitude of the original ""Fright Night""The plot of ""Fright Night 2"" is quite simple.  Charlie Brewster is now in college and is trying to move on with his life...he is seeing a psychiatrist who has convinced him that vampires do not exist and that group hypnosis was to blame for his and Peter Vincent's hallucinations of vampires.  Charlie has a new girlfriend, but deep down inside, Charlie still feels something is not right and that's where Regine Dandridge comes in as she is a vampire, the sister of Jerry Dandridge who was vanquished by Charlie and Peter in the first movie.  Naturally, Regine wants revenge for her brother's destruction.  Charlie experiences terrible nightmares and begins to suffer mightily.  It is up to Peter Vincent and Alex (Charlie's new girlfriend) to stop Regine from making Charlie one of her own.Tommy Lee Wallace, who also directed ""Halloween III"", does some interesting things with the vampires in ""Fright Night 2"".  At times, the vampires look like ridiculous looking monsters and the movie was vague at best and sometimes ambivalent about whether the man with sideburns was a vampire or a werewolf...he ended up coming off looking like a dork if you ask me.  At any rate, it is clearly evident that the vampire makeup that was so well done in the original ""Fright Night"" is a bit lacking in the sequel.  It appears that Wallace and others thought to spice things up with the vampires' appearance and so on and so forth, but the prowess and effectiveness of the vampires are diminished from what was produced so very well in the original ""Fright Night"".The plot of ""Fright Night 2"" is what makes the movie work and the movie is entertaining, but there is no doubt that the wild and flamboyant attempts to spice things up in this sequel hurt the movie in my opinion.  Also, some attempts at border line lame comedy were also in poor taste.  Essentially, ""Fright Night 2"" is not as strong of a movie as the original ""Fright Night"" and while neither movie is scary or pure horror, the original ""Fright Night"" provides an excellent treatment and aesthetically convincing product that the sequel lacks.Despite various inconsistencies and some confusion with traditional vampire lore e.g. vampires walking about in daylight hours, ""Fright Night 2"" is a solid movie that is quite entertaining, but perhaps if the movie contained its perameters within the more conventional and classic vampire traditions, the movie could have been somewhat more effective.  That said, ""Fright Night 2"" does not have the requisite atmosphere to be characterized as a traditional horror movie, nor the makeup or potential to be as darkly powerful and as horrifying as ""Dracula"" or ""Salem's Lot"", but the unique style of the ""Fright Night"" series make both movies worth owning if you are a vampire movie fan like myself.  However, as far as pure and unadulterated horror, you won't find it here...hence, the 2.35 STAR rating.",2,2.35 STARS: A pretty decent sequel as far as sequels go.,1128384000,"10 4, 2005",2005,3443,"['orignial', 'Fright', 'Night', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'scary', 'Fright', 'Night', '2', 'one', 'admit', 'movies', 'have', 'style', 'vampire', 'style', 'Fright', 'Night', '2', 'what', 'many', 'sequels', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'actually', 'up', 'where', 'original', 'left', 'off', 'least', 'relatively', 'speaking', 'Bringing', 'back', 'Roddy', 'McDowell', 'William', 'Ragsdale', 'notwithstanding', 'mullet', 'Peter', 'Vincent', 'Charlie', 'Brewster', 'was', 'great', 'idea', 'sequel', 'flavor', 'attitude', 'original', 'Fright', 'Night', 'plot', 'Fright', 'Night', '2', 'quite', 'simple', 'Charlie', 'Brewster', 'now', 'college', 'trying', 'move', 'life', 'seeing', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'convinced', 'vampires', 'do', 'not', 'exist', 'group', 'hypnosis', 'was', 'blame', 'Peter', 'Vincent', 'hallucinations', 'vampires', 'Charlie', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'deep', 'inside', 'Charlie', 'still', 'something', 'not', 'right', 'where', 'Regine', 'Dandridge', 'vampire', 'sister', 'Jerry', 'Dandridge', 'who', 'was', 'vanquished', 'Charlie', 'Peter', 'first', 'movie', 'Naturally', 'Regine', 'revenge', 'brother', 'destruction', 'Charlie', 'terrible', 'nightmares', 'suffer', 'mightily', 'Peter', 'Vincent', 'Alex', 'Charlie', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'stop', 'Regine', 'making', 'Charlie', 'one', 'own.Tommy', 'Lee', 'Wallace', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'Halloween', 'III', 'interesting', 'things', 'vampires', 'Fright', 'Night', '2', 'times', 'vampires', 'look', 'ridiculous', 'looking', 'monsters', 'movie', 'was', 'vague', 'best', 'sometimes', 'ambivalent', 'man', 'sideburns', 'was', 'vampire', 'werewolf', 'ended', 'up', 'coming', 'off', 'looking', 'dork', 'ask', 'rate', 'clearly', 'evident', 'vampire', 'makeup', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'original', 'Fright', 'Night', 'bit', 'lacking', 'sequel', 'Wallace', 'others', 'thought', 'spice', 'things', 'up', 'vampires', 'appearance', 'so', 'so', 'forth', 'prowess', 'effectiveness', 'vampires', 'are', 'diminished', 'what', 'was', 'produced', 'so', 'very', 'well', 'original', 'Fright', 'Night', '.The', 'plot', 'Fright', 'Night', '2', 'what', 'movie', 'work', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'doubt', 'wild', 'flamboyant', 'attempts', 'spice', 'things', 'up', 'sequel', 'hurt', 'movie', 'opinion', 'Also', 'attempts', 'border', 'line', 'lame', 'comedy', 'were', 'also', 'poor', 'taste', 'Essentially', 'Fright', 'Night', '2', 'not', 'strong', 'movie', 'original', 'Fright', 'Night', 'movie', 'scary', 'pure', 'horror', 'original', 'Fright', 'Night', 'excellent', 'treatment', 'aesthetically', 'convincing', 'product', 'sequel', 'lacks.Despite', 'various', 'inconsistencies', 'confusion', 'traditional', 'vampire', 'lore', 'e.g', 'vampires', 'walking', 'daylight', 'hours', 'Fright', 'Night', '2', 'solid', 'movie', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'perhaps', 'movie', 'contained', 'perameters', 'more', 'conventional', 'classic', 'vampire', 'traditions', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'somewhat', 'more', 'effective', 'said', 'Fright', 'Night', '2', 'not', 'have', 'requisite', 'atmosphere', 'be', 'characterized', 'traditional', 'horror', 'movie', 'makeup', 'potential', 'be', 'darkly', 'powerful', 'as', 'horrifying', 'Dracula', 'Salem', 'Lot', 'unique', 'style', 'Fright', 'Night', 'series', 'make', 'movies', 'owning', 'are', 'vampire', 'movie', 'fan', 'However', 'as', 'far', 'pure', 'unadulterated', 'horror', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here', 'hence', '2.35', 'STAR', 'rating']",Fright Night Part 2 VHS

252764,AQ01Q3070LT29,6301435192,James McDonald,"[1, 2]","William Ragsdale as ""Charlie"" and Roddy McDowall as ""Mr. Vincent"" are back in this sequel toFright Night(1985).  Charlie has been through three years of therapy.  He no longer believes there is such a thing as vampires.  He is now in college and has thrown out all that garlic and wooden spikes.  Charlie has a new girlfriend.  This time the male vampire's sister is in town with her brood and they are out for the kill, and after Charlie too. You will notice this film was made by a different company, the film is lower budget, the film is grainy, not many classical artsy close-ups and the story is bland.  But William Ragsdale and Roddy McDowall manage to keep it afloat. If you are a die-hard fan of Fright Night (1985), then I would recommend Fright Night Part II.  But you'll feel something is missing, and that my friend is the sensational Amanda Bearse and the energetic Stephen Geoffreys.

252769,A6VFFRIHAXKRL,6301435192,"J. Paul ""John doe""","[0, 0]","Now it's time for the underrated Fright Night II which is more of an straight forward sequel. I can't find the budget info on this movie but the movie made $2 million. Directed by Tommy Lee Wallace he directed Halloween III which I do like as a stand alone movie as well he directed It. It stars William Ragsdadle as Charley Brewster, Roddy McDwall as Peter Vincent, Traci Lind as Alex Young, Brian Thompson as Bozworth, Julie Carmen as Regine Dandridge &  Ernie Sabella as Dr Harrison. Story is about 3 or 4 years after the 1st movie Charley Brewster is seeing a Psychitrist Dr Harrison & he has some kind of therepy & he believes Vampire's aren't real & that Jerry Dandridge was just a killer posing as a Vampire. He is in College now & has a new Alex who goes to the same college. I didn't like that they never explained what happend to Amy. But they go to see Peter Vincent he sees a group of people taking coffins into the building. Later on that night The Vampires are going around the campus 1 of them manages to kill this girl. Charley has a nightmare where Regine bites him. Later on Charley goes to see Alex cause they are going to this Oprea he spots Regine follows them to this apartment building he sees a friend of his being bitten. He goes to get Peter Vincent. They go to find out what's going on there is this party going on. Regine puts Charley under a trance they have some kind of weirds  3  x  y dance. He finds his friend there is no bite marks. Regine tells Charley & Peter that she is a perfomance artist. Charley forgot he was suppose to meet Alex. At the oprea you have this Vampire Louie who is stalking Alex. Meanwhile Peter thinks that these people are really Vampires he checks his mirror & the mirror relects less people than are in the room. Peter gets out of there he is confronted by Regine she tells him that she is the sister of Jerry Dandridge & that she is going to exact revenge on him & Charley Brewster. So that night while Charley is aspleep Regine goes in to his room & bites him. So the next day Charlye acts strange like when he's eating pizza the garlic makes him weak. He tries to find Regine's coffin in the basement of the apartment building & drive a stake through her chest. You also have The limo Driver Bozworth roaming around & he eats bugs. Charley finds Regine's coffin she  puts him in a trance & stops him. Regine also takes over Peter Vincent's Fright Night show.  You also have The Limo Driver Bozworth & the other Vampires go bowling. I'll admit I found it pretty funny.  Later on Charley goes & studies with Alex she goes to get Charley some water & he reveals to her what he really is & he chases Charley & Alex through the library. Louie has ahold of Charley Alex crams roses down Louei's throat it burns his mouth & throat he jumps out a window Charley & Alex are taken by campus police. Peter Vincent has also been taken to jail cause he tries to kill Regine on the set of Fright Night. He is sent to a hostpital cause he is going on about Vampires. Alex is bailed out by Dr Harrison & she finds out that Charley was bailed out by Regine. So they go off to get Peter where Dr Harrison reveals himself as a vampire & I was like ok when was he bit. Anyway Alex kills him takes his papers so she can get Peter out of the nut house. They go & get some items to kill Vampires with. They climb up the building & get in through a window where they are confronted by that friend of Charley's who is really a vampire. Peter throws Holy Water in his face you have a cool effect where where that vampire's throat opens up & water shoots out. They try & escape where Charley who is turnng into a a vampire & starts attacking Peter. Alex takes some kind of sheet & it harms him & he stops. Peter is headed out of the window where Louie in Ware Wolf form is going to kill him. Charley takes this cross bow fires a stake into his chest. Bozworth confronts them Charley fires the cross bow at him but he cathces the stake. 1 of The Vampire's takes Alex Regine comes in. Regine tries to make Charley bite Alex. Alex keeps telling Charley that she loves him I buy it even more than Charley & Amy's realationship in the 1st movie maybe cause it's more of a mature adult realationship. Charley fights off Regine's control takes this Vampire's hands claws in Bozworth's stomach & a bunch of bugs fall out pretty good gore. They put that sheet over that Vampire & it melts in a good practical effect. Peter opens the blinds letting in sunlight Regine turns into a bat she goes to the basement. Chaley & Alex go to the basement & put cummion wafers in the coffins. I have to say the make up for Regine when she is in Vampire form I like better than make up used for Chris Sarandon. Regine knocks out Alex Peter takes a shard of glass & reflects sunlight down a hole into the basement Charley pulls her twords the sunlight where she catch's fire & dies. Then it goes to a little while later where Charley & Alex talk about what happpend & the future & that's pretty much the film. I'm sorry if I didn't explain everything well in my retrospective. All in all Fright Night II is a good sequel. The cast is fine & it's a lot better than the remake. Great score by Brad Fidel. Tommy Lee Wallace did a pretty good job directing. William Ragsdale was good but not as good as he was in the 1st movie. Roddy McDowall was good. Julie Carmen was decent not as good as Chris Sarandon was as the villain in the 1st movie. But she was better than Colin Farrell. Erinie Sabelle I didn't care either way. I had to see this on YT I have been looking for a copy for over a year The DVD is expensive plus it's in fullscreen which isn't good on bigger TV's & I have heard The DVD is a copy from a VHS The DVD has no features apparently there was a Blu Ray put out but it's out of stock. I would like to see Shout Factory get the rights to Fright Night 1 & II & give them good releases.

Its semi-creepy, and along with fright night is one of the few vampire flicks I have seen that I enjoyed quite a bit.The story is Charlie Brewster (William Ragsdale) who is still recovering from his last vampire encounter(as seen in the first Fright Night) is a seeing a Psychiatrist and keeps encountering a very seductive and exotic female, but he thinks they are dreams and he see starts seeing his shrink about it. After visiting the washed up vampire slayer Peter Vincent(Roddy McDowel, whom helped him in the first film)he tries convince himself once again vampires do not exist.Other than the pointless topless scene (though some people feel nudity is a necessity in horror films, I don't), this movie is fairly entertaining, it is not nearly as creepy as the first film.  Chris Sarandon as the vampire Jerry Dandridge made a much sexier and scarier vampire than does the woman in this film.

252774,A2M1N8G4W4END8,6301435192,Michael R Gates,"[4, 6]","Counseling has convinced Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale)--the hero from the smash flick FRIGHT NIGHT (1985)--that vampires don't exist and that he and his friend, TV horror host Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), didn't actually kill one.  But Charley has a ""relapse"" when he notices that a new tenant in Peter's apartment building is moving in with a lot of coffins and other trappings of the bloodsucking lifestyle.Not nearly as clever nor as slick as its predecessor, FRIGHT NIGHT PART II is still an entertaining vampire flick that will please fans of the vampire sub-genre and should delight fans of the original.  Most of the elements that made the first flick a success are still there--the rapport between Charley and Peter Vincent; a damsel in distress; an alluring and powerful vampire (this time played by Julie Carmen); tongue-in-cheek and off-beat humor; and cool special FX.  Noticeably missing is Charley's best-friend-turned-vamp Evil Ed Thompson (Stephen Geoffreys), who was the delightfully over-the-top comic relief in the first flick.  While actor Jon Gries does a pretty good job as the scary but comical character in FRIGHT NIGHT PART II, he just can't fully fill the shoes of the quirky Geoffreys.  Still, FRIGHT NIGHT PART II does offer some chills and surprises, and as horror sequels go, it is top-notch and delivers the goods that fans desire.That's the good news.  Now for the bad.The DVD from Artisan (Lionsgate/Fox) is a bit disappointing, mainly due to two factors.  First off, the film is offered in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio.  While some sources indicate that this is the format in which the film was originally shot, other sources indicate that the original aspect ratio was 2.35:1.  Even if the film was shot in what is traditionally called the ""full-screen"" format, the film was presented in a ""matted"" widescreen format for its original theatrical release, indicating that this was the form in which film's creators intended for the film to be viewed.  Thus, a widescreen presentation on DVD is mandatory as far as true film fans and cinematic purists are concerned, and Artisan should be ashamed of their reformatted digital offering.  Secondly, the digital transfer of the film is grainy and several filmic artifacts are noticeable.  The blurry quality caused by the graininess almost makes it seem as if the transfer was made from video tape rather than celluloid, and this is frankly unacceptable quality for the digital age.  And on top of all this, the disc offers absolutely nothing by way of bonus material.In short, FRIGHT NIGHT PART II is a fun and entertaining film that is remarkably high quality for a horror sequel.  However, the DVD from Artisan (Lionsgate/Fox) leaves a lot to be desired in terms of offerings and quality.  Alone, the film deserves a four-star rating.  But taking the overall quality of the disc into consideration, this DVD gets three stars.",3,Welcome to Fright Night...Again!,1099180800,"10 31, 2004",2004,2909,"['Counseling', 'convinced', 'Charley', 'Brewster', 'William', 'Ragsdale', 'hero', 'smash', 'flick', 'FRIGHT', 'NIGHT', '1985', 'vampires', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'friend', 'TV', 'horror', 'host', 'Peter', 'Vincent', 'Roddy', 'McDowall', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'kill', 'one', 'Charley', 'relapse', 'when', 'new', 'tenant', 'Peter', 'apartment', 'building', 'moving', 'lot', 'coffins', 'other', 'trappings', 'bloodsucking', 'lifestyle.Not', 'nearly', 'clever', 'as', 'slick', 'predecessor', 'FRIGHT', 'NIGHT', 'PART', 'II', 'still', 'entertaining', 'vampire', 'flick', 'will', 'please', 'fans', 'vampire', 'sub-genre', 'should', 'delight', 'fans', 'original', 'Most', 'elements', 'made', 'first', 'flick', 'success', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'rapport', 'Charley', 'Peter', 'Vincent', 'damsel', 'distress', 'alluring', 'powerful', 'vampire', 'time', 'played', 'Julie', 'Carmen', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'off-beat', 'humor', 'cool', 'special', 'FX', 'Noticeably', 'missing', 'Charley', 'best-friend-turned-vamp', 'Evil', 'Ed', 'Thompson', 'Stephen', 'Geoffreys', 'who', 'was', 'delightfully', 'over-the-top', 'comic', 'relief', 'first', 'flick', 'actor', 'Jon', 'Gries', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'scary', 'comical', 'character', 'FRIGHT', 'NIGHT', 'PART', 'II', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fully', 'fill', 'shoes', 'quirky', 'Geoffreys', 'Still', 'FRIGHT', 'NIGHT', 'PART', 'II', 'offer', 'chills', 'surprises', 'horror', 'sequels', 'go', 'top-notch', 'goods', 'desire.That', 'good', 'news', 'Now', 'bad.The', 'DVD', 'Artisan', 'Lionsgate/Fox', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'mainly', 'due', 'two', 'factors', 'First', 'film', 'offered', '1.33:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'sources', 'indicate', 'format', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'shot', 'other', 'sources', 'indicate', 'original', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'was', '2.35:1', 'Even', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'what', 'traditionally', 'called', 'full-screen', 'format', 'film', 'was', 'presented', 'matted', 'widescreen', 'format', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', 'indicating', 'was', 'form', 'film', 'creators', 'intended', 'film', 'be', 'viewed', 'Thus', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'DVD', 'mandatory', 'as', 'far', 'true', 'film', 'fans', 'cinematic', 'purists', 'are', 'concerned', 'Artisan', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'reformatted', 'digital', 'offering', 'Secondly', 'digital', 'transfer', 'film', 'grainy', 'several', 'filmic', 'artifacts', 'are', 'noticeable', 'blurry', 'quality', 'caused', 'graininess', 'almost', 'seem', 'transfer', 'was', 'made', 'video', 'tape', 'rather', 'celluloid', 'frankly', 'unacceptable', 'quality', 'digital', 'age', 'top', 'disc', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'way', 'bonus', 'material.In', 'short', 'FRIGHT', 'NIGHT', 'PART', 'II', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'film', 'remarkably', 'high', 'quality', 'horror', 'sequel', 'However', 'DVD', 'Artisan', 'Lionsgate/Fox', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'terms', 'offerings', 'quality', 'Alone', 'film', 'four-star', 'rating', 'taking', 'overall', 'quality', 'disc', 'consideration', 'DVD', 'three', 'stars']",Fright Night Part 2 VHS

Moade,"[0, 0]","Usually the ""unplanned"" sequel of a hit movie suck inasmuch as the producers found an unexpected hit and try to shake the money tree for a bit more.This is not true for Fright Night part 2. The sequel (based on the surprise hit of 1985) has a well thought out and believably based plot (at least for a vampire tale) and story line. In this case Regine is looking for vengeance in the destruction of her brother Jerry Dandridge in the previous film. She plans to exact this by turning Charlie Brewster (now in college) into a vampire himself and torturing him through eternity. While she reserves Charlie for herself, she has a troupe of other beasties and baddies which follow her around and generally cause mayhem wherever they go. These provide mostly for comic relief. The male sidekick catches bugs and just before devouring them gives the scientific name for each. Others may not appreciate the inserted humor, but I found that it added to the story. Sort of like the creator saying, ""Hey, this is just make believe, let's have some fun"". My favorite was the young guy w/ the sideburns who plays a hip vampire and tries to `make it' with Charlie's new girlfriend, Alex. One feels that he just recently became one of the undead and still wants to savor the life he once had (in a very clumsy way). Another reviewer says he came off as a dork. I personally think this is the impression he was intended to give.Julie Carmen gave a very nice performance as Regime. And of course, we have Roddy McDowell back as Peter Vincent, Vampire Killer. Once again, director Tommy Lee Wallace has done wonders with the effects and make-up.Others have commented on the generally poor quality of the DVD by Artisan. I am re-watching the disc now and do not consider the picture grainy or dark. Quality seems to be on par with most other DVD's I've seen (and I've seen a bunch of 'em). True, the DVD lacks any extras and the picture is full screen; but that is not a primary consideration in the quality of the product so far as I am concerned. The music that accompanies is haunting and appropriate.All things given, I believe that fans of the original Fright Night will definitely enjoy this unsung gem. Maybe not an academy award winner for horror flicks, but certainly entertaining and worth having in any gothic horror collection.Definitely Recommended (ages 10 and up)~P~",5,Highly Enjoyable for a Sequel,1176681600,"04 16, 2007",2007,2363,"['Usually', 'unplanned', 'sequel', 'hit', 'movie', 'suck', 'inasmuch', 'producers', 'found', 'unexpected', 'hit', 'try', 'shake', 'money', 'tree', 'bit', 'more.This', 'not', 'true', 'Fright', 'Night', 'part', '2', 'sequel', 'based', 'surprise', 'hit', '1985', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'believably', 'based', 'plot', 'least', 'vampire', 'tale', 'story', 'line', 'case', 'Regine', 'looking', 'vengeance', 'destruction', 'brother', 'Jerry', 'Dandridge', 'previous', 'film', 'exact', 'turning', 'Charlie', 'Brewster', 'now', 'college', 'vampire', 'torturing', 'eternity', 'reserves', 'Charlie', 'herself', 'troupe', 'other', 'beasties', 'baddies', 'follow', 'around', 'generally', 'cause', 'mayhem', 'go', 'provide', 'mostly', 'comic', 'relief', 'male', 'sidekick', 'catches', 'bugs', 'just', 'devouring', 'scientific', 'name', 'Others', 'may', 'not', 'appreciate', 'inserted', 'humor', 'found', 'added', 'story', 'Sort', 'creator', 'saying', 'Hey', 'just', 'make', 'believe', 'let', 'have', 'fun', 'favorite', 'was', 'young', 'guy', 'sideburns', 'who', 'hip', 'vampire', 'tries', 'make', 'Charlie', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Alex', 'One', 'just', 'recently', 'became', 'one', 'undead', 'still', 'savor', 'life', 'once', 'had', 'very', 'clumsy', 'way', 'reviewer', 'came', 'off', 'dork', 'personally', 'think', 'impression', 'was', 'intended', 'give.Julie', 'Carmen', 'gave', 'very', 'nice', 'performance', 'Regime', 'course', 'have', 'Roddy', 'McDowell', 'back', 'Peter', 'Vincent', 'Vampire', 'Killer', 'Once', 'again', 'director', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Wallace', 'done', 'wonders', 'effects', 'make-up.Others', 'have', 'commented', 'generally', 'poor', 'quality', 'DVD', 'Artisan', 'am', 're-watching', 'disc', 'now', 'do', 'not', 'consider', 'picture', 'grainy', 'dark', 'Quality', 'be', 'par', 'most', 'other', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'bunch', ""'em"", 'True', 'DVD', 'extras', 'picture', 'full', 'screen', 'not', 'primary', 'consideration', 'quality', 'product', 'so', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', 'music', 'haunting', 'appropriate.All', 'things', 'given', 'believe', 'fans', 'original', 'Fright', 'Night', 'will', 'definitely', 'enjoy', 'unsung', 'gem', 'Maybe', 'not', 'academy', 'award', 'winner', 'horror', 'flicks', 'certainly', 'entertaining', 'worth', 'having', 'gothic', 'horror', 'collection.Definitely', 'Recommended', '10', 'up', '~P~']",Fright Night Part 2 VHS

There is a great scene with Gries, Clark and Thompson bowling, including using the head of the bowling alley manager as a ball.This is one case of the sequel living up to the original and passing it at times.

252791,A96JD9312DHWC,6301435192,"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S""","[4, 7]","After dealing with one cast of vampires, you'd think that a person would have had enough excitement to last a lifetime, right? Well, in the case of Peter Vincent - Vampire Killer, and Charlie Bruster - Vampire Killer Admirer, you'd be right, but there's a little problem with that. When you find yourself entangled with one of a multiple undying brood, it can only be the beginning of a very long, very endearing nightmare. After finding himself in therapy for three years after his little ""outing"" with Jerry Dandridge, Charlie thinks himself cured of all his ailments. The delusions that led him to believe that Jerry was indeed a vampire and that group hypnosis that made he and Peter see the same things confirmed that fact, they have all been explained away and now he's on the road to recovery.  On this highway of discovery, he has forged himself a new life, taking on a newer, lovelier, girlfriend and finding that he now has something to look forward to besides thoughts of a high school mind and a bloodsucking neighbor living next door. Yes, he seems to have so much to look forward to. Unfortunately for him, in this series of newness, he has other things to look forward to, namely new vampiric admirers as well. And that type, well, they are the kind you never want to find.Before looking over both Fright Night and its sequel, Fright Night 2, one has to remember that (1) sequels are rarely the original in form and effect and (2) it is an odd event when the 2nd chapter in a series is anywhere near the first. The reason I say this is not to make excuses for the movie, however, but to say that this entry, it is an abnormality in the world of potential failures. Yes, in the case of Fright Night 2, there is a strange exception to that ruling on sequels because the movie is both commendable and it does hold its own in an arena clogged with many forms of disposable outings. In it, the theme of revenge is one that reigns supreme, with someone from Charlie and Peter's past, namely Dandridge, surfacing once more - but in a rather twisted manner. His revenge, it isn't in the atypical ""defying death"" arena that most films give you, but rather in the sense of having friends and family that live forever and those individuals taking it rather seriously when one of their own is ""dealt with.""  This is something that is welcome, a cast of faces that isn't the same person returning and being banished once more, and the methods they wish to adopt, while primed with ways to fail, are ones that are delightful. The original actors return in the starring roles, too, making things easy to keep up with, and the prosthetic effects are some of the better portions from the array of movies that flocked to the screen at the time. When you take all of that, blend it together, and think that vampires are going to run amok in a film that makes fun of films with vampires while using them, then you have a wonderful combination to the safe called ""comedy.""For anyone that missed the movie, enjoys the campiness that vampire films carry from that time frame, appreciates good effects alongside their vengeful motives, and is willing to find it on VHS (it has yet to make its way to DVD), then this would be something worth checking into. This is especially true for those who liked the first film and wanted to find it carrying on, with the unfortunately loss of everyone's favorite character; Evil.
