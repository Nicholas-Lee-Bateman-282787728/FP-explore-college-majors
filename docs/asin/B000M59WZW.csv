This is for those who have been working out for a while, and looking for high intense cardio.

We have and enjoy using several of his other DVD's but this one is so different because it is filmed on an aircraft carrier and helicopters are constantly landing and taking off and the photographer pans to them for a short period while you are doing the exercises.  The TIME went by SO fast  - we couldn't do the complete routine yet but went farther than we do with other DVD's because we stuck with it and enjoyed it at the same time.  We KNOW we had a great workout.  My husband was happy to be exercising with a man leading the ""non-girly"" routine.  Gilad is an inspiration and we are getting fit.

1043685,A2JE3ED40C5Q68,B000M59WZW,fluffysquirrel,"[0, 0]","I have been following Gilad's workout routines for years and have gotten some pretty decent results.  After awhile, though, I get too used to them and my body gets to comfortable with the moves and it's time to up the ante.  That is what Elite Forces does for me. The first time I used it, it was when it initially came out; about 7 years ago.  I was exhausted and put it away, feeling I wasn't ready for it.  I revisited it again recently when I was unable to make it to the gym as we had blizzard conditions.  I put this in the machine and had forgotten how intense it is.  Many have said that the moves are boring. I say they are basic, but effective. I had my Heart Rate Monitor on and saw that I got the same results as if I were in one of my spin classes.  That's a huge plus right there. Was I tired? Sure. I also wanted to stop in the middle of it and give up. I kept on going.  There is plyometrics, lots of jumping jacks, jumping rope, lunges, but you take little breaks and then before you know it, he's got your heart racing again. The perfect HIIT, if you ask me:)  Towards the end, there is a little bit of weight training focused on shoulders and biceps. I was surprised he didn't put in an ab workout--perhaps all the punching/kickboxing moves counted towards that.  If you are looking for a little more in the way of cardio, give this one a try. It's Gilad!!:)  He won't steer you wrong:)",5,What a workout;),1390694400,"01 26, 2014",2014,1405,"['have', 'been', 'following', 'Gilad', 'workout', 'routines', 'years', 'have', 'gotten', 'pretty', 'decent', 'results', 'awhile', 'get', 'too', 'used', 'body', 'comfortable', 'moves', 'time', 'up', 'ante', 'what', 'Elite', 'Forces', 'first', 'time', 'used', 'was', 'when', 'initially', 'came', 'out', '7', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'exhausted', 'put', 'away', 'feeling', 'was', ""n't"", 'ready', 'revisited', 'again', 'recently', 'when', 'was', 'unable', 'make', 'gym', 'had', 'blizzard', 'conditions', 'put', 'machine', 'had', 'forgotten', 'how', 'intense', 'Many', 'have', 'said', 'moves', 'are', 'boring', 'say', 'are', 'basic', 'effective', 'had', 'Heart', 'Rate', 'Monitor', 'saw', 'got', 'same', 'results', 'were', 'one', 'spin', 'classes', 'huge', 'right', 'there', 'Was', 'tired', 'Sure', 'also', 'wanted', 'stop', 'middle', 'give', 'up', 'kept', 'going', 'plyometrics', 'lots', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'jumping', 'rope', 'lunges', 'take', 'little', 'breaks', 'then', 'know', 'got', 'heart', 'racing', 'again', 'perfect', 'HIIT', 'ask', 'end', 'little', 'bit', 'weight', 'training', 'focused', 'shoulders', 'biceps', 'was', 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'ab', 'workout', 'perhaps', 'punching/kickboxing', 'moves', 'counted', 'towards', 'are', 'looking', 'little', 'more', 'way', 'cardio', 'give', 'one', 'try', 'Gilad', 'wo', ""n't"", 'steer', 'wrong']","Gilad Elite Forces, Fat Burning Workout"

Anyway, this is the second dvd of Gilad's that I've bought and I'm very impressed with it.It's a bootcamp kickboxing workout.  The exercisers are civillians and Navy sailors and Marines.  It's easy to follow, but it's no nonsense either just like you'd expect in a bootcamp workout.  There is the classic kickboxing type moves and a good amount of core workout too.  The moves are taught as basically as possible, and then he adds layers to these moves to make them more challenging.  All you really need is some weights and energy and you're good to go.The change of scenery is refreshing and Gilad's friendly (but very motivating) approach is just enough to push you through to the end.  He's a great instructor and based on this dvd, I'd go out and get more of his workouts.  I really like this one a lot.",5,Cool workout ;-O,1185321600,"07 25, 2007",2007,911,"['cool', 'dvd', 'workout', 'been', 'filmed', 'actual', 'US', 'Navy', 'aircraft', 'carrier', 'first', 'think', 'Anyway', 'second', 'dvd', 'Gilad', ""'ve"", 'bought', ""'m"", 'very', 'impressed', 'it.It', 'bootcamp', 'kickboxing', 'workout', 'exercisers', 'are', 'civillians', 'Navy', 'sailors', 'Marines', 'easy', 'follow', 'nonsense', 'either', 'just', ""'d"", 'expect', 'bootcamp', 'workout', 'classic', 'kickboxing', 'type', 'moves', 'good', 'amount', 'core', 'workout', 'too', 'moves', 'are', 'taught', 'as', 'basically', 'possible', 'then', 'layers', 'moves', 'make', 'more', 'challenging', 'really', 'need', 'weights', 'energy', ""'re"", 'good', 'go.The', 'change', 'scenery', 'refreshing', 'Gilad', 'friendly', 'very', 'motivating', 'approach', 'just', 'enough', 'push', 'end', 'great', 'instructor', 'based', 'dvd', ""'d"", 'go', 'out', 'get', 'more', 'workouts', 'really', 'one', 'lot']","Gilad Elite Forces, Fat Burning Workout"
1043687,A3NZVCL9N8CLHB,B000M59WZW,"Logical Paradox ""Irrational, but True""","[10, 10]","I work out about 30 minutes to an hour every day, and Gilad is my favorite fitness instructor and the hour-long (45 minutes w/o commercials) Total Body Sculpt episodes are a staple for me. I got this DVD because after years of the same workouts, I'm looking for something new to challenge my body and keep things from being so repetitive.The workout consists of a 9 minute warm-up, a 35 minute cardio segment, and a 9 minute strength training/stretch/cool down segment.  The cardio is mostly kickboxing with some plyometrics thrown in as well.PROs:Overall Gilad delivers in this one. While the majority of the workout consists of pretty basic moves, there were a few moves that were new and interesting to me. The workout itself is challenging and intense. I was dripping sweat and feeling great by the end. There's 35 minutes of straight cardio, which is kind of the opposite of his show which is more sculpting and only intervals of short, but intense cardio.  And it's almost all cardio kickboxing, which is my favorite. I give this DVD 5 stars because it was overall a very good workout and makes for a nice change from his show.CONs:While I enjoyed seeing a familiar face (the first thing I noticed was red-headed Arthur in the front row),  there's not as much of the banter and interaction with the other people as there is on his show, so it's less entertaining. My girlfriend and I still can't help but chuckle out loud when we workout to Total Body Sculpt and Gilad picks his team members . Fans of TBS will also notice a lot of familiar moves. The stretches in the warm-up, the cardio moves, and the strength moves are very similar if not exactly the same as moves used in his show. The cardio segment feels almost like they just took 3 or 4 TBS cardio segments and stitched the routines together with a few small twists and additions. If you love TBS and want more, then great. If you're really looking for something altogether new, look elsewhere.In addition, don't expect much strength/resistance training. You do some bicep curls, some shoulder presses, and a few lunges, but that's it (it's 10 minutes long and that INCLUDES the stretch and cool down). Depending on what you want, this could be a good thing or a bad thing.  Also, if you don't like cardio kickboxing, you'll be disappointed.  Still, it's effective and something a little new and different for me.THE BIGGEST CON:  THERE IS NO AB WORKOUT AT ALL.Yup, Gilad completely skips your core. Some will be very happy not to have to do a single crunch or sit-up, but ab work is vital to my workout routine. There's plenty of engaging the abs with the twisting and punching, but it's by no means equivalent to what you'd get from even 5 minutes of focused core work such as at the end of every other Gilad program I've seen. Big minus.BOTTOM LINE:I give this 5 stars because I'm more than happy to keep this one in my collection. But, I would strongly recommend first setting your VCR or DVR to record TBS on FitTV for FREE before you go dropping this much money on a single 55minute workout. If you're already a Gilad fan then see if this meets your needs and expectations. If you want more cardio kickboxing, then this is it. If you are looking more for sculpting or strength training, move on. If you want more of the same with some fresh twists, this is just what you need. If you want brand new moves, then you might want to keep looking.",5,Great Workout,1240358400,"04 22, 2009",2009,3413,"['work', 'out', '30', 'minutes', 'hour', 'day', 'Gilad', 'favorite', 'fitness', 'instructor', 'hour-long', '45', 'minutes', 'w/o', 'commercials', 'Total', 'Body', 'Sculpt', 'episodes', 'are', 'staple', 'got', 'DVD', 'years', 'same', 'workouts', ""'m"", 'looking', 'something', 'new', 'challenge', 'body', 'keep', 'things', 'being', 'so', 'repetitive.The', 'workout', '9', 'minute', 'warm-up', '35', 'minute', 'cardio', 'segment', '9', 'minute', 'strength', 'training/stretch/cool', 'down', 'segment', 'cardio', 'mostly', 'kickboxing', 'plyometrics', 'thrown', 'well.PROs', 'Overall', 'Gilad', 'delivers', 'one', 'majority', 'workout', 'pretty', 'basic', 'moves', 'were', 'few', 'moves', 'were', 'new', 'interesting', 'workout', 'challenging', 'intense', 'was', 'dripping', 'sweat', 'feeling', 'great', 'end', '35', 'minutes', 'straight', 'cardio', 'kind', 'opposite', 'show', 'more', 'sculpting', 'only', 'intervals', 'short', 'intense', 'cardio', 'almost', 'cardio', 'kickboxing', 'favorite', 'give', 'DVD', '5', 'stars', 'was', 'overall', 'very', 'good', 'workout', 'nice', 'change', 'show.CONs', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'familiar', 'face', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'was', 'red-headed', 'Arthur', 'front', 'row', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'banter', 'interaction', 'other', 'people', 'show', 'less', 'entertaining', 'girlfriend', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'chuckle', 'out', 'loud', 'when', 'workout', 'Total', 'Body', 'Sculpt', 'Gilad', 'team', 'members', 'Fans', 'TBS', 'will', 'also', 'notice', 'lot', 'familiar', 'moves', 'stretches', 'warm-up', 'cardio', 'moves', 'strength', 'moves', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'not', 'exactly', 'same', 'moves', 'used', 'show', 'cardio', 'segment', 'almost', 'just', 'took', '3', '4', 'TBS', 'cardio', 'segments', 'stitched', 'routines', 'together', 'few', 'small', 'twists', 'additions', 'love', 'TBS', 'want', 'more', 'then', 'great', ""'re"", 'really', 'looking', 'something', 'altogether', 'new', 'look', 'elsewhere.In', 'addition', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'strength/resistance', 'training', 'do', 'bicep', 'curls', 'shoulder', 'presses', 'few', 'lunges', '10', 'minutes', 'long', 'stretch', 'cool', 'down', 'Depending', 'want', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'bad', 'thing', 'Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'cardio', 'kickboxing', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'Still', 'effective', 'something', 'little', 'new', 'different', 'me.THE', 'BIGGEST', 'CON', 'NO', 'AB', 'WORKOUT', 'AT', 'ALL.Yup', 'Gilad', 'completely', 'core', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'happy', 'not', 'have', 'do', 'single', 'crunch', 'sit-up', 'ab', 'work', 'vital', 'workout', 'routine', 'plenty', 'engaging', 'abs', 'twisting', 'punching', 'means', 'equivalent', 'what', ""'d"", 'get', 'even', '5', 'minutes', 'focused', 'core', 'work', 'such', 'end', 'other', 'Gilad', 'program', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Big', 'minus.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'give', '5', 'stars', ""'m"", 'more', 'happy', 'keep', 'one', 'collection', 'would', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'first', 'setting', 'VCR', 'DVR', 'record', 'TBS', 'FitTV', 'FREE', 'go', 'dropping', 'much', 'money', 'single', '55minute', 'workout', ""'re"", 'already', 'Gilad', 'fan', 'then', 'see', 'needs', 'expectations', 'want', 'more', 'cardio', 'kickboxing', 'then', 'are', 'looking', 'more', 'sculpting', 'strength', 'training', 'move', 'want', 'more', 'same', 'fresh', 'twists', 'just', 'what', 'need', 'want', 'brand', 'new', 'moves', 'then', 'might', 'want', 'keep', 'looking']","Gilad Elite Forces, Fat Burning Workout"
