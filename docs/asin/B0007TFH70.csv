889116,AXMKAXC0TR9AW,B0007TFH70,"Bill Emblom ""Bill Emblom""","[16, 17]",I am very pleased with this DVD.  It includes all the hit songs that Gary Lewis is connected with in addition to brief comments between songs by Gary regarding the upcoming song.  The ending has a funny rendition between Jerry Lewis and his father doing Sonny Boy.  A special feature section includes an interview with Gary in addition to Jerry and Gary repeating the Sonny Boy routine that was done at the end of the main program between Jerry and his father.  If you enjoy Gary Lewis's singing you will enjoy this DVD.  The entire performance lasts approximately 45 minutes.,5,Contains All The Hit Songs And Interviews,1120176000,"07 1, 2005",2005,576,"['am', 'very', 'pleased', 'DVD', 'hit', 'songs', 'Gary', 'Lewis', 'connected', 'addition', 'brief', 'comments', 'songs', 'Gary', 'regarding', 'upcoming', 'song', 'ending', 'funny', 'rendition', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'father', 'doing', 'Sonny', 'Boy', 'special', 'feature', 'section', 'interview', 'Gary', 'addition', 'Jerry', 'Gary', 'repeating', 'Sonny', 'Boy', 'routine', 'was', 'done', 'end', 'main', 'program', 'Jerry', 'father', 'enjoy', 'Gary', 'Lewis', 'singing', 'will', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'entire', 'performance', 'approximately', '45', 'minutes']",N/A

This DVD is of the older/current Gary Lewis and the Playboys, with Gary reviewing the group's career from its early beginnings to the point this DVD was produced. It is a combination of old videos and the current group preforming. I am glad that I bought it, being a long time fan of the group, and if you are as well, then this is for you too. Just be sure you understand that this is not a concert or collection of concerts of the original group only, but a history, containing performances by both the original group and the current group.",4,A Nice Collection,1402876800,"06 16, 2014",2014,599,"['First', 'let', 'make', 'sure', 'know', 'what', 'not', 'DVD', 'older/current', 'Gary', 'Lewis', 'Playboys', 'Gary', 'reviewing', 'group', 'career', 'early', 'beginnings', 'point', 'DVD', 'was', 'produced', 'combination', 'old', 'videos', 'current', 'group', 'preforming', 'am', 'glad', 'bought', 'being', 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'group', 'are', 'as', 'well', 'then', 'too', 'Just', 'be', 'sure', 'understand', 'not', 'concert', 'collection', 'concerts', 'original', 'group', 'only', 'history', 'containing', 'performances', 'original', 'group', 'current', 'group']",N/A
