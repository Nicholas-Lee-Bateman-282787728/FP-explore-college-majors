I joined the story in progress, and it seemed frankly, kind of flakey.  But, I decided to give this show a viewing from the beginning.  When I started I was ready to give it about 15-20 mins, but as the story unfolded I found myself starting to wonder just how all of this is going go work out.OK, here's the set-up.  A young man returns to his ancestral home where his hermit-like younger brother spends all of his time in the woods with a gaggle of oriental friends working on developing an arboretum.  At the same time, an elderly uncle who is extremely philosophical and often speaks in riddles or parables spends his time apparently sabotaging the young man's plans for a get-rich-quick scheme.  The young man, in the meantime is trying to make some cash to save his strange, eclectic family.  All he has to do that with is a valuable wine collection.  His plan is to sell the wine and use the cash to buy a nearby mine that he hopes will be the answer to his family's cash problems.The young man's fiance, a rich Minnie Driver, shows up for a weekend with a friend, and there you go...that's the set-up.This is a highly watchable film, but it actually takes some getting used to, and I'm here to tell you that you will really be pleased with how everything works out.There are surprising plot twists in what can only be called an existentialist romantic comedy.4 stars.",4,A quirky storyline that grows on you if you give it a chance,1319414400,"10 24, 2011",2011,1496,"['happened', 'movie', 'number', 'years', 'ago', 'surfing', 'channels', 'watched', 'maybe', '15-20', 'mins', 'then', 'bailed', 'joined', 'story', 'progress', 'seemed', 'frankly', 'kind', 'flakey', 'decided', 'give', 'show', 'viewing', 'beginning', 'When', 'started', 'was', 'ready', 'give', '15-20', 'mins', 'story', 'unfolded', 'found', 'starting', 'wonder', 'just', 'how', 'going', 'go', 'work', 'out.OK', 'here', 'set-up', 'young', 'man', 'ancestral', 'home', 'where', 'hermit-like', 'younger', 'brother', 'time', 'woods', 'gaggle', 'oriental', 'friends', 'working', 'developing', 'arboretum', 'same', 'time', 'elderly', 'uncle', 'who', 'extremely', 'philosophical', 'often', 'riddles', 'parables', 'time', 'apparently', 'sabotaging', 'young', 'man', 'plans', 'get-rich-quick', 'scheme', 'young', 'man', 'meantime', 'trying', 'make', 'cash', 'save', 'strange', 'eclectic', 'family', 'do', 'valuable', 'wine', 'collection', 'plan', 'sell', 'wine', 'use', 'cash', 'buy', 'nearby', 'mine', 'will', 'be', 'answer', 'family', 'cash', 'problems.The', 'young', 'man', 'fiance', 'rich', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'up', 'weekend', 'friend', 'there', 'go', 'set-up.This', 'highly', 'watchable', 'film', 'actually', 'getting', 'used', ""'m"", 'here', 'tell', 'will', 'really', 'be', 'pleased', 'how', 'everything', 'out.There', 'are', 'surprising', 'plot', 'twists', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'called', 'existentialist', 'romantic', 'comedy.4', 'stars']",N/A
672187,A3GKZ44Q9GO8QZ,B00005OBAK,"Colleen Whalen ""Tiger Lilly""","[4, 20]","Despite the fact that I am a HUGE Rufus Sewell fan - this film was atrocious. The plot revolves around an oddball family of slackers who never held ""real jobs"". Nephew Ross constantly complians that his old uncle Cullen was a spoiled trust fund kid who lived off family money. But Nephew Ross also never was able to hold a ""real job"" and repeatedly loss huge sums of money in hare-brained investments. So what is the point?The film is racist against Asians. There are approximately 15 Asian actors in this film and none of them ever speak - just state mutely into space without any dialogue. The only Asian actor that speaks, Mr. Tang does a cornball, hoky song on the guitar and behaves like a buffoon.Inane, slowly paced plot with stilted dialogue. The most annoying thing about this film is 30% of it is shots of the actors without any dialogue just staring into space, or gazing at other actors without any dialogue, far too many very long shots of scenery, buildings and landscapes....none of those VERY LONG shots do absolutely nothing to advance the plot or build character development.Rufus Sewell, Minnie Driver and Nigel Davenport are all highly respected actors - but the script is boring, direction is weak and the film just plods along. The entire supporting cast are untalented unknowns who were probably cast in their roles because they would work for union scale.The only reason to purchase this film is if you are a big Rufus Sewell fan and just enjoy watching him in a bad film for his gorgeous, hunky ""eye-candy"" appeal. Sewell does an admirable job trying to elevate this insipid film, but even his world class acting skills cannot do much for ""Uncorked"". In order to make this film bearable, I simply fast-forwarded skipping all the scenes that did not have Rufus Sewell.  The sound track is lovely - Rufus Sewell and the sound track are the only thing that makes it bearable to watch.This is a ""straight to video"" type film that gets pulled from first run theaters after the first weekend and goes straight to cable.",1,Uncorked,1095033600,"09 13, 2004",2004,2038,"['fact', 'am', 'HUGE', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'fan', 'film', 'was', 'atrocious', 'plot', 'oddball', 'family', 'slackers', 'who', 'never', 'held', 'real', 'jobs', 'Nephew', 'Ross', 'constantly', 'old', 'uncle', 'Cullen', 'was', 'spoiled', 'trust', 'fund', 'kid', 'who', 'lived', 'off', 'family', 'money', 'Nephew', 'Ross', 'also', 'never', 'was', 'able', 'hold', 'real', 'job', 'repeatedly', 'loss', 'huge', 'sums', 'money', 'hare-brained', 'investments', 'what', 'point', 'film', 'racist', 'Asians', 'are', 'approximately', '15', 'Asian', 'actors', 'film', 'none', 'ever', 'speak', 'just', 'state', 'mutely', 'space', 'dialogue', 'only', 'Asian', 'actor', 'Mr.', 'Tang', 'cornball', 'hoky', 'song', 'guitar', 'behaves', 'buffoon.Inane', 'slowly', 'paced', 'plot', 'stilted', 'dialogue', 'most', 'annoying', 'thing', 'film', '30', '%', 'shots', 'actors', 'dialogue', 'just', 'staring', 'space', 'gazing', 'other', 'actors', 'dialogue', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'very', 'long', 'shots', 'scenery', 'buildings', 'landscapes', '.none', 'VERY', 'LONG', 'shots', 'do', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'advance', 'plot', 'build', 'character', 'development.Rufus', 'Sewell', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'Nigel', 'Davenport', 'are', 'highly', 'respected', 'actors', 'script', 'boring', 'direction', 'weak', 'film', 'just', 'plods', 'along', 'entire', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'untalented', 'unknowns', 'who', 'were', 'probably', 'cast', 'roles', 'would', 'work', 'union', 'scale.The', 'only', 'reason', 'purchase', 'film', 'are', 'big', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'fan', 'just', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'bad', 'film', 'gorgeous', 'hunky', 'eye-candy', 'appeal', 'Sewell', 'admirable', 'job', 'trying', 'elevate', 'insipid', 'film', 'even', 'world', 'class', 'acting', 'skills', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'much', 'Uncorked', 'order', 'make', 'film', 'bearable', 'simply', 'fast-forwarded', 'skipping', 'scenes', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'sound', 'track', 'lovely', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'sound', 'track', 'are', 'only', 'thing', 'bearable', 'watch.This', 'straight', 'video', 'type', 'film', 'pulled', 'first', 'run', 'theaters', 'first', 'weekend', 'straight', 'cable']",N/A
672188,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B00005OBAK,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[12, 14]","Ross (Rufus Sewell) is about to make a fortune.  He plans to sell all the collected bottles of wine bequeathed to him by his Uncle Cullen, the proceeds of which he will use to buy a manganese mine three miles west of the many-acre Satchem Farm they own.  He will become financially solvent, and will be able to marry his girlfriend Kendal, who arrives on the farm with a quiet but pretty friend, Laurie, whom Cullen describes as &quot;the girl with the young eyes but old soul.&quot;  Laurie's quiet, reserved, very pretty, and has a very nice smile.The title action occurs, thanks to Uncle Cullen, and deliberately it seems, and that appears to be the end of Ross's dream to get somewhere in life, as home insurance does not cover senility.  Ross feels the need to be responsible, as his hermit-like brother Paul lives in the arboretum, planting trees with a bunch of H'mong, a peaceful arboreal people hailing from Laos.Kendal has been patient, loving, and exasperated with Ross, but she's more a clear, organized person who thinks Ross should get his priorities straight.  She does sympathize with him though, telling Laurie that everything Ross does is &quot;like a perversion of the law of physics.  The harder he works, the less he gets out of it.&quot;Everybody thinks Cullen has gone around the bend when he has a twenty cubit high (about twenty-eight feet) Greek pillar made of titanium and plexiglass installed in the yard overlooking the woods, and in one of the movie's highlights, proceeds to perch himself atop it a la St. Simeon, who did so in the fifth century as an ascetic practice of achieving enlightenment.  Well, everybody except Laurie.  He spends the second half of the film on that perch.However, Cullen is far from senile.  As he tells Kendal, &quot;life has a long experience of suffering, disappointments, and chaos, but the moment you stop squirming against the catastrophe of being alive, music flies out of the dog doo.&quot;  But his most important pearls of wisdom are for his nephew, whom he wants to learn what he was put on earth for.  What are his special gifts?  To this, he enlists the aid of Laurie and Kendal.Other characters include Tom, a former Olympic contender whose career ended when he tripped on his shoelace and broke his ankle.  He spends his days diving, his interface to the real world thus severed, and barely says a word, especially to his former flame Kendal, who turned to Ross when Tom cut off communication with her.The best performance and lines comes from Nigel Hawthorne (Cullen) hands down, playing an eccentric, idealistic, and ultimately cleverly strategic old man who's got a lot of perspective in life.  As Kendal tells him, &quot;Satchem Farm ...is a growing collection of hermetically sealed neurotics and the not so funny part is the common denominator is you.&quot;  Such a far cry from the devious Sir Humphrey Appleby in Yes Minister and Yes, Prime Minister.  He delivers the funniest line regarding a character:  &quot;His karma was constipated.  I gave him an enema.&quot;Laurie is played by Amelia Heinle, who bears a strong resemblance to Denise Richards.  Her quiet, reserved manner, warm and compassionate smile really make Cullen's description of her as the girl with &quot;young eyes with an old soul&quot; appropriate.  It's her quiet but potent presence and role that makes her outshine Minnie Driver (Kendal), who herself is good in this movie.Keone Yong (Harrison Tang, the wine dealer) has an amusing moment where he plays guitar and sings a funny song in Chinese.  His performance either bemuses or dumbfounds his listeners.  Michael A Rodgers stands out as Paul, the arboreal hermit brother of Ross.As Ross says in an onscreen narration, it's &quot;so easy to lose perspective on life.  It's also not hard as you think to get your perspective back.&quot;  And this quirky film with its oddballs is a ticklish but heartwarming vintage.",5,A quirky funny vintage with lots of perspective,1072828800,"12 31, 2003",2003,3922,"['Ross', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'make', 'fortune', 'sell', 'collected', 'bottles', 'wine', 'bequeathed', 'Uncle', 'Cullen', 'proceeds', 'will', 'use', 'buy', 'manganese', 'mine', 'three', 'miles', 'west', 'many-acre', 'Satchem', 'Farm', 'own', 'will', 'become', 'financially', 'solvent', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'marry', 'girlfriend', 'Kendal', 'who', 'farm', 'quiet', 'pretty', 'friend', 'Laurie', 'whom', 'Cullen', 'quot', 'girl', 'young', 'eyes', 'old', 'soul.', 'quot', 'Laurie', 'quiet', 'reserved', 'very', 'pretty', 'very', 'nice', 'smile.The', 'title', 'action', 'thanks', 'Uncle', 'Cullen', 'deliberately', 'be', 'end', 'Ross', 'dream', 'get', 'somewhere', 'life', 'home', 'insurance', 'not', 'cover', 'senility', 'Ross', 'need', 'be', 'responsible', 'hermit-like', 'brother', 'Paul', 'arboretum', 'planting', 'trees', 'bunch', ""H'mong"", 'peaceful', 'arboreal', 'people', 'hailing', 'Laos.Kendal', 'been', 'patient', 'loving', 'exasperated', 'Ross', 'more', 'clear', 'organized', 'person', 'who', 'Ross', 'should', 'get', 'priorities', 'straight', 'sympathize', 'telling', 'Laurie', 'everything', 'Ross', 'quot', 'perversion', 'law', 'physics', 'harder', 'less', 'it.', 'quot', 'Everybody', 'Cullen', 'gone', 'bend', 'when', 'twenty', 'cubit', 'high', 'twenty-eight', 'feet', 'Greek', 'pillar', 'made', 'titanium', 'plexiglass', 'installed', 'yard', 'overlooking', 'woods', 'one', 'movie', 'highlights', 'proceeds', 'perch', 'atop', 'la', 'St.', 'Simeon', 'who', 'did', 'so', 'fifth', 'century', 'ascetic', 'practice', 'achieving', 'enlightenment', 'Well', 'everybody', 'Laurie', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'perch.However', 'Cullen', 'far', 'senile', 'Kendal', 'quot', 'life', 'long', 'experience', 'suffering', 'disappointments', 'chaos', 'moment', 'stop', 'squirming', 'catastrophe', 'being', 'alive', 'music', 'flies', 'dog', 'doo.', 'quot', 'most', 'important', 'pearls', 'wisdom', 'are', 'nephew', 'whom', 'learn', 'what', 'was', 'put', 'earth', 'What', 'are', 'special', 'gifts', 'aid', 'Laurie', 'Kendal.Other', 'characters', 'include', 'Tom', 'former', 'Olympic', 'contender', 'career', 'ended', 'when', 'tripped', 'shoelace', 'broke', 'ankle', 'days', 'diving', 'interface', 'real', 'world', 'thus', 'severed', 'barely', 'word', 'especially', 'former', 'flame', 'Kendal', 'who', 'turned', 'Ross', 'when', 'Tom', 'cut', 'off', 'communication', 'her.The', 'best', 'performance', 'lines', 'Nigel', 'Hawthorne', 'Cullen', 'down', 'playing', 'eccentric', 'idealistic', 'ultimately', 'cleverly', 'strategic', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'got', 'lot', 'perspective', 'life', 'Kendal', 'quot', 'Satchem', 'Farm', 'growing', 'collection', 'hermetically', 'sealed', 'neurotics', 'not', 'so', 'funny', 'part', 'common', 'denominator', 'you.', 'quot', 'far', 'cry', 'devious', 'Sir', 'Humphrey', 'Appleby', 'Yes', 'Minister', 'Yes', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'funniest', 'line', 'regarding', 'character', 'quot', 'karma', 'was', 'constipated', 'gave', 'enema.', 'quot', 'Laurie', 'played', 'Amelia', 'Heinle', 'who', 'strong', 'resemblance', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'quiet', 'reserved', 'manner', 'warm', 'compassionate', 'smile', 'really', 'make', 'Cullen', 'description', 'girl', 'quot', 'young', 'eyes', 'old', 'soul', 'quot', 'appropriate', 'quiet', 'potent', 'presence', 'role', 'outshine', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'Kendal', 'who', 'good', 'movie.Keone', 'Yong', 'Harrison', 'Tang', 'wine', 'dealer', 'amusing', 'moment', 'where', 'guitar', 'funny', 'song', 'Chinese', 'performance', 'bemuses', 'listeners', 'Michael', 'A', 'Rodgers', 'out', 'Paul', 'arboreal', 'hermit', 'brother', 'Ross.As', 'Ross', 'onscreen', 'narration', 'quot', 'so', 'easy', 'lose', 'perspective', 'life', 'also', 'not', 'hard', 'think', 'get', 'perspective', 'back.', 'quot', 'quirky', 'film', 'oddballs', 'ticklish', 'heartwarming', 'vintage']",N/A

672192,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005OBAK,Reviewer,"[9, 11]","Question:  Why does a holy man sit alone atop a mountain?  Answer:  To gain perspective.  Which in the end is what this film is all about-- finding the right perspective on life; figuring out what it is you were truly meant to do or be.  And it points out nicely that the wisest among us are often the very ones we are prone to ignore or dismiss out-of-hand.  ""Uncorked,"" directed by John Huddles, is a small film that in the end has a substantial message that is almost profound in it's simplicity.  Nothing new, perhaps, but something that so many people in our fast food generation fail to recognize or embrace, so this film actually serves as something of a wake-up call to those who have unknowingly lost that all-important perspective, and need it--whether they know it or not.The story takes place at Sachem Farm (which could be anywhere in the world), where Ross (Rufus Sewell) lives with his Uncle Cullen (Nigel Hawthorne) and his brother, Paul (Michael Rodgers), though Paul is something of a hermit and prefers to live in the forests and fields that surround the farm, cultivating gardens out of the wilderness.  Ross's girlfriend, Kendal (Minnie Driver), along with her friend, Laurie (Amelia Heinle) arrives for a stay at a very interesting time:  Ross is about to conclude a deal that will finance his dream of buying and working a nearby magnesium mine, in which he sees his future and fortune awaiting.  Circumstances instigated by Uncle Cullen, however, interfere; the situation turns bad, then gets worse, with the arrival of a pillar-- specially ordered by Cullen and standing at a height of twenty cubits (yes, he specifically ordered it in cubits)-- atop which Cullen subsequently takes up residence, without any intention of ever coming back down.  The reclusive Paul, meanwhile, continues to work on his gardens, and Kendal encounters an old flame, Tom (Gregory Sporleder), a neighbor and former high-diver whose dreams of gold were abruptly ended some years before by a broken ankle, and who now spends his time at the lake, obsessed with regaining his form.  It's an eclectic bunch, to say the least, not to mention eccentric; and Ross feels it has fallen to him to set the lives of those around him aright.  To which each, in turn, say to him in their own way:  ""Good luck.""  And such is life on Sachem Farm.Huddles, who also wrote the story and screenplay, has crafted and delivered a quaint, quirky and somewhat insightful film, which he presents rather artistically, though at a pace that leaves something to be desired, at least early on.  At times he allows the eye of the camera to roam, lending some quite interesting visual perspectives to the film (such as a moving overhead shot of Cullen atop his pillar), which he combines with different speeds and some jump cuts that are very effective.  There are moments, though, when the action seems a bit too ""staged,"" and makes you aware that these are actors playing  parts, which tends to take you out of the story.  But there are also moments that are extremely engaging-- often humorous and sometimes rather poignant-- that make the whole experience worthwhile.  The early part of the film tends to stall and initially seems in need of a destination, but it finds soon enough, and eventually takes you in a direction that is unexpected, but rewarding.As Cullen, Nigel Hawthorne is subtly flamboyant, creating a very detailed and three-dimensional character who very gradually draws you in as the story unfolds.  And, interestingly enough, as the character develops-- and quite nicely-- he doesn't change, though the viewer's perspective of him does; and as that perspective on Cullen shifts, it puts the story in a new light, as well.  Slowly, the true meaning of what is happening on Sachem Farm begins to emerge, and that deliberate pace set by Huddles that seemed off-putting at first actually facilitates an understanding of the situation at hand.  And Cullen-- especially because of Hawthorne's fine performance-- becomes a pivotal element that gives focus to this new perspective.  Huddles may have come up a bit short of attaining the emotional involvement and the connection with the audience to which he aspired, but by the end you realize there was a method to his madness, and it actually worked fairly well.Minnie Driver (who served as executive producer of this film, along with her sister, Kate, as well as Hawthorne), does a good job as Kendal, though you get the feeling her character is there mainly to support the story rather than add to it, and serves primarily as a tool to move it all along, as her connection with Tom-- and even Ross-- is a fairly minor part of the plot.  Kendal, as well as Laurie, are the two characters you're left wanting to know more about, in fact.Rufus Sewell gives a good, extremely natural performance as Ross, but it's one of those roles that tends to be taken for granted because it is played so effectively, like DiCaprio in ""Titanic"" or Gable in ""Gone With the Wind.""  It's a matter of not receiving the acclaim that is due simply because the job has been done so well.  This film is on a much smaller scale, of course, but the situation is the same.  And looking at it objectively, Sewell does an outstanding job here.The supporting cast includes Keone Young (Mr. Tang), Elizabeth Tsing (Maya) and Chalvay Srichoom (Cha).  They may not have lined up the Oscars for this one, but nevertheless, ""Uncorked"" has merit in it's subtle message, and for a pleasant diversion is definitely worth a look.  Huddles certainly doesn't drive home his point with a hammer, and it may take you a while to digest it all, but after awhile you may find yourself reflecting a bit and saying, ""Yeah, okay...I get it--""  And that's the magic of the movies.",3,Interesting Little Film,1012780800,"02 4, 2002",2002,5771,"['Question', 'Why', 'holy', 'man', 'sit', 'alone', 'mountain', 'Answer', 'gain',
