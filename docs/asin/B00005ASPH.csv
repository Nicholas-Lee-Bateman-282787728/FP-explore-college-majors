He cruises a gay pick-up spot but rejects the advances of an adult, but only after following him to a motel room.  He then cruises a teen haunt and pals with a mixed race guy who harbors his own demons.  They steal his family's boat and have an adventure, but never truly connect.  In the end there is a murder and a shower scene in the nude, but they only add to the confusing, surreal tale that is The Delta.

I would not even give it the star I gave it...but had to rate it somehow...which is why it got the one star.  The actors are boring...the plot ( what plot ??? ) is nonexistent...everything about this movie sucks!  Don't waste your money on this one...I got rid of my copy...would never watch this kind of inept film again.

We have some characters, but we really don't have a chance to know them. To learn something about them.Yet again a movie, where all gays pictured, aren't likable. One is a closet case, straight? bi? I haven't the foggiest.The second becomes a killer, after being rejected...It's one of the films that won't do good to gay community.Above all of that, the quality of sound and picture is really poor.

578660,ADK5CSMBXHIL8,B00005ASPH,"T. Halkin ""Tim""","[12, 18]","A muddled and insulting film. Low budget doesn't have to have an influence on the script or how a film is directed. The problem with this film is certainly not its low production value. In a day and age where discussions are taking place in the top ranks of the US government about changing the constitution to officially discriminate against, gays, we certainly don't need people out of our own ranks creating pieces of entertainment, which show gays as purely dysfunctional human beings.In The Delta, we have two very vague character studies: one of a 17 year old, upper middle-class kid who vacillates between seeming perfectly happy in his heterosexuality and going out to pick up guys. We never understand this character. There doesn't seem to be any conflict even though his situation screams out for it.  Shayne Gray is charming, but that doesn't help a script, which was doomed before it was filmed.  The other character is a bitter and confused Vietnamese/American/black man, who claims to search for love, but turns to a murderer, when the young man abandons him. We are left with his act of murder without ever understanding what drove him to it, or what really makes this person tick.  After 95 minutes it simply ends and you are none the wiser why it was even written.Verdict: it puts gay film-making back 25 to 30 years.",1,Another example of gays being depicted as social misfits,1077753600,"02 26, 2004",2004,1334,"['muddled', 'insulting', 'film', 'Low', 'budget', ""n't"", 'have', 'have', 'influence', 'script', 'how', 'film', 'directed', 'problem', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'low', 'production', 'value', 'day', 'age', 'where', 'discussions', 'are', 'taking', 'place', 'top', 'ranks', 'US', 'government', 'changing', 'constitution', 'officially', 'discriminate', 'gays', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'people', 'own', 'ranks', 'creating', 'pieces', 'entertainment', 'show', 'gays', 'purely', 'dysfunctional', 'human', 'Delta', 'have', 'two', 'very', 'vague', 'character', 'studies', 'one', '17', 'year', 'old', 'upper', 'middle-class', 'kid', 'who', 'seeming', 'perfectly', 'happy', 'heterosexuality', 'going', 'pick', 'up', 'guys', 'never', 'understand', 'character', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'conflict', 'even', 'situation', 'out', 'Shayne', 'Gray', 'charming', ""n't"", 'help', 'script', 'was', 'doomed', 'was', 'filmed', 'other', 'character', 'bitter', 'confused', 'Vietnamese/American/black', 'man', 'who', 'search', 'love', 'murderer', 'when', 'young', 'man', 'are', 'left', 'act', 'murder', 'ever', 'understanding', 'what', 'drove', 'what', 'really', 'person', 'tick', '95', 'minutes', 'simply', 'are', 'none', 'wiser', 'why', 'was', 'even', 'written.Verdict', 'gay', 'film-making', 'back', '25', '30', 'years']",N/A

Chan plays John or Minh Nguyen, a half Vietnamese half African American.This movie really needs English subtitles so that the viewer can know what Chan is saying as well as some of the other actors whose voices are drowned out.One synopsis said that Shayne Gray who plays Lincoln Bloom is a handsome student ""from a wealthy Jewish family.""  I saw nothing in the movie that indicated that Lincoln was Jewish or from a wealthy family.  He drove a run down older car.
