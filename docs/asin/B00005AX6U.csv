579489,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B00005AX6U,Artist & Author,"[1, 1]","If you are a Christian and like action movies, this is a movie for you.  There are car chaces, foot chases, criminal violence and most everything one would expect in a typical Hollywood action movie - except that there is no bad language.  This isn't a movie for preteen kids.  I would say that this is the best Christian oriented action movie so far.When most Christians in Christian movies are obnoxiously religious, it is refreshing to see a completely different portrayal of believers.  Indeed, there are four Christians portrayed in this movies, and each is at a different level of belief.  The seminary student about to be ordained loves the Lord, but he is not completely sure in his belief and lets his emotions get in the way at times.  The police officer is a lay person who is sure of his belief, and willing to just 'be there' for others who need him.  The student's girlfriend seems to be mostly a nominal Christian.  And the pastor played by Stacy Keach is a mature Christian, wise in his approach to counseling.I probably should also mention that this movie is well within the standards of Hollywood movie making.  It probably has the most stunts of any Christian theme movie.  In short, it is a very exciting movie that could have been just another 'good brother, bad brother' movie, but it rises well above the ordinary with new and refreshing plot twists.[To 'No Truth Here,' I wonder if you missed the part of the movie where Stacy Keach was counseling  Jeremiah.  If that isn't a solid Christian message, what is?  It may not be 'the Baptist' or some other Fundamentalist message, but it certainly is well established Biblical truth.]",5,"Finally, a Christian Action Movie",1211328000,"05 21, 2008",2008,1654,"['are', 'Christian', 'like', 'action', 'movies', 'movie', 'are', 'car', 'chaces', 'foot', 'chases', 'criminal', 'violence', 'most', 'everything', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'movie', 'bad', 'language', ""n't"", 'movie', 'preteen', 'kids', 'would', 'say', 'best', 'Christian', 'oriented', 'action', 'movie', 'so', 'far.When', 'most', 'Christians', 'Christian', 'movies', 'are', 'obnoxiously', 'religious', 'refreshing', 'see', 'completely', 'different', 'portrayal', 'believers', 'Indeed', 'are', 'four', 'Christians', 'portrayed', 'movies', 'different', 'level', 'belief', 'seminary', 'student', 'be', 'ordained', 'Lord', 'not', 'completely', 'sure', 'belief', 'emotions', 'get', 'way', 'times', 'police', 'officer', 'lay', 'person', 'who', 'sure', 'belief', 'willing', 'just', ""'be"", 'others', 'who', 'need', 'student', 'girlfriend', 'be', 'mostly', 'nominal', 'Christian', 'pastor', 'played', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'mature', 'Christian', 'wise', 'approach', 'counseling.I', 'probably', 'should', 'also', 'mention', 'movie', 'well', 'standards', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'making', 'probably', 'most', 'stunts', 'Christian', 'theme', 'movie', 'short', 'very', 'exciting', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'just', ""'good"", 'brother', 'bad', 'brother', 'movie', 'well', 'ordinary', 'new', 'refreshing', 'plot', 'twists', '[', ""'No"", 'Truth', 'Here', 'wonder', 'missed', 'part', 'movie', 'where', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'was', 'counseling', 'Jeremiah', ""n't"", 'solid', 'Christian', 'message', 'what', 'may', 'not', 'be', ""'the"", 'Baptist', 'other', 'Fundamentalist', 'message', 'certainly', 'well', 'established', 'Biblical', 'truth', ']']",N/A

Overall I thought it was very good and I liked it - I especially like the David White / Kevin Downes creative team.The plot was a stretch and difficult to follow in places, but David White's acting pulled it off well.The opening scene was intriguing and hooked me immediately.  However when the movie caught up with it's opening scene chronologically, instead of it being an ""Oh!-I-Get-It!"" moment - it seemed anti-climactic when you hear the rest of the dialog at that point.The ""message"" is not as clear as in movies like ""The Moment After"" or ""Six - The Mark Unleashed"" (both - MUST SEE movies!) but it is there.This movie has Spanish Subtitles but I was looking for English Subtitles because sometimes I have difficulty in discriminating dialog.If you purchase this DVD (and I recommend it for it's performances and it's message) be sure to watch the Featurette about how it was made because you learn a lot about David White and Kevin Downes and the planning and the problems that go into producing a movie like this and also the blessing for all involved in the endeavor.",4,"Those who are ""good"" are not ALL good and those who are ""bad"" are not ALL bad!",1301184000,"03 27, 2011",2011,1227,"['difficult', 'know', 'where', 'go', 'reviewing', 'movie', 'bit', 'cross', 'type', 'movie', 'made', 'take', 'wider', 'audience', 'Overall', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'liked', 'especially', 'David', 'White', '/', 'Kevin', 'Downes', 'creative', 'team.The', 'plot', 'was', 'stretch', 'difficult', 'follow', 'places', 'David', 'White', 'acting', 'pulled', 'off', 'well.The', 'opening', 'scene', 'was', 'intriguing', 'hooked', 'immediately', 'However', 'when', 'movie', 'caught', 'up', 'opening', 'scene', 'chronologically', 'instead', 'being', 'Oh', '-I-Get-It', 'moment', 'seemed', 'anti-climactic', 'when', 'hear', 'rest', 'dialog', 'point.The', 'message', 'not', 'as', 'clear', 'movies', 'Moment', 'Six', 'Mark', 'Unleashed', 'MUST', 'SEE', 'movies', 'there.This', 'movie', 'Spanish', 'Subtitles', 'was', 'looking', 'English', 'Subtitles', 'sometimes', 'have', 'difficulty', 'discriminating', 'dialog.If', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'recommend', 'performances', 'message', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'Featurette', 'how', 'was', 'made', 'learn', 'lot', 'David', 'White', 'Kevin', 'Downes', 'planning', 'problems', 'go', 'producing', 'movie', 'also', 'blessing', 'involved', 'endeavor']",N/A
