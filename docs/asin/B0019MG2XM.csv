My perspective on it may be different from the average viewer.  You have to respect the filmmaker who writes, produces and directs the film, among other jobs.  He performed all aspects of the production save for the music and a few minor jobs.  That is no easy task.  This is a party film, plain and simple.  So grab your beverage, sit back with the lights off and enjoy!",4,Sit back and enjoy it and stop complaining!,1309737600,"07 4, 2011",2011,493,"['bought', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'recently', 'went', 'back', 'view', 'again', 'what', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'perspective', 'may', 'be', 'different', 'average', 'viewer', 'have', 'respect', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'produces', 'film', 'other', 'jobs', 'performed', 'aspects', 'production', 'save', 'music', 'few', 'minor', 'jobs', 'easy', 'task', 'party', 'film', 'plain', 'simple', 'grab', 'beverage', 'sit', 'back', 'lights', 'enjoy']",Abe's Tomb
1164422,A299RHMH1M9PIW,B0019MG2XM,Moderate Risk,"[5, 12]","When I saw the previews for this film, I wasn't quite sure where it was going.  Of course, how can you go wrong with Merritt's ample use of eye candy vampires, right?  While this is true, I found that Abe's Tomb had a surprisingly good storyline and it held together quite well! Director Merritt had to operate on an extremely limited budget in the creation of this, his debut horror film.  The fact that it is surprisingly good speaks well of Merritt's talents and we should all look forward to his future efforts which will surely have a larger budget after the success of this award winning debut.  Horror fans should keep an eye on Merritt as I suspect he is going places given the quality of the storyline and what he was able to achieve with the limited resources he had to allocate to this fine beginning.",5,A Surprisingly Good Film,1219881600,"08 28, 2008",2008,812,"['When', 'saw', 'previews', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'course', 'how', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'Merritt', 'ample', 'use', 'eye', 'candy', 'vampires', 'right', 'true', 'found', 'Abe', 'Tomb', 'had', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'storyline', 'held', 'together', 'quite', 'well', 'Director', 'Merritt', 'had', 'operate', 'extremely', 'limited', 'budget', 'creation', 'debut', 'horror', 'film', 'fact', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'speaks', 'well', 'Merritt', 'talents', 'should', 'look', 'forward', 'future', 'efforts', 'will', 'surely', 'have', 'larger', 'budget', 'success', 'award', 'winning', 'debut', 'Horror', 'fans', 'should', 'keep', 'eye', 'Merritt', 'suspect', 'going', 'places', 'given', 'quality', 'storyline', 'what', 'was', 'able', 'achieve', 'limited', 'resources', 'had', 'allocate', 'fine', 'beginning']",Abe's Tomb

If the filmmakers intended this to be a serious vampire movie, then clearly i was viewing a different film all together.First of all, the cast must have been friends of the director, as no-one could act in the film. The look of 'suprise' when the innocents were confronted/attacked by the vampires was hilarious. In fact, i had to rewind certain scenes as i couldn't stop laughing in parts and missed some of the dialogue.When it came to the gory scenes, the blood used clearly looked like a watery jelly. You didn't even see anyone get bitten as the camera quite smartly turned away just in time, leaving the viewer to imagine what must have happened.The fight scenes are pure brilliance. It reminded me of my school playground days when i used to play 'cowboys' and 'indians' and when i was 'punched', i'd do a dodgy forward roll and get back up on my feet. The scenes in Ab's Tomb are exactly like that. Think i'm exagerating? Check it out!!!Don't get me wrong. I love low budget horror films (hollywood chainsaw hookers is a classic). And the reason i'm giving this movie 4 stars is because i found it highly entertaining for all the wrong reasons.This title sits proudly on my dvd shelf with other classics such as zombies, zombies, zombies, piranha women in the avocado jungle of death and blood sucking pharoh's in pittsburg.
