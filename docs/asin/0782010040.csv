This film was dedicated to the USMC, who aided in its production. The screenplay was written by Harry Brown, the author of ""A Walk in the Sun"", and has some of the actors from that earlier film. It begins after the Battle of Guadalcanal. The men are sent to New Zealand to rest, retrain, and get more replacements. Sgt. John M. Stryker is the squad leader. He will learn the men what isn't in the books; their lives will depend on this. Sgt. Stryker leads the men in their drills and exercises. One soldier, Conway, joined for the family tradition. Stryker drives his men hard, they need training. He also has a family problem. The men have liberty in Wellington.Stryker advises Conway against a long-term commitment. Stryker uses a novel training technique for bayonet drill [comic relief?]. Then the men get sent to their target: Tarawa. Stryker warns them of a difficult combat, no matter what the Navy guns and fliers have done. Actual scenes from combat are used. There are realistic combat scenes. Lives are spent to destroy enemy machine gun nests and take their objective. A few men are pinned down and short of ammunition. One returns for bandoliers, but tarries for a cup of coffee. The delay costs lives. ""What kept you?"" The marines must hold their position in spite of reduced strength. Tarawa was secured after four days of battle. The survivors leave the island for retraining in Hawaii. When mistakes are made, men die needlessly.Sgt. Stryker learns about civilian life in Honolulu. Civilians also have a hard life. The unit has been trained and tested in battle. They are shipped out to another Pacific island with three airfields. ""War is trading lives for real estate."" When the naval bombardment ends, the men move out to attack. They can advance only so far. A tank arrives to spread napalm. Rocket launchers are used as well. In the morning they advance on Mount Suribachi. They will raise a flag when they reach the top. Sgt. Stryker will not make it to the top. ""Things just turned out that way."" The famous flag raising is recreated, a symbol of the coming victory.This film recreates history and provides lessons that are educational. I think the screenplay of Harry Brown and his advisors made this the best WW II film if not the most successful.",5,The Best Film of the Pacific War,1210550400,"05 12, 2008",2008,2383,"['film', 'had', 'three', 'surviving', 'flag', 'raisers', 'Pfc', 'Rene', 'A.', 'Gagnon', 'Pfc', 'Ira', 'H.', 'Hayes', 'PM3C', 'John', 'H.', 'Bradley', 'film', 'was', 'dedicated', 'USMC', 'who', 'aided', 'production', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Harry', 'Brown', 'author', 'Walk', 'Sun', 'actors', 'earlier', 'film', 'Battle', 'Guadalcanal', 'men', 'are', 'sent', 'New', 'Zealand', 'rest', 'retrain', 'get', 'more', 'replacements', 'Sgt', 'John', 'M.', 'Stryker', 'squad', 'leader', 'will', 'learn', 'men', 'what', ""n't"", 'books', 'lives', 'will', 'depend', 'Sgt', 'Stryker', 'men', 'drills', 'exercises', 'One', 'soldier', 'Conway', 'joined', 'family', 'tradition', 'Stryker', 'men', 'hard', 'need', 'training', 'also', 'family', 'problem', 'men', 'have', 'liberty', 'Wellington.Stryker', 'Conway', 'long-term', 'commitment', 'Stryker', 'novel', 'training', 'technique', 'bayonet', 'drill', '[', 'comic', 'relief', ']', 'Then', 'men', 'get', 'sent', 'target', 'Tarawa', 'Stryker', 'difficult', 'combat', 'matter', 'what', 'Navy', 'guns', 'fliers', 'have', 'done', 'Actual', 'scenes', 'combat', 'are', 'used', 'are', 'realistic', 'combat', 'scenes', 'Lives', 'are', 'spent', 'destroy', 'enemy', 'machine', 'gun', 'nests', 'take', 'objective', 'few', 'men', 'are', 'pinned', 'down', 'short', 'ammunition', 'One', 'bandoliers', 'tarries', 'cup', 'coffee', 'delay', 'What', 'kept', 'marines', 'must', 'hold', 'position', 'spite', 'reduced', 'strength', 'Tarawa', 'was', 'secured', 'four', 'days', 'battle', 'survivors', 'leave', 'island', 'retraining', 'Hawaii', 'When', 'mistakes', 'are', 'made', 'men', 'die', 'needlessly.Sgt', 'Stryker', 'civilian', 'life', 'Honolulu', 'Civilians', 'also', 'have', 'hard', 'life', 'unit', 'been', 'trained', 'tested', 'battle', 'are', 'shipped', 'Pacific', 'island', 'three', 'airfields', 'War', 'trading', 'lives', 'real', 'estate', 'When', 'naval', 'bombardment', 'ends', 'men', 'move', 'attack', 'can', 'advance', 'only', 'so', 'far', 'tank', 'spread', 'napalm', 'Rocket', 'launchers', 'are', 'used', 'well', 'morning', 'advance', 'Mount', 'Suribachi', 'will', 'raise', 'flag', 'when', 'reach', 'top', 'Sgt', 'Stryker', 'will', 'not', 'make', 'top', 'Things', 'just', 'turned', 'out', 'way', 'famous', 'flag', 'raising', 'recreated', 'symbol', 'coming', 'victory.This', 'film', 'history', 'lessons', 'are', 'educational', 'think', 'screenplay', 'Harry', 'Brown', 'advisors', 'made', 'best', 'WW', 'II', 'film', 'not', 'most', 'successful']",Sands of Iwo Jima

Its obvious thatthis guy represents what Wayne fears his son will be turnedinto by his wife: an anti-american/anti-military peacenikliberal weakling.Wayne is the pure image of the american fighting leader.  He isa machine that crushes everyone in his path.  He knocks oneold troublemaker soldier around as an example and that bringsthe men into line.

And having accomplished his task, Striker iskilled during the battle.His death teaches us as Americans a final and most importantlesson.  None of the men are important in their lives or whatthey do.  Leaders are not important either.  Whats important isthat the corps as a big machine keeps going.  Striker buildsthe new leaders in battle and then the torch is passed to themto go on and do the same thing.War builds character and burns away the phony idealogy ofliberalism and peace.

41536,A2DYGO40HTQBMQ,0782010040,Avid,"[11, 15]","I always find it irritating to read analyses of military movies by obvious civilians who know nothing about the military, combat and specifically about the Marine Corps.This is one of the best movies John Wayne made and was the one, at least, for which he should have won an Oscar.The Stryker character, played by Wayne, was not a ""martinet"". He plays a Marine sergeant, a combat veteran, the way a Marine sergeant is supposed to be. Tough, but fair. He pushes his people, boots (recruits), because he wants to help them survive when they hit the beach. If they don't survive they are no good to him and no good to the mission. Wayne does an excellent job of portraying that.The surviving flag raisers who were in the movie were Marines Gagnon and Hayes, and Navy Corpsman Bradley (whose son wrote Flags of Our Fathers), not, as one previewer noted, ""three Marines"". Navy Corpsmen are proud to be Navy Corpsmen and are respected as such by the Marines with whom they serve.Also, the characters were not ""soldiers"" and it is really irritating when that term is used to describe Marines. The men this story is about were Marines and the actors play Marines, a title that is EARNED.In short, even though actual combat footage is spliced into the movie's action, given the time it was made, it is well done. There are some romantic lulls, but given the period the movie was made, 40s and 50s, this was fairly typical. Overali, this is a great movie, even if you are a civilian. It will give fans of the Duke something memorable to watch. It may also give critics of John Wayne a new view of the man as a solid actor.",5,"Semper Fi, Mac!",1161043200,"10 17, 2006",2006,1612,"['always', 'find', 'irritating', 'read', 'analyses', 'military', 'movies', 'obvious', 'civilians', 'who', 'know', 'nothing', 'military', 'combat', 'specifically', 'Marine', 'Corps.This', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'John', 'Wayne', 'made', 'was', 'one', 'least', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar.The', 'Stryker', 'character', 'played', 'Wayne', 'was', 'not', 'martinet', 'Marine', 'sergeant', 'combat', 'veteran', 'way', 'Marine', 'sergeant', 'supposed', 'be', 'Tough', 'fair', 'people', 'boots', 'recruits', 'help', 'survive', 'when', 'hit', 'beach', 'do', ""n't"", 'survive', 'are', 'good', 'good', 'mission', 'Wayne', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'that.The', 'surviving', 'flag', 'raisers', 'who', 'were', 'movie', 'were', 'Marines', 'Gagnon', 'Hayes', 'Navy', 'Corpsman', 'Bradley', 'son', 'wrote', 'Flags', 'Fathers', 'not', 'one', 'previewer', 'noted', 'three', 'Marines', 'Navy', 'Corpsmen', 'are', 'proud', 'be', 'Navy', 'Corpsmen', 'are', 'respected', 'such', 'Marines', 'whom', 'serve.Also', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'soldiers', 'really', 'irritating', 'when', 'term', 'used', 'describe', 'Marines', 'men', 'story', 'were', 'Marines', 'actors', 'play', 'Marines', 'title', 'EARNED.In', 'short', 'even', 'actual', 'combat', 'footage', 'spliced', 'movie', 'action', 'given', 'time', 'was', 'made', 'well', 'done', 'are', 'romantic', 'lulls', 'given', 'period', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '40s', '50s', 'was', 'fairly', 'typical', 'Overali', 'great', 'movie', 'even', 'are', 'civilian', 'will', 'give', 'fans', 'Duke', 'something', 'memorable', 'watch', 'may', 'also', 'give', 'critics', 'John', 'Wayne', 'new', 'view', 'man', 'solid', 'actor']",Sands of Iwo Jima
41537,AHCVWPLA1O4X8,0782010040,bixodoido,"[3, 4]","John Wayne stars as Sargeant John M. Stryker in this very well-done movie about what is perhaps the most famous battle of the Pacific campaign--Iwo Jima.  The special effects are good for the time (1950), and the scenery adds greatly to the overall effect of the film.  Wayne does an excellent job as Stryker, the tough-as-nails marine who is hard on his men but soft at heart.The most compelling thing about this film is Wayne's character.  He is no great war-hero--in fact, he does very little on the battlefield of any great consequence.  Instead, he does his duty, unglamorous though it may be.  He is human, and this is what sets him apart from many war-movie heroes today.  The movie lacks any intense combat or epic battles, but its strength lies in the character of Stryker and in his relationship with his men.The reason I don't give this five stars is because it's scope pales in comparison with many other war movies.  Part of this is due to technology, but much is also due to more action-intense films which (I think) help us understand better the battles and conflicts which the movies portray.  Such movies as Gettysburg, We Were Soldiers, and even old films like All Quiet on the Western Front do a much better job than this film of showing the various positions of the battle, and of the obstacles the soldiers faced.  The marines in this film have a relatively easy time getting to the top of Iwo Jima, but I would have liked to have had a little more information about the battle.  Were it not for this, I would give the movie five stars without hesitation.",4,"A good movie about WWII, and a great performance by the Duke",1051228800,"04 25, 2003",2003,1576,"['John', 'Wayne', 'Sargeant', 'John', 'M.', 'Stryker', 'very', 'well-done', 'movie', 'what', 'perhaps', 'most', 'famous', 'battle', 'Pacific', 'campaign', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'time', '1950', 'scenery', 'greatly', 'overall', 'effect', 'film', 'Wayne', 'excellent', 'job', 'Stryker', 'tough-as-nails', 'marine', 'who', 'hard', 'men', 'soft', 'heart.The', 'most', 'compelling', 'thing', 'film', 'Wayne', 'character', 'great', 'war-hero', 'fact', 'very', 'little', 'battlefield', 'great', 'consequence', 'Instead', 'duty', 'unglamorous', 'may', 'be', 'human', 'what', 'apart', 'many', 'war-movie', 'heroes', 'today', 'movie', 'intense', 'combat', 'epic', 'battles', 'strength', 'character', 'Stryker', 'relationship', 'men.The', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'scope', 'pales', 'comparison', 'many', 'other', 'war', 'movies', 'Part', 'due', 'technology', 'much', 'also', 'due', 'more', 'action-intense', 'films', 'think', 'help', 'understand', 'better', 'battles', 'conflicts', 'movies', 'portray', 'Such', 'movies', 'Gettysburg', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'even', 'old', 'films', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', 'do', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'film', 'showing', 'various', 'positions', 'battle', 'obstacles', 'soldiers', 'faced', 'marines', 'film', 'have', 'relatively', 'easy', 'time', 'getting', 'top', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'had', 'little', 'more', 'information', 'battle', 'Were', 'not', 'would', 'give', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'hesitation']",Sands of Iwo Jima
41538,A1PYZWEC4SCUB8,0782010040,Book N Film Fan,"[1, 1]","''The Sands of Iwo Jima'' covers far more than the Marine invasion of Iwo Jima in World War II.  The film follows the seemingly real Sergeant John Stryker (John Wayne) and the men he was commanded over a period of a year or so in the South Pacific. While the film's script is only loosely based on actual events, it's not hard to believe the men in the film and events that they experienced could very well have happened in real-life.The film opens with the U.S. Marines regrouping in New Zealand after the fight for Guadalcanal had ended. Sergeant Stryker is assigned to command a platoon of Marines who are anxious to see some action. Stryker's hard-bitten, by-the-book command style (''Saddle-up! Saddle-up!'') soon rankles many of the men, especially Private Thomas (Forrest Tucker) who had fought alongside him before, and Private Conway (John Agar), whose recently killed-in-action father was a carbon-copy of the hard-nosed Stryker.Stryker's attempt to whip the men into a fighting force has mixed results. Some are incompetent, while Conway and Thomas try to buck his authority. Stryker tries to win-over Conway by expressing his admiration for Conway's father. But Conway, who is somewhat arrogant, despised his father and now takes his hatred out to Stryker. On top of that, Stryker is battling his own personal demons which he tries to drown in alcohol when off duty.Over the course of the film the Marines see action in Tarawa and later Iwo Jima. The film effectively captures the camaraderie amongst the men and also their fears, bravery, and successes. Although the film is not gory, it does show the death and destruction of warfare. The film also shows how some men made terrible mistakes that cost the lives of others and how Stryker tried to show leadership under extremely stressful conditions even as some of his men battled him every step of the way.''The Sands of Iwo Jima'' is a must-have-film for any World War II buff. Director Allan Dwan did an excellent job of capturing the toughness of the Marines along with their softer moments and devotion to each other. There are some corny scenes in the film and it's not as realistic as war films made since the 1990s, but I rate the movie as a strong 4 stars and recommend it to anyone interested in learning about World War II, the U.S. Marines, or John Wayne in one of his finest roles ever.",4,An admirable tribute to the U.S. Marines,1223164800,"10 5, 2008",2008,2363,"['Sands', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'far', 'more', 'Marine', 'invasion', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'film', 'seemingly', 'real', 'Sergeant', 'John', 'Stryker', 'John', 'Wayne', 'men', 'was', 'commanded', 'over', 'period', 'year', 'so', 'South', 'Pacific', 'film', 'script', 'only', 'loosely', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'not', 'hard', 'believe', 'men', 'film', 'events', 'experienced', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'happened', 'real-life.The', 'film', 'U.S.', 'Marines', 'regrouping', 'New', 'Zealand', 'fight', 'Guadalcanal', 'had', 'ended', 'Sergeant', 'Stryker', 'assigned', 'command', 'platoon', 'Marines', 'who', 'are', 'anxious', 'see', 'action', 'Stryker', 'hard-bitten', 'by-the-book', 'command', 'style', 'Saddle-up', 'Saddle-up', 'soon', 'many', 'men', 'especially', 'Private', 'Thomas', 'Forrest', 'Tucker', 'who', 'had', 'fought', 'alongside', 'Private', 'Conway', 'John', 'Agar', 'recently', 'killed-in-action', 'father', 'was', 'carbon-copy', 'hard-nosed', 'Stryker.Stryker', 'attempt', 'whip', 'men', 'fighting', 'force', 'mixed', 'results', 'are', 'incompetent', 'Conway', 'Thomas', 'try', 'buck', 'authority', 'Stryker', 'win-over', 'Conway', 'expressing', 'admiration', 'Conway', 'father', 'Conway', 'who', 'somewhat', 'arrogant', 'despised', 'father', 'now', 'hatred', 'out', 'Stryker', 'top', 'Stryker', 'battling', 'own', 'personal', 'demons', 'drown', 'alcohol', 'when', 'off', 'duty.Over', 'course', 'film', 'Marines', 'see', 'action', 'Tarawa', 'later', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'film', 'effectively', 'camaraderie', 'men', 'also', 'fears', 'bravery', 'successes', 'film', 'not', 'gory', 'show', 'death', 'destruction', 'warfare', 'film', 'also', 'how', 'men', 'made', 'terrible', 'mistakes', 'cost', 'lives', 'others', 'how', 'Stryker', 'tried', 'show', 'leadership', 'extremely', 'stressful', 'conditions', 'even', 'men', 'battled', 'step', 'way', ""''The"", 'Sands', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'must-have-film', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'buff', 'Director', 'Allan', 'Dwan', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'capturing', 'toughness', 'Marines', 'softer', 'moments', 'devotion', 'other', 'are', 'corny', 'scenes', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'realistic', 'war', 'films', 'made', '1990s', 'rate', 'movie', 'strong', '4', 'stars', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'interested', 'learning', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'U.S.', 'Marines', 'John', 'Wayne', 'one', 'finest', 'roles', 'ever']",Sands of Iwo Jima

41554,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,0782010040,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[7, 8]","Iwo Jima was one of the most bloody battles of the Pacific war.  Thousands of Japanese and American soldiers lost their lives fighting over this island which was barely five miles long and two miles wide.  Republic Pictures produced this timeless movie about that battle.  John Wayne gives a stirring performance as Sergeant John Stryker, a tough-as-nails yet compassionate marine who is trying to mold his squad of raw recruits into a fighting machine.  John Agar stars as PFC Peter Conway, a college-educated marine who truly dislikes Stryker and his tactics.  However, over the course of the film, Conway develops a genuine respect and friendship for Stryker.  Forrest Tucker does a marvelous job as PFC Al Thomas, one of the few combat veterans in the squad.The movie begins with the marines training in Hawaii.  After completing their training, the squad is sent as part of the invasion force of the island of Tarawa.  I found some mistakes made by the producers dealing with this part of the movie.  In the film, the landing craft are seen driving directly up to the beach and discharging their men.  This is inaccurate.  In reality, the marines who actually invaded Tarawa were forced to deploy from their landing craft as far as one half mile from the beach due to a low tide which didn't allow the amphibious craft to get close to the beach.After the Tarawa invasion, the squad goes back for more training and replacements.  Finally, it was on to Iwo Jima.  The actual battle scenes on Iwo Jima only last about 15 to 20 minutes, but the fighting was very realistic, especially the flag raising on Mt. Surabachi.  The three surviving flag raisers, Rene Gagnon, Ira Hayes, and John Bradley, actually took part in the flag raising in the movie.I enjoyed this movie very much.  The colorized version was especially good, although some of the colors looked strange.  John Wayne, John Agar, Forrest Tucker, and the entire cast helped bring the war in the Pacific and especially Iwo Jima to life.  This rates as one of John Wayne's best performances.

Sands Of Iwo Jima was the first film to give full credit to the Marines. By the time 1949 had come around (when this film was released) every branch had several films made about there own. Only the Marines had a few before, and they were far and few between each other. The film starts out as Cpl.Dunne (Arthur Franz) who is our narrator, informs us about his rifle squad. His squad saw action on Guadalcanal and from there on were battle harden Marines. Only himself Pfc. Bass (James Brown) and tough as nails Sgt. Stryker (John Wayne) survived to fight another day. When the squad is sent to New Zealand to recieve even more training. The new replacements just from the states arrive. Cpl. Thomas (Forrest Tucker), who already knows Stryker and hates him. The Flynn brothers from the city of Brotherly Love, who fight all the time (Richard Jaeckel and William Murphy.) and Pfc. Conway (John Agar) who's father fought on the &quot;Canal&quot; with Sgt. Stryker, he is only there because of &quot;tradition.&quot; But the person that helps shape the film as a supporting actor is Pfc. Benny Regazzi (Wally Cassell) who gives a better than note worthy performance. Regazzi always carries a flag tucked into his shirt to raise over the island once it has been secured, but is always too late. The new formed squad heads to Tarawa, this is where the new state side men get there taste of combat. They go up against Japanese Marines, thats the best they got. From the begining Stryker and  Conway go at it all the time. Conway who hated his father for more than one reason, finds another reason to hate Stryker because of his admiration for Conways late father. Conway falls in love with a girl Allison Bromley (Adele Mara) and finds a reason to come back from the war. But in the end he can't help but hear a voice in the back of his mind saying he might not return to her. But he along with his men start a slow relationship of respect torward Stryker. Great editing is used to mix real combat footage with the actors in the film. In some places it is so real, one has to look closely to tell them apart. Even then you can't at times. Wayne's performance earned him along overdue Oscar nomination for Best Actor. Although he did not win. What he gave us was a believable, flawed, loving and troubled man at the same time. This war movie has stayed at the top of many list, and it is still loved to this day. Get the original black and white version. The color one just doesn't do it!

The troops include everything you'd expect in a World War  II movie; the smart-mouthed, know-it-all rich kid; a street-wise hispanic  kid from a tough neighborhood; a pleasure-loving goof off and just about  every other stereotype of the American fighting man you can dream up.  Of  course, the Duke is there to guide them with just the right combination of  verbal wisdom and right-crosses.  There's even a healthy serving of  sentimentality to round out the tour of cliches.Nonetheless, the Sands  of Iwo Jima rises above its predictability to be a solidly entertaining  action film and a rousing tribute to the tenacity, sense of self-sacrifice  and fighting spirit of the Marine Corps.  Despite its rampant and obvious  emotionalism, you can't help but feel a lump in your throat as The Shores  of Tripoli is played to segue from the final scenes into the closing  credits.Like most Wayne pictures, the emphasis here is on the action,  and the movie provides plenty of it, mixing actual combat footage, stock  film and original cinematography into a tightly knit, effective  product.This may not be the best picture John Wayne ever made, but it's  way up the list.

41558,A3BO21YK08SSV8,0782010040,John M Walker,"[6, 7]","I am neither a fan nor a detractor of John Wayne, but it's true many of his movies I have trouble finishing -- they just don't capture my interest very well. This movie is an exception. I find myself watching this one repeatedly.I understand the Marine Corps had some misgivings about their story being told by a B-movie studio (Republic), but I think this film brings that studio great credit. Wayne was nominated for Best Actor for this film, and in restrospect, I think he should have won (Jose Ferrer won that year).This movie has quite satisfactory subplots, more than passable acting, some nice crisp, intelligent dialog in places, and some characterizations that can evoke the interest and sympathy of the audience. The scene where Stryker (Wayne) visits the apartment of a woman he meets in a bar is particularly edifying. This is a surprisingly good movie, and it's wearing well over the years.I hate to nitpick, but there is an error or two on these pages concerning the historical accuracy of this film -- which also is surprisingly good; it's clear the film's makers were as careful as they could be. The landing craft at Tarawa in the film are LVTs (Landing Vehicle, Tracked), and this is correct for the first wave. The planners of the assault knew these would be important to surmount the reef, but their numbers were limited, so ensuing waves used LCVPs which could not cross the reef, and these are the troops who were slaughtered while wading in. Also, the movie correctly portrays the Marines in training for this assault as being stationed in New Zealand.Furthermore, the actual ascent of Suribachi was indeed relatively easy after five or so tortuous days of preparation -- but most of the carnage lay ahead; the battle was just getting warmed up. About 15% of USMC combat fatalities from 1776 through the Gulf War (1991) occured on Iwo Jima.This movie succeeds very nicely to tell an important war story without unnecessary violence, and some touching love relationships without lewdness.

41561,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0782010040,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[25, 27]","""Sands of Iwo Jima"" was the first movie I ever saw in which John Wayne played a character who actually died, which was certainly one of the more shocking deaths I can remember ever seeing in a film.  Wayne plays Sgt. John Marion Stryker and since Wayne's real name was Marion Michael Morrison there seems to be an additional level of identification between actor and character here, while the power of the name ""Stryker"" is obvious.  Stryker seems a bully to the green recruits he is training to be U.S. Marines in 1943.  When the men of the rifle squad learn that Stryker's wife had taken their son and left him they think they know the reason why the man who was once the epitome of the tough Marine has become such a martinet.Of course when Stryker and his men hit the beach at Tarawa and are fighting for their lives against the Japanese troops defending the island, they understand that his hard lessons are the difference being life and death in combat.  Then comes the last hard nut to crack of the islands occupied by the Japanese, the volcanic island of Iwo Jima.  As the officer briefing the troops says, ""nobody knows exactly what they've got on this island, but they've had forty years to put it there.""  Director Allan Dwan takes advantage of actual combat footage from the documentaries ""With the Marines at Tarawa"" and ""To the Shores of Iwo Jima"" to provide an added dimension of realism to the battle sequences.  The reenactment of the flag raising on Iwo Jima involved Rene Gagnon, Ira Hayes, and John Bradley, the only three Marines in the celebrated photograph who survived the battle.Since this is a Hollywood war movie Stryker's rifle squad consists of not just new recruits but a few veterans, including Al Thomas (Forrest Tucker), an old enemy who is perfectly willing to bad mouth the sergeant at every opportunity, even after he is taken out behind the tents by Stryker to be reminded who is running the outfit.  The recruit who absorbs all of this venom the most is young Peter Conway (John Agar), whose father was Stryker's Commanding Officer at Guadalcanal.  The old man felt his son was too soft to be a Marine (he reads books and went to college) and the kid resents the particular interest Stryker is taking in his training.  Even when Stryker saves Conway's life when the kid is too busy reading a love letter to notice a live grenade gets loose during a training exercise, Conway refuses to show gratitude.  So in addition to their relationship and sergeant and private Stryker and Conway are playing out their own familial relationship problems with each other as well.It is in battle that Stryker is at his best, blowing up a Japanese bunker to save trapped Marines, and once he proves himself to be a warrior god his squad, now tested in battle, finally becomes a true band of brothers.  But ""The Sands of Iwo Jima"" has the elements of a Greek tragedy and at the moment of his apotheosis the hero must fall.  Adding insult to injury the blow comes from behind and the shot of a bullet hole beneath Stryker's stenciled name on the back of his fatigues is even more powerful than the reenactment of the raising of the second American flag on Mt. Surabachi.This is not the best war movie of 1949; that honor goes to William Wellman's ""Battleground,"" which remains one of the very best of the best in the World War II genre.  Wayne was nominated for Best Actor, the only other time he was up for an Oscar besides ""True Grit,"" although he arguably gave a better performance that same year in his previous film ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.""  Despite the pair of strong performances by the Duke the Academy Award went to Broderick Crawford for ""All the King's Men,"" but ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" remains Wayne's best WWII movie and one of the few that stands up with his classic westerns.""",5,"John Wayne teaches young Marines how to ""Saddle up!""",1097366400,"10 10, 2004",2004,3810,"['Sands', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'ever', 'saw', 'John', 'Wayne', 'played', 'character', 'who', 'actually', 'died', 'was', 'certainly', 'one', 'more', 'shocking', 'deaths', 'can', 'remember', 'ever', 'seeing', 'film', 'Wayne', 'Sgt', 'John', 'Marion', 'Stryker', 'Wayne', 'real', 'name', 'was', 'Marion', 'Michael', 'Morrison', 'there', 'be', 'additional', 'level', 'identification', 'actor', 'character', 'here', 'power', 'name', 'Stryker', 'obvious', 'Stryker', 'bully', 'green', 'recruits', 'training', 'be', 'U.S.', 'Marines', '1943', 'When', 'men', 'rifle', 'squad', 'learn', 'Stryker', 'wife', 'had', 'taken', 'son', 'left', 'think', 'know', 'reason', 'why', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'epitome', 'tough', 'Marine', 'become', 'martinet.Of', 'course', 'when', 'Stryker', 'men', 'hit', 'beach', 'Tarawa', 'are', 'fighting', 'lives', 'Japanese', 'troops', 'defending', 'island', 'understand', 'hard', 'lessons', 'are', 'difference', 'being', 'life', 'death', 'combat', 'Then', 'last', 'hard', 'nut', 'crack', 'islands', 'occupied', 'Japanese', 'volcanic', 'island', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'officer', 'briefing', 'troops', 'nobody', 'exactly', 'what', ""'ve"", 'got', 'island', ""'ve"", 'had', 'forty', 'years', 'put', 'there', 'Director', 'Allan', 'Dwan', 'advantage', 'actual', 'combat', 'footage', 'documentaries', 'Marines', 'Tarawa', 'Shores', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'provide', 'added', 'dimension', 'realism', 'battle', 'sequences', 'reenactment', 'flag', 'raising', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'involved', 'Rene', 'Gagnon', 'Ira', 'Hayes', 'John', 'Bradley', 'only', 'three', 'Marines', 'celebrated', 'photograph', 'who', 'survived', 'battle.Since', 'Hollywood', 'war', 'movie', 'Stryker', 'rifle', 'squad', 'not', 'just', 'new', 'recruits', 'few', 'veterans', 'including', 'Al', 'Thomas', 'Forrest', 'Tucker', 'old', 'enemy', 'who', 'perfectly', 'willing', 'bad', 'sergeant', 'opportunity', 'even', 'taken', 'out', 'tents', 'Stryker', 'be', 'reminded', 'who', 'running', 'outfit', 'recruit', 'who', 'absorbs', 'most', 'young', 'Peter', 'Conway', 'John', 'Agar', 'father', 'was', 'Stryker', 'Commanding', 'Officer', 'Guadalcanal', 'old', 'man', 'felt', 'son', 'was', 'too', 'soft', 'be', 'Marine', 'books', 'went', 'college', 'kid', 'particular', 'interest', 'Stryker', 'taking', 'training', 'Even', 'when', 'Stryker', 'Conway', 'life', 'when', 'kid', 'too', 'busy', 'reading', 'love', 'letter', 'notice', 'live', 'grenade', 'loose', 'training', 'exercise', 'Conway', 'show', 'gratitude', 'So', 'addition', 'relationship', 'sergeant', 'private', 'Stryker', 'Conway', 'are', 'playing', 'out', 'own', 'familial', 'relationship', 'problems', 'other', 'well.It', 'battle', 'Stryker', 'best', 'blowing', 'up', 'Japanese', 'bunker', 'save', 'trapped', 'Marines', 'once', 'be', 'warrior', 'god', 'squad', 'now', 'tested', 'battle', 'finally', 'true', 'band', 'brothers', 'Sands', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'elements', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'moment', 'apotheosis', 'hero', 'must', 'fall', 'Adding', 'insult', 'injury', 'blow', 'shot', 'bullet', 'hole', 'beneath', 'Stryker', 'stenciled', 'name', 'back', 'fatigues', 'even', 'more', 'powerful', 'reenactment', 'raising', 'second', 'American', 'flag', 'Mt', 'Surabachi.This', 'not', 'best', 'war', 'movie', '1949', 'honor', 'William', 'Wellman', 'Battleground', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'best', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'genre', 'Wayne', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actor', 'only', 'other', 'time', 'was', 'up', 'Oscar', 'True', 'Grit', 'arguably', 'gave', 'better', 'performance', 'same', 'year', 'previous', 'film', 'Wore', 'Yellow', 'Ribbon', 'pair', 'strong', 'performances', 'Duke', 'Academy', 'Award', 'went', 'Broderick', 'Crawford', 'King', 'Men', 'Sands', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'Wayne', 'best', 'WWII', 'movie', 'one', 'few', 'up', 'classic', 'westerns']",Sands of Iwo Jima

41563,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,0782010040,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","This old, black and white film, made in 1949 in a very jingoistic style proper to the war time Hollywood productions, is still (in my modest opinion) the best film on battle of Iwo Jima ever made - and yes, even if I am a huge fan of Clint Eastwood, I still consider this movie as better than his double film ""Flags of our fathers""/ ""Letters from Iwo Jima"". This film also is the only one until now to show the hellish battle of Tarawa in 1943.John Wayne plays here one of his pretty stereotypic characters - an extremely tough Marine Sergeant, John Stryker, a professional soldier who was already a veteran when war started and who earned quite a reputation on the battlefield at Guadalcanal (this battle is not shown in the film). The film begins, when Stryker's section receives replacements and starts training preparing for another operation - it will be the short but incredibly bloody and intense battle of Tarawa. Stryker is almost unanimously hated by his soldiers, because he makes their life a hell... But later, those who survived the battle of Tarawa, change radically their perception of this tyranic, hard drinking, brutish sergeant, recognizing that he prepared them the best he could for the REAL hell... After a period of recuperation and more training Marines are headed towards their toughest battle ever - Iwo Jima...Although maybe a little bit aged in the dialogs, this film is surprisingly realistic in the battle scenes. Some real veterans of Tarawa and Iwo Jima played themselves in this film and that includes three surviving Marines out of the six who put the American flag on the top of Mount Suribachi. Just to be clear, John Wayne's character is nowhere near this great scene...This is also I believe one of the very few old war movies, which show so clearly how hard those times could be on civilians, especially those more vulnerable. One of the best parts of the film is that in which Wayne's character answers to the advances of a girl in a bar. But once he arrives at her little appartment, he realises that she is a single mom and even if she has a daytime job, she still doesn't earn enough to support herself and her baby - and therefore she more or less prostitutes herself when she can not make the ends meet at the end on the month... This is a pretty strong scene for 1949.Stryker's character, once we get to know him better, becomes quite interesting. His long term conflict with one of his soldiers, a particularly hard-case of bad mouth and mean attitude, is well described. And the ending of the film is pretty strong and rather atypical for John Wayne's movies.And finally, this is also the first film in which we can hear the expression ""load and lock"". Used by Wayne's character as an order to get ready, this expression since then entered the English language for good.So bottom line, this is a very fine war film, which aged much less than one could expect and still packs some considerable punch. It is a pity, that although nominated for the Oscar, John Wayne didn't get it for this role (he had to wait 20 years to finally get this reward). Recommended to all John Wayne's fans and all the amateurs of war movies.

Of the six marines who raised the flag on Mount Suribachi, only three survived, all of which led quiet lives afterwards, never boasting about their achievements; many of their comrades died there.  This movie was made right after the war just when the U.S. government was considering nixing the marines.  John Wayne was one of many who came to the rescue, and in the movie, he does so as the brave Sargeant Stryker.  The marines were instrumental in taking the island, as the VHS version documents after the end of the actual film.  This movie was one of my dad's favorite WWII films; my dad was only 16 at the time the war ended, yet had a friend who survived this battle, yet with the loss of one of his legs.  Almost 7000 Americans died, many tens of thousands were wounded.  The Japanese population on this small island was very nearly annihilated.  John Wayne's first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor came from his role in this film.Though many of the actors in this film were well known in their day, the only one I had heard of was John Wayne, although I'm sure my dad would've known them all.  The movie is very dated, over 50 years old.  I didn't get really interested in the story until half way through in that it mainly depicts barracks life for the marines until their deployment.  The actual battle takes up only a fraction of the movie's time, the majority of it more concerned with the personalities and conflicts within the corp pre-engagement.  I had hoped the movie would contain more historical details than it did since I knew precious little about it; however, probably in 1949, most Americans knew all about it from the news, newspapers and from friends and relatives who knew of people who had fought there.  (The quote from Nimitz was not in the movie, nor the historical facts).  Still, the movie's a classic, and I can see why my dad loved it.

Rosenthal won the Pulitzer Prize in 1945 for the photograph, five Marines and one Naval Corpsman planting a large American flag on the hard summit of Mount Suribachi.  The photograph has inspired memorials, books and movies.Movies like 1949's SANDS OF IWO JIMA, whose reason for being is to faithfully recreate the flag-raising incident and, coincidentally, nudge John Wayne down the path that took him from movie star to American icon.Wayne plays Marine Sergeant John Stryker, a tough-as-nails type who has to whip his squad into shape during a rest, refit and replacement stint between battle action in the Pacific theater.  Among his charges are John Agar, Forrest Tucker, Wally Cassell, and Richard Jaeckel.  Agar plays resentful, Tucker irresponsible, Cassell and Jaeckel provide comic relief that isn't.Wayne, as usual, plays the tough guy role with great verve, and has the acting chops to handle the introspective moments with delicacy.  The real scenes of beach battle are well integrated in the studio stuff to good, if not great, effect.  It's interesting to see real flame throwing tanks attack real pillboxes, but for the most part it's a chaotic melange of exploding sand and expiring actors.  As usual, the ebb and flow of real battle is ignored.What isn't ignored, unfortunately, is the story of rancorous PFC Pete Conway, the Agar character, who plays Wayne's main antagonist.  Conway woos a USO women, played by Allison Bromley, and the movie sags considerably in the handful of courtship scenes Agar is involved in.  The making of feature (hosted by Leonard Maltin) tells us that Wayne wanted Agar in the movie, which goes to show you that great actors don't necessarily make great casting directors.I'm usually a reliable sucker for tear inducing final scenes, but I didn't lump up at the end of SANDS OF IWO JIMA where and when I was supposed to.

41579,ALN0TTRTLHA4E,0782010040,"Tom Munro ""tomfrombrunswick""","[4, 8]",The battle of Iwo Jima was actually the most successful defensive action the Japanese fought in the Pacific. Their strategy had been to set up a defensive perimeter and to then inflict heavy casualties on the attacking American and Imperial forces. This way they hoped to offset the material and technical superiority of the allies by the fanatical courage of their troops. The problems faced by the Japanese was that often local commanders would lose patience and order their men to attack. These attacks were easily repelled by the superior allied fire power.Iwo Jima was a battle in which the Japanese dug in away from the beaches and stubbornly fought  a defensive battle making the Americans pay for every inch of territory that they moved over. At the end of the battle the Japanese had caused the greatest number of casualties for their own losses in any of the later Pacific Battles.It is thus no surprise that a film was made about this action. In addition the battle gave rise to one of the more effective symbols of any action in the Pacific. The raising on top of the Mount Suribachi of an American flag by seven members of the US armed forces.The film itself is very much a film that has been made close to the Pacific war. The portrayal of the Japanese is not good and the aim of the film is to celebrate the courage of the US marines who took the island. (And of course courage they had in abundance)The way the film is designed is to initially concentrate on the training of the recruits with the suggestion of its importance in steeling them for battle. It has always surprised me how much Americans have been addicted to methods of troop training which were designed to coordinate the movement of musketeers in the time of Frederick the Great. The characters are pretty much stereotypes rather than real people but to concentrate on that would be churlish.Never the less the film is a classic of its type. Perhaps not so much propaganda but a celebration of the actions of brave men who gave to their country what was asked of them.,4,Sort of high quality propoganda,1014854400,"02 28, 2002",2002,2050,"['battle', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'was', 'actually', 'most', 'successful', 'defensive', 'action', 'Japanese', 'fought', 'Pacific', 'strategy', 'had', 'been', 'set', 'up', 'defensive', 'perimeter', 'then', 'inflict', 'heavy', 'casualties', 'attacking', 'American', 'Imperial', 'forces', 'way', 'hoped', 'offset', 'material', 'technical', 'superiority', 'allies', 'fanatical', 'courage', 'troops', 'problems', 'faced', 'Japanese', 'was', 'often', 'local', 'commanders', 'would', 'lose', 'patience', 'order', 'men', 'attack', 'attacks', 'were', 'easily', 'repelled', 'superior', 'allied', 'fire', 'power.Iwo', 'Jima', 'was', 'battle', 'Japanese', 'dug', 'away', 'beaches', 'stubbornly', 'fought', 'defensive', 'battle', 'making', 'Americans', 'pay', 'inch', 'territory', 'moved', 'over', 'end', 'battle', 'Japanese', 'had', 'caused', 'greatest', 'number', 'casualties', 'own', 'losses', 'later', 'Pacific', 'Battles.It', 'thus', 'surprise', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'action', 'addition', 'battle', 'gave', 'rise', 'one', 'more', 'effective', 'symbols', 'action', 'Pacific', 'raising', 'top', 'Mount', 'Suribachi', 'American', 'flag', 'seven', 'members', 'US', 'armed', 'forces.The', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'film', 'been', 'made', 'close', 'Pacific', 'war', 'portrayal', 'Japanese', 'not', 'good', 'aim', 'film', 'celebrate', 'courage', 'US', 'marines', 'who', 'took', 'island', 'course', 'courage', 'had', 'abundance', 'way', 'film', 'designed', 'initially', 'concentrate', 'training', 'recruits', 'suggestion', 'importance', 'steeling', 'battle', 'always', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'Americans', 'have', 'been', 'addicted', 'methods', 'troop', 'training', 'were', 'designed', 'coordinate', 'movement', 'musketeers', 'time', 'Frederick', 'Great', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'stereotypes', 'rather', 'real', 'people', 'concentrate', 'would', 'be', 'churlish.Never', 'less', 'film', 'classic', 'type', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'propaganda', 'celebration', 'actions', 'brave', 'men', 'who', 'gave', 'country', 'what', 'was', 'asked']",Sands of Iwo Jima

Its 'his way or sickbay'. Sent to fight in the battle of Tarawa, all his charges soon learn how deadly serious combat is. Of note in the Tarawa sequence are the cameos by Gen. David Shoup and Major 'Jim' Crowe, veterans of and leaders at the battle for Tarawa.  In a scene were Stryker's given the command to stay put so as not to give away the thinness of their understrength line to the enemy, he shows how far he will go to carry out orders, no matter how terrible the circumstances, or the personal pain or cost. In the Iwo Jima sequence (complete with cameos by three surviving flag raisers on Surabachi), he leads from the front, and though not as graphic as some would want in this era of 'Saving Private Ryan' realism, the human cost and sacrifice is always portrayed. The negative reviewers must put into perspective the time this film was released (1949). For a movie of its day, it was full of about as much realism as was allowed. As a Marine of 24 years of active service, it does say something when, to this day, Marines want to have all the positive virtues of a Sgt Stryker. It is an enduring legacy left to us by the toughest Marines of the past and embodied in this truly iconic film.",5,"""And when you stand up, you're gonna be Marines!""",1269820800,"03 29, 2010",2010,1986,"['absolutely', 'great', 'film', 'set', 'backdrop', 'WWII', 'Pacific', 'new', ""'boots"", 'recruits', 'being', 'assimilated', 'rifle', 'squad', 'led', 'one', 'toughest', 'Marines', ""'d"", 'ever', 'want', 'meet', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Sgt', 'John', 'M.', 'Stryker', 'failings', 'estranged', 'wife', 'alcohol', 'problem', 'deadly', 'serious', 'when', 'getting', 'ready', 'combat', 'John', 'Agar', 'one', 'Sgt', 'Stryker', 'recruits', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'reluctantly', 'Corps', 'not', 'sense', 'duty', 'family', 'ties', 'Corps', 'belligerent', 'Stryker', 'entreaties', 'get', 'come', 'training', 'importance', 'what', 'stake', 'Stryker', 'will', 'get', 'squad', ""'squared"", 'away', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'recruits', 'hate', ""'his"", 'way', 'sickbay', 'Sent', 'fight', 'battle', 'Tarawa', 'charges', 'soon', 'learn', 'how', 'deadly', 'serious', 'combat', 'note', 'Tarawa', 'sequence', 'are', 'cameos', 'Gen.', 'David', 'Shoup', 'Major', ""'Jim"", 'Crowe', 'veterans', 'leaders', 'battle', 'Tarawa', 'scene', 'were', 'Stryker', 'given', 'command', 'stay', 'put', 'so', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'thinness', 'understrength', 'line', 'enemy', 'how', 'far', 'will', 'go', 'carry', 'out', 'orders', 'matter', 'how', 'terrible', 'circumstances', 'personal', 'pain', 'cost', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'sequence', 'complete', 'cameos', 'three', 'surviving', 'flag', 'raisers', 'Surabachi', 'front', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'graphic', 'would', 'want', 'era', ""'Saving"", 'Private', 'Ryan', 'realism', 'human', 'cost', 'sacrifice', 'always', 'portrayed', 'negative', 'reviewers', 'must', 'put', 'perspective', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'released', '1949', 'movie', 'day', 'was', 'full', 'about', 'much', 'realism', 'was', 'allowed', 'Marine', '24', 'years', 'active', 'service', 'say', 'something', 'when', 'day', 'Marines', 'want', 'have', 'positive', 'virtues', 'Sgt', 'Stryker', 'enduring', 'legacy', 'left', 'toughest', 'Marines', 'past', 'embodied', 'truly', 'iconic', 'film']",Sands of Iwo Jima
