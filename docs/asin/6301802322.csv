269395,A1DS5AROCQZ4L6,6301802322,40yo Average American White Guy,"[3, 15]","So-so idiot teen comedy, memorable pretty much only for an appealing performance by John Cusack in one of his first lead roles.Plot: various social misfits vie for respect with the cool kids, finding self-respect, and love, on the way. (Never seen THAT flick before, huh?)My two cents: I've gotta give writer/director Holland credit for inventiveness and guts: he puts it all out there. But... he puts it ALL out there, and for every bit that really works, there's one that really doesn't. David Odgen Stiers as the concerned dad is appealing; Kim Darby as the over-the-top mom is appalling. The foreign-exchange student routine works well enough; the drug-challenged best friend doesn't. Thumbs-down to the talking scribbles, singing burgers and the whole skiing subplot; thumbs-up to the Howard Cosell drag-racers, the over-achieving little brother and the endless series of guys wanting to hit on Cusack's ex.If you really want to see a five-star comedy about a disoriented kid with a suicide complex, check out ""Harold and Maude"". And, if you want to see the five-star romantic comedy starring John Cusack, it's called ""Say Anything"".Verdict: rent it.",3,"Overrated By Its Fans, But Entertaining Anyway",1053388800,"05 20, 2003",2003,1155,"['So-so', 'idiot', 'teen', 'comedy', 'memorable', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'appealing', 'performance', 'John', 'Cusack', 'one', 'first', 'lead', 'roles.Plot', 'various', 'social', 'misfits', 'vie', 'respect', 'cool', 'kids', 'finding', 'self-respect', 'love', 'way', 'Never', 'seen', 'THAT', 'flick', 'huh', 'two', 'cents', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'give', 'writer/director', 'Holland', 'credit', 'inventiveness', 'guts', 'there', 'there', 'bit', 'really', 'one', 'really', ""n't"", 'David', 'Odgen', 'Stiers', 'concerned', 'dad', 'appealing', 'Kim', 'Darby', 'over-the-top', 'mom', 'appalling', 'foreign-exchange', 'student', 'routine', 'well', 'enough', 'drug-challenged', 'best', 'friend', ""n't"", 'Thumbs-down', 'talking', 'scribbles', 'singing', 'burgers', 'whole', 'skiing', 'subplot', 'thumbs-up', 'Howard', 'Cosell', 'drag-racers', 'over-achieving', 'little', 'brother', 'endless', 'series', 'guys', 'wanting', 'hit', 'Cusack', 'ex.If', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'five-star', 'comedy', 'disoriented', 'kid', 'suicide', 'complex', 'check', 'Harold', 'Maude', 'want', 'see', 'five-star', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'starring', 'John', 'Cusack', 'called', 'Say', 'Anything', '.Verdict', 'rent']",Better Off Dead VHS

When he showed the product to his friends, they couldn't stop laughing, so  he went with the flow and just made it funnier and funnier.John Cusack,  as we all know, rocks.  He rocks on in this movie, like in all his other  ones I've ever seen.  For me, I think the thing that worked best about this  movie is the sheer concatenation of random, bizarre subplots.  The  homicidal newspaper boy who wants his 2 dollars; the Japanese brothers who  learned to speak English by watching Howard Cosell; Lane's mutant pal,  played by the actor who played &quot;Booger&quot; in &quot;Revenge of the  Nerds&quot;; Lane's effortlessly brilliant little brother, who gets  everything he wants while Lane's life goes to hell; Lane's monumentally  un-hip father, who wants to be cool; and the disgusting fat kid who has the  hots for his french exchange student;  sue me, but it all works.It is  also a movie that doesn't really take itself too seriously.

269397,A13QNGUB9IYTY4,6301802322,"A Hermit ""J.Hamric""","[1, 1]","""Better Off Dead"" is the debut of ""Savage"" Steve Holland, a story loosely based on Savage's own life as a youth dealing with frustration, depression, and unrequited love. These are dark, somber themes, but for some reason, they can collude into a very funny film, one for the ages.""Better Off..."" starts off with, after a brief animated sequence by Holland, the early morning hours of the Myer household; Lane (John Cusak) arising from his bed amid literally hundreds of pictures of the girl of his dreams, Beth (Amanda Weiss). His father (David Ogden Stiers) is stirring out of bed in a bit of a rush to get outside and open the garage door before the newspaper is delivered, as the carrier has a history of breaking the windows on the garage door by carelessly throwing the rolled-up paper at the house, invariably smashing the all garage door's windows. Like several scenes in the film, the pacing, camera angles, and soundtrack are very good parodies of old Hitchcock-type horror films. The comic effect is priceless.Lane's mother, portrayed by Kim Darby, is a very nice, easy-going lady who is completely incompetent when it comes to preparing meals, and her creations, comprised of inedible messes, appear several times throughout, such as this disgusting greenish blue glop she says is bacon she boiled to avoid creating grease. Nasty, but hilarious. She's a sweetheart, but has no business in the kitchen.David Schneider is Ricky Smith, the freak of nature living next door, the only child of a chain-smoking caricature of the prototypical overbearing mother. Friendly, but obnoxious and completely inconsiderate, she smothers her precious misfit son with affection and has sheltered him from the world, and when they celebrate Christmas, Ricky's gift to the foreign exchange student living there is quite funny, yet pathetic. The French foreign exchange student, Monique (Diane Franklin) is a sympathetic character, trapped in the Smith home and forced to pretend she doesn't speak a word of English to avoid interacting with these people. She's pretty, she's resourceful, and she has developed an interest in her new neighbor Lane, but Lane is heartbroken over Beth dumping him for ski captain Roy Stalin (Aaron Dozier). Stalin is a real jerk; he's boorish and self-centered, and woefully, all too typical. So there is a double love-triangle here, as Lane wants to get back with Beth, who is now with Roy. Ricky desires Monique, who wants to be with Lane, who, as I said, wants to get back with Beth.Every nuance of this film is perfectly placed, the songs in the soundtrack, the lives of the characters, the references to other film genres, and the type-casting of many of the characters, main, and incidental. For instance one will remember the owner of the hamburger stand as Porky, from the ""Porky's"" films of the era, and Curtis Armstrong, from ""Revenge Of The Nerds."" And ""Beth's"" biggest claim to fame is the distinction of being the first of Freddy Kruger's victims in the ""Elm Street"" series. This film is literally everything from the middle 1980s, a golden time for movie fans, especially the comedies and horror films of that time. I didn't realize it until much later, but this was a special time for this, as so many of today's remakes prove.This is seriously one of the funniest, most uplifting films I have ever seen.",5,"""I Love The 80's"" ~ One of the best films of the decade",1311033600,"07 19, 2011",2011,3343,"['Better', 'Off', 'Dead', 'debut', 'Savage', 'Steve', 'Holland', 'story', 'loosely', 'based', 'Savage', 'own', 'life', 'youth', 'dealing', 'frustration', 'depression', 'unrequited', 'love', 'are', 'dark', 'somber', 'themes', 'reason', 'can', 'collude', 'very', 'funny', 'film', 'one', 'ages', 'Better', 'Off', 'brief', 'animated', 'sequence', 'Holland', 'early', 'morning', 'hours', 'Myer', 'household', 'Lane', 'John', 'Cusak', 'arising', 'bed', 'literally', 'hundreds', 'pictures', 'girl', 'dreams', 'Beth', 'Amanda', 'Weiss', 'father', 'David', 'Ogden', 'Stiers', 'stirring', 'bed', 'bit', 'rush', 'get', 'outside', 'open', 'garage', 'door', 'newspaper', 'delivered', 'carrier', 'history', 'breaking', 'windows', 'garage', 'door', 'carelessly', 'throwing', 'rolled-up', 'paper', 'house', 'invariably', 'smashing', 'garage', 'door', 'windows', 'several', 'scenes', 'film', 'pacing', 'camera', 'angles', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'parodies', 'old', 'Hitchcock-type', 'horror', 'films', 'comic', 'effect', 'priceless.Lane', 'mother', 'portrayed', 'Kim', 'Darby', 'very', 'nice', 'easy-going', 'lady', 'who', 'completely', 'incompetent', 'when', 'preparing', 'meals', 'creations', 'comprised', 'inedible', 'messes', 'appear', 'several', 'times', 'such', 'disgusting', 'greenish', 'blue', 'glop', 'bacon', 'boiled', 'avoid', 'creating', 'grease', 'Nasty', 'hilarious', 'sweetheart', 'business', 'kitchen.David', 'Schneider', 'Ricky', 'Smith', 'freak', 'nature', 'living', 'next', 'door', 'only', 'child', 'chain-smoking', 'caricature', 'prototypical', 'overbearing', 'mother', 'Friendly', 'obnoxious', 'completely', 'inconsiderate', 'precious', 'misfit', 'son', 'affection', 'sheltered', 'world', 'when', 'celebrate', 'Christmas', 'Ricky', 'gift', 'foreign', 'exchange', 'student', 'living', 'quite', 'funny', 'yet', 'pathetic', 'French', 'foreign', 'exchange', 'student', 'Monique', 'Diane', 'Franklin', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'trapped', 'Smith', 'home', 'forced', 'pretend', ""n't"", 'speak', 'word', 'English', 'avoid', 'interacting', 'people', 'pretty', 'resourceful', 'developed', 'interest', 'new', 'neighbor', 'Lane', 'Lane', 'heartbroken', 'Beth', 'dumping', 'ski', 'captain', 'Roy', 'Stalin', 'Aaron', 'Dozier', 'Stalin', 'real', 'jerk', 'boorish', 'self-centered', 'woefully', 'too', 'typical', 'double', 'love-triangle', 'here', 'Lane', 'get', 'back', 'Beth', 'who', 'now', 'Roy', 'Ricky', 'Monique', 'who', 'be', 'Lane', 'who', 'said', 'get', 'back', 'Beth.Every', 'nuance', 'film', 'perfectly', 'placed', 'songs', 'soundtrack', 'lives', 'characters', 'references', 'other', 'film', 'genres', 'type-casting', 'many', 'characters', 'main', 'incidental', 'instance', 'one', 'will', 'remember', 'owner', 'hamburger', 'stand', 'Porky', 'Porky', 'films', 'era', 'Curtis', 'Armstrong', 'Revenge', 'Nerds', 'Beth', 'biggest', 'claim', 'fame', 'distinction', 'being', 'first', 'Freddy', 'Kruger', 'victims', 'Elm', 'Street', 'series', 'film', 'literally', 'everything', 'middle', '1980s', 'golden', 'time', 'movie', 'fans', 'especially', 'comedies', 'horror', 'films', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'much', 'later', 'was', 'special', 'time', 'so', 'many', 'today', 'remakes', 'prove.This', 'seriously', 'one', 'funniest', 'most', 'uplifting', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen']",Better Off Dead VHS

However entertaining this movie is, there are several scenes  which I felt could have easily been cut from the movie without disrupting  the plot.

269403,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,6301802322,Andre Dursin,"[2, 2]","An `80s cult classic has reached Blu-Ray at last: Savage Steve Holland's high school comedy BETTER OFF DEAD, which I recall being released not once but twice locally in my home state of Rhode Island during 1985.The first time was a late August trial run before its eventual October nationwide roll-out, which boasted a different ad campaign (this happened again for no apparent reason years later with ""The Lawnmower Man,"" which opened three weeks ahead of time in the Ocean State than it did around the rest of the nation. For what it's worth, we were also the only market that received a theatrical run of Larry Cohen's ""A Return to Salem's Lot"" too).John Cusack netted his first lead role here as Lane Meyer, a typical high schooler who loses the girl of his dreams to an obnoxious jock -- and spends the rest of his life trying to summon the will to go on. Naturally, he does, winning the affection of a beautiful French exchange student trapped with an insane family next door, and attempting to beat the pretty boy ski team captain at his own game.The plot may sound familiar but Holland -- who wrote and directed the film -- throws in absurdist humor, stop-motion animation, and knowingly satirizes high school in one memorable scene after another. My favorite sequence comes when Cusack is called upon to answer a geometry question in Vincent Schiavelli's class, filled with suck-up geeks who laugh at the teacher's every move (it definitely wasn't hard for me to identify with the young protagonist in this scene -- it's something you've had to have lived through to understand!). Curtis Armstrong is hysterical as Cusack's wacky best friend, Diane Franklin is ideal as the cute French girl, while David Ogden Stiers is great as Cusack's befuddled dad -- the sequences with Cusack and Stiers reacting to mom Kim Darby's Christmas presents is yet another gem in a film filled with smart observations and big laughs.CBS' Blu-Ray of ""Better Off Dead"" looks terrific. There's a bit of dirt and noise here and there but the image itself is freed from any heavy use of DNR. The movie's 5.1 DTS MA track seems to have been remixed from a mono source as a lot of it sounds flat, but it's fine overall, and the original trailer is included.

(1985) stars John Cusack in a cute little tale of thwarted love, teen angst, and how Lane Meyer (Cusack) overcomes his broken heart and death wish.Lots of interesting folks here-- Kim Darby (remember her inTRUE GRIT, from 1969?) as John's eccentric mom, whose cooking fetish manifests in bizarre meals; his kid brother (Scooter Stevens)-- the expert in mail-order mayhem; his dad (David Ogden Stiers), truly a man on a mission: to keep the garage door windows from breaking!Beyond the family circle we have Lane's best pal, oddball Charles De Mar (Curtis Armstrong) and his top hat-- Charles likes to carry a pig fetus in a formaldehyde jar and snort real snow off a mountainside.More weirdos: loudmouth next door neighbor Mrs. Smith (Laura Waterbury) and her porcine geekoid son Ricky (Dan Schneider). Mama keeps forcing Ricky on their foreign exchange student visitor from France, Monique Junot (Diane Franklin), who pretends to not know English to avoid having to speak to the Smiths. Monique is the ultimate key to Lane's rise from the ashes of Dumped Boyfriendville.As if he didn't have enough worries, Lane's steps are dogged by a pair of Japanese brothers (one sounds like Howard Cosell) who seem to pop up at every red light to challenge Lane to a drag race. They're played by Yuji Okumoto and Brian Imada. Then there's Johnny Gasparini (Demien Slade), the newspaperboy from hell-- Lane doesn't have the two bucks his family owes for 20 papers and he can't shake this annoyance, not even when Johnny and bike fall off a snow-covered cliff.Lane's ex, Beth Truss (Amanda Wysss) is now dating school jock Roy Stalin (Aaron Dozier) and everyone from a math teacher (Vincent Schiavelli) to the mailman (Taylor Negron) to Barney Rubble (Rich Little) ask Lane's permission to have a shot at Beth. These importunings drive him from sadness to despair, and in a moment of macho insanity Lane dares Roy to ski race him down killer slope K12. Now he's got no choice but to meet the hated foe on Sunday at high noon.....",4,"""You ski the K-12 dude, and girls will go sterile just looking at you!""",1246924800,"07 7, 2009",2009,2035,"['BETTER', 'OFF', 'DEAD', '1985', 'John', 'Cusack', 'cute', 'little', 'tale', 'thwarted', 'love', 'teen', 'angst', 'how', 'Lane', 'Meyer', 'Cusack', 'broken', 'heart', 'death', 'wish.Lots', 'interesting', 'folks', 'here', 'Kim', 'Darby', 'remember', 'inTRUE', 'GRIT', '1969', 'John', 'eccentric', 'mom', 'cooking', 'fetish', 'manifests', 'bizarre', 'meals', 'kid', 'brother', 'Scooter', 'Stevens', 'expert', 'mail-order', 'mayhem', 'dad', 'David', 'Ogden', 'Stiers', 'truly', 'man', 'mission', 'keep', 'garage', 'door', 'windows', 'breaking', 'family', 'circle', 'have', 'Lane', 'best', 'pal', 'oddball', 'Charles', 'De', 'Mar', 'Curtis', 'Armstrong', 'top', 'hat', 'Charles', 'carry', 'pig', 'fetus', 'formaldehyde', 'jar', 'snort', 'real', 'snow', 'off', 'mountainside.More', 'weirdos', 'loudmouth', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'Laura', 'Waterbury', 'porcine', 'geekoid', 'son', 'Ricky', 'Dan', 'Schneider', 'Mama', 'forcing', 'Ricky', 'foreign', 'exchange', 'student', 'visitor', 'France', 'Monique', 'Junot', 'Diane', 'Franklin', 'who', 'not', 'know', 'English', 'avoid', 'having', 'speak', 'Smiths', 'Monique', 'ultimate', 'key', 'Lane', 'rise', 'ashes', 'Dumped', 'Boyfriendville.As', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'worries', 'Lane', 'steps', 'are', 'dogged', 'pair', 'Japanese', 'brothers', 'one', 'Howard', 'Cosell', 'who', 'seem', 'pop', 'up', 'red', 'light', 'challenge', 'Lane', 'drag', 'race', ""'re"", 'played', 'Yuji', 'Okumoto', 'Brian', 'Imada', 'Then', 'Johnny', 'Gasparini', 'Demien', 'Slade', 'newspaperboy', 'hell', 'Lane', ""n't"", 'have', 'two', 'bucks', 'family', '20', 'papers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shake', 'annoyance', 'not', 'even', 'when', 'Johnny', 'bike', 'fall', 'snow-covered', 'cliff.Lane', 'ex', 'Beth', 'Truss', 'Amanda', 'Wysss', 'now', 'dating', 'school', 'jock', 'Roy', 'Stalin', 'Aaron', 'Dozier', 'everyone', 'math', 'teacher', 'Vincent', 'Schiavelli', 'mailman', 'Taylor', 'Negron', 'Barney', 'Rubble', 'Rich', 'Little', 'ask', 'Lane', 'permission', 'have', 'shot', 'Beth', 'importunings', 'drive', 'sadness', 'despair', 'moment', 'macho', 'insanity', 'Lane', 'Roy', 'ski', 'race', 'down', 'killer', 'slope', 'K12', 'Now', 'got', 'choice', 'meet', 'hated', 'foe', 'Sunday', 'high', 'noon', '..']",Better Off Dead VHS

With all of the other teen/school comedies of that era, it's no wonder this appealing and funny film got lost in the mix. John Cusack stars as Lane Myer, a normal kid with a not so normal family. His mom is a little off her rocker. She cooks horrendous food and makes deer coats for Christmas. His little brother tries to pick up trashy women. Lane's Dad is battling the paperboy. But, worst of all, Lane doesn't make the ski team and his beloved girlfriend, Beth, dumps him for some pukey captain of the ski team. Then, Lane meets a cute foreign exchange student who's staying with his obese neighbors. Lane tries to win her love as does the son of the family she's staying with. The movie is funny. Dan Schneider, as neighbor Ricky, is downright hilarious. An underrated comedic performance. Cusack, as always, is solid and appealing. The remaining cast includes Curtis(Revenge Of The Nerds)armstrong, Vincent Schiavelli, David Ogden Stiers FROM &quot;Mash&quot;, and Kim(True Grit)Darby. There's even a cute animation sequence involving hamburger. You heard me right. The onrunning joke about a psycho paperboy is pretty funny.

High definition does not translate to a miraculous transformation. It simply allows you to experience more closely what the source elements have to offer. In the case of Better Off Dead, it had a very low budget and was made very quickly. The filmmakers weren't concerned with how great the shots could be artistically, since it's a screwball comedy for teenagers. The low quality 80's film stock that was used wasn't great with detail, depth, or color, and was quite unstable. The film's soundtrack, which was originally in mono, was created with basic sound effects and design, because that's all the budget allowed for. The film will never look amazing no matter how much restoration is done to it and it'll never sound amazing unless an entirely new sound mix with new sound effects is created. It is a product of its low budget source limitations and unless you accept that fact, you will be greatly disappointed.On the positive side, the print is clean and full of natural film grain. It's the best I've ever seen it look. The sound is exactly as it has always been, thin, lifeless and limited in range, though dialogue is always intelligible. The downside of this release is there are no special features. No retrospective, or appreciation, or commentary. I'm not surprised considering how limited the fan base is for the film.This is the best presentation of Better Off Dead to date and I'm sure it could never be much better than it is on blu-ray.

As a young man he played in a number of comedies and this is certainly a good one. When his girlfriend breaks up with him he thinks it's the end of the world. The fact that just about everything in his room has her picture on it let's us in on the fact he may be slightly over the edge. To say he was slightly obsessed with her is putting it mildly. Eventually he meets a foreign exchange student and she helps him through his crisis. Her reason for seeking out John is twofold. She thinks he's funny and the family she is living with is mental. The mother wants her to be her sons girlfriend and he still plays with dolls and would give Porky Pig a run for his money at the food trough. When it looks like John will get his old girlfriend back we see the age old question of the two ""H's"", hormones or honesty. Fun movie especially for fans of 80's movies.

He also had to work the hardest for the girls to look at him and not pass him over  for the buff blonde jock dude.Whether it was One Crazy Summer, Say  Anything or Better Off Dead. Even in movies where he has the girl, like Hot  Pursuit, he doesn't have it easy.Better Off Dead represent's Lane  &quot;Oscar&quot; Meyer's nightmare.  He has just lost his girlfriend,  doesn't make it on the Ski Team, has the boss from hell and even his 9 year  old brother is picking up trashy women, while he can't get any.  Oh yeah,  there's a psychotic paperboy after him for $2. The movie is about him  trying to win back the love of his woman, while not seeing the love that is  shown right in front of his face in the form of a perky French Exchange  Student.Of course, this isn't a &quot;real&quot; High School Movie, but  an allegory of what High School Students feel they go through.  It's like a  yearbook that has come to life.  On that level, it works very well.  I  always crack up when I see those wacky scenes like Lane being constantly  challenged by the Japanese version of Howard Cosell, or finding interesting  new ways to commit suicide.  It hits a little closer to home because when  the movie came out in 1985, I was in the throws of HS society and it had  more of an impact that it would to younger kids today (who may see Clueless  as a more relevant film).Cusack (like all his other movies) plays the  straight (if  slightly bewildered) male lead and we feel sorry for what he  goes through.  Whether it is dueling Ricky Smith for the love of the  exchange student or being creamed by the ENTIRE senior basketball Team, we  all tend to feel for him because he always seems to get the short end of  the stick.  His sidekick, Charles (Curtis Armstrong playing the same way he  did with his character Booger from Revenge of the Nerds), fills in the  moments when Lane becomes a little too serious.However, the movie is so  unserious that it is hard to really get any deeper feeling off the movie.  It is sort of like that guy (or gal) in high school that knew and was  social with everyone, but no one remembers 10 years later because he/she  never tried anything other than surface social friendship with  anyone.Better Off Dead is not a smart comedy like Real Genius, or one  with a message, but it is fun to watch John Cusack for 2 hours play a  person like we used to be, get the girl and become the hero of his little  world.....Rating: C+",3,"John Cusack, King of High School FOREVER!",966384000,"08 16, 2000",2000,2515,"['John', 'Cusack', 'always', 'played', 'underdog', 'teenager', 'days', 'also', 'had', 'work', 'hardest', 'girls', 'look', 'not', 'pass', 'over', 'buff', 'blonde', 'jock', 'dude.Whether', 'was', 'One', 'Crazy', 'Summer', 'Say', 'Anything', 'Better', 'Off', 'Dead', 'Even', 'movies', 'where', 'girl', 'Hot', 'Pursuit', ""n't"", 'have', 'easy.Better', 'Off', 'Dead', 'represent', 'Lane', 'quot', 'Oscar', 'quot', 'Meyer', 'nightmare', 'just', 'lost', 'girlfriend', ""n't"", 'make', 'Ski', 'Team', 'boss', 'hell', 'even', '9', 'year', 'old', 'brother', 'picking', 'up', 'trashy', 'women', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'psychotic', 'paperboy', '2', 'movie', 'trying', 'win', 'back', 'love', 'woman', 'not', 'seeing', 'love', 'shown', 'right', 'front', 'face', 'form', 'perky', 'French', 'Exchange', 'Student.Of', 'course', ""n't"", 'quot', 'real', 'quot', 'High', 'School', 'Movie', 'allegory', 'what', 'High', 'School', 'Students', 'feel', 'go', 'yearbook', 'come', 'life', 'level', 'very', 'well', 'always', 'crack', 'up', 'when', 'see', 'wacky', 'scenes', 'Lane', 'being', 'constantly', 'challenged', 'Japanese', 'version', 'Howard', 'Cosell', 'finding', 'interesting', 'new', 'ways', 'commit', 'suicide', 'little', 'closer', 'home', 'when', 'movie', 'came', 'out', '1985', 'was', 'throws', 'HS', 'society', 'had', 'more', 'impact', 'would', 'younger', 'kids', 'today', 'who', 'may', 'see', 'Clueless', 'more', 'relevant', 'film', '.Cusack', 'other', 'movies', 'straight', 'slightly', 'bewildered', 'male', 'lead', 'feel', 'sorry', 'what', 'dueling', 'Ricky', 'Smith', 'love', 'exchange', 'student', 'being', 'creamed', 'ENTIRE', 'senior', 'basketball', 'Team', 'tend', 'feel', 'always', 'get', 'short', 'end', 'stick', 'sidekick', 'Charles', 'Curtis', 'Armstrong', 'playing', 'same', 'way', 'did', 'character', 'Booger', 'Revenge', 'Nerds', 'moments', 'when', 'Lane', 'little', 'too', 'serious.However', 'movie', 'so', 'unserious', 'hard', 'really', 'get', 'deeper', 'feeling', 'movie', 'sort', 'guy', 'gal', 'high', 'school', 'knew', 'was', 'social', 'everyone', 'one', '10', 'years', 'later', 'he/she', 'never', 'tried', 'anything', 'other', 'surface', 'social', 'friendship', 'anyone.Better', 'Off', 'Dead', 'not', 'smart', 'comedy', 'Real', 'Genius', 'one', 'message', 'fun', 'watch', 'John', 'Cusack', '2', 'hours', 'play', 'person', 'used', 'be', 'get', 'girl', 'become', 'hero', 'little', 'world', '..Rating', 'C+']",Better Off Dead VHS

269434,A3RTMB76CJWY9U,6301802322,DonAthos,"[3, 5]","It *may* be that the time for this film has passed.I don't know.I saw this movie for the first time the other day (honestly, I'd never even heard of it before that) and wondered how not even the cult-circles I travel in had picked up on it. So, I came here to read the reviews and write one of my own, as I invariably do, when I read another review complaining that this film isn't ""edgy,"" ""surreal,"" or ""cerebral"" enough. And, it occured to me--""you're not from the 80s, are you?""That review was written by someone who grew up in the 90s. I just know it. The 80s teen comedy is... its own thing. It is a unique genre, and it saw life for only a few years. The 80s teen comedy didn't need to be particularly edgy, etc. Its strengths are that it is satiric without being cruel, whimsical without being fluffy and, almost above all else, sincere. And, I'm just not sure that the youth of today (""Generation Y"" *cough*) are in a position to appreciate it. I think that this might be one of the early signs that culture has moved on....That said, let me actually review this film! :)Better Off Dead is an archetypal 80s teen comedy. It has the pointlessly mean, girlfriend-stealing jock. The well-meaning, loser central character. The odd, but loyal, best friend (Revenge of the Nerds' Booger, no less!). The comic parents who just never understand. And, of course, it ends in the ""big challenge"" between the loser-hero and the jock (a ski race) with the stakes being the girl they've contended for.Beyond that, it has an interestingly eccentric kind of comedy (like the Japanese street racers, who continually challenge our hero in the voice of Howard Cosell). It features sequences in animation, and some rudimentary special effects and, despite what our 90s born reviewer might think, is actually pretty advanced for its time.Not all of the elements always work, but enough do to make this an interesting and charming comedy.

Occasionally it ventures too far into the realm of the absurd, such as the scene where Cusack's character daydreams a romancing pair of claymation cheeseburgers (which, naturally, pantomime to Van Halen), but it's also those dalliances into surrealism that provide many of its best moments.

There was nothing shocking or vulgar about films like ""The Breakfast Club"", ""Pretty in Pink"" or ""Better Off Dead"". There is such an innocence to the films that is sorely lacking in today's brand of teen comedies. ""Better Off Dead"" is one of the funniest movies I have ever had the pleasure of watching as a teenager. John Cusack plays Lane Myer who ends up getting dumped by his highschool sweetheart Beth for the captain of the ski team. After getting dumped, Lane becomes suicidal and attempts to off himself but every time he tries to he fails. His family is totally oblivious to Lane's attempts at suicide. The mother is the funniest member of Lane's family as she cooks up such horrible food. His father is totally oblivious. And Lane's brother is too busy building rockets. If she wasn't hilarious enough, there is Lane's best friend who will just about snort up anything from jello to snow through a straw. Eventually Lane meets the French foreign exchange student who is living with this fat nerd and his obsessive mother. With her help, Lane comes out of his deep funk. One of my personal favorite moments in the film is when Lane daydreams at his job that the fast food he cooks comes to life. I also loved it when Lane sticks q-tips in every orifice on his face. And who can forget about the psychotic paper boy who chases after Lane throughout the entire movie? The characters in this film are all hysterically funny and unforgettable.

269450,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6301802322,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","Better Off Dead is an unabashedly wacky, sometimes dark teen comedy which contains loony animated passages and other similarly implausible scenes. But thru all the juvenile sight gags and goofy plot contrivances, there is a standard romantic storyline cleaving to the film. Lane Myer (John Cusack) is a teenage loser who regularly undergoes excruciatingly embarrasing moments in high school. Losing his lovely girl Beth (Amanda Wyss) to Roy, the popular but arrogant school ski captain, seems par for the course. Everyone wants to go out with Beth, from the local mailman, to Lane's teacher, to even one of Lane's cartoon creations. Lane decides to kill himself in a series of hilarious not-to-be-taken-serious segments. Things kind of turn around for him when Monique, a sexy French exchange student, comes to stay with his weird neighbors. Lane, with Monique's help, tries to win Beth back by ski racing Roy down the daunting slopes of the K-12.John Cusack is SO the man! There's just something about him. Two of my favorite teen movies of the '80s star Cusack (The Sure Thing and Say Anything). And, somehow, his charm and sympathetic average guy sensibilities hold this zany picture together. Diane Franklin (who?) is very winsome as the foreign exchange student Monique Junot. The movie's antagonists -  Roy Stalin and Ricky Smith - are despicable and annoying enough that the viewer feels a justified sense of euphoria when they, at last, meet their comeuppance.This film has an energetic, almost manic, pulse. Some of the zany gags are realized thru Lane's wild imagination and daydreams. The rest, however, is warped director Savage Steve Holland asking us to take the lunacy in stride, and because of the good humor inherent in the film, we do. My preferred scenes of dippiness are the flashbacks of when Lane and Beth were together, all the moments with the beautiful and daring Monique, and whenever that murderous newspaper boy is persecuting Lane, all for the sake of ""two dollars.""The film's outrageous tone is abetted by the cast of oddball characters. Lane's best friend Charles (Curtis Armstrong, aka Booger from the Revenge of the Nerds films), who snorts everything in sight, has been attending the same high school for 7 and a half years (but, hey, he's no dummy). Naturally, the grim, relentlessly single-minded newspaper boy who stalks Lane throughout the film is a full out riot. Then there's Lane's precocious younger brother, who likes to party with older women and tinker with science fiction gadgetry (seems like an innocent hobby til the kid zooms away in his own space shuttle).

It is filled with humor, sorrow, the total absurd (i.e., Cusack's mother and her creative &quot;meals&quot;), etc.  It definitely belongs in the same class as the John Hughes films (Pretty in Pink, Sixteen Candles...which has another Cusack cameo, Breakfast Club, etc.) as well as the much-loved Cameron Crowe written &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High.&quot;Definitely get this film and laugh and cry all over again.

269459,AZ1UFPNARPZD2,6301802322,"Jeffrey Ellis ""bored recluse""","[111, 118]","As the years go by, I find myself growing more and more convinced that the '80s were the last true golden age for that often-maligned genre, the teen sex comedy.  Whereas now Hollywood shells out a small fortune to finance a Britney Spears soundtrack for films starring young men who make Frankie Avalon look complex (and featuring actresses who seem to have copied Annette Funnicello's bust but none of her own admitedly simple charm), the '80s were usually made with low budgets, up-and-coming young actors who at least seemed to be having fun, scripts that were too joyfully crude to ever be considered truly offensive, and directors who seem to have vanished at the decade's in.  My own personal favorite amongst these directors was &quot;Savage&quot; Steve Holland (Is that a perfect '80s name or what?) who defined the entire decade with just two films -- One Crazy Summer and especially Better Off Dead.  Both of these films display Holland's crazed, gloriously strange wit, his penchant for casting Curtis Armstrong as a high school students (despite the fact that Armstrong appeared to be in his 30s at the time), his fondness for the random nonsensical cartoon, and especially his early foresight to make John Cusack his favored star.In Better Off Dead, Cusack plays a likeable but nerdy high school schlub.  Of course, all teen films claim to be about likeable schlubs but Cusack was one of the few actors who was actually believable as being both likeable and socially unpopular.  He's dumped by his girlfriend, decides to beat her new boyfriend in a ski competition, attempts suicide a few times -- in a bit that everyone seems to hold as their personal favorite -- has to deal with a homicidal paper boy who wants his two dollars.  Its a crazed plot and Holland doesn't waste much time trying to make it all coherent.  Instead, he uses the plot as an excuse to pile on more and more strange sight gags and bizarre characters.  In short, rather than pretending his story is some sort of grand artistic statement (like the current crop of youth films), Holland creates his own demented world -- a world where high school students are sent into almost religious ecstacy when their math teacer assigns them 200 pages of homework (their sincerely joyful reaction is my own personal favorite of the film's many out-there moments) and even a cartoon comes to life and asks permission to date Cusack's ex.  Its a world where one of my favorite, unjustly unknown actresses of that era -- the sweetly pretty Diana Franklin -- shows up as a French exchange student who offers Cusack a chance at true romance if only he can survive a &quot;fencing&quot; match with an even more nerdy suitor.  Its a world where a Japanese exchange student does a perfect imitation of Howard Cosell.  In short, its a world that could only have been created in the freedom-loving days of the 1980s and John Cusack becomes the perfect everyman to lead us through that world.  There are so many hilarious lines in Better off Dead and it seems everyone has their own personal favorite (&quot;Its a shame people be throwing out a perfectly good white boy like that&quot; comes up a lot though Armstrong shouting &quot;Can you imagine the street value of this&quot; as he snorts up a line of white snow is my own choice).  What is truly amazing is that for a film that was dismissed when it originally opened, Better off Dead seems to have become the personal &quot;cult&quot; film of just about everyone who went to high school during the 1980s.Cusack is one of the best actors working today but, for many of his long-time fans, his recent work has been a bit disappointing.  Since renouncing the whole teen film thing, some of Cusack's performances have -- on occasion -- seemed to be a case of an actor taking himself too seriously.  Even if the films did little for his career, Cusack seemed to, at least, be having fun in films like Better off Dead -- a quality that sometimes appears to missing from his &quot;mature&quot; work.  Of course, everyone in Better Off Dead seems to be having fun.  Its a fun, genuinely goon natured film and this is why -- despite being dismissed by snobs over the years -- it retains such a strong following.  Whenever I see a commercial for yet another film featuring Freddie Prinze, Jr. doing his &quot;soulful&quot; thing while the Backstreet Boys parade in the background, I think of Better Off Dead and its missing director.  Come back, Savage Steve and -- whatever you have to do -- bring John Cusack with you.  We all deserve to have a little fun again.",5,"Come back, Savage Steve!",1009152000,"12 24, 2001",2001,4574,"['years', 'go', 'find', 'growing', 'more', 'more', 'convinced', ""'80s"", 'were', 'last', 'true', 'golden', 'age', 'often-maligned', 'genre', 'teen', 'sex', 'comedy', 'Whereas', 'now', 'Hollywood', 'shells', 'out', 'small', 'fortune', 'finance', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'soundtrack', 'films', 'starring', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'make', 'Frankie', 'Avalon', 'look', 'complex', 'featuring', 'actresses', 'who', 'seem', 'have', 'copied', 'Annette', 'Funnicello', 'bust', 'none', 'own', 'admitedly', 'simple', 'charm', ""'80s"", 'were', 'usually', 'made', 'low', 'budgets', 'up-and-coming', 'young', 'actors', 'who', 'least', 'seemed', 'be', 'having', 'fun', 'scripts', 'were', 'too', 'joyfully', 'crude', 'ever', 'be', 'considered', 'truly', 'offensive', 'directors', 'who', 'seem', 'have', 'vanished', 'decade', 'own', 'personal', 'favorite', 'directors', 'was', 'quot', 'Savage', 'quot', 'Steve', 'Holland', 'perfect', ""'80s"", 'name', 'what', 'who', 'defined', 'entire', 'decade', 'just', 'two', 'films', 'One', 'Crazy', 'Summer', 'especially', 'Better', 'Off', 'Dead', 'films', 'display', 'Holland', 'crazed', 'gloriously', 'strange', 'wit', 'penchant', 'casting', 'Curtis', 'Armstrong', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'fact', 'Armstrong', 'appeared', 'be', '30s', 'time', 'fondness', 'random', 'nonsensical', 'cartoon', 'especially', 'early', 'foresight', 'make', 'John', 'Cusack', 'favored', 'star.In', 'Better', 'Off', 'Dead', 'Cusack', 'likeable', 'nerdy', 'high', 'school', 'schlub', 'course', 'teen', 'films', 'claim', 'be', 'likeable', 'schlubs', 'Cusack', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'actors', 'who', 'was', 'actually', 'believable', 'being', 'likeable', 'socially', 'unpopular', 'dumped', 'girlfriend', 'beat', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'ski', 'competition', 'attempts', 'suicide', 'few', 'times', 'bit', 'everyone', 'hold', 'personal', 'favorite', 'deal', 'homicidal', 'paper', 'boy', 'who', 'two', 'dollars', 'crazed', 'plot', 'Holland', ""n't"", 'waste', 'much', 'time', 'trying', 'make', 'coherent', 'Instead', 'plot', 'excuse', 'pile', 'more', 'more', 'strange', 'sight', 'gags', 'bizarre', 'characters', 'short', 'rather', 'pretending', 'story', 'sort', 'grand', 'artistic', 'statement', 'current', 'crop', 'youth', 'films', 'Holland', 'own', 'demented', 'world', 'world', 'where', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'are', 'sent', 'almost', 'religious', 'ecstacy', 'when', 'math', 'teacer', '200', 'pages', 'homework', 'sincerely', 'joyful', 'reaction', 'own', 'personal', 'favorite', 'film', 'many', 'out-there', 'moments', 'even', 'cartoon', 'life', 'permission', 'date', 'Cusack', 'ex', 'world', 'where', 'one', 'favorite', 'unjustly', 'unknown', 'actresses', 'era', 'sweetly', 'pretty', 'Diana', 'Franklin', 'up', 'French', 'exchange', 'student', 'who', 'Cusack', 'chance', 'true', 'romance', 'only', 'can', 'survive', 'quot', 'fencing', 'quot', 'match', 'even', 'more', 'nerdy', 'suitor', 'world', 'where', 'Japanese', 'exchange', 'student', 'perfect', 'imitation', 'Howard', 'Cosell', 'short', 'world', 'could', 'only', 'have', 'been', 'created', 'freedom-loving', 'days', '1980s', 'John', 'Cusack', 'perfect', 'everyman', 'lead', 'world', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'hilarious', 'lines', 'Better', 'Dead', 'everyone', 'own', 'personal', 'favorite', 'quot', 'shame', 'people', 'be', 'throwing', 'out', 'perfectly', 'good', 'white', 'boy', 'quot', 'up', 'lot', 'Armstrong', 'shouting', 'quot', 'Can', 'imagine', 'street', 'value', 'quot', 'up', 'line', 'white', 'snow', 'own', 'choice', 'What', 'truly', 'amazing', 'film', 'was', 'dismissed', 'when', 'originally', 'opened', 'Better', 'off', 'Dead', 'have', 'become', 'personal', 'quot', 'cult', 'quot', 'film', 'just', 'everyone', 'who', 'went', 'high', 'school', '1980s.Cusack', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'working', 'today', 'many', 'long-time', 'fans', 'recent', 'work', 'been', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'renouncing', 'whole', 'teen', 'film', 'thing', 'Cusack', 'performances', 'have', 'occasion', 'seemed', 'be', 'case', 'actor', 'taking', 'too', 'seriously', 'Even', 'films', 'did', 'little', 'career', 'Cusack', 'seemed', 'least', 'be', 'having', 'fun', 'films', 'Better', 'off', 'Dead', 'quality', 'sometimes', 'missing', 'quot', 'mature', 'quot', 'work', 'course', 'everyone', 'Better', 'Off', 'Dead', 'be', 'having', 'fun', 'fun', 'genuinely', 'goon', 'natured', 'film', 'why', 'being', 'dismissed', 'snobs', 'years', 'strong', 'following', 'Whenever', 'see', 'commercial', 'yet', 'film', 'featuring', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'doing', 'quot', 'soulful', 'quot', 'thing', 'Backstreet', 'Boys', 'parade', 'background', 'think', 'Better', 'Off', 'Dead', 'missing', 'director', 'Come', 'back', 'Savage', 'Steve', 'have', 'do', 'bring', 'John', 'Cusack', 'deserve', 'have', 'little', 'fun', 'again']",Better Off Dead VHS

This is a movie with a story we've seen millions of times, but spiced up with plenty of creative sketches that, while they never add anything to the story, they sure make it a lot of fun! Cusack plays Lane, a teenager whose girlfriend has just broken up with him and he feels suicide is the only way out. Meanwhile, across the street a new foreign exchange student has moved in and is being pestered by the nerdy boy of the house. She soon takes an affection to Lane, even though she's never met him. Already, you can make assumptions on how they meet, how much English she really speaks, whether or not Lane will choose her over his ex, Beth, whether Lane will finally defeat the jock whom Beth has hooked up with. It all sounds so predictable. And for the most part it is. But there are so many other factors that make this movie great. Lane's best friend tries to get high on snow and jello; Lane's geography teacher is incredibly boring, but the students are strangely energized in the class; Lane gets a job at a local fast food place and creates a clay-animated living cheeseburger! There's tons more added to the mayhem. The movie may be easy to predict, but it sure has a lot of weird and funny stuff going on.

269481,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,6301802322,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","Okay so maybe this film has already achieved cult status. Not only does it star John Cusak in one of his early leading roles, the director (Savage Steve Holland) disappeared from feature films after this and ONE CRAZY SUMMER only to delve into TV directing. Fans miss him and I include myself in that mix. So what's the movie like? Completely off the wall and hilarious.Cusak stars as Lane Myer, a teen obsessed with his girlfriend Beth (Amanda Wyss). Proof of that is shown early on when we see his closet filled with clothes hung on hangers that each feature a picture of Beth as well as walls covered with her picture. Problems start early on when Lane fails to make the ski team due to the underhanded doings of Roy, the stereotypical jock jerk found in so many movies. To make matters worse, Beth dumps Lane to become Roy's new girlfriend since she decides she needs to step up the social ladder.Despondent, Lane can't figure out a way to get Beth back and so decides to kill himself. Not since HAROLD AND MAUDE have we witnessed the dark humor of attempted suicide. No, that's not a funny topic but when you see Cusak with a rope around his neck deciding not to go through with it only to have his mother (Kim Darby) open the garage door while sweeping knocking him off his stool to struggle...well you get the picture I hope.Lane finally decides that the best way for him to win back Beth is to take on the ultimate challenge, the one hill only the best skiers go down. That's because most end up hospitalized. Lane doesn't quite go there but he doesn't conquer the slope either.As this story is unfolding Lane also gets to see his next door neighbor, the nerdy overweight Ricky (Dan Schneider) doing well. In an attempt to get him a girl Ricky's mother has taken on a foreign exchange student, Monique (Diane Franklin). The problem is Monique has no interests whatsoever in Ricky. And one night she and Lane become friends.The film ends with a final duel between Lane and Roy. Will Lane get Beth back? Will Roy stop being a jerk finally? And what about Lane's best friend Charles (Curtis Armstrong)? Will he finally find something interesting to do or the recreational drugs he seeks in this town?The movie relies on the most absurd things happening for laughs and each and every one of them works. To tell you most would ruin your enjoyment of this film but I'll give you a couple without wrecking them. Remember to always pay your paperboy even if you only owe him two dollars. Never put flammable materials on a dining room table. And if a Cosell sound alike oriental pulls up in a car beside you be ready to race.This movie was pretty much what many teen films in the 80's were all about. Teen angst taken to extreme. But rather than follow the John Hughes pattern of taking these teens seriously, Holland decided in his first feature film directing to make them over the top. And it works hilariously.The film is just now hitting stores in blu-ray format. Does it help it any? Sadly no. The film continues to have a grainy look to it but that's the look it had when it was originally released. We can't expect every film from the past to look pristine in all forms. But for fans of the film having it in blu-ray will be something they'll want to add to their collection. Sadly the extras are non-existent. There is nothing new here.

He ultimately triumphs by beating his arch-nemesis in a skiing contest and choosing, not his ex-girlfriend, but a French foreign exchange student with whom he's found true love. When this movie came out, I loved it, and when I saw it again after ten years or so, I hated it, recognizing too many of the jokes as too broad and silly. But, after this viewing, I can say that I've made my peace with this film. It's not the amazing end-of-all comedies that I remembered from my youth, but it is both clever and evocative, and didn't deserve the mental drubbing I've been giving it for the last two years or so.The movie does a terrific job of melding the surreal experience without compromising the feeling of reality that permeates Lane's life. Almost everything is ridiculously over the top, from a dinner that slides itself off the plate to a couple of asian drag racers, one of whom learned English from watching ESPN and therefore talks like Howard Cosell. Nevertheless, we sympathize with Lane, and really feel his pain when he is the target of derision from his ex-girlfriend, and the high school bullies who make his life miserable. His eccentric best friend (the same actor who played Booger in Revenge of the Nerds) still cracks me up when he responds to a bully's taunts by laughing hysterically ad nauseum, thereby robbing the bully of his fun.",4,It's all about expectations,1104796800,"01 4, 2005",2005,1479,"['John', 'Cusack', 'everyman', 'loser', 'who', 'variety', 'problems', 'trying', 'win', 'back', 'girl', 'dreams', 'ultimately', 'triumphs', 'beating', 'arch-nemesis', 'skiing', 'contest', 'choosing', 'not', 'ex-girlfriend', 'French', 'foreign', 'exchange', 'student', 'whom', 'found', 'true', 'love', 'When', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'loved', 'when', 'saw', 'again', 'ten', 'years', 'so', 'hated', 'recognizing', 'too', 'many', 'jokes', 'too', 'broad', 'silly', 'viewing', 'can', 'say', ""'ve"", 'made', 'peace', 'film', 'not', 'amazing', 'end-of-all', 'comedies', 'remembered', 'youth', 'clever', 'evocative', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'mental', 'drubbing', ""'ve"", 'been', 'giving', 'last', 'two', 'years', 'so.The', 'movie', 'terrific', 'job', 'melding', 'surreal', 'experience', 'compromising', 'feeling', 'reality', 'Lane', 'life', 'Almost', 'everything', 'ridiculously', 'top', 'dinner', 'off', 'plate', 'couple', 'asian', 'drag', 'racers', 'one', 'whom', 'learned', 'English', 'watching', 'ESPN', 'therefore', 'talks', 'Howard', 'Cosell', 'Nevertheless', 'sympathize', 'Lane', 'really', 'feel', 'pain', 'when', 'target', 'derision', 'ex-girlfriend', 'high', 'school', 'bullies', 'who', 'make', 'life', 'miserable', 'eccentric', 'best', 'friend', 'same', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Booger', 'Revenge', 'Nerds', 'still', 'up', 'when', 'bully', 'taunts', 'laughing', 'hysterically', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'thereby', 'robbing', 'bully', 'fun']",Better Off Dead VHS

On the day of try-outs, Lane is unjustly excluded from his school's ski team and dumped by Beth for the obnoxious jock who was responsible. Lane half-heartedly contemplates suicide while being harassed by the neighborhood paper boy, freaked out by his well-meaning parents, and humiliated at every turn. He's so caught up in winning Beth back that he doesn't at first notice Monique (Diane Franklin), a French exchange student staying next door with some trying domestic problems of her own.This 1980s teen comedy unfortunately doesn't live up to the darkly comic promise of its title. Lane's flirtation with suicide is fleeting and accidental. His experiences are presented subjectively, not literally. We see what Lane imagines as well as what might actually be there. This sounds like a good set-up for absurdist humor, and Lane is an appealing character. But all other characters are one-dimensional caricatures whose roles in the story seem unlikely. They fall flat. Lane's rival Roy (Aaron Dozier) does nothing more than call him names. Granted, ""Better Off Dead"" is from Lane's point of view. But the humor is watered down and lacks the punch necessary to make good on its premise.

Cusack gives a great performance at what he knows best, being a teenager. For Lane Myer, being a teenager is the most surreal and  diverse experience one can go through. His life is full of things that you  wouldn't normally find: a ditsy mother who likes to experiment with all  types of food (from boiling bacon to cooking something that looks like an  octopus), a father who reads 70s slang manuals to try to relate to Lane,  and a younger brother who has a better time scoring chicks than Lane. Even  school is surreal for him. I mean, who is actually happy to be at school?  The movie also brings in some interesting twists, like drawings that talk  back to Lane, and fun sequence featuring an Eddie Van Halen hamburger  playing guitar. The film comes up with one of my favorite lines of all  time: When Lane is pushed off a bridge and into a garbage truck, he passes  two black tree trimmers and one of them says &quot;Now that's a shame when  folks throw away a perfectly good white boy like that&quot;. What I'm  trying to get at is, Lane looks at adolesence as we all did at one time or  another, as a very twilight zone-ish experience. We all tried to win  admiration and respect from peers, and then when we struck out, we would  see things as Lane did.

Let me tell you this movie will keep you smiling cause this movie is laughable.

His mom cooks sea creatures and other weird creatures for dinner. He gets a job at the burger-joint but his boss doesn't like him that much. He goes to the school dance and finds the beautiful french girl there who finds him very attractive and appreciates his well-being. So Lane should be a lucky guy to have her. So he should get over with Beth and just focus on someone who is more loyal to him than she.Oh and don't forget the lovely Elizabeth Daily who sung at the school dance with a lovely voice.

269520,A5UMUVEV1RUS9,6301802322,SuperJenn,"[0, 1]","Better Off Dead is one of my favorite 80's movies involving John Cusack. He plays Lane, who is obsessed with his girlfriend, Beth, and becoming part of the very esteemed ski team. But Lane's world is turned upside down during ski tryouts when the ski team captain steals his girl away and denies him a spot on the team. Lane keeps devising ways to kill himself that fortunately (and very comedically) never work out. Meanwhile, the dorky neighbor kid, Ricky & his overbearing mom take in a French foreign exchange student, Monique, and the mom uses this as an opportunity to try to bud a romance between the two. But Monique is anything but attracted to the hideous Ricky who won't keep his ""tentacles"" to himself. The only thing that saves Lane and Monique from the unpleasantness in their lives in the friendship the two soon form and the incredibly amusing moments that ensue in the midst of it.This movie is filled with some very hilarious moments...the Japanese guys who always try to race Lane on the streets (one of them learned to speak English by imitating Howard Cosell, sorry if I spelled that incorrectly), Lane's mom's cooking, Pig Burger and the unforgettable claymation burger singing Van Halen's ""Everybody Wants Some,"" and the dinner scene with Lane's family and Ricky's family are just a few of them.

Cusack plays Lane Meyer, an average guy who craves the limelight but is afraid to take a chance.  Dumped by the girlfriend Beth (Amanda Wyss) about whom he is obsessed (reference the view of his closet where every hanger displays a picture of Beth) after being cheated out of a spot on the school ski team by Ski Team Captain, Roy Stalin, (who also steals Beth), Lane sets about on a course of alternately trying to win her back and self destruction.  Along the way, he becomes acquainted with the French foreign exchange student, Monique, who is living with his creepy neighbor and pretending not to be able to speak English.  Monique helps Lane to believe in himself and in the end, Lane defeats Stalin in a ski race and wins the right girl, Monique.What makes this film so humorous are the side characters.  His father, superbly played by David Ogden Stiers (Charles Emerson Winchester III from ""MASH"" among many other great performances) who is trying to understand his son and relate to him by being hip, Lane's stoner friend, Charles De Mar, well played by Charles Armstrong, the psychotic paperboy, ""I want my two dollars!,"" the Japanese drag racers who either speak no English or speak like Howard Cosell, Ricky the creepy neighbor, and Badger (Lane's brother) who never speaks but sends away for guides like ""How to Meet Trashy Women"" and ""How to Build a Space Shuttle out of Household Items"" and somehow makes them work.  These are only a few of the side charactersI enjoy this film and find it to be humorous, although with an 80's feel.  Elizabeth Daily is hilarious (while not intentionally) as the singer at the dance trying to do the rocker strut.  My two favorite scenes are when Lane imagines himself making a Frankenburger to the tune of Van Halen's ""Everybody Wants Some,"" and when Lane, after deciding not to jump of a bridge, is knocked off by De Mar.  Lane lands in a garbage truck where two city workers trimming trees observe, ""Man, now thats a real shame when folks be throwing away a perfectly good white boy like that.""

The rest of it is an amalgamation of cliches from a dozen John Hughes  movies.When the protagonist wakes up to a room full of his girlfriends'  pictures you know that she's going to dump him shortly. When the French  exchange student who looks way better than his girlfriend moves next door,  you know that she's going to be his happy ending. When you see the  girlfriend and her new guy, you wonder why anyone would think this girl is  good enough to kill oneself over in the first place. The suicide attempts  aren't even that funny.The only reason why I am not giving this movie  one star is because John Cusack is enjoyable to watch regardless of what  kind of material he ends up with. It took Cameron Crowe to give him Lloyd  Dobler (sic?) and make him into a star. He's likeable enough as a loser  that you almost forgive him for making you watch the whole movie.For  other John Cusack movies watch High Fidelity, Say Anything, or Bullets Over  Broadway. For Suicide Comedies you can't beat Heathers. For 80s romance  movies even John Hughes is better, but you might want to also try Fast  Times at Ridgemont High. For good post-breakup therapy rent out either  Swingers or Strange Days (depending on what you feel towards your  ex-lover)The only reason why this movie is worth buying is the main  reason why I can't stand it. If you want to complete your collection of  John Cusack, suicide comedy, teen romance, eighties teen, or breakup movies  you should buy it.

However, I'm more than willing to make an exception in the case of ""Better Off Dead.""  No matter how many times I watch it, this movie just won't stop being funny.  It's a dead-on examination of high-school alienation and suburban depression, with a twisted sense of humor that separated it from overrated (in my opinion) '80's movies like ""Risky Business"" and ""The Breakfast Club.""In the role he was seemingly born to play, John Cusack performs the lead role of Lane Myer, a high school student driven to the brink of suicide after the girlfriend he's obsessed with dumps him for the more popular ski team captain.  Lane is essentially a human punching bag, with little indignities and embarassments piling up on him until his life becomes intolerable.  He has a weird passive-aggressive quality about him, suffering mainly in silence even as his frustrations mount and he tries to figure out a way to improve his lot.  To some viewers, Lane might seem like a baby who exaggerates his problems, but anyone with fresh memories of suffering through high school knows better.  Lane is such a relatable and enduring character precisely because during your teen years everything often seems like a matter of life and death.What really makes the movie, though, is the collection of screwball characters and director Savage Steve Holland's keen eye for inspired details.  ""Better Off Dead"" is filled with little bizarre elements that may not have much of anything to do with the plot, but they'll make you laugh.  Lane's little brother builds elaborate futuristic contraptions and studies (with great success) the art of picking up trashy women.  Lane's math class sits in rapt attention as their teacher explains a geometry problem.  An evil paperboy torments Lane for two dollars.  A cheerleader dates the entire basketball team.  Lane's weirdo mother serves a variety of ""French"" foods for a visiting French exchange student.  Every few minutes the film digresses for one of Lane's fantasy sequences, giving the plot a stream-of-consciousness quality that was way ahead of its time in mainstream cinema.Eventually Lane finds love and takes on his skiing rival in the movie's hilarious finale, but that's not really important.  What matters is what happens getting there.  I've seen few movies as creative or intelligent as this one, regardless of what decade they came out of.
