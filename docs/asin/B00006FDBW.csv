713275,AF1VHA7BVWLO1,B00006FDBW,Alexia Komaux,"[8, 11]","Right of the bat, this movie is not for everyone. It opens with an intertitle announcing nonchalantly, and I quote, ""Have you ever f*cked your father?"". Seeing this written simply on the screen, you start to look around the theater to try to ascertain other people's reaction. You feel slightly uncomfortable. You wonder if your presence at the movie is a testament of your perversity. As the scene progress and it becomes eminent that this little girl is indeed going to have sex with her father, you feel a genuine unease. You even wonder if other member of the audience will simply stand up and leave... but everyone remains seated. They watch the act play itself out. It looks so real!! Who in the world filmed this? Is this a movie or did it really happened?Then you realize that the reason nobody left, was that they were all glued in their seat. Frozen. The scene was so intense! And then... the laughter starts. An unsure, reluctant laugh. Should I laugh? Is this funny? Is this sick? Distasteful? Sad? The answer is: this is human nature. Some of us do this. Some never do, but nonetheless have the urge to do some of these things. We are not all as neat, conformist, lawful, respectful, righteous as some might think. We have a dark side. This film shows us this dark side. Simply, honestly, and with great care not to be afraid to go too far.This film is extremely daring. It depicts acts that are not only illegal and to most (I sincerely hope) immoral, but that are also very passionate and intimately linked to who we are. Seeing this on screen allows us a glimpse into this forbidden world. It is as though we are actually committing these atrocities vicariously, and if not, are at least silent witnesses. But we enjoy it. Yes, why do we enjoy it so much? Because, like it or not, it is part of us, somewhere deep (very deep) inside, we understand these fellow humans.So behind the shock value and the constant disturbing images thrown at the spectators, there lies a deep analysis of human drives that is quite revealing and to the point. This film is like a case study in a scientific experiment. Between the sex, between the violence, we find the motivations and reasons for this decadence. For some it may require more courage than others, but we owe it to ourselves to watch... to learn.This film is not as dark as you might imagine it to be. That is what is so surprising about it. The incorporation of humor and absurdity in hateful and abject displays. The situations are in fact quite funny, even hilarious. The people are real persons that you might even come to like. The story is somewhat sweet, heartfelt. So come in open-minded, let go of your inhibitions, of your own self-censorship, and enjoy it!! Laugh, cry, let your stomach turn a little and feel like you've experienced something never before experienced. This is what novelty is all about.The first scene is just the tip of the iceberg compared to the rest of the movie, but I would spoil the fun by telling you what you are about to see, just go ahead and see it. Expect nothing. Expect anything.",5,Putting the fun back in dysfunctional!,1154822400,"08 6, 2006",2006,3085,"['Right', 'bat', 'movie', 'not', 'everyone', 'intertitle', 'announcing', 'nonchalantly', 'quote', 'Have', 'ever', 'f*cked', 'father', 'Seeing', 'written', 'simply', 'screen', 'start', 'look', 'theater', 'try', 'ascertain', 'other', 'people', 'reaction', 'feel', 'slightly', 'uncomfortable', 'wonder', 'presence', 'movie', 'testament', 'perversity', 'scene', 'progress', 'eminent', 'little', 'girl', 'indeed', 'going', 'have', 'sex', 'father', 'feel', 'genuine', 'unease', 'even', 'wonder', 'other', 'member', 'audience', 'will', 'simply', 'stand', 'up', 'leave', 'everyone', 'seated', 'watch', 'act', 'play', 'out', 'so', 'real', 'Who', 'world', 'filmed', 'movie', 'did', 'really', 'happened', 'Then', 'realize', 'reason', 'nobody', 'left', 'was', 'were', 'glued', 'seat', 'Frozen', 'scene', 'was', 'so', 'intense', 'then', 'laughter', 'unsure', 'reluctant', 'laugh', 'Should', 'laugh', 'funny', 'sick', 'Distasteful', 'Sad', 'answer', 'human', 'nature', 'do', 'never', 'do', 'nonetheless', 'have', 'urge', 'do', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'all', 'neat', 'conformist', 'lawful', 'respectful', 'righteous', 'might', 'think', 'have', 'dark', 'side', 'film', 'dark', 'side', 'Simply', 'honestly', 'great', 'care', 'not', 'be', 'afraid', 'go', 'too', 'far.This', 'film', 'extremely', 'daring', 'acts', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'illegal', 'most', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'immoral', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'passionate', 'intimately', 'linked', 'who', 'are', 'Seeing', 'screen', 'glimpse', 'forbidden', 'world', 'are', 'actually', 'committing', 'atrocities', 'vicariously', 'not', 'are', 'least', 'silent', 'witnesses', 'enjoy', 'Yes', 'why', 'do', 'enjoy', 'so', 'much', 'not', 'part', 'somewhere', 'deep', 'very', 'deep', 'inside', 'understand', 'fellow', 'humans.So', 'shock', 'value', 'constant', 'disturbing', 'images', 'thrown', 'spectators', 'deep', 'analysis', 'human', 'drives', 'quite', 'revealing', 'point', 'film', 'case', 'study', 'scientific', 'experiment', 'sex', 'violence', 'find', 'motivations', 'reasons', 'decadence', 'may', 'require', 'more', 'courage', 'others', 'owe', 'ourselves', 'watch', 'learn.This', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'dark', 'might', 'imagine', 'be', 'what', 'so', 'surprising', 'incorporation', 'humor', 'absurdity', 'hateful', 'abject', 'displays', 'situations', 'are', 'fact', 'quite', 'funny', 'even', 'hilarious', 'people', 'are', 'real', 'persons', 'might', 'even', 'come', 'like', 'story', 'somewhat', 'sweet', 'heartfelt', 'So', 'come', 'open-minded', 'let', 'go', 'inhibitions', 'own', 'self-censorship', 'enjoy', 'Laugh', 'cry', 'let', 'stomach', 'turn', 'little', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'experienced', 'something', 'never', 'before', 'experienced', 'what', 'novelty', 'about.The', 'first', 'scene', 'just', 'tip', 'iceberg', 'compared', 'rest', 'movie', 'would', 'spoil', 'fun', 'telling', 'what', 'are', 'see', 'just', 'go', 'ahead', 'see', 'Expect', 'nothing', 'Expect', 'anything']",N/A
713276,A1VDRK69F22YMN,B00006FDBW,Anticlimacus,"[6, 12]","Spoiler Warning.Takashi Miike is a director that is more thoughtful than most critics would like to believe. The reason for this is his use of violence and sexual content that for some viewers draws attention away from the underlying themes that permeate his filmography. There's no denying that, for example, ""Ichi the Killer"" (2001) has good scriptwriting and interesting characters, but at times it seems like viewers will completely ignore those elements. What results is a weird kind of false dichotomy where fans will like the film due to its ""cool"" violence and detractors will dislike the film for its ""shallowness."" Both reactions seem a bit short-sighted in my eyes. I highly recommend Tom Mes's book entitled ""Agitator"", which is an excellent resource that describes and summarizes all of the fascinating content in Miike's films.Most ironically, ""Visitor Q"" is in a situation that is the exact opposite of ""Ichi the Killer"" because this movie has poor scriptwriting and wafer thin characters, yet has received much praise for its ""insightful commentary on family dynamics"" or whatever. I'm not buying it, at all. If we look closely we recognize that Miike stoops to repeatedly using contrived solutions to get characters from Point A (family dysfunction) to Point B (family function) without ever bothering to establish a convincing development of their relationships with each other. What results is a thoughtless film that portrays a sense of faux intelligence by using a few uber-simplistic symbols.Let's take a look at some of the family members to see just how lazily Miike utilizes his contrived plot device: Visitor Q.DAUGHTER: An easy place to start, because there's virtually no development of her character whatsoever. She's likely a prostitute due to the general dysfunction of the family, but how does she break free from her current existence and re-enter the family dynamic? Visitor Q hits her in the head with a slab of concrete (off screen). I really can't think of a lazier, more contrived way of getting a character from Point A to Point B. Taking into consideration the fact that this artificial ""solution"" is invoked during the last five minutes only adds more evidence that Miike just wanted to finish the film.MOTHER and SON: I group these two together because both are connected by an uber-simplistic symbol: breast milk. Yes Miike, I understand your use of breast milk as a representation of maternal instinct, and it is slightly clever - but only slightly. The son is bullied by his peers and takes it out on his mother by beating her. She takes the beating without putting up a fight because - well - we never know. In any case, the son really beats the stuffing out of here, abusing her on a nightly basis. What could possibly be the solution to this grim situation? Easy, Visitor Q milks her breasts! You see, once her nipples start spilling milk she becomes at one with her maternal instinct. Her son later bathes in the milk and he becomes at one with his instincts as a child. Their relationship is returned to a healthy one. Like I said, slightly clever, but Miike is unfortunately content with keeping this theme in an undeveloped embryonic state throughout this 84-minute film. He just milks it to death.FATHER: Although the daughter is the shallowest character, the father is easily the most muddled and poorly written. To be frank, the scriptwriting behind his actions is a complete mess. This is evident when reading the ""Visitor Q"" chapter in Tom Mes's aforementioned book. Usually Mes is very convincing in his analysis, but in this case it's obvious that he's reaching desperately to find some kind of logic behind this character's actions. He's apparently a bad father because of some kind of sexual impotence that prevents him from confidently taking his role in the family, but he has no problems banging his daughter at the beginning of the film so that angle makes no sense. Mes posits that his lustful desire for the corpse near the end of the film is the breakthrough moment (again referencing impotence), but it's a seemingly random revelation that has absolutely nothing to do with his role as a father or husband. How does having sex with a corpse change his relationship with his living wife? It makes no freakin' sense.The contrived nature of this film is also inadvertently pointed out by Mes when talking about the previous scene where the father watches his son get bullied with his colleague (a reference to his failure as a businessman). The father seems to have a real desire to have someone interject and save his son, which is different from previous scenes. Why does he feel this way? Well, because Visitor Q is holding the camcorder this time around. My friends, it doesn't get much more contrived than that.In a general sense I can appreciate the premise of portraying family values using themes that are typically considered exploitative (e.g., necrophelia, incest, etc.), but merely stitching these things together with contrived solutions doesn't qualify as quality filmmaking. Some might choose to defend the artificiality of this movie by stating that it's an intentional device used to provoke laughter, but if that's the case then the assertion of ""insightful commentary on family dynamics"" is thrown right out the window.If you want an effective blend of controversial sexual themes and dramatic elements, check out ""Antenna"" (2004), ""Ichi the Killer"" (2001), ""Strange Circus"" (2005), or ""Moonlight Whispers"" (1999). If you want good movies about dysfunctional families, check out ""Tokyo Sonata"" (2008), ""Funuke Show Me Some Love, You Losers"" (2007), ""Rendan"" (2001), or ""Harmful Insect"" (2001).",1,A

It's absurd as life itself, it's about modern family and loneliness. Well, maybe if Todd Solondz were japanese he'd made such a film.So it's not that bad - everyone will find something to his own taste, but also not that good - ""Irreversible"" or ""Audition"" are more gross and there are movies that are far more metaphysical.Proceed at your own risk.",3,WELL...

713278,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,B00006FDBW,"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[13, 18]","This 2001 film by Takashi Miike has to count as one of the most disturbing film's I have ever seen. I have seen my share and yet this film still made me wince and turn away from the screen a few times. Takashi Miike has been called the Japanese Quentin Tarantino, but that is an understatement. Miike would've shown in full-glory Mr. Blonde cutting off that tied-up cop's ear. Not just show it but do it up close and replay it in slow-motion. Miike would've shown exactly what was going on behind Marcel Wallace and how he and his homies got medieval on those Klan rednecks. Miike doesn't pull any punches and adds in a kick and a stab and twists the knife just to be sure.Visitor Q (Bizita Q in Japan) is Miike's take on the nature of violence and sex that has permeated the media with a nod towards reality TV. His film is especially revelant since it was filmed and first shown in Japan. A nation and culture that blames the West for its decadence and immorality when at the same time its entertainment industry churns out anime, manga and films that put Western entertainment to shame, i.e. tentacles and more tentacles.The plot is simple and straightforward. A failed former TV reporter tries to provide for his family by filming a documentary concerning the effects of violence and sex on the youth of today. The rest of the film from there ends up showing this father's dysfunctional family involved in heavy drug abuse, their indifference to violence around them, incest, necrophilia, and a few other things I don't even know the name for.Bizita Q is a film that Marquis De Sade would have trouble sitting through. But despite the disturbing images and sequences in this film, Miike does make a good point about the subject of sex and violence in the media and its effect on youth and just people in general. After awhile, those I was watching the film with stopped turning their face from the screen and began watching the film without flinching. This is a film that is definitely not for everybody, but if you are brave enough and have the stomach for it, Miike's film is a good study in gross excess and surrealism in film. He straddles between fine art and extreme exploitation, and after the first few minutes falls on the latter, revels and doesn't apologize.",4,"Disturbing, surreal, exploitive and only for the daring.",1091491200,"08 3, 2004",2004,2273,"['2001', 'film', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'count', 'one', 'most', 'disturbing', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'have', 'seen', 'share', 'yet', 'film', 'still', 'made', 'wince', 'turn', 'away', 'screen', 'few', 'times', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'been', 'called', 'Japanese', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'understatement', 'Miike', 'would', ""'ve"", 'shown', 'full-glory', 'Mr.', 'Blonde', 'cutting', 'off', 'tied-up', 'cop', 'ear', 'Not', 'just', 'show', 'do', 'up', 'close', 'replay', 'slow-motion', 'Miike', 'would', ""'ve"", 'shown', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Marcel', 'Wallace', 'how', 'homies', 'got', 'medieval', 'Klan', 'rednecks', 'Miike', ""n't"", 'pull', 'punches', 'kick', 'stab', 'knife', 'just', 'be', 'sure.Visitor', 'Q', 'Bizita', 'Q', 'Japan', 'Miike', 'take', 'nature', 'violence', 'sex', 'permeated', 'media', 'nod', 'reality', 'TV', 'film', 'especially', 'revelant', 'was', 'filmed', 'first', 'shown', 'Japan', 'nation', 'culture', 'West', 'decadence', 'immorality', 'when', 'same', 'time', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'out', 'anime', 'manga', 'films', 'put', 'Western', 'entertainment', 'shame', 'i.e', 'tentacles', 'more', 'tentacles.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'failed', 'former', 'TV', 'reporter', 'tries', 'provide', 'family', 'filming', 'documentary', 'concerning', 'effects', 'violence', 'sex', 'youth', 'today', 'rest', 'film', 'up', 'showing', 'father', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'involved', 'heavy', 'drug', 'abuse', 'indifference', 'violence', 'incest', 'few', 'other', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'name', 'for.Bizita', 'Q', 'film', 'Marquis', 'De', 'Sade', 'would', 'have', 'trouble', 'sitting', 'disturbing', 'images', 'sequences', 'film', 'Miike', 'make', 'good', 'point', 'subject', 'sex', 'violence', 'media', 'effect', 'youth', 'just', 'people', 'general', 'awhile', 'was', 'watching', 'film', 'stopped', 'turning', 'face', 'screen', 'began', 'watching', 'film', 'flinching', 'film', 'definitely', 'not', 'everybody', 'are', 'brave', 'enough', 'have', 'stomach', 'Miike', 'film', 'good', 'study', 'gross', 'excess', 'surrealism', 'film', 'fine', 'art', 'extreme', 'exploitation', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'falls', 'latter', 'revels', ""n't"", 'apologize']",N/A

713281,A1ARQYFYXAL4I,B00006FDBW,bonsai chicken,"[21, 32]","One of the more bizarre films I've ever seen, Takashi Miike's VISITOR Q is about a family that is as dysfunctional as can be.  The daughter is a prostitute whose clientele sometimes includes her own ineffectual father, a failed news reporter.  The son, who is beat up and tormented daily by school bullies, takes his anger out on his mother by beating her with a cane for any kind of minor infraction.  The mother prostitutes herself as well in order to pay for her heroin addiction.  (One almost can't blame her for seeking this kind of escape.)Enter the unnamed visitor of the title.  After bashing the father in the head with a large rock, he insinuates himself into the household.  And then things get weirder.I couldn't make heads or tails of this film.  I'm sure it's some kind of commentary on the family unit in modern society, but I'm damned if I can tell what it's saying.  On display you'll find incest, necrophilia, copious lactation (and urination), domestic violence, dismemberment, and other things I'd rather not mention here.  Yet it fails to be disturbing simply because it is so outrageous.  Occasionally it is amusing, but more often it's rather boring.I loved Miike's AUDITION, probably his most serious and artistic film, but I can't recommend this one as anything other than a curiosity item.  It's worth picking up just to see some things that you're unlikely to see anywhere else, but don't expect anything coherent.The DVD contains a biography of the director and ""liner notes"" (useful for those renting.)  There are also a few trailers which you must sit through to watch the film.  If you try to escape to the main menu the disc will stop playing entirely.

If you've never seen a Takashi Miike film, then prepare yourself to be shocked and to see things you've never seen in a movie before. Visitor Q focuses around the Yamazaki family. Kiyoshi, the father, used to be a television broadcaster and is trying to come up with ideas for a new reality television show. Keiko, the mother, is verbally and physically abused by her son. She and Kiyoshi pretty much allow it to happen, but her only rule is that her son doesn't mess up her face. Takuya, the son, is picked on by bullies even while he's at home. A visitor shows up at the house after hitting Kiyoshi over the head with a rock...twice. Their lives get even more screwed up as he shows up and it's all caught on camera.If you watch this movie, you might as well know what you're getting yourself into. This movie not only contains ""strong aberrant sexual and violent content, language and drug use"" as stated by the MPAA when giving the movie an R rating, but it also contains incest, necrophilia, and just things that people will find disturbing in general. Like a woman lactating from her nipples and having it squirt all over the place. I'm just trying to give you fair warning just in case you're thinking about watching a movie that you won't be able to finish. It's not for everybody and just know that you're in for a wild ride.That's not to say that the movie isn't enjoyable though. Even though it deals with a lot of disturbing material, there's some comedy in there. The fact that the visitor(he never really says what his name is) bashes people over the head with a rock just because he can is kind of hilarious. To tell the truth, it kept me watching because this family was so messed up. And the way Kiyoshi lost his broadcasting job will be remembered...forever.Takashi Miike is known quite well in the horror community for pushing the envelope in movies like Ichi the Killer and Imprint, so horror fans know that if they know they're watching a movie done by Miike that they're going to see some material they won't see anywhere else. Casual movie fans may not be interested in shock value or movies that are this disturbing. Visitor Q not only pushes the envelope, it pays for postage and insurance as well.The bottom line is that if you want to be grossed out or have a bunch of ""what the @#$%?!"" moments, rent Visitor Q or any Takashi Miike film for that matter.Rating: 6/10",3,So Disturbing You Have To Watch,1207094400,"04 2, 2008",2008,2449,"['Visitor', 'Q', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'take', 'reality', 'television', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'film', 'then', 'prepare', 'be', 'shocked', 'see', 'things', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'Visitor', 'Q', 'Yamazaki', 'family', 'Kiyoshi', 'father', 'used', 'be', 'television', 'broadcaster', 'trying', 'come', 'up', 'ideas', 'new', 'reality', 'television', 'show', 'Keiko', 'mother', 'verbally', 'physically', 'abused', 'son', 'Kiyoshi', 'pretty', 'much', 'allow', 'happen', 'only', 'rule', 'son', ""n't"", 'mess', 'up', 'face', 'Takuya', 'son', 'picked', 'bullies', 'even', 'home', 'visitor', 'up', 'house', 'hitting', 'Kiyoshi', 'head', 'rock', 'twice', 'lives', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'screwed', 'up', 'up', 'caught', 'camera.If', 'watch', 'movie', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'strong', 'aberrant', 'sexual', 'violent', 'content', 'language', 'drug', 'use', 'stated', 'MPAA', 'when', 'giving', 'movie', 'R', 'rating', 'also', 'incest', 'necrophilia', 'just', 'things', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'disturbing', 'general', 'woman', 'lactating', 'nipples', 'having', 'place', ""'m"", 'just', 'trying', 'give', 'fair', 'warning', 'just', 'case', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'watching', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'finish', 'not', 'everybody', 'just', 'know', ""'re"", 'wild', 'ride.That', 'not', 'say', 'movie', ""n't"", 'enjoyable', 'Even', 'lot', 'disturbing', 'material', 'comedy', 'there', 'fact', 'visitor', 'never', 'really', 'what', 'name', 'bashes', 'people', 'head', 'rock', 'just', 'can', 'kind', 'hilarious', 'tell', 'truth', 'kept', 'watching', 'family', 'was', 'so', 'messed', 'up', 'way', 'Kiyoshi', 'lost', 'broadcasting', 'job', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'forever.Takashi', 'Miike', 'known', 'quite', 'well', 'horror', 'community', 'pushing', 'envelope', 'movies', 'Ichi', 'Killer', 'Imprint', 'so', 'horror', 'fans', 'know', 'know', ""'re"", 'watching', 'movie', 'done', 'Miike', ""'re"", 'going', 'see', 'material', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'anywhere', 'else', 'Casual', 'movie', 'fans', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'interested', 'shock', 'value', 'movies', 'are', 'disturbing', 'Visitor', 'Q', 'not', 'only', 'envelope', 'postage', 'insurance', 'well.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'want', 'be', 'grossed', 'out', 'have', 'bunch', 'what', '@', '%', 'moments', 'rent', 'Visitor', 'Q', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'film', 'matter.Rating', '6/10']",N/A

Diverse influences are apparent here, from Bunuel (his delight in mocking bourgeois values) to Kubrick (static shots, symmetrical compositions) to absurdist and surrealist film in general.  Miike presents us with a family that gives new meaning to the word ""dysfunctional.""  The father is a TV reporter so desperate for sensational topics to tackle that he videotapes himself having sex with his prostitute daughter.  He placidly eats his supper while his teenage son whips and beats the mother, who also works as a prostitute in order to support her heroin habit. One day the father brings home a mysterious guest (the titular Visitor, although his name is never given) who casually exerts an almost godlike power over the family, bringing them together in a most unexpected manner. The film is very funny at times, sometimes in an almost slapstick way, sometimes in a VERY dark, twisted way. There's plenty of room for debate.  Who or what is Visitor Q?

With a son beating his mother relentlessly for the first half of the movie.)  I stopped for years watching any live action Japanese film besides the occasional Samurai film I avoided them like the plague.I wasn't even able to finish Visitor Q, stopping it half way through.  But of last night I decided to watch it again to see why it freaked me out so much.  And it still freaked me out honestly, but I kept going with it and let the movie play out, finally after the half way mark of this film it turned around and became a amazing, yet odd family film.  Leaving me with the amazing warm feeling of love, that blow me away, when my first reaction to this film was to run and never turn back.The film starts off harsh and doesn't relent until after the half way mark but until then the characters never try to reclaim their lives, as they are in the beginning they're all just people lost in their own lives and torture.  The mother being a heroin addict, the son beating his own mother after every day being beaten up by the kids at school, and they're father being laughed at by everyone because he can't last long when he goes to bed with someone.Then they start to find them selves, some of this comes from violence, extreme sexuality, and some of it come from finding the mother in side them, that they are more then a piece of meat.  Through this the family bonds and becomes a whole family under a strong mother a father.  They learn to grow up as well as know when they need to be a child.This film is amazing, harsh and brutal to watch, I did stop watching Japanese film for 5 year because of this film and other film by Takashi Miike.

713298,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00006FDBW,Jeffrey Leach,"[108, 119]","After viewing &quot;Audition&quot; and &quot;Ichi the Killer,&quot; I doubted whether Japanese director Takashi Miike could shock me again. Boy, was I wrong! If you thought the piano wire scene in &quot;Audition&quot; went far beyond the pale, or the hot oil bath in &quot;Ichi the Killer&quot; left you speechless--as it did me--prepare yourself for the new nightmare that is &quot;Visitor Q.&quot; The scenes in this film about a twisted Japanese family would make the Marquis de Sade leave the room in disgust. I have no idea what Miike was thinking when he made this film, but remember this one little fact--&quot;Visitor Q&quot; is a made for television movie. That's right, after viewing this movie remind yourself that this obscenity aired on Japanese television within the last couple of years. We Americans cannot put forth any prime time fodder that could even remotely compare to this atrocity, unless you count something like &quot;Teletubbies.&quot; Thank goodness we still have a few qualms. As much as I distrust censorship of any type, I am definitely not ready to see something like &quot;Visitor Q&quot; on network television on this side of the pond.&quot;Visitor Q&quot; takes a penetrating look at your typical Japanese middle class family, Miike style. The father of this bizarre clan works as a reality television host who is always willing to go so far over the line in his broadcasts that his fellow workers shun the his very presence. The daughter of the family no longer lives at home since she is too busy putting in a full schedule at a brothel somewhere in town. The young son in this creepy household spends his days meekly submitting to a trio of bullies who beat him up after school. The mother is a real winner, a heroin addict and prostitute who allows her abused son to beat her with wicker canes. The mother and father fail to communicate on any substantive level. The son's problems with the bullies goes unheeded by the family, except when the father decides to fashion a new reality program centering on his child's beatings. The relationship between the father and his daughter is best left unelaborated on here; it is sufficient to say it is one of the most warped father/daughter connections in film history. Yes, this family suffers a host of psychological problems that would give a Sigmund Freud a coronary.All of these people are sick to the core of their souls, a problem that is about to undergo a radical change with the introduction of a complete stranger into the household. This anonymous (we never learn his name), scruffy looking youth first makes an appearance on the scene when he hits the father of the family on the head with a rock--twice. For some mysterious reason, dad brings this guy home with him for dinner. As time goes by, we see this chap increasingly integrate himself into the daily lives of the family. He sets his sights on the mother at first, rekindling a sense of motherhood in the woman in yet another unmentionable scene (there are a lot of unmentionable events in this movie). The interaction between the stranger and the mother is the most dramatic in the film, but eventually the father, son, and even daughter all fall under the spell of this enigmatic visitor. The end result of these odd encounters is a type of peculiar healing, where the family abandons their insane behavior and returns to a sense of normalcy. Obviously, &quot;Visitor Q&quot; is a Miike film, so the healing takes some really stomach churning turns along the way. After all, there is nothing like dismemberment and a host of other depravities to turn a family around!There has been some effort to emphasize the reality television elements of the film, but &quot;Visitor Q&quot; has little to do with this theme. There are only a few scenes that even deal with this element, specifically the first taboo shattering images between the father and daughter and a couple of other short bits later in the movie. What is really going on here has to do with the Japanese family and how it deals with the pressures of modern life in an industrialized society. Miike likes to shock with his films, and his target audience must surely have expressed such an emotion when they saw his take on a traditional Japanese family plagued with so many obnoxious psychopathologies. As weird as it sounds, I firmly believe &quot;Visitor Q&quot; is actually an extremely conservative film. Even as the director breaks the bounds of good taste, he seems to possess an earnest belief in the overriding importance of the healthy family unit. You could easily make the argument that images of the type indulged in by Miike have led to the breakdown of the family, and it would be an effective argument, but this movie does contain a strong pro-family theme.&quot;Visitor Q&quot; runs for about eighty four minutes, short compared to the other two Miike films I have seen. The picture quality is excellent. Extras on the DVD include four trailers--&quot;Visitor Q,&quot; &quot;Samurai Fiction,&quot; &quot;Fudoh,&quot; and &quot;Freeze Me&quot;--some liner notes about Miike's films and a short biography about the director. Once again, Media Blasters has released another soul shattering movie to DVD. The disc I watched had a technical problem, though: whenever I hit the menu button on my remote control the picture went gray and I had to start the disc over again. Perhaps this flaw appeared only on my copy of the movie, but it's something to think about before purchasing if it is a widespread glitch. I look forward to watching more Miike mayhem in the near future. If you would like to examine this director's queasy visions, &quot;Visitor Q&quot; is the ideal starting place before moving on to the more complex &quot;Audition.&quot;",4,Mother's milk heals all

713299,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B00006FDBW,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[3, 4]","""Visitor Q"" is an extraordinary film. At first I was worried by the use of cinematography because it looked cheap and crappy to me but then I noticed the angles that the director was employing and his abundant technique. Of all Miike's flicks this one ought to be among the most weirdest, psychological ones. I guess the main topic would be: what are we supposed to feel. And that's what Miike succeeds to evoke in us, the viewers. I really find myself having a hard time finding the words to describe what I've just seen and experienced.  I find this film somehow to be beautiful in a disturbed way.I had to avert my eyes at points. I have never liked needles. MIIKE seems to love them. The use of the hypodermic syringe was used brilliantly in his film ""Audition"". A classic of modern Cinema in my opinion. The creativity in ""Visitor Q"" is boundless, slightly sick, I grant you, yet assured and beautifully acted. This is a strong film. The ideas are warped and the execution is masterful. As the story advances in this movie various taboos come to life (the shock factor), the way things are presented is a little humorous. If you are pretty open-minded and don't take things to seriously you are going to start laughing at some of the situations that transpires in this movie.Takashi Miike is a very talented filmmaker. He bears his soul with a project like ""Visitor Q"" and that is rare and brave. I mentioned acting earlier and find myself asking, ""How far did these actors go?"" History has shown that the first actors were prostitutes. I sometimes wonder at the actors that walk the red carpet and ask, ""What has changed?"" Actors will do anything a director asks. This cast must have had great faith in their Director and great trust. The acting is faultless. At one point I did make the comparison with another great film ""Man Bites Dog"" because I found my self-laughing at situations so real and horrifying. That feeling is strange and I'm not sure I like it.Unexpected situations give birth to even more unexpected results during all movies and I cannot criticize this film in anyway. You probably might fine the cinematography a little bit amateurish as I did but the imagination overcomes any limitation when it comes to ""Visitor Q"". If you decide to watch/purchase this film take caution about the level of disturbance that's being exposed here with all the violence, gore, necrophilia, and kinkiness laid out to you.",4,Who are some of these actors?,1176940800,"04 19, 2007",2007,2429,"['Visitor', 'Q', 'extraordinary', 'film', 'first', 'was', 'worried', 'use', 'cinematography', 'looked', 'cheap', 'crappy', 'then', 'noticed', 'angles', 'director', 'was', 'employing', 'abundant', 'technique', 'Miike', 'flicks', 'one', 'ought', 'be', 'most', 'weirdest', 'psychological', 'ones', 'guess', 'main', 'topic', 'would', 'be', 'what', 'are', 'supposed', 'feel', 'what', 'Miike', 'evoke', 'viewers', 'really', 'find', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'finding', 'words', 'describe', 'what', ""'ve"", 'just', 'seen', 'experienced', 'find', 'film', 'somehow', 'be', 'beautiful', 'disturbed', 'way.I', 'had', 'avert', 'eyes', 'points', 'have', 'never', 'liked', 'needles', 'MIIKE', 'love', 'use', 'hypodermic', 'syringe', 'was', 'used', 'brilliantly', 'film', 'Audition', 'classic', 'modern', 'Cinema', 'opinion', 'creativity', 'Visitor', 'Q', 'boundless', 'slightly', 'sick', 'grant', 'yet', 'assured', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'strong', 'film', 'ideas', 'are', 'warped', 'execution', 'masterful', 'story', 'advances', 'movie', 'various', 'taboos', 'come', 'life', 'shock', 'factor', 'way', 'things', 'are', 'presented', 'little', 'humorous', 'are', 'pretty', 'open-minded', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'things', 'seriously', 'are', 'going', 'start', 'laughing', 'situations', 'movie.Takashi', 'Miike', 'very', 'talented', 'filmmaker', 'soul', 'project', 'Visitor', 'Q', 'rare', 'brave', 'mentioned', 'acting', 'earlier', 'find', 'asking', 'How', 'far', 'did', 'actors', 'go', 'History', 'shown', 'first', 'actors', 'were', 'prostitutes', 'sometimes', 'wonder', 'actors', 'walk', 'red', 'carpet', 'ask', 'What', 'changed', 'Actors', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'director', 'cast', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'great', 'faith', 'Director', 'great', 'trust', 'acting', 'faultless', 'one', 'point', 'did', 'make', 'comparison', 'great', 'film', 'Man', 'Dog', 'found', 'self-laughing', 'situations', 'so', 'real', 'horrifying', 'feeling', 'strange', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'like', 'it.Unexpected', 'situations', 'give', 'birth', 'even', 'more', 'unexpected', 'results', 'movies', 'can', 'not', 'criticize', 'film', 'anyway', 'probably', 'might', 'fine', 'cinematography', 'little', 'bit', 'amateurish', 'did', 'imagination', 'limitation', 'when', 'Visitor', 'Q', 'decide', 'watch/purchase', 'film', 'take', 'caution', 'level', 'disturbance', 'being', 'exposed', 'here', 'violence', 'gore', 'kinkiness', 'laid', 'out']",N/A

Takashi Miike does an excellent job in his movie critique about the loss of family life in a very [awkward] way. 4 characters, 4 different lifes tied together by the presence of the misterious Visitor Q, the last hope and tiny bit of conscience that gently follows each one of them and hits them in the head (literally) screaming to make them open their eyes and look at what they have become. This sounds kind of a corny moral lesson, but wait till you see the esence of Miikes metaphors and analogies: breast feeding grown ups, mother abuse, heroin addiction, incest, necrophilya, more violence and defecation with rigor mortis included, just wait and see. This movie is so good, the ending almost made me cry. Sounds really weird? just chek it out.

But instead of a time machine, this family is aided by some weirdo (visitor Q).Father disgraced himself as a TV news reporter when he offered himself up as the victim in his own news piece.  Now he's so disconnected from reality that he doesn't even know how to feel about what goes on around him.  When he sees his son being bullied he is inspired to produce a comeback news segment.  When he tries to explain his plans, he describes his own presence in the segment as if he would be acting a role.  He wants to give TV audiences what they expect and crave.  He means well, but he's demented.Daughter left home and works as a prostitute.  Mother tries to dutifully play her role in the family, but she has no protection from her bullied, embittered son who beats her.Fortunately a visitor arrives to show them that they don't have to accept their socially prescribed roles as disgraced misfits.  Mother can once again be a competent problem solver.  Son can stop worrying about those bullies.  Dad can be a leader of his family.

713303,A2T4TEYA7QQLMG,B00006FDBW,"Kgar ""Kgar_Fiction""","[10, 13]","The plot is a simple family drama. The father feels like a failure. The daughter is a depressed runaway. The younger brother is bullied and resents his family for not caring. The mother (the center of the family, and the one with the power to bring them all together) feels empty and unloved. A mysterious young man follows the father home one day and silently observes the family throughout their misadventures. He is the catalyst for change. He is Visitor Q.In reading the reviews of Visitor Q there seems to be two camps; those that like the movie and love this ""sick"" family, and those that don't like it because they don't get it. I'm suprised that both points of view seem to be taking this movie at face value. The way I see it, the ""twisted"" acts portrayed in the movie are not real, but are actually exaggerated metapors of what the characters feel and struggle with.In one scene, the younger brother who is constantly bullied (again, in a manner that is over the top and ""unreal""), is having dinner with the rest of the family. The bullies are outside the house yelling and screaming at him. Eventually they launch fireworks into the house and almost set the place a blaze. The family just sits there nonchalantly eating and passing around food. This is not real. It is a metaphor showing how the family is unconcerned with the brother's struggle with the bullies.The interesting thing (and I think the root of all the confusion) is the way Miike shot this film. It's shot digital with lots of handheld shots, giving it a shockingly objective, almost documentary feel. I think this causes viewers to accept what they see, and either laugh or turn away in disgust, instead of breaking it down in order to find the real meaning. In other words, the family is real, the emotions are real, the drama is real, the extreme acts are metaphors.So then why does this movie contain drug use, necrophilia, incest, prostitution, violence and a couple of murders? And why are these things treated nonchalantly by seemingly normal, middle class people? Well like I said I believe they are metaphors, but I also think Miike is making a cultural statement. In a time of so much cynicism, desensitization, and commercial sex and violence, basic family values can and must be held sacred.There are some disturbing scenes in this movie. There are some wacky humerous scenes aswell. Despite all of this, Miike has somehow made a truly heartfelt movie about the importance of family. You want this family to work. You want to see them smile.

713306,A3G602Z4DWDZKS,B00006FDBW,Matthew King,"[8, 10]","When the outside world fails us, whether it's dealing with a crap job day after day or a love life that goes nowhere or rejection in various forms we often turn to our family.  For many of us the family is a safety nest, a sanctuary of saneness where we can escape the pressures of every day life.  That's why films dealing with the disintegration of the family unit have been so shocking and unfathomable to me.  What happens when even our family nest is destroyed and all that we thought was dear is shattered to pieces?  I have seen some pretty disturbing cinematic examples in the past, most notably ""Cutting Moments"" and ""Combat Shock"" that had me asking the question what if, could this ever happen to me and my family?  Takashi Miike takes the concept of family dysfunction to new extremes with Visitor Q.Visitor Q examines a Japanese family with more problems than you could shake a stick at.  The movie opens up with a young prostitute and a middle-aged man engaging in intercourse in front of a home-video camera.  Throughout the act, the man keeps expressing remorse and doubt about what he is doing.  Remorse for what, cheating on his wife? Nope, turns out the prostitute is actually his daughter.  After this disturbing act that lasts not long, the lady taunts her own father with cries of ""early bird!"" and charges him 100 000Yen for the act, way more then he can afford.  No problem, the girl says just give the rest of the sum to mom once you have it.  Incest is the first of many atrocious acts committed by this family.  Throughout the course of the movie the viewer is submitted to various scenes of necrophilia and domestic violence.  Most bizarre is the young teenaged boy who continuously whips and beats up his mom, a crack addict and herself a prostitute.  Mom doesn't seem to mind too much though and even encourages the boy to beat her up even harder as long as it's not on her face.Visitor Q has a cheap Snuff-film kind of look to it and I wouldn't be surprised if Miike had filmed this with an 8mm camera, it certainly looks that way.  If Miike's sole intent with Visitor Q was to shock the viewer with as many outlandish images as possible than this can be considered a success.  However, I found this film to be quite lacking on an emotional level.  The family and their disturbing actions are presented in such a hollow way that the viewer doesn't even feel any sympathy towards them.  The family members themselves seem to be quite satisfied with their current lifestyles.  There is only one exception in the form of a scene where the young woman who works as a prostitute sits on her bed in her room and holds a stuffed animal in her hands.  There is a glimmer in her eyes that suggests that better days used to exist for her.  It would have been nice to see fragments of the family's past so that we could answer the following questions: Has this family always been this screwed up?  If not then what led them to become this way? What is the purpose of them holding a video camera and wanting to tape all of their atrocities?  Miike never bothers offering any answers.Visitor Q works well as long as it's taken strictly for what it is intended to be: a piece of exploitation filmmaking.  It doesn't challenge on any emotional level the way Audition does, it's just a forum to throw as many shocking scenes in the viewer's way.  Or is it perhaps meant as a social commentary on the ever-increasing absurdities of reality TV? Or a portrait of the changing dynamics of a Japanese society that has over the last couple of decades increasingly become attuned to the ways of the American models of entertainment and capitalism?  It's open to our own interpretation but one thing's for sure, Miike never fails to shock or to challenge.",3,The horrors of family dysfunction,1076371200,"02 10, 2004",2004,3762,"['When', 'outside', 'world', 'dealing', 'crap', 'job', 'day', 'day', 'love', 'life', 'nowhere', 'rejection', 'various', 'forms', 'often', 'turn', 'family', 'many', 'family', 'safety', 'nest', 'sanctuary', 'saneness', 'where', 'can', 'escape', 'pressures', 'day', 'life', 'why', 'films', 'dealing', 'disintegration', 'family', 'unit', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'shocking', 'unfathomable', 'What', 'when', 'even', 'family', 'nest', 'destroyed', 'thought', 'was', 'dear', 'shattered', 'pieces', 'have', 'seen', 'pretty', 'disturbing', 'cinematic', 'examples', 'past', 'most', 'notably', 'Cutting', 'Moments', 'Combat', 'Shock', 'had', 'asking', 'question', 'what', 'could', 'ever', 'happen', 'family', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'concept', 'family', 'dysfunction', 'new', 'extremes', 'Visitor', 'Q.Visitor', 'Q', 'Japanese', 'family', 'more', 'problems', 'could', 'shake', 'stick', 'movie', 'up', 'young', 'prostitute', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'engaging', 'intercourse', 'front', 'home-video', 'camera', 'act', 'man', 'expressing', 'remorse', 'doubt', 'what', 'doing', 'Remorse', 'what', 'cheating', 'wife', 'Nope', 'out', 'prostitute', 'actually', 'daughter', 'disturbing', 'act', 'not', 'long', 'lady', 'own', 'father', 'cries', 'early', 'bird', '100', '000Yen', 'act', 'way', 'more', 'then', 'can', 'afford', 'problem', 'girl', 'just', 'give', 'rest', 'sum', 'mom', 'once', 'have', 'Incest', 'first', 'many', 'atrocious', 'acts', 'committed', 'family', 'course', 'movie', 'viewer', 'submitted', 'various', 'scenes', 'necrophilia', 'domestic', 'violence', 'Most', 'bizarre', 'young', 'teenaged', 'boy', 'who', 'continuously', 'whips', 'up', 'mom', 'crack', 'addict', 'prostitute', 'Mom', ""n't"", 'seem', 'mind', 'too', 'much', 'even', 'boy', 'beat', 'up', 'even', 'harder', 'as', 'long', 'not', 'face.Visitor', 'Q', 'cheap', 'Snuff-film', 'kind', 'look', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'Miike', 'had', 'filmed', '8mm', 'camera', 'certainly', 'way', 'Miike', 'sole', 'intent', 'Visitor', 'Q', 'was', 'shock', 'viewer', 'many', 'outlandish', 'images', 'possible', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'success', 'However', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'quite', 'lacking', 'emotional', 'level', 'family', 'disturbing', 'actions', 'are', 'presented', 'such', 'hollow', 'way', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'even', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'towards', 'family', 'members', 'seem', 'be', 'quite', 'satisfied', 'current', 'lifestyles', 'only', 'one', 'exception', 'form', 'scene', 'where', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'prostitute', 'bed', 'room', 'stuffed', 'animal', 'hands', 'glimmer', 'eyes', 'better', 'days', 'used', 'exist', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'fragments', 'family', 'past', 'so', 'could', 'answer', 'following', 'questions', 'family', 'always', 'been', 'screwed', 'up', 'not', 'then', 'what', 'led', 'become', 'way', 'What', 'purpose', 'holding', 'video', 'camera', 'wanting', 'tape', 'atrocities', 'Miike', 'never', 'bothers', 'offering', 'answers.Visitor', 'Q', 'well', 'as', 'long', 'taken', 'strictly', 'what', 'intended', 'be', 'piece', 'exploitation', 'filmmaking', ""n't"", 'challenge', 'emotional', 'level', 'way', 'Audition', 'just', 'forum', 'throw', 'many', 'shocking', 'scenes', 'viewer', 'way', 'perhaps', 'meant', 'social', 'commentary', 'ever-increasing', 'absurdities', 'reality', 'TV', 'portrait', 'changing', 'dynamics', 'Japanese', 'society', 'over', 'last', 'couple', 'decades', 'increasingly', 'become', 'attuned', 'ways', 'American', 'models', 'entertainment', 'capitalism', 'open', 'own', 'interpretation', 'one', 'thing', 'sure', 'Miike', 'never', 'shock', 'challenge']",N/A

One day, while filming, a group of people physically abuse and humiliate him (All while his cameraman films it), Destined to turn it into a story he submits it to a local station who in turn makes a big joke out of him publicly using the tape.Now, he's destined to still become a reporter, Carrying a videocamera around with him wherever he goes, filming whatever possible to one day become a news anchor.. No matter what it is.His son (About 15) constantly beats his mother (The camera-man's wife) while their entire family ignores it. His mother prostitutes herself to afford drug's from the local drugdealer in the park. The son gets beat up, humiliated, and tormented everyday at school, as well as his house. The father decided instead of helping him, he'd rather film everything to hopefully turn that into local news to finally get the job he wanted. Finally, the mans daughter has just moved out of the house and is a prostitute herself (To afford a living on her own), her father even being a customer of hers (And again, filming everything). All while a strange man has moved into their house.The movie is very intense, and very disturbing in the short time it runs for (Just over an hour and 10 minutes total).It's the last 20 minutes that turn to traditional Miike-style going completely over the top in a humorous way. There are also a few funny adult jokes within the movie.The movie is definately not for everyone, including Miike-fans, its not the type of movie that warrants repeat viewings, but if you're not turned off by any of the above mentioned, it is an interesting movie that is much more unique than the norm and I'd recommend it. To anyone else even slightly disturbed by the mentioned above, save yourself the money and pass on this one :)I personally found it entertaining, but I've been a longtime Miike fan and have gotten used to some of his weirdness. For someone new to his work, I'd recommend purchasing his movie ""Ichi the killer"" instead, its a much easier film to get into and will appeal to a much larger audiance while having a cult feel to it.",3,A little too weird for myself.. but still entertaining.,1102550400,"12 9, 2004",2004,2967,"['Filmmaker', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'lot', 'movies', '62', 'total', '1991', 'one', 'weirder', 'last.Unfortunately', 'one', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'weird.Swaying', 'away', 'Miike', 'typical', 'over-the-top', 'action', 'stuff', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', 'such', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'massive', 'fight', 'much', 'more', 'psychotic', 'feel', 'film', 'work', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'will', 'surely', 'turn', 'most', 'viewers', 'film.In', 'first', '25', 'minutes', 'film', 'alone', 'see', 'Incest', 'Blackmail', 'Graphic', 'sex', 'Drug', 'use', 'Prostitution', 'Family', 'abuse', 'Nudity', 'Full', 'frontal', 'censored', 'Attacks', 'objects', 'Intense', 'chool', 'bullying', 'Sexual', 'assault.From', 'point', 'much', 'worse', 'movie', 'on.The', 'basic', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'reporter', 'least', 'tried', 'be', 'filming', 'encounters', 'street', 'hoping', 'one', 'day', 'become', 'popular', 'news-anchor', 'One', 'day', 'filming', 'group', 'people', 'physically', 'abuse', 'humiliate', 'cameraman', 'films', 'Destined', 'turn', 'story', 'local', 'station', 'who', 'turn', 'big', 'joke', 'publicly', 'using', 'tape.Now', 'destined', 'still', 'become', 'reporter', 'Carrying', 'videocamera', 'wherever', 'filming', 'possible', 'one', 'day', 'become', 'news', 'matter', 'what', 'son', '15', 'constantly', 'mother', 'camera-man', 'wife', 'entire', 'family', 'mother', 'afford', 'drug', 'local', 'drugdealer', 'park', 'son', 'beat', 'up', 'humiliated', 'tormented', 'everyday', 'school', 'as', 'well', 'house', 'father', 'decided', 'instead', 'helping', ""'d"", 'rather', 'film', 'everything', 'hopefully', 'turn', 'local', 'news', 'finally', 'get', 'job', 'wanted', 'Finally', 'mans', 'daughter', 'just', 'moved', 'out', 'house', 'prostitute', 'herself', 'afford', 'living', 'own', 'father', 'even', 'being', 'customer', 'hers', 'again', 'filming', 'everything', 'strange', 'man', 'moved', 'house.The', 'movie', 'very', 'intense', 'very', 'disturbing', 'short', 'time', 'Just', 'hour', '10', 'minutes', 'total', '.It', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'turn', 'traditional', 'Miike-style', 'going', 'completely', 'top', 'humorous', 'way', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'funny', 'adult', 'jokes', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'definately', 'not', 'everyone', 'including', 'Miike-fans', 'not', 'type', 'movie', 'warrants', 'repeat', 'viewings', ""'re"", 'not', 'turned', 'off', 'above', 'mentioned', 'interesting', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'unique', 'norm', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'else', 'even', 'slightly', 'disturbed', 'mentioned', 'save', 'money', 'pass', 'one', 'personally', 'found', 'entertaining', ""'ve"", 'been', 'longtime', 'Miike', 'fan', 'have', 'gotten', 'used', 'weirdness', 'someone', 'new', 'work', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'purchasing', 'movie', 'Ichi', 'killer', 'instead', 'much', 'easier', 'film', 'get', 'will', 'appeal', 'much', 'larger', 'audiance', 'having', 'cult', 'feel']",N/A

Obviously shot for the DVD market on a DV camera, this film has style and a whooping ending to boot, although the eastern type storytelling make put off many, not to mention the shock cinema value with very many blatantly upsetting scenes that never really falter from being classy horror-art... and it is... ALL OF IT!Although terribly slow for most who will view a foreign film for the first time, it is well worth it after the first milk scene and after experiencing that jaw dropper you will be hurtled into an amazing assault on your taboo while conjuring up scenes of absolutely brilliant originality. The `dead can get wet' mystery of life scene is probably one of the most dementedly innovative surprises that hits you like a gong from the end sequence in 2001. There are many moments in the movie that will leave your head swirling... you just cannot believe what you are seeing.The story concerns a dysfunctional family, a farther who sleeps with his daughter, has a spiralling downward career as a video reporter, get things done to him on video by criminals, has an abused son who tortures his smack-addicted mother, a bruised and battered woman who turns tricks for a few quid on the side. A stranger with a brick shows up and turns the family upside down, reaching gruesome climatically consequences that have a twist on the nuclear family. The further away from reality it gets the closer we are to home.Manic, but thoroughly a mastermind at work, Miike Takashi has some great films to boot. This one, Dead or Alive, Audition and Ichi the Killer are absolute musts. If you want to see something totally new (and you will), have the patients to allow a little eastern slow-mo into your life and are prepared to see some things truly defying belief then Visitor Q will deliver.To be honest I cannot praise this gem enough.

713321,A1J1163Q56YIVZ,B00006FDBW,Shaun Anderson,"[1, 1]","From the perspective of content ""Visitor Q"" is perhaps the outermost extension of Japanese director Takashi Miike's wild and tenacious tendency to discuss taste and taboo. This time however he couches his discourse in a purposefully flat, washed out digital video aesthetic, which works in contrast to the highly stylised sado-masochistic dystopia of ""Ichi the Killer"" or the genre confounding shock treatment of ""Audition"". The disintegration of the family and its redemption is an overriding theme in Miike's film, and in this film he creates a family wallowing in a vile pit of perversions and repressions. These perversions are allowed life because of the fragmented nature of the family and the disunity that badly needs repairing. Adding to Miike's stock in trade images of torture, anal violation and beheading we have necrophilia and incest. However it's quite easy in the west to get sidetracked into placing too much attention on the transgressive elements of Miike's cinema; something our critics regularly do. I personally believe that one of Miike's motives in celebrating such excess is a clever awareness of the politics of cult film reception in the west, and he constructs his films in a manner which self-consciously appeals to such a reading (in this respect comparisons with Tarantino are wholly appropriate).Beyond the vile, degrading and disgusting behaviour displayed in ""Visitor Q"" is ultimately a tale about familial alienation, parental failure and repressed emotions and desires. The titular visitor is the enigmatic, unknown and unknowable quantity that repairs the broken family, his motives are never known. The visitor also has a direct relationship with Miike's objective camera, suggesting on some level that the visitor is aligned with the audience.

Eager to get a copy of this, I watched it at a friends house after he told me it was totally and utterly OTT. He was right. But is it a good movie? Not really. Pushing the boundarys of bad taste doesn't make something worth watching.I love anything that breaks taboos and distresses the viewer, but Visitor Q simply has no soul to it. It didn't make me feel anything. I wasn't sad or angry, scared or happy,and to be honest it didn't make me laugh much either. In fact I found myself biting ym nails and playing with my thumbs. And, before you jump to conclusions, the laughs here are very very veryyyyy dark. Some would shoot me for even calling it humour.The way it goes, Visitor Q follows part of the life of a dysfunctional family, and trust me, boy are they dysfunctional. Some of the bizarre events in the movie include:A husband who cannot get enough of his wife's lactating nipples, a school boy who is tied to a fence and raped, a young girl who is suffocated and covered in excrement then taken into a greenhouse where she is raped and disembowled whilst the man's penis is stuck in the girls vagina due to rigamortis...you get the picture.Oh, and there's no music either. The whole thing is very flat. None of the characters are explored. There's limited dialogue and many of the scenes are simply longgggg and pointless shots of drug taking and torture. Something tells me Takeshi's love of school girl rape is unhealthy.So why 2 stars? Well, despite all the negatives, something still made me watch. And to be honest, it isn't the worst film ever made, it's simply Miike Takeshi's most dissapointing.SUMMARY!Theme - Disturbing look at a dysfunctional modern day Japanese family.Violence - Some, strong.Sex & Nudity - Frequent, prolonged and sadistic.Strong language- Frequent, very strong.",2,Visitor Q - In depth review.,1245715200,"06 23, 2009",2009,1953,"['Miike', 'Takeshi', 'eyes', 'one', 'top', 'Japanese', 'filmakers', 'world', 'today', 'Ichi', 'Killer', 'Audition', 'being', 'too', 'favourite', 'films', 'Eager', 'get', 'copy', 'watched', 'friends', 'house', 'told', 'was', 'totally', 'utterly', 'OTT', 'was', 'right', 'good', 'movie', 'Not', 'really', 'Pushing', 'boundarys', 'bad', 'taste', ""n't"", 'make', 'something', 'worth', 'watching.I', 'love', 'anything', 'taboos', 'viewer', 'Visitor', 'Q', 'simply', 'soul', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'feel', 'anything', 'was', ""n't"", 'sad', 'angry', 'scared', 'happy', 'be', 'honest', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'fact', 'found', 'biting', 'nails', 'playing', 'thumbs', 'jump', 'conclusions', 'laughs', 'here', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'veryyyyy', 'dark', 'would', 'shoot', 'even', 'calling', 'humour.The', 'way', 'Visitor', 'Q', 'part', 'life', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'trust', 'are', 'dysfunctional', 'bizarre', 'events', 'movie', 'include', 'husband', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'wife', 'lactating', 'nipples', 'school', 'boy', 'who', 'tied', 'fence', 'raped', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'suffocated', 'covered', 'excrement', 'then', 'taken', 'greenhouse', 'where', 'raped', 'disembowled', 'whilst', 'man', 'penis', 'stuck', 'girls', 'vagina', 'due', 'rigamortis', 'get', 'picture.Oh', 'music', 'either', 'whole', 'thing', 'very', 'flat', 'None', 'characters', 'are', 'explored', 'limited', 'dialogue', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'simply', 'longgggg', 'pointless', 'shots', 'drug', 'taking', 'torture', 'Something', 'tells', 'Takeshi', 'love', 'school', 'girl', 'rape', 'unhealthy.So', 'why', '2', 'stars', 'Well', 'negatives', 'something', 'still', 'made', 'watch', 'be', 'honest', ""n't"", 'worst', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'simply', 'Miike', 'Takeshi', 'most', 'dissapointing.SUMMARY', 'Theme', 'Disturbing', 'look', 'dysfunctional', 'modern', 'day', 'Japanese', 'family.Violence', 'strong.Sex', 'Nudity', 'Frequent', 'prolonged', 'sadistic.Strong', 'language-', 'Frequent', 'very', 'strong']",N/A

A mysterious, rock-wielding, scruffy young man joins the family and, eventually, changes occur.Words like `aberrant' and `taboo-bashing' are used inadequately to describe Takashi Miike's VISITOR Q.  It's an ink-black dark comedy, one that lingers over and delights in shocking scenes that more polite sleazy movies only hint at.For instance, VISITOR Q opens with an off-camera woman asking ""Did you ever do it with your dad?""  A question immediately followed by Daughter and Dad haggling over price and service.  A disturbing conversation which continues through disrobement to consummation.  It's a potentially unendurable scene that ends with Daughter taunting Dad by calling him ""early bird.""  Dad's eventual remorse seems almost an afterthought.  This isn't nearly the worst scene in the movie, either.  I won't give it away, but that graphic and extended sequence begins with Dad saying ""I don't care if you are a corpse....""Strong stuff, but the movie holds its curiously upbeat characters at enough of a distance and blurs the difference between victim and victimizer often enough to make it safely surreal.I liked VISITOR Q without really understanding what it meant or where it took us.  For instance, the scruffy young man seemed to be a pivotal character but I don't know why he went around hitting people over the head with rocks.  Maybe he was knocking sense into them. Maybe, as another character suggested, he was there to destroy the family.  The final sequence is bizarre, a bit shocking, and indecipherable, as well.

Not that I want theatres filled with excessive violence, incest, and necrophilia; it's that this film goes as far out as it wants to and never looks back. That kind of ballsy satire is what we need; anything to keep from being safe and PG-secure. Back to the point: this is an extremely edgy take on reality programming which features a truly disturbed family. Taboos are violated almost at random in the film's attempt to push and maintain it's distance from the expected well behaved Japanese family. As far as I'm concerned it works, and works well.This is not to say Visitor Q is an enjoyable watch, or a film you'd recommend to your friends, but you might if you like your entertainment off the wall and far, far from conventional. The basic plot follows a distorted nuclear family as they go through their day. Nothing is normal or expected in what they do, or more shockingly, how they react to each other's behaviors. It's the lack of response that's the kicker here, and you should really see it for yourself.I really did like this film.

713327,A20ELE6G4N447V,B00006FDBW,Steve Vander,"[5, 5]","A short R-rated Japanese ""horror"" film about a deranged family that videotapes their crimes by director Takashi Miike.  The movie stars Kenichi Endo, Shungiku Uchida, Kazushi Watanabe, and Shoko Nakahara.  The film contains nudity (both male and female; though a particular lower region is blurry on the front for both the men and women; going by the comic books, the blurring/censoring might be required by law in Japan - though in the movie, that blurring does not always occur).DVD features: Contains the movie (in Japanese with English subtitles) plus some extras.  The special features include: a director's biography (very detailed); liner notes (very detailed); and trailers (four trailers: Samurai Fiction; Freeze Me; Visitor Q; and Fudoh).The movie opens with what looks like a prostitute and a ""John"" in a hotel room (appearances can be deceiving).  Both have cameras, and the jerky camera work appears to represent what the two cameras see, sometimes at an extreme close-up view (though the woman is the one most often in view).  Then the camera becomes mostly stationary and the ""action"" unfolds (though the action is somewhat blurry - the action is blurry, and a particular area of the male form is deliberately blurred; and the stationary position changes).  The movie starts out seeming to be just a somewhat boring interaction in a hotel room.And then it turns strange.  A man (call him father), the same man from the first scene, is hit over the head.  Then a new scene, set in a disturbing home where the son dominates the mother, and what's this?  Father has brought his ""friend"" that hit him on the head over to his apartment to meet his wife and son.  It would appear that father is a journalist that had been trying to make a little documentary about how the youth are fairing in Japan, but was attacked.  The attack was video-taped and shown on the air (not the earlier attack mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph).  The man became disgraced and now is ""on-break.""  Well, his new idea is to film his own family, and document bullying.  The bullied end up bullying others.I suppose it is interesting just trying to figure out what is going on, or what the movie is truly supposed to be about.  Though it isn't that hard to figure out after a while (but, do you are you correct?).  With this type of strange movie, it is difficult to determine how much to reveal, so I'll need to leave the review vague.  I will say that the people involved appear insane, and there appears to be a slight similarity to the film ""15 Seconds"" in that both include criminals video-taping their acts, though they are very different movies.The sick and disturbing movie contains violence (both of the bullying nature and of the sexual nature - women getting attacked), torture, whipping, drug use, death, dismemberment, necrophilia (and the dangers of said acts), and incest.  A strange disturbing little movie (though it can be strangely funny at least one time).  Hard to rate this type of movie, or know which category to place it.  Good music at least.  Due to the need to use the subtitles, and the strange nature of the film, it is hard to critic the acting, nor can proper crediting be given (most of the credits appear to be in Japanese; a list of the actors is given in English, but not matched up with any particular part).

Most elements of the family's disfunction were either taken strait from the Japanese newspapers or bore incredible similarity, but, the genius of that was lost when every thing from incest, fulls scenes showing middle-aged lactating, scatology, necrophilia, domestic abuse and murder were featured in an almost pornographic-like manner.This was Miike showing off and patting himself on the back while doing it. Sadly, it really is, or could be, a great story, but the story itself seemed to much to be a means of holding graphic scene of every taboo together.",2,....,1072310400,"12 25, 2003",2003,866,"[""'m"", 'big', 'Miike', 'fan', 'must', 'admit', 'Visitor', 'Q', 'left', 'unimpressed', 'bit', 'sick', 'attempt', 'push', 'cross', 'line', 'illustrating', 'moral.I', 'loved', 'film', 'exposure', 'elements..true', 'elements', 'what', 'be', 'downfall', 'Japanese', 'even', 'Western', 'family', 'life/structure', 'Most', 'elements', 'family', 'disfunction', 'were', 'either', 'taken', 'strait', 'Japanese', 'newspapers', 'bore', 'incredible', 'similarity', 'genius', 'was', 'lost', 'when', 'thing', 'incest', 'scenes', 'showing', 'middle-aged', 'lactating', 'scatology', 'necrophilia', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'murder', 'were', 'featured', 'almost', 'pornographic-like', 'manner.This', 'was', 'Miike', 'showing', 'off', 'patting', 'back', 'doing', 'Sadly', 'really', 'could', 'be', 'great', 'story', 'story', 'seemed', 'much', 'be', 'means', 'holding', 'graphic', 'scene', 'taboo', 'together']",N/A
713332,A2YRHIJGRGMB6Q,B00006FDBW,Victor Schwartzman,"[9, 21]","It took several visits to this film before I finished watching it.  There is a reason why it took so long, and it is not just because I am too busy.First: I like Takashi Miike's films, at least the ones I've seen.  Loved Audition.  Thought Ichi The Killer was quite remarkable.  Dead or Alive--it pushed the envelope but was enjoyable, especially if taken as a depiction of a modern day Sodom and Gomorrah.But Visitor Q I found disturbing, and not often in a good sense.The film, shot on video to resemble the video productions of its protagonist, tells the story of the profound disintegration of the protagonist, along with his family.  The film begins with him paying for sex with his own daughter, and moves down (or up, depending on your point of view) from there.  His son beats the protagonist's wife, his mother, mercilessly.  In turn, the son is beaten by his friends.  The mother prostitutes herself to get heroin for herself.Frankly, it started to feel just too ugly for me.  And I can handle violence.  But this was nasty. I wondered what the point was, but it was unclear that there was any point but to force the viewer to wallow in the degredation.  As such, the film is a satire on reality shows, yes.  But did it have to make me feel so dirty?I kept thinking: it's me.  This is the same director who did Audition, a beautifully crafted thriller with a lot to say.  Some of the same points are made in Visitor Q.  But I could not escape the feeling that Miike was rubbing not just my nose in it, but my face in it, then my whole body.SPOILER:The ending has the protagonist killing a former lover when she criticizes him, then having sex with her body.  Then more sex with her body.  Then his wife shoots him up with heroin while he's...you get the idea.  Then he and his wife, in the spirit of family togetherness, kill the boys who are tormenting their son.Frankly, it feels just plain sick.And this from me, who thinks that The Wild Bunch could have gone a lot farther.So, please be warned.  This is not typical Miike, at least not from what I have seen of his work.  It is nasty, unpleasant.  It is beyond grim, if you think at all about it.Instead, buy The Bird People In China.  Entertainment should be somehow uplifting, should it not?If there was 'redemption' in this film, as one person has tagged it, then I missed the redemption.

It has everything else though, including things I never imagined.  I bought this movie sight unseen because of who directed it, and until that moment I never realized that I had a complete and total lack of movies about incest, lactational-watersports, and necrophilia.  This movie took care of all three in one fell swoop.Interestingly, this movie is fairly simple and straightforward compared to movies like Audition, and The Happiness of the Katakuris.  I had to watch those movies several times (and if you've never seen Audition you can't imagine how hard that can be) before I felt that I had a grasp of what was going on.  Visitor Q is pretty simple:  an angel comes to help a dysfunctional family get back together.  That said, don't be fooled into complacency!  Watch this movie alone first, and then think long and hard about who you plan to show it tooThere are two major annoyances in the film.  One is that since it is Japanese, they blur out things that would be perfectly OK in an American movie.
