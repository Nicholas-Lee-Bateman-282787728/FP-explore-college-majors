Just wish they'd include the dance steps so the moms out there can learn the dances faster!  The song ""Captain Feathersword Ahoy"" is just amazing.  The first time I saw it on the Disney channel I just sat down and couldn't believe it.  Never has there been such attention paid to children's programming as what these guys are doing.  A fully choreographed dance number, that song just captivates my child each time.

Wags is featured quite often in this program, as are the dancers and the other characters.  I must say, though, that the choreography in this video far exceeds some of the others Wiggles programs.  There are great numbers of course, but the centerpiece of the show is that the Big Red Car is stuck in place and they need to find someone to fix it, so they ask Wags, and he can't, and they ask different others, but they can't, and finally, Captain Feathersword tries his luck, and fails and gets exhaust in his face.Towards the end of the video, of course, there has to be a solution, and the ""mechanic"" is called, and he encourages the Wiggles that the Big Red Car ""runs"" on music, so they enlist the aid of everyone in the cast.There are some really unique ensemble pieces, such as ""Wags does the Tango,"" ""Zardo's Dance,"" and a few other dance numbers which really make the video great.

I have the other Wiggles videos and I like them all, but this one stands out above the rest due to the show quality choreography and the movie-like rhythm of each song. The short skits in between are very funny and flow perfectly with the story. It is like watching a really good movie, which makes you feel like a joyful kid again. If you are in a bad mood watching this video will surely cheer you up.My baby is only 5 months old, but she loves watching The Wiggles. I am 35 and I love it to, and so does my husband. The songs are very good and catchy. The only problem is they will sing in your head while you try to sleep at night. The dancing is spectacular! In fact, I advice you to throw away all your aerobics videos, and dance to The Wiggles moves in this tape instead. It is much better due to the shear fun factor and the variety of steps, most of which are high impact aerobics.The Wiggles have the formula perfected for childhood imagination, fun, song and dance! This is a wonderful video to sing and dance to and it will make you feel young, happy and carefree too. What could be better then that for a child, or for a child's parent for that matter?

This show is gut wrenchingly hilarious. The sets are colourful, bizarre, or amusingly trippy, and the songs are fabulous. Everytime I find a Wiggles episode playing on the T.V. I end up sprawled on the floor convulsed in fits of giggles. The characters are nightmarish, garish, and very, very funny. A typical song would have a very tall and very skinny police officer ( gender ambiguous ) hobble around drunkeningly, an octopus with two rubber limbs, something called Dorothy that squeals like Minnie Mouse in Helium Land and looks like the product of nuclear waste, and a pirate, a red car, and a bunch of children that look like they're being paid a thousand dollars a minute to act as happy as they can. In the middle of all this cheerful insanity are the Wiggles themselves. A lot of their antics are just plain bizarre, as I've mentioned earlier, but a few of their skits are actually truly funny, in a late 60's British surreal humour kind of way. It's bad, yes... it's REALLY bad, but it's so extraordinarily campy that people decades from now will look back and think to themselves, ""My God...
