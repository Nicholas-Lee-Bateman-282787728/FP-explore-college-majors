While I love this show, I am puzzled and a bit upset that 2 episodes will be left off season 4 and 3 episodes are left off of season 5. Is this because 5 years from now they will offer one of those complete series packs so that to get the missing episodes we will have to dish out even more money!!!So be warned. But having said all that the show is great It takes on a ton of social issues. Racism is always just under the surface of every episode and many episodes takes on that issue. There is a good mix of off beat humor. This adds some relief when dealing with sensitive issues.A great show but missing episodes!!!

1678751,A2ZELOPYDRS6VU,B00GM1X2RO,Love Our Military Men,"[10, 10]","I am so happy to finally see more releases to DVD of the television series IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT, although I had to kinda laugh as this is the most unusual sequence release schedule I've ever seen for a series. First we had the 24 Hour Marathon release, then Season One, Season Eight and now Seasons Four and Five - but it's all good and I am happy to get them 'however' the studio wishes to release them. Season three (not yet released) and four is where this series really hits it's stride.Airing for 142 episodes (plus 4 TV movies) from 1988-1995, IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT was a great crime/drama series that starred Carroll O'Conner as ""Chief 'Bill' Gillespie"" of the Sparta Police Department in Mississippi and centered on a lot of small town politics as well as catching criminals. It was a role that was really suited for Carroll O'Conner, and of course, Alan Autry as ""Lt. 'Bubba' Skinner"" sure filled out his uniform v-e-r-y nicely! :o)This five disc set is the '90-'91 season and below is a brief summary of the episodes:(DISC 1)LESSONS LEARNED - Chief Gillespie is shocked by the seemingly uncaring reaction of the father of a murdered teenage prostitute.PERVERSIONS OF JUSTICE - Gillespie tries to calm public furor while investigating charges a science teacher molested a student....AND JUSTICE FOR SOME - Gillespie and Virgil have different game plans concerning the fate of a federal criminal who is linked to a local hit-and-run case.HEARTS OF GOLD - Bubba's romance with a high school sweetheart conflicts with the murder investigation of an attorney.(DISC 2)QUICK FIX - Evidence indicates a mentally impaired girl is the mother of an infant found in a shallow grave.HOMECOMING - An ex-convict strives to turn over a new leaf: only to be thwarted at every turn.A PROBLEM TOO PERSONAL - Gillespie appears to be apathetic about prosecuting Harriet Delong's ex-husband, who has been arrested on a murder and robbery charge.A FINAL ARRANGEMENT - An elderly woman who befriended Sweet is found murdered in her bookstore.(DISC 3)FAMILY MATTERS - Titus attempts to reunite his family, only to come up against a rebellious cousin who has led a life of crime.BOUNTY HUNTER - Gillespie must stop a hired bounty hunter who plans to kill a Sparta man wanted for questioning in a Houston murder.BLESSINGS - A local reporter writes an article on an unconsenting Gillespie, who suspects her motives.EXECUTION OF TRUST - A psychiatrist protects a patient who confessed to a murder for which an innocent man stands to be executed.(DISC 4)CHILD OF PROMISE - A drug-related crime wave hits Sparta, and soon murder is on the cards.PAPER CASTLES - A fatal car crash causes suspicion: it is linked with plans to build a new mall in the town.LAID TO WASTE - Gillespie and TIbbs investigate a murder intended to cover up the illegal dumping of toxic waste.FIRST DEADLY SIN - A boy witnesses a rape, but his overprotective father refuses to let him tell the police what he saw.(DISC 5)JUST A COUNTRY BOY - Bubba travels to Los Angeles to arrest an arsonist, but uncovers Mob activity and murder on the way.NO OTHER ROAD - Lonnie Jamison and VIrgil show a despondent Eugene DeLong, who father is facing the death penalty for murder, that life continues.A TURNING - Gillespie and TIbbs track the killers of two drug dealers; Althea worries about the dangers Virgil faces and suggests he change careers.As stated in the product description, due to licensing issues, the episodes ""Brotherly Love"" and ""Shine on Sparta Moon"" will not be included in this release.The picture quality to date has been quite good.I'm off to place my order for seasons four and five :0) Anxiously waiting for seasons 3, 6 and 7!",4,IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT SEASON FOUR - SO HAPPY TO SEE MORE RELEASES - DESPITE THE UNUSUAL SEQUENCE/RELEASE SCHEDULE,1386547200,"12 9, 2013",2013,3697,"['am', 'so', 'happy', 'finally', 'see', 'more', 'releases', 'DVD', 'television', 'series', 'IN', 'THE', 'HEAT', 'THE', 'NIGHT', 'had', 'kinda', 'laugh', 'most', 'unusual', 'sequence', 'release', 'schedule', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'series', 'First', 'had', '24', 'Hour', 'Marathon', 'release', 'then', 'Season', 'One', 'Season', 'Eight', 'now', 'Seasons', 'Four', 'Five', 'good', 'am', 'happy', 'get', 'studio', 'release', 'Season', 'three', 'not', 'yet', 'released', 'four', 'where', 'series', 'really', 'stride.Airing', '142', 'episodes', '4', 'TV', 'movies', '1988-1995', 'IN', 'THE', 'HEAT', 'THE', 'NIGHT', 'was', 'great', 'crime/drama', 'series', 'starred', 'Carroll', ""O'Conner"", 'Chief', ""'Bill"", 'Gillespie', 'Sparta', 'Police', 'Department', 'Mississippi', 'centered', 'lot', 'small', 'town', 'politics', 'as', 'well', 'catching', 'criminals', 'was', 'role', 'was', 'really', 'suited', 'Carroll', ""O'Conner"", 'course', 'Alan', 'Autry', 'Lt.', ""'Bubba"", 'Skinner', 'sure', 'filled', 'out', 'uniform', 'v-e-r-y', 'nicely', 'o', 'five', 'disc', 'set', ""'90-'91"", 'season', 'below', 'brief', 'summary', 'episodes', 'DISC', '1', 'LESSONS', 'LEARNED', 'Chief', 'Gillespie', 'shocked', 'seemingly', 'uncaring', 'reaction', 'father', 'murdered', 'teenage', 'prostitute.PERVERSIONS', 'OF', 'JUSTICE', 'Gillespie', 'calm', 'public', 'furor', 'investigating', 'charges', 'science', 'teacher', 'molested', 'student', 'JUSTICE', 'FOR', 'SOME', 'Gillespie', 'Virgil', 'have', 'different', 'game', 'plans', 'concerning', 'fate', 'federal', 'criminal', 'who', 'linked', 'local', 'hit-and-run', 'case.HEARTS', 'OF', 'GOLD', 'Bubba', 'romance', 'high', 'school', 'sweetheart', 'murder', 'investigation', 'attorney', 'DISC', '2', 'QUICK', 'FIX', 'Evidence', 'mentally', 'impaired', 'girl', 'mother', 'infant', 'found', 'shallow', 'grave.HOMECOMING', 'ex-convict', 'strives', 'turn', 'over', 'new', 'leaf', 'only', 'be', 'thwarted', 'turn.A', 'PROBLEM', 'TOO', 'PERSONAL', 'Gillespie', 'be', 'apathetic', 'prosecuting', 'Harriet', 'Delong', 'ex-husband', 'who', 'been', 'arrested', 'murder', 'robbery', 'charge.A', 'FINAL', 'ARRANGEMENT', 'elderly', 'woman', 'who', 'befriended', 'Sweet', 'found', 'murdered', 'bookstore', 'DISC', '3', 'FAMILY', 'MATTERS', 'Titus', 'attempts', 'reunite', 'family', 'only', 'come', 'up', 'rebellious', 'cousin', 'who', 'led', 'life', 'crime.BOUNTY', 'HUNTER', 'Gillespie', 'must', 'stop', 'hired', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'who', 'kill', 'Sparta', 'man', 'wanted', 'questioning', 'Houston', 'murder.BLESSINGS', 'local', 'reporter', 'article', 'unconsenting', 'Gillespie', 'who', 'motives.EXECUTION', 'OF', 'TRUST', 'psychiatrist', 'patient', 'who', 'confessed', 'murder', 'innocent', 'man', 'be', 'executed', 'DISC', '4', 'CHILD', 'OF', 'PROMISE', 'drug-related', 'crime', 'wave', 'hits', 'Sparta', 'soon', 'murder', 'cards.PAPER', 'CASTLES', 'fatal', 'car', 'crash', 'suspicion', 'linked', 'plans', 'build', 'new', 'mall', 'town.LAID', 'TO', 'WASTE', 'Gillespie', 'TIbbs', 'investigate', 'murder', 'intended', 'cover', 'up', 'illegal', 'dumping', 'toxic', 'waste.FIRST', 'DEADLY', 'SIN', 'boy', 'rape', 'overprotective', 'father', 'let', 'tell', 'police', 'what', 'saw', 'DISC', '5', 'JUST', 'COUNTRY', 'BOY', 'Bubba', 'travels', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'arrest', 'arsonist', 'uncovers', 'Mob', 'activity', 'murder', 'way.NO', 'OTHER', 'ROAD', 'Lonnie', 'Jamison', 'VIrgil', 'show', 'despondent', 'Eugene', 'DeLong', 'who', 'father', 'facing', 'death', 'penalty', 'murder', 'life', 'continues.A', 'TURNING', 'Gillespie', 'TIbbs', 'track', 'killers', 'two', 'drug', 'dealers', 'Althea', 'dangers', 'Virgil', 'change', 'careers.As', 'stated', 'product', 'description', 'due', 'licensing', 'issues', 'episodes', 'Brotherly', 'Love', 'Shine', 'Sparta', 'Moon', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'included', 'release.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'date', 'been', 'quite', 'good.I', ""'m"", 'place', 'order', 'seasons', 'four', 'five', ':0', 'Anxiously', 'waiting', 'seasons', '3', '6', '7']",In The Heat of the Night Season 4
