Those who grew up with baseball from the 1950s to the present will really appreciate this set. It fleshes out many of the stories and legends one may have forgotten, and the breadth of the coverage is just amazing. I just do not see how any true fan of baseball can pass this set up for the pictures, videos, stories and anecdotes from players from the past. I was very glad to see that emphasis was placed on Jackie Robinson's place in history. Many of the horrors and indignities he dealt with certainly drove him to an early grave, but he showed amazing courage to follow the advice of Branch Rickey and play through all the hurt he endured through his life. Some players were just athletes, but he was a true hero.

37270,AOMDGKZTVIE9P,0780630459,Andrew Collins,"[1, 1]","In this fantastic retrospective of baseball, the history of the game is looked at. With the genius of Ken Burns producing it, the entire series is a joy to watch and learn about the stories and the people that has shaped baseball over the years.The original series, which aired in 1994, covers the history of the game from its origins in the 19th century up until the early 1990s. The series is divided into nine episodes, called ""innings,"" that each cover a portion of history. Throughout that period there would be many characters, events, and stories that make the history of baseball interesting. Players such as Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth, Jackie Robinson, and many, many others. The history of baseball also offers parallels with the history of the United States. Things such as labor disputes (players versus owners) and the struggle of black players. During the first half of the 20th century, black players were kept out of professional baseball by a ""gentlemen's agreement"" between owners. Blacks instead formed their own ""Negro Leagues"" to play baseball with some amount of professionalism. Eventually, the call for equality came and baseball, and eventually America, too, would experience legal integration. There are also many events in the history of the game such as the 1919 Black Sox scandal and others that would make or break games or championships.In the late 2000s, Burns began work on an addition to Baseball titled ""The Tenth Inning"" covering the recent history of the game from about 1994-2009. Admittedly, The Tenth Inning did not meet the quality of the original series, too much coverage of too little, but still was interesting to watch.I myself am not a fan of baseball, but I do enjoy history and baseball has a lot to offer in that. Ken Burns has brought to life great stories and people that shaped the game over the years. I would recommend Baseball to anyone who is a fan of the game or just interested in a part of American history.",5,America's Pastime,1365897600,"04 14, 2013",2013,1959,"['fantastic', 'retrospective', 'baseball', 'history', 'game', 'looked', 'genius', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'producing', 'entire', 'series', 'joy', 'watch', 'learn', 'stories', 'people', 'shaped', 'baseball', 'years.The', 'original', 'series', 'aired', '1994', 'history', 'game', 'origins', '19th', 'century', 'up', 'early', '1990s', 'series', 'divided', 'nine', 'episodes', 'called', 'innings', 'cover', 'portion', 'history', 'period', 'would', 'be', 'many', 'characters', 'events', 'stories', 'make', 'history', 'baseball', 'interesting', 'Players', 'such', 'Ty', 'Cobb', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'many', 'many', 'others', 'history', 'baseball', 'also', 'parallels', 'history', 'United', 'States', 'Things', 'such', 'labor', 'disputes', 'players', 'versus', 'owners', 'struggle', 'black', 'players', 'first', 'half', '20th', 'century', 'black', 'players', 'were', 'kept', 'professional', 'baseball', 'gentlemen', 'agreement', 'owners', 'Blacks', 'instead', 'formed', 'own', 'Negro', 'Leagues', 'play', 'baseball', 'amount', 'professionalism', 'Eventually', 'call', 'equality', 'came', 'baseball', 'eventually', 'America', 'too', 'would', 'experience', 'legal', 'integration', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'events', 'history', 'game', 'such', '1919', 'Black', 'Sox', 'scandal', 'others', 'would', 'make', 'break', 'games', 'championships.In', 'late', '2000s', 'Burns', 'began', 'work', 'addition', 'Baseball', 'titled', 'Tenth', 'Inning', 'covering', 'recent', 'history', 'game', '1994-2009', 'Admittedly', 'Tenth', 'Inning', 'did', 'not', 'meet', 'quality', 'original', 'series', 'too', 'much', 'coverage', 'too', 'little', 'still', 'was', 'interesting', 'watch.I', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'baseball', 'do', 'enjoy', 'history', 'baseball', 'lot', 'offer', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'brought', 'life', 'great', 'stories', 'people', 'shaped', 'game', 'years', 'would', 'recommend', 'Baseball', 'anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'game', 'just', 'interested', 'part', 'American', 'history']",N/A

Once you notice it, you can't un-notice it is awful.- I am not sure why some of the talking heads were chosen. Why on earth would the series devote time to Mario Cuomo? Sure, he was governor of NY and a brief minor leaguer but why does anyone care what he thinks about baseball? Billy Crystal is famous for being a Yankee fan, I enjoy him, but again why is he featured so prominently?- As others have noted, this is a HEAVY NY focused series. Granted the story of baseball certainly needs a heavy focus on the Dodgers, Giants and Yankees but Ken Burns (from, shocker, NY) clearly decided that NY was going to be the focus and it is a detriment to the series.- There isn't much variety in the talking heads. i.e. On top of a huge NY focus, it is the same people who mostly have no connection to the game other than being a fan. I get it, George Will is a baseball fan, were none of the hundreds of players or managers available to talk?

Seeing and hearing Babe Ruth, Ted Williams, Jackie Robinson and others cannot help but stir the passion of anyone with even a passing interest in the game.Some others who have reviewed this tape have criticized it for being centered on New York teams and for neglecting some of the teams who came from nowhere to win titles. This criticism is true, but unfounded. There were two things that dramatically changed the game and both took place in New York. The first was when Babe Ruth began hitting home runs at a pace previously unthinkable. I consider his numbers in the early years as a Yankee outfielder to be the most amazing statistics in all of sports. It is incredible that he hit more home runs than many others teams did in those seasons. Some talk negatively about the adulation given to sports stars these days, and yet none approaches the level of stardom achieved by Ruth.The second was when Jackie Robinson joined the Brooklyn Dodgers. We celebrate Martin Luther King day as a tribute to his struggle for civil rights. However, it can be strongly argued, and correctly in my opinion, that Jackie Robinson did more for the struggle than Dr. King did. The pressure on Robinson was enormous, at times having thousands of people screaming abuse at him. And yet he succeeded on the field, still considered by many to be the most exciting player of his generation. It is also hard to underestimate the effect this had on the American society. Many people who otherwise would have nothing to do with a black man cheered him on the field, and found at least some of their attitudes changed.The lament of the Boston Red Sox is also a major part of the video. No one could possibly forget the Carlton Fisk home run or that slow ground ball moving through Bill Buckner's legs. I saw both live and each kept me up for hours after the event.  One statement made several times in the tape that may seem frivolous is how the grass just seems greener in baseball stadiums. My personal experience backs that. The greenest, most beautiful grass I have ever seen was in Wrigley Field.Baseball is a great game, the only major one where many of the players just don't look like athletes. Babe Ruth looked more like a bartender than an athlete as did some pitchers of the sixties and seventies. And yet they have some of the most incredible skills, as I can attest after trying to hit a ninety mile-per-hour fastball. I lived baseball in my youth, but lately the pressures of a career have led me astray. This tape brought me back to my younger days when I knew all the great players as well as their lifetime statistics.  It made me something that I have rarely if ever been, nostalgic for my youth.",5,Baseball as a form of religion,1017705600,"04 2, 2002",2002,2847,"['When', 'watching', 'video', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'had', 'tears', 'eyes', 'was', 'wonderful', 'see', 'archive', 'footage', 'great', 'names', 'baseball', 'Seeing', 'hearing', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'Ted', 'Williams', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'others', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'stir', 'passion', 'anyone', 'even', 'passing', 'interest', 'game.Some', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'reviewed', 'tape', 'have', 'criticized', 'being', 'centered', 'New', 'York', 'teams', 'neglecting', 'teams', 'who', 'came', 'nowhere', 'win', 'titles', 'criticism', 'true', 'unfounded', 'were', 'two', 'things', 'dramatically', 'changed', 'game', 'took', 'place', 'New', 'York', 'first', 'was', 'when', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'began', 'hitting', 'home', 'runs', 'pace', 'previously', 'unthinkable', 'consider', 'numbers', 'early', 'years', 'Yankee', 'outfielder', 'be', 'most', 'amazing', 'statistics', 'sports', 'incredible', 'hit', 'more', 'home', 'runs', 'many', 'others', 'teams', 'did', 'seasons', 'talk', 'negatively', 'adulation', 'given', 'sports', 'stars', 'days', 'yet', 'none', 'level', 'stardom', 'achieved', 'Ruth.The', 'second', 'was', 'when', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'joined', 'Brooklyn', 'Dodgers', 'celebrate', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'day', 'tribute', 'struggle', 'civil', 'rights', 'However', 'can', 'be', 'strongly', 'argued', 'correctly', 'opinion', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'did', 'more', 'struggle', 'Dr.', 'King', 'did', 'pressure', 'Robinson', 'was', 'enormous', 'times', 'having', 'thousands', 'people', 'screaming', 'abuse', 'yet', 'succeeded', 'field', 'still', 'considered', 'many', 'be', 'most', 'exciting', 'player', 'generation', 'also', 'hard', 'underestimate', 'effect', 'had', 'American', 'society', 'Many', 'people', 'who', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'black', 'man', 'cheered', 'field', 'found', 'least', 'attitudes', 'changed.The', 'lament', 'Boston', 'Red', 'Sox', 'also', 'major', 'part', 'video', 'one', 'could', 'possibly', 'forget', 'Carlton', 'Fisk', 'home', 'run', 'slow', 'ground', 'ball', 'moving', 'Bill', 'Buckner', 'legs', 'saw', 'live', 'kept', 'up', 'hours', 'event', 'One', 'statement', 'made', 'several', 'times', 'tape', 'may', 'seem', 'frivolous', 'how', 'grass', 'just', 'greener', 'baseball', 'stadiums', 'personal', 'experience', 'backs', 'greenest', 'most', 'beautiful', 'grass', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'was', 'Wrigley', 'Field.Baseball', 'great', 'game', 'only', 'major', 'one', 'where', 'many', 'players', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'athletes', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'looked', 'more', 'bartender', 'athlete', 'did', 'pitchers', 'sixties', 'seventies', 'yet', 'have', 'most', 'incredible', 'skills', 'can', 'attest', 'trying', 'hit', 'ninety', 'mile-per-hour', 'fastball', 'lived', 'baseball', 'youth', 'lately', 'pressures', 'career', 'have', 'led', 'astray', 'tape', 'brought', 'back', 'younger', 'days', 'when', 'knew', 'great', 'players', 'as', 'well', 'lifetime', 'statistics', 'made', 'something', 'have', 'rarely', 'ever', 'been', 'nostalgic', 'youth']",N/A

37286,A2FS38D943KX12,0780630459,chefdevergue,"[63, 75]","Ken Burns is becoming well-known as much for what he leaves out of his documentaries as for what he tells you and how he tells it.  One sees it somewhat in the Civil War documentary (unless of course you are a Lost Cause devotee, in which case you view that series as horribly biased and riddled with errors), and it is definitely (and troublingly) evident in his Jazz documentary, where 40 years of jazz is virtually glossed over in favor of an almost obsessive fixation on Louis Armstrong.  In the case of ""Baseball,"" Burns again leaves out huge chunks of the story, although the end result is nonetheless entertaining.In the case of ""Baseball,"" the unrelenting focus is on New York City, Babe Ruth & Jackie Robinson, and to be fair, there is no way you could discuss the subject of baseball without devoting a great deal of time to these subjects.  However, the title of the documentary is ""Baseball,"" not ""The New York City, Babe Ruth, and Jackie Robinson Story,"" and it is possible to watch this documentary at times and come to believe that nothing else was happening out side of New York most of the time.I recall reading a Sports Illustrated article a few years ago that discussed the Philadelphia Athletics from 1929-1931, and made the case that that team was better than the famed ""Murderer's Row"" Yankees of 1926-1928, and possibly the best team in baseball history.  The article's author crunched the numbers, compared the stats, and made a pretty compelling case.  He then asked why so little attention has been paid to the A's over the years, and posited that because most of the nation's important papers and sportswriters were based in New York City;  by default the majority of the great sportswriting was devoted to the Yankees, while relatively backwater Philadelphia languished in obscurity.  It seems to be the same situation with Burns.  While other incredibly dominant teams such as (in the early years) the Chicago Cubs, the A's, the Pittsburgh Pirates & the Detroit Tigers are given passing mention, they are quickly shoved on the back burner in favor of the Boston Red Sox & New York Giants.  Then the Yankees & the Dodgers begin to coalesce, and it is all New York, all the time.  One gets no feeling for how dominant the 1929-1931 A's (or the St. Louis Cardinals of the mid-1930's) were, because Burns continually focuses on Babe Ruth & the Negro Leagues.When Burns gets to the 1950's he can be excused, because really it was a New York-dominated decade like no other.  However, the other decades did in fact see a more competitive balance, and one would not get this impression from the documentary.It would have been nice if Burns hadn't crammed the last quarter century of his story into one ""inning.""  Are you telling me that the stories since 1970 aren't as compelling as the early years of baseball.  I don't believe that Burns would have had to devote that much more time to the post-1970 era to make it feel less cursory and rushed.  This is a somewhat annoying tendency of his that was more griveously evident when he made ""Jazz.""Also, I get a little tired of the ""poetry of baseball"" school of thought.  It isn't as though I am some knuckle-dragging troglodyte who gets all his news from sports radio; I am just as likely to go to the opera as to the ballpark.  This baseball as metaphor for how the cosmos works gets on my nerves after a while (although I consider Roger Angell's comment ""there's more Met than Yankee in all of us"" to be priceless beyond description).  It's not that baseball doesn't imbue our life with a little extra something special, it's just that some of these talking heads tend to get a little overwrought.I enjoyed watching the documentary the first time, and I have watched it probably half a dozen times since over the years.  By comparison, I have watched ""The Civil War"" about 15 times, I would guess.  I was so disappointed with ""Jazz"" that I managed only a second viewing.  In any case, ""Baseball"" is very entertaining, and that is what largely accounts for my 4-star rating  I would only caution those who don't know their baseball history that this documentary omits a great deal of what is a very good story.",4,"View it as entertainment, not as history",1089244800,"07 8, 2004",2004,4182,"['Ken', 'Burns', 'becoming', 'well-known', 'much', 'what', 'documentaries', 'what', 'how', 'One', 'somewhat', 'Civil', 'War', 'documentary', 'course', 'are', 'Lost', 'Cause', 'devotee', 'case', 'view', 'series', 'horribly', 'biased', 'riddled', 'errors', 'definitely', 'troublingly', 'evident', 'Jazz', 'documentary', 'where', '40', 'years', 'jazz', 'virtually', 'glossed', 'over', 'favor', 'almost', 'obsessive', 'fixation', 'Louis', 'Armstrong', 'case', 'Baseball', 'Burns', 'again', 'out', 'huge', 'chunks', 'story', 'end', 'result', 'nonetheless', 'entertaining.In', 'case', 'Baseball', 'unrelenting', 'focus', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'be', 'fair', 'way', 'could', 'discuss', 'subject', 'baseball', 'devoting', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'subjects', 'However', 'title', 'documentary', 'Baseball', 'not', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'Story', 'possible', 'watch', 'documentary', 'times', 'come', 'believe', 'nothing', 'else', 'was', 'happening', 'out', 'side', 'New', 'York', 'most', 'time.I', 'recall', 'reading', 'Sports', 'Illustrated', 'article', 'few', 'years', 'discussed', 'Philadelphia', 'Athletics', '1929-1931', 'made', 'case', 'team', 'was', 'better', 'famed', 'Murderer', 'Row', 'Yankees', '1926-1928', 'possibly', 'best', 'team', 'baseball', 'history', 'article', 'author', 'crunched', 'numbers', 'compared', 'stats', 'made', 'pretty', 'compelling', 'case', 'then', 'asked', 'why', 'so', 'little', 'attention', 'been', 'paid', 'A', 'years', 'posited', 'most', 'nation', 'important', 'papers', 'sportswriters', 'were', 'based', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'default', 'majority', 'great', 'sportswriting', 'was', 'devoted', 'Yankees', 'relatively', 'backwater', 'Philadelphia', 'languished', 'obscurity', 'be', 'same', 'situation', 'Burns', 'other', 'incredibly', 'dominant', 'teams', 'such', 'early', 'years', 'Chicago', 'Cubs', 'A', 'Pittsburgh', 'Pirates', 'Detroit', 'Tigers', 'are', 'given', 'passing', 'mention', 'are', 'quickly', 'shoved', 'back', 'burner', 'favor', 'Boston', 'Red', 'Sox', 'New', 'York', 'Giants', 'Then', 'Yankees', 'Dodgers', 'begin', 'coalesce', 'New', 'York', 'time', 'One', 'feeling', 'how', 'dominant', '1929-1931', 'A', 'St.', 'Louis', 'Cardinals', 'mid-1930', 'were', 'Burns', 'continually', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'Negro', 'Leagues.When', 'Burns', '1950', 'can', 'be', 'excused', 'really', 'was', 'New', 'York-dominated', 'decade', 'other', 'However', 'other', 'decades', 'did', 'fact', 'see', 'more', 'competitive', 'balance', 'one', 'would', 'not', 'get', 'impression', 'documentary.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'Burns', 'had', ""n't"", 'crammed', 'last', 'quarter', 'century', 'story', 'one', 'inning', 'Are', 'telling', 'stories', '1970', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'compelling', 'early', 'years', 'baseball', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Burns', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'devote', 'much', 'more', 'time', 'post-1970', 'era', 'make', 'feel', 'less', 'cursory', 'rushed', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'tendency', 'was', 'more', 'griveously', 'evident', 'when', 'made', 'Jazz', 'Also', 'get', 'little', 'tired', 'poetry', 'baseball', 'school', 'thought', ""n't"", 'am', 'knuckle-dragging', 'troglodyte', 'who', 'news', 'sports', 'radio', 'am', 'just', 'as', 'likely', 'go', 'opera', 'ballpark', 'baseball', 'metaphor', 'how', 'cosmos', 'nerves', 'while', 'consider', 'Roger', 'Angell', 'comment', 'more', 'Met', 'Yankee', 'be', 'priceless', 'description', 'not', 'baseball', ""n't"", 'imbue', 'life', 'little', 'extra', 'something', 'special', 'just', 'talking', 'heads', 'tend', 'get', 'little', 'overwrought.I', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'documentary', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'watched', 'probably', 'half', 'dozen', 'times', 'years', 'comparison', 'have', 'watched', 'Civil', 'War', '15', 'times', 'would', 'guess', 'was', 'so', 'disappointed', 'Jazz', 'managed', 'only', 'second', 'viewing', 'case', 'Baseball', 'very', 'entertaining', 'what', 'largely', '4-star', 'rating', 'would', 'only', 'caution', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'baseball', 'history', 'documentary', 'great', 'deal', 'what', 'very', 'good', 'story']",N/A

Having been born in Cincinnati and being surrounded with the likes of the Big Red Machine, one would think my awareness of the sport's rich history would be stronger.  For multiple reasons, it was just something I never focused on.Fortunately, my interest in history and PBS directed me to see Ken Burns' masterpiece.The music from each era and the colorful (and knowledgeable) commentators drew me in to a part of America with such significant history, that it could not have possibly been contained in a simple 2-hour movie.  I especially enjoyed the early history, describing how the game developed, how professional baseball was born in Cincinnati, the frenzy of Babe Ruth, and the impact of world events on it's operation.I often like to read the negative/one-star reviews (especially on items rated mostly positive by the majority).  One reviewer commented on Ken Burns' focus on the Negro Leagues and integration.  Well, I can't imagine a better opportunity to discuss the magnificent players often overlooked by history, not to mention the ugliness of segregation itself.  I'm certain there are young viewers who would otherwise have no idea about those great players who were never included in mainstream baseball.As mentioned earlier, the history of baseball is way too deep and complex, so despite the quality content included in this series, there are likely some who still feel much is left out.  You can't please everyone.My interest in baseball has steadily grown since first watching the series when it originally aired.  I for one, learned to appreciate baseball's nuances.  How it will always be an opportunity for a parent to bond with their child.  For me, there's nothing better than kicking back at a game with a buddy and a brew to enjoy America's pastime.

How many boring documentaries I have seen about this game I could not tell you.  What I can tell you is they all failed totally to come to grips with the scope of the subject.  Often they fall into hero worship, pointless personal reflections or (worst of all) statistics.To play down what some might overplay, to overplay what others ignored.  The coverage of the Negro leagues is what helps bring this home to me and says a lot about America over the years. The good, the overlooked and the ugly.One thing I have always liked about Ken's work is the strength of the audio.  Not in mixing or music but the sheer quality of writing. You can close your eyes at any point and you will not miss anything. The words of the past and of our time mix and become one long narrative that comes close to telling an impossible tale.

There are many interesting profiles of players and facts of each era. Every ""inning,"" about an hour-and-a-half covering the sport decade-by-decade, has fascinating material.I'll always be indebted to this series because it introduced me to, I think, the most interesting  era in baseball history: the Deadball Era.  Innings 2 and 3, in this set, were fantastic and covered that period. Since then, I have had many hours of great reading, learning about and enjoying the exploits of the great people who played from 1890-1919.It would be interesting to see this `Baseball' set updated and revised to include the strike in the mid '90s, its aftermath with the home run record-breakers and subsequent steroid scandal and, yes, the Red Sox finally winning it all - twice!",5,Especially Loved The 'Deadball Era' (Innings 2 & 3),1232323200,"01 19, 2009",2009,1053,"['appropriately', 'nine-part', 'series', 'history', 'baseball', 'up', '1990s', 'shown', 'PBS', 'done', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'latter', 'know', 'going', 'be', 'Liberal-bias', 'PC', 'just', 'put', 'up', 'Overall', 'well-done', 'must', 'baseball', 'fan', 'historian', 'are', 'many', 'interesting', 'profiles', 'players', 'facts', 'era', 'inning', 'hour-and-a-half', 'covering', 'sport', 'decade-by-decade', 'fascinating', 'material.I', ""'ll"", 'always', 'be', 'indebted', 'series', 'introduced', 'think', 'most', 'interesting', 'era', 'baseball', 'history', 'Deadball', 'Era', '2', '3', 'set', 'were', 'fantastic', 'covered', 'period', 'then', 'have', 'had', 'many', 'hours', 'great', 'reading', 'learning', 'enjoying', 'exploits', 'great', 'people', 'who', 'played', '1890-1919.It', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'Baseball', 'set', 'updated', 'revised', 'include', 'strike', 'mid', ""'90s"", 'aftermath', 'home', 'run', 'record-breakers', 'subsequent', 'steroid', 'scandal', 'yes', 'Red', 'Sox', 'finally', 'winning', 'twice']",N/A

37295,A28WJUJF6D2ULA,0780630459,Dai-keag-ity,"[7, 11]","In general I like Ken Burns' work, Baseball being no exception, but I have noticed a trend wherein with each new project Burns seems to allow greater and greater amounts of content oriented at an examination of minority participation in whatever aspect of history he is studying in a film, be it the Second World War, the life of Thomas Jefferson, or in the sport of baseball. Burns does this even when the disproportionate inclusion of tales of the minority experience becomes an intrusion, as it does in Baseball.Of course no feature about baseball in the United States would have been complete without the inclusion of the Negro League and its great teams like the Kansas City Monarchs (a true dynasty), or such masters as Satchel Paige (probably the greatest pitcher ever to stride onto a mound), or without some token segue into how baseball took root and flourished outside the United States (in Latin America and Japan especially). But was it seriously necessary to return again and again in mock-sociological fashion to segments on the experiences of black players, fans, coaches, teams? Yes, we all know inequality ran rampant in America's yesteryear, but is a film about our leading sport truly the venue to chronicle it ad nauseam? Frankly Ken Burns' efforts to bring retroactive equality soon grew sanctimoniously preachy, simplistically predictable, and above all boring!My opening comments (and all the unhelpful votes they're sure to garner me) aside, Baseball was long, slow-moving, and ultimately not as exciting as some other examinations of the national pastime I've seen. (ESPN has a series that blows PBS' Baseball out of the park.) Yet Ken Burns' Baseball was also encyclopedic, far-reaching, and it plumbed the archives of America's cultural memory for material to enhance this investigation of the sport. The commentary, much of it history-making and heartfelt, was truly an oral history achievement which will never be surpassed. Sadly, however, I think Burns aimed for quality in this project, and wound up with quantity as a substitute. A tighter ten-hour Baseball would likely have been every bit as informative and far less wasteful of time.I'll readily concede that overall Baseball is a worthy exercise in the documentation (if that word is appropriate for the visual medium) of a sport that has meaning to millions. I will also lodge what I am sure is not a singular complaint in adding that Baseball would have been a far more balanced and enjoyable film had it not drifted so often into issues regarding race. (Why in a society that alleges to aim for post-racial status should it be some sort of triumph that all the players on the 1971 Pittsburgh Pirates' starting lineup were the same race? Wasn't a team of all one race something Burns adamantly criticized in earlier episodes? A glaring double standard.) No history of baseball could have been complete without looking back at non-Caucasians who had their roles in the sport, but in Burns' heavy hands, things just got silly.Yes, Baseball is flawed but flaws are forgivable. If I stand by my criticisms of the things I cited in Baseball that disappointed me, I also stand by the fact that it is worthy of being called a monumental undertaking and one of the most impressive achievements in broadcasting.

For the first 2/3 of the show, I learned many wonderful things about the history of the game, and it's origins in and around New York. I appreciate those facts and gained new understanding of their significance. But by the time the 9th inning comes and goes, it becomes overwhelmingly apparent that Burn's is totally pre-occupied with NY and it's teams (present and past).But then their's always the 10th inning. A chance to bring about a semblance of the balance that has swept through baseball.  But again, New York, New York, with a dose of Boston thrown in, and then, nothing more. A wasted chance, a blown opportunity. .......A prime example of his obsession with all things New York: Three players who dominated their era, Ted Williams, Stan Musial and Joe DiMaggio, in that order. Ted Williams gets his well deserved due (although it could have been longer) and Stan the Man Musial gets a whole 20 or 30 seconds of precious time; but then the mighty Dimaggio, the GOD of Baseball. Or so they would have you believe. Both Williams and Musial are clearly superior players to Dimaggio in most any category you can think of, but the press hated Williams and ignored Musial. (Only the good old Brooklyn Dodger fans came to Musial's rescue, by giving him the nickname that defines him.) But neither of them married Marilyn Monroe or was so 'good looking and interesting off the field':  and so mainly on the basis of ONE baseball achievement, the hitting streak, Diammaggio is proclaimed the God of the era. That is a prime example of the emphasis on all things New York. If Dimaggio had played in St. Louis and Musial in New York, Dimaggio would only be known for the hitting streak, with little regard for anything else he accomplished. And while his accomphisments were very good, he still would be considered the third place player that he actually was to Williams and Musial.Based on that example and many others, I'd have to say I came away more than a little disappointed with the amazing lack of balance shown.

With background music in a slow tempo that often includes ""Take Me Out to the Ballgame,"" Burns shows us pictures of now old stadiums being built and great baseball players whose achievements and batting stances I knew by heart: ""Hammerin Hank"" Aaron, Duke Snyder, Ty Cobb, Harmon Killebrew, Ernie Banks, Al Kaline, Joltin' Joe Dimaggio, Lou Gehrig, Babe Ruth, Hank Greenberg, Ted Williams, Mel Ott, Jackie Robinson, Roger Hornsby, Whitey Ford, Bob Feller, Warren Spahn, Christie Mathewson, Tris Speaker, Roy Campanella, Roberto Clemente, Juan Marishall, Willie Mays, my favorite Mickey Mantle, and the oddball who would run to the sound of fire engines every time he heard the local alarm go off. These were giants we revered (all except the last one). We would know these names better than the characters of Shakespeare or other famous figures of history or science.We also learn about players we never heard of. The Philadelphia Phillies traded one to the (then) hapless New York Mets for a player to be named later. He was so bad that he was traded back to the Phils one month later, as the player named later. He became the only player in baseball history who was traded for himself. Then, there was that mug who chased fire engines.The series focuses on three teams at the expense of others, the wonderful New York Yankees, the hated Boston Red Sox (who still look like convicts), and the Brooklyn Dodgers. The first one is the team that most Americans love to hate except this one. The second were the hapless Sox who hadn't won a single World Series in four score and six years which was well within this production. There were the Trolley Dodgers who proudly referred to their team and themselves as ""the Bums,"" normally a gross insult in baseball. Each team saw their dynasties, their power players, their wins, and their disappointments. The Dodgers will never forget 1951, nor 1955, just as the people of Boston will still talk about the Series of 1976 and Carlton Fisk. The Yankees will remember Bill Mazerowski batting against them in Pittsburgh in 1960, but they will also remember Murderers Row, the Bronx Bombers, and the farewells of Gehrig, Ruth, and Mantle.Interviews with relative unknowns brought my childhood memories back from the dugout of my preconscious to a time when I wondered why every adult male didn't own a baseball glove. I felt the same sickness they mentioned wondering, hoping, praying that the nun or teacher would let us out early so we could run home to catch some of the World Series.  One interviewee, a former pitcher described how the players' rights allowed ""everyone"" to profit, the players as well as the owners, but that was not exactly true. Someone always has to lose, and it was the fans who paid, and have ever since which makes the family trip to the park on Sunday afternoon a virtual thing of the past.""Baseball"" is a classic that will be one of the finest stories of our national pastime. What makes this so worth buying is that you can take out any DVD and enjoy watching it again and again. It's even cheaper than going to a, well, baseball game.You're safe at home with this one.For my great grandfather, Joe ""Ubbo"" Hornung, major league baseball player, 1879-1890.Opening Day, 2009: The average cost of a ticket at the new Yankee Stadium is $76.00.

The major players and their towns are studied. Quotes are read, fans talk, and pictues are shown.As the times pass we get to see film footage.  There are two basic issues that are the main characters of the story.  The first is the integration of baseball.  The Negro Leagues are studied, then, in 1947 Jackie Robinson breaks the color barrier with the Brooklyn Dodgers.From there it is a celebration of baseball, it appears that baseball did help in race relations.The next big issue is the reserve clause, which means a player is essentially owned by a club until he is released. The Cardinale traded Curt Flood to the lowly Phillies, he said he would not go.  Eventually he signed with the Washington Senators.In the 1970's Andy Messersmith played a year without a contract and that brought about free agency.But, by the 1980's owners were convicted of collusion for not signing players so they had to pay a fine.The 10th Inning deals mostly with the result of the 1994 Strike in which the players got nothing.  It enraged fans and they no longer supported the Expos, the team had to move to Washington D.C., which had already lost two previous teams.The second topic is steroids and Barry Bonds and his chase of Henry Aaron's 755 home runs.

It took me a couple years to finally get around to  watching the series, and I can not believe how Ken Burns botched a golden  opportunity to tell the story properly.To be sure, there are many  commendable segments.  But there are also too many sore thumbs that stick  out too much.  Let's start with the political bias that permeates this  series, just in terms of the talking heads (Gould, Goodwin, Terkel) and  then we are subjected to reams of stuff about Mario Cuomo's forgettable  minor league career.  It just so happens that there are two members of  Congress, both U.S. Senators, with stronger connections to the game than  Mario Cuomo.  One is Jim Bunning, a Hall of Fame pitcher who won 100 games  in both leagues and threw a perfect game, the other is Connie Mack,  grandson of one of the all time great managers.  But both of them alas,  happen to be conservative Republicans, which perhaps accounts for why they  were deemed less significant than Mario Cuomo.Finally, there is Burns's  obsession with depicting players in the best light in their labor struggles  all the way up to the present.  This is valid in the early days, but to see  this go on into the greed-obsessed 80s is where Burns loses me completely.  He devotes several minutes to the owners collusion scandal of 1986 to show  how terrible the owners are, yet he devotes not one second to the players  strikes of 1972, 1981 and 1985 which were far more significant events and  raised questions about whether players have abused their privilege of free  agency.And another thing to Burns, regarding his obsession with Bill  Lee.

Outstanding insights into what has made our National Pasttime into The Greatest Game On Earth.The series is filled with information including incredibly old and occasionally obscure footage  (which may explain some of the criticism regarding the unevenness) was  wonderfully informative.  Takes the viewer places where neither Total  Baseball nor the Baseball Encyclopedia ever could: Seeing footage of Babe  Ruth (in and out of the House he built) helps explain his impact on the  game.  &quot;Shadowball&quot; is a most fascinating exploration of the  injustice which surrounded the Negro Leagues (and the entirety of the  race).  And quotes from the President of Harvard railing against the  deception of Candy Cummings' invention (the curve ball) show just one the  eternal quandries of the game.Even the occasional valid criticisms don't  take away from the scope of Ken Burns' work.  Sure, there is an emphasis on  New York, but as Burns so aptly noted, it was the Capital of Baseball.  Unless the series was expanded to 162 parts from nine (maybe we could call  each one a &quot;game&quot; rather than an &quot;inning&quot;), some  players were going to get the short end of the stick.

37310,A11UDE5XOHMRA3,0780630459,George E. Duffy Jr.,"[0, 0]","I saw some of this on PBS and on the MLB network, so as a baseball fan, I couldn't wait to get this set.  Got this for christmas.  From the beginning at 1840 thru 1979, it was awesome to watch! Loved every minute of it.  Talked about the game, the players, quote from players and interviews from various people.  True history of the game.  Few times I thought they would forget something but they came back to it, so don't worry if you think they are forgetting something.  Only 1 minor thing I was disappointed in and that was the 1968 World Series between the Cardinals against the Tigers.  Other WS they talked about both teams and their players and how they got to Oct.  For some reason, they didn't mention a lot about the Cardinals, mostly about Bob Gibson.  Not much about the Tigers at all which surprised me.  When you read about it, they talk of the big match up of the Mighty Bob Gibson against Danny Mclain who won a whopping 30 games!  How rare is a 30 game winner?  Well, they didn't mention McLain at all or much about the Tigers outside of them striking out against Gibson.  I couldn't figure that out.  When they got to the 70's, they seem to bypass many things.  Longest WS they talked about was 1971 and 1975.  The rest, they seem to skim thru a bit.  Earlier, they talked about everything about the game and the people involved and still gave an detail info of the World Series and the teams and their players.  Most of the 70's they skim thru the WS details.  When they got to the 80's, they did talked about the game but they skipped most the WS and the teams.  They briefly mentioned the Phillies winning in 1980 but don't say against who and the next WS they talked about was 1986.  How could they skip the rest?  Especially the Tigers finally winning with domination in 1984 or a sub 500 team Twins winning the WS the next year in 1987?  Not to mention The Brewers in their first WS in 1982 but losing to the Cardinals and the Royals winning their first and only WS in 1985.  They skipped all of that.  They didn't mention much of the WS in 1989, mostly about the Earthquake during the series.  It's kinda like they were rushing a bit, while earlier years they were taking their time telling what was going on.  As I mentioned about the 70's, they sort of skim thru the A's Dominance.  Oh, they told a bit about the team but not like they should have.  Before the A's of the early 70's, the last team to win 3 WS in a row was back in the 50's.  Just puzzled me.  One person called it a NY Baseball set.  I can kinda understand how he could think that, they did talk equally of different teams and players, but I admit, it was the NY teams that was talked about the most.  However, you have to remember, up thru the 1950s, MLB didn't have a lot of teams, only like about 8 teams in both leagues and NY had 3 teams they dominated most of the years and there was no playoffs except for teams that had gone down the wire.  I have 2 discs left to go, called The 10th Inning, from 1992 to 2009.  Since this period came later on after the set had already come out, I am hoping for a better job.

This man realizes that race is the issue that stands at the heart of America's soul... it is the issue the shapes so much of our lives in ways we may not even realize.  I understand if many may not want to hear this perspective, but if you shake Ken Burns, race is what comes out.  In my studies of American history, it is the issue that comes up again and again.I do wish there are some things he could have done differently with ""Baseball.""  Some of his pictures did not match with their respective narratives.  Civil War historian Shelby Foote seemed really out of place in this series but he had great stories and besides... why can't he be a baseball fan? And as a native of DC, I wish he could have included more on the Washington Senators' story- a film clip of ""Damn Yankees,"" and the story of how the Senators were bought by Bob Short in 1968 and the story of their final game on September 30, 1971, which ended as a forfeit because fans stormed the field in protest.  I would have loved to have seen something on the '83 World Series with the Orioles.  But I think Burns did a pretty decent job with the material he had.  Every story could not be told and he did a great job covering the important ones.  Perhaps my favorite moment of this series is where writer Gerald Early talks about when he played the game as a kid and he and his friends did everything they saw done in the professional game, and on their own, they would sing the National Anthem.  What a heartwarming story!I'm really glad for the work of Ken Burns and his understanding of the issues that get to the heart of our society.PS- Ken Burns sometimes uses the wrong pic or video clip with a given subject.  But even with that, I still do mot umderstand why, during Episode 8, ""A Whole New Ballgame: 1960-69,"" during the Roger Maris segment, he showed Maris hitting a home run and the next thing you see is a homer going into THE WRIGLEY FIELD BLEACHERS!

The combination of period photographs with well-composed (or well-selected) narratives, performed at times by actors, and overlaid with music, often also of the period, or vintage recordings is amazingly simple but just as amazingly powerful. The same holds true for this wonderful history of the evolution of America's signature game, one unlike any other.The love for baseball by the various commentators and interviewees is clear and palpable. From their recounting of grand events in baseball history to their earliest recollections of catch in the yard with their father, the overreaching theme is love for the game in all its forms. The history of baseball is presented from its pre-American Revolution days to its final evolution in New York (and carried out on the Elesian Fields in New Jersey), followed by its spread thanks to the Civil War and the creation of professional leagues, the film really takes off once the heroic names of unmatched heroes of the game begin to take the spotlight from the pastoral game of children to the national headline-making stories that persist to the present day. From the scandals of gambling and world series-fixing, to the ascent of the live-ball era with Babe Ruth's delivery of entertainment via the home run. From the tenacity and grit of Ty Cobb to the hard working labors of Pete Rose. From the glory and tragedy of Lou Gehrig to the pursuit of the Iron Horse's record by Cal Ripken, Jr. The gamut of baseball history is run, and brought closer to the present with Burns' successor episodes of The Tenth Inning, which show the resurgent dominance of the Yankees and the eventual return to championship form of other long-dormant franchises like the Tigers and Phillies.The only complaint I have with this set of discs is the poor sound-mixing. As I have encountered with some other Burns' films, the DVD sets have the music mixed too loud on the soundtrack, often completely drowning out the narrative that it is supposed to accent. The issue utterly defies my attempts to modulate the track with my sound system, often forcing me to rely on the far-from-perfect subtitles to get at least an inkling of the passages being read or the observations of historians being overridden. The subtitles are inaccurate, attempting to convey the overall intent of the speaker instead of presenting the actual words transcribed and allowing the viewer to do so for him- or herself.I recommend the set for anyone who loves baseball and wants the most comprehensive video presentation of its history.

Because of this, Ken Burns has decided to use the history of baseball as a vehicle for one of his sanctimonious sermons - in this case, civil rights - just as he did with the Civil War and has done with Jazz.  The struggle for racial equality is an element of the baseball story, but it is not the baseball story.The ripoff here is seen in the black players who are interviewed.  Burns elicits only half-hearted testimony that, yes, there was discrimination and, yes, it's good that the black leagues are extinct, thanks to Jackie Robinson and his successors.  It would be a crime against Burns's political correctess to say anything else, but it's not that hard to see through the cant, for it is obvious that these players loved oplaying the game, regardless of where they played.  But Burns disingenuously tries to portray them as the miserable victims of a plantation culture.If you really want to puke, just try to get through Burns's attempt to make baseball a struggle for *gender* equality!Burns flogs sentiment for every drop he can extract.  How many times must we hear the Star Spangled Banner or Take Me Out to the Ball Game rendered as variations on a hymn?  How often must we feel ourselves being manipulated by the slow, stately, pretentious narration?  If we didn't understand English, we would be hard pressed to say, by the narration alone, whether we're listening to Ken Burns's version of the Civil War or Baseball.But there is a big difference between warfare and a non-contact game (unless you define baseball by Ty Cobb) and, though Burns would have us think otherwise, a game is just a game.

For those who love baseball it is obvious why they will love it. Ken Burns does his usual outstanding work in telling the story of baseball from its history to the people who played it. There is certainly alot of ground to cover in telling the story about the game going back to the 1840's. Just about every important development of the game to the great feats accomplished on the playing field by the greatest of players to ever walk up to the plate or the pitchers mound is noted here. For todays baseball fans this will certainly introduce them to the game that was played 100 years ago and how it is really true that the old saying is right, ""The more Things Change The More They Stay The Same"". It also shows that for all the great scandels that have occurred throughout the history of baseball the game has the ability to bounce back and overcome its lowest points from the ""Black Sox"" scandel of 1919 to the steroids epidemic of the 2000's. Its crowning moment to me is when it tells all the behind the scene development that took place with Branch Rickey and Jackie Robinson as the ground work was put in place to end the segregation of baseball. ""Baseball"" also gives a great and detailed account of the old Negro Baseball League. This is certainly not a portion of the documentary to be missed.But you don't have to like baseball to still fall in love and enjoy this documentary. There is more to this film then baseball. There is history and geography as well. For anyone who is a history buff ""Baseball"" will show just how baseball could effect the course of history. An excellant example is of course the intergration of baseball in 1947. Almost 2 decades before the signing of the equal rights amendment in 1964 baseball showed it was way ahead of the rest of America in bringing equality to the country. But history had a way of bringing the world to the major leagues as well and affecting baseball. An excellant example of that would be during the first and second World Wars. As millions of young American men marched off to war baseball saw many of their players, including some of the biggest players of the game, put down their bats and pick up a rifle and help defend their country. There are many other examples. Too numerious to get into. The point though is as big a game as baseball has become all over the world there is no way that events that occur outside of the baseball diamond won't affect the game inside of the diamond and visa versa.This is a strong recommendation to anyone whether a baseball fan or not this is something you should watch. It is entertaining and educational all at the same time.

Each video in the set is divided into innings, with a top and bottom half.  Burns begins his study back in the 1870s and continues through the present day.  All of the classic moments are captured here; from the great Ty Cobb, Rogers Hornsby, and Honus Wagner to modern day heroes such as Ken Griffey Jr., Tony Gwynn, and Cal Ripken, Jr.  The Black Sox scandal of 1919 is told in great detail, and the great teams of the 30s and 40s are described as well. Perhaps the greatest World Series ever, the 1975 Red Sox-Reds classic, comes to life in this video, too.  Burns devotes 1 tape to the great Babe Ruth and the impact he made on the game.  Burns points out that Ruth hit more home runs in a season by himself than many TEAMS did collectively.Using excellent still photos and real game footage, Burns brings the game of baseball to life as only he can.

It has trivial information such as team name origins, but also takes a critical look at how the game evolved over time by analyzing team owners, players unions, free agency and all the other modern issues that jeopardize the integrity of the game.  Baseball always has, and unfortunately always will have its controversies, but then so do all other sports or all other elements of our popular culture, so we must be willing to accept, try to improve, then move on.  The Black Sox scandal is but one example of the troubles baseball has endured.  But people always come back to the game.  Baseball is so engrained in our mindsets and culture that no evil can overcome its appeal.Most true fans long for the days of Babe Ruth and pre-free agency loyalty, but those days are gone forever.  People may say free agency ruined baseball, but then would those same people also be willing to go back to the days of serfdom and feudalism?  Baseball now has its steriod controversy.  When owners realize the need for more and more revenue and players realize natural talent should be preferred over drug-enhanced skills, then baseball will be a better sport.  Burns' film speaks to this altruism and how this wonderful sport became so deeply entrenched in our culture.  Winning can't always be everything, but money seems to dictate another conclusion to that statement.People who watch this film will see a film that embraces baseball with all its might.  The episodes are a bit long, but then a baseball game has no predetermined end, either.

I've since purchased the collection on VHS and have watched it once almost every year since.Ken Burns weaves a wonderful tapestry of nostalgia, emotion, photographs, newsreels and personal reflections into the history of 20th-Century America through the lens of baseball.  The American Pastime mirrors the social changes of our country - good and bad - and Burns demonstrates this throughout.Burns probably needs to be forgiven for his 'obsession' with Babe Ruth and Jackie Robinson.  While both figures are dominant in the broadcasts, the stories are indeed moving and I remember shedding several tears during the original telecast during these sequences.  The New York and Boston teams are emphasized - which is fine; it would be impossible to encapsulate all of the rich history of baseball on just nine tapes or discs.  Although a strong Cardinals fan, I didn't feel 'slighted.'  Ken Burns is from the East Coast, anyway, so it's entirely understandable that his historical emphasis would reflect this.To me, the highlights are the rare newsreel footage of both  Ruth and Robinson, the priceless reflections from Buck O'Neil, the perspectives from Dan Okrent, the 'Black Sox' Scandal, and the simultaneous interweaving of the Negro Leagues with the Major Leagues.  Burns has a tendency to make political points (at the expense of improving the production) in subtle and overt ways.  The only color footage shown in the production prior to the 1960's is that of the Negro Leagues and Ladies' Professional Leagues.  I can't believe that that wasn't deliberate - I'm sure that Burns had access to historic color footage of the Major Leagues, but chose not to incorporate it.Overall, however, this set is a wonderful collection for the baseball fan of all ages - very intelligent and very moving.",5,A moving history of the National Pastime,1141603200,"03 6, 2006",2006,1865,"['remember', 'watching', 'television', 'when', 'first', 'aired', '1994', ""'ve"", 'purchased', 'collection', 'VHS', 'have', 'watched', 'once', 'almost', 'year', 'since.Ken', 'Burns', 'wonderful', 'tapestry', 'nostalgia', 'emotion', 'photographs', 'newsreels', 'personal', 'reflections', 'history', '20th-Century', 'America', 'lens', 'baseball', 'American', 'Pastime', 'mirrors', 'social', 'changes', 'country', 'good', 'bad', 'Burns', 'probably', 'needs', 'be', 'forgiven', ""'obsession"", 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'figures', 'are', 'dominant', 'broadcasts', 'stories', 'are', 'indeed', 'moving', 'remember', 'shedding', 'several', 'tears', 'original', 'telecast', 'sequences', 'New', 'York', 'Boston', 'teams', 'are', 'emphasized', 'fine', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'encapsulate', 'rich', 'history', 'baseball', 'just', 'nine', 'tapes', 'discs', 'strong', 'Cardinals', 'fan', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', ""'slighted"", 'Ken', 'Burns', 'East', 'Coast', 'anyway', 'entirely', 'understandable', 'historical', 'emphasis', 'would', 'reflect', 'highlights', 'are', 'rare', 'newsreel', 'footage', 'Ruth', 'Robinson', 'priceless', 'reflections', 'Buck', ""O'Neil"", 'perspectives', 'Dan', 'Okrent', ""'Black"", 'Sox', 'Scandal', 'simultaneous', 'interweaving', 'Negro', 'Leagues', 'Major', 'Leagues', 'Burns', 'tendency', 'make', 'political', 'points', 'expense', 'improving', 'production', 'subtle', 'overt', 'ways', 'only', 'color', 'footage', 'shown', 'production', 'prior', '1960', 'Negro', 'Leagues', 'Ladies', 'Professional', 'Leagues', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', ""n't"", 'deliberate', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Burns', 'had', 'access', 'historic', 'color', 'footage', 'Major', 'Leagues', 'chose', 'not', 'incorporate', 'it.Overall', 'however', 'set', 'wonderful', 'collection', 'baseball', 'fan', 'ages', 'very', 'intelligent', 'very', 'moving']",N/A

Overlong with not enough action and everyone around you yapping how owners, players and fans have ruined the game.The documentary does become fascinating with disk nine's coverage of the Red Sox curse. You can see the pain on the faces of the fans as they discuss Bucky Dent's home run or the game six tale of how they had to remove the campaign and plastic sheeting from the Red Sox locker room. This segment also highlights the strength of using non-experts to discuss the game they love. It is quite refreshing.On the bad side, outside of the sheer length, is the constant drumbeat about racism in the game. While Burn's Jazz miniseries and certainly the Civil War had a place to discuss racism, it starts to seem out of place here. There is not a disk or a segment that escapes the constant barrage of how racist baseball was and is.

I am watching it anew in 2009 after buying the DVD set.I'm afraid baseball fans in decades to come will be repeating Charlie Rose's question to themselves. Given the resources available to Burns and crew, one is left to ponder why he spent so much valuable time of the documentary addressing the 'race' question, to the exclusion of a lot of wonderful baseball history which is just not here or is barely touched on.For instance,the Miracle Braves of 1914 get just a passing remark. Not even a photo of Rabbit Maranville.The exclusions are numerous...too numerous to catalog here.What is sad is that now, in 2009, so many of the players who were ready willing and able to appear in interviews in 1994 are no longer on this mortal coil. Future baseball documentarians will mourn the loss of their voices to the exclusion of Burns' airing out his liberal white guilt at the rampant racism of past generations.  I certainly share his views but I feel he could have done the sport of baseball and we fans a much greater service by devoting less time to assuaging white liberal guilt and more time to the lovely history available to him at that time. No other professional sport in America has such a vast well of history and lore to draw on. He largely bypassed this to give us his view of what was wrong with society in the years gone by.Certainly the story of Jackie Robinson needed to be told and is done so magnificently, as is the tales of black players who followed him.As a baseball fan I would expect a huge series like this to  concentrate on the major leagues. Burns' film veers off to cover the Negro leagues exhaustively, which is a valuable niche history subject, but no more so than the minor leagues or Cuban baseball or other niche areas of baseball history...areas just barely mentioned herein, and rightly so.I'm left with a sense of disappointment over what 'could have been' and I think future historians will view this series and wonder ""Why the heck did he make a documentary about racism and call it 'Baseball'?""With that said, it is a great series..better than just about any other thus far made.  I hope someone will go back and fill in the gaps that Burns left out.---------------------------------------------------------------------------On the interview disc there is a truly wonderful interview of Bob Costas by Charlie Rose conducted Oct 22, 1998 at first base in Busch Stadium, St. Louis.  This is right after Mark McGwire had hit 70 home runs.Costas gushes on & on about how great McGwire is--in vast contrast to how he is now held in contempt.  Rose asks Costas if McGwire's use of performance enhancing drugs makes any difference and Costas poo-poos it.Costas tells Rose the 70 HR mark will last for years and years. It actually lasted 3.In contrast, they then discuss the 1998 Yankees who had just swept the Padres and are now considered by many the best team ever to play the game. Costas feels the Yankees will have trouble getting near the World Series again.  In fact they made it back in '99, 2000, 2001 and 2003. This interview alone is almost worth the price of the set.Other interviews are with Yogi Berra, Bob Gibson, Rachel Robinson (widow of Jackie) and another with Costas the day after he eulogized Mickey Mantle.  Great stuff!-----------------------------------------------------------------------I'm from the South, and down here we have a personality type:  kindly, gentile, courtly, gentle old men who are called 'storytellers' by those who enjoy their stories and 'windbags' by those who tire of the endless tales packaged with an effort to charm the listener.In his Civil War series Shelby Foote of Memphis serves this role, and is give more air time than any other talking head. In this Baseball series it's kindly old Buck O'Neil, who spent most of his life in the Negro leagues and then later as a major league scout.I suppose Burns, being from the North, had not run across these types of 'storytellers' and was charmed by them--to the exclusion of other voices.Personally, I would have preferred less O'Neil and more from former MLB players.Years ago I had season tickets to a MLB team. These were behind the backstop and a frequent seatmate was Rube Walker who was a MLB scout. As a Brookyn Dodger, he was behind the plate when Bobby Thomson hit the ""Shot Heard 'Round the World"" in 1951.Guys like that are no longer with us. I wish he had been interviewed--and more like him-----with less Buck O'Neil.",3,Could Have Been Much More,1234051200,"02 8, 2009",2009,4797,"['Charlie', 'Rose', 'interview', 'Ken', 'Burns',

This series is very deliberately paced, so slow, but it more than makes up for this with a wide, berth of facts. I was very surprised at how patriotic it made me feel, our sport our country our boys(unless you are black, sorry). it is both engrossing, and enraging to see the people get rich off the players, and then use the players up and toss em out, while at the same time telling the minorities, that they were not allowed to join in the national past time. The fans seem to be sympathetic to the players cries of foul, but with the ""Black Sox"" scandal and eventually free agency, the fans saw the duality of professional sports, they don't want cheating, no matter how little you make, and they want you to stay in 1 city forever, again no matter how badly you are treated. By the time the Dodgers and Giants leave New York the end was in sight. Now the players make millions as do the owners, but the game is just a shell of what it once was to this country. sad, but also a part of life.  Very Good!!!!  Also some people seem to think Burns spends too much time on ""issues"" and not enough on the sport, or that it is too NY Boston, centered. to the 1st group, grow up it is 22 hrs long, and stuff happened in America that needs to be brought up for context, Sorry you learned about documentaries from Micheal Moore, to the NY/Boston people, I hate those 2 cities, especially their sports fans, but they do seem to be in every other Series at the time, sooooo it seems justified. I say watch and Enjoy!btw  even Documentaries have themes, and it is obvious that this 1 centered around new yorkers, and it is FINE to dislike that, but it seems to be a long project made by, for and with people who love baseball.  Also Ken Burns is a BIG TIME Democrat, so he thinks NY IS America, but that shouldn't ruin this for you.

37344,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0780630459,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[61, 62]","Every spring I watch Ken Burns' celebrated documentary &quot;Baseball&quot; on the weekend of Opening Day.  Even if I am not sitting glued to the tube while it is on, listening to John Chancellor tell the story of the game is an enjoyable experience.  Each &quot;inning&quot; takes on a specific focus, providing a defining element in the way Ty Cobb played the game, the Black Sox Scandal, the way Babe Ruth played the game, the struggle of the Negro Leagues, the dominance of New York temas in the Fifties, the creation of Free Agency, etc.  Concise profiles of many of the game's greatest players and managers are spread throughout the nine volumes.  More importantly, virtually every great moment in the history of the sport is to be found, not to mention some wonderful old-fashioned baseball songs.Clearly, the climax of the documentary comes in Inning 6, &quot;The National Pastime,&quot; when Jackie Robinson starts playing for the Dodgers.  The series begins with a prologue on Ebbets Field and Robinson is laid to rest in the final episode.  While the focus is on the Major Leagues throughout, Burns always checks back in with what is happening with the black players and the Negro Leagues, building towards Robinson breaking the color barrier.  I think it is fair to say the documentary loses some steam after that point, but then that is the point where the series gets to players and moments that overlap our own lifetime.  Once we get to colored images from television there is a different feel to &quot;Baseball&quot; from the black &amp; white images to which we have become accustomed.Also, the more you know about the history of baseball the more you will see the glaring omissions.  Stan Musial is the obvious example cited by other reviewers, but he is eclipsed in the episodes covering the 40's and 50's by Jackie Robinson and the New York teams, just as he was during his career.

I got the DVD set for Christmas.I have several gripes.Ken Burns had several living baseball greats he could have interviewed. Williams, DiMaggio, Banks, Mantle, Koufax, Mays, Rose, Tiant, Gibson, Yogi, Earl Weaver, Frank Robinson, Henry Aaron etc. These guys would have provided entertainment and insight. People who were there. Instead, Burns chooses to interview a bunch of people who have nothing to do with the game. Doris Kerns Goodwin? Mario Cuomo? Shelby Foote? Arthur Ashe? Really?Two former players are interviewed at length. Curt Flood goes on and on about how he was mistreated. Then there is Bill Lee. He is wearing a hat with CCCP on it. Nice touch comrade.At every single juncture, Burns goes off on America's racist past. Baseball was a leader in integration. There were blacks playing along side whites long before the US Supreme court had a black judge. Long before the integration of the Boston public schools. Long before the country had a black President.....After pounding the racist thing into the ground, he goes after the history of baseball's unfair labor practices. He gives Marvin Miller an extended forum to pontificate but fails to talk to a single owner or commissioner.Being a life long Red Sox fan, I'll forgive the biased over-coverage that Ken gives them.I do have two questions for Ken Burns.1. How integrated is your neighborhood up there in the sticks? Walpole, New Hampshire is 98.3 % white according to the most recent census.Here's a link from Ken's own site. [...]Check out the group photograph. See any black faces?2. Is your tax funded movie company ""Florentine films"" a union shop? Who keeps the lion's share of the profits?

You don't have to watch them all and you don't have to watch in the chronological order they were produced but once you start it is hard to stop. Even those who may consider themselves marginal baseball fans can enjoy this amazing series. Baseball is so much a part of the history of our country since it began in the 1850's - yes, that's right they played baseball during the Civil War. Sometimes it reflects our culture (racial discrimination until Jackie Robinson) and sometimes it creates culture (hundreds of leagues at all ages playing the game in the beginning). Nobody does documentaries about our life in America better than Ken Burns and he is at his best with BASEBALL. He does a great job of bringing in political and cultural influences on the sport. The sport of baseball and particularly professional baseball does not exist in a vacuum and is subject to the same outside influences as any other institution in America. And, yes, there really was some good in the 'good old days' but there was also a lot that needed fixing and you will experience both during this series. As someone who once stood countless times along the chalk baseline in a straight row with teammates and sang the National Anthem waiting to hear the umpire say 'let's play ball', I can honestly say this is a priceless story of the game of baseball. Thanks, Ken Burns, for helping all of us understand why baseball is America's pastime and so much a part of American life. And for all those whose overly efficient mothers threw out their boxes of baseball cards when they went away to college, this is for you. And for all those sisters (I know at least four) who had to watch hundreds of their brothers' games growing up, this may help you to understand why he was so passionate about the game.

For a baseball fan who doesn't mind the film's devotion to teams of New York it's a slice of heaven.It's futile to condense 18 hours of screentime into a few paragraphs, but it's worthwhile to note a few things I feel are wonderful about the film.The entire opening ""inning"" (the film is divided into 9 segments of 2 hours each) is devoted to the origins of the game - both as a game, then as a game played for money.  The widely held misconception that Abner Doubleday ""invented"" baseball is taken apart immediately.Burns spends a lot of time documenting the historical and social context of where America was as a country at the same time events were occurring on the diamond.  In that way he presents the perspective that baseball's single greatest moment was the day Jackie Robinson walked onto Ebbett's Field with ""Dodgers"" across his chest.  It's useful for us as people to not only appreciate the baseball achievements of Jackie Robinson and, later, players such as Willie Mays and Hank Aaron, but also to acknowledge the widespread racism and outright barriers they had to overcome that their white counterparts didn't even have to consider.He similarly contrasts virtuous players with non-virtuous ones.  In inning two the film triumphantly reports the victory of mild-mannered Honus Wagner's Pirates over hated Ty Cobb's Tigers.It's a little disconcerting how little time is allocated to recent years - most ""innings"" cover a decade, but the most recent 24 years of baseball (1970-1994) are covered in a single disc.  Since that is the time most of us are most familiar with it's easy to feel a little slighted.If you think baseball is just ""some game"" this film is clearly not aimed at you.

It protrays the history of baseball as the great pastoral American pastime as portrayed in &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;. As historial documentation, though, Burns films fall a bit short.The problems is that wherther he's filming baseball, the Civil War,  Jazz or whatever, Burns' method is to take an era or a theme he may not know much about, find one person or theme that strikes him as central, and use that person or persons as the central theme to build his story around. He also tends to pick one &quot;authority&quot; to tell his story, and he's not always a terribly good judge of who to choose. The result is good storytelling, but  not very good history. In the case of &quot;Jazz&quot; it was Louis Armstrong, and in the case of of &quot;Baseball&quot; it's Jackie Robinson. Both important figures (Armstrong especially so) but in both cases he missed important parts of the big story by spending so much time with his favorite character.Like all Burns' films, &quot;Baseball&quot; is a wonderful collection of images that will delight the fan and at the same time infuriate the knowledgeable viewer.

Innings 1 through 9 debuted on September 18, 1994 and Inning 10 debuted on September 28, 2010. This is an extensive piece of work starting around the 1840s and ending in 2009. It covers the origins of the game, the different leagues through the years, the barring of black players, the famous Black Sox Scandal, some of the greatest and not so great plays in the history of the game. It also covers some of the greatest World Series games as well. People like Ted Williams, Mickey Mantle, Bill Lee, Joe Torre, Ichiro and Pedro Martinez give some insights about the game. Innings 1 through 9 does a great job of a chronological history of the game. When you get to Inning 10 however, it tends to jump around a bit and Inning 10 is the only one to have two discs devoted to it as well as bonus features.

37357,A33B95YJJFVJCE,0780630459,Michael Stephens,"[12, 19]","Disappointed with this DVD series compared to Burns' Civil War.  The race/integration card was played to the hilt before AND after Jackie Robinson's debut.  That was the overriding issue of each ""inning"" of this game.  It was an appropriate topic in his Civil War documentary but garnered WAY TOO MUCH coverage here.  There was also a strong emphasis on the New York and Boston baseball history.  MOST of the guests interviewed were either New York/Boston fans (Crystal, Goodwin, Barber, Scully, etc.) or black writers and athletes.  Actually my favorite was Buck O'Neil, he wasn't bitter and stated not to feel sorry for him, ""I had my baseball career"".  They did point out that once integration took place the Negro Leagues died and were no more.There were a few positives:1) I have a greater appreciation for what Jackie Robinson (really Branch Rickey) accomplished and what he had to go through to do it.2) I learned the amazing stat that Ty Cobb over his 24 year career and more than 11,000 at bats struck out only 357 times.  Only 2 players (Cap Anson and Tris Speaker) with more than 10,000 at bats had a better record than that.NEGATIVES:Besides the race/integration card being overplayed, as a Detroit Tiger fan, we got short changed as usual.  Ty Cobb was covered quite a bit but his being a jerk and a racist was made clear.  Hank Greenberg was covered because he was Jewish and played in the World War II era.  After that NOTHING!  No Al Kaline, no Ernie Harwell, nothing.Ernie Harwell is the biggest slight of all.  One of the most knowledgeable and beloved people in baseball history and he wasn't even interviewed and I doubt he would have turned it down if he was asked.Al Kaline would have been only the 4th player (after Aaron, Mays, Musial) in major league history at the time to have 400+ home runs and 3000+ hits but he hit a home run in a rain shortened game and it didn't count.  5 other players have done it since.1968 Season and World Series.  The Year of the Tigers:  No mention of Denny McLain's 31 victories which was unheard of and unprecedented by the time the 60's came around (the only player to win 30 since 1934).  Only 14 times has a pitcher won more than 25 games in a season since 1934, 3 times by a Tiger (Hal Newhouser twice and Dizzy Trout) and only 2 times by a New York pitcher.  The most victories in a season between 1934 and 1968 was 29 by Hal Newhouser, a TIGER, in 1944.No mention that the Tigers won 40 games that year after the 7th inning and 30 in their last time at bat.  No mention that the Tigers WON the World Series after trailing 3 games to 1, only the 3rd time in Series history (they made a big deal about the 1979 Pirates coming back from being down 3-1, it was a minority-laden team).  They didn't mention how much the 1968 Tigers meant to a race torn city like Detroit a year after 43 were killed in the 1967 race riot in which Willie Horton (a black player) after a ball game drove to the riot area and stood on a car in the middle of the crowd while he was still wearing his uniform. However, despite his impassioned pleas to his people, he could not calm the mob.  Horton, Gates Brown and Earl Wilson were three very important black players on that team.  AND Mickey Lolich outdueled and outpitched Bob Gibson in Game 7 for the Champions, Lolich's 3rd victory of the series.It played the race card again when Aaron broke Ruth's record reading quotes from 2 letters he supposedly received from angry ""white"" people I guess.

Some of the pictures and videos contained within are simply remarkable.  You will often find yourself saying where did he come up with these pictures and videos.  You almost wish you were there re-living the events.  I particularly loved the story of the Negro leagues and the struggles that African Americans went through to make it in the big leagues.  Certain sections of the story really make you want to cry, and yet others really make you laugh too.  You will learn a whole new perspective of baseball's history here.  My only complaint with this documentary is not what Ken Burns focuses on here, but what he DOESN'T focus on.  Granted, New York is probably the biggest baseball market in the country, and you can't give an accurate account of baseball without discussing New York, but there is a lot of rich baseball history outside of ""The Big Apple"" and the New England area.  Yes, you have to tell the Babe Ruth story, but do you have to go in depth about Fred Merkle and Fred Snodgrass and ""The Daffiness Boys""???  Why not tell the story of Gaby Harnett's famous Homerun In The Darkness at Wrigley Field that won the pennant for The Cubs instead???  Why not tell the story of Pittsburgh's Big Poison and Little Poison???  So many of baseball's greats got little more than a brief mention here.  Stan ""The Man"" Musial wasn't even mentioned until the 8th inning as I recall.  Detroit's Al Kaline who had a 20-year career in the big leagues didn't even get a mention, nor did Lou Brock, nor did one of the greatest hitters of all-time, Minnesota's Rod Carew.  Why not cover other important issues too...why did he not go into the fight about keeping the lights out of Wrigley Field???  The Wrigley residents took their fight all the way to the State Supreme Court as I recall before the Tribune Company finally won the right to install lights.  But instead he goes in depth about the early days of the New York Mets....who cares???  Granted, he needed to talk about Casey Stengel's managerial days with The Yankees, but did he need to talk about his days with the Mets???

That word is far too broad for what we get to see.Let's look at one installment: ""Inning 8: 1960-1970"".Point One: There must be very little baseball history in the midwest U.S. because ""Baseball"" tells very little from it.  This must be mentioned as a disclaimer.  However, there are stories from the midwest that should never be overlooked.  For example, the 1968 season in Detroit seemed to fit so well into the flow of the documentary.  A city in Detroit that was ravaged by race riots with a team that lived, breathed and tasted the experience, but also drank the cup of victory.  That story is as much about the city of Detroit as it is baseball.  It is etched in the city's history and it is unreasonable not to tell such a story in the context of the decade. I wonder what went into why it was not told or how it ended up on the cutting room floor?  Was this at the request of Curt Flood, who was featured in this decade's segment?  It was Flood's stumble and defensive miscue in center field that handed Detroit a game seven and series victory.  In general, I found the lack of midwestern baseball stories to be as aggravating as baseball coverage is in general from the national media.  The St. Louis Cardinals are the only midwest representative in this segment.  Regretfully, this is the case with the one documentarian who can get a grant package big enough to produce such a large series on national public television.  Where is the public service?Secondly, the tone of the film is terrible.  It's rather depressing to watch.  It relies too heavily on a few commentators and subjects.  Those historians who talk about their experience with events as fans are dispassionate about the game.  The film should have found fans instead of historians.  Since it clearly was not concerned with any sort of comprehensive history, but instead storytelling, go to the people who can tell stories best.  Those would be baseball fans, not historians.  Trust me, the history of the game is easily told without historians speaking to their personal connection and childhood experiences.The film could have been a great deal of fun to watch, even without being comprehensive.  I would love to have seen some of the passion and excitement of the New York Mets fans in 1969, even though the Mets received too much attention at that point of the eighth segment.Overall, the set is not fun to watch.  I've been a passionate baseball fan since as early as I can remember but ""Baseball"" by Ken Burns is not something that I am attracted to, but rather felt the need to endure to be able to claim I hadn't missed it.

So it was perfect that my husband ponied up to buy me the DVDs of Ken Burns' *Baseball.*Ken Burns' groundbreaking documentary style is well-known and well-suited to the subject of baseball. He must have spent countless hours sifting through the sport's vast history and lore to come up with a thread that holds the story together through an entire 150-year history. I do agree that there is an East Coast focus, but the East Coast is where baseball was born, grew up, and came of age. I also think the racial angle is overplayed, but this is PBS, so you wouldn't expect them to be subtle about that. Fun things for everybody are trying to identify the actors that voice the characters, and hearing commentators from all walks of life tell what the game means to them.So, unlike, say, Pat Burrell, the *Baseball* DVD set is well worth the money and will continue to bring enjoyment for years to come. I know that I will be watching it every late-winter as part of my pre-pre-season warmup till the discs fall apart.

The narration, interviews, music, video images and editing all are very well done in terms of being a polished product.

Bob Costas: &quot;The thing you have to remember, and this seems so obvious, is that baseball is a beautiful thing...&quot;  Uh, excuse me Bob, but spitting tobacco juice and scratching your crotch every 15 seconds don't seem to rise to the level of beauty.Robert Creamer: &quot;The thing about baseball is the best game that's ever been invented.&quot;  Been to a game lately, Rob?  It's 3 1/2 hours of batters stepping out of the box to adjust their jock straps, pitching coaches coming to the mound to discuss the evening's dinner plans, fat relievers walking in from the bullpen at a tortoise pace.Instead of giving us an objective account of baseball history, Burns portrays ballplayers in general as exploited chattel.  He overdoes the &quot;tragedy&quot; of the negro leagues.

37380,A16QODENBJVUI1,0780630459,Robert Moore,"[11, 13]","This exceptional series from documentarian extraordinaire Ken Burns is a baseball lover's delight.  For a huge number of Americans, the game of baseball holds a special place in our hearts that cannot be effaced by other interests or supplanted by another sport.  It embraces a host of paradoxes and yet seems pure and primal and simple in a way that other team sports do not.  It has emerged as the thinking-person's sport, with a wealth of literary works-whether fictional, historical, analytical, or statistical-that dwarves the literary products of all other sports combined (only boxing can even remotely make the same kinds of literary claims).  Yet, it is almost impossible to express all the reasons for the appeal that baseball holds for its fans.  Usually a case has to be made obliquely, by teasing out the maze of puzzles at its heart-e.g., it is the only major sport where you score without the ball or the only sport where the ball begins in the hands of the defense-and for those impatient to dismiss the sport as boring it is not an easy case to make.  But for the nonfan, this superb series can at least provide some hints for why some of us love it so much.  For the fan, it is heaven.Burns's and his crew follow the history of baseball from its earliest days all the way down to the present (or at least circa 1990, the series debuting in 1994).  Some of the most fascinating parts of the series consists in the remarkable photographs and footage shown in the first two or three episodes.  I had never previously seen Ty Cobb in action, or any footage at all of Christy Mathewson, and while I had read about Walter Johnson's sidearm, almost underhanded, throwing motion, what that precisely looked like, I had no idea.  Now I do.  The series provides a host of revelations about idols from the past.  Some of the footage is unbelievable, such as a clip featuring Babe Ruth where he actually shuffles up to the front of the batter's box to get a better angle on a pitched ball before slugging it.  I didn't think that such a thing was possible (though a friend of mine has informed me that Ted Williams on at least one occasion did the same thing to attack an Eephus pitch, towering curve that arrives with a massive arch and minimal velocity), but constant replays on the DVD confirmed it.  On nearly every major figure in the history of baseball there is either remarkable footage or spectacular photographs.  And the ballparks!  I now have a better idea of what Forbes Field and the Polo Grounds looked like than I ever did before.The series also excels at covering some of the more important aspects of the history of baseball.  For instance, the shameful treatment of African Americans, banning them from baseball, despite the fact that many black players were among the best players of their age, or even of all time.  Burns's covers the careers of such great black players as Rube Foster, Satchell Paige, Josh Gibson, and Cool Papa Bell, all of which is brought even more vividly to life through numerous interviews with Buck O'Neill.  The Jackie Robinson story is given especial and proper focus, and actually begins early in the series by covering carefully the early career of the great Branch Rickey.Most of the great moments in the history of baseball are covered, such as Ruth's supposed called shot, Bill Mazerowski's World Series ending homerun, a severely hung over Grover Cleveland Alexander's groggily walking out to the mound to pitch an inning in the World Series the day after he celebrated his victory in the previous game, Bobby Thompson's home run heard around the world, Hank Aaron's 715th homerun, Willie Mays's spectacular catch of Vic Wertz's drive to deep center field, and Brooks Robinson's almost surreal throw from the 3rd base coaches box to snag a runner at first.  Not all of the great plays are included.  As a Cub fan, I was disappointed to see one of the most famous home runs in baseball history, Gabby Hartnett's ""Homer in the Gloamin'"" omitted, and I am utterly perplexed as to why the Cubs' famous collapse in 1969 received no mention.  Any Cub fan is aware that that season virtually defines the post-1945 Cubs, and ignoring it also meant ignoring Billy Williams and Ron Santo.  These omissions do point out the only serious fault I find in the series:  the extreme New York-Boston bias of the series.  One can come away from it with the impression that virtually nothing of importance to baseball took place outside of those two northeastern cities.  Granted, there have been times when the game did seem to exist primarily there, such as the 1950s, but baseball has definitely been played elsewhere as well.The guest commentators are, for the most part, eloquent and articulate.  No one individual stands out in the way that Shelby Foote did in Burns's THE CIVIL WAR, not even Foote, who makes some a couple of appearances, but as a group they are either quite entertaining or insightful.  My one regret is that more of the game's great players did not participate.  In many instances this isn't a surprise.  Joe DiMaggio, one of the more unpleasant personalities in the history of baseball despite the love the public lavished on him, certainly would not have been interested.  Sandy Koufax would have been great, but his desire to stay out of the limelight probably precluded his involvement.  Ted Williams, Mickey Mantle, Bob Feller, and a few others appeared, but they are far surpassed by the great players who did not appear.  This I very much regret.I hope that this remarkable series might someday be brought out in a new DVD edition.  We expect far more in the way of extras today than when this first appeared as a DVD set, and one can imagine that there is a large body of material eligible for inclusion.  One can access ""Baseball Cards,"" for instance, of the key players, but these could have been so much more interesting, including stills and even film footage.  Even as it is, however, this series will be essential viewing for any person who cares at all for the American pastime.  For those who don't love the game, it can serve as a great introduction to understanding those of us who do.",5,Irresistible for any baseball fan,1092182400,"08 11, 2004",2004,6170,"['exceptional',

I just enjoyed this so much...learning about the origins of the game, the negro leagues and the struggles that they went through and all of the colorful and tremendously talented players and managers that have made baseball what it is and such a pleasure to behold...I felt however that too much time was devoted to covering Jackie Robinson...by the end I just felt like it was never going to end.  By contrast Willie Mays was not covered much at all and neither was Duke Snyder...and Mickey ...whose coverage lasted maybe 15 minutes total...with the sad, &#34;drunken&#34; music playing in the background ending with the supposed quote &#34;My father died young, I'm not going to be cheated...&#34; did not do justice to Mickey at all.  Mickey was such an incredible ball player.  To me it simply wasn't necessary to end the segment in that way. (let's not forget that alcoholism is an illness).  Mickey's amazing catch that saved Don Larson's perfect game was completely ignored...really.  That being said, everybody has their favorite baseball player...so any amount of coverage won't be enough...but the overwhelming focus on Jackie was just over the top.  Don't get me wrong, Jackie was amazing and he was a good man by all accounts...but I feel that it should have been more balanced coverage with other baseball greats. I loved hearing about Satchel Paige too...there should have been more there also and I felt that Ted Williams was overemphasized.  Like all Ken Burns' works, this is amazing and it's something I will watch over and over again...but probably fast forwarding through certain parts.

Ken Burns covers the orgins of baseball from its beginings in the 1800s to the present (1992). He uses both interviews and pictures. Each part covers a decade of baseball (except the first and the last). The first covers the origins up to 1900 and the final part covers from 1970 to the present.One part that sticks out for me is Jackie Robinsion's breaking the color barrier and the racism he had to face. Jackie Robinson's entry into the big leagues lead to more  African Americans enreing the majors and the eventual decline of the Negro Leagues. This racism prevented great players such as Sachel Paige from realizing their full potential.Another part that sticked out was the ""Blacksox"" scandal when 8 Chicago Whitesox were acused of throwing the 1919 world series to gamblers. This almost led to the destruction of baseball. Baseball was eventually saved by the legendary Babe Ruth. There is talk of reinstating Pete Rose. Personally I feel Joe Jackson and the other seven WHitesox players should be reinstated before Pete Rose. Pete Rose knew full well what he was doing. The Chicago Whitesox players were nieve and did not have a full understanding of what they were getting into. I am not condoning their actions but, if Pete Rose is reinstated then they should be reinstated.Babe Ruth was the center of the most heated rivalries in baseball. The then owner of the Boston Redsox, Harry Frazee, traded Babe Ruth to the Yankees. He was a theatrical producer and loved the theatre more than his own team. He wanted to finance a play so he traded Babe Ruth to the Yankees. According to the video when ever Frazee wanted to finance a play he would trade one of his top players. Most of those players whent to the Yankees. This led to bad feelings between the two clubs that still exists today. The trade turned the Yankees around and was the begining of their dynasty. Up to this point it was the Giants, not the Yankees, who were the major baseball team in New York.The history of baseball is always being written. The series ended in1992. It did not include the strike in 1994 and the cancelation of the world series. The documentary did not include Sammy Sosa and Mark Mcguwire going for Roger Maris' single season home run record and Barry Bonds breaking Mcgwire's record a few years later.Ken Burms vividly captured the the culture of each time period.

Nowhere is this feeling more prevalent than in this marvelous Baseball collection. Here, the history of the grand old game is brilliantly portrayed juxtaposed with sublime commentary...the result being an amazing perspective on the game and a testament to American culture.Organized into nine ""innings"", we're taken on a journey from the acknowledged beginning of the game on the New Jersey Elysian Fields in the mid 1800's (although the true beginning of the American game is a little more complex) to the early 1990's. Seperated into approximate decades per episode, the game's evolution and history is masterfully covered with expository narration from historian David McCullough along with expert commentary from Dan Okrent, Buck O'Neal, Roger Angell and Bob Costas among many others.A major foundation of this film is the history of the black movement in baseball and a marvelous recounting of the Negro Leagues. Jackie Robinson's integration story is revealed more from the personal anguish that he suffered than his performance on the field...his wife is interviewed and adds significant depth to this story and becomes a certain highlight of the movie.Another highlight is the 8th ""inning"" coverage of possibly my favorite player, Sandy Koufax. Dan Okrent's commentary on Koufax's 1961 to 1966 performance as being possibly the greatest by any pitcher in history touches a personal accord in me that really is the essence of this film...every viewer surely has a ""favorite"" moment in baseball history and to see it personified in this film makes it that much more enjoyable.Certainly baseball fans will love it and I'd recommend that all who have an interest in American history or culture watch this...you will not be disappointed.",5,Truly the national pastime...,1263513600,"01 15, 2010",2010,1848,"['Ken', 'Burns', 'film', 'appeal', 'always', 'centered', 'atmosphere', 'quiet', 'leisure', 'introspective', 'thought', 'feeling', 'more', 'prevalent', 'marvelous', 'collection', 'Here', 'history', 'grand', 'old', 'game', 'brilliantly', 'portrayed', 'juxtaposed', 'sublime', 'commentary', 'result', 'being', 'amazing', 'perspective', 'game', 'testament', 'American', 'culture.Organized', 'nine', 'innings', ""'re"", 'taken', 'journey', 'acknowledged', 'beginning', 'game', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Elysian', 'Fields', 'mid', '1800', 'true', 'beginning', 'American', 'game', 'little', 'more', 'complex', 'early', '1990', 'Seperated', 'approximate', 'decades', 'episode', 'game', 'evolution', 'history', 'masterfully', 'covered', 'expository', 'narration', 'historian', 'David', 'McCullough', 'expert', 'commentary', 'Dan', 'Okrent', 'Buck', ""O'Neal"", 'Roger', 'Angell', 'Bob', 'Costas', 'many', 'others.A', 'major', 'foundation', 'film', 'history', 'black', 'movement', 'baseball', 'marvelous', 'recounting', 'Negro', 'Leagues', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'integration', 'story', 'revealed', 'more', 'personal', 'anguish', 'suffered', 'performance', 'field', 'wife', 'interviewed', 'significant', 'depth', 'story', 'certain', 'highlight', 'movie.Another', 'highlight', '8th', 'inning', 'coverage', 'possibly', 'favorite', 'player', 'Sandy', 'Koufax', 'Dan', 'Okrent', 'commentary', 'Koufax', '1961', '1966', 'performance', 'being', 'possibly', 'greatest', 'pitcher', 'history', 'touches', 'personal', 'accord', 'really', 'essence', 'film', 'viewer', 'surely', 'favorite', 'moment', 'baseball', 'history', 'see', 'personified', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable.Certainly', 'baseball', 'fans', 'will', 'love', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'who', 'have', 'interest', 'American', 'history', 'culture', 'watch', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

37408,AAD2DYRK43BYF,0780630459,Weston J. Kathman,"[16, 17]","Few filmmakers are better than Ken Burns when it comes to shooting documentaries.  Burns' Baseball series is further proof that he is one of the best documentary filmmakers around today, although Baseball pales in  comparison to Burns' Civil War series.  This anthology has some great  things going for it; for instance, it's for the most part very well written  and is accompanied by great photos.  The music is also quite good.  Many of  the people who were interviewed for these films offer superb commentary,  especially the former Negro Leaguer Buck O'Neil, one of the most delightful  personalities the game has ever produced.  Most of baseball's best moments  are highlighted with proper detail.  Unlike most baseball histories (books  or films), Burns' documentary gives extensive coverage of the Negro  Leagues, which only makes the series better.  For the most part, this is a  very strong, very well-done series.  Unfortunately, it does suffer from a  few shortcomings.  Many people have complained that Burns chose to focus  too much on certain teams, like the New York Yankees, Brooklyn Dodgers, and  Boston Red Sox.  These critics may have a legitimate complaint, but they  have to realize that those three teams are steeped in baseball history and  do deserve a lot of coverage, although probably not as much as they  received.  Because those three clubs were focused on so heavily, many teams  and players were given the shaft.  Stan Musial doesn't even get mentioned  in the video that focuses on the 1940s, a decade in which he became one of  the five or ten best ballplayers of all time.  But at least he gets  mentioned (on some of the other videos).  Mike Schmidt, generally  considered the greatest third basemen who ever lived, isn't mentioned even  once during the entire 20-hour series.  This type of oversight is  tremendous and cannot be ignored.  The fact of the matter is that Schmidt  played in the 70s and 80s, two decades (along with almost half of the 90s)  that were crammed into the same video.  As a result, much of modern  baseball history is neglected.  Where is the famous George Brett Pine Tar  Incident?  What about all the player strikes, especially the one in 1981  that split the season in half?  Why isn't the amazing 1991 World Series  covered in greater detail?  The answer is that Burns tried to cover too  much time in the last video.  The 70s was certainly a good enough baseball  decade to warrant an entire video, and Burns could have covered the 80s up  to the present with another video.  But that would have meant having ten  videos instead of nine, thus eliminating the opportunity to call each  series installment an inning (oh boy, that would've ruined it).  Another  problem is that some of the people who are interviewed are way too  sentimental.  John Thorn, for instance, goes completely off the deep end  with his comments several times, especially when he compares baseball to  &quot;the promise of eternal life.&quot;  One can do justice to baseball  without resorting to careless sap.  Unfortunately, this series gets sappy  more often than it should.  Yes, baseball is a great game, but it is not  the meaning of life.  Despite all of these problems, the series is  extremely informative and very entertaining.  Worth buying if you love the  game.",4,Very Good But Not Excellent,964483200,"07 25, 2000",2000,3314,"['Few', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'better', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'when', 'shooting', 'documentaries', 'Burns', 'Baseball', 'series', 'further', 'proof', 'one', 'best', 'documentary', 'filmmakers', 'today', 'Baseball', 'pales', 'comparison', 'Burns', 'Civil', 'War', 'series', 'anthology', 'great', 'things', 'going', 'instance', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'accompanied', 'great', 'photos', 'music', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'Many', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'interviewed', 'films', 'offer', 'superb', 'commentary', 'especially', 'former', 'Negro', 'Leaguer', 'Buck', ""O'Neil"", 'one', 'most', 'delightful', 'personalities', 'game', 'ever', 'produced', 'Most', 'baseball', 'best', 'moments', 'are', 'highlighted', 'proper', 'detail', 'most', 'baseball', 'histories', 'books', 'films', 'Burns', 'documentary', 'extensive', 'coverage', 'Negro', 'Leagues', 'only', 'series', 'better', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'strong', 'very', 'well-done', 'series', 'Unfortunately', 'suffer', 'few', 'shortcomings', 'Many', 'people', 'have', 'complained', 'Burns', 'chose', 'focus', 'too', 'much', 'certain', 'teams', 'New', 'York', 'Yankees', 'Brooklyn', 'Dodgers', 'Boston', 'Red', 'Sox', 'critics', 'may', 'have', 'legitimate', 'complaint', 'have', 'realize', 'three', 'teams', 'are', 'steeped', 'baseball', 'history', 'do', 'deserve', 'lot', 'coverage', 'probably', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'received', 'three', 'clubs', 'were', 'focused', 'heavily', 'many', 'teams', 'players', 'were', 'given', 'shaft', 'Stan', 'Musial', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'mentioned', 'video', '1940s', 'decade', 'became', 'one', 'five', 'ten', 'best', 'ballplayers', 'time', 'least', 'mentioned', 'other', 'videos', 'Mike', 'Schmidt', 'generally', 'considered', 'greatest', 'third', 'basemen', 'who', 'ever', 'lived', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'even', 'once', 'entire', '20-hour', 'series', 'type', 'oversight', 'tremendous', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'ignored', 'fact', 'matter', 'Schmidt', 'played', '70s', '80s', 'two', 'decades', 'almost', 'half', '90s', 'were', 'crammed', 'same', 'video', 'result', 'much', 'modern', 'baseball', 'history', 'neglected', 'Where', 'famous', 'George', 'Brett', 'Pine', 'Tar', 'Incident', 'What', 'player', 'strikes', 'especially', 'one', '1981', 'split', 'season', 'half', 'Why', ""n't"", 'amazing', '1991', 'World', 'Series', 'covered', 'greater', 'detail', 'answer', 'Burns', 'tried', 'cover', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'last', 'video', '70s', 'was', 'certainly', 'good', 'enough', 'baseball', 'decade', 'warrant', 'entire', 'video', 'Burns', 'could', 'have', 'covered', '80s', 'up', 'present', 'video', 'would', 'have', 'meant', 'having', 'ten', 'videos', 'instead', 'nine', 'thus', 'eliminating', 'opportunity', 'call', 'series', 'installment', 'inning', 'oh', 'boy', 'would', ""'ve"", 'ruined', 'problem', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'interviewed', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'sentimental', 'John', 'Thorn', 'instance', 'completely', 'deep', 'end', 'comments', 'several', 'times', 'especially', 'when', 'baseball', 'quot', 'promise', 'eternal', 'life.', 'quot', 'One', 'can', 'do', 'justice', 'baseball', 'resorting', 'careless', 'sap', 'Unfortunately', 'series', 'sappy', 'more', 'often', 'should', 'Yes', 'baseball', 'great', 'game', 'not', 'meaning', 'life', 'problems', 'series', 'extremely', 'informative', 'very', 'entertaining', 'Worth', 'buying', 'love', 'game']",N/A

He accepted the job as commissioner of baseball because it paid more than being a U.S. Senator.  Enjoy the stories about Satchel Paige, et al.You will love it.

37410,A38QEATH3NODFM,0780630459,Wiseguy 945,"[1, 2]","After his sucess with ""the Civil War"", Ken burns sought to make another masterpiece, another epic series, which was captured here in the film Baseball.  This was a very long series, 18 hours total.  What can I say, it doen't miss much. Starting at the beginning until 1992, just prior to the player's strike of 1994.  An awesome look at old player, ballparks, and the development of the League in general.  It was long to watch, and I know the Segregation issue was tough in baseball, but dang they spent a long time driving that point home stretching it over about 3 tapes. I wish one episode would have concentrated on it more, history, timeline,players and teams, but I guess that's difficult with the series being set up by decades.  I would like to have seen it not skip over 1970-1993, it skipped over many of the scandals (pittsburg pirates 80's drug scandal, Pete rose was a blurp,) and unfortunately the series was before the whole strike fiasco and now some good years since.  One big complaint, why is Shelby Foote in this series at all....he's the civil war buff that annoyed me the first time round.

Why would he do that, and (worse), why would Burns film him that way?

37412,A1P6NRWDD1NT4B,0780630459,"Yendor ""sknayfan""","[5, 8]","Not much to add to the other reviews, but this is a mere perfect film documentary by Ken Burns.  The documentary takes on a life of its own by becoming a loving tribute to Jackie Robinson, Black Baseball and an act of asking forgiveness for baseball's segregation. It is ironic that when the documentary was released in the fall of 1994, Baseball had just went into a major strike and there was no Baseball World Series that year. A minor footnote is that the New York Yankees were on the verge of a major image overhaul in the wake of Steinbrenner's second suspension and were to become contenders again when he was reinstated. Ken Burns should revisit the documentary with a follow-up film to cover the Yankees return to dynastic prominence in the mid to late 90's, the eventual end of the Red Sox so-called 'Curse' in the new millenium along with the loss of Joe Dimaggio, Ted Williams and Mickey Mantle. The documentary focuses in on the Baseball's rich history that is emphasized by the statistics of individuals that are used as a yardstick to measure the performances of upcoming and future players. Lastly, KEN BURNS' BASEBALL is a detailed fountain of information, history, and entertainment from the obscure to the obvious that demands repeat viewings showing why baseball is the 'National Pastime'. Note: Great quote from columnist and television personality George Will on the comparisons of Baseball to Football. George Will states, ""Football combines the two worst features of modern American life.  It is violence punctuated by committee meetings. In addition, Football demonstrates the manic division of labor that makes life confusing and (I should think)...unsatisfying...""",5,The American Pastime,1115856000,"05 12, 2005",2005,1691,"['Not', 'much', 'add', 'other', 'reviews', 'mere', 'perfect', 'film', 'documentary', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'documentary', 'life', 'own', 'becoming', 'loving', 'tribute', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'Black', 'Baseball', 'act', 'asking', 'forgiveness', 'baseball', 'segregation', 'ironic', 'when', 'documentary', 'was', 'released', 'fall', '1994', 'Baseball', 'had', 'just', 'went', 'major', 'strike', 'was', 'Baseball', 'World', 'Series', 'year', 'minor', 'footnote', 'New', 'York', 'Yankees', 'were', 'verge', 'major', 'image', 'overhaul', 'wake', 'Steinbrenner', 'second', 'suspension', 'were', 'become', 'contenders', 'again', 'when', 'was', 'reinstated', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'should', 'revisit', 'documentary', 'follow-up', 'film', 'cover', 'Yankees', 'return', 'dynastic', 'prominence', 'mid', 'late', '90', 'eventual', 'end', 'Red', 'Sox', 'so-called', ""'Curse"", 'new', 'millenium', 'loss', 'Joe', 'Dimaggio', 'Ted', 'Williams', 'Mickey', 'Mantle', 'documentary', 'focuses', 'Baseball', 'rich', 'history', 'emphasized', 'statistics', 'individuals', 'are', 'used', 'yardstick', 'measure', 'performances', 'upcoming', 'future', 'players', 'Lastly', 'KEN', 'BURNS', 'BASEBALL', 'detailed', 'fountain', 'information', 'history', 'entertainment', 'obscure', 'obvious', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'showing', 'why', 'baseball', ""'National"", 'Pastime', 'Note', 'Great', 'quote', 'columnist', 'television', 'personality', 'George', 'Will', 'comparisons', 'Baseball', 'Football', 'George', 'Will', 'Football', 'two', 'worst', 'features', 'modern', 'American', 'life', 'violence', 'punctuated', 'committee', 'meetings', 'addition', 'Football', 'manic', 'division', 'labor', 'life', 'confusing', 'should', 'think', 'unsatisfying']",N/A
37413,AP3B615GM191G,0780630459,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 1]","Only the sport of baseball could lend itself (via its long, rich heritage) to a Ken Burns-style documentary.  Of course, Burns nails it once again.Though not as emotionally touching as his Civil War or World War II documentaries, Baseball captures the essence of America's pastime.  From Walter Johnson, Babe Ruth, and Ty Cobb to Willie, Mickey, and the Duke, to Yaz, Pete Rose, Mick Schmidt, and everyone in between, Burns recounts all the rousing stories that old fans will recite from memory and younger fans will be fascinated by.  Guest commentators wax poetically about the game, old veterans tell their stories, and Burn's traditional mix of period music, solo piano, and aching violin provide an emotional punch, whether positive or negative.However, what really sets this film apart from others is Burn's willingness to ""pull no punches"" in terms of describing the often-flawed sport of baseball.  Whether it be the rowdyism that plagued the game in its early existence, the ""Black Sox"" scandal of 1919, or baseball's outright racism until the late 1940s, Burns explains those issues without letting too much personal bias creep in.Overall, this is a wonderful documentary for baseball fans who truly value the rich history of the sport.  When watching, you will fell as if you actually exist in whatever decade Burns happens to be describing.

Like most Ken Burns documentaries, we see old photos accompanied by ancient fiddle and piano music. Disc 2 (1900-1910) highlights the founding of the American League by Ban Johnson, with more grainy photos and fiddles (just what we were hoping for).Disc 3 (1910-1920)introduces immigrants coming to America who discover baseball. Disk 4 introduces Babe Ruth with jazz music in the background. Disk 5 (1930-1940) brings the Negro Leagues and the Great Depression. Satchel Paige, a star player in the Negro Leagues, makes an appearance accompanied by more jazz. Disc 6 (1940-1950) highlights Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams and Jackie Robinson's debut in the big leagues.In the middle sections the Star Spangled Banner is ubiquitous, played in various renditions (don't forget to take off your hat). The most dramatic version is the national anthem played at full volume followed by a great version of George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, also at full volume.Disk 7 (1950-1960) features the World Series between the As and Dodgers. Disk 8 (1960-1970) features the Giants and Dodgers before they move to California and Roger Maris' 61 home runs. Disk 9 (1970-1992) covers a gambling scandal and a new home run record. The final set has 2 disks which cover 1992-2009 and features Latin players.Finally, the commentary by many observers of the game is excellent.
