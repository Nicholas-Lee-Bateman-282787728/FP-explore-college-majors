678771,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B00005RDAO,Alistair McHarg,"[2, 2]","What's odd about Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned is that its only flaws are attributable to the screenplay, which was written by Walter Mosley, who also wrote the book it's based on.  The film feels like a succession of vignettes loosely strung together, unified by a central character.  Fortunately that central character, Socrates Fortlow, is played by Laurence Fishburne, who is easily strong enough to carry the film on his shoulders.  (Trivia buffs may be interested to learn that Fishburne's first role was in Apocalypse Now.)The picture is rich with talent.  In addition to Fishburne, (unforgettable in What's Love Got To With It?), there's Cicely Tyson, Natalie Cole, Laurie Metcalf, and a really nice performance from Bill Cobbs.  Director Michael Apted is no slouch either, having given us Gorillas In The Mist and Nell, among others.  High points to HBO - again - for setting the quality standard.  Despite an (almost) all black cast, and a ghetto setting, (not to mention an ex-con protagonist), this is not the typical gangsta dreck we've come to expect from Hollywood.  (Call me the next time Hollywood makes a feature film about a black CPA, heart surgeon, or symphony conductor.)What we have instead is a thoroughly gripping story of a solitary man emerging from prison after 18 years, a convicted rapist and murderer, trying to find a place for himself in society.  He has clearly had plenty of time to come to terms with his crimes, and the significance of using violence to solve problems.  He has also developed a kind of stoicism.  Where prison is hideously corrupting for many, for Socrates it has been a place to learn self-respect, responsibility, and independence.  He has few social interactions, but to each one he brings tremendous personal power, a sense of justice, and a willingness to extend himself for the benefit of others.Despite his nobility, there is still a tremendous rage burning in Socrates.  We see it in its most raw form when he encounters the workaday world he is trying to re-enter.  He is willing to play by the rules, and he carries himself with manners that are almost courtly, but despite his best efforts even getting a job at a supermarket is virtually impossible.  It sounds improbable, but by the time this movie is over we feel nothing but sympathy for Socrates and believe, as his friend does, that he is a ""hero.""  Not a hero from the comic books, and not an anti-hero either.  Just an everyday hero who has managed to pull himself out of the muck, regain dignity despite what he's done, and touch a handful of lives in a way that is so uniquely positive, only he could have done it.  Uplifting, and highly recommended.",5,The Power Of One,1176508800,"04 14, 2007",2007,2682,"['What', 'odd', 'Always', 'Outnumbered', 'Always', 'Outgunned', 'only', 'flaws', 'are', 'attributable', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Walter', 'Mosley', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'book', 'based', 'film', 'feels', 'succession', 'vignettes', 'loosely', 'strung', 'together', 'unified', 'central', 'character', 'Fortunately', 'central', 'character', 'Socrates', 'Fortlow', 'played', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'who', 'easily', 'strong', 'enough', 'carry', 'film', 'shoulders', 'Trivia', 'buffs', 'may', 'be', 'interested', 'learn', 'Fishburne', 'first', 'role', 'was', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'picture', 'rich', 'talent', 'addition', 'Fishburne', 'unforgettable', 'What', 'Love', 'Got', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'Natalie', 'Cole', 'Laurie', 'Metcalf', 'really', 'nice', 'performance', 'Bill', 'Cobbs', 'Director', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'slouch', 'either', 'having', 'given', 'Gorillas', 'Mist', 'Nell', 'others', 'High', 'points', 'HBO', 'again', 'setting', 'quality', 'standard', 'almost', 'black', 'cast', 'ghetto', 'setting', 'not', 'mention', 'ex-con', 'protagonist', 'not', 'typical', 'gangsta', 'dreck', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'Hollywood', 'Call', 'next', 'time', 'Hollywood', 'feature', 'film', 'black', 'CPA', 'heart', 'surgeon', 'symphony', 'conductor', 'What', 'have', 'instead', 'thoroughly', 'gripping', 'story', 'solitary', 'man', 'emerging', 'prison', '18', 'years', 'convicted', 'rapist', 'murderer', 'trying', 'find', 'place', 'society', 'clearly', 'had', 'plenty', 'time', 'come', 'terms', 'crimes', 'significance', 'using', 'violence', 'solve', 'problems', 'also', 'developed', 'kind', 'stoicism', 'Where', 'prison', 'hideously', 'corrupting', 'many', 'Socrates', 'been', 'place', 'learn', 'self-respect', 'responsibility', 'independence', 'few', 'social', 'interactions', 'one', 'tremendous', 'personal', 'power', 'sense', 'justice', 'willingness', 'extend', 'benefit', 'others.Despite', 'nobility', 'still', 'tremendous', 'rage', 'burning', 'Socrates', 'see', 'most', 'raw', 'form', 'when', 'workaday', 'world', 'trying', 're-enter', 'willing', 'play', 'rules', 'manners', 'are', 'almost', 'courtly', 'best', 'efforts', 'even', 'getting', 'job', 'supermarket', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'improbable', 'time', 'movie', 'feel', 'nothing', 'sympathy', 'Socrates', 'believe', 'friend', 'hero', 'Not', 'hero', 'comic', 'books', 'not', 'anti-hero', 'Just', 'everyday', 'hero', 'who', 'managed', 'pull', 'muck', 'regain', 'dignity', 'what', 'done', 'touch', 'handful', 'lives', 'way', 'so', 'uniquely', 'positive', 'only', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Uplifting', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

He struggles to help, by using his destructive abilities to improve the lives of those around him. As much as you want to condemn him for his past, you also hope he'll succeed. You almost want to forgive him, even though he'll never, ever forgive himself.If you are a fan of Laurence Fishburne you will find this film especially satisfying.

I ran across it on a cable station, saw parts of it and got a copy so I could watch it in full.

Although we saw flashbacks of him waking up with nightmares, I wasn't quite sure whether he really did it or was set up because of it. (I'll read the book to find out.) Laurence Fishburne did an excellent job in this movie, and so did the rest of the outstanding cast of heavy hitters like Cicely Tyson, Bill Cobbs, Laurie Metcalf, Isaiah Washington and more. The young boy who played the one caught up between getting bullied into a gang and suffering from the memories of a boy being killed in front of him was so great to watch.
