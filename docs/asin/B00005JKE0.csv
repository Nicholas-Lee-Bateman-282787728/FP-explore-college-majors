Porthos was a rare find in this film, he had most of the best lines.D'Artangan is too American to really work, he was a CK model after all.The action scenes were poorly done, the fencing bad and the wirework way too obvious.

Sadly, most better them are better than this one.But there are two saving graces for this movie. First is Justin Chambers, who stars as D'Artagnan. There is a freshness that Mr. Chambers brings to the movie, which is more obvious when compared to the staleness that is the rest of the movie. The second saving grace is the choreography of the fight scenes. Fight choreographer Xiong Xin Xin, of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" fame, brings a fluidic movement to D'Artagnan's fight scenes.Feel free to rent this movie once.

586042,A1NSMQIF1C2VCE,B00005JKE0,Beau Yarbrough,"[1, 3]","On the surface, ""The Musketeer"" has a good central idea: Take Dumas' classic swashbuckling tale and add a touch of modern Hong Kong wire work to the action. Described like that, it's easy to see what was intended: Soaring, even transcendant action, battles that are as much dance as they are combat, and a shot in the arm to a nearly dead genre.It didn't quite turn out that way.It has been said that too many cooks can spoil the soup, and here, we see too many ideas doing the same. ""The Musketeer"" rolls together too-little wire work, a grubbily accurate recreation of the period (which means the film is so dark that you miss much of the action), a special focus on D'Artagnan over the rest of the Musketeers, a stellar cast (Tim Roth as Fabre is better than the rest of the film combined) and a script that was clearly intended to ignore almost all of the above assets, putting the focus on the poorly lit and poorly shot action. (Seriously, did anyone immediately understand what happened to Fabre at the end?) Toss in a lead played by an underwear model who can't pronounce his character's name, and you've got big trouble right here in Paris city.Done well, audiences can forgive much of the silliness of swashbuckling films (they did so as recently as the Antonio Bandaras ""Mask of Zorro""), but in a film like ""The Musketeer"" scenes of soldiers repelling down a tower to get at D'Artagnan instead of, I don't know, just CUTTING THE ROPES become maddening instead.A film that desperately wants to be ""The Matrix"" instead comes off as yet another tired film attempting to cash in on the craze for Hong Kong-style action it helped create.Not recommended for fans of the original work or Hong Kong-style action.

It's not intended to conform to the original story of the musketeers.  Instead, it's a movie that brings the western idea of chivalry and swordplay and fuses it with the eastern style of martial arts fighting.  It's like Jackie Chan meets D'Artagnan, only Jackie's not here.Still, the bad reviews are right about one thing--the story is not very interesting, and it's nothing you haven't seen before.  What remains, then, are the fight scenes, which are brilliantly choreographed and very well-filmed.

586044,A2HP9COIPKXQ1I,B00005JKE0,"B-MAN ""B""","[5, 6]","Well most of the Musketeers in this film did anyway, except for the leading male hero of the film, D'Artagnan!  I had no idea this film would be so dull considering that Peter Hyams (2010, Outland) directed it and Tim Roth (Rob Roy, Reservoir Dogs), who is totally wasted here, starring as the bad guy, Febre.  The film is just not exciting and I found myself not really caring about the hero's revenge or much of anything else after a certain point.  First of all, I have no idea who Justin Chambers (leading man/hero, D'Artagnan) is but I do know he turns out a dull and uninteresting performance in this film.  It doesent help that he resembles Chris O' Donnell who played the same character in ""The Three Musketeers"" with Charlie Sheen and Keifer Sutherland.  That movie may have been silly but at least it was entertaining.  I would like to see the DVD feature of ""Casting Justin Chambers"" to find out what they were thinking.  Even the one thing that I thought would save ""The Musketeer"", the fight sequences, were not as exciting as I thought they would be, but they did keep me awake.  I had heard the fight choreography compared to ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" somewhere - my answer to that is: go rent ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".  The finale sword fight on ladders between Roth and Chambers (their stunt doubles) is of course the highlight of the film but it's over before you know it and I'm still not quite sure how the bad guy died, I'm assuming by sword.  I expected Roth to carry the film but that was asking too much.  He is still the most exciting character in the film but that isnt saying much, considering the competition.  Actually, I was thinking he might use one of those ladders in the final fight to climb out of the movie!  Mena Suvari (American Beauty) plays the love interest for Chambers. There is no reason why they should be together except he's the best looking guy around and she's the only girl in town and they dont waste anytime putting her in a bath tub again either.  My favorite part is when she is shot in the chest almost point blank range when ""taking one"" for the Queen and in the next scene, she's fine.  The weird part is I didn't feel much sympathy for her when she was shot.  Actually, I felt more sympathy for D'Artagnan's horse when it fell over from exhaustion.  It doesent help that the whole 3 Musketeer ""All for one..."" thing is done in a tired predictable fashion in movies.  Its definitely getting old seeing  french Musketeers with american accents!

586050,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B00005JKE0,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[1, 2]","Upon hearing that yet another version of Alexander Dumas' classic tale ""The Three Musketeers"" would be making its way onto the big screen, my friend was just a bit skeptical.""They're making another one?"" he said in a less than an enthusiastic tone. ""How many times can they remake it?""Fearing that my friends response may be duplicated by more than a few moviegoers, Universal Pictures made sure that their Musketeer film, ""The Musketeer,"" would be unlike any rendition of Dumas' tale you've ever seen before.Unfortunately, a little more similarity to other Musketeer movies probably would have propelled ""The Musketeer"" from average movie fare to cinematic classic.Lest you think this is the same old story you've heard and seen several times before, a swift warning that ""The Musketeer"" is based on the novel by Dumas, not an exact interpretation.The core element of the novel, a young, would be musketeer plays a pivotal role in stopping the Cardinal and his henchmen from stopping the Kings of England and France from signing a peace treaty is intact, but the rest of the story is hit and miss.Imagine a Sherlock Holmes movie in which Watson has only a cameo role in the film and you'll begin to have a good idea of where ""The Musketeer"" is heading.In screenwriter Gene Quintano's adaptation, D'Artagnan (Justin Chambers) witnesses the death of his parents and vows to become a Musketeer like his father before him. One of his father's friends trains D'Artagnan in the ways of all things Musketeer and by the time he arrives to Paris to join the King's elite fighting force, he is more than up to the challenge. Everything sounds fine so far, right? Well, here's where things get a bit complicated.The film doesn't bother with the three incidents in which D'Artagnan first encounters Athos, Aramis and Porthos, resulting in the three pals challenging him in three separate duels. Before D'Artagnan begins his first duel, a band of the Cardinal's men attack and are easily defeated by the musketeers and their newfound friend. Instead, D'Artagnan simply meets Aramis and Porthos who are hard at work on reaching the bottom of their wine bottles while he runs into Athos in a bar, which would could conclude from the film is the Musketeer's sole hangout. Worse, D'Artagnan has to convince the others to assist him in protecting the King, the Musketeer's sworn duty.By forgoing the pivotal meetings and subsequent battle where the musketeers befriend D'Artagnan, the audience is asked to buy into too much, specifically that the proud musketeers would follow a lowly, albeit brave, commoner.Also rather hastily paced is D'Artagnan's romance of one of the Queen's handmaidens, Constance (Mena Suvari). The relationship is so poorly developed that it feels like Quinatno threw it in at the last minute as opposed to it being a pivotal aspect of the film.For the most part, the cast seems overwhelmed by their roles, but that could probably be more attributed to Quinatno's script, which assumes you know enough of the musketeer lore and are more than familiar with the characters.Catherine Deneuve handles her role as the courageous Queen of France perfectly and Tim Roth (Febre, the Cardinal's main henchman) as always is superb in the villain role. Roth practically carries the movie on his own and at least makes you care when he finally gets his comeuppance.Chambers is merely adequate as D'Artagnan, but it may be fairer to say the script doesn't give him a lot to work with in terms of really capturing the hearts of the audience.The film's advertising focuses heavily on the fact that Hong Kong choreographer Xin Xin Xiong designed the fight sequences.Director Peter Hyams does an outstanding job capturing all the action and keeps the movie moving at an even pace. The fights are indeed dazzling, but make up such a minimal part of the movie that they're not as epic as the commercials would lead you to believe.The costumes make it hard to distinguish who's who when there's more than two people fighting on the screen at one time as well.Remember how everyone began using ""The Matrix""-type special effects after the success of the 1999 Keanu Reeves action film? With the raves of the fight scenes in ""Crouching Tiger: Hidden Dragon,"" don't be surprised if mid-air flights become commonplace on the big screen. There are some moments when you may experience d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, but for the most part, the action scenes are completely original.""The Musketeer"" is a movie with great action, effects and a likable cast that's just begging for a better story to replace the script, providing a new look at Dumas' classic that no one was clamoring for.

Thurlow,"[0, 0]","""The Three Musketeers"" has been a Hollywood movie staple for decades.  2001's ""The Musketeer"" attempted to update the swashbuckling with the latest in special effect and martial arts, and a very tight focus on the character of D'Artagnon and a minimalist retelling of the traditional story.Justin Chambers plays D'Artagnon as a hunky super-warrior, capable of fantastic feats of martial arts and swordsmanship on par with ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""  The plot is downplayed in favor of a series of spectacular fights in bars, palaces, and on ropes and ladders.  The fight scenes are exciting, but the lack of plot to link the fights may become a distraction for those familiar with the original story.  The plot complication involving the English Duke of Buckingham and the French Queen, for example, is portrayed in a confusing manner, while the three Musketeers seem to have little to do in the story.  Only Tim Roth as the Cardinal's evil henchman gets a lot of screen, most of that opposite young Artagnon in the fight scenes.  The young and attractive Mena Suvari portrays the Queen's handmaiden and D'Artagnon's love interest, but she plays the role as a rather modern feminist, a little out of synch with D'Artagon's more traditional gallantry.  Catherine Deneuve as the Queen just looks uncomfortable in the role.  It isn't clear why the Duke of Buckingham would have risked an international scandal for her.This isn't a terrible movie, but viewers should not expect a traditional telling of ""The Three Musketeers.""",2,Off-target...,1198108800,"12 20, 2007",2007,1529,"['Three', 'Musketeers', 'been', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'staple', 'decades', '2001', 'Musketeer', 'attempted', 'update', 'swashbuckling', 'latest', 'special', 'effect', 'martial', 'arts', 'very', 'tight', 'focus', 'character', ""D'Artagnon"", 'minimalist', 'retelling', 'traditional', 'story.Justin', 'Chambers', ""D'Artagnon"", 'hunky', 'super-warrior', 'capable', 'fantastic', 'feats', 'martial', 'arts', 'swordsmanship', 'par', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'plot', 'downplayed', 'favor', 'series', 'spectacular', 'fights', 'bars', 'palaces', 'ropes', 'ladders', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'exciting', 'lack', 'plot', 'link', 'fights', 'may', 'become', 'distraction', 'familiar', 'original', 'story', 'plot', 'complication', 'involving', 'English', 'Duke', 'Buckingham', 'French', 'Queen', 'example', 'portrayed', 'confusing', 'manner', 'three', 'Musketeers', 'seem', 'have', 'little', 'do', 'story', 'Only', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'Cardinal', 'evil', 'henchman', 'lot', 'screen', 'most', 'opposite', 'young', 'Artagnon', 'fight', 'scenes', 'young', 'attractive', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'Queen', 'handmaiden', ""D'Artagnon"", 'love', 'interest', 'role', 'rather', 'modern', 'feminist', 'little', 'synch', ""D'Artagon"", 'more', 'traditional', 'gallantry', 'Catherine', 'Deneuve', 'Queen', 'just', 'uncomfortable', 'role', ""n't"", 'clear', 'why', 'Duke', 'Buckingham', 'would', 'have', 'risked', 'international', 'scandal', 'her.This', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'movie', 'viewers', 'should', 'not', 'expect', 'traditional', 'telling', 'Three', 'Musketeers']",N/A

586058,A28ILXH590CMRJ,B00005JKE0,Hazen B Markoe,"[4, 4]","Alexandre Dumas' classic novel of swashbuckling derring-do, ""The Three Musketeers"" has long been a favorite of film-makers ever since the silent days of Douglas Fairbanks.  From the definitive version with Michael York, Oliver Reed and Faye Dunaway to the extremely campy Disney version with Tim Curry and Charlie Sheen, this tale never ceases to entertain. This latest version uses the old revenge sub-plot in which young D'artagnan (Justin Chambers) not only seeks to become a Musketeer, but avenge his parents' murder at the hands of the villianous Febre' (Tim Roth). In an attempt to ""freshen up"" the classic adventure, director Peter Hyams uses the classic fight choreography of martial arts specialist Xin-Xin Xiong.  In that regard, the movie is a success as the fight sequences are quite amazing.  However, the screenplay ignores the rich characters of Dumas' plot while basically reducing the classic trio of Athos, Porthos and Aramis to little more than minor supporting roles.  If the role of D'artagnan had been played by a strong actor, it might've worked.  However, a rather bland and flat performance by Justin Chambers in the lead as the heroic D'artagnan nearly sinks the entire enterprise.  While he looks the part and handles the action scenes well, Chambers seems to have left all emotion on the cutting-room floor. As a result, Mena Suvari tries hard as his love interest, but has nowhere to go. As for the other Musketeers, only Steven Spiers as Porthos comes across with any sense of depth.  Jean-Pierre Castaldi provides light humor as the wry mentor/servant Planchet.  Catherine Deneuve is a regal delight as the Queen, while Stephen Rea is solid in his role as the crafty Cardinal Richeleu.  Tim Roth is sneering perfection as the sinister Febre', despite the fact that his eyepatch has long become a cliche' in Musketeer filmmaking.  Hyams directs the whole thing with a sure hand and is mostly successful in presenting the time period of the story.  It's a shame that Chamber's performance drags this film down so much as this flick had a lot of potential. If you enjoy fight choreography, I do recommend this film.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Fourteen years after his parents were murdered D'Artagnan arrives in Paris to pursue his dream of becoming a King's Royal Musketeer. That sentence alone should cue readers of Alexander Dumas's THE THREE MUSKETEERS that this film is very much a loose adaptation. There are perhaps three truly extreme departures. The presence of the menacing Febre (Tim Roth). The absence of Milady de Winter. And D'Artagnan's fighting style which is a more dynamic sort of fencing as done by Hong Kong cinema. Purists will certainly be up in arms. I ain't mad at them.And yet some things remain the same. Young D'Artagnan is still dashing and daring and a fierce stickler for honor. The Musketeers are still fiercely loyal to the King, in fact, so loyal that they've fallen out of favor, what with the crafty Cardinal Richelieu pulling political strings, widening his sphere of influence while sapping the King's power base. In Paris D'Artagnan meets up with what's left of the Musketeers, and these are a pretty slovenly lot of swordsmen. Whoever wrote the screenplay plays fast and loose with the source material. Maybe he only read the cliff notes. D'Artagnan still romances the Queen's lovely chamber maid (a listless Mena Suvari). There's still that intrigue with Lord Buckingham and a secret mission for the Queen. This time, though, the Queen (Catherine Deneuve) herself goes along for the ride, masquerading as a peasant woman.You scan the credits and you may notice Catherine Deneuve, Stephen Rea, and Tim Roth's names scrolling up. That's an exalted supporting cast, except that, really, only Tim Roth makes an impression as the skeevy eye-patched Febre. Roth really does excel at oozing sheer malice (just check out ROB ROY). However, Stephen Rea, who's best at roles in which he can internalize, isn't quite a showy enough presence to pass as Richelieu. And I guess they got it right with titling the film THE MUSKETEER, because the story hones in on D'Artagnan, almost to the exclusion of his fellow Musketeers. Aramis, Athos and Porthos, even more than ever, are reduced to glorified sidekick status. I did enjoy Nick Moran as Aramis, though.The many moments of derring-do are gratifying, and there's a sense that the story is sacrificed in service of the hard-charging action. I don't know how much of his own stunts were performed by lead actor Justin Chambers. I'm thinking not many, but these are still pretty astonishing stunts. Gene Kelly, when he played D'Artagnan in 1948, performed some excellent tumbling while dueling but his version never approached the sheer athleticism and dazzle of this D'Artagnan. Justin Chambers (or his stunt double) is a whirling dervish, swordfighting with flair and fury, and executing some frenetic gymnastics. As one character observes to D'Artagnan: ""You have an interesting fighting style."" Except I'm fairly certain fencing in 17th century France didn't involve wire work.Still, Gene Kelly's THE THREE MUSKETEERS is loads better than this one. Heck, even the Charlie Sheen version was better. And for the best film adaptation, you need to get your hands on Richard Lester's THE THREE MUSKETEERS (1973). Regarding THE MUSKETEER, see it, if you must, for the cool fighty fights and maybe for the bits of snark peppered throughout. 2.5 stars out of 5 for this one.",3,"""You have an interesting fighting style.""",1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,3302,"['Fourteen', 'years', 'parents', 'were', 'murdered', ""D'Artagnan"", 'Paris', 'pursue', 'dream', 'becoming', 'King', 'Royal', 'Musketeer', 'sentence', 'alone', 'should', 'cue', 'readers', 'Alexander', 'Dumas', 'THE', 'THREE', 'MUSKETEERS', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'loose', 'adaptation', 'are', 'perhaps', 'three', 'truly', 'extreme', 'departures', 'presence', 'menacing', 'Febre', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'absence', 'Milady', 'de', 'Winter', ""D'Artagnan"", 'fighting', 'style', 'more', 'dynamic', 'sort', 'fencing', 'done', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'cinema', 'Purists', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'up', 'arms', 'ai', ""n't"", 'mad', 'them.And', 'yet', 'things', 'remain', 'same', 'Young', ""D'Artagnan"", 'still', 'dashing', 'daring', 'fierce', 'stickler', 'honor', 'Musketeers', 'are', 'still', 'fiercely', 'loyal', 'King', 'fact', 'so', 'loyal', ""'ve"", 'fallen', 'favor', 'what', 'crafty', 'Cardinal', 'Richelieu', 'pulling', 'political', 'strings', 'widening', 'sphere', 'influence', 'sapping', 'King', 'power', 'base', 'Paris', ""D'Artagnan"", 'up', 'what', 'left', 'Musketeers', 'are', 'pretty', 'slovenly', 'lot', 'swordsmen', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'fast', 'loose', 'source', 'material', 'Maybe', 'only', 'read', 'cliff', 'notes', ""D'Artagnan"", 'still', 'Queen', 'lovely', 'chamber', 'maid', 'listless', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'still', 'intrigue', 'Lord', 'Buckingham', 'secret', 'mission', 'Queen', 'time', 'though', 'Queen', 'Catherine', 'Deneuve', 'along', 'ride', 'masquerading', 'peasant', 'scan', 'credits', 'may', 'notice', 'Catherine', 'Deneuve', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'names', 'scrolling', 'up', 'exalted', 'supporting', 'cast', 'really', 'only', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'impression', 'skeevy', 'eye-patched', 'Febre', 'Roth', 'really', 'excel', 'oozing', 'sheer', 'malice', 'just', 'check', 'out', 'ROB', 'ROY', 'However', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'who', 'best', 'roles', 'can', 'internalize', ""n't"", 'quite', 'showy', 'enough', 'presence', 'pass', 'Richelieu', 'guess', 'got', 'right', 'titling', 'film', 'THE', 'MUSKETEER', 'story', 'hones', ""D'Artagnan"", 'almost', 'exclusion', 'fellow', 'Musketeers', 'Aramis', 'Athos', 'Porthos', 'even', 'more', 'ever', 'are', 'reduced', 'glorified', 'sidekick', 'status', 'did', 'enjoy', 'Nick', 'Moran', 'Aramis', 'though.The', 'many', 'moments', 'derring-do', 'are', 'gratifying', 'sense', 'story', 'sacrificed', 'service', 'hard-charging', 'action', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', 'own', 'stunts', 'were', 'performed', 'lead', 'actor', 'Justin', 'Chambers', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'not', 'many', 'are', 'still', 'pretty', 'astonishing', 'stunts', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'when', 'played', ""D'Artagnan"", '1948', 'performed', 'excellent', 'tumbling', 'dueling', 'version', 'never', 'approached', 'sheer', 'athleticism', 'dazzle', ""D'Artagnan"", 'Justin', 'Chambers', 'stunt', 'double', 'whirling', 'dervish', 'swordfighting', 'flair', 'fury', 'executing', 'frenetic', 'gymnastics', 'one', 'character', ""D'Artagnan"", 'have', 'interesting', 'fighting', 'style', ""'m"", 'fairly', 'certain', 'fencing', '17th', 'century', 'France', 'did', ""n't"", 'involve', 'wire', 'work.Still', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'THE', 'THREE', 'MUSKETEERS', 'loads', 'better', 'one', 'Heck', 'even', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'version', 'was', 'better', 'best', 'film', 'adaptation', 'need', 'get', 'hands', 'Richard', 'Lester', 'THE', 'THREE', 'MUSKETEERS', '1973', 'Regarding', 'THE', 'MUSKETEER', 'see', 'must', 'cool', 'fighty', 'fights', 'maybe', 'bits', 'snark', 'peppered', '2.5', 'stars', '5', 'one']",N/A

So you say I should see your movie because it's the same choreographer doing YOUR fights as The Matrix - now I'm intrigued.  Then you hire Tim Roth, who is a God among actors. And now I'm hooked.  OH YES PLEASE MAY I SEE YOUR MOVIE ?Then you do 4 VERY bad things.1) YOU SPEND NO MONEY ON CINEMATOGRAPHY.  Whoever lit this movie should be shaken . . . repeatedly.  Somebody thought it would be artistic to film this movie in ""Natural Lighting"".  Too bad that some of the scenes are so damn dark you can't see anything at all.  You guys were WAY too interested in making pretty shots and not at all interested in whether or not I can actually SEE them.2) YOUR EDITOR IS PROBABLY THREE.  No, that's insulting to toddlers everywhere.  Whomever it was that put this film together has issues - he/she must be spastic.  It's great that you put in all these wonderful fight scenes - it's great that you used your entire budget to choreograph everything, but at least film the stupid movie so that I can watch the scenes without the camera moving angles 57 times.  It was jarring.  You see the fight from one angle - something cool happens - then the camera abruptly cuts to a face shot.  Action is flying everywhere BUT THEY'RE FILMING THE LOOK ON THE ACTOR'S FACE.  WHY?????  WHY?????  Trust me, the acting wasn't good enough to warrant filming their faces!3) YOU HAVE NO SCRIPT.  Storyline-wise, you have a bunch of drunken, disorderly Musketeers who are very sad because the king has disbanded them.  Suddenly, just because the hero says so, they all follow him like rats and the Pied Piper!  Wheeeeee!  Wish life was that easy.  And the dialogue . . . don't get me started.4) YOU WASTE TIM ROTH.  In reality, you had a pretty good cast.  But when you give them no script, don't inspire them, and under-pay them, they give wooden performances.  And you wonder why?  The only interesting actor among them was Tim Roth, and his lines were so cruddy that it was difficult to appreciate him.  That's just heinous - sinful.  Bad.This movie was such an abomination, and to think I actually looked forward to it.  Please, Please don't make another movie like this EVER again.

It's very rushed and the script is as flat as a blown-out tire. I mean it's written by the guy who created the Police Academy franchise. Surely he should be blacklisted in Hollywood by now.Peter Hyams once again becomes his own cinematographer and does a kinda okay job. None of his trademark flair or wonderful use of widescreen is in this film and nothing really comes across as pretty or atmospheric. And this whole deal with the film apparently having an Eastern influence is total nonsense. There is like 2 fight scenes and neither of them are that spectacular and come across as a bit contrived. Just because an Asian guy did the choreography it doesn't mean that this film has to look like The Matrix.The actors do what they can with the poor story and limp dialogue but still come across as being bored, especially Stepehen Rea. Tim Roth looks and acts like a cross between Chuck Norris and Charles Dance and his character is a bit of a clich&eacute;. 'The Man in Black'...puh-lease. And if you're kinda wondering who that is playing Mena Suvari's evil uncle then you might recognise him as Arthur Fowler from long over-running BBC1 misery and despair soap Eastenders.The Musketeer also seems to be badly edited around the PG-rating. Obviously this is what the studio wanted to aim for but it just seem right given the tone of the film and any scene in which someone dies looks like a badly staged pantomime.

586067,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JKE0,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 1]","&quot;The Musketeer&quot; is a dark telling of the Alexander Dumas classic &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;; not dark in the sense of brooding and foreboding, but dark in the sense that most of the scenes are under lit big time.  My guess is that it is easier to hide the wirework under such circumstances, but maybe director Peter Hyams thought he was being artistic.The hook with this film is that the fight choreographer is by Xin-Xin Xiong (who also does stunt work for Tim Roth's character in the climatic fight).  This is clearly going to be a make it or break it issue for most viewers, as to whether they are going to buy Hong Kong action sequences in a film with King Louis XIII.  I am open to such things in theory but reserve judgment until I see them in practice, and the first big sequence in the film is the best as D'Artagnan (Justin Chambers) takes on an inn full of swordsmen, fighting two or three at a time, while dodging over and dancing on barrels.  The initial part is pretty good, but then there is stuff involving the ceiling and the big fight at the finish is more about ladders than it is about swords (although the end is really an old school clich&eacute;).  So the action sequences are okay, given that the best one comes first.The part where I worried about &quot;The Musketeer&quot; is when the credit rolled and the names Catherine Deneue as the Queen, Mena Suvari as Francesca bon Ansau, Stephen Rea as Cardinal Richelieu, and Tim Roth as Febre the Man in Black, before we get to former Calvin Klein model Justin Chambers as D'Artagnan (good look, no act).  Now, Deneue is a big name but this is not her movie.  These first five names also make it very clear why the title of this film is not &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (there have been 20 of those anyway), because Aramis (Nick Moran), Porthos (Steve Speirs), and Athos (Jan Gregor Kremp) are just supporting characters in this version.  This leads us to the biggest problem with this film, which is that screenwriter Gene Quintano goes out of his way to make this story different. Maybe the assumption is that the target audience will not know the original story.  Besides making the other Musketeers minor characters, the biggest change is that Febre is now the major villain, breaking off the leash of Cardinal Richelieu, turning the master power politician into a sputtering bystander.  But once you throw out the book, why should a little thing like history concern anyone?Ultimately, &quot;The Musketeer&quot; is another one of those films where the trailer is better than the movie (maybe they should let the people who make the trailers make the movies).

We can only pray that we never see it this way again. This updated, revisionist version of the classic Alexander Dumas novel, ""The Three Musketeers"", manages to eviscerate the story without putting in its place anything interesting or entertaining. This is the kind of movie that gives historical epics a bad name.It's the early 1600s in France. D'Artagnan's [Justin Chambers] parents are killed in front of him when he is a little boy. He does manage to wound the assailant, who gets away. The kid vows to join the Musketeers, a group of swordsmen who protect the king of France, and find the killer. Fourteen years later, he arrives in Paris to fulfill his destiny. The Musketeers, however, aren't what they used to be. They sit around and drink a lot because the powerful Cardinal Richelieu has ordered them to stop doing their jobs. It seems the Cardinal [Stephen Rea] has plans to overthrow the king and also to instigate a war with England [or is it Spain?] D'Artagnan tries to rouse the lethargic Musketeers into helping him to save France from the Cardinal and his evil henchman, Febre [Tim Roth], who also happens to be the man our hero is looking for. It takes D'Artagnan most of the movie to figure out who Febre is, possibly because he spends much of his time pursuing the lovely Francesca [Mena Suvari].I've noted in past reviews how tricky it is to make a good historical epic. Accuracy has to be altered somewhat to make the movie understandable and/or entertaining. ""The Musketeers"" manages to throw out all historical truths and still not be fun, plausible or very comprehensible. The movie portrays the king, Louis XIII, as weak and Richelieu as a power hungry back stabber. In fact, Richelieu was France's Prime Minister and the king's ally against the French Huguenots and, for that matter, most of the rest of Europe. He thwarted plots against the throne rather than instigated them. The movie portrays the king as such a foolish fop that it's easy to see the Musketeers as not even wanting to go back to work. All this makes D'Atagnan's attempts to rouse them seem somewhat unbelievable.Someone decided it would be cool to bring in a famous Chinese martial arts choreographer to stage a lot of Kung Fu style fights, a la ""Couching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". This requires the actors to do a lot of jumping around, doing stuff that was as physically impossible then as it is today. These stunts work in a movie that is surreal or is just plain fun, but ""The Musketeer"" is so dark and plodding that these sequences seem tacked on and very obviously staged. Instead of being exhilarating, they are, for the most part, simply irritating.The acting ranges from mediocre to dreadful. There are some fine actors here [Roth, Suvari, Stephen Rea, Catherine Deneuve], but they seem bored with that's going on. Chambers seems to have few acting skills. If he's lucky, he can fill in after Steven Segal retires.Coincidentally, I have seen two other historical epics recently, both of which were great. One is ""The Count of Monte Cristo"", which has wonderful acting and a script that places story and character over action. The other is ""The Brotherhood of the Wolf"", a French film with tons of marvelously choreographed fight scenes, many of them also with a Far East flavor. Neither of them is on DVD yet.

From the first, the stunts might have been cool, but the editing of the fighting scenes is so bad they are unappreciable, and it's often difficult to figure out what's going on. The whole ladder climax was so blatantly [borrowed] from Great Hero From China that even that couldn't offer a tiny shred of redemption.The thing is just barely watchable. If this was made in 1985, it might make for a funny bad rental, but this thing came out in 2001! Bad direction, miserable acting, horrible editing, and one of the most ineptly written scripts equals one big stinkbomb from start to finish.First of all, the miscasting was at such a level it is hard to believe it wasn't deliberate. Justin Chambers is, frankly, horrible in this role; I can't hypothesize what kind of role in which he might not be horrible. All of the other actors and their characters are ludicrous and instantly forgettable, except for Tim Roth, who had the decency to be a goof off. Chambers' ""mentor"" reminded me of Andre the Giant's character from the Princess Bride, and we never get to understand how this supposedly incredible swordfighter kid was trained by an overweight guy with bad lungs who rarely moves.The script was just appalling. The ""wooing"" scenes between Chambers and Suvari were, of course, miserably acted, but the dialogue itself was just embarrassing. You will cringe. The overall plot is ridiculously superficial, yet they still manage to make it a total mess of head-scratchingly bad ideas. That Cardinal Richelieu would have ever hatched plots of such idiocy is inconceivable. He was a schemer to the core, which Dumas always portrayed wonderfully, but ultimately his schemes were designed to enhance the power of the throne and his authority over the king, not undermine it and try and get countries to declare war on France. There's no point listing the rest of its absurdities.Although this was billed as a quasi-martial arts flick, there are really only a few genuine fight scenes, and again, they are badly edited (way too many confusing cuts and obvious speed-motion edits) and it's pretty clear that Chambers did almost none of his own stunts. Hyams should not be directing action flicks.The music poorly corresponded to anything on screen, and since I hate this movie, I might as well hate the music too. It was dreadful. Also, the transfer to VHS was awful; for the first half-hour it looked dullish and yellow, and everything sounded flat. Maybe the DVD is better.Dumas' original ""The Three Musketeers"" was obviously a wonderful novel, but none of the hilarious interplay between the Musketeers manages to find a way into the script. Aramis, Porthos, and Athos were instead lifeless dolts with no wit, even for the little time they were on screen.

This film bears no resemblance to any of Dumas' works, nor any of the earlier film versions (at least 7), which were tailored either to the leading man/lady or the director's whimsy. I really enjoyed all the crazy swordplay, being a Jackie Chan fan.  The homage to Shanghai Noon, with flying ladders and wild-eyed, one eyed villain, was great fun.Richard Lester's classic retelling starred English and American actors, none of whom had French accents, and it was not harmed by the Cockney-speaking peasants either.  Les Mis doesn't have the first glimmer of a French accent, and it was written in French!  Lighten up!When such divers actors as Gene Kelly, Lana Turner, The Ritz Brothers and Chris O'Donnell get away with making films titled The Three Musketeers, no one is in a position to complain when Peter Hyams borrows a familiar character to spin a new tale.  Read the entire Three Musketeers trilogy by Dumas (3M, Twenty Years Later, Ten Years After) and don't look for much, if any, resemblance to the celluloid versions.The scruffy costumes of the disenfranchised Musketeers, the elaborate court dress, and the (back to Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon) use of torches and candles to light indoor scenes was useful window dressing, but who really cares if it was filmed in Luxembourg, France or Grand Fenwick?I was amused but not impressed.

This is easily the worst big budget Hollywood film made in the last five years. Yes, the trailer was awesome, and had many a moviegoer drueling to see what the Three Musketeers would be like with some Hong Kong flavor to spice things up, but the movie itself is complete and utter filth.Where does one begin? First of all, the much-touted choreography is hardly anything but a cameo in this picture. Action sequences are sparse and everything good was on the aforementioned trailer. Wirework is excessive to the point where it seems that gravity is non-existent. The actors don't seem to want to be IN this film either, which is clearly reflected by their pained facial expressions as they deliver their incoherent dialogue. Even the cinematography is bad - sometimes it's too bloody dark to even see what's going on! And don't expect to see much of the Three Musketeers here either. They're bit parts, if that, and severely disrespected at every turn by the hero who should look up to them.This film has got some bad press, but not half as much as it deserves. If you want some Dumas, go watch the far superior Count of Monte Cristo. If you want some musketeer action, check out the 1998 adaptation of The Man in the Iron Mask.

586079,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JKE0,Robert Moore,"[2, 3]","By any standard, this is a very strange movie.  The fight scenes are quite remarkable, but because they seem more appropriate in THE MATRIX or CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON or, even, SHREK, they seem bizarrely out of place in this film.  They also make the rest of the film look all that much worse than it would have otherwise.  It is worth noting that the fight scenes were the product of Xin Xin Xiong, whose background is in Asian martial arts films.Numerous reviewers have noted the absurdity of the script, especially in that it changes the story of Alexandre Dumas.  To tell the truth, the original story isn't so terribly special that some emendation is out of order.  The trouble is that the changes that are introduced do not produce a good story.  So, it is quite true that one of the great faults of the film is a very bad script.A more serious problem is the acting, especially in several of the key roles.  Based on his wooden, monotone performance in this film (an amazing achievement considering all the action in this one), Justin Chambers would have to compete for the title of the world's worst actor.  The only other thing I have seen him in was THE WEDDING PLANNER, in which he was the most irritating element as Jennifer Lopez's would-be Italian fiance.  He was bad in that, but he is far, far worse in this film.  Tim Roth is a talented guy, but has anyone noticed how many bad films he is in?  And how many ham roles he gets?  Basically, his role in this film is essentially a rehash of his Oscar-nominated role in ROB ROY.  Stephen Rea is more or less wasted as Cardinal Richelieu.  The portrayal of Richelieu in films has always perplexed me.  He is almost universally portrayed as a villain, and yet he is easily one of the most important figures in French political history, providing important national leadership at a time of crisis in the monarchy.  Certainly he was not any more ruthless than many other strong national leaders in the seventeenth century.  Mena Suvari is not cut out for costume pictures, and while she seems perfectly in her element in AMERICAN BEAUTY and the AMERICAN PIE films, she just doesn't belong here.The film did look good, and whoever was in chart of art direction did a bang up job.

586083,ADLN37B0153N,B00005JKE0,Silmarwen,"[3, 5]","Cardinal Richelieu (Stephen Rea), in his quest to become the premier power in France, disbands the king's musketeers and does his best to wipe them out, discretely, of course.  One of the musketeers killed was D'Artagnan's (Justin Chambers) father and D'Artagnan vows to avenge his father's death and kill the man in black (Tim Roth).  D'Artagnan grows up and begins his quest for vengeance by traveling to Paris and contacting the musketeers.  Unfortunately, he fails his test and instead finds himself aiding the Queen (Catherine Deneuve) in a desperate attempt to avoid war with Great Britain.  Along the way, D'Artagnan falls in love with Francesca bon Ansau (Mena Suvari) and gradually earns the respect of the musketeers.I quite enjoyed this version of the Three Musketeers, but I would have to agree with other reviewers in that it is not the best version that I have seen.  The strength of this movie is the amazing fighting sequences.  Whether it is a barroom brawl with the fighters dancing over barrels, an attempt to take over the Queen's coach that leaps from coach to horse to ground, or a winner take all fight on ropes and ladders, the fighting sequences are fresh, original and oftentimes, simply amazing.  The costumes and scenery were gorgeous, with the director Peter Hymans' fabulous use of natural light to give the whole film a faded, sepia toned look that really suited the time period.  The supporting cast was quite good, including a deliciously evil man in black played by Tim Roth and an understated, yet humorous musketeer trio played by Nick Moran (Aramis), Steven Spiers (Porthos) and Jan Gregor Kremp (Athos).  The absolute worst part of the film was Justin Chambers, who, unfortunately played D'Artagnan and was in just about every scene.

In fact, it would have made a perfect parody if it were funny. The script appears to have been a phone in, if that. Every plot point and piece of dialog here is really just an excuse to get to another fighting or otherwise monotonous action sequence. And the fighting scenes are about exactly what you'd expect from seemingly having had about 10 minutes total spent on each of them (2 minutes = choreography, 2 minutes = rehearsal, 6 minutes = filming). Also, if you are looking for breaks in this block of writing that would be meant to represent new paragraphs, you aren't going to find them. Uh uh, not here, this is a concept piece-- I plan on putting just as much effort into this review as the entire crew put into the making of The Musketeer. Anyhoo, moving on. The score, the score, the score...the score is...um, how do you say...dog [explitive deleted]. No, no, no, that's not true, my dog could probably take a [explitive deleted] more passionate than this film's score. Now, I have a confession to make, I cry during motion pictures. Action, comedy, drama, it really doesn't matter, show me emotions and I will show you a little dampness around the eyes. That little bit of unpleasantness disclosed, I didn't shed a single tear during The Musketeer. Casting? Well, you know, it has Mena Suvari, you can't really go wrong there-- but what about the lead, you ask? Well he was a model plucked from Calvin Klein ads. Says the director (also male): ""I spent a couple of hours alone with him and decided he was perfect for the role."" Well, I think that pretty much sums that up. Not to say that the movie is homosexual or is in any trying to be representative of homosexuals. Oh hades no, if that were the case GLAAD would have sued them for misrepresentation.

All scenes are intact, with all pickup shots (close-ups, transitionary moments, shots of what the actor is looking at, shots of things unseen by the regular camera that are neccessary to let the audience know what is going unseen).THE MUSKETEER is not a great film. It is a good film that is missing many elements that could have made it a GREAT film.THE MUSKETEER is an interesting movie with nice - yeah just NICE - action sequences. Much more could have been accomplished as I found that these ""action"" scenes were fairly predictable.The acting is decent yet could have used a little more gusto. The characters seem to take way too many things for granted, leaving much unexplained in the sense that everyone knows all about the reasoning behind the motivation and why things are happening... This portrays the entire cast as shallow vessels, and opens up the can of worms reminding the audience that this is JUST a movie.I believe the following problems lead to the boredom I found myself enraptured within while viewing the second and third parts of the film (even though the beginning was pretty lame).THE SCORE. Where is the thrill? I believe that with a much better score that drove the action and story, this film could have been much better.THE MISSING SCENES. Near the middle of the film it is hinted that the lead, D'ARTAGNAN, has a history with his horse. We have seen no evidence of this. The writers and directors could have incorporated a short scene showing how D'artagnan bonds with the horse who becomes a companion and friend to him. The first time we see the horse, he is tagged to the back of the wagon fighting to keep up as they race away from the bad guys.There are also several moments - pick ups - that are missing. I think the director went after a ""Quick CUT"" style for this movie to keep the action flowing. This film, however, is not suited for such a drastic style. Transitions and little things that are missing throw the audience off guard, as we are suddenly in the midst of another scene of dialogue or action. This happens too many times throughout the film and makes me wonder if they just ran out of time/budget and cut together what was done and left it at that. NOT A GOOD THING.THE DVD EXTRAS. Laughable. Redundant. Laughable. Redundant. There is the ""Production notes"" which are simply a type-up of all the words spoken in all of the video extras which include, ""Casting Justin Chambers"" - a sixty second clip of the model-turned-actor talking about the movie and how it was a great experience. Then there is ""The Stunts"" - a less than five minute dialogue with the director talking about the wonders of the Stunt Coordinator, with nearly all of the ""Casting Justin Chambers"" footage clipped in as filler. The ""Theatrical Trailer"" is amusing in how they sliced and diced the more interesting aspects of the film into a promo piece that outshines the film itself. And why in the world do they bother to put ""Widescreen anamorphic format"" on there anyway? It is NOT an extra. It is the format of the film that - in my opinion - should be the only format they allow.A good film? Yeah.A great experience? No.A good plot? Sure.Good sound? Heck NO!A good rental? Maybe...Should you buy it? I do not encourage you.All for one and one for all? Nope.Overall, 3 stars is a generous rating. I enjoyed moments of this film. I am glad I did not waste my money in the theatres watching it. This is a film that had great potential but became a shallow, empty tale due to shoddy sound, editing, and lack of thoroughness.",3,Where is the rest of the film?,1060300800,"08 8, 2003",2003,3701,"['GREAT', 'FILMS', 'director/producers', 'take', 'time', 'ensure', 'movie', 'good', 'plays', 'good', 'good', 'audience', 'web', 'wonder', 'scenes', 'are', 'intact', 'pickup', 'shots', 'close-ups', 'transitionary', 'moments', 'shots', 'what', 'actor', 'looking', 'shots', 'things', 'unseen', 'regular', 'camera', 'are', 'neccessary', 'let', 'audience', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'unseen', '.THE', 'MUSKETEER', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'good', 'film', 'missing', 'many', 'elements', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'GREAT', 'film.THE', 'MUSKETEER', 'interesting', 'movie', 'nice', 'yeah', 'just', 'NICE', 'action', 'sequences', 'Much', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'accomplished', 'found', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'fairly', 'predictable.The', 'acting', 'decent', 'yet', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'little', 'more', 'gusto', 'characters', 'seem', 'take', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'granted', 'leaving', 'much', 'unexplained', 'sense', 'everyone', 'reasoning', 'motivation', 'why', 'things', 'are', 'happening', 'entire', 'cast', 'shallow', 'vessels', 'up', 'can', 'worms', 'reminding', 'audience', 'JUST', 'movie.I', 'believe', 'following', 'problems', 'lead', 'boredom', 'found', 'enraptured', 'viewing', 'second', 'third', 'parts', 'film', 'even', 'beginning', 'was', 'pretty', 'lame', 'SCORE', 'Where', 'thrill', 'believe', 'much', 'better', 'score', 'drove', 'action', 'story', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better.THE', 'MISSING', 'SCENES', 'middle', 'film', 'hinted', 'lead', ""D'ARTAGNAN"", 'history', 'horse', 'have', 'seen', 'evidence', 'writers', 'directors', 'could', 'have', 'incorporated', 'short', 'scene', 'showing', 'how', ""D'artagnan"", 'bonds', 'horse', 'who', 'companion', 'friend', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'horse', 'tagged', 'back', 'wagon', 'fighting', 'keep', 'up', 'race', 'away', 'bad', 'guys.There', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'moments', 'pick', 'ups', 'are', 'missing', 'think', 'director', 'went', 'Quick', 'CUT', 'style', 'movie', 'keep', 'action', 'flowing', 'film', 'however', 'not', 'suited', 'such', 'drastic', 'style', 'Transitions', 'little', 'things', 'are', 'missing', 'audience', 'off', 'guard', 'are', 'suddenly', 'midst', 'scene', 'dialogue', 'action', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'film', 'wonder', 'just', 'ran', 'time/budget', 'cut', 'together', 'what', 'was', 'done', 'left', 'NOT', 'GOOD', 'THING.THE', 'DVD', 'EXTRAS', 'Laughable', 'Redundant', 'Laughable', 'Redundant', 'Production', 'notes', 'are', 'simply', 'type-up', 'words', 'spoken', 'video', 'extras', 'include', 'Casting', 'Justin', 'Chambers', 'sixty', 'second', 'clip', 'model-turned-actor', 'talking', 'movie', 'how', 'was', 'great', 'experience', 'Then', 'Stunts', 'less', 'five', 'minute', 'dialogue', 'director', 'talking', 'wonders', 'Stunt', 'Coordinator', 'nearly', 'Casting', 'Justin', 'Chambers', 'footage', 'clipped', 'filler', 'Theatrical', 'Trailer', 'amusing', 'how', 'sliced', 'diced', 'more', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'film', 'promo', 'piece', 'film', 'why', 'world', 'do', 'bother', 'put', 'Widescreen', 'anamorphic', 'format', 'anyway', 'NOT', 'extra', 'format', 'film', 'opinion', 'should', 'be', 'only', 'format', 'allow.A', 'good', 'film', 'Yeah.A', 'great', 'experience', 'No.A', 'good', 'plot', 'Sure.Good', 'sound', 'Heck', 'NO', 'good', 'rental', 'Maybe', 'Should', 'buy', 'do', 'not', 'encourage', 'you.All', 'one', 'one', 'Nope.Overall', '3', 'stars', 'generous', 'rating', 'enjoyed', 'moments', 'film', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'not', 'waste', 'money', 'theatres', 'watching', 'film', 'had', 'great', 'potential', 'became', 'shallow', 'empty', 'tale', 'due', 'shoddy', 'sound', 'editing', 'lack', 'thoroughness']",N/A

What I got was one of the few films I have ever wanted to walk out on.  This movie is bad.I love Hong Kong action films, and I have seen many an actor fly across the screen in wire-fu action.  Xin Xin Xiong is billed as a &quot;legendary&quot; fight master even though this is only the 3rd film he has choreographed.  A quick check shows that most of Xin Xin Xiong's career has been as an extra in various Jet Li films.  The ladder scene is remarkably similar to a scene in  &quot;Once Upon a Time in China.&quot; (Which was choreographed by Woo-ping Yuen of &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; fame.)  The rope scene on the tower is just silly.  (Why not just cut the ropes?) Hardly a &quot;legendary&quot; fight master.The acting is a bad as any I have ever seen.  Tim Roth, who is usually great, sleepwalks through the film.  What Justin Chambers does cannot really be called acting.  There is no plot.Yikes!  I could go on!  Rent at your own risk.
