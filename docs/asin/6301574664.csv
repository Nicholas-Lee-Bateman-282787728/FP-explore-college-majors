GRIPS, GRUNTS, AND GROANS and ALL THE WORLD'S A STOOGE are okay, but they both could've been better.However, 3 DUMB CLUCKS is a very funny short, especially with Curly playing two parts. There's a big clever mix-up toward the end. The scene where the Stooges fall 14 stories is funny. This short was remade with Shemp as UP IN DAISY'S PENTHOUSE (1953). I thought that one was funnier, but this one was also great.",3,All the World IS a Stooge.,1012348800,"01 30, 2002",2002,432,"['tape', 'okay', 'GRIPS', 'GRUNTS', 'AND', 'GROANS', 'ALL', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'STOOGE', 'are', 'okay', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better.However', '3', 'DUMB', 'CLUCKS', 'very', 'funny', 'short', 'especially', 'Curly', 'playing', 'two', 'parts', 'big', 'clever', 'mix-up', 'end', 'scene', 'where', 'Stooges', 'fall', '14', 'stories', 'funny', 'short', 'was', 'remade', 'Shemp', 'UP', 'IN', 'DAISY', 'PENTHOUSE', '1953', 'thought', 'one', 'was', 'funnier', 'one', 'was', 'also', 'great']",N/A
256226,A19Y68G415SW8G,6301574664,Paul Carruthers,"[0, 0]","Grips, Grunts and Groans - My second favorite Curly film after ""Disorder in the Court"" and one of the greatest pieces of comedy put to film. Curly's wrestling match alone is worth a 5 star rating & Harrison Greene as Bustoff is a riot. He should have been used in more shorts with the boys.All The World's A Stooge - Using the outlandish premise of the stooges as children, and who in their right mind would buy Larry as a little girl, but plausibility aside, this is another great one from their peak period of 1940-42. 4 1/2 stars3 Dumb Clucks - A good short, but I've always preferred the remake ""Up In Daisy's Penthouse"" with Shemp. It's faster paced and some of the slower scenes from ""Clucks"" such as the overlong ""shopping for a hat"" scene were replaced with funnier scenes. Still, it's a worthy entry in the Curly catalog. 4 starsOverall, this is a great tape that should please Curly Howard fans.",5,Good Curly fun...,1354924800,"12 8, 2012",2012,905,"['Grips', 'Grunts', 'Groans', 'second', 'favorite', 'Curly', 'film', 'Disorder', 'Court', 'one', 'greatest', 'pieces', 'comedy', 'put', 'film', 'Curly', 'wrestling', 'match', 'alone', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'Harrison', 'Greene', 'Bustoff', 'riot', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'more', 'shorts', 'boys.All', 'World', 'A', 'Stooge', 'Using', 'outlandish', 'premise', 'stooges', 'children', 'who', 'right', 'mind', 'would', 'buy', 'Larry', 'little', 'girl', 'plausibility', 'aside', 'great', 'one', 'peak', 'period', '1940-42', '4', '1/2', 'stars3', 'Dumb', 'Clucks', 'good', 'short', ""'ve"", 'always', 'preferred', 'remake', 'Daisy', 'Penthouse', 'Shemp', 'faster', 'paced', 'slower', 'scenes', 'Clucks', 'such', 'overlong', 'shopping', 'hat', 'scene', 'were', 'replaced', 'funnier', 'scenes', 'Still', 'worthy', 'entry', 'Curly', 'catalog', '4', 'starsOverall', 'great', 'tape', 'should', 'please', 'Curly', 'Howard', 'fans']",N/A

256228,A2PAKB0NYQLCSG,6301574664,Scott MacGillivray,"[0, 0]","ALL THE WORLD'S A STOOGE has some lowbrow dentist's-office comedy, followed by a sketch in which they have to impersonate &quot;refugee&quot; children. THREE DUMB CLUCKS is distinguished by Curly's dual role (as  himself and the Stooges' father); the Stooges try to prevent Pa from  remarrying. GRIPS, GRUNTS AND GROANS is the topper for this group of  shorts: Curly has to impersonate a professional wrestler! While these  titles are no classics, they're certainly typical of the comedians' heyday,  and fans will like them.",3,Standard Stooges stuff,956793600,"04 27, 2000",2000,525,"['WORLD', 'STOOGE', 'lowbrow', ""dentist's-office"", 'comedy', 'followed', 'sketch', 'have', 'impersonate', 'quot', 'refugee', 'quot', 'children', 'THREE', 'DUMB', 'CLUCKS', 'distinguished', 'Curly', 'dual', 'role', 'Stooges', 'father', 'Stooges', 'try', 'prevent', 'Pa', 'remarrying', 'GRIPS', 'GRUNTS', 'AND', 'GROANS', 'topper', 'group', 'shorts', 'Curly', 'impersonate', 'professional', 'wrestler', 'titles', 'are', 'classics', ""'re"", 'certainly', 'typical', 'comedians', 'heyday', 'fans', 'will', 'like']",N/A
256229,A1YMKX5D2WGCQ,6301574664,Stooge,"[3, 3]","GRIPS, GRUNTS AND GROANS (1937) is one of my top 5 personal favorite Stooge shorts.  This keeps me laughing every time.  I also love the man playing Bustoff, he's hilarious and works well with the boys.  He should've been in more shorts.  The final scene with Curly going crazy in the wrestling ring is excellent.  A Must see.ALL THE WORLD'S A STOOGE (1941) - A classic, with plenty of great scenes. The first half with the boys taking over the dentist office is great, and the second half with the boys posing as little kids was even better.  The ending was clever.3 DUMB CLUCKS (1937) - A very creative and funny short with Curly playing two parts - himself and as his father. The interaction and camera work in the scene with the Stooges talking to their father (Curly) is interesting.Viewers with careful eyes will notice Curly has a patch of hair on his head in several scenes in this short. You aren't seeing things - When they filmed the part where Curly (as his father) gets thrown down the elevataor shaft, Curly accidentally sliced his head open on a sharp object that was left in the shaft. He became unconscious and was rushed to the hospital immediately. After recovering, they used the patch of hair on Curly's head to hide his wound, but the patch of hair is too noticable on Curly's bald head.",5,"GRIPS, GRUNTS THE WORLD'S DUMB CLUCKS",994291200,"07 5, 2001",2001,1309,"['GRIPS', 'GRUNTS', 'GROANS', '1937', 'one', 'top', '5', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Stooge', 'laughing', 'time', 'also', 'love', 'man', 'playing', 'Bustoff', 'hilarious', 'well', 'boys', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'shorts', 'final', 'scene', 'Curly', 'going', 'crazy', 'wrestling', 'ring', 'excellent', 'Must', 'see.ALL', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'STOOGE', '1941', 'classic', 'plenty', 'great', 'scenes', 'first', 'half', 'boys', 'taking', 'dentist', 'office', 'great', 'second', 'half', 'boys', 'posing', 'as', 'little', 'kids', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'ending', 'was', 'clever.3', 'DUMB', 'CLUCKS', '1937', 'very', 'creative', 'funny', 'short', 'Curly', 'playing', 'two', 'parts', 'father', 'interaction', 'camera', 'work', 'scene', 'Stooges', 'talking', 'father', 'Curly', 'interesting.Viewers', 'careful', 'eyes', 'will', 'notice', 'Curly', 'patch', 'hair', 'head', 'several', 'scenes', 'short', 'are', ""n't"", 'seeing', 'things', 'When', 'filmed', 'part', 'where', 'Curly', 'father', 'thrown', 'down', 'elevataor', 'shaft', 'Curly', 'accidentally', 'sliced', 'head', 'open', 'sharp', 'object', 'was', 'left', 'shaft', 'became', 'unconscious', 'was', 'rushed', 'hospital', 'immediately', 'recovering', 'used', 'patch', 'hair', 'Curly', 'head', 'hide', 'wound', 'patch', 'hair', 'too', 'noticable', 'Curly', 'bald', 'head']",N/A
