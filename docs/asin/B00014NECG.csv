Growing up watching G.I. Joe I learned a lot about the kind of person I wanted to be.

793064,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00014NECG,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[24, 34]","As a youth I used to run home after school as well as awaken early Saturday mornings to enjoy this show about a ruthless villain hell-bent on terrorizing the world and the only organization strong enough to foil his plans daily.  To me it was the ultimate example of good vs. evil and no other program could top it.  It was the 80s, life was good and the G.I. Joes were the epitome of a young American boy's dream.Older now, I purchased this on a whim to see if I could see if I could recreate the joy that I felt as a child.  I wanted to revisit my old nemesis Cobra as well as catch one last glimpse of the elusive Lady Jay.  After watching all four discs of this release, I came to a conclusion that would be blind to a child, but very apparent to an adult.  The G.I. Joe organization is the classic business example of reactive vs. proactive.  If we were to define bot h the Joes and the Cobra teams, the Joes would definatly be reactive, while the Cobra organization would definitely be the proactive.  Each episode opens with the Joes relaxing or taking time off instead of doing what they should be, which is trying to destroy the Cobra threat from the world.  Sadly, the action does not start until Cobra initiates it by creating some imaginative and creative strategy to take over the world.  Then the battle ensues with the Joes always allowing Cobra Commander to leave without recourse.  They are never too excited about actually capturing the Commander, but instead that the citizens of the world are safe.  Do they not realize that if they were proactive and captured Cobra Commander immediately, the threat would be eliminated?This question leads me to my next revelation.  Is it possible that the reason that the Joes let Cobra go everytime is because without Cobra, Lady Jay, Hawk, Snake Eyes, and Roadblock would all be unemployed?  Could you imagine Quick Kick serving you some fries behind the counter of a McDonalds?  So, maybe Cobra needs the Joes as much as the Joes need Cobra.  They live together in a form of zen unity.  Ponder that for a moment.Also, it became clearer that as the episodes progressed how much of a sci-fi theme this series engulfed.  There was more than just regular battles, but lasers, huge machines that could control the weather, psychics, and even this strange little man known as the Gamesmaster (which is my FAVORITE episode in this set).  Watch it again and I think you will see the references that I speak about.When I was younger, G.I. Joe was my favorite cartoon and I couldn't wait to go outside and pretend that I was one of the Joes fighting the notorious Cobra.  Now, older and wiser, I cannot wait to play Cobra.  From a business sense they are aggressive, competitive, imaginative, and creative.  Daily they have new, fresh ideas on how to dominate the world while the Joes just wait around for Cobra to make their move.  I would have to side with Cobra in today's market.  I think you would as well.Overall, a very enjoyable series even revisited years later.  I am hoping to expand my collection to include the other sets as well, but to re-emerge myself into the series, this was the perfect opener!Go COBRA!!!!!!!Grade: ***** out of *****",5,A classic example of reactive vs. proactive.,1105574400,"01 13, 2005",2005,3202,"['youth', 'used', 'run', 'home', 'school', 'as', 'well', 'awaken', 'early', 'Saturday', 'mornings', 'enjoy', 'show', 'ruthless', 'villain', 'hell-bent', 'terrorizing', 'world', 'only', 'organization', 'strong', 'enough', 'foil', 'plans', 'daily', 'was', 'ultimate', 'example', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'other', 'program', 'could', 'top', 'was', '80s', 'life', 'was', 'good', 'G.I', 'Joes', 'were', 'epitome', 'young', 'American', 'boy', 'dream.Older', 'now', 'purchased', 'whim', 'see', 'could', 'see', 'could', 'recreate', 'joy', 'felt', 'child', 'wanted', 'revisit', 'old', 'nemesis', 'Cobra', 'as', 'well', 'catch', 'one', 'last', 'glimpse', 'elusive', 'Lady', 'Jay', 'watching', 'four', 'discs', 'release', 'came', 'conclusion', 'would', 'be', 'blind', 'child', 'very', 'apparent', 'adult', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'organization', 'classic', 'business', 'example', 'reactive', 'vs.', 'proactive', 'were', 'define', 'bot', 'Joes', 'Cobra', 'teams', 'Joes', 'would', 'definatly', 'be', 'reactive', 'Cobra', 'organization', 'would', 'definitely', 'be', 'proactive', 'episode', 'Joes', 'relaxing', 'taking', 'time', 'instead', 'doing', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'trying', 'destroy', 'Cobra', 'threat', 'world', 'Sadly', 'action', 'not', 'start', 'Cobra', 'creating', 'imaginative', 'creative', 'strategy', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'Then', 'battle', 'Joes', 'always', 'allowing', 'Cobra', 'Commander', 'leave', 'recourse', 'are', 'never', 'too', 'excited', 'actually', 'capturing', 'Commander', 'instead', 'citizens', 'world', 'are', 'safe', 'Do', 'not', 'realize', 'were', 'proactive', 'captured', 'Cobra', 'Commander', 'immediately', 'threat', 'would', 'be', 'eliminated', 'question', 'next', 'revelation', 'possible', 'reason', 'Joes', 'let', 'Cobra', 'go', 'everytime', 'Cobra', 'Lady', 'Jay', 'Hawk', 'Snake', 'Eyes', 'Roadblock', 'would', 'all', 'be', 'unemployed', 'Could', 'imagine', 'Quick', 'Kick', 'serving', 'fries', 'counter', 'McDonalds', 'So', 'maybe', 'Cobra', 'Joes', 'as', 'much', 'Joes', 'need', 'Cobra', 'live', 'together', 'form', 'zen', 'unity', 'Ponder', 'moment.Also', 'became', 'clearer', 'episodes', 'progressed', 'how', 'much', 'sci-fi', 'theme', 'series', 'engulfed', 'was', 'more', 'just', 'regular', 'battles', 'lasers', 'huge', 'machines', 'could', 'control', 'weather', 'psychics', 'even', 'strange', 'little', 'man', 'known', 'Gamesmaster', 'FAVORITE', 'episode', 'set', 'Watch', 'again', 'think', 'will', 'see', 'references', 'speak', 'about.When', 'was', 'younger', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'was', 'favorite', 'cartoon', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'go', 'outside', 'pretend', 'was', 'one', 'Joes', 'fighting', 'notorious', 'Cobra', 'Now', 'older', 'wiser', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'play', 'Cobra', 'business', 'sense', 'are', 'aggressive', 'competitive', 'imaginative', 'creative', 'Daily', 'have', 'new', 'fresh', 'ideas', 'how', 'dominate', 'world', 'Joes', 'just', 'wait', 'around', 'Cobra', 'make', 'move', 'would', 'have', 'side', 'Cobra', 'today', 'market', 'think', 'would', 'well.Overall', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'series', 'even', 'revisited', 'years', 'later', 'am', 'hoping', 'expand', 'collection', 'include', 'other', 'sets', 'well', 're-emerge', 'series', 'was', 'perfect', 'opener', 'Go', 'COBRA', 'Grade', '*****', '*****']",N/A

Yes, the colors are more vibrant, but in a way it takes away from the grittier, military feel of the show. They also seem to overlap some of the detail, almost like you are watching an animated coloring book with smaller color palette than the original style.Secondly, the line-up of episodes is all over the place on the timeline. It really makes me wonder who was in charge of that decision. I mean really, wouldn't have made more sense to, I don't know, maybe, KEEP THE EPISODES IN ORDER? It actually does disrupt the quality because some of the characters or story archs seem way out of place and don't align themselves with any kind of time continueum. Basically, you will be watching random episodes.Thirdly, the opening sequence is from the THIRD season. I can't fathom why they would do this.Still though, it is G.I JOE on DVD.

Slaughter, Dr. Mindbender etc. on this set's opening titles if we don't see them in the episodes?)But still...

793068,ATJLR5VAS2QE5,B00014NECG,Garrett Aja,"[42, 44]","With Rhino's remastering of The Transformers nearly complete, it should come as no surprise that their next target for a wide DVD release has been G.I. Joe. Often considered to be the best of the toyline-related cartoons made by Marvel and Sunbow, the show has remained quite popular even as it has become overshadowed by the various comic book series produced by Marvel and Devil's Due.The episodes are re-mastered in similar fashion to other Rhino sets, which is to say excellently. There's maybe one &quot;new&quot; error in the episodes (involving a card read by Mutt that must have been changed late in production), and two that have been corrected by digital means. The intros and credits, however, are not restored (as seems to be the case for the majority of said clips on the sets so far). The sound has been restored again with a new 5.1 mix, but there's a new wrinkle-the original audio has been included for *all* episodes, and identified as such. (In the past, the 2.0 track has been a crap shoot between a down mix from the 5.1 or the original audio.)As for extras, there are two good interviews with Christy Marx and Wally Burr, and 24 of the classic PSAs (many of which did appear on the G.I. Joe: The Movie DVD, though)-which leaves about a dozen PSAs across Seasons 1 and 2 to be shown on future sets.There are some relatively minor drawbacks, though. Other than the Pyramid of Darkness episodes, the intro is the one from Season 2, as opposed to the correct Season 1 intro. None of the episodes conclude with a PSA before the end credits, which may or may not irk some (even though so many of the PSAs are collected on disc 4). The PSAs themselves are in dicey shape (as to be expected when the 35mm masters for them are nowhere to be found), but two are in particularly poor shape-Torpedo's swimming PSA is sped up (implying that the only surviving version is a poor transfer), and Quick Kick's warning about getting help from adults when building tree houses looks suspiciously like it was cribbed from someone's bootlegged copy from the '80s (which means an official version may be lost forever). Also, the two computer-corrected moments (one involving Destro's Robotopus in Pyramid of Darkness and the other involving a close-up in Cobra's Creatures&quot;) may irk some viewers. However, given the popularity of some of the episodes making their first appearance on home video (such as the Pyramid of Darkness 5-parter), it's impossible to give nothing but the highest recommendation possible to this box set.",5,Another nearly flawless Sunbow box set from Rhino,1075161600,"01 27, 2004",2004,2532,"['Rhino', 'remastering', 'Transformers', 'nearly', 'complete', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'next', 'target', 'wide', 'DVD', 'release', 'been', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'Often', 'considered', 'be', 'best', 'toyline-related', 'cartoons', 'made', 'Marvel', 'Sunbow', 'show', 'remained', 'quite', 'popular', 'even', 'become', 'overshadowed', 'various', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'produced', 'Marvel', 'Devil', 'Due.The', 'episodes', 'are', 're-mastered', 'similar', 'fashion', 'other', 'Rhino', 'sets', 'say', 'excellently', 'maybe', 'one', 'quot', 'new', 'quot', 'error', 'episodes', 'involving', 'card', 'read', 'Mutt', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'late', 'production', 'two', 'have', 'been', 'corrected', 'digital', 'means', 'intros', 'credits', 'however', 'are', 'not', 'restored', 'be', 'case', 'majority', 'said', 'clips', 'sets', 'so', 'far', 'sound', 'been', 'restored', 'again', 'new', '5.1', 'mix', 'new', 'wrinkle-the', 'original', 'audio', 'been', 'included', '*all*', 'episodes', 'identified', 'such', 'past', '2.0', 'track', 'been', 'crap', 'shoot', 'down', 'mix', '5.1', 'original', 'audio', 'extras', 'are', 'two', 'good', 'interviews', 'Christy', 'Marx', 'Wally', 'Burr', '24', 'classic', 'PSAs', 'many', 'did', 'appear', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'Movie', 'DVD', 'though', '-which', 'dozen', 'PSAs', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'be', 'shown', 'future', 'are', 'relatively', 'minor', 'drawbacks', 'though', 'Other', 'Pyramid', 'Darkness', 'episodes', 'intro', 'one', 'Season', '2', 'opposed', 'correct', 'Season', '1', 'intro', 'None', 'episodes', 'conclude', 'PSA', 'end', 'credits', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'irk', 'even', 'so', 'many', 'PSAs', 'are', 'collected', 'disc', '4', 'PSAs', 'are', 'dicey', 'shape', 'be', 'expected', 'when', '35mm', 'masters', 'are', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'two', 'are', 'particularly', 'poor', 'shape-Torpedo', 'swimming', 'PSA', 'sped', 'up', 'implying', 'only', 'surviving', 'version', 'poor', 'transfer', 'Quick', 'Kick', 'warning', 'getting', 'help', 'adults', 'when', 'building', 'tree', 'houses', 'suspiciously', 'was', 'cribbed', 'someone', 'bootlegged', 'copy', ""'80s"", 'official', 'version', 'may', 'be', 'lost', 'forever', 'Also', 'two', 'computer-corrected', 'moments', 'one', 'involving', 'Destro', 'Robotopus', 'Pyramid', 'Darkness', 'other', 'involving', 'close-up', 'Cobra', 'Creatures', 'quot', 'may', 'irk', 'viewers', 'However', 'given', 'popularity', 'episodes', 'making', 'first', 'appearance', 'home', 'video', 'such', 'Pyramid', 'Darkness', '5-parter', 'impossible', 'give', 'nothing', 'highest', 'recommendation', 'possible', 'box', 'set']",N/A
