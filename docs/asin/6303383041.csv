371316,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,6303383041,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[64, 64]","This film is an earnest telling of chapters 25 through 33 of Genesis, and starts when Esau sells his birthright to his twin brother Jacob for a bowl of pottage (red lentil stew), and then gets maneuvered out of his father's blessing by his mother Rebekah. She knows Esau doesn't listen to God's voice, and his two Canaanite wives are a wearisome thing in her life, so Jacob is sent off to her brother (who has daughters), some 400 miles away, where Jacob falls in love with the attractive Rachel...and once there, ""everything he touches, flourishes."" It is a narrative of great faith and perserverance, and the relationship between Jacob and Rachel is touching and sweet.Most of the story follows biblical lines, with a few additions; one of them is inexplicable to me, because it is the only part of the film that could be upsetting to children; it shows Jacob on his journey, fleeing a man he thinks is Esau seeking retribution (it is actually Esau's brother-in-law), when his donkey has a fatal fall from a hillside. It is odd that they would embelish the story with such an unpleasant event, because otherwise the sheep, goats and camels are wonderful, and would be enjoyable viewing for children.The story ends as Jacob, his wives and children (the sons who would become the twelve tribes of Israel), servants and flocks arrive at Shehem. The story is continued in another film of this series, ""Joseph,"" which is superior to this film, and highly recommended.The cast:Matthew Modine is fine as Jacob, Lara Flynn Boyle an excellent, lovely Rachel, and the ever beautiful Irene Papas is a marvelous Rebekah. Sean Bean (Boromir in The Lord of the Rings trilogy) is very good as Esau, and Giancarlo Giannini is Rebekah's devious brother Laban.The score by Marco Frisina adds to the atmosphere, and the cinematography by Ennio Guarneri, though often darkened with a lot of shadows, is nice when using the sub-saharan landscape around Quarzazate, Morocco, where this was filmed; it well depicts how one would imagine the primitive life of ancient nomadic shepherds could be.Total running time is 94 minutes.",4,The Man Who Prevailed,1079740800,"03 20, 2004",2004,2106,"['film', 'earnest', 'telling', 'chapters', '25', '33', 'Genesis', 'when', 'Esau', 'birthright', 'twin', 'brother', 'Jacob', 'bowl', 'pottage', 'red', 'lentil', 'stew', 'then', 'maneuvered', 'father', 'blessing', 'mother', 'Rebekah', 'Esau', ""n't"", 'listen', 'God', 'voice', 'two', 'Canaanite', 'wives', 'are', 'wearisome', 'thing', 'life', 'Jacob', 'sent', 'off', 'brother', 'who', 'daughters', '400', 'miles', 'away', 'where', 'Jacob', 'love', 'attractive', 'Rachel', 'once', 'there', 'everything', 'flourishes', 'narrative', 'great', 'faith', 'perserverance', 'relationship', 'Jacob', 'Rachel', 'touching', 'sweet.Most', 'story', 'biblical', 'lines', 'few', 'additions', 'one', 'inexplicable', 'only', 'part', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'upsetting', 'children', 'Jacob', 'journey', 'fleeing', 'man', 'Esau', 'seeking', 'retribution', 'actually', 'Esau', 'brother-in-law', 'when', 'donkey', 'fatal', 'fall', 'hillside', 'odd', 'would', 'embelish', 'story', 'unpleasant', 'event', 'otherwise', 'sheep', 'goats', 'camels', 'are', 'wonderful', 'would', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'viewing', 'children.The', 'story', 'Jacob', 'wives', 'children', 'sons', 'who', 'would', 'become', 'twelve', 'tribes', 'Israel', 'servants', 'flocks', 'arrive', 'Shehem', 'story', 'continued', 'film', 'series', 'Joseph', 'superior', 'film', 'highly', 'recommended.The', 'cast', 'Matthew', 'Modine', 'fine', 'Jacob', 'Lara', 'Flynn', 'Boyle', 'excellent', 'lovely', 'Rachel', 'ever', 'beautiful', 'Irene', 'Papas', 'marvelous', 'Rebekah', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Boromir', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'very', 'good', 'Esau', 'Giancarlo', 'Giannini', 'Rebekah', 'devious', 'brother', 'Laban.The', 'score', 'Marco', 'Frisina', 'atmosphere', 'cinematography', 'Ennio', 'Guarneri', 'though', 'often', 'darkened', 'lot', 'shadows', 'nice', 'when', 'using', 'sub-saharan', 'landscape', 'Quarzazate', 'Morocco', 'where', 'was', 'filmed', 'well', 'how', 'one', 'would', 'imagine', 'primitive', 'life', 'ancient', 'nomadic', 'shepherds', 'could', 'be.Total', 'running', 'time', '94', 'minutes']",N/A

Jacob is the son of Isaac, but was born just a few seconds too late. He has a twin brother whom he ends up have to betray, along with is father, in order to get the inheritance her mother feels should belong to him.This movie, made for TV, does the story real justice. It tells the love story of Jacob and Leah and shows that true love conquerors all and is willing to work hard. I think that's a lesson missing in many modern relationships. Real love takes work!It's also a story of forgiveness and mercy because Esau, Jacob's brother, eventually forgives him for what he did to him.Modine plays a very good Jacob and I felt he connected with the character.

Set in Morocco, It has very stark desert scenery as a backdrop, pehaps a reflection on the barren period of Jacob's life as a luckless, penniless 'slave' to the greedy and cunning Laban. I did NOT like the actress who played Rachael. I would have expected a shepherdess of that period to be portrayed as a strong resourceful woman, with perhaps an air of Oriental mystique i.e. just her eyes showing at that first meeting at the well. She looks 'wimpy', like, just stepped out of her air-conditioned tent? Considering the casting of the later Lube Productions in this series, they mis-cast in this one! Laban, however, as the villain of the story, is acted well. As the cunning and conniving Uncle he holds the plot together.

371323,A3OXRFCJI67IMN,6303383041,Bold Consumer,"[1, 1]","This DVD is better than other versions that I've seen on Jacob. It isn't an easy story to tell.I've read this story so many times over the years and some of it is so strange to me. This movie portrayed both Rachel and Leah as beautiful, but Leah's pain of being unloved by her husband was heartbreaking. I love the way Jacob gave her respect and tried to be fair to her, because it was not her fault that he was deceived.That's the thing that always bothers me. The deceit in the story. It's so difficult to understand. It does make a little more sense after seeing it. For example, Rebekah's plan to benefit one of her sons over another. She wasn't especially likable. In reading the story I've always had problems with how lovely she was when she became Isaac's wife and how she loved one son at the expense of the other, not lovely at all. The movie doesn't help with that one. Was this God's doing? It isn't any more clear now, but it makes my head hurt. God's ways are mysterious. I will never understand the situation completely, but I will trust Him.I didn't like the scene with the donkey falling down the cliff because it was unnecessary and it wasn't in the scriptures.I loved the way they showed Laban manipulating the situation to his favor, but at the same time, being entirely appropriate for the culture of his time evidently. He was almost likable - almost.The relationship between Jacob and Esau was a little more civil than I had thought. Also, the caravan (profession) was described in detail in the Bible and a little different from this movie. That was an important point for me as I read the story.There is so much about this story that I will never understand. One of those difficult parts is when Jacob wrestled with God and prevailed. This movie did a fine job with it.All-in-all, they have made the story as close as I could have hoped for. I liked this presentation very much.

I enjoyed seeing Matthew Modine and Laura Flynn Boyle as the two main characters in the film. Modine does a great job carrying the film in the lead role. Laura Flynn Boyle, (of TWIN PEAKS television fame), has never been prettier or had a more important role, in my opinion.Sean Bean, (who played Boromir in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING film), plays Esau, the older, rival brother of Jacob. Sean Bean seems a little small and skinny to play Esau, but he makes up for it with his great acting performance.The storytelling is faithful to the Bible scriptures, and the acting, costumes and scenery are very realistic.My only complaints might be that the supernatural scenes are a little too brief or weak on special effects, like Jacob's Ladder, or when Jacob wrestles the angel.TNT, the cable TV channel, is releasing some of these films from the 1990's on DVD, with the subheading ""THE BIBLE COLLECTION."" I can also recommend JOSEPH, but I haven't yet seen the others that are new to DVD.I have waited for years to see these films. They were originally made by a european company called Lube Productions, for made-for-TV movies or miniseries, featuring semi-famous stars from that era. So far, I can say that the ones I have seen are always well-made, nicely acted, with great costumes and scenery, and pretty faithful to scripture, especially when compared with other, more secular productions of the same stories and characters.You might also consider THE BIBLE SERIES BOX SET, which has been out for years, not from TNT but still from the Lube Productions collection. This DVD collection includes ESTHER, JEREMIAH, and SOLOMON.

371326,AB34G6VKP28L,6303383041,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[2, 2]","Considered one of the most authentic and historically accurate films in the Biblical Collection, Jacob is the remarkable story of the young man God promised to make into a powerful nation.Isaac (Joss Ackland) is reaching the end of his life and his wife Rebekah (Irene Papas) believes their younger son Jacob (Matthew Modine) should receive the blessing traditionally given to the firstborn. The more mild-mannered Jacob is her favorite, but her husband favors Esau (Sean Bean), who is a respected hunter in their tribe. Esau's decision to marry outside the faith of their people and to adopt a different lifestyle has displeased God, or so Rebekah believes, and so when Abraham indicates that soon he is to die, she encourages Jacob to use his father's failing eyesight and some trickery to steal his brother's blessing. This drives a deep wedge between the two sons and forces Jacob to flee their encampment, fearing for his life. He sets out with a fortune but is soon set upon by thieves. That night he experiences a vision from God promising that he will be protected and blessed and someday will return to the land of his ancestors. Emboldened by this vow, Jacob continues on to the household of his uncle Laban (Giancarlo Giannini), where he meets Laban's younger and beautiful daughter Rachel (Lara Flynn Boyle).Everything Jacob touches flourishes. The flocks and herds increase under his command, the rains come in abundance, and Laban becomes wealthy. Desiring to keep Jacob there in order to benefit from his God's favor, Laban promises that he may have Rachel as his wife if he gives seven years of service. Jacob agrees, not realizing his uncle has no intention of keeping his word.This film does a very good job in establishing the characters and bringing to life a different, more human side of them. We learn to dislike Laban while admiring Jacob's devotion to his God and his innocent pursuit of the woman he loves. Our compassion for Leah (Juliet Aubrey) is evident while we can also see the moral flaws in Rachel, who tends to be more jealous and conflicted than her older sister. It does focus on the main character but involves the women as well and they become powerful in their own right, as individuals that both draw our fascination and occasionally our frustration. Its approach to the material is respectful and detailed. It has the added benefit of a terrific cast and an immense amount of authenticity when it comes to the lifestyle and traditions of ancient times. It avoids staying indoors too much and grants us a sense of feeling as if we really are living in an encampment. Some of the scenery is absolutely gorgeous and the camera doesn't shy away from wide shots, which allow us to see the barren land that they have made their home. I also liked that took the time to reveal that Jacob favored his younger son by Rachel -- and how that made Leah's children feel. It's a nice way of setting up later events. Only one thing seemed strange to me, and that was the choice of a more soft-spoken actor to play the voice of God. I am accustomed to deep, booming voices in the role but that is just my preference. The scene in which Jacob struggles all night with a messenger of God is very creative and I liked its approach in never showing us just what he was struggling with; it is almost as if at times he is fighting with himself, although there is a presence there.Though a smaller production and one intended for television, Jacob is a good achievement. It is well written and focused on being historically accurate. It is inspiring to see what becomes of Jacob's faith and his determination to make up for his transgressions. Moments of wisdom glimmer in the depths of his conversations with his wives and sons, and there is something powerful in seeing the story brought alive on the screen. Sometimes we can forget how different individuals in scripture entwine into a larger picture. It made me want to reread his story for myself.

Done pretty well, and can be powerful.  You will not regret watching, if you like more accurate Biblical films for your collection.  Brings the Bible to life, in a way.We would like to recommend adding this one too, to anybody's Biblical movie shelf.  But we have one exception which we'll address last herein.It's done fairly well, Biblically accurate for the most part, and conveys the same message as the Scriptures tend to in the Biblical areas it traverses.  Our family enjoyed this one, on many levels.  We'd say ""buy this one!"" as it's pretty good....but....The one exception to us recommending this film, is going to only strike a positive/helpful note with few people (we realize), but nevertheless....the problem we have with this film is that real live human beings with real life families (husbands, and/or wives, and/or children) are being intimate with other people outside of their family all for the sake of ""it's just a job, it's acting.""  We personally don't believe that God will every approve body-close-holding and smooching, as ""just a job so it's okay"" when it comes to non-married people.  You simply won't find that kind of behavior ever supported or condoned in the Bible.  As i said, we realize this won't be a popular stance, in a Media-soaked culture, but nonetheless...it's the flat truth.  So we cannot recommend you actually buy this film.  There ARE films on the market, few though, that have actual actors who are husbands and wives being intimate on screen...or that have husbands and wives pictured who aren't married outside the movie but BARELELY touch in any intimate way (like FireProof, Facing the Giants, Time Changer, Flywheel, and others).  We recommend you just place your own family member in the actor's spot, and see how you'd feel watching your partner or child doing the intimacy with a complete stranger (IN FRONT OF THEIR CHILDREN OR SPOUSE).

The sets were poorly constructed and the acting left something to be desired. I felt that this telling of the story of Jacob was hastily done and the key events held none of the profound quality that they should have. Many of the choices the director made in depicting certain scenes were almost so weak that it made me feel that there was nothing significantly special about Jacob.

It tells the story of the patriarch of the Israelite people.Jacob is a twin. His life begins with a contest with his brother Esau when both struggle to get out of the womb first. The first one out claims the lion's share of the inheritance and power. Esau makes it first.Esau is a hunter and a ""man's man"". Jacob is a thinker. Mom is partial to Jacob while dad prefers the elder. Jacob is adept at tricking his brother and becoming the focus of his anger. When he tricks his brother into selling his birthright for a bowl of beans, Jacob knows he will no longer be safe and leaves to reside among his mother's people.Jacob is a trickster but he always remembers his God and is faithful. Everything he does is blessed and when others try to curse him, they find themselves cursed as well. Jacob falls in love and agrees to work for 7 years to obtain the object of his desire, only to find that he has been tricked into marrying the older sister. He works another 7 for the younger. Before it is over, he has 2 wives, 2 concubines and a host of children. He realizes that the time is coming when he must return home and confront his brother.The drama in this one is not as high as it could have been but it does a good job of catching the basic biblical story.

371344,AYBL30P5NXNZ4,6303383041,"Mr. Stephen Kennedy ""skenn1701a""","[13, 13]","The story of Jacob from the Bible is fairly faithfully retold in no-nonsense terms in this movie directed by Sir Peter Hall.Matthew Modine plays Jacob, Sean Bean is his brother Esau whose inheritance and blessing he steals. He leaves to avoid his brother's wrath and to seek a wife from Laban. He ends up with more than he bargained for - two wifes and 14 years later, he returns home to face his brother.Hall was better known for his theatre work - this makes for strong adherence to the source material, but not the most gripping cinematic experience. Having said that, the acting is fine, especially from the women. Lara Flynn Boyle makes an early appearance here as Rachel, Jacob's true love. The rest of the cast has some fine character actors such as Irene Papas and Joss Ackland as Rebekah and Isaac, and the prolific Giancarlo Giannini as Laban. The class extends to the music, written by Ennio Morricone. The central role of Jacob is thin however, Modine failing to exhibit the charisma, inner strength and spiritual life it must be assumed Jacob had.Sensibly, periods we know little to nothing about are skipped, and the story focuses on the classic elements we know from the Bible.

371353,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,6303383041,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[0, 0]","This 90-minute TNT miniseries is a dramatization of the Biblical story of Jacob in the Book of Genesis, but it only covers his life from the theft of his brother Esau's birthright to their reconciliation years later, with a heavy emphasis on his intervening struggles to marry Rachel despite her crafty father Laban's machinations. Acclaimed theatrical director Sir Peter Hall, founder of the Royal Shakespeare Company, gives the film a style that is more stagey than cinematic, with lots of static shots lacking in dramatic flair. The casting is quite excellent with Matthew Modine, Sean Bean, Lara Flynn Boyle, Irene Papas, Joss Ackland, and Giancarlo Gianni offering richly subtle performances under the sure hand of Hall's direction. Some highlights include Jacob's theft of the birthright, the ""Jacob's Ladder"" dream sequence envisioned with good special effects, Jacob's overnight wrestling match with the angel who renames him Israel, Jacob's battle of wits with Laban, and the final reconciliation between the brothers. The battle of wits with Laban is probably the most entertaining stretch of the film. The editing in several of these sequences is surprisingly sharp, helping to compensate for the inherent dullness of this story, which is among the least memorable of many beautiful passages in the Book of Genesis. This is probably the best possible film of this material, but the material itself is weak, as the drama of Jacob's story is so internally focused that it is not easy to visualize in an involving way. Compared to the other very rich films produced by the same artists in the TNT Bible Collection and Trimark Bible Series, most of which are three hours long, this miniseries is also the weakest. It offers a relatively inconsequential story in only 90 minutes of film, an unusually weak Marco Frisina musical score, and acting that fails to move the viewer despite being technically sound. Compared to Matthew Modine, Martin Landau fares much better as an older Jacob in ""Joseph,"" the Emmy-winning miniseries that picks up this story at Shechem and relates the family conflicts of Jacob's wives and sons. Indeed, ""Joseph"" remains the best cinematic version of the shepherd stories that fill most of Genesis, but even the first TNT film ""Abraham"" (1994) with Richard Harris beats this one. Although it features the same historical authenticity and excellent costumes/locations as these other films, ""Jacob"" is just not in the same class as ""Moses"" with Ben Kingsley and ""David"" with Nathaniel Parker,"" which are rousing little epics even if they fall short of ""Joseph."" Nevertheless, ""Jacob"" is still lightyears better than the more recent Biblical epics released by these Italian production companies on the American DVD market -- such as ""Paul the Apostle with Johannes Brandrup -- which are entirely filled with badly dubbed European actors and cheaper production values. At least ""Jacob"" is a true collaboration between English and non-English speaking filmmakers, with good actors portraying the roles and a sure dramatic hand behind the camera. In summary, enjoy ""Jacob"" if you want to see a well-staged Biblical tale that is rarely filmed, but remember that there are better Biblical films in this series to enjoy afterwards.",5,Solid if dull dramatization of Biblical story,1383696000,"11 6, 2013",2013,3256,"['90-minute', 'TNT', 'miniseries', 'dramatization', 'Biblical', 'story', 'Jacob', 'Book', 'Genesis', 'only', 'life', 'theft', 'brother', 'Esau', 'birthright', 'reconciliation', 'years', 'later', 'heavy', 'emphasis', 'intervening', 'marry', 'Rachel', 'crafty', 'father', 'Laban', 'machinations', 'Acclaimed', 'theatrical', 'director', 'Sir', 'Peter', 'Hall', 'founder', 'Royal', 'Shakespeare', 'Company', 'film', 'style', 'more', 'stagey', 'cinematic', 'lots', 'static', 'shots', 'lacking', 'dramatic', 'flair', 'casting', 'quite', 'excellent', 'Matthew', 'Modine', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Lara', 'Flynn', 'Boyle', 'Irene', 'Papas', 'Joss', 'Ackland', 'Giancarlo', 'Gianni', 'offering', 'richly', 'subtle', 'performances', 'sure', 'hand', 'Hall', 'direction', 'highlights', 'include', 'Jacob', 'theft', 'birthright', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'dream', 'sequence', 'envisioned', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'Jacob', 'overnight', 'wrestling', 'match', 'angel', 'who', 'Israel', 'Jacob', 'battle', 'wits', 'Laban', 'final', 'reconciliation', 'brothers', 'battle', 'wits', 'Laban', 'probably', 'most', 'entertaining', 'stretch', 'film', 'editing', 'several', 'sequences', 'surprisingly', 'sharp', 'helping', 'compensate', 'inherent', 'dullness', 'story', 'least', 'memorable', 'many', 'beautiful', 'passages', 'Book', 'Genesis', 'probably', 'best', 'possible', 'film', 'material', 'material', 'weak', 'drama', 'Jacob', 'story', 'so', 'internally', 'focused', 'not', 'easy', 'visualize', 'involving', 'way', 'Compared', 'other', 'very', 'rich', 'films', 'produced', 'same', 'artists', 'TNT', 'Bible', 'Collection', 'Trimark', 'Bible', 'Series', 'most', 'are', 'three', 'hours', 'long', 'miniseries', 'also', 'weakest', 'relatively', 'inconsequential', 'story', 'only', '90', 'minutes', 'film', 'unusually', 'weak', 'Marco', 'Frisina', 'musical', 'score', 'acting', 'move', 'viewer', 'being', 'technically', 'sound', 'Compared', 'Matthew', 'Modine', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'much', 'better', 'older', 'Jacob', 'Joseph', 'Emmy-winning', 'miniseries', 'up', 'story', 'Shechem', 'family', 'conflicts', 'Jacob', 'wives', 'sons', 'Indeed', 'Joseph', 'best', 'cinematic', 'version', 'shepherd', 'stories', 'fill', 'most', 'Genesis', 'even', 'first', 'TNT', 'film', 'Abraham', '1994', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'one', 'same', 'historical', 'authenticity', 'excellent', 'costumes/locations', 'other', 'films', 'Jacob', 'just', 'not', 'same', 'class', 'Moses', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'David', 'Nathaniel', 'Parker', 'are', 'rousing', 'little', 'epics', 'even', 'fall', 'short', 'Joseph', 'Nevertheless', 'Jacob', 'still', 'better', 'more', 'recent', 'Biblical', 'epics', 'released', 'Italian', 'production', 'companies', 'American', 'DVD', 'market', 'such', 'Paul', 'Apostle', 'Johannes', 'Brandrup', 'are', 'entirely', 'filled', 'badly', 'dubbed', 'European', 'actors', 'cheaper', 'production', 'values', 'least', 'Jacob', 'true', 'collaboration', 'English', 'non-English', 'speaking', 'filmmakers', 'good', 'actors', 'portraying', 'roles', 'sure', 'dramatic', 'hand', 'camera', 'summary', 'enjoy', 'Jacob', 'want', 'see', 'well-staged', 'Biblical', 'tale', 'rarely', 'filmed', 'remember', 'are', 'better', 'Biblical', 'films', 'series', 'enjoy', 'afterwards']",N/A
371354,A3AW8XP45YVIIZ,6303383041,Utah Blaine,"[7, 7]","This is one of a series of made for TV movies that were produced in the 1990s to recount various Biblical Old Testament tales.  Don't let the `made for TV' aspect turn you off this, this movie (and series) is well done.  This movie tells the Genesis story of the brothers Jacob and Esau.  Esau is the older brother, but Jacob tricks him out of his dying father's blessing.  At the encouragement of his mother, Jacob flees to his uncle's family and begins life anew there, starting from nothing.  His hard work and faith in God are ultimately (after 14 years of servitude to his uncle) rewarded by God and he eventually has twelve sons of his own and is the head of a great family.  The acting is superb, the cinematography great, and the production quality high.  In fact, I would say that in many ways films of this series are superior to the blockbuster epics of the 50s and 60s such as Ben Hur.  In particular, I think that the production team did a good job of making an entertaining story, but at the same time preserving the Biblical message behind the story.  The message is more important than the film, not really the case in Ben Hur like epics with casts of thousands.  In this case, the message is that God is always with you and has a plan for you, even though your life may have many ups and downs.  Another thing that I liked about this film (and the series in general) is that the production team kept the story to it's Biblical, non-denominational minimum.  There was little or no effort (at least that I could discern) at putting a denominational (either Christian or Jewish) spin.
