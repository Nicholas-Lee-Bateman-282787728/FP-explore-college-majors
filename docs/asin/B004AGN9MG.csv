And when you think about how it is shot, being made up of single movements of these clay models.  Well, that is a painstaking job, and I am so glad that the people who do this show are willing to work that hard for our amusement.",5,Great little show,1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,348,"['Young', 'old', 'who', 'likes', 'cartoons', 'will', 'enjoy', 'series', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'show', 'when', 'think', 'how', 'shot', 'being', 'made', 'single', 'movements', 'clay', 'models', 'Well', 'painstaking', 'job', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'show', 'are', 'willing', 'work', 'hard', 'amusement']",Shaun the Sheep: Spring Shena-a-anigans

I commented that it looked like Shaun the Sheep, a cartoon character we have in the UK. She had not heard of him so I got her the video and she was enthralled by Shaun as were her grandchildren.

1393390,A26K25KKMYY9TG,B004AGN9MG,Lindsey,"[41, 41]","We love Shaun the Sheep and this collection of episodes isn't disappointing in the least!  The seven episodes on this DVD are:-  ""Spring Lamb"" - It's bath time for a reluctant Timmy. In trying to escape, Timmy gets a spring attached to his tail. It's up to the flock to catch the bouncing baby sheep and return him to the tub before he destroys the farm.-  ""Supersize Timmy"" - Timmy accidentally eats a tomato grown with ""Miracle-Grow"" fertilizer and expands to become the King Kong of sheep. Shaun must keep the giant toddler out of sight while trying to figure out how to return him to normal size.- ""Bagpipe Buddy"" - The sheep discover a set of bagpipes on the rubbish dump which they immediately misidentify as a sick emu. They set about trying to nurse it back to health before releasing it back into the wild.- ""Cheetah Cheater"" - A wildlife film inspires Pidsley the cat to play a prank on the flock by disguising himself as a leopard. Shaun is convinced there is a huge beast on the loose and concocts a plan to catch it.- ""Lock Out"" - While preparing for bed, the Farmer manages to lock himself out of the house and is stuck outside in his pajamas. He decides to spend the night in the barn but his incessant snoring drives the flock mad. Shaun heads up an operation to return him to his bed without waking him up.- ""Draw the Line"" - The flock hijack a road line-painting machine and cause chaos while creating giant works of art in the field.- ""Ewe've Been Framed"" - When Shaun accidentally breaks the farmer's glasses, he and Bitzer have their work cut out trying to prevent their short-sighted master from having mishaps around the farm. Things get a little hair-raising for the flock before Shaun manages to replace the smashed up spectacles.Bonus features include a game and a bonus Timmy Time episode (a new show centered around Timmy, the baby sheep).  Definitely recommended!",5,Another great DVD to add to your collection!,1300492800,"03 19, 2011",2011,1892,"['love', 'Sheep', 'collection', 'episodes', ""n't"", 'disappointing', 'least', 'seven', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'are', 'Spring', 'Lamb', 'bath', 'time', 'reluctant', 'Timmy', 'trying', 'escape', 'Timmy', 'spring', 'attached', 'tail', 'up', 'flock', 'catch', 'bouncing', 'baby', 'sheep', 'return', 'tub', 'farm.-', 'Supersize', 'Timmy', 'Timmy', 'accidentally', 'tomato', 'grown', 'Miracle-Grow', 'fertilizer', 'become', 'King', 'Kong', 'sheep', 'Shaun', 'must', 'keep', 'giant', 'toddler', 'sight', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'return', 'normal', 'size.-', 'Bagpipe', 'Buddy', 'sheep', 'discover', 'set', 'bagpipes', 'rubbish', 'dump', 'immediately', 'misidentify', 'sick', 'emu', 'set', 'trying', 'nurse', 'back', 'health', 'releasing', 'back', 'wild.-', 'Cheetah', 'Cheater', 'wildlife', 'film', 'inspires', 'Pidsley', 'cat', 'play', 'prank', 'flock', 'disguising', 'leopard', 'Shaun', 'convinced', 'huge', 'beast', 'loose', 'plan', 'catch', 'it.-', 'Lock', 'Out', 'preparing', 'bed', 'Farmer', 'lock', 'house', 'stuck', 'pajamas', 'spend', 'night', 'barn', 'incessant', 'snoring', 'flock', 'mad', 'Shaun', 'up', 'operation', 'return', 'bed', 'waking', 'up.-', 'Draw', 'Line', 'flock', 'hijack', 'road', 'line-painting', 'machine', 'cause', 'chaos', 'creating', 'giant', 'works', 'art', 'field.-', 'Ewe', ""'ve"", 'Been', 'Framed', 'When', 'Shaun', 'accidentally', 'farmer', 'glasses', 'Bitzer', 'have', 'work', 'cut', 'out', 'trying', 'prevent', 'short-sighted', 'master', 'having', 'mishaps', 'farm', 'Things', 'get', 'little', 'hair-raising', 'flock', 'Shaun', 'replace', 'smashed', 'up', 'spectacles.Bonus', 'features', 'include', 'game', 'bonus', 'Timmy', 'Time', 'episode', 'new', 'show', 'centered', 'Timmy', 'baby', 'sheep', 'Definitely', 'recommended']",Shaun the Sheep: Spring Shena-a-anigans
