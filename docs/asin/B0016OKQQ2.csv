1154620,AWI9GDTFUZZ9K,B0016OKQQ2,DAVID G. MCHALE IV,"[4, 4]","1987's POOR LITTLE RICH GIRL: THE BARBRA HUTTON STORY was quite an event when it aired 22 years ago. This is a stellar mini-series and am so glad it's been given a DVD release. The true story is often sad and tragic despite the fact Miss Hutton was loaded, heir to the Woolworth fortune. She lost her mother early on to suicide, her father didn't want her, and spent her life longing and looking for genuine love. This was often a difficult task for her due to her early childhood imprinting, as well as the often impossible task to ever know if people like you for you - or your bank balance. She did have a few real friends and her loyal gay cousin Jimmy, but even those through time, drugs, and for multible psychological reasons deterorated or she destroyed. Barbara even had a son who sadly was sometimes neglected by her repeating the same emotional abandoment she herself was so scared by. Despite all the drama you feel deeply for her and realize people often genuinely can't teach you what they themselves don't know. To break family cycles of belief and behavior is much easier said than done - this story being a prime example.  FARRAH FAWCETT is simply astounding as the complex tortured Miss Hutton. Her performance is multi-faceted and she truely dazzles in what I believe is one of her best dramatic pieces. FARRAH exhibits the full spectrum of the emotion palette brilliantly and you find astounding facial subtlties that are so real throughout her portrayal - the pain, grief, and sometimes joy all seep from the haunted well that resides in Barbra. I find MISS FAWCETT to be an underated creative artist, and now that her soul has recently left us - maybe her work will be re-evalulated and seen for what it is. Along with FARRAH'S fine craft it's great to see her looking fabulous in all this vintage garb she adorns. They spent a fortune on this mini-series and it shows in its international locations, Harry Winston jewels, and period fashions that are to die for. The other actors are also quite good, and its great to experience a class act production from beginning to end.

1154629,A228JH8V9Y700G,B0016OKQQ2,MortensOrchid,"[0, 0]","I just watched this not too long ago through Netflix, and I was impressed with it for a variety of reasons.  Firstly, this was a made for television movie / miniseries in the 1980s.  In those days a made for TV movie / miniseries (though it probably only aired for a few days rather than weeks that a miniseries would) used to rival feature films and just as many established Hollywood stars would vie for parts in them as they would a movie.  Second, it is a biography / true story rather than something that was given a ""soap opera treatment"", because the woman's life was a soap opera without even trying.  Third, this was Farrah Faucet in her prime long before she became a joke, and she did a decent job at this, rather than her dizzy blonde routines that made her so famous.Barbara Hutton was the girl dubbed the ""poor little rich girl"" or the ""million dollar baby"", as the granddaughter of Woolworth's five and dime founder and the daughter of broker Hutton (of E.F. Hutton).  Adjusted for inflation today, she would have been a billionaire.  Her life, however, was anything but happy.  Her mother committed suicide when Barbara was a child over her family's disappointment over her husband's infidelity, and her father Hutton dumped her on nannies, servants and boarding schools to raise.  She was so lonely she gave her toys and dolls away to other children to play with to be her friends, and she seemed to adapt to that same behavior for the rest of her life.  While she had everything you could ever want or need and lead a globetrotting lifestyle that others only dream about, she was far from happy.  If Barbara was alive today, she would say the only thing she ever wanted was to be loved - either from her family or from one of the seven husbands she would eventually marry.  Instead she was taken advantage of, became anorexic, and died nearly broke.There are many lessons to be learned from this woman's life story.  The obvious is that money cannot buy happiness.  Others may include the fact that we need trusted friends and family to keep us from being lonely and keep us from making bad choices.  When we are blessed with so much, we have to find a way to give back or perhaps use what we have to make us more community minded because it's not all about me.  And, perhaps the most important, is that the world is full of lonely people.",4,Million dollar Farrah,1379721600,"09 21, 2013",2013,2357,"['just', 'watched', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'ago', 'Netflix', 'was', 'impressed', 'variety', 'reasons', 'Firstly', 'was', 'made', 'television', 'movie', '/', 'miniseries', '1980s', 'days', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', '/', 'miniseries', 'probably', 'only', 'aired', 'few', 'days', 'rather', 'weeks', 'miniseries', 'would', 'used', 'rival', 'feature', 'films', 'just', 'many', 'established', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'would', 'vie', 'parts', 'would', 'movie', 'Second', 'biography', '/', 'true', 'story', 'rather', 'something', 'was', 'given', 'soap', 'opera', 'treatment', 'woman', 'life', 'was', 'soap', 'opera', 'even', 'trying', 'Third', 'was', 'Farrah', 'Faucet', 'prime', 'long', 'became', 'joke', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'rather', 'dizzy', 'blonde', 'routines', 'made', 'so', 'famous.Barbara', 'Hutton', 'was', 'girl', 'dubbed', 'poor', 'little', 'rich', 'girl', 'million', 'dollar', 'baby', 'granddaughter', 'Woolworth', 'five', 'dime', 'founder', 'daughter', 'broker', 'Hutton', 'E.F.', 'Hutton', 'Adjusted', 'inflation', 'today', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'billionaire', 'Her', 'life', 'however', 'was', 'anything', 'happy', 'mother', 'committed', 'suicide', 'when', 'Barbara', 'was', 'child', 'family', 'disappointment', 'husband', 'infidelity', 'father', 'Hutton', 'dumped', 'nannies', 'servants', 'boarding', 'schools', 'raise', 'was', 'so', 'lonely', 'gave', 'toys', 'away', 'other', 'children', 'play', 'be', 'friends', 'seemed', 'adapt', 'same', 'behavior', 'rest', 'life', 'had', 'everything', 'could', 'ever', 'want', 'need', 'lead', 'globetrotting', 'lifestyle', 'others', 'only', 'dream', 'was', 'far', 'happy', 'Barbara', 'was', 'alive', 'today', 'would', 'say', 'only', 'thing', 'ever', 'wanted', 'was', 'be', 'loved', 'family', 'one', 'seven', 'husbands', 'would', 'eventually', 'marry', 'Instead', 'was', 'taken', 'advantage', 'became', 'anorexic', 'died', 'nearly', 'broke.There', 'are', 'many', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'woman', 'life', 'story', 'obvious', 'money', 'can', 'not', 'buy', 'happiness', 'Others', 'may', 'include', 'fact', 'need', 'trusted', 'friends', 'family', 'keep', 'being', 'lonely', 'keep', 'making', 'bad', 'choices', 'When', 'are', 'blessed', 'so', 'much', 'have', 'find', 'way', 'give', 'back', 'perhaps', 'use', 'what', 'have', 'make', 'more', 'community', 'minded', 'not', 'perhaps', 'most', 'important', 'world', 'full', 'lonely', 'people']",N/A

Fantastic locations, an excellent international cast support Farrah Fawcett in the role of a lifetime.If anyone ever wondered if Farrah could act, this project proved that she is FANTASTIC.  The story covers 60 years , and Farrah brings life to the adult Barbara Hutton , in perfection.As you move through the story, you care about and like Hutton, though she made horrid decisions which in the end destroyed her.Those who enjoy costume design will find nirvana in this production- perfect copies of designer goods for the period.The show stopper here may well be the jewelry, primarily provided by Harry Winston. Most was real,and some were copies but all were breathtaking.( After the show ran, Farrah sold copies of the Winston items on HSN, which are truly collectable and worth a fortune now).I urge you to try this 2 DVD set - it a great story,and well produced in every way.  Some of the scenes are violent, which may be a concern to some.  Rest assured, they exist in the plot to move the story along and are done with care.The (sadly) few extras consist of the ad's promoting each two hour block of the story.Odd box art is very stark, and does NOT suggest the lush production inside!And I forgot to mention the music-- perfection again!I will not spoil it for you, but the last shot, with a voice over is chilling.You will love this!UPDATE AUG 2009:Watched this again, with friends who had not seen this.  What a nice tribute to Farrah - I am quite sure she would be happy to know that people continue to enjoy her work, particularly in her more dramatic roles.  This mini-series is is rich, and so well produced.Sadly, one (well, me at least) can't overlook the irony of of the core story - Barbara Hutton made choices in her life, and particularly in relation to men, that did not turn out well.Farrah plays Hutton so well, so knowingly, it is truly touching.

1154631,A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS,B0016OKQQ2,"Rama Rao ""Rama""","[1, 1]","This is a moving story about the tragic life of Woolworth heiress Barbara Hutton. Farah Fawcett offers a stunning performance as the world's richest woman who destroys herself, physically and emotionally. Ms. Hutton faces several tragedies in her life, starting with a very unhappy childhood, growing up in a dysfunctional family, her mother's suicide, longing for a normal childhood, such as playing with friends, going to school, etc. She goes through seven unhealthy marriages and suffers emotionally. She surrounds herself with greedy and philandering men who have no regards for her feelings. She sees a world which is too eager to judge that she is too wealthy and therefore she is deserves to be unhappy. This human nature is scary, which refuses to see Ms. Hutton as a human being prone to commit judgmental errors. No doubt she does too many errors in her life, but she was also a very spiritual and caring person. This is illustrated in the movie splendidly. She developed keen interest in Buddhism and her marriage to Porfirio Rubirosa in 1953 was performed in this tradition. She had strong interest in wearing Indian saris; she wore them regularly in her life and had a big collection of them. She was a great philanthropist. She shares her wealth with many organizations dedicated to worthy causes and offers financial help to many people she comes across in here life. She donated Winfield House in London to the United States government to be used as the residence of its ambassador to the United Kingdom. When she is married to Cary Grant, she donates her expensive jewelry to her maid to wear during the maid's marriage. She offers financial help to many of her employees at the house.Her personal life was full of misery; her first two husbands used her great wealth to their advantage, especially the extremely abusive Count Kurt von Haugwitz-Reventlow with whom she had her only child, a son named Lance. Reventlow was verbally and physical abusive. Her marriage to Cary Grant appears to be happy, but doesn't last long. It turns out Grant is the only husband who cares her only son and gives some sanity in her life. Like everything she did in her life, she loose focus in her family life and her priorities gets too diffuse. Later in her life she suffers from drug abuse that leads to anorexia which would harm her for the rest of her life. The 1972 death of her son in an aircraft crash sends her into a state of deep depression. Her fortune dwindles rapidly due to her extreme generosity and she begins to liquidate her assets in order to raise funds to pay her bills. She spent her final years at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel, Beverly Hills, California, and at the time of her death, she was almost penniless.This movie is brilliantly directed and very well written. Farah Fawcett offers a brilliant performance in the title role.
