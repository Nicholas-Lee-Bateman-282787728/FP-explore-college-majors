I'm hoping that the show will be released on DVD. The episode that Lindsay won an Emmy for Best Actress in a Dramatic Series was the 2nd or 3rd time she played a dual role as Jamie and as Lisa. In that episode, both women suffered identity crises. Jamie was institutionalized and drugged, and they tried to ""brainwash"" her into thinking she was her ""twin"" (by plastic surgery.) Lisa, on the other hand, had convinced herself that she truly WAS Jamie, and longed for Jamie's sense of family she had with relatives. That two-part episode is my favorite of all. When Oscar Goldman tests Jamie's hearing from hundreds of feet away, she responds, ""Oscar, I can hear you! I can hear you!"" my heart always skipped a beat, because Oscar KNOWS it's Jamie. I DO hope they release at least THAT episode, because it is by far the best one.",4,Lindsay Wagner won an Emmy,1150502400,"06 17, 2006",2006,941,"['did', ""n't"", 'win', 'Emmy', 'award', 'third', 'season', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'great', 'deal', 'time', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'episode', 'Lindsay', 'won', 'Emmy', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Dramatic', 'Series', 'was', '2nd', '3rd', 'time', 'played', 'dual', 'role', 'Jamie', 'Lisa', 'episode', 'women', 'suffered', 'identity', 'crises', 'Jamie', 'was', 'institutionalized', 'drugged', 'tried', 'brainwash', 'thinking', 'was', 'twin', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'Lisa', 'other', 'hand', 'had', 'convinced', 'truly', 'WAS', 'Jamie', 'longed', 'Jamie', 'sense', 'family', 'had', 'relatives', 'two-part', 'episode', 'favorite', 'When', 'Oscar', 'Goldman', 'Jamie', 'hearing', 'hundreds', 'feet', 'away', 'Oscar', 'can', 'hear', 'can', 'hear', 'heart', 'always', 'skipped', 'beat', 'Oscar', 'KNOWS', 'Jamie', 'DO', 'hope', 'release', 'least', 'THAT', 'episode', 'far', 'best', 'one']",The Bionic Woman: Volume 1

Season 1 is available as of this date in both countries, and I believe I saw an advert for Australia as well.  Other 3-episode discs were officially released prior to the Season 1 set in the UK.  They are, of course, Region 2/PAL discs.  SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN has also been released similarly.I have seen these discs, and the quality is excellent, by the way.Why the series is being held up in the States is beyond me, especially with the plethora of choices we have out already.I respectfully request that posters do their research, or at least make sure they know what they're talking about, before posting erroneous information for public consumption.",4,This release IS NOT A BOOTLEG!,1148860800,"05 29, 2006",2006,786,"['Contrary', 'previous', 'posting', 'THE', 'BIONIC', 'WOMAN', 'been', 'legally', 'officially', 'released', 'UK', 'France', 'Universal', 'Season', '1', 'available', 'date', 'countries', 'believe', 'saw', 'advert', 'Australia', 'as', 'well', 'Other', '3-episode', 'discs', 'were', 'officially', 'released', 'prior', 'Season', '1', 'set', 'UK', 'are', 'course', 'Region', '2/PAL', 'discs', 'SIX', 'MILLION', 'DOLLAR', 'MAN', 'also', 'been', 'released', 'similarly.I', 'have', 'seen', 'discs', 'quality', 'excellent', 'way.Why', 'series', 'being', 'held', 'up', 'States', 'especially', 'plethora', 'choices', 'have', 'out', 'already.I', 'respectfully', 'request', 'posters', 'do', 'research', 'least', 'make', 'sure', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'talking', 'posting', 'erroneous', 'information', 'public', 'consumption']",The Bionic Woman: Volume 1
