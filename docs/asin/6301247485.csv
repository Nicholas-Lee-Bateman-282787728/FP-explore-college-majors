248004,A31UE0LJBKCHUA,6301247485,A Customer,"[5, 12]","I was incredibly disappointed with this version of The Great Gatsby.  My main qualm was that in the book, Nick Carraway was the narrator.  However they did not see reason to use a narrator with this version.  Unfortunately, we have then lost insight into Nick's character and some of the best parts of the book.  Instead of giving it a brilliant ending where Nick is supposed to say &quot;So we beat on, boats against the current, borne ceaselessly into the past,&quot; we have a scene of flappers and &quot;Ain't We Got Fun&quot; as background music.  Exactly what were they trying to convey through that?  I feel they put too much emphasis and time into the parties where nothing of interest save for some dancing and pretty dresses happened.  There were also scenes which focused solely on Gatsby's possessions.  While it is important to know that he owns a lot of stuff and owns it all for Daisy, for God's sake put some TASTE into it!  Watching Mia Farrow throw a dozen multi-coloured shirts into the air and a set of brushes next to a half-eaten sandwhich with flies all over it is not my idea of good cinematography.  The acting was terrible in this, as well.  The one saving grace being perhaps Nick.  Mia Farrow simply portrayed Daisy as a dumb blonde but there's SO MUCH more to her we never learn.  Robert Redford's Gatsby, well nothing could really be said about it.  It wasn't Gatsby, it was Robert Redford PLAYING Gatsby.  Jordan Baker was absolutely detestable, and Tom Buchanan just irritated me to no end.

248005,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6301247485,Acute Observer,"[1, 1]","The Great Gatsby, 1974 filmThe movie begins with pleasure boats sailing on water. A men speaks about the times. He arrives at a mansion. Nick Caraway is a bond salesman on Wall Street. We see the lives of the idle rich. Tom Buchanan talks about ""scientific proof"" for the biases of that era. Daisy sees a nightingale on the lawn. Nick's neighbor is Jay Gatsby. We see a large tent set up there for an outdoor party. Nick hears the music there. Many people came to these parties. Tom takes Nick to a garage owned by Mr. Wilson; we see Mrs. Wilson. [This is a formula for trouble.] Tom and Myrtle make a scene! Nick goes to a Gatsby party. The guests gossip about Gatsby, little is known about him. Nick is invited to meet Gatsby in private. [Why?] A group of musicians arrive to play. Gatsby talks about himself, then about a business deal. Wolfschein fixed the 1919 World Series. Nick invites Daisy to a meeting.Gatsby meets Daisy at Nick's place. They go to Gatsby's mansion. [What business is he in?] Daisy is impressed by his wardrobe. Jay has a scrapbook filled with pictures of Daisy. [Isn't that weird?] We learn of their past friendship before the war. Tom gave Daisy an expensive string of pearls. [Does she seem in her right mind?] ""Why didn't you wait for me?"" ""Rich girls don't marry poor boys."" There is another party. Couples dance the Charleston. Some fall into a pool. A lot of the newly rich people are bootleggers, says Tom. ""You can't repeat the past"" says Nick. Tom wants to learn about Gatsby. Daisy and Gatsby dance in the dim light. ""I love you, Jay."" A reporter from the ""New York Journal"" questions Nick about Gatsby, he knows nothing. Gatsby has fired all the servants. ""Why don't we go to town?"" says Tom. Mr. Wilson wants to go West  with his wife, he isn't well. [Tuberculosis?]The cars arrive at a hotel. Tom questions Jay about Oxford. Jay tells Tom Daisy never loved him! Tom loves Daisy tho. Tom calls Jay a common swindler, ""his drugstores sell alcohol over the counter"". [Do patent medicines evade Prohibition?] Wilson talks to Myrtle, they argue. They learn of an accident; a big yellow car killed Myrtle! ""Which church should I call, George?"" Jay talks about the distant past. Was Daisy driving? What should they do? Mr. Wilson visits Tom. Jay swims in his pool. Mr. Wilson enters Jay's house; he has a big revolver. He fires it more than once. The police investigate the deaths. Gatsby's father arrives. Nick refuses to shake Tom's hand. The movie ends with the satiric song ""Ain't We Got Fun"".I never read the novel. If this an accurate portrayal I will avoid it. This movie runs on too long. Why do some praise this novel? Maybe for the details that were omitted from this movie. Why would Gatsby hold his parties? It allows people to meet and carry on business with more privacy than in other public places. Was Gatsby's friendship with Nick an attempt to infiltrate Wall Street to maybe swindle investors with over-valued stocks and bonds. Many people were swindled out of millions when they purchased over-valued bonds and stocks in the 1920s. Stockbrokers sold risky investments, some from foreign countries. The New Deal reforms put an end to many of these scams. But in the 1990s many of these laws were repealed or weakened to allow more scams. Ever hear of ""Glass-Steagal""? You should! It also shows the hypocrisy and crookedness of the ruling class (the rich and famous).

248009,AGEIT17HENDIS,6301247485,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 3]","THIS REVIEW WAS WRITTEN AS A REVIEW FOR THE BOOK BY F. SCOTT FITZGERALD. MOST OF THE MAIN POINTS HERE ALSO RELATE TO THE MOVIE. HOWEVER, IF YOU HAVE A CHOICE READ THE BOOK. ROBERT REDFORD AND MIA FARROW ACT TOO WOODENLY TO CONVEY THE REAL PATHOS OF JAY GATSBY'S STRUGGLE AND ITS CAUTIONARY TALE- THE VERY RICH ARE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM US.One would have to be rather pedantic not recognize that F. Scott Fitzgerald was an important novelistic voice of the Jazz Age in post World War I America. Certainly not the only voice of that age but the voice which best exemplifies the tensions between the mores of `old wealth' and the emerging sources of `new wealth' that were produced by the huge amount of money available, mainly through government contracts  as result of the war or riches gained through the illegal liquor trade. That is the sociological underpinning that drives Fitzgerald's work. This is no better example of those strivings than the Great Gatsby.  If nothing else it is a dramatic enactment of the strivings of the new money to `make it' in the world of high society, one way or another. And what better way to do that than in the age old tradition of buying one's way into that society through marriage. This is the modern American version of that story.And the story itself? One Jay Gatsby, the former Jimmy Ganz, freshly reinventing himself after indeterminate service in the American military in World War I  and loaded with cash from questionable financial resources, attempts to win, or rather re-win the affections of one Daisy Buchanan his vision of the perfect life companion and exemplar of the `old money' crowd that he wishes to crash. One little complication, however, gets in the way. She has found herself married to a brutish but wealthy member of that `old money' crowd. Gatsby's fumbling but lavish attempts to lure her away from the high society of Long Island, then the summer watering hole of the `old money', forms the core of the story. Gatsby's trial and tribulations on the way as narrated by Nick Carroway (and Gatsby's somewhat unwitting accomplice in the matter) keeps the story line going until the final deadly ending. The morale- the very rich are indeed very different from you or I. Moreover, someone else will always have to pick up the messes they have made for themselves. They merely move on.  This may serve as a cautionary tale for that time and possibly today. Certainly nobody has chronicled the end of the age of American innocence signaled by the Jazz Age better than Fitzgerald.A word on literary merits. According to the inevitable changes in literary fashion as well as literary politics Fitzgerald, for long a leading figure in the canon of American literature has been somewhat eclipsed by other more post-modernist trends. While I firmly believe that the Western canon is in dire need of expansion to include `third world', woman and minority voices Fitzgerald's literary merits stand on their own. His tightly- crafted story line, his sense of language and the flat-out fact that that he knew the subject matter that formed the basis of his expositions merit renewed consideration by today's reader. Simply put, if you want to understand part of what was going on in America in the 1920's before the Great Crash of 1929 then you simply have to read the man. If nothing else read the last few pages of Gatsby. If there is a better literary expression of the promise of America as seem by the early Dutch settlers of New York  as the last best hope of civilization and the failure of that promise at the hands of the `robber barons' and their descendents I have not read it.",3,A VOICE FROM THE JAZZ AGE,1176768000,"04 17, 2007",2007,3638,"['THIS', 'REVIEW', 'WAS', 'WRITTEN', 'A', 'REVIEW', 'THE', 'BOOK', 'BY', 'F.', 'SCOTT', 'FITZGERALD', 'MOST', 'THE', 'MAIN', 'POINTS', 'HERE', 'ALSO', 'RELATE', 'TO', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'HOWEVER', 'IF', 'YOU', 'HAVE', 'A', 'CHOICE', 'READ', 'THE', 'BOOK', 'ROBERT', 'REDFORD', 'AND', 'MIA', 'FARROW', 'ACT', 'TOO', 'WOODENLY', 'TO', 'CONVEY', 'THE', 'REAL', 'PATHOS', 'OF', 'JAY', 'GATSBY', 'STRUGGLE', 'ITS', 'CAUTIONARY', 'TALE-', 'THE', 'VERY', 'RICH', 'ARE', 'QUITE', 'DIFFERENT', 'FROM', 'US.One', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'rather', 'pedantic', 'not', 'recognize', 'F.', 'Scott', 'Fitzgerald', 'was', 'important', 'novelistic', 'voice', 'Jazz', 'Age', 'post', 'World', 'War', 'America', 'Certainly', 'not', 'only', 'voice', 'age', 'voice', 'best', 'tensions', 'mores', 'old', 'wealth', 'emerging', 'sources', 'new', 'wealth', 'were', 'produced', 'huge', 'amount', 'money', 'available', 'mainly', 'government', 'contracts', 'result', 'war', 'riches', 'gained', 'illegal', 'liquor', 'trade', 'sociological', 'underpinning', 'Fitzgerald', 'work', 'better', 'example', 'strivings', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'nothing', 'else', 'dramatic', 'enactment', 'strivings', 'new', 'money', 'make', 'world', 'high', 'society', 'one', 'way', 'what', 'better', 'way', 'do', 'age', 'old', 'tradition', 'buying', 'one', 'way', 'society', 'marriage', 'modern', 'American', 'version', 'story', 'One', 'Jay', 'Gatsby', 'former', 'Jimmy', 'Ganz', 'freshly', 'reinventing', 'indeterminate', 'service', 'American', 'military', 'World', 'War', 'loaded', 'cash', 'questionable', 'financial', 'resources', 'attempts', 'win', 'rather', 're-win', 'affections', 'one', 'Daisy', 'Buchanan', 'vision', 'perfect', 'life', 'companion', 'exemplar', 'old', 'money', 'crowd', 'crash', 'One', 'little', 'complication', 'however', 'way', 'found', 'married', 'brutish', 'wealthy', 'member', 'old', 'money', 'crowd', 'Gatsby', 'fumbling', 'lavish', 'attempts', 'lure', 'away', 'high', 'society', 'Long', 'Island', 'then', 'summer', 'watering', 'hole', 'old', 'money', 'core', 'story', 'Gatsby', 'trial', 'tribulations', 'way', 'narrated', 'Nick', 'Carroway', 'Gatsby', 'somewhat', 'unwitting', 'accomplice', 'matter', 'story', 'line', 'going', 'final', 'deadly', 'ending', 'morale-', 'very', 'rich', 'are', 'indeed', 'very', 'different', 'Moreover', 'someone', 'else', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'pick', 'up', 'messes', 'have', 'made', 'merely', 'move', 'may', 'serve', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'time', 'possibly', 'today', 'Certainly', 'nobody', 'chronicled', 'end', 'age', 'American', 'innocence', 'signaled', 'Jazz', 'Age', 'better', 'Fitzgerald.A', 'word', 'literary', 'merits', 'According', 'inevitable', 'changes', 'literary', 'fashion', 'as', 'well', 'literary', 'politics', 'Fitzgerald', 'long', 'leading', 'figure', 'canon', 'American', 'literature', 'been', 'somewhat', 'eclipsed', 'other', 'more', 'post-modernist', 'trends', 'firmly', 'believe', 'Western', 'canon', 'dire', 'need', 'expansion', 'include', 'third', 'world', 'woman', 'minority', 'voices', 'Fitzgerald', 'literary', 'merits', 'stand', 'own', 'tightly-', 'crafted', 'story', 'line', 'sense', 'language', 'flat-out', 'fact', 'knew', 'subject', 'matter', 'formed', 'basis', 'expositions', 'merit', 'renewed', 'consideration', 'today', 'reader', 'Simply', 'put', 'want', 'understand', 'part', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'America', '1920', 'Great', 'Crash', '1929', 'then', 'simply', 'have', 'read', 'man', 'nothing', 'else', 'read', 'last', 'few', 'pages', 'Gatsby', 'better', 'literary', 'expression', 'promise', 'America', 'seem', 'early', 'Dutch', 'settlers', 'New', 'York', 'last', 'best', 'hope', 'civilization', 'failure', 'promise', 'hands', 'robber', 'barons', 'descendents', 'have', 'not', 'read']",N/A

248012,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,6301247485,Andre Dursin,"[3, 3]","One of the major cinematic disappointments of its day, the 1974 adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's ""The Great Gatsby"" is likely to be reassessed by viewers in lieu of the release of Baz Luhrmann's upcoming, and obviously more flamboyant, version starring Leonardo DiCaprio that opens May 10th. The perfect way to do so is through Warner Home Video's gorgeous new Blu-Ray presentation that, if nothing else, plays to the film's visual strengths.Directed in an apathetic manner by Jack Clayton - whose career ranged from highlights like ""The Innocents"" to several disappointments including ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" - ""The Great Gatsby"" boasts a script by Francis Ford Coppola, who came into save the expensive Paramount/David Merrick production after Truman Capote's prior adaptation was vetoed by the studio. The film cast Robert Redford as the enigmatic title character, Mia Farrow as Gatsby's eternal flame - Daisy Buchanan, Bruce Dern as her husband Tom, and Sam Waterston as Nick Carraway, Daisy's second cousin and a new arrival on the Long Island social scene circa 1925.Carraway, who narrates the film and serves as the story's social conscience, watches from a distance as the upper-crust of ""West Egg"" commits innumerable acts of selfishness, with Tom cheating on Daisy with the wife (Karen Black) of a local mechanic (Scott Wilson), and Daisy herself rekindling her lost love for the withdrawn Gatsby. As embodied by Redford, Gatsby is a tortured soul whose lavish parties are merely a facade for his emotional longing for Daisy's love. His desire to recapture the past dooms his future, with writer Coppola occasionally foreshadowing the tragedy that eventually befalls the vapid characters of Fitzgerald's novel.Coppola has written that Clayton paid scant attention to his screenplay, but while there's no question the film would've likely fared better with Coppola - at the time coming off the smash success of ""The Godfather"" - behind the lens, Clayton does capture enough of Coppola's adaptation that the movie isn't the total loss its reputation would lead you to believe. It's true that the movie's emotional aspect is detached from one end of the film to the other, and that the needed chemistry between Redford and Farrow never sparks (Farrow reportedly wrote that Redford's constant interest in the Watergate scandal kept him glued to the TV set whenever the cameras weren't rolling - something that may explain their lack of chemistry and Redford's disinterested performance). Scenes linger that should've been tightened up while Clayton keeps too much of the film on an even-keeled, dramatic flatline, and familiar faces from Edward Herrmann to Howard Da Silva (who also appeared in ""Gatsby""'s 1949 film version) appear in parts retained from the novel that don't offer any payoff on-screen.Yet ""The Great Gatsby"" still functions as an exquisitely good looking period film - a superficial romance that, despite its lack of emotional power, nevertheless manages to captivate for its sense of time and place. Making great use of  Newport, Rhode Island mansions like Rosecliff, Marble House and The Breakers (subbing for Long Island), Clayton and cinematographer Douglas Slocombe capture the gaudy heyday of the `20s in all its beauty and excess. And what more needs to be said about Nelson Riddle's Oscar-winning soundtrack? Beautifully adapted from numerous standards as well as offering an effective, low-key dramatic underscore, Riddle's work on ""The Great Gatsby"" is some of his finest. His use of George Gershwin's ""What I'll Do,"" weaving in and out of the score from the movie's first frames, is heartbreakingly poignant, and gives the film a soul that its otherwise overly-placid tone lacks. (Here's hoping someone releases Riddle's score on CD at some point soon).The movie's visual appearance, as well as its soundtrack, are both greatly enhanced by Warner's Blu-Ray presentation, which looks pleasingly natural with fine grain and detail present throughout (the details are so distinct you can easily see the old Jamestown [RI] Bridge in the movie's opening minutes). This is a beautiful 1080p AVC encoded presentation and another home run for Warner, releasing their first new title from the Paramount Pictures vaults as part of a recent catalog distribution agreement between the two studios. On the audio end, the 5.1 DTS MA soundtrack is surprisingly robust with a pleasing stereophonic presence.While those expecting ""The Great Gatsby"" to become the `70s equivalent of ""Gone With Wind""

248013,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301247485,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","A lavish cast, impeccable landscape, flawless costumes, a classic novel, Frances Ford Coppola (at the writer's desk); recipe for success, right?  Well, I thought so too, but when all was said and done, `The Great Gatsby' appeared as nothing more than a pretty picture.  It is void of any real character development, casting aside the heart of the films central cast for the likes of pretty dresses, snazzy suits and beautiful music.  Sure, `The Great Gatsby' isn't all bad, but it surely isn't `great'.The story is your classic love triangle.  Daisy is married to Tom.  Tom is unfaithful, giving the majority of his love to Myrtle, who is the unhappy housewife of the poor George.  Daisy at one time was in love with Jay, who also happened to be poor, and so when he went off to the war she married Tom, who is not poor.  Now Jay is back, and he is rather wealthy, and so Daisy begins her affair with him.  All of this is seen and observed by Nick, Daisy's cousin and Jay's neighbor, who just so happens to narrate the story for us; the audience.What is sad about this adaptation is that the story really doesn't unveil itself to be anything deeper than what I just typed in the above paragraph.  There is little more that is embellished in regards to the core of these relationships.  Everything appears as mere surface.  It's there simply to justify having a film made, the focus being more on the flashy costumes and splendid musical arrangements.One aspect of the film that does work in it's favor is the acting, especially by the supporting cast.  Robert Redford and Mia Farrow are nice to look at, and Farrow does have some nicely crafted moments, but for the most part they are the least interesting characters and the least impressive actors.  Redford is always someone who bores me (except in a few films, like `The Sting') and so I wasn't surprised at the fact that he left me cold and distant here.  Farrow has her moments, but she also has a lot of stiff scenes.  Bruce Dern, Karen Black, Scott Wilson, Sam Waterston and the ravishing Lois Chiles are a different story though.  Dern is amazing as Tom, the coldhearted husband to Daisy; and Black just ignites as his lover.  Chiles is probably my favorite here, her distilled sensuality just entices me to keep watching her.  Sam Waterston was the perfect choice for Nick, for he has this almost chilled demeanor that makes for a worthy observer.  You can see him judging, if only from a distance, and thus he allows us to grasp what he sees without manipulating our own feelings.So, I'd recommend this for the stellar performances and crisp visuals alone, but if you are looking for a film that will stimulate you mentally as well as visually then you might want to look elsewhere.  It is a truly tragic and moving story, but this film adaptation doesn't capture that as well as it should have.",3,"Forsaking substance for style, resulting in a rather hollow attempt at Fitzgerald...",1237766400,"03 23, 2009",2009,2856,"['lavish', 'cast', 'impeccable', 'landscape', 'flawless', 'costumes', 'classic', 'novel', 'Frances', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'writer', 'desk', 'recipe', 'success', 'right', 'Well', 'thought', 'so', 'too', 'when', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'appeared', 'nothing', 'more', 'pretty', 'picture', 'void', 'real', 'character', 'development', 'casting', 'aside', 'heart', 'films', 'central', 'cast', 'likes', 'pretty', 'dresses', 'snazzy', 'suits', 'beautiful', 'music', 'Sure', 'Great', 'Gatsby', ""n't"", 'bad', 'surely', ""n't"", ""great'.The"", 'story', 'classic', 'love', 'triangle', 'Daisy', 'married', 'Tom', 'Tom', 'unfaithful', 'giving', 'majority', 'love', 'Myrtle', 'who', 'unhappy', 'housewife', 'poor', 'George', 'Daisy', 'one', 'time', 'was', 'love', 'Jay', 'who', 'also', 'happened', 'be', 'poor', 'so', 'when', 'went', 'war', 'married', 'Tom', 'who', 'not', 'poor', 'Now', 'Jay', 'back', 'rather', 'wealthy', 'so', 'Daisy', 'affair', 'seen', 'observed', 'Nick', 'Daisy', 'cousin', 'Jay', 'neighbor', 'who', 'just', 'so', 'narrate', 'story', 'audience.What', 'sad', 'adaptation', 'story', 'really', ""n't"", 'unveil', 'be', 'anything', 'deeper', 'what', 'just', 'typed', 'above', 'paragraph', 'little', 'more', 'embellished', 'regards', 'core', 'relationships', 'Everything', 'mere', 'surface', 'there', 'simply', 'justify', 'having', 'film', 'made', 'focus', 'being', 'more', 'flashy', 'costumes', 'splendid', 'musical', 'arrangements.One', 'aspect', 'film', 'work', 'favor', 'acting', 'especially', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'are', 'nice', 'look', 'Farrow', 'have', 'nicely', 'crafted', 'moments', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'least', 'interesting', 'characters', 'least', 'impressive', 'actors', 'Redford', 'always', 'someone', 'who', 'few', 'films', 'Sting', 'so', 'was', ""n't"", 'surprised', 'fact', 'left', 'cold', 'distant', 'here', 'Farrow', 'moments', 'also', 'lot', 'stiff', 'scenes', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'Karen', 'Black', 'Scott', 'Wilson', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'ravishing', 'Lois', 'Chiles', 'are', 'different', 'story', 'Dern', 'amazing', 'Tom', 'coldhearted', 'husband', 'Daisy', 'Black', 'just', 'lover', 'Chiles', 'probably', 'favorite', 'here', 'distilled', 'sensuality', 'just', 'keep', 'watching', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'Nick', 'almost', 'chilled', 'demeanor', 'worthy', 'observer', 'can', 'see', 'judging', 'only', 'distance', 'thus', 'grasp', 'what', 'manipulating', 'own', 'feelings.So', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'stellar', 'performances', 'crisp', 'visuals', 'alone', 'are', 'looking', 'film', 'will', 'stimulate', 'mentally', 'as', 'well', 'visually', 'then', 'might', 'want', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'truly', 'tragic', 'moving', 'story', 'film', 'adaptation', ""n't"", 'capture', 'as', 'well', 'should', 'have']",N/A

Scott Fitzgerald's famous book; no directorial hijinks or attempts to rewrite the author's characters. The production values are excellent; the wild parties at Gatsby's are impressive indeed; the ash strewn desolation at George Wilson's gas station could have been a moonscape. All the actors rose nobly to the occasion (although I did think that Mia Farrow's Daisy was rather shallower than Fitzgerald might have intended); Sam Waterston was suitably understated as Nick Carraway, Bruce Dern was marvelously overbearing as Tom Buchanan, Scott Wilson was wholly convincing as George Wilson, a man stretched beyond his psychological limits, Lois Chiles flitted deliciously on the periphery as Jordan Baker.  Robert Redford - and please note that I am in no sense of the word a Redford fan - was perfect as Gatsby, a role that it would be easy to overplay (or otherwise ruin). He handled it beautifully.

The 1920s even though called ""The Roaring Twenties"" was also known as ""The Plastic Age"" because it was an era built on a balloon of plastic dreams, and plastic lives not worrying for tomorrow just ready to bust (which did come the great depression). A time of people running around without much care of what may happen (one reason leading to the stock crash of 1929). This film shows some of the laid back almost complete naive mentality the upper class had during this era. An era of care freeness at anyone's expense that hit the USA post WWI, and some circles wearing plastic masks over their true identity.  A good example of this are two films staring Clara Bow entitled ""It"" or ""Wild Party"" from 1927 and 1929. This movie shows you great early 20th century prop sceneries, and yes, it does stick to the book as close as it can. It's the best version I have seen and each character fits the novel characters about how they should be.  There have been other film versions of this book including a 1926 silent film (considered lost), and a 1949 ""modern"" version which is awful. This is the best film to date for The Great Gatsby. It takes you into a world...a time you'll long want to experience...but at the same time want to leave some of the superficial characters behind. An era where technology was just starting to take off (no air conditions yet), but motor engineering was starting to hit its peak. An era where life for some was just one big party whether from underground establishments from prohibition or money gained elsewhere into The Depression hit in October 1929 and Prohibition ended in 1933 when all that ended. You can't sit in this movie looking to nitpick every this or that. You have to enter this film knowing or wanting to enter a world...a time...different than our own for the two and half or so hours of this movies length. Five out of Five stars.

Gatsby remains unmarried, keeps a huge scrapbook with clippings of Daisy's travels and socialite activities and will not quit thinking and dreaming of winning Daisy back.Living in Midwestern America, Nick Carraway (Sam Waterston) reads about mansion-building and wild social goings-on in the Northeast and moves into a cottage in Long Island to observe and satisfy his curiosity.  His cottage is next door to newly rich Gatsby's outrageously huge mansion.  Nick becomes Gatsby's best friend and confidant, giving the deepest possible insights into newly rich goings-on.  Early in the movie, Tom is portrayed as a fundamentally rotten person who regularly abuses Daisy who sticks with him to avoid losing her social standing.  Gatsby plays the role of a seldom seen, fabulously wealthy and refined gentleman with an Oxford University accent who throws huge outdoor parties that he watches through a window without attending, hoping Daisy will appear as a celebrant.As the movie develops from the beginning to an approach to the ending, almost everyone with a speaking role except Nick turns out to be a rotten person.  During the same interval, the masses of couples at Gatsby's parties seem to be highly educated airheads with almost identical behavior patterns, clothing, assumed superiority smiles and mechanically rehearsed Charleston dancing techniques.  Nick arranges for a meeting between Daisy and Gatsby, leading to their love being restored.  Tom sees that he is losing Daisy and learns to hate Gatsby.  Myrtle dies in an accident, Tom tells George it was caused by Gatsby, causing George to become allied with Tom in hating Gatsby.  The movie reveals two more violent events before ending.  Nick seems to be the lone wonderful person throughout most of the movie, but he slowly drifts toward becoming like those who surround him and in the last scene, Nick is forced to choose between promoting justice or casting his lot with the new friends he has made.The complexity of this film extends beyond its internal structure and into the realm of its lasting impact on its viewers, the cultures they live in and future generations.  One could think of it a classic love triangle, a historical account of uncaring and frantic wealth-builders in America's 1920s, a documentary on the pitfalls of inequality disguised as entertainment or something different as shaped by open-minded viewers.Bruce Dern as Tom Buchanan, Karen Black as Myrtle Wilson and Scott Wilson are perfectly cast and do excellent work as actors.  Mia Farrow as Daisy Buchanan goes all out to be the best Daisy possible, but with her limited body and oversized eyes does not look like someone the newly rich Gatsby would pine over for many years.  Robert Redford looks like the perfect Gatsby, but plays Robert Redford throughout.",5,"Jack Clayton Directs Robert Redford, Mia Farrow and Bruce Dern in 1974 Film Adaptation of 1925 F.

The reviews which call it a clothes and sets show are simply misapprehending.  The seeming clarity of the deservedly classic book is all surface, sustained only by the incredible invention of Nick Carraway, who carries the enigmatic and terse narrative like a sort of moody jazz age song.  Beneath that surface is a yawning cavern of distrurbing emptiness, symbolized by the ""valley of ashes"" and keying in directly to T. S. Eliot's ""The Wasteland.""  To go beyond a suggestive surface is to risk plunging the whole project quickly into heavy darkness, which this film carefully avoids.The brio of the direction shows in a cluster of marvelous choices, some very fleeting:  Sam Waterston as an impeccable Carraway; the too-carefully accented, stumbling diction of Redford who truly reflects -- as he is supposed to -- one who acquired his speech from ""how to"" books; bringing Klipspringer, the pianist-guest who never leaves, fully to life; the twinlike, dancing lesbians at the party; giving the heavy, Tom Buchanan, at least the benefit of being comic relief.All of this, however, is only to make way for the central bold choice:  casting Mia Farrow as Daisy.  Her shallow interpretation and apparently hysterical, ditzed-out performance spoils the film for many, and perhaps always will.  However, in my view (which is certainly open to question) this simply unmasks the central enigma of the book which is not fully apparent at all on paper, and never could be.  Why this obsession?  It is what drives not only the surface action of the book but also the symbolic understructure.One shakes his head, says, ""There must have been more than this.""  I think not.  The key is in Gatsby's pregnant, odd observation, ""Her voice sounds like . . . money.""Perhaps such a thing simply cannot be filmed.  However to me, the film adds a marvelous dimension to an American classic not achievable in any other way.

That said, I ordered the Blu-ray version hoping the film might get a remastering. It doesn't seem so. The DVD version had visible grain and occasional specks and flecks. So does this 2013 Blu-ray edition. So, if you have the DVD, you have the Blu-ray; this is a straight transfer from whatever source the DVD used. Still, it's one attractive film. Bonus features? None, which is unbelievable considering how virtually the entire cast is still alive and many of them are still working. I'm pretty sure no one asked them, either. Although Paramount owns the film, the Blu-ray release was produced by Warners. A guess: even with the much-delayed but about-to-be-released 2013 Baz Lurhman film just around the corner, Paramount had no plans to take advantage of interest in their own 40-year old film.

Just the film, and even that comes with the skimpiest of menus.Fun facts: Sam Waterston got a Golden Globe nomination for his performance - as Most Promising Newcomer.I'm hoping someone gets the smart idea to finally release Nelson Riddle's score - the one he got his only Oscar for - on CD.",4,Blu-ray Remastered?

Aldredge's costume now looks cheap and unglamorous.The party and crowd scenes lack any joy or fun of the bygone jazz age.According to Leonard Maltin's review of this film:  A bland adaptation, faithful to the book, but lacks substance and power.That says it all.",2,A Lackluster Film Adaptation,1380585600,"10 1, 2013",2013,1274,"['viewing', 'new', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'splendid', 'film', 'adaptation', 'reviewed', 'Jack', 'Clayton', '1974', 'film', 'adaptation', 'DVDwith', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'comparison.I', 'saw', 'film', '1974', 'theatre', 'recollection', 'was', 'long', 'boring', 'not', 'very', 'impressive.Almost', '40', 'years', 'film', 'now', 'looked', 'dated', 'poorly', 'directed', 'acted', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'book.Film', 'different', 'medium', 'book.To', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'viewers', 'must', 'be', 'moved', 'love', 'longing', 'Gatsby', 'Daisy.Mia', 'Farrow', 'was', 'wrongly', 'cast', 'Daisy', 'much', 'too', 'mature', 'behaving', '14', 'year', 'old.Robert', 'Redford', 'can', 'never', 'express', 'pain', 'vulnerability', 'poor', 'choice', 'Gatsby', 'love', 'passion', 'Daisyare', 'essential', 'make', 'film', 'work.Bruce', 'Dern', 'acted', 'bully', 'not', 'moment', 'believable', 'polo', 'playing', 'rich', 'boy.Only', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'was', 'able', 'maintain', 'acting', 'dignity', 'narrator', 'Nick', 'Carraway.The', 'film', 'received', '2', 'Oscar', 'awards', 'costume', 'design', 'musical', 'score.Theoni', 'V.', 'Aldredge', 'costume', 'now', 'cheap', 'unglamorous.The', 'party', 'crowd', 'scenes', 'lack', 'joy', 'fun', 'bygone', 'jazz', 'age.According', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'review', 'film', 'bland', 'adaptation', 'faithful', 'book', 'substance', 'power.That']",N/A

248043,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,6301247485,C. B Collins Jr.,"[0, 0]","This version of the great American novel, The Great Gatsby, is an excellent screen adaptation with outstanding performances by the actors. Robert Redford is able to capture the multiple aspects of Gatsby including his ambiguity and his dreams. Redford plays Gatsby like a poker player, as a cunning man who holds back what is going on in his mind. This makes him all the more human when we realize he has been chasing an illusion for many years.Mia Farrow is excellent as Daisy Buchanan; vulnerable, weak, uncertain, and fragile. Daisy is a complex character, feminine and flower like, protected by wealth and privilege, yet a prisoner of her bad choices. It is important that Daisy come across as an over protected, slightly neurotic, morally weak person since it has to be clear that Gatsby is chasing illusion rather than reality and illusion eventually vaporizes and brings about his downfall.Bruce Dern plays her husband Tom Buchanan and perfectly demonstrates that this novel is far more than a love story but is also about classism and the fact that money can purchase insulation from reality and avoidance of consequences that must be faced by those of the middle and lower classes. Dern skillfully reveals Tom's cunning and shrewdness.  Karen Black as Myrtle Wilson gives the best performance of her career. Sam Waterston is perfect as Nick. This is a difficult part to play since he is the confidant of all parties, he sees and hears all, yet he has to be unobtrusive, a shadow, and a reliable voice.The story is tightly structured with a likable credible narrator who has access to all parties. He observes this tragedy but he sees that it is not only personal tragedy but that wealth and privilege allows some to walk away from crisis while others pay the ultimate price.

Tashiro,"[2, 6]","Promoted heavily at the time of its release for its glamour and high style, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is a surprisingly limp film with little of either. There's nothing outstanding about it which, given the money and talent that went into it, is a pretty damning comment. The Newport locations are wasted, and most of the actors come off little better. Ralph Lauren's fashions (highly touted prior to the film's release) don't seem especially special, and Douglas Slocombe's cinematography is disappointingly soft and low contrast. Indeed, the only real sign of the film's budget are the loving shots of expensive cars, clothing and crockery and the endless, over-crowded party scenes. Both give new definition to the word pointless.At the peak of his career, Robert Redford is not bad, but does not seem very well cast and doesn't look that good. Mia Farrow, on the other hand, is too well cast as the flighty, self-indulgent Daisy of his dreams, managing to annoy much more than charm. Bruce Dern is grossly out of scale to the rest of the cast; his racist, brutal posturings seem to belong in another movie. Sam Waterston manages not to disgrace himself in the thankless role of the silent witness to other people's affairs. The only above average performance is by Scott Wilson as the mechanic, George, and even he could stand to have a beat or two trimmed from his suffering.The biggest problem with the movie is its all too apparent effort to overwhelm. A much lighter approach, even an ironic one, would seem to suit the material more effectively. Heavy with the attempt to be atmospheric, it feels overstuffed and tentative. There is no sense that anyone behind or in front of the camera had a driving passion to put the story on the screen, or even bothered to ask why it was being made.

Mia Farrow as Daisy, Bruce Dern as Tom Buchanan, and Sam Waterston as Nick Carroway seemed like they just walked right out of the book. The House, the parties, the Valley of Ashes, the yellow convertible, it's all here. The eyes of Dr. Eckleberg keep peeping out and looking (examining?)the strange behavior of the participants in this seemingly fantastical yet very American drama of &quot;have's vs have-not's&quot;. So many of the events are almost identical to the book. So why do I give this movie 4 stars instead of 5? The only flaw, in my opinion, is Robert Redford. And please don't misunderstand me, I like Redford a lot in other movies. But as Jay Gatsby? He's just a little too crisp, clean, and mature. A little bit too serene and confident to quite make it to the awkward plane of Jay Gatsby, people-pleaser and approval-seeker. Gatsby is a nervous want-to-be, trying to get approval from &quot;old money&quot; people. He wants to be liked by everyone--he throws parties to prove that he's &quot;great&quot;. Redford is just too slick, I think, to really give that sense of wanting--wanting to be approved by Daisy and the others around him. He wants everyone to like him, which makes some, particularly Nick Carroway, frustrated with him. But how could you possibly not like Robert Redford? He never once comes off as nervous. I think that Redford's physical &quot;look&quot; works, but the portrayal was not quite there for me. Still, I think it the best rendition of the Great Gatsby yet done on film, and I do think that F.

Last night we were looking over Amazon's streaming video library and decided, on an impulse, to watch ""The Great Gatsby"" and are very pleased to have made that decision.The movie has a different feeling to it from the very beginning; one gets the idea this movie is going to be different and one is correct in that assumption. The movie follows the lives of a small group who live privileged lives of wealth and ease; one is reminded of the British stories of the landed gentry who had more time and money than good sense.The story is handled in retrospect from the perspective of a young man named, Nick Carraway, played by Sam Waterston, who has moved from the Midwest to Long Island and lives in a small cottage next door to a wealthy, but mysterious man named Jay Gatsby, played by Robert Redford. The acting by the entire cast is effective and powerful and carries the viewer along on a ride not to be soon forgotten.We were both surprised at the ending which I'll not reveal here, but found the movie to be a worthwhile and memorable experience.

248065,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,6301247485,Deborah Earle,"[0, 0]","In hindsight, I find it intriguing and impressive that Irving Berlin lived  to see some of his music given such dramatic and emotional treatment , courtesy of Nelson Riddle in Francis Ford Coppola's offering--The ""Gatsby"" of my youth.More than the 2013 version, this 1974 release feels more in sync with F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel, although both yield some salient points of the story.An appropriately cast Sam Waterston, who specializes in playing sage-like characters, narrates this fateful tale of the Jazz Age as Wall Street broker and  aspiring writer, Nick Carraway, who would age 12 lifetimes by the time it is over.The tale he relates is a cautionary one, in which he struggles to reserve judgement given  the admonishment his father  gave him in childhood: ""Whenever you feel like criticizing someone, remember  that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you have.""Amid the sailboats and yachts  of the bay of Long Island in the summer of 1922, Carraway fumbles with his humble speedboat en route to see his  cousin, Daisy Buchanan, played by an appropriately  wide-eyed and waifish Mia Farrow, whose hazy, tulle-embellished wardrobe is reflective of her character, who lives with her head in the clouds, is extremely spoiled, and incapable of facing  responsibility for her more serious actions.After Nick is greeted by Daisy's polo- playing husband  Tom, ( a characteristically unpleasant Bruce Dern), who knew him at Yale, the two go inside the Buchanan's East Egg mansion where they are greeted by  Daisy in the room adjacent to the terrace where  white tulle curtains grace the entrance and another white-clad lady who has been lying on an adjacent couch, golfer, Jordan Baker(Lois Chiles), is introduced to Nick.As they are about to dine on the terrace, the light atmosphere resulting from pleasantries exchanged between the cousins changes to a desperate attempt to conceal the unhappiness of the union when Tom excuses himself to take a phone call in another room, and irate  Daisy follows , and literally and figuratively, the curtains thinly veil the dysfunction of the couple as Jordan explains that Tom is cheating on his cousin. Tom's bigoted rant regarding a book he's been reading called ""The Rise of the Colored Empires"" further poisons the mood.Daisy's desperately cheerful repartee does not hide her sadness as she  leans against the terrace, noting the loveliness of a bird's song.Visuals of birds will be very symbolic in this film as they come to represent the characters' elusive happiness, as does the green light at the end of the Buchanan's dock.In addition to his reunion with his cousin that  eventful summer, Nick, who rents a small cottage in between the grand mansions of the nouveau riche , ponders the mysterious next-door-neighbor who frequently host lavish parties at his mansion.We learn that the Buchanans  have spent  the few years that they have been married wandering  aimlessly around the U.S. and Europe. In due time, we will learn why, as we will also learn the reason behind all the parties.Initially using the ruse of lunching at the Yale Club,  Tom eventually takes Nick on an outing to meet his mistress, Myrtle Wilson(the late Karen Black, giving an earthy and tough  portrayal of a desperate woman enjoying an ill-fated , and not-altogether-happy moment of borrowed glory), the wife of gas station owner, George Wilson, living in a desolate part of town near a pile of ash heaps.One imagines  how difficult it must have been for nick  to watch  his college friend cheat on his cousin, especially  after hearing  lament  about Tom's absence during the birth of their daughter, Pamela( Patsy Kensit, who later portrayed Mia Farrow in a biopic), and Daisy's feeble hopes for her daughter.During the encounter with Myrtle, the two purchase a puppy for the apartment where they rendezvous, the reluctant Nick speaks with Myrtle's sister, Catherine(Kathryn Leigh Scott), hears Myrtles desperate tale of her meeting with Tom, and sees the generally misanthropic Tom mistreat her.Nick receives an invitation to attend a party next door, and soon finds himself enthralled with party-goers' stories about their mysterious host, who never attended his own previously hosted parties. He meets Jordan there.After witnessing a brawl, Gatsby's bodyguard(John Devlin) tells Nick to accompany him to the mansion.The discreet servant  reveals nothing as they ride in the private elevator, but soon, Nick is shown into the study...I've seen the many portrayals  of Fitzgerald's most illustrious character. Alan Ladd's resembled an executive, in a slightly more accurate depiction of the story, a brunette Toby Stephens was naturalistic boyish, and perhaps slightly uneasy, as I remember it. Leo DiCaprio's portrayal was admirable but done with his characteristic frenzy.But Robert Redford was  the Jay Gatsby of my childhood, and here, he is staid and charismatic, frequently taking a naturalistic style that was all his own.In a fated yellow car, he later takes Nick to meet his acquaintance, Meyer Wolfsheim (Howard da Silva, who played George Wilson in the  1949 Alan Ladd version of this story) and they encounter Tom Buchanan, after which Gatsby disappears.Jordan Baker asks Nick to have Daisy to tea at his place to arrange a meeting with Gatsby, unbeknownst to Daisy.Both men have misgivings at some point, but the rendezvous occurs, and the love of a young socialite  had for a  young military officer  headed for war five years earlier is rekindled.Nick accompanies the two to Gatsby's house to have a look around. Edward Hermann's  self-imposed house guest, Klipspringer plays the piano as they do so.As Gatsby shows off his newly acquired wealth, tossing an array of shirts bought for him on a seasonal basis, making Daisy weep with remorse that his wealth had not been acquired sooner.In Nick's absence, they two discuss their time together in Louisville, Kentucky, here Daisy's family had entertained  officers at their home during the Great War, how that war separated them, how Gatsby's letters from overseas  gave her hope, and how  while she awaited his return, wealthy  Chicago heir Tom Buchanan invaded Louisville and in Daisy's words, ""blinded"" her 'with excitement"", giving her a pearl necklace worth thousands of dollars. On her wedding day, Jay's last letter arrived , Daisy's pleas about changing her mind were ignored, and despite drinking herself into a stupor, she and Tom married. Tearfully, she reminds Jay that ""Rich girls don't marry poor boys.""Both Buchanans  attend Gatsby's next party, and noticeably Daisy's evening gown is less modest that her previous attire throughout the film.Tom makes a point about finding out about Gatsby, and in the meantime, Daisy's affair with Jay begins as the parties he gave to attract her cease, and rumors  about Gatsby continue to swirl.Jay tells Nick he fired his servants to prevent gossip about him and daisy and while the audience knows what they're up to, there are no sexually explicit scenes.The feelings of sensuousness are subtle as the couple dance to Irving Berlin's ""What'll I Do?"", the recurring theme throughout this movie, around  a single white candle as Gatsby wears his uniform; Daisy's hand passing over the  bronze cake molds in Gatsby's kitchen  before placing her hand  on his is erotic enough.There is a poignant moment when Jay presents her with  an emerald ring, similar to the light on her dock, and for purposes of discretion she makes him wear it for her.Nick's tending to a dead seagull on the shoreline by Gatsby's mansion provides a further bit of foreshadowing.Douglas Slocombe's hazy, staid, and rather boxed-in cinematography, very much they style of the '70s maintains its lugubriousness throughout, as most of the principals are rather staid, and rarely explosively passionate until a confrontation at the Plaza Hotel.A horrendous incident subsequently occurs, and while we will see that chivalry isn't dead, three people will be in its wake, after one character cloaks the sins of another.A symbolic scene towards the end  will be that of a blue jay flying away.Nick will be devastated but wizened by the events of that long, hot summer, and the bitter lessons of cupidity, and misplaced desires will haunt him forever.",5,Ethereal and Tragic,1396396800,"04 2, 2014",2014,8292,"['hindsight', 'find', 'intriguing', 'impressive', 'Irving', 'Berlin', 'lived', 'see', 'music',

This movie version doesn't communicate any of the book's depth.  The director focuses the movie on Gatsby's and Daisy's brief romance. It is the main focus of the movie. But in the book, their 'romance' is a minor point. It doesn't occupy many pages at all. In fact, one interpretation of the book is that Daisy doesn't truly love Gatsby. Rather, he's just another plaything for this bored rich woman, one that allows her to get even with her brutal husband's affair that he flaunts in front of her before Gatsby shows up.The actors in the movie don't fit the characterization of the book. Bruce Dern portrays Tom Buchanan as weak. Fitzgerald shows Buchanan as a physically imposing, 6'3"", 220ib college football star, who turns every encounter into a contest, a contest he intends to win. Dern doesn't show Buchanan's sheer intimidation. Robert Redford is OK as Gatsby, but it's not a hard role, because there isn't much depth to Gatsby. The interesting characters in the book are Tom & Daisy Buchanan and Jordan. Mia Farrow portrays Daisy as weak, unstable and easily upset. Fitzgerald shows Daisy as uninterested, confident and manipulative of situations.This movie is a bust, but it's also 35yrs old. I hope a talented director and screenwriter see the opportunity for a new film interpretation about this magnificent book.-For film buffs, this movie is interesting in that it's a big money movie. Gatsby is released around the same time as Scorsese's & DeNiro's masterpieces of Taxi Driver and Raging Bull.  Those two geniuses to take Jake LaMotta's autobiography, and turn it into a cinematic masterpiece, one that is the forerunner of how films were made for the next couple decades. At the same time, Jack Clayton takes a masterpiece of a novel about dreams and wealth and ambition, the Great Gatsby, and removes all the interesting aspects of the book, and hands us only a tepid love story.  It's movies like Gatsby that show what a genius Scorsese is, because he takes everyday material and spins gold.",1,"Poorly written, confusing, bad direction.",1265932800,"02 12, 2010",2010,2168,"['Great', 'Gatsby', 'colorful', 'funny', 'panoramic', 'book', 'full', 'penetrating', 'individual', 'character', 'studies', 'strong', 'opinions', 'lives', 'wealthy', 'movie', 'version', ""n't"", 'communicate', 'book', 'depth', 'director', 'movie', 'Gatsby', 'Daisy', 'brief', 'romance', 'main', 'focus', 'movie', 'book', ""'romance"", 'minor', 'point', ""n't"", 'occupy', 'many', 'pages', 'fact', 'one', 'interpretation', 'book', 'Daisy', ""n't"", 'truly', 'love', 'Gatsby', 'Rather', 'just', 'plaything', 'bored', 'rich', 'woman', 'one', 'get', 'even', 'brutal', 'husband', 'affair', 'front', 'Gatsby', 'up.The', 'actors', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'characterization', 'book', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'Tom', 'Buchanan', 'weak', 'Fitzgerald', 'Buchanan', 'physically', 'imposing', '6', '3', '220ib', 'college', 'football', 'star', 'who', 'encounter', 'contest', 'contest', 'win', 'Dern', ""n't"", 'show', 'Buchanan', 'sheer', 'intimidation', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'OK', 'Gatsby', 'not', 'hard', 'role', ""n't"", 'much', 'depth', 'Gatsby', 'interesting', 'characters', 'book', 'are', 'Tom', 'Daisy', 'Buchanan', 'Jordan', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'Daisy', 'weak', 'unstable', 'easily', 'upset', 'Fitzgerald', 'Daisy', 'uninterested', 'confident', 'manipulative', 'situations.This', 'movie', 'bust', 'also', '35yrs', 'old', 'hope', 'talented', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'see', 'opportunity', 'new', 'film', 'interpretation', 'magnificent', 'book.-For', 'film', 'buffs', 'movie', 'interesting', 'big', 'money', 'movie', 'Gatsby', 'released', 'same', 'time', 'Scorsese', 'DeNiro', 'masterpieces', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'two', 'geniuses', 'take', 'Jake', 'LaMotta', 'autobiography', 'turn', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'forerunner', 'how', 'films', 'were', 'made', 'next', 'couple', 'decades', 'same', 'time', 'Jack', 'Clayton', 'masterpiece', 'novel', 'dreams', 'wealth', 'ambition', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'book', 'only', 'tepid', 'love', 'story', 'movies', 'Gatsby', 'show', 'what', 'genius', 'Scorsese', 'everyday', 'material', 'spins', 'gold']",N/A

Everything is just too shiny, even the interior of the Plaza Hotel, where Gatsby (Robert Redford) and Tom (Bruce Dern) have their climactic confrontation.  On the other hand Jack Clayton's adaptation offers several visual pleasures - for example his use of symbolism.  There are numerous shots of birds flying away, except for one sequence, where Nick (Sam Waterston) discovers a dead seagull on the seashore near his home.  This reminds us of how the protagonists - especially Gatsby and Daisy (Mia Farrow) - are imprisoned by their existences.  They might have money, but they cannot fly off like the birds into a new life.  The film also includes several shots of Gatsby and Daisy reflected in mirrors, or in the water of the outdoor pool at Gatsby's mansion, drawing attention to the doomed nature of their affair.  It is as if they cannot endure the idea of face-to-face contact; when they do get close, they seem ill-at-ease, despite their protestations of love.  While Gatsby believes that the past can be recreated, Clayton's film proves otherwise.  Redford is strangely muted as Gatsby; he certainly looks the past, especially when photographed alone standing on the jetty against the early evening sky, but he seems reluctant to show Gatsby's passionate nature lurking beneath the civilized veneer.  Bruce Dern is quite outstanding as Tom - a thoroughly odious person with scant regard for anyone else's feelings, especially those of his wife.  Waterston's Nick acts as the narrator for the entire piece; his delivery of the book's final lines in voice-over is incredibly moving, especially when he contrasts Gatsby's naive hope for the future with Daisy and Tom's &#34;carelessness&#34; (Fitzgerald's phrase).

I just read the book for the first time in my life several weeks prior to watching this film [also for the first time], so it was fresh in my memory. I found the movie to be fairly acurrate to the book in most ways, even in tone.In my opinion, the novel &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is one of those art pieces that, like the Disco music and leisure suits of the 1970s, hasn't dated well. But that, is precisely what keeps it alive now. For better or worse, there are fewer things created during &quot;the roaring twenties&quot; that define the era in present-day peoples' imaginations more than &quot;the Great Gatsby&quot; by F. Scott Fitzgerald.But what I wonder, is how relevent this story is anymore? Perhaps it's the story of the Great Gatsby that fails to move modern audiences any longer that makes this film not the masterpiece that it should be? I wondered that as I watched this movie. Because all the elements are superb: Robert Redford is inspired as Gatsby and all the casting, the costuming, the music, etc is wonderful here. This is a strong film! In other words, I am suggesting that if the film bores you, so would the original novel likely bore you as well.The DVD is fine - it isn't a spectacular treatment, nor are there an overwhelming amount of extras, etc. But the picture-quality is nice and the sound is average for a modern-day DVD.

248078,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6301247485,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 5]","It seems something of a shame how maligned the extravagant 1974 movie version of F. Scott Fitzgerald's literary masterwork was when it was originally released. So much media hype surrounded the production, including a Scarlett O'Hara-level search for the right actress to play Daisy Buchanan, that it was bound to disappoint, and it did critically and financially. It's simply not that bad. Interestingly, looking at the film over thirty years later, I am taken by how faithful the movie is to the original book both in text and period atmosphere. The central problem, however, is that Jack Clayton's overly deliberate direction and Francis Ford Coppola's literate screenplay are really too faithful to the book to the point where the spirit of Fitzgerald's story becomes flattened and plot developments are paced too slowly. The result is an evocative but overlong 144-minute epic movie based on a novel that is really quite intimate in scope.The focus of the plot is still the interrupted love story between Jay Gatsby and his object of desire, Daisy. Narrating the events is Nick Carraway, Gatsby's modest Long Island neighbor who becomes his most trusted confidante. Nick is responsible for reuniting the lovers who both have come to different points in their lives five years after their aborted romance. Now a solitary figure in his luxurious mansion, Gatsby is a newly wealthy man who accumulated his fortunes through dubious means. Daisy, on the other hand, has always led a life of privilege and could not let love stand in the way of her comfortable existence. She married Tom Buchanan for that sole purpose. With Gatsby's ambition spurred by his love for Daisy, he rekindles his romance with Daisy, as Tom carries on carelessly with Myrtle Wilson, an auto mechanic's grasping wife. Nick himself gets caught up in the jet set trappings and has a relationship with Jordan Baker, a young golf pro. The characters head for a collision, figuratively and literally, that exposes the hypocrisy of the rich, the falsity of a love undeserving and the transience of individuals on this earth.Casting is crucial, and surprisingly, most of the actors fulfill the characters well. Robert Redford, at the height of his box office appeal, plays Gatsby with the right enigmatic quality. As Daisy, Mia Farrow captures the romanticism and shallowness of a character that ultimately does not deserve the love she receives. Even if she appears overly breathy and pretentious, her frequently trying performance still fits Fitzgerald's image of the character. Bruce Dern makes an appropriately despicable Tom Buchanan, while Karen Black has scant screen time as the trashy Myrtle. A very young Sam Waterson makes the ideal Nick with his genuine manner and touching naivet&eacute;, and Lois Chiles is all throaty posturing as Jordan. As expected, all the exterior touches are luxuriant and feel period-authentic - Theoni V. Aldredge's costumes, John Box's production design, Douglas Slocombe's elegant cinematography, and the pervasive use of 1920's hits, in particular, Irving Berlin's wistful ""What'll I Do?"" as the recurring love theme. The film is worth a look if you have not seen it and a second one if you haven't seen it in a while. It's actually better if you've already read the book.

Recall this passage from the book:--""About Gatsby! No, I haven't. I said I'd been making a small investigation of his past.""""And you found he was an Oxford man,"" said Jordan helpfully.""An Oxford man!"" He was incredulous. ""Like hell he is! He wears a pink suit.""""Nevertheless he's an Oxford man.""""Oxford, New Mexico,"" snorted Tom contemptuously, ""or something like that.""--Tom quips ""Oxford, New Mexico"" here to mock the notion that Gatsby could have possibly graduated from Oxford.  While Oxford University represents the ultimate in upper class respectability to blue-blooded Easterners like himself, anything having to do with New Mexico is no doubt considered vulgar and hopelessly lower class.  Tom ""snorts"" the words ""Oxford, New Mexico"" because it is literally laughable to him that a nobody like Gatsby would try to pass himself off as an upper class elite.But in the movie, Tom does not ""snort"" the words.  He looks at Jordan with a serious expression and and says ""Oxford, New Mexico"" in a chiding tone, like a father reprimanding his misbehaving young daughter.In other words, the filmmakers completely miss the point of that little exchange.

Perhaps I need to go back and re-read it?  I don't know.  What I do know is that this movie could have been done far better than it was.  The pacing of the movie was done poorly.  The first half of the movie drags then picks up steam towards the last hour or so.  While it's clear that the director tried to capture all of the wealthy, over top grandeur of the frivolous elite in the roaring 20s, it was done in a haphazard way and with not enough continuity.  It just didn't flow right.  Also, though Mia Farrow and Robert Redford were the two hot actors of the day when they were cast, they had absolutely no onscreen chemistry.  Onscreen chemistry is crucial to many love stories... it can literally make a so-so story/script or break a good one.  Though I am a Robert Redford fan (who couldn't be with those looks? lol) I don't think he fit.  Neither did Mia Farrow.  Perhaps if either of their roles were filled by someone else and there was better chemistry it would have worked.I haven't seen the new version with Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey McGuire, but I suspect, based on reviews and the previews I've seen, that I'm in for much of the same - lol.Where's Ang Lee when you need him??",2,Quite Boring for a Tragic Love Story,1379808000,"09 22, 2013",2013,1322,"['Having', 'read', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'teen', 'high', 'school', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'story', 'being', 'quite', 'as', 'boring', 'movie', 'version', 'Perhaps', 'need', 'go', 'back', 're-read', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'What', 'do', 'know', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'far', 'better', 'was', 'pacing', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'poorly', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'then', 'up', 'steam', 'last', 'hour', 'so', 'clear', 'director', 'tried', 'capture', 'wealthy', 'top', 'grandeur', 'frivolous', 'elite', 'roaring', '20s', 'was', 'done', 'haphazard', 'way', 'not', 'enough', 'continuity', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'flow', 'right', 'Also', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'were', 'two', 'hot', 'actors', 'day', 'when', 'were', 'cast', 'had', 'absolutely', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', 'Onscreen', 'chemistry', 'crucial', 'many', 'love', 'stories', 'can', 'literally', 'make', 'so-so', 'story/script', 'break', 'good', 'one', 'am', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'fan', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'looks', 'lol', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'fit', 'did', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'Perhaps', 'roles', 'were', 'filled', 'someone', 'else', 'was', 'better', 'chemistry', 'would', 'have', 'worked.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'new', 'version', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'Tobey', 'McGuire', 'suspect', 'based', 'reviews', 'previews', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'m"", 'much', 'same', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'when', 'need']",N/A

Scott Fitzgerald's novel of the man who pursues his preposterous dream. Robert Redford is utterly convincing as the enigmatic protagonist, Gatsby, whose personality ""seemed to face . . . the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you, with an irresistible prejudice in your favor"" [Fitzgerald, Chapter 3].  Young Sam Waterston portrays a believable Nick Carraway, Fitzgerald's narrator and empathetic observer; and while some reviewers have criticized Mia Farrow's performance, in my view, she is pitch perfect as the shallow, spoiled young woman whose ""artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes"" [F. Ch. 8]. Farrow's performance makes us understand how Daisy's porcelain beauty and fecklessness could ignite the obsession of a man who has, after all, invented his own persona. Both of them are equally unreal.The production values are superb. The settings, the music, and magnificent costumes--the pastel beaded silks and satin pumps, the feathered head-dresses--convincingly portray privileged wealth of the 1920s, which would soon plummet into the Depression--the great Valley of Ashes that infected the 1930s and indeed contaminated the entire twentieth century.",5,"A Great ""Gatsby""!",1216425600,"07 19, 2008",2008,1468,"['stunning', 'production', 'splendid', 'cinematography', 'intelligent', 'script', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'essence', 'F.', 'Scott', 'Fitzgerald', 'novel', 'man', 'who', 'preposterous', 'dream', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'utterly', 'convincing', 'enigmatic', 'protagonist', 'Gatsby', 'personality', 'seemed', 'face', 'whole', 'external', 'world', 'instant', 'then', 'concentrated', 'irresistible', 'prejudice', 'favor', '[', 'Fitzgerald', 'Chapter', '3', ']', 'Young', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'believable', 'Nick', 'Carraway', 'Fitzgerald', 'narrator', 'empathetic', 'observer', 'reviewers', 'have', 'criticized', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'performance', 'view', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'shallow', 'spoiled', 'young', 'woman', 'artificial', 'world', 'was', 'redolent', 'orchids', 'pleasant', 'cheerful', 'snobbery', 'orchestras', 'set', 'rhythm', 'year', 'summing', 'up', 'sadness', 'suggestiveness', 'life', 'new', 'tunes', '[', 'F.', 'Ch', '8', ']', 'Farrow', 'performance', 'understand', 'how', 'Daisy', 'porcelain', 'beauty', 'fecklessness', 'could', 'ignite', 'obsession', 'man', 'who', 'invented', 'own', 'persona', 'are', 'equally', 'unreal.The', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'superb', 'settings', 'music', 'magnificent', 'costumes', 'pastel', 'beaded', 'silks', 'satin', 'pumps', 'feathered', 'head-dresses', 'convincingly', 'portray', 'privileged', 'wealth', '1920s', 'would', 'soon', 'plummet', 'Depression', 'great', 'Valley', 'Ashes', 'infected', '1930s', 'indeed', 'contaminated', 'entire', 'twentieth', 'century']",N/A

Taylor ""GFT""","[10, 12]","Although she was greatly criticized, the ultimate failure of this adaptation does not rest upon actress Mia Farrow; it rests instead upon the on-going failure of film makers to successfully adapt Fitzgerald's sharp statement about American social classes, materialism, and hypocrisy for the screen.  This failure should not be entirely entirely unexpected: the famous story of an ill-fated love affair between a social-climbing bootlegger and a high society woman is not so much the core of Fitzgerald's novel as it is the platform from which makes his statement.  These literary effects simply do not translate well into film, and so once again (as in both other film versions of the novel) we are left with only the plot itself--and shorn of its broader implications the plot emerges as pretty thin stuff indeed.Farrow is actually quite good in the thankless role of Daisy Bucchannan, but since much of the novel's effect is based upon the other characters' opinions of Daisy's character, both script and over-all film fail her efforts.  To a certain extent, much the same can be said for the entire cast, but at least Robert Redford--then at the peak of his golden physical appeal--truly looks the part of the high-style bootlegger Jay Gatsby, and the primary supporting cast (Waterston, Black, and Dern) are plausibly cast.  But in spite of an interesting cast and first rate production values that effectively recreate the hard-edged glamour of the 1920s, the movie never seems to actually start: instead, it feels like one long exposition.  The viewer keeps waiting for the action to begin--and it never really does.  To say the film lacks excitement would be a profound understatement.I hesitate to actually give this film three stars; it really deserves but two.  Still, the art design is remarkable, and the overall look of the film is right, and the cast does the best they can with it, so I'll be generous.  Watch this version of THE GREAT GATSBY for its visuals alone and you'll enjoy it--but if you expect interest from any other quarter, you'll very disappointed indeed.",3,Lavish But Superficial,1009411200,"12 27, 2001",2001,2084,"['was', 'greatly', 'criticized', 'ultimate', 'failure', 'adaptation', 'not', 'rest', 'actress', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'instead', 'on-going', 'failure', 'film', 'makers', 'successfully', 'adapt', 'Fitzgerald', 'sharp', 'statement', 'American', 'social', 'classes', 'materialism', 'hypocrisy', 'screen', 'failure', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'entirely', 'entirely', 'unexpected', 'famous', 'story', 'ill-fated', 'love', 'affair', 'social-climbing', 'bootlegger', 'high', 'society', 'woman', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'core', 'Fitzgerald', 'novel', 'platform', 'statement', 'literary', 'effects', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'translate', 'well', 'film', 'so', 'once', 'again', 'other', 'film', 'versions', 'novel', 'are', 'left', 'only', 'plot', 'shorn', 'broader', 'implications', 'plot', 'pretty', 'thin', 'stuff', 'indeed.Farrow', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'thankless', 'role', 'Daisy', 'Bucchannan', 'much', 'novel', 'effect', 'based', 'other', 'characters', 'opinions', 'Daisy', 'character', 'script', 'over-all', 'film', 'fail', 'efforts', 'certain', 'extent', 'much', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'entire', 'cast', 'least', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'then', 'peak', 'golden', 'physical', 'appeal', 'truly', 'part', 'high-style', 'bootlegger', 'Jay', 'Gatsby', 'primary', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Waterston', 'Black', 'Dern', 'are', 'plausibly', 'cast', 'spite', 'interesting', 'cast', 'first', 'rate', 'production', 'values', 'effectively', 'recreate', 'hard-edged', 'glamour', '1920s', 'movie', 'never', 'actually', 'start', 'instead', 'one', 'long', 'exposition', 'viewer', 'waiting', 'action', 'begin', 'never', 'really', 'say', 'film', 'excitement', 'would', 'be', 'profound', 'understatement.I', 'hesitate', 'actually', 'give', 'film', 'three', 'stars', 'really', 'two', 'Still', 'art', 'design', 'remarkable', 'overall', 'look', 'film', 'right', 'cast', 'best', 'can', 'so', ""'ll"", 'be', 'generous', 'Watch', 'version', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'GATSBY', 'visuals', 'alone', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'expect', 'interest', 'other', 'quarter', ""'ll"", 'very', 'disappointed', 'indeed']",N/A

THE GREAT GATSBY, which makes anybody's list of the great American novels, may just be one. Having just seen this film again for the first time since its release, I think I need to reread the novel. The chief flaw of the movie is the casting of Mia Farrow as Daisy Buchanan. While she certainly can act and become hysterical at the smell of a room full of roses, it is difficult to understand the power that she holds on Gatsby. While Redford makes an adequate if not outstanding Gatsby, Sam Waterston, a very fine actor indeed, is perfectly cast as Gatsby's neighbor. Bruce Dern works as the boorish Tom Buchanan, Karen Black isn't bad as his woman on the side, and Scott Wilson as her cuckolded husband who seeks revenge is well cast.The music by Nelson Riddle, who won an Oscar for his efforts, is really quite wonderful. And the wardrobe department must have gone over its budget. As Buchanan snidely remarks at one point, Gatsby wears pink suits.While the movie get better towards the end, for much of over its two hours it moves far too slowly. Some of the photography should have been edited out.

248099,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,6301247485,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 1]","To really understand this film, or the novel behind, you have to keep in mind the alternative story that D.H. Lawrence tells us in Women in Love. In the same way we are dealing with love in the upper class of the very rich  before the First World War and then after before the big crisis of 1929. I will not compare the two here but the two films also came out in the same period, the early 1970s after the 1968 political and generational crisis. They both carry the denunciation of the upper class.We are telling the story from an outside point of view but yet close to the protagonists. The story teller, Mr. Nick Carraway, is a neighbor of Mr. Jay Gatsby and a bond seller in Wall Street, New York. Nothing to do with present time golden boys, the traders in Brokerage firms. Well-off but definitely not rich and anyway with no rich parents. Yet he is the cousin of another woman who is from an extremely rich family, married to an extremely rich man. Gatsby is the black sheep in the neighborhood.He is from an extremely poor family. He managed to get an Oxford education after 1918 because he became an officer and was heavily decorated during the war and he then took advantage of veterans' privileges. He had also the chance to fall in the hands of a certain Meyer Wolfsheim who introduced him to business, though we are never told what that business really is. We can imagine, due to the speed with which he became rich (less than eight years) that it had to be in some financial speculation in the 1920s. That period is clearly identified with the paraphernalia of the time and with the music, including the dancing, including the famous song Charleston. Note that Jay might not be a real first name, but an initial and that the name Gatsby is not the real name of the man who was the son of  a certain Mr. Gatz we see at the end. Note too that the name Wolfsheim is of course meaningful and the main principle of this man is ""we can be a friend of a man when he is alive, but not when he is dead.""At the end of WWI, Jay Gatsby, alias Major Gatz, fell in love with Daisy, a rich girl. But he was a poor man. She fell in love with him on a short-lived whim and he fell in love with her forever. But a rich girl does not marry a poor boy, as she says so well. So he disappears to build a fortune and she got married to a rich boy and became Mrs. Daisy Buchanan.  She had promised to wait but rich girls never wait.When he is finally rich he manages to get close to her and then to be introduced to her by her cousin, Nick Carraway, and before he had tried to attract her attention by having enormous garden parties every week end in that summer of 1926 or 1927. She eventually falls in the trap.The rest is to be discovered in the film, or the book.The morality, bad word, the immorality of this film is that in spite of the American Dream, rich people attract and mix with rich people and poor people can only eventually be accepted when they are rich. The second lesson is that rich people with a rich pedigree can always manage to get through any crime or accident or whatever particularly by pointing at another of their class but that does not have the rich pedigree they have. This immorality can even be worse: rich men can have as many poor mistresses they will furnish with some luxury as much, and as many, as they want or can afford. But a rich woman is not supposed to have any affair with a rich man of any sort, and she will not condescend to have an affair with a poor man. It would not be in anyway anything but a short and exciting sexual episode that would be doomed even before it starts, and like the praying mantis she would destroy the poor lover after using it.In other words a woman is the property of her husband but in no way the husband is the property of his wife, and social inequality is absolute in the USA, just like in Great Britain, in the 1920s just the way Henry James described it in his novels more than thirty years before. Nothing has changed.The narrator is able to express this immorality and that is the only moral element in this film, and novel. Morality is on the side here of the upper middle class, and a lower stratum in that upper middle class. That means there may be some hope for such a society that is doomed because the rich do not care for their neighbors in all the meanings of this word. They only care for their money and the gossips that can be aired around them about them.This older film shows these elements with great care but at the same time it is obvious Jay Gatsby is not natural as a rich man. He is not able to play the game properly: he is awkward, he is shy, he is inconsiderate in his presents and in his lavish help he may give to someone who is trying to make him realize one of his intentions or desires. One hundred white roses are not even enough in such a situation and he very well may send one thousand. The dialogue is good too in the fact that Jay Gatsby is the only one who has a linguistic idiosyncratic tick and he calls every man ""old sport"" and such an Oxfordian tic shows in him a rather recent integration in the class of the super rich: he cuts a role, a character, a behavior and sticks to it: he believes in a way the tuxedo makes the money aristocrat. And he is wrong: the money aristocrat is in the careless and nonchalant way he wears the tuxedo and that cannot be imitated.All together a beautiful but cruel film on the egocentric selfishness of the super rich born super rich.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,Nothing has changed since Henry James,1380067200,"09 25, 2013",2013,5502,"['really', 'understand', 'film', 'novel', 'have', 'keep', 'mind',

248101,A106016KSI0YQ,6301247485,Jay Dickson,"[1, 2]","This adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel was one of the most hyped star vehicles of the 1970s: it features an all-star cast, with Mia Farrow as Daisy Buchanan, Bruce Dern as her husband Tom, Karen Black as Myrtle Wilson, and Robert Redford in the title role. The adaptation is almost as faithful as imaginable to the original's language as possible, with most of the dialogue actually lifted from the book; even so it misses pretty wide of the mark in terms of recapturing its spirit. Part of the problem is the casting. The film was hyped on its star power, and so long languorous shots are given of Robert Redford and Mia Farrow (always in soft focus) snuggling on a lawn with swans in the water before them, or dancing by candlelight in Gatsby's empty mansion; the two don't have that much chemistry, however, and neither of them are flattered much by the camerawork. (Redford always looks profoundly dinky compared to his Nick Carraway, Sam Waterston, and Farrow's bob and kohl-rimmed eyes make her forehead look enormous.)Farrow might have seemed like a good idea for Daisy, given her marked ability to seem annoyingly artificial and insincere; but by this point in her career she was overacting quite a bit, and thus was more usually seen to her best advantage in horror films, where her screaming and mugging didn't seem quite so jarring. Karen Black also chews up the scenery something awful as Myrtle; while Redford seems more of a pretty blob than anything. And Bruce Dern doesn't seem at all like a wealthy Yale athlete. While Waterston and Lois Chiles provide a serviceable Nick Carraway and Jordan Baker, only Scott Wilson really makes a strong impression as Myrtle's tragic husband George. The director, Jack Clayton, and his cinematographer, Douglas Slocombe, seem to be as much in love with fine things as Gatsby is: they reserve the vaseline filters and loving close-ups for the silver services and fine London shirts as much as they do for Redford's and Farrow's faces. Though the costumes by Theoni V. Aldredge and the music by Nelson Riddle both won Academy Aards, they both seem hugely misjudged: even Aldredge's casual outfits for Jordan Baker and Daisy Buchanan are ridiculously over-the-top (because Farrow was pregnant during the filming, she's also swathed in batwing sleeves and flowing scarves and capes), while Riddle provides annoying musical stings every time the camera zooms in on Daisy's anguished face or those heavyhandedly symbolic eyeglasses of Dr. T. J. Eckleburg. There are a few very pleasurable moments, such as a nice interior shot of Gatsby's mansion when his party guests pour in during a sudden rainstorm; and of course it's always a pleasure to hear Fitzgerald's dialogue.

248103,A35H40VPX2W2SB,6301247485,Jen,"[1, 2]","I have to start out by saying that I am very torn over what to rate this film. I want to like it, I really do, but I just can't seem to find all that much to like about the film. The sets/scenes and costumes were phenomenal, but I can't give a good rating based on that. I feel the major flaw in this movie was not the acting or casting (though I definitely have to comment on that later), it was the adaptation. I had already read the book a while ago, and it remains my favorite. However, for a school project we had to compare listening to a book on tape, to reading the book, so I chose The Great Gatsby. Having the words freshly in my mind, I also decided to try experiencing the story in the film medium. I've heard people praise the film for how close it was to the book, but I couldn't disagree more. Sure, it has the same gist to it, but everything is out of place. Dialogue is spoken in scenes far from where it was written, and many scene, especially in the beginning, were left out, which made me wonder how much a viewer who hasn't read the book could understand.Now for the acting and casting reviews. First off, what were they thinking casting Bruce Dern as Tom?! I simply don't care if he acted the part well. It's just not right to stray that far from the author's obvious depiction of a character. He's a brute, upper-class polo player; not some sleazy used car salesman! I cringed when I first saw Dern as Tom. However, he did fine acting, so I have nothing against the actor, just the casting director. Next, the inevitable review of Mia Farrow's Dasiy. I have to quote my father on this one... ""You look at Redford, and look at Farrow, and just think, nah... It wouldn't happen."" And I have to agree. There's no way Gatsby would have spent years pining after her, or the flat, shrill character she played Daisy as. Karen Black as Myrtle was fine I thought, though she varied from who I had pictured when I read the book, but that's a strictly personal thing. Whoever it was that played Jordan, I can't seem to find her name, did a wonderful job. She was definitely not who I pictured in the role, but never the less she did well. I loved Redford as Gatsby, but who didn't. Last but not least, Sam Waterston or Waterston (which is it, could someone tell me, even the credits in the movie vary... it's Waterston it the beginning, Waterson in the end) was wonderful, delightful, and PERFECT as Nick Carraway. He was right on the money!Lastly, I just have to throw in my comments about various symbols in the movie. Was it just me, or did the light at the end of Daisy's dock seem, well, just not as impressive as it did in the book. Maybe that's why it was shown so many darned times. Also, what on Earth was the director thinking with the sign of T.J. Eckleburg being shown so many times. You hear of it ONCE in the book, and I really don't get what he was going for with the eyes.

248105,A2ZWTFZRNQW7D5,6301247485,Jeremy Storly,"[1, 3]","I wish that I could say this movie is a worthy attempt at adapting a great American novel to screen. I wish I could say this, but I can't say this any more than Daisy could say she never loved Tom. If there is one statement that can honestly be made, it is that _The Great Gatsby_ could have been great. In the hands of a different director, this could have been worthwhile.The director must undoubtedly take the brunt of the blame for this flop, but even the actors must take some responsibility for their involvement in this flat and lifeless bore of a film.  Mia Farrow proves that ""shallow character"" and ""shallow actor"" are not synonymous; again, maybe it is the director's fault, but even though we can't fully sympathize with Daisy in the novel, I doubt Fitzgerald intended her to be as completely abrasive and unlikeable as she is portrayed in this adaptation. Sam Waterston's performance as Nick is passable, but whenever he appears on the screen, he seems less like Nick and more like a talented actor vexed to be trapped in this disaster of a film; furthermore, he already looks like a middle-aged man rather than a young man seeking his fortune. Even Robert Redford vogues for the camera and hopes his persona will eclipse his lack of direction and motivation. It doesn't; he obviously just doesn't care. Especially horrible is Bruce Dern in his role as Tom Buchanan. He reads his lines hollowly and dispassionately and seems totally oblivious to the fact that he has successfully converted memorable prose into passionless drivel.Besides the horrible direction and painful acting, the movie itself is forty minutes longer than it need be. The delivery of the dialogue feels like one awkward pause. The director inserts several scenes that work well in the novel but are superfluous in the film. Had they been well-executed, these scenes would still have felt forced, but as it is, these scenes give the feel of watching a high-school production of a novel the students fail to appreciate, much less understand. The best example of this is the weirdly interpreted scene showing a minor character, Michaelis, after the death of Myrtle pleading with Wilson to tell him the name of a church. In other places, characters and scenes that would have played out well onscreen, such as the drunken Owl Eyes sobering up in Gatsby's library, are sadly absent. How could any self-respecting director fail to see the comedic potential and significance of such a scene while wasting our time with the ten-minute marathon in Wilson's garage, or the ridiculous dance sequence between Gatsby and Daisy?Well, at least the soundtrack redeems this film, right? After all, Nelson Riddle's score won the Academy Award for Best Music. Well, what I hear is no award-winning score, but generic rubbish. In fact, it is partly the soundtrack that makes this such a chore to watch. With the right music, even a really bad movie can still be entertaining, or at least watchable. The same motif (""What'll I Do?"") is crucified within the 144 minutes this film will steal from your life. After seeing this film, every time you hear ""What'll I Do?"", you will throw up a little in your mouth.The positives? The costumes look nice and the sets are extremely attractive, which only drives home the sad point that, alas, in the hands of another director and a better cast, this movie could have been good. Even scriptwriter Francis Ford Coppola practically disowned this mess. As he said of the results, ""The script that I wrote did not get made.""

248106,A2G0FM58VHZ0CU,6301247485,Jill Morris,"[1, 1]","Having just seen this film again after many years---I doubt I was mature enough to fully appreciate it earlier---I happily agree with Grammar Girl's excellent comments which mainly speak my own current take.I thought Coppola's screenplay---even the version that got made-- was faithful to Fitzgerald's work: it was nuanced, dense with insights and the potential for the portrayal of complex feelings if rendered properly by the cast, which it was.  It captured the essence of the tragedy of people who have serious money and nothing else... certainly not depth, real intelligence, the curiosity that marks it... or character.  This, unfortunately, is a contingency which knows no circa; The Lost Generation lives, perhaps now, more even than once, given the increasing disparity of wealth.  The Hamptons---once cheap land comprising potato farms---house the current incarnation of the halcyon days of The North Shore of LI.....but are surely marked by no less excess and decadence.Fact is, Coppola, who replaced Truman Capote, who originally hired to do the screenplay (Vladimir Nabokov and Philip Roth were called in to make changes toward the end), said bitterly, the script he wrote did not get made. Boy, would I like to see the untampered with original!Mia Farrow (pregnant during the shoot), whom I generally find puerile, ersatz and cloying, manifested all of those qualities in her performance, and all were, at least this time, indigenous to the character she played, and so, for once, appropriate.  Daisy was a high maintenance-defining, incredibly fragile, and you bet, shallow, boring, patinated female who could do nothing even mundane for herself.  She was abysmally atrophied and infantile---not at all the same as elegant, to be sure.  Her husband, Tom Buchanan, was an ignorant, bigoted, ignoble boor.  They were perfectly matched.I think Redford was well cast and formidable as Jay Gatsby, a pitiably self deluded romantic of the sort only somebody scarred by early poverty and so, obliterating yearnings and truncation.  A pitiably driven man with exceptional, unrealized potential relegated blindly to trying to aspire to the tenets of a milieu of abject poverty....albeit not a poverty of dead Presidents.  He didn't love Daisy he was incapable of knowing Daisy.  He was tragically obsessed by what she represented in the face of his early deprivation.  His inability to connect to what and who she really was, was his undoing.  Very Greek tragedy, very neo Shakespearean, what's not to love?A magnificently cast Sam Waterston, then 34, conveyed more, as he continued to do and still does, via his face and demeanor than, I am convinced, any other actor could.For me, all the casting choices, performances and direction were spot on.  Also, the choice of locales involving properties in many states.While Theoni Aldredge won an Oscar for her costume design for the women, for me, her work was over the top and excessive caricature.  Flappers, even the most sybaritic among them, did not mostly wear vivid sherbet colors and cotton candy garden dresses, they wore dropped waists,  neutral colors, wineglass heels and often, tiered skirted dresses.  And so, for me, the women's' costumes were seriously distracting, not augmenting. Including even, Ms. Farrow's main wig, which should have been a style closer to the head and with the classic Marcel waves of the era.  I also thought the men's costumes via Ralph Lauren (`POLO' not exactly an arbitrarily chosen brand name) ---not unlike Jay Gatsby (read, Gatz,) himself---failed shamefully.  The suits he designed for the film were wince-making New Money Ralph Lauren of the 70s....hardly faithful to what the monied male demographic of 1922 wore:cuffed trousers,mostly vested suits with high waisted jackets and narrow lapels; ties narrower than what Mr. Lauren designed for the film.  And the men at Gatsby's parties were shown wearing already then out of fashion tail coats, not the short tuxedo jackets men of the era chose. I will say, Mr. Lauren mostly got the sweaters right. At the time, at least none of it was made in sweat shops in China as all his stuff is now.Another nit-picking beef of mine centers on Daisy's giant engagement ring.  Huge might be appropriate, but Cartier, the source of the Bling, supplied a giant Marquise cut engagement ring, one must assume, at the request of Ms. Aldridge.  Would Daisy have chosen or accepted such in 1922? Would Rachel Zoe now?(lol) Marquise cuts are usually made to maximize final size and to circumvent serious flaws in a Less Than,inferior rough, after all.  Every small part of a work impacts.But I too encourage everyone to see this generally splendid production of a great American novel written by a humanly imperfect genius.  And I'll be most interested in seeing the upcoming production staring Leonardo DiCaprio.",4,Splendid Production with Technical Flaws,1328918400,"02 11, 2012",2012,4846,"['Having', 'just', 'seen',

I saw it twice in school, and the reaction was always mixed. We are living in careless times and perhaps The Great Gatsby speaks more to us today than ever.  The 1920s were a fascinating era, and this film (and the book) captures it with haunting grandeur and beauty. The music - so wonderfully scored by Nelson Riddle - is a highlight.  Also a highlight is Mia Farrow's performance as Daisy....  Here's where the controversy always lies.  Why is Daisy portrayed as so stupid and shallow by Mia Farrow?  Why is her character so one dimensional?? Duh, that is the whole point of the story!  Daisy was the flawed character - she had no real vulnerability because she never loved anyone. She only cared about herself and her money and her ""white"" cars and clothes.  Gatsby was the ideal character - hopelessly in love with her. However, Redford's portrayal is not convincing at all. He didn't seem like he cared, either. Stiff as cardboard, no emotion, etc..  The tragedy of Gatsby was he was really a dreamer alone in the world.

248119,A271A5QEB090J5,6301247485,Kevin Kartchner,"[9, 11]","I won't reiterate what other reviewers have said in general about this picture; however, I feel compelled to write a few impressions.  I watched the movie shortly after reading Fitzgerald's novel for the first time, and, like others, was generally disappointed in the adaptation, notwithstanding its being almost completely faithful to the storyline of the book.1. I was confused about the film's score's winning the Academy Award in 1974, since much of the DVD's score sounds like the left-over soundtrack of an old ""Marcus Welby, MD"" episode.  Based on some of the reviews here, however, it appears that the original Nelson Riddle score was replaced, possibly due to concerns about royalties or other intellectual-property issues.2. Some of the casting can only be explained in the context of 1970s cinema, as it makes little sense now.  In 1974, Robert Redford was considered the quintessential dashing leading man, and Bruce Dern had a long history of playing the heavy, although usually in westerns.  I think someone must have seen something ""period"" in Mia Farrow, although I suspect that ""something"" tends to escape most viewers nowadays, in part because she looked too old for the role in 1974.  However, I agree with some reviewers that Sam Waterston as Nick, Scott Wilson as Wilson, and Lois Chiles as Jordan Baker, were inspired choices, and are rightly regarded as such even today.  Reasonable people may disagree, but I personally consider Karen Black as a great choice for Myrtle, but for a slight problem with her acting (see my next comment).3. The biggest problem with the film is not the casting, per se, but rather the ACTING, for which I blame the director more than the actors themselves.  Given that Tom Buchanan is supposed to be from the midwest, one can forgive Bruce Dern for sounding and acting a little hick-ish, but I can't forget the fact that I'm watching Dern PLAYING Tom.  Farrow's performance as Daisy is also unconvincing; her simpering, cloying manner is enough to make me wonder (a) why someone doesn't break HER nose, and (b) why Gatsby doesn't simply say, upon making her re-acquaintance, ""Oh, NOW I remember how you were--never mind the whole thing!""  Black's performance as Myrtle is too over-the-top--she well LOOKS the part, but she comes off as too unbalanced to attract anyone of Tom's economic stature.4. The cinematography and editing leave a lot to be desired, as well.  The film simply has too much of a made-for-TV look and feel (and, mind you, a 1970s made-for-TV look and feel), which is only aggravated by the new-for-video score.5. Notwithstanding all my criticisms, the costumes, sets, and art direction are sometimes stunning.  One good example is the ash-heap location of Wilson's garage and the all-seeing ""Dr. Eckleburg"" sign--as I read the book, I had trouble picturing the locale in my mind, but the film nails it.  Another image that the film gets right is the ""green light across the bay"" and everything that it symbolizes.  Finally, as one reviewer said, perhaps the West/East Egg mansions in the film look more Newport than ""Lawn Guyland""; however, they do much to evoke the opulence and ""carelessness"" (i.e., the amorality and sense of privilege of the old-money rich) that Fitzgerald wished to convey in the novel.It all adds up to a fairly mediocre film, but it still has its little charms.

248123,A3UJUVPDP4XF3B,6301247485,"Lesley M. Schultz ""msthoth""","[5, 5]","Mia Farrow gets slammed a lot for sinking this film, but I don't think the criticism is deserved.  Her Daisy is charming, flighty, playful, irresponsible and probably a little stupid.  But she epitomizes the upper class that Gatsby is so desperately trying to fit into, which display all these features.  ""The best thing a girl can be in this world, "" Daisy philosophizes to Nick, ""is a beautiful little fool.""  Lovely to look at, charming to be around but undemanding and demanding nothing. Everything must be given to her, for by herself she is worth nothing.  Daisy is an ornament, and very little more.  Mia Farrow plays her that way. Gatsby does not love her because he is enchanted by her character or admires her mind....he is obsessed with her because she represents a prize for which he can never really compete.  For upper class men, the woman one marries is of vital importance because she completes the ""set"" of things you must have in order to play the upper class ""game.""  Gatsby knows that, and he knows that Daisy would secure his entrance into the ""game"" because she has the look, the attitude, the very *smell* and *sound* of money. She was born to it and bred with it surrounding her all the time.  Moreover, she has all the right physical qualities: beautiful, charming, and not too bright. I think where Redford makes a mistake is in trying to play Gatsby as a man who loves Daisy for the person she is rather than the class she represents.  Bruce Dern is almost perfect as Daisy's husband Tom.  Tom is completely secure in the knowledge that money can buy literally anything, and he has more than enough to get him everything he could ever want. Money will solve all of his problems for him, because money is the one thing that hardly anyone ever has quite enough of.  And many, many people don't have enough to buy what they need to survive.  This gives an enormous amount of power to someone who has more than he will ever need or, for that matter, more than he would want.  He says at the end that he and Daisy have had times together that Gatsby could never understand, and he's right.  Daisy knows her place and her role, and Tom is both happy and grateful that she can fulfill and play both so well; the times together he refers to are when they are playing their stereotypical roles together perfectly, artlessly and without any thought-- the product of a lifetime of training and practice. Jay Gatsby does not understand either the upper class ""game,"" or the ""roles"" nor have any inkling of its final ""goal.""  In the end, this is because he is at heart a decent human being and cannot be anything else.  To be so rich that you need be held responsible for nothing is almost identical to absolute power corrupting absolutely, for it boils down to the same thing.  Gatsby pays the price; rich people never pay.  Sam Waterston is an excellent Nick Carroway.  The rest of the supporting cast also is outstanding.  And of course the music is wonderful, the sets are fabulous and the art direction first-rate.",3,"Not a Bad Effort....Not Perfect, but Passable",1011916800,"01 25, 2002",2002,3033,"['Mia', 'Farrow', 'slammed', 'lot', 'sinking', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'criticism', 'deserved', 'Daisy', 'charming', 'flighty', 'playful', 'irresponsible', 'probably', 'little', 'stupid', 'upper', 'class', 'Gatsby', 'so', 'desperately', 'trying', 'fit', 'display', 'features', 'best', 'thing', 'girl', 'can', 'be', 'world', 'Daisy', 'Nick', 'beautiful', 'little', 'fool', 'Lovely', 'look', 'charming', 'be', 'around', 'undemanding', 'demanding', 'nothing', 'Everything', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'herself', 'worth', 'nothing', 'Daisy', 'ornament', 'very', 'little', 'more', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'way', 'Gatsby', 'not', 'love', 'enchanted', 'character', 'mind', '.he', 'obsessed', 'prize', 'can', 'never', 'really', 'compete', 'upper', 'class', 'men', 'woman', 'one', 'marries', 'vital', 'importance', 'set', 'things', 'must', 'have', 'order', 'play', 'upper', 'class', 'game', 'Gatsby', 'Daisy', 'would', 'secure', 'entrance', 'game', 'look', 'attitude', 'very', '*smell*', '*sound*', 'money', 'was', 'born', 'bred', 'surrounding', 'time', 'Moreover', 'right', 'physical', 'qualities', 'beautiful', 'charming', 'not', 'too', 'bright', 'think', 'where', 'Redford', 'mistake', 'trying', 'play', 'Gatsby', 'man', 'who', 'Daisy', 'person', 'rather', 'class', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'almost', 'perfect', 'Daisy', 'husband', 'Tom', 'Tom', 'completely', 'secure', 'knowledge', 'money', 'can', 'buy', 'literally', 'anything', 'more', 'enough', 'get', 'everything', 'could', 'ever', 'want', 'Money', 'will', 'solve', 'problems', 'money', 'one', 'thing', 'hardly', 'anyone', 'ever', 'quite', 'enough', 'many', 'many', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'buy', 'what', 'need', 'survive', 'enormous', 'amount', 'power', 'someone', 'who', 'more', 'will', 'ever', 'need', 'matter', 'more', 'would', 'want', 'end', 'Daisy', 'have', 'had', 'times', 'together', 'Gatsby', 'could', 'never', 'understand', 'right', 'Daisy', 'place', 'role', 'Tom', 'happy', 'grateful', 'can', 'fulfill', 'play', 'so', 'well', 'times', 'together', 'are', 'when', 'are', 'playing', 'stereotypical', 'roles', 'together', 'perfectly', 'artlessly', 'thought', 'product', 'lifetime', 'training', 'practice', 'Jay', 'Gatsby', 'not', 'understand', 'either', 'upper', 'class', 'game', 'roles', 'have', 'inkling', 'final', 'goal', 'end', 'heart', 'decent', 'human', 'being', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'anything', 'else', 'be', 'so', 'rich', 'need', 'be', 'held', 'responsible', 'nothing', 'almost', 'identical', 'absolute', 'power', 'corrupting', 'absolutely', 'down', 'same', 'thing', 'Gatsby', 'price', 'rich', 'people', 'never', 'pay', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'excellent', 'Nick', 'Carroway', 'rest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'outstanding', 'course', 'music', 'wonderful', 'sets', 'are', 'fabulous', 'art', 'direction', 'first-rate']",N/A

Jay Gatsby is the kind of man that a girl would dream of. He's handsome, charming, smooth, and deep. Nick Carraway is the one that knows and sees everything and doesn't tell a soul. Daisy is the object of Gatsby's desire. His one true love that he never gave up on.

248134,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,6301247485,Martin Asiner,"[3, 4]","Whenever a classic novel is put to film, there is a tendency for the reader to place the words on the page to the action on the screen.  In THE GREAT GATSBY, director Jack Clayton had the uneviable task of transferring a novel that relied heavily on cultural theme and overt symbolism to a medium that required cinematographic sleight of hand to simulate Fitzgerald's symbols that channeled a post war Depression age fascination with the Great American Dream that somehow went very wrong following the stock market crash in 1929.  To this post war America that tasted the delights inherent in fulfilling the Dream, THE GREAT GATSBY slowly began to resonate with a reading public that saw that the vulgar displays of wealth in a typical Gatsby party were but the prescursors of the tragic loss of that wealth.  As I watched the movie unfold, I could see that the filmed version did not try to catch the more subtle psychological nuances of the book.  Rather, director Clayton focused the audience's attention on what could be seen and heard.  THE GREAT GATSBY is a two hour plus ensemble of sight and sound that very nearly catches the quick of the jazz age of the twenties.  Most of the first half is full of jitterbugging dancers and clangorous music that is so full of life that I barely noticed that the tunes belonged to a different age.  Amidst this panorama of dance, song, flapper style clothes, and Model T cars, lies the essential business of the book.  Robert Redford as Gatsby exactly details a man who could conquer the world of crime with an unerring eye for detail but must fail in judging the reality of a woman right in front of his eyes.  Mia Farrow as Daisy has been unfairly pilloried for being too whiny and too bony to cause a man to remake a world in his own image merely to win her.  But her seeming lack of beauty is exactly the point.  Had Gatsby been perceptive enough to see Daisy as she really was, then he would not have tried to alter a present to bring a past into his concept of a future.  For reasons of his own, Gatsby chooses to make Daisy the center of his universe, and in so doing unknowingly transforms the accepted American Dream of hard work leading to riches to one in which that very hard work can lead only to pain and loss.  Had a more voluptuous actress played Daisy, then Gatsby's reaching for her would have him stand for nothing but himself.  In reaching for Mia Farrow-Daisy, Gatsby reaches beyond her for the ideal of desire that rang so true in the novel.Further complicating director Clayton's task was Fitzgerald's use of a narrator-participant to filter the action to the reader.  Sam Waterston as Nick is terrific as the starry-eyed bond trader who is the only character to learn from the character faults of everyone around him, including Gatsby, whom he labels as 'worth more than the whole damn bunch of them.' In both book and film, Nick is passive but alert.  He sees as clearly as do the eyes of Dr. T. J. Eckleburg, who presides god-like over the valley of ashes that Gatsby calls home.  Bruce Dern as Tom, Daisy's brute husband does a convincing performance despite his lacking the bulkiness that bothers so many critics of the movie.  Dern has made a career of playing psychos and creeps, so he is perfectly cast as the thuggish Tom.  Karen Black as Myrtle steals the show as Tom's mistress, a woman who is ultimately seen as more unhappily flawed than any other character.THE GREAT GATSBY is a treat for the eye and ear, even if not for a mind that comes to the screen with many of Fitzgerald's memorable quotes lingering on the lips.  What emerges at the end is a flashing green light that signifies to both Nick and the viewer that any vision that is worth having must not be degraded by sharing it with another who may have a competing and mutually exclusive dream of her own.  Tragically, for every Gatsby there are dozens of Daisys.",4,The Near Great Gatsby,1039824000,"12 14, 2002",2002,3903,"['Whenever', 'classic', 'novel', 'put', 'film', 'tendency', 'reader', 'place', 'words', 'page', 'action', 'screen', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'GATSBY', 'director', 'Jack', 'Clayton', 'had', 'uneviable', 'task', 'transferring', 'novel', 'relied', 'heavily', 'cultural', 'theme', 'overt', 'symbolism', 'medium', 'required', 'cinematographic', 'sleight', 'hand', 'simulate', 'Fitzgerald', 'symbols', 'channeled', 'post', 'war', 'Depression', 'age', 'fascination', 'Great', 'American', 'Dream', 'somehow', 'went', 'very', 'wrong', 'following', 'stock', 'market', 'crash', '1929', 'post', 'war', 'America', 'tasted', 'delights', 'inherent', 'fulfilling', 'Dream', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'GATSBY', 'slowly', 'began', 'resonate', 'reading', 'public', 'saw', 'vulgar', 'displays', 'wealth', 'typical', 'Gatsby', 'party', 'were', 'prescursors', 'tragic', 'loss', 'wealth', 'watched', 'movie', 'unfold', 'could', 'see', 'filmed', 'version', 'did', 'not', 'try', 'catch', 'more', 'subtle', 'psychological', 'nuances', 'book', 'Rather', 'director', 'Clayton', 'focused', 'audience', 'attention', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'heard', 'GREAT', 'GATSBY', 'two', 'hour', 'ensemble', 'sight', 'sound', 'very', 'nearly', 'quick', 'jazz', 'age', 'twenties', 'Most', 'first', 'half', 'full', 'jitterbugging', 'dancers', 'clangorous', 'music', 'so', 'full', 'life', 'barely', 'noticed', 'tunes', 'belonged', 'different', 'age', 'Amidst', 'panorama', 'dance', 'song', 'flapper', 'style', 'clothes', 'Model', 'T', 'cars', 'essential', 'business', 'book', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Gatsby', 'exactly', 'details', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'conquer', 'world', 'crime', 'unerring', 'eye', 'detail', 'must', 'fail', 'judging', 'reality', 'woman', 'right', 'front', 'eyes', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'Daisy', 'been', 'unfairly', 'pilloried', 'being', 'too', 'whiny', 'too', 'bony', 'cause', 'man', 'remake', 'world', 'own', 'image', 'merely', 'win', 'seeming', 'lack', 'beauty', 'exactly', 'point', 'Had', 'Gatsby', 'been', 'perceptive', 'enough', 'see', 'Daisy', 'really', 'was', 'then', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'tried', 'alter', 'present', 'bring', 'past', 'concept', 'future', 'reasons', 'own', 'Gatsby', 'make', 'Daisy', 'center', 'universe', 'so', 'doing', 'unknowingly', 'accepted', 'American', 'Dream', 'hard', 'work', 'leading', 'riches', 'one', 'very', 'hard', 'work', 'can', 'lead', 'only', 'pain', 'loss', 'Had', 'more', 'voluptuous', 'actress', 'played', 'Daisy', 'then', 'Gatsby', 'reaching', 'would', 'have', 'stand', 'nothing', 'reaching', 'Mia', 'Farrow-Daisy', 'Gatsby', 'ideal', 'desire', 'so', 'true', 'novel.Further', 'complicating', 'director', 'Clayton', 'task', 'was', 'Fitzgerald', 'use', 'narrator-participant', 'filter', 'action', 'reader', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'Nick', 'terrific', 'starry-eyed', 'bond', 'trader', 'who', 'only', 'character', 'learn', 'character', 'faults', 'everyone', 'including', 'Gatsby', 'whom', ""'worth"", 'more', 'whole', 'damn', 'bunch', 'book', 'film', 'Nick', 'passive', 'alert', 'as', 'clearly', 'do', 'eyes', 'Dr.', 'T.', 'J.', 'Eckleburg', 'who', 'god-like', 'valley', 'ashes', 'Gatsby', 'home', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'Tom', 'Daisy', 'brute', 'husband', 'convincing', 'performance', 'lacking', 'bulkiness', 'bothers', 'so', 'many', 'critics', 'movie', 'Dern', 'made', 'career', 'playing', 'psychos', 'creeps', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'thuggish', 'Tom', 'Karen', 'Black', 'Myrtle', 'show', 'Tom', 'mistress', 'woman', 'who', 'ultimately', 'seen', 'more', 'unhappily', 'flawed', 'other', 'character.THE', 'GREAT', 'GATSBY', 'treat', 'eye', 'ear', 'even', 'not', 'mind', 'screen', 'many', 'Fitzgerald', 'memorable', 'quotes', 'lingering', 'lips', 'What', 'end', 'flashing', 'green', 'light', 'Nick', 'viewer', 'vision', 'worth', 'having', 'must', 'not', 'be', 'degraded', 'sharing', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'competing', 'mutually', 'exclusive', 'dream', 'own', 'Tragically', 'Gatsby', 'are', 'dozens', 'Daisys']",N/A

Lebow,"[1, 8]","The book upon which this DVD was based has come back into the limelight in the post-Enron, post-Tyco, post-Refco, post-Worldcom, post-Adelphia world of ethicless business. The DVD gets this part of the book right. Like the major rich characters in this DVD, today's ruthless robber-barons, cheat on their wives, demean their employees, spend money lavishly on conspicuous consumption. But Gatsby never gave a million dollar party like the head of Tyco did.So much is similar: no one knows where the rich people's money is coming from. Everyone assumes there is something illegal about a few people having all the money and the poor people being pushed further into poverty. But, no one seems to be doing anything about it.When General Motors steps away from its commitment to employee pensions, and United Airlines, and IBM, this book becomes more and more contemporary. Even more so when executive pay rises in the double digits every year. Tom Buchannan, the adulterer in this classic, would fit right into today's business elite.Gatsby (Robert Redford) himself is mysterious, but, although his background in the First World War is revealed in the book, it is not found in the film. His background turns out to be similar to many veterans who returned from Vietnam, or Iraq, to find that the rules of business had changed, and for the most part, there was no effective enforcement.The real lesson of this DVD is that the wages of sin is death. Gatsby dies in a case of mistaken identity. His death is triggered by Buchannan's infidelity. This is a message America needs to see.I watched this film when it came out. But that was before Enron. I rented the VHS and watched again after the Internet bubble burst, just like the stock market imploded in 1929, shortly after the book was written, sweeping millions into poverty.By the time the book became popular, thousands of people who had hoped to be like Gatsby were living on the streets.

248150,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,6301247485,M. Oleson,"[6, 6]","With a new Baz Luhrmann Gatzby film upon us, I thought it would be interesting to take a look and this 1974 version.  By my count this is the 4th adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel including a ""lost"" silent version.  Francis Ford Coppola handled the screenplay and stays pretty true to the book.  Maybe too much so.  It's not the dialog so much that is wrong, it's the long silences between exchanges.  At times I felt like I was watching a daytime soap opera.Mia Farrow is miscast in the critical role of Daisy Buchanan, the waifish heiress who marries the brutish Tom (Bruce Dern), himself of old money.  Jay Gatsby (Robert Redford) is the mysterious millionaire on the other side of Long Island, living ""across the yard"" from Nick Carraway, the film's narrator and Daisy's second cousin ""once removed.""  Nicely played by Sam Waterson, Nick seems to love Daisy as much as Jay or certainly Tom.The source of Gatsby's fortune is never clear but the implication is that it came from a series of illegal activities, likely to include bootlegging.  Set in the post WW I early twenties, Gatsby's not very sociable but does spring for daily parties at his opulent house.  Jay and Nick strike up a friendship which allows a reunion between Jay and Daisy who were romantically involved for a short period, prior to Jay shipping off to war.Other characters become critical to the story.  Scott Wilson from TV's ""The Walking Dead"" is very good as George Wilson a garage owner whose wife, Myrtle (Karen Black) is having a not-so-secret affair with Tom.  Daisy's best friend, golfer Jordan Baker is played by yummy Lois Chiles.  She's in many of the scenes but the filmmakers give her little to do but just look good.The production values of the film are excellent and produced a couple Oscars (costume design, music scoring).  Everyone dresses ""to the nines"" throughout the film.  Often dressing in white and even Redford in a pink 3-piece suit, the film looks great, especially in this Blu ray offering.  The Blu ray brings out some great detail but also shows some flaws.  Set during a summer heat wave, the characters are often dripping with facial sweat, but there is not a hint of perspiration around the collars.  In one scene Redford is wearing a white cable knit sweater.  Yikes!  The film is great to look at, but director Jack Clayton's glacial pacing is hard to take.  It might have been different had there been any chemistry between Redford and Farrow.  Had Gatsby gone after Chiles' character, now that would have been a better match.The new Blu Ray edition is a significant step up from the dull DVD.  The transfer has an AVC encoded 1080p resolution with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The movie looks very film-like with goodly amounts of grain and with sharp detail.  There are many close-ups used in the film and the skin coloring looked perfect to me.  I can't fault the video transfer.  Likewise the audio has been upgraded to a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  The surrounds kick in when the music starts, which is often. There are several lengthy party scenes and this is where you'll get the full 5.1 experience.  Otherwise the dialog is properly focused up front.  There are no special features or extras.  None, zero, nada, zip.",3,BLU RAY displays a great looking movie,1367539200,"05 3, 2013",2013,3245,"['new', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'Gatzby', 'film', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'take', 'look', '1974', 'version', 'count', '4th', 'adaptation', 'F.', 'Scott', 'Fitzgerald', 'classic', 'novel', 'including', 'lost', 'silent', 'version', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'handled', 'screenplay', 'pretty', 'true', 'book', 'Maybe', 'too', 'much', 'so', 'not', 'dialog', 'so', 'much', 'wrong', 'long', 'silences', 'exchanges', 'times', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'daytime', 'soap', 'opera.Mia', 'Farrow', 'miscast', 'critical', 'role', 'Daisy', 'Buchanan', 'waifish', 'heiress', 'who', 'brutish', 'Tom', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'old', 'money', 'Jay', 'Gatsby', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'mysterious', 'millionaire', 'other', 'side', 'Long', 'Island', 'living', 'yard', 'Nick', 'Carraway', 'film', 'narrator', 'Daisy', 'second', 'cousin', 'once', 'removed', 'Nicely', 'played', 'Sam', 'Waterson', 'Nick', 'love', 'Daisy', 'as', 'much', 'Jay', 'certainly', 'Tom.The', 'source', 'Gatsby', 'fortune', 'never', 'clear', 'implication', 'came', 'series', 'illegal', 'activities', 'likely', 'include', 'bootlegging', 'Set', 'post', 'WW', 'early', 'twenties', 'Gatsby', 'not', 'very', 'sociable', 'spring', 'daily', 'parties', 'opulent', 'house', 'Jay', 'Nick', 'strike', 'up', 'friendship', 'reunion', 'Jay', 'Daisy', 'who', 'were', 'romantically', 'involved', 'short', 'period', 'prior', 'Jay', 'shipping', 'off', 'war.Other', 'characters', 'become', 'critical', 'story', 'Scott', 'Wilson', 'TV', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'very', 'good', 'George', 'Wilson', 'garage', 'owner', 'wife', 'Myrtle', 'Karen', 'Black', 'having', 'not-so-secret', 'affair', 'Tom', 'Daisy', 'best', 'friend', 'golfer', 'Jordan', 'Baker', 'played', 'yummy', 'Lois', 'Chiles', 'many', 'scenes', 'filmmakers', 'give', 'little', 'do', 'just', 'look', 'good.The', 'production', 'values', 'film', 'are', 'excellent', 'produced', 'couple', 'Oscars', 'costume', 'design', 'music', 'scoring', 'Everyone', 'nines', 'film', 'Often', 'dressing', 'white', 'even', 'Redford', 'pink', '3-piece', 'suit', 'film', 'great', 'especially', 'Blu', 'ray', 'offering', 'Blu', 'ray', 'out', 'great', 'detail', 'also', 'flaws', 'Set', 'summer', 'heat', 'wave', 'characters', 'are', 'often', 'dripping', 'facial', 'sweat', 'not', 'hint', 'perspiration', 'collars', 'one', 'scene', 'Redford', 'wearing', 'white', 'cable', 'knit', 'sweater', 'Yikes', 'film', 'great', 'look', 'director', 'Jack', 'Clayton', 'glacial', 'pacing', 'hard', 'take', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'had', 'been', 'chemistry', 'Redford', 'Farrow', 'Had', 'Gatsby', 'gone', 'Chiles', 'character', 'now', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'match.The', 'new', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'edition', 'significant', 'step', 'up', 'dull', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'AVC', 'encoded', '1080p', 'resolution', '1.78:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'movie', 'very', 'film-like', 'goodly', 'amounts', 'grain', 'sharp', 'detail', 'are', 'many', 'close-ups', 'used', 'film', 'skin', 'coloring', 'looked', 'perfect', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'video', 'transfer', 'Likewise', 'audio', 'been', 'upgraded', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'surrounds', 'kick', 'when', 'music', 'often', 'are', 'several', 'lengthy', 'party', 'scenes', 'where', ""'ll"", 'get', 'full', '5.1', 'experience', 'Otherwise', 'dialog', 'properly', 'focused', 'up', 'front', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'extras', 'None', 'zero', 'nada', 'zip']",N/A

It?s full of wanton greed, lust, sex and murder set during the flapper age. Robert Redford is the quintessential sexy, Jay Gatsby. He?s at once a charmer and a recluse, throwing lavish parties on his Long Island estate for the ritzy jet set, though rarely attending except in absentee through a bird?s eye view from his second story window. But Gatsby?s unassuming secretiveness is brought into the light when he meets gawky paramour, Daisy Buchanan (Mia Farrow). She?s a godless, flighty flapper, married to a wealthy playboy, Tom (Bruce Dern), and cousin to the introspective, Nick Carraway (Sam Waterston) the young man living on the cottage near Gatsby?s estate. Nick is genuine and Gatsby, sensing that he can trust Nick, confides in him his romantic interests in Daisy. The two become lovers ? a relationship which is genuine for Gatsby but shallow, fleeting and inconsequential to Daisy. She soon returns to Tom who decides to set Gatsby up with the accidental hit and run of Myrtle Wilson (Karen Black) that he has committed. Tom and Myrtle used to be an item and Tom?s impregnation is passed off as Gatsby?s, leaving Myrtle?s distraught husband, George (Scott Wilson) with murder on his mind.  Despite a screenplay by Francis Ford Coppola and stellar production values the film generally misses its mark in recanting the tale of a millionaire playboy, brooding away in his locked mansion for the woman that he lost. There's just something about Fitzgerald's writing that doesn't translate well to the big screen.The transfer is a huge, strange disappointment. Despite being anamorphically enhanced the picture elements look as though they've been fed through a meat grinder. Age related scratches and often excessive film grain crop up throughout, while some scenes are remarkably free of either distraction. The contrast levels during the dusk scenes are way too low. Colors are generally muted and during several scenes even bleed. There are digital artifacts throughout including more than a hint of edge enhancement, aliasing and shimmering of fine details. The audio is barely stereo and really weak in its spread.

Although some of the actors could have been better, I found the film to be faithful to the story and well directed.The film follows the classic story of Gatsby, a poor man who made a fortune after the Great War and so became the talk of the town. Although Gatsby's wealth could buy anything he wanted, what he really wanted was Daisy: a beautiful but shallow woman whom Gatsby can't get out of his mind.  Daisy is now married and lives across from Gatsby's home.  Gatsby's lavish home and parties are little more than Gatsby's subconscious wooing of Daisy.  But Gatsby was never born in wealth and so wasn't considered 'polite' enough to be with someone like Daisy (Mia Farrow.) This was certainly the opinion of her brute husband (Bruce Dern)who needs to get his jollies on the poor side of town.

Scott Fitzgerald was a brilliant novelist and short story writer, but an abysmal screen-writer when he was in Hollywood.  Fitzgerald stuck to depressing realism.  Yet movies work on sympathetic characterizations.  The audience must like the characters.  The characters should evoke our empathy.Redford, Farrow, Dern were great at capturing the characters as written in the novel.  But they weren't compelling enough for a movie.  They didn't evoke empathy and were not likeable characters.  It works in a novel, but not on film.  Or to make it work on film, they needed additions to what the novel provided.Another great lack was a question of chemistry.  It is hard to conceive of Redford character (because on film that's what the character amounts to) laboring under a lost idealistic love for the Daisy portrayed by Mia Farrow.  The two ""film"" characters lacked believable chemistry and were pitifully boring together in their scenes.  Therefore, the writing of the film script should have surpassed the novel.  Maybe Faye Dunaway as Daisy would have been a better choice.  Dunaway is an actress capable of passion, superficiality and she is well capable of leaving us with a chill.  Whereas Farrow's Daisy came off as merely a loser in the marriage stakes, bored with her life and accepting Gatsby's adoration in desperateness to find an escape from her life.  Yes, true to the novel, but not enough to carry off the underlying points that Fitzgerald had conveyed in writing.  It wasn't only who Daisy was but also how life made her.

But, is this Mia's fault, or Scott Fitzgerald's ? After all, aren't ALL his heroines eminently slap-able ???The main problem with this video release is however, the deletion of most of Nelson Riddle's brilliant score. Riddle used Irving Berlin's song &quot;What'll I Do&quot; as his main theme and interpolated it (to great effect)throughout the movie. The movie was made long before the days of home video,DVD,etc. So, when Paramount wanted to release the movie on video, the Irving Berlin estate said &quot;Hang on a minute, we only licensed the song for theatrical release. Nobody said anything about a video release. If you want to use our song in your video, you have to pay us another zillion (I exagerate- but you get the idea!) dollars for the priviledge&quot;. Naturally, Paramount said &quot;No way !&quot;.That is why we have this bowdlerised video, and why we have no DVD, or CD release. Although in the latter case, there is the added complication of the soundtrack being released on the now defunct Paramount label.

It wasn't the greatest movie then, but it had an undeniable appeal in its stars, its sets and costumes, and above all, its music. Nelson Riddle assembled and orchestrated actual popular songs of the 1920's to provide the film with one of the lushest, most romantic scores ever. Imagine my disappointment when I saw this current video release and found that nearly the entire Riddle musical track from the movie has been replaced with music that I can only describe as 'TV-movie-of-the-week' quality. This beautiful, flawed movie had a haunting, elegiac quality with its original score. Now, it's just a flat, overproduced bore. Paramount has recently become an industry leader in its efforts to restore its classic films- they could do worse than to resolve whatever physical or legal problems are keeping Riddle's incredibly fine work off the soundtrack of this video. If you ever run across an old copy of the soundtrack album, pick it up and play it and you'll hear what I mean.

248186,A16J5IIA94TJOB,6301247485,Scott Dorn,"[0, 0]","Robert Horton's review for Amazon really annoys me! It is possible to have a visually stunning film that is compatible with F. Scott Fitzgerald's source material. In fact in this case, it's essential! These characters inhabit a fantasy world of their own making and the tragedies that follow are made even more jarring by their ""perfect on the surface"" look, much like being on the cover of  Harpers Bizarre.  Horton's description of the excessive use of ""flappers"" and jazz is all wrong. There is one relatively brief scene at a lavish party that shows some of the ""decadence"" of the rich of that era. But it's the characters blatant disregard for others combined with their perfect hair, perfect dress, and perfect manners that make their actions all the more unsettling! We still see this today.... is it really any more decadent than a huge bash given by the very elite now? Or the gaudy obscenity of a Kim Kardashian wedding?The story of Jay Gatsby, played by Robert Redford, is one of mystery, (Did he gain his wealth illegally?). He's a hopeless romantic in love with a shallow and amoral child/woman, Daisy Buchanan, played beautifully by Mia Farrow, whose love for Jay may or may not be real. But one thing is for certain, Daisy thinks ONLY about Daisy! Leaving others to clean up the mess she leaves behind.There is one scene in the film that defines Daisy's and Gatsby's relationship, and that's a scene in his immense dressing room where he tosses out dozens of expensive shirts, sweaters, and suits to impress her, and Daisy bursts into tears and says, ""I've never seen anything so beautiful""....we can gather from that scene that Daisy is thinking, ""Why didn't you have all of this when we first met?"", or is she just thinking about his wealth and nothing else? He might as well have been throwing money! It was never in her plans to marry a poor man regardless of how she felt about him!Karen Black and Bruce Dern make up the supporting cast and are extremely effective in their roles. Sam Waterston is perfect as Daisy's cousin, Nick Carroway, a bystander, moral critic, and narrator of the story. But Scott Wilson is really a stand out as a man driven to madness and revenge, but for the wrong person, Gatsby.This is a film that you need to see more than once to fully appreciate, I almost guarantee you that you'll see subtleties in the performances that you missed on first viewing. The dialogue is very eloquent and proves again why F, Scott Fitzgerald is so revered. Nelson Riddle does a terrific job in arranging a beautiful score reminiscent of the era and including Irving Berlin's, ""What'll I Do"" sung with heart breaking sincerity by William Atherton.

Scott Fitzgerald presents taut tension and symbolism between Modernism and Victorianism in the 1925's quintessential jazz age of the great American novel, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; and this 1974 adaptation of Fitzgerald's novel with Francis Ford Coppola's screenwriting captures the better part of it!Daisy's green light at the end of her dock that symbolizes all hope and want in not just Gatsby but all people, the &quot;haves&quot; and the &quot;have-nots&quot;, guilt and carelessness, living above judgement and consequences, and of course, the eyes of Dr. T.J.

I have always regarded it as thee single most overrated novel of the early twentieth century, even though my literature teachers provided me enough insight to understand that it was a metaphor for the emptiness of the post World War One generation, who grew extremely wealthy in the 1920s, but who were spiritually and morally bankrupt, having little more to fill their lives other than endless partying and outrageous behavior.  This 1974 movie version of Fitzgerald's novel is simply another vehicle for demonstrating how something of so little substance can be pumped up as a lavish production with even less substance, offering only the addition of Mia Farrow's awesome beauty, constantly enhanced by her translucent hat brim and superb make-up. Robert Redford is the wooden golden boy central figure, and it is the supporting cast that gives this weak story any depth at all, most particularly, Bruce Dern. I do intend, by the way, to see the 2013 DeCaprio version of this story, if only to see if this 21st century redux provides anything approaching real dimension at all.

Scott Fitzgerald.Francis Ford Coppola wrote the screenplay for this film and followed the classic book about as closely as a film is capable of doing. But I found the direction to be flawed somehow. The film is filled with starlit close-ups (no one's eyes sparkle like that, not even Daisy's) and smoke screen silhouettes, complex party scenes and plenty of flapper costumes. I just couldn't figure out why all of the strange lighting existed after hiring two nearly perfect looking actors, in Mia Farrow and Robert Redford. I would have preferred to see the stars in Daisy's eyes stem from a great acting performance rather than the eerie sparkles falsely placed in every close-up!Robert Redford was good as Gatsby and he conveyed some of the character's desperate and lonely love. I was disappointed that all of the complexity of Gatsby was never fully explained. If I would not have known the story beforehand I would have never understood what tied Gatsby and Daisy together, other than money of course. But Redford captures Gatsby's aloofness to a tee and one can easily see why Daisy would be in love with Gatsby.I found Mia Farrow to be disappointing as Daisy Buchanan, the spoiled debutante who manages to seduce the great Gatsby for a lifetime. As stated previously Farrow's close-ups were far too crafted to seduce anyone. She came across as a flirty silly girl more than a classic seductress and paled in comparison to Redford's portrayal of Gatsby. She looked cute in all of the frilly costumes of course, but I never really found her character believable.Karen Black is downright scary as the mistress of Mr. Buchanan, with her eyes crossing and spitting with every close-up. Bruce Dern plays the arrogant competitive Mr. Buchanan with great nastiness. Sam Waterston steals the show however with his portrayal as the narrator of the story. He captures innocence and compassion while keeping his open-eyed curiosity and faithfulness to Gatsby from beginning to end.Overall this film is good, if you have read the book first, but lacks a full explanation. The filmmakers relied more on scenery and lighting than perfect casting and a deeper meaning. Some scenes are magical while others fall flat. For Redford fans and lovers of the 20's it is a gem. The greed and power hungry people are captured but sadly the deepest desires of all that passion become lost behind the filmmakers vision.",3,Not Great But Sometimes Magical,1090886400,"07 27, 2004",2004,2536,"['movie', 'great', 'awful', 'depending', 'entirely', 'one', 'need', 'accuracy', 'how', 'deeply', 'may', 'have', 'felt', 'book', 'F.', 'Scott', 'Fitzgerald.Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'film', 'followed', 'classic', 'book', 'as', 'closely', 'film', 'capable', 'doing', 'found', 'direction', 'be', 'flawed', 'somehow', 'film', 'filled', 'starlit', 'close-ups', 'one', 'eyes', 'sparkle', 'not', 'even', 'Daisy', 'smoke', 'screen', 'silhouettes', 'complex', 'party', 'scenes', 'plenty', 'flapper', 'costumes', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'strange', 'lighting', 'existed', 'hiring', 'two', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'looking', 'actors', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'see', 'stars', 'Daisy', 'eyes', 'stem', 'great', 'acting', 'performance', 'rather', 'eerie', 'sparkles', 'falsely', 'placed', 'close-up', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'was', 'good', 'Gatsby', 'conveyed', 'character', 'desperate', 'lonely', 'love', 'was', 'disappointed', 'complexity', 'Gatsby', 'was', 'never', 'fully', 'explained', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'known', 'story', 'beforehand', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'understood', 'what', 'tied', 'Gatsby', 'Daisy', 'together', 'other', 'money', 'course', 'Redford', 'Gatsby', 'aloofness', 'tee', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'why', 'Daisy', 'would', 'be', 'love', 'Gatsby.I', 'found', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'be', 'disappointing', 'Daisy', 'Buchanan', 'spoiled', 'debutante', 'who', 'seduce', 'great', 'Gatsby', 'lifetime', 'stated', 'previously', 'Farrow', 'close-ups', 'were', 'far', 'too', 'crafted', 'seduce', 'anyone', 'came', 'across', 'flirty', 'silly', 'more', 'classic', 'seductress', 'paled', 'comparison', 'Redford', 'portrayal', 'Gatsby', 'looked', 'cute', 'frilly', 'costumes', 'course', 'never', 'really', 'found', 'character', 'believable.Karen', 'Black', 'downright', 'scary', 'mistress', 'Mr.', 'Buchanan', 'eyes', 'crossing', 'spitting', 'close-up', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'arrogant', 'competitive', 'Mr.', 'Buchanan', 'great', 'nastiness', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'show', 'however', 'portrayal', 'narrator', 'story', 'innocence', 'compassion', 'keeping', 'open-eyed', 'curiosity', 'faithfulness', 'Gatsby', 'beginning', 'end.Overall', 'film', 'good', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'first', 'full', 'explanation', 'filmmakers', 'relied', 'more', 'scenery', 'lighting', 'perfect', 'casting', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'scenes', 'are', 'magical', 'others', 'fall', 'flat', 'Redford', 'fans', 'lovers', '20', 'gem', 'greed', 'power', 'hungry', 'people', 'are', 'captured', 'sadly', 'deepest', 'desires', 'passion', 'become', 'lost', 'filmmakers', 'vision']",N/A

Risoli ""black farmer""","[0, 0]","There are numerous film versions of the book as we all know, but I must weigh in with my vote on the often questioned casting of Robert Redford and Mia Farrow in the 1974 Jack Clayton version.  Together, the couple make this, perhaps difficult to film, book work.  Francis Ford Coppola, who wrote this version's screenplay, also wrote a screenplay for the film version of Carson McCullers' ""Reflections in a Golden Eye"" that was shopped to the cast as the screenplay that was to be used, but the director, John Huston, had another author, less prolific, John Chapman Mortimer and his own associate, Gladys Hill do the final screenplay.  Coppola's script for ""The Great Gatsby,"" for which he deserves a lot of the credit for making the film a success, is excellent, showing Coppola to be the great cineaste that he has become.  Also very good in the 1974 production are the performances by Karen Black and even Scott Wilson, who seems to generally overact a lot, but in ""The Great Gatsby"" he is effective for his interaction.  Robert Redford is perfectly cast as ""Gatsby"" as is Mia Farrow as ""Daisy.""  It is almost unbelievable, knowing of their careers in Hollywood, that they could make the Fitzgerald book work so well.  If ""The Great Gatsby"" could be realized on film, then the 1974 Paramount version comes very close to doing it best.  The Blu-ray version is great, turning another chapter for this production, which was greatly publicized in 1974, especially for fashion, if you remember.
