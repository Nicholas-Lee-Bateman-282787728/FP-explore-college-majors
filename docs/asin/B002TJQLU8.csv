What a contrast in characters, which could only be done by a really skilled actor.  Judge Deed, contrary to a line in the official review is hardly creeping toward middle age.  He drives fast cards, fences and has a far too active sex life with too many women.  When he's not chasing after women in general and his former female protege, a lawyer, or trying to keep his college aged daughter out of trouble because like her father she has a penchant for justice, he's chasing after justice.  This always pits him against the powers that be his bosses, the government, and corrupt corporations.  There's alot of drama and thrills in each of the 90min. episodes.  I can guarantee you won't be bored!

Make that downright sexy for those of you who want a quietly sexy judge as well!  Part of what works so well is that he has a marvelous voice.  He rarely raises it and it is all the more effective for being on the quiet side.Yes, this is yet another law and order show but it is quite unusual as every case is primarily seen from his point of view.  Most of these shows revolve around the police instead.  Deed is a maverick, as many police people are similarly portrayed.  However, a judge must be a maverick in a much different way from that of a police person or a barrister.  He is much more insidious in his bucking of the system.  He is very committed to what he does so there is no question of his being ""gotten to.""  His personal life, while not sordid in any way, has a great deal of solitude and he is the ""stick in the mud"" to his daughter and father, also in the law.The cases themselves and the barristers who are the supporting characters are also quite good but it is Deed himself who solidly anchors the show.I highly recommend this show. Seasons 1-5 are the best.  By Season 6, they are running out of ideas of what to do with Deed and his on again off again girlfriend, Jo Mills.  They should have ended it with season 5.",5,Martin Shaw Is Wonderful as UK Judge,1276819200,"06 18, 2010",2010,1406,"['Martin', 'Shaw', 'not', 'only', 'excellent', 'job', 'playing', 'British', 'judge', 'conducting', 'usually', 'criminal', 'trials', 'also', 'across', 'very', 'appealing', 'middle', 'aged', 'man', 'Make', 'downright', 'sexy', 'who', 'want', 'quietly', 'sexy', 'judge', 'as', 'well', 'Part', 'what', 'so', 'well', 'marvelous', 'voice', 'rarely', 'more', 'effective', 'being', 'quiet', 'side.Yes', 'yet', 'law', 'order', 'show', 'quite', 'unusual', 'case', 'primarily', 'seen', 'point', 'view', 'Most', 'shows', 'revolve', 'police', 'instead', 'Deed', 'maverick', 'many', 'police', 'people', 'are', 'similarly', 'portrayed', 'However', 'judge', 'must', 'be', 'maverick', 'much', 'different', 'way', 'police', 'person', 'barrister', 'much', 'more', 'insidious', 'bucking', 'system', 'very', 'committed', 'what', 'so', 'question', 'being', 'gotten', 'personal', 'life', 'not', 'sordid', 'way', 'great', 'deal', 'solitude', 'stick', 'mud', 'daughter', 'father', 'also', 'law.The', 'cases', 'barristers', 'who', 'are', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'Deed', 'who', 'solidly', 'show.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'show', 'Seasons', '1-5', 'are', 'best', 'Season', '6', 'are', 'running', 'ideas', 'what', 'do', 'Deed', 'again', 'off', 'again', 'girlfriend', 'Jo', 'Mills', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'season', '5']",Judge John Deed : Pilot Episode + Complete Series 1 [NON-U.S.A.

Then too, one wishes that Deed could be less of a womanizer although this is apparently supposed to make him seem more of a regular guy.

I confess that GENTLY is my favorite, but I like the DEED series a great deal so far (through season three so far) .

1288408,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B002TJQLU8,David Bower,"[10, 13]","Although we are fans of Martin Shaw, the character of Judge John Deed is annoying in his rather juvenile preoccupation with sex. While the show has some interesting courtroom drama one gets the impression that any halfway attractive woman that comes close is going to get propositioned by the judge regardless of whether she's married or single.Judge Deed on one hand expressed a desire to find the truth and dispense justice from the bench while on the other exhibited a rather amazing disregard for the sanctity of marriage and seemed to see women as primarily sex objects. This was to me a rather jarring disconnect that interfered with my enjoyment of the story; when a pretty woman walked into the room one began to fear for her safety with the judge around.I found Deed's daughter to be an annoying character to whom the end justified the means; she seemed to be constantly getting into trouble because of her actions and associations and then calling on daddy to use his position and influence to get her out of trouble. His repeated indulgence of his daughter helps explain how she became what she was.All told I found the series had too much internal contradiction to be watchable; while claiming the moral high ground on the bench he, at the same time, plumbed the depths of moral depravity concerning women; hopping into bed with anyone who happened to be available.Sadly, I cannot recommend this series.",3,Disappointing Character with a Teen-age Libido,1319760000,"10 28, 2011",2011,1415,"['are', 'fans', 'Martin', 'Shaw', 'character', 'Judge', 'John', 'Deed', 'annoying', 'rather', 'juvenile', 'preoccupation', 'sex', 'show', 'interesting', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'one', 'impression', 'halfway', 'attractive', 'woman', 'close', 'going', 'get', 'propositioned', 'judge', 'regardless', 'married', 'single.Judge', 'Deed', 'one', 'hand', 'expressed', 'desire', 'find', 'truth', 'dispense', 'justice', 'bench', 'other', 'exhibited', 'rather', 'amazing', 'disregard', 'sanctity', 'marriage', 'seemed', 'see', 'women', 'primarily', 'sex', 'objects', 'was', 'rather', 'jarring', 'disconnect', 'interfered', 'enjoyment', 'story', 'when', 'pretty', 'woman', 'walked', 'room', 'one', 'began', 'fear', 'safety', 'judge', 'around.I', 'found', 'Deed', 'daughter', 'be', 'annoying', 'character', 'whom', 'end', 'justified', 'means', 'seemed', 'be', 'constantly', 'getting', 'trouble', 'actions', 'associations', 'then', 'calling', 'daddy', 'use', 'position', 'influence', 'get', 'trouble', 'repeated', 'indulgence', 'daughter', 'explain', 'how', 'became', 'what', 'was.All', 'told', 'found', 'series', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'internal', 'contradiction', 'be', 'watchable', 'claiming', 'moral', 'high', 'ground', 'bench', 'same', 'time', 'plumbed', 'depths', 'moral', 'depravity', 'concerning', 'women', 'hopping', 'bed', 'anyone', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'available.Sadly', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'series']",Judge John Deed : Pilot Episode + Complete Series 1 [NON-U.S.A.

The founding fathers were born British subjects and sought to preserve in a written constitution the rights implicit in the English unwritten constitution. Among those cardinal rights was the guarantee of an independent judiciary, a right which Edmund Burke described as ""the cold neutrality of an impartial judge.""Judge John Deed is a High Court justice. He wears scarlet robes trimmed in ermine. His elevation to the bench following a successful career as a crusading barrister was controversial. It is his lot to draw cases which are of some interest to the Lord Chancellor, who appoints judges to the bench but is simply another party politician. Thus arises the central theme of this series-are English judges a part of the government or do they stand apart from the government.John Deed allows much personal interference in his courtroom in a manner no real judge on either side of the pond would. He intervenes for his college-aged daughter, he presides over cases in which his long time love interest represents a party, he presides over cases in which his ex-wife is the barrister before him, he has ex parte meetings in chambers with barristers and witnesses appearing before him.The only interest this kind of conduct has to the Lord Chancllors office is it whether it can use it to either influence a decision or remove him from the bench. Complicating things is Deed's affair with the wife of his principal tormentor in the government, and this infidelity shakes his relationship with Mrs Mills, his long time girlfriend.But Deed will not compromise ever on the issue of the neutrality and independence of the judiciary. In each episode he risks personal disgrace to preserve the unwritten constitution my fellow countrymen so admired. It's fiction. It's preachy.

1288412,A1KHWLUBS5IK4Q,B002TJQLU8,janebbooks,"[1, 1]","Judge John Deed is a British legal drama television series produced by the BBC in association with One-Eyed Dog for BBC One. It was created by G.F. Newman and stars Martin Shaw as Sir John Deed, a High Court judge who tries to seek real justice in the cases before him. It also stars Jenny Seagrove as the barrister Jo Mills, frequently the object of Deed's desire.The pilot episode was broadcast on January 9, 2001, followed by the first full series in late November of 2001. The sixth and last series concluded in January of 2007. The program then went on an indefinite break after Shaw became involved in another television program (George Gently..2007-2012). By 2009, the series had officially been cancelled. The six series produced make it the longest-running BBC legal drama.The factual accuracy of the series is often criticised by legal professionals and journalists; many of the decisions taken by Deed are unlikely to happen in a real court. The romanticised vision of the court system created by Newman caused a judge to issue a warning to a jury not to let the series influence their view of trials-referring to an episode where Deed flouts rules when called up for jury duty. Another episode led to complaints about biased and incorrect information. An episode about the MMR vaccine was so controversial that BBC banned repeats of it in the original form.Sir John Deed (played by Martin Shaw) is a recently appointed High Court judge who actively seeks justice in the cases before him, while at the same time trying to rekindle an old romance with former pupil Jo Mills QC, who regularly appears in his court. Deed is described by creator and writer G.F. Newman as a character that ""speaks out against all the petty rules and bureaucracy that frustrates us all but that most of us don't speak out against"". Because of Deed's unorthodox actions, he is often hampered in his pursuit of justice by several more conventional-minded characters, including his ex-wife, barrister Georgina ""George"" Channing (played by Caroline Langrishe); her father Sir Joseph Channing (played by Sir Donald Sinden), Sir Monty Everard (played by Simon Ward), the Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor's Department (LCD, later Department of Constitutional Affairs); Sir Ian Rochester (played by Simon Chandler); and later the Home Secretary Neil Haughton MP (played by Aneirin Hughes). Other recurring characters include Deed's rebellious, activist daughter Charlie (played by Louisa Clein), who is initially a law student but later progresses to the courts; Deed's friend, police commissioner Row Colemore (played by Christopher Cazenove); and his clerk, Rita ""Coop"" Cooper (played by Barbara Thorn), who is often on hand to talk him out of his more ludicrous ideas.Having just watched the pilot episode, I have a few first impressions. Regarding the major cast, Martin Shaw who plays the title character loves the ladies. He propositions the barrister (Jenny Seagrove) appearing before him two or three times in the pilot. He has her introduce him to a pretty young woman who has just joined the staff working for the Crown. He even propositions his ex-wife George! These flirtations and a god-awful haircut make the Judge appear rather silly.....hardly worthy of his position. He does seem, however, a caring parent, willing to help his only child, a daughter Charlie, in almost any situation. Shaw was more sedate and charming as Dalgliesch in the two P. D. James' stories he filmed in 2003 and 2005. (And, no, favorite British tv series blogger...he doesn't look like Liam Neeson to me!)Deed's ex-wife George Channing (Caroline Langrishe) is rather beautiful and shapely. But I think she's badly miscast as a ""power point"" corporate attorney. I liked Ms Langrishe as the wealthy patron in the LOVEJOY series....a role more suited for her looks and talents. Jenny Seagrove, who plays the barrister Jo Mills, has really aged. I thought she was beautiful as Emma Harte in the Barbara Taylor Bradford's A WOMAN OF SUBSTANCE series...about a London family maid who became head of very large department store that resembled Harrod's of London. John and George's daughter Charlie (Louise Clein) is a gorgeous redhead (and a fine young actress). In her first-year at Oxford, Charlie's activist often illegal activities on and off campus rather enlivened a not so interesting ""case before the court."" I particularly liked the scene destroying crops with her cohorts covered by alien-like white suits. (Reminds me of the yellow rape scenes at the beginning of a Wallander...)The series should have been profitable for BBC. Settings for the most part were limited and minimal. G. F. Newman, the creator of the series, wrote 11 of the 29 episodes and directed two. Newman, as creator, seems to have written the series to reflect his lifestyle choices: he is a vegetarian, into alternative medicine, and an activist for social justice. This sort of influence probably made the success of the series. The British...as well as some colonials...seem to like quirky characters displaying titillating or risque behaviour and having little or no morals nor manners..especially when characters are gentry or lower upper-class. {Examples: William Boyd (Restless, Any Human Heart)...Susan Hill (The Various Haunts of Men)...}I borrowed most of the history and trivia of the series from a Wikipedia article...that I heavily edited. The ""facts"" almost intrigued me to continue watching the first season. But, no. Think I'll take a pause after viewing Season 1, Disc 1...maybe a permanent pause...",3,Some first impressions of the longest-running BBC legal drama series...,1381968000,"10 17,

Everyone in power is trying to get rid of Judge Deed, while his daughter is venerated for destroying the private property of businesses as a proper means of protesting. Judge Deed bemoans the waste of taxpayers' money on having to retry a case because of jury misconduct, but seems totally unsympathetic with the rise in the cost of goods because of money lost due to vandalism by protestors.  Does he actually believe that businesses are going to absorb losses due to the destruction of their property by protestors?  That cost, just like the cost of a company's lawyers and the cost of shoplifting and false claims is passed onto the consumer. I've only watched the pilot.  It is unrealistic and bent so far to the left it takes the joy out of watching Martin Shaw.  I can sympathize with his love for his daughter, but not his defense of her.

Judge John Deed (Season One - I've not seen subsequent seasons) is not as good as the Gently series, but the fault is not that of the actors: Shaw is very good here as the title character, and the supporting cast is very good, as well. The problems are the stories, the resolutions of which tend to be farfetched (the resolution of the pilot episode is jaw-dropping).Deed, as one would expect, is a champion of the wrongly accused, but his involvement in and his impact on the courtroom proceedings are far greater, I think, than one would see in this country, and, I suspect, in Britain, as well. Indeed, the series might better be titled John Deed: Judge and Jury. Especially puzzling are Deed's efforts to romance, fairly openly, a female barrister who is representing a defendant in his courtroom. Is the concept of a conflict of interest (or of judicial misconduct) unknown in Britain?One expects accuracy to fall victim to dramatic license, to some degree, in any TV series. That can happen and a story still work, at least for me, as long as there is some semblance of plausibility. Too often that tends not to be the case here. I admit to not knowing much about the workings of the British legal system, but it is difficult for me to believe that it is accurately depicted in this series.

1288422,A35DI28HRSEEP6,B002TJQLU8,Richard B. Schwartz,"[13, 13]","This is a hypnotic series, but one that is radically flawed.  The backstory: Deed is a baker's son (adopted, we later learn) who goes to Oxford and aces his legal studies.  A successful `radical' barrister he takes a 300% salary hit to become a judge.  On the bench he preempts the prosecutors and defense counsels by asking questions and interposing his own opinions.  He loves the law, but when the law or its processes get in the way of justice he finds other ways to achieve the latter.  This is a major problem for the bureaucrats in the Lord Chancellor's office who bedevil him with spies, moles, weasels and every manner of officialdom vermin.Oh yes, and he's got an overcharged libido which, very curiously and quite implausibly is seldom matched (despite his love of the law) with a superego.  He occasionally hits on his ex (`ice maiden') wife, continually attempts to seduce one of the QC's who appears before him in court but snuggles with him in chambers, and leaves room in his life for other female targets of opportunity, including the wife of the chief weasel in the Lord Chancellor's office.This is all sustained and held together by the remarkable performances of Martin Shaw, known to many as the `George Gently' character, but also the very best performer in the Adam Dalgleish role.  Shaw is the show, the whole show, and he is superb.The ins, outs and contortions of British law will be of great interest to American audiences.  The plots are never dull, but they are often wildly implausible.  The subplots with Judge Deed's daughter, `adopted' dog Rosie as well as adult, human females are engaging.  The episodes stand alone, but given the rhythms of the subplots it is best to see them in order.As you watch you are likely to be frustrated with the direction (nudge-nudge winking in the courtroom, inappropriate sexual interactions at precisely the wrong moments and especially the machinations of the Lord Chancellor's office's ferrets and dweebs).  At the same time you will be mesmerized by Shaw's performances and come running back for more.",4,"Hypnotic, Though Flawed",1313193600,"08 13, 2011",2011,2072,"['hypnotic', 'series', 'one', 'radically', 'flawed', 'backstory', 'Deed', 'baker', 'son', 'adopted', 'later', 'learn', 'who', 'Oxford', 'legal', 'studies', 'successful', 'radical', 'barrister', '300', '%', 'salary', 'hit', 'become', 'judge', 'bench', 'prosecutors', 'defense', 'counsels', 'asking', 'questions', 'interposing', 'own', 'opinions', 'law', 'when', 'law', 'processes', 'get', 'way', 'justice', 'other', 'ways', 'achieve', 'latter', 'major', 'problem', 'bureaucrats', 'Lord', 'Chancellor', 'office', 'who', 'bedevil', 'spies', 'moles', 'weasels', 'manner', 'officialdom', 'vermin.Oh', 'yes', 'got', 'overcharged', 'libido', 'very', 'curiously', 'quite', 'implausibly', 'seldom', 'matched', 'love', 'law', 'superego', 'occasionally', 'ex', 'ice', 'maiden', 'wife', 'continually', 'seduce', 'one', 'QC', 'who', 'court', 'snuggles', 'chambers', 'room', 'life', 'other', 'female', 'targets', 'opportunity', 'including', 'wife', 'chief', 'weasel', 'Lord', 'Chancellor', 'office.This', 'sustained', 'held', 'together', 'remarkable', 'performances', 'Martin', 'Shaw', 'known', 'many', 'George', 'Gently', 'character', 'also', 'very', 'best', 'performer', 'Adam', 'Dalgleish', 'role', 'Shaw', 'show', 'whole', 'show', 'superb.The', 'ins', 'outs', 'contortions', 'British', 'law', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'interest', 'American', 'audiences', 'plots', 'are', 'never', 'dull', 'are', 'often', 'wildly', 'implausible', 'subplots', 'Judge', 'Deed', 'daughter', 'adopted', 'dog', 'Rosie', 'as', 'well', 'adult', 'human', 'females', 'are', 'engaging', 'episodes', 'stand', 'alone', 'given', 'rhythms', 'subplots', 'best', 'see', 'order.As', 'watch', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'frustrated', 'direction', 'nudge-nudge', 'winking', 'courtroom', 'inappropriate', 'sexual', 'interactions', 'precisely', 'wrong', 'moments', 'especially', 'machinations', 'Lord', 'Chancellor', 'office', 'ferrets', 'dweebs', 'same', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'mesmerized', 'Shaw', 'performances', 'come', 'running', 'back', 'more']",Judge John Deed : Pilot Episode + Complete Series 1 [NON-U.S.A.

1288426,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B002TJQLU8,Stephanie De Pue,"[0, 0]","Judge John Deed, a British legal drama television series, was produced by the BBC in association with One-Eyed Dog for BBC One. The court room drama was created by G.F. Newman, filmed in Aylesbury Crown Court, Market Square, Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England, UK. It stars Martin Shaw as Sir John Deed, a High Court judge who tries to seek justice in the cases before him. And Jenny Seagrove as Mrs. Jo Mills, Q.C., a barrister who frequently appears before him, who was once his student, with whom he's still trying to rekindle their previous affair. The pilot episode was broadcast on January 9, 2001, followed by the first full series in late November of 2001. The sixth and last series concluded in January of 2007. The six series produced make it the longest-running BBC legal drama: Series 1 consists of the pilot and five episodes on three disks.The passionate and powerful, yet humorous Judge John Deed refuses to compromise his ideals, as he is determined to dispense real justice even if it means bending the letter of the law. This approach garners him a host of enemies along the course of his career as he faces a variety of complicated legal and moral predicaments: The British mystery series often finds him opposing the Lord Chancellor, Sir Ian Rochester, (Simon Chandler, PD JAMES: THE ADAM DALGLIESH CHRONICLES ).Shaw, who did similar work in Inspector George Gently: Series 1-5, and as perhaps the strongest Adam Dalgleish in two of the filmed versions of several of the works of P.D. James, carries the series ably, with abundant gravitas. Seagrove, perhaps best known for Barbara Taylor Bradford: A WOMAN OF SUBSTANCE , plays an intelligent, still lovely and passionate about the law and people woman who still has sparkling eyes. In three episodes, Jemma Redgrave, BRAMWELL, plays Francesca Rochester, Sir Ian's beautiful wife, with whom Deed has a brief affair. Powerful veteran actor Donald Sinden, DONALD SINDEN ICON BOX SET , plays high court official Sir Joseph Channing, with whom Deed frequently crosses swords as well; Channing is also Deed's former father-in-law. Caroline Langrishe, (LOVEJOY ) still blond and curvy after all these years, plays Georgina (George) Channing, Deed's ex-wife, high-powered attorney in her own right. Louisa Clein plays Charlie Deed, Judge Deed's wild-haired activist daughter who creates quite a bit of controversy herself. Simon Ward plays Sir Monty Everard, the permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor's Department, (LCD), another official who Deed often angers. T.R. Bowen plays Sir Michael Nivan, a colleague of Deed's; Christopher Cazenove plays Deed's friend Row Colemore, with whom he frequently literally crosses swords. Barbara Thorn plays Deed's clerk Rita ""Coop"" Cooper, who luckily is always on hand to talk him out of some of his more poorly thought out ideas.The episodes are:Disk One, the pilot, ""Exacting Justice."" The antics of Deed's daughter Charlie and her friends as they try to subvert the introduction of genetically modified crops to England cause Deed to grab a case about which he knows too much. Charlie and her friends are here particularly amusing as they trash a field in shiny white coveralls.Disk Two, ""Rough Justice."" Mr. Abbott, an important confidential informer to MI5, is accused of beating and abusing his wife. Three snarky young men are accused of doping a young woman with Rohypnol and raping her.""Duty of Care."" Deed maneuvers to get a major capitalist, carefully identified as a formerly-working class beneficiary of Thatcherism, an asset- and pension-stripper, charged with the death of a young man on one of his building sites. Deed's daughter Charlie dumps a beagle that she has rescued from an animal lab on him. The dog still bears an identifying tattoo on her ear. (There is no question but that animal labs do distressingly abuse beagles, as they are calm and affectionate creatures).Disk 3, ""Appropriate Response."" A man who believes Deed gave him too long a prison sentence gets out of jail and starts stalking Deed and his daughter. There are three cases in Deed's court at the time. Long-time quarreling brother attorneys. Possible police misconduct. And a former boxer, charged with beating his childhood best friend into disability when the defendant's wife, formerly childhood best friend with both of them, left the defendant for his victim.""Hidden Agenda."" An attractive young woman doctor is accused of killing an elderly rich man; she had convinced him to make her his heir. Deed's daughter Charlie pops up again, friends of a young couple. The woman has AIDS, which she is managing very well by herself. The local government is determined to test her infant child for AIDS.We learn that Deed is the adopted son of a baker; that he won a scholarship to Oxford; that he took a 300% pay cut to accept his judicial post, and that he enjoys the liveliest sex life he can manage. Despite that, and his frequent bending of the judicial rules, sometimes to the point of breaking them, or inaccuracy, the courtroom scenes were sometimes dull enough as to put me to sleep. Deed's daughter Charlie is a character who will irritate many viewers; she is a wild child whom her father indulges to the max. In fact, I understand that the creator/writer of the series, G.F. Newman, crafted Deed to resemble himself, as an outspoken liberal with a none-too-hidden agenda. This British television crime drama series reminded me of nothing so much as THE DEFENDERS, an earlier American TV courtroom drama series, in which E.G.
