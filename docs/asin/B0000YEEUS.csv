789228,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B0000YEEUS,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Roadhouse 66, 1984 filmThis is a low-budget action movie with a story set in the southwest. A young man is driving a two-seat 1955 Thunderbird along a less-traveled highway. A 1955 Chevy Bel-Air runs up along side and threatens him. A gunshot creates a leak in the T-bird's radiator. [This is set in the 1960s.] The T-bird driver picks up a hitchhiker and takes him along to a small town. [Johnny has a past that will be revealed later.] There is a problem in getting a radiator for the T-bird. Johnny helps out. [There is a contrast between a college-educated man and one with much practical knowledge, and the humor from this.] The characters of these individuals are shown by their speech.The bad guys in the 1955 Chevy arrive in town. There is a game of 8-ball (a symbolic battle). MBA-man and Johnny decide to race the T-bird in the annual ""66"" race on Route 66 which is limited to cars produced before 1966. The race has the usual action and conflicts needed for a movie that appeals to the 15 to 24 age group. There is also a fire from arson the death of an old man. There is a love interest between the men and the local auto parts store owner and her sister. The good guys win in the end after surviving their ordeal (the rule for these morality plays). Those who play by the rules wind up as the winners. This is a typical low-budget movie that is neither very good or very bad. Some younger people are tested by life, and succeed and survive. Those with flaws find their reward. [Note the absence of real families and society in this small town.]Route 66 was built to go from Chicago (the big city in the Mid-West) down south to Oklahoma and Texas and west to Los Angeles. The Interstate Highway Construction of the early 1920s built it and the Lincoln Highway (from New York to San Francisco, the two big financial cities on the oceans). The coming depression ended funding in 1927, there was no more until the 1950s when even more highways were built across the country until the 1970s. Travel by highways reduced and ended travel by railroads (the cost effective way to haul freight and passengers from one big city to another). Air travel also reduced railroad travel. The end result was to create a dependency on Big Oil, a fault that would soon be revealed in 1973 (in part to Nixon's devalued currency).These highways were great until the escalating prices for imported oil revealed the unpleasant flaw in this system. Are we really better off in transportation than a century ago? In many way yes. But the increased necessity of travel is not one of them. What can be done? Only more regulation of oil corporations and oil imports can free us from this addiction. Oil companies have closed down refineries to create a shortage of gasoline and escalating prices. Traveling to work and shopping have become dependent on automobile travel. The power of big oil has destroyed the small businesses that used to be just a few blocks away from your home (as before the 1960s). Most people who experienced life from WW I have joined the Silent Majority and cannot s speak about those times. You can learn about life then by watching ""The Best Years of Their Lives"" (even though it is a Hollywood story).",3,Road Rage and Racing,1335398400,"04 26, 2012",2012,3214,"['Roadhouse', '66', '1984', 'filmThis', 'low-budget', 'action', 'movie', 'story', 'set', 'southwest', 'young', 'man', 'driving', 'two-seat', '1955', 'Thunderbird', 'less-traveled', 'highway', '1955', 'Chevy', 'Bel-Air', 'up', 'along', 'side', 'gunshot', 'leak', 'T-bird', 'radiator', '[', 'set', '1960s', ']', 'T-bird', 'driver', 'up', 'hitchhiker', 'along', 'small', 'town', '[', 'Johnny', 'past', 'will', 'be', 'revealed', 'later', ']', 'problem', 'getting', 'radiator', 'T-bird', 'Johnny', 'out', '[', 'contrast', 'college-educated', 'man', 'one', 'much', 'practical', 'knowledge', 'humor', ']', 'characters', 'individuals', 'are', 'shown', 'speech.The', 'bad', 'guys', '1955', 'Chevy', 'arrive', 'town', 'game', '8-ball', 'symbolic', 'battle', 'MBA-man', 'Johnny', 'decide', 'race', 'T-bird', 'annual', '66', 'race', 'Route', '66', 'limited', 'cars', 'produced', '1966', 'race', 'usual', 'action', 'conflicts', 'needed', 'movie', 'appeals', '15', '24', 'age', 'group', 'also', 'fire', 'death', 'old', 'man', 'love', 'interest', 'men', 'local', 'auto', 'parts', 'store', 'owner', 'sister', 'good', 'guys', 'win', 'end', 'surviving', 'ordeal', 'rule', 'morality', 'plays', 'who', 'play', 'rules', 'wind', 'up', 'winners', 'typical', 'low-budget', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'very', 'bad', 'younger', 'people', 'are', 'tested', 'life', 'succeed', 'survive', 'flaws', 'find', 'reward', '[', 'Note', 'absence', 'real', 'families', 'society', 'small', 'town', ']', 'Route', '66', 'was', 'built', 'go', 'Chicago', 'big', 'city', 'Mid-West', 'down', 'south', 'Oklahoma', 'Texas', 'west', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Interstate', 'Highway', 'Construction', 'early', '1920s', 'built', 'Lincoln', 'Highway', 'New', 'York', 'San', 'Francisco', 'two', 'big', 'financial', 'cities', 'oceans', 'coming', 'depression', 'ended', 'funding', '1927', 'was', 'more', '1950s', 'when', 'even', 'more', 'highways', 'were', 'built', 'country', '1970s', 'Travel', 'highways', 'reduced', 'ended', 'travel', 'railroads', 'cost', 'effective', 'way', 'haul', 'freight', 'passengers', 'one', 'big', 'city', 'Air', 'travel', 'also', 'reduced', 'railroad', 'travel', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'create', 'dependency', 'Big', 'Oil', 'fault', 'would', 'soon', 'be', 'revealed', '1973', 'part', 'Nixon', 'devalued', 'currency', '.These', 'highways', 'were', 'great', 'escalating', 'prices', 'imported', 'oil', 'revealed', 'unpleasant', 'flaw', 'system', 'Are', 'really', 'better', 'off', 'transportation', 'century', 'ago', 'many', 'way', 'yes', 'increased', 'necessity', 'travel', 'not', 'one', 'What', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'Only', 'more', 'regulation', 'oil', 'corporations', 'oil', 'imports', 'can', 'free', 'addiction', 'Oil', 'companies', 'have', 'closed', 'down', 'refineries', 'create', 'shortage', 'gasoline', 'escalating', 'prices', 'Traveling', 'work', 'shopping', 'have', 'become', 'dependent', 'automobile', 'travel', 'power', 'big', 'oil', 'destroyed', 'small', 'businesses', 'used', 'be', 'just', 'few', 'blocks', 'away', 'home', '1960s', 'Most', 'people', 'who', 'experienced', 'life', 'WW', 'have', 'joined', 'Silent', 'Majority', 'can', 'not', 's', 'speak', 'times', 'can', 'learn', 'life', 'then', 'watching', 'Best', 'Years', 'Their', 'Lives', 'even', 'Hollywood', 'story']",Roadhouse 66

Reinhold somehow built a career on Billy from Beverly Hills Cop and a guest spot as the ""close talker"" on Seinfeld, while Dafoe earned well-deserved fame from films such as Last Temptation of Christ and Platoon, though his best work may actually be 2002's Auto Focus. You could say that pairing them together is movie magic, but you would be wrong.In fact, the movie is a complete bomb. Lead female Kaaren Lee can't act her way out of a wet paper bag, there's no real laughs nor any credible drama, and no one is helped by the piss-poor direction from first-timer John Mark Robinson. This movie blows chunks of chicken-fried steak.
