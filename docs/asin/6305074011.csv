446051,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6305074011,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[5, 5]","Just when you thought that you knew everything about Hong Kong cinema or about romantic adventures in film, director Kar Wai Wong steps forward and eliminates all boundaries.  Transforming your typical picture of a straight couple and violently handing us the relationship of Yiu-fai and Po-wing using untraditional cinematography is only scratching the surface of this picture.  If you found yourself shocked by the opening sequence or annoyed by the drastic image of the film, then you definitely are not a film junkie.  This movie had everything a cinephile would desire like strong characters, a non-linear story, and the brazen truth about modern society's relationships.  This was more than just a gay film, but instead a story about emotions and loves, coupled with all the turmoil that surrounds it.  It is ironic that the title of the film is Happy Together, because it completely challenges the true themes.  It is about love, but about the difficulties that surround a dying relationship.  From the visual opening to the amazing use of several different cinematography techniques, Happy Together may not suit everyone, but to this film junkie it opened a new door in Hong Kong cinema.This film would not have worked if it weren't for the apparent brilliance of director Kar Wai Wong.  While I have been impressed with his other films like In the Mood for Love and his work on the BMW series, The Hire, this film literally blew me out of the water.  To begin, the opening sequence.  If this very sexual opening doesn't set the tone for the rest of the film, I don't know what will.  I was shocked, disturbed, and on-edge the entire time.  I didn't see the love between our two characters at all in the beginning, but that was because it was to show the destruction of their relationship.  Then, Wong did several things that just impressed me and kept my attention focused on the film.  First, he took these two vacationing men from Hong Kong and set them in a foreign city.  So, not only was it uneasy to watch this relationship disintegrate in front of our eyes, but to be lost in a unfamiliar city only made it worse.  Second, he focused the camera on only one of the characters (Yiu-fai) to enhance that sensation about Po-wing's indiscretions.  Through Yiu-fai we felt the human emotions just boil through of having to see a love that only hurt.  Finally, he continually changed the cinematography through different scenes.  This was impressive because it only added more tension to our characters and themes.  Two travelers lost in a foreign country, trying to patch a dying relationship, with a constantly changing cinematic style, was tough to watch ... but that was the theme that Wong wanted to capture.  This is not your typical romantic picture, but instead it showcases the truth about two men that perhaps were not the greatest fit.  Even when he throws in the waterfall element, it only adds to the overall theme.  The waterfall, to me, represented the falling relationship.  Beauty on the outside, a violent tendency as the water falls ... just like our relationship.Wong successfully created this tension by hiring some of Hong Kong's best actors.  They carried themselves with the greatest of comfort and control.  I felt as if I knew these characters by the end of the film.  I felt as if I had gone through a similar struggle as they did.  These two men challenged the idea of ""normal"" relationships, yet kept their personas simple, human, and intense.  You could not help but feel emotion for these two, even if you did not like the story.  They kept the tones light when they needed to be, then brought you deep within the rabbit hole when the darkness erupted.  The final scenes of this film are fascinating to watch, and I had to see them again.  The downfall of Yiu-fai into a role similar to Po-wing was heartbreaking, yet stunning.  Here we have two men who I thought were complete opposites from the beginning, yet somehow, to quote Wong, ""Turns out that lonely people are all the same.""Finally, I cannot finish without saying that the cinematography was outstanding in this film.  The use of black and white in the beginning and slowly bringing in the colors was breathtaking.  This film was more than just actors working for a director, but instead a director creating art. Christopher Doyle bulls-eyed the tone of the film and brought forth an intense picture that only complimented Wong's work.  It just impresses me to see a film, like Happy Together, where all the elements come together and work in unison.  It is a rarity in today's Hollywood, but thankfully we have directors like Kar Wai Wong whom embrace it.  From the beginning of the movie until the final scenes, Doyle challenges and brings together some of the most beautiful scenes in cinema, transforming the normal into the extraordinary.Overall, this was a spectacular film.  After I watched it the first time, I had to see it again, but didn't know if I could.  Its emotional strength was so overwhelming that I had to stop myself.  I couldn't watch these two brilliant actors tear my heart apart again.  It was a sad film, it was an angry film, but most importantly it was a film about being lost in love.  Those who may have enjoyed Lost in Translation, this would be a great film to match with it.  While not structured the same, it does give us that feeling of being apart in a new world, struggling to get home or to discover one's self.  Wong is one of the greatest directors in the world, and I cannot wait to open my soul to his work again.  Brilliant filmmaking, determined and unmatched acting, coupled with the best cinematography this world has ever encountered!  A must for everyone!Grade: **** out of *****",4,Turns out that lonely people are all the same.,1123372800,"08 7, 2005",2005,5727,"['Just', 'when', 'thought', 'knew', 'everything', 'Hong', 'Kong',

446053,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6305074011,Andrew Ellington,"[7, 8]","Some films just understand human emotion better than others.  `Chun Gwong Cha Sit' is one of those films.  It completely destroys me emotionally because it completely understands what it means to be human and in love.If you've read my reviews then you may know that I have a rocky relationship with director Kar Wai Wong.  My first experience was with the unfortunate `My Blueberry Nights', and following that up with the overrated `Chung Hing Sam Lam' was not a good thing.  I found myself wondering just why this guy was so lauded.  Then, because I was heavily persuaded, I sat down to watch `Fa Yeung Nin Wa' and was so blown away (one of the best films I have ever seen, and I've seen a LOT of films) that I was willing to watch anything this guy has made and ever will make based on the brilliance of that film alone.So that brings me to `Chun Gwong Cha Sit', a film that is so tragically beautiful (for many of the same reasons that `Fa Yeung Nin Wa' was so tragically beautiful) that I am brought to my knees once again.Having given this film some time to soak in, I am ready and willing to label it a masterpiece.The film tells of the rocky relationship between Lai Yiu-Fai and Ho Po-Wing; two gay lovers living in Argentina.  On the films outset we are informed that their relationship is highly unstable.  En route to visit a beautiful waterfall they have a falling out and separate.  This is not uncommon, according to Lai's narration.  They are reunited and, after a serious altercation, Ho winds up injured and in Lai's care.  The two are obviously deeply in love, yet they are both very passionate and incompatible people.  Their fights are aggressive and soon their relationship begins to fray.  This does not detract from the fact that they are, without a doubt, in love.There are many aspects of this film that are noteworthy and that, after reflection, continue to haunt the viewer.  Ho, for instance, appears to use and abuse the love shown by Lai; almost resenting him for being there for him.  Despite the mistreatment, Lai struggles to contemplate a life without Ho.  Having personally been in a relationship where I was constantly used (and having to deal with a completely self-centered individual) I can sympathize with the feeling of being `stuck'.  If you stay, you continue to be abused but if you leave you will suffer the dark depths of loneliness.  There is also the relationship that spawns between Lai and Chang, a young co-worker who is sowing his oats away from home.  Their relationship, while never truly intimate, becomes a focal point for the discussion of male bonding.And then there is that lamp, the representation of a life of dreams yet to be fulfilled.With any character driven drama, the finest asset is always the acting.  Even if the story itself is flawless, the actors still need to sell it.  Leslie Cheung and especially Tony Leung (who delivers one of the best performances of the 90's) are more than up to the task of selling this film.  With deeply detailed and virtually contradictive characters, these two actors feed off one another without ever losing themselves as individuals.  These two men couldn't be more different, yet they compliment one another beautifully.  Cheung understands the arrogance that comes from this character's passion, and Leung subtly shatters us with the pain etched on his very face.  There are so many memorable moments when concerning these two performances, but one in particular comes very early in the film, when the two men are reunited.  Watch for Leung's explosive confrontation to see the full gravity of his performance.Breathtaking.In the end I am simply blow away by this tour-de-force film.  Every cavity is impeccably fleshed out to deliver one of the most shockingly real and beautifully moving pieces of cinema.",5,Sometimes all you need is to just start over...,1273190400,"05 7, 2010",2010,3812,"['films', 'just', 'understand', 'human', 'emotion', 'better', 'others', 'Chun', 'Gwong', 'Cha', 'Sit', 'one', 'films', 'completely', 'emotionally', 'completely', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'love.If', ""'ve"", 'read', 'reviews', 'then', 'may', 'know', 'have', 'rocky', 'relationship', 'director', 'Kar', 'Wai', 'Wong', 'first', 'experience', 'was', 'unfortunate', 'Blueberry', 'Nights', 'following', 'overrated', 'Chung', 'Hing', 'Sam', 'Lam', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'thing', 'found', 'wondering', 'just', 'why', 'guy', 'was', 'so', 'lauded', 'Then', 'was', 'heavily', 'persuaded', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'Fa', 'Yeung', 'Nin', 'Wa', 'was', 'so', 'blown', 'away', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'LOT', 'films', 'was', 'willing', 'watch', 'anything', 'guy', 'made', 'ever', 'will', 'make', 'based', 'brilliance', 'film', 'alone.So', 'Chun', 'Gwong', 'Cha', 'Sit', 'film', 'so', 'tragically', 'beautiful', 'many', 'same', 'reasons', 'Fa', 'Yeung', 'Nin', 'Wa', 'was', 'so', 'tragically', 'beautiful', 'am', 'brought', 'knees', 'once', 'again.Having', 'given', 'film', 'time', 'soak', 'am', 'ready', 'willing', 'label', 'masterpiece.The', 'film', 'tells', 'rocky', 'relationship', 'Lai', 'Yiu-Fai', 'Ho', 'Po-Wing', 'two', 'gay', 'lovers', 'living', 'Argentina', 'films', 'are', 'informed', 'relationship', 'highly', 'unstable', 'En', 'route', 'visit', 'beautiful', 'waterfall', 'have', 'falling', 'out', 'separate', 'not', 'uncommon', 'according', 'Lai', 'narration', 'are', 'reunited', 'serious', 'altercation', 'Ho', 'up', 'injured', 'Lai', 'care', 'two', 'are', 'obviously', 'deeply', 'love', 'yet', 'are', 'very', 'passionate', 'incompatible', 'people', 'fights', 'are', 'aggressive', 'soon', 'relationship', 'fray', 'not', 'detract', 'fact', 'are', 'doubt', 'are', 'many', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'noteworthy', 'reflection', 'continue', 'haunt', 'viewer', 'Ho', 'instance', 'use', 'abuse', 'love', 'shown', 'Lai', 'almost', 'resenting', 'being', 'mistreatment', 'Lai', 'contemplate', 'life', 'Ho', 'Having', 'personally', 'been', 'relationship', 'where', 'was', 'constantly', 'used', 'having', 'deal', 'completely', 'self-centered', 'individual', 'can', 'sympathize', 'feeling', 'being', 'stuck', 'stay', 'continue', 'be', 'abused', 'leave', 'will', 'suffer', 'dark', 'depths', 'loneliness', 'also', 'relationship', 'Lai', 'Chang', 'young', 'co-worker', 'who', 'sowing', 'oats', 'away', 'home', 'relationship', 'never', 'truly', 'intimate', 'focal', 'point', 'discussion', 'male', 'bonding.And', 'then', 'lamp', 'representation', 'life', 'dreams', 'yet', 'be', 'fulfilled.With', 'character', 'driven', 'drama', 'finest', 'asset', 'always', 'acting', 'Even', 'story', 'flawless', 'actors', 'still', 'need', 'sell', 'Leslie', 'Cheung', 'especially', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'who', 'one', 'best', 'performances', '90', 'are', 'more', 'up', 'task', 'selling', 'film', 'deeply', 'detailed', 'virtually', 'contradictive', 'characters', 'two', 'actors', 'feed', 'off', 'one', 'ever', 'losing', 'individuals', 'two', 'men', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'different', 'yet', 'compliment', 'one', 'beautifully', 'Cheung', 'arrogance', 'character', 'passion', 'Leung', 'subtly', 'pain', 'etched', 'very', 'face', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'memorable', 'moments', 'when', 'concerning', 'two', 'performances', 'one', 'particular', 'very', 'early', 'film', 'when', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'reunited', 'Watch', 'Leung', 'explosive', 'confrontation', 'see', 'full', 'gravity', 'performance.Breathtaking.In', 'end', 'am', 'simply', 'blow', 'away', 'tour-de-force', 'film', 'cavity', 'impeccably', 'fleshed', 'out', 'deliver', 'one', 'most', 'shockingly', 'real', 'beautifully', 'moving', 'pieces', 'cinema']",Happy Together VHS

446056,A26L2EQ97ML3OW,6305074011,"""bruce452""","[11, 16]","This is an excellent film by an exciting director.  The cinematography is exciting, breath-taking at times; the soundtrack is absolutely delightful.  I was so impressed with Happy Together, I rented the only other film by Wong Kar-Wai I could find, Chungking Express, which is also excellent.  I wish it also was a gay film.Happy Together is not an easy film, however.  It depicts a drawn out and very messy breakup of two desperately in love young men.  There is the expected difficulty of it being a foreign language film and I was put off by the sometimes very poor subtitling (it shouldn't be that hard to find someone in Hong Kong who speaks good English, should it?)  Besides stupid grammatical errors, the words sometimes do not seem to match the tone of voice or actions on screen, more so for Ho Po-Wing than for Fai Yui-Lai; I kept wondering what was being lost in the translation.On many subsequent viewings I have come to appreciate the musicality of the language and it is part of my enjoyment of the film.  When I replay the scenes in my mind, I hear them as well as see them -- perhaps the influence of Chang?  But I am still irritated by the subtitles.I was also put off by the intensity of Fai's anger, which it took me a long time to figure out.Despite these difficulties, I loved the sound track and cinematography and they were enough to keep me watching while the story was leaving me cold.  The opening scenes in Argentina are reminscent, for me, of Hud, a film I saw at an impressionable age, the memory of which still blows me away.  But I was not really engrossed in the film until the scene of Fai with Chang's recorder at Tres Amigos.  Once I finally got clued in to the emotional story line I watched with total attention and in no time Happy Together has become one of my favorite gay films.When these two are in love - the dance scenes in the tenement kitchen are particularly well done - they are a joy to watch.  When they are fighting, I can't take my eyes off of them.  The anguish which the two feel, particularly Ho, when they realize it's really over, is very powerful.Fai's visit to the night market at Taipei sets off some very loud chimes in the back of my head.

It might be a little too much to say that he revolutionizes the state of world cinema as there is no such revolution in the recent years the way the French New Wave changed the look and image of the cinematic world in the 60s.  However, you can definitely sense that the ambition is there.It takes courage to make a romantic gay film.  It takes all the courage in the world to make a romantic Chinese gay film set in latin America.  How many people in the world can actually say, 'hey, I can identify with this movie,' apart from its portrayal of love's imperfection.  Unrequited love is a theme that is present in almost every Wong Kar Wai movie and it is amazing that at this point he has not worn the viewers down.  It is his ability to deliver a somewhat new perspective with every film that keeps a fan like me coming back again and again to watch what he has to offer.  This movie is no different.This movie has the two best actors that Hong Kong has to offer and they don't pull any punches here.  The partnership between Wong with Tony Leung Chiu Wai and Leslie Cheung Kuo Rung stretches far back.  It seems that Wong has the ability to draw the best out of these two actors.  Tony Leung would go on to nab the Best actor award in the Cannes film festival with his role in 'In the Mood for Love,' another movie by Wong.  Unfortunately, Leslie Cheung had been typecast as an effiminate leading man once too often that this movie does not showcase his acting prowess as much as it could be.This is perhaps one of the most romantic movie I have ever watched in the recent years.  It would be a gross injustice to simply label this film as a gay flick.  Wong will show you that love is universal regardless of ethicity, nationality or sexual orientation.  As corny and preachy that might sound, you have to look at the odds (by the virtue of the character placements) the movie has to overcome to carry this message across.  And when I still daydream about being able to catch a  glimpse of the Iguacu Falls in its glory with my loved one, you can say that the movie has succeeded beyond all expectations.",5,The dream of being happy together,1005609600,"11 13, 2001",2001,2180,"['Enough', 'been', 'said', 'Wong', 'Kar', 'Wai', 'brilliant', 'visual', 'direction', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'say', 'state', 'world', 'cinema', 'such', 'revolution', 'recent', 'years', 'way', 'French', 'New', 'Wave', 'changed', 'look', 'image', 'cinematic', 'world', '60s', 'However', 'can', 'definitely', 'sense', 'ambition', 'there.It', 'courage', 'make', 'romantic', 'gay', 'film', 'courage', 'world', 'make', 'romantic', 'Chinese', 'gay', 'film', 'set', 'latin', 'America', 'How', 'many', 'people', 'world', 'can', 'actually', 'say', ""'hey"", 'can', 'identify', 'movie', 'apart', 'portrayal', 'love', 'imperfection', 'Unrequited', 'love', 'theme', 'present', 'almost', 'Wong', 'Kar', 'Wai', 'movie', 'amazing', 'point', 'not', 'worn', 'viewers', 'down', 'ability', 'deliver', 'somewhat', 'new', 'perspective', 'film', 'fan', 'coming', 'back', 'again', 'again', 'watch', 'what', 'offer', 'movie', 'different.This', 'movie', 'two', 'best', 'actors', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'offer', 'do', ""n't"", 'pull', 'punches', 'here', 'partnership', 'Wong', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'Chiu', 'Wai', 'Leslie', 'Cheung', 'Kuo', 'Rung', 'far', 'back', 'Wong', 'ability', 'draw', 'best', 'two', 'actors', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'would', 'go', 'nab', 'Best', 'actor', 'award', 'Cannes', 'film', 'festival', 'role', 'Mood', 'Love', 'movie', 'Wong', 'Unfortunately', 'Leslie', 'Cheung', 'had', 'been', 'typecast', 'effiminate', 'leading', 'man', 'once', 'too', 'often', 'movie', 'not', 'showcase', 'acting', 'prowess', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'be.This', 'perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'romantic', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'recent', 'years', 'would', 'be', 'gross', 'injustice', 'simply', 'label', 'film', 'gay', 'flick', 'Wong', 'will', 'show', 'love', 'universal', 'regardless', 'ethicity', 'nationality', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'corny', 'preachy', 'might', 'sound', 'have', 'look', 'odds', 'virtue', 'character', 'placements', 'movie', 'overcome', 'carry', 'message', 'when', 'still', 'daydream', 'being', 'able', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'Iguacu', 'Falls', 'glory', 'loved', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'succeeded', 'expectations']",Happy Together VHS

This visually arresting though rather discombobulated film from 1997 is more modest in scope, as it focuses on the unhealthily co-dependent relationship between two on-again, off-again gay lovers from Hong Kong, who end up broke on a last-chance trip to Argentina. In a volatile yin-yang situation, Ho Po-Wing is the cockier and apparently needier of the two, always in search of the next rush of instant gratification regardless of the source, while Lai Yiu-Fai is the controlling partner either unblinkingly morose or explosively volatile. In terms of where the story starts, their relationship has become nothing but a series of arguments and break-ups.With no flashback to point to a happier time or a hint of a positive indication as to why they are together, Wong comes up short in inflaming any sparks that could still be struck between lovers who argue constantly. Moreover, the film really has little structure other than to show the difficulties which people have in sustaining a connection. A third person is introduced but in an intentionally vague manner, as Lai gets a new job at a restaurant and meets the effusive Chang, a young Taiwanese trying to earn enough to fund his travels abroad. A romance does not occur but an emotional connection does, which causes Lai to make moves toward liberating himself from his depraved situation.Except for a somewhat graphic opening scene, the homosexual elements are downplayed in favor of a kinetic energy that leverages Christopher Doyle's creative cinematography. Doyle combines black-and-white sequences with color, as well as the random use of different film stocks, exposures and frame rates to manipulate the passage of time. He also lends stunning overview shots of Iguazu Falls, the movie's metaphorical centerpiece, lending a dream-like, salvation quality to the couple's hoped-for destination. Both the attractive leads lend visceral energy and an emotional authenticity to their roles - Wong's favorite leading man, Tony Leung Chiu-wai as Lai and the late Leslie Cheung as Ho. The passionate, often violent dynamics between the two are convincing. Chen Chang effectively infuses Chang with an idealism that makes Lai's attraction, platonic or not, understandable.Although I think Wong is a supremely talented director, I was surprised to find out that this film earned him the Best Director prize at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival, flawed as the film is. Although it is as visually audacious as ""2046"", I have to admit I was left a bit cold emotionally by the end product. The DVD does include an invaluable looking-back documentary called ""Buenos Aires - Zero Degree"".

On vacation from Hong Kong, Yiu-Fai (Tony Leung ) and Po-Wing (Leslie Cheung) are presented in an obviously unhappy state, but we are not privy to the cause of their unhappiness.  Yes, there is infidelity, there are outside attractions, and all of the `things' that could create this state, but we are left to look at this sad young couple as a metaphor for the struggles in emotions and loves that so often surface in a dying relationship, not only in the gay relationship we are seeing but in straight  relationships as well.  The universals hold true.Kar Wai Wong loves the non-linear approach to story telling and in this early film the method of his direction feels a bit too disjointed, too uninvolved in the character development.  Not that the actors do not render fine performances: both Leung and Cheung give brave portrayals of lost souls and we cannot help but care for both of them.  And the remainder of the cast is on target (Chen Chang and Gregory Dayton).What holds the little hints of greatness that were to come (this film dates back to 1997) is suggested in the lighting and camera work, both of which provide as major a role in the film as the actors and chaotic storyline.  The unity of mood and story is solidly at one in this little film, showing us just how creative the writer director was to become.

446071,A3J4MJ480LKZBN,6305074011,martin j.,"[0, 0]","Viewing this film was like watching the Tango! Leslie Cheung and Tony Leung were absolutely mesmerizing as lovers who exist in a state of conflict, constantly estranged from their homeland, their loved-ones and each other. The ending was heartrending (no surprise), but I found the interaction between the couple to be pure comedy. The situations that each character found himself in were anything but funny, however, the ups and downs in their relationship were so realistic that I couldn't help but laugh at how insane love can be.Regardless of race, class, gender, culture, sexual orientation and even geography, this movie will serve as a love letter to anyone who has the misfortune of being truly, madly and deeply in love with the one person on earth who drives them nuts. Those of us fitting this description will find many confirmations (but no comfort) in Yiu-Fai and Po-Wing's story. I could totally relate to Yiu-Fai when he stated that Po-Wing's illness was actually the time when they were the happiest together. Moreover, the story paints a vivid portrait of long-term relationships as swaying perilously between states of codependence, complacency and claustrophobia.If I had to decide on a letter grade, though, I would have to give the movie an, ""A-"" instead of an, ""A"" because I was hoping that Leslie Cheung would not be confined to the typical ""doomed drama-queen"" role. Ironically, the story explores individual, national and global identity when, throughout the cinema world, one is hard pressed to find performers who rival Tony Leung's depth and Leslie Cheung's range. Despite his hallmark androgyny, I personally believe that Cheung could play Rambo convincingly! The universal nature of the story was also threatened by its stereotypical depiction of gay life (not all gay relationships are violent and not all gay people are promiscuous). I think the film's core message could have been conveyed just as effectively without the use of hackneyed scenarios.

When I watched the movie for the first time, I did so with no prior knowledge of the film other than it was a love story between two men.  If you're over 30, you have probably lived this story.  You may have been Ho Po Wing (Leslie Cheung) or you may have been Lai Yiu Fai (Tony Leung), but you have undoubtedly been involved in a romance much like the one portrayed in this movie.Happy Together has nothing to do with being gay.  It has everything to do with love, loss, regret and emotional growth.  I saw myself in both Po Wing's character and Yiu Fai's character.  In many ways, I felt my life was being shown in this movie.  I have loved men who hurt me and emotionally abused me, but I couldn't say no when asked to ""start again.""  Conversely, I have callously mistreated some very nice guys just because it was so easy to do it.  And, just like Po Wing, I cried with regret when I realized what I had thrown away.You can read a lot of deep meaning into this movie, but ultimately it is a love story which is all too familiar to the majority of us.  If it is hard to watch, it is because we see ourselves in the characters onscreen.  It shouldn't be because the characters are two men.  Love is love.Leslie Cheung is both hateful and sympathetic.  He is mesmermizing onscreen.  Tony Leung is, for the most part, very convincing as Po Wing's long-suffering lover, although I did feel Leung was somewhat uncomfortable in some of his scenes.  Still, it didn't detract from my overall enjoyment of the film.  My favorite scene in the movie is a flashback of Po Wing and Yiu Fai dancing in the kitchen.  It isn't erotic.  They are simply holding each other and moving to the music.  I felt it conveyed their love for each other more than any other moment in the movie.Although this movie can be enjoyed on many levels, I choose to view it as a love story that each of us has experienced some time in our life.

It is the story of two gay Chinese men in Buenos Aires, who are more often unhappy together than happy together.  It is not an easy movie to watch perhaps and will not appeal to everyone, but as an art film and a gay-themed love story it is a contemporary classic.I had an earlier release of this DVD, but purchased this new edition to see the making-of documentary Buenos Aires: Zero Degrees, which is a special feature on the new release.  The documentary itself is a gem as it reveals so many storylines that did not appear in the final film. It is fascinating to see the directions the film might have taken and how such a different film could have come out of the editing room.  We can really appreciate Wong Kar-Wai's process, working without a script, and see the difficulties it causes for the actors.  Lead actor Tony Leung's comments about working on the film are especially insightful.Wong Kar-Wai's In the mood for love is the film that brought him the greatest international recognition perhaps, but Happy Together was an important step on the road to that masterpiece.  Few new fans will be won by this DVD, but for those who already appreciate Wong Kar-Wai's work this DVD is a must-have.",4,Happy Together / Buenos Aires Zero Degrees,1100304000,"11 13, 2004",2004,1385,"['Fans', 'Chinese', 'director', 'Wong', 'Kar-Wai', 'will', 'be', 'thrilled', 'new', 'DVD', 'edition', 'classic', 'film', 'Happy', 'Together.The', 'movie', 'slow-paced', 'low-key', 'often', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'story', 'two', 'gay', 'Chinese', 'men', 'Buenos', 'Aires', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'often', 'unhappy', 'together', 'happy', 'together', 'not', 'easy', 'movie', 'watch', 'perhaps', 'will', 'not', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'art', 'film', 'gay-themed', 'love', 'story', 'contemporary', 'classic.I', 'had', 'earlier', 'release', 'DVD', 'purchased', 'new', 'edition', 'see', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'Buenos', 'Aires', 'Zero', 'Degrees', 'special', 'feature', 'new', 'release', 'documentary', 'gem', 'so', 'many', 'storylines', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'final', 'film', 'fascinating', 'see', 'directions', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'taken', 'how', 'such', 'different', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'editing', 'room', 'can', 'really', 'appreciate', 'Wong', 'Kar-Wai', 'process', 'working', 'script', 'see', 'difficulties', 'actors', 'Lead', 'actor', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'comments', 'working', 'film', 'are', 'especially', 'insightful.Wong', 'Kar-Wai', 'mood', 'love', 'film', 'brought', 'greatest', 'international', 'recognition', 'perhaps', 'Happy', 'Together', 'was', 'important', 'step', 'road', 'masterpiece', 'Few', 'new', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'won', 'DVD', 'who', 'already', 'appreciate', 'Wong', 'Kar-Wai', 'work', 'DVD', 'must-have']",Happy Together VHS

446083,A1SPB225CVTRUU,6305074011,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[4, 4]","I saw this movie many years ago(97) at the same time when Tony Leung's girlfriend(Carina Lau) who is my #1 favorite actress also starred in the heavy-duty melodramatic lesbian romance film called Intimates(Self-combed). It was such a treat to see Leung and Lau indulging themselves into two movies that was controversial and a taboo subject. I was very moved by Happy together, but I enjoyed Intimates more, because it was more elaborate and it was absolutely Lau's most powerful performance of her career, way better than Days of Being Wild, I Am Sorry, Infernal Affairs 2. Anyways, let me get back to Happy Together.Tony and Leslie's characters might have been happy together before, but they had no more happiness in the movie. Perhaps even going to Argentina for exile won't make things back to the way they were. There's a few irreconcilable differences between the two. Tony is hard working, down-to-earth and monogamous. Leslie is lazy, rebelious, and sexually promiscuous. They broke up, and inevitably, Leslie would say:"" Let's start over again."" But Tony has lost his faith in Leslie, and just wants to move on.Then Leslie became self-destructive and sells his body for a living. It was very emtionally impacting to see Leslie cry his heart out when he realized that Tony is out of his life. Tony drove himself to the waterfall and stared at it while he's thinking about Leslie. It was visually stunning. Tony's co-worker played by Chang Chen was secretly in love with him, but Tony didn't have room in his heart for anyone. He decided to abandon Leslie and return to Hong Kong.The love scene was pretty convincing. I guessed Leslie must have helped Tony to get into character. Both of them gave ""career best"" performances, but Tony has more screen time.The cinematography, soundtrack, art direction, and WKW's direction are perfect. You don't have to be gay to enjoy this film, because it's trully beautiful!",5,Tony Leung and Leslie Cheung are deeply penetrating!,1101081600,"11 22, 2004",2004,1919,"['saw', 'movie', 'many', 'years', 'ago', '97', 'same', 'time', 'when', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'girlfriend', 'Carina', 'Lau', 'who', '1', 'favorite', 'actress', 'also', 'starred', 'heavy-duty', 'melodramatic', 'lesbian', 'romance', 'film', 'called', 'Intimates', 'Self-combed', 'was', 'such', 'treat', 'see', 'Leung', 'Lau', 'indulging', 'two', 'movies', 'was', 'controversial', 'taboo', 'subject', 'was', 'very', 'moved', 'Happy', 'together', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'was', 'more', 'elaborate', 'was', 'absolutely', 'Lau', 'most', 'powerful', 'performance', 'career', 'way', 'better', 'Days', 'Being', 'Wild', 'Am', 'Sorry', 'Infernal', 'Affairs', '2', 'Anyways', 'let', 'get', 'back', 'Happy', 'Together.Tony', 'Leslie', 'characters', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'happy', 'together', 'had', 'more', 'happiness', 'movie', 'Perhaps', 'even', 'going', 'Argentina', 'exile', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'things', 'back', 'way', 'were', 'few', 'irreconcilable', 'differences', 'two', 'Tony', 'hard', 'working', 'down-to-earth', 'monogamous', 'Leslie', 'lazy', 'rebelious', 'sexually', 'promiscuous', 'broke', 'up', 'inevitably', 'Leslie', 'would', 'say', 'Let', 'start', 'again', 'Tony', 'lost', 'faith', 'Leslie', 'just', 'move', 'on.Then', 'Leslie', 'became', 'self-destructive', 'body', 'living', 'was', 'very', 'emtionally', 'impacting', 'see', 'Leslie', 'cry', 'heart', 'out', 'when', 'realized', 'Tony', 'life', 'Tony', 'drove', 'waterfall', 'stared', 'thinking', 'Leslie', 'was', 'visually', 'stunning', 'Tony', 'co-worker', 'played', 'Chang', 'Chen', 'was', 'secretly', 'love', 'Tony', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'room', 'heart', 'anyone', 'decided', 'abandon', 'Leslie', 'return', 'Hong', 'Kong.The', 'love', 'scene', 'was', 'pretty', 'convincing', 'guessed', 'Leslie', 'must', 'have', 'helped', 'Tony', 'get', 'character', 'gave', 'career', 'best', 'performances', 'Tony', 'more', 'screen', 'time.The', 'cinematography', 'soundtrack', 'art', 'direction', 'WKW', 'direction', 'are', 'perfect', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'gay', 'enjoy', 'film', 'trully', 'beautiful']",Happy Together VHS
