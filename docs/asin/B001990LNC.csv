Though it is so easy to download the episodes, the enjoyment of owning them is difficult to describe. It is also difficult to ""star rate"" a series before its formal/official release.Picket Fences - Season 2Come on Amazon, how much longer must we wait to watch our favourite Sheriff Brock and his team in action??Moreover, giving this series a 5 star rating is in my view, unjustified no matter what people may feel, since Series 2 - 4 have not been released on DVDs.

1162054,A1WDJVFW11HT48,B001990LNC,Mr. Alan Chivers,"[27, 28]","Having released complete DVD collections of the David E. Kelley classic signature gems ""Boston Legal"" and ""Ally McBeal"" during the past six months, I am so seriously hoping that Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment re-opens the vaults to that small-town wonder ""Picket Fences"".  Every Friday night at 9.30 on Network Ten, here in Australia, I would bathe in its warm glow of compelling drama and delightful eccentricity.  The stories coming out of Rome, Wisconsin often touched on headline events and issues concerning small towns, nations, and the world of its time - making it the perfect 1990s time capsule, and yet, a timeless classic.  Please TCFHE!!!! Please consider a DVD release of Seasons 2 - 4.  And, with a Season 3 release which contains the Picket Fences/Chicago Hope crossover episode ""Rebels With Causes"", perhaps I should also add that I am absolutely in favour of a Complete First Season DVD release of ""Chicago Hope"".",5,'tis the season to be releasing some more David E.
