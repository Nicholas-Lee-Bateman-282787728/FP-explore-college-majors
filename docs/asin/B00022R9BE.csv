With all the dramas unfolding around Lance Armstrong it is something to remind us that acts of individual integrity are often not seen on the public stage but go on unseen on the frozen roads of training or dark recesses of our mind unravelling. It is a gritty and inspiring telling of the psyche of professional sport and mental health. It had elements of ""The World's Fastest Indian"" in that it shows there is room in the world for those who will do it their way, against the mainstream and odds because they have a belief and are driven to do so. It is a great movie and I recommend it highly, even for non sport or cycling fans-its human drama at its best.

As a recreational cyclist, and having trained hard and at least attempted racing, I knew that I would enjoy a film which focused on the life of a real athlete - rather than a fictional styling (Breaking Away) or one race (Hell On Wheels).With 50% Scot blood in my veins I felt at home with the voices and scenery, but I found myself quickly intensely involved with the characters and swept away by the quality of the cinematography and the stunning surround sound. I've pre-ordered the DVD - but this is the very definition of big screen cinema entertainment.In the late night screening I was lucky to have a whole row to myself - so no one witnessed my emotional gasps, or the times during the races when I was literally shaking with excitement.I loved the way that Graeme's struggle with manic depression is given respectful depth - especially since his illness was an integral part of what drove him obsessively to achieve. Too few films deal effectively with the stress and reality of being bipolar. We need to see that he is loved, respected and supported as living with a mental illness, but also that he can accept polite active intervention.This is a remarkable story - extremely well told. Full praise to all of the cast - especially Jonny Lee Miller, who looks and lives the part and to Brian Cox, one of Britain's greatest dramatic actors (see ""The Lost Language Of Cranes"").I've read that the film is a more than adequate precis of Graeme's story, so I'm very much looking forward to reading his autobiography as well.",5,one of the most exciting cinema experiences of my 51 years,1188172800,"08 27, 2007",2007,1618,"[""'m"", 'just', 'home', 'enjoying', 'one', 'most', 'exciting', 'cinema', 'experiences', '51', 'years', 'recreational', 'cyclist', 'having', 'trained', 'hard', 'least', 'attempted', 'racing', 'knew', 'would', 'enjoy', 'film', 'focused', 'life', 'real', 'athlete', 'rather', 'fictional', 'styling', 'Breaking', 'Away', 'one', 'race', 'Hell', 'Wheels', '.With', '50', '%', 'Scot', 'blood', 'veins', 'felt', 'home', 'voices', 'scenery', 'found', 'quickly', 'intensely', 'involved', 'characters', 'swept', 'away', 'quality', 'cinematography', 'stunning', 'surround', 'sound', ""'ve"", 'pre-ordered', 'DVD', 'very', 'definition', 'big', 'screen', 'cinema', 'entertainment.In', 'late', 'night', 'screening', 'was', 'lucky', 'have', 'whole', 'row', 'myself', 'so', 'one', 'witnessed', 'emotional', 'gasps', 'times', 'races', 'when', 'was', 'literally', 'shaking', 'excitement.I', 'loved', 'way', 'Graeme', 'struggle', 'manic', 'depression', 'given', 'respectful', 'depth', 'especially', 'illness', 'was', 'integral', 'part', 'what', 'drove', 'obsessively', 'achieve', 'Too', 'few', 'films', 'deal', 'effectively', 'stress', 'reality', 'being', 'bipolar', 'need', 'see', 'loved', 'respected', 'supported', 'living', 'mental', 'illness', 'also', 'can', 'accept', 'polite', 'active', 'intervention.This', 'remarkable', 'story', 'extremely', 'well', 'told', 'Full', 'praise', 'cast', 'especially', 'Jonny', 'Lee', 'Miller', 'who', 'part', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'one', 'Britain', 'greatest', 'dramatic', 'actors', 'see', 'Lost', 'Language', 'Cranes', '.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'film', 'more', 'adequate', 'precis', 'Graeme', 'story', ""'m"", 'very', 'much', 'looking', 'forward', 'reading', 'autobiography', 'as', 'well']",The Flying Scotsman

822022,A3HXSOKQUB7W7S,B00022R9BE,L. David Marquet,"[1, 1]","In 1993 a Scotsman by the name of Graeme Obree rode a bicycle 32.1 miles in a single hour, setting a world record. He had no sponsorship, no coaching, no training. The bike he rode was one he built, using parts cannibalized from his washing machine. He went on to win the world pursuit championship twice and reclaim the one hour record in 1995. And yet, he is little known. This movie documents those events and hopefully will introduce his feats to a much broader audience.This 2006 movie is based on the bookFlying Scotsmanthat Obree wrote in 2005. Capably directed by Douglas Mackinnon (predominantly a TV series director) Jonny Lee Miller plays Obree convincingly. Miller played Oren Goodchild in Aeon Flux but no one watched that. The dirty secret is that Obree has bipolar disorder and is prone to bouts of depression. The movie depicts childhood trauma that may have contributed to his disease.The movie is captivating, suspenseful, and inspirational. One roots for Obree all the way, feeling compassion at his self-sabotaging behaviors.

To achieve his success, Obree had to wage battle against not merely the leaders of the World Cycling Federation - who considered him an upstart and thus did everything they could to try to keep him from competing - but his own personal demons brought on by childhood trauma and clinical depression.This slight but engaging film boasts an intriguing locale, smooth direction by Douglas Mackinnon and endearing performances by Johnny Lee Miller, Billy Boyd, Laura Fraser and Brian Cox.  These serve as effective counterweights to all the sports-underdog, hometown-hero-makes-good cliches inherent in the story.For the movie makes it clear that Obree did indeed become something of a folk hero for the citizens of Scotland, who are often forced to play second-fiddle to their more haughty neighbors to the south.

This excellent movie tells us it is possible to fulfill our potential, even achieve greatness, without money and the support systems it can buy.  With perseverance and love it's possible to pick oneself up again and if need be, yet again.  And to heal.  The horrendous ongoing cost of bullying is made evident by Jonny Lee Milleras sensitive portrayal of Graeme Obree. The bullies who tormented him grew up to be bullies.  We've all met them. What a high cost they extract.The racing scenes are exhilarating.This film was twelve years in the making.
