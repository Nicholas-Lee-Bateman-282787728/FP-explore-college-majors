There were a couple of episodes there.  I liked it, quite a bit surprisingly, so I ordered the entire series for a great deal at Amazon.  The packaging was a nice job.  And the entire series was watchable.  no scratches.  Ordering through Amazon is always a trust worthy source and the free super savings shipping and handling is always a good thing for $25 and over order total.",5,What's new Scooby Doo The complete Series...

TV show. The animation is stellar, the episodes are just laugh out loud hilarious, and the casting is great: Mindy Cohn (Facts of Life, anyone?) plays Velma. The Special Features are awesome, you even get bonus episodes. This has gotta be the best buck I've ever spent, and I won't regret it. I watch this show almost every day, and I don't get tired of it. If you and your whole family are avid SD fans, check out WNSD, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.",5,Jinkies!
