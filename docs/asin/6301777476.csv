265761,A2ELNJI3RSGP6D,6301777476,A Common Man,"[1, 1]","This is a very entertaining movie presenting the primitive culture of the Bushman in the Kalahari dessert and contrasting it to modern civilization in much of Africa during the 1980s. It also has implications on the origination of evil and crime in society and relates it to increasing technology and inequality.The performances are excellent and the movie moves along at good pace. Although the subject matter is quite serious it is always presented in a humorous fashion. I think everyone will find it interesting, especially the beginning that focuses on the bushman culture and the Kalahari environment. For example they describe the bushman culture as having no laws, no penalties, no punishment, and no concept of personal ownership.The introduction of a Coca Cola bottle, which was thrown from a small plane, creates problems and social chaos in their society. It causes nothing but misery and the tribe determines that the Gods must have been crazy to give it to them. First they try to bury the bottle, but through a strange set of coincidences it is found again. Next they determine that the only way to solve the problem is to walk to the end of the world and throw the bottle off the Earth. Thus begins the adventure of one of the Bushmen into communities in Africa touched by modern society.This is in contrast to the character Miss Kate Thompson who is fleeing a large city of the modern world and desires the peace of a less advanced society. When she arrives in a remote area she is greeted by a researcher monitoring wild game. He is the source of many amusing scenes but the source of his ineptitude is his inability to relate to women. This is in contrast to the harmonious relationships in the tribe of the Bushmen.The catalyst bringing them all together is the chaos of surrounding political upheavals which provides the setting whereby the solution to their problems comes not from advanced civilization but from the bushman.In the end the bushman returns to his world of peace and tranquility which might provide a metaphor for our civilization without sustainable technology and resource use.",5,Profound subject presented in a humorous fashion,1161388800,"10 21, 2006",2006,2116,"['very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'presenting', 'primitive', 'culture', 'Bushman', 'Kalahari', 'dessert', 'contrasting', 'modern', 'civilization', 'much', 'Africa', '1980s', 'also', 'implications', 'origination', 'evil', 'crime', 'society', 'increasing', 'technology', 'inequality.The', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'movie', 'along', 'good', 'pace', 'subject', 'matter', 'quite', 'serious', 'always', 'presented', 'humorous', 'fashion', 'think', 'everyone', 'will', 'find', 'interesting', 'especially', 'beginning', 'bushman', 'culture', 'Kalahari', 'environment', 'example', 'describe', 'bushman', 'culture', 'having', 'laws', 'penalties', 'punishment', 'concept', 'personal', 'ownership.The', 'introduction', 'Coca', 'Cola', 'bottle', 'was', 'thrown', 'small', 'plane', 'problems', 'social', 'chaos', 'society', 'nothing', 'misery', 'tribe', 'Gods', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'crazy', 'give', 'First', 'try', 'bury', 'bottle', 'strange', 'set', 'coincidences', 'found', 'again', 'determine', 'only', 'way', 'solve', 'problem', 'walk', 'end', 'world', 'throw', 'bottle', 'Earth', 'Thus', 'adventure', 'one', 'Bushmen', 'communities', 'Africa', 'touched', 'modern', 'society.This', 'contrast', 'character', 'Miss', 'Kate', 'Thompson', 'who', 'fleeing', 'large', 'city', 'modern', 'world', 'peace', 'less', 'advanced', 'society', 'When', 'remote', 'area', 'greeted', 'researcher', 'monitoring', 'wild', 'game', 'source', 'many', 'amusing', 'scenes', 'source', 'ineptitude', 'inability', 'relate', 'women', 'contrast', 'harmonious', 'relationships', 'tribe', 'Bushmen.The', 'catalyst', 'bringing', 'together', 'chaos', 'surrounding', 'political', 'upheavals', 'setting', 'whereby', 'solution', 'problems', 'not', 'advanced', 'civilization', 'bushman.In', 'end', 'bushman', 'world', 'peace', 'tranquility', 'might', 'provide', 'metaphor', 'civilization', 'sustainable', 'technology', 'resource', 'use']",The Gods Must Be Crazy VHS

The author has obviously spent much time in Africa. Bushman N!xau is simply wonderful, and I love the clicking language he speaks. The rhinos are great too.A small handful of naysayers claimed it oversimplified the Bushmen, but it did the same to the whites, so who cares? It's great fun.

Having an idea of what to expect in The Gods Must Be Crazy, I wasn't imagining how crazy the movie would become. Of course, it's all in a good fun. I love the story and the ingeniousness of it all. Jamie Uys constantly uses the same zoom-in and zoom-out feature throughout the entire picture, but guess what? It is pretty good and effective. Also, included is the rapid speeding of frames which worked well to his effect. That's why The Gods Must Be Crazy has a great pacing. It's a total opposite of a typical boring Chaplin picture: lots of slapsticks yet with meaning. The film is so simple that it becomes intelligent in so many ways. I loved the cast of unknowns; that is an outstanding work by Marius Weyers, N!xau, and Michael Thys. I know the genre of the picture is meant to be comedy, but I find it to be enlightening on an educational level with some subtle comedy thrown in. The cinematography is a must see.

265775,A1B4NBFZJY2FIZ,6301777476,Chris Fung,"[32, 113]","I know a lot of people are not going to like this review but it just has to be said.  This movie's view of the Zhun/wasi people of the Kalahari Desert-also known as the !Kung San (the term ""Bushman"" so beloved of South Africans of a certain age and color is considered racist and patronizing) and of black people in general is typical of the kind of ""let's laugh at the Negroes"" kind of minstrel show that Spike Lee satirizes in Bamboozled.The premise of this movie is that there are primitive people out there in ""Africa"" who have never seen modern society.  So we can use them as foils to poke fun at ""us"" while at the same time congratulating ourselves on our own cleverness and ability to laugh at ourselves. In making this kind of a movie this you have to have a straight guy, a nave childlike character who wanders through the movie unwittingly showing up the cruelties of the world.The candidate for this job goes to the Zhun/wa hunter N!au, and we can kid ourselves that this is not a racist film because urban blacks are ridiculed as much (if not more so), than the few whites shown directly in the movie.  Excuse me?The movie itself subtly recreates the notion that black people are child-like innocents or corrupt and incompetent shufflers and jivers.  In the absence of any three-dimensional Africans at the movies (how many of you have seen the work of Cheikh Omar Cissoko for example?), we are free to carry on believing that only white people have a clear vision of reality in ""Africa"" or anywhere else in the  world.It may interest viewers to know that the Zhun/wasi recruited by the South African film company which made TGMBC were people who were forced into a South African-run government village after they were forced off their ancestral lands to make way for a game park for tourists.  As Richard Lee's wonderful film &quot;N!ai&quot; makes clear, the people living in these camps were forced to live in poverty and hunger, forbidden from hunting, they were wracked by disease, alcoholism, violence and discord and vaguley administered by SA government officials who thought of them as chlidren.  Young Zhun/wa men were actively recruited into the South African army as trackers to combat SWAPO the black liberation organization operating in this border region of the former South African Reich.By contrast, this movie presents us with a picture of some rural, unspoiled Africa full of Candide-like innocents who are (ultimately) unable to deal with the modern world and so exist as ""pastoral savages"" of the kind so beloved by urban tourists.

Hamlow,"[61, 65]","While the Kalahari Desert looks like a paradise, it's the most treacherous desert in the world, where there is no water for nine of the twelve months of the year.  Much of the first twenty or so minutes is spent documentary-style, contrasting the lifestyles between the ""pretty, dainty, small, and graceful"" Bushmen and ""civilized"" man.  They've adapted to their environment.  There's no sense of ownership--what's there to own?--and wood is the hardest thing there.  There's also no crime, punishment, violence, laws, police, judges, rules, or bosses.  It sounds like a utopia.  Compare that with ""civilized man"", who adapts his environment to suit him, builds power lines to run his labour-saving devices and didn't know where to stop.  More improvements mean more complications, which is why all of us are sentenced to twelve years at school to survive in this complex habitat.So when a Coke bottle tossed from an airplane is found by Xi, a Bushmen, it disrupts their concept of the gods giving them good and useful things, as clearly, there wasn't enough of those given them.  Xi, played by real Bushmen (N!xau) sets out to get rid of the bottle.In Botswana, there's biologist Andrew Steyn who's assigned to pick up Kate Thompson, a reporter who's tired of the rat race in Pretoria and decides to become a teacher in Botswana.  Comedic disaster results in two forms.  One is Steyn's becoming a complete bumbler around beautiful women, and the blonde Kate is quite a looker.  The other involves his driving a land rover, dubbed by his African friend Mpudi as the anti-christ, as there's nothing but trouble with this vehicle.  Mpudi's cursing at the rover is funny.  Needless to say, calamity results on her first day with him.And a band of armed terrorists led by the bearded Sam Boja make their way from the republic of Burani (fictional, of course) down to Botswana.  The seriousness is lightened by two of his members, who when they aren't shooting their automatics, are busy playing cards.Some comedic moments involve repeated lines.  Steyn's chosen one is ""Ai yai yai!"" at some predicament. However, a lot of comedy involves people out of their element, i.e. Steyn with women, Kate in the wild, and of course Xi far away from the Kalahari and his simple ways--or a real laugh, see him trying to drive the anti-christ.I would say this is a one-of-a-kind film, but there was a sequel that followed four years later.  Jamie Uys, who produced and directed the film, has a small cameo in the beginning as the reverend who asks Steyn to go pick up Ms. Thompson.  The fastly-run film harkens to the old silent slapstick comedies.So remember, Monday morning at 8:00 AM, when everyone has to look busy, think of the pit we dug ourselves in, and think how simple those bushmen have it, take a page from Steyn and say ""Ai yai yai!"" because the gods, i.e. us people, must be crazy.",5,Man must be crazy not to see this,1061596800,"08 23, 2003",2003,2878,"['Kalahari', 'Desert', 'paradise', 'most', 'treacherous', 'desert', 'world', 'where', 'water', 'nine', 'twelve', 'months', 'year', 'Much', 'first', 'twenty', 'so', 'minutes', 'spent', 'documentary-style', 'contrasting', 'lifestyles', 'pretty', 'dainty', 'small', 'graceful', 'Bushmen', 'civilized', 'man', ""'ve"", 'adapted', 'environment', 'sense', 'ownership', 'what', 'there', 'own', 'wood', 'hardest', 'thing', 'there', 'also', 'crime', 'punishment', 'violence', 'laws', 'police', 'judges', 'rules', 'bosses', 'utopia', 'Compare', 'civilized', 'man', 'who', 'environment', 'suit', 'power', 'lines', 'run', 'labour-saving', 'devices', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'stop', 'More', 'improvements', 'mean', 'more', 'complications', 'why', 'are', 'sentenced', 'twelve', 'years', 'school', 'survive', 'complex', 'habitat.So', 'when', 'Coke', 'bottle', 'tossed', 'airplane', 'found', 'Xi', 'Bushmen', 'concept', 'gods', 'giving', 'good', 'useful', 'things', 'clearly', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'given', 'Xi', 'played', 'real', 'Bushmen', 'N', 'xau', 'out', 'get', 'rid', 'bottle.In', 'Botswana', 'biologist', 'Andrew', 'Steyn', 'who', 'assigned', 'pick', 'up', 'Kate', 'Thompson', 'reporter', 'who', 'tired', 'rat', 'race', 'Pretoria', 'become', 'teacher', 'Botswana', 'Comedic', 'disaster', 'results', 'two', 'forms', 'One', 'Steyn', 'becoming', 'complete', 'bumbler', 'beautiful', 'women', 'blonde', 'Kate', 'quite', 'looker', 'other', 'driving', 'land', 'rover', 'dubbed', 'African', 'friend', 'Mpudi', 'anti-christ', 'nothing', 'trouble', 'vehicle', 'Mpudi', 'cursing', 'rover', 'funny', 'Needless', 'say', 'calamity', 'results', 'first', 'day', 'band', 'armed', 'terrorists', 'led', 'bearded', 'Sam', 'Boja', 'make', 'way', 'republic', 'Burani', 'fictional', 'course', 'Botswana', 'seriousness', 'lightened', 'two', 'members', 'who', 'when', 'are', ""n't"", 'shooting', 'automatics', 'are', 'busy', 'playing', 'cards.Some', 'comedic', 'moments', 'involve', 'repeated', 'lines', 'Steyn', 'chosen', 'one', 'Ai', 'yai', 'yai', 'predicament', 'However', 'lot', 'comedy', 'involves', 'people', 'element', 'i.e', 'Steyn', 'women', 'Kate', 'wild', 'course', 'Xi', 'far', 'away', 'Kalahari', 'simple', 'ways', 'real', 'laugh', 'see', 'trying', 'drive', 'anti-christ.I', 'would', 'say', 'one-of-a-kind', 'film', 'there', 'was', 'sequel', 'followed', 'four', 'years', 'later', 'Jamie', 'Uys', 'who', 'produced', 'directed', 'film', 'small', 'cameo', 'beginning', 'reverend', 'who', 'Steyn', 'go', 'pick', 'up', 'Ms.', 'Thompson', 'fastly-run', 'film', 'harkens', 'old', 'silent', 'slapstick', 'comedies.So', 'remember', 'Monday', 'morning', '8:00', 'AM', 'when', 'everyone', 'look', 'busy', 'think', 'pit', 'dug', 'think', 'how', 'simple', 'bushmen', 'have', 'take', 'page', 'Steyn', 'say', 'Ai', 'yai', 'yai', 'gods', 'i.e', 'people', 'must', 'be', 'crazy']",The Gods Must Be Crazy VHS

They find it useful, but as it's the only one, they begin to fight over it, where they'd been only peaceful before. So Xi sets out to return the cursed object to the gods.Meanwhile, a new teacher, Miss Thompson, arrives in Botswana, and is picked up by a scientist, Dr. Steyn, who's both enamoured and nervous around her. And there's a crazy revolutionary running around.All three threads come together as Xi is on his quest.There's humor--Dr. Steyn's difficulties with the land rover they call the anti-christ had me in stitches; action--mostly with the revolutionaries and the authorities trying to catch them; and romance--a very sweet romantic triangle with Miss Thompson caught between the earnest but tongue-tied Dr. Steyn and the slick bus-driving tour guide. The Gods Must Be Crazy is also part nature documentary on the Kalahari, and part sociological study.The clash of cultures provides most of the humor and the serious moments--not only between primitive and civilized cultures, but also between men and women. And the narration prompts you to look at things, whether it's a familiar-seeming man making a fool of himself around a beautiful woman, or a bushman not understanding what was wrong with killing and eating a sheep, from the outside, as a scientific study perhaps. Which makes some things even funnier, and others more poignant or even profound.It's a fairly low-budget, amateur-looking film, which only makes it feel more authentic and adds to its charm.The unusual style took a bit of getting used to, but once they did, my husband and kids loved this as much as I did.",5,funny and thought-provoking,1227052800,"11 19, 2008",2008,1695,"['Coke', 'bottle', 'airplane', 'found', 'Xi', 'bushman', 'who', 'back', 'family', 'find', 'useful', 'only', 'one', 'begin', 'fight', 'where', ""'d"", 'been', 'only', 'peaceful', 'before', 'Xi', 'sets', 'out', 'return', 'cursed', 'object', 'gods.Meanwhile', 'new', 'teacher', 'Miss', 'Thompson', 'Botswana', 'picked', 'up', 'scientist', 'Dr.', 'Steyn', 'who', 'enamoured', 'nervous', 'crazy', 'revolutionary', 'running', 'around.All', 'three', 'threads', 'come', 'together', 'Xi', 'quest.There', 'humor', 'Dr.', 'Steyn', 'difficulties', 'land', 'rover', 'call', 'anti-christ', 'had', 'stitches', 'action', 'mostly', 'revolutionaries', 'authorities', 'trying', 'catch', 'romance', 'very', 'sweet', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'Miss', 'Thompson', 'caught', 'earnest', 'tongue-tied', 'Dr.', 'Steyn', 'slick', 'bus-driving', 'tour', 'guide', 'Gods', 'Must', 'Be', 'Crazy', 'also', 'part', 'nature', 'documentary', 'Kalahari', 'part', 'sociological', 'study.The', 'clash', 'cultures', 'most', 'humor', 'serious', 'moments', 'not', 'only', 'primitive', 'civilized', 'cultures', 'also', 'men', 'women', 'narration', 'look', 'things', 'familiar-seeming', 'man', 'making', 'fool', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'bushman', 'not', 'understanding', 'what', 'was', 'wrong', 'killing', 'eating', 'sheep', 'outside', 'scientific', 'study', 'perhaps', 'Which', 'things', 'even', 'funnier', 'others', 'more', 'poignant', 'even', 'profound.It', 'fairly', 'low-budget', 'amateur-looking', 'film', 'only', 'feel', 'more', 'authentic', 'charm.The', 'unusual', 'style', 'took', 'bit', 'getting', 'used', 'once', 'did', 'husband', 'kids', 'loved', 'as', 'much', 'did']",The Gods Must Be Crazy VHS

265782,AC4Z26E60FBEM,6301777476,Fr. Charles Erlandson,"[0, 0]","""The Gods Must Be Crazy"" is a warm and unique film (that is, unless you count ""The Gods Must Be Crazy 2""!) in which the Bushmen of the Kalahari cross paths with the modern world. The result is a blend of subtle humor, as well as a commentary on culture and civilization. While the contrast between the ""perfect"" world of the Bushmen and that of ""evil"" modern culture is overdone in the movie, it does give one pause to think about some of the ways in which we've got things wrong.But more important than the implied cultural commentary are the characters themselves. Xi, the Bushman who is the main character, comes across as an earnest, likeable, and honorable man. And the biologist Andrew Steyn is portrayed as a gentle, unassuming hero - the kind one rarely finds in Hollywood movies. It's great to have a bumbling, good-hearted, competent guy actually be a hero for a change.Several stories intertwine throughout the movie, but at the heart is the story of Xi, whose tribe has discovered a discarded Coke bottle. The Coke bottle turns out to be the most amazing discovery of the Bushmen's lives, as well as the hardest thing they've ever felt. They use it in a variety of ways to improve their lives, but its uniqueness becomes a problem, creating envy and anger where there was none before. Seeing the evil consequence for his people, Xi nobly sets out to get rid of ""The Evil Thing"" by throwing it off the end of the world. As he seeks to dispose of ""The Evil Thing"" Xi's story crosses paths with the stories of Steyn and a reporter turned teacher named Kate Thompson, as well as a revolutionary and his band who are fleeing from the government.The film has many highlights, in addition to the scenes with the Coke bottle, and the humor than ensues from Steyn's bumbling nature when around Kate Thompson provides a lot of the humor of the film. Because of some scenes involving people being shot by guns, as well as some of the language, I can't recommend the movie for the whole family. But it is a great family film in general: it's just not intended for young kids.

It tells the story of a Bushman in the Kalahari who decides to rid his idyllic tribe of the one thing that causes them strife - a coke bottle tossed from a passing airplane. He sets off to throw it off the edge of the world, and instead finds himself in prison for shooting a goat. He is rescued by a bumbling naturalist and his mechanic sidekick, who then set out to save a schoolteacher and her class from a group of terrorists. The obvious message is that the ""primitive"" Bushmen are much more civilized in their own way than anyone the modern world. Some critics may complain of this idealized, paternalistic view of the Bushmen. Looking at the film now, this seems a rather strange comedy in its use of sped-up footage, silent-movie cornball music, and cheaply dubbed-over voices that barely match the lips of the speakers.

It starts with what seems like an anthropology lesson about the Bushmen when a helicopter pilot drops a Coca Cola bottle.  The Bushmen start to worship this new object which has fallen from the sky. Soon, it creates fighting and rivalry among the people.  And so the leader of the group starts a journey to drop it off the end of the world.  I found this part funny and interesting.  I even laughed out loud a little bit.From there, however, it was downhill all the way.  Two other stories were introduced.  One was about an African political war.  The other was a romance between a schoolteacher and a scientist.  These interweaving stories didn't connect until the end.  But by that time I was tired of watching.

Then again, the early 80's, when this movie was made, made little sense in general.To return to the film though, my favorite story surrounds the awkward Englishman named Andrew Steyn, who is a self-proclaimed, and clearly demonstrated, disaster with women.  A woman named Kate Thompson, sick of the city, decides to go teach in Africa and that's how she meets Andrew and that, in my opinion and not the bottle dropping, is when the fun begins.My only complaints would be first that the film is old and does not always transition well, particularly in relation to the filmmaking.

This is a very enjoyable movie.,5,Original,1220745600,"09 7, 2008",2008,465,"['THis', 'movie', 'average', 'rating', '5', 'stars', 'Why', 'big', 'budget', 'big', 'name', 'actors', 'Was', 'over', 'hyped', 'reason', 'everyone', 'movie', 'orignal', 'easy', 'follow', 'Watching', 'movie', 'getting', 'caught', 'up', 'story', 'letting', 'go', 'real', 'world', 'couple', 'hours', 'What', 'simple', 'idea', 'someone', 'coke', 'bottle', 'airplane', 'someone', 'life', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie']",The Gods Must Be Crazy VHS
