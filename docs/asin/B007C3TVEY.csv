She has become, perhaps, the British equivalent of Meryl Streep, and is nearly as synonymous with great acting.  Here it is the same situation (Notice she and John C. Reilly are in an indie vehicle--hardly destined for blockbuster status.)  except perhaps her understated performance is a modesty that is meant to highlight the subject matter rather than her acting ability.  The topic unfolds as a family drama should with no more to say about it here than a teenage tragedy is revealed.  Director Lynne Ramsey's adapted screenplay, and, especially, her directing (as well as Joe Bini's editing) play as much front and center as the title character by giving us a story and a scattered time-frame, which isn't just present an artsy, random hodge-podge, but a real medium of unveiling a dreadful situation.  Perhaps adding or lacking psychoanalysis or soul searching, the point may be that there is no point.  Perhaps the whole film experience is meant to show a vacuum that exists that's meant to be filled in by all of us.",4,Tragic Roots,1375056000,"07 29, 2013",2013,1121,"['often', 'go', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'movie', 'idea', ""'ll"", 'give', 'acting', 'clinic', 'become', 'perhaps', 'British', 'equivalent', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'nearly', 'as', 'synonymous', 'great', 'acting', 'Here', 'same', 'situation', 'Notice', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'are', 'indie', 'vehicle', 'hardly', 'destined', 'blockbuster', 'status', 'perhaps', 'understated', 'performance', 'modesty', 'meant', 'highlight', 'subject', 'matter', 'rather', 'acting', 'ability', 'topic', 'family', 'drama', 'should', 'more', 'say', 'here', 'teenage', 'tragedy', 'revealed', 'Director', 'Lynne', 'Ramsey', 'adapted', 'screenplay', 'especially', 'directing', 'as', 'well', 'Joe', 'Bini', 'editing', 'play', 'as', 'much', 'front', 'center', 'title', 'character', 'giving', 'story', 'scattered', 'time-frame', ""n't"", 'just', 'present', 'artsy', 'random', 'hodge-podge', 'real', 'medium', 'unveiling', 'dreadful', 'situation', 'Perhaps', 'adding', 'lacking', 'psychoanalysis', 'soul', 'searching', 'point', 'may', 'be', 'point', 'Perhaps', 'whole', 'film', 'experience', 'meant', 'show', 'vacuum', 'meant', 'be', 'filled']",We Need to Talk About Kevin
1529321,A1VWWTCCFU8EVQ,B007C3TVEY,A Customer,"[3, 5]","I had the anticipation of not knowing anything about this film and I've  been begged by friends to watch and write a bleedingfilms review. I presumed WNTTAK was set in the UK, about an anti establishment grumpy teenager with Tilda Swinton being the class actress ingredient giving this gritty controversial drama a stamp of importance. I was off target. Way off. The film is based on the novel by Lionel Shriver and is directed by the talented Lynne Ramsey. It's edited with flashbacks throughout mixed with the present day. A refreshing experience for the viewer that must have been a bitch to edit!John C. Reilly plays the father, I would have preferred a different unknown actor cast instead. You can believe that Tilda Swinton could be birth mother to actor Ezra Miller, but there is no father and son resemblance. I remember Tilda in Edward II (1991) because my old friend from drama school Steven Waddington played Edward.  Stevie was one of the nicest people I remember at drama school.Tilda Swinton carries this difficult story which is from a mother's perspective. She was brilliant in the 2008 film `Julia'. In this production she gives her best on screen performance and I hope she's proud of it. I love the fact she doesn't do interviews and is removed from the frenzy of gossip media. And I love the fact she doesn't do too much television. If she did TV, she would be a good suggestion for a character similar to Helen Mirren's DCI Jane Tennison. Tilda Swinton shames so many dull and restricted actors that we see repeatedly in film and Television. Her troubled son Kevin, played by Ezra Miller is an understated, excellent performance.So much of this film focuses on Tilda's face, her expressions, her feelings and reactions without any dialogue which is some achievement, not only down to Tilda but also to the Director Lynne Ramsey who certainly knows how to get the best out of her actors. I would have had Tilda's character in the flashbacks wearing more eye make up during happier times, so when we follow her during the present day there is more of a contrast as it's just her hair style that's different and her characters confidence. This film explores a mother and sons relationship, family guilt, self punishment, peoples need for someone to blame. All depressing stuff yes, but what a journey, especially if you don't know how this story rolls.Not reflecting any of the characters in WNTTAK, this film did ignite thoughts about parents from isolated communities alongside selfish trash introducing children into this world without love, care, guidance or simply being there when it matters. People like this are not fit for parental purpose and are responsible for the negative social consequences of their baby churning conveyor belts.The camera work and overall filming of this production is something else. Watching a good film from a director who doesn't have a huge body of work under her belt is so exciting.  Although I am a supporter that less can be more, the brutality in this film could have been slightly more hard hitting or visually challenging, without being too graphic. As it is - any violent acts are avoided which is fine, but the lack of a challenging visual impact can result in slight sympathy for the criminal, because you have not witnessed exactly what they have done. Alternatively, the film makers show you just enough for you to use your imagination. (Visual impact example: The camera just fixed closely on someone's face while they are committing a criminal act can be powerful).Heavy stuff indeed, and much better than I anticipated that's for sure. Make sure you watch this work, it's original, clever and will be talked about for a long time. I just love the scene when mother and son are in the restaurant.

1529326,A2IIC3NBR966LL,B007C3TVEY,antaylor,"[0, 0]","Trying to depict the state of mind of someone who is both emotionally and mentally unstable and suffering from the after effects of a tragic event is very difficult to achieve in a cinematic language but I think Lynne Ramsay has succeeded well here. From the disjointed and fractured chronological order to the arty and surreal tone of the main character's flashbacks and visions, you get a good sense of what it is perhaps this poor mother is going through. Her mind must be all over the place, burdened by guilt and the memories of her horrid time as the mother of her nasty son. The colour red is very prevalent throughout and is something she cannot escape, from the red paint that she is forever scrubbing from her house, hands and car windscreen to the bloodbath she has to bear witness to at the end and which she will forever blame herself. The guilt and living hell will be inescapable.There is always a danger in these kinds of films (and books) that they may not be wholly psychologically accurate and raise more questions than they answer. This film, and I understand the book also, doesn't really attempt to answer the nature vs nurture question in any serious balanced way - and how could we expect it to, that is a realm for science and psychology and something which may take decades before they are able to arrive at a more definitive answer. But art has been this way for millennia, it rarely if ever provides answers to big questions but is more about offering up one's own assumptions or take on these issues and inspiring debate.There is a hint of a suggestion in the film that the mother wasn't quite ecstatic at the idea of being a mother (the scene in the antenatal class where she doesn't seem particularly enthusiastic) but there is never really a suggestion that once the child is born that she is anything but a good mother. The film leans far more towards the suggestion that the child was born bad and there was absolutely nothing the mother could have done about it. We see her trying hard from an early age to bond with Kevin but he seems to somehow despise her and manipulate her emotions even from a very young age - and this is where I question the psychological accuracy? Is it possible for a young toddler under two years old to despise anything and understand how to manipulate emotions in a callous way?And in this respect, we could see the film as simply a story about the fears of parenthood from the viewpoint from someone who is not yet a parent, i.e. what happens if I have a naturally bad child who I cannot control and have a positive effect on...? And so a psychologically accurate definitive account of the nature vs nurture is beside the point but rather a story that tries to represent these fears, however irrational and they may be, is what we are engaging with.",4,A rewarding take on parental fears,1339113600,"06 8, 2012",2012,2814,"['Trying', 'depict', 'state', 'mind', 'someone', 'who', 'emotionally', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'suffering', 'effects', 'tragic', 'event', 'very', 'difficult', 'achieve', 'cinematic', 'language', 'think', 'Lynne', 'Ramsay', 'succeeded', 'well', 'here', 'disjointed', 'fractured', 'chronological', 'order', 'arty', 'surreal', 'tone', 'main', 'character', 'flashbacks', 'visions', 'get', 'good', 'sense', 'what', 'perhaps', 'poor', 'mother', 'going', 'mind', 'must', 'be', 'place', 'burdened', 'guilt', 'memories', 'horrid', 'time', 'mother', 'nasty', 'son', 'colour', 'red', 'very', 'prevalent', 'something', 'can', 'not', 'escape', 'red', 'paint', 'forever', 'scrubbing', 'house', 'hands', 'car', 'windscreen', 'bloodbath', 'bear', 'witness', 'end', 'will', 'forever', 'blame', 'guilt', 'living', 'hell', 'will', 'be', 'inescapable.There', 'always', 'danger', 'kinds', 'films', 'books', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'wholly', 'psychologically', 'accurate', 'raise', 'more', 'questions', 'answer', 'film', 'understand', 'book', 'also', ""n't"", 'really', 'attempt', 'answer', 'nature', 'vs', 'nurture', 'question', 'serious', 'balanced', 'way', 'how', 'could', 'expect', 'realm', 'science', 'psychology', 'something', 'may', 'take', 'decades', 'are', 'able', 'arrive', 'more', 'definitive', 'answer', 'art', 'been', 'way', 'millennia', 'rarely', 'ever', 'answers', 'big', 'questions', 'more', 'offering', 'up', 'one', 'own', 'assumptions', 'take', 'issues', 'inspiring', 'debate.There', 'hint', 'suggestion', 'film', 'mother', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'ecstatic', 'idea', 'being', 'mother', 'scene', 'antenatal', 'class', 'where', ""n't"", 'seem', 'particularly', 'enthusiastic', 'never', 'really', 'suggestion', 'once', 'child', 'born', 'anything', 'good', 'mother', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'towards', 'suggestion', 'child', 'was', 'born', 'bad', 'was', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'mother', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'see', 'trying', 'hard', 'early', 'age', 'bond', 'Kevin', 'somehow', 'despise', 'manipulate', 'emotions', 'even', 'very', 'young', 'age', 'where', 'question', 'psychological', 'accuracy', 'possible', 'young', 'toddler', 'two', 'years', 'old', 'despise', 'anything', 'understand', 'how', 'manipulate', 'emotions', 'callous', 'way', 'respect', 'could', 'see', 'film', 'simply', 'story', 'fears', 'parenthood', 'viewpoint', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'yet', 'parent', 'i.e', 'what', 'have', 'naturally', 'bad', 'child', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'control', 'have', 'positive', 'effect', 'so', 'psychologically', 'accurate', 'definitive', 'account', 'nature', 'vs', 'nurture', 'point', 'rather', 'story', 'represent', 'fears', 'however', 'irrational', 'may', 'be', 'what', 'are', 'engaging']",We Need to Talk About Kevin

Beware of spoilers: I feel sorry for whoever reads any outline before seeing this film.It's made to be seen free of such summaries, as a whodunit where you're clueless and stay that way for its first half hour, possibly longer, while trying to piece together what's going on. Half the joy's in this gradualism, with the clues nicely laid out via a well-chosen collection of odd, sometimes near-incoherent scenes. Despite that mental fog, the direction also manages to get across quite clearly that it will dissipate, as well as that this is no surreal plot but a set of bizarre circumstances warranting the befuddlement, since it fits the plot perfectly.Much about this film is also cringe-worthy, yet it's never a tawdry emotional grab. A horror movie as much as a psychological thriller, it raises issues about nature vs nurture, and whether something beyond parental incapacity makes us tick. No simple answer emerges, so the unfolding is the nub.Tilda Swinton's acting is top-rate, her androgyny perfectly fitting this particular part: in several scenes it compounds the requisite discomfort. She was reportedly nervous about playing a mother without being one. Yet even her way of holding the infant alone speaks volumes, contributing to the visceral impact. Everyone else in the cast is also at least good, albeit never on her level.Ezra Miller, as Kevin, is clearly dealt the weakest hand: scant dialogue and just growling try to pass for character. Surely better could have been scripted for this part, and the director might have considered something subtle, for balance. John C. Reilly, as Swinton's go-with-the-flow husband, is the movie's second weakness. His laconic character verges on absence, and one teeters between considering such obtuseness possible, however implausible, and outright disbelief.Together with Swinton, most aspects of the direction and photography/art direction call for special mention, with the techniques to unravel the plot being especially intriguing. One of those rare films that may send you back to the source novel (by Lionel Shriver) to fill in the lost detail and for another look at the artefact in its original form. It got a Palme d'Or nomination for best film at Cannes, and Tilda Swinton was up for a best actress Golden Globe award.

1529333,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B007C3TVEY,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[25, 29]","The director has taken a very unusual course here.  One that should be applauded.  Instead of trying to film the best selling book, which is also a five star effort, the screenplay recreates the book as a visual form of expression and storytelling.  It is one of the most visual films I've ever seen.  This also would have been a very hard novel to convert to film if you were going to follow it verbatim as it was entirely a series of letters from the wife to the husband after their son Kevin kills a bunch of kids at his high school. Letters are not used at all in the movie.Tilda Swinton as the mother has the lead role by a wide, wide margin here.  The others had a bit wider roles in the book but that's ok.  Swinton does an outstanding job and I am sure come Oscar time she will at the very least be a nominee for lead actress. One aspect conveyed in both the book and the film is that the mother and Kevin not only do not bond when he is young, but the mother also has a major case of untreated post partum depression for a very long time following his birth.Let's face it, when one of these mass murders happens in a school and the murderer is another kid, we all want to find something wrong with the parents to explain it. So do the people in this exclusive suburb and the mother is a pariah post murders. She gets her face slapped on the street, her house spray painted red, and her groceries ruined in the market, as just a sampling of daily life.  Prior to this, she was a wealthy world adventurer and author but you'd never know it afterwards. I'd say it was unbelievable she didn't change her name and move but the remarkable thing is that the parents in the real life cases do tend to stay put.  Both the Harrises and Klebolds are still in Littleton, Colorado, under the same names, for example.At the very least, one must admit that Kevin is strange. Not everyone can see it, of course, and certainly his father can't at all. Not to put too fine a point on it, he is a pretty disgusting child with absolutely horrendous habits. Many of us would need to be saints in order to parent Kevin. I couldn't do it. Faced with the doting father and this awful kid, I would just get a divorce and gladly give my husband sole custody of Kevin, which he would be only too glad to accept. Although they start moving in that direction when Kevin is in high school, I would have been moving in that direction when he was 3-5 instead.One odd point is that an extremely good looking young man, Ezra Miller, was hired to play Kevin as a teen. I'm not entirely sure that someone this beautiful could ever be easily be reviled by anyone.  History is replete with great beauty seducing the multitudes.  I've seen Miller before on series tv.  I'm always struck by his exquisite alabaster skin, beautiful bone structure, gorgeous hair and eyes.  It is a bit jarring to jump from the creepy little Kevins to Kevin the gorgeous teen. He also has a wonderful voice  No one else seems to notice this extreme attractiveness.  He was as creepy as a teen as he was as a child in the novel, by contrast. Fortunately, he is a good enough actor to convince you something inside is wrong after you get over the initial jarring effect of seeing him.  Ezra Miller is an excellent enough actor  to convince one over the long haul that he is twisted inside despite the beautiful exterior. I think he is a young actor to watch for the future.",5,The Same Yet Different--Novel and Film Each Goes for Own Medium's Strength,1323561600,"12 11, 2011",2011,3421,"['director', 'taken', 'very', 'unusual', 'course', 'here', 'One', 'should', 'be', 'applauded', 'Instead', 'trying', 'film', 'best', 'selling', 'book', 'also', 'five', 'star', 'effort', 'screenplay', 'book', 'visual', 'form', 'expression', 'storytelling', 'one', 'most', 'visual', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'hard', 'novel', 'convert', 'film', 'were', 'going', 'follow', 'verbatim', 'was', 'entirely', 'series', 'letters', 'wife', 'husband', 'son', 'Kevin', 'bunch', 'kids', 'high', 'school', 'Letters', 'are', 'not', 'used', 'movie.Tilda', 'Swinton', 'mother', 'lead', 'role', 'wide', 'wide', 'margin', 'here', 'others', 'had', 'bit', 'wider', 'roles', 'book', 'ok.', 'Swinton', 'outstanding', 'job', 'am', 'sure', 'come', 'Oscar', 'time', 'will', 'very', 'least', 'be', 'nominee', 'lead', 'actress', 'One', 'aspect', 'conveyed', 'book', 'film', 'mother', 'Kevin', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'not', 'bond', 'when', 'young', 'mother', 'also', 'major', 'case', 'untreated', 'post', 'partum', 'depression', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'following', 'birth.Let', 'face', 'when', 'one', 'mass', 'murders', 'school', 'murderer', 'kid', 'want', 'find', 'something', 'wrong', 'parents', 'explain', 'So', 'do', 'people', 'exclusive', 'suburb', 'mother', 'pariah', 'post', 'murders', 'face', 'slapped', 'street', 'house', 'spray', 'painted', 'red', 'groceries', 'ruined', 'market', 'just', 'sampling', 'daily', 'life', 'Prior', 'was', 'wealthy', 'world', 'adventurer', 'author', ""'d"", 'never', 'know', ""'d"", 'say', 'was', 'unbelievable', 'did', ""n't"", 'change', 'name', 'move', 'remarkable', 'thing', 'parents', 'real', 'life', 'cases', 'do', 'tend', 'stay', 'put', 'Harrises', 'Klebolds', 'are', 'still', 'Littleton', 'Colorado', 'same', 'names', 'very', 'least', 'one', 'must', 'admit', 'Kevin', 'strange', 'Not', 'everyone', 'can', 'see', 'course', 'certainly', 'father', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Not', 'put', 'too', 'fine', 'point', 'pretty', 'disgusting', 'child', 'absolutely', 'horrendous', 'habits', 'Many', 'would', 'need', 'be', 'saints', 'order', 'parent', 'Kevin', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'Faced', 'doting', 'father', 'awful', 'kid', 'would', 'just', 'get', 'divorce', 'gladly', 'give', 'husband', 'sole', 'custody', 'Kevin', 'would', 'be', 'only', 'too', 'glad', 'accept', 'start', 'moving', 'direction', 'when', 'Kevin', 'high', 'school', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'moving', 'direction', 'when', 'was', '3-5', 'instead.One', 'odd', 'point', 'extremely', 'good', 'looking', 'young', 'man', 'Ezra', 'Miller', 'was', 'hired', 'play', 'Kevin', 'teen', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'someone', 'beautiful', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'easily', 'be', 'reviled', 'anyone', 'History', 'replete', 'great', 'beauty', 'seducing', 'multitudes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Miller', 'series', 'tv', ""'m"", 'always', 'struck', 'exquisite', 'alabaster', 'skin', 'beautiful', 'bone', 'structure', 'gorgeous', 'hair', 'eyes', 'bit', 'jarring', 'jump', 'creepy', 'little', 'Kevins', 'Kevin', 'gorgeous', 'teen', 'also', 'wonderful', 'voice', 'No', 'one', 'else', 'notice', 'extreme', 'attractiveness', 'was', 'as', 'creepy', 'teen', 'was', 'child', 'novel', 'contrast', 'Fortunately', 'good', 'enough', 'actor', 'convince', 'something', 'inside', 'wrong', 'get', 'initial', 'jarring', 'effect', 'seeing', 'Ezra', 'Miller', 'excellent', 'enough', 'actor', 'convince', 'one', 'long', 'haul', 'twisted', 'beautiful', 'exterior', 'think', 'young', 'actor', 'watch', 'future']",We Need to Talk About Kevin

1529339,A13QVQBHH2R1ZB,B007C3TVEY,critical reader,"[0, 1]","Tilda Swinton plays an isolated, depressed woman with painful memories.  Her son, Kevin, was a hostile, difficult child from birth  She was somewhat ambivalent about motherhood, and Kevin's constant, angry crying as a baby and cruel nature as a boy make it even harder for her to bond with him.  Her husband is blissfully ignorant, in part because Kevin is skillful in showing his dad a more pleasant side.  Mother and father also have a later-in-late baby, an affectionate little girl who is nothing like her older brother.Kevin's calculating hostility culminates in a horrifying event that is slowly revealed in flashbacks.We never get an explanation of why Kevin is so hateful, and the parents never really try to get help (in fact, the dad denies anything is wrong).  Perhaps that was the intended point - that sometimes there is no explanation, sometimes people are just born bad.  However, the film hints that maybe it's because the mother didn't immediately bond with baby Kevin even though she tried (an offensive and insidious message - and Kevin's dad doting on him doesn't make him a nicer person).  It's unclear if we're supposed to blame her, or if the mom is simply blaming herself.The acting was great, but I'm not sure what I was supposed to get out of this film.  It was a hopeless little slice of hell.

1529340,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B007C3TVEY,DanD,"[0, 0]","Movies about violent teenagers are a dime a dozen; very few have any real depth to them.  They tend to seek answers, or revel in the rebelliousness, or simply aim to shock.  Lynne Ramsay's WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN, initial appearances notwithstanding, does not fit into this mold.  It is dark, yes--some of the imagery is disturbing, some of the cuts are hectic, but the intent/result is psychological, not visceral.  And the story is told in a nonlinear fashion; we don't even find out what Kevin did until the film's end, though we know it isn't good.  The technique, on behalf of screenwriter/director Ramsay, is effectively jarring: this is not an easy film to watch.The story focuses on Eva (a haunting Tilda Swinton, giving an award-worthy performance), following her inner turmoil as she copes with the fact that she doesn't feel comfortable around her son (the maternal instinct is a target here, which adds to the element of discomfort).  Eva is human; this means she's not an entirely sympathetic character (in fact, I'll admit to absolutely loathing her in spots, which was the filmmakers' intent).  In fact, there are no truly sympathetic characters here: John. C. Reilly, as Kevin's father, does his nice guy thing, but with an edge: after all, he encourages some of his son's more violent behaviors.  The three actors playing Kevin at different ages (Rock Duer, Jaspar Newell, and Ezra Miller) are all fantastic, conveying Kevin as an almost despicable character.  (If the film has one major flaw, it's that younger Kevin comes across almost as preternaturally evil; while this is indeed left up in the air, there are several attempts to suggest that Kevin's actions are a result of his parenting, but this only really comes across--in the character anyways--with Miller's performance of a teenaged Kevin.)This film will raise a few eyebrows and offend a few viewers; it proposes a lot of questions, presents several possible answers, and then steps back and says, ""Does the answer really matter after the fact?""  It doesn't judge (though it seems to in the first 30 minutes or so); it inhabits a firmly gray area, placing the final verdict in the viewers' hands.  It's certainly not a conventional film; in the ""making of"" doc, one individual describes it as a ""psychological horror"" film, and that term hits the mark, but doesn't quite cover it.

This movie is as stated very disturbing, not in graphic images, but in implied emotions, and happenings.  Potential Spoiler in review.The movie starts out really slow and disjointed, much like the review I am trying to get out.  When it starts it has that artsy European feel to it.  It goes back and forth and is somewhat confusing - stick it out, it gets better.  This is very disturbing subject matter, and I wouldn't recommend anyone under 13 watch it for sure, and maybe older.I think the movie eloquently shows the horror of what a Mother goes through in the after math of a huge tragedy.  Unlike many movies that show you what is to be the obvious victim people care about - this takes on (very well) the less easy to identify with Mother of the Mass Murderer.  What she goes through as she knows there is something wrong with her child, and the aftermath of the tragedy.The casting of Kevin was perfect in all the ages.  It was heartbreaking to watch.  I think this is a movie where 10 people can see it and have completely different views on it.  Some will think it was the mothers fault, others will think Kevin was completely at fault, others will see it as no one caught it.  The interesting thing is not everyone will be able to come to the same conclusion.So my review is I hated this movie because it was so real.  But I loved this movie for making me think and be better able to empathize as a human.  I kind of thought the Mom was always a weirdo, but the more I think on it the more I think there is so much that happened that was not shown.  I kind of thought Mom should have taken the kid to psychiatrist, curious to know what others felt.

1529345,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B007C3TVEY,Doug Park,"[1, 1]","""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" is full of subtleties, uncertainties, and improbabilities. We are told very little about the characters, and what we are shown is often marginal. Examples: I wanted to know more about the family's background, Kevin's condition (antisocial personality disorder or what?), how he interacts (or doesn't) with the other kids at his school, and most importantly, how he manages to commit this improbable crime. Yet, having said this I have to ask, ""What difference would all that have made?"" As Kevin himself states, ""That's the point: There is no point."" Although the minimalism works in the end, fans of traditional film narrative may find this one a bit frustrating. Having seen it, I'm glad I did, but it's not the sort of thing I want to see again any time soon.The whole mood is, as you can imagine, very bleak, and, for lack of a better term, semi-surreal. The dialogue is especially important: e.g., Kevin: ""You can be kind of harsh sometimes""; Eva (his mother): ""You're a fine one to talk."" The physical traits Kevin and Eva share, while Kevin's father and sister share fairer traits, serve to symbolize how Eva is blamed so cruelly for Kevin's crime and the guilt she feels over same. What ""WNTAK"" shows and does not show leaves room for all kinds of interpretations, but I think it shows very effectively how society is cruel to everyone, and everyone learns, often in the hardest possible ways, from it.The first hour or so is erratic and often confusing with all the jumping back and forth in time, but everything comes into sharper focus during the second half of ""WNTAK.""

Van,"[2, 3]","There's no question that this movie is brilliantly made: great to look at and superbly acted, qualities which made it the 15th most mentioned movie in 2011 critics' Top 10 lists. But does it make an ounce of sense in terms of actual human psychology? Fact: there are no children like Kevin, who as an infant behaves like a psychopath when he's with his mother but normally with everyone else, especially his father (which prevents anyone from believing that he's a monster). Fact: the film emphasizes that Eva had severe trouble bonding with Kevin before his psychopathy emerged, strongly suggesting a causal relationship, but that's complete nonsense. Psychopathy is a neurological defect that has nothing to do with the quality of parenting, and to even suggest that it does is a reversion to the days when autism and schizophrenia were blamed on bad mothering. Fact: while there's reason to believe that Eric Harris of Columbine and Andrew Golden (Jonesboro, 1998) were psychopaths, they represent a distinct minority of school shooters, and both recruited accomplices; so the notion of a psychopathic lone school shooter is at best a stretch. Fact: the parents of school shooters have never been ostracized or persecuted by their community (as happens here, and it's a major plot point).So what we have here is a film that *given a sufficient knowledge of psychology* (which clearly is not the case for many critics and fans of critically acclaimed movies) is no more realistic or credible than The Omen. And yet it purports to cast an insightful light on the troubling phenomenon of school shootings. What it's actually doing is exploiting school shootings while portraying them in a thoroughly misleading light.

I really find myself coming down on her side here Kevin is responsible for Kevin's actions not his mother.  Why doesn't she report the actions of the vandals to the police?  Why does she not have some manner of police protection?  Why does she put up with casual assaults on the street?  Why doesn't she just move?

Soon enough Kevin emerges from her womb with an inexplicably preternatural awareness of his mother's prenatal reluctance/indifference/whatever towards him and proceeds to make her life hell for much of the film until his sinister grudge culminates in an atrocity.That is the plot in a nutshell, although the film progresses in a non-linear fashion, no doubt in an attempt to unsettle the viewer so that one feels as bewildered as Eva through these events. The atrocity is referred to obliquely at the film's beginning but it's not difficult to figure out what happened from the barrage of speechless images. From there the first thirty minutes are an unnerving slog. However, once Eva throws Kevin against a wall--does anyone ultimately blame her?!--the film takes a bizarrely comic turn. The father becomes impossibly doting and oblivious as Kevin gets noticeably creepier. And in spite of her paranoia--conveyed, I suppose, by Tilda Swinton's relentless blinking at Kevin's foul-mouthed replies to her every solicitation--Eva reacts with equal indulgence.The film's score constantly wavers between the strumming of a mandarin guitar (which is annoying as hell) or haunted house music or (more aggravating still) various uplifting songs which clash spectacularly with the dreary subject matter.Oh, and is John C.

1529357,A328S9RN3U5M68,B007C3TVEY,Grady Harp,"[34, 37]","In an interview with Lionel Shriver' about her highly successful 2005 novel she commented on the difficulty of the project: `It was admittedly draining. And throughout, I was anxious that because I had never had a child myself, I didn't know what I was talking about and readers who were parents would catch me out.' As adapted for the screen by director Lynne Ramsay and Rory Kinnear this story becomes a terrifyingly realistic exploration of the subject of inherent evil and the manner in which we deal with it.  The film is particularly timely as we read almost daily of youngsters killing classmates in schools across the country. But first the story:Eva Khatchadourian (Tilda Swinton) is trying to piece together her life following the ""incident"". Once a successful travel writer, she is forced to take whatever job comes her way, which of late is as a clerk in a travel agency. She lives a solitary life as people who know about her situation openly shun her, even to the point of violent actions toward her. She, in turn, fosters that solitary life because of the incident, the aftermath of which has turned her into a meek and scared woman. That incident involved her son Kevin Khatchadourian (Ezra Miller as a teenager and Jasper Newell as a 6 year old and Rock Duer as a toddler), who is now approaching his eighteenth birthday. Eva and Kevin have always had a troubled relationship, even when he was an infant. Whatever troubles he saw, Franklin (John C. Reilly), Eva's complacent husband, just attributed it to Kevin being a typical boy. The incident may be seen by both Kevin and Eva as his ultimate act in defiance against his mother.Ramsay tells her story in bits and pieces of a collage of moments from the birth of Kevin to his incarceration.  For some this kind of non-linear story telling may be disconcerting, but for this viewer it seems like a close examination of the mind of a mother who simply cannot believe she has birthed and is raising a child who is the epitome of evil. The fact that we are aware of something hideous that has happened from the beginning does not get in the way of watching the slow maturation of Kevin - first as a constantly screaming infant to a maliciously bad little boy to a viciously cruel and evil teenager with whom his mother cannot connect except for one very telling instance when she reads the young Kevin `Robin Hood' and his arrows, at which point Kevin shows a degree of affection for Eva. That moment proves in retrospect to be the nidus for the horror that lies ahead. Yet to say more about the story wound diminish the impact one the viewer.  Tilda Swinton is extraordinary in her role as is Ezra Miller. The film. At least, for this viewer, is a powerfully disturbing one and a very fine insight into how evil deeds can happen.

In this case, the director's heavy-handed use of cutaways and jumbled chronology drag down an otherwise brilliant film. (I was reminded, both in methodology and in the use of symbolism, of Lars Von Trier's Antichrist, though mercifully without all the gore.) Tilda Swinton is pitch-perfect as the mother of a young sociopath, and the film wisely refrains from pat judgments or tidy explanations as to whether or not her chilly attitude toward her firstborn affects his descent into evil. For a movie about such horrific events, very little violence is shown on-screen, which makes the climax of the film much more terrifying and effective than a simple bloodbath could have done.

It was very difficult to tear my eyes away even though I was trying to multitask and get some work done while watching it. I knew the story yet it was like reliving it all again but on a much deeper level. I felt deeply for Tildas character. It haunted me for days afterwards which the book didn't do as much I suppose it is because we can buffer out minds in a way from what we are reading in a book and imagine it as we want. but the movie doesn't let us do that. It forces us to see the story in a raw way. The only complain I have about the movie is the god awful soundtrack. I understand the person who selected the music, likely the directory, was probably trying to use such simple, old fashioned, creepy ass annoying music to put us into the moms...or kevins head a little better so we felt just as out of control and confused as they did. but I found myself having to mute the movie and turn on CC to keep watching.

It's a story about true, real-life evil in the world. After watching this movie, I was so shaken up I couldn't get up off the couch to turn it off and sat through the entire credits...I was just numb.I consider this a horror movie, but there is no gore and no demons or supernatural monsters.  Just evil manifesting itself through the years...showing signs it's developing...and then finally erupting.I can't remember the last movie that was so thought-provoking.  Tilda Swinton should have won all the acting awards for this one -- and the young boy who plays her son (not the teenager, but the younger version of him), was phenomenal.  If you remember The Omen and how creepy that kid playing Damien was in the original 1970s version...this boy is even more creepy. You just know something is wrong with him, and I found myself almost screaming at the TV for someone to see the signs and stop him before something awful happened.I've always wondered what happens to the parents of evil people after they've been caught -- what are their lives like in the aftermath?

This movie sheds some light on it, and it's truly a new circle of Hell.I highly recommend that you do not watch this movie if you need to wake up early and go to work in the morning.

The kind of horror this is is not the Scream or Friday the 13th variety...it is somber, sober, and plays out slowly...building to the horrible conclusion you know is coming.

Unfortunately, it takes an Oliver Stone turn for the worse. It starts out with the mother covered in what seems like bloody jello and brains rolling in some hippie orgy. It is filmed in flashbacks/flash forwards/flash sideways. It is extremely disjointed and unsettling.It isn't until toward the end of the movie that it levels out and becomes a semi-recognizable story. It is a total train wreck the viewer cannot take their eyes off of. If the director could have taken some ADD medicine, it might have made a great movie. Tilda Swinton carries this disaster as best she can. John C Riley was a surprise. Known for his Will Ferrell movies, it was a shock to see him. He plays a father blind to his son's evil. His character is never truly explored. He just comes across as wanting to be his son's buddy, regardless of the child's behavior. He constantly makes his wife out to be the villain.When Kevin is approximately between five and seven years old. He refuses to potty train and likes to torment his mother by pooping on himself. No matter how hard she works with him, his dead eyes and soul are impenetrable. She loses it, and he exploits her guilt.She finally has a child who is loving and kind which they give the impression makes Kevin physically ill. The interesting dynamic of this film (and where it could have been explored further) is when Kevin is sick and cuddles his mom and rejects the dad. He shows the audience a clue that he knows who truly loves him (tries to love him) and who is a huge part of the problem (the dad).When Kevin hurts the little sister, all the viewer can ask is was why is this kid not in a psych ward??? Ezra Miller plays fifteen year old Kevin. He could have been good, but his character is poorly developed. Granted the story is from the mother's perspective, but there needed to be more between teen Kevin and his mother for one to fully comprehend what the heck is going on.

1529367,A1Y0HX12MCT6OR,B007C3TVEY,I'm Right,"[7, 10]","NOT THE RAMSEYS!We Need to Talk About Kevin is an enganging thriller about an interesting topic I was always curious about, parents raising a clinical psychopath. However We Need to Talk About Kevin is lauded as 'disturbing' when really it's just manipulative, similar to another recent horror film The Woman (where all white males are violent rapists). The start of the film is engaging, as I couldn't really tell why Tilda Swanston was being treated like s*** but as the film feeds you more and more info it becomes more apparent what happened. ALSO similar to the Woman, it gets more blatantly stupid and manipulative as it progresses.Basically Kevin is a clinical sociopath from the start, the symptoms are there but in order for the script to work he has to be allowed to walk all over everyone in order to get away with it, new age parents must be eating this movie up. No one but Tilda Swanston picks up on his behaviors, even from birth Kevin is smart enough only to piss Tilda off and no one else. Even if he was so psychopathic that he was beyond help through meds and therapy the parents could've at least tried those options, but no, Kevin is a brilliant mastermind taking advantage of all the dummies in his life because that level of unrealism is 'disturbing' to some. So let's go over each character in the family and see why they're all wrong, stupid, and poorly written.The Father- Played by John C. Reily (nice to see him doing drama again), the father is an oblivious Fred Flinstone-esque idiot that wants a friend more than a son. He doesn't notice any wrong behaviors about his son who can manipulate him 24/7 for 16 years, and doesn't believe his wife or even address her concerns about Kevin being a sociopath. Also when the daughter goes to the hospital for bleach that was obviously poured into her eye (she wasn't using eyedrops then) he was more concerned about Kevin not feeling guilty than anything else. Bad parenting + poor writing = disturbing.Kevin- Kevin is a super-smart super-manipulative baby genius that has the ability to trick virtually everyone in the world except for his mother. Many times when he's with his dad he'll give an evil glance to Tilda, for no other reason than to show the audience that he's evil. If he was such a manipulative mastermind he wouldn't even need the spiteful glances, he was already doing a good job about ruining his mother's life. The writer/director must envy Kevin a bit since they clearly try to manipulate the audience and are getting away with it. He wasn't such a terribly written character though if you apply his sociopathy to him, however in a work of fiction Kevin is so manipulative/smart that he started from birth.The Mom- And mother of the year Tilda Swanson, who wouldn't know discipline if it hit her like a truck. In multiple, MULTIPLE scenes Kevin will test his mom, talking back to her or breaking something she loves and she just stares at him and goes 'yes dear'. When Kevin goes into her map-room and destroys everything in there, she knows that he did it to spite her, but what does she do? She takes it out on the paint gun in front of him, not slapping the little brat and giving him no dinner that night. Then later in the film after he poured bleach in his sister's eye instead of daddy doofus wondering if Kevin feels guilty, they both should've had him checked out by a psychologist, mabye look into why blood was coming out of the garbage disposal which was around the same time Snuggles the gerbil went missing.So many warning signs are blaring in the parent's faces and yet they take the worst possible decisions regarding their son, both ignoring his problem in their own way. So in that regard, I feel absolutely no sympathy for John C. Reily's fate, nor the hell that Tilda Swanston lived in after everything because she could've prevented it and had her son locked up or medicated years ago, or where she's living at she can just move. The only real victim in the family was the young daughter who was born into a family where the son's a psychopath and the parents are oblivious imbeciles.So yeah, the production values are excellent, the acting is phenominal, the music is strange and eerie, but the decisions the characters made are just downright stupid. It's like watching a family stuck in a room with water filling up, and the door is right behind them to get out but they just ignore that door the whole time, making this movie an overall frustrating experience. Many people have noted that there's no point to this movie, and I'm inclined to agree with them, unless you want to see a movie lightly skim the surface of how a parent copes with dealing with a psychopath for a son. If you want to see a maternal horror movie, watch Rosemary's Baby, if you want a more realistic and less stupid portrayl of psychopaths, look into Snowtown, and if you want to see this overall story done better, watch The Omen.",2,Aaaaand the parents of the year goes to...,1339027200,"06 7, 2012",2012,4924,"['NOT', 'THE', 'RAMSEYS', 'Need', 'Talk', 'Kevin', 'enganging', 'thriller', 'interesting',

1529369,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B007C3TVEY,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[2, 2]","Lynne Ramsay's WE NEED TO TALL ABOUT KEVIN is a very unique film experience, and not just in how unsettling the film is, but because of its deft storytelling, terrific directorial style and a tremendous performace by the great Tilda Swinton. Basically, the film is a disjointed and disorienting narrative about Eva (Swinton), the mother of Kevin (who is seen as a young child and then as a teen played by a mesmerizing Ezra Miller) and her husband (a too-paternal John C. Reilly) and the events that tear them all apart in the most horrific way possible. As the film opens, we see Eva in the middle of a massive tomato festival where tomatoes are being hurled around and bathing each person in the crowd in red. Next we see Eva awaking some years later to more red. Her small dumpy house and car have both been vandalized with red paint. This is a visual motif that continues throughout the film and is used to great advantage that Eva is constantly bathed in red, whether surrounded by or lighted by the color.We go back and forth in time to see Eva with her new husband Franklin, a burly and jocular man throughout. They're happy in each other and in their wealth, and then they have their first child Kevin. We see a moment just after the delivery when Francis is cradling and cuddling the newborn, and Eva sits there motionless and expressionless. This is a key moment in the film of things to come between what ultimately dominates the story, which is that of the relationship between Eva and Kevin. As a baby, she seems to resent his presence. As he grows, she seems to resent him more and grow increasingly frustrated with him, and there is a moment of shocking physical abuse, which while being partially an accident, remains abuse nonetheless, but Kevin lies to hide his mother's culpability in this. These moments are interspersed with more glimpses of the future to come of tears and pain, and also Eva's present, which is seeing her older and obviously much more worn down by life. She is also a pariah. In an early scene, she is assaulted in broad daylight by another woman and when a witness of this assault comes to her aid, Eva denies any help, claiming that it was her fault, and in some ways, she's right.What we as the audience are manuvered through here in this film is a mystery. What exactly happened to bring this attractive, wealthy and intelligent woman down to a woman who seems to be devoid of anything resembling happiness, wealth and why is she so hated in this community? When we first see her with Kevin, we see a woman who feels none of the natural maternal bond that one is supposed to feel with their child. We also see a child who is either responding to that lack of a bond, or a child who is already set on the road to becoming a psychopath. The mystery is in the unraveling of the events that lead to an emotionally terrifying climax, but smartly Ramsay keeps the more visceral parts to a minimum.The idea of Eva being drenched in red throughout the film, whether from the paint, the lights outside a hotel window, the blinking of a digital clock or hiding in a grocery store against shelves of tomato sauce is obviously very deliberate since we are looking at a woman who sees her own hands as that of a modern Lady MacBeth; she has, from her own anger and disappointment and displeasure for her son, forged someone lethal and unable to form any real human emotions potentially because of the disconnect between them.From a performance standpoint, Swinton is flawless as Eva. She always keeps the audience on their toes as to how to feel about her. It's a very complex character and our judgments about her are equally complex from the way that she plays it. Is she somehow as monstrous as he is? Since we only really see hints of her other relationships, most of her moments as far as with the family are with Kevin, and there is a resentment and a perhaps an absence of any connection with her son almost immediately; does Kevin somehow feed off of that and learn from their dynamic? Ezra Miller plays Kevin as a somewhat classical ""textbook"" psychopath; he has an air of superiority about himself, particularly with Eva. All of his emotional reactions seem to play somewhat falsely to her, if not immediately. But still there's an intensity of purpose in his glare and his constantly cocked head as if he's looking to understand what other's are feeling and see if he can duplicate it. Reilly honestly doesn't have much to do here other than be the nay-sayer who explains away all of Eva's concerns about Kevin as if there's nothing to worry about. This is a shame, because Reilly can be a pretty extraordinary dramatic actor and not just as a comic tool, as seen in some of Paul Thomas Anderson's work, and most recently in Roman Polanski's CARNAGE.Lynne Ramsay has a wonderful sense of style to her direction, and she wisely uses her palette and she wisely works more with implication than outright observation. Knowing the novel from Lionel Shriver, she has taken something that would have been controversial simply for its subject matter and instead of playing at that angle, she pulls us into the film for the way in which it handles the characters. A lesser director would not have done the same.The main reason I don't think this deserves a perfect review is while I understand that there is a good deal of unreality in the situations of this film, I find certain things and certain reactions difficult to believe. The film is highly stylized in a sort of hyper-realism, and perhaps I'm not seeing it for how it was created and more what I felt belonged.Still, WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN is bound to affect people for years to come, and thanks to Ramsay's direction and the performances of Swinton and Miller, it's certainly one of the most unsettling films I've seen in years.",4,One of the most unsettling film

1529375,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B007C3TVEY,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[4, 5]","We Need to Talk About Kevin, based on the novel by Lionel Shriver, is more startling and horrifying than any modern horror film from any recent year, despite being categorized as a drama. I hope I'm not spoiling anything by saying that the story shares narrow similarities with another 2011 drama called Beautiful Boy, a film that showed parents dealing with grief and guilt after their son massacres his school. I expected the two films to be similar, but all similarities stop there. While Beautiful Boy was a gentle, powerful film, it doesn't hold a candle to the psychological trauma delivered by this; it's less glossy and almost immediately more affecting. This is the third film by Scottish film director Lynne Ramsay, who has met with acclaim for her previous films but has never made a film with this much impact on critics and audiences. We Need to Talk About Kevin is still far from being widely seen, but you'll gather from the reviews that those who have seen it have struggled to shake it from their mind. This is not an easy film to watch, but it's unforgettable once you have.Promotional materials, reviews, and synopses have made no secret that Kevin will ultimately commit a massacre at his school, yet this still feels like a minor spoiler. Even if you're aware of this, you won't be prepared for exactly what happens and I urge you to avoid anything that fully discloses the details. The film unfolds with a fragmented timeline, all over the place in terms of chronology. When we first meet Eva (Tilda Swinton), her home and car have been vandalized with red paint. Her neighbors and nearly everyone she encounters are cold to her, if not outright vitriolic. She's assaulted by a random woman on the street only minutes after getting a job at a small travel agency. As she tries to cope, we see her life in flashbacks, beginning with when she met Franklin (John C. Reilly) and became pregnant unexpectedly. When Kevin is born, there's a strong implication that Eva didn't want him and was indifferent to his birth. There's also the implication that Kevin may have been born evil, crying incessantly as a baby and exhibiting sociopathic tendencies and a distinct detachment from his mother as he grows older. Eva is disturbed by this, but unable to find someone to relate as Franklin is oblivious to Kevin's ways.Kevin is portrayed as a toddler, a young child, and a teenager by three different actors with the former two giving some of the best onscreen performances by a child I can readily recall. Rock Duer has little dialogue as the toddler Kevin, but his evil stare gives the film one of its most chilling moments. It's difficult for a child actor to give such a vacant stare without seeming laughable, but Duer just seethes evil in this scene. Jasper Newell as the younger Kevin has more screen time and makes Ezra Miller's eventual transition to teenager Kevin more easily believable. Both Duer and Newell deserve special recognition for how memorably creepy they inhabit these roles, making Kevin one of the most sinister children ever portrayed onscreen. More effective yet is that they're playing a human, where the typical sinister child of filmdom ends up being the antichrist or a victim of Satanic possession. We'll get to Ezra Miller later.Where Beautiful Boy was more linear, dealing with the parents more than the child in a more accessible fashion, We Need to Talk About Kevin is the more thought-provoking, haunting, and ultimately profound film in the way it deals with Eva and Kevin's relationship, tapping deeper into the psychology of both characters. In typical indie-fashion, it doesn't spoon-feed anything and the psychological nature is kept sufficiently ambiguous to provoke discussion. One of the most revealing conversations in the film comes when Eva tells Kevin that she's expecting another child. ""You'll like it,"" she assures him. ""What if I don't like it?"" he asks. ""You'll get used to it."" ""Getting used to it doesn't mean you'll like it. You're used to me."" This is heavy dialogue for such a young actor to deliver and Newell's naturalism makes it one of the most powerful moments in the film.Ezra Miller gives a powerful, genuinely scary performance as the teenaged Kevin. A relative newcomer with gorgeously sculpted features and piercing eyes, he'll be a household name if he continues choosing notable roles. This performance isn't filled with teenage angst, but pure apathy and evil, an uncommonly scary and pitch-perfect performance, especially for such a new actor. He deserves Academy recognition, as he makes Kevin one of the best onscreen psychopaths since Hannibal Lecter. Reilly takes a backseat to Swinton and Miller, but he's more potent than he was in Carnage, his other dramatic role of note in 2011. As for Swinton, they should've handed her the Academy Award as I didn't personally see a better performance by an actress last year. It's a soul-baring, yet understated and remarkably nuanced performance that covers a lot of emotional ground and provides us a thorough rendering of an emotionally complicated character. Swinton is already an Oscar winner (for Michael Clayton), but this blows that performance out of the water. There is no flamboyant ""acting moment"" that allows her to go for maximum emotional effect and get people to take notice. She handles this role with complete subtlety and grace, yet it's earth-shattering.Ramsay has a firm grasp on the film's tone. Along with Jonny Greenwood serving as the composer of the score, Ramsay incorporates some very innocent-sounding songs into a frightening context, a move which parallels the character of Kevin. This is only one of the impressive creative flourishes, with the color red serving as a nightmarish motif that's just as ambiguous as some of the motives of the characters. Ramsay pulls no punches as a filmmaker and We Need to Talk About Kevin is a harsh film that avoids sugarcoating or sensationalizing the subject matter. It also doesn't make it easy for us to choose a place to invest our empathy. It naturally draws our attention to the inherent evil within Kevin and thoroughly shows his lack of empathy from a young age, meanwhile showing Eva as a woman doing her best raising him despite not having strong maternal feelings. At the same time, the film forces us to consider that Kevin is a child and Eva is a rather selfish parent. The aftermath that she deals with evokes empathy certainly, but the film poses a lot of moral questions for the audience. Was Kevin born evil? Or did his mother's indifference towards his life cause him to develop an indifference towards the lives of others? Why is she the one who is ultimately punished, yet spared by Kevin?It's profoundly thought-provoking, going more in-depth showing possible scenarios that lead to the ultimate tragedy without giving a definitive answer that can't possibly exist. The final scene is a cinematic stranglehold that does the best job of any film on this subject illustrating the lack of conclusion anyone is able to come to about why this massacre occurred. It's this moment that really nails down what other films have tried and failed to explore; that ultimately, nothing can be said about it. It has more finality than the ambiguous way Gus San Sant tried to make this same statement in Elephant, but I think it ultimately leaves more questions for us.We Need to Talk About Kevin is a dark, absorbing film that is poetic, violent, moving, and horrifying. Ramsay is a brave director, able to provoke emotion by showing very little and then rocking our emotions when she chooses to show a little more. The entire massacre scene unfolds in a staggering way that is frightening and unexpected, but never exploitative. It's a difficult film, but it's one of the best, most memorable of 2011. Films don't get more powerful than this.GRADE: A-",5,"A Powerful, Startling, and Unforgettable Film",1337990400,"05 26, 2012",2012,7859,"['Need', 'Talk', 'Kevin', 'based', 'novel', 'Lionel',

Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[3, 4]","What's it like to be a free spirit, a hippy in the day, a willy-nilly wisp of a woman who is impregnated during her first encounter with the father? What's it like to have that baby who immediately takes a sharp dislike of his mother? Is that possible? Is it possible that a severely twisted bond forms between mother and son, one that tests everything known and unknown about the maternal relationship?Such is the story in, first, the powerful novel, then its film adaptation. ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" is a highly charged, provocative, powerful film about the evolution of a born sociopath and his defiance of all that is normal.Why can the reader believe Eva, this reluctant mother? In the book her story is completely believable, but the movie offers another perspective. The casting made this viewer sharply cognizant of the its power. Goldie Hawn would have made a completely different mother, as would Angelina Jolie. But the pinch-faced, intense Tilda Swindon presents that high strung, totally free spirit who is shocked and dismayed at a baby who seemingly cannot stand her. This baby cries constantly from the time the father leaves in the morning until the father returns in the evening. As he grows into a toddler, this same hate/love behavior towards his parents continues.On paper such a controlling child seems totally sociopathic; on film he perhaps reacts to the apparent loveless attitude of his mother.""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" is a disturbing film, to say the least. Hatefulness, spite, revenge, such emotions to attribute to a child, but it's there. The audience knows this child exists and must watch his hateful acts.Kevin horrifies the world with his acts of violence toward the end, but, beware, Viewer, that is not the worst of his behavior. As his mother often told the father (in various words): ""We need to talk about Kevin."" Would it have helped if he had listened and talked? Such is a discussion for our violent culture. What do we do with such children? There is, however, a glimmer of redemption at the end.",5,"How a free spirit raises a sociopath--or, does that free spirit make a sociopath?",1347926400,"09 18, 2012",2012,2050,"['What', 'be', 'free', 'spirit', 'hippy', 'day', 'willy-nilly', 'wisp', 'woman', 'who', 'impregnated', 'first', 'encounter', 'father', 'What', 'have', 'baby', 'who', 'immediately', 'sharp', 'dislike', 'mother', 'possible', 'possible', 'severely', 'twisted', 'bond', 'forms', 'mother', 'son', 'one', 'everything', 'known', 'unknown', 'maternal', 'relationship', 'Such', 'story', 'first', 'powerful', 'novel', 'then', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Need', 'Talk', 'Kevin', 'highly', 'charged', 'provocative', 'powerful', 'film', 'evolution', 'born', 'sociopath', 'defiance', 'normal.Why', 'can', 'reader', 'believe', 'Eva', 'reluctant', 'mother', 'book', 'story', 'completely', 'believable', 'movie', 'perspective', 'casting', 'made', 'viewer', 'sharply', 'cognizant', 'power', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'completely', 'different', 'mother', 'would', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'pinch-faced', 'intense', 'Tilda', 'Swindon', 'high', 'strung', 'totally', 'free', 'spirit', 'who', 'shocked', 'dismayed', 'baby', 'who', 'seemingly', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'baby', 'constantly', 'time', 'father', 'morning', 'father', 'returns', 'evening', 'toddler', 'same', 'hate/love', 'behavior', 'parents', 'continues.On', 'paper', 'controlling', 'child', 'totally', 'sociopathic', 'film', 'perhaps', 'apparent', 'loveless', 'attitude', 'mother', 'Need', 'Talk', 'Kevin', 'disturbing', 'film', 'say', 'least', 'Hatefulness', 'spite', 'revenge', 'such', 'emotions', 'attribute', 'child', 'there', 'audience', 'child', 'must', 'watch', 'hateful', 'acts.Kevin', 'world', 'acts', 'violence', 'end', 'beware', 'Viewer', 'not', 'worst', 'behavior', 'mother', 'often', 'told', 'father', 'various', 'words', 'need', 'talk', 'Kevin', 'have', 'helped', 'had', 'listened', 'talked', 'Such', 'discussion', 'violent', 'culture', 'What', 'do', 'do', 'such', 'children', 'however', 'glimmer', 'redemption', 'end']",We Need to Talk About Kevin
1529377,A5LHEWTYFQVWP,B007C3TVEY,J. Wright,"[0, 0]","This film is an extraordinary portrait of a mother (nicely played by Tilda Swinton, a truly great actress) struggling with a psychopathic* child -- although this viewer was stunned by the amazing performance of Ezra Miller as the teenaged son, which dominates the second half of the film.  The director begins with disjointed moments from mom's life in true (and perhaps slightly clich&eacute;d) Indie Film style, but this technique works as it should here to disorient us and fill us with a sense of dread and impending doom.  We know something terrible is going to happen.  Nothing, however, prepared me for the powerful work of young Ezra Miller.  He can summon a coiled intensity like a cobra preparing to strike.  Several of his scenes are quite simply unforgettable for their preternatural stillness and menace.The director wisely opts not to show us the deaths of the students Kevin murders -- only the aftermath (seen early on in the film).  What we see instead is a long shot of Kevin shooting arrows in every direction, a sequence less distasteful than shots of the actual carnage would have been.  I think we have been desensitized to violence by countless dozens of movies, so the director's decision here is very wise, and the result more chilling than the alternative.  Equally memorable is the scene early in the film when the mother visits her son in prison, when all we see of him is the row of fingernails he has bitten off and carefully lined up on the table between them.  The huge gulf between mother and son here becomes palpable.There are also some fine bits of irony in the screenplay:  The kid is always sucking up to his dad, who teaches him to shoot a bow and arrow -- the same weapon later used to kill dad.  The finest scene of all may be at the end of the film when mom visits Kevin in prison for the last time:  His spirit seems to be broken (clearly prison has been hard on him), and he finally becomes the sweet son she always wanted.  Here Ezra Miller is superb -- almost unrecognizable as the same boy we have come to know.  This sort of thing is the very definition of great acting.  The music score reflects some irony as well, consisting rather surprisingly of country songs that provide a deft counterpoint and commentary to the mood of the film.This film is not recommended for expectant mothers, but urgently recommended for everyone else, both for the fine work of director Lynne Ramsay and the superb performances by the actors.(*Those interested in this subject should consider reading The Science of Evil: On Empathy and the Origins of Cruelty by Simon Baron-Cohen, a Cambridge psychologist best known for his research on autism and the lack of empathy).",5,"Psychopaths are born, not made",1354665600,"12 5, 2012",2012,2699,"['film', 'extraordinary', 'portrait', 'mother', 'nicely', 'played', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'truly', 'great', 'actress', 'struggling', 'psychopathic*', 'child', 'viewer', 'was', 'stunned', 'amazing', 'performance', 'Ezra', 'Miller', 'teenaged', 'son', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'director', 'disjointed', 'moments', 'mom', 'life', 'true', 'perhaps', 'slightly', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'Indie', 'Film', 'style', 'technique', 'should', 'here', 'disorient', 'fill', 'sense', 'dread', 'impending', 'doom', 'know', 'something', 'terrible', 'going', 'happen', 'Nothing', 'however', 'prepared', 'powerful', 'work', 'young', 'Ezra', 'Miller', 'can', 'summon', 'coiled', 'intensity', 'cobra', 'preparing', 'strike', 'Several', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'simply', 'unforgettable', 'preternatural', 'stillness', 'menace.The', 'director', 'wisely', 'not', 'show', 'deaths', 'students', 'Kevin', 'murders', 'only', 'aftermath', 'seen', 'early', 'film', 'What', 'see', 'instead', 'long', 'shot', 'Kevin', 'shooting', 'arrows', 'direction', 'sequence', 'less', 'distasteful', 'shots', 'actual', 'carnage', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'think', 'have', 'been', 'desensitized', 'violence', 'countless', 'dozens', 'movies', 'director', 'decision', 'here', 'very', 'wise', 'result', 'more', 'chilling', 'alternative', 'Equally', 'memorable', 'scene', 'early', 'film', 'when', 'mother', 'son', 'prison', 'when', 'see', 'row', 'fingernails', 'bitten', 'off', 'carefully', 'lined', 'up', 'table', 'huge', 'gulf', 'mother', 'son', 'here', 'palpable.There', 'are', 'also', 'fine', 'bits', 'irony', 'screenplay', 'kid', 'always', 'sucking', 'up', 'dad', 'who', 'shoot', 'bow', 'arrow', 'same', 'weapon', 'later', 'used', 'kill', 'dad', 'finest', 'scene', 'may', 'be', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'mom', 'visits', 'Kevin', 'prison', 'last', 'time', 'spirit', 'be', 'broken', 'clearly', 'prison', 'been', 'hard', 'finally', 'sweet', 'son', 'always', 'wanted', 'Here', 'Ezra', 'Miller', 'superb', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'same', 'boy', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'sort', 'thing', 'very', 'definition', 'great', 'acting', 'music', 'score', 'irony', 'as', 'well', 'consisting', 'rather', 'surprisingly', 'country', 'songs', 'provide', 'deft', 'counterpoint', 'commentary', 'mood', 'film.This', 'film', 'not', 'recommended', 'expectant', 'mothers', 'urgently', 'recommended', 'everyone', 'else', 'fine', 'work', 'director', 'Lynne', 'Ramsay', 'superb', 'performances', 'actors', '*Those', 'interested', 'subject', 'should', 'consider', 'reading', 'Science', 'Evil', 'Empathy', 'Origins', 'Cruelty', 'Simon', 'Baron-Cohen', 'Cambridge', 'psychologist', 'best', 'known', 'research', 'autism', 'lack', 'empathy']",We Need to Talk About Kevin
1529378,A132XGWKG6TYA2,B007C3TVEY,"Karen Hofferber ""rojamom""","[1, 1]","The first time I watched this movie it was before I'd read the book (same title). To be honest, I was lost for the first 10-15 minutes of this flick (the opening scenes were especially confusing) -- but holy cow, am I glad I hung there. I love me a good dark-and-twisted flick that is packed with intensity, character-development, and superb acting, and if you feel the same way then this movie definitely fits the bill. But if you're looking for lighthearted entertainment or a feel-good drama, then you should pass.Okay...with that disclaimer out of the way, allow me to further &#34;wax poetic&#34; on the virtues of this film.Kevin (superbly acted by Ezra Miller) is a deeply, DEEPLY, D*E*E*P*L*Y (did I say deeply?) disturbed youth. His mother (played equally superbly by Tilda Swinton) is a highly successful travel book writer who struggles to understand/accept/love her son in what proves to be an increasingly difficult endeavor as he grows on film from newborn to toddler to adolescent to teen. (And by the way, the child actor they cast as the young Kevin is a drop-dead ringer for the teen Kevin and is so evil and menacing in the scenes with mom Tilda that it gave me goosebumps -- truly evoked the feel of &#34;Damien&#34; in &#34;The Omen&#34; but sooooo much more effectively).One of the challenges of the film is its structure -- frequent and unannounced flashbacks (covering 2 time periods) and flash-forwards to the present can be a bit confusing (especially if you haven't read the book). But here's a tip: watch for the mom's (Tilda Swinton's) hair length -- when it's long, that's a flashback to the distant past (her early courtship/marriage to Kevin's father -- played by John C. Reilly -- who got mixed reviews for his role in this but I thought he was EXCELLENT). When her hair is super-short, that's a flashback to the more recent past (including her pregnancy with Kevin, which she feels ambivalent about, and her mothering of Kevin from infant to teenager). When her hair is mid-length, that's the present-tense for the movie (it serves as the &#34;after&#34; for the movie, but I can't go into more details about the &#34;after-what&#34; without including movie spoilers).Kevin's dad (John C. Reilly) remains blissfully unaware of any problems or issues regarding his son Kevin, despite his wife's (Tilda Swinton) increasingly urgent feeling that something is very, very wrong with their son.The movie swirls around the classic &#34;nature or nurture?&#34; argument given when youth go awry, and it is a very compelling drama that will leave you guessing until the end.After I read the book (by Lionel Shriver, which was also excellent), I watched the movie again and enjoyed it even more the second time around.This is not a movie for children and it is not a movie for the faint-of-heart. But if you appreciate chilling dramas with Oscar-calibur acting then this film will stick with you long after you watch it the first time and you'll probably want to watch it a 2nd (or even 3rd) time.

Tilda Swinton has more than proved herself in other movies and moves herself up the ladder here. Ezra Miller, the young man who so menacingly plays the teenage son was brilliant. Undoubtedly, we will see much more of him.The back and forth in timelines was seamless and not a bit confusing. Lynne Ramsay, who years ago, brought us the imagery of 'The Ratcatcher', uses what almost feels like a thematic montage with only a unity of the color red as film gets going. But, soon the message of motherhood vs. troubled child is underway. Foreshadowing in the color red is heavy handed, yet balanced with fact that there is no graphic violence. Interesting. Artsy. Hhhmmmm... I felt like I was standing back, studying a work by an artist that had just about, almost...got it.Unfortunately, people have come away from this expounding age old discourses and dissertations for or against 'Nature/Nurture'. Useless! This film keeps this question quite neutral, in my opinion. And, I think that is a good thing. This film should be judged by it's form, it's beauty, and even the emotion it has or has not engendered. Instead, reviewers are skipping to issues of science and heart.Please don't believe I haven't an opinion about Nature/Nurture. I do!

1529380,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,B007C3TVEY,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[4, 5]","Spoiler alert: While I've left out the pivotal events in this film, the details I've included may seem like spoilers so read this one at your own risk. I'd certainly welcome feedback about whether I gave too much away in this review. You might want to read it after seeing the film and answer some of the questions brought up in this review.This is the kind of movie that is not only highly controversial but likely to split viewers into the ""love it"" or ""absolutely hate it"" camp. Those who hate it are likely to find it beyond disturbing and actually loathsome.But  I was very eager to see this movie. If you've already viewed the film you might well wonder why.  The major reason was because I'd read the book on which this film is based and it haunted me.The movie is a very dark tale of one family and the way a difficult child can divide husband and wife as well as derail one mother's life. But is she to blame? I don't think so. Others may disagree. Instead, I think the film explores the age old question of nature versus nurture and how that affects moral development.From the outset, it is clear that Kevin and his mother, played by Tilda Swinton, seem to be at odds with each other. Why this is the case is less clear although some reviewers have felt that Kevin's mother is to blame for his chillingly cold heart.A crucial part of the movie resides in the last few sentences spoken by Kevin, shortly before the fiilm credits roll. If there is any hopeful note (and that is subject to interpretation) it is at that point in the movie.I wish I could write those words here but that would rob potential viewers of a riveting moment, what I consider the key to the theme of the movie. Listen to Kevin and you might even feel some sympathy for him, some sense of a person who may be as lost to himself as to his family.Not  all lives are sunny and there are not always pat endings as films likeRabbit Holeand others which explore painful family events make clear. In Rabbit Hole, Nicole Kidman did a stellar job showing how one woman dealth with the loss of a child.In We Need to Talk About Kevin, Tilda Swinton mines the depths of pain just as Kidman did in Rabbit Hole - although the family dynamics are far different. Swinton shows a woman who starts out with hope, giddily falls in love, gets pregnant and then goes on to have a life far different than she could possibly imagine. It could happen to many of us. Perhaps that also adds to the difficulty in sitting through this film. It made me squirm uncomfortably in my chair but it also made me want to know more about the mother and son at the heart of the movie.Swinton's character forced me to face the fact that even as we deny the reality, the truth is that our lives can change drastically in one moment and that horrific moment can change our lives for years - if not for the rest of our lives. .The lives portrayed here seemed very real. I could imagine a family where one child remained a mystery. It is hard to see this one and not wonder if the conscience is formed even before birth or whether parents have much impact on that. In short, is it genes or environment that affects personality most - a question that has been asked for years.I was awestruck by the imagery and camera work in We Need to Talk About Kevin. Many scenes are stunners simply because of a particular angle and some of the close-ups seem like artistic works, often ominous but portraying shocking events without graphic detail (although there are exceptions). Some of the most violent events have to be reconstructed in the viewers' imaginations.For those who believe Kevin's mother is at the root of his problems consider these questions:1. Why is the mother able to conceive, bear and nurture  a loving daughter?2. Could a difficult pregnancy and uncomfortable feelings actually be a foreboding of things to come or was there a true mismatch between mother and son? Or did mother turn against Kevin when her infant turned out to be exhausting and overwhelmed her? For that matter, did she ever turn against him or just grow disheartened as her attempts to reach him  seemed doomed.3. How and why are husband and wife so split in their feelings about Kevin? Are they both in denial or do they each have a truly different relationship with their son?4. Could anything have changed the outcome? Was there anything Kevin's mother could have done differently to change her son for the better? Or was the outcome fated almost from the day Kevin was born?",5,Painful to watch but thought-provoking look at family dynamics with a disturbed child,1337731200,"05 23, 2012",2012,4498,"['Spoiler', 'alert', ""'ve"", 'left', 'out', 'pivotal', 'events', 'film', 'details', ""'ve"", 'included', 'may', 'seem', 'spoilers', 'so', 'read', 'one', 'own', 'risk', ""'d"", 'certainly', 'welcome', 'feedback', 'gave', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'review', 'might', 'want', 'read', 'seeing', 'film', 'answer', 'questions', 'brought', 'up', 'review.This', 'kind', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'highly', 'controversial', 'likely', 'split', 'viewers', 'love', 'absolutely', 'hate', 'camp', 'who', 'hate', 'are', 'likely', 'find', 'disturbing', 'actually', 'loathsome.But', 'was', 'very', 'eager', 'see', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'already', 'viewed', 'film', 'might', 'well', 'wonder', 'why', 'major', 'reason', 'was', ""'d"", 'read', 'book', 'film', 'based', 'haunted', 'me.The', 'movie', 'very', 'dark', 'tale', 'one', 'family', 'way', 'difficult', 'child', 'can', 'divide', 'husband', 'wife', 'as', 'well', 'derail', 'one', 'mother', 'life', 'blame', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'Others', 'may', 'disagree', 'Instead', 'think', 'film', 'age', 'old', 'question', 'nature', 'versus', 'nurture', 'how', 'moral', 'outset', 'clear', 'Kevin', 'mother', 'played', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'seem', 'be', 'odds', 'other', 'Why', 'case', 'less', 'clear', 'reviewers', 'have', 'felt', 'Kevin', 'mother', 'blame', 'chillingly', 'cold', 'heart.A', 'crucial', 'part', 'movie', 'last', 'few', 'sentences', 'spoken', 'Kevin', 'shortly', 'fiilm', 'credits', 'roll', 'hopeful', 'note', 'subject', 'interpretation', 'point', 'movie.I', 'wish', 'could', 'write', 'words', 'here', 'would', 'rob', 'potential', 'viewers', 'riveting', 'moment', 'what', 'consider', 'key', 'theme', 'movie', 'Listen', 'Kevin', 'might', 'even', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'sense', 'person', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'lost', 'family.Not', 'lives', 'are', 'sunny', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'pat', 'endings', 'films', 'likeRabbit', 'Holeand', 'others', 'explore', 'painful', 'family', 'events', 'make', 'clear', 'Rabbit', 'Hole', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'did', 'stellar', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'one', 'woman', 'dealth', 'loss', 'child.In', 'Need', 'Talk', 'Kevin', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'depths', 'pain', 'just', 'Kidman', 'did', 'Rabbit', 'Hole', 'family', 'dynamics', 'are', 'far', 'different', 'Swinton', 'woman', 'who', 'out', 'hope', 'giddily', 'love', 'pregnant', 'then', 'have', 'life', 'far', 'different', 'could', 'possibly', 'imagine', 'could', 'happen', 'many', 'Perhaps', 'also', 'difficulty', 'sitting', 'film', 'made', 'squirm', 'uncomfortably', 'chair', 'also', 'made', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'mother', 'son', 'heart', 'movie.Swinton', 'character', 'forced', 'face', 'fact', 'even', 'deny', 'reality', 'truth', 'lives', 'can', 'change', 'drastically', 'one', 'moment', 'horrific', 'moment', 'can', 'change', 'lives', 'years', 'not', 'rest', 'lives', '.The', 'lives', 'portrayed', 'here', 'seemed', 'very', 'real', 'could', 'imagine', 'family', 'where', 'one', 'child', 'remained', 'mystery', 'hard', 'see', 'one', 'not', 'wonder', 'conscience', 'formed', 'even', 'birth', 'parents', 'have', 'much', 'impact', 'short', 'genes', 'environment', 'personality', 'most', 'question', 'been', 'asked', 'years.I', 'was', 'awestruck', 'imagery', 'camera', 'work', 'Need', 'Talk', 'Kevin', 'Many', 'scenes', 'are', 'stunners', 'simply', 'particular', 'angle', 'close-ups', 'seem', 'artistic', 'works', 'often', 'ominous', 'portraying', 'shocking', 'events', 'graphic', 'detail', 'are', 'exceptions', 'most', 'violent', 'events', 'have', 'be', 'reconstructed', 'viewers', 'imaginations.For', 'who', 'believe', 'Kevin', 'mother', 'root', 'problems', 'consider', 'questions:1', 'Why', 'mother', 'able', 'conceive', 'bear', 'nurture', 'loving', 'daughter', '2', 'Could', 'difficult', 'pregnancy', 'uncomfortable', 'feelings', 'actually', 'be', 'foreboding', 'things', 'come', 'was', 'true', 'mismatch', 'mother', 'son', 'did', 'mother', 'turn', 'Kevin', 'when', 'infant', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'exhausting', 'overwhelmed', 'matter', 'did', 'ever', 'turn', 'just', 'grow', 'disheartened', 'attempts', 'reach', 'seemed', 'doomed.3', 'How', 'why', 'are', 'husband', 'wife', 'so', 'split', 'feelings', 'Kevin', 'Are', 'denial', 'do', 'have', 'truly', 'different', 'relationship', 'son', '4', 'Could', 'anything', 'have', 'changed', 'outcome', 'Was', 'anything', 'Kevin', 'mother', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'differently', 'change', 'son', 'better', 'was', 'outcome', 'fated', 'almost', 'day', 'Kevin', 'was', 'born']",We Need to Talk About Kevin

From the outset it is clear that he has some problems (as a baby).3. When he is still not trained to use the toilet (by 5), it is clearer still that he has more problems.4. This story is told as a series of flashbacks in the mind of the mother of the family (it is not clear what has happened to the rest of her family until the end of the film). It's also apparent from present circumstances that something has been done that has ruined this woman's name in the town.5. As an adolescent, the boy's behavior becomes increasingly.......weird and uncomfortable. Everyone seems to see this except the father.6. Finally, the boy has his ""big moment."" That involves killing a couple of members of his family and several high school students.The biggest problems are that the suspense is drawn out too long (and we ultimately get no clear view of the killing) and the plot suffers from too many plausibility problems.Plausibility problems: 1. I know that parents are the last ones to know that their children have problems. But could any two people miss *that* many problems and that many warning signals? 2. Clumsy foreshadowing. Tomato sauce everywhere. Red jelly everywhere. Other red food objects everywhere. Um, ok. We get it. (Talk about symbolism overkill.) 3. After all that went down in that town, the mother still stayed there and didn't move on and change her name? And someone was still willing to hire her and put their business on the line after all that? 4. One person with a bow and arrow could take out that many people before being overpowered? 5. A 5 year old could *run* a house like that and his parents couldn't control him? 6. A mother would come and visit her son in jail after he killed her husband and daughter and all those people?Tilda Swinton is a great actress, and she did the best she could with a role that just wasn't all that believable.

1529386,ADGSHS2YUMH97,B007C3TVEY,Lisa R.N.,"[1, 1]","This film is actually a 3.5 star rating. However, I found somewhat creative in a different aspect of most films, giving it the extra 1/2 star. The symbolism of the color ""red"" was slightly overdone. This is a story (I didn't read the book) which could lead to several controversial subjects. From the beginning it's apparent a major tragedy has occurred in the mother's ""Eva"" (Swinton) family/life.  The movie changes scenes from the present to past events.  This may be a ""SPOILER,"" however I believe most know early on Eva's son was involved and her husband and dtg were victims. Eva has a son, ""Kevin."" Early, it's apparent Kevin isn't ordinary. He's highly intelligent. Is he a sociopath, a child needing strict discipline, or just evil? IMO, this is where the film goes too far. Even if he had no conscience, a 4-5 yr. old child can't rationalize a ""plan"" to fool a father who's a M.D., a published mother, albeit very unsure of herself. I found the main question to be, how far does a mother's love extend? The acting is very good. I want to read the book. As this is a movie of complex emotions and undertones I find would be nearly impossible for a viewer to understand what the writer intended. Personally, one comment from Kevin in prison made an impact. Telling his mother the majority end up ""watching TV at night. It's progressed to half of the people inside the TV are watching TV. What are they watching? Someone like me."" Definitely, ""food for thought."" Overall, the movie was avg to good. However, when the finale scene occurred, I felt somewhat cheated. However, the movie really isn't about the finale.  It's about what/why events leading to the finale occurred. Questions concerning nature/nurture vs. environment, unconditional love, etc. It was dark.

1529392,A2D37EP9KT2E3D,B007C3TVEY,"Mark bennett ""Mark""","[10, 20]","This is a film in the ""monster baby"" genre. These films typically provide a means by which people can express politically incorrect attitudes toward children and parenthood in a situation contrived to allow it. The film stacks the deck about as far as it can by making the child (Kevin) an irredeemable monster on a path toward monsterhood from birth. The greater his monsterhood, the greater the contrived excessess of his mother the film can wallow in.The fatal problem of the film is that it mixes a whole kitchen sink of general psychological baggage about parenting up with the problems of having been the parent of a child who has committed a horrible act. Doing either one of these subjects in isolation would have been good. Doing them both together is not so good. And not so good in particular because the one (his being a monster) allows the other (the psychological aspect) to go off without any bounds at all. Of course ultimately horror makes money and serious films dont.The film is also full of rather heavy handed symbolism. Subtile it is not. Red. Red. Red. Red....The film is about as nihilist as them come. Guilt and shame in fatal doses covers everything. No shades of grey anywhere. There is also more than a bit of rather mindless man-hatred lurking in the background. Its difficult to know how to look at some of this. Are her memories a real view of what happened or are they the product of revisionism based on guilt?In the end, its all so emotionally overheated and manipulative that its difficult to take anything serious away from it.

1529393,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B007C3TVEY,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[6, 7]","True artistry and deeply felt acting propel the quiet drama of WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN, a film about a boy who goes on a killing spree at his school. The son of Eva, a successful travel writer, and Franklin, a rather dopey and ineffectual husband, Kevin (played masterfully by three different young men, most notably the teen, Ezra Miller) is cold and intransigent. Even as a baby, he screams so relentlessly that Eva pauses by men working jack hammers just to get away from the noise of her son.The film is a menagerie of flashbacks, hazy images, and even segments that play very much like music videos. The tale jumps back and forth between Eva's current life as an ostracized (and often attacked) woman who can barely find a job (she wakes up to find her house covered in slashes of red paint, a color that is totemic for the film), and her previous life as a well-to-do mother and wife. As Eva struggles to live as a social pariah, she recounts the steps that led to Kevin's unthinkable behavior.The film is a pastiche of explanations and questions. It shows Eva experiencing not-so-motherly bursts of resentment toward her infant son. It also shows that son as being preternaturally smart and malicious. Eva is haunted constantly by the fear that she is not doing enough as a mother, but also that there is nothing she can do. The idea of Nature vs. Nurture is talked about a lot in connection with this movie, and for good reason, but it doesn't really seem like much of a debate in the film. Kevin, it seems, is clearly evil from the get-go.The real power of the film lies in Swinton's fascinating portrayal of the harried and horrified Eva. The boys who play Kevin in his various incarnations are all equally good, although -- as the one with the most screen time and lines -- Ezra Miller also shines. The complexity of Eva's relationship with her son is riveting, especially the parts of that relationship that manifest themselves after Kevin reveals his true nature to the world. Even knowing about and anticipating Kevin's murderous future does not diminish the impact of that moment of the film. I, for one, had my mouth hanging open. Even so, after that moment, Eva refuses to tear herself away from Kevin, and we finally see that the real message of the film isn't about what would cause a son to behave like Kevin, but what choices a parent has when faced with such horrendous offspring.Many viewers might be turned off by the film's slow pace, its often art-fogged cinematography, and its shattered-window structure. The movie requires a patient viewer, and one who is fascinated by truly resonant (if not downright ugly) characters. The movie is about a massacre, but don't expect a lot of blood and gore. Instead, the real horror can be found in Eva and Kevin's eyes, a mix of despair and coldness that left this viewer trembling in his seat.",5,"Cold, Dark, and Beautiful",1335312000,"04 25, 2012",2012,2864,"['True', 'artistry', 'deeply', 'felt', 'acting', 'propel', 'quiet', 'drama', 'WE', 'NEED', 'TO', 'TALK', 'ABOUT', 'KEVIN', 'film', 'boy', 'who', 'killing', 'spree', 'school', 'son', 'Eva', 'successful', 'travel', 'writer', 'Franklin', 'rather', 'dopey', 'ineffectual', 'husband', 'Kevin', 'played', 'masterfully', 'three', 'different', 'young', 'men', 'most', 'notably', 'teen', 'Ezra', 'Miller', 'cold', 'intransigent', 'Even', 'baby', 'so', 'relentlessly', 'Eva', 'pauses', 'men', 'working', 'jack', 'hammers', 'just', 'get', 'away', 'noise', 'son.The', 'film', 'menagerie', 'flashbacks', 'hazy', 'images', 'even', 'segments', 'play', 'very', 'much', 'music', 'videos', 'tale', 'back', 'forth', 'Eva', 'current', 'life', 'ostracized', 'often', 'attacked', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'barely', 'find', 'job', 'up', 'find', 'house', 'covered', 'slashes', 'red', 'paint', 'color', 'totemic', 'film', 'previous', 'life', 'well-to-do', 'mother', 'wife', 'Eva', 'live', 'social', 'pariah', 'steps', 'led', 'Kevin', 'unthinkable', 'behavior.The', 'film', 'pastiche', 'explanations', 'questions', 'Eva', 'experiencing', 'not-so-motherly', 'bursts', 'resentment', 'infant', 'son', 'also', 'son', 'being', 'preternaturally', 'smart', 'malicious', 'Eva', 'haunted', 'constantly', 'fear', 'not', 'doing', 'enough', 'mother', 'also', 'nothing', 'can', 'do', 'idea', 'Nature', 'vs.', 'Nurture', 'talked', 'lot', 'connection', 'movie', 'good', 'reason', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'much', 'debate', 'film', 'Kevin', 'clearly', 'evil', 'get-go.The', 'real', 'power', 'film', 'Swinton', 'fascinating', 'portrayal', 'harried', 'horrified', 'Eva', 'boys', 'who', 'play', 'Kevin', 'various', 'incarnations', 'are', 'equally', 'good', 'one', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'lines', 'Ezra', 'Miller', 'also', 'complexity', 'Eva', 'relationship', 'son', 'riveting', 'especially', 'parts', 'relationship', 'manifest', 'Kevin', 'true', 'nature', 'world', 'Even', 'knowing', 'anticipating', 'Kevin', 'murderous', 'future', 'not', 'diminish', 'impact', 'moment', 'film', 'one', 'had', 'mouth', 'hanging', 'open', 'Even', 'so', 'moment', 'Eva', 'tear', 'away', 'Kevin', 'finally', 'see', 'real', 'message', 'film', ""n't"", 'what', 'would', 'cause', 'son', 'behave', 'Kevin', 'what', 'parent', 'when', 'faced', 'such', 'horrendous', 'offspring.Many', 'viewers', 'might', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'film', 'slow', 'pace', 'often', 'art-fogged', 'cinematography', 'shattered-window', 'structure', 'movie', 'patient', 'viewer', 'one', 'who', 'fascinated', 'truly', 'resonant', 'not', 'downright', 'ugly', 'characters', 'movie', 'massacre', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'lot', 'blood', 'gore', 'Instead', 'real', 'horror', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'Eva', 'Kevin', 'eyes', 'mix', 'despair', 'coldness', 'left', 'viewer', 'trembling', 'seat']",We Need to Talk About Kevin

I know it's impossible to add every detail of a book into a film, but a lot of the scenes were wasted on images of home improvement projects gone awry.This should have been a better movie for the simple fact that the subject matter of a school killing is chilling, controversial and timely. It almost felt like the director depended on that so much that the actual story got lost in the almost two hours of blurry, nonlinear images.What really bothered me is that the description of the movie promised a ""chilling ""ending.

Critically this film by Lynne Ramsay (director/co-writer) explores the development of a serial killer from birth to adolescence.  From the beginning Eva (a superb Tilda Swinton) wasn't sure she wanted to give up her career as a travel journalist but her husband (John C. Reilly) thinks it's time to start a family.The first born, Kevin (Jasper Newell at 8 and creepy Ezra Miller as a teen) never connected with his Eva.  He seemed to gravitate to Franklin (Reilly) and hate his mother.  Eva's exasperation with Kevin leads to clear psychological trauma.  The film jumps around all over the place with no real place-setters, so about the time we figure out what's what, it's time to jump again.While Swinton and Miller give memorable performances, you have to ask yourself why this movie had to be made.  It is unsettling, disturbing and over-stylized.  As expected, we never get the answer to Eva's question to her son.  Why?  Indeed, why?The Blu ray disc looks excellent with the transfer in the original 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  The color palet is excellent and the detail exemplary.

I understand what was driving at - &#34;sometimes there is no why&#34; - but it didn't fulfill me.Tilda Swinton&#65279; is Eva, the titular Kevin's mother, who is trying to come to terms with her son's crimes. Through a series of flashbacks, we see her meeting Kevin's father, having a job she enjoys and then eventually giving birth to Kevin - who is a difficult child. Mother and son have difficulty bonding, although there is nothing overtly wrong. A daughter follows, and this deepens the divide between mother and son. Interspersed with this build up, we see Eva visiting her now grown up son in prison, and treated badly by the townspeople for her son's undescribed crime.And this where the movie falls down.In the  final reveal, we see that Kevin has killed his father and sister, and then set about massacring his classmates with a bow and arrow. This in itself, isn't my issue. My issue is this; Eva finally confronts her son, as he is about to be moved from juvenile to adult prison. Kevin tells her that he used to know why he did it... but now he's not so sure.And that's it.I know that this movie is based on Lionel Shriver&#65279;'s We Need to Talk About Kevin&#65279;, but it felt like it was borrowing heavily from Stephen King&#65279;'s &#34;Rage&#34; (when he was writing as Richard Bachman&#65279;) - where a student takes his class hostage for reasons that cannot be articulated.

Boy, did the movie surprise me!The first 20-25 min. of the movie are absolutely transfixing, as there is hardly any conversation, and there are miltiple story lines going on at the same time. The picture that eventually emerges is one where Eva (Kevin's mom) is dealing with the traumas of whatever Kevin has done (we don't know until much later in the movie what that is), and also, in flashbacks, reflecting on how Kevin grew up (and why he turned out the way he did, and of course where there was anything she could've done better or differently). The acting in the movie is mostly outstanding, with Tilda Swinton as Eva, but the 3 actors who portray Kevin are equally effective, none more so in my opition than Jasper Newell as six to eight year old Kevin.This is a chilly and devastating movie, but oh-so-good. I was literally frozen into my chair as I watched this movie unfold. Given the general premise of the movie, and the fact that there really isn't a single uplifting moment in it, it is amazing that this movie even got made at all (and not so amazing that a good part of the funding came from BBC Films, apparently).

""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" was one of the best books I'd read in years, and was looking forward to seeing how it might be adapted to film.  My hopes were not high (I've seen too many made-for-film adaptations for optimism in this regard), but I was more than pleasantly surprised.  All of the elements that made the story work on paper translated well onto film (great character development, the complex relationships, the multi-faceted characters, Kevin's ""other-ness"", among others).  What surprised me was how compelling I found the film version of Kevin.  In the book, Kevin was far creepier, and strange in a more unattractive way; in the movie, he was smarter, more provocative, and (dare I say it?) alluring, even.  There were even subtle hints of it visible in the 6- to 8-year-old Kevin [paging Dr. Freud...].  In any event, there was something dangerously and menacingly attractive about teenage Kevin that I didn't catch in the book...but I did here.Tilda Swenton was perfect as fragile, disillusioned, and cosmically disappointed Eva, and John Reilly was the quintessential supportive husband/dad in denial.

Zwick,"[0, 0]","Every time some deranged individual goes on a mass killing spree, we rightly focus our attention and concern on the victims and the devastated loved ones they leave behind. But who thinks about the impact such events have on the family of the killer?  Well, the makers of ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" certainly have, and the result is both heartbreaking and blood-curdling to witness.This grimly fascinating indie drama focuses on Eva (Tilda Swinton in a bravura performance), the mother of a troubled teen who slaughters a number of his fellow classmates in a high school assembly.  The multi-tiered screenplay by Rory Kinnear and director Lynne Ramsay looks at Eva's life both after the massacre and in the years leading up to it (Kevin is played  by three different actors  at various stages of life).From the beginning, Kevin is clearly a problem child, a ""bad seed"" as it were, for lack of a better term (think of Damian sans the supernatural powers and Satanic bloodline).  Perpetually frustrated and exhausted, filled with self-loathing and doubt, Eva spends every waking moment struggling to be a decent mother to her child, but nothing she does or says can break through the emotional barrier the sociopathic Kevin has set up between himself and the world.  Eva is further isolated by the fact that Kevin even has his own father (John C. Reilly) deluded into believing that the problem does indeed lie with Eva, in her weaknesses and inadequacies as a mother - almost to the point where even Eva, at some level, begins to believe it herself.Swinton breaks our hearts every step of the way as she wages a constant, solitary battle against a force she has no hope of ever understanding or controlling - for all the parents around her seem to have no such problems raising their own, much more reasonable and malleable children.  It leads us to the broader question of what happens when that most basic of all human bonds - that between a parent and a child - is irrevocably broken.  And how is a parent to love a child who steadfastly refuses to love her back?And life is certainly no better for Eva after the killings, for now she is forced to live out the rest of her life as a pariah in a community that blames her in large part for the tragic loss it has suffered, a community that has no interest in reaching out to her for understanding or healing. Her fate, then, is to struggle on alone, devoid of sympathy, compassion and any chance at reparation.""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" may be one of the bleakest and most despairing portraits of parenthood and childrearing ever committed to film, but it makes for a haunting and unnerving experience that you will find very hard to shake.",4,"A ""Bad Seed"" for the 21st Century",1359763200,"02 2, 2013",2013,2697,"['time', 'deranged', 'individual', 'mass', 'killing', 'spree', 'rightly', 'focus', 'attention', 'concern', 'victims', 'devastated', 'loved', 'ones', 'leave', 'who', 'impact', 'such', 'events', 'have', 'family', 'killer', 'Well', 'makers', 'Need', 'Talk', 'Kevin', 'certainly', 'have', 'result', 'heartbreaking', 'blood-curdling', 'witness.This', 'grimly', 'fascinating', 'indie', 'drama', 'Eva', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'bravura', 'performance', 'mother', 'troubled', 'teen', 'who', 'number', 'fellow', 'classmates', 'high', 'school', 'assembly', 'multi-tiered', 'screenplay', 'Rory', 'Kinnear', 'director', 'Lynne', 'Ramsay', 'Eva', 'life', 'massacre', 'years', 'leading', 'up', 'Kevin', 'played', 'three', 'different', 'actors', 'various', 'stages', 'life', 'beginning', 'Kevin', 'clearly', 'problem', 'child', 'bad', 'seed', 'were', 'lack', 'better', 'term', 'think', 'Damian', 'sans', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'Satanic', 'bloodline', 'Perpetually', 'frustrated', 'exhausted', 'filled', 'self-loathing', 'doubt', 'Eva', 'waking', 'moment', 'struggling', 'be', 'decent', 'mother', 'child', 'nothing', 'can', 'break', 'emotional', 'barrier', 'sociopathic', 'Kevin', 'set', 'up', 'world', 'Eva', 'further', 'isolated', 'fact', 'Kevin', 'even', 'own', 'father', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'deluded', 'believing', 'problem', 'indeed', 'lie', 'Eva', 'weaknesses', 'inadequacies', 'mother', 'almost', 'point', 'where', 'even', 'Eva', 'level', 'believe', 'hearts', 'step', 'way', 'constant', 'solitary', 'battle', 'force', 'hope', 'ever', 'understanding', 'controlling', 'parents', 'seem', 'have', 'such', 'problems', 'raising', 'own', 'much', 'more', 'reasonable', 'malleable', 'children', 'broader', 'question', 'what', 'when', 'most', 'basic', 'human', 'bonds', 'parent', 'child', 'irrevocably', 'broken', 'how', 'parent', 'love', 'child', 'who', 'steadfastly', 'love', 'back', 'life', 'certainly', 'no', 'better', 'Eva', 'killings', 'now', 'forced', 'live', 'out', 'rest', 'life', 'pariah', 'community', 'large', 'part', 'tragic', 'loss', 'suffered', 'community', 'interest', 'reaching', 'out', 'understanding', 'healing', 'fate', 'then', 'struggle', 'alone', 'devoid', 'sympathy', 'compassion', 'chance', 'reparation', 'Need', 'Talk', 'Kevin', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'bleakest', 'most', 'despairing', 'portraits', 'parenthood', 'childrearing', 'ever', 'committed', 'film', 'haunting', 'unnerving', 'experience', 'will', 'find', 'very', 'hard', 'shake']",We Need to Talk About Kevin

1529428,A387BD735MI50R,B007C3TVEY,R. Schultz,"[1, 1]","I took this movie to be about the budding and full night-blooming of a psychopath, and how the presence of such an individual affects a family. From infancy on, Kevin has an instinct for inflicting an endless series of sadisms, aimed particularly at his mother. This movie shows the ominous growth of his malignancy.But this movie is more subtle and realistic than other shockers about ""The Good Son"" who is really oh-so-bad. This film portrays an animus that I felt really could exist in the heart of a warped individual. This becomes a fascinating study in how family dynamics get defined by the most perverse member of that family.After the shocking inflictions of Kevin though, this DVD gave me another, perhaps even more unsettling shock when I listened to the interview bonus features on it. The majority of people involved with the making of this movie put the blame for Kevin's maladjustment directly on his mother, played with such stark effect by Tilda Swinton! Producer, director, and Swinton herself, generally seemed to be saying that Kevin's predations were caused by his mother's initial reluctance about her pregnancy, and then her subsequent ""lack of authenticity"" as a parent. What?!This attitude among presumably modern people is a throwback to the days when mothers (usually mothers) were blamed for children's autism, schizophrenia, or Tourette 's syndrome. The mothers were accused of being overbearing, or alternately, too indulgent. I felt strongly that it was no failure in parenting that planted the bad seed in the heart of Kevin. In this sense, the producer/director's harsh judgment on the mother reflect the same  ill-informed, almost lynch-mob-like blame that the film shows the townspeople casting on Swinton's character as a result of her son's ultimate actions. All this adds to the weight the mother in this film, and beleaguered mothers everywhere, still must bear.It's true that Swinton is shown looking bleak and at a loss directly after Kevin's birth. In the early silences of the film, we see the mother harkening back to her glamorous days apparently as an acclaimed writer and a globe-trotter - reveling in places such as the annual tomato-throwing festival in Bunol, Spain. (The film's symbolism and premonition is a little obvious here, opening as it does on Swinton being splattered by, drowning in, the blood-red tomato puree of the festival.)But really, a mother's being ambivalent about a pregnancy and having some, perhaps transient, sense of a descending bleakness, hardly gives rise to a psychopath!In addition to being about something other than what its producers think it's about, this film seemed to me to perhaps make a few cinematic missteps. After that over-the-top obviousness of the tomato festival, Swinton is shown in a series of overly arty shots, sterilized, pinioned against exaggerated backdrops, such as a Warhol-like grocery shelf full of red soup cans.

1529436,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B007C3TVEY,Sheryl Fechter,"[1, 1]","Lynne Ramsay writes this screenplay from the novel of the same name by Lionel Shriver, then turns to directing ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"".  I was held astounded and mortified throughout this very dark and disturbingly brave portrait of unbridled evil.  At the movie's time of 49:18, I found it necessary for me to pause it just to catch a breath as my emotions were running wild for this mother; empathy, fear, suspicion, bewilderment ...Tilda Swinton (Eva) pours-out a brilliant, emotionally exhausting portrayal of a mother who, in my estimation, never had a chance with the force that drove her son Kevin (Ezra Miller).  She relentlessly tries everything that a mother can possibly do.  I could find neither fault nor blame in her character while I constantly scrutinized this play out for a point, or situation, that it could have turned for the better.This work is done amazingly well with it's metaphoric red symbolism carried throughout. It may be visually tiring, although I thought that it was meant to carry this breathless pacing. It starts shockingly, at the beginning, and continues to the point of losing any possible hope for its conclusion; the point you no longer see red.  This fragmented and flashback style, especially in the first half, is well shown through the cinematography of Seamus McGarvey.The soundtrack (Jonny Greenwood's Original Score) may come under fire for some 'odd' or 'unusual' song choices, mainly in the beginning. Although, for myself, it made a lot of sense as the story went forward.  Its beginning is in the time when Eva is flashing back to all that has happened and is living on sort of an autopilot; completely drained and traumatized. The folk-song type selections, concerning a mother's love, add to the total confusion of what Kevin is doing to Eva.  I found it a little 'off', at first, then correctly confusing and thematically dichotomous. It mockingly lends to the question; What the heck is going on?Eva and husband Franklin (John C. Reilly) present two different relationships with their son, starting from birth then to the younger-age Kevin (an astounding Jasper Newell).  Franklin keeps trying to support his wife although never sees, with his own eyes, any peculiar behavior from his son, only hears everything that is wrong with Kevin from Eva.  Kevin remains manipulative and conniving in his actions toward Eva and is obviously enjoying her reactions of pain and utter bewilderment.  Eva is silently screaming 'help me' throughout this while going unnoticed by her husband although it is obviously picked-up and run-away with by Kevin.Once Kevin is in the teen years, Ezra Miller (""Another Happy Day"", ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"") takes over and does a tour-de-force of extremes; in a cruel and bizarre manner towards his mother.  With Miller's facial expressions and mannerisms, which are so wickedly ominous, it is obvious, once again, just how much he is enjoying this ... her pain.One understands, from the outset, that nothing good will come of this. Noticing the clock on the bedside table change from 12:00 to 12:01, we are forebode with the idea of what could transpire in just one minute ... and does.  As Kevin takes his final bow, everything comes full circle in the horrific unraveling of a family.",5,"""Why would I not know the context?"" ...

Imagine what it must be like to be the mother of one of the Columbine shooters, imagine the guilt, this film deals how a woman lives with the sins of her son after he commits a heinous act.  We know from science that psychopaths are born not made and good decent parents can raise a psychopathic child but this woman, played brilliantly by Tilda Swinton, blames herself because she never liked her son, she didn't want him from the beginning.  The character blames herself because she knew all along that there was something wrong with her boy.  She goes on to punish herself by remaining in the town where everyone knows her story, taking a job that's beneath her and even eating her son's favorite sandwich ( strawberry jelly on white bread).  By the time this film ends you'll be exhausted by the weight of this woman's guilt, you'll feel the pressure of her anxiety and soul crushing loss.  Its not a terrifying film, its subtle and nuanced drawing a profile of the mother's existence and her choices.  Only Tilda Swinton could have tackled this role.  The child is depicted a pure evil and its impossible to have any sympathy or empathy for him except at the very end of the film when you realize he doesn't understand himself and didn't understand the motivations of his own actions.  Its only at the end do you question whether the child is really a psychopath or just a boy he reacted to the knowledge that he was never loved by his own mother.  The final scene brings up a lot of doubt as to whether he was really evil or behaving so because he knew his mother thought that of him.  Every action on his part seems designed to hurt his mother which is why he makes sure she's left alive to live with his actions.

1529440,AKT8I9H8R37LI,B007C3TVEY,Sunny Dae,"[10, 12]","We Need To Talk About Kevin was one of the most disturbingly fascinating books I've ever read. I finally got to see it on DVD and was left terribly disappointed.To be fair, I don't believe anyone could have done a film version justice. The book told the story entirely from inside Eva's head, and the reader viewed Kevin with the same confusion as she did. We wondered along with her, was Eva a horrible mother? Or was Kevin just ""born bad""? Each incident could be viewed from both sides of the equation as Eva turned it over in her mind, struggling to comprehend what led up to the school massacre.We can't get inside Eva's head in a film, and can only witness her interactions with her son as outsiders. The complexity of their relationship is lost. We see Kevin as a bratty child and a sullen teenager, but honestly not all that different from a lot of other kids. It's therefore harder to empathize with Eva, and she comes off as a one-dimensional, resentful woman who didn't want a child and doesn't like the one she got. No wonder Kevin is so cold to her, and gravitates towards his father! The book showed far more depth to both characters' personalities.The epistolary format of the book was something that could not have been easily translated to the screen, but it was a big part of what made the book so breathtaking, particularly at the end, when we realize why Eva is now estranged from her husband. The portrayal of Franklin, by the way, is one of the few things the film improved on. John C. Reilly made Eva's husband far more likable than the clueless dolt he was in the book, refusing to believe that his darling son could do wrong. I can not say the same for Tilda Swinton as Eva. I'm surprised at the rave reviews she received - I found her completely bland and emotionless.Finally, I was disappointed by the glossing over of the actual massacre in the school gym. Not that I was looking forward to the gore, but Kevin's meticulous, finely-detailed planning of the ""big event"" in the book added to the horror and showed us what a twisted soul he really was.The novel was a five star read.

1529441,A18ECWTWII1KSU,B007C3TVEY,susannah,"[0, 0]","SPOILERS.........I don't know if I ""liked"" this film. It, and the actors, particularly Tilda Swinton, succeeded in portraying the possible reality of everyone living in such a situation, the rejected love, the maturation of evil, the agony and pure terror, the pain. Those are all very uncomfortable emotions, and so again, I wouldn't say I liked it. I found the editing technique to be pretty chaotic, when each scene is of a different place and time. Sometimes I wasn't quite sure where or when.I do not agree with the premise of the film and also those of a number of reviewers, that the ""problem"" with Kevin was due to his mother's failings as a parent. First off, it seems to be a common thing that the ""instant bonding"" doesn't always take place instantly. Secondly, the other side of the bonding has to come from the baby, and with Kevin, it never did. Kevin's problems were not caused by ""no one loving him,"" because his mother did love him, in her way. She was there, talking to him, rolling the ball to him, reading to him, visiting him at the prison. He rejected her until he was old enough to start being deliberately malicious. She was the only one who saw it, since Kevin put on a good show for his ""loving"" BLIND father. What I wanted her to do was to leave them, and see how long Kevin put on the show for his father, when he had no one else to torment, and maybe that would have opened the father's eyes to Kevin's reality.It was clear that something was wrong with Kevin early on, but no one except his mother could see it. Why did his father and the drs think there was nothing wrong with a boy who wasn't talking or still not toilet trained at age six or so? In regard to the abuse scene, it felt odd. I am sure any mother would be VERY tired of changing diapers on a boy far too old to still be wearing them, with no disability noted, but I didn't get why she would become angry that he had dirtied his diaper, when he was still wearing them? It wasn't like he was using the toilet, so what else would he do? Also, since she threw him against the wall, where did that mark/scar come from? His blackmailing was just chilling.It seems to me that Kevin was clearly born without the empathy gene, or was the definition of a sociopath,and nothing his mother could have done could change that. What I don't get, is how, since Kevin's mother knew that he was capable of evil, they ever thought it was a good idea to give him a deadly weapon, but this scenario has been played out in one school shooting after another. Everyone would know that the boy wasn't ""right,"" yet gave him access to guns. I also wouldn't have brought a new child anywhere near him. She was lucky she lived as long as she did, even though she had already lost an eye. How is it that she still felt loving and safe with her brother after he blinded her? I am glad though that the film didn't show what he did with the hamster. I had visions of it being pinned to the target, since we heard Kevin shooting while they were looking for it. Also, how would those plastic locks have kept Kevin out of the cupboard where the Drano was? Even the daughter was old enough to open them. I got a different impression with the scene where Kevin was sick. I didn't think that he was being nice to his mother because she was reading about shooting the arrows, I thought it was because he was sick and needed her. Icould be mistaken.The couple of things I had real issues with was how Kevin killed a bunch of kids with arrows. It didn't show the actual shootings or how  many kids or what room they were in, but I find it hard to believe that they all were equally as helpless, to hide, to try to disable or disarm Kevin as if he was shooting them with an assault rifle, or that he was able to achieve maximum fatalities with one arrow each. That was really stretching credibility. Also, at the end, when Kevin was going to be transferred to an adult prison, he acted scared, and unsure. Those are normal emotional responses. A real sociopath wouldn't feel them.",3,Heavy,1366934400,"04 26, 2013",2013,4033,"['SPOILERS', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'liked', 'film', 'actors', 'particularly', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'succeeded', 'portraying', 'possible', 'reality', 'everyone', 'living', 'such', 'situation', 'rejected', 'love', 'maturation', 'evil', 'agony', 'pure', 'terror', 'pain', 'are', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'emotions', 'so', 'again', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'liked', 'found', 'editing', 'technique', 'be', 'pretty', 'chaotic', 'when', 'scene', 'different', 'place', 'time', 'Sometimes', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'where', 'when.I', 'do', 'not', 'agree', 'premise', 'film', 'also', 'number', 'reviewers', 'problem', 'Kevin', 'was', 'due', 'mother', 'failings', 'parent', 'First', 'be', 'common', 'thing', 'instant', 'bonding', ""n't"", 'always', 'take', 'place', 'instantly', 'Secondly', 'other', 'side', 'bonding', 'come', 'baby', 'Kevin', 'never', 'did', 'Kevin', 'problems', 'were', 'not', 'caused', 'one', 'loving', 'mother', 'did', 'love', 'way', 'was', 'there', 'talking', 'rolling', 'ball', 'reading', 'visiting', 'prison', 'rejected', 'was', 'old', 'enough', 'start', 'being', 'deliberately', 'malicious', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'saw', 'Kevin', 'put', 'good', 'show', 'loving', 'BLIND', 'father', 'What', 'wanted', 'do', 'was', 'leave', 'see', 'how', 'long', 'Kevin', 'put', 'show', 'father', 'when', 'had', 'one', 'else', 'torment', 'maybe', 'would', 'have', 'opened', 'father', 'eyes', 'Kevin', 'reality.It', 'was', 'clear', 'something', 'was', 'wrong', 'Kevin', 'early', 'one', 'mother', 'could', 'see', 'Why', 'did', 'father', 'drs', 'think', 'was', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'boy', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'talking', 'still', 'not', 'toilet', 'trained', 'age', 'six', 'so', 'regard', 'abuse', 'scene', 'felt', 'odd', 'am', 'sure', 'mother', 'would', 'be', 'VERY', 'tired', 'changing', 'diapers', 'boy', 'far', 'too', 'old', 'still', 'be', 'wearing', 'disability', 'noted', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', 'would', 'become', 'angry', 'had', 'dirtied', 'diaper', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'wearing', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'using', 'toilet', 'what', 'else', 'would', 'do', 'Also', 'threw', 'wall', 'where', 'did', 'mark/scar', 'come', 'blackmailing', 'was', 'just', 'chilling.It', 'Kevin', 'was', 'clearly', 'born', 'empathy', 'gene', 'was', 'definition', 'sociopath', 'nothing', 'mother', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'could', 'change', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'how', 'Kevin', 'mother', 'knew', 'was', 'capable', 'evil', 'ever', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'give', 'deadly', 'weapon', 'scenario', 'been', 'played', 'out', 'one', 'school', 'shooting', 'Everyone', 'would', 'know', 'boy', 'was', ""n't"", 'right', 'yet', 'gave', 'access', 'guns', 'also', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'brought', 'new', 'child', 'anywhere', 'was', 'lucky', 'lived', 'as', 'long', 'did', 'even', 'had', 'already', 'lost', 'eye', 'How', 'still', 'felt', 'loving', 'safe', 'brother', 'blinded', 'am', 'glad', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'what', 'did', 'hamster', 'had', 'visions', 'being', 'pinned', 'target', 'heard', 'Kevin', 'shooting', 'were', 'looking', 'Also', 'how', 'would', 'plastic', 'locks', 'have', 'kept', 'Kevin', 'cupboard', 'where', 'Drano', 'was', 'Even', 'daughter', 'was', 'old', 'enough', 'open', 'got', 'different', 'impression', 'scene', 'where', 'Kevin', 'was', 'sick', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'being', 'nice', 'mother', 'was', 'reading', 'shooting', 'arrows', 'thought', 'was', 'was', 'sick', 'needed', 'Icould', 'be', 'mistaken.The', 'couple', 'things', 'had', 'real', 'issues', 'was', 'how', 'Kevin', 'killed', 'bunch', 'kids', 'arrows', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'actual', 'shootings', 'how', 'many', 'kids', 'what', 'room', 'were', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'were', 'equally', 'helpless', 'hide', 'try', 'disable', 'disarm', 'Kevin', 'was', 'shooting', 'assault', 'rifle', 'was', 'able', 'achieve', 'maximum', 'fatalities', 'one', 'arrow', 'was', 'really', 'stretching', 'credibility', 'Also', 'end', 'when', 'Kevin', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'transferred', 'adult', 'prison', 'acted', 'scared', 'unsure', 'are', 'normal', 'emotional', 'responses', 'real', 'sociopath', 'would', ""n't"", 'feel']",We Need to Talk About Kevin

OMG, I was not prepared for how horribly wrong it could go. I gave two hours of my life (that I can't get back) to an inexperienced writer and director. (sigh)*****SPOILER ALERT*****Working in the mental health field makes it hard to enjoy psychological thrillers because so often, the writers don't do their research. They create characters that don't exist in nature. Kevin was one such character. His behavior didn't match any diagnosis, so I could only conclude that he was born evil. That makes this a horror movie, not a psychological thriller. That also meant that he didn't have to have any reason for his decisions. It was totally random, which is emotionally unsatisfactory. I just spent 2 hours trying to get to know these people. I don't want to feel like everything happened, ""just because.""Kevin's method for doing what he did (trying not to totally spoil it) is inexplicable. I do what he does. He didn't have the appropriate equipment to complete the task. His ""efforts"" weren't lethal. He could have easily been taken down if there were a lot of people in the gym. He would not have been unscathed or the only one standing. Again, poor research or incomplete information (or the film didn't show enough to overcome these observations).The plot advances largely from thoughts inside Mommer's head. Unfortunately, it takes a while to catch on that you are inside Mommer's head, so it just feels like the action is randomly jumping forward and back. I was 30-40 minutes into the film before I had any idea what was going on. Even then, it was only a vague understanding of the story. I get that sometimes things don't come together for a while, but since this movie really didn't make it there, in retrospect, I feel like I should have used that first 30 minutes as a clue to to give up and move on.It feels like someone said, ""Wow, we've got some great raw material to work with and show off all my artistic creativity."" Unfortunately, all the artsy tricks can't make up for lack of research, poor writing, and just not filling in the blanks.  This movie doesn't answer the question of what happened to Kevin? What was his motivation? Why was the community so hateful to the MOM? What did SHE do? You don't get any sense of who the victims were or why they were chosen. Without that information, it all just seems senseless. While I am not heartless, my reaction is, ""So what?""

1529445,A3KKOJ6T4DCBDT,B007C3TVEY,"technoguy ""jack""","[2, 3]","Tilda Swinton is stripped of her exotic androgyny as the guilt-ridden mother,Eva, who gloried in her formerly independent state of freewheeling travel and love of Franklin her husband.The book and film dealt with a taboo: what if a mother doesn't like her son or can't bond with him?Debate centred upon maternal ambivalence and bad parenting.What if a child felt unwanted, would his lack of love be turned into a weapon of manipulative psychopathy?Pregnancy doesn't kickstart the milk of human kindness.The parents are dishonest in their dealings with Kevin's bad behaviour,lack of empathy and subtle malevolence.Eva puts up with his negative behavoiur and never really confronts him,even though she knows she should.Franklin(JC Reilly) buries his head in the sand,pretends everything is hunky-dory,overcompensating for Eva's lack of affection for Kevin. Kevin levers himself between the two of them and exposes their weakness.Kevin is no Damien:he's both arrogant and cruel to mother and sister,disrespects but loves his dad,but he's also vulnerable, though he's the context of vast cunning and manipulative evil.Kevin has picked up from a very young age he is the cause of his mother's loss of freedom,so he is perfectly capable of talking but she thinks he intentionally holds back on his language development out of spite as he doesn't want to please her. Similarly, she thinks he is perfectly capable of bowel control and toilet training, but until the age of 6 he is still in nappies, making her life intentionally as awkward as possible.Of course due to the problems of running time and the slashing of the budget,Ramsay has had to concertina the story in a flashback structure(we leave out the epistolary nature of the novel)stripping down the literary conceit,giving us a delayed reveal through net curtains veiling the worst of Kevin's misdemeanours. We get the splintering of time,the symbolism of imagery with the colour red, tomatoes,paint,soup cans,to immerse you in the tormented, fragmented memories of the woman who is depicted as the victim,nailed teeth-grindingly and reluctantly to motherhood,and the monstrous nature of her evolving son. Jasper Newell and Ezra Miller are brilliant younger and older Kevins.This is not treated as an issue film,we are given the subjective view of Eva looking back and asking what went wrong from Kevin's conception to his murders,in the story of her family. Eva instantly feels a connection with her daughter in a way she never did for Kevin. Whether that makes him jealous or whatever, he always uses her to torment Eva further. Once her daughter loses her eye (because of Kevin or not, who knows) then Kevin constantly picks on her about it. Swinton plays her part superbly well,one of anxiety,coldness and tension. The cinematography and sound design are beautiful as is the editing, just excellent. However where the film falls down is perhaps in the plot and execution of story. We're left almost wondering what the entire purpose of the film was,it's an impressionistic rendition of a mother's experience and the nature of her unconditional love for a confused, complex,damaged and disturbed child.Brave but ultimately flawed.",3,The calculus of the unwanted child,1332288000,"03 21, 2012",2012,3186,"['Tilda', 'Swinton', 'stripped', 'exotic', 'androgyny', 'guilt-ridden', 'mother', 'Eva', 'who', 'gloried', 'formerly', 'independent', 'state', 'freewheeling', 'travel', 'love', 'Franklin', 'husband.The', 'book', 'film', 'dealt', 'taboo', 'what', 'mother', ""n't"", 'like', 'son', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bond', 'Debate', 'centred', 'maternal', 'ambivalence', 'bad', 'parenting.What', 'child', 'felt', 'unwanted', 'would', 'lack', 'love', 'be', 'turned', 'weapon', 'manipulative', 'psychopathy', 'Pregnancy', ""n't"", 'kickstart', 'milk', 'human', 'kindness.The', 'parents', 'are', 'dishonest', 'dealings', 'Kevin', 'bad', 'behaviour', 'lack', 'empathy', 'subtle', 'malevolence.Eva', 'up', 'negative', 'behavoiur', 'never', 'really', 'even', 'should.Franklin', 'JC', 'Reilly', 'head', 'sand', 'pretends', 'everything', 'hunky-dory', 'overcompensating', 'Eva', 'lack', 'affection', 'Kevin', 'Kevin', 'two', 'exposes', 'weakness.Kevin', 'Damien', 'arrogant', 'cruel', 'mother', 'sister', 'disrespects', 'dad', 'also', 'vulnerable', 'context', 'vast', 'cunning', 'manipulative', 'evil.Kevin', 'picked', 'up', 'very', 'young', 'age', 'cause', 'mother', 'loss', 'freedom', 'perfectly', 'capable', 'talking', 'intentionally', 'back', 'language', 'development', 'spite', ""n't"", 'want', 'please', 'Similarly', 'perfectly', 'capable', 'bowel', 'control', 'toilet', 'training', 'age', '6', 'still', 'nappies', 'making', 'life', 'intentionally', 'as', 'awkward', 'possible.Of', 'course', 'due', 'problems', 'running', 'time', 'slashing', 'budget', 'Ramsay', 'had', 'concertina', 'story', 'flashback', 'structure', 'leave', 'out', 'epistolary', 'nature', 'novel', 'stripping', 'down', 'literary', 'conceit', 'giving', 'delayed', 'reveal', 'net', 'curtains', 'veiling', 'worst', 'Kevin', 'misdemeanours', 'get', 'splintering', 'time', 'symbolism', 'imagery', 'colour', 'red', 'tomatoes', 'paint', 'soup', 'cans', 'immerse', 'tormented', 'fragmented', 'memories', 'woman', 'who', 'depicted', 'victim', 'nailed', 'teeth-grindingly', 'reluctantly', 'motherhood', 'monstrous', 'nature', 'evolving', 'son', 'Jasper', 'Newell', 'Ezra', 'Miller', 'are', 'brilliant', 'younger', 'older', 'Kevins.This', 'not', 'treated', 'issue', 'film', 'are', 'given', 'subjective', 'view', 'Eva', 'looking', 'back', 'asking', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'Kevin', 'conception', 'murders', 'story', 'family', 'Eva', 'instantly', 'connection', 'daughter', 'way', 'never', 'did', 'Kevin', 'jealous', 'whatever', 'always', 'torment', 'Eva', 'further', 'daughter', 'eye', 'Kevin', 'not', 'who', 'then', 'Kevin', 'constantly', 'Swinton', 'part', 'superbly', 'well', 'one', 'anxiety', 'coldness', 'tension', 'cinematography', 'sound', 'design', 'are', 'beautiful', 'editing', 'just', 'excellent', 'However', 'where', 'film', 'down', 'perhaps', 'plot', 'execution', 'story', ""'re"", 'left', 'almost', 'wondering', 'what', 'entire', 'purpose', 'film', 'was', 'impressionistic', 'rendition', 'mother', 'experience', 'nature', 'unconditional', 'love', 'confused', 'complex', 'damaged', 'disturbed', 'child.Brave', 'ultimately', 'flawed']",We Need to Talk About Kevin

I can see where the erratic film-style could make one person hate the movie and feel like their about to have a seizure, while another person feels hypnotized.What I mean by ""film"" approach is the unnerving bizarre angles, jarring music and sound at odd moments, color distortion to frames of the movie, skewed and unexplained timeline, very little talking from actors, etc. These in my opinion are all Hallmarks of a ""film"" not a movie.Because of this my husband hated ""We Need to Talk About Kevin."" I on the other hand, thought the ""film"" approach made things unnerving and uncomfortable for the viewer..... which is EXACTLY how you need to feel watching the material you are watching. The content of the movie is intensely disturbing so the combined effect is genious.The bouncing back and forth with flashbacks, screaming child - then quiet seemingly evil child, violent and raw behaviors, lack of communication between the parents - it is all meant to leave you with frayed nerves so that you can't swallow what is happening to Tilda Swinton's character any more than she can. It builds you up climactically too as you discover the horror of what Kevin does - while seeing that no one did anything to stop it, and debating with yourself if there was anything that could ever have been done.After the movie was over, I felt uncomfortable and disturbed.

I didn't like feeling that way....... but I have to admit that the directors and Tilda Swinton did an astounding job to have left me with such a lasting impression and effect.This is not a movie you watch over and over.

1529447,A3AUECYM0M0YSX,B007C3TVEY,The Man in the Hathaway Shirt,"[7, 9]","This is one of those movies where we're all supposed to be overwhelmed and devastated to get lots of people to rate the review helpful--to react, in other words, like a trained seal. But it's by not reacting like a trained seal that a review is really helpful. Yes, the film is ""shocking"" in the vein of Hard Candy, a movie they talk about in the supplements on this DVD. But like Hard Candy, I'm not sure, fine acting aside, what I'm supposed to get out of this. I'm aware there are ""no easy answers""; they remind us of this in the supplementary materials several times. But what I found were no answers. Okay, Eva wasn't a great mother. In any number of ways mine wasn't much better, but I didn't turn out like Kevin. Similarly, there are kids from loving homes who end up psychopaths, and kids from terrible homes who go on to win Nobel Prizes. The film didn't shed any light on this phenomenon. Maybe it can't be done, maybe it's too tall an order. But then, again, what exactly am I supposed to take away from this movie, beyond Tilda Swinton's fine performance, the kid staring like someone from a Goth film (""I'm evil! Hate me!""), and John C. Reilly being John C. Reilly, which he seems to make a pretty good living doing.Is Eva a bad mom? Not exactly. She's not great, but she's not utterly reprehensible either. She isn't loving, though we don't really get into why. She seems distant from everybody. At first we think this is because of the horrific events that have taken place--she's in shock. Except, when we flash back, she's largely that way then too. The only time we see her happy is in the early scenes in the streets of New York during a rain storm, early in her marriage to Franklin, in her carefree days. After her first child is born, it's all downhill--dirty diapers and tantrums and all that.Except, except...she has a second child. And this little girl seems to turn out fine. (However, the filmmakers kind of cheat, because they give us no scenes of Eva raising the girl, no toss-me-the-ball bits with her; she just arrives fully formed and happy and so a crucial issue this movie purports to examine is actually side-stepped.) If we just saw the family with the girl as their child, we'd conclude this is about as perfect a family as families can be. If we just saw them with Kevin, we'd conclude it was a living gothic nightmare. So again, what exactly am I supposed to take away? Is Kevin or the girl the fluke? Is there no such thing as a fluke? Is it a sheer role of the dice every time? Instead the movie spends its time with ""shock shots"" of blood and tomatoes and whirring curtains and flashing police lights, over and over. (The middle act wore a little thin.)Kevin was a sociopath from the get-go. Even as a toddler he threw out gazes of deep hostility and rage. As a grade-schooler, he shot looks of hatred at his mother, sabotaging the family's domestic calm with acts of vandalism and violence. Again, what are we supposed to take away? The director says she wanted to explore the issue of ""nature vs. nurture."" The author of the book on which the film is based says she hit 40 and wanted to decide once and for all if she wanted to have a child (one concludes the answer was ""No""), so she wrote the novel as an exploration of that. I don't see any *exploration.* Point of view and insight are sacrificed for heavy-handed shots of blood and tomatoes-as-blood, jerky camerawork and thudding subwoofer effects (will filmmakers never get tired of these?) and a twisted narrative that's somewhere between The Matrix and Citizen Kane except in this case it's unnecessary, serving to obfuscate rather than clarify. At several points after we went over some story point for the sixth time I felt like saying to the director, ""Yeah, yeah, I get it."" Other times the ping-ponging worked well and built tension. So it's a mixed bag--overused in some spots, effective in others.In one scene the kid says to mom, in reply to her question of why: ""There is no point. That's the point."" *Now* you tell us? We know this sort of thing happens. We've heard before that it's ""inexplicable,"" ""beyond comprehension,"" etc. We've all seen Dateline NBC. We come to a project like this, one that pushes itself to the front for attention, for more than a mere Dateline-style dramatization, because Dateline's already covered that. WNtTAK is stylishly-made (especially if spattered blood is your thing), and beautifully-shot by Seamus McGarvey, who also lensed The Hours. But thought-provoking? No. Very tricked-out in technique, but when you strip it away, the underlying text is pretty ordinary. By the way, I thought the same was true of that other ""shocking,"" ""stunning"" film festival darling, Hard Candy. See it for Ellen Page's performance, but the film itself? Meh. It really pains me to not lavish praise on We Need To Talk About Kevin, because I love scrappy indie projects where the producers struggled for years and finally made the film through pluck and grit and resourcefulness. But not all such films turn out great.Supplements are interesting. Interviews with everyone involved (where they talk up a generally better movie than they served) and a special sit-down with Tilda at some sort of festival honoring her. I found her conversation about her life and art much more interesting than the film itself. There's also an appropriately-shocking trailer.",2,Not sure exactly what to take away here...,1340928000,"06 29, 2012",2012,5382,"['one', 'movies', 'where', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'overwhelmed',

1529449,A2W8H62ICF3OHJ,B007C3TVEY,"T. Hunt ""wasabi crush""","[2, 2]","""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" is a 2011 British-American drama directed by Lynne Ramsay.  It follows Eva, played by Tida Swinton, as she struggles against the current that is her impassive and morbidly troubled son, Kevin.  Sharply wrought, I've not seen a film this striking in long while.I read the novel late last year and appreciated the idea but became disenchanted with the author by the book's end.  Her expansive vocabulary and scathingly written protagonist were initially addictive but I never quite was able to step out of the author and into her story - she reads as a bit pretentious and I wasn't entirely convinced that this was a character design.  Thus, it was occasionally tiring but I stuck it out and felt rewarded for doing so.  Fat trimmed, Shriver's story is uniquely disturbing and houses a startling conclusion that screamed to be stamped forever on celluloid.  Thankfully, the director's translation is exceptional.  I'm not familiar with Ramsay's work but I plan to be.  She cooked the novel down to its most fundamental elements and then handed it back in better shape than she found it.  The dialogue is minimal, the camerawork gorgeous, and the soundtrack is oddly brilliant.Call it a thriller.  I'm in.First and foremost, Eva was cast exceptionally well.  The part called for a woman worn and skeletal Tida Swinton's bulbous fish pupils bored through the role as if the character was written for her specifically.  Eva birthed a monster and Swinton exemplified the weight of this load beautifully.  They couldn't have found a more haunting actress; she absolutely made this film.I was also impressed with Ezra Miller as Kevin.  There were two children cast to play Kevin in his younger years and they stared as menacingly as needed, but it was Ezra that brought a chilled and convincing depth to the character.  His involvement here was a treat and I'll be watching for his future roles.The one actor I wasn't particularly impressed with, however, was John C. Reilly as Franklin.  I understand that he was drafted to play the naive' husband and father, but he just felt dopey and unbelievable to me.  I realize that they wanted to pull in a main name for the role, but I think he hurt the film by detracting from its focal point.  Someone with a lesser name, in my opinion, would have been a better fit.  Reilly's inclusion is my sole reason for not giving this film 5 stars.Still, if you're considering the purchase and are interested in the content, just do it.  This film's genre, often built clumsily around its little sociopaths, is dominated largely by blatant characters and flagrantly repetitive themes.  And it's getting old.  ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" is a step in a more admirable direction.  Without giving the story away, I'll advise that the subject matter is relevant and certainly worth your time.  I would warn you, however, that the synopsis attached doesn't quite convey how unsettling the content actually is.  The violence is subtle and tastefully executed but there are a few graphic scenes, so you're aware.  If you're hoping only for a poignant drama, proceed with caution.But I do highly recommend watching this movie - its message is sensational.Thank you for your time.- t",4,A cunning reduction of the novel.,1338422400,"05 31, 2012",2012,3233,"['Need', 'Talk', 'Kevin', '2011', 'British-American', 'drama', 'directed', 'Lynne', 'Ramsay', 'Eva', 'played', 'Tida', 'Swinton', 'current', 'impassive', 'morbidly', 'troubled', 'son', 'Kevin', 'Sharply', 'wrought', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'striking', 'long', 'while.I', 'read', 'novel', 'late', 'last', 'year', 'appreciated', 'idea', 'became', 'disenchanted', 'author', 'book', 'end', 'expansive', 'vocabulary', 'scathingly', 'written', 'protagonist', 'were', 'initially', 'addictive', 'never', 'quite', 'was', 'able', 'step', 'out', 'author', 'story', 'bit', 'pretentious', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'convinced', 'was', 'character', 'design', 'Thus', 'was', 'occasionally', 'tiring', 'stuck', 'out', 'felt', 'rewarded', 'doing', 'so', 'Fat', 'trimmed', 'Shriver', 'story', 'uniquely', 'disturbing', 'houses', 'startling', 'conclusion', 'screamed', 'be', 'stamped', 'forever', 'celluloid', 'Thankfully', 'director', 'translation', 'exceptional', ""'m"", 'not', 'familiar', 'Ramsay', 'work', 'plan', 'be', 'cooked', 'novel', 'down', 'most', 'fundamental', 'elements', 'then', 'handed', 'back', 'better', 'shape', 'found', 'dialogue', 'minimal', 'camerawork', 'gorgeous', 'soundtrack', 'oddly', 'brilliant.Call', 'thriller', ""'m"", 'in.First', 'foremost', 'Eva', 'was', 'cast', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'part', 'called', 'woman', 'worn', 'skeletal', 'Tida', 'Swinton', 'bulbous', 'fish', 'pupils', 'bored', 'role', 'character', 'was', 'written', 'specifically', 'Eva', 'birthed', 'monster', 'Swinton', 'exemplified', 'weight', 'load', 'beautifully', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'found', 'more', 'haunting', 'actress', 'absolutely', 'made', 'film.I', 'was', 'also', 'impressed', 'Ezra', 'Miller', 'Kevin', 'were', 'two', 'children', 'cast', 'play', 'Kevin', 'younger', 'years', 'stared', 'as', 'menacingly', 'needed', 'was', 'Ezra', 'brought', 'chilled', 'convincing', 'depth', 'character', 'involvement', 'here', 'was', 'treat', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'future', 'one', 'actor', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'impressed', 'however', 'was', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'Franklin', 'understand', 'was', 'drafted', 'play', 'naive', 'husband', 'father', 'just', 'felt', 'dopey', 'unbelievable', 'realize', 'wanted', 'pull', 'main', 'name', 'role', 'think', 'film', 'detracting', 'focal', 'point', 'Someone', 'lesser', 'name', 'opinion', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'fit', 'Reilly', 'inclusion', 'sole', 'reason', 'not', 'giving', 'film', '5', 'stars.Still', ""'re"", 'considering', 'purchase', 'are', 'interested', 'content', 'just', 'do', 'film', 'genre', 'often', 'built', 'clumsily', 'little', 'sociopaths', 'dominated', 'largely', 'blatant', 'characters', 'flagrantly', 'repetitive', 'themes', 'getting', 'old', 'Need', 'Talk', 'Kevin', 'step', 'more', 'admirable', 'direction', 'giving', 'story', 'away', ""'ll"", 'advise', 'subject', 'matter', 'relevant', 'certainly', 'time', 'would', 'warn', 'however', 'synopsis', 'attached', ""n't"", 'quite', 'convey', 'how', 'unsettling', 'content', 'actually', 'violence', 'subtle', 'tastefully', 'executed', 'are', 'few', 'graphic', 'scenes', ""'re"", 'aware', ""'re"", 'hoping', 'only', 'poignant', 'drama', 'proceed', 'caution.But', 'do', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'movie', 'message', 'sensational.Thank', 'time.-', 't']",We Need to Talk About Kevin
1529450,A373R1CJT7JEKT,B007C3TVEY,titania86,"[1, 1]","Eva Khatchadourian's life has completely changed since the incident involving her son Kevin at his school. She used to be a successful travel writer and now she took any job that would have her (in this case a clerk in a travel agency). She used to have a family in a large luxurious house, but now lives alone in a small squalid house. The people of her town are largely hostile towards her, splashing her house with red paint and even attacking her in the street. Kevin nears eighteen and she regularly visits him in jail despite not having much to talk about. Eva reflects upin her strained  relationship with Kevin and his complacent father who dismissed all of her concerns as she struggles to put some semblance of a life back together in the face of depression and the judgment of the people around her.I am really impressed with this film. It examines this fictional situation that has been seen countless times in the news over the years and simply presents pieces of the story as the film goes along, allowing the viewer to come up with their own rationalizations and judgments. There aren't any clear answers about anything because there are none in real life. It makes for a thought provoking and depressing film that has stayed with me. A major theme in the film is the lack of communication in the whole situation. Despite the title of the film, no one actually talks about Kevin. Every attempt Eva made to voice concern about him was dismissed by medical professionals and her husband. After her concerns went unheard, she stopped trying to voice them. This lack of communications permeates all aspects of Eva's life. She never really talks to the people who were devastated by Kevin's actions (which may have made her feel less alone and ostracized) or to her husband about her doubts about being a mother and wanting to travel more (which may have made their relationship and marriage better) or even to Kevin. It's actually quite sad how a healthy dose of communication could have helped a lot of the situations here.I loved Tilda Swinton's portrayal of Eva. She comes off as a sympathetic and human character. It seems as if she didn't really want to be a mother right from the beginning. She seemed detached from the other mothers in the pregnancy classes, abhors her constantly crying infant son, and even tells him that every day she wakes up she wishes she was in France. Unfortunately, society still considers it a taboo when a woman doesn't like being a mother or doesn't want children, so this portrayal is rarely seen. Many would see Eva as a terrible person, but motherhood really isn't for everyone. I'm sure there are many women out there that regret having children because our society puts forth that all women should want or like children and have a maternal instinct. Eva made some mistakes along the way, but she really loved Kevin and tried to do her best even when he was at his worst. Over time, she grew scared of him and knew that anything she said against him would be dismissed and would make her look irrational or cruel. In the aftermath of the incident, Eva takes a lot of grief and violence from the parents of Kevin's school mates. Instead of protesting this or even talking to them, she quietly takes the abuse and moves on. She believes Kevin's actions to be her fault and accepts the vitriol of others because she believes she deserves it. Eva is a flawed person, but is simply human and undeserving of such punishment.Kevin is a frightening character. Through the course of the film, he grew from a difficult infant to a sociopathic  teenager. Talented at manipulation, he uses the people to his advantage at every opportunity even at a young age. His relationships with Eva is complex and interesting. She is the only person who sees him for who he truly is, but he punishes her at every turn because he knows no one will believe her. His violent act is designed to hurt his mother in the deepest possible way, even going so far as to reference the children's book she read him when he was sick. The reason why Kevin ended up as he did is an obvious question and doesn't have a clear answer.The way the film is presented is disorienting at first. It starts after the incident but then constantly flashes back to life before from Kevin's birth to the incident in a fairly linear order. I would recommend watching the film at least twice because it makes much more sense the second time and more nuanced things can be recognized when not hindered by trying to figure out where every scene fits into the story timeline. The cinematography is striking.

It's that there's ""no guidebook"" to being a parent. You just have to do your best and learn as you go. That assumes a level of parental instinct exists on even the most basic level, but what if there isn't? What if you hate your child? What if your child hates you and everything else just as much?In We Need to Talk About Kevin, that emotional deficit leads to nightmarish consequences, the kind that would leave any rational parent breaking out in a drenching cold sweat. When we first meet Eva(Tilda Swinton), she seems adrift in this world. For unknown reasons she's hated and ridiculed by the people she meets on the street. In the heavily used flashbacks we see her during a happier time, spirited and in lust's grip with Franklin(John C. Reilly), the new man in her life. A particularly blissful evening leads to an unexpected pregnancy, marriage, and a fresh start in the suburbs.From there it's immediately downhill, as their son, Kevin, is a handful from the start. Eva can't stop him from crying, to the point where she takes walks near construction sites just to drown him out. He doesn't listen to her, going out of his way to do the opposite of what she wants. She has no connection with the boy, and as he gets older nothing seems to change. The bond isn't there. She's not built for it, and even if she was, Kevin wouldn't want it. In time he only grows more violent and hateful, especially towards her. The dynamic changes as a little sister enters the family, with Kevin having someone completely defenseless to terrorize. Franklin, a clueless schmo of a husband thinks it's no big deal and that it'll pass. He has no idea how wrong he is, about as wrong as a parent can be about anything.Marking the long awaited return of Lynne Ramsay as director and based on the novel by Lionel Shriver, the film poses an interesting nature vs. nurture question wrapped in a real life horror story . Was it Eva's lack of maternal guidance that leads Kevin down his murderous path? Or was he just a bad seed destined to go off on a killing spree? No answers are forthcoming, and that never really seems to be the point.Ramsay, who has been away from the camera for nearly a decade, goes a little too far trying to leave a signature fingerprint on the film's look, bathing it in off-putting colors, specifically heavy reds to foreshadow the upcoming violence. The use of flashbacks and time jumping are overdone and add little to the story's impact.  Ramsay's artistic flourishes, including some of the more dreamlike elements as we flash through Eva's memories, feel tacked on and unnecessary.As many of Tilda Swinton's films tend to be, their success rests solely on her considerable acting talents. Here she is mesmerizing as Eva, a conflicted woman tortured by her own failings, appalled by her hatred for her own son. These are the types of roles Swinton excels at, the ones no other actress would dare to undertake. No one else could play this role and be as believable and haunting as Swinton is. Ezra Miller is woefully miscast as Kevin, however. A likable actor who has done good things before(he's great in City Island), he seems to be fighting to stay on Swinton's level, but ends up snarling and smirking like a bad comic book villain.We Need to Talk About Kevin is a tough film to endure, not because it's bad but because Swinton's performance is so uncomfortably raw.

In fact, not just someone else, but your own son.The film opens on a dream sequence that I struggle to see the relevance of even now and, when it ends, we are introduced to a waking Eva Katchadourian (played by Tilda Swinton). Eva is living in a run-down house that has recently been vandalized along with her car. Rather than report it, Eva (Swinton) merely cleans the windshield and departs on a search for employment. She was once a successful travel writer but has experienced great difficulty finding work since her son Kevin (played by Ezra Miller) took it upon himself to carry out a massacre in his high school. Kevin was a difficult child from infancy, crying incessantly at all hours while Eva's husband Franklin (played by John C. Reilly) is out of the house working. As Kevin grows older, the difficulties only increase. He doesn't speak or appear to understand when others do as a toddler. When he finally does speak, he refuses to be toilet trained. This frustrates Eva till she throws Kevin against a wall, breaking his arm. It wasn't clear, at least to me, whether it was intentional or not, but Kevin claims he fell and returns home willing and able to use the toilet. Franklin (Reilly) is amazed and delighted while Eva is consumed by guilt. When their second child is born, things only get worse.Swinton's character is far from perfect, but on some level, the audience sympathizes with her. Both as a mother whose son is clearly more disturbed than her husband is capable of realizing and as the widow being harassed on a nearly constant basis for a crime she didn't commit. Reilly's character is infuriating, but only viewing the problem from Eva's eyes makes it a lot easier to see than it would be for someone spending most of the day outside the home. Prior to watching this film, my only knowledge of Miller's acting was when he guest-starred as the precocious son of a wealthy, absentee father with substance abuse issues on the USA Network show Royal Pains.

1529456,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B007C3TVEY,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" may fascinate you, but not in the way you want it. Some may call it a horror, but definitely not a usual kind of horror. Not many horror movies would employ narrative strategies that are ferociously disorienting like this. The film is about a former travel writer Eva Khatchadourian (Tilda Swinton) and her son Kevin, whose increasing malicious behavior torments his mother.Told in the chronologically jumbled order (with fragmented images, some of which could be results of the heroine's own imagination), ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" asks us to pick up the pieces and put them into the right places in the storyline. The task interests us at first, but as we come to see the whole picture, we notice that the film does not have much to say.The mother-son relationship that went awry is one of the film's main themes, and the filmmakers should be thankful for the cast especially Tilda Swinton, without whose excellent performances as Kevin's mother the film would have been an unwatchable mess. In fact, whatever you feel about her character, Tilda Swinton (who eerily resembles Ezra Miller as teenage Kevin) is the reason you should see the film.This is the third feature film from Lynne Ramsay, who directed ""Ratcatcher"" (1999) and ""Morvern"" (2002). I wasn't impressed with any of them though I admit she is quite good at creating atmospheric and surreal images that are both comfortable and uncomfortable at the same time. After her unsuccessful attempt to adapt ""The Lovely Bones"" (which Peter Jackson took over), Lynne Ramsay comes back. And she has not changed, for better or worse.Watch for Tilda Swinton, whose great performances barely covers the fact that the film actually lacks depth with its unconvincing characters.

1529459,A1XMHK9HN5MW2H,B007C3TVEY,Victoria J. Dennison,"[0, 0]","Excellent film.  The acting was fantastic and so was the director.  This is one movie that should have walked off with all the awards.  I would not call this an entertaining movie, because it is not.  It's a heavy duty drama that focuses on a subject that few people wish to examine in depth.  It's not a ""weepy"" or ""melodramatic"" drama. It's not a love story, its a chronicle of tragedy.  It tends to put the viewer more in a state of horrific wonder as they watch the screen. There are no light moments.The movie is disturbing and bleak, but then again it's about a part of life that very few people have to deal with or even attempt to justify; let alone witness it up close and personal.  The movie is so realistic that its like watching a case study in which a family unravels; and hits its zenith when a violent act of rage is committed by the teenage son.  The devil did not make him do it, his rage did.  There is no forgiveness displayed in this film by anyone... it is a brutal.Well, it's a five Star movie, that's for sure.  If you are empathetic or very sensitive, it is disturbing. Just keep telling yourself ""its only a movie"" or don't watch it.

1529460,AA3Q5TMI1J0XU,B007C3TVEY,Violets,"[0, 0]","This is a film with excellent acting, well done. The mother and the son are especially good. If taken as a horror film it works very well.The idea of the 'bad' child, 'born bad' etc. is really just a way to protect us from being fully aware of the existence of child abuse and neglect, and it's consequences. To ask 'nature or nurture' in light of the clear connections between abuse/neglect and the creation of sociopaths is like wrapping a blindfold around our eyes because what we see is too painful and frightening. It is also part of protecting ourselves from recognizing the amount and scope of horrors that chidlren endure and have historically endured, and to protect us from awareness of our own unresolved painful/traumatizing experiences from childhood etc. To protect the idea of the 'good Mother'. The child who isn't loved always thinks that she is 'bad' and it is 'her fault'. When parents divorce, the child thinks it's their fault, or if a parent dies, the same.Warning spoilers ahead:But it does show great progress in that, in this movie, while the son is shown as almost comically evil, there is an ambivalence. The Mother is not shown as being 'good' to the degree we saw in 'The Bad Seed', for instasnce, and the son is shown to have a somewhat 'normal' relationship with his Dad. The Mother is more ambivelent.  And at the end, we see that the son is also mystified by his actions-ONLY however, AFTER he has been 'punished' so that we are relieved of our own inner sense of needing to be 'punished' for being 'bad' i.e. threatening to the Mother/Father in some way. A reenactment of our orginal traumas etc.Still, c'mon, the son who KILLS his Dad and sister???? Just because he was 'born that way'???? A LOT of psychological projections and emotional material in this film. Let's face it, the boy who kills his classmates is someone who was bullied mercilessly, or, even when we cannot find the exact reason, it is almost certainly due to abuse/neglect trauma etc, whether by parents or others.",3,Interesting though essentially flawed,1393977600,"03 5, 2014",2014,2017,"['film', 'excellent', 'acting', 'well', 'done', 'mother', 'son', 'are', 'especially', 'good', 'taken', 'horror', 'film', 'very', 'well.The', 'idea', ""'bad"", 'child', 'bad', 'etc', 'really', 'just', 'way', 'protect', 'being', 'fully', 'aware', 'existence', 'child', 'abuse', 'neglect', 'consequences', 'ask', ""'nature"", 'nurture', 'light', 'clear', 'connections', 'abuse/neglect', 'creation', 'sociopaths', 'wrapping', 'blindfold', 'eyes', 'what', 'see', 'too', 'painful', 'frightening', 'also', 'part', 'protecting', 'recognizing', 'amount', 'scope', 'horrors', 'chidlren', 'endure', 'have', 'historically', 'endured', 'protect', 'awareness', 'own', 'unresolved', 'painful/traumatizing', 'experiences', 'childhood', 'etc', 'protect', 'idea', ""'good"", 'Mother', 'child', 'who', ""n't"", 'loved', 'always', ""'bad"", ""'her"", 'fault', 'When', 'parents', 'divorce', 'child', 'fault', 'parent', 'same.Warning', 'spoilers', 'ahead', 'show', 'great', 'progress', 'movie', 'son', 'shown', 'almost', 'comically', 'evil', 'ambivalence', 'Mother', 'not', 'shown', 'being', ""'good"", 'degree', 'saw', ""'The"", 'Bad', 'Seed', 'instasnce', 'son', 'shown', 'have', 'somewhat', ""'normal"", 'relationship', 'Dad', 'Mother', 'more', 'ambivelent', 'end', 'see', 'son', 'also', 'mystified', 'actions-ONLY', 'however', 'AFTER', 'been', ""'punished"", 'so', 'are', 'relieved', 'own', 'inner', 'sense', 'needing', 'be', ""'punished"", 'being', ""'bad"", 'i.e', 'threatening', 'Mother/Father', 'way', 'reenactment', 'orginal', 'traumas', 'etc.Still', ""c'mon"", 'son', 'who', 'Dad', 'sister', 'Just', 'was', ""'born"", 'way', 'LOT', 'psychological', 'projections', 'emotional', 'material', 'film', 'Let', 'face', 'boy', 'who', 'classmates', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'bullied', 'mercilessly', 'even', 'when', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'exact', 'reason', 'almost', 'certainly', 'due', 'abuse/neglect', 'trauma', 'etc', 'parents', 'others']",We Need to Talk About Kevin

The cast is marvelous with strong performances from Tilda Swindon as Eva Kevin's mother who never truly bonds with her son and John C. Reilly as Kevin's father who can only see the good in his son.I will admit, of course, that I'm a bit biased when it regards this material with a family member who suffers from much of the same disorder as Kevin does although the outcome was not as tragic.Director/co-writer Lynne Ramsey does a marvelous job with realizing the characters from Lionel Shriver's novel and helping her cast create realistic and tragic characters.The Blu-ray receives an exceptionally good transfer nicely capturing the natural looking cinematography  handled by Seamus McGarvey. Detail and color remains strong throughout the presentation of the film. If you just want to watch the film in standard DVD I don't think it'll suffer but the Blu has superior depth, detail and color reproduction.Audio has a nice, subtle surround mix that gradual envelopes the listener but keep in mind that this is a dialogue driven movie.The special features a featurette ""Behind the Scenes of Kevin"" where the cast and crew get a chance to discuss the material and their approach to it. We also get some additional footage from the opening sequence at the tomato festival in Spain as well as an interview with actress Swindow from Telluride.A disturbing but powerful drama driven by a number of great performances including Erza Miller as the teenage Kevin (although to all the actors who portray him--to their credit they are all great in their performances)and Tilda Swindon as his mother, ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" isn't a feel good movie but sometimes we need films like this to remind us of tragedy that sometimes embraces our lives without ever letting go.",5,Harrowing but powerful drama about the impact of a sociopathic son on a family and community,1338595200,"06 2, 2012",2012,2016,"['powerful', 'disquieting', 'film', 'Need', 'Talk', 'Kevin', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'gradually', 'story', 'family', 'sociopathic', 'son', 'Kevin', 'impact', 'actions', 'survivor', 'wake', 'horrible', 'tragedy', 'cast', 'marvelous', 'strong', 'performances', 'Tilda', 'Swindon', 'Eva', 'Kevin', 'mother', 'who', 'never', 'truly', 'bonds', 'son', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'Kevin', 'father', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'see', 'good', 'son.I', 'will', 'admit', 'course', ""'m"", 'bit', 'biased', 'when', 'material', 'family', 'member', 'who', 'much', 'same', 'disorder', 'Kevin', 'outcome', 'was', 'not', 'tragic.Director/co-writer', 'Lynne', 'Ramsey', 'marvelous', 'job', 'realizing', 'characters', 'Lionel', 'Shriver', 'novel', 'helping', 'cast', 'create', 'realistic', 'tragic', 'characters.The', 'Blu-ray', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'transfer', 'nicely', 'capturing', 'natural', 'looking', 'cinematography', 'handled', 'Seamus', 'McGarvey', 'Detail', 'color', 'strong', 'presentation', 'film', 'just', 'want', 'watch', 'film', 'standard', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'suffer', 'Blu', 'superior', 'depth', 'detail', 'color', 'reproduction.Audio', 'nice', 'subtle', 'surround', 'mix', 'gradual', 'listener', 'keep', 'mind', 'dialogue', 'driven', 'movie.The', 'special', 'features', 'featurette', 'Scenes', 'Kevin', 'where', 'cast', 'crew', 'get', 'chance', 'discuss', 'material', 'approach', 'also', 'get', 'additional', 'footage', 'opening', 'sequence', 'tomato', 'festival', 'Spain', 'as', 'well', 'interview', 'actress', 'Swindow', 'Telluride.A', 'disturbing', 'powerful', 'drama', 'driven', 'number', 'great', 'performances', 'including', 'Erza', 'Miller', 'teenage', 'Kevin', 'actors', 'who', 'portray', 'credit', 'are', 'great', 'performances', 'Tilda', 'Swindon', 'mother', 'Need', 'Talk', 'Kevin', ""n't"", 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'need', 'films', 'remind', 'tragedy', 'sometimes', 'lives', 'ever', 'letting', 'go']",We Need to Talk About Kevin
