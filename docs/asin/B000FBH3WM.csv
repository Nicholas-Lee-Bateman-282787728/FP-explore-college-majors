987493,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B000FBH3WM,andy8047,"[51, 56]","I give this review four stars because one of the original cast is gone now. I am speaking of David Garrison who left Married...With Children in the middle of the sitcom's fourth season to continue broadway roles. It was written that Garrison's character Steve Rhoades,who had lost his job as an accountant,unmercifully left his beautiful,endearing wife Marcy(Amanda Bearse) and became a forest ranger. So Marcy is still single until mid-season when she marries playboy Jefferson D'Arcy(Happy Days veteran Ted McGinley) in her sleep!(she woke up with a wedding ring on one of her fingers and not the same one she wore during her marriage to Steve). The Bundys hold a backyard wedding for Mr. and Mrs. D'Arcy. Peggy(Katey Sagal) plays her accordion at the wedding. Bud(David Faustino) tried numerous times to score with Marcy,post-Steve and pre-Jefferson. Other highlights this season include the Bundys in a brawl with another family of four during Labor Day weekend gridlock. Al(Ed O'Neill) and Kelly(Christina Applegate) spend time on their living room sofa while they both battle nasal congestion. The Bundys in court with a civil lawsuit against someone they had a road collision with. Al is prepared with a briefcase that will contain the lawsuit cash. Dr. Joyce Brothers,a former advice columnist,played the presiding judge. Marcy even testified at the trial(she witnessed a Mercedes was involved in the collision). She whined and complained about that very same car that Steve had(""He left me like parsley on a plate at a truck stop diner!""). Kelly becomes a model for an automobile commercial. Gilligan's Island veteran Tina Louise plays the casting director. Also,Al makes Peggy jealous by receiving numerous attention from shapely beauties who witness him lifting a heavy couch. Also,for the beauties' sake,he changes his ways! He showers and brushes his teeth regularly! He even quit wearing his Hanes briefs! Peggy wanted the old Al back. And Al went back to his old,usual self. Al takes a job as a night watchman at his alma mater,Polk High School where Bud is a student and Kelly and Peggy are alumni of themselves. There's the two-part ""You Better Shop Around"",which is available on Most Outrageous Episodes,Part 2. The Bundys,in that episode,seek shelter in a supermarket,and Al accidentally becomes the one millionth customer of the day. He stepped ahead of Marcy who was in the checkout line since he only had a pack of chewing gum. As Al was checked out,balloons and confetti fell. Marcy was bitching that she was originally the next in line. Al says to her,""You still are!"". Then Al checks out a headline in the National Enquirer which reads ""Steve Rhoades to marry Cher"". Marcy couldn't wait to check out that headline about her ex-husband. The other episodes are great. McGinley was billed as a guest star this season,since he had not joined MWC at the beginning. He guest-starred in the season 4 two-part episode ""It's A Bundyful Christmas"" which Fox aired as a whole on December 24,1989. McGinley's character was Norman Jablonski,who appeared in a dream that Al had. In the dream,Norman was the household patriarch instead of Al! 5 down,6 to go.",4,"Welcome aboard,Ted!",1144713600,"04 11, 2006",2006,3168,"['give', 'review', 'four', 'stars', 'one', 'original', 'cast', 'gone', 'now', 'am', 'speaking', 'David', 'Garrison', 'who', 'left', 'Married', 'Children', 'middle', 'sitcom', 'fourth', 'season', 'continue', 'broadway', 'roles', 'was', 'written', 'Garrison', 'character', 'Steve', 'Rhoades', 'who', 'had', 'lost', 'job', 'accountant', 'unmercifully', 'left', 'beautiful', 'endearing', 'wife', 'Marcy', 'Amanda', 'Bearse', 'became', 'forest', 'ranger', 'So', 'Marcy', 'still', 'single', 'mid-season', 'when', 'playboy', 'Jefferson', ""D'Arcy"", 'Happy', 'Days', 'veteran', 'Ted', 'McGinley', 'sleep', 'woke', 'up', 'wedding', 'ring', 'one', 'fingers', 'not', 'same', 'one', 'wore', 'marriage', 'Steve', 'Bundys', 'hold', 'backyard', 'wedding', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', ""D'Arcy"", 'Peggy', 'Katey', 'Sagal', 'accordion', 'wedding', 'Bud', 'David', 'Faustino', 'tried', 'numerous', 'times', 'score', 'Marcy', 'post-Steve', 'pre-Jefferson', 'Other', 'highlights', 'season', 'include', 'Bundys', 'brawl', 'family', 'four', 'Labor', 'Day', 'weekend', 'gridlock', 'Al', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'Kelly', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'spend', 'time', 'living', 'room', 'sofa', 'battle', 'nasal', 'congestion', 'Bundys', 'court', 'civil', 'lawsuit', 'someone', 'had', 'road', 'collision', 'Al', 'prepared', 'briefcase', 'will', 'contain', 'lawsuit', 'cash', 'Dr.', 'Joyce', 'Brothers', 'former', 'advice', 'columnist', 'played', 'presiding', 'judge', 'Marcy', 'even', 'testified', 'trial', 'witnessed', 'Mercedes', 'was', 'involved', 'collision', 'whined', 'complained', 'very', 'same', 'car', 'Steve', 'had', 'left', 'parsley', 'plate', 'truck', 'stop', 'diner', 'Kelly', 'model', 'automobile', 'commercial', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'veteran', 'Tina', 'Louise', 'casting', 'director', 'Also', 'Al', 'Peggy', 'jealous', 'receiving', 'numerous', 'attention', 'shapely', 'beauties', 'who', 'witness', 'lifting', 'heavy', 'couch', 'Also', 'beauties', 'sake', 'ways', 'teeth', 'regularly', 'even', 'quit', 'wearing', 'Hanes', 'briefs', 'Peggy', 'wanted', 'old', 'Al', 'back', 'Al', 'went', 'back', 'old', 'usual', 'self', 'Al', 'job', 'night', 'watchman', 'alma', 'mater', 'Polk', 'High', 'School', 'where', 'Bud', 'student', 'Kelly', 'Peggy', 'are', 'alumni', 'two-part', 'Better', 'Shop', 'available', 'Most', 'Outrageous', 'Episodes', 'Part', '2', 'Bundys', 'episode', 'seek', 'shelter', 'supermarket', 'Al', 'accidentally', 'one', 'millionth', 'customer', 'day', 'stepped', 'ahead', 'Marcy', 'who', 'was', 'checkout', 'line', 'only', 'had', 'pack', 'chewing', 'gum', 'Al', 'was', 'checked', 'out', 'balloons', 'confetti', 'fell', 'Marcy', 'was', 'bitching', 'was', 'originally', 'next', 'line', 'Al', 'still', 'are', 'Then', 'Al', 'out', 'headline', 'National', 'Enquirer', 'Steve', 'Rhoades', 'marry', 'Cher', 'Marcy', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'check', 'out', 'headline', 'ex-husband', 'other', 'episodes', 'are', 'great', 'McGinley', 'was', 'billed', 'guest', 'star', 'season', 'had', 'not', 'joined', 'MWC', 'beginning', 'guest-starred', 'season', '4', 'two-part', 'episode', 'Bundyful', 'Christmas', 'Fox', 'aired', 'whole', 'December', '24,1989', 'McGinley', 'character', 'was', 'Norman', 'Jablonski', 'who', 'appeared', 'dream', 'Al', 'had', 'dream', 'Norman', 'was', 'household', 'patriarch', 'instead', 'Al', '5', 'down,6', 'go']",Married... with Children: Season 5

987495,A281387UUS2IN5,B000FBH3WM,Beantown Jim,"[0, 0]","This was one of the middle seasons of MWC(Married with Children) and as with most comedy series, one of the better years.  I won't give a litany of the shows one by one as other reviewers have done that.By this, the 5th season, we are in full Bundy form.  Noone eats or drinks, no practical shopping, and no friends of any value.  It is total nihilism, a cynical view of middle America (outside Chicago) with undertones of dysfunction, sex, humor and inadequacy.The star, shoe salesman Al, has no interest in his hot wife, his much hotter neighbor, his job, or life.  The wife, Peg, is utterly useless, unwilling to shop for necessities, let alone cook or clean.  The son,Bud,is a good student but socially awkward, to say the least.  The daughter, Kelly, is at her zenith looks wise, but continues to be clueless about life outside of dating a guy...or two...on Friday nights.It's hard to believe that this basic set-up survived the cut for over a decade; it did, though, and was funny until the end.  Perhaps because we are more like this family than the absurd TV families of the 1950's and 1960's, we watch this show and cringe as we also laugh nervously.

987499,A2897WGLPISHM2,B000FBH3WM,Frank Rhee,"[6, 7]","Being a Dutchman, I came into contact with this amazingly funny series years later than the US audiences. That doesn't change the fact, though, that MWC has rapidly become my alltime favourite TV comedy. It always gets me roaring with laughter. Whenever I feel tense or down and out, I put an episode of MWC in the DVD-player and instantaneously feel much better. My kids (a girl and a boy) watch their father howling with laughter with complete and utter amazement every time. They have approximately the same ages as Kelly and Bud --and even look a little bit like them--, but they don't understand (yet) what I find so funny about all this. I guess you need to be married with children for a number of years yourself to truly appreciate MWC. I watched a great number of episodes of MCW on TV, but I missed a lot of them too, so I am profoundly glad that they have now become available on DVD. I won't gripe about the alternative opening music, or the lack of extra's on the DVD. There's only two things I really want: the original, unedited episodes with all the rudeness, violence and insults. Apart from Season 4, we / I got that. But most of all I would like Sony to release the series at a much, much faster rate. I simply cannot wait until 2009 to finally see Season 11. I guess if I have to I will, --what other choice is there?-- but why does it take so extremely long ? Especially since there are no time-consuming extras on the DVD. I bought Season 5 two days ago and I already watched the first 15 episodes. Please Sony, speed it up ! But whatever you do, release the complete series. I only give 4 instead of the possible 5 stars, because the quality of the DVD (sound and image) and the picture transfer are quite good, but the DVD is utterly devoid of any extras.",4,The fun continues,1151971200,"07 4, 2006",2006,1779,"['Being', 'Dutchman', 'came', 'contact', 'amazingly', 'funny', 'series', 'years', 'later', 'US', 'audiences', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'though', 'MWC', 'rapidly', 'become', 'alltime', 'favourite', 'TV', 'comedy', 'always', 'roaring', 'laughter', 'Whenever', 'feel', 'tense', 'down', 'put', 'episode', 'MWC', 'DVD-player', 'instantaneously', 'feel', 'much', 'better', 'kids', 'girl', 'boy', 'watch', 'father', 'howling', 'laughter', 'complete', 'utter', 'amazement', 'time', 'have', 'approximately', 'same', 'ages', 'Kelly', 'Bud', 'even', 'look', 'little', 'bit', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'yet', 'what', 'find', 'so', 'funny', 'guess', 'need', 'be', 'married', 'children', 'number', 'years', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'MWC', 'watched', 'great', 'number', 'episodes', 'MCW', 'TV', 'missed', 'lot', 'too', 'am', 'profoundly', 'glad', 'have', 'now', 'become', 'available', 'DVD', 'wo', ""n't"", 'gripe', 'alternative', 'opening', 'music', 'lack', 'extra', 'DVD', 'only', 'two', 'things', 'really', 'want', 'original', 'unedited', 'episodes', 'rudeness', 'violence', 'insults', 'Apart', 'Season', '4', '/', 'got', 'most', 'would', 'like', 'Sony', 'release', 'series', 'much', 'much', 'faster', 'rate', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'wait', '2009', 'finally', 'see', 'Season', '11', 'guess', 'have', 'will', 'what', 'other', 'choice', 'there', 'why', 'take', 'so', 'extremely', 'long', 'Especially', 'are', 'time-consuming', 'extras', 'DVD', 'bought', 'Season', '5', 'two', 'days', 'ago', 'already', 'watched', 'first', '15', 'episodes', 'Please', 'Sony', 'speed', 'up', 'do', 'release', 'complete', 'series', 'only', 'give', '4', 'instead', 'possible', '5', 'stars', 'quality', 'DVD', 'sound', 'image', 'picture', 'transfer', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'DVD', 'utterly', 'devoid', 'extras']",Married... with Children: Season 5

Kroener,"[3, 4]","Here it is, the fifth season of legendary father and husband Al ""Touchdown"" Bundy and his wonderful co-stars.There really isn't much to say anymore, everybody knows the show, and how could anyone forget its great sense for edgy storylines and poignant cynicism? Married With Children is outstanding in many ways, but a few things really stand out.For one, it's one of the very few shows out there whose appeal and wit almost exclusively come from the characters themselves and the different dynamics they bring to each scene.It's also outstanding that, even though they are mostly centered around Al, you could take any of the six main characters, let a whole show revolve around him/her, and it would result in a classic.Some say season 5 marks the beginning of the end for Married With Children. But I say this is not entirely true. Like every long- running show, it eventually had to change its tone. Such a change is just inevitable if you want to avoid running out of ideas. But, like I said in the Seinfeld review, that's not a decline in quality, that's just a change of style.But I don't want to say that season 5 does everything right. In my opinion, it started something that would haunt later seasons: repetition. It relies on running gags a bit too often. It's always a variation on ""no sex with me"", ""how could I marry you?"", ""Bud will die as a virgin"" or ""my sister does anyone"".But despite this flaw, Al Bundy is still one of the great American idols, and for a reason.The DVD, as usual, is quite poor. No bonuses, no interviews, no inside looks, no nothing. But that shouldn't keep you from getting it; not even the absence of Frank Sinatra's song should.Oh, and here's a little note to Sony: do you realise that this October (2006), Married With Children's 7th season will be released here in Germany?

J Rey,"[3, 6]","Learn the true secrets for domestic bliss from television's favorite dysfunctional family in ""Married... with Children: The Complete Fifth Season"". ""Married... with Children"" is the outrageously funny comedy sitcom that changed our view of the typical family comedy. The comedy series follows the lives of luckless shoe salesman Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill), his dysfunctional family and his bothersome next-door neighbors. In this season, Al resorts to extreme measures to stop a rabbit from ruining his vegetable garden. Marcy (Amanda Bearse) wakes up after a drunken night next to her new husband Jefferson Darcy (Ted McGinley). Al and Peggy (Katey Segal) try to have another baby to win a hefty inheritance. The Bundys and the Darcys face off to become the winners of a $1000 supermarket shopping spree. The fifth season of ""Married... with Children"" marks the introduction of Ted McGinley's character to the show. The season features guest appearances by Pamela Anderson, Matt LeBlanc, Tia Carrere, B.B. King, Dan Castellaneta, Jerry Mathers and Dr. Joyce Brothers. The 100th episode ""Top of the Heap"" was the pilot of an unsuccessful spin-off that only lasted 7 episodes.If you enjoyed the madcap misadventures of the dysfunctional Bundy family, then you'll definitely want to pick up ""Married... with Children: The Complete Fifth Season"" All 25 episodes of the fifth season are presented in 1.33:1 full frame format. The picture quality on these three discs isn't spectacular but still brighter and cleaner than your average television rebroadcast. Its simple 2.0 Dolby Digital sound won't win any awards but gets the job done. Unfortunately, there are no special features in this DVD release. Overall, the 3-disc DVD set is pretty simple but there are enough memorable episodes and hilarious moments to make it worth while.

It's beyond Sony's control and there's nothing anyone can do about it.Besides, this alternate theme began with Columbia Tristar on the Third Season.  Maybe Columbia decided not to continue to release ""Married...with Children"" because they couldn't get Frank Sinatra's ""Love and Marriage"".  What if releasing ""Married..with Children"" just ended right there?  You should thank Sony for choosing to continue releasing ""Married...with Children's"" future seasons episodes.  I appreciate that Sony picked up where Columbia left off.  At least, Sony's got the sense to know that this show is going to continue to sell.  Columbia threw away a great residual profit maker.Anyway, on with Season Five:  I'm sorry to say, that my interest into this show is going to probably end right here.  This season does have some great episodes.  It starts out really strong.  Disc One is my favorite.  Why is that?  Probably because I'm not too fond of the Jefferson D'Arcy character that started on Disc Two.  Steve Rhoades was a money-grubbing stuck-up pig.  Even Marcy shared in the pride of laughing at the poor (and putting down the Bundy's).  But with Steve gone and Jefferson now as Marcy's husband, even Marcy has become a less-interesting character on the show.  Jefferson is a (proudly) spineless, lazy, idiot that you would think Marcy would have no tolerance for.  And these shows written with Jefferson just aren't as interesting as Steve Rhoades made them to be.  And they could have made a more interesting episode on how Marcy met Jefferson.  Waking up suddenly married to a stranger was just too empty of an episode.  Not far-fetched, just too weak.  This truly reinforced how the show was going to start diminishing in appeal for me.So, with Season Six, and the seasons there after, I'll probably just rent them first.

987515,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B000FBH3WM,Taheen Lopez,"[1, 1]","This 1990-91 Season of The Bundy's was hilarious and was the season when I got to like this show and got hooked on it, especially since I never watched MARRIED WITH CHILDREN during it's first 4 seasons on FOX.This is also the season when Jefferson D'Arcy(Ted McGinley) joins the cast and crew of the show in the Winter of 1991 replacing his predecessor Steve Rhoades(David Garrison), except Marcy doesn't even realize she's remarried till she wakes up next to Jefferson, which happens in the second half of the Bundy's 5th Season which also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when I was still living in the Imperial Valley since I was a Senior in high school at Central Union High in El Centro, CA at the time during this 1990-91 Season on Fox when we had all those fiscal budget cuts going on from the recession we had back then when George Bush, Sr. was the president.I also liked seeing knockout Kelly Bundy(Christina Applegate) as the Weenie-Tot girl and the Ellante car commercial where she wears spiffy dresses outclassing all the contestants along with the fact that MARRIED WITH CHILDREN is the show that made Christina Applegate a star, since she wasn't even famous till she got her role as Kelly Bundy, even though Christina Applegate had a guest starring role on FAMILY TIES as Jennifer Keaton's pal(Kitten) when FAMILY TIES was in it's 5th Season and when MARRIED WITH CHILDREN was in it's 1st Season.It was also interesting seeing Matt LeBlanc before his days as Joey Tribbiani on FRIENDS, especially since Matt Le Blanc's guest starring role on the Bundy's was before he was even famous, so it was almost like seeing Kelly Bundy(Christina Applegate) going out with Joey Tribbiani(Matt LeBlanc) in a way, since most people now know Matt LeBlanc from FRIENDS.I also enjoyed seeing Tina Louise from GILLIGANS ISLAND on the Bundy's and watching Ted McGinley becoming a co-star on this show remembering him from his days on HAPPY DAYS and THE LOVE BOAT, despite the fact that I actually liked Steve better than Jefferson, since Steve was much smarter, a lot wiser, a lot more dedicated, a lot more compassionate, and a lot more responsible than Jefferson ever was, despite the fact that Jefferson was kind of a funny doofus.Overall, Married With Children's Fifth Season is a great season and is even better than the first 4 seasons of the Bundy's, so I recommend it to any Bundy fan, although a better title for this show would've been THE BUNDY'S, not MARRIED WITH CHIDREN, since THE BUNDY'S would've fitted the shows title better explaining what the Bundy's are really liked without giving the term ""Married With Children"" a bad name or a false impression for married life with kids in real-life along with the fact that this was the show that made a lot of people want to stay single as well as the show that wanted us to stay childless and the show that many people tried to get cancelled too, due to the fact that MARRIED WITH CHILDREN was crude and a bad influence just like SOUTHPARK and THE FAMILY GUY were.By the way I just got word that Married With Children's 11th Season is now in the works to be released this Fall on Tuesday October 13th, 2009 which I can hardly wait for since the Bundy's 1996-97 Season is their last & final season on top of that.",4,The Bundys
