227070,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,6300247767,Craig Connell,"[1, 1]","This a pretty interesting based-on-a-true life-story of hot-rod racer Shirley Muldowney. Bonnie Bedalia plays the woman who was a pioneer of her sorts, becoming the first female star in thay sport. Whether her life was one big soap opera, I don't know, but the movie concentrates on that sort of thing.Shirley had to fight a lot of obstacles to become the first female star of drag racing. However, the constant arguments with her husband (a very profane Leo Rossi) and then with crew chief-former lover Connie Kallitta (Beau Bridges) wore thin after awhile.**spoiler alert**  One very, very memorable scene in here: Muldowney on fire, stumbling down the racetrack after her car caught on fire. That was horrifying and a scene I've never forgotten, and I first saw this over 20 years ago.
