191286,A37FUJC2L7DSPT,157492463X,"J. L LaRegina ""Jim LaRegina""","[1, 1]","If you earn $50,000.00 a year, you pay $36.82 in taxes toward food stamps annually.  But if you earn nothing, as the widower father of two played by Beau Bridges does in the 1996 television film HIDDEN IN AMERICA, you apply for food stamps.Welfare?  That's $6.36 of your tax dollars every year.Subsidies for Big Oil and other corporate welfare?  $870.00.Yet Bill Januson, portrayed by Bridges in HIDDEN IN AMERICA, beats himself up for being unable to find work that does not even pay nearly as well as the auto plant job he lost.  With the resulting bare cupboard of his home making his daughter sick from malnutrition, Januson sees he is now the kind of man he once viewed as taking handouts so he didn't have to work.  I don't want to blow the story but will say HIDDEN IN AMERICA keeps it real when Januson's son tries to take the bull by the horns, cutting school to scrounge some work at a car repair shop where he learns hard work does not necessarily pay off.And this was the Clinton `90s, when America supposedly was enjoying renewed prosperity.  Well, Big Oil was, especially with its handouts from taxpayers.  As for regular people, when Bill Clinton left the presidency in 2001 minimum wage earners were making 90 cents per hour more than they were when he took office eight years earlier.Beau Bridges is in top form in HIDDEN IN AMERICA among a fine cast including Bruce Davison, who steals every scene in his role as Michael Millerton, a successful physician Januson meets because their daughters are friends.  Januson's the one humbled by the reality of the eroding middle class and a government policy of inadequate response.  But while Millerton does not look down at Januson's situation, it's so foreign to him his embarrassment shows.  Had HIDDEN IN AMERICA been built around Millerton's point of view as the well-off doctor to whom a poor family like the Janusons might have remained invisible if not for their children's friendship, I think it would be that much more memorable.Nonetheless, I won't forget HIDDEN IN AMERICA because what it does well is more than enough despite what it could do better.",4,"If you earn $50 thousand a year, you pay $36.82 toward food stamps",1383955200,"11 9, 2013",2013,2123,"['earn', '50,000.00', 'year', 'pay', '36.82', 'taxes', 'food', 'stamps', 'annually', 'earn', 'nothing', 'widower', 'father', 'two', 'played', 'Beau', 'Bridges', '1996', 'television', 'film', 'HIDDEN', 'IN', 'AMERICA', 'apply', 'food', 'stamps.Welfare', '6.36', 'tax', 'dollars', 'year.Subsidies', 'Big', 'Oil', 'other', 'corporate', 'welfare', '870.00.Yet', 'Bill', 'Januson', 'portrayed', 'Bridges', 'HIDDEN', 'IN', 'AMERICA', 'up', 'being', 'unable', 'find', 'work', 'not', 'even', 'pay', 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'auto', 'plant', 'job', 'lost', 'resulting', 'bare', 'cupboard', 'home', 'making', 'daughter', 'sick', 'malnutrition', 'Januson', 'now', 'kind', 'man', 'once', 'viewed', 'taking', 'handouts', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'blow', 'story', 'will', 'say', 'HIDDEN', 'IN', 'AMERICA', 'real', 'when', 'Januson', 'son', 'take', 'bull', 'horns', 'cutting', 'school', 'scrounge', 'work', 'car', 'repair', 'shop', 'where', 'hard', 'work', 'not', 'necessarily', 'pay', 'off.And', 'was', 'Clinton', '90s', 'when', 'America', 'supposedly', 'was', 'enjoying', 'renewed', 'prosperity', 'Well', 'Big', 'Oil', 'was', 'especially', 'handouts', 'taxpayers', 'regular', 'people', 'when', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'left', 'presidency', '2001', 'minimum', 'wage', 'earners', 'were', 'making', '90', 'cents', 'hour', 'more', 'were', 'when', 'took', 'office', 'eight', 'years', 'earlier.Beau', 'Bridges', 'top', 'form', 'HIDDEN', 'IN', 'AMERICA', 'fine', 'cast', 'including', 'Bruce', 'Davison', 'who', 'scene', 'role', 'Michael', 'Millerton', 'successful', 'physician', 'Januson', 'meets', 'daughters', 'are', 'friends', 'Januson', 'one', 'humbled', 'reality', 'eroding', 'middle', 'class', 'government', 'policy', 'inadequate', 'response', 'Millerton', 'not', 'look', 'down', 'Januson', 'situation', 'so', 'foreign', 'embarrassment', 'shows', 'Had', 'HIDDEN', 'IN', 'AMERICA', 'been', 'built', 'Millerton', 'point', 'view', 'well-off', 'doctor', 'whom', 'poor', 'family', 'Janusons', 'might', 'have', 'remained', 'invisible', 'not', 'children', 'friendship', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'memorable.Nonetheless', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget', 'HIDDEN', 'IN', 'AMERICA', 'what', 'well', 'more', 'enough', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'better']",Hidden in America VHS
191287,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,157492463X,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[10, 10]","I was absolutely stunned the first time I saw this one. DON'T pass up your chance to see this one (or better yet own it) before it fades from the market. Better yet, share it with anyone who believes those mysths about homelessness and poverty in American - that the poor are simply lazy, shiftless, unwilling to work hard and make a go of it. If anything is likely to change their minds, this movie could.  Beau Bridges shines as Bill Januson, a young widower and father who is struggling to make ends meet while caring for his two children. Bridges shows the depth of pain and confusion felt by a man who has never been poor before, who has never been unemployed before and, as a result, is too proud to accept charity, even if he fully deserves a hand up. His 11 year old son decides to take on the role of bread-winner, coming up with an ambitious scheme to raise money, a courageous decision that nearly results in complete tragedy.  But this is a mere bare-bones sketch of a rich, detailed movie. The pace is slow enough to show all the decisions faced by this family every day - the times when a simple meal, clean clothes and a safe, comfortable place to live can't be taken for granted. The pain, despair and self-reliance required to get through each day is portrayed without sentimentality or manipulative drama and the young actor and actress playing the children in this one are superb and keep the movie solidly grounded.

191288,AKS9SJTHTU0OM,157492463X,K. Gordon,"[1, 1]","A moving drama about the under-explored tragedy of hunger among those out of work, or under-employed in modern America - especially how it effects the children of those families.However, unlike Bell's great earlier films ""American Heart"", which explored an ex-con tryingto re-integrate into society, or his documentary `Streetwise' which unblinkingly studied runawayteens in Seattle, this film feels a bit soft, and just a a touch preachy.Of course, this was a TV movie, not a feature, and that could explain the slight lack of edge.  It'sstill bravely dark compared to most American films, but there's never a question of the film'sagenda here.  Of course that's partly due to the difference in subject, but it effects everything;the lighting, the music, even the supporting cast (producer Jeff Bridges appears as a rich doctor,and while he's one of the best American actors of our time, there's something distracting aboutseeing him in a cameo in a film starring his brother, where the two men are treated as unrelatedand never even meet on screen).Beau Bridges does his usual very solid job as the father, likable and human if headstrong andtoo prideful to get the help his family needs.  And generally the acting is all quite good.  I justfelt a little manipulated - to a good cause and a good end mind you - something I never felt inBell's previous work.  In the end, though, the importance of the story, and the strength of theperformances win out, and this is still very much a film worth seeing.",4,"Not quite on the level of Bell's great ""American Heart"" and ""Streetwise"", but well worth seeing",1331683200,"03 14, 2012",2012,1503,"['moving', 'drama', 'under-explored', 'tragedy', 'hunger', 'work', 'under-employed', 'modern', 'America', 'especially', 'how', 'effects', 'children', 'families.However', 'Bell', 'great', 'earlier', 'films', 'American', 'Heart', 'explored', 'ex-con', 'tryingto', 're-integrate', 'society', 'documentary', 'Streetwise', 'unblinkingly', 'studied', 'runawayteens', 'Seattle', 'film', 'bit', 'soft', 'just', 'touch', 'preachy.Of', 'course', 'was', 'TV', 'movie', 'not', 'feature', 'could', 'explain', 'slight', 'lack', 'edge', ""It'sstill"", 'bravely', 'dark', 'compared', 'most', 'American', 'films', 'never', 'question', ""film'sagenda"", 'here', 'course', 'partly', 'due', 'difference', 'subject', 'effects', 'everything', 'lighting', 'music', 'even', 'supporting', 'cast', 'producer', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'rich', 'doctor', 'one', 'best', 'American', 'actors', 'time', 'something', 'distracting', 'aboutseeing', 'cameo', 'film', 'starring', 'brother', 'where', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'treated', 'unrelatedand', 'never', 'even', 'meet', 'screen', '.Beau', 'Bridges', 'usual', 'very', 'solid', 'job', 'father', 'likable', 'human', 'headstrong', 'andtoo', 'prideful', 'get', 'help', 'family', 'needs', 'generally', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'justfelt', 'little', 'manipulated', 'good', 'cause', 'good', 'end', 'mind', 'something', 'never', 'felt', 'inBell', 'previous', 'work', 'end', 'importance', 'story', 'strength', 'theperformances', 'win', 'out', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'film', 'seeing']",Hidden in America VHS
