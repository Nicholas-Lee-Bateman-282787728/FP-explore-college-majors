I thought production values were very good, and the experts hired for interview really knew their subject matter. It was, however, a bit brief on some subjects, particularly Stonehenge, Avebury, Silbury Hill. There was a little info here I had not seen before, however. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I did not have any objection to the CGI of what the structures would originally have looked like.",5,"Good set, more info would be good",1291593600,"12 6, 2010",2010,553,"['could', 'give', '4', '1/2', 'instead', '5', 'probably', 'would', 'would', 'take', 'away', '1/2', 'lack', 'depth', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'take', 'whole', 'star', 'thought', 'production', 'values', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'experts', 'hired', 'interview', 'really', 'knew', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'however', 'bit', 'brief', 'subjects', 'particularly', 'Stonehenge', 'Avebury', 'Silbury', 'Hill', 'was', 'little', 'info', 'here', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'however', 'other', 'reviewers', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'objection', 'CGI', 'what', 'structures', 'would', 'originally', 'have', 'looked']",Lost Worlds

I bought the series based on that review and was pleased I did. If you are a history buff, LOST WORLDS is a must for your DVD collection. I was particularly fascinated by the World War II era stories - HITLER'S SUPERCITY and SECRET CITIES OF THE A-BOMB. Historians take us on a journey of secret and forgotten cities of recent history. Computer images recreate what the cities looked liked. The series is fun, entertaining and visually stunning.

1034814,A1IKPS62K80YS1,B000KJU1GO,J. Fallon,"[8, 11]","First I would like to say that I am a big history channel fan. I own quite a few of their documentaries. This series is one of the worst I own.The titles of the episodes seem exciting at first, but when one finds out the sheer non-fact based history behind most of the episodes, the result is disappointing. I mean honestly; how much can you really know about ""LOST WORLDS"" if there is little evidence to support their existence in the first place?Most of the episodes run the same course. The introduction is given. The ""experts"" then find a tiny piece of circumstantial evidence. The rest of the episode is spent on a wild completely speculated tangeant of non-history based imagination. There is very little fact that goes into most of these documentaries.If you are looking for a history channel documentary series that is truely historical, and is extremely factual I would go with ""Engineering an Empire"" with Peter Weller.The History Channel Presents Engineering an Empire - The Complete Series (Collector's Edition)However my suggestion is to steer clear of this series.

I am a sucker for documentaries about History and I thought this serie would be really really great. The idea behind this serie is very good but sadly the episodes are not very interesting. Sometimes it feels like this show had very little budget, sometimes I felt like I was watching PBS instead of The History Channel ( no disrespect to PBS haha ). Cities of the Underworld is a far better show. It's good, but I was expecting this set to be so much better, a lot more entertaining and interesting. Here is the lineup:* Volume 1: Knights Templar, Jesus' Jerusalem, The First Christians, Palenque* Volume 2: Atlantis, Ramses' Egyptian Empire, Athens - Ancient Supercity* Volume 3: Secret Cities of the A-Bomb, Hitler's Supercity, Churchill's Bunkers* Volume 4: The Real Dracula, Braveheart's Scotland, The Pagans",3,Good but Disappointing,1309392000,"06 30, 2011",2011,860,"['had', 'very', 'high', 'expectations', 'DVD', 'Set', 'am', 'sucker', 'documentaries', 'History', 'thought', 'serie', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'really', 'great', 'idea', 'serie', 'very', 'good', 'sadly', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'show', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'budget', 'sometimes', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'PBS', 'instead', 'History', 'Channel', 'disrespect', 'PBS', 'haha', 'Cities', 'Underworld', 'far', 'better', 'show', 'good', 'was', 'expecting', 'set', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'lot', 'more', 'entertaining', 'interesting', 'Here', 'lineup', '*', 'Volume', '1', 'Knights', 'Templar', 'Jesus', 'Jerusalem', 'First', 'Christians', 'Palenque*', 'Volume', '2', 'Atlantis', 'Ramses', 'Egyptian', 'Empire', 'Athens', 'Ancient', 'Supercity*', 'Volume', '3', 'Secret', 'Cities', 'A-Bomb', 'Hitler', 'Supercity', 'Churchill', 'Bunkers*', 'Volume', '4', 'Real', 'Dracula', 'Braveheart', 'Scotland', 'Pagans']",Lost Worlds
1034817,A1MGGDWRGEVOJ2,B000KJU1GO,"Rhett D. Sorensen ""Old Keen Eye""","[6, 6]","This DVD set was a fantastic buy. The episodes basically take a period of history and recreate it with modern day computer generated graphics and explain the significance of the structures, the events surrounding the structures, and the people involved. The episodes generally consist of the camera crew going to the area being covered and showing what it currently looks like. They throw in the comp generated version if what it used to look like. The archeologists/historians/narrator explain the historical significance of things throughout. There are also some dramatizations, but they are pretty minimal.There is a wide variety of topics that are covered, so chances are you would find at least a few interesting episodes.Some of the episodes include Rameses the II's Egypt, Knight's Templar, Jerusalem, Hitlers under ground bunkers, Greece, Pagan's in the British isles and more. My personal favorites were the 14th century Scotland, the early Christianity episode, and the episode on Vlad Dracula was fantastic.For the price this DVD costs used you really can't go wrong, I highly recommend it.",5,A great DVD set for any history fan,1210550400,"05 12, 2008",2008,1101,"['DVD', 'set', 'was', 'fantastic', 'buy', 'episodes', 'basically', 'take', 'period', 'history', 'recreate', 'modern', 'day', 'computer', 'generated', 'graphics', 'explain', 'significance', 'structures', 'events', 'surrounding', 'structures', 'people', 'involved', 'episodes', 'generally', 'consist', 'camera', 'crew', 'going', 'area', 'being', 'covered', 'showing', 'what', 'currently', 'throw', 'comp', 'generated', 'version', 'what', 'used', 'look', 'archeologists/historians/narrator', 'explain', 'historical', 'significance', 'things', 'are', 'also', 'dramatizations', 'are', 'pretty', 'minimal.There', 'wide', 'variety', 'topics', 'are', 'covered', 'chances', 'are', 'would', 'find', 'least', 'few', 'interesting', 'episodes.Some', 'episodes', 'include', 'II', 'Egypt', 'Knight', 'Templar', 'Jerusalem', 'Hitlers', 'ground', 'bunkers', 'Greece', 'Pagan', 'British', 'isles', 'more', 'personal', 'favorites', 'were', '14th', 'century', 'Scotland', 'early', 'Christianity', 'episode', 'episode', 'Vlad', 'Dracula', 'was', 'fantastic.For', 'price', 'DVD', 'costs', 'used', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'highly', 'recommend']",Lost Worlds
