1160893,A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,B0018RU446,"Alex Honda ""onyx575""","[2, 4]","ELOISE'S RAWTHER UNUSUAL HALLOWEEN is a fun feature film-cartoon starring the 6-year-old princess of NYC's Plaza hotel--Eloise.The movie begins with a legend of ""Diamond Jim Johnson"" whose ghost is said to haunt the Plaza every Halloween. Well the legend comes true and it's up to Eloise and her friends to solve the mystery. Is it a ghost or is it something else that's causing all the strange goings on at the Plaza?Anyway, I'm not familiar with the Eloise stories but this cartoon was fun to watch...although the drawings reminded me of theBeavis and Butt-head - The Mike Judge Collection, Vol. 1cartoons.There are plenty of star voices like Lynn Redgrave, Tim Curry, Brad Garrett and Jim Belushi who bring this story to life.And the DVD provides plenty of ""easter eggs"" (like in the elevator at the main menu you can choose some of the floor numbers for a hidden surprise) and there's a bonus segment called ""plaza pals"" which allows you to find out more about the characters. And there are trailers for other ""Eloise"" DVDs.The kids should love it and it's great to add to the vault for Halloween classics.",4,***FUN***Cartoon For ***HALLOWEEN***,1222646400,"09 29, 2008",2008,1110,"['ELOISE', 'RAWTHER', 'UNUSUAL', 'HALLOWEEN', 'fun', 'feature', 'film-cartoon', 'starring', '6-year-old', 'princess', 'NYC', 'Plaza', 'hotel', 'Eloise.The', 'movie', 'legend', 'Diamond', 'Jim', 'Johnson', 'ghost', 'said', 'haunt', 'Plaza', 'Halloween', 'Well', 'legend', 'true', 'up', 'Eloise', 'friends', 'solve', 'mystery', 'ghost', 'something', 'else', 'causing', 'strange', 'goings', 'Plaza', 'Anyway', ""'m"", 'not', 'familiar', 'Eloise', 'stories', 'cartoon', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'drawings', 'reminded', 'theBeavis', 'Butt-head', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'Collection', 'Vol', '1cartoons.There', 'are', 'plenty', 'star', 'voices', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'Brad', 'Garrett', 'Jim', 'Belushi', 'who', 'bring', 'story', 'life.And', 'DVD', 'plenty', 'easter', 'eggs', 'elevator', 'main', 'menu', 'can', 'choose', 'floor', 'numbers', 'hidden', 'surprise', 'bonus', 'segment', 'called', 'plaza', 'pals', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'characters', 'are', 'trailers', 'other', 'Eloise', 'DVDs.The', 'kids', 'should', 'love', 'great', 'add', 'vault', 'Halloween', 'classics']",Eloise: Rawther Unusual Hallow

In ""Eloise's Rawther Unusual Halloween"",Diamond Jim Johnson, the resident ghost of the Plaza Hotel, returns t haunt the hotel. Eloise sees the ghost, but no one else is inclined to believe her until hotel guests begin to see ghosts themselves. Are the spooks for real or is something else afoot? Eloise, in her signature indomitable and precocious manner, sets out to solve the mystery, providing young viewers with a fun time in the process.The Eloise stories are great fun for young girls, and my little girl has become a fan. Sometimes caution does need to be exercised when viewing this with younger children as Eloise's manner may come across as almost bratty, though she is mostly just verbally and emotionally advanced for her age and very expressive. On the whole, the DVDs are enjoyable and great fun!",5,A fun treat for little girls at Halloween or anytime,1244678400,"06 11, 2009",2009,921,"['4.5', 'year-old', 'only', 'recently', 'started', 'enjoying', 'animated', 'show', 'centered', 'precocious', '6-year-old', 'Eloise', 'Eloise', 'Rawther', 'Unusual', 'Halloween', 'Diamond', 'Jim', 'Johnson', 'resident', 'ghost', 'Plaza', 'Hotel', 't', 'haunt', 'hotel', 'Eloise', 'ghost', 'one', 'else', 'inclined', 'believe', 'hotel', 'guests', 'begin', 'see', 'ghosts', 'Are', 'spooks', 'real', 'something', 'else', 'afoot', 'Eloise', 'signature', 'indomitable', 'precocious', 'manner', 'out', 'solve', 'mystery', 'providing', 'young', 'viewers', 'fun', 'time', 'process.The', 'Eloise', 'stories', 'are', 'great', 'fun', 'young', 'girls', 'little', 'girl', 'become', 'fan', 'caution', 'need', 'be', 'exercised', 'when', 'viewing', 'younger', 'children', 'Eloise', 'manner', 'may', 'come', 'almost', 'bratty', 'mostly', 'just', 'verbally', 'emotionally', 'advanced', 'age', 'very', 'expressive', 'whole', 'DVDs', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'great', 'fun']",Eloise: Rawther Unusual Hallow
