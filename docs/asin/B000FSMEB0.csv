All I can say, is it took me a short time to get used to the characters, but I fell in LOVE with the show! Most evenings watching it I'd be laughing and a few times I'd even cry. This program shows us a simple time in life - unlike today. I really enjoyed all the episodes & I'm sad there are not more seasons out. I don't understand how these programs are this old, and finally getting on DVD? It's seems to be a slow process... but we need MORE HAZEL!!! What you'll find: Love, Laughter, Kindness, Understanding, Morals & Ethics and a message of how to treat people with respect - something we lack today. Once again, the older shows prove to have actual talent. The current TV programs are trash! I'm not even that old, but I can't stand watching TV! So, buy Hazel & other older programs suggested by Amazon - because they will make you feel good after watching them!",5,Hazel is an AMAZING TV Show!,1289779200,"11 15, 2010",2010,1000,"[""'m"", 'buying', 'older', 'programs', 'due', 'lack', 'quality', 'programs', 'TV', 'today', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Hazel', 'bought', '1st', 'season', 'can', 'say', 'took', 'short', 'time', 'get', 'used', 'characters', 'fell', 'LOVE', 'show', 'Most', 'evenings', 'watching', ""'d"", 'be', 'laughing', 'few', 'times', ""'d"", 'even', 'cry', 'program', 'simple', 'time', 'life', 'today', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'episodes', ""'m"", 'sad', 'are', 'not', 'more', 'seasons', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'programs', 'are', 'old', 'finally', 'getting', 'DVD', 'be', 'slow', 'process', 'need', 'MORE', 'HAZEL', 'What', ""'ll"", 'find', 'Love', 'Laughter', 'Kindness', 'Understanding', 'Morals', 'Ethics', 'message', 'how', 'treat', 'people', 'respect', 'something', 'lack', 'today', 'Once', 'again', 'older', 'prove', 'have', 'actual', 'talent', 'current', 'TV', 'programs', 'are', 'trash', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'old', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'watching', 'TV', 'So', 'buy', 'Hazel', 'other', 'older', 'programs', 'suggested', 'Amazon', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'good', 'watching']",N/A

Although too young to remember some of them, I was old enough to remember Hazel.  The show revolves around the adventures of this extraordinary Housekeeper/Maid and her uncanny ability to always make things turn out right.  The family consists of ""Mr. B"" the attorney and head of the family, although if truth be known, I always felt Hazel was the one in charge.  Missy, George's wife, has known Hazel since she was a child and is the perfect complement to her husband.  An interior decorator with excellent taste, she and Hazel have a very loving relationship and Missy can be counted on to run interference when Hazel and Mr. B butt heads.  Then there is the adorable Harold, better known as ""Sport,"" who is such a sweet little boy who worships Hazel and considers her a hero.  The acting is superb and the storylines are anything but sappy. This series proves that wholesome programs have a place in society and with it, there is always a valuable lesson to be learned.  Kudos to Shirley Booth, Don DeFore, Whitney Blake and Bobby Buntrock for delivering a beautiful and entertaining story to the viewers in every episode.

That was what Shirley Booth's ""Come Back, Little Sheba"" co-star Burt Lancaster advised when Ms Booth was approached to star in the sitcom, HAZEL.  We should all be thankful that Booth never took that advice to heart, for without Ms Booth, we most certainly wouldn't have had what has become one of the touchstone comedies of Sixties television.Shirley Booth is Hazel Burke, the housekeeper of the Baxter family.  George Baxter (Don DeFore) is a successful lawyer, his wife ""Missy"" (Whitney Blake) is an interior designer and has known Hazel since childhood.  Their son Harold (Bobby Buntrock) is almost Hazel's own ""surrogate child"" in many ways.  Hazel runs the Baxter house with expert efficiency, though at times her no-nonsense ways cause friction with George.The first season of HAZEL was filmed in crisp black-and-white, with the exception of a special episode (""What'll We Watch Tonight?""), which is in full colour.  Shirley Booth is a sheer joy with her down-to-earth attitude, rallying the Baxters with pep talks, and just making everyday life a little more magical.  I'd love a Hazel in my home!  Ah well, at least we can watch the DVDs!  All 35 episodes from the first season are included here.As is the case with many of their back-catalogue TV releases, Sony has probably given up on releasing additional seasons of HAZEL.  That's a big disappointment for fans, because the show switched to full colour in the second year.  Other ""neglected"" Sony shows have since found more love with independant company Shout!

I will have to admit that I was very young when ""Hazel"" debuted, but I do remember it well.  These earlier episodes on Season One have brought back the memory of the good ""family"" shows of the 1960's.This show ran consistantly good throughout its five year run.  It was mentioned that it went from NBC to CBS in its last year.  I still remember the TV ad promotions the summer before it first aired on CBS.  This last season saw the departure of Don DeFore and Whitney Blake to a foreign country for business.  In the TV spots ""Hazel"" rode on a fire engine into the new neighborhood, and they talked of Hazel ""moving"" to CBS.  Hazel and Harold changed houses to live with George's brother and sister-in-law and family.  The opening credits show a 1965 or 1966 red Mustang (convertible I think) a I've wanted one ever since!""Hazel"" and shows like it were good, decent and dare I say wholesome.  All of these episodes will give you a ""feel good"" feeling.  It's nice to remember simplier days, when all a boy had to worry about is if his dad would let him keep the dog he found.

I do remember watching Hazel in reruns as a younger teen, and even more recently on Superstation WTBS, and TV Land.I was finding that I wasn't really happy with the current offerings of the TV networks.  Then, something finally struck me.  Instead of trying to find new shows that would fit my needs, I looked started to look for old shows.  So, I decided to search Amazon for older TV shows and I rediscovered Hazel.  I bought the first season and I am so glad I did.Hazel is a TV show that is still entertaining, and full of a cast of characters from the full spectrum what TV offers.  There is Mr. Baxter, who is ""the boss of the house"", and his wife Dorothy, who understands Hazel and sides with her position quite often.  And, their son, Harold who adores Hazel.  Mr. Baxter's sister, Deidre, could be described as a snooty, upscale snob who really sets off fireworks in the personality differences that she and Hazel have.  All in all, Hazel has a kind personality, and is liked by everyone.While Hazel admits that she hasn't much real education, and has attended ""hard knocks university"", she is so wise to other people and their needs.  In the Thanksgiving episode, Hazel can immediately tell that Mr. Baxter's widowed mother, played by Harriet E. Mac Gibbon (Mrs. Drysdale of the Beverly Hillbillies)  wanted to help prepare dinner and feel needed again.  In a strong protest, Mr. Baxter didn't want his mother cooking on Thanksgiving.  In an even stronger protest, Hazel quit on the spot, telling Mr. Baxter she needed some help.  Mr. Baxter's mother gladly volunteered and won the right to help Hazel.In this TV show, you will not find violence, sexual overtones, scandal or anything of that nature.

This sitcom was 10 years after the debut of ""I Love Lucy"" and 1 year after Lucy and Desi split up and ended their TV run together. The standard for sitcoms had really changed in 10 years.Audiences were tired of slapstick and non-existent plots. TV watchers wanted something a little more sophisticated but they weren't all as hip suburban or Gotham cool as the Dick Van Dyke show.Hazel fits the bill. Smart and brassy a little sentimental and always entertaining.  It may not be easy for some viewers to tell but Miss Booth had a ball with this character.

The was an extremely popular baby boomer show although it is now in the ""dead man walking"" category as none of the original four principal actors are still alive.George Baxter (Don Defoe who already had a following from his years as Thorny on ""Ozzie and Harriet"") was a successful and wrapped a little too tight attorney who had married a woman (Whitney Blake) with her own lifelong nanny/housekeeper (Shirley Booth in the title role).  They had a young son Harold (Bobby Buntrock).  George is a klutz around the house and most of the conflict revolves around his frustration when he is routinely shown-up by the much more competent Hazel.Hazel pretty much runs the family, sorting out the Baxter's weekly problems and keeping the frustrated blustering George in line.  Living with Hazel was a lot worse than living with Amos McCoy because she was rarely (if ever) wrong or repentant as she incessantly meddled in everyone's life.In its last season the producers shake things up and ship George and Dorothy off to Saudi Arabia.  Hazel and Harold move in with George's younger brother Steve (Ray Fulmer), his wife Barbara (Lynn Borden), and his daughter Susie (Julia Benjamin); 1960's television was notorious for finding creative ways to back fill with younger children when the original ones grew too old to appeal to their intended demographic.Steve, Barbara, and Susie constitute the most physically attractive family in television history, but Hazel soon took over their household as well; although Steve and Barbara do stand up to her better than their predecessors.  The popular theory at the time was than George and Dorothy just made up the Saudi story so they could escape Hazel's domination and live out their lives somewhere else with some degree of independence.Then again, what do I know?

Since most mothers stayed at home anyway, what did they do? Oh well, maybe the housekeepers were there for entertainment value or moral support and Hazel, everybody's favorite, has finally made her way to dvd!Based on the Saturday Evening Post cartoons of Ted Key, Hazel is the highly opinionated and lovable maid to the Baxter family - successful lawyer George Baxter (""Mr. B.""), his wife Dorothy and their son Harold. Hazel keeps the family in line and pretty much runs the household with her no-nonsense and matter-of-fact approach to life.Hazel premiered on NBC in September of 1961 on Thursday nights and ran for five seasons (the final season was shown on CBS). Broadway and film star Shirley Booth (who won an Oscar for ""Come Back Little Sheba"") is the endearment of Hazel and she won 2 Emmys during the series run. This was Booth's first foray into television - however, she was not the first choice for the part. Famous character actress Thelma Ritter was first considered and she wanted the part badly but had to back out due to health problems. Booth made Hazel one of the most memorable characters on television and the show was extremely popular in its day.The first season's shows include: #1 Hazel and the Playground, #2 Hazel Makes a Will, #3  Hazel Plays Nurse, #4 A Matter of Principle, #5 Dorothy's New Client, #6 What'll We Watch Tonight?, #7 A Dog for Harold, #8 George's Niece, #9 Everybody's Thankful But Us Turkeys, #10 Winter Wonderland, #11 Hazel's Winning Personality, #12 Hazel's Christmas Shopping, #13 Dorothy's Obsession, #14 Hazel's Dog Days, #15 Replacement for Phoebe, #16 Hazel's Famous Recipes, #17 Hazel's Tough Customer, #18 Hazel's Secret Wish, #19 Hazel, the Tryst Buster, #20 The Investment Club, #21 Hazel's Mona Lisa Grin, #22 Hazel and the Gardener, #23 Dorothy's Birthday, #24 Number, Please?, #25 Them New Neighbors is Nice, #26 Hazel's Pajama Party, #27 Three Little Cubs, #28  Bringing Out the Johnsons, #29 Hazel Quits, #30 Hazel the Matchmaker, #31 Rock-a-Bye Baby, #32 The Burglar in Mr. B's P.J.'s, #33 Heat Wave, #34 George's Assistant, #35 Hazel's Day",5,Maid to order,1150156800,"06 13, 2006",2006,2211,"['odd', 'most', 'middle-class', 'television', 'families', '1950s', '1960s', 'had', 'housekeepers', 'most', 'mothers', 'stayed', 'home', 'anyway', 'what', 'did', 'do', 'Oh', 'well', 'maybe', 'housekeepers', 'were', 'there', 'entertainment', 'value', 'moral', 'support', 'Hazel', 'everybody', 'favorite', 'finally', 'made', 'way', 'dvd', 'Based', 'Saturday', 'Evening', 'Post', 'cartoons', 'Ted', 'Key', 'Hazel', 'highly', 'opinionated', 'lovable', 'maid', 'Baxter', 'family', 'successful', 'lawyer', 'George', 'Baxter', 'Mr', 'B', 'wife', 'Dorothy', 'son', 'Harold', 'Hazel', 'family', 'line', 'pretty', 'much', 'household', 'no-nonsense', 'matter-of-fact', 'approach', 'life.Hazel', 'premiered', 'NBC', 'September', '1961', 'Thursday', 'nights', 'ran', 'five', 'seasons', 'final', 'season', 'was', 'shown', 'CBS', 'Broadway', 'film', 'star', 'Shirley', 'Booth', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Come', 'Back', 'Little', 'Sheba', 'endearment', 'Hazel', 'won', '2', 'Emmys', 'series', 'run', 'was', 'Booth', 'first', 'foray', 'television', 'however', 'was', 'not', 'first', 'choice', 'part', 'Famous', 'character', 'actress', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'was', 'first', 'considered', 'wanted', 'part', 'badly', 'had', 'back', 'out', 'due', 'health', 'problems', 'Booth', 'made', 'Hazel', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'characters', 'television', 'show', 'was', 'extremely', 'popular', 'day.The', 'first', 'season', 'shows', 'include', '1', 'Hazel', 'Playground', '2', 'Hazel', 'Makes', 'Will', '3', 'Hazel', 'Plays', 'Nurse', '4', 'A', 'Matter', 'Principle', '5', 'Dorothy', 'New', 'Client', '6', 'What', ""'ll"", 'Watch', 'Tonight', '7', 'A', 'Dog', 'Harold', '8', 'George', 'Niece', '9', 'Everybody', 'Thankful', 'Us', 'Turkeys', '10', 'Winter', 'Wonderland', '11', 'Hazel', 'Winning', 'Personality', '12', 'Hazel', 'Christmas', 'Shopping', '13', 'Dorothy', 'Obsession', '14', 'Hazel', 'Dog', 'Days', '15', 'Replacement', 'Phoebe', '16', 'Hazel', 'Famous', 'Recipes', '17', 'Hazel', 'Tough', 'Customer', '18', 'Hazel', 'Secret', 'Wish', '19', 'Hazel', 'Tryst', 'Buster', '20', 'Investment', 'Club', '21', 'Hazel', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Grin', '22', 'Hazel', 'Gardener', '23', 'Dorothy', 'Birthday', '24', 'Number', 'Please', '25', 'Them', 'New', 'Neighbors', 'Nice', '26', 'Hazel', 'Pajama', 'Party', '27', 'Three', 'Little', 'Cubs', '28', 'Bringing', 'Johnsons', '29', 'Hazel', 'Quits', '30', 'Hazel', 'Matchmaker', '31', 'Rock-a-Bye', 'Baby', '32', 'Burglar', 'Mr.', 'B', 'P.J', '33', 'Heat', 'Wave', '34', 'George', 'Assistant', '35', 'Hazel', 'Day']",N/A

First, let me say that the quality of these DVD's is excellent. Now for the bad news--the concept of Hazel hasn't aged well--some aspects of this series are truly weird.  The antics of Shirley Booth's Hazel had me chuckling wildly as an under 5, but I found my now aged self cringing a bit whilst watching it. I won't go into a long analysis here, but would direct all potential purchasers to an episode entitled Hazel's Pajama Party.

The show is completely carried by Shirley Booth, who can go from being funny, to endearing, to exasperating with the greatest of ease.

Whitney Blake plays the charming wife, Mrs. Baxter (Missy), who Hazel has known since she was a child.  She's one of the most attractive TV actresses ever, I think, and invariably is a supporter of Hazel.  Bobby Buntrock plays the obligatory cute son, Harold.

There's a comfort to it, like coming home from school and knowing there will be milk and fresh-baked cookies (preferably baked by Hazel)!  It's also sweet, funny and often sentimental.There are several episodes, in fact, that made me tear up at the end.  That's, in no small part, a credit to Shirley Booth who gives the character so much dimension.  She could have easily portrayed the role only as a busybody maid.  But Hazel isn't just a maid; she is one of the family.  I've always seen her as more of the grandmother role than that of someone who works for the Baxters.It's a wonderful cast:  Don DeFore as George Baxter, Whitney Blake as Dorothy ""Missy"" Baxter and Bobby Buntrock as Harold.  There are also some great recurring characters who make up their neighborhood:  The extremely charming but inept Mr. and Mrs. Johnson, friends of Hazel's including: the postman, milkman and other maids and George's sister and his client Mr. Griffin.Season one (1961/62) has 35 episodes.

I thought it would be nice to see a comedy that I didn't know every episode, and 35 episodes for this price seemed pretty good.I was hoping I would enjoy it, but I really was surprised at how much!The show is very funny, with great dialogue and character driven gags. For me, the key to the show is Hazel and Mr. B's (George Baxter) ongoing battles of who knows best.  Although humorously blunt comments, and funny barbs get thrown about, the show does a tremendous job of showing their mutual admiration and care for each other. The show always has a warm hearted feeling which is the lynch-pin.Mr. B is typically on the short end of the stick (or bet), but he is not made out as a buffoon.  Mrs. Baxter and Harold are both good, but don't have quite as much to do.  Mrs. B(Missy to Hazel -who has cared for her since she was 8), does interior decorating, and is no dummy. She is, of course, beautiful. Harold can be pretty funny and is never annoying.  An obnoxious child actor can easily spoil a show.The show is in B&W;, except for the episode in which Hazel buys a color TV.  Apparently filmed in color as a promotional stunt for that one episode.  No stunting the story though, Hazel was just as funny in color.I liked the shows continuity also.  If the kid gets a dog, he has the same dog from then on.  If a neighbor or relative shows up in an episode, they usually reappear in a later episode.  OK, Mr. B's injured hand skips around a bit.  Had me curious how he really broke it.My favorite scene stealers are the Johnsons next door.  An elderly couple so sheltered by their privileged upbringings that they have never learned to operate the simplest household appliance.  Naturally they always seem to be left without staff, so Hazel must come to their rescue.  The joy they express at solving the complex puzzle of getting the TV plugged in is too much!Like most shows around that time, there is a complete lack of diversity on the show, but recognizing the era, I will take issues ignored over poorly portrayed stereotypes that make me cringe. Especially when I'm looking for a little escapism in place of the news.For the reviewer who complained of the slumber party episode, come on!  It is totally explained why Hazel wants to be a part of the kid's party.  She loves kids, and lost her parents at a young age, so missed her own childhood.  That episode really drove home that she is part of the family, and how much she is loved by the Baxters.There is nothing but laughs and good feelings to be had from this show. My wife started watching with me, then went back to catch the ones she missed.  My mother in-law and sister both have gotten hooked, and gush about the show too.  It is a cozy, satisfying, and hilarious show.

995578,A315WMPERH1S0Z,B000FSMEB0,Tee,"[62, 64]","I don't think I'd seen a HAZEL episode since the early 1970's when I was ten or so before buying this DVD set.  I had always enjoyed the show, mainly because of the superb actress Shirley Booth, who was always good and appealing in everything she ever did. What surprised me is how genuinely funny HAZEL was! I was expecting something along the lines of a gentle little drama masquerading as a sitcom ala FATHER KNOWS BEST, OZZIE AND HARRIET, DONNA REED, and other ""family comedies"" shows of the period.  HAZEL, however, is full of hilarious comments and situations - there's not an episode on this DVD that didn't make me laugh!Miss Booth stars as an irrepressible maid who is not only a full member of the household she is employed with but something of the grande dame (emphasis on dame) of the neighborhood - often pitching in and working in neighbor's homes!! Hazel knows everybody and everybody knows Hazel.  Greeting everyone with an earthy charm (and often a plate of food), Hazel  never met a situation she didn't take a personal interest in and try to fix - occasionally with temporarily diasterious results.  It's hard to think of another actress who could pull off this surprisingly complex role, certainly not the wonderful Thelma Ritter whom reportedly was the first choice.  Ritter would have been in keeping with the caustic Hazel of the single panel SATURDAY EVENING POST cartoons but she could have never played this television Hazel, who is warm, empathic, and generous and whose wisecracks are never malicious barbs (when Hazel makes a remark about her boss' expanding waistline it's out of concern, not a fat joke).  Shirley Booth's Hazel is the beloved middle-aged lady who seems not to understand when to back off, but whose intentions are so good you always forgive her and whose common sense is so strong more often than not she's on the money.The whole cast is wonderful - incredibly beautiful Whitney Blake (a Kim Novak lookalike) as ""Missy"", whom Hazel has cared for since childhood, Don DeFore as Blake's husband, George Baxter, who at times resents Hazel's ""helping"" hand, and little Bobby Buntrock as their son Harold.  Also of note in semi-regular roles are character actresses Maudie Prickett (as Hazel's best friend, neighborhood maid Rosie) and Norma Varden (as the elderly, affluent next-door-neighbor utterly incapable of doing anything for herself).Yes, HAZEL evokes a happier era when life was more comfortable and less complicated for many (minorities and people of less affluence might disagree) but still this was almost half a century ago and the world does move on, sometimes for the better but not always.  It's a bit bittersweet to me watching this program and knowing all the major cast have now gone on like the very era itself but the warm humor and vivid friendliness of this wonderful program makes revisiting the world of the Baxters a very delightful experience.

995584,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000FSMEB0,trebe,"[2, 2]","A multiple Tony Award winner, and Academy Award winning actress for her role in Come Back, Little Sheba (1952), Shirley Booth came to television, starring as Hazel Burke, the loyal and loving live-in maid for the Baxter family.  Hazel is part of the family, and in her own unique way, she manages the household, and manipulates much of what happens under the roof of the Baxter residence.  Domestic life is something that most people can relate to, and audiences at the time loved Hazel, making it a top five hit in its debut season.  Ms. Booth's powerful and winning performance in the role, earned her three nominations, and two Emmy wins as best actress in comedy, in the program's first three years on the air.A near tireless worker, and a terrific cook, Hazel's mind is like a computer, able to keep track of what everyone else in the family is doing and what they need.  She is always concerned about others, and tries to help, even when it may be none of her business.  Her forwardness and occasional lack of tack in speaking her mind, is offensive to some, but her good intentions usually help to smooth things over.  A master at manipulation, psychology, and human nature, Hazel is well aware of the influence and power she has within the Baxter family and her circle of friends.  She wisely, also knows her limits as well, mostly...George Baxter (Don DeFore) is a lawyer who `inherited' Hazel when he married his wife Dorothy (Whitney Blake), as Hazel had been a `domestic engineer' for Dorothy's family since she was a girl.  Harold (Bobby Buntrock) is the Baxter's young son.  Hazel has pet names for each of the family members, `Mister B' for George, `Missy' for Dorothy, and `Sport' for Harold.  The heart of the program usually revolves around the struggle between George and Hazel, over various family related or household matters.  It may not sound very exciting, but just about anyone that has experienced suburban life, can relate to the family dynamics and situations that arise in the program.  Mr. B is usually set on doing things his way, for reasons that make perfect sense to him, but he realizes that the odds are often stacked against him, as he is usually contending with both Hazel and his wife, pulling his strings.  The two are very close, with Hazel having been a confidant of Dorothy's for years.Adapted from a comic strip by Ted Key, Hazel is a slice of American suburban life that clearly resonated with the public at the time.  It's the kind of innocent squeaky clean programming that has long since faded into the past.  Shirley Booth is magnificent as Hazel, the domestic powerhouse.  It takes a special guy to play George Baxter, a good man constantly being upstaged and manipulated, and Don DeFore does it superbly.  As Dorothy, Whitney Blake is always cheerful, and supportive of everyone.  And Bobby Buntrock shines when he is given the opportunity.The series is well-written, and features a nice variety of situations and characters that keeps things interesting.  For a program from 1961, the image quality of the black and white episodes is outstanding.  There are 35 episodes on four single sided discs.  The episodes have chapter stops, but no subtitles, and unfortunately there are no bonus materials.  After a long gap, season two is rumored to be scheduled for release sometime in 2011.Full of sage wisdom, but a little rough around the edges, and something of a buttinski, Hazel Burke is a tireless benevolent force, that few can contend with.  For good clean wholesome fun, that may have you wondering if life was ever really that uncomplicated, you can't go wrong with Hazel.  If you have a heart, you will laugh, and you will cry, as you follow the everyday lives of the Baxters.",5,"the fun times around the Baxter house, will surely touch your heart...",1307232000,"06 5, 2011",2011,3733,"['multiple', 'Tony', 'Award', 'winner', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'actress', 'role', 'Come', 'Back', 'Little', 'Sheba', '1952', 'Shirley', 'Booth', 'came', 'television', 'starring', 'Hazel', 'Burke', 'loyal', 'loving', 'live-in', 'maid', 'Baxter', 'family', 'Hazel', 'part', 'family', 'own', 'unique', 'way', 'household', 'much', 'what', 'roof', 'Baxter', 'residence', 'Domestic', 'life', 'something', 'most', 'people', 'can', 'relate', 'audiences', 'time', 'loved', 'Hazel', 'making', 'top', 'five', 'hit', 'debut', 'season', 'Ms.', 'Booth', 'powerful', 'winning', 'performance', 'role', 'earned', 'three', 'nominations', 'two', 'Emmy', 'wins', 'best', 'actress', 'comedy', 'program', 'first', 'three', 'years', 'air.A', 'tireless', 'worker', 'terrific', 'cook', 'Hazel', 'mind', 'computer', 'able', 'keep', 'track', 'what', 'everyone', 'else', 'family', 'doing', 'what', 'need', 'always', 'concerned', 'others', 'tries', 'help', 'even', 'when', 'may', 'be', 'none', 'business', 'forwardness', 'occasional', 'lack', 'tack', 'speaking', 'mind', 'offensive', 'good', 'intentions', 'usually', 'help', 'smooth', 'things', 'master', 'manipulation', 'psychology', 'human', 'nature', 'Hazel', 'well', 'aware', 'influence', 'power', 'Baxter', 'family', 'circle', 'friends', 'wisely', 'also', 'limits', 'as', 'well', 'mostly', 'George', 'Baxter', 'Don', 'DeFore', 'lawyer', 'who', 'inherited', 'Hazel', 'when', 'married', 'wife', 'Dorothy', 'Whitney', 'Blake', 'Hazel', 'had', 'been', 'domestic', 'engineer', 'Dorothy', 'family', 'was', 'girl', 'Harold', 'Bobby', 'Buntrock', 'Baxter', 'young', 'son', 'Hazel', 'pet', 'names', 'family', 'members', 'Mister', 'B', 'George', 'Missy', 'Dorothy', 'Sport', 'Harold', 'heart', 'program', 'usually', 'struggle', 'George', 'Hazel', 'various', 'family', 'related', 'household', 'matters', 'may', 'not', 'sound', 'very', 'exciting', 'just', 'anyone', 'experienced', 'suburban', 'life', 'can', 'relate', 'family', 'dynamics', 'situations', 'arise', 'program', 'Mr.', 'B', 'usually', 'set', 'doing', 'things', 'way', 'reasons', 'make', 'perfect', 'sense', 'odds', 'are', 'often', 'stacked', 'usually', 'contending', 'Hazel', 'wife', 'pulling', 'strings', 'two', 'are', 'very', 'close', 'Hazel', 'having', 'been', 'confidant', 'Dorothy', 'years.Adapted', 'comic', 'strip', 'Ted', 'Key', 'Hazel', 'slice', 'American', 'suburban', 'life', 'clearly', 'resonated', 'public', 'time', 'kind', 'innocent', 'squeaky', 'clean', 'programming', 'long', 'faded', 'past', 'Shirley', 'Booth', 'magnificent', 'Hazel', 'domestic', 'powerhouse', 'special', 'guy', 'play', 'George', 'Baxter', 'good', 'man', 'constantly', 'being', 'upstaged', 'manipulated', 'Don', 'DeFore', 'superbly', 'Dorothy', 'Whitney', 'Blake', 'always', 'cheerful', 'supportive', 'everyone', 'Bobby', 'Buntrock', 'shines', 'when', 'given', 'opportunity.The', 'series', 'well-written', 'nice', 'variety', 'situations', 'characters', 'keeps', 'things', 'interesting', 'program', '1961', 'image', 'quality', 'black', 'white', 'episodes', 'outstanding', 'are', '35', 'episodes', 'four', 'single', 'sided', 'discs', 'episodes', 'have', 'chapter', 'stops', 'subtitles', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'bonus', 'materials', 'long', 'gap', 'season', 'two', 'rumored', 'be', 'scheduled', 'release', 'sometime', '2011.Full', 'sage', 'wisdom', 'little', 'rough', 'edges', 'something', 'buttinski', 'Hazel', 'Burke', 'tireless', 'benevolent', 'force', 'few', 'can', 'contend', 'good', 'clean', 'wholesome', 'fun', 'may', 'have', 'wondering', 'life', 'was', 'ever', 'really', 'uncomplicated', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'Hazel', 'have', 'heart', 'will', 'laugh', 'will', 'cry', 'follow', 'everyday', 'lives', 'Baxters']",N/A
