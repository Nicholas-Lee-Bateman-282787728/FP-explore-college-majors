There's one scene in particular where the girl is essentially raped, and, the way the film progresses thenceforth, it is as if we are supposed to accept this offensive assault as an acceptable part of their relationship.I personally agree with rattlesnakes that this part of the scene not only presents raping but also shows that women are treated as cheaps like been treated as a horker or so called prostitutes. I feel that this is an objectional scene which I think should be carefully reviewed for some rights to women. I think there is no respect to women in this part of the scene. Beside this scene, I think the rest are normal between couples.

411525,A3TY54T5QG26ID,6304286384,erdprod,"[1, 1]","Jean-Jacques Annaud is one of the greatest directors around.  Once you get past Jane March naked (and she is very naked in this film) and you look at her eyes and mouth you see what a great director can do with absolutely NO DIALOG.  Tony Leung and her speak without talking throughout this movie.  They speak with eyes and hands and fingers and lips.  Annaud takes the flash back to its limits with the opening.  He speaks with eyes, hands, fingers and even water going into the river.  His is one big controlled visual and audio feat where even hair is used to convey emotion.

It is so unusual that a cinemagraphic expression lives up to a great work of literature, but Jean-Jacques Annaud gives us the visual rendition of Marguerite Duras' prize winning novel.  Annaud captures the poetry and passion of Duras' 1930's Indochina.  It is simply a captivating movie to watch.  I've seen this movie three times before, but always the Blockbuster ""R"" version.  The sex scenes in the unrated DVD version of the film are simply breathtaking.  Contrary to another viewer, below, I find that art and expression of the film is accomplished through the love scenes.  After all, the story examines mystery, desire, and forbidden love.  The lovers are different, they are more, they are exuberantly liberated when they are together.  The love scenes provide the necessary counterpoint to the banality of their lives apart.  Their vigorous sexuality underscores the paradox of the rich, and worldly Chinese man who offers himself up to humiliation and abuse from French colonial white-trash, all for the sake of a young girl.  Their relationship is viseral and mysterious.  Their lovemaking and common language mask yet personify their embodiment of the mutual identities as part of the French and Chinese as colonizers of Vietnam.  L'Amant breaks new boundaries as an exploration of forbidden love, anticolonialism, and the suffering people endure because they resign themselves to living their own lies.  L'Amant is a beautiful film, brilliantly acted, that says so much by saying so little.  The film score by Gabriel Yared is also breathtaking.  Cinema doesn't get any better than this.

The film manages to capture the quality of Duras' prose through brilliant cinematography that is at times both delicate and brutal. Watching the leads cavort in the man's dark, musty bedroom lit only by the cracks in window blinds is quite a treat, if one is inclined to enjoy such pursuits. Tony Leung and Jane March are sufficiently beautiful to hold interest, but not enough for the inordinate amount of screen time they are given solely indulging in the pleasures of Venus. The girl's outside relationships, particularly those with her mother and younger brother, are relegated to the background to the movie's detriment. Marguerite Duras' novel is a delicate balance of eroticism and family dissent, and the film would have rated 5 stars had it achieved the same balance. But ""The Lover"" is saved by glorious cinematography and the charisma of Jane March, who has a heartbreakingly gorgeous final scene.The affected simplicity of emotion also grazed through this film. For example the swirling reflection of tropical plants on the hood of the car, Tony Leung and Jane March discovering each other's feeling by the touch of there hands, or a scene of two women observing one another as their cars pass's each other. Scenes such as these show sheer sumptuousness and natural subtlety of the highest caliber.

Whover categorized this movie as soft porn needs to wash his or her mind out with Lysol.  It is, quite simply, a love story.Jane March plays ""the young girl"", a French adolescent in colonial Vietnam living with her widowed mother and two brothers.  Her mother barely makes ends meet by teaching, her younger brother, with whom she has a relationship both protective and erotic, is weak and passive, and her older brother is brutally antisocial, stealing the family's few funds to support his opium habit and bullying his younger siblings through violence.The girl attends a lyc&eacute;e in Saigon where she and her friend are the only Caucasian pupils.  On a trip from her home back to school she meets ""the Chinaman"" played by Tony Leung, and their encounter sets off sparks.  Leung is the son of a rich overseas Chinese, engaged to marry the Chinese girl picked out by his father, who spends his own days in an opium haze; his feelings for the young girl are at first purely sexual but ripen into a love so deep it confuses and frightens him.It's a love that is doomed from the start.  His father will not hear of him marrying a non-Chinese, and her family, although the equivalent of white trash, still considers themselves better than the Asians they live among.  When the word of her affair with the Chinaman gets out, she becomes an outcast among her schoolmates.  The young girl tries to cope with the social and emotional conflicts by convincing herself and telling him that she doesn't love him; he knows she's kidding herself and so do we, and toward the movie's end, when she has lost him forever through his marriage to the woman chosen for him by his father and her own repatriation to France, she can't hide from herself the fact that she is deeply in love with him.Jane March is incredible in the role of the young girl; she brings out all her character's innocence, sexuality and adolescent confusion.  Tony Leung is just right as the pampered son of a rich family who is hamstrung by the mores and traditions of his family and society; and Frederique Meininger is especially effective as the mother, who dotes on her worthless older son (the more venal she knows he is, the more she dotes on him, helpless to deal with the reality of what he is, and worse, what he will become), and condemns her daughter's relationship with a Chinese on the one hand while she has no problem taking her daughter's lover's money on the other.  The cinematography is beautiful and conveys all the heat and languor of colonial Vietnam.This is no film for children; the sex scenes are as explicit as can be shown in any film not rated X.  At the film's end (Jeanne Moreau does an excellent voice-over throughout the movie), when the Chinaman after decades of silence telephones the girl who is now a middle-aged woman and tells her he has never forgotten her and will love her until death, we realize how strong was the love between these two.  It's a beautiful film of two people who were just right, even while they were all wrong, for each other.Judy Lind",5,"A sensuous, erotic and touching love story",1010361600,"01 7, 2002",2002,3171,"['Lover', 'gorgeously', 'sensuous', 'erotic', 'film', 'young', 'girl', 'awakening', 'love', 'own', 'sexuality', 'categorized', 'movie', 'soft', 'porn', 'needs', 'wash', 'mind', 'Lysol', 'quite', 'simply', 'love', 'story.Jane', 'March', 'young', 'girl', 'French', 'adolescent', 'colonial', 'Vietnam', 'living', 'widowed', 'mother', 'two', 'brothers', 'mother', 'barely', 'ends', 'meet', 'teaching', 'younger', 'brother', 'whom', 'relationship', 'protective', 'erotic', 'weak', 'passive', 'older', 'brother', 'brutally', 'antisocial', 'stealing', 'family', 'few', 'funds', 'support', 'opium', 'habit', 'bullying', 'younger', 'siblings', 'violence.The', 'girl', 'lyc', 'eacute', 'Saigon', 'where', 'friend', 'are', 'only', 'Caucasian', 'pupils', 'trip', 'home', 'back', 'school', 'Chinaman', 'played', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'encounter', 'sets', 'off', 'sparks', 'Leung', 'son', 'rich', 'overseas', 'Chinese', 'engaged', 'marry', 'Chinese', 'girl', 'picked', 'out', 'father', 'who', 'own', 'days', 'opium', 'haze', 'feelings', 'young', 'girl', 'are', 'first', 'purely', 'sexual', 'ripen', 'love', 'so', 'deep', 'him.It', 'love', 'doomed', 'start', 'father', 'will', 'not', 'hear', 'marrying', 'non-Chinese', 'family', 'equivalent', 'white', 'trash', 'still', 'better', 'Asians', 'live', 'When', 'word', 'affair', 'Chinaman', 'out', 'outcast', 'schoolmates', 'young', 'girl', 'tries', 'cope', 'social', 'emotional', 'conflicts', 'convincing', 'telling', ""n't"", 'love', 'kidding', 'so', 'do', 'movie', 'end', 'when', 'lost', 'forever', 'marriage', 'woman', 'chosen', 'father', 'own', 'repatriation', 'France', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hide', 'fact', 'deeply', 'love', 'him.Jane', 'March', 'incredible', 'role', 'young', 'girl', 'out', 'character', 'innocence', 'sexuality', 'adolescent', 'confusion', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'just', 'right', 'pampered', 'son', 'rich', 'family', 'who', 'hamstrung', 'mores', 'traditions', 'family', 'society', 'Frederique', 'Meininger', 'especially', 'effective', 'mother', 'who', 'worthless', 'older', 'son', 'more', 'venal', 'more', 'helpless', 'deal', 'reality', 'what', 'worse', 'what', 'will', 'become', 'daughter', 'relationship', 'Chinese', 'one', 'hand', 'problem', 'taking', 'daughter', 'lover', 'money', 'other', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'conveys', 'heat', 'languor', 'colonial', 'Vietnam.This', 'film', 'children', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'as', 'explicit', 'can', 'be', 'shown', 'film', 'not', 'rated', 'X', 'film', 'end', 'Jeanne', 'Moreau', 'excellent', 'voice-over', 'movie', 'when', 'Chinaman', 'decades', 'silence', 'telephones', 'girl', 'who', 'now', 'middle-aged', 'woman', 'never', 'forgotten', 'will', 'love', 'death', 'realize', 'how', 'strong', 'was', 'love', 'two', 'beautiful', 'film', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'just', 'right', 'even', 'were', 'wrong', 'other.Judy', 'Lind']",The Lover VHS

The director, Jean-Jaques Annaud, is fantastic and the casting is top notch.It has that lolita kinda feel because of the age difference between the two lovers, with a bit more sympathy for the characters. Both leads are very attractive and it sells their lust at first site kind of scenario.It is French Colonial Vietnam in 1929. Their relationship feels doomed. Cultural restraints and plain bullheadness strive to keep them apart. The girl's family is provincial and disfunctional at their best. The chinese man has only his, traditional,chinese,upperclass, opium addict, father who is very distant but not so didtant as to le thim date a poor french girl.Since they can't be together openly, they end up having a semi-secret affair. At this point their sex becomes the main character for awhile. There is alot of pathos in the sex. The sex is the story in alot of ways but its not smutty or dirty, just intense. the relationship devolves from there.I won't give away anymore but yeah i think its worth buying. The director is very respectful to the actors and the entire movie is well shot and well acted.The DVD is nothing special feature wise. It's the movie slapped on a disc. Quality is fine, no supplemental features.

I was so awestruck by this film THE LOVER that I really pondered it before writing.Simply put, THE LOVER is an absolutely stunning and shockingly evocative piece of cinematic art.I knew NOTHING about this film before watching it, so I was totally taken by surprise by the depths of sexuality and passion that this film plummets.It is hard to express it otherwise.The film is dumbfounding in it's subject matter,acting,story,cinematography and soundtrack.This is what I like to call an ""all-around film"".....every note rings true!Told from a detached point of view, THE LOVER concerns the 18-year-old ""the girl""(Jane March) in 1929 Indochina (French Colonial Vietnam),and her relationship with the 32-year-old ""the Chinaman""(Tony Leung).She is awakening sexually and he is obsessed with her.The very intense relationship progresses as each plays with each other's bodies, lives and feelings.He says that he is in a prearranged marriage and cannot marry her.But he seems totally taken with her.She says that sex is totally fine with her, but could she be denying that it is love that she feels? With both families aware and opposed to their meeting,""the girl"" and ""the Chinaman"" continue on exploring each other. It is only at the end that the true feelings are revealed. This may sound to some rather dull and boring, but trust me it is not! This is as sensitive as it is steamy,and will leave you breathless.This film has explicit sex scenes (very explicit),but they are so artfully done that one is not shocked,but rather is drawn into the experience that these two souls are having.I have never seen anything like it. If you are the slightest bit of a prude...well....you lose!This is a riveting  and rare piece of film.You will not easily forget this one.Excellent companion films would be INDOCHINE,THE QUIET AMERICAN, SOLOMON AND GAENOR, LOLITA and AN AFFAIR OF LOVE (Une Liaison Pornographique).",5,SEXUAL AND STEAMY!!!For him was it love or obsession ?

If anything, his station in Chinese royalty probably provided him with female companionship until (and perhaps after) his arranged marriage.Through no effort on his part the schoolgirl appeared in his orbit and he found himself unable to look away.  This is a rare thing to experience and it is awfully hard to resist.If we generally only see Leung and March having sex, we need to factor in that her jailbait status and the inter-racial nature of their relationship would not have allowed them to carry on a normal courtship.  The sex was just about all that was left to them (and the director).It was tragic not to see these two end up together, but there was a redeeming event at the end of this movie that made it worth my while.In his old age Leung wrote to March that he would ""love her until death"".  Society dictates that when two people part ways they must let each other go and move on.  Rarely do we give or receive the assurance of on-going love in a situation like this.  If both are in agreement that the relationship should not continue, this is a rare, beautiful, and appropriate gem to store away in one's heart.",4,Love Until Death,1225756800,"11 4, 2008",2008,1380,"['Please', 'note', 'will', 'be', 'giving', 'plot', 'anyone', 'who', 'film', 'underage', 'sex', 'porn', 'are', 'subtleties', 'need', 'be', 'explored.There', 'reason', 'believe', 'Chinaman', 'sought', 'out', 'underage', 'girls', 'anything', 'station', 'Chinese', 'royalty', 'probably', 'provided', 'female', 'companionship', 'perhaps', 'arranged', 'effort', 'part', 'schoolgirl', 'appeared', 'orbit', 'found', 'unable', 'look', 'away', 'rare', 'thing', 'experience', 'awfully', 'hard', 'resist.If', 'generally', 'only', 'see', 'Leung', 'March', 'having', 'sex', 'need', 'factor', 'jailbait', 'status', 'inter-racial', 'nature', 'relationship', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'allowed', 'carry', 'normal', 'courtship', 'sex', 'was', 'just', 'was', 'left', 'director', '.It', 'was', 'tragic', 'not', 'see', 'two', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'there', 'was', 'redeeming', 'event', 'end', 'movie', 'made', 'worth', 'while.In', 'old', 'age', 'Leung', 'wrote', 'March', 'would', 'love', 'death', 'Society', 'when', 'two', 'people', 'part', 'ways', 'must', 'let', 'other', 'go', 'move', 'Rarely', 'do', 'give', 'receive', 'assurance', 'on-going', 'love', 'situation', 'are', 'agreement', 'relationship', 'should', 'not', 'continue', 'rare', 'beautiful', 'appropriate', 'gem', 'store', 'away', 'one', 'heart']",The Lover VHS

Now, it's obvious to me that anytime the title,""THE LOVER"" is heard, I glow from the inside. That happened to me the first time I seen it on ON DEMAND. It was a windy night too. A fit night for a Sensuous, Breathtaking, Pulse pounding,and deeply intimate movie. I knew right then and there that I had to write about it. The remake of ""Lolita"" is my favorite, now ""The Lover"" is my 2nd best favorite movie around. This movie was everything I predicted. Once-young Actress Jane March had her character down to a key, being a girl who has a mother for a school teacher, a older brother for a jerk, a little brother who's shy and kind to everyone and has wandering eyes for the fortunate life. She meets Tony Leung's character ""The Chinaman"" and that's when love starts to bloom. When he touched her hand, while they were riding, she never felt nervous, she dosed off in the black car. I had the feeling that she didn't mind the Chinaman being attracted to her. And I guess he didn't mind her being sleepy at all. She kept this all on the Down-Low,She never told anybody, not even her friend at the camp. When the attraction came to the bedroom, nothing around them ever mattered. He was afraid and shy, but she trusted him. He worried that he'd be throwned in jail for Stachitory Rape, but she assured him that it'll be okay. She made her move, he made his, and everything else came with it. What really made me glow is that they didn't stop seeing each other, when he got married to some other woman,that's when the STEAMY affair ended. I had no issue with this movie because it was harmless. She loved him, he loved her and that was all that mattered to them. Age was indeed out of the question. So, this is why I give it 2 thumbs up, an A+,5 stars and everyting else that's in the book.

As required reading for upper division coursework at the University of the Pacific, I was introduced to several outstanding novels that have been made into excellent thought and soul provoking movies. This movie was one of them. I am particularly UNinterested in ""love stories"", ""romance"" or ""erotica"" per se, but this movie has original, cultural and sensual nuances that CANNOT be denied with such viewing pleasure.There is a deeper wisdom than projected on the surface of this movie.

The plot is very well-developed, orginal, and not to mention risky- a young girl with an older man in an interracial relationship in the 1920's.  This is a deep look at a young girl's coming of age and early sexuality.  It is her first look at adult life, and is a good escape from her &quot;white trash&quot; family, poor surroundings, and boarding school where she is one of only two white students.  The older man becomes not only her lover but her escape.  Her character can be dislikable because she is always brutally honest; however, she is true to herself and honestly does not know if she loves the man or if she is confusing love with power, acceptance, sexual awakening, access to money, or anything else.  The man insists the whole time that he loves her and seems sincere, although there is one part where he says that the only white women he could ever get were prostitutes, so he could have an ulterior motive of being with a willing white partner.  In any case, this movie is a unique and sincere portrait of two very different people, both alienated in the world they live in, both aching for love, sex, and something different in their respective lives.

411565,A2K3UTNW0783U6,6304286384,Phillip Kay,"[18, 20]","Jean-Jacques Annaud (Two Brothers, Enemy at the Gate) made L'Amant (The Lover) in 1992. He wrote the script, but the story is from an autobiographical novel by Marguerite Duras. Anyone who has heard the narrator from Hiroshima Mon Amour, the film Duras scripted for Alain Resnais, will know what to expect from the book, and from the film as well, for Annaud is faithful to it. Duras writes some of the most beautiful, most precise prose of any modern writer, and preserves a tone of ironic detachment that draws the reader deep into the emotional process she is describing.Annaud takes a risk in following the book so closely, for his film becomes literary rather than cinematic, and viewers sometimes find it empty, lacking in the kind of melodramatic intensity we've become used to in movies. In a reference to Hiroshima Mon Amour perhaps, Annaud has two parallel narrative streams throughout the movie, and this device succeeds in making it a great movie.Viewers, especially in puritan America, are taken aback at the intensely erotic lovemaking scenes, which comprise most of the visual content of the movie. The lovmaking is so real that one wonders if the actors were really doing it, and not acting at all (I think they were). Other components may be dwarfed by this content, but they are there: the magnificent photography of landscape and city which expresses the love the characters have for their home; the racial divide between Asian and European; and the overriding theme of growing up.The second narrative stream is the reflections of the elderly Duras (spoken by Jeanne Moreau in a non acting but important role) as she comments on the actions of her younger self as they are depicted in the film. This is the essence of both book and film. The tender, nostalgic tone of the elder Duras discovers both innocence and ignorance in the younger one; this is an experience everyone (except the very young) can relate to. The grandiose, empty generalisations (all women are prostitutes, the young girl tells her friend: I wouldn't mind being one). The eagerness for sexual experience, for losing one's virginity and becoming 'adult'. Focusing on one's own overwhelming reactions and cultivating a kind of blindness to the reactions of others. It is by looking back that Duras discovers the depth of the passion she has inspired in her lover. It is by looking back that she also discovers her feelings, on the surface so self confidently detached, were deeper than she realised. The lover loved her all his life. L'Amant is a love letter both to him, the lover, and her younger self, an attempt to bring the love more perfectly to life in fiction than it was in real life, an appeal to all of us to understand more fully what we are feeling, even though Duras realises the ironic truth that to learn from our mistakes we first have to make them.PostscriptI recently read a review of this film in which the reviewer said the film was weakened by the fact that Jane March couldn't act. The comment made me reflect on how often actresses who do nude scenes are said to be bad actresses. It's always sounded like puritanism to me: instead of saying it's bad to be naked you say the acting's bad. I thought the acting was good throughout this film. You cannot fault Tony Leung, one of the greats of the HK movie industry. Jane March was asked to play a young, inexperienced girl and her own acting inexperience helped her do a good job. She played a stranger in a strange land who was also a stranger in her own family slowly coming to self realisation through her own sensuality. March was believable through all this, and not only because she looked the part. But to get the most from the movie you can't just focus on Jane March, just as you can't just focus on Jeanne Moreau as she speaks Duras' words. You have to focus on both actresses at the same time. And if you do and you're a male you'll learn a lot about women.",5,Lovers and other strangers,1191196800,"10 1, 2007",2007,3928,"['Jean-Jacques', 'Annaud', 'Two', 'Brothers', 'Enemy', 'Gate', 'made', ""L'Amant"", 'Lover', '1992', 'wrote', 'script', 'story', 'autobiographical', 'novel', 'Marguerite', 'Duras', 'Anyone', 'who', 'heard', 'narrator', 'Hiroshima', 'Mon', 'Amour', 'film', 'Duras', 'scripted', 'Alain', 'Resnais', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'book', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'Annaud', 'faithful', 'Duras', 'most', 'beautiful', 'most', 'precise', 'prose', 'modern', 'writer', 'tone', 'ironic', 'detachment', 'reader', 'deep', 'emotional', 'process', 'describing.Annaud', 'risk', 'following', 'book', 'so', 'closely', 'film', 'literary', 'rather', 'cinematic', 'viewers', 'sometimes', 'find', 'empty', 'lacking', 'kind', 'melodramatic', 'intensity', ""'ve"", 'become', 'used', 'movies', 'reference', 'Hiroshima', 'Mon', 'Amour', 'perhaps', 'Annaud', 'two', 'parallel', 'narrative', 'streams', 'movie', 'device', 'making', 'great', 'movie.Viewers', 'especially', 'puritan', 'America', 'are', 'taken', 'aback', 'intensely', 'erotic', 'lovemaking', 'scenes', 'comprise', 'most', 'visual', 'content', 'movie', 'lovmaking', 'so', 'real', 'one', 'wonders', 'actors', 'were', 'really', 'doing', 'not', 'acting', 'think', 'were', 'Other', 'components', 'may', 'be', 'dwarfed', 'content', 'are', 'there', 'magnificent', 'photography', 'landscape', 'city', 'love', 'characters', 'have', 'home', 'racial', 'divide', 'Asian', 'European', 'overriding', 'theme', 'growing', 'up.The', 'second', 'narrative', 'stream', 'reflections', 'elderly', 'Duras', 'spoken', 'Jeanne', 'Moreau', 'non', 'acting', 'important', 'role', 'comments', 'actions', 'younger', 'self', 'are', 'depicted', 'film', 'essence', 'book', 'film', 'tender', 'nostalgic', 'tone', 'elder', 'Duras', 'innocence', 'ignorance', 'younger', 'one', 'experience', 'everyone', 'very', 'young', 'can', 'relate', 'grandiose', 'empty', 'generalisations', 'women', 'are', 'prostitutes', 'young', 'girl', 'friend', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'being', 'one', 'eagerness', 'sexual', 'experience', 'losing', 'one', 'virginity', 'becoming', ""'adult"", 'Focusing', 'one', 'own', 'overwhelming', 'reactions', 'cultivating', 'kind', 'blindness', 'reactions', 'others', 'looking', 'back', 'Duras', 'depth', 'passion', 'inspired', 'lover', 'looking', 'back', 'also', 'feelings', 'surface', 'so', 'self', 'confidently', 'detached', 'were', 'deeper', 'realised', 'lover', 'loved', 'life', ""L'Amant"", 'love', 'letter', 'lover', 'younger', 'self', 'attempt', 'bring', 'love', 'more', 'perfectly', 'life', 'fiction', 'was', 'real', 'life', 'appeal', 'understand', 'more', 'fully', 'what', 'are', 'feeling', 'even', 'Duras', 'ironic', 'truth', 'learn', 'mistakes', 'first', 'have', 'make', 'them.PostscriptI', 'recently', 'read', 'review', 'film', 'reviewer', 'said', 'film', 'was', 'weakened', 'fact', 'Jane', 'March', 'could', ""n't"", 'act', 'comment', 'made', 'reflect', 'how', 'often', 'who', 'do', 'scenes', 'are', 'said', 'be', 'bad', 'actresses', 'always', 'sounded', 'puritanism', 'instead', 'saying', 'bad', 'be', 'naked', 'say', 'acting', 'bad', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'fault', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'one', 'greats', 'HK', 'movie', 'industry', 'Jane', 'March', 'was', 'asked', 'play', 'young', 'inexperienced', 'girl', 'own', 'acting', 'inexperience', 'helped', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'played', 'stranger', 'strange', 'land', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'stranger', 'own', 'family', 'slowly', 'coming', 'self', 'realisation', 'own', 'sensuality', 'March', 'was', 'believable', 'not', 'only', 'looked', 'part', 'get', 'most', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'focus', 'Jane', 'March', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'focus', 'Jeanne', 'Moreau', 'Duras', 'words', 'have', 'focus', 'actresses', 'same', 'time', 'do', ""'re"", 'male', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'lot', 'women']",The Lover VHS

The crossing, on a ferry, of one of the branches of the Mekong, in the great plains of mud and rice of southern Indochina...A pretty young girl goes back to Saigon... She is standing on the deck, extremely defiant, wearing a silk dress, a pair of 'cabaret' high heels, and a man's hat... She is approached by an elegant dark man from Cholon who is also crossing the Mekong that day towards Saigon... 'I like your hat. It's original. A man's hat on a young girl,' he expresses, and continues: 'If you want I can drive you to Saigon.'The rich Chinese playboy with a black Rolls-Royce is 32 years old, from that financial minority that owns all the popular housing of the colony... He's back from Paris where he undertook some business studies...The film, beautifully shot, is a dreamy fantasy of escape through sex... The escape is that of the poor French teenager from the horror of her house in Sa-Dec... While the girl merely abides her innocent mother, she loves her younger brother poetically, without reserve... Her brother is handsome but not bright, romantic but terribly fragile... She fears her elder brother, a brutal and lawless dissolute man, stupidly dependent on his mother... The inexperienced girl wants to see him in pain...The most remarkable aspect of the story is the strength of character of the young girl who is always a little sad... She finds the strength to proceed against the forbidden with a calm determination... ""I've never followed anyone into a room yet.,"" she exclaims...The room was dark, shipwrecked, surrounded by the never-ending clamor of the town, carried away by the flow of the town... Her body was in that public noise... Their love was erotic, immediate, unrestrained... It was physical, violent, devastating...But the girl loves other young woman in the boarding house, the 17-year-old Helen... Her passion for Helene is intense... Helen is immodest... She don't realize she walks naked in the dormitory... She doesn't know that she's very beautiful... She's innocent lingering on in youth...'The Lover' parallels the life of Duras herself... The setting, in Indochina, is one she knows intimately... The story is set mostly in the early 1920s following the decline of French domination of the territory that is now Vietnam... The film is the most exciting journey along a winding river of passion, which ultimately flows to the sea...Jean-Jacques Annaud handles the story with real sensuality, romance and dramatic power... He shots much of the film with a distinguished style...Jane March is attractive, but not obviously beautiful... Her impressionable teenager's gradual understanding of sexuality is well presented... She was subjected to a close, penetrating gaze by Annaud's camera..Tony Leung, as the rich Chinaman, is the lusty son unable to escape his family's commands...Although unseen, Jeanne Moreau jaded voice narrates the action and imparts a special flavor...

If you have an interest in this subject you will like the movie and see it as deep and profound, otherwise it will seem shallow and bore you because of the incompletely developed side plots.There are many side plots.  Sexual awakening of a young girl, mentioned in other reviews, seems to be a side plot, though fairly well developed.  Chemistry between adolescent girls, the jealousy and competition among siblings, these are introduced but left frustratingly undeveloped.  It would have made the movie too long.It works out much better than Lolita where the girl dies and the man is jailed for murder, but not as well as Psyche where through the diligence of her magical helpers and the deviousness of Venus there is a complete conversion from secret mistress to immortal wife, the oldest and most famous in literature.  The difference I believe is in the respect the older lover shows for the girl and her family, even though they don't deserve it.  This redeems his character as compared to Lolita's blundering lover who covers up his mistakes and takes no responsibility for outcomes.  But though responsible in the present this lover takes no responsibility for the future, unlike Cupid who insists on charging against fate and tradition (though sensibly so, and only after he has tested his companion).The young girl also takes responsibility, entering the relationship with deliberate awareness.  The whole film/novel is in fact an exercise/lesson in self awareness.  But she is incomplete compared to Psyche, who allows herself to feel deeply enough to be moved while movement still matters.By comparison the story also shows the role of circumstance.  In Psyche's story, Cupid's mother (wittingly or unwittingly, a subject for debate) plays an important role in putting the couple together.  In The Lover, his mother has died but her strong memory as evidenced by the sad state of his father sets the stage for love.  In Lolita, the man's mother is absent altogether and so is his respect for his partner or her family or any sense of personal responsibility.What follows is somewhat of a spoiler.  I believe the movie shows the seven stages of an affair: infatuation, lust, love, rape, impotence, longing and reunion.  By omission it shows what an affair is not.  It is not the long term building of a family.  Had the girl become pregnant as Psyche did what would have happened?  It seems likely that in real life this would have happened, and then real choices would have to be made.",4,"improved Lolita, incomplete Psyche, seven stages of an affair",1171584000,"02 16, 2007",2007,2651,"['alliance', 'convenience', 'rich', 'man', 'needy', 'young', 'girl', 'explored', 'phases', 'taken', 'final', 'conclusion', 'decades', 'later', 'have', 'interest', 'subject', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'see', 'deep', 'profound', 'otherwise', 'will', 'seem', 'shallow', 'bore', 'incompletely', 'developed', 'side', 'are', 'many', 'side', 'plots', 'Sexual', 'awakening', 'young', 'girl', 'mentioned', 'other', 'reviews', 'be', 'side', 'plot', 'fairly', 'well', 'developed', 'Chemistry', 'adolescent', 'girls', 'jealousy', 'competition', 'siblings', 'are', 'introduced', 'left', 'frustratingly', 'undeveloped', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'too', 'long.It', 'out', 'much', 'better', 'Lolita', 'where', 'girl', 'dies', 'man', 'jailed', 'murder', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'Psyche', 'where', 'diligence', 'magical', 'helpers', 'deviousness', 'Venus', 'complete', 'conversion', 'secret', 'mistress', 'immortal', 'wife', 'oldest', 'most', 'famous', 'literature', 'difference', 'believe', 'respect', 'older', 'lover', 'shows', 'girl', 'family', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'character', 'compared', 'Lolita', 'blundering', 'lover', 'who', 'up', 'mistakes', 'responsibility', 'outcomes', 'responsible', 'present', 'lover', 'responsibility', 'future', 'Cupid', 'who', 'charging', 'fate', 'tradition', 'sensibly', 'so', 'only', 'tested', 'companion', '.The', 'young', 'girl', 'also', 'responsibility', 'entering', 'relationship', 'deliberate', 'awareness', 'whole', 'film/novel', 'fact', 'exercise/lesson', 'self', 'awareness', 'incomplete', 'compared', 'Psyche', 'who', 'feel', 'deeply', 'enough', 'be', 'moved', 'movement', 'still', 'comparison', 'story', 'also', 'role', 'circumstance', 'Psyche', 'story', 'Cupid', 'mother', 'wittingly', 'unwittingly', 'subject', 'debate', 'important', 'role', 'putting', 'couple', 'together', 'Lover', 'mother', 'died', 'strong', 'memory', 'evidenced', 'sad', 'state', 'father', 'stage', 'love', 'Lolita', 'man', 'mother', 'absent', 'altogether', 'so', 'respect', 'partner', 'family', 'sense', 'personal', 'responsibility.What', 'somewhat', 'spoiler', 'believe', 'movie', 'seven', 'stages', 'affair', 'infatuation', 'lust', 'love', 'rape', 'impotence', 'longing', 'reunion', 'omission', 'what', 'affair', 'not', 'not', 'long', 'term', 'building', 'family', 'Had', 'girl', 'become', 'pregnant', 'Psyche', 'did', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'likely', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'then', 'real', 'choices', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'made']",The Lover VHS

He is a rich ""Chinese man"" who tells her in the beginning that he doesn't want to do this, because he could fall in love with her. Forbidden love is always the best love. Yet, this love is ever lasting. The scenery is beautiful. Awesome photography, beautiful flowing music. At first, I wasn't too sure of this movie, but as I got lost in the story, I was so sorry it ended the way it did. It had no other way of ending! Chinese men with white women, was only for men with whores. White women, with Chinese men, was only for the money. How CAN a movie such as this, end any other way? Even in France, racial mixes such as this weren't allowed. There was no were for this couple to go. She (the girl) couldn't tell even her family the truth, and while he (the Chinese man) tried to tell his Father, he HAD to marry of Chinese decent. What a sad love story.

411582,A2AJMMNO4S3IK,6304286384,"Tintin ""tintin75""","[128, 135]","Before being a cinematographic success The Lover (fr. l'Amant) is a masterpiece of literature, an autobiographical novel written by Marguerite Duras in 1984, in which the author reveals her torrid adolescent relationship with an older and affluent Chinese man in the Saigon of the 1930s.  Very few adaptations of novels to the screen have ever been rendered so faithfully.  Annaud is known for the meticulousness with which he approaches the details of his films, including the historical ones, and The Lover is no exceptionThe story is an interior monologue so laconically written that the film's characters aren't even named.  Jane Marsh, la jeune fille (""the girl""), acting is effortless and natural, portraying perfectly the ferocious individuality of the adolescent girl. Her resemblance to young Duras is uncanny.  Tony Leung Ka Fai, the ""Chinaman,"" is convincing in the role of the vulnerable aristocratic.The soundtrack, by Gabriel Yared, follows the action well, complementing the scenes, without overwhelming them.  The theme, ""l'Amant,"" is equally poetic and lyrical as the text.  The dialogue is the manifestation of Duras's writing, and the voice-over sequences are taken verbatim from the novel.  The genius of Annaud is again apparent in his choice of Jeanne Moreau for the narrator's part.  Moreau's world-weary, destroyed voice could not have been better for conveying the tone of Duras's lyrical writing.I was rather disappointed while reading more than a dozen American reviews of this film penned by professional film critics. Only one reviewer seemed to be knowledgeable about the author and the position she occupies in world literature.  Even one of the most respected film critics, Roger Ebert, seems to have missed the point of the film altogether, and dismissed it lightly. The majority of the film critics concentrated somewhat obsessively on the sexual scenes (which I must admit are rather explicit), to the exclusion of the other themes, and pronounced it soft-core pornography.  Since the running time of the film is 111 minutes, and only eight percent of it (a total of nine minutes) shows the two protagonists in explicitly sexual situations, including four and one half of actual lovemaking, I personally think the film hardly qualifies as soft-porn.  In my opinion, these movie reviews are the result of the genetic, generic puritan attitude that prevails in the American society.  Or maybe the reviewers were asleep during most of the film and only woke up for the ""good parts?""  So, let's put to bed (no pun intended) the question that this film is somehow pornographicThe Lover is a powerful emotional text, probing deep into the past of the narrator and into France's own colonial past.  It explores the intimate relationship between a young, poor white schoolgirl and her rich Chinese lover in the setting of the colonial society of the late 1920s Saigon.  It uncovers transgression, desire, separation, and death, the ecstatic and dangerous appeal of the mysterious ""other.""The other, arguably as important, theme of the film is relationships -- with her school friend, Helene Lagonelle, the ambivalent tie between the girl and her mother, and the girl's disturbing relationships with her two brothersFinally, there is an undercurrent theme which runs throughout the film, which is that of boundaries and borders. The film opens with a ferry ride across the Mekong and ends with an ocean crossing, signaling the constant crossing of frontiers and borders: geographic of course, but also racial, cultural, and sexual.  These are confronted and sometimes dissolved as the poor white girl of French parentage meets her wealthy Chinese lover in the Cholon, the ill-repute Chinese district of Saigon. She, a white girl, was raised among natives, almost as a native.  He is a native who experienced the western culture and somehow longs for it.There is also the transitory period of the girl's adolescence, between what remains of her childhood, and the onset of her womanhood. On the ferry and on the steam liner, the girl wears a child's pigtails, but she is dressed in women's clothes.  The gender roles are somewhat blurred, too: she wears a woman's dress, but also a man's hat, in a color that signifies femininity.  The boarding school in Saigon is home mainly to the abandoned mixed-blood daughters of local women and French fathers. The girl has an intimate friendship with Helene Lagonelle, which is ambivalent and perhaps sexually charged. The girl is unable to treat the Chinaman with even a modicum of courtesy when she is with her brothers because he is Chinese, not white. In the public bus, she rides in front, separated from the locals, yet in her private home, she lived as a native. In the cocoon of the garconniere, she is separated from the crowd on the street by only thin cotton blinds. There is even a meta-boundary crossed, as Duras takes her memories and feelings and externalizes them in the form of her writing.  What has been internal and private becomes external and public.The Lover is an autobiographical love story set in a post-colonial environment.  We owe the remarkable transcription of this literary masterpiece to the artistry and creativity of Jean-Jacques Annaud. In this production, he has successfully combined two art forms, the beauty of the written word with the fascination of the image. I believe that the film has been, for the most part, misunderstood in this country, and I would recommend a second, more open-minded look at it.  It will be a worthwhile experience.",5,Of boundaries and borders,1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,5550,"['being', 'cinematographic', 'success', 'Lover', 'fr', ""l'Amant"", 'masterpiece', 'literature',

411585,A1IFHFXIHESV28,6304286384,"William M. Feagin ""music dealer/geek""","[1, 4]","This film explores the boredom and frustration of a young French girl who commences an affair with an older, affluent Chinese man; their trysts in his home are her only escape from a rather boring boarding-school life and her highly dysfunctional family (alcoholic ineffectual mother, tyrannical and racist older brother, dishrag of a younger brother).I first saw this film in 1994, curious because I had heard one of the scenes of Jane March and Tony Leung gave the appearance of them actually having sex while being filmed (and just see how controversy generates interest!).  Granted, the scene in question is ambiguous, but I found this to be of minor importance.  The film itself is beautifully photographed, but rather disturbing.What disturbs me?  The scene where March appears to be raped--what, in fact, it is, could probably be best described as ""grudge sex.""  They have spent an evening with her mother and brothers, the mother having been drunk and asking for money from Leung's character, the older brother being openly hostile and challenging Leung to a fight.  Leung's character is thus angry--he slaps March's face, then throws her on the bed and takes her.  She, through this scene, looks bored and annoyed herself.  This scene, apart from the other sex scenes in the film, is distinctly unappealing.Further, the character of the older brother, who comes off as tyrannical, pugnacious and determined to trample his family down.  These two scenes, taken together, make for an uncomfortable reminder of the families of some acquaintances I have known.For those scenes, and the shallow premise of the film, I dock this film a star.  That said, it is beautifully filmed and deeply erotic--I particularly liked the relationship between the female protagonist (March) and her lovely schoolmate who ""walks naked through the dormitory (and) has no idea how beautiful she is.""
