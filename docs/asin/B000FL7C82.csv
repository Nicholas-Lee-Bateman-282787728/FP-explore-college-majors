It makes a sort of dream-sense, although it would be difficult to try to explain to the uninitiated what it's all about.  I love this young actor, Nick Stahl, who plays Ben Hawkins.  He looks like he walked out of a 1930s postcard, as does Jonesy, Sampson, Sophie and the rest of the carnies (although Adrienne Barbeau looks out of place:  too much plastic surgery perhaps? or not enough?).

If the CBS network would think about it, this would be a great show to follow ""The Ghost Whisperer"". You could even overlap the plots. ""The Ghost Whisperer"" could find some antique tarot cards that once belonged to Appolonia The Fortune teller.  Appy's ghost could visit Melinda, ""The Ghost Whisperer"" and ask her to save her daughter.  Melinda could then do the research and discover how Appy died and search for Sophia via a spooky time travel episode. This would set up the ""Carnivale"" for a Season Three finale. All the fans of this show want to know: (1) Did Jonesy die after Sophia shot him? (2) Did Ben get another shot at killing The Preacher?(3) Is Sophia pregnant with Ben's child? If so, does this make the child half devil and half angel? (4) If Sophia healed The Preacher how does this make her the Omega/Usher? (5) Does Iris get to stab Brother Justin like her vision showed? (6) And what happens to Samson and the rest of the Carnies?If CBS doesn't bite I suggest that The CW could use ""Carnivale"" as a show to follow ""Supernatural"". Same type of viewer for both shows. Or maybe the SciFi Channel or Showtime. Heck even AMC would be great. This would be a good addition to the original programming they have already, i.e. ""Breaking Bad"" and ""Mad Men"". I hope someone who loves this show will let the producers read this review.  It's a shame to let such a beautiful gem sit on the shelf.

Still, there was something there, story-wise, that was appealing, although at the time, I had no idea what it was. Another reason I kept watching was how ""beautiful"" it was. Not to say that the 1930s, depression-era setting was uplifting, but it came across as so authentic that it almost had a documentary feel to it.Needless to say, if you're reading this now, chances are you've seen it and you know that it all came together in the second season. And did it ever! Never in the history of television (or movies for that matter), was anything created that was this complex and was telling a story that could be taken on so many different levels.A major disappointment was when HBO cancelled it. Something as unique and produced to perfection could have easily gone on for the standard 5 years that HBO gives most of its shows. Still, the writers managed to wrap it up in the most satisfactory manner. Also, after realizing how deep this Carnivale was after its conclusion, I regretted not having the opportunity to see it again from episode #1.Now, with its new low price (surprisingly, only if bought as separate seasons and not as a complete series), the opportunity to view this most magnificent show from start to finish is finally here! Season One makes so much more sense now than it did the first go-round.But wait! There's more! As previously stated, this show is so complex and can be taken on so many levels, that watching it one more time won't be enough. First, watch it straight through, as-is. Second, watch it again with the commentary. Then, watch it again without the commentary. Finally, put it away for a month and watch it yet again. The more you see it, the more you realize how very special this epic was on every level there is: production, story, acting, etc., and perhaps most importantly, a deeper understanding of Carnivale as a whole.This was not only the best cancelled TV show of all time; it was the best TV show of all time, period. Nothing is in its league. This is television that challenges you to think on so many different levels... see it for what it is and see it to learn what lies beneath the surface.I've now seen this series three times and I know that in a way, it's only just begun... that I'll watch it again and again, and each time, I'll learn more than I did before because it's depth is something never attempted before. Perhaps that's why it was cancelled? Because it was simply too artistic, too intelligent, or too deep for the average viewer to stick with it?If you watched the whole show once on HBO, or especially if you only saw a few episodes and gave up on it, by all means, buy both seasons (separately to save approximately $60 at the time of this writing), and watch it again.

HBO, in their wisdom, cancelled this amazing work of visual literature to make room for- hell, I don't know. Big Love, maybe? This flagrant injustice can never be remedied, but we can all  salve our wounded hearts with this DVD set.Where do I start? To I mention the incredible writing of Daniel Knauf and his staff? The astonishing attention to detail paid to recreate the reality of the Depression and the Dust Bowl, in order that this story be more artfully rendered? Do I mention the sweeping, sense-rattling plotline- that travels like a slow-moving tornado throughout this season? Do I mention the shocking violence, startlingly imaginative imagery, red-hot sex and rollicking ol' time religion that animates these plots? Do I mention the almost unbearable tension of the apocalyptic struggle this series portrays, closely mirroring present day events? Do I mention the astonishingly gifted cast- including Nick Stahl, Clea Du Vall, Clancy Brown, Amy Madigan, Adrienne Barbeau, Tom DeKay and on and on ad infinitum. The worst actor on Carnivale is the equal of the best on any network show.The  cancellation of this show- even on a boutique channel like HBO- is a sad statement on America's cultural and intellectual decline. Our collective intelligence is being drained away, and it's perhaps because Carnivale all too correctly portrayed our national decline in metaphor that it was unpalatable to  American Idol-loving couch potatoes. Carnivale defies categorization- it's a genre unto itself. It is passionate, provocative, confrontational and ultimately uplifting television. Scratch that- it's BETTER than television and freeing it from the submoronic drivel polluting the networks and cable channels and letting it stand on it's on is true justice.Some might complain that the story is unfinished, but I think the story ended on a much better note than many other shows. In a sense, it showed that the struggle continues today by leaving the story open. If you don't have the first season, pick it up. It's not as spell-bindingly amazing as season two, but it helps establish the players and the plot. Don't think of this as a TV series, think of it as an epic novel adapted to the screen. Put away your expectations and prepare to have your mind blown. This season is pure bloody MAGIC. It's as great as any story ever told.Do yourself a favor- buy this set.

The writing is phennomenal - almost too good, which may explain why the HBO series only lasted 2 seasons and was cancelled just when things were getting interesting.  Considering a lot of the drivel currently being aired, I wonder if Carnivale simply went over the heads of many viewers.  Another possibility is that Carnivale doesn't adhere to the typical social morals and so other viewers may have found it too critical of certain religious or societal taboos.Set in the great depression in the dustbowl of middle America, the story involves the classic struggle between good and evil, though nothing and no one are what they seem.  We are introduced to the characters of Carnivale - a traveling carnival replete with freak show, cooch show and whores with hearts of gold - and as the series unfolds over the existing 2 seasons, the viewer may be called upon to examine his/her own beliefs about the roles of good and evil, light and dark, and all the places in between.  How much of what we believe is really true, and how much is simply what we have been taught to believe?The sets and locations for Carnivale are unparalleled and create a mood of desperation, mystery and the human instinct for survival even under the worst conditions.  There's a lot of mysticism and good character development throughout.  The only flaw with Carnivale is that it ends without conclusion due to the cancellation by HBO.  There was a brief campaign by fans to revive the series, but to my knowledge, it ended without results.  Unfortunate, since the show is intelligent, thought-provoking, and haunting in a way that leaves the viewer contemplating the world of Carnivale long after the DVD has been put back in its little plastic case.Awesome stuff!",5,Too Good to Last,1273795200,"05 14, 2010",2010,1955,"['Carnivale', 'Complete', 'Second', 'SeasonThough', 'are', 'only', '2', 'seasons', 'Carnivale', 'originally', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', '5', '6', 'seasons', 'what', 'top', 'notch', 'regard', 'just', 'aspect', 'show', 'writing', 'phennomenal', 'almost', 'too', 'good', 'may', 'explain', 'why', 'HBO', 'series', 'only', 'lasted', '2', 'seasons', 'was', 'cancelled', 'just', 'when', 'things', 'were', 'getting', 'interesting', 'Considering', 'lot', 'drivel', 'currently', 'being', 'aired', 'wonder', 'Carnivale', 'simply', 'went', 'heads', 'many', 'viewers', 'possibility', 'Carnivale', ""n't"", 'adhere', 'typical', 'social', 'morals', 'so', 'other', 'viewers', 'may', 'have', 'found', 'too', 'critical', 'certain', 'religious', 'societal', 'taboos.Set', 'great', 'depression', 'dustbowl', 'middle', 'America', 'story', 'classic', 'struggle', 'good', 'evil', 'nothing', 'one', 'are', 'what', 'seem', 'are', 'introduced', 'characters', 'Carnivale', 'traveling', 'carnival', 'replete', 'freak', 'show', 'cooch', 'show', 'whores', 'hearts', 'gold', 'series', 'existing', '2', 'seasons', 'viewer', 'may', 'be', 'called', 'examine', 'his/her', 'own', 'beliefs', 'roles', 'good', 'evil', 'light', 'dark', 'places', 'How', 'much', 'what', 'believe', 'really', 'true', 'how', 'much', 'simply', 'what', 'have', 'been', 'taught', 'believe', 'sets', 'locations', 'Carnivale', 'are', 'unparalleled', 'create', 'mood', 'desperation', 'mystery', 'human', 'instinct', 'survival', 'even', 'worst', 'conditions', 'lot', 'mysticism', 'good', 'character', 'development', 'only', 'flaw', 'Carnivale', 'conclusion', 'due', 'cancellation', 'HBO', 'was', 'brief', 'campaign', 'fans', 'revive', 'series', 'knowledge', 'ended', 'results', 'Unfortunate', 'show', 'intelligent', 'thought-provoking', 'haunting', 'way', 'viewer', 'contemplating', 'world', 'Carnivale', 'long', 'DVD', 'been', 'put', 'back', 'little', 'plastic', 'case.Awesome', 'stuff']",Carnivale: Season 2

Season one, while a masterpiece, suffered critical hits for taking too long to develop, and thus, perhaps lost some viewership. The not-so-well-kept secret is that time it took to craft the characters is exactly what true fans of the series enjoyed.Some of the deep mystery and magic is gone from the second season, in favor of moving the plot along, but series creator Dan Knauf was so adept at his craft that he never allowed the series to become ho-hum and typical like other network series that delve into fantasy and science fiction.What ultimately killed this series was two-fold. 1. It lost viewers who didn't want to be bothered with trying to figure the mystery out instead of having it handed to them on a platter and 2. executives who lost their vision as to what the show stood for and didn't recognize the art for what it was.This show has created a cult following matched by few others in it's genre.

The first one arrived damaged, but Amazon shipped out its replacement immediately and it arrived within 2 business days.  We were very happy with Amazon's willingness and speed at resolving this problem.Basically, the following review is the same review we presented for the first season via it holds true on every level with the first season.As for the series itself.  It is a vey good series that makes you feel for the characters.  Furthermore, you can relate to many of these characters and the way they act just on the bases of time period the story alone.  There is strong religious aspects that are significantly twisted and thus anyone who might be offended by such should avoid this series.  In addition, there is ""a lot"" of nudity, sexually content/terminology, and occasional swearing which is unfortunate&#8230;but again, a bit realistic for the time and situations the characters exist in.  We understand why nudity was added, but feel it could have been cleaned up a bit, thus the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  Those aspects were most likely dirtied up just for HBO's purposes.  However, the story is interesting and enjoyable to watch.  Especially without commercials on this DVD set. It is a shame HBO cancelled the series.  However, it is easy to goggle this topic and you can find Daniel Knauf's (series creator) vision of how he wanted to end the series and discover what characters should have developed into.  We are not sure if the website we are listing will ever change, but as of now the website presenting this concluding information is: [...]As mentioned, this series does have nudity, sexually content/terminology, and swearing, so we do not recommend it to anyone that can be offended by such.  However, if you can look past all of that, the story does present an interesting chain of events that dwells into the historically accurate struggle of humanity during the times of the dust bowl and mythical aspects of how there is always a battle between good (the light) and evil (the dark).We hope this review helped.

Sure it had fans, just not enough. So to hell with those of us who loved Carnivale.They cut off ""Deadwood"" after three seasons when David Milch was expecting to end it in four. Deadwood has fans too, but alas not enough, so they'll screw those of us who love ""Deadwood"" also.""Rome"" may never get a second season, and will therefore also be cut short, and who cares what we think?

The bottom line is that most of these original series is the best reason to subscribe. Everything else HBO offers is movies we've already seen, or rented.If they can't commit to a series and decide at one point or another where they will end it BEFORE committing to it, then they are all in the wrong business.

992322,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B000FL7C82,Michael Crane,"[63, 66]","There has never been a show that has had such an impact on me like HBO's ""Carnivale.""  You can only imagine the heartbreak I went through when I found out that the show would not be renewed for another season.  In a world where there is so much pointless garbage on TV with no substance, no emotion and no thinking behind it (again, this is not always a bad thing), it was refreshing to see something that challenged us to the core like ""Carnivale"" did.  At long last, the second season has found its home on DVD.It's hard to describe such a show without giving too much away, but I will do my best.  The first season left off with Ben Hawkins (an unlikely savior and healer) and Brother Justin (a man who once served religion has now found his place along darkness and an ultimate evil)finally realizing their path in life and knowing who they really are.  Ben is scared and instructed by the mysterious Management on what he has to do in order to prevent the end of the world as we know it, but Ben is not so sure who is using him and who he can trust.  Yet, he knows that the key to the final battle between good and evil is his father, Henry Scudder.  The problem is that Brother Justin is also looking for Scudder, as he has some terrible, awful plans of his own for the world.  These two are states away, but finally they will meet and the fate of the world ultimately depends on who ends up coming up on top.  And that's only a part of the overwhelming and forceful epic that is known as ""Carnivale.""The second season is much more darker and unsettling than the first, and it never slows down.  As good as the first season was, the pace was very slow--but it had to be in order to set the pieces into place.  A lot of things that didn't make sense in the first season will come to light in this one.  The scenery, the look and feel of it all really cements this as a memorable and solid series that was quite possibly ahead of its time.  Not only does this show rely on great and hypnotic writing, but also the actors who give it their all and bring their characters to life.  With a show as complex as this, you have to have the writing and the characters, and this show has no problem delivering the goods on that front.  The DVD contains all 12 episodes and some very cool ""behind the scenes"" features that are worth seeing, along with commentaries on selected episodes.""Carnivale"" is not a show for everybody.  It's extremely dark, brutal and the themes can get pretty disturbing and unsettling, especially since it deals with the religous and spiritual world.  If you are a fan of the first season, then this is a must-see, even if we may never get another season ever again.  Sure, not everything will be answered, the last episode does leave us hanging, but all in all this season is very satisfying and is even more exciting and thrilling than the first.  If you're looking for something you've never seen before, check it out.  I'm just happy the second season has finally found a home.  I just wished that such a great show had more of a chance.  I don't think I'll ever see anything that will ever surpass this, and I believe I will think that way until my last breath.  -Michael Crane",5,"""When it comes to livin', dying is the easy part...""",1154304000,"07 31, 2006",2006,3203,"['never', 'been', 'show', 'had', 'such', 'impact', 'HBO', 'Carnivale', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'heartbreak', 'went', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'show', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'renewed', 'season', 'world', 'where', 'so', 'much', 'pointless', 'garbage', 'TV', 'substance', 'emotion', 'thinking', 'again', 'not', 'always', 'bad', 'thing', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'something', 'challenged', 'core', 'Carnivale', 'did', 'long', 'last', 'second', 'season', 'found', 'home', 'DVD.It', 'hard', 'describe', 'show', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'will', 'do', 'best', 'first', 'season', 'left', 'off', 'Ben', 'Hawkins', 'unlikely', 'savior', 'healer', 'Brother', 'Justin', 'man', 'who', 'once', 'served', 'religion', 'now', 'found', 'place', 'darkness', 'ultimate', 'evil', 'finally', 'realizing', 'path', 'life', 'knowing', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'Ben', 'scared', 'instructed', 'mysterious', 'Management', 'what', 'do', 'order', 'prevent', 'end', 'world', 'know', 'Ben', 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'who', 'using', 'who', 'can', 'trust', 'key', 'final', 'battle', 'good', 'evil', 'father', 'Henry', 'Scudder', 'problem', 'Brother', 'Justin', 'also', 'looking', 'Scudder', 'terrible', 'awful', 'plans', 'own', 'world', 'two', 'are', 'states', 'away', 'finally', 'will', 'meet', 'fate', 'world', 'ultimately', 'who', 'up', 'coming', 'up', 'top', 'only', 'part', 'overwhelming', 'forceful', 'epic', 'known', 'Carnivale', 'second', 'season', 'much', 'more', 'darker', 'unsettling', 'first', 'never', 'down', 'As', 'good', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'pace', 'was', 'very', 'slow', 'had', 'be', 'order', 'set', 'pieces', 'place', 'lot', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'first', 'season', 'will', 'come', 'light', 'one', 'scenery', 'look', 'feel', 'really', 'memorable', 'solid', 'series', 'was', 'quite', 'possibly', 'ahead', 'time', 'Not', 'only', 'show', 'rely', 'great', 'hypnotic', 'writing', 'also', 'actors', 'who', 'give', 'bring', 'characters', 'life', 'show', 'as', 'complex', 'have', 'have', 'writing', 'characters', 'show', 'problem', 'delivering', 'goods', 'front', 'DVD', '12', 'episodes', 'very', 'cool', 'scenes', 'features', 'are', 'worth', 'seeing', 'commentaries', 'selected', 'episodes', 'Carnivale', 'not', 'show', 'everybody', 'extremely', 'dark', 'brutal', 'themes', 'can', 'get', 'pretty', 'disturbing', 'unsettling', 'especially', 'religous', 'spiritual', 'world', 'are', 'fan', 'first', 'season', 'then', 'must-see', 'even', 'may', 'never', 'get', 'season', 'ever', 'again', 'Sure', 'not', 'everything', 'will', 'be', 'answered', 'last', 'episode', 'leave', 'hanging', 'season', 'very', 'satisfying', 'even', 'more', 'exciting', 'thrilling', 'first', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'check', 'out', ""'m"", 'just', 'happy', 'second', 'season', 'finally', 'found', 'home', 'just', 'wished', 'such', 'great', 'show', 'had', 'more', 'chance', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'anything', 'will', 'ever', 'surpass', 'believe', 'will', 'think', 'way', 'last', 'breath', '-Michael', 'Crane']",Carnivale: Season 2

Both seasons of the show weren't anything incrdibly special, but the potential was there as it appeared to be one of those shows that has a grander scheme of things that take place over the course of several seasons (much like the X-Files).  As the second season begins, Ben (Nick Stahl) is accused of murder, and Justin (Clancy Brown) establishes his own town and temple in California.  As it happens, the carnival is coming his way, with an inevitable collision course between Ben and Justin on the horizon.  All this and more depends on a man named Harry Scudder (John Savage) who is linked to both Ben and Justin, and he will help decide the outcome in the final battle between good and evil.  Even though things never do completely get wrapped up, there is a bit of closure as the season, and series, comes to a close, but one can't help but wonder what might have been had HBO decided to at least re-new the series for at least one more season.  Maybe, hopefully, somehow things can get wrapped up completely in some other medium; I mean hey, it worked for Joss Whedon's Firefly with the Serenity movie, and Carnivale would be just as deserving as well.",4,"Could have been something great, but alas, it came to an end",1155427200,"08 13, 2006",2006,1359,"['second', 'sadly', 'final', 'season', 'Carnivale', 'prime', 'example', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'truly', 'great', 'thanks', 'poor', 'ratings', 'soaring', 'production', 'costs', 'came', 'sad', 'end', 'seasons', 'show', 'were', ""n't"", 'anything', 'incrdibly', 'special', 'potential', 'was', 'there', 'appeared', 'be', 'one', 'shows', 'grander', 'scheme', 'things', 'take', 'place', 'course', 'several', 'seasons', 'much', 'X-Files', 'second', 'season', 'begins', 'Ben', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'accused', 'murder', 'Justin', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'own', 'town', 'temple', 'California', 'carnival', 'coming', 'way', 'inevitable', 'collision', 'course', 'Ben', 'Justin', 'horizon', 'more', 'depends', 'man', 'named', 'Harry', 'Scudder', 'John', 'Savage', 'who', 'linked', 'Ben', 'Justin', 'will', 'help', 'decide', 'outcome', 'final', 'battle', 'good', 'evil', 'Even', 'things', 'never', 'do', 'completely', 'get', 'wrapped', 'up', 'bit', 'closure', 'season', 'series', 'close', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'HBO', 'decided', 'least', 're-new', 'series', 'least', 'one', 'more', 'season', 'Maybe', 'hopefully', 'somehow', 'things', 'can', 'get', 'wrapped', 'up', 'completely', 'other', 'medium', 'mean', 'hey', 'worked', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Firefly', 'Serenity', 'movie', 'Carnivale', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'deserving', 'as', 'well']",Carnivale: Season 2

Season 2 is a continuation of where Season 1 left off. So, if you've missed the first season, you'll be pretty much lost here.As the story unfolds, you get more and more excited. This is how I felt watching each show. Ben Hawkins is coming to grips with his power, at the same time the priest is rising to power. The clash between good and evil is about to come, and we're left guessing what's going to happen throughout the way. The story takes a turn towards the dark side. Hope seems to be a luxury few can afford, the Carnival itself is not doing well. What will happen in the end? Who is Management? Is it all forseen or can Ben pave the steps to his own future? These are some of the questions going through my mind as I watched the episodes and I am sure looking forward to watching this show again because I am sure there were things I missed the first time round.Enough can't be said about the story. Bold, intelligent and creative would be some of the words I would use to describe it. The story never ceases to amaze me. It is so well crafted, episode after episode. Where Season 1 to me, was pretty slow to take off the ground...here it's full steam ahead. I was completely glued to the screen at all times. So cautious was I to NOT miss anything. I was really disappointed with the finale only because I heard this was the last season but it didn't have closure. I then found out that it was written for something like 4 seasons and HBO ended it for budget reasons. This was such a shame as I think the story would've developed to something really great, which is pretty rare in TV nowadays. The acting was superb across the board, no surprise there. And the music from Jeff Beal continues to dazzle me. I can safely say, quarter of this show's success can be attributed to the music. Ominous, calm, eerie...the music contributes real emotion to Carnivale.In short, if you've watched the 1st season and loved it, I don't know why you're even reading this review. Buy it already! If you have not, buy Season 1 and 2. If you're looking for an unconventional, original story that unravels slowly and surely to become a masterpiece...look no further, you've found it.",5,Mind-blowing...,1149379200,"06 4, 2006",2006,2287,"['Aaahh', 'finally', 'second', 'season', 'here', 'Carnivale', 'one', 'shows', 'grabs', 'right', 'start', 'Season', '2', 'continuation', 'where', 'Season', '1', 'left', 'off', 'So', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'first', 'season', ""'ll"", 'be', 'pretty', 'much', 'lost', 'story', 'unfolds', 'get', 'more', 'more', 'excited', 'how', 'felt', 'watching', 'show', 'Ben', 'Hawkins', 'coming', 'grips', 'power', 'same', 'time', 'priest', 'rising', 'power', 'clash', 'good', 'evil', 'come', ""'re"", 'left', 'guessing', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'way', 'story', 'turn', 'dark', 'side', 'Hope', 'be', 'luxury', 'few', 'can', 'afford', 'Carnival', 'not', 'doing', 'well', 'What', 'will', 'happen', 'end', 'Who', 'Management', 'forseen', 'can', 'Ben', 'pave', 'steps', 'own', 'future', 'are', 'questions', 'going', 'mind', 'watched', 'episodes', 'am', 'sure', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'show', 'again', 'am', 'sure', 'were', 'things', 'missed', 'first', 'time', 'round.Enough', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'story', 'Bold', 'intelligent', 'creative', 'would', 'be', 'words', 'would', 'use', 'describe', 'story', 'never', 'amaze', 'so', 'well', 'crafted', 'episode', 'episode', 'Where', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'pretty', 'slow', 'take', 'off', 'ground', 'here', 'full', 'steam', 'ahead', 'was', 'completely', 'glued', 'screen', 'times', 'So', 'cautious', 'was', 'NOT', 'miss', 'anything', 'was', 'really', 'disappointed', 'finale', 'only', 'heard', 'was', 'last', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'closure', 'then', 'found', 'out', 'was', 'written', 'something', '4', 'seasons', 'HBO', 'ended', 'budget', 'reasons', 'was', 'such', 'shame', 'think', 'story', 'would', ""'ve"", 'developed', 'something', 'really', 'great', 'pretty', 'rare', 'TV', 'nowadays', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'board', 'surprise', 'there', 'music', 'Jeff', 'Beal', 'dazzle', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'quarter', 'show', 'success', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'music', 'Ominous', 'calm', 'eerie', 'music', 'real', 'emotion', 'Carnivale.In', 'short', ""'ve"", 'watched', '1st', 'season', 'loved', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', ""'re"", 'even', 'reading', 'review', 'Buy', 'already', 'have', 'not', 'buy', 'Season', '1', '2', ""'re"", 'looking', 'unconventional', 'original', 'story', 'unravels', 'slowly', 'surely', 'become', 'masterpiece', 'look', 'further', ""'ve"", 'found']",Carnivale: Season 2
992329,AWOROFNE3S4W3,B000FL7C82,Phillip Frangules,"[2, 2]","In a perfect world Carnivale would have finished its intended run and been remembered as masterpiece of genre television. Unfortunately, we don't live in one and thus we only got two seasons before HBO cancelled it.Fortunately, the second season marked the end of the first 'book' of the series (the initial plan being that there would be six seasons divided into three 'books') and as such there is a definite payoff for viewers who have invested their time in watching the show. The overall storyline running through the first two seasons concludes and there's a sense of closure by the time it ends. It's definitely not an ending to the series proper (it ends on a bit of a cliffhanger) but you won't feel ripped off either. You will, however, want to curse the executives at HBO.The second season finds Ben and Brother Justin embracing their respective destinies in the battle between good and evil. Both men are told that they must find Ben's elusive father Henry Scudder; Justin must slay him to gain the full measures of his powers, whereas Ben has to find him to discover the identity of his nemesis and thus avert the coming apocalypse. It's only a matter of time before both sides come to a head. Meanwhile Sofie struggles to find her place in the world after tragedy strikes, the Dreifuss family run into a series of problems and Iris finds her past actions coming back to bite her. Needless to say, there's a lot going on here.I gave the first season five stars, but I gave the second one four. I wasn't sure what rating to give it. In some ways, this season is stronger. For starters, the second season is considerably more faster-paced and streamlined than the first season. A lot happens in the second season, probably more than anyone expected. There are a number of revelations and events here that if you were to ask me before the season started that, given the pacing of the first season, I would have guessed would have occurred a couple years down the line. Just imagine if in Lost, Jacob and the Man in Black were introduced in the second season and you'll get an idea of what I'm talking about. There's a much greater sense of how deep the mythology to the show is; if this much is covered in the first two seasons, imagine what could have happened in the next four? Additionally, the supporting characters are given more to do this time around. In particular Sofie has a much bigger role than she did in the first season and Clea DuVall really gets a chance to shine. As expected, pretty much everyone involved gives a great performance and the quality of the show's production is always top notch.Unfortunately, the season is weaker in some fundamental areas as well. Most of these come from HBO's executive meddling but the show is still impacted either way. The biggest issue is Justin's characterization. In the first season, he was easily the most compelling and tragic character on the show as he was fundamentally a good man struggling with his inner nature. While the first season ended with him effectively realizing that he was destined to be evil, it was clear he was still conflicted. From the start of the second season, he's essentially a full-blown villain.  This is largely HBO's fault as they were uncomfortable with the ambiguity present in the first season. Clancy Brown still give a great performance (one of the season's best scenes comes from him) but he was far more interesting in the first season. In some other areas, I found the latter episodes to be a bit rushed as they moved towards its conclusion. In particular, one significant plotline that was built up since the first season is given a rather anticlimactic send-off.Despite HBO treating the series like a redheaded stepchild, they still managed to give the series a quality DVD presentation. The series looks and sounds as good as the format will allow (this would look great in high definition). The extras are also improved from last season's set. We once again get three commentaries, but this time Knauf and co. are joined by one of three actors for each one; Nick Stahl, Clea DuVall and Clancy Brown. Their inclusion adds a lot and they make for some interesting and lively discussions. In terms of featurettes, whereas the last season had your standard EPK fluff, the second season has about an hour's worth of footage to peruse. First up is some footage from Museum of Television & Radio's William S. Paley Television Festival in which the cast and crew answer questions. There's a bit of sad irony here as Knauf and co. are under the impression that HBO is dedicated to sticking with the show to the ""bitter end"". Of special note is ""Magic and Myth"", a half-hour documentary on the show's mythology. There's some interesting information here, some of which viewers may have missed from the show.Despite some caveats, the second season of Carnivale is still a must-see. It's sad that we'll never get to see the series get its proper conclusion but at least we had two great seasons.",4,Truly had the potential to be something great,1328572800,"02 7,

And I still don't have a clue as to what is happening, what has happened, or where this is going.There are two venues:  the carnival and the preacher.  So far they have nothing to do with each other.  Let's take these separately.The carnival is about the sleaziest mud show on record.  The wagons have paint peeling.  The vehicles are rattletraps.  The ferris wheel and merry-go-round appear to lack minimum maintenance and are thus dangerous.  The denizens of this traveling show look as if they haven't had baths in months.  Their clothes are sweat stained and filthy, for the most part.  There are cooch dancers, a sword swallower, a lizard skinned man, a tarot card reader, a little person who may or may not be the boss, etc.  It is 1934, in the middle of the Great Depression and in the middle of America's dust bowl.The story is vague and mysterious.  A young man, who has just buried his mother, is virtually shanghaied by the carnival.  It appears that he has escaped from jail (he has on handcuffs).  It also seems that he has the power to heal broken bones, etc. immediately and that he is seeking his father (I don't see why).The preacher and his sister also travel around and there are plans to have a large ministry, perhaps even to become a radio preacher.Sometimes he is crazy and at times you might even think he is evil incarnate.  His escapades take up about 30% of the show, I would estimate.The acting is fine.  The atmosphere is fine.  The writing is fine.  I just don't get it.  A plot shouldn't take this long to unfold, and I can see why this collapsed.  Apparently the writers just didn't know where to go next.  Something has to happen in fiction.  There has to be movement in the plot.  This appears to be just a slice or two slices of life, and that's not good enough.LATER  OK, I've now seen every episode of Carnivale, and it still is vague and not worth the effort.  I don't like paranormal explanations for seemingly realistic events, and I don't like the vague references to Avatars or Knights Templar or other esoterica.I realize that this series was never finished, but it's obvious why:  people quit watching because the story wasn't going anywhere.  I patiently expected some great revelation, but it never came.The cinematography was excellent.  So were the sets.  The acting was fine in every respect.  It's the plot that caused the problems.

992335,A24K6KR7RHW7XB,B000FL7C82,Ron,"[0, 0]","I just finished watching both seasons of Carnival and I'm happy to report it was worth the time as this slow moving road trip finally reaches its destination.It was refreshing to see a show based in part on the depression and on a traveling stranger than strange carnival troupe made up of some odd characters. Some of the characters are likeable while others you could do without.The story is based on good Vs evil with the preacher Brother Justin Crowe ( Clancy Brown) being a servant of the evil and the stray cat picked up by the carnival Ben Hawkins (Nick Stahl) as the servant of ???. The story does have many religious referances throughout, but it's done in a way as to not be off putting to those who don't enjoy religion themed stories.The vehicle (pun intended) for the story is a traveling carnival that has a mysterious manager running the operation that both the viewer and the members of the carnival know little about  and most have never seen.The carnivals supervisor is Samson (Michael J. Anderson) who passes orders from &#34;management&#34; to the carnies along with the professor Ernst Lodz (Patrick Bauchau) are the only two members of the troupe that have contact with the management. This exclusive relationship with the two men along with the strange orders is a constant irritant to many in the troupe and plays a major role in the story.The show has many...many layers to it with all of the cast playing into the story/plot and sub plot and might leave some a little lost at time, but on the plus side the characters are very well developed.For me it moves a little to slow and I would lose my attention and focus or I would nod off.I don't know if the show was originally going to last only two seasons or not, but the way it ends made me believe that two seasons wasn't enough for the way the story playes out with Sofie (Clea DuVail)?Good story overall, but a bit slow and could be confusing to some with all the sub plots/characters. The story has a fair amount of semi graphic violence and contains many...many nude scenes (dancing, stripping and or sex scenes) and lets not forget the foul language including the f...word. There is a lot of religious references throughout the story for those who may be turned off, but again it wasn't in an off putting manner. 3+ stars.",3,TAKE THE LONG WAY HOME,1401753600,"06 3, 2014",2014,2304,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'seasons', 'Carnival', ""'m"", 'happy', 'report', 'was', 'time', 'slow', 'moving', 'road', 'trip', 'finally', 'destination.It', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'show', 'based', 'part', 'depression', 'traveling', 'stranger', 'strange', 'carnival', 'troupe', 'made', 'odd', 'characters', 'characters', 'are', 'likeable', 'others', 'could', 'do', 'without.The', 'story', 'based', 'good', 'Vs', 'evil', 'preacher', 'Brother', 'Justin', 'Crowe', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'being', 'servant', 'evil', 'stray', 'cat', 'picked', 'up', 'carnival', 'Ben', 'Hawkins', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'servant', 'story', 'have', 'many', 'religious', 'referances', 'done', 'way', 'not', 'be', 'off', 'putting', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'religion', 'themed', 'stories.The', 'vehicle', 'pun', 'intended', 'story', 'traveling', 'carnival', 'mysterious', 'manager', 'running', 'operation', 'viewer', 'members', 'carnival', 'know', 'little', 'most', 'have', 'never', 'seen.The', 'carnivals', 'supervisor', 'Samson', 'Michael', 'J.', 'Anderson', 'who', 'orders', '34', 'management', '34', 'carnies', 'professor', 'Ernst', 'Lodz', 'Patrick', 'Bauchau', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'members', 'troupe', 'have', 'contact', 'management', 'exclusive', 'relationship', 'two', 'men', 'strange', 'orders', 'constant', 'irritant', 'many', 'troupe', 'major', 'role', 'story.The', 'show', 'many', 'many', 'layers', 'cast', 'playing', 'story/plot', 'sub', 'plot', 'might', 'leave', 'little', 'lost', 'time', 'plus', 'side', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'developed.For', 'little', 'slow', 'would', 'lose', 'attention', 'focus', 'would', 'nod', 'off.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'show', 'was', 'originally', 'going', 'last', 'only', 'two', 'seasons', 'not', 'way', 'made', 'believe', 'two', 'seasons', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'way', 'story', 'out', 'Sofie', 'Clea', 'DuVail', 'Good', 'story', 'overall', 'bit', 'slow', 'could', 'be', 'confusing', 'sub', 'plots/characters', 'story', 'fair', 'amount', 'semi', 'graphic', 'violence', 'many', 'many', 'nude', 'scenes', 'dancing', 'stripping', 'sex', 'scenes', 'not', 'forget', 'foul', 'language', 'including', 'f', 'word', 'lot', 'religious', 'references', 'story', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'again', 'was', ""n't"", 'off', 'putting', 'manner', '3+', 'stars']",Carnivale: Season 2

I personally like season 2 better, it may seem like it moves a little fast, but it could be that maybe the creators of the show knew it wasn't gonna be picked up for any future seasons.The fast pace of the second season however, is something I particularly liked better than the first. The first season has more setup, especially with the characters, but the second season delivers. There's more action, more suspense, more everything.I'm fighting an urge to spoil anything for those who haven't seen season 2 of Carnivale. For those who liked season 1, you're in for a real treat, since season 2 is better and really fills in some blanks left from the first season.For those who have never seen an episode of Carnivale, I must recommend checking it out. Whether you rent it or buy it, it's a must view. For fans of mystery, suspense, horror, plus, in-depth characters, top-notch writing, and a story that leaves you wanting more, this show is for you.I do watch most all Hbo's original programming, and between Oz, Carnivale, The Wire, it's a toss-up which of their original shows I think is best (though Dream On will always have a soft spot).

This is one of the most sumptuous, vivid, intelligent and original series ever spun on TV.  That is surely what sounded its death knell - ""Carnivale"" must have been incredibly expensive to make, even though it cast very few recognizable actors.  Every artist must have its patron, and TV producers are no exception.Season One ended with a brilliant cliff-hanger, and Season Two does not flag one iota.  Brother Justin (Clancy Brown, never better) continues to grow into his satanic persona . . . it is hard to remember what a sympathetic man he was at the outset of the first season.  Ben (Nick Stahl) continues to struggle with his identity, but he has more purpose in this season, and he becomes an active seeker for his own destiny.  The series builds to a climactic showdown between these two.But as in Season One, the well-rounded cast of supporting characters continues to evolve in all their glorious, profane splendour.  Look for romance, heartbreak, major decisions, and, perhaps most importantly, for Sofie to learn the secret of her parentage.  To say that there are unexpected twists in the plot is an understatement, and I got dizzy trying to keep track of them all.""Carnivale"" is not for the squeamish.  For all its intelligent writing, ""Carnivale"" offers plenty of guilty pleasures for the viewer.  Season Two delivers plenty of skin, plenty of sex, plenty of blood, and great heaping piles of dark religious imagery.  Shun all spoilers!  The climactic episode of Season Two ends with a surprising and enigmatic twist.  It's clear that there is still plenty of story to be told, and let's hope that somebody finds the financing to pick up this series for another installment . . . or, perhaps, a major cinematic effort like ""Serenity"" was for the ill-fated series, ""Firefly.""Well, one can hope.",5,Carnivale's second season continues promise of first,1176163200,"04 10, 2007",2007,1904,"['colossal', 'disappointment', 'HBO', 'decided', 'not', 'renew', 'Carnivale', 'season', 'one', 'most', 'sumptuous', 'vivid', 'intelligent', 'original', 'series', 'ever', 'spun', 'TV', 'surely', 'what', 'sounded', 'death', 'knell', 'Carnivale', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'incredibly', 'expensive', 'make', 'even', 'cast', 'very', 'few', 'recognizable', 'actors', 'artist', 'must', 'have', 'patron', 'TV', 'producers', 'are', 'exception.Season', 'One', 'ended', 'brilliant', 'cliff-hanger', 'Season', 'Two', 'not', 'flag', 'one', 'iota', 'Brother', 'Justin', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'never', 'better', 'grow', 'satanic', 'persona', 'hard', 'remember', 'what', 'sympathetic', 'man', 'was', 'outset', 'first', 'season', 'Ben', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'struggle', 'identity', 'more', 'purpose', 'season', 'active', 'seeker', 'own', 'destiny', 'series', 'climactic', 'showdown', 'two.But', 'Season', 'One', 'well-rounded', 'cast', 'supporting', 'characters', 'evolve', 'glorious', 'profane', 'splendour', 'Look', 'romance', 'heartbreak', 'major', 'decisions', 'perhaps', 'most', 'importantly', 'Sofie', 'learn', 'secret', 'parentage', 'say', 'are', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'plot', 'understatement', 'got', 'dizzy', 'trying', 'keep', 'track', 'Carnivale', 'not', 'squeamish', 'intelligent', 'writing', 'Carnivale', 'plenty', 'guilty', 'pleasures', 'viewer', 'Season', 'Two', 'delivers', 'plenty', 'skin', 'plenty', 'sex', 'plenty', 'blood', 'great', 'heaping', 'piles', 'dark', 'religious', 'imagery', 'Shun', 'spoilers', 'climactic', 'episode', 'Season', 'Two', 'surprising', 'enigmatic', 'twist', 'clear', 'still', 'plenty', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'let', 'hope', 'somebody', 'financing', 'pick', 'up', 'series', 'installment', 'perhaps', 'major', 'cinematic', 'effort', 'Serenity', 'was', 'ill-fated', 'series', 'Firefly', 'Well', 'one', 'can', 'hope']",Carnivale: Season 2

I'm not a very big fan of the Sopranos, Deadwood doesn't look too bad, I've never seen it, but who knows perhaps I'll check it out on DVD eventually.This is right up there as one of my all time favorite shows, my bag is the X-Files, Twin Peaks, Northern Exposure type stuff and I remember seeing the first ep on HBO many years ago, and I knew from the get-go that this was gonna be a classic series, too bad it appears to be ending after season two.Nick Stahl and Clea Duvall are a great pair to watch, I forget some of the actors names but I love Stumpy, Jonesy, and of course Samson (who I just saw again in the last eps of Season Two of Twin Peaks last week).  The thing I like about these type of shows is how you can't wait to see what is around the corner, and it can be such a surprise, I think I watched two eps a day when I first got it, then it was 3 eps a day...doesn't take long to get through the entire season, but you can get lost in these characters and the times, as rough as it seemed back then, it sure looked like at times they were just throwing caution to the wind and just having a good time. It's a world where anything seems possible, it's a world where nothing is what it seems, always something to learn. Of course in the second season, it becomes a mission for Ben to follow his path, and at times can be a disturbing journey, it's a dangerous world now, and all the innocence seems to have been shed...but of course it is necessary in order for the show to grow and for the full story to be told, by the middle of season two you care so much about these characters, I felt so bad for Jonesy and Stumpy at times, and Ben just has so much stuff thrown at him all at once it seems.The dialogue is superb I think, how accurate it is to the times might be fuzzy sometimes and the commentatary sometimes explains, they sometimes just winged it, but for Carny speak of the 30's, they probably were not far off. The dialogue along with great actors and actresses makes this show worth checking out. It's great to watch Ben finally give in to his gift and start to learn and go with it instead of pushing everyone away keeping it to himself, in the first season he was very distant and at times downright hostile towards any type of inquiry or even friendship, but in season two we finally see him start to grow up and face his destiny....and it's a heckuva ride.",5,Shake some dust,1178668800,"05 9, 2007",2007,2711,"['was', 'very', 'happy', 'get', 'season', 'two', 'Carnivale', 'cancelled', 'HBO', 'right', 'season', 'one', 'ended', 'out', 'was', 'only', 'show', 'was', 'watching', 'time', 'there', 'just', 'decided', 'save', 'up', 'money', 'buy', 'DVD', 'year', 'was', 'hoping', 'get', 'one', 'year', 'apparently', 'show', 'ended', 'sesaon', 'two', ""'m"", 'not', 'very', 'big', 'fan', 'Sopranos', 'Deadwood', ""n't"", 'look', 'too', 'bad', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'who', 'perhaps', ""'ll"", 'check', 'out', 'DVD', 'eventually.This', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'shows', 'bag', 'X-Files', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'type', 'stuff', 'remember', 'seeing', 'first', 'ep', 'HBO', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'knew', 'get-go', 'was', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'classic', 'series', 'too', 'bad', 'be', 'ending', 'season', 'two.Nick', 'Stahl', 'Clea', 'Duvall', 'are', 'great', 'pair', 'watch', 'forget', 'actors', 'names', 'love', 'Stumpy', 'Jonesy', 'course', 'Samson', 'who', 'just', 'saw', 'again', 'last', 'eps', 'Season', 'Two', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'last', 'week', 'thing', 'like', 'type', 'shows', 'how', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'corner', 'can', 'be', 'such', 'surprise', 'think', 'watched', 'two', 'eps', 'day', 'when', 'first', 'got', 'then', 'was', '3', 'eps', 'day', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'get', 'entire', 'season', 'can', 'get', 'lost', 'characters', 'times', 'as', 'rough', 'seemed', 'back', 'then', 'sure', 'looked', 'times', 'were', 'just', 'throwing', 'caution', 'wind', 'just', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'world', 'where', 'anything', 'possible', 'world', 'where', 'nothing', 'what', 'always', 'something', 'learn', 'course', 'second', 'season', 'mission', 'Ben', 'follow', 'path', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'disturbing', 'journey', 'dangerous', 'world', 'now', 'innocence', 'have', 'been', 'shed', 'course', 'necessary', 'order', 'show', 'grow', 'full', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'middle', 'season', 'two', 'care', 'so', 'much', 'characters', 'felt', 'so', 'bad', 'Jonesy', 'Stumpy', 'times', 'Ben', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'stuff', 'thrown', 'once', 'seems.The', 'dialogue', 'superb', 'think', 'how', 'accurate', 'times', 'might', 'be', 'fuzzy', 'sometimes', 'commentatary', 'sometimes', 'sometimes', 'just', 'winged', 'Carny', 'speak', '30', 'probably', 'were', 'not', 'far', 'off', 'dialogue', 'great', 'actors', 'actresses', 'show', 'checking', 'out', 'great', 'watch', 'Ben', 'finally', 'give', 'gift', 'start', 'learn', 'go', 'instead', 'pushing', 'everyone', 'away', 'keeping', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'very', 'distant', 'times', 'downright', 'hostile', 'towards', 'type', 'inquiry', 'even', 'friendship', 'season', 'two', 'finally', 'see', 'start', 'grow', 'up', 'face', 'destiny', '.and', 'heckuva', 'ride']",Carnivale: Season 2

How do two people in a raging fire walk out unscathed? I thought they died now - POOF! - here they are again. It went downhill from there for me so I didn't think I would even finish watching it. The changes in relationships and characters just didn't make sense to me. The weirdness just got a bit too weird. I hung in there and at the end, I am glad I did. I got it.The last 3 episodes of the season cruise swiftly to a peak of suspense and end gloriously. I wish the last moments were different (deleted) but it feels finished. There were twists, turns, and surprises. It always remained interesting.I didn't give it 5 stars because of the slow, weird start and because there are problems with the plot. It doesn't make sense that Ben would suddenly be able to drain health and life from Justin when he wasn't able to know for sure where the energy/life would come from before. It doesn't make sense that Sofie, a neophyte, would be able to bring Justin back to life using the corn when Justin couldn't do that for Ruthie. It doesn't make sense that Jonesy would suddenly fall in love with Libby- lust, yes. Love, no. How does a guy who had a stroke shoot a gun when he doesn't have control enough to feed himself? It's all good. Whatever. It doesn't ruin it, just makes it less than perfect.",4,Goes Into Shark Jumping Territory,1393027200,"02 22, 2014",2014,1410,"['lt', 'lt', 'lt', 'lt', 'SPOILERS', 'AHEAD', '>', '>', '>', '>', '>', '>', 'loved', 'first', 'season', 'first', 'episode', 'second', 'season', 'made', 'sick', 'How', 'do', 'two', 'people', 'raging', 'fire', 'walk', 'unscathed', 'thought', 'died', 'now', 'POOF', 'here', 'are', 'again', 'went', 'downhill', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'even', 'finish', 'watching', 'changes', 'relationships', 'characters', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'weirdness', 'just', 'got', 'bit', 'too', 'weird', 'hung', 'end', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'got', 'it.The', 'last', '3', 'episodes', 'season', 'cruise', 'swiftly', 'peak', 'suspense', 'end', 'gloriously', 'wish', 'last', 'moments', 'were', 'different', 'deleted', 'finished', 'were', 'twists', 'turns', 'surprises', 'always', 'remained', 'interesting.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', '5', 'stars', 'slow', 'weird', 'start', 'are', 'problems', 'plot', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Ben', 'would', 'suddenly', 'be', 'able', 'drain', 'health', 'life', 'Justin', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'know', 'sure', 'where', 'energy/life', 'would', 'come', 'before', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Sofie', 'neophyte', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'bring', 'Justin', 'back', 'life', 'using', 'corn', 'when', 'Justin', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'Ruthie', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Jonesy', 'would', 'suddenly', 'fall', 'love', 'Libby-', 'lust', 'yes', 'Love', 'How', 'guy', 'who', 'had', 'stroke', 'shoot', 'gun', 'when', ""n't"", 'have', 'control', 'enough', 'feed', 'good', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'just', 'less', 'perfect']",Carnivale: Season 2

NO ONE else could have done his role in Carnivale not at all!The first season was the best and the second season did gave so much answers to the questions but they knew they were cancelling and so it all was just rushed. Its a shame that it ended it was a great story/plot/whatever but than again it makes sense that they didnt let it continue cuz of other producers and writers tastes and blah blah but if you think about it, how can this kind of story about good and bad really end?? there is no ending and will never will be and I think thats what they were getting at with the ending as well.

While some say the first season moved too slow, the second season took off and your feet would never touch the ground again. By now everyone knows the plot. The great depression, battle of good versus evil in a supernatural battle for world domination, all set around a traveling group of rag-tag carnies going from city to city just to exist. Each member with a secret and each fitting into a perfect 3D puzzle. Thrust into this, the great satan of Brother Justin and the reluctant Ben Hawkins who does not want to face up to his destiny. Even the final battle was not the end. Season three would have been just as mind blowing if not for the rocket scientists who run HBO.Despite the huge campaign, those same people have ignored the great hue and cry to resurrect the series. Much in the same mind frame as NBC executives in 1968 when Star Trek was cancelled. Personally, I cancelled my subscription to HBO and have never looked back. For anyone into Stephen King, see this and realize just how inadequate the ""master"" is when compared to a really great gothic horror series.
