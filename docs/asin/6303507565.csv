The new Blu-ray is quite good.  Yeah!ORIGINAL REVIEW:I purchased the latest A BOY AND HIS DOG from amazon based on the aspect ratio listing as 2.35:1 widescreen - and the following paragraph in Michael R. Gates's review in this site stating:Several DVD editions of A BOY AND HIS DOG have been available over the past few years, and all have delivered good letterbox widescreen digital transfers.  THE CURRENT OFFERING FROM FIRST RUN FEATURES IS AN ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN VERSION,  and it also contains an interesting feature commentary and theatrical trailers.In fact, the currect offering is not anamorphic, but letterboxed - and purchasing a DVD with a film in 2.35:1 aspect ratio that is letterboxed is a great mistake as you will only see the movie in a very small portion of your screen making it not a pleasant experience.  Even if you zoom it up - the grain becomes a problem.I called First Run Features and they tell me that they have not changed the presentation of this film on DVD since they have distributed it - and it is, indeed, letterboxed.  There is no anamorphic version from First Run Features they tell me as of March 2011 and they did not know of any near future plan to release an anamorphic version.So, there it is.  If Mr. Gates can tell me where I can get an anamorphic version of the film - please let us all know.

378175,A3Y6GNHCOER58,6303507565,Billie Mann,"[4, 6]","""A Boy And His Dog"" is definately a cult classic, but defies being more neatly categorized beyond that genre. It's been labeled alternately and collectively as being ""misogynistic"", ""the greatest Science Fiction movie ever made"", ""black comedy"", and as a ""cross between George Orwell and Mel Brooks"" (the last description is my personal favorite), to list a few. Although it is true that the film is rather misogynistic, I don't find this a fault; the film is supposed to be portraying a terrible, possible future reality. And it may not be nice, folks.""A Boy And His Dog"" was directed by L.Q. Jones, a character bit actor favored by Sam Peckinpah for his westerns, and is based on the novella of the same name by Sci-Fi legend Harlan Ellison (who by all accounts loved the film version).It takes place in the year 2024, after WWIV has ravaged the earth's civilization, rendering it into a post-apocalyptic desert, where humans have become complete scavengers. A very young, relatively unknown Don Johnson (way before his days in TV's ""Miami Vice"") stars as Vic, a young ""solo"" as the loners are called, trying to stay alive in this post-atomic desert of a world. Veteran actor Jason Robards appears in a small part, as a favor to Jones. Vic's companion, friend and mentor is a sheepdog named Blood. The dog, named Tiger in real life, was a very popular animal actor of the times, an extremely well-trained and appealing performer, and in fact was the family dog on the TV show ""The Brady Bunch.""Vic and Blood share a special bond, and the two communicate telepathically.Don't laugh at that last remark; it's done very well in the film.An element that could have ruined the film if not done carefully is, however, handled perfectly. Although it was suggested that animation be used to make it appear as if the dog's mouth is moving, thankfully none was used, and Tiger's masterful ""acting"", combined with the scruffy, gravelly, world-weary, old-west ""voice"" provided by Tim McIntire makes for some of the best acting in the film, and some of the best lines. Blood literally sniffs out women for Vic to have sex with, helps Vic be on the lookout for other packs of scavengers trying to kill him and each other in the ongoing fight over food and women, and Vic does the shooting, and the foraging for food. In addition the two are best friends, with Blood being the most intelligent by far. It seems that in the future, people have become the real animals.The elements of caustically dark humor and dry dialogue (the dog gets the best lines) helps carry the film. And while this is in no way ""the best Science Fiction movie ever made"", in my opinion, it's certainly a great one, along with others of its time such as ""Soylent Green"". There are practically no special effects; the scenery and sets are cheap and minimalist, letting the characters and script tell the story, for the most part. This isn't a happy-happy-joy-joy overly-laden with special effects film like many of the ones made these days.In case this whole scenario seems reminiscent of another film, ""Mad Max"", it's true that ""A Boy And His Dog"" inspired ""Mad Max"". I myself find this film to be superior, even if, and maybe in spite of, the fact that it is far less politically correct.WARNING:  SPOILER FOLLOWS!When Vic conveniently meets a young (and suspiciously clean and friendly) woman named Quilla June (portrayed by Susanne Benton), she pulls him in and the lure of frequent sex with her blinds him to Blood's warnings. So when Quilla June disappears Vic follows her to her underground community of Topeka, where he finds a warped reality of futuristic country living, combined with creepy clown makeup and aw-shucks country clothing. Its trio of self-anointed rulers is called The Committee, (this is where Jason Robards comes in), and they have a plan in mind for the young, able-bodied Vic. This all makes for a riveting scenario that's part ""Stepford Wives"", part ""Hee-Haw"", and more than a pinch of ""The Twilight Zone"". Beyond this, I will say no more except that the ending of the film is one of the best parts of the entire movie.",4,A one-of-a-kind cult classic,1114387200,"04 25, 2005",2005,4109,"['Boy', 'Dog', 'definately', 'cult', 'classic', 'defies', 'being', 'more', 'neatly', 'categorized', 'genre', 'been', 'labeled', 'alternately', 'collectively', 'being', 'misogynistic', 'greatest', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'black', 'comedy', 'cross', 'George', 'Orwell', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'last', 'description', 'personal', 'favorite', 'list', 'few', 'true', 'film', 'rather', 'misogynistic', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'fault', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'portraying', 'terrible', 'possible', 'future', 'reality', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'nice', 'folks', 'Boy', 'Dog', 'was', 'directed', 'L.Q', 'Jones', 'character', 'bit', 'actor', 'favored', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'westerns', 'based', 'novella', 'same', 'name', 'Sci-Fi', 'legend', 'Harlan', 'Ellison', 'who', 'accounts', 'loved', 'film', 'version', 'place', 'year', '2024', 'WWIV', 'ravaged', 'earth', 'civilization', 'rendering', 'post-apocalyptic', 'desert', 'where', 'humans', 'have', 'become', 'complete', 'scavengers', 'very', 'young', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'way', 'days', 'TV', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'Vic', 'young', 'solo', 'loners', 'are', 'called', 'trying', 'stay', 'alive', 'post-atomic', 'desert', 'world', 'Veteran', 'actor', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'small', 'part', 'favor', 'Jones', 'Vic', 'companion', 'friend', 'mentor', 'sheepdog', 'named', 'Blood', 'dog', 'named', 'Tiger', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'very', 'popular', 'animal', 'actor', 'times', 'extremely', 'well-trained', 'appealing', 'performer', 'fact', 'was', 'family', 'dog', 'TV', 'show', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'Vic', 'Blood', 'share', 'special', 'bond', 'two', 'communicate', 'telepathically.Do', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'last', 'remark', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'film.An', 'element', 'could', 'have', 'ruined', 'film', 'not', 'done', 'carefully', 'however', 'handled', 'perfectly', 'was', 'suggested', 'animation', 'be', 'used', 'make', 'appear', 'dog', 'mouth', 'moving', 'thankfully', 'none', 'was', 'used', 'Tiger', 'masterful', 'acting', 'combined', 'scruffy', 'gravelly', 'world-weary', 'old-west', 'voice', 'provided', 'Tim', 'McIntire', 'best', 'acting', 'film', 'best', 'lines', 'Blood', 'literally', 'out', 'women', 'Vic', 'have', 'sex', 'Vic', 'be', 'lookout', 'other', 'packs', 'scavengers', 'trying', 'kill', 'other', 'ongoing', 'fight', 'food', 'women', 'Vic', 'shooting', 'foraging', 'food', 'addition', 'two', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'Blood', 'being', 'most', 'intelligent', 'far', 'future', 'people', 'have', 'become', 'real', 'animals.The', 'elements', 'caustically', 'dark', 'humor', 'dry', 'dialogue', 'dog', 'best', 'lines', 'carry', 'film', 'way', 'best', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'opinion', 'certainly', 'great', 'one', 'others', 'time', 'such', 'Soylent', 'Green', 'are', 'practically', 'special', 'effects', 'scenery', 'sets', 'are', 'cheap', 'minimalist', 'letting', 'characters', 'script', 'tell', 'story', 'most', 'part', ""n't"", 'happy-happy-joy-joy', 'overly-laden', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'many', 'ones', 'made', 'days.In', 'case', 'whole', 'scenario', 'reminiscent', 'film', 'Mad', 'Max', 'true', 'A', 'Boy', 'Dog', 'inspired', 'Mad', 'Max', 'find', 'film', 'be', 'superior', 'even', 'maybe', 'spite', 'fact', 'far', 'less', 'politically', 'correct.WARNING', 'SPOILER', 'FOLLOWS', 'When', 'Vic', 'conveniently', 'young', 'suspiciously', 'clean', 'friendly', 'woman', 'named', 'Quilla', 'June', 'portrayed', 'Susanne', 'Benton', 'lure', 'frequent', 'sex', 'blinds', 'Blood', 'warnings', 'So', 'when', 'Quilla', 'June', 'Vic', 'underground', 'community', 'Topeka', 'where', 'warped', 'reality', 'futuristic', 'country', 'living', 'combined', 'creepy', 'clown', 'makeup', 'aw-shucks', 'country', 'clothing', 'trio', 'self-anointed', 'rulers', 'called', 'Committee', 'where', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'have', 'plan', 'mind', 'young', 'able-bodied', 'Vic', 'riveting', 'scenario', 'part', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'part', 'Hee-Haw', 'more', 'pinch', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'will', 'say', 'no', 'more', 'ending', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'parts', 'entire', 'movie']",A Boy & His Dog VHS

378181,A3G0TESLQF4HFK,6303507565,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[1, 1]","Since its release in 1975, L.Q. Jones' A Boy and His Dog has become one of the quintessential midnight movies. This faithful adaptation of Harlan Ellison's novel by the same name presents a dark post-apocalyptic world inhabited by barbarians above ground and a Stepford-like totalitarian society below. Our hero Vic (Don Johnson in an early staring role) and his telepathic dog must wind their way through various adventures as they struggle to survive. A Boy and His Dog was an instant cult classic and the direct inspiration for George Miller's Road Warrior series.This is a unique film that has stood the test of time and achieved the rank of classic. In his commentary track director L.Q Jones says that the movie played continuously for 14 years. I remember seeing it on its second reissue one midnight in 1982. The film is a testament to independant filmaking and distribution.The disc that I screened presented a letterboxed wide screen presentation with decent picture quality. The Letterboxed transfer of A BOY AND HIS DOG is an absolute necessity for one's enjoyment of this film. Without the Letterboxing, its a complete waste of time. The transfer was supervised by both the film's director L.Q. Jones and cinematographer John Morrill. The colors look very good and the image is nicely detailed. The film element used for the transfer has a number of markings scattered throughout, but none become too bothersome. Digital artifacts were virtually absent from this DVD.

If someone were to ask ""Have you ever seen A Boy And His Dog?"", what image would come to your mind? You imagine a little boy playing with his faithful dog, right?Well, whether you would or not, that was definitely me. All I heard about this movie was that it was set during a time when the Earth was ravaged and that the movie was about a hungry/horny boy with his faithful dog who complains about his libido all the time.What came to my mind was an image of a 13-14 year old boy and a dog wandering around the desert looking for something to do. Of course, if I had known this movie got an ""R"" rating, a more accurate image would have come to my head.I was very surprised by this movie. Aside from the fact that the movie shows pornography and rape, it also portrayed the main character as some kind of a sex addict. Since I had originally thought the movie had a ""PG"" rating, I didn't even think it had any of these.I found myself stumbling upon a very strange movie, indeed. You could clearly see that this is from a non-PC time because aside from the fact that it shows women as sex objects, it also shows the main character choosing his dog over a woman that claims ""she loves him"". Now, aside from that, he does something that women today would consider VERY sexist. I thought it was cool as hell, but hey, that's me.Anyway, a number of things got me confused about this movie. Now, of course there would be very little people, but why are there so much less women? Did the men have some sort of gene that allowed them to survive nuclear war better? Aside from that, why did they kill women so frivolously if women were in short supply? None of it seems to make any sense to me. The thing that really hit me, though, was the lack of commitment in EVERYONE. Considering the human race seemed to be on the verge of extinction if something wasn't done fast, why were so little committed to having children? Food didn't seem to be a factor since one scene showed them giving away food in order to see a pornography movie. Was wondering the desert with your pals digging up old cans of food so much fun that you didn't want to bother having children to make sure your species don't go extinct?Of course, that is just the gist of it. There seems to be A LOT of unexplained or unplausible stuff in this movie, but then again, you're probably not watching this movie for the plausibility.Despite the strangeness, I actually like this movie. It was fun seeing the teen kid argue with his dog about women. It certainly was touching to see how loyal they are to each other. How many guys today would give up a woman for their dog? Even if the woman was a conniving wench and the dog was loyal beyoung belief? Not many, I bet.Overall, I consider this movie to be excellent! Pick it up if you can.

I'm fairly certain my roommates thought the movie quite odd, but I was captivated by it. So much so that I ended up watching it again in my room several days later and eventually gave in and purchased the dvd.A Boy & His Dog could be considered boring to some, laughable to others, and possibly even downright sexist to a good few. There is something unique about this film that seems to capture a great many and turn the rest off completely - I'm not sure exactly what that is.Simply put, the story revolves around a young man (Vic) and his telepathic dog (Blood) as they scavenge the wasteland post-apocalypse in search of food, women, and more or less, excitement. It is definitely slow moving compared to today's fast paced action-oriented doomsday movies, but I believe that is one of the reasons I enjoyed it as much as I did. It was different than the rest. I didn't feel rushed through the story, but instead felt comfortable with the pace.

378195,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,6303507565,D. Hartley,"[7, 10]","This pre-""Mad Max"" low budget sci-fi, based on a novella by Harlan Ellison, has gathered quite a devoted cult following over the years, in addition to spawning a (by now overworked) movie subgenre. A youthful Don Johnson wanders a post-nuclear outback, chock-a-block with the requisite mutants and ruffians, ever on the prowl for food and sex. Oh, did I mention ""the dog""? The voice-over work by actor Tim McIntire, ostensibly ""as the dog"", steals the movie at every turn and undoubtedly cemented the film's cult status (it certainly wasn't Johnson's rather workmanlike performance). By turns annoyingly amateurish and brilliantly inspired, the film ultimately generates a certain kinky charm-in a guilty pleasure, pre-P.C. era kind of a way (Johnson's glorified serial rapist undoubtedly earns the film few feminist admirers). It's a ""love it or hate it"" scenario, and those already devoted will not be swayed.

378196,A2IYTNAMLR5TJR,6303507565,Don McGregor,"[2, 4]","A Boy, A Dog, A Woman -- and L.Q. Jones and Harlan Ellison: A Writer's Wounds 40 Years LaterI liked Blood.I liked Blood right up to the end.I liked Blood until Blood, the telepathic dog, the sardonic sage, laughed callously at the death of a woman, until Blood dismissively made a cruel joke out her and then laughed until fade-out.Shout! Factory has released the 1975 cult film A Boy and His Dog, on Blu-ray, directed by L. Q. Jones, who also adapted the literate and multi-faceted Harlan Ellison's award winning novella for the screenplay.This film about a post-apocalyptic Earth, set in the first half of the film in barren desert landscapes, bleached of color, bleached of life, probably set the tone for many later films depicting the aftermath of nuclear war, including the Mad Max films, before Mel Gibson revealed maybe he wasn't just acting nutso crazy mad.L. Q. Jones is adept at capturing the desert landscapes, and this Blu-ray showcases the natural lighting of the cinematography.The second half of the film is set within a brightly lit world of artifice, a world of conformity and rigid rules and grotesque cosmetic and fashion trends. L. Q. Jones is less capable of capturing this world, although he neatly handles one of the key sequences underscoring the recurrent theme of sexuality in the film, capturing it and making it clear what is going on in a fashion that certainly wasn't common-place in the mid-'70s in pop culture.I know. I was there. And believe me, violence was never the problem when writing comics.Sex was the problem. It was sexuality that would come under attack by those who would determine what you could get to see...and not see. I often suspected that those editorial censors were like ""family value"" politicians. It's okay for them. Not for you.Shout's Blu-ray of A Boy and His Dog is invaluable to writers (and to those who want the history, the background of what shapes and influences the movie they have known for years).What I find most interesting and emotionally raw is the 40 minute video interview on the Blu-ray of Harlan Ellison, the creator of the story, of this novella he has loved and had turned into a film, and L. Q. Jones.I've written much more on this in my Riding Shotgun column up on ComicsBulletin.com, complete with video of Harlan speaking at a convention, and even the trailer.Hope those of you who are interested in the BluRay have found this of some value.Don",5,"A Boy, A Dog, A Woman -- and L.Q.

378200,A2BPDFR58H9575,6303507565,Galina,"[4, 6]","*** This comment may contain spoilers ***""A Boy and His Dog"" (1975) is based on a well-known novella by Harlan Ellison of the same title.  The movie focuses of the adventures of a young scavenger Vic (Don Johnson) and his telepathic dog Blood as they wander through the  wasteland where Phoenix, Arizona used to be in 2024 AD after the end of WWIV that resulted in nuclear holocaust. In their duet, Blood seems more intelligent, experienced, sarcastic, and reasonable than Vic but they need each other to survive, to find food for both and the girls for Vic.  All females have moved underground where a parody on pre-war suburban middle class life has been preserved and it has been over six weeks since Vic got laid last. Blood will sense a girl who dressed like a boy to attend the screening of an old porn-movie and Vic will follow her as far as the underground city ""Topeka"" against the Blood's advices. Little he knew that Quilla June was supposed to lure him down under where he will be used as a source for sperm that the underground women desperately need to get pregnant. After series of adventures, Vic was able to break away from the scary looking machine he was hooked up to with Quilla June's help and two of them escape to the surface...While technically, the movie is not the most spectacular or visually prominent, the acting of the main characters, the communication between a boy (good performance from young and very  handsome Don Johnson) and his dog (Tim McIntire was very convincing providing the voice of ""Blood"" and singing the main title song, ""A Boy and His Dog""), and especially the story, dark and funny, make it well deserving of its cult status.I wanted to see the movie because I am very impressed by Ellison's writings and consider some of his short stories the best, the most brilliant, incredible, shocking, and  disturbing  ever written.  The first one I read literally took my breath away. It was ""The whimper of the whipped dogs"" that I found in the thick volume ""The Best American Mystery Stories of the Century"" and it was the brightest star among the works of such writers as O'Henry, John Steinbeck, William Faulkner, Patricia Highsmith, Joyce Carol Oates, and many more. Since my first encounter with Ellison's writing, I became his loyal fan. Later, I read Ellison's collection ""Deathbird Stories: A Pantheon Of Modern Gods"" which ""The whimper of the whipped dogs"" opens. While reading the story that gave the book its title, ""The Deathbird"", I first learned about ""A Boy and His Dog"":""Yesterday my dog died. For eleven years Ahbhu was my closest friend. He was responsible for my writing a story about a boy and his dog that many people have read. He was not a pet, he was a person. It was impossible to anthropomorphize him, he would not stand for it. But he was so much his own kind of creature, he had such a strongly formed personality, he was so determined to share his life with only those he chose, that it was impossible to think of him as simply a dog.""-Harlan Ellison ""Ahbhu"", the short story inserted in ""The Deathbird""After having read ""The Deathbird"", I was not surprised with the ending of ""A Boy and A Dog"", the story and the movie. Even though, they are attributed to the genre of science-fiction satire (and they are, intelligent, sharp, sarcastic, and biting), I think of them more as the  meditation on many important subjects and the tribute Ellison paid to the true friendship, loyalty, and love. He also  could've brought to the story resentment and disappointments from his broken marriages and relationships.",4,"""He was not a pet, he was a person""",1182816000,"06 26, 2007",2007,3576,"['***', 'comment', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***', 'A', 'Boy', 'Dog', '1975', 'based', 'well-known', 'novella', 'Harlan', 'Ellison', 'same', 'title', 'movie', 'adventures', 'young', 'scavenger', 'Vic', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'telepathic', 'dog', 'Blood', 'wander', 'wasteland', 'where', 'Phoenix', 'Arizona', 'used', 'be', '2024', 'AD', 'end', 'WWIV', 'resulted', 'nuclear', 'holocaust', 'duet', 'Blood', 'more', 'intelligent', 'experienced', 'sarcastic', 'reasonable', 'Vic', 'need', 'other', 'survive', 'find', 'food', 'girls', 'Vic', 'females', 'have', 'moved', 'underground', 'where', 'parody', 'pre-war', 'suburban', 'middle', 'class', 'life', 'been', 'preserved', 'been', 'six', 'weeks', 'Vic', 'got', 'laid', 'last', 'Blood', 'will', 'sense', 'girl', 'who', 'dressed', 'boy', 'attend', 'screening', 'old', 'porn-movie', 'Vic', 'will', 'follow', 'as', 'far', 'underground', 'city', 'Topeka', 'Blood', 'advices', 'Little', 'knew', 'Quilla', 'June', 'was', 'supposed', 'lure', 'down', 'where', 'will', 'be', 'used', 'source', 'sperm', 'underground', 'women', 'desperately', 'need', 'get', 'pregnant', 'series', 'adventures', 'Vic', 'was', 'able', 'break', 'away', 'scary', 'looking', 'machine', 'was', 'hooked', 'up', 'Quilla', 'June', 'help', 'two', 'escape', 'surface', 'technically', 'movie', 'not', 'most', 'spectacular', 'visually', 'prominent', 'acting', 'main', 'characters', 'communication', 'boy', 'good', 'performance', 'young', 'very', 'handsome', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'dog', 'Tim', 'McIntire', 'was', 'very', 'convincing', 'providing', 'voice', 'Blood', 'singing', 'main', 'title', 'song', 'Boy', 'Dog', 'especially', 'story', 'dark', 'funny', 'make', 'well', 'deserving', 'cult', 'status.I', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'am', 'very', 'impressed', 'Ellison', 'writings', 'consider', 'short', 'stories', 'best', 'most', 'brilliant', 'incredible', 'shocking', 'disturbing', 'ever', 'written', 'first', 'one', 'read', 'literally', 'took', 'breath', 'away', 'was', 'whimper', 'whipped', 'dogs', 'found', 'thick', 'volume', 'Best', 'American', 'Mystery', 'Stories', 'Century', 'was', 'brightest', 'star', 'works', 'such', 'writers', ""O'Henry"", 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'William', 'Faulkner', 'Patricia', 'Highsmith', 'Joyce', 'Carol', 'Oates', 'many', 'more', 'first', 'encounter', 'Ellison', 'writing', 'became', 'loyal', 'fan', 'Later', 'read', 'Ellison', 'collection', 'Deathbird', 'Stories', 'Pantheon', 'Modern', 'Gods', 'whimper', 'whipped', 'dogs', 'opens', 'reading', 'story', 'gave', 'book', 'title', 'Deathbird', 'first', 'learned', 'A', 'Boy', 'Dog', 'Yesterday', 'dog', 'died', 'eleven', 'years', 'Ahbhu', 'was', 'closest', 'friend', 'was', 'responsible', 'writing', 'story', 'boy', 'dog', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'read', 'was', 'not', 'pet', 'was', 'person', 'was', 'impossible', 'anthropomorphize', 'would', 'not', 'stand', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'own', 'kind', 'creature', 'had', 'strongly', 'formed', 'personality', 'was', 'so', 'determined', 'share', 'life', 'only', 'chose', 'was', 'impossible', 'think', 'simply', 'dog', '-Harlan', 'Ellison', 'Ahbhu', 'short', 'story', 'inserted', 'Deathbird', 'having', 'read', 'Deathbird', 'was', 'not', 'surprised', 'ending', 'A', 'Boy', 'A', 'Dog', 'story', 'movie', 'Even', 'are', 'attributed', 'genre', 'science-fiction', 'satire', 'are', 'intelligent', 'sharp', 'sarcastic', 'biting', 'think', 'more', 'meditation', 'many', 'important', 'subjects', 'tribute', 'Ellison', 'paid', 'true', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'love', 'also', 'could', ""'ve"", 'brought', 'story', 'resentment', 'disappointments', 'broken', 'marriages', 'relationships']",A Boy & His Dog VHS

I've noticed in my screenings of this film for friends, that women tend to dislike the film very much.  This could have a lot to do with the ending, which despite what a previous reviewer has said, is quite unambiguous and easy to understand (my 61-year-old mother got it, and actually liked the film).  The ending, which is a bit shocking at first, simply fails to fully evoke Ellison's original, more subtle approach.Harlan Ellison, a man not easily pleased by adaptations (especially of this story, arguably his most personal--at least at the time), has said he really likes this film, but the last line bugs the heck out of him.

S. of A.). As in all of Don Johnson's earliest films (his more frequently buttocks- and bollocks-baring ""The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart"" and ""The Harrad Experiment"", especially), this actor, in appearance and personality, was winsomely, alluringly cute, and enticingly sensuous in bearing. Johnson's occasional nudity, or, more frequently, his near- or partial-nakedness in this film, amply show off such elegantly youthful assets, as then usual in his burgeoning cinematic career. Johnson's spunky manner was delightfully insouciant and irresistably, potently sexy. He really has been the main reason, over the years, for continuing to want to see and to treasure this peculiar movie.The film gets rather grim at some points, but the surrealism of it all makes the viewer laugh as well as squirm a bit. Don Johnson did not flinch at anything that his scripts might demand at this early stage of his life in film; it helped that one of his assets was being so naturally exhibitionistic and playful by nature, revelling in his own boyish beauty and lithe atheleticism.As for young Vic's canine companion and tutor, named Blood, whose pet-human, hunting boy, and pupil Vic happens to be, that wily and domineering animal is shaggy and, not surprisingly, his dawggy lips don't move with his dialogue.

378204,A34FSS6DNL1UJ,6303507565,"""iriley1979""","[0, 0]","This movie is very well done despite the low budget, it has a good script, supurb acting, good direction, and a sick and twisted suprise ending that is one of the best in movie history. Obvioulsy women do not like the ending, (maybe because they know deep down the main character made the smart choice?) but let us remember who that female character was and what she did. She was a manipulative liar who was just out to use Don Johnson's character for her own purposes. She was out for herself and he could not trust her. Still the ending was really, really sick but then again so was the whole movie. Dark humor and piercing insight combine to create a dystopian underground world that reveals the true character of the American government in the future, in the past, and in the present. One revewier characterized this sophistacted and clever satire of American culture, politics, and self image as a ""naive leftest world view."" Sorry pal, you are the one who is naive, rather you like it or not this moive exposed our government for what it is, a tyranny run by fascist bullies. Not that any  other government on this planet is really any different, some are just worse than others. This movie gives its main character two choices, life in a desert wasteland surrounded by roaming tribes of savages, or life underground enslaved by the rements of the old regime who enforce their will through androids. The Telepathic dog is by far the best character in the movie and has the best lines, vainly trying to give Don Johnson's character history lessons. This movie paints an exagerated but bascially accurate potrait of the world we live in, people are either dominated by fascist regimes that exploit their citizens, or live in wild, chaotic, untamed areas where different tribes or groups steal from and kill each other. Either slavery or an extreemly dangerous freedom are the choices the chacters in this movie are presented with, and it is that really so different from the world we live in? We are either corporate slaves or outlaws, one or the other. Some people might call these a simplistic world view but they would be wrong and I would be right. In this movie Don Johnson can trust no one but his dog, is that so different from real life? This movie is clever and disturbing, thought provoking and interesting.

After food and water, what is next on the list of ""necessities"" for a lonely survivalist?  Well, if you're Vic (Don Johnson), the obvious answer is sex.  Lucky for him he has a telepathic link with a pet dog named Blood who is willing to traverse the desert landscape and sniff out the feminine scent.Despite the dire situation, A Boy & His Dog plays out as more of a dark comedy than anything else.  The constant sarcastic exchanges between a dense human and genius dog - voiced dryly and hilariously by Tim McIntire - carry the movie from beginning to end, and through a few slow moments on the hunt for women.  When Vic and Blood encounter nomadic villains and scheming seductresses, the action or plot advance only as far as dialogue can carry.  Johnson acts nearly solo the entire movie, and does so admirably, but Jason Robards provides a reserved performance as the ruler of a warped subterranean society.Somehow this movie about a serial rapist and his mutant dog is charming, even if the charm isn't expected - which is why it's often referred to as a cult classic.  There are definitely filming and transfer issues, but neither dates or distracts.  Ultimately the movie is just an odd perspective of dystopian future that paved the way for films like Road Warrior and Postman.  Stick around until the ending, when Blood utters one of the funniest closing comments in movie history (sums up the movie perfectly).Jason Elin",4,"Watch it if you have good ""taste""",1285459200,"09 26, 2010",2010,1515,"['Years', 'WW4', 'decimated', 'earth', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'post-apocalyptic', 'wasteland', 'food', 'water', 'what', 'next', 'list', 'necessities', 'lonely', 'survivalist', 'Well', ""'re"", 'Vic', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'obvious', 'answer', 'sex', 'Lucky', 'telepathic', 'link', 'pet', 'dog', 'named', 'Blood', 'who', 'willing', 'traverse', 'desert', 'landscape', 'sniff', 'feminine', 'dire', 'situation', 'A', 'Boy', 'Dog', 'out', 'more', 'dark', 'comedy', 'anything', 'else', 'constant', 'sarcastic', 'exchanges', 'dense', 'human', 'genius', 'dog', 'voiced', 'dryly', 'hilariously', 'Tim', 'McIntire', 'carry', 'movie', 'beginning', 'end', 'few', 'slow', 'moments', 'hunt', 'women', 'When', 'Vic', 'Blood', 'encounter', 'nomadic', 'villains', 'scheming', 'seductresses', 'action', 'plot', 'advance', 'only', 'as', 'far', 'dialogue', 'can', 'carry', 'Johnson', 'nearly', 'solo', 'entire', 'movie', 'so', 'admirably', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'reserved', 'performance', 'ruler', 'warped', 'subterranean', 'society.Somehow', 'movie', 'serial', 'rapist', 'mutant', 'dog', 'charming', 'even', 'charm', ""n't"", 'expected', 'why', 'often', 'referred', 'cult', 'classic', 'are', 'definitely', 'filming', 'transfer', 'issues', 'dates', 'distracts', 'Ultimately', 'movie', 'just', 'odd', 'perspective', 'dystopian', 'future', 'paved', 'way', 'films', 'Road', 'Warrior', 'Postman', 'Stick', 'ending', 'when', 'Blood', 'one', 'funniest', 'closing', 'comments', 'movie', 'history', 'sums', 'up', 'movie', 'perfectly', '.Jason', 'Elin']",A Boy & His Dog VHS

378208,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,6303507565,Jeffrey Leach,"[4, 5]","In the annals of low budget, post apocalyptic science fiction, you would be hard pressed to find a film stranger than director L.Q. Jones's cinematic adaptation of Harlan Ellison's ""A Boy and His Dog."" Here is a film that fairly screams cult classic despite its rather unexceptional backstory. In the year 2024 (or thereabouts), humanity teeters on the brink of ultimate destruction. Not one but two nuclear conflagrations have reduced most of the planet's denizens to scruffy, underfed ruffians. Why did the wars in this movie occur? Who knows? During the Cold War we all expected a nuclear exchange to break out any day over any number of reasons. Perhaps the Soviet Union would invade Western Europe. Maybe the United States and Russia would exchange volleys seeking control of Persian Gulf oil. Even a spark in a third world nation presented humanity with the threat of utter annihilation back in those days. One could argue that the nuclear threat hasn't gone away today since both the United States and Russia still possess arsenals. Even worse, proliferation means other countries with far less self-control already have or will soon have the bomb. Whatever the reasons for nuclear war, they are far less important in this film than life afterwards.Vic (Don Johnson) roams the blasted plains of post-apocalyptic America with his trusty pooch Blood. Interestingly and weirdly enough, the two are able to communicate through a psychic link obviously brought about by too much exposure to radiation. Boy and dog spend all of their time looking for food, a challenge in a world where supermarkets tend to lie under tons of atomically fused soil and where one must battle roving packs of pirates for a can or two of preserved fruit. More important than procuring food is Vic's desire for locating women, any women but good-looking ones are better, in order to fulfill age old desires. It is this food/female combination that forms the central tenet of Vic's relationship with Blood and vice versa. The dog can quite literally sense the presence of women in the area, much to Vic's delight, but Blood insists on food before disclosing the location of the female in question. Blood's demands frequently result in flaring tempers, heated exchanges, and elaborate negotiations, but both eventually get what they want and, more importantly, possess an extreme loyalty to one another when the chips are down. A good example comes when weird shrieking creatures arrive on the scene and Blood helps Vic escape from them as well as from a band of hostile men. It's good to have such a loyal companion in this post-apocalyptic world.Sadly, it takes a strange series of events for Vic to learn how important Blood is to his well being. Predictably, the trouble starts with a woman, a very attractive woman by the name of Quilla June Holmes (Susanne Benton). After Blood sniffs her out for his buddy Vic, Holmes lures our young hero into what can only be described as a dystopia that would give George Orwell nightmares. It appears Vic has a very special trait highly sought after by Topeka, an underground society led by Lou Craddock (Jason Robards) and a couple of other people, and that trait is fertility. Vic's vital fluids will help this community repopulate itself, but the whole thing isn't as much fun as it sounds. First, these people are weird on a metaphysical level. The whole community strives to reproduce a vision of America, but it looks like they culled their ideas about the pre-war United States from books written in the 1950s. Marching bands and picnics form the crux of the society's activities, and people wear attire that makes them look like parodies of American regional types. Second, these people look bizarre and act in strange ways. Craddock, along with the rest of the citizens, wears this hideous white pancake makeup that is truly frightening. Loudspeakers blare a constant litany of recipes and other news announcements. Yikes.The conclusion to the film is downbeat yet fits perfectly with the off the wall antics of the preceding ninety minutes. And everything about ""A Boy and His Dog"" is off the wall. You want to see a pack of pirates digging for food in the desert? A bunch of folks watching a blue movie out in the middle of nowhere? Here's your film. This is such a strange jaunt into the realms of the odd that the idea of a human communicating with a dog seems perfectly normal. Speaking of Blood, it's the same dog that played Tiger in the Brady Bunch. The person voicing this animal is a real hoot, what with the off color limericks and world weary sarcasm that dominates his discussions with Vic. For his part Don Johnson does remarkably well in a role that requires him to act opposite an animal in a believable way. It is Jason Robards, however, who steals every scene he is in as the tyrannical Lou Craddock. Everyone knows this actor was a real talent, but it's nice to see him take on such an offbeat role. I always like an actor or actress who steps outside the conventional, and Robards definitely does that here.Extras on the disc aren't plentiful. There's a trailer, of course, that tries to play up the controversial elements of the film. The real treat is the commentary with L.Q. Jones; he discusses every element of the movie from the low budget to working with Robards. One intriguing anecdote involves the scene where Craddock eats the sandwich while talking with his associates. Jones relates with great glee how the sandwich was rotten yet Robards refused to interrupt the scene in any way to voice his displeasure. That's professionalism carried to the nth degree, wouldn't you say? ""A Boy and His Dog"" might not appeal to many viewers, but it's definitely worth watching for the cult film fan.",5,"Bizarre, blackly comedic, fun",1108857600,"02 20, 2005",2005,5749,"['annals',

378218,A2BDJOIXPR2AYU,6303507565,King of Controversy,"[0, 2]","Portions of the movie take place at night or indoors and it's a bit too dark. At times the musical score and the sound effects are perfect and at times they are a major distraction. The script is really brought to life though. It's a very good adaptation of the story. It concerns a boy, Vic, and his intelligent K-9 traveling companion, 'Blood'.  Blood the dog is actually smarter than Vic, and telepathic. The audience can hear what he says/thinks. Similar to Dean Koontz 'The Watchers', he's descended from dogs who have been genetically engineered for war.Vic used to be in a gang but now he's a solo 'rover'. Vic and Blood, the dog, travel across a post-apocalypse landscape in search of food, sex, and what good times they can find. In the middle of the movie, honest to goodness, there's a scene where it's apparent there's a love triangle between Vic, Blood, and a human female they come across. The girl in question is Quilla June, a young girl from an underground shelter who's been sent above ground to lure one of the young solos underground. Quilla June ends up knocking Vic out but 'accidentally' leaving behind her ID card/gate pass. Vic feels compelled to stalk her, and follow her into the down under, presumably to get back whatever he feels she took from him, or from his well-developed sense of entitlement.Jokes aside, it's as if the movie makers took care to make this movie PETA approved. It's not so kind to human females. When the movie begins a gang rapes and kills a young woman. When Vic, the protagonist, gets there, kind of like a scavenger, he's only sorry they killed her, ""She could have been used one or two more times"" he laments. It's a wonder there are so many girls around (at least Vic spends a bit of his time trying to find his next lay). From there Vic and Blood attend an old beat up movie theater (which will figure later in the review) and watch old films with the gangs.In the above ground world girls don't care too much for sex. In the original story Vic remembers raping a girl screaming all the while saying she'd get him. Afterwards he ""tied her up just to be sure"". In the underground world, the girls want sex. There the men are sterile, though presumably still able to do it. One reviewer saying (and I did not notice it myself) this is one of the messages of the movie, repressing men leads to them being sterile.It's almost like two movies in one. In the second half Vic leaves Blood behind and travels underground to a city critic Roger Ebert called ""a truly horrible place that looks like a cross between a Norman Rockwell small town and a circus sideshow.""The underground community has loudspeakers constantly blaring out relationship advice and recipe tips to the public. For me it tied the movie together a bit in that it reminded me of the voice over of Blood the dog giving out advice earlier in the movie. I have to admit here, If I were the boss, or owned my own island or something, this is the style of propaganda that would appear in the 'free press'.It is a scary view of 50's America though run by 3 members of 'the committee' (three committee members who feel no compunction to follow the helpful advice given out by the loudspeaker for sure) backed up by the muscle of a single robot/android enforcer, Michael. After being written up three times for 'transgressions', citizens (whole families) are sent, ""off to the farm"" a euphemism for being killed by the robot. ""Write down they both had heart attacks"" a committee member says after disposing a case.Vic manages to escape the underground where he's been caught by Michael the robot and forced to be their sperm donor (since they are infertile that's why they are holding him). Quilla June, who has a change of heart, steals Vic's guns back for him helping him escape. After about 30 rounds of ammunition Vic puts their robot out of commission. This is the point in the original story where it becomes obvious it has an agenda. As they make their escape, shooting at the last townsfolk chasing them, Vic says to himself, ""they should have known better than to mess with Jimmy Cagney."" Cagney being the actor who always plays the gangster in the movies he loves to watch. Then of course right after their escape, there's the twist ending.This is the most conservative work of fiction I've ever read, ever. Perhaps the filmmaker failed to convey this but I think the failure is more on the part of the viewer. Do we have an underlying fear of seeing things in an incorrect way? The original story was written in 1968. Is it difficult for us to empathize with a world view so different from the one we're ordinarily presented with?Perhaps, though, it's just an ode to freedom, or a dark comedy where everything in existence is evil and self serving.Or perhaps it's simply a well-needed critique of conservative America.We're often told about the atrocities of the Nazi's. Or even of the evils of communism (although this isn't taken as seriously, hardly seriously, even when it's documented as in the case of the Khmer Rouge, when millions immigrated to America - oops were exterminated). Let's just hope next time the reader er the ringleaders will be publicly brought to justice.

Johnson (in an excellent performance) is Vic, a simple-minded survivalist  who wanders what's left of post-apocalypse America with his dog Blood  (played by Tiger of &quot;The Brady Bunch,&quot; with voice by singer Tim  McIntire), with whom he has a telepathic bond.

The ""boy"" (Don Johnson) is able to communicate telepathically with his dog as they try to survive. Eventually they go underground to find a secret society. Our hero is used for devious purposes before the society seeks to get rid of him. It is based on a novella by Harlan Ellison. This 2-disc Blu-Ray/DVD release has never looked or sounded better. The new remastering is a huge improvement over the prior DVD versions but dirt, scratches, and defects remain in the print. The audio mix is mono (both DTS-HD and Dolby Digital). You are getting almost an hour of NEW bonus content and a director's commentary (from the DVD). Both are excellent and fans will appreciate them. ""In Conversation"" isn't a fluff piece because Jones and Ellison go at it. It all seems to go back to the screenplay which was started by the legendary Ellison (who also wrote the novella) but finished by producer Alvy Moore and L.Q. Jones. Ellison did praise the film after its premiere but seems to be more critical now.

378226,A1MC5IOX5OPF4X,6303507565,". ""mattb123""","[1, 2]","Based on a Harlen Ellison novel, ""A Boy and his Dog"" is a cult classic that is part dark comedy, and part post-apocalypse sci-fi.  This is one movie where the more time that went by after I finished watching it the more I realized I enjoyed it.  ""AB&HD;"" is set in a post-nuclear wasteland where people wander around attempting to survive in a ""Road Warrior"" type fashion; but also where pockets of society have sprung up underground in a quasi-dystopia state.Don Johnson's character (""Vic"") wanders the surface...not as part of one of the bands of humans who've ganged up for protection...but rather Vic travels solo, with the exception of his dog who Vic can communicate with via telepathy.  The dog alternates between providing Vic helpful information, and making sarcastic quips- usually at Vic's expense (and often to Vic's consternation).  In addition to protection, one of the services Blood the dog provides is the ability to sniff out human females.  The state of the above-ground world and the ""dystopia"" society that crops up may or may not be a literal prediction of what is to come after nuclear annihilation. But then again who's to say what type of nutty cults or societies may pop up.This is one of Don Johnson's earlier movies and one can certainly see rumors of his later characters like Sonny Crockett. In addition to Don Johnson and the voice of Blood the dog played by Tim McIntyre, other fine acting performances in the movie include Susanne Benton and Jason Robards, Jr.Every viewer can decide for themselves how seriously to take this movie (but after all, it's about a talking dog...). Overall, this movie may not be for today's average movie-fan, but it's definitely enjoyable if you like cult classics and 60-80's ""B-type"" sci-fi's.  (warning- mild spoiler) As the movie progresses, no overt explanation is given as to why or how Don Johnson's character can communicate with the dog...whether Blood obtained this ability as part of the holocaust or whether there is something special about Vic, or whether Vic is just crazy and Blood's just a regular dog.  I personally think this adds to the humor that they don't bother trying to explain it..",4,The movie where once and for all we learn who is truly man's best friend!!,1273622400,"05 12, 2010",2010,2171,"['Based', 'Harlen', 'Ellison', 'novel', 'Boy', 'Dog', 'cult', 'classic', 'part', 'dark', 'comedy', 'part', 'post-apocalypse', 'sci-fi', 'one', 'movie', 'where', 'more', 'time', 'went', 'finished', 'watching', 'more', 'realized', 'enjoyed', 'AB', 'HD', 'set', 'post-nuclear', 'wasteland', 'where', 'people', 'wander', 'attempting', 'survive', 'Road', 'Warrior', 'type', 'fashion', 'also', 'where', 'pockets', 'society', 'have', 'sprung', 'up', 'underground', 'quasi-dystopia', 'state.Don', 'Johnson', 'character', 'Vic', 'surface', 'not', 'part', 'one', 'bands', 'humans', 'who', ""'ve"", 'ganged', 'up', 'protection', 'rather', 'Vic', 'travels', 'solo', 'exception', 'dog', 'who', 'Vic', 'can', 'communicate', 'telepathy', 'dog', 'providing', 'Vic', 'helpful', 'information', 'making', 'sarcastic', 'quips-', 'usually', 'Vic', 'expense', 'often', 'Vic', 'consternation', 'addition', 'protection', 'one', 'services', 'Blood', 'dog', 'ability', 'sniff', 'out', 'human', 'females', 'state', 'above-ground', 'world', 'dystopia', 'society', 'up', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'literal', 'prediction', 'what', 'come', 'nuclear', 'annihilation', 'then', 'again', 'who', 'say', 'what', 'type', 'nutty', 'cults', 'societies', 'may', 'pop', 'up.This', 'one', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'earlier', 'movies', 'one', 'can', 'certainly', 'see', 'rumors', 'later', 'characters', 'Sonny', 'Crockett', 'addition', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'voice', 'Blood', 'dog', 'played', 'Tim', 'McIntyre', 'other', 'fine', 'acting', 'performances', 'movie', 'include', 'Susanne', 'Benton', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'Jr.Every', 'viewer', 'can', 'decide', 'how', 'seriously', 'take', 'movie', 'talking', 'dog', 'Overall', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'today', 'average', 'movie-fan', 'definitely', 'enjoyable', 'like', 'cult', 'classics', '60-80', 'B-type', 'sci-fi', 'warning-', 'mild', 'spoiler', 'movie', 'overt', 'explanation', 'given', 'why', 'how', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'character', 'can', 'communicate', 'dog', 'Blood', 'obtained', 'ability', 'part', 'holocaust', 'something', 'special', 'Vic', 'Vic', 'just', 'crazy', 'Blood', 'just', 'regular', 'dog', 'personally', 'think', 'humor', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'trying', 'explain', 'it..']",A Boy & His Dog VHS
378227,A7P7ZBSC10APW,6303507565,Michael J. Covino,"[4, 5]","Typically I do reviews for games, but I noticed this copy of ""A Boy and His Dog"" had a huge lack of support compared to the other copies being sold here on Amazon. The quality of this DVD format is fairly good for being a 1970s film. Most of the scenes were shot on dark sets, yet I could see everything clearly. That can't be said for all movies from this decade. It did not look as crisp as the ""Planet of The Apes"" DVD conversion, another movie from the 70s, but then again ""Planet of the Apes"" was a Hollywood hit from the get-go. ""A Boy and His Dog"" was B-grade back then and still is today. By the way, there are no special features on this DVD and the movie can only be viewed in standard 4:3 format.As for the movie itself; it's exactly what my title says it is. The world has been decimated by Atomic bombs and humanity is stretched thin. I guess nothing can grow, because everyone scavenges for canned food left behind by the old world. Canned food is also the currency. Without it, you cannot survive or buy yourself admission into a barricaded movie theater under the stars in the middle of a vast wasteland. People will even work for canned food.Aside from hunger, other stubborn human needs never seem to die, such as sex. Women are as scarce as food, yet they are only worth having just once since keeping one for yourself would be a constant battle with other sexually deprived assailants. Dogs are used to sniff women out of hiding.Speaking of dogs, the K9 in this movie is also one of the 3 main stars. Another thing, it talks to its owner, or...at least the owner believes the dog can talk. Whether or not the owner has lost his mind from scavenging the wasteland for too long, I don't know, but their personalities are complete opposites, and they are constantly arguing with each other. The boy acts more on his emotions while the dog is more concerned with maintaining their survival and their little squabbles are pretty darn funny.Eventually, the boy becomes infatuated with this woman, and despite the protests of his dog, he follows her into an underground bomb shelter whose inhabitants have preserved somewhat the society and culture of the old world, and down there he gets himself into a whole heap of trouble. Years of surviving the world topside lent him the skills to survive the ordeal and we learn that if no one can be trusted in a world gone sour, a boy can always depend on the loyalty of his dog.",4,"Humor and friendship in a dark, gritty world",1235692800,"02 27, 2009",2009,2435,"['Typically', 'do', 'reviews', 'games', 'noticed', 'copy', 'A', 'Boy', 'Dog', 'had', 'huge', 'lack', 'support', 'compared', 'other', 'copies', 'being', 'sold', 'here', 'Amazon', 'quality', 'DVD', 'format', 'fairly', 'good', 'being', '1970s', 'film', 'Most', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'dark', 'sets', 'yet', 'could', 'see', 'everything', 'clearly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'movies', 'decade', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'as', 'crisp', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'DVD', 'conversion', 'movie', '70s', 'then', 'again', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'was', 'Hollywood', 'hit', 'get-go', 'Boy', 'Dog', 'was', 'B-grade', 'back', 'then', 'still', 'today', 'way', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'movie', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'viewed', 'standard', '4:3', 'format.As', 'movie', 'exactly', 'what', 'title', 'world', 'been', 'decimated', 'Atomic', 'bombs', 'humanity', 'stretched', 'thin', 'guess', 'nothing', 'can', 'grow', 'everyone', 'scavenges', 'canned', 'food', 'left', 'old', 'world', 'Canned', 'food', 'also', 'currency', 'can', 'not', 'survive', 'buy', 'admission', 'barricaded', 'movie', 'theater', 'stars', 'middle', 'vast', 'wasteland', 'People', 'will', 'even', 'work', 'canned', 'food.Aside', 'hunger', 'other', 'stubborn', 'human', 'never', 'seem', 'die', 'such', 'sex', 'Women', 'are', 'as', 'scarce', 'food', 'yet', 'are', 'only', 'worth', 'having', 'just', 'once', 'keeping', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'constant', 'battle', 'other', 'sexually', 'deprived', 'assailants', 'Dogs', 'are', 'used', 'sniff', 'women', 'hiding.Speaking', 'dogs', 'K9', 'movie', 'also', 'one', '3', 'main', 'stars', 'thing', 'owner', 'least', 'owner', 'dog', 'can', 'talk', 'Whether', 'not', 'owner', 'lost', 'mind', 'scavenging', 'wasteland', 'too', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'personalities', 'are', 'complete', 'opposites', 'are', 'constantly', 'arguing', 'other', 'boy', 'more', 'emotions', 'dog', 'more', 'concerned', 'maintaining', 'survival', 'little', 'squabbles', 'are', 'pretty', 'darn', 'funny.Eventually', 'boy', 'infatuated', 'woman', 'protests', 'dog', 'underground', 'bomb', 'shelter', 'inhabitants', 'have', 'preserved', 'somewhat', 'society', 'culture', 'old', 'world', 'down', 'there', 'whole', 'heap', 'trouble', 'Years', 'surviving', 'world', 'topside', 'lent', 'skills', 'survive', 'ordeal', 'learn', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'trusted', 'world', 'gone', 'sour', 'boy', 'can', 'always', 'depend', 'loyalty', 'dog']",A Boy & His Dog VHS

378229,A2M1N8G4W4END8,6303507565,Michael R Gates,"[126, 134]","It's the year 2024, and most of the Earth's nations have been demolished by yet another world war (the latest being WWIV).  In this postapocalyptic world, slow-witted survivor Vic (Don Johnson) forages through the ruins for food and women with the help of his faithful dog, Blood (voiced by Tim McIntire), with whom he is able to communicate telepathically.  Blood, more intelligent and more cultured than his young &quot;master,&quot; often gets impatient with Vic's immature behavior and lack of interest in his attempts to educate the boy, but he nonetheless loves Vic and sticks with him to help him survive. And after several minor adventures and one huge misadventure, Vic does learn one incontestable actuality: Nothing is more important to a boy than his dog.Based on an award-winning novella by the curmudgeonly SF writer Harlan Ellison, A BOY AND HIS DOG was adapted and directed by character actor L.Q. Jones and co-produced by Jones and Alvy Moore (the latter probably best known for his portrayal of scatterbrained Hank Kimball on TV's GREEN ACRES).  While Ellison has said many times publicly that the film is the most faithful adaptation of any of his works, he has nonetheless complained vehemently about some of Jones' &quot;adjustments&quot;--most notably the minor addition of some gross or vulgar dialogue--and tried unsuccessfully to get them changed.  Whether or not Ellison's complaints have merit, A BOY AND HIS DOG has come to be regarded as a science-fiction classic, its popularity undoubtedly due to its likeable characters who, despite their constant bickering and individual quirks, are redeemed by their committed friendship and their sarcastically humorous approach to survival.The performances in A BOY AND HIS DOG are top-notch.  Johnson convincingly portrays Vic as a filthy scavenger who, in spite of his dire situation, still manages to remain a decent human being at the core.  Tim McIntire's vocal characterization of Blood embodies Ellison's original concept of a mutant pooch with a caustic ego that is balanced with just the right amount of off-beat humanity, and this portrayal is enhanced further by the outstanding on-screen performance of Tiger, the canine thespian that portrayed the family pet on TV's THE BRADY BUNCH.  In his supporting role as the governor of a subterranean dystopia, Jason Robards is delightfully smarmy.  And when beautiful Susanne Benton bares her ample ""talents"" on the screen, that's a lot of fun watch, too.With A BOY AND HIS DOG, Jones' intention is not to make deep socio-political innuendos or to meet the average action-fan's prosaic expectations, and sentimentality is obviously far from his mind.  Instead of serving up a dull postapocalyptic survival-of-the-fittest thriller or a clich&eacute; love-among-the-ruins drama, Jones gives us a wry black comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously.  His direction is tight, his staging often inventive, and the dialogue--while MOSTLY lifted directly from Ellison's story--is often sharply sardonic and frequently witty.  With this AND the outstanding performances he elicits from his cast, Jones creates a realistic world of future desolation, but he peoples it with central characters that learn to deal with the nightmare while still maintaining their humanity...and a sense of humor.Several DVD editions of A BOY AND HIS DOG have been available over the past few years, and all have delivered good letterbox widescreen digital transfers.  The current offering from First Run Features is an anamorphic widescreen version, and it also contains an interesting feature commentary and theatrical trailers.All in all, A BOY AND HIS DOG is a wonderful interpretation of a classic SF novella, and this DVD will make a great entry in the film collections of SF fans who love quirky non-mainstream films.",5,Nothing Is More Important to a Boy than His Dog,1078790400,"03 9, 2004",2004,3824,"['year', '2024', 'most', 'Earth', 'nations', 'have', 'been', 'demolished', 'yet', 'world', 'war', 'latest', 'being', 'WWIV', 'postapocalyptic', 'world', 'slow-witted', 'survivor', 'Vic', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'ruins', 'food', 'women', 'help', 'faithful', 'dog', 'Blood', 'voiced', 'Tim', 'McIntire', 'whom', 'able', 'communicate', 'telepathically', 'Blood', 'more', 'intelligent', 'more', 'cultured', 'young', 'quot', 'master', 'quot', 'often', 'impatient', 'Vic', 'immature', 'behavior', 'lack', 'interest', 'attempts', 'educate', 'boy', 'nonetheless', 'Vic', 'sticks', 'help', 'survive', 'several', 'minor', 'adventures', 'one', 'huge', 'misadventure', 'Vic', 'learn', 'one', 'incontestable', 'actuality', 'Nothing', 'more', 'important', 'boy', 'dog.Based', 'award-winning', 'novella', 'curmudgeonly', 'SF', 'writer', 'Harlan', 'Ellison', 'A', 'BOY', 'AND', 'HIS', 'DOG', 'was', 'adapted', 'directed', 'character', 'actor', 'L.Q', 'Jones', 'co-produced', 'Jones', 'Alvy', 'Moore', 'latter', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'portrayal', 'scatterbrained', 'Hank', 'Kimball', 'TV', 'GREEN', 'ACRES', 'Ellison', 'said', 'many', 'times', 'publicly', 'film', 'most', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'works', 'nonetheless', 'complained', 'vehemently', 'Jones', 'quot', 'adjustments', 'quot', 'most', 'notably', 'minor', 'addition', 'gross', 'vulgar', 'dialogue', 'tried', 'unsuccessfully', 'get', 'changed', 'not', 'Ellison', 'complaints', 'have', 'merit', 'BOY', 'AND', 'HIS', 'DOG', 'come', 'be', 'regarded', 'science-fiction', 'classic', 'popularity', 'undoubtedly', 'due', 'likeable', 'characters', 'who', 'constant', 'bickering', 'individual', 'quirks', 'are', 'redeemed', 'committed', 'friendship', 'sarcastically', 'humorous', 'approach', 'survival.The', 'performances', 'A', 'BOY', 'AND', 'HIS', 'DOG', 'are', 'top-notch', 'Johnson', 'convincingly', 'Vic', 'filthy', 'scavenger', 'who', 'spite', 'dire', 'situation', 'still', 'remain', 'decent', 'human', 'being', 'core', 'Tim', 'McIntire', 'vocal', 'characterization', 'Blood', 'embodies', 'Ellison', 'original', 'concept', 'mutant', 'pooch', 'caustic', 'ego', 'balanced', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'off-beat', 'humanity', 'portrayal', 'enhanced', 'further', 'outstanding', 'on-screen', 'performance', 'Tiger', 'canine', 'thespian', 'portrayed', 'family', 'pet', 'TV', 'THE', 'BRADY', 'BUNCH', 'supporting', 'role', 'governor', 'subterranean', 'dystopia', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'delightfully', 'smarmy', 'when', 'beautiful', 'Susanne', 'Benton', 'ample', 'talents', 'screen', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'too.With', 'A', 'BOY', 'AND', 'HIS', 'DOG', 'Jones', 'intention', 'not', 'make', 'deep', 'socio-political', 'innuendos', 'meet', 'average', 'action-fan', 'prosaic', 'expectations', 'sentimentality', 'obviously', 'far', 'mind', 'Instead', 'serving', 'up', 'dull', 'postapocalyptic', 'survival-of-the-fittest', 'thriller', 'clich', 'eacute', 'love-among-the-ruins', 'drama', 'Jones', 'wry', 'black', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'direction', 'tight', 'staging', 'often', 'inventive', 'dialogue', 'MOSTLY', 'lifted', 'directly', 'Ellison', 'story', 'often', 'sharply', 'sardonic', 'frequently', 'witty', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'cast', 'Jones', 'realistic', 'world', 'future', 'desolation', 'central', 'characters', 'learn', 'deal', 'nightmare', 'still', 'maintaining', 'humanity', 'sense', 'humor.Several', 'DVD', 'editions', 'A', 'BOY', 'AND', 'HIS', 'DOG', 'have', 'been', 'available', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'have', 'delivered', 'good', 'letterbox', 'widescreen', 'digital', 'transfers', 'current', 'offering', 'First', 'Run', 'Features', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'version', 'also', 'interesting', 'feature', 'commentary', 'theatrical', 'trailers.All', 'A', 'BOY', 'AND', 'HIS', 'DOG', 'wonderful', 'interpretation', 'classic', 'SF', 'novella', 'DVD', 'will', 'make', 'great', 'entry', 'film', 'collections', 'SF', 'fans', 'who', 'love', 'quirky', 'non-mainstream', 'films']",A Boy & His Dog VHS

Unfortunately, I'm SOL. I love post-apocalyptic fiction and Sci-Fi(exceptTank Girl), and while I usually detest remakes, this is one that badly needs to be re-done, since Ellison's story was treated so badly. Actually, there are reports it's to be remade, but animated....oh goody, Disney & Pixar??One reviewer on IMDB said ""The acting is very good as well. Don Johnson is, surprisingly, dead-on as the arrogant post-apocalyptic punk"". Wow, far out! I'd never realized that good acting included having almost the entire movie being dubbed- I kind of expect a bunch of tiny Oriental people to start running around screaming about ""Godzirra!!"". Johnson has never had a whole lot of acting chops, but Blood the dog totally outshines him here. I do have to say that Blood's ""lines"", voiced-over by Tim McIntire steal the show.

378242,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6303507565,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 3]","A Boy and His Dog (L. Q. Jones, 1975)A Boy and His Dog was--and still is--widely seen as a failed, if valiant, experiment. I'm not entirely sure why; as far as I could tell, there's not a great deal about it that actually fails. Character actor L. Q. Jones, who acted in over one hundred movies during a five-decade (as of now, he seems to have retired; his last job in front of the camera as I write this was in 2006, though he seems to still be alive) career, only stepped behind the camera to direct a feature twice--1964's The Devil's Bedroom and this. Whether the decision not to direct again was his or Hollywood's I do not know. Judging by this film, either way, it was the wrong decision.Vic (Miami Vice's Don Johnson in an early role) and his dog Blood are inhabitants of a blasted, post-nuclear landscape where food and women are the most sought-after commodities, in that order. Blood, who communicates with Vic telepathically, tells tales of a place Over the Hills, where the land is still arable and existence isn't jst a daily grind. The two of them make a pact to try and get there, just as soon as they can save up enough supplies for the journey. There is also Under--a series of communities that sprung up far beneath the surface after World War IV destroyed it. While they are ruled by zealots (they're a grimly amusing precursor to today's ""gated communities""), life is much easier there. Or is it? Vic meets Quilla (The Last Horror Movie's Susanne Benton), who just may be the woman of his dreams, who's from Under, and after an attack, Vic and Quilla get separated from Blood, and Quilla takes Vic home for some life-saving surgery. At first, the community accepts him with open arms--but the longer he stays, the more he wonders if life under the strictly-regimented gaze of Lou Craddock (Jason Robards) is really better than life on the surface.Word on the street (at least word on IMDB) has it that Harlan Ellison began the screenplay himself, but it was taken over by Jones and producer Alvy Moore after Ellison suffered a case of writer's block. (I find that excuse somewhat hard to believe given that Ellison is--by far--one of the most prolific American writers of the past century.) This would explain the rather nave, black-and-white worldview the movie presents, which is probably the least Ellisonian thing about it. That said, this being mid-seventies sci-fi, expecting a subtle, shaded moral landscape would be... ridiculous, really. Even the greatest sci-fi films of the seventies were overly-simplistic in terms of their morals (Soylent Green, anyone?). I don't necessarily ding the movie for that any more than I ding it for presenting a world in which women are, for all intents and purposes, currency. It's a horrible idea to contemplate, but given the parameters of the world we are handed, it's also not an implausible one. (Lord knows once we get Under, the boys get their comeuppance with a vengeance.) This, of course, makes for an uncomfortable viewing experience--but then, one assumes, as one assumes in much dystopian science fiction, that's the idea. If you don't find, say, A Clockwork Orange uneasy viewing, that says a great deal more about you than it does about the film, I should think.A Boy and His Dog has faded unjustly into obscurity over the past four decades. It deserves to be rediscovered and placed on the same short shelf of seventies sci-fi-classics as many of the other films I have mentioned in this review. Both technically and artistically, this is a good, if disturbing, little movie, and it deserves much more attention than it gets. *** ",4,Post-Apocalypse Vice with Crockett and Blood.,1367712000,"05 5, 2013",2013,3611,"['Boy', 'Dog', 'L.', 'Q.', 'Jones', '1975', 'Boy', 'Dog', 'was', 'still', 'widely', 'seen', 'failed', 'valiant', 'experiment', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'why', 'as', 'far', 'could', 'tell', 'not', 'great', 'deal', 'actually', 'Character', 'actor', 'L.', 'Q.', 'Jones', 'who', 'acted', 'one', 'hundred', 'movies', 'five-decade', 'now', 'have', 'retired', 'last', 'job', 'front', 'camera', 'write', 'was', '2006', 'still', 'be', 'alive', 'career', 'only', 'stepped', 'camera', 'direct', 'feature', 'twice', '1964', 'Devil', 'Bedroom', 'decision', 'not', 'direct', 'again', 'was', 'Hollywood', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'Judging', 'film', 'way', 'was', 'wrong', 'decision.Vic', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'early', 'role', 'dog', 'Blood', 'are', 'inhabitants', 'blasted', 'post-nuclear', 'landscape', 'where', 'food', 'women', 'are', 'most', 'sought-after', 'commodities', 'order', 'Blood', 'who', 'Vic', 'telepathically', 'tells', 'tales', 'place', 'Hills', 'where', 'land', 'still', 'arable', 'existence', ""n't"", 'jst', 'daily', 'grind', 'two', 'make', 'pact', 'try', 'get', 'there', 'just', 'as', 'soon', 'can', 'save', 'up', 'enough', 'supplies', 'journey', 'also', 'series', 'communities', 'sprung', 'up', 'far', 'surface', 'World', 'War', 'IV', 'destroyed', 'are', 'ruled', 'zealots', ""'re"", 'grimly', 'amusing', 'precursor', 'today', 'gated', 'communities', 'life', 'much', 'easier', 'there', 'Vic', 'Quilla', 'Last', 'Horror', 'Movie', 'Susanne', 'Benton', 'who', 'just', 'may', 'be', 'woman', 'dreams', 'who', 'attack', 'Vic', 'Quilla', 'get', 'separated', 'Blood', 'Quilla', 'Vic', 'home', 'life-saving', 'surgery', 'first', 'community', 'open', 'arms', 'longer', 'more', 'life', 'strictly-regimented', 'gaze', 'Lou', 'Craddock', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'really', 'better', 'life', 'surface.Word', 'street', 'least', 'word', 'IMDB', 'Harlan', 'Ellison', 'began', 'screenplay', 'was', 'taken', 'over', 'Jones', 'producer', 'Alvy', 'Moore', 'Ellison', 'suffered', 'case', 'writer', 'block', 'find', 'excuse', 'somewhat', 'hard', 'believe', 'given', 'Ellison', 'far', 'one', 'most', 'prolific', 'American', 'writers', 'past', 'century', 'would', 'explain', 'rather', 'nave', 'black-and-white', 'worldview', 'movie', 'presents', 'probably', 'least', 'Ellisonian', 'thing', 'said', 'being', 'mid-seventies', 'sci-fi', 'expecting', 'subtle', 'shaded', 'moral', 'landscape', 'would', 'be', 'ridiculous', 'really', 'Even', 'greatest', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'seventies', 'were', 'overly-simplistic', 'terms', 'morals', 'Soylent', 'Green', 'anyone', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'ding', 'movie', 'more', 'ding', 'presenting', 'world', 'women', 'are', 'intents', 'purposes', 'currency', 'horrible', 'idea', 'contemplate', 'given', 'parameters', 'world', 'are', 'handed', 'also', 'not', 'implausible', 'one', 'Lord', 'once', 'get', 'boys', 'get', 'comeuppance', 'vengeance', 'course', 'uncomfortable', 'viewing', 'experience', 'then', 'one', 'assumes', 'one', 'much', 'dystopian', 'science', 'fiction', 'idea', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'say', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'uneasy', 'viewing', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'film', 'should', 'think.A', 'Boy', 'Dog', 'faded', 'unjustly', 'obscurity', 'past', 'four', 'decades', 'be', 'rediscovered', 'placed', 'same', 'short', 'shelf', 'seventies', 'sci-fi-classics', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'mentioned', 'review', 'technically', 'artistically', 'good', 'disturbing', 'little', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'attention', '***']",A Boy & His Dog VHS
378243,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,6303507565,Robert I. Hedges,"[1, 1]","""A Boy and His Dog"" is one of the strangest science fiction movies to come out of the 1970's. The then-unknown Don Johnson stars as Vic, a survivor of World War Four, who roams the post-apocalyptic wasteland with his best friend, a dog named Blood. Blood is no ordinary dog, though: he is a hyper-intelligent mutation who can telepathically speak to Vic (voiced with sarcastic resignation by Tim McIntire.) The film is based on a novella by Harlan Ellison, and is equal parts commentary on the geopolitics of the cold war (as perceived in the mid 1970's,) and horrific survivalist black comedy (some would argue they were the same thing.)I found the film entertaining, though sometimes for the wrong reasons. It is effective as a dark comedic piece, though the acting was sometimes a bit stilted even from such greats as Jason Robards (in possibly his creepiest role) and Alvy Moore. The surrealism of the subterranean world that Johnson discovers is both highly amusing and alarming, and features frequently unexpected plot twists. In this regard director L. Q. Jones (Justus McQueen) achieves his goal, and despite the ridiculous talking dog concept central to the movie, the feature works better than I expected. As an aside, the commentary is very illuminating, and covers many directorial and production decisions, including a lengthy discussion of the pros and cons of having Blood's lips move during his dialogue.I was frankly torn about what rating the film should have: on one hand it is a bit heavy-handed and ponderous, the pacing can lag at times, and some of the performances seem intermittently wooden, but on the other hand the movie is extremely creative, and viscerally captures the attitudes of the era better than many works of historical nonfiction, and certainly better than the vast majority of sci-fi films ever could. I settled on four stars: the film does have flaws, but is still fun to watch. I was especially pleased with the conclusion of the film that involved both supremely sly writing and nuanced acting from Johnson, making it clear that Vic had finally correctly come to terms with the priorities in his life. I recommend ""A Boy and His Dog"" as a bizarre cold war relic and blast from the past version of 1970's dystopian filmmaking.",4,"""I've Gotta' Get Back in The Dirt So I Feel Clean!""",1303603200,"04 24, 2011",2011,2268,"['Boy', 'Dog', 'one', 'strangest', 'science', 'fiction', 'movies', 'come', '1970', 'then-unknown', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'Vic', 'survivor', 'World', 'War', 'Four', 'who', 'post-apocalyptic', 'wasteland', 'best', 'friend', 'dog', 'named', 'Blood', 'Blood', 'ordinary', 'dog', 'hyper-intelligent', 'mutation', 'who', 'can', 'telepathically', 'speak', 'Vic', 'voiced', 'sarcastic', 'resignation', 'Tim', 'McIntire', 'film', 'based', 'novella', 'Harlan', 'Ellison', 'equal', 'parts', 'commentary', 'geopolitics', 'cold', 'war', 'perceived', 'mid', '1970', 'horrific', 'survivalist', 'black', 'comedy', 'would', 'argue', 'were', 'same', 'thing', 'found', 'film', 'entertaining', 'sometimes', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'effective', 'dark', 'comedic', 'piece', 'acting', 'was', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'stilted', 'even', 'such', 'greats', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'possibly', 'creepiest', 'role', 'Alvy', 'Moore', 'surrealism', 'subterranean', 'world', 'Johnson', 'discovers', 'highly', 'amusing', 'alarming', 'features', 'frequently', 'unexpected', 'plot', 'twists', 'regard', 'director', 'L.', 'Q.', 'Jones', 'Justus', 'McQueen', 'goal', 'ridiculous', 'talking', 'dog', 'concept', 'central', 'movie', 'feature', 'better', 'expected', 'aside', 'commentary', 'very', 'illuminating', 'many', 'directorial', 'production', 'decisions', 'including', 'lengthy', 'discussion', 'pros', 'cons', 'having', 'Blood', 'lips', 'move', 'dialogue.I', 'was', 'frankly', 'torn', 'what', 'rating', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'one', 'hand', 'bit', 'heavy-handed', 'ponderous', 'pacing', 'can', 'lag', 'times', 'performances', 'seem', 'intermittently', 'wooden', 'other', 'hand', 'movie', 'extremely', 'creative', 'viscerally', 'attitudes', 'era', 'better', 'many', 'works', 'historical', 'nonfiction', 'certainly', 'better', 'vast', 'majority', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'ever', 'could', 'settled', 'four', 'stars', 'film', 'have', 'flaws', 'still', 'fun', 'watch', 'was', 'especially', 'pleased', 'conclusion', 'film', 'involved', 'supremely', 'sly', 'writing', 'nuanced', 'acting', 'Johnson', 'making', 'clear', 'Vic', 'had', 'finally', 'correctly', 'come', 'terms', 'priorities', 'life', 'recommend', 'A', 'Boy', 'Dog', 'bizarre', 'cold', 'war', 'relic', 'blast', 'past', 'version', '1970', 'dystopian', 'filmmaking']",A Boy & His Dog VHS
378244,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,6303507565,Robert J. Crawford,"[8, 11]","This is a wonderful gem of a film, about the wreckage that survives in the wake of the nuclear holocaust.  The young Don Johnson is the boy, and he demonstrates greater talent as an actor than any of his subsequent TV junk.  He is the dog's sidekick, which is trying to educate him about American presidents (!), as they try to get along in the desolate landscape and chaos.

After more global thermonuclear wars than anybody can count, America is a wasteland, covered up by mud.  The remains of most cities are buried under ground, as are most of the products (canned peaches being a favorite; weapons and ammo and porno films also being top draws) that postwar denizens actively seek.  Blood, we learn, was one of the technological innovations of the wars - an intelligent if still vicious animal bonded telepathically to a human to form a hunter-killer team.  With the wars over, the wasteland is covered with canine-human duos like Vic and Blood - with the humans providing the muscle to find food and to protect the dogs.  In a set-up that gives a new spin to the term ""tail wagging the dog"", the canine half provides the real end of the team - Blood uses his telepathic powers to ""sniff"" out women, who in the post-apocalyptic setting are seen as fit for nothing but temporary pleasure.  Blood proves his worth early in the film when, while the two take in a porno flick along with dozens of other teams, Blood is the first to sense the nearby presence of a woman.  With Blood's help, Vic traps the seemingly virginal Quilla June.  Unfortunately the headstart isn't long enough, and Vic and Blood find themselves in a firefight over the woman, too embroiled with the other HK teams to realize that Quilla June has plans of her own - plans for Vic that don't include Blood or the wanderers' life that is the only existence Vic knows of.""A Boy and His Dog"" (aka ""Psycho Boy and His Killer Dog, Blood"") is a pretty thin story, which is why it's the director's credit that the flick is just so much fun.  The settings are cheap, but not unconvincing - it could very well have been filmed by denizens of the post-apocalypse.  This could very well have been one of the movies filmed for the fun of the rape-teams (they would've severely dissed the lack of gratuitous sex and nudity, but the flick ends on a subtly shocking dark joke, one they'd definitely appreciate).  In any event, the flick beats any of the similarly themed and more expensive flicks (barring the ""Road Warrior"" flicks, but definitely including ""The Postman"").  Beyond the novelty of a young Don Johnson, you've got the sarcastic and bloodthirsty reparte of  whoever plays the voice of ""Blood"", though I'd see this again Sussanne Benton who, as Quilla June, manages to be emulate innocence, ambition and seduction very well.

Well, this particular tale of the old-time cliche has telepathic canines, green glowing monsters (albeit unseen ones), cannibalism (of course), and semen-stealing underground societies with a mime-like face paint motif. Got your attention? Good. This is a post-apocalyptic science fiction tale for the ages based on the classic novella by Harlan Ellison and it's gooooood. I'm talking about a movie where the hero (Vic) exploits his partner, a telepathic and extremely intelligent (and snide) dog named Blood, to find women to rape. Vic gets the food, Blood finds the women. What a damn premise! Let me tell you, if I was in a post-apocalyptic wasteland a hyper-intelligent talking dog would be at the top of my list for partners. That or a vampire girl. A really hot vampire girl. Who is also a ninja. Wait, what was I talking about? Right. Post-apocalyptic stuff. The world Vic and Blood wander is an alternate Earth where the Kennedys were never assassinated which led to no less than three different presidents bearing the name. While the movie doesn't do the best job of explaining, choosing to simply explore the world while teasing the audience with bits of history that Blood attempts to bludgeon into his less-than-intelligent partner's head. Vic was born after the apocalypse so he has no sense of society outside of the wasteland. This is a damn great setup for a story.After arguing with Blood at a makeshift theater showing an old dirty movie (the dog likes his popcorn), Vic convinces his companion to reveal to him that there is a lady hidden in the audience. Turns out she's about damn sexy too. But they are going to have to fight for her. At this point, the film goes from insanely cool to meh. The final acts separate our two ""heroes"" (bad move) and reveal an insanely creepy underground society attempting to preserve the good ol' days. Or at least, a bizarre approximation of it. Naturally, this means religion. Lots of religion. Oddly enough, this part of the story takes up too much screentime while at the same time is not developed enough. It seems like it could be an interesting story unto itself, but in this particular film it feels like an interruption of our regularly-scheduled prgoram that isn't fleshed-out enough to justify itself. It kind of kills the awesome tone of the film a little although it would be a cool story given more development. Thankfully, the whole thing ends up worthwhile with one of the best and most joyously twisted ending of any film ever. If you see it coming, I will eat my keyboard.While the tale has been criticized for misogyny, I feel that the world the story takes place in is one where even the heroes are bad people preying on those weaker than themselves and is meant as a statement on humanity as a whole. Having the protagonists on the hunt for girls to rape is not the most PC premise of all time, but it makes sense for the story and the world inhabited by that story. Don't let the fact that the only being (if any) considered worth saving is a dog fly over your head, either. In my mind, that's the premise and any misogyny is a means to that end.  A Boy and His Dog is a very entertaining film that makes up for what it lacks in effective exposition with attitude and humor. As far as visions of a post-apocalyptic future go, this is one of the coolest by far. I feel another half hour could have made this a five-star film, but as it is it is still a must-see. Ellison actually made a sequel to the story in graphic novel form (although turns out he did it literally to spite pushy fans), and I do believe I'll check that out.",4,"""World War IV lasted five days.

Jones. Shout Factory continues to do a good job of putting out cult classics on Blu.SPOILERS:Set in a post Apocalpytic world where food and women are scarce, Vic (Don Johnson) his telepathic dog Blood (the voice of the late Tim McIntire who also co-wrote the music score)hunt for both and get more than they bargained for when they meet Quilla June (Susanne Benton). Quilla has escaped from an entire community underground and she lures him back into a trap ready to be sprung by the leader of the town (Jason Robards).END OF SPOILERS:The blu-ray transfer of ""A Boy and His Dog"" is the best the film has ever looked on home video. An early DVD release the film receives an improved transfer for its high def debut. The source print could have used some sprucing up but, on the whole,the film looks nice. ""A Boy and His Dog"" will never look as sharp or brilliant as a contemporary film but Shout has done the best with the source as possible.Unfortunately, only the original mono elements are available for the soundtrack so we don't get a 5.1 lossless presentation. Still, the mono lossless presentation sounds quite nice with dialog to the forefront of the mix.The special features include a good commentary track with director L.Q. Jones, his director of photography John Arthur Morrill, and Critic Charles Champlin which appeared on the 1999 DVD.New to this set is a fifty minute conversation between director Jones and author Ellison. It also appears on the DVD. They still disagree about the last line of the film (Ellison still hates it)but they clearly enjoy each other's company. We also get the original theatrical trailer and radio ads for the films.A well made low budget science fiction film (and one of the few adapted from Ellison's work that manages to be relatively faithful to the source) with a good transfer and some nice extras, ""A Boy and His Dog"" is well worth catching.",4,This Dog can hunt....,1376265600,"08 12, 2013",2013,2006,"['Harlan', 'Ellison', 'classic', 'story', 'fine', 'film', 'adaptation', 'actor/director', 'case', 'writer', 'L.Q', 'Jones', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'putting', 'out', 'cult', 'classics', 'Blu.SPOILERS', 'Set', 'post', 'Apocalpytic', 'world', 'where', 'food', 'women', 'are', 'scarce', 'Vic', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'telepathic', 'dog', 'Blood', 'voice', 'late', 'Tim', 'McIntire', 'who', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'music', 'score', 'hunt', 'get', 'more', 'bargained', 'when', 'meet', 'Quilla', 'June', 'Susanne', 'Benton', 'Quilla', 'escaped', 'entire', 'community', 'underground', 'back', 'trap', 'ready', 'be', 'sprung', 'leader', 'town', 'Jason', 'Robards', '.END', 'SPOILERS', 'blu-ray', 'transfer', 'A', 'Boy', 'Dog', 'best', 'film', 'ever', 'looked', 'home', 'video', 'early', 'DVD', 'release', 'film', 'improved', 'transfer', 'high', 'def', 'debut', 'source', 'print', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'sprucing', 'up', 'whole', 'film', 'nice', 'Boy', 'Dog', 'will', 'never', 'look', 'sharp', 'brilliant', 'contemporary', 'film', 'Shout', 'done', 'best', 'source', 'possible.Unfortunately', 'only', 'original', 'mono', 'elements', 'are', 'available', 'soundtrack', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', '5.1', 'lossless', 'presentation', 'Still', 'mono', 'lossless', 'presentation', 'quite', 'nice', 'dialog', 'forefront', 'mix.The', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'good', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'L.Q', 'Jones', 'director', 'photography', 'John', 'Arthur', 'Morrill', 'Critic', 'Charles', 'Champlin', 'appeared', '1999', 'DVD.New', 'set', 'fifty', 'minute', 'conversation', 'director', 'Jones', 'author', 'Ellison', 'also', 'DVD', 'still', 'disagree', 'last', 'line', 'film', 'Ellison', 'still', 'clearly', 'enjoy', 'other', 'company', 'also', 'get', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'radio', 'ads', 'films.A', 'well', 'made', 'low', 'budget', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'one', 'few', 'adapted', 'Ellison', 'work', 'be', 'relatively', 'faithful', 'source', 'good', 'transfer', 'nice', 'extras', 'Boy', 'Dog', 'well', 'worth', 'catching']",A Boy & His Dog VHS

A Boy and His Dog tells the story of a post-apocalyptic world where women are scarce commodities to be hunted.  Don Johnson (young and pre-Miami Vice) plays Vic, a wanderer in the devistated wasteland whose number one priority is indulging his carnal lust in pursuit of the opposite sex.  Vic's sole companion in his travels is a dog who he shares a psychic bond with and whose hunting talents come in handy by catching the scent of nearby females.  Unfortunately the latest gal this twosome encounters has plans for Vic, which will lead him into a strange underground world.The movie has obvious budgetary limitations, but L.Q.
