Andersen,"[6, 13]","The basic plot of LA RONDE (used previously for such films as THE YELLOW ROLLS ROYCE) is rehashed here in the form of a famous violin and its many owners since its creation.  It's a cursed thing so brings only tragedy to  those who covet it (somewhat like Wagner's RING).  This vastly overlong  film is lethargically directed with no point of view or connecting thread  between the stories and when we get the great revelation at the end we  realize we guessed it in the first reel.  The faux &quot;classical&quot;  music score by serious composer John Corigliano was Oscared.  The Art  Direction, Costume Design and Cinematography are all of merit and worth  mention but the thing never gets off the ground or soars - you'd think it  would considering the music the instrument makes.  If you're an  afficianodo of the violin, this will please you.

515638,A9998RE3AEA95,B000031WD7,Alex,"[2, 2]","&quot;The Red Violin&quot; is mystifying and episodic. It is a story of, not surprisingly, a violin, wrought in the late seventeenth century by a grief-stricken artisan. The film follows the instrument from epoch to epoch as it crosses borders and changes owners - in the course of its existence it rested in the hands of vagabonds and prodigies, it was buried and exhumed, destroyed and restored. Indeed, in an almost supernatural way, the instrument seems to bewitch men, and its every owner almost inevitably comes to a terrible end. The film also uses a very original method of narration - all episodes are tied to two &quot;hub&quot; sequences: the artisan's wife's last tarot session, which mysteriously seems to follow the violin's journey; and the 1998 auction where the violin's final owner is about to be desided. There is even some metaphorical &quot;echoing&quot; between the eras: when the violin is frequency-tested and shivers violently, the artisan's wife (back in 17th century Italy) experiences a sudden pang of agony.Though I am hardly an expert, the film seems to be masterfully produced. The locales appear very realistic, though it was sometimes somewhat hard to recognize one spoken language from another (the film relies heavily on subtitles). And, to say the least, the violin music is otherworldly. Though at the outset I had my doubts about the entertainment value of a film dealing with a subject that to me is abstruse and arcane, I can honestly say that &quot;The Red Violin&quot; is extraordinary entertainment.",4,The curse of the red violin,983577600,"03 3, 2001",2001,1542,"['quot', 'Red', 'Violin', 'quot', 'mystifying', 'episodic', 'story', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'violin', 'wrought', 'late', 'seventeenth', 'century', 'grief-stricken', 'artisan', 'film', 'instrument', 'epoch', 'epoch', 'borders', 'changes', 'owners', 'course', 'existence', 'rested', 'hands', 'vagabonds', 'prodigies', 'was', 'buried', 'exhumed', 'destroyed', 'restored', 'Indeed', 'almost', 'supernatural', 'way', 'instrument', 'bewitch', 'men', 'owner', 'almost', 'inevitably', 'terrible', 'end', 'film', 'also', 'very', 'original', 'method', 'narration', 'episodes', 'are', 'tied', 'two', 'quot', 'hub', 'quot', 'sequences', 'artisan', 'wife', 'last', 'tarot', 'session', 'mysteriously', 'follow', 'violin', 'journey', '1998', 'auction', 'where', 'violin', 'final', 'owner', 'be', 'desided', 'even', 'metaphorical', 'quot', 'echoing', 'quot', 'eras', 'when', 'violin', 'frequency-tested', 'shivers', 'violently', 'artisan', 'wife', 'back', '17th', 'century', 'Italy', 'sudden', 'pang', 'agony.Though', 'am', 'hardly', 'expert', 'film', 'be', 'masterfully', 'produced', 'locales', 'appear', 'very', 'realistic', 'was', 'sometimes', 'somewhat', 'hard', 'recognize', 'one', 'spoken', 'language', 'film', 'heavily', 'subtitles', 'say', 'least', 'violin', 'music', 'otherworldly', 'outset', 'had', 'doubts', 'entertainment', 'value', 'film', 'dealing', 'subject', 'abstruse', 'arcane', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'quot', 'Red', 'Violin', 'quot', 'extraordinary', 'entertainment']",N/A

Nearing  the end of the movie, there is a flashback which shows Nicolo, griefed by  the death of his loved ones, preserving the memory (and spirit?) of his  dead wife onto the Red Violin. How he does it seems quite macabre to me,  although some viewers may find it romantic.It is also very interesting  and suspenseful to see who finally &quot;gets&quot; the famous violin in  the end, when it's being auctioned off by the Duval House.This movie is  perfect in every way, with breathtaking cinematography and you get to  &quot;experience&quot; the many different cultures of the world spanning  over 300 years, from Italy in the 17th century to Vienna, 19th century  England and China during the heights of the Cultural Revolution (when  Western arts, music and influences were among the items banned).The cast  is international and the dialogue is appropriately done in various  languages in accordance to the particular culture and time.

Overlooked by the arbiters of most of the major awards ceremonies, The Red Violin nonetheless enjoyed widespread critical acclaim. And every bit of its praise is well-deserved. Because The Red Violin belongs on a list of the best films of its decade...Charles Morritz (Samuel Jackson) is called on by a Montreal auction house to assess the value of a recently procured violin. His initial reaction is that the violin is the long-lost, world famous Nicolo Bussotti ""Red Violin"". In verifying its authenticity, the film flashes back to the birth of the violin...When famous Italian violin maker Nicolo Bussotti (Carlo Cecchi) witnesses the tragic death of his pregnant wife and true love, he designs the perfect violin as a testament to her memory. Originally intended for his son, the violin makes it way across the continent of Europe, first appearing in an orphanage where child prodigy Kaspar Weiss (Christoph Koncz) comes in possession of it. Ushered off to Vienna and poised on the precipice of worldwide fame, Weiss suffers a heart attack, and the violin is buried with him. However, when his grave is looted, gypsies give a home to the violin for some time before it is purchased by the mad genius Frederick Pope (Jason Flemyng). When Pope injures the heart of his longtime lover Victoria (Greta Scacchi), the violin is damaged by a bullet...A servant of Pope's eventually takes the violin to the Asian Continent where it is used first as a teacher's aide, then hidden during the Communist revolution which fears the evils of 'Western music'. When the Shanghai violin collector in possession of the red violin passes away, the Chinese government places his multi-million dollar collection on the auction block. Finding the red violin in its midst, two experts work to verify its authenticity, and when they do a fierce bidding war takes place to see who will get the prized possession. But an article of such great value can only be held by someone who truly appreciates its beauty...With outstanding performances from an unprecedented number of actors and actresses, The Red Violin is a production of genius on par with the perfection of its lead character - the hand-crafted red violin. Samuel L. Jackson is the only star of the film who's of Hollywood blockbuster caliber, and he shines brightly in his role - using his penetrating eyes to convey a sort of mystic power upon the object of his desire. Coupled with an original storyline, having all the more of an impact due its suspenseful chronology, The Red Violin is an unforgettable film of passion and adventure...Boasting a well-written screenplay, and direction that displays all the symbolism and emotion expected from a classic novel, The Red Violin is a film that strives to touch the polarities of the human soul. With an emotional passion that emanates from the screen, the film forces us to contemplate the wonder of human existence and what exactly will be our individual place in its history. A modern day epic regarding the travels of a beautiful blood-red violin through various centuries of the human experience, The Red Violin is a definite must-see film...The DVD Report",5,Don't miss this cinema masterpiece...,1113955200,"04 20, 2005",2005,3306,"['Winner', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Music', 'Original', 'Score', 'John', 'Corigliano', 'Red', 'Violin', 'should', ""'ve"", 'very', 'least', 'received', 'Best', 'Picture', 'nomination', 'Overlooked', 'arbiters', 'most', 'major', 'awards', 'ceremonies', 'Red', 'Violin', 'nonetheless', 'enjoyed', 'widespread', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'bit', 'praise', 'well-deserved', 'Red', 'Violin', 'list', 'best', 'films', 'decade', 'Charles', 'Morritz', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'called', 'Montreal', 'auction', 'house', 'assess', 'value', 'recently', 'procured', 'violin', 'initial', 'reaction', 'violin', 'long-lost', 'world', 'famous', 'Nicolo', 'Bussotti', 'Red', 'Violin', 'verifying', 'authenticity', 'film', 'back', 'birth', 'violin', 'When', 'famous', 'Italian', 'violin', 'maker', 'Nicolo', 'Bussotti', 'Carlo', 'Cecchi', 'tragic', 'death', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'true', 'love', 'perfect', 'violin', 'testament', 'memory', 'Originally', 'intended', 'son', 'violin', 'way', 'continent', 'Europe', 'first', 'appearing', 'orphanage', 'where', 'child', 'prodigy', 'Kaspar', 'Weiss', 'Christoph', 'Koncz', 'possession', 'Ushered', 'Vienna', 'poised', 'precipice', 'worldwide', 'fame', 'Weiss', 'heart', 'attack', 'violin', 'buried', 'However', 'when', 'grave', 'looted', 'gypsies', 'give', 'home', 'violin', 'time', 'purchased', 'mad', 'genius', 'Frederick', 'Pope', 'Jason', 'Flemyng', 'When', 'Pope', 'heart', 'longtime', 'lover', 'Victoria', 'Greta', 'Scacchi', 'violin', 'damaged', 'bullet', 'servant', 'Pope', 'eventually', 'violin', 'Asian', 'Continent', 'where', 'used', 'first', 'teacher', 'aide', 'then', 'Communist', 'revolution', 'evils', ""'Western"", 'music', 'When', 'Shanghai', 'violin', 'collector', 'possession', 'red', 'violin', 'away', 'Chinese', 'government', 'places', 'multi-million', 'dollar', 'collection', 'auction', 'block', 'Finding', 'red', 'violin', 'midst', 'two', 'experts', 'work', 'verify', 'authenticity', 'when', 'do', 'fierce', 'bidding', 'war', 'place', 'see', 'who', 'will', 'get', 'prized', 'possession', 'article', 'such', 'great', 'value', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'held', 'someone', 'who', 'truly', 'beauty', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'unprecedented', 'number', 'actors', 'actresses', 'Red', 'Violin', 'production', 'genius', 'par', 'perfection', 'lead', 'character', 'hand-crafted', 'red', 'violin', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'only', 'star', 'film', 'who', 'Hollywood', 'blockbuster', 'caliber', 'brightly', 'role', 'using', 'penetrating', 'eyes', 'convey', 'sort', 'mystic', 'power', 'object', 'desire', 'Coupled', 'original', 'storyline', 'having', 'more', 'impact', 'due', 'suspenseful', 'chronology', 'Red', 'Violin', 'unforgettable', 'film', 'passion', 'adventure', 'Boasting', 'well-written', 'screenplay', 'direction', 'symbolism', 'emotion', 'expected', 'classic', 'novel', 'Red', 'Violin', 'film', 'touch', 'polarities', 'human', 'soul', 'emotional', 'passion', 'screen', 'film', 'forces', 'contemplate', 'wonder', 'human', 'existence', 'what', 'exactly', 'will', 'be', 'individual', 'place', 'history', 'modern', 'day', 'epic', 'regarding', 'travels', 'beautiful', 'blood-red', 'violin', 'various', 'centuries', 'human', 'experience', 'Red', 'Violin', 'definite', 'must-see', 'film', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

The movie expertly interweaves the fortune told to Anna, wife of the violin maker Niccoli Bussoti, through tarot cards, and the adventures of the violin as it passes through the hands of its unfortunate owners.  By finishing the red violin with a secret in the varnish, Bussoti has nailed the fate of each of the owners of the violin to the fate that the cards foretold to Anna.  Throughout the film, the soulful and haunting music carries the viewer from an orphan prodigy, to gypsies roaming throughout Europe to the hands of the diablo, English virtuoso Frederick Pope, who plays her with a devilish flair.  She is tried, almost by fire, and when she finally yields her secret to Morritz (violin appraiser), another link to a human life is forged.  What this violin has, is a soul, and a curse, and an ability to totally possess its owner or those who come in contact with her.  Therefore as some noted that the humans in this story were one-dimensional, pathetic, and colorless, it only goes to contrast that the real star of this story is the red violin, who is soulful, hauntingly enchanting, desirous, and ultimately pierces the lives of those who have become possessed by her.

This film looked great in previews and in about ten to fifteen minutes of its total run-time it did hit its target, but during most of its two-hour length it was simply stretching to be greater than it was capable of being in the hands of those who made it. Samuel L. Jackson was wrong for the part he played, and was he even acting or just grunting and scowling his way to a paycheck? He seemed so groundlessly angry and unpleasant, so miscast and unbelievable in his role that he distracted from the goings-on that should have held the attention at vitally significant times.The storyline of the intricate and improbable history of a treasured ""red violin"" as it journeys through time from creation in the seventeenth-century to its present whereabouts in a greed-fueled auction house ranges from addictively fascinating to distancing, with the best moments of the plot being set in Maoist China (where an idealistic woman struggles to save it during a Communist purge) and an eighteenth-century monastery (where a child prodigy prepares for a performance). The Victorian segment with the nihilistic English lord who played the violin like a madman as he romped satyr-like with women made me giggle, and I don't think that's what the filmmakers were aiming for. In the end I found the historical segments of infinitely more interest to me than the tale of the violin's would-be trip to the auction block in the 1990's.

A very metaphysical violin.  The people moving in and out of the story are mere props.  Such a formula--one would think--would invite tepid disaster, but director Francois Girard gracefully maneuvers and interweaves the violin's story in this exquisitely handsome film, augmented by John Corigliano's haunting musical score.The story consists of a series of interconnected vignettes--the red violin being the common component.  And this little fiddle gets around--from Italy, where it was made in the 17th Century, to Austria, England, China, and finally, Canada.  As it garners its reputation as the ""perfect acoustical instrument,"" the viewer is left to ponder (and it ain't that much of a mystery) the source of the violin's red varnish, ultimately revealed during the film's climactic sequence at a lush auction house.

Sure, there's no special extras at all, but the real problem lies in the subtitling, which is MISSING! So, instead, you have to turn on the ""closed captioning"" version of subtitling in order to understand the many different languages being spoken in the film... and this will alert you to sound effects and general noises in the film, as well as additionally subtitle the English dialogue. It's completely distracting and irritating, to the point where I found myself actually reaching over and disabling the subtitles whenever english was being spoken, constantly switching back and forth.Awful. I can't believe they're still printing this! Unless you speak fluent French, Italian, German, English, and Cantonese, you're going to be irritated by this version of the film.As far as the movie itself goes, it's a very good pop-art film.

The story itself is really a series of five vignettes about a mysterious, beautiful and powerful red violin, and those who come into contact with the item. Spanning several centuries, the stories examine the violin's history and the success and tragic circumstances that befall those who come into possession of the instrument.The violin itself is more than just a music instrument, however--it is alive to those who use it, see it and experience it. Could it help a sickly orphan boy become the next wunderkind? Could it help an aspiring musician impress and awe a large crowd? Each story is told through the use of a tarot holding and turning over cards, each circumstance and fate revealed. Many times, however, it appears that the violin-- not the fortune teller or the individual-- is the thing controlling fate.While at points the musical score and style outweighs and outshines some individual stories, The Red Violin is still a remarkable film with deep symbolism and beauty. I thought that the first three stories were by far the more compelling of the lot, and, truth be told, the film does lose a little steam towards its later stages and conclusion.However, in many ways, The Red Violin is a film to be admired and recommended, a hidden gem that you probably have never heard of.

The concerto is a vigorous, dramatic piece of music, with even a bit of emotional profundity about it, so I was expecting a movie of some depth. I have to say, I was disappointed. This is a sprawling edisodic melodrama, set in Renaissance Italy, Rococo Austria, Victorian England, and Maoist China, and when bow comes to string it's a movie about an art thief who succeeds, with no apologies. Now it's not every day that I get to practice my Italian, German, and Mandarin all in one sitting, so that's worth one star. The Italian and Austrian sets were beautiful, so there's another star. The ""monastery"" in the Alps was in reality a castle where I've spent time, so one star more for nostalgia.

This well-crafted saga of how a priceless, one-of-a-kind violin is passed onto various owners over time and in several countries, has been beautifully remastered. Presented in anamorphic widescreen and enchanced for widescreen TVs (16x9 aspect ratio, no black bars--the picture fills the entire screen), the picture is crystal clear and the colors are fresh and vibrant.I viewed this DVD on a 46-inch Samsung LCD high definition TV, played on a Toshiba 1080p HD DVD player--and the picture and sound are stunning. If you play this DVD on a player that can ""upconvert"" a regular DVD (such as this release),the resulting image is already high definition--no need for a separate Blu-ray or HD DVD edtion.The movie is itself, is of course, quite engaging and has more of a European/foreign film flair about it. The only well-known American movie star in this film is Samuel Jackson, who, although he is somewhat miscast in this role (as other reviewers have also noted), still manages to make his character believable--his inclusion in this movie was not a train wreck for me. The rest of the cast is quite good, although likely to be largely unknown to American audiences. If you appreciate beautiful violin music, accurate and elaborate period sets, other cultures and foreign languages (English subtitles are provided)--then you will love this film.The ""R"" rating for this film could have easily been avoided. There are two brief scences in one segement of the story involving partial nudity, one of which is a sex scene (involving the violin, no less), but these scenes are not graphic or violent--one of them is actually more like a pose (""caught in the act"" as it were). These scences could easily have been modified without compromising the plot, resulting in a PG-13 or even PG rating instead. Otherwise, there is no profanity or violence anywhere else in the film. This is a very light ""R"" film. I have seen PG-13 films that contain a greater amount of more objectionable material (frequent cursing, double entendres, etc.).

This always feels like an insult to my intelligence.  I'll feel what I want to feel, and I don't need sinister music to give me a cue!But then a movie like this comes along, which could never work without the music.  Really, the music IS the movie.  The plot is just a way to keep us interested in the meantime.  The real story can be found by listening carefully to the music.  The same basic melody is used many times, but is carefully nuanced for a different mood each time.Since the story's main character is a violin (a female, I think), we learn about this character not through dialogue, but through the music she gives us.  We get to watch the violin first in her infancy, so powerful and raw that she physically overcomes her first master.  Then we see her in adolescence- passionate, emotional, unfaithful...and so on.  Of course, violins live much longer than the average human, so this story encompasses four centuries.In the end, I believe, the prodigal violin is grown old and wise, and she finally realizes the destiny that her creator intended. A beautiful story, told through music and not through plot.  Watch and listen, and feel the emotion of the music take hold of you!If I had to complain about one thing, it would be Samuel Jackson.  His presence is completely superfluous, and I feel it detracts from the movie.  But then, if he wasn't in the movie, I would never have heard of it!

Sam Jackson, while only have a small roll is superb in this film, as is the rest of the assembled cast. The story beings in the work shop of Nicolo Vissotti, a master craftsman of string instruments. There, we follow him through tragedy, the untimely passing of his wife and son and follow her life through the eyes of a fortune teller. Anna, now passing through the centuries from one to another as a violin from the hands of a 10 year old prodigy, the hands of gypsy's and then a master, Lord Fredric Pope where she finally rests in the tumultuous Chinese government and it rise to Communism. There, the Red Violin passes to an auction where it is discovered who the true maker was and that the ""legend"" of the Red Violin is true as Sam Jackson discovers. A frenzied bid ensues as all want to lay claim to the Red Violin, many of those who share a past history with her.An excellent plot, script, acting and story line carries this film from start to finish, a timeless classic in my opinion. My only complaint about the DVD itself is the present format it is presented in, again (in my opinion) the current DVD available for purchase is far below satisfactory, in short...it sucks. My advice is that if you can find one, find the original DVD which was released sometime in 1998 or 1999 and stay away from the current DVD that is being sold. The language selection in the 2000-2003 release is quite bothersome. The older version provides subtitles only when needed (as this is more or less a foreign film), whereas the new releases of this film, the subtitles are on constantly and don't really qualify as ""subtitles for reading"" as they are more there for the hearing impaired.

It's not a masterpiece possibly, but a very well made movie--sophisticated, yet not boring. It was able to transmit emotion, or should I say generate emotion in the audience, without any effort of dictating or contaminating the experience, which is very common for Hollywood movies.The story was also very sentimental. I liked its rendition of muse as an energy form, and how sensuality, desire and music, beauty are like elements of a set that governs the universe, only if we are open to it. It shows money and power and pomposity, yet it also shows an aspect of humanity that makes us human, our desire to touch the divine, our connectedness--through beauty of past and present.A scenes can be symbolic of one's love and devotion to his/her vocation, his/her calling.The violin master loved his wife no doubt, and she deserved to be immortal through the best piece he ever created.

But, finally having seen it all the way through recently, I didn't expect it to be fascinating and even tear-inducing---Joshua Bell's violin solos and John Corigliano's music (which won a well-deserved Oscar) are almost beautiful beyond words.It is true that, on a whole, some parts of the film work better than others. This is basically an anthology of stories with the Red Violin being the connecting thread---barely---and while three of the stories are fascinating and even enlightening and moving (the Cremona, Vienna, and Montreal sequences), the two others (the Oxford and Shanghai sequences) are either unintentionally funny (the former) or simply slight and kinda pointless (the latter). And yet the dud sequences are hardly enough to counteract the great things in the movie: not only its technical flash and beautiful music, but its resonant theme about how we all, at one point or another, yearn for perfection and can't let it slip away so easily when we find it. Certainly instrument evaluator Charles Morritz (Samuel L. Jackson, in a restrained but powerful performance) cannot let his vision of perfection, which the Red Violin embodies, escape him.If nothing else, THE RED VIOLIN will perhaps enlighten non-music lovers about why we love the violin, and even music, so much.

515750,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B000031WD7,Lawyeraau,"[1, 2]","This is a superb film in which the star of the film is a violin known as ""The Red Violin'. It is a story that begins in Italy in the late seventeenth century and ends in the twentieth century. The violin is crafted by an Italian violin maker for his unborn child and is a work of sheer love. The viewer sees this distinctive red violin travel in time, as it becomes an integral part of the life of a variety of owners, transcending culture, race, class, and talent. It ultimately ends up as an offering at an auction house.The story is told in a series of intricately woven vignettes that are juxtaposed to the past and present in a series of well placed flash backs and flash forwards. The past is set in seventeenth century Italy, where the viewer sees what happens to a master violin maker's beautiful pregnant wife and unborn child. The present is set in the twentieth century at a posh auction house in Montreal, Canada, where a host of characters, who have a connection to the red violin's extraordinary and mysterious past, have gathered to bid upon it.The film is a lushly beautiful one due to its notable cinematography.  The music is exquisite, its impressive soundtrack made so by the superlative playing of violinist, Joshua Bell. The acting is uniformly stellar. The vignette of nineteenth century Victorian England virtuoso, Frederick Pope (Jason Flemyng), is wildly sensuous and erotic. There is even an quality of mysticism about the film, as the story in Italy begins with a fortune teller's predictions, which the violin maker's pregnant wife mistakenly thinks is about her, when in reality the fortuneteller is foretelling the future that lies in store for the red violin.In the twentieth century, Charles Morritz (Samuel L. Jackson) is an expert violin appraiser who has an appreciation of the now legendary red violin and covets it. While authenticating it for the auction house, he learns the secret of the distinctive red varnish that earns this instrument its sobriquet, though the viewer will, no doubt, guess its origin, long before he does. Morritz also does something that ensures that the red violin will stay with one who appreciates its value, so that the violin will have almost come full circle. In the end, all the elements come together beautifully, as the director, Francois Girard, deftly and seamlessly, weaves the violin's past with its present. There is not one discordant note in this richly complex and brilliant film. It is simply a masterpiece.

I had plucked the DVD from the bargain bin at the local video store for only a few dollars. I'd never heard of the film and bought it simply because I liked Samuel L. Jackson. Well, not only that, the decisive factor was that, at the time, all I had was a few dollars. So it was either this or a low budget Dolph Lundgren action flick (which I am not above, I might add). Still, I chose wisely. For two hours I was completely absorbed by the deftly told tale of a perfectly crafted violin's global journey throughout the centuries, culminating in the shockingly beautiful conclusion that ties together all the threads in a neat, satisfying tapestry.On that note let me make this clear - were I reviewing the film itself it would be five easy stars, as it's an under appreciated contemporary classic with beautifully shot cinematography and a screenplay so moving that Ingmar Bergman wishes he had written it. The acting is top notch as well: two highlights include the real life musical prodigy Christoph Koncz's moving portrayal as his fictional counterpart Kasper Weiss and Jason Flemyng as English violin virtuoso Frederick Pope. This Blu-Ray release, however, is a half hearted attempt at giving the film a high definition transfer and giving it as much as three stars would be extreme generosity on my part. As it is, two stars is more than fair.I owned the original Lions Gate release from that bargain bin years ago, then later upgraded to the Meridian Collection release (also by Lions Gate), which featured a slightly enhanced transfer of the film. It also included two new special features, one focusing on the trade of rare violins and the auctions that supply them along with another that focused on composer John Corigliano's heart-achingly beautiful score for the film. Once I received word of an upcoming high definition Blu-Ray release of ""The Red Violin"", I was sold from day one.Once I discovered that this is a Canadian import released by Alliance, I bought the Blu with rather low expectations. Alliance is known for releasing films with threadbare presentation values and lackluster audio/subtitle options, and ""The Red Violin"" makes no effort to enhance this reputation. There are three audio tracks, a 5.1 DTS English track, 5.1 Dolby Digital English track, and a 5.1 Dolby Digital French track. The trouble begins with the subtitle selection, or in this case the complete lack thereof. The disc provides mandatory subtitles for any spoken language other than English. If the viewer has trouble understanding or hearing the English scenes they're simply out of luck. There are absolutely no special features included, not even so much as a commentary track or a theatrical trailer.Continuing the disappointment, the film transfer was clearly supervised with minimal effort, an apparent hallmark of Alliance. ""The Red Violin"" has an image only marginally sharper than the Meridian Collection DVD. Even factoring in that it's a twelve year old catalog title, the HD presentation leaves much to be desired. The colors are much too muted and there is a distinct lack of clarity such as we expect from Blu-Ray. The film would benefit from a small degree of artificial enhancement, though such things must be handled with extreme delicacy and thus it's fortunate Alliance didn't attempt it.For the time being, I advise all fans of this nineties classic to retain their DVD copies. The dearth of options and lackluster film transfer simply doesn't warrant the hefty import price. Wait instead for the as yet unscheduled American release, which will hopefully receive the same care and attention the Meridian Collection DVD was given.

515756,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B000031WD7,Linda Linguvic,"[21, 25]","This 1998 film traces the history of &quot;The Red Violin&quot; to an auction house in modern Montreal where Samuel L. Jackson is cast as a violin authentication expert and is putting the instrument through a number of tests.  Through flashbacks and flash-forwards to the bidding process at the auction house, the viewer is treated to five different vignettes, in four different languages, each complete within themselves.It starts in 17th century Italy when a violin craftsman creates this special instrument for his unborn child.  His wife, who later dies in childbirth, visits a tarot card reader and the cards become a structure which follows the violin through the centuries.  The audience then follows the violin to a young child prodigy in an Austrian monastery, a camp of gypsies, a British virtuoso, and then to China, where the violin is labeled a decadent western instrument and is almost destroyed during the cultural revolution.  History sweeps by as we watch the violin in different times and places, but it is not until the very end that we finally discover the mystery of its color.This film won an Academy Award for the best original musical score and although I'm not a fan of classical music, I enjoyed it completely.  Every note seemed appropriate to its setting and showcased the talent of the composer, John Corigliano, as well as the musician, Joshua Bell.  Most of all, it complimented the stories and never detracted from them.Perhaps because each story was so brief, the characters just hinted at being developed fully.  However, the film was less about the characters than it was about the violin, and, once understanding that, I could appreciate the film for what it was, as well as appreciate the history of the violin and its place in European classical music.

Greta Sacchi, while she looks tired (as always)is very sexy (as always).  The problem is the script, which presents several pointless stories that are too loosely connected.

Now, however,  Francois Girard has made a small Canadian/Italian co-production with a  total budget no bigger, I presume, than Mel Gibson's asking price.  Yet THE  RED VIOLIN, which can be compared to a symphony of sorts, spans over three  centuries, in five different eras and countries.  More epic than even GONE  WITH THE WIND, but still as personal and intimate a tale as THE ENGLISH  PATIENT, Girard's film is a purely cinematic musical and artistic  triumph.One thing I especially admired about THE RED VIOLIN was its use  of language.  Unlike in most Hollywood period pieces, no one in 17th  century Italy (for example) speaks perfect English, or even English with an  Italian accent.  Each segment is performed in the language of its setting,  with English subtitles.  It all makes perfect sense to me.Visually, the  film is breathtaking.  The fabulous sets and costumes are photographed  lavishly by cinematographer Alain Dostie.  The acting is likewise superb,  with special mention going out to Carlo Cecchi as the Italian violinmaker,  Sylvia Chang as the Communist music-lover, and Samuel L Jackson in a small  role as the American violin expert.

I read all the positive reviews - has anyone actually looked beyond the expensive, lavish, ravishing, etc. costumes and sets and listened to the god awful dialogue in this film (particularly the scene between Pope and his mistress)?The acting by all concerned was stiff, lifeless, and oh-so earnest; and all of such a type I have to assume the director is to blame.  I never imagined Samuel L. Jackson would ever look wrong in front of a camera, but here the film-makers manage even to make this great actor appear shallow, despite staging him over and over in scenes of posed drama.Every single shot and scene looks like a very expensive perfume advertisement, and the director has absolutely no sense of pace. The characters are cardboard cutouts, expressing nothing but the most obvious of emotions and the writing would end up in the recycle bin of any competent romance novelist. Finally, was there anyone, anywhere that was surprised by the source of the violin's varnish (revealed in yet one more scene of swelling music and overly-pretty shots)?

It's by far one of the most uniquely wonderful films I've seen in the last ten years. I'm not someone who usually cares much for art cinema, but this one is so engaging and accessable as to be the perfect exception to that rule.I don't want to give too much away about the plot, but I will say this -- it follows the fate of a very special violin as it travels the world and ends up in the possession of many diverse people over four centuries. Everywhere it goes sadness, misery and death follow, so much so that when watching the film recently my friends and I came to the conclusion that it was decidedly (if unintentionally) Tolkienesque, with the Red Violin having an almost ""One Violin to Rule Them All"" feel to it.I love the way the various vignettes that make up the film's retelling of the Red Violin's past and present are independent of one another yet seamlessly blend into a perfect whole.My personal favourite is the breathtaking but all too short sequence in which the Red Violin falls into Romani (Gypsy) hands for many years... about the Gypsies robbing the grave to get it, I don't think that is what the director meant to imply. Yes, true Roma (Gypsies) certainly wouldn't have done so. I got the feeling that it was the French violin master who did it, and that later on it was obtained by the Gypsies.The ending of this film is the most tantalizingly shocking one I've seen since ""The Sixth Sense.""Altogether, an absolute classic!",5,SPECTACULAR!!!!,1012521600,"02 1, 2002",2002,1540,"['ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'how', 'thrilling', 'mind-blowing', 'epic', 'suspenseful', 'film', 'far', 'one', 'most', 'uniquely', 'wonderful', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'last', 'ten', 'years', ""'m"", 'not', 'someone', 'who', 'usually', 'much', 'art', 'cinema', 'one', 'so', 'engaging', 'accessable', 'be', 'perfect', 'exception', 'rule.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'plot', 'will', 'say', 'fate', 'very', 'special', 'violin', 'world', 'up', 'possession', 'many', 'diverse', 'people', 'four', 'centuries', 'Everywhere', 'sadness', 'misery', 'death', 'follow', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'watching', 'film', 'recently', 'friends', 'came', 'conclusion', 'was', 'decidedly', 'unintentionally', 'Tolkienesque', 'Red', 'Violin', 'having', 'almost', 'One', 'Violin', 'Rule', 'Them', 'All', 'feel', 'it.I', 'love', 'way', 'various', 'vignettes', 'make', 'up', 'film', 'retelling', 'Red', 'Violin', 'past', 'present', 'are', 'independent', 'one', 'yet', 'seamlessly', 'blend', 'perfect', 'whole.My', 'personal', 'favourite', 'breathtaking', 'too', 'short', 'sequence', 'Red', 'Violin', 'Romani', 'Gypsy', 'many', 'years', 'Gypsies', 'robbing', 'grave', 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'what', 'director', 'meant', 'imply', 'Yes', 'true', 'Roma', 'Gypsies', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'so', 'got', 'feeling', 'was', 'French', 'violin', 'master', 'who', 'did', 'later', 'was', 'obtained', 'Gypsies.The', 'ending', 'film', 'most', 'tantalizingly', 'shocking', 'one', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Altogether', 'absolute', 'classic']",N/A

Edelman,"[1, 1]","I was absolutely entranced through most of this movie, as the violin moved from its creation in the 18th Century, through different countries and different hands. Every episode was brilliantly done, and the repeated flashes to the present intensified the mystery and further intrigued me. The story of the birth of the violin, and the soul that possesses it, the tale orphan prodigy, the Paganinni-like English virtuoso- all brilliantly done stories, each of which could stand on its own as a short film. . The story of the violin's passage through the Chinese revolution was brilliantly done, and truly conveyed the fear and the madness of that era.And then the time frame shifted mainly to the present day- and that's where it lost me. A large problem, I think, was Samuel Jackson's performance. He simply did not convince me that he was from that world of rare instruments, and when he's fighting with his conscience over which course to take, that doesn't come across as all. The part of the repairman working under him was ill conceived as well- it was written as though he were a technician, largely unconcerned with the romance and the beauty of the instrument, and that made no sense at all. And last (spoiler alert) we're supposed to believe that he could swap a copy for a great. legendary instrument, and no one would catch on- and that a young repairman who had nothing to gain and everything to lose would go along with the fraud.

Rice ""'Mike Rice, Cultural Historian""","[2, 7]",": Son of Michael Powell's 1948 The Red Shoes with a new coat of red paintThe Red Violin has trouble deciding whether it is a costume picture or an art movie. The film traces the history of a rare violin from its birthplace in 1681 Italy. The instrument is headed for a 1998 auction house to be sold. Enter expert Samuel L. Jackson. Jackson knows rare violins. He recognizes this piece as one of a kind. Its not a Stradivarius. Its even more refined, a handmade instrument from an old Italian craftsman. Jackson is not the only one who sees through the plain trappings of the violin. A young scientist who measures the richness of fiddle acoustics, is also onto the red violin. The young man is actor Keith Gordon the same young skeptic who doubts Rodney Dangerfield's attempts at getting an education in the 1986 film Back to School. The Red violin is so famous there are knock-offs and copies circulating in the rare violin marketplace.As I mentioned, the first four historic scenarios through which the vintage violin travels are costume pieces. They are also choppy and differ in detail, authenticity and tone from the last auction house episode. On top of that the auction mystery is so richly separate in tone and character from other sequences, it is as if separate filmmakers were at work here.One sequence features a Viennese landowner who retrieves the instrument from a band of gypsies who are trespassing on his property. The aristocrat is a true eccentric. The music he plays on the Red Violin is extraordinary. His love affair with absurd European Duchess Greta Schacchi is so unnecessary, the episode plays like farce.Another episode takes us to China in the early 20th century then moves the daughter whose mother buys the pawned violin for her, to China's cultural revolution of the '60s. All old things are now considered reactionary. Violins are instruments which play &quot;decadent western music.&quot; The young girl, now grown up, takes flight to save the instrument. This sequence echoes the ridiculous woodenness of the cultural revolution itself. Characters are reduced to counterrevolutionary sloganeering. Its difficult to believe even the Maoists of that period could have cared so much about an off-colored violin.Scenes from the the first 17th century period when the instrument is made, explain its strange color.The last sequence is a mystery. It pays off a story that has been difficult to follow. The auction sequences take place in a European Capital, though the actors appear to be Canadians. Fittingly, the actor who actually auctions this fiddle played the title character in Thirty Two Short Films about Glenn Gould. The 1998 auction sequence saves the whole film from being little more than a comic book. Most of the violin music played throughout the films is exquisite and interesting in its variety and range.Samuel Jackson, Keith Gordon and the many others in the last sequence are superb. The last part redeems the entire film. The screenwriting is fine here as is the camerawork.

It starts in Italy, where a violin maker paints his dead wife and child's blood into the varnish of his latest creation.  Then the viewer watched the violin pass through the ages up to the modern day.  Whilst it's true that this method of drawing a tenuous link between several stories has been done before, this wasn't really the point of the story.  It's much more about the power of music and the spell it can cast.  In this sense it's a very important movie because, like 'Almost Famous' and 'Hilary And Jackie' have also stated, the power of music has mostly died in recent years.First of all the violin passes through an orphanage in Austria, where a child protegy takes hold of the violin.  Then it passes through a variety of people including gypsies, an unstable Victorian genius and to a group of suppressed art lovers in China.  All of this is well linked back to the first story as the woman who dies in the beginning has her fortune read and the viewer is given a small insight into what is going to happen in each successive story unfolding in front of them.  Between each story there is also the modern day auction of the fabled 'Red Violin', which stars an effectively subdued Samuel L. Jackson.It may be true that despite the powerful message concerning the importance of music (which is resonant at the end) there are few moments which will truly excite.

""This is my masterpiece, the rest is junk"" he tells his very pregnant wife, Anna. She is not a woman at peace. She consults a fortune-teller about her future and that of the arriving infant. The teller lays down the cards, and foresees and improbable future of exciting, fearful, joyful, murderous, lustful, melancholy  happenings. The prediction doesn't make sense, how can one life accommodate so many events, see so many twists of fate. Is this teller predicting a life of human being whose life span in that age must have averaged five decades? Seconds later, in wonderful image, John Corigliano Academy award winning violin score plays as the woman with her belly exposed enjoys a moment of sun before labour. The scene shifts from the mother and to the father in his workshop where another is being born: he is carving the infant of whom the fortune-teller speaks.Randomly, the violin falls into an Austrian monastery where the violin is used to teach young pupils. A hundred years pass, and one pupil, a diminutive six-year-old with a weak heart grows particularly attached to the instrument. He is gifted, and in this post-Amadues Austria, the world is on the lookout for such a prodigy. The monks fetch a teacher, he takes the boy to Austria to learn. The teacher is going broke, but offer the boy expensive cheese if he were to perfect his craft ""play violin, get cheese"" he tells the boys. A keenly observed relationship develops between the pupil and his imperfect teacher in what is the most affecting of the tales witnessed by the violin, the instrument the boy never lets go of, he even takes it to bed with him. This second tale also ends with an unforgettable image.At this point, years have passed since its conception, but Girard continues to consult his hawkish fortune-teller who says ""He will seduce you with his talent, but he is the devil"". He is Frederick Pope (Jason Flemyng), another gifted fiddler, but this time a professional. The word breathtaking is often used in movie reviews, so I will use another : muscle-stiffening to describe how he plays. Doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, but when he plays, and Girards camera observes him from a low angle commanding a sumptuous circular concert hall, you will find it physically hard to move. A grandiose figure. But with such obsession comes danger. And this is the most sordid, boldly melodramatic of the stories where Pope and his mistress are so possessive of one another to the point of being pathological. Their passion endangers the instrument. Its next stop, China at the heart of the revolution, and it being an instrument of ""the west"", it faces burning. Yet in the China story, the film's one weak link, where I think the story was simply to large to tell in such a small segment that was otherwise focused on the protagonists as characters rather then their position in a historic event. In the heart of that turmoil, the violin was never in danger as it was in the hands of the devil and his mistress.And then we're back again. The journey will surely end with some fat cat buying in the instrument, enclosing it in a case where it will observed by art critics who will marvel uselessly and pointlessly at the craftsmanship. The violin expert Charles Morritz (Samuel L. Jackson) ponders that. He asks his aid played by Don McKellar (who also co-wrote the film with the director) ""What would you do with it if you had it"". His aid replies ""I would take it apart and study it. It is single most perfect acoustical machine"". That well it may be, but we've just seen what makes it special. The Jackson's character final action seems all the more clear when you think about it. Through these stories, The Red Violin exquisitely chronicles a life that human beings can never live. The violin must go on, and the stories must go on.",4,Object of Desire,979776000,"01 18, 2001",2001,4692,"['Five', 'stories', 'spanning', 'four', 'centuries', 'three', 'continents', 'revolve', 'one', 'inanimate', 'object', 'blood', 'red', 'violin', 'Francois', 'Girard', 'Red', 'Violin', 'auction', 'twentieth', 'century', 'where', 'violin', 'title', 'marquee', 'item', 'film', 'room', 'abuzz', 'auctioneer', 'Colm', 'Feore', 'much-ballyhooed', 'instrument', 'are', 'several', 'nervous', 'crowd', 'gradually', 'learn', 'descendant', 'one', 'way', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'once', 'owned', 'instrument', 'What', 'mean', 'Why', 'do', 'want', 'so', 'much', 'How', 'much', 'are', 'willing', 'pay', 'way', 'delicately', 'unravels', 'Girards', 'film', 'what', 'work', 'art', 'means', 'what', 'private', 'abet', 'acquisition', 'bidding', '250,000.The', 'scene', 'then', 'Italy', '1681', 'where', 'man', 'Nicolo', 'Bussotti', 'carving', 'violin', 'yet', 'unborn', 'child', 'masterpiece', 'rest', 'junk', 'very', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'Anna', 'not', 'woman', 'peace', 'consults', 'fortune-teller', 'future', 'arriving', 'infant', 'teller', 'cards', 'foresees', 'improbable', 'future', 'exciting', 'fearful', 'joyful', 'murderous', 'lustful', 'melancholy', 'happenings', 'prediction', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'how', 'can', 'one', 'life', 'accommodate', 'so', 'many', 'events', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'twists', 'fate', 'teller', 'predicting', 'life', 'human', 'being', 'life', 'span', 'age', 'must', 'have', 'averaged', 'five', 'decades', 'Seconds', 'later', 'wonderful', 'image', 'John', 'Corigliano', 'Academy', 'winning', 'violin', 'score', 'plays', 'woman', 'belly', 'exposed', 'moment', 'sun', 'labour', 'scene', 'shifts', 'mother', 'father', 'workshop', 'where', 'being', 'born', 'carving', 'infant', 'whom', 'fortune-teller', 'speaks.Randomly', 'violin', 'Austrian', 'monastery', 'where', 'violin', 'used', 'teach', 'young', 'pupils', 'hundred', 'years', 'pass', 'one', 'pupil', 'diminutive', 'six-year-old', 'weak', 'heart', 'particularly', 'attached', 'instrument', 'gifted', 'post-Amadues', 'Austria', 'world', 'lookout', 'prodigy', 'monks', 'fetch', 'teacher', 'boy', 'Austria', 'learn', 'teacher', 'going', 'broke', 'offer', 'boy', 'expensive', 'cheese', 'were', 'perfect', 'craft', 'play', 'violin', 'get', 'cheese', 'boys', 'keenly', 'observed', 'relationship', 'pupil', 'imperfect', 'teacher', 'what', 'most', 'affecting', 'tales', 'witnessed', 'violin', 'instrument', 'boy', 'never', 'go', 'even', 'bed', 'second', 'tale', 'also', 'unforgettable', 'image.At', 'point', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'conception', 'Girard', 'consult', 'hawkish', 'fortune-teller', 'who', 'will', 'seduce', 'talent', 'devil', 'Frederick', 'Pope', 'Jason', 'Flemyng', 'gifted', 'fiddler', 'time', 'professional', 'word', 'breathtaking', 'often', 'used', 'movie', 'reviews', 'will', 'use', 'muscle-stiffening', 'describe', 'how', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'roll', 'off', 'tongue', 'when', 'Girards', 'camera', 'low', 'angle', 'commanding', 'sumptuous', 'circular', 'concert', 'hall', 'will', 'find', 'physically', 'hard', 'move', 'grandiose', 'figure', 'such', 'obsession', 'danger', 'most', 'sordid', 'boldly', 'melodramatic', 'stories', 'where', 'Pope', 'mistress', 'are', 'so', 'possessive', 'one', 'point', 'being', 'pathological', 'passion', 'instrument', 'next', 'stop', 'China', 'heart', 'revolution', 'being', 'instrument', 'west', 'burning', 'China', 'story', 'film', 'one', 'weak', 'link', 'where', 'think', 'story', 'was', 'simply', 'large', 'tell', 'such', 'small', 'segment', 'was', 'otherwise', 'focused', 'protagonists', 'characters', 'rather', 'then', 'position', 'historic', 'event', 'heart', 'turmoil', 'violin', 'was', 'never', 'danger', 'was', 'hands', 'devil', 'mistress.And', 'then', ""'re"", 'back', 'again', 'journey', 'will', 'surely', 'end', 'fat', 'cat', 'buying', 'instrument', 'enclosing', 'case', 'where', 'will', 'observed', 'art', 'critics', 'who', 'will', 'marvel', 'uselessly', 'pointlessly', 'craftsmanship', 'violin', 'expert', 'Charles', 'Morritz', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'ponders', 'aid', 'played', 'Don', 'McKellar', 'who', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'film', 'director', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'had', 'aid', 'would', 'take', 'apart', 'study', 'single', 'most', 'perfect', 'acoustical', 'machine', 'well', 'may', 'be', ""'ve"", 'just', 'seen', 'what', 'special', 'Jackson', 'character', 'final', 'action', 'more', 'clear', 'when', 'think', 'stories', 'Red', 'Violin', 'exquisitely', 'life', 'human', 'beings', 'can', 'never', 'live', 'violin', 'must', 'go', 'stories', 'must', 'go']",N/A

It's unique in that the central character is a one-of-a-kind violin that bewitches its owners and causes them to rise above their talent, rise above their humanity and that can prove to be as much a curse as a blessing.Samuel Jackson plays a stretch role for him and comes off as a very believable Violin restoration historian specialist guy (I'm sure there is a technical professional term for this sort of thing). Jackson proves he has a great deal of artistic depth and can tackle roles outside of those we usually see him playing in.This movie tackles a whole lot of history starting with the creation of the violin in the 17th century in Italy. Its unique genesis is at the heart of the story and we follow the violin from owner to owner leading us from Italy, to Austria, to England, to China, and finally to the modern day US (whoops did I say that..United States my arse, as the good Joli Rogers pointed out to moi it was really finally to Montreal...that's in Canada you know the French part...for you Americans Canada is that country North of us where Bob and Doug McKenzie are from) as a tense auction pulls all sorts of interesting ties to the violin now up for sale.What is lacking is more of a unity of story. I respect the uniqueness of pulling in stories within the story. The script writer and director were indeed brave and ambitious. But it plays like a series of short stories each one interesting but I wanted some connection more than what the violin could offer.

If this selection isn't made no subtitles appear whenever a foreign language is spoken, and they're spoken quite often throughout the film. Consequently, choosing ""English Subtitles"" from the Menu displays English subtitles even when English is spoken! The English subtitles were really designed and intended for the hearing impaired, since they're also displayed to describe sounds taking place such as ""beating heart"" or ""groan"". This really diminished the enjoyment of the film for me. When I saw the film in the theater I recall there being subtitles displayed only when foreign languages were spoken.

I love historical epics and although this film had the heart it didnt have the execution. The film is ostensibly  about the Red Violin but the instrument never takes on a character of its  own. The different period dramas the film moves thru seem forced and there  is never any character development that leaves you feeling connected with  the sweep of history that is supposed to be represented. The Samuel Jackson  character is a little ridiculous and the ending is unrealistic and  unfulfilling.

Central to its emotional core is a beautiful original score by American composer John Corigliano which weaves  a spell over all who encounter the violin.  The DVD presentation offers DTS  digital sound, a feature I had not before encountered on DVD.  My  receiver/amp lit up like a Christmas tree and my surround speakers took on  an enchanted life of their own.  The solo violin of Joshua Bell speaks for  the violin throughout the film.  I was very impressed with the sound and  the video image was consistently clean and sharp throughout.  There is an  interesting look at the making of the film in special features, plus a  partial cast listing that's a bit disappointing.  No matter!  The film  story is what is important here. At the outset, the film takes us to Italy  of the 1600s in the workshop of a violinmaker.  The master of this shop has  a young, pregnant wife and he shows her his finest violin...one he created  for their unborn son.  Troubled by strange feelings, the wife seeks out one  of her servants who reads Tarot cards, and from this point on, the film's  first plot device grabs the attention and never lets up.  There are five  cards.  The first card is turned over and its meaning explained.  We are  then shown that the baby is dead at birth and the wife died shortly after.  And you want to say, &quot;Whoa!&quot;  The next plot device appears in  modern-day Montreal where an auction of rare violins is in progress.  Each  time this scene appears throughout the movie, we see a different person in  the audience and are treated to that person's connection to the prized item  on which they wish to bid:  The Red Violin.  From there, the story unfolds  in time...Austria in the 1700s, England in the late 1890s (a very, very  sensual segment), China in the early 1920s and mid-1950s and finally back  to Montreal.  Back and forth the story moves, from auction to tarot reader  (a new card interpretation with each visit) to story, along with the  subplot of Samuel L. Jackson's master appraiser unraveling the mysteries of  the red violin prior to the start of the auction. It's a fascinating,  masterfully crafted film with wonderful performances and soaring music.  &quot;The Red Violin&quot; entertains and stuns.  This is a film crafted  by filmmakers who not only love film but love music.

Through these characters, we explore the universal human  propensities for fear, passion, jealousy, love, greed, oppression and  survival in even the most dire of circumstances. Like many anthology films,  &quot;The Red Violin&quot; loses some of its emotional force through the  fact that the characters, by their very nature, cannot be fully developed  and therefore tend a bit toward &quot;type&quot;. However, each segment is  so lovingly created in terms of setting, costume and cinematography, that  the viewer is drawn into the many worlds the film creates. The most  impressive part of the film is the brilliant overlapping time structure  that is remarkably complex and creates a tremendous amount of excitement  and tension in the last half hour of the film when all the elements from  the various narrative skeins are pulled together to reveal the whole  picture. In fact, the last half hour, in which the violin is restored and  the man in charge (played by Samuel L. Jackson) must confront a moral  dilemma, lifts the film to a plane far higher than one expects it to go.

On the whole, it was an underestimated film that year. It's truly a great film. The movie is rather long and very musical (after all its' a film about the voyage of a violin through different time periods and global locations) and this could be the reason why people were put off by the film. But even more likely it's because mainstream, youth-oriented MTV audiences don't care for art films. Many will be quick to label this movie art-house, eventhough Samuel L. Jackson is in it. The film follows the course of the life of a violin, from its creation in the 1600's Italian music scene- it's a Bussoti violin, close to perfection and monetal value as a Stradavarius. The violin's red color was made by blood, by the way, but you'll have to see the film to see why. The violin then undergoes a series of adventures as it is owned by different characters - from a Mozart-type child star in 1700's Vienna, to a Paganini-like violin virtuoso in the 19th century, traveling Gypsies and to the 20th century China where Communist/Cultural Revolutions are raging. Finally it ends up in an auction house.The DVD contains the movie in great form, a soundtrack and trailers. The film is really more than anything musical. The violin is expressed in its every face- cheerful, vibrant, yearning, despair, drama, tragedy, sadness, romance, love, sensuality, lyricism and even spirituality. This film should get you into the violin. It certainly did as much for me. I recommend this film for any music lover or if you are taking music appreciation classes. Teachers ought to show this film to music classes. There is nothing R-rated about it. There is no violence and the only sex scenes comes with the Paganini violinist who cheats on his writer-girlfriend while she is traveling abroad and comes back to discover him en flagrance. But this is nothing to worry about and it's done melodramatically and even tastefully, like something out of a 19th century romantic novel.

The crone with tarot cards who foretells the violin's story looks like a character from The Princess Bride or a child's fairy tale. An episode involving Greta Scacchi as a seductive novelist who warms up a long-haired English virtuoso before his performances makes one giggle and triggers a desire to shout, ""Watch out for that bow!""But the director more than compensates for this by infusing the sort of visual splendor that rewards a discerning viewer with several captivating strands of the story that unfold only with ongoing consideration.

Even some of my favorite movies require me to overlook quite a few such moments.The Red Violin is perfect on that account!  Such incredible attention to detail was lavished on this movie, it is about as perfect as the Red Violin it portrays.  And let's get that straight right from the start.  This movie is about a Red Violin not the people used so elegantly to develop the character of the violin.  And I think it is a real testament to the brilliance of this movie that the entire supporting cast of actors can so fully develop an inanimate object.  The whole gist of the story is that a magnificent violin is born hundreds of years ago.  We are then on a magic carpet ride as we follow the great events of this perfect violin through the ages to the present.  That's it.  That is really all this movie is about.  Who would have thought that such a simple story could be so interesting, so engaging, so thoroughly original, and so uniquely told.The unique way in which the story is revealed is another tool utilized to make this story so fantastic.  This is high story telling at its best.  The auction for example, is rerun continually as we learn more and more about the Violin.  Each time, though, we glimpse a little more of the auction as we glimpse more of the soul of the Red Violin.  Combining with this, we jump repeatedly from the auction, to the birth of the violin, to the different phases of the Violin's life, and to the Violin's Tarot reading.  The effect is totally engaging and refreshing.  Bravo.The production values of this movie are top notch; the acting is magnificent, the photography stunning, and the music a feast for the ears.  The slavish attention to details adds to all of this and causes a total suspension of disbelief.The DVD edition of the movie is Anamorphic Widescreen.  On a regular TV the characters will look slightly skinny.  However, on a widescreen TV you will be blown away by the copious panoramic vistas that can only be truly appreciated in their widescreen glory.  This DVD lacks any of the usual goodies such as the Making of the Red Violin etc.  This is really a shame because I would have loved to learn more about the scores, the musicians who played them and the composer who created them.Overall, this movie is one of those incredibly rare gems that are flawless.

Since I am not a musician, I didn't quite understood the infatuation that the characters developed for the violin: it seemed exaggerated, and often comical to me.  However, the stories themselves were great- at times touching and sad, at times joyful and uplifting, and quite often hilarious.There is the story of the creator, who, upon his wife's death, infuses the violin with his wife's body and soul.  There is the young prot&eacute;g&eacute;e who dies just before his discovery.  There is the mad genius who gains musical inspiration from his lust.  There is the secret music lover and her sacrifice for the love of her family and country.  Finally, there is the violin expert who recognizes its worth and finds that it is what he has been searching for for his whole life.The stories of the violin's owners are weaved together with the story of the violin's auction, which is quite thrilling.  The descendants of all previous owners are all there: each MUST have it- who will win?However, the ultimate ending was disappointing, and in my opinion, extremely unrealistic- there is no way that such an event could have happened at such a high level auction selling such valuable items (watch the movie and you will understand what I mean).Warning: the movie is taken in multiple languages.

And those five cards, along with an auction in 20th century Montreal, provide the framework for the tale that is about to unfold: The Moon - a long life, full and rich, and a long voyage. But there is a curse over her, Cesca tells her mistress as she turns the second card; there is danger to all who are under her thrall, and there will be many ... indeed, the Hanged Man is a powerful card! Then there will be a time of lust and energy, her Lazarus soul will travel across mountains, oceans and time, and she will meet a handsome and intelligent man who will seduce her with his talents ""and worse"" - in short, the Devil. The fourth card Anna has drawn is Justice: There will be a big trial before a powerful magistrate, Cesca tells her; she will be found guilty ... ""beware the heat of the fire!"" And indeed, the last card that Anna turns, much to her alarm, is Death - but the card is upside down and Cesca tells her not to worry because at this point this might be good news: She will be carried by the air and furious wind, but then her voyage will come to an end, ""one way or another."" There is ""trouble"" in this, Cesca says, ""but you are strong now, like a tree in a forest."" She will also not be alone; the servant sees a crowd of faces ... friends, family, enemies, lovers and a lot of admirers fighting to win her hand (lots of money, too) - and ultimately, a rebirth.Each card symbolizes one of the stories told about the travels through time and space made by the Red Violin, Niccol&ograve; Busotti's last masterpiece, over the course of the centuries. And each of the violin's owners we meet symbolizes a stage of life: birth, childhood, coming of age, political awakening and maturity. In that, it is not so much the violin's voyage that links the five vignettes dealing with its owners' lives, such as Glenn Gould's life provided the links between the individual parts of writer-director Francois Girard's first film, ""32 Short Films About Glenn Gould."" Rather, the humans' stories provide snapshots of various stages of the instrument's existence, brought to life by John Corigliano's magnificent and Oscar-winning score and Joshua Bell's virtuoso performance - and of course, it is also obvious throughout that a link exists between Anna Busotti and the violin created by her husband.""The Red Violin"" is feast for the eyes and ears - luscious and true to detail in its costume design and cinematography, it not only faithfully uses the original languages of its various locations but also actors who are native speakers (to the point of having Suisse-born actor Jean Luc Bideau portray the French teacher of Austrian wunderkind Kaspar Weiss [Christopher Koncz], thus choosing an actor who is on the one hand fluent in German but on the other hand speaks it with a ""genuine"" French accent ... and although I don't speak any Chinese/Mandarin, I wouldn't be surprised if the scenes taking place in China were linguistically as faithful to their location as those set in Vienna and elsewhere).So why only four stars, not five? Because, as others have noted, the movie's plot lines fall somewhat short of its visual and acoustic splendor. Granted, there was only limited possibility to develop meaningful stories for each of the vignettes. But given the highly symbolic nature of the movie's five parts, too many gaping holes remain. Although we know the violin's story doesn't end with Kaspar, for example, we can only guess as to how it falls into the hands of gypsies. And the following sequence, involving British composer and virtuoso Frederick Pope and his mistress Victoria Byrd, has rightfully been criticized for the shallow waters it treads: Even if you don't have a whole movie to develop the relationship between a sensual, gifted and somewhat eccentric composer and his novelist lover (such as 1991's magnificent and in the U.S. sadly overlooked ""Impromptu""), and even if Greta Scacchi's Victoria is far from being another George Sand, her talent seems ... well, maybe not wasted, but reduced to another ""blonde bombshell"" role unworthy of her Old Vic training. And don't even get me started on the final scene in Montreal and the ""conflict"" faced by violin appraiser Charles Morritz ... (although Samuel L. Jackson, at least, gives a finely tuned and sensitive performance which almost manages to smooth out the edges of the script's sometimes scratchy composition.)But this movie's real star and ultimately, its saving grace, is the Red Violin itself - not the six models physically representing the instrument throughout the film of course, but the personality it gains through Corigliano's score and its uniquely beautiful interpretation by Bell, and the idea the violin stands for; that of music's everlasting magic. For bringing this idea to life alone, the movie is well worth seeing.Also recommended:Amadeus - Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)Immortal BelovedImpromptu",4,A feast for the senses ... and

I love violin music and the violin itself, and have a special interest in its history, construction, varnishes, audio spectral analysis, etc. I'm also a fan of the Tarot, so I thought a big treat was in store.Promise galore- the film is gorgeous to look at- the costumes, settings, historical details are amazing.  There is virtuoso playing peppered here and there.  The beginning is auspicious, intriguing, compelling, but it's downhill from there.  I'd say if you don't read the reviews and have every detail of the mysteries of the violin's origin and what becomes of it RUINED, you may enjoy those aspects- UNLESS- sorrow, regret, betrayal, avarice, obsession, jealousy, dishonesty, deceit- the worst of human experience and human nature- are unpalatable to you in large doses.  I would have liked to have been inspired by tales featuring admirable human traits, celebrating the musical heights humans can achieve, for example, or the qualities that are BEST in us, at least one or two.  And, apart from the disagreeable subject matter and outcomes, just as you're beginning to get some idea of what a character's about or mildly interested, their segment ends!  For me, a pretty package with little inside, a disappointing wet blanket of a film.  Uninspiring, but thought-provoking, I'll give it that.And I'd add (without giving away the ending) that with just a little thought, the writer could've made the film GREAT by having it end in such a way that the circle was complete, desires/ intentions, hopes, dreams, unfulfilled in the beginning (and throughout), were fulfilled, at long last, in the end.  How satisfying that would have been.  (I just realized when writing this that this was the theme ofThe Lake House, one reason I liked it so much.)  Indeed, such issues are at the heart of Tarot, cards such as Justice, and The Universe, have to do with wrongs being naturally righted, redemption, things coming full circle.  There was just the faintest hint of that, but it was done by such unsavory, illicit means as to negate it entirely, just more of the same.  Such a missed opportunity.P.S.

The uncompressed digital soundtrack will almost make you jump off your seat in certain scenes.The film is refreshing in the way it makes the viewer figure out its plot by embedding subtle but important plot details into many scenes, which are replayed at various times through different perspectives.  This is skillfully done to avoid putting off viewers by confusing them.  This is also adds to the impact of the storytelling unlike most current films, which hand you simple plots as if you don't have the ability to think.  This was the first time I have watched a movie using this screenplay technique without feeling frustrated.But make no mistake.  You would have to intently watch the movie from beginning to end without interruptions.  Otherwise, you would almost certainly become confused and frustrated.The movie takes viewers throughout a cursed violin's journey through many countries over the course of several centuries.

And the strongest emotion shown is the longing of a lost love and what it means to find it again.

You'll need patience in watching this movie, in order to let the love affair develop and climax.

515855,A2HE4RHOGMWDV8,B000031WD7,Young Kim,"[15, 19]","The Red Violin is a movie, which like the title violin, that is made in  the classic mold.  It tells the tales of diverse characters, tied together  in life (and often death) by a magnificent violin made by a 17th century  Italian artisan.  The violin in question, painted red, was to be a gift to  the violin maker's unborn son.  However, as fate would have it, the child  is stillborn.The movie is beautifully bookended by its creation at the  hands of the Italian master, and the chapters are marked by a gypsy fortune  teller.  The pace is perfect: the movie can show the audience the quick  passage of time with incredible grace (a orchestra of orphan violinists and  a series of gypy violin players are two incredibly effective sequences), as  well as slow down and focus on major characters when necessary.  Time is  also a tool to tell the tale that occurs in the present, and the audience  sees the same scene from different angles and points-of-view, opening  layers and layers as the plot thickens.I won't reveal the plots.  There  is a main plot that takes place in the present, a mystery in the past, and  three lives in the middle, which makes for a lot of story telling, but is  beautifully carried out by the filmaker.  If only more movies were like  this one, a movie that is not afraid to throw surprises a the audience, a  movie that does not spell out every angle and plot development, a movie  that does not telegraph every action.  The audience is invited to watch, to  learn, and to try to follow the history of this rich instrument.The  movie only fails to attain five stars because of my personal dislike of the  ending.  The ending is not false to the movie and the characters, and as  such, is understandable, but for me it was not worthy of the moral history  of the violin.  Nevertheless, this is a truly marvelous film that everyone  who loves to watch movies, listen to beautiful music, and to see wondrous  sights should definitely watch.",4,Wondrous tale of a &quot;perfect violin.&quot;,966297600,"08 15, 2000",2000,1970,"['Red', 'Violin', 'movie', 'title', 'violin', 'made', 'classic', 'mold', 'tales', 'diverse', 'characters', 'tied', 'together', 'life', 'often', 'death', 'magnificent', 'violin', 'made', '17th', 'century', 'Italian', 'artisan', 'violin', 'question', 'painted', 'red', 'was', 'be', 'gift', 'violin', 'maker', 'unborn', 'son', 'However', 'fate', 'would', 'have', 'child', 'stillborn.The', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'bookended', 'creation', 'hands', 'Italian', 'master', 'chapters', 'are', 'marked', 'gypsy', 'fortune', 'teller', 'pace', 'perfect', 'movie', 'can', 'show', 'audience', 'quick', 'passage', 'time', 'incredible', 'grace', 'orchestra', 'orphan', 'violinists', 'series', 'gypy', 'violin', 'players', 'are', 'two', 'incredibly', 'effective', 'sequences', 'as', 'well', 'slow', 'down', 'focus', 'major', 'characters', 'when', 'necessary', 'Time', 'also', 'tool', 'tell', 'tale', 'present', 'audience', 'same', 'scene', 'different', 'angles', 'points-of-view', 'opening', 'layers', 'layers', 'plot', 'thickens.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'plots', 'main', 'plot', 'place', 'present', 'mystery', 'past', 'three', 'lives', 'middle', 'lot', 'story', 'telling', 'beautifully', 'carried', 'out', 'filmaker', 'only', 'more', 'movies', 'were', 'one', 'movie', 'not', 'afraid', 'throw', 'surprises', 'audience', 'movie', 'not', 'spell', 'out', 'angle', 'plot', 'development', 'movie', 'not', 'telegraph', 'action', 'audience', 'invited', 'watch', 'learn', 'try', 'follow', 'history', 'rich', 'instrument.The', 'movie', 'only', 'attain', 'five', 'stars', 'personal', 'dislike', 'ending', 'ending', 'not', 'false', 'movie', 'characters', 'such', 'understandable', 'was', 'not', 'worthy', 'moral', 'history', 'violin', 'Nevertheless', 'truly', 'marvelous', 'film', 'everyone', 'who', 'watch', 'movies', 'listen', 'beautiful', 'music', 'see', 'wondrous', 'sights', 'should', 'definitely', 'watch']",N/A
