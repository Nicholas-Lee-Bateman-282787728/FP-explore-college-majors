But always well informed about these extremely endangered Great Apes, so near to humans in intelligence and all our human feelings and yearnings.  One of the most amazing things is how unique and individual each featured orangutan is - again, like humans.Another thing that strikes me about orangutans and other Great Apes, is their tremendous love for their children.  You never see a mother abuse her baby - just gently removing a little hand reaching for the wrong plant, or needing help navigating branches. Humans could learn a lot from them.I already owned this DVD, but bought a second as a gift.  I know the recipient will enjoy and treasure it as much as I do.",5,"Orangutan Island, DVD",1402272000,"06 9, 2014",2014,747,"['TV', 'series', 'DVD', 'will', 'have', 'smiling', 'sometimes', 'teary-eyed', 'always', 'well', 'informed', 'extremely', 'endangered', 'Great', 'Apes', 'so', 'humans', 'intelligence', 'human', 'feelings', 'yearnings', 'One', 'most', 'amazing', 'things', 'how', 'unique', 'individual', 'featured', 'orangutan', 'again', 'thing', 'orangutans', 'other', 'Great', 'Apes', 'tremendous', 'love', 'children', 'never', 'see', 'mother', 'baby', 'just', 'gently', 'removing', 'little', 'hand', 'reaching', 'wrong', 'plant', 'needing', 'help', 'navigating', 'branches', 'Humans', 'could', 'learn', 'lot', 'them.I', 'already', 'owned', 'DVD', 'bought', 'second', 'gift', 'know', 'recipient', 'will', 'enjoy', 'treasure', 'as', 'much', 'do']",Orangutan Island - Season 1

I can't get enough of it.Very addictive. Enjoy starting my day with Jordan, Hamlet, Milo, sheriff Daisey, Chen Chen, Cha Cha, & all the rest. Didn't know much about Orangutans or their plight until I started watching the show. To bad animal planet cancelled it.
