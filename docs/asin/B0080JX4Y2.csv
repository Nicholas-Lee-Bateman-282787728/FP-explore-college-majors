Released in 2012, the movie follows the trials, tribulations and exploitation of young aspiring good looking lead man (Adam), who intends (like many) to make it big in Hollywood.  It's generally a fun film, with a decent collection of characters sure to garner some laughs (including Judy TenutaBuy This Again Pigsand Bruce Vilanch).  It's not all fun and games by no means, as Adam hooks up (for lack of better terms) with a drug-addicted guy and indeed bares it all for the camera to make a few bucks.In the end however, it's fun, and spirited and won't leave you depressed and angry at the end. I enjoyed all aspects of the production for the lead and supporting actors, the direction and production. It's a bizarre mix of Ugly Betty,Queer as Folk - The Complete Seriesand a porn film.While the soundtrack does not feature big name stars (thankfully in most cases), it does include Josh ZuckermanOut From Underand the title track by Sirpaul (which should be a hit on the dance floor).

Acting is stiff and so obviously posed.  Very plastic dehumanized and unbelievable characters.  I was not really convinced of a single emotion portrayed.  Absolutely nothing original about the script. Could have been assembled from any number of other similar paper novels. No surprises in either plot or directing.  Humdrum unexciting unfolding of a predictable humdrum plot with humdrum acting in unexciting sets and locations.  Nothing very sexual as the situations were not all that believable.  On the plus side the body shots were nice even though the makeup was obvious.  Some of the actors do a fairly good job in some of the cuts but struggle to be very convincing with the corny dialog.

The director's main interest seems to be the lead actor's nipples -- I kid you not. They are perky and nice, but unfortunately, this is not enough to sustain my attention over 2 hours. The writing is at times embarrassingly bad. There are lame attempts at humor (the lead's friend and her 'slave'), lame attempts at Hollywood insider gossip (the awkward David Geffen character), and lame attempts at exposing the porn industry (yuck is the way to sum it up).The funniest part isn't meant to be funny -- it involves a boyfriend/porn director with an addiction that you can sense coming a mile away.  He has a really bad pencil shave and a reptilian stare that makes you legitimately wonder how Mr. Perky Nipples would ever have fallen for this lizard. When he hits bottom (pardon pun) it's like a scene from a zombie film.  But it is played as serious social commentary, so it is spectacularly bad. Oh how I yearned for some John Waters satire...There are some redeeming qualities to the film. Despite the sense that this is an amateur production, the main actors are all professional and doing their best to make it work somehow. It is endearing to see how hard they try, and I found myself wondering wistfully if we will ever hear from them again.  And heck, there is some self respect towards the end if you make it that far.  At least there were no suicides.Will gay films always be the equivalent of the gay rainbow flag - cheap, poorly designed, and ugly?  Will the genre ever grow up, and deliver more depth and better quality?  One has to wonder if the vapid memes of modern gay culture (paper thin superficiality, drugs, gossip, porn addictions, etc.) consign gay films to the trash heap of cinema.

But, I don't think it was a good movie. The narrative is belabored by too many inconsequential subplots and incidental characters.  The juxtaposition between humor and drama is clumsy and ruined the impact of both elements.Actor Matthew Ludwinski lacks the acting chops to play Adam with any nuance or depth so the character comes off as an effete pretty face. (Not that there's anything wrong with that.)The character's transition into prostitution, falling in love with a drug addict to being with John the charming, handsome but closeted Television star (well played by Michael Medico)comes across too incidentally and contrived.John pays for his gay sex with hot model types so he would have crossed paths with guys like Adam many many times. The motivations and outcomes are far too shallow given the filmmakers obvious intention to express gravity with the choices the characters are faced with. This thing ends so trite and unlikely; purely the stuff of fantasy for the shallowest of tweens who would find the sub plots of drug addictions and prostitution edgy.(I imagine I would have LOVED this when I was 15!

His character studies of how these individuals react to circumstances beyond their control, or dangerously outside their comfort zone are always fasccinating to watch.  This movie is no different.  These are people you know, live next door to, are friends with, or maybe they could be you!  And Casper writes tales that make you care about what happens to his characters...you get to know them and are invested in the outcome.  He also knows how to splice humor into scenes otherwise filled with pathos.  And in this day and age, it is heart warming to find gay friendly films that aren't necessarily about being gay...this is a story of a young man whose life takes turns that he does not expect, and maybe, for which he is not prepared...and we root for him, and his friends to have that happy ending...and La La Land doesn't disappoint!

I sent him a message, first of all complimenting him on his performance...but I also told him about several personal things. Not even three day's later, I received a ""Message"" back. I'm hoping it was actually Michael, but even if not, it meant a lot to me. It was not a pre-written ""Thanks a lot"" letter. It was personalized, and addressed my hopes and dreams. That's class. Secondly, several days ago, I received a ""text"" from Embrem Entertainment and Casper Andreas, Thanking me for purchasing the film. How could I not. It was only after ""Net Flix"" recommended this movie that I even heard of it. I watched it. It's in my ""Instant Que"" and I now own it.It's an amazing film.

Then, Ang Lee bought Brokeback Mountain to the big screen. I admire the studio for taking on that project. The film was beautiful, sad...and emotionally draining.

It's a shame, but...at least I have ""Going Down..."", ""Latter Days"" and ""Brokeback Mountain.""

It contains the themes of love and sex which permeate his movies, but it also deals with our current society's obsession with fame and celebrity. Humor is present but it is a dark prickly (pun intended) humor.There are three standout performances.  One is the very handsome Matthew Ludwinski who is perfect as the aptly named Adam who moves to LA, is soon faced with many tempatations, and ends up dong porn.  He has the boy-next-door quality of Joey Stefano and a very expressive face and voice. The second is Allison Lane as Candy the best friend to Adam. She is great as the epitome of the celebrity seeker, and she provides comic relief with perfect timing. Third is Casper Andreas himself as the sleazy drug-addled Nick who seduces Adam into the porn business. Nick is a director who has been reduced to directing pornos. It is quite a change from the Casper we are used to seeing and showcases his range.The scene in the hospital after Adam overdoses thinking that his actions have ruined his life sums up the movie. Perez Hilton as the orderly Ricky comes into the room and tells Adam that his scandal has made him ths subject of the celebrity blogs.  Adam's first reaction is one of horror.  However, Ricky tells him that he thinks everthing about it is FABULOUS! Adam thanks him and manages a smile.The title of my review alludes to the two great movies on this theme.

(WARNING:  Beware those Gay video porn-mills!).  ....Ah, BUT, then come the very best parts, where we start to see...(well, you'll find that out, below).NOW TO OUR CAST:  And saving the best for last, here's a glimpse at the major characters...beginning with:- *Allison Lane, as the ditzy B(Girl)FF of the male Lead.  Named ""Candy"", she is the supportive and often funny--yet sometimes tiresome--friend from back home.  (Good for Allison...she gets more screen time than anyone other than our main star).- Next, in a major (time-wise) supporting role, we have the Director, himself:  Casper Andreas, playing a ""User"" of a guy, who we'll later see as the true scuzzball he becomes.  (This viewer thinks Andreas would do well, in future, spending all his time BEHIND the camera....for I'm starting to picture him as he appears in his last scene---or is that just effective acting?).- AND FINALLY:  Let's speak to that ""CHEMISTRY"" mentioned above.  RARELY, in an American produced Gay film, do we get to see such an emotionally deep relationship between two men.  It was obviously developed by main actor, Matthew Ludwinski (as our gorgeous ""Adam"") and his co-lead, Michael Medico (as sweet, but closeted, ""John"") during their shooting time with one another.  Their ""few"" scenes together will keep you RIVETED.  We can a..l...most Touch what they burn off the screen at us. (And there's the shame of this movie:  56 and one-half minutes into it before we even see this couple together--except for a ""prologue"" of sorts).  NEVERTHELESS, you tell me if the likes of this film relationship has been seen, in this country, since the days of ""Brokeback Mountain""!Oh, I had my doubts, well into this movie......but Matthew Ludwinski held me to it.",4,"No ""Chemistry"" like this, since.....",1344729600,"08 12, 2012",2012,2107,"['..', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', '*Alternate', 'title', 'review', 'Hear', 'Crabcakes', 'are', 'Excellent', '3.5', 'STARS', 'ARE', 'ACTUALLY', 'AWARDED', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'running', 'time', 'Going', 'Down', 'Blah-Blah', 'Land', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'meat', 'grinder', 'story', 'young', 'newbies', 'scrambling', 'foothold', 'arriving', 'world', 'film', 'capital', 'WARNING', 'Beware', 'Gay', 'video', 'porn-mills', '.Ah', 'BUT', 'then', 'come', 'very', 'best', 'parts', 'where', 'start', 'see', 'well', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', '.NOW', 'TO', 'OUR', 'CAST', 'saving', 'best', 'last', 'here', 'glimpse', 'major', 'characters', 'beginning', '*Allison', 'Lane', 'ditzy', 'B', 'Girl', 'FF', 'male', 'Lead', 'Named', 'Candy', 'supportive', 'often', 'funny', 'yet', 'sometimes', 'tiresome', 'friend', 'back', 'home', 'Good', 'Allison', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'anyone', 'other', 'main', 'star', '.-', 'Next', 'major', 'time-wise', 'supporting', 'role', 'have', 'Director', 'Casper', 'Andreas', 'playing', 'User', 'guy', 'who', ""'ll"", 'later', 'see', 'true', 'scuzzball', 'viewer', 'Andreas', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'future', 'spending', 'time', 'camera', '.for', ""'m"", 'starting', 'picture', 'last', 'scene', '-or', 'just', 'effective', 'acting', '.-', 'FINALLY', 'Let', 'speak', 'CHEMISTRY', 'mentioned', 'RARELY', 'American', 'produced', 'Gay', 'film', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'such', 'emotionally', 'deep', 'relationship', 'two', 'men', 'was', 'obviously', 'developed', 'main', 'actor', 'Matthew', 'Ludwinski', 'gorgeous', 'Adam', 'co-lead', 'Michael', 'Medico', 'sweet', 'closeted', 'John', 'shooting', 'time', 'one', 'few', 'scenes', 'together', 'will', 'keep', 'RIVETED', 'can', 'a..l', 'most', 'Touch', 'what', 'burn', 'screen', 'shame', 'movie', '56', 'one-half', 'minutes', 'even', 'see', 'couple', 'together', 'prologue', 'sorts', 'NEVERTHELESS', 'tell', 'likes', 'film', 'relationship', 'been', 'seen', 'country', 'days', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'Oh', 'had', 'doubts', 'well', 'movie', 'Matthew', 'Ludwinski', 'held']",Going Down in LA-LA Land

In the context of male-male relationships, I know just how tough it can be for us,gay men, so, the ""Pretty Woman"" type ending to this film colours it with the hue of a great gay fairy tale. Being the eternal realist, I didn't find the story-line entirely believable but I did think that the characters were - honest portrayals of gay men as we really are with no excuses and no apologies. The lead, Matthew Ludwinski, was stunning, not just in terms of his physical beauty but his tender portrayal of an impressionable Hollywood wannabe who's sexually confident yet emotionally vulnerable. Casper Andreas was equally stunning as the sexy, troubled Nick - his acting ability is only rivalled by his directorial talent and I am still awed by how he captured Nick's suffering, which is the suffering of too many gay men who've allowed happiness to slip through their fingers in exchange for a temporary high, so succinctly.

It's a wonderfully crafted story about a handsome young man who moves to Los Angeles in search of a TV or film acting career and gets so much more than he bargained for.  Being from Los Angeles myself, I can say the film is very accurate in its depiction of the seedy, depraved, nasty and drug-laden culture of the city.  I actually lived that culture much to my detriment many years ago until fate whisked me away to the midwest.  Anyway, this film is extremely well written, directed, shot and acted.

Once in a blue moon, gay movie gems would surface and I am glad to have recently discovered ""Going Down in LA-LA Land"" directed by Mr. Casper Andreas and starring Mr. Matthew Ludwinski. The movie concludes with a happy ending and chronicles the challenges and adversity of Adam (Ludwinski) following his dreams and heart of being an actor in Los Angeles. The plot isn't original and I would have enjoyed the movie more had they not include the gossip columnist, Mr. Mario Armando Lavandeira, Jr. (alias ""Perez Hilton"") in a scene near the conclusion of the movie. What gravitated me towards the movie was the journey Adam chose to undertake for the sake of following his heart.""Going Down in LA-LA Land"" explores the adult entertainment industry as the black, kiss of death with the potential to terminate any aspiring actor's career or an alternative, rear entry into the glitz and glamour that is Hollywood, where you are likely to be cast based on association. How far are you willing to go at finding and connecting with the power players? The cinematography and script isn't anywhere close to Ang Lee's ""Brokeback Mountain"" (for obviously financial resources). Mr. Andreas managed to enlist the help from burgeoning model and actor, Mr. Matthew Ludwinski. It was a delightful cast to see Mr. Ludwinski in a movie. Models transitioning to acting is like watching paint dry. Or I would rather chew cardboard or have my tooth pulled out without any local anesthetic, than watching lifeless actors delivering boring lines!Mr. Matthew Ludwinski delivered a great performance as Adam and his portrayal of Adam won me. While watching the movie, I was saying, ""NO! Don't do that Adam. Don't lose yourself!"" Or ""Way to go Adam, stand up for your principles and beliefs."" I was cheering for Adam's success at reaching his dreams. I think that is the way Mr. Andreas intended--making a movie that reaches out and connecting the audience to Adam. With a handsome, debonair face and sexy body, Mr. Ludwinski is in the right city that's Los Angeles. I look forward to seeing him grow and mature professionally as an actor and model. In the mean time, I am going to find his other movies.Give ""Going Down in LA-LA Land"" a chance. Rent or stream it here on Amazon.com and share your own thoughts and feelings.

But it is simply so sweet & perfect for a romantic at heart like me. It helps a lot too that all the main characters are so beautiful to look and can act well. My favourite character is actually the zany girlfriend, Candy, who provides such an honest and funny view of how things work in Hollywood.

I am a big fan of independent movies and happy to support them in any way I can. La La Land is a well constructed film with a coherent story, great production values. and makes good use of the LA scene. The acting in the film is generally good and well meaning and the actors seem well suited to their roles. I had some trouble with a couple of areas, however. First, in too many independent gay-themed films, the line between drama and comedy is a little dodgy. Here, the role of Judy Tenuda was neither funny or interesting. It seemed to me to be a complete waste of time. The film would have better not to have her perform.Also, it was somewhat difficult for me to understand why Michael Medico (the tv star) was so smitten with Matthew Ludwinski (the porn star).  The character of Matthew was not fleshed out enough to see really what type of person he was, and what it was that so attracted, Michael, who seemed like a really good catch. Perhaps it was his looks and how good he was in the sack? Other than that, (or if only because of that), it seems to me that Michael would soon tire of Matthew and regret giving up everything to be with him.Many of the characters in the film seemed true to form however, especially the director's film descent into drug addiction, and the scatterbrained girl friend of Matthew.While, I won't keep this film in my permanent collection of film at present, I would recommend it to anyone as a good story, well acted and interesting to watch.",3,The director asked me to review this film,1345420800,"08 20, 2012",2012,1560,"['received', 'email', 'morning', 'asking', 'review', 'film', 'So', 'here', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'independent', 'movies', 'happy', 'support', 'way', 'can', 'La', 'La', 'Land', 'well', 'constructed', 'film', 'coherent', 'story', 'great', 'production', 'values', 'good', 'use', 'LA', 'scene', 'acting', 'film', 'generally', 'good', 'well', 'meaning', 'actors', 'seem', 'well', 'suited', 'roles', 'had', 'trouble', 'couple', 'areas', 'however', 'First', 'too', 'many', 'independent', 'gay-themed', 'films', 'line', 'drama', 'comedy', 'little', 'dodgy', 'Here', 'role', 'Judy', 'Tenuda', 'was', 'funny', 'interesting', 'seemed', 'be', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'better', 'not', 'have', 'perform.Also', 'was', 'somewhat', 'difficult', 'understand', 'why', 'Michael', 'Medico', 'tv', 'star', 'was', 'so', 'smitten', 'Matthew', 'Ludwinski', 'porn', 'star', 'character', 'Matthew', 'was', 'not', 'fleshed', 'out', 'enough', 'see', 'really', 'what', 'type', 'person', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'so', 'attracted', 'Michael', 'who', 'seemed', 'really', 'good', 'catch', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'looks', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'sack', 'Other', 'only', 'Michael', 'would', 'soon', 'tire', 'Matthew', 'regret', 'giving', 'up', 'everything', 'be', 'him.Many', 'characters', 'film', 'seemed', 'true', 'form', 'however', 'especially', 'director', 'film', 'descent', 'drug', 'addiction', 'scatterbrained', 'girl', 'friend', 'Matthew.While', 'wo', ""n't"", 'keep', 'film', 'permanent', 'collection', 'film', 'present', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'good', 'story', 'well', 'acted', 'interesting', 'watch']",Going Down in LA-LA Land

Young, ambitious and gay, Adam Zeller arrives from New York with the looks and talent to become a star but soon finds himself lost in a seamy (and steamy) underworld of gay porn and male prositution, dealing with down-and-out directors, washed up starlets, crystal meth addicts and the pretty boy Hollywood A lister. He struggles to find his way back to the road of stardom, bu first gets a first-hand education on the X-rated film industry and finds out what really goes on in the town's top talent agencies. But it's not long before he's reduced to working as a male prostitute, turning tricks with a billionaire businessman and getting a peek inside the closet of one of America's most beloved TV stars.
