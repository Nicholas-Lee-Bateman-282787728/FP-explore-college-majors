Appearently the hick and his girlfriend are sick of looking at the mongloids buttcrack. But he dies and his voodoo sister ressurects him back to life as a buttcrack zombie to seek revenge on the hick and his girlfriend. If anyone looks at his booty, they turn into zombies. So some priest goes nuts and kills them all and the voodoo chick.The movie doesn't really have too much zombie action or even zombies if it is what you are expecting. However the movie was very entertaining in it's own way even though I gave it 2 stars (they're TROMA, what'd you expect).

715238,A1V4UQ0XZXLCGC,B00006G8IU,Dyraks12,"[5, 7]","A few months back I stumbled upon a review for this movie, and thought to myself there is no way someone would actually make a movie about turning into a zombie if you stare at some dead hillbilly's buttcrack.  Boy was I wrong.Aside from that, I can tell you that there aren't many other movies that make me laugh BEFORE the dialogue actually begins.  That opening song ""very sexy man"" should have been the most requested song of 1999.  I mean how many other songs contain the line ""swing my hairy buttocks to and fro!""?Though this movie was made in 1999 Brian, Wade's roommate, dressed like it was 1984.  Go Billy Idol!  Well Wade is content to sit in his room and play Atari, from the music it sounded like Pole Position or Miner 249er.  But his buttcrack disgusts Annie, Brian's girlfriend, so Brian kills him by ""accidentally dropping the radio in the bathtub after Wade was almost assaulted by Brian's homosexual friend.  Along the way you meet other interesting individuals such as Preacher man Bob, who should have been shot 436,000 times for his idiocracy in this movie.  Then there is his sister, who by the way the borrowed from the set of Witches of Eastwick.  And finally perhaps the greatest actor of all time, Kris Arnold, the dude who actually plays two parts in the movie.  The guy in the Trans Am who threw a can at Wade for not pulling his pants up, and then the mourner at Wade's funeral who says ""A-men"" like a retard.  His other line ""was sup Baby"" actually made me cry I was laughing so hard.  If you've seen the movie you understand.So in conclusion, I am actually baffled at how this movie didn't beat out American Beauty for Best Picture, hey; I think it is a close rival to Citizen Kane.",5,Who is the genius who came up with this concept?,1112659200,"04 5, 2005",2005,1713,"['few', 'months', 'back', 'stumbled', 'upon', 'review', 'movie', 'thought', 'myself', 'way', 'someone', 'would', 'actually', 'make', 'movie', 'turning', 'zombie', 'stare', 'dead', 'hillbilly', 'buttcrack', 'Boy', 'was', 'wrong.Aside', 'can', 'tell', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'make', 'dialogue', 'actually', 'opening', 'song', 'very', 'sexy', 'man', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'requested', 'song', '1999', 'mean', 'how', 'many', 'other', 'songs', 'contain', 'line', 'swing', 'hairy', 'buttocks', 'fro', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1999', 'Brian', 'Wade', 'roommate', 'dressed', 'was', '1984', 'Go', 'Billy', 'Idol', 'Well', 'Wade', 'content', 'sit', 'room', 'play', 'Atari', 'music', 'sounded', 'Pole', 'Position', 'Miner', '249er', 'buttcrack', 'Annie', 'Brian', 'girlfriend', 'so', 'Brian', 'kills', 'accidentally', 'dropping', 'radio', 'bathtub', 'Wade', 'was', 'almost', 'assaulted', 'Brian', 'homosexual', 'friend', 'way', 'meet', 'other', 'interesting', 'individuals', 'such', 'Preacher', 'man', 'Bob', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'shot', '436,000', 'times', 'idiocracy', 'movie', 'Then', 'sister', 'who', 'way', 'borrowed', 'set', 'Witches', 'Eastwick', 'finally', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'actor', 'time', 'Kris', 'Arnold', 'dude', 'who', 'actually', 'two', 'parts', 'movie', 'guy', 'Trans', 'Am', 'who', 'threw', 'can', 'Wade', 'not', 'pulling', 'pants', 'up', 'then', 'mourner', 'Wade', 'funeral', 'who', 'A-men', 'retard', 'other', 'line', 'was', 'sup', 'Baby', 'actually', 'made', 'cry', 'was', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'understand.So', 'conclusion', 'am', 'actually', 'baffled', 'how', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'beat', 'out', 'American', 'Beauty', 'Best', 'Picture', 'hey', 'think', 'close', 'rival', 'Citizen', 'Kane']",Buttcrack

There is an evil redneck and girlfriend duo, who after Buttcrack dies are haunted by the Buttcrack zombie thanks to a voodoo priestess. If anyone sees the buttcrack of death, they will become a zombie, too (obviously). Eventually a priest gets involved and resolves everything back to some semblance of normality. Anyhow, I think I have all that right: honestly I was so bored I found it difficult to pay very close attention.I watched this movie somewhat against my will, so there exists a possibility that I was biased against it to begin with, but despite the entertaining title and premise (you have to admit that the concept of a buttcrack zombie is pretty funny) I didn't really find the film very funny or entertaining.
