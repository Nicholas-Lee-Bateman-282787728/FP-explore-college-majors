Firstly, if you feel like you've heard their material in other places, you have.  That's the only downside of these ""CCPs.""The few that shine to me is Stephen Lynch #2 (his most recent CCP, mainly on his Craig Machine tour, I guess), Nick Swardson (always makes me laugh, especially when he talks about his 6 year old pic behind him), and Patton Oswalt (just an odd ball of weirdness, but funny!).Like I said, the fact that all of these are uncensored add to the fun, but the only drawback is that the material is somewhat dated.

Salzenstein ""Style Editor""","[3, 4]","WARNING :: If you're easily offended by off-color jokes, spend too much time riding the P.C.-pony, or can't appreciate the occasional hilarious bout of toilet humor, stay away from this DVD. If you're a sophisticated, intelligent, and fun-loving person who likes a good laugh- perhaps at the expense of (insert name of any minority or innocent group of oppressed people here)- however, you'll love the Best of Comedy Central Presents II.Without fail one of the best television stations of all time, Comedy Central has changed the way we look at the world around us, all through the lens of humor. The network is a veritable hotbed of hilarity, bringing some of the best programming out there to our living rooms every day. With a lineup that includes South Park, The Daily Show with John Stewart (one of the hottest men on TV I might add), Reno 911!, and Sarah Silverman, it's surprising that I ever watch anything else on television (in fact I don't), let alone leave the house.And yet for all their amazing scripted programming, sometimes it's the simplest little shows that bring the most pleasure. Of course, I'm talking about stand-up.Comedy Central is known for their star stand-up comics, and the Best of Comedy Central Presents II brings that home with aplomb. The nearly 3-hour disc features Dave Attell, Mike Birbiglia, Frank Caliendo (love him on Mad TV!), Zach Galifianakis, Patton Oswalt, Brian Posehn, Stephen Lynch, and Nick Swardson taking on topics as diverse as grandmothers, teddy bears, concert etiquette, time-travel, and of course the battle of the sexes (and races, genders, sexual orientations, and various people with ""special needs""...). At times it's raunchy, raw, rude, and all around wrong.And that's exactly why we love it.This is comedy as it's meant to be seen- uncensored, unedited, un-`bleeped,' and, well, unless you're a prude, you'll love it.SPECIAL FEATURESThe only extras on this DVD are a trio of Quickies; essentially clips from The Daily Show, The Colbert Report, and Reno: 911!, as well as a set of trailers. Funny clips to be sure, but nothing really ""special."" That being said, this isn't a feature film, so what do you expect? Bloopers? Not so much.Final answer :: Buy it. It's hilarious.",4,It's raw... and we love it!,1221696000,"09 18, 2008",2008,2234,"['WARNING', ""'re"", 'easily', 'offended', 'off-color', 'jokes', 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'riding', 'P.C.-pony', 'ca', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'occasional', 'hilarious', 'bout', 'toilet', 'humor', 'stay', 'away', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'sophisticated', 'intelligent', 'fun-loving', 'person', 'who', 'good', 'laugh-', 'perhaps', 'expense', 'insert', 'name', 'minority', 'innocent', 'group', 'oppressed', 'people', 'here', 'however', ""'ll"", 'love', 'Best', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'Presents', 'II.Without', 'fail', 'one', 'best', 'television', 'stations', 'time', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'changed', 'way', 'look', 'world', 'lens', 'humor', 'network', 'veritable', 'hotbed', 'hilarity', 'bringing', 'best', 'programming', 'out', 'there', 'living', 'rooms', 'day', 'lineup', 'South', 'Park', 'Daily', 'Show', 'John', 'Stewart', 'one', 'hottest', 'men', 'TV', 'might', 'add', 'Reno', '911', 'Sarah', 'Silverman', 'surprising', 'ever', 'watch', 'anything', 'else', 'television', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'alone', 'leave', 'house.And', 'yet', 'amazing', 'scripted', 'programming', 'simplest', 'little', 'shows', 'bring', 'most', 'pleasure', 'course', ""'m"", 'talking', 'stand-up.Comedy', 'Central', 'known', 'star', 'stand-up', 'comics', 'Best', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'Presents', 'II', 'home', 'aplomb', 'nearly', '3-hour', 'disc', 'features', 'Dave', 'Attell', 'Mike', 'Birbiglia', 'Frank', 'Caliendo', 'love', 'Mad', 'TV', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'Brian', 'Posehn', 'Stephen', 'Lynch', 'Nick', 'Swardson', 'taking', 'topics', 'as', 'diverse', 'grandmothers', 'teddy', 'bears', 'concert', 'etiquette', 'time-travel', 'course', 'battle', 'sexes', 'races', 'genders', 'sexual', 'orientations', 'various', 'people', 'special', 'needs', 'times', 'raunchy', 'raw', 'rude', 'around', 'exactly', 'why', 'love', 'it.This', 'comedy', 'meant', 'be', 'seen-', 'uncensored', 'unedited', 'un-', 'bleeped', 'well', ""'re"", 'prude', ""'ll"", 'love', 'it.SPECIAL', 'FEATURESThe', 'only', 'DVD', 'are', 'trio', 'Quickies', 'essentially', 'Daily', 'Show', 'Colbert', 'Report', 'Reno', '911', 'as', 'well', 'set', 'trailers', 'Funny', 'clips', 'be', 'sure', 'nothing', 'really', 'special', 'being', 'said', ""n't"", 'feature', 'film', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'Bloopers', 'Not', 'much.Final', 'answer', 'Buy', 'hilarious']",The Best of Comedy Central Presents II: Uncensored
1163342,A2M7CLVA0KIHQF,B0019F030C,"J.S. Knapp ""ViperMan""","[2, 4]","I'm a huge stand-up comedy buff.  I love it.  And when I saw the next iteration of uncensored comics from Comedy Central, I grabbed it up quick.I'll give a quick run-down by comic:Dave Attell is frankly far too old to be telling this line of dirty jokes.  He comes across as a creepy, pathetic old man who's long outlived the youthful exuberance he tries to portray.  He's funny - don't get me wrong - but often times you find yourself laughing at HIM, not his jokes...Mike Birbiglia is the opposite in every way.  Mike has a real soft spoken approach to comedy.  He's very clean - could pass for religious comedy - and is probably the most enjoyable comic on the disc.  Don't get me wrong - I'm not offended by lewd humor or language - I just think it takes skill to do it properly.  Birbiglia avoids it altogether.  In many ways he comes across as somewhat sterile, especially when compared to the other comics on this disc, but he's still funny in his own right, and that's okay with me.Daniel Tosh is one of those guys who I imagine most people are pretty polar over - they love him or hate him (or in the words of the late Mitch Hedburg, ""think he's O.K..."")  I enjoy him, though you really have to approach him with an open mind.  He can range anywhere from downright insulting to surprisingly self-loathing, and you never know how a joke will end-up.  He's a little raw, but in general he's pretty funny - and often hard to argue with!Frank Caliendo is pretty well known and he's pretty funny here, except that a handful of his references and impersonations come from movies or other content which I'm unfamiliar with.  So whereas some of his jokes will have you shooting milk from your nose, others become yawners simply because you don't know who he's talking about.  It's a fantastic finish however, with a reference that any Chris Farley fan will hurt themselves laughing over.Zach Galifianakis has three funny jokes in his entire repertoire.  One is regarding his brother and a Ford Focus, the other regarding Zach's appearance and Chucky Cheese, and the last regarding a sister with multiple personalities.  Two of those jokes are present here.  (One of these two as well as the other are on his Live at the Purple Onion DVD...)  Other than that, Zach just simply isn't funny.  I'm actually often offended by Zach - not by the content of his jokes, but the pathetic way in which he delivers them in an effort to be funny simply by slinging around swear words.  In a nutshell, he sucks, and I regret the money I've wasted on him.I'm a pretty solid Stephen Lynch fan - his first Comedy Central appearance was hilarious - enough so that I actually learned a few of his songs on guitar, and my college A Capella group even performed one or two of his songs.  This performance is much more dark, and - if censored, becomes nothing more than a beep-a-palooza.  He's funny, but it's not something you can share with your parents or younger children.  I missed his satirical and unexpected humor of the first performance, and ultimately felt disappointed with this one.Nick Swardson also appears in his second for-DVD appearance.  Much like Stephen's, it's funny without reaching the quality of the first.  In fact, judging from his ""Seriously: Who Farted"" curse-fest, it seems that Swardson is in a serious downhill trend...  His performance overall is forgettable - in fact I can't remember any of his jokes as I type this...And lastly, Patton Oswalt.  Patton is a unique comic.  He uses what I call a snowball approach - starting off with a nugget of an idea and then just throwing it mercilessly downhill to see what it turns into before slamming it into a heavily populated area...  Sometimes it pays off with a glorious arrival to hilarity in a way that's forever memorable.  Other times it just spirals out of control and leaves you - and most of his audience - feeling oddly uncomfortable.  He - like Caliendo - also uses several references which are often unfamiliar and ruin the validity of the entire joke - or snowball - whichever the case may be.What you end up with overall is a hum-drum DVD that fails to inspire.  The few shining moments aren't worth the dull ones, and whereas most of my Stand-up DVD's enjoy MANY repeated playthroughs, this one will undoubtedly collect dust.",3,Not as good as the first...,1264982400,"02 1, 2010",2010,4298,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'buff', 'love', 'when', 'saw', 'next', 'iteration', 'uncensored', 'comics', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'grabbed', 'up', 'quick.I', ""'ll"", 'give', 'quick', 'run-down', 'comic', 'Dave', 'Attell', 'frankly', 'far', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'telling', 'line', 'dirty', 'jokes', 'across', 'creepy', 'pathetic', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'long', 'outlived', 'youthful', 'exuberance', 'portray', 'funny', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'often', 'times', 'find', 'laughing', 'HIM', 'not', 'jokes', 'Mike', 'Birbiglia', 'opposite', 'way', 'Mike', 'real', 'soft', 'spoken', 'approach', 'comedy', 'very', 'clean', 'could', 'pass', 'religious', 'comedy', 'probably', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'comic', 'disc', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'not', 'offended', 'lewd', 'humor', 'language', 'just', 'think', 'skill', 'do', 'properly', 'Birbiglia', 'altogether', 'many', 'ways', 'somewhat', 'sterile', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'other', 'comics', 'disc', 'still', 'funny', 'own', 'right', 'okay', 'me.Daniel', 'Tosh', 'one', 'guys', 'who', 'imagine', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'pretty', 'polar', 'love', 'hate', 'words', 'late', 'Mitch', 'Hedburg', 'think', 'enjoy', 'really', 'have', 'approach', 'open', 'mind', 'can', 'range', 'anywhere', 'downright', 'insulting', 'surprisingly', 'self-loathing', 'never', 'know', 'how', 'joke', 'will', 'end-up', 'little', 'raw', 'general', 'pretty', 'funny', 'often', 'hard', 'argue', 'Frank', 'Caliendo', 'pretty', 'well', 'known', 'pretty', 'funny', 'here', 'handful', 'references', 'impersonations', 'come', 'movies', 'other', 'content', ""'m"", 'unfamiliar', 'So', 'whereas', 'jokes', 'will', 'have', 'shooting', 'milk', 'nose', 'others', 'become', 'yawners', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'talking', 'fantastic', 'finish', 'however', 'reference', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'fan', 'will', 'hurt', 'laughing', 'over.Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'three', 'funny', 'jokes', 'entire', 'repertoire', 'One', 'regarding', 'brother', 'Ford', 'Focus', 'other', 'regarding', 'Zach', 'appearance', 'Chucky', 'Cheese', 'last', 'regarding', 'sister', 'multiple', 'personalities', 'Two', 'jokes', 'are', 'present', 'here', 'One', 'two', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'are', 'Live', 'Purple', 'Onion', 'DVD', 'Other', 'Zach', 'just', 'simply', ""n't"", 'funny', ""'m"", 'actually', 'often', 'offended', 'Zach', 'not', 'content', 'jokes', 'pathetic', 'way', 'effort', 'be', 'funny', 'simply', 'slinging', 'around', 'swear', 'words', 'nutshell', 'regret', 'money', ""'ve"", 'wasted', 'him.I', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'solid', 'Stephen', 'Lynch', 'fan', 'first', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'appearance', 'was', 'hilarious', 'enough', 'actually', 'learned', 'few', 'songs', 'guitar', 'college', 'A', 'Capella', 'group', 'even', 'performed', 'one', 'two', 'songs', 'performance', 'much', 'more', 'dark', 'censored', 'nothing', 'more', 'beep-a-palooza', 'funny', 'not', 'something', 'can', 'share', 'parents', 'younger', 'children', 'missed', 'satirical', 'unexpected', 'humor', 'first', 'performance', 'ultimately', 'felt', 'disappointed', 'one.Nick', 'Swardson', 'also', 'second', 'for-DVD', 'appearance', 'Much', 'Stephen', 'funny', 'reaching', 'quality', 'first', 'fact', 'judging', 'Seriously', 'Who', 'Farted', 'curse-fest', 'Swardson', 'serious', 'downhill', 'trend', 'performance', 'overall', 'forgettable', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'jokes', 'type', 'lastly', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'Patton', 'unique', 'comic', 'what', 'call', 'snowball', 'approach', 'starting', 'off', 'nugget', 'idea', 'then', 'just', 'throwing', 'mercilessly', 'see', 'what', 'slamming', 'heavily', 'populated', 'area', 'glorious', 'arrival', 'hilarity', 'way', 'forever', 'memorable', 'Other', 'times', 'just', 'control', 'most', 'audience', 'feeling', 'oddly', 'uncomfortable', 'Caliendo', 'also', 'several', 'references', 'are', 'often', 'unfamiliar', 'ruin', 'validity', 'entire', 'joke', 'snowball', 'case', 'may', 'be.What', 'end', 'up', 'overall', 'hum-drum', 'DVD', 'inspire', 'few', 'shining', 'moments', 'are', ""n't"", 'dull', 'ones', 'most', 'Stand-up', 'DVD', 'enjoy', 'MANY', 'repeated', 'playthroughs', 'one', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'collect', 'dust']",The Best of Comedy Central Presents II: Uncensored
