961889,AY12DBB0U420B,B000CRR3SI,Gary Peterson,"[5, 6]","My wife and I had been watching ""Murder, She Wrote"" as late-night programming and we  enjoyed it very much through the first and second season. Then we took a break. Later we came back and resumed Season Three.It's a good series. It's easy and enjoyable watching and the plots take twists and turns that are sometimes hard to follow. Now and then we have it figured out before the end of the program. In any case, it's a good thing to watch late at night. It's light entertainment and is not too thought provoking. It's very interesting to look back on the 80s, almost like a period movie. In this particular season, it's been enjoyable to spot all the actors we know from other places, and it's interesting to see them in their youth. My wife has spotted four ""Star Trek"" (various series) actors and a couple from ""Big Love."" I've spotted a couple more known actors. It adds enjoyment to the viewing.It was our impression that Season One was somewhat better than Season Two, and it's now our impression that Season Three is back to Season One in quality and enjoyment. I'd say the violence, never very high, has been upped a bit in Season Three, but it falls  totally within acceptable limits, especially for a series that focuses on murder mysteries.Some people have complained about the recording of the DVD on both sides. It's a bit unusual, but we've had no problems with it. Also, there are complaints about the DVD quality. We have had no problems here either. The three complete seasons we have now watched on DVD have all functioned perfectly.Gary Peterson",5,Good Quality Programming.,1268265600,"03 11, 2010",2010,1565,"['wife', 'had', 'been', 'watching', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'late-night', 'programming', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'first', 'second', 'season', 'Then', 'took', 'break', 'Later', 'came', 'back', 'resumed', 'Season', 'Three.It', 'good', 'series', 'easy', 'enjoyable', 'watching', 'plots', 'take', 'twists', 'turns', 'are', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'follow', 'Now', 'then', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'end', 'program', 'case', 'good', 'thing', 'watch', 'late', 'night', 'light', 'entertainment', 'not', 'too', 'thought', 'provoking', 'very', 'interesting', 'look', 'back', '80s', 'almost', 'period', 'movie', 'particular', 'season', 'been', 'enjoyable', 'spot', 'actors', 'know', 'other', 'places', 'interesting', 'see', 'youth', 'wife', 'spotted', 'four', 'Star', 'Trek', 'various', 'series', 'actors', 'couple', 'Big', 'Love', ""'ve"", 'spotted', 'couple', 'more', 'known', 'actors', 'enjoyment', 'viewing.It', 'was', 'impression', 'Season', 'One', 'was', 'somewhat', 'better', 'Season', 'Two', 'now', 'impression', 'Season', 'Three', 'back', 'Season', 'One', 'quality', 'enjoyment', ""'d"", 'say', 'violence', 'never', 'very', 'high', 'been', 'upped', 'bit', 'Season', 'Three', 'totally', 'acceptable', 'limits', 'especially', 'series', 'murder', 'mysteries.Some', 'people', 'have', 'complained', 'recording', 'DVD', 'sides', 'bit', 'unusual', ""'ve"", 'had', 'problems', 'Also', 'are', 'complaints', 'DVD', 'quality', 'have', 'had', 'problems', 'here', 'either', 'three', 'complete', 'seasons', 'have', 'now', 'watched', 'DVD', 'have', 'functioned', 'perfectly.Gary', 'Peterson']","Murder, She Wrote: The Complete Third Season"

There are no big surprises in Season three of ""Murder She Wrote"", Jessica Fletcher continues doing what she does best and she does it well.There is the usual abundance of guest stars: highlights include George Clooney, Courtney Cox and Leslie Nielsen, as well as Tom Bosley and William Windom, reprising their roles as Sheriff Tupper and Doc Haslett, respectively. This season also includes the two ""Magnum P.I.""/ ""Murder She Wrote"" cross-over episodes (the first half of this double-episode was an episode of ""Magnum P.I."", which is included in this set as a special feature).

And my review is basically the same as it was with seasons one and two: just more mystery fun with Angela Lansbury as famed mystery author and crime solver Jessica Fletcher.Familiar faces from the little screen to the big screen stopped by for guest appearences in season three, including recent ""Syriana"" Oscar winner George Clooney, past Oscar winners Ernest Borgnine (""The Poseidon Adventure"") and Martin Balsam (""Psycho""), ""Friends"" alum Courtney Cox Arquette, ""Brady Bunch"" veterans Florence Henderson and Barry Williams, veteran comic Buddy Hackett, and ""Naked Gun"" star Leslie Nielsen. Other guest stars include: Gloria Stuart (""Titanic""), G.W. Bailey (""Police Academy""), Tess Harper (""Tender Mercies""), Jessica Walter (""Arrested Development""), Hayley Mills (""The Parent Trap""), Bill Macy (""Maude""), Genie Francis (""General Hospital""), Dinah Manoff (""Empty Nest""), and Harry Morgan (""M*A*S*H""). Three stars from the ""Star Trek"" TV shows turned up for guest appearences: George Takei (the original ""Star Trek"" series), LeVar Burton (""Star Trek: The Next Generation""), and Kate Mulgrew (""Star Trek: Voyager""). Erin Moran, best known for playing Joannie on the popular '70s sitcom ""Happy Days"", guest starred in the third episode of season three titled ""Unfinished Business"", which reunited her with ""Happy Days"" co-star Tom Bosley, who had a reoccuring role during the first couple of seasons of ""Murder, She Wrote"" as Amos Tupper, the sheriff of Jessica Fletcher's hometown of Cabot Cove, Maine (I've very much enjoyed Bosley's appearences on ""Murder, She Wrote"" as well as William Windom's reoccuring appearences as Cabot Cove doctor Seth Hazlitt). And in an interesting scenario, Tom Selleck and John Hillerman turn up in their ""Magnum P.I."" roles as part of a cross-over episode, with this particular storyline starting out on an episode of ""Magnum P.I."" (which was in its seventh season) and concluding with an episode of ""Murder, She Wrote"" (episode #8 to be exact). That episode of ""Magnum P.I."" is featured as a bonus on season three of ""Murder, She Wrote"".The ""Magnum P.I.""/""Murder, She Wrote"" cross-over episodes (titled ""Novel Connection"" and ""Magnum on Ice"") were a favorite of mine. Other great episodes from season three include: ""Death Stalks the Big Top"" parts 1 and 2, ""Unfinished Business"", ""Obituary For A Dead Anchor"", ""The Corpse Flew First Class"", ""Crossed Up"", ""Simon Says, Color Me Dead"", ""No Laughing Murder"", ""No Accounting For Murder"", and ""Murder, She Spoke"".""Murder, She Wrote"" season three is great fun for fans of mystery and crime, and Lansbury is wonderful as usual.

I have faithfully followed all the seasons, and Season Three [1986-87] is as entertaining as ever. I have to say that though I love all the locations for the stories, my favorite is Cabot Cove, Maine and I just adore the quirky townspeople and the scandals around them!In Season Three, we have some noted guest-stars such as Leslie Nielsen, Hayley Mills, Tom Selleck of Magnum P.I. fame, Bob Hastings, Eleanor Parker, Fritz Weaver, Shaun Cassidy, Ernest Borgnine, Tess Harper, a much younger George Clooney etc. With such talents abounding in each episode, its no wonder that watching this series is such a pleasure! The stories are creative and well-written, with a cohesive plotline and of course, stellar acting.Angela Lansbury s such a talented actress and continues to amaze till today [at 82!]. What I love most about her portrayal of J.B. Fletcher is that she plays a strong, intelligent, and attractive middle-aged lady [such roles are so scarce in Hollywood], and managed to entertain audiences for 12 years in her most-famous screen role! I hope the later seasons [9-12] will be made available on DVD soon!",5,Amazing Angela Lansbury as super-sleuth J.B.
