Outside of occasional aliasing, no other artifacts were visible. The animation is simple and clean. The audio is largely dynamic and enveloping.The extras, although enjoyable, are sparse and have been released previously.

Time well spent, as this is not only the greatest Spider-Man animated series of all time, not only the greatest Spider-Man adaptation of all time, but one of the greatest comic book adaptations of all time, period. It stands shoulder to shoulder with &#34;Batman the Animated Series&#34; and Joss Whedon's live action &#34;Avengers&#34; film, it's that good.I've watched this series a lot since it premiered, I owned the DVD's, I've seen it on Vortexx's website, but I've never seen it look this good. The lines were sharp, the colors vibrant... it was like seeing it again for the first time.A terrific re-imagining of Spider-Man's mythos. Spidey and Peter Parker are perfectly portrayed by Josh Keaton. Likewise, Lacey Chabert is great as Gwen Stacy; Vanessa Marshall is everything I ever wanted in Mary Jane Watson; Alan Rachins' Norman Osborn is a cold bastard and Steve Blum's Green Goblin is wonderfully psychotic and creepy. Every character is wonderful.I think Sony could learn a lot from this show as they continue to adapt Spidey to the big screen, and Marvel could learn a lot as they continue to publish the comics and adapt him to the small screen. This series was absolutely perfect. Sharp writing, top notch voice acting, breathtaking animation. The only thing I would change would be to add at least another three seasons.All twenty-six episodes are presented here in glorious hi-def, and we get three extras detailing the making of the show. If you're a Spidey fan of any kind, old or new; hardcore or casual, this is the series for you.",5,"Hands down, this IS Spider-Man",1398124800,"04 22, 2014",2014,1649,"['Well', 'just', 'spent', 'last', 'ten', 'hours', 'marathoning', '34', 'Spectacular', 'Spider-Man', '34', 'Blu-ray', 'Time', 'well', 'spent', 'not', 'only', 'greatest', 'Spider-Man', 'animated', 'series', 'time', 'not', 'only', 'greatest', 'Spider-Man', 'adaptation', 'time', 'one', 'greatest', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptations', 'time', 'period', 'shoulder', 'shoulder', '34', 'Batman', 'Animated', 'Series', '34', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'live', 'action', '34', 'Avengers', '34', 'film', 'good.I', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'series', 'lot', 'premiered', 'owned', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Vortexx', 'website', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'look', 'good', 'lines', 'were', 'sharp', 'colors', 'vibrant', 'was', 'seeing', 'again', 'first', 'time.A', 'terrific', 're-imagining', 'Spider-Man', 'mythos', 'Spidey', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'are', 'perfectly', 'portrayed', 'Josh', 'Keaton', 'Likewise', 'Lacey', 'Chabert', 'great', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'Vanessa', 'Marshall', 'everything', 'ever', 'wanted', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'Alan', 'Rachins', 'Norman', 'Osborn', 'cold', 'bastard', 'Steve', 'Blum', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'wonderfully', 'psychotic', 'creepy', 'character', 'wonderful.I', 'think', 'Sony', 'could', 'learn', 'lot', 'show', 'continue', 'adapt', 'Spidey', 'big', 'screen', 'Marvel', 'could', 'learn', 'lot', 'continue', 'publish', 'comics', 'small', 'screen', 'series', 'was', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'Sharp', 'writing', 'top', 'notch', 'voice', 'acting', 'breathtaking', 'animation', 'only', 'thing', 'would', 'change', 'would', 'be', 'add', 'least', 'three', 'seasons.All', 'twenty-six', 'episodes', 'are', 'presented', 'here', 'glorious', 'hi-def', 'get', 'three', 'extras', 'detailing', 'making', 'show', ""'re"", 'Spidey', 'fan', 'kind', 'old', 'new', 'hardcore', 'casual', 'series']",The Spectacular Spider-Man: The Complete Series
