492754,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000005XPV,A Customer,"[8, 8]","Made in 1959, Douglas Sirk's Imitation of Life is still just as evocative and as gorgeous to look today as it was almost 50 years ago. It's a real cinematic treat, shameless tearjerker, and an unabashed melodrama that dares to confront head-on issues of racism and the problems of motherhood at the stage when one's teenagers - in this case daughters--are growing up and preparing to enter the world.Lana Turner has never looked more ravishing as Lora Meredith, a young New York widow who will do anything to realize her dreams of Broadway stardom. Together with her young daughter Susie, they live in a squalid apartment eking out a hand-to-mouth existence, their futures fuelled by unfulfilled dreams.One day at Coney Island, Lora and Susie meet another a white girl Sarah Jane, who is being taken care of by a black woman, Annie Johnson (Juanita Moore), whom Lora mistakes for the maid.  When told by her that she's the mother, the surprised Lora falters but then accepts it without a question as if it were a natural thing that a black woman has a white child.The angelic and virtuous Annie asks Lora if she can come and help out around the apartment. Lora is initially hesitant - not because of Annie's race but because she's struggling and doesn't have any money to pay her a wage. Eventually, however, she relents and tells Annie that her and her daughter can stay for one night.At the same time, Lora meets the extremely fine-looking wannabe photographer, Steve Archer (John Gavin). Steve takes an instant liking to Lora and offers to marry her. But Lora is far too concerned with realizing her acting dreams to be stifled by a man and by marriage. Meanwhile, the saintly Annie is troubled that her daughter is ashamed of being black and tries to pass herself off in school as white.Imitation of Life follows these characters throughout their lives, with Sirk piling on the sentiment and melodrama every chance he can get.  Lora does indeed become a famous Broadway actress, yet neglects her growing daughter in the process. Steve goes on to become a president of a large photographic organization, but has trouble relating to Lora's need to be independent and famous.Annie's heart is eventually broken, gradually worn down by years of emotional abuse from her daughter. Sara Jane is so angry at being labeled as black that she repudiates her mother and ultimately runs away. Annie always stays the subservient and loyal maid; whilst her best friend and employer goes on to bask in a lush and international success. The contrast of the mother's compensations from their conflicting daughters is the story's ultimate paradox.Lora, Annie, Steve and the two girls seem to be victims of each other. They all want to follow their own dreams and forge their own paths in life even when it doesn't seem to be doing them much good. They are also surprisingly oblivious of how manipulated they are by the world around them.Lora gets her career but she's unlucky in love and terminally insecure as a mother, Whilst Sara Jane - perhaps the most damaged character - achieves her ambition to pass herself off as a white girl, but at great personal cost to both her and her aging mother.Under Douglas Sirk's accomplished direction, Miss Turner et al acts ornately and elaborately, everything is over emphasized to within an inch of its life, especially Lana's gorgeous outfits, yet the film - clocking in at over two hours - is always compelling and is never boring.The screenplay is sophisticated, the themes are brave and tempting and the look of the film - the brilliant surfaces, audacious colors, and the spatial complexities of 50s moderne architecture - bring to the forefront a bittersweet world of fantasy, entrapment, and emotional anxiety, and where the price of following one's dreams eventually comes at a harsh and desultory cost.

492756,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B000005XPV,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[1, 4]","With a fabulous cast and well paced direction by Douglas Sirk, this melodrama succeeds on many levels, and surpasses the 1934 version as tear-jerking entertainment. Lana Turner is marvelous as the struggling single mother who becomes a movie star, and leads a stellar cast, which includes a brilliant, moving performance from Juanita Moore, as Lana's servant as well as friend. It's Juanita who will use up most of your hankies, and she was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress for her work in this film (losing to Shelley Winters in ""The Diary of Anne Frank""), and also gets some of the best lines, like ""I'd rather be standin' with the lambs and not the goats on judgement day !""Also nominated for Best Supporting Actress was Susan Kohner, who plays Juanita's daughter, and gets to play a short but wrenching scene (and quite shocking for its time, as this film deals candidly with racial issues) with Troy Donahue. As Lana's daughter, Sandra Dee is wonderful, and shows how good she was as a dramatic actress in her big scene with Lana.Others in the cast include John Gavin as the man she loves, Dan O'Herlihy as playwright David Edwards, and Robert Alda as theatrical agent Allen Loomis.The high point in this film for me comes in one of its final scenes, with Mahalia Jackson's sublime rendition of ""Trouble of the World"".This adaptation of Fannie Hurst's novel was a huge box office hit, and was Sirk's last film (and one of a handful that he directed that did not star Rock Hudson), and it might also be his best. The cinematography by Russell Metty is rich and colorful, and Lana is gorgeous in a sumptuous array of Jean Louis gowns. This was Lana's first major production after the scandal that rocked Hollywood, the slaying of her lover by her daughter, and it was feared that the infamous event had damaged her career, but this film turned out to be one of her biggest successes, and also made her very wealthy, as she opted for 50% of the profits instead of a salary.Total running time is 124 minutes.",5,"glossy, entertaining melodrama",1115683200,"05 10, 2005",2005,2016,"['fabulous', 'cast', 'well', 'paced', 'direction', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'melodrama', 'many', 'levels', '1934', 'version', 'tear-jerking', 'entertainment', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'marvelous', 'struggling', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'movie', 'star', 'stellar', 'cast', 'brilliant', 'moving', 'performance', 'Juanita', 'Moore', 'Lana', 'servant', 'as', 'well', 'friend', 'Juanita', 'who', 'will', 'use', 'up', 'most', 'hankies', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'work', 'film', 'losing', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'Diary', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'also', 'best', 'lines', ""'d"", 'rather', 'be', 'standin', 'lambs', 'not', 'goats', 'judgement', 'day', 'Also', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'was', 'Susan', 'Kohner', 'who', 'Juanita', 'daughter', 'play', 'short', 'wrenching', 'scene', 'quite', 'shocking', 'time', 'film', 'deals', 'candidly', 'racial', 'issues', 'Troy', 'Donahue', 'Lana', 'daughter', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'wonderful', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'dramatic', 'actress', 'big', 'scene', 'Lana.Others', 'cast', 'include', 'John', 'Gavin', 'man', 'Dan', ""O'Herlihy"", 'playwright', 'David', 'Edwards', 'Robert', 'Alda', 'theatrical', 'agent', 'Allen', 'Loomis.The', 'high', 'point', 'film', 'one', 'final', 'scenes', 'Mahalia', 'Jackson', 'sublime', 'rendition', 'Trouble', 'World', '.This', 'adaptation', 'Fannie', 'Hurst', 'novel', 'was', 'huge', 'box', 'office', 'hit', 'was', 'Sirk', 'last', 'film', 'one', 'handful', 'directed', 'did', 'not', 'star', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'might', 'also', 'be', 'best', 'cinematography', 'Russell', 'Metty', 'rich', 'colorful', 'Lana', 'gorgeous', 'sumptuous', 'array', 'Jean', 'Louis', 'gowns', 'was', 'Lana', 'first', 'major', 'production', 'scandal', 'rocked', 'Hollywood', 'slaying', 'lover', 'daughter', 'was', 'feared', 'infamous', 'event', 'had', 'damaged', 'career', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'biggest', 'successes', 'also', 'made', 'very', 'wealthy', 'opted', '50', '%', 'profits', 'instead', 'salary.Total', 'running', 'time', '124', 'minutes']",Imitation of Life VHS

Her ability is played out in the role of an aging actress and mother-trying to balance her boyfriend and daughter with her desire for an illustrious career. The side line is actress Susan Kohner playing the reckless daughter who only wants to be rid of her origin-the fact that she is half black-half white. She breaks her mom's heart a little but still loves her. We feel for Susan's torn character, her mom's patient but heartbreaking rendition, Lora Meredith's fight for the best of both worlds, Sandra Dee's desire for her mother's time and affection, and John Gavin's wait for the love of his life, Lora Meredith (lana).It is the story of how simple family matters can tear people apart; it is the anatomy of important issues of our world today (or yesterday): racial prejudice, women working, young love, and the hearts of the faithful.BTW:Mahalia sings like no other at the end of this film, so anticipate hearing some mindblowing singing!WATCH AND ENJOY",5,"1 OF LANA'S BEST! ... cry,laugh,enjoy",1299196800,"03 4, 2011",2011,1075,"['Lana', 'get', 'flaunt', 'fact', 'not', 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'really', 'amazing', 'actress', 'movie', 'ability', 'played', 'out', 'role', 'aging', 'actress', 'mother-trying', 'balance', 'boyfriend', 'daughter', 'desire', 'illustrious', 'career', 'side', 'line', 'actress', 'Susan', 'Kohner', 'playing', 'reckless', 'daughter', 'who', 'only', 'be', 'rid', 'origin-the', 'fact', 'half', 'black-half', 'white', 'mom', 'heart', 'little', 'still', 'feel', 'Susan', 'torn', 'character', 'mom', 'patient', 'heartbreaking', 'rendition', 'Lora', 'Meredith', 'fight', 'best', 'worlds', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'desire', 'mother', 'time', 'affection', 'John', 'Gavin', 'wait', 'love', 'life', 'Lora', 'Meredith', 'lana', '.It', 'story', 'how', 'simple', 'family', 'matters', 'can', 'tear', 'people', 'apart', 'anatomy', 'important', 'issues', 'world', 'today', 'yesterday', 'racial', 'prejudice', 'women', 'working', 'young', 'love', 'hearts', 'faithful.BTW', 'Mahalia', 'sings', 'other', 'end', 'film', 'so', 'anticipate', 'hearing', 'mindblowing', 'singing', 'WATCH', 'AND', 'ENJOY']",Imitation of Life VHS
492758,A36HN1NO7CV072,B000005XPV,"Amazon Customer ""grenadines""","[3, 5]","It's glossy, punchy and melodramatic. The fact that the women are beautiful is an added bonus! This 1959 remake of the original 1934 version probably appeals more to modern day sensibilities. Comparing both versions is inevitable - there are several differences, though the most obvious being the time.Hollywood Diva Lana Turner plays Lora, a struggling widowed actress and mother who, by chance, meets up with a fellow struggling widow, Annie, played adeptly by Juanita Moore. By now, the Aunt Jemima domestic ""Mammy"" image portrayed by Louise Beavers in the original version was deemed politically incorrect, but Juanita plays the dutiful housekeeper all the same. The daughters (played by Sandra Dee and Susan Khoner) hit it off straight away, although there's tension from Annie's pass-for-white daughter from the outset.We advance several years with the girls now in their teens. Lora's now made it as a glittering actress, and can now afford to live in the lap of luxury. Another major difference between this version and the original is that the relationship between the leading ladies is more intertwined. There's an on-screen chemistry that's electric, and it makes for compulsive viewing. Susi and Sarah Jane are like sisters - they practically grew up together. There's also a special bond between Susi and Annie. Indeed, Annie knew that Susi was in love long before her mother did.Although Lana Turner's the star of this movie, she was eclipsed by Juanita Moore and Susan Khoner, who both gave career-best acting performances. Sandra Dee packs a punch too, as the wide-eyed, but neglected Susie. There are some scenes that are heartbreaking, and you can feel Annie's anguish.  Sarah Jane's confused, restless and downright ungrateful! In the end, the viewer doesn't really care about 'Diva' Lora, and her enormous ego.There's something not quite right about the movie, though and it has nothing to do with the acting. I felt that Sarah Jane's character could have been explored in much more detail. It's 1959, on the verge of the Civil Rights movements. Sarah Jane's a beautiful and intelligent young woman who runs away from home and rejects her mother. For what?  So that she can become a dancer in some sleazy nightclub. Give me a break! This was a cop-out from the director who obviously had a very limited view on the capabilities of African Americans. Sure, racism was rife, but was dancing the only option for a young woman with Susi's capabilities?Never mind, what's done is done. I just feel the movie lacks the sincerity of the original in certain parts.The final scenes, like the original, pull out all the stops. Poor Annie - tired, worn and despairing - dies of a broken heart, and has the grandest of funerals, including a majestic, emotionally charged rendition from Gospel legend, Mahalia Jackson. Sarah Jane turns up and throws herself at the casket - just as Peola had done in the original. This is gripping stuff.Juanita Moore and Susan Khoner received Best Supporting Actress nominations for their roles - deservedly so. For years, everyone assumed that the role of Sarah Jane went to a white actress. CORRECTION! In reality, Susan Khoner was mixed-raced herself (part Mexican). Her own racial ambiguity no doubt gave her a valuable insight into Sarah Jane's character. Alas, like the beautiful Fredi Washington (who was typecast as the 'Tragic Mulatto'), Khoner had no blooming movie career after Imitation of Life. She will always be remembered for her outstanding performance in this movie.If you're undecided as to which version to get, I'd say get both and make up your own minds as to which version is better.

Sandra Dee gets the worst of but Juanita Moore does not fare much better.Lora Meredith is woman who knows what she wants.  Success, fame, fortune, and the good life for her daughter, Susie.  Annie Johnson is a woman of much practicality combined with simpler dreams.  A home for her child and spectacular funeral.Annie knows that the road for black people in her world is harsh.  She asks, ""how do I raise my child to be hurt?""  These are questions that cannot be answered then or now easily, however she is willing to endure the lot that has been given to her with a great deal of stoicism.  The same cannot be said of Annie's daughter, Sara Jane, she has been marked for a much crueler fate.  Sara Jane has skin so light that she is routinely mistaken for white.  Unlike her mother she not only sees how the other half-lives, she often lives it too.  Each time Sara Jane manages to `pass' her mother inevitably shows up to set the record straight and make sure that everyone knows her daughter is really a Negro.  It is not surprising the reaction that Sara Jane has to this interference. This is really the only story than can resonate with contemporary viewers.Lana Turner IS able to realize her dream of fame and fortune, but at the price of knowing her family.  She sends her daughter to the best schools, and always buys her the nicest things.  Both she and her child are unfailingly polite to the Johnsons and of course the daughters grow up like sisters (except for that whole best schools and nicest things part).

What unfolds next is a friendship and a bond that forms between these two women and their two daughters as the years trickle by and their life is filled to the brim with drama and tension.You see, while Annie may be black, her daughter Sarah Jane is as white as can be (looks like her father, or so we are told) and so Sarah becomes determined to live as a white girl, even if it means destroying her family.The film tells two stories, one focusing on Lora's acting career and her on-again-off-again romance with photographer Steve Archer; the other focusing on Annie's struggle to get a handle on her daughter.  Lora also has some daughter issues, as Susie grows up and falls in love with Steve while her mother is away shooting a film.  It seems that Lora's career is destroying her relationship with her daughter, as Susie begins to confide in Annie.  Sarah Jane, determined to rid herself of any ties to her black mother, has run away from home and continues to pose as a white girl, hoping and praying for a better life.But the life she gets is not the one she hoped for.The performances for the most part are all stunning.  Lana Turner is beying stunning, and she carries her scenes well enough.  The thing is, she is no match for Juanita Moore, who just devours her every line with such authentic realism.  It's a shame that the whole `big white star' syndrome was in effect at the time, since in my opinion Moore is much more a lead than Turner, whose story arc is far less precedent or even poignant than that of Moore's.  As far as the daughters are concerned, Sandra Dee and Susan Kohner both deliver very good performances.  Dee is a little more even than Kohner, but she's less effective.  Kohner is very, very good in some scenes (especially the `don't recognize me' scene) but she is uneven in some of her earlier scenes (and that dance scene is painful to watch).  Dee is much more consistent, but she doesn't have any powerful scenes to make her truly spark.  The male stars take a major backseat in everyway to the female ones, but John Gavin, Robert Alda and Dan O'Herlihy all deliver nicely.The film may not be as important as it once could have been considered, but it doesn't feel as out of date today as some might think.  This is definitely a film to see, especially for Moore's amazing performance.  Touching and sincere, this is a film that will break your heart; so consider yourself warned.",4,This is no mere imitation...,1240876800,"04 28, 2009",2009,3246,"['Imitation', 'Life', 'quite', 'moving', 'times', 'being', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'will', 'surely', 'label', 'held', 'up', 'years', 'poignant', 'even', 'modern', 'world', 'where', 'race', 'relations', 'are', 'where', 'near', 'tense', 'as', 'controversial', 'were', '50', 'stellar', 'performances', 'intricate', 'character', 'detail', 'Imitation', 'Life', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'film.The', 'film', 'beautiful', 'blonde', 'named', 'Lora', 'frantically', 'searching', 'daughter', 'crowded', 'beach', 'daughter', 'Susie', 'found', 'playmate', 'young', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'Lora', 'daughter', 'sharing', 'snack', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'strange', 'black', 'woman', 'come', 'relief', 'few', 'candid', 'photos', 'subtle', 'yet', 'desperate', 'plea', 'later', 'Lora', 'home', 'black', 'woman', 'Annie', 'daughter', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'What', 'unfolds', 'next', 'friendship', 'bond', 'two', 'women', 'two', 'daughters', 'years', 'trickle', 'life', 'filled', 'brim', 'drama', 'tension.You', 'see', 'Annie', 'may', 'be', 'black', 'daughter', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'as', 'white', 'can', 'be', 'father', 'are', 'told', 'so', 'Sarah', 'becomes', 'determined', 'live', 'white', 'girl', 'even', 'destroying', 'family.The', 'film', 'tells', 'two', 'stories', 'one', 'focusing', 'Lora', 'acting', 'career', 'on-again-off-again', 'romance', 'photographer', 'Steve', 'Archer', 'other', 'focusing', 'Annie', 'struggle', 'get', 'handle', 'daughter', 'Lora', 'also', 'daughter', 'issues', 'Susie', 'up', 'falls', 'love', 'Steve', 'mother', 'away', 'shooting', 'film', 'Lora', 'career', 'destroying', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'Susie', 'confide', 'Annie', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'determined', 'rid', 'ties', 'black', 'mother', 'run', 'away', 'home', 'pose', 'white', 'girl', 'hoping', 'praying', 'better', 'life.But', 'life', 'not', 'one', 'hoped', 'for.The', 'performances', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'stunning', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'beying', 'stunning', 'scenes', 'well', 'enough', 'thing', 'match', 'Juanita', 'Moore', 'who', 'just', 'line', 'such', 'authentic', 'realism', 'shame', 'whole', 'big', 'white', 'star', 'syndrome', 'was', 'effect', 'time', 'opinion', 'Moore', 'much', 'more', 'lead', 'Turner', 'story', 'arc', 'far', 'less', 'precedent', 'even', 'poignant', 'Moore', 'As', 'far', 'daughters', 'are', 'concerned', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'Susan', 'Kohner', 'deliver', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'Dee', 'little', 'more', 'even', 'Kohner', 'less', 'effective', 'Kohner', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'scenes', 'especially', 'do', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'scene', 'uneven', 'earlier', 'scenes', 'dance', 'scene', 'painful', 'watch', 'Dee', 'much', 'more', 'consistent', ""n't"", 'have', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'make', 'truly', 'spark', 'male', 'stars', 'take', 'major', 'backseat', 'everyway', 'female', 'ones', 'John', 'Gavin', 'Robert', 'Alda', 'Dan', ""O'Herlihy"", 'deliver', 'nicely.The', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'important', 'once', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'considered', ""n't"", 'feel', 'date', 'today', 'might', 'think', 'definitely', 'film', 'see', 'especially', 'Moore', 'amazing', 'performance', 'Touching', 'sincere', 'film', 'will', 'break', 'heart', 'consider', 'warned']",Imitation of Life VHS

DON'T READ BEFORE SEEING THIS FILM! *********Actually, I envy anyone who hasn't seen this one yet - they get to see it for the 1st time & it is amazing. Guaranteed to make anyone cry like a baby. Its really an unusual film in that its ostensibly a star vehicle for Lana Turner as Lora - & it is. But the centerpiece of the whole movie is the relationship between Annie(Juanita Moore) & Sarah Jane(Susan Kohner). Lora rises to stardom & makes maybe a hundred costume changes along the way. Her acting gets criticized a lot, but she's perfect for this part - a glamorous, self-absorbed but well-intentioned drama queen totally focused on her career & oblivious to all those around her. There's a brief but telling scene when she blurts out that she never realized that Annie had any friends (or by extension a life outside of being her maid). The 2 women lock eyes for an instant but another character interrupts & the moment is lost forever.Like I said, this film is really about Annie & Sarah Jane & their scenes together (with both versions of Sarah Jane) are literally unbearably painful to watch. Sarah Jane is furious at the cruelty of segregation & prejudice & takes out her resentment at white people on poor Annie. She also has an escape hatch which she discovers early & uses at every opportunity - she can pass as white. But Annie can't & her actual presence repudiates Sarah Jane's lie & her daughter despises her for that fact. So by definition she must also despise herself.Both women richly deserved their Oscar nominations, & as noted their scenes together are incredibly hurtful to watch. The last 2 scenes are particularly brutal. The 1st one is when Annie catches her daughter dancing at a strip club. Annie begs her to come home & talk to her but Sarah Jane turns her back on her & walks away with no intention of ever seeing her mother again. The 2nd one is the goodbye scene when Annie senses she's going to die soon & goes to LA to see Sarah Jane for one last time & is the ultimate tear-jerker. In the motel room when Sarah Jane refuses to let her mother sit down because she only wants to get rid of her as quickly as possible - & we can see how ill & distraught Annie is - this moment will rip the heart right out of your chest no matter how tough you think you are. The rest of this scene, although brief, is no less painful & will make anyone cry no matter how many times you see it.It then becomes apparent that Annie's illness is actually her heart having been broken by her daughter's behavior as well as her constant & merciless abuse. So she dies & she's only in her late 30's or so at the most. But she always wanted a special funeral & had saved up for it over the years. And she gets it - Mahalia Jackson giving her all & an elaborate funeral cortege. We also get a glimpse of Annie's life away from Lora's house. Many people are there & they obviously think very highly of Annie. When Sarah Jane shows up & begs forgiveness much too late - this is one of the all-time great movie endings. In fact, the last 30 minutes or so of this film are extremely difficult to take & I know people who have seen this movie once & refuse to watch it again because its so painful. May be the ultimate chick flick - I can't recommend it highly enough in spite of being a man.The transfer itself is awful. Its apparent that a lot of care went into the colors, set designs, clothes & cinematography but everything just looks washed out. Hopefully this classic will get the restoration it deseves some day.",5,Actually hurts to watch this one,1202947200,"02 14, 2008",2008,3551,"['*************', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'READ', 'SEEING', 'THIS', 'FILM', '*********Actually', 'envy', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'one', 'yet', 'get', 'see', '1st', 'time', 'amazing', 'Guaranteed', 'make', 'anyone', 'cry', 'baby', 'really', 'unusual', 'film', 'ostensibly', 'star', 'vehicle', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'Lora', 'centerpiece', 'whole', 'movie', 'relationship', 'Annie', 'Juanita', 'Moore', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'Susan', 'Kohner', 'Lora', 'stardom', 'maybe', 'hundred', 'costume', 'changes', 'way', 'acting', 'criticized', 'lot', 'perfect', 'part', 'glamorous', 'self-absorbed', 'well-intentioned', 'drama', 'queen', 'totally', 'focused', 'career', 'oblivious', 'brief', 'telling', 'scene', 'when', 'out', 'never', 'realized', 'Annie', 'had', 'friends', 'extension', 'life', 'being', 'maid', '2', 'women', 'lock', 'eyes', 'instant', 'character', 'interrupts', 'moment', 'lost', 'forever.Like', 'said', 'film', 'really', 'Annie', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'scenes', 'together', 'versions', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'are', 'literally', 'unbearably', 'painful', 'watch', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'furious', 'cruelty', 'segregation', 'prejudice', 'out', 'resentment', 'white', 'people', 'poor', 'Annie', 'also', 'escape', 'hatch', 'early', 'uses', 'opportunity', 'can', 'pass', 'white', 'Annie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'actual', 'presence', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'lie', 'daughter', 'fact', 'So', 'definition', 'must', 'also', 'despise', 'women', 'richly', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'noted', 'scenes', 'together', 'are', 'incredibly', 'hurtful', 'watch', 'last', '2', 'scenes', 'are', 'particularly', 'brutal', '1st', 'one', 'when', 'Annie', 'daughter', 'dancing', 'strip', 'club', 'Annie', 'come', 'home', 'talk', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'back', 'walks', 'away', 'intention', 'ever', 'seeing', 'mother', 'again', '2nd', 'one', 'goodbye', 'scene', 'when', 'Annie', 'going', 'die', 'soon', 'LA', 'see', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'ultimate', 'tear-jerker', 'motel', 'room', 'when', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'let', 'mother', 'sit', 'down', 'only', 'get', 'rid', 'as', 'quickly', 'possible', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'ill', 'distraught', 'Annie', 'moment', 'will', 'rip', 'heart', 'right', 'chest', 'matter', 'how', 'tough', 'think', 'are', 'rest', 'scene', 'brief', 'less', 'painful', 'will', 'make', 'anyone', 'cry', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'see', 'it.It', 'then', 'apparent', 'Annie', 'illness', 'actually', 'heart', 'having', 'been', 'broken', 'daughter', 'behavior', 'as', 'well', 'constant', 'merciless', 'abuse', 'only', 'late', '30', 'so', 'most', 'always', 'wanted', 'special', 'funeral', 'had', 'saved', 'up', 'years', 'Mahalia', 'Jackson', 'giving', 'elaborate', 'funeral', 'cortege', 'also', 'get', 'glimpse', 'Annie', 'life', 'away', 'Lora', 'house', 'Many', 'people', 'are', 'there', 'obviously', 'think', 'very', 'highly', 'Annie', 'When', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'up', 'begs', 'forgiveness', 'much', 'too', 'late', 'one', 'all-time', 'great', 'movie', 'endings', 'fact', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'so', 'film', 'are', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'take', 'know', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'once', 'refuse', 'watch', 'again', 'so', 'painful', 'May', 'be', 'ultimate', 'chick', 'flick', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'highly', 'enough', 'spite', 'being', 'man.The', 'transfer', 'awful', 'apparent', 'lot', 'care', 'went', 'colors', 'set', 'designs', 'clothes', 'cinematography', 'everything', 'just', 'looks', 'washed', 'out', 'Hopefully', 'classic', 'will', 'get', 'restoration', 'day']",Imitation of Life VHS

However, this film is far from a clunker.  Listed on the NY Times ""1000 best movies ever,"" the material lifts this from being just another unintentionally humorous slice of ham wherein the actors are so stagey that it hurts.The meat of the story involves two mother-daughter relationships damaged by ambition:  In one, Lana Turner's drive to be a great Broadway actress (which helps dilute the hamminess of her performance) keeps her away from daughter Sandra Dee more than either might like, eventually raising some bitterness toward Mommie Dearie.  In the other, live-in African-American maid Juanita Moore serves Turner's character faithfully but her very light-skinned daughter Susan Kohner aspires to more than the world of the 1940s/50s allows most people of color.  These two lesser-known actresses were in fact nominated for Academy Awards for their work in this film.The entire story line involving Turner, her daughter, and moon-eyed love interest John Gavin is essentially predictable, and is given center stage.  I would've loved to see more screen time given the other characters.  The real drama of the film isn't the hackneyed story of a struggling actress fighting her way to the top without giving in to the advances of sleazy agents and producers, while sacrificing her romance with Gavin on the altar of career, but the struggle of the oppressed African-American, so little explored in films of this era, to have equal rights with people who happened to have been born with lighter skin.Kohner's character desires to ""pass,"" as it was once known, to call herself white.  The actress playing the role is actually the daughter of Hispanic and Austrian parents, so it's no stretch that she can ""pass for white,"" but she perfectly embodies the angst of her character, which startlingly mirrors that of her ""mammy's"" white ""owner,"" as she once bitterly accuses.This film is well worth seeing, for those of us young enough to consider this film almost hopelessly dated, because it paints such a vivid picture of the pre-Civil Rights era.  The ambition just to be considered an equal is here presented as strong enough not only for a young lady to totally reject her heritage, not only to leave home and friends and all she's ever known, but to thoroughly defy and despise a dear mother whose only sin was to be born, unlike herself, with noticeably African-American features.  It's forever to the shame of the prejudices of a bygone era that this actually happened sometimes, a part of our nation's race relations that's rarely discussed any longer because it no longer needs to happen.  For that reason, even surrounded by dreadful sequences like the horrifyingly cliche scene that shows the passage of time with ""1948"" and ""1949"" etc. screens zooming at the viewer, and even with Turner's ridiculous number of costume/jewelry changes, ""Imitation of Life"" is very much worth a peek.",3,"Dated, hammy, but worth seeing",1107388800,"02 3, 2005",2005,2985,"['So', 'sue', 'did', ""n't"", 'cry', 'hankie-jerking', 'ending', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'fan', 'melodrama', 'However', 'film', 'far', 'clunker', 'Listed', 'NY', 'Times', '1000', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'material', 'lifts', 'being', 'just', 'unintentionally', 'humorous', 'slice', 'ham', 'wherein', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'stagey', 'meat', 'story', 'two', 'mother-daughter', 'relationships', 'damaged', 'ambition', 'one', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'drive', 'be', 'great', 'Broadway', 'actress', 'dilute', 'hamminess', 'performance', 'away', 'daughter', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'more', 'either', 'might', 'like', 'eventually', 'raising', 'bitterness', 'Mommie', 'Dearie', 'other', 'live-in', 'African-American', 'maid', 'Juanita', 'Moore', 'Turner', 'character', 'faithfully', 'very', 'light-skinned', 'daughter', 'Susan', 'Kohner', 'more', 'world', '1940s/50s', 'most', 'people', 'color', 'two', 'lesser-known', 'actresses', 'were', 'fact', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'work', 'film.The', 'entire', 'story', 'line', 'involving', 'Turner', 'daughter', 'moon-eyed', 'love', 'interest', 'John', 'Gavin', 'essentially', 'predictable', 'given', 'center', 'stage', 'would', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'see', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'given', 'other', 'characters', 'real', 'drama', 'film', ""n't"", 'hackneyed', 'story', 'struggling', 'actress', 'fighting', 'way', 'top', 'giving', 'advances', 'sleazy', 'agents', 'producers', 'sacrificing', 'romance', 'Gavin', 'altar', 'career', 'struggle', 'oppressed', 'African-American', 'so', 'little', 'explored', 'films', 'era', 'have', 'equal', 'rights', 'people', 'who', 'happened', 'have', 'been', 'born', 'lighter', 'skin.Kohner', 'character', 'pass', 'was', 'once', 'known', 'call', 'white', 'actress', 'playing', 'role', 'actually', 'daughter', 'Hispanic', 'Austrian', 'parents', 'stretch', 'can', 'pass', 'white', 'perfectly', 'angst', 'character', 'startlingly', 'mirrors', 'mammy', 'white', 'owner', 'once', 'bitterly', 'accuses.This', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'young', 'enough', 'consider', 'film', 'almost', 'hopelessly', 'dated', 'such', 'vivid', 'picture', 'pre-Civil', 'Rights', 'era', 'ambition', 'just', 'be', 'considered', 'equal', 'here', 'presented', 'strong', 'enough', 'not', 'only', 'young', 'lady', 'totally', 'reject', 'heritage', 'not', 'only', 'leave', 'home', 'friends', 'ever', 'known', 'thoroughly', 'defy', 'despise', 'dear', 'mother', 'only', 'sin', 'was', 'be', 'born', 'noticeably', 'African-American', 'features', 'forever', 'shame', 'prejudices', 'bygone', 'era', 'actually', 'happened', 'sometimes', 'part', 'nation', 'race', 'relations', 'rarely', 'discussed', 'longer', 'no', 'longer', 'happen', 'reason', 'even', 'surrounded', 'dreadful', 'sequences', 'horrifyingly', 'cliche', 'scene', 'passage', 'time', '1948', '1949', 'etc', 'screens', 'zooming', 'viewer', 'even', 'Turner', 'ridiculous', 'number', 'costume/jewelry', 'changes', 'Imitation', 'Life', 'very', 'much', 'peek']",Imitation of Life VHS

Lora is a Broadway starlet intent on hitting the big time, which will come at the cost of her daughter Susie (Sandra Dee), while Annie's daughter Sarah Jane (Susan Kohner) is a black girl with a pale complexion, who chooses to pass as white in order to avoid the hatred of a prejudiced world.As years of denial and unawareness pass, the two girls slowly revolt from their mothers, and the story moves to its emotional and tearful conclusion.Still compelling over 50 years later, IMITATION OF LIFE still has a message for modern audiences, and preserves the tour-de-force performances of Juanita Moore and Susan Kohner. Both were Oscar-nominated for their work here. The performances of Sandra Dee and Lana Turner (and Troy Donahue as Sarah Jane's violent boyfriend) are just as impressive.The supporting cast includes John Gavin, Dan O'Herlihy, Robert Alda and Mahalia Jackson.

A story of two strong women, one white, one black, who become accidental friends out of compassion and necessity during a racially predjudicial time.  While Lana Turner (Lora) and Sandra Dee (Susie) are the ""stars"" of the movie, in reality it is Juanita Moore (Annie) and Susan Kohner (Sarah Jane)who were rightfully nominated for Academy Awards and have kept me fascinated with the movie for the last 40 years.  These two loving mothers, Lora, a struggling starlet and Annie, an honest homemaker, meet when their young daughters, Susie and Sarah Jane, bond while playing together on the beach. The kind-hearted Lora takes the homeless Annie and Sarah Jane home with her and Susie ""for the night"", but Annie proves invaluable to Lora so that she and her daughter can remain indefinitely, and the four quickly fall into a comfortable dynamic. Lora chases her dreams and supplies a roof over their heads, while Annie does the ""heavy lifting"" by running the household with virtually no money and being primary caregiver to both girls.  As the years pass, these four become a loving, if somewhat unconventional family as Lora reaches her goals of fame and fortune, allbeit sometimes at the expense of her relationship with Susie, and Annie continues to ""work for her keep"" long after the necessity is gone.  As Susie grows to young adulthood with money and privilege, Sarah Jane, unwilling to endure the unfairness of racial predjudice, constantly breaks her mother's heart as she ""passes"" as white and even cuts all ties with her obviously ""not white"" mother.  In my opinion, this is the reason this movie is so compelling and remains timeless.  And, if you do not shed tears at the end of this movie, you're just not human.

492787,A2P32S5DL0WMFN,B000005XPV,"Dick Bobnick ""toughreviewer""","[1, 1]","My five star rating is for the film itself, not the quality of the DVD transfer.  This film is a true classic and though it has some script and scene flaws it still exemplifies the kind of film that Hollywood ""used"" to make so well:  Strong believabe plot (single mother yearns for success in the theatre and will do just about anything to achieve it), Sudden romance that gets in the way of career goals, sub plot involving a black domestic with a daughter who has serious identity problems, sudden fame and fortune and ever degenerating family problems and finally realization that fame and fortune are empty achievements when family and love is sacrificed.  This film closely parallels star Lana Turner's own private and public life, at the time, and was a  better screenplay than IMITATION.  That fact might be the main reason she was chosen for the role and the film scored sobig at the boxoffice.In addition to the glitzy cast, Turner, John Gavin, Sandra Dee and Robert Alda, relative newcomers Juanita Moore and Susan Kohner round out an impressive cast.  This undoubtedly was Turner's biggest and most successful role, revitalizing a waning film career.  The film, under Ross Hunter's direction, will show younger audiences what ""real glamour"" and ""star power"" is all about.  Lana was the epitome of the ""star"", always carried herself like a queen and commanded the attention on the screen in every scene she was in (Jennifer Lopez and Cameron Diaz note).  The sets, wardrobe, jewels and makeup are sumptuous.  The romantic interludes suggest rather than hit you in the face, graphically.  The last thirty minutes of the film will leave the most hardened viewer emotionally drained.  My family has seen it countless times, we enjoy it each time and are tear filled at the end.

492793,A8V74RZY8TIRJ,B000005XPV,"Forrest C. Hopson ""StarWatcher""","[1, 2]","""Imitation of Life"" opens with a sweepingly romantic title song sung by Earl Grant which puts the viewer in the perfect mood for the glitzy drama that is about to unfold. Aspiring actress Lora Meredith (Lana Turner) meets Annie Johnson (Juanita Moore) a homeless black woman at Coney Island and soon they share a tiny apartment. Each woman has an intolerable daughter, though Annie's little girl Sarah Jane (Susan Kohner), is by far the worse.  Sarah Jane doesn't like being black; since she's light-skinned (her father was practically white), she spends the rest of the film passing as white, much to her mother's heartache and shame. Lora, meanwhile, virtually ignores her own daughter (Sandra Dee) in a single-minded quest for stardom. Legendary movie director Douglas Sirk's (""Written On The Wind"" (1956), ""All That Heaven Allows"" (1955) last American film.One of Hollywood's most memorable 4-hankie romantic drama masterpieces stars ultra glamorous Lana Turner in one of the major roles of her career that's she's best remembered for. The other being her prim and proper role as the screen's most notorious single mother in Grace Metalious' controversial ""Peyton Place"" (1957). ""Imitation of Life"" brings so much to the screen in it's story of two single mothers, one white and one black, who see the world in different respects to raising their daughters.  Sandra Dee is her usual sweet and temperamental self as Lana's love starved daughter, and Susan Kohner (a Natalie Wood look-a-like) does a fantastic job as Juanita's light skinned daughter, who wishes Lana were her mother! Hollywood leading men John Gavin and Troy Donahue add some love interests to Lana and Sandra's lives and Gospel great Mahalia Jackson sings at a funeral in the film's grand finale!I highly recommend ""Imitation of Life"" to classic romantic drama DVD collectors, especially fans of Lana Turner and Sandra Dee. And I also recommend Lana Turner's  ""Peyton Place,"" ""Madame X,"" ""By Love Possessed,"" and ""Portrait in Black,"" with only ""Peyton Place"" currently available on DVD.  Also check out Sandra Dee, with Troy Donahue in ""A Summer Place,"" which is also available on DVD!

492795,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B000005XPV,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[124, 133]","Although little known today, in her own era author Fannie Hurst was among America's most famous authors, a writer who frequently challenged the status quo in both her life and her literature.  Among her most popular works was the novel IMITATION OF LIFE, which first came to the screen starring Claudette Colbert and Louise Beavers in 1934.  Today both the novel and film would be considered somewhat racist--but at the time both were considered social shockers, dealing frankly with single mothers, rebellious daughters, and racial issues in a way that few novels and fewer still films of the era dared.The first film version was as faithful to the novel as it dared be, telling the story of two single mothers--one black, one white--who join forces and hit the big time when the white woman successfully markets the black woman's pancake recipe.  But the 1959 film version substituted pancake make-up for pancake batter: the white woman is an actress, and with her black friend behind her she climbs the ladder to Broadway stardom.  Director Douglas Sirk was reknowned for his ability with this sort of material, and although he did better films IMITATION OF LIFE is perhaps his most obvious stylistic statement: gallons of gloss, more soap suds than a sink full of dishes, and enough vulgar melodrama to fuel a thousand 1950s schoolgirl dreams.This time around our stars are Lana Turner and Juanita Moore, supported by Sandra Dee and Susan Kohner as the respective and rebellious daughters who make their mothers lives a living hell, with Lana's daughter Sandra falling in love with her mother's beau and Juanita's daughter Susan determined to defeat the racist society in which she lives by passing for white.  All four actresses give it everything they've got, which means they all emote to the nth degree as they suffer through every emotional upheaval the screenwriters can devise.Turner and Dee are essentially Turner and Dee.  The real surprises here are Moore and Kohner. Saddled with a story that still keeps the black woman in the kitchen while the white woman plays, Moore nonetheless gives an outstanding and ultimately heartbreaking performance, and Kohner matches her every bit of the way as the wayward daughter who makes one bad choice after another in her refusal to knuckle under to a repressive society.  It is a tremendous pity that neither actress went on to equally high-profile roles and films, but the times were against them--as the very nature of the film's story should make abundantly clear.The original novel and film were actually advanced for their time, but by the time this version hit the screen the ""white lady upstairs and the black lady downstairs"" was hardly a rung up the ladder.  Even in 1959 many denounced the film as perpetuating racial stereotypes and class-thinking, and by today's standards it is alternately distasteful and absurd.  But oddly enough, that fact doesn't undercut the incredible watchablity of the film.  We may sneer at some of the values it presents, but it holds our attention all the way, and you'll need at least three hankies for the film's conclusion.  If you are torn between purchasing the DVD or a VHS version, you should know that there is actually little difference between the two.  The film has not been restored for DVD, and the lack of restoration is quite noticeable; moreover, the only bonus material on the DVD is the theatrical trailer.  You might prefer to go with a low cost VHS until a really good DVD is released.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",4,A Memorable Guilty Pleasure,1048377600,"03 23, 2003",2003,3520,"['little', 'known', 'today', 'own', 'era', 'author', 'Fannie', 'Hurst', 'was', 'America', 'most', 'famous', 'authors', 'writer', 'who', 'frequently', 'challenged', 'status', 'quo', 'life', 'literature', 'most', 'popular', 'works', 'was', 'novel', 'IMITATION', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'first', 'came', 'screen', 'starring', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'Louise', 'Beavers', '1934', 'Today', 'novel', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'somewhat', 'racist', 'time', 'were', 'considered', 'social', 'shockers', 'dealing', 'frankly', 'single', 'mothers', 'rebellious', 'daughters', 'racial', 'issues', 'way', 'few', 'novels', 'fewer', 'still', 'films', 'era', 'dared.The', 'first', 'film', 'version', 'was', 'as', 'faithful', 'novel', 'dared', 'be', 'telling', 'story', 'two', 'single', 'mothers', 'one', 'black', 'one', 'white', 'who', 'join', 'forces', 'hit', 'big', 'time', 'when', 'white', 'woman', 'successfully', 'markets', 'black', 'woman', 'pancake', 'recipe', '1959', 'film', 'version', 'substituted', 'pancake', 'make-up', 'pancake', 'batter', 'white', 'woman', 'actress', 'black', 'friend', 'ladder', 'Broadway', 'stardom', 'Director', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'was', 'reknowned', 'ability', 'sort', 'material', 'did', 'better', 'films', 'IMITATION', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'perhaps', 'most', 'obvious', 'stylistic', 'statement', 'gallons', 'gloss', 'more', 'soap', 'suds', 'sink', 'full', 'dishes', 'enough', 'vulgar', 'melodrama', 'fuel', 'thousand', '1950s', 'schoolgirl', 'dreams.This', 'time', 'stars', 'are', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'Juanita', 'Moore', 'supported', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'Susan', 'Kohner', 'respective', 'rebellious', 'daughters', 'who', 'make', 'mothers', 'living', 'hell', 'Lana', 'daughter', 'Sandra', 'falling', 'love', 'mother', 'beau', 'Juanita', 'daughter', 'Susan', 'determined', 'defeat', 'racist', 'society', 'passing', 'white', 'four', 'actresses', 'give', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'got', 'emote', 'nth', 'degree', 'suffer', 'emotional', 'upheaval', 'screenwriters', 'can', 'devise.Turner', 'Dee', 'are', 'essentially', 'Turner', 'Dee', 'real', 'surprises', 'here', 'are', 'Moore', 'Kohner', 'Saddled', 'story', 'still', 'black', 'woman', 'kitchen', 'white', 'woman', 'plays', 'Moore', 'nonetheless', 'outstanding', 'ultimately', 'heartbreaking', 'performance', 'Kohner', 'bit', 'way', 'wayward', 'daughter', 'who', 'one', 'bad', 'choice', 'refusal', 'knuckle', 'repressive', 'society', 'tremendous', 'pity', 'actress', 'went', 'equally', 'high-profile', 'roles', 'films', 'times', 'were', 'very', 'nature', 'film', 'story', 'should', 'make', 'abundantly', 'clear.The', 'original', 'novel', 'film', 'were', 'actually', 'advanced', 'time', 'time', 'version', 'hit', 'screen', 'white', 'lady', 'upstairs', 'black', 'lady', 'downstairs', 'was', 'hardly', 'rung', 'up', 'ladder', 'Even', '1959', 'many', 'denounced', 'film', 'perpetuating', 'racial', 'stereotypes', 'class-thinking', 'today', 'standards', 'alternately', 'distasteful', 'absurd', 'oddly', 'enough', 'fact', ""n't"", 'undercut', 'incredible', 'watchablity', 'film', 'may', 'sneer', 'values', 'attention', 'way', ""'ll"", 'need', 'least', 'three', 'hankies', 'film', 'conclusion', 'are', 'torn', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'version', 'should', 'know', 'actually', 'little', 'difference', 'two', 'film', 'not', 'been', 'restored', 'DVD', 'lack', 'restoration', 'quite', 'noticeable', 'moreover', 'only', 'bonus', 'material', 'DVD', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'might', 'prefer', 'go', 'low', 'cost', 'VHS', 'really', 'good', 'DVD', 'released.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",Imitation of Life VHS

The story, from Fannie Hurst's novel, was previously filmed in 1934, starring Claudette Colbert and Louise Beavers. In the 1934 version, the two women (one white, one black) were business partners. In the 1959 version, the black woman is the white woman's maid. So much for racial advancement! However, the 1959 version is one of my guilty pleasures. The film is so OBVIOUSLY &quot;Hollywood&quot; and &quot;Plastic&quot; that I would have to agree with John Epperson, aka &quot;Lypsinka&quot;, the hilariously performance artist, that Douglas Sirk was putting his own spin on &quot;The Hollywood Movie&quot;. Lana Turner's hair is platinum blonde. Her wardrobe is predominantly white and beige. Her house is decorated in white-on-white. Her daughter, played by the very white Sandra Dee, is dressed in fluffy pastels. No wonder poor Sara Jane Johnson was nearly driven mad, to be surrounded by all this in-your-face whiteness. To me, as I'm sure as to many others, that the relationship between Sara Jane and her mother, the grin-and-bear-it Annie, is the core of this film. Yes, African-Americans did NOT have an easy time in a caucasian-dominated society. Inter-relations between whites and blacks was taboo, not to mention marriage. Upward mobility was not impossible, but difficult. I always felt that Lana Turner's character, Lora Meredith, didn't have too many &quot;problems&quot;. I always felt that her biggest problem was deciding what Jean Louis gown to wear. However, the scenes between Juanita Moore and Susan Kohner are, to me, very heart-wrenching. They are an excellent contrast to all of Lana Turner's scenes, which always make me howl. The lady was a stunner. Her acting, if you want to call it that, left something to be desired. But she was a &quot;movie star&quot; in every sense of the word. Even her rather messed-up, scandalous  personal life added a deranged tinge of glamour to her, a sort of wayward Barbie doll.

492803,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B000005XPV,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 1]","This film is completely different in many ways from all the others because it reaches an extremely high level of density, a tremendous depth of compassion and empathy. The film is centered on four women, two mothers and two daughters. One mother is white and an actress with a great career. The other woman is black and a servant to the actress all her life. The drama is double for the four women. The daughter of the white actress falls in love with the man who waited for her mother to be ready to love him and finally gets the prize he had been expecting for so long when the daughter finally lets the world know, discreetly, that she is in love with the man her mother is going to marry. The second drama is that the white daughter of the black mother is ashamed of being black and wants to escape that fate, that ordeal, that curse. She breaks the heart of her mother of course but her mother lets her go and do what she wants, be a chorus line girl in Hollywood. The film is extremely sentimental and effective. It is heart raking, heart breaking and even more than that. Yet the film is cruelly to the point in the present period when the racial question is coming back to the foreground. Can anyone escape one's racial descent? Of course not? Can anyone reject another human being or even judge another human being only because that other human being is black? Of course not. But can anyone aim at being what they are not and behave as white if they are black, and vice versa? Of course not. The question, the very problematic should not even exist in our minds. The closing scenes of the film after the death of the black mother cannot be told in any way. You have to see them. One thing is sure Sirk knows how to stir, move and exacerbate his audience's feelings and the lesson is received one hundred percent. The last ten minutes of that film are just a beauty of cinematographic art.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID",5,Even before MLK at the foot of the Lincoln Memorial,1288656000,"11 2, 2010",2010,2031,"['film', 'completely', 'different', 'many', 'ways', 'others', 'extremely', 'high', 'level', 'density', 'tremendous', 'depth', 'compassion', 'empathy', 'film', 'centered', 'four', 'women', 'two', 'mothers', 'two', 'daughters', 'One', 'mother', 'white', 'actress', 'great', 'career', 'other', 'woman', 'black', 'servant', 'actress', 'life', 'drama', 'double', 'four', 'women', 'daughter', 'white', 'actress', 'falls', 'love', 'man', 'who', 'waited', 'mother', 'be', 'ready', 'love', 'finally', 'prize', 'had', 'been', 'expecting', 'so', 'long', 'when', 'daughter', 'finally', 'world', 'know', 'discreetly', 'love', 'man', 'mother', 'going', 'marry', 'second', 'drama', 'white', 'daughter', 'black', 'mother', 'ashamed', 'being', 'black', 'escape', 'fate', 'ordeal', 'curse', 'heart', 'mother', 'course', 'mother', 'go', 'do', 'what', 'be', 'chorus', 'line', 'girl', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'extremely', 'sentimental', 'effective', 'heart', 'raking', 'heart', 'breaking', 'even', 'more', 'film', 'cruelly', 'point', 'present', 'period', 'when', 'racial', 'question', 'coming', 'back', 'foreground', 'Can', 'anyone', 'escape', 'one', 'racial', 'descent', 'course', 'not', 'Can', 'anyone', 'reject', 'human', 'being', 'even', 'judge', 'human', 'being', 'only', 'other', 'human', 'being', 'black', 'course', 'not', 'can', 'anyone', 'aim', 'being', 'what', 'are', 'not', 'behave', 'white', 'are', 'black', 'vice', 'versa', 'course', 'not', 'question', 'very', 'problematic', 'should', 'not', 'even', 'exist', 'minds', 'closing', 'scenes', 'film', 'death', 'black', 'mother', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'told', 'way', 'have', 'see', 'One', 'thing', 'sure', 'Sirk', 'how', 'stir', 'move', 'exacerbate', 'audience', 'feelings', 'lesson', 'received', 'one', 'hundred', 'percent', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'just', 'beauty', 'cinematographic', 'art.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Paris', '8', 'Saint', 'Denis', 'University', 'Paris', '12', 'Cr', 'eacute', 'CEGID']",Imitation of Life VHS

Susan is stunning in this and she is the only reason it is even worth watching, and she is not laugable as trying to ""pass for black"", as Jeanne Crain was in ""Pinky"" (which is actually a better movie).A common theme in these ""passing"" movies made back then (including the original 1934 version) was that passing for white was wrong. How Peola (in the original version) and Sarah Jane (in this version) treated their mother was wrong, but if someone wants to pass for white so they will be treated equally (which they shouldn't have to do), I don't have a problem with that.Now when it comes to romantic relationships, it's very important to some people to preserve their white heritage, and I don't have a problem with that, just as I don't have a problem with black people wanting to preserve their black heritage, but for those to whom it's not an issue, I don't pass judgement on them. Interracial relationships are not a moral issue, but rather a social and cultural issue, and then what about the children?That being said, I think Sarah Jane was wrong not to tell her secret boyfriend about her heritage (especially since it was implied they slept together), though I understand why she didn't.Anyway, John Gavin's character (Steve Archer) as the long-suffering admirer of Lana Turner (Lora Meredith), who really ""acts"" (but she is playing a stage actress, and they are known for over-acting), could have been left out completely, and the crush Sandra Dee (Susie), who plays Lana's very annoying teenage daughter, should have definitely been left out. I always thought this story added nothing to the movie.When Lora told Susie that she would give Steve up because her daughter was in love with him (and she was like what, fifteen?), all of a sudden, Susie was angry with her mother for never being there for her when she seemed happy before. It was so obvious she was just mad that Steve was in love with her mother, not her. I just rolled my eyes--Sandra Dee was so retarded in this movie.I'm really not into actresses playing phony actresses, and I could never see what was so great about Lana Turner in this movie that she became such a star. Lana was never really all that pretty to begin with. Glamorous, yes, beautiful, I think not.As another reviewer stated, the years passing sequence was pretty cheesy. I mean, I think we could have figured out on our own that several years had passed when we saw the girls all grown up.I liked Annie, but I was annoyed that she just never ""got it"" when it came to her daughter. She kept showing up and embarrassing her, and though I understand how hurtful that can be, I think her mother should have also understood that children can be cruel, and Sarah Jane was passing in school so she could make friends.I thought Sarah Jane was the only real character in the whole movie.There were a couple of parts that just didn't click, like when Lora says to Annie (sorry, I can't remember the woman's name) that she didn't know she had any friends (hell, they had lived together for years!), and Annie said she had never asked.Also, there was hardly any mention of Susie's father (which is why ""The Brady Bunch"" never made any sense to me in that respect).Then when Lora tells Sarah Jane about the Hawkins boy (I think that was his name--and Hawkins was black), and doesn't get it why Sarah Jane gets upset over this, because it's like she doesn't even have the right to like a white boy. And then when Lora says, ""We've never treated you any differently,"" well, right there, I mean, it's like she had a reason to, but because she's oh-so-kind, she chose not to.I still have no idea what the significance is with the big funeral.

Annie has a child but that child hates her blackness so much that she abandons her own mother for being too dark skinned to pass for anything else.Everything that happens in this movie leads up to one powerful scene that still makes me cry to this day. It's Annie's furneral. Unlike Miss Julie, Annie REALLY saved her money and it's a funeral fit for a queen. Mahalia Jackson is singing Troubles of the World and every black person from what looks like the whole of New York is in attendence along with Lana Turner and Sandra Dee who ride in the family(!) car behind the hearse.

Lora Meredith (Lana Turner), a struggling actress, meets homeless and unemployed domestic Annie Johnson (Juanita Moore); moved by Annie's plight and in need of help, Lora takes Annie and her daughter Sarah Jane into her home.  As the years pass, Lora becomes the toast of Broadway while steadfast Annie suffers horribly because Sarah Jane is embarrassed by her mother's dark skin and wants to pass for white.This 1959 film is full of fine performances and good writing that overcome the occasional clich&eacute;s and soap-opera feel.  Turner does put the 'melo' in this drama with her silly histrionics, but that's how her shallow and conceited character would act.  Sandra Dee is good and perky as always as her teenage daughter, but the film belongs to Juanita Moore and Susan Kohner, who plays Sarah Jane.  Their story line is the more interesting one, fraught with heartache and regrets.  Moore is a wonderful actress and quite often moved me to tears with her quiet, unconditional love in spite of her daughter's rejection.  Sarah Jane should have been played by a black actress, but Kohner is excellent.This is a movie that can be enjoyed over and over.  The wardrobe is lovely, the sets colorful, and the dialogue is realistic.

492818,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B000005XPV,Lawyeraau,"[51, 58]","Based upon the best selling, Fannie Hurst novel of the same name, this 1959 remake of the 1934 film starring Claudette Colbert and Louise Deavers is a terrific, well acted, sentimental melodrama that should be viewed with a caveat. While not so politically incorrect as to be nearly astounding, as was the 1934 version, it still presents a stereotypic view of blacks reflective of the time in which this movie was filmed. It is certainly is a view that is jarring in these more enlightened times, as it reflects the nature of the racism that was inherent in our society at that time. Remember, this film was made before the civil rights movement took root. Notwithstanding this, it is still a remarkable film that will hold the viewer in its thrall.Lana Turner plays the role of Lora Meredith, a struggling widow and aspiring actress with a young daughter named Susie. Juanita Moore plays the part of Annie Johnson, also a struggling widow. Together they join forces, enabling Lora to pursue her dreams and Annie to provide a home for her own young daughter, Sarah Jane. Lora follows her dreams of fame and fortune, with Annie, as Lora's housekeeper, providing the stability of a regular home life for Susie and Sarah Jane.Before you know it, Lora becomes a star on Broadway. Along the way, she is romanced by Steve (John Gavin), who met Lora when she was still living in a cold water flat and he was a promising artist with dreams of his own. While climbing the rungs of the ladder of success, Lora is propositioned by her agent, Allen Loomis (Robert Alda), who, charmed by her basic decency and refusal to go the casting couch route, takes her on as a client, anyway. She also is romanced by a playwright, David Edwards (Dan O'Herlihy), with whom she forges a successful professional collaboration.Meanwhile, Annie still keeps the hearth fire burning at home, always the perennial ""mammy"", as Susie (Sandra Dee) and Sarah Jane (Susan Koehner) grow up to be two very attractive young ladies. Moreover, while Lora treats Annie with affection, love, and care, there is not a level playing field between them. Lora and Susie always address Annie by her first name. Yet, Annie always addresses them as Miz Lora and Miz Susie. Moreover, while Annie knows everything about Lora's personal life, Lora knows nothing about Annie's, as she has never even asked about it, something Annie points out to Lora. The racial divide is there for all to see.Meanwhile, the years have passed and Annie's light skinned daughter, clearly knows the score. Sarah Jane certainly has no intention of being anyone's ""mammy"" and wants to pass for white, as she does not wish to be relegated to second class citizenry. She does not try to do this because she wants to be white, but rather, she wants the advantages associated with being white in that time. Hers is not a decision based upon race self-hate, but upon a realistic assessment of how she could be all she could be. Still, she breaks Annie's heart by doing this, and when Annie dies, a part of Sarah Jane dies with her. Annie's funeral is also a focal cinematic moment due to the spiritual sung by the magnificent Mahalia Jackson.The film updates the original in a number of ways in order to give the film a more contemporary look. The part of Annie (Delilah in the 1934 version) now calls for less of a stereotypic ""mammy"" look. Annie is more of an black Betty Crocker, finer featured, trim, and a bit stylish. Yet, the very nature of the role is still stereotypic in that Annie is still portrayed as the long suffering, self-sacrificing, religious, black servant who wants nothing more than to make life easier for her white mistress. Annie may have shed the ""mammy"" look, but she is still portrayed as a ""mammy"" at heart. Moreover, Lora's relationship with Annie in this 1959 remake is stuck in time, as it is still the same as Bea's relationship with Delilah in the 1934 version.Interestingly enough, in this remake Susan Koehner, a white actress, was cast in the role of the light skinned Sarah Jane (Peola in the 1934 version), while bi-racial Fredi Washington played the role of the light skinned Peola in the 1934 version. Although the casting of a white woman for the role of a light skinned black woman may be puzzling to those of us in the twenty first century, I presume that this was done in order to be on the safe side. In the 1934 original, Peola did not have a white boyfriend, while in this remake Sarah Jane has an on screen white boyfriend (Troy Donahue). Although she does not have any love scenes with him, there is still the underlying concept of a black woman having a white boyfriend, and they do have a scene together, though it can hardly be called a love scene. I surmise that the studio chose to play it safe for this reason, casting a white actress in the part rather than a light skinned black one, so as to avoid actual controversy in certain parts of the country. This is, however, pure conjecture on my part.All in all, this is a mesmerizing film, both cinematically and historically, as it is a reflection of another time in which racial conflict was viewed in such a paternalistic way. Lana Turner, Juanita Moore, and Susan Koehner all give moving, compelling performances, notwithstanding the political incorrectness of the script. Sandra Dee sweetly handles the role of Susie with wide-eyed innocence. John Gavin, Robert Alda, and Dan O'Herlihy all give deft supporting performances as the men in Lora's life. Juanita Moore and Susan Koehner each deservedly won an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. This anachronistic, well directed, sentimental tearjerker is a definite must see by those who enjoy first rate melodramas.",5,FIVE HANKY TEARJERKER....,1048982400,"03 30, 2003",2003,5722,"['Based',

Lora is a stage actress who offers Annie a position as a housekeeper since Annie is homeless and going from door to door for a job. They soon become close friends. Rebellious strong willed teenage daughter Sarah Jane is ashamed of being half-black (despite the fact that the white women in the house treat her as an equal) She is sullen, bratty, insecure and tries to fit in with the white folks to feel accepted. She often berates her mother for telling people that they&#8217;re related and doesn&#8217;t want to be around her. Towards the climax of the film, she runs away and becomes a dancer at sleazy night clubs. Longsuffering mother Annie gently admonishes her and tries to restore her to the straight and narrow road but when Sarah makes it clear she wants nothing more to do with Annie, Annie says she may go her way but that she will always be &#34;My beautiful little baby&#34; and if anything goes wrong she can always come back because her arms will always be open to her. Eventually, Annie becomes sick and dies. At the funeral, Sarah tears through the crowd screaming &#34;LET ME THROGUH PLEASE! THAT'S MY MOTHER! THAT'S MY MOTHER!&#34; In one of the most tear-jerking scenes ever filmed (and I don't usually cry on movies) she hugs the coffin and says &#34;I'm such a dirty, sorry shame! It's all my fault! Please forgive me! Can you hear me up there? Can you? I beg you to forgive me!&#34; Then she goes back home with Lora and Susie.One thing I love about this film is how it develops the four main characters. Both mothers and daughters have their strengths and weaknesses and feel like fully three dimensional people. At the end they all learn something. Lora Meredith learns to give up her love for acting to become a stay at home mom and spend more time with her daughter, Suzie. Suzie learns to respect and be grateful to her mother and give up her silly girlish fantasy love for Steve, Lora&#8217;s fianc&eacute;. Sarah Jane Johnson learns in the grand scheme of life, it&#8217;s not about the color of your skin; what matters is the character you show&#8212;how you treat the people around you. And Annie learns there comes a time in your child&#8217;s life where he/she&#8217;s going to make his/her own decisions and there&#8217;s nothing you can do about it. If your child is headstrong and stubborn you have to let them go and learn on their own even if means a couple hard knocks to make them see the light.Douglas Sirk&#8217;s (director) style is as some have said an acquired taste. The dialogue is occasionally a little corny &#8220;I&#8217;m going up, up and up and no one&#8217;s going to push me down.&#8221; &#8220;You&#8217;re bones are so perfect. My camera could easily have a love affair with you.&#8221; and Lora Meredith&#8217;s episodical acting career with all the men interested in her in the first half of the film is rather soap operatic and cringe inducing but all in all it&#8217;s an absorbing film with some really great messages and did an outstanding job making me care for the characters, especially Christ-like Annie Johnson. And I don&#8217;t think Lora was as shallow and air headed as some critics on the IMDB have said. After all, she did offer her home to Annie and Sarah Jane when they were homeless. Even though it was just a small three room apartment, she gave out of her poverty. And when Sarah Jane runs away and Annie is crying she strokes her shoulder and says &#8220;Aw, don&#8217;t worry Annie. We&#8217;ll bring her back.&#8221;The cast is uniformly excellent except perhaps the sugary, simpering characterization of Sandra Dee as the older Suzie&#8212;her syrupy tone of voice when she says &#8220;Oh look a falling star! Oh Mama, look! It&#8217;s Annie and Steve!&#8221; is a little irritating. Lana Turner (who looks a little bit like Eleanor Parker) is lovely as the stage actress Miss Lora and does a very good job showing her strengths and weaknesses. My favorite of her scenes are when she scolds Sarah Jane for the crawdads trick and when she&#8217;s watching over Annie&#8217;s deathbed. John Gavin (Steve) is solid in a role that doesn&#8217;t require him to do much more than stand around looking like a pretty boy clothing magazine model. The two child actors (Suzie and Sarah Jane) at the beginning are very good especially Karen Dicker as Sarah in the schoolroom and snowstorm scene.But this movie unquestionably belongs to Susan Kohner and Juanita Moore as the adult Sarah and Annie who do so much more with one facial expression than I&#8217;ve seen many actresses do with a whole script. They were both nominated for Best Supporting Actress and it's obvious that the Academy split the vote between them because they couldn&#8217;t decide who was better. The union boss/priest/older brother trio of nominees in On the Waterfront is another perfect example where the judges couldn&#8217;t decide who to give the trophy to because they all were so darn good. I have nothing against Shelley Winters as the grouchy, cantankerous Mrs. Van Daan in Anne Frank but for my money, Kohner and Moore were the true winners. It's a comparison of Good: Winters versus Spectacular: Kohner and Moore. If I had to split the vote between them, I'd give it to the non-nominated Haya Harareet in Ben-Hur who like Moore gave an equally beautiful portrayal of a strong devoted woman. Furthermore, Annie and Sarah Jane are more LEADING roles than supporting because the movie centers in on four characters&#8212;the two mothers and their daughters&#8212;and goes back and forth with their relationships. Remember folks, sometimes you can have MORE than one main character.I was touched beyond words at Juanita Moore&#8217;s acting and often wept at her performance. She gives a beautiful, subtle, fully-nuisanced performance as the strong, devout, stoic housekeeper. Her low, rich, creamy voice is always a pleasure to the ears--especially when she's telling the children the story of Mary, Joseph and Jesus. The scene where she goes up to her daughter's hotel room towards the climax and tells her that she'll always be there for her when she's in need never fails to move me. She plays motherly love, care, worry, sorrow, dismay and joy in a manner that is very real. Susan Kohner is likewise is believable at every turn as the bratty, rebellious, prodigal turned penitent especially in the hotel farewell scene and funeral. I challenge anyone not to hold a handkerchief during these two scenes.The costumes (especially Lana Turner's dresses) sets and cinematography are absolutely gorgeous and should have received Oscar nominations.I recommend this movie. Good for discussions.",4,A little corny but grand and awe-inspiring at times.,1390003200,"01 18, 2014",2014,7220,"['Academy', 'award', 'nominations', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Juanita', 'Moore',

492824,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000005XPV,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","Imitation of Life, a remake of the 1934 film by the same name, dazzled me. The acting was very convincing; when they say you'll need a few tissues to get through the ending, they mean it! Everyone gives it their all in this film and it shows. The choreography and cinematography shine; the musical score enhances the film as well. Moreover, the plot moves along nicely; I didn't feel like I was watching a two hour movie! My only disappointment is that the quality of the print wasn't that great; this film deserves a proper restoration!When the film starts, we meet widow and aspiring actress Lora Meredith (Lana Turner) with her daughter Susie (young Susie played by Terry Burnham) at Coney Island; Lora thinks Susie is lost and in possible danger until Lora sees that Susie was safe with a very sweet homeless African-American woman, Annie Johnson (Juanita Moore) and Annie's daughter Sara Jane (young Sara Jane played by Karin Dicker). Lora is grateful to Annie and she even invites Annie and Sara Jane to spend the night in her run-down apartment so they won't be on the street that night. However, Lora and Annie soon make good friends; and Lora agrees to let Annie and Sara Jane stay with her and Susie so Annie can essentially be Lora's maid and assistant and Sara Jane can go home every night after school instead of the street.  Lora trusts Annie to look after Susie and Sara Jane while she desperately searches for jobs as an actress.But there's more! Enter Steve Archer (John Gavin) who spots Lora on the beach when she was searching for Susie; he is a photographer and takes pictures of Lora, the girls and other people on the beach. Steve falls fast for Lora but Lora isn't sure if she wants to marry Steve; it all happens too fast for Lora. Steve is disappointed but hangs around at least for a while; and Lora tries to scratch her way to the top in the acting world despite a rough start with agent Allen Loomis (Robert Alda) and play write David Edwards (Dan O'Herlihy).The years fly; we see Lora climbing to the top of her profession as an actress--but there are problems. We see how Lora, the white woman, can climb the ladder while Annie, the black woman, remains the maid. Sixteen year old Susie (Sandra Dee), however, is not too happy about her mother's stardom; she bitterly resents the fact that her mother just doesn't have time for her. At the same time, Annie's now 18 year old daughter Sara Jane (Susan Kohner) wants to be white and since her missing father was ""nearly white"" Sara Jane spends her life trying to ""pass"" for white. Indeed, Sara Jane is so driven to be white that she scorns and rejects her mother Annie which causes trouble in the household, too.Of course, there's much more to the plot and I've already left out some of the story so you can be captivated and moved by the film just as I was! Suffice it to say that there are many important life lessons concerning a sharp and sorrowful racial divide and the importance of happiness that everyone must learn. The rest of the film shows how all the issues play out.The only bonus on the DVD is the theatrical trailer; I would have liked more.Imitation of Life features outstanding acting and a poignant story of its own that does not replicate the plot of the first version of the film. I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in it; people who enjoy dramas with social and cultural themes will not be disappointed.",4,"""How do you tell a child that she was born to be hurt?""",1362355200,"03 4, 2013",2013,3420,"['Imitation', 'Life', 'remake', '1934', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'dazzled', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'convincing', 'when', 'say', ""'ll"", 'need', 'few', 'tissues', 'get', 'ending', 'mean', 'Everyone', 'film', 'choreography', 'cinematography', 'shine', 'musical', 'score', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'Moreover', 'plot', 'moves', 'nicely', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'watching', 'two', 'hour', 'movie', 'only', 'disappointment', 'quality', 'print', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'film', 'proper', 'restoration', 'When', 'film', 'meet', 'widow', 'aspiring', 'actress', 'Lora', 'Meredith', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'daughter', 'Susie', 'young', 'Susie', 'played', 'Terry', 'Burnham', 'Coney', 'Island', 'Lora', 'Susie', 'lost', 'possible', 'danger', 'Lora', 'Susie', 'was', 'safe', 'very', 'sweet', 'homeless', 'African-American', 'woman', 'Annie', 'Johnson', 'Juanita', 'Moore', 'Annie', 'daughter', 'Sara', 'Jane', 'young', 'Sara', 'Jane', 'played', 'Karin', 'Dicker', 'Lora', 'grateful', 'Annie', 'even', 'Annie', 'Sara', 'Jane', 'spend', 'night', 'run-down', 'apartment', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'street', 'night', 'However', 'Lora', 'Annie', 'soon', 'make', 'good', 'friends', 'Lora', 'let', 'Annie', 'Sara', 'Jane', 'stay', 'Susie', 'so', 'Annie', 'can', 'essentially', 'be', 'Lora', 'maid', 'assistant', 'Sara', 'Jane', 'can', 'go', 'home', 'night', 'school', 'instead', 'street', 'Lora', 'Annie', 'look', 'Susie', 'Sara', 'Jane', 'desperately', 'jobs', 'actress.But', 'more', 'Enter', 'Steve', 'Archer', 'John', 'Gavin', 'who', 'spots', 'Lora', 'beach', 'when', 'was', 'searching', 'Susie', 'photographer', 'pictures', 'Lora', 'girls', 'other', 'people', 'beach', 'Steve', 'fast', 'Lora', 'Lora', ""n't"", 'sure', 'marry', 'Steve', 'too', 'fast', 'Lora', 'Steve', 'disappointed', 'hangs', 'least', 'while', 'Lora', 'tries', 'scratch', 'way', 'top', 'acting', 'world', 'rough', 'start', 'agent', 'Allen', 'Loomis', 'Robert', 'Alda', 'play', 'write', 'David', 'Edwards', 'Dan', ""O'Herlihy"", '.The', 'years', 'fly', 'see', 'Lora', 'climbing', 'top', 'profession', 'actress', 'are', 'problems', 'see', 'how', 'Lora', 'white', 'woman', 'can', 'climb', 'ladder', 'Annie', 'black', 'woman', 'maid', 'Sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'Susie', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'however', 'not', 'too', 'happy', 'mother', 'stardom', 'bitterly', 'fact', 'mother', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'same', 'time', 'Annie', 'now', '18', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Sara', 'Jane', 'Susan', 'Kohner', 'be', 'white', 'missing', 'father', 'was', 'nearly', 'white', 'Sara', 'Jane', 'life', 'trying', 'pass', 'white', 'Indeed', 'Sara', 'Jane', 'so', 'driven', 'be', 'white', 'mother', 'Annie', 'trouble', 'household', 'too.Of', 'course', 'much', 'more', 'plot', ""'ve"", 'already', 'left', 'out', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'captivated', 'moved', 'film', 'just', 'was', 'Suffice', 'say', 'are', 'many', 'important', 'life', 'lessons', 'concerning', 'sharp', 'sorrowful', 'racial', 'divide', 'importance', 'happiness', 'everyone', 'must', 'learn', 'rest', 'film', 'how', 'issues', 'play', 'only', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more.Imitation', 'Life', 'features', 'outstanding', 'acting', 'poignant', 'story', 'own', 'not', 'replicate', 'plot', 'first', 'version', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'fans', 'actors', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'dramas', 'social', 'cultural', 'themes', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",Imitation of Life VHS

In spite of the star presence of Lana Turner and John Gavin, this movie's heart lies in the story of Annie and her mulatto daughter, Sarah Jane.Director Douglas Sirk and his glamorized movies was the inspiration for the much acclaimed film, &quot;Far from Heaven.&quot;  One can see why Todd Hayes wanted to venture into this director's turf.  Ross Hunter's glitzy production begged for its audience to become embroiled in Lana's problems becoming a big actress.  But with the performances of Ms. Moore and Kohner, IMITATION OF LIFE achieves the status of one of our finest tearjerkers.

The term soap opera might very well have been coined for Sirk's unique blend of intense women's dramas with more than just a touch of the schmaltz laden in.  Here, Lana Turner stars as a rich socialite who's daughter becomes the best of friends with a little black girl, whose mother becomes Lana's maid. As puberty kicks in the girls run wild.  The little black girl passes for white and breaks her mother's heart.  Mahalia Jackson crops up at the end to do a rousing spiritual that really brings tears to the eyes.Unfortunately, so will Universal's really lousy transfer - bring tears to the eyes, that is!  The film is anamorphic widescreen but so full of digital grit, film grain, scratches, chips and tears inherent in the original camera negative that one wonders why Universal went to the trouble at all to give us this Sirk classic.  Some scenes appear quite sharp while others are so soft, blurry is an accurate description of the type of image quality you are in store for.  Colors are inconsistent and not very well balanced.  Blacks are muddy and indistinguishable from dark browns, blues or dark grays.  Flesh tones are entirely too, too orange.  The sound is a depressing mono and is strident, scratchy and ""ho-hum"" down right boring.  No extras either.

492837,A2UUYORVIZ00UH,B000005XPV,Noirdame,"[2, 3]","I have to say that I prefer this version to the 1934 Claudette Colbert film. Not only is it beautifully and lushly photographed, but all the performances are outstanding, as is the music.The story of a struggling widow and aspiring actress trying to raise her young daughter, and the black woman she befriends and the two become close as the years pass and their daughters' problems begin to surface. Lana Turner, as Lora Meredith, is radiant and plays the mixture of glamorous star and a mother trying to be the best she can be, but only complicates matters further by her ambition and work. Juanita Moore is heart-breaking as Annie Johnson, a devoted friend and loving mother whose heart is shattered when her frustrated, hurt and rebellious daughter, Sarah Jane (portrayed by the sultry and splendid Susan Kohner) discovers that her light-colored skin makes it easy for her to pass for white. The late, always lovely and perky Sandra Dee plays Lora's daughter Susie, who is longing for her mother's love and attention. And John Gavin as Lora's on-again, off-again suitor Steve Archer gives a strong, gentle and compassionate performance.The drama is wonderfully and sensitively presented: this was a time when the issue of racial inequality was a very real one, and many black or people of mixed race did pass for white, because they were ashamed of their background and wanted to fit in. Sarah Jane's attempts at this, which leads, among other things, to a relationship with Frankie (Troy Donahue, playing against type, in a brief but riveting scene), who beats her almost to a pulp when he discovers the truth. After that, she is constantly out searching for another way to escape her mother, her race, and herself. She feels inadequate compared to Susie, who appears to have all the advantages, and to Lora, who is successful and surrounded by the beautiful people. Her poor, ill mother is brought to despair, and finally makes the painful decision to let her daughter go. The scene in the hotel room had me weeping. Sarah Jane stares into the mirror, starting softly but repeats into a painful yell, ""I'm white. White. WHITE!"" When mother and daughter bid each other that heart-wrenching goodbye it was almost too much to bear. No wonder they were both Oscar-nominated. Turner is beautiful, and her realization that her daughter is in love with Steve, whom she is romantically involved with and is planning to marry, really throws her for a loop. When she comes to talk it out with Susie, this is when we see the anguish voiced, and we see Sandra Dee really come to life. Anyone who doubts her acting talent should see this movie. The argument starts out with her being angry and resentful, but then it culminates to her pain and sadness over her mother's neglect. (One can't help but compare the scene to Turner's troubled relationship with her own daughter, Cheryl). Susie calls her mother on ""playing the martyr"" and she confides in her mother that she wants some independence. Tears stream down her equisite, doll-like face.The climax, with the death of Annie, the grief that follows at her funeral lead by the marvelous Mahalia Jackson, and the poignant, tear-jerking return of Sarah Jane just sums this movie up. It gets me every time. It is now available on DVD, sometimes as a set with the 1934 version. Have fun comparing, but for both, Kleenex is mandatory!Update 2011: The special edition DVD has commentaries for both films as well as an interesting featurette where experts and surviving cast member Juanita Moore give insights and backgroud information on the times, the film and its stars.

492844,AVL5IDEE8YA3D,B000005XPV,Rachel McElhany,"[3, 3]","This remake is quite different from the 1934 original in several ways. Bea's character is now named Lora (Lana Turner) and is an aspiring actress in New York City. She meets Delilah's character, now named Annie (Juanita Moore), at the beach on Coney Island. Annie and her daughter Sarah Jane have recently become homeless and Lora agrees to take them in just for the night. Lora is a single mother supporting her daughter Susie and she can't afford to support Annie and Sarah Jane too. Annie gets a job washing shirts and she and her daughter end up staying. Eventually, Lora becomes a successful Broadway actress and is very wealthy. Annie's role in Lora's success is that she takes care of Susie while Lora is working. Lora works a lot so Annie is more of a mother to Susie than Lora is in most ways.Lora's romance with Steve Archer (John Gavin) is fraught with conflict in this movie. He can only be with her if she prioritizes him over her work and apparently that means not working at all. He's a good guy though; it's clear that this expectation is not unreasonable. It's Lora who is being unreasonable wanting to work when there is a perfectly good man wanting to take care of her. I wasn't expecting to find such a sexist subplot - the 1930s version portrayed women in a way better and stronger light!Sarah Jane's struggle with being a light-skinned black person has a bigger part in this movie than Peola's struggle in the original. I was disappointed that they did not cast a black person to play Sarah Jane. Susan Kohner did do a fabulous job playing Sarah Jane though and was nominated for both an Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress for the role. Sarah Jane is even more of a ""tragic mulatto"" in this movie and has quite a few dramatic scenes in which she talks about why she wants to be white.This movie address the issues of race in a more direct way than the original which I'm sure is a product of the time in which it was made. When Lora suggests that Annie talk to Sarah Jane about not trying to pass as white, Annie says, ""How do you explain to your child that she was born to be hurt?"" Like Delilah in the original movie, Annie wants a big funeral when she dies. She tells Lora to please invite all of Annie's friends. Lora looks surprised and tells Annie that she didn't know Annie had any friends besides her - very telling of the one-sided nature of their relationship.Another difference between the two movies that I must note is the heightened drama in the remake. Lana Turner chews the scenery every chance she gets and the score is very heavy handed. The melodramatic background music makes sure that the viewer is not confused when something VERY DRAMATIC is happening.This movie has all kinds of interesting movie star connections. Alan Alda's dad, Robert Alda, plays an agent. Troy Donahue, who was just starting out, has a small part as a real jerk - he was not dreamy at all in this movie. And Susan Kohler's son is Chris Weitz, the director of The Twilight Saga: New Moon.It was interesting to watch the two versions of Imitation of Life back to back and see how much (and how little) relationships between black people and white people changed over the twenty-five years between the two movies.",4,Imitation of Life 1959,1342137600,"07 13, 2012",2012,3252,"['remake', 'quite', 'different', '1934', 'original', 'several', 'ways', 'Bea', 'character', 'now', 'named', 'Lora', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'aspiring', 'actress', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Delilah', 'character', 'now', 'named', 'Annie', 'Juanita', 'Moore', 'beach', 'Coney', 'Island', 'Annie', 'daughter', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'have', 'recently', 'become', 'homeless', 'Lora', 'take', 'just', 'night', 'Lora', 'single', 'mother', 'supporting', 'daughter', 'Susie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'support', 'Annie', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'too', 'Annie', 'job', 'washing', 'shirts', 'daughter', 'end', 'up', 'staying', 'Eventually', 'Lora', 'successful', 'Broadway', 'actress', 'very', 'wealthy', 'Annie', 'role', 'Lora', 'success', 'care', 'Susie', 'Lora', 'working', 'Lora', 'lot', 'so', 'Annie', 'more', 'mother', 'Susie', 'Lora', 'most', 'ways.Lora', 'romance', 'Steve', 'Archer', 'John', 'Gavin', 'fraught', 'conflict', 'movie', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'work', 'apparently', 'not', 'working', 'good', 'guy', 'clear', 'expectation', 'not', 'unreasonable', 'Lora', 'who', 'being', 'unreasonable', 'wanting', 'work', 'when', 'perfectly', 'good', 'man', 'wanting', 'take', 'care', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'find', 'such', 'sexist', 'subplot', '1930s', 'version', 'portrayed', 'women', 'way', 'better', 'stronger', 'light', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'struggle', 'being', 'light-skinned', 'black', 'person', 'bigger', 'part', 'movie', 'Peola', 'struggle', 'original', 'was', 'disappointed', 'did', 'not', 'cast', 'black', 'person', 'play', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'Susan', 'Kohner', 'did', 'do', 'fabulous', 'job', 'playing', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'role', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'even', 'more', 'tragic', 'mulatto', 'movie', 'quite', 'few', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'why', 'be', 'white.This', 'movie', 'issues', 'race', 'more', 'direct', 'way', 'original', ""'m"", 'sure', 'product', 'time', 'was', 'made', 'When', 'Lora', 'Annie', 'talk', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'not', 'trying', 'pass', 'white', 'Annie', 'How', 'do', 'explain', 'child', 'was', 'born', 'be', 'hurt', 'Delilah', 'original', 'movie', 'Annie', 'big', 'funeral', 'when', 'Lora', 'please', 'invite', 'Annie', 'friends', 'Lora', 'surprised', 'Annie', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Annie', 'had', 'friends', 'very', 'telling', 'one-sided', 'nature', 'relationship.Another', 'difference', 'two', 'movies', 'must', 'note', 'heightened', 'drama', 'remake', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'scenery', 'chance', 'score', 'very', 'heavy', 'handed', 'melodramatic', 'background', 'music', 'sure', 'viewer', 'not', 'confused', 'when', 'something', 'VERY', 'DRAMATIC', 'happening.This', 'movie', 'kinds', 'interesting', 'movie', 'star', 'connections', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'dad', 'Robert', 'Alda', 'agent', 'Troy', 'Donahue', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'small', 'part', 'real', 'jerk', 'was', 'not', 'dreamy', 'movie', 'Susan', 'Kohler', 'son', 'Chris', 'Weitz', 'director', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'New', 'Moon.It', 'was', 'interesting', 'watch', 'two', 'versions', 'Imitation', 'Life', 'back', 'back', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'how', 'little', 'relationships', 'black', 'people', 'white', 'people', 'changed', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'two', 'movies']",Imitation of Life VHS
492845,A1EHO1C89QIBOT,B000005XPV,Randy Buck,"[2, 3]","Lana Turner was the reason for this 50's Universal remake of the Fannie Hurst perennial tearjerker, IMITATION OF LIFE.  She was fresh from daughter Cheryl Crane's trial for the murder of thug Johnny Stampanato, and producer Ross Hunter found the prospect of starring Lana in a saga of mother/daughter conflict commercially irresistable.  Ironically, to today's audiences, Lana's the least interesting element of the picture.  She gives her all as the Broadway star who's Too Busy With Her Career to really know daughter Sandra Dee (in a suprisingly fresh and thoughtful performance; Dee, so often better than you think she's going to be, is probably due for a critical reevaulation someday soon).  But Lana's all is too carefully lacquered to be of much interest.  Juanita Moore and Susan Kohner, both supporting-actress Oscar nominees for their work here, are the real deal.  Moore, as the long-suffering, too-good-to-be-true black maid, and Kohner, as her tragic daughter Sarah Jane, determined to ditch her mother and pass as white, take roles conceived (in this version, anyhow) in cardboard and elevate them to art.  Aided by Douglas Sirk's sympathetic direction, the mother/daughter scenes here are primal and heartrending.  Moore's California farewell to her daughter and subsequent death scene, and Kohner's guiltridden reappearance at the picture's end, would move a stone to tears.  Moore's subtle, shattering underplaying on her deathbed stands in sharp contrast to Lana's carefully-filtered histrionics.  Like Sirk's other 50's UI masterpieces, IMITATION is unafraid of melodrama, and its direct emotionalism still packs quite a punch.  Thanks to Lana, not the best of the Sirk bunch, but still essential viewing for students of popular culture or anyone who enjoys a three-hankie movie.",5,The Real Stuff,1043193600,"01 22, 2003",2003,1799,"['Lana', 'Turner', 'was', 'reason', '50', 'Universal', 'remake', 'Fannie', 'Hurst', 'perennial', 'tearjerker', 'IMITATION', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'was', 'fresh', 'daughter', 'Cheryl', 'Crane', 'trial', 'murder', 'thug', 'Johnny', 'Stampanato', 'producer', 'Ross', 'Hunter', 'found', 'prospect', 'starring', 'Lana', 'saga', 'mother/daughter', 'conflict', 'commercially', 'irresistable', 'Ironically', 'today', 'audiences', 'Lana', 'least', 'interesting', 'element', 'picture', 'Broadway', 'star', 'who', 'Too', 'Busy', 'Her', 'Career', 'really', 'know', 'daughter', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'suprisingly', 'fresh', 'thoughtful', 'performance', 'Dee', 'so', 'often', 'better', 'think', 'going', 'be', 'probably', 'due', 'critical', 'reevaulation', 'someday', 'soon', 'Lana', 'too', 'carefully', 'lacquered', 'be', 'much', 'interest', 'Juanita', 'Moore', 'Susan', 'Kohner', 'supporting-actress', 'Oscar', 'nominees', 'work', 'here', 'are', 'real', 'deal', 'Moore', 'long-suffering', 'too-good-to-be-true', 'black', 'maid', 'Kohner', 'tragic', 'daughter', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'determined', 'ditch', 'mother', 'pass', 'white', 'take', 'roles', 'conceived', 'version', 'anyhow', 'cardboard', 'elevate', 'art', 'Aided', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'sympathetic', 'direction', 'mother/daughter', 'scenes', 'here', 'are', 'primal', 'heartrending', 'Moore', 'California', 'farewell', 'daughter', 'subsequent', 'death', 'scene', 'Kohner', 'guiltridden', 'reappearance', 'picture', 'end', 'would', 'move', 'stone', 'tears', 'Moore', 'subtle', 'shattering', 'underplaying', 'deathbed', 'stands', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'Lana', 'carefully-filtered', 'histrionics', 'Sirk', 'other', '50', 'UI', 'masterpieces', 'IMITATION', 'unafraid', 'melodrama', 'direct', 'emotionalism', 'still', 'quite', 'punch', 'Thanks', 'Lana', 'not', 'best', 'Sirk', 'bunch', 'still', 'essential', 'viewing', 'students', 'popular', 'culture', 'anyone', 'who', 'three-hankie', 'movie']",Imitation of Life VHS

492849,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,B000005XPV,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[3, 5]","'Imitation of Life' is the story of Lora Meredith (Lana Turner), a struggling actress who makes it big, her maid/friend Annie Johnson (Juanita Moore), who comes to live with Annie and ends up staying for the rest of her life, and their respective daughters Susie and Sarah Jane.A remake of the 1934 version of the same name, 'Imitation of Life' is still an excellent testimony to the powers of love and ambition. Lana Turner does a decent job with the role of Lora, playing her hard-nosed ambitious character with a decent amount of flintiness. She never seems to be totally believable as a career-driven working mother, though, and this is due to the fact that her scenes with daughter Susie (played with gusto for the most part by Sandra Dee) are tender and beautifully-portrayed. An underrated actress at the best of times, Ms. Turner turns in a beautifully emotional performance at the end of the picture.In her role as Annie, Juanita Moore excels. Although the premise of the film is now sorely dated, and much of the early situations are by now, frankly, unbelievable, Moore brings a depth of emotion and realism to the part that was previously unseen. Her love for her troubled, ungrateful daughter Sarah Jane will strike a chord with parents and children alike, and Moore's considerable talent as an actress prevents any of the character's key scenes from becoming sentimental.Sandra Dee as Susie is decent enough, a somewhat spoiled rich kid with a heart of gold, and she plays the part with an endearing energy and innocence, but it's Susan Kohner as Sarah Jane that is a true revelation. She is a powerful and emotional actress, sultry and seductive with the hallmark of a great talent. Her private exchanges with her Mother in Las Vegas, and her boyfriend in New York, are portrayed with realism and pathos. She's probably one of cinema's early anti-heroes, we can't but help feel sympathy for her at certain points in the picture. It's a rare thing to find such a young actress cast in such a demanding role, and it could so easily have been a monotonous performance (the part of Sarah Jane doesn't really call for a range of emotion) but thanks to Kohner, it becomes something real, something believable.To note, the extraordinary and unusual Mahalia Jackson, credited on the packaging, only has one tiny cameo, but she's astonishing in her scene.Overall, 'Imitation of Life' is an excellent movie, but there is something of a disjointed feel to it, too. It moves from corny to real quite often (this is not the fault of the Principles, rather a script that has not aged well) and the unintentional racism that is prevalent throughout. It's not a pro-Slavery storyline at all, but political messages in all films of this era are bound to now be redundant. If you can overlook this fact, however, 'Imitation' is a marvellous film.Direction is decent enough, the 'plastic-fantastic' feel of the late 1950's-style sets and the sometimes garish technicolour of the movie somewhat detracts from the melodrama, but director Douglas Sirk does a great job in exacting wonderfully photogenic performances from his leading ladies, and this does redress the balance somewhat.The DVD itself is not loaded with special features, but then again it isn't the sort of movie that needs them. Audio and visual quality is decent enough, but the original print is in desperate need of restoration, but there is only a small amount of moments where this is noticable.The only drawbacks with 'Imitation of Life' are the premise, and  the racism that it invariably invokes. If you can accept the beginning of the story, and overlook the lack of political correctness so typical of this genre, you'll find a very emotional, beautifully-crafted film that is possibly Ms. Turner's finest hour.

Although it is estimated she has been read by a half billion people, an even greater number have seen the movies made from her bestselling novels, which include 'Back Street' (made three times),'Imitation of Life' (twice), 'Humoresque' (twice), 'Symphony of Six Million,' and 'Lummox.' 'Imitation of Life' marked an important career comeback for Lana Turner whose private life had been engulfed in tragedy one year before... It also enclosed an interesting exploration of race relations given considerable depth and style through Sirk's polished direction...Impeccably photographed by Russell Metty (Spartacus, 1960), the major script revisions included the change of the central character from the 'Pancake Queen"" business woman of the original to the more characteristic occupation of a resplendent Broadway actress... Her black business partner was transformed into the actress' housekeeper-companion to bring her character out of the outmoded colored 'mammy' stereotype of the original...Even the credits for 'Imitation of Life' have a different look. As the Universal logo fades, a handful of diamonds slowly fall from the top of the screen in the manner of raindrops... By the time the credits have finished, the entire screen is ready to overflow with them... From this blinding introduction, the film suddenly shifts to the beach at Coney Island where its four chief protagonists meet...Lora Meredith, an attractive widow with theatrical aspirations, has lost her 6-year-old daughter, Susie, in the crowds... She finally locates her in the company of Annie Johnson, a kind but impoverished black woman, and her light-skinned daughter, Sarah Jane, who had been playing with Susie... Before long Annie goes to work as a housekeeper for Lora and a deep bond of affection develops between them and their children...Encouraged by an agent (Robert Alda), Lora gets a good role in a play by David Edwards... In the years that follow, she becomes the darling of Broadway and appears in one Edwards smash after another. But success means work... and work means neglecting Susie, now sixteen, who must endure the loneliness of a youngster whose mother is too busy being a star...A good-looking photographer, Steve Archer (John Gavin), is the determined, admiring love of Lora's life but he too must wait and suffer for her affection... Meanwhile, Annie has her problems as well...Surrounded by luxury, her daughter, Sarah Jane, is resentful of the segregation and restrictions on her future imposed by her race...

Lana Turner stars as an aspiring actress who makes it big in spite of her age and the fact that she has a young daughter (Sandra Dee). In times of poverty, she meets Juanita Moore, a kindly black woman with a daughter of her own (Susan Kohner). This little girl is so light skinned, she could pass as white, and does on many occasions. She is ashamed of her mother and acts out constantly. However, she and Turner's daughter are close friends, and Moore takes care of the family nicely.We are shown that mothers with careers are almost always doomed to fail. When one is focused on, the other is neglected.

492859,A14HHOT9999Z22,B000005XPV,"Stephen M. Moser ""The Austin Chronicle""","[3, 7]","Dearly Beloved, we are gathered here to pay immaculate homage to one of the major Kweenie Klassix of the last century, Ross Hunter's production of *Imitation of Life*. Based on the Fannie Hurst story, it is remake of the original 1934 version that starred Claudette Colbert, as ""the pancake queen."" Well, the pancake queen may be fine for Claudette, but certainly not for Lana Turner, who, in this version, plays a Broadway actress named Lora Meredith. We have to face facts: the star machine made Lana look great, but nothing helped her acting. She was dreadful, and far too mannered ever really become her characters. But she was straw turned into gold - the consummate Hollywood star, completely manufactured, with lush, bosom-heaving vehicles designed especially for her. Though only after Lana's 14 year-old daughter, the notorious Cheryl Crane, stabbed Lana's gangster boyfriend to death, did Lana develop the ability to make the characters become herself. The cannibalistic studios went into overdrive with projects that took advantage of Lana's infamy. *Peyton Place* was still in the theatres, and support for Lana throughout her tragedy was profound.On the heels of this, came *Imitation of Life*, the story of a struggling young actress single-handedly raising a daughter Susie (Dee). They meet up with a lovely, well-spoken homeless woman, Annie (Moore) who is black, and her two-toned daughter, Sarah Jane (Kohner) who hates her blackness more than anything on earth. Annie, who doesn't know how to take ""no"" for an answer, insinuates the lives of her daughter and herself into those of Lora and Susie, and stays with them through the lean years until Lora's a huge success. The ""young"" part is the most treacherous for Lana - her character ages 20 years by simply removing her bandana, and the strange part is, the fashions never change over the course of those twenty years. Let's do a little movie arithmetic, shall we? At the end of the film, Lana's character, Lora, is a major star with a grown daughter, so we can presume that part takes in the present day of 1959. In theory, most of the early action would occur in the 40s. There is absolutely zero indication of time passing, except when they pull the old switch-a-roo with the daughters, substituting Dee and Kohner for the younger actresses who played them in the opening. But, of course, it would be a number of years in the future (until 1966's *Madame X*) before Lana would be allowed to actually age onscreen.According to Lana's daughter, Cheryl, Lana instructed her to ""walk as if she had a nickel tucked between her buttocks."" Lana demonstrates this technique throughout out the entire film, and it is this same tight-assed approach to acting that makes Lana one of the most fulfilling bad actresses to watch (my mother once pointed out that Lana Turner's name spelled backward was Anal Renrut). Her acting, or better yet, posturing, is strictly by-the-book, but she gives the viewer everything they could desire from the glamour standpoint. Sandra Dee is her usual bubbly self and the dynamics between her and her mother never raise fireworks until the end, but the Kohner-Moore combination is spectacular. The long-suffering Moore made a career out of parts like this, but nothing surpasses Annie's dedication to the Great White Lady Benefactress, Lora Meredith. Kohner's as Annie's daughter Sarah Jane is fabulous - a trashy, tawdry little ingrate who feels she's entitled to everything Susie has. What she doesn't have, and will never have, is Susie's lily-white skin, but that doesn't stop her from `passing.' Annie confides to Miz Lora, ""How do you explain to your child that she was born to be hurt?"" Sarah Jane's white boyfriend (Troy Donahue) beats her to a pulp when he finds out, and she eventually runs off to be a showgirl. Annie tracks her down, and begs her to come home, but is completely rejected, breaking her heart and returning to Miz Lora's with one foot on the grave. Meanwhile, Miz Lora's been romanced by the handsome Steve Archer (Gavin), but he wants her to settle down and be his wife and give her a home. ""I want more than that,"" she tells him, ""I want everything."" They break-up even though he loves her from afar. She parades around in her Jean Louis gowns, with an array of abusive and manipulative men (this is where it becomes hard to distinguish Lora, the character, from Lana, the actress), all of whom help her up the ladder to the pinnacle of stardom. Years later, Lora runs into Steve again, and their love burns brightly anew. As Susie's graduating from school, Lora's flying off to Italy to make some horrid little film, and appoints Steve as chaperone for Susie while she's gone. In a *Mildred Pierce*-ish turn of events (or better yet, a ""Rikki Lake""-ish turn of events), Susie falls in love with her mother's boyfriend, and there are all kinds of mother/daughter problems. Annie's slipping away quietly, but not without planning the grandest funeral - one rivaled only by that of Princess Diana. With weeping crowds, prancing horses and the incomparable Mahalia Jackson singing ""Trouble of the World"" Annie is dispatched to her great reward, but not before her turncoat daughter shows up and hurls herself on the casket sobbing and wailing. This watershed moment is one of the most well-loved scenes in movie history.The film is Douglas Sirk's (*Written On The Wind* and *Magnificent Obsession*) appropriately lavish farewell to Hollywood. It is camp at its finest and remained Universal biggest moneymaker until *Jaws* in 1975. Though Leonard Maltin says ""Fine performances and direction overcome possible soapiness to make this quite credible and moving,"" and gives it 3.5 stars, I'd give it 5 stars - but there is no solar system in which this movie could be called credible. Credibility is something we simply do not expect out of Lana Turner. What we want out of her is the fantasy of the Hollywood Sex Goddess and she gives us that in spades.",5,Always Lana,1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,5971,"['Dearly', 'Beloved', 'are', 'gathered', 'here',

They strike up a friendship, and soon, they are sharing each other's joys and pains. Lana Turner is the struggling actress that turns her back on love and neglects her daughter (Sandra Dee) for a career...Eventually she becomes successful, but there is a price to be paid for it. Juanita Moore is fantastic as the long-suffering domestic  that tries to instill black pride in her angry, light-skinned daughter (Susan Kohner), who despises her race and wants to distance herself from her mother by passing for white.
