999159,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,B000G6BM1E,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[0, 0]","Although I couldn't find much in the way of production notes to back me up, I assume that this film had a very limited budget due to the look of the movie and the style in which it was shot.  With that in mind, I was impressed with what the filmmakers were able to accomplish.  Independent films shot on digital video may be an acquired taste, but if the viewer can get past the look of the film, then there are some absolute story gems waiting for them.  Unfortunately, not all well-made films are gems.The plot for 'Cavite' is straightforward.  A young Filipino-American man, stuck in a dead end job and in the middle of breaking up with his girlfriend, receives a phone call from his mother in the Philippines informing him that his father is dead.  The young man, Adam, flies back to his country of birth for the funeral, but when he arrives, he gets another phone call - this time from a cell phone hidden in his luggage.  The voice on the other end tells him that his mother and sister are hostages, and their lives depend on Adam following the voice's every whim and direction.It isn't long before Adam discovers that the voice belongs to a member of the Philippine terrorist organization Abu Sayyaf.  After being forced to take a guided tour of the slums of his native land at the voice's insistence, Adam is eventually given the task that, if he successfully fulfills it, will obligate the voice to release Adam's mother and sister.What makes this film chilling is that it seems so very plausible.  A poor slob, with no real direction in life, is suddenly caught up in something much larger than himself, and his reactions are completely believable to me.  Even worse, the method used to control Adam is brutal, efficient, and simple.  He is held completely in their power.There are several disturbing aspects to this film, one of which is the living conditions the filmmakers chose to spotlight during Adam's travels.  For someone unfamiliar with images of third world poverty, this film will certainly illuminate that blind spot.  But even more than that, though I found the film's premise conceivable and persuasive (and relevant), the pervasive atmosphere of powerlessness was difficult to watch.  It reminded me of the 'home invasion/torture' genre, where the protagonist twists in the wind at the torturer's pleasure.Yes - I fully believe these things happen, and as such are quite legitimate subjects for artists.  However, one or two films of this sort go a long, long way for me.  There are too many other stimulating topics to explore in my limited time frame.  Not to say that 'Cavite' is in the same gleefully bloodthirsty strata as films such as 'Hostel' and its ilk, but that aura is still there.The picture on the DVD case may be a still from the movie, but I don't recall it, and it lends an air of violence about the movie that just isn't there.  Instead, the violence is off-screen and in Adam's (and our) head.  That doesn't make it any less effective - in fact it may be more so.  In that way, 'Cavite' is a taut, well-made film - about a young man reduced to abject impotence in an entirely believable manner.  While that sort of thing has its place, had I known it before renting I probably would have said, ""Thanks - but no thanks.""",4,"An accomplished film, but...",1243641600,"05 30, 2009",2009,3264,"['could', ""n't"", 'find', 'much', 'way', 'production', 'notes', 'back', 'assume', 'film', 'had', 'very', 'limited', 'budget', 'due', 'look', 'movie', 'style', 'was', 'shot', 'mind', 'was', 'impressed', 'what', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'able', 'accomplish', 'Independent', 'films', 'shot', 'digital', 'video', 'may', 'be', 'acquired', 'taste', 'viewer', 'can', 'get', 'look', 'film', 'then', 'are', 'absolute', 'story', 'gems', 'waiting', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'well-made', 'films', 'are', 'gems.The', 'plot', ""'Cavite"", 'straightforward', 'young', 'Filipino-American', 'man', 'stuck', 'dead', 'end', 'job', 'middle', 'breaking', 'up', 'girlfriend', 'phone', 'call', 'mother', 'Philippines', 'informing', 'father', 'dead', 'young', 'man', 'Adam', 'back', 'country', 'birth', 'funeral', 'when', 'phone', 'call', 'time', 'cell', 'phone', 'hidden', 'luggage', 'voice', 'other', 'end', 'mother', 'sister', 'are', 'hostages', 'lives', 'depend', 'Adam', 'following', 'voice', 'whim', 'direction.It', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'Adam', 'discovers', 'voice', 'belongs', 'member', 'Philippine', 'terrorist', 'organization', 'Abu', 'Sayyaf', 'being', 'forced', 'take', 'guided', 'tour', 'slums', 'native', 'land', 'voice', 'insistence', 'Adam', 'eventually', 'given', 'task', 'successfully', 'will', 'obligate', 'voice', 'release', 'Adam', 'mother', 'sister.What', 'film', 'chilling', 'so', 'very', 'plausible', 'poor', 'slob', 'real', 'direction', 'life', 'suddenly', 'caught', 'up', 'something', 'much', 'larger', 'reactions', 'are', 'completely', 'believable', 'Even', 'worse', 'method', 'used', 'control', 'Adam', 'brutal', 'efficient', 'simple', 'held', 'completely', 'power.There', 'are', 'several', 'disturbing', 'aspects', 'film', 'one', 'living', 'conditions', 'filmmakers', 'chose', 'spotlight', 'Adam', 'travels', 'someone', 'unfamiliar', 'images', 'third', 'world', 'poverty', 'film', 'will', 'certainly', 'illuminate', 'blind', 'spot', 'even', 'more', 'found', 'film', 'premise', 'conceivable', 'persuasive', 'relevant', 'pervasive', 'atmosphere', 'powerlessness', 'was', 'difficult', 'watch', 'reminded', ""'home"", 'invasion/torture', 'genre', 'where', 'protagonist', 'twists', 'wind', 'torturer', 'pleasure.Yes', 'fully', 'believe', 'things', 'happen', 'such', 'are', 'quite', 'legitimate', 'subjects', 'artists', 'However', 'one', 'two', 'films', 'sort', 'go', 'long', 'long', 'way', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'other', 'stimulating', 'topics', 'explore', 'limited', 'time', 'frame', 'Not', 'say', ""'Cavite"", 'same', 'gleefully', 'bloodthirsty', 'strata', 'films', 'such', ""'Hostel"", 'ilk', 'aura', 'still', 'there.The', 'picture', 'DVD', 'case', 'may', 'be', 'still', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'air', 'violence', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'there', 'Instead', 'violence', 'off-screen', 'Adam', 'head', ""n't"", 'make', 'less', 'effective', 'fact', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'so', 'way', ""'Cavite"", 'taut', 'well-made', 'film', 'young', 'man', 'reduced', 'abject', 'impotence', 'entirely', 'believable', 'manner', 'sort', 'thing', 'place', 'had', 'known', 'renting', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'said', 'Thanks', 'thanks']",Cavite

999162,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000G6BM1E,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Made on empty pockets budgeting, shot on location without bothering with permits, and poking at an idealogical hornet's nest, CAVITE turns out to be gripping and baffling, unsettling and nerve-wracking. It's also thought-provoking stuff and demonstrates once again that a shoestring allowance does sometimes lend the project a palpable sense of immediacy, as well as this jangling energy. It's a taut little thriller.Co-writers/directors/producers Neill Dela Llana and Ian Gamazon pretty much make up the cast and crew. Acting-wise, CAVITE is in essence a one-man show (with Gamazon playing the lead role of Adam), although he gets terrific supporting vocals coming off-screen. Adam is a 32-year-old Filipino muddling thru his zero-prospect life in San Diego, California. Trapped in his dead-end gig as a night security guard and currently in a serious spat with his pregnant girlfriend, Adam learns that his father had just died, killed in a bus explosion back home in the Philippines. Flying out for the funeral, Adam gets even more stressed out when no one meets him at the Philippines airport. So things probably cannot get any worse. Heh.A phone rings, and Adam is startled to realize that a cell phone has been planted in his luggage. He answers the cell phone and a taunting voice informs him that his mother and sister had been abducted and will be murdered unless Adam complies with the caller's instructions. Adam's homecoming, it really sucks.This movie is a big migraine for tourism agencies in Cavite City. The disembodied voice forces Adam to trudge thru the slums of Cavite, to some eventual destination. But, until then, we are treated -no, not treated - we're exposed to a nightmarish exploration of the elements constituting a woefully destitute nation: the cramped avenues, the dangerous alleys, and fetid waterways, the squatter zones and the stinking heaps of garbage. There's a deep and sad irony here when one considers that Cavite happens to be the birthplace of Filipino independence back in 1898.Everyone in the audience can sympathize with what Adam endures. Not that the guy's that likable a character - he's actually kind of a tool - and, in fact, the voice's exasperated asides regarding Adam had me chuckling a bit. One of the film's more prominent themes is that of cultural identity. Adam is one of those cats who's uncomfortable with his native tongue, though he understands it perfectly. He's uneasy about being back home, and it's not just because he's here for a funeral and then as a terrorist's pawn. The sense we get is that Adam thinks of himself as more American than Filipino, and so now finds himself alienated from his native culture. The voice on the phone notes this and, being a sadistic bastard, not only makes fun of Adam but forces him to munch on a Filipino delicacy called balut, which is a fertilized duck egg (it's gross but disturbingly good; I've had 'em). Later on, when the voice instructs him to take a break and buy a soda, Adam does so and watches the vendor pour the soda bottle's contents into a plastic bag so that the soda bottle can be re-used. It's clear that, for whatever reason, the voice means to impart certain lessons, and this is only one of several intended to point out the sheer poverty of the country abandoned by Adam.CAVITE also touches on the hot button issue of religion. The Philippines is predominantly Catholic-based, but the Islam faith has been making inroads. Adam is a lapsed Muslim. The voice is that of a Muslim extremist. Not too surprising then that the voice and Adam eventually get into a fierce debate regarding religion, warring philosophies, and personal beliefs.The film generates a jittery, panicky vibe, and this is in part due to the hand-held camera utilized to shoot the thing. Despite the dearth of action sequences, the tension mounts and mounts. Partly it's because Adam's tormentor just seems so omniscient and the protagonist so out of his depth. Each of Adam's little acts of rebellion results in futility and dire consequences, and you feel a growing concern as the movie progresses and our guy is just not able to get the upper hand. And I guess this is more realistic. Not too many of us are as resourceful as John McClane.The resolution is unconventional and, to some, perhaps unsatisfying. The epilogue comes off like extraneous material and anti-climactic. And we never do learn how the kidnappers are able to so closely track Adam visually. Other than those, and if you overlook the low budget aesthetics, then CAVITE, lean and edgy, is well worth a look, especially if you're curious for a long, unflinching look at how bleak and brutal life can be for a huge chunk of those inhabiting the Philippines.",4,worst tour ever,1260576000,"12 12, 2009",2009,4721,"['Made', 'empty', 'pockets', 'budgeting', 'shot', 'location', 'bothering', 'permits', 'poking', 'idealogical', 'hornet', 'nest', 'CAVITE', 'out', 'be', 'gripping', 'baffling', 'unsettling', 'nerve-wracking', 'also', 'thought-provoking', 'stuff', 'once', 'again', 'shoestring', 'allowance', 'sometimes', 'lend', 'project', 'palpable', 'sense', 'immediacy', 'as', 'well', 'jangling', 'energy', 'taut', 'little', 'thriller.Co-writers/directors/producers', 'Neill', 'Dela', 'Llana', 'Ian', 'Gamazon', 'pretty', 'much', 'make', 'up', 'cast', 'crew', 'Acting-wise', 'CAVITE', 'essence', 'one-man', 'show', 'Gamazon', 'playing', 'lead', 'role', 'Adam', 'terrific', 'supporting', 'vocals', 'coming', 'off-screen', 'Adam', '32-year-old', 'Filipino', 'muddling', 'thru', 'zero-prospect', 'life', 'San', 'Diego', 'California', 'Trapped', 'dead-end', 'gig', 'night', 'security', 'guard', 'currently', 'serious', 'spat', 'pregnant', 'girlfriend', 'Adam', 'father', 'had', 'just', 'died', 'killed', 'bus', 'explosion', 'back', 'home', 'Philippines', 'Flying', 'out', 'funeral', 'Adam', 'even', 'more', 'stressed', 'out', 'when', 'one', 'Philippines', 'airport', 'things', 'probably', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'worse', 'Heh.A', 'phone', 'rings', 'Adam', 'startled', 'realize', 'cell', 'phone', 'been', 'planted', 'luggage', 'cell', 'phone', 'taunting', 'voice', 'informs', 'mother', 'sister', 'had', 'been', 'abducted', 'will', 'be', 'murdered', 'Adam', 'complies', 'caller', 'instructions', 'Adam', 'homecoming', 'really', 'sucks.This', 'movie', 'big', 'migraine', 'tourism', 'agencies', 'Cavite', 'City', 'disembodied', 'voice', 'forces', 'Adam', 'trudge', 'thru', 'slums', 'Cavite', 'eventual', 'destination', 'then', 'are', 'treated', '-no', 'not', 'treated', ""'re"", 'exposed', 'nightmarish', 'exploration', 'elements', 'constituting', 'woefully', 'destitute', 'nation', 'cramped', 'avenues', 'dangerous', 'alleys', 'fetid', 'waterways', 'squatter', 'zones', 'stinking', 'heaps', 'garbage', 'deep', 'sad', 'irony', 'here', 'when', 'one', 'Cavite', 'be', 'birthplace', 'Filipino', 'independence', 'back', '1898.Everyone', 'audience', 'can', 'sympathize', 'what', 'Adam', 'Not', 'guy', 'character', 'actually', 'kind', 'tool', 'fact', 'voice', 'exasperated', 'asides', 'regarding', 'Adam', 'had', 'chuckling', 'bit', 'One', 'film', 'more', 'prominent', 'themes', 'cultural', 'identity', 'Adam', 'one', 'cats', 'who', 'uncomfortable', 'native', 'tongue', 'perfectly', 'uneasy', 'being', 'back', 'home', 'not', 'just', 'here', 'funeral', 'then', 'terrorist', 'pawn', 'sense', 'get', 'Adam', 'thinks', 'more', 'American', 'Filipino', 'so', 'now', 'alienated', 'native', 'culture', 'voice', 'phone', 'being', 'sadistic', 'bastard', 'not', 'only', 'fun', 'Adam', 'munch', 'Filipino', 'delicacy', 'called', 'balut', 'fertilized', 'duck', 'egg', 'gross', 'disturbingly', 'good', ""'ve"", 'had', ""'em"", 'Later', 'when', 'voice', 'take', 'break', 'buy', 'soda', 'Adam', 'so', 'vendor', 'pour', 'soda', 'bottle', 'contents', 'plastic', 'bag', 'soda', 'bottle', 'can', 'be', 're-used', 'clear', 'reason', 'voice', 'impart', 'certain', 'lessons', 'only', 'one', 'several', 'intended', 'point', 'out', 'sheer', 'poverty', 'country', 'abandoned', 'Adam.CAVITE', 'also', 'hot', 'button', 'issue', 'religion', 'Philippines', 'predominantly', 'Catholic-based', 'Islam', 'faith', 'been', 'making', 'inroads', 'Adam', 'lapsed', 'Muslim', 'voice', 'Muslim', 'extremist', 'Not', 'too', 'surprising', 'then', 'voice', 'Adam', 'eventually', 'get', 'fierce', 'debate', 'regarding', 'religion', 'warring', 'philosophies', 'personal', 'beliefs.The', 'film', 'jittery', 'panicky', 'vibe', 'part', 'due', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'utilized', 'shoot', 'thing', 'dearth', 'action', 'sequences', 'tension', 'mounts', 'mounts', 'Partly', 'Adam', 'tormentor', 'just', 'so', 'omniscient', 'protagonist', 'depth', 'Adam', 'little', 'acts', 'rebellion', 'results', 'futility', 'dire', 'consequences', 'feel', 'growing', 'concern', 'movie', 'guy', 'just', 'not', 'able', 'get', 'upper', 'hand', 'guess', 'more', 'realistic', 'Not', 'too', 'many', 'are', 'as', 'resourceful', 'John', 'McClane.The', 'resolution', 'unconventional', 'perhaps', 'unsatisfying', 'epilogue', 'extraneous', 'material', 'anti-climactic', 'never', 'do', 'learn', 'how', 'kidnappers', 'are', 'able', 'so', 'closely', 'track', 'Adam', 'visually', 'Other', 'overlook', 'low', 'budget', 'aesthetics', 'then', 'CAVITE', 'lean', 'edgy', 'well', 'look', 'especially', ""'re"", 'curious', 'long', 'unflinching', 'look', 'how', 'bleak', 'brutal', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'huge', 'chunk', 'inhabiting', 'Philippines']",Cavite

There isn't a single firearm to be seen in ""Cavite"", but then there's no need for one.Adam is returning to the Philipines, to attend his Father's funeral. When he lands at the Manila Airport, there is no one to greet him. Instead, he receives a phone call from someone stating that if he does not comply with the following instructions, his Mother and Sister will be killed.From here, it's a non-stop marathon through the streets of Manila. Adam's instructions at times, are a bit vague, but rest assured that his caller has eyes on his progress (how he can be followed in certain parts of the city without his ""tail"" being seen and identified is puzzling).About halfway through the film, you want the film to end. Not that it's boring, mind you, but you get the feeling that things should escalate. They don't, and the ending is not what you may have expected (which is the reason for four stars).""Cavite"" is an interesting film that is akin to a quick tour of Manila, by foot.

There is a scene in the movie where the park is named after him.The filmakers definitely know Filipino culture.  There is a scene where the song ""Mr. Suave"" by Parokya ni Edgar when even the antigonist sings to the tune.  Mr. Suave is a hugely popular song by the band that is widely considered as the national band of the Philippines as of the date of this review.  They would only know of this if they were au courant with the goings on on the Philippines.  They are also knowledgable of the political climate of the Philippines.  The conspirators while never named, are in the ilk of Abu Sayaff or the Moro Islamic Liberation Front.  So with this in mind the filmakers weave a story that they know intimately and therefore is meaningful for any outsider that may have doubts about the authenticity of portraying the culture.  And they may not show the best of Filipino society, nonetheless this is a how a big part of the Filipino masses live.The filmaking itself, in my opinion, is not that great but not bad either.
