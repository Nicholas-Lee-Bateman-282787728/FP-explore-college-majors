1019488,AQIO9QHHPFFET,B000I8OMEY,Brendan M. Howard,"[28, 28]","It's true, we've all seen crimes-go-wrong scenarios before. However, writer-director Nicolas Winding Refn does a wonderful job of focusing his camera on single characters in each film and bringing out the drama of crooks and pushers getting in over their head in some of the worst days of their lives.In Pusher, drug middleman Frank tries to sort out a mess when he winds up owing too much to local drug kingpin Milo.Pusher II plays like an Oedipal tragedy minus the mom, with Frank's friend Tonny taking center stage. Tonny gets out of jail and tries to ingratiate himself into the crime business of his cruel father with predictably disastrous results.Pusher III returns to Milo, an important character in each of the previous films, as he ages and is challenged by new blood in the drug business and new challenges as he negotiates his daughter's 25th birthday party, her wanting to get in on the action, bad drug deals, prostitution and murder.All three films play perfectly together, with recurring characters, similar themes and believable violence. The criminals are humanized in a way that doesn't let audiences off the hook, as with Trainspotting's reluctantly violent druggies. These are the dealers with cool heads who have chosen this line of work and do terrible things. Yet, at the end of the day or week, Winding Refn has let us walk in their shoes enough to see the fallibility and humanity in what 90 minutes before we might have regarded as unconscionable evil. If you want to sympathize with these characters, you'll have to admit you see a little darkness in yourself, too.P.S. The tale of how Pusher II and III came to be is almost as cool as the films. It's covered in the documentary Gambler here, which follows him and his associates as they struggle to put together funding for the two films, not to get paid, but just to break even and climb out of moviemaking bankruptcy. Also cool are two featurettes explore how Winding Refn picked amateurs or almost-amateurs for most of the gritty roles in the last two films.",4,"Pusher Is Great, II and III are Oedipal excellence",1163376000,"11 13, 2006",2006,2040,"['true', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'crimes-go-wrong', 'scenarios', 'However', 'writer-director', 'Nicolas', 'Winding', 'Refn', 'wonderful', 'job', 'focusing', 'camera', 'single', 'characters', 'film', 'bringing', 'out', 'drama', 'crooks', 'pushers', 'getting', 'head', 'worst', 'days', 'lives.In', 'Pusher', 'drug', 'middleman', 'Frank', 'sort', 'out', 'mess', 'when', 'up', 'owing', 'too', 'much', 'local', 'drug', 'kingpin', 'Milo.Pusher', 'II', 'Oedipal', 'tragedy', 'minus', 'mom', 'Frank', 'friend', 'Tonny', 'taking', 'center', 'stage', 'Tonny', 'jail', 'tries', 'ingratiate', 'crime', 'business', 'cruel', 'father', 'predictably', 'disastrous', 'results.Pusher', 'III', 'Milo', 'important', 'character', 'previous', 'films', 'challenged', 'new', 'blood', 'drug', 'business', 'new', 'challenges', 'daughter', '25th', 'birthday', 'party', 'wanting', 'get', 'action', 'bad', 'drug', 'deals', 'prostitution', 'murder.All', 'three', 'films', 'play', 'perfectly', 'together', 'recurring', 'characters', 'similar', 'themes', 'believable', 'violence', 'criminals', 'are', 'humanized', 'way', ""n't"", 'let', 'audiences', 'off', 'hook', 'Trainspotting', 'reluctantly', 'violent', 'druggies', 'are', 'dealers', 'cool', 'heads', 'who', 'have', 'chosen', 'line', 'work', 'do', 'terrible', 'things', 'Yet', 'end', 'day', 'week', 'Winding', 'Refn', 'let', 'walk', 'shoes', 'enough', 'see', 'fallibility', 'humanity', 'what', '90', 'minutes', 'might', 'have', 'regarded', 'unconscionable', 'evil', 'want', 'sympathize', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'have', 'admit', 'see', 'little', 'darkness', 'too.P.S', 'tale', 'how', 'Pusher', 'II', 'III', 'came', 'be', 'almost', 'as', 'cool', 'films', 'covered', 'documentary', 'Gambler', 'here', 'associates', 'struggle', 'put', 'together', 'funding', 'two', 'films', 'not', 'get', 'paid', 'just', 'break', 'even', 'moviemaking', 'bankruptcy', 'Also', 'cool', 'are', 'two', 'featurettes', 'how', 'Winding', 'Refn', 'picked', 'amateurs', 'almost-amateurs', 'most', 'gritty', 'roles', 'last', 'two', 'films']",N/A

It was as intriguing and nerve-wracking as the first two but seemed a bit unbeleivable in a few places which I won't go into.  This set is the one to buy though.  If you liked the first one (and it's hard not to), rest asssured the ones that follow keep up the pace.  With these 3 films you  enter the 'pusher' world from the perspective of 3 somewhat different characters.  The main character in Pusher II had played a supporting role in Pusher I.  He's excellent in the second movie as well.  In Pusher III, we get to step into Milo's life - Milo also played the drug lord (and very well I might add) in Pusher I.Although the product picture shown on this Amazon site doesn't seem to have any quote reviews on the case, my copy does.  From the New York Times, ""The Pusher films pull no punch.  They're a knock out.""  From Variety Magazine, ""Cult status on dvd is assured.""  And as shown on this Amazon review, the review from the New York post which (correctly) compares Pusher to early films by Scorcese.These films are in Dutch I think and subtitled in English.

breakthrough Pusher Trilogy.And boy it lived up to my every expectation and now puts NWR as my second favorite film maker after Tarantino and just bumped in front of Takashi Miike.With the Original Pusher being his debut film it reminds me of QT'S Reservoir Dogs although not similar in any way it was just a low-budget visceral masterpiece that launched his career and is every bit as impressive of a debut film as Reservoir dogs.The sequels are equally as good this is the first time where I cannot figure out which film of a trilogy is my favorite.And the way 2 and 3 shift focus on 2 of the supporting characters from the original is sheer brilliance.The first film is definatly the most frenzied and fast paced which follow's low-life addict/pusher Frank played with desperate brilliance by Kim Bodia has he scrambles around over a week's period of time trying to gather up a very large debt which he owes to the chilling and ruthless drug lord Milo(my favorite Pusher character)man does Zlatko Buric just own this role almost like Gandolfini with Tony Soprano.Pusher 2 focuses on Tony played amazingly by Mads Mikkelson who gets out of prison and his loathed by his crime lord ice cold father,can't shake his drug addiction to anything he can get his hands on,and looking at being a father himself.The most emotional and deep of the three.Then Pusher 3 focuses all on Milo who is trying to maintain his grip on the underworld,fix a debt with some slimy Albanians,stay clean,and preparing his daughters birthday,he is far more human and empathetic in this one then the first 2 where we just see him in total control and a take no prisoners like character where in 3 he has to balance his underworld life and his home life the most graphically violent of the 3 as where 2 has the most graphic sexual scene i've ever seen in anything but porn.These films are not for the easily offended or the sqeamish very violent,bleak,and all around ugly.Thats what the life of gangsters,drug dealers and junkies are like and NWR really doesn't hold back and these three films are pure gems and are not to be missed.Now don't expect anything like scorcese or Guy Ritchie these films are hard-core,frenzied camera work and not meant to be polished Hollywood films.But NWR truly is a master writer/director and these films are completly his baby's and must see's for fans of extreme
